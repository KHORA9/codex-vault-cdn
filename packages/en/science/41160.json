When he arrived in London the innocent-looking Quaker was\r\narrested, much to his amazement and dismay, on the charge of having\r\ncommitted a foul murder in the neighbourhood of Slough. The news of\r\nthe murder and a description of the murderer had been telegraphed from\r\nthat place to Paddington, where a detective met the train and shadowed\r\nthe miscreant until a convenient opportunity for arresting him\r\noccurred. Tawell was tried, condemned, and hung, and the public for\r\nthe first time generally realised the power for good dormant in the as\r\nyet little developed electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later two vessels met in mid-Atlantic laden with cables\r\nwhich they joined and paid out in opposite directions, till Ireland\r\nand Newfoundland were reached. The first electric message passed on\r\nAugust 7th of that year from the New World to the Old. The telegraph\r\nhad now become a world-power.\r\n\r\nThe third epoch-making event in its history is of recent date. On\r\nDecember 12, 1901, Guglielmo Marconi, a young Italian, famous all over\r\nthe world when but twenty-two years old, suddenly sprang into yet\r\ngreater fame. At Hospital Point, Newfoundland, he heard by means of a\r\nkite, a long wire, a delicate tube full of tiny particles of metal,\r\nand a telephone ear-piece, signals transmitted from far-off Cornwall\r\nby his colleagues. No wires connected Poldhu, the Cornish station, and\r\nHospital Point. The three short dot signals, which in the Morse code\r\nsignify the letter S, had been borne from place to place by the\r\nlimitless, mysterious ether, that strange substance of which we now\r\nhear so much, of which wise men declare we know so little.\r\n\r\nMarconi’s great achievement, which was of immense importance,\r\nnaturally astonished the world. Of course, there were not wanting\r\nthose who discredited the report. Others, on the contrary, were seized\r\nwith panic and showed their readiness to believe that the Atlantic had\r\nbeen spanned aërially, by selling off their shares in cable companies.\r\nTo use the language of the money-market, there was a temporary “slump”\r\nin cable shares. The world again woke up--this time to the fact that\r\nexperiments of which it had heard faintly had at last culminated in a\r\ngreat triumph, marvellous in itself, and yet probably nothing in\r\ncomparison with the revolution in the transmission of news that it\r\nheralded.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Wireless Telegraphy is so wide that to treat it fully\r\nin the compass of a single chapter is impossible. At the same time it\r\nwould be equally impossible to pass it over in a book written with the\r\nobject of presenting to the reader the latest developments of\r\nscientific research. Indeed, the attention that it has justly\r\nattracted entitle it, not merely to a place, but to a leading place;\r\nand for this reason these first pages will be devoted to a short\r\naccount of the history and theory of Wireless Telegraphy, with some\r\nmention of the different systems by which signals have been sent\r\nthrough space.\r\n\r\nOn casting about for a point at which to begin, the writer is tempted\r\nto attack the great topic of the ether, to which experimenters in many\r\nbranches of science are now devoting more and more attention, hoping\r\nto find in it an explanation of and connection between many phenomena\r\nwhich at present are of uncertain origin.\r\n\r\nWhat is Ether? In the first place, its very existence is merely\r\nassumed, like that of the atom and the molecule. Nobody can say that\r\nhe has actually seen or had any experience of it. The assumption that\r\nthere is such a thing is justified only in so far as that assumption\r\nexplains and reconciles phenomena of which we have experience, and\r\nenables us to form theories which can be scientifically demonstrated\r\ncorrect. What scientists now say is this: that everything which we\r\nsee and touch, the air, the infinity of space itself, is permeated by\r\na _something_, so subtle that, no matter how continuous a thing may\r\nseem, it is but a concourse of atoms separated by this something, the\r\nEther. Reasoning drove them to this conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that an effect cannot come out of nothing. Put a clock\r\nunder a bell-glass and you hear the ticking. Pump out the air and the\r\nticking becomes inaudible. What is now not in the glass that was there\r\nbefore? The air. Reason, therefore, obliges us to conclude that air is\r\nthe means whereby the ticking is audible to us. No air, no sound.\r\nNext, put a lighted candle on the further side of the exhausted\r\nbell-glass. We can see it clearly enough. The absence of air does not\r\naffect light. But can we believe that there is an absolute gap between\r\nus and the light? No! It is far easier to believe that the bell-glass\r\nis as full as the outside atmosphere of the something that\r\ncommunicates the sensation of light from the candle to the eye. Again,\r\nsuppose we measure a bar of iron very carefully while cold and then\r\nheat it. We shall find that it has expanded a little. The iron atoms,\r\nwe say, have become more energetic than before, repel each other and\r\nstand further apart. What then is in the intervening spaces? Not air,\r\nwhich cannot be forced through iron whether hot or cold. No! the\r\nether: which passes easily through crevices so small as to bar the way\r\nto the atoms of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Corner of M. Marconi’s cabin on board S.S.\r\n“Minneapolis,” showing instruments used in Wireless Telegraphy._]\r\n\r\nOnce more, suppose that to one end of our iron bar we apply the\r\nnegative “pole” of an electric battery, and to the other end the\r\npositive pole. We see that a current passes through the bar, whether\r\nhot or cold, which implies that it jumps across all the ether gaps, or\r\nrather is conveyed by them from one atom to another.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion then is that ether is not merely omnipresent,\r\npenetrating all things, but the medium whereby heat, light,\r\nelectricity, perhaps even thought itself, are transmitted from one\r\npoint to another.\r\n\r\nIn what manner is the transmission effected? We cannot imagine the\r\nether behaving in a way void of all system.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, by a wave motion. The ether must be regarded as a very\r\nelastic solid. The agitation of a portion of it by what we call heat,\r\nlight, or electricity, sets in motion adjoining particles, until they\r\nare moving from side to side, but not forwards; the resultant movement\r\nresembling that of a snake tethered by the tail.\r\n\r\nThese ether waves vary immensely in length. Their qualities and\r\neffects upon our bodies or sensitive instruments depend upon their\r\nlength. By means of ingenious apparatus the lengths of various waves\r\nhave been measured. When the waves number 500 billion per second, and\r\nare but the 40,000th of an inch long they affect our eyes and are\r\nnamed light--red light. At double the number and half the length, they\r\ngive us the sensation of violet light.\r\n\r\nWhen the number increases and the waves shorten further, our bodies\r\nare “blind” to them; we have no sense to detect their presence.\r\nSimilarly, a slower vibration than that of red light is imperceptible\r\nuntil we reach the comparatively slow pace of 100 vibrations per\r\nsecond, when we become aware of heat.\r\n\r\nEther waves may be compared to the notes on a piano, of which we are\r\nacquainted with some octaves only. The gaps, the unknown octaves, are\r\nbeing discovered slowly but surely. Thus, for example, the famous\r\nX-rays have been assigned to the topmost octave; electric waves to the\r\nnotes between light and heat. Forty years ago Professor Clerk Maxwell\r\nsuggested that light and electricity were very closely connected,\r\nprobably differing only in their wave-length. His theory has been\r\njustified by subsequent research. The velocity of light (185,000 miles\r\nper second) and that of electric currents have been proved identical.\r\nHertz, a professor in the university of Bonn, also showed (1887-1889)\r\nthat the phenomena of light--reflection, refraction, and concentration\r\nof rays--can be repeated with electric currents.\r\n\r\nWe therefore take the word of scientists that the origin of the\r\nphenomena called light and electricity is the same--vibration of\r\nether. It at once occurs to the reader that their behaviour is so\r\ndifferent that they might as well be considered of altogether\r\ndifferent natures.\r\n\r\nFor instance, interpose the very thinnest sheet of metal between a\r\ncandle and the eye, and the light is cut off. But the sheet will very\r\nreadily convey electricity. On the contrary, glass, a substance that\r\nrepels electricity, is transparent, _i.e._ gives passage to light. And\r\nagain, electricity can be conveyed round as many corners as you\r\nplease, whereas light will travel in straight lines only.\r\n\r\nTo clear away our doubts we have only to take the lighted candle and\r\nagain hold up the metal screen. Light does not pass through, but heat\r\ndoes. Substitute for the metal a very thin tank filled with a solution\r\nof alum, and then light passes, but heat is cut off. So that heat and\r\nelectricity _both_ penetrate what is impenetrable to light; while\r\nlight forces a passage securely barred against both electricity and\r\nheat. And we must remember that open space conveys all alike from the\r\nsun to the earth.\r\n\r\nOn meeting what we call solid matter, ether waves are influenced, not\r\nbecause ether is wanting in the solid matter, but because the presence\r\nof something else than ether affects the intervening ether itself.\r\nConsequently glass, to take an instance, so affects ether that a very\r\nrapid succession of waves (light) are able to continue their way\r\nthrough its interstices, whereas long electric waves are so hampered\r\nthat they die out altogether. Metal on the other hand welcomes slow\r\nvibrations (_i.e._ long waves), but speedily kills the rapid shakes of\r\nlight. In other words, _transparency_ is not confined to light alone.\r\nAll bodies are transparent to some variety of rays, and many bodies to\r\nseveral varieties. It may perhaps even be proved that there is no\r\nsuch thing as absolute resistance, and that our inability to detect\r\npenetration is due to lack of sufficiently delicate instruments.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal points to be remembered are these:--\r\n\r\nThat the ether is a universal medium, conveying all kinds and forms of\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThat these forms of energy differ only in their rates of vibration.\r\n\r\nThat the rate of vibration determines what power of penetration the\r\nwaves shall have through any given substance.\r\n\r\nNow, it is generally true that whereas matter of any kind offers\r\nresistance to light--that is, is not so perfect a conductor as the\r\nether--many substances, especially metals, are more sensitive than\r\nether to heat and electricity. How quickly a spoon inserted into a hot\r\ncup of tea becomes uncomfortably hot, though the hand can be held very\r\nclose to the liquid without feeling more than a gentle warmth. And we\r\nall have noticed that the very least air-gap in an electric circuit\r\neffectively breaks a current capable of traversing miles of wire. If\r\nthe current is so intense that it insists on passing the gap, it leaps\r\nacross with a report, making a spark that is at once intensely bright\r\nand hot. Metal wires are to electricity what speaking tubes are to\r\nsound; they are as it were electrical tubes through the air and ether.\r\nBut just as a person listening outside a speaking tube might faintly\r\nhear the sounds passing through it, so an instrument gifted with an\r\n“electric ear” would detect the currents passing through the wire.\r\nWireless telegraphy is possible because mankind has discovered\r\ninstruments which act as _electric ears or eyes_, catching and\r\nrecording vibrations that had hitherto remained undetected.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known form of wireless telegraphy is transmission of\r\nmessages by light. A man on a hill lights a lamp or a fire. This\r\nrepresents his instrument for agitating the ether into waves, which\r\nproceed straight ahead with incredible velocity until they reach the\r\nreceiver, the eye of a man watching at a point from which the light is\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThen came electric telegraphy.\r\n\r\nAt first a complete circuit (two wires) was used. But in 1838 it was\r\ndiscovered that if instead of two wires only one was used, the other\r\nbeing replaced by an earth connection, not only was the effect equally\r\npowerful, but even double of what it was with the metallic circuit.\r\n\r\nThus the first step had been taken towards wireless electrical\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\nThe second was, of course, to abolish the other wire.\r\n\r\nThis was first effected by Professor Morse, who, in 1842, sent signals\r\nacross the Susquehanna River without metallic connections of any sort.\r\nAlong each bank of the river was stretched a wire three times as long\r\nas the river was broad. In the one wire a battery and transmitter were\r\ninserted, in the other a receiving instrument or galvanometer. Each\r\nwire terminated at each end in a large copper plate sunk in the water.\r\nMorse’s conclusions were that provided the wires were long enough and\r\nthe plates large enough messages could be transmitted for an\r\nindefinite distance; the current passing from plate to plate, though a\r\nlarge portion of it would be lost in the water.[1]\r\n\r\n     [1] It is here proper to observe that the term _wireless_\r\n     telegraphy, as applied to electrical systems, is misleading,\r\n     since it implies the absence of wires; whereas in all systems\r\n     wires are used. But since it is generally understood that by\r\n     wireless telegraphy is meant telegraphy without _metal\r\n     connections_, and because the more improved methods lessen more\r\n     and more the amount of wire used, the phrase has been allowed\r\n     to stand.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date a Scotchman, James Bowman Lindsay of Dundee, a man\r\nas rich in intellectual attainments as he was pecuniarily poor, sent\r\nsignals in a similar manner across the River Tay. In September, 1859,\r\nLindsay read a paper before the British Association at Dundee, in\r\nwhich he maintained that his experiments and calculations assured him\r\nthat by running wires along the coasts of America and Great Britain,\r\nby using a battery having an acting surface of 130 square feet and\r\nimmersed sheets of 3000 square feet, and a coil weighing 300 lbs., he\r\ncould send messages from Britain to America. Want of money prevented\r\nthe poor scholar of Dundee from carrying out his experiments on a\r\nlarge enough scale to obtain public support. He died in 1862, leaving\r\nbehind him the reputation of a man who in the face of the greatest\r\ndifficulties made extraordinary electrical discoveries at the cost of\r\nunceasing labour; and this in spite of the fact that he had undertaken\r\nand partly executed a gigantic dictionary in fifty different\r\nlanguages!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _M. Marconi’s Travelling Station for Wireless\r\nTelegraphy._]\r\n\r\nThe transmission of electrical signals through matter, metal, earth,\r\nor water, is effected by _conduction_, or the _leading_ of the\r\ncurrents in a circuit. When we come to deal with aërial transmission,\r\n_i.e._ where one or both wires are replaced by the ether, then two\r\nmethods are possible, those of _induction_ and Hertzian waves.\r\n\r\nTo take the induction method first. Whenever a current is sent through\r\na wire magnetism is set up in the ether surrounding the wire, which\r\nbecomes the core of a “magnetic field.” The magnetic waves extend for\r\nan indefinite distance on all sides, and on meeting a wire _parallel_\r\nto the electrified wire _induce_ in it a _dynamical_ current similar\r\nto that which caused them. Wherever electricity is present there is\r\nmagnetism also, and _vice versâ_. Electricity--produces\r\nmagnetism--produces electricity. The invention of the Bell telephone\r\nenabled telegraphers to take advantage of this law.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Sir William Preece, now consulting electrical engineer to the\r\nGeneral Post-Office, erected near Newcastle two insulated squares of\r\nwire, each side 440 yards long. The squares were horizontal, parallel,\r\nand a quarter of a mile apart. On currents being sent through the one,\r\ncurrents were detected in the other by means of a telephone, which\r\nremained active even when the squares were separated by 1000 yards.\r\nSir William Preece thus demonstrated that signals could be sent\r\nwithout even an earth connection, _i.e._ entirely through the ether.\r\nIn 1886 he sent signals between two parallel telegraph wires 4-1/2\r\nmiles apart. And in 1892 established a regular communication between\r\nFlatholm, an island fort in the Bristol Channel, and Lavernock, a\r\npoint on the Welsh coast 3-1/3 miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe inductive method might have attained to greater successes had not\r\na formidable rival appeared in the Hertzian waves.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Professor Hertz discovered that if the discharge from a Leyden\r\njar were passed through wires containing an air-gap across which the\r\ndischarge had to pass, sparks would also pass across a gap in an\r\nalmost complete circle or square of wire held at some distance from\r\nthe jar. This “electric eye,” or detector, could have its gap so\r\nregulated by means of a screw that at a certain width its effect would\r\nbe most pronounced, under which condition the detector, or receiver,\r\nwas “in tune” with the exciter, or transmitter. Hertz thus established\r\nthree great facts, that--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) A discharge of static (_i.e._ collected) electricity\r\n     across an air-gap produced strong electric waves in the ether\r\n     on all sides.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) That these waves could be _caught_.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) That under certain conditions the catcher worked most\r\n     effectively.\r\n\r\nOut of these three discoveries has sprung the latest phase of wireless\r\ntelegraphy, as exploited by Signor Marconi. He, in common with\r\nProfessors Branly of Paris, Popoff of Cronstadt, and Slaby of\r\nCharlottenburg, besides many others, have devoted their attention to\r\nthe production of improved means of sending and receiving the Hertzian\r\nwaves. Their experiments have shown that two things are required in\r\nwireless telegraphy--\r\n\r\n     (i.) That the waves shall have great penetrating power, so as\r\n     to pierce any obstacle.\r\n\r\n     (ii.) That they shall retain their energy, so that a _maximum_\r\n     of their original force shall reach the receiver.\r\n\r\nThe first condition is fulfilled best by waves of great length; the\r\nsecond by those which, like light, are of greatest frequency. For best\r\ntelegraphic results a compromise must be effected between these\r\nextremes, neither the thousand-mile long waves of an alternating\r\ndynamo nor the light waves of many thousands to an inch being of use.\r\nThe Hertzian waves are estimated to be 230,000,000 per second; at\r\nwhich rate they would be 1-1/2 yards long. They vary considerably,\r\nhowever, on both sides of this rate and dimension.\r\n\r\nMarconi’s transmitter consists of three parts--a battery; an induction\r\ncoil, terminating in a pair of brass balls, one on each side of the\r\nair-gap; and a Morse transmitting-key. Upon the key being depressed, a\r\ncurrent from the battery passes through the coil and accumulates\r\nelectricity on the brass balls until its tension causes it to leap\r\nfrom one to the other many millions of times in what is called a\r\nspark. The longer the air-gap the greater must be the accumulation\r\nbefore the leap takes place, and the greater the power of the\r\nvibrations set up. Marconi found that by connecting a kite or balloon\r\ncovered with tinfoil by an aluminium wire with one of the balls, the\r\neffect of the waves was greatly increased. Sometimes he replaced the\r\nkite or balloon by a conductor placed on poles two or three hundred\r\nfeet high, or by the mast of a ship.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the receiver.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Professor D. E. Hughes observed that a microphone, in\r\nconnection with a telephone, produced sounds in the latter even when\r\nthe microphone was at a distance of several feet from coils through\r\nwhich a current was passing. A microphone, it may be explained, is in\r\nits simplest form a loose connection in an electric circuit, which\r\ncauses the current to flow in fits and starts at very frequent\r\nintervals. He discovered that a metal microphone stuck, or cohered,\r\nafter a wave had influenced it, but that a carbon microphone was\r\nself-restoring, _i.e._ regained its former position of loose contact\r\nas soon as a wave effect had ceased.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Professor Branly of Paris produced a “coherer,” which was\r\nnothing more than a microphone under another name. Five years later\r\nMarconi somewhat altered Branly’s contrivance, and took out a patent\r\nfor a coherer of his own.\r\n\r\nIt is a tiny glass tube, about two inches long and a tenth of an inch\r\nin diameter inside. A wire enters it at each end, the wires\r\nterminating in two silver plugs fitting the bore of the tube. A space\r\nof 1/32 inch is left between the plugs, and this space is filled with\r\nspecial filings, a mixture of 96 parts of nickel to 4 of silver, and\r\nthe merest trace of mercury. The tube is exhausted of almost all its\r\nair before being sealed.\r\n\r\nThis little gap filled with filings is, except when struck by an\r\nelectric wave, to all practical purposes a non-conductor of\r\nelectricity. The metal particles touch each other so lightly that they\r\noffer great resistance to a current.\r\n\r\nBut when a Hertzian wave flying through the ether strikes the coherer,\r\nthe particles suddenly press hard on one another, and make a bridge\r\nthrough which a current can pass. The current works a “relay,” or\r\ncircuit through which a stronger current passes, opening and closing\r\nit as often as the coherer is influenced by a wave. The relay actuates\r\na tapper that gently taps the tube after each wave-influence, causing\r\nthe particles to _de_cohere in readiness for the succeeding wave, and\r\nalso a Morse instrument for recording words in dots and dashes on a\r\nlong paper tape.\r\n\r\nThe coherer may be said to resemble an engine-driver, and the “relay”\r\nan engine. The driver is not sufficiently strong to himself move a\r\ntrain, but he has strength enough to turn on steam and make the engine\r\ndo the work. The coherer is not suitable for use with currents of the\r\nintensity required to move a Morse recorder, but it easily switches a\r\npowerful current into another circuit.\r\n\r\nWant of space forbids a detailed account of Marconi’s successes with\r\nhis improved instruments, but the appended list will serve to show\r\nhow he gradually increased the distance over which he sent signals\r\nthrough space.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 he came to England. That year he signalled from a room in the\r\nGeneral Post-Office to a station on the roof 100 yards distant.\r\nShortly afterwards he covered 2 miles on Salisbury Plain.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1897, he sent signals from Lavernock Point to Flatholm, 3-1/3\r\nmiles. This success occurred at a critical time, for Sir W. Preece had\r\nalready, as we have seen, bridged the same gap by his induction\r\nmethod, and for three days Marconi failed to accomplish the feat with\r\nhis apparatus, so that it appeared as though the newer system were the\r\nless effective of the two. But by carrying the transmitting instrument\r\non to the beach below the cliff on which it had been standing, and\r\njoining it by a wire to the pole already erected on the top of the\r\ncliff, Mr. Marconi, thanks to a happy inspiration, did just what was\r\nneeded; he got a greater length of wire to send off his waves from.\r\nCommunication was at once established with Flatholm, and on the next\r\nday with Brean Down, on the other side of the Bristol Channel, and\r\n8-2/3 miles distant. Then we have--\r\n\r\n    Needles Hotel to Swanage          17-1/2 miles.\r\n    Salisbury to Bath                     34   \"\r\n    French Coast to Harwich               90   \"\r\n    Isle of Wight to The Lizard          196   \"\r\n    At Sea (1901)                        350   \"\r\n    Dec. 17, 1901, England to America   2099   \"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Poldhu Towers, the Station put down by the Marconi\r\nWireless Telegraph Company, Limited, for carrying on a system of\r\ntransatlantic wireless telegraphy between England and America. From\r\nthe four towers are suspended the ærial wires which are carried into\r\nthe buildings in the centre. The towers are 215 feet in height, and\r\nare made of wood._]\r\n\r\nA more pronounced, though perhaps less sensational, success than even\r\nthis last occurred at the end of February, 1902. Mr. Marconi, during a\r\nvoyage to America on the s.s. _Philadelphia_ remained in communication\r\nwith Poldhu, Cornwall, until the vessel was 1550 miles distant,\r\nreceiving messages on a Morse recorder for any one acquainted with the\r\ncode to read. Signals arrived for a further 500 miles, but owing to\r\nhis instruments not being of sufficient strength, Mr. Marconi could\r\nnot reply.\r\n\r\nWhen the transatlantic achievement was announced at the end of 1901,\r\nthere was a tendency in some quarters to decry the whole system. The\r\ncritics laid their fingers on two weak points.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they said, the speed at which the messages could\r\nbe transmitted was too slow to insure that the system would pay. Mr.\r\nMarconi replied that there had been a time when one word per minute\r\nwas considered a good working rate across the Atlantic cable; whereas\r\nhe had already sent twenty-two words per minute over very long\r\ndistances. A further increase of speed was only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe second objection raised centred on the lack of secrecy resulting\r\nfrom signals being let loose into space to strike any instrument\r\nwithin their range; and also on the confusion that must arise when the\r\nether was traversed by many sets of electric waves.\r\n\r\nThe young Italian inventor had been throughout his experiments aware\r\nof these defects and sought means to remedy them. In his earliest\r\nattempts we find him using parabolic metal screens to project his\r\nwaves in any required direction and prevent their going in any other.\r\nHe also employed strips of metal in conjunction with the coherer, the\r\nstrips or “wings” being of such a size as to respond most readily to\r\nwaves of a certain length.\r\n\r\nThe electric oscillations coming from the aerial wires carried on\r\npoles, kites, &c., were of great power, but their energy dispersed\r\nvery quickly into space in a series of rapidly diminishing vibrations.\r\nThis fact made them affect to a greater or less degree any receiver\r\nthey might encounter on their wanderings. If you go into a room where\r\nthere is a piano and make a loud noise near the instrument a jangle of\r\nnotes results. But if you take a tuning-fork and after striking it\r\nplace it near the strings, only one string will respond, _i.e._ that\r\nof the same pitch as the fork.\r\n\r\nWhat is required in wireless telegraphy is a system corresponding to\r\nthe use of the tuning-fork. Unfortunately, it has been discovered that\r\nthe syntony or tuning of transmitter and receiver reduces the distance\r\nover which they are effective. An electric “noise” is more\r\nfar-reaching than an electric “note.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marconi has, however, made considerable advances towards combining\r\nthe sympathy and secrecy of the tuning system with the power of the\r\n“noise” system. By means of delicately adjusted “wings” and coils he\r\nhas brought it about that a series of waves having small individual\r\nstrength, but great regularity, shall produce on the receiver a\r\n_cumulative_ effect, storing, as it were, electricity on the surface\r\nof the receiver “wings” until it is of sufficient power to overcome\r\nthe resistance of the coherer.\r\n\r\nThat tuned wireless telegraphy is, over moderate distances, at least\r\nas secret as that through wires (which can be tapped by induction) is\r\nevident from the fact that during the America Cup Yacht Races Mr.\r\nMarconi sent daily to the _New York Herald_ messages of 4000 total\r\nwords, and kept them private in spite of all efforts to intercept\r\nthem. He claims to have as many as 250 “tunes”; and, indeed, there\r\nseems to be no limit to their number, so that the would-be “tapper” is\r\nin the position of a man trying to open a letter-lock of which he does\r\nnot know the cipher-word. He _may_ discover the right tune, but the\r\nchances are greatly against him. We may be certain that the rapid\r\nadvance in wireless telegraphy will not proceed much further before\r\nsyntonic messages can be transmitted over hundreds if not thousands of\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to dwell upon the great prospect that the new\r\ntelegraphy opens to mankind. The advantages arising out of a ready\r\nmeans of communication, freed from the shackles of expensive\r\nconnecting wires and cables are, in the main, obvious enough. We have\r\nonly to imagine all the present network of wires replaced or\r\nsupplemented by ether-waves, which will be able to act between points\r\n(_e.g._ ships and ships, ships and land, moving and fixed objects\r\ngenerally) which cannot be connected by metallic circuits.\r\n\r\nAlready ocean voyages are being shortened as regards the time during\r\nwhich passengers are out of contact with the doings of the world. The\r\ntransatlantic journey has now a newsless period of but three days.\r\nNavies are being fitted out with instruments that may play as\r\nimportant a part as the big guns themselves in the next naval war. A\r\ngreat maritime nation like our own should be especially thankful that\r\nthe day is not far distant when our great empire will be connected by\r\ninvisible electric links that no enemy may discover and cut.\r\n\r\nThe romantic side of wireless telegraphy has been admirably touched in\r\nsome words uttered by Professor Ayrton in 1899, after the reading of a\r\npaper by Mr. Marconi before the Institution of Electrical Engineers.\r\n\r\n“If a person wished to call to a friend” (said the Professor), “he\r\nwould use a loud electro-magnetic voice, audible only to him who had\r\nthe electro-magnetic ear.\r\n\r\n“‘Where are you?’ he would say.\r\n\r\n“The reply would come--‘I am at the bottom of a coal mine,’ or\r\n‘Crossing the Andes,’ or ‘In the middle of the Pacific.’ Or, perhaps,\r\nin spite of all the calling, no reply would come, and the person would\r\nthen know his friend was dead. Let them think of what that meant; of\r\nthe calling which went on every day from room to room of a house,\r\nand then imagine that calling extending from pole to pole; not a noisy\r\nbabble, but a call audible to him who wanted to hear and absolutely\r\nsilent to him who did not.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Guglielmo Marconi._]\r\n\r\nWhen will Professor Ayrton’s forecast come true? Who can say? Science\r\nis so full of surprises that the ordinary man wonders with a semi-fear\r\nwhat may be the next development; and wise men like Lord Kelvin humbly\r\nconfess that in comparison with what has yet to be learnt about the\r\nmysterious inner workings of Nature their knowledge is but as\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-SPEED TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wonderful developments of wireless telegraphy must not make us\r\nforget that some very interesting and startling improvements have been\r\nmade in connection with the ordinary wire-circuit method: notably in\r\nthe matter of speed.\r\n\r\nAt certain seasons of the year or under special circumstances which\r\ncan scarcely be foreseen, a great rush takes place to transmit\r\nmessages over the wires connecting important towns. Now, the best\r\ntelegraphists can with difficulty keep up a transmitting speed of even\r\nfifty words a minute for so long as half-an-hour. The Morse alphabet\r\ncontains on the average three signals for each letter, and the average\r\nlength of a word is six letters. Fifty words would therefore contain\r\nbetween them 900 signals, or fifteen a second. The strain of sending\r\nor noting so many for even a brief period is very wearisome to the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nMeans have been found of replacing the telegraph clerk, so far as the\r\nactual signalling is concerned, by mechanical devices.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Alexander Bain, a watchmaker of Thurso, produced what is known\r\nas a “chemical telegraph.” The words to be transmitted were set up in\r\nlarge metal type, all capitals, connected with the positive pole of\r\na battery, the negative pole of which was connected to earth. A metal\r\nbrush, divided into five points, each terminating a wire, was passed\r\nover the metal type. As often as a division of the brush touched metal\r\nit completed the electric circuit in the wire to which it was joined,\r\nand sent a current to the receiving station, where a similar brush was\r\npassing at similar speed over a strip of paper soaked in iodide of\r\npotassium. The action of the electricity decomposed the solution,\r\nturning it blue or violet. The result was a series of letters divided\r\nlongitudinally into five belts separated by white spaces representing\r\nthe intervals between the contact points of the brush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The receiving instrument used by Messrs. Pollak &\r\nVirag in their high-speed system of telegraphy. This instrument is\r\ncapable of receiving and photographically recording messages at the\r\nastonishing speed of 50,000 words an hour._]\r\n\r\nThe Bain Chemical Telegraph was able to transmit the enormous number\r\nof 1500 words per minute; that is, at ten times the rate of ordinary\r\nconversation! But even when improvements had reduced the line wires\r\nfrom five to one, the system, on account of the method of composing\r\nthe message to be sent, was not found sufficiently practical to come\r\ninto general use.\r\n\r\nIts place was taken by slower but preferable systems: those of duplex\r\nand multiplex telegraphy.\r\n\r\nWhen a message is sent over the wires, the actual time of making the\r\nsignals is more than is required for the current to pass from place to\r\nplace. This fact has been utilised by the inventors of methods whereby\r\ntwo or more messages may not only be sent the _same_ way along the\r\nsame wire, but may also be sent in _different_ directions. Messages\r\nare “duplex” when they travel across one another, “multiplex” when\r\nthey travel together.\r\n\r\nThe principle whereby several instruments are able to use the same\r\nwire is that of _distributing_ among the instruments the time during\r\nwhich they are in contact with the line.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that four transmitters are sending messages\r\nsimultaneously from London to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nWires from all four instruments are led into a circular contact-maker,\r\ndivided into some hundreds of insulated segments connected in rotation\r\nwith the four transmitters. Thus instrument A will be joined to\r\nsegments 1, 5, 9, 13; instrument B to segments 2, 6, 10, 14;\r\ninstrument C with segments 3, 7, 11, 15; and so on.\r\n\r\nAlong the top of the segments an arm, connected with the telegraph\r\nline to Edinburgh, revolves at a uniform rate. For about 1/500 of a\r\nsecond it unites a segment with an instrument. If there are 150\r\nsegments on the “distributor,” and the arm revolves three times a\r\nsecond, each instrument will be put into contact with the line rather\r\noftener than 110 times per second. And if the top speed of fifty words\r\na minute is being worked to, each of the fifteen signals occurring in\r\neach second will be on the average divided among seven moments of\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nA similar apparatus at Edinburgh receives the messages. It is evident\r\nthat for the system to work satisfactorily, or even to escape dire\r\nconfusion, the revolving arms must run at a level speed in perfect\r\nunison with one another. When the London arm is over segment 1, the\r\nEdinburgh arm must cover the same number. The greatest difficulty in\r\nmultiplex telegraphy has been to adjust the timing exactly.\r\n\r\nPaul la Cour of Copenhagen invented for driving the arms a device\r\ncalled the Phonic Wheel, as its action was regulated by the vibrations\r\nof a tuning-fork. The wheel, made of soft iron, and toothed on its\r\ncircumference, revolves at a short distance from the pole of a magnet.\r\nAs often as a current enters the magnet the latter attracts the\r\nnearest tooth of the wheel; and if a regular series of currents pass\r\nthrough it the motion of the wheel will be uniform. M. la Cour\r\nproduced the regularity of current impulses in the motor magnet by\r\nmeans of a tuning-fork, which is unable to vibrate more than a certain\r\nnumber of times a second, and at each vibration closed a circuit\r\nsending current into the magnet. To get two tuning-forks of the same\r\nnote is an easy matter; and consequently a uniformity of rotation at\r\nboth London and Edinburgh stations may be insured.\r\n\r\nSo sensitive is this “interrupter” system that as many as sixteen\r\nmessages can be sent simultaneously, which means that a single wire is\r\nconveying from 500 to 800 words a minute. We can easily understand the\r\nhuge saving that results from such a system; the cost of instruments,\r\ninterrupter, &c., being but small in proportion to that of a number\r\nof separate conductors.\r\n\r\nThe word-sending capacity of a line may be even further increased by\r\nthe use of automatic transmitters able to work much faster in\r\nsignal-making than the human brain and hand. Sir Charles Wheatstone’s\r\nAutomatic Transmitter has long been used in the Post-Office\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe messages to be sent are first of all punched on a long tape with\r\nthree parallel rows of perforations. The central row is merely for\r\nguiding the tape through the transmitting machine. The positions of\r\nthe holes in the two outside rows relatively to each other determine\r\nthe character of the signal to be sent. Thus, when three holes\r\n(including the central one) are abreast, a Morse “dot” is signified;\r\nwhen the left-hand hole is one place behind the right hand, a “dash”\r\nwill be telegraphed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a long communication the matter is divided among a\r\nnumber of clerks operating punching machines. Half-a-dozen operators\r\ncould between them punch holes representing 250 to 300 words a minute;\r\nand the transmitter is capable of despatching as many in the same\r\ntime, while it has the additional advantage of being tireless.\r\n\r\nThe action of the transmitter is based upon the reversal of the\r\ndirection or nature of current. The punched tape is passed between an\r\noscillating lever, carrying two points, and plates connected with the\r\ntwo poles of the battery. As soon as a hole comes under a pin the pin\r\ndrops through and makes a contact.\r\n\r\nAt the receiving end the wire is connected with a coil wound round the\r\npole of a permanent bar-magnet. Such a magnet has what is known as a\r\nnorth pole and a south pole, the one attractive and the other\r\nrepulsive of steel or soft iron. Any bar of soft iron can be made\r\ntemporarily into a magnet by twisting round it a few turns of a wire\r\nin circuit with the poles of a battery. But which will be the north\r\nand which the south pole depends on the _direction_ of the current.\r\nIf, then, a current passes in one direction round the north pole of a\r\npermanent magnet it will increase the magnet’s attractive power, but\r\nwill decrease it if sent in the other direction.\r\n\r\nThe “dot” holes punched in the tape being abreast cause first a\r\npositive and then a negative current following at a very short\r\ninterval; but the “dash” holes not being opposite allow the positive\r\ncurrent to occupy the wires for a longer period. Consequently the\r\nMorse marker rests for correspondingly unequal periods on the\r\nrecording “tape,” giving out a series of dots and dashes, as the inker\r\nis snatched quickly or more leisurely from the paper.\r\n\r\nThe Wheatstone recorder has been worked up to 400 words a minute, and\r\nwhen two machines are by the multiplex method acting together this\r\nrate is of course doubled.\r\n\r\nAs a speed machine it has, however, been completely put in the shade\r\nby a more recent invention of two Hungarian electricians, Anton Pollak\r\nand Josef Virag, which combines the perforated strip method of\r\ntransmission with the telephone and photography. The message is sent\r\noff by means of a punched tape, and is recorded by means of a\r\ntelephonic diaphragm and light marking a sensitised paper.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the inventors made trials of their system for the benefit of\r\nthe United Electrical Company of Buda-Pesth. The Hungarian capital was\r\nconnected by two double lines of wire with a station 200 miles\r\ndistant, where the two sets were joined so as to give a single circuit\r\nof 400 miles in length. A series of tests in all weathers showed that\r\nthe Pollak-Virag system could transmit as many as 100,000 words an\r\nhour over that distance.\r\n\r\nFrom Hungary the inventors went to the United States, in which country\r\nof “records” no less than 155,000 words were despatched and received\r\nin the sixty minutes. This average--2580 words per minute, 43 per\r\nsecond--is truly remarkable! Even between New York and Chicago,\r\nseparated by 950 odd miles, the wires kept up an average of 1000 per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus that produces these marvellous results is of two types.\r\nThe one type records messages in the Morse alphabet, the other makes\r\nclearly-written longhand characters. The former is the faster of the\r\ntwo, but the legibility of the other more than compensates for the\r\ndecrease of speed by one-half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Specimens of the punched tape used for transmitting\r\nmessages by the Pollak-Virag system, and of a message as it is\r\ndelivered by the receiving machine._]\r\n\r\nThe Morse alphabet method closely resembles the Wheatstone system. The\r\nmessage is prepared for transmission by being punched on a tape. But\r\nthere is this difference in the position of the holes, that whereas in\r\nthe Wheatstone method two holes are used for each dot and dash, only\r\none is required in the Pollak-Virag. If to the right of the central\r\nguiding line it signifies a “dash,” if to the left, a “dot.”\r\n\r\nThe “reversal-of-current” method, already explained, causes at the\r\nreceiver end an increase or decrease in the power of a permanent\r\nmagnet to attract or repel a diaphragm, the centre of which is\r\nconnected by a very fine metal bar with the centre of a tiny mirror\r\nhinged at one side on two points. A very slight movement of the\r\ndiaphragm produces an exaggerated movement of the mirror, which, as it\r\ntilts backwards and forwards, reflects the light from an electric lamp\r\non to a lens, which concentrates the rays into a bright spot, and\r\nfocuses them on to a surface of sensitised paper.\r\n\r\nIn their earliest apparatus the inventors attached the paper to the\r\ncircumference of a vertical cylinder, which revolved at an even pace\r\non an axle, furnished at the lower end with a screw thread, so that\r\nthe portion of paper affected by the light occupied a spiral path from\r\ntop to bottom of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn a later edition, however, an endless band of sensitised paper is\r\nemployed, and the lamp is screened from the mirror by a horizontal\r\nmantle in which is cut a helical slit making one complete turn of the\r\ncylinder in its length. The mantle is rotated in unison with the\r\nmachinery driving the sensitised band; and as it revolves, the spot at\r\nwhich the light from the filament can pass through the slit to the\r\nmirror is constantly shifting from right to left, and the point at\r\nwhich the reflected light from the mirror strikes the sensitised paper\r\nfrom left to right. At the moment when a line is finished, the right\r\nextremity of the mantle begins to pass light again, and the bright\r\nspot of light recommences its work at the left edge of the band, which\r\nhas now moved on a space.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the mirror backwards and forwards produce on the\r\npaper a zigzag tracing known as syphon-writing. The record, which is\r\ncontinuous from side to side of the band, is a series of zigzag\r\nup-and-down strokes, corresponding to the dots and dashes of the Morse\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for transmitting longhand characters is more complicated\r\nthan that just described. Two telephones are now used, and the punched\r\ntape has in it five rows of perforations.\r\n\r\nIf we take a copy-book and examine the letters, we shall see that they\r\nall occupy one, two, or three bands of space. For instance, _a_,\r\nbetween the lines, occupies one band; _g_, two bands; and _f_, three.\r\nIn forming letters, the movements of the fingers trace curves and\r\nstraight lines, the curves being the resultants of combined horizontal\r\nand vertical movements.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Pollak and Virag, in order to produce curves, were obliged to\r\nadd a second telephone, furnished also with a metal bar joined to the\r\nmirror, which rests on three points instead of on two. One of these\r\npoints is fixed, the other two represent the ends of the two diaphragm\r\nbars, which move the mirror vertically and horizontally respectively,\r\neither separately or simultaneously.\r\n\r\nA word about the punched paper before going further. It contains, as\r\nwe have said, five rows of perforations. The top three of these are\r\nconcerned only with the up-and-down strokes of the letters, the bottom\r\ntwo with the cross strokes. When a hole of one set is acting in unison\r\nwith a hole of the other set a composite movement or curve results.\r\n\r\nThe topmost row of all sends through the wires a negative current of\r\nknown strength; this produces upward and return strokes in the upper\r\nzone of the letters: for instance, the upper part of a _t_. The second\r\nrow passes _positive_ currents of equal strength with the negative,\r\nand influences the up-and-down strokes of the centre zone, _e.g._\r\nthose of _o_; the third row passes positive currents _twice_ as strong\r\nas the negative, and is responsible for double-length vertical strokes\r\nin the centre and lower zones, _e.g._ the stroke in _p_.\r\n\r\nIn order that the record shall not be a series of zigzags it is\r\nnecessary that the return strokes in the vertical elements shall be on\r\nthe same path as the out strokes; and as the point of light is\r\ncontinuously tending to move from left to right of the paper there\r\nmust at times be present a counteracting tendency counterbalancing it\r\nexactly, so that the path of the light point is purely vertical. At\r\nother times not merely must the horizontal movements balance each\r\nother, but the right-to-left element must be stronger than the\r\nleft-to-right, so that strokes such as the left curve of an _e_ may be\r\npossible. To this end rows 4 and 5 of the perforations pass currents\r\nworking the second telephone diaphragm, which moves the mirror on a\r\nvertical axis so that it reflects the ray horizontally.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the holes in rows 3, 4, 5 vary in size to\r\npermit the passage of currents during periods of different length. In\r\nthis manner the little junction-hooks of such letters as _r_, _w_,\r\n_v_, _b_ are effected.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the sensitised paper strip is covered with the movements of\r\nthe dancing spot of light it is passed on over rollers through\r\ndeveloping and fixing chemical baths; so that the receiving of\r\nmessages is purely automatic.\r\n\r\nThe reader can judge for himself the results of this ingenious system\r\nas shown in a short section of a message transmitted by Mr. Pollak.\r\nThe words shown actually occupied two seconds in transmission. They\r\nare beautifully clear.\r\n\r\nIt is said that by the aid of a special “multiplex” device thirty sets\r\nof Pollak-Virag apparatus can be used simultaneously on a line! The\r\nreader will be able, by the aid of a small calculation, to arrive at\r\nsome interesting figures as regards their united output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA common enough sight in any large town is a great sheaf of fine wires\r\nrunning across the streets and over the houses. If you traced their\r\ncareer in one direction you would find that they suddenly terminate,\r\nor rather combine into cables, and disappear into the recesses of a\r\nhouse, which is the Telephone Exchange. If you tracked them the other\r\nway your experience would be varied enough. Some wires would lead you\r\ninto public institutions, some into offices, some into snug rooms in\r\nprivate houses. At one time your journey would end in the town, at\r\nanother you would find yourself roaming far into the country, through\r\ngreen fields and leafy lanes until at last you ran the wire to earth\r\nin some large mansion standing in a lordly park. Perhaps you might\r\nhave to travel hundreds of miles, having struck a “trunk” line\r\nconnecting two important cities; or you might even be called upon to\r\nturn fish and plunge beneath the sea for a while, groping your way\r\nalong a submarine cable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visible overhead wires that traverse a town there\r\nare many led underground through special conduits. And many telephone\r\nwires never come out of doors at all, their object being to furnish\r\ncommunication between the rooms of the same house. The telephone and\r\nits friend, the electric-bell, are now a regular part of the equipment\r\nof any large premises. The master of the house goes to his telephone\r\nwhen he wishes to address the cook or the steward, or the\r\nhead-gardener or the coachman. It saves time and labour.\r\n\r\nShould he desire to speak to his town-offices he will, unless\r\nconnected direct, “ring up” the Exchange, into which, as we have seen,\r\nflow all the wires of the subscribers to the telephone system of that\r\ndistrict. The ringing-up is usually done by rapidly turning a handle\r\nwhich works an electric magnet and rings a bell in the Exchange. The\r\noperator there, generally a girl, demands the number of the person\r\nwith whom the ringer wants to speak, rings up that number, and\r\nconnects the wires of the two parties.\r\n\r\nIn some exchanges, _e.g._ the new Post-Office telephone exchanges, the\r\nplace of electric-bells is taken by lamps, to the great advantage of\r\nthe operators, whose ears are thus freed from perpetual jangling. The\r\naction of unhooking the telephone receiver at the subscriber’s end\r\nsends a current into a relay which closes the circuit of an electric\r\nlamp opposite the subscriber’s number in the exchange. Similarly, when\r\nthe conversation is completed the action of hanging up the receiver\r\nagain lights another lamp of a different colour, given the exchange\r\nwarning that the wires are free again.\r\n\r\nIn America, the country of automatic appliances, the operator is\r\nsometimes entirely dispensed with. A subscriber is able, by means of\r\na mechanical contrivance, to put himself in communication with any\r\nother subscriber unless that subscriber is engaged, in which case a\r\ndial records the fact.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the telephone may be judged from the fact that in\r\n1901 the National Telephone Company’s system transmitted over 807\r\nmillions of messages, as compared with 89 millions of telegrams sent\r\nover the Post Office wires. In America and Germany, however, the\r\ntelephone is even more universally employed than in England. In the\r\nthinly populated prairies of West America the farm-houses are often\r\nconnected with a central station many miles off, from which they\r\nreceive news of the outer world and are able to keep in touch with one\r\nanother. We are not, perhaps, as a nation sufficiently alive to the\r\nadvantages of an efficient telephone system; and on this account many\r\ndistricts remain telephoneless because sufficient subscribers cannot\r\nbe found to guarantee use of a system if established. It has been\r\nseriously urged that much of our country depopulation might be\r\ncounteracted by a universal telephone service, which would enable\r\npeople to live at a distance from the towns and yet be in close\r\ncontact with them. At present, for the sake of convenience and ease of\r\n“getting at” clients and customers, many business men prefer to have\r\ntheir homes just outside the towns where their business is. A cheap\r\nand efficient service open to every one would do away with a great\r\ndeal of travelling that is necessary under existing circumstances,\r\nand by making it less important to live near a town allow people to\r\nreturn to the country.\r\n\r\nEven Norway has a good telephone system. The telegraph is little used\r\nin the more thinly inhabited districts, but the telephone may be found\r\nin most unexpected places, in little villages hidden in the recesses\r\nof the fiords. Switzerland, another mountainous country, but very\r\ngo-ahead in all electrical matters, is noted for the cheapness of its\r\ntelephone services. At Berne or Geneva a subscriber pays £4 the first\r\nyear, £2, 12s. the second year, and but £1, 12s. the third. Contrast\r\nthese charges with those of New York, where £15, 10s. to £49, 10s. is\r\nlevied annually according to service.\r\n\r\nThe telephone as a public benefactor is seen at its best at\r\nBuda-Pesth, the twin-capital of Hungary. In 1893, one Herr Theodore\r\nBuschgasch founded in that city a “newspaper”--if so it may be\r\ncalled--worked entirely on the telephone. The publishing office was a\r\ntelephone exchange; the wires and instruments took the place of\r\nprinted matter. The subscribers were to be informed entirely by ear of\r\nthe news of the day.\r\n\r\nThe _Telefon Hirmondo_ or “Telephonic Newsteller,” as the “paper” was\r\nnamed, has more than six thousand subscribers, who enjoy their\r\ntelephones for the very small payment of eighteen florins, or about a\r\npenny a day, for twelve hours a day.\r\n\r\nNews is collected at the central office in the usual journalistic way\r\nby telephone, telegraph, and reporters. It is printed by lithography\r\non strips of paper six inches wide and two feet long. These strips are\r\nhanded to “stentors,” or men with powerful and trained voices, who\r\nread the contents to transmitting instruments in the offices, whence\r\nit flies in all directions to the ears of the subscribers.\r\n\r\nThese last know exactly when to listen and what description of\r\ninformation they will hear, for each has over his receiver a programme\r\nwhich is rigidly adhered to. It must be explained at once that the\r\n_Telefon Hirmondo_ is more than a mere newspaper, for it adds to its\r\npractical use as a first-class journal that of entertainer, lecturer,\r\npreacher, actor, political speaker, musician. The _Telefon_ offices\r\nare connected by wire with the theatres, churches, and public halls,\r\ndrawing from them by means of special receivers the sounds that are\r\ngoing on there, and transmitting them again over the wires to the\r\nthousands of subscribers. The Buda-Pesthian has therefore only to\r\nconsult his programme to see when he will be in touch with his\r\nfavourite actor or preacher. The ladies know just when to expect the\r\nlatest hints about the fashions of the day. Nor are the children\r\nforgotten, for a special period is set aside weekly for their\r\nentertainment in the shape of lectures or concerts.\r\n\r\nThe advertising fiend, too, must have his say, though he pays dearly\r\nfor it. On payment of a florin the stentors will shout the virtues of\r\nhis wares for a space of twelve seconds. The advertising periods are\r\nsandwiched in between items of news, so that the subscriber is bound\r\nto hear the advertisements unless he is willing to risk missing some\r\nof the news if he hangs up his receiver until the “puff” is finished.\r\n\r\nThanks to the _Telefon Hirmondo_ the preacher, actor, or singer is\r\nobliged to calculate his popularity less by the condition of the seats\r\nin front of him than by the number of telephones in use while he is\r\nperforming his part. On the other hand, the subscriber is spared a\r\nvast amount of walking, waiting, cab-hire, and expense generally. In\r\nfact, if the principle is much further developed, we shall begin to\r\ndoubt whether a Buda-Pesthian will be able to discover reasons for\r\ngetting out of bed at all if the receiver hanging within reach of his\r\nhand is the entrance to so many places of delight. Will he become a\r\nvery lazy person; and what will be the effect on his entertainers when\r\nthey find themselves facing benches that are used less every day? Will\r\nthe sight of a row of telephone trumpets rouse the future Liddon,\r\nPatti, Irving, or Gladstone to excel themselves? It seems rather\r\ndoubtful. Telephones cannot look interested or applaud.\r\n\r\nWhat is inside the simple-looking receiver that hangs on the wall\r\nbeside a small mahogany case, or rests horizontally on a couple of\r\ncrooks over the case? In the older type of instrument the transmitter\r\nand receiver are separate, the former fixed in front of the case, the\r\nlatter, of course, movable so that it can be applied to the ear. But\r\nimproved patterns have transmitter and receiver in a single movable\r\nhandle, so shaped that the earpiece is by the ear while the\r\nmouthpiece curves round opposite the mouth. By pressing a small lever\r\nwith the fingers the one or the other is brought into action when\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the instrument, of which we are at first a little\r\nafraid, and with which we later on learn to become rather angry, is in\r\nits general lines simple enough. The first practical telephone,\r\nconstructed in 1876 by Graham Bell, a Scotchman, consisted of a long\r\nwooden or ebonite handle down the centre of which ran a permanent\r\nbar-magnet, having at one end a small coil of fine insulated wire\r\nwound about it The ends of the wire coil are led through the handles\r\nto two terminals for connection with the line wires. At a very short\r\ndistance from the wire-wound pole of the magnet is firmly fixed by its\r\nedges a thin circular iron plate, covered by a funnel-shaped\r\nmouthpiece.\r\n\r\nThe iron plate is, when at rest, concave, its centre being attracted\r\ntowards the pole of the magnet. When any one speaks into the\r\nmouthpiece the sound waves agitate the diaphragm (or plate), causing\r\nits centre to move inwards and outwards. The movements of the\r\ndiaphragm affect the magnetism of the magnet, sometimes strengthening\r\nit, sometimes weakening it, and consequently exciting electric\r\ncurrents of varying strength in the wire coil. These currents passing\r\nthrough the line wires to a similar telephone excite the coil in it,\r\nand in turn affect the magnetism of the distant magnet, which\r\nattracts or releases the diaphragm near its pole, causing undulations\r\nof the air exactly resembling those set up by the speaker’s words. To\r\nrender the telephone powerful enough to make conversation possible\r\nover long distances it was found advisable to substitute for the one\r\ntelephone a special transmitter, and to insert in the circuit a\r\nbattery giving a much stronger current than could possibly be excited\r\nby the magnet in the telephone at the speaker’s end.\r\n\r\nEdison in 1877 invented a special transmitter made of carbon. He\r\ndiscovered that the harder two faces of carbon are pressed together\r\nthe more readily will they allow current to pass; the reason probably\r\nbeing that the points of contact increase in number and afford more\r\nbridges for the current.\r\n\r\nAccordingly his transmitter contains a small disc of lampblack (a form\r\nof carbon) connected to the diaphragm, and another carbon or platinum\r\ndisc against which the first is driven with varying force by the\r\nvibrations of the voice.\r\n\r\nThe Edison transmitter is therefore in idea only a modification of the\r\nmicrophone. It acts as a _regulator_ of current, in distinction to the\r\nBell telephone, which is only an _exciter_ of current. Modern forms of\r\ntelephones unite the Edison transmitter with the Bell receiver.\r\n\r\nThe latter is extremely sensitive to electric currents, detecting them\r\neven when of the minutest power. We have seen that Marconi used a\r\ntelephone in his famous transatlantic experiments to distinguish the\r\nsignals sent from Cornwall. A telephone may be used with an “earth\r\nreturn” instead of a second wire; but as this exposes it to stray\r\ncurrents by induction from other wires carried on the same poles or\r\nfrom the earth itself, it is now usual to use two wires, completing\r\nthe metallic circuit. Even so a subscriber is liable to overhear\r\nconversations on wires neighbouring his own; the writer has lively\r\nrecollections of first receiving news of the relief of Ladysmith in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\nOwing to the self-induction of wires in submarine cables and the\r\nconsequent difficulty of forcing currents through them, the telephone\r\nis at present not used in connection with submarine lines of more than\r\na very moderate length. England has, however, been connected with\r\nFrance by a telephone cable from St. Margaret’s Bay to Sangatte, 23\r\nmiles; and Scotland with Ireland, Stranraer to Donaghadee, 26 miles.\r\nThe former cable enables speech between London and Marseilles, a\r\ndistance of 900 miles; and the latter makes it possible to speak from\r\nLondon to Dublin _viâ_ Glasgow. The longest direct line in existence\r\nis that between New York and Chicago, the complete circuit of which\r\nuses 1900 miles of stout copper wire, raised above the ground on poles\r\n35 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the telephone on a well laid system is so great that\r\nit makes very little difference whether the persons talking with one\r\nanother are 50 or 500 miles apart. There is no reason why a\r\nCape-to-Cairo telephone should not put the two extremities of Africa\r\nin clear vocal communication. We may even live to see the day when a\r\nLondon business man will be able to talk with his agent in Sydney,\r\nMelbourne, or Wellington.\r\n\r\nA step towards this last achievement has been taken by M. Germain, a\r\nFrench electrician, who has patented a telephone which can be used\r\nwith stronger currents than are possible in ordinary telephones;\r\nthereby, of course, increasing the range of speech on submarine\r\ncables.\r\n\r\nThe telephone that we generally use has a transmitter which permits\r\nbut a small portion of the battery power to pass into the wires, owing\r\nto the resistance of the carbon diaphragm. The weakness of the current\r\nis to a great extent compensated by the exceedingly delicate nature of\r\nthe receiver.\r\n\r\nM. Germain has reversed the conditions with a transmitter that allows\r\na very high percentage of the current to flow into the wires, and a\r\ncomparatively insensitive receiver. The result is a “loud-speaking\r\ntelephone”--not a novelty, for Edison invented one as long ago as\r\n1877--which is capable of reproducing speech in a wonderfully powerful\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nM. Germain, with the help of special tubular receivers, has actually\r\nsent messages through a line having the same resistance as that of the\r\nLondon-Paris line, so audibly that the words could be heard fifteen\r\nyards from the receiver in the open air!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Telephone\r\n\r\nWIRELESS TELEPHONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn days when wireless telegraphy is occupying such a great deal of the\r\nworld’s attention, it is not likely to cause much astonishment in the\r\nreader to learn that wireless transmission of _speech_ over\r\nconsiderable distances is an accomplished fact. We have already\r\nmentioned (see “Wireless Telegraphy”) that by means of parallel\r\nsystems of wires Sir William Preece bridged a large air-gap, and\r\ninduced in the one sounds imparted to the other.\r\n\r\nSince then two other methods have been introduced; and as a preface to\r\nthe mention of the first we may say a few words about Graham Bell’s\r\n_Photophone_.\r\n\r\nIn this instrument _light_ is made to do the work of a metal\r\nconnection between speaker and listener. Professor Bell, in arranging\r\nthe Photophone, used a mouthpiece as in his electric telephone, but\r\ninstead of a diaphragm working in front of a magnet to set up electric\r\nimpulses along a wire he employed a mirror of very thin glass,\r\nsilvered on one side. The effect of sound on this mirror was to cause\r\nrapid alterations of its shape from concave to convex, and consequent\r\nvariations of its reflecting power. A strong beam of light was\r\nconcentrated on the centre of the mirror through a lens, and reflected\r\nby the mirror at an angle through another lens in the direction of the\r\nreceiving instrument. The receiver consisted of a parabolic reflector\r\nto catch the rays and focus them on a selenium cell connected by an\r\nelectric circuit with an ordinary telephone earpiece.\r\n\r\nOn delivering a message into the mouthpiece the speaker would, by\r\nagitating the mirror, send a succession of light waves of varying\r\nintensity towards the distant selenium cell. Selenium has the peculiar\r\nproperty of offering less resistance to electrical currents when light\r\nis thrown upon it than when it is in darkness: and the more intense is\r\nthe light the less is the obstruction it affords. The light-waves from\r\nthe mirror, therefore, constantly alter its capacity as a conductor,\r\nallowing currents to pass through the telephone with varying power.\r\n\r\nIn this way Professor Bell bridged 800 yards of space; over which he\r\nsent, besides articulate words, musical notes, using for the latter\r\npurpose a revolving perforated disc to interrupt a constant beam of\r\nlight a certain number of times per second. As the speed of the disc\r\nincreased the rate of the light-flashes increased also, and produced\r\nin the selenium cell the same number of passages to the electric\r\ncurrent, converted into a musical note by the receiver. So that by\r\nmeans of mechanical apparatus a “playful sunbeam” could literally be\r\ncompelled to play a tune.\r\n\r\nFrom the Photophone we pass to another method of sound transmission by\r\nlight, with which is connected the name of Mr. Hammond V. Hayes of\r\nBoston, Massachusetts. It is embodied in the Radiophone, or the\r\nRay-speaker, for it makes strong rays of light carry the human voice.\r\n\r\nLuminous bodies give off heat. As the light increases, so as a general\r\nrule does the heat also. At present we are unable to create strong\r\nlight without having recourse to heat to help us, since we do not know\r\nhow to cause other vibrations of sufficient rapidity to yield the\r\nsensation of light. But we can produce heat directly, and heat will\r\nset atoms in motion, and the ether too, giving us light, but taking as\r\nreward a great deal of the energy exerted. Now, the electric arc of a\r\nsearchlight produces a large amount of light _and_ heat. The light is\r\nfelt by the eye at a distance of many miles, but the body is not\r\nsensitive enough to be aware of the heat emanating from the same\r\nsource. Mr. Hayes has, however, found the heat accompanying a\r\nsearchlight beam quite sufficient to affect a mechanical “nerve” in a\r\nfar-away telephone receiver.\r\n\r\nThe transmitting apparatus is a searchlight, through the back of which\r\nrun four pairs of wires connected with a telephone mouthpiece after\r\npassing through a switch and resistance-box or regulator. The receiver\r\nis a concave mirror, in the focus of which is a tapering glass bulb,\r\nhalf filled with carbonised filament very sensitive to heat. The\r\ntapering end of the bulb projects through the back of the mirror into\r\nan ear tube.\r\n\r\nIf a message is to be transmitted the would-be speaker turns his\r\nsearchlight in the direction of the person with whom he wishes to\r\nconverse, and makes the proper signals. On seeing them the other\r\npresents his mirror to the beam and listens.\r\n\r\nThe speaker’s voice takes control of the searchlight beam. The louder\r\nthe sound the more brilliantly glows the electric arc; the stronger\r\nbecomes the beam, the greater is the amount of heat passed on to the\r\nmirror and gathered on the sensitive bulb. The filament inside\r\nexpands. The tapering point communicates the fact to the earpiece.\r\n\r\nThis operation being repeated many times a second the earpiece fills\r\nwith sound, in which all the modulations of the far-distant voice are\r\neasily distinguishable.\r\n\r\nTwo sets of the apparatus above described are necessary for a\r\nconversation, the functions of the searchlight and the bulb not being\r\nreversible. But inasmuch as all large steamers carry searchlights the\r\nnecessary installation may be completed at a small expense. Mr. Hayes’\r\ninvention promises to be a rival to wireless telegraphy over\r\ncomparatively short distances. It can be relied upon in all weathers,\r\nand is a fast method of communication. Like the photophone it\r\nillustrates the inter-relationship of the phenomena of Sound, Light,\r\nand Heat, and the readiness with which they may be combined to attain\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nNext we turn from air to earth, and to the consideration of the work\r\nof Mr. A. F. Collins of Philadelphia. This electrician merely makes\r\nuse of the currents flowing in all directions through the earth, and\r\nthose excited by an electric battery connected with earth. The outfit\r\nrequisite for sending wireless spoken messages consists of a couple of\r\nconvenient stands, as many storage batteries, sets of coils, and\r\nreceiving and transmitting instruments.\r\n\r\nThe action of the transmitter is to send from the battery a series of\r\ncurrents through the coils, which transmit them, greatly intensified,\r\nto the earth by means of a wire connected with a buried wire-screen.\r\nThe electric disturbances set up in the earth travel in all\r\ndirections, and strike a similar screen buried beneath the receiving\r\ninstrument, where the currents affect the delicate diaphragm of the\r\ntelephone earpiece.\r\n\r\nThe system is, in fact, upon all fours with Mr. Marconi’s, the\r\ndistinguishing feature being that the ether of the atmosphere is used\r\nin the latter case, that of the earth in the former. The intensity\r\ncoils are common to both; the buried screens are the counterpart of\r\nthe aërial kites or balloons; the telephone transmitter corresponds to\r\nthe telegraphic transmitting key; the earpiece to the coherer and\r\nrelay. No doubt in time Mr. Collins will “tune” his instruments, so\r\nobtaining below ground the same sympathetic electric vibrations which\r\nMr. Marconi, Professor Lodge, or others have employed to clothe their\r\naërial messages in secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHONOGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if Thomas Edison had not done wonders with electric lighting,\r\ntelephones, electric torpedoes, new processes for separating iron from\r\nits ore, telegraphy, animated photography, and other things too\r\nnumerous to mention, he would still have made for himself an enduring\r\nname as the inventor of the Phonograph. He has fitly been called the\r\n“Wizard of the West” from his genius for conjuring up out of what\r\nwould appear to the multitude most unpromising materials startling\r\nscientific marvels, among which none is more truly wizard-like than\r\nthe instrument that is as receptive of sound as the human ear, and of\r\nillimitable reproducing power. By virtue of its elfishly human\r\ncharacteristic, articulate speech, it occupies, and always will\r\noccupy, a very high position as a mechanical wonder. When listening to\r\na telephone we are aware of the fact that the sounds are immediate\r\nreproductions of a living person’s voice, speaking at the moment and\r\nat a definite distance from us; but the phonographic utterances are\r\nthose of a voice perhaps stilled for ever, and the difference adds\r\nromance to the speaking machine.\r\n\r\nThe Phonograph was born in 1876. As we may imagine, its appearance\r\ncreated a stir. A contributor to the _Times_ wrote in 1877: “Not many\r\nweeks have passed since we were startled by the announcement that we\r\ncould converse audibly with each other, although hundreds of miles\r\napart, by means of so many miles of wire with a little electric magnet\r\nat each end.\r\n\r\n“Another wonder is now promised us--an invention purely mechanical in\r\nits nature, by means of which words spoken by the human voice can be,\r\nso to speak, stored up and reproduced at will over and over again\r\nhundreds, it may be thousands, of times. What will be thought of a\r\npiece of mechanism by means of which a message of any length can be\r\nspoken on to a plate of metal--that plate sent by post to any part of\r\nthe world and the message absolutely respoken in the very voice of the\r\nsender, purely by mechanical agency? What, too, shall be said of a\r\nmere machine, by means of which the old familiar voice of one who is\r\nno longer with us on earth can be heard speaking to us in the very\r\ntones and measure to which our ears were once accustomed?”\r\n\r\nThe first Edison machine was the climax of research in the realm of\r\nsound. As long ago as 1856 a Mr. Leo Scott made an instrument which\r\nreceived the formidable name of Phonautograph, on account of its\r\ncapacity to register mechanically the vibrations set up in the\r\natmosphere by the human voice or by musical instruments. A large metal\r\ncone like the mouth of an ear-trumpet had stretched across its smaller\r\nend a membrane, to which was attached a very delicate tracing-point\r\nworking on the surface of a revolving cylinder covered with blackened\r\npaper. Any sound entering the trumpet agitated the membrane, which in\r\nturn moved the stylus and produced a line on the cylinder\r\ncorresponding to the vibration. Scott’s apparatus could only record.\r\nIt was, so to speak, the first half of the phonograph. Edison, twenty\r\nyears later, added the active half. His machine, as briefly described\r\nin the _Times_, was simple; so very simple that many scientists must\r\nhave wondered how they failed to invent it themselves.\r\n\r\nA metal cylinder grooved with a continuous square-section thread of\r\nmany turns to the inch was mounted horizontally on a long axle cut at\r\none end with a screw-thread of the same “pitch” as that on the\r\ncylinder. The axle, working in upright supports, and furnished with a\r\nheavy flywheel to render the rate of revolution fairly uniform, was\r\nturned by a handle. Over the grooved cylinder was stretched a thin\r\nsheet of tinfoil, and on this rested lightly a steel tracing-point,\r\nmounted at the end of a spring and separated from a vibrating\r\ndiaphragm by a small pad of rubber tubing. A large mouthpiece to\r\nconcentrate sound on to the diaphragm completed the apparatus.\r\n\r\nTo make a record with this machine the cylinder was moved along until\r\nthe tracing-point touched one extremity of the foil. The person\r\nspeaking into the mouthpiece turned the handle to bring a fresh\r\nsurface of foil continuously under the point, which, owing to the\r\nthread on the axle and the groove on the cylinder being of the same\r\npitch, was always over the groove, and burnished the foil down into it\r\nto a greater or less depth according to the strength of the impulses\r\nreceived from the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A unique group of Phonographs. 1. The oldest\r\nphonograph in existence, now in South Kensington Museum. 2. Tinfoil\r\ninstrument. 3. A cheaper form of the same. 4. A “spectacle-form”\r\ngraphophone. 5. An exactly similar instrument, half-size scale. 6. A\r\ndoll fitted with phonograph._]\r\n\r\nThe record being finished, the point was lifted off the foil, the\r\ncylinder turned back to its original position, and the point allowed\r\nto run again over the depressions it had made in the metal sheet. The\r\nlatter now became the active part, imparting to the air by means of\r\nthe diaphragm vibrations similar in duration and quality to those that\r\naffected it when the record was being made.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that the phonograph principle was\r\noriginally employed by Edison as a telephone “relay.” His attention\r\nhad been drawn to the telephone recently produced by Graham Bell, and\r\nto the evil effects of current leakage in long lines. He saw that the\r\namount of current wasted increased out of proportion to the length of\r\nthe lines--even more than in the proportion of the squares of their\r\nlengths--and he hoped that a great saving of current would be effected\r\nif a long line were divided into sections and the sound vibrations\r\nwere passed from one to the other by mechanical means. He used as the\r\nconnecting link between two sections a strip of moistened paper, which\r\na needle, attached to a receiver, indented with minute depressions,\r\nthat handed on the message to another telephone. The phonograph\r\nproper, as a recording machine, was an after-thought.\r\n\r\nEdison’s first apparatus, besides being heavy and clumsy, had in\r\npractice faults which made it fall short of the description given in\r\nthe _Times_. Its tone was harsh. The records, so far from enduring a\r\nthousand repetitions, were worn out by a dozen. To these defects must\r\nbe added a considerable difficulty in adjusting a record made on one\r\nmachine to the cylinder of another machine.\r\n\r\nEdison, being busy with his telephone and electric lamp work, put\r\naside the phonograph for a time. Graham Bell, his brother, Chichester\r\nBell, and Charles Sumner Tainter, developed and improved his crude\r\nideas. They introduced the Graphophone, using easily removable\r\ncylinder records. For the tinfoil was substituted a thin coating of a\r\nspecial wax preparation on light paper cylinders. Clockwork-driven\r\nmotors replaced the hand motion, and the new machines were altogether\r\nmore handy and effective. As soon as he had time Edison again entered\r\nthe field. He conceived the solid wax cylinder, and patented a small\r\nshaving apparatus by means of which a record could be pared away and a\r\nfresh surface be presented for a new record.\r\n\r\nThe phonograph or graphophone of to-day is a familiar enough sight;\r\nbut inasmuch as our readers may be less intimately acquainted with its\r\nconstruction and action than with its effects, a few words will now be\r\nadded about its most striking features.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the record remains stationary while the trumpet,\r\ndiaphragm and stylus pass over it. The reverse was the case with the\r\ntinfoil instrument.\r\n\r\nThe record is cut by means of a tiny sapphire point having a circular\r\nconcave end very sharp at the edges, to gouge minute depressions into\r\nthe wax. The point is agitated by a delicate combination of weights\r\nand levers connecting it with a diaphragm of French glass 1/140 inch\r\nthick. The reproducing point is a sapphire ball of a diameter equal to\r\nthat of the gouge. It passes over the depressions, falling into them\r\nin turn and communicating its movements to a diaphragm, and so\r\ntenderly does it treat the records that a hundred repetitions do not\r\ninflict noticeable damage.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious instance of the manner in which man unconsciously\r\ncopies nature that the parts of the reproducing attachment of a\r\nphonograph contains parts corresponding in function exactly to those\r\nbones of the ear known as the Hammer, Anvil, and Stirrup.\r\n\r\nTo understand the inner working of the phonograph the reader must be\r\nacquainted with the theory of sound. All sound is the result of\r\nimpulses transmitted by a moving body usually reaching the ear through\r\nthe medium of the air. The quantity of the sound, or loudness, depends\r\non the violence of the impulse; the tone, or note, on the number of\r\nimpulses in a given time (usually fixed as one second); and the\r\nquality, or _timbre_, as musicians say, on the existence of minor\r\nvibrations within the main ones.\r\n\r\nIf we were to examine the surface of a phonograph record (or\r\nphonogram) under a powerful magnifying glass we should see a series\r\nof scoops cut by the gouge in the wax, some longer and deeper than\r\nothers, long and short, deep and shallow, alternating and recurring in\r\nregular groups. The depth, length, and grouping of the cuts decides\r\nthe nature of the resultant note when the reproducing sapphire point\r\npasses over the record--at a rate of about ten inches a second.\r\n\r\nThe study of a tracing made on properly prepared paper by a point\r\nagitated by a diaphragm would enable us to understand easily the cause\r\nof that mysterious variation in _timbre_ which betrays at once what\r\nkind of instrument has emitted a note of known pitch. For instance,\r\nlet us take middle C, which is the result of a certain number of\r\natmospheric blows per second on the drum of the ear. The same note may\r\ncome from a piano, a violin, a banjo, a man’s larynx, an organ, or a\r\ncornet; but we at once detect its source. It is scarcely imaginable\r\nthat a piano and a cornet should be mistaken for one another. Now, if\r\nthe tracing instrument had been at work while the notes were made\r\nsuccessively it would have recorded a wavy line, each wave of exactly\r\nthe same _length_ as its fellows, but varying in its _outline_\r\naccording to the character of the note’s origin. We should notice that\r\nthe waves were themselves wavy in section, being jagged like the teeth\r\nof a saw, and that the small secondary waves differed in size.\r\n\r\nThe minor waves are the harmonics of the main note. Some musical\r\ninstruments are richer in these harmonics than others. The fact that\r\nthese delicate variations are recorded as minute indentations in the\r\nwax and reproduced is a striking proof of the phonograph’s mechanical\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the phonograph registers not only these composite notes,\r\nbut also chords or simultaneous combinations of notes, each of which\r\nmay proceed from a different instrument. In its action it here\r\nresembles a man who by constant practice is able to add up the pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence columns in his ledger at the same time, one wave\r\nsystem overlapping and blending with another.\r\n\r\nThe phonograph is not equally sympathetic with all classes of sounds.\r\nBanjo duets make good records, but the guitar gives a poor result.\r\nSimilarly, the cornet is peculiarly effective, but the bass drum\r\ndisappointing. The deep chest notes of a man come from the trumpet\r\nwith startling truth, but the top notes on which the soprano prides\r\nherself are often sadly “tinny.” The phonograph, therefore, even in\r\nits most perfect form is not the equal of the exquisitely sensitive\r\nhuman ear; and this may partially be accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe diaphragm in both recorder and reproducer has its own fundamental\r\nnote which is not in harmony with all other notes, whereas the ear,\r\nlike the eye, adapts itself to any vibration.\r\n\r\nYet the phonograph has an almost limitless répertoire. It can justly\r\nbe claimed for it that it is many musical instruments rolled into one.\r\nIt will reproduce clearly and faithfully an orchestra, an\r\ninstrumental soloist, the words of a singer, a stump orator, or a\r\nstage favourite. Consequently we find it every where--at\r\nentertainments, in the drawing-room, and even tempting us at the\r\nrailway station or other places of public resort to part with our\r\nsuperfluous pence. At the London Hippodrome it discourses to audiences\r\nof several thousand persons, and in the nursery it delights the\r\npossessors of ingeniously-constructed dolls which, on a button being\r\npressed and concealed machinery being brought into action, repeat some\r\nwell-known childish melody.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the phonograph is nothing more than a\r\nsuperior kind of scientific toy. More serious duties than those of\r\nmere entertainment have been found for it.\r\n\r\nAt the last Presidential Election in the States the phonograph was\r\noften called upon to harangue large meetings in the interests of the\r\nrival candidates, who were perhaps at the time wearing out their\r\nvoices hundreds of miles away with the same words.\r\n\r\nSince the pronunciation of a foreign language is acquired by constant\r\nimitation of sounds, the phonograph, instructed by an expert, has been\r\nused to repeat words and phrases to a class of students until the\r\ndifficulties they contain have been thoroughly mastered. The sight of\r\nsuch a class hanging on the lips--or more properly the trumpet--of a\r\nphonograph gifted with the true Parisian accent may be common enough\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nAs a mechanical secretary and substitute for the shorthand writer the\r\nphonograph has certainly passed the experimental stage. Its daily use\r\nby some of the largest business establishments in the world testify to\r\nits value in commercial life. Many firms, especially American, have\r\ninvested heavily in establishing phonograph establishments to save\r\nlabour and final expense. The manager, on arriving at his office in\r\nthe morning, reads his letters, and as the contents of each is\r\nmastered, dictates an answer to a phonograph cylinder which is\r\npresently removed to the typewriting room, where an assistant, placing\r\nit upon her phonograph and fixing the tubes to her ears, types what is\r\nrequired. It is interesting to learn that at Ottawa, the seat of the\r\nCanadian Government, phonographs are used for reporting the\r\nparliamentary proceedings and debates.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore a prospect that, though the talking-machine may\r\nlose its novelty as an entertainer, its practical usefulness will be\r\nlargely increased. And while considering the future of the instrument,\r\nthe thought suggests itself whether we shall be taking full advantage\r\nof Mr. Edison’s notable invention if we neglect to make records of all\r\nkinds of intelligible sounds which have more than a passing interest.\r\nIf the records were made in an imperishable substance they might\r\nremain effective for centuries, due care being taken of them in\r\nspecial depositories owned by the nation. To understand what their\r\nvalue would be to future generations we have only to imagine ourselves\r\nlistening to the long-stilled thunder of Earl Chatham, to the golden\r\neloquence of Burke, or the passionate declamations of Mrs. Siddons.\r\nAnd in the narrower circle of family interests how valuable a part of\r\nfamily heirlooms would be the phonograms containing a vocal message to\r\nposterity from Grandfather this, or Great-aunt that, whose portraits\r\nin the drawing-room album do little more than call attention to the\r\nchanges in dress since the time when their subjects faced the camera!\r\n\r\n_Record-Making and Manufacture._--Phonographic records are of two\r\nshapes, the cylindrical and the flat, the latter cut with a volute\r\ngroove continuously diminishing in diameter from the circumference to\r\nthe centre. Flat records are used in the Gramophone--a reproducing\r\nmachine only. Their manufacture is effected by first of all making a\r\nrecord on a sheet of zinc coated with a very thin film of wax, from\r\nwhich the sharp steel point moved by the recording diaphragm removes\r\nsmall portions, baring the zinc underneath. The plate is then flooded\r\nwith an acid solution, which eats into the bared patches, but does not\r\naffect the parts still covered with wax. The etching complete, the wax\r\nis removed entirely, and a cast or electrotype _negative_ record made\r\nfrom the zinc plate. The indentations of the original are in this\r\nrepresented by excrescences of like size; and when the negative block\r\nis pressed hard down on to a properly prepared disc of vulcanite or\r\ncelluloid, the latter is indented in a manner that reproduces exactly\r\nthe tones received on the “master” record.\r\n\r\nCylindrical records are made in two ways, by moulding or by copying.\r\nThe second process is extremely simple. The “master” cylinder is\r\nplaced on a machine which also rotates a blank cylinder at a short\r\ndistance from and parallel to the first. Over the “master” record\r\npasses a reproducing point, which is connected by delicate levers to a\r\ncutting point resting on the “blank,” so that every movement of the\r\none produces a corresponding movement of the other.\r\n\r\nThis method, though accurate in its results, is comparatively slow.\r\nThe _moulding_ process is therefore becoming the more general of the\r\ntwo. Edison has recently introduced a most beautiful process for\r\nobtaining negative moulds from wax positives. Owing to its shape, a\r\nzinc cylinder could not be treated like a flat disc, as, the negative\r\nmade, it could not be detached without cutting. Edison, therefore,\r\nwith characteristic perseverance, sought a way of electrotyping the\r\nwax, which, being a non-conductor of electricity, would not receive a\r\ndeposit of metal. The problem was how to deposit on it.\r\n\r\nAny one who has seen a Crookes’ tube such as is used for X-ray work\r\nmay have noticed on the glass a black deposit which arises from the\r\nflinging off from the negative pole of minute particles of platinum.\r\nEdison took advantage of this repellent action; and by enclosing his\r\nwax records in a vacuum between two gold poles was able to coat them\r\nwith an infinitesimally thin skin of pure gold, on which silver or\r\nnickel could be easily deposited. The deposit being sufficiently thick\r\nthe wax was melted out and the surface of the electrotype carefully\r\ncleaned. To make castings it was necessary only to pour in wax, which\r\non cooling would shrink sufficiently to be withdrawn. The delicacy of\r\nthe process may be deduced from the fact that some of the sibilants,\r\nor hissing sounds of the voice, are computed to be represented by\r\ndepressions less than a millionth of an inch in depth, and yet they\r\nare most distinctly reproduced! Cylinder records are made in two\r\nsizes, 2-1/2 and 5 inches in diameter respectively. The larger size\r\ngives the most satisfactory renderings, as the indentations are on a\r\nlarger scale and therefore less worn by the reproducing point. One\r\nhundred turns to the inch is the standard pitch of the thread; but in\r\nsome records the number is doubled.\r\n\r\nPhonographs, Graphophones, and Gramophones are manufactured almost\r\nentirely in America, where large factories, equipped with most perfect\r\nplant and tools, work day and night to cope with the orders that flow\r\nin freely from all sides. One factory alone turns out a thousand\r\nmachines a day, ranging in value from a few shillings to forty pounds\r\neach. Records are made in England on a large scale; and now that the\r\nEdison-Bell firm has introduced the unbreakable celluloid form their\r\nprice will decrease. By means of the Edison electrotyping process a\r\ncustomer can change his record without changing his cylinder. He takes\r\nthe cylinder to the factory, where it is heated, placed in the mould,\r\nand subjected to great pressure which drives the soft celluloid into\r\nthe mould depressions; and behold! in a few moments “Auld Lang Syne”\r\nhas become “Home, Sweet Home,” or whatever air is desired. Thus\r\naltering records is very little more difficult than getting a fresh\r\nbook at the circulating library.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHOPHONE.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is a phonograph working entirely by means of light and\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe flame of an electric lamp is brought under the influence of sound\r\nvibrations which cause its brilliancy to vary at every alteration of\r\npitch or quality.\r\n\r\nThe light of the flame is concentrated through a lens on to a\r\ntravelling photographic sensitive film, which, on development in the\r\nordinary way, is found to be covered with dark and bright stripes\r\nproportionate in tone to the strength of the light at different\r\nmoments. The film is then passed between a lamp and a selenium plate\r\nconnected with an electric circuit and a telephone. The resistance of\r\nthe selenium to the current varies according to the power of the light\r\nthrown upon it. When a dark portion of the film intercepts the light\r\nof the lamp the selenium plate offers high resistance; when the light\r\nfinds its way through a clear part of the film the resistance weakens.\r\nThus the telephone is submitted to a series of changes affecting the\r\n“receiver.” As in the making of the record speech-vibrations affect\r\nlight, and the light affects a sensitive film; so in its reproduction\r\nthe film affects a sensitive selenium plate, giving back to a\r\ntelephone exactly what it received from the sound vibrations.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of Mr. Ruhmer’s method is that from a single film\r\nany number of records can be printed by photography; another, that, as\r\nwith the Telegraphone (see below), the same film passed before a\r\nseries of lamps successively is able to operate a corresponding number\r\nof telephones.\r\n\r\nThe inventor is not content with his success. He hopes to record not\r\nmerely sounds but even pictures by means of light and a selenium\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONOGRAPH.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the phonograph and the telephone separately, we may\r\nbriefly consider one or two ingenious combinations of the two\r\ninstruments. The word Telephonograph signifies an apparatus for\r\nrecording sounds sent from a distance. It takes the place of the human\r\nlistener at the telephone receiver.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a Reading subscriber wishes to converse along the\r\nwires with a friend in London, but that on ringing up his number he\r\ndiscovers that the friend is absent from his home or office. He is\r\nleft with the alternative of either waiting till his friend returns,\r\nwhich may cause a serious loss of time, or of dictating his message, a\r\nslow and laborious process. This with the ordinary telephonic\r\napparatus. But if the London friend be the possessor of a\r\nTelephonograph, the person answering the call-bell can, if desired to\r\ndo so, switch the wires into connection with it and start the\r\nmachinery; and in a very short time the message will be stored up for\r\nreproduction when the absent friend returns.\r\n\r\nThe Telephonograph is the invention of Mr. J. E. O. Kumberg. The\r\nmessage is spoken into the telephone transmitter in the ordinary way,\r\nand the vibrations set up by the voice are caused to act upon a\r\nrecording stylus by the impact of the sound waves at the further end\r\nof the wires. In this manner a phonogram is produced on the wax\r\ncylinder in the house or office of the person addressed, and it may be\r\nread off at leisure. A very sensitive transmitter is employed, and if\r\ndesired the apparatus can be so arranged that by means of a\r\ndouble-channel tube the words spoken are simultaneously conveyed to\r\nthe telephone and to an ordinary phonograph, which insures that a\r\nrecord shall be kept of any message sent.\r\n\r\nThe _Telegraphone_, produced by Mr. Valdemar Poulsen, performs the\r\nsame functions as the telephonograph, but differs from it in being\r\nentirely electrical. It contains no waxen cylinder, no cutting-point;\r\ntheir places are taken respectively by a steel wire wound on a\r\ncylindrical drum (each turn carefully insulated from its neighbours)\r\nand by a very small electro-magnet, which has two delicate points that\r\npass along the wire, one on either side, resting lightly upon it.\r\n\r\nAs the drum rotates, the whole of the wire passes gradually between\r\nthe two points, into which a series of electric shocks is sent by the\r\naction of the speaker’s voice at the further end of the wires. The\r\nshocks magnetise the portion of steel wire which acts as a temporary\r\nbridge between the two points. At the close of three and a half\r\nminutes the magnet has worked from one end of the wire coil to the\r\nother; it is then automatically lifted and carried back to the\r\nstarting-point in readiness for reproduction of the sounds. This is\r\naccomplished by disconnecting the telegraphone from the telephone\r\nwires and switching it on to an ordinary telephonic earpiece or\r\nreceiver. As soon as the cylinder commences to revolve a second time,\r\nthe magnet is influenced by the series of magnetic “fields” in the\r\nwires, and as often as it touches a magnetised spot imparts an impulse\r\nto the diaphragm of the receiver, which vibrates at the rate and with\r\nthe same force as the vibrations originally set up in the distant\r\ntransmitter. The result is a clear and accurate reproduction of the\r\nmessage, even though hours and even days may have elapsed since its\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nAs the magnetic effects on the wire coil retain their power for a\r\nconsiderable period, the message may be reproduced many times. As soon\r\nas the wire-covered drum is required for fresh impressions, the old\r\none is wiped out by passing a permanent magnet along the wire to\r\nneutralise the magnetism of the last message.\r\n\r\nMr. Poulsen has made an instrument of a different type to be employed\r\nfor the reception of an unusually lengthy communication. Instead of a\r\nwire coil on a cylinder, a ribbon of very thin flat steel spring is\r\nwound from one reel on to another across the poles of _two_\r\nelectro-magnets, which touch the lower side only of the strip. The\r\nfirst magnet is traversed by a continuous current to efface the\r\nprevious record; the second magnetises the strip in obedience to\r\nimpulses from the telephone wires. The message complete, the strip is\r\nrun back, and the magnets connected with receivers, which give out\r\nloud and intelligent speech as the strip again traverses them. The\r\nPoulsen machine makes the transmission of the same message\r\nsimultaneously through several telephones an easy matter, as the strip\r\ncan be passed over a series of electro-magnets each connected with a\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELAUTOGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a curious experience to watch for the first time the movements\r\nof a tiny Telautograph pen as it works behind a glass window in a\r\njapanned case. The pen, though connected only with two delicate wires,\r\nappears instinct with human reason. It writes in a flowing hand, just\r\nas a man writes. At the end of a word it crosses the t’s and dots the\r\ni’s. At the end of a line it dips itself in an inkpot. It punctuates\r\nits sentences correctly. It illustrates its words with sketches. It\r\nuses shorthand as readily as longhand. It can form letters of all\r\nshapes and sizes.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is no visible reason why it should do what it does. The\r\njapanned case hides the guiding agency, whatever it may be. Our ears\r\ncannot detect any mechanical motion. The writing seems at first sight\r\nas mysterious as that which appeared on the wall to warn King\r\nBelshazzar.\r\n\r\nIn reality it is the outcome of a vast amount of patience and\r\nmechanical ingenuity culminating in a wonderful instrument called the\r\nTelautograph. The Telautograph is so named because by its aid we can\r\nsend our autographs, _i.e._ our own particular handwriting,\r\nelectrically over an indefinite length of wire, as easily as a\r\ntelegraph clerk transmits messages in the Morse alphabet. Whatever\r\nthe human hand does on one telautograph at one end of the wires, that\r\nwill be reproduced by a similar machine at the other end, though the\r\nlatter be hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Telautograph Co._\r\n\r\n_The Telautograph. The upper portion is the Receiver, the lower (with\r\ncover removed) is the Transmitter._]\r\n\r\nThe instrument stands about eighteen inches high, and its base is as\r\nmany inches square. It falls into two parts, the receiver and the\r\ntransmitter. The receiver is vertical and forms the upright and back\r\nportion of the telautograph. At one side of it hangs an ordinary\r\ntelephone attachment. The transmitter, a sloping desk placed\r\nconveniently for the hand, is the front and horizontal portion. The\r\nreceiver of one station is connected with the transmitter of another\r\nstation; there being ordinarily no direct communication between the\r\ntwo parts of the same instrument.\r\n\r\nAn attempt will be made to explain, with the help of a simple diagram,\r\nthe manner in which the telautograph performs its duties.\r\n\r\nThese duties are threefold. In the first place, it must reproduce\r\nwhatever is written on the transmitter. Secondly, it must reproduce\r\nonly what is _written_, not all the movements of the hand. Thirdly, it\r\nmust supply the recording pen with fresh paper to write on, and with\r\nfresh ink to write with.\r\n\r\nIn our diagram we must imagine that all the coverings of the\r\ntelautograph have been cleared away to lay bare the most essential\r\nparts of the mechanism. For the sake of simplicity not all the coils,\r\nwires, and magnets having functions of their own are represented, and\r\nthe drawing is not to scale. But what is shown will enable the reader\r\nto grasp the general principles which work the machine.\r\n\r\nTurning first of all to the transmitter, we have P, a little platform\r\nhinged at the back end, and moving up and down very slightly in front,\r\naccording as pressure is put on to or taken off it by the pencil.\r\nAcross it a roll of paper is shifted by means of the lever S, which\r\nhas other uses as well. To the right of P is an electric bell-push, E,\r\nand on the left K, another small button.\r\n\r\nThe pencil is at the junction of two small bars CC’, which are hinged\r\nat their other end to the levers AA’. Any motion of the pencil is\r\ntransmitted by CC’ to AA’, and by them to the arms LL’, the\r\nextremities of which, two very small brushes ZZ’, sweep along the\r\nquadrants RR’. This is the first point to observe, that the position\r\nof the pencil decides on which sections of the quadrants these little\r\nbrushes rest, and consequently how much current is to be sent to the\r\ndistant station. The quadrants are known technically as rheostats, or\r\ncurrent-controllers. Each quadrant is divided into 496 parts,\r\nseparated from each other by insulating materials, so that current can\r\npass from one to the other only by means of some connecting wire. In\r\nour illustration only thirteen divisions are given, for the sake of\r\nclearness. The dark lines represent the insulation. WW’ are the very\r\nfine wire loops connecting each division of the quadrant with its\r\nneighbours. If then a current from the battery B enters the rheostat\r\nat division 1 it will have to pass through all these wires before it\r\ncan reach division 13. The current always enters at 1, but the point\r\nof departure from the rheostat depends entirely upon the position of\r\nthe brushes Z or Z’. If Z happens to be on No. 6 the current will pass\r\nthrough five loops of wire, along the arm L, and so through the main\r\nwire to the receiving station; if on No. 13, through twelve loops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TELAUTOGRAPH]\r\n\r\nBefore going any further we must have clear ideas on the subject of\r\nelectrical resistance, upon which the whole system of the telautograph\r\nis built up. Electricity resembles water in its objection to flow\r\nthrough small passages. It is much harder to pump water through a\r\nhalf-inch pipe than through a one-inch pipe, and the longer the pipe\r\nis, whatever its bore, the more work is required. So then, two things\r\naffect resistance--_size_ of pipe or wire, and _length_ of pipe or\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nThe wires WW’ are very fine, and offer very high resistance to a\r\ncurrent; so high that by the time the current from battery B has\r\npassed through all the wire loops only one-fifteenth or less of the\r\noriginal force is left to traverse the long-distance wire.\r\n\r\nThe rheostats act independently of one another. As the pencil moves\r\nover the transmitting paper, a succession of currents of varying\r\nintensity is sent off by each rheostat to the receiving station.\r\n\r\nThe receiver, to which we must now pay attention, has two arms DD’,\r\nand two rods FF’, corresponding in size with AA’ and CC’ of the\r\ntransmitter. The arms DD’ are moved up and down by the coils TT’ which\r\nturn on centres in circular spaces at the bend of the magnets MM’. The\r\nposition of these coils relatively to the magnets depend on the\r\nstrength of the currents coming from the transmitting station. Each\r\ncoil strains at a small spiral spring until it has reached the\r\nposition in which its electric force is balanced by the retarding\r\ninfluence of the spring. One of the cleverest things in the\r\ntelautograph is the adjustment of these coils so that they shall\r\nfollow faithfully the motions of the rods LL’ in the transmitter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of_] [_The Telautograph Co._\r\n\r\n_An example of the work done by the Telautograph. The upper sketch\r\nshows a design drawn on the transmitter; the lower is the same design\r\nas reproduced by the receiving instrument, many miles distant._]\r\n\r\nWe are now able to trace the actions of sending a message. The sender\r\nfirst presses the button E to call the attention of some one at the\r\nreceiving station to the fact that a message is coming, either on the\r\ntelephone or on the paper. It should be remarked, by-the-bye, that the\r\nsame wires serve for both telephone and telautograph, the unhooking of\r\nthe telephone throwing the telautograph out of connection for the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHe then presses the lever S towards the left, bringing his transmitter\r\ninto connection with the distant receiver, and also moving a fresh\r\nlength of paper on to the platform P. With his pencil he writes his\r\nmessage, pressing firmly on the paper, so that the platform may bear\r\ndown against an electric contact, X. As the pencil moves about the\r\npaper the arms CC’ are constantly changing their angles, and the\r\nbrushes ZZ’ are passing along the segments of the rheostats.\r\n\r\nCurrents flow in varying intensity away to the coils TT’ and work the\r\narms DD’, the wires FF’, and the pen, a tiny glass tube.\r\n\r\nIn the perfectly regulated telautograph the arms AA’ and the arms DD’\r\nwill move in unison, and consequently the position of the pen must be\r\nthe same from moment to moment as that of the pencil.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster Ritchie, the clever inventor of this telautograph, had to\r\nprovide for many things besides mere slavish imitation of movement. As\r\nhas been stated above, the pen must record only those movements of the\r\npencil which are essential. Evidently, if while the pencil returns to\r\ndot an _i_ a long line were registered by the pen corresponding to the\r\npath of the pencil, confusion would soon ensue on the receiver; and\r\ninstead of a neatly-written message we should have an illegible and\r\npuzzling maze of lines. Mr. Ritchie has therefore taken ingenious\r\nprecautions against any such mishap. The platen P on being depressed\r\nby the pencil touches a contact, X, which closes an electric circuit\r\nthrough the long-distance wires and excites a magnet at the receiving\r\nend. That attracts a little arm and breaks another circuit, allowing\r\nthe bar Y to fall close to the paper. The wires FF’ and the pen are\r\nnow able to rest on the paper and trace characters. But as soon as the\r\nplaten P rises, on the removal of the pencil from the transmitting\r\npaper, the contact at X is broken, the magnet at the receiver ceases\r\nto act, the arm it attracted falls back and sets up a circuit which\r\ncauses the bar to spring up again and lift the pen. So that unless\r\nyou are actually pressing the paper with your pencil, the pen is not\r\nmarking, though it may be moving.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a line is finished a fresh surface of paper is required at\r\nboth ends. The operator pushes the lever S sideways, and effects the\r\nchange mechanically at his end. At the same time a circuit is formed\r\nwhich excites certain magnets at the receiver and causes the shifting\r\nforward there also of the paper, and also breaks the _writing_\r\ncurrent, so that the pen returns for a moment to its normal position\r\nof rest in the inkpot.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked: If the wires are passing currents to work the writing\r\napparatus, how can they simultaneously affect the lifting-bar, Y? The\r\nanswer is that currents of two different kinds are used, a direct\r\ncurrent for writing, a vibratory current for depressing the\r\nlifting-bar. The _direct_ current passes from the battery B through\r\nthe rheostats RR’ along the wires, through the coils working the arms\r\nDD’ and into the earth at the far end; but the _vibratory_ current,\r\nchanging its direction many times a second and so neutralising itself,\r\npasses up one wire and back down the other through the lifting-bar\r\nconnection without interfering with the direct current.\r\n\r\nThe message finished, the operator depresses with the point of his\r\npencil the little push-key, K, and connects his receiver with the\r\ndistant transmitter in readiness for an answer.\r\n\r\nThe working speed of the telautograph is that of the writer. If\r\nshorthand be employed, messages can be transmitted at the rate of over\r\n100 words per minute. As regards the range of transmission, successful\r\ntests have been made by the postal authorities between Paris and\r\nLondon, and also between Paris and Lyons. In the latter case the\r\nmessages were sent from Paris to Lyons and back directly to Paris, the\r\nlines being connected at Lyons, to give a total distance of over 650\r\nmiles. There is no reason why much greater length of line should not\r\nbe employed.\r\n\r\nThe telautograph in its earlier and imperfect form was the work of\r\nProfessor Elisha Gray, who invented the telephone almost\r\nsimultaneously with Professor Graham Bell. His telautograph worked on\r\nwhat is known as the step-by-step principle, and was defective in that\r\nits speed was very limited. If the operator wrote too fast the\r\nreceiving pen lagged behind the transmitting pencil, and confusion\r\nresulted. Accordingly this method, though ingenious, was abandoned,\r\nand Mr. Ritchie in his experiments looked about for some preferable\r\nsystem, which should be simpler and at the same time much speedier in\r\nits action. After four years of hard work he has brought the rheostat\r\nsystem, explained above, to a pitch of perfection which will be at\r\nonce appreciated by any one who has seen the writing done by the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Telautograph over the ordinary telegraphy may be\r\nbriefly summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\nAnybody who can write can use it; the need of skilled operators is\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nA record is automatically kept of every message sent.\r\n\r\nThe person to whom the message is sent need not be present at the\r\nreceiver. He will find the message written out on his return.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is silent and so insures secrecy. An ordinary telegraph\r\nmay be read by sound; but not the telautograph.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tap the wires unless, as is most unlikely, the\r\nintercepting party has an instrument in exact accord with the\r\ntransmitter.\r\n\r\nIt can be used on the same wires as the ordinary telephone, and since\r\na telephone is combined with it, the subscriber has a double means of\r\ncommunication. For some items of business the telephone may be used as\r\npreferable; but in certain cases, the telautograph. A telephone\r\nmessage may be heard by other subscribers; it is impossible to prove\r\nthe authenticity of such a message unless witnesses have been present\r\nat the transmitting end; and the message itself may be misunderstood\r\nby reason of bad articulation. But the telautograph preserves secrecy\r\nwhile preventing any misunderstanding. Anything written by it is for\r\nall practical purposes as valid as a letter.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget its extreme usefulness for transmitting sketches. A\r\nvery simple diagram often explains a thing better than pages of\r\nletter-press. The telautograph may help in the detection of criminals,\r\na pictorial presentment of whom can by its means be despatched all\r\nover the country in a very short time. And in warfare an instrument\r\nflashing back from the advance-guard plans of the country and of the\r\nenemy’s positions might on occasion prove of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vast subject of artillery in its modern form, including under this\r\nhead for convenience’ sake not only heavy ordnance but machine-guns\r\nand small-arms, can of necessity only be dealt with most briefly in\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be well to take a general survey and to define\r\nbeforehand any words or phrases which are used technically in\r\ndescribing the various operations.\r\n\r\nThe employment of firearms dates from a long-distant past, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that many an improvement introduced during the\r\nlast century is but the revival of a former invention which only lack\r\nof accuracy in tools and appliances had hitherto prevented from being\r\nbrought into practical usage.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1498 the art of _rifling_ cannon in straight grooves\r\nwas known, and a British patent was taken out in 1635 by Rotsipan. The\r\ngrooves were first made spiral or screwed by Koster of Birmingham\r\nabout 1620. Berlin possesses a rifled cannon with thirteen grooves\r\ndated 1664. But the first recorded uses of such weapons in actual\r\nwarfare was during Louis Napoleon’s Italian campaign in 1859, and two\r\nyears later by General James of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nThe system of _breech-loading_, again, is as old as the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and we find a British patent of 1741; while the first United\r\nStates patent was given in 1811 for a flint-lock weapon.\r\n\r\n_Magazine_ guns of American production appeared in 1849 and 1860, but\r\nthese were really an adaptation of the old matchlock revolvers, said\r\nto belong to the period 1480-1500. There is one in the Tower of London\r\ncredited to the fifteenth century, and a British patent of 1718\r\ndescribes a well-constructed revolver carried on a tripod and of the\r\ndimensions of a modern machine-gun. The inventor gravely explains that\r\nhe has provided round chambers for round bullets to shoot Christians,\r\nand square chambers with square missiles for use against the Turks!\r\n\r\nThe word “ordnance” is applied to heavy guns of all kinds, and\r\nincludes guns mounted on fortresses, naval guns, siege artillery, and\r\nthat for use in the field. These guns are all mounted on stands or\r\ncarriages, and may be divided into three classes:--\r\n\r\n     (i.) _Cannon_, or heavy guns.\r\n\r\n     (ii.) _Howitzers_, for field, mountain, or siege use, which are\r\n     lighter and shorter than cannon, and designed to throw hollow\r\n     projectiles with comparatively small charges.\r\n\r\n     (iii.) _Mortars_, for throwing shells at a great elevation.\r\n\r\nThe modern long-range guns and improved howitzers have, however,\r\nvirtually superseded mortars. _Machine-guns_ of various forms are\r\ncomparatively small and light, transportable by hand, and filling a\r\nplace between cannon and small-arms, the latter term embracing the\r\nsoldier’s personal armament of rifle and pistol or revolver, which are\r\ncarried in the hand.\r\n\r\nA group of guns of the like design are generally given the name of\r\ntheir first inventor, or the place of manufacture: such as the\r\nArmstrong gun, the Vickers-Maxim, the Martini-Henry rifle, or the\r\nEnfield.\r\n\r\nThe indifferent use of several expressions in describing the same\r\nweapon is, however, rather confusing. One particular gun may be thus\r\nreferred to:--by its _weight_ in tons or cwt., as “the 35-ton gun”; by\r\nthe weight of its _projectile_, as “a 68-pounder”; by its _calibre_,\r\nthat is, size of bore, as “the 4-inch gun.” Of these the heavier\r\nbreech-loading (B.-L.) and quick-firing (Q.-F.) guns are generally\r\nknown by the size of bore; small Q.-F.’s, field-guns, &c., by the\r\nweight of projectile. It is therefore desirable to enter these\r\nparticulars together when making any list of service ordnance for\r\nfuture reference.\r\n\r\nNo individual gun, whether large or small, is a single whole, but\r\nconsists of several pieces fastened together by many clever devices.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of a cannon are:--\r\n\r\n     (1) The _chase_, or main tube into which the projectile is\r\n     loaded; terminating at one end in the muzzle.\r\n\r\n     (2) The _breech-piece_, consisting of (_a_) the chamber, which\r\n     is bored out for a larger diameter than the chase to contain\r\n     the firing-charge. (_b_) The _breech-plug_, which is closed\r\n     before the charge is exploded and screwed tightly into place,\r\n     sealing every aperture by means of a special device called the\r\n     “obturator,” in order to prevent any gases passing out round it\r\n     instead of helping to force the projectile forwards towards the\r\n     muzzle.\r\n\r\nThe whole length of inside tube is termed the _barrel_, as in a\r\nmachine-gun, rifle, or sporting-piece, but in the two latter weapons\r\nthe breech-opening is closed by sliding or springing back the\r\nbreech-block or bolt into firing position.\r\n\r\nOld weapons as a rule were smooth-bored (S.-B.), firing a round\r\nmissile between which and the barrel a considerable amount of the\r\ngases generated by the explosion escaped and caused loss of power,\r\nthis escape of gas being known as _windage_.\r\n\r\nIn all modern weapons we use conical projectiles, fitted near the base\r\nwith a soft copper driving-band, the diameter of which is somewhat\r\nlarger than that of the bore of the gun, and cut a number of spiral\r\ngrooves in the barrel. The enormous pressure generated by the\r\nexplosion of the charge forces the projectile down the bore of the gun\r\nand out of the muzzle. The body of the projectile, made of steel or\r\niron, being smaller in diameter than the bore, easily passes through,\r\nbut the driving-band being of greater diameter, and being composed of\r\nsoft copper, can only pass down the bore with the projectile by\r\nflowing into the grooves, thus preventing any escape of gas, and being\r\nforced to follow their twist. It therefore rotates rapidly upon its\r\nown longitudinal axis while passing down the barrel, and on leaving\r\nthe muzzle two kinds of velocity have been imparted to it;--first, a\r\nvelocity of motion through the air; secondly, a velocity of rotation\r\nround its axis which causes it to fly steadily onward in the required\r\ndirection, _i.e._ a prolongation of the axis of the gun. Thus extreme\r\nvelocity and penetrating power, as well as correctness of aim, are\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nThe path of a projectile through the air is called its _trajectory_,\r\nand if uninterrupted its flight would continue on indefinitely in a\r\nperfectly straight line. But immediately a shot has been hurled from\r\nthe gun by the explosion in its rear two other natural forces begin to\r\nact upon it:--\r\n\r\nGravitation, which tends to bring it to earth.\r\n\r\nAir-resistance, which gradually checks its speed.\r\n\r\n(Theoretically, a bullet dropped perpendicularly from the muzzle of a\r\nperfectly horizontal rifle would reach the ground at the same moment\r\nas another bullet fired from the muzzle horizontally, the action of\r\ngravity being the same in both cases.)\r\n\r\nIts direct, even course is therefore deflected till it forms a curve,\r\nand sooner or later it returns to earth, still retaining a part of its\r\nvelocity. To counteract the attraction of gravity the shot is thrown\r\nupwards by elevating the muzzle, care being taken to direct the gun’s\r\naction to the same height above the object as the force of gravitation\r\nwould draw the projectile down during the time of flight. The gunner\r\nis enabled to give the proper inclination to his piece by means of the\r\n_sights_; one of these, near the muzzle, being generally fixed, while\r\nthat next the breech is adjustable by sliding up an upright bar which\r\nis so graduated that the proper _elevation_ for any required range is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe greater the velocity the flatter is the trajectory, and the more\r\ndangerous to the enemy. Assuming the average height of a man to be six\r\nfeet, all the distance intervening between the point where a bullet\r\nhas dropped to within six feet of the earth, and the point where it\r\nactually strikes is dangerous to any one in that interval, which is\r\ncalled the “danger zone.” A higher initial velocity is gained by using\r\nstronger firing charges, and a more extended flight by making the\r\nprojectile longer in proportion to its diameter. The reason why a\r\nshell from a cannon travels further than a rifle bullet, both having\r\nthe same muzzle velocity, is easily explained.\r\n\r\nA rifle bullet is, let us assume, three times as long as it is thick;\r\na cannon shell the same. If the shell have ten times the diameter of\r\nthe bullet, its “nose” will have 10 × 10 = 100 times the area of the\r\nbullet’s nose; but its _mass_ will be 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000 times that of\r\nthe bullet.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when two bodies are proportional in all their\r\ndimensions their air-resistance varies as the square of their\r\ndiameters, but their mass and consequently their momentum varies as\r\nthe _cube_ of their diameters. The shell therefore starts with a great\r\nadvantage over the bullet, and may be compared to a “crew” of cyclists\r\non a multicycle all cutting the same path through the air; whereas the\r\nbullet resembles a single rider, who has to overcome as much\r\nair-resistance as the front man of the “crew” but has not the weight\r\nof other riders behind to help him.\r\n\r\nAs regards the effect of rifling, it is to keep the bullet from\r\nturning head over heels as it flies through the air, and to maintain\r\nit always point forwards. Every boy knows that a top “sleeps” best\r\nwhen it is spinning fast. Its horizontal rotation overcomes a tendency\r\nto vertical movement towards the ground. In like manner a rifle\r\nbullet, spinning vertically, overcomes an inclination of its atoms to\r\nmove out of their horizontal path. Professor John Perry, F.R.S., has\r\nillustrated this gyroscopic effect, as it is called, of a whirling\r\nbody with a heavy flywheel in a case, held by a man standing on a\r\npivoted table. However much the man may try to turn the top from its\r\noriginal direction he will fail as long as its velocity of rotation is\r\nhigh. He may move the top relatively to his body, but the table will\r\nturn so as to keep the centre line of the top always pointing in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIFLES.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of last century our soldiers were armed with the\r\nflint-lock musket known as “Brown Bess,” a smooth-bore barrel 3/4-inch\r\nin diameter, thirty-nine inches long, weighing with its bayonet over\r\neleven pounds. The round leaden bullet weighed an ounce, and had to be\r\nwrapped in a “patch” or bit of oily rag to make it fit the barrel and\r\nprevent windage; it was then pushed home with a ramrod on to the\r\npowder-charge, which was ignited by a spark passing from the flint\r\ninto a priming of powder. How little its accuracy of aim could be\r\ndepended upon, however, is proved by the word of command when\r\nadvancing upon an enemy, “Wait till you see the whites of their eyes,\r\nboys, before you fire!”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1680 each troop of Life Guards was supplied with eight\r\nrifled carbines, a modest allowance, possibly intended to be used\r\nmerely by those acting as scouts. After this we hear nothing of them\r\nuntil in 1800 the 95th Regiment received a 20-bore muzzle-loading\r\nrifle, exchanged about 1835 for the Brunswick rifle firing a spherical\r\nbullet, an improvement that more than doubled its effective range. The\r\ncompanies so armed became known as the Rifle Brigade. At last, in\r\n1842, the old flint-lock was superseded for the whole army by the\r\noriginal percussion musket, a smooth-bore whose charge was exploded by\r\na percussion cap made of copper. [That this copper had some commercial\r\nvalue was shown by the rush of “roughs” to Aldershot and elsewhere\r\nupon a field-day to collect the split fragments which strewed the\r\nground after the troops had withdrawn.]\r\n\r\nSoon afterward the barrel was rifled and an elongated bullet brought\r\ninto use. This missile was pointed in front, and had a hollowed base\r\nso contrived that it expanded immediately the pressure of exploding\r\ngases was brought to bear on it, and thus filled up the grooves,\r\npreventing any windage. The one adopted by our army in the year 1852\r\nwas the production of M. Minié, a Frenchman, though an expanding\r\nbullet of English invention had been brought forward several years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Prussians had their famous needle-gun, a breech-loading\r\nrifled weapon fired by a needle attached to a sliding bolt; as the\r\nbolt is shot forward the needle pierces the charge and ignites the\r\nfulminate by friction. This rifle was used in the Prusso-Austrian war\r\nof 1866 some twenty years after its first inception, and the French\r\npromptly countered it by arming their troops with the Chassepôt rifle,\r\nan improved edition of the same principle. A piece which could be\r\ncharged and fired in any position from five to seven times as fast as\r\nthe muzzle-loader, which the soldier had to load standing, naturally\r\ncaused a revolution in the infantry armament of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe English Government, as usual the last to make a change, decided in\r\n1864 upon using breech-loading rifles. Till a more perfect weapon\r\ncould be obtained the Enfields were at a small outlay converted into\r\nbreech-loaders after the plans of Mr. Snider, and were henceforward\r\nknown as Snider-Enfields. Eventually--as the result of open\r\ncompetition--the Martini-Henry rifle was produced by combining Henry’s\r\nsystem of rifling with Martini’s mechanism for breech-loading. This\r\nweapon had seven grooves with one turn in twenty-two inches, and\r\nweighed with bayonet 10 lb. 4 oz. It fired with great accuracy, the\r\ntrajectory having a rise of only eight feet at considerable distances,\r\nso that the bullet would not pass over the head of a cavalry man.\r\nTwenty rounds could be fired in fifty-three seconds.\r\n\r\nNow in the latter years of the century all these weapons have been\r\nsuperseded by magazine rifles, _i.e._ rifles which can be fired\r\nseveral times without recourse to the ammunition pouch. They differ\r\nfrom the revolver in having only one firing chamber, into which the\r\ncartridges are one by one brought by a simple action of the breech\r\nmechanism, which also extracts the empty cartridge-case. The bore of\r\nthese rifles is smaller and the rifling sharper; they therefore shoot\r\nstraighter and harder than the large bore, and owing to the use of new\r\nexplosives the recoil is less.\r\n\r\nThe French _Lebel_ magazine rifle was the pioneer of all now used by\r\nEuropean nations, though a somewhat similar weapon was familiar to the\r\nAmericans since 1849, being first used during the Civil War. The Henry\r\nrifle, as it was called, afterwards became the Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe German army rifle is the _Mauser_, so familiar to us in the hands\r\nof the Boers during the South African War--loading five cartridges at\r\nonce in a case or “clip” which falls out when emptied. The same rifle\r\nhas been adopted by Turkey, and was used by the Spaniards in the late\r\nSpanish-American War.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian _Mannlicher_, adopted by several continental nations, and\r\nthe Krag-Jorgensen now used in the north of Europe and as the United\r\nStates army weapon, resemble the Mauser in most particulars. Each of\r\nthese loads the magazine in one movement with a clip.\r\n\r\nThe _Hotchkiss_ magazine rifle has its magazine in the stock, holding\r\nfive extra cartridges pushed successively into loading position by a\r\nspiral spring.\r\n\r\nOur forces are now armed principally with the _Lee-Enfield_, which is\r\ntaking the place of the _Lee-Metford_ issued a few years ago. These\r\nare small-bore rifles of .303 inch calibre, having a detachable box,\r\nwhich is loaded with ten cartridges (Lee-Metford eight) passed up in\r\nturn by a spring into the breech, whence, when the bolt is closed,\r\nthey are pushed into the firing-chamber. The empty case is ejected by\r\npulling back the bolt, and at the same time another cartridge is\r\npressed up from the magazine and the whole process repeated. When the\r\ncut-off is used the rifle may be loaded and fired singly, be the\r\nmagazine full or empty.\r\n\r\nThe Lee-Enfield has five grooves (Lee-Metford ten), making one\r\ncomplete turn from right to left in every ten inches. It weighs 9 lb.\r\n4 oz., and the barrel is 30.197 inches long. The range averages 3500\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nWe are now falling into line with other powers by adopting the “clip”\r\nform instead of the box for loading. The sealed pattern of the new\r\nservice weapon is thus provided, and has also been made somewhat\r\nlighter and shorter while preserving the same velocity.\r\n\r\nWe are promised an even more rapid firing rifle than any of these, one\r\nin which the recoil is used to work the breech and lock so that it is\r\na veritable automatic gun. Indeed, several continental nations have\r\nmade trial of such weapons and reported favourably upon them. One\r\nlately tried in Italy works by means of gas generated by the explosion\r\npassing through a small hole to move a piston-rod. It is claimed that\r\nthe magazine can hold as many as fifty cartridges and fire up to\r\nthirty rounds a minute; but the barrel became so hot after doing this\r\nthat the trial had to be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe principal result of automatic action would probably be excessive\r\nwaste of cartridges by wild firing in the excitement of an engagement.\r\nIt is to-day as true as formerly that it takes on the average a man’s\r\nweight of lead to kill him in battle.\r\n\r\nTo our neighbours across the Channel the credit also belongs of\r\nintroducing _smokeless powder_, now universally used; that of the\r\nLee-Metford being “cordite.” To prevent the bullets flattening on\r\nimpact they are coated with a hard metal such as nickel and its\r\nalloys. If the nose is soft, or split beforehand, a terribly enlarged\r\nand lacerated wound is produced; so the Geneva Convention humanely\r\nprohibited the use of such missiles in warfare.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this part of our subject it is as well to add a few\r\nwords about _pistols_.\r\n\r\nThese have passed through much the same process of evolution as the\r\nrifle, and have now culminated in the many-shotted _revolver_.\r\n\r\nDuring the period 1480-1500 the match-lock revolver is said to have\r\nbeen brought into use; and one attributed to this date may be seen in\r\nthe Tower of London.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago, Richards, a London gunsmith, converted the\r\nancient wheel-lock into the flint-lock; he also rifled his barrel and\r\nloaded it at the breech. The Richards weapon was double-barrelled, and\r\nunscrewed for loading at the point where the powder-chamber ended; the\r\nball was placed in this chamber in close contact with the powder, and\r\nthe barrel rescrewed. The bullet being a soft leaden ball, was forced,\r\nwhen the charge was fired, through the rifled barrel with great\r\naccuracy of aim.\r\n\r\nThe percussion cap did not oust the flint-lock till less than a\r\ncentury ago, when many single-barrelled pistols, such as the famous\r\nDerringer, were produced; these in their turn were replaced by the\r\nrevolver which _Colt_ introduced in 1836-1850. Smith and Wesson in the\r\nearly sixties improved upon it by a device for extracting the empty\r\ncartridges automatically. Livermore and Russell of the United States\r\ninvented the “clip,” containing several cartridges; but the equally\r\nwell-known _Winchester_ has its cartridges arranged in a tube below\r\nthe barrel, whence a helical spring feeds them to the breech as fast\r\nas they are needed.\r\n\r\nAt the present time each War Department has its own special service\r\nweapon. The German _Mauser_ magazine-pistol for officer’s use fires\r\nten shots in ten seconds, a slight pressure of the trigger setting the\r\nfull machinery in motion; the pressure of gas at each explosion does\r\nall the rest of the work--extracts and ejects the cartridge case,\r\ncocks the hammer, and presses springs which reload and close the\r\nweapon, all in a fraction of a second. The _Mannlicher_ is of the same\r\nautomatic type, but its barrel moves to the front, leaving space for a\r\nfresh cartridge to come up from the magazine below, while in the\r\nMauser the breech moves to the rear during recoil. The range is half a\r\nmile. The cartridges are made up in sets of ten in a case, which can\r\nbe inserted in one movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE-GUNS.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between hand-borne weapons and artillery, and partaking\r\nof the nature of both, come the machine-guns firing small projectiles\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nSince the United States made trial of Dr. Gatling’s miniature battery\r\nin the Civil War (1862-1865), invention has been busy evolving more\r\nand more perfect types, till the most modern machine-gun is a marvel\r\nof ingenuity and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe _Gatling_ machine-gun, which has been much improved in late years\r\nby the Accles system of “feed,” and is not yet completely out of date,\r\nconsists of a circular series of ten barrels--each with its own\r\nlock--mounted on a central shaft and revolved by a suitable gear. The\r\ncartridges are successively fed by automatic actions into the barrels,\r\nand the hammers are so arranged that the entire operation of loading,\r\nclosing the breech, firing and withdrawing the empty cartridge-cases\r\n(which is known as their “longitudinal reciprocating motion”) is\r\ncarried on while the locks are kept in constant revolution, along with\r\nthe barrels and breech, by means of a hand-crank. One man places a\r\nfeed-case filled with cartridges into the hopper, another turns the\r\ncrank. As the gun is rotated the cartridges drop one by one from the\r\nfeed-cases into the grooves of the carrier, and its lock loads and\r\nfires each in turn. While the gun revolves further the lock, drawing\r\nback, extracts and drops the empty case; it is then ready for the next\r\ncartridge.\r\n\r\nIn action five cartridges are always going through some process of\r\nloading, while five empty shells are in different stages of ejection.\r\nThe latest type, fitted with an electro-motor, will fire at the _rate_\r\nof one thousand rounds per minute, and eighty rounds have actually\r\nbeen fired within ten seconds! It is not, however, safe to work these\r\nmachine-guns so fast, as the cartridges are apt to be occasionally\r\npulled through unfired and then explode among the men’s legs. The\r\nautomatic guns, on the contrary, as they only work by the explosion,\r\nare free from any risk of such accidents.\r\n\r\nThe feed-drums contain 104 cartridges, and can be replaced almost\r\ninstantly. One drumful can be discharged in 5-1/4 seconds. The\r\nsmall-sized Gatling has a drum-feed of 400 cartridges in sixteen\r\nsections of twenty-five each passed up without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe gun is mounted for use so that it can be pointed at any angle, and\r\nthrough a wide lateral range, without moving the carriage.\r\n\r\n_The Gardner._--The Gatling, as originally made, was for a time\r\nsuperseded by the _Gardner_, which differed from it in having the\r\nbarrels (four or fewer in number) fixed in the same horizontal plane.\r\nThis was worked by a rotatory handle on the side of the gun. The\r\ncartridges slid down a feed-case in a column to the barrel, where they\r\nwere fired by a spring acting on a hammer.\r\n\r\n_The Nordenfelt._--Mr. Nordenfelt’s machine-gun follows this\r\nprecedent; its barrels--10, 5, 4, 2, or 1 in number--also being\r\narranged horizontally in a strong, rigid frame. Each barrel has its\r\nown breech-plug, striker, spring, and extractor, and each fires\r\nindependently of the rest, so that all are not out of action together.\r\nThe gun has a swivelled mount easily elevated and trained, and the\r\nsteel frames take up the force of the discharge. In rapid firing one\r\ngunner can work the firing-handle while another lays and alters the\r\ndirection. The firing is operated by a lever working backwards and\r\nforwards by hand, and the gun can be discharged at the rate of 600\r\nrounds per minute.\r\n\r\n_The Hotchkiss._--The Hotchkiss gun, or revolving cannon, is on a\r\nfresh system, that of intermittent rotation of the barrels without any\r\nrotation of breech or mechanism. There is only one loading piston, one\r\nspring striker, and one extractor for all the barrels. The shock of\r\ndischarge is received against a massive fixed breech, which\r\ndistributes it to the whole body.\r\n\r\nLike the _Nordenfelt_, however, it can be dismounted and put together\r\nagain without the need of tools. The above pattern throws 1 lb.\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\n_The Maxim._--Differing from all these comes the _Maxim_ gun, so much\r\nin evidence now with both land and sea service. It is made up of two\r\nportions:--\r\n\r\n     (1) _Fixed_: a barrel-casing, which is also a water-jacket, and\r\n     breech-casing.\r\n\r\n     (2) _Recoiling_: a barrel and two side plates which carry lock\r\n     and crank.\r\n\r\nThis recoiling portion works inside the fixed.\r\n\r\nThe gun is supplied with ammunition by a belt holding 250 cartridges\r\npassing through a feed-block on the top. Its mechanism is worked\r\n_automatically_; first by the explosion of the charge, which causes\r\nthe barrel to recoil backwards and extends a strong spring which, on\r\nreasserting itself, carries it forwards again. The recoiling part\r\nmoves back about an inch, and this recoil is utilised by bringing\r\ninto play mechanism which extracts the empty cartridge-case, and on\r\nthe spring carrying the barrel forward again moves a fresh one into\r\nposition. Under the barrel casing is the ejector tube through which\r\nthe empty cartridge-cases are ejected from the gun.\r\n\r\nThe rate of fire of the Maxim gun is 600 rounds per minute. Deliberate\r\nfire means about 70 rounds per minute; rapid fire will explode 450\r\nrounds in the same time. As the barrel becomes very hot in use the\r\nbarrel-casing contains seven pints of water to keep it cool. About\r\n2000 rounds can be fired at short intervals; but in continuous firing\r\nthe water boils after some 600 rounds, and needs replenishing after\r\nabout 1000. A valved tube allows steam, but not water to escape.\r\n\r\nThe operator works this gun by pressing a firing-lever or button.\r\nAfter starting the machine he merely sits behind the shield, which\r\nprotects him from the enemy, directing it, as it keeps on firing\r\nautomatically so long as the bands of cartridges are supplied and a\r\nfinger held on the trigger or button. By setting free a couple of\r\nlevers with his left hand, and pressing his shoulder against the\r\npadded shoulder-piece, he is able to elevate or depress, or train the\r\nbarrel horizontally, without in any way interfering with the hail of\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\nWe use two sizes, one with .45 bore for the Navy, which takes an\r\nall-lead bullet weighing 480 grains, and the other with .303 bore, the\r\nordinary nickel-coated rifle bullet for the Army. But as the Maxim\r\ngun can be adapted to every rifle-calibre ammunition it is patronised\r\nby all governments.\r\n\r\nThe gun itself weighs 56 lbs., and is mounted for use in various ways:\r\non a tripod, a field stand, or a field carriage with wheels. This\r\ncarriage has sixteen boxes of ammunition, each containing a belt of\r\n250 cartridges, making 4000 rounds altogether. Its total weight is\r\nabout half a ton, so that it can be drawn by one horse, and it is\r\nbuilt for the roughest cross-country work. A little machine, which can\r\nbe fixed to the wheel, recharges the belts with cartridges by the\r\nworking of a handle.\r\n\r\nFor ships the Maxim is usually mounted on the ordinary naval cone\r\nmount, or it can be clamped to the bulwark of the deck or the military\r\n“top” on the mast.\r\n\r\nBut there is a most ingenious form of parapet mounting, known as the\r\ngarrison mount, which turns the Maxim into a “disappearing gun,” and\r\ncan be used equally well for fortress walls or improvised\r\nentrenchments. The gun is placed over two little wheels on which it\r\ncan be run along by means of a handle pushed behind in something the\r\nfashion of a lawn-mower. Arrived at its destination, the handle, which\r\nis really a rack, is turned downwards, and on twisting one of the\r\nwheels the gun climbs it by means of a pinion-cog till it points over\r\nthe wall, to which hooks at the end of two projecting bars firmly fix\r\nit, the broadened end of the handle being held by its weight to the\r\nground. It is locked while in use, but a few turns of the wheel cause\r\nit to sink out of sight in as many seconds.\r\n\r\nThe rifle-calibre guns may also be used as very light horse artillery\r\nto accompany cavalry by being mounted on a “galloping carriage” drawn\r\nby a couple of horses, and with two seats for the operators. The\r\ncarriage conveys 3000 rounds, and the steel-plated seats turn up and\r\nform shields during action.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that an extra light form of the gun is\r\nmade which may be carried strapped on an infantryman’s back and fired\r\nfrom a tripod. Two of these mounted on a double tricycle can be\r\npropelled at a good pace along a fairly level road, and the riders\r\ndismounting have, in a few moments, a valuable little battery at their\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nThe _Pom-pom_, of which we have heard so much in the late war, is a\r\nlarge edition of the Maxim automatic system with some differences in\r\nthe system. Its calibre is 1-1/2 inches. Instead of bullets it emits\r\nexplosive shells 1 lb. in weight, fitted with percussion fuses which\r\nburst them into about twelve or fourteen pieces. The effective range\r\nis up to 2000 yards, and it will carry to 4000 yards. An improved\r\n_Pom-pom_ recently brought out hurls a 1-1/4 lb. shell with effect at\r\na mark 3000 yards away, and as far as 6000 yards before its energy is\r\nentirely exhausted. The muzzle velocity of this weapon is 2350 feet a\r\nsecond as against the 1800 feet of the older pattern. They both fire\r\n300 rounds a minute.\r\n\r\nThe _Colt_ automatic gun is an American invention whose automatic\r\naction is due to explosion of the charge, not to recoil. The force by\r\nwhich the motions of firing, extracting, and loading are performed is\r\nderived from the powder-gases, a portion of which--passing through a\r\nsmall vent in the muzzle--acts by means of a lever on the mechanism of\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\nThis is also in two parts: (_a_) _barrel_, attached to (_b_)\r\nbreech-casing, in which gear for charging, firing, and ejecting is\r\ncontained. The barrel, made of a strong alloy of nickel, has its\r\ncartridges fed in by means of belts coiled in boxes attached to the\r\nbreech-casing, the boxes moving with the latter so that the movements\r\nof the gun do not affect it. These boxes contain 250 cartridges each\r\nand are easily replaced.\r\n\r\nThe feed-belt is inserted, and the lever thrown down and moved\r\nbackward--once by hand--as far as it will go; this opens the breech\r\nand passes the first cartridge from the belt to the carrier. The lever\r\nis then released and the spring causes it to fly forward, close the\r\nvent, and transfer the cartridge from the carrier to the barrel, also\r\ncompressing the mainspring and opening and closing the breech.\r\n\r\nOn pulling the trigger the shot is fired, and after the bullet has\r\npassed the little vent, but is not yet out of the muzzle, the force of\r\nthe expanding gas, acting through the vent on the piston, sets a\r\ngas-lever in operation which acts on the breech mechanism, opens\r\nbreech, ejects cartridge-case, and feeds another cartridge into the\r\ncarrier. The gas-lever returning forces the cartridge home in the\r\nbarrel and closes and locks the breech.\r\n\r\nThe hammer of the gun acts as the piston of an air-pump, forcing a\r\nstrong jet of air into the chamber, and through the barrel, thus\r\nremoving all unburnt powder, and thoroughly cleansing it. The metal\r\nemployed is strong enough to resist the heaviest charge of\r\nnitro-powder, and the accuracy of its aim is not disturbed by the\r\nvibrations of rapid fire. It does not heat fast, so has no need of a\r\nwater-jacket, any surplus heat being removed by a system of radiation.\r\n\r\nThe bore is made of any rifle calibre for any small-arm ammunition,\r\nand is fitted with a safety-lock. For our own pieces we use the\r\nLee-Metford cartridges. Four hundred shots per minute can be fired.\r\n\r\nThe gun consists altogether of ninety-four pieces, but the\r\nworking-pieces, _i.e._ those only which need be separated for\r\ncleaning, &c., when in the hands of the artilleryman, are less than\r\ntwenty. It can be handled in action by one man, the operation\r\nresembling that of firing a pistol.\r\n\r\nThe machine weighs 40 lbs., and for use by cavalry or infantry can be\r\nmounted on the _Dundonald Galloping Carriage_. The ammunition-box,\r\ncontaining 2000 rounds ready for use, carries the gun on its upper\r\nside, and is mounted on a strong steel axle. A pole with a slotted end\r\nis inserted into a revolving funnel on the bend of the shaft, the\r\nlimbering-up being completed by an automatic bolt and plug.\r\n\r\nThe gun-carriage itself is of steel, with hickory wheels and hickory\r\nand steel shafts, detachable at will. The simple harness suits any\r\nsaddled cavalry horse, and the shafts work in sockets behind the\r\nrider’s legs. Its whole weight with full load of ammunition is under\r\nfour hundredweight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nAs with rifles and the smaller forms of artillery, so also with heavy\r\nordnance, the changes and improvements within the last fifty years\r\nhave been greater than those made during the course of all the\r\nprevious centuries.\r\n\r\nThese changes have affected alike not only the materials from which a\r\nweapon is manufactured, the relative size of calibre and length of\r\nbore, the fashion of mounting and firing, but also the form and weight\r\nof the projectile, the velocity with which it is thrown, and even the\r\nsubstances used in expelling it from the gun.\r\n\r\nCompare for a moment the old cast-iron muzzle-loaders, stubby of\r\nstature, which Wellington’s bronzed veterans served with round cannon\r\nballs, well packed in greasy clouts to make them fit tight, or with\r\nshell and grape shot, throughout the hard-fought day of Waterloo, from\r\na distance which the chroniclers measure by _paces_, so near stood the\r\nopposing ranks to one another.\r\n\r\nOr stand in imagination upon one of Nelson’s stately men-o’-war and\r\nwatch the grimy guns’ crews, eight or ten to each, straining on the\r\nropes. See the still smoking piece hauled inboard, its bore swabbed\r\nout to clean and cool it, then recharged by the muzzle; home go\r\npowder, wad, and the castor full of balls or the chain shot to\r\nsplinter the enemy’s masts, rammed well down ere the gun is again run\r\nout through the port-hole. Now the gunner snatches the flaming\r\nlintstock and, signal given, applies it to the powder grains sprinkled\r\nin the touch-hole. A salvo of fifty starboard guns goes off in one\r\nterrific broadside, crashing across the Frenchman’s decks at such\r\nclose quarters that in two or three places they are set on fire by the\r\nburning wads. Next comes a cry of “Boarders!” and the ships are\r\ngrappled as the boarding-party scrambles over the bulwarks to the\r\nenemy’s deck, a brisk musket-fire from the crowded rigging protecting\r\ntheir advance; meanwhile the larboard guns, with their simultaneous\r\ndischarge, are greeting a new adversary.\r\n\r\nSuch was war a century ago. Compare with it the late South African\r\nCampaign where the range of guns was estimated in _miles_, and after a\r\ncombat lasting from morn to eve, the British general could report: “I\r\ndo not think we have seen a gun or a Boer all day.”\r\n\r\nThe days of hand-to-hand fighting have passed, the mêlée in the ranks\r\nmay be seen no more; in a few years the bayonet may be relegated to\r\nthe limbo of the coat-of-mail or the cast-iron culverin. Yet the\r\nmodern battle-scene bristles with the most death-dealing weapons which\r\nthe ingenuity of man has ever constructed. The hand-drawn machine-gun\r\ndischarges in a couple of minutes as many missiles as a regiment of\r\nWellington’s infantry, with a speed and precision undreamt of by him.\r\nThe quick-firing long-range naval guns now in vogue could annihilate a\r\nfleet or destroy a port without approaching close enough to catch a\r\nglimpse of the personnel of their opponents. The deadly torpedo guards\r\nour waterways more effectually than a squadron of ships.\r\n\r\nAll resources of civilisation have been drawn upon, every triumph of\r\nengineering secured, to forge such weapons as shall strike the hardest\r\nand destroy the most pitilessly. But strange and unexpected the\r\nresult! Where we counted our battle-slain by thousands we now mourn\r\nover the death of hundreds; where whole regiments were mown down our\r\nambulances gather wounded in scattered units. Here is the bright side\r\nof modern war.\r\n\r\nThe muzzle-loading gun has had its day, a very long day and a\r\nsuccessful one. Again and again it has reasserted itself and ousted\r\nits rivals, but at last all difficulties of construction have been\r\nsurmounted and the breech-loader has “come to stay.”\r\n\r\nHowever, our services still contain a large number of muzzle-loading\r\nguns, many of them built at quite a recent period, and adapted as far\r\nas possible to modern requirements. So to these we will first turn our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe earliest guns were made of cast-iron, but this being prone to\r\nburst with a large charge, bronze, brass, and other tougher materials\r\nwere for a long time employed. Most elaborately chased and ornamented\r\nspecimens of these old weapons are to be seen in the Tower, and many\r\nother collections.\r\n\r\nIn the utilitarian days of the past century cheapness and speed in\r\nmanufacture were more sought after than show. Iron was worked in many\r\nnew ways to resist the pressure of explosion.\r\n\r\nArmstrong of Elswick conceived the idea of building up a barrel of\r\n_coiled_ iron by joining a series of short welded cylinders together,\r\nand closing them by a solid forged breech-piece. Over all, again,\r\nwrought-iron coils were shrunk. Subsequently he tried a solid\r\nforged-iron barrel bored out to form a tube. Neither make proving very\r\nsatisfactory, steel tubes were next used, but were too expensive and\r\nuncertain at that stage of manufacture. Again coiled iron was called\r\ninto requisition, and Mr. Frazer of the Royal Gun Factory introduced a\r\nsystem of double and triple coils which was found very successful,\r\nespecially when a thin steel inner tube was substituted for the iron\r\none (1869).\r\n\r\nAll these weapons were rifled, so that there was of necessity a\r\ncorresponding difference in the projectile employed. Conical shells\r\nbeing used, studs were now placed on the body of the shell to fit into\r\nthe rifling grooves, which were made few in number and deeply cut.\r\nThis was apt to weaken the bore of the gun; but on the other hand\r\nmany studs to fit into several shallow grooves weakened the cover of\r\nthe shells.\r\n\r\nVarious modifications were tried, and finally a gas-check which\r\nexpands into the grooves was placed at the base of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe muzzle-loader having thus been turned into a very efficient modern\r\nweapon the next problem to be solved was how to throw a projectile\r\nwith sufficient force to penetrate the iron and steel armour-plates\r\nthen being generally applied to war-ships. “Build larger guns” was the\r\nconclusion arrived at, and presently the arsenals of the Powers were\r\nturning out mammoth weapons up to 100 tons, and even 110 tons in\r\nweight with a calibre of 16 inches and more for their huge shells.\r\nThen was the mighty 35-ton “Woolwich Infant” born (1872), and its\r\nyounger but still bigger brothers, 81 tons, 16-inch bore, followed by\r\nthe Elswick 100-ton giants, some of which were mounted on our defences\r\nin the Mediterranean. But the fearful concussion of such enormous guns\r\nwhen fixed in action on board ship injured the superstruction, and\r\neven destroyed the boats, and the great improvements made in steel\r\nboth for guns and armour soon led to a fresh revolution. Henceforward\r\ninstead of mounting a few very heavy guns we have preferred to trust\r\nto the weight of metal projected by an increased number of smaller\r\nsize, but much higher velocity. And these guns are the quick-firing\r\nbreech-loaders.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest of our up-to-date ordnance is of moderate calibre, the\r\nlargest breech-loaders being 12-inch, 10-inch, and 9.2-inch guns. But\r\nthe elaborateness of its manufacture is such that one big gun takes\r\nnearly as long to “build up” as the ship for which it is destined.\r\nEach weapon has to pass through about sixteen different processes:--\r\n\r\n     (1) The solid (or hollow) ingot is _forged_.\r\n\r\n     (2) _Annealed_, to get rid of strains.\r\n\r\n     (3) It is placed horizontally on a lathe and _rough-turned_.\r\n\r\n     (4) _Rough-bored_ in a lathe.\r\n\r\n     (5) _Hardened._ Heated to a high temperature and plunged, while\r\n     hot, into a bath of rape oil kept cold by a water-bath. It\r\n     cools slowly for seven to eight hours, being moved about at\r\n     intervals by a crane. This makes the steel more elastic and\r\n     tenacious.\r\n\r\n     (6) _Annealed_, _i.e._ reheated to 900° Fahr. and slowly\r\n     cooled. Siemens’ pyrometer is used in these operations.\r\n\r\n     (7) _Tested_ by pieces cut off.\r\n\r\n     (8) _Turned_ and _bored_ for the second time.\r\n\r\n     (9) Carefully turned again for _shrinkage_. Outer coil expanded\r\n     till large enough to fit easily over inner. Inside, set up\r\n     vertically in a pit, has outside lowered on to it, water and\r\n     gas being applied to make all shrink evenly. Other projections,\r\n     hoops, rings, &c., also shrunk on.\r\n\r\n     (10) Finish--_bored_ and _chambered_.\r\n\r\n     (11) _Broached_, or very fine bored, perhaps _lapped_ with lead\r\n     and emery.\r\n\r\n     (12) _Rifled_ horizontally in a machine.\r\n\r\n     (13) Prepared for breech fittings.\r\n\r\n     (14) Taken to the Proof Butts for trial.\r\n\r\n     (15) Drilled for sockets, sights, &c. Lined and engraved.\r\n     Breech fittings, locks, electric firing gear, &c., added. Small\r\n     adjustments made by filing.\r\n\r\n     (16) _Browned_ or _painted_.\r\n\r\nWhen worn the bore can be lined with a new steel tube.\r\n\r\nThese lengthy operations completed, our gun has still to be _mounted_\r\nupon its field-carriage, naval cone, or disappearing mounting, any of\r\nwhich are complicated and delicately-adjusted pieces of mechanism, the\r\nproduct of much time and labour, which we have no space here to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nSome account of the principal parts of these guns has already been\r\ngiven, but the method by which the breech is closed remains to be\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that though guns now barely reach half the weight\r\nof the monster muzzle-loaders, they are even more effective. Thus the\r\n46-ton (12-inch) gun hurls an 850-lb. projectile with a velocity of\r\n2750 foot-seconds, and uses a comparatively small charge. The famous\r\n“81-ton” needed a very big charge for its 1700-lb. shell, and had\r\nlittle more than half the velocity and no such power of penetration.\r\nThis change has been brought about by using a slower-burning explosive\r\nvery powerful in its effects; enlarging the chamber to give it\r\nsufficient air space, and lengthening the chase of the gun so that\r\nevery particle of the powder-gas may be brought into action before\r\nthe shot leaves the muzzle. This system and the substitution of steel\r\nfor the many layers of welded iron, makes our modern guns long and\r\nslim in comparison with the older ones.\r\n\r\nTo resist the pressure of the explosion against the breech end, a\r\ntightly-fitting breech-plug must be employed. The most modern and\r\ningenious is the Welin plug, invented by a Swedish engineer. The\r\nordinary interrupted screw breech-plug has three parts of its\r\ncircumference plane and the other three parts “threaded,” or grooved,\r\nto screw into corresponding grooves in the breech; thus only half of\r\nthe circumference is engaged by the screw. Mr. Welin has cut steps on\r\nthe plug, three of which would be threaded to one plane segment, each\r\nlocking with its counterpart in the breech. In this case there are\r\nthree segments engaged to each one left plane, and the strength of the\r\nscrew is almost irresistible. The plug, which is hinged at the side,\r\nhas therefore been shortened by one-third, and is light enough to\r\nswing clear with one touch of the handwheel that first rotates and\r\nunlocks it.\r\n\r\nThe method of firing is this: The projectile lifted (by hydraulic\r\npower on a ship) into the loading tray is swung to the mouth of the\r\nbreech and pushed into the bore. A driving-band attached near its base\r\nis so notched at the edges that it jams the shell closely and prevents\r\nit slipping back if loaded at a high angle of elevation. The powder\r\ncharge being placed in the chamber the breech-plug is now swung-to and\r\nturned till it locks close. The vent-axial or inner part of this\r\nbreech-plug (next to the charge), which is called from its shape the\r\n“mushroom-head,” encloses between its head and the screw-plug the de\r\nBange obturator, a flat canvas pad of many layers soaked with mutton\r\nfat tightly packed between discs of tin. When the charge explodes, the\r\nmushroom-head--forced back upon the pad--compresses it till its edges\r\nbulge against the tube and prevent any escape of gas breechwards.\r\n\r\nThe electric spark which fires the charge is passed in from outside by\r\nmeans of a minute and ingenious apparatus fitted into a little vent or\r\ntube in the mushroom-head. As the electric circuit cannot be completed\r\ntill the breech-plug is screwed quite home there is now no more fear\r\nof a premature explosion than of double loading. If the electric gear\r\nis disordered the gun can be fired equally well and safely by a\r\npercussion tube.\r\n\r\nThis description is of a typical large gun, and may be applied to all\r\ncalibres and also to the larger quick-firers. The mechanism as the\r\nbreech is swung open again withdraws the empty cartridge. So valuable\r\nhas de Bange’s obturator proved, however, that guns up to the 6-inch\r\ncalibre now have the powder charge thrown into the chamber in bags,\r\nthus saving the weight of the metal tubes hitherto necessary.\r\n\r\nOf course several types of breech-loading guns are used in the\r\nService, but the above are the most modern.\r\n\r\nThe favourite mode of construction at the present time is the\r\nwire-wound barrel, the building up of which is completed by covering\r\nthe many layers of wire with an outer tube or jacket expanded by heat\r\nbefore it is slipped on in order that it may fit closely when cold. A\r\nprevious make, without wire, is strengthened by rings or hoops also\r\nshrunk on hot.\r\n\r\nThe quick-firers proper are of many sizes, 8-inch, 7.5-inch, 6-inch,\r\n4.7-inch, 4-inch, and 3-inch (12-pounders). The naval type is as a\r\nrule longer and lighter than those made for the rough usage of field\r\ncampaigning and have a much greater range. There are also smaller\r\nquick-firers, 3-pounders and 6-pounders with bore something over\r\n1-inch and 2-inch (Nordenfelt, Hotchkiss, Vickers-Maxim). Some of the\r\nhigh velocity 12-pounders being employed as garrison guns along with\r\n6-inch and 4.7-inch, and the large calibre howitzers.\r\n\r\nWe still use howitzer batteries of 5-inch bore in the field and in the\r\nsiege-train, all being short, rifled, breech-loading weapons, as they\r\nthrow a heavy shell with smallish charges at a high angle of\r\nelevation, but cover a relatively short distance. A new pattern of\r\n8-inch calibre is now under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contrast the potencies of some of these guns, all\r\nof which use cordite charges.\r\n\r\n  +----------+---------------+-----------+----------------+-----------+\r\n  |Calibre.  |    Charge.    |Weight of  |Muzzle Velocity |Number of  |\r\n  |          |               |  Shot.    |      in        |Rounds per |\r\n  |          |               |           | Foot Seconds.  |  Minute.  |\r\n  +----------+---------------+-----------+----------------+-----------+\r\n  | 12 inch  |207 lbs.       | 850 lbs.  |     2750       |    1      |\r\n  |  8  ”    | 52  ”         | 210  ”    |     2750       |    5      |\r\n  |  6  ”    | 25  ”         | 100  ”    |     2775       |    8      |\r\n  |4.7  ”    |  9  ”         |  45  ”    |     2600       |   12      |\r\n  |  3  ”    |  2 lbs. 9 oz. |12.5  ”    |     2600       |   20      |\r\n  +----------+---------------+-----------+----------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Simms armour-clad motor-car for coast defence.\r\nMaxim guns and Pom-pom in action._]\r\n\r\nIn the armament of our fine Navy guns are roughly distributed as\r\nfollows:--81-ton, 13-1/2-inch, and superseded patterns of machine-guns\r\nsuch as Gatling’s, Gardner’s, and Nordenfelt’s, besides a few\r\nsurviving muzzle-loaders, &c., are carried only by the oldest\r\nbattleships.\r\n\r\nThe first-class battleships are chiefly supplied with four 12-inch\r\nguns in barbettes, twelve 6-inch as secondary batteries, and a number\r\nof smaller quick-firers on the upper decks and in the fighting tops,\r\nalso for use in the boats, to which are added several Maxims.\r\n\r\nThe first-class cruisers have 9.2 as their largest calibre, with a\r\nlessened proportion of 6-inch, &c. Some of the newest bear only 7-1/2\r\nor 6-inch guns as their heaviest ordnance; like the second-class\r\ncruisers which, however, add several 4.7‘s between these and their\r\nsmall quick-firers.\r\n\r\nVessels of inferior size usually carry nothing more powerful than the\r\n4.7.\r\n\r\nAll are now armed with torpedo tubes.\r\n\r\nThese same useful little quick-firers and machine-guns have been the\r\nlethal weapons which made the armoured trains so formidable. Indeed,\r\nthere seems no limit to their value both for offence and defence, for\r\nthe battle chariot of the ancient Briton has its modern successor in\r\nthe Simms’ motor war car lately exhibited at the Crystal Palace. This\r\narmour-plated movable fort is intended primarily for coast defence,\r\nbut can work off beaten tracks over almost any sort of country. It is\r\npropelled at the rate of nine miles an hour by a 16-horse-power\r\nmotor, carrying all its own fuel, two pom-poms, two small Maxims, and\r\n10,000 rounds of ammunition, besides the necessary complement of men\r\nand searchlights for night use, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe searchlight, by the way, has taken the place of all former\r\ninventions thrown from guns, such as ground-light balls, or parachute\r\nlights with a time-fuse which burst in the air and remained suspended,\r\nbetraying the enemy’s proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the linked chain and “double-headed” shot, the\r\n“canister”--iron balls packed in thin iron or tin cylinders which\r\nwould travel about 350 yards--the “carcasses” filled with inflammable\r\ncomposition for firing ships and villages, are as much out of date as\r\nthe solid round shot or cannon-ball. Young Shrapnell’s invention a\r\ncentury ago of the form of shell that bears his name, a number of\r\nballs arranged in a case containing also a small bursting-charge fired\r\neither by percussion or by a time-fuse, has practically replaced them\r\nall. Thrown with great precision of aim its effective range is now up\r\nto 5000 yards. A 15-pounder shrapnell shell, for instance, contains\r\n192 bullets, and covers several hundred yards with the scattered\r\nmissiles flying with extreme velocity.\r\n\r\nCommon shell, from 2-1/2 to 3 calibres long, contains an explosive\r\nonly. Another variety is segment shell, made of pieces built up in a\r\nring with a bursting charge in the centre which presently shatters\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Palliser shell has a marvellous penetrating power when used\r\nagainst iron plates. But, _mirabile dictu!_ experiments tried within\r\nthe past few months prove that a soft cap added externally enables a\r\nprojectile to pierce with ease armour which had previously defied\r\nevery attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago gunpowder was still the one driving power which\r\nstarted the projectile on its flight. It is composed of some 75 parts\r\nof saltpetre or nitrate of potash, 15 parts of carefully prepared\r\ncharcoal, and 10 parts of sulphur. This composition imprisons a large\r\namount of oxygen for combustion and is found to act most successfully\r\nwhen formed into rather large prismatic grains.\r\n\r\nOn the abolition of the old flint-lock its place was taken by a\r\ndetonating substance enclosed in a copper cap, and some time later\r\ninventors came forward with new and more powerful explosives to\r\nsupersede the use of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBy treating cotton with nitric and sulphuric acid reaction\r\n_gun-cotton_ was produced; and a year later glycerine treated in the\r\nsame manner became known to commerce as _nitro-glycerine_. This liquid\r\nform being inconvenient to handle, some inert granular substance such\r\nas infusorial earth was used to absorb the nitro-glycerine, and\r\n_dynamite_ was the result.\r\n\r\nThe explosion of gun-cotton was found to be too sudden and rapid for\r\nrifles or cannon; it was liable to burst the piece instead of blowing\r\nout the charge. In order to lessen the rapidity of its ignition\r\nordinary cotton was mixed with it, or its threads were twisted round\r\nsome inert substance.\r\n\r\nWhen repeating-rifles and machine-guns came into general use a\r\nsmokeless powder became necessary. Such powders as a rule contain\r\nnitro-cellulose (gun-cotton) or nitro-glycerine, or both. These are\r\ncombined into a plastic, gluey composition, which is then made up into\r\nsticks or pellets of various shapes, and usually of large size to\r\nlessen the extreme rapidity of their combustion. Substances such as\r\ntan, paraffin, starch, bran, peat, &c., &c., and many mineral salts,\r\nare used in forming low explosives from high ones.\r\n\r\nTo secure complete combustion some of the larger pellets are made with\r\na central hole, or even pierced by many holes, so that the fire\r\npenetrates the entire mass and carries off all its explosive\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nOur _cordite_ consists of nitro-glycerine dissolving di-nitro\r\ncellulose by the acid of a volatile solvent and a mineral jelly or\r\noil. This compound is semi-fluid, and being passed like macaroni\r\nthrough round holes in a metal plate it forms strings or cords of\r\nvarying size according to the diameter of the holes. Hence the name,\r\ncordite.\r\n\r\nMany experiments in search of more powerful explosives resulted in an\r\nalmost universal adoption of picric acid as the base. This acid is\r\nitself produced by the action of nitric acid upon carbolic acid, and\r\neach nation has its own fashion of preparing it for artillery.\r\n\r\nThe French began with _mélinite_ in 1885, this being a mixture of\r\npicric acid and gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nThe composition of _lyddite_ (named from its place of manufacture,\r\nLydd, in Kent) is a jealously-guarded British secret. This substance\r\nwas first used in 5-inch howitzers during the late Soudan campaign,\r\nplaying a part in the bombardment of Omdurman. The effect of the\r\n50-lb. lyddite shells upon the South African kopjes is described as\r\nastounding. When the yellow cloud had cleared away trees were seen\r\nuprooted, rocks pulverised, the very face of the earth had changed.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to utilise dynamite for shells, some\r\nof the guns employing compressed air as their motive power. The United\r\nStates some years ago went to great expense in setting up for this\r\npurpose heavy pneumatic plant, which has recently been disposed of as\r\ntoo cumbrous. Dudley’s “Aërial Torpedo” gun discharged a 13-lb. shell\r\ncontaining explosive gelatine, gun-cotton, and fulminate of mercury by\r\nigniting the small cordite charge in a parallel tube, through a vent\r\nin which the partially cooled gases acted on the projectile in the\r\nbarrel. This was rotated in the air by inclined blades on a tailpiece,\r\nas the barrel could not be rifled for fear of the heat set up by\r\nfriction. Some guns actuated on much the same principle are said to\r\nhave been used with effect in the Hispano-American war. Mr. Hudson\r\nMaxim with his explosive “maximite” claims to throw half a ton of\r\ndynamite about a mile, and a one-ton shell to half that distance.\r\n\r\nBut even these inventors are outstripped by Professor Birkeland, who\r\nundertakes to hurl a projectile weighing two tons from an iron tube\r\ncoiled with copper wire down which an electric current is passed; thus\r\ndoing away entirely with the need of a firing-charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE GUN FACTORY.\r\n\r\nLet us pay a visit to one of our gun factories and get some idea of\r\nthe multiform activities necessary to the turning out complete of a\r\nsingle piece of ordnance or a complicated machine-gun. We enter the\r\nenormous workshop, glazed as to roof and sides, full of the varied\r\nbuzz and whirr and clank of the machinery. Up and down the long bays\r\nstand row upon row of lathes, turning, milling, polishing, boring,\r\nrifling--all moving automatically, and with a precision which leaves\r\nnothing to be desired. The silent attendants seem to have nothing in\r\ntheir own hands, they simply watch that the cutting does not go too\r\nfar, and with a touch of the guiding handles regulate the pace or\r\noccasionally insert a fresh tool. The bits used in these processes are\r\nself-cleaning, so the machinery is never clogged; and on the ground\r\nlie little heaps of brass chips cut away by the minute milling tools;\r\nor in other places it is bestrewn with shavings of brass and steel\r\nwhich great chisels peel off as easily as a carpenter shaves a deal\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nHere an enormous steel ingot, forged solid, heated again and again in\r\na huge furnace and beaten by steam-hammers, or pressed by hydraulic\r\npower between each heating till it is brought to the desired size and\r\nshape, is having its centre bored through by a special drill which\r\ntakes out a solid core. This operation is termed “trepanning,” and is\r\napplied to guns not exceeding eight inches; those of larger calibre\r\nbeing rough-bored on a lathe, and mandrils placed in them during the\r\nsubsequent forgings. The tremendous heat generated during the boring\r\nprocesses--we may recall how Benjamin Thompson made water boil by the\r\nexperimental boring of a cannon--is kept down by streams of soapy\r\nwater continually pumped through and over the metal. We notice this\r\nflow of lubricating fluid in all directions, from oil dropping slowly\r\non to the small brass-milling machines to this fountain-play of water\r\nwhich makes a pleasant undertone amidst the jangle of the machines.\r\nBut these machines are less noisy than we anticipated; in their actual\r\nworking they emit scarcely the slightest sound. What strikes us more\r\nthan the supreme exactness with which each does its portion of the\r\nwork, is the great deliberateness of its proceeding. All the hurry and\r\nbustle is above us, caused by the driving-bands from the engine, which\r\nkeeps the whole machinery of the shed in motion. Suddenly, with harsh\r\ncreakings, a great overhead crane comes jarring along the bay, drops a\r\nchain, grips up a gun-barrel, and, handling this mass of many tons’\r\nweight as easily as we should lift a walking-stick, swings it off to\r\nundergo another process of manufacture.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to the next lathe where a still larger forging is being\r\nturned externally, supported on specially devised running gear, many\r\ndifferent cutters acting upon it at the same time, so that it is\r\ngradually assuming the tapering, banded appearance familiar to us in\r\nthe completed state.\r\n\r\nWe turn, fairly bewildered, from one stage of manufacture to another.\r\nHere is a gun whose bore is being “chambered” to the size necessary\r\nfor containing the firing charge. Further along we examine a more\r\nfinished weapon in process of preparation to receive the breech-plug\r\nand other fittings. Still another we notice which has been\r\n“fine-bored” to a beautifully smooth surface but is being improved yet\r\nmore by “lapping” with lead and emery powder.\r\n\r\nIn the next shed a marvellous machine is rifling the interior of a\r\nbarrel with a dexterity absolutely uncanny, for the tool which does\r\nthe rifling has to be rotated in order to give the proper “twist” at\r\nthe same moment as it is advancing lengthwise down the bore. The\r\ngrooves are not made simultaneously but as a rule one at a time, the\r\ndistance between them being kept by measurements on a prepared disc.\r\n\r\nNow we have reached the apparatus for the wire-wound guns, a principle\r\nrepresenting the _ne plus ultra_ of strength and durability hitherto\r\nevolved. The rough-bored gun is placed upon a lathe which revolves\r\nslowly, drawing on to it from a reel mounted at one side a continuous\r\nlayer of steel ribbon about a quarter of an inch wide. On a 12-inch\r\ngun there is wound some 117 miles of this wire! fourteen layers of it\r\nat the muzzle end and seventy-five at the breech end. Heavy weights\r\nregulate the tension of the wire, which varies for each layer, the\r\noutermost being at the lowest tension, which will resist a pressure of\r\nover 100 tons to the square inch.\r\n\r\nWe next enter the division in which the gun cradles and mounts are\r\nprepared, where we see some of the heaviest work carried out by\r\nelectric dynamos, the workman sitting on a raised platform to keep\r\ncareful watch over his business.\r\n\r\nPassing through this with interested but cursory inspection of the\r\ncone mountings for quick-firing naval guns, some ingenious elevating\r\nand training gear and a field carriage whose hydraulic buffers merit\r\ncloser examination, we come to the shell department where all kinds of\r\nprojectiles are manufactured. Shrapnel in its various forms,\r\narmour-piercing shells, forged steel or cast-iron, and small brass\r\ncartridges for the machine-guns may be found here; and the beautifully\r\ndelicate workmanship of the fuse arrangements attracts our admiration.\r\nBut we may not linger; the plant for the machine-guns themselves claim\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nOwing to the complexity and minute mechanism of these weapons almost a\r\nhundred different machines are needed, some of the milling machines\r\ntaking a large selection of cutters upon one spindle. Indeed, in many\r\nparts of the works one notices the men changing their tools for others\r\nof different size or application. Some of the boring machines work two\r\nbarrels at the same time, others can drill three barrels or polish a\r\ncouple simultaneously. But there are hundreds of minute operations\r\nwhich need to be done separately, down to the boring of screw holes\r\nand cutting the groove on a screw-head. Many labourers are employed\r\nupon the lock alone. And every portion is gauged correctly to the most\r\ninfinitesimal fraction, being turned out by the thousand, that every\r\nseparate item may be interchangeable among weapons of the same make.\r\n\r\nLook at the barrel which came grey and dull from its first turning now\r\nas it is dealt with changing into bright silver. Here it is adjusted\r\nupon the hydraulic rifling machine which will prepare it to carry the\r\nsmall-arm bullet (.303 inch). That one of larger calibre is rifled to\r\nfire a small shell. Further on, the barrels and their jackets are\r\nbeing fitted together and the different parts assembled and screwed\r\nup. We have not time to follow the perfect implement to its mounting,\r\nnor to do more than glance at those howitzers and the breech mechanism\r\nof the 6-inch quick-firers near which our guide indicates piles of\r\nflat cases to keep the de Bange obturators from warping while out of\r\nuse. For the afternoon is waning and the foundry still unvisited.\r\n\r\nTo reach it we pass through the smith’s shop and pause awhile to watch\r\na supply of spanners being roughly stamped by an immense machine out\r\nof metal plates and having their edges tidied off before they can be\r\nfurther perfected. A steam-hammer is busily engaged in driving\r\nmandrils of increasing size through the centre of a red-hot forging.\r\nThe heat from the forges is tremendous, and though it is tempered by a\r\nspray of falling water we are glad to escape into the next shed.\r\n\r\nHere we find skilled workmen carefully preparing moulds by taking in\r\nsand the exact impression of a wooden dummy. Fortunately we arrive\r\njust as a series of casts deeply sunk in the ground are about to be\r\nmade. Two brawny labourers bear forward an enormous iron crucible,\r\nred-hot from the furnace, filled with seething liquid--manganese\r\nbronze, we are told--which, when an iron bar is dipped into it, throws\r\nup tongues of beautiful greenish-golden flame. The smith stirs and\r\nclears off the scum as coolly as a cook skims her broth! Now it is\r\nready, the crucible is again lifted and its contents poured into a\r\nlarge funnel from which it flows into the moulds beneath and fills\r\nthem to the level of the floor. At each one a helper armed with an\r\niron bar takes his stand and stirs again to work up all dross and\r\nair-bubbles to the surface before the metal sets--a scene worthy of a\r\npainter’s brush.\r\n\r\nAnd so we leave them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRIGIBLE TORPEDOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of warlike inventions is the history of a continual\r\nsee-saw between the discovery of a new means of defence and the\r\ndiscovery of a fresh means of attack. At one time a shield is devised\r\nto repel a javelin; at another a machine to hurl the javelin with\r\nincreased violence against the shield; then the shield is reinforced\r\nby complete coats of mail, and so on. The ball of invention has rolled\r\nsteadily on into our own times, gathering size as it rolls, and\r\nbringing more and more startling revolutions in the art of war. To-day\r\nit is a battle between the forces of nature, controllable by man in\r\nthe shape of “high explosives,” and the resisting power of metals\r\ntempered to extreme toughness.\r\n\r\nAt present it looks as if, on the sea at least, the attack were\r\nstronger than the defence. Our warships may be cased in the hardest\r\nmetal several inches thick until they become floating forts, almost\r\nimpregnable to the heaviest shells. They may be provided with terrible\r\nengines able to give blow for blow, and be manned with the stoutest\r\nhearts in the world. And yet, were a sea-fight in progress, a blow,\r\ncrushing and resistless, might at any time come upon the vessel from a\r\nquarter whence, even though suspected, its coming might escape\r\nnotice--below the waterline. Were it possible to case an ironclad from\r\ndeck to keel in foot-thick plating, the metal would crumple like a\r\nbiscuit-box under the terrible impact of the torpedo.\r\n\r\nThis destructive weapon is an object of awe not so much from what it\r\nhas done as from what it can do. The instances of a torpedo shivering\r\na vessel in actual warfare are but few. Yet its moral effect must be\r\nimmense. Even though it may miss its mark, the very fact of its\r\npossible presence will, especially at night-time, tend to keep the\r\ncommanding minds of a fleet very much on the stretch, and to destroy\r\ntheir efficiency. A torpedo knows no half measures. It is either\r\nentirely successful or utterly useless. Its construction entails great\r\nexpense, but inasmuch as it can, if directed aright, send a million of\r\nthe enemy’s money and a regiment of men to the bottom, the discharge\r\nof a torpedo is, after all, but the setting of a sprat to catch a\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nThe aim of inventors has been to endow the dirigible torpedo, fit for\r\nuse in the open sea, with such qualities that when once launched on\r\nits murderous course it can pursue its course in the required\r\ndirection without external help. The difficulties to be overcome in\r\narriving at a serviceable weapon have been very great owing to the\r\ncomplexity of the problem. A torpedo cannot be fired through water\r\nlike a cannon shell through air. Water, though yielding, is\r\nincompressible, and offers to a moving body a resistance increasing\r\nwith the speed of that body. Therefore the torpedo must contain its\r\nown motive power and its own steering apparatus, and be in effect a\r\nminiature submarine vessel complete in itself. To be out of sight and\r\ndanger it must travel beneath the surface and yet not sink to the\r\nbottom; to be effective it must possess great speed, a considerable\r\nsphere of action, and be able to counteract any chance currents it may\r\nmeet on its way.\r\n\r\nAmong purely automobile torpedoes the Whitehead is easily first. After\r\nthirty years it still holds the lead for open sea work. It is a very\r\nmarvel of ingenious adaptation of means to an end, and as it has\r\nfulfilled most successfully the conditions set forth above for an\r\neffective projectile it will be interesting to examine in some detail\r\nthis most valuable weapon.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 one Captain Lupuis of the Austrian navy experimented with a\r\nsmall fireship which he directed along the surface of the sea by means\r\nof ropes and guiding lines. This fireship was to be loaded with\r\nexplosives which should ignite immediately on coming into collision\r\nwith the vessel aimed at. The Austrian Government declared his scheme\r\nunworkable in its crude form, and the Captain looked about for some\r\none to help him throw what he felt to be a sound idea into a practical\r\nshape. He found the man he wanted in Mr. Whitehead, who was at that\r\ntime manager of an engineering establishment at Fiume. Mr. Whitehead\r\nfell in enthusiastically with his proposition, at once discarded the\r\ncomplicated system of guiding ropes, and set to work to solve the\r\nproblem on his own lines. At the end of two years, during which he\r\nworked in secret, aided only by a trusted mechanic and a boy, his son,\r\nhe constructed the first torpedo of the type that bears his name. It\r\nwas made of steel, was fourteen inches in diameter, weighed 300 lbs.,\r\nand carried eighteen pounds of dynamite as explosive charge. But its\r\npowers were limited. It could attain a rate of but six knots an hour\r\nunder favourable conditions, and then for a short distance only. Its\r\nconduct was uncertain. Sometimes it would run along the surface, at\r\nothers make plunges for the bottom. However, the British Government,\r\nrecognising the importance of Mr. Whitehead’s work, encouraged him to\r\nperfect his instrument, and paid him a large sum for the patent\r\nrights. Pattern succeeded pattern, until comparative perfection was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nDescribed briefly, the Whitehead torpedo is cigar-shaped, blunt-nosed\r\nand tapering gradually towards the tail, so following the lines of a\r\nfish. Its length is twelve times its diameter, which varies in\r\ndifferent patterns from fourteen to nineteen inches. At the fore end\r\nis the striker, and at the tail are a couple of three-bladed screws\r\nworking on one shaft in opposite directions, to economise power and\r\nobviate any tendency of the torpedo to travel in a curve; and two sets\r\nof rudders, the one horizontal, the other vertical. The latest form of\r\nthe torpedo has a speed of twenty-nine knots and a range of over a\r\nthousand yards.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo is divided into five compartments by watertight steel\r\nbulkheads. At the front is the _explosive head_, containing wet\r\ngun-cotton, or some other explosive. The “war head,” as it is called,\r\nis detachable, and for practice purposes its place is taken by a\r\ndummy-head filled with wood to make the balance correct.\r\n\r\nNext comes the _air chamber_, filled with highly-compressed air to\r\ndrive the engines; after it the _balance chamber_, containing the\r\napparatus for keeping the torpedo at its proper depth; then the\r\n_engine-room_; and, last of all, the _buoyancy chamber_, which is\r\nair-tight and prevents the torpedo from sinking at the end of its run.\r\n\r\nTo examine the compartments in order:--\r\n\r\nIn the very front of the torpedo is the pistol and primer-charge for\r\nigniting the gun-cotton. Especial care has been taken over this part\r\nof the mechanism, to prevent the torpedo being as dangerous to friends\r\nas to foes. The pistol consists of a steel plug sliding in a metal\r\ntube, at the back end of which is the fulminating charge. Until the\r\nplug is driven right in against this charge there can be no explosion.\r\nThree precautions are taken against this happening prematurely. In the\r\nfirst place, there is on the forward end of the plug a thread cut, up\r\nwhich a screw-fan travels as soon as it strikes the water. Until the\r\ntorpedo has run forty-five feet the fan has not reached the end of its\r\ntravel, and the plug consequently cannot be driven home. Even when the\r\nplug is quite free only a heavy blow will drive it in, as a little\r\ncopper pin has to be sheared through by the impact. And before the\r\nscrew can unwind at all, a safety-pin must be withdrawn at the moment\r\nof firing. So that a torpedo is harmless until it has passed outside\r\nthe zone of danger to the discharging vessel.\r\n\r\nThe detonating charge is thirty-eight grains of fulminate of mercury,\r\nand the primer-charge consists of six one-ounce discs of dry\r\ngun-cotton contained in a copper cylinder, the front end of which is\r\nconnected with the striker-tube of the pistol. The fulminate, on\r\nreceiving a blow, expands 2500 times, giving a violent shock to the\r\ngun-cotton discs, which in turn explode and impart a shock to the main\r\ncharge, 200 lbs. of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nThe _air chamber_ is made of the finest compressed steel, or of\r\nphosphor-bronze, a third of an inch thick. When ready for action this\r\nchamber has to bear a pressure of 1350 lbs. to the square inch. So\r\nsevere is the compression that in the largest-sized torpedoes the air\r\nin this chamber weighs no less than 63 lbs. The air is forced in by\r\nvery powerful pumps of a special design. Aft of this chamber is that\r\ncontaining the stop-valve and steering-gear. The stop-valve is a\r\nspecies of air-tap sealing the air chamber until the torpedo is to be\r\ndischarged. The valve is so arranged that it is impossible to insert\r\nthe torpedo into the firing-tube before the valve has been opened,\r\nand so brought the air chamber into communication with the\r\nstarting-valve, which does not admit air to the engines till after the\r\nprojectile has left the tube.\r\n\r\nThe _steering apparatus_ is undoubtedly the most ingenious of the many\r\nclever contrivances packed into a Whitehead torpedo. Its function is\r\nto keep the torpedo on an even keel at a depth determined before the\r\ndischarge. This is effected by means of two agencies, a swinging\r\nweight, and a valve which is driven in by water pressure as the\r\ntorpedo sinks. When the torpedo points head downwards the weight\r\nswings forward, and by means of connecting levers brings the\r\nhorizontal rudders up. As the torpedo rises the weight becomes\r\nvertical and the rudder horizontal. This device only insures that the\r\ntorpedo shall travel horizontally. The valve makes it keep its proper\r\ndepth by working in conjunction with the pendulum. The principle,\r\nwhich is too complicated for full description, is, put briefly, a\r\ntendency of the valve to correct the pendulum whenever the latter\r\nswings too far. Lest the pendulum should be violently shaken by the\r\ndischarge there is a special controlling gear which keeps the rudders\r\nfixed until the torpedo has proceeded a certain distance, when the\r\nsteering mechanism is released. The steering-gear does not work\r\ndirectly on the rudder. Mr. Whitehead found in his earlier experiments\r\nthat the pull exerted by the weight and valve was not sufficient to\r\nmove the rudders against the pressure of the screws. He therefore\r\nintroduced a beautiful little auxiliary engine, called the\r\nservo-motor, which is to the torpedo what the steam steering-gear is\r\nto a ship. The servo-motor, situated in the _engine-room_, is only\r\nfour inches long, but the power it exerts by means of compressed air\r\nis so great that a pressure of half an ounce exerted by the\r\nsteering-gear produces a pull of 160 lbs. on the rudders.\r\n\r\nThe engines consist of three single-action cylinders, their cranks\r\nworking at an angle of 120° to one another, so that there is no “dead”\r\nor stopping point in their action. They are very small, but, thanks to\r\nthe huge pressure in the air chamber, develop nearly thirty-one\r\nhorse-power. Lest they should “race,” or revolve too quickly, while\r\npassing from the tube to the water and do themselves serious damage,\r\nthey are provided with a “delay action valve,” which is opened by the\r\nimpact of the torpedo against the water. Further, lest the air should\r\nbe admitted to the cylinders at a very high pressure gradually\r\ndecreasing to zero, a “reducing valve” or governor is added to keep\r\nthe engines running at a constant speed.\r\n\r\nWhitehead torpedoes are fired from tubes above or below the waterline.\r\nDeck tubes have the advantage of being more easily aimed, but when\r\nloaded they are a source of danger, as any stray bullet or shell from\r\nan enemy’s ship might explode the torpedo with dire results. There is\r\ntherefore an increasing preference for submerged tubes. An ingenious\r\ndevice is used for aiming the torpedo, which makes allowances for the\r\nspeed of the ship from which it is fired, the speed of the ship aimed\r\nat, and the speed of the torpedo itself. When the moment for firing\r\narrives, the officer in charge presses an electric button, which sets\r\nin motion an electric magnet fixed to the side of the tube. The magnet\r\nreleases a heavy ball which falls and turns the “firing rod.”\r\nCompressed air or a powder discharge is brought to bear on the rear\r\nend of the torpedo, which, if submerged, darts out from the vessel’s\r\nside along a guiding bar, from which it is released at both ends\r\nsimultaneously, thus avoiding the great deflection towards the stern\r\nwhich would occur were a broadside torpedo not held at the nose till\r\nthe tail is clear. This guiding apparatus enables a torpedo to leave\r\nthe side of a vessel travelling at high speed almost at right angles\r\nto the vessel’s path.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that a Whitehead torpedo is a costly\r\nprojectile, and that its value--£500 or more--makes the authorities\r\nvery careful of its welfare. During practice with “blank” torpedoes a\r\n“Holmes light” is attached. This light is a canister full of calcium\r\nphosphide to which water penetrates through numerous holes, causing\r\ngas to be thrown off and rise to the surface, where, on meeting with\r\nthe oxygen of the air, it bursts into flame and gives off dense\r\nvolumes of heavy smoke, disclosing the position of the torpedo by\r\nnight or day.\r\n\r\nAt Portsmouth are storehouses containing upwards of a thousand\r\ntorpedoes. Every torpedo is at intervals taken to pieces, examined,\r\ntested, and put together again after full particulars have been taken\r\ndown on paper. Each steel “baby” is kept bright and clean, coated\r\nwith a thin layer of oil, lest a single spot of rust should mar its\r\nbeauty. An interesting passage from Lieutenant G. E. Armstrong’s book\r\non “Torpedoes and Torpedo Vessels” will illustrate the scrupulous\r\nexactness observed in all things relating to the torpedo depôts: “As\r\nan example of the care with which the stores are kept it may be\r\nmentioned that a particular tiny pattern of brass screw which forms\r\npart of the torpedo’s mechanism and which is valued at about\r\ntwopence-halfpenny per gross, is never allowed to be a single number\r\nwrong. On one occasion, when the stocktaking took place, it was found\r\nthat instead of 5000 little screws being accounted for by the man who\r\nwas told off to count them, there were only 4997. Several foolscap\r\nletters were written and exchanged over these three small screws,\r\nthough their value was not more than a small fraction of a farthing.”\r\n\r\nThe classic instance of the effectiveness of this type of torpedo is\r\nthe battle of the Yalu, fought between the Japanese and Chinese fleets\r\nin 1894. The Japanese had been pounding their adversaries for hours\r\nwith their big guns without producing decisive results. So they\r\ndetermined upon a torpedo attack, which was delivered early in the\r\nmorning under cover of darkness, and resulted in the destruction of a\r\ncruiser, the _Ting Yuen_. The next night a second incursion of the\r\nJapanese destroyers wrecked another cruiser, the _Lai Yuen_, which\r\nsunk within five minutes of being struck; sank the _Wei Yuen_, an old\r\nwooden vessel used as a training-school; and blew a large steam\r\nlaunch out of the water on to an adjacent wharf. These hits “below the\r\nbelt” were too much for the Chinese, who soon afterwards surrendered\r\nto their more scientific and better equipped foes.\r\n\r\nIf a general naval war broke out to-day most nations would undoubtedly\r\npin their faith to the Whitehead torpedo for use in the open sea, now\r\nthat its accuracy has been largely increased by the gyroscope, a heavy\r\nflywheel attachment revolving rapidly at right angles to the path of\r\nthe torpedo, and rendering a change of direction almost impossible.\r\n\r\nFor harbour defence the Brennan or its American rival, the\r\nSims-Edison, might be employed. They are both torpedoes dirigible from\r\na fixed base by means of connecting wires. The presence of these wires\r\nconstitutes an obstacle to their being of service in a fleet action.\r\n\r\nThe Brennan is used by our naval authorities. It is the invention of a\r\nMelbourne watchmaker. Being a comparatively poor man, Mr. Brennan\r\napplied to the Colonial Government for grants to aid him in the\r\nmanufacture and development of his torpedo, and he was supplied with\r\nsufficient money to perfect it. In 1881 he was requested by our\r\nAdmiralty to bring his invention to England, where it was experimented\r\nupon, and pronounced so efficient for harbour and creek defence that\r\nat the advice of the Royal Engineers Mr. Brennan was paid large sums\r\nfor his patents and services.\r\n\r\nThe Brennan torpedo derives its motive power from a very powerful\r\nengine on shore, capable of developing 100 horse-power, with which it\r\nis connected by stout piano wires. One end of these wires is wound on\r\ntwo reels inside the torpedo, each working a screw; the other end is\r\nattached to two winding drums driven at high velocity by the engine on\r\nshore. As the drums wind in the wire the reels in the torpedo revolve;\r\nconsequently, the harder the torpedo is pulled back the faster it\r\nmoves forward, liked a trained trotting mare. The steering of the\r\ntorpedo is effected by alterations in the relative speeds of the\r\ndrums, and consequently of the screws. The drums run loose on the\r\nengine axle, and are thrown in or out of gear by means of a\r\nfriction-brake, so that their speed can be regulated without altering\r\nthe pace of the engines. Any increase in the speed of one drum causes\r\na corresponding decrease in the speed of the other. The torpedo can be\r\nsteered easily to right or left within an arc of forty degrees on each\r\nside of straight ahead; but when once launched it cannot be retrieved\r\nexcept by means of a boat. Its path is marked by a Holmes light,\r\ndescribed above. It has a 200-lb. gun-cotton charge, and is fitted\r\nwith an apparatus for maintaining a proper depth very similar to that\r\nused in the Whitehead torpedo.\r\n\r\nThe Sims-Edison torpedo differs from the Brennan in its greater\r\nobedience to orders and in its motive power being electrically\r\ntransmitted through a single connecting cable. It is over thirty feet\r\nin length and two feet in diameter. Attached to the torpedo proper by\r\nrods is a large copper float, furnished with balls to show the\r\noperator the path of the torpedo. The torpedo itself is in four parts:\r\nthe explosive head; the magazine of electric cables, which is paid out\r\nas the torpedo travels; the motor room; and the compartment containing\r\nthe steering-gear. The projectile has a high speed and long\r\nrange--over four thousand yards. It can twist and turn in any\r\ndirection, and, if need be, be called to heel. Like the Brennan, it\r\nhas the disadvantage of a long trailing wire, which could easily\r\nbecome entangled; and it might be put out of action by any damage\r\ninflicted on its float by the enemy’s guns. But it is likely to prove\r\na very effective harbour-guard if brought to the test.\r\n\r\nIn passing to the Orling-Armstrong torpedo we enter the latest phase\r\nof torpedo construction. Seeing the disadvantages arising from wires,\r\nelectricians have sought a means of controlling torpedoes without any\r\ntangible connection. Wireless telegraphy showed that such a means was\r\nnot beyond the bounds of possibility. Mr. Axel Orling, a Swede,\r\nworking in concert with Mr. J. T. Armstrong, has lately proved that a\r\ntorpedo can be steered by waves of energy transmitted along rays of\r\nlight, or perhaps it would be more correct to say along shafts of a\r\nform of X-rays.\r\n\r\nMr. Orling claims for his torpedo that it is capable of a speed of\r\ntwenty-two knots or more an hour; that it can be called to heel, and\r\nsteered to right or left at will; that as long as it is in sight it is\r\ncontrollable by rays invisible to the enemy; that not merely one, but\r\na number of torpedoes can be directed by the same beams of light;\r\nthat, as it is submerged, it would, even if detected, be a bad mark\r\nfor the enemy’s guns.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo carries a shaft which projects above the water, and bears\r\non its upper end a white disc to receive the rays and transmit them to\r\ninternal motors to be transmuted into driving power. The rod also\r\ncarries at night an electric light, shaded on the enemy’s side, but\r\nrendering the whereabouts of the torpedo very visible to the steerer.\r\n\r\nMr. Orling’s torpedo acts throughout in a cruelly calculating manner.\r\nBefore its attack a ship would derive small advantage from a crinoline\r\nof steel netting; for the large torpedo conceals in its head a smaller\r\ntorpedo, which, as soon as the netting is struck, darts out and blasts\r\nan opening through which its longer brother, after a momentary delay,\r\ncan easily follow. The netting penetrated, the torpedo has yet to\r\nstrike twice before exploding. On the first impact, a pin, projecting\r\nfrom the nose, is driven in to reverse the engines, and at the same\r\ntime a certain nut commences to travel along a screw. The nut having\r\nworked its way to the end of the thread, the head of the torpedo fills\r\nslowly through a valve, giving it a downward slant in front. The\r\nengines are again reversed and the nut again travels, this time\r\nbringing the head of the torpedo up, so as to strike the vessel at a\r\nvery effective angle from below.\r\n\r\nThis torpedo has passed beyond the experimental stage. It is reported\r\nthat by command of the Swedish Government, to whom Mr. Orling offered\r\nhis invention, and of the King, who takes a keen interest in the ideas\r\nof his young countryman, a number of experiments were some time ago\r\ncarried out in the Swedish rivers. Torpedoes were sent 2-1/2 miles,\r\ndirected as desired, and made to rise or sink--all this without any\r\ntangible connection. The Government was sufficiently satisfied with\r\nthe result to take up the patents, as furnishing a cheap means of\r\ndefending their coasts.\r\n\r\nMr. Orling has described what he imagines would happen in case of an\r\nattack on a position protected by his ingenious creations. “Suppose\r\nthat I had twelve torpedoes hidden away under ten feet of water in a\r\nconvenient little cove, and that I was directed to annihilate a\r\nhostile fleet just appearing above the horizon. Before me, on a little\r\ntable perhaps, I should have my apparatus; twelve buttons would be\r\nunder my fingers. Against each button there would be a description of\r\nthe torpedo to which it was connected; it would tell me its power of\r\ndestruction, and the power of its machinery, and for what distance it\r\nwould go. On each button, also, would be indicated the time that I\r\nmust press it to release the torpedoes. Well now, I perceive a large\r\nvessel in the van of the approaching fleet. I put my fingers on the\r\nbutton which is connected with my largest and most formidable weapon.\r\nI press the button--perhaps for twelve seconds. The torpedo is pushed\r\nforward from its fastenings by a special spring, a small pin is\r\nextracted from it, and immediately the motive machinery is set in\r\nmotion, and underneath the water goes my little agent of destruction,\r\nand there is nothing to tell the ship of its doom. I place my hand on\r\nanother button, and according to the time I press it I steer the\r\ntorpedo; the rudder answers to the rays, and the rays answer to the\r\nwill of my mind.”[2]\r\n\r\n     [2] _Pearson’s Magazine._\r\n\r\nIf this torpedo acts fully up to its author’s expectations, naval\r\nwarfare, at least as at present conducted, will be impossible. There\r\nappears to be no reason why this torpedo should not be worked from\r\nshipboard; and we cannot imagine that hostile ships possessing such\r\ntruly infernal machines would care to approach within miles of one\r\nanother, especially if the submarine be reinforced by the aërial\r\ntorpedo, different patterns of which are in course of construction by\r\nMr. Orling and Major Unge, a brother Swede. The Orling type will be\r\nworked by the new rays, strong enough to project it through space.\r\nMajor Unge’s will depend for its motive power upon a succession of\r\nimpulses obtained by the ignition of a slow-burning gas, passing\r\nthrough a turbine in the rear of the torpedo. The inventor hopes for a\r\nrange of at least six miles.\r\n\r\nWhat defence would be possible against such missiles? Liable to be\r\nshattered from below, or shivered from above, the warship will be\r\nplaced at an ever-increasing disadvantage. Its size will only render\r\nit an easier mark; its strength, bought at the expense of weight, will\r\nbe but the means of insuring a quicker descent to the sea’s bottom. Is\r\nit not probable that sea-fights will become more and more matters of a\r\nfew terrible, quickly-delivered blows? Human inventions will hold the\r\nbalance more and more evenly between nations of unequal size, first on\r\nsea, then on land, until at last, as we may hope, even the hottest\r\nheads and bravest hearts will shrink from courting what will be less\r\nwar than sheer annihilation, and war, man’s worst enemy, will be\r\nitself annihilated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE BOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of torpedoes for use against an enemy’s ships below\r\nthe waterline has led by natural stages to the evolution of a vessel\r\nwhich may approach unsuspected close enough to the object of attack to\r\ndischarge its missile effectively. Before the searchlight was adopted\r\na night surprise gave due concealment to small craft; but now that the\r\ngloom of midnight can be in an instant flooded with the brilliance of\r\nday a more subtle mode of attack becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nHence the genesis of the submarine or submersible boat, so constructed\r\nas to disappear beneath the sea at a safe distance from the doomed\r\nship, and when its torpedo has been sped to retrace its invisible\r\ncourse until outside the radius of destruction.\r\n\r\nTo this end many so-called submarine boats have been invented and\r\nexperimented with during recent years. The idea is an ancient one\r\nrevived, as indeed are the large proportion of our boasted modern\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nAristotle describes a vessel of this kind (a diving-bell rather than a\r\nboat, however), used in the siege of Tyre more than two thousand years\r\nago; and also refers to the divers being provided with an air-tube,\r\n“like the trunk of an elephant,” by means of which they drew a fresh\r\nsupply of air from above the surface--a contrivance adopted in more\r\nthan one of our modern submarines. Alexander the Great is said to have\r\nemployed divers in warfare; Pliny speaks of an ingenious diving\r\napparatus, and Bacon refers to air-tubes used by divers. We even find\r\ntraces of weapons of offence being employed. Calluvius is credited\r\nwith the invention of a submarine gun for projecting Greek fire.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Upsala in the sixteenth century gives a somewhat\r\nelaborate description of certain leather skiffs or boats used to\r\nscuttle ships by attacking them from beneath, two of which he claims\r\nto have personally examined. In 1629 we read that the Barbary corsairs\r\nfixed submarine torpedoes to the enemy’s keel by means of divers.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1579 an English gunner named William Bourne patented a\r\nsubmarine boat of his own invention fitted with leather joints, so\r\ncontrived as to be made smaller or larger by the action of screws,\r\nballasted with water, and having an air-pipe as mast. The Campbell-Ash\r\nsubmarine tried in 1885 was on much the same principle.\r\n\r\nCornelius van Drebbel, an ingenious Dutchman who settled in England\r\nbefore 1600, produced certain submersible vessels and obtained for\r\nthem the patronage of two kings. He claims to have discovered a means\r\nof re-oxygenating the foul air and so enabling his craft to remain a\r\nlong time below water; whether this was done by chemical treatment,\r\ncompressed air, or by surface tubes no record remains. Drebbel’s\r\nsuccess was such that he was allowed to experiment in the Thames, and\r\nJames I. accompanied him on one of his sub-aquatic journeys. In 1626\r\nCharles I. gave him an order to make “boates to go under water,” as\r\nwell as “water mines, water petards,” &c., presumably for the campaign\r\nagainst France, but we do not hear of these weapons of destruction\r\nbeing actually used upon this occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The “Holland” Submarine Boat._]\r\n\r\nThese early craft seem to have been generally moved by oars working in\r\nair-tight leather sockets; but one constructed at Rotterdam about 1654\r\nwas furnished with a paddle-wheel.\r\n\r\nComing now nearer to our own times, we find that an American called\r\nBushnell had a like inspiration in 1773, when he invented his famous\r\n“Turtles,” small, upright boats in which one man could sit, submerge\r\nhimself by means of leather bottles with the mouths projecting\r\noutside, propel himself with a small set of oars and steer with an\r\nelementary rudder. An unsuccessful attempt was made to blow up the\r\nEnglish fleet with one of these “Turtles” carrying a torpedo, but the\r\ncurrent proved too strong, and the missile exploded at a harmless\r\ndistance, the operator being finally rescued from an unpremeditated\r\nsea-trip! Bushnell was the author of the removable safety-keel now\r\nuniformly adopted.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards another New Englander took up the running, Fulton--one\r\nof the cleverest and least appreciated engineers of the early years\r\nof the nineteenth century. His _Nautilus_, built in the French\r\ndockyards, was in many respects the pattern for our own modern\r\nsubmarines. The cigar-shaped copper hull, supported by iron ribs, was\r\ntwenty-four feet four inches long, with a greatest diameter of seven\r\nfeet. Propulsion came from a wheel, rotated by a hand winch, in the\r\ncentre of the stern; forward was a small conning-tower, and the boat\r\nwas steered by a rudder. There was a detachable keel below; and fitted\r\ninto groves on the top were a collapsible mast and sail for use on the\r\nsurface of the water. An anchor was also carried externally. In spite\r\nof the imperfect materials at his disposal Fulton had much success. At\r\nBrest he took a crew of three men twenty-five feet down, and on\r\nanother day blew up an old hulk. In the Seine two men went down for\r\ntwenty minutes and steered back to their starting-point under water.\r\nHe also put in air at high pressure and remained submerged for hours.\r\nBut France, England, and his own country in turn rejected his\r\ninvention; and, completely discouraged, he bent his energies to\r\ndesigning boat engines instead.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Captain Johnson, also an American, made a submersible vessel\r\n100 feet long, designed to fetch Napoleon from St. Helena, travelling\r\nfor the most part upon the surface. This expedition never came off.\r\n\r\nTwo later inventions, by Castera and Payerne, in 1827 and 1846\r\nrespectively, were intended for more peaceful objects. Being\r\nfurnished with diving-chambers, the occupants could retrieve things\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea; Castera providing his boat with an\r\nair-tube to the surface.\r\n\r\nBauer, another inventor, lived for some years in England under the\r\npatronage of Prince Albert, who supplied him with funds for his\r\nexperiments. With Brunel’s help he built a vessel which was\r\nindiscreetly modified by the naval authorities, and finally sank and\r\ndrowned its crew. Going then to Russia he constructed sundry\r\nsubmarines for the navy; but was in the end thrown over, and, like\r\nFulton, had to turn himself to other employment.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that up to this period the cry for a practical submarine\r\nto use in warfare had not yet arisen, or these inventions would have\r\nmet with a far different reception. Within the last half century all\r\nhas changed. America and France now rival each other in construction,\r\nwhile the other nations of Europe look on with intelligent interest,\r\nand in turn make their contributions towards solving the problem of\r\nunder-wave propulsion.\r\n\r\nAmerica led the way during the Civil War blockades in 1864, when the\r\n_Housatonic_ was sunk in Charleston harbour, and damage done to other\r\nships. But these experimental torpedo-boats were clumsy contrivances\r\ncompared with their modern successors, for they could only carry their\r\ndestructive weapon at the end of a spar projecting from the bows--to\r\nbe exploded upon contact with the obstacle, and probably involve the\r\naggressor in a common ruin. So nothing more was done till the\r\nperfecting of the Whitehead torpedo (see Dirigible Torpedoes) gave the\r\nrequired impetus to fresh enterprise.\r\n\r\nFrance, experimenting in the same direction, produced in 1889 Goubet’s\r\nsubmarine, patent of a private inventor, who has also been patronised\r\nby other navies. These are very small boats, the first, 16-1/2 feet\r\nlong, carrying a crew of two or three men. _Goubet No. 2_, built in\r\n1899, is 26-1/4 feet long, composed of several layers of gun-metal\r\nunited by strong screw-bolts, and so able to resist very great\r\npressure. They are egg-or spindle-shaped, supplied with compressed\r\nair, able to sink and rise by rearrangement of water-ballast.\r\nReservoirs in the hull are gradually filled for submersion with water,\r\nwhich is easily expelled when it is desired to rise again. If this\r\nsystem goes wrong a false keel of thirty-six hundredweight can be\r\ndetached and the boat springs up to the surface. The propulsive force\r\nis electricity, which works the driving-screw at the rear, and the\r\nautomobile torpedo is discharged from its tube by compressed air.\r\n\r\n“By the aid of an optical tube, which a pneumatic telescopic apparatus\r\nenables the operator to thrust above the surface and pull down in a\r\nmoment, the captain of the _Goubet_ can, when near the surface, see\r\nwhat is going on all round him. This telescope has a system of prisms\r\nand lenses which cause the image of the sea-surface to be deflected\r\ndown to the eye of the observer below.\r\n\r\n“Fresh air for the crew is provided by reservoirs of oxygen, and\r\naccumulations of foul air can be expelled by means of a small pump.\r\nEnough fresh air can be compressed into the reservoirs to last the\r\ncrew for a week or more.”\r\n\r\nThe _Gymnote_, laid down in 1898, is more than double the size of the\r\n_Goubet_; it is cigar-shaped, 29 feet long by 6 feet diameter, with a\r\ndisplacement of thirty tons. The motive power is also electricity\r\nstored in accumulators for use during submersion, and the speed\r\nexpected--but not realised--was to be ten knots.\r\n\r\nFive years later this type was improved upon in the _Gustave Zédé_,\r\nthe largest submarine ever yet designed. This boat, built of\r\nphosphor-bronze, with a single screw, measures 131 feet in length and\r\nhas a displacement of 266 tons; she can contain a crew of nine\r\nofficers and men, carries three torpedoes--though with one torpedo\r\ntube instead of two--has a lightly armoured conning-tower, and is said\r\nto give a surface speed of thirteen knots and to make eight knots when\r\nsubmerged. At a trial of her powers made in the presence of M.\r\nLockroy, Minister of Marine, she affixed an unloaded torpedo to the\r\nbattleship _Magenta_ and got away unobserved. The whole performance of\r\nthe boat on that occasion was declared to be most successful. But its\r\ncost proved excessive considering the small radius of action\r\nobtainable, and a smaller vessel of the same type, the _Morse_ (118 ×\r\n9 feet), is now the official size for that particular class.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 a competition was held and won by the submersible _Narval_ of\r\nM. Laubeuf, a craft shaped much like the ordinary torpedo-boat. On the\r\nsurface or awash the _Narval_ works by means of a Brulé engine burning\r\noil fuel to heat its boilers; but when submerged for attack with\r\nfunnel shut down is driven by electric accumulators. She displaces 100\r\nodd tons and is provided with four Dzewiecki torpedo tubes. Her radius\r\nof action, steaming awash, is calculated at some 250 miles, or seventy\r\nmiles when proceeding under water at five knots an hour. This is the\r\nparent of another class of boats designed for offensive tactics, while\r\nthe _Morse_ type is adapted chiefly for coast and harbour defence. The\r\nFrench navy includes altogether thirty submarine craft, though several\r\nof these are only projected at present, and none have yet been put to\r\nthe practical tests of actual warfare--the torpedoes used in\r\nexperimenting being, of course, blank.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in America experiments have also been proceeding since 1887,\r\nwhen Mr. Holland of New York produced the vessel that bears his name.\r\nThis, considerably modified, has now been adopted as model by our Navy\r\nDepartment, which is building some half-dozen on very similar lines.\r\nThough it is not easy to get any definite particulars concerning\r\nFrench submarines Americans are less reticent, and we have graphic\r\naccounts of the _Holland_ and her offspring from those who have\r\nvisited her.\r\n\r\nThese vessels, though cigar-shaped liked most others, in some respects\r\nresemble the _Narval_, being intended for long runs on the surface,\r\nwhen they burn oil in a four-cylinder gasolene engine of 160\r\nhorse-power. Under water they are propelled by an electric waterproof\r\nmotor of seventy horse-power, and proceed at a pace of seven knots per\r\nhour. There is a superstructure for deck, with a funnel for the engine\r\nand a small conning-tower protected by 4-inch armour. The armament\r\ncarried comprises five 18-inch Whitehead torpedoes, 11 feet 8 inches\r\nlong. One hundred and twenty tons is the displacement, including tank\r\ncapacity for 850 gallons of gasolene; the full length is 63 feet 4\r\ninches, with a beam of 11 feet 9 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _An interior view of the “Holland.” The large pendulum\r\non the right actuates mechanism to keep the Submarine at the required\r\ndepth below the surface._]\r\n\r\nThe original Holland boat is thus described by an adventurous\r\ncorrespondent who took a trip in her[3]: “The _Holland_ is fifty-three\r\nfeet long, and in its widest part it is 10-1/4 feet in diameter. It\r\nhas a displacement of seventy-four tons, and what is called a reserve\r\nbuoyancy of 2-1/2 tons which tends to make it come to the surface.\r\n\r\n     [3] _Pearson’s Magazine._\r\n\r\n“The frames of the boat are exact circles of steel. They are set a\r\nlittle more than a foot apart. They diminish gradually in diameter\r\nfrom the centre of the boat to the bow and stern. On the top of the\r\nboat a flat superstructure is built to afford a walking platform, and\r\nunder this are spaces for exhaust pipes and for the external outfit of\r\nthe boat, such as ropes and a small anchor. The steel plates which\r\ncover the frame are from one-half to three-eighths of an inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n“From what may be called the centre of the boat a turret extends\r\nupwards through the superstructure for about eighteen inches. It is\r\ntwo feet in diameter, and is the only means of entrance to the boat.\r\nIt is the place from which the boat is operated. At the stern is an\r\nordinary three-bladed propeller and an ordinary rudder, and in\r\naddition there are two horizontal rudders--“diving-rudders” they are\r\ncalled--which look like the feet of a duck spread out behind as it\r\nswims along the water.\r\n\r\n“From the bow two-thirds of the way to the stern there is a flooring,\r\nbeneath which are the storage batteries, the tank for the gasolene,\r\nand the tanks which are filled with water for submerging; in the last\r\none-third of the boat the flooring drops away, and the space is\r\noccupied by the propelling machinery.\r\n\r\n“There are about a dozen openings in the boat, the chief being three\r\nKingston valves, by means of which the submerging tanks are filled or\r\nemptied. Others admit water to pressure gauges, which regulate or show\r\nthe depth of the vessel under water. There are twelve deadlights in\r\nthe top and sides of the craft. To remain under water the boat must be\r\nkept in motion, unless an anchor is used.\r\n\r\n“It can be steered to the surface by the diving rudders, or sent\r\nflying to the top through emptying the storage tanks. If it strikes\r\nbottom, or gets stuck in the mud, it can blow itself loose by means of\r\nits compressed air. It cannot be sunk unless pierced above the\r\nflooring. It has a speed capacity of from eight to ten knots either\r\non the surface or under water.\r\n\r\n“It can go 1500 miles on the surface without renewing its supply of\r\ngasolene. It can go fully forty knots under water without coming to\r\nthe surface, and there is enough compressed air in the tanks to supply\r\na crew with fresh air for thirty hours, if the air is not used for any\r\nother purpose, such as emptying the submerging tanks. It can dive to a\r\ndepth of twenty feet in eight seconds.\r\n\r\n“The interior is simply packed with machinery. As you climb down the\r\nturret you are confronted with it at once. There is a diminutive\r\ncompass which must be avoided carefully by the feet. A pressure gauge\r\nis directly in front of the operator’s eye as he stands in position.\r\nThere are speaking-tubes to various parts of the boat, and a\r\nsignal-bell to the engine-room.\r\n\r\n“As the operator’s hands hang by his sides, he touches a wheel on the\r\nport side, by turning which he steers the little vessel, and one on\r\nthe starboard side, by turning which he controls the diving machinery.\r\nAfter the top is clamped down the operator can look out through\r\nplate-glass windows, about one inch wide and three inches long, which\r\nencircle the turret.\r\n\r\n“So long as the boat is running on the surface these are valuable,\r\ngiving a complete view of the surroundings if the water is smooth.\r\nAfter the boat goes beneath the surface, these windows are useless; it\r\nis impossible to see through the water. Steering must be done by\r\ncompass; until recently considered an impossible task in a submarine\r\nboat. A tiny electric light in the turret shows the operator the\r\ndirection in which he is going, and reveals the markings on the depth\r\ngauges. If the boat should pass under an object, such as a ship, a\r\nperceptible shadow would be noticed through the deadlights, but that\r\nis all. The ability to see fishes swimming about in the water is a\r\npleasant fiction.\r\n\r\n“The only clear space in the body of the boat is directly in front of\r\nthe bench on which the man in the turret is standing. It is where the\r\neighteen-inch torpedo-tube, and the eight and five-eighths inch aërial\r\ngun are loaded.\r\n\r\n“Along the sides of this open space are six compressed-air tanks,\r\ncontaining thirty cubic feet of air at a pressure of 2000 lbs. to a\r\nsquare inch. Near by is a smaller tank, containing three cubic feet of\r\nair at a fifty pounds pressure. A still smaller tank contains two\r\ncubic feet of air at a ten pounds pressure. These smaller tanks supply\r\nthe compressed air which, with the smokeless powder, is used in\r\ndischarging the projectiles from the boat.\r\n\r\n“Directly behind the turret, up against the roof on the port side, is\r\nthe little engine by which the vessel is steered; it is worked by\r\ncompressed air. Fastened to the roof on the starboard side is the\r\ndiving-engine, with discs that look as large as dinner-plates stood on\r\nend. These discs are diaphragms on which the water-pressure exerts an\r\ninfluence, counteracting certain springs which are set to keep the\r\ndiving rudders at a given pitch, and thus insuring an immersion of an\r\nexact depth during a run.\r\n\r\n“At one side is a cubic steel box--the air compressor; and directly in\r\nthe centre of this part of the boat is a long pendulum, just as there\r\nis in the ordinary torpedo, which, by swinging backwards and forwards\r\nas the boat dives and rises, checks a tendency to go too far down, or\r\nto come up at too sharp an angle. On the floor are the levers which,\r\nwhen raised and moved in certain directions, fill or empty the\r\nsubmerging tanks. On every hand are valves and wheels and pipes in\r\nsuch apparent confusion as to turn a layman’s head.\r\n\r\n“There are also pumps in the boat, a ventilating apparatus, and a\r\nsounding contrivance, by means of which the channel is picked out when\r\nrunning under water. This sounding contrivance consists of a heavy\r\nweight attached to a piano wire passing from a reel out through a\r\nstuffing-box in the bottom. There are also valves which release fresh\r\nair to the crew, although in ordinary runs of from one-half to one\r\nhour this is not necessary, the fresh air received from the various\r\nexhausts in the boat being sufficient to supply all necessities in\r\nthat length of time.”\r\n\r\nAnother submersible of somewhat different design is the production of\r\nthe Swedish inventor, Mr. Nordenfelt. This boat is 9-1/2 metres in\r\nlength, and has a displacement of sixty tons. Like the _Goubet_ it\r\nsinks only in a horizontal position, while the _Holland_ plunges\r\ndownward at a slight angle. On the surface a steam-engine of 100\r\nhorse-power propels it, and when the funnel is closed down and the\r\nvessel submerges itself, the screws are still driven by superheated\r\nsteam from the large reservoir of water boiling at high pressure which\r\nmaintains a constant supply, three circulation pumps keeping this in\r\ntouch with the boiler. The plunge is accomplished by means of two\r\nprotected screws, and when they cease to move the reserve buoyancy of\r\nthe boat brings it back to the surface. It is steered by a rudder\r\nwhich a pendulum regulates. The most modern of these boats is of\r\nEnglish manufacture, built at Barrow, and tried in Southampton Water.\r\n\r\nThe vessels hitherto described should be termed submersible rather\r\nthan submarine, as they are designed to usually proceed on the\r\nsurface, and submerge themselves only for action when in sight of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAmerican ingenuity has produced an absolutely unique craft to which\r\nthe name submarine may with real appropriateness be applied, for,\r\nsinking in water 100 feet deep, it can remain below and run upon three\r\nwheels along the bottom of the sea. This is the _Argonaut_, invented\r\nby Mr. Simon Lake of Baltimore, and its main portion consists of a\r\nsteel framework of cylindrical form which is surmounted by a flat,\r\nhollow steel deck. During submersion the deck is filled with water and\r\nthus saved from being crushed by outside pressure as well as helping\r\nto sink the craft.\r\n\r\nWhen moving on the surface it has the appearance of an ordinary ship,\r\nwith its two light masts, a small conning-tower on which is the\r\nsteering-wheel, bowsprit, ventilators, a derrick, suction-pump, and\r\ntwo anchors. A gasolene engine of special design is used for both\r\nsurface and submerged cruising under ordinary circumstances, but in\r\ntime of war storage batteries are available. An electric dynamo\r\nsupplies light to the whole interior, including a 4000 candle-power\r\nsearchlight in the extreme bow which illuminates the pathway while\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\nOn the boat being stopped and the order given to submerge, the crew\r\nfirst throw out sounding lines to make sure of the depth. They then\r\nclose down external openings, and retreat into the boat through the\r\nconning-tower, within which the helmsman takes his stand, continuing\r\nto steer as easily as when outside. The valves which fill the deck and\r\nsubmersion tanks are opened, and the _Argonaut_ drops gently to the\r\nfloor of the ocean. The two apparent masts are in reality 3-inch iron\r\npipes which rise thirty feet or more above the deck, and so long as no\r\ngreater depth is attained, they supply the occupants with fresh air\r\nand let exhausted gases escape, but close automatically when the water\r\nreaches their top.\r\n\r\nOnce upon the bottom of the sea this versatile submarine begins its\r\njourney as a tricycle. It is furnished with a driving-wheel on either\r\nside, each of which is 6-1/2 feet in diameter and weighs 5000 lbs.;\r\nand is guided by a third wheel weighing 2000 lbs. journalled in the\r\nrudder. On a hard bottom or against a strong tide the wheels are most\r\neffective owing to their weight, but in passing through soft sand or\r\nmud the screw propeller pushes the boat along, the driving-wheels\r\nrunning “loose.” In this way she can travel through even waist-deep\r\nmud, the screw working more strongly than on the surface, because it\r\nhas such a weight of water to help it, and she moves more easily\r\nuphill.\r\n\r\nIn construction the _Argonaut_ is shaped something like a huge cigar,\r\nher strong steel frames, spaced twenty inches apart, being clad with\r\nsteel plates 3/8-inch thick double riveted over them. Great strength\r\nis necessary to resist the pressure of superincumbent water, which at\r\na depth of 100 feet amounts to 44 lbs. per square inch.\r\n\r\nOriginally she was built 36 feet long, but was subsequently lengthened\r\nby some 20 odd feet, and has 9 feet beam. She weighs fifty-seven tons\r\nwhen submerged. A false section of keel, 4000 lbs. in weight, can on\r\nemergency be instantly released from inside; and two downhaul weights,\r\neach of 1000 lbs., are used as an extra precaution for safety when\r\nsinking in deep water.\r\n\r\nThe interior is divided into various compartments, the living quarters\r\nconsisting of the cabin, galley, operating chamber and engine-room.\r\nThere are also a division containing stores and telephone, the\r\nintermediate, and the divers’ room. The “operating” room contains the\r\nlevers, handwheels, and other mechanism by which the boat’s movements\r\nare governed. A water gauge shows her exact depth below the surface; a\r\ndial on either side indicates any inclination from the horizontal.\r\nCertain levers open the valves which admit water to the ballast-tanks\r\nin the hold; another releases the false keel; there is a cyclometer to\r\nregister the wheel travelling, and other gauges mark the pressure of\r\nsteam, speed of engines, &c.\r\n\r\nA compass in the conning-tower enables the navigator to steer a true\r\ncourse whether above or below the surface. This conning-tower, only\r\nsix feet high, rises above the centre of the living quarters, and is\r\nof steel with small windows in the upper part. Encircling it to about\r\nthree-quarters of its height is a reservoir for gasolene, which feeds\r\ninto a smaller tank within the boat for consumption. The compressed\r\nair is stored in two Mannesmann steel reservoirs which have been\r\ntested to a pressure of 4000 lbs. per square inch. This renews the\r\nair-supply for the crew when the _Argonaut_ is long below, and also\r\nenables the diving operations to be carried on.\r\n\r\nThe maximum speed at which the _Argonaut_ travels submerged is five\r\nknots an hour, and when she has arrived at her destination--say a\r\nsunken coal steamer--the working party pass into the “intermediate”\r\nchamber, whose air-tight doors are then closed. A current of\r\ncompressed air is then turned on until the air is equal in pressure to\r\nthat in the divers’ room. The doors of this close over india rubber to\r\nbe air and water-tight; one communicates with the “intermediate,” the\r\nother is a trap which opens downwards into the sea. Through three\r\nwindows in the prow those remaining in the room can watch operations\r\noutside within a radius varying according to the clearness of the\r\nwater. The divers assume their suits, to the helmets of which a\r\ntelephone is attached, so arranged that they are able to talk to each\r\nother as well as to those in the boat. They are also provided with\r\nelectric lamps, and a brilliant flood of light streams upon them from\r\nthe bows of the vessel. The derrick can be used with ease under water,\r\nand the powerful suction-pump will “retrieve” coal from a submerged\r\nvessel into a barge above at the rate of sixty tons per hour.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen how valuable a boat of this kind may be for\r\nsalvage operations, as well as for surveying the bottom of harbours,\r\nriver mouths, sea coasts, and so on. In war time it can lay or examine\r\nsubmarine mines for harbour defence, or, if employed offensively, can\r\nenter the enemy’s harbour with no chance of detection, and there\r\ndestroy his mines or blow up his ships with perfect impunity.\r\n\r\nTo return the _Argonaut_ to the surface it is only necessary to force\r\ncompressed air into the space below the deck and the four tanks in the\r\nhold. Her buoyancy being thus gradually restored she rises slowly and\r\nsteadily till she is again afloat upon the water, and steams for land.\r\n\r\nWe have now glanced briefly at some of the most interesting\r\nattempts--out of many dozens--to produce a practicable submarine\r\nvessel in bygone days; and have inquired more closely into the\r\nconstruction of several modern designs; among these the _Holland_ has\r\nreceived especial attention, as that is the model adopted by our\r\nAdmiralty, and our own new boats only differ in detail from their\r\nAmerican prototype. But before quitting this subject it will be well\r\nto consider what is required from the navigating engineer, and how far\r\npresent invention has supplied the demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The “Holland” Submarine in the last stages of\r\nsubmersion._]\r\n\r\nThe perfect submarine of fiction was introduced by Jules Verne, whose\r\n_Nautilus_ remains a masterpiece of scientific imagination. This\r\nmarvellous vessel ploughed the seas with equal power and safety,\r\nwhether on the surface or deeply sunk beneath the waves, bearing the\r\npressure of many atmospheres. It would rest upon the ocean floor while\r\nits inmates, clad in diving suits, issued forth to stroll amid aquatic\r\nforests and scale marine mountains. It gathered fabulous treasures\r\nfrom pearl beds and sunken galleons; and could ram and sink an\r\noffending ship a thousand times its size without dinting or loosening\r\na plate on its own hull. No weather deflected its compass, no movement\r\ndisturbed its equilibrium. Its crew followed peacefully and cheerfully\r\nin their spacious cabins a daily round of duties which electric power\r\nand automatic gear reduced to a minimum. Save for the misadventure of\r\na shortened air-supply when exploring the Polar pack, and the clash of\r\nhuman passions, Captain Nemo’s guests would have voyaged in a\r\nfloating paradise.\r\n\r\nCompare with this entrancing creation the most practical vessels of\r\nactual experiment. They are small, blind craft, groping their way\r\nperilously when below the surface, the steel and electrical machinery\r\nsadly interfering with any trustworthy working of their compass, and\r\nthe best form of periscope hitherto introduced forming a very\r\nimperfect substitute for ordinary vision.\r\n\r\nTheir speed, never very fast upon the surface, is reduced by\r\nsubmersion to that of the oldest and slowest gunboats. Their radius of\r\naction is also circumscribed--that is, they cannot carry supplies\r\nsufficient to go a long distance, deal with a hostile fleet, and then\r\nreturn to headquarters without replenishment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there arise the nice questions of buoyancy combined with\r\nstability when afloat, of sinking quickly out of sight, and of keeping\r\na correct balance under water. The equilibrium of such small vessels\r\nnavigating between the surface and the bottom is extremely sensitive;\r\neven the movements to and fro of the crew are enough to imperil them.\r\nTo meet this difficulty the big water-ballast tanks, engines and\r\naccumulators are necessarily arranged at the bottom of the hull, and a\r\npendulum working a helm automatically is introduced to keep it\r\nlongitudinally stable.\r\n\r\nTo sink the boat, which is done by changing the angle of the\r\npropeller in the _Goubet_ and some others, and by means of horizontal\r\nrudders and vanes in the _Nordenfelt_ and _Holland_, it must first be\r\nmost accurately balanced, bow and stern exactly in trim. Then the boat\r\nmust be put into precise equilibrium with the water--_i.e._ must weigh\r\njust the amount of water displaced. For this its specific gravity must\r\nbe nearly the same as that of the water (whether salt or fresh), and a\r\nsmall accident might upset all calculations. Collision, even with a\r\nlarge fish, could destroy the steering-gear, and a dent in the side\r\nwould also tend to plunge it at once to destruction.\r\n\r\nDid it escape these dangers and succeed in steering an accurate course\r\nto its goal, we have up to now little practical proof that the mere\r\nact of discharging its torpedo--though the weight of the missile is\r\nintended to be automatically replaced immediately it drops from the\r\ntube--may not suffice to send the vessel either to bottom or top of\r\nthe sea. In the latter case it would be within the danger zone of its\r\nalarmed enemy and at his mercy, its slow speed (even if uninjured)\r\nleaving it little chance of successful flight.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the final result, one thing is certain, that--untried as\r\nit is--the possible contingency of a submarine attack is likely to\r\nshake the _morale_ of an aggressive fleet.\r\n\r\n“When the first submarine torpedo-boat goes into action,” says Mr.\r\nHolland, “she will bring us face to face with the most perplexing\r\nproblem ever met in warfare. She will present the unique spectacle,\r\nwhen used in attack, of a weapon against which there is no defence....\r\nYou can send nothing against the submarine boat, not even itself....\r\nYou cannot see under water, hence you cannot fight under water. Hence\r\nyou cannot defend yourself against an attack under water except by\r\nrunning away.”\r\n\r\nThis inventor is, however, an enthusiast about the future awaiting the\r\nsubmarine as a social factor. His boat has been tested by long voyages\r\non and below water with complete success. The _Argonaut_ also upon one\r\noccasion travelled a thousand miles with five persons, and proved\r\nherself “habitable, seaworthy, and under perfect control.”\r\n\r\nMr. Holland confidently anticipates in the near future a Channel\r\nservice of submerged boats run by automatic steering-gear upon cables\r\nstretched from coast to coast, and eloquently sums up its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe passage would be always practicable, for ordinary interruptions\r\nsuch as fog and storms cannot affect the sea depths.\r\n\r\nAn even temperature would prevail summer and winter, the well-warmed\r\nand lighted boats being also free from smoke and spray.\r\n\r\nNo nauseating smells would proceed from the evenly-working electric\r\nengines. No motion cause sea-sickness, no collision be apprehended--as\r\neach line would run on its own cable, and at its own specified depth,\r\na telephone keeping it in communication with shore.\r\n\r\nIn like manner a service might be plied over lake bottoms, or across\r\nthe bed of wide rivers whose surface is bound in ice. Such is the\r\nsubmarine boat as hitherto conceived for peace or war--a daring\r\nproject for the coming generation to justify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMATED PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas it ever occurred to the reader to ask himself why rain appears to\r\nfall in streaks though it arrives at earth in drops? Or why the\r\nglowing end of a charred stick produces fiery lines if waved about in\r\nthe darkness? Common sense tells us the drop and the burning point\r\ncannot _be_ in two places at one and the same time. And yet apparently\r\nwe are able to see both in many positions simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis seeming paradox is due to “persistence of vision,” a phenomenon\r\nthat has attracted the notice of scientific men for many centuries.\r\nPersistence may be briefly explained thus:--\r\n\r\nThe eye is extremely sensitive to light, and will, as is proved by the\r\nvisibility of the electric spark, lasting for less than the millionth\r\npart of a second, _receive_ impressions with marvellous rapidity.\r\n\r\nBut it cannot get rid of these impressions at the same speed. The\r\nduration of a visual impression has been calculated as one-tenth to\r\none-twenty-first of a second. The electric spark, therefore, appears\r\nto last much longer than it really does.\r\n\r\nHence it is obvious that if a series of impressions follow one another\r\nmore rapidly than the eye can free itself of them, the impressions\r\nwill overlap, and one of four results will follow.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) _Apparently uninterrupted presence_ of an image if the\r\n     same image be repeatedly represented.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) _Confusion_, if the images be all different and\r\n     disconnected.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) _Combination_, if the images of two or a very few objects\r\n     be presented in regular rotation.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) _Motion_, if the objects be similar in all but one part,\r\n     which occupies a slightly different portion in each\r\n     presentation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with (_c_) an interesting story is told of Sir J.\r\nHerschel by Charles Babbage:--[4]\r\n\r\n     [4] Quoted from Mr. Henry V. Hopwood’s “Living Pictures,” to\r\n     which book the author is indebted for much of his information\r\n     in this chapter.\r\n\r\n“One day Herschel, sitting with me after dinner, amusing himself by\r\nspinning a pear upon the table, suddenly asked whether I could show\r\nhim the two sides of a shilling at the same moment. I took out of my\r\npocket a shilling, and holding it up before the looking-glass, pointed\r\nout my method. ‘No,’ said my friend, ‘that won’t do;’ then spinning my\r\nshilling upon the table, he pointed out his method of seeing both\r\nsides at once. The next day I mentioned the anecdote to the late Dr.\r\nFitton, who a few days after brought me a beautiful illustration of\r\nthe principle. It consisted of a round disc of card suspended between\r\ntwo pieces of sewing silk. These threads being held between the finger\r\nand thumb of each hand, were then made to turn quickly, when the disc\r\nof card, of course, revolved also. Upon one side of this disc of card\r\nwas painted a bird, upon the other side an empty bird-cage. On turning\r\nthe thread rapidly the bird appeared to have got inside the cage. We\r\nsoon made numerous applications, as a rat on one side and a trap on\r\nthe other, &c. It was shown to Captain Kater, Dr. Wollaston, and many\r\nof our friends, and was, after the lapse of a short time, forgotten.\r\nSome months after, during dinner at the Royal Society Club, Sir Joseph\r\nBanks being in the chair, I heard Mr. Barrow, then secretary to the\r\nAdmiralty, talking very loudly about a wonderful invention of Dr.\r\nParis, the object of which I could not quite understand. It was called\r\nthe Thaumatrope, and was said to be sold at the Royal Institution, in\r\nAlbemarle Street. Suspecting that it had some connection with our\r\nunnamed toy I went next morning and purchased for seven shillings and\r\nsixpence a thaumatrope, which I afterwards sent down to Slough to the\r\nlate Lady Herschel. It was precisely the thing which her son and Dr.\r\nFitton had contributed to invent, which amused all their friends for a\r\ntime, and had then been forgotten.”\r\n\r\nThe _thaumatrope_, then, did nothing more than illustrate the power of\r\nthe eye to weld together a couple of alternating impressions. The toys\r\nto which we shall next pass represent the same principle working in a\r\ndifferent direction towards the production of the living picture.\r\n\r\nNow, when we see a man running (to take an instance) we see the _same_\r\nbody and the same legs continuously, but in different positions, which\r\nmerge insensibly the one into the other. No method of reproducing that\r\nimpression of motion is possible if only _one_ drawing, diagram, or\r\nphotograph be employed.\r\n\r\nA man represented with as many legs as a centipede would not give us\r\nany impression of running or movement; and a blur showing the\r\npositions taken successively by his legs would be equally futile.\r\nTherefore we are driven back to a _series_ of pictures, slightly\r\ndifferent from one another; and in order that the pictures may not be\r\nblurred a screen must be interposed before the eye while the change\r\nfrom picture to picture is made. The shorter the period of change, and\r\nthe greater the number of pictures presented to illustrate a single\r\nmotion, the more realistic is the effect. These are the general\r\nprinciples which have to be observed in all mechanism for the\r\nproduction of an illusory effect of motion. The persistence of vision\r\nhas led to the invention of many optical toys, the names of which, in\r\ncommon with the names of most apparatus connected with the living\r\npicture, are remarkable for their length. Of these toys we will select\r\nthree for special notice.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Plateau of Ghent invented the _phenakistoscope_, “the thing\r\nthat gives one a false impression of reality”--to interpret this\r\nformidable word. The phenakistoscope is a disc of card or metal round\r\nthe edge of which are drawn a succession of pictures showing a man or\r\nanimal in progressive positions. Between every two pictures a narrow\r\nslit is cut. The disc is mounted on an axle and revolved before a\r\nmirror, so that a person looking through the slits see one picture\r\nafter another reflected in the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe _zoetrope_, or Wheel of Life, which appeared first in 1860, is a\r\nmodification of the same idea. In this instrument the pictures are\r\narranged on the inner side of a hollow cylinder revolving on a\r\nvertical axis, its sides being perforated with slits above the\r\npictures. As the slit in both cases caused distortion M. Reynaud, a\r\nFrenchman, produced in 1877 the _praxinoscope_, which differed from\r\nthe zoetrope in that the pictures were not seen directly through\r\nslits, but were reflected by mirrors set half-way between the pictures\r\nand the axis of the cylinder, a mirror for every picture. Only at the\r\nmoment when the mirror is at right angles to the line of sight would\r\nthe picture be visible. M. Reynaud also devised a special lantern for\r\nprojecting praxinoscope pictures on to a screen.\r\n\r\nThese and other somewhat similar contrivances, though ingenious, had\r\nvery distinct limitations. They depended for their success upon the\r\ninventiveness and accuracy of the artist, who was confined in his\r\nchoice of subject; and could, owing to the construction of the\r\napparatus, only represent a small series of actions, indefinitely\r\nrepeated by the machine. And as a complete action had to be crowded\r\ninto a few pictures, the changes of position were necessarily abrupt.\r\n\r\nTo make the living picture a success two things were needed; some\r\nmethod of securing a very rapid series of many pictures, and a machine\r\nfor reproducing the series, whatever its length. The method was found\r\nin photography, with the advance of which the living picture’s\r\nprogress is so closely related, that it will be worth while to notice\r\nbriefly the various improvements of photographic processes. The\r\nold-fashioned Daguerreotype process, discovered in 1839, required an\r\nexposure of half-an-hour. The introduction of wet collodion reduced\r\nthis tax on a sitter’s patience to ten seconds. In 1878 the dry plate\r\nprocess had still further shortened the exposure to one second; and\r\nsince that date the silver-salt emulsions used in photography have had\r\ntheir sensitiveness to light so much increased, that clear pictures\r\ncan now be made in one-thousandth of a second, a period minute enough\r\nto arrest the most rapid movements of animals.\r\n\r\nBy 1878, therefore, instantaneous photography was ready to aid the\r\nliving picture. Previously to that year series of photographs had been\r\ntaken from posed models, without however extending the choice of\r\nsubjects to any great extent. But between 1870 and 1880 two men, Marey\r\nand Muybridge, began work with the camera on the movements of horses.\r\nMarey endeavoured to produce a series of pictures round the edge of\r\none plate with a single lens and repeated exposures.[5] Muybridge, on\r\nthe other hand, used a series of cameras. He erected a long white\r\nbackground parallel to which were stationed the cameras at equal\r\ndistances. The shutters of the cameras were connected to threads laid\r\nacross the interval between the background and the cameras in such a\r\nmanner that a horse driven along the track snapped them at regular\r\nintervals, and brought about successive exposures. Muybridge’s method\r\nwas carried on by Anschütz, a German, who in 1899 brought out his\r\nelectrical Tachyscope, or “quick-seer.” Having secured his negatives\r\nhe printed off transparent positives on glass, and arranged these last\r\nround the circumference of a large disc rotating in front of a screen,\r\nhaving in it a hole the size of the transparencies. As each picture\r\ncame opposite the hole a Geissler tube was momentarily lit up behind\r\nit by electrical contact, giving a fleeting view of one phase of a\r\nhorse’s motion.\r\n\r\n     [5] A very interesting article in the May, 1902, issue of\r\n     _Pearson’s Magazine_ deals with the latest work of Professor\r\n     Marey in the field of the photographic representation of the\r\n     movements of men, birds, and quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the ribbon film in or about 1888 opened much\r\ngreater possibilities to the living picture than would ever have\r\nexisted had the glass plate been retained. It was now comparatively\r\neasy to take a long series of pictures; and accordingly we find\r\nMessrs. Friese-Greene and Evans exhibiting in 1890 a camera capable of\r\nsecuring three hundred exposures in half a minute, or ten per second.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next apparatus to be specially mentioned is Edison’s Kinetoscope,\r\nwhich he first exhibited in England in 1894. As early as 1887 Mr.\r\nEdison had tried to produce animated pictures in a manner analogous to\r\nthe making of a sound-record on a phonograph (see p. 56). He wrapped\r\nround a cylinder a sheet of sensitized celluloid which was covered,\r\nafter numerous exposures, by a spiral line of tiny negatives. The\r\npositives made from these were illuminated in turn by flashes of\r\nelectric light. This method was, however, entirely abandoned in the\r\nperfected kinetoscope, an instrument for viewing pictures the size of\r\na postage stamp, carried on a continuously moving celluloid film\r\nbetween the eye of the observer and a small electric lamp. The\r\npictures passed the point of inspection at the rate of forty-six per\r\nsecond (a rate hitherto never approached), and as each picture was\r\nproperly centred a slit in a rapidly revolving shutter made it visible\r\nfor a very small fraction of a second. Holes punched at regular\r\nintervals along each side of the film engaged with studs on a wheel,\r\nand insured a regular motion of the pictures. This principle of a\r\nperforated film has been used by nearly all subsequent manufacturers\r\nof animatographs.\r\n\r\nTo secure forty-six negatives per second Edison invented a special\r\nexposure device. Each negative would have but one-forty-sixth of a\r\nsecond to itself, and that must include the time during which the\r\nfresh surface of film was being brought into position before the lens.\r\nHe therefore introduced an intermittent gearing, which jerked the\r\nfilm forwards forty-six times per second, but allowed it to remain\r\nstationary for nine-tenths of the period allotted to each picture.\r\nDuring the time of movement the lens was covered by the shutter. This\r\nprinciple of exposure has also been largely adopted by other\r\ninventors. By its means weak negatives are avoided, while pictures\r\nprojected on to a screen gain greatly in brilliancy and steadiness.\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of a long flexible film-band having been shown by\r\nEdison, he was not long without imitators. Phantoscopes, Bioscopes,\r\nPhotoscopes, and many other instruments followed in quick succession.\r\nIn 1895 Messrs. Lumière scored a great success with their\r\nCinematograph, which they exhibited at Marseilles and Paris; throwing\r\nthe living picture as we now know it on to a screen for a large\r\ncompany to see. This camera-lantern opens the era of commercial\r\nanimated-photography. The number of patents taken out since 1895 in\r\nconnection with living-picture machines is sufficient proof that\r\ninventors have either found in this particular branch of photography a\r\npeculiar fascination, or have anticipated from it a substantial\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nA company known as the Mutoscope and Biograph Company has been formed\r\nfor the sole object of working the manufacture and exhibition of the\r\nliving picture on a great commercial scale. The present company is\r\nAmerican, but there are subsidiary allied companies in many parts of\r\nthe world, including the British Isles, France, Italy, Belgium,\r\nGermany, Austria, India, Australia, South Africa. The part that the\r\ncompany has played in the development of animated photography will be\r\neasily understood from the short account that follows.\r\n\r\nThe company controls three machines, the Mutograph, or camera for\r\nmaking negatives; the Biograph, or lantern for throwing pictures on to\r\nthe screen; and the Mutoscope, a familiar apparatus in which the same\r\npictures may be seen in a different fashion on the payment of a penny.\r\n\r\nExternally the Mutograph is remarkable for its size, which makes it a\r\ngiant of its kind. The complete apparatus weighs, with its\r\naccumulators, several hundreds of pounds. It takes a very large\r\npicture, as animatograph pictures go--two by two-and-a-half inches,\r\nwhich, besides giving increased detail, require less severe\r\nmagnification than is usual with other films. The camera can make up\r\nto a hundred exposures per second, in which time _twenty-two_ feet of\r\nfilm will have passed before the lens.\r\n\r\nThe film is so heavy that were it arrested bodily during each exposure\r\nand then jerked forward again, it might be injured. The mechanism of\r\nthe mutograph, driven at regular speed, by an electric motor, has been\r\nso arranged as to halt only that part of the film which is being\r\nexposed, the rest moving forward continuously. The exposed portion,\r\ntogether with the next surface, which has accumulated in a loop\r\nbehind it, is dragged on by two rollers that are in contact with the\r\nfilm during part only of their revolutions. Thus the jerky motion is\r\nconfined to but a few inches of the film, and even at the highest\r\nspeeds the camera is peculiarly free from vibration.\r\n\r\nAn exposed mutograph film is wound for development round a skeleton\r\nreel, three feet in diameter and seven long, which rotates in a\r\nshallow trough containing the developing solution. Development\r\ncomplete, the reel is lifted from its supports and suspended over a\r\nsuccession of other troughs for washing, fixing, and final washing.\r\nWhen dry the negative film is passed through a special printing frame\r\nin contact with another film, which receives the positive image for\r\nthe biograph. The difficulty of handling such films will be\r\nappreciated to a certain extent even by those whose experience is\r\nconfined to the snaky behaviour of a short Kodak reel during\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Mutoscope Company’s organisation is as perfect as its machinery.\r\nIt has representatives in all parts of the world. Wherever stirring\r\nevents are taking place, whether in peace or war, a mutograph operator\r\nwill soon be on the spot with his heavy apparatus to secure pictures\r\nfor world-wide exhibition. It need hardly be said that great\r\nobstacles, human and physical, have often to be overcome before a film\r\ncan be exposed; and considerable personal danger encountered. We read\r\nthat an operator, despatched to Cuba during the Spanish-American War\r\nwas left three days and nights without food or water to guard his\r\nprecious instruments, the party that had landed him having suddenly\r\nput to sea on sighting a Spanish cruiser. Another is reported to have\r\nhad a narrow escape from being captured at sea by the Spaniards after\r\na hot chase. It is also on record that a mutograph set up in Atlantic\r\nCity to take a procession of fire-engines was charged and shattered by\r\none of the engines; that the operators were flung into the crowd: and\r\nthat nevertheless the box containing the exposed films was uninjured,\r\nand on development yielded a very sensational series of pictures\r\nlasting to the moment of collision.\r\n\r\nThe Mutoscope Company owns several thousand series of views, none\r\nprobably more valuable than those of his Holiness the Pope, who\r\ngraciously gave Mr. W. K. Dickson five special sittings, during which\r\nno less than 17,000 negatives were made, each one of great interest to\r\nmillions of people throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe company spares neither time nor money in its endeavour to supply\r\nthe public with what will prove acceptable. A year’s output runs into\r\na couple of hundred miles of film. As much as 700 feet is sometimes\r\nexpended on a single series, which may be worth anything up to £1000.\r\n\r\nThe energy displayed by the operators is often marvellous. To take\r\ninstances. The Derby of 1898 was run at 3.20 P.M. At ten o’clock the\r\nrace was run again by Biograph on the great sheet at the Palace\r\nTheatre. On the home-coming of Lord Kitchener from the Soudan\r\nCampaign, a series of photographs was taken at Dover in the afternoon\r\nand exhibited the same evening! Or again, to consider a wider sphere\r\nof action, the Jubilee Procession of 1897 was watched in New York ten\r\ndays after the event; two days later in Chicago; and in three more the\r\nfilms were attracting large audiences in San Francisco, 5000 miles\r\nfrom the actual scene of the procession!\r\n\r\nOne may easily weary of a series of single views passed slowly through\r\na magic-lantern at a lecture or entertainment. But when the Biograph\r\nis flashing its records at lightning speed there is no cause for\r\ndullness. It is impossible to escape from the fascination of\r\n_movement_. A single photograph gives the impression of mere\r\nresemblance to the original; but a series, each reinforcing the\r\nsignification of the last, breathes life into the dead image, and\r\ndeludes us into the belief that we see, not the representation of a\r\nthing, but the thing itself. The bill of fare provided by the Biograph\r\nCompany is varied enough to suit the most fastidious taste. Now it is\r\nthe great Naval Review off Spithead, or President Faure shooting\r\npheasants on his preserves near Paris. A moment’s pause and then the\r\nmagnificent Falls of Niagara foam across the sheet; Maxim guns fire\r\nharmlessly; panoramic scenes taken from locomotives running at high\r\nvelocity unfold themselves to the delighted spectators, who feel as if\r\nthey really were speeding over open country, among towering rocks, or\r\nplunging into the darkness of a tunnel. Here is an express approaching\r\nwith all the quiver and fuss of real motion, so faithfully rendered\r\nthat it seems as if a catastrophe were imminent; when, snap! we are\r\ntransported a hundred miles to watch it glide into a station. The\r\ndoors open, passengers step out and shake hands with friends, porters\r\nbustle about after luggage, doors are slammed again, the guard waves\r\nhis flag, and the carriages move slowly out of the picture. Then our\r\nattention is switched away to the 10-inch disappearing gun, landing\r\nand firing at Sandy Hook. And next, as though to show that nothing is\r\nbeneath the notice of the biograph, we are perhaps introduced to a\r\nfamily of small pigs feeding from a trough with porcine earnestness\r\nand want of manners.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that the Living Picture caters for mere\r\nentertainment only. It serves some very practical and useful ends. By\r\nits aid the movements of machinery and the human muscles may be\r\nstudied in detail, to aid a mechanical or medical education. It\r\nfurnishes art schools with all the poses of a living model. Less\r\nserious pursuits, such as dancing, boxing, wrestling and all athletic\r\nsports and exercise, will find a use for it. As an advertising medium\r\nit stands unrivalled, and we shall owe it a deep debt of gratitude if\r\nit ultimately supplants the flaring posters that disfigure our towns\r\nand desecrate our landscapes. Not so long since, the directors of the\r\nNorddeutscher-Lloyd Steamship Company hired the biograph at the\r\nPalace Theatre, London, to demonstrate to anybody who cared to witness\r\na very interesting exhibition that their line of vessels should always\r\nbe used for a journey between England and America.\r\n\r\nThe Living Picture has even been impressed into the service of the\r\nBritish Empire to promote emigration to the Colonies. Three years ago\r\nMr. Freer exhibited at the Imperial Institute and in other places in\r\nEngland a series of films representing the 1897 harvest in Manitoba.\r\nWould-be emigrants were able to satisfy themselves that the great\r\nCanadian plains were fruitful not only on paper. For could they not\r\nsee with their own eyes the stately procession of automatic “binders”\r\nreaping, binding, and delivering sheaves of wheat, and puffing engines\r\nthreshing out the grain ready for market? A far preferable method this\r\nto the bogus descriptions of land companies such as lured poor\r\nChuzzlewit and Mark Tapley into the deadly swamps of “Eden.”\r\n\r\nAgain, what more calculated to recruit boys for our warships than the\r\nfine Polytechnic exhibition known as “Our Navy”? What words, spoken or\r\nprinted, could have the effect of a series of vivid scenes truthfully\r\nrendered, of drills on board ship, the manning and firing of big guns,\r\nthe limbering-up of smaller guns, the discharge of torpedoes, the\r\nheadlong rush of the “destroyers”?\r\n\r\nThe Mutoscope, to which reference has been made above, may be found in\r\nmost places of public entertainment, in refreshment bars, on piers,\r\nin exhibitions, on promenades. A penny dropped into a slot releases a\r\nhandle, the turning of which brings a series of pictures under\r\ninspection. The pictures, enlarged from mutograph films, are mounted\r\nin consecutive order round a cylinder, standing out like the leaves of\r\na book. When the cylinder is revolved by means of the handle the\r\npicture cards are snapped past the eye, giving an effect similar to\r\nthe lifelike projections on a biograph screen. From 900 to 1000\r\npictures are mounted on a cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the mutoscope--its convenient size, its simplicity,\r\nand the ease with which its contents may be changed to illustrate the\r\ntopics and events of the day--have made the animated photograph\r\nextremely popular. It does for vision what the phonograph does for\r\nsound. In a short time we shall doubtless be provided with handy\r\nmachines combining the two functions and giving us double value for\r\nour penny.\r\n\r\nThe real importance and value of animated photography will be more\r\neasily estimated a few years hence than to-day, when it is still more\r\nor less of a novelty. The multiplication of illustrated newspapers and\r\nmagazines points to a general desire for pictorial matter to help down\r\nthe daily, weekly, or monthly budget of news, even if the\r\nillustrations be imaginative products of Fleet Street rather than\r\nfaithful to fact. The reliable living picture (we expect the\r\n“set-scene”) which “holds up a mirror to nature,” will be a companion\r\nrather than a rival of journalism, following hard on the description\r\nin print of an event that has taken place under the eye of the\r\nrecording camera. The zest with which we have watched during the last\r\ntwo years biographic views of the embarkation and disembarkation of\r\ntroops, of the transport of big guns through drifts and difficult\r\ncountry, and of the other circumstances of war, is largely due to the\r\ndescriptions we have already read of the things that we see on the\r\nscreen. And, on the other hand, the impression left by a series of\r\nanimated views will dwell in our memories long after the contents of\r\nthe newspaper columns have become confused and jumbled. It is\r\ntherefore especially to be hoped that photographic records will be\r\nkept of historic events, such as the Jubilee, the Queen’s Funeral,\r\nKing Edward’s Coronation, so that future generations may, by the\r\nturning of a handle, be brought face to face with the great doings of\r\na bygone age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PARIS TELESCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nA telescope so powerful that it brings the moon apparently to within\r\nthirty-five miles of the earth; so long that many a cricketer could\r\nnot throw a ball from one end of it to the other; so heavy that it\r\nwould by itself make a respectable load for a goods train; so\r\nexpensive that astronomically-inclined millionaires might well\r\nhesitate to order a similar one for their private use.\r\n\r\nSuch is the huge Paris telescope that in 1900 delighted thousands of\r\nvisitors in the French Exposition, where, among the many wonderful\r\nsights to be seen on all sides, it probably attracted more notice than\r\nany other exhibit. This triumph of scientific engineering and dogged\r\nperseverance in the face of great difficulties owes its being to a\r\nsuggestion made in 1894 to a group of French astronomers by M.\r\nDeloncle. He proposed to bring astronomy to the front at the coming\r\nExposition, and to effect this by building a refracting telescope that\r\nin size and power should completely eclipse all existing instruments\r\nand add a new chapter to the “story of the heavens.”\r\n\r\nTo the mind unversed in astronomy the telescope appeals by the\r\nmagnitude of its dimensions, in the same way as do the Forth Bridge,\r\nthe Eiffel Tower, the Big Wheel, the statue of Liberty near New York\r\nharbour, the Pyramids, and most human-made “biggest on records.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of M. Deloncle’s proposal the largest refracting telescope\r\nwas the Yerkes’ at William’s Bay, Wisconsin, with an object-glass\r\nforty inches in diameter; and next to it the 36-inch Lick instrument\r\non Mount Hamilton, California, built by Messrs. Alvan Clark of\r\nCambridgeport, Massachusetts. Among reflecting telescopes the prior\r\nplace is still held by Lord Rosse’s, set up on the lawn of Birr Castle\r\nhalf a century ago. Its speculum, or mirror, weighing three tons, lies\r\nat the lower end of a tube six feet across and sixty feet long. This\r\nhuge reflector, being mounted in meridian, moves only in a vertical\r\ndirection. A refracting telescope is one of the ordinary pocket type,\r\nhaving an object-lens at one end and an eyepiece at the other. A\r\nreflector, on the other hand, has no object-lens, its place being\r\ntaken by a mirror that gathers the rays entering the tube and reflects\r\nthem back into the eyepiece, which is situated nearer the mouth end of\r\nthe tube than the mirror itself.\r\n\r\nEach system has its peculiar disadvantages. In reflectors the image is\r\nmore or less distorted by “spherical aberration.” In refractors the\r\nimage is approximately perfect in shape, but liable to “chromatic\r\naberration,” a phenomenon especially noticeable in cheap telescopes\r\nand field-glasses, which often show objects fringed with some of the\r\ncolours of the spectrum. This defect arises from the different\r\nrefrangibility of different light rays. Thus, violet rays come to a\r\nfocus at a shorter distance from the lens than red rays, and when one\r\nset is in focus to the eye the other must be out of focus. In\r\ncarefully-made and expensive instruments compound lenses are used,\r\nwhich by the employment of different kinds of glass bring all the\r\ncolours to practically the same focus, and so do away with chromatic\r\naberration.\r\n\r\nTo reduce colour troubles to a _minimum_ M. Deloncle proposed that the\r\nobject-lens should have a focal distance of about two hundred feet,\r\nsince a long focus is more easily corrected than a short one, and a\r\ndiameter of over fifty-nine inches. The need for so huge a lens arises\r\nout of the optical principles of a refractor. The rays from an\r\nobject--a star, for instance--strike the object-glass at the near end,\r\nand are bent by it into a converging beam, till they all meet at the\r\nfocus. Behind the focus they again separate, and are caught by the\r\neyepiece, which reduces them to a parallel beam small enough to enter\r\nthe pupil. We thus see that though the unaided eye gathers only the\r\nfew rays that fall directly from the object on to the pupil, when\r\nhelped by the telescope it receives the concentrated rays falling on\r\nthe whole area of the object-glass; and it would be sensible of a\r\ngreatly increased brightness had not this light to be redistributed\r\nover the image, which is the object magnified by the eyepiece.\r\nAssuming the aperture of the pupil to be one-tenth of an inch, and\r\nthe object to be magnified a hundred times, the object-lens should\r\nhave a hundred times the diameter of the pupil to render the image as\r\nbright as the object itself. If the lens be five instead of ten inches\r\nacross, a great loss of light results, as in the high powers of a\r\nmicroscope, and the image loses in distinctness what it gains in size.\r\n\r\nAs M. Deloncle meant his telescope to beat all records in respect of\r\nmagnification, he had no choice but to make a lens that should give\r\nproportionate illumination, and itself be of unprecedented size.\r\n\r\nAt first M. Deloncle met with considerable opposition and ridicule.\r\nSuch a scheme as his was declared to be beyond accomplishment. But in\r\nspite of many prophecies of ultimate failure he set to work,\r\nentrusting the construction of the various portions of his colossal\r\ntelescope to well-tried experts. To M. Gautier was given the task of\r\nmaking all the mechanical parts of the apparatus; to M. Mantois the\r\ncasting of the giant lenses; to M. Despret the casting of the huge\r\nmirror, to which reference will be made immediately.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty to be encountered arose from the sheer size of\r\nthe instrument. It was evidently impossible to mount such a leviathan\r\nin the ordinary way. A tube, 180 feet long, could not be made rigid\r\nenough to move about and yet permit careful observation of the stars.\r\nEven supposing that it were satisfactorily mounted on an “equatorial\r\nfoot” like smaller glasses, how could it be protected from wind and\r\nweather? To cover it, a mighty dome, two hundred feet or more in\r\ndiameter, would be required; a dome exceeding by over seventy feet the\r\ncupola of St. Peter’s, Rome; and this dome must revolve easily on its\r\nbase at a pace of about fifty feet an hour, so that the telescope\r\nmight follow the motion of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nThe constructors therefore decided to abandon any idea of making a\r\ntelescope that could be moved about and pointed in any desired\r\ndirection. The alternative course open to them was to fix the\r\ntelescope itself rigidly in position, and to bring the stars within\r\nits field by means of a mirror mounted on a massive iron frame--the\r\ntwo together technically called a siderostat. The mirror and its\r\nsupport would be driven by clockwork at the proper sidereal rate. The\r\nsiderostat principle had been employed as early as the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and perfected in recent years by Léon Foucault, so that in\r\nhaving recourse to it the builders of the telescope were not\r\ncommitting themselves to any untried device.\r\n\r\nIn days when the handling of masses of iron, and the erection of huge\r\nmetal constructions have become matters of everyday engineering life,\r\nno peculiar difficulty presented itself in connection with the\r\nmetal-work of the telescope. The greatest possible care was of course\r\nobserved in every particular. All joints and bearings were adjusted\r\nwith an extraordinary accuracy; and all the cylindrical moving parts\r\nof the siderostat verified till they did not vary from perfect\r\ncylindricity by so much as one twenty-five-thousandth of an inch!\r\n\r\nThe tube of the telescope, 180 feet long, consisted of twenty-four\r\nsections, fifty-nine inches in diameter, bolted together and supported\r\non seven massive iron pillars. It weighed twenty-one tons. The\r\nsiderostat, twenty-seven feet high, and as many in length, weighed\r\nforty-five tons. The lower portion, which was fixed firmly on a bed of\r\nconcrete, had on the top a tank filled with quicksilver, in which the\r\nmirror and its frame floated. The quicksilver supported nine-tenths of\r\nthe weight, the rest being taken by the levers used to move the\r\nmirror. Though the total weight of the mirror and frame was thirteen\r\ntons, the quicksilver offered so little resistance that a pull of a\r\nfew pounds sufficed to rotate the entire mass.\r\n\r\nThe real romance of the construction of this huge telescope centres on\r\nthe making of the lenses and mirror. First-class lenses for all\r\nphotographic and optical purposes command a very high price on account\r\nof the care and labour that has to be expended on their production;\r\nthe value of the glass being trifling by comparison. Few, if any,\r\ntrades require greater mechanical skill than that of lensmaking; the\r\nlarger the lens the greater the difficulties it presents, first in the\r\ncasting, then in the grinding, last of all in the polishing. The\r\npresence of a single air-bubble in the molten glass, the slightest\r\nirregularity of surface in the polishing may utterly destroy the\r\nvalue of a lens otherwise worth several thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced by the permission of Proprietors of\r\n“Knowledge.”_\r\n\r\n_General view, of the Great Paris Telescope, showing the eye-end. The\r\ntube is 180 feet long, and 59 inches in diameter. It weighs 21 tons._]\r\n\r\nThe object-glass of the great telescope was cast by M. Mantois, famous\r\nas the manufacturer of large lenses. The glass used was boiled and\r\nreboiled many times to get rid of all bubbles. Then it was run into a\r\nmould and allowed to cool very gradually. A whole month elapsed before\r\nthe breaking of a mould, when the lens often proved to be cracked on\r\nthe surface, owing to the exterior having cooled faster than the\r\ninterior and parted company with it. At last, however, a perfect cast\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nM. Despret undertook the even more formidable task of casting the\r\nmirror at his works at Jeumont, North France. A special furnace and\r\noven, capable of containing over fifteen tons of molten glass, had to\r\nbe constructed. The mirror, 6-1/2 feet in diameter and eleven inches\r\nthick, absorbed 3-3/4 tons of liquid glass; and so great was the\r\ndifficulty of cooling it gradually, that out of the twenty casts\r\neighteen were failures.\r\n\r\nThe rough lenses and mirror having been ground to approximate\r\ncorrectness in the ordinary way, there arose the question of\r\npolishing, which is generally done by one of the most sensitive and\r\nperfect instruments existing-the human hand. In this case, owing to\r\nthe enormous size of the objects to be treated, hand work would not\r\ndo. The mere hot touch of a workman would raise on the glass a tiny\r\nprotuberance, which would be worn level with the rest of the surface\r\nby the polisher, and on the cooling of the part would leave a\r\ndepression, only 1-75,000 of an inch deep, perhaps, but sufficient to\r\nproduce distortion, and require that the lens should be ground down\r\nagain, and the whole surface polished afresh.\r\n\r\nM. Gautier therefore polished by machinery. It proved a very difficult\r\nprocess altogether, on account of frictional heating, the rise of\r\ntemperature in the polishing room, and the presence of dust. To insure\r\nsuccess it was found necessary to warm all the polishing machinery,\r\nand to keep it at a fixed temperature.\r\n\r\nAt the end of almost a year the polishing was finished, after the\r\nlenses and mirror had been subjected to the most searching tests, able\r\nto detect irregularities not exceeding 1-250,000 of an inch. M.\r\nGautier applied to the mirror M. Foucault’s test, which is worth\r\nmentioning. A point of light thrown by the mirror is focused through a\r\ntelescope. The eyepiece is then moved inwards and outwards so as to\r\nthrow the point out of focus. If the point becomes a luminous circle\r\nsurrounded by concentric rings, the surface throwing the light point\r\nis perfectly plane or smooth. If, however, a pushing-in shows a\r\nvertical flattening of the point, and a pulling-out a horizontal\r\nflattening, that part is concave; if the reverse happens, convexity is\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nFor the removal of the mirror from Jeumont to Paris a special train\r\nwas engaged, and precautions were taken rivalling those by which\r\ntravelling Royalty is guarded. The train ran at night without\r\nstopping, and at a constant pace, so that the vibration of the glass\r\natoms might not vary. On arriving at Paris, the mirror was transferred\r\nto a ponderous waggon, and escorted by a body of men to the Exposition\r\nbuildings. The huge object-lens received equally careful treatment.\r\n\r\nThe telescope was housed at the Exhibition in a long gallery pointing\r\ndue north and south, the siderostat at the north end. At the other,\r\nthe eyepiece, end, a large amphitheatre accommodated the public\r\nassembled to watch the projection of stellar or lunar images on to a\r\nscreen thirty feet high, while a lecturer explained what was visible\r\nfrom time to time. The images of the sun and moon as they appeared at\r\nthe primary focus in the eyepiece measured from twenty-one to\r\ntwenty-two inches in diameter, and the screen projections were\r\nmagnified from these about thirty times superficially.\r\n\r\nThe eyepiece section consisted of a short tube, of the same breadth as\r\nthe main tube, resting on four wheels that travelled along rails.\r\nSpecial gearing moved this truck-like construction backwards and\r\nforwards to bring a sharp focus into the eyepiece or on to a\r\nphotographic plate. Focusing was thus easy enough when once the\r\ndesired object came in view; but the observer being unable to control\r\nthe siderostat, 250 feet distant, had to telephone directions to an\r\nassistant stationed near the mirror whenever he wished to examine an\r\nobject not in the field of vision.\r\n\r\nBy the courtesy of the proprietors of the _Strand_ _Magazine_ we are\r\nallowed to quote M. Deloncle’s own words describing his emotions on\r\nhis first view through the giant telescope:--\r\n\r\n“As is invariably the case, whenever an innovation that sets at nought\r\nold-established theories is brought forward, the prophecies of failure\r\nwere many and loud, and I had more than a suspicion that my success\r\nwould cause less satisfaction to others than to myself. Better than\r\nany one else I myself was cognisant of the unpropitious conditions in\r\nwhich my instrument had to work. The proximity of the river, the dust\r\nraised by hundreds of thousands of trampling feet, the trepidation of\r\nthe soil, the working of the machinery, the changes of temperature,\r\nthe glare from the thousands of electric lamps in close\r\nproximity--each of these circumstances, and many others of a more\r\ntechnical nature, which it would be tedious to enumerate, but which\r\nwere no less important, would have been more than sufficient to make\r\nany astronomer despair of success even in observatories where all the\r\nsurroundings are chosen with the utmost care.\r\n\r\n“In regions pure of calm and serene air large new instruments take\r\nmonths, more often years, to regulate properly.\r\n\r\n“In spite of everything, however, I still felt confident. Our\r\ncalculations had been gone over again and again, and I could see\r\nnothing that in my opinion warranted the worst apprehensions of my\r\nkind critics.\r\n\r\n“It was with ill-restrained impatience that I waited for the first\r\nnight when the moon should show herself in a suitable position for\r\nbeing observed; but the night arrived in due course.\r\n\r\n“Everything was in readiness. The movable portion of the roof of the\r\nbuilding had been slid back, and the mirror of the siderostat stood\r\nbared to the sky.\r\n\r\n“In the dark, square chamber at the other end of the instrument, 200\r\nfeet away, into which the eyepiece of the instrument opened, I had\r\ntaken my station with two or three friends. An attendant at the\r\ntelephone stood waiting at my elbow to transmit my orders to his\r\ncolleague in charge of the levers that regulated the siderostat and\r\nits mirror.\r\n\r\n“The moon had risen now, and her silvery glory shone and sparkled in\r\nthe mirror.\r\n\r\n“‘A right declension,’ I ordered.\r\n\r\n“The telephone bell rang in reply. ‘Slowly, still slower; now to the\r\nleft--enough; again a right declension--slower; stop now--very, very\r\nslowly.’\r\n\r\n“On the ground-glass before our eyes the moon’s image crept up from\r\none corner until it had overspread the glass completely. And there we\r\nstood in the centre of Paris, examining the surface of our satellite\r\nwith all its craters and valleys and bleak desolation.\r\n\r\n“I had won the day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHING THE INVISIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us are able to recognise when we see them shadowgraphs taken\r\nby the aid of the now famous X-rays. They generally represent some\r\npart of the structure of men, beasts, birds, or fishes. Very dark\r\npatches show the position of the bones, large and small; lighter\r\npatches the more solid muscles clinging to the bony framework; and\r\noutside these again are shadowy tracts corresponding to the thinnest\r\nand most transparent portions of the fleshy envelope.\r\n\r\nIn an age fruitful as this in scientific marvels, it often takes some\r\nconsiderable time for the public to grasp the full importance of a\r\nfresh discovery. But when, in 1896, it was announced that Professor\r\nRöntgen of Würzburg had actually taken photographs of the internal\r\norgans of still living creatures, and penetrated metal and other\r\nopaque substances with a new kind of ray, great interest was\r\nmanifested throughout the civilised world. On the one hand the “new\r\nphotography” seemed to upset popular ideas of opacity; on the other it\r\nsavoured strongly of the black art, and, by its easy excursions\r\nthrough the human body, seemed likely to revolutionise medical and\r\nsurgical methods. At first many strange ideas about the X-rays got\r\nafloat, attributing to them powers which would have surprised even\r\ntheir modest discoverer. It was also thought that the records were\r\nmade in a camera after the ordinary manner of photography, but as a\r\nmatter of fact Röntgen used neither lens nor camera, the operation\r\nbeing similar to that of casting a shadow on a wall by means of a\r\nlamp. In X-radiography a specially constructed electrically-lit glass\r\ntube takes the place of the lamp, and for the wall is substituted a\r\nsensitised plate. The object to be radiographed is merely inserted\r\nbetween them, its various parts offering varying resistance to the\r\nrays, so that the plate is affected unequally, and after exposure may\r\nbe developed and printed from it the usual way. Photographs obtained\r\nby using X-rays are therefore properly called shadowgraphs or\r\nskiagraphs.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that has made Professor Röntgen famous is, like many\r\ngreat discoveries, based upon the labours of other men in the same\r\nfield. Geissler, whose vacuum tubes are so well known for their\r\nstriking colour effects, had already noticed that electric discharges\r\nsent through very much rarefied air or gases produced beautiful glows.\r\nSir William Crookes, following the same line of research, and reducing\r\nwith a Sprengel air-pump the internal pressure of the tubes to\r\n1/100000 of an atmosphere, found that a luminous glow streamed from\r\nthe cathode, or negative pole, in a straight line, heating and\r\nrendering phosphorescent anything that it met. Crookes regarded the\r\nglow as composed of “radiant matter,” and explained its existence as\r\nfollows. The airy particles inside the tube, being few in number, are\r\nable to move about with far greater freedom than in the tightly packed\r\natmosphere outside the tube. A particle, on reaching the cathode, is\r\nrepelled violently by it in a straight line, to “bombard” another\r\nparticle, the walls of the tube, or any object set up in its path, the\r\nsudden arrest of motion being converted into light and heat.\r\n\r\nBy means of special tubes he proved that the “radiant matter” could\r\nturn little vanes, and that the flow continued even when the terminals\r\nof the shocking-coil were _outside_ the glass, thus meeting the\r\ncontention of Puluj that the radiant matter was nothing more than\r\nsmall particles of platinum torn from the terminals. He also showed\r\nthat, when intercepted, radiant matter cast a shadow, the intercepting\r\nobject receiving the energy of the bombardment; but that when the\r\nobstruction was removed the hitherto sheltered part of the glass wall\r\nof the tube glowed with a brighter phosphorescence than the part which\r\nhad become “tired” by prolonged bombardment. Experiments further\r\nrevealed the fact that the shaft of “Cathode rays” could be deflected\r\nby a magnet from their course, and that they affected an ordinary\r\nphotographic plate exposed to them.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Lenard, a Hungarian, and pupil of the famous Hertz, fitted a\r\nCrookes’ tube with a “window” of aluminium in its side replacing a\r\npart of the glass, and saw that the course of the rays could be\r\ntraced through the outside air. From this it was evident that\r\nsomething else than matter must be present in the shaft of energy sent\r\nfrom the negative terminal of the tube, as there was no direct\r\ncommunication between the interior and the exterior of the tube to\r\naccount for the external phosphorescence. Whatever was the nature of\r\nthe rays he succeeded in making them penetrate and impress themselves\r\non a sensitised plate enclosed in a metal box.\r\n\r\nThen in 1896 came Röntgen’s great discovery that the rays from a\r\nCrookes’ tube, after traversing the _glass_, could pierce opaque\r\nmatter. He covered the tube with thick cardboard, but found that it\r\nwould still cast the shadows of books, cards, wood, metals, the human\r\nhand, &c., on to a photographic plate even at the distance of some\r\nfeet. The rays would also pass through the wood, metal, or bones in\r\ncourse of time; but certain bodies, notably metals, offered a much\r\ngreater resistance than others, such as wood, leather, and paper.\r\nProfessor Röntgen crowned his efforts by showing that a skeleton could\r\nbe “shadow-graphed” while its owner was still alive.\r\n\r\nNaturally everybody wished to know not only what the rays could do,\r\nbut what they were. Röntgen, not being able to identify them with any\r\nknown rays, took refuge in the algebraical symbol of the unknown\r\nquantity and dubbed them X-rays. He discovered this much, however,\r\nthat they were invisible to the eye under ordinary conditions; that\r\nthey travelled in straight lines only, passing through a prism, water,\r\nor other refracting bodies without turning aside from their path; and\r\nthat a magnet exerted no power over them. This last fact was\r\nsufficient of itself to prevent their confusion with the radiant\r\nmatter “cathode rays” of the tube. Röntgen thought, nevertheless, that\r\nthey might be the cathode rays transmuted in some manner by their\r\npassage through the glass, so as to resemble in their motion\r\nsound-waves, _i.e._ moving straight forward and not swaying from side\r\nto side in a series of zig-zags. The existence of such ether waves had\r\nfor some time before been suspected by Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\nOther authorities have other theories. We may mention the view that X\r\nrepresents the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, caused by vibrations\r\nof such extreme rapidity as to be imperceptible to the human eye, just\r\nas sounds of extremely high pitch are inaudible to the ear. This\r\ntheory is to a certain extent upheld by the behaviour of the\r\nphotographic plate, which is least affected by the colours of the\r\nspectrum at the red end and most by those at the violet end. A\r\nphotographer is able to use red or orange light in his dark room\r\nbecause his plates cannot “see” them, though he can; whereas the\r\nreverse would be the case with X-rays. This ultra-violet theory claims\r\nfor X-rays a rate of ether vibration of trillions of waves per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nAn alternative theory is to relegate the rays to the gap in the scale\r\nof ether-waves between heatwaves and light-waves. But this does not\r\nexplain any more satisfactorily than the other the peculiar phenomenon\r\nof non-refraction.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed in X-photography consists of a Crookes’ tube of\r\na special type, a powerful shocking or induction coil, a fluorescent\r\nscreen and photographic plates and appliances for developing, &c.,\r\nbesides a supply of high-pressure electricity derived from the main, a\r\nsmall dynamo or batteries.\r\n\r\nA Crookes’ tube is four to five inches in diameter, globular in its\r\nmiddle portion, but tapering away towards each end. Through one\r\nextremity is led a platinum wire, terminating in a saucer-shaped\r\nplatinum plate an inch or so across. At the focus of this, the\r\nnegative terminal, is fixed a platinum plate at an angle to the path\r\nof the rays so as to deflect them through the side of the tube. The\r\npositive terminal penetrates the glass at one side. The tube contains,\r\nas we have seen, a very tiny residue of air. If this were entirely\r\nexhausted the action of the tube would cease; so that some tubes are\r\nso arranged that when rarefaction becomes too high the passage of an\r\nelectrical current through small bars of chemicals, whose ends project\r\nthrough the sides of the tube, liberates gas from the bars in\r\nsufficient quantity to render the tube active again.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ruhmkorff induction coil is joined to the electric circuit a\r\nseries of violent discharges of great rapidity occur between the tube\r\nterminals, resembling in their power the discharge of a Leyden jar,\r\nthough for want of a dense atmosphere the brilliant spark has been\r\nreplaced by a glow and brush-light in the tube. The coil is of large\r\ndimensions, capable of passing a spark across an air-gap of ten to\r\ntwelve inches. It will perhaps increase the reader’s respect for\r\nX-rays to learn that a coil of proper size contains upwards of\r\nthirteen miles of wire; though indeed this quantity is nothing in\r\ncomparison with the 150 miles wound on the huge inductorium formerly\r\nexhibited at the London Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nIf we were invited to an X-ray demonstration we should find the\r\noperator and his apparatus in a darkened room. He turns on the current\r\nand the darkness is broken by a velvety glow surrounding the negative\r\nterminal, which gradually extends until the whole tube becomes clothed\r\nin a green phosphorescence. A sharply-defined line athwart the tube\r\nseparates the shadowed part behind the receiving plate at the negative\r\nfocus--now intensely hot--from that on which the reflected rays fall\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nOne of us is now invited to extend a hand close to the tube. The\r\noperator then holds on the near side of the hand his fluorescent\r\nscreen, which is nothing more than a framework supporting a paper\r\nsmeared on one side with platino-cyanide of barium, a chemical that,\r\nin common with several others, was discovered by Salvioni of Perugia\r\nto be sensitive to the rays and able to make them visible to the human\r\neye. The value of the screen to the X-radiographer is that of the\r\nground-glass plate to the ordinary photographer, as it allows him to\r\nsee exactly what things are before the sensitised plate is brought\r\ninto position, and in fact largely obviates the necessity for making a\r\npermanent record.\r\n\r\nThe screen shows clearly and in full detail all the bones of the\r\nhand--so clearly that one is almost irresistibly drawn to peep behind\r\nto see if a real hand is there. One of us now extends an arm and the\r\nscreen shows us the _ulna_ and the _radius_ working round each other,\r\nnow both visible, now one obscuring the other. On presenting the body\r\nto the course of the rays a remarkable shadow is cast on to the\r\nscreen. The spinal column and the ribs; the action of the heart and\r\nlungs are seen quite distinctly. A deep breath causes the movement of\r\na dark mass--the liver. There is no privacy in presence of the rays.\r\nThe enlarged heart, the diseased lung, the ulcerated liver betrays\r\nitself at once. In a second of time the phosphorescent screen reveals\r\nwhat might baulk medical examination for months.\r\n\r\nIf a photographic slide containing a dry-plate be substituted for the\r\nfocusing-screen, the rays soon penetrate any covering in which the\r\nplate may be wrapped to protect it from ordinary light rays. The\r\nprocess of taking a shadowgraph may therefore be conducted in broad\r\ndaylight, which is under certain conditions a great advantage, though\r\nthe sensitiveness of plates exposed to Röntgen rays entails special\r\ncare being taken of them when they are not in use. In the early days\r\nof X-radiography an exposure of some minutes was necessary to secure a\r\nnegative, but now, thanks to the improvements in the tubes, a few\r\nseconds is often sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the X-rays is a great discovery, because it has done\r\nmuch to promote the noblest possible cause, the alleviation of human\r\nsuffering. Not everybody will appreciate a more rapid mode of\r\ntelegraphy, or a new method of spinning yarn, but the dullest\r\nintellect will give due credit to a scientific process that helps to\r\nsave life and limb. Who among us is not liable to break an arm or leg,\r\nor suffer from internal injuries invisible to the eye? Who among us\r\ntherefore should not be thankful on reflecting that, in event of such\r\na mishap, the X-rays will be at hand to show just what the trouble is,\r\nhow to deal with it, and how far the healing advances day by day? The\r\nX-ray apparatus is now as necessary for the proper equipment of a\r\nhospital as a camera for that of a photographic studio.\r\n\r\nIt is especially welcome in the hospitals which accompany an army into\r\nthe field. Since May 1896 many a wounded soldier has had reason to\r\nbless the patient work that led to the discovery at Würzburg. The\r\nGreek war, the war in Cuba, the Tirah campaign, the Egyptian campaign,\r\nand the war in South Africa, have given a quick succession of fine\r\nopportunities for putting the new photography to the test. There is\r\nnow small excuse for the useless and agonising probings that once\r\nadded to the dangers and horrors of the military hospital. Even if the\r\nX-ray equipment, by reason of its weight, cannot conveniently be kept\r\nat the front of a rapidly moving army, it can be set up in the\r\n“advanced” or “base” hospitals, whither the wounded are sent after a\r\nfirst rough dressing of their injuries. The medical staff there\r\nsubject their patients to the searching rays, are able to record the\r\nexact position of a bullet or shell-fragment, and the damage it has\r\ndone; and by promptly removing the intruder to greatly lessen its\r\npower to harm.\r\n\r\nThe Röntgen ray has added to the surgeon’s armoury a powerful weapon.\r\nIts possibilities are not yet fully known, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat it marks a new epoch in surgical work. And for this reason\r\nProfessor Röntgen deserves to rank with Harvey, the discoverer of the\r\nblood’s circulation; with Jenner, the father of vaccination; and with\r\nSir James Young Simpson, the first doctor to use chloroform as an\r\nanæsthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY IN THE DARK.\r\n\r\nStrange as it seems to take photographs with invisible rays, it is\r\nstill stranger to be able to affect sensitised plates without\r\napparently the presence of any kind of rays.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. J. Russell, Vice-President of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, has discovered that many substances have the power of\r\nimpressing their outlines automatically on a sensitive film, if the\r\nsubstance be placed in a dark cupboard in contact with, or very close\r\nto a dry-plate.\r\n\r\nAfter some hours, or it may be days, development of the plate will\r\nreveal a distinct impression of the body in question. Dr. Russell\r\nexperimented with wood, metal, leaves, drawings, printed matter, lace.\r\nZinc proved to be an unusually active agent. A plate of the metal,\r\nhighly polished and then ruled with patterns, had at the end of a few\r\ndays imparted a record of every scratch and mark to the plate. And not\r\nonly will zinc impress itself, but it affects substances which are not\r\nthemselves active, throwing shadowgraphs on to the plate. This was\r\ndemonstrated with samples of lace, laid between a plate and a small\r\nsheet of bright zinc; also with a skeleton leaf. It is curious that\r\nwhile the interposition of thin films of celluloid, gutta-percha,\r\nvegetable parchment, and gold-beater’s skin--all inactive--between the\r\nzinc and the plate has no obstructive effect, a plate of thin glass\r\ncounteracts the action of the zinc. Besides zinc, nickel, aluminium,\r\npewter, lead, and tin among the metals influence a sensitised plate.\r\nAnother totally different substance, printer’s ink, has a similar\r\npower; or at least some printer’s ink, for Professor Russell found\r\nthat different samples varied greatly in their effects. What is\r\nespecially curious, the printed matter on _both sides_ of a piece of\r\nnewspaper appeared on the plate, and that the effect proceeded from\r\nthe ink and not from any rays passing from beyond it is proved by the\r\nfact that the type came out _dark_ in the development, whereas if it\r\nhad been a case of shadowgraphy, the ink by intercepting rays would\r\nhave produced _white_ letters. Professor Russell has also shown that\r\nmodern writing ink is incapable of producing an impression unaided,\r\nbut that on the other hand paper written on a hundred years ago or a\r\nprinted book centuries old will, with the help of zinc, yield a\r\npicture in which even faded and uncertain characters appear quite\r\ndistinctly. This opens the way to a practical use of the discovery, in\r\nthe deciphering of old and partly obliterated manuscripts.\r\n\r\nA very interesting experiment may be made with that useful\r\npossession--a five-pound note. Place the note printed side next to the\r\nplate, and the printing appears dark; but insert the note between a\r\nzinc sheet and the plate, its back being this time towards the\r\nsensitised surface, and the printing appears _white_; and the zinc,\r\nafter contact with the printed side, will itself yield a picture of\r\nthe inscription as though it had absorbed some virtue from the note!\r\n\r\nAs explanation of this paradoxical dark photography--or whatever it\r\nis--two theories may be advanced. The one--favoured by Professor\r\nRussell--is that all “active” substances give off _vapours_ able to\r\nact on a photographic plate. In support of this may be urged the fact\r\nthat the interposition of glass prevents the making of dark pictures.\r\nBut on the other hand it must be remembered that celluloid and\r\nsheet-gelatine, also air-tight substances, are able to store up light\r\nand to give it out again. It is well known among photographers that to\r\nallow sunlight to fall on the inside of a camera is apt to have a\r\n“fogging” effect on a plate that is exposed in the camera afterwards,\r\nthough the greatest care be taken to keep all external light from the\r\nplate. But here the glass again presents a difficulty, for if this\r\nwere a case of reflected light, glass would evidently be _less_\r\nobstructive than opaque vegetable parchment or gutta-percha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLAR MOTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day George Stephenson and a friend stood watching a train drawn by\r\none of his locomotives.\r\n\r\n“What moves that train?” asked Stephenson.\r\n\r\n“The engine,” replied his friend.\r\n\r\n“And what moves the engine?”\r\n\r\n“The steam.”\r\n\r\n“And what produces the steam?”\r\n\r\n“Coal.”\r\n\r\n“And what produces coal?”\r\n\r\nThis last query nonplussed his friend, and Stephenson himself replied,\r\n“The sun.”\r\n\r\nThe “bottled sunshine” that drove the locomotive was stored up\r\nmillions of years ago in the dense forests then covering the face of\r\nthe globe. Every day vegetation was built by the sunbeams, and in the\r\ncourse of ages this growth was crushed into fossil form by the\r\npressure of high-piled rock and débris. To-day we cast “black\r\ndiamonds” into our grates and furnaces, to call out the warmth and\r\npower that is a legacy from a period long prior to the advent of\r\nfire-loving man, often forgetful of its real source.\r\n\r\nWe see the influence of the sun more directly in the motions of wind\r\nand water. Had not the sun’s action deposited snow and rain on the\r\nuplands of the world, there would be no roaring waterfall, no rushing\r\ntorrent, no smooth-flowing stream. But for the sun heating the\r\natmosphere unequally, there would not be that rushing of cool air to\r\nreplace hot which we know as wind.\r\n\r\nWe press Sol into our service when we burn fuel; our wind-mills and\r\nwater-mills make him our slave. Of late years many prophets have\r\narisen to warn us that we must not be too lavish of our coal; that the\r\ntime is not so far distant, reckoning by centuries, when the\r\ncoal-seams of the world will be worked out and leave our descendants\r\ndestitute of what plays so important a part in modern life. Now,\r\nthough waste is unpardonable, and the care for posterity praiseworthy,\r\nthere really seems to be no good reason why we should alarm ourselves\r\nabout the welfare of the people of the far future. Even if coal fails,\r\nthe winds and the rivers will be there, and the huge unharnessed\r\nenergy of the tides, and the sun himself is ready to answer appeals\r\nfor help, if rightly shaped. He does not demand the prayers of Persian\r\nfire-worshippers, but rather the scientific gathering of his good\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nPlace your hand on a roof lying square to the summer sun, and you will\r\nfind it too hot for the touch. Concentrate a beam of sunshine through\r\na small burning-glass. How fierce is the small glowing focal spot that\r\nmakes us draw our hands suddenly away! Suppose now a large glass many\r\nfeet across bending several square yards of sun rays to a point, and\r\nat that point a boiler. The boiler would develop steam, and the steam\r\nmight be led into cylinders and forced to drudge for us.\r\n\r\nDo many of us realise the enormous energy of a hot summer’s day? The\r\nheat falling in the tropics on a single square foot of the earth’s\r\nsurface has been estimated as the equivalent of one-third of a\r\nhorse-power. The force of Niagara itself would on this basis be\r\nmatched by the sunshine streaming on to a square mile or so. A\r\nsteamship might be propelled by the heat that scorches its decks.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries inventors have tried to utilise this huge waste\r\npower. We all know how, according to the story, Archimedes burnt up\r\nthe Roman ships besieging his native town, Syracuse, by concentrating\r\non them the sun heat cast from hundreds of mirrors. This story is less\r\nprobable than interesting as a proof that the ancients were aware of\r\nthe sun’s power. The first genuine solar machine was the work of\r\nEricsson, the builder of the _Monitor_. He focused sun heat on a\r\nboiler, which gave the equivalent of one horse-power for every hundred\r\nsquare feet of mirrors employed. This was not what engineers would\r\ncall a “high efficiency,” a great deal of heat being wasted, but it\r\nled the way to further improvements.\r\n\r\nIn America, especially in the dry, arid regions, where fuel is scarce\r\nand the sun shines pitilessly day after day, all the year round,\r\nsun-catchers of various types have been erected and worked\r\nsuccessfully. Dr. William Calver, of Washington, has built in the\r\nbarren wastes of Arizona huge frames of mirrors, travelling on\r\ncircular rails, so that they may be brought to face the sun at all\r\nhours between sunrise and sunset. Dr. Calver employs no less than 1600\r\nmirrors. As each of these mirrors develops 10-15 degrees of heat it is\r\nobvious, after an appeal to simple arithmetic, that the united efforts\r\nof these reflectors should produce the tremendous temperature\r\n16,000-24,000 degrees, which, expressed comparatively, means the\r\npaltry 90 degrees in the shade beneath which we grow restive\r\nmultiplied hundreds of times. Hitherto the greatest known heat had\r\nbeen that of the arc of the electric lamp, in which the incandescent\r\nparticles between pole and pole attain 6000 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe combined effect of the burning mirrors is irresistible. They can,\r\nwe are told, in a few moments reduce Russian iron to the consistency\r\nof warmed wax, though it mocks the heat of many blast-furnaces. They\r\nwill bake bricks twenty times as rapidly as any kiln, and the bricks\r\nproduced are not the friable blocks which a mason chips easily with\r\nhis trowel, but bodies so hard as to scratch case-hardened steel.\r\n\r\nThere are at work in California sun-motors of another design. The\r\nreader must imagine a huge conical lamp-shade turned over on to its\r\nsmaller end, its inner surface lined with nearly 1800 mirrors 2 feet\r\nlong and 3 inches broad, the whole supported on a light iron\r\nframework, and he will have a good idea of the apparatus used on the\r\nPasadena ostrich farm. The machine is arranged _in meridian_, that is,\r\nat right angles to the path of the sun, which it follows all day long\r\nby the agency of clockwork. In the focus of the mirrors is a boiler,\r\n13 feet 6 inches long, coated with black, heat-absorbing substances.\r\nThis boiler holds over 100 gallons of water, and being fed\r\nautomatically will raise steam untended all the day through. The steam\r\nis led by pipes to an engine working a pump, capable of delivering\r\n1400 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nThe cheapness of the apparatus in proportion to its utility is so\r\nmarked that, in regions where sunshine is almost perpetual, the solar\r\nmotor will in time become as common as are windmills and factory\r\nchimneys elsewhere. If the heat falling on a few square yards of\r\nmirror lifts nearly 100,000 gallons of water an hour, there is indeed\r\nhope for the Sahara, the Persian Desert, Arabia, Mongolia, Mexico,\r\nAustralia. That is to say, if the water under the earth be in these\r\nparts as plentiful as the sunshine above it. The effect of water on\r\nthe most unpromising soil is marvellous. Already in Algeria the French\r\nhave reclaimed thousands of square miles by scientific irrigation. In\r\nAustralia huge artesian wells have made habitable for man and beast\r\nmillions of acres that were before desert.\r\n\r\nIt is only a just retribution that the sun should be harnessed and\r\ncompelled to draw water for tracts to which he has so long denied it.\r\nThe sun-motor is only just entering on its useful career, and at\r\npresent we can but dream of the great effects it may have on future\r\ncivilisation. Yet its principle is so simple, so scientific, and so\r\nobvious, that it is easy to imagine it at no far distant date a\r\ndangerous rival to King Coal himself. To quarry coal from the bowels\r\nof the earth and transform it into heat, is to traverse two sides of a\r\ntriangle, the third being to use the sunshine of the passing hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong common phenomena few are more interesting than the changes\r\nundergone by the substance called water. Its usual form is a liquid.\r\nUnder the influence of frost it becomes hard as iron, brittle as\r\nglass. At the touch of fire it passes into unsubstantial vapour.\r\n\r\nThis transformation illustrates the great principle that the form of\r\nevery substance in the universe is a question of heat. A metal\r\ntransported from the earth to the sun would first melt and then\r\nvaporise; while what we here know only as vapours would in the moon\r\nturn into liquids.\r\n\r\nWe notice that, as regards bulk, the most striking change is from\r\nliquid to gaseous form. In steam the atoms and molecules of water are\r\nendowed with enormous repulsive vigour. Each atom suddenly shows a\r\nhuge distaste for the company of its neighbours, drives them off, and\r\nendeavours to occupy the largest possible amount of private space.\r\n\r\nNow, though we are accustomed to see water-atoms thus stirred into an\r\nactivity which gives us the giant steam as servant, it has probably\r\nfallen to the lot of but few of us to encounter certain gaseous\r\nsubstances so utterly deprived of their self-assertiveness as to\r\ncollapse into a liquid mass, in which shape they are quite strangers\r\nto us. What gaseous body do we know better than the air we breathe?\r\nand what should we less expect to be reducible to the consistency of\r\nwater? Yet science has lately brought prominently into notice that\r\nstrange child of pressure and cold, Liquid Air; of which great things\r\nare prophesied, and about which many strange facts may be told.\r\n\r\nVery likely our readers have sometimes noticed a porter uncoupling the\r\nair-tube between two railway carriages. He first turns off the tap at\r\neach end of the tube, and then by a twist disconnects a joint in the\r\ncentre. At the moment of disconnection what appears to be a small\r\ncloud of steam issues from the joint. This is, however, the result of\r\ncold, not heat, the tube being full of highly-compressed air, which by\r\nits sudden expansion develops cold sufficient to freeze any particles\r\nof moisture in the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nKeep this in mind, and also what happens when you inflate your\r\ncycle-tyre. The air-pump grows hotter and hotter as inflation\r\nproceeds: until at last, if of metal, it becomes uncomfortably warm.\r\nThe heat is caused by the forcing together of air-molecules, and\r\ninasmuch as all force produces heat, your strength is transformed into\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nIn these two operations, compression and expansion, we have the key to\r\nthe creation of liquid air--the great power, as some say, of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Liquid Air Co._\r\n\r\n_A view of the Liquid Air Co.’s factory at Pimlico. On the left are\r\nthe three compressors, squeezing the air at pressures of 90, 500 and\r\n2,200 lbs. to the square inch respectively. On the right is the\r\nreservoir in which the liquid is stored._]\r\n\r\nSuppose we take a volume of air and squeeze it into 1/100 of its\r\noriginal space. The combativeness of the air-atoms is immensely\r\nincreased. They pound each other frantically, and become very hot in\r\nthe process. Now, by cooling the vessel in which they are, we rob them\r\nof their energy. They become quiet, but they are much closer than\r\nbefore. Then imagine that all of a sudden we let them loose again. The\r\nlife is gone out of them, their heat has departed, and on separating\r\nthey shiver grievously. In other words, the heat contained by the\r\n1/100 volume is suddenly compelled to “spread itself thin” over the\r\nwhole volume: result--intense cold. And if this air be brought to bear\r\nupon a second vessel filled likewise with compressed air, the cold\r\nwill be even more intense, until at last the air-atoms lose all their\r\nstrength and collapse into a liquid.\r\n\r\nLiquid air is no new thing. Who first made it is uncertain. The credit\r\nhas been claimed for several people, among them Olzewski, a Pole, and\r\nPictet, a Swiss. As a mere laboratory experiment the manufacture of\r\nliquid air in small quantities has been known for twenty years or\r\nmore. The earlier process was one of terrific compression alone,\r\nactually forcing the air molecules by sheer strength into such close\r\ncontact that their antagonism to one another was temporarily overcome.\r\nSo expensive was the process that the first ounce of liquid air is\r\nestimated to have cost over £600!\r\n\r\nIn order to make liquid air an article of commerce the most important\r\ncondition was a wholesale decrease in cost of production. In 1857 C.\r\nW. Siemens took out a patent for making the liquid on what is known as\r\nthe regenerative principle, whereby the compressed air is chilled by\r\nexpanding a part of it. Professor Dewar--a scientist well known for\r\nhis researches in the field of liquid gases--had in 1892 produced\r\nliquid air by a modification of the principle at comparatively small\r\ncost; and other inventors have since then still further reduced the\r\nexpense, until at the present day there appears to be a prospect of\r\nliquid air becoming cheap enough to prove a dangerous rival to steam\r\nand electricity.\r\n\r\nA company, known as the Liquid Air, Power and Automobile Company, has\r\nestablished large plants in America and England for the manufacture of\r\nthe liquid on a commercial scale. The writer paid a visit to their\r\ndepot in Gillingham Street, London, where he was shown the process by\r\nMr. Hans Knudsen, the inventor of much of the machinery there used.\r\nThe reader will doubtless like to learn the “plain, unvarnished truth”\r\nabout the creation of this peculiar liquid, and to hear of the freaks\r\nin which it indulges--if indeed those may be called freaks which are\r\nbut obedience to the unchanging laws of Nature.\r\n\r\nOn entering the factory the first thing that strikes the eye and ear\r\nis the monstrous fifty horse-power gas-engine, pounding away with an\r\nenergy that shakes the whole building. From its ponderous flywheels\r\ngreat leather belts pass to the compressors, three in number, by which\r\nthe air, drawn from outside the building through special purifiers, is\r\nsubjected to an increasing pressure. Three dials on the wall show\r\nexactly what is going on inside the compressors. The first stands at\r\n90 lbs. to the square inch, the second at 500, and the third at 2200,\r\nor rather less than a ton pressure on the area of a penny! The pistons\r\nof the low-pressure compressor is ten inches in diameter, but that of\r\nthe high pressure only two inches, or 1/25 of the area, so great is\r\nthe resistance to be overcome in the last stage of compression.\r\n\r\nNow, if the cycle-pump heats our hands, it will be easily understood\r\nthat the temperature of the compressors is very high. They are\r\nwater-jacketed like the cylinders of a gas-engine, so that a\r\ncirculating stream of cold water may absorb some of the heat. The\r\ncompressed air is passed through spiral tubes winding through large\r\ntanks of water which fairly boils from the fierceness of the heat of\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nWhen the air has been sufficiently cooled it is allowed to pass into a\r\nsmall chamber, expanding as it goes, and from the small into a larger\r\nchamber, where the cold of expansion becomes so acute that the\r\nair-molecules collapse into liquid, which collects in a special\r\nreceptacle. Arrangements are made whereby any vapour rising from the\r\nliquid passes through a space outside the expansion chambers, so that\r\nit helps to cool the incoming air and is not wasted.\r\n\r\nThe liquid-air tank is inside a great wooden case, carefully protected\r\nfrom the heat of the atmosphere by non-conducting substances. A tap\r\nbeing turned, a rush of vapour shoots out, soon followed by a clear,\r\nbluish liquid, which is the air we breathe in a fresh guise.\r\n\r\nA quantity of it is collected in a saucepan. It simmers at first, and\r\npresently boils like water on a fire. The air-heat is _by comparison_\r\nso great that the liquid cannot resist it, and strives to regain its\r\nformer condition.\r\n\r\nYou may dip your finger into the saucepan--if you withdraw it again\r\nquickly--without hurt. The cushion of air that your finger takes in\r\nwith it protects you against harm--for a moment. But if you held it in\r\nthe liquid for a couple of seconds you would be minus a digit. Pour a\r\nlittle over your coat sleeve. It flows harmlessly to the ground, where\r\nit suddenly expands into a cloud of chilly vapour.\r\n\r\nPut some in a test tube and cork it up. The cork soon flies out with a\r\nreport--the pressure of the boiling air drives it. Now watch the\r\nboiling process. The nitrogen being more volatile--as it boils at a\r\nlower temperature than oxygen--passes off first, leaving the pure,\r\nblue oxygen. The temperature of this liquid is over 312 degrees below\r\nzero (as far below the temperature of the air we breathe as the\r\ntemperature of molten lead is above it!). A tumbler of liquid oxygen\r\ndipped into water is soon covered with a coating of ice, which can be\r\ndetached from the tumbler and itself used as a cup to hold the liquid.\r\nIf a bit of steel wire be now twisted round a lighted match and the\r\nwhole dipped into the cup, the steel flares fiercely and fuses into\r\nsmall pellets; which means that an operation requiring 3000 degrees\r\nFahrenheit has been accomplished in a liquid 300 degrees below zero!\r\n\r\nLiquid air has curious effects upon certain substances. It makes iron\r\nso brittle that a ladle immersed for a few moments may be crushed in\r\nthe hands; but, curiously enough, it has a toughening effect on copper\r\nand brass. Meat, eggs, fruit, and all bodies containing water become\r\nhard as steel and as breakable as glass. Mercury is by it congealed to\r\nthe consistency of iron; even alcohol, that can brave the utmost\r\nArctic cold, succumbs to it. The writer was present when some\r\nthermometers, manufactured by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, were tested\r\nwith liquid air. The spirit in the tubes rapidly descended to 250\r\ndegrees below zero, then sank slowly, and at about 260 degrees froze\r\nand burst the bulb. The measuring of such extreme temperatures is a\r\nvery difficult matter in consequence of the inability of spirit to\r\nwithstand them, and special apparatus, registering cold by the\r\nshrinkage of metal, must be used for testing some liquid gases,\r\nnotably liquid hydrogen, which is so much colder than liquid air that\r\nit actually freezes it into a solid ice form!\r\n\r\nFor handling and transporting liquid gases glass receptacles with a\r\ndouble skin from which all air has been exhausted are employed. The\r\nsurrounding vacuum is so perfect an insulator that a “Dewar bulb” full\r\nof liquid air scarcely cools the hand, though the intervening space is\r\nless than an inch. This fact is hard to square with the assertion of\r\nscientific men that our atmosphere extends but a hundred or two miles\r\nfrom the earth’s surface, and that the recesses of space are a vacuum.\r\nIf it were so, how would heat reach us from the sun, ninety-two\r\nmillions of miles away?\r\n\r\nOne use at least for liquid air is sufficiently obvious. As a\r\nrefrigerating agent it is unequalled. Bulk for bulk its effect is of\r\ncourse far greater than that of ice; and it has this advantage over\r\nother freezing compounds, that whereas slow freezing has a destructive\r\neffect upon the tissues of meat and fruit, the instantaneous action of\r\nliquid air has no bad results when the thing frozen is thawed out\r\nagain. The Liquid Air Company therefore proposes erecting depôts at\r\nlarge ports for supplying ships, to preserve the food, cool the cabins\r\nin the tropics, and, we hope, to alleviate some of the horrors of the\r\nstokehold.\r\n\r\nLiquid air is already used in medical and surgical science. In surgery\r\nit is substituted for anæsthetics, deadening any part of the body on\r\nwhich an operation has to be performed. In fever hospitals, too, its\r\ncooling influence will be welcomed; and liquid oxygen takes the places\r\nof compressed oxygen for reviving the flickering flame of life. It\r\nwill also prove invaluable for divers and submarine boats.\r\n\r\nIn combination with oil and charcoal liquid air, under the name of\r\n“oxyliquit,” becomes a powerful blasting agent. Cartridges of paper\r\nfilled with the oil and charcoal are provided with a firing primer.\r\nWhen everything is ready for the blasting the cartridges are dropped\r\ninto a vessel full of liquid air, saturated, placed in position, and\r\nexploded. Mr. Knudsen assured the writer that oxyliquit is twice as\r\npowerful as nitro-glycerine, and its cost but one-third of that of the\r\nother explosive. It is also safer to handle, for in case of a misfire\r\nthe cartridge becomes harmless in a few minutes, after the liquid air\r\nhas evaporated.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest use will be found for liquid air when it exerts its\r\nforce less violently. It is the result of power; its condition is\r\nabnormal; and its return to its ordinary state is accompanied by a\r\ngreat development of energy. If it be placed in a closed vessel it is\r\ncapable of exerting a pressure of 12,000 lbs. to the square inch. Its\r\nreturn to atmospheric condition may be regulated by exposing it more\r\nor less to the heat of the atmosphere. So long as it remains liquid\r\nit represents so much _stored force_, like the electricity stored in\r\naccumulators. The Liquid Air Company have at their Gillingham Street\r\ndepôt a neat little motor car worked by liquid air. A copper\r\nreservoir, carefully protected, is filled with the liquid, which is by\r\nmechanical means squirted into coils, in which it rapidly expands, and\r\nfrom them passes to the cylinders. A charge of eighteen gallons will\r\nmove the car forty miles at an average pace of twelve miles an hour,\r\nwithout any of the noise, dirt, smell, or vapour inseparable from the\r\nemployment of steam or petroleum. The speed of the car is regulated by\r\nthe amount of liquid injected into the expansion coils.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the question of cost--the unromantic balance in which\r\nnew discoveries are weighed and many found wanting. The storage of\r\nliquid air is feasible for long periods. (A large vacuum bulb filled\r\nand exposed to the atmosphere had some of the liquid still\r\nunevaporated at the end of twenty-two days.) But will it be too costly\r\nfor ordinary practical purposes now served by steam and electricity?\r\nThe managers of the Liquid Air Company, while deprecating extravagant\r\nprophecies about the future of their commodity, are nevertheless\r\nconfident that it has “come to stay.” With the small 50 horse-power\r\nplant its production costs upwards of one shilling a gallon, but with\r\nmuch larger plant of 1000 horse-power they calculate that the expenses\r\nwill be covered and a profit left if they retail it at but one penny\r\nthe gallon. This great reduction in cost arises from the economising\r\nof “waste energy.” In the first place the power of expansion previous\r\nto the liquefaction of the compressed air will be utilised to work\r\nmotors. Secondly, the heat of the cooling tanks will be turned to\r\naccount, and even the “exhaust” of a motor would be cold enough for\r\nordinary refrigerating. It is, of course, impossible to get more out\r\nof a thing than has been put into it; and liquid air will therefore\r\nnot develop even as much power as was required to form it. But its\r\nhandiness and cleanliness strongly recommend it for many purposes, as\r\nwe have seen; and as soon as it is turned out in large quantities new\r\nuses will be found for it. Perhaps the day will come when liquid-air\r\nmotors will replace the petrol car, and in every village we shall see\r\nhung out the sign, “Liquid air sold here.” As the French say, “_Qui\r\nvivra verra_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSELESS CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA body of enterprising Manchester merchants, in the year 1754, put on\r\nthe road a “flying coach,” which, according to their special\r\nadvertisement, would, “however incredible it may appear, actually,\r\nbarring accidents, arrive in London in four and a half days after\r\nleaving Manchester.” According to the Lord Chancellor of the time such\r\nswift travelling was considered dangerous as well as wonderful--the\r\ncondition of the roads might well make it so--and also injurious to\r\nhealth. “I was gravely advised,” he says, “to stay a day in York on my\r\njourney between Edinburgh and London, as several passengers who had\r\ngone through without stopping had died of apoplexy from the rapidity\r\nof the motion.”\r\n\r\nAs the coach took a fortnight to pass from the Scotch to the English\r\ncapital, at an average pace of between three and four miles an hour,\r\nit is probable that the Chancellor’s advisers would be very seriously\r\nindisposed by the mere sight of a motor-car whirling along in its\r\nattendant cloud of dust, could they be resuscitated for the purpose.\r\nAnd we, on the other hand, should prefer to get out and walk to\r\n“flying” at the safe speed of their mail coaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Speedwell Motor Co._\r\n\r\n_M. Serpollet on the “Easter Egg,” which at Nice covered a kilometre\r\nin the record time of 29-4/5 secs. (over 75 miles per hour). This car\r\nis run with steam._]\r\n\r\nThe improvement of highroads, and road-making generally, accelerated\r\nthe rate of posting. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century an\r\naverage of ten or even twelve miles an hour was maintained on the Bath\r\nRoad. But that pace was considered inadequate when the era of the\r\n“iron horse” commenced, and the decay of stage-driving followed hard\r\nupon the growth of railways. What should have been the natural\r\nsuccessor of the stage-coach was driven from the road by ill-advised\r\nlegislation, which gave the railroads a monopoly of swift transport,\r\nwhich has but lately been removed.\r\n\r\nThe history of the steam-coach, steam-carriage, automobile,\r\nmotor-car--to give it its successive names--is in a manner unique,\r\nshowing as it does, instead of steady development of a practical means\r\nof locomotion, a sudden and decisive check to an invention worthy of\r\nfar better treatment than it received. The compiler of even a short\r\nsurvey of the automobile’s career is obliged to divide his account\r\ninto two main portions, linked together by a few solitary engineering\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nThe first period (1800-1836), will, without any desire to arrogate for\r\nEngland more than her due or to belittle the efforts of any other\r\nnations, be termed the English period, since in it England took the\r\nlead, and produced by far the greatest number of steam-carriages. The\r\nsecond (1870 to the present day) may, with equal justice, be styled\r\nthe Continental period, as witnessing the great developments made in\r\nautomobilism by French, German, Belgian, and American engineers:\r\nEngland, for reasons that will be presently noticed, being until quite\r\nrecently too heavily handicapped to take a part in the advance.\r\n\r\n_Historical._--It is impossible to discover who made the first\r\nself-moving carriage. In the sixteenth century one Johann Haustach, a\r\nNuremberg watchmaker, produced a vehicle that derived its motive power\r\nfrom coiled springs, and was in fact a large edition of our modern\r\nclockwork toys. About the same time the Dutch, and among them\r\nespecially one Simon Stevin, fitted carriages with sails, and there\r\nare records of a steam-carriage as early as the same century.\r\n\r\nBut the first practical, and at least semi-successful, automobile\r\ndriven by internal force was undoubtedly that of a Frenchman, Nicholas\r\nJoseph Cugnot, who justly merits the title of father of automobilism.\r\nHis machine, which is to-day one of the most treasured exhibits in the\r\nParis Museum of Arts and Crafts, consisted of a large carriage, having\r\nin front a pivoted platform bearing the machinery, and resting on a\r\nsolid wheel, which propelled as well as steered the vehicle. The\r\nboiler, of stout riveted copper plates, had below it an enclosed\r\nfurnace, from which the flames passed upwards through the water\r\nthrough a funnel. A couple of cylinders, provided with a simple\r\nreversing gear, worked a ratchet that communicated motion to the\r\ndriving-wheel. This carriage did not travel beyond a very slow walking\r\npace, and Cugnot therefore added certain improvements, after which\r\n(1770) it reached the still very moderate speed of four miles an hour,\r\nand distinguished itself by charging and knocking down a wall, a feat\r\nthat is said to have for a time deterred engineers from developing a\r\nseemingly dangerous mode of progression.\r\n\r\nTen years later Dallery built a steam car, and ran it in the streets\r\nof Amiens--we are not told with what success; and before any further\r\nadvance had been made with the automobile the French Revolution put a\r\nstop to all inventions of a peaceful character among our neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn England, however, steam had already been recognised as the coming\r\npower. Richard Trevethick, afterwards to become famous as a railroad\r\nengineer, built a steam motor in 1802, and actually drove it from\r\nCambourne to Plymouth, a distance of ninety miles. But instead of\r\nfollowing up this success, he forsook steam-carriages for the\r\nconstruction of locomotives, leaving his idea to be expanded by other\r\nmen, who were convinced that a vehicle which could be driven over\r\nexisting roads was preferable to one that was helpless when separated\r\nfrom smooth metal rails. Between the years 1800 and 1836 many steam\r\nvehicles for road traffic appeared from time to time, some, such as\r\nDavid Gordon’s (propelled by metal legs pressing upon the ground),\r\nstrangely unpractical, but the majority showing a steady improvement\r\nin mechanical design.\r\n\r\nAs it will be impossible, without writing a small book, to name all\r\nthe English constructors of this period, we must rest content with the\r\nmention of the leading pioneers of the new locomotion.\r\n\r\nSir Goldsworthy Gurney, an eminent chemist, did for mechanical road\r\npropulsion what George Stephenson was doing for railway development.\r\nHe boldly spent large sums on experimental vehicles, which took the\r\nform of six-wheeled coaches. The earliest of these were fitted with\r\nlegs as well as driving-wheels, since he thought that in difficult\r\ncountry wheels alone would not have sufficient grip. (A similar\r\nfallacy was responsible for the cogged wheels on the first railways.)\r\nBut in the later types legs were abandoned as unnecessary. His coaches\r\neasily climbed the steepest hills round London, including Highgate\r\nHill, though a thoughtful mathematician had proved by calculations\r\nthat a steam-carriage, so far from mounting a gradient, could not,\r\nwithout violating all natural laws, so much as move itself on the\r\nlevel!\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself of their power, Gurney took his coaches\r\nfurther afield. In 1829 was published the first account of a motor\r\ntrip made by him and three companions through Reading, Devizes, and\r\nMelksham. The pace was, we read, at first only about six miles an\r\nhour, including stoppages. They drove very carefully to avoid injury\r\nto the persons or feelings of the country folk; but at Melksham, where\r\na fair was in progress, they had to face a shower of stones, hurled by\r\na crowd of roughs at the instigation of some coaching postilions, who\r\nfeared losing their livelihood if the new method of locomotion became\r\ngeneral. Two of the tourists were severely hurt, and Gurney was\r\nobliged to take shelter in a brewery, where constables guarded his\r\ncoach. On the return journey the party timed their movements so as to\r\npass through Melksham while the inhabitants were all safely in bed.\r\n\r\nThe coach ran most satisfactorily, improving every mile. “Our pace was\r\nso rapid,” wrote one of the company, “that the horses of the mail-cart\r\nwhich accompanied us were hard put to it to keep up with us. At the\r\nfoot of Devizes Hill we met a coach and another vehicle, which stopped\r\nto see us mount this hill, an extremely steep one. We ascended it at a\r\nrapid rate. The coach and passengers, delighted at this unexpected\r\nsight, honoured us with shouts of applause.”\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Messrs. Ogle and Summers completely beat the road record on a\r\nvehicle fitted with a tubular boiler. This car, put through its trials\r\nbefore a Special Commission of the House of Commons, attained the\r\nastonishing speed of 35 miles an hour on the level, and mounted a hill\r\nnear Southampton at 24-1/2 miles an hour. It worked at a boiler\r\npressure of 250 lbs. to the square inch, and though not hung on\r\nsprings, ran 800 miles without a breakdown. This performance appears\r\nall the more extraordinary when we remember the roads of that day were\r\nnot generally as good as they are now, and that in the previous year\r\nStephenson’s “Rocket,” running on rails, had not reached a higher\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Parliamentary Commission on horseless carriages was\r\nmost favourable. It urged that the steam-driven car was swifter and\r\nlighter than the mail-coaches; better able to climb and descend hills;\r\nsafer; more economical; and less injurious to the roads; and, in\r\nconclusion, that the heavy charges levied at the toll-gates (often\r\ntwenty times those on horse vehicles) were nothing short of\r\niniquitous.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this report, motor services, inaugurated by Walter\r\nHancock, Braithwayte, and others, commenced between Paddington and the\r\nBank, London and Greenwich, London and Windsor, London and Stratford.\r\nAlready, in 1829, Sir Charles Dance had a steam-coach running between\r\nCheltenham and Gloucester. In four months it ran 3500 miles and\r\ncarried 3000 passengers, traversing the nine miles in three-quarters\r\nof an hour; although narrow-minded landowners placed ridges of stone\r\neighteen inches deep on the road by way of protest.\r\n\r\nThe most ambitious service of all was that between London and\r\nBirmingham, established in 1833 by Dr. Church. The rolling-stock\r\nconsisted of a single very much decorated coach.\r\n\r\nThe success of the road-steamer seemed now assured, when a cloud\r\nappeared on the horizon. It had already been too successful. The\r\nrailway companies were up in arms. They saw plainly that if once the\r\nroads were covered with vehicles able to transport the public at low\r\nfares quickly from door to door on existing thoroughfares, the\r\nconstruction of expensive railroads would be seriously hindered, if\r\nnot altogether stopped. So, taking advantage of two motor accidents,\r\nthe companies appealed to Parliament--full of horse-loving squires and\r\nmanufacturers, who scented profit in the railways--and though\r\nscientific opinion ran strongly in favour of the steam-coach, a law\r\nwas passed in 1836 which rendered the steamers harmless by robbing\r\nthem of their speed. The fiat went forth that in future _every road\r\nlocomotive should be preceded at a distance of a hundred yards by a\r\nman on foot carrying a red flag to warn passengers of its approach_.\r\nThis law marks the end of the first period of automobilism as far as\r\nEngland is concerned. At one blow it crippled a great industry,\r\ndeprived the community of a very valuable means of transport, and\r\ncrushed the energies of many clever inventors who would soon, if we\r\nmay judge by the rapid advances already made in construction, have\r\nbrought the steam-carriage to a high pitch of perfection. In the very\r\nyear in which they were suppressed the steam services had proved their\r\nefficiency and safety. Hancock’s London service alone traversed 4200\r\nmiles without serious accident, and was so popular that the coaches\r\nwere generally crowded. It is therefore hard to believe that these\r\nvehicles did not supply a public want, or that they were regarded by\r\nthose who used them as in any way inferior to horse-drawn coaches.\r\nYet ignorant prejudice drove them off the road for sixty years; and\r\nto-day it surprises many Englishmen to learn that what is generally\r\nconsidered a novel method of travelling was already fairly well\r\ndeveloped in the time of their grandfathers.\r\n\r\n_Second Period_ (1870 onwards).--To follow the further development of\r\nthe automobile we must cross the Channel once again. French invention\r\nhad not been idle while Gurney and Hancock were building their\r\ncoaches. In 1835 M. Dietz established a service between Versailles and\r\nParis, and the same year M. D’Asda carried out some successful trials\r\nof his steam “diligence” under the eyes of Royalty. But we find that\r\nfor the next thirty-five years the steam-carriage was not much\r\nimproved, owing to want of capital among its French admirers. No\r\nGurney appeared, ready to spend his thousands in experimenting; also,\r\nthough the law left road locomotion unrestricted, the railways offered\r\na determined opposition to a possibly dangerous rival. So that, on the\r\nwhole, road transport by steam fared badly till after the terrible\r\nFranco-Prussian war, when inventors again took courage. M. Bollée, of\r\nMans, built in 1873 a car, “l’Obéissante,” which ran from Mans to\r\nParis; and became the subject of allusions in popular songs and plays,\r\nwhile its name was held up as an example to the Paris ladies. Three\r\nyears later he constructed a steam omnibus to carry fifty persons, and\r\nin 1878 exhibited a car that journeyed at the rate of eighteen miles\r\nan hour from Paris to Vienna, where it aroused great admiration.\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1880 French engineers divided their attention between\r\nthe heavy motor omnibus and light vehicles for pleasure parties. In\r\n1884 MM. Bouton and Trépardoux, working conjointly with the Comte de\r\nDion, produced a steam-driven tricycle, and in 1887 M. Serpollet\r\nfollowed suit with another, fitted with the peculiar form of steam\r\ngenerator that bears his name. Then came in 1890 a very important\r\ninnovation, which has made automobilism what it now is. Gottlieb\r\nDaimler, a German engineer, introduced the _petrol gas-motor_. Its\r\ncomparative lightness and simplicity at once stamped it as the thing\r\nfor which makers were waiting. Petrol-driven vehicles were soon abroad\r\nin considerable numbers and varieties, but they did not attract public\r\nattention to any great extent until, in 1894, M. Pierre Giffard, an\r\neditor of the _Petit Journal_, organised a motor race from Paris to\r\nRouen. The proprietors of the paper offered handsome prizes to the\r\nsuccessful competitors. There were ten starters, some on steam, others\r\non petrol cars. The race showed that, so far as stability went,\r\nDaimler’s engine was the equal of the steam cylinder. The next year\r\nanother race of a more ambitious character was held, the course being\r\nfrom Paris to Bordeaux and back. Subscriptions for prizes flowed in\r\nfreely. Serpollet, de Dion, and Bollée prepared steam cars that should\r\nwin back for steam its lost supremacy, while the petrol faction\r\nsecretly built motors of a strength to relegate steam once and for all\r\nto a back place. Electricity, too, made a bid unsuccessfully for the\r\nprize in the Jeantaud car, a special train being engaged in advance to\r\ndistribute charged accumulators over the route. The steamers broke\r\ndown soon after the start, so that the petrol cars “walked over” and\r\nwon a most decisive victory.\r\n\r\nThe interest roused in the race led the Comte de Dion to found the\r\nAutomobile Club of France, which drew together all the enthusiastic\r\nadmirers of the new locomotion. Automobilism now became a sport, a\r\ncraze. The French, with their fine straight roads, and a not too\r\ndeeply ingrained love of horseflesh, gladly welcomed the flying car,\r\ndespite its noisy and malodorous properties.\r\n\r\nOrders flowed in so freely that the motor makers could not keep pace\r\nwith the demand, or promise delivery within eighteen months. Rich men\r\nwere therefore obliged to pay double prices if they could find any one\r\nwilling to sell--a state of things that remains unto this day with\r\ncertain makes of French cars. Poorer folks contented themselves with\r\nDe Dion motor tricycles, which showed up so well in the 1896\r\nParis-Marseilles race; or with the neat little three-wheeled cars of\r\nM. Bollée. Motor racing became the topic of the hour. Journals were\r\nstarted for the sole purpose of recording the doings of motorists; and\r\nfew newspapers of any popularity omitted a special column of motor\r\nnews. Successive contests on the highroads at increasing speeds\r\nattracted increased interest. The black-goggled, fur-clad _chauffeur_\r\nwho carried off the prizes found himself a hero.\r\n\r\nIn short, the hold which automobilism has over our neighbours may be\r\ngauged from the fact that in 1901 it was estimated that nearly a\r\nthousand motor cars assembled to see the sport on the Longchamps\r\nCourse (the scene of that ultra-“horsey” event, the Grand Prix), and\r\nthe real interest of the meet did not centre round horses of flesh and\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe French have not a monopoly of devotion to automobilism. The speedy\r\nmotor car is too much in accord with the bustling spirit of the age;\r\nits delights too easily appreciated to be confined to one country.\r\nAllowing France the first place, America, Germany, and Belgium are not\r\nfar behind in their addiction to the “sport,” and even in Britain,\r\npartially freed since 1896 from the red-flag tyranny, thanks to the\r\nefforts of Sir David Salomons, there are most visible signs that the\r\nera of the horse is beginning its end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF CAR.\r\n\r\nAutomobiles may be classified according to the purpose they serve,\r\naccording to their size and weight, or according to their motive\r\npower. We will first review them under the latter head.\r\n\r\n_A. Petrol._--The petrol motor, suitable alike for large cars of 40\r\nto 60 horse-power and for the small bicycle weighing 70 lbs. or so, at\r\npresent undoubtedly occupies the first place in popular estimation on\r\naccount of its comparative simplicity, which more than compensates\r\ncertain defects that affect persons off the vehicle more than those on\r\nit--smell and noise.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the internal explosion motor is that at one\r\noperation it converts fuel directly into energy, by exploding it\r\ninside a cylinder. It is herein more economical than steam, which\r\nloses power while passing from the boiler to the driving-gear.\r\n\r\nPetrol cycles and small cars have usually only one cylinder, but large\r\nvehicles carry two, three, and sometimes four cylinders. Four and more\r\navoid that bugbear of rotary motion, “dead points,” during which the\r\nmomentum of the machinery alone is doing work; and for that reason the\r\nengines of racing cars are often quadrupled.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity we will describe the working of a single\r\ncylinder, leaving the reader to imagine it acting alone or in concert\r\nwith others as he pleases.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the fuel, petrol, is a very inflammable\r\ndistillation of petroleum: so ready to ignite that it must be most\r\nrigorously guarded from naked lights; so quick to evaporate that the\r\nreceptacles containing it, if not quite airtight, will soon render it\r\n“stale” and unprofitable for motor driving.\r\n\r\nThe engine, to mention its most important parts, consists of a\r\nsingle-action cylinder (giving a thrust one way only); a heavy\r\nflywheel revolving in an airtight circular case, and connected to the\r\npiston by a hinged rod which converts the reciprocating movement of\r\nthe piston into a rotary movement of the crank-shaft built in with the\r\nwheel; inlet and outlet valves; a carburettor for generating petrol\r\ngas, and a device to ignite the gas-and-air mixture in the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe action of the engine is as follows: as the piston moves outwards\r\nin its first stroke it sucks through the inlet valve a quantity of\r\nmixed air and gas, the proportions of which are regulated by special\r\ntaps. The stroke ended, the piston returns, compressing the mixture\r\nand rendering it more combustible. Just as the piston commences its\r\nsecond outward stroke an electric spark passed through the mixture\r\nmechanically ignites it, and creates an explosion, which drives the\r\npiston violently forwards. The second return forces the burnt gas\r\nthrough the exhaust-valve, which is lifted by cog-gear once in every\r\ntwo revolutions of the crank, into the “silencer.” The cycle of\r\noperations is then repeated.\r\n\r\nWe see that during three-quarters of the “cycle”--the suction,\r\ncompression, and expulsion--the work is performed entirely by the\r\nflywheel. It follows that a single-cylinder motor, to work at all,\r\nmust rotate the wheel at a high rate. Once stopped, it can be\r\nrestarted only by the action of the handle or pedals; a task often so\r\nunpleasant and laborious that the driver of a car, when he comes to\r\nrest for a short time only, disconnects his motor from the\r\ndriving-gear and lets it throb away idly beneath him.\r\n\r\nThe means of igniting the gas in the cylinders may be either a Bunsen\r\nburner or an electric spark. Tube ignition is generally considered\r\ninferior to electrical because it does not permit “timing” of the\r\nexplosion. Large cars are often fitted with both systems, so as to\r\nhave one in reserve should the other break down.\r\n\r\nElectrical ignition is most commonly produced by the aid of an\r\nintensity coil, which consists of an inner core of coarse insulated\r\nwire, called the primary coil; and an outer, or secondary coil, of\r\nvery fine wire. A current passes at intervals, timed by a cam on the\r\nexhaust-valve gear working a make-and-break contact blade, from an\r\naccumulator through the primary coil, exciting by induction a current\r\nof much greater intensity in the secondary. The secondary is connected\r\nto a “sparking plug,” which screws into the end of the cylinder, and\r\ncarries two platinum points about 1/32 of an inch apart. The secondary\r\ncurrent leaps this little gap in the circuit, and the spark, being\r\nintensely hot, fires the compressed gas. Instead of accumulators a\r\nsmall dynamo, driven by the motor, is sometimes used to produce the\r\nprimary current.\r\n\r\nBy moving a small lever, known as the “advancing lever,” the driver\r\ncan control the time of explosion relatively to the compression of the\r\ngas, and raise or lower the speed of the motor.\r\n\r\nThe strokes of the petrol-driven cylinder are very rapid, varying from\r\n1000 to 3000 a minute. The heat of very frequent explosions would soon\r\nmake the cylinder too hot to work were not measures adopted to keep it\r\ncool. Small cylinders, such as are carried on motor cycles, are\r\nsufficiently cooled by a number of radiating ribs cast in a piece with\r\nthe cylinder itself; but for large machines a water jacket or tank\r\nsurrounding the cylinder is a necessity. Water is circulated through\r\nthe jacket by means of a small centrifugal pump working off the\r\ndriving gear, and through a coil of pipes fixed in the front of the\r\ncar to catch the draught of progression. So long as the jacket and\r\ntubes are full of water the temperature of the cylinder cannot rise\r\nabove boiling point.\r\n\r\nMotion is transmitted from the motor to the driving-wheels by\r\nintermediate gear, which in cycles may be only a leather band or\r\ncouple of cogs, but in cars is more or less complicated. Under the\r\nbody of the car, running usually across it, is the countershaft,\r\nfitted at each end with a small cog which drives a chain passing also\r\nover much larger cogs fixed to the driving-wheels. The countershaft\r\nengages with the cylinder mechanism by a “friction-clutch,” a couple\r\nof circular faces which can be pressed against one another by a lever.\r\nTo start his car the driver allows the motor to obtain a considerable\r\nmomentum, and then, using the friction lever, brings more and more\r\nstress on to the countershaft until the friction-clutch overcomes the\r\ninertia of the car and produces movement.\r\n\r\nGearing suitable for level stretches would not be sufficiently\r\npowerful for hills: the motor would slow and probably stop from want\r\nof momentum. A car is therefore fitted with changing gears, which give\r\ntwo or three speeds, the lower for ascents, the higher for the level:\r\nand on declines the friction-clutch can be released, allowing the car\r\nto “coast.”\r\n\r\n_B. Steam Cars._--Though the petrol car has come to the front of late\r\nyears it still has a powerful rival in the steam car. Inventors have\r\nmade strenuous efforts to provide steam-engines light enough to be\r\nsuitable for small pleasure cars. At present the Locomobile (American)\r\nand Serpollet (French) systems are increasing their popularity. The\r\nLocomobile, the cost of which (about £120) contrasts favourably with\r\nthat of even the cheaper petrol cars, has a small multitubular boiler\r\nwound on the outside with two or three layers of piano wire, to render\r\nit safe at high pressures. As the boiler is placed under the seat it\r\nis only fit and proper that it should have a large margin of safety.\r\nThe fuel, petrol, is passed through a specially designed burner,\r\npierced with hundreds of fine holes arranged in circles round air\r\ninlets. The feed-supply to the burner is governed by a spring valve,\r\nwhich cuts off the petrol automatically as soon as the steam in the\r\nboiler reaches a certain pressure. The locomobile runs very evenly and\r\nsmoothly, and with very little noise, a welcome change after the very\r\naudible explosion motor.\r\n\r\nThe Serpollet system is a peculiar method of generating steam. The\r\nboiler is merely a long coil of tubing, into which a small jet of\r\nwater is squirted by a pump at every stroke of the cylinders. The\r\nsteam is generated and used in a moment, and the speed of the machine\r\nis regulated by the amount of water thrown by the pumps. By an\r\ningenious device the fuel supply is controlled in combination with the\r\nwater supply, so that there may not be any undue waste in the burner.\r\n\r\n_C. Electricity._--Of electric cars there are many patterns, but at\r\npresent they are not commercially so practical as the other two types.\r\nThe great drawbacks to electrically-driven cars are the weight of the\r\naccumulators (which often scale nearly as much as all the rest of the\r\nvehicle), and the difficulty of getting them recharged when exhausted.\r\nWe might add to these the rapidity with which the accumulators become\r\nworn out, and the consequent expense of renewal. T. A. Edison is\r\nreported at work on an accumulator which will surpass all hitherto\r\nconstructed, having a much longer life, and weighing very much less,\r\npower for power. The longest continuous run ever made with\r\nelectricity, 187 miles at Chicago, compares badly with the feat of a\r\npetrol car which on November 23, 1900, travelled a thousand miles on\r\nthe Crystal Palace track in 48 hours 24 minutes, without a single\r\nstop. Successful attempts have been made by MM. Pieper and Jenatsky to\r\ncombine the petrol and electric systems, by an arrangement which\r\ninstead of wasting power in the cylinders when less speed is required,\r\nthrows into action electric dynamos to store up energy, convertible,\r\nwhen needed, into motive power by reversing the dynamo into a motor.\r\nBut the simple electric car will not be a universal favourite until\r\neither accumulators are so light that a very large store of\r\nelectricity can be carried without inconvenient addition of weight, or\r\nuntil charging stations are erected all over the country at distances\r\nof fifty miles or so apart.\r\n\r\nWhether steam will eventually get the upper hand of the petrol engine\r\nis at present uncertain. The steam car has the advantage over the\r\ngas-engine car in ease of starting, the delicate regulation of power,\r\nfacility of reversing, absence of vibration, noise and smell, and\r\nfreedom from complicated gears. On the other hand the petrol car has\r\nno boiler to get out of order or burst, no troublesome gauges\r\nrequiring constant attention, and there is small difficulty about a\r\nsupply of fuel. Petrol sufficient to give motive power for hundreds of\r\nmiles can be carried if need be; and as long as there is petrol on\r\nboard the car is ready for work at a moment’s notice. Judging by the\r\nnumber of the various types of vehicles actually at work we should\r\nsay that while steam is best for heavy traction, the gas-engine is\r\nmost often employed on pleasure cars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Liquid Air Co._\r\n\r\n_This graceful little motor-car is driven by Liquid Air. It makes\r\nabsolutely no smell or noise._]\r\n\r\n_D. Liquid Air_ will also have to be reckoned with as a motive power.\r\nAt present it is only on its probation; but the writer has good\r\nauthority for stating that before these words appear in print there\r\nwill be on the roads a car driven by liquid air, and able to turn off\r\neighty miles in the hour.\r\n\r\n_Manufacture._--As the English were the pioneers of the steam car, so\r\nare the Germans and French the chief manufacturers of the petrol car.\r\nWhile the hands of English manufacturers were tied by shortsighted\r\nlegislation, continental nations were inventing and controlling\r\nvaluable patents, so that even now our manufacturers are greatly\r\nhandicapped. Large numbers of petrol cars are imported annually from\r\nFrance, Germany, and Belgium. Steam cars come chiefly from America and\r\nFrance. The former country sent us nearly 2000 vehicles in 1901. There\r\nare signs, however, that English engineers mean to make a determined\r\neffort to recover lost ground; and it is satisfactory to learn that in\r\nheavy steam vehicles, such as are turned out by Thorneycroft and Co.,\r\nthis country holds the lead. We will hope that in a few years we shall\r\nbe exporters in turn.\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the history and nature of the various types of car,\r\nit will be interesting to turn to a consideration of their travelling\r\ncapacities. As we have seen, a steam omnibus attained, in 1830, a\r\nspeed of no less than thirty-five miles an hour on what we should call\r\nbad roads. It is therefore to be expected that on good modern roads\r\nthe latest types of car would be able to eclipse the records of\r\nseventy years ago. That such has indeed been the case is evident when\r\nwe examine the performances of cars in races organised as tests of\r\nspeed. France, with its straight, beautifully-kept, military roads, is\r\nthe country _par excellence_ for the _chauffeur_. One has only to\r\nglance at the map to see how the main highways conform to Euclid’s\r\ndictum that a straight line is the shortest distance between any two\r\npoints, _e.g._ between Rouen and Dieppe, where a park of artillery,\r\nwell posted, could rake the road either way for miles.\r\n\r\nThe growth of speed in the French races is remarkable. In 1894 the\r\nwinning car ran at a mean velocity of thirteen miles an hour; in 1895,\r\nof fifteen. The year 1898 witnessed a great advance to twenty-three\r\nmiles, and the next year to thirty miles. But all these speeds paled\r\nbefore that of the Paris to Bordeaux race of 1901, in which the\r\nwinner, M. Fournier, traversed the distance of 327-1/2 miles at a rate\r\nof 53-3/4 miles per hour! The famous Sud express, running between the\r\nsame cities, and considered the fastest long-distance express in the\r\nworld, was beaten by a full hour. It is interesting to note that in\r\nthe same races a motor bicycle, a Werner, weighing 80 lbs. or less,\r\nsuccessfully accomplished the course at an average rate of nearly\r\nthirty miles an hour. The motor-car, after waiting seventy years, had\r\nhad its revenge on the railways.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only occasion on which an express service showed up\r\nbadly against its nimble rival of the roads. In June, 1901, the French\r\nand German authorities forgot old animosities in a common enthusiasm\r\nfor the automobile, and organised a race between Paris and Berlin. It\r\nwas to be a big affair, in which the cars of all nations should fight\r\nfor the speed championship. Every possible precaution was taken to\r\ninsure the safety of the competitors and the spectators. Flags of\r\nvarious colours and placards marked out the course, which lay through\r\nRheims, Luxembourg, Coblentz, Frankfurt, Eisenach, Leipsic, and\r\nPotsdam to the German capital. About fifty towns and large villages\r\nwere “neutralised”--that is to say, the competitors had to consume a\r\ncertain time in traversing them. At the entrance to each neutralised\r\nzone a “control” was established. As soon as a competitor arrived, he\r\nmust slow down, and a card on which was written the time of his\r\narrival was handed to a “pilot,” who cycled in front of the car to the\r\nother “control” at the farther end of the zone, from which, when the\r\nproper time had elapsed, the car was dismissed. Among other rules\r\nwere: that no car should be pushed or pulled during the race by any\r\none else than the passengers; that at the end of the day only a\r\ncertain time should be allowed for cleaning and repairs; and that a\r\nlimited number of persons, varying with the size of the car, should\r\nbe permitted to handle it during that period.\r\n\r\nA small army of automobile club representatives, besides thousands of\r\npolice and soldiers, were distributed along the course to restrain the\r\ncrowds of spectators. It was absolutely imperative that for vehicles\r\npropelled at a rate of from 50 to 60 miles an hour a clear path should\r\nbe kept.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, on July 27th, 109 racing machines assembled at the Fort de\r\nChampigny, outside Paris, in readiness to start for Berlin. Just\r\nbefore half-past three, the first competitor received the signal; two\r\nminutes later the second; and then at short intervals for three hours\r\nthe remaining 107, among whom was one lady, Mme. de Gast. At least\r\n20,000 persons were present, even at that early hour, to give the\r\nracers a hearty farewell, and demonstrate the interest attaching in\r\nFrance to all things connected with automobilism.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement prevailed in Paris during the three days of the race.\r\nEvery few minutes telegrams arrived from posts on the route telling\r\nhow the competitors fared. The news showed that during the first stage\r\nat least a hard fight for the leading place was in progress. The\r\nFrench cracks, Fournier, Charron, De Knyff, Farman, and Girardot\r\npressed hard on Hourgières, No. 2 at the starting-point. Fournier soon\r\nsecured the lead, and those who remembered his remarkable driving in\r\nthe Paris-Bordeaux race at once selected him as the winner.\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, 283 miles from Paris and the end of the first\r\nstage, was reached in 6 hours 28 minutes. Fournier first, De Knyff\r\nsecond by six minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Liquid Air Co._\r\n\r\n_Diagram of the Liquid Air Motor-Car, showing A, reservoir of liquid\r\nair; B, pipes in which the liquid is transformed into atmospheric air\r\nunder great pressure; C, cylinders for driving the rear wheels by\r\nmeans of chain-gear._]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the racing became furious. Several accidents occurred.\r\nEdge, driving the only English car, wrecked his machine on a culvert,\r\nthe sharp curve of which flung the car into the air and broke its\r\nsprings. Another ruined his chances by running over and killing a boy.\r\nBut Fournier, Antony, De Knyff, and Girardot managed to avoid mishaps\r\nfor that day, and covered the ground at a tremendous pace. At\r\nDüsseldorf Girardot won the lead from Fournier, to lose it again\r\nshortly. Antony, driving at a reckless speed, gained ground all day,\r\nand arrived a close second at Hanover, the halting-place, after a run\r\naveraging, in spite of bad roads and dangerous corners, no less than\r\n54 miles an hour!\r\n\r\nThe _chauffeur_ in such a race must indeed be a man of iron nerves.\r\nThrough the great black goggles which shelter his face from the\r\ndust-laden hurricane set up by the speed he travels at he must keep a\r\nperpetual, piercingly keen watch. Though travelling at express speed,\r\nthere are no signals to help him; he must be his own signalman as well\r\nas driver. He must mark every loose stone on the road, every\r\ninequality, every sudden rise or depression; he must calculate the\r\ncurves at the corners and judge whether his mechanician, hanging out\r\non the inward side, will enable a car to round a turn without\r\nslackening speed. His calculations and decisions must be made in the\r\nfraction of a second, for a moment’s hesitation might be disaster. His\r\ndriving must be furious and not reckless; the timid _chauffeur_ will\r\nnever win, the careless one will probably lose. His head must be cool\r\nalthough the car leaps beneath him like a wild thing, and the wind\r\nlashes his face. At least one well-tried driver found the mere mental\r\nstrain too great to bear, and retired from the contest; and we may be\r\nsure that few of the competitors slept much during the nights of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock on the 29th Fournier started on the third stage, which\r\nwitnessed another bout of fast travelling. It was now a struggle\r\nbetween him and Antony for first place. The pace rose at times to\r\neighty miles an hour, a speed at which our fastest expresses seldom\r\ntravel. Such a speed means huge risks, for stopping, even with the\r\npowerful brakes fitted to the large cars, would be a matter of a\r\nhundred yards or more. Not far from Hanover Antony met with an\r\naccident--Girardot now held second place; and Fournier finished an\r\neasy first. All along the route crowds had cheered him, and hurled\r\nbouquets into the car, and wished him good speed; but in Berlin the\r\nassembled populace went nearly frantic at his appearance. Fournier was\r\noverwhelmed with flowers, laurel wreaths, and other offerings; dukes,\r\nduchesses, and the great people of the land pressed for presentations;\r\nhe was the hero of the hour.\r\n\r\nThus ended what may be termed a peaceful invasion of Germany by the\r\nFrench. Among other things it had shown that over an immense stretch\r\nof country, over roads in places bad as only German roads can be, the\r\nautomobile was able to maintain an average speed superior to that of\r\nthe express trains running between Paris and Berlin; also that, in\r\nspite of the large number of cars employed in the race, the accidents\r\nto the public were a negligible quantity. It should be mentioned that\r\nthe actual time occupied by Fournier was 16 hours 5 minutes; that out\r\nof the 109 starters 47 reached Berlin; and that Osmont on a motor\r\ncycle finished only 3 hours and 10 minutes behind the winner.\r\n\r\nIn England such racing would be undesirable and impossible, owing to\r\nthe crookedness of our roads. It would certainly not be permissible so\r\nlong as the 12 miles an hour limit is observed. At the present time an\r\nagitation is on foot against this restriction, which, though\r\nreasonable enough among traffic and in towns, appears unjustifiable in\r\nopen country. To help to convince the magisterial mind of the ease\r\nwith which a car can be stopped, and therefore of its safety even at\r\ncomparatively high speeds, trials were held on January 2, 1902, in\r\nWelbeck Park. The results showed that a car travelling at 13 miles an\r\nhour could be stopped dead in 4 yards; at 18 miles in 7 yards; at 20\r\nmiles in 13 yards; or in less than half the distance required to pull\r\nup a horse-vehicle driven at similar speeds.\r\n\r\n_Uses._--Ninety-five per cent of motors, at least in England, are\r\nattached to pleasure vehicles, cycles, voiturettes, and large cars. On\r\naccount of the costliness of cars motorists are far less numerous than\r\ncyclists; but those people whose means enable them to indulge in\r\nautomobilism find it extremely fascinating. Caricaturists have\r\npresented to us in plenty the gloomier incidents of motoring--the\r\nbroken chain, the burst tyre, the “something gone wrong.” It requires\r\npersonal experience to understand how lightly these mishaps weigh\r\nagainst the exhilaration of movement, the rapid change of scene, the\r\nsensation of control over power which can whirl one along tirelessly\r\nat a pace altogether beyond the capacities of horseflesh. If proof\r\nwere wanted of the motor car’s popularity it will be seen in the\r\nunconventional dress of the _chauffeur_. The breeze set up by his\r\nrapid rush is such as would penetrate ordinary clothing; he dons\r\ncumbrous fur cloaks. The dust is all-pervading at times; he swathes\r\nhimself in dust-proof overalls, and mounts large goggles edged with\r\nvelvet, while a cap of semi-nautical cut tightly drawn down over neck\r\nand ears serves to protect those portions of his anatomy. The\r\ngeneral effect is peculiarly unpicturesque; but even the most\r\nartistically-minded driver is ready to sacrifice appearances to\r\ncomfort and the proper enjoyment of his car.\r\n\r\nIn England the great grievance of motorists arises from the speed\r\nlimit imposed by law. To restrict a powerful car to twelve miles an\r\nhour is like confining a thoroughbred to the paces of a broken-down\r\ncab horse. Careless driving is unpardonable, but its occasional\r\nexistence scarcely justifies the intolerant attitude of the law\r\ntowards motorists in general. It must, however, be granted in justice\r\nto the police that the _chauffeur_, from constant transgression of the\r\nlaw, becomes a bad judge of speed, and often travels at a far greater\r\nvelocity than he is willing to admit.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of the motor car for many purposes is immense,\r\nespecially for cross-country journeys, which may be made from door to\r\ndoor without the monotony or indirectness of railway travel. It bears\r\nthe doctor swiftly on his rounds. It carries the business man from his\r\ncountry house to his office. It delivers goods for the merchant;\r\nparcels for the post office.\r\n\r\nIn the warfare of the future, too, it will play its part, whether to\r\ndrag heavy ordnance and stores, or to move commanding officers from\r\npoint to point, or perform errands of mercy among the wounded. By the\r\ncourtesy of the Locomobile Company we are permitted to append the\r\ntestimony of Captain R. S. Walker, R.E., to the usefulness of a car\r\nduring the great Boer War.\r\n\r\n“Several months ago I noticed a locomobile car at Cape Town, and being\r\nstruck with its simplicity and neatness, bought it and took it up\r\ncountry with me, with a view to making some tests with it over bad\r\nroads, &c. Its first trip was over a rough course round Pretoria,\r\nespecially chosen to find out defects before taking it into regular\r\nuse. Naturally, as the machine was not designed for this class of\r\nwork, there were several. In about a month these had all been found\r\nout and remedied, and the car was in constant use, taking stores, &c.,\r\nround the towns and forts. It also performed some very useful work in\r\nvisiting out-stations, where searchlights were either installed or\r\nwanted, and in this way visited nearly all the bigger towns in the\r\nTransvaal. It was possible to go round all the likely positions for a\r\nsearchlight in one day at every station, which frequently meant\r\nconsiderably over fifty miles of most indifferent roads--more than a\r\nsingle horse could have been expected to do--and the car generally\r\ncarried two persons on these occasions. The car was also used as a\r\ntender to a searchlight plant, on a gun-carriage and limber, being\r\nutilised to fetch gasolene, carbons, water, &c., &c., and also to run\r\nthe dynamo for charging the accumulators used for sparking, thus\r\nsaving running the gasolene motor for this purpose. To do this the\r\ntrail of the carriage, on which was the dynamo, was lowered on to the\r\nground, the back of the car was pulled up, one wheel being supported\r\non the dynamo pulley and the other clear of the ground, and two bolts\r\nwere passed through the balance-gear to join it. On one occasion the\r\ncar ran a 30 c.m. searchlight for an hour, driving a dynamo in this\r\nway. In consequence of this a trailer has been made to carry a dynamo\r\nand projector for searchlighting in the field, but so far this has\r\nnot been so used. The trailer hooks into an eye, passing just behind\r\nthe balance-gear. A Maxim, Colt, or small ammunition cart, &c., could\r\nbe attached to this same eye.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly the best piece of work done by the car so far was its\r\ntrial trip with the trailer, when it blew up the mines at Klein Nek.\r\nThese mines were laid some eight months previously, and had never been\r\nlooked to in the interval. There had been several bad storms, the\r\nBoers and cattle had been frequently through the Nek, it had been on\r\nfire, and finally it was shelled with lyddite. The mines, eighteen in\r\nnumber, were found to be intact except two, which presumably had been\r\nfired off by the heat of the veldt fire. All the insulation was burnt\r\noff the wires, and the battery was useless. It had been anticipated\r\nthat a dynamo exploder would be inadequate to fire these mines, so a\r\n250 volt two h.p. motor, which happened to be in Pretoria, weighing\r\nabout three or four hundredweight, was placed on the trailer; a\r\nquarter of a mile of insulated cable, some testing gear, the kits of\r\nthree men and their rations for three days, with a case of gasolene\r\nfor the car, were also carried on the car and trailer, and the whole\r\nleft Pretoria one morning and trekked to Rietfontein. Two of us were\r\nmounted, the third drove the car. At Rietfontein we halted for the\r\nnight, and started next morning with an escort through Commando Nek,\r\nround the north of the Magaliesburg, to near Klein Nek, where the road\r\nhad to be left, and the car taken across country through bush veldt.\r\nAt the bottom the going was pretty easy; only a few bushes had to be\r\ncharged down, and the grass, &c., rather wound itself around the\r\nwheels and chain. As the rise became steeper the stones became very\r\nlarge, and the car had to be taken along very gingerly to prevent\r\nbreaking the wheels. A halt was made about a quarter of a mile from\r\nthe top of the Nek, where the mines were. These were reconnoitered,\r\nand the wire, &c., was picked up; that portion which was useless was\r\nplaced on top of the charges, and the remainder taken to the car. The\r\ndynamo was slid off the trailer, the car backed against it; one wheel\r\nwas raised slightly and placed against the dynamo pulley, which was\r\nheld up to it by a man using his rifle as a lever; the other wheel was\r\non the ground with a stone under it. The balance gear being free, the\r\ndynamo was excited without the other wheel moving, and the load being\r\non for a very short time (that is, from the time of touching lead on\r\ndynamo terminal to firing of the mine) no harm could come to the car.\r\nWhen all the leads had been joined to the dynamo the car was started,\r\nand after a short time, when it was judged to have excited, the second\r\nterminal was touched, a bang and clouds of dust resulted, and the\r\nKlein Nek Minefield had ceased to exist. The day was extremely hot,\r\nand the work had not been light, so the tea, made with water drawn\r\ndirect from the boiler, which we were able to serve round to the main\r\nbody of our escort was much appreciated, and washed down the surplus\r\nrations we dispensed with to accommodate the battery and wire, which\r\nwe could not leave behind for the enemy.\r\n\r\n“On the return journey we found this extra load too much for the car,\r\nand had great difficulty getting up to Commando Nek, frequently having\r\nto stop to get up steam, so these materials were left at the first\r\nblockhouse, and the journey home continued in comfort.\r\n\r\n“A second night at Rietfontein gave us a rest after our labour, and\r\nthe third afternoon saw us on our way back to Pretoria. As luck would\r\nhave it, a sandstorm overtook the car, which had a lively time of it.\r\nThe storm began by blowing the sole occupant’s hat off, so, the two\r\nmounted men being a long way behind, he shut off steam and chased his\r\nhat. In the meantime the wind increased, and the car sailed off ‘on\r\nits own,’ and was only just caught in time to save a smash. Luckily\r\nthe gale was in the right direction, for the fire was blown out, and\r\nit was impossible to light a match in the open. The car sailed into a\r\npoort on the outskirts of Pretoria, got a tow from a friendly cart\r\nthrough it, and then steamed home after the fire had been relit.\r\n\r\n“The load carried on this occasion (without the battery, &c.) must\r\nhave been at least five hundredweight besides the driver, which,\r\nconsidering the car is designed to carry two on ordinary roads, and\r\nthat these roads were by no means ordinary, was no mean feat. The car,\r\nas ordinarily equipped for trekking, carries the following: Blankets,\r\nwaterproof sheets, &c., for two men; four planks for crossing ditches,\r\nbogs, stones, &c.; all necessary tools and spare parts, a day’s supply\r\nof gasolene, a couple of telephones, and one mile of wire. In\r\naddition, on the trailer, if used for searchlighting: One 30 c.m.\r\nprojector, one automatic lamp for projector, one dynamo (100 volts 20\r\nampères), two short lengths of wire, two pairs of carbons, tools, &c.\r\nThis trailer would normally be carried with the baggage, and only\r\npicked up by the car when wanted as a light; that is, as a rule, after\r\narriving in camp, when a good many other things could be left behind.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most useful work in store for the motor is to help relieve\r\nthe congestion of our large towns and to restore to the country some\r\nof its lost prosperity. There is no stronger inducement to make people\r\nlive in the country than rapid and safe means of locomotion, whether\r\npublic or private. At present the slow and congested suburban train\r\nservices on some sides of London consume as much time as would suffice\r\na motor car to cover twice or three times the distance. We must\r\nwelcome any form of travel which will tend to restore the balance\r\nbetween country and town by enabling the worker to live far from his\r\nwork. The gain to the health of the nation arising from more even\r\ndistribution of population would be inestimable.\r\n\r\nA world’s tour is among the latest projects in automobilism. On April\r\n29, 1902, Dr. Lehwess and nine friends started from Hyde Park Corner\r\nfor a nine months’ tour on three vehicles, the largest of them a\r\nluxuriously appointed 24 horse-power caravan, built to accommodate\r\nfour persons. Their route lies through France, Germany, Russia,\r\nSiberia, China, Japan, and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-SPEED RAILWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA century ago a long journey was considered an exploit, and an exploit\r\nto be carried through as quickly as possible on account of the dangers\r\nof the road and the generally uncomfortable conditions of travel.\r\nTo-day, though our express speed is many times greater than that of\r\nthe lumbering coaches, our carriages comparatively luxurious, the risk\r\npractically nil, the same wish lurks in the breast of ninety-nine out\r\nof a hundred railway passengers--to spend the shortest time in the\r\ntrain that the time-table permits of. Time differences that to our\r\ngrandfathers would have appeared trifling are now matters of\r\nsufficient importance to make rival railway companies anxious to clip\r\na few minutes off a 100-mile “run” simply because their passengers\r\nappreciate a few minutes’ less confinement to the cars.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifty years the highest express speeds have not\r\nmaterially altered. The Great Western Company in its early days ran\r\ntrains from Paddington to Slough, 18 miles, in 15-1/2 minutes, or at\r\nan average pace of 69-1/2 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the present regular express services of the world we\r\nfind America heading the list with a 50-mile run between Atlantic City\r\nand Camden, covered at the average speed of 68 miles an hour; Britain\r\nsecond with a 33-mile run between Forfar and Perth at 59 miles; and\r\nFrance a good third with an hourly average of rather more than 58\r\nmiles between Les Aubrais and S. Pierre des Corps. These runs are\r\nlonger than that on the Great Western Railway referred to above (which\r\nnow occupies twenty-four minutes), but their average velocity is less.\r\nWhat is the cause of this decrease of speed? Not want of power in\r\nmodern engines; at times our trains attain a rate of 80 miles an hour,\r\nand in America a mile has been turned off in the astonishing time of\r\nthirty-two seconds. We should rather seek it in the need for economy\r\nand in the physical limitations imposed by the present system of\r\nplate-laying and railroad engineering. An average speed of ninety\r\nmiles an hour would, as things now stand, be too wasteful of coal and\r\ntoo injurious to the rolling-stock to yield profit to the proprietors\r\nof a line; and, except in certain districts, would prove perilous for\r\nthe passengers. Before our services can be much improved the steam\r\nlocomotive must be supplanted by some other application of motive\r\npower, and the metals be laid in a manner which will make special\r\nprovision for extreme speed.\r\n\r\nSince rapid transit is as much a matter of commercial importance as of\r\nmere personal convenience it must not be supposed that an average of\r\n50 miles an hour will continue to meet the needs of travellers.\r\nAlready practical experiments have been made with two systems that\r\npromise us an ordinary speed of 100 miles an hour and an express speed\r\nconsiderably higher.\r\n\r\nOne of these, the monorail or single-rail system, will be employed on\r\na railroad projected between Manchester and Liverpool. At present\r\npassengers between these two cities--the first to be connected by a\r\nrailroad of any kind--enjoy the choice of three rival services\r\ncovering 34-1/2 miles in three-quarters of an hour. An eminent\r\nengineer, Mr. F. B. Behr, now wishes to add a fourth of unprecedented\r\nswiftness. Parliamentary powers have been secured for a line starting\r\nfrom Deansgate, Manchester, and terminating behind the pro-Cathedral\r\nin Liverpool, on which single cars will run every ten minutes at a\r\nvelocity of 110 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nA monorail track presents a rather curious appearance. The ordinary\r\nparallel metals are replaced by a single rail carried on the summit of\r\nA-shaped trestles, the legs of which are firmly bolted to sleepers. A\r\nmonorail car is divided lengthwise by a gap that allows it to hang\r\nhalf on either side of the trestles and clear them as it moves. The\r\ndouble flanged wheels to carry and drive the car are placed at the\r\napex of the gap. As the “centre of gravity” is below the rail the car\r\ncannot turn over, even when travelling round a sharp curve.\r\n\r\nThe first railway built on this system was constructed by M. Charles\r\nLartigue, a French engineer, in Algeria, a district where an ordinary\r\ntwo-rail track is often blocked by severe sand-storms. He derived the\r\nidea of balancing trucks over an elevated rail from caravans of camels\r\nladen on each flank with large bags. The camel, or rather its legs,\r\nwas transformed by the engineer’s eye into iron trestles, while its\r\nburden became a car. A line built as a result of this observation, and\r\nsupplied with mules as tractive power, has for many years played an\r\nimportant part in the esparto-grass trade of Algeria.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Mr. Behr decided that by applying steam to M. Lartigue’s\r\nsystem he could make it successful as a means of transporting\r\npassengers and goods. He accordingly set up in Tothill Fields,\r\nWestminster, on the site of the new Roman Catholic Cathedral, a\r\nminiature railway which during nine months of use showed that the\r\nmonorail would be practical for heavy traffic, safe, and more cheaply\r\nmaintained than the ordinary double-metal railway. The train travelled\r\neasily round very sharp curves and climbed unusually steep gradients\r\nwithout slipping.\r\n\r\nMr. Behr was encouraged to construct a monorail in Kerry, between\r\nListowel, a country town famous for its butter, and Ballybunion, a\r\nseaside resort of increasing popularity. The line, opened on the 28th\r\nof February 1888, has worked most satisfactorily ever since, without\r\ninjury to a single employé or passenger.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the trestles, two feet below the apex, run two\r\nguide-rails, against which press small wheels attached to the\r\ncarriages to prevent undue oscillation and “tipping” round curves. At\r\nthe three stations there are, instead of points, turn-tables or\r\nswitches on to which the train runs for transference to sidings.\r\n\r\nRoad traffic crosses the rail on drawbridges, which are very easily\r\nworked, and which automatically set signals against the train. The\r\nbridges are in two portions and act on the principle of the Tower\r\nBridge, each half falling from a perpendicular position towards the\r\ncentre, where the ends rest on the rail, specially strengthened at\r\nthat spot to carry the extra weight. The locomotive is a twin affair;\r\nhas two boilers, two funnels, two fireboxes; can draw 240 tons on the\r\nlevel at fifteen miles an hour, and when running light travels a mile\r\nin two minutes. The carriages, 18 feet long and carrying twelve\r\npassengers on each side, are divided longitudinally into two parts.\r\nTrucks too are used, mainly for the transport of sand--of which each\r\ncarries three tons--from Ballybunion to Listowel: and in the centre of\r\neach train is a queer-looking vehicle serving as a bridge for any one\r\nwho may wish to cross from one side of the rail to the other.\r\n\r\nSeveral lines on the pattern of the Ballybunion-Listowel have been\r\nerected in different countries. Mr. Behr was not satisfied with his\r\nfirst success, however, and determined to develop the monorail in the\r\ndirection of fast travelling, which he thought would be most easily\r\nattained on a trestle-track. In 1893 he startled engineers by\r\nproposing a Lightning-Express service, to transport passengers at a\r\nvelocity of 120 miles an hour. But the project seemed too ideal to\r\ntempt money from the pockets of financiers, and Mr. Behr soon saw that\r\nif a high-speed railway after his own heart were constructed it must\r\nbe at his own expense. He had sufficient faith in his scheme to spend\r\n£40,000 on an experimental track at the Brussels Exhibition of 1897.\r\nThe exhibition was in two parts, connected by an electric railway, the\r\none at the capital, the other at Tervueren, seven miles away. Mr. Behr\r\nbuilt his line at Tervueren.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty he encountered in its construction arose from\r\nthe opposition of landowners, mostly small peasant proprietors, who\r\nwere anxious to make advantageous terms before they would hear of the\r\nrail passing through their lands. Until he had concluded two hundred\r\nseparate contracts, by most of which the peasants benefited, his\r\nplatelayers could not get to work. Apart from this opposition the\r\nconditions were not favourable. He was obliged to bridge no less than\r\nten roads; and the contour of the country necessitated steep\r\ngradients, sharp curves, long cuttings and embankments, the last of\r\nwhich, owing to a wet summer, could not be trusted to stand quite\r\nfirm. The track was doubled for three miles, passing at each end round\r\na curve of 1600 feet radius.\r\n\r\nThe rail ran about four feet above the track on trestles bolted down\r\nto steel sleepers resting on ordinary ballast. The carriage--Mr. Behr\r\nused but one on this line--weighed 68 tons, was 59 feet long and 11\r\nfeet wide, and could accommodate one hundred persons. It was\r\nhandsomely fitted up, and had specially-shaped seats which neutralised\r\nthe effect of rounding curves, and ended fore and aft in a point, to\r\novercome the wind-resistance in front and the air-suction behind.\r\nSixteen pairs of wheels on the under side of the carriage engaged with\r\nthe two pairs of guide rails flanking the trestles, and eight large\r\ndouble-flanged wheels, 4-1/2 feet in diameter, carried the weight of\r\nthe vehicle. The inner four of these wheels were driven by as many\r\npowerful electric motors contained, along with the guiding mechanism,\r\nin the lower part of the car. The motors picked up current from the\r\ncentre rail and from another steel rail laid along the sleepers on\r\nporcelain insulators.\r\n\r\nThe top speed attained was about ninety miles an hour. On the close of\r\nthe Exhibition special experiments were made at the request of the\r\nBelgian, French, and Russian Governments, with results that proved\r\nthat the Behr system deserved a trial on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nThe engineer accordingly approached the British Government with a Bill\r\nfor the construction of a high-speed line between Liverpool and\r\nManchester. A Committee of the House of Commons rejected the Bill on\r\nrepresentations of the Salford Corporation. The Committee had to\r\nadmit, nevertheless, that the evidence called was mainly in favour of\r\nthe system; and, the plans of the rail having been altered to meet\r\ncertain objections, Parliamentary consent was obtained to commence\r\noperations when the necessary capital had been subscribed. In a few\r\nyears the great seaport and the great cotton town will probably be\r\nwithin a few minutes’ run of each other.\r\n\r\nA question that naturally arises in the mind of the reader is this:\r\ncould the cars, when travelling at 110 miles an hour, be arrested\r\nquickly enough to avoid an accident if anything got on the line?\r\n\r\nThe Westinghouse air-brake has a retarding force of three miles a\r\nsecond. It would therefore arrest a train travelling at 110 miles per\r\nhour in 37 seconds, or 995 yards. Mr. Behr proposes to reinforce the\r\nWestinghouse with an electric brake, composed of magnets 18 inches\r\nlong, exerting on the guide rails by means of current generated by the\r\nreversed motors an attractive force of 200 lbs. per square inch. One\r\ngreat advantage of this brake is that its efficiency is greatest when\r\nthe speed of the train is highest and when it is most needed. The\r\nunited brakes are expected to stop the car in half the distance of the\r\nWestinghouse alone; but they would not both be applied except in\r\nemergencies. Under ordinary conditions the slowing of a car would take\r\nplace only at the termini, where the line ascends gradients into the\r\nstations. There would, however, be small chance of collisions, the\r\nrailway being securely fenced off throughout its entire length, and\r\nfree from level crossings, drawbridges and points. Furthermore, each\r\ntrain would be its own signalman. Suppose the total 34-1/2 miles\r\ndivided into “block” lengths of 7 miles. On leaving a terminus the\r\ntrain sets a danger signal behind it; at 7 miles it sets another, and\r\nat 14 miles releases the first signal. So that the driver of a car\r\nwould have at least 7 miles to slow down in after seeing the signals\r\nagainst him. In case of fog he would consult a miniature signal in his\r\ncabin working electrically in unison with the large semaphores.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester-Liverpool rail will be reserved for express traffic\r\nonly. Mr. Behr does not believe in mixing speeds, and considers it one\r\nof the advantages of his system that slow cars and waggons of the\r\nordinary two-rail type cannot be run on the monorail; because if they\r\ncould managers might be tempted to place them there.\r\n\r\nA train will consist of a single vehicle for forty, fifty, or seventy\r\npassengers, as the occasion requires. It is calculated that an average\r\nof twelve passengers at one penny per mile would pay all the expenses\r\nof running a car.\r\n\r\nMr. Behr maintains that monorails can be constructed far more cheaply\r\nthan the two-rail, because they permit sharper curves, and thereby\r\nsave a lot of cutting and embankment; and also because the monorail\r\nitself, when trestles and rail are specially strengthened, can serve\r\nas its own bridge across roads, valleys and rivers.\r\n\r\nThough the single-rail has come to the front of late, it must not be\r\nsupposed that the two-rail track is for ever doomed to moderate speeds\r\nonly. German engineers have built an electric two-rail military line\r\nbetween Berlin and Zossen, seventeen miles long, over which cars have\r\nbeen run at a hundred miles an hour. The line has very gradual curves,\r\nand in this respect is inferior to the more sinuous monorail. Its\r\nchief virtue is the method of applying motive power--a method common\r\nto both systems.\r\n\r\nThe steam locomotive creates its own motive force, and as long as it\r\nhas fuel and water can act independently. The electric locomotive, on\r\nthe other hand, receives its power through metallic conductors from\r\nsome central station. Should the current fail all the traffic on the\r\nline is suspended. So far the advantage rests with the steamer. But\r\nas regards economy the superiority of the current is obvious. In\r\nthe electric systems under consideration--the monorail and\r\nBerlin-Zossen--there is less weight per passenger to be shifted, since\r\na comparatively light motor supersedes the heavy locomotive. The cars\r\nrunning singly, bridges and track are subjected to less strain, and\r\ncost less to keep in repair. But the greatest saving of all is made in\r\nfuel. A steam locomotive uses coal wastefully, sending a lot of latent\r\npower up the funnel in the shape of half-expanded steam. Want of space\r\nprevents the designer from fitting to a moving engine the more\r\neconomical machinery to be found in the central power-station of an\r\nelectric railway, which may be so situated--by the water-side or near\r\na pit’s mouth--that fuel can be brought to it at a trifling cost. Not\r\nonly is the expense of distributing coal over the system avoided, but\r\nthe coal itself, by the help of triple and quadruple expansion engines\r\nshould yield two or three times as much energy per ton as is developed\r\nin a locomotive furnace.\r\n\r\nMany schemes are afoot for the construction of high-speed railways.\r\nThe South-Eastern plans a monorail between Cannon Street and Charing\r\nCross to avoid the delay that at present occurs in passing from one\r\nstation to the other. We hear also of a projected railway from London\r\nto Brighton, which will reduce the journey to half-an-hour; and of\r\nanother to connect Dover and London. It has even been suggested to\r\nestablish monorails on existing tracks for fast passenger traffic, the\r\nexpresses passing overhead, the slow and goods trains plodding along\r\nthe double metals below.\r\n\r\nBut the most ambitious programme of all comes from the land of the\r\nCzar. M. Hippolyte Romanoff, a Russian engineer, proposes to unite St.\r\nPetersburg and Moscow by a line that shall cover the intervening 600\r\nmiles in three hours--an improvement of ten hours on the present\r\ntime-tables. He will use T-shaped supports to carry two rails, one on\r\neach arm, from which the cars are to hang. The line being thus double\r\nwill permit the cars--some four hundred in number--to run to and fro\r\ncontinuously, urged on their way by current picked up from overhead\r\nwires. Each car is to have twelve wheels, four drivers arranged\r\nvertically and eight horizontally, to prevent derailment by gripping\r\nthe rail on either side. The stoppage or breakdown of any car will\r\nautomatically stop those following by cutting off the current.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of railway history lines were projected in all\r\ndirections, regardless of the fact whether they would be of any use or\r\nnot. Many of these lines began, where they ended, on paper. And now\r\nthat the high-speed question has cropped up, we must not believe that\r\nevery projected electric railway will be built, though of the ultimate\r\nprevalence of far higher speeds than we now enjoy there can be no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe following is a time-table drawn up on the two-mile-per-minute\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nA man leaving London at 10 A.M. would reach--\r\n\r\n    Brighton      50 miles away, at 10.25 A.M.\r\n    Portsmouth    60   \"      \"     10.30 A.M.\r\n    Birmingham   113   \"      \"     10.57 A.M.\r\n    Leeds        188   \"      \"     11.34 A.M.\r\n    Liverpool    202   \"      \"     11.41 A.M.\r\n    Holyhead     262   \"      \"     12.11 P.M.\r\n    Edinburgh    400   \"      \"      1.20 P.M.\r\n    Aberdeen     540   \"      \"      2.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of the records established in the “Race to the\r\nNorth” and by American “fliers”?\r\n\r\nAnd what about continental travel?\r\n\r\nAssuming that the Channel Tunnel is built--perhaps a rather large\r\nassumption--Paris will be at our very doors. A commercial traveller\r\nwill step into the lightning express at London, sleep for two hours\r\nand twenty-four minutes and wake, refreshed, to find the blue-smocked\r\nParis porters bawling in his ear. Or even if we prefer to keep the\r\n“little silver streak” free from subterranean burrows, he will be able\r\nto catch the swift turbine steamers--of which more anon--at Dover,\r\nslip across to Calais in half-an-hour, and be at the French capital\r\nwithin four hours of quitting London. And if M. Romanoff’s standard be\r\nreached, the latest thing in hats despatched from Paris at noon may\r\nbe worn in Regent Street before two o’clock.\r\n\r\nSuch speeds would indeed produce a revolution in travelling comparable\r\nto the substitution of the steam locomotive for the stage coach. As\r\nhas been pithily said, the effect of steam was to make the bulk of\r\npopulation travel, whereas they had never travelled before, but the\r\neffect of the electric railway will be to make those who travel travel\r\nmuch further and much oftener.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA EXPRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836 the _Sirius_, a paddle-wheel vessel, crossed the\r\nAtlantic from Cork Harbour to New York in nineteen days. Contrast with\r\nthe first steam-passage from the Old World to the New a return journey\r\nof the _Deutschland_, a North German liner, which in 1900 averaged\r\nover twenty-seven miles an hour between Sandy Hook and Plymouth,\r\naccomplishing the whole distance in the record time of five days seven\r\nhours thirty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\nThis growth of speed is even more remarkable than might appear from\r\nthe mere comparison of figures. A body moving through water is so\r\nretarded by the inertia and friction of the fluid that to quicken its\r\npace a force quite out of proportion to the increase of velocity must\r\nbe exerted. The proportion cannot be reduced to an exact formula, but\r\nunder certain conditions the speed and the power required advance in\r\nthe ratio of their cubes; that is, to double a given rate of progress\r\neight times the driving-power is needed; to treble it, twenty-seven\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of our fast modern vessels is in every way as superior\r\nto that which moved the _Sirius_, as the beautifully-adjusted safety\r\ncycle is to the clumsy “boneshaker” which passed for a wonder among\r\nour grandfathers. A great improvement has also taken place in the art\r\nof building ships on lines calculated to offer least resistance to the\r\nwater, and at the same time afford a good carrying capacity. The big\r\nliner, with its knife-edged bow and tapering hull, is by its shape\r\nalone eloquent of the high speed which has earned it the title\r\nof Ocean Greyhound; and as for the fastest craft of all,\r\ntorpedo-destroyers, their designers seem to have kept in mind Euclid’s\r\ndefinition of a line--length without breadth. But whatever its shape,\r\nboat or ship may not shake itself free of Nature’s laws. Her\r\nrestraining hand lies heavy upon it. A single man paddles his\r\nweight-carrying dinghy along easily at four miles an hour; eight men\r\nin the pink of condition, after arduous training, cannot urge their\r\nlight, slender, racing shell more than twelve miles in the same time.\r\n\r\nTo understand how mail boats and “destroyers” attain, despite the\r\nenormous resistance of water, velocities that would shame many a\r\ntrain-service, we have only to visit the stokeholds and engine-rooms\r\nof our sea expresses and note the many devices of marine engineers by\r\nwhich fuel is converted into speed.\r\n\r\nWe enter the stokehold through air-locks, closing one door before we\r\ncan open the other, and find ourselves among sweating, grimy men,\r\nstripped to the waist. As though life itself depended upon it they\r\nshovel coal into the rapacious maws of furnaces glowing with a\r\ndazzling glare under the “forced-draught” sent down into the hold by\r\nthe fans whirling overhead. The ignited furnace gases on their way to\r\nthe outer air surrender a portion of their heat to the water from\r\nwhich they are separated by a skin of steel. Two kinds of marine\r\nboiler are used--the fire-tube and the water-tube. In fire-tube\r\nboilers the fire passes inside the tubes and the water outside; in\r\nwater-tube boilers the reverse is the case, the crown and sides of the\r\nfurnace being composed of sheaves of small parallel pipes through\r\nwhich water circulates. The latter type, as generating steam very\r\nquickly, and being able to bear very high pressures, is most often\r\nfound in war vessels of all kinds. The quality sought in boiler\r\nconstruction is that the heating surface should be very large in\r\nproportion to the quantity of water to be heated. Special coal,\r\nanthracite or Welsh, is used in the navy on account of its great\r\nheating power and freedom from smoke; experiments have also been made\r\nwith crude petroleum, or liquid fuel, which can be more quickly put on\r\nboard than coal, requires the services of fewer stokers, and may be\r\nstored in odd corners unavailable as coal bunkers.\r\n\r\nFrom the boiler the steam passes to the engine-room, whither we will\r\nfollow it. We are now in a bewildering maze of clanking, whirling\r\nmachinery; our noses offended by the reek of oil, our ears deafened\r\nby the uproar of the moving metal, our eyes wearied by the efforts to\r\nfollow the motions of the cranks and rods.\r\n\r\nOn either side of us is ranged a series of three or perhaps even four\r\ncylinders, of increasing size. The smallest, known as the\r\nhigh-pressure cylinder, receives steam direct from the boiler. It\r\ntakes in through a slide-valve a supply for a stroke; its piston is\r\ndriven from end to end; the piston-rod flies through the cylinder-end\r\nand transmits a rotary motion to a crank by means of a connecting-rod.\r\nThe half-expanded steam is then ejected, not into the air as would\r\nhappen on a locomotive, but into the next cylinder, which has a larger\r\npiston to compensate the reduction of pressure. Number two served, the\r\nsteam does duty a third time in number three, and perhaps yet a fourth\r\ntime before it reaches the condensers, where its sudden conversion\r\ninto water by cold produces a vacuum suction in the last cylinder of\r\nthe series. The secret of a marine engine’s strength and economy lies\r\nthen in its treatment of the steam, which, like clothes in a numerous\r\nfamily, is not thought to have served its purpose till it has been\r\nused over and over again.\r\n\r\nReciprocating (_i.e._ cylinder) engines, though brought to a high\r\npitch of efficiency, have grave disadvantages, the greatest among\r\nwhich is the annoyance caused by their intense vibration to all\r\npersons in the vessel. A revolving body that is not exactly balanced\r\nruns unequally, and transmits a tremor to anything with which it may\r\nbe in contact. Turn a cycle upside down and revolve the driving-wheel\r\nrapidly by means of the pedal. The whole machine soon begins to\r\ntremble violently, and dance up and down on the saddle springs,\r\nbecause one part of the wheel is heavier than the rest, the mere\r\nweight of the air-valve being sufficient to disturb the balance. Now\r\nconsider what happens in the engine-room of high-powered vessels. On\r\ndestroyers the screws make 400 revolutions a minute. That is to say,\r\nall the momentum of the pistons, cranks, rods, and valves (weighing\r\ntons), has to be arrested thirteen or fourteen times every second.\r\nHowever well the moving parts may be balanced, the vibration is felt\r\nfrom stem to stern of the vessel. Even on luxuriously-appointed\r\nliners, with engines running at a far slower speed, the throbbing of\r\nthe screw (_i.e._ engines) is only too noticeable and productive of\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nWe shall be told, perhaps, that vibration is a necessary consequence\r\nof speed. This is true enough of all vehicles, such as railway trains,\r\nmotor-cars, cycles, which are shaken by the irregularities of the\r\nunyielding surface over which they run, but does not apply universally\r\nto ships and boats. A sail or oar-propelled craft may be entirely free\r\nfrom vibration, whatever its speed, as the motions arising from water\r\nare usually slow and deliberate. In fact, water in its calmer moods is\r\nan ideal medium to travel on, and the trouble begins only with the\r\nintroduction of steam as motive force.\r\n\r\nBut even steam may be robbed of its power to annoy us. The\r\nsteam-turbine has arrived. It works a screw propeller as smoothly as a\r\ndynamo, and at a speed that no cylinder engine could maintain for a\r\nminute without shaking itself to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe steam-turbine is most closely connected with the name of the Hon.\r\nCharles Parsons, son of Lord Rosse, the famous astronomer. He was the\r\nfirst to show, in his speedy little _Turbinia_, the possibilities of\r\nthe turbine when applied to steam navigation. The results have been\r\nsuch as to attract the attention of the whole shipbuilding world.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the turbine is seen in the ordinary windmill. To an\r\naxle revolving in a stationary bearing are attached vanes which oppose\r\na current of air, water, or steam, at an angle to its course, and by\r\nit are moved sideways through a circular path. Mr. Parsons’ turbine\r\nhas of course been specially adapted for the action of steam. It\r\nconsists of a cylindrical, air-tight chest, inside which rotates a\r\ndrum, fitted round its circumference with rows of curved vanes. The\r\nchest itself has fixed immovably to its inner side a corresponding\r\nnumber of vane rings, alternating with those on the drum, and so\r\narranged as to deflect the steam on to the latter at the most\r\nefficient angle. The diameter of the chest and drum is not constant,\r\nbut increases towards the exhaust end, in order to give the expanding\r\nand weakening steam a larger leverage as it proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe steam entering the chest from the boiler at a pressure of some\r\nhundreds of pounds to the square inch strikes the first set of vanes\r\non the drum, passes them and meets the first set of chest-vanes, is\r\nturned from its course on to the second set of drum-vanes, and so on\r\nto the other end of the chest. Its power arises entirely from its\r\nexpansive velocity, which, rather than turn a number of sharp corners,\r\nwill, if possible, compel the obstruction to move out of its way. If\r\nthat obstruction be from any cause difficult to stir, the steam must\r\npass round it until its pressure overcomes the inertia. Consequently\r\nthe turbine differs from the cylinder engine in this respect, that\r\nsteam _can_ pass through and be wasted without doing any work at all,\r\nwhereas, unless the gear of a cylinder moves, and power is exerted,\r\nall steam ways are closed, and there is no waste. In practice,\r\ntherefore, it is found that a turbine is most effective when running\r\nat high speed.\r\n\r\nThe first steam-turbines were used to drive dynamos. In 1884 Mr.\r\nParsons made a turbine in which fifteen wheels of increasing size\r\nmoved at the astonishing rate of 300 revolutions per second, and\r\ndeveloped 10 horse-power. In 1888 followed a 120 horse-power turbine,\r\nand in 1892 one of 2000 horse-power, provided with a condenser to\r\nproduce suction. So successful were these steam fans for electrical\r\nwork, pumping water and ventilating mines, that Mr. Parsons determined\r\nto test them as a means of propelling ships. A small vessel 100 feet\r\nlong and 9 feet in beam was fitted with three turbines--high, medium,\r\nand low pressure, of a total 2000 horse-power--a proportion of motive\r\nforce to tonnage hitherto not approached. Yet when tried over the test\r\ncourse the _Turbinia_, as the boat was fitly named, ran in a most\r\ndisappointing fashion. The screws revolved _too fast_, producing what\r\nis known as _cavitation_, or the scooping out of the water by the\r\nscrews, so that they moved in a partial vacuum and utilised only a\r\nfraction of their force, from lack of anything to “bite” on. This\r\ndefect was remedied by employing screws of coarser pitch and larger\r\nblade area, three of which were attached to each of the three\r\npropeller shafts. On a second trial the _Turbinia_ attained 32-3/4\r\nknots over the “measured mile,” and later the astonishing speed of\r\nforty miles an hour, or double that of the fast Channel packets. At\r\nthe Spithead Review in 1897 one of the most interesting sights was the\r\nlittle nimble _Turbinia_ rushing up and down the rows of majestic\r\nwarships at the rate of an express train.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.M.S. Torpedo Destroyer “Viper.” This vessel was the\r\nfastest afloat, attaining the enormous speed of 41 miles an hour. The\r\nscrews were worked by turbines, giving 11,000 horse-power. She was\r\nwrecked on Alderney during the Naval Manoeuvres of 1901._]\r\n\r\nAfter this success Mr. Parsons erected works at Wallsend-on-Tyne for\r\nthe special manufacture of turbines. The Admiralty soon placed with\r\nhim an order for a torpedo-destroyer--the _Viper_--of 350 tons; which\r\non its trial trip exceeded forty-one miles an hour at an estimated\r\nhorse-power (11,000) equalling that of our largest battleships. A\r\nsister vessel, the _Cobra_, of like size, proved as speedy.\r\nMisfortune, however, overtook both destroyers. The _Viper_ was wrecked\r\nAugust 3, 1901, on the coast of Alderney during the autumn naval\r\nmanoeuvres, and the _Cobra_ foundered in a severe storm on September\r\n12 of the same year in the North Sea. This double disaster casts no\r\nreflections on the turbine engines; being attributed to fog in the one\r\ncase and to structural weakness in the other. The Admiralty has since\r\nordered another turbine destroyer, and before many years are past we\r\nshall probably see all the great naval powers providing themselves\r\nwith like craft to act as the “eyes of the fleet,” and travel at even\r\nhigher speeds than those of the _Viper_ and _Cobra_.\r\n\r\nThe turbine has been applied to mercantile as well as warlike\r\npurposes. There is at the present time a turbine-propelled steamer,\r\nthe _King Edward_, running in the Clyde on the Fairlie-Campbelltown\r\nroute. This vessel, 250 feet long, 30 broad, 18 deep, contains three\r\nturbines. In each the steam is expanded fivefold, so that by the time\r\nit passes into the condensers it occupies 125 times its boiler volume.\r\n(On the _Viper_ the steam entered the turbine through an inlet eight\r\ninches in diameter, and left them by an outlet four feet square.) In\r\ncylinder engines thirty-fold expansion is considered a high ratio;\r\nhence the turbine extracts a great deal more power in proportion from\r\nits steam. As a turbine cannot be reversed, special turbines are\r\nattached to the two outside of the three propeller shafts to drive the\r\nvessel astern. The steamer attained 20-1/2 knots over the “Skelmorlie\r\nmile” in fair and calm weather, with 3500 horse-power produced at the\r\nturbines. The _King Edward_ is thus the fastest by two or three knots\r\nof all the Clyde steamers, as she is the most comfortable. We are\r\nassured that as far as the turbines are concerned it is impossible by\r\nplacing the hand upon the steam-chest to tell whether the drum inside\r\nis revolving or not!\r\n\r\nEvery marine engine is judged by its economy in the consumption of\r\ncoal. Except in times of national peril extra speed produced by an\r\nextravagant use of fuel would be severely avoided by all owners and\r\ncaptains of ships. At low speeds the turbine develops less power than\r\ncylinders from the same amount of steam, but when working at high\r\nvelocity it gives at least equal results. A careful record kept by the\r\nmanagers of the Caledonian Steamship Company compares the _King\r\nEdward_ with the _Duchess of Hamilton_, a paddle steamer of equal\r\ntonnage used on the same route and built by the same firm. The record\r\nshows that though the paddle-boat ran a fraction of a mile further\r\nfor every ton of coal burnt in the furnaces, the _King Edward_\r\naveraged two knots an hour faster, a superiority of speed quite out of\r\nproportion to the slight excess of fuel. Were the _Duchess_ driven at\r\n18-1/2 knots instead of 16-1/2 her coal bill would far exceed that of\r\nthe turbine.\r\n\r\nAs an outcome of these first trials the Caledonian Company are\r\nlaunching a second turbine vessel. Three high-speed turbine yachts are\r\nalso on the stocks; one of 700 tons, another of 1500 tons, and a third\r\nof 170 tons. The last, the property of Colonel M’Calmont, is designed\r\nfor a speed of twenty-four knots.\r\n\r\nMr. Parsons claims for his system the following advantages: Greatly\r\nincreased speed; increased carrying power of coal; economy in coal\r\nconsumption; increased facilities for navigating shallow waters;\r\ngreater stability of vessels; reduced weight of machinery (the\r\nturbines of the _King Edward_ weigh but one-half of cylinders required\r\nto give the same power); cheapness of attending the machinery; absence\r\nof vibration, lessening wear and tear of the ship’s hull and assisting\r\nthe accurate training of guns; lowered centre of gravity in the\r\nvessel, and consequent greater safety during times of war.\r\n\r\nThe inventor has suggested a cruiser of 2800 tons, engined up to\r\n80,000 horse-power, to yield a speed of forty-four knots (about fifty\r\nmiles) an hour. Figures such as these suggest that we may be on the\r\neve of a revolution of ocean travel comparable to that made by the\r\nsubstitution of steam for wind power. Whether the steam-turbine will\r\nmake for increased speed all round, or for greater economy, remains to\r\nbe seen; but we may be assured of a higher degree of comfort. We can\r\neasily believe that improvements will follow in this as in other\r\nmechanical contrivances, and that the turbine’s efficiency has not yet\r\nreached a maximum; and even if our ocean expresses, naval and\r\nmercantile, do not attain the one-mile-a-minute standard, which is\r\nstill regarded as creditable to the fastest methods of land\r\nlocomotion, we look forward to a time in the near future when much\r\nhigher speeds will prevail, and the tedium of long voyages be greatly\r\nshortened. Already there is talk of a service which shall reduce the\r\ntrans-Atlantic journey to three-and-a-half days. The means are at hand\r\nto make it a fact.\r\n\r\n     _Note._--In the recently-launched turbine destroyer _Velox_ a\r\n     novel feature is the introduction of ordinary reciprocating\r\n     engines fitted in conjunction with the steam turbines. These\r\n     engines are of triple-compound type, and are coupled direct to\r\n     the main turbines. They take steam from the boilers direct and\r\n     exhaust into the high-pressure turbine. These reciprocating\r\n     engines are for use at cruising speeds. When higher power is\r\n     needed the steam will be admitted to the turbines direct from\r\n     the boilers, and the cylinders be thrown out of gear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL FLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew, if any, problems have so strongly influenced the imagination and\r\nexercised the ingenuity of mankind as that of aërial navigation. There\r\nis something in our nature that rebels against being condemned to the\r\ncondition of “featherless bipeds” when birds, bats, and even minute\r\ninsects have the whole realm of air and the wide heavens open to them.\r\nWho has not, like Solomon, pondered upon “the way of a bird in the\r\nair” with feelings of envy and regret that he is chained to earth by\r\nhis gross body; contrasting our laboured movements from point to point\r\nof the earth’s surface with the easy gliding of the feathered\r\ntraveller? The unrealised wish has found expression in legends of\r\nDædalus, Pegasus, in the “flying carpet” of the fairy tale, and in the\r\npages of Jules Verne, in which last the adventurous Robur on his\r\n“Clipper of the Clouds” anticipates the future in a most startling\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAeromobilism--to use its most modern title--is regarded by the crowd\r\nas the mechanical counterpart of the Philosopher’s Stone or the Elixir\r\nof Life; a highly desirable but unattainable thing. At times this\r\nincredulity is transformed by highly-coloured press reports into an\r\nequally unreasonable readiness to believe that the conquest of the air\r\nis completed, followed by a feeling of irritation that facts are not\r\nas they were represented in print.\r\n\r\nThe proper attitude is of course half-way between these extremes.\r\nReflection will show us that money, time, and life itself would not\r\nhave been freely and ungrudgingly given or risked by many\r\nmen--hard-headed, practical men among them--in pursuit of a\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisp, especially in a century when scientific calculation\r\ntends always to calm down any too imaginative scheme. The existing\r\nstate of the aërial problem may be compared to that of a railway truck\r\nwhich an insufficient number of men are trying to move. Ten men may\r\nmake no impression on it, though they are putting out all their\r\nstrength. Yet the arrival of an eleventh may enable them to overcome\r\nthe truck’s inertia and move it at an increasing pace.\r\n\r\nEvery new discovery of the scientific application of power brings us\r\nnearer to the day when the truck will move. We have metals of\r\nwonderful strength in proportion to their weight; pigmy motors\r\ncontaining the force of giants; a huge fund of mechanical experience\r\nto draw upon; in fact, to paraphrase the Jingo song, “We’ve got the\r\nthings, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too”--but we haven’t\r\nas yet got the machine that can mock the bird like the flying express\r\nmocks the strength and speed of horses.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is not far to seek. The difficulties attending the\r\ncreation of a successful flying-machine are immense, some unique, not\r\nbeing found in aquatic and terrestrial locomotion.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the airship, flying-machine, aerostat, or whatever\r\nwe please to call it, must not merely move, but also lift itself.\r\nNeither a ship nor a locomotive is called upon to do this. Its ability\r\nto lift itself must depend upon either the employment of large\r\nballoons or upon sheer power. In the first case the balloon will, by\r\nreason of its size, be unmanageable in a high wind; in the second\r\ncase, a breakdown in the machinery would probably prove fatal.\r\n\r\nEven supposing that our aerostat can lift itself successfully, we\r\nencounter the difficulties connected with steering in a medium\r\ntraversed by ever-shifting currents of air, which demands of the\r\nhelmsman a caution and capacity seldom required on land or water. Add\r\nto these the difficulties of leaving the ground and alighting safely\r\nupon it; and, what is more serious than all, the fact that though\r\nsuccess can be attained only by experiment, experiment is in this case\r\nextremely expensive and risky, any failure often resulting in total\r\nruin of the machine, and sometimes in loss of life. The list of those\r\nwho have perished in the search for the power of flight is a very long\r\none.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of these obstacles determined attempts have been and are\r\nbeing made to conquer the air. Men in a position to judge are\r\nconfident that the day of conquest is not very far distant, and that\r\nthe next generation may be as familiar with aerostats as we with\r\nmotor-cars. Speculation as to the future is, however, here less\r\nprofitable than a consideration of what has been already done in the\r\ndirection of collecting forces for the final victory.\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning, we see that experimenters must be divided\r\ninto two great classes: those who pin their faith to airships lighter\r\nthan air, _e.g._ Santos Dumont, Zeppelin, Roze; and those who have\r\nsmall respect for balloons, and see the ideal air-craft in a _machine_\r\nlifted entirely by means of power and surfaces pressing the air after\r\nthe manner of a kite. Sir Hiram Maxim and Professor S. P. Langley, Mr.\r\nLawrence Hargrave, and Mr. Sydney Hollands are eminent members of the\r\nlatter cult.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we get on the topic of steerable balloons the name of Mr.\r\nSantos Dumont looms large. But before dealing with his exploits we may\r\nnotice the airship of Count Zeppelin, an ingenious and costly\r\nstructure that was tested over Lake Constance in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was built in a large wooden shed, 450 by 78 by 66 feet,\r\nthat floated on the lake on ninety pontoons. The shed alone cost over\r\n£10,000.\r\n\r\nThe balloon itself was nearly 400 feet long, with a cylindrical\r\ndiameter of 39 feet, except at its ends, which were conical, to offer\r\nas little resistance as possible to the air. Externally it afforded\r\nthe appearance of a single-compartment bag, but in reality it was\r\ndivided into seventeen parts, each gas-tight, so that an accident to\r\none part of the fabric should not imperil the whole.\r\n\r\nA framework of aluminium rods and rings gave the bag a partial\r\nrigidity.\r\n\r\nIts capacity was 12,000 cubic yards of hydrogen gas, which, as our\r\nreaders doubtless know, is much lighter though more expensive than\r\nordinary coal-gas; each inflation costing several hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\nUnder the balloon hung two cars of aluminium, the motors and the\r\nscrews; and also a great sliding weight of 600 lbs. for altering the\r\n“tip” of the airship; and rudders to steer its course.\r\n\r\nOn June 30 a great number of scientific men and experts assembled to\r\nwitness the behaviour of a balloon which had cost £20,000. For two\r\ndays wind prevented a start, but on July 2, at 7.30 P.M., the balloon\r\nemerged from its shed, and at eight o’clock commenced its first\r\njourney, with and against a light easterly wind for a distance of\r\nthree and a half miles. A mishap to the steering-gear occurred early\r\nin the trip, and prevented the airship appearing to advantage, but a\r\nlanding was effected easily and safely. In the following October the\r\nCount made a second attempt, returning against a wind blowing at three\r\nyards a second, or rather more than six miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The air-ship of M. Santos-Dumont rounding the Eiffel\r\nTower during its successful run for the Henri Deutsch Prize._]\r\n\r\nOwing to lack of funds the fate of the “Great Eastern” has overtaken\r\nthe Zeppelin airship--to be broken up, and the parts sold.\r\n\r\nThe aged Count had demonstrated that a petroleum motor could be used\r\nin the neighbourhood of gas without danger. It was, however, reserved\r\nfor a younger man to give a more decided proof of the steerableness of\r\na balloon.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 M. Henri Deutsch, a member of the French Aero Club, founded a\r\nprize of £4000, to win which a competitor must start from the Aero\r\nClub Park, near the Seine in Paris, sail to and round the Eiffel\r\nTower, and be back at the starting-point within a time-limit of\r\nhalf-an-hour.\r\n\r\nM. Santos Dumont, a wealthy and plucky young Brazilian, had,\r\npreviously to this offer, made several successful journeys in motor\r\nballoons in the neighbourhood of the Eiffel Tower. He therefore\r\ndetermined to make a bid for the prize with a specially constructed\r\nballoon “Santos Dumont V.” The third unsuccessful attempt ended in\r\ndisaster to the airship, which fell on to the houses, but fortunately\r\nwithout injuring its occupant.\r\n\r\nAnother balloon--“Santos Dumont VI.”--was then built. On Saturday,\r\nOctober 19th, M. Dumont reached the Tower in nine minutes and\r\nrecrossed the starting line in 20-1/2 more minutes, thus complying\r\nwith the conditions of the prize with half-a-minute to spare. A\r\ndispute, however, arose as to whether the prize had been actually won,\r\nsome of the committee contending that the balloon should have come to\r\nearth within the half-hour, instead of merely passing overhead; but\r\nfinally the well-merited prize was awarded to the determined young\r\naeronaut.\r\n\r\nThe successful airship was of moderate proportions as compared with\r\nthat of Count Zeppelin. The cigar-shaped bag was 112 feet long and 20\r\nfeet in diameter, holding 715 cubic yards of gas. M. Dumont showed\r\noriginality in furnishing it with a smaller balloon inside, which\r\ncould be pumped full of air so as to counteract any leakage in the\r\nexternal bag and keep it taut. The motor, on which everything\r\ndepended, was a four-cylinder petrol-driven engine, furnished with\r\n“water-jackets” to prevent over-heating. The motor turned a large\r\nscrew--made of silk and stretched over light frames--200 times a\r\nminute, giving a driving force of 175 lbs. Behind, a rudder directed\r\nthe airship, and in front hung down a long rope suspended by one end\r\nthat could be drawn towards the centre of the frame to alter the trim\r\nof the ship. The aeronaut stood in a large wicker basket flanked on\r\neither side by bags of sand ballast. The fact that the motor, once\r\nstopped, could only be restarted by coming to earth again added an\r\nelement of great uncertainty to all his trips; and on one occasion the\r\nmis-firing of one of the cylinders almost brought about a collision\r\nwith the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris M. Dumont went to Monaco at the invitation of the prince of\r\nthat principality, and cruised about over the bay in his balloon. His\r\nfresh scheme was to cross to Corsica, but it was brought to an abrupt\r\nconclusion by a leakage of gas, which precipitated balloon and\r\nballoonist into the sea. Dumont was rescued, and at once set about new\r\nprojects, including a visit to the Crystal Palace, where he would have\r\nmade a series of ascents this summer (1902) but for damage done to the\r\nsilk of the gas-bag by its immersion in salt water and the other\r\nvicissitudes it had passed through. Dumont’s most important\r\nachievement has been, like that of Count Zeppelin, the application of\r\nthe gasolene motor to aeromobilism. In proportion to its size this\r\nform of motor develops a large amount of energy, and its mechanism is\r\ncomparatively simple--a matter of great moment to the aeronaut. He has\r\nalso shown that under favourable conditions a balloon may be steered\r\nagainst a head-wind, though not with the certainty that is desirable\r\nbefore air travel can be pronounced an even moderately simple\r\nundertaking. The fact that many inventors, such as Dr. Barton, M.\r\nRoze, Henri Deutsch, are fitting motors to balloons in the hopes of\r\nsolving the aërial problem shows that the airship has still a strong\r\nhold on the minds of men. But on reviewing the successes of such\r\ncombinations of lifting and driving power it must be confessed, with\r\nall due respect to M. Dumont, that they are somewhat meagre, and do\r\nnot show any great advance.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether these men are not working on wrong lines, and\r\nwhether their utmost endeavours and those of their successors will\r\never produce anything more than a very semi-successful craft. Their\r\nefforts appear foredoomed to failure. As Sir Hiram Maxim has observed,\r\na balloon by its very nature is light and fragile, it is a mere\r\nbubble. If it were possible to construct a motor to develop 100\r\nhorse-power for every pound of its weight, it would still be\r\nimpossible to navigate a balloon against a wind of more than a certain\r\nstrength. The mere energy of the motor would crush the gas-bag against\r\nthe pressure of the wind, deform it, and render it unmanageable.\r\nBalloons therefore must be at the mercy of the wind, and obliged to\r\nsubmit to it under conditions not always in accordance with the wish\r\nof the aeronaut.\r\n\r\nSir Hiram in condemning the airship was ready with a substitute. On\r\nlooking round on the patterns of Nature, he concluded that, inasmuch\r\nas all things that fly are heavier than air, the problem of aërial\r\nnavigation must be solved by a machine whose natural tendency is to\r\nfall to the ground, and which can be sustained only by the exertion of\r\ngreat force. Its very weight would enable it to withstand, at least to\r\na far greater extent than the airship, the varying currents of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe lifting principle must be analogous to that by which a kite is\r\nsuspended. A kite is prevented from rising beyond a certain height by\r\na string, and the pressure of the wind working against it at an angle\r\ntends to lift it, like a soft wedge continuously driven under it. In\r\npractice it makes no difference whether the kite be stationary in a\r\nwind or towed rapidly through a dead calm; the wedge-like action of\r\nthe air remains the same.\r\n\r\nMaxim decided upon constructing what was practically a huge compound\r\nkite driven by very powerful motors.\r\n\r\nBut before setting to work on the machine itself he made some useful\r\nexperiments to determine the necessary size of his kites or\r\naeroplanes, and the force requisite to move them.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly built a “whirling-table,” consisting of a long arm\r\nmounted on a strong pivot at one end, and driven by a 10 horse-power\r\nengine. To the free end, which described a circle of 200 feet in\r\ncircumference, he attached small aeroplanes, and by means of delicate\r\nbalances discovered that at 40 miles an hour the aeroplane would lift\r\n133 lbs. per horse-power, and at 60 miles per hour every square foot\r\nof surface sustained 8 lbs. weight. He, in common with other\r\nexperimenters on the same lines, became aware of the fact that if it\r\ntook a certain strain to suspend a stationary weight in the air, _to\r\nadvance it rapidly as well as to suspend it took a smaller strain_.\r\nNow, as on sea and land, increased speed means a very rapid increase\r\nin the force required, this is a point in favour of the\r\nflying-machine. Professor Langley found that a brass plate weighing a\r\npound, when whirled at great speed, was supported in the air by a\r\npulling pressure of less than one ounce. And, of course, as the speed\r\nincreased the plate became more nearly horizontal, offering less\r\nresistance to the air.\r\n\r\nIt is on this behaviour of the aeroplane that the hopes of Maxim and\r\nothers have been based. The swiftly moving aeroplane, coming\r\nconstantly on to fresh air, the inertia of which had not been\r\ndisturbed, would resemble the skater who can at high speed traverse\r\nice that would not bear him at rest.\r\n\r\nMaxim next turned his attention to the construction of the aeroplanes\r\nand engines. He made a special machine for testing fabrics, to decide\r\nwhich would be most suitable for stretching over strong frames to form\r\nthe planes. The fabric must be light, very strong, and offer small\r\nfrictional resistance to the air. The testing-machine was fitted with\r\na nozzle, through which air was forced at a known pace on to the\r\nsubstance under trial, which met the air current at a certain angle\r\nand by means of indicators showed the strength of its “lift” or\r\ntendency to rise, and that of its “drift” or tendency to move\r\nhorizontally in the direction of the air-current. A piece of tin,\r\nmounted at an angle of one in ten to the air-current, showed a “lift”\r\nof ten times its “drift.” This proportion was made the standard.\r\nExperiments conducted on velvet, plush, silk, cotton and woollen goods\r\nproved that the drift of crape was several times that of its lift, but\r\nthat fine linen had a lift equal to nine times its drift; while a\r\nsample of Spencer’s balloon fabric was as good as tin.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he selected this balloon fabric to stretch over light but\r\nstrong frames. The stretching of the material was no easy matter, as\r\nuneven tension distorted it; but eventually the aeroplanes were\r\ncompleted, tight as drumheads.\r\n\r\nThe large or central plane was 50 feet wide and 40 long; on either\r\nside were auxiliary planes, five pairs; giving a total area of 5400\r\nsquare feet.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine built to give the motive power was perhaps the most\r\ninteresting feature of the whole construction. Maxim employed steam in\r\npreference to any other power as being one with which he was most\r\nfamiliar, and yielding most force in proportion to the weight of the\r\napparatus. He designed and constructed a pair of high-pressure\r\ncompound engines, the high-pressure cylinders 5 inches in diameter,\r\nthe low-pressure 8 inches, and both 1 foot stroke. Steam was supplied\r\nto the high-pressure cylinders at 320 lbs. per square inch from a\r\ntubular boiler heated by a gasolene burner so powerful in its action\r\nas to raise the pressure from 100 to 200 lbs. in a minute. The total\r\nweight of the boiler, burner, and engines developing 350 horse-power\r\nwas 2000 lbs., or about 6 lbs. per horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe two screw-propellers driven by the engine measured 17 feet 11\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe completed flying-machine, weighing 7500 lbs., was mounted on a\r\nrailway-truck of 9-foot gauge, in Baldwyn’s Park, Kent, not far from\r\nthe gun-factories for which Sir Hiram is famous. Outside and parallel\r\nto the 9-foot track was a second track, 35 feet across, with a\r\nreversed rail, so that as soon as the machine should rise from the\r\ninner track long spars furnished with flanged wheels at their\r\nextremities should press against the under side of the outer track and\r\nprevent the machine from rising too far. Dynamometers, or instruments\r\nfor measuring strains, were fitted to decide the driving and lifting\r\npower of the screws. Experiments proved that with the engines working\r\nat full power the screw-thrust against the air was 2200 lbs., and the\r\nlifting force of the aeroplanes 10,000 lbs., or 1500 in excess of the\r\nmachine’s weight.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready the machine was fastened to a dynamometer and\r\nsteam run up until it strained at its tether with maximum power; when\r\nthe moorings were suddenly released and it bounded forward at a\r\nterrific pace, so suddenly that some of the crew were flung violently\r\ndown on to the platform. When a speed of 42 miles was reached the\r\ninner wheels left their track, and the outer wheels came into play.\r\nUnfortunately, the long 35-foot axletrees were too weak to bear the\r\nstrain, and one of them broke. The upper track gave way, and for the\r\nfirst time in the history of the world a flying-machine actually left\r\nthe ground fully equipped with engines, boiler, fuel, and a crew. The\r\njourney, however, was a short one, for part of the broken track fouled\r\nthe screws, snapped a propeller blade and necessitated the shutting\r\noff of the steam, which done, the machine settled to earth, the wheels\r\nsinking into the sward and showing by the absence of any marks that it\r\nhad come directly downwards and not run along the surface.\r\n\r\nThe inventor was prevented by other business, and by the want of a\r\nsufficiently large open space, from continuing his experiments, which\r\nhad demonstrated that a large machine heavier than air could be made\r\nto lift itself and move at high speed. Misfortune alone prevented its\r\ntrue capacities being shown.\r\n\r\nAnother experimenter on similar lines, but on a less heroic scale than\r\nSir Hiram Maxim, is Professor S. P. Langley, the secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington. For sixteen years he has devoted\r\nhimself to a persevering course of study of the flying-machine, and\r\nafter oft-repeated failures has scored a decided success in his\r\nAerodrome, which, though only a model, has made considerable flights.\r\nHis researches have proved beyond doubt that the amount of energy\r\nrequired for flight is but one-fiftieth of what was formerly regarded\r\nas a minimum. A French mathematician had proved by figures that a\r\nswallow must develop the power of a horse to maintain its rapid\r\nflight! Professor Langley’s aerodrome has told a very different tale,\r\naffording another instance of the truth of the saying that an ounce of\r\npractice is worth a pound of theory.\r\n\r\nA bird is nearly one thousand times heavier than the air it displaces.\r\nAs a motor it develops huge power for its weight, and consumes a very\r\nlarge amount of fuel in doing so. An observant naturalist has\r\ncalculated that the homely robin devours per diem, in proportion to\r\nits size, what would be to a man a sausage two hundred feet long and\r\nthree inches thick! Any one who has watched birds pulling worms out of\r\nthe garden lawn and swallowing them wholesale can readily credit this.\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley therefore concentrated himself on the production of\r\nan extremely light and at the same time powerful machine. Like Maxim,\r\nhe turned to steam for motive-power, and by rigid economy of weight\r\nconstructed an engine with boilers weighing 5 lbs., cylinders of 26\r\nozs., and an energy of 1 to 1-1/2 horse-power! Surely a masterpiece of\r\nmechanical workmanship! This he enclosed in a boat-shaped cover which\r\nhung from two pairs of aeroplanes 12-1/2 feet from tip to tip. The\r\nwhole apparatus weighed nearly 30 lbs., of which one quarter\r\nrepresented the machinery. Experiments with smaller aerodromes warned\r\nthe Professor that rigidity and balance were the two most difficult\r\nthings to attain; also that the starting of the machine on its aerial\r\ncourse was far from an easy matter.\r\n\r\nA soaring bird does not rise straight from the ground, but opens its\r\nwings and runs along the ground until the pressure of the air raises\r\nit sufficiently to give a full stroke of its pinions. Also it rises\r\n_against_ the wind to get the full benefit of its lifting force.\r\nProfessor Langley hired a houseboat on the Potomac River, and on the\r\ntop of it built an apparatus from which the aerodrome could be\r\nlaunched into space at high velocity.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1896, after a long wait for propitious weather, the\r\naerodrome was despatched on a trial trip. It rose in the face of the\r\nwind and travelled for over half a mile at the rate of twenty-five\r\nmiles an hour. The water and fuel being then exhausted it settled\r\nlightly on the water and was again launched. Its flight on both\r\noccasions was steady, and limited only by the rapid consumption of its\r\npower-producing elements. The Professor believes that larger machines\r\nwould remain in the air for a long period and travel at speeds\r\nhitherto unknown to us.\r\n\r\nIn both the machines that we have considered the propulsive power was\r\na screw. No counterpart of it is seen in Nature. This is not a valid\r\nargument against its employment, since no animal is furnished with\r\ndriving-wheels, nor does any fish carry a revolving propeller in its\r\ntail. But some inventors are strongly in favour of copying Nature as\r\nregards the employment of wings. Mr. Sydney H. Hollands, an\r\nenthusiastic aeromobilist, has devised an ingenious cylinder-motor so\r\narranged as to flap a pair of long wings, giving them a much stronger\r\nimpulse on the down than on the up stroke. The pectoral muscles of a\r\nbird are reproduced by two strong springs which are extended by the\r\nupward motion of the wings and store up energy for the down-stroke.\r\nClose attention is also being paid to the actual shape of a bird’s\r\nwing, which is not flat but hollow on its under side, and at the front\r\nhas a slightly downward dip. “Aerocurves” are therefore likely to\r\nsupersede the “aeroplane,” for Nature would not have built bird’s\r\nwings as they are without an object. The theory of the aerocurve’s\r\naction is this: that the front of the wing, on striking the air, gives\r\nit a downwards motion, and if the wing were quite flat its rear\r\nportion would strike air already in motion, and therefore less\r\nbuoyant. The curvature of a floating bird’s wings, which becomes more\r\nand more pronounced towards the rear, counteracts this yielding of the\r\nair by pressing harder upon it as it passes towards their hinder edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _M. Santos Dumont’s Airship returning to Longchamps\r\nafter doubling the Eiffel Tower, October 19, 1901._]\r\n\r\nThe aerocurve has been used by a very interesting group of\r\nexperimenters, those who, putting motors entirely aside, have floated\r\non wings, and learnt some of the secrets of balancing in the air. For\r\na man to propel himself by flapping wings moved by legs or arms is\r\nimpossible. Sir Hiram Maxim, in addressing the Aeronautical Society,\r\nonce said that for a man to successfully imitate a bird his lungs must\r\nweigh 40 lbs., to consume sufficient oxygen, his breast muscles 75\r\nlbs., and his breast bone be extended in front 21 inches. And unless\r\nhis total weight were increased his legs must dwindle to the size of\r\nbroomsticks, his head to that of an apple! So that for the present we\r\nshall be content to remain as we are!\r\n\r\nDr. Lilienthal, a German, was the first to try scientific\r\nwing-sailing. He became a regular air gymnast, running down the sides\r\nof an artificial mound until the wings lifted him up and enabled him\r\nto float a considerable distance before reaching earth again. His\r\nwings had an area of 160 square feet, or about a foot to every pound\r\nweight. He was killed by the wings collapsing in mid-air. A similar\r\nfate also overtook Mr. Percy Pilcher, who abandoned the initial run\r\ndown a sloping surface in favour of being towed on a rope attached to\r\na fast-moving vehicle. At present Mr. Octave Chanute, of Chicago, is\r\nthe most distinguished member of the “gliding” school. He employs,\r\ninstead of wings, a species of kite made up of a number of small\r\naerocurves placed one on the top of another a small distance apart.\r\nThese box kites are said to give a great lifting force for their\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThese and many other experimenters have had the same object in\r\nview--to learn the laws of equilibrium in the air. Until these are\r\nfully understood the construction of large flying-machines must be\r\nregarded as somewhat premature. Man must walk before he can run, and\r\nbalance himself before he can fly.\r\n\r\nThere is no falling off in the number of aërial machines and schemes\r\nbrought from time to time into public notice. We may assure ourselves\r\nthat if patient work and experiment can do it the problem of “how to\r\nfly” is not very far from solution at the present moment.\r\n\r\nAs a sign of the times, the War Office, not usually very ready to\r\ntake up a new idea, has interested itself in the airship, and\r\ncommissioned Dr. F. A. Barton to construct a dirigible balloon which\r\ncombines the two systems of aerostation. Propulsion is effected by six\r\nsets of triple propellers, three on each side. Ascent is brought about\r\npartly by a balloon 180 feet long, containing 156,000 cubic feet of\r\nhydrogen, partly by nine aeroplanes having a total superficial area of\r\nnearly 2000 square feet. The utilisation of these aeroplanes obviates\r\nthe necessity to throw out ballast to rise, or to let out gas for a\r\ndescent. The airship, being just heavier than air, is raised by the\r\n135 horse-power motors pressing the aeroplanes against the air at the\r\nproper angle. In descent they act as parachutes.\r\n\r\nThe most original feature of this war balloon is the automatic\r\nwater-balance. At each end of the “deck” is a tank holding forty\r\ngallons of water. Two pumps circulate water through these tanks, the\r\namount sent into a tank being regulated by a heavy pendulum which\r\nturns on the cock leading to the end which may be highest in\r\nproportion as it turns off that leading to the lower end. The idea is\r\nvery ingenious, and should work successfully when the time of trial\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nValuable money prizes will be competed for by aeronauts at the coming\r\nWorld’s Fair at St. Louis in 1903. Sir Hiram Maxim has expressed an\r\nintention of spending £20,000 in further experiments and prizes. In\r\nthis country, too, certain journals have offered large rewards to any\r\naeronaut who shall make prescribed journeys in a given time. It has\r\nalso been suggested that aeronautical research should be endowed by\r\nthe state, since England has nothing to fear more than the flying\r\nmachine and the submarine boat, each of which tends to rob her of the\r\nadvantages of being an island by exposing her to unexpected and unseen\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nTennyson, in a fine passage in “Locksley Hall,” turns a poetical eye\r\ntowards the future. This is what he sees--\r\n\r\n    “For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,\r\n    Saw the vision of the world and all the wonder that would be,\r\n    Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sail,\r\n    Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales,\r\n    Heard the heavens fill with shouting, then there rained a ghostly dew,\r\n    From the nations’ airy navies, grappling in the central blue.”\r\n\r\nExpressed in more prosaic language, the flying-machine will primarily\r\nbe used for military purposes. A country cannot spread a metal\r\numbrella over itself to protect its towns from explosives dropped from\r\nthe clouds.\r\n\r\nMail services will be revolutionised. The pleasure aerodrome will take\r\nthe place of the yacht and motor-car, affording grand opportunities\r\nfor the mountaineer and explorer (if the latter could find anything\r\nnew to explore). Then there will also be a direct route to the North\r\nPole over the top of those terrible icefields that have cost\r\ncivilisation so many gallant lives. And possibly the ease of transit\r\nwill bring the nations closer together, and produce good-fellowship\r\nand concord among them. It is pleasanter to regard the flying-machine\r\nof the future as a bringer of peace than as a novel means of spreading\r\ndeath and destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPE-SETTING BY MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Assyrian brickmakers who, thousands of years ago, used blocks\r\nwherewith to impress on their unbaked bricks hieroglyphics and\r\nsymbolical characters, must be attributed the first hesitating step\r\ntowards that most marvellous and revolutionary of human\r\ndiscoveries--the art of printing. Not, however, till the early part of\r\nthe fifteenth century did Gutenberg and Coster conceive the brilliant\r\nbut simple idea of printing from separate types, which could be set in\r\ndifferent orders and combinations to represent different ideas. For\r\nEnglishmen, 1474 deserves to rank with 1815, as in that year a very\r\nWaterloo was won on English soil against the forces of ignorance and\r\noppression, though the effects of the victory were not at once\r\nevident. Considering the stir made at the time by the appearance of\r\nCaxton’s first book at Westminster, it seems strange that an invention\r\nof such importance as the printing-press should have been frowned upon\r\nby those in power, and so discouraged that for nearly two centuries\r\nprinting remained an ill-used and unprogressive art, a giant half\r\nstrangled in his cradle. Yet as soon as prejudice gave it an open\r\nfield, improved methods followed close on one another’s heels. To-day\r\nwe have in the place of Caxton’s rude hand-made press great cylinder\r\nmachines capable of absorbing paper by the mile, and grinding out\r\n20,000 impressions an hour as easily as a child can unwind a reel of\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the problem how to produce the greatest possible\r\nnumber of copies in a given time from one machine, has arisen\r\nanother:--how to set up type with a proportionate rapidity. A press\r\nwithout type is as useless as a chaff-cutter without hay or straw. The\r\ntype once assembled, as many casts or stereotypes can be made from it\r\nas there are machines to be worked. But to arrange a large body of\r\ntype in a short time brings the printer face to face with the\r\nneed of employing the expensive services of a small army of\r\ncompositors--unless he can attain his end by some equally efficient\r\nand less costly means. For the last century a struggle has been in\r\nprogress between the machine compositor and the human compositor,\r\nmechanical ingenuity against eye and brains. In the last five years\r\nthe battle has turned most decidedly in favour of the machine. To-day\r\nthere are in existence two wonderful contrivances which enable a man\r\nto set up type six times as fast as he could by hand from a box of\r\ntype, with an ease that reminds one of the mythical machine for the\r\nconversion of live pigs into strings of sausages by an uninterrupted\r\nseries of movements.\r\n\r\nThese machines are called respectively the Linotype and Monotype.\r\nRoughly described, they are to the compositor what a typewriter is to\r\na clerk--forming words in obedience to the depression of keys on a\r\nkeyboard. But whereas the typewriter merely imprints a single\r\ncharacter on paper, the linotype and monotype cast, deliver, and set\r\nup type from which an indefinite number of impressions can be taken.\r\nThey meet the compositor more than half-way, and simplify his labour\r\nwhile hugely increasing his productiveness.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1842 periodicals were mechanically composed by a\r\nmachine which is now practically forgotten. Since that time hundreds\r\nof other inventions have been patented, and some scores of different\r\nmachines tried, though with small success in most cases; as it was\r\nfound that quality of composition was sacrificed to quantity, and that\r\nwhat at first appeared a short cut to the printing-press was after all\r\nthe longest way round, when corrections had all been attended to. A\r\nreally economical type-setter must be accurate as well as prolific.\r\nSlipshod work will not pay in the long run.\r\n\r\nSuch a machine was perfected a few years ago by Ottmar Mergenthaler of\r\nBaltimore, who devised the plan of casting a whole _line of type_. The\r\nLinotype Composing Machine, to give it its full title, produces type\r\nall ready for the presses in “slugs” or lines--hence the name, Lin’ o’\r\ntype. It deserves at least a short description.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype occupies about six square feet of floor space, weighs one\r\nton, and is entirely operated by one man. Its most prominent features\r\nare a sloping magazine at the top to hold the brass matrices, or\r\ndies from which the type is cast, a keyboard controlling the machinery\r\nto drop and collect the dies, and a long lever which restores the dies\r\nto the magazine when done with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of The Linotype Co._\r\n\r\n_The Linotype Machine. By pressing keys on the key-board the operator\r\ncauses lines of type to be set up, cast, and arranged on the “galley”\r\nready for the printers._]\r\n\r\nThe operator sits facing the keyboard, in which are ninety keys,\r\nvariously coloured to distinguish the different kinds of letters. His\r\nhands twinkle over the keys, and the brass dies fly into place. When a\r\nkey is depressed a die shoots from the magazine on to a travelling\r\nbelt and is whirled off to the assembling-box. Each die is a flat,\r\noblong brass plate, of a thickness varying with the letter, having a\r\nlarge V-shaped notch in the top, and the letter cut half-way down on\r\none of the longer sides. A corresponding letter is stamped on the side\r\nnearest to the operator so that he may see what he is doing and make\r\nneedful corrections.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a word is complete, he touches the “spacing” lever at the\r\nside of the keyboard. The action causes a “space” to be placed against\r\nthe last die to separate it from the following word. The operations\r\nare repeated until the tinkle of a bell warns him that, though there\r\nmay be room for one or two more letters, the line will not admit\r\nanother whole syllable. The line must therefore be “justified,” that\r\nis, the spaces between the words increased till the vacant room is\r\nfilled in. In hand composition this takes a considerable time, and is\r\nirksome; but at the linotype the operator merely twists a handle and\r\nthe wedge-shaped “spaces,” placed thin end upwards, are driven up\r\nsimultaneously, giving the lateral expansion required to make the line\r\nof the right measure.\r\n\r\nA word about the “spaces,” or space-bands. Were each a single wedge\r\nthe pressure would be on the bottom only of the dies, and their tops,\r\nbeing able to move slightly, would admit lead between them. To obviate\r\nthis a small second wedge, thin end _downwards_, is arranged to slide\r\non the larger wedge, so that in all positions parallelism is secured.\r\nThis smaller wedge is of the same shape as the dies and remains\r\nstationary in line with them, the larger one only moving.\r\n\r\nThe line of dies being now complete, it is automatically borne off and\r\npressed into contact with the casting wheel. This wheel, revolving on\r\nits centre, has a slit in it corresponding in length and width to the\r\nsize of line required. At first the slit is horizontal, and the dies\r\nfit against it so that the row of sunk letters on the faces are in the\r\nexact position to receive the molten lead, which is squirted through\r\nthe slit from behind by an automatic pump, supplied from a metal-pot.\r\nThe pot is kept at a proper heat of 550° Fahrenheit by the flames of a\r\nBunsen burner.\r\n\r\nThe lead solidifies in an instant, and the “slug” of type is ready for\r\nremoval, after its back has been carefully trimmed by a knife. The\r\nwheel revolves for a quarter-turn, bringing the slit into a vertical\r\nposition; a punch drives out the “slug,” which is slid into the galley\r\nto join its predecessors. The wheel then resumes its former horizontal\r\nposition in readiness for another cast.\r\n\r\nThe assembled dies have for the time done their work and must be\r\nreturned to the magazine. The mechanism used to effect this is\r\npeculiarly ingenious.\r\n\r\nAn arm carrying a ribbed bar descends. The dies are pushed up, leaving\r\nthe “spaces” behind to be restored to their proper compartment, till\r\non a level with the ribbed bar, on to which they are slid by a lateral\r\nmovement, the notches of the V-shaped opening in the top side of each\r\ndie engaging with the ribs on the bar. The bar then ascends till it is\r\nin line with a longer bar of like section passing over the open top of\r\nthe entire magazine. A set of horizontal screw-bars, rotating at high\r\nspeed, transfer the dies from the short to the long bar, along which\r\nthey move till, as a die comes above its proper division of the\r\nmagazine, the arrangement of the teeth allows it to drop. While all\r\nthis has been going on, the operator has composed another line of\r\nmoulds, which will in turn be transferred to the casting wheel, and\r\nthen back to the magazine. So that the three operations of composing,\r\ncasting, and sorting moulds are in progress simultaneously in\r\ndifferent parts of the machine; with the result that as many as 20,000\r\nletters can be formed by an expert in the space of an hour, against\r\nthe 1500 letters of a skilled hand compositor.\r\n\r\nHow about corrections? Even a comma too few or too many needs the\r\nwhole line cast over again. It is a convincing proof of the difference\r\nin speed between the two methods that a column of type can be\r\ncorrected much faster by the machine, handicapped as it is by its\r\nsolid “slugs,” than by hand. No wonder then that more than 1000\r\nlinotypes are to be found in the printing offices of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Monotype, like the Linotype, aims at speed in composition, but in\r\nits mechanism it differs essentially from the linotype. In the first\r\nplace, the apparatus is constructed in two quite separate parts. There\r\nis a keyboard, which may be on the third floor of the printing\r\noffices, and the casting machine, which ceaselessly casts and sets\r\ntype in the basement. Yet they are but one whole. The connecting link\r\nis the long strip of paper punched by the keyboard mechanism, and then\r\ntransferred to the casting machine to bring about the formation of\r\ntype. The keyboard is the servant of man; the casting machine is the\r\nslave of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Monotype casts type, not in blocks or a whole line, but\r\nin separate letters. It is thus a complete type-foundry. Order it to\r\ncast G’s and it will turn them out by the thousand till another letter\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nThirdly, by means of the punched paper roll, the same type can be set\r\nup time after time without a second recourse to the keyboard, just as\r\na tune is ground repeatedly out of a barrel organ.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard has a formidable appearance. It contains 225 keys,\r\nproviding as many characters; also thirty keys to regulate the spacing\r\nof the words. At the back of the machine a roll of paper runs over\r\nrollers and above a row of thirty little punches worked by the keys.\r\nA key being depressed, an opened valve admits air into two cylinders,\r\neach driving a punch. The punches fly up and cut two neat little holes\r\nin the paper. The roll then moves forward for the next letter. At the\r\nend of the word a special lever is used to register a space, and so on\r\nto the end of the line. The operator then consults an automatic\r\nindicator which tells him exactly how much space is left, and how much\r\ntoo long or too short the line would be if the spaces were of the\r\nnormal size. Supposing, for instance, that there are ten spaces, and\r\nthat there is one-tenth of an inch to spare. It is obvious that by\r\nextending each space one-hundredth of an inch the vacant room will be\r\nexactly filled. Similarly, if the ten normal spaces would make the\r\nline one-tenth of an inch too _long_, by _decreasing_ the spaces each\r\none-hundredth inch the line will also be “justified.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By kind permission of_] [_The Monotype Co._\r\n\r\n_The Monotype Casting Machine. A punched paper roll fed through the\r\ntop of the machine automatically casts and sets up type in separate\r\nletters._]\r\n\r\nBut the operator need not trouble his head about calculations of this\r\nkind. His indicator, a vertical cylinder covered with tiny squares, in\r\neach of which are printed two figures, tell him exactly what he has to\r\ndo. On pressing a certain key the cylinder revolves and comes to rest\r\nwith the tip of a pointer over a square. The operator at once presses\r\ndown the keys bearing the numbers printed on that square, confident\r\nthat the line will be of the proper length.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the roll is finished, it is detached from the keyboard and\r\nintroduced to the casting machine. Hitherto passive, it now becomes\r\nactive. Having been placed in position on the rollers it is slowly\r\nunwound by the machinery. The paper passes over a hollow bar in which\r\nthere are as many holes as there were punches in the keyboard, and in\r\nprecisely the same position. When a hole in the paper comes over a\r\nhole in the hollow bar air rushes in, and passing through a tube\r\nactuates the type-setting machinery in a certain manner, so as to\r\nbring the desired die into contact with molten lead. The dies are, in\r\nthe monotype, all carried in a magazine about three inches square,\r\nwhich moves backwards or forwards, to right or left, in obedience to\r\norders from the perforated roll. The dies are arranged in exactly the\r\nsame way as the keys on the keyboard. So that, supposing A to have\r\nbeen stamped on the roll, one of the perforations causes the magazine\r\nto slide one way, while the other shoves it another, until the\r\ncombined motions bring the matrix engraved with the A underneath the\r\nsmall hole through which molten lead is forced. The letter is ejected\r\nand moves sideways through a narrow channel, pushing preceding letters\r\nbefore it, and the magazine is free for other movements.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each word a “space” or blank lead is cast, its size\r\nexactly determined by the “justifying” hole belonging to that line.\r\nWord follows word till the line is complete; then a knife-like lever\r\nrises, and the type is propelled into the “galley.” Though a slave the\r\ncasting machine will not tolerate injustice. Should the compositor\r\nhave made a mistake, so that the line is too long or too short,\r\nautomatic machinery at once comes into play, and slips the driving\r\nbelt from the fixed to the loose pulley, thus stopping the machine\r\ntill some one can attend to it. But if the punching has been correctly\r\ndone, the machine will work away unattended till, a whole column of\r\ntype having been set up, it comes to a standstill.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Monotype are easily seen. In order to save money\r\na man need not possess the complete apparatus. If he has the keyboard\r\nonly he becomes to a certain extent his own compositor, able to set up\r\nthe type, as it were by proxy, at any convenient time. He can give his\r\nundivided attention to the keyboard, stop work whenever he likes\r\nwithout keeping a casting-machine idle, and as soon as his roll is\r\ncomplete forward it to a central establishment where type is set.\r\nThere a single man can superintend the completion of half-a-dozen\r\nmen’s labours at the keyboard. That means a great reduction of\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIn due time he receives back his copy in the shape of set-up type, all\r\nready to be corrected and transferred to the printing machines. The\r\ntype done with, he can melt it down without fear of future regret, for\r\nhe knows that the paper roll locked up in his cupboard will do its\r\nwork a second time as well as it did the first. Should he need the\r\nsame matter re-setting, he has only to send the roll through the post\r\nto the central establishment.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mr. Lanston’s invention we may hope for the day when every\r\nparish will be able to do its own printing, or at least set up its own\r\nmagazine. The only thing needful will be a monotype keyboard supplied\r\nby an enlightened Parish Council--as soon as the expense appears\r\njustifiable--and kept in the Post Office or Village Institute. The\r\npayment of a small fee will entitle the Squire to punch out his speech\r\non behalf of the Conservative Candidate, the Schoolmaster to compose\r\nspecial information for his pupils, the Rector to reduce to print\r\npamphlets and appeals to charity. And if those of humbler degree think\r\nthey can strike eloquence from the keys, they too will of course be\r\nallowed to turn out their ideas literally by the yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY IN COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile photography was still in its infancy many people believed that,\r\na means having been found of impressing the representation of an\r\nobject on a sensitised surface, a short time only would have to elapse\r\nbefore the discovery of some method of registering the colours as well\r\nas the forms of nature.\r\n\r\nPhotography has during the last forty years passed through some\r\nstartling developments, especially as regards speed. Experts, such as\r\nM. Marey, have proved the superiority of the camera over the human eye\r\nin its power to grasp the various phases of animal motion. Even rifle\r\nbullets have been arrested in their lightning flight by the sensitised\r\nplate. But while the camera is a valuable aid to the eye in the matter\r\nof form, the eye still has the advantage so far as colour is\r\nconcerned. It is still impossible for a photographer by a simple\r\nprocess similar to that of making an ordinary black-and-white\r\nnegative, to affect a plate in such a manner that from it prints may\r\nbe made by a single operation showing objects in their natural\r\ncolours. Nor, for the matter of that, does colour photography direct\r\nfrom nature seem any nearer attainment now than it was in the time of\r\nDaguerre.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, extant several methods of making colour\r\nphotographs in an indirect or roundabout way. These various “dodges”\r\nare, apart from their beautiful results, so extremely ingenious and\r\ninteresting that we propose to here examine three of the best known.\r\n\r\nThe reader must be careful to banish from his mind those _coloured_\r\nphotographs so often to be seen in railway carriages and shop windows,\r\nwhich are purely the result of hand-work and mechanical printing, and\r\ntherefore not _colour_ photographs at all.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking on an explanation of these three methods it will be\r\nnecessary to examine briefly the nature of those phenomena on which\r\nall are based--light and colour. The two are really identical, light\r\nis colour and colour is light.\r\n\r\nScientists now agree that the sensation of light arises from the\r\nwave-like movements of that mysterious fluid, the omnipresent ether.\r\nIn a beam of white light several rates of wave vibrations exist side\r\nby side. Pass the beam through a prism and the various rapidities are\r\nsorted out into violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red,\r\nwhich are called the pure colours, since if any of them be passed\r\nagain through a prism the result is still that colour. Crimson, brown,\r\n&c., the composite colours, would, if subjected to the prism, at once\r\nsplit up into their component pure colours.\r\n\r\nThere are several points to be noticed about the relationship of the\r\nseven pure colours. In the first place, though they are all allies in\r\nthe task of making white light, there is hostility among them, each\r\nbeing jealous of the others, and only waiting a chance to show it.\r\nThus, suppose that we have on a strip of paper squares of the seven\r\ncolours, and look at the strip through a piece of red glass we see\r\nonly one square--the red--in its natural colour, since that square is\r\nin harmony only with red rays. (Compare the sympathy of a piano with a\r\nnote struck on another instrument; if C is struck, say on a violin,\r\nthe piano strings producing the corresponding note will sound, but the\r\nother strings will be silent.) The orange square suggests orange, but\r\nthe green and blue and violet appear black. Red glass has arrested\r\ntheir ether vibrations and said “no way here.” Green and violet would\r\nserve just the same trick on red or on each other. It is from this\r\nreadiness to absorb or stop dissimilar rays that we have the different\r\ncolours in a landscape flooded by a common white sunlight. The trees\r\nand grass absorb all but the green rays, which they reflect. The\r\ndandelions and buttercups capture and hold fast all but the yellow\r\nrays. The poppies in the corn send us back red only, and the\r\ncornflowers only blue; but the daisy is more generous and gives up all\r\nthe seven. Colour therefore is not a thing that can be touched, any\r\nmore than sound, but merely the capacity to affect the retina of the\r\neye with a certain number of ether vibrations per second, and it makes\r\nno difference whether light is reflected from a substance or refracted\r\nthrough a substance; a red brick and a piece of red glass have similar\r\neffects on the eye.\r\n\r\nThis then is the first thing to be clearly grasped, that whenever a\r\ncolour has a chance to make prisoners of other colours it will do so.\r\n\r\nThe second point is rather more intricate, viz. that this imprisonment\r\nis going on even when friendly concord appears to be the order of the\r\nday. Let us endeavour to present this clearly to the reader. Of the\r\npure colours, violet, green and red--the extremes and the centre--are\r\nsufficient to produce white, because each contains an element of its\r\nneighbours. Violet has a certain amount of indigo, green some yellow,\r\nred some orange; in fact every colour of the spectrum contains a\r\ngreater or less degree of several of the others, but not enough to\r\ndestroy its own identity. Now, suppose that we have three lanterns\r\nprojecting their rays on to the same portion of a white sheet, and\r\nthat in front of the first is placed a violet glass, in front of the\r\nsecond a green glass, in front of the third a red glass. What is the\r\nresult? A white light. Why? Because they meet _on equal terms_, and as\r\nno one of them is in a point of advantage no prisoners can be made and\r\nthey must work in harmony. Next, turn down the violet lantern, and\r\ngreen and red produce a yellow, half-way between them; turn down red\r\nand turn up violet, indigo-blue results. All the way through a\r\ncompromise is effected.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that the red and green glasses are put in front of the\r\n_same_ lantern and the white light sent through them--where has the\r\nyellow gone to? only a brownish-black light reaches the screen. The\r\nsame thing happens with red and violet or green and violet.\r\n\r\nPrisoners have been taken, because one colour has had to _demand\r\npassage_ from the other. Red says to green, “You want your rays to\r\npass through me, but they shall not.” Green retorts, “Very well; but I\r\nmyself have already cut off all but green rays, and if they don’t pass\r\nyou, nothing shall.” And the consequence of the quarrel is practical\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon may be illustrated with blue and yellow. Lights of\r\nthese two colours projected simultaneously on to a sheet yield white;\r\nbut white light sent through blue and yellow glass _in succession_\r\nproduces a green light. Also, blue paint mixed with yellow gives\r\ngreen. In neither case is there darkness or entire cutting-off of\r\ncolour, as in the case of Red + Violet or Green + Red.\r\n\r\nThe reason is easy to see.\r\n\r\nBlue light is a compromise of violet and green; yellow of green and\r\nred. Hence the two coloured lights falling on the screen make a\r\ncombination which can be expressed as an addition sum.\r\n\r\n    Blue   = green + violet.\r\n    Yellow = green + red.\r\n             --------------------\r\n             green + violet + red = white.\r\n\r\nBut when light is passed _through_ two coloured glasses in succession,\r\nor reflected from two layers of coloured paints, there are prisoners\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\nBlue passes green and violet only.\r\n\r\nYellow passes green and red only.\r\n\r\nSo violet is captured by yellow, and red by blue, green being free to\r\npass on its way.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a great difference between the _mixing_ of colours,\r\nwhich evokes any tendency to antagonism, and the _adding_ of colours\r\nunder such conditions that they meet on equal terms. The first process\r\nhappens, as we have seen, when a ray of light is passed through\r\ncolours _in succession_; the second, when lights stream simultaneously\r\non to an object. A white screen, being capable of reflecting any\r\ncolour that falls on to it, will with equal readiness show green, red,\r\nviolet, or a combination; but a substance that is in white light red,\r\nor green, or violet will capture any other colour. So that if for the\r\nwhite screen we substituted a red one, violet or green falling\r\nsimultaneously, would yield blackness, because red takes _both_\r\nprisoners; if it were violet, green would be captured, and so on.\r\n\r\nFrom this follows another phenomenon: that whereas projection of two\r\nor more lights may yield white, white cannot result from any mixture\r\nof pigments. A person with a whole boxful of paints could not get\r\nwhite were he to mix them in an infinitude of different ways; but with\r\nthe aid of his lanterns and as many differently coloured glasses the\r\nfeat is easy enough.\r\n\r\nAny two colours which meet on equal terms to make white are called\r\n_complementary_ colours.\r\n\r\n     Thus yellow (= red + green lights) is complementary of violet.\r\n\r\n      Thus pink (= red + violet lights) is complementary of green.\r\n\r\n      Thus blue (= violet + green lights) is complementary of red.\r\n\r\nThis does not of course apply to mixture of paints, for complementary\r\ncolours must act together, not in antagonism.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has mastered these preliminary considerations he will\r\nhave no difficulty in following out the following processes.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Joly Process_, invented by Professor Joly of Dublin. A\r\nglass plate is ruled across with fine parallel lines--350 to the inch,\r\nwe believe. These lines are filled in alternately with violet, green,\r\nand red matter, every third being violet, green or red as the case may\r\nbe. The colour-screen is placed in the camera in front of the\r\nsensitised plate. Upon an exposure being made, all light reflected\r\nfrom a red object (to select a colour) is allowed to pass through the\r\nred lines, but blocked by all the green and violet lines. So that on\r\ndevelopment that part of the negative corresponding to the position of\r\nthe red object will be covered with dark lines separated by\r\ntransparent belts of twice the breadth. From the negative a positive\r\nis printed, which of course shows transparent lines separated by\r\nopaque belts of twice their breadth. Now, suppose that we take the\r\ncolour-screen and place it again in front of the plate in the position\r\nit occupied when the negative was taken, the red lines being opposite\r\nthe transparent parts of the positive will be visible, but the green\r\nand violet being blocked by the black deposit behind them will not be\r\nnoticeable. So that the object is represented by a number of red\r\nlines, which at a small distance appear to blend into a continuous\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe violet and green affect the plate in a corresponding manner; and\r\ncomposite colours will affect two sets of lines in varying degrees,\r\nthe lights from the two sets blending in the eye. Thus yellow will\r\nobtain passage from both green and red, and when the screen is held up\r\nagainst the positive, the light streaming through the green and red\r\nlines will blend into yellow in the same manner as they would make\r\nyellow if projected by lanterns on to a screen. The same applies to\r\nall the colours.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the Joly process is that in it only one negative has\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Ives Process._--Mr. Frederic Eugene Ives, of Philadelphia,\r\narrives at the same result as Professor Joly, but by an entirely\r\ndifferent means. He takes three negatives of the same object, one\r\nthrough a violet-blue, another through a green, and a third through a\r\nred screen placed in front of the lens. The red negative is affected\r\nby red rays only; the green by green rays only, and the violet-blue by\r\nviolet-blue rays only, in the proper gradations. That is to say, each\r\nnegative will have opaque patches wherever the rays of a certain kind\r\nstrike it; and the positive printed off will be by consequence\r\ntransparent at the same places. By holding the positive made from the\r\nred-screen negative against a piece of red glass, we should see light\r\nonly in those parts of the positive which were transparent. Similarly\r\nwith the green and violet positives if viewed through glasses of\r\nproper colour. The most ingenious part of Mr. Ives’ method is the\r\napparatus for presenting all three positives (lighted through their\r\ncoloured glasses) to the eye simultaneously. When properly adjusted,\r\nso that their various parts exactly coincide, the eye blends the three\r\ntogether, seeing green, red, or violet separately, or blended in\r\ncorrect proportions. The Kromoscope, as the viewing apparatus is\r\ntermed, contains three mirrors, projecting the reflections from the\r\npositives in a single line. As the three slides are taken\r\nstereoscopically the result gives the impression of solidity as well\r\nas of colour, and is most realistic.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Sanger Shepherd Process._--This is employed mostly for\r\nlantern transparencies. As in the Ives process, three negatives and\r\nthree transparent positives are made. But instead of coloured glasses\r\nbeing used to give effect to the positives the positives themselves\r\nare dyed, and placed one on the top of another in close contact, so\r\nthat the light from the lantern passes through them in succession. We\r\nhave therefore now quitted the realms of harmony for that of discord,\r\nin which prisoners are made; and Mr. Shepherd has had to so arrange\r\nmatters that in every case the capture of prisoners does not interfere\r\nwith the final result, but conduces to it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, three negatives are secured through violet, green,\r\nand red screens. Positives are printed by the carbon process on thin\r\ncelluloid films. The carbon film contains gelatine and bichromate of\r\npotassium. The light acts on the bichromate in such a way as to render\r\nthe gelatine insoluble. The result is that, though in the positives\r\nthere is at first no colour, patches of gelatine are left which will\r\nabsorb dyes of various colours. The dyeing process requires a large\r\namount of care and patience.\r\n\r\nNow, it would be a mistake to suppose that each positive is dyed in\r\nthe colour of the screen through which its negative was taken. A\r\nmoment’s consideration will show us why.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that we are photographing a red object, a flower-pot for\r\ninstance. The red negative represents the pot by a dark deposit. The\r\npositive printed off will consequently show clear glass at that spot,\r\nthe unaffected gelatine being soluble. So that to dye the plate would\r\nbe to make all red _except_ the very part which we require red; and on\r\nholding it up to the light the flower-pot would appear as a white\r\ntransparent patch.\r\n\r\nHow then is the problem to be solved?\r\n\r\nMr. Shepherd’s process is based upon an ordered system of\r\nprisoner-taking. Thus, as red in this particular case is wanted it\r\nwill be attained by the _other two_ positives (which are placed in\r\ncontact with the red positive, so that all three coincide exactly),\r\nrobbing white light of all _but_ its red rays.\r\n\r\nNow if the other positives were dyed green and violet, what would\r\nhappen? They would not produce red, but by robbing white light between\r\nthem of red, green, and violet, would produce blackness, and we should\r\nbe as far as ever from our object.\r\n\r\nThe positives are therefore dyed, not in the same colours as the\r\nscreens used when the negatives were made, but in their\r\n_complementary_ colours, _i.e._ as explained above, those colours\r\nwhich added to the colour of the screen would make white.\r\n\r\nThe red screen negative is therefore dyed (violet + green) = blue. The\r\ngreen negative (red + violet) = pink. The violet negative (red +\r\ngreen) = yellow.\r\n\r\nTo return to our flower-pot. The red-screen positive (dyed blue) is,\r\nas we saw, quite transparent where the pot should be. But behind the\r\ntransparent gap are the pink and yellow positives.\r\n\r\nWhite light (= violet + green + red) passes through pink (= violet +\r\nred), and has to surrender all its green rays. The violet and red pass\r\non and encounter yellow (= green + red), and violet falls a victim to\r\ngreen, leaving red unmolested.\r\n\r\nIf the flower-pot had been white all three positives would have\r\ncontained clear patches unaffected by the three dyes, and the white\r\nlight would have been unobstructed. The gradations and mixtures of\r\ncolours are obtained by two of the screens being influenced by the\r\ncolour of the object. Thus, if it were crimson, both violet and\r\nred-screen negatives would be affected by the rays reflected by it,\r\nand the green screen negative not at all. Hence the pink positive\r\nwould be pink, the yellow clear, and the blue clear.\r\n\r\nWhite light passing through is robbed by pink of green, leaving red +\r\nviolet = crimson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR PRINTING.\r\n\r\nPrinting in ink colours is done in a manner very similar to the Sanger\r\nShepherd lantern slide process. Three blocks are made, by the help of\r\nphotography, through violet, green and red screens, and etched away\r\nwith acid, like ordinary half-tone black-and-white blocks. The three\r\nblocks have applied to them ink of a complementary colour to the\r\nscreen they represent, just as in the Sanger Shepherd process the\r\npositives were dyed. The three inks are laid over one another on the\r\npaper by the blocks, the relieved parts of which (corresponding to the\r\nundissolved gelatine of the Shepherd positives) only take the ink.\r\nWhite light being reflected through layers of coloured inks is treated\r\nin just the same way as it would be were it transmitted through\r\ncoloured glasses, yielding all the colours in approximately correct\r\ngradations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe production of fire by artificial means has been reasonably\r\nregarded as the greatest invention in the history of the human race.\r\nPrior to the day when a man was first able to call heat from the\r\nsubstances about him the condition of our ancestors must have been\r\nwretched indeed. Raw food was their portion; metals mingled with other\r\nmatter mocked their efforts to separate them; the cold of winter drove\r\nthem to the recesses of gloomy caverns, where night reigned perpetual.\r\n\r\nThe production of fire also, of course, entailed the creation of\r\nlight, which in its developments has been of an importance second only\r\nto the improved methods of heating. So accustomed are we to our\r\ncandles, our lamps, our gas-jets, our electric lights, that it is hard\r\nfor us to imagine what an immense effect their sudden and complete\r\nremoval would have on our existence. At times, when floods,\r\nexplosions, or other accidents cause a temporary stoppage of the gas\r\nor current supply, a town may for a time be plunged into darkness; but\r\nthis only for a short period, the distress of which can be alleviated\r\nby recourse to paraffin lamps, or the more homely candle.\r\n\r\nThe earliest method of illumination was the rough-and-ready one of\r\nkindling a pile of brushwood or logs. The light produced was very\r\nuncertain and feeble, but possibly sufficient for the needs of the\r\ncave-dweller. With the advance of civilisation arose an increasing\r\nnecessity for a more steady illuminant, discovered in vegetable oils,\r\nburned in lamps of various designs. Lamps have been found in old\r\nEgyptian and Etruscan tombs constructed thousands of years ago. These\r\nlamps do not differ essentially from those in use to-day, being\r\nreservoirs fitted with a channel to carry a wick.\r\n\r\nBut probably from the difficulty of procuring oil, lamps fell into\r\ncomparative disuse, or rather were almost unknown, in many countries\r\nof Europe as late as the fifteenth century; when the cottage and\r\nbaronial hall were alike lit by the blazing torch fixed into an iron\r\nsconce or bracket on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe rushlight, consisting of a peeled rush, coated by repeated dipping\r\ninto a vessel of melted fat, made a feeble effort to dispel the gloom\r\nof long winter evenings. This was succeeded by the tallow and more\r\nscientifically made wax candle, which last still maintains a certain\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nHow our grandmothers managed to “keep their eyes” as they worked at\r\nstitching by the light of a couple of candles, whose advent was the\r\nevent of the evening, is now a mystery. To-day we feel aggrieved if\r\nour lamps are not of many candle-power, and protest that our sight\r\nwill be ruined by what one hundred and fifty years ago would have\r\nseemed a marvel of illumination. In the case of lighting necessity has\r\nbeen the mother of invention. The tendency of modern life is to turn\r\nnight into day. We go to bed late and we get up late; this is perhaps\r\nfoolish, but still we do it. And, what is more, we make increasing use\r\nof places, such as basements, underground tunnels, and “tubes,” to\r\nwhich the light of heaven cannot penetrate during any of the daily\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century saw a wonderful advance in the science of\r\nillumination. As early as 1804 the famous scientist, Sir Humphrey\r\nDavy, discovered the electric arc, presently to be put to such\r\nuniversal use. About the same time gas was first manufactured and led\r\nabout in pipes. But before electricity for lighting purposes had been\r\nrendered sufficiently cheap the discovery of the huge oil deposits in\r\nPennsylvania flooded the world with an inexpensive illuminant. As\r\nearly as the thirteenth century Marco Polo, the explorer, wrote of a\r\nnatural petroleum spring at Baku, on the Caspian Sea: “There is a\r\nfountain of great abundance, inasmuch as a thousand shiploads might be\r\ntaken from it at one time. This oil is not good to use with food, but\r\nit is _good to burn_; and is also used to anoint camels that have the\r\nmange. People come from vast distances to fetch it, for in all other\r\ncountries there is no oil.” His last words have been confuted by the\r\nAmerican oil-fields, yielding many thousands of barrels a day--often\r\nin such quantities that the oil runs to waste for lack of a buyer.\r\n\r\nThe rivals for pre-eminence in lighting to-day are electricity, coal\r\ngas, petroleum, and acetylene gas. The two former have the advantage\r\nof being easily turned on at will, like water; the third is more\r\ngenerally available.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the dynamo by Gramme in 1870 marks the beginning of\r\nan epoch in the history of illumination. With its aid current of such\r\nintensity as to constantly bridge an air-gap between carbon points\r\ncould be generated for a fraction of the cost entailed by other\r\nprevious methods. Paul Jablochkoff devised in 1876 his “electric\r\ncandle”--a couple of parallel carbon rods separated by an insulating\r\nmedium that wasted away under the influence of heat at the same rate\r\nas the rods. The “candles” were used with rapidly-alternating\r\ncurrents, as the positive “pole” wasted twice as quickly as the\r\nnegative. During the Paris Exhibition of 1878 visitors to Paris were\r\ndelighted by the new method of illumination installed in some of the\r\nprincipal streets and theatres.\r\n\r\nThe arc-lamp of to-day, such as we see in our streets, factories, and\r\nrailway stations, is a modification of M. Jablochkoff’s principle.\r\nCarbon rods are used, but they are pointed towards each other, the\r\ndistance between their extremities being kept constant by ingenious\r\nmechanical contrivances. Arc-lamps of all types labour under the\r\ndisadvantage of being, by necessity, very powerful; and were they only\r\navailable the employment of electric lighting would be greatly\r\nrestricted. As it is, we have, thanks to the genius of Mr. Edison, a\r\nmeans of utilising current in but small quantities to yield a gentler\r\nlight. The glow-lamp, as it is called, is so familiar to us that we\r\nought to know something of its antecedents.\r\n\r\nIn the arc-lamp the electric circuit is _broken_ at the point where\r\nlight is required. In glow or incandescent lamps the current is only\r\n_hindered_ by the interposition of a bad conductor of electricity,\r\nwhich must also be incombustible. Just as a current of water flows in\r\nless volume as the bore of a pipe is reduced, and requires that\r\ngreater pressure shall be exerted to force a constant amount through\r\nthe pipe, so is an electric current _choked_ by its conductor being\r\nreduced in size or altered in nature. Edison in 1878 employed as the\r\ncurrent-choker a very fine platinum wire, which, having a melting\r\ntemperature of 3450 degrees Fahrenheit, allowed a very white heat to\r\nbe generated in it. The wire was enclosed in a glass bulb almost\r\nentirely exhausted of air by a mercury-pump before being sealed. But\r\nit was found that even platinum could not always withstand the heating\r\neffect of a strong current; and accordingly Edison looked about for\r\nsome less combustible material. Mr. J. W. Swan of Newcastle-on-Tyne\r\nhad already experimented with carbon filaments made from cotton\r\nthreads steeped in sulphuric acid. Edison and Swan joined hands to\r\nproduce the present well-known lamp, “The Ediswan,” the filament of\r\nwhich is a bamboo fibre, carbonised during the exhaustion of air in\r\nthe bulb to one-millionth of an atmosphere pressure by passing the\r\nelectric current through it. These bamboo filaments are very elastic\r\nand capable of standing almost any heat.\r\n\r\nGlow-lamps are made in all sizes--from tiny globes small enough to top\r\na tie-pin to powerful lamps of 1000 candle-power. Their independence\r\nof atmospheric air renders them most convenient in places where other\r\nforms of illumination would be dangerous or impossible; _e.g._ in coal\r\nmines, and under water during diving operations. By their aid great\r\nimprovements have been effected in the lighting of theatres, which\r\nrequire a quick switching on and off of light. They have also been\r\nused in connection with minute cameras to explore the recesses of the\r\nhuman body. In libraries they illuminate without injuring the books.\r\nIn living rooms they do not foul the air or blacken the ceiling like\r\noil or gas burners. The advantages of the “Edison lamp” are, in short,\r\nmultitudinous.\r\n\r\nCheapness of current to work them is, of course, a very important\r\ncondition of their economy. In some small country villages the\r\ncottages are lit by electricity even in England, but these are\r\ngenerally within easy reach of water power. Mountainous districts,\r\nsuch as Norway and Switzerland, with their rushing streams and high\r\nwater-falls, are peculiarly suited for electric lighting: the cost of\r\nwhich is mainly represented by the expense of the generating apparatus\r\nand the motive power.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest engineering undertakings in the world is connected\r\nwith the manufacture of electric current. Niagara, the “Thunder of the\r\nWaters” as the Indians called it, has been harnessed to produce\r\nelectrical energy, convertible at will into motion, heat, or light.\r\nThe falls pass all the water overflowing from nearly 100,000 square\r\nmiles of lakes, which in turn drain a far larger area of territory.\r\nUpwards of 10,000 cubic yards of water leap over the falls every\r\nsecond, and are hurled downwards for more than 200 feet, with an\r\nenergy of eight or nine million horse-power! In 1886 a company\r\ndetermined to turn some of this huge force to account. They bought up\r\nland on the American bank, and cut a tunnel 6700 yards long, beginning\r\na mile and a half above the falls, and terminating below them. Water\r\ndrawn from the river thunders into the tunnel through a number of\r\nwheel pits, at the bottom of each of which is a water-turbine\r\ndeveloping 5000 horse-power. The united force of the turbines is said\r\nto approximate 100,000 horse-power; and as if this were but a small\r\nthing, the same Company has obtained concessions to erect plant on the\r\nCanadian bank to double or treble the total power.\r\n\r\nSo cheaply is current thus produced that the Company is in a position\r\nto supply it at rates which appear small compared with those that\r\nprevail in this country. A farthing will there purchase what would\r\nhere cost from ninepence to a shilling. Under such conditions the\r\nelectric lamp need fear no competitor.\r\n\r\nBut in less favoured districts gas and petroleum are again holding up\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nBoth coal and oil-gas develop a great amount of heat in proportion to\r\nthe light they yield. The hydrogen they contain in large quantities\r\nburns, when pure, with an almost invisible flame, but more hotly than\r\nany other known gas. The particles of carbon also present in the flame\r\nare heated to whiteness by the hydrogen, but they are not sufficient\r\nin number to convert more than a fraction of the heat into light.\r\n\r\nA German, Auer von Welsbach, conceived the idea of suspending round\r\nthe flame a circular “mantle” of woven cotton steeped in a solution of\r\ncertain rare earths (_e.g._ lanthanum, yttrium, zirconium), to arrest\r\nthe heat and compel it to produce bright incandescence in the\r\narresting substance.\r\n\r\nWith the same gas consumption a Welsbach burner yields seven or more\r\ntimes the light of an ordinary batswing burner. The light itself is\r\nalso of a more pleasant description, being well supplied with the blue\r\nrays of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe mantle is used with other systems than the ordinary gas-jet.\r\nRecently two methods of illumination have been introduced in which the\r\nsource of illumination is supplied under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe high-pressure incandescent gas installations of Mr. William Sugg\r\nsupply gas to burners at five or six times the ordinary pressure of\r\nthe mains. The effect is to pulverise the gas as it issues from the\r\nnozzle of the burners, and, by rendering it more inflammable, to\r\nincrease its heating power until the surrounding mantle glows with a\r\nvery brilliant and white light of great penetration. Gas is forced\r\nthrough the pipes connected with the lamps by hydraulic rams working\r\ngas-pumps, which alternately suck in and expel the gas under a\r\npressure of twelve inches (_i.e._ a pressure sufficient to maintain a\r\ncolumn of water twelve inches high). The gas under this pressure\r\npasses into a cylinder of a capacity considerably greater than the\r\ncapacity of the pumps. This cylinder neutralises the shock of the\r\nrams, when the stroke changes from up-to downstroke, and _vice versâ_.\r\nOn the top of the cylinder is fixed a governor consisting of a strong\r\nleathern gas-holder, which has a stroke of about three inches, and\r\nactuates a lever which opens and closes the valve through which the\r\nsupply of water to the rams flows, and reduces the flow of the water\r\nwhen it exceeds ten or twelve inches pressure, according to\r\ncircumstances. The gas-holder of the governor is lifted by the\r\npressure of the gas in the cylinder, which passes through a small\r\nopening from the cylinder to the governor so as not to cause any\r\nsudden rise or fall of the gas-holder. By this means a nearly constant\r\npressure is maintained; and from the outlet of the cylinder the gas\r\npasses to another governor sufficient to supply the number of lights\r\nthe apparatus is designed for, and to maintain the pressure without\r\nvariation whether all or a few lamps are in action. For very large\r\ninstallations steam is used.\r\n\r\nEach burner develops 300 candle-power. A double-cylinder steam-engine\r\nworking a double pump supplies 300 of these burners, giving a total\r\nlighting-power of 90,000 candles. As compared with the cost of\r\nlow-pressure incandescent lighting the high-pressure system is very\r\neconomical, being but half as expensive for the same amount of light.\r\n\r\nIt is largely used in factories and railway stations. It may be seen\r\non the Tower Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Euston Station, and in the\r\nterminus of the Great Central Railway, St. John’s Wood.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most formidable rival to the electric arc-lamp for the\r\nlighting of large spaces and buildings is the Kitson Oil Lamp, now so\r\nlargely used in America and this country.\r\n\r\nThe lamp is usually placed on the top of an iron post similar to an\r\nordinary gas-light standard. At the bottom of the post is a chamber\r\ncontaining a steel reservoir capable of holding from five to forty\r\ngallons of petroleum. Above the oil is an air-space into which air has\r\nbeen forced at a pressure of fifty lbs. to the square inch, to act as\r\nan elastic cushion to press the oil into the burners. The oil passes\r\nupwards through an extremely fine tube scarcely thicker than electric\r\nincandescent wires to a pair of cross tubes above the burners. The top\r\none of these acts as a filter to arrest any foreign matter that finds\r\nits way into the oil; the lower one, in diameter about the size of a\r\nlead-pencil and eight inches long, is immediately above the mantles,\r\nthe heat from which vaporises the small quantity of oil in the tube.\r\nThe oil-gas then passes through a tiny hole no larger than a\r\nneedle-point into an open mixing-tube where sufficient air is drawn in\r\nfor supporting combustion. The mixture then travels down to the\r\nmantle, inside which it burns.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious device has lately been added to the system for\r\nfacilitating the lighting of the lamp. At the base of the lamp-post a\r\nsmall hermetically-closed can containing petroleum ether is placed,\r\nand connected by very fine copper-tubing with a burner under the\r\nvaporising tube. When the lamp is to be lit a small rubber bulb is\r\nsqueezed, forcing a quantity of the ether vapour into the burner,\r\nwhere it is ignited by a platinum wire rendered incandescent by a\r\ncurrent passing from a small accumulator also placed in the lamp-post.\r\nThe burner rapidly heats the vaporising tube, and in a few moments\r\noil-gas is passing into the mantles, where it is ignited by the\r\nburner.\r\n\r\nSo economical is the system that a light of 1000 candle-power is\r\nproduced by the combustion of about half-a-pint of petroleum per hour!\r\nComparisons are proverbially odious, but in many cases very\r\ninstructive. Professor V. B. Lewes thus tabulates the results of\r\nexperiments with various illuminants:--\r\n\r\n_Cost of 1000 candles per hour._\r\n\r\n                                               _s. d._\r\n    Electricity  Per unit, 3-1/2d.\r\n         \"       Incandescent,                 1   2\r\n         \"       Arc,                          0   3-3/4\r\n    Coal-gas     Flat flame,                   1   6\r\n         \"       Incandescent,                 0   2-1/4\r\n         \"       \" high pressure,              0   1-3/4\r\n    Oil          Lamp (oil at 8d. per gall.),  0   7-1/4\r\n     \"           Incandescent lamp,            0   2-1/4\r\n     \"           Kitson lamp,                  0   1\r\n\r\nPetroleum, therefore, at present comes in a very good first in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe system that we have noticed at some length has been adapted for\r\nlighthouse use, as it gives a light peculiarly fog-piercing. It is\r\nsaid to approximate most closely to ordinary sunlight, and on that\r\naccount has been found very useful for the taking of photographs at\r\nnight-time. The portability of the apparatus makes it popular with\r\ncontractors; and the fact that its installation requires no tearing up\r\nof the streets is a great recommendation with the long-suffering\r\npublic of some of our large towns.\r\n\r\nAnother very powerful light is produced by burning the gas given off\r\nby carbide of calcium when immersed in water. _Acetylene_ gas, as it\r\nis called, is now widely used in cycle and motor lamps, which emit a\r\nshaft of light sometimes painfully dazzling to those who have to face\r\nit. In Germany the gas is largely employed in village streets; and in\r\nthis country it is gaining ground as an illuminant of country houses,\r\nbeing easy to manufacture--in small gasometers of a few cubic yards\r\ncapacity--and economical to burn.\r\n\r\nWell supplied as we are with lights, we find, nevertheless, that\r\nsavants are constantly in pursuit of an _ideal_ illuminant.\r\n\r\nFrom the sun are borne to us through the ether light waves, heat\r\nwaves, magnetic waves, and other waves of which we have as yet but a\r\ndim perception. The waves are commingled, and we are unable to\r\nseparate them absolutely. And as soon as we try to copy the sun’s\r\neffects as a source of heat or light we find the same difficulty. The\r\nfire that cooks our food gives off a quantity of useless light-waves;\r\nthe oil-lamp that brightens one’s rooms gives off a quantity of\r\nuseless, often obnoxious, heat.\r\n\r\nThe ideal illuminant and the ideal heating agent must be one in which\r\nthe required waves are in a great majority. Unfortunately, even with\r\nour most perfected methods, the production of light is accompanied by\r\nthe exertion of a disproportionate amount of wasted energy. In the\r\nordinary incandescent lamp, to take an instance, only 5 or 6 per cent.\r\nof the energy put into it as electricity results in light. The rest is\r\ndispelled in overcoming the resistance of the filament and agitating\r\nthe few air-molecules in the bulb. To this we must add the fact that\r\nthe current itself represents but a fraction of the power exerted to\r\nproduce it. The following words of Professor Lodge are to the point on\r\nthis subject:--\r\n\r\n“Look at the furnaces and boilers of a steam-engine driving a group of\r\ndynamos, and estimate the energy expended; and then look at the\r\nincandescent filaments of the lamps excited by them, and estimate how\r\nmuch of their radiated energy is of real service to the eye. It will\r\nbe as the energy of a pitch-pipe to an entire orchestra.\r\n\r\n“It is not too much to say that a boy turning a handle could, if his\r\nenergy were properly directed, produce quite as much real light as is\r\nproduced by all this mass of mechanism and consumption of\r\nmaterial.”[6]\r\n\r\n     [6] Professor Oliver Lodge, in a lecture to the Ashmolean\r\n     Society, 3rd June 1889.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect light in nature is probably that of the glow-worm and\r\nfirefly--a phosphorescent or “cold” light, illuminating without\r\ncombustion owing to the absence of all waves but those of the\r\nrequisite frequency. The task before mankind is to imitate the\r\nglow-worm in the production of isolated light-waves.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to its achievement has occurred in the\r\nlaboratories of Mr. Nikola Tesla, the famous electrician. By means of\r\na special oscillator, invented by himself, he has succeeded in\r\nthrowing the ether particles into such an intense state of vibration\r\nthat they become luminous. In other words, he has created vibrations\r\nof the enormous rapidity of light, and this without the creation of\r\nheat waves to any appreciable extent.\r\n\r\nAn incandescent lamp, mounted on a powerful coil, is lit _without_\r\ncontact by ether waves transmitted from a cable running round the\r\nlaboratory, or bulbs and tubes containing highly rarefied gases are\r\nplaced between two large plate-terminals arranged on the end walls. As\r\nsoon as the bulbs are held in the path of the currents passing through\r\nthe ether from plate to plate they become incandescent, shining with a\r\nlight which, though weak, is sufficiently strong to take photographs\r\nby with a long exposure. Tesla has also invented what he calls a\r\n“sanitary” light, as he claims for it the germ-killing properties of\r\nsunshine. The lamps are glass tubes several feet long, bent into\r\nspirals or other convolutions, and filled before sealing with a\r\ncertain gas. The ends of the glass tube are coated with metal and\r\nprovided with hooks to connect the lamp with an electric current. The\r\ngas becomes _luminous_ under the influence of current, but not\r\nstrictly incandescent, as there is very little heat engendered. This\r\nmeans economy in use. The lamps are said to be cheaply manufactured,\r\nbut as yet they are not “on the market.” We shall hear more of them in\r\nthe near future, which will probably witness no more interesting\r\ndevelopment than that of lighting.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter a few words may be said about new heating\r\nmethods. Gas stoves are becoming increasingly popular by reason of the\r\nease with which they can be put in action and made to maintain an even\r\ntemperature. But the most up-to-date heating apparatus is undoubtedly\r\nelectrical. Utensils of all sorts are fitted with very thin heating\r\nstrips (formed by the deposition of precious metals, such as gold,\r\nplatinum, &c., on exceedingly thin mica sheets), through which are\r\npassed powerful currents from the mains. The resistance of the strip\r\nconverts the electromotive energy of the current into heat, which is\r\neither radiated into the air or into water for cookery, &c.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the house the electric current may be made to do work\r\nbesides that of lighting. It warms the passages by means of special\r\nradiators--replacing the clumsy coal and “stuffy” gas stove; in the\r\nkitchen it boils, stews, and fries, heats the flat-irons and ovens; in\r\nthe breakfast room boils the kettle, keeps the dishes, teapots, and\r\ncoffee-pots warm; in the bathroom heats the water; in the smoking-room\r\nreplaces matches; in the bedroom electrifies footwarmers, and--last\r\nwonder of all--even makes possible an artificially warm bed-quilt to\r\nheat the chilled limbs of invalids!\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of electric heating is the freedom from all smell\r\nand smoke that accompanies it. But until current can be provided at\r\ncheaper rates than prevail at present, its employment will be chiefly\r\nrestricted to the houses of the wealthy or to large establishments,\r\nsuch as hotels, where it can be used on a sufficient scale to be\r\ncomparatively economical.\r\n\r\n                               THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n    Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\n    Edinburgh & London\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Romance of Modern Invention\r\n\r\n\r\n  _BY THE SAME AUTHOR_\r\n\r\n  _Uniform with this Volume_\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ROMANCE OF MODERN ENGINEERING\r\n\r\n       Containing Interesting Descriptions in Non-Technical Language\r\n       of the Nile Dam, the Panama Canal, the Tower Bridge, the\r\n       Brooklyn Bridge, the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Niagara Falls\r\n       Power Co., Bermuda Floating Dock, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n  “A series of descriptions which rival one another in\r\n  lucidity of explanation and in interest, both of subject and\r\n  treatment.”--_Manchester Courier._\r\n\r\n  “Men of any age will be interested in this volume;\r\n  boys will be fascinated by it.”--_Spectator._\r\n\r\n  “If there lives a boy who is fond of engineering and\r\n  speaks the English tongue, this is the book for him.”--_The\r\n  Bookman._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _With 24 Illustrations.
