But round wooden shoes, shaped like bowls, are not\r\ncomfortable wear, however much it may amuse the onlooker to see you try\r\nto walk in them. If you have a nice fur coat like a company promoter's,\r\nit is most annoying to be made to swim in it. And if you had a tail,\r\nsurely it would be solely your own affair; that any one should tie a tin\r\ncan to it would strike you as an unwarrantable impertinence--to say the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nYet it is difficult for an outsider to see these things from the point\r\nof view of both the persons concerned. To Maurice, scissors in hand,\r\nalive and earnest to snip, it seemed the most natural thing in the world\r\nto shorten the stiff whiskers of Lord Hugh Cecil by a generous inch. He\r\ndid not understand how useful those whiskers were to Lord Hugh, both in\r\nsport and in the more serious business of getting a living. Also it\r\namused Maurice to throw Lord Hugh into ponds, though Lord Hugh only\r\nonce permitted this liberty. To put walnuts on Lord Hugh's feet and then\r\nto watch him walk on ice was, in Maurice's opinion, as good as a play.\r\nLord Hugh was a very favourite cat, but Maurice was discreet, and Lord\r\nHugh, except under violent suffering, was at that time anyhow, dumb.\r\n\r\nBut the empty sardine-tin attached to Lord Hugh's tail and hind\r\nlegs--this had a voice, and, rattling against stairs, banisters, and the\r\nlegs of stricken furniture, it cried aloud for vengeance. Lord Hugh,\r\nsuffering violently, added his voice, and this time the family heard.\r\nThere was a chase, a chorus of 'Poor pussy!' and 'Pussy, then!' and the\r\ntail and the tin and Lord Hugh were caught under Jane's bed. The tail\r\nand the tin acquiesced in their rescue. Lord Hugh did not. He fought,\r\nscratched, and bit. Jane carried the scars of that rescue for many a\r\nlong week.\r\n\r\nWhen all was calm Maurice was sought and, after some little natural\r\ndelay, found--in the boot-cupboard.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Maurice!' his mother almost sobbed, 'how _can_ you? What will your\r\nfather say?'\r\n\r\nMaurice thought he knew what his father would do.\r\n\r\n'Don't you know,' the mother went on, 'how wrong it is to be cruel?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean to be cruel,' Maurice said. And, what is more, he spoke\r\nthe truth. All the unwelcome attentions he had showered on Lord Hugh had\r\nnot been exactly intended to hurt that stout veteran--only it was\r\ninteresting to see what a cat would do if you threw it in the water, or\r\ncut its whiskers, or tied things to its tail.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but you must have meant to be cruel,' said mother, 'and you will\r\nhave to be punished.'\r\n\r\n'I wish I hadn't,' said Maurice, from the heart.\r\n\r\n'So do I,' said his mother, with a sigh; 'but it isn't the first time;\r\nyou know you tied Lord Hugh up in a bag with the hedgehog only last\r\nTuesday week. You'd better go to your room and think it over. I shall\r\nhave to tell your father directly he comes home.'\r\n\r\nMaurice went to his room and thought it over. And the more he thought\r\nthe more he hated Lord Hugh. Why couldn't the beastly cat have held his\r\ntongue and sat still? That, at the time would have been a\r\ndisappointment, but now Maurice wished it had happened. He sat on the\r\nedge of his bed and savagely kicked the edge of the green Kidderminster\r\ncarpet, and hated the cat.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't meant to be cruel; he was sure he hadn't; he wouldn't have\r\npinched the cat's feet or squeezed its tail in the door, or pulled its\r\nwhiskers, or poured hot water on it. He felt himself ill-used, and knew\r\nthat he would feel still more so after the inevitable interview with his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nBut that interview did not take the immediately painful form expected by\r\nMaurice. His father did _not_ say, 'Now I will show you what it feels\r\nlike to be hurt.' Maurice had braced himself for that, and was looking\r\nbeyond it to the calm of forgiveness which should follow the storm in\r\nwhich he should so unwillingly take part. No; his father was already\r\ncalm and reasonable--with a dreadful calm, a terrifying reason.\r\n\r\n'Look here, my boy,' he said. 'This cruelty to dumb animals must be\r\nchecked--severely checked.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean to be cruel,' said Maurice.\r\n\r\n'Evil,' said Mr. Basingstoke, for such was Maurice's surname, 'is\r\nwrought by want of thought as well as want of heart. What about your\r\nputting the hen in the oven?'\r\n\r\n'You know,' said Maurice, pale but determined, 'you _know_ I only wanted\r\nto help her to get her eggs hatched quickly. It says in \"Fowls for Food\r\nand Fancy\" that heat hatches eggs.'\r\n\r\n'But she hadn't any eggs,' said Mr. Basingstoke.\r\n\r\n'But she soon would have,' urged Maurice. 'I thought a stitch in\r\ntime----'\r\n\r\n'That,' said his father, 'is the sort of thing that you must learn not\r\nto think.'\r\n\r\n'I'll try,' said Maurice, miserably hoping for the best.\r\n\r\n'I intend that you shall,' said Mr. Basingstoke. 'This afternoon you go\r\nto Dr. Strongitharm's for the remaining week of term. If I find any more\r\ncruelty taking place during the holidays you will go there permanently.\r\nYou can go and get ready.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, father, _please_ not,' was all Maurice found to say.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, my boy,' said his father, much more kindly; 'it's all for\r\nyour own good, and it's as painful to me as it is to you--remember that.\r\nThe cab will be here at four. Go and put your things together, and Jane\r\nshall pack for you.'\r\n\r\nSo the box was packed. Mabel, Maurice's kiddy sister, cried over\r\neverything as it was put in. It was a very wet day.\r\n\r\n'If it had been any school but old Strong's,' she sobbed.\r\n\r\nShe and her brother knew that school well: its windows, dulled with wire\r\nblinds, its big alarm bell, the high walls of its grounds, bristling\r\nwith spikes, the iron gates, always locked, through which gloomy boys,\r\nimprisoned, scowled on a free world. Dr. Strongitharm's was a school\r\n'for backward and difficult boys.' Need I say more?\r\n\r\nWell, there was no help for it. The box was packed, the cab was at the\r\ndoor. The farewells had been said. Maurice determined that he wouldn't\r\ncry and he didn't, which gave him the one touch of pride and joy that\r\nsuch a scene could yield. Then at the last moment, just as father had\r\none leg in the cab, the Taxes called. Father went back into the house to\r\nwrite a cheque. Mother and Mabel had retired in tears. Maurice used the\r\nreprieve to go back after his postage-stamp album. Already he was\r\nplanning how to impress the other boys at old Strong's, and his was\r\nreally a very fair collection. He ran up into the schoolroom, expecting\r\nto find it empty. But some one was there: Lord Hugh, in the very middle\r\nof the ink-stained table-cloth.\r\n\r\n'You brute,' said Maurice; 'you know jolly well I'm going away, or you\r\nwouldn't be here.' And, indeed, the room had never, somehow, been a\r\nfavourite of Lord Hugh's.\r\n\r\n'Meaow,' said Lord Hugh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'If you think cats have such a jolly time,' said Lord\r\nHugh, 'why not _be_ a cat?']\r\n\r\n'Mew!' said Maurice, with scorn. 'That's what you always say. All that\r\nfuss about a jolly little sardine-tin. Any one would have thought you'd\r\nbe only too glad to have it to play with. I wonder how you'd like being\r\na boy? Lickings, and lessons, and impots, and sent back from breakfast\r\nto wash your ears. You wash yours anywhere--I wonder what they'd say to\r\nme if I washed my ears on the drawing-room hearthrug?'\r\n\r\n'Meaow,' said Lord Hugh, and washed an ear, as though he were showing\r\noff.\r\n\r\n'Mew,' said Maurice again; 'that's all you can say.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, it isn't,' said Lord Hugh, and stopped his ear-washing.\r\n\r\n'I say!' said Maurice in awestruck tones.\r\n\r\n'If you think cats have such a jolly time,' said Lord Hugh, 'why not\r\n_be_ a cat?'\r\n\r\n'I would if I could,' said Maurice, 'and fight you----'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Lord Hugh.\r\n\r\n'But I can't,' said Maurice.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, you can,' said Lord Hugh. 'You've only got to say the word.'\r\n\r\n'What word?'\r\n\r\nLord Hugh told him the word; but I will not tell you, for fear you\r\nshould say it by accident and then be sorry.\r\n\r\n'And if I say that, I shall turn into a cat?'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said the cat.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, I see,' said Maurice. 'But I'm not taking any, thanks. I don't\r\nwant to be a cat for always.'\r\n\r\n'You needn't,' said Lord Hugh. 'You've only got to get some one to say\r\nto you, \"Please leave off being a cat and be Maurice again,\" and there\r\nyou are.'\r\n\r\nMaurice thought of Dr. Strongitharm's. He also thought of the horror of\r\nhis father when he should find Maurice gone, vanished, not to be traced.\r\n'He'll be sorry, then,' Maurice told himself, and to the cat he said,\r\nsuddenly:--\r\n\r\n'Right--I'll do it. What's the word, again?'\r\n\r\n'----,' said the cat.\r\n\r\n'----,' said Maurice; and suddenly the table shot up to the height of a\r\nhouse, the walls to the height of tenement buildings, the pattern on the\r\ncarpet became enormous, and Maurice found himself on all fours. He tried\r\nto stand up on his feet, but his shoulders were oddly heavy. He could\r\nonly rear himself upright for a moment, and then fell heavily on his\r\nhands. He looked down at them; they seemed to have grown shorter and\r\nfatter, and were encased in black fur gloves. He felt a desire to walk\r\non all fours--tried it--did it. It was very odd--the movement of the\r\narms straight from the shoulder, more like the movement of the piston of\r\nan engine than anything Maurice could think of at that moment.\r\n\r\n'I am asleep,' said Maurice--'I am dreaming this. I am dreaming I am a\r\ncat. I hope I dreamed that about the sardine-tin and Lord Hugh's tail,\r\nand Dr. Strong's.'\r\n\r\n'You didn't,' said a voice he knew and yet didn't know, 'and you aren't\r\ndreaming this.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am,' said Maurice; 'and now I'm going to dream that I fight that\r\nbeastly black cat, and give him the best licking he ever had in his\r\nlife. Come on, Lord Hugh.'\r\n\r\nA loud laugh answered him.\r\n\r\n'Excuse my smiling,' said the voice he knew and didn't know, 'but don't\r\nyou see--you _are_ Lord Hugh!'\r\n\r\nA great hand picked Maurice up from the floor and held him in the air.\r\nHe felt the position to be not only undignified but unsafe, and gave\r\nhimself a shake of mingled relief and resentment when the hand set him\r\ndown on the inky table-cloth.\r\n\r\n'You are Lord Hugh now, my dear Maurice,' said the voice, and a huge\r\nface came quite close to his. It was his own face, as it would have\r\nseemed through a magnifying glass. And the voice--oh, horror!--the\r\nvoice was his own voice--Maurice Basingstoke's voice. Maurice shrank\r\nfrom the voice, and he would have liked to claw the face, but he had had\r\nno practice.\r\n\r\n'You are Lord Hugh,' the voice repeated, 'and I am Maurice. I like being\r\nMaurice. I am so large and strong. I could drown you in the water-butt,\r\nmy poor cat--oh, so easily. No, don't spit and swear. It's bad\r\nmanners--even in a cat.'\r\n\r\n'Maurice!' shouted Mr. Basingstoke from between the door and the cab.\r\n\r\nMaurice, from habit, leaped towards the door.\r\n\r\n'It's no use _your_ going,' said the thing that looked like a giant\r\nreflection of Maurice; 'it's _me_ he wants.'\r\n\r\n'But I didn't agree to your being me.'\r\n\r\n'That's poetry, even if it isn't grammar,' said the thing that looked\r\nlike Maurice. 'Why, my good cat, don't you see that if you are I, I must\r\nbe you? Otherwise we should interfere with time and space, upset the\r\nbalance of power, and as likely as not destroy the solar system. Oh,\r\nyes--I'm you, right enough, and shall be, till some one tells you to\r\nchange from Lord Hugh into Maurice. And now you've got to find some one\r\nto do it.'\r\n\r\n('Maurice!' thundered the voice of Mr. Basingstoke.)\r\n\r\n'That'll be easy enough,' said Maurice.\r\n\r\n'Think so?' said the other.\r\n\r\n'But I sha'n't try yet. I want to have some fun first. I shall catch\r\nheaps of mice!'\r\n\r\n'Think so? You forget that your whiskers are cut off--Maurice cut them.\r\nWithout whiskers, how can you judge of the width of the places you go\r\nthrough? Take care you don't get stuck in a hole that you can't get out\r\nof or go in through, my good cat.'\r\n\r\n'Don't call me a cat,' said Maurice, and felt that his tail was growing\r\nthick and angry.\r\n\r\n'You _are_ a cat, you know--and that little bit of temper that I see in\r\nyour tail reminds me----'\r\n\r\nMaurice felt himself gripped round the middle, abruptly lifted, and\r\ncarried swiftly through the air. The quickness of the movement made him\r\ngiddy. The light went so quickly past him that it might as well have\r\nbeen darkness. He saw nothing, felt nothing, except a sort of long\r\nsea-sickness, and then suddenly he was not being moved. He could see\r\nnow. He could feel. He was being held tight in a sort of vice--a vice\r\ncovered with chequered cloth. It looked like the pattern, very much\r\nexaggerated, of his school knickerbockers. It _was_. He was being held\r\nbetween the hard, relentless knees of that creature that had once been\r\nLord Hugh, and to whose tail he had tied a sardine-tin. Now _he_ was\r\nLord Hugh, and something was being tied to _his_ tail. Something\r\nmysterious, terrible. Very well, he would show that he was not afraid of\r\nanything that could be attached to tails. The string rubbed his fur the\r\nwrong way--it was that that annoyed him, not the string itself; and as\r\nfor what was at the end of the string, what _could_ that matter to any\r\nsensible cat? Maurice was quite decided that he was--and would keep on\r\nbeing--a sensible cat.\r\n\r\nThe string, however, and the uncomfortable, tight position between those\r\nchequered knees--something or other was getting on his nerves.\r\n\r\n'Maurice!' shouted his father below, and the be-catted Maurice bounded\r\nbetween the knees of the creature that wore his clothes and his looks.\r\n\r\n'Coming, father,' this thing called, and sped away, leaving Maurice on\r\nthe servant's bed--under which Lord Hugh had taken refuge, with his\r\ntin-can, so short and yet so long a time ago. The stairs re-echoed to\r\nthe loud boots which Maurice had never before thought loud; he had\r\noften, indeed, wondered that any one could object to them. He wondered\r\nnow no longer.\r\n\r\nHe heard the front door slam. That thing had gone to Dr.\r\nStrongitharm's. That was one comfort. Lord Hugh was a boy now; he would\r\nknow what it was to be a boy. He, Maurice, was a cat, and he meant to\r\ntaste fully all catty pleasures, from milk to mice. Meanwhile he was\r\nwithout mice or milk, and, unaccustomed as he was to a tail, he could\r\nnot but feel that all was not right with his own. There was a feeling of\r\nweight, a feeling of discomfort, of positive terror. If he should move,\r\nwhat would that thing that was tied to his tail do? Rattle, of course.\r\nOh, but he could not bear it if that thing rattled. Nonsense; it was\r\nonly a sardine-tin. Yes, Maurice knew that. But all the same--if it did\r\nrattle! He moved his tail the least little soft inch. No sound. Perhaps\r\nreally there wasn't anything tied to his tail. But he couldn't be sure\r\nunless he moved. But if he moved the thing would rattle, and if it\r\nrattled Maurice felt sure that he would expire or go mad. A mad cat.\r\nWhat a dreadful thing to be! Yet he couldn't sit on that bed for ever,\r\nwaiting, waiting, waiting for the dreadful thing to happen.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dear,' sighed Maurice the cat. 'I never knew what people meant by\r\n\"afraid\" before.'\r\n\r\nHis cat-heart was beating heavily against his furry side. His limbs were\r\ngetting cramped--he must move. He did. And instantly the awful thing\r\nhappened. The sardine-tin touched the iron of the bed-foot. It rattled.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I can't bear it, I can't,' cried poor Maurice, in a heartrending\r\nmeaow that echoed through the house. He leaped from the bed and tore\r\nthrough the door and down the stairs, and behind him came the most\r\nterrible thing in the world. People might call it a sardine-tin, but he\r\nknew better. It was the soul of all the fear that ever had been or ever\r\ncould be. _It rattled._\r\n\r\nMaurice who was a cat flew down the stairs; down, down--the rattling\r\nhorror followed. Oh, horrible! Down, down! At the foot of the stairs the\r\nhorror, caught by something--a banister--a stair-rod--stopped. The\r\nstring on Maurice's tail tightened, his tail was jerked, he was stopped.\r\nBut the noise had stopped too. Maurice lay only just alive at the foot\r\nof the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was Mabel who untied the string and soothed his terrors with\r\nstrokings and tender love-words. Maurice was surprised to find what a\r\nnice little girl his sister really was.\r\n\r\n'I'll never tease you again,' he tried to say, softly--but that was not\r\nwhat he said. What he said was 'Purrrr.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was Mabel who untied the string and soothed his\r\nterrors.]\r\n\r\n'Dear pussy, nice poor pussy, then,' said Mabel, and she hid away the\r\nsardine-tin and did not tell any one. This seemed unjust to Maurice\r\nuntil he remembered that, of course, Mabel thought that he was really\r\nLord Hugh, and that the person who had tied the tin to his tail was her\r\nbrother Maurice. Then he was half grateful. She carried him down, in\r\nsoft, safe arms, to the kitchen, and asked cook to give him some milk.\r\n\r\n'Tell me to change back into Maurice,' said Maurice who was quite worn\r\nout by his cattish experiences. But no one heard him. What they heard\r\nwas, 'Meaow--Meaow--Meeeaow!'\r\n\r\nThen Maurice saw how he had been tricked. He could be changed back into\r\na boy as soon as any one said to him, 'Leave off being a cat and be\r\nMaurice again,' but his tongue had no longer the power to ask any one to\r\nsay it.\r\n\r\nHe did not sleep well that night. For one thing he was not accustomed to\r\nsleeping on the kitchen hearthrug, and the blackbeetles were too many\r\nand too cordial. He was glad when cook came down and turned him out into\r\nthe garden, where the October frost still lay white on the yellowed\r\nstalks of sunflowers and nasturtiums. He took a walk, climbed a tree,\r\nfailed to catch a bird, and felt better. He began also to feel hungry.\r\nA delicious scent came stealing out of the back kitchen door. Oh, joy,\r\nthere were to be herrings for breakfast! Maurice hastened in and took\r\nhis place on his usual chair.\r\n\r\nHis mother said, 'Down, puss,' and gently tilted the chair so that\r\nMaurice fell off it. Then the family had herrings. Maurice said, 'You\r\nmight give me some,' and he said it so often that his father, who, of\r\ncourse, heard only mewings, said:--\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake put that cat out of the room.'\r\n\r\nMaurice breakfasted later, in the dust-bin, on herring heads.\r\n\r\nBut he kept himself up with a new and splendid idea. They would give him\r\nmilk presently, and then they should see.\r\n\r\nHe spent the afternoon sitting on the sofa in the dining-room, listening\r\nto the conversation of his father and mother. It is said that listeners\r\nnever hear any good of themselves. Maurice heard so much that he was\r\nsurprised and humbled. He heard his father say that he was a fine,\r\nplucky little chap, but he needed a severe lesson, and Dr. Strongitharm\r\nwas the man to give it to him. He heard his mother say things that made\r\nhis heart throb in his throat and the tears prick behind those green\r\ncat-eyes of his. He had always thought his parents a little bit unjust.\r\nNow they did him so much more than justice that he felt quite small and\r\nmean inside his cat-skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He landed there on his four padded feet light as a\r\nfeather.]\r\n\r\n'He's a dear, good, affectionate boy,' said mother. 'It's only his high\r\nspirits. Don't you think, darling, perhaps you were a little hard on\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n'It was for his own good,' said father.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said mother; 'but I can't bear to think of him at that\r\ndreadful school.'\r\n\r\n'Well----,' father was beginning, when Jane came in with the tea-things\r\non a clattering tray, whose sound made Maurice tremble in every leg.\r\nFather and mother began to talk about the weather.\r\n\r\nMaurice felt very affectionately to both his parents. The natural way of\r\nshowing this was to jump on to the sideboard and thence on to his\r\nfather's shoulders. He landed there on his four padded feet, light as a\r\nfeather, but father was not pleased.\r\n\r\n'Bother the cat!' he cried. 'Jane, put it out of the room.'\r\n\r\nMaurice was put out. His great idea, which was to be carried out with\r\nmilk, would certainly not be carried out in the dining-room. He sought\r\nthe kitchen, and, seeing a milk-can on the window-ledge, jumped up\r\nbeside the can and patted it as he had seen Lord Hugh do.\r\n\r\n'My!' said a friend of Jane's who happened to be there, 'ain't that cat\r\nclever--a perfect moral, I call her.'\r\n\r\n'He's nothing to boast of this time,' said cook. 'I will say for Lord\r\nHugh he's not often taken in with a empty can.'\r\n\r\nThis was naturally mortifying for Maurice, but he pretended not to hear,\r\nand jumped from the window to the tea-table and patted the milk-jug.\r\n\r\n'Come,' said the cook, 'that's more like it,' and she poured him out a\r\nfull saucer and set it on the floor.\r\n\r\nNow was the chance Maurice had longed for. Now he could carry out that\r\nidea of his. He was very thirsty, for he had had nothing since that\r\ndelicious breakfast in the dust-bin. But not for worlds would he have\r\ndrunk the milk. No. He carefully dipped his right paw in it, for his\r\nidea was to make letters with it on the kitchen oil-cloth. He meant to\r\nwrite: 'Please tell me to leave off being a cat and be Maurice again,'\r\nbut he found his paw a very clumsy pen, and he had to rub out the first\r\n'P' because it only looked like an accident. Then he tried again and\r\nactually did make a 'P' that any fair-minded person could have read\r\nquite easily.\r\n\r\n'I wish they'd notice,' he said, and before he got the 'l' written they\r\ndid notice.\r\n\r\n'Drat the cat,' said cook; 'look how he's messing the floor up.'\r\n\r\nAnd she took away the milk.\r\n\r\nMaurice put pride aside and mewed to have the milk put down again. But\r\nhe did not get it.\r\n\r\nVery weary, very thirsty, and very tired of being Lord Hugh, he\r\npresently found his way to the schoolroom, where Mabel with patient toil\r\nwas doing her home-lessons. She took him on her lap and stroked him\r\nwhile she learned her French verb. He felt that he was growing very fond\r\nof her. People were quite right to be kind to dumb animals. Presently\r\nshe had to stop stroking him and do a map. And after that she kissed him\r\nand put him down and went away. All the time she had been doing the map,\r\nMaurice had had but one thought: _Ink!_\r\n\r\nThe moment the door had closed behind her--how sensible people were who\r\nclosed doors gently--he stood up in her chair with one paw on the map\r\nand the other on the ink. Unfortunately, the inkstand top was made to\r\ndip pens in, and not to dip paws. But Maurice was desperate. He\r\ndeliberately upset the ink--most of it rolled over the table-cloth and\r\nfell pattering on the carpet, but with what was left he wrote quite\r\nplainly, across the map:--\r\n\r\n   'Please tell Lord Hugh\r\n    to stop being\r\n    a cat and be Mau\r\n    rice again.'\r\n\r\n'There!' he said; 'they can't make any mistake about that.' They didn't.\r\nBut they made a mistake about who had done it, and Mabel was deprived of\r\njam with her supper bread.\r\n\r\nHer assurance that some naughty boy must have come through the window\r\nand done it while she was not there convinced nobody, and, indeed, the\r\nwindow was shut and bolted.\r\n\r\nMaurice, wild with indignation, did not mend matters by seizing the\r\nopportunity of a few minutes' solitude to write:--\r\n\r\n   'It was not Mabel\r\n    it was Maur\r\n    ice I mean Lord Hugh,'\r\n\r\nbecause when that was seen Mabel was instantly sent to bed.\r\n\r\n'It's not fair!' cried Maurice.\r\n\r\n'My dear,' said Maurice's father, 'if that cat goes on mewing to this\r\nextent you'll have to get rid of it.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: When Jane went in to put Mabel's light out Maurice crept\r\nin too.]\r\n\r\nMaurice said not another word. It was bad enough to be a cat, but to be\r\na cat that was 'got rid of'! He knew how people got rid of cats. In a\r\nstricken silence he left the room and slunk up the stairs--he dared not\r\nmew again, even at the door of Mabel's room. But when Jane went in to\r\nput Mabel's light out Maurice crept in too, and in the dark tried with\r\nstifled mews and purrs to explain to Mabel how sorry he was. Mabel\r\nstroked him and he went to sleep, his last waking thought amazement at\r\nthe blindness that had once made him call her a silly little kid.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever been a cat you will understand something of what\r\nMaurice endured during the dreadful days that followed. If you have not,\r\nI can never make you understand fully. There was the affair of the\r\nfishmonger's tray balanced on the wall by the back door--the delicious\r\ncurled-up whiting; Maurice knew as well as you do that one mustn't steal\r\nfish out of other people's trays, but the cat that he was didn't know.\r\nThere was an inward struggle--and Maurice was beaten by the cat-nature.\r\nLater he was beaten by the cook.\r\n\r\nThen there was that very painful incident with the butcher's dog, the\r\nflight across gardens, the safety of the plum tree gained only just in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd, worst of all, despair took hold of him, for he saw that nothing he\r\ncould do would make any one say those simple words that would release\r\nhim. He had hoped that Mabel might at last be made to understand, but\r\nthe ink had failed him; she did not understand his subdued mewings, and\r\nwhen he got the cardboard letters and made the same sentence with them\r\nMabel only thought it was that naughty boy who came through locked\r\nwindows. Somehow he could not spell before any one--his nerves were not\r\nwhat they had been. His brain now gave him no new ideas. He felt that he\r\nwas really growing like a cat in his mind. His interest in his meals\r\ngrew beyond even what it had been when they were a schoolboy's meals. He\r\nhunted mice with growing enthusiasm, though the loss of his whiskers to\r\nmeasure narrow places with made hunting difficult.\r\n\r\nHe grew expert in bird-stalking, and often got quite near to a bird\r\nbefore it flew away, laughing at him. But all the time, in his heart, he\r\nwas very, very miserable. And so the week went by.\r\n\r\nMaurice in his cat shape dreaded more and more the time when Lord Hugh\r\nin the boy shape should come back from Dr. Strongitharm's. He knew--who\r\nbetter?--exactly the kind of things boys do to cats, and he trembled to\r\nthe end of his handsome half-Persian tail.\r\n\r\nAnd then the boy came home from Dr. Strongitharm's, and at the first\r\nsound of his boots in the hall Maurice in the cat's body fled with\r\nsilent haste to hide in the boot-cupboard.\r\n\r\nHere, ten minutes later, the boy that had come back from Dr.\r\nStrongitharm's found him.\r\n\r\nMaurice fluffed up his tail and unsheathed his claws. Whatever this boy\r\nwas going to do to him Maurice meant to resist, and his resistance\r\nshould hurt the boy as much as possible. I am sorry to say Maurice swore\r\nsoftly among the boots, but cat-swearing is not really wrong.\r\n\r\n'Come out, you old duffer,' said Lord Hugh in the boy shape of Maurice.\r\n'I'm not going to hurt you.'\r\n\r\n'I'll see to that,' said Maurice, backing into the corner, all teeth and\r\nclaws.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've had such a time!' said Lord Hugh. 'It's no use, you know, old\r\nchap; I can see where you are by your green eyes. My word, they do\r\nshine. I've been caned and shut up in a dark room and given thousands of\r\nlines to write out.'\r\n\r\n'I've been beaten, too, if you come to that,' mewed Maurice. 'Besides\r\nthe butcher's dog.'\r\n\r\nIt was an intense relief to speak to some one who could understand his\r\nmews.\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose it's Pax for the future,' said Lord Hugh; 'if you\r\nwon't come out, you won't. Please leave off being a cat and be Maurice\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nAnd instantly Maurice, amid a heap of goloshes and old tennis bats, felt\r\nwith a swelling heart that he was no longer a cat. No more of those\r\nundignified four legs, those tiresome pointed ears, so difficult to\r\nwash, that furry coat, that contemptible tail, and that terrible\r\ninability to express all one's feelings in two words--'mew' and 'purr.'\r\n\r\nHe scrambled out of the cupboard, and the boots and goloshes fell off\r\nhim like spray off a bather.\r\n\r\nHe stood upright in those very chequered knickerbockers that were so\r\nterrible when their knees held one vice-like, while things were tied to\r\none's tail. He was face to face with another boy, exactly like himself.\r\n\r\n'_You_ haven't changed, then--but there can't be two Maurices.'\r\n\r\n'There sha'n't be; not if I know it,' said the other boy; 'a boy's\r\nlife's a dog's life. Quick, before any one comes.'\r\n\r\n'Quick what?' asked Maurice.\r\n\r\n'Why tell me to leave off being a boy, and to be Lord Hugh Cecil again.'\r\n\r\nMaurice told him at once. And at once the boy was gone, and there was\r\nLord Hugh in his own shape, purring politely, yet with a watchful eye\r\non Maurice's movements.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you needn't be afraid, old chap. It's Pax right enough,' Maurice\r\nmurmured in the ear of Lord Hugh. And Lord Hugh, arching his back under\r\nMaurice's stroking hand, replied with a purrrr-meaow that spoke volumes.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Maurice, here you are. It _is_ nice of you to be nice to Lord Hugh,\r\nwhen it was because of him you----'\r\n\r\n'He's a good old chap,' said Maurice, carelessly. 'And you're not half a\r\nbad old girl. See?'\r\n\r\nMabel almost wept for joy at this magnificent compliment, and Lord Hugh\r\nhimself took on a more happy and confident air.\r\n\r\nPlease dismiss any fears which you may entertain that after this Maurice\r\nbecame a model boy. He didn't. But he was much nicer than before. The\r\nconversation which he overheard when he was a cat makes him more patient\r\nwith his father and mother. And he is almost always nice to Mabel, for\r\nhe cannot forget all that she was to him when he wore the shape of Lord\r\nHugh. His father attributes all the improvement in his son's character\r\nto that week at Dr. Strongitharm's--which, as you know, Maurice never\r\nhad. Lord Hugh's character is unchanged. Cats learn slowly and with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nOnly Maurice and Lord Hugh know the truth--Maurice has never told it to\r\nany one except me, and Lord Hugh is a very reserved cat. He never at\r\nany time had that free flow of mew which distinguished and endangered\r\nthe cat-hood of Maurice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE MIXED MINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship was first sighted off Dungeness. She was labouring heavily. Her\r\npaint was peculiar and her rig outlandish. She looked like a golden ship\r\nout of a painted picture.\r\n\r\n'Blessed if I ever see such a rig--nor such lines neither,' old\r\nHawkhurst said.\r\n\r\nIt was a late afternoon, wild and grey. Slate-coloured clouds drove\r\nacross the sky like flocks of hurried camels. The waves were purple and\r\nblue, and in the west a streak of unnatural-looking green light was all\r\nthat stood for the splendours of sunset.\r\n\r\n'She do be a rum 'un,' said young Benenden, who had strolled along the\r\nbeach with the glasses the gentleman gave him for saving the little boy\r\nfrom drowning. 'Don't know as I ever see another just like her.'\r\n\r\n'I'd give half a dollar to any chap as can tell me where she hails\r\nfrom--and what port it is where they has ships o' that cut,' said\r\nmiddle-aged Haversham to the group that had now gathered.\r\n\r\n'George!' exclaimed young Benenden from under his field-glasses, 'she's\r\ngoing.' And she went. Her bow went down suddenly and she stood stern up\r\nin the water--like a duck after rain. Then quite slowly, with no\r\nunseemly hurry, but with no moment's change of what seemed to be her\r\nfixed purpose, the ship sank and the grey rolling waves wiped out the\r\nplace where she had been.\r\n\r\nNow I hope you will not expect me to tell you anything more about this\r\nship--because there is nothing more to tell. What country she came from,\r\nwhat port she was bound for, what cargo she carried, and what kind of\r\ntongue her crew spoke--all these things are dead secrets. And a dead\r\nsecret is a secret that nobody knows. No other secrets are dead secrets.\r\nEven I do not know this one, or I would tell you at once. For I, at\r\nleast, have no secrets from you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Her bow went down suddenly.]\r\n\r\nWhen ships go down off Dungeness, things from them have a way of being\r\nwashed up on the sands of that bay which curves from Dungeness to\r\nFolkestone, where the sea has bitten a piece out of the land--just such\r\na half-moon-shaped piece as you bite out of a slice of bread-and-butter.\r\nBits of wood tangled with ropes--broken furniture--ships' biscuits in\r\nbarrels and kegs that have held brandy--seamen's chests--and sometimes\r\nsadder things that we will not talk about just now.\r\n\r\nNow, if you live by the sea and are grown-up you know that if you find\r\nanything on the seashore (I don't mean starfish or razor-shells or\r\njellyfish and sea-mice, but anything out of a ship that you would really\r\nlike to keep) your duty is to take it up to the coast-guard and say,\r\n'Please, I've found this.' Then the coast-guard will send it to the\r\nproper authority, and one of these days you'll get a reward of one-third\r\nof the value of whatever it was that you picked up. But two-thirds of\r\nthe value of anything, or even three-thirds of its value, is not at all\r\nthe same thing as the thing itself--if it happened to be the kind of\r\nthing you want. But if you are not grown-up and do not live by the sea,\r\nbut in a nice little villa in a nice little suburb, where all the\r\nfurniture is new and the servants wear white aprons and white caps with\r\nlong strings in the afternoon, then you won't know anything about your\r\nduty, and if you find anything by the sea you'll think that findings are\r\nkeepings.\r\n\r\nEdward was not grown-up--and he kept everything he found, including\r\nsea-mice, till the landlady of the lodgings where his aunt was threw his\r\ncollection into the pig-pail.\r\n\r\nBeing a quiet and persevering little boy he did not cry or complain,\r\nbut having meekly followed his treasures to their long home--the pig\r\nwas six feet from nose to tail, and ate the dead sea-mouse as easily\r\nand happily as your father eats an oyster--he started out to make a new\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nAnd the first thing he found was an oyster-shell that was pink and green\r\nand blue inside, and the second was an old boot--very old indeed--and\r\nthe third was _it_.\r\n\r\nIt was a square case of old leather embossed with odd little figures of\r\nmen and animals and words that Edward could not read. It was oblong and\r\nhad no key, but a sort of leather hasp, and was curiously knotted with\r\nstring--rather like a boot-lace. And Edward opened it. There were\r\nseveral things inside: queer-looking instruments, some rather like those\r\nin the little box of mathematical instruments that he had had as a prize\r\nat school, and some like nothing he had ever seen before. And in a deep\r\ngroove of the russet soaked velvet lining lay a neat little brass\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nT-squares and set-squares and so forth are of little use on a sandy\r\nshore. But you can always look through a telescope.\r\n\r\nEdward picked it out and put it to his eye, and tried to see through it\r\na little tug that was sturdily puffing up Channel. He failed to find the\r\ntug, and found himself gazing at a little cloud on the horizon. As he\r\nlooked it grew larger and darker, and presently a spot of rain fell on\r\nhis nose. He rubbed it off--on his jersey sleeve, I am sorry to say, and\r\nnot on his handkerchief. Then he looked through the glass again; but he\r\nfound he needed both hands to keep it steady, so he set down the box\r\nwith the other instruments on the sand at his feet and put the glass to\r\nhis eye again.\r\n\r\nHe never saw the box again. For in his unpractised efforts to cover the\r\ntug with his glass he found himself looking at the shore instead of at\r\nthe sea, and the shore looked so odd that he could not make up his mind\r\nto stop looking at it.\r\n\r\nHe had thought it was a sandy shore, but almost at once he saw that it\r\nwas not sand but fine shingle, and the discovery of this mistake\r\nsurprised him so much that he kept on looking at the shingle through the\r\nlittle telescope, which showed it quite plainly. And as he looked the\r\nshingle grew coarser; it was stones now--quite decent-sized stones,\r\nlarge stones, enormous stones.\r\n\r\nSomething hard pressed against his foot, and he lowered the glass.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by big stones, and they all seemed to be moving; some\r\nwere tumbling off others that lay in heaps below them, and others were\r\nrolling away from the beach in every direction. And the place where he\r\nhad put down the box was covered with great stones which he could not\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nEdward was very much upset. He had never been accustomed to great stones\r\nthat moved about when no one was touching them, and he looked round for\r\nsome one to ask how it had happened.\r\n\r\nThe only person in sight was another boy in a blue jersey with red\r\nletters on its chest.\r\n\r\n'Hi!' said Edward, and the boy also said 'Hi!'\r\n\r\n'Come along here,' said Edward, 'and I'll show you something.'\r\n\r\n'Right-o!' the boy remarked, and came.\r\n\r\nThe boy was staying at the camp where the white tents were below the\r\nGrand Redoubt. His home was quite unlike Edward's, though he also lived\r\nwith his aunt. The boy's home was very dirty and very small, and nothing\r\nin it was ever in its right place. There was no furniture to speak of.\r\nThe servants did not wear white caps with long streamers, because there\r\nwere no servants. His uncle was a dock-labourer and his aunt went out\r\nwashing. But he had felt just the same pleasure in being shown things\r\nthat Edward or you or I might have felt, and he went climbing over the\r\nbig stones to where Edward stood waiting for him in a sort of pit among\r\nthe stones with the little telescope in his hand.\r\n\r\n'I say,' said Edward, 'did you see any one move these stones?'\r\n\r\n'I ain't only just come up on to the sea-wall,' said the boy, who was\r\ncalled Gustus.\r\n\r\n'They all came round me,' said Edward, rather pale. 'I didn't see any\r\none shoving them.'\r\n\r\n'Who're you a-kiddin' of?' the boy inquired.\r\n\r\n'But I _did_,' said Edward, 'honour bright I did. I was just taking a\r\nsquint through this little telescope I've found--and they came rolling\r\nup to me.'\r\n\r\n'Let's see what you found,' said Gustus, and Edward gave him the glass.\r\nHe directed it with inexpert fingers to the sea-wall, so little trodden\r\nthat on it the grass grows, and the sea-pinks, and even convolvulus and\r\nmock-strawberry.\r\n\r\n'Oh, look!' cried Edward, very loud. 'Look at the grass!'\r\n\r\nGustus let the glass fall to long arm's length and said 'Krikey!'\r\n\r\nThe grass and flowers on the sea-wall had grown a foot and a\r\nhalf--quite tropical they looked.\r\n\r\n'Well?' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter wiv everyfink?' said Gustus. 'We must both be a bit\r\nbalmy, seems ter me.'\r\n\r\n'What's balmy?' asked Edward.\r\n\r\n'Off your chump--looney--like what you and me is,' said Gustus. 'First I\r\nsees things, then I sees you.'\r\n\r\n'It was only fancy, I expect,' said Edward. 'I expect the grass on the\r\nsea-wall was always like that, really.'\r\n\r\n'Let's have a look through your spy-glass at that little barge,' said\r\nGustus, still holding the glass. 'Come on outer these 'ere\r\npaving-stones.'\r\n\r\n'There was a box,' said Edward, 'a box I found with lots of jolly things\r\nin it. I laid it down somewhere--and----'\r\n\r\n'Ain't that it over there?' Gustus asked, and levelled the glass at a\r\ndark object a hundred yards away. 'No; it's only an old boot. I say,\r\nthis is a fine spy-glass. It does make things come big.'\r\n\r\n'That's not it. I'm certain I put it down somewhere just here. Oh,\r\n_don't_!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'Look!' he said, 'look!' and pointed.]\r\n\r\nHe snatched the glass from Gustus.\r\n\r\n'Look!' he said, 'look!' and pointed.\r\n\r\nA hundred yards away stood a boot about as big as the bath you see Marat\r\nin at Madame Tussaud's.\r\n\r\n'S'welp me,' said Gustus, 'we're asleep, both of us, and a-dreaming as\r\nthings grow while we look at them.'\r\n\r\n'But we're not dreaming,' Edward objected. 'You let me pinch you and\r\nyou'll see.'\r\n\r\n'No fun in that,' said Gustus. 'Tell you what--it's the\r\nspy-glass--that's what it is. Ever see any conjuring? I see a chap at\r\nthe Mile End Empire what made things turn into things like winking. It's\r\nthe spy-glass, that's what it is.'\r\n\r\n'It can't be,' said the little boy who lived in a villa.\r\n\r\n'But it _is_,' said the little boy who lived in a slum. 'Teacher says\r\nthere ain't no bounds to the wonders of science. Blest if this ain't one\r\nof 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Let me look,' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'All right; only you mark me. Whatever you sets eyes on'll grow and\r\ngrow--like the flower-tree the conjurer had under the wipe. Don't you\r\nlook at _me_, that's all. Hold on; I'll put something up for you to look\r\nat--a mark like--something as doesn't matter.'\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his pocket and brought out a boot-lace.\r\n\r\n'I hold this up,' he said, 'and you look.'\r\n\r\nNext moment he had dropped the boot-lace, which, swollen as it was with\r\nthe magic of the glass, lay like a snake on the stone at his feet.\r\n\r\nSo the glass _was_ a magic glass, as, of course, you know already.\r\n\r\n'My!' said Gustus, 'wouldn't I like to look at my victuals through that\r\nthere!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus we find Edward, of the villa--and through him Gustus, of the\r\nslum--in possession of a unique instrument of magic. What could they do\r\nwith it?\r\n\r\nThis was the question which they talked over every time they met, and\r\nthey met continually. Edward's aunt, who at home watched him as cats\r\nwatch mice, rashly believed that at the seaside there was no mischief\r\nfor a boy to get into. And the gentleman who commanded the tented camp\r\nbelieved in the ennobling effects of liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter the boot, neither had dared to look at anything through the\r\ntelescope--and so they looked _at_ it, and polished it on their sleeves\r\ntill it shone again.\r\n\r\nBoth were agreed that it would be a fine thing to get some money and\r\nlook at it, so that it would grow big. But Gustus never had any\r\npocket-money, and Edward had had his confiscated to pay for a window he\r\nhad not intended to break.\r\n\r\nGustus felt certain that some one would find out about the spy-glass and\r\ntake it away from them. His experience was that anything you happened to\r\nlike was always taken away. Edward knew that his aunt would want to take\r\nthe telescope away to 'take care of' for him. This had already happened\r\nwith the carved chessmen that his father had sent him from India.\r\n\r\n'I been thinking,' said Gustus, on the third day. 'When I'm a man I'm\r\na-going to be a burglar. You has to use your headpiece in that trade, I\r\ntell you. So I don't think thinking's swipes, like some blokes do. And I\r\nthink p'r'aps it don't turn everything big. An' if we could find out\r\nwhat it don't turn big we could see what we wanted to turn big or what\r\nit didn't turn big, and then it wouldn't turn anything big except what\r\nwe wanted it to. See?'\r\n\r\nEdward did not see; and I don't suppose you do, either.\r\n\r\nSo Gustus went on to explain that teacher had told him there were some\r\nsubstances impervious to light, and some to cold, and so on and so\r\nforth, and that what they wanted was a substance that should be\r\nimpervious to the magic effects of the spy-glass.\r\n\r\n'So if we get a tanner and set it on a plate and squint at it it'll get\r\nbigger--but so'll the plate. And we don't want to litter the place up\r\nwith plates the bigness of cartwheels. But if the plate didn't get big\r\nwe could look at the tanner till it covered the plate, and then go on\r\nlooking and looking and looking and see nothing but the tanner till it\r\nwas as big as a circus. See?'\r\n\r\nThis time Edward did see. But they got no further, because it was time\r\nto go to the circus. There was a circus at Dymchurch just then, and that\r\nwas what made Gustus think of the sixpence growing to that size.\r\n\r\nIt was a very nice circus, and all the boys from the camp went to\r\nit--also Edward, who managed to scramble over and wriggle under benches\r\ntill he was sitting near his friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Far above him and every one else towered the elephant.]\r\n\r\nIt was the size of the elephant that did it. Edward had not seen an\r\nelephant before, and when he saw it, instead of saying, 'What a size he\r\nis!' as everybody else did, he said to himself, 'What a size I could\r\nmake him!' and pulled out the spy-glass, and by a miracle of good luck\r\nor bad got it levelled at the elephant as it went by. He turned the\r\nglass slowly--as it went out--and the elephant only just got out in\r\ntime. Another moment and it would have been too big to get through the\r\ndoor. The audience cheered madly. They thought it was a clever trick;\r\nand so it would have been, very clever.\r\n\r\n'You silly cuckoo,' said Gustus, bitterly, 'now you've turned that\r\ngreat thing loose on the country, and how's his keeper to manage him?'\r\n\r\n'I could make the keeper big, too.'\r\n\r\n'Then if I was you I should just bunk out and do it.'\r\n\r\nEdward obeyed, slipped under the canvas of the circus tent, and found\r\nhimself on the yellow, trampled grass of the field among guy-ropes,\r\norange-peel, banana-skins, and dirty paper. Far above him and every one\r\nelse towered the elephant--it was now as big as the church.\r\n\r\nEdward pointed the glass at the man who was patting the elephant's\r\nfoot--that was as far up as he could reach--and telling it to 'Come down\r\nwith you!' He was very much frightened. He did not know whether you\r\ncould be put in prison for making an elephant's keeper about forty times\r\nhis proper size. But he felt that something must be done to control the\r\ngigantic mountain of black-lead-coloured living flesh. So he looked at\r\nthe keeper through the spy-glass, and the keeper remained his normal\r\nsize!\r\n\r\nIn the shock of this failure he dropped the spy-glass, picked it up, and\r\ntried once more to fix the keeper. Instead he only got a circle of\r\nblack-lead-coloured elephant; and while he was trying to find the\r\nkeeper, and finding nothing but more and more of the elephant, a shout\r\nstartled him and he dropped the glass once more. He was a very clumsy\r\nlittle boy, was Edward.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said one of the men, 'what a turn it give me! I thought Jumbo'd\r\ngrown as big as a railway station, s'welp me if I didn't.'\r\n\r\n'Now that's rum,' said another, 'so did I.'\r\n\r\n'And he _ain't_,' said a third; 'seems to me he's a bit below his usual\r\nfigure. Got a bit thin or somethink, ain't he?'\r\n\r\nEdward slipped back into the tent unobserved.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he whispered to his friend, 'he's gone back to his\r\nproper size, and the man didn't change at all.'\r\n\r\n'Ho!' Gustus said slowly--'Ho! All right. Conjuring's a rum thing. You\r\ndon't never know where you are!'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think you might as well be a conjurer as a burglar?'\r\nsuggested Edward, who had had his friend's criminal future rather\r\npainfully on his mind for the last hour.\r\n\r\n'_You_ might,' said Gustus, 'not me. My people ain't dooks to set me up\r\non any such a swell lay as conjuring. Now I'm going to think, I am. You\r\nhold your jaw and look at the 'andsome Dona a-doin' of 'er griceful\r\nbarebacked hact.'\r\n\r\nThat evening after tea Edward went, as he had been told to do, to the\r\nplace on the shore where the big stones had taught him the magic of the\r\nspy-glass.\r\n\r\nGustus was already at the tryst.\r\n\r\n'See here,' he said, 'I'm a-goin' to do something brave and fearless, I\r\nam, like Lord Nelson and the boy on the fire-ship. You out with that\r\nspy-glass, an' I'll let you look at _me_. Then we'll know where we are.'\r\n\r\n'But s'pose you turn into a giant?'\r\n\r\n'Don't care. 'Sides, I shan't. T'other bloke didn't.'\r\n\r\n'P'r'aps,' said Edward, cautiously, 'it only works by the seashore.'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said Gustus, reproachfully, 'you've been a-trying to think, that's\r\nwhat you've been a-doing. What about the elephant, my emernent\r\nscientister? Now, then!'\r\n\r\nVery much afraid, Edward pulled out the glass and looked.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing happened.\r\n\r\n'That's number one,' said Gustus, 'now, number two.'\r\n\r\nHe snatched the telescope from Edward's hand, and turned it round and\r\nlooked through the other end at the great stones. Edward, standing by,\r\nsaw them get smaller and smaller--turn to pebbles, to beach, to sand.\r\nWhen Gustus turned the glass to the giant grass and flowers on the\r\nsea-wall, they also drew back into themselves, got smaller and smaller,\r\nand presently were as they had been before ever Edward picked up the\r\nmagic spy-glass.\r\n\r\n'Now we know all about it--I _don't_ think,' said Gustus. 'To-morrow\r\nwe'll have a look at that there model engine of yours that you say\r\nworks.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It became a quite efficient motor.]\r\n\r\nThey did. They had a look at it through the spy-glass, and it became a\r\nquite efficient motor; of rather an odd pattern it is true, and very\r\nbumpy, but capable of quite a decent speed. They went up to the hills in\r\nit, and so odd was its design that no one who saw it ever forgot it.\r\nPeople talk about that rummy motor at Bonnington and Aldington to this\r\nday. They stopped often, to use the spy-glass on various objects. Trees,\r\nfor instance, could be made to grow surprisingly, and there were patches\r\nof giant wheat found that year near Ashford that were never\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for. Blackberries, too, could be enlarged to a\r\nmost wonderful and delicious fruit. And the sudden growth of a fugitive\r\ntoffee-drop found in Edward's pocket and placed on the hand was a happy\r\nsurprise. When you scraped the pocket dirt off the outside you had a\r\npound of delicious toffee. Not so happy was the incident of the earwig,\r\nwhich crawled into view when Edward was enlarging a wild strawberry, and\r\nhad grown the size of a rat before the slow but horrified Edward gained\r\ncourage to shake it off.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful drive. As they came home they met a woman driving a\r\nweak-looking little cow. It went by on one side of the engine and the\r\nwoman went by on the other. When they were restored to each other the\r\ncow was nearly the size of a cart-horse, and the woman did not recognise\r\nit. She ran back along the road after her cow, which must, she said,\r\nhave taken fright at the beastly motor. She scolded violently as she\r\nwent. So the boys had to make the cow small again, when she wasn't\r\nlooking.\r\n\r\n'This is all very well,' said Gustus, 'but we've got our fortune to\r\nmake, I don't think. We've got to get hold of a tanner--or a bob would\r\nbe better.'\r\n\r\nBut this was not possible, because that broken window wasn't paid for,\r\nand Gustus never had any money.\r\n\r\n'We ought to be the benefactors of the human race,' said Edward; 'make\r\nall the good things more and all the bad things less.'\r\n\r\nAnd _that_ was all very well--but the cow hadn't been a great success,\r\nas Gustus reminded him.\r\n\r\n'I see I shall have to do some of my thinking,' he added.\r\n\r\nThey stopped in a quiet road close by Dymchurch; the engine was made\r\nsmall again, and Edward went home with it under his arm.\r\n\r\nIt was the next day that they found the shilling on the road. They could\r\nhardly believe their good luck. They went out on to the shore with it,\r\nput it on Edward's hand while Gustus looked at it with the glass, and\r\nthe shilling began to grow.\r\n\r\n'It's as big as a saucer,' said Edward, 'and it's heavy. I'll rest it on\r\nthese stones. It's as big as a plate; it's as big as a tea-tray; it's as\r\nbig as a cart-wheel.'\r\n\r\nAnd it was.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Gustus, 'we'll go and borrow a cart to take it away. Come\r\non.'\r\n\r\nBut Edward could not come on. His hand was in the hollow between the two\r\nstones, and above lay tons of silver. He could not move, and the stones\r\ncouldn't move. There was nothing for it but to look at the great round\r\nlump of silver through the wrong end of the spy-glass till it got small\r\nenough for Edward to lift it. And then, unfortunately, Gustus looked a\r\nlittle too long, and the shilling, having gone back to its own size,\r\nwent a little further--and it went to sixpenny size, and then went out\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nSo nobody got anything by that.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the time when, as was to be expected, Edward dropped the\r\ntelescope in his aunt's presence. She said, 'What's that?' picked it up\r\nwith quite unfair quickness, and looked through it, and through the open\r\nwindow at a fishing-boat, which instantly swelled to the size of a\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\n'My goodness! what a strong glass!' said the aunt.\r\n\r\n'Isn't it?' said Edward, gently taking it from her. He looked at the\r\nship through the glass's other end till she got to her proper size again\r\nand then smaller. He just stopped in time to prevent its disappearing\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n'I'll take care of it for you,' said the aunt. And for the first time in\r\ntheir lives Edward said 'No' to his aunt.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible moment.\r\n\r\nEdward, quite frenzied by his own courage, turned the glass on one\r\nobject after another--the furniture grew as he looked, and when he\r\nlowered the glass the aunt was pinned fast between a monster table-leg\r\nand a great chiffonier.\r\n\r\n'There!' said Edward. 'And I shan't let you out till you say you won't\r\ntake it to take care of either.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, have it your own way,' said the aunt, faintly, and closed her eyes.\r\nWhen she opened them the furniture was its right size and Edward was\r\ngone. He had twinges of conscience, but the aunt never mentioned the\r\nsubject again. I have reason to suppose that _she_ supposed that she had\r\nhad a fit of an unusual and alarming nature.\r\n\r\nNext day the boys in the camp were to go back to their slums. Edward and\r\nGustus parted on the seashore and Edward cried. He had never met a boy\r\nwhom he liked as he liked Gustus. And Gustus himself was almost melted.\r\n\r\n'I will say for you you're more like a man and less like a snivelling\r\nwhite rabbit now than what you was when I met you. Well, we ain't done\r\nnothing to speak of with that there conjuring trick of yours, but we've\r\n'ad a right good time. So long. See you 'gain some day.'\r\n\r\nEdward hesitated, spluttered, and still weeping flung his arms round\r\nGustus.\r\n\r\n''Ere, none o' that,' said Gustus, sternly. 'If you ain't man enough to\r\nknow better, I am. Shake 'ands like a Briton; right about face--and part\r\ngame.'\r\n\r\nHe suited the action to the word.\r\n\r\nEdward went back to his aunt snivelling, defenceless but happy. He had\r\nnever had a friend except Gustus, and now he had given Gustus the\r\ngreatest treasure that he possessed.\r\n\r\nFor Edward was not such a white rabbit as he seemed. And in that last\r\nembrace he had managed to slip the little telescope into the pocket of\r\nthe reefer coat which Gustus wore, ready for his journey.\r\n\r\nIt was the greatest treasure that Edward had, but it was also the\r\ngreatest responsibility, so that while he felt the joy of self-sacrifice\r\nhe also felt the rapture of relief. Life is full of such mixed moments.\r\n\r\nAnd the holidays ended and Edward went back to his villa. Be sure he had\r\ngiven Gustus his home address, and begged him to write, but Gustus never\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nPresently Edward's father came home from India, and they left his aunt\r\nto her villa and went to live at a jolly little house on a sloping hill\r\nat Chiselhurst, which was Edward's father's very own. They were not\r\nrich, and Edward could not go to a very good school, and though there\r\nwas enough to eat and wear, what there was was very plain. And Edward's\r\nfather had been wounded, and somehow had not got a pension.\r\n\r\nNow one night in the next summer Edward woke up in his bed with the\r\nfeeling that there was some one in the room. And there was. A dark\r\nfigure was squeezing itself through the window. Edward was far too\r\nfrightened to scream. He simply lay and listened to his heart. It was\r\nlike listening to a cheap American clock. The next moment a lantern\r\nflashed in his eyes and a masked face bent over him.\r\n\r\n'Where does your father keep his money?' said a muffled voice.\r\n\r\n'In the b-b-b-b-bank,' replied the wretched Edward, truthfully.\r\n\r\n'I mean what he's got in the house.'\r\n\r\n'In his trousers pocket,' said Edward, 'only he puts it in the\r\ndressing-table drawer at night.'\r\n\r\n'You must go and get it,' said the burglar, for such he plainly was.\r\n\r\n'Must I?' said Edward, wondering how he could get out of betraying his\r\nfather's confidence and being branded as a criminal.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the burglar in an awful voice, 'get up and go.'\r\n\r\n'_No_,' said Edward, and he was as much surprised at his courage as you\r\nare.\r\n\r\n'Bravo!' said the burglar, flinging off his mask. 'I see you _aren't_\r\nsuch a white rabbit as what I thought you.'\r\n\r\n'It's Gustus,' said Edward. 'Oh, Gustus, I'm so glad! Oh, Gustus, I'm so\r\nsorry! I always hoped you wouldn't be a burglar. And now you are.'\r\n\r\n'I am so,' said Gustus, with pride, 'but,' he added sadly, 'this is my\r\nfirst burglary.'\r\n\r\n'Couldn't it be the last?' suggested Edward.\r\n\r\n'That,' replied Gustus, 'depends on you.'\r\n\r\n'I'll do anything,' said Edward, 'anything.'\r\n\r\n'You see,' said Gustus, sitting down on the edge of the bed in a\r\nconfidential attitude, with the dark lantern in one hand and the mask in\r\nthe other, 'when you're as hard up as we are, there's not much of a\r\nliving to be made honest. I'm sure I wonder we don't all of us turn\r\nburglars, so I do. And that glass of yours--you little beggar--you did\r\nme proper--sticking of that thing in my pocket like what you did. Well,\r\nit kept us alive last winter, that's a cert. I used to look at the\r\nvictuals with it, like what I said I would. A farden's worth o'\r\npease-pudden was a dinner for three when that glass was about, and a\r\npenn'orth o' scraps turned into a big beef-steak almost. They used to\r\nwonder how I got so much for the money. But I'm always afraid o' being\r\nfound out--or of losing the blessed spy-glass--or of some one pinching\r\nit. So we got to do what I always said--make some use of it. And if I go\r\nalong and nick your father's dibs we'll make our fortunes right away.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Edward, 'but I'll ask father.'\r\n\r\n'Rot.' Gustus was crisp and contemptuous. 'He'd think you was off your\r\nchump, and he'd get me lagged.'\r\n\r\n'It would be stealing,' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'Not when you'll pay it back.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it would,' said Edward. 'Oh, don't ask me--I can't.'\r\n\r\n'Then I shall,' said Gustus. 'Where's his room.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't!' said Edward. 'I've got a half-sovereign of my own. I'll\r\ngive you that.'\r\n\r\n'Lawk!' said Gustus. 'Why the blue monkeys couldn't you say so? Come\r\non.'\r\n\r\nHe pulled Edward out of bed by the leg, hurried his clothes on anyhow,\r\nand half-dragged, half-coaxed him through the window and down by the ivy\r\nand the chicken-house roof.\r\n\r\nThey stood face to face in the sloping garden and Edward's teeth\r\nchattered. Gustus caught him by his hand, and led him away.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the shrubbery, where the rockery was, Gustus stooped\r\nand dragged out a big clinker--then another, and another. There was a\r\nhole like a big rabbit-hole. If Edward had really been a white rabbit it\r\nwould just have fitted him.\r\n\r\n'I'll go first,' said Gustus, and went, head-foremost. 'Come on,' he\r\nsaid, hollowly, from inside. And Edward, too, went. It was dreadful\r\ncrawling into that damp hole in the dark. As his head got through the\r\nhole he saw that it led to a cave, and below him stood a dark figure.\r\nThe lantern was on the ground.\r\n\r\n'Come on,' said Gustus, 'I'll catch you if you fall.'\r\n\r\nWith a rush and a scramble Edward got in.\r\n\r\n'It's caves,' said Gustus. 'A chap I know that goes about the country\r\nbottoming cane-chairs, 'e told me about it. And I nosed about and found\r\nhe lived here. So then I thought what a go. So now we'll put your\r\nhalf-shiner down and look at it, and we'll have a gold-mine, and you can\r\npretend to find it.'\r\n\r\n'Halves!' said Edward, briefly and firmly.\r\n\r\n'You're a man,' said Gustus. 'Now, then!' He led the way through a maze\r\nof chalk caves till they came to a convenient spot, which he had marked.\r\nAnd now Edward emptied his pockets on the sand--he had brought all the\r\ncontents of his money-box, and there was more silver than gold, and more\r\ncopper than either, and more odd rubbish than there was anything else.\r\nYou know what a boy's pockets are like. Stones and putty, and\r\nslate-pencils and marbles--I urge in excuse that Edward was a very\r\nlittle boy--a bit of plasticine, one or two bits of wood.\r\n\r\n'No time to sort 'em,' said Gustus, and, putting the lantern in a\r\nsuitable position, he got out the glass and began to look through it at\r\nthe tumbled heap.\r\n\r\nAnd the heap began to grow. It grew out sideways till it touched the\r\nwalls of the recess, and outwards till it touched the top of the recess,\r\nand then it slowly worked out into the big cave and came nearer and\r\nnearer to the boys. Everything grew--stones, putty, money, wood,\r\nplasticine.\r\n\r\nEdward patted the growing mass as though it were alive and he loved it,\r\nand Gustus said:\r\n\r\n'Here's clothes, and beef, and bread, and tea, and coffee--and\r\nbaccy--and a good school, and me a engineer. I see it all a-growing and\r\na-growing.'\r\n\r\n'Hi--stop!' said Edward suddenly.\r\n\r\nGustus dropped the telescope. It rolled away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n'Now you've done it,' said Edward.\r\n\r\n'What?' said Gustus.\r\n\r\n'My hand,' said Edward, 'it's fast between the rock and the gold and\r\nthings. Find the glass and make it go smaller so that I can get my hand\r\nout.'\r\n\r\nBut Gustus could not find the glass. And, what is more, no one ever has\r\nfound it to this day.\r\n\r\n'It's no good,' said Gustus, at last. 'I'll go and find your father.\r\nThey must come and dig you out of this precious Tom Tiddler's ground.'\r\n\r\n'And they'll lag you if they see you. You said they would,' said Edward,\r\nnot at all sure what lagging was, but sure that it was something\r\ndreadful. 'Write a letter and put it in his letter-box. They'll find it\r\nin the morning.'\r\n\r\n'And leave you pinned by the hand all night? Likely--I _don't_ think,'\r\nsaid Gustus.\r\n\r\n'I'd rather,' said Edward, bravely, but his voice was weak. 'I couldn't\r\nbear you to be lagged, Gustus. I do love you so.'\r\n\r\n'None of that,' said Gustus, sternly. 'I'll leave you the lamp; I can\r\nfind my way with matches. Keep up your pecker, and never say die.'\r\n\r\n'I won't,' said Edward, bravely. 'Oh, Gustus!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was how it happened that Edward's father was roused from slumbers\r\nby violent shakings from an unknown hand, while an unknown voice\r\nuttered these surprising words:--\r\n\r\n'Edward is in the gold and silver and copper mine that we've found under\r\nyour garden. Come and get him out.'\r\n\r\nWhen Edward's father was at last persuaded that Gustus was not a silly\r\ndream--and this took some time--he got up.\r\n\r\nHe did not believe a word that Gustus said, even when Gustus added\r\n'S'welp me!' which he did several times.\r\n\r\nBut Edward's bed was empty--his clothes gone.\r\n\r\nEdward's father got the gardener from next door--with, at the suggestion\r\nof Gustus, a pick--the hole in the rockery was enlarged, and they all\r\ngot in.\r\n\r\nAnd when they got to the place where Edward was, there, sure enough, was\r\nEdward, pinned by the hand between a piece of wood and a piece of rock.\r\nNeither the father nor the gardener noticed any metal. Edward had\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nThey got him out; a couple of strokes with the pick released his hand,\r\nbut it was bruised and bleeding.\r\n\r\nThey all turned to go, but they had not gone twenty yards before there\r\nwas a crash and a loud report like thunder, and a slow rumbling,\r\nrattling noise very dreadful to hear.\r\n\r\n'Get out of this quick, sir,' said the gardener; 'the roof's fell in;\r\nthis part of the caves ain't safe.'\r\n\r\nEdward was very feverish and ill for several days, during which he told\r\nhis father the whole story--of which his father did not believe a word.\r\nBut he was kind to Gustus, because Gustus was evidently fond of Edward.\r\n\r\nWhen Edward was well enough to walk in the garden his father and he\r\nfound that a good deal of the shrubbery had sunk, so that the trees\r\nlooked as though they were growing in a pit.\r\n\r\nIt spoiled the look of the garden, and Edward's father decided to move\r\nthe trees to the other side.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done the first tree uprooted showed a dark hollow below\r\nit. The man is not born who will not examine and explore a dark hollow\r\nin his own grounds. So Edward's father explored.\r\n\r\nThis is the true story of the discovery of that extraordinary vein of\r\nsilver, copper, and gold which has excited so much interest in\r\nscientific and mining circles. Learned papers have been written about\r\nit, learned professors have been rude to each other about it, but no one\r\nknows how it came there except Gustus and Edward and you and me.\r\nEdward's father is quite as ignorant as any one else, but he is much\r\nricher than most of them; and, at any rate, he knows that it was Gustus\r\nwho first told him of the gold-mine, and who risked being\r\nlagged--arrested by the police, that is--rather than let Edward wait\r\ntill morning with his hand fast between wood and rock.\r\n\r\nSo Edward and Gustus have been to a good school, and now they are at\r\nWinchester, and presently they will be at Oxford. And when Gustus is\r\ntwenty-one he will have half the money that came from the gold-mine. And\r\nthen he and Edward mean to start a school of their own. And the boys who\r\nare to go to it are to be the sort of boys who go to the summer camp of\r\nthe Grand Redoubt near the sea--the kind of boy that Gustus was.\r\n\r\nSo the spy-glass will do some good after all, though it _was_ so\r\nunmanageable to begin with.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may even be found again. But I rather hope it won't. It\r\nmight, really, have done much more mischief than it did--and if any one\r\nfound it, it might do more yet.\r\n\r\nThere is no moral to this story, except.... But no--there is no moral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quentin de Ward.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL MAGIC; OR DON'T TELL ALL YOU KNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nQuentin de Ward was rather a nice little boy, but he had never been with\r\nother little boys, and that made him in some ways a little different\r\nfrom other little boys. His father was in India, and he and his mother\r\nlived in a little house in the New Forest. The house--it was a cottage\r\nreally, but even a cottage is a house, isn't it?--was very pretty and\r\nthatched and had a porch covered with honeysuckle and ivy and white\r\nroses, and straight red hollyhocks were trained to stand up in a row\r\nagainst the south wall of it. The two lived quite alone, and as they had\r\nno one else to talk to they talked to each other a good deal. Mrs. de\r\nWard read a great many books, and she used to tell Quentin about them\r\nafterwards. They were usually books about out of the way things, for\r\nMrs. de Ward was interested in all the things that people are not quite\r\nsure about--the things that are hidden and secret, wonderful and\r\nmysterious--the things people make discoveries about. So that when the\r\ntwo were having their tea on the little brick terrace in front of the\r\nhollyhocks, with the white cloth flapping in the breeze, and the wasps\r\nhovering round the jam-pot, it was no uncommon thing for Quentin to say\r\nthickly through his bread and jam:--\r\n\r\n'I say, mother, tell me some more about Atlantis.' Or, 'Mother, tell me\r\nsome more about ancient Egypt and the little toy-boats they made for\r\ntheir little boys.' Or, 'Mother, tell me about the people who think Lord\r\nBacon wrote Shakespeare.'\r\n\r\nAnd his mother always told him as much as she thought he could\r\nunderstand, and he always understood quite half of what she told him.\r\n\r\nThey always talked the things out thoroughly, and thus he learned to be\r\nfond of arguing, and to enjoy using his brains, just as you enjoy using\r\nyour muscles in the football field or the gymnasium.\r\n\r\nAlso he came to know quite a lot of odd, out of the way things, and to\r\nhave opinions of his own concerning the lost Kingdom of Atlantis, and\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask, the building of Stonehenge, the Pre-dynastic\r\nEgyptians, cuneiform writings and Assyrian sculptures, the Mexican\r\npyramids and the shipping activities of Tyre and Sidon.\r\n\r\nQuentin did no regular lessons, such as most boys have, but he read all\r\nsorts of books and made notes from them, in a large and straggling\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nYou will already have supposed that Quentin was a prig. But he wasn't,\r\nand you would have owned this if you had seen him scampering through the\r\ngreenwood on his quiet New Forest pony, or setting snares for the\r\nrabbits that _would_ get into the garden and eat the precious lettuces\r\nand parsley. Also he fished in the little streams that run through that\r\nlovely land, and shot with a bow and arrows. And he was a very good\r\nshot too.\r\n\r\nBesides this he collected stamps and birds' eggs and picture post-cards,\r\nand kept guinea-pigs and bantams, and climbed trees and tore his clothes\r\nin twenty different ways. And once he fought the grocer's boy and got\r\nlicked and didn't cry, and made friends with the grocer's boy\r\nafterwards, and got him to show him all he knew about fighting, so you\r\nsee he was really not a mug. He was ten years old and he had enjoyed\r\nevery moment of his ten years, even the sleeping ones, because he always\r\ndreamed jolly dreams, though he could not always remember what they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nI tell you all this so that you may understand why he said what he did\r\nwhen his mother broke the news to him.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting by the stream that ran along the end of the garden,\r\nmaking bricks of the clay that the stream's banks were made of. He dried\r\nthem in the sun, and then baked them under the kitchen stove. (It is\r\nquite a good way to make bricks--you might try it sometimes.) His mother\r\ncame out, looking just as usual, in her pink cotton gown and her pink\r\nsunbonnet; and she had a letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n'Hullo, boy of my heart,' she said, 'very busy?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Quentin importantly, not looking up, and going on with his\r\nwork. 'I'm making stones to build Stonehenge with. You'll show me how to\r\nbuild it, won't you, mother.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear,' she said absently. 'Yes, if I can.'\r\n\r\n'Of course you can,' he said, 'you can do everything.'\r\n\r\nShe sat down on a tuft of grass near him.\r\n\r\n'Quentin dear,' she said, and something in her voice made him look up\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n'Oh, mother, what is it?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Daddy's been wounded,' she said; 'he's all right now, dear--don't be\r\nfrightened. Only I've got to go out to him. I shall meet him in Egypt.\r\nAnd you must go to school in Salisbury, a very nice school, dear, till I\r\ncome back.'\r\n\r\n'Can't I come too?' he asked.\r\n\r\nAnd when he understood that he could not he went on with the bricks in\r\nsilence, with his mouth shut very tight.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he said, 'Salisbury? Then I shall see Stonehenge?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said his mother, pleased that he took the news so calmly, 'you\r\nwill be sure to see Stonehenge some time.'\r\n\r\nHe stood still, looking down at the little mould of clay in his hand--so\r\nstill that his mother got up and came close to him.\r\n\r\n'Quentin,' she said, 'darling, what is it?'\r\n\r\nHe leaned his head against her.\r\n\r\n'I won't make a fuss,' he said, 'but you can't begin to be brave the\r\nvery first minute. Or, if you do, you can't go on being.'\r\n\r\nAnd with that he began to cry, though he had not cried after the affair\r\nof the grocer's boy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thought of school was not so terrible to Quentin as Mrs. de Ward had\r\nthought it would be. In fact, he rather liked it, with half his mind;\r\nbut the other half didn't like it, because it meant parting from his\r\nmother who, so far, had been his only friend. But it was exciting to be\r\ntaken to Southampton, and have all sorts of new clothes bought for you,\r\nand a school trunk, and a little polished box that locked up, to keep\r\nyour money in and your gold sleeve links, and your watch and chain when\r\nyou were not wearing them.\r\n\r\nAlso the journey to Salisbury was made in a motor, which was very\r\nexciting of course, and rather took Quentin's mind off the parting with\r\nhis mother, as she meant it should. And there was a very grand lunch at\r\nThe White Hart Hotel at Salisbury, and then, very suddenly indeed, it\r\nwas good-bye, good-bye, and the motor snorted, and hooted, and throbbed,\r\nand rushed away, and mother was gone, and Quentin was at school.\r\n\r\nI believe it was quite a nice school. It was in a very nice house with a\r\nlarge quiet garden, and there were only about twenty boys. And the\r\nmasters were kind, and the boys no worse than other boys of their age.\r\nBut Quentin hated it from the very beginning. For when his mother had\r\ngone the Headmaster said: 'School will be out in half-an-hour; take a\r\nbook, de Ward,' and gave him _Little Eric and his Friends_, a mere baby\r\nbook. It was too silly. He could not read it. He saw on a shelf near\r\nhim, _Smith's Antiquities_, a very old friend of his, so he said: 'I'd\r\nrather have this, please.'\r\n\r\n'You should say \"sir\" when you speak to a master,' the Head said to him.\r\n'Take the book by all means.' To himself the Head said, 'I wish you joy\r\nof it, you little prig.'\r\n\r\nWhen school was over, one of the boys was told to show Quentin his bed\r\nand his locker. The matron had already unpacked his box and his pile of\r\nbooks was waiting for him to carry it over.\r\n\r\n'Golly, what a lot of books,' said Smithson minor. 'What's this?\r\n_Atlantis_? Is it a jolly story?'\r\n\r\n'It isn't a story,' said Quentin. And just then the classical master\r\ncame by. 'What's that about _Atlantis_?' he said.\r\n\r\n'It's a book the new chap's got,' said Smithson.\r\n\r\nThe classical master glanced at the book.\r\n\r\n'And how much do you understand of this?' he asked, fluttering the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n'Nearly all, I think,' said Quentin.\r\n\r\n'You should say \"sir\" when you speak to a master,' said the classical\r\none; and to himself he added, 'little prig.' Then he said to Quentin: 'I\r\nam afraid you will find yourself rather out of your element among\r\nordinary boys.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think so,' said Quentin calmly, adding as an afterthought\r\n'sir.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad you're so confident,' said the classical master and went.\r\n\r\n'My word,' said Smithson minor in a rather awed voice, 'you did answer\r\nhim back.'\r\n\r\n'Of course I did,' said Quentin. 'Don't _you_ answer when you're spoken\r\nto?'\r\n\r\nSmithson minor informed the interested school that the new chap was a\r\nprig, but he had a cool cheek, and that some sport might be expected.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the boys had half an hour's recreation. Quentin, who was\r\ntired, picked up a book which a big boy had just put down. It was the\r\n_Midsummer Night's Dream_.\r\n\r\n'Hi, you kid,' said the big boy, 'don't pretend you read Shakespeare for\r\nfun. That's simple swank, you know.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what swank is,' said Quentin, 'but I like the _Midsummer_\r\nwhoever wrote it.'\r\n\r\n'Whoever _what_?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Quentin, 'there's a good deal to be said for its being\r\nBacon who wrote the plays.'\r\n\r\nOf course that settled it. From that moment, he was called not de Ward,\r\nwhich was strange enough, but Bacon. He rather liked that. But the next\r\nday it was Pork, and the day after Pig, and that was unbearable.\r\n\r\nHe was at the bottom of his class, for he knew no Latin as it is taught\r\nin schools, only odd words that English words come from, and some Latin\r\nwords that are used in science. And I cannot pretend that his arithmetic\r\nwas anything but contemptible.\r\n\r\nThe book called _Atlantis_ had been looked at by most of the school, and\r\nSmithson major, not nearly such an agreeable boy as his brother, hit on\r\na new nickname.\r\n\r\n'Atlantic Pork's a good name for a swanker,' he said. 'You know the\r\nrotten meat they have in Chicago.'\r\n\r\nThis was in the playground before dinner. Quentin, who had to keep his\r\nmouth shut very tight these days, because, of course, a boy of ten\r\ncannot cry before other chaps, shut the book he was reading and looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'I won't be called that,' he said quietly.\r\n\r\n'Who said you wouldn't?' said Smithson major, who, after all, was only\r\ntwelve. 'I say you will.'\r\n\r\n'If you call me that I shall hit you,' said Quentin, 'as hard as I can.'\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter went up, and cries of, 'Poor old\r\nSmithson'--'Apologise, Smithie, and leave the omnibus.'\r\n\r\n'And what should I be doing while you were hitting me?' asked Smithson\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It landed on the point of the chin of Smithson major.]\r\n\r\n'I don't know and I don't care,' said Quentin.\r\n\r\nSmithson looked round. No master was in sight. It seemed an excellent\r\nopportunity to teach young de Ward his place.\r\n\r\n'Atlantic pig-swine,' he said very deliberately. And Quentin sprang at\r\nhim, and instantly it was a fight.\r\n\r\nNow Quentin had only once fought--really fought--before. Then it was\r\nthe grocer's boy and he had been beaten. But he had learned something\r\nsince. And the chief conclusion he now drew from his memories of that\r\nfight was that he had not hit half hard enough, an opinion almost\r\nuniversal among those who have fought and not won.\r\n\r\nAs the fist of Smithson major described a half circle and hurt his ear\r\nvery much, Quentin suddenly screwed himself up and hit out with his\r\nright hand, straight, and with his whole weight behind the blow as the\r\ngrocer's boy had shown him. All his grief for his wounded father, his\r\nsorrow at the parting from his mother, all his hatred of his school, and\r\nhis contempt for his schoolfellows went into that blow. It landed on the\r\npoint of the chin of Smithson major who fell together like a heap of\r\nrags.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Quentin, gazing with interest at his hand--it hurt a good\r\ndeal but he looked at it with respect--'I'm afraid I've hurt him.'\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten for a moment that he was in an enemies' country, and\r\nso, apparently, had his enemies.\r\n\r\n'Well done, Piggy! Bravo, young 'un! Well hit, by Jove!'\r\n\r\nFriendly hands thumped him on the back. Smithson major was no popular\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nQuentin felt--as his schoolfellows would have put it--bucked. It is one\r\nthing to be called Pig in enmity and derision. Another to be called\r\nPiggy--an affectionate diminutive, after all--to the chorus of admiring\r\nsmacks.\r\n\r\n'Get up, Smithie,' cried the ring. 'Want any more?'\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Smithie did not want any more. He lay, not moving at\r\nall, and very white.\r\n\r\n'I say,' the crowd's temper veered, 'you've killed him, I expect. I\r\nwouldn't like to be you, Bacon.'\r\n\r\nPig, you notice, for aggravation--Piggy in enthusiastic applause. In the\r\nmoment of possible tragedy the more formal Bacon.\r\n\r\n'I haven't,' said Quentin, very white himself, 'but if I have he\r\nbegan--by calling names.'\r\n\r\nSmithson moved and grunted. A sigh of relief swept the ring as a breeze\r\nsweeps a cornfield.\r\n\r\n'He's all right. A fair knock out. Piggy's got the use of 'em. Do\r\nSmithie good.' The voices hushed suddenly. A master was on the\r\nscene--the classical master.\r\n\r\n'Fighting?' he said. 'The new boy? Who began it?'\r\n\r\n'I did,' said Quentin, 'but he began with calling names.'\r\n\r\n'Sneak!' murmured the entire school, and Quentin, who had seen no reason\r\nfor not speaking the truth, perceived that one should not tell all one\r\nknows, and that once more he stood alone in the world.\r\n\r\n'You will go to your room, de Ward,' said the classical master, bending\r\nover Smithson, who having been 'knocked silly' still remained in that\r\ncondition, 'and the headmaster will consider your case to-morrow. You\r\nwill probably be expelled.'\r\n\r\nQuentin went to his room and thought over his position. It seemed to be\r\ndesperate. How was he to know that the classical master was even then\r\nsaying to the Head:\r\n\r\n'He's got something in him, prig or no prig, sir.'\r\n\r\n'You were quite right to send him to his room,' said the Head,\r\n'discipline must be maintained, as Mr. Ducket says. But it will do\r\nSmithson major a world of good. A boy who reads Shakespeare for fun, and\r\nhas views about Atlantis, and can knock out a bully as well.... He'll be\r\na power in the school. But we mustn't let him know it.'\r\n\r\nThat was rather a pity. Because Quentin, furious at the injustice of the\r\nwhole thing--Smithson, the aggressor, consoled with; himself punished;\r\nexpulsion threatened--was maturing plans.\r\n\r\n'If mother had known what it was like,' he said to himself, 'she would\r\nnever have left me here. I've got the two pounds she gave me. I shall\r\ngo to the White Hart at Salisbury ... no, they'd find me then. I'll go\r\nto Lyndhurst; and write to her. It's better to run away than to be\r\nexpelled. Quentin Durward would never have waited to be expelled from\r\nanywhere.'\r\n\r\nOf course Quentin Durward was my hero's hero. It could not be otherwise\r\nsince his own name was so like that of the Scottish guardsman.\r\n\r\nNow the school in Salisbury was a little school for little boys--boys\r\nwho were used to schools and took the rough with the smooth. But Quentin\r\nwas not used to schools, and he had taken the rough very much to heart.\r\nSo much that he did not mean to take any more of it.\r\n\r\nHis dinner was brought up on a tray--bread and water. He put the bread\r\nin his pocket. Then when he knew that every one was at dinner in the\r\nlong dining-room at the back of the house, he just walked very quietly\r\ndown the stairs, opened the side door and marched out, down the garden\r\npath and out at the tradesmen's gate. He knew better than to shut either\r\ngate or door.\r\n\r\nHe went quickly down the street, turned the first corner he came to so\r\nas to get out of sight of the school. He turned another corner, went\r\nthrough an archway, and found himself in an inn-yard--very quiet indeed.\r\nOnly a liver-coloured lurcher dog wagged a sleepy tail on the hot\r\nflag-stones.\r\n\r\nQuentin was just turning to go back through the arch, for there was no\r\nother way out of the yard, when he saw a big covered cart, whose horse\r\nwore a nose-bag and looked as if there was no hurry. The cart bore the\r\nname, 'Miles, Carrier, Lyndhurst.'\r\n\r\nQuentin knew all about lifts. He had often begged them and got them. Now\r\nthere was no one to ask. But he felt he could very well explain later\r\nthat he had wanted a lift, much better than now, in fact, when he might\r\nbe caught at any moment by some one from the school.\r\n\r\nHe climbed up by the shaft. There were boxes and packages of all sorts\r\nin the cart, and at the back an empty crate with sacking over it. He got\r\ninto the crate, pulled the sacking over himself, and settled down to eat\r\nhis bread.\r\n\r\nPresently the carrier came out, and there was talk, slow, long-drawn\r\ntalk. After a long while the cart shook to the carrier's heavy climb\r\ninto it, the harness rattled, the cart lurched, and the wheels were loud\r\nand bumpy over the cobble stones of the yard.\r\n\r\nQuentin felt safe. The glow of anger was still hot in him, and he was\r\nglad to think how they would look for him all over the town, in vain. He\r\nlifted the sacking at one corner so that he could look out between the\r\ncanvas of the cart's back and side, and hoped to see the classical\r\nmaster distractedly looking for him. But the streets were very sleepy.\r\nEvery one in Salisbury was having dinner--or in the case of the\r\naffluent, lunch.\r\n\r\nThe black horse seemed as sleepy as the streets, and went very slowly.\r\nAlso it stopped very often, and wherever there were parcels to leave\r\nthere was slow, long talkings to be exchanged. I think, perhaps, Quentin\r\ndozed a good deal under his sacks. At any rate it was with a shock of\r\nsurprise that he suddenly heard the carrier's voice saying, as the horse\r\nstopped with a jerk:\r\n\r\n'There's a crate for you, Mrs. Baddock, returned empty,' and knew that\r\nthat crate was not empty, but full--full of boy.\r\n\r\n'I'll go and call Joe,' said a voice--Mrs. Baddock's, Quentin supposed,\r\nand slow feet stumped away over stones. Mr. Miles leisurely untied the\r\ntail of the cart, ready to let the crate be taken out.\r\n\r\nQuentin spent a paralytic moment. What could he do?\r\n\r\nAnd then, luckily or unluckily, a reckless motor tore past, and the\r\nblack horse plunged and Mr. Miles had to go to its head and 'talk\r\npretty' to it for a minute. And in that minute Quentin lifted the\r\nsacking, and looked out. It was low sunset, and the street was deserted.\r\nHe stepped out of the crate, dropped to the ground, and slipped behind a\r\nstout and friendly water-butt that seemed to offer protective shelter.\r\n\r\nJoe came, and the crate was taken down.\r\n\r\n'You haven't seen nothing of that there runaway boy by chance?' said a\r\nnew voice--Joe's no doubt.\r\n\r\n'What boy?' said Mr. Miles.\r\n\r\n'Run away from school, Salisbury,' said Joe. 'Telegrams far and near, so\r\nthey be. Little varmint.'\r\n\r\n'I ain't seen no boys, not more'n ordinary,' said Mr. Miles. 'Thick as\r\nflies they be, here, there, and everywhere, drat 'em. Sixpence--Correct.\r\nSo long, Joe.'\r\n\r\nThe cart rattled away. Joe and the crate blundered out of hearing, and\r\nQuentin looked cautiously round the water-butt.\r\n\r\nThis was an adventure. But he was cooler now than he had been at\r\nstarting--his hot anger had died down. He would have been contented, he\r\ncould not help feeling, with a less adventurous adventure.\r\n\r\nBut he was in for it now. He felt, as I suppose people feel when they\r\njump off cliffs with parachutes, that return was impossible.\r\n\r\nHastily turning his school cap inside out--the only disguise he could\r\nthink of, he emerged from the water-butt seclusion and into the street,\r\ntrying to look as if there was no reason why he should not be there. He\r\ndid not know the village. It was not Lyndhurst. And of course asking the\r\nway was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nThere was a piece of sacking lying on the road; it must have dropped\r\nfrom the carrier's cart. He picked it up and put it over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n'A deeper disguise,' he said, and walked on.\r\n\r\nHe walked steadily for a long, long way as it seemed, and the world got\r\ndarker and darker. But he kept on. Surely he must presently come to some\r\nvillage, or some signpost.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, whatever happened, he could not go back. That was the one\r\ncertain thing. The broad stretches of country to right and left held no\r\nshapes of houses, no glimmer of warm candle-light; they were bare and\r\nbleak, only broken by circles of trees that stood out like black islands\r\nin the misty grey of the twilight.\r\n\r\n'I shall have to sleep behind a hedge,' he said bravely enough; but\r\nthere did not seem to be any hedges. And then, quite suddenly, he came\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nA scattered building, half transparent as it seemed, showing black\r\nagainst the last faint pink and primrose of the sunset. He stopped, took\r\na few steps off the road on short, crisp turf that rose in a gentle\r\nslope. And at the end of a dozen paces he knew it. Stonehenge!\r\nStonehenge he had always wanted so desperately to see. Well, he saw it\r\nnow, more or less.\r\n\r\nHe stopped to think. He knew that Stonehenge stands all alone on\r\nSalisbury Plain. He was very tired. His mother had told him about a girl\r\nin a book who slept all night on the altar stone at Stonehenge. So it\r\nwas a thing that people did--to sleep there. He was not afraid, as you\r\nor I might have been--of that lonely desolate ruin of a temple of long\r\nago. He was used to the forest, and, compared with the forest, any\r\nbuilding is homelike.\r\n\r\nThere was just enough light left amid the stones of the wonderful broken\r\ncircle to guide him to its centre. As he went his hand brushed a plant;\r\nhe caught at it, and a little group of flowers came away in his hand.\r\n\r\n'St. John's wort,' he said, 'that's the magic flower.' And he remembered\r\nthat it is only magic when you pluck it on Midsummer Eve.\r\n\r\n'And this _is_ Midsummer Eve,' he told himself, and put it in his\r\nbuttonhole.\r\n\r\n'I don't know where the altar stone is,' he said, 'but that looks a cosy\r\nlittle crack between those two big stones.'\r\n\r\nHe crept into it, and lay down on a flat stone that stretched between\r\nand under two fallen pillars.\r\n\r\nThe night was soft and warm; it was Midsummer Eve.\r\n\r\n'Mother isn't going till the twenty-sixth,' he told himself. 'I sha'n't\r\nbother about hotels. I shall send her a telegram in the morning, and get\r\na carriage at the nearest stables and go straight back to her. No, she\r\nwon't be angry when she hears all about it. I'll ask her to let me go to\r\nsea instead of to school. It's much more manly. Much more manly ... much\r\nmuch more, much.'\r\n\r\nHe was asleep. And the wild west wind that swept across the plain spared\r\nthe little corner where he lay asleep, curled up in his sacking with the\r\ninside-out school cap, doubled twice, for pillow.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep on the smooth, solid, steady stone.\r\n\r\nHe awoke on the stone in a world that rocked as sea-boats rock on a\r\nchoppy sea.\r\n\r\nHe went to sleep between fallen moveless pillars of a ruin older than\r\nany world that history knows.\r\n\r\nHe awoke in the shade of a purple awning through which strong sunlight\r\nfiltered, and purple curtains that flapped and strained in the wind; and\r\nthere was a smell, a sweet familiar smell, of tarred ropes and the sea.\r\n\r\n'I say,' said Quentin to himself, 'here's a rum go.'\r\n\r\nHe had learned that expression in a school in Salisbury, a long time ago\r\nas it seemed.\r\n\r\nThe stone on which he lay dipped and rose to a rhythm which he knew well\r\nenough. He had felt it when he and his mother went in a little boat from\r\nKeyhaven to Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight. There was no doubt in his\r\nmind. He was on a ship. But how, but why? Who could have carried him all\r\nthat way without waking him? Was it magic? Accidental magic? The St.\r\nJohn's wort perhaps? And the stone--it was not the same. It was new,\r\nclean cut, and, where the wind displaced a corner of the curtain,\r\ndazzlingly white in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThere was the pat pat of bare feet on the deck, a dull sort of shuffling\r\nas though people were arranging themselves. And then people outside the\r\nawning began to sing. It was a strange song, not at all like any music\r\nyou or I have ever heard. It had no tune, no more tune than a drum has,\r\nor a trumpet, but it had a sort of wild rough glorious exciting\r\nsplendour about it, and gave you the sort of intense all-alive feeling\r\nthat drums and trumpets give.\r\n\r\nQuentin lifted a corner of the purple curtain and looked out.\r\n\r\nInstantly the song stopped, drowned in the deepest silence Quentin had\r\never imagined. It was only broken by the flip-flapping of the sheets\r\nagainst the masts of the ship. For it was a ship, Quentin saw that as\r\nthe bulwark dipped to show him an unending waste of sea, broken by\r\nbigger waves than he had ever dreamed of. He saw also a crowd of men,\r\ndressed in white and blue and purple and gold. Their right arms were\r\nraised towards the sun, half of whose face showed across the sea--but\r\nthey seemed to be, as my old nurse used to say, 'struck so,' for their\r\neyes were not fixed on the sun, but on Quentin. And not in anger, he\r\nnoticed curiously, but with surprise and ... could it be that they were\r\nafraid of him?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'Who are you?' he said. 'Answer, I adjure you by the\r\nsacred Tau!']\r\n\r\nQuentin was shivering with the surprise and newness of it all. He had\r\nread about magic, but he had not wholly believed in it, and yet, now, if\r\nthis was not magic, what was it? You go to sleep on an old stone in a\r\nruin. You wake on the same stone, quite new, on a ship. Magic, magic, if\r\never there was magic in this wonderful, mysterious world!\r\n\r\nThe silence became awkward. Some one had to say something.\r\n\r\n'Good-morning,' said Quentin, feeling that he ought perhaps to be the\r\none.\r\n\r\nInstantly every one in sight fell on his face on the deck.\r\n\r\nOnly one, a tall man with a black beard and a blue mantle, stood up and\r\nlooked Quentin in the eyes.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' he said. 'Answer, I adjure you by the Sacred Tau!' Now\r\nthis was very odd, and Quentin could never understand it, but when this\r\nman spoke Quentin understood _him_ perfectly, and yet at the same time\r\nhe knew that the man was speaking a foreign language. So that his\r\nthought was not, 'Hullo, you speak English!' but 'Hullo, I can\r\nunderstand your language.'\r\n\r\n'I am Quentin de Ward,' he said.\r\n\r\n'A name from other stars! How came you here?' asked the blue-mantled\r\nman.\r\n\r\n'_I_ don't know,' said Quentin.\r\n\r\n'He does not know. He did not sail with us. It is by magic that he is\r\nhere,' said Blue Mantle. 'Rise, all, and greet the Chosen of the\r\nGods.'\r\n\r\nThey rose from the deck, and Quentin saw that they were all bearded\r\nmen, with bright, earnest eyes, dressed in strange dress of something\r\nlike jersey and tunic and heavy golden ornaments.\r\n\r\n'Hail! Chosen of the Gods,' cried Blue Mantle, who seemed to be the\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n'Hail, Chosen of the Gods!' echoed the rest.\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much, I'm sure,' said Quentin.\r\n\r\n'And what is this stone?' asked Blue Mantle, pointing to the stone on\r\nwhich Quentin sat.\r\n\r\nAnd Quentin, anxious to show off his knowledge, said:\r\n\r\n'I'm not quite sure, but I _think_ it's the altar stone of Stonehenge.'\r\n\r\n'It is proved,' said Blue Mantle. 'Thou art the Chosen of the Gods. Is\r\nthere anything my Lord needs?' he added humbly.\r\n\r\n'I ... I'm rather hungry,' said Quentin; 'it's a long time since dinner,\r\nyou know.'\r\n\r\nThey brought him bread and bananas, and oranges.\r\n\r\n'Take,' said Blue Mantle, 'of the fruits of the earth, and specially of\r\nthis, which gives drink and meat and ointment to man,' suddenly\r\noffering a large cocoa-nut.\r\n\r\nQuentin took, with appropriate 'Thank you's' and 'You're very kind's.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' said Blue Mantle, 'is too good for the Chosen of the Gods.\r\nAll that we have is yours, to the very last day of your life you have\r\nonly to command, and we obey. You will like to eat in seclusion. And\r\nafterwards you will let us behold the whole person of the Chosen of the\r\nGods.'\r\n\r\nQuentin retired into the purple tent, with the fruits and the cocoa-nut.\r\nAs you know, a cocoa-nut is not handy to get at the inside of, at the\r\nbest of times, so Quentin set that aside, meaning to ask Blue Mantle\r\nlater on for a gimlet and a hammer.\r\n\r\nWhen he had had enough to eat he peeped out again. Blue Mantle was on\r\nthe watch and came quickly forward.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said he, very crossly indeed, 'tell me how you got here. This\r\nChosen of the Gods business is all very well for the vulgar. But you and\r\nI know that there is no such thing as magic.'\r\n\r\n'Speak for yourself,' said Quentin. 'If I'm not here by magic I'm not\r\nhere at all.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you are,' said Blue Mantle.\r\n\r\n'I know I am,' said Quentin, 'but if I'm not here by magic what am I\r\nhere by?'\r\n\r\n'Stowawayishness,' said Blue Mantle.\r\n\r\n'If you think that why don't you treat me as a stowaway?'\r\n\r\n'Because of public opinion,' said Blue Mantle, rubbing his nose in an\r\nangry sort of perplexedness.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Quentin, who was feeling so surprised and bewildered\r\nthat it was a real relief to him to bully somebody. 'Now look here. I\r\ncame here by magic, accidental magic. I belong to quite a different\r\nworld from yours. But perhaps you are right about my being the Chosen of\r\nthe Gods. And I sha'n't tell you anything about my world. But I command\r\nyou, by the Sacred Tau' (he had been quick enough to catch and remember\r\nthe word), 'to tell me who you are, and where you come from, and where\r\nyou are going.'\r\n\r\nBlue Mantle shrugged his shoulders. 'Oh, well,' he said, 'if you invoke\r\nthe sacred names of Power.... But I don't call it fair play. Especially\r\nas you know perfectly well, and just want to browbeat me into telling\r\nlies. I shall not tell lies. I shall tell you the truth.'\r\n\r\n'I hoped you would,' said Quentin gently.\r\n\r\n'Well then,' said Blue Mantle, 'I am a Priest of Poseidon, and I come\r\nfrom the great and immortal kingdom of Atlantis.'\r\n\r\n'From the temple where the gold statue is, with the twelve sea-horses in\r\ngold?' Quentin asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Ah, I knew you knew all about it,' said Blue Mantle, 'so I don't need\r\nto tell you that I am taking the sacred stone, on which you are sitting\r\n(profanely if you are a mere stowaway, and not the Chosen of the Gods)\r\nto complete the splendid structure of a temple built on a great plain in\r\nthe second of the islands which are our colonies in the North East.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me all about Atlantis,' said Quentin. And the priest, protesting\r\nthat Quentin knew as much about it as he did, told.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the ship was ploughing through the waves, sometimes\r\nsailing, sometimes rowed by hidden rowers with long oars. And Quentin\r\nwas served in all things as though he had been a king. If he had\r\ninsisted that he was not the Chosen of the Gods everything might have\r\nbeen different. But he did not. And he was very anxious to show how much\r\nhe knew about Atlantis. And sometimes he was wrong, the Priest said, but\r\nmuch more often he was right.\r\n\r\n'We are less than three days' journey now from the Eastern Isles,' Blue\r\nMantle said one day, 'and I warn you that if you are a mere stowaway you\r\nhad better own it. Because if you persist in calling yourself the Chosen\r\nof the Gods you will be expected to act as such--to the very end.'\r\n\r\n'I don't call myself anything,' said Quentin, 'though I am not a\r\nstowaway, anyhow, and I don't know how I came here--so of course it was\r\nmagic. It's simply silly your being so cross. _I_ can't help being here.\r\nLet's be friends.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Blue Mantle, much less crossly, 'I never believed in magic,\r\nthough I _am_ a priest, but if it is, it is. We may as well be friends,\r\nas you call it. It isn't for very long, anyway,' he added mysteriously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The cart was drawn by an enormous creature, more like an\r\nelephant than anything else.]\r\n\r\nAnd then to show his friendliness he took Quentin all over the ship, and\r\nexplained it all to him. And Quentin enjoyed himself thoroughly, though\r\nevery now and then he had to pinch himself to make sure that he was\r\nawake. And he was fed well all the time, and all the time made much of,\r\nso that when the ship reached land he was quite sorry. The ship anchored\r\nby a stone quay, most solid and serviceable, and every one was very\r\nbusy.\r\n\r\nQuentin kept out of sight behind the purple curtains. The sailors and\r\nthe priests and the priests' attendants and everybody on the boat had\r\nasked him so many questions, and been so curious about his clothes, that\r\nhe was not anxious to hear any more questions asked, or to have to\r\ninvent answers to them.\r\n\r\nAnd after a very great deal of talk--almost as much as Mr. Miles's\r\ncarrying had needed--the altar stone was lifted, Quentin, curtains,\r\nawning and all, and carried along a gangway to the shore, and there it\r\nwas put on a sort of cart, more like what people in Manchester call a\r\nlurry than anything else I can think of. The wheels were made of solid\r\ncircles of wood bound round with copper. And the cart was drawn by--not\r\nhorses or donkeys or oxen or even dogs--but by an enormous creature more\r\nlike an elephant than anything else, only it had long hair rather like\r\nthe hair worn by goats.\r\n\r\nYou, perhaps, would not have known what this vast creature was, but\r\nQuentin, who had all sorts of out-of-the-way information packed in his\r\nhead, knew at once that it was a mammoth.\r\n\r\nAnd by that he knew, too, that he had slipped back many thousands of\r\nyears, because, of course, it is a very long time indeed since there\r\nwere any mammoths alive, and able to draw lurries. And the car and the\r\npriest and the priest's retinue and the stone and Quentin and the\r\nmammoth journeyed slowly away from the coast, passing through great\r\ngreen forests and among strange gray mountains.\r\n\r\nWhere were they journeying?\r\n\r\nQuentin asked the same question you may be sure, and Blue Mantle told\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n'To Stonehenge.' And Quentin understood him perfectly, though\r\nStonehenge was not the word Blue Mantle used, or anything like it.\r\n\r\n'The great temple is now complete,' he said, 'all but the altar stone.\r\nIt will be the most wonderful temple ever built in any of the colonies\r\nof Atlantis. And it will be consecrated on the longest day of the year.'\r\n\r\n'Midsummer Day,' said Quentin thoughtlessly--and, as usual, anxious to\r\ntell all he knew. 'I know. The sun strikes through the arch on to the\r\naltar stone at sunrise. Hundreds of people go to see it: the ruins are\r\nquite crowded sometimes, I believe.'\r\n\r\n'Ruins?' said the priest in a terrible voice. 'Crowded? Ruins?'\r\n\r\n'I mean,' said Quentin hastily, 'the sun will still shine the same way\r\neven when the temple is in ruins, won't it?'\r\n\r\n'The temple,' said the priest, 'is built to defy time. It will never be\r\nin ruins.'\r\n\r\n'That's all _you_ know,' said Quentin, not very politely.\r\n\r\n'It is not by any means all I know,' said the priest. 'I do not tell all\r\nI know. Nor do you.'\r\n\r\n'I used to,' said Quentin, 'but I sha'n't any more. It only leads to\r\ntrouble--I see that now.'\r\n\r\nNow, though Quentin had been intensely interested in everything he had\r\nseen in the ship and on the journey, you may be sure he had not lost\r\nsight of the need there was to get back out of this time of Atlantis\r\ninto his own time. He knew that he must have got into these Atlantean\r\ntimes by some very simple accidental magic, and he felt no doubt that he\r\nshould get back in the same way. He felt almost sure that the\r\nreverse-action, so to speak, of the magic would begin when the stone got\r\nback to the place where it had lain for so many thousand years before he\r\nhappened to go to sleep on it, and to start--perhaps by the St. John's\r\nwort--the accidental magic. If only, when he got back there he could\r\nthink of the compelling, the magic word!\r\n\r\nAnd now the slow procession wound over the downs, and far away across\r\nthe plain, which was almost just the same then as it is now, Quentin saw\r\nwhat he knew must be Stonehenge. But it was no longer the grey pile of\r\nruins that you have perhaps seen--or have, at any rate, seen pictures\r\nof.\r\n\r\nFrom afar one could see the gleam of yellow gold and red copper; the\r\nflutter of purple curtains, the glitter and dazzle of shimmering silver.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near to the spot Quentin perceived that the great stones he\r\nremembered were overlaid with ornamental work, with vivid,\r\nbright-coloured paintings. The whole thing was a great circular\r\nbuilding, every stone in its place. At a mile or two distant lay a town.\r\nAnd in that town, with every possible luxury, served with every\r\ncircumstance of servile homage, Quentin ate and slept.\r\n\r\nI wish I had time to tell you what that town was like where he slept and\r\nate, but I have not. You can read for yourself, some day, what Atlantis\r\nwas like. Plato tells us a good deal, and the Colonies of Atlantis must\r\nhave had at least a reasonable second-rate copy of the cities of that\r\nfair and lovely land.\r\n\r\nThat night, for the first time since he had first gone to sleep on the\r\naltar stone, Quentin slept apart from it. He lay on a wooden couch\r\nstrewn with soft bear-skins, and a woollen coverlet was laid over him.\r\nAnd he slept soundly.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night, as it seemed, Blue Mantle woke him.\r\n\r\n'Come,' he said, 'Chosen of the Gods--since you _will_ be that, and no\r\nstowaway--the hour draws nigh.'\r\n\r\nThe mammoth was waiting. Quentin and Blue Mantle rode on its back to the\r\nouter porch of the new temple of Stonehenge. Rows of priests and\r\nattendants, robed in white and blue and purple, formed a sort of avenue\r\nup which Blue Mantle led the Chosen of the Gods, who was Quentin. They\r\ntook off his jacket and put a white dress on him, rather like a\r\nnight-shirt without sleeves. And they put a thick wreath of London Pride\r\non his head and another, larger and longer, round his neck.\r\n\r\n'If only the chaps at school could see me now!' he said to himself\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\nAnd by this time it was gray dawn.\r\n\r\n'Lie down now,' said Blue Mantle, 'lie down, O Beloved of the Gods, upon\r\nthe altar stone, for the last time.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be able to go, then?' Quentin asked. This accidental magic was,\r\nhe perceived, a tricky thing, and he wanted to be sure.\r\n\r\n'You will not be able to stay,' said the priest. 'If going is what you\r\ndesire, the desire of the Chosen of the Gods is fully granted.'\r\n\r\nThe grass on the plain far and near rustled with the tread of many feet;\r\nthe cold air of dawn thrilled to the awed murmured of many voices.\r\n\r\nQuentin lay down, with his pink wreaths and his white robe, and watched\r\nthe quickening pinkiness of the East. And slowly the great circle of the\r\ntemple filled with white-robed folk, all carrying in their hands the\r\nfaint pinkiness of the flowers which we nowadays call London Pride.\r\n\r\nAnd all eyes were fixed on the arch through which, at sunrise on\r\nMidsummer Day, the sun's first beam should fall upon the white, new,\r\nclean altar stone. The stone is still there, after all these thousands\r\nof years, and at sunrise on Midsummer Day the sun's first ray still\r\nfalls on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'Silence,' cried the priest. 'Chosen of the Immortals,\r\nclose your eyes!']\r\n\r\nThe sky grew lighter and lighter, and at last the sun peered redly over\r\nthe down, and the first ray of the morning sunlight fell full on the\r\naltar stone and on the face of Quentin.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it did so, a very tall, white-robed priest with a deer-skin\r\napron and a curious winged head-dress stepped forward. He carried a\r\ngreat bronze knife, and he waved it ten times in the shaft of sunlight\r\nthat shot through the arch and on to the altar stone.\r\n\r\n'Thus,' he cried, 'thus do I bathe the sacred blade in the pure fountain\r\nof all light, all wisdom, all splendour. In the name of the ten kings,\r\nthe ten virtues, the ten hopes, the ten fears I make my weapon clean!\r\nMay this temple of our love and our desire endure for ever, so long as\r\nthe glory of our Lord the Sun is shed upon this earth. May the sacrifice\r\nI now humbly and proudly offer be acceptable to the gods by whom it has\r\nbeen so miraculously provided. Chosen of the Gods! return to the gods\r\nwho sent thee!'\r\n\r\nA roar of voices rang through the temple. The bronze knife was raised\r\nover Quentin. He could not believe that this, this horror, was the end\r\nof all these wonderful happenings.\r\n\r\n'No--no,' he cried, 'it's not true. I'm not the Chosen of the Gods! I'm\r\nonly a little boy that's got here by accidental magic!'\r\n\r\n'Silence,' cried the priest, 'Chosen of the Immortals, close your eyes!\r\nIt will not hurt. This life is only a dream; the other life is the real\r\nlife. Be strong, be brave!'\r\n\r\nQuentin was not brave. But he shut his eyes. He could not help it. The\r\nglitter of the bronze knife in the sunlight was too strong for him.\r\n\r\nHe could not believe that this could really have happened to him. Every\r\none had been so kind--so friendly to him. And it was all for this!\r\n\r\nSuddenly a sharp touch at his side told him that for this, indeed, it\r\nhad all been. He felt the point of the knife.\r\n\r\n'Mother!' he cried. And opened his eyes again.\r\n\r\nHe always felt quite sure afterwards that 'Mother' was the master-word,\r\nthe spell of spells. For when he opened his eyes there was no priest, no\r\nwhite-robed worshippers, no splendour of colour and metal, no Chosen of\r\nthe Gods, no knife--only a little boy with a piece of sacking over him,\r\ndamp with the night dews, lying on a stone amid the grey ruins of\r\nStonehenge, and, all about him, a crowd of tourists who had come to see\r\nthe sun's first shaft strike the age-old altar of Stonehenge on\r\nMidsummer Day in the morning. And instead of a knife point at his side\r\nthere was only the ferrule of the umbrella of an elderly and retired tea\r\nmerchant in a mackintosh and an Alpine hat,--a ferrule which had prodded\r\nthe sleeping boy so unexpectedly surprised on the very altar stone where\r\nthe sun's ray now lingered.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in a moment, he knew that he had not uttered the spell in\r\nvain, the word of compelling, the word of power: for his mother was\r\nthere kneeling beside him. I am sorry to say that he cried as he clung\r\nto her. _We_ cannot all of us be brave, always.\r\n\r\nThe tourists were very kind and interested, and the tea merchant\r\ninsisted on giving Quentin something out of a flask, which was so nasty\r\nthat Quentin only pretended to drink, out of politeness. His mother had\r\na carriage waiting, and they escaped to it while the tourists were\r\nsaying, 'How romantic!' and asking each other whatever in the world had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'But how _did_ you come to be there, darling?' said his mother with warm\r\nhands comfortingly round him. 'I've been looking for you all night. I\r\nwent to say good-bye to you yesterday--Oh, Quentin--and I found you'd\r\nrun away. How _could_ you?'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' said Quentin, 'if it worried you, I'm sorry. Very, very. I\r\nwas going to telegraph to-day.'\r\n\r\n'But where have you been? What have you been doing all night?' she\r\nasked, caressing him.\r\n\r\n'Is it only one night?' said Quentin. 'I don't know exactly what's\r\nhappened. It was accidental magic, I think, mother. I'm glad I thought\r\nof the right word to get back, though.' And then he told her all about\r\nit. She held him very tightly and let him talk.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she thought that a little boy to whom accidental magic happened\r\nall in a minute, like that, was not exactly the right little boy for\r\nthat excellent school in Salisbury. Anyhow she took him to Egypt with\r\nher to meet his father, and, on the way, they happened to see a doctor\r\nin London who said: 'Nerves' which is a poor name for accidental magic,\r\nand Quentin does not believe it means the same thing at all.\r\n\r\nQuentin's father is well now, and he has left the army, and father and\r\nmother and Quentin live in a jolly, little, old house in Salisbury, and\r\nQuentin is a 'day boy' at that very same school. He and Smithson minor\r\nare the greatest of friends. But he has never told Smithson minor about\r\nthe accidental magic. He has learned now, and learned very thoroughly,\r\nthat it is not always wise to tell all you know. If he had not owned\r\nthat he knew that it was the Stonehenge altar stone!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou may think that the accidental magic was all a dream, and that\r\nQuentin dreamed it because his mother had told him so much about\r\nAtlantis. But then, how do you account for his dreaming so much that his\r\nmother had never told him? You think that that part wasn't true, well,\r\nit may have been true for anything I know. And I am sure you don't know\r\nmore about it than I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS AND THE HEDGE-PIG\r\n\r\n\r\n'But I don't see what we're to _do_' said the Queen for the twentieth\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n'Whatever we do will end in misfortune,' said the King gloomily; 'you'll\r\nsee it will.'\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the honeysuckle arbour talking things over, while\r\nthe nurse walked up and down the terrace with the new baby in her arms.\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear,' said the poor Queen; 'I've not the slightest doubt I\r\nshall.'\r\n\r\nMisfortune comes in many ways, and you can't always know beforehand that\r\na certain way is the way misfortune will come by: but there are things\r\nmisfortune comes after as surely as night comes after day. For instance,\r\nif you let all the water boil away, the kettle will have a hole burnt in\r\nit. If you leave the bath taps running and the waste-pipe closed, the\r\nstairs of your house will, sooner or later, resemble Niagara. If you\r\nleave your purse at home, you won't have it with you when you want to\r\npay your tram-fare. And if you throw lighted wax matches at your muslin\r\ncurtains, your parent will most likely have to pay five pounds to the\r\nfire engines for coming round and blowing the fire out with a wet hose.\r\nAlso if you are a king and do not invite the wicked fairy to your\r\nchristening parties, she will come all the same. And if you do ask the\r\nwicked fairy, she will come, and in either case it will be the worse for\r\nthe new princess. So what is a poor monarch to do? Of course there is\r\none way out of the difficulty, and that is not to have a christening\r\nparty at all. But this offends all the good fairies, and then where are\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nAll these reflections had presented themselves to the minds of King\r\nOzymandias and his Queen, and neither of them could deny that they were\r\nin a most awkward situation. They were 'talking it over' for the\r\nhundredth time on the palace terrace where the pomegranates and\r\noleanders grew in green tubs and the marble balustrade is overgrown with\r\nroses, red and white and pink and yellow. On the lower terrace the royal\r\nnurse was walking up and down with the baby princess that all the fuss\r\nwas about. The Queen's eyes followed the baby admiringly.\r\n\r\n'The darling!' she said. 'Oh, Ozymandias, don't you sometimes wish we'd\r\nbeen poor people?'\r\n\r\n'Never!' said the King decidedly.\r\n\r\n'Well, I do,' said the Queen; 'then we could have had just you and me\r\nand your sister at the christening, and no fear of--oh! I've thought of\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\nThe King's patient expression showed that he did not think it likely\r\nthat she would have thought of anything useful; but at the first five\r\nwords his expression changed. You would have said that he pricked up his\r\nears, if kings had ears that could be pricked up. What she said was--\r\n\r\n'Let's have a secret christening.'\r\n\r\n'How?' asked the King.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was gazing in the direction of the baby with what is called a\r\n'far away look' in her eyes.\r\n\r\n'Wait a minute,' she said slowly. 'I see it all--yes--we'll have the\r\nparty in the cellars--you know they're splendid.'\r\n\r\n'My great-grandfather had them built by Lancashire men, yes,'\r\ninterrupted the King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the lower terrace the royal nurse was walking up and\r\ndown with the baby princess that all the fuss was about.]\r\n\r\n'We'll send out the invitations to look like bills. The baker's boy can\r\ntake them. He's a very nice boy. He made baby laugh yesterday when I was\r\nexplaining to him about the Standard Bread. We'll just put \"1 loaf 3. A\r\nremittance at your earliest convenience will oblige.\" That'll mean that\r\n1 person is invited for 3 o'clock, and on the back we'll write where and\r\nwhy in invisible ink. Lemon juice, you know. And the baker's boy shall\r\nbe told to ask to see the people--just as they do when they _really_\r\nmean earliest convenience--and then he shall just whisper: \"Deadly\r\nsecret. Lemon juice. Hold it to the fire,\" and come away. Oh, dearest,\r\ndo say you approve!'\r\n\r\nThe King laid down his pipe, set his crown straight, and kissed the\r\nQueen with great and serious earnestness.\r\n\r\n'You are a wonder,' he said. 'It is the very thing. But the baker's boy\r\nis very small. Can we trust him?'\r\n\r\n'He is nine,' said the Queen, 'and I have sometimes thought that he must\r\nbe a prince in disguise. He is so very intelligent.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen's plan was carried out. The cellars, which were really\r\nextraordinarily fine, were secretly decorated by the King's confidential\r\nman and the Queen's confidential maid and a few of _their_ confidential\r\nfriends whom they knew they could really trust. You would never have\r\nthought they were cellars when the decorations were finished. The walls\r\nwere hung with white satin and white velvet, with wreaths of white\r\nroses, and the stone floors were covered with freshly cut turf with\r\nwhite daisies, brisk and neat, growing in it.\r\n\r\nThe invitations were duly delivered by the baker's boy. On them was\r\nwritten in plain blue ink,\r\n\r\n                      'The Royal Bakeries\r\n                           1 loaf 3d.\r\n               An early remittance will oblige.'\r\n\r\nAnd when the people held the letter to the fire, as they were\r\nwhisperingly instructed to do by the baker's boy, they read in a faint\r\nbrown writing:--\r\n\r\n'King Ozymandias and Queen Eliza invite you to the christening of their\r\ndaughter Princess Ozyliza at three on Wednesday in the Palace cellars.\r\n\r\n'_P.S._--We are obliged to be very secret and careful because of wicked\r\nfairies, so please come disguised as a tradesman with a bill, calling\r\nfor the last time before it leaves your hands.'\r\n\r\nYou will understand by this that the King and Queen were not as well off\r\nas they could wish; so that tradesmen calling at the palace with that\r\nsort of message was the last thing likely to excite remark. But as most\r\nof the King's subjects were not very well off either, this was merely a\r\nbond between the King and his people. They could sympathise with each\r\nother, and understand each other's troubles in a way impossible to most\r\nkings and most nations.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine the excitement in the families of the people who were\r\ninvited to the christening party, and the interest they felt in their\r\ncostumes. The Lord Chief Justice disguised himself as a shoemaker; he\r\nstill had his old blue brief-bag by him, and a brief-bag and a boot-bag\r\nare very much alike. The Commander-in-Chief dressed as a dog's meat man\r\nand wheeled a barrow. The Prime Minister appeared as a tailor; this\r\nrequired no change of dress and only a slight change of expression. And\r\nthe other courtiers all disguised themselves perfectly. So did the good\r\nfairies, who had, of course, been invited first of all. Benevola, Queen\r\nof the Good Fairies, disguised herself as a moonbeam, which can go into\r\nany palace and no questions asked. Serena, the next in command, dressed\r\nas a butterfly, and all the other fairies had disguises equally pretty\r\nand tasteful.\r\n\r\nThe Queen looked most kind and beautiful, the King very handsome and\r\nmanly, and all the guests agreed that the new princess was the most\r\nbeautiful baby they had ever seen in all their born days.\r\n\r\nEverybody brought the most charming christening presents concealed\r\nbeneath their disguises. The fairies gave the usual gifts, beauty,\r\ngrace, intelligence, charm, and so on.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to be going better than well. But of course you know\r\nit wasn't. The Lord High Admiral had not been able to get a cook's dress\r\nlarge enough completely to cover his uniform; a bit of an epaulette had\r\npeeped out, and the wicked fairy, Malevola, had spotted it as he went\r\npast her to the palace back door, near which she had been sitting\r\ndisguised as a dog without a collar hiding from the police, and enjoying\r\nwhat she took to be the trouble the royal household were having with\r\ntheir tradesmen.\r\n\r\nMalevola almost jumped out of her dog-skin when she saw the glitter of\r\nthat epaulette.\r\n\r\n'Hullo?' she said, and sniffed quite like a dog. 'I must look into\r\nthis,' said she, and disguising herself as a toad, she crept unseen into\r\nthe pipe by which the copper emptied itself into the palace moat--for of\r\ncourse there was a copper in one of the palace cellars as there always\r\nis in cellars in the North Country.\r\n\r\nNow this copper had been a great trial to the decorators. If there is\r\nanything you don't like about your house, you can either try to conceal\r\nit or 'make a feature of it.' And as concealment of the copper was\r\nimpossible, it was decided to 'make it a feature' by covering it with\r\ngreen moss and planting a tree in it, a little apple tree all in bloom.\r\nIt had been very much admired.\r\n\r\nMalevola, hastily altering her disguise to that of a mole, dug her way\r\nthrough the earth that the copper was full of, got to the top and put\r\nout a sharp nose just as Benevola was saying in that soft voice which\r\nMalevola always thought so affected,--\r\n\r\n'The Princess shall love and be loved all her life long.'\r\n\r\n'So she shall,' said the wicked fairy, assuming her own shape amid the\r\nscreams of the audience. 'Be quiet, you silly cuckoo,' she said to the\r\nLord Chamberlain, whose screams were specially piercing, 'or I'll give\r\n_you_ a christening present too.'\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a dreadful silence. Only Queen Eliza, who had caught\r\nup the baby at Malevola's first word, said feebly,--\r\n\r\n'Oh, _don't_, dear Malevola.'\r\n\r\nAnd the King said, 'It isn't exactly a party, don't you know. Quite\r\ninformal. Just a few friends dropped in, eh, what?'\r\n\r\n'So I perceive,' said Malevola, laughing that dreadful laugh of hers\r\nwhich makes other people feel as though they would never be able to\r\nlaugh any more. 'Well, I've dropped in too. Let's have a look at the\r\nchild.'\r\n\r\nThe poor Queen dared not refuse. She tottered forward with the baby in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n'Humph!' said Malevola, 'your precious daughter will have beauty and\r\ngrace and all the rest of the tuppenny halfpenny rubbish those\r\nniminy-piminy minxes have given her. But she will be turned out of her\r\nkingdom. She will have to face her enemies without a single human being\r\nto stand by her, and she shall never come to her own again until she\r\nfinds----' Malevola hesitated. She could not think of anything\r\nsufficiently unlikely--'until she finds,' she repeated----\r\n\r\n'A thousand spears to follow her to battle,' said a new voice, 'a\r\nthousand spears devoted to her and to her alone.'\r\n\r\nA very young fairy fluttered down from the little apple tree where she\r\nhad been hiding among the pink and white blossom.\r\n\r\n'I am very young, I know,' she said apologetically, 'and I've only just\r\nfinished my last course of Fairy History. So I know that if a fairy\r\nstops more than half a second in a curse she can't go on, and some one\r\nelse may finish it for her. That is so, Your Majesty, isn't it?' she\r\nsaid, appealing to Benevola. And the Queen of the Fairies said Yes, that\r\nwas the law, only it was such an old one most people had forgotten it.\r\n\r\n'You think yourself very clever,' said Malevola, 'but as a matter of\r\nfact you're simply silly. That's the very thing I've provided against.\r\nShe _can't_ have any one to stand by her in battle, so she'll lose her\r\nkingdom and every one will be killed, and I shall come to the funeral.\r\nIt will be enormous,' she added rubbing her hands at the joyous thought.\r\n\r\n'If you've quite finished,' said the King politely, 'and if you're sure\r\nyou won't take any refreshment, may I wish you a very good afternoon?'\r\nHe held the door open himself, and Malevola went out chuckling. The\r\nwhole of the party then burst into tears.\r\n\r\n'Never mind,' said the King at last, wiping his eyes with the tails of\r\nhis ermine. 'It's a long way off and perhaps it won't happen after all.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut of course it did.\r\n\r\nThe King did what he could to prepare his daughter for the fight in\r\nwhich she was to stand alone against her enemies. He had her taught\r\nfencing and riding and shooting, both with the cross bow and the long\r\nbow, as well as with pistols, rifles, and artillery. She learned to dive\r\nand to swim, to run and to jump, to box and to wrestle, so that she grew\r\nup as strong and healthy as any young man, and could, indeed, have got\r\nthe best of a fight with any prince of her own age. But the few princes\r\nwho called at the palace did not come to fight the Princess, and when\r\nthey heard that the Princess had no dowry except the gifts of the\r\nfairies, and also what Malevola's gift had been, they all said they had\r\njust looked in as they were passing and that they must be going now,\r\nthank you. And went.\r\n\r\nAnd then the dreadful thing happened. The tradesmen, who had for years\r\nbeen calling for the last time before, etc., really decided to place the\r\nmatter in other hands. They called in a neighbouring king who marched\r\nhis army into Ozymandias's country, conquered the army--the soldiers'\r\nwages hadn't been paid for years--turned out the King and Queen, paid\r\nthe tradesmen's bills, had most of the palace walls papered with the\r\nreceipts, and set up housekeeping there himself.\r\n\r\nNow when this happened the Princess was away on a visit to her aunt, the\r\nEmpress of Oricalchia, half the world away, and there is no regular post\r\nbetween the two countries, so that when she came home, travelling with\r\na train of fifty-four camels, which is rather slow work, and arrived at\r\nher own kingdom, she expected to find all the flags flying and the bells\r\nringing and the streets decked in roses to welcome her home.\r\n\r\nInstead of which nothing of the kind. The streets were all as dull as\r\ndull, the shops were closed because it was early-closing day, and she\r\ndid not see a single person she knew.\r\n\r\nShe left the fifty-four camels laden with the presents her aunt had\r\ngiven her outside the gates, and rode alone on her own pet camel to the\r\npalace, wondering whether perhaps her father had not received the letter\r\nshe had sent on ahead by carrier pigeon the day before.\r\n\r\nAnd when she got to the palace and got off her camel and went in, there\r\nwas a strange king on her father's throne and a strange queen sat in her\r\nmother's place at his side.\r\n\r\n'Where's my father?' said the Princess, bold as brass, standing on the\r\nsteps of the throne. 'And what are you doing there?'\r\n\r\n'I might ask you that,' said the King. 'Who are you, anyway?'\r\n\r\n'I am the Princess Ozyliza,' said she.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've heard of you,' said the King. 'You've been expected for some\r\ntime. Your father's been evicted, so now you know. No, I can't give you\r\nhis address.'\r\n\r\nJust then some one came and whispered to the Queen that fifty-four\r\ncamels laden with silks and velvets and monkeys and parakeets and the\r\nrichest treasures of Oricalchia were outside the city gate. She put two\r\nand two together, and whispered to the King, who nodded and said:\r\n\r\n'I wish to make a new law.'\r\n\r\nEvery one fell flat on his face. The law is so much respected in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n'No one called Ozyliza is allowed to own property in this kingdom,' said\r\nthe King. 'Turn out that stranger.'\r\n\r\nSo the Princess was turned out of her father's palace, and went out and\r\ncried in the palace gardens where she had been so happy when she was\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nAnd the baker's boy, who was now the baker's young man, came by with the\r\nstandard bread and saw some one crying among the oleanders, and went to\r\nsay, 'Cheer up!' to whoever it was. And it was the Princess. He knew her\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Princess,' he said, 'cheer up! Nothing is ever so bad as it seems.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Baker's Boy,' said she, for she knew him too, 'how can I cheer up?\r\nI am turned out of my kingdom. I haven't got my father's address, and I\r\nhave to face my enemies without a single human being to stand by me.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Instantly a flight of winged arrows crossed the garden.]\r\n\r\n'That's not true, at any rate,' said the baker's boy, whose name was\r\nErinaceus, 'you've got me. If you'll let me be your squire, I'll follow\r\nyou round the world and help you to fight your enemies.'\r\n\r\n'You won't be let,' said the Princess sadly, 'but I thank you very much\r\nall the same.'\r\n\r\nShe dried her eyes and stood up.\r\n\r\n'I must go,' she said, 'and I've nowhere to go to.'\r\n\r\nNow as soon as the Princess had been turned out of the palace, the Queen\r\nsaid, 'You'd much better have beheaded her for treason.' And the King\r\nsaid, 'I'll tell the archers to pick her off as she leaves the grounds.'\r\n\r\nSo when she stood up, out there among the oleanders, some one on the\r\nterrace cried, 'There she is!' and instantly a flight of winged arrows\r\ncrossed the garden. At the cry Erinaceus flung himself in front of her,\r\nclasping her in his arms and turning his back to the arrows. The Royal\r\nArchers were a thousand strong and all excellent shots. Erinaceus felt a\r\nthousand arrows sticking into his back.\r\n\r\n'And now my last friend is dead,' cried the Princess. But being a very\r\nstrong princess, she dragged him into the shrubbery out of sight of the\r\npalace, and then dragged him into the wood and called aloud on Benevola,\r\nQueen of the Fairies, and Benevola came.\r\n\r\n'They've killed my only friend,' said the Princess, 'at least.... Shall\r\nI pull out the arrows?'\r\n\r\n'If you do,' said the Fairy, 'he'll certainly bleed to death.'\r\n\r\n'And he'll die if they stay in,' said the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Not necessarily,' said the Fairy; 'let me cut them a little shorter.'\r\nShe did, with her fairy pocket-knife. 'Now,' she said, 'I'll do what I\r\ncan, but I'm afraid it'll be a disappointment to you both. Erinaceus,'\r\nshe went on, addressing the unconscious baker's boy with the stumps of\r\nthe arrows still sticking in him, 'I command you, as soon as I have\r\nvanished, to assume the form of a hedge-pig. The hedge-pig,' she\r\nexclaimed to the Princess, 'is the only nice person who can live\r\ncomfortably with a thousand spikes sticking out of him. Yes, I know\r\nthere are porcupines, but porcupines are vicious and ill-mannered.\r\nGood-bye!'\r\n\r\nAnd with that she vanished. So did Erinaceus, and the Princess found\r\nherself alone among the oleanders; and on the green turf was a small and\r\nvery prickly brown hedge-pig.\r\n\r\n'Oh, dear!' she said, 'now I'm all alone again, and the baker's boy has\r\ngiven his life for mine, and mine isn't worth having.'\r\n\r\n'It's worth more than all the world,' said a sharp little voice at her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n'Oh, can you talk?' she said, quite cheered.\r\n\r\n'Why not?' said the hedge-pig sturdily; 'it's only the _form_ of the\r\nhedge-pig I've assumed. I'm Erinaceus inside, all right enough. Pick me\r\nup in a corner of your mantle so as not to prick your darling hands.'\r\n\r\n'You mustn't call names, you know,' said the Princess, 'even your\r\nhedge-pigginess can't excuse such liberties.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry, Princess,' said the hedge-pig, 'but I can't help it. Only\r\nhuman beings speak lies; all other creatures tell the truth. Now I've\r\ngot a hedge-pig's tongue it won't speak anything but the truth. And the\r\ntruth is that I love you more than all the world.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said the Princess thoughtfully, 'since you're a hedge-pig I\r\nsuppose you may love me, and I may love you. Like pet dogs or gold-fish.\r\nDear little hedge-pig, then!'\r\n\r\n'Don't!' said the hedge-pig, 'remember I'm the baker's boy in my mind\r\nand soul. My hedge-pigginess is only skin-deep. Pick me up, dearest of\r\nPrincesses, and let us go to seek our fortunes.'\r\n\r\n'I think it's my parents I ought to seek,' said the Princess.\r\n'However...'\r\n\r\nShe picked up the hedge-pig in the corner of her mantle and they went\r\naway through the wood.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night at a wood-cutter's cottage. The wood-cutter was\r\nvery kind, and made a nice little box of beech-wood for the hedge-pig to\r\nbe carried in, and he told the Princess that most of her father's\r\nsubjects were still loyal, but that no one could fight for him because\r\nthey would be fighting for the Princess too, and however much they might\r\nwish to do this, Malevola's curse assured them that it was impossible.\r\n\r\nSo the Princess put her hedge-pig in its little box and went on, looking\r\neverywhere for her father and mother, and, after more adventures than I\r\nhave time to tell you, she found them at last, living in quite a poor\r\nway in a semi-detached villa at Tooting. They were very glad to see her,\r\nbut when they heard that she meant to try to get back the kingdom, the\r\nKing said:\r\n\r\n'I shouldn't bother, my child, I really shouldn't. We are quite happy\r\nhere. I have the pension always given to Deposed Monarchs, and your\r\nmother is becoming a really economical manager.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen blushed with pleasure, and said, 'Thank you, dear. But if you\r\nshould succeed in turning that wicked usurper out, Ozyliza, I hope I\r\nshall be a better queen than I used to be. I am learning housekeeping at\r\nan evening class at the Crown-maker's Institute.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess kissed her parents and went out into the garden to think it\r\nover. But the garden was small and quite full of wet washing hung on\r\nlines. So she went into the road, but that was full of dust and\r\nperambulators. Even the wet washing was better than that, so she went\r\nback and sat down on the grass in a white alley of tablecloths and\r\nsheets, all marked with a crown in indelible ink. And she took the\r\nhedge-pig out of the box. It was rolled up in a ball, but she stroked\r\nthe little bit of soft forehead that you can always find if you look\r\ncarefully at a rolled-up hedge-pig, and the hedge-pig uncurled and said:\r\n\r\n'I am afraid I was asleep, Princess dear. Did you want me?'\r\n\r\n'You're the only person who knows all about everything,' said she. 'I\r\nhaven't told father and mother about the arrows. Now what do you\r\nadvise?'\r\n\r\nErinaceus was flattered at having his advice asked, but unfortunately he\r\nhadn't any to give.\r\n\r\n'It's your work, Princess,' he said. 'I can only promise to do anything\r\na hedge-pig _can_ do. It's not much. Of course I could die for you, but\r\nthat's so useless.'\r\n\r\n'Quite,' said she.\r\n\r\n'I wish I were invisible,' he said dreamily.\r\n\r\n'Oh, where are you?' cried Ozyliza, for the hedge-pig had vanished.\r\n\r\n'Here,' said a sharp little voice. 'You can't see me, but I can see\r\neverything I want to see. And I can see what to do. I'll crawl into my\r\nbox, and you must disguise yourself as an old French governess with the\r\nbest references and answer the advertisement that the wicked king put\r\nyesterday in the \"Usurpers Journal.\"'\r\n\r\nThe Queen helped the Princess to disguise herself, which, of course, the\r\nQueen would never have done if she had known about the arrows; and the\r\nKing gave her some of his pension to buy a ticket with, so she went back\r\nquite quickly, by train, to her own kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe usurping King at once engaged the French governess to teach his cook\r\nto read French cookery books, because the best recipes are in French. Of\r\ncourse he had no idea that there was a princess, _the_ Princess, beneath\r\nthe governessial disguise. The French lessons were from 6 to 8 in the\r\nmorning and from 2 to 4 in the afternoon, and all the rest of the time\r\nthe governess could spend as she liked. She spent it walking about the\r\npalace gardens and talking to her invisible hedge-pig. They talked about\r\neverything under the sun, and the hedge-pig was the best of company.\r\n\r\n'How did you become invisible?' she asked one day, and it said, 'I\r\nsuppose it was Benevola's doing. Only I think every one gets _one_ wish\r\ngranted if they only wish hard enough.'\r\n\r\nOn the fifty-fifth day the hedge-pig said, 'Now, Princess dear, I'm\r\ngoing to begin to get you back your kingdom.'\r\n\r\nAnd next morning the King came down to breakfast in a dreadful rage with\r\nhis face covered up in bandages.\r\n\r\n'This palace is haunted,' he said. 'In the middle of the night a\r\ndreadful spiked ball was thrown in my face. I lighted a match. There was\r\nnothing.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, 'Nonsense! You must have been dreaming.'\r\n\r\nBut next morning it was her turn to come down with a bandaged face. And\r\nthe night after, the King had the spiky ball thrown at him again. And\r\nthen the Queen had it. And then they both had it, so that they couldn't\r\nsleep at all, and had to lie awake with nothing to think of but their\r\nwickedness. And every five minutes a very little voice whispered:\r\n\r\n'Who stole the kingdom? Who killed the Princess?' till the King and\r\nQueen could have screamed with misery.\r\n\r\nAnd at last the Queen said, 'We needn't have killed the Princess.'\r\n\r\nAnd the King said, 'I've been thinking that, too.'\r\n\r\nAnd next day the King said, 'I don't know that we ought to have taken\r\nthis kingdom. We had a really high-class kingdom of our own.'\r\n\r\n'I've been thinking that too,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\nBy this time their hands and arms and necks and faces and ears were very\r\nsore indeed, and they were sick with want of sleep.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said the King, 'let's chuck it. Let's write to Ozymandias\r\nand tell him he can take over his kingdom again. I've had jolly well\r\nenough of this.'\r\n\r\n'Let's,' said the Queen, 'but we can't bring the Princess to life again.\r\nI do wish we could,' and she cried a little through her bandages into\r\nher egg, for it was breakfast time.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean that,' said a little sharp voice, though there was no one\r\nto be seen in the room. The King and Queen clung to each other in\r\nterror, upsetting the urn over the toast-rack.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean it?' said the voice again; 'answer, yes or no.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the Queen, 'I don't know who you are, but, yes, yes, yes. I\r\ncan't _think_ how we could have been so wicked.'\r\n\r\n'Nor I,' said the King.\r\n\r\n'Then send for the French governess,' said the voice.\r\n\r\n'Ring the bell, dear,' said the Queen. 'I'm sure what it says is right.\r\nIt is the voice of conscience. I've often heard _of_ it, but I never\r\nheard it before.'\r\n\r\nThe King pulled the richly-jewelled bell-rope and ten magnificent green\r\nand gold footmen appeared.\r\n\r\n'Please ask Mademoiselle to step this way,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe ten magnificent green and gold footmen found the governess beside\r\nthe marble basin feeding the gold-fish, and, bowing their ten green\r\nbacks, they gave the Queen's message. The governess who, every one\r\nagreed, was always most obliging, went at once to the pink satin\r\nbreakfast-room where the King and Queen were sitting, almost\r\nunrecognisable in their bandages.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Your Majesties?' said she curtseying.\r\n\r\n'The voice of conscience,' said the Queen, 'told us to send for you. Is\r\nthere any recipe in the French books for bringing shot princesses to\r\nlife? If so, will you kindly translate it for us?'\r\n\r\n'There is _one_,' said the Princess thoughtfully, 'and it is quite\r\nsimple. Take a king and a queen and the voice of conscience. Place them\r\nin a clean pink breakfast-room with eggs, coffee, and toast. Add a\r\nfull-sized French governess. The king and queen must be thoroughly\r\npricked and bandaged, and the voice of conscience must be very\r\ndistinct.'\r\n\r\n'Is that all?' asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n'That's all,' said the governess, 'except that the king and queen must\r\nhave two more bandages over their eyes, and keep them on till the voice\r\nof conscience has counted fifty-five very slowly.'\r\n\r\n'If you would be so kind,' said the Queen, 'as to bandage us with our\r\ntable napkins? Only be careful how you fold them, because our faces are\r\nvery sore, and the royal monogram is very stiff and hard owing to its\r\nbeing embroidered in seed pearls by special command.'\r\n\r\n'I will be very careful,' said the governess kindly.\r\n\r\nThe moment the King and Queen were blindfolded, the 'voice of\r\nconscience' began, 'one, two, three,' and Ozyliza tore off her\r\ndisguise, and under the fussy black-and-violet-spotted alpaca of the\r\nFrench governess was the simple slim cloth-of-silver dress of the\r\nPrincess. She stuffed the alpaca up the chimney and the grey wig into\r\nthe tea-cosy, and had disposed of the mittens in the coffee-pot and the\r\nelastic-side boots in the coal-scuttle, just as the voice of conscience\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n'Fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five!' and stopped.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen pulled off the bandages, and there, alive and well,\r\nwith bright clear eyes and pinky cheeks and a mouth that smiled, was the\r\nPrincess whom they supposed to have been killed by the thousand arrows\r\nof their thousand archers.\r\n\r\nBefore they had time to say a word the Princess said:\r\n\r\n'Good morning, Your Majesties. I am afraid you have had bad dreams. So\r\nhave I. Let us all try to forget them. I hope you will stay a little\r\nlonger in my palace. You are very welcome. I am so sorry you have been\r\nhurt.'\r\n\r\n'We deserved it,' said the Queen, 'and we want to say we have heard the\r\nvoice of conscience, and do please forgive us.'\r\n\r\n'Not another word,' said the Princess, '_do_ let me have some fresh tea\r\nmade. And some more eggs. These are quite cold. And the urn's been\r\nupset. We'll have a new breakfast. And I _am_ so sorry your faces are\r\nso sore.'\r\n\r\n'If you kissed them,' said the voice which the King and Queen called the\r\nvoice of conscience, 'their faces would not be sore any more.'\r\n\r\n'May I?' said Ozyliza, and kissed the King's ear and the Queen's nose,\r\nall she could get at through the bandages.\r\n\r\nAnd instantly they were quite well.\r\n\r\nThey had a delightful breakfast. Then the King caused the royal\r\nhousehold to assemble in the throne-room, and there announced that, as\r\nthe Princess had come to claim the kingdom, they were returning to their\r\nown kingdom by the three-seventeen train on Thursday.\r\n\r\nEvery one cheered like mad, and the whole town was decorated and\r\nilluminated that evening. Flags flew from every house, and the bells all\r\nrang, just as the Princess had expected them to do that day when she\r\ncame home with the fifty-five camels. All the treasure these had carried\r\nwas given back to the Princess, and the camels themselves were restored\r\nto her, hardly at all the worse for wear.\r\n\r\nThe usurping King and Queen were seen off at the station by the\r\nPrincess, and parted from her with real affection. You see they weren't\r\ncompletely wicked in their hearts, but they had never had time to think\r\nbefore. And being kept awake at night forced them to think. And the\r\n'voice of conscience' gave them something to think about.\r\n\r\nThey gave the Princess the receipted bills, with which most of the\r\npalace was papered, in return for board and lodging.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone a telegram was sent off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Ozymandias Rex, Esq.,\r\n                            Chatsworth,\r\n                                Delamere Road,\r\n                                    Tooting,\r\n                                        England.\r\n\r\n  Please come home at once. Palace vacant. Tenants have\r\n  left.--Ozyliza P.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they came immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived the Princess told them the whole story, and they\r\nkissed and praised her, and called her their deliverer and the saviour\r\nof her country.\r\n\r\n'_I_ haven't done anything,' she said. 'It was Erinaceus who did\r\neverything, and....'\r\n\r\n'But the fairies said,' interrupted the King, who was never clever at\r\nthe best of times, 'that you couldn't get the kingdom back till you had\r\na thousand spears devoted to you, to you alone.'\r\n\r\n'There are a thousand spears in my back,' said a little sharp voice,\r\n'and they are all devoted to the Princess and to her alone.'\r\n\r\n'Don't!' said the King irritably. 'That voice coming out of nothing\r\nmakes me jump.'\r\n\r\n'I can't get used to it either,' said the Queen. 'We must have a gold\r\ncage built for the little animal. But I must say I wish it was visible.'\r\n\r\n'So do I,' said the Princess earnestly. And instantly it was. I suppose\r\nthe Princess wished it very hard, for there was the hedge-pig with its\r\nlong spiky body and its little pointed face, its bright eyes, its small\r\nround ears, and its sharp, turned-up nose.\r\n\r\nIt looked at the Princess but it did not speak.\r\n\r\n'Say something _now_,' said Queen Eliza. 'I should like to _see_ a\r\nhedge-pig speak.'\r\n\r\n'The truth is, if speak I must, I must speak the truth,' said Erinaceus.\r\n'The Princess has thrown away her life-wish to make me visible. I wish\r\nshe had wished instead for something nice for herself.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, was that my life-wish?' cried the Princess. 'I didn't know, dear\r\nHedge-pig, I didn't know. If I'd only known, I would have wished you\r\nback into your proper shape.'\r\n\r\n'If you had,' said the hedge-pig, 'it would have been the shape of a\r\ndead man. Remember that I have a thousand spears in my back, and no man\r\ncan carry those and live.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess burst into tears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'I would kiss you on every one of your thousand spears,'\r\nshe said, 'to give you what you wish.']\r\n\r\n'Oh, you can't go on being a hedge-pig for ever,' she said, 'it's not\r\nfair. I can't bear it. Oh Mamma! Oh Papa! Oh Benevola!'\r\n\r\nAnd there stood Benevola before them, a little dazzling figure with blue\r\nbutterfly's wings and a wreath of moonshine.\r\n\r\n'Well?' she said, 'well?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you know,' said the Princess, still crying. 'I've thrown away my\r\nlife-wish, and he's still a hedge-pig. Can't you do _anything_!'\r\n\r\n'_I_ can't,' said the Fairy, 'but you can. Your kisses are magic kisses.\r\nDon't you remember how you cured the King and Queen of all the wounds\r\nthe hedge-pig made by rolling itself on to their faces in the night?'\r\n\r\n'But she can't go kissing hedge-pigs,' said the Queen, 'it would be most\r\nunsuitable. Besides it would hurt her.'\r\n\r\nBut the hedge-pig raised its little pointed face, and the Princess took\r\nit up in her hands. She had long since learned how to do this without\r\nhurting either herself or it. She looked in its little bright eyes.\r\n\r\n'I would kiss you on every one of your thousand spears,' she said, 'to\r\ngive you what you wish.'\r\n\r\n'Kiss me once,' it said, 'where my fur is soft. That is all I wish, and\r\nenough to live and die for.'\r\n\r\nShe stooped her head and kissed it on its forehead where the fur is\r\nsoft, just where the prickles begin.\r\n\r\nAnd instantly she was standing with her hands on a young man's shoulders\r\nand her lips on a young man's face just where the hair begins and the\r\nforehead leaves off. And all round his feet lay a pile of fallen arrows.\r\n\r\nShe drew back and looked at him.\r\n\r\n'Erinaceus,' she said, 'you're different--from the baker's boy I mean.'\r\n\r\n'When I was an invisible hedge-pig,' he said, 'I knew everything. Now I\r\nhave forgotten all that wisdom save only two things. One is that I am a\r\nking's son. I was stolen away in infancy by an unprincipled baker, and I\r\nam really the son of that usurping King whose face I rolled on in the\r\nnight. It is a painful thing to roll on your father's face when you are\r\nall spiky, but I did it, Princess, for your sake, and for my father's\r\ntoo. And now I will go to him and tell him all, and ask his\r\nforgiveness.'\r\n\r\n'You won't go away?' said the Princess. 'Ah! don't go away. What shall I\r\ndo without my hedge-pig?'\r\n\r\nErinaceus stood still, looking very handsome and like a prince.\r\n\r\n'What is the other thing that you remember of your hedge-pig wisdom?'\r\nasked the Queen curiously. And Erinaceus answered, not to her but to the\r\nPrincess:\r\n\r\n'The other thing, Princess, is that I love you.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't there a third thing, Erinaceus?' said the Princess, looking down.\r\n\r\n'There is, but you must speak that, not I.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said the Princess, a little disappointed, 'then you knew that I\r\nloved you?'\r\n\r\n'Hedge-pigs are very wise little beasts,' said Erinaceus, 'but I only\r\nknew that when you told it me.'\r\n\r\n'I--told you?'\r\n\r\n'When you kissed my little pointed face, Princess,' said Erinaceus, 'I\r\nknew then.'\r\n\r\n'My goodness gracious me,' said the King.\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' said Benevola, 'and I wouldn't ask _any one_ to the\r\nwedding.'\r\n\r\n'Except you, dear,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\n'Well, as I happened to be passing ... there's no time like the\r\npresent,' said Benevola briskly. 'Suppose you give orders for the\r\nwedding bells to be rung now, at once!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSEPTIMUS SEPTIMUSSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was screaming over the marsh. It shook the shutters and rattled\r\nthe windows, and the little boy lay awake in the bare attic. His mother\r\ncame softly up the ladder stairs shading the flame of the tallow candle\r\nwith her hand.\r\n\r\n'I'm not asleep, mother,' said he. And she heard the tears in his voice.\r\n\r\n'Why, silly lad,' she said, sitting down on the straw-bed beside him and\r\nputting the candle on the floor, 'what are you crying for?'\r\n\r\n'It's the wind keeps calling me, mother,' he said. 'It won't let me\r\nalone. It never has since I put up the little weather-cock for it to\r\nplay with. It keeps saying, \"Wake up, Septimus Septimusson, wake up,\r\nyou're the seventh son of a seventh son. You can see the fairies and\r\nhear the beasts speak, and you must go out and seek your fortune.\" And\r\nI'm afraid, and I don't want to go.'\r\n\r\n'I should think not indeed,' said his mother. 'The wind doesn't talk,\r\nSep, not really. You just go to sleep like a good boy, and I'll get\r\nfather to bring you a gingerbread pig from the fair to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nBut Sep lay awake a long time listening to what the wind really did keep\r\non saying, and feeling ashamed to think how frightened he was of going\r\nout all alone to seek his fortune--a thing all the boys in books were\r\nonly too happy to do.\r\n\r\nNext evening father brought home the loveliest gingerbread pig with\r\ncurrant eyes. Sep ate it, and it made him less anxious than ever to go\r\nout into the world where, perhaps, no one would give him gingerbread\r\npigs ever any more.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to bed he ran down to the shore where a great new harbour\r\nwas being made. The workmen had been blasting the big rocks, and on one\r\nof the rocks a lot of mussels were sticking. He stood looking at them,\r\nand then suddenly he heard a lot of little voices crying, 'Oh Sep, we're\r\nso frightened, we're choking.'\r\n\r\nThe voices were thin and sharp as the edges of mussel shells. They were\r\nindeed the voices of the mussels themselves.\r\n\r\n'Oh dear,' said Sep, 'I'm so sorry, but I can't move the rock back into\r\nthe sea, you know. Can I now?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said the mussels, 'but if you speak to the wind,--you know his\r\nlanguage and he's very fond of you since you made that toy for\r\nhim,--he'll blow the sea up till the waves wash us back into deep\r\nwater.'\r\n\r\n'But I'm afraid of the wind,' said Sep, 'it says things that frighten\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'Oh very well,' said the mussels, 'we don't want you to be afraid. We\r\ncan die all right if necessary.'\r\n\r\nThen Sep shivered and trembled.\r\n\r\n'Go away,' said the thin sharp voices. 'We'll die--but we'd rather die\r\nin our own brave company.'\r\n\r\n'I know I'm a coward,' said Sep. 'Oh, wait a minute.'\r\n\r\n'Death won't wait,' said the little voices.\r\n\r\n'I can't speak to the wind, I won't,' said Sep, and almost at the same\r\nmoment he heard himself call out, 'Oh wind, please come and blow up the\r\nwaves to save the poor mussels.'\r\n\r\nThe wind answered with a boisterous shout--\r\n\r\n'All right, my boy,' it shrieked, 'I'm coming.' And come it did. And\r\nwhen it had attended to the mussels it came and whispered to Sep in his\r\nattic. And to his great surprise, instead of covering his head with the\r\nbed-clothes, as usual, and trying not to listen, he found himself\r\nsitting up in bed and talking to the wind, man to man.\r\n\r\n'Why,' he said, 'I'm not afraid of you any more.'\r\n\r\n'Of course not, we're friends now,' said the wind. 'That's because we\r\njoined together to do a kindness to some one. There's nothing like that\r\nfor making people friends.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Sep.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the wind, 'and now, old chap, when will you go out and seek\r\nyour fortune? Remember how poor your father is, and the fortune, if you\r\nfind it, won't be just for you, but for your father and mother and the\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Sep, 'I didn't think of that.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the wind, 'really, my dear fellow, I do hate to bother you,\r\nbut it's better to fix a time. Now when shall we start?'\r\n\r\n'We?' said Sep. 'Are you going with me?'\r\n\r\n'I'll see you a bit of the way,' said the wind. 'What do you say now?\r\nShall we start to-night? There's no time like the present.'\r\n\r\n'I do hate going,' said Sep.\r\n\r\n'Of course you do!' said the wind, cordially. 'Come along. Get into your\r\nthings, and we'll make a beginning.'\r\n\r\nSo Sep dressed, and he wrote on his slate in very big letters, 'Gone to\r\nseek our fortune,' and he put it on the table so that his mother should\r\nsee it when she came down in the morning. And he went out of the cottage\r\nand the wind kindly shut the door after him.\r\n\r\nThe wind gently pushed him down to the shore, and there he got into his\r\nfather's boat, which was called the _Septimus and Susie_, after his\r\nfather and mother, and the wind carried him across to another country\r\nand there he landed.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said the wind, clapping him on the back, 'off you go, and good\r\nluck to you!'\r\n\r\nAnd it turned round and took the boat home again.\r\n\r\nWhen Sep's mother found the writing on the slate, and his father found\r\nthe boat gone they feared that Sep was drowned, but when the wind\r\nbrought the boat back wrong way up, they were quite sure, and they both\r\ncried for many a long day.\r\n\r\nThe wind tried to tell them that Sep was all right, but they couldn't\r\nunderstand wind-talk, and they only said, 'Drat the wind,' and fastened\r\nthe shutters up tight, and put wedges in the windows.\r\n\r\nSep walked along the straight white road that led across the new\r\ncountry. He had no more idea how to look for _his_ fortune than you\r\nwould have if you suddenly left off reading this and went out of your\r\nfront door to seek _yours_.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had made a start, and that is always something. When he had\r\ngone exactly seven miles on that straight foreign road, between strange\r\ntrees, and bordered with flowers he did not know the names of, he heard\r\na groaning in the wood, and some one sighing and saying, 'Oh, how hard\r\nit is, to have to die and never see my wife and the little cubs again.'\r\n\r\nThe voice was rough as a lion's mane, and strong as a lion's claws, and\r\nSep was very frightened. But he said, 'I'm not afraid,' and then oddly\r\nenough he found he had spoken the truth--he wasn't afraid.\r\n\r\nHe broke through the bushes and found that the person who had spoken was\r\nindeed a lion. A javelin had pierced its shoulder and fastened it to a\r\ngreat tree.\r\n\r\n'All right,' cried Sep, 'hold still a minute, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe got out his knife and cut and cut at the shaft of the javelin till he\r\nwas able to break it off. Then the lion drew back and the broken shaft\r\npassed through the wound and the broken javelin was left sticking in the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n'I'm really extremely obliged, my dear fellow,' said the lion warmly.\r\n'Pray command me, if there's any little thing I can do for you at any\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n'Don't mention it,' said Sep with proper politeness, 'delighted to have\r\nbeen of use to you, I'm sure.'\r\n\r\nSo they parted. As Sep scrambled through the bushes back to the road he\r\nkicked against an axe that lay on the ground.\r\n\r\n'Hullo,' said he, 'some poor woodman's dropped this, and not been able\r\nto find it. I'll take it along--perhaps I may meet him.'\r\n\r\nHe was getting very tired and very hungry, and presently he sat down to\r\nrest under a chestnut-tree, and he heard two little voices talking in\r\nthe branches, voices soft as a squirrel's fur, and bright as a\r\nsquirrel's eyes. They were, indeed, the voices of two squirrels.\r\n\r\n'Hush,' said one, 'there's some one below.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said the other, 'it's a horrid boy. Let's scurry away.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not a horrid boy,' said Sep. 'I'm the seventh son of a seventh\r\nson.'\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said Mrs. Squirrel, 'of course that makes all the difference. Have\r\nsome nuts?'\r\n\r\n'Rather,' said Sep. 'At least I mean, yes, if you please.'\r\n\r\nSo the squirrels brought nuts down to him, and when he had eaten as many\r\nas he wanted they filled his pockets, and then in return he chopped all\r\nthe lower boughs off the chestnut-tree, so that boys who were _not_\r\nseventh sons could not climb up and interfere with the squirrels'\r\nhousekeeping arrangements.\r\n\r\nThen they parted, the best of friends, and Sep went on.\r\n\r\n'I haven't found my fortune yet,' said he, 'but I've made a friend or\r\ntwo.'\r\n\r\nAnd just as he was saying that, he turned a corner of the road and met\r\nan old gentleman in a fur-lined coat riding a fine, big, grey horse.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!' said the gentleman. 'Who are you, and where are you off to so\r\nbright and early?'\r\n\r\n'I'm Septimus Septimusson,' said Sep, 'and I'm going to seek my\r\nfortune.'\r\n\r\n'And you've taken an axe to help you carve your way to glory?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Sep, 'I found it, and I suppose some one lost it. So I'm\r\nbringing it along in case I meet him.'\r\n\r\n'Heavy, isn't it?' said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Sep.\r\n\r\n'Then I'll carry it for you,' said the old gentleman, 'for it's one that\r\nmy head forester lost yesterday. And now come along with me, for you're\r\nthe boy I've been looking for for seven years--an honest boy and the\r\nseventh son of a seventh son.'\r\n\r\nSo Sep went home with the gentleman, who was a great lord in that\r\ncountry, and he lived in that lord's castle and was taught everything\r\nthat a gentleman ought to know. And in return he told the lord all about\r\nthe ways of birds and beasts--for as he understood their talk he knew\r\nmore about them than any one else in that country. And the lord wrote it\r\nall down in a book, and half the people said it was wonderfully clever,\r\nand the other half said it was nonsense, and how could he know. This was\r\nfame, and the lord was very pleased. But though the old lord was so\r\nfamous he would not leave his castle, for he had a hump that an\r\nenchanter had fastened on to him, and he couldn't bear to be seen with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'But you'll get rid of it for me some day, my boy,' he used to say. 'No\r\none but the seventh son of a seventh son and an honest boy can do it. So\r\nall the doctors say.'\r\n\r\nSo Sep grew up. And when he was twenty-one--straight as a lance and\r\nhandsome as a picture--the old lord said to him.\r\n\r\n'My boy, you've been like a son to me, but now it's time you got married\r\nand had sons of your own. Is there any girl you'd like to marry?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Sep, 'I never did care much for girls.'\r\n\r\nThe old lord laughed.\r\n\r\n'Then you must set out again and seek your fortune once more,' he said,\r\n'because no man has really found his fortune till he's found the lady\r\nwho is his heart's lady. Choose the best horse in the stable, and off\r\nyou go, lad, and my blessing go with you.'\r\n\r\nSo Sep chose a good red horse and set out, and he rode straight to the\r\ngreat city, that shone golden across the plain, and when he got there he\r\nfound every one crying.\r\n\r\n'Why, whatever is the matter?' said Sep, reining in the red horse in\r\nfront of a smithy, where the apprentices were crying on to the fires,\r\nand the smith was dropping tears on the anvil.\r\n\r\n'Why the Princess is dying,' said the blacksmith blowing his nose. 'A\r\nnasty, wicked magician--he had a spite against the King, and he got at\r\nthe Princess when she was playing ball in the garden, and now she's\r\nblind and deaf and dumb. And she won't eat.'\r\n\r\n'And she'll die,' said the first apprentice.\r\n\r\n'And she _is_ such a dear,' said the other apprentice.\r\n\r\nSep sat still on the red horse thinking.\r\n\r\n'Has anything been done?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' said the blacksmith. 'All the doctors have seen her, but they\r\ncan't do anything. And the King has advertised in the usual way, that\r\nany one who can cure her may marry her. But it's no good. King's sons\r\naren't what they used to be. A silly lot they are nowadays, all taken up\r\nwith football and cricket and golf.'\r\n\r\n'Humph,' said Sep, 'thank you. Which is the way to the palace?'\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith pointed, and then burst into tears again. Sep rode on.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to the palace he asked to see the King. Every one there was\r\ncrying too, from the footman who opened the door to the King, who was\r\nsitting upon his golden throne and looking at his fine collection of\r\nbutterflies through floods of tears.\r\n\r\n'Oh dear me yes, young man,' said the King, 'you may _see_ her and\r\nwelcome, but it's no good.'\r\n\r\n'We can but try,' said Sep. So he was taken to the room where the\r\nPrincess sat huddled up on her silver throne among the white velvet\r\ncushions with her crown all on one side, crying out of her poor blind\r\neyes, so that the tears ran down over her green gown with the red roses\r\non it.\r\n\r\nAnd directly he saw her he knew that she was the only girl, Princess as\r\nshe was, with a crown and a throne, who could ever be his heart's lady.\r\nHe went up to her and kneeled at her side and took her hand and kissed\r\nit. The Princess started. She could not see or hear him, but at the\r\ntouch of his hand and his lips she knew that he was her heart's lord,\r\nand she threw her arms round his neck, and cried more than ever.\r\n\r\nHe held her in his arms and stroked her hair till she stopped crying,\r\nand then he called for bread and milk. This was brought in a silver\r\nbasin, and he fed her with it as you feed a little child.\r\n\r\nThe news ran through the city, 'The Princess has eaten,' and all the\r\nbells were set ringing. Sep said good-night to his Princess and went to\r\nbed in the best bedroom of the palace. Early in the grey morning he got\r\nup and leaned out of the open window and called to his old friend the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nAnd the wind came bustling in and clapped him on the back, crying,\r\n'Well, my boy, and what can I do for you? Eh?'\r\n\r\nSep told him all about the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said the wind, 'you've not done so badly. At any rate you've got\r\nher love. And you couldn't have got that with anybody's help but your\r\nown. Now, of course, the thing to do is to find the wicked Magician.'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said Sep.\r\n\r\n'Well--I travel a good deal--I'll keep my eyes open, and let you know\r\nif I hear anything.'\r\n\r\nSep spent the day holding the Princess's hand, and feeding her at meal\r\ntimes; and that night the wind rattled his window and said, 'Let me in.'\r\n\r\nIt came in very noisily, and said, 'Well, I've found your Magician, he's\r\nin the forest pretending to be a mole.'\r\n\r\n'How can I find him?' said Sep.\r\n\r\n'Haven't you any friends in the forest?' asked the wind.\r\n\r\nThen Sep remembered his friends the squirrels, and he mounted his horse\r\nand rode away to the chestnut-tree where they lived. They were charmed\r\nto see him grown so tall and strong and handsome, and when he had told\r\nthem his story they said at once--\r\n\r\n'Oh yes! delighted to be of any service to you.' And they called to all\r\ntheir little brothers and cousins, and uncles and nephews to search the\r\nforest for a mole that wasn't really a mole, and quite soon they found\r\nhim, and hustled and shoved him along till he was face to face with Sep,\r\nin a green glade. The glade was green, but all the bushes and trees\r\naround were red-brown with squirrel fur, and shining bright with\r\nsquirrel eyes.\r\n\r\nThen Sep said, 'Give the Princess back her eyes and her hearing and her\r\nvoice.'\r\n\r\nBut the mole would not.\r\n\r\n'Give the Princess back her eyes and her hearing and her voice,' said\r\nSep again. But the mole only gnashed his wicked teeth and snarled.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a minute the squirrels fell on the mole and killed it, and\r\nSep thanked them and rode back to the palace, for, of course, he knew\r\nthat when a magician is killed, all his magic unworks itself instantly.\r\n\r\nBut when he got to his Princess she was still as deaf as a post and as\r\ndumb as a stone, and she was still crying bitterly with her poor blind\r\neyes, till the tears ran down her grass-green gown with the red roses on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'Cheer up, my sweetheart,' he said, though he knew she couldn't hear\r\nhim, and as he spoke the wind came in at the open window, and spoke very\r\nsoftly, because it was in the presence of the Princess.\r\n\r\n'All right,' it whispered, 'the old villain gave us the slip that\r\njourney. Got out of the mole-skin in the very nick of time. He's a wild\r\nboar now.'\r\n\r\n'Come,' said Sep, fingering his sword-hilt, 'I'll kill that myself\r\nwithout asking it any questions.'\r\n\r\nSo he went and fought it. But it was a most uncommon boar, as big as a\r\nhorse, with tusks half a yard long; and although Sep wounded it it\r\njerked the sword out of his hand with its tusk, and was just going to\r\ntrample him out of life with its hard, heavy pigs'-feet, when a great\r\nroar sounded through the forest.\r\n\r\n'Ah! would ye?' said the lion, and fastened teeth and claws in the great\r\nboar's back. The boar turned with a scream of rage, but the lion had got\r\na good grip, and it did not loosen teeth or claws till the boar lay\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n'Is he dead?' asked Sep when he came to himself.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, he's _dead_ right enough,' said the lion; but the wind came up\r\npuffing and blowing, and said:\r\n\r\n'It's no good, he's got away again, and now he's a fish. I was just a\r\nminute too late to see _what_ fish. An old oyster told me about it, only\r\nhe hadn't the wit to notice what particular fish the scoundrel changed\r\ninto.'\r\n\r\nSo then Sep went back to the palace, and he said to the King:\r\n\r\n'Let me marry the dear Princess, and we'll go out and seek our fortune.\r\nI've got to kill that Magician, and I'll do it too, or my name's not\r\nSeptimus Septimusson. But it may take years and years, and I can't be\r\naway from the Princess all that time, because she won't eat unless I\r\nfeed her. You see the difficulty, Sire?'\r\n\r\nThe King saw it. And that very day Sep was married to the Princess in\r\nher green gown with the red roses on it, and they set out together.\r\n\r\nThe wind went with them, and the wind, or something else, seemed to say\r\nto Sep, 'Go home, take your wife home to your mother.'\r\n\r\nSo he did. He crossed the land and he crossed the sea, and he went up\r\nthe red-brick path to his father's cottage, and he peeped in at the door\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n'Father, mother, here's my wife.'\r\n\r\nThey were so pleased to see him--for they had thought him dead, that\r\nthey didn't notice the Princess at first, and when they did notice her\r\nthey wondered at her beautiful face and her beautiful gown--but it\r\nwasn't till they had all settled down to supper--boiled rabbit it\r\nwas--and they noticed Sep feeding his wife as one feeds a baby that they\r\nsaw that she was blind.\r\n\r\nAnd then all the story had to be told.\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' said the fisherman, 'you and your wife bide here with us.\r\nI daresay I'll catch that old sinner in my nets one of these fine days.'\r\nBut he never did. And Sep and his wife lived with the old people. And\r\nthey were happy after a fashion--but of an evening Sep used to wander\r\nand wonder, and wonder and wander by the sea-shore, wondering as he\r\nwandered whether he wouldn't ever have the luck to catch that fish.\r\n\r\nAnd one evening as he wandered wondering he heard a little, sharp, thin\r\nvoice say:\r\n\r\n'Sep. I've got it.'\r\n\r\n'What?' asked Sep, forgetting his manners.\r\n\r\n'I've got it,' said a big mussel on a rock close by him, 'the magic\r\nstone that the Magician does his enchantments with. He dropped it out of\r\nhis mouth and I shut my shells on it--and now he's sweeping up and down\r\nthe sea like a mad fish, looking for it--for he knows he can never\r\nchange into anything else unless he gets it back. Here, take the nasty\r\nthing, it's making me feel quite ill.'\r\n\r\nIt opened its shells wide, and Sep saw a pearl. He reached out his hand\r\nand took it.\r\n\r\n'That's better,' said the mussel, washing its shells out with salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n'Can _I_ do magic with it?' Sep eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n'No,' said the mussel sadly, 'it's of no use to any one but the owner.\r\nNow, if I were you, I'd get into a boat, and if your friend the wind\r\nwill help us, I believe we really can do the trick.'\r\n\r\n'I'm at your service, of course,' said the wind, getting up instantly.\r\n\r\nThe mussel whispered to the wind, who rushed off at once; and Sep\r\nlaunched his boat.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said the mussel, 'you get into the very middle of the sea--or as\r\nnear as you can guess it. The wind will warn all the other fishes.' As\r\nhe spoke he disappeared in the dark waters.\r\n\r\nSep got the boat into the middle of the sea--as near as he could guess\r\nit--and waited.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time he saw something swirling about in a sort of whirlpool\r\nabout a hundred yards from his boat, but when he tried to move the boat\r\ntowards it her bows ran on to something hard.\r\n\r\n'Keep still, keep still, keep still,' cried thousands and thousands of\r\nsharp, thin, little voices. 'You'll kill us if you move.'\r\n\r\nThen he looked over the boat side, and saw that the hard something was\r\nnothing but thousands and thousands of mussels all jammed close\r\ntogether, and through the clear water more and more were coming and\r\npiling themselves together. Almost at once his boat was slowly\r\nlifted--the top of the mussel heap showed through the water, and there\r\nhe was, high and dry on a mussel reef.\r\n\r\nAnd in all that part of the sea the water was disappearing, and as far\r\nas the eye could reach stretched a great plain of purple and gray--the\r\nshells of countless mussels.\r\n\r\nOnly at one spot there was still a splashing.\r\n\r\nThen a mussel opened its shell and spoke.\r\n\r\n'We've got him,' it said. 'We've piled our selves up till we've filled\r\nthis part of the sea. The wind warned all the good fishes--and we've got\r\nthe old traitor in a little pool over there. Get out and walk over our\r\nbacks--we'll all lie sideways so as not to hurt you. You must catch the\r\nfish--but whatever you do don't kill it till we give the word.'\r\n\r\nSep promised, and he got out and walked over the mussels to the pool,\r\nand when he saw the wicked soul of the Magician looking out through the\r\nround eyes of a big finny fish he remembered all that his Princess had\r\nsuffered, and he longed to draw his sword and kill the wicked thing then\r\nand there.\r\n\r\nBut he remembered his promise. He threw a net about it, and dragged it\r\nback to the boat.\r\n\r\nThe mussels dispersed and let the boat down again into the water--and he\r\nrowed home, towing the evil fish in the net by a line.\r\n\r\nHe beached the boat, and looked along the shore. The shore looked a very\r\nodd colour. And well it might, for every bit of the sand was covered\r\nwith purple-gray mussels. They had all come up out of the sea--leaving\r\njust one little bit of real yellow sand for him to beach the boat on.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said millions of sharp thin little voices, 'Kill him, kill him!'\r\n\r\nSep drew his sword and waded into the shallow surf and killed the evil\r\nfish with one strong stroke.\r\n\r\nThen such a shout went up all along the shore as that shore had never\r\nheard; and all along the shore where the mussels had been, stood men in\r\narmour and men in smock-frocks and men in leather aprons and huntsmen's\r\ncoats and women and children--a whole nation of people. Close by the\r\nboat stood a King and Queen with crowns upon their heads.\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Sep,' said the King, 'you've saved us all. I am the King\r\nMussel, doomed to be a mussel so long as that wretch lived. You have set\r\nus all free. And look!'\r\n\r\nDown the path from the shore came running his own Princess, who hung\r\nround his neck crying his name and looking at him with the most\r\nbeautiful eyes in the world.\r\n\r\n'Come,' said the Mussel King, 'we have no son. You shall be our son and\r\nreign after us.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said Sep, 'but _this_ is my father,' and he presented the\r\nold fisherman to His Majesty.\r\n\r\n'Then let him come with us,' said the King royally, 'he can help me\r\nreign, or fish in the palace lake, whichever he prefers.'\r\n\r\n'Thankee,' said Sep's father, 'I'll come and fish.'\r\n\r\n'Your mother too,' said the Mussel Queen, kissing Sep's mother.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said Sep's mother, 'you're a lady, every inch. I'll go to the\r\nworld's end with you.'\r\n\r\nSo they all went back by way of the foreign country where Sep had found\r\nhis Princess, and they called on the old lord. He had lost his hump, and\r\nthey easily persuaded him to come with them.\r\n\r\n'You can help me reign if you like, or we have a nice book or two in the\r\npalace library,' said the Mussel King.\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' said the old lord, 'I'll come and be your librarian if I\r\nmay. Reigning isn't at all in my line.'\r\n\r\nThen they went on to Sep's father-in-law, and when he saw how happy they\r\nall were together he said:\r\n\r\n'Bless my beard but I've half a mind to come with you.'\r\n\r\n'Come along,' said the Mussel King, 'you shall help me reign if you\r\nlike ... or....'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you,' said the other King very quickly, 'I've had enough of\r\nreigning. My kingdom can buy a President and be a republic if it likes.\r\nI'm going to catch butterflies.'\r\n\r\nAnd so he does, most happily, up to this very minute.\r\n\r\nAnd Sep and his dear Princess are as happy as they deserve to be. Some\r\npeople say we are all as happy as we deserve to be--but I am not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE CAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Cat lived at the back of a shelf at the darkest end of the\r\ninside attic which was nearly dark all over. It had lived there for\r\nyears, because one of its white china ears was chipped, so that it was\r\nno longer a possible ornament for the spare bedroom.\r\n\r\nTavy found it at the climax of a wicked and glorious afternoon. He had\r\nbeen left alone. The servants were the only other people in the house.\r\nHe had promised to be good. He had meant to be good. And he had not\r\nbeen. He had done everything you can think of. He had walked into the\r\nduck pond, and not a stitch of his clothes but had had to be changed.\r\nHe had climbed on a hay rick and fallen off it, and had not broken his\r\nneck, which, as cook told him, he richly deserved to do. He had found a\r\nmouse in the trap and put it in the kitchen tea-pot, so that when cook\r\nwent to make tea it jumped out at her, and affected her to screams\r\nfollowed by tears. Tavy was sorry for this, of course, and said so like\r\na man. He had only, he explained, meant to give her a little start. In\r\nthe confusion that followed the mouse, he had eaten all the\r\nblack-currant jam that was put out for kitchen tea, and for this too, he\r\napologised handsomely as soon as it was pointed out to him. He had\r\nbroken a pane of the greenhouse with a stone and.... But why pursue the\r\npainful theme? The last thing he had done was to explore the attic,\r\nwhere he was never allowed to go, and to knock down the White Cat from\r\nits shelf.\r\n\r\nThe sound of its fall brought the servants. The cat was not broken--only\r\nits other ear was chipped. Tavy was put to bed. But he got out as soon\r\nas the servants had gone downstairs, crept up to the attic, secured the\r\nCat, and washed it in the bath. So that when mother came back from\r\nLondon, Tavy, dancing impatiently at the head of the stairs, in a very\r\nwet night-gown, flung himself upon her and cried, 'I've been awfully\r\nnaughty, and I'm frightfully sorry, and please may I have the White Cat\r\nfor my very own?'\r\n\r\nHe was much sorrier than he had expected to be when he saw that mother\r\nwas too tired even to want to know, as she generally did, exactly how\r\nnaughty he had been. She only kissed him, and said:\r\n\r\n'I am sorry you've been naughty, my darling. Go back to bed now.\r\nGood-night.'\r\n\r\nTavy was ashamed to say anything more about the China Cat, so he went\r\nback to bed. But he took the Cat with him, and talked to it and kissed\r\nit, and went to sleep with its smooth shiny shoulder against his cheek.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed, he was extravagantly good. Being good seemed\r\nas easy as being bad usually was. This may have been because mother\r\nseemed so tired and ill; and gentlemen in black coats and high hats came\r\nto see mother, and after they had gone she used to cry. (These things\r\ngoing on in a house sometimes make people good; sometimes they act just\r\nthe other way.) Or it may have been because he had the China Cat to talk\r\nto. Anyhow, whichever way it was, at the end of the week mother said:\r\n\r\n'Tavy, you've been a dear good boy, and a great comfort to me. You must\r\nhave tried very hard to be good.'\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to say, 'No, I haven't, at least not since the first\r\nday,' but Tavy got it said, and was hugged for his pains.\r\n\r\n'You wanted,' said mother, 'the China Cat. Well, you may have it.'\r\n\r\n'For my very own?'\r\n\r\n'For your very own. But you must be very careful not to break it. And\r\nyou mustn't give it away. It goes with the house. Your Aunt Jane made me\r\npromise to keep it in the family. It's very, very old. Don't take it out\r\nof doors for fear of accidents.'\r\n\r\n'I love the White Cat, mother,' said Tavy. 'I love it better'n all my\r\ntoys.'\r\n\r\nThen mother told Tavy several things, and that night when he went to bed\r\nTavy repeated them all faithfully to the China Cat, who was about six\r\ninches high and looked very intelligent.\r\n\r\n'So you see,' he ended, 'the wicked lawyer's taken nearly all mother's\r\nmoney, and we've got to leave our own lovely big White House, and go and\r\nlive in a horrid little house with another house glued on to its side.\r\nAnd mother does hate it so.'\r\n\r\n'I don't wonder,' said the China Cat very distinctly.\r\n\r\n'_What!_' said Tavy, half-way into his night-shirt.\r\n\r\n'I said, I don't wonder, Octavius,' said the China Cat, and rose from\r\nher sitting position, stretched her china legs and waved her white china\r\ntail.\r\n\r\n'You can speak?' said Tavy.\r\n\r\n'Can't you see I can?--hear I mean?' said the Cat. 'I belong to you now,\r\nso I can speak to you. I couldn't before. It wouldn't have been\r\nmanners.'\r\n\r\nTavy, his night-shirt round his neck, sat down on the edge of the bed\r\nwith his mouth open.\r\n\r\n'Come, don't look so silly,' said the Cat, taking a walk along the high\r\nwooden mantelpiece, 'any one would think you didn't _like_ me to talk to\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'I _love_ you to,' said Tavy recovering himself a little.\r\n\r\n'Well then,' said the Cat.\r\n\r\n'May I touch you?' Tavy asked timidly.\r\n\r\n'Of course! I belong to you. Look out!' The China Cat gathered herself\r\ntogether and jumped. Tavy caught her.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a shock to find when one stroked her that the China Cat,\r\nthough alive, was still china, hard, cold, and smooth to the touch, and\r\nyet perfectly brisk and absolutely bendable as any flesh and blood cat.\r\n\r\n'Dear, dear white pussy,' said Tavy, 'I do love you.'\r\n\r\n'And I love you,' purred the Cat, 'otherwise I should never have lowered\r\nmyself to begin a conversation.'\r\n\r\n'I wish you were a real cat,' said Tavy.\r\n\r\n'I am,' said the Cat. 'Now how shall we amuse ourselves? I suppose you\r\ndon't care for sport--mousing, I mean?'\r\n\r\n'I never tried,' said Tavy, 'and I think I rather wouldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Very well then, Octavius,' said the Cat. 'I'll take you to the White\r\nCat's Castle. Get into bed. Bed makes a good travelling carriage,\r\nespecially when you haven't any other. Shut your eyes.'\r\n\r\nTavy did as he was told. Shut his eyes, but could not keep them shut. He\r\nopened them a tiny, tiny chink, and sprang up. He was not in bed. He was\r\non a couch of soft beast-skin, and the couch stood in a splendid hall,\r\nwhose walls were of gold and ivory. By him stood the White Cat, no\r\nlonger china, but real live cat--and fur--as cats should be.\r\n\r\n'Here we are,' she said. 'The journey didn't take long, did it? Now\r\nwe'll have that splendid supper, out of the fairy tale, with the\r\ninvisible hands waiting on us.'\r\n\r\nShe clapped her paws--paws now as soft as white velvet--and a\r\ntable-cloth floated into the room; then knives and forks and spoons and\r\nglasses, the table was laid, the dishes drifted in, and they began to\r\neat. There happened to be every single thing Tavy liked best to eat.\r\nAfter supper there was music and singing, and Tavy, having kissed a\r\nwhite, soft, furry forehead, went to bed in a gold four-poster with a\r\ncounterpane of butterflies' wings. He awoke at home. On the mantelpiece\r\nsat the White Cat, looking as though butter would not melt in her mouth.\r\nAnd all her furriness had gone with her voice. She was silent--and\r\nchina.\r\n\r\nTavy spoke to her. But she would not answer. Nor did she speak all day.\r\nOnly at night when he was getting into bed she suddenly mewed,\r\nstretched, and said:\r\n\r\n'Make haste, there's a play acted to-night at my castle.'\r\n\r\nTavy made haste, and was rewarded by another glorious evening in the\r\ncastle of the White Cat.\r\n\r\nAnd so the weeks went on. Days full of an ordinary little boy's joys and\r\nsorrows, goodnesses and badnesses. Nights spent by a little Prince in\r\nthe Magic Castle of the White Cat.\r\n\r\nThen came the day when Tavy's mother spoke to him, and he, very scared\r\nand serious, told the China Cat what she had said.\r\n\r\n'I knew this would happen,' said the Cat. 'It always does. So you're to\r\nleave your house next week. Well, there's only one way out of the\r\ndifficulty. Draw your sword, Tavy, and cut off my head and tail.'\r\n\r\n'And then will you turn into a Princess, and shall I have to marry you?'\r\nTavy asked with horror.\r\n\r\n'No, dear--no,' said the Cat reassuringly. 'I sha'n't turn into\r\nanything. But you and mother will turn into happy people. I shall just\r\nnot _be_ any more--for you.'\r\n\r\n'Then I won't do it,' said Tavy.\r\n\r\n'But you must. Come, draw your sword, like a brave fairy Prince, and cut\r\noff my head.'\r\n\r\nThe sword hung above his bed, with the helmet and breast-plate Uncle\r\nJames had given him last Christmas.\r\n\r\n'I'm not a fairy Prince,' said the child. 'I'm Tavy--and I love you.'\r\n\r\n'You love your mother better,' said the Cat. 'Come cut my head off. The\r\nstory always ends like that. You love mother best. It's for her sake.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.' Tavy was trying to think it out. 'Yes, I love mother best. But I\r\nlove _you_. And I won't cut off your head,--no, not even for mother.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' said the Cat, 'I must do what I can!'\r\n\r\nShe stood up, waving her white china tail, and before Tavy could stop\r\nher she had leapt, not, as before, into his arms, but on to the wide\r\nhearthstone.\r\n\r\nIt was all over--the China Cat lay broken inside the high brass fender.\r\nThe sound of the smash brought mother running.\r\n\r\n'What is it?' she cried. 'Oh, Tavy--the China Cat!'\r\n\r\n'She would do it,' sobbed Tavy. 'She wanted me to cut off her head'n I\r\nwouldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Don't talk nonsense, dear,' said mother sadly. 'That only makes it\r\nworse. Pick up the pieces.'\r\n\r\n'There's only two pieces,' said Tavy. 'Couldn't you stick her together\r\nagain?'\r\n\r\n'Why,' said mother, holding the pieces close to the candle. 'She's been\r\nbroken before. And mended.'\r\n\r\n'I knew that,' said Tavy, still sobbing. 'Oh, my dear White Cat, oh, oh,\r\noh!' The last 'oh' was a howl of anguish.\r\n\r\n'Come, crying won't mend her,' said mother. 'Look, there's another piece\r\nof her, close to the shovel.'\r\n\r\nTavy stooped.\r\n\r\n'That's not a piece of cat,' he said, and picked it up.\r\n\r\nIt was a pale parchment label, tied to a key. Mother held it to the\r\ncandle and read: '_Key of the lock behind the knot in the mantelpiece\r\npanel in the white parlour._'\r\n\r\n'Tavy! I wonder! But ... where did it come from?'\r\n\r\n'Out of my White Cat, I s'pose,' said Tavy, his tears stopping. 'Are you\r\ngoing to see what's in the mantelpiece panel, mother? Are you? Oh, do\r\nlet me come and see too!'\r\n\r\n'You don't deserve,' mother began, and ended,--'Well, put your\r\ndressing-gown on then.'\r\n\r\nThey went down the gallery past the pictures and the stuffed birds and\r\ntables with china on them and downstairs on to the white parlour. But\r\nthey could not see any knot in the mantelpiece panel, because it was all\r\npainted white. But mother's fingers felt softly all over it, and found a\r\nround raised spot. It was a knot, sure enough. Then she scraped round it\r\nwith her scissors, till she loosened the knot, and poked it out with the\r\nscissors point.\r\n\r\n'I don't suppose there's any keyhole there really,' she said. But there\r\nwas. And what is more, the key fitted. The panel swung open, and inside\r\nwas a little cupboard with two shelves. What was on the shelves? There\r\nwere old laces and old embroideries, old jewelry and old silver; there\r\nwas money, and there were dusty old papers that Tavy thought most\r\nuninteresting. But mother did not think them uninteresting. She laughed,\r\nand cried, or nearly cried, and said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Tavy, this was why the China Cat was to be taken such care of!'\r\nThen she told him how, a hundred and fifty years before, the Head of the\r\nHouse had gone out to fight for the Pretender, and had told his daughter\r\nto take the greatest care of the China Cat. 'I will send you word of the\r\nreason by a sure hand,' he said, for they parted on the open square,\r\nwhere any spy might have overheard anything. And he had been killed by\r\nan ambush not ten miles from home,--and his daughter had never known.\r\nBut she had kept the Cat.\r\n\r\n'And now it has saved us,' said mother. 'We can stay in the dear old\r\nhouse, and there are two other houses that will belong to us too, I\r\nthink. And, oh, Tavy, would you like some pound-cake and ginger-wine,\r\ndear?'\r\n\r\nTavy did like. And had it.\r\n\r\nThe China Cat was mended, but it was put in the glass-fronted corner\r\ncupboard in the drawing-room, because it had saved the House.\r\n\r\nNow I dare say you'll think this is all nonsense, and a made-up story.\r\nNot at all. If it were, how would you account for Tavy's finding, the\r\nvery next night, fast asleep on his pillow, his own white Cat--the furry\r\nfriend that the China Cat used to turn into every evening--the dear\r\nhostess who had amused him so well in the White Cat's fairy Palace?\r\n\r\nIt was she, beyond a doubt, and that was why Tavy didn't mind a bit\r\nabout the China Cat being taken from him and kept under glass. You may\r\nthink that it was just any old stray white cat that had come in by\r\naccident. Tavy knows better. It has the very same tender tone in its\r\npurr that the magic White Cat had. It will not talk to Tavy, it is true;\r\nbut Tavy can and does talk to it. But the thing that makes it perfectly\r\ncertain that it is the White Cat is that the tips of its two ears are\r\nmissing--just as the China Cat's ears were. If you say that it might\r\nhave lost its ear-tips in battle you are the kind of person who always\r\n_makes_ difficulties, and you may be quite sure that the kind of\r\nsplendid magics that happened to Tavy will never happen to _you_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBELINDA AND BELLAMANT; OR THE BELLS OF CARRILLON-LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a certain country where a king is never allowed to reign while\r\na queen can be found. They like queens much better than kings in that\r\ncountry. I can't think why. If some one has tried to teach you a little\r\nhistory, you will perhaps think that this is the Salic law. But it\r\nisn't. In the biggest city of that odd country there is a great\r\nbell-tower (higher than the clock-tower of the Houses of Parliament,\r\nwhere they put M.P.'s who forget their manners). This bell-tower had\r\nseven bells in it, very sweet-toned splendid bells, made expressly to\r\nring on the joyful occasions when a princess was born who would be queen\r\nsome day. And the great tower was built expressly for the bells to ring\r\nin. So you see what a lot they thought of queens in that country. Now in\r\nall the bells there are bell-people--it is their voices that you hear\r\nwhen the bells ring. All that about its being the clapper of the bell is\r\nmere nonsense, and would hardly deceive a child. I don't know why people\r\nsay such things. Most Bell-people are very energetic busy folk, who love\r\nthe sound of their own voices, and hate being idle, and when nearly two\r\nhundred years had gone by, and no princesses had been born, they got\r\ntired of living in bells that were never rung. So they slipped out of\r\nthe belfry one fine frosty night, and left the big beautiful bells\r\nempty, and went off to find other homes. One of them went to live in a\r\ndinner-bell, and one in a school-bell, and the rest all found\r\nhomes--they did not mind where--just anywhere, in fact, where they could\r\nfind any Bell-person kind enough to give them board and lodging. And\r\nevery one was surprised at the increased loudness in the voices of these\r\nhospitable bells. For, of course, the Bell-people from the belfry did\r\ntheir best to help in the housework as polite guests should, and always\r\nadded their voices to those of their hosts on all occasions when\r\nbell-talk was called for. And the seven big beautiful bells in the\r\nbelfry were left hollow and dark and quite empty, except for the\r\nclappers who did not care about the comforts of a home.\r\n\r\nNow of course a good house does not remain empty long, especially when\r\nthere is no rent to pay, and in a very short time the seven bells all\r\nhad tenants, and they were all the kind of folk that no respectable\r\nBell-people would care to be acquainted with.\r\n\r\nThey had been turned out of other bells--cracked bells and broken bells,\r\nthe bells of horses that had been lost in snowstorms or of ships that\r\nhad gone down at sea. They hated work, and they were a glum, silent,\r\ndisagreeable people, but as far as they could be pleased about anything\r\nthey were pleased to live in bells that were never rung, in houses where\r\nthere was nothing to do. They sat hunched up under the black domes of\r\ntheir houses, dressed in darkness and cobwebs, and their only pleasure\r\nwas idleness, their only feasts the thick dusty silence that lies heavy\r\nin all belfries where the bells never ring. They hardly ever spoke even\r\nto each other, and in the whispers that good Bell-people talk in among\r\nthemselves, and that no one can hear but the bat whose ear for music is\r\nvery fine and who has himself a particularly high voice, and when they\r\ndid speak they quarrelled.\r\n\r\nAnd when at last the bells _were_ rung for the birth of a Princess the\r\nwicked Bell-people were furious. Of course they had to _ring_--a bell\r\ncan't help that when the rope is pulled--but their voices were so ugly\r\nthat people were quite shocked.\r\n\r\n'What poor taste our ancestors must have had,' they said, 'to think\r\nthese were good bells!'\r\n\r\n(You remember the bells had not rung for nearly two hundred years.)\r\n\r\n'Dear me,' said the King to the Queen, 'what odd ideas people had in the\r\nold days. I always understood that these bells had beautiful voices.'\r\n\r\n'They're quite hideous,' said the Queen. And so they were. Now that\r\nnight the lazy Bell-folk came down out of the belfry full of anger\r\nagainst the Princess whose birth had disturbed their idleness. There is\r\nno anger like that of a lazy person who is made to work against his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAnd they crept out of the dark domes of their houses and came down in\r\ntheir dust dresses and cobweb cloaks, and crept up to the palace where\r\nevery one had gone to bed long before, and stood round the\r\nmother-of-pearl cradle where the baby princess lay asleep. And they\r\nreached their seven dark right hands out across the white satin\r\ncoverlet, and the oldest and hoarsest and laziest said:\r\n\r\n'She shall grow uglier every day, except Sundays, and every Sunday she\r\nshall be seven times prettier than the Sunday before.'\r\n\r\n'Why not uglier every day, and a double dose on Sunday?' asked the\r\nyoungest and spitefullest of the wicked Bell-people.\r\n\r\n'Because there's no rule without an exception,' said the eldest and\r\nhoarsest and laziest, 'and she'll feel it all the more if she's pretty\r\nonce a week. And,' he added, 'this shall go on till she finds a bell\r\nthat doesn't ring, and can't ring, and never will ring, and wasn't made\r\nto ring.'\r\n\r\n'Why not for ever?' asked the young and spiteful.\r\n\r\n'Nothing goes on for ever,' said the eldest Bell-person, 'not even\r\nill-luck. And we have to leave her a way out. It doesn't matter. She'll\r\nnever know what it is. Let alone finding it.'\r\n\r\nThen they went back to the belfry and rearranged as well as they could\r\nthe comfortable web-and-owls' nest furniture of their houses which had\r\nall been shaken up and disarranged by that absurd ringing of bells at\r\nthe birth of a Princess that nobody could really be pleased about.\r\n\r\nWhen the Princess was two weeks old the King said to the Queen:\r\n\r\n'My love--the Princess is not so handsome as I thought she was.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, Henry,' said the Queen, 'the light's not good, that's all.'\r\n\r\nNext day--it was Sunday--the King pulled back the lace curtains of the\r\ncradle and said:\r\n\r\n'The light's good enough now--and you see she's----'\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n'It _must_ have been the light,' he said, 'she looks all right to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Of course she does, a precious,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\nBut on Monday morning His Majesty was quite sure really that the\r\nPrincess was rather plain, for a Princess. And when Sunday came, and the\r\nPrincess had on her best robe and the cap with the little white ribbons\r\nin the frill, he rubbed his nose and said there was no doubt dress did\r\nmake a great deal of difference. For the Princess was now as pretty as a\r\nnew daisy.\r\n\r\nThe Princess was several years old before her mother could be got to see\r\nthat it really was better for the child to wear plain clothes and a veil\r\non week days. On Sundays, of course she could wear her best frock and a\r\nclean crown just like anybody else.\r\n\r\nOf course nobody ever told the Princess how ugly she was. She wore a\r\nveil on week-days, and so did every one else in the palace, and she was\r\nnever allowed to look in the glass except on Sundays, so that she had no\r\nidea that she was not as pretty all the week as she was on the first day\r\nof it. She grew up therefore quite contented. But the parents were in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n'Because,' said King Henry, 'it's high time she was married. We ought to\r\nchoose a king to rule the realm--I have always looked forward to her\r\nmarrying at twenty-one--and to our retiring on a modest competence to\r\nsome nice little place in the country where we could have a few pigs.'\r\n\r\n'And a cow,' said the Queen, wiping her eyes.\r\n\r\n'And a pony and trap,' said the King.\r\n\r\n'And hens,' said the Queen, 'yes. And now it can never, never be. Look\r\nat the child! I just ask you! Look at her!'\r\n\r\n'_No_,' said the King firmly, 'I haven't done that since she was ten,\r\nexcept on Sundays.'\r\n\r\n'Couldn't we get a prince to agree to a \"Sundays only\" marriage--not let\r\nhim see her during the week?'\r\n\r\n'Such an unusual arrangement,' said the King, 'would involve very\r\nawkward explanations, and I can't think of any except the true ones,\r\nwhich would be quite impossible to give. You see, we should want a\r\nfirst-class prince, and no really high-toned Highness would take a wife\r\non those terms.'\r\n\r\n'It's a thoroughly comfortable kingdom,' said the Queen doubtfully. 'The\r\nyoung man would be handsomely provided for for life.'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't marry Belinda to a time-server or a place-worshipper,' said\r\nthe King decidedly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Princess had taken the matter into her own hands. She had\r\nfallen in love.\r\n\r\nYou know, of course, that a handsome book is sent out every year to all\r\nthe kings who have daughters to marry. It is rather like the illustrated\r\ncatalogues of Liberty's or Peter Robinson's, only instead of\r\nillustrations showing furniture or ladies' cloaks and dresses, the\r\npictures are all of princes who are of an age to be married, and are\r\nlooking out for suitable wives. The book is called the 'Royal Match\r\nCatalogue Illustrated,'--and besides the pictures of the princes it has\r\nlittle printed bits about their incomes, accomplishments, prospects, and\r\ntempers, and relations.\r\n\r\nNow the Princess saw this book--which is never shown to princesses, but\r\nonly to their parents--it was carelessly left lying on the round table\r\nin the parlour. She looked all through it, and she hated each prince\r\nmore than the one before till she came to the very end, and on the last\r\npage of all, screwed away in a corner, was the picture of a prince who\r\nwas quite as good-looking as a prince has any call to be.\r\n\r\n'I like _you_,' said Belinda softly. Then she read the little bit of\r\nprint underneath.\r\n\r\n_Prince Bellamant, aged twenty-four. Wants Princess who doesn't object\r\nto a christening curse. Nature of curse only revealed in the strictest\r\nconfidence. Good tempered. Comfortably off. Quiet habits. No relations._\r\n\r\n'Poor dear,' said the Princess. 'I wonder what the curse is! I'm sure\r\n_I_ shouldn't mind!'\r\n\r\nThe blue dusk of evening was deepening in the garden outside. The\r\nPrincess rang for the lamp and went to draw the curtain. There was a\r\nrustle and a faint high squeak--and something black flopped on to the\r\nfloor and fluttered there.\r\n\r\n'Oh--it's a bat,' cried the Princess, as the lamp came in. 'I don't like\r\nbats.'\r\n\r\n'Let me fetch a dust-pan and brush and sweep the nasty thing away,' said\r\nthe parlourmaid.\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said Belinda, 'it's hurt, poor dear,' and though she hated\r\nbats she picked it up. It was horribly cold to touch, one wing dragged\r\nloosely. 'You can go, Jane,' said the Princess to the parlourmaid.\r\n\r\nThen she got a big velvet-covered box that had had chocolate in it, and\r\nput some cotton wool in it and said to the Bat--\r\n\r\n'You poor dear, is that comfortable?' and the Bat said:\r\n\r\n'Quite, thanks.'\r\n\r\n'Good gracious,' said the Princess jumping. 'I didn't know bats could\r\ntalk.'\r\n\r\n'Every one can talk,' said the Bat, 'but not every one can hear other\r\npeople talking. You have a fine ear as well as a fine heart.'\r\n\r\n'Will your wing ever get well?' asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n'I hope so,' said the Bat. 'But let's talk about you. Do you know why you\r\nwear a veil every day except Sundays?'\r\n\r\n'Doesn't everybody?' asked Belinda.\r\n\r\n'Only here in the palace,' said the Bat, 'that's on your account.'\r\n\r\n'But why?' asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Look in the glass and you'll know.'\r\n\r\n'But it's wicked to look in the glass except on Sundays--and besides\r\nthey're all put away,' said the Princess.\r\n\r\n'If I were you,' said the Bat, 'I should go up into the attic where the\r\nyoungest kitchenmaid sleeps. Feel between the thatch and the wall just\r\nabove her pillow, and you'll find a little round looking-glass. But come\r\nback here before you look at it.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess did exactly what the Bat told her to do, and when she had\r\ncome back into the parlour and shut the door she looked in the little\r\nround glass that the youngest kitchen-maid's sweetheart had given her.\r\nAnd when she saw her ugly, ugly, ugly face--for you must remember she\r\nhad been growing uglier every day since she was born--she screamed and\r\nthen she said:\r\n\r\n'That's not me, it's a horrid picture.'\r\n\r\n'It _is_ you, though,' said the Bat firmly but kindly; 'and now you see\r\nwhy you wear a veil all the week--and only look in the glass on Sunday.'\r\n\r\n'But why,' asked the Princess in tears, 'why don't I look like that in\r\nthe Sunday looking-glasses?'\r\n\r\n'Because you aren't like that on Sundays,' the Bat replied. 'Come,' it\r\nwent on, 'stop crying. I didn't tell you the dread secret of your\r\nugliness just to make you cry--but because I know the way for you to be\r\nas pretty all the week as you are on Sundays, and since you've been so\r\nkind to me I'll tell you. Sit down close beside me, it fatigues me to\r\nspeak loud.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess did, and listened through her veil and her tears, while the\r\nBat told her all that I began this story by telling you.\r\n\r\n'My great-great-great-great-grandfather heard the tale years ago,' he\r\nsaid, 'up in the dark, dusty, beautiful, comfortable, cobwebby belfry,\r\nand I have heard scraps of it myself when the evil Bell-people were\r\nquarrelling, or talking in their sleep, lazy things!'\r\n\r\n'It's very good of you to tell me all this,' said Belinda, 'but what am\r\nI to do?'\r\n\r\n'You must find the bell that doesn't ring, and can't ring, and never\r\nwill ring, and wasn't made to ring.'\r\n\r\n'If I were a prince,' said the Princess, 'I could go out and seek my\r\nfortune.'\r\n\r\n'Princesses have fortunes as well as princes,' said the Bat.\r\n\r\n'But father and mother would never let me go and look for mine.'\r\n\r\n'Think!' said the Bat, 'perhaps you'll find a way.'\r\n\r\nSo Belinda thought and thought. And at last she got the book that had\r\nthe portraits of eligible princes in it, and she wrote to the prince who\r\nhad the christening curse--and this is what she said:\r\n\r\n    'Princess Belinda of Carrillon-land is not afraid of christening\r\n    curses. If Prince Bellamant would like to marry her he had better\r\n    apply to her Royal Father in the usual way.\r\n\r\n    '_P.S._--I have seen your portrait.'\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince got this letter he was very pleased, and wrote at once\r\nfor Princess Belinda's likeness. Of course they sent him a picture of\r\nher Sunday face, which was the most beautiful face in the world. As soon\r\nas he saw it he knew that this was not only the most beautiful face in\r\nthe world, but the dearest, so he wrote to her father by the next\r\npost--applying for her hand in the usual way and enclosing the most\r\nrespectable references. The King told the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Come,' said he, 'what do you say to this young man?'\r\n\r\nAnd the Princess, of course, said, 'Yes, please.'\r\n\r\nSo the wedding-day was fixed for the first Sunday in June.\r\n\r\nBut when the Prince arrived with all his glorious following of courtiers\r\nand men-at-arms, with two pink peacocks and a crown-case full of\r\ndiamonds for his bride, he absolutely refused to be married on a Sunday.\r\nNor would he give any reason for his refusal. And then the King lost his\r\ntemper and broke off the match, and the Prince went away.\r\n\r\nBut he did not go very far. That night he bribed a page-boy to show him\r\nwhich was the Princess's room, and he climbed up by the jasmine through\r\nthe dark rose-scented night, and tapped at the window.\r\n\r\n'Who's dhere?' said the Princess inside in the dark.\r\n\r\n'Me,' said the Prince in the dark outside.\r\n\r\n'Thed id wasnd't true?' said the Princess. 'They toad be you'd ridded\r\naway.'\r\n\r\n'What a cold you've got, my Princess,' said the Prince hanging on by the\r\njasmine boughs.\r\n\r\n'It's not a cold,' sniffed the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Then ... oh you dear ... were you crying because you thought I'd gone?'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' said she.\r\n\r\nHe said, 'You dear!' again, and kissed her hands.\r\n\r\n'_Why_ wouldn't you be married on a Sunday?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'It's the curse, dearest,' he explained, 'I couldn't tell any one but\r\nyou. The fact is Malevola wasn't asked to my christening so she doomed\r\nme to be ... well, she said \"moderately good-looking all the week, and\r\ntoo ugly for words on Sundays.\" So you see! You _will_ be married on a\r\nweek-day, won't you?'\r\n\r\n'But I can't,' said the Princess, 'because I've got a curse too--only\r\nI'm ugly all the week and pretty on Sundays.'\r\n\r\n'How extremely tiresome,' said the Prince, 'but can't you be cured?'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' said the Princess, and told him how. 'And you,' she asked, 'is\r\nyours quite incurable?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' he answered, 'I've only got to stay under water for five\r\nminutes and the spell will be broken. But you see, beloved, the\r\ndifficulty is that I can't do it. I've practised regularly, from a boy,\r\nin the sea, and in the swimming bath, and even in my wash-hand\r\nbasin--hours at a time I've practised--but I never can keep under more\r\nthan two minutes.'\r\n\r\n'Oh dear,' said the Princess, 'this is dreadful.'\r\n\r\n'It is rather trying,' the Prince answered.\r\n\r\n'You're sure you like me,' she asked suddenly, 'now you know that I'm\r\nonly pretty once a week?'\r\n\r\n'I'd die for you,' said he.\r\n\r\n'Then I'll tell you what. Send all your courtiers away, and take a\r\nsituation as under-gardener here--I know we want one. And then every\r\nnight I'll climb down the jasmine and we'll go out together and seek our\r\nfortune. I'm sure we shall find it.'\r\n\r\nAnd they did go out. The very next night, and the next, and the next,\r\nand the next, and the next, and the next. And they did not find their\r\nfortunes, but they got fonder and fonder of each other. They could not\r\nsee each other's faces, but they held hands as they went along through\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nAnd on the seventh night, as they passed by a house that showed chinks\r\nof light through its shutters, they heard a bell being rung outside for\r\nsupper, a bell with a very loud and beautiful voice. But instead of\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n'Supper's ready,' as any one would have expected, the bell was saying--\r\n\r\n    Ding dong dell!\r\n    _I_ could tell\r\n    Where you ought to go\r\n    To break the spell.\r\n\r\nThen some one left off ringing the bell, so of course it couldn't say\r\nany more. So the two went on. A little way down the road a cow-bell\r\ntinkled behind the wet hedge of the lane. And it said--not, 'Here I am,\r\nquite safe,' as a cow-bell should, but--\r\n\r\n    Ding dong dell\r\n    All will be well\r\n    If you...\r\n\r\nThen the cow stopped walking and began to eat, so the bell couldn't say\r\nany more. The Prince and Princess went on, and you will not be surprised\r\nto hear that they heard the voices of five more bells that night. The\r\nnext was a school-bell. The schoolmaster's little boy thought it would\r\nbe fun to ring it very late at night--but his father came and caught him\r\nbefore the bell could say any more than--\r\n\r\n    Ding a dong dell\r\n    You can break up the spell\r\n    By taking...\r\n\r\nSo that was no good.\r\n\r\nThen there were the three bells that were the sign over the door of an\r\ninn where people were happily dancing to a fiddle, because there was a\r\nwedding. These bells said:\r\n\r\n    We are the\r\n    Merry three\r\n    Bells, bells, bells.\r\n    You are two\r\n    To undo\r\n    Spells, spells, spells...\r\n\r\nThen the wind who was swinging the bells suddenly thought of an\r\nappointment he had made with a pine forest, to get up an entertaining\r\nimitation of sea-waves for the benefit of the forest nymphs who had\r\nnever been to the seaside, and he went off--so, of course, the bells\r\ncouldn't ring any more, and the Prince and Princess went on down the\r\ndark road.\r\n\r\nThere was a cottage and the Princess pulled her veil closely over her\r\nface, for yellow light streamed from its open door--and it was a\r\nWednesday.\r\n\r\nInside a little boy was sitting on the floor--quite a little boy--he\r\nought to have been in bed long before, and I don't know why he wasn't.\r\nAnd he was ringing a little tinkling bell that had dropped off a sleigh.\r\n\r\nAnd this little bell said:\r\n\r\n    Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, I'm a little sleigh-bell,\r\n    But I know what I know, and I'll tell, tell, tell.\r\n    Find the Enchanter of the Ringing Well,\r\n    He will show you how to break the spell, spell, spell.\r\n    Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, I'm a little sleigh-bell,\r\n    But I know what I know....\r\n\r\nAnd so on, over and over, again and again, because the little boy was\r\nquite contented to go on shaking his sleigh-bell for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n'So now we know,' said the Prince, 'isn't that glorious?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, very, but where's the Enchanter of the Ringing Well?' said the\r\nPrincess doubtfully.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I've got _his_ address in my pocket-book,' said the Prince. 'He's\r\nmy god-father. He was one of the references I gave your father.'\r\n\r\nSo the next night the Prince brought a horse to the garden, and he and\r\nthe Princess mounted, and rode, and rode, and rode, and in the grey dawn\r\nthey came to Wonderwood, and in the very middle of that the Magician's\r\nPalace stands.\r\n\r\nThe Princess did not like to call on a perfect stranger so very early in\r\nthe morning, so they decided to wait a little and look about them.\r\n\r\nThe castle was very beautiful, decorated with a conventional design of\r\nbells and bell ropes, carved in white stone.\r\n\r\nLuxuriant plants of American bell-vine covered the drawbridge and\r\nportcullis. On a green lawn in front of the castle was a well, with a\r\ncurious bell-shaped covering suspended over it. The lovers leaned over\r\nthe mossy fern-grown wall of the well, and, looking down, they could see\r\nthat the narrowness of the well only lasted for a few feet, and below\r\nthat it spread into a cavern where water lay in a big pool.\r\n\r\n'What cheer?' said a pleasant voice behind them. It was the Enchanter,\r\nan early riser, like Darwin was, and all other great scientific men.\r\n\r\nThey told him what cheer.\r\n\r\n'But,' Prince Bellamant ended, 'it's really no use. I can't keep under\r\nwater more than two minutes however much I try. And my precious\r\nBelinda's not likely to find any silly old bell that doesn't ring, and\r\ncan't ring, and never will ring, and was never made to ring.'\r\n\r\n'Ho, ho,' laughed the Enchanter with the soft full laughter of old age.\r\n'You've come to the right shop. Who told you?'\r\n\r\n'The bells,' said Belinda.\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes.' The old man frowned kindly upon them. 'You must be very fond\r\nof each other?'\r\n\r\n'We are,' said the two together.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' the Enchanter answered, 'because only true lovers can hear the\r\ntrue speech of the bells, and then only when they're together. Well,\r\nthere's the bell!'\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the covering of the well, went forward, and touched some\r\nlever or spring. The covering swung out from above the well, and hung\r\nover the grass grey with the dew of dawn.\r\n\r\n'_That?_' said Bellamant.\r\n\r\n'That,' said his god-father. 'It doesn't ring, and it can't ring, and it\r\nnever will ring, and it was never made to ring. Get into it.'\r\n\r\n'Eh?' said Bellamant forgetting his manners.\r\n\r\nThe old man took a hand of each and led them under the bell.\r\n\r\nThey looked up. It had windows of thick glass, and high seats about\r\nfour feet from its edge, running all round inside.\r\n\r\n'Take your seats,' said the Enchanter.\r\n\r\nBellamant lifted his Princess to the bench and leaped up beside her.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said the old man, 'sit still, hold each other's hands, and for\r\nyour lives don't move.'\r\n\r\nHe went away, and next moment they felt the bell swing in the air. It\r\nswung round till once more it was over the well, and then it went down,\r\ndown, down.\r\n\r\n'I'm not afraid, with you,' said Belinda, because she was, dreadfully.\r\n\r\nDown went the bell. The glass windows leaped into light, looking through\r\nthem the two could see blurred glories of lamps in the side of the cave,\r\nmagic lamps, or perhaps merely electric, which, curiously enough have\r\nceased to seem magic to us nowadays. Then with a plop the lower edge of\r\nthe bell met the water, the water rose inside it, a little, then not any\r\nmore. And the bell went down, down, and above their heads the green\r\nwater lapped against the windows of the bell.\r\n\r\n'You're under water--if we stay five minutes,' Belinda whispered.\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear,' said Bellamant, and pulled out his ruby-studded\r\nchronometer.\r\n\r\n'It's five minutes for you, but oh!' cried Belinda, 'it's _now_ for me.\r\nFor I've found the bell that doesn't ring, and can't ring, and never\r\nwill ring, and wasn't made to ring. Oh Bellamant dearest, it's Thursday.\r\n_Have_ I got my Sunday face?'\r\n\r\nShe tore away her veil, and his eyes, fixed upon her face, could not\r\nleave it.\r\n\r\n'Oh dream of all the world's delight,' he murmured, 'how beautiful you\r\nare.'\r\n\r\nNeither spoke again till a sudden little shock told them that the bell\r\nwas moving up again.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense,' said Bellamant, 'it's not five minutes.'\r\n\r\nBut when they looked at the ruby-studded chronometer, it was nearly\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. But then, of course, the well was enchanted!\r\n\r\n'Magic? Nonsense,' said the old man when they hung about him with thanks\r\nand pretty words. 'It's only a diving-bell. My own invention.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo they went home and were married, and the Princess did not wear a veil\r\nat the wedding. She said she had had enough veils to last her time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd a year and a day after that a little daughter was born to them.\r\n\r\n'Now sweetheart,' said King Bellamant--he was king now because the old\r\nking and queen had retired from the business, and were keeping pigs and\r\nhens in the country as they had always planned to do--'dear sweetheart\r\nand life's love, I am going to ring the bells with my own hands, to show\r\nhow glad I am for you, and for the child, and for our good life\r\ntogether.'\r\n\r\nSo he went out. It was very dark, because the baby princess had chosen\r\nto be born at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe King went out to the belfry, that stood in the great, bare, quiet,\r\nmoonlit square, and he opened the door. The furry-pussy bell-ropes, like\r\nhuge caterpillars, hung on the first loft. The King began to climb the\r\ncurly-wurly stone stair. And as he went up he heard a noise, the\r\nstrangest noises, stamping and rustling and deep breathings.\r\n\r\nHe stood still in the ringers' loft where the pussy-furry caterpillary\r\nbell-robes hung, and from the belfry above he heard the noise of strong\r\nfighting, and mixed with it the sound of voices angry and desperate, but\r\nwith a noble note that thrilled the soul of the hearer like the sound of\r\nthe trumpet in battle. And the voices cried:\r\n\r\n    Down, down--away, away,\r\n    When good has come ill may not stay,\r\n    Out, out, into the night,\r\n    The belfry bells are ours by right!\r\n\r\nAnd the words broke and joined again, like water when it flows against\r\nthe piers of a bridge. 'Down, down----.' 'Ill may not stay----.' 'Good\r\nhas come----.' 'Away, away----.' And the joining came like the sound of\r\nthe river that flows free again.\r\n\r\n    Out, out, into the night,\r\n    The belfry bells are ours by right!\r\n\r\nAnd then, as King Bellamant stood there, thrilled and yet, as it were,\r\nturned to stone, by the magic of this conflict that raged above him,\r\nthere came a sweeping rush down the belfry ladder. The lantern he\r\ncarried showed him a rout of little, dark, evil people, clothed in dust\r\nand cobwebs, that scurried down the wooden steps gnashing their teeth\r\nand growling in the bitterness of a deserved defeat. They passed and\r\nthere was silence. Then the King flew from rope to rope pulling lustily,\r\nand from above, the bells answered in their own clear beautiful\r\nvoices--because the good Bell-folk had driven out the usurpers and had\r\ncome to their own again.\r\n\r\n    Ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring! Ring, bell!\r\n    A little baby comes on earth to dwell. Ring, bell!\r\n    Sound, bell! Sound! Swell!\r\n    Ring for joy and wish her well!\r\n    May her life tell\r\n    No tale of ill-spell!\r\n    Ring, bell! Joy, bell! Love, bell! Ring!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'But I don't see,' said King Bellamant, when he had told Queen Belinda\r\nall about it, 'how it was that I came to hear them. The Enchanter of the\r\nRinging Well said that only lovers could hear what the bells had to say,\r\nand then only when they were together.'\r\n\r\n'You silly dear boy,' said Queen Belinda, cuddling the baby princess\r\nclose under her chin, 'we _are_ lovers, aren't we? And you don't suppose\r\nI wasn't with you when you went to ring the bells for our baby--my heart\r\nand soul anyway--all of me that matters!'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the King, 'of course you were. That accounts!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nJUSTNOWLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n'Auntie! No, no, no! I will be good. Oh, I will!' The little weak voice\r\ncame from the other side of the locked attic door.\r\n\r\n'You should have thought of that before,' said the strong, sharp voice\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean to be naughty. I didn't, truly.'\r\n\r\n'It's not what you mean, miss, it's what you do. I'll teach you not to\r\nmean, my lady.'\r\n\r\nThe bitter irony of the last words dried the child's tears. 'Very well,\r\nthen,' she screamed, 'I won't be good; I won't try to be good. I thought\r\nyou'd like your nasty old garden weeded. I only did it to please you.\r\nHow was I to know it was turnips? It looked just like weeds.' Then came\r\na pause, then another shriek. 'Oh, Auntie, don't! Oh, let me out--let me\r\nout!'\r\n\r\n'I'll not let you out till I've broken your spirit, my girl; you may\r\nrely on that.'\r\n\r\nThe sharp voice stopped abruptly on a high note; determined feet in\r\nstrong boots sounded on the stairs--fainter, fainter; a door slammed\r\nbelow with a dreadful definiteness, and Elsie was left alone, to wonder\r\nhow soon her spirit would break--for at no less a price, it appeared,\r\ncould freedom be bought.\r\n\r\nThe outlook seemed hopeless. The martyrs and heroines, with whom Elsie\r\nusually identified herself, _their_ spirit had never been broken; not\r\nchains nor the rack nor the fiery stake itself had even weakened them.\r\nImprisonment in an attic would to them have been luxury compared with\r\nthe boiling oil and the smoking faggots and all the intimate cruelties\r\nof mysterious instruments of steel and leather, in cold dungeons, lit\r\nonly by the dull flare of torches and the bright, watchful eyes of\r\ninquisitors.\r\n\r\nA month in the house of 'Auntie' self-styled, and really only an\r\nunrelated Mrs. Staines, paid to take care of the child, had held but one\r\ninterest--Foxe's Book of Martyrs. It was a horrible book--the thick\r\noleographs, their guarding sheets of tissue paper sticking to the prints\r\nlike bandages to a wound.... Elsie knew all about wounds: she had had\r\none herself. Only a scalded hand, it is true, but a wound is a wound,\r\nall the world over. It was a book that made you afraid to go to bed; but\r\nit was a book you could not help reading. And now it seemed as though it\r\nmight at last help, and not merely sicken and terrify. But the help was\r\nfrail, and broke almost instantly on the thought--'_They_ were brave\r\nbecause they were good: how can I be brave when there's nothing to be\r\nbrave about except me not knowing the difference between turnips and\r\nweeds?'\r\n\r\nShe sank down, a huddled black bunch on the bare attic floor, and called\r\nwildly to some one who could not answer her. Her frock was black because\r\nthe one who always used to answer could not answer any more. And her\r\nfather was in India, where you cannot answer, or even hear, your little\r\ngirl, however much she cries in England.\r\n\r\n'I won't cry,' said Elsie, sobbing as violently as ever. 'I can be\r\nbrave, even if I'm not a saint but only a turnip-mistaker. I'll be a\r\nBastille prisoner, and tame a mouse!' She dried her eyes, though the\r\nbosom of the black frock still heaved like the sea after a storm, and\r\nlooked about for a mouse to tame. One could not begin too soon. But\r\nunfortunately there seemed to be no mouse at liberty just then. There\r\nwere mouse-holes right enough, all round the wainscot, and in the broad,\r\ntime-worn boards of the old floor. But never a mouse.\r\n\r\n'Mouse, mouse!' Elsie called softly. 'Mousie, mousie, come and be\r\ntamed!'\r\n\r\nNot a mouse replied.\r\n\r\nThe attic was perfectly empty and dreadfully clean. The other attic,\r\nElsie knew, had lots of interesting things in it--old furniture and\r\nsaddles, and sacks of seed potatoes,--but in this attic nothing. Not so\r\nmuch as a bit of string on the floor that one could make knots in, or\r\ntwist round one's finger till it made the red ridges that are so\r\ninteresting to look at afterwards; not even a piece of paper in the\r\ndraughty, cold fireplace that one could make paper boats of, or prick\r\nletters in with a pin or the tag of one's shoe-laces.\r\n\r\nAs she stooped to see whether under the grate some old match-box or bit\r\nof twig might have escaped the broom, she saw suddenly what she had\r\nwanted most--a mouse. It was lying on its side. She put out her hand\r\nvery slowly and gently, and whispered in her softest tones, 'Wake up,\r\nMousie, wake up, and come and be tamed.' But the mouse never moved. And\r\nwhen she took it in her hand it was cold.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' she moaned, 'you're dead, and now I can never tame you'; and she\r\nsat on the cold hearth and cried again, with the dead mouse in her lap.\r\n\r\n'Don't cry,' said somebody. 'I'll find you something to tame--if you\r\nreally want it.'\r\n\r\nElsie started and saw the head of a black bird peering at her through\r\nthe square opening that leads to the chimney. The edges of him looked\r\nragged and rainbow-coloured, but that was because she saw him through\r\ntears. To a tearless eye he was black and very smooth and sleek.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' she said, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' said the bird politely. 'You are surprised to hear me speak,\r\nbut your surprise will be, of course, much less when I tell you that I\r\nam really a Prime Minister condemned by an Enchanter to wear the form of\r\na crow till ... till I can get rid of it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' said Elsie.\r\n\r\n'Yes, indeed,' said the Crow, and suddenly grew smaller till he could\r\ncome comfortably through the square opening. He did this, perched on the\r\ntop bar, and hopped to the floor. And there he got bigger and bigger,\r\nand bigger and bigger and bigger. Elsie had scrambled to her feet, and\r\nthen a black little girl of eight and of the usual size stood face to\r\nface with a crow as big as a man, and no doubt as old. She found words\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't!' she cried. 'Don't get any bigger. I can't bear it.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ can't _do_ it,' said the Crow kindly, 'so that's all right. I\r\nthought you'd better get used to seeing rather large crows before I take\r\nyou to Crownowland. We are all life-size there.'\r\n\r\n'But a crow's life-size isn't a man's life-size,' Elsie managed to say.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, it is--when it's an enchanted Crow,' the bird replied. 'That\r\nmakes all the difference. Now you were saying you wanted to tame\r\nsomething. If you'll come with me to Crownowland I'll show you something\r\nworth taming.'\r\n\r\n'Is Crow-what's-its-name a nice place?' Elsie asked cautiously. She was,\r\nsomehow, not so very frightened now.\r\n\r\n'Very,' said the Crow.\r\n\r\n'Then perhaps I shall like it so much I sha'n't want to be taming\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, you will, when you know how much depends on it.'\r\n\r\n'But I shouldn't like,' said Elsie, 'to go up the chimney. This isn't my\r\nbest frock, of course, but still....'\r\n\r\n'Quite so,' said the Crow. 'I only came that way for fun, and because I\r\ncan fly. You shall go in by the chief gate of the kingdom, like a lady.\r\nDo come.'\r\n\r\nBut Elsie still hesitated. 'What sort of thing is it you want me to\r\ntame?' she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe enormous crow hesitated. 'A--a sort of lizard,' it said at last.\r\n'And if you can only tame it so that it will do what you tell it to,\r\nyou'll save the whole kingdom, and we'll put up a statue to you; but not\r\nin the People's Park, unless they wish it,' the bird added mysteriously.\r\n\r\n'I should like to save a kingdom,' said Elsie, 'and I like lizards. I've\r\nseen lots of them in India.'\r\n\r\n'Then you'll come?' said the Crow.\r\n\r\n'Yes. But how do we go?'\r\n\r\n'There are only two doors out of this world into another,' said the\r\nCrow. 'I'll take you through the nearest. Allow me!' It put its wing\r\nround her so that her face nestled against the black softness of the\r\nunder-wing feathers. It was warm and dark and sleepy there, and very\r\ncomfortable. For a moment she seemed to swim easily in a soft sea of\r\ndreams. Then, with a little shock, she found herself standing on a\r\nmarble terrace, looking out over a city far more beautiful and\r\nwonderful than she had ever seen or imagined. The great man-sized Crow\r\nwas by her side.\r\n\r\n'Now,' it said, pointing with the longest of its long black\r\nwing-feathers, 'you see this beautiful city?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Elsie, 'of course I do.'\r\n\r\n'Well ... I hardly like to tell you the story,' said the Crow, 'but it's\r\na long time ago, and I hope you won't think the worse of us--because\r\nwe're really very sorry.'\r\n\r\n'If you're really sorry,' said Elsie primly, 'of course it's all right.'\r\n\r\n'Unfortunately it isn't,' said the Crow. 'You see the great square down\r\nthere?'\r\n\r\nElsie looked down on a square of green trees, broken a little towards\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\n'Well, that's where the ... where _it_ is--what you've got to tame, you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n'But what did you do that was wrong?'\r\n\r\n'We were unkind,' said the Crow slowly, 'and unjust, and ungenerous. We\r\nhad servants and workpeople doing everything for us; we had nothing to\r\ndo _but_ be kind. And we weren't.'\r\n\r\n'Dear me,' said Elsie feebly.\r\n\r\n'We had several warnings,' said the Crow. 'There was an old parchment,\r\nand it said just how you ought to behave and all that. But we didn't\r\ncare what it said. I was Court Magician as well as Prime Minister, and I\r\nought to have known better, but I didn't. We all wore frock-coats and\r\nhigh hats then,' he added sadly.\r\n\r\n'Go on,' said Elsie, her eyes wandering from one beautiful building to\r\nanother of the many that nestled among the trees of the city.\r\n\r\n'And the old parchment said that if we didn't behave well our bodies\r\nwould grow like our souls. But we didn't think so. And then all in a\r\nminute they _did_--and we were crows, and our bodies were as black as\r\nour souls. Our souls are quite white now,' it added reassuringly.\r\n\r\n'But what was _the_ dreadful thing you'd done?'\r\n\r\n'We'd been unkind to the people who worked for us--not given them enough\r\nfood or clothes or fire, and at last we took away even their play. There\r\nwas a big park that the people played in, and we built a wall round it\r\nand took it for ourselves, and the King was going to set a statue of\r\nhimself up in the middle. And then before we could begin to enjoy it we\r\nwere turned into big black crows; and the working people into big white\r\npigeons--and _they_ can go where they like, but we have to stay here\r\ntill we've tamed the.... We never can go into the park, until we've\r\nsettled the thing that guards it. And that thing's a big big lizard--in\r\nfact ... it's a _dragon_!'\r\n\r\n'_Oh!_' cried Elsie; but she was not as frightened as the Crow seemed to\r\nexpect. Because every now and then she had felt sure that she was really\r\nsafe in her own bed, and that this was a dream. It was not a dream, but\r\nthe belief that it was made her very brave, and she felt quite sure that\r\nshe could settle a dragon, if necessary--a dream dragon, that is. And\r\nthe rest of the time she thought about Foxe's Book of Martyrs and what a\r\nheroine she now had the chance to be.\r\n\r\n'You want me to kill it?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh no! To tame it,' said the Crow.\r\n\r\n'We've tried all sorts of means--long whips, like people tame horses\r\nwith, and red-hot bars, such as lion-tamers use--and it's all been\r\nperfectly useless; and there the dragon lives, and will live till some\r\none can tame him and get him to follow them like a tame fawn, and eat\r\nout of their hand.'\r\n\r\n'What does the dragon _like_ to eat?' Elsie asked.\r\n\r\n'_Crows_,' replied the other in an uncomfortable whisper. 'At least\r\n_I've_ never known it eat anything else!'\r\n\r\n'Am I to try to tame it _now_?' Elsie asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh dear no,' said the Crow. 'We'll have a banquet in your honour, and\r\nyou shall have tea with the Princess.'\r\n\r\n'How do you know who is a princess and who's not, if you're all crows?'\r\nElsie cried.\r\n\r\n'How do you know one human being from another?' the Crow replied.\r\n'Besides ... Come on to the Palace.'\r\n\r\nIt led her along the terrace, and down some marble steps to a small\r\narched door. 'The tradesmen's entrance,' it explained. 'Excuse it--the\r\ncourtiers are crowding in by the front door.' Then through long\r\ncorridors and passages they went, and at last into the throne-room. Many\r\ncrows stood about in respectful attitudes. On the golden throne, leaning\r\na gloomy head upon the first joint of his right wing, the Sovereign of\r\nCrownowland was musing dejectedly. A little girl of about Elsie's age\r\nsat on the steps of the throne nursing a handsome doll.\r\n\r\n'Who is the little girl?' Elsie asked.\r\n\r\n'_Curtsey!_ That's the Princess,' the Prime Minister Crow whispered; and\r\nElsie made the best curtsey she could think of in such a hurry. 'She\r\nwasn't wicked enough to be turned into a crow, or poor enough to be\r\nturned into a pigeon, so she remains a dear little girl, just as she\r\nalways was.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess dropped her doll and ran down the steps of the throne to\r\nmeet Elsie.\r\n\r\n'You dear!' she said. 'You've come to play with me, haven't you? All\r\nthe little girls I used to play with have turned into crows, and their\r\nbeaks are _so_ awkward at doll's tea-parties, and wings are no good to\r\nnurse dollies with. Let's have a doll's tea-party _now_, shall we?'\r\n\r\n'May we?' Elsie looked at the Crow King, who nodded his head hopelessly.\r\nSo, hand in hand, they went.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether you have ever had the run of a perfectly beautiful\r\npalace and a nursery absolutely crammed with all the toys you ever had\r\nor wanted to have: dolls' houses, dolls' china tea-sets, rocking-horses,\r\nbricks, nine-pins, paint-boxes, conjuring tricks, pewter\r\ndinner-services, and any number of dolls--all most agreeable and\r\ndistinguished. If you have, you may perhaps be able faintly to imagine\r\nElsie's happiness. And better than all the toys was the Princess\r\nPerdona--so gentle and kind and jolly, full of ideas for games, and\r\nsurrounded by the means for playing them. Think of it, after that bare\r\nattic, with not even a bit of string to play with, and no company but\r\nthe poor little dead mouse!\r\n\r\nThere is no room in this story to tell you of all the games they had. I\r\ncan only say that the time went by so quickly that they never noticed it\r\ngoing, and were amazed when the Crown nursemaid brought in the royal\r\ntea-tray. Tea was a beautiful meal--with pink iced cake in it.\r\n\r\nNow, all the time that these glorious games had been going on, and this\r\nmagnificent tea, the wisest crows of Crownowland had been holding a\r\ncouncil. They had decided that there was no time like the present, and\r\nthat Elsie had better try to tame the dragon soon as late. 'But,' the\r\nKing said, 'she mustn't run any risks. A guard of fifty stalwart crows\r\nmust go with her, and if the dragon shows the least temper, fifty crows\r\nmust throw themselves between her and danger, even if it cost fifty-one\r\ncrow-lives. For I myself will lead that band. Who will volunteer?'\r\n\r\nVolunteers, to the number of some thousands, instantly stepped forward,\r\nand the Field Marshal selected fifty of the strongest crows.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the pleasant pinkness of the sunset, Elsie was led out on\r\nto the palace steps, where the King made a speech and said what a\r\nheroine she was, and how like Joan of Arc. And the crows who had\r\ngathered from all parts of the town cheered madly. Did you ever hear\r\ncrows cheering? It is a wonderful sound.\r\n\r\nThen Elsie got into a magnificent gilt coach, drawn by eight white\r\nhorses, with a crow at the head of each horse. The Princess sat with her\r\non the blue velvet cushions and held her hand.\r\n\r\n'I _know_ you'll do it,' said she; 'you're so brave and clever, Elsie!'\r\n\r\nAnd Elsie felt braver than before, although now it did not seem so like\r\na dream. But she thought of the martyrs, and held Perdona's hand very\r\ntight.\r\n\r\nAt the gates of the green park the Princess kissed and hugged her new\r\nfriend--her state crown, which she had put on in honour of the occasion,\r\ngot pushed quite on one side in the warmth of her embrace--and Elsie\r\nstepped out of the carriage. There was a great crowd of crows round the\r\npark gates, and every one cheered and shouted 'Speech, speech!'\r\n\r\nElsie got as far as 'Ladies and gentlemen--Crows, I mean,' and then she\r\ncould not think of anything more, so she simply added, 'Please, I'm\r\nready.'\r\n\r\nI wish you could have heard those crows cheer.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie wouldn't have the escort.\r\n\r\n'It's very kind,' she said, 'but the dragon only eats crows, and I'm not\r\na crow, thank goodness--I mean I'm not a crow--and if I've got to be\r\nbrave I'd like to _be_ brave, and none of you to get eaten. If only some\r\none will come with me to show me the way and then run back as hard as he\r\ncan when we get near the dragon. _Please!_'\r\n\r\n'If only one goes _I_ shall be the one,' said the King. And he and Elsie\r\nwent through the great gates side by side. She held the end of his wing,\r\nwhich was the nearest they could get to hand in hand.\r\n\r\nThe crowd outside waited in breathless silence. Elsie and the King went\r\non through the winding paths of the People's Park. And by the winding\r\npaths they came at last to the Dragon. He lay very peacefully on a great\r\nstone slab, his enormous bat-like wings spread out on the grass and his\r\ngoldy-green scales glittering in the pretty pink sunset light.\r\n\r\n'Go back!' said Elsie.\r\n\r\n'No,' said the King.\r\n\r\n'If you don't,' said Elsie, '_I_ won't go _on_. Seeing a crow might\r\nrouse him to fury, or give him an appetite, or something. Do--do go!'\r\n\r\nSo he went, but not far. He hid behind a tree, and from its shelter he\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nElsie drew a long breath. Her heart was thumping under the black frock.\r\n'Suppose,' she thought, 'he takes me for a crow!' But she thought how\r\nyellow her hair was, and decided that the dragon would be certain to\r\nnotice that.\r\n\r\n'Quick march!' she said to herself, 'remember Joan of Arc,' and walked\r\nright up to the dragon. It never moved, but watched her suspiciously out\r\nof its bright green eyes.\r\n\r\n'Dragon dear!' she said in her clear little voice.\r\n\r\n'_Eh?_' said the dragon, in tones of extreme astonishment.\r\n\r\n'Dragon dear,' she repeated, 'do you like sugar?'\r\n\r\n'_Yes_,' said the dragon.\r\n\r\n'Well, I've brought you some. You won't hurt me if I bring it to you?'\r\n\r\nThe dragon violently shook its vast head.\r\n\r\n'It's not much,' said Elsie, 'but I saved it at tea-time. Four lumps.\r\nTwo for each of my mugs of milk.'\r\n\r\nShe laid the sugar on the stone slab by the dragon's paw.\r\n\r\nIt turned its head towards the sugar. The pinky sunset light fell on its\r\nface, and Elsie saw that it was weeping! Great fat tears as big as prize\r\npears were coursing down its wrinkled cheeks.\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't,' said Elsie, '_don't_ cry! Poor dragon, what's the matter?'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' sobbed the dragon, 'I'm only so glad you've come. I--I've been so\r\nlonely. No one to love me. You _do_ love me, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'I--I'm sure I shall when I know you better,' said Elsie kindly.\r\n\r\n'Give me a kiss, dear,' said the dragon, sniffing.\r\n\r\nIt is no joke to kiss a dragon. But Elsie did it--somewhere on the hard\r\ngreen wrinkles of its forehead.\r\n\r\n'Oh, _thank_ you,' said the dragon, brushing away its tears with the tip\r\nof its tail. 'That breaks the charm. I can move now. And I've got back\r\nall my lost wisdom. Come along--I _do_ want my tea!'\r\n\r\nSo, to the waiting crowd at the gate came Elsie and the dragon side by\r\nside. And at sight of the dragon, tamed, a great shout went up from the\r\ncrowd; and at that shout each one in the crowd turned quickly to the\r\nnext one--for it was the shout of men, and not of crows. Because at the\r\nfirst sight of the dragon, tamed, they had left off being crows for ever\r\nand ever, and once again were men.\r\n\r\nThe King came running through the gates, his royal robes held high, so\r\nthat he shouldn't trip over them, and he too was no longer a crow, but a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAnd what did Elsie feel after being so brave? Well, she felt that she\r\nwould like to cry, and also to laugh, and she felt that she loved not\r\nonly the dragon, but every man, woman, and child in the whole\r\nworld--even Mrs. Staines.\r\n\r\nShe rode back to the Palace on the dragon's back.\r\n\r\nAnd as they went the crowd of citizens who had been crows met the crowd\r\nof citizens who had been pigeons, and these were poor men in poor\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nIt would have done you good to see how the ones who had been rich and\r\ncrows ran to meet the ones who had been pigeons and poor.\r\n\r\n'Come and stay at my house, brother,' they cried to those who had no\r\nhomes. 'Brother, I have many coats, come and choose some,' they cried to\r\nthe ragged. 'Come and feast with me!' they cried to all. And the rich\r\nand the poor went off arm in arm to feast and be glad that night, and\r\nthe next day to work side by side. 'For,' said the King, speaking with\r\nhis hand on the neck of the tamed dragon, 'our land has been called\r\nCrownowland. But we are no longer crows. We are men: and we will be Just\r\nmen. And our country shall be called Justnowland for ever and ever. And\r\nfor the future we shall not be rich and poor, but fellow-workers, and\r\neach will do his best for his brothers and his own city. And your King\r\nshall be your servant!'\r\n\r\nI don't know how they managed this, but no one seemed to think that\r\nthere would be any difficulty about it when the King mentioned it; and\r\nwhen people really make up their minds to do anything, difficulties do\r\nmost oddly disappear.\r\n\r\nWonderful rejoicings there were. The city was hung with flags and lamps.\r\nBands played--the performers a little out of practice, because, of\r\ncourse, crows can't play the flute or the violin or the trombone--but\r\nthe effect was very gay indeed. Then came the time--it was quite\r\ndark--when the King rose up on his throne and spoke; and Elsie, among\r\nall her new friends, listened with them to his words.\r\n\r\n'Our deliverer Elsie,' he said, 'was brought hither by the good magic of\r\nour Chief Mage and Prime Minister. She has removed the enchantment that\r\nheld us; and the dragon, now that he has had his tea and recovered from\r\nthe shock of being kindly treated, turns out to be the second strongest\r\nmagician in the world,--and he will help us and advise us, so long as we\r\nremember that we are all brothers and fellow-workers. And now comes the\r\ntime when our Elsie must return to her own place, or another go in her\r\nstead. But we cannot send back our heroine, our deliverer.' (_Long, loud\r\ncheering._) 'So one shall take her place. My daughter----'\r\n\r\nThe end of the sentence was lost in shouts of admiration. But Elsie\r\nstood up, small and white in her black frock, and said, 'No thank you.\r\nPerdona would simply hate it. And she doesn't know my daddy. He'll fetch\r\nme away from Mrs. Staines some day....'\r\n\r\nThe thought of her daddy, far away in India, of the loneliness of Willow\r\nFarm, where now it would be night in that horrible bare attic where the\r\npoor dead untameable little mouse was, nearly choked Elsie. It was so\r\nbright and light and good and kind here. And India was so far away. Her\r\nvoice stayed a moment on a broken note.\r\n\r\n'I--I....' Then she spoke firmly.\r\n\r\n'Thank you all so much,' she said--'so very much. I do love you all, and\r\nit's lovely here. But, please, I'd like to go home now.'\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, in a silence full of love and understanding, folded\r\nhis dark cloak round her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was dark in the attic. Elsie crouching alone in the blackness by the\r\nfireplace where the dead mouse had been, put out her hand to touch its\r\ncold fur.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were wheels on the gravel outside--the knocker swung\r\nstrongly--'_Rat_-tat-tat-tat--_Tat_! _Tat_!' A pause--voices--hasty feet\r\nin strong boots sounded on the stairs, the key turned in the lock. The\r\ndoor opened a dazzling crack, then fully, to the glare of a lamp\r\ncarried by Mrs. Staines.\r\n\r\n'Come down at once. I'm sure you're good now,' she said, in a great\r\nhurry and in a new honeyed voice.\r\n\r\nBut there were other feet on the stairs--a step that Elsie knew.\r\n'Where's my girl?' the voice she knew cried cheerfully. But under the\r\ncheerfulness Elsie heard something other and dearer. 'Where's my girl?'\r\n\r\nAfter all, it takes less than a month to come from India to the house in\r\nEngland where one's heart is.\r\n\r\nOut of the bare attic and the darkness Elsie leapt into light, into arms\r\nshe knew. 'Oh, my daddy, my daddy!' she cried. 'How glad I am I came\r\nback!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE RELATED MUFF\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had never seen our cousin Sidney till that Christmas Eve, and we\r\ndidn't want to see him then, and we didn't like him when we did see\r\nhim. He was just dumped down into the middle of us by mother, at a time\r\nwhen it would have been unkind to her to say how little we wanted him.\r\n\r\nWe knew already that there wasn't to be any proper Christmas for us,\r\nbecause Aunt Ellie--the one who always used to send the necklaces and\r\ncarved things from India, and remembered everybody's birthday--had come\r\nhome ill. Very ill she was, at a hotel in London, and mother had to go\r\nto her, and, of course, father was away with his ship.\r\n\r\nAnd then after we had said good-bye to mother, and told her how sorry we\r\nwere, we were left to ourselves, and told each other what a shame it\r\nwas, and no presents or anything. And then mother came suddenly back in\r\na cab, and we all shouted 'Hooray' when we saw the cab stop, and her get\r\nout of it. And then we saw she was getting something out of the cab, and\r\nour hearts leapt up like the man's in the piece of school poetry when he\r\nbeheld a rainbow in the sky--because we thought she had remembered about\r\nthe presents, and the thing she was getting out of the cab was _them_.\r\n\r\nOf course it was not--it was Sidney, very thin and yellow, and looking\r\nas sullen as a pig.\r\n\r\nWe opened the front door. Mother didn't even come in. She just said,\r\n'Here's your Cousin Sidney. Be nice to him and give him a good time,\r\nthere's darlings. And don't forget he's your visitor, so be very extra\r\nnice to him.'\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought it was the fault of what mother said about the\r\nvisitor that made what did happen happen, but I am almost sure really\r\nthat it was the fault of us, though I did not see it at the time, and\r\neven now I'm sure we didn't mean to be unkind. Quite the opposite. But\r\nthe events of life are very confusing, especially when you try to think\r\nwhat made you do them, and whether you really meant to be naughty or\r\nnot. Quite often it is not--but it turns out just the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the cab had carried mother away--Hilda said it was like a dragon\r\ncarrying away a queen--we said, 'How do you do' to our Cousin Sidney,\r\nwho replied, 'Quite well, thank you.'\r\n\r\nAnd then, curiously enough, no one could think of anything more to say.\r\n\r\nThen Rupert--which is me--remembered that about being a visitor, and he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Won't you come into the drawing-room?'\r\n\r\nHe did when he had taken off his gloves and overcoat. There was a fire\r\nin the drawing-room, because we had been going to have games there with\r\nmother, only the telegram came about Aunt Ellie.\r\n\r\nSo we all sat on chairs in the drawing-room, and thought of nothing to\r\nsay harder than ever.\r\n\r\nHilda did say, 'How old are you?' but, of course, we knew the answer to\r\nthat. It was ten.\r\n\r\nAnd Hugh said, 'Do you like England or India best?'\r\n\r\nAnd our cousin replied, 'India ever so much, thank you.'\r\n\r\nI never felt such a duffer. It was awful. With all the millions of\r\ninteresting things that there are to say at other times, and I couldn't\r\nthink of one. At last I said, 'Do you like games?'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: So we all sat on chairs in the drawing-room, and thought\r\nof nothing to say harder than ever.]\r\n\r\nAnd our cousin replied, 'Some games I do,' in a tone that made me sure\r\nthat the games he liked wouldn't be our kind, but some wild Indian sort\r\nthat we didn't know.\r\n\r\nI could see that the others were feeling just like me, and I knew we\r\ncould not go on like this till tea-time. And yet I didn't see any other\r\nway to go on in. It was Hilda who cut the Gorgeous knot at last. She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Hugh, let you and I go and make a lovely surprise for Rupert and\r\nSidney.'\r\n\r\nAnd before I could think of any way of stopping them without being\r\ndownright rude to our new cousin, they had fled the scene, just like any\r\nold conspirators. Rupert--me, I mean--was left alone with the stranger.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n'Is there anything you'd like to do?'\r\n\r\nAnd he said, 'No, thank you.'\r\n\r\nThen neither of us said anything for a bit--and I could hear the others\r\nshrieking with laughter in the hall.\r\n\r\nI said, 'I wonder what the surprise will be like.'\r\n\r\nHe said, 'Yes, I wonder'; but I could tell from his tone that he did not\r\nwonder a bit.\r\n\r\nThe others were yelling with laughter. Have you ever noticed how very\r\namused people always are when you're not there? If you're in bed--ill,\r\nor in disgrace, or anything--it always sounds like far finer jokes than\r\never occur when you are not out of things.\r\n\r\n'Do you like reading?' said I--who am Rupert--in the tones of despair.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the cousin.\r\n\r\n'Then take a book,' I said hastily, for I really could not stand it\r\nanother second, 'and you just read till the surprise is ready. I think I\r\nought to go and help the others. I'm the eldest, you know.'\r\n\r\nI did not wait--I suppose if you're ten you can choose a book for\r\nyourself--and I went.\r\n\r\nHilda's idea was just Indians, but I thought a wigwam would be nice. So\r\nwe made one with the hall table and the fur rugs off the floor. If\r\neverything had been different, and Aunt Ellie hadn't been ill, we were\r\nto have had turkey for dinner. The turkey's feathers were splendid for\r\nIndians, and the striped blankets off Hugh's and my beds, and all\r\nmother's beads. The hall is big like a room, and there was a fire. The\r\nafternoon passed like a beautiful dream. When Rupert had done his own\r\nfeathering and blanketing, as well as brown paper moccasins, he helped\r\nthe others. The tea-bell rang before we were quite dressed. We got\r\nLouisa to go up and tell our cousin that the surprise was ready, and we\r\nall got inside the wigwam. It was a very tight fit, with the feathers\r\nand the blankets.\r\n\r\nHe came down the stairs very slowly, reading all the time, and when he\r\ngot to the mat at the bottom of the stairs we burst forth in all our\r\nwar-paint from the wigwam. It upset, because Hugh and Hilda stuck\r\nbetween the table's legs, and it fell on the stone floor with quite a\r\nloud noise. The wild Indians picked themselves up out of the ruins and\r\ndid the finest war-dance I've ever seen in front of my cousin Sidney.\r\n\r\nHe gave one little scream, and then sat down suddenly on the bottom\r\nsteps. He leaned his head against the banisters and we thought he was\r\nadmiring the war-dance, till Eliza, who had been laughing and making as\r\nmuch noise as any one, suddenly went up to him and shook him.\r\n\r\n'Stop that noise,' she said to us, 'he's gone off into a dead faint.'\r\n\r\nHe had.\r\n\r\nOf course we were very sorry and all that, but we never thought he'd be\r\nsuch a muff as to be frightened of three Red Indians and a wigwam that\r\nhappened to upset. He was put to bed, and we had our teas.\r\n\r\n'I wish we hadn't,' Hilda said.\r\n\r\n'So do I,' said Hugh.\r\n\r\nBut Rupert said, 'No one _could_ have expected a cousin of ours to be a\r\nchicken-hearted duffer. He's a muff. It's bad enough to have a muff in\r\nthe house at all, and at Christmas time, too. But a related muff!'\r\n\r\nStill the affair had cast a gloom, and we were glad when it was\r\nbed-time.\r\n\r\nNext day was Christmas Day, and no presents, and nobody but the servants\r\nto wish a Merry Christmas to.\r\n\r\nOur cousin Sidney came down to breakfast, and as it was Christmas Day\r\nRupert bent his proud spirit to own he was sorry about the Indians.\r\n\r\nSidney said, 'It doesn't matter. I'm sorry too. Only I didn't expect\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nWe suggested two or three games, such as Parlour Cricket, National\r\nGallery, and Grab--but Sidney said he would rather read. So we said\r\nwould he mind if we played out the Indian game which we had dropped, out\r\nof politeness, when he fainted.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n'I don't mind at all, now I know what it is you're up to. No, thank you,\r\nI'd rather read,' he added, in reply to Rupert's unselfish offer to\r\ndress him for the part of Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\nSo he read _Treasure Island_, and we fought on the stairs with no\r\ncasualties except the gas globes, and then we scalped all the\r\ndolls--putting on paper scalps first because Hilda wished it--and we\r\nscalped Eliza as she passed through the hall--hers was a white scalp\r\nwith lacey stuff on it and long streamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'We scalped Eliza as she passed through the hall.']\r\n\r\nAnd when it was beginning to get dark we thought of flying machines. Of\r\ncourse Sidney wouldn't play at that either, and Hilda and Hugh were\r\ncontented with paper wings--there were some rolls of rather decent\r\nyellow and pink crinkled paper that mother had bought to make lamp\r\nshades of. They made wings of this, and then they played at fairies up\r\nand down the stairs, while Sidney sat at the bottom of the stairs and\r\nwent on reading _Treasure Island_. But Rupert was determined to have a\r\nflying machine, with real flipper-flappery wings, like at Hendon. So he\r\ngot two brass fire-guards out of the spare room and mother's bedroom,\r\nand covered them with newspapers fastened on with string. Then he got a\r\ntea-tray and fastened it on to himself with rug-straps, and then he\r\nslipped his arms in between the string and the fire-guards, and went to\r\nthe top of the stairs and shouting, 'Look out below there! Beware Flying\r\nMachines!' he sat down suddenly on the tray, and tobogganed gloriously\r\ndown the stairs, flapping his fire-guard wings. It was a great success,\r\nand felt more like flying than anything he ever played at. But Hilda had\r\nnot had time to look out thoroughly, because he did not wait any time\r\nbetween his warning and his descent. So that she was still fluttering,\r\nin the character of Queen of the Butterfly Fairies, about half-way down\r\nthe stairs when the flying machine, composed of the two guards, the\r\ntea-tray, and Rupert, started from the top of them, and she could only\r\nget out of the way by standing back close against the wall. Unluckily\r\nthe place where she was, was also the place where the gas was burning in\r\na little recess. You remember we had broken the globe when we were\r\nplaying Indians.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, you know what happened, because you have read _Harriett\r\nand the Matches_, and all the rest of the stories that have been written\r\nto persuade children not to play with fire. No one was playing with fire\r\nthat day, it is true, or doing anything really naughty at all--but\r\nhowever naughty we had been the thing that happened couldn't have been\r\nmuch worse. For the flying machine as it came rushing round the curve of\r\nthe staircase banged against the legs of Hilda. She screamed and\r\nstumbled back. Her pink paper wings went into the gas that hadn't a\r\nglobe. They flamed up, her hair frizzled, and her lace collar caught\r\nfire. Rupert could not do anything because he was held fast in his\r\nflying machine, and he and it were rolling painfully on the mat at the\r\nbottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sidney threw the rug over her, and rolled her over and\r\nover.]\r\n\r\nHilda screamed.\r\n\r\nI have since heard that a great yellow light fell on the pages of\r\n_Treasure Island_.\r\n\r\nNext moment _Treasure Island_ went spinning across the room. Sidney\r\ncaught up the fur rug that was part of the wigwam, and as Hilda,\r\nscreaming horribly, and with wings not of paper but of flames, rushed\r\ndown the staircase, and stumbled over the flying machine, Sidney threw\r\nthe rug over her, and rolled her over and over on the floor.\r\n\r\n'Lie down!' he cried. 'Lie down! It's the only way.'\r\n\r\nBut somehow people never will lie down when their clothes are on fire,\r\nany more than they will lie still in the water if they think they are\r\ndrowning, and some one is trying to save them. It came to something very\r\nlike a fight. Hilda fought and struggled. Rupert got out of his\r\nfire-guards and added himself and his tea-tray to the scrimmage. Hugh\r\nslid down to the knob of the banisters and sat there yelling. The\r\nservants came rushing in.\r\n\r\nBut by that time the fire was out. And Sidney gasped out, 'It's all\r\nright. You aren't burned, Hilda, are you?'\r\n\r\nHilda was much too frightened to know whether she was burnt or not, but\r\nEliza looked her over, and it turned out that only her neck was a little\r\nscorched, and a good deal of her hair frizzled off short.\r\n\r\nEvery one stood, rather breathless and pale, and every one's face was\r\nmuch dirtier than customary, except Hugh's, which he had, as usual,\r\ndirtied thoroughly quite early in the afternoon. Rupert felt perfectly\r\nawful, ashamed and proud and rather sick. 'You're a regular hero,\r\nSidney,' he said--and it was not easy to say--'and yesterday I said you\r\nwere a related muff. And I'm jolly sorry I did. Shake hands, won't you?'\r\n\r\nSidney hesitated.\r\n\r\n'Too proud?' Rupert's feelings were hurt, and I should not wonder if he\r\nspoke rather fiercely.\r\n\r\n'It's--it's a little burnt, I think,' said Sidney, 'don't be angry,' and\r\nhe held out the left hand.\r\n\r\nRupert grasped it.\r\n\r\n'I do beg your pardon,' he said, 'you _are_ a hero!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSidney's hand was bad for ever so long, but we were tremendous chums\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nIt was when they'd done the hand up with scraped potato and salad oil--a\r\ngreat, big, fat, wet plaster of it--that I said to him:\r\n\r\n'I don't care if you don't like games. Let's be pals.'\r\n\r\nAnd he said, 'I do like games, but I couldn't care about anything with\r\nmother so ill. I know you'll think I'm a muff, but I'm not really, only\r\nI do love her so.'\r\n\r\nAnd with that he began to cry, and I thumped him on the back, and told\r\nhim exactly what a beast I knew I was, to comfort him.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Ellie was well again we kept Christmas on the 6th of January,\r\nwhich used to be Christmas Day in middle-aged times.\r\n\r\nFather came home before New Year, and he had a silver medal made, with a\r\nflame on one side, and on the other Sidney's name, and 'For Bravery.'\r\n\r\nIf I had not been tied up in fire-guards and tea-trays perhaps I should\r\nhave thought of the rug and got the medal. But I do not grudge it to\r\nSidney. He deserved it. And he is not a muff. I see now that a person\r\nmight very well be frightened at finding Indians in the hall of a\r\nstrange house, especially if the person had just come from the kind of\r\nIndia where the Indians are quite a different sort, and much milder,\r\nwith no feathers and wigwams and war-dances, but only dusky features and\r\nUniversity Degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE AUNT AND AMABEL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to be a fish out of water. To be a cat in water is\r\nnot what any one would desire. To be in a temper is uncomfortable. And\r\nno one can fully taste the joys of life if he is in a Little Lord\r\nFauntleroy suit. But by far the most uncomfortable thing to be in is\r\ndisgrace, sometimes amusingly called Coventry by the people who are not\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nWe have all been there. It is a place where the heart sinks and aches,\r\nwhere familiar faces are clouded and changed, where any remark that one\r\nmay tremblingly make is received with stony silence or with the\r\nassurance that nobody wants to talk to such a naughty child. If you are\r\nonly in disgrace, and not in solitary confinement, you will creep about\r\na house that is like the one you have had such jolly times in, and yet\r\nas unlike it as a bad dream is to a June morning. You will long to speak\r\nto people, and be afraid to speak. You will wonder whether there is\r\nanything you can do that will change things at all. You have said you\r\nare sorry, and that has changed nothing. You will wonder whether you are\r\nto stay for ever in this desolate place, outside all hope and love and\r\nfun and happiness. And though it has happened before, and has always, in\r\nthe end, come to an end, you can never be quite sure that this time it\r\nis not going to last for ever.\r\n\r\n'It _is_ going to last for ever,' said Amabel, who was eight. 'What\r\nshall I do? Oh whatever shall I do?'\r\n\r\nWhat she _had_ done ought to have formed the subject of her\r\nmeditations. And she had done what had seemed to her all the time, and\r\nin fact still seemed, a self-sacrificing and noble act. She was staying\r\nwith an aunt--measles or a new baby, or the painters in the house, I\r\nforget which, the cause of her banishment. And the aunt, who was really\r\na great-aunt and quite old enough to know better, had been grumbling\r\nabout her head gardener to a lady who called in blue spectacles and a\r\nbeady bonnet with violet flowers in it.\r\n\r\n'He hardly lets me have a plant for the table,' said the aunt, 'and that\r\nborder in front of the breakfast-room window--it's just bare earth--and\r\nI expressly ordered chrysanthemums to be planted there. He thinks of\r\nnothing but his greenhouse.'\r\n\r\nThe beady-violet-blue-glassed lady snorted, and said she didn't know\r\nwhat we were coming to, and she would have just half a cup, please, with\r\nnot quite so much milk, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nNow what would you have done? Minded your own business most likely, and\r\nnot got into trouble at all. Not so Amabel. Enthusiastically anxious to\r\ndo something which should make the great-aunt see what a thoughtful,\r\nunselfish, little girl she really was (the aunt's opinion of her being\r\nat present quite otherwise), she got up very early in the morning and\r\ntook the cutting-out scissors from the work-room table drawer and stole,\r\n'like an errand of mercy,' she told herself, to the greenhouse where she\r\nbusily snipped off every single flower she could find. MacFarlane was at\r\nhis breakfast. Then with the points of the cutting-out scissors she made\r\nnice deep little holes in the flower-bed where the chrysanthemums ought\r\nto have been, and struck the flowers in--chrysanthemums, geraniums,\r\nprimulas, orchids, and carnations. It would be a lovely surprise for\r\nAuntie.\r\n\r\nThen the aunt came down to breakfast and saw the lovely surprise.\r\nAmabel's world turned upside down and inside out suddenly and\r\nsurprisingly, and there she was, in Coventry, and not even the housemaid\r\nwould speak to her. Her great-uncle, whom she passed in the hall on her\r\nway to her own room, did indeed, as he smoothed his hat, murmur, 'Sent\r\nto Coventry, eh? Never mind, it'll soon be over,' and went off to the\r\nCity banging the front door behind him.\r\n\r\nHe meant well, but he did not understand.\r\n\r\nAmabel understood, or she thought she did, and knew in her miserable\r\nheart that she was sent to Coventry for the last time, and that this\r\ntime she would stay there.\r\n\r\n'I don't care,' she said quite untruly. 'I'll never try to be kind to\r\nany one again.' And that wasn't true either. She was to spend the whole\r\nday alone in the best bedroom, the one with the four-post bed and the\r\nred curtains and the large wardrobe with a looking-glass in it that you\r\ncould see yourself in to the very ends of your strap-shoes.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Amabel did was to look at herself in the glass. She was\r\nstill sniffing and sobbing, and her eyes were swimming in tears, another\r\none rolled down her nose as she looked--that was very interesting.\r\nAnother rolled down, and that was the last, because as soon as you get\r\ninterested in watching your tears they stop.\r\n\r\nNext she looked out of the window, and saw the decorated flower-bed,\r\njust as she had left it, very bright and beautiful.\r\n\r\n'Well, it _does_ look nice,' she said. 'I don't care what they say.'\r\n\r\nThen she looked round the room for something to read; there was nothing.\r\nThe old-fashioned best bedrooms never did have anything. Only on the\r\nlarge dressing-table, on the left-hand side of the oval swing-glass,\r\nwas one book covered in red velvet, and on it, very twistily\r\nembroidered in yellow silk and mixed up with misleading leaves and\r\nsquiggles were the letters, A.B.C.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it's a picture alphabet,' said Mabel, and was quite pleased,\r\nthough of course she was much too old to care for alphabets. Only when\r\none is very unhappy and very dull, anything is better than nothing. She\r\nopened the book.\r\n\r\n'Why, it's only a time-table!' she said. 'I suppose it's for people when\r\nthey want to go away, and Auntie puts it here in case they suddenly make\r\nup their minds to go, and feel that they can't wait another minute. I\r\nfeel like that, only it's no good, and I expect other people do too.'\r\n\r\nShe had learned how to use the dictionary, and this seemed to go the\r\nsame way. She looked up the names of all the places she knew.--Brighton\r\nwhere she had once spent a month, Rugby where her brother was at school,\r\nand Home, which was Amberley--and she saw the times when the trains left\r\nfor these places, and wished she could go by those trains.\r\n\r\nAnd once more she looked round the best bedroom which was her prison,\r\nand thought of the Bastille, and wished she had a toad to tame, like the\r\npoor Viscount, or a flower to watch growing, like Picciola, and she was\r\nvery sorry for herself, and very angry with her aunt, and very grieved\r\nat the conduct of her parents--she had expected better things from\r\nthem--and now they had left her in this dreadful place where no one\r\nloved her, and no one understood her.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no place for toads or flowers in the best room, it\r\nwas carpeted all over even in its least noticeable corners. It had\r\neverything a best room ought to have--and everything was of dark shining\r\nmahogany. The toilet-table had a set of red and gold glass things--a\r\ntray, candlesticks, a ring-stand, many little pots with lids, and two\r\nbottles with stoppers. When the stoppers were taken out they smelt very\r\nstrange, something like very old scent, and something like cold cream\r\nalso very old, and something like going to the dentist's.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the scent of those bottles had anything to do with\r\nwhat happened. It certainly was a very extraordinary scent. Quite\r\ndifferent from any perfume that I smell nowadays, but I remember that\r\nwhen I was a little girl I smelt it quite often. But then there are no\r\nbest rooms now such as there used to be. The best rooms now are gay with\r\nchintz and mirrors, and there are always flowers and books, and little\r\ntables to put your teacup on, and sofas, and armchairs. And they smell\r\nof varnish and new furniture.\r\n\r\nWhen Amabel had sniffed at both bottles and looked in all the pots,\r\nwhich were quite clean and empty except for a pearl button and two pins\r\nin one of them, she took up the A.B.C. again to look for Whitby, where\r\nher godmother lived. And it was then that she saw the extraordinary name\r\n'_Whereyouwantogoto._' This was odd--but the name of the station from\r\nwhich it started was still more extraordinary, for it was not Euston or\r\nCannon Street or Marylebone.\r\n\r\nThe name of the station was '_Bigwardrobeinspareroom._' And below this\r\nname, really quite unusual for a station, Amabel read in small letters:\r\n\r\n'Single fares strictly forbidden. Return tickets No Class Nuppence.\r\nTrains leave _Bigwardrobeinspareroom_ all the time.'\r\n\r\nAnd under that in still smaller letters--\r\n\r\n'_You had better go now._'\r\n\r\nWhat would you have done? Rubbed your eyes and thought you were\r\ndreaming? Well, if you had, nothing more would have happened. Nothing\r\never does when you behave like that. Amabel was wiser. She went straight\r\nto the Big Wardrobe and turned its glass handle.\r\n\r\n'I expect it's only shelves and people's best hats,' she said. But she\r\nonly said it. People often say what they don't mean, so that if things\r\nturn out as they don't expect, they can say 'I told you so,' but this is\r\nmost dishonest to one's self, and being dishonest to one's self is\r\nalmost worse than being dishonest to other people. Amabel would never\r\nhave done it if she had been herself. But she was out of herself with\r\nanger and unhappiness.\r\n\r\nOf course it wasn't hats. It was, most amazingly, a crystal cave, very\r\noddly shaped like a railway station. It seemed to be lighted by stars,\r\nwhich is, of course, unusual in a booking office, and over the station\r\nclock was a full moon. The clock had no figures, only _Now_ in shining\r\nletters all round it, twelve times, and the _Nows_ touched, so the clock\r\nwas bound to be always right. How different from the clock you go to\r\nschool by!\r\n\r\nA porter in white satin hurried forward to take Amabel's luggage. Her\r\nluggage was the A.B.C. which she still held in her hand.\r\n\r\n'Lots of time, Miss,' he said, grinning in a most friendly way, 'I _am_\r\nglad you're going. You _will_ enjoy yourself! What a nice little girl\r\nyou are!'\r\n\r\nThis was cheering. Amabel smiled.\r\n\r\nAt the pigeon-hole that tickets come out of, another person, also in\r\nwhite satin, was ready with a mother-of-pearl ticket, round, like a card\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n'Here you are, Miss,' he said with the kindest smile, 'price nothing,\r\nand refreshments free all the way. It's a pleasure,' he added, 'to issue\r\na ticket to a nice little lady like you.' The train was entirely of\r\ncrystal, too, and the cushions were of white satin. There were little\r\nbuttons such as you have for electric bells, and on them\r\n'_Whatyouwantoeat_,' '_Whatyouwantodrink_,' '_Whatyouwantoread_,' in\r\nsilver letters.\r\n\r\nAmabel pressed all the buttons at once, and instantly felt obliged to\r\nblink. The blink over, she saw on the cushion by her side a silver tray\r\nwith vanilla ice, boiled chicken and white sauce, almonds (blanched),\r\npeppermint creams, and mashed potatoes, and a long glass of\r\nlemonade--beside the tray was a book. It was Mrs. Ewing's _Bad-tempered\r\nFamily_, and it was bound in white vellum.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more luxurious than eating while you read--unless it be\r\nreading while you eat. Amabel did both: they are not the same thing, as\r\nyou will see if you think the matter over.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the last thrill of the last spoonful of ice died away, and\r\nthe last full stop of the _Bad-tempered Family_ met Amabel's eye, the\r\ntrain stopped, and hundreds of railway officials in white velvet\r\nshouted, '_Whereyouwantogoto!_ Get out!'\r\n\r\nA velvety porter, who was somehow like a silkworm as well as like a\r\nwedding handkerchief sachet, opened the door.\r\n\r\n'Now!' he said, 'come on out, Miss Amabel, unless you want to go to\r\n_Whereyoudon'twantogoto_.'\r\n\r\nShe hurried out, on to an ivory platform.\r\n\r\n'Not on the ivory, if you please,' said the porter, 'the white Axminster\r\ncarpet--it's laid down expressly for you.'\r\n\r\nAmabel walked along it and saw ahead of her a crowd, all in white.\r\n\r\n'What's all that?' she asked the friendly porter.\r\n\r\n'It's the Mayor, dear Miss Amabel,' he said, 'with your address.'\r\n\r\n'My address is The Old Cottage, Amberley,' she said, 'at least it used\r\nto be'--and found herself face to face with the Mayor. He was very like\r\nUncle George, but he bowed low to her, which was not Uncle George's\r\nhabit, and said:\r\n\r\n'Welcome, dear little Amabel. Please accept this admiring address from\r\nthe Mayor and burgesses and apprentices and all the rest of it, of\r\nWhereyouwantogoto.'\r\n\r\nThe address was in silver letters, on white silk, and it said:\r\n\r\n'Welcome, dear Amabel. We know you meant to please your aunt. It was\r\nvery clever of you to think of putting the greenhouse flowers in the\r\nbare flower-bed. You couldn't be expected to know that you ought to ask\r\nleave before you touch other people's things.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, but,' said Amabel quite confused. 'I did....'\r\n\r\nBut the band struck up, and drowned her words. The instruments of the\r\nband were all of silver, and the bandsmen's clothes of white leather.\r\nThe tune they played was 'Cheero!'\r\n\r\nThen Amabel found that she was taking part in a procession, hand in hand\r\nwith the Mayor, and the band playing like mad all the time. The Mayor\r\nwas dressed entirely in cloth of silver, and as they went along he kept\r\nsaying, close to her ear.\r\n\r\n'You have our sympathy, you have our sympathy,' till she felt quite\r\ngiddy.\r\n\r\nThere was a flower show--all the flowers were white. There was a\r\nconcert--all the tunes were old ones. There was a play called _Put\r\nyourself in her place_. And there was a banquet, with Amabel in the\r\nplace of honour.\r\n\r\nThey drank her health in white wine whey, and then through the Crystal\r\nHall of a thousand gleaming pillars, where thousands of guests, all in\r\nwhite, were met to do honour to Amabel, the shout went up--'Speech,\r\nspeech!'\r\n\r\nI cannot explain to you what had been going on in Amabel's mind. Perhaps\r\nyou know. Whatever it was it began like a very tiny butterfly in a box,\r\nthat could not keep quiet, but fluttered, and fluttered, and fluttered.\r\nAnd when the Mayor rose and said:\r\n\r\n'Dear Amabel, you whom we all love and understand; dear Amabel, you who\r\nwere so unjustly punished for trying to give pleasure to an unresponsive\r\naunt; poor, ill-used, ill-treated, innocent Amabel; blameless, suffering\r\nAmabel, we await your words,' that fluttering, tiresome butterfly-thing\r\ninside her seemed suddenly to swell to the size and strength of a\r\nfluttering albatross, and Amabel got up from her seat of honour on the\r\nthrone of ivory and silver and pearl, and said, choking a little, and\r\nextremely red about the ears--\r\n\r\n'Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to make a speech, I just want to\r\nsay, \"Thank you,\" and to say--to say--to say....'\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and all the white crowd cheered.\r\n\r\n'To say,' she went on as the cheers died down, 'that I wasn't blameless,\r\nand innocent, and all those nice things. I ought to have thought. And\r\nthey _were_ Auntie's flowers. But I did want to please her. It's all so\r\nmixed. Oh, I wish Auntie was here!'\r\n\r\nAnd instantly Auntie _was_ there, very tall and quite nice-looking, in a\r\nwhite velvet dress and an ermine cloak.\r\n\r\n'Speech,' cried the crowd. 'Speech from Auntie!'\r\n\r\nAuntie stood on the step of the throne beside Amabel, and said:\r\n\r\n'I think, perhaps, I was hasty. And I think Amabel meant to please me.\r\nBut all the flowers that were meant for the winter ... well--I was\r\nannoyed. I'm sorry.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Auntie, so am I--so am I,' cried Amabel, and the two began to hug\r\neach other on the ivory step, while the crowd cheered like mad, and the\r\nband struck up that well-known air, 'If you only understood!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Auntie,' said Amabel among hugs, 'This is such a lovely place, come\r\nand see everything, we may, mayn't we?' she asked the Mayor.\r\n\r\n'The place is yours,' he said, 'and now you can see many things that\r\nyou couldn't see before. We are The People who Understand. And now you\r\nare one of Us. And your aunt is another.'\r\n\r\nI must not tell you all that they saw because these things are secrets\r\nonly known to The People who Understand, and perhaps you do not yet\r\nbelong to that happy nation. And if you do, you will know without my\r\ntelling you.\r\n\r\nAnd when it grew late, and the stars were drawn down, somehow, to hang\r\namong the trees, Amabel fell asleep in her aunt's arms beside a white\r\nfoaming fountain on a marble terrace, where white peacocks came to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe awoke on the big bed in the spare room, but her aunt's arms were\r\nstill round her.\r\n\r\n'Amabel,' she was saying, 'Amabel!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Auntie,' said Amabel sleepily, 'I am so sorry. It _was_ stupid of\r\nme. And I did mean to please you.'\r\n\r\n'It _was_ stupid of you,' said the aunt, 'but I am sure you meant to\r\nplease me. Come down to supper.' And Amabel has a confused recollection\r\nof her aunt's saying that she was sorry, adding, 'Poor little Amabel.'\r\n\r\nIf the aunt really did say it, it was fine of her. And Amabel is quite\r\nsure that she did say it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmabel and her great-aunt are now the best of friends. But neither of\r\nthem has ever spoken to the other of the beautiful city called\r\n'_Whereyouwantogoto._' Amabel is too shy to be the first to mention it,\r\nand no doubt the aunt has her own reasons for not broaching the subject.\r\n\r\nBut of course they both know that they have been there together, and it\r\nis easy to get on with people when you and they alike belong to the\r\n_Peoplewhounderstand_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you look in the A.B.C. that your people have you will not find\r\n'_Whereyouwantogoto._' It is only in the red velvet bound copy that\r\nAmabel found in her aunt's best bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nKENNETH AND THE CARP\r\n\r\n\r\nKenneth's cousins had often stayed with him, but he had never till now\r\nstayed with them. And you know how different everything is when you are\r\nin your own house. You are certain exactly what games the grown-ups\r\ndislike and what games they will not notice; also what sort of mischief\r\nis looked over and what sort is not. And, being accustomed to your own\r\nsort of grown-ups, you can always be pretty sure when you are likely to\r\ncatch it. Whereas strange houses are, in this matter of catching it,\r\nfull of the most unpleasing surprises.\r\n\r\nYou know all this. But Kenneth did not. And still less did he know what\r\nwere the sort of things which, in his cousins' house, led to\r\ndisapproval, punishment, scoldings; in short, to catching it. So that\r\nthat business of cousin Ethel's jewel-case, which is where this story\r\nought to begin, was really not Kenneth's fault at all. Though for a\r\ntime.... But I am getting on too fast.\r\n\r\nKenneth's cousins were four,--Conrad, Alison, George, and Ethel. The\r\nthree first were natural sort of cousins somewhere near his own age, but\r\nEthel was hardly like a cousin at all, more like an aunt. Because she\r\nwas grown-up. She wore long dresses and all her hair on the top of her\r\nhead, a mass of combs and hairpins; in fact she had just had her\r\ntwenty-first birthday with iced cakes and a party and lots of presents,\r\nmost of them jewelry. And that brings me again to that affair of the\r\njewel-case, or would bring me if I were not determined to tell things in\r\ntheir proper order, which is the first duty of a story-teller.\r\n\r\nKenneth's home was in Kent, a wooden house among cherry orchards, and\r\nthe nearest river five miles away. That was why he looked forward in\r\nsuch a very extra and excited way to his visit to his cousins. Their\r\nhouse was very old, red brick with ivy all over it. It had a secret\r\nstaircase, only the secret was not kept any longer, and the housemaids\r\ncarried pails and brooms up and down the staircase. And the house was\r\nsurrounded by a real deep moat, with clear water in it, and long weeds\r\nand water-lilies and fish--the gold and the silver and the everyday\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early next morning he tried to catch fish with several\r\npieces of string knotted together and a hairpin.]\r\n\r\nThe first evening of Kenneth's visit passed uneventfully. His bedroom\r\nwindow looked over the moat, and early next morning he tried to catch\r\nfish with several pieces of string knotted together and a hairpin kindly\r\nlent to him by the parlourmaid. He did not catch any fish, partly\r\nbecause he baited the hairpin with brown windsor soap, and it washed\r\noff.\r\n\r\n'Besides, fish hate soap,' Conrad told him, 'and that hook of yours\r\nwould do for a whale perhaps. Only we don't stock our moat with whales.\r\nBut I'll ask father to lend you his rod, it's a spiffing one, much\r\njollier than ours. And I won't tell the kids because they'd never let it\r\ndown on you. Fishing with a hairpin!'\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much,' said Kenneth, feeling that his cousin was a man\r\nand a brother. The kids were only two or three years younger than he\r\nwas, but that is a great deal when you are the elder; and besides, one\r\nof the kids was a girl.\r\n\r\n'Alison's a bit of a sneak,' Conrad used to say when anger overcome\r\npoliteness and brotherly feeling. Afterwards, when the anger was gone\r\nand the other things left, he would say, 'You see she went to a beastly\r\nschool for a bit, at Brighton, for her health. And father says they must\r\nhave bullied her. All girls are not like it, I believe.'\r\n\r\nBut her sneakish qualities, if they really existed, were generally\r\nhidden, and she was very clever at thinking of new games, and very kind\r\nif you got into a row over anything.\r\n\r\nGeorge was eight and stout. He was not a sneak, but concealment was\r\nforeign to his nature, so he never could keep a secret unless he forgot\r\nit. Which fortunately happened quite often.\r\n\r\nThe uncle very amiably lent Kenneth his fishing-rod, and provided real\r\nbait in the most thoughtful and generous manner. And the four children\r\nfished all the morning and all the afternoon. Conrad caught two roach\r\nand an eel. George caught nothing, and nothing was what the other two\r\ncaught. But it was glorious sport. And the next day there was to be a\r\npicnic. Life to Kenneth seemed full of new and delicious excitement.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the aunt and the uncle went out to dinner, and Ethel, in\r\nher grown-up way, went with them, very grand in a blue silk dress and\r\nturquoises. So the children were left to themselves.\r\n\r\nYou know the empty hush which settles down on a house when the grown-ups\r\nhave gone out to dinner and you have the whole evening to do what you\r\nlike in. The children stood in the hall a moment after the carriage\r\nwheels had died away with the scrunching swish that the carriage wheels\r\nalways made as they turned the corner by the lodge, where the gravel was\r\nextra thick and soft owing to the droppings from the trees. From the\r\nkitchen came the voices of the servants, laughing and talking.\r\n\r\n'It's two hours at least to bedtime,' said Alison. 'What shall we do?'\r\nAlison always began by saying 'What shall we do?' and always ended by\r\ndeciding what should be done. 'You all say what you think,' she went\r\non, 'and then we'll vote about it. You first, Ken, because you're the\r\nvisitor.'\r\n\r\n'Fishing,' said Kenneth, because it was the only thing he could think\r\nof.\r\n\r\n'Make toffee,' said Conrad.\r\n\r\n'Build a great big house with all the bricks,' said George.\r\n\r\n'We can't make toffee,' Alison explained gently but firmly, 'because you\r\nknow what the pan was like last time, and cook said, \"never again, not\r\nmuch.\" And it's no good building houses, Georgie, when you could be out\r\nof doors. And fishing's simply rotten when we've been at it all day.\r\nI've thought of something.'\r\n\r\nSo of course all the others said, 'What?'\r\n\r\n'We'll have a pageant, a river pageant, on the moat. We'll all dress up\r\nand hang Chinese lanterns in the trees. I'll be the Sunflower lady that\r\nthe Troubadour came all across the sea, because he loved her so, for,\r\nand one of you can be the Troubadour, and the others can be sailors or\r\nanything you like.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be the Troubadour,' said Conrad with decision.\r\n\r\n'I think you ought to let Kenneth because he's the visitor,' said\r\nGeorge, who would have liked to be it immensely himself, or anyhow did\r\nnot see why Conrad should be a troubadour if _he_ couldn't.\r\n\r\nConrad said what manners required, which was:\r\n\r\n'Oh! all right, I don't care about being the beastly Troubadour.'\r\n\r\n'You might be the Princess's brother,' Alison suggested.\r\n\r\n'Not me,' said Conrad scornfully, 'I'll be the captain of the ship.'\r\n\r\n'In a turban the brother would be, with the Benares cloak, and the\r\nPersian dagger out of the cabinet in the drawing-room,' Alison went on\r\nunmoved.\r\n\r\n'I'll be that,' said George.\r\n\r\n'No, you won't, I shall, so there,' said Conrad. 'You can be the captain\r\nof the ship.'\r\n\r\n(But in the end both boys were captains, because that meant being on the\r\nboat, whereas being the Princess's brother, however turbanned, only\r\nmeant standing on the bank. And there is no rule to prevent captains\r\nwearing turbans and Persian daggers, except in the Navy where, of\r\ncourse, it is not done.)\r\n\r\nSo then they all tore up to the attic where the dressing-up trunk was,\r\nand pulled out all the dressing-up things on to the floor. And all the\r\ntime they were dressing, Alison was telling the others what they were to\r\nsay and do. The Princess wore a white satin skirt and a red flannel\r\nblouse and a veil formed of several motor scarves of various colours.\r\nAlso a wreath of pink roses off one of Ethel's old hats, and a pair of\r\npink satin slippers with sparkly buckles.\r\n\r\nKenneth wore a blue silk dressing-jacket and a yellow sash, a lace\r\ncollar, and a towel turban. And the others divided between them an\r\neastern dressing-gown, once the property of their grandfather, a black\r\nspangled scarf, very holey, a pair of red and white football stockings,\r\na Chinese coat, and two old muslin curtains, which, rolled up, made\r\nturbans of enormous size and fierceness.\r\n\r\nOn the landing outside cousin Ethel's open door Alison paused and said,\r\n'I say!'\r\n\r\n'Oh! come on,' said Conrad, 'we haven't fixed the Chinese lanterns yet,\r\nand it's getting dark.'\r\n\r\n'You go on,' said Alison, 'I've just thought of something.'\r\n\r\nThe children were allowed to play in the boat so long as they didn't\r\nloose it from its moorings. The painter was extremely long, and quite\r\nthe effect of coming home from a long voyage was produced when the three\r\nboys pushed the boat out as far as it would go among the boughs of the\r\nbeech-tree which overhung the water, and then reappeared in the circle\r\nof red and yellow light thrown by the Chinese lanterns.\r\n\r\n'What ho! ashore there!' shouted the captain.\r\n\r\n'What ho!' said a voice from the shore which, Alison explained, was\r\ndisguised.\r\n\r\n'We be three poor mariners,' said Conrad by a happy effort of memory,\r\n'just newly come to shore. We seek news of the Princess of Tripoli.'\r\n\r\n'She's in her palace,' said the disguised voice, 'wait a minute, and\r\nI'll tell her you're here. But what do you want her for? (\"A poor\r\nminstrel of France\") go on, Con.'\r\n\r\n'A poor minstrel of France,' said Conrad, '(all right! I remember,) who\r\nhas heard of the Princess's beauty has come to lay, to lay----'\r\n\r\n'His heart,' said Alison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A radiant vision stepped into the circle of light.]\r\n\r\n'All right, I know. His heart at her something or other feet.'\r\n\r\n'Pretty feet,' said Alison. 'I go to tell the Princess.'\r\n\r\nNext moment from the shadows on the bank a radiant vision stepped into\r\nthe circle of light, crying--\r\n\r\n'Oh! Rudel, is it indeed thou? Thou art come at last. O welcome to the\r\narms of the Princess!'\r\n\r\n'What do I do now?' whispered Rudel (who was Kenneth) in the boat, and\r\nat the same moment Conrad and George said, as with one voice--\r\n\r\n'My hat! Alison, won't you catch it!'\r\n\r\nFor at the end of the Princess's speech she had thrown back her veils\r\nand revealed a blaze of splendour. She wore several necklaces, one of\r\nseed pearls, one of topazes, and one of Australian shells, besides a\r\nstring of amber and one of coral. And the front of the red flannel\r\nblouse was studded with brooches, in one at least of which diamonds\r\ngleamed. Each arm had one or two bracelets and on her clenched hands\r\nglittered as many rings as any Princess could wish to wear.\r\n\r\nSo her brothers had some excuse for saying, 'You'll catch it.'\r\n\r\n'No, I sha'n't. It's my look out, anyhow. Do shut up,' said the\r\nPrincess, stamping her foot. 'Now then, Ken, go ahead. Ken, you say, \"Oh\r\nLady, I faint with rapture!\"'\r\n\r\n'I faint with rapture,' said Kenneth stolidly. 'Now I land, don't I?'\r\n\r\nHe landed and stared at the jewelled hand the Princess held out.\r\n\r\n'At last, at last,' she said, 'but you ought to say that, Ken. I say, I\r\nthink I'd better be an eloping Princess, and then I can come in the\r\nboat. Rudel dies really, but that's so dull. Lead me to your ship, oh\r\nnoble stranger! for you have won the Princess, and with you I will live\r\nand die. Give me your hand, can't you, silly, and do mind my train.'\r\n\r\nSo Kenneth led her to the boat, and with some difficulty, for the satin\r\ntrain got between her feet, she managed to flounder into the punt.\r\n\r\n'Now you stand and bow,' she said. 'Fair Rudel, with this ring I thee\r\nwed,' she pressed a large amethyst ring into his hand, 'remember that\r\nthe Princess of Tripoli is yours for ever. Now let's sing _Integer\r\nVitae_ because it's Latin.'\r\n\r\nSo they sat in the boat and sang. And presently the servants came out to\r\nlisten and admire, and at the sound of the servants' approach the\r\nPrincess veiled her shining splendour.\r\n\r\n'It's prettier than wot the Coventry pageant was, so it is,' said the\r\ncook, 'but it's long past your bed times. So come on out of that there\r\ndangerous boat, there's dears.'\r\n\r\nSo then the children went to bed. And when the house was quiet again,\r\nAlison slipped down and put back Ethel's jewelry, fitting the things\r\ninto their cases and boxes as correctly as she could. 'Ethel won't\r\nnotice,' she thought, but of course Ethel did.\r\n\r\nSo that next day each child was asked separately by Ethel's mother who\r\nhad been playing with Ethel's jewelry. And Conrad and George said they\r\nwould rather not say. This was a form they always used in that family\r\nwhen that sort of question was asked, and it meant, 'It wasn't me, and I\r\ndon't want to sneak.'\r\n\r\nAnd when it came to Alison's turn, she found to her surprise and horror\r\nthat instead of saying, 'I played with them,' she had said, 'I would\r\nrather not say.'\r\n\r\nOf course the mother thought that it was Kenneth who had had the jewels\r\nto play with. So when it came to his turn he was not asked the same\r\nquestion as the others, but his aunt said:\r\n\r\n'Kenneth, you are a very naughty little boy to take your cousin Ethel's\r\njewelry to play with.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't,' said Kenneth.\r\n\r\n'Hush! hush!' said the aunt, 'do not make your fault worse by\r\nuntruthfulness. And what have you done with the amethyst ring?'\r\n\r\nKenneth was just going to say that he had given it back to Alison, when\r\nhe saw that this would be sneakish. So he said, getting hot to the ears,\r\n'You don't suppose I've stolen your beastly ring, do you, Auntie?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you dare to speak to me like that,' the aunt very naturally\r\nreplied. 'No, Kenneth, I do not think you would steal, but the ring is\r\nmissing and it must be found.'\r\n\r\nKenneth was furious and frightened. He stood looking down and kicking\r\nthe leg of the chair.\r\n\r\n'You had better look for it. You will have plenty of time, because I\r\nshall not allow you to go to the picnic with the others. The mere taking\r\nof the jewelry was wrong, but if you had owned your fault and asked\r\nEthel's pardon, I should have overlooked it. But you have told me an\r\nuntruth and you have lost the ring. You are a very wicked child, and it\r\nwill make your dear mother very unhappy when she hears of it. That her\r\nboy should be a liar. It is worse than being a thief!'\r\n\r\nAt this Kenneth's fortitude gave way, and he lost his head. 'Oh, don't,'\r\nhe said, 'I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. Oh! don't tell mother I'm a\r\nthief and a liar. Oh! Aunt Effie, please, _please_ don't.' And with that\r\nhe began to cry.\r\n\r\nAny doubts Aunt Effie might have had were settled by this outbreak. It\r\nwas now quite plain to her that Kenneth had really intended to keep the\r\nring.\r\n\r\n'You will remain in your room till the picnic party has started,' the\r\naunt went on, 'and then you must find the ring. Remember I expect it to\r\nbe found when I return. And I hope you will be in a better frame of mind\r\nand really sorry for having been so wicked.'\r\n\r\n'Mayn't I see Alison?' was all he found to say.\r\n\r\nAnd the answer was, 'Certainly not. I cannot allow you to associate with\r\nyour cousins. You are not fit to be with honest, truthful children.'\r\n\r\nSo they all went to the picnic, and Kenneth was left alone. When they\r\nhad gone he crept down and wandered furtively through the empty rooms,\r\nashamed to face the servants, and feeling almost as wicked as though he\r\nhad really done something wrong. He thought about it all, over and over\r\nagain, and the more he thought the more certain he was that he _had_\r\nhanded back the ring to Alison last night when the voices of the\r\nservants were first heard from the dark lawn.\r\n\r\nBut what was the use of saying so? No one would believe him, and it\r\nwould be sneaking anyhow. Besides, perhaps he _hadn't_ handed it back to\r\nher. Or rather, perhaps he had handed it and she hadn't taken it.\r\nPerhaps it had slipped into the boat. He would go and see.\r\n\r\nBut he did not find it in the boat, though he turned up the carpet and\r\neven took up the boards to look. And then an extremely miserable little\r\nboy began to search for an amethyst ring in all sorts of impossible\r\nplaces, indoors and out. You know the hopeless way in which you look for\r\nthings that you know perfectly well you will never find, the borrowed\r\npenknife that you dropped in the woods, for instance, or the week's\r\npocket-money which slipped through that hole in your pocket as you went\r\nto the village to spend it.\r\n\r\nThe servants gave him his meals and told him to cheer up. But cheering\r\nup and Kenneth were, for the time, strangers. People in books never can\r\neat when they are in trouble, but I have noticed myself that if the\r\ntrouble has gone on for some hours, eating is really rather a comfort.\r\nYou don't enjoy eating so much as usual, perhaps, but at any rate it is\r\nsomething to do, and takes the edge off your sorrow for a short time.\r\nAnd cook was sorry for Kenneth and sent him up a very nice dinner and a\r\nvery nice tea. Roast chicken and gooseberry pie the dinner was, and for\r\ntea there was cake with almond icing on it.\r\n\r\nThe sun was very low when he went back wearily to have one more look in\r\nthe boat for that detestable amethyst ring. Of course it was not there.\r\nAnd the picnic party would be home soon. And he really did not know what\r\nhis aunt would do to him.\r\n\r\n'Shut me up in a dark cupboard, perhaps,' he thought gloomily, 'or put\r\nme to bed all day to-morrow. Or give me lines to write out, thousands,\r\nand thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, of them.'\r\n\r\nThe boat, set in motion by his stepping into it, swung out to the full\r\nlength of its rope. The sun was shining almost level across the water.\r\nIt was a very still evening, and the reflections of the trees and of the\r\nhouse were as distinct as the house and the trees themselves. And the\r\nwater was unusually clear. He could see the fish swimming about, and the\r\nsand and pebbles at the bottom of the moat. How clear and quiet it\r\nlooked down there, and what fun the fishes seemed to be having.\r\n\r\n'I wish I was a fish,' said Kenneth. 'Nobody punishes _them_ for taking\r\nrings they _didn't_ take.'\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly he saw the ring itself, lying calm, and quiet, and\r\nround, and shining, on the smooth sand at the bottom of the moat.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the boat-hook and leaned over the edge of the boat trying\r\nto get up the ring on the boat-hook's point. Then there was a splash.\r\n\r\n'Good gracious! I wonder what that is?' said cook in the kitchen, and\r\ndropped the saucepan with the welsh rabbit in it which she had just made\r\nfor kitchen supper.\r\n\r\nKenneth had leaned out too far over the edge of the boat, the boat had\r\nsuddenly decided to go the other way, and Kenneth had fallen into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he felt was delicious coolness, the second that his\r\nclothes had gone, and the next thing he noticed was that he was swimming\r\nquite easily and comfortably under water, and that he had no trouble\r\nwith his breathing, such as people who tell you not to fall into water\r\nseem to expect you to have. Also he could see quite well, which he had\r\nnever been able to do under water before.\r\n\r\n'I can't think,' he said to himself, 'why people make so much fuss about\r\nyour falling into the water. I sha'n't be in a hurry to get out. I'll\r\nswim right round the moat while I'm about it.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There was a splash.]\r\n\r\nIt was a very much longer swim than he expected, and as he swam he\r\nnoticed one or two things that struck him as rather odd. One was that he\r\ncouldn't see his hands. And another was that he couldn't feel his feet.\r\nAnd he met some enormous fishes, like great cod or halibut, they seemed.\r\nHe had had no idea that there were fresh-water fish of that size.\r\n\r\nThey towered above him more like men-o'-war than fish, and he was\r\nrather glad to get past them. There were numbers of smaller fishes, some\r\nabout his own size, he thought. They seemed to be enjoying themselves\r\nextremely, and he admired the clever quickness with which they darted\r\nout of the way of the great hulking fish.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly he ran into something hard and very solid, and a voice\r\nabove him said crossly:\r\n\r\n'Now then, who are you a-shoving of? Can't you keep your eyes open, and\r\nkeep your nose out of gentlemen's shirt fronts?'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' said Kenneth, trying to rub his nose, and not being\r\nable to. 'I didn't know people could talk under water,' he added very\r\nmuch astonished to find that talking under water was as easy to him as\r\nswimming there.\r\n\r\n'Fish can talk under water, of course,' said the voice, 'if they didn't,\r\nthey'd never talk at all: they certainly can't talk _out_ of it.'\r\n\r\n'But I'm not a fish,' said Kenneth, and felt himself grin at the absurd\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n'Yes, you are,' said the voice, 'of course you're a fish,' and Kenneth,\r\nwith a shiver of certainty, felt that the voice spoke the truth. He\r\n_was_ a fish. He must have become a fish at the very moment when he fell\r\ninto the water. That accounted for his not being able to see his hands\r\nor feel his feet. Because of course his hands were fins and his feet\r\nwere a tail.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' he asked the voice, and his own voice trembled.\r\n\r\n'I'm the Doyen Carp,' said the voice. 'You must be a very new fish\r\nindeed or you'd know that. Come up, and let's have a look at you.'\r\n\r\nKenneth came up and found himself face to face with an enormous fish who\r\nhad round staring eyes and a mouth that opened and shut continually. It\r\nopened square like a kit-bag, and it shut with an extremely sour and\r\nsevere expression like that of an offended rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the Carp, 'you _are_ a new fish. Who put you in?'\r\n\r\n'I fell in,' said Kenneth, 'out of the boat, but I'm not a fish at all,\r\nreally I'm not. I'm a boy, but I don't suppose you'll believe me.'\r\n\r\n'Why shouldn't I believe you?' asked the Carp wagging a slow fin.\r\n'Nobody tells untruths under water.'\r\n\r\nAnd if you come to think of it, no one ever does.\r\n\r\n'Tell me your true story,' said the Carp very lazily. And Kenneth told\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'Ah! these humans!' said the Carp when he had done. 'Always in such a\r\nhurry to think the worst of everybody!' He opened his mouth squarely and\r\nshut it contemptuously. 'You're jolly lucky, you are. Not one boy in a\r\nmillion turns into a fish, let me tell you.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean that I've got to _go on_ being a fish?' Kenneth asked.\r\n\r\n'Of course you'll go on being a fish as long as you stop in the water.\r\nYou couldn't live here, you know, if you weren't.'\r\n\r\n'I might if I was an eel,' said Kenneth, and thought himself very\r\nclever.\r\n\r\n'Well, _be_ an eel then,' said the Carp, and swam away sneering and\r\nstately. Kenneth had to swim his hardest to catch up.\r\n\r\n'Then if I get out of the water, shall I be a boy again?' he asked\r\npanting.\r\n\r\n'Of course, silly,' said the Carp, 'only you can't get out.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! can't I?' said Kenneth the fish, whisked his tail and swam off. He\r\nwent straight back to the amethyst ring, picked it up in his mouth, and\r\nswam into the shallows at the edge of the moat. Then he tried to climb\r\nup the slanting mud and on to the grassy bank, but the grass hurt his\r\nfins horribly, and when he put his nose out of the water, the air\r\nstifled him, and he was glad to slip back again. Then he tried to jump\r\nout of the water, but he could only jump straight up into the air, so of\r\ncourse he fell straight down again into the water. He began to be\r\nafraid, and the thought that perhaps he was doomed to remain for ever a\r\nfish was indeed a terrible one. He wanted to cry, but the tears would\r\nnot come out of his eyes. Perhaps there was no room for any more water\r\nin the moat.\r\n\r\nThe smaller fishes called to him in a friendly jolly way to come and\r\nplay with them--they were having a quite exciting game of\r\nfollow-my-leader among some enormous water-lily stalks that looked like\r\ntrunks of great trees. But Kenneth had no heart for games just then.\r\n\r\nHe swam miserably round the moat looking for the old Carp, his only\r\nacquaintance in this strange wet world. And at last, pushing through a\r\nthick tangle of water weeds he found the great fish.\r\n\r\n'Now then,' said the Carp testily, 'haven't you any better manners than\r\nto come tearing a gentleman's bed-curtains like that?'\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon,' said Kenneth Fish, 'but I know how clever you are.\r\nDo please help me.'\r\n\r\n'What do you want now?' said the Carp, and spoke a little less crossly.\r\n\r\n'I want to get out. I want to go and be a boy again.'\r\n\r\n'But you must have said you wanted to be a fish.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean it, if I did.'\r\n\r\n'You shouldn't say what you don't mean.'\r\n\r\n'I'll try not to again,' said Kenneth humbly, 'but how can I get out?'\r\n\r\n'There's only one way,' said the Carp rolling his vast body over in his\r\nwatery bed, 'and a jolly unpleasant way it is. Far better stay here and\r\nbe a good little fish. On the honour of a gentleman that's the best\r\nthing you can do.'\r\n\r\n'I want to get out,' said Kenneth again.\r\n\r\n'Well then, the only way is ... you know we always teach the young fish\r\nto look out for hooks so that they may avoid them. _You_ must look out\r\nfor a hook and _take it_. Let them catch you. On a hook.'\r\n\r\nThe Carp shuddered and went on solemnly, 'Have you strength? Have you\r\npatience? Have you high courage and determination? You will want them\r\nall. Have you all these?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know what I've got,' said poor Kenneth, 'except that I've got a\r\ntail and fins, and I don't know a hook when I see it. Won't you come\r\nwith me? Oh! dear Mr. Doyen Carp, _do_ come and show me a hook.'\r\n\r\n'It will hurt you,' said the Carp, 'very much indeed. You take a\r\ngentleman's word for it.'\r\n\r\n'I know,' said Kenneth, 'you needn't rub it in.'\r\n\r\nThe Carp rolled heavily out of his bed.\r\n\r\n'Come on then,' he said, 'I don't admire your taste, but if you _want_ a\r\nhook, well, the gardener's boy is fishing in the cool of the evening.\r\nCome on.'\r\n\r\nHe led the way with a steady stately movement.\r\n\r\n'I want to take the ring with me,' said Kenneth, 'but I can't get hold\r\nof it. Do you think you could put it on my fin with your snout?'\r\n\r\n'My what!' shouted the old Carp indignantly and stopped dead.\r\n\r\n'Your nose, I meant,' said Kenneth. 'Oh! please don't be angry. It would\r\nbe so kind of you if you would. Shove the ring on, I mean.'\r\n\r\n'That will hurt too,' said the Carp, and Kenneth thought he seemed not\r\naltogether sorry that it should.\r\n\r\nIt did hurt very much indeed. The ring was hard and heavy, and somehow\r\nKenneth's fin would not fold up small enough for the ring to slip over\r\nit, and the Carp's big mouth was rather clumsy at the work. But at last\r\nit was done. And then they set out in search of a hook for Kenneth to be\r\ncaught with.\r\n\r\n'I wish we could find one! I wish we could!' Kenneth Fish kept saying.\r\n\r\n'You're just looking for trouble,' said the Carp. 'Well, here you are!'\r\n\r\nAbove them in the clear water hung a delicious-looking worm. Kenneth Boy\r\ndid not like worms any better than you do, but to Kenneth Fish that worm\r\nlooked most tempting and delightful.\r\n\r\n'Just wait a sec.,' he said, 'till I get that worm.'\r\n\r\n'You little silly,' said the Carp, '_that's the hook_. Take it.'\r\n\r\n'Wait a sec.,' said Kenneth again.\r\n\r\nHis courage was beginning to ooze out of his fin tips, and a shiver ran\r\ndown him from gills to tail.\r\n\r\n'If you once begin to think about a hook you never take it,' said the\r\nCarp.\r\n\r\n'_Never?_' said Kenneth 'Then ... oh! good-bye!' he cried desperately,\r\nand snapped at the worm. A sharp pain ran through his head and he felt\r\nhimself drawn up into the air, that stifling, choking, husky, thick\r\nstuff in which fish cannot breathe. And as he swung in the air the\r\ndreadful thought came to him, 'Suppose I don't turn into a boy again?\r\nSuppose I keep being a fish?' And then he wished he hadn't. But it was\r\ntoo late to wish that.\r\n\r\nEverything grew quite dark, only inside his head there seemed to be a\r\nlight. There was a wild, rushing, buzzing noise, then something in his\r\nhead seemed to break and he knew no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen presently he knew things again, he was lying on something hard. Was\r\nhe Kenneth Fish lying on a stone at the bottom of the moat, or Kenneth\r\nBoy lying somewhere out of the water? His breathing was all right, so he\r\nwasn't a fish out of water or a boy under it.\r\n\r\n'He's coming to,' said a voice. The Carp's he thought it was. But next\r\nmoment he knew it to be the voice of his aunt, and he moved his hand and\r\nfelt grass in it. He opened his eyes and saw above him the soft gray of\r\nthe evening sky with a star or two.\r\n\r\n'Here's the ring, Aunt,' he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'Oh, good-bye!' he cried desperately, and snapped at the\r\nworm.]\r\n\r\nThe cook had heard a splash and had run out just as the picnic party\r\narrived at the front door. They had all rushed to the moat, and the\r\nuncle had pulled Kenneth out with the boat-hook. He had not been in the\r\nwater more than three minutes, they said. But Kenneth knew better.\r\n\r\nThey carried him in, very wet he was, and laid him on the breakfast-room\r\nsofa, where the aunt with hurried thoughtfulness had spread out the\r\nuncle's mackintosh.\r\n\r\n'Get some rough towels, Jane,' said the aunt. 'Make haste, do.'\r\n\r\n'I got the ring,' said Kenneth.\r\n\r\n'Never mind about the ring, dear,' said the aunt, taking his boots off.\r\n\r\n'But you said I was a thief and a liar,' Kenneth said feebly, 'and it\r\nwas in the moat all the time.'\r\n\r\n'_Mother!_' it was Alison who shrieked. 'You didn't say that to him?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I didn't,' said the aunt impatiently. She thought she hadn't,\r\nbut then Kenneth thought she had.\r\n\r\n'It was _me_ took the ring,' said Alison, 'and I dropped it. I didn't\r\nsay I hadn't. I only said I'd rather not say. Oh Mother! poor Kenneth!'\r\n\r\nThe aunt, without a word, carried Kenneth up to the bath-room and turned\r\non the hot-water tap. The uncle and Ethel followed.\r\n\r\n'Why didn't you own up, you sneak?' said Conrad to his sister with\r\nwithering scorn.\r\n\r\n'Sneak,' echoed the stout George.\r\n\r\n'I meant to. I was only getting steam up,' sobbed Alison. 'I didn't\r\nknow. Mother only told us she wasn't pleased with Ken, and so he wasn't\r\nto go to the picnic. Oh! what shall I do? What shall I do?'\r\n\r\n'Sneak!' said her brothers in chorus, and left her to her tears of shame\r\nand remorse.\r\n\r\nIt was Kenneth who next day begged every one to forgive and forget. And\r\nas it was _his_ day--rather like a birthday, you know--when no one could\r\nrefuse him anything, all agreed that the whole affair should be buried\r\nin oblivion. Every one was tremendously kind, the aunt more so than any\r\none. But Alison's eyes were still red when in the afternoon they all\r\nwent fishing once more. And before Kenneth's hook had been two minutes\r\nin the water there was a bite, a very big fish, the uncle had to be\r\ncalled from his study to land it.\r\n\r\n'Here's a magnificent fellow,' said the uncle. 'Not an ounce less than\r\ntwo pounds, Ken. I'll have it stuffed for you.'\r\n\r\nAnd he held out the fish and Kenneth found himself face to face with the\r\nDoyen Carp. There was no mistaking that mouth that opened like a\r\nkit-bag, and shut in a sneer like a rhinoceros's. Its eye was most\r\nreproachful.\r\n\r\n'Oh! no,' cried Kenneth, 'you helped me back and I'll help you back,'\r\nand he caught the Carp from the hands of the uncle and flung it out in\r\nthe moat.\r\n\r\n'Your head's not quite right yet, my boy,' said the uncle kindly.\r\n'Hadn't you better go in and lie down a bit?'\r\n\r\nBut Alison understood, for he had told her the whole story. He had told\r\nher that morning before breakfast while she was still in deep disgrace;\r\nto cheer her up, he said. And, most disappointingly, it made her cry\r\nmore than ever.\r\n\r\n'Your poor little fins,' she had said, 'and having your feet tied up in\r\nyour tail. And it was all my fault.'\r\n\r\n'I liked it,' Kenneth had said with earnest politeness, 'it was a most\r\nawful lark.' And he quite meant what he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE MAGICIAN'S HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all have our weaknesses. Mine is mulberries. Yours, perhaps, motor\r\ncars. Professor Taykin's was christenings--royal christenings. He always\r\nexpected to be asked to the christening parties of all the little royal\r\nbabies, and of course he never was, because he was not a lord, or a\r\nduke, or a seller of bacon and tea, or anything really high-class, but\r\nmerely a wicked magician, who by economy and strict attention to\r\ncustomers had worked up a very good business of his own. He had not\r\nalways been wicked. He was born quite good, I believe, and his old\r\nnurse, who had long since married a farmer and retired into the calm of\r\ncountry life, always used to say that he was the duckiest little boy in\r\na plaid frock with the dearest little fat legs. But he had changed since\r\nhe was a boy, as a good many other people do--perhaps it was his trade.\r\nI dare say you've noticed that cobblers are usually thin, and brewers\r\nare generally fat, and magicians are almost always wicked.\r\n\r\nWell, his weakness (for christenings) grew stronger and stronger because\r\nit was never indulged, and at last he 'took the bull into his own\r\nhands,' as the Irish footman at the palace said, and went to a\r\nchristening without being asked. It was a very grand party given by the\r\nKing of the Fortunate Islands, and the little prince was christened\r\nFortunatus. No one took any notice of Professor Taykin. They were too\r\npolite to turn him out, but they made him wish he'd never come. He felt\r\nquite an outsider, as indeed he was, and this made him furious. So that\r\nwhen all the bright, light, laughing, fairy godmothers were crowding\r\nround the blue satin cradle, and giving gifts of beauty and strength and\r\ngoodness to the baby, the Magician suddenly did a very difficult charm\r\n(in his head, like you do mental arithmetic), and said:\r\n\r\n'Young Forty may be all that, but _I_ say he shall be the stupidest\r\nprince in the world,' and on that he vanished in a puff of red smoke\r\nwith a smell like the Fifth of November in a back garden on Streatham\r\nHill, and as he left no address the King of the Fortunate Islands\r\ncouldn't prosecute him for high treason.\r\n\r\nTaykin was very glad to think that he had made such a lot of people\r\nunhappy--the whole Court was in tears when he left, including the\r\nbaby--and he looked in the papers for another royal christening, so that\r\nhe could go to that and make a lot more people miserable. And there was\r\none fixed for the very next Wednesday. The Magician went to that, too,\r\ndisguised as a wealthy.\r\n\r\nThis time the baby was a girl. Taykin kept close to the pink velvet\r\ncradle, and when all the nice qualities in the world had been given to\r\nthe Princess he suddenly said, 'Little Aura may be all that, but _I_ say\r\nshe shall be the ugliest princess in all the world.'\r\n\r\nAnd instantly she was. It was terrible. And she had been such a\r\nbeautiful baby too. Every one had been saying that she was the most\r\nbeautiful baby they had ever seen. This sort of thing is often said at\r\nchristenings.\r\n\r\nHaving uglified the unfortunate little Princess the Magician did the\r\nspell (in his mind, just as you do your spelling) to make himself\r\nvanish, but to his horror there was no red smoke and no smell of\r\nfireworks, and there he was, still, where he now very much wished not to\r\nbe. Because one of the fairies there had seen, just one second too late\r\nto save the Princess, what he was up to, and had made a strong little\r\ncharm in a great hurry to prevent his vanishing. This Fairy was a White\r\nWitch, and of course you know that White Magic is much stronger than\r\nBlack Magic, as well as more suited for drawing-room performances. So\r\nthere the Magician stood, 'looking like a thunder-struck pig,' as some\r\none unkindly said, and the dear White Witch bent down and kissed the\r\nbaby princess.\r\n\r\n'There!' she said, 'you can keep that kiss till you want it. When the\r\ntime comes you'll know what to do with it. The Magician can't vanish,\r\nSire. You'd better arrest him.'\r\n\r\n'Arrest that person,' said the King, pointing to Taykin. 'I suppose your\r\ncharms are of a permanent nature, madam.'\r\n\r\n'Quite,' said the Fairy, 'at least they never go till there's no longer\r\nany use for them.'\r\n\r\nSo the Magician was shut up in an enormously high tower, and allowed to\r\nplay with magic; but none of his spells could act outside the tower so\r\nhe was never able to pass the extra double guard that watched outside\r\nnight and day. The King would have liked to have the Magician executed\r\nbut the White Witch warned him that this would never do.\r\n\r\n'Don't you see,' she said, 'he's the only person who can make the\r\nPrincess beautiful again. And he'll do it some day. But don't you go\r\n_asking_ him to do it. He'll never do anything to oblige you. He's that\r\nsort of man.'\r\n\r\nSo the years rolled on. The Magician stayed in the tower and did magic\r\nand was very bored,--for it is dull to take white rabbits out of your\r\nhat, and your hat out of nothing when there's no one to see you.\r\n\r\nPrince Fortunatus was such a stupid little boy that he got lost quite\r\nearly in the story, and went about the country saying his name was\r\nJames, which it wasn't. A baker's wife found him and adopted him, and\r\nsold the diamond buttons of his little overcoat, for three hundred\r\npounds, and as she was a very honest woman she put two hundred away for\r\nJames to have when he grew up.\r\n\r\nThe years rolled on. Aura continued to be hideous, and she was very\r\nunhappy, till on her twentieth birthday her married cousin Belinda came\r\nto see her. Now Belinda had been made ugly in her cradle too, so she\r\ncould sympathise as no one else could.\r\n\r\n'But _I_ got out of it all right, and so will you,' said Belinda. 'I'm\r\nsure the first thing to do is to find a magician.'\r\n\r\n'Father banished them all twenty years ago,' said Aura behind her veil,\r\n'all but the one who uglified me.'\r\n\r\n'Then I should go to _him_,' said beautiful Belinda. 'Dress up as a\r\nbeggar maid, and give him fifty pounds to do it. Not more, or he may\r\nsuspect that you're not a beggar maid. It will be great fun. I'd go with\r\nyou only I promised Bellamant faithfully that I'd be home to lunch.' And\r\noff she went in her mother-of-pearl coach, leaving Aura to look through\r\nthe bound volumes of _The Perfect Lady_ in the palace library, to find\r\nout the proper costume for a beggar maid.\r\n\r\nNow that very morning the Magician's old nurse had packed up a ham, and\r\nsome eggs, and some honey, and some apples, and a sweet bunch of\r\nold-fashioned flowers, and borrowed the baker's boy to hold the horse\r\nfor her, and started off to see the Magician. It was forty years since\r\nshe'd seen him, but she loved him still, and now she thought she could\r\ndo him a good turn. She asked in the town for his address, and learned\r\nthat he lived in the Black Tower.\r\n\r\n'But you'd best be careful,' the townsfolk said, 'he's a spiteful chap.'\r\n\r\n'Bless you,' said the old nurse, 'he won't hurt me as nursed him when he\r\nwas a babe, in a plaid frock with the dearest little fat legs ever you\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\nSo she got to the tower, and the guards let her through. Taykin was\r\nalmost pleased to see her--remember he had had no visitors for twenty\r\nyears--and he was quite pleased to see the ham and the honey.\r\n\r\n'But where did I put them _h_eggs?' said the nurse, 'and the apples--I\r\nmust have left them at home after all.'\r\n\r\nShe had. But the Magician just waved his hand in the air, and there was\r\na basket of apples that hadn't been there before. The eggs he took out\r\nof her bonnet, the folds of her shawl, and even from his own mouth, just\r\nlike a conjurer does. Only of course he was a real Magician.\r\n\r\n'Lor!' said she, 'it's like magic.'\r\n\r\n'It _is_ magic,' said he. 'That's my trade. It's quite a pleasure to\r\nhave an audience again. I've lived here alone for twenty years. It's\r\nvery lonely, especially of an evening.'\r\n\r\n'Can't you get out?' said the nurse.\r\n\r\n'No. King's orders must be respected, but it's a dog's life.' He\r\nsniffed, made himself a magic handkerchief out of empty air, and wiped\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n'Take an apprentice, my dear,' said the nurse.\r\n\r\n'And teach him my magic? Not me.'\r\n\r\n'Suppose you got one so stupid he _couldn't_ learn?'\r\n\r\n'That would be all right--but it's no use advertising for a stupid\r\nperson--you'd get no answers.'\r\n\r\n'You needn't advertise,' said the nurse; and she went out and brought in\r\nJames, who was really the Prince of the Fortunate Islands, and also the\r\nbaker's boy she had brought with her to hold the horse's head.\r\n\r\n'Now, James,' she said, 'you'd like to be apprenticed, wouldn't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the poor stupid boy.\r\n\r\n'Then give the gentleman your money, James.'\r\n\r\nJames did.\r\n\r\n'My last doubts vanish,' said the Magician, 'he _is_ stupid. Nurse, let\r\nus celebrate the occasion with a little drop of something. Not before\r\nthe boy because of setting an example. James, wash up. Not here, silly;\r\nin the back kitchen.'\r\n\r\nSo James washed up, and as he was very clumsy he happened to break a\r\nlittle bottle of essence of dreams that was on the shelf, and instantly\r\nthere floated up from the washing-up water the vision of a princess more\r\nbeautiful than the day--so beautiful that even James could not help\r\nseeing how beautiful she was, and holding out his arms to her as she\r\ncame floating through the air above the kitchen sink. But when he held\r\nout his arms she vanished. He sighed and washed up harder than ever.\r\n\r\n'I wish I wasn't so stupid,' he said, and then there was a knock at the\r\ndoor. James wiped his hands and opened. Some one stood there in very\r\npicturesque rags and tatters. 'Please,' said some one, who was of course\r\nthe Princess, 'is Professor Taykin at home?'\r\n\r\n'Walk in, please,' said James.\r\n\r\n'My snakes alive!' said Taykin, 'what a day we're having. Three\r\nvisitors in one morning. How kind of you to call. Won't you take a\r\nchair?'\r\n\r\n'I hoped,' said the veiled Princess, 'that you'd give me something else\r\nto take.'\r\n\r\n'A glass of wine,' said Taykin. 'You'll take a glass of wine?'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you,' said the beggar maid who was the Princess.\r\n\r\n'Then take ... take your veil off,' said the nurse, 'or you won't feel\r\nthe benefit of it when you go out.'\r\n\r\n'I can't,' said Aura, 'it wouldn't be safe.'\r\n\r\n'Too beautiful, eh?' said the Magician. 'Still--you're quite safe here.'\r\n\r\n'Can you do magic?' she abruptly asked.\r\n\r\n'A little,' said he ironically.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said she, 'it's like this. I'm so ugly no one can bear to look\r\nat me. And I want to go as kitchenmaid to the palace. They want a cook\r\nand a scullion and a kitchenmaid. I thought perhaps you'd give me\r\nsomething to make me pretty. I'm only a poor beggar maid.... It would be\r\na great thing to me if....'\r\n\r\n'Go along with you,' said Taykin, very cross indeed. 'I never give to\r\nbeggars.'\r\n\r\n'Here's twopence,' whispered poor James, pressing it into her hand,\r\n'it's all I've got left.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' she whispered back. 'You _are_ good.'\r\n\r\nAnd to the Magician she said:\r\n\r\n'I happen to have fifty pounds. I'll give it you for a new face.'\r\n\r\n'Done,' cried Taykin. 'Here's another stupid one!' He grabbed the money,\r\nwaved his wand, and then and there before the astonished eyes of the\r\nnurse and the apprentice the ugly beggar maid became the loveliest\r\nprincess in the world.\r\n\r\n'Lor!' said the nurse.\r\n\r\n'My dream!' cried the apprentice.\r\n\r\n'Please,' said the Princess, 'can I have a looking-glass?' The\r\napprentice ran to unhook the one that hung over the kitchen sink, and\r\nhanded it to her. 'Oh,' she said, 'how _very_ pretty I am. How can I\r\nthank you?'\r\n\r\n'Quite easily,' said the Magician, 'beggar maid as you are, I hereby\r\noffer you my hand and heart.'\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into his waistcoat and pulled out his heart. It was fat\r\nand pink, and the Princess did not like the look of it.\r\n\r\n'Thank you very much,' said she, 'but I'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n'But I insist,' said Taykin.\r\n\r\n'But really, your offer....'\r\n\r\n'Most handsome, I'm sure,' said the nurse.\r\n\r\n'My affections are engaged,' said the Princess, looking down. 'I can't\r\nmarry you.'\r\n\r\n'Am I to take this as a refusal?' asked Taykin; and the Princess said\r\nshe feared that he was.\r\n\r\n'Very well, then,' he said, 'I shall see you home, and ask your father\r\nabout it. He'll not let you refuse an offer like this. Nurse, come and\r\ntie my necktie.'\r\n\r\nSo he went out, and the nurse with him.\r\n\r\nThen the Princess told the apprentice in a very great hurry who she was.\r\n\r\n'It would never do,' she said, 'for him to see me home. He'd find out\r\nthat I was the Princess, and he'd uglify me again in no time.'\r\n\r\n'He sha'n't see you home,' said James. 'I may be stupid but I'm strong\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\n'How brave you are,' said Aura admiringly, 'but I'd rather slip away\r\nquietly, without any fuss. Can't you undo the patent lock of that door?'\r\nThe apprentice tried but he was too stupid, and the Princess was not\r\nstrong enough.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry,' said the apprentice who was a Prince. 'I can't undo the\r\ndoor, but when _he_ does I'll hold him and you can get away. I dreamed\r\nof you this morning,' he added.\r\n\r\n'I dreamed of you too,' said she, 'but you were different.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' said poor James sadly, 'the person you dreamed about wasn't\r\nstupid, and I am.'\r\n\r\n'Are you _really_?' cried the Princess. 'I _am_ so glad!'\r\n\r\n'That's rather unkind, isn't it?' said he.\r\n\r\n'No; because if _that's_ all that makes you different from the man I\r\ndreamed about I can soon make _that_ all right.'\r\n\r\nAnd with that she put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him. And at\r\nher kiss his stupidness passed away like a cloud, and he became as\r\nclever as any one need be; and besides knowing all the ordinary lessons\r\nhe would have learned if he had stayed at home in his palace, he knew\r\nwho he was, and where he was, and why, and he knew all the geography of\r\nhis father's kingdom, and the exports and imports and the condition of\r\npolitics. And he knew also that the Princess loved him.\r\n\r\nSo he caught her in his arms and kissed her, and they were very happy,\r\nand told each other over and over again what a beautiful world it was,\r\nand how wonderful it was that they should have found each other, seeing\r\nthat the world is not only beautiful but rather large.\r\n\r\n'That first one was a magic kiss, you know,' said she. 'My fairy\r\ngodmother gave it to me, and I've been keeping it all these years for\r\nyou. You must get away from here, and come to the palace. Oh, you'll\r\nmanage it--you're clever now.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said, 'I _am_ clever now. I can undo the lock for you. Go, my\r\ndear, go before he comes back.'\r\n\r\nSo the Princess went. And only just in time; for as she went out of one\r\ndoor Taykin came in at the other.\r\n\r\nHe was furious to find her gone; and I should not like to write down the\r\nthings he said to his apprentice when he found that James had been so\r\nstupid as to open the door for her. They were not polite things at all.\r\n\r\nHe tried to follow her. But the Princess had warned the guards, and he\r\ncould not get out.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' he cried, 'if only my old magic would work outside this tower. I'd\r\nsoon be even with her.'\r\n\r\nAnd then in a strange, confused, yet quite sure way, he felt that the\r\nspell that held him, the White Witch's spell, was dissolved.\r\n\r\n'To the palace!' he cried; and rushing to the cauldron that hung over\r\nthe fire he leaped into it, leaped out in the form of a red lion, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation the Prince, who was his apprentice,\r\nfollowed him, calling out the same words and leaping into the same\r\ncauldron, while the poor nurse screamed and wrung her hands. As he\r\ntouched the liquor in the cauldron he felt that he was not quite\r\nhimself. He was, in fact, a green dragon. He felt himself vanish--a most\r\nuncomfortable sensation--and reappeared, with a suddenness that took his\r\nbreath away, in his own form and at the back door of the palace.\r\n\r\nThe time had been short, but already the Magician had succeeded in\r\nobtaining an engagement as palace cook. How he did it without references\r\nI don't know. Perhaps he made the references by magic as he had made the\r\neggs, and the apples, and the handkerchief.\r\n\r\nTaykin's astonishment and annoyance at being followed by his faithful\r\napprentice were soon soothed, for he saw that a stupid scullion would be\r\nof great use. Of course he had no idea that James had been made clever\r\nby a kiss.\r\n\r\n'But how are you going to cook?' asked the apprentice. 'You don't know\r\nhow!'\r\n\r\n'I shall cook,' said Taykin, 'as I do everything else--by magic.' And he\r\ndid. I wish I had time to tell you how he turned out a hot dinner of\r\nseventeen courses from totally empty saucepans, how James looked in a\r\ncupboard for spices and found it empty, and how next moment the nurse\r\nwalked out of it. The Magician had been so long alone that he seemed to\r\nrevel in the luxury of showing off to some one, and he leaped about from\r\none cupboard to another, produced cats and cockatoos out of empty jars,\r\nand made mice and rabbits disappear and reappear till James's head was\r\nin a whirl, for all his cleverness; and the nurse, as she washed up,\r\nwept tears of pure joy at her boy's wonderful skill.\r\n\r\n'All this excitement's bad for my heart, though,' Taykin said at last,\r\nand pulling his heart out of his chest, he put it on a shelf, and as he\r\ndid so his magic note-book fell from his breast and the apprentice\r\npicked it up. Taykin did not see him do it; he was busy making the\r\nkitchen lamp fly about the room like a pigeon.\r\n\r\nIt was just then that the Princess came in, looking more lovely than\r\never in a simple little morning frock of white chiffon and diamonds.\r\n\r\n'The beggar maid,' said Taykin, 'looking like a princess! I'll marry her\r\njust the same.'\r\n\r\n'I've come to give the orders for dinner,' she said; and then she saw\r\nwho it was, and gave one little cry and stood still, trembling.\r\n\r\n'To order the dinner,' said the nurse. 'Then you're----'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Aura, 'I'm the Princess.'\r\n\r\n'You're the Princess,' said the Magician. 'Then I'll marry you all the\r\nmore. And if you say no I'll uglify you as the word leaves your lips.\r\nOh, yes--you think I've just been amusing myself over my cooking--but\r\nI've really been brewing the strongest spell in the world. Marry me--or\r\ndrink----'\r\n\r\nThe Princess shuddered at these dreadful words.\r\n\r\n'Drink, or marry me,' said the Magician. 'If you marry me you shall be\r\nbeautiful for ever.'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said the nurse, 'he's a match even for a Princess.'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell papa,' said the Princess, sobbing.\r\n\r\n'No, you won't,' said Taykin. 'Your father will never know. If you won't\r\nmarry me you shall drink this and become my scullery maid--my hideous\r\nscullery maid--and wash up for ever in the lonely tower.'\r\n\r\nHe caught her by the wrist.\r\n\r\n'Stop,' cried the apprentice, who was a Prince.\r\n\r\n'Stop? _Me?_ Nonsense! Pooh!' said the Magician.\r\n\r\n'Stop, I say!' said James, who was Fortunatus. '_I've got your heart!_'\r\nHe had--and he held it up in one hand, and in the other a cooking knife.\r\n\r\n'One step nearer that lady,' said he, 'and in goes the knife.'\r\n\r\nThe Magician positively skipped in his agony and terror.\r\n\r\n'I say, look out!' he cried. 'Be careful what you're doing. Accidents\r\nhappen so easily! Suppose your foot slipped! Then no apologies would\r\nmeet the case. That's my heart you've got there. My life's bound up in\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'I know. That's often the case with people's hearts,' said Fortunatus.\r\n'We've got you, my dear sir, on toast. My Princess, might I trouble you\r\nto call the guards.'\r\n\r\nThe Magician did not dare to resist, so the guards arrested him. The\r\nnurse, though in floods of tears, managed to serve up a very good plain\r\ndinner, and after dinner the Magician was brought before the King.\r\n\r\nNow the King, as soon as he had seen that his daughter had been made so\r\nbeautiful, had caused a large number of princes to be fetched by\r\ntelephone. He was anxious to get her married at once in case she turned\r\nugly again. So before he could do justice to the Magician he had to\r\nsettle which of the princes was to marry the Princess. He had chosen the\r\nPrince of the Diamond Mountains, a very nice steady young man with a\r\ngood income. But when he suggested the match to the Princess she\r\ndeclined it, and the Magician, who was standing at the foot of the\r\nthrone steps loaded with chains, clattered forward and said:\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty, will you spare my life if I tell you something you don't\r\nknow?'\r\n\r\nThe King, who was a very inquisitive man, said 'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then know,' said Taykin, 'that the Princess won't marry _your_ choice,\r\nbecause she's made one of her own--my apprentice.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess meant to have told her father this when she had got him\r\nalone and in a good temper. But now he was in a bad temper, and in full\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice was dragged in, and all the Princess's agonized pleadings\r\nonly got this out of the King--\r\n\r\n'All right. I won't hang him. He shall be best man at your wedding.'\r\n\r\nThen the King took his daughter's hand and set her in the middle of the\r\nhall, and set the Prince of the Diamond Mountains on her right and the\r\napprentice on her left. Then he said:\r\n\r\n'I will spare the life of this aspiring youth on your left if you'll\r\npromise never to speak to him again, and if you'll promise to marry the\r\ngentleman on your right before tea this afternoon.'\r\n\r\nThe wretched Princess looked at her lover, and his lips formed the word\r\n'Promise.'\r\n\r\nSo she said: 'I promise never to speak to the gentleman on my left and\r\nto marry the gentleman on my right before tea to-day,' and held out her\r\nhand to the Prince of the Diamond Mountains.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, the Prince of the Diamond\r\nMountains was on her left, and her hand was held by her own Prince, who\r\nstood at her right hand. And yet nobody seemed to have moved. It was the\r\npurest and most high-class magic.\r\n\r\n'Dished,' cried the King, 'absolutely dished!'\r\n\r\n'A mere trifle,' said the apprentice modestly. 'I've got Taykin's magic\r\nrecipe book, as well as his heart.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we must make the best of it, I suppose,' said the King crossly.\r\n'Bless you, my children.'\r\n\r\nHe was less cross when it was explained to him that the apprentice was\r\nreally the Prince of the Fortunate Islands, and a much better match than\r\nthe Prince of the Diamond Mountains, and he was quite in a good temper\r\nby the time the nurse threw herself in front of the throne and begged\r\nthe King to let the Magician off altogether--chiefly on the ground that\r\nwhen he was a baby he was the dearest little duck that ever was, in the\r\nprettiest plaid frock, with the loveliest fat legs.\r\n\r\nThe King, moved by these arguments, said:\r\n\r\n'I'll spare him if he'll promise to be good.'\r\n\r\n'You will, ducky, won't you?' said the nurse, crying.\r\n\r\n'No,' said the Magician, 'I won't; and what's more, I can't.'\r\n\r\nThe Princess, who was now so happy that she wanted every one else to be\r\nhappy too, begged her lover to make Taykin good 'by magic.'\r\n\r\n'Alas, my dearest Lady,' said the Prince, 'no one can be made good by\r\nmagic. I could take the badness out of him--there's an excellent recipe\r\nin this note-book--but if I did that there'd be so very little left.'\r\n\r\n'Every little helps,' said the nurse wildly.\r\n\r\nPrince Fortunatus, who was James, who was the apprentice, studied the\r\nbook for a few moments, and then said a few words in a language no one\r\npresent had ever heard before.\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the wicked Magician began to tremble and shrink.\r\n\r\n'Oh, my boy--be good! Promise you'll be good,' cried the nurse, still\r\nin tears.\r\n\r\nThe Magician seemed to be shrinking inside his clothes. He grew smaller\r\nand smaller. The nurse caught him in her arms, and still he grew less\r\nand less, till she seemed to be holding nothing but a bundle of clothes.\r\nThen with a cry of love and triumph she tore the Magician's clothes away\r\nand held up a chubby baby boy, with the very plaid frock and fat legs\r\nshe had so often and so lovingly described.\r\n\r\n'I said there wouldn't be much of him when the badness was out,' said\r\nthe Prince Fortunatus.\r\n\r\n'I will be good; oh, I will,' said the baby boy that had been the\r\nMagician.\r\n\r\n'I'll see to that,' said the nurse. And so the story ends with love and\r\na wedding, and showers of white roses.",
