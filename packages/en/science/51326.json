MENDELÉEFF\r\n\r\nTranslated from the Russian (Sixth Edition) by George Kamensky, A.R.S.M.\r\nof the Imperial Mint, St Petersburg: Member of the Russian\r\nPhysico-Chemical Society\r\n\r\nEdited by T. A. Lawson, B.Sc.

Doubtless also there are errors of statement which have\r\nescaped correction, but we believe that the present edition will be\r\nfound better in both respects than its predecessor. We have thought\r\nit our duty as translators to give as far as possible a faithful\r\nreproduction of Professor Mendeléeff's work--the sixth Russian\r\nedition--without amplifying or modifying his statements, and in this we\r\nhave the author's approval.\r\n\r\nAlthough other duties have prevented Mr. Greenaway from undertaking the\r\ncare of the present edition, he has been kind enough to give us the\r\nbenefit of his suggestions on several points. We also wish to thank the\r\nManagers of the Royal Institution for permission to reprint the lecture\r\ndelivered at the Royal Institution by Professor Mendeléeff (Appendix\r\nI.), and to the Council of the Chemical Society for permission to\r\nreprint the Faraday lecture which forms Appendix II.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we are indebted to Mr. F. Evershed, who has given us much\r\nvaluable assistance in revising the sheets for the press.\r\n\r\n                                                                G. K.\r\n                                                                T. A. L.\r\n     _August 1897_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n                                   TO\r\n\r\n                        THE SIXTH RUSSIAN EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work was written during the years 1868-1870, its object being to\r\nacquaint the student not only with the methods of observation, the\r\nexperimental facts, and the laws of chemistry, but also with the insight\r\ngiven by this science into the unchangeable substratum underlying the\r\nvarying forms of matter.\r\n\r\nIf statements of fact themselves depend upon the person who observes\r\nthem, how much more distinct is the reflection of the personality of him\r\nwho gives an account of methods and of philosophical speculations which\r\nform the essence of science! For this reason there will inevitably be\r\nmuch that is subjective in every objective exposition of science. And as\r\nan individual production is only significant in virtue of that which has\r\npreceded and that which is contemporary with it, it resembles a mirror\r\nwhich in reflecting exaggerates the size and clearness of neighbouring\r\nobjects, and causes a person near it to see reflected most plainly those\r\nobjects which are on the side to which it is directed. Although I have\r\nendeavoured to make my book a true mirror directed towards the whole\r\ndomain of chemical changes, yet involuntarily those influences near to\r\nme have been the most clearly reflected, the most brightly illuminated,\r\nand have tinted the entire work with their colouring. In this way the\r\nchief peculiarity of the book has been determined. Experimental and\r\npractical data occupy their place, but the philosophical principles of\r\nour science form the chief theme of the work. In former times sciences,\r\nlike bridges, could only be built up by supporting them on a few broad\r\nbuttresses and long girders. In addition to the exposition of the\r\nprinciples of chemistry, it has been my desire to show how science has\r\nnow been built up like a suspension bridge, supported by the united\r\nstrength of a number of slender, but firmly-fixed, chains, which\r\nindividually are of little strength, and has thus been carried over\r\ndifficulties which before appeared insuperable. In comparing the science\r\nof the past, the present, and the future, in placing the particulars\r\nof its restricted experiments side by side with its aspirations after\r\nunbounded and infinite truth, and in restraining myself from yielding to\r\na bias towards the most attractive path, I have endeavoured to incite\r\nin the reader a spirit of inquiry, which, dissatisfied with speculative\r\nreasonings alone, should subject every idea to experiment, encourage the\r\nhabit of stubborn work, and excite a search for fresh chains of evidence\r\nto complete the bridge over the bottomless unknown. History proves that\r\nit is possible by this means to avoid two equally pernicious extremes,\r\nthe Utopian--a visionary contemplation which proceeds from a current of\r\nthought only--and the stagnant realism which is content with bare facts.\r\nSciences like chemistry, which deal with ideas as well as with material\r\nsubstances, and create a possibility of immediately verifying that\r\nwhich has been or may be discovered or assumed, demonstrate at every\r\nstep that the work of the past has availed much, and that without it it\r\nwould be impossible to advance into the ocean of the unknown. They also\r\nshow the possibility of becoming acquainted with fresh portions of this\r\nunknown, and compel us, while duly respecting the teachings of history,\r\nto cast aside classical illusions, and to engage in a work which not\r\nonly gives mental satisfaction but is also practically useful to all our\r\nfellow-creatures.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Chemistry, like every other science, is at once a means and an\r\n      end. It is a means of attaining certain practical results. Thus,\r\n      by its assistance, the obtaining of matter in its various forms\r\n      is facilitated; it shows new possibilities of availing ourselves\r\n      of the forces of nature, indicates the methods of preparing\r\n      many substances, points out their properties, &c. In this sense\r\n      chemistry is closely connected with the work of the manufacturer\r\n      and the artisan, its sphere is active, and is a means of promoting\r\n      general welfare. Besides this honourable vocation, chemistry\r\n      has another. With it, as with every other elaborated science,\r\n      there are many lofty aspirations, the contemplation of which\r\n      serves to inspire its workers and adherents. This contemplation\r\n      comprises not only the principal data of the science, but also the\r\n      generally-accepted deductions, and also hypotheses which refer\r\n      to phenomena as yet but imperfectly known. In this latter sense\r\n      scientific contemplation varies much with times and persons, it\r\n      bears the stamp of creative power, and embraces the highest forms\r\n      of scientific progress. In that pure enjoyment experienced on\r\n      approaching to the ideal, in that eagerness to draw aside the\r\n      veil from the hidden truth, and even in that discord which exists\r\n      between the various workers, we ought to see the surest pledges of\r\n      further scientific progress. Science thus advances, discovering\r\n      new truths, and at the same time obtaining practical results. The\r\n      edifice of science not only requires material, but also a plan,\r\n      and necessitates the work of preparing the materials, putting them\r\n      together, working out the plans and the symmetrical proportions of\r\n      the various parts. To conceive, understand, and grasp the whole\r\n      symmetry of the scientific edifice, including its unfinished\r\n      portions, is equivalent to tasting that enjoyment only conveyed by\r\n      the highest forms of beauty and truth. Without the material, the\r\n      plan alone is but a castle in the air--a mere possibility; whilst\r\n      the material without a plan is but useless matter. All depends\r\n      on the concordance of the materials with the plan and execution,\r\n      and the general harmony thereby attained. In the work of science,\r\n      the artisan, architect, and creator are very often one and the\r\n      same individual; but sometimes, as in other walks of life, there\r\n      is a difference between them; sometimes the plan is preconceived,\r\n      sometimes it follows the preparation and accumulation of the\r\n      raw material. Free access to the edifice of science is not only\r\n      allowed to those who devised the plan, worked out the detailed\r\n      drawings, prepared the materials, or piled up the brickwork, but\r\n      also to all those who are desirous of making a close acquaintance\r\n      with the plan, and wish to avoid dwelling in the vaults or in the\r\n      garrets where the useless lumber is stored.\r\n\r\n      Knowing how contented, free, and joyful is life in the realm of\r\n      science, one fervently wishes that many would enter its portals.\r\n      On this account many pages of this treatise are unwittingly\r\n      stamped with the earnest desire that the habits of chemical\r\n      contemplation which I have endeavoured to instil into the minds\r\n      of my readers will incite them to the further study of science.\r\n      Science will then flourish in them and by them, on a fuller\r\n      acquaintance not only with that little which is enclosed within\r\n      the narrow limits of my work, but with the further learning which\r\n      they must imbibe in order to make themselves masters of our\r\n      science and partakers in its further advancement.\r\n\r\n      Those who enlist in the cause of science have no reason to fear\r\n      when they remember the urgent need for practical workers in the\r\n      spheres of agriculture, arts, and manufacture. By summoning\r\n      adherents to the work of theoretical chemistry, I am confident\r\n      that I call them to a most useful labour, to the habit of dealing\r\n      correctly with nature and its laws, and to the possibility of\r\n      becoming truly practical men. In order to become actual chemists,\r\n      it is necessary for beginners to be well and closely acquainted\r\n      with three important branches of chemistry--analytical, organic,\r\n      and theoretical. That part of chemistry which is dealt with in\r\n      this treatise is only the groundwork of the edifice. For the\r\n      learning and development of chemistry in its truest and fullest\r\n      sense, beginners ought, in the first place, to turn their\r\n      attention to the practical work of analytical chemistry; in the\r\n      second place, to practical and theoretical acquaintance with some\r\n      special chemical question, studying the original treatises of the\r\n      investigators of the subject (at first, under the direction of\r\n      experienced teachers), because in working out particular facts the\r\n      faculty of judgment and of correct criticism becomes sharpened; in\r\n      the third place, to a knowledge of current scientific questions\r\n      through the special chemical journals and papers, and by\r\n      intercourse with other chemists. The time has come to turn aside\r\n      from visionary contemplation, from platonic aspirations, and from\r\n      classical verbosity, and to enter the regions of actual labour for\r\n      the common weal, to prove that the study of science is not only\r\n      air excellent education for youth, but that it instils the virtues\r\n      of industry and veracity, and creates solid national wealth,\r\n      material and mental, which without it would be unattainable.\r\n      Science, which deals with the infinite, is itself without bounds.\r\n\r\nThus the desire to direct those thirsting for truth to the pure source\r\nof the science of the forces acting throughout nature forms the\r\nfirst and most important aim of this book. The time has arrived when\r\na knowledge of physics and chemistry forms as important a part of\r\neducation as that of the classics did two centuries ago. In those days\r\nthe nations which excelled in classical learning stood foremost, just\r\nas now the most advanced are those which are superior in the knowledge\r\nof the natural sciences, for they form the strength and characteristic\r\nof our times. In following the above and chief aim, I set myself a\r\nsecond object: to furnish a text-book for an elementary knowledge of\r\nchemistry and so satisfy a want which undoubtedly exists among students\r\nand those who have recourse to chemistry either as a source of truth or\r\nwelfare.[2] Hence, although the fundamental object of this work was to\r\nexpress and embrace the general chemical teaching of the present day\r\nfrom a personal point of view, I have nevertheless striven throughout\r\nto maintain such a level as would render the 'Principles of Chemistry'\r\naccessible to the beginner. Many aspects of this work are determined\r\nby this combination of requirements which frequently differ widely. An\r\nissue was only possible under one condition, _i.e._ not to be carried\r\naway by what appears to be a plausible theory in explaining individual\r\nfacts and to always endeavour to transmit the simple truth of a given\r\nfact, extracting it from the vast store of the literature of the\r\nsubject and from tried personal experience. In publishing a new edition\r\nof this work I have striven to add any facts of importance recently\r\ndiscovered[3] and to revise the former edition in the above spirit. With\r\nthis object I have entirely gone over this edition, and a comparison\r\nof it with the former one will show that the additions and alterations\r\nhave cost as much labour as many chapters of the work. I also wished\r\nto show in an elementary treatise on chemistry the striking advantages\r\ngained by the application of the periodic law, which I first saw in\r\nits entirety in the year 1869 when I was engaged in writing the first\r\nedition of this book, in which, indeed, the law was first enunciated.\r\nAt that time, however, this law was not established so firmly as now,\r\nwhen so many of its consequences have been verified by the researches\r\nof numerous chemists, and especially by Roscoe, Lecoq de Boisbaudran,\r\nNilson, Brauner, Thorpe, Carnelley, Laurie, Winkler, and others. The,\r\nto me, unexpectedly rapid success with which the teaching of the\r\nperiodicity of the elements has spread in our science, and perhaps also,\r\nthe perseverance with which I collected in this work, and upon a new\r\nplan, the most important data respecting the elements and their mutual\r\nrelations, explained sufficiently the fact that the former (5th, 1889)\r\nedition of my work has been translated into English[4] and German[5] and\r\nis being translated into French.[6] Deeply touched by the favourable\r\nopinions expressed by English men of science upon my book, I ascribe\r\nthem chiefly to the periodic law placed at the basis of my treatise and\r\nespecially of the second part of the book, which contains a large amount\r\nof data having a special and sometimes quite unexpected, bearing from\r\nthe point of view of this law. As the entire scheme of this work is\r\nsubordinated to the law of periodicity, which may be illustrated in a\r\ntabular form by placing the elements in series, groups, and periods, two\r\nsuch tables are given at the end of this preface.\r\n\r\n  [2] I recommend those who are commencing the study of chemistry with my\r\n      book _to first read only what is printed in the large type_,\r\n      because in that part I have endeavoured to concentrate all the\r\n      fundamental, indispensable knowledge required for that study.\r\n      In the footnotes, printed in small type (which should be read\r\n      only after the large text has been mastered), certain details\r\n      are discussed; they are either further examples, or debatable\r\n      questions on existing ideas which I thought useful to lay\r\n      before those entering into the sphere of science, or certain\r\n      historical and technical details which might be withdrawn from the\r\n      fundamental portion of the book. Without intending to attain in my\r\n      treatise to the completeness of a work of reference, I have still\r\n      endeavoured to express the principal developments of science as\r\n      they concern the chemical elements viewed in that aspect in which\r\n      they appeared to me after long continued study of the subject and\r\n      participation in the contemporary advance of knowledge.\r\n\r\n      I have also placed my personal views, suppositions, and arguments\r\n      in the footnotes, which are chiefly designed for details and\r\n      references. But I have endeavoured to avoid here, as in the\r\n      text, not only all that I consider doubtful, but also those\r\n      details which belong either to special branches of chemistry\r\n      (for instance, to analytical, organic, physical, theoretical,\r\n      physiological, agricultural, or technical chemistry), or to\r\n      different branches of natural science which are more and more\r\n      coming into closer and closer contact with chemistry. Chemistry, I\r\n      am convinced, must occupy a place among the natural sciences side\r\n      by side with mechanics; for mechanics treats of matter as a system\r\n      of ponderable points having scarcely any individuality and only\r\n      standing in a certain state of mobile equilibrium. For chemistry,\r\n      matter is an entire world of life, with an infinite variety of\r\n      individuality both in the elements and in their combinations.\r\n      In studying the general uniformity from a mechanical point of\r\n      view, I think that the highest point of knowledge of nature\r\n      cannot be attained without taking into account the individuality\r\n      of things in which chemistry is set to seek for general higher\r\n      laws. Mechanics may be likened to the science of statesmanship,\r\n      chemistry to the sciences of jurisprudence and sociology. The\r\n      general universe could not be built up without the particular\r\n      individual universe, and would be a dry abstract were it not\r\n      enlivened by the real variety of the individual world. Mechanics\r\n      forms the classical basis of natural philosophy, while chemistry,\r\n      as a comparatively new and still young science, already strives\r\n      to--and will, in the future introduce a new, living aspect into\r\n      the philosophy of nature; all the more as chemistry alone is never\r\n      at rest or anywhere dead--its vital action has universal sway, and\r\n      inevitably determines the general aspect of the universe. Just\r\n      as the microscope and telescope enlarge the scope of vision, and\r\n      discover life in seeming immobility, so chemistry, in discovering\r\n      and striving to discern the life of the invisible world of atoms\r\n      and molecules and their ultimate limit of divisibility, will\r\n      clearly introduce new and important problems into our conception\r\n      of nature. And I think that its _rôle_, which is now considerable,\r\n      will increase more and more in the future; that is, I think that\r\n      in its further development it will occupy a place side by side\r\n      with mechanics for the comprehension of the secrets of nature. But\r\n      here we require some second Newton; and I have no doubt that he\r\n      will soon appear.\r\n\r\n  [3] I was much helped in gathering data from the various chemical\r\n      journals of the last five years by the abstracts made for me by\r\n      Mr. Y. V. Kouriloff, to whom I tender my best thanks.\r\n\r\n  [4] The English translation was made by G. Kamensky, and edited by\r\n      A. J. Greenaway; published by Longmans, Green & Co.\r\n\r\n  [5] The German translation was made by L. Jawein and A. Thillot;\r\n      published by Ricker (St. Petersburg).\r\n\r\n  [6] The French translation has been commenced by E. Achkinasi and\r\n      H. Carrion from the fifth edition, and is published by Tignol\r\n      (Paris).\r\n\r\nIn this the sixth edition I have not altered any essential feature\r\nof the original work, and have retained those alterations which were\r\nintroduced into the fifth edition.[7] I have, however, added many\r\nnewly discovered facts, and in this respect it is necessary to say a\r\nfew words. Although all aspects of the simplest chemical relations are\r\nas far as possible equally developed in this book, yet on looking back\r\nI see that I have, nevertheless, given most attention to the so-called\r\nindefinite compounds examples of which may be seen in solutions. I recur\r\nrepeatedly to them, and to all the latest data respecting them, for\r\nin them I see a starting point for the future progress of our science\r\nand to them I affiliate numerous instances of definite compounds,\r\nbeginning with alloys and silicates and ending with complex acids.\r\nThere are two reasons for this. In the first place, this subject has\r\ndeeply interested me from my youth; I have devoted a portion of my\r\nown researches to it, and therefore it occupied an important position\r\neven in the first edition of my book; besides which all that has been\r\nsubsequently accomplished in our science, especially during the last\r\nfive or six years, shows that at the present day an interest in these\r\nquestions plays an important part in the minds of a large circle of\r\ncontemporary workers in chemistry. This personal attachment, if I may\r\nso call it, to the question of solutions and such indefinite compounds,\r\nmust involuntarily have impressed itself upon my work, and in the later\r\neditions I have even had to strive not to give this subject a greater\r\ndevelopment than previously, so great was the material accumulated,\r\nwhich however does not yet give us the right to consider even the most\r\nelementary questions respecting solutions as solved. Thus, we cannot\r\nyet say what a solution really is. My own view is that a solution is\r\na homogeneous liquid system of unstable dissociating compounds of\r\nthe solvent with the substance dissolved. But although such a theory\r\nexplains much to me, I cannot consider my opinion as proved, and\r\ntherefore give it with some reserve as one of several hypotheses.[8] As\r\na subject yet far from solved, I might naturally have ignored it, or\r\nonly mentioned it cursorily, but such a treatment of solutions, although\r\nusual in elementary treatises on chemistry, would not have answered my\r\nviews upon the subject of our science, and I wished that the reader\r\nmight find in my book beyond everything an expression of all that a\r\nstudy of the subject built up for me. If in solutions I see and can\r\nfrequently prove distinct evidences of the existence of those definite\r\ncompounds which form the more generalised province of chemical data, I\r\ncould not refrain from going into certain details respecting solutions;\r\notherwise, there would have remained no trace of that general idea, that\r\nin them we have only a certain instance of ordinary definite or atomic\r\ncompounds, subject to Dalton's laws. Having long had this idea, I wished\r\nto impress it upon the reader of my book, and it is this desire which\r\nforms the second of those chief reasons why I recur so frequently to\r\nsolutions in this work. At present, my ideas respecting solutions are\r\nshared by few, but I trust that by degrees the instances I give will\r\npave the way for their general recognition, and it is my hope that they\r\nmay find adherents among those of my readers who are in a position to\r\nwork out by experiment this difficult but highly interesting problem.\r\n\r\n  [7] The fifth edition was not only considerably enlarged, compared with\r\n      the preceding, but also the foundations of the periodic system\r\n      of the elements were placed far more firmly in it than in the\r\n      former editions. The subject-matter was also divided into\r\n      text and footnotes, which contained details unnecessary for a\r\n      first acquaintance with chemistry. The fifth edition sold out\r\n      sooner than I expected, so that instead of issuing supplements\r\n      (containing the latest discoveries in chemistry), as I had\r\n      proposed, I was obliged to publish the present entirely new\r\n      edition of the work.\r\n\r\n  [8] This hypothesis is not only mentioned in different parts of this\r\n      book, but is partly (from the aspect of the specific gravity of\r\n      solutions) developed in my work, _The Investigation of Solutions\r\n      from their Specific Gravity_, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I desire to record my thanks to V. D.

The primary object of chemistry is\r\nthe study of the homogeneous substances[2] of which all the objects of\r\nthe universe are made up, with the transformations of these substances\r\ninto each other, and with the phenomena[3] which accompany such\r\ntransformations. Every chemical change or reaction,[4] as it is called,\r\ncan only take place under a condition of most intimate and close contact\r\nof the re-acting substances,[5] and is determined by the forces proper\r\nto the smallest invisible particles (molecules) of matter. We must\r\ndistinguish three chief classes of chemical transformations.\r\n\r\n  [1] The investigation of a substance or a natural phenomenon consists\r\n      (_a_) in determining the relation of the object under examination\r\n      to that which is already known, either from previous researches,\r\n      or from experiment, or from the knowledge of the common\r\n      surroundings of life--that is, in determining and expressing the\r\n      quality of the unknown by the aid of that which is known; (_b_)\r\n      in measuring all that which can be subjected to measurement,\r\n      and thereby denoting the quantitative relation of that under\r\n      investigation to that already known and its relation to the\r\n      categories of time, space, temperature, mass, &c.; (_c_) in\r\n      determining the position held by the object under investigation\r\n      in the system of known objects guided by both qualitative and\r\n      quantitative data; (_d_) in determining, from the quantities which\r\n      have been measured, the empirical (visible) dependence (function,\r\n      or 'law,' as it is sometimes termed) of variable factors--for\r\n      instance, the dependence of the composition of the substance on\r\n      its properties, of temperature on time, of time on locality, &c.;\r\n      (_e_) in framing hypotheses or propositions as to the actual cause\r\n      and true nature of the relation between that studied (measured\r\n      or observed) and that which is known or the categories of time,\r\n      space, &c.; (_f_) in verifying the logical consequences of the\r\n      hypotheses by experiment; and (_g_) in advancing a theory which\r\n      shall account for the nature of the properties of that studied in\r\n      its relations with things already known and with those conditions\r\n      or categories among which it exists. It is certain that it is\r\n      only possible to carry out these investigations when we have\r\n      taken as a basis some incontestable fact which is self-evident\r\n      to our understanding; as, for instance, number, time, space,\r\n      motion, or mass. The determination of such primary or fundamental\r\n      conceptions, although not excluded from the possibility of\r\n      investigation, frequently does not subject itself to our present\r\n      mode of scientific generalisation. Hence it follows that in the\r\n      investigation of anything, there always remains something which is\r\n      accepted without investigation, or admitted as a known factor. The\r\n      axioms of geometry may be taken as an example. Thus in the science\r\n      of biology it is necessary to admit the faculty of organisms for\r\n      multiplying themselves, as a conception whose meaning is as yet\r\n      unknown. In the study of chemistry, too, the notion of elements\r\n      must be accepted almost without any further analysis. However, by\r\n      first investigating that which is visible and subject to direct\r\n      observation by the organs of the senses, we may hope that in\r\n      the first place hypotheses will be arrived at, and afterwards\r\n      theories of that which has now to be placed at the basis of our\r\n      investigations. The minds of the ancients strove to seize at once\r\n      the very fundamental categories of investigation, whilst all the\r\n      successes of recent knowledge are based on the above-cited method\r\n      of investigation without the determination of 'the beginning of\r\n      all beginnings.' By following this inductive method, the _exact\r\n      sciences_ have already succeeded in becoming accurately acquainted\r\n      with much of the invisible world, which directly is imperceptible\r\n      to the organs of sense (for example, the molecular motion of all\r\n      bodies, the composition of the heavenly luminaries, the paths\r\n      of their motion, the necessity for the existence of substances\r\n      which cannot be subjected to experiment, &c.), and have verified\r\n      the knowledge thus obtained, and employed it for increasing the\r\n      interests of humanity. It may therefore be safely said that _the\r\n      inductive method of investigation_ is a more perfect mode of\r\n      acquiring knowledge than the deductive method alone (starting from\r\n      a little of the unknown accepted as incontestable to arrive at the\r\n      much which is visible and observable) by which the ancients strove\r\n      to embrace the universe. By investigating the universe by an\r\n      inductive method (endeavouring from the much which is observable\r\n      to arrive at a little which may be verified and is indubitable)\r\n      the new science refuses to recognise dogma as truth, but through\r\n      _reason_, by a slow and laborious method of investigation, strives\r\n      for and attains to true deductions.\r\n\r\n  [2] A substance or material is that which occupies space and has\r\n      weight; that is, which presents a mass attracted by the earth and\r\n      by other masses of material, and of which the _objects_ of nature\r\n      are composed, and by means of which the motions and _phenomena_\r\n      of nature are accomplished. It is easy to discover by examining\r\n      and investigating, by various methods, the objects met with\r\n      in nature and in the arts, that some of them are homogeneous,\r\n      whilst others are composed of a mixture of several homogeneous\r\n      substances. This is most clearly apparent in solid substances.\r\n      The metals used in the arts (for example, gold, iron, copper)\r\n      must be homogeneous, otherwise they are brittle and unfit for\r\n      many purposes. Homogeneous matter exhibits similar properties in\r\n      all its parts. By breaking up a homogeneous substance we obtain\r\n      parts which, although different in form, resemble each other in\r\n      their properties. Glass, pure sugar, marble, &c., are examples of\r\n      homogeneous substances. Examples of non-homogeneous substances\r\n      are, however, much more frequent in nature and the arts. Thus\r\n      the majority of the rocks are not homogeneous. In porphyries\r\n      bright pieces of a mineral called 'orthoclase' are often seen\r\n      interspersed amongst the dark mass of the rock. In ordinary red\r\n      granite it is easy to distinguish large pieces of orthoclase mixed\r\n      with dark semi-transparent quartz and flexible laminæ of mica.\r\n      Similarly, plants and animals are non-homogeneous. Thus, leaves\r\n      are composed of a skin, fibre, pulp, sap, and a green colouring\r\n      matter. As an example of those non-homogeneous substances which\r\n      are produced artificially, gunpowder may be cited, which is\r\n      prepared by mixing together known proportions of sulphur, nitre,\r\n      and charcoal. Many liquids, also, are not homogeneous, as may be\r\n      observed by the aid of the microscope, when drops of blood are\r\n      seen to consist of a colourless liquid in which red corpuscles,\r\n      invisible to the naked eye owing to their small size, are floating\r\n      about. It is these corpuscles which give blood its peculiar\r\n      colour. Milk is also a transparent liquid, in which microscopical\r\n      drops of fat are floating, which rise to the top when milk is\r\n      left at rest, forming cream. It is possible to extract from every\r\n      non-homogeneous substance those homogeneous substances of which\r\n      it is made up. Thus orthoclase may he separated from porphyry by\r\n      breaking it off. So also gold is extracted from auriferous sand by\r\n      washing away the mixture of clay and sand. Chemistry deals only\r\n      with the homogeneous substances met with in nature, or extracted\r\n      from natural or artificial non-homogeneous substances. The various\r\n      mixtures found in nature form the subjects of other natural\r\n      sciences--as geognosy, botany, zoology, anatomy, &c.\r\n\r\n  [3] All those events which are accomplished by substances in time are\r\n      termed 'phenomena.' Phenomena in themselves form the fundamental\r\n      subject of the study of physics. Motion is the primary and\r\n      most generally understood form of phenomenon, and therefore we\r\n      endeavour to reason about other phenomena as clearly as when\r\n      dealing with motion. For this reason mechanics, which treats of\r\n      motion, forms the fundamental science of natural philosophy, and\r\n      all other sciences endeavour to reduce the phenomena with which\r\n      they are concerned to mechanical principles. Astronomy was the\r\n      first to take to this path of reasoning, and succeeded in many\r\n      cases in reducing astronomical to purely mechanical phenomena.\r\n      Chemistry and physics, physiology and biology are proceeding in\r\n      the same direction. One of the most important questions of all\r\n      natural science, and one which has been handed down from the\r\n      philosophers of classic times, is, whether the comprehension of\r\n      all that is visible can be reduced to motion? Its participation\r\n      in all, from the 'fixed' stars to the most minute parts of the\r\n      coldest bodies (Dewar, in 1894 showed that many substances cooled\r\n      to -180° fluoresce more strongly than at the ordinary temperature;\r\n      _i.e._ that there is a motion in them which produces light) must\r\n      now be recognised as undoubtable from direct experiment and\r\n      observation, but it does not follow from this that by motion alone\r\n      can all be explained. This follows, however, from the fact that\r\n      we cannot apprehend motion otherwise than by recognising matter\r\n      in a state of motion. If light and electricity be understood as\r\n      particular forms of motion, then we must inevitably recognise\r\n      the existence of a peculiar luminiferous (universal) ether as\r\n      a material, transmitting this form of motion. And so, under\r\n      the present state of knowledge, it is inevitably necessary to\r\n      recognise the particular categories, motion and matter, and as\r\n      chemistry is more closely concerned with the various forms of the\r\n      latter, it should, together with mechanics or the study of motion,\r\n      lie at the basis of natural science.\r\n\r\n  [4] The verb 'to react' means to act or change chemically.\r\n\r\n  [5] If a phenomenon proceeds at visible or measurable distances (as,\r\n      for instance, magnetic attraction or gravity), it cannot be\r\n      described as chemical, since these phenomena only take place at\r\n      distances immeasurably small and undistinguishable to the eye or\r\n      the microscope; that is to say, they are purely molecular.\r\n\r\n1. _Combination_ is a reaction in which the union of two substances\r\nyields a new one, or in general terms, from a given number of\r\nsubstances, a lesser number is obtained. Thus, by heating a mixture of\r\niron and sulphur[6] a single new substance is produced, iron sulphide,\r\nin which the constituent substances cannot be distinguished even by\r\nthe highest magnifying power. Before the reaction, the iron could be\r\nseparated from the mixture by a magnet, and the sulphur by dissolving it\r\nin certain oily liquids;[7] in general, before combination they might\r\nbe mechanically separated from each other, but after combination both\r\nsubstances penetrate into each other, and are then neither mechanically\r\nseparable nor individually distinguishable. As a rule, reactions of\r\ndirect combination are accompanied by an evolution of heat, and the\r\ncommon case of combustion, evolving heat, consists in the combination\r\nof combustible substances with a portion (oxygen) of the atmosphere,\r\nthe gases and vapours contained in the smoke being the products of\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n2. Reactions of _decomposition_ are cases the reverse of those of\r\ncombination, that is, in which one substance gives two--or, in general,\r\na given number of substances a greater number. Thus, by heating wood\r\n(and also coal and many animal or vegetable substances) without access\r\nto air, a combustible gas, a watery liquid, tar, and carbon are\r\nobtained. It is in this way that tar, illuminating gas, and charcoal are\r\nprepared on a large scale.[8] All limestones, for example, flagstones,\r\nchalk, or marble, are decomposed by heating to redness into lime and a\r\npeculiar gas called carbonic anhydride. A similar decomposition, taking\r\nplace, however, at a much lower temperature, proceeds with the green\r\ncopper carbonate which is contained in natural malachite. This example\r\nwill be studied more in detail presently. Whilst heat is evolved in the\r\nordinary reactions of combination, it is, on the contrary, absorbed in\r\nthe reactions of decomposition.\r\n\r\n3. The third class of chemical reactions--where the number of re-acting\r\nsubstances is equal to the number of substances formed--may be\r\nconsidered as a simultaneous decomposition and combination. If, for\r\ninstance, two compounds A and B are taken and they react on each other\r\nto form the substances C and D, then supposing that A is decomposed\r\ninto D and E, and that E combines with B to form C, we have a reaction\r\nin which two substances A, or D E, and B were taken and two others\r\nC, or E B, and D were produced. Such reactions ought to be placed\r\nunder the general term of reactions of '_rearrangement_,' and the\r\nparticular case where two substances give two fresh ones, reactions of\r\n'_substitution_.'[9] Thus, if a piece of iron be immersed in a solution\r\nof blue vitriol (copper sulphate), copper is formed--or, rather,\r\nseparated out, and green vitriol (iron sulphate, which only differs\r\nfrom the blue vitriol in that the iron has replaced the copper) is\r\nobtained in solution. In this manner iron may be coated with copper, so\r\nalso copper with silver; such reactions are frequently made use of in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n  [6] For this purpose a piece of iron may be made red hot in a forge,\r\n      and then placed in contact with a lump of sulphur, when iron\r\n      sulphide will be obtained as a molten liquid, the combination\r\n      being accompanied by a visible increase in the glow of the iron.\r\n      Or else iron filings are mixed with powdered sulphur in the\r\n      proportion of 5 parts of iron to 3 parts of sulphur, and the\r\n      mixture placed in a glass tube, which is then heated in one place.\r\n      Combination does not commence without the aid of external heat,\r\n      but when once started in any portion of the mixture it extends\r\n      throughout the entire mass, because the portion first heated\r\n      evolves sufficient heat in forming iron sulphide to raise the\r\n      adjacent parts of the mixture to the temperature required for\r\n      starting the reaction. The rise in temperature thus produced is so\r\n      high as to soften the glass tube.\r\n\r\n  [7] Sulphur is slightly soluble in many thin oils; it is very soluble\r\n      in carbon bisulphide and in some other liquids. Iron is insoluble\r\n      in carbon bisulphide, and the sulphur therefore can be dissolved\r\n      away from the iron.\r\n\r\n  [8] Decomposition of this kind is termed 'dry distillation,' because,\r\n      as in distillation, the substance is heated and vapours are\r\n      given off which, on cooling, condense into liquids. In general,\r\n      decomposition, in absorbing heat, presents much in common to a\r\n      physical change of state--such as, for example, that of a liquid\r\n      into a gas. Deville likened complete decomposition to boiling, and\r\n      compared partial decomposition, when a portion of a substance is\r\n      not decomposed in the presence of its products of decomposition\r\n      (or dissociation), to evaporation.\r\n\r\n  [9] A reaction of rearrangement may in certain cases take place with\r\n      one substance only; that is to say, a substance may by itself\r\n      change into a new isomeric form. Thus, for example, if hard yellow\r\n      sulphur be heated to a temperature of 250° and then poured into\r\n      cold water it gives, on cooling, a soft, brown variety. Ordinary\r\n      phosphorus, which is transparent, poisonous, and phosphorescent\r\n      in the dark (in the air), gives, after being heated at 270° (in\r\n      an atmosphere incapable of supporting combustion, such as steam),\r\n      an opaque, red, and non-poisonous isomeric variety, which is not\r\n      phosphorescent. Cases of isomerism point out the possibility of an\r\n      internal rearrangement in a substance, and are the result of an\r\n      alteration in the grouping of the same elements, just as a certain\r\n      number of balls may be grouped in figures and forms of different\r\n      shapes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the chemical changes which occur in nature and\r\nare made use of technically are very complicated, as they consist\r\nof an association of many separate and simultaneous combinations,\r\ndecompositions, and replacements. It is chiefly due to this natural\r\ncomplexity of chemical phenomena that for so many centuries chemistry\r\ndid not exist as an exact science; that is so say, that although many\r\nchemical changes were known and made use of,[10] yet their real nature\r\nwas unknown, nor could they be predicted or directed at will. Another\r\nreason for the tardy progress of chemical knowledge is the participation\r\nof gaseous substances, especially air, in many reactions. The true\r\ncomprehension of air as a ponderable substance, and of gases in general\r\nas peculiar elastic and dispersive states of matter, was only arrived\r\nat in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and it was only after\r\nthis that the transformations of substances could form a science. Up\r\nto that time, without understanding the invisible and yet ponderable\r\ngaseous and vaporous states of substances, it was impossible to obtain\r\nany fundamental chemical evidence, because gases escaped from notice\r\nbetween the reacting and resultant substances. It is easy from the\r\nimpression conveyed to us by the phenomena we observe to form the\r\nopinion that matter is created and destroyed: a whole mass of trees\r\nburn, and there only remains a little charcoal and ash, whilst from\r\none small seed there grows little by little a majestic tree. In one\r\ncase matter seems to be destroyed, and in the other to be created. This\r\nconclusion is arrived at because the formation or consumption of gases,\r\nbeing under the circumstances invisible to the eye, is not observed.\r\nWhen wood burns it undergoes a chemical change into gaseous products,\r\nwhich escape as smoke. A very simple experiment will prove this. By\r\ncollecting the smoke it may be observed that it contains gases which\r\ndiffer entirely from air, being incapable of supporting combustion or\r\nrespiration. These gases may be weighed, and it will then be seen that\r\ntheir weight exceeds that of the wood taken. This increase in weight\r\narises from the fact that, in burning, the component parts of the wood\r\ncombine with a portion of the air; in like manner iron increases in\r\nweight by rusting. In burning gunpowder its substance is not destroyed,\r\nbut only converted into gases and smoke. So also in the growth of a\r\ntree; the seed does not increase in mass of itself and from itself, but\r\ngrows because it absorbs gases from the atmosphere and sucks water and\r\nsubstances dissolved therein from the earth through its roots. The sap\r\nand solid substances which give plants their form are produced from\r\nthese absorbed gases and liquids by complicated chemical processes. The\r\ngases and liquids are converted into solid substances by the plants\r\nthemselves. Plants not only do not increase in size, but die, in a gas\r\nwhich does not contain the constituents of air. When moist substances\r\ndry they decrease in weight; when water evaporates we know that it\r\ndoes not disappear, but will return from the atmosphere as rain, dew,\r\nand snow. When water is absorbed by the earth, it does not disappear\r\nthere for ever, but accumulates somewhere underground, from whence it\r\nafterwards flows forth as a spring. Thus matter does not disappear\r\nand is not created, but only undergoes various physical and chemical\r\ntransformations--that is to say, changes its locality and form. Matter\r\nremains on the earth in the same quantity as before; in a word it is, so\r\nfar as we are concerned, everlasting. It was difficult to submit this\r\nsimple and primary truth of chemistry to investigation, but when once\r\nmade clear it rapidly spread, and now seems as natural and simple as\r\nmany truths which have been acknowledged for ages. Mariotte and other\r\nsavants of the seventeenth century already suspected the existence of\r\nthe law of the indestructibility of matter, but they made no efforts\r\nto express it or to apply it to the requirements of science. The\r\nexperiments by means of which this simple law was arrived at were\r\nmade during the latter half of the last century by the founder of\r\nmodern chemistry, LAVOISIER, the French Academician and tax farmer. The\r\nnumerous experiments of this savant were conducted with the aid of the\r\nbalance, which is the only means of directly and accurately determining\r\nthe quantity of matter.\r\n\r\n  [10] Thus the ancients knew how to convert the juice of grapes\r\n       containing the saccharine principle (glucose) into wine or\r\n       vinegar, how to extract metals from the ores which are found\r\n       in the earth's crust, and how to prepare glass from earthy\r\n       substances.\r\n\r\nLavoisier found, by weighing all the substances, and even the apparatus,\r\nused in every experiment, and then weighing the substances obtained\r\nafter the chemical change, that the sum of the weights of the substances\r\nformed was always equal to the sum of the weights of the substances\r\ntaken; or, in other words: MATTER IS NOT CREATED AND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR,\r\nor that, _matter is everlasting_. This expression naturally includes\r\na hypothesis, but our only aim in using it is to concisely express\r\nthe following lengthy period--That in all experiments, and in all the\r\ninvestigated phenomena of nature, it has never been observed that the\r\nweight of the substances formed was less or greater (as far as accuracy\r\nof weighing permits[11]) than the weight of the substances originally\r\ntaken, and as weight is proportional to mass[11 bis] or quantity of\r\nmatter, it follows that no one has ever succeeded in observing a\r\ndisappearance of matter or its appearance in fresh quantities. The law\r\nof the indestructibility of matter endows all chemical investigations\r\nwith exactitude, as, on its basis, an equation may be formed for every\r\nchemical reaction. If in any reaction the weights of the substances\r\ntaken be designated by the letters A, B, C, &c., and the weights of the\r\nsubstances formed by the letters M, N, O, &c., then\r\n\r\n            A + B + C + ... ... ... = M + N + O + ... ... ...\r\n\r\nTherefore, should the weight of one of the re-acting or resultant\r\nsubstances be unknown, it may be determined by solving the equation.\r\nThe chemist, in applying the law of the indestructibility of matter,\r\nand in making use of the chemical balance, must never lose sight of any\r\none of the re-acting or resultant substances. Should such an over-sight\r\nbe made, it will at once be remarked that the sum of the weights of the\r\nsubstances taken is unequal to the sum of the weights of the substances\r\nformed. All the progress made by chemistry during the end of the last,\r\nand in the present, century is entirely and immovably founded on the\r\nlaw of the indestructibility of matter. It is absolutely necessary in\r\nbeginning the study of chemistry to become familiar with the simple\r\ntruth which is expressed by this law, and for this purpose several\r\nexamples elucidating its application will now be cited.\r\n\r\n  [11] The experiments conducted by Staas (described in detail in Chap.\r\n       XXIV. on Silver) form some of the accurate researches, proving\r\n       that the weight of matter is not altered in chemical reactions,\r\n       because he accurately weighed (introducing all the necessary\r\n       corrections) the reacting and resultant substances. Landolt\r\n       (1893) carried on various reactions in inverted and sealed glass\r\n       U-tubes, and on weighing the tubes before reaction (when the\r\n       reacting solutions were separated in each of the branches of\r\n       the tubes), and after (when the solutions had been well mixed\r\n       together by shaking), found that either the weight remained\r\n       perfectly constant or that the variation was so small (for\r\n       instance, 0·2 milligram in a total weight of about a million\r\n       milligrams) as to be ascribed to the inevitable errors of\r\n       weighing.\r\n\r\n  [11 bis] The idea of the mass of matter was first shaped into an exact\r\n       form by Galileo (died 1642), and more especially by Newton (born\r\n       1643, died 1727), in the glorious epoch of the development of\r\n       the principles of inductive reasoning enunciated by Bacon and\r\n       Descartes in their philosophical treatises. Shortly after the\r\n       death of Newton, Lavoisier, whose fame in natural philosophy\r\n       should rank with that of Galileo and Newton, was born on August\r\n       26, 1743. The death of Lavoisier occurred during the Reign\r\n       of Terror of the French Revolution, when he, together with\r\n       twenty-six other chief farmers of the revenue, was guillotined\r\n       on May 8, 1794, at Paris; but his works and ideas have made him\r\n       immortal.\r\n\r\n1. It is well known that iron rusts in damp air,[12] and that when\r\nheated to redness in air it becomes coated with scoria (oxide), having,\r\nlike rust, the appearance of an earthy substance resembling some of the\r\niron ores from which metallic iron is extracted. If the iron is weighed\r\nbefore and after the formation of the scoria or rust, it will be found\r\nthat the metal has increased in weight during the operation.[13] It\r\ncan easily be proved that this increase in weight is accomplished at\r\nthe expense of the atmosphere, and mainly, as Lavoisier proved, at the\r\nexpense of that portion which is called oxygen. In fact, in a vacuum,\r\nor in gases which do not contain oxygen, for instance, in hydrogen or\r\nnitrogen, the iron neither rusts nor becomes coated with scoria. Had the\r\niron not been weighed, the participation of the oxygen of the atmosphere\r\nin its transformation into an earthy substance might have easily passed\r\nunnoticed, as was formerly the case, when phenomena like the above were,\r\nfor this reason, misunderstood. It is evident from the law of the\r\nindestructibility of matter that as the iron increases in weight in its\r\nconversion into rust, the latter must be a more complex substance than\r\nthe iron itself, and its formation is due to a reaction of combination.\r\nWe might form an entirely wrong opinion about it, and might, for\r\ninstance, consider rust to be a simpler substance than iron, and explain\r\nthe formation of rust as the removal of something from the iron. Such,\r\nindeed, was the general opinion prior to Lavoisier, when it was held\r\nthat iron contained a certain unknown substance called 'phlogiston,' and\r\nthat rust was iron deprived of this supposed substance.\r\n\r\n  [12] By covering iron with an enamel, or varnish, or with unrustable\r\n       metals (such as nickel), or a coating of paraffin, or other\r\n       similar substances, it is protected from the air and moisture,\r\n       and so kept from rusting.\r\n\r\n  [13] Such an experiment may easily be made by taking the finest\r\n       (unrusted) iron filings (ordinary filings must be first washed\r\n       in ether, dried, and passed through a very fine sieve). The\r\n       filings thus obtained are capable of burning directly in air\r\n       (by oxidising or forming rust), especially when they hang (are\r\n       attracted) on a magnet. A compact piece of iron does not burn in\r\n       air, but spongy iron glows and smoulders like tinder. In making\r\n       the experiment, a horse-shoe magnet is fixed, with the poles\r\n       downwards, on one arm of a rather sensitive balance, and the iron\r\n       filings are applied to the magnet (on a sheet of paper) so as to\r\n       form a beard about the poles. The balance pan should be exactly\r\n       under the filings on the magnet, in order that any which might\r\n       fall from it should not alter the weight. The filings, having\r\n       been weighed, are set light to by applying the flame of a candle;\r\n       they easily take fire, and go on burning by themselves, forming\r\n       rust. When the combustion is ended, it will be clear that the\r\n       iron has increased in weight; from 5-1/2 parts by weight of iron\r\n       filings taken, there are obtained, by complete combustion, 7-1/2\r\n       parts by weight of rust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Apparatus for the decomposition of red mercury\r\noxide.]\r\n\r\n2. Copper carbonate (in the form of a powder, or as the well-known green\r\nmineral called 'malachite,' which is used for making ornaments, or as an\r\nore for the extraction of copper) changes into a black substance called\r\n'copper oxide' when heated to redness.[14] This black substance is also\r\nobtained by heating copper to redness in air--that is, it is the scoria\r\nor oxidation product of copper. The weight of the black oxide of copper\r\nleft is less than that of the copper carbonate originally taken, and\r\ntherefore we consider the reaction which occurred to have been one of\r\ndecomposition, and that by it something was separated from the green\r\ncopper carbonate, and, in fact, by closing the orifice of the vessel in\r\nwhich the copper carbonate is heated with a well-fitting cork, through\r\nwhich a gas delivery tube[15] passes whose end is immersed under water,\r\nit will be observed that on heating, a gas is formed which bubbles\r\nthrough the water. This gas can be easily collected, as will presently\r\nbe described, and it will be found to essentially differ from air in\r\nmany respects; for instance, a burning taper is extinguished in it as if\r\nit had been plunged into water. If weighing had not proved to us that\r\nsome substance had been separated, the formation of the gas might easily\r\nhave escaped our notice, for it is colourless and transparent like air,\r\nand is therefore evolved without any striking feature. The carbonic\r\nanhydride evolved may be weighed,[16] and it will be seen that the sum\r\nof the weights of the black copper oxide and carbonic anhydride is equal\r\nto the weight of the copper carbonate[17] originally taken, and thus by\r\ncarefully following out the various stages of all chemical reactions we\r\narrive at a confirmation of the law of the indestructibility of matter.\r\n\r\n  [14] For the purpose of experiment, it is most convenient to take\r\n       copper carbonate, which may be prepared by the experimenter\r\n       himself, by adding a solution of sodium carbonate to a solution\r\n       of copper sulphate. The precipitate (deposit) so formed is\r\n       collected on a filter, washed, and dried. The decomposition of\r\n       copper carbonate into copper oxide is effected by so moderate\r\n       a heat that it may be performed in a glass vessel heated by a\r\n       lamp. For this purpose a thin glass tube, closed at one end, and\r\n       called a 'test tube,' may be employed, or else a vessel called a\r\n       'retort.' The experiment is carried on, as described in example\r\n       three on p. 11, by collecting the carbonic anhydride over water,\r\n       as will be afterwards explained.\r\n\r\n  [15] Gas delivery tubes are usually made of glass tubing of various\r\n       diameters and thicknesses. If of small diameter and thickness, a\r\n       glass tube is easily bent by heating in a gas jet or the flame\r\n       of a spirit lamp, and it may also be easily divided at a given\r\n       point by making a deep scratch with a file and then breaking the\r\n       tube at this point with a sharp jerk. These properties, together\r\n       with their impermeability, transparency, hardness, and regularity\r\n       of bore, render glass tubes most useful in experiments with\r\n       gases. Naturally they might be replaced by straws, india-rubber,\r\n       metallic, or other tubes, but these are more difficult to fix on\r\n       to a vessel, and are not entirely impervious to gases. A glass\r\n       gas delivery tube may be hermetically fixed into a vessel by\r\n       fitting it into a perforated cork, which should be soft and free\r\n       from flaws, and fixing the cork into the orifice of the vessel.\r\n       To protect the cork from the action of gases it is sometimes\r\n       previously soaked in paraffin, or it may be replaced by an\r\n       india-rubber cork.\r\n\r\n  [16] Gases, like all other substances, may be weighed, but, owing to\r\n       their extreme lightness and the difficulty of dealing with them\r\n       in large masses, they can only be weighed by very sensitive\r\n       balances; that is, in such as, with a considerable load, indicate\r\n       a very small difference in weight--for example, a centigram or a\r\n       milligram with a load of 1,000 grams. In order to weigh a gas,\r\n       a glass globe furnished with a tight-fitting stop-cock is first\r\n       of all exhausted of air by an air-pump (a Sprengel pump is the\r\n       best). The stop-cock is then closed, and the exhausted globe\r\n       weighed. If the gas to be weighed is then let into the globe,\r\n       its weight can be determined from the increase in the weight of\r\n       the globe. It is necessary, however, that the temperature and\r\n       pressure of the air about the balance should remain constant for\r\n       both weighings, as the weight of the globe in air will (according\r\n       to the laws of hydrostatics) vary with its density. The volume of\r\n       the air displaced, and its weight, must therefore be determined\r\n       by observing the temperature, density, and moisture of the\r\n       atmosphere during the time of experiment. This will be partly\r\n       explained later, but may be studied more in detail by physics.\r\n       Owing to the complexity of all these operations, the mass of a\r\n       gas is usually determined from its volume and density, or from\r\n       the weight of a known volume.\r\n\r\n  [17] The copper carbonate should be dried before weighing, as\r\n       otherwise--besides copper oxide and carbonic anhydride--water\r\n       will be obtained in the decomposition. Water forms a part of the\r\n       composition of malachite, and has therefore to be taken into\r\n       consideration. The water produced in the decomposition may be all\r\n       collected by absorbing it in sulphuric acid or calcium chloride,\r\n       as will be described further on. In order to dry a salt it must\r\n       be heated at about 100° until its weight remains constant, or\r\n       be placed under an air pump over sulphuric acid, as will also\r\n       be presently described. As water is met with almost everywhere,\r\n       and as it is absorbed by many substances, the possibility of its\r\n       presence should never be lost sight of.\r\n\r\n3. Red mercury oxide (which is formed as mercury rust by heating\r\nmercury in air) is decomposed like copper carbonate (only by heating\r\nmore slowly and at a somewhat higher temperature), with the formation\r\nof the peculiar gas, oxygen. For this purpose the mercury oxide is\r\nplaced in a glass tube or retort,[18] to which a gas delivery tube is\r\nattached by means of a cork. This tube is bent downwards, as shown in\r\nthe drawing (Fig. 1). The open end of the gas delivery tube is immersed\r\nin a vessel filled with water, called a pneumatic trough.[19] When the\r\ngas begins to be evolved in the retort it is obliged, having no other\r\noutlet, to escape through the gas delivery tube into the water in the\r\npneumatic trough, and therefore its evolution will be rendered visible\r\nby the bubbles coming from this tube. In heating the retort containing\r\nthe mercury oxide, the air contained in the apparatus is first partly\r\nexpelled, owing to its expansion by heat, and then the peculiar gas\r\ncalled 'oxygen' is evolved, and may be easily collected as it comes off.\r\nFor this purpose a vessel (an ordinary cylinder, as in the drawing) is\r\nfilled quite full with water and its mouth closed; it is then inverted\r\nand placed in this position under the water in the trough; the mouth\r\nis then opened. The cylinder will remain full of water--that is, the\r\nwater will remain at a higher level in it than in the surrounding\r\nvessel, owing to the atmospheric pressure. The atmosphere presses on\r\nthe surface of the water in the trough, and prevents the water from\r\nflowing out of the cylinder. The mouth of the cylinder is placed over\r\nthe end of the gas delivery tube,[20] and the bubbles issuing from it\r\nwill rise into the cylinder and displace the water contained in it.\r\nGases are generally collected in this manner. When a sufficient quantity\r\nof gas has accumulated in the cylinder it can be clearly shown that it\r\nis not air, but another gas which is distinguished by its capacity for\r\nvigorously supporting combustion. In order to show this, the cylinder is\r\nclosed, under water, and removed from the bath; its mouth is then turned\r\nupwards, and a smouldering taper plunged into it. As is well known, a\r\nsmouldering taper will be extinguished in air, but in the gas which\r\nis given off from red mercury oxide it burns clearly and vigorously,\r\nshowing the property possessed by this gas for supporting combustion\r\nmore energetically than air, and thus enabling it to be distinguished\r\nfrom the latter. It may be observed in this experiment that, besides the\r\nformation of oxygen, metallic mercury is formed, which, volatilising at\r\nthe high temperature required for the reaction, condenses on the cooler\r\nparts of the retort as a mirror or in globules. Thus two substances,\r\nmercury and oxygen, are obtained by heating red mercury oxide. In this\r\nreaction, from one substance, two new substances are produced--that\r\nis, a decomposition has taken place. The means of collecting and\r\ninvestigating gases were known before Lavoisier's time, but he first\r\nshowed the real part they played in the processes of many chemical\r\nchanges which before his era were either wrongly understood (as will be\r\nafterwards explained) or were not explained at all, but only observed\r\nin their superficial aspects. This experiment on red mercury oxide has\r\na special significance in the history of chemistry contemporary with\r\nLavoisier, because the oxygen gas which is here evolved is contained in\r\nthe atmosphere, and plays a most important part in nature, especially in\r\nthe respiration of animals, in combustion in air, and in the formation\r\nof rusts or scoriæ (earths, as they were then called) from metals--that\r\nis, of earthy substances, like the ores from which metals are extracted.\r\n\r\n  [18] As the decomposition of red oxide of mercury requires so high a\r\n       temperature, near redness, as to soften ordinary glass, it is\r\n       necessary for this experiment to take a retort (or test tube)\r\n       made of hard glass, which is able to stand high temperatures\r\n       without softening. For the same reason, the lamp used must give\r\n       a strong heat and a large flame, capable of embracing the whole\r\n       bottom of the retort, which should be as small as possible for\r\n       the convenience of the experiment.\r\n\r\n  [19] [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Apparatus for distilling under a\r\n       diminished pressure liquids which decompose at their boiling\r\n       points under the ordinary pressure. The apparatus in which the\r\n       liquid is distilled is connected with a large globe from which the\r\n       air is pumped out; the liquid is heated, and the receiver cooled.]\r\n\r\n       The pneumatic trough may naturally be made of any material\r\n       (china, earthenware, or metal, &c.), but usually a glass one,\r\n       as shown in the drawing, is used, as it allows the progress\r\n       of the experiment to be better observed. For this reason, as\r\n       well as the ease with which they are kept clean, and from the\r\n       fact also that glass is not acted on by many substances which\r\n       affect other materials (for instance, metals), glass vessels\r\n       of all kinds--such as retorts, test tubes, cylinders, beakers,\r\n       flasks, globes, &c.--are preferred to any other for chemical\r\n       experiments. Glass vessels may be heated without any danger if\r\n       the following precautions be observed: 1st, they should be made\r\n       of thin glass, as otherwise they are liable to crack from the bad\r\n       heat-conducting power of glass; 2nd, they should be surrounded\r\n       by a liquid or with sand (Fig. 2), or sand bath as it is called;\r\n       or else should stand in a current of hot gases without touching\r\n       the fuel from which they proceed, or in the flame of a smokeless\r\n       lamp. A common candle or lamp forms a deposit of soot on a\r\n       cold object placed in their flames. The soot interferes with\r\n       the transmission of heat, and so a glass vessel when covered\r\n       with soot often cracks. And for this reason spirit lamps, which\r\n       burn with a smokeless flame, or gas burners of a peculiar\r\n       construction, are used. In the Bunsen burner the gas is mixed\r\n       with air, and burns with a non-luminous and smokeless flame.\r\n       On the other hand, if an ordinary lamp (petroleum or benzine)\r\n       does not smoke it may be used for heating a glass vessel without\r\n       danger, provided the glass is placed well above the flame in the\r\n       current of hot gases. In all cases, the heating should be begun\r\n       very carefully by raising the temperature by degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [20] In order to avoid the necessity of holding the cylinder, its open\r\n       end is widened (and also ground so that it may be closely covered\r\n       with a ground-glass plate when necessary), and placed on a stand\r\n       below the level of the water in the bath. This stand is called\r\n       'the bridge.' It has several circular openings cut through it,\r\n       and the gas delivery tube is placed under one of these, and the\r\n       cylinder for collecting the gas over it.\r\n\r\n4. In order to illustrate by experiment one more example of chemical\r\nchange and the application of the law of the indestructibility of\r\nmatter, we will consider the reaction between common table salt and\r\nlunar caustic, which is well known from its use in cauterising wounds.\r\nBy taking a clear solution of each and mixing them together, it will at\r\nonce be observed that a solid white substance is formed, which settles\r\nto the bottom of the vessel, and is insoluble in water. This substance\r\nmay be separated from the solution by filtering; it is then found to be\r\nan entirely different substance from either of those taken originally in\r\nthe solutions. This is at once evident from the fact that it does not\r\ndissolve in water. On evaporating the liquid which passed through the\r\nfilter, it will be found to contain a new substance unlike either table\r\nsalt or lunar caustic, but, like them, soluble in water. Thus table salt\r\nand lunar caustic, two substances soluble in water, produced, by their\r\nmutual chemical action, two new substances, one insoluble in water, and\r\nthe other remaining in solution. Here, from two substances, two others\r\nare obtained, consequently there occurred a reaction of substitution.\r\nThe water served only to convert the re-acting substances into a liquid\r\nand mobile state. If the lunar caustic and salt be dried[21] and\r\nweighed, and if about 58-1/2 grams[22] of salt and 170 grams of lunar\r\ncaustic be taken, then 143-1/2 grams of insoluble silver chloride and\r\n85 grams of sodium nitrate will be obtained. The sum of the weights\r\nof the re-acting and resultant substances are seen to be similar and\r\nequal to 228-1/2 grams, which necessarily follows from the law of the\r\nindestructibility of matter.\r\n\r\n  [21] Drying is necessary in order to remove any water which may be held\r\n       in the salts (_see_ Note 17, and Chapter I., Notes 13 and 14).\r\n\r\n  [22] The exact weights of the re-acting and resulting substances are\r\n       determined with the greatest difficulty, not only from the\r\n       possible inexactitude of the balance (every weighing is only\r\n       correct within the limits of the sensitiveness of the balance)\r\n       and weights used in weighing, not only from the difficulty in\r\n       making corrections for the weight of air displaced by the vessels\r\n       holding the substances weighed and by the weights themselves, but\r\n       also from the hygroscopic nature of many substances (and vessels)\r\n       causing absorption of moisture from the atmosphere, and from the\r\n       difficulty in not losing any of the substance to be weighed in\r\n       the several operations (filtering, evaporating, and drying, &c.)\r\n       which have to be performed before arriving at a final result. All\r\n       these circumstances have to be taken into consideration in exact\r\n       researches, and their elimination requires very many special\r\n       precautions which are impracticable in preliminary experiments.\r\n\r\nAccepting the truth of the above law, the question naturally arises as\r\nto whether there is any limit to the various chemical transformations,\r\nor are they unrestricted in number--that is to say, is it possible\r\nfrom a given substance to obtain an equivalent quantity of any other\r\nsubstance? In other words, does there exist a perpetual and infinite\r\nchange of one kind of material into every other kind, or is the cycle\r\nof these transformations limited? This is the second essential problem\r\nof Chemistry, a question of quality of matter, and one, it is evident,\r\nwhich is more complicated than the question of quantity. It cannot be\r\nsolved by a mere superficial glance at the subject. Indeed, on seeing\r\nhow all the varied forms and colours of plants are built up from air\r\nand the elements of the soil, and how metallic iron can be transformed\r\ninto colours such as inks and Prussian blue, we might be led to think\r\nthat there is no end to the qualitative changes to which matter is\r\nsusceptible. But, on the other hand, the experiences of everyday life\r\ncompel us to acknowledge that food cannot be made out of a stone, or\r\ngold out of copper. Thus a definite answer can only be looked for in\r\na close and diligent study of the subject, and the problem has been\r\nresolved in different way at different times. In ancient times the\r\nopinion most generally held was that everything visible was composed of\r\nfour elements--Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. The origin of this doctrine\r\ncan be traced far back into the confines of Asia, whence it was handed\r\ndown to the Greeks, and most fully expounded by Empedocles, who lived\r\nbefore 460 B.C. This doctrine was not the result of exact research,\r\nbut apparently owes its origin to the clear division of bodies into\r\ngases (like air), liquids (like water), and solids (like the earth).\r\nThe Arabs appear to have been the first who attempted to solve the\r\nquestion by experimental methods, and they introduced, through Spain,\r\nthe taste for the study of similar problems into Europe, where from\r\nthat time there appear many adepts in chemistry, which was considered\r\nas an unholy art, and called 'alchemy.' As the alchemists were ignorant\r\nof any exact law which could guide them in their researches, they\r\nobtained most anomalous results. Their chief service to chemistry\r\nwas that they made a number of experiments, and discovered many new\r\nchemical transformations; but it is well known how they solved the\r\nfundamental problem of chemistry. Their view may be taken as a positive\r\nacknowledgment of the infinite transmutability of matter, for they aimed\r\nat discovering the Philosopher's Stone, capable of converting everything\r\ninto gold and diamonds, and of making the old young again. This solution\r\nof the question was afterwards completely overthrown, but it must not,\r\nfor this reason, be thought that the hopes held by the alchemists were\r\nonly the fruit of their imaginations. The first chemical experiments\r\nmight well lead them to their conclusions. They took, for instance,\r\nthe bright metallic mineral galena, and extracted metallic lead from\r\nit. Thus they saw that from a metallic substance which is unfitted for\r\nuse they could obtain another metallic substance which is ductile and\r\nvaluable for many technical purposes. Furthermore, they took this lead\r\nand obtained silver, a still more valuable metal, from it. Thus they\r\nmight easily conclude that it was possible to ennoble metals by means of\r\na whole series of transmutations--that is to say, to obtain from them\r\nthose which are more and more precious. Having got silver from lead,\r\nthey assumed that it would be possible to obtain gold from silver. The\r\nmistake they made was that they never weighed or measured the substances\r\nused or produced in their experiments. Had they done so, they would have\r\nlearnt that the weight of the lead was much less than that of the galena\r\nfrom which it was obtained, and the weight of the silver infinitesimal\r\ncompared with that of the lead. Had they looked more closely into\r\nthe process of the extraction of the silver from lead (and silver at\r\nthe present time is chiefly obtained from the lead ores) they would\r\nhave seen that the lead does not change into silver, but that it only\r\ncontains a certain small quantity of it, and this amount having once\r\nbeen separated from the lead it cannot by any further operation give\r\nmore. The silver which the alchemists extracted from the lead was in the\r\nlead, and was not obtained by a chemical change of the lead itself. This\r\nis now well known from experiment, but the first view of the nature of\r\nthe process was very likely to be an erroneous one.[23] The methods of\r\nresearch adopted by the alchemists could give but little success, for\r\nthey did not set themselves clear and simple questions whose answers\r\nwould aid them to make further progress. Thus though they did not\r\narrive at any exact law, they left nevertheless numerous and useful\r\nexperimental data as an inheritance to chemistry; they investigated, in\r\nparticular, the transformations proper to metals, and for this reason\r\nchemistry was for long afterwards entirely confined to the study of\r\nmetallic substances.\r\n\r\n  [23] Besides which, in the majority of cases, the first explanation of\r\n       most subjects which do not repeat themselves in everyday\r\n       experience under various aspects, but always in one form, or\r\n       only at intervals and infrequently, is usually wrong. Thus\r\n       the daily evidence of the rising of the sun and stars evokes\r\n       the erroneous idea that the heavens move and the earth stands\r\n       still. This apparent truth is far from being the real truth,\r\n       and, as a matter of fact, is contradictory to it. Similarly, an\r\n       ordinary mind and everyday experience concludes that iron is\r\n       incombustible, whereas it burns not only as filings, but even as\r\n       wire, as we shall afterwards see. With the progress of knowledge\r\n       very many primitive prejudices have been obliged to give way to\r\n       true ideas which have been verified by experiment. In ordinary\r\n       life we often reason at first sight with perfect truth, only\r\n       because we are taught a right judgment by our daily experience.\r\n       It is a necessary consequence of the nature of our minds to reach\r\n       the attainment of truth through elementary and often erroneous\r\n       reasoning and through experiment, and it would be very wrong\r\n       to expect a knowledge of truth from a simple mental effort.\r\n       Naturally, experiment itself cannot give truth, but it gives the\r\n       means of destroying erroneous representations whilst confirming\r\n       those which are true in all their consequences.\r\n\r\nIn their researches, the alchemists frequently made use of two chemical\r\nprocesses which are now termed 'reduction' and 'oxidation.' The rusting\r\nof metals, and in general their conversion from a metallic into an\r\nearthy form, is called 'oxidation,' whilst the extraction of a metal\r\nfrom an earthy substance is called 'reduction.' Many metals--for\r\ninstance, iron, lead, and tin--are oxidised by heating in air alone,\r\nand may be again reduced by heating with carbon. Such oxidised metals\r\nare found in the earth, and form the majority of metallic ores. The\r\nmetals, such as tin, iron, and copper, may be extracted from these ores\r\nby heating them together with carbon. All these processes were well\r\nstudied by the alchemists. It was afterwards shown that all earths and\r\nminerals are formed of similar metallic rusts or oxides, or of their\r\ncombinations. Thus the alchemists knew of two forms of chemical changes:\r\nthe oxidation of metals and the reduction of the oxides so formed\r\ninto metals. The explanation of the nature of these two classes of\r\nchemical phenomena was the means for the discovery of the most important\r\nchemical laws. The first hypothesis on their nature is due to Becker,\r\nand more particularly to Stahl, a surgeon to the King of Prussia.\r\nStahl writes in his 'Fundamenta Chymiæ,' 1723, that all substances\r\nconsist of an imponderable fiery substance called 'phlogiston' (materia\r\naut principium ignis non ipse ignis), and of another element having\r\nparticular properties for each substance. The greater the capacity of\r\na body for oxidation, or the more combustible it is, the richer it is\r\nin phlogiston. Carbon contains it in great abundance. In oxidation or\r\ncombustion phlogiston is emitted, and in reduction it is consumed or\r\nenters into combination. Carbon reduces earthy substances because it is\r\nrich in phlogiston, and gives up a portion of its phlogiston to the\r\nsubstance reduced. Thus Stahl supposed metals to be compound substances\r\nconsisting of phlogiston and an earthy substance or oxide. This\r\nhypothesis is distinguished for its very great simplicity, and for this\r\nand other reasons it acquired many supporters.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] It is true that Stahl was acquainted with a fact which directly\r\n       disproved his hypothesis. It was already known (from the\r\n       experiments of Geber, and more especially of Ray, in 1630) that\r\n       metals increase in weight by oxidation, whilst, according to\r\n       Stahl's hypothesis, they should decrease in weight, because\r\n       phlogiston is separated by oxidation. Stahl speaks on this\r\n       point as follows:--'I am well aware that metals, in their\r\n       transformation into earths, increase in weight. But not only does\r\n       this fact not disprove my theory, but, on the contrary, confirms\r\n       it, for phlogiston is lighter than air, and, in combining\r\n       with substances, strives to lift them, and so decreases their\r\n       weight; consequently, a substance which has lost phlogiston\r\n       must be heavier.' This argument, it will be seen, is founded\r\n       on a misconception of the properties of gases, regarding them\r\n       as having no weight and as not being attracted by the earth,\r\n       or else on a confused idea of phlogiston itself, since it was\r\n       first defined as imponderable. The conception of imponderable\r\n       phlogiston tallies well with the habit and methods of the last\r\n       century, when recourse was often had to imponderable fluids for\r\n       explaining a large number of phenomena. Heat, light, magnetism,\r\n       and electricity were explained as being peculiar imponderable\r\n       fluids. In this sense the doctrine of Stahl corresponds entirely\r\n       with the spirit of his age. If heat be now regarded as motion\r\n       or energy, then phlogiston also should be considered in this\r\n       light. In fact, in combustion, of coals for instance, heat and\r\n       energy are evolved, and not combined in the coal, although the\r\n       oxygen and coal do combine. Consequently, the doctrine of Stahl\r\n       contains the essence of a true representation of the evolution\r\n       of energy, but naturally this evolution is only a consequence of\r\n       the combination occurring between the coal and oxygen. As regards\r\n       the history of chemistry prior to Lavoisier, besides Stahl's\r\n       work (to which reference has been made above), Priestley's\r\n       _Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air_, London,\r\n       1790, and also Scheele's _Opuscula Chimica et Physica_, Lips.,\r\n       1788-89, 2 vols., must be recommended as the two leading works\r\n       of the English and Scandinavian chemists showing the condition\r\n       of chemical learning before the propagation of Lavoisier's\r\n       views, and containing also many important observations which lie\r\n       at the basis of the chemistry of our times. A most interesting\r\n       memoir on the history of phlogiston is that of Rodwell, in the\r\n       _Philosophical Magazine_, 1868, in which it is shown that the\r\n       idea of phlogiston dates very far back, that Basil Valentine\r\n       (1394-1415), in the _Cursus Triumphalis Antimonii_, Paracelsus\r\n       (1493-1541), in his work, _De Rerum Natura_, Glauber (1604-1668),\r\n       and especially John Joachim Becher (1625-1682), in his _Physica\r\n       Subterranea_, all referred to phlogiston, but under different\r\n       names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Lavoisier's apparatus for determining the\r\ncomposition of air and the reason of metals increasing in weight when\r\nthey are calcined in air.]\r\n\r\nLavoisier proved by means of the balance that every case of rusting of\r\nmetals or oxidation, or of combustion, is accompanied by an increase\r\nin weight at the expense of the atmosphere. He formed, therefore, the\r\nnatural opinion that the heavier substance is more complex than the\r\nlighter one.[25] Lavoisier's celebrated experiment, made in 1774,\r\ngave indubitable support to his opinion, which in many respects was\r\ncontradictory to Stahl's doctrine. Lavoisier poured four ounces of pure\r\nmercury into a glass retort (fig. 3), whose neck was bent as shown in\r\nthe drawing and dipped into the vessel R S, also full of mercury. The\r\nprojecting end of the neck was covered with a glass bell-jar P. The\r\nweight of all the mercury taken, and the volume of air remaining in\r\nthe apparatus, namely, that in the upper portion of the retort, and\r\nunder the bell-jar, were determined before beginning the experiment.\r\nIt was most important in this experiment to know the volume of air in\r\norder to learn what part it played in the oxidation of the mercury,\r\nbecause, according to Stahl, phlogiston is emitted into the air, whilst,\r\naccording to Lavoisier, the mercury in oxidising absorbs a portion of\r\nthe air; and consequently it was absolutely necessary to determine\r\nwhether the amount of air increased or decreased in the oxidation of\r\nthe metal. It was, therefore, most important to measure the volume of\r\nthe air in the apparatus both before and after the experiment. For this\r\npurpose it was necessary to know the total capacity of the retort,\r\nthe volume of the mercury poured into it, the volume of the bell-jar\r\nabove the level of the mercury, and also the temperature and pressure\r\nof the air at the time of its measurement. The volume of air contained\r\nin the apparatus and isolated from the surrounding atmosphere could\r\nbe determined from these data. Having arranged his apparatus in this\r\nmanner, Lavoisier heated the retort holding the mercury for a period\r\nof twelve days at a temperature near the boiling point of mercury. The\r\nmercury became covered with a quantity of small red scales; that is,\r\nit was oxidised or converted into an earth. This substance is the same\r\nmercury oxide which has already been mentioned (example 3). After the\r\nlapse of twelve days the apparatus was cooled, and it was then seen that\r\nthe volume of the air in the apparatus had diminished during the time\r\nof the experiment. This result was in exact contradiction to Stahl's\r\nhypothesis. Out of 50 cubic inches of air originally taken, there only\r\nremained 42. Lavoisier's experiment led to other equally important\r\nresults. The weight of the air taken decreased by as much as the weight\r\nof the mercury increased in oxidising; that is, the portion of the air\r\nwas not destroyed, but only combined with mercury. This portion of\r\nthe air may be again separated from the mercury oxide and has, as we\r\nsaw (example 3), properties different from those of air. It is called\r\n'oxygen.' That portion of the air which remained in the apparatus and\r\ndid not combine with the mercury does not oxidise metals, and cannot\r\nsupport either combustion or respiration, so that a lighted taper is\r\nimmediately extinguished if it be dipped into the gas which remains\r\nin the bell-jar. 'It is extinguished in the residual gas as if it had\r\nbeen plunged into water,' writes Lavoisier in his memoirs. This gas is\r\ncalled 'nitrogen.' Thus air is not a simple substance, but consists of\r\ntwo gases, oxygen and nitrogen, and therefore the opinion that air is\r\nan elementary substance is erroneous. The oxygen of the air is absorbed\r\nin combustion and the oxidation of metals, and the earths produced by\r\nthe oxidation of metals are substances composed of oxygen and a metal.\r\nBy mixing the oxygen with the nitrogen the same air as was originally\r\ntaken is re-formed. It has also been shown by direct experiment that\r\non reducing an oxide with carbon, the oxygen contained in the oxide is\r\ntransferred to the carbon, and gives the same gas that is obtained by\r\nthe combustion of carbon in air. Therefore this gas is a compound of\r\ncarbon and oxygen, just as the earthy oxides are composed of metals and\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\n  [25] An Englishman, named Mayow, who lived a whole century before\r\n       Lavoisier (in 1666), understood certain phenomena of oxidation\r\n       in their true aspect, but was not able to develop his views\r\n       with clearness, or support them by conclusive experiments; he\r\n       cannot therefore be considered, like Lavoisier, as the founder of\r\n       contemporary chemical learning. Science is a universal heritage,\r\n       and therefore it is only just to give the highest honour in\r\n       science, not to those who first enunciate a certain truth, but to\r\n       those who are first able to convince others of its authenticity\r\n       and establish it for the general welfare. But scientific\r\n       discoveries are rarely made all at once; as a rule, the first\r\n       teachers do not succeed in convincing others of the truth they\r\n       have discovered; with time, however, a true herald comes forward,\r\n       possessing every means for making the truth apparent to all, but\r\n       it must not be forgotten that such are entirely indebted to the\r\n       labours and mass of data accumulated by many others. Such was\r\n       Lavoisier, and such are all the great founders of science. They\r\n       are the enunciators of all past and present learning, and their\r\n       names will always be revered by posterity.\r\n\r\nThe many examples of the formation and decomposition of substances which\r\nare met with convince us that the majority of substances with which\r\nwe have to deal are compounds made up of several other substances. By\r\nheating chalk (or else copper carbonate, as in the second example)\r\nwe obtain lime and the same carbonic acid gas which is produced by\r\nthe combustion of carbon. On bringing lime into contact with this gas\r\nand water, at the ordinary temperature, we again obtain the compound,\r\ncarbonate of lime, or chalk. Therefore chalk is a compound. So also are\r\nthose substances from which it may be built up. Carbonic anhydride is\r\nformed by the combination of carbon and oxygen; and lime is produced\r\nby the oxidation of a certain metal called 'calcium.' By resolving\r\nsubstances in this manner into their component parts, we arrive at\r\nlast at such as are indivisible into two or more substances by any\r\nmeans whatever, and which cannot be formed from other substances. All\r\nwe can do is to make such substances combine together to act on other\r\nsubstances. Substances which cannot be formed from or decomposed into\r\nothers are termed _simple substances_ (elements). Thus all homogeneous\r\nsubstances may be classified into simple and compound substances. This\r\nview was introduced and established as a scientific fact during the\r\nlifetime of Lavoisier. The number of these elements is very small in\r\ncomparison with the number of compound substances which are formed\r\nby them. At the present time, only seventy elements are known with\r\ncertainty to exist. Some of them are very rarely met with in nature, or\r\nare found in very small quantities, whilst the existence of others is\r\nstill doubtful. The number of elements with whose compounds we commonly\r\ndeal in everyday life is very small. Elements cannot be transmuted\r\ninto one another--at least up to the present not a single case of such\r\na transformation has been met with; it may therefore be said that, as\r\nyet, it is impossible to transmute one metal into another. And as yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the number of attempts which have been made in this\r\ndirection, no fact has been discovered which could in any way support\r\nthe idea of the complexity of such well-known elements[26] as oxygen,\r\niron, sulphur, &c. Therefore, from its very conception, an element is\r\nnot susceptible to reactions of decomposition.[27]\r\n\r\n  [26] Many of the ancient philosophers assumed the existence of one\r\n       elementary form of matter. This idea still appears in our times,\r\n       in the constant efforts which are made to reduce the number of\r\n       the elements; to prove, for instance, that bromine contains\r\n       chlorine or that chlorine contains oxygen. Many methods, founded\r\n       both on experiment and theory, have been tried to prove the\r\n       compound nature of the elements. All labour in this direction has\r\n       as yet been in vain, and the assurance that elementary matter\r\n       is not so homogeneous (single) as the mind would desire in its\r\n       first transport of rapid generalisation is strengthened from year\r\n       to year. All our knowledge shows that iron and other elements\r\n       remain, even at such a high temperature as there exists in the\r\n       sun, as different substances, and are not converted into one\r\n       common material. Admitting, even mentally, the possibility of one\r\n       elementary form of matter, a method must be imagined by which\r\n       it could give rise to the various elements, as also the _modus\r\n       operandi_ of their formation from one material. If it be said\r\n       that this diversitude only takes place at low temperatures, as is\r\n       observed with isomerides, then there would be reason to expect,\r\n       if not the transition of the various elements into one particular\r\n       and more stable form, at least the mutual transformation of some\r\n       into others. But nothing of the kind has as yet been observed,\r\n       and the alchemist's hope to manufacture (as Berthollet puts it)\r\n       elements has no theoretical or practical foundation.\r\n\r\n  [27] The weakest point in the idea of elements is the negative\r\n       character of the determinative signs given them by Lavoisier, and\r\n       from that time ruling in chemistry. They do _not_ decompose, they\r\n       do _not_ change into one another. But it must be remarked that\r\n       elements form the limiting horizon of our knowledge of matter,\r\n       and it is always difficult to determine a positive side on the\r\n       borderland of what is known. Besides, there is no doubt (from the\r\n       results of spectrum analysis) that the elements are distributed\r\n       as far as the most distant stars, and that they support the\r\n       highest attainable temperatures without decomposing.\r\n\r\nThe quantity, therefore, of each element remains constant in all\r\nchemical changes: a fact which may be deduced as a consequence of\r\nthe law of the indestructibility of matter, and of the conception\r\nof elements themselves. Thus the equation expressing the law of the\r\nindestructibility of matter acquires a new and still more important\r\nsignification. If we know the quantities of the elements which occur in\r\nthe re-acting substances, and if from these substances there proceed, by\r\nmeans of chemical changes, a series of new compound substances, then the\r\nlatter will together contain the same quantity of each of the elements\r\nas there originally existed in the re-acting substances. The essence\r\nof chemical change is embraced in the study of how, and with what\r\nsubstances, each element is combined before and after change.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to express various chemical changes by equations,\r\nit has been agreed to represent each element by the first or some two\r\nletters of its (Latin) name. Thus, for example, oxygen is represented by\r\nthe letter O; nitrogen by N; mercury (hydrargyrum) by Hg; iron (ferrum)\r\nby Fe; and so on for all the elements, as is seen in the tables on\r\npage 24. A compound substance is represented by placing the symbols\r\nrepresenting the elements of which it is made up side by side. For\r\nexample, red mercury oxide is represented by HgO, which shows that it\r\nis composed of oxygen and mercury. Besides this, the symbol of every\r\nelement corresponds with a certain relative quantity of it by weight,\r\ncalled its 'combining' weight, or the weight of an atom; so that the\r\nchemical formula of a compound substance not only designates the nature\r\nof the elements of which it is composed, but also their quantitative\r\nproportion. Every chemical process may be expressed by an equation\r\ncomposed of the formulæ corresponding with those substances which take\r\npart in it and are produced by it. The amount by weight of the elements\r\nin every chemical equation must be equal on both sides of the equation,\r\nsince no element is either formed or destroyed in a chemical change.\r\n\r\nOn pages 24, 25, and 26 a list of the elements, with their symbols and\r\ncombining or atomic weights, is given, and we shall see afterwards on\r\nwhat basis the atomic weights of elements are determined. At present we\r\nwill only point out that a compound containing the elements A and B is\r\ndesignated by the formula A_n_ B_m_, where _m_ and _n_ are the\r\ncoefficients or multiples in which the combining weights of the elements\r\nenter into the composition of the substance. If we represent the\r\ncombining weight of the substance A by _a_ and that of the substance B by\r\n_b_, then the composition of the substance A_n_ B_m_ will be expressed\r\nthus: it contains _na_ parts by weight of the substance A and _mb_ parts\r\nby weight of the substance B, and consequently 100 parts of our compound\r\ncontain _na_ 100/_na_ + _mb_ percentage parts by weight of the substance\r\nA and _mb_ 100/_na_ + _mb_ of the substance B. It is evident that as a\r\nformula shows the relative amounts of all the elements contained in a\r\ncompound, the actual weights of the elements contained in a given weight\r\nof a compound may be calculated from its formula. For example, the\r\nformula NaCl of table salt shows (as Na = 23 and Cl = 35·5) that 58·5\r\nlbs. of salt contain 23 lbs. of sodium and 35·5 lbs. of chlorine, and\r\nthat 100 parts of it contain 39·3 per cent. of sodium and 60·7 per cent.\r\nof chlorine.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said above clearly limits the province of chemical\r\nchanges, because from substances of a given kind there can be obtained\r\nonly such as contain the same elements. Even with this limitation,\r\nhowever, the number of possible combinations is infinitely great. Only\r\na comparatively small number of compounds have yet been described or\r\nsubjected to research, and any one working in this direction may easily\r\ndiscover new compounds which had not before been obtained. It often\r\nhappens, however, that such newly-discovered compounds were foreseen by\r\nchemistry, whose object is the apprehension of that uniformity which\r\nrules over the multitude of compound substances, and whose aim is the\r\ncomprehension of those laws which govern their formation and properties.\r\nThe conception of elements having been established, the next objects\r\nof chemistry were: the determination of the properties of compound\r\nsubstances on the basis of the determination of the quantity and kind of\r\nelements of which they are composed; the investigation of the elements\r\nthemselves; the determination of what compound substances can be formed\r\nfrom each element and the properties which these compounds show; and\r\nthe apprehension of the nature of the connection between the elements\r\nin different compounds. An element thus serves as the starting point,\r\nand is taken as the primary conception on which all other substances are\r\nbuilt up.\r\n\r\nWhen we state that a certain element enters into the composition of a\r\ngiven compound (when we say, for instance, that mercury oxide contains\r\noxygen) we do not mean that it contains oxygen as a gaseous substance,\r\nbut only desire to express those transformations which mercury oxide\r\nis capable of making; that is, we wish to say that it is possible to\r\nobtain oxygen from mercury oxide, and that it can give up oxygen to\r\nvarious other substances; in a word, we desire only to express those\r\ntransformations of which mercury oxide is capable. Or, more concisely,\r\nit may be said that the _composition_ of a compound is the expression\r\nof those transformations of which it is capable. It is useful in this\r\nsense to make a clear distinction between the conception of an element\r\nas a _separate_ homogeneous substance, and as a _material_ but invisible\r\n_part_ of a compound. Mercury oxide does not contain two simple bodies,\r\na gas and a metal, but two elements, mercury and oxygen, which, when\r\nfree, are a gas and a metal. Neither mercury as a metal nor oxygen as\r\na gas is contained in mercury oxide; it only contains the substance of\r\nthese elements, just as steam only contains the substance of ice, but\r\nnot ice itself, or as corn contains the substance of the seed, but not\r\nthe seed itself. The existence of an element may be recognised without\r\nknowing it in the uncombined state, but only from an investigation\r\nof its combinations, and from the knowledge that it gives, under\r\nall possible conditions, substances which are unlike other known\r\ncombinations of substances. Fluorine is an example of this kind. It was\r\nfor a long time unknown in a free state, and nevertheless was recognised\r\nas an element because its combinations with other elements were known,\r\nand their difference from all other similar compound substances was\r\ndetermined. In order to grasp the difference between the conception of\r\nthe visible form of an element as we know it in the free state, and of\r\nthe intrinsic element (or 'radicle,' as Lavoisier called it) contained\r\nin the visible form, it should be remarked that compound substances\r\nalso combine together forming yet more complex compounds, and that\r\nthey evolve heat in the process of combination. The original compound\r\nmay often be extracted from these new compounds by exactly the same\r\nmethods as elements are extracted from their corresponding combinations.\r\nBesides, many elements exist under various visible forms whilst the\r\nintrinsic element contained in these various forms is something which is\r\nnot subject to change. Thus carbon appears as charcoal, graphite, and\r\ndiamond, but yet the element carbon alone, contained in each, is one\r\nand the same. Carbonic anhydride contains carbon, and not charcoal, or\r\ngraphite, or the diamond.\r\n\r\nElements alone, although not all of them, have the peculiar lustre,\r\nopacity, malleability, and the great heat and electrical conductivity\r\nwhich are proper to metals and their mutual combinations. But elements\r\nare far from all being _metals_. Those which do not possess the physical\r\nproperties of metals are called _non-metals_ (or _metalloids_). It\r\nis, however, impossible to draw a strict line of demarcation between\r\nmetals and non-metals, there being many intermediary substances. Thus\r\ngraphite, from which pencils are manufactured, is an element with the\r\nlustre and other properties of a metal; but charcoal and the diamond,\r\nwhich are composed of the same substance as graphite, do not show any\r\nmetallic properties. Both classes of elements are clearly distinguished\r\nin definite examples, but in particular cases the distinction is not\r\nclear and cannot serve as a basis for the exact division of the elements\r\ninto two groups.\r\n\r\nThe conception of elements forms the basis of chemical knowledge, and\r\nin giving a list of them at the very beginning of our work, we wish to\r\ntabulate our present knowledge on the subject. Altogether about seventy\r\nelements are now authentically known, but many of them are so rarely met\r\nwith in nature, and have been obtained in such small quantities, that\r\nwe possess but a very insufficient knowledge of them. The substances\r\nmost widely distributed in nature contain a very small number of\r\nelements. These elements have been more completely studied than the\r\nothers, because a greater number of investigators have been able to\r\ncarry on experiments and observations on them. The elements most widely\r\ndistributed in nature are:--\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen,   H  = 1.      In water, and in animal and vegetable\r\n                             organisms.\r\n  Carbon,     C  = 12.     In organisms, coal, limestones.\r\n  Nitrogen,   N  = 14.

In the earth, iron ores, and in organisms.\r\n\r\nBesides these, the following elements, although not very largely\r\ndistributed in nature, are all more or less well known from their\r\napplications to the requirements of everyday life or the arts, either in\r\na free state or in their compounds:--\r\n\r\n  Lithium,    Li = 7.     In medicine (Li_{2}CO_{3}), and in photography\r\n                            (LiBr).\r\n  Boron,      B = 11.

In green fluorescent glass.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of the following metals and semi-metals have fewer\r\napplications, but are well known, and are somewhat frequently met with\r\nin nature, although in small quantities:--\r\n\r\n           Beryllium,  Be = 9.           Palladium,  Pd = 107.\r\n           Titanium,   Ti = 48.          Cerium,     Ce = 140.\r\n           Vanadium,   V  = 51.          Tungsten,   W  = 184.\r\n           Selenium,   Se = 79.          Osmium,     Os = 192.\r\n           Zirconium,  Zr = 91.          Iridium,    Ir = 193.\r\n           Molybdenum, Mo = 96.          Thallium,   Tl = 204.\r\n\r\nThe following rare metals are still more seldom met with in nature, but\r\nhave been studied somewhat fully:--\r\n\r\n          Scandium,   Sc = 44.           Germanium,  Ge = 72.\r\n          Gallium,    Ga = 70.           Rubidium,   Rb = 86.\r\n          Yttrium,    Y =  89.           Cæsium,     Cs = 133.\r\n          Niobium,    Nb = 94.           Lanthanum,  La = 138.\r\n          Ruthenium,  Ru = 102.          Didymium,   Di = 142.\r\n          Rhodium,    Rh = 103.          Ytterbium,  Yb = 173.\r\n          Indium,     In = 114.          Tantalum,   Ta = 183.\r\n          Tellurium,  Te = 125.          Thorium,    Th = 232.\r\n\r\nBesides these 66 elements there have been discovered:--Erbium, Terbium,\r\nSamarium, Thullium, Holmium, Mosandrium, Phillipium, and several\r\nothers. But their properties and combinations, owing to their extreme\r\nrarity, are very little known, and even their existence as independent\r\nsubstances[28] is doubtful.\r\n\r\n  [28] Possibly some of their compounds are compounds of other\r\n       already-known elements. Pure and incontestably independent\r\n       compounds of these substances are unknown, and some of them have\r\n       not even been separated, but are only supposed to exist from the\r\n       results of spectroscopic researches. There can be no mention\r\n       of such contestable and doubtful elements in a short general\r\n       handbook of chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt has been incontestably proved from observations on the spectra of\r\nthe heavenly bodies that many of the commoner elements (such as H, Na,\r\nMg, Fe) occur on the far distant stars. This fact confirms the belief\r\nthat those forms of matter which appear on the earth as elements are\r\nwidely distributed over the entire universe. But we do not yet know why,\r\nin nature, the mass of some elements should be greater than that of\r\nothers.[28 bis]\r\n\r\n  [28 bis] Clark in America made an approximate calculation of the amount\r\n       of the different elements contained in the earth's crust (to a\r\n       depth of 15 kilometres), and found that the chief mass (over 50\r\n       per cent.) is composed of oxygen; then comes silicon, &c.; while\r\n       the amount of hydrogen is less than 1 per cent., carbon scarcely\r\n       0·25 per cent., nitrogen even less than 0·03 per cent. The\r\n       relative masses of such metals as Cu, Ni, Au is minute. Judging\r\n       from the density (see Chapter VIII.) of the earth, a large\r\n       proportion of its mass must be composed of iron.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of each element to combine with one or another element,\r\nand to form compounds with them which are in a greater or less degree\r\nprone to give new and yet more complex substances, forms the fundamental\r\ncharacter of each element. Thus sulphur easily combines with the\r\nmetals, oxygen, chlorine, or carbon, whilst gold and silver enter\r\ninto combinations with difficulty, and form unstable compounds, which\r\nare easily decomposed by heat. The cause or force which induces the\r\nelements to enter into chemical change must be considered, as also the\r\ncause which holds different substances in combination--that is, which\r\nendues the substances formed with their particular degree of stability.\r\nThis cause or force is called _affinity_ (_affinitas_, _affinité_,\r\n_Verwandtschaft_), or chemical affinity.[29] Since this force must\r\nbe regarded as exclusively an attractive force, like gravity, many\r\nwriters (for instance, Bergmann at the end of the last, and Berthollet\r\nat the beginning of this, century) supposed affinity to be essentially\r\nsimilar to the universal force of gravity, from which it only differs\r\nin that the latter acts at observable distances whilst affinity only\r\nevinces itself at the smallest possible distances. But chemical\r\naffinity cannot be entirely identified with the universal attraction\r\nof gravity, which acts at appreciable distances and is dependent\r\nonly on mass and distance, and not on the quality of the material on\r\nwhich it acts, whilst it is by the quality of matter that affinity is\r\nmost forcibly influenced. Neither can it be entirely identified with\r\ncohesion, which gives to homogeneous solid substances their crystalline\r\nform, elasticity, hardness, ductility, and other properties, and to\r\nliquids their surface tension, drop formation, capillarity, and other\r\nproperties, because affinity acts between the component parts of a\r\nsubstance and cohesion on a substance in its homogeneity, although both\r\nact at imperceptible distances (by contact) and have much in common.\r\nChemical force, which makes one substance penetrate into another,\r\ncannot be entirely identified with even those attracting forces which\r\nmake different substances adhere to each other, or hold together (as\r\nwhen two plane-polished surfaces of solid substances are brought into\r\nclose contact), or which cause liquids to soak into solids, or adhere\r\nto their surfaces, or gases and vapours to condense on the surfaces\r\nof solids. These forces must not be confounded with chemical forces,\r\nwhich cause one substance to penetrate into the substance of another\r\nand to form a new substance, which is never the case with cohesion.\r\nBut it is evident that the forces which determine cohesion form a\r\nconnecting-link between mechanical and chemical forces, because they\r\nonly act by intimate contact. For a long time, and especially during\r\nthe first half of this century, chemical attraction and chemical forces\r\nwere identified with electrical forces. There is certainly an intimate\r\nrelation between them, for electricity is evolved in chemical reactions,\r\nand has also a powerful influence on chemical processes--for instance,\r\ncompounds are decomposed by the action of an electrical current. And the\r\nexactly similar relation which exists between chemical phenomena and the\r\nphenomena of heat (heat being developed by chemical phenomena, and heat\r\nbeing able to decompose compounds) only proves the unity of the forces\r\nof nature, the capability of one force to produce and to be transformed\r\ninto others. For this reason the identification of chemical force\r\nwith electricity will not bear experimental proof.[30] As of all the\r\n(molecular) phenomena of nature which act on substances at immeasurably\r\nsmall distances, the phenomena of heat are at present the best\r\n(comparatively) known, having been reduced to the simplest fundamental\r\nprinciples of mechanics (of energy, equilibrium, and movement), which,\r\nsince Newton, have been subjected to strict mathematical analysis, it\r\nis quite natural that an effort, which has been particularly pronounced\r\nduring recent years, should have been made to bring chemical phenomena\r\ninto strict correlation with the already investigated phenomena of\r\nheat, without, however, aiming at any identification of chemical with\r\nheat phenomena. The true nature of chemical force is still a secret\r\nto us, just as is the nature of the universal force of gravity, and\r\nyet without knowing what gravity really is, by applying mechanical\r\nconceptions, astronomical phenomena have been subjected not only to\r\nexact generalisation but to the detailed prediction of a number of\r\nparticular facts; and so, also, although the true nature of chemical\r\naffinity may be unknown, there is reason to hope for considerable\r\nprogress in chemical science by applying the laws of mechanics to\r\nchemical phenomena by means of the mechanical theory of heat. As yet\r\nthis portion of chemistry has been but little worked at, and therefore,\r\nwhile forming a current problem of the science, it is treated more\r\nfully in that particular field which is termed either 'theoretical'\r\nor 'physical' chemistry, or, more correctly, _chemical mechanics_. As\r\nthis province of chemistry requires a knowledge not only of the various\r\nhomogeneous substances which have yet been obtained and of the chemical\r\ntransformations which they undergo, but also of the phenomena (of heat\r\nand other kinds) by which these transformations are accompanied, it\r\nis only possible to enter on the study of chemical mechanics after an\r\nacquaintance with the fundamental chemical conceptions and substances\r\nwhich form the subject of this book.[31]\r\n\r\n  [29] This word, first introduced, if I mistake not, into chemistry\r\n       by Glauber, is based on the idea of the ancient philosophers that\r\n       combination can only take place when the substances combining\r\n       have something in common--a medium. As is generally the case,\r\n       another idea evolved itself in antiquity, and has lived until\r\n       now, side by side with the first, to which it is exactly\r\n       contradictory; this considers union as dependent on contrast, on\r\n       polar difference, on an effort to fill up a want.\r\n\r\n  [30] Especially conclusive are those cases of so-called metalepsis\r\n       (Dumas, Laurent). Chlorine, in combining with hydrogen, forms\r\n       a very stable substance called 'hydrochloric acid,' which is\r\n       split up by the action of an electrical current into chlorine\r\n       and hydrogen, the chlorine appearing at the positive and\r\n       the hydrogen at the negative pole. Hence electro-chemists\r\n       considered hydrogen to be an electro-positive and chlorine\r\n       an electro-negative element, and that they are held together\r\n       in virtue of their opposite electrical charges. It appears,\r\n       however, from metalepsis, that chlorine can replace hydrogen\r\n       (and, inversely, hydrogen can replace chlorine) in its compounds\r\n       without in any way changing the grouping of the other elements,\r\n       or altering their chief chemical properties. For instance, acetic\r\n       acid in which hydrogen has been replaced by chlorine is still\r\n       capable of forming salts. It must be observed, whilst considering\r\n       this subject, that the explanation suggesting electricity as the\r\n       origin of chemical phenomena is unsound, since it attempts to\r\n       explain one class of phenomena whose nature is almost unknown by\r\n       another class which is no better known. It is most instructive\r\n       to remark that together with the electrical theory of chemical\r\n       attraction there arose and survives a view which explains the\r\n       galvanic current as being a transference of chemical action\r\n       through the circuit--_i.e._, regards the origin of electricity as\r\n       being a chemical one. It is evident that the connection is very\r\n       intimate, although both phenomena are independent and represent\r\n       different forms of molecular (atomic) motion, whose real nature\r\n       is not yet understood. Nevertheless, the connection between\r\n       the phenomena of both categories is not only in itself very\r\n       instructive, but it extends the applicability of the general idea\r\n       of the unity of the forces of nature, conviction of the truth of\r\n       which has held so important a place in the science of the last\r\n       ten years.\r\n\r\n  [31] I consider that in an elementary text-book of chemistry, like the\r\n       present, it is only possible and advisable to mention, in\r\n       reference to chemical mechanics, a few general ideas and some\r\n       particular examples referring more especially to gases, whose\r\n       mechanical theory must be regarded as the most complete. The\r\n       molecular mechanics of liquids and solids is as yet in embryo,\r\n       and contains much that is disputable; for this reason, chemical\r\n       mechanics has made less progress in relation to these substances.\r\n       It may not be superfluous here to remark, with respect to the\r\n       conception of chemical affinity, that up to the present time\r\n       gravity, electricity, and heat have all been applied to its\r\n       elucidation. Efforts have also been made to introduce the\r\n       luminiferous ether into theoretical chemistry, and should that\r\n       connection between the phenomena of light and electricity\r\n       which was established by Maxwell be worked out more in detail,\r\n       doubtless these efforts to elucidate all or a great deal by\r\n       the aid of luminiferous ether will again appear in theoretical\r\n       chemistry. An independent chemical mechanics of the material\r\n       particles of matter, and of their internal (atomic) changes,\r\n       would, in my opinion, arise as the result of these efforts.\r\n       Two hundred years ago Newton laid the foundation of a truly\r\n       scientific theoretical mechanics of external visible motion, and\r\n       on this foundation erected the edifice of celestial mechanics.\r\n       One hundred years ago Lavoisier arrived at the first fundamental\r\n       law of the internal mechanics of invisible particles of matter.\r\n       This subject is far from having been developed into a harmonious\r\n       whole, because it is much more difficult, and, although many\r\n       details have been completely investigated, it does not possess\r\n       any starting points. Newton only came after Copernicus and\r\n       Kepler, who had discovered empirically the exterior simplicity\r\n       of celestial phenomena. Lavoisier and Dalton may, in respect to\r\n       the chemical mechanics of the molecular world, be compared to\r\n       Copernicus and Kepler. But a Newton has not yet appeared in the\r\n       molecular world; when he does, I think that he will find the\r\n       fundamental laws of the mechanics of the invisible motions of\r\n       matter more easily and more quickly in the chemical structure\r\n       of matter than in physical phenomena (of electricity, heat,\r\n       and light); for these latter are accomplished by particles of\r\n       matter already arranged, whilst it is now clear that the problem\r\n       of chemical mechanics mainly lies in the apprehension of those\r\n       motions which are invisibly accomplished by the smallest atoms of\r\n       matter.\r\n\r\nAs the chemical changes to which substances are liable proceed from\r\ninternal forces proper to these substances, as chemical phenomena\r\ncertainly consist of motions of material parts (from the laws\r\nof the indestructibility of matter and of elements), and as the\r\ninvestigation of mechanical and physical phenomena proves the law of\r\nthe _indestructibility of forces_, or the conservation of energy--that\r\nis, the possibility of the transformation of one kind of motion into\r\nanother (of visible or mechanical into invisible or physical)--we are\r\ninevitably obliged to acknowledge the presence in substances (and\r\nespecially in the elements of which all others are composed) of a store\r\nof _chemical energy_ or invisible motion inducing them to enter into\r\ncombinations. If heat be evolved in a reaction, it means that a portion\r\nof chemical energy is transformed into heat;[32] if heat be absorbed\r\nin a reaction,[33] that it is partly transformed (rendered latent) into\r\nchemical energy. The store of force or energy going to the formation\r\nof new compounds may, after several combinations, accomplished with an\r\nabsorption of heat, at last diminish to such a degree that indifferent\r\ncompounds will be obtained, although these sometimes, by combining with\r\nenergetic elements or compounds, give more complex compounds, which\r\nmay be capable of entering into chemical combination. Among elements,\r\ngold, platinum, and nitrogen have but little energy, whilst potassium,\r\noxygen, and chlorine have a very marked degree of energy. When\r\ndissimilar substances enter into combination they often form substances\r\nof diminished energy. Thus sulphur and potassium when heated easily burn\r\nin air, but when combined together their compound is neither inflammable\r\nnor burns in air like its component parts. Part of the energy of the\r\npotassium and of the sulphur was evolved in their combination in the\r\nform of heat. Just as in the passage of substances from one physical\r\nstate into another a portion of their store of heat is absorbed or\r\nevolved, so in combinations or decompositions and in every chemical\r\nprocess, there occurs a change in the store of chemical energy, and at\r\nthe same time an evolution or absorption of heat.[34]\r\n\r\n  [32] The theory of heat gave the idea of a store of internal motion\r\n       or energy, and therefore with it, it became necessary to\r\n       acknowledge chemical energy, but there is no foundation whatever\r\n       for identifying heat energy with chemical energy. It may be\r\n       supposed, but not positively affirmed, that heat motion is\r\n       proper to molecules and chemical motion to atoms, but that as\r\n       molecules are made up of atoms, the motion of the one passes to\r\n       the other, and that for this reason heat strongly influences\r\n       reaction and appears or disappears (is absorbed) in reactions.\r\n       These relations, which are apparent and hardly subject to doubt\r\n       on general lines, still present much that is doubtful in detail,\r\n       because all forms of molecular and atomic motion are able to pass\r\n       into each other.\r\n\r\n  [33] The reactions which take place (at the ordinary or at a high\r\n       temperature) directly between substances may be clearly divided\r\n       into exothermal, which are accompanied by an evolution of heat,\r\n       and endothermal, which are accompanied by an absorption of heat.\r\n       It is evident that the latter require a source of heat. They are\r\n       determined either by the directly surrounding medium (as in the\r\n       formation of carbon bisulphide from charcoal and sulphur, or in\r\n       decompositions which take place at high temperatures), or else by\r\n       a secondary reaction proceeding simultaneously, or by some other\r\n       form of energy (light, electricity). So, for instance, hydrogen\r\n       sulphide is decomposed by iodine in the presence of water at the\r\n       expense of the heat which is evolved by the solution in water\r\n       of the hydrogen iodide produced. This is the reason why this\r\n       reaction, as exothermal, only takes place in the presence of\r\n       water; otherwise it would be accompanied by a cooling effect. As\r\n       in the combination of dissimilar substances, the bonds existing\r\n       between the molecules and atoms of the homogeneous substances\r\n       have to be broken asunder, whilst in reactions of rearrangement\r\n       the formation of any one substance proceeds simultaneously with\r\n       the formation of another, and, as in reactions, a series of\r\n       physical and mechanical changes take place, it is impossible to\r\n       separate the heat directly depending on a given reaction from\r\n       the total sum of the observed heat effect. For this reason,\r\n       thermochemical data are very complex, and cannot by themselves\r\n       give the key to many chemical problems, as it was at first\r\n       supposed they might. They ought to form a part of chemical\r\n       mechanics, but alone they do not constitute it.\r\n\r\n  [34] As chemical reactions are effected by heating, so the heat\r\n       absorbed by substances before decomposition or change of\r\n       state, and called 'specific heat,' goes in many cases to the\r\n       preparation, if it may be so expressed, of reaction, even when\r\n       the limit of the temperature of reaction is not attained. The\r\n       molecules of a substance A, which is not able to react on a\r\n       substance B below a temperature _t_, by being heated from a\r\n       somewhat lower temperature to _t_, undergoes that change which\r\n       had to be arrived at for the formation of A B.\r\n\r\nFor the comprehension of chemical phenomena as mechanical\r\nprocesses--_i.e._, the study of the _modus operandi_ of chemical\r\nphenomena--it is most important to consider: (1) the facts gathered\r\nfrom stoïchiometry, or that part of chemistry which treats of the\r\nquantitative relation, by weight or volume, of the reacting substances;\r\n(2) the distinction between the different forms and classes of\r\nchemical reactions; (3) the study of the changes in properties\r\nproduced by alteration in composition; (4) the study of the phenomena\r\nwhich accompany chemical transformation; (5) a generalisation of the\r\nconditions under which reactions occur. As regards stoïchiometry,\r\nthis branch of chemistry has been worked out most thoroughly, and\r\ncomprises laws (of Dalton, Avogadro-Gerhardt, and others) which bear\r\nso deeply on all parts of chemistry that at the present time the chief\r\nproblem of chemical research consists in the application of general\r\nstoïchiometrical laws to concrete examples, _i.e._, the quantitative\r\n(volumetric or gravimetric) composition of substances. All other\r\nbranches of chemistry are clearly subordinate to this most important\r\nportion of chemical knowledge. Even the very signification of reactions\r\nof combination, decomposition, and rearrangement, acquired, as we shall\r\nsee, a particular and new character under the influence of the progress\r\nof exact ideas concerning the quantitative relations of substances\r\nentering into chemical changes. Furthermore, in this sense there arose\r\na new--and, till then, unknown--division of compound substances into\r\n_definite_ and _indefinite_ compounds. Even at the beginning of this\r\ncentury, Berthollet had not made this distinction. But Prout showed\r\nthat a number of compounds contain the substances of which they are they\r\nbreak up, in exact definite proportions by weight, which are unalterable\r\nunder any conditions. Thus, for example, red mercury oxide always\r\ncontains sixteen parts by weight of oxygen for every 200 parts by weight\r\nof mercury, which is expressed by the formula HgO. But in an alloy of\r\ncopper and silver one or the other metal may be added at will, and in an\r\naqueous solution of sugar, the relative proportion of the sugar and water\r\nmay be altered and nevertheless a homogeneous whole with the sum of the\r\nindependent properties will be obtained--_i.e._, in these cases there was\r\nindefinite chemical combination. Although in nature and chemical practice\r\nthe formation of indefinite compounds (such as alloys and solutions)\r\nplays as essential a part as the formation of definite chemical\r\ncompounds, yet, as the stoïchiometrical laws at present apply chiefly to\r\nthe latter, all facts concerning indefinite compounds suffer from\r\ninexactitude, and it is only during recent years that the attention of\r\nchemists has been directed to this province of chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn chemical mechanics it is, from a qualitative point of view, very\r\nimportant to clearly distinguish at the very beginning between\r\n_reversible_ and _non-reversible reactions_. Substances capable of\r\nreacting on each other at a certain temperature produce substances which\r\nat the same temperature either can or cannot give back the original\r\nsubstances. For example, salt dissolves in water at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, and the solution so obtained is capable of breaking up\r\nat the same temperature, leaving salt and separating the water by\r\nevaporation. Carbon bisulphide is formed from sulphur and carbon at\r\nabout the same temperature at which it can be resolved into sulphur\r\nand carbon. Iron, at a certain temperature, separates hydrogen from\r\nwater, forming iron oxide, which, in contact with hydrogen at the same\r\ntemperature, is able to produce iron and water. It is evident that if\r\ntwo substances, A and B, give two others C and D, and the reaction be\r\nreversible, then C and D will form A and B, and, consequently, by taking\r\na definite mass of A and B, or a corresponding mass of C and D, we shall\r\nobtain, in each case, all four substances--that is to say, there will be\r\na state of _chemical equilibrium_ between the reacting substances. By\r\nincreasing the mass of one of the substances we obtain a new condition\r\nof equilibrium, so that reversible reactions present a means of studying\r\nthe _influence of mass_ on the _modus operandi_ of chemical changes.\r\nMany of those reactions which occur with very complicated compounds or\r\nmixtures may serve as examples of non-reversible reactions. Thus many of\r\nthe compound substances of animal and vegetable organisms are broken up\r\nby heat, but cannot be re-formed from their products of decomposition at\r\nany temperature. Gunpowder, as a mixture of sulphur, nitre, and carbon,\r\non being exploded, forms gases from which the original substances cannot\r\nbe re-formed at any temperature. In order to obtain them, recourse\r\nmust be had to an indirect method _of combination at the moment of\r\nseparation_. If A does not under any circumstances combine directly\r\nwith B, it does not follow that it cannot give a compound A B. For A\r\ncan often combine with C and B with D, and if C has a great affinity\r\nfor D, then the reaction of A C or B D produces not only C D, but also\r\nA B. As on the formation of C D, the substances A and B (previously in\r\nA C and B D) are left in a peculiar state of separation, it is supposed\r\nthat their mutual combination occurs because they meet together in this\r\n_nascent state_ at the moment of separation (_in statu nascendi_). Thus\r\nchlorine does not directly combine with charcoal, graphite, or diamond;\r\nthere are, nevertheless, compounds of chlorine with carbon, and many\r\nof them are distinguished by their stability. They are obtained in the\r\naction of chlorine on hydrocarbons, as the separation products from the\r\ndirect action of chlorine on hydrogen. Chlorine takes up the hydrogen,\r\nand the carbon liberated at the moment of its separation, enters into\r\ncombination with another portion of the chlorine, so that in the end the\r\nchlorine is combined with both the hydrogen and the carbon.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] It is possible to imagine that the cause of a great many of such\r\n       reactions is, that substances taken in a separate state, for\r\n       instance, charcoal, present a complex molecule composed of\r\n       separate atoms of carbon which are fastened together (united, as\r\n       is usually said) by a considerable affinity; for atoms of the\r\n       same kind, just like atoms of different kinds, possess a mutual\r\n       affinity. The affinity of chlorine for carbon, although unable\r\n       to break this bond asunder, may be sufficient to form a stable\r\n       compound with atoms of carbon, which are already separate. Such\r\n       a view of the subject presents a hypothesis which, although\r\n       dominant at the present time, is without sufficiently firm\r\n       foundation. It is evident, however, that not only does chemical\r\n       reaction itself consist of motions, but that in the compound\r\n       formed (in the molecules) the elements (atoms) forming it are in\r\n       harmonious stable motion (like the planets in the solar system),\r\n       and this motion will affect the stability and capacity for\r\n       reaction, and therefore the mechanical side of chemical action\r\n       must be exceedingly complex. Just as there are solid, physically\r\n       constant non-volatile substances like rock, gold, charcoal,\r\n       &c., so are there stable and chemically constant bodies; while\r\n       corresponding to physically volatile substances there are bodies\r\n       like camphor, which are chemically unstable and variable.\r\n\r\nAs regards those phenomena which accompany chemical action, the most\r\nimportant circumstance in reference to chemical mechanics is that not\r\nonly do chemical processes produce a mechanical displacement (a motion\r\nof particles), heat, light, electrical potential and current; but that\r\nall these agents are themselves capable of changing and governing\r\nchemical transformations. This reciprocity or reversibility naturally\r\ndepends on the fact that all the phenomena of nature are only different\r\nkinds and forms of visible and invisible (molecular) motions. First\r\nsound, and then light, was shown to consist of vibratory motions, as\r\nthe laws of physics have proved and developed beyond a doubt. The\r\nconnection between heat and mechanical motion and work has ceased to\r\nbe a supposition, but has become an accepted fact, and the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat (425 kilogrammetres of mechanical work correspond\r\nwith one kilogram unit of heat or Calorie) gives a mechanical measure\r\nfor thermal phenomena. Although the mechanical theory of electrical\r\nphenomena cannot be considered so fully developed as the theory of heat,\r\nboth statical and dynamical electricity are produced by mechanical\r\nmeans (in common electrical machines or in Gramme or other dynamos),\r\nand conversely, a current (in electric motors) can produce mechanical\r\nmotion. Thus by connecting a current with the poles of a Gramme dynamo\r\nit may be made to revolve, and, conversely, by rotating it an electrical\r\ncurrent is produced, which demonstrates the reversibility of electricity\r\ninto mechanical motion. Accordingly chemical mechanics must look for\r\nthe fundamental lines of its advancement in the correlation of chemical\r\nwith physical and mechanical phenomena. But this subject, owing to its\r\ncomplexity and comparative novelty, has not yet been expressed by a\r\nharmonious theory, or even by a satisfactory hypothesis, and therefore\r\nwe shall avoid lingering over it.\r\n\r\nA chemical change in a certain direction is accomplished not only by\r\nreason of the difference of masses, the composition of the substances\r\nconcerned, the distribution of their parts, and their affinity or\r\nchemical energy, but also by reason of the _conditions_ under which the\r\nsubstances occur. In order that a certain chemical reaction may take\r\nplace between substances which are capable of reacting on each other, it\r\nis often necessary to have recourse to conditions which are sometimes\r\nvery different from those in which the substances usually occur in\r\nnature. For example, not only is the presence of air (oxygen) necessary\r\nfor the combustion of charcoal, but the latter must also be heated to\r\nredness. The red-hot portion of the charcoal burns--_i.e._ combines with\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere--and in so doing evolves heat, which raises\r\nthe temperature of the adjacent parts of charcoal, so that they burn.\r\nJust as the combustion of charcoal is dependent on its being heated\r\nto redness, so also every chemical reaction only takes place under\r\ncertain physical, mechanical, or other conditions. The following are the\r\nchief conditions which exert an influence on the progress of chemical\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Temperature._--Chemical reactions of combination only take\r\nplace within certain definite limits of temperature, and cannot be\r\naccomplished outside these limits. We may cite as examples not only\r\nthat the combustion of charcoal begins at a red heat, but also that\r\nchlorine and salt only combine with water at a temperature below 0°.\r\nThese compounds cannot be formed at a higher temperature, for they are\r\nthen wholly or partially broken up into their component parts. A certain\r\nrise in temperature is necessary to start combustion. In certain cases\r\nthe effect of this rise may be explained as causing one of the reacting\r\nbodies to change from a solid into a liquid or gaseous form. The\r\ntransference into a fluid form facilitates the progress of the reaction,\r\nbecause it aids the intimate contact of the particles reacting on\r\neach other. Another reason, and to this must be ascribed the chief\r\ninfluence of heat in exciting chemical action, is that the physical\r\ncohesion, or the internal chemical union, of homogeneous particles is\r\nthereby weakened, and in this way the separation of the particles of\r\nthe original substances, and their transference into new compounds, is\r\nrendered easier. When a reaction absorbs heat--as in decomposition--the\r\nreason why heat is necessary is self-evident.\r\n\r\nAt the present day it may be asserted upon the basis of existing data,\r\nrespecting the action of high temperature, that all compound bodies are\r\ndecomposed at a more or less high temperature. We have already seen\r\nexamples of this in describing the decomposition of mercury oxide into\r\nmercury and oxygen, and the decomposition of wood under the influence\r\nof heat. Many substances are decomposed at a very moderate temperature;\r\nfor instance, the fulminating salt which is employed in cartridges is\r\ndecomposed at a little above 120°. The majority of those compounds\r\nwhich make up the mass of animal and vegetable tissues are decomposed\r\nat 200°. On the other hand, there is reason to think that at a very\r\nlow temperature no reaction whatever can take place. Thus plants cease\r\nto carry on their chemical processes during the winter. Raoul Pictet\r\n(1892), employing the very low temperatures (as low as -200°C.) obtained\r\nby the evaporation of liquefied gases (_see_ Chap. II.), has recently\r\nagain proved that at temperatures below -120°, even such reactions as\r\nthose between sulphuric acid and caustic soda or metallic sodium do not\r\ntake place, and even the coloration of litmus by acids only commences\r\nat temperatures above -80°. If a given reaction does not take place at\r\na certain low temperature, it will at first only proceed slowly with\r\na rise of temperature (even if aided by an electric discharge), and\r\nwill only proceed rapidly, with the evolution of heat, when a certain\r\ndefinite temperature has been reached. Every chemical reaction requires\r\ncertain limits of temperature for its accomplishment, and, doubtless,\r\nmany of the chemical changes observed by us cannot take place in the\r\nsun, where the temperature is very high, or on the moon, where it is\r\nvery low.\r\n\r\nThe influence of heat on reversible reactions is particularly\r\ninstructive. If, for instance, a compound which is capable of being\r\nreproduced from its products of decomposition be heated up to the\r\ntemperature at which decomposition begins, the decomposition of a mass\r\nof the substance contained in a definite volume is not immediately\r\ncompleted. Only a certain fraction of the substance is decomposed, the\r\nother portion remaining unchanged, and if the temperature be raised, the\r\nquantity of the substance decomposed increases; furthermore, for a given\r\nvolume, the ratio between the part decomposed and the part unaltered\r\ncorresponds with each definite rise in temperature until it reaches that\r\nat which the compound is entirely decomposed. This partial decomposition\r\nunder the influence of heat is called _dissociation_. It is possible\r\nto distinguish between the temperatures at which dissociation begins\r\nand ends. Should dissociation proceed at a certain temperature, yet\r\nshould the product or products of decomposition not remain in contact\r\nwith the still undecomposed portion of the compound, then decomposition\r\nwill go on to the end. Thus limestone is decomposed in a limekiln\r\ninto lime and carbonic anhydride, because the latter is carried off\r\nby the draught of the furnace. But if a certain mass of limestone be\r\nenclosed in a definite volume--for instance, in a gun barrel--which is\r\nthen sealed up, and heated to redness, then, as the carbonic anhydride\r\ncannot escape, a certain proportion only of the limestone will be\r\ndecomposed for every increment of heat (rise in temperature) higher\r\nthan that at which dissociation begins. Decomposition will cease\r\nwhen the carbonic anhydride evolved presents a maximum _dissociation\r\npressure_ corresponding with each rise in temperature. If the pressure\r\nbe increased by increasing the quantity of gas, then combination begins\r\nafresh; if the pressure be diminished decomposition will recommence.\r\nDecomposition in this case is exactly similar to evaporation; if the\r\nsteam given off by evaporation cannot escape, its pressure will reach a\r\nmaximum corresponding with the given temperature, and then evaporation\r\nwill cease. Should steam be added it will be condensed in the liquid;\r\nif its quantity be diminished--_i.e._ if the pressure be lessened,\r\nthe temperature being constant--then evaporation will go on. We shall\r\nafterwards discuss more fully these phenomena of dissociation, which\r\nwere first discovered by Henri St. Claire Deville. We will only remark\r\nthat the products of decomposition re-combine with greater facility the\r\nnearer their temperature is to that at which dissociation begins, or, in\r\nother words, that the initial temperature of dissociation is near to the\r\ninitial temperature of combination.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The influence of an electric current_, and of electricity in\r\ngeneral, on the progress of chemical transformations is very similar\r\nto the influence of heat. The majority of compounds which conduct\r\nelectricity are decomposed by the action of a galvanic current, and as\r\nthere is great similarity in the conditions under which decomposition\r\nand combination proceed, combination often proceeds under the influence\r\nof electricity. Electricity, like heat, must be regarded as a peculiar\r\nform of molecular motion, and all that refers to the influence of heat\r\nalso refers to the phenomena produced by the action of an electrical\r\ncurrent, with this difference, only that a substance can be separated\r\ninto its component parts with much greater ease by electricity, since\r\nthe process goes on at the ordinary temperature. The most stable\r\ncompounds may be decomposed by this means, and a most important fact\r\nis then observed--namely, that the component parts appear at the\r\ndifferent poles of electrodes by which the current passes through the\r\nsubstance. Those substances which appear at the positive pole (anode)\r\nare called 'electro-negative,' and those which appear at the negative\r\npole (cathode, that in connection with the zinc of an ordinary galvanic\r\nbattery) are called 'electro-positive.' The majority of non-metallic\r\nelements, such as chlorine, oxygen, &c., and also acids and substances\r\nanalogous to them, belong to the first group, whilst the metals,\r\nhydrogen, and analogous products of decomposition appear at the negative\r\npole. Chemistry is indebted to the decomposition of compounds by the\r\nelectric current for many most important discoveries. Many elements\r\nhave been discovered by this method, the most important being potassium\r\nand sodium. Lavoisier and the chemists of his time were not able to\r\ndecompose the oxygen compounds of these metals, but Davy showed that\r\nthey might be decomposed by an electric current, the metals sodium and\r\npotassium appearing at the negative pole. Now that the dynamo gives the\r\npossibility of producing an electric current by the combustion of fuel,\r\nthis method of Sir H. Davy is advantageously employed for obtaining\r\nmetals, &c. on a large scale, for instance, sodium from fused caustic\r\nsoda or chlorine from solutions of salt.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Certain unstable compounds are also decomposed by _the action of\r\nlight_. Photography is based on this property in certain substances\r\n(for instance, in the salts of silver). The mechanical energy of those\r\nvibrations which determine the phenomena of light is very small, and\r\ntherefore only certain, and these generally unstable, compounds can be\r\ndecomposed by light--at least under ordinary circumstances. But there is\r\none class of chemical phenomena dependent on the action of light which\r\nforms as yet an unsolved problem in chemistry--these are the processes\r\naccomplished in plants under the influence of light. Here there take\r\nplace most unexpected decompositions and combinations, which are often\r\nunattainable by artificial means. For instance, carbonic anhydride,\r\nwhich is so stable under the influence of heat and electricity, is\r\ndecomposed and evolves oxygen in plants under the influence of light. In\r\nother cases, light decomposes unstable compounds, such as are usually\r\neasily decomposed by heat and other agents. Chlorine combines with\r\nhydrogen under the influence of light, which shows that combination, as\r\nwell as decomposition, can be determined by its action, as was likewise\r\nthe case with heat and electricity.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Mechanical causes_ exert, like the foregoing agents, an action\r\nboth on the process of chemical combination and of decomposition. Many\r\nsubstances are decomposed by friction or by a blow--as, for example,\r\nthe compound called iodide of nitrogen (which is composed of iodine,\r\nnitrogen, and hydrogen), and silver fulminate. Mechanical friction\r\ncauses sulphur to burn at the expense of the oxygen contained in\r\npotassium chlorate. Pressure affects both the physical and chemical\r\nstate of the reacting substances, and, together with the temperature,\r\ndetermines the state of a substance. This is particularly evident when\r\nthe substance occurs in an elastic-gaseous form since the volume, and\r\nhence also the number of points of encounter between the reacting\r\nsubstances is greatly altered by a change of pressure. Thus, under equal\r\nconditions of temperature, hydrogen when compressed acts more powerfully\r\nupon iodine and on the solutions of many salts.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Besides the various conditions which have been enumerated above,\r\nthe progress of chemical reactions is accelerated or retarded by the\r\n_condition of contact_ in which the reacting bodies occur. Other\r\nconditions remaining constant, the rate of progress of a chemical\r\nreaction is accelerated by increasing the number of points of contact.\r\nIt will be enough to point out the fact that sulphuric acid does not\r\nabsorb ethylene under ordinary conditions of contact, but only after\r\ncontinued shaking, by which means the number of points of contact\r\nis greatly increased. To ensure complete action between solids, it\r\nis necessary to reduce them to very fine powder and to mix them as\r\nthoroughly as possible. M. Spring, the Belgian chemist, has shown\r\nthat finely powdered solids which do not react on each other at the\r\nordinary temperature may do so under an increased pressure. Thus, under\r\na pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, sulphur combines with many metals at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, and mixtures of the powders of many metals\r\nform alloys. It is evident that an increase in the number of points\r\nor surfaces must be regarded as the chief cause producing reaction,\r\nwhich is doubtless accomplished in solids, as in liquids and gases, in\r\nvirtue of an internal motion of the particles, which motion, although\r\nin different degrees and forms, must exist in all the states of matter.\r\nIt is very important to direct attention to the fact that the internal\r\nmotion or condition of the parts of the particles of matter must be\r\ndifferent on the surface of a substance from what it is inside; because\r\nin the interior of a substance similar particles are acting on all sides\r\nof every particle, whilst at the surface they act on one side only.\r\nTherefore, the condition of a substance at its surfaces of contact with\r\nother substances must be more or less modified by them--it may be in a\r\nmanner similar to that caused by an elevation of temperature. These\r\nconsiderations throw some light on the action in the large class of\r\n_contact reactions_; that is, such as appear to proceed from the mere\r\npresence (contact) of certain special substances. Porous or powdery\r\nsubstances are very prone to act in this way, especially spongy platinum\r\nand charcoal. For example, sulphurous anhydride does not combine\r\ndirectly with oxygen, but this reaction takes place in the presence of\r\nspongy platinum.[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] Contact phenomena are separately considered in detail in the work\r\n       of Professor Konovaloff (1884). In my opinion, it must be\r\n       held that the state of the internal motions of the atoms in\r\n       molecules is modified at the points of contact of substances,\r\n       and this state determines chemical reactions, and therefore,\r\n       that reactions of combination, decomposition, and rearrangement\r\n       are accomplished by contact. Professor Konovaloff showed that a\r\n       number of substances, under certain conditions of their surfaces,\r\n       act by contact; for instance, finely divided silica (from the\r\n       hydrate) acts just like platinum, decomposing certain compound\r\n       ethers. As reactions are only accomplished under close contact,\r\n       it is probable that those modifications in the distribution of\r\n       the atoms in molecules which come about by contact phenomena\r\n       prepare the way for them. By this the _rôle_ of contact phenomena\r\n       is considerably extended. Such phenomena should explain the fact\r\n       why a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen yields water (explodes) at\r\n       different temperatures, according to the kind of heated substance\r\n       which transmits this temperature. In chemical mechanics,\r\n       phenomena of this kind have great importance, but as yet they\r\n       have been but little studied. It must not be forgotten that\r\n       contact is a necessary condition for every chemical reaction.\r\n\r\nThe above general and introductory chemical conceptions cannot be\r\nthoroughly grasped in their true sense without a knowledge of the\r\nparticular facts of chemistry to which we shall now turn our attention.\r\nIt was, however, absolutely necessary to become acquainted on the\r\nvery threshold with such fundamental principles as the laws of the\r\nindestructibility of matter and of the conservation of energy, since it\r\nis only by their acceptance, and under their direction and influence,\r\nthat the examination of particular facts can give practical and fruitful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                       ON WATER AND ITS COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWater is found almost everywhere in nature, and in all three physical\r\nstates. As vapour, water occurs in the atmosphere, and in this form\r\nit is distributed over the entire surface of the earth. The vapour of\r\nwater in condensing, by cooling, forms snow, rain, hail, dew, and fog.\r\nOne cubic metre (or 1,000,000 cubic centimetres, or 1,000 litres, or\r\n35·316 cubic feet) of air can contain at 0° only 4·8 grams of water, at\r\n20° about 17·0 grams, at 40° about 50·7 grams; but ordinary air only\r\ncontains about 60 per cent. of this maximum. Air containing less than\r\n40 per cent. is felt to be dry, whilst air which contains more than\r\n80 per cent. of the same maximum is considered as distinctly damp.[1]\r\nWater in the liquid state, in falling as rain and snow, soaks into\r\nthe soil and collects together into springs, lakes, rivers, seas, and\r\noceans. It is absorbed from the soil by the roots of plants, which, when\r\nfresh, contain from 40 to 80 per cent. of water by weight. Animals\r\ncontain about the same amount of water. In a solid state, water appears\r\nas snow, ice, or in an intermediate form between these two, which is\r\nseen on mountains covered with perpetual snow. The water of rivers,[2]\r\nsprings, oceans and seas, lakes, and wells contains various substances\r\nin solution mostly salt,--that is, substances resembling common table\r\nsalt in their physical properties and chief chemical transformations.\r\nFurther, the quantity and nature of these salts differ in different\r\nwaters.[3] Everybody knows that there are salt, fresh, iron, and\r\nother waters. The presence of about 3-1/2 per cent. of salts renders\r\nsea-water[4] bitter to the taste and increases its specific gravity.\r\nFresh water also contains salts, but only in a comparatively small\r\nquantity. Their presence may be easily proved by simply evaporating\r\nwater in a vessel. On evaporation the water passes away as vapour,\r\nwhilst the salts are left behind. This is why a crust (incrustation),\r\nconsisting of salts, previously in solution, is deposited on the insides\r\nof kettles or boilers, and other vessels in which water is boiled.\r\nRunning water (rivers, &c.) is charged with salts, owing to its being\r\nformed from the collection of rain water percolating through the soil.\r\nWhile percolating, the water dissolves certain parts of the soil. Thus\r\nwater which filters or passes through saline or calcareous soils becomes\r\ncharged with salts or contains calcium carbonate (chalk). Rain water and\r\nsnow are much purer than river or spring water. Nevertheless, in passing\r\nthrough the atmosphere, rain and snow succeed in catching the dust held\r\nin it, and dissolve air, which is found in every water. The dissolved\r\ngases of the atmosphere are partly disengaged, as bubbles from water on\r\nheating, and water after long boiling is quite freed from them.\r\n\r\n  [1] In practice, the chemist has to continually deal with gases, and\r\n      gases are often collected over water; in which case a certain\r\n      amount of water passes into vapour, and this vapour mixes with\r\n      the gases. It is therefore most important that he should be able\r\n      to calculate the amount of water or of _moisture in air and other\r\n      gases_. Let us imagine a cylinder standing in a mercury bath, and\r\n      filled with a dry gas whose volume equals _v_, temperature _t_°,\r\n      and pressure or tension _h_ mm. (_h_ millimetres of the column\r\n      of mercury at 0°). We will introduce water into the cylinder in\r\n      such a quantity that a small part remains in the liquid state, and\r\n      consequently that the gas will be saturated with aqueous vapour;\r\n      the volume of the gas will then increase (if a larger quantity\r\n      of water be taken some of the gas will he dissolved in it, and\r\n      the volume may therefore he diminished). We will further suppose\r\n      that, after the addition of the water, the temperature remains\r\n      constant; then since the volume increases, the mercury in the\r\n      cylinder falls, and therefore the pressure as well as the volume\r\n      is increased. In order to investigate the phenomenon we will\r\n      artificially increase the pressure, and reduce the volume to the\r\n      original volume _v_. Then the pressure or tension will be greater\r\n      than _h_, namely _h_ + _f_, which means that by the introduction\r\n      of aqueous vapour the pressure of the gas is increased. The\r\n      researches of Dalton, Gay-Lussac, and Regnault showed that this\r\n      increase is equal to the maximum pressure which is proper to\r\n      the aqueous vapour at the temperature at which the observation\r\n      is made. The maximum pressure for all temperatures may be found\r\n      in the tables made from observations on the pressure of aqueous\r\n      vapour. The quantity _f_ will be equal to this maximum pressure\r\n      of aqueous vapour. This may be expressed thus: the maximum\r\n      tension of aqueous vapour (and of all other vapours) saturating\r\n      a space in a vacuum or in any gas is the same. This rule is\r\n      known as _Dalton's law_. Thus we have a volume of dry gas _v_,\r\n      under a pressure _h_, and a volume of moist gas, saturated with\r\n      vapour, under a pressure _h_ + _f_. The volume _v_ of the dry gas\r\n      under a pressure _h_ + _f_ occupies, from Boyle's law, a volume\r\n      _vh_/_h_ + _f_; consequently the volume occupied by the aqueous\r\n      vapour under the pressure _h_ + _f_ equals _v_-_vh_/(_h_ + _f_),\r\n      or _vf_/(_h_ + _f_). Thus the volumes of the dry gas and of the\r\n      moisture which occurs in it, at a pressure _h_ + _f_, are in the\r\n      ratio _f_ : _h_. And, therefore, if the aqueous vapour saturates\r\n      a space at a pressure _n_, the volumes of the dry air and of the\r\n      moisture which is contained in it are in the ratio (_n_-_f_) :\r\n      _f_, where _f_ is the pressure of the vapour according to the\r\n      tables of vapour tension. Thus, if a volume N of a gas saturated\r\n      with moisture be measured at a pressure H, then the volume of\r\n      the gas, when dry, will be equal to N[(H-f)/H]. In fact, the\r\n      entire volume N must be to the volume of dry gas _x_ as H is to\r\n      H-_f_; therefore, N : _x_ = H : H-_f_, from which _x_ = N[(H-f)/H].\r\n      Under any other pressure--for instance, 760 mm.--The volume of\r\n      dry gas will be _x_H/760, or (H-_f_)/760, and we thus obtain\r\n      the following practical rule: If a volume of a gas saturated\r\n      with aqueous vapour be measured at a pressure H mm., then the\r\n      volume of dry gas contained in it will be obtained by finding the\r\n      volume corresponding to the pressure H, less the pressure due\r\n      to the aqueous vapour at the temperature observed. For example,\r\n      37·5 cubic centimetres of air saturated with aqueous vapour were\r\n      measured at a temperature of 15·3°, and under a pressure of 747·3\r\n      mm. of mercury (at 0°). What will be the volume of dry gas at 0°\r\n      and 760 mm.?\r\n\r\n      The pressure of aqueous vapour corresponding to 15·3° is equal to\r\n      12·9 mm., and therefore the volume of dry gas at 15·3° and 747·3\r\n      mm. is equal to 37·5 × (747·3-12·9)/747·3; at 760 mm. it will be\r\n      equal to 37·5 × (734·4/760); and at 0° the volume of dry gas will\r\n      be 37·5 × (734·4/760) × 273/(273 + 15·3) = 34·31 c.c.\r\n\r\n      From this rule may also be calculated what fraction of a volume\r\n      of gas is occupied by moisture under the ordinary pressure at\r\n      different temperatures; for instance, at 30° C. _f_ = 31·5,\r\n      consequently 100 volumes of a moist gas or air, at 760 mm.,\r\n      contain a volume of aqueous vapour 100 × (31·5/760), or 4·110; it\r\n      is also found that at 0° there is contained 0·61 p.c. by volume,\r\n      at 10° 1·21 p.c., at 20° 2·29 p.c., and at 50° up to 12·11 p.c.\r\n      From this it may be judged how great an error might be made in\r\n      the measurement of gases by volume if the moisture were not taken\r\n      into consideration. From this it is also evident how great are\r\n      the variations in volume of the atmosphere when it loses or gains\r\n      aqueous vapour, which again explains a number of atmospheric\r\n      phenomena (winds, variation of pressure, rainfalls, storms, &c.)\r\n\r\n      If a gas is not saturated, then it is indispensable that the\r\n      degree of moisture should be known in order to determine the\r\n      volume of dry gas from the volume of moist gas. The preceding\r\n      ratio gives the maximum quantity of water which can be held in\r\n      a gas, and the degree of moisture shows what fraction of this\r\n      maximum quantity occurs in a given case, when the vapour does\r\n      not saturate the space occupied by the gas. Consequently, if the\r\n      degree of moisture equals 50 p.c.--that is, half the maximum--then\r\n      the volume of dry gas at 760 mm. is equal to the volume of dry\r\n      gas at 760 mm. multiplied by (_h_-0·5_f_)/760, or, in general, by\r\n      (_h_-_rf_)/760 where _r_ is the degree of moisture. Thus, if it\r\n      is required to measure the volume of a moist gas, it must either\r\n      be thoroughly dried or quite saturated with moisture, or else\r\n      the degree of moisture determined. The first and last methods\r\n      are inconvenient, and therefore recourse is usually had to the\r\n      second. For this purpose water is introduced into the cylinder\r\n      holding the gas to be measured; it is left for a certain time so\r\n      that the gas may become saturated, the precaution being taken\r\n      that a portion of the water remains in a liquid state; then the\r\n      volume of the moist gas is determined, from which that of the\r\n      dry gas may be calculated. In order to find the _weight of the\r\n      aqueous vapour_ in a gas it is necessary to know the weight of a\r\n      cubic measure at 0° and 760 mm. Knowing that one cubic centimetre\r\n      of air in these circumstances weighs 0·001293 gram, and that\r\n      the density of aqueous vapour is 0·62, we find that one cubic\r\n      centimetre of aqueous vapour at 0° and 760 mm. weighs 0·0008 gram,\r\n      and at a temperature _t_° and pressure _h_ the weight of one cubic\r\n      centimetre will be 0·0008 × _h_/760 × 273/(273 + _t_). We already\r\n      know that _v_ volumes of a gas at a temperature _t_° pressure _h_\r\n      contain _v_ × _f_/_h_ volumes of aqueous vapour which saturate it,\r\n      therefore the weight of the aqueous vapour held in _v_ volumes of\r\n      a gas will be\r\n\r\n                    _v_ x 0·0008 × _f_/760 × 273/(273 + _t_).\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the weight of water which is contained in one volume\r\n      of a gas depends only on the temperature and not on the pressure.\r\n      This also signifies that evaporation proceeds to the same extent\r\n      in air as in a vacuum, or, in general terms (this is _Dalton's\r\n      law_), vapours and gases diffuse into each other as if into a\r\n      vacuum. In a given space, at a given temperature, a constant\r\n      quantity of vapour enters, whatever be the pressure of the gas\r\n      filling that space.\r\n\r\n      From this it is clear that if the weight of the vapour contained\r\n      in a given volume of a gas be known, it is easy to determine the\r\n      degree of moisture _r_ = _p_/(_v_ × 0·0008) × 760/_t_ × (273 +\r\n      _t_)/273. On the is founded the very exact determination of the\r\n      degree of moisture of air by the weight of water contained in a\r\n      given volume. It is easy to calculate from the preceding formula\r\n      the number of grams of water contained at any pressure in one\r\n      cubic metre or million cubic centimetres of air saturated with\r\n      vapour at various temperatures; for instance, at 30° _f_ = 31·5,\r\n      hence _p_ = 29·84 grams.\r\n\r\n      The laws of Mariotte, Dalton, and Gay-Lussac, which are here\r\n      applied to gases and vapours, are not entirely exact, but are\r\n      approximately true. If they were quite exact, a mixture of several\r\n      liquids, having a certain vapour pressure, would give vapours of\r\n      a very high pressure, which is not the case. In fact the pressure\r\n      of aqueous vapour is slightly less in a gas than in a vacuum,\r\n      and the weight of aqueous vapour held in a gas is slightly less\r\n      than it should be according to Dalton's law, as was shown by the\r\n      experiments of Regnault and others. This means that the tension\r\n      of the vapour is less in air than in a vacuum. The difference\r\n      does not, however, exceed 5 per cent. of the total pressure of\r\n      the vapours. This _decrement in vapour tension_ which occurs in\r\n      the intermixture of vapours and gases, although small, indicates\r\n      that there is then already, so to speak, a beginning of chemical\r\n      change. The essence of the matter is that in this case there\r\n      occurs, as on contact (see preceding footnote), an alteration in\r\n      the motions of the atoms in the molecules, and therefore also a\r\n      change in the motion of the molecules themselves.\r\n\r\n      In the uniform intermixture of air and other gases with aqueous\r\n      vapour, and in the capacity of water to pass into vapour and\r\n      form a uniform mixture with air, we may perceive an instance of\r\n      a physical phenomenon which is analogous to chemical phenomena,\r\n      forming indeed a transition from one class of phenomena to\r\n      the other. Between water and dry air there exists a kind of\r\n      affinity which obliges the water to saturate the air. But such a\r\n      homogeneous mixture is formed (almost) independently of the nature\r\n      of the gas in which evaporation takes place; even in a vacuum\r\n      the phenomenon occurs in exactly the same way as in a gas, and\r\n      therefore it is not the property of the gas, nor its relation to\r\n      water, but the property of the water itself, which compels it to\r\n      evaporate, and therefore in this case chemical affinity is not yet\r\n      operative--at least its action is not clearly pronounced. That it\r\n      does, however, play a certain part is seen from the deviation from\r\n      Dalton's law.\r\n\r\n  [2] In falling through the atmosphere, water dissolves the gases of\r\n      the atmosphere, nitric acid, ammonia, organic compounds, salts\r\n      of sodium, magnesium, and calcium, and mechanically washes\r\n      out a mixture of dust and microbes which are suspended in the\r\n      atmosphere. The amount of these and certain other constituents\r\n      is very variable. Even in the beginning and end of the same\r\n      rainfall a variation which is often very considerable may be\r\n      remarked. Thus, for example, Bunsen found that rain collected\r\n      at the beginning of a shower contained 3·7 grams of ammonia per\r\n      cubic metre, whilst that collected at the end of the same shower\r\n      contained only O·64 gram. The water of the entire shower contained\r\n      an average of 1·47 gram of ammonia per cubic metre. In the course\r\n      of a year rain supplies an acre of ground with as much as 5-1/2\r\n      kilos of nitrogen in a combined form. Marchand found in one cubic\r\n      metre of snow water 15·63, and in one cubic metre of rain water\r\n      10·07, grams of sodium sulphate. Angus Smith showed that after a\r\n      thirty hours' fall at Manchester the rain still contained 34·3\r\n      grams of salts per cubic metre. A considerable amount of organic\r\n      matter, namely 25 grams per cubic metre, has been found in rain\r\n      water. The total amount of solid matter in rain water reaches 50\r\n      grams per cubic metre. Rain water generally contains very little\r\n      carbonic acid, whilst river water contains a considerable quantity\r\n      of it. In considering the nourishment of plants it is necessary\r\n      to keep in view the substances which are carried into the soil by\r\n      rain.\r\n\r\n      _River water_, which is accumulated from springs and sources\r\n      fed by atmospheric water, contains from 50 to 1,600 parts by\r\n      weight of salts in 1,000,000 parts. The amount of solid matter,\r\n      per 1,000,000 parts by weight, contained in the chief rivers is\r\n      as follows:--the Don 124, the Loire 135, the St. Lawrence 170,\r\n      the Rhone 182, the Dnieper 187, the Danube from 117 to 234, the\r\n      Rhine from 158 to 317, the Seine from 190 to 432, the Thames at\r\n      London from 400 to 450, in its upper parts 387, and in its lower\r\n      parts up to 1,617, the Nile 1,580, the Jordan 1,052. The Neva is\r\n      characterised by the remarkably small amount of solid matter it\r\n      contains. From the investigations of Prof. G. K. Trapp, a cubic\r\n      metre of Neva water contains 32 grams of incombustible and 23\r\n      grams of organic matter, or altogether about 55 grams. This is one\r\n      of the purest waters which is known in rivers. The large amount\r\n      of impurities in river water, and especially of organic impurity\r\n      produced by pollution with putrid matter, makes the water of many\r\n      rivers unfit for use.\r\n\r\n      The chief part of the soluble substances in river water consists\r\n      of the calcium salts. 100 parts of the solid residues contain\r\n      the following amounts of calcium carbonate--from the water of\r\n      the Loire 53, from the Thames about 50, the Elbe 55, the Vistula\r\n      65, the Danube 65, the Rhine from 55 to 75, the Seine 75, the\r\n      Rhone from 82 to 94. The Neva contains 40 parts of calcium\r\n      carbonate per 100 parts of saline matter. The considerable amount\r\n      of calcium carbonate which river water contains is very easily\r\n      explained from the fact that water which contains carbonic acid\r\n      in solution easily dissolves calcium carbonate, which occurs all\r\n      over the earth. Besides calcium carbonate and sulphate, river\r\n      water contains magnesium, silica, chlorine, sodium, potassium,\r\n      aluminium, nitric acid, iron and manganese. The presence of salts\r\n      of phosphoric acid has not yet been determined with exactitude\r\n      for all rivers, but the presence of nitrates has been proved with\r\n      certainty in almost all kinds of well-investigated river water.\r\n      The quantity of calcium phosphate does not exceed 0·4 gram in the\r\n      water of the Dnieper, and the Don does not contain more than 5\r\n      grams. The water of the Seine contains about 15 grams of nitrates,\r\n      and that of the Rhone about 8 grams. The amount of ammonia is\r\n      much less; thus in the water of the Rhine about 0·5 gram in June,\r\n      and 0·2 gram in October; the water of the Seine contains the same\r\n      amount. This is less than in rain water. Notwithstanding this\r\n      insignificant quantity, the water of the Rhine alone, which is not\r\n      so very large a river, carries 16,245 kilograms of ammonia into\r\n      the ocean every day. The difference between the amount of ammonia\r\n      in rain and river water depends on the fact that the soil through\r\n      which the rain water passes is able to retain the ammonia. (Soil\r\n      can also absorb many other substances, such as phosphoric acid,\r\n      potassium salts, &c.)\r\n\r\n      The waters of springs, rivers, wells, and in general of those\r\n      localities from which it is taken for drinking purposes, may\r\n      be injurious to health if it contains much organic pollution,\r\n      the more so as in such water the lower organisms (bacteria) may\r\n      rapidly develop, and these organisms often serve as the carriers\r\n      or causes of infectious diseases. For instance, certain pathogenic\r\n      (disease-producing) bacteria are known to produce typhoid, the\r\n      Siberian plague, and cholera. Thanks to the work of Pasteur,\r\n      Metchnikoff, Koch, and many others, this province of research has\r\n      made considerable progress. It is possible to investigate the\r\n      number and properties of the germs in water. In bacteriological\r\n      researches a gelatinous medium in which the germs can develop and\r\n      multiply is prepared with gelatin and water, which has previously\r\n      been heated several times, at intervals, to 100° (it is thus\r\n      rendered sterile--that is to say, all the germs in it are killed).\r\n      The water to be investigated is added to this prepared medium in\r\n      a definite and small quantity (sometimes diluted with sterilised\r\n      water to facilitate the calculation of the number of germs), it\r\n      is protected from dust (which contains germs), and is left at\r\n      rest until whole families of lower organisms are developed from\r\n      each germ. These families (colonies) are visible to the naked eye\r\n      (as spots), they may be counted, and by examining them under the\r\n      microscope and observing the number of organisms they produce,\r\n      their significance may be determined. The majority of bacteria\r\n      are harmless, but there are decidedly pathogenic bacteria, whose\r\n      presence is one of the causes of malady and of the spread of\r\n      certain diseases. The number of bacteria in one cubic centimetre\r\n      of water sometimes attains the immense figures of hundreds of\r\n      thousands and millions. Certain well, spring, and river waters\r\n      contain very few bacteria, and are free from disease-producing\r\n      bacteria under ordinary circumstances. By boiling water, the\r\n      bacteria in it are killed, but the organic matter necessary for\r\n      their nourishment remains in the water. The best kinds of water\r\n      for drinking purposes do not contain more than 300 bacteria in a\r\n      cubic centimetre.\r\n\r\n      The amount of gases dissolved in river water is much more constant\r\n      than that of its solid constituents. One litre, or 1,000 c.c., of\r\n      water contains 40 to 55 c.c. of gas measured at normal temperature\r\n      and pressure. In winter the amount of gas is greater than in\r\n      summer or autumn. Assuming that a litre contains 50 c.c. of\r\n      gases, it may be admitted that these consist, on an average, of\r\n      20 vols. of nitrogen, 20 vols of carbonic anhydride (proceeding\r\n      in all likelihood from the soil and not from the atmosphere), and\r\n      of 10 vols. of oxygen. If the total amount of gases be less, the\r\n      constituent gases are still in about the same proportion; in many\r\n      cases, however, carbonic anhydride predominates. The water of many\r\n      deep and rapid rivers contains less carbonic anhydride, which\r\n      shows their rapid formation from atmospheric water, and that they\r\n      have not succeeded, during a long and slow course, in absorbing a\r\n      greater quantity of carbonic anhydride. Thus, for instance, the\r\n      water of the Rhine, near Strasburg, according to Deville, contains\r\n      8 c.c. of carbonic anhydride, 16 c.c. of nitrogen, and 7 c.c. of\r\n      oxygen per litre. From the researches of Prof. M. R. Kapoustin and\r\n      his pupils, it appears that in determining the quality of a water\r\n      for drinking purposes, it is most important to investigate the\r\n      composition of the dissolved gases, more especially oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [3] _Spring water_ is formed from rain water percolating through the\r\n      soil. Naturally a part of the rain water is evaporated directly\r\n      from the surface of the earth and from the vegetation on it. It\r\n      has been shown that out of 100 parts of water falling on the earth\r\n      only 36 parts flow to the ocean; the remaining 64 are evaporated,\r\n      or percolate far underground. After flowing underground along\r\n      some impervious strata, water comes out at the surface in many\r\n      places as springs, whose temperature is determined by the depth\r\n      from which the water has flowed. Springs penetrating to a great\r\n      depth may become considerably heated, and this is why hot mineral\r\n      springs, with a temperature of up to 30° and higher, are often met\r\n      with. When a spring water contains substances which endow it with\r\n      a peculiar taste, and especially if these substances are such as\r\n      are only found in minute quantities in river and other flowing\r\n      waters, then the spring water is termed a _mineral water_. Many\r\n      such waters are employed for medicinal purposes. Mineral waters\r\n      are classed according to their composition into--(_a_) saline\r\n      waters, which often contain a large amount of common salt; (_b_)\r\n      alkaline waters, which contain sodium carbonate; (_c_) bitter\r\n      waters, which contain magnesia; (_d_) chalybeate waters, which\r\n      hold iron carbonate in solution; (_e_) aërated waters, which are\r\n      rich in carbonic anhydride; (_f_) sulphuretted waters, which\r\n      contain hydrogen sulphide. Sulphuretted waters may be recognised\r\n      by their smell of rotten eggs, and by their giving a black\r\n      precipitate with lead salts, and also by their tarnishing silver\r\n      objects. Aërated waters, which contain an excess of carbonic\r\n      anhydride, effervesce in the air, have a sharp taste, and redden\r\n      litmus paper. Saline waters leave a large residue of soluble\r\n      solid matter on evaporation, and have a salt taste. Chalybeate\r\n      waters have an inky taste, and are coloured black by an infusion\r\n      of galls; on being exposed to the air they usually give a brown\r\n      precipitate. Generally, the character of mineral waters is mixed.\r\n      In the table below the analyses are given of certain mineral\r\n      springs which are valued for their medicinal properties.

This is explained by the fact that\r\n      the waters flowing into the sea supply it with salts, and whilst a\r\n      large quantity of vapour is given off from the surface of the sea,\r\n      the salts remain behind. Even the specific gravity of sea water\r\n      differs considerably from that of pure water. It is generally\r\n      about 1·02, but in this and also in respect of the amount of salts\r\n      contained, samples of sea water from different localities and from\r\n      different depths offer rather remarkable variations. It will be\r\n      sufficient to point out that one cubic metre of water from the\r\n      undermentioned localities contains the following quantity in grams\r\n      of solid constituents:--Gulf of Venice, 19,122; Leghorn Harbour\r\n      24,312; Mediterranean, near Cetta, 37,665; the Atlantic Ocean\r\n      from 32,585 to 35,695,; the Pacific Ocean from 35,233 to 34,708.\r\n      In closed seas which do not communicate, or are in very distant\r\n      communication, with the ocean, the difference is often still\r\n      greater. Thus the Caspian Sea contains 6,300 grams; the Black\r\n      Sea and Baltic 17,700. Common salt forms the chief constituent\r\n      of the saline matter of sea or ocean water; thus in one cubic\r\n      metre of sea water there are 25,000-31,000 grams of common salt,\r\n      2,600-6,000 grams of magnesium chloride, 1,200-7,000 grams of\r\n      magnesium sulphate, 1,500-6,000 grams of calcium sulphate, and\r\n      10-700 grams of potassium chloride. The small amount of organic\r\n      matter and of the salts of phosphoric acid in sea water is very\r\n      remarkable. Sea water (the composition of which is partially\r\n      discussed in Chapter X.) contains, in addition to salts of common\r\n      occurrence, a certain and sometimes minute amount of the most\r\n      varied elements, even gold and silver, and as the mass of water of\r\n      the oceans is so enormous these 'traces' of rare substances amount\r\n      to large quantities, so that it may be hoped that in time methods\r\n      will be found to extract even gold from sea water, which by means\r\n      of the rivers forms a vast reservoir for the numerous products\r\n      of the changes taking place on the earth's surface. The works of\r\n      English, American, German, Russian, Swedish, and other navigators\r\n      and observers prove that a study of the composition of sea water\r\n      not only explains much in the history of the earth's life, but\r\n      also gives the possibility (especially since the researches of\r\n      C. O. Makaroff of the St. Petersburg Academy) of fixing one's\r\n      position in the ocean in the absence of other means, for instance,\r\n      in a fog, or in the dark.\r\n\r\nIn general terms water is called pure when it is clear and free from\r\ninsoluble particles held in suspension and visible to the naked eye,\r\nfrom which it may be freed by filtration through charcoal, sand, or\r\nporous (natural or artificial) stones, and when it possesses a clean\r\nfresh taste. It depends on the absence of any taste, decomposing organic\r\nmatter, on the quantity of air[5] and atmospheric gases in solution, and\r\non the presence of mineral substances to the amount of about 300 grams\r\nper ton (or 1000 kilograms per cubic metre, or, what is the same, 300\r\nmilligrams to a kilogram or a litre of water), and of not more than 100\r\ngrams of organic matter.[6] Such water is suitable for drinking and\r\nevery practical application, but evidently it is not pure in a chemical\r\nsense. A _chemically pure water_ is necessary not only for scientific\r\npurposes, as an independent substance having constant and definite\r\nproperties, but also for many practical purposes--for instance, in\r\nphotography and in the preparation of medicines--because many properties\r\nof substances in solution are changed by the impurities of natural\r\nwaters. Water is usually purified by distillation, because the solid\r\nsubstances in solution are not transformed into vapours in this process.\r\nSuch _distilled_ water is prepared by chemists and in laboratories by\r\nboiling water in closed metallic boilers or stills, and causing the\r\nsteam produced to pass into a condenser--that is, through tubes (which\r\nshould be made of tin, or, at all events, tinned, as water and its\r\nimpurities do not act on tin) surrounded by cold water, and in which\r\nthe steam, being cooled, condenses into water which is collected[7] in\r\na receiver. By standing exposed to the atmosphere, however, the water\r\nin time absorbs air, and dust carried in the air. Nevertheless, in\r\ndistillation, water retains, besides air, a certain quantity of volatile\r\nimpurities (especially organic) and the walls of the distillation\r\napparatus are partly corroded by the water, and a portion, although\r\nsmall, of their substance renders the water not entirely pure, and a\r\nresidue is left on evaporation.[8]\r\n\r\n  [5] The taste of water is greatly dependent on the quantity of\r\n      dissolved gases it contains. These gases are given off on\r\n      boiling, and it is well known that, even when cooled, boiled\r\n      water has, until it has absorbed gaseous substances from the\r\n      atmosphere, quite a different taste from fresh water containing\r\n      a considerable amount of gas. The dissolved gases, especially\r\n      oxygen and carbonic anhydride, have an important influence on\r\n      the health. The following instance is very instructive in this\r\n      respect. The Grenelle artesian well at Paris, when first opened,\r\n      supplied a water which had an injurious effect on men and animals.\r\n      It appeared that this water did not contain oxygen, and was in\r\n      general very poor in gases. As soon as it was made to fall in\r\n      a cascade, by which it absorbed air, it proved quite fit for\r\n      consumption. In long sea voyages fresh water is sometimes not\r\n      taken at all, or only taken in a small quantity, because it spoils\r\n      by keeping, and becomes putrid from the organic matter it contains\r\n      undergoing decomposition. Fresh water may he obtained directly\r\n      from sea-water by distillation. The distilled water no longer\r\n      contains sea salts, and is therefore fit for consumption, but\r\n      it is very tasteless and has the properties of boiled water. In\r\n      order to render it palatable certain salts, which are usually held\r\n      in fresh water, are added to it, and it is made to flow in thin\r\n      streams exposed to the air in order that it may become saturated\r\n      with the component parts of the atmosphere--that is, absorb gases.\r\n\r\n  [6] _Hard water_ is such as contains much mineral matter, and\r\n      especially a large proportion of calcium salts. Such water,\r\n      owing to the amount of lime it contains, does not form a lather\r\n      with soap, prevents vegetables boiled in it from softening\r\n      properly, and forms a large amount of incrustation on vessels\r\n      in which it is boiled. When of a high degree of hardness, it\r\n      is injurious for drinking purposes, which is evident from the\r\n      fact that in several large cities the death-rate has been found\r\n      to decrease after introducing a soft water in the place of a\r\n      hard water. _Putrid water_ contains a considerable quantity of\r\n      decomposing organic matter, chiefly vegetable, but in populated\r\n      districts, especially in towns, chiefly animal remains. Such\r\n      water acquires an unpleasant smell and taste, by which stagnant\r\n      bog water and the water of certain wells in inhabited districts\r\n      are particularly characterised. Water of this kind is especially\r\n      injurious at a period of epidemic. It may be partially purified\r\n      by being passed through charcoal, which retains the putrid and\r\n      certain organic substances, and also certain mineral substances.\r\n      Turbid water may be purified to a certain extent by the addition\r\n      of alum, which aids, after standing some time, the formation of\r\n      a sediment. Condy's fluid (potassium permanganate) is another\r\n      means of purifying putrid water. A solution of this substance,\r\n      even if very dilute, is of a red colour; on adding it to a putrid\r\n      water, the permanganate oxidises and destroys the organic matter.\r\n      When added to water in such a quantity as to impart to it an\r\n      almost imperceptible rose colour it destroys much of the organic\r\n      substances it contains. It is especially salutary to add a small\r\n      quantity of Condy's fluid to impure water in times of epidemic.\r\n\r\n      The presence in water of one gram per litre, or 1,000 grams per\r\n      cubic metre, of any substance whatsoever, renders it unfit and\r\n      even injurious for consumption by animals, and this whether\r\n      organic or mineral matter predominates. The presence of 1 p.c. of\r\n      chlorides makes water quite salt, and produces thirst instead of\r\n      assuaging it. The presence of magnesium salts is most unpleasant;\r\n      they have a disagreeable bitter taste, and, in fact, impart to sea\r\n      water its peculiar taste. A large amount of nitrates is only found\r\n      in impure water, and is usually injurious, as they may indicate\r\n      the presence of decomposing organic matter.\r\n\r\n  [7] [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Distillation by means of a metallic still.\r\n      The liquid in C is heated by the fire F.

The steam\r\n      issuing from the retort (on the right-hand side) passes through a\r\n      glass tube surrounded by a larger tube, through which a stream of\r\n      cold water passes, by which the steam is condensed, and runs into\r\n      a receiver (on the left-hand side).\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Distillation from a glass retort. The neck\r\n      of the retort fits into the inner tube of the Liebig's condenser.\r\n      The space between the inner and outer tube of the condenser is\r\n      filled with cold water, which enters by the tube _g_ and flows out\r\n      at _f_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [8] One of Lavoisier's first memoirs (1770) referred to this question.\r\n      He investigated the formation of the earthy residue in the\r\n      distillation of water in order to prove whether it was possible,\r\n      as was affirmed, to convert water into earth, and he found that\r\n      the residue was produced by the action of water on the sides of\r\n      the vessel containing it, and not from the water itself. He proved\r\n      this to be the case by direct weighing.\r\n\r\nFor certain physical and chemical researches, however, it is necessary\r\nto have perfectly pure water. To obtain it, a solution of potassium\r\npermanganate is added to distilled water until the whole is a light\r\nrose colour. By this means the organic matter in the water is destroyed\r\n(converted into gases or non-volatile substances). An excess of\r\npotassium permanganate does no harm, because in the next distillation it\r\nis left behind in the distillation apparatus. The second distillation\r\nshould take place in a platinum retort with a platinum receiver.\r\nPlatinum is a metal which is not acted on either by air or water, and\r\ntherefore nothing passes from it into the water. The water obtained\r\nin the receiver still contains air. It must then be boiled for a long\r\ntime, and afterwards cooled in a vacuum under the receiver of an air\r\npump. Pure water does not leave any residue on evaporation; does not\r\nin the least change, however long it be kept; does not decompose like\r\nwater only once distilled or impure; and it does not give bubbles of\r\ngas on heating, nor does it change the colour of a solution of potassium\r\npermanganate.\r\n\r\nWater, purified as above described, has constant _physical_ and\r\n_chemical properties_. For instance, it is of such water only that\r\none cubic centimetre weighs one gram at 4° C.--_i.e._ it is only such\r\npure water whose specific gravity equals 1 at 4° C.[9] Water in a\r\nsolid state forms crystals of the hexagonal system[10] which are seen\r\nin snow, which generally consists of star-like clusters of several\r\ncrystals, and also in the half-melted scattered ice floating on rivers\r\nin spring time. At this time of the year the ice splits up into spars\r\nor prisms, bounded by angles proper to substances crystallising in the\r\nhexagonal system.\r\n\r\n  [9] Taking the generally-accepted specific gravity of water at its\r\n      greatest density--_i.e._ at 4° as one--it has been shown by\r\n      experiment that the specific gravity of water at different\r\n      temperatures is as follows:\r\n\r\n                   At   0°  0·99987 | At  30°  0·99574\r\n                   \"  +10°  0·99974 | \"   40°  0·99233\r\n                   \"   15°  0·99915 | \"   50°  0·98817\r\n                   \"   20°  0·99827 | \"  100°  0·95859\r\n\r\n      A comparison of all the data at present known shows that the\r\n      variation of the specific gravity S_{t} with the temperature\r\n      _t_ (determined by the mercurial thermometer) maybe expressed\r\n      (Mendeléeff 1891) by the formula\r\n\r\n        S_{t} = 1 - (_t_-4)^{2}/(94·1 + _t_) (703·51-_t_) 1·9\r\n\r\n      +-----------+-------------+---------------------------+-----------+\r\n      |   t° C.   |             | Variation of sp. gr. with |           |\r\n      | according |Sp. gr.

Thus Chappuis\r\n      (1892) obtained 0·998233 for 20°. Water at 4° is taken as the\r\n      basis for reducing measures of length to measures of weight and\r\n      volume. The _metric, decimal, system_ of measures of weights and\r\n      volumes is generally employed in science. The starting point of\r\n      this system is the metre (39·37 inches) divided into decimetres\r\n      (= 0·1 metre), centimetres (= 0·01 metre), millimetres (= 0·001\r\n      metre), and micrometres (= one millionth of a metre). A cubic\r\n      decimetre is called a _litre_, and is used for the measurement\r\n      of volumes. The weight of a litre of water at 4° in a vacuum is\r\n      called a kilogram. One thousandth part of a kilogram of water\r\n      weighs one _gram_. It is divided into decigrams, centigrams,\r\n      and milligrams (= 0·001 gram). An English pound equals 453·59\r\n      grams. The great advantage of this system is that it is a decimal\r\n      one, and that it is universally adopted in science and in most\r\n      international relations. _All the measures cited in this work are\r\n      metrical._ The units most often used in science are:--Of length,\r\n      the centimetre; of weight, the gram; of time, the second; of\r\n      temperature, the degree Celsius or Centigrade. According to the\r\n      most trustworthy determinations (Kupfer in Russia 1841, and Chaney\r\n      in England 1892), the weight of a c. dcm. of water at 4° in vacuo\r\n      is about 999·9 grms. For ordinary purposes the weight of a c.\r\n      dcg. may be taken as equal to a kg. Hence the litre (determined\r\n      by the weight of water it holds) is slightly greater than a cubic\r\n      decimetre.\r\n\r\n  [10] As solid substances appear in independent, regular, crystalline\r\n       forms which are dependent, judging from their cleavage or\r\n       lamination (in virtue of which mica breaks, up into laminae,\r\n       and Iceland spar, &c., into pieces bounded by faces inclined to\r\n       each other at angles which are definite for each substance), on\r\n       an inequality of attraction (cohesion, hardness) in different\r\n       directions which intersect at definite angles the determination\r\n       of crystalline form therefore affords one of the most important\r\n       characteristics for identifying definite chemical compounds. The\r\n       elements of crystallography which comprise a special science\r\n       should therefore he familiar to all who desire to work in\r\n       scientific chemistry. In this work we shall only have occasion\r\n       to speak of a few crystalline forms, some of which are shown in\r\n       figs. 6 to 12.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Example of the form belonging to the\r\n       regular system.

Albite, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe temperatures at which water passes from one state to another are\r\ntaken as fixed points on the thermometer scale; namely, the zero\r\ncorresponds with the temperature of melting ice, and the temperature\r\nof the steam disengaged from water boiling at the normal barometric\r\npressure (that is 760 millimetres measured at 0°, at the latitude of\r\n45°, at the sea level) is taken as 100° of the Celsius scale. Thus, the\r\nfact that water liquefies at 0° and boils at 100° is taken as one of\r\nits properties as a definite chemical compound. The weight of a litre\r\nof water at 4° is 1,000 grams, at 0° it is 999·8 grams. The weight of a\r\nlitre of ice at 0° is less--namely, 917 grams; the weight of the same\r\ncubic measure of water vapour at 760 mm. pressure and 100° is only 0·60\r\ngram; the density of the vapour compared with air = 0·62, and compared\r\nwith hydrogen = 9.\r\n\r\nThese data briefly characterise the physical properties of water as a\r\nseparate substance. To this may be added that water is a mobile liquid,\r\ncolourless, transparent, without taste or smell, &c. Its latent heat\r\nof vaporisation is 534 units, of liquefaction 79 units of heat.[11]\r\nThe large amount of heat stored up in water vapour and also in liquid\r\nwater (for its specific heat is greater than that of other liquids)\r\nrenders it available in both forms for heating purposes. The chemical\r\nreactions which water undergoes, and by means of which it is formed,\r\nare so numerous, and so closely allied to the reactions of many other\r\nsubstances, that it is impossible to describe the majority of them at\r\nthis early stage of chemical exposition. We shall become acquainted\r\nwith many of them afterwards, but at present we shall only cite certain\r\ncompounds formed by water. In order to see clearly the nature of the\r\nvarious kinds of compounds formed by water we will begin with the most\r\nfeeble, which are determined by purely mechanical superficial properties\r\nof the reacting substances.[12]\r\n\r\n  [11] Of all known liquids, water exhibits the greatest _cohesion_ of\r\n       particles. Indeed, it ascends to a greater height in capillary\r\n       tubes than other liquids; for instance, two and a half times as\r\n       high as alcohol, nearly three times as high as ether, and to a\r\n       much greater height than oil of vitriol, &c. In a tube one mm. in\r\n       diameter, water at 0° ascends 15·3 mm., measuring from the height\r\n       of the liquid to two-thirds of the height of the meniscus, and at\r\n       100° it rises 12·5 mm. The cohesion varies very uniformly with\r\n       the temperature; thus at 50° the height of the capillary column\r\n       equals 13·9 mm.--that is, the mean between the columns at 0°\r\n       and 100°. This uniformity is not destroyed even at temperatures\r\n       near the freezing point, and hence it may be assumed that at\r\n       high temperatures cohesion will vary as uniformly as at ordinary\r\n       temperatures; that is, the difference between the columns at 0°\r\n       and 100° being 2·8 mm., the height of the column at 500° should\r\n       be 15·2-(5 × 2·8) = 1·2 mm.; or, in other words, at these high\r\n       temperatures the cohesion between the particles of water would he\r\n       almost _nil_. Only certain solutions (sal ammoniac and lithium\r\n       chloride), and these only with a great excess of water, rise\r\n       higher than pure water in capillary tubes. The great cohesion of\r\n       water doubtless determines many of both its physical and chemical\r\n       properties.\r\n\r\n       The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one\r\n       part by weight of water from 0° to 1°, _i.e._ by 1° C., is called\r\n       the _unit of heat_ or calorie; the _specific heat of liquid\r\n       water_ at 0° is taken as equal to unity. The variation of this\r\n       specific heat with a rise in temperature is inconsiderable in\r\n       comparison with the variation exhibited by the specific heats of\r\n       other liquids. According to Ettinger, the specific heat of water\r\n       at 20° = 1·016, at 50° = 1·039, and at 100° = 1·073. The specific\r\n       heat of water is greater than that of any other known liquid;\r\n       for example, the specific heat of alcohol at 0° is 0·55--_i.e._\r\n       the quantity of heat which raises 55 parts of water 1° raises\r\n       100 parts of alcohol 1°. The specific heat of oil of turpentine\r\n       at 0° is 0·41, of ether 0·53, of acetic acid 0·5274, of mercury\r\n       0·033. Hence water is the best condenser or absorber of heat.\r\n       This property of water has an important significance in practice\r\n       and in nature. Water prevents rapid cooling or heating, and thus\r\n       tempers cold and heat. The specific heats of ice and aqueous\r\n       vapour are much less than that of water; namely, that of ice is\r\n       0·504, and of steam 0·48.\r\n\r\n       With an increase in pressure equal to one atmosphere, the\r\n       compressibility of water (_see_ Note 9) is 0·000047, of mercury\r\n       0·00000352, of ether 0·00012 at 0°, of alcohol at 13° 0·000095.\r\n       The addition of various substances to water generally decreases\r\n       both its compressibility and cohesion. The compressibility of\r\n       other liquids increases with a rise of temperature, but for water\r\n       it decreases up to 53° and then increases like other liquids.\r\n\r\n       The _expansion of water_ by heat (Note 9) also exhibits many\r\n       peculiarities which are not found in other liquids. The expansion\r\n       of water at low temperatures is very small compared with other\r\n       liquids; at 4° it is almost zero, and at 100° it is equal to\r\n       0·0008; below 4° it is negative--_i.e._ water on cooling then\r\n       expands, and does not decrease in volume. In passing into a solid\r\n       state, the specific gravity of water decreases; at 0° one c.c.\r\n       of water weighs 0·999887 gram, and one c.c. of ice at the same\r\n       temperature weighs only 0·9175 gram. The ice formed, however,\r\n       contracts on cooling like the majority of other substances. Thus\r\n       100 volumes of ice are produced from 92 volumes of water--that\r\n       is, water expands considerably on freezing, which fact determines\r\n       a number of natural phenomena. The freezing point of water falls\r\n       with an increase in pressure (0·007° per atmosphere), because in\r\n       freezing water expands (Thomson), whilst with substances which\r\n       contract in solidifying the melting point rises with an increase\r\n       in pressure; thus, paraffin under one atmosphere melts at 46°,\r\n       and under 100 atmospheres at 49°.\r\n\r\n       When liquid water passes into vapour, the cohesion of its\r\n       particles must be destroyed, as the particles are removed to\r\n       such a distance from each other that their mutual attraction\r\n       no longer exhibits any influence. As the cohesion of aqueous\r\n       particles varies at different temperatures, the quantity of heat\r\n       which is expended in overcoming this cohesion--or the _latent\r\n       heat of evaporation_--will for this reason alone be different at\r\n       different temperatures. The quantity of heat which is consumed in\r\n       the transformation of one part by weight of water, at different\r\n       temperatures, into vapour was determined by Regnault with great\r\n       accuracy. His researches showed that one part by weight of water\r\n       at 0°, in passing into vapour having a temperature _t_°, consumes\r\n       606·5 + 0·305_t_ units of heat, at 50° 621·7, at 100° 637·0, at\r\n       150° 652·2, and at 200° 667·5. But this quantity includes also\r\n       the quantity of heat required for heating the water from 0° to\r\n       _t_°--_i.e._ besides the latent heat of evaporation, also that\r\n       heat which is used in heating the water in a liquid state to a\r\n       temperature _t_°. On deducting this amount of heat, we obtain the\r\n       latent heat of evaporation of water as 606·5 at 0°, 571 at 50°,\r\n       534 at 100°, 494 at 150°, and only 453 at 200°, which shows that\r\n       the conversion of water at different temperatures into vapour\r\n       at a constant temperature requires very different quantities of\r\n       heat. This is chiefly dependent on the difference of the cohesion\r\n       of water at different temperatures; the cohesion is greater at\r\n       low than at high temperatures, and therefore at low temperatures\r\n       a greater quantity of heat is required to overcome the cohesion.\r\n       On comparing these quantities of heat, it will be observed that\r\n       they decrease rather uniformly, namely their difference between\r\n       0° and 100° is 72, and between 100° and 200° is 81 units of\r\n       heat. From this we may conclude that this variation will be\r\n       approximately the same for high temperatures also, and therefore\r\n       that no heat would be required for the conversion of water into\r\n       vapour at a temperature of about 400°. At this temperature, water\r\n       passes into vapour whatever be the pressure (see Chap. II. The\r\n       absolute boiling point of water, according to Dewar, is 370°,\r\n       the critical pressure 196 atmospheres). It must here be remarked\r\n       that water, in presenting a greater cohesion, requires a larger\r\n       quantity of heat for its conversion into vapour than other\r\n       liquids. Thus alcohol consumes 208, ether 90, turpentine 70,\r\n       units of heat in their conversion into vapour.\r\n\r\n       The whole amount of heat which is consumed in the conversion of\r\n       water into vapour is not used in overcoming the cohesion--that\r\n       is, in internal accomplished in the liquid. A part of this heat\r\n       is employed in moving the aqueous particles; in fact, aqueous\r\n       vapour at 100° occupies a volume 1,659 times greater than that\r\n       of water (at the ordinary pressure), consequently a portion of\r\n       the heat or work is employed in lifting the aqueous particles, in\r\n       overcoming pressure, or in external work, which may be usefully\r\n       employed, and which is so employed in steam engines. In order\r\n       to determine this work, let us consider the variation of the\r\n       maximum _pressure_ or _vapour tension of steam_ at different\r\n       temperatures. The observations of Regnault in this respect,\r\n       as on those preceding, deserve special attention from their\r\n       comprehensiveness and accuracy. The pressure or tension of\r\n       aqueous vapour at various temperatures is given in the adjoining\r\n       table, and is expressed in millimetres of the barometric column\r\n       reduced to 0°.\r\n\r\n            +------------+---------+-------------+----------+\r\n            |Temperature | Tension | Temperature | Tension  |\r\n            +------------+---------+-------------+----------+\r\n            |   -20°     |    0·9  |     70°     |   233·3  |\r\n            |   -10°     |    2·1  |     90°     |   525·4  |\r\n            |     0°     |    4·6  |    100°     |   760·0  |\r\n            |   +10°     |    9·1  |    105°     |   906·4  |\r\n            |    15°     |   12·7  |    110°     |  1075·4  |\r\n            |    20°     |   17·4  |    115°     |  1269·4  |\r\n            |    25°     |   23·5  |    120°     |  1491·3  |\r\n            |    30°     |   31·5  |    150°     |  3581·0  |\r\n            |    50°     |   92·0  |    200°     | 11689·0  |\r\n            +------------+---------+-------------+----------+\r\n\r\n       The table shows the boiling points of water at different\r\n       pressures. Thus on the summit of Mont Blanc, where the average\r\n       pressure is about 424 mm., water boils at 84·4°. In a rarefied\r\n       atmosphere water boils even at the ordinary temperature, but in\r\n       evaporating it absorbs heat from the neighbouring parts, and\r\n       therefore it becomes cold and may even freeze if the pressure\r\n       does not exceed 4·6 mm., and especially if the vapour be rapidly\r\n       absorbed as it is formed. Oil of vitriol, which absorbs the\r\n       aqueous vapour, is used for this purpose. Thus ice may be\r\n       obtained artificially at the ordinary temperature with the aid\r\n       of an air-pump. This table of the tension of aqueous vapour also\r\n       shows the temperature of water contained in a closed boiler if\r\n       the pressure of the steam formed be known. Thus at a pressure\r\n       of five atmospheres (a pressure of five times the ordinary\r\n       atmospheric pressure--_i.e._ 5 × 760 = 3,800 mm.) the temperature\r\n       of the water would be 152°. The table also shows the pressure\r\n       produced on a given surface by steam on issuing from a boiler.\r\n       Thus steam having a temperature of 152° exerts a pressure of\r\n       517 kilos on a piston whose surface equals 100 sq. cm., for the\r\n       pressure of one atmosphere on one sq. cm. equals 1,033 kilos,\r\n       and steam at 152° has a pressure of five atmospheres. As a\r\n       column of mercury 1 mm. high exerts a pressure of 1·35959 grams\r\n       on a surface of 1 sq. cm., therefore the pressure of aqueous\r\n       vapour at 0° corresponds with a pressure of 6·25 grams per\r\n       square centimetre. The pressures for all temperatures may be\r\n       calculated in a similar way, and it will be found that at 100°\r\n       it is equal to 1,033·28 grams. This means that if a cylinder\r\n       be taken whose sectional area equals 1 sq. cm., and if water\r\n       be poured into it and it be closed by a piston weighing 1,033\r\n       grams, then on heating it in a vacuum to 100° no steam will be\r\n       formed, because the steam cannot overcome the pressure of the\r\n       piston; and if at 100° 534 units of heat be transmitted to each\r\n       unit of weight of water, then the whole of the water will be\r\n       converted into vapour having the same temperature; and so also\r\n       for every other temperature. The question now arises, to what\r\n       height does the piston rise under these circumstances? that is,\r\n       in other words, What is the volume occupied by the steam under\r\n       a known pressure? For this we must know the weight of a cubic\r\n       centimetre of steam at various temperatures. It has been shown by\r\n       experiment that the density of steam, which does not saturate a\r\n       space, varies very inconsiderably at all possible pressures, and\r\n       is nine times the density of hydrogen under similar conditions.\r\n       Steam which saturates a space varies in density at different\r\n       temperatures, but this difference is very small, and its\r\n       average density with reference to air is 0·64. We will employ\r\n       this number in our calculation, and will calculate what volume\r\n       the steam occupies at 100°. One cubic centimetre of air at 0°\r\n       and 760 mm. weighs 0·001293 gram, at 100° and under the same\r\n       pressure it will weigh 0·001293/1·368 or about 0·000946 gram,\r\n       and consequently one cubic centimetre of steam whose density\r\n       is 0·64 will weigh 0·000605 gram at 100°, and therefore one\r\n       gram of aqueous vapour will occupy a volume of about 1·653 c.c.\r\n       Consequently, the piston in the cylinder of 1 sq. cm. sectional\r\n       area, and in which the water occupied a height of 1 cm., will\r\n       be raised 1,653 cm. on the conversion of this water into steam.\r\n       This piston, as has been mentioned, weighs 1,033 grams, therefore\r\n       the _external work of the steam_--that is, that work which the\r\n       water does in its conversion into steam at 100°--is equal to\r\n       lifting a piston weighing 1,033 grams to a height of 1,653 cm.,\r\n       or 17·07 kilogram-metres of work--_i.e._ is capable of lifting\r\n       17 kilograms 1 metre, or 1 kilogram 17 metres. One gram of water\r\n       requires for its conversion into steam 534 gram units of heat or\r\n       0·534 kilogram unit of heat--_i.e._ the quantity of heat absorbed\r\n       in the evaporation of one gram of water is equal to the quantity\r\n       of heat which is capable of heating 1 kilogram of water 0·534°.\r\n       Each unit of heat, as has been shown by accurate experiment,\r\n       is capable of doing 424 kilogram-metres of work. Hence, in\r\n       evaporating, one gram of water expends 424 × 0·534 = (almost) 227\r\n       kilogram-metres of work. The external work was found to be only\r\n       17 kilogram-metres, therefore 210 kilogram-metres are expended in\r\n       overcoming the internal cohesion of the aqueous particles, and\r\n       consequently about 92 p.c. of the total heat or work is consumed\r\n       in overcoming the internal cohesion. The following figures are\r\n       thus calculated approximately:--\r\n\r\n       +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n       |            | Total work of  |External work of |              |\r\n       |Temperature | evaporation in |   vapour in     |   Internal   |\r\n       |            |kilogram-metres |kilogram-metres  |work of vapour|\r\n       +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n       |     0°     |      255       |       13        |     242      |\r\n       |    50°     |      242       |       15        |     227      |\r\n       |   100°     |      226       |       17        |     209      |\r\n       |   150°     |      209       |       19        |     190      |\r\n       |   200°     |      192       |       20        |     172      |\r\n       +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n       The work necessary for overcoming the internal cohesion of\r\n       water in its passage into vapour decreases with the rise in\r\n       temperature--that is, corresponds with the decrease of cohesion;\r\n       and, in fact, the variations which take place in this case are\r\n       very similar to those which are observed in the heights to which\r\n       water rises in capillary tubes at different temperatures. It is\r\n       evident, therefore, that the amount of external--or, as it is\r\n       termed, useful--work which water can supply by its evaporation\r\n       is very small compared with the amount which it expends in its\r\n       conversion into vapour.\r\n\r\n       In considering certain physico-mechanical properties of water, I\r\n       had in view not only their importance for theory and practice,\r\n       but also their purely chemical significance; for it is evident\r\n       from the above considerations that even in a physical change\r\n       of state the greatest part of the work done is employed in\r\n       overcoming cohesion, and that an enormous amount of internal\r\n       energy must be expended in overcoming chemical cohesion or\r\n       affinity.\r\n\r\n  [12] When it is necessary to heat a considerable mass of liquid in\r\n       different vessels, it would be very uneconomical to make use of\r\n       metallic vessels and to construct a separate furnace for each;\r\n       such cases are continually met with in practice. Steam from a\r\n       boiler is introduced into the liquid, or, in general, into the\r\n       vessel which it is required to heat. The steam, in condensing and\r\n       passing into a liquid state, parts with its latent heat, and as\r\n       this is very considerable a small quantity of steam will produce\r\n       a considerable heating effect. If it be required, for instance,\r\n       to heat 1,000 kilos of water from 20° to 50°, which requires\r\n       approximately 30,000 units of heat, steam at 100° is passed into\r\n       the water from a boiler. Each kilogram of water at 50° contains\r\n       about 50 units of heat, and each kilogram of steam at 100°\r\n       contains 637 units of heat; therefore, each kilogram of steam in\r\n       cooling to 50° gives up 587 units of heat, and consequently 52\r\n       kilos of steam are capable of heating 1,000 kilos of water from\r\n       20° to 50°. Water is very often applied for heating in chemical\r\n       practice. For this purpose metallic vessels or pans, called\r\n       'water-baths,' are made use of. They are closed by a cover formed\r\n       of concentric rings lying on each other. The vessels--such as\r\n       beakers, evaporating basins, retorts, &c.--containing liquids,\r\n       are placed on these rings, and the water in the bath is heated.\r\n       The steam given off heats the bottom of the vessels to be heated,\r\n       and thus effects the evaporation or distillation.\r\n\r\nWater is mechanically attracted by many substances; it adheres to their\r\nsurfaces just as dust adheres to objects, or one piece of polished glass\r\nadheres to another. Such attraction is termed 'moistening,' 'soaking,'\r\nor 'absorption of water.' Thus water moistens clean glass and adheres\r\nto its surface, is absorbed by the soil, sand, and clay, and does\r\nnot flow away from them, but lodges itself between their particles.\r\nSimilarly, water soaks into a sponge, cloth, hair, or paper, &c., but\r\nfat and greasy substances in general are not moistened. Attraction\r\nof this kind does not alter the physical or chemical properties of\r\nwater. For instance, under these circumstances water, as is known from\r\neveryday experience, may be expelled from objects by drying. Water\r\nwhich is in any way held mechanically may be dislodged by mechanical\r\nmeans, by friction, pressure, centrifugal force, &c. Thus water is\r\nsqueezed from wet cloth by pressure or centrifugal machines. But objects\r\nwhich in practice are called dry (because they do not feel wet) often\r\nstill contain moisture, as may be proved by heating the object in a\r\nglass tube closed at one end. By placing a piece of paper, dry earth,\r\nor any similar object (especially porous substances) in such a glass\r\ntube, and heating that part of the tube where the object is situated,\r\nit will be remarked that water condenses on the cooler portions of\r\nthe tube. The presence of such absorbed, or 'hygroscopic,' water is\r\ngenerally best detected in non-volatile substances by drying them at\r\n100°, or under the receiver of an air-pump and over substances which\r\nattract water chemically. By weighing a substance before and after\r\ndrying, it is easy to determine the amount of hygroscopic water from\r\nthe loss in weight.[13] Only in this case the amount of water must be\r\njudged with care, because the loss in weight may sometimes proceed\r\nfrom the decomposition of the substance itself, with disengagement of\r\ngases or vapour. In making exact weighings the hygroscopic capacity\r\nof substances--that is, their capacity to absorb moisture--must be\r\ncontinually kept in view, as otherwise the weight will be untrue from\r\nthe presence of moisture. The quantity of moisture absorbed depends on\r\nthe degree of moisture of the atmosphere (that is, on the tension of the\r\naqueous vapour in it) in which a substance is situated. In an entirely\r\ndry atmosphere, or in a vacuum, the hygroscopic water is expelled, being\r\nconverted into vapour; therefore, substances containing hygroscopic\r\nwater may be completely dried by placing them in a dry atmosphere or\r\nin a vacuum. The process is aided by heat, as it increases the tension\r\nof the aqueous vapour. Phosphoric anhydride (a white powder), liquid\r\nsulphuric acid, solid and porous calcium chloride, or the white powder\r\nof ignited copper sulphate, are most generally employed in drying\r\ngases. They absorb the moisture contained in air and all gases to a\r\nconsiderable, but not unlimited, extent. Phosphoric anhydride and\r\ncalcium chloride deliquesce, become damp, sulphuric acid changes from an\r\noily thick liquid into a more mobile liquid, and ignited copper sulphate\r\nbecomes blue; after which changes these substances partly lose their\r\ncapacity of holding water, and can, if it be in excess, even give up\r\ntheir water to the atmosphere. We may remark that the order in which\r\nthese substances are placed above corresponds with the order in which\r\nthey stand in respect to their capacity for absorbing moisture. Air\r\ndried by calcium chloride still contains a certain amount of moisture,\r\nwhich it can give up to sulphuric acid. The most complete desiccation\r\ntakes place with phosphoric anhydride. Water is also removed from\r\nmany substances by placing them in a dish over a vessel containing a\r\nsubstance absorbing water under a glass bell jar.[14] The bell jar,\r\nlike the receiver of an air pump, should be hermetically closed. In this\r\ncase desiccation takes place; because sulphuric acid, for instance,\r\nfirst dries the air in the bell jar by absorbing its moisture, the\r\nsubstance to be dried then parts with its moisture to the dry air,\r\nfrom which it is again absorbed by the sulphuric acid, &c. Desiccation\r\nproceeds still better under the receiver of an air pump, for then the\r\naqueous vapour is formed more quickly than in a bell jar full of air.\r\n\r\n  [13] [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Drying oven, composed of brazed copper.\r\n       It is heated by a lamp. The object to be dried is placed on the\r\n       gauze inside the oven. The thermometer indicates the temperature.]\r\n\r\n       In order to dry any substance at about 100°--that is, at the\r\n       boiling point of water (hygroscopic water passes off at this\r\n       temperature)--an apparatus called a 'drying-oven' is employed.\r\n       It consists of a double copper box; water is poured into the\r\n       space between the internal and external boxes, and the oven is\r\n       then heated over a stove or by any other means, or else steam\r\n       from a boiler is passed between the walls of the two boxes.\r\n       When the water boils, the temperature inside the inner box will\r\n       be approximately 100° C. The substance to be dried is placed\r\n       inside the oven, and the door is closed. Several holes are cut\r\n       in the door to allow the free passage of air, which carries\r\n       off the aqueous vapour by the chimney on the top of the oven.\r\n       Often, however, desiccation is carried on in copper ovens\r\n       heated directly over a lamp (fig. 13). In this case any desired\r\n       temperature may be obtained, which is determined by a thermometer\r\n       fixed in a special orifice. There are substances which only\r\n       part with their water at a much higher temperature than 100°,\r\n       and then such air baths are very useful. In order to determine\r\n       directly the amount of water in a substance which does not part\r\n       with anything except water at a red heat, the substance is placed\r\n       in a bulb tube. By first weighing the tube empty and then with\r\n       the substance to be dried in it, the weight of the substance\r\n       taken may be found. The tube is then connected on one side with\r\n       a gas-holder full of air, which, on opening a stop-cock, passes\r\n       first through a flask containing sulphuric acid, and then into a\r\n       vessel containing lumps of pumice stone moistened with sulphuric\r\n       acid. In passing through these vessels the air is thoroughly\r\n       dried, having given up all its moisture to the sulphuric acid.\r\n       Thus dry air will pass into the bulb tube, and as hygroscopic\r\n       water is entirely given up from a substance in dry air even at\r\n       the ordinary temperature, and still more rapidly on heating,\r\n       the moisture given up by the substance in the tube will be\r\n       carried off by the air passing through it. This damp air then\r\n       passes through a U-shaped tube full of pieces of pumice stone\r\n       moistened with sulphuric acid, which absorbs all the moisture\r\n       given off from the substance in the bulb tube. Thus all the water\r\n       expelled from the substance will collect in the [U] tube, and so,\r\n       if this be weighed before and after, the difference will show the\r\n       quantity of water expelled from the substance. If only water (and\r\n       not any gases) come over, the increase of the weight of the [U]\r\n       tube will be equal to the decrease in the weight of the bulb tube.\r\n\r\n  [14] Instead of under a glass bell jar, drying over sulphuric acid is\r\n       often carried on in a desiccator consisting of a shallow\r\n       wide-mouthed glass vessel, closed by a well-fitting ground-glass\r\n       cover. Sulphuric acid is poured over the bottom of the\r\n       desiccator, and the substance to be dried is placed on a glass\r\n       stand above the acid. A lateral glass tube with a stop-cock is\r\n       often fused into the desiccator in order to connect it with an\r\n       air pump, and so allow drying under a diminished pressure, when\r\n       the moisture evaporates more rapidly. The fact that in the usual\r\n       form of desiccator the desiccating substance (sulphuric acid) is\r\n       placed beneath the substance to be dried has the disadvantage\r\n       that the moist air being lighter than dry air distributes itself\r\n       in the upper portion of the desiccator and not below. Hempel,\r\n       in his desiccator (1891), avoids this by placing the absorbent\r\n       above the substance to be dried. The process of desiccation\r\n       can be further accelerated by cooling the upper portion of the\r\n       desiccator, and so inducing ascending and descending currents of\r\n       air within the apparatus.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above, it is evident that the transference of\r\nmoisture to gases and the absorption of hygroscopic moisture present\r\ngreat resemblance to, but still are not, chemical combinations with\r\nwater. Water, when combined as hygroscopic water, does not lose its\r\nproperties and does not form new substances.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] Chappuis, however, determined that in wetting 1 gram of charcoal\r\n       with water 7 units of heat are evolved, and on pouring carbon\r\n       bisulphide over 1 gram of charcoal as much as 24 units of heat\r\n       are evolved. Alumina (1 gram), when moistened with water, evolves\r\n       2-1/2 calories. This indicates that in respect to evolution of\r\n       heat moistening already presents a transition towards exothermal\r\n       combinations (those evolving heat in their formation).\r\n\r\nThe attraction of water for substances which dissolve in it is of a\r\ndifferent character. In the solution of substances in water there\r\nproceeds a peculiar kind of indefinite combination; a new homogeneous\r\nsubstance is formed from the two substances taken. But here also the\r\nbond connecting the substances is very unstable. Water containing\r\ndifferent substances in solution boils at a temperature near to its\r\nusual boiling point. From the solution of substances which are lighter\r\nthan water itself, there are obtained solutions of a less density than\r\nwater--as, for example, in the solution of alcohol in water; whilst a\r\nheavier substance in dissolving in water gives it a higher specific\r\ngravity. Thus salt water is heavier than fresh.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] Strong acetic acid (C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}), whose specific gravity at\r\n       15° is 1·055, does not become lighter on the addition of water\r\n       (a lighter substance, sp. gr. = 0·999), but heavier, so that a\r\n       solution of 80 parts of acetic acid and 20 parts of water has a\r\n       specific gravity of 1·074, and even a solution of equal parts of\r\n       acetic acid and water (50 p.c.) has a sp. gr. of 1·065, which is\r\n       still greater than that of acetic acid itself. This shows the\r\n       high degree of contraction which takes place on solution. In\r\n       fact, solutions--and, in general, liquids--on mixing with water,\r\n       decrease in volume.\r\n\r\nWe will consider _aqueous solutions_ somewhat fully, because, among\r\nother reasons, solutions are constantly being formed on the earth and\r\nin the waters of the earth, in plants and in animals, in chemical\r\nprocesses and in the arts, and these solutions play an important part\r\nin the chemical transformations which are everywhere taking place,\r\nnot only because water is everywhere met with, but chiefly because a\r\nsubstance in solution presents the most favourable conditions for the\r\nprocess of chemical changes, which require a mobility of parts and a\r\npossible distension of parts. In dissolving, a solid substance acquires\r\na mobility of parts, and a gas loses its elasticity, and therefore\r\nreactions often take place in solutions which do not proceed in the\r\nundissolved substances. Further, a substance, distributed in water,\r\nevidently breaks up--that is, becomes more like a gas and acquires a\r\ngreater mobility of parts. All these considerations require that in\r\ndescribing the properties of substances, particular attention should be\r\npaid to their relation to water as a solvent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Method of transferring a gas into a cylinder\r\nfilled with mercury and whose open end is immersed under the mercury\r\nin a bath having two glass sides. The apparatus containing the gas is\r\nrepresented on the right. Its upper extremity is furnished with a tube\r\nextending under the cylinder. The lower part of the vessel communicates\r\nwith a vertical tube. If mercury be poured into this tube, the pressure\r\nof the gas in the apparatus is increased, and it passes through the\r\ngas-conducting tube into the cylinder, where it displaces the mercury,\r\nand can be measured or subjected to the action of absorbing agents, such\r\nas water.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that water dissolves many substances. Salt, sugar,\r\nalcohol, and a number of other substances, dissolve in water and form\r\nhomogeneous liquids with it. To demonstrate the solubility of gases\r\nin water, a gas should be taken which has a high co-efficient of\r\nsolubility--for instance, ammonia. This is introduced into a bell jar\r\n(or cylinder, as in fig. 14), which is previously filled with mercury\r\nand stands in a mercury bath. If water be then introduced into the\r\ncylinder, the mercury will rise, owing to the water dissolving the\r\nammonia gas. If the column of mercury be less than the barometric\r\ncolumn, and if there be sufficient water to dissolve the gas, all the\r\nammonia will be absorbed by the water. The water is introduced into\r\nthe cylinder by a glass pipette, with a bent end. The bent end is put\r\ninto water, and the air is sucked out from the upper end. When full of\r\nwater, its upper end is closed with the finger, and the bent end placed\r\nin the mercury bath under the orifice of the cylinder. On blowing into\r\nthe pipette the water will rise to the surface of the mercury in the\r\ncylinder owing to its lightness. The solubility of a gas like ammonia\r\nmay be demonstrated by taking a flask full of the gas, and closed\r\nby a cork with a tube passing through it. On placing the tube under\r\nwater, the water will rise into the flask (this may be accelerated by\r\npreviously warming the flask), and begin to play like a fountain inside\r\nit. Both the rising of the mercury and the fountain clearly show the\r\nconsiderable affinity of water for ammonia gas, and the force acting\r\nin this dissolution is rendered evident. A certain period of time is\r\nrequired both for the homogeneous intermixture of gases (diffusion) and\r\nthe process of solution, which depends, not only on the surface of the\r\nparticipating substances, but also on their nature. This is seen from\r\nexperiment. Solutions of different substances heavier than water, such\r\nas salt or sugar, are poured into tall jars. Pure water is then very\r\ncarefully poured into these jars (through a funnel) on to the top of the\r\nsolutions, so as not to disturb the lower stratum, and the jars are then\r\nleft undisturbed. The line of demarcation between the solution and the\r\npure water will be visible, owing to their different co-efficients of\r\nrefraction. Notwithstanding that the solutions taken are heavier than\r\nwater, after some time complete intermixture will ensue. Gay Lussac\r\nconvinced himself of this fact by this particular experiment, which\r\nhe conducted in the cellars under the Paris Astronomical Observatory.\r\nThese cellars are well known as the locality where numerous interesting\r\nresearches have been conducted, because, owing to their depth under\r\nground, they have a uniform temperature during the whole year; the\r\ntemperature does not change during the day, and this was indispensable\r\nfor the experiments on the diffusion of solutions, in order that no\r\ndoubt as to the results should arise from a daily change of temperature\r\n(the experiment lasted several months), which would set up currents in\r\nthe liquids and intermix their strata. Notwithstanding the uniformity\r\nof the temperature, the substance in solution in time ascended into the\r\nwater and distributed itself uniformly through it, proving that there\r\nexists between water and a substance dissolved in it a particular kind\r\nof attraction or striving for mutual interpenetration in opposition to\r\nthe force of gravity. Further, this effort, or rate of diffusion, is\r\ndifferent for salt or sugar or for various other substances.[16 bis] It\r\nfollows therefore that a peculiar force acts in solution, as in actual\r\nchemical combinations, and solution is determined by a particular kind\r\nof motion (by the chemical energy of a substance) which is proper to the\r\nsubstance dissolved and to the solvent.\r\n\r\n  [16 bis] Graham, in the jelly formed by gelatine, and De Vries in\r\n       gelatinous silica (Chapter XVIII.) most frequently employed\r\n       coloured (tinted) substances, for instance, K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7},\r\n       which showed the rate of diffusion with very great clearness.\r\n       Prof. Oumoff employed the method described in Chapter X., Note\r\n       17, for this purpose.\r\n\r\nGraham made a series of experiments similar to those above described,\r\nand showed that the _rate of diffusion_[17] in water is very\r\nvariable--that is, a uniform distribution of a substance in the water\r\ndissolving it is attained in different periods of time with different\r\nsolutions. Graham compared diffusive capacity with volatility. There are\r\nsubstances which diffuse easily, and there are others which diffuse with\r\ndifficulty, just as there are more or less volatile substances. Seven\r\nhundred cubic centimetres of water were poured into a jar, and by means\r\nof a syphon (or a pipette) 100 cub. centimetres of a solution containing\r\n10 grams of a substance were cautiously poured in so as to occupy the\r\nlower portion of the jar. After a lapse of several days, successive\r\nlayers of 50 cubic centimetres were taken from the top downwards, and\r\nthe quantity of substance dissolved in the different layers determined.\r\nThus, common table salt, after fourteen days, gave the following amounts\r\n(in milligrams) in the respective layers, beginning from the top: 104,\r\n120, 126, 198, 267, 340, 429, 535, 654, 766, 881, 991, 1,090, 1,187,\r\nand 2,266 in the remainder; whilst albumin in the same time gave, in\r\nthe first seven layers, a very small amount, and beginning from the\r\neighth layer, 10, 15, 47, 113, 343, 855, 1,892, and in the remainder\r\n6,725 milligrams. Thus, the diffusive power of a solution depends on\r\ntime and on the nature of the substance dissolved, which fact may\r\nserve, not only for explaining the process of solution, but also for\r\ndistinguishing one substance from another. Graham showed that substances\r\nwhich rapidly diffuse through liquids are able to rapidly pass through\r\nmembranes and crystallise, whilst substances which diffuse slowly and do\r\nnot crystallise are _colloids_, that is, resemble glue, and penetrate\r\nthrough a membrane slowly, and form jellies; that is, occur in insoluble\r\nforms,[18] as will be explained in speaking of silica.\r\n\r\n  [17] The researches of Graham, Fick, Nernst, and others showed that\r\n       the quantity of a dissolved substance which is transmitted\r\n       (rises) from one stratum of liquid to another in a vertical\r\n       cylindrical vessel is not only proportional to the time and to\r\n       the sectional area of the cylinder, but also to the amount and\r\n       nature of the substance dissolved in a stratum of liquid, so that\r\n       each substance has its corresponding co-efficient of diffusion.\r\n       The cause of the diffusion of solutions must be considered\r\n       as essentially the same as the cause of the diffusion of\r\n       gases--that is, as dependent on motions which are proper to their\r\n       molecules; but here most probably those purely chemical, although\r\n       feebly-developed, forces, which incline the substances dissolved\r\n       to the formation of definite compounds, also play their part.\r\n\r\n  [18] [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Dialyser. Apparatus for the separation\r\n       of substances which pass through a membrane from those which do\r\n       not. Description in text.]\r\n\r\n       The rate of diffusion--like the rate of transmission--through\r\n       membranes, or _dialysis_ (which plays an important part in the\r\n       vital processes of organisms and also in technical processes),\r\n       presents, according to Graham's researches, a sharply defined\r\n       change in passing from such crystallisable substances as the\r\n       majority of salts and acids to substances which are capable\r\n       of giving jellies (gum, gelatin, &c.) The former diffuse\r\n       into solutions and pass through membranes much more rapidly\r\n       than the latter, and Graham therefore distinguishes between\r\n       _crystalloids_, which diffuse rapidly, and _colloids_, which\r\n       diffuse slowly. On breaking solid colloids into pieces, a total\r\n       absence of cleavage is remarked. The fracture of such substances\r\n       is like that of glue or glass. It is termed a 'conchoidal'\r\n       fracture. Almost all the substances of which animal and vegetable\r\n       bodies consist are colloids, and this is, at all events, partly\r\n       the reason why animals and plants have such varied forms,\r\n       which have no resemblance to the crystalline forms of the\r\n       majority of mineral substances. The colloid solid substances in\r\n       organisms--that is, in animals and plants--almost always contain\r\n       water, and take most peculiar forms, of networks, of granules,\r\n       of hairs, of mucous, shapeless masses, &c., which are quite\r\n       different from the forms taken by crystalline substances. When\r\n       colloids separate out from solutions, or from a molten state,\r\n       they present a form which is similar to that of the liquid from\r\n       which they were formed. Glass may he taken as the best example of\r\n       this. Colloids are distinguishable from crystalloids, not only\r\n       by the absence of crystalline form, but by many other properties\r\n       which admit of clearly distinguishing both these classes of\r\n       solids, as Graham showed. Nearly all colloids are capable of\r\n       passing, under certain circumstances, from a soluble into an\r\n       insoluble state. The best example is shown by white of eggs\r\n       (albumin) in the raw and soluble form, and in the hard-boiled\r\n       and insoluble form. The majority of colloids, on passing into\r\n       an insoluble form in the presence of water, give substances\r\n       having a gelatinous appearance, which is familiar to every one\r\n       in starch, solidified glue, jelly, &c. Thus gelatin, or common\r\n       carpenter's glue, when soaked in water, swells up into an\r\n       insoluble jelly. If this jelly be heated, it melts, and is then\r\n       soluble in water, but on cooling it again forms a jelly which\r\n       is insoluble in water. One of the properties which distinguish\r\n       colloids from crystalloids is that the former pass very slowly\r\n       through a membrane, whilst the latter penetrate very rapidly.\r\n       This may be shown by taking a cylinder, open at both ends, and\r\n       by covering its lower end with a bladder or with vegetable\r\n       parchment (unsized paper immersed for two or three minutes in a\r\n       mixture of sulphuric acid and half its volume of water, and then\r\n       washed), or any other membranous substance (all such substances\r\n       are themselves colloids in an insoluble form). The membrane must\r\n       be firmly tied to the cylinder, so as not to leave any opening.\r\n       Such an apparatus is called a _dialyser_ (fig. 15), and the\r\n       process of separation of crystalloids from colloids by means of\r\n       such a membrane is termed _dialysis_. An aqueous solution of a\r\n       crystalloid or colloid, or a mixture of both, is poured into the\r\n       dialyser, which is then placed in a vessel containing water, so\r\n       that the bottom of the membrane is covered with water. Then,\r\n       after a certain period of time, the crystalloid passes through\r\n       the membrane, whilst the colloid, if it does pass through at all,\r\n       does so at an incomparably slower rate. The crystalloid naturally\r\n       passes through into the water until the solution attains the same\r\n       strength on both sides of the membrane. By replacing the outside\r\n       water with fresh water, a fresh quantity of the crystalloid may\r\n       be separated from the dialyser. While a crystalloid is passing\r\n       through the membrane, a colloid remains almost entirely in the\r\n       dialyser, and therefore a mixed solution of these two kinds of\r\n       substances may be separated from each other by a dialyser. The\r\n       study of the properties of colloids, and of the phenomena of\r\n       their passage through membranes, should elucidate much respecting\r\n       the phenomena which are accomplished in organisms.\r\n\r\nHence, if it be desired to increase the rate of solution, recourse must\r\nbe had to stirring, shaking, or some such mechanical motion. But if once\r\na uniform solution is formed, it will remain uniform, no matter how\r\nheavy the dissolved substance is, or how long the solution be left at\r\nrest, which fact again shows the presence of a force holding together\r\nthe particles of the body dissolved and of the solvent.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] The formation of solutions may be considered in two aspects,\r\n       from a physical and from a chemical point of view, and it is\r\n       more evident in solutions than in any other department of\r\n       chemistry how closely these provinces of natural science are\r\n       allied together. On the one hand solutions form a particular\r\n       case of a physico-mechanical interpenetration of homogeneous\r\n       substances, and a juxtaposition of the molecules of the substance\r\n       dissolved and of the solvent, similar to the juxtaposition which\r\n       is exhibited in homogeneous substances. From this point of view\r\n       this diffusion of solutions is exactly similar to the diffusion\r\n       of gases, with only this difference, that the nature and store of\r\n       energy are different in gases from what they are in liquids, and\r\n       that in liquids there is considerable friction, whilst in gases\r\n       there is comparatively little. The penetration of a dissolved\r\n       substance into water is likened to evaporation, and solution to\r\n       the formation of vapour. This resemblance was clearly expressed\r\n       even by Graham. In recent years the Dutch chemist, Van't Hoff,\r\n       has developed this view of solutions in great detail, having\r\n       shown (in a memoir in the _Transactions of the Swedish Academy\r\n       of Science_, Part 21, No. 17, 'Lois de l'équilibre chimique\r\n       dans l'état dilué, gazeux ou dissous,' 1886), that for dilute\r\n       solutions the _osmotic pressure_ follows the same laws of Boyle,\r\n       Mariotte, Gay-Lussac, and Avogadro-Gerhardt as for gases. The\r\n       osmotic pressure of a substance dissolved in water is determined\r\n       by means of membranes which allow the passage of water, but not\r\n       of a substance dissolved in it, through them. This property is\r\n       found in animal protoplasmic membranes and in porous substances\r\n       covered with an amorphous precipitate, such as is obtained by the\r\n       action of copper sulphate on potassium ferrocyanide (Pfeffer,\r\n       Traube). If, for instance, a one p.c. solution of sugar he placed\r\n       in such a vessel, which is then closed and placed in water, the\r\n       water passes through the walls of the vessel and increases the\r\n       pressure by 50 mm. of the barometric column. If the pressure be\r\n       artificially increased inside the vessel, then the water will be\r\n       expelled through the walls. De Vries found a convenient means\r\n       of determining _isotonic_ solutions (those presenting a similar\r\n       osmotic pressure) in the cells of plants. For this purpose a\r\n       portion of the soft part of the leaves of the _Tradescantis\r\n       discolor_, for instance, is cut away and moistened with the\r\n       solution of a given salt and of a given strength. If the osmotic\r\n       pressure of the solution taken be less than that of the sap\r\n       contained in the cells they will change their form or shrink; if,\r\n       on the other hand, the osmotic pressure be greater than that of\r\n       the sap, then the cells will expand, as can easily be seen under\r\n       the microscope. By altering the amount of the different salts in\r\n       solution it is possible to find for each salt the strength of\r\n       solution at which the cells begin to swell, and at which they\r\n       will consequently have an equal osmotic pressure. As it increases\r\n       in proportion to the amount of a substance dissolved per 100\r\n       parts of water, it is possible, knowing the osmotic pressure\r\n       of a given substance--for instance, sugar at various degrees\r\n       of concentration of solution--and knowing the composition of\r\n       isotonic solutions compared with sugar, to determine the osmotic\r\n       pressure of all the salts investigated. The osmotic pressure of\r\n       dilute solutions determined in this manner directly or indirectly\r\n       (from observations made by Pfeffer and De Vries) was shown to\r\n       follow the same laws as those of the pressure of gases; for\r\n       instance, by doubling or increasing the quantity of a salt (in\r\n       a given volume) _n_ times, the pressure is doubled or increases\r\n       _n_ times. So, for example, in a solution containing one part\r\n       of sugar per 100 parts of water the osmotic pressure (according\r\n       to Pfeffer) = 58·5 cm. of mercury, if 2 parts of sugar = 101·6,\r\n       if 4 parts = 208·2 and so on, which proves that the ratio is\r\n       true within the limits of experimental error. (2) Different\r\n       substances for equal strengths of solutions, show very different\r\n       osmotic pressures, just as gases for equal parts by weight in\r\n       equal volumes show different tensions. (3) If, for a given dilute\r\n       solution at 0°, the osmotic pressure equal _p_°, then at _t_°\r\n       it will be greater and equal to _p_°(1 + 0·00367_t_), _i.e._ it\r\n       increases with the temperature in exactly the same manner as the\r\n       tension of gases increases. (4) If in dilute solutions of such\r\n       substances as do not conduct an electric current (for instance,\r\n       sugar, acetone, and many other organic bodies) the substances\r\n       be taken in the ratio of their molecular weights (expressed by\r\n       their formulæ, see Chapter VII.), then not only will the osmotic\r\n       pressure be equal, but its magnitude will be determined by\r\n       that tension which would be proper to the vapours of the given\r\n       substances when they would be contained in the space occupied by\r\n       the solution, just as the tension of the vapours of molecular\r\n       quantities of the given substances will be equal, and determined\r\n       by the laws of Gay-Lussac, Mariotte, and Avogadro-Gerhardt. Those\r\n       formulæ (Chapter VII., Notes 23 and 24) by which the gaseous\r\n       state of matter is determined, may also be applied in the present\r\n       case. So, for example, the osmotic pressure _p_, in centimetres\r\n       of mercury, of a one per cent. solution of sugar, may be\r\n       calculated according to the formula for gases:\r\n\r\n                       M_p_ = 6200_s_(273 + _t_),\r\n\r\n       where M is the molecular weight, _s_ the weight in grams of a\r\n       cubic centimetre of vapour, and _t_ its temperature. For sugar M\r\n       = 342 (because its molecular composition is C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}).\r\n       The specific gravity of the solution of sugar is 1·003, hence the\r\n       weight of sugar _s_ contained in a 1 per cent. solution = 0·01003\r\n       gram. The observation was made at _t_ = 14°. Hence, according\r\n       to the formula, we find _p_ = 52·2 centimetres. And experiments\r\n       carried on at 14° gave 53·5 centimetres, which is very near to\r\n       the above. (5) For the solutions of salts, acids, and similar\r\n       substances, which conduct an electric current, the calculated\r\n       pressure is usually (but not always in a definite or multiple\r\n       number of times) less than the observed by _i_ times, and this\r\n       _i_ for dilute solutions of MgSO_{4} is nearly 1, for CO_{2} = 1,\r\n       for KCl, NaCl, KI, KNO_{3} greater than 1, and approximates to 2,\r\n       for BaCl_{2}, MgCl_{2}, K_{2}CO_{3}, and others between 2 and 3,\r\n       for HCl, H_{2}SO_{4}, NaNO_{3}, CaN_{2}O_{6}, and others nearly\r\n       2 and so on. It should be remarked that the above deductions are\r\n       only applicable (and with a certain degree of accuracy) to dilute\r\n       solutions, and in this respect resemble the generalisations of\r\n       Michel and Kraft (see Note 44). Nevertheless, the arithmetical\r\n       relation found by Van't Hoff between the formation of vapours\r\n       and the transition into dilute solutions forms an important\r\n       scientific discovery, which should facilitate the explanation of\r\n       the nature of solutions, while the osmotic pressure of solutions\r\n       already forms a very important aspect of the study of solutions.\r\n       In this respect it is necessary to mention that Prof. Konovaloff\r\n       (1891, and subsequently others also) discovered the dependence\r\n       (and it may be a sufficient explanation) of the osmotic pressure\r\n       upon the differences of the tensions of aqueous vapours and\r\n       aqueous solutions; this, however, already enters into a special\r\n       province of physical chemistry (certain data are given in Note\r\n       49 and following), and to this physical side of the question\r\n       also belongs one of the extreme consequences of the resemblance\r\n       of osmotic pressure to gaseous pressure, which is that the\r\n       concentration of a uniform solution varies in parts which are\r\n       heated or cooled. Soret (1881) indeed observed that a solution\r\n       of copper sulphate containing 17 parts of the salt at 20° only\r\n       contained 14 parts after heating the upper portion of the tube\r\n       to 80° for a long period of time. This aspect of solution, which\r\n       is now being very carefully and fully worked out, may be called\r\n       the _physical_ side. Its other aspect is purely _chemical_, for\r\n       solution does not take place between any two substances, but\r\n       requires a special and particular attraction or affinity between\r\n       them. A vapour or gas permeates any other vapour or gas, but a\r\n       salt which dissolves in water may not be in the least soluble\r\n       in alcohol, and is quite insoluble in mercury. In considering\r\n       solutions as a manifestation of chemical force (and of chemical\r\n       energy), it must be acknowledged that they are here developed to\r\n       so feeble an extent that the definite compounds (that is, those\r\n       formed according to the law of multiple proportions) formed\r\n       between water and a soluble substance dissociate even at the\r\n       ordinary temperature, forming a homogeneous system--that is,\r\n       one in which both the compound and the products into which it\r\n       decomposes (water and the aqueous compound) occur in a liquid\r\n       state. The chief difficulty in the comprehension of solutions\r\n       depends on the fact that the mechanical theory of the structure\r\n       of liquids has not yet been so fully developed as the theory of\r\n       gases, and solutions are liquids. The conception of solutions\r\n       as liquid dissociated definite chemical compounds is based on\r\n       the following considerations: (1) that there exist certain\r\n       undoubtedly definite chemical crystallised compounds (such as\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O; or NaCl,2H_{2}O; or CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O; &c.)\r\n       which melt on a certain rise of temperature, and then form true\r\n       solutions; (2) that metallic alloys in a molten condition are\r\n       real solutions, but on cooling they often give entirely distinct\r\n       and definite crystallised compounds, which are recognised by\r\n       the properties of alloys; (3) that between the solvent and the\r\n       substance dissolved there are formed, in a number of cases,\r\n       many undoubtedly definite compounds, such as compounds with\r\n       water of crystallisation; (4) that the physical properties of\r\n       solutions, and especially their specific gravities (a property\r\n       which can be very accurately determined), vary with a change in\r\n       composition, and in such a manner as would be required by the\r\n       formation of one or more definite but dissociating compounds.\r\n       Thus, for example, on adding water to fuming sulphuric acid its\r\n       density is observed to decrease until it attains the definite\r\n       composition H_{2}SO_{4}, or SO_{3} + H_{2}O, when the specific\r\n       gravity increases, although on further diluting with water it\r\n       again falls. Moreover (Mendeléeff, _The Investigation of Aqueous\r\n       Solutions from their Specific Gravities_, 1887), the increase\r\n       in specific gravity (_ds_), varies in all well-known solutions\r\n       with the proportion of the substance dissolved (_dp_), and this\r\n       dependence can be expressed by a formula (_ds_/_dp_ = A + B_p_)\r\n       between the limits of definite compounds whose existence in\r\n       solutions must be admitted, and this is in complete accordance\r\n       with the dissociation hypothesis. Thus, for instance, from\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4} to H_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O (both these substances exist\r\n       as definite compounds in a free state), the fraction _ds_/_dp_\r\n       = 0·0729-0·000749_p_ (where _p_ is the percentage amount of\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4}). For alcohol C_{2}H_{6}O, whose aqueous solutions\r\n       have been more accurately investigated than all others, the\r\n       definite compound C_{2}H_{6}O + 3H_{2}O, and others must be\r\n       acknowledged in its solutions.\r\n\r\n       The two aspects of solution above mentioned, and the hypotheses\r\n       which have as yet been applied to the examination of solutions,\r\n       although they have somewhat different starting points, will\r\n       doubtless in time lead to a general theory of solutions,\r\n       because the same common laws govern both physical and chemical\r\n       phenomena, inasmuch as the properties and motions of molecules,\r\n       which determine physical properties, depend on the motions and\r\n       properties of atoms, which determine chemical reactions. For\r\n       details of the questions dealing with theories of solution,\r\n       recourse must now be had to special memoirs and to works on\r\n       theoretical (physical) chemistry; for this subject forms one of\r\n       special interest at the present epoch of the development of our\r\n       science. In working out chiefly the chemical side of solutions, I\r\n       consider it to be necessary to reconcile the two aspects of the\r\n       question; this seems to me to be all the more possible, as the\r\n       physical side is limited to dilute solutions only, whilst the\r\n       chemical side deals mainly with strong solutions.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the process of solution, besides the conception\r\nof diffusion, another fundamental conception is necessary--namely, that\r\nof the _saturation of solutions_.\r\n\r\nJust as moist air may be diluted with any desired quantity of dry air,\r\nso also an indefinitely large quantity of a liquid solvent may be\r\ntaken, and yet a uniform solution will be obtained. But more than a\r\ndefinite quantity of aqueous vapour cannot be introduced into a certain\r\nvolume of air at a certain temperature. The excess above the point of\r\nsaturation will remain in the liquid state.[20] The relation between\r\nwater and substances dissolved in it is similar. More than a definite\r\nquantity of a substance cannot, at a certain temperature, dissolve in\r\na given quantity of water; the excess does not unite with the water.\r\nJust as air or a gas becomes saturated with vapour, so water becomes\r\nsaturated with a substance dissolved in it. If an excess of a substance\r\nbe added to water which is already saturated with it, it will remain in\r\nits original state, and will not diffuse through the water. The quantity\r\nof a substance (either by volume with gases, or by weight with solids\r\nand liquids) which is capable of saturating 100 parts of water is called\r\nthe _co-efficient of solubility_ or the _solubility_. In 100 grams of\r\nwater at 15°, there can be dissolved not more than 35·86 grams of\r\ncommon salt. Consequently, its solubility at 15° is equal to 35·86.[21]\r\nIt is most important to turn attention to the _existence of the solid\r\ninsoluble substances of nature_, because on them depends the shape\r\nof the substances of the earth's surface, and of plants and animals.\r\nThere is so much water on the earth's surface, that were the surface of\r\nsubstances formed of soluble matters it would constantly change, and\r\nhowever substantial their forms might be, mountains, river banks and sea\r\nshores, plants and animals, or the habitations and coverings of men,\r\ncould not exist for any length of time.[22]\r\n\r\n  [20] A system of (chemically or physically) re-acting substances in\r\n       different states of aggregation--for instance, some solid, others\r\n       liquid or gaseous--is termed a heterogeneous system. Up to now it\r\n       is only systems of this kind which can be subjected to detailed\r\n       examination in the sense of the mechanical theory of matter.\r\n       Solutions (_i.e._ unsaturated ones) form fluid homogeneous\r\n       systems, which at the present time can only be investigated with\r\n       difficulty.\r\n\r\n       In the case of limited solution of liquids in liquids, _the\r\n       difference between the solvent and the substance dissolved_ is\r\n       clearly seen. The former (that is, the solvent) may be added in\r\n       an unlimited quantity, and yet the solution obtained will always\r\n       be uniform, whilst only a definite saturating proportion of the\r\n       substance dissolved can be taken, We will take water and common\r\n       (sulphuric) ether. On shaking the ether with the water, it will\r\n       be remarked that a portion of it dissolves in the water. If the\r\n       ether be taken in such a quantity that it saturates the water\r\n       and a portion of it remains undissolved, then this remaining\r\n       portion will act as a solvent, and water will diffuse through it\r\n       and also form a saturated solution of water in the ether taken.\r\n       Thus two saturated solutions will be obtained. One solution\r\n       will contain ether dissolved in water, and the other solution\r\n       will contain water dissolved in ether. These two solutions will\r\n       arrange themselves in two layers, according to their density;\r\n       the ethereal solution of water will be on the top. If the upper\r\n       ethereal solution be poured off from the aqueous solution,\r\n       any quantity of ether may be added to it; this shows that the\r\n       dissolving substance is ether. If water be added to it, it is\r\n       no longer dissolved in it; this shows that water saturates the\r\n       ether--here water is the substance dissolved. If we act in the\r\n       same manner with the lower layer, we shall find that water is the\r\n       solvent and ether the substance dissolved. By taking different\r\n       amounts of ether and water, the degree of solubility of ether in\r\n       water, and of water in ether, may be easily determined. Water\r\n       approximately dissolves 1/10 of its volume of ether, and ether\r\n       dissolves a very small quantity of water. Let us now imagine that\r\n       the liquid poured in dissolves a considerable amount of water,\r\n       and that water dissolves a considerable amount of the liquid. Two\r\n       layers could not be formed, because the saturated solutions would\r\n       resemble each other, and therefore they would intermix in all\r\n       proportions. This is, consequently, a case of a phenomenon where\r\n       two liquids present considerable co-efficients of solubility\r\n       in each other, but where it is impossible to say what these\r\n       co-efficients are, because it is impossible to obtain a saturated\r\n       solution.\r\n\r\n  [21] The solubility, or co-efficient of solubility, of a substance is\r\n       determined by various methods. Either a solution is expressly\r\n       prepared with a clear excess of the soluble substance and\r\n       saturated at a given temperature, and the quantity of water and\r\n       of the substance dissolved in it determined by evaporation,\r\n       desiccation, or other means; or else, as is done with gases,\r\n       definite quantities of water and of the soluble substance are\r\n       taken and the amount remaining undissolved is determined.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Bunsen's absorptiometer. Apparatus for\r\n       determining the solubility of gases in liquids.]\r\n\r\n       The solubility of a gas in water is determined by means of an\r\n       apparatus called an _absorptiometer_ (fig. 16). It consists of an\r\n       iron stand _f_, on which an india-rubber ring rests. A wide\r\n       glass tube is placed on this ring, and is pressed down on it by\r\n       the ring _h_ and the screws _i i_. The tube is thus firmly fixed\r\n       on the stand. A cock _r_, communicating with a funnel _r_, passes\r\n       into the lower part of the stand. Mercury can be poured into the\r\n       wide tube through this funnel, which is therefore made of steel,\r\n       as copper would be affected by the mercury. The upper ring _h_\r\n       is furnished with a cover _p_, which can be firmly pressed down\r\n       on to the wide tube, and hermetically closes it by means of an\r\n       india-rubber ring. The tube _r r_ can be raised at will, and\r\n       so by pouring mercury into the funnel the height of the column\r\n       of mercury, which produces pressure inside the apparatus, can\r\n       be increased. The pressure can also be diminished at will, by\r\n       letting mercury out through the cock _r_. A graduated tube _e_,\r\n       containing the gas and liquid to be experimented on, is placed\r\n       inside the wide tube. This tube is graduated in millimetres\r\n       for determining the pressure, and it is calibrated for volume,\r\n       so that the number of volumes occupied by the gas and liquid\r\n       dissolving it can be easily calculated. This tube can also be\r\n       easily removed from the apparatus. The lower portion of this\r\n       tube when removed from the apparatus is shown to the right of\r\n       the figure. It will be observed that its lower end is furnished\r\n       with a male screw _b_, fitting in a nut _a_. The lower surface of\r\n       the nut _a_ is covered with india-rubber, so that on screwing up\r\n       the tube its lower end presses upon the india-rubber, and thus\r\n       hermetically closes the whole tube, for its upper end is fused\r\n       up. The nut _a_ is furnished with arms _c c_, and in the stand\r\n       _f_ there are corresponding spaces, so that when the screwed-up\r\n       internal tube is fixed into stand _f_, the arms _c c_ fix into\r\n       these spaces cut in _f_. This enables the internal tube to be\r\n       fixed on to the stand _f_. When the internal tube is fixed in the\r\n       stand, the wide tube is put into its right position, and mercury\r\n       and water are poured into the space between the two tubes, and\r\n       communication is opened between the inside of the tube _e_ and\r\n       the mercury between the interior and exterior tubes. This is done\r\n       by either revolving the interior tube _e_, or by a key turning\r\n       the nut about the bottom part of _f_. The tube _e_ is filled with\r\n       gas and water as follows: the tube is removed from the apparatus,\r\n       filled with mercury, and the gas to be experimented on is passed\r\n       into it. The volume of the gas is measured, the temperature and\r\n       pressure determined, and the volume it would occupy at 0° and\r\n       760 mm. calculated. A known volume of water is then introduced\r\n       into the tube. The water must be previously boiled, so as to be\r\n       quite freed from air in solution. The tube is then closed by\r\n       screwing it down on to the india-rubber on the nut. It is then\r\n       fixed on to the stand _f_, mercury and water are poured into\r\n       the intervening space between it and the exterior tube, which\r\n       is then screwed up and closed by the cover _p_, and the whole\r\n       apparatus is left at rest for some time, so that the tube _e_,\r\n       and the gas in it, may attain the same temperature as that of\r\n       the surrounding water, which is marked by a thermometer _k_\r\n       tied to the tube _e_. The interior tube is then again closed by\r\n       turning it in the nut, the cover _p_ again shut, and the whole\r\n       apparatus is shaken in order that the gas in the tube _e_ may\r\n       entirely saturate the water. After several shakings, the tube\r\n       _e_ is again opened by turning it in the nut, and the apparatus\r\n       is left at rest for a certain time; it is then closed and again\r\n       shaken, and so on until the volume of gas does not diminish after\r\n       a fresh shaking--that is, until saturation ensues. Observations\r\n       are then made of the temperature, the height of the mercury in\r\n       the interior tube, and the level of the water in it, and also\r\n       of the level of the mercury and water in the exterior tube. All\r\n       these data are necessary in order to calculate the pressure under\r\n       which the solution of the gas takes place, and what volume of gas\r\n       remains undissolved, and also the quantity of water which serves\r\n       as the solvent. By varying the temperature of the surrounding\r\n       water, the amount of gas dissolved at various temperatures may\r\n       be determined. Bunsen, Carius, and many others determined the\r\n       solution of various gases in water, alcohol, and certain other\r\n       liquids, by means of this apparatus. If in a determination of\r\n       this kind it is found that _n_ cubic centimetres of water at\r\n       a pressure _h_ dissolve _m_ cubic centimetres of a given gas,\r\n       measured at 0° and 760 mm., when the temperature under which\r\n       solution took place was _t_°, then it follows that at the\r\n       temperature _t the co-efficient of solubility of the gas_ in 1\r\n       volume of the liquid will be equal to _m_/_n_ × 760/_h_.\r\n\r\n       This formula is very clearly understood from the fact that the\r\n       co-efficient of solubility of gases is that quantity measured at\r\n       0° and 760 mm., which is absorbed at a pressure of 760 mm. by one\r\n       volume of a liquid. If _n_ cubic centimetres of water absorb _m_\r\n       cubic centimetres of a gas, then one cubic centimetre absorbs\r\n       _m_/_n_. If _m_/_n_ c.c. of a gas are absorbed under a pressure\r\n       of _h_ mm., then, according to the law of the variation of\r\n       solubility of a gas with the pressure, there would he dissolved,\r\n       under a pressure of 760 mm., a quantity varying in the same ratio\r\n       to _m_/_n_ as 760 : _h_. In determining the residual volume of gas\r\n       its moisture (note 1) must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n       Below are given the number of grams of several substances\r\n       saturating 100 grams of water--that is, their co-efficients of\r\n       solubility by weight at three different temperatures:--\r\n\r\n       +----------------------------------------------+--------+---------+\r\n       |                                              |        |         |\r\n       |                                        At 0° | At 20° | At 100° |\r\n       +----------------------------------------------+--------+---------+\r\n       |        {Oxygen, O_{2}                 6/1000 | 4/1000 |    --   |\r\n       |Gases   {Carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}    35/100 | 18/100 |    --   |\r\n       |        {Ammonia, NH_{3}                 90·0 |   51·8 |    7·3  |\r\n       |        {Phenol, C_{6}H_{6}O              4·9 |    5·2 |   [oo]  |\r\n       |Liquids {Amyl alcohol, C_{5}H_{12}O       4·4 |    2·9 |    --   |\r\n       |        {Sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}     [oo] |   [oo] |   [oo]  |\r\n       |        {Gypsum, CaSO_{4},2H_{2}O         1/5 |    1/4 |    1/5  |\r\n       |        {Alum, AlKS_{2}O_{8},12H_{2}O     3·3 |   15·4 |  357·5  |\r\n       |Solids  {Anhydrous sodium sulphate,       4·5 |   20   |   43    |\r\n       |        {  Na_{2}SO_{4}                       |        |         |\r\n       |        {Common Salt, NaCl               35·7 |   36·0 |   39·7  |\r\n       |        {Nitre, KNO_{3}                  13·3 |   31·7 |  246·0  |\r\n       +----------------------------------------------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\n       Sometimes a substance is so slightly soluble that it may be\r\n       considered as insoluble. Many such substances are met with both\r\n       in solids and liquids, and such a gas as oxygen, although it\r\n       does dissolve, does so in so small a proportion by weight that\r\n       it might be considered as zero did not the solubility of even\r\n       so little oxygen play an important part in nature (as in the\r\n       respiration of fishes) and were not an infinitesimal quantity\r\n       of a gas by weight so easily measured by volume. The sign [oo],\r\n       which stands on a line with sulphuric acid in the above table,\r\n       indicates that it intermixes with water in all proportions.\r\n       There are many such cases among liquids, and everybody knows,\r\n       for instance, that spirit (absolute alcohol) can be mixed in any\r\n       proportion with water.\r\n\r\n  [22] Just as the existence must he admitted of substances which are\r\n       completely undecomposable (chemically) at the ordinary\r\n       temperature--and of substances which are entirely non-volatile\r\n       at such a temperature (as wood and gold), although capable\r\n       of decomposing (wood) or volatilising (gold) at a higher\r\n       temperature--so also the existence must be admitted of substances\r\n       which are totally insoluble in water without some degree of\r\n       change in their state. Although mercury is partially volatile at\r\n       the ordinary temperature, there is no reason to think that it\r\n       and other metals are soluble in water, alcohol, or other similar\r\n       liquids. However, mercury forms solutions, as it dissolves\r\n       other metals. On the other hand, there are many substances\r\n       found in nature which are so very slightly soluble in water,\r\n       that in ordinary practice they may be considered as insoluble\r\n       (for example, barium sulphate). For the comprehension of that\r\n       general plan according to which a change of state of substances\r\n       (combined or dissolved, solid, liquid, or gaseous) takes place,\r\n       it is very important to make a distinction at this boundary\r\n       line (on approaching zero of decomposition, volatility, or\r\n       solubility) between an insignificant amount and zero, but the\r\n       present methods of research and the data at our disposal at the\r\n       present time only just touch such questions (by studying the\r\n       electrical conductivity of dilute solutions and the development\r\n       of micro-organisms in them). It must be remarked, besides, that\r\n       water in a number of cases does not dissolve a substance as\r\n       such, but acts on it chemically and forms a soluble substance.\r\n       Thus glass and many rocks, especially if taken as powder, are\r\n       chemically changed by water, but are not directly soluble in it.\r\n\r\nSubstances which are easily soluble in water bear a certain resemblance\r\nto it. Thus sugar and salt in many of their superficial features remind\r\none of ice. Metals, which are not soluble in water, have no points in\r\ncommon with it, whilst on the other hand they dissolve each other in\r\na molten state, forming alloys, just as oily substances dissolve each\r\nother; for example, tallow is soluble in petroleum and in olive oil,\r\nalthough they are all insoluble in water. From this it is evident that\r\nthe _analogy of substances forming a solution_ plays an important part,\r\nand as aqueous and all other solutions are liquids, there is good reason\r\nto believe that in the process of solution solid and gaseous substances\r\nchange in a physical sense, passing into a liquid state. These\r\nconsiderations elucidate many points of solution--as, for instance, the\r\nvariation of the co-efficient of solubility with the temperature and the\r\nevolution or absorption of heat in the formation of solutions.\r\n\r\nThe solubility--that is, the quantity of a substance necessary for\r\nsaturation--_varies with the temperature_, and, further, with an\r\nincrease in temperature the solubility of solid substances generally\r\nincreases, and that of gases decreases; this might be expected, as solid\r\nsubstances by heating, and gases by cooling, approach to a liquid or\r\ndissolved state.[23] A graphic method is often employed to express the\r\nvariation of solubility with temperature. On the axis of abscissæ or on\r\na horizontal line, temperatures are marked out and perpendiculars are\r\nraised corresponding with each temperature, whose length is determined\r\nby the solubility of the salt at that temperature--expressing, for\r\ninstance, one part by weight of a salt in 100 parts of water by one\r\nunit of length, such as a millimetre. By joining the summits of the\r\nperpendiculars, a curve is obtained which expresses the degree of\r\nsolubility at different temperatures. For solids, the curve is generally\r\nan ascending one--_i.e._ recedes from the horizontal line with the\r\nrise in temperature. These curves clearly show by their inclination\r\nthe degree of rapidity of increase in solubility with the temperature.\r\nHaving determined several points of a curve--that is, having made a\r\ndetermination of the solubility for several temperatures--the solubility\r\nat intermediary temperatures may be determined from the form of the\r\ncurve so obtained; in this way the empirical law of solubility may be\r\nexamined.[24] The results of research have shown that the solubility of\r\ncertain salts--as, for example, common table salt--varies comparatively\r\nlittle with the temperature; whilst for other substances the solubility\r\nincreases by equal amounts for equal increments of temperature. Thus,\r\nfor example, for the saturation of 100 parts of water by potassium\r\nchloride there is required at 0°, 29·2 parts, at 20°, 34·7, at 40°,\r\n40·2, at 60°, 45·7; and so on, for every 10° the solubility increases\r\nby 2·75 parts by weight of the salt. Therefore the solubility of the\r\npotassium chloride in water may be expressed by a direct equation: _a_ =\r\n29·2 + 0·275_t_, where _a_ represents the solubility at _t_°. For other\r\nsalts, more complicated equations are required. For example, for nitre:\r\n_a_ = 13·3 + 0·574_t_ + 0·01717_t_^2 + 0·0000036_t_^3, which shows that\r\nwhen _t_ = 0° _a_ = 13·3, when _t_ = 10° _a_ = 20·8, and when _t_ = 100°\r\n_a_ = 246·0.\r\n\r\n  [23] Beilby (1883) experimented on paraffin, and found that one litre\r\n       of solid paraffin at 21° weighed 874 grams, and when liquid, at\r\n       its melting-point 38°, 783 grams, at 49°, 775 grams, and at 60°,\r\n       767 grams, from which the weight of a litre of liquefied paraffin\r\n       would be 795·4 grams at 21° if it could remain liquid at that\r\n       temperature. By dissolving solid paraffin in lubricating oil at\r\n       21° Beilby found that 795·6 grams occupy one cubic decimetre,\r\n       from which he concluded that the solution contained liquefied\r\n       paraffin.\r\n\r\n  [24] Gay-Lussac was the first to have recourse to such a graphic\r\n       method of expressing solubility, and he considered, in accordance\r\n       with the general opinion, that by joining up the summits of the\r\n       ordinates in one harmonious curve it is possible to express the\r\n       entire change of solubility with the temperature. Now, there are\r\n       many reasons for doubting the accuracy of such an admission, for\r\n       there are undoubtedly critical points in curves of solubility\r\n       (for example, of sodium sulphate, as shown further on), and it\r\n       may be that definite compounds of dissolved substances with\r\n       water, in decomposing within known limits of temperature, give\r\n       critical points more often than would be imagined; it may even\r\n       be, indeed, that instead of a continuous curve, solubility should\r\n       be expressed--if not always, then not unfrequently--by straight\r\n       or broken lines. According to Ditte, the solubility of sodium\r\n       nitrate, NaNO_{3}, is expressed by the following figures per 100\r\n       parts of water:--\r\n\r\n          0°    4°   10°   15°   21°   29°   36°    51°    68°\r\n         66·7  71·0  76·3  80·6  85·7  92·9  99·4  113·6  125·1\r\n\r\n       In my opinion (1881) these data should be expressed with\r\n       exactitude by a straight line, 67·5 + 0·87_t_, which entirely\r\n       agrees with the results of experiment. According to this\r\n       the figure expressing the solubility of salt at 0° exactly\r\n       coincides with the composition of a definite chemical\r\n       compound--NaNO_{3},7H_{2}O. The experiments made by Ditte\r\n       showed that all saturated solutions between 0° and -15·7° have\r\n       such a composition, and that at the latter temperature the\r\n       solution completely solidifies into one homogeneous whole.\r\n       Between 0° and -15·7° the solution NaNO_{3},7H_{2}O does not\r\n       deposit either salt or ice. Thus the solubility of sodium\r\n       nitrate is expressed by a broken straight line. In recent times\r\n       (1888) Étard discovered a similar phenomenon in many of the\r\n       sulphates. Brandes, in 1830, shows a diminution in solubility\r\n       below 100° for manganese sulphate. The percentage by weight\r\n       (_i.e._ per 100 parts of the solution, and not of water) of\r\n       saturation for ferrous sulphate, FeSO_{4}, from -2° to +65° =\r\n       13·5 + 0·3784_t_--that is, the solubility of the salt increases.\r\n       The solubility remains constant from 65° to 98° (according to\r\n       Brandes the solubility then increases; this divergence of opinion\r\n       requires proof), and from 98° to 150° it falls as = 104·35 -\r\n       0·6685_t_. Hence, at about +156° the solubility should = 0, and\r\n       this has been confirmed by experiment. I observe, on my part,\r\n       that Étard's formula gives 38·1 p.c. of salt at 65° and 38·8\r\n       p.c. at 92°, and this maximum amount of salt in the solution\r\n       very nearly corresponds with the composition FeSO_{4},14H_{2}O,\r\n       which requires 37·6 p.c. From what has been said, it is evident\r\n       that the data concerning solubility require a new method of\r\n       investigation, which should have in view the entire scale of\r\n       solubility--from the formation of completely solidified solutions\r\n       (cryohydrates, which we shall speak of presently) to the\r\n       separation of salts from their solutions, if this is accomplished\r\n       at a higher temperature (for manganese and cadmium sulphates\r\n       there is an entire separation, according to Étard), or to the\r\n       formation of a constant solubility (for potassium sulphate the\r\n       solubility, according to Étard, remains constant from 163° to\r\n       220° and equals 24·9 p.c.) (See Chapter XIV., note 50, solubility\r\n       of CaCl_{2}.)\r\n\r\nCurves of solubility give the means of estimating the _amount of salt\r\nseparated_ by the cooling to a known extent of a solution saturated\r\nat a given temperature. For instance, if 200 parts of a solution of\r\npotassium chloride in water saturated at a temperature of 60° be taken,\r\nand it be asked how much of the salt will be separated by cooling the\r\nsolution to 0°, if its solubility at 60° = 45·7 and at 0° = 29·2? The\r\nanswer is obtained in the following manner: At 60° a saturated solution\r\ncontains 45·7 parts of potassium chloride per 100 parts by weight of\r\nwater, consequently 145·7 parts by weight of the solution contain 45·7\r\nparts, or, by proportion, 200 parts by weight of the solution contain\r\n62·7 parts of the salt. The amount of salt remaining in solution at 0°\r\nis calculated as follows; In 200 grams taken there will be 137·3 grams\r\nof water; consequently, this amount of water is capable of holding only\r\n40·1 grams of the salt, and therefore in lowering the temperature from\r\n60° to 0° there should separate from the solution 62·7-40·1 = 22·6 grams\r\nof the dissolved salt.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the solubility of salts, &c., with a rise or fall\r\nof temperature is often taken advantage of, especially in technical\r\nwork, for the separation of salts, in intermixture from each other.\r\nThus a mixture of potassium and sodium chlorides (this mixture is met\r\nwith in nature at Stassfurt) is separated from a saturated solution by\r\nsubjecting it alternately to boiling (evaporation) and cooling. The\r\nsodium chloride separates out in proportion to the amount of water\r\nexpelled from the solution by boiling, and is removed, whilst the\r\npotassium chloride separates out on cooling, as the solubility of this\r\nsalt rapidly decreases with a lowering in temperature. Nitre, sugar, and\r\nmany other soluble substances are purified (refined) in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the majority of cases the solubility of solids increases\r\nwith the temperature, yet there are some solid substances whose\r\nsolubilities decrease on heating. Glauber's salt, or sodium sulphate,\r\nforms a particularly instructive example of the case in question.\r\nIf this salt be taken in an ignited state (deprived of its water of\r\ncrystallisation), then its solubility in 100 parts of water varies with\r\nthe temperature in the following manner: at 0°, 5 parts of the salt\r\nform a saturated solution; at 20°, 20 parts of the salt, at 33° more\r\nthan 50 parts. The solubility, as will be seen, increases with the\r\ntemperature, as is the case with nearly all salts; but starting from 33°\r\nit suddenly diminishes, and at a temperature of 40°, less than 50 parts\r\nof the salt dissolve, at 60° only 45 parts of the salt, and at 100°\r\nabout 43 parts of the salt in 100 parts of water. This phenomenon may\r\nbe traced to the following facts: Firstly, that this salt forms various\r\ncompounds with water, as will be afterwards explained; secondly, that\r\nat 33° the compound Na_{2}SO_{4} + 10H_{2}O formed from the solution\r\nat lower temperatures, melts; and thirdly, that on evaporation at a\r\ntemperature above 33° an anhydrous salt, Na_{2}SO_{4} separates out. It\r\nwill be seen from this example how complicated such an apparently simple\r\nphenomenon as solution really is; and all data concerning solutions lead\r\nto the same conclusion. This complexity becomes evident in investigating\r\nthe _heat of solution_. If solution consisted of a physical change\r\nonly, then in the solution of gases there would be evolved--and in the\r\nsolution of solids, there would be absorbed--just that amount of heat\r\ncorresponding to the change of state; but in reality a large amount of\r\nheat is always evolved in solution, depending on the fact that in the\r\nprocess of solution chemical combination takes place accompanied by an\r\nevolution of heat. Seventeen grams of ammonia (this weight corresponds\r\nwith its formula NH_{3}), in passing from a gaseous into a liquid state,\r\nevolve 4,400 units of heat (latent heat); that is, the quantity of heat\r\nnecessary to raise the temperature of 4,400 grams of water 1°. The\r\nsame quantity of ammonia, in dissolving in an excess of water, evolves\r\ntwice as much heat--namely 8,800 units--showing that the combination\r\nwith water is accompanied by the evolution of 4,400 units of heat.\r\nFurther, the chief part of this heat is separated in dissolving in small\r\nquantities of water, so that 17 grams of ammonia, in dissolving in 18\r\ngrams of water (this weight corresponds with its composition H_{2}O),\r\nevolve 7,535 units of heat, and therefore the formation of the solution\r\nNH_{3} + H_{2}O evolves 3,135 units of heat beyond that due to the\r\nchange of state. As in the solution of gases, the heat of liquefaction\r\n(of physical change of state) and of chemical combination with water\r\nare both positive (+), therefore in the _solution of gases_ in water a\r\n_heat effect_ is always observed. This phenomenon is different in the\r\nsolution of solid substances, because their passage from a solid to a\r\nliquid state is accompanied by an absorption of heat (negative,-heat),\r\nwhilst their chemical combination with water is accompanied by an\r\nevolution of heat (+ heat); consequently, their sum may either be a\r\ncooling effect, when the positive (chemical) portion of heat is less\r\nthan the negative (physical), or it may be, on the contrary, a heating\r\neffect. This is actually the case. 124 grams of sodium thiosulphate\r\n(employed in photography) Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3},5H_{2}O in melting (at 48°)\r\nabsorbs 9,700 units of heat, but in dissolving in a large quantity of\r\nwater at the ordinary temperature it absorbs 5,700 units of heat, which\r\nshows the evolution of heat (about + 4,000 units), notwithstanding the\r\ncooling effect observed in the process of solution, in the act of the\r\nchemical combination of the salt with water.[25] But in most cases\r\nsolid substances in dissolving in water evolve heat, notwithstanding\r\nthe passage into a liquid state, which indicates so considerable an\r\nevolution of (+) heat in the act of combination with water that it\r\nexceeds the absorption of (-) heat dependent on the passage into a\r\nliquid state, Thus, for instance, calcium chloride, CaCl_{2}, magnesium\r\nsulphate, MgSO_{4}, and many other salts evolve heat in dissolving; for\r\nexample, 60 grams of magnesium sulphate evolve about 10,000 units of\r\nheat. Therefore, _in the solution of solid bodies_ either a cooling[26]\r\nor a heating[27] effect is produced, according to the difference of the\r\nreacting affinities. When they are considerable--that is, when water is\r\nwith difficulty separated from the resultant solution, and only with a\r\nrise of temperature (such substances absorb water vapour)--then much\r\nheat is evolved in the process of solution, just as in many reactions of\r\ndirect combination, and therefore a considerable heating of the solution\r\nis observed. Of such a kind, for instance, is the solution of sulphuric\r\nacid (oil of vitriol H_{2}SO_{4}), and of caustic soda (NaHO), &c., in\r\nwater.[28]\r\n\r\n  [25] The latent heat of fusion is determined at the temperature of\r\n       fusion, whilst solution takes place at the ordinary temperature,\r\n       and one must think that at this temperature the latent heat\r\n       would be different, just as the latent heat of evaporation\r\n       varies with the temperature (see Note 11). Besides which, in\r\n       dissolving, disintegration of the particles of both the solvent\r\n       and the substance dissolved takes place, a process which in its\r\n       mechanical aspect resembles evaporation, and therefore must\r\n       consume much heat. The heat emitted in the solution of a solid\r\n       must therefore be considered (Personne) as composed of three\r\n       factors--(1) positive, the effect of combination; (2) negative,\r\n       the effect of transference into a liquid state; and (3) negative,\r\n       the effect of disintegration. In the solution of a liquid by\r\n       a liquid the second factor is removed; and therefore, if the\r\n       heat evolved in combination is greater than that absorbed in\r\n       disintegration a heating effect is observed, and in the reverse\r\n       case a cooling effect; and, indeed, sulphuric acid, alcohol, and\r\n       many liquids evolve heat in dissolving in each other. But the\r\n       solution of chloroform in carbon bisulphide (Bussy and Binget),\r\n       or of phenol (or aniline) in water (Alexéeff), produces cold.\r\n       In the solution of a small quantity of water in acetic acid\r\n       (Abasheff), or hydrocyanic acid (Bussy and Binget), or amyl\r\n       alcohol (Alexéeff), cold is produced, whilst in the solution of\r\n       these substances in an excess of water heat is evolved.\r\n\r\n       The relation existing between the solubility of solid bodies and\r\n       the heat and temperature of fusion and solution has been studied\r\n       by many investigators, and more recently (1893) by Schröder,\r\n       who states that in the solution of a solid body in a solvent\r\n       which does not act chemically upon it, a very simple process\r\n       takes place, which differs but little from the intermixture of\r\n       two gases which do not react chemically upon each other. The\r\n       following relation between the heat of solution _Q_ and the\r\n       heat of fusion _p_ may then be taken: _P_/_T__{0} = _Q_/_T_ =\r\n       constant, where _T__{0} and _T_ are the absolute (from -273°)\r\n       temperatures of fusion and saturation. Thus, for instance, in the\r\n       case of naphthalene the calculated and observed magnitudes of the\r\n       heat of solution differ but slightly from each other.\r\n\r\n       The fullest information concerning the solution of liquids\r\n       in liquids has been gathered by W. T. Alexéeff (1883-1885);\r\n       these data are, however, far from being sufficient to solve\r\n       the mass of problems respecting this subject. He showed that\r\n       two liquids which dissolve in each other, intermix together in\r\n       all proportions at a certain temperature. Thus the solubility\r\n       of phenol, C_{6}H_{6}O, in water, and the converse, is limited\r\n       up to 70°, whilst above this temperature they intermix in all\r\n       proportions. This is seen from the following figures, where p\r\n       is the percentage amount of phenol and _t_ the temperature at\r\n       which the solution becomes turbid--that is, that at which it is\r\n       saturated:--\r\n\r\n       _p_ = 7·12  10·20  15·31  26·15  28·55  36·70  48·86  61·15  71·97\r\n       _t_ = 1°    45°    60°    67°    67°    67°    65°    53°    20°\r\n\r\n       It is exactly the same with the solution of benzene, aniline,\r\n       and other substances in molten sulphur. Alexéeff discovered a\r\n       similar complete intermixture for solutions of secondary butyl\r\n       alcohol in water at about 107°; at lower temperatures the\r\n       solubility is not only limited, but between 50° and 70° it is at\r\n       its minimum, both for solutions of the alcohol in water and for\r\n       water in the alcohol; and at a temperature of 5° both solutions\r\n       exhibit a fresh change in their scale of solubility, so that a\r\n       solution of the alcohol in water which is saturated between 5°\r\n       and 40° will become turbid when heated to 60°. In the solution of\r\n       liquids in liquids, Alexéeff observed a lowering in temperature\r\n       (an absorption of heat) and an absence of change in specific\r\n       heat (calculated for the mixture) much more frequently than had\r\n       been done by previous observers. As regards his hypothesis (in\r\n       the sense of a mechanical and not a chemical representation of\r\n       solutions) that substances in solution preserve their physical\r\n       states (as gases, liquids, or solids), it is very doubtful, for\r\n       it would necessitate admitting the presence of ice in water or\r\n       its vapour.\r\n\r\n       From what has been said above, it will be clear that even in so\r\n       very simple a case as solution, it is impossible to calculate\r\n       the heat emitted by chemical action alone, and that the chemical\r\n       process cannot be separated from the physical and mechanical.\r\n\r\n  [26] The cooling effect produced in the solution of solids (and also in\r\n       the expansion of gases and in evaporation) is applied to the\r\n       _production of low temperatures_. Ammonium nitrate is very often\r\n       used for this purpose; in dissolving in water it absorbs 77 units\r\n       of heat per each part by weight. On evaporating the solution thus\r\n       formed, the solid salt is re-obtained. The application of the\r\n       various _freezing mixtures_ is based on the same principle. Snow\r\n       or broken ice frequently enters into the composition of these\r\n       _mixtures_, advantage being taken of its latent heat of fusion in\r\n       order to obtain the lowest possible temperature (without altering\r\n       the pressure or employing heat, as in other methods of obtaining\r\n       a low temperature). For laboratory work recourse is most often\r\n       had to a mixture of three parts of snow and one part of common\r\n       salt, which causes the temperature to fall from 0° to -21° C.\r\n       Potassium thiocyanate, KCNS, mixed with water (3/4 by weight of\r\n       the salt) gives a still lower temperature. By mixing ten parts of\r\n       crystallised calcium chloride, CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O, with seven parts\r\n       of snow, the temperature may even fall from 0° to -55°.\r\n\r\n  [27] The heat which is evolved in solution, or even in the dilution of\r\n       solutions, is also sometimes made use of in practice. Thus\r\n       caustic soda (NaHO), in dissolving or on the addition of water to\r\n       a strong solution of it, evolves so much heat that it can replace\r\n       fuel. In a steam boiler, which has been previously heated to\r\n       the boiling point, another boiler is placed containing caustic\r\n       soda, and the exhaust steam is made to pass through the latter;\r\n       the formation of steam then goes on for a somewhat long period\r\n       of time without any other heating. Norton makes use of this for\r\n       smokeless street locomotives.\r\n\r\n  [28] [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Curves expressing the contraction,\r\n       quantity of heat, and rises of temperature produced by mixing\r\n       sulphuric acid with water. Percentage of H_{2}SO_{4} is given\r\n       along the axis of abscissae.]\r\n\r\n       The temperatures obtained by mixing monohydrated sulphuric acid,\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4}, with different quantities of water, are shown on\r\n       the lowest curve in fig. 17, the relative proportions of both\r\n       substances being expressed in percentages by weight along the\r\n       horizontal axis. The greatest rise of temperature is 149°. It\r\n       corresponds with the greatest evolution of heat (given on the\r\n       middle curve) corresponding with a definite volume (100 c.c.)\r\n       of the solution produced. The top curve expresses the degree\r\n       of contraction, which also corresponds with 100 volumes of\r\n       the solution produced. The greatest contraction, as also the\r\n       greatest rise of temperature, corresponds with the formation of a\r\n       trihydrate, H_{2}SO_{4},2H_{2}O (= 73·1 p.c. H_{2}SO_{4}), which\r\n       very likely repeats itself in a similar form in other solutions,\r\n       although all the phenomena (of contraction, evolution of heat,\r\n       and rise of temperature) are very complex and are dependent\r\n       on many circumstances. One would think, however, judging from\r\n       the above examples, that all other influences are feebler in\r\n       their action than chemical attraction, especially when it is so\r\n       considerable as between sulphuric acid and water.\r\n\r\nSolution is a reversible reaction; for, if the water be expelled from a\r\nsolution, the substance originally taken is obtained again. But it must\r\nbe borne in mind that the expulsion of the water taken for solution is\r\nnot always accomplished with equal facility, because water has different\r\ndegrees of chemical affinity for the substance dissolved. Thus, if a\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid, which mixes with water in all proportions,\r\nbe heated, it will be found that very different degrees of heat are\r\nrequired to expel the water. When it is in a large excess, water is\r\ngiven off at a temperature slightly above 100°, but if it be in but a\r\nsmall proportion there is such an affinity between it and the sulphuric\r\nacid that at 120°, 150°, 200°, and even at 300°, water is still retained\r\nby the sulphuric acid. The bond between the remaining quantity of water\r\nand the sulphuric acid is evidently stronger than the bond between the\r\nsulphuric acid and the excess of water. The force acting in solutions\r\nis consequently of different intensity, starting from so feeble an\r\nattraction that the properties of water--as, for instance, its power\r\nof evaporation--are but very little changed, and ending with cases of\r\nstrong attraction between the water and the substance dissolved in or\r\nchemically combined with it. In consideration of the very important\r\nsignificance of the phenomena, and of the cases of the breaking up of\r\nsolutions with separation of water or of the substance dissolved from\r\nthem, we shall further discuss them separately, after having acquainted\r\nourselves with certain peculiarities of the solution of gases and of\r\nsolid bodies.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of gases, which is usually measured by the volume of\r\ngas[29] (at 0° and 760 mm. pressure) per 100 volumes of water, varies\r\nnot only with the nature of the gas (and also of the solvent), and with\r\nthe temperature, but also with the pressure, because gases themselves\r\nchange their volume considerably with the pressure. As might be\r\nexpected, (1) gases which are easily liquefied (by pressure and cold)\r\nare more soluble than those which are liquefied with difficulty. Thus,\r\nin 100 volumes of water only two volumes of hydrogen dissolve at 0°\r\nand 760 mm., three volumes of carbonic oxide, four volumes of oxygen,\r\n&c., for these are gases which are liquefied with difficulty; whilst\r\nthere dissolve 180 volumes of carbonic anhydride, 130 of nitrous oxide,\r\nand 437 of sulphurous anhydride, for these are gases which are rather\r\neasily liquefied. (2) The solubility of a gas is diminished by heating,\r\nwhich is easily intelligible from what has been said previously--the\r\nelasticity of a gas becomes greater, it is removed further from a liquid\r\nstate. Thus 100 volumes of water at 0° dissolve 2·5 volumes of air, and\r\nat 20° only 1·7 volume. For this reason cold water, when brought into a\r\nwarm room, parts with a portion of the gas dissolved in it.[30] (3) The\r\nquantity of the gas dissolved varies directly with the pressure. This\r\nrule is called the _law of Henry and Dalton_, and is applicable to those\r\ngases which are little soluble in water. Therefore a gas is separated\r\nfrom its solution in water in a vacuum, and water saturated with a gas\r\nunder great pressure parts with it if the pressure be diminished. Thus\r\nmany mineral springs are saturated underground with carbonic anhydride\r\nunder the great pressure of the column of water above them. On coming\r\nto the surface, the water of these springs boils and foams on giving\r\nup the excess of dissolved gas. Sparkling wines and aërated waters are\r\nsaturated under pressure with the same gas. They hold the gas so long\r\nas they are in a well-corked vessel. When the cork is removed and the\r\nliquid comes in contact with air at a lower pressure, part of the gas,\r\nunable to remain in solution at a lower pressure, is separated as froth\r\nwith the hissing sound familiar to all. It must be remarked that the law\r\nof Henry and Dalton belongs to the class of _approximate laws_, like\r\nthe laws of gases (Gay-Lussac's and Mariotte's) and many others--that\r\nis, it expresses only a portion of a complex phenomenon, the limit\r\ntowards which the phenomenon aims. The matter is rendered complicated\r\nfrom the influence of the degree of solubility and of affinity of the\r\ndissolved gas for water. Gases which are little soluble--for instance,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen--follow the law of Henry and Dalton the\r\nmost closely. Carbonic anhydride exhibits a decided deviation from the\r\nlaw, as is seen from the determinations of Wroblewski (1882). He showed\r\nthat at 0° a cubic centimetre of water absorbs 1·8 cubic centimetre of\r\nthe gas under a pressure of one atmosphere; under 10 atmospheres, 16\r\ncubic centimetres (and not 18, as it should be according to the law);\r\nunder 20 atmospheres, 26·6 cubic centimetres (instead of 36), and under\r\n30 atmospheres, 33·7 cubic centimetres.[31] However, as the researches\r\nof Sechenoff show, the absorption of carbonic anhydride within certain\r\nlimits of change of pressure, and at the ordinary temperature, by\r\nwater--and even by solutions of salts which are not chemically changed\r\nby it, or do not form compounds with it--very closely follows the law of\r\nHenry and Dalton, so that the chemical bond between this gas and water\r\nis so feeble that the breaking up of the solution with separation of\r\nthe gas is accomplished by a decrease of pressure alone.[32] The case\r\nis different if a considerable affinity exists between the dissolved\r\ngas and water. Then it might even be expected that the gas would not be\r\nentirely separated from water in a vacuum, as should be the case with\r\ngases according to the law of Henry and Dalton. Such gases--and, in\r\ngeneral, all those which are very soluble--exhibit a distinct deviation\r\nfrom the law of Henry and Dalton. As examples, ammonia and hydrochloric\r\nacid gas may be taken. The former is separated by boiling and decrease\r\nof pressure, while the latter is not, but they both deviate distinctly\r\nfrom the law.\r\n\r\n        +---------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n        |Pressure in mm.|Ammonia dissolved| Hydrochloric acid  |\r\n        |  of mercury   | in 100 grams of |gas dissolved in 100|\r\n        |               |   water at 0°   |grams of water at 0°|\r\n        +---------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n        |               |      Grams      |       Grams        |\r\n        |       100     |       28·0      |        65·7        |\r\n        |       500     |       69·2      |        78·2        |\r\n        |     1,000     |      112·6      |        85·6        |\r\n        |     1,500     |      165·6      |         --         |\r\n        +---------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\n  [29] If a volume of gas _v_ be measured under a pressure of _h_ mm. of\r\n       mercury (at 0°) and at a temperature _t_° Centigrade, then,\r\n       according to the combined laws of Boyle, Mariotte, and of\r\n       Gay-Lussac, its volume at 0° and 760 mm. will equal the product\r\n       of _v_ into 760 divided by the product of _h_ into 1 + _a__t_°,\r\n       where _a_ is the co-efficient of expansion of gases, which is\r\n       equal to 0·00367. The weight of the gas will be equal to its\r\n       volume at 0° and 760 mm. multiplied by its density referred to\r\n       air and by the weight of one volume of air at 0° and 760 mm.\r\n       The weight of one litre of air under these conditions being =\r\n       1·293 gram. If the density of the gas be given in relation to\r\n       hydrogen this must be divided by 14·4 to bring it in relation to\r\n       air. If the gas be measured when saturated with aqueous vapour,\r\n       then it must be reduced to the volume and weight of the gas when\r\n       dry, according to the rules given in Note 1. If the pressure\r\n       be determined by a column of mercury having a temperature _t_,\r\n       then by dividing the height of the column by 1 + 0·00018_t_ the\r\n       corresponding height at 0° is obtained. If the gas be enclosed in\r\n       a tube in which a liquid stands above the level of the mercury,\r\n       the height of the column of the liquid being = H and its density\r\n       = D, then the gas will be under a pressure which is equal to the\r\n       barometric pressure less HD/13·59, where 13·59 is the density of\r\n       mercury. By these methods the _quantity of a gas_ is determined,\r\n       and its observed volume reduced to normal conditions or to parts\r\n       by weight. The physical data concerning vapours and gases must be\r\n       continually kept in sight in dealing with and measuring gases.\r\n       The student must become perfectly familiar with the calculations\r\n       relating to gases.\r\n\r\n  [30] According to Bunsen, Winkler, Timofeeff, and others, 100 vols. of\r\n       water under a pressure of one atmosphere absorb the following\r\n       volumes of gas (measured at 0° and 760 mm.):--\r\n\r\n            1    2    3     4    5     6     7     8    9    10    11\r\n        0° 4·82 2·35 2·15 179·7 3·54 130·5 437·1 688·6 5·4 104960 7·38\r\n       20° 3·10 1·54 1·83  90·1 2·32  67·0 290·5 362·2 3·5  65400 4·71\r\n\r\n       1, oxygen; 2, nitrogen; 3, hydrogen; 4, carbonic anhydride;\r\n       5, carbonic oxide; 6, nitrous oxide; 7, hydrogen sulphide; 8,\r\n       sulphurous anhydride; 9, marsh gas; 10, ammonia; 11, nitric\r\n       oxide. The decrease of solubility with a rise of temperature\r\n       varies for different gases; it is greater, the greater the\r\n       molecular weight of the gas. It is shown by calculation that\r\n       this decrease varies (Winkler) as the cube root of the molecular\r\n       weight of the gas. This is seen from the following table:\r\n\r\n             +--------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n             | Decrease of  | Cube root of| Ratio between |\r\n             | solubility   |  molecular  | decrease and  |\r\n             | per 20° in   |   weight.   | cube root of  |\r\n             |  per cent.   |             |   mol. wt.    |\r\n             +--------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n             | H_{2}  15·32 |    1·259    |     12·17     |\r\n             | N_{2}  34·33 |    3·037    |     11·30     |\r\n             | CO     34·44 |    3·037    |     11·34     |\r\n             | NO     36·24 |    3·107    |     11·66     |\r\n             | O_{2}  36·55 |    3·175    |     11·51     |\r\n             +--------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n       The decrease in the coefficient of absorption with the\r\n       temperature must be connected with a change in the physical\r\n       properties of the water. Winkler (1891) remarked a certain\r\n       relation between the internal friction and the coefficient of\r\n       absorption at various temperatures.\r\n\r\n  [31] These figures show that the co-efficient of solubility decreases\r\n       with an increase of pressure, notwithstanding that the carbonic\r\n       anhydride approaches a liquid state. As a matter of fact,\r\n       liquefied carbonic anhydride does not intermix with water,\r\n       and does not exhibit a rapid increase in solubility at its\r\n       temperature of liquefaction. This indicates, in the first place,\r\n       that solution does not consist in liquefaction, and in the\r\n       second place that the solubility of a substance is determined\r\n       by a peculiar attraction of water for the substance dissolving.\r\n       Wroblewski even considered it possible to admit that a dissolved\r\n       gas retains its properties as a gas. This he deduced from\r\n       experiments, which showed that the rate of diffusion of gases\r\n       in a solvent is, for gases of different densities, inversely\r\n       proportional to the square roots of their densities, just as\r\n       the velocities of gaseous molecules (see Note 34). Wroblewski\r\n       showed the affinity of water, H_{2}O, for carbonic anhydride,\r\n       CO_{2}, from the fact that on expanding moist compressed carbonic\r\n       anhydride (compressed at 0° under a pressure of 10 atmospheres)\r\n       he obtained (a fall in temperature takes place from the\r\n       expansion) a very unstable definite crystalline compound, CO_{2}\r\n       + 8H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [32] As, according to the researches of Roscoe and his collaborators,\r\n       ammonia exhibits a considerable deviation at low temperatures\r\n       from the law of Henry and Dalton, whilst at 100° the deviation\r\n       is small, it would appear that the dissociating influence of\r\n       temperature affects all gaseous solutions; that is, at high\r\n       temperatures, the solutions of all gases will follow the law, and\r\n       at lower temperatures there will in all cases be a deviation from\r\n       it.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked, for instance, from this table that whilst the\r\npressure increased 10 times, the solubility of ammonia only increased\r\n4-1/2 times.\r\n\r\nA number of examples of such cases of the absorption of gases by liquids\r\nmight be cited which do not in any way, even approximately, agree with\r\nthe laws of solubility. Thus, for instance, carbonic anhydride is\r\nabsorbed by a solution of caustic potash in water, and if sufficient\r\ncaustic potash be present it is not separated from the solution by\r\na decrease of pressure. This is a case of more intimate chemical\r\ncombination. A correlation less completely studied, but similar and\r\nclearly chemical, appears in certain cases of the solution of gases in\r\nwater, and we shall afterwards find an example of this in the solution\r\nof hydrogen iodide; but we will first stop to consider a remarkable\r\napplication of the law of Henry and Dalton[33] in the case of the\r\nsolution of a mixture of two gases, and this we must do all the more\r\nbecause the phenomena which there take place cannot be foreseen without\r\na clear theoretical representation of the nature of gases.[34]\r\n\r\n  [33] The ratio between the pressure and the amount of gas dissolved\r\n       was discovered by Henry in 1805, and Dalton in 1807 pointed\r\n       out the adaptability of this law to cases of gaseous mixtures,\r\n       introducing the conception of partial pressures which is\r\n       absolutely necessary for a right comprehension of Dalton's law.\r\n       The conception of partial pressures essentially enters into\r\n       that of the diffusion of vapours in gases (footnote 1); for\r\n       the pressure of damp air is equal to the sum of the pressures\r\n       of dry air and of the aqueous vapour in it, and it is admitted\r\n       as a corollary to Dalton's law that evaporation in dry air\r\n       takes place as in a vacuum. It is, however, necessary to remark\r\n       that the volume of a mixture of two gases (or vapours) is only\r\n       approximately equal to the sum of the volumes of its constituents\r\n       (the same, naturally, also refers to their pressures)--that is to\r\n       say, in mixing gases a change of volume occurs, which, although\r\n       small, is quite apparent when carefully measured. For instance,\r\n       in 1888 Brown showed that on mixing various volumes of sulphurous\r\n       anhydride (SO_{2}) with carbonic anhydride (at equal pressures\r\n       of 760 mm. and equal temperatures) a decrease of pressure of\r\n       3·9 millimetres of mercury was observed. The possibility of a\r\n       chemical action in similar mixtures is evident from the fact that\r\n       equal volumes of sulphurous and carbonic anhydrides at -19° form,\r\n       according to Pictet's researches in 1888, a liquid which may be\r\n       regarded as an unstable chemical compound, or a solution similar\r\n       to that given when sulphurous anhydride and water combine to an\r\n       unstable chemical whole.\r\n\r\n  [34] The origin of the kinetic theory of gases now generally accepted,\r\n       according to which they are animated by a rapid progressive\r\n       motion, is very ancient (Bernouilli and others in the last\r\n       century had already developed a similar representation), but\r\n       it was only generally accepted after the mechanical theory of\r\n       heat had been established, and after the work of Krönig (1855),\r\n       and especially after its mathematical side had been worked out\r\n       by Clausius and Maxwell. The pressure, elasticity, diffusion,\r\n       and internal friction of gases, the laws of Boyle, Mariotte,\r\n       and of Gay-Lussac and Avogadro-Gerhardt are not only explained\r\n       (deduced) by the kinetic theory of gases, but also expressed\r\n       with perfect exactitude; thus, for example, the magnitude of\r\n       the internal friction of different gases was foretold with\r\n       exactitude by Maxwell, by applying the theory of probabilities\r\n       to the impact of gaseous particles. The kinetic theory of gases\r\n       must therefore be considered as one of the most brilliant\r\n       acquisitions of the latter half of the present century. The\r\n       velocity of the progressive motion of the particles of a gas, one\r\n       cubic centimetre of which weighs _d_ grams, is found, according\r\n       to the theory, to be equal to the square root of the product of\r\n       3_pDq_ divided by _d_, where _p_ is the pressure under which _d_\r\n       is determined expressed in centimetres of the mercury column,\r\n       _D_ the weight of a cubic centimetre of mercury in grams (_D_\r\n       = 13·59, _p_ = 76, consequently the normal pressure = 1,033\r\n       grams on a sq. cm.), and _g_ the acceleration of gravity in\r\n       centimetres (_g_ = 980·5, at the sea level and long. 45° = 981·92\r\n       at St. Petersburg; in general it varies with the longitude and\r\n       altitude of the locality). Therefore, at 0° the velocity of\r\n       hydrogen is 1,843, and of oxygen 461, metres per second. This\r\n       is the average velocity, and (according to Maxwell and others)\r\n       it is probable that the velocities of individual particles\r\n       are different; that is, they occur in, as it were, different\r\n       conditions of temperature, which it is very important to take\r\n       into consideration in investigating many phenomena proper to\r\n       matter. It is evident from the above determination of the\r\n       velocity of gases, that different gases at the same temperature\r\n       and pressure have average velocities, which are inversely\r\n       proportional to the square roots of their densities; this is also\r\n       shown by direct experiment on the flow of gases through a fine\r\n       orifice, or through a porous wall. This _dissimilar velocity of\r\n       flow_ for different gases is frequently taken advantage of in\r\n       chemical researches (see Chap. II. and also Chap. VII.) in order\r\n       to separate two gases having different densities and velocities.\r\n       The difference of the velocity of flow of gases also determines\r\n       the phenomenon cited in the following footnote for demonstrating\r\n       the existence of an internal motion in gases.\r\n\r\n       If for a certain mass of a gas which fully and exactly follows\r\n       the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac the temperature _t_ and the\r\n       pressure _p_ be changed simultaneously, then the entire change\r\n       would be expressed by the equation _pv_ = _C_(1 + _at_), or,\r\n       what is the same, _pv_ = _RT_, where _T_ = _t_ + 273 and _C_\r\n       and _R_ are constants which vary not only with the units taken\r\n       but with the nature of the gas and its mass. But as there are\r\n       discrepancies from both the fundamental laws of gases (which\r\n       will be discussed in the following chapter), and as, on the\r\n       one hand, a certain attraction between the gaseous molecules\r\n       must be admitted, while on the other hand the molecules of\r\n       gases themselves must occupy a portion of a space, hence for\r\n       ordinary gases, within any considerable variation of pressure and\r\n       temperature, recourse should be had to Van der Waal's formula--\r\n\r\n                (_p_ + _a_/_v_^2)(_v_-_p_) = R(1 + _at_)\r\n\r\n       where _a_ is the true co-efficient of expansion of gases.\r\n\r\n       The formula of Van der Waals has an especially important\r\n       significance in the case of the passage of a gas into a liquid\r\n       state, because the fundamental properties of both gases and\r\n       liquids are equally well expressed by it, although only in their\r\n       general features.\r\n\r\n       The further development of the questions referring to the\r\n       subjects here touched on, which are of especial interest for the\r\n       theory of solutions, must be looked for in special memoirs and\r\n       works on theoretical and physical chemistry. A small part of this\r\n       subject will be partially considered in the footnotes of the\r\n       following chapter.\r\n\r\n_The law of partial pressures_ is as follows:--The solubility of gases\r\nin intermixture with each other does not depend on the influence of\r\nthe total pressure acting on the mixture, but on the influence of that\r\nportion of the total pressure which is due to the volume of each given\r\ngas in the mixture. Thus, for instance, if oxygen and carbonic anhydride\r\nwere mixed in equal volumes and exerted a pressure of 760 millimetres,\r\nthen water would dissolve so much of each of these gases as would be\r\ndissolved if each separately exerted a pressure of half an atmosphere,\r\nand in this case, at 0° one cubic centimetre of water would dissolve\r\n0·02 cubic centimetre of oxygen and 0·90 cubic centimetre of carbonic\r\nanhydride. If the pressure of a gaseous mixture equals _h_, and in _n_\r\nvolumes of the mixture there be _a_ volumes of a given gas, then its\r\nsolution will proceed as though this gas were dissolved under a pressure\r\n(_h_ × _a_)/_n_. That portion of the pressure under influence of which\r\nthe solution proceeds is termed the 'partial' pressure.\r\n\r\nIn order to clearly understand the cause of the law of partial\r\npressures, an explanation must be given of the fundamental properties\r\nof gases. Gases are elastic and disperse in all directions. We are led\r\nfrom what we know of gases to the assumption that these fundamental\r\nproperties of gases are due to a rapid progressive motion, in all\r\ndirections, which is proper to their smallest particles (molecules).[35]\r\nThese molecules in impinging against an obstacle produce a pressure.\r\nThe greater the number of molecules impinging against an obstacle in\r\na given time, the greater the pressure. The pressure of a separate\r\ngas or of a gaseous mixture depends on the sum of the pressures of\r\nall the molecules, on the number of blows in a unit of time on a unit\r\nof surface, and on the mass and velocity (or the _vis viva_) of the\r\nimpinging molecules. The nature of the different molecules is of no\r\naccount; the obstacle is acted on by a pressure due to the sum of their\r\n_vis viva_. But, in a chemical action such as the solution of gases,\r\nthe nature of the impinging molecules plays, on the contrary, the\r\nmost important part. In impinging against a liquid, a portion of the\r\ngas enters into the liquid itself, and is held by it so long as other\r\ngaseous molecules impinge against the liquid--exert a pressure on it. As\r\nregards the solubility of a given gas, for the number of blows it makes\r\non the surface of a liquid, it is immaterial whether other molecules\r\nof gases impinge side by side with it or not. Hence, the solubility\r\nof a given gas will be proportional, not to the total pressure of a\r\ngaseous mixture, but to that portion of it which is due to the given\r\ngas separately. Moreover, the saturation of a liquid by a gas depends\r\non the fact that the molecules of gases that have entered into a liquid\r\ndo not remain at rest in it, although they enter in a harmonious kind\r\nof motion with the molecules of the liquid, and therefore they throw\r\nthemselves off from the surface of the liquid (just like its vapour\r\nif the liquid be volatile). If in a unit of time an equal number of\r\nmolecules penetrate into (leap into) a liquid and leave (or leap out\r\nof) a liquid, it is saturated. It is a case of mobile equilibrium, and\r\nnot of rest. Therefore, if the pressure be diminished, the number of\r\nmolecules departing from the liquid will exceed the number of molecules\r\nentering into the liquid, and a fresh state of mobile equilibrium only\r\ntakes place under a fresh equality of the number of molecules departing\r\nfrom and entering into the liquid. In this manner the main features of\r\nthe solution are explained, and furthermore of that special (chemical)\r\nattraction (penetration and harmonious motion) of a gas for a liquid,\r\nwhich determines both the measure of solubility and the degree of\r\nstability of the solution produced.\r\n\r\n  [35] Although the actual motion of gaseous molecules, which is accepted\r\n       by the kinetic theory of gases, cannot be seen, yet its existence\r\n       may be rendered evident by taking advantage of the difference in\r\n       the velocities undoubtedly belonging to different gases which\r\n       are of different densities under equal pressures. The molecules\r\n       of a light gas must move more rapidly than the molecules of\r\n       a heavier gas in order to produce the same pressure. Let us\r\n       take, therefore, two gases--hydrogen and air; the former is\r\n       14·4 times lighter than the latter, and hence the molecules of\r\n       hydrogen must move almost four times more quickly than air (more\r\n       exactly 3·8, according to the formula given in the preceding\r\n       footnote). Consequently, if a porous cylinder containing air is\r\n       introduced into an atmosphere of hydrogen, then in a given time\r\n       the volume of hydrogen which succeeds in entering the cylinder\r\n       will be greater than the volume of air leaving the cylinder, and\r\n       therefore the pressure inside the cylinder will rise until the\r\n       gaseous mixture (of air and hydrogen) attains an equal density\r\n       both inside and outside the cylinder. If now the experiment\r\n       be reversed and air surround the cylinder, and hydrogen be\r\n       inside the cylinder, then more gas will leave the cylinder than\r\n       enters it, and hence the pressure inside the cylinder will be\r\n       diminished. In these considerations we have replaced the idea of\r\n       the number of molecules by the idea of volumes. We shall learn\r\n       subsequently that equal volumes of different gases contain an\r\n       equal number of molecules (the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt), and\r\n       therefore instead of speaking of the number of molecules we can\r\n       speak of the number of volumes. If the cylinder be partially\r\n       immersed in water the rise and fall of the pressure can be\r\n       observed directly, and the experiment consequently rendered\r\n       self-evident.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the law of partial pressures are exceedingly\r\nnumerous and important. All liquids in nature are in contact with the\r\natmosphere, which, as we shall afterwards see more fully, consists of\r\nan intermixture of gases, chiefly four in number--oxygen, nitrogen,\r\ncarbonic anhydride, and aqueous vapour. 100 volumes of air contain,\r\napproximately, 78 volumes of nitrogen, and about 21 volumes of oxygen;\r\nthe quantity of carbonic anhydride, by volume, does not exceed 0·05.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the quantity of aqueous vapour is much\r\ngreater than this, but it varies of course with climatic conditions. We\r\nconclude from these numbers that the solution of nitrogen in a liquid\r\nin contact with the atmosphere will proceed under a partial pressure of\r\n(78/100) × 760 mm. if the atmospheric pressure equal 760 mm.; similarly,\r\nunder a pressure of 600 mm. of mercury, the solution of oxygen will\r\nproceed under a partial pressure of about 160 mm., and the solution of\r\ncarbonic anhydride only under the very small pressure of 0·4 mm. As,\r\nhowever, the solubility of oxygen in water is twice that of nitrogen,\r\nthe ratio of O to N dissolved in water will be greater than the ratio in\r\nair. It is easy to calculate what quantity of each of the gases will be\r\ncontained in water, and taking the simplest case we will calculate what\r\nquantity of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic anhydride will be dissolved\r\nfrom air having the above composition at 0° and 760 mm. pressure. Under\r\na pressure of 760 mm. 1 cubic centimetre of water dissolves 0·0203\r\ncubic centimetre of nitrogen or under the partial pressure of 600 mm. it\r\nwill dissolve 0·0203 × 600/760, or 0·0160 cubic centimetre; of oxygen\r\n0·0411 × 160/760, or 0·0086 cubic centimetre; of carbonic anhydride 1·8\r\n× 0·4/760 or 0·00095 cubic centimetre: hence, 100 cubic centimetres\r\nof water will contain at 0° altogether 2·55 cubic centimetres of\r\natmospheric gases, and 100 volumes of air dissolved in water will\r\ncontain about 62 p.c. of nitrogen, 34 p.c. of oxygen, and 4 p.c. of\r\ncarbonic anhydride. The water of rivers, wells, &c. usually contains\r\nmore carbonic anhydride. This proceeds from the oxidation of organic\r\nsubstances falling into the water. The amount of oxygen, however,\r\ndissolved in water appears to be actually about 1/3 the dissolved gases,\r\nwhilst air contains only 1/5 of it by volume.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of partial pressures, whatever gas be dissolved in\r\nwater will be expelled from the solution in an atmosphere of another\r\ngas. This depends on the fact that gases dissolved in water escape\r\nfrom it in a vacuum, because the pressure is nil. An atmosphere of\r\nanother gas acts like a vacuum on a gas dissolved in water. Separation\r\nthen proceeds, because the molecules of the dissolved gas no longer\r\nimpinge upon the liquid, are not dissolved in it, and those previously\r\nheld in solution leave the liquid in virtue of their elasticity.[36]\r\nFor the same reason a gas may be entirely expelled from a gaseous\r\nsolution by boiling--at least, in many cases when it does not form\r\nparticularly stable compounds with water. In fact the surface of the\r\nboiling liquid will be occupied by aqueous vapour, and therefore all\r\nthe pressure acting on the gas will be due to the aqueous vapour. On\r\nthis account, the partial pressure of the dissolved gas will be very\r\ninconsiderable, and this is the sole reason why _a gas separates from a\r\nsolution on boiling the liquid containing it_. At the boiling point of\r\nwater the solubility of gases in water is still sufficiently great for a\r\nconsiderable quantity of a gas to remain in solution. The gas dissolved\r\nin the liquid is carried away, together with the aqueous vapour; if\r\nboiling be continued for a long time, all the gas will finally be\r\nseparated.[37]\r\n\r\n  [36] Here two cases occur; either the atmosphere surrounding the\r\n       solution may be limited, or it may be proportionally so vast\r\n       as to be unlimited, like the earth's atmosphere. If a gaseous\r\n       solution be brought into an atmosphere of another gas which is\r\n       limited--for instance, as in a closed vessel--then a portion of\r\n       the gas held in solution will be expelled, and thus pass over\r\n       into the atmosphere surrounding the solution, and will produce\r\n       its partial pressure. Let us imagine that water saturated with\r\n       carbonic anhydride at 0° and under the ordinary pressure is\r\n       brought into an atmosphere of a gas which is not absorbed by\r\n       water; for instance, that 10 c.c. of an aqueous solution of\r\n       carbonic anhydride is introduced into a vessel holding 10 c.c.\r\n       of such a gas. The solution will contain 18 c.c. of carbonic\r\n       anhydride. The expulsion of this gas proceeds until a state\r\n       of equilibrium is arrived at. The liquid will then contain a\r\n       certain amount of carbonic anhydride, which is retained under the\r\n       partial pressure of that gas which has been expelled. Now, how\r\n       much gas will remain in the liquid and how much will pass over\r\n       into the surrounding atmosphere? In order to solve this problem,\r\n       let us suppose that _x_ cubic centimetres of carbonic anhydride\r\n       are retained in the solution. It is evident that the amount\r\n       of carbonic anhydride which passed over into the surrounding\r\n       atmosphere will be 18-_x_, and the total volume of gas will be\r\n       10 + 18-_x_ or 28-_x_ cubic centimetres. The partial pressure\r\n       under which the carbonic anhydride is then dissolved will be\r\n       (supposing that the common pressure remains constant the whole\r\n       time) equal to (18-_x_)/(28-_x_), hence there is not in solution\r\n       18 c.c. of carbonic anhydride (as would be the case were the\r\n       partial pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure), but only\r\n       18(18-_x_)/(28-_x_), which is equal to _x_, and we therefore\r\n       obtain the equation 18(18-_x_)/(28-_x_) = _x_, hence _x_ = 8·69.\r\n       Again, where the atmosphere into which the gaseous solution is\r\n       introduced is not only that of another gas but also unlimited,\r\n       then the gas dissolved will, on passing over from the solution,\r\n       diffuse into this atmosphere, and produce an infinitely small\r\n       pressure in the unlimited atmosphere. Consequently, no gas can\r\n       be retained in solution under this infinitely small pressure,\r\n       and it will be entirely expelled from the solution. For this\r\n       reason water saturated with a gas which is not contained in air,\r\n       will be entirely deprived of the dissolved gas if left exposed\r\n       to the air. Water also passes off from a solution into the\r\n       atmosphere, and it is evident that there might be such a case as\r\n       a constant proportion between the quantity of water vaporised and\r\n       the quantity of a gas expelled from a solution, so that not the\r\n       gas alone, but the entire gaseous solution, would pass off. A\r\n       similar case is exhibited in solutions which are not decomposed\r\n       by heat (such as those of hydrogen chloride and iodide), as will\r\n       afterwards be considered.\r\n\r\n  [37] However, in those cases when the variation of the co-efficient of\r\n       solubility with the temperature is not sufficiently great, and\r\n       when a known quantity of aqueous vapour and of the gas passes\r\n       off from a solution at the boiling point, an atmosphere may be\r\n       obtained having the same composition as the liquid itself. In\r\n       this case the amount of gas passing over into such an atmosphere\r\n       will not be greater than that held by the liquid, and therefore\r\n       such a gaseous solution will distil over unchanged. The solution\r\n       will then represent, like a solution of hydriodic acid in water,\r\n       a liquid which is not altered by distillation, while the pressure\r\n       under which this distillation takes place remains constant. Thus\r\n       in all its aspects solution presents gradations from the most\r\n       feeble affinities to examples of intimate chemical combination.\r\n       The _amount of heat_ evolved in the solution of equal volumes of\r\n       different gases is in distinct relation with these variations of\r\n       stability and solubility of different gases. 22·3 litres of the\r\n       following gases (at 760 mm. pressure) evolve the following number\r\n       of (gram) units of heat in dissolving in a large mass of water;\r\n       carbonic anhydride 5,600, sulphurous anhydride 7,700, ammonia\r\n       8,800, hydrochloric acid 17,400, and hydriodic acid 19,400. The\r\n       two last-named gases, which are not expelled from their solution\r\n       by boiling, evolve approximately twice as much heat as gases like\r\n       ammonia, which are separated from their solutions by boiling,\r\n       whilst gases which are only slightly soluble evolve very much\r\n       less heat.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the conception of the partial pressures of gases\r\nshould be applied not only to the formations of solutions, but also\r\nto all cases of chemical action of gases. Especially numerous are its\r\napplications to the physiology of respiration, for in these cases it is\r\nonly the oxygen of the atmosphere that acts.[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Among the numerous researches concerning this subject, certain\r\n       results obtained by Paul Bert are cited in Chapter III., and we\r\n       will here point out that Prof. Sechenoff, in his researches on\r\n       the absorption of gases by liquids, very fully investigated the\r\n       phenomena of the solution of carbonic anhydride in solutions\r\n       of various salts, and arrived at many important results, which\r\n       showed that, on the one hand, in the solution of carbonic\r\n       anhydride in solutions of salts on which it is capable of acting\r\n       chemically (for example, sodium carbonate, borax, ordinary sodium\r\n       phosphate), there is not only an increase of solubility, but also\r\n       a distinct deviation from the law of Henry and Dalton; whilst, on\r\n       the other hand, that solutions of salts which are not acted on\r\n       by carbonic anhydride (for example, the chlorides, nitrates, and\r\n       sulphates) absorb less of it, owing to the 'competition' of the\r\n       salt already dissolved, and follow the law of Henry and Dalton,\r\n       but at the same time show undoubted signs of a chemical action\r\n       between the salt, water, and carbonic anhydride. Sulphuric acid\r\n       (whose co-efficient of absorption is 92 vols. per 100), when\r\n       diluted with water, absorbs less and less carbonic anhydride,\r\n       until the hydrate H_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O (co-eff. of absorption then\r\n       equals 66 vols.) is formed; then on further addition of water the\r\n       solubility again rises until a solution of 100 p.c. of water is\r\n       obtained.\r\n\r\nThe solution of _solids_, whilst depending only in a small measure\r\non the pressure under which solution takes place (because solids and\r\nliquids are almost incompressible), is very clearly dependent on the\r\ntemperature. In the great majority of cases the solubility of solids\r\nin water increases with the temperature; and further, the rapidity of\r\nsolution increases also. The latter is determined by the rapidity of\r\ndiffusion of the solution formed into the remainder of the water. The\r\nsolution of a solid in water, although it is as with gases, a physical\r\npassage into a liquid state, is determined, however, by its chemical\r\naffinity for water; this is clearly shown from the fact that in solution\r\nthere occurs a diminution in volume, a change in the boiling point of\r\nwater, a change in the tension of its vapour, in the freezing point,\r\nand in many similar properties. If solution were a physical, and not a\r\nchemical, phenomenon, it would naturally be accompanied by an increase\r\nand not by a diminution of volume, because generally in melting a solid\r\nincreases in volume (its density diminishes). _Contraction_ is the usual\r\nphenomenon accompanying solution and takes place even in the addition\r\nof solutions to water,[39] and in the solution of liquids in water,[40]\r\njust as happens in the combination of substances when evidently new\r\nsubstances are produced.[41] The contraction which takes place in\r\nsolution is, however, very small, a fact which depends on the small\r\ncompressibility of solids and liquids, and on the insignificance of the\r\ncompressing force acting in solution.[42] The change of volume which\r\ntakes place in the solution of solids and liquids, or the alteration in\r\nspecific gravity[43] corresponding with it, depends on peculiarities of\r\nthe dissolving substances, and of water, and, in the majority of cases,\r\nis not proportional to the quantity of the substance dissolved,[44]\r\nshowing the existence of a chemical force between the solvent and the\r\nsubstance dissolved which is of the same nature as in all other forms of\r\nchemical reaction.[45]\r\n\r\n  [39] Kremers made this observation in the following simple form:--He\r\n       took a narrow-necked flask, with a mark on the narrow part (like\r\n       that on a litre flask which is used for accurately measuring\r\n       liquids), poured water into it, and then inserted a funnel,\r\n       having a fine tube which reached to the bottom of the flask.\r\n       Through this funnel he carefully poured a solution of any salt,\r\n       and (having removed the funnel) allowed the liquid to attain a\r\n       definite temperature (in a water bath); he then filled the flask\r\n       up to the mark with water. In this manner two layers of liquid\r\n       were obtained, the heavy saline solution below and water above.\r\n       The flask was then shaken in order to accelerate diffusion, and\r\n       it was observed that the volume became less if the temperature\r\n       remained constant. This can be proved by calculation, if the\r\n       specific gravity of the solutions and water be known. Thus at 15°\r\n       one c.c. of a 20 p.c. solution of common salt weighs 1·1500 gram,\r\n       hence 100 grams occupy a volume of 86·96 c.c. As the sp. gr.\r\n       of water at 15° = 0·99916, therefore 100 grams of water occupy\r\n       a volume of 100·08 c.c. The sum of the volumes is 187·04 c.c.\r\n       After mixing, 200 grams of a 10 p.c. solution are obtained. Its\r\n       specific gravity is 1·0725 (at 15° and referred to water at its\r\n       maximum density), hence the 200 grams will occupy a volume of\r\n       186·48 c.c. The contraction is consequently equal to 0·56 c.c.\r\n\r\n  [40] The contractions produced in the case of the solution of sulphuric\r\n       acid in water are shown in the diagram Fig. 17 (page 77). Their\r\n       maximum is 10·1 c.c. per 100 c.c. of the solution formed. A\r\n       maximum contraction of 4·15 at 0°, 3·78 at 15°, and 3·50 at 30°,\r\n       takes place in the solution of 46 parts by weight of anhydrous\r\n       alcohol in 54 parts of water. This signifies that if, at 0°, 46\r\n       parts by weight of alcohol be taken per 54 parts by weight of\r\n       water, then the sum of their separate volumes will he 104·15, and\r\n       after mixing their total volume will be 100.\r\n\r\n  [41] This subject will be considered later in this work, and we shall\r\n       then see that the contraction produced in reactions of\r\n       combination (of solids or liquids) is very variable in its\r\n       amount, and that there are, although rarely, reactions of\r\n       combination in which contraction does not take place, or when an\r\n       increase of volume is produced.\r\n\r\n  [42] The compressibility of solutions of common salt is less, according\r\n       to Grassi, than that of water. At 18° the compression of water\r\n       per million volumes = 48 vols. for a pressure of one atmosphere;\r\n       for a 15 p.c. solution of common salt it is 32, and for a 24\r\n       p.c. solution 26 vols. Similar determinations were made by Brown\r\n       (1887) for saturated solutions of sal ammoniac (38 vols.), alum\r\n       (46 vols.), common salt (27 vols.), and sodium sulphate at +1°,\r\n       when the compressibility of water = 47 per million volumes.\r\n       This investigator also showed that substances which dissolve\r\n       with an evolution of heat and with an increase in volume (as,\r\n       for instance, sal ammoniac) are partially separated from their\r\n       saturated solutions by an increase of pressure (this experiment\r\n       was particularly conclusive in the case of sal ammoniac), whilst\r\n       the solubility of substances which dissolve with an absorption\r\n       of heat or diminution in volume increases, although very\r\n       slightly, _with an increase of pressure_. Sorby observed the same\r\n       phenomenon with common salt (1863).\r\n\r\n  [43] The most trustworthy data relating to the variation of the\r\n       specific gravity of solutions with a change of their composition\r\n       and temperature, are collected and discussed in my work cited\r\n       in footnote 19. The practical (for the amount of a substance in\r\n       solution is determined by the aid of the specific gravities of\r\n       solutions, both in works and in laboratory practice) and the\r\n       theoretical (for specific gravity can be more accurately observed\r\n       than other properties, and because a variation in specific\r\n       gravity governs the variation of many other properties) interest\r\n       of this subject, besides the strict rules and laws to which it\r\n       is liable, make one wish that this province of data concerning\r\n       solutions may soon be enriched by further observations of as\r\n       accurate a nature as possible. Their collection does not present\r\n       any great difficulty, although requiring much time and attention.\r\n       Pickering in London and Tourbaba in Kharkoff must be ranked first\r\n       among those who have pursued problems of this nature during\r\n       recent years.\r\n\r\n  [44] Inasmuch as the degree of change exhibited in many properties on\r\n       the formation of solutions is not large, so, owing to the\r\n       insufficient accuracy of observations, a proportionality between\r\n       this change and a change of composition may, in a first rough\r\n       approximation and especially within narrow limits of change\r\n       of composition, easily be imagined in cases where it does not\r\n       even exist. The conclusion of Michel and Kraft is particularly\r\n       instructive in this respect; in 1854, on the basis of their\r\n       incomplete researches, they supposed that the increment of the\r\n       specific gravity of solutions was proportional to the increment\r\n       of a salt in a given volume of a solution, which is only true\r\n       for determinations of specific gravity which are exact to\r\n       the second decimal place--an accuracy insufficient even for\r\n       technical determinations. Accurate measurements do not confirm\r\n       a proportionality either in this case or in many others where\r\n       a ratio has been generally accepted; as, for example, for the\r\n       rotatory power (with respect to the plane of polarisation)\r\n       of solutions, and for their capillarity, &c. Nevertheless,\r\n       such a method is not only still made use of, but even has its\r\n       advantages when applied to solutions within a limited scope--as,\r\n       for instance, very weak solutions, and for a first acquaintance\r\n       with the phenomena accompanying solution, and also as a means\r\n       for facilitating the application of mathematical analysis to\r\n       the investigation of the phenomenon of solution. Judging by the\r\n       results obtained in my researches on the specific gravity of\r\n       solutions, I think that in many cases it would be nearer the\r\n       truth to take the change of properties as proportional, not to\r\n       the amount of a substance dissolved, but to the product of this\r\n       quantity and the amount of water in which it is dissolved; the\r\n       more so since many chemical relations vary in proportion to the\r\n       reacting masses, and a similar ratio has been established for\r\n       many phenomena of attraction studied by mechanics. This product\r\n       is easily arrived at when the quantity of water in the solutions\r\n       to be compared is constant, as is shown in investigating the fall\r\n       of temperature in the formation of ice (_see_ footnote 49, p. 91).\r\n\r\n  [45] All the different forms of chemical reaction may be said to take\r\n       place in the process of solution. (1) _Combinations_ between\r\n       the solvent and the substance dissolved, which are more or less\r\n       stable (more or less dissociated). This form of reaction is the\r\n       most probable, and is that most often observed. (2) Reactions\r\n       of _substitution_ or of _double decomposition_ between the\r\n       molecules. Thus it may be supposed that in the solution of\r\n       sal ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, the action of water produces ammonia,\r\n       NH_{4}HO, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, which are dissolved in\r\n       the water and simultaneously attract each other. As these\r\n       solutions and many others do indeed exhibit signs, which are\r\n       sometimes indisputable, of similar double decompositions (thus\r\n       solutions of sal-ammoniac yield a certain amount of ammonia),\r\n       it is probable that this form of reaction is more often met\r\n       with than is generally thought. (3) Reactions of _isomerism_ or\r\n       _replacement_ are also probably met with in solution, all the\r\n       more as here molecules of different kinds come into intimate\r\n       contact, and it is very likely that the configuration of the\r\n       atoms in the molecules under these influences is somewhat\r\n       different from what it was in its original and isolated state.\r\n       One is led to this supposition especially from observations made\r\n       on solutions of substances which rotate the plane of polarisation\r\n       (and observations of this kind are very sensitive with respect\r\n       to the atomic structure of molecules), because they show, for\r\n       example (according to Schneider, 1881), that strong solutions\r\n       of malic acid rotate the plane of polarisation to the right,\r\n       whilst its ammonium salts in all degrees of concentration\r\n       rotate the plane of polarisation to the left. (4) Reactions of\r\n       _decomposition_ under the influences of solution are not only\r\n       rational in themselves, but have in recent years been recognised\r\n       by Arrhenius, Ostwald, and others, particularly on the basis of\r\n       electrolytic determinations. If a portion of the molecules of a\r\n       solution occur in a condition of decomposition, the other portion\r\n       may occur in a yet more complex state of combination, just as the\r\n       velocity of the motion of different gaseous molecules may be far\r\n       from being the same (_see_ Note 34, p. 81).\r\n\r\n       It is, therefore, very probable that the reactions taking place\r\n       in solution vary both quantitatively and qualitatively with\r\n       the mass of water in the solution, and the great difficulty\r\n       in arriving at a definite conclusion as to the nature of the\r\n       chemical relations which take place in the process of solution\r\n       will be understood, and if besides this the existence of a\r\n       physical process, like the sliding between and interpenetration\r\n       of two homogeneous liquids, be also recognised in solution,\r\n       then the complexity of the problem as to the actual nature of\r\n       solutions, which is now to the fore, appears in its true light.\r\n       However, the efforts which are now being applied to the solution\r\n       of this problem are so numerous and of such varied aspect that\r\n       they will afford future investigators a vast mass of material\r\n       towards the construction of a complete theory of solution.\r\n\r\n       For my part, I am of opinion that the study of the physical\r\n       properties of solutions (and especially of weak ones) which now\r\n       obtains, cannot give any fundamental and complete solution of\r\n       the problem whatever (although it should add much to both the\r\n       provinces of physics and chemistry), but that, parallel with it,\r\n       should be undertaken the study of the influence of temperature,\r\n       and especially of low temperatures, the application to solutions\r\n       of the mechanical theory of heat, and the comparative study of\r\n       the chemical properties of solutions. The beginning of all this\r\n       is already established, but it is impossible to consider in so\r\n       short an exposition of chemistry the further efforts of this kind\r\n       which have been made up to the present date.\r\n\r\nThe feeble development of the chemical affinities acting in solutions of\r\nsolids becomes evident from those multifarious methods by which _their\r\nsolutions are decomposed_, whether they be saturated or not. On heating\r\n(absorption of heat), on cooling, and by internal forces alone, aqueous\r\nsolutions in many cases separate into their components or their definite\r\ncompounds with water. The water contained in solutions is removed\r\nfrom them as vapour, or, by freezing, in the form of ice,[46] but the\r\n_tension of the vapour of water_[47] held in solution is less than\r\nthat of water in a free state, and the _temperature of the formation\r\nof ice_ from solutions is lower than 0°. Further, both the diminution\r\nof vapour tension and the lowering of the freezing point proceed, in\r\ndilute solutions, almost in proportion to the amount of a substance\r\ndissolved.[48] Thus, if per 100 grams of water there be in solution\r\n1, 5, 10 grams of common salt (NaCl), then at 100° the vapour tension\r\nof the solutions decreases by 4, 21, 43 mm. of the barometric column,\r\nagainst 760 mm., or the vapour tension of water, whilst the freezing\r\npoints are -0·58°, -2·91°, and -6·10° respectively. The above figures[49]\r\nare almost proportional to the amounts of salt in solution (1, 5, and\r\n10 per 100 of water). Furthermore, it has been shown by experiment that\r\nthe ratio of the diminution of vapour tension to the vapour tension\r\nof water at different temperatures in a given solution is an almost\r\nconstant quantity,[50] and that for every (dilute) solution the ratio\r\nbetween the diminution of vapour tension and of the freezing point is\r\nalso a tolerably constant quantity.[51]\r\n\r\n  [46] If solutions are regarded as being in a state of dissociation\r\n       (_see_ footnote 19, p. 64) it would be expected that they would\r\n       contain free molecules of water, which form one of the products\r\n       of the decomposition of those definite compounds whose formation\r\n       is the cause of solution. In separating as ice or vapour, water\r\n       makes, with a solution, a heterogeneous system (made up of\r\n       substances in different physical states) similar, for instance,\r\n       to the formation of a precipitate or volatile substance in\r\n       reactions of double decomposition.\r\n\r\n  [47] If the substance dissolved is non-volatile (like salt or sugar),\r\n       or only slightly volatile, then the whole of the tension of\r\n       the vapour given off is due to the water, but if a solution\r\n       of a volatile substance--for instance, a gas or a volatile\r\n       liquid--evaporates, then only a portion of the pressure belongs\r\n       to the water, and the whole pressure observed consists of the sum\r\n       of the pressures of the vapours of the water and of the substance\r\n       dissolved. The majority of researches bear on the first case,\r\n       which will be spoken of presently, and the observations of D. P.\r\n       Konovaloff (1881) refer to the second case. He showed that in the\r\n       case of two volatile liquids, mutually soluble in each other,\r\n       forming two layers of saturated solutions (for example, ether\r\n       and water, Note 20, p. 67), both solutions have an equal vapour\r\n       tension (in the case in point the tension of both is equal to 431\r\n       mm. of mercury at 19·8°). Further, he found that for solutions\r\n       which are formed in all proportions, the tension is either\r\n       greater (solutions of alcohol and water) or less (solutions of\r\n       formic acid) than that which answers to the rectilinear change\r\n       (proportional to the composition) from the tension of water\r\n       to the tension of the substance dissolved; thus, the tension,\r\n       for example, of a 70 p.c. solution of formic acid is less, at\r\n       all temperatures, than the tension of water and of formic acid\r\n       itself. In this case the tension of a solution is never equal to\r\n       the sum of the tensions of the dissolving liquids, as Regnault\r\n       already showed when he distinguished this case from that in\r\n       which a mixture of liquids, which are insoluble in each other,\r\n       evaporates. From this it is evident that a mutual action occurs\r\n       in solution, which diminishes the vapour tensions proper to the\r\n       individual substances, as would be expected on the supposition of\r\n       the formation of compounds in solutions, because the elasticity\r\n       then always diminishes.\r\n\r\n  [48] This amount is usually expressed by the weight of the substance\r\n       dissolved per 100 parts by weight of water. Probably it would\r\n       be better to express it by the quantity of the substance in a\r\n       definite volume of the solution--for instance, in a litre--or\r\n       by the ratios of the number of molecules of water and of the\r\n       substance dissolved.\r\n\r\n  [49] The variation of the vapour tension of solutions has been\r\n       investigated by many. The best known researches are those of\r\n       Wüllner in Germany (1858-1860) and of Tamman in Russia (1887).\r\n       The researches on the temperature of the formation of ice from\r\n       various solutions are also very numerous; Blagden (1788),\r\n       Rüdorff (1861), and De Coppet (1871) established the beginning,\r\n       but this kind of investigation takes its chief interest from\r\n       the work of Raoult, begun in 1882 on aqueous solutions, and\r\n       afterwards continued for solutions in various other easily frozen\r\n       liquids--for instance, benzene, C_{6}H_{6} (melts at 4·96°),\r\n       acetic acid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2} (16·75°), and others. An especially\r\n       important interest is attached to these cryoscopic investigations\r\n       of Raoult in France on the depression of the freezing point,\r\n       because he took solutions of many well-known carbon-compounds\r\n       and discovered a simple relation between the molecular weight\r\n       of the substances and the temperature of crystallisation of the\r\n       solvent, which enabled this kind of research to be applied to\r\n       the investigation of the nature of substances. We shall meet\r\n       with the application of this method later on (_see also_ Chapter\r\n       VII.), and at present will only cite the deduction arrived at\r\n       from these results. The solution of one-hundredth part of that\r\n       molecular gram weight which corresponds with the formula of a\r\n       substance dissolved (for example, NaCl = 58·5, C_{2}H_{6}O = 46,\r\n       &c.) in 100 parts of a solvent lowers the freezing point of its\r\n       solution in water 0·185°, in benzene 0·49°, and in acetic acid\r\n       O·39°, or twice as much as with water. And as in weak solutions\r\n       the depression or fall of freezing point is proportional to the\r\n       amount of the substance dissolved, it follows that the fall of\r\n       freezing point for all other solutions may be calculated from\r\n       this rule. So, for instance, the weight which corresponds with\r\n       the formula of acetone, C_{3}H_{6}O is 58; a solution containing\r\n       2·42, 6·22, and 12·35 grams of acetone per 100 grams of water,\r\n       forms ice (according to the determinations of Beckmann) at\r\n       0·770°, 1·930°, and 3·820°, and these figures show that with\r\n       a solution containing 0·58 gram of acetone per 100 of water\r\n       the fall of the temperature of the formation of ice will be\r\n       0·185°, 0·180°, and 0·179°. It must be remarked that the law of\r\n       proportionality between the fall of temperature of the formation\r\n       of ice, and the composition of a solution, is in general only\r\n       approximate, and is only applicable to weak solutions (Pickering\r\n       and others).\r\n\r\n       We will here remark that the theoretical interest of this subject\r\n       was strengthened on the discovery of the connection existing\r\n       between the fall of tension, the fall of the temperature of the\r\n       formation of ice, of osmotic pressure (Van't Hoff, Note 19),\r\n       and of the electrical conductivity of solutions, and we will\r\n       therefore supplement what we have already said on the subject by\r\n       some short remarks on the method of cryoscopic investigations,\r\n       although the details of the subject form the subject of more\r\n       special works on physical chemistry (such as Ostwald's _Lehrbuch\r\n       der allgemeinen Chemie_, 1891-1894, 2 vols.)\r\n\r\n       In order to determine the _temperature of the formation of\r\n       ice_ (or of crystallisation of other solvents), a solution\r\n       of known strength is prepared and poured into a cylindrical\r\n       vessel surrounded by a second similar vessel, leaving a layer\r\n       of air between the two, which, being a bad conductor, prevents\r\n       any rapid change of temperature. The bulb of a sensitive and\r\n       corrected thermometer is immersed in the solution, and also a\r\n       bent platinum wire for stirring the solution; the whole is then\r\n       cooled (by immersing the apparatus in a freezing mixture), and\r\n       the temperature at which ice begins to separate observed. If\r\n       the temperature at first falls slightly lower, it nevertheless\r\n       becomes constant when ice begins to form. By then allowing the\r\n       liquid to get just warm, and again observing the temperature of\r\n       the formation of ice, an exact determination may be arrived at.\r\n       It is still better to take a large mass of solution, and induce\r\n       the formation of the first crystals by dropping a small lump\r\n       of ice into the solution already partially over-cooled. This\r\n       only imperceptibly changes the composition of the solution. The\r\n       observation should be made at the point of formation of only a\r\n       very small amount of crystals, as otherwise the composition of\r\n       the solution will become altered from their separation. Every\r\n       precaution must be taken to prevent the access of moisture to the\r\n       interior of the apparatus, which might also alter the composition\r\n       of the solution or properties of the solvent (for instance, when\r\n       using acetic acid).\r\n\r\n       With respect to the depression of dilute solutions it is\r\n       known--(1) That the depression increases in almost direct\r\n       proportion to the amount of the substance in solution (always\r\n       per 100 parts of water), for example, for KCl when the solution\r\n       contains 1 part of salt (per 100 parts of water) the depression =\r\n       0·45°, when the solution contains 2 parts of salt = 0·90°, with\r\n       10 parts of salt = 4·4°. (2) The greater the molecular weight\r\n       expressed by the formula (see Chapter VII.), and designated\r\n       by M, the less, under other similar conditions, will be the\r\n       depression _d_, and therefore if the concentration of a solution\r\n       (the amount by weight of substance dissolved per 100 parts of\r\n       water) be designated by _p_, then the fraction M_d_/_p_ or the\r\n       molecular depression for a given class of substances will be a\r\n       constant quantity; for example, in the case of methyl alcohol in\r\n       water 17·3, for acetone about 18·0, for sugar about 18·5. (3) In\r\n       general the molecular depression for substances whose solutions\r\n       do not conduct an electric current is about 18·5, while for\r\n       acids, salts, and such like substances whose solutions do conduct\r\n       electricity, it is _i_ times greater; for instance, for HCl, KI,\r\n       HNO_{3}, KHO, &c., about 36 (_i_ is nearly 2), for borax about\r\n       66, and so on where _i_ varies in the same manner as it does in\r\n       the case of the osmotic pressure of solutions (Note 19). (4)\r\n       Different solvents (water, acetic acid, benzene, &c.) have each\r\n       their corresponding constants of molecular depression (which have\r\n       a certain remote connection with their molecular weight); for\r\n       example, for acetic acid the molecular depression is about 39 and\r\n       not 19 (as it is for water), for benzene 49, for methyl alcohol\r\n       about 17, &c. (5) If the molecular weight M of a substance be\r\n       unknown, then in the case of non-conductors of electricity or for\r\n       a given group, it may be found by determining the depression,\r\n       _d_, for a given concentration, _p_; for example, in the case of\r\n       peroxide of hydrogen, which is a non-conductor of electricity,\r\n       the molecular weight, M, was found to be nearly 34, _i.e._ equal\r\n       to H_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\n       Similar results have also been found for the fall in the\r\n       vapour tension of solutions (Note 51), and for the rise of\r\n       their boiling points (hence these data may also serve for\r\n       determining the molecular weight of a substance in solution,\r\n       as is shortly described in Chapter VII., Note 27 bis). And as\r\n       these conclusions are also applicable in the case of osmotic\r\n       pressure (Note 19), and a variation in the magnitude of _i_, in\r\n       passing from solutions which do not conduct an electric current\r\n       to those which do conduct electricity is everywhere remarked,\r\n       so it was natural to here seek that causal connection which\r\n       Arrhenius (1888), Ostwald, and others expected to find in the\r\n       supposition that a portion of the substance of the electrolyte\r\n       is already decomposed in the very act of solution, into its\r\n       ions (for example, NaCl into Na and Cl), or into the atoms of\r\n       those individual substances which make their appearance in\r\n       electrolysis, and in this way to explain the fact that _i_ is\r\n       greater for those bodies which conduct an electric current.\r\n       We will not consider here this supposition, known as the\r\n       hypothesis of 'electrolytic dissociation,' not only because\r\n       it wholly belongs to that special branch--physical chemistry,\r\n       and gives scarcely any help towards explaining the chemical\r\n       relations of solutions (particularly their passage into definite\r\n       compounds, their reactions, and their very formation), but\r\n       also because--(1) all the above data (for constant depression,\r\n       osmotic pressure, &c.) only refer to dilute solutions, and are\r\n       not applicable to strong solutions; whilst the chemical interest\r\n       in strong solutions is not less than in dilute solutions, and\r\n       the transition from the former into the latter is consecutive\r\n       and inevitable; (2) because in all homogeneous bodies (although\r\n       it may be insoluble and not an electrolyte) a portion of the\r\n       atoms may he supposed (Clausius) to be passing from one particle\r\n       to another (Chapter X., Note 28), and as it were dissociated,\r\n       but there are no reasons for believing that such a phenomenon\r\n       is proper to the solutions of electrolytes only; (3) because no\r\n       essential mark of difference is observed between the solution of\r\n       electrolytes and non-conductors, although it might be expected\r\n       there would be according to Arrhenius' hypothesis; (4) because it\r\n       is most reasonable to suppose the formation of new, more complex,\r\n       but unstable and easily dissociated compounds in the act of\r\n       solution, than a decomposition, even partial, of the substances\r\n       taken; (5) because if Arrhenius' hypothesis be accepted it\r\n       becomes necessary to admit the existence in solutions of free\r\n       ions, like the atoms Cl or Na, without any apparent expenditure\r\n       of the energy necessary for their disruption, and if in this case\r\n       it can be explained why _i_ then = 2, it is not at all clear why\r\n       solutions of MgSO_{4} give _i_ = 1, although the solution does\r\n       conduct an electric current; (6) because in dilute solutions,\r\n       the approximative proportionality between the depression and\r\n       concentration may be recognised, while admitting the formation\r\n       of hydrates, with as much right as in admitting the solution\r\n       of anhydrous substances, and if the formation of hydrates be\r\n       recognised it is easier to admit that a portion of these hydrates\r\n       is decomposed than to accept the breaking-up into ions; (7)\r\n       because the best conductors of electricity are solutions like the\r\n       sulphates in which it is necessary to recognise the formation\r\n       of associated systems or hydrates; (8) because the cause of\r\n       electro-conductivity can be sooner looked for in this affinity\r\n       and this combination of the substance dissolved with the solvent,\r\n       as is seen from the fact, that (D. P. Konovaloff) neither aniline\r\n       nor acetic acid alone conduct an electric current, a solution\r\n       of aniline in water conducts it badly (and here the affinity is\r\n       very small), while a solution of aniline in acetic acid forms a\r\n       good electrolyte, in which, without doubt, chemical forces are\r\n       acting, bringing aniline, like ammonia, into combination with the\r\n       acetic acid; which is evident from the researches made by Prof.\r\n       Konovaloff upon mixtures (solutions) of aniline and other amines;\r\n       and, lastly, (9) because I, together with many of the chemists\r\n       of the present day, cannot regard the hypothesis of electrolytic\r\n       dissociation in the form given to it up to now by Arrhenius and\r\n       Ostwald, as answering to the sum total of the chemical data\r\n       respecting solutions and dissociation in general. Thus, although\r\n       I consider it superfluous to discuss further the evolution of\r\n       the above theory of solutions, still I think that it would he\r\n       most useful for students of chemistry to consider all the data\r\n       referring to this subject, which can be found in the _Zeitschrift\r\n       für physikalische Chemie_, 1888-1894.\r\n\r\n  [50] This fact, which was established by Gay-Lussac, Pierson, and\r\n       v. Babo, is confirmed by the latest observations, and enables us\r\n       to express not only the fall of tension (_p_-_p_´) itself, but\r\n       its ratio to the tension of water (_p_-_p_´)/_p_. It is to be\r\n       remarked that in the absence of any chemical action, the fall of\r\n       pressure is either very small, or does not exist at all (note\r\n       33), and is not proportional to the quantity of the substance\r\n       added. As a rule, the tension is then equal, according to the law\r\n       of Dalton, to the sum of the tensions of the substances taken.\r\n       Hence liquids which are insoluble in each other (for example,\r\n       water and chloride of carbon) present a tension equal to the sum\r\n       of their individual tensions, and therefore such a mixture boils\r\n       at a lower temperature than the more volatile liquid (Magnus,\r\n       Regnault).\r\n\r\n  [51] If, in the example of common salt, the fall of tension be divided\r\n       by the tension of water, a figure is obtained which is nearly\r\n       105 times less than the magnitude of the fall of temperature of\r\n       formation of ice. This correlation was theoretically deduced\r\n       by Goldberg, on the basis of the application of the mechanical\r\n       theory of heat, and is repeated by many investigated solutions.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of the vapour tension of solutions explains the rise in\r\nboiling point due to the solution of solid non-volatile bodies in water.\r\nThe temperature of a vapour is the same as that of the solution from\r\nwhich it is generated, and therefore it follows that the aqueous vapour\r\ngiven off from a solution will be superheated. A saturated solution\r\nof common salt boils at 108·4°, a solution of 335 parts of nitre in\r\n100 parts of water at 115·9°, and a solution of 325 parts of potassium\r\nchloride in 100 parts of water at 179°, if the temperature of ebullition\r\nbe determined by immersing the thermometer bulb in the liquid itself.\r\nThis is another proof of the bond which exists between water and the\r\nsubstance dissolved. And this bond is seen still more clearly in those\r\ncases (for example, in the solution of nitric or formic acid in water)\r\nwhere the solution boils at a higher temperature than either water or\r\nthe volatile substance dissolved in it. For this reason the solutions of\r\ncertain gases--for instance, hydriodic or hydrochloric acid--boil above\r\n100°.\r\n\r\nThe separation of ice from solutions[52] explains both the phenomenon,\r\nwell known to sailors, that the ice formed from salt water gives fresh\r\nwater, and also the fact that by freezing, just as by evaporation, a\r\nsolution is obtained which is richer in salts than before. This is taken\r\nadvantage of in cold countries for obtaining a liquor from sea water,\r\nwhich is then evaporated for the extraction of salt.\r\n\r\n  [52] Fritzsche showed that solutions of certain colouring matters yield\r\n       colourless ice, which clearly proves the passage of water only\r\n       into a solid state, without any intermixture of the substance\r\n       dissolved, although the possibility of the admixture in certain\r\n       other cases cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nOn the removal of part of the water from a solution (by evaporation\r\nor the separation of ice), a saturated solution should be obtained,\r\nand then the solid substance dissolved should separate out. Solutions\r\nsaturated at a certain temperature should also separate out a\r\ncorresponding portion of the substance dissolved if they be reduced,\r\nby cooling,[53] to a temperature at which the water can no longer hold\r\nthe former quantity of the substance in solution. If this separation,\r\nby cooling a saturated solution or by evaporation, take place slowly,\r\n_crystals_ of the substance dissolved are in many cases formed; and\r\nthis is the method by which crystals of soluble salts are usually\r\nobtained. Certain solids very easily separate out from their solutions\r\nin perfectly formed crystals, which may attain very large dimensions.\r\nSuch are nickel sulphate, alum, sodium carbonate, chrome-alum, copper\r\nsulphate, potassium ferricyanide, and a whole series of other salts.\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance in this is that many solids in\r\nseparating out from an aqueous solution retain a portion of water,\r\nforming crystallised solid substances which contain water. A portion\r\nof the water previously in the solution remains in the separated\r\ncrystals. The water which is thus retained is called the _water of\r\ncrystallisation_. Alum, copper sulphate, Glauber's salt, and magnesium\r\nsulphate contain such water, but neither sal-ammoniac, table salt,\r\nnitre, potassium chlorate, silver nitrate, nor sugar, contains any\r\nwater of crystallisation. One and the same substance may separate out\r\nfrom a solution with or without water of crystallisation, according\r\nto the temperature at which the crystals are formed. Thus common salt\r\nin crystallising from its solution in water at the ordinary or at a\r\nhigher temperature does not contain water of crystallisation. But if\r\nits separation from the solution takes place at a low temperature,\r\nnamely below -5°, then the crystals contain 38 parts of water in 100\r\nparts. Crystals of the same substance which separate out at different\r\ntemperatures may contain different amounts of water of crystallisation.\r\nThis proves to us that a solid dissolved in water may form various\r\ncompounds with it, differing in their properties and composition,\r\nand capable of appearing in a solid separate form like many ordinary\r\ndefinite compounds. This is indicated by the numerous properties and\r\nphenomena connected with solutions, and gives reason for thinking that\r\nthere exist in solutions themselves such compounds of the substance\r\ndissolved, and the solvent or compounds similar to them, only in a\r\nliquid partly decomposed form. Even the _colour of solutions_ may\r\noften confirm this opinion. Copper sulphate forms crystals having a\r\nblue colour and containing water of crystallisation. If the water\r\nof crystallisation be removed by heating the crystals to redness, a\r\ncolourless anhydrous substance is obtained (a white powder). From this\r\nit may be seen that the blue colour belongs to the compound of the\r\ncopper salt with water. Solutions of copper sulphate are all blue, and\r\nconsequently they contain a compound similar to the compound formed by\r\nthe salt with its water of crystallisation. Crystals of cobalt chloride\r\nwhen dissolved in an anhydrous liquid--like alcohol, for instance--give\r\na blue solution, but when they are dissolved in water a red solution is\r\nobtained. Crystals from the aqueous solution, according to Professor\r\nPotilitzin, contain six times as much water (CoCl_{2},6H_{2}O) for a\r\ngiven weight of the salt, as those violet crystals (CoCl_{2},H_{2}O)\r\nwhich are formed by the evaporation of an alcoholic solution.\r\n\r\n  [53] As the solubility of certain substances (for example, coniine,\r\n       cerium sulphate, and others) decreases with a rise of temperature\r\n       (between certain limits--see, for example, note 24), so these\r\n       substances do not separate from their saturated solutions on\r\n       cooling but on heating. Thus a solution of manganese sulphate,\r\n       saturated at 70°, becomes cloudy on further heating. The point at\r\n       which a substance separates from its solution with a change of\r\n       temperature gives an easy means of determining the co-efficient\r\n       of solubility, and this was taken advantage of by Prof. Alexéeff\r\n       for determining the solubility of many substances. The phenomenon\r\n       and method of observation are here essentially the same as in\r\n       the determination of the temperature of formation of ice. If a\r\n       solution of a substance which separates out on heating be taken\r\n       (for example, the sulphate of calcium or manganese), then at a\r\n       certain fall of temperature ice will separate out from it, and\r\n       at a certain rise of temperature the salt will separate out.\r\n       From this example, and from general considerations, it is clear\r\n       that the separation of a substance dissolved from a solution\r\n       should present a certain analogy to the separation of ice from a\r\n       solution. In both cases, a heterogeneous system of a solid and a\r\n       liquid is formed from a homogeneous (liquid) system.\r\n\r\nThat solutions contain particular compounds with water is further shown\r\nby the phenomena of supersaturated solutions, of so-called cryohydrates,\r\nof solutions of certain acids having constant boiling points, and the\r\nproperties of compounds containing water of crystallisation whose data\r\nit is indispensable to keep in view in the consideration of solutions.\r\n\r\nSupersaturated solutions exhibit the following phenomena:--On the\r\nrefrigeration of a saturated solution of certain salts,[54] if the\r\nliquid be brought under certain conditions, the excess of the solid\r\nmay sometimes remain in solution and not separate out. A great number\r\nof substances, and more especially sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, or\r\nGlauber's salt, easily form supersaturated solutions. If boiling water\r\nbe saturated with this salt, and the solution be poured off from any\r\nremaining undissolved salt, and, the boiling being still continued,\r\nthe vessel holding the solution be well closed by cotton wool, or by\r\nfusing up the vessel, or by covering the solution with a layer of oil,\r\nthen it will he found that this saturated solution does not separate\r\nout any Glauber's salt whatever on cooling down to the ordinary or even\r\nto a much lower temperature; although without the above precautions a\r\nsalt separates out on cooling, in the form of crystals, which contain\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O--that is, 180 parts of water for 142 parts of\r\nanhydrous salt. The supersaturated solution may be moved about or\r\nshaken inside the vessel holding it, and no crystallisation will take\r\nplace; the salt remains in the solution in as large an amount as at a\r\nhigher temperature. If the vessel holding the supersaturated solution\r\nbe opened and a crystal of Glauber's salt be thrown in, crystallisation\r\nsuddenly takes place.[55] A considerable rise in temperature is noticed\r\nduring this rapid separation of crystals, which is due to the fact\r\nthat the salt, previously in a liquid state, passes into a solid state.\r\nThis bears some resemblance to the fact that water maybe cooled below\r\n0° (even to -10°) if it be left at rest, under certain circumstances,\r\nand evolves heat in suddenly crystallising. Although from this point\r\nof view there is a resemblance, yet in reality the phenomenon of\r\nsupersaturated solutions is much more complicated. Thus, on cooling,\r\na saturated solution of Glauber's salt deposits crystals containing\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}0,[56] or 126 parts of water per 142 parts of\r\nanhydrous salt, and not 180 parts of water, as in the above-mentioned\r\nsalt. The crystals containing 7H_{2}O are distinguished for their\r\ninstability; if they stand in contact not only with crystals of\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O, but with many other substances, they immediately\r\nbecome opaque, forming a mixture of anhydrous and deca-hydrated salts.\r\nIt is evident that between water and a soluble substance there may be\r\nestablished different kinds of greater or less stable equilibrium, of\r\nwhich solutions form a particular case.[57]\r\n\r\n  [54] Those salts which separate out with water of crystallisation and\r\n       give several crystallohydrates form supersaturated solutions with\r\n       the greatest facility, and the phenomenon is much more common\r\n       than was previously imagined. The first data were given in the\r\n       last century by Loewitz, in St. Petersburg. Numerous researches\r\n       have proved that supersaturated solutions do not differ from\r\n       ordinary solutions in any of their essential properties. The\r\n       variations in specific gravity, vapour tension, formation of ice,\r\n       &c., take place according to the ordinary laws.\r\n\r\n  [55] Inasmuch as air, as has been shown by direct experiment, contains,\r\n       although in very small quantities, minute crystals of salts,\r\n       and among them sodium sulphate, air can bring about the\r\n       crystallisation of a supersaturated solution of sodium sulphate\r\n       in an open vessel, but it has no effect on saturated solutions of\r\n       certain other salts; for example, lead acetate. According to the\r\n       observations of De Boisbaudran, Gernez, and others, isomorphous\r\n       salts (analogous in composition) are capable of inducing\r\n       crystallisation. Thus, a supersaturated solution of nickel\r\n       sulphate crystallises by contact with crystals of sulphates of\r\n       other metals analogous to it, such as those of magnesium, cobalt,\r\n       copper, and manganese. The crystallisation of a supersaturated\r\n       solution, set up by the contact of a minute crystal, starts from\r\n       it in rays with a definite velocity, and it is evident that the\r\n       crystals as they form propagate the crystallisation in definite\r\n       directions. This phenomenon recalls the evolution of organisms\r\n       from germs. An attraction of similar molecules ensues, and they\r\n       dispose themselves in definite similar forms.\r\n\r\n  [56] At the present time a view is very generally accepted, which\r\n       regards supersaturated solutions as homogeneous systems, which\r\n       pass into heterogeneous systems (composed of a liquid and a\r\n       solid substance), in all respects exactly resembling the passage\r\n       of water cooled below its freezing point into ice and water,\r\n       or the passage of crystals of rhombic sulphur into monoclinic\r\n       crystals, and of the monoclinic crystals into rhombic. Although\r\n       many phenomena of supersaturation are thus clearly understood,\r\n       yet the spontaneous formation of the unstable hepta-hydrated salt\r\n       (with 7H_{2}O), in the place of the more stable deca-hydrated\r\n       salt (with mol. 10H_{2}O), indicates a property of a saturated\r\n       solution of sodium sulphate which obliges one to admit that\r\n       it has a different structure from an ordinary solution.\r\n       Stcherbacheff asserts, on the basis of his researches, that\r\n       a solution of the deca-hydrated salt gives, on evaporation,\r\n       without the aid of heat, the deca-hydrated salt, whilst after\r\n       heating above 33° it forms a supersaturated solution and the\r\n       hepta-hydrated salt. But in order that this view should be\r\n       accepted, some facts must be discovered distinguishing solutions\r\n       (which are, according to this view, isomeric) containing the\r\n       hepta-hydrated salt from those containing the deca-hydrated\r\n       salt, and all efforts in this direction (the study of the\r\n       properties of the solutions) have given negative results. As\r\n       some crystallohydrates of salts (alums, sugar of lead, calcium\r\n       chloride) melt straightway (without separating out anything),\r\n       whilst others (like Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O) are broken up, then\r\n       it may be that the latter are only in a state of equilibrium at\r\n       a higher temperature than their melting point. It may here be\r\n       observed that in melting crystals of the deca-hydrated salt,\r\n       there is formed, besides the solid anhydrous salt, a saturated\r\n       solution giving the hepta-hydrated salt, so that this passage\r\n       from the deca-to the hepta-hydrated salt, and the reverse,\r\n       takes place with the formation of the anhydrous (or, it may be,\r\n       monohydrated) salt.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, supersaturation (Potilitzin, 1889) only takes\r\n       place with those substances which are capable of giving\r\n       several modifications or several crystallohydrates, _i.e._\r\n       supersaturated solutions separate out, besides the stable normal\r\n       crystallohydrate, hydrates containing less water and also the\r\n       anhydrous salt. This degree of saturation acts upon the substance\r\n       dissolved in a like manner to heat. Sulphate of nickel in a\r\n       solution at 15° to 20° separates out rhombic crystals with\r\n       7H_{2}O, at 30° to 40° cubical crystals, with 6H_{2}O, at 50° to\r\n       70° monoclinic crystals, also containing 6H_{2}O. Crystals of\r\n       the same composition separate out from supersaturated solutions\r\n       at one temperature (17° to 19°), but at different degrees of\r\n       saturation, as was shown by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. The capacity\r\n       to voluntarily separate out slightly hydrated or anhydrous salts\r\n       by the introduction of a crystal into the solution is common to\r\n       all supersaturated solutions. If a salt forms a supersaturated\r\n       solution, then one would expect, according to this view, that\r\n       it should exist in the form of several hydrates or in several\r\n       modifications. Thus Potilitzin concluded that chlorate of\r\n       strontium, which easily gives supersaturated solutions, should\r\n       be capable of forming several hydrates, besides the anhydrous\r\n       salt known; and he succeeded in discovering the existence\r\n       of two hydrates, Sr(ClO_{3})_{2},3H_{2}O and apparently\r\n       Sr(ClO_{3})_{2},8H_{2}O. Besides this, three modifications of the\r\n       common anhydrous salt were obtained, differing from each other\r\n       in their crystalline form. One modification separated out in the\r\n       form of rhombic octahedra, another in oblique plates, and a third\r\n       in long brittle prisms or plates. Further researches showed that\r\n       salts which are not capable of forming supersaturated solutions\r\n       such as the bromates of calcium, strontium, and barium, part\r\n       with their water of hydration with difficulty (they crystallise\r\n       with 1H_{2}O), and decompose very slowly in a vacuum or in dry\r\n       air. In other words the tension of dissociation is very small\r\n       in this class of hydrates. As the hydrates characterised by a\r\n       small dissociation tension are incapable of giving supersaturated\r\n       solutions, so conversely supersaturated solutions give hydrates\r\n       whose tension of dissociation is great (Potilitzin, 1893).\r\n\r\n  [57] _Emulsions_, like milk, are composed of a solution of glutinous\r\n       or similar substances, or of oily liquids suspended in a\r\n       liquid in the form of drops, which are clearly visible under a\r\n       microscope, and form an example of a mechanical formation which\r\n       resembles solution. But the difference from solutions is here\r\n       evident. There are, however, solutions which approach very near\r\n       to emulsions in the facility with which the substance dissolved\r\n       separates from them. It has long been known, for example, that\r\n       a particular kind of Prussian blue, KFe_{2}(CN)_{6}, dissolves\r\n       in pure water, but, on the addition of the smallest quantity\r\n       of either of a number of salts, it coagulates and becomes\r\n       quite insoluble. If copper sulphide (CuS), cadmium sulphide\r\n       (CdS), arsenic sulphide (As_{2}S_{5}) (the experiments with\r\n       these substances proceed with great ease, and the solution\r\n       obtained is comparatively stable), and many other metallic\r\n       sulphides, be obtained by a method of double decomposition (by\r\n       precipitating salts of these metals by hydrogen sulphide),\r\n       and be then carefully washed (by allowing the precipitate to\r\n       settle, pouring off the liquid, and again adding sulphuretted\r\n       hydrogen water), then, as was shown by Schulze, Spring, Prost,\r\n       and others, the previously insoluble sulphides pass into\r\n       transparent (for mercury, lead, and silver, reddish brown; for\r\n       copper and iron, greenish brown; for cadmium and indium, yellow;\r\n       and for zinc, colourless) solutions, which may be preserved\r\n       (the weaker they are the longer they keep) and even boiled, but\r\n       which, nevertheless, in time coagulate--that is, separate in an\r\n       insoluble form, and then sometimes become crystalline and quite\r\n       incapable of re-dissolving. Graham and others observed the power\r\n       shown by colloids (_see_ note 18) of forming similar _hydrosols\r\n       or solutions of gelatinous colloids_, and, in describing alumina\r\n       and silica, we shall again have occasion to speak of such\r\n       solutions.\r\n\r\n       In the existing state of our knowledge concerning solution, such\r\n       solutions may be looked on as a transition between emulsion and\r\n       ordinary solutions, but no fundamental judgment can be formed\r\n       about them until a study has been made of their relations to\r\n       ordinary solutions (the solutions of even soluble colloids freeze\r\n       immediately on cooling below 0°, and, according to Guthrie, do\r\n       not form cryohydrates), and to supersaturated solutions, with\r\n       which they have certain points in common.\r\n\r\nSolutions of salts on refrigeration below 0° deposit ice or crystals\r\n(which then frequently contain water of crystallisation) of the salt\r\ndissolved, and on reaching a certain degree of concentration they\r\nsolidify in their entire mass. These solidified masses are termed\r\n_cryohydrates_. My researches on solutions of common salt (1868) showed\r\nthat its solution solidifies when it reaches a composition NaCl +\r\n10H_{2}O (180 parts of water per 58·5 parts of salt), which takes place\r\nat about -23°. The solidified solution melts at the same temperature,\r\nand both the portion melted and the remainder preserve the above\r\ncomposition. Guthrie (1874-1876) obtained the cryohydrates of many\r\nsalts, and he showed that certain of them are formed like the above at\r\ncomparatively low temperatures, whilst others (for instance, corrosive\r\nsublimate, alums, potassium chlorate, and various colloids) are formed\r\non a slight cooling, to -2° or even before.[58] In the case of common\r\nsalt, the cryohydrate with 10 molecules of water, and in the case of\r\nsodium nitrate, the cryohydrate[59] with 7 molecules of water (_i.e._\r\n126 parts of water per 85 of salt) should be accepted as established\r\nsubstances, capable of passing from a solid to a liquid state and\r\nconversely; and therefore it may be thought that in cryohydrates we\r\nhave solutions which are not only undecomposable by cold, but also have\r\na definite composition which would present a fresh case of definite\r\nequilibrium between the solvent and the substance dissolved.\r\n\r\n  [58] Offer (1880) concludes, from his researches on cryohydrates, that\r\n       they are simple mixtures of ice and salts, having a constant\r\n       melting point, just as there are alloys having a constant point\r\n       of fusion, and solutions of liquids with a constant boiling point\r\n       (_see_ note 60). This does not, however, explain in what form\r\n       a salt is contained, for instance, in the cryohydrate NaCl +\r\n       10H_{2}O. At temperatures above -10° common salt separates out in\r\n       anhydrous crystals, and at temperatures near -10°, in combination\r\n       with water of crystallisation, NaCl + 2H_{2}O, and, therefore,\r\n       it is very improbable that at still lower temperatures it would\r\n       separate without water. If the possibility of the solidified\r\n       cryohydrate containing NaCl + 2H_{2}O and ice be admitted, then\r\n       it is not clear why one of these substances does not melt before\r\n       the other. If alcohol does not extract water from the solid mass,\r\n       leaving the salt behind, this does not prove the presence of ice,\r\n       because alcohol also takes up water from the crystals of many\r\n       hydrated substances (for instance, from NaCl + 2H_{2}O) at about\r\n       their melting-points. Besides which, a simple observation on the\r\n       cryohydrate, NaCl + 10H_{2}O, shows that with the most careful\r\n       cooling it does not on the addition of ice deposit ice, which\r\n       would occur if ice were formed on solidification intermixed with\r\n       the salt.\r\n\r\n       I may add with regard to cryohydrates that many of the solutions\r\n       of acids solidify completely on prolonged cooling (for example,\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O), and then form perfectly definite compounds.\r\n       For the solutions of sulphuric acid (_see_ Chapter XX.)\r\n       Pickering obtained, for instance, a hydrate, H_{2}SO_{4},4H_{2}O\r\n       at -25°. Hydrochloric, nitric, and other acids also give similar\r\n       crystalline hydrates, melting at low temperatures and presenting\r\n       many similarities with the cryohydrates.\r\n\r\n  [59] _See_ note 24.\r\n\r\nThe formation of definite but unstable compounds in the process of\r\nsolution becomes evident from the phenomena of a marked decrease of\r\nvapour tension, or from the rise of the temperature of ebullition which\r\noccurs in the solution of certain volatile liquids and gases in water.\r\nAs an example, we will take hydriodic acid, HI, a gas which liquefies,\r\ngiving a liquid which boils at -20°. A solution of it containing 57 p.c.\r\nof hydriodic acid is distinguished by the fact that if it be heated\r\nthe hydriodic acid volatilises together with the water in the same\r\nproportions as they occur in the solution, therefore such a solution\r\nmay be distilled unchanged. The solution boils at a higher temperature\r\nthan water, at 127°. A portion of the physical properties of the gas\r\nand water have in this case already disappeared--a new substance is\r\nformed, which has its definite boiling point. To put it more correctly,\r\nthis is not the temperature of ebullition, but the temperature at which\r\nthe compound formed decomposes, forming the vapours of the products of\r\ndissociation, which, on cooling, re-combine. Should a less amount of\r\nhydriodic acid be dissolved in water than the above, then, on heating\r\nsuch a solution, water only at first distils over, until the solution\r\nattains the above-mentioned composition; it will then distil over\r\nunaltered. If more hydriodic acid be passed into such a solution a fresh\r\nquantity of the gas will dissolve, but it passes off with great ease,\r\nlike air from water. It must not, however, be thought that those forces\r\nwhich determine the formation of ordinary gaseous solutions play no part\r\nwhatever in the formation of a solution having a definite boiling point;\r\nthat they do react is shown from the fact that such constant gaseous\r\nsolutions vary in their composition under different pressures.[60] It\r\nis not, therefore, at every, but only at the ordinary, atmospheric\r\npressure that a constant boiling solution of hydriodic acid will contain\r\n57 p.c. of the gas. At another pressure the proportion of water and\r\nhydriodic acid will be different. It varies, however, judging from\r\nobservations made by Roscoe, very little for considerable variations of\r\npressure. This variation in composition directly indicates that pressure\r\nexerts an influence on the formation of unstable chemical compounds\r\nwhich are easily dissociated (with formation of a gas), just as it\r\ninfluences the solution of gases, only the latter is influenced to a\r\nmore considerable degree than the former.[61] Hydrochloric, nitric, and\r\nother acids form _solutions having definite boiling points_, like that\r\nof hydriodic acid. They show further the common property, if containing\r\nbut a small proportion of water, that they _fume in air_. Strong\r\nsolutions of nitric, hydrochloric, hydriodic, and other gases are even\r\ntermed 'fuming acids.' The fuming liquids contain a definite compound\r\nwhose temperature of ebullition (decomposition) is higher than 100°,\r\nand contain also an excess of the volatile substance dissolved, which\r\nexhibits a capacity to combine with water and form a hydrate, whose\r\nvapour tension is less than that of aqueous vapour. On evaporating in\r\nair, this dissolved substance meets the atmospheric moisture and forms\r\na visible vapour (fumes) with it, which consists of the above-mentioned\r\ncompound. The attraction or affinity which binds, for instance,\r\nhydriodic acid with water is evinced not only in the evolution of heat\r\nand the diminution of vapour tension (rise of boiling point), but also\r\nin many purely chemical relations. Thus hydriodic acid is produced from\r\niodine and hydrogen sulphide in the presence of water, but unless water\r\nis present this reaction does not take place.[62]\r\n\r\n  [60] For this reason (the want of entire constancy of the composition\r\n       of constant boiling solutions with a change of pressure), the\r\n       existence of definite hydrates formed by volatile substances--for\r\n       instance, by hydrochloric acid and water--is frequently denied.\r\n       It is generally argued as follows: If there did exist a constancy\r\n       of composition, then it would be unaltered by a change of\r\n       pressure. But the distillation of constant boiling hydrates\r\n       is undoubtedly accompanied (judging by the vapour densities\r\n       determined by Bineau), like the distillation of sal ammoniac,\r\n       sulphuric acid, &c., by a complete decomposition of the original\r\n       compound--that is, these substances do not exist in a state\r\n       of vapour, but their products of decomposition (hydrochloric\r\n       acid and water) are gases at the temperature of volatilisation,\r\n       which dissolve in the volatilised and condensed liquids; but\r\n       the solubility of gases in liquids depends on the pressure,\r\n       and, therefore, the composition of constant boiling solutions\r\n       may, and even ought to, vary with a change of pressure, and,\r\n       further, the smaller the pressure and the lower the temperature\r\n       of volatilisation, the more likely is a true compound to be\r\n       obtained. According to the researches of Roscoe and Dittmar\r\n       (1859), the constant boiling solution of hydrochloric acid\r\n       proved to contain 18 p.c. of hydrochloric acid at a pressure of\r\n       3 atmospheres, 20 p.c. at 1 atmosphere, and 23 p.c. at 1/10 of\r\n       an atmosphere. On passing air through the solution until its\r\n       composition became constant (_i.e._ forcing the excess of aqueous\r\n       vapour or of hydrochloric acid to pass away with the air),\r\n       then acid was obtained containing about 20 p.c. at 100°, about\r\n       23 p.c. at 50°, and about 25 p.c. at 0°. From this it is seen\r\n       that by decreasing the pressure and lowering the temperature of\r\n       evaporation one arrives at the same limit, where the composition\r\n       should be taken as HCl + 6H_{2}O, which requires 25·26 p.c. of\r\n       hydrochloric acid. Fuming hydrochloric acid contains more than\r\n       this.\r\n\r\n       In the case already considered, as in the case of formic acid\r\n       in the researches of D. P. Konovaloff (note 47), the constant\r\n       boiling solution corresponds with a minimum tension--that\r\n       is, with a boiling point higher than that of either of the\r\n       component elements. But there is another case of constant boiling\r\n       solutions similar to the case of the solution of propyl alcohol,\r\n       C_{3}H_{8}O, when a solution, undecomposed by distillation, boils\r\n       at a lower point than that of the more volatile liquid. However,\r\n       in this case also, if there be solution, the possibility of the\r\n       formation of a definite compound in the form C_{3}H_{8}O + H_{2}O\r\n       cannot be denied, and the tension of the solution is not equal to\r\n       the sum of tensions of the components. There are possible cases\r\n       of constant boiling mixtures even when there is no solution nor\r\n       any loss of tension, and consequently no chemical action, since\r\n       the amount of liquids that are volatilised is determined by\r\n       the product of the vapour densities into their vapour tensions\r\n       (Wanklyn), in consequence of which liquids whose boiling point\r\n       is above 100°--for instance, turpentine and ethereal oils in\r\n       general--when distilled with aqueous vapour, pass over at a\r\n       temperature below 100°. Consequently, it is not in the constancy\r\n       of composition and boiling point (temperature of decomposition)\r\n       that evidence of a distinct chemical action is to be found in\r\n       the above-described solutions of acids, but in the great loss\r\n       of tension, which completely resembles the loss of tension\r\n       observed, for instance, in the perfectly-definite combinations of\r\n       substances with water of crystallisation (see later, note 65).\r\n       Sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, as we shall learn later, is also\r\n       decomposed by distillation, like HCl + 6H_{2}O, and exhibits,\r\n       moreover, all the signs of a definite chemical compound. The\r\n       study of the variation of the specific gravities of solutions as\r\n       dependent on their composition (see note 19) shows that phenomena\r\n       of a similar kind, although of different dimensions, take place\r\n       in the formation of both H_{2}SO_{4} from H_{2}O and SO_{3}, and\r\n       of HCl + 6H_{2}O (or of aqueous solutions analogous to it) from\r\n       HCl and H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [61] The essence of the matter may he thus represented. A gaseous or\r\n       easily volatile substance _A_ forms with a certain quantity of\r\n       water, _n_H_{2}O, a definite complex compound _An_H_{2}O, which\r\n       is stable up to a temperature t° higher than 100°. At this\r\n       temperature it is decomposed into two substances, _A_ + H_{2}O.\r\n       Both boil below _t_° at the ordinary pressure, and therefore at\r\n       _t_° they distil over and re-combine in the receiver. But if a\r\n       part of the substance _An_H_{2}O is decomposed or volatilised,\r\n       a portion of the undecomposed liquid still remains in the\r\n       vessel, which can partially dissolve one of the products of\r\n       decomposition, and that in quantity varying with the pressure and\r\n       temperature, and therefore the solution at a constant boiling\r\n       point will have a slightly different composition at different\r\n       pressures.\r\n\r\n  [62] For solutions of hydrochloric acid in water there are still greater\r\n       differences in reactions. For instance, strong solutions\r\n       decompose antimony sulphide (forming hydrogen sulphide, H_{2}S),\r\n       and precipitate common salt from its solutions, whilst weak\r\n       solutions do not act thus.\r\n\r\nMany compunds containing water of crystallisation are solid substances\r\n(when melted they are already solutions--_i.e._ liquids); furthermore,\r\nthey are capable of being formed from solutions, like ice or aqueous\r\nvapour. They may be called _crystallo-hydrates_. Inasmuch as the direct\r\npresence of ice or aqueous vapour cannot be admitted in solutions\r\n(for these are liquids), although the presence of water may be, so\r\nalso there is no basis for acknowledging the presence in solutions\r\nof crystallo-hydrates, although they are obtained from solutions as\r\nsuch.[63] It is evident that such substances present one of the many\r\nforms of equilibrium between water and a substance dissolved in it.\r\nThis form, however, reminds one, in all respects, of solutions--that\r\nis, aqueous compounds which are more or less easily decomposed, with\r\nseparation of water and the formation of a less aqueous or an anhydrous\r\ncompound. In fact, there are not a few crystals containing water which\r\nlose a part of their water at the ordinary temperature. Of such a kind,\r\nfor instance, are the crystals of soda, or sodium carbonate, which,\r\nwhen separated from an aqueous solution at the ordinary temperature,\r\nare quite transparent; but when left exposed to air, lose a portion\r\nof their water, becoming opaque, and, in the process, lose their\r\ncrystalline appearance, although preserving their original form.\r\nThis process of the separation of water at the ordinary temperature\r\nis termed the _efflorescence_ of crystals. Efflorescence takes place\r\nmore rapidly under the receiver of an air pump, and especially at a\r\ngentle heat. This breaking up of a crystal is dissociation at the\r\nordinary temperature. Solutions are decomposed in exactly the same\r\nmanner.[64] The tension of the aqueous vapour which is given off\r\nfrom crystallo-hydrates is naturally, as with solutions, less than\r\nthe vapour tension of water itself[65] at the same temperature, and\r\ntherefore many anhydrous salts which are capable of combining with\r\nwater absorb aqueous vapour from moist air; that is, they act like a\r\ncold body on which water is deposited from steam. It is on this that\r\nthe desiccation of gases is based, and it must further be remarked in\r\nthis respect that certain substances--for instance, potassium carbonate\r\n(K_{2}CO_{3}) and calcium chloride (CaCl_{2})--not only absorb the water\r\nnecessary for the formation of a solid crystalline compound, but also\r\ngive solutions, or _deliquesce_, as it is termed, in moist air. Many\r\ncrystals do not effloresce in the least at the ordinary temperature;\r\nfor example, copper sulphate, which may be preserved for an indefinite\r\nlength of time without efflorescing, but when placed under the receiver\r\nof an air pump, if efflorescence be once started, it goes on at the\r\nordinary temperature. The temperature at which the complete separation\r\nof water from crystals takes place varies considerably, not only for\r\ndifferent substances, but also for different portions of the contained\r\nwater. Very often the temperature at which dissociation begins is very\r\nmuch higher than the boiling point of water. So, for example, copper\r\nsulphate, which contains 36 p.c. of water, gives up 28·8 p.c. at 100°,\r\nand the remaining quantity, namely 7·2 p.c., only at 240°. Alum, out of\r\nthe 45·5 p.c. of water which it contains, gives up 18·9 p.c. at 100°,\r\n17·7 p.c. at 120°, 7·7 p.c. at 180°, and 1 p.c. at 280°; it only loses\r\nthe last quantity (1 p.c.) at its temperature of decomposition. These\r\nexamples clearly show that the annexation of water of crystallisation\r\nis accompanied by a rather profound, although, in comparison with\r\ninstances which we shall consider later, still inconsiderable, change\r\nof its properties. In certain cases the water of crystallisation is\r\nonly given off when the solid form of the substance is destroyed: when\r\nthe crystals melt on heating. The crystals are then said _to melt in\r\ntheir water of crystallisation_. Further, after the separation of the\r\nwater, a solid substance remains behind, so that by further heating it\r\nacquires a solid form. This is seen most clearly in crystals of sugar of\r\nlead or lead acetate, which melt in their water of crystallisation at a\r\ntemperature of 56·25°, and in so doing begin to lose water. On reaching\r\na temperature of 100° the sugar of lead solidifies, having lost all its\r\nwater; and then at a temperature of 280°, the anhydrous and solidified\r\nsalt again melts.[65 bis]\r\n\r\n  [63] Supersaturated solutions give an excellent proof in this respect.\r\n       Thus a solution of copper sulphate generally crystallises in\r\n       penta-hydrated crystals, CuSO_{4} + 5H_{2}O, and its saturated\r\n       solution gives such crystals if it be brought into contact with\r\n       the minutest possible crystal of the same kind. But, according\r\n       to the observations of Lecoq de Boisbaudran, if a crystal of\r\n       ferrous sulphate (an isomorphous salt, _see_ note 55), FeSO_{4}\r\n       + 7H_{2}O, be placed in a saturated solution of copper sulphate,\r\n       then crystals of hepta-hydrated salt, CuSO_{4} + 7H_{2}O,\r\n       are obtained. It is evident that neither the penta-nor the\r\n       hepta-hydrated salt is contained as such in the solution. The\r\n       solution presents its own particular liquid form of equilibrium.\r\n\r\n  [64] Efflorescence, like every evaporation, proceeds from the surface.\r\n       In the interior of crystals which have effloresced there is\r\n       usually found a non-effloresced mass, so that the majority of\r\n       effloresced crystals of washing soda show, in their fracture, a\r\n       transparent nucleus coated by an effloresced, opaque, powdery\r\n       mass. It is a remarkable circumstance in this respect that\r\n       efflorescence proceeds in a completely regular and uniform\r\n       manner, so that the angles and planes of similar crystallographic\r\n       character effloresce simultaneously, and in this respect the\r\n       crystalline form determines those parts of crystals where\r\n       efflorescence starts, and the order in which it continues. In\r\n       solutions evaporation also proceeds from the surface, and the\r\n       first crystals which appear on its reaching the required degree\r\n       of saturation are also formed at the surface. After falling to\r\n       the bottom the crystals naturally continue to grow (_see_ Chapter\r\n       X.).\r\n\r\n  [65] According to Lesc[oe]ur (1883), at 100° a concentrated solution of\r\n       barium hydroxide, BaH_{2}O_{2}, on first depositing crystals\r\n       (with + H_{2}O) has a tension of about 630 mm. (instead of\r\n       760 mm., the tension of water), which decreases (because the\r\n       solution evaporates) to 45 mm., when all the water is expelled\r\n       from the crystals, BaH_{2}O_{2} + H_{2}O, which are formed, but\r\n       they also lose water (dissociate, effloresce at 100°), leaving\r\n       the hydroxide, BaH_{2}O_{2}, which is perfectly undecomposable\r\n       at 100°--that is, does not part with water. At 73° (the tension\r\n       of water is then 265 mm.) a solution, containing 33H_{2}O,\r\n       on crystallising has a tension of 230 mm.; the crystals,\r\n       BaH_{2}O_{2} + 8H_{2}O, which separate out, have a tension of\r\n       160 mm.; on losing water they give BaH_{2}O_{2} + H_{2}O. This\r\n       substance does not decompose at 73°, and therefore its tension =\r\n       0. In those crystallohydrates which effloresce at the ordinary\r\n       temperature, the tension of dissociation nearly approximates\r\n       to that of the aqueous vapour, as Lesc[oe]ur (1891) showed. To\r\n       this category of compounds belong B_{2}O_{3}(3 + _x_)H_{2}O,\r\n       C_{2}O_{4}H_{2}(2 + _x_)H_{2}O, BaO(9 + _x_)H_{2}O, and SrO(9\r\n       + _x_)H_{2}O. And a still greater tension is possessed by\r\n       Na_{2}SO_{4}10H_{2}O, Na_{2}CO_{3}10H_{2}O, and MgSO_{4}(7 +\r\n       _x_)H_{2}O. Müller-Erzbach (1884) determines the tension (with\r\n       reference to liquid water) by placing tubes of the same length\r\n       with water and the substances experimented with in a desiccator,\r\n       the rate of loss of water giving the relative tension. Thus,\r\n       at the ordinary temperature, crystals of sodium phosphate,\r\n       Na_{2}HPO_{4} + 12H_{2}O, present a tension of 0·7 compared\r\n       with water, until they lose 5H_{2}O, then 0·4 until they lose\r\n       5H_{2}O more, and on losing the last equivalent of water the\r\n       tension falls to 0·04 compared with water. It is clear that\r\n       the different molecules of water are held by an unequal force.\r\n       Out of the five molecules of water in copper sulphate the two\r\n       first are comparatively easily separated even at the ordinary\r\n       temperature (but only after several days in a desiccator,\r\n       according to Latchinoff); the next two are more difficultly\r\n       separated, and the last equivalent is retained even at 100°. This\r\n       is another indication of the capacity of CuSO_{4} to form three\r\n       hydrates, CuSO_{4}5H_{2}O, CuSO_{4}3H_{2}O, and CuSO_{4}H_{2}O.\r\n       The researches of Andreae on the tension of dissociation of\r\n       hydrated sulphate of copper showed (1891) the existence of three\r\n       provinces, characterised at a given temperature by a constant\r\n       tension: (1) between 3-5, (2) between 1-3, and lastly (3) between\r\n       0-1 molecule of water, which again confirms the existence of\r\n       three hydrates of the above composition for this salt.\r\n\r\n  [65 bis] Sodium acetate (C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}Na,3H_{2}O) melts at 58°, but\r\n       re-solidifies only on contact with a crystal, otherwise it\r\n       may remain liquid even at 0°, and may be used for obtaining a\r\n       constant temperature. According to Jeannel, the latent heat\r\n       of fusion is about 28 calories, and according to Pickering\r\n       the heat of solution 35 calories. When melted this salt boils\r\n       at 123°--that is, the tension of the vapour given off at that\r\n       temperature equals the atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is most important to recognise in respect to the water of\r\ncrystallisation that its ratio to the quantity of the substance with\r\nwhich it is combined is always a constant quantity. However often we\r\nmay prepare copper sulphate, we shall always find 36·14 p.c. of water\r\nin its crystals, and these crystals always lose four-fifths of their\r\nwater at 100°, and one-fifth of the whole amount of the water contained\r\nremains in the crystals at 100°, and is only expelled from them at a\r\ntemperature of about 240°. What has been said about crystals of copper\r\nsulphate refers also to crystals of every other substance, which contain\r\nwater of crystallisation. It is impossible in any of these cases to\r\nincrease either the relative proportion of the salt or of the water,\r\nwithout changing the homogeneity of the substance. If once a portion of\r\nthe water be lost--for instance, if once efflorescence takes place--a\r\nmixture is obtained, and not a homogeneous substance, namely a mixture\r\nof a substance deprived of water with a substance which has not yet lost\r\nwater--_i.e._ decomposition has already commenced. This constant ratio\r\nis an example of the fact that in chemical compounds the quantity of\r\nthe component parts is quite definite; that is, it is an example of the\r\nso-called _definite chemical compounds_. They may be distinguished from\r\nsolutions, and from all other so-called indefinite chemical compounds,\r\nin that at least one, and sometimes both, of the component parts may be\r\nadded in a large quantity to an indefinite chemical compound, without\r\ndestroying its homogeneity, as in solutions, whilst it is impossible\r\nto add any one of the component parts to a definite chemical compound\r\nwithout destroying the homogeneity of the entire mass. Definite\r\nchemical compounds only decompose at a certain rise in temperature;\r\non a lowering in temperature they do not, at least with very few\r\nexceptions, yield their components like solutions which form ice or\r\ncompounds with water of crystallisation. This leads to the assumption\r\nthat solutions contain water as water,[66] although it may sometimes\r\nbe in a very small quantity. Therefore solutions which are capable\r\nof solidifying completely (for instance, crystallo-hydrates capable\r\nof melting) such as the compound of 84-1/2 parts of sulphuric acid,\r\nH_{2}SO_{4}, with 15-1/2 parts of water, H_{2}O, or H_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O\r\n(or H_{4}SO_{5}), appear as true definite chemical compounds. If,\r\nthen, we imagine such a definite compound in a liquid state, and admit\r\nthat it partially decomposes in this state, separating water--not as\r\nice or vapour (for then the system would be heterogeneous, including\r\nsubstances in different physical states), but in a liquid form, when\r\nthe system will be homogeneous--we shall form an idea of a solution as\r\nan unstable, dissociating fluid state of equilibrium between water and\r\nthe substance dissolved. Moreover, it should be remarked that, judging\r\nby experiment, many substances give with water not one but _diverse_\r\ncompounds,[67] which is seen in the capacity of one substance to form\r\nwith water many various _crystallo-hydrates_, or compounds with water\r\nof crystallisation, showing diverse and independent properties. From\r\nthese considerations, _solutions[68] may be regarded as fluid, unstable,\r\ndefinite chemical compounds in a state of dissociation_.[69]\r\n\r\n  [66] Such a phenomenon frequently presents itself in purely chemical\r\n       action. For instance, let a liquid substance _A_ give, with\r\n       another liquid substance _B_, under the conditions of an\r\n       experiment, a mere minute quantity of a solid or gaseous\r\n       substance _C_. This small quantity will separate out (pass\r\n       away from the sphere of action, as Berthollet expressed it),\r\n       and the remaining masses of _A_ and _B_ will again give _C_;\r\n       consequently, under these conditions action will go on to the\r\n       end. Such, it seems to me, is the action in solutions when they\r\n       yield ice or vapour indicating the presence of water.\r\n\r\n  [67] Certain substances are capable of forming together only one\r\n       compound, others several, and these of the most varied degrees\r\n       of stability. The compounds of water are instances of this\r\n       kind. In solutions the existence of several different definite\r\n       compounds must be acknowledged, but many of these have not\r\n       yet been obtained in a free state, and it may be that they\r\n       cannot be obtained in any other but a liquid form--that is,\r\n       dissolved; just as there are many undoubted definite compounds\r\n       which only exist in one physical state. Among the hydrates such\r\n       instances occur. The compound CO_{2} + 8H_{2}O (_see_ note\r\n       31), according to Wroblewski, only occurs in a solid form.\r\n       Hydrates like H_{2}S + 12H_{2}O (De Forcrand and Villard), HBr\r\n       + H_{2}O (Roozeboom), can only be accepted on the basis of a\r\n       decrease of tension, but present themselves as very transient\r\n       substances, incapable of existing in a stable free state.\r\n       Even sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, itself, which undoubtedly\r\n       is a definite compound, fumes in a liquid form, giving off\r\n       the anhydride, SO_{3}--that is, it exhibits a very unstable\r\n       equilibrium. The crystallo-hydrates of chlorine, Cl_{2} +\r\n       8H_{2}O, of hydrogen sulphide, H_{2}S + 12H_{2}O (it is formed\r\n       at 0°, and is completely decomposed at +1°, as then 1 vol. of\r\n       water only dissolves 4 vols. of hydrogen sulphide, while at 0·1°\r\n       it dissolves about 100 vols.), and of many other gases, are\r\n       instances of hydrates which are very unstable.\r\n\r\n  [68] Of such a kind are also other indefinite chemical compounds; for\r\n       example, metallic alloys. These are solid substances or\r\n       solidified solutions of metals. They also contain definite\r\n       compounds, and may contain an excess of one of the metals.\r\n       According to the experiments of Laurie (1888), the alloys of zinc\r\n       with copper in respect to the electro-motive force in galvanic\r\n       batteries behave just like zinc if the proportion of copper in\r\n       the alloy does not exceed a certain percentage--that is, until\r\n       a definite compound is attained--for in that case particles of\r\n       free zinc are present; but if a copper surface be taken, and it\r\n       be covered by only one-thousandth part of its area of zinc, then\r\n       only the zinc will act in a galvanic battery.\r\n\r\n  [69] According to the above supposition, the condition of solutions\r\n       in the sense of the kinetic hypothesis of matter (that is, on\r\n       the supposition of an internal motion of molecules and atoms)\r\n       may be represented in the following form:--In a homogeneous\r\n       liquid--for instance, water--the molecules occur in a certain\r\n       state of, although mobile, still stable, equilibrium. When a\r\n       substance _A_ dissolves in water, its molecules form with several\r\n       molecules of water, systems _An_H_{2}O, which are so unstable\r\n       that when surrounded by molecules of water they decompose and\r\n       re-form, so that _A_ passes from one mass of molecules of water\r\n       to another, and the molecules of water which were at this\r\n       moment in harmonious motion with _A_ in the form of the system\r\n       _An_H_{2}O, in the next instant may have already succeeded in\r\n       getting free. The addition of water or of molecules of _A_\r\n       may either only alter the number of free molecules, which in\r\n       their turn enter into systems _An_H_{2}O, or they may introduce\r\n       conditions for the possibility of building up new systems\r\n       _Am_H_{2}O, where _m_ is either greater or less than _n_. If\r\n       in the solution the relation of the molecules be the same as\r\n       in the system _Am_H_{2}O, then the addition of fresh molecules\r\n       of water or of _A_ would be followed by the formation of new\r\n       molecules _An_H_{2}O. The relative quantity, stability, and\r\n       composition of these systems or definite compounds will vary in\r\n       one or another solution. I adopted this view of solutions (1887,\r\n       Pickering subsequently put forward a similar view) after a most\r\n       intimate study of the variation of their specific gravities, to\r\n       which my book, cited in note 19, is devoted. Definite compounds,\r\n       _An__{1}H_{2}O and _Am__{1}H_{2}O, existing in a free--for\r\n       instance, solid--form, may in certain cases be held in solutions\r\n       in a dissociated state (although but partially); they are similar\r\n       in their structure to those definite substances which are formed\r\n       in solutions, but it is not necessary to assume that such\r\n       systems as Na_{2}SO_{4} + 10H_{2}O, or Na_{2}SO_{4} + 7H_{2}O,\r\n       or Na_{2}SO_{4}, are contained in solutions. The comparatively\r\n       more stable systems _An__{1}H_{2}O which exist in a free state\r\n       and change their physical state must present, although within\r\n       certain limits of temperature, an entirely harmonious kind of\r\n       motion of _A_ with _n__{1}H_{2}O; the property also and state of\r\n       systems _An_H_{2}O and _Am_H_{2}O, occurring in solutions, is\r\n       that they are in a liquid form, although partially dissociated.\r\n       Substances _A__{1}, which give solutions, are distinguished by\r\n       the fact that they can form such unstable systems _An_H_{2}O,\r\n       but besides them they can give other much more stable systems\r\n       _An__{1}H_{2}O. Thus ethylene, C_{2}H_{4}, in dissolving in\r\n       water, probably forms a system C_{2}H_{4}_n_H_{2}O, which easily\r\n       splits up into C_{2}H_{4} and H_{2}O, but it also gives the\r\n       system of alcohol, C_{2}H_{4},H_{2}O or C_{2}H_{6}O, which is\r\n       comparatively stable. Thus oxygen can dissolve in water, and it\r\n       can combine with it, forming peroxide of hydrogen. Turpentine,\r\n       C_{10}H_{16}, does not dissolve in water, but it combines with it\r\n       as a comparatively stable hydrate. In other words, the chemical\r\n       structure of hydrates, or of the definite compounds which are\r\n       contained in solutions, is distinguished not only by its original\r\n       peculiarities but also by a diversity of stability. A similar\r\n       structure to hydrates must be acknowledged in crystallo-hydrates.\r\n       On melting they give actual (real) solutions. As substances which\r\n       give crystallo-hydrates, like salts, are capable of forming a\r\n       number of diverse hydrates, and as the greater the number of\r\n       molecules of water (_n_) they (_An_H_{2}O) contain, the lower\r\n       is the temperature of their formation, and as the more easily\r\n       they decompose the more water they hold, therefore, in the first\r\n       place, the isolation of hydrates holding much water existing in\r\n       aqueous solutions may be soonest looked for at low temperatures\r\n       (although, perhaps, in certain cases they cannot exist in the\r\n       solid state); and, secondly, the stability also of such higher\r\n       hydrates will be at a minimum under the ordinary circumstances\r\n       of the occurrence of liquid water. Hence a further more detailed\r\n       investigation of cryohydrates may help to the elucidation of\r\n       the nature of solutions. But it may be foreseen that certain\r\n       cryohydrates will, like metallic alloys, present solidified\r\n       mixtures of ice with the salts themselves and their more stable\r\n       hydrates, and others will be definite compounds.\r\n\r\nIn regarding solutions from this point of view they come under the head\r\nof those definite compounds with which chemistry is mainly concerned.[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] The above representation of solutions, &c., considering them as\r\n       a particular state of definite compounds, excludes the\r\n       independent existence of indefinite compounds; by this means that\r\n       unity of chemical conception is obtained which cannot be arrived\r\n       at by admitting the physico-mechanical conception of indefinite\r\n       compounds. The gradual transition from typical solutions (as\r\n       of gases in water, and of weak saline solutions) to sulphuric\r\n       acid, and from it and its definite, but yet unstable and liquid,\r\n       compounds, to clearly defined compounds, such as salts and their\r\n       crystallo-hydrates, is so imperceptible, that in denying that\r\n       solutions pertain to the number of definite but dissociating\r\n       compounds, we risk denying the definiteness of the atomic\r\n       composition of such substances as sulphuric acid or of molten\r\n       crystallo-hydrates. I repeat, however, that for the present the\r\n       theory of solutions cannot be considered as firmly established.\r\n       The above opinion about them is nothing more than a hypothesis\r\n       which endeavours to satisfy those comparatively limited data\r\n       which we have for the present about solutions, and of those\r\n       cases of their transition into definite compounds. By submitting\r\n       solutions to the Daltonic conception of atomism, I hope that we\r\n       may not only attain to a general harmonious chemical doctrine,\r\n       but also that new motives for investigation and research will\r\n       appear in the problem of solutions, which must either confirm the\r\n       proposed theory or replace it by another fuller and truer one;\r\n       and I for my part cannot consider this to be the case with any of\r\n       the other present doctrines of solutions (note 49).\r\n\r\nWe saw above that copper sulphate loses four-fifths of its water at\r\n100° and the remainder at 240°. This means that there are two definite\r\ncompounds of water with the anhydrous salt. Washing soda or carbonate of\r\nsodium, Na_{2}CO_{3} separates out as crystals, Na_{2}CO_{3},10H_{2}O,\r\ncontaining 62·9 p.c. of water by weight, from its solutions at the\r\nordinary temperature. When a solution of the same salt deposits crystals\r\nat a low temperature, about -20°, then these crystals contain 71·8\r\nparts of water per 28·2 parts of anhydrous salt. Further, the crystals\r\nare obtained together with ice, and are left behind when it melts. If\r\nordinary soda, with 62·9 p.c. of water, be cautiously melted in its\r\nown water of crystallisation, there remains a salt, in a solid state,\r\ncontaining only 14·5 p.c. of water, and a liquid is obtained which\r\ncontains the solution of a salt which separates out crystals at 34°,\r\nwhich contain 46 p.c. of water and do not effloresce in air. Lastly,\r\nif a supersaturated solution of soda be prepared, then at temperatures\r\nbelow 8° it deposits crystals containing 54·3 p.c. of water. Thus as\r\nmany as five compounds of anhydrous soda with water are known; and\r\nthey are dissimilar in their properties and crystalline form, and even\r\nin their solubility. It is to be observed that the greatest amount of\r\nwater in the crystals corresponds with a temperature of -20°, and the\r\nsmallest to the highest temperature. There is apparently no relation\r\nbetween the above quantities of water and the salts, but this is only\r\nbecause in each case the amount of water and anhydrous salt was given\r\nin percentages; but if it be calculated for one and the same quantity\r\nof anhydrous salt, or of water, a great regularity will be observed in\r\nthe amounts of the component parts in all these compounds. It appears\r\nthat for 106 parts of anhydrous salt in the crystals separated out at\r\n-20° there are 270 parts of water; in the crystals obtained at 15° there\r\nare 180 parts of water; in the crystals obtained from a supersaturated\r\nsolution 126 parts, in the crystals which separate out at 34°, 90\r\nparts, and the crystals with the smallest amount of water, 18 parts.\r\nOn comparing these quantities of water it may easily be seen that they\r\nare in simple proportion to each other, for they are all divisible by\r\n18, and are in the ratio 15 : 10 : 7 : 5 : 1. Naturally, direct\r\nexperiment, however carefully it be conducted, is hampered with errors,\r\nbut taking these unavoidable experimental errors into consideration,\r\nit will be seen that for a given quantity of an anhydrous substance\r\nthere occur, in several of its compounds with water, quantities of\r\nwater which are in very simple multiple proportion. This is observed\r\nin, and is common to, all definite chemical compounds. This rule is\r\ncalled _the law of multiple proportions_. It was discovered by Dalton,\r\nand will be evolved in further detail subsequently in this work. For\r\nthe present we will only state that the law of definite composition\r\nenables the composition of substances to be expressed by formulæ,\r\nand the law of multiple proportions permits the application of whole\r\nnumbers as coefficients of the symbols of the elements in these formulæ.\r\nThus the formula Na_{2}CO_{3},10H_{2}O shows directly that in this\r\ncrystallo-hydrate there are 180 parts of water to 106 parts by weight of\r\nthe anhydrous salt, because the formula of soda, Na_{2}CO_{3}, directly\r\nanswers to a weight of 106, and the formula of water to 18 parts, by\r\nweight, which are here taken 10 times.\r\n\r\nIn the above examples of the combinations of water, we saw the gradually\r\nincreasing intensity of the bond between water and a substance with\r\nwhich it forms a homogeneous compound. There is a series of such\r\ncompounds with water, in which the water is held with very great force,\r\nand is only given up at a very high temperature, and sometimes cannot\r\nbe separated by any degree of heat without the entire decomposition\r\nof the substance. In these compounds there is generally no outward\r\nsign whatever of their containing water. A perfectly new substance is\r\nformed from an anhydrous substance and water, in which sometimes the\r\nproperties of neither one nor the other substance are observable. In\r\nthe majority of cases, a considerable amount of heat is evolved in the\r\nformation of such compounds with water. Sometimes the heat evolved is\r\nso intense that a red heat is produced and light is emitted. It is\r\nhardly to be wondered at, after this, that stable compounds are formed\r\nby such a combination. Their decomposition requires great heat; a large\r\namount of work is necessary to separate them into their component\r\nparts. All such compounds are definite, and, generally, completely and\r\nclearly definite. The number of such definite compounds with water or\r\n_hydrates_, in the narrow sense of the word, is generally inconsiderable\r\nfor each anhydrous substance; in the greater number of cases, there is\r\nformed only one such combination of a substance with water, one hydrate,\r\nhaving so great a stability. The water contained in these compounds is\r\noften called _water of constitution_--_i.e._ water which enters into the\r\nstructure or composition of the given substance. By this it is desired\r\nto express, that in other cases the molecules of water are, as it were,\r\nseparate from the molecules of that substance with which it is combined.\r\nIt is supposed that in the formation of hydrates this water, even in\r\nthe smallest particles, forms one complete whole with the anhydrous\r\nsubstance. Many examples of the formation of such hydrates might be\r\ncited. The most familiar example in practice is the hydrate of lime,\r\nor so-called 'slaked' lime. Lime is prepared by burning limestone, by\r\nwhich the carbonic anhydride is expelled from it, and there remains\r\na white stony mass, which is dense, compact, and rather tenacious.\r\nLime is usually sold in this form, and bears the name of 'quick' or\r\n'unslaked' lime. If water be poured over such lime, a great rise in\r\ntemperature is remarked either directly, or after a certain time. The\r\nwhole mass becomes hot, part of the water is evaporated, the stony mass\r\nin absorbing water crumbles into powder, and if the water be taken in\r\nsufficient quantity and the lime be pure and well burnt, not a particle\r\nof the original stony mass is left--it all crumbles into powder. If\r\nthe water be in excess, then naturally a portion of it remains and\r\nforms a solution. This process is called 'slaking' lime. Slaked lime is\r\nused in practice in intermixture with sand as mortar. Slaked lime is a\r\ndefinite hydrate of lime. If it is dried at 100° it retains 24·3 p.c.\r\nof water. This water can only be expelled at a temperature above 400°,\r\nand then quicklime is re-obtained. The heat evolved in the combination\r\nof lime with water is so intense that it can set fire to wood, sulphur,\r\ngunpowder, &c. Even on mixing lime with ice the temperature rises to\r\n100°. If lime be moistened with a small quantity of water in the dark,\r\na luminous effect is observed. But, nevertheless, water may still be\r\nseparated from this hydrate.[71] If phosphorus be burnt in dry air, a\r\nwhite substance called 'phosphoric anhydride' is obtained. It combines\r\nwith water with such energy, that the experiment must be conducted with\r\ngreat caution. A red heat is produced in the formation of the compound,\r\nand it is impossible to separate the water from the resultant hydrate\r\nat any temperature. The hydrate formed by phosphoric anhydride is a\r\nsubstance which is totally undecomposable into its original component\r\nparts by the action of heat. Almost as energetic a combination occurs\r\nwhen sulphuric anhydride, SO_{3}, combines with water, forming its\r\nhydrate, sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}. In both cases definite compounds\r\nare produced, but the latter substance, as a liquid, and capable of\r\ndecomposition by heat, forms an evident link with solutions. If 80 parts\r\nof sulphuric anhydride retain 18 parts of water, this water cannot be\r\nseparated from the anhydride, even at a temperature of 300°. It is only\r\nby the addition of phosphoric anhydride, or by a series of chemical\r\ntransformations, that this water can be separated from its compound\r\nwith sulphuric anhydride. Oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid, is such a\r\ncompound. If a larger proportion of water be taken, it will combine\r\nwith the H_{2}SO_{4}; for instance, if 36 parts of water per 80 parts of\r\nsulphuric anhydride be taken, a compound is formed which crystallises in\r\nthe cold, and melts at +8°, whilst oil of vitriol does not solidify even\r\nat -30°. If still more water be taken, the oil of vitriol will dissolve\r\nin the remaining quantity of water. An evolution of heat takes place,\r\nnot only on the addition of the water of constitution, but in a less\r\ndegree on further additions of water.[72] And therefore there is no\r\ndistinct boundary, but only a gradual transition, between those chemical\r\nphenomena which are expressed in the formation of solutions and those\r\nwhich take place in the formation of the most stable hydrates.[73]\r\n\r\n  [71] In combining with water one part by weight of lime evolves 245\r\n       units of heat. A high temperature is obtained, because the\r\n       specific heat of the resulting product is small. Sodium oxide,\r\n       Na_{2}O, in reacting on water, H_{2}O, and forming caustic soda\r\n       (sodium hydroxide), NaHO, evolves 552 units of heat for each part\r\n       by weight of sodium oxide.\r\n\r\n  [72] The diagram given in note 28 shows the evolution of heat on the\r\n       mixture of sulphuric acid, or monohydrate (H_{2}SO_{4}, _i.e._\r\n       SO_{3} + H_{2}O), with different quantities of water per 100\r\n       vols. of the resultant solution. Every 98 grams of sulphuric\r\n       acid (H_{2}SO_{4}) evolve, on the addition of 18 grams of water,\r\n       6,379 units of heat; with twice or three times the quantity of\r\n       water 9,418 and 11,137 units of heat, and with an infinitely\r\n       large quantity of water 17,860 units of heat, according to the\r\n       determinations of Thomsen. He also showed that when H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n       is formed from SO_{3} (= 80) and H_{2}O (= 18), 21,308 units\r\n       of heat are evolved per 98 parts by weight of the resultant\r\n       sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n  [73] Thus, for different hydrates the stability with which they hold\r\n       water is very dissimilar. Certain hydrates hold water very\r\n       loosely, and in combining with it evolve little heat. From\r\n       other hydrates the water cannot be separated by any degree of\r\n       heat, even if they are formed from anhydrides (_i.e._ anhydrous\r\n       substances) and water with little evolution of heat; for\r\n       instance, acetic anhydride in combining with water evolves an\r\n       inconsiderable amount of heat, but the water cannot then be\r\n       expelled from it. If the hydrate (acetic acid) formed by this\r\n       combination be strongly heated it either volatilises without\r\n       change, or decomposes into new substances, but it does not again\r\n       yield the original substances--_i.e._, the anhydride and water,\r\n       at least in a liquid form. Here is an instance which gives the\r\n       reason for calling the water entering into the composition of the\r\n       hydrate, water of constitution. Such, for example, is the water\r\n       entering into the so-called caustic soda or sodium hydroxide\r\n       (_see_ note 71). But there are hydrates which easily part with\r\n       their water; yet this water cannot be considered as water of\r\n       crystallisation, not only because sometimes such hydrates have no\r\n       crystalline form, but also because, in perfectly analogous cases,\r\n       very stable hydrates are formed, which are capable of particular\r\n       kinds of chemical reactions, as we shall subsequently learn.\r\n       Such, for example, is the unstable hydrated oxide of copper,\r\n       which is not formed from water and oxide of copper, but which is\r\n       obtained just like far more stable hydrates, for example, the\r\n       hydrated oxide of barium BaH_{2}O_{2} equal to BaO + H_{2}O, by\r\n       the double decomposition of the solution of salts with alkalies.\r\n       In a word, there is no distinct boundary either between the water\r\n       of hydrates and of crystallisation, or between solution and\r\n       hydration.\r\n\r\n       It must be observed that in separating from an aqueous solution,\r\n       many substances, without having a crystalline form, hold water in\r\n       the same unstable state as in crystals; only this water cannot\r\n       be termed 'water of crystallisation' if the substance which\r\n       separates out has no crystalline form. The hydrates of alumina\r\n       and silica are examples of such unstable hydrates. If these\r\n       substances are separated from an aqueous solution by a chemical\r\n       process, then they always contain water. The formation of a new\r\n       chemical compound containing water is here particularly evident,\r\n       for alumina and silica in an anhydrous state have chemical\r\n       properties differing from those they show when combined with\r\n       water, and do not combine directly with it. The entire series of\r\n       colloids on separating from water form similar compounds with\r\n       it, which have the aspect of solid gelatinous substances. Water\r\n       is held in a considerable quantity in solidified glue or boiled\r\n       albumin. It cannot be expelled from them by pressure; hence,\r\n       in this case there has ensued some kind of combination of the\r\n       substance with water. This water, however, is easily separated on\r\n       drying; but not the whole of it, a portion being retained, and\r\n       this portion is considered to belong to the hydrate, although\r\n       in this case it is very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain\r\n       definite compounds. The absence of any distinct boundary lines\r\n       between solutions, crystallo-hydrates, and ordinary hydrates\r\n       above referred to, is very clearly seen in such examples.\r\n\r\nWe have thus considered many aspects and degrees of combination of\r\nvarious substances with water, or instances of the compounds of water,\r\nwhen it and other substances form new homogeneous substances, which\r\nin this case will evidently be complex--_i.e._ made up of different\r\nsubstances--and although they are homogeneous, yet it must be admitted\r\nthat in them there exist those component parts which entered into their\r\ncomposition, inasmuch as these parts may be re-obtained from them. It\r\nmust not be imagined that water really exists in hydrate of lime, any\r\nmore than that ice or steam exists in water. When we say that water\r\noccurs in the composition of a certain hydrate, we only wish to point\r\nout that there are chemical transformations in which it is possible to\r\nobtain that hydrate by means of water, and other transformations in\r\nwhich this water may be separated out from the hydrate. This is all\r\nsimply expressed by the words, that water enters into the composition of\r\nthis hydrate. If a hydrate be formed by feeble bonds, and be decomposed\r\neven at the ordinary temperature, and be a liquid, then the water\r\nappears as one of the products of dissociation, and this gives an idea\r\nof what solutions are, and forms the fundamental distinction between\r\nthem and other hydrates in which the water is combined with greater\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                   THE COMPOSITION OF WATER, HYDROGEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, Is not _water_ itself a _compound substance_?\r\nCannot it be formed by the mutual combination of some component parts?\r\nCannot it be broken up into its component parts? There cannot be the\r\nleast doubt that if it does split up, and if it is a compound, then it\r\nis a _definite_ one characterised by the stability of the union between\r\nthose component parts from which it is formed. From the fact alone that\r\nwater passes into all physical states as a homogeneous whole, without\r\nin the least varying chemically in its properties and without splitting\r\nup into its component parts (neither solutions nor many hydrates can\r\nbe distilled--they are split up), we must conclude, from this fact\r\nalone, that if water is a compound then it is a stable and definite\r\nchemical compound capable of entering into many other combinations.\r\nLike many other great discoveries in the province of chemistry, it is\r\nto the end of the last century that we are indebted for the important\r\ndiscovery that water is not a simple substance, that it is composed of\r\ntwo substances like a number of other compound substances. This was\r\nproved by two of the methods by which the compound nature of bodies\r\nmay be directly determined; by analysis and by synthesis--that is,\r\nby a method of the decomposition of water into, and of the formation\r\nof water from, its component parts. In 1781 Cavendish first obtained\r\nwater by burning hydrogen in oxygen, both of which gases were already\r\nknown to him. He concluded from this that water was composed of two\r\nsubstances. But he did not make more accurate experiments, which would\r\nhave shown the relative quantities of the component parts in water,\r\nand which would have determined its complex nature with certainty.\r\nAlthough his experiments were the first, and although the conclusion\r\nhe drew from them was true, yet such novel ideas as the complex nature\r\nof water are not easily recognised so long as there is no series of\r\nresearches which entirely and indubitably proves the truth of such a\r\nconclusion. The fundamental experiments which proved the complexity\r\nof water by the method of synthesis, and of its formation from other\r\nsubstances, were made in 1789 by Monge, Lavoisier, Fourcroy, and\r\nVauquelin. They obtained four ounces of water by burning hydrogen,\r\nand found that water consists of 15 parts of hydrogen and 85 parts of\r\noxygen. It was also proved that the weight of water formed was equal\r\nto the sum of the weights of the component parts entering into its\r\ncomposition; consequently, water contains all the matter entering into\r\noxygen and hydrogen. The complexity of water was proved in this manner\r\nby a method of synthesis. But we will turn to its analysis--_i.e._ to\r\nits decomposition into its component parts. The analysis may be more or\r\nless complete. Either both component parts may be obtained in a separate\r\nstate, or else only one is separated and the other is converted into a\r\nnew compound in which its amount may be determined by weighing. This\r\nwill be a reaction of substitution, such as is often taken advantage of\r\nfor analysis. The first analysis of water was thus conducted in 1784\r\nby Lavoisier and Meusnier. The apparatus they arranged consisted of a\r\nglass retort containing water previously purified, and of which the\r\nweight had been determined. The neck of the retort was inserted into\r\na porcelain tube, placed inside an oven, and heated to a red heat by\r\ncharcoal. Iron filings, which decompose water at a red heat, were placed\r\ninside this tube. The end of the tube was connected with a worm, for\r\ncondensing any water which might pass through the tube undecomposed.\r\nThis condensed water was collected in a separate flask. The gas formed\r\nby the decomposition was collected over water in a bell jar. The aqueous\r\nvapour in passing over the red-hot iron was decomposed, and a gas was\r\nformed from it whose weight could be determined from its volume, its\r\ndensity being known. Besides the water which passed through the tube\r\nunaltered, a certain quantity of water disappeared in the experiment,\r\nand this quantity, in the experiments of Lavoisier and Meusnier, was\r\nequal to the weight of gas which was collected in the bell jar plus the\r\nincrease in weight of the iron filings. Hence the water was decomposed\r\ninto a gas, which was collected in the bell jar, and a substance, which\r\ncombined with the iron; consequently, it is composed of these two\r\ncomponent parts. This was the first analysis of water ever made; but\r\nhere only one (and not both) of the gaseous component parts of water was\r\ncollected separately. Both the component parts of water can, however,\r\nbe simultaneously obtained in a free state. For this purpose the\r\ndecomposition is brought about by a galvanic current or by heat, as we\r\nshall learn directly.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] The first experiments of the synthesis and decomposition of water\r\n      did not afford, however, an entirely convincing proof that water\r\n      was composed of hydrogen and oxygen only. Davy, who investigated\r\n      the decomposition of water by the galvanic current, thought for a\r\n      long time that, besides the gases, an acid and alkali were also\r\n      obtained. He was only convinced of the fact that water contains\r\n      nothing but hydrogen and oxygen by a long series of researches,\r\n      which showed him that the appearance of an acid and alkali in the\r\n      decomposition of water proceeds from the presence of impurities\r\n      (especially from the presence of ammonium nitrate) in water. A\r\n      final comprehension of the composition of water is obtained from\r\n      the accurate determination of the quantities of the component\r\n      parts which enter into its composition. It will be seen from\r\n      this how many data are necessary for proving the composition of\r\n      water--that is, of the transformations of which it is capable.\r\n      What has been said of water refers to all other compounds; the\r\n      investigation of each one, the entire proof of its composition,\r\n      can only be obtained by the accumulation of a large mass of data\r\n      referring to it.\r\n\r\nWater is a bad conductor of electricity--that is, pure water does not\r\ntransmit a feeble current; but if any salt or acid be dissolved in it,\r\nthen its conductivity increases, and _on the passage of a current_\r\nthrough acidified water _it is decomposed_ into its component parts.\r\nSome sulphuric acid is generally added to the water. By immersing\r\nplatinum plates (electrodes) in this water (platinum is chosen because\r\nit is not acted on by acids, whilst many other metals are chemically\r\nacted on by acids), and connecting them with a galvanic battery, it\r\nwill be observed that bubbles of gas appear on these plates. The gas\r\nwhich separates is called _detonating gas_,[2] because, on ignition,\r\nit very easily explodes.[3] What takes place is as follows:--First,\r\nthe water, by the action of the current, is decomposed into two gases.\r\nThe mixture of these gases forms detonating gas. When detonating gas\r\nis brought into contact with an incandescent substance--for instance,\r\na lighted taper--the gases re-combine, forming water, the combination\r\nbeing accompanied by a great evolution of heat, and therefore the vapour\r\nof the water formed expands considerably, which it does very rapidly,\r\nand as a consequence, an explosion takes place--that is, sound and\r\nincrease of pressure, and atmospheric disturbance, as in the explosion\r\nof gunpowder.\r\n\r\n  [2] This gas is collected in a voltameter.\r\n\r\n  [3] In order to observe this explosion without the slightest danger,\r\n      it is best to proceed in the following manner. Some soapy water is\r\n      prepared, so that it easily forms soap bubbles, and it is poured\r\n      into an iron trough. In this water, the end of a gas-conducting\r\n      tube is immersed. This tube is connected with any suitable\r\n      apparatus, in which detonating gas is evolved. Soap bubbles,\r\n      full of this gas, are then formed. If the apparatus in which the\r\n      gas is produced be then removed (otherwise the explosion might\r\n      travel into the interior of the apparatus), and a lighted taper be\r\n      brought to the soap bubbles, a very sharp explosion takes place.\r\n      The bubbles should be small to avoid any danger; ten, each about\r\n      the size of a pea, suffice to give a sharp report, like a pistol\r\n      shot.\r\n\r\nIn order to discover what gases are obtained by the decomposition of\r\nwater, the gases which separate at each electrode must be collected\r\nseparately. For this purpose a V-shaped tube is taken; one of its ends\r\nis open and the other fused up. A platinum wire, terminating inside\r\nthe tube in a plate, is fused into the closed end; the closed end is\r\nentirely filled with water[4] acidified with sulphuric acid, and another\r\nplatinum wire, terminating in a plate, is immersed in the open end. If\r\na current from a galvanic battery be now passed through the wires an\r\nevolution of gases will be observed, and the gas which is obtained in\r\nthe open branch passes into the air, while that in the closed branch\r\naccumulates above the water. As this gas accumulates it displaces the\r\nwater, which continues to descend in the closed and ascend into the open\r\nbranch of the tubes. When the water, in this way, reaches the top of the\r\nopen end, the passage of the current is stopped, and the gas which was\r\nevolved from one of the electrodes only is obtained in the apparatus.\r\nBy this means it is easy to prove that a particular gas appears at each\r\nelectrode. If the closed end be connected with the negative pole--_i.e._\r\nwith that joined to the zinc--then the gas collected in the apparatus\r\nis capable of burning. This may be demonstrated by the following\r\nexperiment:--The bent tube is taken off the stand, and its open end\r\nstopped up with the thumb and inclined in such a manner that the gas\r\npasses from the closed to the open end. It will then be found, on\r\napplying a lighted lamp or taper, that the gas burns. This combustible\r\ngas is _hydrogen_. If the same experiment be carried on with a current\r\npassing in the opposite direction--that is, if the closed end be joined\r\nup with the positive pole (_i.e._ with the carbon, copper, or platinum),\r\nthen the gas which is evolved from it does not itself burn, but it\r\nsupports combustion very vigorously, so that a smouldering taper in it\r\nimmediately bursts into flame. This gas, which is collected at the anode\r\nor positive pole, is _oxygen_, which is obtained, as we saw before (in\r\nthe Introduction), from mercury oxide and is contained in air.\r\n\r\n  [4] In order to fill the tube with water, it is turned up, so that\r\n      the closed end points downwards and the open end upwards, and\r\n      water acidified with sulphuric acid is poured into it.\r\n\r\nThus in the decomposition of water oxygen appears at the positive pole\r\nand hydrogen at the negative pole,[4 bis] so that detonating gas will be\r\na mixture of both. Hydrogen burns in air from the fact that in doing so\r\nit re-forms water, with the oxygen of the air. Detonating gas explodes\r\nfrom the fact that the hydrogen burns in the oxygen mixed with it. It\r\nis very easy to measure the relative quantities of one and the other\r\ngas which are evolved in the decomposition of water. For this purpose\r\na funnel is taken, whose orifice is closed by a cork through which two\r\nplatinum wires pass. These wires are connected with a battery. Acidified\r\nwater is poured into the funnel, and a glass cylinder full of water\r\nis placed over the end of each wire (fig. 18). On passing a current,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen collect in these cylinders, and it will easily be\r\nseen that two volumes of hydrogen are evolved for every one volume of\r\noxygen. This signifies that, in decomposing, water gives two volumes of\r\nhydrogen and one volume of oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [4 bis] Owing to the gradual but steady progress made during the\r\n      last twenty-five years in the production of an electric current\r\n      from the dynamo and its transmission over considerable distances,\r\n      the electrolytic decomposition of many compound bodies has\r\n      acquired great importance, and the use of the electric current is\r\n      making its way into many chemical manufactures. Hence, Prof. D.\r\n      A. Lachinoff's proposal to obtain hydrogen and oxygen (both of\r\n      which have many applications) by means of electrolysis (either of\r\n      a 10 to 15 per cent. solution of caustic soda or a 15 per cent.\r\n      solution of sulphuric acid) may find a practical application, at\r\n      all events in the future. In general, owing to their simplicity,\r\n      electrolytic methods have a great future, but as yet, so long\r\n      as the production of an electric current remains so costly,\r\n      their application is limited. And for this reason, although\r\n      certain of these methods are mentioned in this work, they are\r\n      not specially considered, the more so since a profitable and\r\n      proper use of the electric current for chemical purposes requires\r\n      special electro-technical knowledge which beginners cannot he\r\n      assumed to have, and therefore, an exposition of the principles\r\n      of electrotechnology as applied, to the production of chemical\r\n      transformations, although referred to in places, does not come\r\n      within the scope of the present work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Decomposition of water by the galvanic current,\r\nfor determining the relation between the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen.]\r\n\r\nWater is also decomposed into its component parts by _the action of\r\nheat_. At the melting point of silver (960°), and in its presence,\r\nwater is decomposed and the oxygen absorbed by the molten silver,\r\nwhich dissolves it so long as it is liquid. But directly the silver\r\nsolidifies the oxygen is expelled from it. However, this experiment\r\nis not entirely convincing; it might be thought that in this case the\r\ndecomposition of the water did not proceed from the action of heat, but\r\nfrom the action of the silver on water--that silver decomposes water,\r\ntaking up the oxygen. If steam be passed through a red-hot tube, whose\r\ninternal temperature attains 1,000°, then a portion[5] of the water\r\ndecomposes into its component parts, forming detonating gas. But on\r\npassing into the cooler portions of the apparatus this detonating gas\r\nagain reunites and forms water. The hydrogen and oxygen obtained combine\r\ntogether at a lower temperature.[6] Apparently the problem--to show the\r\ndecomposability of water at high temperatures--is unattainable. It was\r\nconsidered as such before Henri Sainte-Claire Deville (in the fifties)\r\nintroduced the conception of dissociation into chemistry, as of a change\r\nof chemical state resembling evaporation, if decomposition be likened to\r\nboiling, and before he had demonstrated the decomposability of water by\r\nthe action of heat in an experiment which will presently be described.\r\nIn order to demonstrate clearly the _dissociation_ of water, or its\r\ndecomposability by heat, at a temperature approaching that at which it\r\nis formed, it was necessary to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen at\r\na high temperature, without allowing the mixture to cool. Deville took\r\nadvantage of the difference between the densities of hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [5] As water is formed by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen, with\r\n      a considerable evolution of heat, and as it can also be\r\n      decomposed, this reaction is a reversible one (_see_\r\n      Introduction), and consequently at a high temperature the\r\n      decomposition of water cannot be complete--it is limited by the\r\n      opposite reaction. Strictly speaking, it is not known how much\r\n      water is decomposed at a given temperature, although many efforts\r\n      (Bunsen, and others) have been made in various directions to solve\r\n      this question. Not knowing the coefficient of expansion, and the\r\n      specific heat of gases at such high temperatures, renders all\r\n      calculations (from observations of the pressure on explosion)\r\n      doubtful.\r\n\r\n  [6] Grove, in 1847, observed that a platinum wire fused in the\r\n      oxyhydrogen flame--that is, having acquired the temperature\r\n      of the formation of water--and having formed a molten drop at\r\n      its end which fell into water, evolved detonating gas--that\r\n      is, decomposed water. It therefore follows that water already\r\n      decomposes at the temperature of its formation. At that time, this\r\n      formed a scientific paradox; this we shall unravel only with the\r\n      development of the conceptions of dissociation, introduced into\r\n      science by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, in 1857. These conceptions\r\n      form an important epoch in science, and their development is one\r\n      of the problems of modern chemistry. The essence of the matter is\r\n      that, at high temperatures, water exists but also decomposes, just\r\n      as a volatile liquid, at a certain temperature, exists both as a\r\n      liquid and as a vapour. Similarly as a volatile liquid saturates\r\n      a space, attaining its maximum tension, so also the products of\r\n      dissociation have their maximum tension, and once that is attained\r\n      decomposition ceases, just as evaporation ceases. Under like\r\n      conditions, if the vapour be allowed to escape (and therefore its\r\n      partial pressure be diminished), evaporation recommences, so also\r\n      if the products of decomposition be removed, decomposition again\r\n      continues. These simple conceptions of dissociation introduce\r\n      infinitely varied consequences into the mechanism of chemical\r\n      reactions, and therefore we shall have occasion to return to\r\n      them very often. We may add that Grove also concluded that water\r\n      was decomposed at a white heat, from the fact that he obtained\r\n      detonating gas by passing steam through a tube with a wire heated\r\n      strongly by an electric current, and also by passing steam over\r\n      molten oxide of lead, he obtained, on the one hand, litharge (=\r\n      oxide of lead and oxygen), and on the other, metallic lead formed\r\n      by the action of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Decomposition of water by the action of heat,\r\nand the separation of the hydrogen formed by its permeating through a\r\nporous tube.]\r\n\r\nA wide porcelain tube P (fig. 19) is placed in a furnace, which can be\r\nraised to a high temperature (it should be heated with small pieces of\r\ngood coke). In this tube there is inserted a second tube T, of smaller\r\ndiameter, made of unglazed earthenware and therefore porous. The ends\r\nof the tube are luted to the wide tube, and two tubes, C and C', are\r\ninserted into the ends, as shown in the drawing. With this arrangement\r\nit is possible for a gas to pass into the annular space between the\r\nwalls of the two tubes, from whence it can be collected. Steam from a\r\nretort or flask is passed through the tube D, into the inner porous\r\ntube T. This steam on entering the red-hot space is decomposed into\r\nhydrogen and oxygen. The densities of these gases are very different,\r\nhydrogen being sixteen times lighter than oxygen. Light gases, as we\r\nsaw above, penetrate through porous surfaces very much more rapidly\r\nthan denser gases, and therefore the hydrogen passes through the\r\npores of the tube into the annular space very much more rapidly than\r\nthe oxygen. The hydrogen which separates out into the annular space\r\ncan only be collected when this space does not contain any oxygen.\r\nIf any air remains in this space, then the hydrogen which separates\r\nout will combine with its oxygen and form water. For this reason a\r\ngas incapable of supporting combustion--for instance, nitrogen or\r\ncarbonic anhydride--is previously passed into the annular space. Thus\r\nthe carbonic anhydride is passed through the tube C, and the hydrogen,\r\nseparated from the steam, is collected through the tube C', and will be\r\npartly mixed with carbonic anhydride. A certain portion of the carbonic\r\nanhydride will penetrate through the pores of the unglazed tube into\r\nthe interior of the tube T. The oxygen will remain in this tube, and\r\nthe volume of the remaining oxygen will be half that of the volume of\r\nhydrogen which separates out from the annular space.[6 bis]\r\n\r\n  [6 bis] Part of the oxygen will also penetrate through the pores\r\n      of the tube; but, as was said before, a much smaller quantity\r\n      than the hydrogen, and as the density of oxygen is sixteen times\r\n      greater than that of hydrogen, the volume of oxygen which passes\r\n      through the porous walls will be four times less than the volume\r\n      of hydrogen (the quantities of gases passing through porous\r\n      walls are inversely proportional to the square roots of their\r\n      densities). The oxygen which separates out into the annular\r\n      space will combine, at a certain fall of temperature, with the\r\n      hydrogen; but as each volume of oxygen only requires two volumes\r\n      of hydrogen, whilst at least four volumes of hydrogen will pass\r\n      through the porous walls for every volume of oxygen that passes,\r\n      therefore, part of the hydrogen will remain free, and can be\r\n      collected from the annular space. A corresponding quantity of\r\n      oxygen remaining from the decomposition of the water can be\r\n      collected from the internal tube.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of water is effected much more easily by a method of\r\nsubstitution, taking advantage of the affinity of substances for the\r\noxygen or the hydrogen of water. If a substance be added to water,\r\nwhich takes up the oxygen and replaces the hydrogen--then we shall\r\nobtain the latter gas from the water. Thus with sodium, water gives\r\nhydrogen, and with chlorine, which takes up the hydrogen, oxygen is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is evolved from water by many metals, which are capable\r\nof forming oxides in air--that is, which are capable of burning or\r\ncombining with oxygen. The capacity of metals for combining with\r\noxygen, and therefore for decomposing water, or for the evolution of\r\nhydrogen, is very dissimilar.[7] Among metals, potassium and sodium\r\nexhibit considerable energy in this respect. The first occurs in\r\npotash, the second in soda. They are both lighter than water, soft, and\r\neasily change in air. By bringing one or the other of them in contact\r\nwith water at the ordinary temperature,[8] a quantity of hydrogen,\r\ncorresponding with the amount of the metal taken, may be directly\r\nobtained. One gram of hydrogen, occupying a volume of 11·16 litres at 0°\r\nand 760 mm., is evolved from every 39 grams of potassium, or 23 grams of\r\nsodium. The phenomenon may be observed in the following way: a solution\r\nof sodium in mercury--or 'sodium amalgam,' as it is generally called--is\r\npoured into a vessel containing water, and owing to its weight sinks to\r\nthe bottom; the sodium held in the mercury then acts on the water like\r\npure sodium, liberating hydrogen. The mercury does not act here, and the\r\nsame amount of it as was taken for dissolving the sodium is obtained in\r\nthe residue. The hydrogen is evolved gradually in the form of bubbles,\r\nwhich pass through the liquid.\r\n\r\n  [7] In order to demonstrate the difference of the affinity of oxygen\r\n      for different elements, it is enough to compare the amounts of\r\n      heats which are evolved in their combination with 16 parts by\r\n      weight of oxygen; in the case of sodium (when Na_{2}O is formed,\r\n      or 46 parts of Na combine with 16 parts of oxygen, according to\r\n      Beketoff) 100,000 calories (or units of heat), are evolved, for\r\n      hydrogen (when water, H_{2}O, is formed) 69,000 calories, for\r\n      iron (when the oxide FeO is formed) 69,000, and if the oxide\r\n      Fe_{2}O_{3} is formed, 64,000 calories, for zinc (ZnO is formed)\r\n      86,000 calories, for lead (when PbO is formed) 51,000 calories,\r\n      for copper (when CuO is formed) 38,000 calories, and for mercury\r\n      (HgO is formed) 31,000 calories.\r\n\r\n      These figures cannot correspond directly with the magnitude of the\r\n      affinities, for the physical and mechanical side of the matter is\r\n      very different in the different cases. Hydrogen is a gas, and, in\r\n      combining with oxygen, gives a liquid; consequently it changes\r\n      its physical state, and, in doing so, evolves heat. But zinc and\r\n      copper are solids, and, in combining with oxygen, give solid\r\n      oxides. The oxygen, previously a gas, now passes into a solid or\r\n      liquid state, and, therefore, also must have given up its store of\r\n      heat in forming oxides. As we shall afterwards see, the degree of\r\n      contraction (and consequently of mechanical work) was different\r\n      in the different cases, and therefore the figures expressing the\r\n      heat of combination cannot directly depend on the affinities,\r\n      on the loss of internal energy previously in the elements.\r\n      Nevertheless, the figures above cited correspond, in a certain\r\n      degree, with the order in which the elements stand in respect\r\n      to their affinity for oxygen, as may be seen from the fact that\r\n      the mercury oxide, which evolves the least heat (among the above\r\n      examples), is the least stable is easily decomposed, giving up its\r\n      oxygen; whilst sodium, the formation of whose oxide is accompanied\r\n      by the greatest evolution of heat, is able to decompose all the\r\n      other oxides, taking up their oxygen. In order to generalise the\r\n      connection between affinity and the evolution and the absorption\r\n      of heat, which is evident in its general features, and was firmly\r\n      established by the researches of Favre and Silbermann (about\r\n      1840), and then of Thomsen (in Denmark) and Berthelot (in France),\r\n      many investigators, especially the one last mentioned, established\r\n      the _law of maximum work_. This states that only those chemical\r\n      reactions take place of their own accord in which the greatest\r\n      amount of chemical (latent, potential) energy is transformed into\r\n      heat. But, in the first place, we are not able, judging from what\r\n      has been said above, to distinguish that heat which corresponds\r\n      with purely chemical action from the sum total of the heat\r\n      observed in a reaction (in the calorimeter); in the second place,\r\n      there are evidently endothermal reactions which proceed under\r\n      the same circumstances as exothermal (carbon burns in the vapour\r\n      of sulphur with absorption of heat, whilst in oxygen it evolves\r\n      heat); and, in the third place, there are reversible reactions,\r\n      which when taking place in one direction evolve heat, and when\r\n      taking place in the opposite direction absorb it; and, therefore,\r\n      the principle of maximum work in its elementary form is not\r\n      supported by science. But the subject continues to be developed,\r\n      and will probably lead to a general law, such as thermal chemistry\r\n      does not at present possess.\r\n\r\n  [8] If a piece of metallic sodium be thrown into water, it floats on it\r\n      (owing to its lightness), keeps in a state of continual motion\r\n      (owing to the evolution of hydrogen on all sides), and immediately\r\n      decomposes the water, evolving hydrogen, which can be lighted.\r\n      This experiment may, however, lead to an explosion should the\r\n      sodium stick to the walls of the vessel, and begin to act on the\r\n      limited mass of water immediately adjacent to it (probably in\r\n      this case NaHO forms with Na, Na_{2}O, which acts on the water,\r\n      evolving much heat and rapidly forming steam), and the experiment\r\n      should therefore be carried on with caution. The decomposition\r\n      of water by sodium may he better demonstrated, and with greater\r\n      safety, in the following manner. Into a glass cylinder filled\r\n      with mercury, and immersed in a mercury bath, water is first\r\n      introduced, which will, owing to its lightness, rise to the top,\r\n      and then a piece of sodium wrapped in paper is introduced with\r\n      forceps into the cylinder. The metal rises through the mercury\r\n      to the surface of the water, on which it remains, and evolves\r\n      hydrogen, which collects in the cylinder, and may be tested after\r\n      the experiment has been completed. The safest method of making\r\n      this experiment is, however, as follows. The sodium (cleaned from\r\n      the naphtha in which it is kept) is either wrapped in fine copper\r\n      gauze and held by forceps, or else held in forceps at the end of\r\n      which a small copper cage is attached, and is then held under\r\n      water. The evolution of hydrogen goes on quietly, and it may he\r\n      collected in a bell jar and then lighted.\r\n\r\nBeyond the hydrogen evolved and a solid substance, which remains in\r\nsolution (it may be obtained by evaporating the resultant solution) no\r\nother products are here obtained. Consequently, from the two substances\r\n(water and sodium) taken, the same number of new substances (hydrogen\r\nand the substance dissolved in water) have been obtained, from which we\r\nmay conclude that the reaction which here takes place is a reaction of\r\ndouble decomposition or of substitution. The resultant solid is nothing\r\nelse but the so-called caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), which is made\r\nup of sodium, oxygen, and half of the hydrogen contained in the water.\r\nTherefore, the substitution took place between the hydrogen and the\r\nsodium, namely half of the hydrogen in the water was replaced by the\r\nsodium, and was evolved in a free state. Hence the reaction which takes\r\nplace here may be expressed by the equation H_{2}O + Na = NaHO + H; the\r\nmeaning of this is clear from what has already been said.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] This reaction is vigorously exothermal, _i.e._ it is accompanied\r\n      by the evolution of heat. If a sufficient quantity of water\r\n      be taken the whole of the sodium hydroxide, NaHO, formed is\r\n      dissolved, and about 42,500 units of heat are evolved per 23 grams\r\n      of sodium taken. As 40 grams of sodium hydroxide are produced,\r\n      and they in dissolving, judging from direct experiment, evolve\r\n      about 10,000 calories; therefore, without an excess of water, and\r\n      without the formation of a solution, the reaction would evolve\r\n      about 32,500 calories. We shall afterwards learn that hydrogen\r\n      contains in its smallest isolable particles H_{2} and not H,\r\n      and therefore it follows that the reaction should be written\r\n      thus--2Na + 2H_{2}O = H_{2} + 2NaOH, and it then corresponds with\r\n      an evolution of heat of +65,000 calories. And as N. N. Beketoff\r\n      showed that Na_{2}O, or anhydrous oxide of sodium, forms the\r\n      hydrate, or sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), 2NaHO, with water,\r\n      evolving about 35,500 calories, therefore the reaction 2Na +\r\n      H_{2}O = H_{2} + Na_{2}O corresponds to 29,500 calories. This\r\n      quantity of heat is less than that which is evolved in combining\r\n      with water, in the formation of caustic soda, and therefore it is\r\n      not to be wondered at that the hydrate, NaHO, is always formed\r\n      and not the anhydrous substance Na_{2}O. That such a conclusion,\r\n      which agrees with facts, is inevitable is also seen from the fact\r\n      that, according to Beketoff, the anhydrous sodium oxide, Na_{2}O,\r\n      acts directly on hydrogen, with separation of sodium, Na_{2}O + H\r\n      = NaHO + Na. This reaction is accompanied by an evolution of heat\r\n      equal to about 3,000 calories, because Na_{2}O + H_{2}O gives, as\r\n      we saw, 35,500 calories and Na + H_{2}O evolves 32,500 calories.\r\n      However, an opposite reaction also takes place--NaHO + Na =\r\n      Na_{2}O + H (both with the aid of heat)--consequently, in this\r\n      case heat is absorbed. In this we see an example of calorimetric\r\n      calculations and the limited application of the law of maximum\r\n      work for the general phenomena of reversible reactions, to which\r\n      the case just considered belongs. But it must be remarked that\r\n      all reversible reactions evolve or absorb but little heat, and\r\n      the reason of the law of maximum work, not being universal must\r\n      first of all be looked for in the fact that we have no means of\r\n      separating the heat which corresponds with the purely chemical\r\n      process from the sum total of the heat observed, and as the\r\n      structure of a number of substances is altered by heat and also\r\n      by contact, we can scarcely hope that the time approaches when\r\n      such a distinction will be possible. A heated substance, in point\r\n      of fact, has no longer the original energy of its atoms--that is,\r\n      the act of heating not only alters the store of motion of the\r\n      molecules but also of the atoms forming the molecules, in other\r\n      words, it makes the beginning of or preparation for chemical\r\n      change. From this it must be concluded that thermochemistry, or\r\n      the study of the heat accompanying chemical transformations,\r\n      cannot he identified with chemical mechanics. Thermo-chemical data\r\n      form a part of it, but they alone cannot give it.\r\n\r\nSodium and potassium act on water at the ordinary temperature. Other\r\nheavier metals only act on it with a rise of temperature, and then not\r\nso rapidly or vigorously. Thus magnesium and calcium only liberate\r\nhydrogen from water at its boiling point, and zinc and iron only a red\r\nheat, whilst a whole series of heavy metals, such as copper, lead,\r\nmercury, silver, gold, and platinum, do not in the least decompose water\r\nat any temperature, and do not replace its hydrogen.\r\n\r\nFrom this it is clear that hydrogen may be obtained by the decomposition\r\nof steam by the action of iron (or zinc) with a rise of temperature.\r\nThe experiment is conducted in the following manner: pieces of iron\r\n(filings, nails, &c.), are placed in a porcelain tube, which is then\r\nsubjected to a strong heat and steam passed through it. The steam,\r\ncoming into contact with the iron, gives up its oxygen to it, and thus\r\nthe hydrogen is set free and passes out at the other end of the tube\r\ntogether with undecomposed steam. This method, which is historically\r\nvery significant,[10] is practically inconvenient, as it requires a\r\nrather high temperature. Further, this reaction, as a reversible one\r\n(a red-hot mass of iron decomposes a current of steam, forming oxide\r\nand hydrogen; and a mass of oxide of iron, heated to redness in a\r\nstream of hydrogen, forms iron and steam), does not proceed in virtue\r\nof the comparatively small difference between the affinity of oxygen\r\nfor iron (or zinc) and for hydrogen, but only because the hydrogen\r\nescapes, as it is formed, in virtue of its elasticity.[11] If the\r\noxygen compounds--that is, the oxides--which are obtained from the\r\niron or zinc, be able to pass into solution, then the affinity acting\r\nin solution is added, and the reaction may become non-reversible, and\r\nproceed with comparatively much greater facility.[12] As the oxides\r\nof iron and zinc, by themselves insoluble in water, are capable\r\nof combining with (have an affinity for) acid oxides (as we shall\r\nafterwards fully consider), and form saline and soluble substances, with\r\nacids, or hydrates having acid properties, hence by the action of such\r\nhydrates, or of their aqueous solutions,[13] iron and zinc are able to\r\nliberate hydrogen with great ease at the ordinary temperature--that\r\nis, they act on solutions of acids just as sodium acts on water.[14]\r\nSulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, is usually chosen for this purpose; the\r\nhydrogen is displaced from it by many metals with much greater facility\r\nthan directly from water, and such a displacement is accompanied by\r\nthe evolution of a large amount of heat.[15] When the hydrogen in\r\nsulphuric acid is replaced by a metal, a substance is obtained which is\r\ncalled a salt of sulphuric acid or a sulphate. Thus, by the action of\r\nzinc on sulphuric acid, hydrogen and zinc sulphate ZnSO_{4},[15 bis]\r\nare obtained. The latter is a solid substance, soluble in water. In\r\norder that the action of the metal on the acid should go on regularly,\r\nand to the end, it is necessary that the acid should be diluted with\r\nwater, which dissolves the salt as it is formed; otherwise the salt\r\ncovers the metal, and hinders the acid from attacking it. Usually the\r\nacid is diluted with from three to five times its volume of water, and\r\nthe metal is covered with this solution. In order that the metal should\r\nact rapidly on the acid, it should present a large surface, so that a\r\nmaximum amount of the reacting substances may come into contact in a\r\ngiven time. For this purpose the zinc is used as strips of sheet zinc,\r\nor in the granulated form (that is, zinc which has been poured from a\r\ncertain height, in a molten state, into water). The iron should be in\r\nthe form of wire, nails, filings, or cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Apparatus for the preparation of hydrogen from\r\nzinc and sulphuric acid.]\r\n\r\n  [10] The composition of water, as we saw above, was determined by\r\n       passing steam over red-hot iron; the same method has been used\r\n       for making hydrogen for filling balloons. An oxide having the\r\n       composition Fe_{3}O_{4} is formed in the reaction, so that it is\r\n       expressed by the equation 3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.\r\n\r\n  [11] The reaction between iron and water (note 10) is reversible. By\r\n       heating the oxide in a current of hydrogen, water and iron are\r\n       obtained. From this it follows, from the principle of chemical\r\n       equilibria, that if iron and hydrogen be taken, and also oxygen,\r\n       but in such a quantity that it is insufficient for combination\r\n       with both substances, then it will divide itself between the two;\r\n       part of it will combine with the iron and the other part with\r\n       the hydrogen, but a portion of both will remain in an uncombined\r\n       state.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, if iron and water be placed in a closed space,\r\n       decomposition of the water will proceed on heating to the\r\n       temperature at which the reaction 3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} +\r\n       8H commences; but it ceases, does not go on to the end, because\r\n       the conditions for a reverse reaction are attained, and a state\r\n       of equilibrium will ensue after the decomposition of a certain\r\n       quantity of water. Here again (_see_ note 9) the reversibility is\r\n       connected with the small heat effect, and again both reactions\r\n       (direct and reverse) proceed at a red heat. But if, in the\r\n       above-described reaction, the hydrogen escapes as it is evolved,\r\n       then its partial pressure does not increase with its formation,\r\n       and therefore all the iron can he oxidised by the water. In\r\n       this we see the elements of that influence of mass to which we\r\n       shall have occasion to return later. With copper and lead there\r\n       will be no decomposition, either at the ordinary or at a high\r\n       temperature, because the affinity of these metals for oxygen is\r\n       much less than that of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [12] In general, if reversible as well as non-reversible reactions\r\n       can take place between substances acting on each other, then,\r\n       judging by our present knowledge, the non-reversible reactions\r\n       take place in the majority of cases, which obliges one to\r\n       acknowledge the action, in this case, of comparatively strong\r\n       affinities. The reaction, Zn + H_{2}SO_{4} = H_{2} + ZnSO_{4},\r\n       which takes place in solutions at the ordinary temperature, is\r\n       scarcely reversible under these conditions, but at a certain high\r\n       temperature it becomes reversible, because at this temperature\r\n       zinc sulphate and sulphuric acid split up, and the action must\r\n       take place between the water and zinc. From the preceding\r\n       proposition results proceed which are in some cases verified\r\n       by experiment. If the action of zinc or iron on a solution of\r\n       sulphuric acid presents a non-reversible reaction, then we may\r\n       by this means obtain hydrogen in a very compressed state, and\r\n       compressed hydrogen will not act on solutions of sulphates of\r\n       the above-named metals. This is verified in reality as far as\r\n       was possible in the experiments to keep up the compression or\r\n       pressure of the hydrogen. Those metals which do not evolve\r\n       hydrogen with acids, on the contrary, should, at least at an\r\n       increase of pressure, be displaced by hydrogen. And in fact\r\n       Brunner showed that gaseous hydrogen displaces platinum and\r\n       palladium from the aqueous solutions of their chlorine compounds,\r\n       but not gold, and Beketoff succeeded in showing that silver and\r\n       mercury, under a considerable pressure, are separated from the\r\n       solutions of certain of their compounds by means of hydrogen.\r\n       Reaction already commences under a pressure of six atmospheres,\r\n       if a weak solution of silver sulphate be taken; with a stronger\r\n       solution a much greater pressure is required, however, for the\r\n       separation of the silver.\r\n\r\n  [13] For the same reason, many metals in acting on solutions of the\r\n       alkalis displace hydrogen. Aluminium acts particularly clearly\r\n       in this respect, because its oxide gives a soluble compound with\r\n       alkalis. For the same reason tin, in acting on hydrochloric acid,\r\n       evolves hydrogen, and silicon does the same with hydrofluoric\r\n       acid. It is evident that in such cases the sum of all the\r\n       affinities plays a part; for instance, taking the action of\r\n       zinc on sulphuric acid, we have the affinity of zinc for oxygen\r\n       (forming zinc oxide, ZnO), the affinity of its oxide for\r\n       sulphuric anhydride, SO_{3} (forming zinc sulphate, ZnSO_{4}),\r\n       and the affinity of the resultant salt, ZnSO_{4}, for water.\r\n       It is only the first-named affinity that acts in the reaction\r\n       between water and the metal, if no account is taken of those\r\n       forces (of a physico-mechanical character) which act between the\r\n       molecules (for instance, the cohesion between the molecules of\r\n       the oxide) and those forces (of a chemical character) which act\r\n       between the atoms forming the molecule, for instance, between\r\n       the atoms of hydrogen giving the molecule H_{2} containing two\r\n       atoms. I consider it necessary to remark, that the hypothesis of\r\n       the affinity or endeavour of heterogeneous atoms to enter into a\r\n       common system and in harmonious motion (_i.e._ to form a compound\r\n       molecule) must inevitably be in accordance with the hypothesis of\r\n       forces including homogeneous atoms to form complex molecules (for\r\n       instance, H_{2}), and to build up the latter into solid or liquid\r\n       substances, in which the existence of an attraction between the\r\n       homogeneous particles must certainly be admitted. Therefore,\r\n       those forces which bring about solution must also be taken into\r\n       consideration. These are all forces of one and the same series,\r\n       and in this may be seen the great difficulties surrounding the\r\n       study of molecular mechanics and its province--chemical mechanics.\r\n\r\n  [14] It is acknowledged that zinc itself acts on water, even at the\r\n       ordinary temperature, but that the action is confined to small\r\n       masses and only proceeds at the surface. In reality, zinc, in the\r\n       form of a very fine powder, or so-called 'zinc dust,' is capable\r\n       of decomposing water with the formation of oxide (hydrated) and\r\n       hydrogen. The oxide formed acts on sulphuric acid, water then\r\n       dissolves the salt produced, and the action continues because\r\n       one of the products of the action of water on zinc, zinc oxide,\r\n       is removed from the surface. One might naturally imagine that\r\n       the reaction does not proceed directly between the metal and\r\n       water, but between the metal and the acid, but such a simple\r\n       representation, which we shall cite afterwards, hides the\r\n       mechanism of the reaction, and does not permit of its actual\r\n       complexity being seen.\r\n\r\n  [15] According to Thomsen the reaction between zinc and a very weak\r\n       solution of sulphuric acid evolves about 38,000 calories (zinc\r\n       sulphate being formed) per 65 parts by weight of zinc; and 56\r\n       parts by weight of iron--which combine, like 65 parts by weight\r\n       of zinc, with 16 parts by weight of oxygen--evolve about 25,000\r\n       calories (forming ferrous sulphate, FeSO_{4}). Paracelsus\r\n       observed the action of metals on acids in the seventeenth\r\n       century; but it was not until the eighteenth century that Lémery\r\n       determined that the gas which is evolved in this action is a\r\n       particular one which differs from air and is capable of burning.\r\n       Even Boyle confused it with air. Cavendish determined the chief\r\n       properties of the gas discovered by Paracelsus. At first it was\r\n       called 'inflammable air'; later, when it was recognised that in\r\n       burning it gives water, it was called hydrogen, from the Greek\r\n       words for water and generator.\r\n\r\n  [15 bis] If, when the sulphuric acid is poured over the zinc, the\r\n      evolution of the hydrogen proceed too slowly, it may be greatly\r\n      accelerated by adding a small quantity of a solution of CuSO_{4}\r\n      or PtCl_{4} to the acid. The reason of this is explained in Chap.\r\n      XVI., note 10 bis.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of obtaining hydrogen is as follows:--A certain\r\nquantity of granulated zinc is put into a double-necked, or Woulfe's,\r\nbottle. Into one neck a funnel is placed, reaching to the bottom of\r\nthe bottle, so that the liquid poured in may prevent the hydrogen from\r\nescaping through it. The gas escapes through a special gas conducting\r\ntube, which is firmly fixed, by a cork, into the other neck, and ends in\r\na water bath (fig. 20), under the orifice of a glass cylinder full of\r\nwater.[16] If sulphuric acid be now poured into the Woulfe's bottle it\r\nwill soon be seen that bubbles of a gas are evolved, which is hydrogen.\r\nThe first part of the gas evolved should not be collected, as it is\r\nmixed with the air originally in the apparatus. This precaution should\r\nbe taken in the preparation of all gases. Time must be allowed for the\r\ngas evolved to displace all the air from the apparatus, otherwise in\r\ntesting the combustibility of the hydrogen an explosion may occur from\r\nthe formation of detonating gas (the mixture of the oxygen of the air\r\nwith the hydrogen).[17]\r\n\r\n  [16] As laboratory experiments with gases require a certain preliminary\r\n       knowledge, we will describe certain _practical methods for the\r\n       collection and preparation of gases_. When in laboratory practice\r\n       an intermittent supply of hydrogen (or other gas which is evolved\r\n       without the aid of heat) is required the apparatus represented\r\n       in fig. 21 is the most convenient. It consists of two bottles,\r\n       having orifices at the bottom, in which corks with tubes are\r\n       placed, and these tubes are connected by an india-rubber tube\r\n       (sometimes furnished with a spring clamp). Zinc is placed in one\r\n       bottle, and dilute sulphuric acid in the other. The neck of the\r\n       former is closed by a cork, which is fitted with a gas-conducting\r\n       tube with a stopcock. If the two bottles are connected with each\r\n       other and the stopcock be opened, the acid will flow to the zinc\r\n       and evolve hydrogen. If the stopcock be closed, the hydrogen\r\n       will force out the acid from the bottle containing the zinc, and\r\n       the action will cease. Or the vessel containing the acid may be\r\n       placed at a lower level than that containing the zinc, when all\r\n       the liquid will flow into it, and in order to start the action\r\n       the acid vessel may be placed on a higher level than the other,\r\n       and the acid will flow to the zinc. It can also be employed for\r\n       collecting gases (as an aspirator or gasometer).\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 21.--A very convenient apparatus for the\r\n       preparation of gases obtained without heat. It may also replace\r\n       an aspirator or gasometer.]\r\n\r\n       In laboratory practice, however, other forms of apparatus are\r\n       generally employed for exhausting, collecting, and holding gases.\r\n       We will here cite the most usual forms. An _aspirator_ usually\r\n       consists of a vessel furnished with a stopcock at the bottom.\r\n       A stout cork, through which a glass tube passes, is fixed into\r\n       the neck of this vessel. If the vessel be filled up with water\r\n       to the cork and the bottom stopcock is opened, then the water\r\n       will run out and draw gas in. For this purpose the glass tube is\r\n       connected with the apparatus from which it is desired to pump out\r\n       or exhaust the gas.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Continuous aspirator. The tube _d_\r\n       should be more than 32 feet long.]\r\n\r\n       The aspirator represented in fig. 22 may be recommended for its\r\n       continuous action. It consists of a tube _d_ which widens out at\r\n       the top, the lower part being long and narrow. In the expanded\r\n       upper portion _c_, two tubes are sealed; one, _e_, for drawing in\r\n       the gas, whilst the other, _b_, is connected to the water supply\r\n       _w_. The amount of water supplied through the tube _b_ must be\r\n       less than the amount which can be carried off by the tube _d_.\r\n       Owing to this the water in the tube _d_ will flow through it in\r\n       cylinders alternating with cylinders of gas, which will be thus\r\n       carried away. The gas which is drawn through may be collected\r\n       from the end of the tube _d_, but this form of pump is usually\r\n       employed where the air or gas aspirated is not to be collected.\r\n       If the tube _d_ is of considerable length, say 40 ft. or more,\r\n       a very fair vacuum will be produced, the amount of which is\r\n       shown by the gauge _g_; it is often used for filtering under\r\n       reduced pressure, as shown in the figure. If water be replaced by\r\n       mercury, and the length of the tube _d_ be greater than 760 mm.,\r\n       the aspirator may be employed as an air-pump, and all the air may\r\n       be exhausted from a limited space; for instance, by connecting\r\n       _g_ with a hollow sphere.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Gasholder.]\r\n\r\n       _Gasholders_ are often used for collecting and holding gases.\r\n       They are made of glass, copper, or tin plate. The usual form\r\n       is shown in fig. 23. The lower vessel _B_ is made hermetically\r\n       tight--_i.e._, impervious to gases--and is filled with water.\r\n       A funnel is attached to this vessel (on several supports).\r\n       The vessel _B_ communicates with the bottom of the funnel by\r\n       a stopcock _b_ and a tube _a_, reaching to the bottom of the\r\n       vessel _B_. If water be poured into the funnel and the stopcocks\r\n       _a_ and _b_ opened, the water will run through _a_, and the air\r\n       escape from the vessel _B_ by _b_. A glass tube _f_ runs up the\r\n       side of the vessel _B_, with which it communicates at the top\r\n       and bottom, and shows the amount of water and gas the gasholder\r\n       contains. In order to fill the gasholder with a gas, it is first\r\n       filled with water, the cocks _a_, _b_ and _e_ are closed, the nut\r\n       _d_ unscrewed, and the end of the tube conducting the gas from\r\n       the apparatus in which it is generated is passed into _d_. As\r\n       the gas fills the gasholder, the water runs out at _d_. If the\r\n       pressure of a gas be not greater than the atmospheric pressure\r\n       and it be required to collect it in the gasholder, then the\r\n       stopcock _e_ is put into communication with the space containing\r\n       the gas. Then, having opened the orifice _d_, the gasholder\r\n       acts like an aspirator; the gas will pass through _e_, and the\r\n       water run out at _d_. If the cocks be closed, the gas collected\r\n       in the gasholder may be easily preserved and transported. If\r\n       it be desired to transfer this gas into another vessel, then a\r\n       gas-conducting tube is attached to _e_, the cock _a_ opened, _b_\r\n       and _d_ closed, and the gas will then pass out at _e_, owing to\r\n       its pressure in the apparatus being greater than the atmospheric\r\n       pressure, due to the pressure of the water poured into the\r\n       funnel. If it be required to fill a cylinder or flask with the\r\n       gas, it is filled with water and inverted in the funnel, and the\r\n       stopcocks _b_ and _a_ opened. Then water will run through _a_,\r\n       and the gas will escape from the gasholder into the cylinder\r\n       through _b_.\r\n\r\n  [17] When it is required to prepare hydrogen in large quantities for\r\n       filling balloons, copper vessels or wooden casks lined with\r\n       lead are employed; they are filled with scrap iron, over which\r\n       dilute sulphuric acid is poured. The hydrogen generated from a\r\n       number of casks is carried through lead pipes into special casks\r\n       containing water (in order to cool the gas) and lime (in order\r\n       to remove acid fumes). To avoid loss of gas all the joints are\r\n       made hermetically tight with cement or tar. In order to fill his\r\n       gigantic balloon (of 25,000 cubic metres capacity), Giffard, in\r\n       1878, constructed a complicated apparatus for giving a continuous\r\n       supply of hydrogen, in which a mixture of sulphuric acid and\r\n       water was continually run into vessels containing iron, and\r\n       from which the solution of iron sulphate formed was continually\r\n       drawn off. When coal gas, extracted from coal, is employed for\r\n       filling balloons, it should be as light, or as rich in hydrogen,\r\n       as possible. For this reason, only the last portions of the\r\n       gas coming from the retorts are collected, and, besides this,\r\n       it is then sometimes passed through red-hot vessels, in order\r\n       to decompose the hydrocarbons as much as possible; charcoal\r\n       is deposited in the red-hot vessels, and hydrogen remains as\r\n       gas. Coal gas may be yet further enriched in hydrogen, and\r\n       consequently rendered lighter, by passing it over an ignited\r\n       mixture of charcoal and lime.\r\n\r\n       L. Mond (London) proposes to manufacture hydrogen on a large\r\n       scale from water gas (_see infra_, and Chapters VIII. and IX.),\r\n       which contains a mixture of oxide of carbon (CO) and hydrogen,\r\n       and is produced by the action of steam upon incandescent coke\r\n       (C + H_{2}O = CO + H_{2}). He destroys the oxide of carbon\r\n       by converting it into carbon and carbonic anhydride (2CO =\r\n       C + CO_{2}), which is easily done by means of incandescent,\r\n       finely-divided metallic nickel; the carbon then remains with\r\n       the nickel, from which it may be removed by burning it in air,\r\n       and the nickel can then be used over again (_see_ Chapter IX.,\r\n       Note 24 bis). The CO_{2} formed is removed from the hydrogen by\r\n       passing it through milk of lime. This process should apparently\r\n       give hydrogen on a large scale more economically than any of the\r\n       methods hitherto proposed.\r\n\r\nHydrogen, besides being contained in water, is also contained in many\r\nother substances,[18] and may be obtained from them. As examples of\r\nthis, it may be mentioned (1) that a mixture of formate of sodium,\r\nCHNaO_{2}, and caustic soda, NaHO, when heated to redness, forms sodium\r\ncarbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and hydrogen, H_{2};[19] (2) that a number of\r\norganic substances are decomposed at a red heat, forming hydrogen, among\r\nother gases, and thus it is that hydrogen is contained in ordinary coal\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n  [18] Of the metals, only a very few combine with hydrogen (for example,\r\n       sodium), and give substances which are easily decomposed. Of\r\n       the non-metals, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine,\r\n       and iodine) most easily form hydrogen compounds; of these the\r\n       hydrogen compound of chlorine, and still more that of fluorine,\r\n       is stable, whilst those of bromine and iodine are easily\r\n       decomposed, especially the latter. The other non-metals--for\r\n       instance, sulphur, carbon, and phosphorus--give hydrogen\r\n       compounds of different composition and properties, but they are\r\n       all less stable than water. The number of the carbon compounds of\r\n       hydrogen is enormous, but there are very few among them which are\r\n       not decomposed, with separation of the carbon and hydrogen, at a\r\n       red heat.\r\n\r\n  [19] The reaction expressed by the equation CNaHO_{2} + NaHO =\r\n       CNa_{2}O_{3} + H_{2} may be effected in a glass vessel, like\r\n       the decomposition of copper carbonate or mercury oxide (_see_\r\n       Introduction); it is non-reversible, and takes place without the\r\n       presence of water, and therefore Pictet (_see_ later) made use of\r\n       it to obtain hydrogen under great pressure.\r\n\r\nCharcoal itself liberates hydrogen from steam at a high temperature;[20]\r\nbut the reaction which here takes place is distinguished by a certain\r\ncomplexity, and will therefore be considered later.\r\n\r\n  [20] The reaction between charcoal and superheated steam is a double\r\n       one--that is, there may be formed either carbonic oxide, CO\r\n       (according to the equation H_{2}O + C = H_{2} + CO), or carbonic\r\n       anhydride CO_{2} (according to the equation 2H_{2}O + C = 2H_{2}\r\n       + CO_{2}), and the resulting mixture is called _water-gas_; we\r\n       shall speak of it in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n_The properties of hydrogen._--Hydrogen presents us with an example\r\nof a gas which at first sight does not differ from air. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that Paracelsus, having discovered that an\r\naëriform substance is obtained by the action of metals on sulphuric\r\nacid, did not determine exactly its difference from air. In fact,\r\nhydrogen, like air, is colourless, and has no smell;[21] but a more\r\nintimate acquaintance with its properties proves it to be entirely\r\ndifferent from air. The first sign which distinguishes hydrogen from\r\nair is its combustibility. This property is so easily observed that\r\nit is the one to which recourse is usually had in order to recognise\r\nhydrogen, if it is evolved in a reaction, although there are many other\r\ncombustible gases. But before speaking of the combustibility and other\r\nchemical properties of hydrogen, we will first describe the physical\r\nproperties of this gas, as we did in the case of water. It is easy to\r\nshow that it is one of the lightest gases.[22] If passed into the bottom\r\nof a flask full of air, hydrogen will not remain in it, but, owing\r\nto its lightness, rapidly escapes and mixes with the atmosphere. If,\r\nhowever, a cylinder whose orifice is turned downwards be filled with\r\nhydrogen, it will not escape, or, more correctly, it will only slowly\r\nmix with the atmosphere. This may be demonstrated by the fact that a\r\nlighted taper sets fire to the hydrogen at the orifice of the cylinder,\r\nand is itself extinguished inside the cylinder. Hence, hydrogen, being\r\nitself combustible, does not support combustion. The great lightness\r\nof hydrogen is taken advantage of for balloons. Ordinary coal gas,\r\nwhich is often also used for the same purpose, is only about twice\r\nas light as air, whilst hydrogen is 14-1/2 times lighter than air.\r\nA very simple experiment with soap bubbles very well illustrates the\r\napplication of hydrogen for filling balloons. Charles, of Paris, showed\r\nthe lightness of hydrogen in this way, and constructed a balloon filled\r\nwith hydrogen almost simultaneously with Montgolfier. One litre of pure\r\nand dry hydrogen[23] at 0° and 760 mm. pressure weighs 0·08986 gram;\r\nthat is, hydrogen is almost 14-1/2 (more exactly, 14·39) times lighter\r\nthan air. It is the lightest of all gases. The small density of hydrogen\r\ndetermines many remarkable properties which it shows; thus, hydrogen\r\npasses exceedingly rapidly through fine orifices, its molecules (Chapter\r\nI.) being endued with the greatest velocity.[24] At pressures somewhat\r\nhigher than the atmospheric pressure, all other gases exhibit a greater\r\ncompressibility and co-efficient of expansion than they should according\r\nto the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac; whilst hydrogen, on the\r\ncontrary, is compressed to a less degree than it should be from the law\r\nof Mariotte,[25] and with a rise of pressure it expands slightly less\r\nthan at the atmospheric pressure.[26] However, hydrogen, like air and\r\nmany other gases which are permanent at the ordinary temperature, does\r\nnot pass into a liquid state under a very considerable pressure,[27] but\r\nis compressed into a lesser volume than would follow from Mariotte's\r\nlaw.[28] From this it may be concluded that the absolute boiling point\r\nof hydrogen, and of gases resembling it,[29] lies very much below the\r\nordinary temperature; that is, that the liquefaction of this _gas_\r\nis only possible at low temperatures, and under great pressures.[30]\r\nThis conclusion was verified (1877) by the experiments of Pictet\r\nand Cailletet.[31] They compressed gases at a very low temperature,\r\nand then allowed them to expand, either by directly decreasing the\r\npressure or by allowing them to escape into the air, by which means\r\nthe temperature fell still lower, and then, just as steam when rapidly\r\nrarefied[32] deposits liquid water in the form of a fog, hydrogen in\r\nexpanding forms a fog, thus indicating its passage into a liquid state.\r\nBut as yet it has been impossible to preserve this liquid, even for a\r\nshort time, to determine its properties, notwithstanding the employment\r\nof a temperature of -200° and a pressure of 200 atmospheres,[33] although\r\nby these means the gases of the atmosphere may be kept in a liquid\r\nstate for a long time. This is due to the fact that the absolute boiling\r\npoint of hydrogen lies lower than that of all other known gases, which\r\nalso depends on the extreme lightness of hydrogen.[34]\r\n\r\n  [21] Hydrogen obtained by the action of zinc or iron on sulphuric acid\r\n       generally smells of hydrogen sulphide (like rotten eggs), which\r\n       it contains in admixture. As a rule such hydrogen is not so\r\n       pure as that obtained by the action of an electric current or\r\n       of sodium on water. The impurity of the hydrogen depends on the\r\n       impurities contained in the zinc, or iron, and sulphuric acid,\r\n       and on secondary reactions which take place simultaneously with\r\n       the main reaction. Impure hydrogen may be easily freed from\r\n       the impurities it contains: some of them--namely, those having\r\n       acid properties--are absorbed by caustic soda, and therefore\r\n       may be removed by passing the hydrogen through a solution of\r\n       this substance; another series of impurities is absorbed by a\r\n       solution of mercuric chloride; and, lastly, a third series is\r\n       absorbed by a solution of potassium permanganate. If absolutely\r\n       _pure hydrogen_ be required, it is sometimes obtained by the\r\n       decomposition of water (previously boiled to expel all air,\r\n       and mixed with pure sulphuric acid) by the galvanic current.\r\n       Only the gas evolved at the negative electrode is collected.\r\n       Or else, an apparatus like that which gives detonating gas is\r\n       used, the positive electrode, however, being immersed under\r\n       mercury containing zinc in solution. The oxygen which is evolved\r\n       at this electrode then immediately, at the moment of its\r\n       evolution, combines with the zinc, and this compound dissolves\r\n       in the sulphuric acid and forms zinc sulphate, which remains in\r\n       solution, and therefore the hydrogen generated will be quite free\r\n       from oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [22] An inverted beaker is attached to one arm of the beam of a\r\n       tolerably sensitive balance, and its weight counterpoised by\r\n       weights in the pan attached to the other arm, If the beaker\r\n       be then filled with hydrogen it rises, owing to the air being\r\n       replaced by hydrogen. Thus, at the ordinary temperature of a\r\n       room, a litre of air weighs about 1·2 gram, and on replacing the\r\n       air by hydrogen a decrease in weight of about 1 gram per litre is\r\n       obtained. Moist hydrogen is heavier than dry--for aqueous vapour\r\n       is nine times heavier than hydrogen. In filling balloons it is\r\n       usually calculated that (it being impossible to have perfectly\r\n       dry hydrogen or to obtain it quite free from air) the lifting\r\n       force due to the difference between the weights of equal volumes\r\n       of hydrogen and air is equal to 1 kilogram (= 1,000 grams) per\r\n       cubic metre (= 1,000 litres).\r\n\r\n  [23] The density of hydrogen in relation to the air has been repeatedly\r\n       determined by accurate experiments. The first determination, made\r\n       by Lavoisier, was not very exact; taking the density of air as\r\n       unity, he obtained 0·0769 for that of hydrogen--that is, hydrogen\r\n       as thirteen times lighter than air. More accurate determinations\r\n       are due to Thomsen, who obtained the figure 0·0693; Berzelius\r\n       and Dulong, who obtained 0·0688; and Dumas and Boussingault, who\r\n       obtained 0·06945. Regnault, and more recently Le Duc (1892),\r\n       took two spheres of considerable capacity, which contained equal\r\n       volumes of air (thus avoiding the necessity of any correction\r\n       for weighing them in air). Both spheres were attached to the\r\n       scale pans of a balance. One was sealed up, and the other first\r\n       weighed empty and then full of hydrogen. Thus, knowing the weight\r\n       of the hydrogen filling the sphere, and the capacity of the\r\n       sphere, it was easy to find the weight of a litre of hydrogen;\r\n       and, knowing the weight of a litre of air at the same temperature\r\n       and pressure, it was easy to calculate the density of hydrogen.\r\n       Regnault, by these experiments, found the average density of\r\n       hydrogen to be 0·06926 in relation to air; Le Duc, 0·06948 (with\r\n       a possible error of ±0·00001), and this latter figure must now be\r\n       looked upon as near to the truth.\r\n\r\n       In this work I shall always refer the densities of all gases to\r\n       hydrogen, and not to air; I will therefore give, for the sake of\r\n       clearness, the weight of a litre of dry pure hydrogen in grams\r\n       at a temperature _t_° and under a pressure _H_ (measured in\r\n       millimetres of mercury at 0°, in lat. 45°). The weight of a litre\r\n       of hydrogen\r\n\r\n            = 0·08986 × (_H_/760) × 1/(1 + 0·00367_t_) gram.\r\n\r\n       For aëronauts it is very useful to know, besides this, the\r\n       weight of the air at different heights, and I therefore insert\r\n       the adjoining table, constructed on the basis of Glaisher's\r\n       data, for the temperature and moisture of the atmospheric strata\r\n       in clear weather. All the figures are given in the metrical\r\n       system--1,000 millimetres = 39·37 inches, 1,000 kilograms =\r\n       2204·3375 lbs., 1,000 cubic metres = 35,316·6 cubic feet. The\r\n       starting temperature at the earth's surface is taken as = 15° C.,\r\n       its moisture 60 p.c., pressure 760 millimetres. The pressures\r\n       are taken as indicated by an _aneroid barometer_, assumed to be\r\n       corrected at the sea level and at lat. 45° C. If the height above\r\n       the level of the sea equal _z_ kilometres, then the weight of 1\r\n       cubic metre of air may be approximately taken as 1·222- 0·12_z_ +\r\n       0·00377_z_^2 kilogram.\r\n\r\n       +--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------------------+\r\n       |Pressure|Temperature|Moisture| Height | Weight of the air  |\r\n       |        |           |        |(metres)|(1,000 cubic metres)|\r\n       |--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------------------+\r\n       | 760 mm.|  15°   C. | 60 p.c.|     0  |   1222  kilos.     |\r\n       | 700  \" |  11·0° \"  | 64  \"  |   690  |   1141    \"        |\r\n       | 650  \" |   7·6° \"  | 64  \"  |  1300  |   1073    \"        |\r\n       | 600  \" |   4·3° \"  | 63  \"  |  1960  |   1003    \"        |\r\n       | 550  \" |  -1·0° \"  | 62  \"  |  2660  |    931    \"        |\r\n       | 500  \" |  -2·4° \"  | 58  \"  |  3420  |    857    \"        |\r\n       | 450  \" |  -5·8° \"  | 52  \"  |  4250  |    781    \"        |\r\n       | 400  \" |  -9·1° \"  | 44  \"  |  5170  |    703    \"        |\r\n       | 350  \" | -12·5° \"  | 36  \"  |  6190  |    624    \"        |\r\n       | 300  \" | -15·9° \"  | 27  \"  |  7360  |    542    \"        |\r\n       | 250  \" | -19·2° \"  | 18  \"  |  8720  |    457    \"        |\r\n       +--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------------------+\r\n\r\n       Although the figures in this table are calculated with every\r\n       possible care from average data, yet they can only be taken\r\n       approximately, for in every separate case the conditions, both at\r\n       the earth's surface and in the atmosphere, will differ from those\r\n       here taken. In calculating the height to which a balloon can\r\n       ascend, it is evident that the density of gas in relation to air\r\n       must be known. This density for ordinary coal gas is from 0·6 to\r\n       0·35, and for hydrogen with its ordinary contents of moisture and\r\n       air from 0·1 to 0·15.\r\n\r\n       Hence, for instance, it may be calculated that a balloon of 1,000\r\n       cubic metres capacity filled with pure hydrogen, and weighing\r\n       (the envelope, tackle, people, and ballast) 727 kilograms, will\r\n       only ascend to a height of about 4,250 metres.\r\n\r\n  [24] If a cracked flask be filled with hydrogen and its neck immersed\r\n       under water or mercury, then the liquid will rise up into the\r\n       flask, owing to the hydrogen passing through the cracks about 3·8\r\n       times quicker than the air is able to pass through these cracks\r\n       into the flask. The same phenomenon may be better observed if,\r\n       instead of a flask, a tube be employed, whose end is closed by a\r\n       porous substance, such as graphite, unglazed earthenware, or a\r\n       gypsum plate.\r\n\r\n  [25] According to Boyle and Mariotte's law, for a given gas at a\r\n       constant temperature the volume decreases by as many times as\r\n       the pressure increases; that is, this law requires that the\r\n       product of the volume _v_ and the pressure _p_ for a given gas\r\n       should be a constant quantity: _pv_ = _C_, a constant quantity\r\n       which does not vary with a change of pressure. This equation\r\n       does very nearly and exactly express the observed relation\r\n       between the volume and pressure, but only within comparatively\r\n       small variations of pressure, density, and volume. If these\r\n       variations be in any degree considerable, the quantity _pv_\r\n       proves to be dependent on the pressure, and it either increases\r\n       or diminishes with an increase of pressure. In the former case\r\n       the compressibility is less than it should he according to\r\n       Mariotte's law, in the latter case it is greater. We will call\r\n       the first case a positive discrepancy (because then _d(pv)/d(p)_\r\n       is greater than zero), and the second case a negative discrepancy\r\n       (because then _d(pv)/d(p)_ is less than zero). Determinations\r\n       made by myself (in the seventies), M. L. Kirpicheff, and V. A.\r\n       Hemilian showed that all known gases at low pressures--_i.e._\r\n       when considerably rarefied--present positive discrepancies. On\r\n       the other hand, it appears from the researches of Cailletet,\r\n       Natterer, and Amagat that all gases under great pressures (when\r\n       the volume obtained is 500-1,000 times less than under the\r\n       atmospheric pressure) also present positive discrepancies. Thus\r\n       under a pressure of 2,700 atmospheres air is compressed, not\r\n       2,700 times, but only 800, and hydrogen 1,000 times. Hence the\r\n       positive kind of discrepancy is, so to say, normal to gases. And\r\n       this is easily intelligible. If a gas followed Mariotte's law, or\r\n       if it were compressed to a greater extent than is shown by this\r\n       law, then under great pressures it would attain a density greater\r\n       than that of solid and liquid substances, which is in itself\r\n       improbable and even impossible by reason of the fact that solid\r\n       and liquid substances are themselves but little compressible.\r\n       For instance, a cubic centimetre of oxygen at 0° and under the\r\n       atmospheric pressure weighs about 0·0014 gram, and at a pressure\r\n       of 3,000 atmospheres (this pressure is attained in guns) it\r\n       would, if it followed Mariotte's law, weigh 4·2 grams--that is,\r\n       would be about four times heavier than water--and at a pressure\r\n       of 10,000 atmospheres it would be heavier than mercury. Besides\r\n       this, positive discrepancies are probable because the molecules\r\n       of a gas themselves must occupy a certain volume. Considering\r\n       that Mariotte's law, strictly speaking, applies only to the\r\n       intermolecular space, we can understand the necessity of positive\r\n       discrepancies. If we designate the volume of the molecules of a\r\n       gas by _b_ (like van der Waals, _see_ Chap. I., Note 34), then it\r\n       must be expected that _p(v-b) = C_. Hence _pv = C + bp_, which\r\n       expresses a positive discrepancy. Supposing that for hydrogen\r\n       _pv_ = 1,000, at a pressure of one metre of mercury, according to\r\n       the results of Regnault's, Amagat's, and Natterer's experiments,\r\n       we obtain _b_ as approximately 0·7 to 0·9.\r\n\r\n       Thus the increase of _pv_ with the increase of pressure must\r\n       be considered as the normal law of the compressibility of\r\n       gases. Hydrogen presents such a positive compressibility at\r\n       all pressures, for it presents positive discrepancies from\r\n       Mariotte's law, according to Regnault, at all pressures above the\r\n       atmospheric pressure. Hence hydrogen is, so to say, a perfect\r\n       gas. No other gas behaves so simply with a change of pressure.\r\n       All other gases at pressures from 1 to 30 atmospheres present\r\n       negative discrepancies--that is, they are then compressed to a\r\n       greater degree than should follow from Mariotte's law, as was\r\n       shown by the determinations of Regnault, which were verified\r\n       when repeated by myself and Boguzsky. Thus, for example, on\r\n       changing the pressure from 4 to 20 metres of mercury--that is,\r\n       on increasing the pressure five times--the volume only decreased\r\n       4·93 times when hydrogen was taken, and 5·06 when air was taken.\r\n\r\n       The positive discrepancies from the law at low pressures are\r\n       of particular interest, and, according to the above-mentioned\r\n       determinations made by myself, Kirpicheff, and Hemilian, and\r\n       verified (by two methods) by K. D. Kraevitch and Prof. Ramsay\r\n       (London, 1894), they are proper to all gases (even to those which\r\n       are easily compressed into a liquid state, such as carbonic and\r\n       sulphurous anhydrides). These discrepancies approach the case\r\n       of a very high rarefaction of gases, where a gas is near to a\r\n       condition of maximum dispersion of its molecules, and perhaps\r\n       presents a passage towards the substance termed 'luminiferous\r\n       ether' which fills up interplanetary and interstellar space. If\r\n       we suppose that gases are rarefiable to a definite limit only,\r\n       having attained which they (like solids) do not alter in volume\r\n       with a decrease of pressure, then on the one hand the passage of\r\n       the atmosphere at its upper limits into a homogeneous ethereal\r\n       medium becomes comprehensible, and on the other hand it would be\r\n       expected that gases would, in a state of high rarefaction (_i.e._\r\n       when small masses of gases occupy large volumes, or when furthest\r\n       removed from a liquid state), present positive discrepancies from\r\n       Boyle and Mariotte's law. Our present acquaintance with this\r\n       province of highly rarefied gases is very limited (because direct\r\n       measurements are exceedingly difficult to make, and are hampered\r\n       by possible errors of experiment, which may be considerable), and\r\n       its further development promises to elucidate much in respect to\r\n       natural phenomena. To the three states of matter (solid, liquid,\r\n       and gaseous) it is evident a fourth must yet be added, the\r\n       ethereal or ultra-gaseous (as Crookes proposed), understanding by\r\n       this, matter in its highest possible state of rarefaction.\r\n\r\n  [26] The law of Gay-Lussac states that all gases in all conditions\r\n       present one coefficient of expansion 0·00367; that is, when\r\n       heated from 0° to 100° they expand like air; namely, a thousand\r\n       volumes of a gas measured at 0° will occupy 1367 volumes at\r\n       100°. Regnault, about 1850, showed that Gay-Lussac's law is not\r\n       entirely correct, and that different gases, and also one and\r\n       the same gas at different pressures, have not quite the same\r\n       coefficients of expansion. Thus the expansion of air between 0°\r\n       and 100° is 0·367 under the ordinary pressure of one atmosphere,\r\n       and at three atmospheres it is 0·371, the expansion of hydrogen\r\n       is 0·366, and of carbonic anhydride 0·37. Regnault, however,\r\n       did not directly determine the change of volume between 0° and\r\n       100°, but measured the variation of tension with the change of\r\n       temperature; but since gases do not entirely follow Mariotte's\r\n       law, the change of volume cannot be directly judged by the\r\n       variation of tension. The investigations carried on by myself and\r\n       Kayander, about 1870, showed the variation of volume on heating\r\n       from 0° to 100° under a constant pressure. These investigations\r\n       confirmed Regnault's conclusion that Gay-Lussac's law is not\r\n       entirely correct, and further showed (1) that the expansion\r\n       per volume from 0° to 100° under a pressure of one atmosphere,\r\n       for air = 0·368, for hydrogen = 0·367, for carbonic anhydride\r\n       = 0·373, for hydrogen bromide = 0·386, &c.; (2) that for gases\r\n       which are more compressible than should follow from Mariotte's\r\n       law the expansion by heat increases with the pressure--for\r\n       example, for air at a pressure of three and a half atmospheres,\r\n       it equals 0·371, for carbonic anhydride at one atmosphere\r\n       it equals 0·373, at three atmospheres 0·389, and at eight\r\n       atmospheres 0·413; (3) that for gases which are less compressible\r\n       than should follow from Mariotte's law, the expansion by heat\r\n       decreases with an increase of pressure--for example, for hydrogen\r\n       at one atmosphere 0·367, at eight atmospheres 0·369, for air\r\n       at a quarter of an atmosphere 0·370, at one atmosphere 0·368;\r\n       and hydrogen like _air_ (and all gases) is less compressed _at\r\n       low pressures_ than should follow from Mariotte's law (_see_\r\n       Note 25). Hence, hydrogen, starting from zero to the highest\r\n       pressures, exhibits a gradually, although only slightly, varying\r\n       coefficient of expansion, whilst for air and other gases at the\r\n       atmospheric and higher pressures, the coefficient of expansion\r\n       increases with the increase of pressure, so long as their\r\n       compressibility is greater than should follow from Mariotte's\r\n       law. But when at considerable pressures, this kind of discrepancy\r\n       passes into the normal (_see_ Note 25), then the coefficient of\r\n       expansion of all gases decreases with an increase of pressure,\r\n       as is seen from the researches of Amagat. The difference between\r\n       the two coefficients of expansion, for a constant pressure\r\n       and for a constant volume, is explained by these relations.\r\n       Thus, for example, for air at a pressure of one atmosphere the\r\n       true coefficient of expansion (the volume varying at constant\r\n       pressure) = 0·00368 (according to Mendeléeff and Kayander) and\r\n       the variation of tension (at a constant volume, according to\r\n       Regnault) = 0·00367.\r\n\r\n  [27] Permanent gases are those which cannot be liquefied by an increase\r\n       of pressure alone. With a rise of temperature, all gases and\r\n       vapours become permanent gases. As we shall afterwards learn,\r\n       carbonic anhydride becomes a permanent gas at temperatures above\r\n       31°, and at lower temperatures it has a maximum tension, and may\r\n       be liquefied by pressure alone.\r\n\r\n       _The liquefaction_ of gases, accomplished by Faraday (_see_\r\n       Ammonia, Chapter VI.) and others, in the first half of this\r\n       century, showed that a number of substances are capable, like\r\n       water, of taking all three physical states, and that there is\r\n       no essential difference between vapours and gases, the only\r\n       distinction being that the boiling points (or the temperature\r\n       at which the tension = 760 mm.) of liquids lie above the\r\n       ordinary temperature, and those of liquefied gases below, and\r\n       consequently a gas is a superheated vapour, or vapour heated\r\n       above the boiling point, or removed from saturation, rarefied,\r\n       having a lower tension than that maximum which is proper to a\r\n       given temperature and substance. We will here cite the _maximum\r\n       tensions_ of certain liquids and gases _at various temperatures_,\r\n       because they may be taken advantage of for obtaining constant\r\n       temperatures by changing the pressure at which boiling or the\r\n       formation of saturated vapours takes place. (I may remark that\r\n       the dependence between the tension of the saturated vapours of\r\n       various substances and the temperature is very complex, and\r\n       usually requires three or four independent constants, which\r\n       vary with the nature of the substance, and are found from the\r\n       dependence of the tension _p_ on the temperature _t_ given\r\n       by experiment; but in 1892 K. D. Kraevitch showed that this\r\n       dependence is determined by the properties of a substance, such\r\n       as its density, specific heat, and latent heat of evaporation.)\r\n       The temperatures (according to the air thermometer) are placed\r\n       on the left, and the tension in millimetres of mercury (at 0°)\r\n       on the right-hand side of the equations.

The methods\r\n       of liquefying gases (by pressure and cold) will be described\r\n       under ammonia, nitrous oxide, sulphurous anhydride, and in later\r\n       footnotes. We will now turn our attention to the fact that the\r\n       evaporation of volatile liquids, under various, and especially\r\n       under low, pressures, gives an easy means for obtaining _low\r\n       temperatures_. Thus liquefied carbonic anhydride, under the\r\n       ordinary pressure, reduces the temperature to -80°, and when it\r\n       evaporates in a rarefied atmosphere (under an air-pump) to 25 mm.\r\n       (= 0·033 atmosphere) the temperature, judging by the above-cited\r\n       figures, falls to -115° (Dewar). Even the evaporation of liquids\r\n       of common occurrence, under low pressures easily attainable with\r\n       an air-pump, may produce low temperatures, which may be again\r\n       taken advantage of for obtaining still lower temperatures. Water\r\n       boiling in a vacuum becomes cold, and under a pressure of less\r\n       than 4·5 mm. it freezes, because its tension at 0° is 4·5 mm.\r\n       A sufficiently low temperature may be obtained by forcing fine\r\n       streams of air through common ether, or liquid carbon bisulphide,\r\n       CS_{2}, or methyl chloride, CH_{3}Cl, and other similar volatile\r\n       liquids. In the adjoining table are given, for certain gases, (1)\r\n       the number of atmospheres necessary for their liquefaction at\r\n       15°, and (2) the boiling points of the resultant liquids under a\r\n       pressure of 760 mm.\r\n\r\n                   C_{2}H_{4}  N_{2}O  CO_{2},  H_{2}S\r\n                  (1)    42          31     52      10\r\n                  (2)  -103°        -92°   -80°    -74°\r\n\r\n           AsH_{3},  NH_{3}  HCl  CH_{3}Cl  C_{2}N_{2}  SO_{2}\r\n          (1)   8         7      25       4        4         3\r\n          (2) -58°      -38°    -35°    -24°     -21°      -10°\r\n\r\n  [28] Natterer's determinations (1851-1854), together with Amagat's\r\n       results (1880-1888), show that the compressibility of hydrogen,\r\n       under high pressures, may be expressed by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n                  _p_   =     1     100    1000    2500\r\n                  _v_   =     1  0·0107  0·0019  0·0013\r\n                  _pv_  =     1    1·07     1·9    3·25\r\n                  _s_   =  0·11    10·3      58      85\r\n\r\n       where _p_ = the pressure in metres of mercury, _v_ = the volume,\r\n       if the volume taken under a pressure of 1 metre = 1, and _s_\r\n       the weight of a litre of hydrogen at 20° in grams. If hydrogen\r\n       followed Mariotte's law, then under a pressure of 2,500 metres,\r\n       one litre would contain not 85, but 265 grams. It is evident\r\n       from the above figures that the weight of a litre of the gas\r\n       approaches a limit as the pressure increases, which is doubtless\r\n       the density of the gas when liquefied, and therefore the weight\r\n       of a litre of liquid hydrogen will probably be near 100 grams\r\n       (density about 0·1, being less than that of all other liquids).\r\n\r\n  [29] Cagniard de Latour, on heating ether in a closed tube to about\r\n       190°, observed that at this temperature the liquid is transformed\r\n       into vapour occupying the original volume--that is, having the\r\n       same density as the liquid. The further investigations made by\r\n       Drion and myself showed that every liquid has such an _absolute\r\n       boiling point_, above which it cannot exist as a liquid and\r\n       is transformed into a dense gas. In order to grasp the true\r\n       signification of this absolute boiling temperature, it must be\r\n       remembered that the liquid state is characterised by a cohesion\r\n       of its particles which does not exist in vapours and gases. The\r\n       cohesion of liquids is expressed in their capillary phenomena\r\n       (the breaks in a column of liquid, drop formation, and rise\r\n       in capillary tubes, &c.), and the product of the density of a\r\n       liquid into the height to which it rises in a capillary tube (of\r\n       a definite diameter) may serve as the measure of the magnitude\r\n       of cohesion. Thus, in a tube of 1 mm. diameter, water at 15°\r\n       rises (the height being corrected for the meniscus) 14·8 mm.,\r\n       and ether at _t°_ to a height 5·35-0·028_t°_ mm. The cohesion\r\n       of a liquid is lessened by heating, and therefore the capillary\r\n       heights are also diminished. It has been shown by experiment that\r\n       this decrement is proportional to the temperature, and hence by\r\n       the aid of capillary observations we are able to form an idea\r\n       that at a certain rise of temperature the cohesion may become =\r\n       0. For ether, according to the above formula, this would occur\r\n       at 191°. If the cohesion disappear from a liquid it becomes a\r\n       gas, for cohesion is the only point of difference between these\r\n       two states. A liquid in evaporating and overcoming the force of\r\n       cohesion absorbs heat. Therefore, the absolute boiling point was\r\n       defined by me (1861) as that temperature at which (_a_) a liquid\r\n       cannot exist as a liquid, but forms a gas which cannot pass into\r\n       a liquid state under any pressure whatever; (_b_) cohesion = 0;\r\n       and (_c_) the latent heat of evaporation = 0.\r\n\r\n       This definition was but little known until Andrews (1869)\r\n       explained the matter from another aspect. Starting from gases,\r\n       he discovered that carbonic anhydride cannot be liquefied by any\r\n       degree of compression at temperatures above 31°, whilst at lower\r\n       temperatures it can be liquefied. He called this temperature the\r\n       _critical temperature_. It is evident that it is the same as\r\n       the absolute boiling point. We shall afterwards designate it by\r\n       _tc_. At low temperatures a gas which is subjected to a pressure\r\n       greater than its maximum tension (Note 27) is transformed into\r\n       a liquid, which, in evaporating, gives a saturated vapour\r\n       possessing this maximum tension; whilst at temperatures above\r\n       tc the pressure to which the gas is subjected may increase\r\n       indefinitely. However, under these conditions the volume of the\r\n       gas does not change indefinitely but approaches a definite limit\r\n       (_see_ Note 28)--that is, it resembles in this respect a liquid\r\n       or a solid which is altered but little in volume by pressure.\r\n       The volume which a liquid or gas occupies at _tc_ is termed the\r\n       _critical volume_, and corresponds with the _critical pressure_,\r\n       which we will designate by _pc_ and express in atmospheres. It\r\n       is evident from what has been said that the discrepancies from\r\n       Mariotte and Boyle's law, the absolute boiling point, the density\r\n       in liquid and compressed gaseous states, and the properties of\r\n       liquids, must all he intimately connected together. We will\r\n       consider these relations in one of the following notes. At\r\n       present we will supplement the above observations by the values\r\n       of _tc_ and _pc_ for certain liquids and gases which have been\r\n       investigated in this respect--\r\n\r\n       +---------------------+------++----------------------+------+\r\n       |                _tc_ | _pc_ ||                _tc_  | _pc_ |\r\n       +---------------------+------++----------------------+------+\r\n       | N_{2}         -146° |  33  || H_{2}S        +108°  |  92  |\r\n       | CO            -140° |  39  || C_{2}N_{2}    +124°  |  62  |\r\n       | O_{2}         -119° |  50  || NH_{3}        +131°  | 114  |\r\n       | CH_{4}        -100° |  50  || CH_{3}Cl      +141°  |  73  |\r\n       | NO             -93° |  71  || SO_{2}        +155°  |  79  |\r\n       | C_{2}H_{4}     +10° |  51  || C_{5}H_{10}   +192°  |  34  |\r\n       | CO_{2}         +32° |  77  || C_{4}H_{10}O  +193°  |  40  |\r\n       | N_{2}O         +53° |  75  || CHCl_{3}      +268°  |  55  |\r\n       | C_{2}H_{2}     +37° |  68  || CS_{2}        +278°  |  78  |\r\n       | HCl            +52° |  86  || C_{6}H_{6}    +292°  |  60  |\r\n       | H_{2}O        +365° | 200  || C_{6}H_{5}F   +287°  |  45  |\r\n       | CH_{3}OH      +240° |  79  || C_{6}H_{5}Cl  +360°  |  45  |\r\n       | C_{2}H_{5}OH  +243° |  63  || C_{6}H_{5}Br  +397°  |  45  |\r\n       | CH_{3}COOH    +322° |  57  || C_{6}H_{5}I   +448°  |  45  |\r\n       +---------------------+------++----------------------+------+\r\n\r\n       Young and Guy (1891) showed that _tc_ and _pc_ clearly depend\r\n       upon the composition and molecular weight.\r\n\r\n  [30] I came to this conclusion in 1870 (_Ann. Phys. Chem._ 141, 623).\r\n\r\n  [31] Pictet, in his researches, effected the direct liquefaction of\r\n       many gases which up to that time had not been liquefied. He\r\n       employed the apparatus used for the manufacture of ice on a large\r\n       scale, employing the vaporisation of liquid sulphurous anhydride,\r\n       which may be liquefied by pressure alone. This anhydride is a gas\r\n       which is transformed into a liquid at the ordinary temperature\r\n       under a pressure of several atmospheres (_see_ Note 27), and\r\n       boils at -10° at the ordinary atmospheric pressure. This liquid,\r\n       like all others, boils at a lower temperature under a diminished\r\n       pressure, and by continually pumping out the gas which comes\r\n       off by means of a powerful air-pump its boiling point falls as\r\n       low as -75°. Consequently, if on the one hand we force liquid\r\n       sulphurous anhydride into a vessel, and on the other hand pump\r\n       out the gas from the same vessel by powerful air-pumps, then the\r\n       liquefied gas will boil in the vessel, and cause the temperature\r\n       in it to fall to -75°. If a second vessel is placed inside this\r\n       vessel, then another gas may be easily liquefied in it at the low\r\n       temperature produced by the boiling liquid sulphurous anhydride.\r\n       Pictet in this manner easily liquefied carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}\r\n       (at -60° under a pressure of from four to six atmospheres).\r\n       This gas is more refractory to liquefaction than sulphurous\r\n       anhydride, but for this reason it gives on evaporating a still\r\n       lower temperature than can be attained by the evaporation of\r\n       sulphurous anhydride. A temperature of -80° may be obtained by\r\n       the evaporation of liquid carbonic anhydride at a pressure of\r\n       760 mm., and in an atmosphere rarefied by a powerful pump the\r\n       temperature falls to -140°. By employing such low temperatures, it\r\n       was possible, with the aid of pressure, to liquefy the majority\r\n       of the other gases. It is evident that special pumps which are\r\n       capable of rarefying gases are necessary to reduce the pressure\r\n       in the chambers in which the sulphurous and carbonic anhydride\r\n       boil; and that, in order to re-condense the resultant gases into\r\n       liquids, special force pumps are required for pumping the liquid\r\n       anhydrides into the refrigerating chamber. Thus, in Pictet's\r\n       apparatus (fig. 24), the carbonic anhydride was liquefied by the\r\n       aid of the pumps E F, which compressed the gas (at a pressure of\r\n       4-6 atmospheres) and forced it into the tube K, vigorously cooled\r\n       by being surrounded by boiling liquid sulphurous anhydride, which\r\n       was condensed in the tube C by the pump B, and rarefied by the\r\n       pump A. The liquefied carbonic anhydride flowed down the tube K\r\n       into the tube H, in which it was subjected to a low pressure by\r\n       the pump E, and thus gave a very low temperature of about -140°.\r\n       The pump E carried off the vapour of the carbonic anhydride, and\r\n       conducted it to the pump F, by which it was again liquefied.\r\n       The carbonic anhydride thus made an entire circuit--that\r\n       is, it passed from a rarefied vapour of small tension and\r\n       low temperature into a compressed and cooled gas, which was\r\n       transformed into a liquid, which again vaporised and produced a\r\n       low temperature.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 24.--General arrangement of the apparatus\r\n       employed by Pictet for liquefying gases.]\r\n\r\n       Inside the wide inclined tube H, where the carbonic acid\r\n       evaporated, was placed a second and narrow tube M containing\r\n       hydrogen, which was generated in the vessel L from a mixture of\r\n       sodium formate and caustic soda (CHO_{2}Na + NaHO = Na_{2}CO_{3}\r\n       + H_{2}). This mixture gives hydrogen on heating the vessel L.\r\n       This vessel and the tube M were made of thick copper, and could\r\n       withstand great pressures. They were, moreover, hermetically\r\n       connected together and closed up. Thus the hydrogen which was\r\n       evolved had no outlet, accumulated in a limited space, and its\r\n       pressure increased in proportion to the amount of it evolved.\r\n       This pressure was recorded on a metallic manometer R attached to\r\n       the end of the tube M. As the hydrogen in this tube was submitted\r\n       to a very low temperature and a powerful pressure, all the\r\n       necessary conditions were present for its liquefaction. When the\r\n       pressure in the tube H became steady--_i.e._ when the temperature\r\n       had fallen to -140° and the manometer R indicated a pressure\r\n       of 650 atmospheres in the tube M--then this pressure did not\r\n       rise with a further evolution of hydrogen in the vessel L. This\r\n       served as an indication that the tension of the vapour of the\r\n       hydrogen had attained a maximum corresponding with -140°, and that\r\n       consequently all the excess of the gas was condensed to a liquid.\r\n       Pictet convinced himself of this by opening the cock N, when the\r\n       liquid hydrogen rushed out from the orifice. But, on leaving a\r\n       space where the pressure was equal to 650 atmospheres, and coming\r\n       into contact with air under the ordinary pressure, the liquid or\r\n       powerfully compressed hydrogen expanded, began to boil, absorbed\r\n       still more heat, and became still colder. In doing so a portion\r\n       of the liquid hydrogen, according to Pictet, passed into a solid\r\n       state, and did not fall in drops into a vessel placed under the\r\n       outlet N, but as pieces of solid matter, which struck against\r\n       the sides of the vessel like shot and immediately vaporised.\r\n       Thus, although it was impossible to see and keep the liquefied\r\n       hydrogen, still it was clear that it passed not only into a\r\n       liquid, but also into a solid state. Pictet in his experiments\r\n       obtained other gases which had not previously been liquefied,\r\n       especially oxygen and nitrogen, in a liquid and solid state.\r\n       Pictet supposed that liquid and solid hydrogen has the properties\r\n       of a metal, like iron.\r\n\r\n  [32] At the same time (1879) as Pictet was working on the liquefaction\r\n       of gases in Switzerland, Cailletet, in Paris, was occupied on\r\n       the same subject, and his results, although not so convincing as\r\n       Pictet's, still showed that the majority of gases, previously\r\n       unliquefied, were capable of passing into a liquid state.\r\n       Cailletet subjected gases to a pressure of several hundred\r\n       atmospheres in narrow thick-walled glass tubes (fig. 25); he\r\n       then cooled the compressed gas as far as possible by surrounding\r\n       it with a freezing mixture; a cock was then rapidly opened\r\n       for the outlet of mercury from the tube containing the gas,\r\n       which consequently rapidly and vigorously expanded. This rapid\r\n       expansion of the gas would produce great cold, just as the\r\n       rapid compression of a gas evolves heat and causes a rise in\r\n       temperature. This cold was produced at the expense of the gas\r\n       itself, for in rapidly expanding its particles were not able to\r\n       absorb heat from the walls of the tube, and in cooling a portion\r\n       of the expanding gas was transformed into liquid. This was seen\r\n       from the formation of cloud-like drops like a fog which rendered\r\n       the gas opaque. Thus Cailletet proved the possibility of the\r\n       liquefaction of gases, but he did not isolate the liquids. The\r\n       method of Cailletet allows the passage of gases into liquids\r\n       being observed with greater facility and simplicity than Pictet's\r\n       method, which requires a very complicated and expensive apparatus.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Cailletet's apparatus for liquefying\r\n       gases.]\r\n\r\n       The methods of Pictet and Cailletet were afterwards improved by\r\n       Olszewski, Wroblewski, Dewar, and others. In order to obtain a\r\n       still lower temperature they employed, instead of carbonic acid\r\n       gas, liquid ethylene or nitrogen and oxygen, whose evaporation\r\n       at low pressures produces a much lower temperature (to -200°).\r\n       They also improved on the methods of determining such low\r\n       temperatures, but the methods were not essentially altered; they\r\n       obtained nitrogen and oxygen in a liquid, and nitrogen even in a\r\n       solid, state, but no one has yet succeeded in seeing hydrogen in\r\n       a liquid form.\r\n\r\n       The most illustrative and instructive results (because they\r\n       gave the possibility of maintaining a very low temperature\r\n       and the liquefied gas, even air, for a length of time) were\r\n       obtained in recent years by Prof. Dewar in the Royal Institution\r\n       of London, which is glorified by the names of Davy, Faraday,\r\n       and Tyndall. Dewar, with the aid of powerful pumps, obtained\r\n       many kilograms of oxygen and air (the boiling point under the\r\n       atmospheric pressure =-190°) in a liquid state and kept them in\r\n       this state for a length of time by means of open glass vessels\r\n       with double walls, having a vacuum between them, which prevented\r\n       the rapid transference of heat, and so gave the possibility of\r\n       maintaining very low temperatures inside the vessel for a long\r\n       period of time. The liquefied oxygen or air can be poured from\r\n       one vessel into another and used for any investigations. Thus\r\n       in June 1894, Prof. Dewar showed that at the low temperature\r\n       produced by liquid oxygen many substances become phosphorescent\r\n       (become self-luminous; for instance, oxygen on passing into a\r\n       vacuum) and fluoresce (emit light after being illuminated; for\r\n       instance, paraffin, glue, &c.) much more powerfully than at the\r\n       ordinary temperature; also that solids then greatly alter in\r\n       their mechanical properties, &c. I had the opportunity (1894)\r\n       at Prof. Dewar's of seeing many such experiments in which open\r\n       vessels containing pounds of liquid oxygen were employed, and\r\n       in following the progress made in researches conducted at low\r\n       temperatures, it is my firm impression that the study of many\r\n       phenomena at low temperatures should widen the horizon of natural\r\n       science as much as the investigation of phenomena made at the\r\n       highest temperatures attained in the voltaic arc.\r\n\r\n  [33] The investigations of S. Wroblewski in Cracow give reason to\r\n       believe that Pictet could not have obtained liquid hydrogen in\r\n       the interior of his apparatus, and that if he did obtain it,\r\n       it could only have been at the moment of its outrush due to\r\n       the fall in temperature following its sudden expansion. Pictet\r\n       calculated that he obtained a temperature of -140°, but in reality\r\n       it hardly fell below -120°, judging from the latest data for\r\n       the vaporisation of carbonic anhydride under low pressure. The\r\n       difference lies in the method of determining low temperatures.\r\n       Judging from other properties of hydrogen (_see_ Note 34), one\r\n       would think that its absolute boiling point lies far below -120°,\r\n       and even -140° (according to the calculation of Sarrau, on the\r\n       basis of its compressibility, at -174°). But even at -200° (if the\r\n       methods of determining such low temperatures be correct) hydrogen\r\n       does not give a liquid even under a pressure of several hundred\r\n       atmospheres. However, on expansion a fog is formed and a liquid\r\n       state attained, but the liquid does not separate.\r\n\r\n  [34] After the idea of the absolute temperature of ebullition (_tc_,\r\n       Note 29) had been worked out (about 1870), and its connection\r\n       with the deviations from Mariotte's law had become evident, and\r\n       especially after the liquefaction of permanent gases, general\r\n       attention was turned to the development of the fundamental\r\n       conceptions of the gaseous and liquid states of matter. Some\r\n       investigators directed their energies to the further study of\r\n       vapours (for instance, Ramsay and Young), gases (Amagat), and\r\n       liquids (Zaencheffsky, Nadeschdin, and others), especially to\r\n       liquids near _tc_ and _pc_; others (Konovaloff and De Heen)\r\n       endeavoured to discover the relation between liquids under\r\n       ordinary conditions (removed from _tc_ and _pc_) and gases,\r\n       whilst a third class of investigators (van der Waals, Clausius,\r\n       and others), starting from the generally-accepted principles\r\n       of the mechanical theory of heat and the kinetic theory of\r\n       gases, and assuming in gases the existence of those forces which\r\n       certainly act in liquids, deduced the connection between the\r\n       properties of one and the other. It would be out of place in\r\n       an elementary handbook like the present to enunciate the whole\r\n       mass of conclusions arrived at by this method, but it is well to\r\n       give an idea of the results of van der Waals' considerations,\r\n       for they explain the gradual uninterrupted passage from a liquid\r\n       into a gaseous state in the simplest manner, and, although the\r\n       deduction cannot be considered as complete and decisive (_see_\r\n       Note 25), nevertheless it penetrates so deeply into the essence\r\n       of the matter that its signification is not only reflected in a\r\n       great number of physical investigations, but also in the province\r\n       of chemistry, where instances of the passage of substances from\r\n       a gaseous to a liquid state are so common, and where the very\r\n       processes of dissociation, decomposition, and combination must be\r\n       identified with a change of physical state of the participating\r\n       substances, which has been elaborated by Gibbs, Lavenig, and\r\n       others.\r\n\r\n       For a _given quantity_ (weight, mass) _of a definite substance_,\r\n       its state is expressed by three variables--volume _v_, pressure\r\n       (elasticity, tension) _p_, and temperature _t_. Although the\r\n       compressibility--[_i.e._, _d(v)_/_d(p)_]--of liquids is small,\r\n       still it is clearly expressed, and varies not only with the\r\n       nature of liquids but also with their pressure and temperature\r\n       (at _tc_ the compressibility of liquids is very considerable).\r\n       Although gases, according to Mariotte's law, with small\r\n       variations of pressure, are uniformly compressed, nevertheless\r\n       the dependence of their volume _v_ on _t_ and _p_ is very\r\n       complex. This also applies to the coefficient of expansion [=\r\n       _d(v)_/_d(t)_, or _d(p)_/_d(t)_], which also varies with _t_ and\r\n       _p_, both for gases (_see_ Note 26), and for liquids (at _tc_ it\r\n       is very considerable, and often exceeds that of gases, 0·00367).\r\n       Hence, the _equation of condition_ must include three variables,\r\n       _v_, _p_, and _t_. For a so-called perfect (ideal) gas, or for\r\n       inconsiderable variations of density, the elementary expression\r\n       _pv_ = _R_[Greek: a](1 + [Greek: a]_t_), or _pv_ = _R_(273 + _t_)\r\n       should be accepted, where _R_ is a constant varying with the mass\r\n       and nature of a gas, as expressing this dependence, because it\r\n       includes in itself the laws of Gay-Lussac and Mariotte, for at a\r\n       constant pressure the volume varies proportionally to\r\n       1 + [Greek: a]_t_, and when _t_ is constant the product of _tv_ is\r\n       constant. In its simplest form the equation may be expressed thus:\r\n\r\n                              _pv_ = _RT_;\r\n\r\n       where _T_ denotes what is termed the absolute temperature, or the\r\n       ordinary temperature + 273--that is, _T_ = _t_ + 273.\r\n\r\n       Starting from the supposition of the existence of an attraction\r\n       or internal pressure (expressed by _a_) proportional to the\r\n       square of the density (or inversely proportional to the square of\r\n       the volume), and of the existence of a real volume or diminished\r\n       length of path (expressed by _b_) for each gaseous molecule, van\r\n       der Waals gives for gases the following more complex equation of\r\n       condition:--\r\n\r\n              (_p_ + _a_/_v_^2)(_v_-_b_) = 1 + 0·00367_t_;\r\n\r\n       if at 0° under a pressure _p_ = 1 (for example, under the\r\n       atmospheric pressure), the volume (for instance, a litre) of\r\n       a gas or vapour he taken as 1, and therefore _v_ and _b_ be\r\n       expressed by the same units as _p_ and _a_. The deviations\r\n       from both the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac are expressed\r\n       by the above equation. Thus, for hydrogen _a_ must be taken\r\n       as infinitely small, and _b_ = 0·0009, judging by the data\r\n       for 1,000 and 2,500 metres pressure (Note 28). For other\r\n       permanent gases, for which (Note 28) I showed (about 1870) from\r\n       Regnault's and Natterer's data, a decrement of _pv_, followed\r\n       by an increment, which was confirmed (about 1880) by fresh\r\n       determinations made by Amagat, this phenomena may be expressed\r\n       in definite magnitudes of _a_ and _b_ (although van der Waals'\r\n       formula is not applicable in the case of very small pressures)\r\n       with sufficient accuracy for contemporary requirements. It\r\n       is evident that van der Waals' formula can also express the\r\n       difference of the coefficients of expansion of gases with a\r\n       change of pressure, and according to the methods of determination\r\n       (Note 26). Besides this, van der Waals' formula shows that at\r\n       temperatures above 273(8_a_/27_b_-1) only one actual volume\r\n       (gaseous) is possible, whilst at lower temperatures, by varying\r\n       the pressure, three different volumes--liquid, gaseous, and\r\n       partly liquid, partly saturated-vaporous--are possible. It is\r\n       evident that the above temperature is the absolute boiling\r\n       point--that is (_tc_) = 273(8_a_/27_b_-1). It is found under the\r\n       condition that all three possible volumes (the three roots of\r\n       van der Waals' cubic equation) are then similar and equal (_vc_\r\n       = 3_b_). The pressure in this case (_pc_) = _a_/(27_b_^2). These\r\n       ratios between the constants _a_ and _b_ and the conditions of\r\n       _critical state_--_i.e._ (_tc_) and (_pc_)--give the possibility\r\n       of determining the one magnitude from the other. Thus for ether\r\n       (Note 29), (_tc_) = 193°, (_tp_) = 40, hence _a_ = 0·0307, _b_\r\n       = 0·00533, and (_vc_) = 0·016. That mass of ether which at\r\n       a pressure of one atmosphere at 0° occupies one volume--for\r\n       instance, a litre--occupies, according to the above-mentioned\r\n       condition, this critical volume. And as the density of the vapour\r\n       of ether compared with hydrogen = 37, and a litre of hydrogen\r\n       at 0° and under the atmospheric pressure weighs 0·0896 gram,\r\n       then a litre of ether vapour weighs 3·32 grams; therefore, in a\r\n       critical state (at 193° and 40 atmospheres) 3·32 grams occupy\r\n       0·016 litre, or 16 c.c.; therefore 1 gram occupies a volume of\r\n       about 5 c.c., and the weight of 1 c.c. of ether will then be\r\n       0·21. According to the investigations of Ramsay and Young (1887),\r\n       the critical volume of ether was approximately such at about the\r\n       absolute boiling point, but the compressibility of the liquid is\r\n       so great that the slightest change of pressure or temperature\r\n       has a considerable effect on the volume. But the investigations\r\n       of the above savants gave another indirect demonstration of the\r\n       truth of van der Waals' equation. They also found for ether that\r\n       the isochords, or the lines of equal volumes (if both _t_ and\r\n       _p_ vary), are generally straight lines. Thus the volume of 10\r\n       c.c. for 1 gram of ether corresponds with pressures (expressed\r\n       in metres of mercury) equal to 0·135_t_-3·3 (for example, at\r\n       180° the pressure = 21 metres, and at 280° it = 34·5 metres).\r\n       The rectilinear form of the isochord (when _v_ = _a_ constant\r\n       quantity) is a direct result of van der Waals' formula.\r\n\r\n       When, in 1883, I demonstrated that the specific gravity of\r\n       liquids decreases in proportion to the rise of temperature\r\n       [S_{_t_} = S_{_0_}-K_t_ or S_{_t_} = S_{_0_}(1-K_t_)], or that\r\n       the volumes increase in inverse proportion to the binomial\r\n       1-K_t_, that is, V_{_t_} = V_{_0_}(1-K_t_)^{-1}, where K is the\r\n       modulus of expansion, which varies with the nature of the liquid,\r\n       then, in general, not only does a connection arise between\r\n       gases and liquids with respect to a change of volume, but also\r\n       it would appear possible, by applying van der Waals' formula,\r\n       to judge, from the phenomena of the expansion of liquids, as\r\n       to their transition into vapour, and to connect together all\r\n       the principal properties of liquids, which up to this time had\r\n       not been considered to be in direct dependence. Thus Thorpe and\r\n       Rücker found that 2(_tc_) + 273 = 1/K, where K is the modulus\r\n       of expansion in the above-mentioned formula. For example, the\r\n       expansion of ether is expressed with sufficient accuracy from\r\n       0° to 100° by the equation S_{_t_} = 0·736/(1-0·00154_t_), or\r\n       V_{_t_} = 1/(1-0·00154_t_), where 0·00154 is the modulus of\r\n       expansion, and therefore (_tc_) = 188°, or by direct observation\r\n       193°. For silicon tetrachloride, SiCl_{4}, the modulus equals\r\n       0·00136, from whence (_tc_) = 231°, and by experiment 230°. On\r\n       the other hand, D. P. Konovaloff, admitting that the external\r\n       pressure _p_ in liquids is insignificant when compared with the\r\n       internal (_a_ in van der Waals' formula), and that the work in\r\n       the expansion of liquids is proportional to their temperature\r\n       (as in gases), directly deduced, from van der Waals' formula,\r\n       the above-mentioned formula for the expansion of liquids, V_{t}\r\n       = 1/(1-K_t_), and also the magnitude of the latent heat of\r\n       evaporation, cohesion, and compressibility under pressure. In\r\n       this way van der Waals' formula embraces the gaseous, critical,\r\n       and _liquid states_ of substances, and shows the connection\r\n       between them. On this account, although van der Waals' formula\r\n       cannot be considered as perfectly general and accurate, yet it is\r\n       not only very much more exact than _pv_ = _RT_, but it is also\r\n       more comprehensive, because it applies both to gases and liquids.\r\n       Further research will naturally give a closer proximity to\r\n       truth, and will show the connection between composition and the\r\n       constants (_a_ and _b_); but a great scientific progress is seen\r\n       in this form of the equation of state.\r\n\r\n       Clausius (in 1880), taking into consideration the variability of\r\n       _a_, in van der Waals' formula, with the temperature, gave the\r\n       following equation of condition:--\r\n\r\n            (_p_ + _a_/(_T_(_v_ + _c_)^2)) (_v_-_b_) = _RT_.\r\n\r\n       Sarrau applied this formula to Amagat's data for hydrogen, and\r\n       found _a_ = 0·0551, _c_ =-0·00043, _b_ = 0·00089, and therefore\r\n       calculated its absolute boiling point as -174°, and (_pc_) = 99\r\n       atmospheres. But as similar calculations for oxygen (-105°),\r\n       nitrogen (-124°), and marsh gas (-76°) gave _tc_ higher than\r\n       it really is, the absolute boiling point of hydrogen must lie\r\n       below -174°.\r\n\r\nAlthough a substance which passes with great difficulty into a liquid\r\nstate by the action of physico-mechanical forces, hydrogen loses its\r\ngaseous state (that is, its elasticity, or the physical energy of its\r\nmolecules, or their rapid progressive motion) with comparative ease\r\nunder the influence of chemical attraction,[35] which is not only shown\r\nfrom the fact that hydrogen and oxygen (two permanent gases) form liquid\r\nwater, but also from many phenomena of the absorption of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [35] This and a number of similar cases clearly show how great are the\r\n       internal chemical forces compared with physical and mechanical\r\n       forces.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is vigorously condensed by certain solids; for example, by\r\ncharcoal and by spongy platinum. If a piece of freshly ignited charcoal\r\nbe introduced into a cylinder full of hydrogen standing in a mercury\r\nbath, then the charcoal absorbs as much as twice its volume of hydrogen.\r\nSpongy platinum condenses still more hydrogen. But _palladium_, a grey\r\nmetal which occurs with platinum, absorbs more hydrogen than any other\r\nmetal. Graham showed that when heated to a red heat and cooled in an\r\natmosphere of hydrogen, palladium retains as much as 600 volumes of\r\nhydrogen. When once absorbed it retains the hydrogen at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, and only parts with it when heated to a red heat.[36] This\r\ncapacity of certain dense metals for the absorption of hydrogen explains\r\nthe property of hydrogen of passing through metallic tubes.[37] It is\r\ntermed _occlusion_, and presents a similar phenomenon to solution; it is\r\nbased on the capacity of metals of forming unstable easily dissociating\r\ncompounds[38] with hydrogen, similar to those which salts form with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n  [36] The property of palladium of absorbing hydrogen, and of increasing\r\n       in volume in so doing, may be easily demonstrated by taking a\r\n       sheet of palladium varnished on one side, and using it as a\r\n       cathode. The hydrogen which is evolved by the action of the\r\n       current is retained by the unvarnished surface, as a consequence\r\n       of which the sheet curls up. By attaching a pointer (for\r\n       instance, a quill) to the end of the sheet this bending effect is\r\n       rendered strikingly evident, and on reversing the current (when\r\n       oxygen will be evolved and combine with the absorbed hydrogen,\r\n       forming water) it may be shown that on losing the hydrogen the\r\n       palladium regains its original form.\r\n\r\n  [37] Deville discovered that iron and platinum become pervious to\r\n       hydrogen at a red heat. He speaks of this in the following\r\n       terms:--'The permeability of such homogeneous substances as\r\n       platinum and iron is quite different from the passage of gases\r\n       through such non-compact substances as clay and graphite. The\r\n       permeability of metals depends on their expansion, brought\r\n       about by heat, and proves that metals and alloys have a certain\r\n       porosity.' However, Graham proved that it is only hydrogen which\r\n       is capable of passing through the above-named metals in this\r\n       manner. Oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia, and many other gases, only\r\n       pass through in extremely minute quantities. Graham showed that\r\n       at a red heat about 500 c.c. of hydrogen pass per minute through\r\n       a surface of one square metre of platinum 1·1 mm. thick, but that\r\n       with other gases the amount transmitted is hardly perceptible.\r\n       Indiarubber has the same capacity for allowing the transference\r\n       of hydrogen through its substance (_see_ Chapter III.), but at\r\n       the ordinary temperature one square metre, 0·014 mm. thick,\r\n       transmits only 127 c.c. of hydrogen per minute. In the experiment\r\n       on the decomposition of water by heat in porous tubes, the clay\r\n       tube may be exchanged for a platinum one with advantage. Graham\r\n       showed that by placing a platinum tube containing hydrogen under\r\n       these conditions, and surrounding it by a tube containing air,\r\n       the transference of the hydrogen may be observed by the decrease\r\n       of pressure in the platinum tube. In one hour almost all the\r\n       hydrogen (97 p.c.) had passed from the tube, without being\r\n       replaced by air. It is evident that the occlusion and passage\r\n       of hydrogen through metals capable of occluding it are not only\r\n       intimately connected together, but are dependent on the capacity\r\n       of metals to form compounds of various degrees of stability with\r\n       hydrogen--like salts with water.\r\n\r\n  [38] It appeared on further investigation that palladium gives a\r\n       definite compound, Pd_{2}H (_see_ further) with hydrogen; but\r\n       what was most instructive was the investigation of sodium\r\n       hydride, Na_{2}H, which clearly showed that the origin and\r\n       properties of such compounds are in entire accordance with the\r\n       conceptions of dissociation.\r\n\r\n       Since hydrogen is a gas which is difficult to condense, it is\r\n       little soluble in water and other liquids. At 0° a hundred\r\n       volumes of water dissolve 1·9 volume of hydrogen, and alcohol 6·9\r\n       volumes measured at 0° and 760 mm. Molten iron absorbs hydrogen,\r\n       but in solidifying, it expels it. The solution of hydrogen by\r\n       metals is to a certain degree based on its affinity for metals,\r\n       and must be likened to the solution of metals in mercury and to\r\n       the formation of alloys. In its chemical properties hydrogen,\r\n       as we shall see later, has much of a metallic character. Pictet\r\n       (_see_ Note 31) even affirms that liquid hydrogen has metallic\r\n       properties. The metallic properties of hydrogen are also evinced\r\n       in the fact that it is a good conductor of heat, which is not the\r\n       case with other gases (Magnus).\r\n\r\nAt the ordinary temperature hydrogen very feebly and rarely enters into\r\nchemical reaction. The capacity of gaseous hydrogen for reaction becomes\r\nevident only under a change of circumstances--by compression, heating,\r\nor the action of light, or at the moment of its evolution. However,\r\nunder these circumstances it _combines_ directly with only a very few of\r\nthe elements. Hydrogen combines directly with oxygen, sulphur, carbon,\r\npotassium, and certain other elements, but it does not combine directly\r\nwith either the majority of the metals or with nitrogen, phosphorus, &c.\r\nCompounds of hydrogen with certain elements on which it does not act\r\ndirectly are, however, known; they are not obtained by a direct method,\r\nbut by reactions of decomposition, or of double decomposition, of other\r\nhydrogen compounds. The property of hydrogen of combining with oxygen\r\nat a red heat determines its combustibility. We have already seen that\r\nhydrogen easily takes fire, and that it then burns with a pale--that is,\r\nnon-luminous--flame.[39] Hydrogen does not combine with the oxygen of\r\nthe atmosphere at the ordinary temperature; but this combination takes\r\nplace at a red heat,[40] and is accompanied by the evolution of much\r\nheat. The product of this combination is water--that is, a compound\r\nof oxygen and hydrogen. This is the _synthesis of water_, and we have\r\nalready noticed its analysis or decomposition into its component parts.\r\nThe synthesis of water may be very easily observed if a cold glass bell\r\njar be placed over a burning hydrogen flame, and, better still, if the\r\nhydrogen flame be lighted in the tube of a condenser. The water will\r\ncondense in drops as it is formed on the walls of the condenser and\r\ntrickle down.[41]\r\n\r\n  [39] If it be desired to obtain a perfectly colourless hydrogen\r\n       flame, it must issue from a platinum nozzle, as the glass end of\r\n       a gas-conducting tube imparts a yellow tint to the flame, owing\r\n       to the presence of sodium in the glass.\r\n\r\n  [40] Let us imagine that a stream of hydrogen passes along a tube, and\r\n       let us mentally divide this stream into several parts,\r\n       consecutively passing out from the orifice of the tube. The first\r\n       part is lighted--that is, brought to a state of incandescence,\r\n       in which state it combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere. A\r\n       considerable amount of heat is evolved in the combination. The\r\n       heat evolved then, so to say, ignites the second part of hydrogen\r\n       coming from the tube, and, therefore, when once ignited, the\r\n       hydrogen continues to burn, if there be a continual supply of it,\r\n       and if the atmosphere in which it burns be unlimited and contains\r\n       oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [41] The combustibility of hydrogen may be shown by the direct\r\n       decomposition of water by sodium. If a pellet of sodium be thrown\r\n       into a vessel containing water, it floats on the water and\r\n       evolves hydrogen, which may be lighted. The presence of sodium\r\n       imparts a yellow tint to the flame. If potassium be taken, the\r\n       hydrogen bursts into flame spontaneously, because sufficient heat\r\n       is evolved in the reaction to ignite the hydrogen. The flame is\r\n       coloured violet by the potassium. If sodium be thrown not on\r\n       to water, but on to an acid, it will evolve more heat, and the\r\n       hydrogen will then also burst into flame. These experiments must\r\n       be carried on with caution, as, sometimes towards the end, a\r\n       mass of sodium oxide (Note 8) is produced, and flies about; it\r\n       is therefore best to cover the vessel in which the experiment is\r\n       carried on.\r\n\r\nLight does not aid the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, so that a\r\nmixture of these two gases does not change when exposed to the action\r\nof light; but an electric spark acts just like a flame, and this is\r\ntaken advantage of for inflaming a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, or\r\ndetonating gas, inside a vessel, as will be explained in the following\r\nchapters. As hydrogen (and oxygen also) is condensed by spongy platinum,\r\nby which a rise of temperature ensues, and as platinum acts by contact\r\n(Introduction), therefore hydrogen also combines with oxygen, under\r\nthe influence of platinum, as Döbereiner showed. If spongy platinum be\r\nthrown into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, an explosion takes place.\r\nIf a mixture of the gases be passed over spongy platinum, combination\r\nalso ensues, and the platinum becomes red-hot.[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] This property of spongy platinum is made use of in the so-called\r\n       hydrogen cigar-lighter. It consists of a glass cylinder or\r\n       beaker, inside which there is a small lead stand (which is not\r\n       acted on by sulphuric acid), on which a piece of zinc is laid.\r\n       This zinc is covered by a bell, which is open at the bottom\r\n       and furnished with a cock at the top. Sulphuric acid is poured\r\n       into the space between the bell and the sides of the outer\r\n       glass cylinder, and will thus compress the gas in the bell. If\r\n       the cock of the cylinder be opened the gas will escape by it,\r\n       and will be replaced by the acid, which, coming into contact\r\n       with the zinc, evolves hydrogen, and it will escape through the\r\n       cock. If the cock be closed, then the hydrogen evolved will\r\n       increase the pressure of the gas in the bell, and thus again\r\n       force the acid into the space between the bell and the walls of\r\n       the outer cylinder. Thus the action of the acid on the zinc may\r\n       be stopped or started at will by opening or shutting the cock,\r\n       and consequently a stream of hydrogen may be always turned on.\r\n       Now, if a piece of spongy platinum be placed in this stream, the\r\n       hydrogen will take light, because the spongy platinum becomes\r\n       hot in condensing the hydrogen and inflames it. The considerable\r\n       rise in temperature of the platinum depends, among other things,\r\n       on the fact that the hydrogen condensed in its pores comes into\r\n       contact with previously absorbed and condensed atmospheric\r\n       oxygen, with which hydrogen combines with great facility in this\r\n       form. In this manner the hydrogen cigar-lighter gives a stream of\r\n       burning hydrogen when the cock is open. In order that it should\r\n       work regularly it is necessary that the spongy platinum should be\r\n       quite clean, and it is best enveloped in a thin sheet of platinum\r\n       foil, which protects it from dust. In any case, after some time\r\n       it will be necessary to clean the platinum, which may be easily\r\n       done by boiling it in nitric acid, which does not dissolve the\r\n       platinum, but clears it of all dirt. This imperfection has given\r\n       rise to several other forms, in which an electric spark is made\r\n       to pass before the orifice from which the hydrogen escapes. This\r\n       is arranged in such a manner that the zinc of a galvanic element\r\n       is immersed when the cock is turned, or a small coil giving a\r\n       spark is put into circuit on turning the hydrogen on.\r\n\r\nAlthough gaseous hydrogen does not act directly[43] on many substances,\r\nyet in a _nascent state_ reaction often takes place. Thus, for\r\ninstance, water on which sodium amalgam is acting contains hydrogen in\r\na nascent state. The hydrogen is here evolved from a liquid, and at\r\nthe first moment of its formation must be in a condensed state.[44]\r\nIn this condition it is capable of reacting on substances on which it\r\ndoes not act in a gaseous state.[44 bis] Reactions of substitution or\r\ndisplacement of metals by hydrogen at the moment of its formation are\r\nparticularly numerous.[45]\r\n\r\n  [43] Under conditions similar to those in which hydrogen combines\r\n       with oxygen it is also capable of combining with chlorine. A\r\n       mixture of hydrogen and chlorine explodes on the passage of an\r\n       electric spark through it, or on contact with an incandescent\r\n       substance, and also in the presence of spongy platinum; but,\r\n       besides this, the action of light alone is enough to bring about\r\n       the combination of hydrogen and chlorine. If a mixture of equal\r\n       volumes of hydrogen and chlorine be exposed to the action of\r\n       sunlight, complete combination rapidly ensues, accompanied by a\r\n       report. Hydrogen does not combine directly with carbon, either at\r\n       the ordinary temperature or by the action of heat and pressure.\r\n       But if an electric current be passed through carbon electrodes\r\n       at a short distance from each other (as in the electric light\r\n       or voltaic arc), so as to form an electric arc in which the\r\n       particles of carbon are carried from one pole to the other, then,\r\n       in the intense heat to which the carbon is subjected in this\r\n       case, it is capable of combining with hydrogen. A gas of peculiar\r\n       smell called acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, is thus formed from carbon\r\n       and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [44] There is another explanation of the facility with which hydrogen\r\n       reacts in a nascent state. We shall afterwards learn that the\r\n       molecule of hydrogen contains two atoms, H_{2}, but there are\r\n       elements the molecules of which only contain one atom--for\r\n       instance, mercury. Therefore, every reaction of gaseous hydrogen\r\n       must be accompanied by the disruption of that bond which exists\r\n       between the atoms forming a molecule. At the moment of evolution,\r\n       however, it is supposed that free atoms exist, and in this\r\n       condition, according to the hypothesis, act energetically. This\r\n       hypothesis is not based upon facts, and the idea that hydrogen is\r\n       condensed at the moment of its evolution is more natural, and is\r\n       in accordance with the fact (Note 12) that compressed hydrogen\r\n       displaces palladium and silver (Brunner, Beketoff)--that is, acts\r\n       as at the moment of its liberation.\r\n\r\n  [44 bis] There is a very intimate and evident relation between the\r\n       phenomena which take place in the action of spongy platinum and\r\n       the phenomena of the action in a nascent state. The combination\r\n       of hydrogen with aldehyde may be taken as an example. Aldehyde is\r\n       a volatile liquid with an aromatic smell, boiling at 21°, soluble\r\n       in water, and absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere, and in this\r\n       absorption forming acetic acid--the substance which is found in\r\n       ordinary vinegar. If sodium amalgam be thrown into an aqueous\r\n       solution of aldehyde, the greater part of the hydrogen evolved\r\n       combines with the aldehyde, forming alcohol--a substance also\r\n       soluble in water, which forms the principle of all spirituous\r\n       liquors, boils at 78°, and contains the same amount of oxygen\r\n       and carbon as aldehyde, but more hydrogen. The composition of\r\n       aldehyde is C_{2}H_{4}O, that of alcohol C_{2}H_{6}O.\r\n\r\n  [45] When, for instance, an acid and zinc are added to a salt of\r\n       silver, the silver is reduced; but this may be explained as a\r\n       reaction of the zinc, and not of the hydrogen at the moment\r\n       of its formation. There are, however, examples to which this\r\n       explanation is entirely inapplicable; thus, for instance,\r\n       hydrogen, at the moment of its liberation easily takes up oxygen\r\n       from its compounds with nitrogen if they be in solution, and\r\n       converts the nitrogen into its hydrogen-compound. Here the\r\n       nitrogen and hydrogen, so to speak, meet at the moment of their\r\n       liberation, and in this state combine together.\r\n\r\n       It is evident from this that the elastic gaseous state of\r\n       hydrogen fixes the limit of its energy: prevents it from entering\r\n       into those combinations of which it is capable. In the nascent\r\n       state we have hydrogen which is not in a gaseous state, and its\r\n       action is then much more energetic. At the moment of evolution\r\n       that heat, which would be latent in the gaseous hydrogen, is\r\n       transmitted to its molecules, and consequently they are in a\r\n       state of strain, and can hence act on many substances.\r\n\r\nMetals, as we shall afterwards see, are in many cases able to replace\r\neach other; they also, and in some cases still more easily, replace and\r\nare replaced by hydrogen. We have already seen examples of this in the\r\nformation of hydrogen from water, sulphuric acid, &c. In all these\r\ncases the metals sodium, iron, or zinc displace the hydrogen which\r\noccurs in these compounds. Hydrogen may be displaced from many of its\r\ncompounds by metals in exactly the same manner as it is displaced from\r\nwater; so, for example, hydrochloric acid, which is formed directly\r\nby the combination of hydrogen with chlorine, gives hydrogen by the\r\naction of a great many metals, just as sulphuric acid does. Potassium\r\nand sodium also displace hydrogen from its compounds with nitrogen; it\r\nis only from its compounds with carbon that hydrogen is not displaced\r\nby metals. Hydrogen, in its turn, is able to replace metals; this is\r\naccomplished most easily on heating, and with those metals which do not\r\nthemselves displace hydrogen. If hydrogen be passed over the compounds\r\nof many metals with oxygen at a red heat, it takes up the oxygen from\r\nthe metals and displaces them just as it is itself displaced by metals.\r\nIf hydrogen be passed over the compound of oxygen with copper at a\r\nred heat, then metallic copper and water are obtained--CuO + H_{2} =\r\nH_{2}O + Cu. This kind of double decomposition is called _reduction_\r\nwith respect to the metal, which is thus reduced to a metallic state\r\nfrom its combination with oxygen. But it must be recollected that all\r\nmetals do not displace hydrogen from its compound with oxygen, and,\r\nconversely, hydrogen is not able to displace all metals from their\r\ncompounds with oxygen; thus it does not displace potassium, calcium, or\r\naluminium from its compounds with oxygen. If the metals be arranged in\r\nthe following series: K, Na, Ca, Al ... Fe, Zn, Hg ... Cu, Pb, Ag, Au,\r\nthen the first are able to take up oxygen from water--that is, displace\r\nhydrogen--whilst the last do not act thus, but are, on the contrary,\r\nreduced by hydrogen--that is, have, as is said, a less affinity for\r\noxygen than hydrogen, whilst potassium, sodium, and calcium have more.\r\nThis is also expressed by the amount of heat evolved in the act of\r\ncombination with oxygen (_see_ Note 7), and is shown by the fact that\r\npotassium and sodium and other similar metals evolve heat in decomposing\r\nwater; but copper, silver, and the like do not do this, because in\r\ncombining with oxygen they evolve less heat than hydrogen does, and\r\ntherefore it happens that when hydrogen reduces these metals heat is\r\nevolved. Thus, for example, if 16 grams of oxygen combine with copper,\r\n38,000 units of heat are evolved; and when 16 grams of oxygen combine\r\nwith hydrogen, forming water, 69,000 units of heat are evolved; whilst\r\n23 grams of sodium, in combining with 16 grams of oxygen, evolve 100,000\r\nunits of heat. This example clearly shows that chemical reactions which\r\nproceed directly and unaided evolve heat. Sodium decomposes water and\r\nhydrogen reduces copper, because they are _exothermal_ reactions, or\r\nthose which evolve heat; copper does not decompose water, because such\r\na reaction would be accompanied by an absorption (or secretion) of heat,\r\nor belongs to the class of _endothermal_ reactions in which heat is\r\nabsorbed; and such reactions do not generally proceed directly, although\r\nthey may take place with the aid of energy (electrical, thermal, &c.)\r\nborrowed from some foreign source.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Several numerical data and reflections bearing on this matter are\r\n       enumerated in Notes 7, 9, and 11. It must be observed that the\r\n       action of iron or zinc on water is reversible. But the reaction\r\n       CuO + H_{2} = Cu + H_{2}O is not reversible; the difference\r\n       between the degrees of affinity is very great in this case,\r\n       and, therefore, so far as is at present known, no hydrogen is\r\n       liberated even in the presence of a large excess of water. It\r\n       is to be further remarked, that under the conditions of the\r\n       dissociation of water, copper is not oxidised by water, because\r\n       the oxide of copper is reduced by free hydrogen. If a definite\r\n       amount of a metal and acid be taken and their reaction be carried\r\n       on in a closed space, then the evolution of hydrogen will cease,\r\n       when its tension equals that at which compressed hydrogen\r\n       displaces the metal. The result depends upon the nature of the\r\n       metal and the strength of the solution of acid. Tammann and\r\n       Nernst (1892) found that the metals stand in the following order\r\n       in respect to this limiting tension of hydrogen:--Na, Mg, Zn, Al,\r\n       Cd, Fe, Ni.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Apparatus employed by Dumas for determining the\r\ncomposition of water. Described in text.]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of metals by hydrogen is taken advantage of for\r\n_determining the exact composition of water by weight_. Copper oxide is\r\nusually chosen for this purpose. It is heated to redness in hydrogen,\r\nand the quantity of water thus formed is determined, when the quantity\r\nof oxygen which occurs in it is found from the loss of weight of the\r\ncopper oxide. The copper oxide must be weighed immediately before and\r\nafter the experiment. The difference shows the weight of the oxygen\r\nwhich entered into the composition of the water formed. In this manner\r\nonly solids have to be weighed, which is a very great gain in the\r\naccuracy of the results obtained.[47] Dulong and Berzelius (1819) were\r\nthe first to determine the composition of water by this method, and\r\nthey found that water contains 88·91 of oxygen and 11·09 of hydrogen in\r\n100 parts by weight, or 8·008 parts of oxygen per one part of hydrogen.\r\nDumas (1842) improved on this method,[48] and found that water contains\r\n12·575 parts of hydrogen per 100 parts of oxygen--that is, 7·990 parts\r\nof oxygen per 1 part of hydrogen--and therefore it is usually accepted\r\nthat _water contains eight parts by weight of oxygen to_ one _part by\r\nweight of hydrogen_. By whatever method water be obtained, it will\r\nalways present the same composition. Whether it be taken from nature\r\nand purified, or whether it be obtained from hydrogen by oxidation,\r\nor whether it be separated from any of its compounds, or obtained by\r\nsome double decomposition--it will in every case contain one part by\r\nweight of hydrogen and eight parts of oxygen. This is because water\r\nis a definite chemical compound. Detonating gas, from which it may be\r\nformed, is a simple mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, although a mixture\r\nof the same composition as water. All the properties of both constituent\r\ngases are preserved in detonating gas. Either one or the other gas may\r\nbe added to it without destroying its homogeneity. The fundamental\r\nproperties of oxygen and hydrogen are not found in water, and neither\r\nof the gases can be directly combined with it. But they may be evolved\r\nfrom it. In the formation of water there is an evolution of heat; for\r\nthe decomposition of water heat is required. All this is expressed by\r\nthe words, _Water is a definite chemical compound of hydrogen with\r\noxygen_. Taking the symbol of hydrogen, H, as expressing a unit quantity\r\nby weight of this substance, and expressing 16 parts by weight of oxygen\r\nby O, we can formulate all the above statements by the chemical symbol\r\nof water, H_{2}O. As only definite chemical compounds are denoted\r\nby formulæ, having denoted the formula of a compound substance we\r\nexpress by it the entire series of properties which go to make up our\r\nconception of a definite compound, and at the same time the quantitative\r\ncomposition of the substance by weight. Further, as we shall afterwards\r\nsee, formulæ express the volume of the gases contained in a substance.\r\nThus the formula of water shows that it contains two volumes of hydrogen\r\nand one volume of oxygen. Besides which, we shall learn that the formula\r\nexpresses the density of the vapour of a compound, and on this many\r\nproperties of substances depend, and, as we shall learn, determine the\r\nquantities of the bodies entering into reactions. This vapour density we\r\nshall find also determines the quantity of a substance entering into a\r\nreaction. Thus the letters H_{2}O tell the chemist the entire history of\r\nthe substance. This is an international language, which endows chemistry\r\nwith a simplicity, clearness, stability, and trustworthiness founded on\r\nthe investigation of the laws of nature.\r\n\r\n  [47] This determination may be carried on in an apparatus like that\r\n       mentioned in Note 13 of Chapter I.\r\n\r\n  [48] We will proceed to describe Dumas' method and results. For this\r\n       determination pure and dry copper oxide is necessary. Dumas took\r\n       a sufficient quantity of copper oxide for the formation of 50\r\n       grams of water in each determination. As the oxide of copper\r\n       was weighed before and after the experiment, and as the amount\r\n       of oxygen contained in water was determined by the difference\r\n       between these weights, it was essential that no other substance\r\n       besides the oxygen forming the water should be evolved from\r\n       the oxide of copper during its ignition in hydrogen. It was\r\n       necessary, also, that the hydrogen should be perfectly pure,\r\n       and free not only from traces of moisture, but from any other\r\n       impurities which might dissolve in the water or combine with the\r\n       copper and form some other compound with it. The bulb containing\r\n       the oxide of copper (fig. 26), which was heated to redness,\r\n       should be quite free from air, as otherwise the oxygen in the\r\n       air might, in combining with the hydrogen passing through the\r\n       vessel, form water in addition to that formed by the oxygen\r\n       of the oxide of copper. The water formed should be entirely\r\n       absorbed in order to accurately determine its quantity. The\r\n       hydrogen was evolved in the three-necked bottle. The sulphuric\r\n       acid, for acting on the zinc, is poured through funnels into\r\n       the middle neck. The hydrogen evolved in the Woulfe's bottle\r\n       passes through [U] tubes, in which it is purified, to the bulb,\r\n       where it comes into contact with the copper oxide, forms water,\r\n       and reduces the oxide to metallic copper; the water formed is\r\n       condensed in the second bulb, and any passing off is absorbed in\r\n       the second set of [U] tubes. This is the general arrangement of\r\n       the apparatus. The bulb with the copper oxide is weighed before\r\n       and after the experiment. The loss in weight shows the quantity\r\n       of oxygen which entered into the composition of the water formed,\r\n       the weight of the latter being shown by the gain in weight of\r\n       the absorbing apparatus. Knowing the amount of oxygen in the\r\n       water formed, we also know the quantity of hydrogen contained in\r\n       it, and consequently we determine the composition of water by\r\n       weight. This is the essence of the determination. We will now\r\n       turn to certain particulars. In one neck of the three-necked\r\n       bottle a tube is placed dipping under mercury. This serves as\r\n       a safety-valve to prevent the pressure inside the apparatus\r\n       becoming too great from the rapid evolution of hydrogen. If the\r\n       pressure rose to any considerable extent, the current of gases\r\n       and vapours would be very rapid, and, as a consequence, the\r\n       hydrogen would not be perfectly purified, or the water entirely\r\n       absorbed in the tubes placed for this purpose. In the third neck\r\n       of the Woulfe's bottle is a tube conducting the hydrogen to the\r\n       purifying apparatus, consisting of eight [U] tubes, destined\r\n       for the purification and testing of the hydrogen. The hydrogen,\r\n       evolved by zinc and sulphuric acid, is purified by passing it\r\n       first through a tube full of pieces of glass moistened with a\r\n       solution of lead nitrate next through silver sulphate; the lead\r\n       nitrate retains sulphurette hydrogen, and arseniuretted hydrogen\r\n       is retained by the tube with silver sulphate. Caustic potash in\r\n       the next [U] tube retains any acid which might come over. The\r\n       two following tubes are filled with lumps of dry caustic potash\r\n       in order to absorb any carbonic anhydride and moisture which the\r\n       hydrogen might contain. The next two tubes, to remove the last\r\n       traces of moisture, are filled with phosphoric anhydride, mixed\r\n       with lumps of pumice-stone. They are immersed in a freezing\r\n       mixture. The small [U] tube contains hygroscopic substances,\r\n       and is weighed before the experiment: this is in order to know\r\n       whether the hydrogen passing through still retains any moisture.\r\n       If it does not, then the weight of this tube will not vary during\r\n       the whole experiment, but if the hydrogen evolved still retains\r\n       moisture, the tube will increase in weight. The copper oxide is\r\n       placed in the bulb, which, previous to the experiment, is dried\r\n       with the copper oxide for a long period of time. The air is then\r\n       exhausted from it, in order to weigh the oxide of copper in a\r\n       vacuum and to avoid the need of a correction for weighing in\r\n       air. The bulb is made of infusible glass, that it may be able to\r\n       withstand a lengthy (20 hours) exposure to a red heat without\r\n       changing in form. The weighed bulb is only connected with the\r\n       purifying apparatus after the hydrogen has passed through for\r\n       a long time, and after experiment has shown that the hydrogen\r\n       passing from the purifying apparatus is pure and does not\r\n       contain any air. On passing from the condensing bulb the gas and\r\n       vapour enter into an apparatus for absorbing the last traces of\r\n       moisture. The first [U] tube contains pieces of ignited potash,\r\n       the second and third tubes phosphoric anhydride or pumice-stone\r\n       moistened with sulphuric acid. The last of the two is employed\r\n       for determining whether all the moisture is absorbed, and is\r\n       therefore weighed separately. The final tube only serves as a\r\n       safety-tube for the whole apparatus, in order that the external\r\n       moisture should not penetrate into it. The glass cylinder\r\n       contains sulphuric acid, through which the excess of hydrogen\r\n       passes; it enables the rate at which the hydrogen is evolved\r\n       to be judged, and whether its amount should be decreased or\r\n       increased.\r\n\r\n       When the apparatus is fitted up it must be seen that all its\r\n       parts are hermetically tight before commencing the experiment.\r\n       When the previously weighed parts are connected together and the\r\n       whole apparatus put into communication, then the bulb containing\r\n       the copper oxide is heated with a spirit lamp (reduction does\r\n       not take place without the aid of heat), and the reduction of\r\n       the copper oxide then takes place, and water is formed. When\r\n       nearly all the copper oxide is reduced the lamp is removed and\r\n       the apparatus allowed to cool, the current of hydrogen being\r\n       kept up all the time. When cool, the drawn-out end of the bulb\r\n       is fused up, and the hydrogen remaining in it is exhausted, in\r\n       order that the copper may be again weighed in a vacuum. The\r\n       absorbing apparatus remains full of hydrogen, and would therefore\r\n       present a less weight than if it were full of air, as it was\r\n       before the experiment, and for this reason, having disconnected\r\n       the copper oxide bulb, a current of dry air is passed through it\r\n       until the gas passing from the glass cylinder is quite free from\r\n       hydrogen. The condensing bulb and the two tubes next to it are\r\n       then weighed, in order to determine the quantity of water formed.\r\n       Dumas repeated this experiment many times. The average result was\r\n       that water contains 1253·3 parts of hydrogen per 10,000 parts\r\n       of oxygen. Making a correction for the amount of air contained\r\n       in the sulphuric acid employed for producing the hydrogen,\r\n       Dumas obtained the average figure 1251·5, between the extremes\r\n       1247·2 and 1256·2. This proves that per 1 part of hydrogen water\r\n       contains 7·9904 parts of oxygen, with a possible error of not\r\n       more than 1/250, or 0·03, in the amount of oxygen per 1 part of\r\n       hydrogen.\r\n\r\n       Erdmann and Marchand, in eight determinations, found that per\r\n       10,000 parts of oxygen water contains an average of 1,252 parts\r\n       of hydrogen, with a difference of from 1,258·5 to 1,248·7; hence\r\n       per 1 part of hydrogen there would be 7·9952 of oxygen, with an\r\n       error of at least 0·05.\r\n\r\n       Keiser (1888), in America by employing palladium hydride, and\r\n       by introducing various fresh precautions for obtaining accurate\r\n       results, found the composition of water to be 15·95 parts of\r\n       oxygen per 2 of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n       Certain of the latest determinations of the composition of\r\n       water, as also those made by Dumas, always give less than 8, and\r\n       on the average 7·98, of oxygen per 1 part of hydrogen. However,\r\n       not one of these figures is to be entirely depended on, and for\r\n       ordinary accuracy it may be considered that O = 16 when H = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n         OXYGEN AND THE CHIEF ASPECTS OF ITS SALINE COMBINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the earth's surface there is no other element which is so widely\r\ndistributed as oxygen in its various compounds.[1] It makes up\r\neight-ninths of the weight of water, which occupies the greater part\r\nof the earth's surface. Nearly all earthy substances and rocks consist\r\nof compounds of oxygen with metals and other elements. Thus, the\r\ngreater part of sand is formed of silica, SiO_{2}, which contains 53\r\np.c. of oxygen; clay contains water, alumina (formed of aluminium and\r\noxygen), and silica. It may be considered that earthy substances and\r\nrocks contain up to one-third of their weight of oxygen; animal and\r\nvegetable substances are also very rich in oxygen. Without counting\r\nthe water present in them, plants contain up to 40, and animals up to\r\n20 p.c. by weight of oxygen. Thus, oxygen compounds predominate on the\r\nearth's surface. Besides this, a portion exists in a free state, and is\r\ncontained in admixture with nitrogen in the atmosphere, forming about\r\none-fourth of its mass, or one-fifth of its volume.\r\n\r\n  [1] As regards the interior of the earth, it probably contains far less\r\n      oxygen compounds than the surface, judging by the accumulated\r\n      evidences of the earth's origin, of meteorites, of the earth's\r\n      density, &c. (_see_ Chapter VIII., Note 58, and Chapter XXII.,\r\n      Note 2).\r\n\r\nBeing so widely distributed in nature, oxygen plays a very important\r\npart in it, for a number of the phenomena which take place before us\r\nare mainly dependent on it. _Animals breathe_ air in order to obtain\r\nonly _oxygen_ from it, the oxygen entering into their respiratory organs\r\n(the lungs of human beings and animals, the gills of fishes, and the\r\ntrachæ of insects); they, so to say, drink in air in order to absorb the\r\noxygen. The oxygen of the air (or dissolved in water) passes through the\r\nmembranes of the respiratory organs into the blood, is retained in it by\r\nthe blood corpuscles, is transmitted by their means to all parts of the\r\nbody, aids their transformations, bringing about chemical processes in\r\nthem, and chiefly extracting carbon from them in the form of carbonic\r\nanhydride, the greater part of which passes into the blood, is dissolved\r\nby it, and is thrown off by the lungs during the absorption of the\r\noxygen. Thus, in the process of respiration carbonic anhydride (and\r\nwater) is given off, and the oxygen of the air absorbed, by which means\r\nthe blood is changed from a red venous to a dark-red arterial blood. The\r\ncessation of this process causes death, because then all those chemical\r\nprocesses, and the consequent heat and work which the oxygen introduced\r\ninto the system brought about, cease. For this reason suffocation and\r\ndeath ensue in a vacuum, or in a gas which does not contain free oxygen,\r\n_i.e._ which does not support combustion. If an animal be placed in an\r\natmosphere of free oxygen, at first its movements are very active and a\r\ngeneral invigoration is remarked, but a reaction soon sets in, and death\r\nmay ensue. The oxygen of the air when it enters the lungs is diluted\r\nwith four volumes of nitrogen, which is not absorbed into the system,\r\nso that the blood absorbs but a small quantity of oxygen from the air,\r\nwhilst in an atmosphere of pure oxygen a large quantity of oxygen\r\nwould be absorbed, and would produce a very rapid change of all parts\r\nof the organism, and destroy it. From what has been said, it will be\r\nunderstood that oxygen may be employed in respiration, at any rate for a\r\nlimited time, when the respiratory organs suffer under certain forms of\r\nsuffocation and impediment to breathing.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] It is evident that the partial pressure (_see_ Chapter I.) acts in\r\n      respiration. The researches of Paul Bert showed this with\r\n      particular clearness. Under a pressure of one-fifth of an\r\n      atmosphere consisting of oxygen only, animals and human beings\r\n      remain under the ordinary conditions of the partial pressure\r\n      of oxygen, but organisms cannot support air rarefied to\r\n      one-fifth, for then the partial pressure of the oxygen falls\r\n      to one-twenty-fifth of an atmosphere. Even under a pressure of\r\n      one-third of an atmosphere the regular life of human beings\r\n      is impossible, by reason of the impossibility of respiration\r\n      (because of the decrease of solubility of oxygen in the blood),\r\n      owing to the small partial pressure of the oxygen, and not from\r\n      any mechanical effect of the decrease of pressure. Paul Bert\r\n      illustrated all this by many experiments, some of which he\r\n      conducted on himself. This explains, among other things, the\r\n      discomfort felt in the ascent of high mountains or in balloons\r\n      when the height reached exceeds eight kilometres, and at pressures\r\n      below 250 mm. (Chapter II., Note 23). It is evident that an\r\n      artificial atmosphere has to be employed in the ascent to great\r\n      heights, just as in submarine work. The cure by compressed and\r\n      rarefied air which is practised in certain illnesses is based\r\n      partly on the mechanical action of the change of pressure, and\r\n      partly on the alteration in the partial pressure of the respired\r\n      oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe combustion of organic substances--that is, substances which make\r\nup the composition of plants and animals--proceeds in the same manner\r\nas the combustion of many inorganic substances, such as sulphur,\r\nphosphorus, iron, &c., from the combination of these substances with\r\noxygen, as was described in the Introduction. The decomposition,\r\nrotting, and similar transformations of substances, which proceed\r\naround us, are also very often dependent on the action of the oxygen\r\nof the air, and also reduce it from a free to a combined state. The\r\nmajority of the compounds of oxygen are, like water, very stable, and\r\ndo not give up their oxygen under the ordinary conditions of nature. As\r\nthese processes are taking place everywhere, it might be expected that\r\nthe amount of free oxygen in the atmosphere should decrease, and this\r\ndecrease should proceed somewhat rapidly. This is, in fact, observed\r\nwhere combustion or respiration proceeds in a closed space. Animals\r\nsuffocate in a closed space because in consuming the oxygen the air\r\nremains unfit for respiration. In the same manner combustion, after a\r\ntime, ceases in a closed space, which may be proved by a very simple\r\nexperiment. An ignited substance--for instance, a piece of burning\r\nsulphur--has only to be placed in a glass flask, which is then closed\r\nwith a stout cork to prevent the access of the external air; combustion\r\nwill proceed for a certain time, so long as the flask contains any\r\nfree oxygen, but it will cease when the oxygen of the enclosed air has\r\ncombined with the sulphur. From what has been said, it is evident that\r\nregularity of combustion or respiration requires a constant renewal of\r\nair--that is, that the burning substance or respiring animal should\r\nhave access to a fresh supply of oxygen. This is attained in dwellings\r\nby having many windows, outlets, and ventilators, and by the current of\r\nair produced by fires and stoves. As regards the air over the entire\r\nearth's surface its amount of oxygen hardly decreases, because in nature\r\nthere is a process going on which renews the supply of free oxygen.\r\n_Plants_, or rather their leaves, during daytime,[3] under the influence\r\nof light, absorb carbonic anhydride CO_{2}, and _evolve free oxygen_.\r\nThus the loss of oxygen which occurs in consequence of the respiration\r\nof animals and of combustion is made good by plants. If a leaf be placed\r\nin a bell jar containing water, and carbonic anhydride (because this\r\ngas is absorbed and oxygen evolved from it by plants) be passed into\r\nthe bell, and the whole apparatus placed in sunlight, then oxygen will\r\naccumulate in the bell jar. This experiment was first made by Priestley\r\nat the end of the last century. Thus the life of plants on the earth not\r\nonly serves for the formation of food for animals, but also for keeping\r\nup a constant percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. In the long period\r\nof the life of the earth an equilibrium has been attained between the\r\nprocesses absorbing and evolving oxygen, by which a definite quantity of\r\nfree oxygen is preserved in the entire mass of the atmosphere.[4]\r\n\r\n  [3] At night, without the action of light, without the absorption\r\n      of that energy which is required for the decomposition of carbonic\r\n      anhydride into free oxygen and carbon (which is retained by the\r\n      plants) they breathe like animals, absorbing oxygen and evolving\r\n      carbonic anhydride. This process also goes on side by side with\r\n      the reverse process in the daytime, but it is then far feebler\r\n      than that which gives oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [4] The earth's surface is equal to about 510 million square\r\n      kilometres, and the mass of the air (at a pressure of 760 mm.)\r\n      on each kilometre of surface is about 10-1/3 thousand millions\r\n      of kilograms, or about 10-1/3 million tons; therefore the whole\r\n      weight of the atmosphere is about 5,100 million million (= 51 ×\r\n      10^{14}) tons. Consequently there are about 2 × 10^{15} tons of\r\n      free oxygen in the earth's atmosphere. The innumerable series of\r\n      processes which absorb a portion of this oxygen are compensated\r\n      for by the plant processes. Assuming that 100 million tons of\r\n      vegetable matter, containing 40 p.c. of carbon, formed from\r\n      carbonic acid, are produced (and the same process proceeds in\r\n      water) per year on the 100 million square kilometres of dry land\r\n      (ten tons of roots, leaves, stems, &c., per hectare, or 1/100 of\r\n      a square kilometre), we find that the plant life of the dry land\r\n      gives about 100,000 tons of oxygen, which is an insignificant\r\n      fraction of the entire mass of the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nOxygen was obtained as an independent gas in 1774 by Priestley in\r\nEngland and in the same year by Scheele in Sweden, but its nature and\r\ngreat importance were only perfectly elucidated by Lavoisier.\r\n\r\nFree oxygen may be obtained by one or other method from all the\r\nsubstances in which it occurs. Thus, for instance, the oxygen of many\r\nsubstances may be transferred into water, from which, as we have already\r\nseen, oxygen may be obtained.[5] We will first consider the methods of\r\nextracting oxygen from air as being a substance everywhere distributed.\r\nThe separation of oxygen from it is, however, hampered by many\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n  [5] The extraction of oxygen from water may be effected by two\r\n      processes: either by the decomposition of water into its\r\n      constituent parts by the action of a galvanic current (Chapter\r\n      II.), or by means of the removal of the hydrogen from water.\r\n      But, as we have seen and already know, hydrogen enters into\r\n      direct combination with very few substances, and then only under\r\n      special circumstances; whilst oxygen, as we shall soon learn,\r\n      combines with nearly all substances. Only gaseous chlorine (and,\r\n      especially, fluorine) is capable of decomposing water, taking up\r\n      the hydrogen from it, without combining with the oxygen. Chlorine\r\n      is soluble in water, and if an aqueous solution of chlorine,\r\n      so-called chlorine water, be poured into a flask, and this flask\r\n      be inverted in a basin containing the same chlorine water, then we\r\n      shall have an apparatus by means of which oxygen may be extracted\r\n      from water. At the ordinary temperature, and in the dark, chlorine\r\n      does not act on water, or only acts very feebly; but under the\r\n      action of direct sunlight chlorine decomposes water, with the\r\n      evolution of oxygen. The chlorine then combines with the hydrogen,\r\n      and gives hydrochloric acid, which dissolves in the water, and\r\n      therefore free oxygen only will be separated from the liquid, and\r\n      it will only contain a small quantity of chlorine in admixture,\r\n      which can be easily removed by passing the gas through a solution\r\n      of caustic potash.\r\n\r\nFrom air, which contains a _mixture_ of oxygen and nitrogen, the\r\nnitrogen alone cannot be removed, because it has no inclination to\r\ncombine directly or readily with any substance; and although it does\r\ncombine with certain substances (boron, titanium), these substances\r\ncombine simultaneously with the oxygen of the atmosphere.[6] However,\r\noxygen may be separated from air by causing it to combine with\r\nsubstances which may be easily decomposed by the action of heat,\r\nand, in so doing, give up the oxygen absorbed--that is, by making\r\nuse of reversible reactions. Thus, for instance, the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere may be made to oxidise sulphurous anhydride, SO_{2} (by\r\npassing directly over ignited spongy platinum), and to form sulphuric\r\nanhydride, or sulphur trioxide, SO_{3}; and this substance (which is a\r\nsolid and volatile, and therefore easily separated from the nitrogen and\r\nsulphurous anhydride), on further heating, gives oxygen and sulphurous\r\nanhydride. Caustic soda or lime extracts (absorbs) the sulphurous\r\nanhydride from this mixture, whilst the oxygen is not absorbed, and thus\r\nit is isolated from the air. On a large scale in works, as we shall\r\nafterwards see, sulphurous anhydride is transformed into hydrate of\r\nsulphuric trioxide, or sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}; if this is allowed\r\nto drop on to red-hot flagstones, water, sulphurous anhydride, and\r\noxygen are obtained. The oxygen is easily isolated from this mixture\r\nby passing the gases over lime. The extraction of oxygen from oxide\r\nof mercury (Priestley, Lavoisier), which is obtained from mercury and\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere, is also a reversible reaction by which\r\noxygen may be obtained from the atmosphere. So also, by passing dry air\r\nthrough a red-hot tube containing barium oxide, it is made to combine\r\nwith the oxygen of the air. In this reaction the so-called barium\r\nperoxide, BaO_{2}, is formed from the barium oxide, BaO, and at a higher\r\ntemperature the former evolves the absorbed oxygen, and leaves the\r\nbarium oxide originally taken.[7]\r\n\r\n  [6] A difference in the physical properties of both gases cannot be\r\n      here taken advantage of, because they are very similar in this\r\n      respect. Thus the density of oxygen is 16 times and of nitrogen\r\n      14 times greater than the density of hydrogen, and therefore\r\n      porous vessels cannot be here employed--the difference between\r\n      the times of their passage through a porous surface would be too\r\n      insignificant.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Graham's apparatus for the decomposition\r\n      of air by pumping it through india-rubber.]\r\n\r\n      Graham, however, succeeded in enriching air in oxygen by passing\r\n      it through india-rubber. This may be done in the following\r\n      way:--A common india-rubber cushion, E (Fig. 27), is taken, and\r\n      its orifice hermetically connected with an air-pump, or, better\r\n      still, a mercury aspirator (the Sprengel pump is designated by\r\n      the letters A, C, B). When the aspirator (Chapter II., Note 16)\r\n      has pumped out the air, which will be seen by the mercury running\r\n      out in an almost uninterrupted stream, and from its standing\r\n      approximately at the barometric height, then it may be clearly\r\n      observed that gas passes through the india-rubber. This is also\r\n      seen from the fact that bubbles of gas continually pass along\r\n      with the mercury. A minus pressure may be constantly maintained\r\n      in the cushion by pouring mercury into the funnel A, and screwing\r\n      up the pinchcock C, so that the stream flowing from it is small,\r\n      and then a portion of the air passing through the india-rubber\r\n      will be carried along with the mercury. This air may be collected\r\n      in the cylinder, R. Its composition proves to be about 42 volumes\r\n      of oxygen with 57 volumes of nitrogen, and one volume of carbonic\r\n      anhydride, whilst ordinary air contains only 21 volumes of oxygen\r\n      in 100 volumes. A square metre of india-rubber surface (of the\r\n      usual thickness) passes about 45 c.c. of such air per hour. This\r\n      experiment clearly shows that india-rubber is permeable to gases.\r\n      This may, by the way, be observed in common toy balloons filled\r\n      with coal-gas. They fall after a day or two, not because there\r\n      are holes in them, but because air penetrates into, and the gas\r\n      from, their interior, through the surface of the india-rubber of\r\n      which they are made. The rate of the passage of gases through\r\n      india-rubber does not, as Mitchell and Graham showed, depend\r\n      on their densities, and consequently its permeability is not\r\n      determined by orifices. It more resembles dialysis--that is, the\r\n      penetration of liquids through colloid surfaces. Equal volumes\r\n      of gases penetrate through india-rubber in periods of time which\r\n      are related to each other as follows:--carbonic anhydride, 100;\r\n      hydrogen, 247; oxygen, 532; marsh gas, 633; carbonic oxide,\r\n      1,220; nitrogen, 1,358. Hence nitrogen penetrates more slowly\r\n      than oxygen, and carbonic anhydride more quickly than other\r\n      gases. 2·556 volumes of oxygen and 13·585 volumes of carbonic\r\n      anhydride penetrate in the same time as one volume of nitrogen.\r\n      By multiplying these ratios by the amounts of these gases in air,\r\n      we obtain figures which are in almost the same proportion as the\r\n      volumes of the gases penetrating from air through india-rubber. If\r\n      the process of dialysis be repeated on the air which has already\r\n      passed through india-rubber, then a mixture containing 65 p.c. by\r\n      volume of oxygen is obtained. It may be thought that the cause\r\n      of this phenomenon is the absorption or occlusion (_see_ Chap.\r\n      II., Note 37) of gases by india-rubber and the evolution of the\r\n      gas dissolved in a vacuum; and, indeed, india-rubber does absorb\r\n      gases, especially carbonic anhydride. Graham called the above\r\n      method of the decomposition of air _atmolysis_.\r\n\r\n  [7] The preparation of oxygen by this method, which is due to\r\n      Boussingault, is conducted in a porcelain tube, which is placed\r\n      in a stove heated by charcoal, so that its ends project beyond\r\n      the stove. Barium oxide (which may be obtained by igniting barium\r\n      nitrate, previously dried) is placed in the tube, one end of\r\n      which is connected with a pair of bellows, or a gas-holder, for\r\n      keeping up a current of air through it. The air is previously\r\n      passed through a solution of caustic potash, to remove all\r\n      traces of carbonic anhydride, and it is very carefully dried\r\n      (for the hydrate BaH_{2}O_{2} does not give the peroxide). At a\r\n      _dark-red heat_ (500-600°) the oxide of barium absorbs oxygen\r\n      from the air, so that the gas leaving the tube consists almost\r\n      entirely of nitrogen. When the absorption ceases, the air will\r\n      pass through the tube unchanged, which may be recognised from the\r\n      fact that it supports combustion. The barium oxide is converted\r\n      into peroxide under these circumstances, and eleven parts of\r\n      barium oxide absorb about one part of oxygen by weight. When the\r\n      absorption ceases, one end of the tube is closed, a cork with a\r\n      gas-conducting tube is fixed into the other end, and the heat of\r\n      the stove is increased to a _bright-red heat_ (800°). At this\r\n      temperature the barium peroxide gives up all that oxygen which it\r\n      acquired at a dark-red heat--_i.e._ about one part by weight of\r\n      oxygen is evolved from twelve parts of barium peroxide. After the\r\n      evolution of the oxygen there remains the barium oxide which was\r\n      originally taken, so that air may be again passed over it, and\r\n      thus the preparation of oxygen from one and the same quantity of\r\n      barium oxide may be repeated many times. Oxygen has been produced\r\n      one hundred times from one mass of oxide by this method; all the\r\n      necessary precautions being taken, as regards the temperature of\r\n      the mass and the removal of moisture and carbonic acid from the\r\n      air. Unless these precautions be taken, the mass of oxide soon\r\n      spoils.\r\n\r\n      As oxygen may become of considerable technical use, from its\r\n      capacity for giving high temperatures and intense light in\r\n      the combustion of substances, its preparation directly from\r\n      air by practical methods forms a problem whose solution many\r\n      investigators continue to work at up to the present day. The\r\n      most practical methods are those of Tessié du Motay and Kassner.\r\n      The first is based on the fact that a mixture of equal weights\r\n      of manganese peroxide and caustic soda at an incipient red\r\n      heat (about 350°) absorbs oxygen from air, with the separation\r\n      of water, according to the equation MnO_{2} + 2NaHO + O =\r\n      Na_{2}MnO_{4} + H_{2}O. If superheated steam, at a temperature\r\n      of about 450°, be then passed through the mixture, the manganese\r\n      peroxide and caustic soda originally taken are regenerated, and\r\n      the oxygen held by them is evolved, according to the reverse\r\n      equation Na_{2}MnO_{4} + H_{2}O = MnO_{2} + 2NaHO + O. This mode\r\n      of preparing oxygen may be repeated for an infinite number of\r\n      times. The oxygen in combining liberates water, and steam, acting\r\n      on the resultant substance, evolves oxygen. Hence all that is\r\n      required for the preparation of oxygen by this method is fuel\r\n      and the alternate cutting off the supply of air and steam. In\r\n      Kassner's process (1891) a mixture of oxide of lead and lime (PbO\r\n      + 2CaO) is heated to redness in the presence of air, oxygen is\r\n      then absorbed and calcium plumbate, Ca_{2}PbO_{4}, formed. The\r\n      latter is of a chocolate colour, and on further heating evolves\r\n      oxygen and gives the original mixture PbO + 2CaO--that is, the\r\n      phenomenon is essentially the same as in Boussingault's process\r\n      (with BaO), but according to Le Chatelier (1893) the dissociation\r\n      tension of the oxygen evolved from Ca_{2}PbO_{4} is less than with\r\n      BaO_{2} at equal temperatures; for instance, at 940°, 112 mm. of\r\n      mercury for the first, and for the latter 210 mm. at 720°, and 670\r\n      mm. at 790°, while for Ca_{2}PbO_{4} this tension is only reached\r\n      at 1,080°. However, in Kassner's process the oxygen is absorbed\r\n      more rapidly, and the influence of the presence of moisture and\r\n      CO_{2} in the air is not so marked, so that this process, like\r\n      that of Tessié du Motay, deserves consideration.\r\n\r\nOxygen is evolved with particular ease by a whole series of unstable\r\noxygen compounds, of which we shall proceed to take a general survey,\r\nremarking that many of these reactions, although not all, belong to\r\nthe number of reversible reactions;[8] so that in order to obtain many\r\nof these substances (for instance, potassium chlorate) rich in oxygen,\r\nrecourse must be had to indirect methods (see Introduction) with which\r\nwe shall become acquainted in the course of this book.\r\n\r\n  [8] Even the decomposition of manganese peroxide is reversible, and it\r\n      may be re-obtained from that suboxide (or its salts), which\r\n      is formed in the evolution of oxygen (Chap. XI., Note 6). The\r\n      compounds of chromic acid containing the trioxide CrO_{3} in\r\n      evolving oxygen give chromium oxide, Cr_{2}O_{3}, but they re-form\r\n      the salt of chromic acid when heated to redness in air with an\r\n      alkali.\r\n\r\n1. _The compounds of oxygen_ with certain metals, and especially\r\nwith the so-called noble metals--that is, mercury, silver, gold, and\r\nplatinum--having once been obtained, retain their oxygen at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, but part with it at a red heat. The compounds are solids,\r\ngenerally amorphous and infusible, and are easily decomposed by heat\r\ninto the metal and oxygen. We have seen an example of this in speaking\r\nof the decomposition of mercury oxide. Priestley, in 1774, obtained\r\npure oxygen for the first time by heating mercury oxide by means of a\r\nburning-glass, and clearly showed its difference from air. He showed\r\nits characteristic property of supporting combustion 'with remarkable\r\nvigour,' and named it dephlogisticated air.\r\n\r\n2. The substances called _peroxides_[9] evolve oxygen at a greater or\r\nless heat (and also by the action of many acids). They usually contain\r\nmetals combined with a large quantity of oxygen. Peroxides are the\r\nhighest oxides of certain metals; those metals which form them generally\r\ngive several compounds with oxygen. Those of the lowest degrees of\r\noxidation, containing the least amount of oxygen, are generally\r\nsubstances which are capable of easily reacting with acids--for\r\ninstance, with sulphuric acid. Such low oxides are called bases.\r\nPeroxides contain more oxygen than the bases formed by the same metals.\r\nFor example, lead oxide contains 7·1 parts of oxygen in 100 parts, and\r\nis basic, but lead peroxide contains 13·3 parts of oxygen in 100 parts.\r\n_Manganese peroxide_ is a similar substance, and is a solid of a dark\r\ncolour, which occurs in nature. It is employed for technical purposes\r\nunder the name of black oxide of manganese (in German, 'Braunstein,' the\r\npyrolusite of the mineralogist). Peroxides are able to evolve oxygen\r\nat a more or less elevated temperature. They do not then part with all\r\ntheir oxygen, but with only a portion of it, and are converted into\r\na lower oxide or base. Thus, for example, lead peroxide, on heating,\r\ngives oxygen and lead oxide. The decomposition of this peroxide proceeds\r\ntolerably easily on heating, even in a glass vessel, but manganese\r\nperoxide only evolves oxygen at a strong red heat, and therefore oxygen\r\ncan only be obtained from it in iron, or other metallic, or clay\r\nvessels. This was formerly the method for obtaining oxygen. Manganese\r\nperoxide only parts with one-third of its oxygen (according to the\r\nequation 3MnO_{2} = Mn_{3}O_{4} + O_{2}), whilst two-thirds remain in\r\nthe solid substance which forms the residue after heating. Metallic\r\nperoxides are also capable of evolving oxygen on heating with sulphuric\r\nacid. They then evolve just that amount of oxygen which is in excess of\r\nthat necessary for the formation of the base, the latter reacting on the\r\nsulphuric acid forming a compound (salt) with it. Thus barium peroxide,\r\nwhen heated with sulphuric acid, forms oxygen and barium oxide, which\r\ngives a compound with sulphuric acid termed barium sulphate (BaO_{2}\r\n+ H_{2}SO_{4} = BaSO_{4} + H_{2}O + O).[9 bis] This reaction usually\r\nproceeds with greater ease than the decomposition of peroxides by heat\r\nalone. For the purposes of experiment powdered manganese peroxide is\r\nusually taken and mixed with strong sulphuric acid in a flask, and the\r\napparatus set up as shown in Fig. 28. The gas which is evolved is passed\r\nthrough a Woulfe's bottle containing a solution of caustic potash, to\r\npurify it from carbonic anhydride and chlorine, which accompany the\r\nevolution of oxygen from commercial manganese peroxide, and the gas is\r\nnot collected until a thin smouldering taper placed in front of the\r\nescape orifice bursts into flame, which shows that the gas coming off\r\nis oxygen. By this method of decomposition of the manganese peroxide by\r\nsulphuric acid there is evolved, not, as in heating, one-third, but\r\none-half of the oxygen contained in the peroxide (MnO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n= MnSO_{4} + H_{2}O + O)--that is, from 50 grams of peroxide about\r\n7-1/5 grams, or about 5-1/2 litres, of oxygen,[10] whilst by heating\r\nonly about 3-1/2 litres are obtained. The chemists of Lavoisier's time\r\ngenerally obtained oxygen by heating manganese peroxide. At the present\r\ntime more convenient methods are known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Preparation of oxygen from manganese peroxide\r\nand sulphuric acid. The gas evolved is passed through a Woulfe's bottle\r\ncontaining caustic potash.]\r\n\r\n  [9] We shall afterwards see that it is only substances like barium\r\n      peroxide (which give hydrogen peroxide) which should be counted\r\n      as true peroxides, and that MnO_{2}, PbO_{2}, &c., should be\r\n      distinguished from them (they do not give hydrogen peroxide with\r\n      acids), and therefore it is best to call them dioxides.\r\n\r\n  [9 bis] Peroxide of barium also gives oxygen at the ordinary\r\n      temperature in the presence of the solutions of many substances\r\n      in a higher degree of oxidation. In this respect we may mention\r\n      that Kassner (1890) proposes to obtain oxygen for laboratory\r\n      purposes by mixing BaO_{2} with FeK_{3}(CN)_{6} (red prussiate of\r\n      potash, Chapter XXII.): the reaction proceeds with the evolution\r\n      of oxygen even on the addition of a very small quantity of\r\n      water. In order to ensure a gradual evolution of gas the author\r\n      proposes to introduce both substances into the reaction, little\r\n      by little, instead of all at once, which may be done with the\r\n      following arrangement (Gavaloffsky): finely powdered peroxide\r\n      of barium is placed in an ordinary flask and sufficient water\r\n      is added to fill the flask one-third full. The cork closing the\r\n      flask has three holes; (1) for the gas-conducting tube; (2) for a\r\n      rod to stir the BaO_{2}; and (3) for a glass rod terminating in a\r\n      perforated glass vessel containing crystals of FeK_{3}(CN)_{6}.\r\n      When it is desired to start the evolution of the oxygen, the\r\n      vessel is lowered until it is immersed in the liquid in the flask,\r\n      and the BaO_{2} is stirred with the other rod. The reaction\r\n      proceeds according to the equation, BaO_{2} + 2FeK_{3}(CN)_{6}\r\n      = FeK_{4}(CN)_{6} + FeK_{2}Ba(CN)_{6} + O_{2}. The double salt,\r\n      FeBa_{2}(CN)_{6}, crystallises out from the mother liquor. To\r\n      understand the course of the reaction, it must be remembered\r\n      BaO_{2} is of a higher degree of oxidation, and that it parts\r\n      with oxygen and gives the base BaO which enters into the complex\r\n      salt FeK_{2}Ba(CN)_{6} = Fe(CN)_{2} + 2KCN + Ba(CN)_{2}, and this\r\n      latter = BaO + 2HCN-H_{2}O. Moreover, FeK_{3}(CN)_{6} contains the\r\n      salt Fe_{2}(CN)_{6} which also corresponds to the higher degree\r\n      of oxidation of iron, Fe_{2}O_{3}, whilst after the reaction a\r\n      salt is obtained which contains Fe(CN)_{2}, and corresponds to the\r\n      lower degree of oxidation, FeO, so that (in the presence of water)\r\n      oxygen is also set free on this side also, _i.e._ the reaction\r\n      gives lower degrees of oxidation and oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [10] Scheele, in 1785, discovered the method of obtaining oxygen by\r\n       treating manganese peroxide with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n3. A third source to which recourse may be had for obtaining oxygen is\r\nrepresented in _acids_ and _salts_ containing much oxygen, which are\r\ncapable, by parting with a portion or all of their oxygen, of being\r\nconverted into other compounds (lower products of oxidation) which are\r\nmore difficultly decomposed. These acids and salts (like peroxides)\r\nevolve oxygen either on heating alone, or only when in the presence\r\nof some other substance. Sulphuric acid may be taken as an example of\r\nan acid which is decomposed by the action of heat alone,[11] for it\r\nbreaks up at a red heat into water, sulphurous anhydride, and oxygen,\r\nas was mentioned before. Priestley, in 1772, and Scheele, somewhat\r\nlater, obtained oxygen by heating nitre to a red heat. The best\r\nexamples of the formation of oxygen by the heating of salts is given\r\nin _potassium chlorate_, or Berthollet's salt, so called after the\r\nFrench chemist who discovered it. Potassium chlorate is a salt composed\r\nof the elements potassium, chlorine, and oxygen, KClO_{3}. It occurs\r\nas transparent colourless plates, is soluble in water, especially in\r\nhot water, and resembles common table salt in some of its reactions\r\nand physical properties; it melts on heating, and in melting begins\r\nto decompose, evolving oxygen gas. This decomposition ends in all the\r\noxygen being evolved from the potassium chlorate, potassium chloride\r\nbeing left as a residue, according to the equation KClO_{3} = KCl +\r\nO_{3}.[12] This decomposition proceeds at a temperature which allows\r\nof its being conducted in a glass vessel. However, in decomposing,\r\nthe molten potassium chlorate swells up and boils, and gradually\r\nsolidifies, so the evolution of the oxygen is not regular, and the\r\nglass vessel may crack. In order to overcome this inconvenience, the\r\npotassium chlorate is crushed and mixed with a powder of a substance\r\nwhich is infusible, incapable of combining with the oxygen evolved,\r\nand is a good conductor of heat. Usually it is mixed with manganese\r\nperoxide.[13] The decomposition of the potassium chlorate is then\r\nconsiderably facilitated, and proceeds at a lower temperature (because\r\nthe entire mass is then better heated, both externally and internally),\r\nwithout swelling up, and this method is therefore more convenient than\r\nthe decomposition of the salt alone. This method for the preparation\r\nof oxygen is very convenient; it is generally employed when a small\r\nquantity of oxygen is required. Further, potassium chlorate is easily\r\nobtained pure, and it evolves much oxygen. 100 grams of the salt give as\r\nmuch as 39 grams, or 30 litres, of oxygen. This method is so simple and\r\neasy,[14] that a course of practical chemistry is often commenced by the\r\npreparation of oxygen by this method, and of hydrogen by the aid of zinc\r\nand sulphuric acid, since by means of these gases many interesting and\r\nstriking experiments may be performed.[15]\r\n\r\n  [11] All acids rich in oxygen, and especially those whose elements form\r\n       lower oxides, evolve oxygen either directly at the ordinary\r\n       temperature (for instance, ferric acid), or on heating (nitric,\r\n       manganic, chromic, chloric, and others), or if basic lower oxides\r\n       are formed from them, by heating with sulphuric acid. Thus\r\n       the salts of chromic acid (for example, potassium dichromate,\r\n       K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}) give oxygen with sulphuric acid; first\r\n       potassium sulphate, K_{2}SO_{4}, is formed, and then the chromic\r\n       acid set free gives a sulphuric acid salt of the lower oxide,\r\n       Cr_{2}O_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [12] This reaction is not reversible, and is exothermal--that is, it\r\n       does not absorb heat, but, on the contrary, evolves 9,713\r\n       calories per molecular weight KClO_{3}, equal to 122 parts of\r\n       salt (according to the determination of Thomsen, who burnt\r\n       hydrogen in a calorimeter either alone or with a definite\r\n       quantity of potassium chlorate mixed with oxide of iron). It does\r\n       not proceed at once, but first forms perchlorate, KClO_{4} (_see_\r\n       Chlorine and Potassium). It is to be remarked that potassium\r\n       chloride melts at 766°, potassium chlorate at 359°, and potassium\r\n       perchlorate at 610°. (Concerning the decomposition of KClO_{3},\r\n       _see_ Chapter II., Note 47.)\r\n\r\n  [13] The peroxide does not evolve oxygen in this case. It may be\r\n       replaced by many oxides--for instance, by oxide of iron. It is\r\n       necessary to take the precaution that no combustible substances\r\n       (such as bits of paper, splinters, sulphur, &c.) fall into the\r\n       mixture, as they might cause an explosion.\r\n\r\n  [14] The decomposition of a mixture of fused and well-crushed potassium\r\n       chlorate with powdered manganese peroxide proceeds at so low a\r\n       temperature (the salt does not melt) that it may be effected in\r\n       an ordinary glass flask. The apparatus is arranged in the same\r\n       manner as in the decomposition of mercury oxide (Introduction),\r\n       or as shown in the last drawing. As the reaction is exothermal,\r\n       the decomposition of potassium chlorate with the formation of\r\n       oxygen may probably be accomplished, under certain conditions\r\n       (for example, under contact action), at very low temperatures.\r\n       Substances mixed with the potassium chlorate probably act\r\n       partially in this manner.\r\n\r\n  [15] Many other salts evolve oxygen by heat, like potassium chlorate,\r\n       but they only part with it either at a very high temperature (for\r\n       instance, common nitre) or else are unsuited for use on account\r\n       of their cost (potassium manganate), or evolve impure oxygen at a\r\n       high temperature (zinc sulphate at a red heat gives a mixture of\r\n       sulphurous anhydride and oxygen), and are not therefore used in\r\n       practice.\r\n\r\nA solution of _bleaching powder_, which contains calcium hypochlorite,\r\nCaCl_{2}O_{2}, evolves oxygen on gently heating when a small quantity\r\nof certain oxides is added--for instance, cobalt oxide, which in this\r\ncase acts by contact (_see_ Introduction). When heated by itself, a\r\nsolution of bleaching powder does not evolve oxygen, but it oxidises\r\nthe cobalt oxide to a higher degree of oxidation; this higher oxide of\r\ncobalt in contact with the bleaching powder decomposes into oxygen and\r\nlower oxidation products, and the resultant lower oxide of cobalt with\r\nbleaching powder again gives the higher oxide, which again gives up\r\nits oxygen, and so on.[16] The calcium hypochlorite is here decomposed\r\naccording to the equation CaCl_{2}O_{2} = CaCl_{2} + O_{2}. In this\r\nmanner a small quantity of cobalt oxide[17] is sufficient for the\r\ndecomposition of an indefinitely large quantity of bleaching powder.\r\n\r\n  [16] Such is, at present, the only possible method of explaining the\r\n       phenomenon of contact action. In many cases, such as the present\r\n       one, it is supported by observations based on facts. Thus,\r\n       for instance, it is known, as regards oxygen, that often two\r\n       substances rich in oxygen retain it so long as they are separate,\r\n       but directly they come into contact free oxygen is evolved from\r\n       both of them. Thus, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide\r\n       (containing twice as much oxygen as water) acts in this manner on\r\n       silver oxide (containing silver and oxygen). This reaction takes\r\n       place at the ordinary temperature, and the oxygen is evolved\r\n       from both compounds. To this class of phenomena may be also\r\n       referred the fact that a mixture of barium peroxide and potassium\r\n       manganate with water and sulphuric acid evolves oxygen at the\r\n       ordinary temperature (Note 9 bis). It would seem that the essence\r\n       of phenomena of this kind is entirely and purely a property of\r\n       contact; the distribution of the atoms is changed by contact,\r\n       and if the equilibrium be unstable it is destroyed. This is more\r\n       especially evident in the case of those substances which change\r\n       exothermally--that is, for those reactions which are accompanied\r\n       by an evolution of heat. The decomposition CaCl_{2}O_{2} =\r\n       CaCl_{2} + O_{2} belongs to this class (like the decomposition of\r\n       potassium chlorate).\r\n\r\n  [17] Generally a solution of bleaching powder is alkaline (contains\r\n       free lime), and therefore, a solution of cobalt chloride is added\r\n       directly to it, by which means the oxide of cobalt required for\r\n       the reaction is formed.\r\n\r\n_The properties of oxygen._[18]--It is a permanent _gas_--that is,\r\nit cannot be liquefied by pressure at the ordinary temperature, and\r\nfurther, is only liquefied with difficulty (although more easily than\r\nhydrogen) at temperatures below -120°, because this is its absolute\r\nboiling point. As its critical pressure[19] is about 50 atmospheres, it\r\ncan be easily liquefied under pressures greater than 50 atmospheres at\r\ntemperatures below -120°. According to Dewar, the density of oxygen in\r\na critical state is 0·65 (water = 1), but, like all other substances\r\nin this state,[20] it varies considerably in density with a change of\r\npressure and temperature, and therefore many investigators who made\r\ntheir observations under high pressures give a greater density, as much\r\nas 1·1. Liquefied oxygen is an exceedingly mobile transparent liquid,\r\nwith a faint blue tint and boiling (tension = 1 atmosphere) about -180°.\r\nOxygen, like all gases, is transparent, and like the majority of gases,\r\ncolourless. It has no smell or taste, which is evident from the fact of\r\nits being a component of air. The weight of one litre of oxygen gas at\r\n0° and 760 mm. pressure is 1·4298 gram; it is therefore slightly denser\r\nthan air. Its density in respect to air = 1·1056 and in respect to\r\nhydrogen = 16.[21]\r\n\r\n  [18] It must be remarked that in all the reactions above mentioned the\r\n       formation of oxygen may be prevented by the admixture of\r\n       substances capable of combining with it--for example, charcoal,\r\n       many carbon (organic) compounds, sulphur, phosphorus, and various\r\n       lower oxidation products, &c. These substances absorb the oxygen\r\n       evolved, combine with it, and a compound containing oxygen is\r\n       formed. Thus, if a mixture of potassium chlorate and charcoal be\r\n       heated, no oxygen is obtained, but an explosion takes place from\r\n       the rapid formation of gases resulting from the combination of\r\n       the oxygen of the potassium chlorate with the charcoal and the\r\n       evolution of gaseous CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n       The oxygen obtained by any of the above-described methods is\r\n       rarely pure. It generally contains aqueous vapour, carbonic\r\n       anhydride, and very often small traces of chlorine. The oxygen\r\n       may be freed from these impurities by passing it through a\r\n       solution of caustic potash, and by drying it. If the potassium\r\n       chlorate be dry and pure, it gives almost pure oxygen. However,\r\n       if the oxygen be required for respiration in cases of sickness,\r\n       it should be washed by passing it through a solution of caustic\r\n       alkali and through water. The best way to obtain pure oxygen\r\n       directly is to take potassium perchlorate (KClO_{4}), which can\r\n       be well purified and then evolves pure oxygen on heating.\r\n\r\n  [19] With regard to the absolute boiling point, critical pressure, and\r\n       the critical state in general, _see_ Chapter II., Notes 29 and 34.\r\n\r\n  [20] Judging from what has been said in Note 34 of the last chapter,\r\n       and also from the results of direct observation, it is evident\r\n       that all substances in a critical state have a large coefficient\r\n       of expansion, and are very compressible.\r\n\r\n  [21] As water consists of 1 volume of oxygen and 2 volumes of hydrogen,\r\n       and contains 16 parts by weight of oxygen per 2 parts by weight\r\n       of hydrogen, it therefore follows directly that oxygen is 16\r\n       times denser than hydrogen. Conversely, the composition of water\r\n       by weight may be deduced from the densities of hydrogen and\r\n       oxygen, and the volumetric composition of water. This method of\r\n       mutual and reciprocal correction strengthens the practical data\r\n       of the exact sciences, whose conclusions require the greatest\r\n       possible exactitude and variety of corrections.\r\n\r\n       It must he observed that the specific heat of oxygen at constant\r\n       pressure is 0·2175, consequently it is to the specific heat of\r\n       hydrogen (3·409) as 1 is to 15·6. Hence, the specific heats are\r\n       inversely proportional to the weights of equal volumes. This\r\n       signifies that equal volumes of both gases have (nearly) equal\r\n       specific heats--that is, they require an equal quantity of heat\r\n       for raising their temperature by 1°. We shall afterwards consider\r\n       the specific heat of different substances more fully in Chap. XIV.\r\n\r\n       Oxygen, like the majority of difficultly-liquefiable gases, is\r\n       but slightly soluble in water and other liquids. The solubility\r\n       is given in Note 30, Chap. I. From this it is evident that water\r\n       standing in air must absorb--_i.e._ dissolve--oxygen. This oxygen\r\n       serves for the respiration of fishes. Fishes cannot exist in\r\n       boiled water, because it does not contain the oxygen necessary\r\n       for their respiration (_see_ Chap. I.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Mode of burning sulphur, phosphorus, sodium,\r\n&c., in oxygen.]\r\n\r\nIn its chemical properties oxygen is remarkable from the fact that\r\nit very easily--and, in a chemical sense, vigorously--reacts on a\r\nnumber of substances, forming oxygen compounds. However, only a few\r\nsubstances and mixtures of substances (for example, phosphorus, copper\r\nwith ammonia, decomposing organic matter, aldehyde, pyrogallol with an\r\nalkali, &c.) combine directly with oxygen at the ordinary temperature,\r\nwhilst many substances easily combine with oxygen at a red heat, and\r\noften this combination presents a rapid chemical reaction accompanied by\r\nthe evolution of a large quantity of heat. Every reaction which takes\r\nplace rapidly, if it be accompanied by so great an evolution of heat\r\nas to produce incandescence, is termed _combustion_. Thus combustion\r\nensues when many metals are plunged into chlorine, or oxide of sodium\r\nor barium into carbonic anhydride, or when a spark falls on gunpowder.\r\nA great many substances are combustible in oxygen, and, owing to its\r\npresence, in air also. In order to start combustion it is generally\r\nnecessary[22] that the combustible substance should be brought to a\r\nstate of incandescence. The continuation of the process does not require\r\nthe aid of fresh external heat, because sufficient heat[23] is evolved\r\nto raise the temperature of the remaining parts of the combustible\r\nsubstance to the required degree. Examples of this are familiar to all\r\nfrom every-day experience. Combustion proceeds in oxygen with greater\r\nrapidity, and is accompanied by a more powerful incandescence, than in\r\nordinary air. This may be demonstrated by a number of very convincing\r\nexperiments. If a piece of charcoal, attached to a wire and previously\r\nbrought to red-heat, be plunged into a flask full of oxygen, it burns\r\nrapidly at a white heat--_i.e._ it combines with the oxygen, forming a\r\ngaseous product of combustion called carbonic anhydride, or carbonic\r\nacid gas, CO_{2}. This is the same gas that is evolved in the act of\r\nrespiration, for charcoal is one of the substances which is obtained by\r\nthe decomposition of all organic substances which contain it, and in\r\nthe process of respiration part of the constituents of the body, so to\r\nspeak, slowly burn. If a piece of burning sulphur be placed in a small\r\ncup attached to a wire and introduced into a flask full of oxygen, then\r\nthe sulphur, which burns in air with a very feeble flame, burns in the\r\noxygen with a violet flame, which, although pale, is much larger than\r\nin air. If the sulphur be exchanged for a piece of phosphorus,[24]\r\nthen, unless the phosphorus be heated, it combines very slowly with\r\nthe oxygen; but, if heated, although on only one spot, it burns with\r\nan exceedingly brilliant white flame. In order to heat the phosphorus\r\ninside the flask, the simplest way is to bring a red-hot wire into\r\ncontact with it. Before the charcoal can burn, it must be brought to\r\na state of incandescence. Sulphur also will not burn under 100°,\r\nwhilst phosphorus inflames at 40°. Phosphorus which has been already\r\nlighted in air cannot so well be introduced into the flask, because\r\nit burns very rapidly and with a large flame in air. If a small lump\r\nof metallic _sodium_ be put in a small cup made of lime,[25] melted,\r\nand ignited,[26] it burns very feebly in air. But if burning sodium be\r\nintroduced into oxygen, the combustion is invigorated and is accompanied\r\nby a brighter yellow flame. Metallic _magnesium_, which burns brightly\r\nin air, continues to burn with still greater vigour in oxygen, forming\r\na white powder, which is a compound of magnesium with oxygen (magnesium\r\noxide; magnesia). A strip of _iron_ or steel does not burn in air, but\r\nan iron wire or steel spring may be easily burnt in oxygen.[27] The\r\ncombustion of steel or iron in oxygen is not accompanied by a flame, but\r\nsparks of oxide fly in all directions from the burning portions of the\r\niron.[28]\r\n\r\n  [22] Certain substances (with which we shall afterwards become\r\n       acquainted), however, ignite spontaneously in air; for example,\r\n       impure phosphuretted hydrogen, silicon hydride, zinc ethyl, and\r\n       pyrophorus (very finely divided iron, &c.)\r\n\r\n  [23] If so little heat is evolved that the adjacent parts are not\r\n       heated to the temperature of combustion, then combustion will\r\n       cease.\r\n\r\n  [24] The phosphorus must be dry; it is usually kept in water, as\r\n       it oxidises in air. It should be cut under water, as otherwise\r\n       the freshly-cut surface oxidises. It must be dried carefully and\r\n       quickly by wrapping it in blotting-paper. If damp, it splutters\r\n       on burning. A small piece should be taken, as otherwise the iron\r\n       spoon will melt. In this and the other experiments on combustion,\r\n       water should be poured over the bottom of the vessel containing\r\n       the oxygen, to prevent it from cracking. The cork closing\r\n       the vessel should not fit tightly, in order to allow for the\r\n       expansion of the gas due to the heat of the combustion.\r\n\r\n  [25] An iron cup will melt with sodium in oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [26] In order to rapidly heat the lime crucible containing the sodium,\r\n       it is heated in the flame of a blowpipe described in Chap. VIII.\r\n\r\n  [27] In order to burn a watch spring, a piece of tinder (or paper\r\n       soaked in a solution of nitre, and dried) is attached to one\r\n       end. The tinder is lighted, and the spring is then plunged into\r\n       the oxygen. The burning tinder heats the end of the spring, the\r\n       heated part burns, and in so doing heats the further portions of\r\n       the spring, which then burns completely if sufficient oxygen be\r\n       present.\r\n\r\n  [28] The sparks of rust are produced, owing to the fact that the volume\r\n       of the oxide of iron is nearly twice that of the volume of the\r\n       iron, and as the heat evolved is not sufficient to entirely melt\r\n       the oxide or the iron, the particles must be torn off and fly\r\n       about. Similar sparks are formed in the combustion of iron, in\r\n       other cases also. We saw the combustion of iron filings in the\r\n       Introduction. In the welding of iron small iron splinters fly off\r\n       in all directions and burn in the air, as is seen from the fact\r\n       that whilst flying through the air they remain red hot, and also\r\n       because, on cooling, they are seen to be no longer iron, but a\r\n       compound of it with oxygen. The same thing takes place when the\r\n       hammer of a gun strikes against the flint. Small scales of steel\r\n       are heated by the friction, and glow and burn in the air. The\r\n       combustion of iron is still better seen by taking it as a very\r\n       fine powder, such as is obtained by the decomposition of certain\r\n       of its compounds--for instance, by heating Prussian blue, or by\r\n       the reduction of its compounds with oxygen by hydrogen; when this\r\n       fine powder is strewn in air, it burns by itself, even without\r\n       being previously heated (it forms a pyrophorus). This obviously\r\n       depends on the fact that the powder of iron presents a larger\r\n       surface of contact with air than an equal weight in a compact\r\n       form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Mode of burning a steel spring in oxygen.]\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate by experiment the _combustion of hydrogen_ in\r\noxygen, a gas-conducting tube, bent so as to form a convenient jet,\r\nis led from the vessel evolving hydrogen. The hydrogen is first set\r\nlight to in air, and then the gas-conducting tube is let down into a\r\nflask containing oxygen. The combustion in oxygen will be similar to\r\nthat in air; the flame remains pale, notwithstanding the fact that its\r\ntemperature rises considerably. It is instructive to remark that oxygen\r\nmay burn in hydrogen, just as hydrogen in oxygen. In order to show the\r\ncombustion of oxygen in hydrogen, a tube bent vertically upwards and\r\nending in a fine orifice is attached to the stopcock of a gas-holder\r\nfull of oxygen. Two wires, placed at such a distance from each other as\r\nto allow the passage of a constant series of sparks from a Ruhmkorff's\r\ncoil, are fixed in front of the orifice of the tube. This is in order to\r\nignite the oxygen, which may also be done by attaching tinder round the\r\norifice, and burning it. When the wires are arranged at the orifice of\r\nthe tube, and a series of sparks passes between them, then an inverted\r\n(because of the lightness of the hydrogen) jar full of hydrogen is\r\nplaced over the gas-conducting tube. When the jar covers the orifice of\r\nthe gas-conducting tube (and not before, as otherwise an explosion might\r\ntake place) the cock of the gasometer is opened, and the oxygen flows\r\ninto the hydrogen and is set light to by the sparks. The flame obtained\r\nis similar to that formed by the combustion of hydrogen in oxygen.[29]\r\nFrom this it is evident that the flame is the locality where the oxygen\r\ncombines with the hydrogen, therefore a flame of burning oxygen can be\r\nobtained as well as a flame of burning hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [29] The experiment may be conducted without the wires, if the hydrogen\r\n       be lighted in the orifice of an inverted cylinder, and at\r\n       the same time the cylinder be brought over the end of a\r\n       gas-conducting tube connected with a gas-holder containing\r\n       oxygen. Thomsen's method may be adopted for a lecture experiment.\r\n       Two glass tubes, with platinum ends, are passed through orifices,\r\n       about 1-1-1/2 centimetre apart, in a cork. One tube is connected\r\n       with a gas-holder containing oxygen, and the other with a\r\n       gas-holder full of hydrogen. Having turned on the gases, the\r\n       hydrogen is lighted, and a common lamp glass, tapering towards\r\n       the top, is placed over the cork. The hydrogen continues to burn\r\n       inside the lamp glass, at the expense of the oxygen. If the\r\n       current of oxygen be then decreased little by little, a point is\r\n       reached when, owing to the insufficient supply of oxygen, the\r\n       flame of the hydrogen increases in size, disappears for several\r\n       moments, and then reappears at the tube supplying the oxygen. If\r\n       the flow of oxygen be again increased, the flame reappears at the\r\n       hydrogen tube. Thus the flame may be made to appear at one or the\r\n       other tube at will, only the increase or decrease of the current\r\n       of gas must take place by degrees and not suddenly. Further, air\r\n       may be taken instead of oxygen, and ordinary coal-gas instead\r\n       of hydrogen, and it will then be shown how air burns in an\r\n       atmosphere of coal-gas, and it can easily be proved that the lamp\r\n       glass is full of a gas combustible in air, because it may be\r\n       lighted at the top.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of hydrogen, any other combustible gas be taken--for\r\nexample, ordinary coal gas--then the phenomenon of combustion will\r\nbe exactly the same, only a bright flame will be obtained, and the\r\nproducts of combustion will be different. However, as coal gas contains\r\na considerable amount of free and combined hydrogen, it will also form a\r\nconsiderable quantity of water in its combustion.\r\n\r\nIf hydrogen be mixed with oxygen in the proportion in which they form\r\nwater--_i.e._ if two volumes of hydrogen be taken for each volume of\r\noxygen--then the mixture will be the same as that obtained by the\r\ndecomposition of water by a galvanic current--detonating gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Cavendish's apparatus for exploding detonating\r\ngas. The bell jar standing in the bath is filled with a mixture of two\r\nvolumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and the thick glass vessel\r\nA is then screwed on to it. The air is first pumped out of this vessel,\r\nso that when the stopcock C is opened, it becomes filled with detonating\r\ngas. The stopcock is then re-closed, and the explosion produced by means\r\nof a spark from a Leyden jar. After the explosion has taken place the\r\nstopcock is again opened, and the water rises into the vessel A.]\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned in the last chapter that the combination of\r\nthese gases, or their explosion, may be brought about by the action of\r\nan electric spark, because the spark heats the space through which it\r\npasses, and acts consequently in a manner similar to ignition by means\r\nof contact with an incandescent or burning substance.[29 bis] Cavendish\r\nmade this experiment on the ignition of detonating gas, at the end of\r\nthe last century, in the apparatus shown in fig. 31. Ignition by the aid\r\nof the electric spark is convenient, for the reason that it may then\r\nbe brought about in a closed vessel, and hence chemists still employ\r\nthis method when it is required to ignite a mixture of oxygen with a\r\ncombustible gas in a closed vessel. For this purpose, especially since\r\nBunsen's time,[30] an _eudiometer_ is employed. It consists of a thick\r\nglass tube graduated along its length in millimetres (for indicating\r\nthe height of the mercury column), and calibrated for a definite volume\r\n(weight of mercury). Two platinum wires are fused into the upper closed\r\nend of the tube, as shown in fig. 32.[31] By the aid of the eudiometer\r\nwe may not only determine the volumetric composition of water,[32] and\r\nthe quantitative contents of oxygen in air,[33] but also make a number\r\nof experiments explaining the phenomenon of combustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Eudiometer]\r\n\r\n  [29 bis] In fact, instead of a spark a fine wire may be taken, and\r\n       an electric current passed through it to bring it to a state of\r\n       incandescence; in this case there will be no sparks, but the\r\n       gases will inflame if the wire be fine enough to become red hot\r\n       by the passage of the current.\r\n\r\n  [30] Now, a great many other different forms of apparatus, sometimes\r\n       designed for special purposes, are employed in the laboratory for\r\n       the investigation of gases. Detailed descriptions of the methods\r\n       of gas analysis, and of the apparatus employed, must be looked\r\n       for in works on analytical and applied chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [31] They must be sealed into the tube in such a manner as to leave\r\n       no aperture between them and the glass. In order to test this,\r\n       the eudiometer is filled with mercury, and its open end inverted\r\n       into mercury. If there be the smallest orifice at the wires, the\r\n       external air will enter into the cylinder and the mercury will\r\n       fall, although not rapidly if the orifice be very fine.\r\n\r\n  [32] The eudiometer is used for determining the composition of\r\n       combustible gases. A detailed account of _gas analysis_ would be\r\n       out of place in this work (_see_ Note 30), but, as an example,\r\n       we will give a short description of the determination of the\r\n       composition of water by the eudiometer.\r\n\r\n       Pure and dry oxygen is first introduced into the eudiometer. When\r\n       the eudiometer and the gas in it acquire the temperature of the\r\n       surrounding atmosphere--which is recognised by the fact of the\r\n       meniscus of the mercury not altering its position during a long\r\n       period of time--then the heights at which the mercury stands in\r\n       the eudiometer and in the bath are observed. The difference (in\r\n       millimetres) gives the height of the column of mercury in the\r\n       eudiometer. It must be reduced to the height at which the mercury\r\n       would stand at 0° and deducted from the atmospheric pressure, in\r\n       order to find the pressure under which the oxygen is measured\r\n       (_see_ Chap. I. Note 29). The height of the mercury also shows\r\n       the volume of the oxygen. The temperature of the surrounding\r\n       atmosphere and the height of the barometric column must also\r\n       be observed, in order to know the temperature of the oxygen\r\n       and the atmospheric pressure. When the volume of the oxygen\r\n       has been measured, pure and dry hydrogen is introduced into\r\n       the eudiometer, and the volume of the gases in the eudiometer\r\n       again measured. They are then exploded. This is done by a Leyden\r\n       jar, whose outer coating is connected by a chain with one wire,\r\n       so that a spark passes when the other wire, fused into the\r\n       eudiometer, is touched by the terminal of the jar. Or else an\r\n       electrophorus is used, or, better still, a Ruhmkorff's coil,\r\n       which has the advantage of working equally well in damp or dry\r\n       air, whilst a Leyden jar or electrical machine does not act in\r\n       damp weather. Further, it is necessary to close the lower orifice\r\n       of the eudiometer before the explosion (for this purpose the\r\n       eudiometer, which is fixed in a stand, is firmly pressed down\r\n       from above on to a piece of india-rubber placed at the bottom\r\n       of the bath), as otherwise the mercury and gas would be thrown\r\n       out of the apparatus by the explosion. It must also be remarked\r\n       that to ensure complete combustion the proportion between the\r\n       volumes of oxygen and hydrogen must not exceed twelve of hydrogen\r\n       to one volume of oxygen, or fifteen volumes of oxygen to one\r\n       volume of hydrogen, because no explosion will take place if one\r\n       of the gases be in great excess. It is best to take a mixture\r\n       of one volume of hydrogen with several volumes of oxygen. The\r\n       combustion will then be complete. It is evident that water is\r\n       formed, and that the volume (or tension) is diminished, so that\r\n       on opening the end of the eudiometer the mercury will rise in\r\n       it. But the tension of the aqueous vapour is now added to the\r\n       tension of the gas remaining after the explosion. This must be\r\n       taken into account (Chap. I. Note 1). If but little gas remain,\r\n       the water which is formed will be sufficient for its saturation\r\n       with aqueous vapour. This may be learnt from the fact that drops\r\n       of water are visible on the sides of the eudiometer after the\r\n       mercury has risen in it. If there be none, a certain quantity of\r\n       water must be introduced into the eudiometer. Then the number of\r\n       millimetres expressing the pressure of the vapour corresponding\r\n       with the temperature of the experiment must be subtracted from\r\n       the atmospheric pressure at which the remaining gas is measured,\r\n       otherwise the result will be inaccurate (Chap. I. Note 1).\r\n\r\n       This is essentially the method of the determination of the\r\n       composition of water which was made for the first time by\r\n       Gay-Lussac and Humboldt with sufficient accuracy. Their\r\n       determinations led them to the conclusion that water consists of\r\n       two volumes of hydrogen (more exactly 2·003, Le Duc 1892), and\r\n       one volume of oxygen. Every time they took a greater quantity of\r\n       oxygen, the gas remaining after the explosion was oxygen. When\r\n       they took an excess of hydrogen, the remaining gas was hydrogen;\r\n       and when the oxygen and hydrogen were taken in exactly the above\r\n       proportion, neither one nor the other remained. The composition\r\n       of water was thus definitely confirmed.\r\n\r\n  [33] Concerning this application of the eudiometer, see the chapter\r\n       on Nitrogen. It may be mentioned as illustrating the various uses\r\n       of the eudiometer that Prof. Timeraseeff employed microscopically\r\n       small eudiometers to analyse the bubbles of gas given off from\r\n       the leaves of plants.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, it may be demonstrated, by the aid of the eudiometer,\r\nthat for the ignition of detonating gas, a _definite temperature_\r\nis required. If the temperature be below that required, combination\r\nwill not take place, but if at any spot within the tube it rises to\r\nthe temperature of inflammation, then combination will ensue at that\r\nspot, and evolve enough heat for the ignition of the adjacent portions\r\nof the detonating mixture. If to 1 volume of detonating gas there be\r\nadded 10 volumes of oxygen, or 4 volumes of hydrogen, or 3 volumes of\r\ncarbonic anhydride, then we shall not obtain an explosion by passing a\r\nspark through the diluted mixture. This depends on the fact that the\r\ntemperature falls with the dilution of the detonating gas by another\r\ngas, because the heat evolved by the combination of the small quantity\r\nof hydrogen and oxygen brought to incandescence by the spark is not\r\nonly transmitted to the water proceeding from the combination, but\r\nalso to the foreign substance mixed with the detonating gas.[34] The\r\nnecessity of a definite temperature for the ignition of detonating gas\r\nis also seen from the fact that pure detonating gas explodes in the\r\npresence of a red-hot iron wire, or of charcoal heated to 275°, but\r\nwith a lower degree of incandescence there is not any explosion. It may\r\nalso be brought about by rapid compression, when, as is known, heat\r\nis evolved.[35] Experiments made in the eudiometer showed that the\r\nignition of detonating gas takes place at a temperature between 450°\r\nand 560°.[36]\r\n\r\n  [34] Thus 1/4 volume of carbonic oxide, an equal volume of marsh gas,\r\n       two volumes of hydrogen chloride or of ammonia, and six volumes\r\n       of nitrogen or twelve volumes of air added to one volume of\r\n       detonating gas, prevent its explosion.\r\n\r\n  [35] If the compression be brought about slowly, so that the heat\r\n       evolved succeeds in passing to the surrounding space, then the\r\n       combination of the oxygen and hydrogen does not take place, even\r\n       when the mixture is compressed by 150 times; for the gases are\r\n       not heated. If paper soaked with a solution of platinum (in aqua\r\n       regia) and sal ammoniac be burnt, then the ash obtained contains\r\n       very finely-divided platinum, and in this form it is best fitted\r\n       for igniting hydrogen and detonating gas. Platinum wire requires\r\n       to be heated, but platinum in so finely divided a state as it\r\n       occurs in this ash inflames hydrogen, even at -20°. Many other\r\n       metals, such as palladium (175°), iridium, and gold, act with a\r\n       slight rise of temperature, like platinum; but mercury, at its\r\n       boiling point, does not inflame detonating gas, although the\r\n       slow formation of water then begins at 305°. All data of this\r\n       kind show that the explosion of detonating gas presents one of\r\n       the many cases of contact phenomena. This conclusion is further\r\n       confirmed by the researches of V. Meyer (1892). He showed that\r\n       only a very slow formation of steam begins at 448°, and that\r\n       it only proceeds more rapidly at 518°. The temperature of the\r\n       explosion of detonating gas, according to the same author,\r\n       varies according as to whether the explosion is produced in open\r\n       vessels or in closed tubes. In the first case the temperature\r\n       of explosion lies between 530°-606°, and in the second between\r\n       630°-730°. In general it may be remarked that the temperature of\r\n       explosion of gaseous mixtures is always lower in closed vessels\r\n       than when the detonating mixture flows freely through tubes.\r\n       According to Freyer and V. Meyer, the following gases when mixed\r\n       with the requisite amount of oxygen explode at the following\r\n       temperatures:\r\n\r\n       +----------------+---------------------+-------------------+\r\n       |      --        | When flowing freely | In closed vessels |\r\n       +----------------+---------------------+-------------------+\r\n       | H_{2}          |     630°-730°       |     530°-606°     |\r\n       | CH_{4}         |     650°-730°       |     606°-650°     |\r\n       | C_{2}H_{6}     |     606°-650°       |     530°-606°     |\r\n       | C_{2}H_{4}     |     606°-650°       |     530°-606°     |\r\n       | CO             |     650°-730°       |     650°-730°     |\r\n       | H_{2}S         |     315°-320°       |     250°-270°     |\r\n       | H_{2} + Cl_{2} |     430°-440°       |     240°-270°     |\r\n       +----------------+---------------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n       The velocity of the transmission of explosion in gaseous mixtures\r\n       is as characteristic a quantity for gaseous systems as the\r\n       velocity of the transmission of sound. Berthelot showed that this\r\n       velocity depends neither upon the pressure nor upon the size of\r\n       the tubes in which the gaseous mixture is contained, nor upon the\r\n       material out of which the tube is made. Dixon (1891) determined\r\n       the magnitude of these velocities for various mixtures, and his\r\n       results proved very near to those previously given by Berthelot.\r\n       For comparison we give the velocities expressed in metres per\r\n       second:\r\n\r\n                 +-----------------+-------+-----------+\r\n                 |       --        | Dixon | Berthelot |\r\n                 +-----------------+-------+-----------+\r\n                 | H_{2} + O       | 2,821 |   2,810   |\r\n                 | H_{2} + N_{2}O  | 2,305 |   2,284   |\r\n                 | CH_{4} + 4O     | 2,322 |   2,287   |\r\n                 | C_{2}H_{2} + 6O | 2,364 |   2,210   |\r\n                 | C_{2}H_{2} + 5O | 2,391 |   2,482   |\r\n                 | C_{2}N_{2} + 4O | 2,321 |   2,195   |\r\n                 +-----------------+-------+-----------+\r\n\r\n       The addition of oxygen to detonating gas lowers the velocity of\r\n       the transmission of explosion almost as much as the introduction\r\n       of nitrogen. An excess of hydrogen on the contrary raises the\r\n       velocity of transmission. It is remarked that the explosion\r\n       of mixtures of oxygen with marsh gas, ethylene and cyanogen\r\n       is transmitted more quickly if the oxygen be taken in such a\r\n       proportion that the carbon should burn to oxide of carbon, _i.e._\r\n       the velocity of the explosion is less if the oxygen be taken in\r\n       sufficient quantity to form carbonic anhydride. Observations upon\r\n       liquid and solid explosives (Berthelot) show that in this case\r\n       the velocity of transmission of explosion is dependent upon the\r\n       material of the tube. Thus the explosion of liquid nitro-methyl\r\n       ether in glass tubes travels at the rate (in dependence upon\r\n       the diam., from 1 mm.-45 mm.) of from 1,890 to 2,482 metres,\r\n       and in tubes of Britannia metal (3 mm. in diam) at the rate of\r\n       1,230 metres. The harder the tube the greater the velocity of\r\n       transmission of explosion. The following are the velocities for\r\n       certain bodies:\r\n\r\n                                                metres\r\n                  Nitro-glycerine                1,300\r\n                  Dynamite                       2,500\r\n                  Nitro-mannite                  7,700\r\n                  Picric acid                    6,500\r\n\r\n       In conclusion we may add that Mallard and Le Chatelier (1882)\r\n       observed that in the explosion of a mixture of 1 volume of\r\n       detonating gas with _n_ volumes of an inert gas, the pressure is\r\n       approximately equal to 9·2-0·9_n_ atmospheres.\r\n\r\n  [36] From the very commencement of the promulgation of the idea of\r\n       dissociation, it might have been imagined that reversible\r\n       reactions of combination (the formation of H_{2} and O belongs\r\n       to this number) commence at the same temperature as that at\r\n       which dissociation begins. And in many cases this is so, but\r\n       not always, as may be seen from the facts (1) that at 450-560°,\r\n       when detonating gas explodes, the density of aqueous vapour not\r\n       only does not vary (and it hardly varies at higher temperatures,\r\n       probably because the amount of the products of dissociation is\r\n       small), but there are not, as far as is yet known, any traces\r\n       of dissociation; (2) that under the influence of contact the\r\n       temperature at which combination takes place falls even to the\r\n       ordinary temperature, when water and similar compounds naturally\r\n       are not dissociated and, judging from the data communicated\r\n       by D. P. Konovaloff (Introduction, Note 39) and others, it is\r\n       impossible to escape the phenomena of contact; all vessels,\r\n       whether of metal or glass, show the same influence as spongy\r\n       platinum, although to a much less degree. The phenomena of\r\n       contact, judging from a review of the data referring to it,\r\n       must be especially sensitive in reactions which are powerfully\r\n       exothermal, and the explosion of detonating gas is of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe combination of hydrogen with oxygen is accompanied by the evolution\r\nof a very considerable amount of heat; according to the determinations\r\nof _Favre_ and _Silbermann_,[37] 1 part by weight of hydrogen in\r\nforming water evolves 34,462 units of heat. Many of the most recent\r\ndeterminations are very close to this figure, so that it may be taken\r\nthat in the formation of 18 parts of water (H_{2}O) there are evolved 69\r\nmajor calories, or 69,000 units of heat.[38] _If the specific heat of\r\naqueous vapour_ (0·48) _remained constant from the ordinary temperature\r\nto that at which the combustion of detonating gas takes place_\r\n(but there is now no doubt that it increases), were the combustion\r\nconcentrated at one point[39] (but it occurs in the whole region of a\r\nflame), were there no loss from radiation and heat conduction, and _did\r\ndissociation not take place_--that is, did not a state of equilibrium\r\nbetween the hydrogen, oxygen, and water come about--_then it would be\r\npossible to calculate the temperature of the flame of detonating gas_.\r\nIt would then be 8,000°.[40] In reality it is very much lower, but it\r\nis nevertheless higher than the temperature attained in furnaces and\r\nflames, and is as high as 2,000°. The explosion of detonating gas is\r\nexplained by this high temperature, because the aqueous vapour formed\r\nmust occupy a volume at least 5 times greater than that occupied by\r\nthe detonating gas at the ordinary temperature. Detonating gas emits a\r\nsound, not only as a consequence of the commotion which occurs from the\r\nrapid expansion of the heated vapour, but also because it is immediately\r\nfollowed by a cooling effect, the conversion of the vapour into water,\r\nand a rapid contraction.[41]\r\n\r\n  [37] [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Favre and Silbermann's calorimeter for\r\n       determining the heat evolved in combustion.]\r\n\r\n       The amount of heat evolved in the combustion of a known weight\r\n       (for instance, 1 gram) of a given substance is determined by the\r\n       rise in temperature of water, to which the whole of the heat\r\n       evolved in the combustion is transmitted. A _calorimeter_, for\r\n       example that shown in fig. 33, is employed for this purpose.\r\n       It consists of a thin (in order that it may absorb less heat),\r\n       polished (that it should transmit a minimum of heat) metallic\r\n       vessel, surrounded by down (_c_), or some other bad conductor\r\n       of heat, and an outer metallic vessel. This is necessary in\r\n       order that the least possible amount of heat should be lost\r\n       from the vessels; nevertheless, there is always a certain loss,\r\n       whose magnitude is determined by preliminary experiment (by\r\n       taking warm water, and determining its fall in temperature after\r\n       a definite period of time) as a correction for the results\r\n       of observations. The water to which the heat of the burning\r\n       substance is transmitted is poured into the vessel. The stirrer\r\n       _g_ allows of all the layers of water being brought to the same\r\n       temperature, and the thermometer serves for the determination\r\n       of the temperature of the water. The heat evolved passes,\r\n       naturally, not to the water only, but to all the parts of the\r\n       apparatus. The quantity of water corresponding to the whole\r\n       amount of those objects (the vessels, tubes, &c.) to which the\r\n       heat is transmitted is previously determined, and in this manner\r\n       another most important correction is made in the calorimetric\r\n       determinations. The combustion itself is carried on in the vessel\r\n       _a_. The ignited substance is introduced through the tube at the\r\n       top, which closes tightly. In fig. 33 the apparatus is arranged\r\n       for the combustion of a gas, introduced by a tube. The oxygen\r\n       required for the combustion is led into _a_ by the tube _e_, and\r\n       the products of combustion either remain in the vessel _a_ (if\r\n       liquid or solid), or escape by the tube _f_ into an apparatus in\r\n       which their quantity and properties can easily be determined.\r\n       Thus the heat evolved in combustion passes to the walls of the\r\n       vessel _a_, and to the gases which are formed in it, and these\r\n       transmit it to the water of the calorimeter.\r\n\r\n  [38] This quantity of heat corresponds with the formation of\r\n       liquid water at the ordinary temperature from detonating gas at\r\n       the same temperature. If the water be as vapour the heat evolved\r\n       = 58 major calories; if as ice = 70·4 major calories. A portion\r\n       of this heat is due to the fact that 2 vols. of hydrogen and 1\r\n       vol. of oxygen give 2 vols. of aqueous vapour--that is to say,\r\n       contraction ensues--and this evolves heat. This quantity of heat\r\n       may be calculated, but it cannot be said how much is expended\r\n       in the separation of the atoms of oxygen from each other, and,\r\n       therefore, strictly speaking, we do not know the quantity of\r\n       heat which is evolved in the reaction alone, although the number\r\n       of units of heat evolved in the combustion of detonating gas is\r\n       accurately known.\r\n\r\n       The construction of the calorimeter and even the method of\r\n       determination vary considerably in different cases. Since the\r\n       beginning of the nineties, a large number of determinations\r\n       of the heat of combustion have been conducted in closed bombs\r\n       containing compressed oxygen. The greatest number of calorimetric\r\n       determinations were made by Berthelot and Thomsen. They are\r\n       given in their works _Essai de mécanique chimique fondée\r\n       sur la thermochimie_, by M. Berthelot, 1879 (2 vols.), and\r\n       _thermochemische Untersuchungen_, by J. Thomsen, 1886 (4 vols.)\r\n       The most important methods of recent thermochemistry, and all\r\n       the trustworthy results of experiment, are given in Prof. P. F.\r\n       Louginin's _Description of the Different Modes of Determining\r\n       the Heat of Combustion of Organic Compounds_, Moscow, 1894.\r\n       The student must refer to works on theoretical and physical\r\n       chemistry for a description of the elements and methods of\r\n       _thermochemistry_, into the details of which it is impossible to\r\n       enter in this work. One of the originators of thermochemistry,\r\n       Hess, was a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.\r\n       Since 1870 a large amount of research has been carried out in\r\n       this province of chemistry, especially in France and Germany,\r\n       after the investigations of the French Academician, Berthelot,\r\n       and Professor Thomsen, of Copenhagen. Among Russians, Beketoff,\r\n       Louginin, Cheltzoff, Chroustchoff, and others are known by their\r\n       thermochemical researches. The present epoch of thermochemistry\r\n       must be considered rather as a collective one, wherein the\r\n       material of facts is amassed, and the first consequences arising\r\n       from them are noticed. In my opinion two essential circumstances\r\n       prevent the possibility of deducing any exact consequences, of\r\n       importance to chemical mechanics, from the immense store of\r\n       thermochemical data already collected: (1) The majority of the\r\n       determinations are conducted in weak aqueous solutions, and, the\r\n       heat of solution being known, are referred to the substances\r\n       in solution; yet there is much (Chapter I.) which leads to the\r\n       conclusion that in solution water does not play the simple\r\n       part of a diluting medium, but of itself acts independently\r\n       in a chemical sense on the substance dissolved. (2) Physical\r\n       and mechanical changes (decrease of volume, diffusion, and\r\n       others) invariably proceed side by side with chemical changes,\r\n       and for the present it is impossible, in a number of cases, to\r\n       distinguish the thermal effect of the one and the other kind of\r\n       change. It is evident that the one kind of change (chemical) is\r\n       essentially inseparable and incomprehensible without the other\r\n       (mechanical and physical); and therefore it seems to me that\r\n       thermochemical data will only acquire their true meaning when\r\n       the connection between the phenomena of both kinds (on the one\r\n       hand chemical and atomic, and on the other hand mechanical and\r\n       molecular or between entire masses) is explained more clearly\r\n       and fully than is at present the case. As there is no doubt that\r\n       the simple mechanical contact, or the action of heat alone,\r\n       on substances sometimes causes an evident and always a latent\r\n       (incipient) chemical change--that is, a different distribution\r\n       or motion of the atoms in the molecules--it follows that purely\r\n       chemical phenomena are inseparable from physical and mechanical\r\n       phenomena. A mechanical change may be imagined without a physical\r\n       change, and a physical without a chemical change, but it is\r\n       impossible to imagine a chemical change without a physical and\r\n       mechanical one, for without the latter we should not be able\r\n       to recognise the former, and it is by their means that we are\r\n       enabled to do so.\r\n\r\n  [39] The flame, or locality where the combustion of gases and vapours\r\n       takes place, is a complex phenomenon, 'an entire factory,' as\r\n       Faraday says, and therefore we will consider flame in some detail\r\n       in one of the following notes.\r\n\r\n  [40] If 34,500 units of heat are evolved in the combustion of 1 part\r\n       of hydrogen, and this heat is transmitted to the resulting 9\r\n       parts by weight of aqueous vapour, then we find that, taking the\r\n       specific heat of the latter as 0·475, each unit of heat raises\r\n       the temperature of 1 part by weight of aqueous vapour 2°·1 and 9\r\n       parts by weight (2·1 ÷ 9) O°·23; hence the 34,500 units of heat\r\n       raise its temperature 7,935°. If detonating gas is converted\r\n       into water in a closed space, then the aqueous vapour formed\r\n       cannot expand, and therefore, in calculating the temperature of\r\n       combustion, the specific heat at a constant volume must be taken\r\n       into consideration; for aqueous vapour it is 0·36. This figure\r\n       gives a still higher temperature for the flame. In reality it\r\n       is much lower, but the results given by different observers are\r\n       very contradictory (from 1,700° to 2,400°), the discrepancies\r\n       depending on the fact that flames of different sizes are cooled\r\n       by radiation to a different degree, but mainly on the fact that\r\n       the methods and apparatus (pyrometers) for the determination\r\n       of high temperatures, although they enable relative changes of\r\n       temperature to be judged, are of little use for determining their\r\n       absolute magnitude. By taking the temperature of the flame of\r\n       detonating gas as 2,000°, I give, I think, the average of the\r\n       most trustworthy determinations and calculations based upon the\r\n       determination of the variation of the specific heat of aqueous\r\n       vapour and other gases (_see_ Chapter XLI.)\r\n\r\n  [41] It is evident that not only hydrogen, but every other combustible\r\n       gas, will give an explosive mixture with oxygen. For this reason\r\n       coal-gas mixed with air explodes when the mixture is ignited.\r\n       The pressure obtained in the explosions serves as the _motive\r\n       power of gas engines_. In this case advantage is taken, not only\r\n       of the pressure produced by the explosion, but also of that\r\n       contraction which takes place after the explosion. On this is\r\n       based the construction of several motors, of which Lenoir's was\r\n       formerly, and Otto's is now, the best known. The explosion is\r\n       usually produced by coal-gas and air, but of late the vapours of\r\n       combustible liquids (kerosene, benzene) are also being employed\r\n       in place of gas (Chapter IX.) In Lenoir's engine a mixture of\r\n       coal-gas and air is ignited by means of sparks from a Ruhmkorff's\r\n       coil, but in the most recent machines the gases are ignited by\r\n       the direct action of a gas jet, or by contact with the hot walls\r\n       of a side tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Safety burner for detonating gas, described in\r\ntext.]\r\n\r\nMixtures of hydrogen and of various other gases with oxygen are taken\r\nadvantage of for obtaining high temperatures. By the aid of such high\r\ntemperatures metals like platinum may be melted on a large scale,\r\nwhich cannot be performed in furnaces heated with charcoal and fed by\r\na current of air. The burner, shown in fig. 34, is constructed for\r\nthe application of detonating gas to the purpose. It consists of two\r\nbrass tubes, one fixed inside the other, as shown in the drawing. The\r\ninternal central tube C C conducts oxygen, and the outside, enveloping,\r\ntube E' E' conducts hydrogen. Previous to their egress the gases\r\ndo not mix together, so that there can be no explosion inside the\r\napparatus. When this burner is in use C is connected with a gas-holder\r\ncontaining oxygen, and E with a gas-holder containing hydrogen (or\r\nsometimes coal-gas). The flow of the gases can be easily regulated by\r\nthe stopcocks O H. The flame is shortest and evolves the greatest heat\r\nwhen the gases burning are in the proportion of 1 volume of oxygen to\r\n2 volumes of hydrogen. The degree of heat may be easily judged from\r\nthe fact that a thin platinum wire placed in the flame of a properly\r\nproportioned mixture easily melts. By placing the burner in the orifice\r\nof a hollow piece of lime, a crucible A B is obtained in which the\r\nplatinum may be easily melted, even in large quantities if the current\r\nof oxygen and hydrogen be sufficiently great (Deville). The flame\r\nof detonating gas may also be used for illuminating purposes. It is\r\nby itself very pale, but owing to its high temperature it may serve\r\nfor rendering infusible objects incandescent, and at the very high\r\ntemperature produced by the detonating gas the incandescent substance\r\ngives a most intense light. For this purpose lime, magnesia, or oxide of\r\nzirconium are used, as they are not fusible at the very high temperature\r\nevolved by the detonating gas. A small cylinder of lime placed in\r\nthe flame of detonating gas, if regulated to the required point,\r\ngives a very brilliant white light, which was at one time proposed\r\nfor illuminating lighthouses. At present in the majority of cases\r\nthe electric light, owing to its constancy and other advantages, has\r\nreplaced it for this purpose. The light produced by the incandescence of\r\nlime in detonating gas is called the _Drummond light_ or _limelight_.\r\n\r\nThe above cases form examples of the combustion of elements in oxygen,\r\nbut exactly similar phenomena are observed in the _combustion of\r\ncompounds_. So, for instance, the solid, colourless, shiny substance,\r\nnaphthalene, C_{10}H_{8}, burns in the air with a smoky flame, whilst\r\nin oxygen it continues to burn with a very brilliant flame. Alcohol,\r\noil, and other substances burn brilliantly in oxygen on conducting the\r\noxygen by a tube to the flame of lamps burning these substances. A high\r\ntemperature is thus evolved, which is sometimes taken advantage of in\r\nchemical practice.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand why combustion in oxygen proceeds more rapidly,\r\nand is accompanied by a more intense heat effect, than combustion in\r\nair, it must be recollected that air is oxygen diluted with nitrogen,\r\nwhich does not support combustion, and therefore fewer particles of\r\noxygen flow to the surface of a substance burning in air than when\r\nburning in pure oxygen, besides which the reason of the intensity of\r\ncombustion in oxygen is the high temperature acquired by the substance\r\nburning in it.[41 bis]\r\n\r\n  [41 bis] Let us consider as an example the combustion of\r\n       sulphur in air and in oxygen. If 1 gram of sulphur burns in air\r\n       or oxygen it evolves in either case 2250 units of heat--_i.e._\r\n       evolves sufficient heat for heating 2,250 grams of water 1°\r\n       C. This heat is first of all transmitted to the sulphurous\r\n       anhydride, SO_{2}, formed by the combination of sulphur with\r\n       oxygen. In its combustion 1 gram of sulphur forms 2 grams of\r\n       sulphurous anhydride--_i.e._ the sulphur combines with 1 gram of\r\n       oxygen. In order that 1 gram of sulphur should have access to 1\r\n       gram of oxygen in air, it is necessary that 3·4 grams of nitrogen\r\n       should simultaneously reach the sulphur, because air contains\r\n       seventy-seven parts of nitrogen (by weight) per twenty-three\r\n       parts of oxygen. Thus in the combustion of 1 gram of sulphur,\r\n       the 2,250 units of heat are transmitted to 2 grams of sulphurous\r\n       oxide and to at least 3·4 grams of nitrogen. As 0·155 unit of\r\n       heat is required to raise 1 gram of sulphurous anhydride 1°\r\n       C., therefore 2 grams require 0·31 unit. So also 3·4 grams of\r\n       nitrogen require 3·4 × 0·244 or 0·83 unit of heat, and therefore\r\n       in order to raise both gases 1° C. 0·31 + 0·83 or 1·14 unit of\r\n       heat is required; but as the combustion of the sulphur evolves\r\n       2,250 units of heat, therefore the gases might be heated (if\r\n       their specific heats remained constant) to 2250/1·14 or 1,974°\r\n       C. That is, the maximum possible temperature of the flame of the\r\n       sulphur burning in air will be 1,974° C. In the combustion of the\r\n       sulphur in oxygen the heat evolved (2,250 units) can only pass to\r\n       the 2 grams of sulphurous anhydride, and therefore the highest\r\n       possible temperature of the flame of the sulphur in oxygen will\r\n       be = 2250/0·31 or 7258°. In the same manner it may be calculated\r\n       that the temperature of charcoal burning in air cannot exceed\r\n       2,700°, while in oxygen it may attain 10,100° C. For this reason\r\n       the temperature in oxygen will always be higher than in air,\r\n       although (judging from what has been said respecting detonating\r\n       gas) neither one temperature nor the other will ever approximate\r\n       to the theoretical amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Faraday's experiment for investigating the\r\ndifferent parts of a candle flame.]\r\n\r\nAmong the phenomena accompanying the combustion of certain substances,\r\nthe _phenomenon of flame_ attracts attention. Sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nsodium, magnesium, naphthalene, &c., burn like hydrogen with a flame,\r\nwhilst in the combustion of other substances no flame is observed, as,\r\nfor instance, in the combustion of iron and of charcoal. The appearance\r\nof flame depends on the capacity of the combustible substance to yield\r\ngases or vapours at the temperature of combustion. At the temperature\r\nof combustion, sulphur, phosphorus, sodium, and naphthalene pass into\r\nvapour, whilst wood, alcohol, oil, &c., are decomposed into gaseous\r\nand vaporous substances. The combustion of gases and vapours forms\r\nflames, and therefore _a flame is composed of the hot and incandescent\r\ngases and vapours produced by combustion_. It may easily be proved that\r\nthe flames of such non-volatile substances as wood contain volatile\r\nand combustible substances formed from them, by placing a tube in the\r\nflame connected with an aspirator. Besides the products of combustion,\r\ncombustible gases and liquids, previously in the flame as vapours,\r\ncollect in the aspirator. For this experiment to succeed--_i.e._ in\r\norder to really extract combustible gases and vapours from the flame\r\nit is necessary that the suction tube should be placed _inside_ the\r\nflame. The combustible gases and vapours can only remain unburnt inside\r\nthe flame, for at the surface of the flame they come into contact with\r\nthe oxygen of the air and burn.[42] Flames are of different degrees\r\nof _brilliancy_, according to whether _solid_ incandescent particles\r\noccur in the combustible gas or vapour, or not. Incandescent gases\r\nand vapours emit but little light by themselves, and therefore give\r\na paler flame.[43] If a flame does not contain solid particles it is\r\ntransparent, pale, and emits but little light.[44] The flames of\r\nburning alcohol, sulphur, and hydrogen are of this kind. A pale flame\r\nmay be rendered luminous by placing fine particles of solid matter in\r\nit. Thus, if a very fine platinum wire be placed in the pale flame\r\nof burning alcohol--or, better still, of hydrogen--the flame emits\r\na bright light. This is still better seen by sifting the powder of\r\nan incombustible substance, such as fine sand, into the flame, or\r\nby placing a bunch of asbestos threads in it. Every brilliant flame\r\nalways contains some kind of solid particles, or at least some very\r\ndense vapour. The flame of sodium burning in oxygen has a brilliant\r\nyellow colour, from the presence of particles of solid sodium oxide.\r\nThe flame of magnesium is brilliant from the fact that in burning\r\nit forms solid magnesia, which becomes white hot, and similarly the\r\nbrilliancy of the Drummond light is due to the heat of the flame\r\nraising the solid non-volatile lime to a state of incandescence.\r\nThe flames of a candle, wood, and similar substances are brilliant,\r\nbecause they contain particles of charcoal or soot. It is not the flame\r\nitself which is luminous, but the incandescent soot it contains. These\r\nparticles of charcoal which occur in flames may be easily observed\r\nby introducing a cold object, like a knife, into the flame.[45] The\r\nparticles of charcoal burn at the outer surface of the flame if the\r\nsupply of air be sufficient, but if the supply of air--that is, of\r\noxygen--be insufficient for their combustion the flame smokes, because\r\nthe unconsumed particles of charcoal are carried off by the current of\r\nair.[46]\r\n\r\n  [42] Faraday proved this by a very convincing experiment on\r\n       a candle flame. If one arm of a bent glass tube be placed in a\r\n       candle flame above the wick in the dark portion of the flame,\r\n       then the products of the partial combustion of the stearin will\r\n       pass up the tube, condense in the other arm, and collect in a\r\n       flask placed under it (fig. 35) as heavy white fumes which burn\r\n       when lighted. If the tube be raised into the upper luminous\r\n       portion of the flame, then a dense black smoke which will not\r\n       inflame accumulates in the flask. Lastly, if the tube be let down\r\n       until it touches the wick, then little but stearic acid condenses\r\n       in the flask.\r\n\r\n  [43] All transparent substances which transmit light with great ease\r\n       (that is, which absorb but little light) are but little luminous\r\n       when heated; so also substances which absorb but few heat rays,\r\n       when heated transmit few rays of heat.\r\n\r\n  [44] There is, however, no doubt but that very heavy dense vapours or\r\n       gases under pressure (according to the experiments of Frankland)\r\n       are luminous when heated, because, as they become denser they\r\n       approach a liquid or solid state. Thus detonating gas when\r\n       exploded under pressure gives a brilliant light.\r\n\r\n  [45] If hydrogen gas be passed through a volatile liquid hydrocarbon--for\r\n       instance, through benzene (the benzene may be poured directly\r\n       into the vessel in which hydrogen is generated)--then its vapour\r\n       burns with the hydrogen and gives a very bright flame, because\r\n       the resultant particles of carbon (soot) become incandescent.\r\n       Benzene, or platinum gauze, introduced into a hydrogen flame may\r\n       be employed for illuminating purposes.\r\n\r\n  [46] In _flames_ the separate parts may be distinguished with more or\r\n       less distinctness. That portion of the flame whither the\r\n       combustible vapours or gases flow, is not luminous because its\r\n       temperature is still too low for the process of combustion to\r\n       take place in it. This is the space which in a candle surrounds\r\n       the wick, or in a gas jet is immediately above the orifice from\r\n       which the gas escapes. In a candle the combustible vapours and\r\n       gases which are formed by the action of heat on the melted\r\n       tallow or stearin rise in the wick, and are heated by the high\r\n       temperature of the flame. By the action of the heat, the solid or\r\n       liquid substance is here, as in other cases, decomposed, forming\r\n       products of dry distillation. These products occur in the central\r\n       portion of the flame of a candle. The air travels to it from the\r\n       outside, and is not able to intermix at once with the vapours\r\n       and gases in all parts of the flame equally; consequently, in\r\n       the outer portion of the flame the amount of oxygen will be\r\n       greater than in the interior portions. But, owing to diffusion,\r\n       the oxygen, of course mixed with nitrogen, flowing towards the\r\n       combustible substance, does finally penetrate to the interior\r\n       of the flame (when the combustion takes place in ordinary air).\r\n       The combustible vapours and gases combine with this oxygen,\r\n       evolve a considerable amount of heat, and bring about that state\r\n       of incandescence which is so necessary both for keeping up the\r\n       combustion and also for the uses to which the flame is applied.\r\n       Passing from the colder envelope of air through the interior\r\n       of the flame, to the source of the combustible vapours (for\r\n       instance, the wick), we evidently first traverse layers of higher\r\n       and higher temperature, and then portions which are less and\r\n       less hot, in which the combustion is less complete, owing to the\r\n       limited supply of oxygen.\r\n\r\n       [Illustrationtion: FIG. 36.--In the candle flame the portion C\r\n       contains the vapours and products of decomposition; in the bright\r\n       zone A the combustion has commenced, and particles of carbon are\r\n       emitted; and in the pale zone B the combustion is completed.]\r\n\r\n       Thus unburnt products of the decomposition of organic substances\r\n       occur in the interior of the flame. But there is always free\r\n       hydrogen in the interior of the flame, even when oxygen is\r\n       introduced there, or when a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen burns,\r\n       because the temperature evolved in the combustion of hydrogen\r\n       or the carbon of organic matter is so high that the products\r\n       of combustion are themselves partially decomposed--that is,\r\n       dissociated--at this temperature. Hence, in a flame a portion\r\n       of the hydrogen and of the oxygen which might combine with\r\n       the combustible substances must always be present in a free\r\n       state. If a hydrocarbon burns, and we imagine that a portion\r\n       of the hydrogen is in a free state, then a portion of the\r\n       carbon must also occur in the same form in the flame, because,\r\n       other conditions being unchanged, carbon burns after hydrogen,\r\n       and this is actually observed in the combustion of various\r\n       hydrocarbons. Charcoal, or the soot of a common flame, arises\r\n       from the dissociation of organic substances contained in the\r\n       flame. The majority of hydrocarbons, especially those containing\r\n       much carbon--for instance, naphthalene--burn, even in oxygen,\r\n       with separation of soot. In that portion of the flame where the\r\n       hydrogen burns the carbon remains unburnt, or at least partly so.\r\n       It is this free carbon which causes the brilliancy of the flame.\r\n       That the interior of the flame contains a mixture which is still\r\n       capable of combustion may be proved by the following experiment:\r\n       A portion of the gases may be withdrawn by an aspirator from\r\n       the central portion of the flame of carbonic oxide, which is\r\n       combustible in air. For this purpose Deville passed water\r\n       through a metallic tube having a fine lateral orifice, which is\r\n       placed in the flame. As the water flows along the tube portions\r\n       of the gases of the flame enter, and, passing along the tube\r\n       alternately with cylinders of water, are carried away into an\r\n       apparatus where they can be investigated. It appears that all\r\n       portions of the flame obtained by the combustion of a mixture\r\n       of carbonic oxide and oxygen contain a portion of this mixture\r\n       still unburnt. The researches of Deville and Bunsen showed that\r\n       in the explosion of a mixture of hydrogen and of carbonic oxide\r\n       with oxygen in a closed space, complete combustion does not ever\r\n       take place immediately. If two volumes of hydrogen and one volume\r\n       of oxygen be confined in a closed space, then on explosion the\r\n       pressure does not attain that magnitude which it would were there\r\n       immediate and complete combustion. It may be calculated that the\r\n       pressure should attain twenty-six atmospheres. In reality, it\r\n       does not exceed nine and a half atmospheres.\r\n\r\n       Hence the admixture of the products of combustion with an\r\n       explosive mixture prevents the combustion of the remaining\r\n       mass, although capable of burning. The admixture of carbonic\r\n       anhydride prevents carbonic oxide from burning. The presence of\r\n       any other foreign gas interferes in the same manner. This shows\r\n       that every portion of a flame must contain combustible, burning,\r\n       and already burnt substances--_i.e._ oxygen, carbon, carbonic\r\n       oxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, carbonic anhydride, and water.\r\n       Consequently, _it is impossible to attain instantaneous complete\r\n       combustion_, and this is one of the reasons of the phenomenon\r\n       of flame. A certain space is required, and the temperature must\r\n       be unequal in different parts of it. In this space different\r\n       quantities of the component parts are successively subjected\r\n       to combustion, or are cooled under the influence of adjacent\r\n       objects, and combustion only ends where the flame ends. If\r\n       the combustion could be concentrated at one spot, then the\r\n       temperature would be incomparably higher than it is under the\r\n       actual circumstances.\r\n\r\n       The various regions of the flame have formed the frequent\r\n       subject of experimental research, and the experiments conducted\r\n       by Smithells and Ingle (1892) are particularly instructive;\r\n       they show that the reducing (interior) and oxidising (exterior)\r\n       portions of the flame of a burning gas may be divided by taking a\r\n       Bunsen burner and surrounding the flame of the gas burnt in it,\r\n       by another wider tube (without the access of air to the annular\r\n       space or allowing only a small current of air to pass), when\r\n       a gaseous mixture, containing oxide of carbon and capable of\r\n       further combustion, will issue from this enveloping tube, so that\r\n       a second flame, corresponding to the exterior (oxidising) portion\r\n       of an ordinary flame, may be obtained above the enveloping tube.\r\n       This division of the flame into two portions is particularly\r\n       clear when cyanogen C_{2}N_{2} is burnt, because the interior\r\n       portion (where CO is chiefly formed according to the equation\r\n       C_{2}N_{2} + O_{2} = 2CO + N_{2}, but a portion of the nitrogen\r\n       is oxidised) is of a rose colour, while the exterior portion\r\n       (where the CO burns into CO_{2} at the expense of a fresh\r\n       quantity of oxygen and of the oxides of nitrogen proceeding from\r\n       the interior portions) is of a bluish-grey colour.\r\n\r\nThe combination of various substances with oxygen may not present\r\nany signs of combustion--that is, the temperature may rise but\r\ninconsiderably. This may either proceed from the fact that the\r\nreaction of the substance (for example, tin, mercury, lead at a\r\nhigh temperature, or a mixture of pyrogallol with caustic potash at\r\nthe ordinary temperature) evolves but little heat, or that the heat\r\nevolved is transmitted to good conductors of heat, like metals, or\r\nthat the combination with oxygen takes place so slowly that the heat\r\nevolved succeeds in passing to the surrounding objects. Combustion\r\nis only a particular, intense, and evident case of combination with\r\noxygen. Respiration is also an act of combination with oxygen; it\r\nalso serves, like combustion, for the development of heat by those\r\nchemical processes which accompany it (the transformation of oxygen into\r\ncarbonic anhydride). Lavoisier enunciated this in the lucid expression,\r\n'respiration is slow combustion.'\r\n\r\nReactions involving slow combination of substances with oxygen are\r\ntermed _oxidations_. Combination of this kind (and also combustion)\r\noften results in the formation of acid substances, and hence the name\r\n_oxygen_ (_Sauerstoff_). Combustion is only rapid oxidation. Phosphorus,\r\niron, and wine may be taken as examples of substances which slowly\r\noxidise in air at the ordinary temperature. If such a substance be\r\nleft in contact with a definite volume of air or oxygen, it absorbs\r\nthe oxygen little by little, as may be seen by the decrease in volume\r\nof the gas. This slow oxidation is not often accompanied by a sensible\r\nevolution of heat; an evolution of heat really does occur, only it\r\nis not apparent to our senses owing to the small rise in temperature\r\nwhich takes place; this is owing to the slow rate of the reaction and\r\nto the transmission of the heat formed as radiant heat, &c. Thus, in\r\nthe oxidation of wine and its transformation into vinegar by the usual\r\nmethod of preparation of the latter, the heat evolved cannot be observed\r\nbecause it extends over several weeks, but in the so-called rapid\r\nprocess of the manufacture of vinegar, when a large quantity of wine is\r\ncomparatively rapidly oxidised, the evolution of heat is quite apparent.\r\n\r\nSuch slow processes of oxidation are always taking place in nature by\r\nthe action of the atmosphere. Dead organisms and the substances obtained\r\nfrom them--such as bodies of animals, wood, wool, grass, &c.--are\r\nespecially subject to this action. They _rot_ and _decompose_--that is,\r\ntheir solid matter is transformed into gases, under the influence of\r\nmoisture and atmospheric oxygen, and generally under the influence of\r\nother organisms, such as moulds, worms, micro-organisms (bacteria), and\r\nthe like. These are processes of slow combustion, of slow combination\r\nwith oxygen. It is well known that manure rots and develops heat,\r\nthat stacks of damp hay, damp flour, straw, &c., become heated and\r\nare changed in the process.[47] In all these transformations the same\r\nchief products of combustion are formed as those which are contained\r\nin smoke; the carbon gives carbonic anhydride, and the hydrogen water.\r\nHence these processes require oxygen just like combustion. This is\r\nthe reason why the entire prevention of access of air hinders these\r\ntransformations,[48] and an increased supply of air accelerates them.\r\nThe mechanical treatment of arable lands by the plough, harrow, and\r\nother similar means has not only the object of facilitating the spread\r\nof roots in the ground, and of making the soil more permeable to water,\r\nbut it also serves to facilitate the access of the air to the component\r\nparts of the soil; as a consequence of which the organic remains of soil\r\nrot--so to speak, breathe air and evolve carbonic anhydride. One acre\r\nof good garden land in the course of a summer evolves more than sixteen\r\ntons of carbonic anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [47] Cotton waste (used in factories for cleaning machines from\r\n       lubricating oil) soaked in oil and lying in heaps is\r\n       self-combustible, being oxidised by the air.\r\n\r\n  [48] When it is desired to preserve a supply of vegetable and animal\r\n       food, the access of the oxygen of the atmosphere (and also of\r\n       the germs of organisms present in the air) is often prevented.\r\n       With this object articles of food are often kept in hermetically\r\n       closed vessels, from which the air has been withdrawn; vegetables\r\n       are dried and soldered up while hot in tin boxes; sardines are\r\n       immersed in oil, &c. The removal of water from substances is also\r\n       sometimes resorted to with the same object (the drying of hay,\r\n       corn, fruits), as also is saturation with substances which absorb\r\n       oxygen (such as sulphurous anhydride), or which hinder the growth\r\n       of organisms forming the first cause of putrefaction, as in\r\n       processes of smoking, embalming, and in the keeping of fishes and\r\n       other animal specimens in spirit, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is not only vegetable and animal substances which are subject to slow\r\noxidation in the presence of water. Some metals even rust under these\r\nconditions. Copper very easily absorbs oxygen in the presence of acids.\r\nMany metallic sulphides (for example, pyrites) are very easily oxidised\r\nwith access of air and moisture. Thus processes of slow oxidation\r\nproceed throughout nature. However, there are many elements which do\r\nnot under any circumstances combine directly with gaseous oxygen;\r\nnevertheless their compounds with oxygen may be obtained. Platinum,\r\ngold, iridium, chlorine, and iodine are examples of such elements. In\r\nthis case recourse is had to a so-called _indirect method_--_i.e._ the\r\ngiven substance is combined with another element, and by a method of\r\ndouble decomposition this element is replaced by oxygen. Substances\r\nwhich do not directly combine with oxygen, but form compounds with it\r\nby an indirect method, often readily lose the oxygen which they had\r\nabsorbed by double decomposition or at the moment of its evolution.\r\nSuch, for example, are the compounds of oxygen with chlorine, nitrogen,\r\nand platinum, which evolve oxygen on heating--that is, they may be\r\nused as oxidising agents. In this respect _oxidising agents_, or those\r\ncompounds of oxygen which are employed in chemical and technical\r\npractice for transferring oxygen to other substances, are especially\r\nremarkable. The most important among these is nitric acid or _aqua\r\nfortis_--a substance rich in oxygen, and capable of evolving it when\r\nheated, which easily oxidises a great number of substances. Thus nearly\r\nall metals and organic substances containing carbon and hydrogen are\r\nmore or less oxidised when heated with nitric acid. If strong nitric\r\nacid be taken, and a piece of burning charcoal be immersed in the acid,\r\nit continues to burn. Chromic acid acts like nitric acid; alcohol burns\r\nwhen mixed with it. Although the action is not so marked, even water\r\nmay oxidise with its oxygen. Sodium is not oxidised in perfectly dry\r\noxygen at the ordinary temperature, but it burns very easily in water\r\nand aqueous vapour. Charcoal can burn in carbonic anhydride--a product\r\nof combustion--forming carbonic oxide. Magnesium burns in the same gas,\r\nseparating carbon from it. Speaking generally, combined oxygen can pass\r\nfrom one compound to another.\r\n\r\nThe products of combustion or oxidation--and in general the definite\r\ncompounds of oxygen--are termed _oxides_. Some oxides are not capable of\r\ncombining with other oxides--or combine with only a few, and then with\r\nthe evolution of very little heat; others, on the contrary, enter into\r\ncombination with very many other oxides, and in general have remarkable\r\nchemical energy. The oxides incapable of combining with others, or only\r\nshowing this quality in a small degree, are termed _indifferent oxides_.\r\nSuch are the peroxides, of which mention has before been made.\r\n\r\nThe class of oxides capable of entering into mutual combination we will\r\nterm _saline oxides_. They fall into two chief groups--at least, as\r\nregards the most extreme members. The members of one group combine with\r\nthe members of the other group with particular ease. As representative\r\nof one group may be taken the oxides of the metals, magnesium, sodium,\r\ncalcium, &c. Representatives of the other group are the oxides formed\r\nby the non-metals, sulphur, phosphorus, carbon. Thus, if we take the\r\noxide of calcium, or lime, and bring it into contact with oxides of the\r\nsecond group, combination very readily ensues. For instance, if we mix\r\ncalcium oxide with oxide of phosphorus they combine with great facility\r\nand with the evolution of much heat. If we pass the vapour of sulphuric\r\nanhydride, obtained by the combination of sulphurous oxide with oxygen,\r\nover pieces of lime heated to redness, the sulphuric anhydride is\r\nabsorbed by the lime with the formation of a substance called calcium\r\nsulphate. The oxides of the first kind, which contain metals, are\r\ntermed _basic oxides_ or _bases_. Lime is a familiar example of this\r\nclass. The oxides of the second group, which are capable of combining\r\nwith the bases, are termed _anhydrides of the acids_ or _acid oxides_.\r\nSulphuric anhydride, SO_{3}, may be taken as a type of the latter group.\r\nIt is a compound of sulphur with oxygen formed not directly but by the\r\naddition of a fresh quantity of oxygen to sulphurous anhydride, SO_{2},\r\nby passing it together with oxygen over incandescent spongy platinum.\r\nCarbonic anhydride (often termed 'carbonic acid'), CO_{2}, phosphoric\r\nanhydride, sulphurous anhydride, are all acid oxides, for they can\r\ncombine with such oxides as lime or calcium oxide, magnesia or magnesium\r\noxide, MgO, soda or sodium oxide, Na_{2}O, &c.\r\n\r\nIf a given element form but one basic oxide, it is termed the _oxide_;\r\nfor example, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, potassium oxide. Some\r\nindifferent oxides are also called 'oxides' if they have not the\r\nproperties of peroxides, and at the same time do not show the properties\r\nof acid anhydrides--for example, carbonic oxide, of which mention\r\nhas already been made. If an element forms two basic oxides (or two\r\nindifferent oxides not having the characteristics of a peroxide) then\r\nthat of the lower degree of oxidation is called a _suboxide_--that is,\r\nsuboxides contain less oxygen than oxides. Thus, when copper is heated\r\nto redness in a furnace it increases in weight and absorbs oxygen,\r\nuntil for 63 parts of copper there is absorbed not more than 8 parts\r\nof oxygen by weight, forming a red mass, which is suboxide of copper;\r\nbut if the roasting be prolonged, and the draught of air increased,\r\n63 parts of copper absorb 16 parts of oxygen, and form black oxide of\r\ncopper. Sometimes to distinguish between the degrees of oxidation a\r\nchange of suffix is made in the oxidised element, _-ic_ oxide denoting\r\nthe higher degree of oxidation, and _-ous_ oxide the lower degree.\r\nThus ferrous oxide and ferric oxide are the same as suboxide of iron\r\nand oxide of iron. If an element forms one anhydride only, then it is\r\nnamed by an adjective formed from the name of the element made to end in\r\n_-ic_ and the word _anhydride_. When an element forms two anhydrides,\r\nthen the suffixes _-ous_ and _-ic_ are used to distinguish them: _-ous_\r\nsignifying less oxygen than _-ic_; for example, sulphurous and sulphuric\r\nanhydrides.[49] When several oxides are formed from the same element,\r\nthe prefixes _mon_, _di_, _tri_, _tetra_ are used, thus: chlorine\r\nmonoxide, chlorine dioxide, chlorine trioxide, and chlorine tetroxide\r\nor chloric anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [49] It must be remarked that certain elements form oxides of all three\r\n       kinds--_i.e._ indifferent, basic, and acid; for example,\r\n       manganese forms manganous oxide, manganic oxide, peroxide of\r\n       manganese, red oxide of manganese, and manganic anhydride,\r\n       although some of them are not known in a free state but only\r\n       in combination. The basic oxides contain less oxygen than the\r\n       peroxides, and the peroxides less than the acid anhydrides.\r\n       Thus they must be placed in the following general normal\r\n       order with respect to the amount of oxygen entering into\r\n       their composition--(1) basic oxides, suboxides, and oxides;\r\n       (2) peroxides; (3) acid anhydrides. The majority of elements,\r\n       however, do not give all three kinds of oxides, some giving only\r\n       one degree of oxidation. It must further be remarked that there\r\n       are oxides formed by the combination of acid anhydrides with\r\n       basic oxides, or, in general, of oxides with oxides. For every\r\n       oxide having a higher and a lower degree of oxidation, it might\r\n       be said that the intermediate oxide was formed by the combination\r\n       of the higher with the lower oxide. But this is not true in all\r\n       cases--for instance, when the oxide under consideration forms\r\n       a whole series of independent compounds--for oxides which are\r\n       really formed by the combination of two other oxides do not give\r\n       such independent compounds, but in many cases decompose into the\r\n       higher and lower oxides.\r\n\r\nThe oxides themselves rarely undergo chemical transformations, and in\r\nthe few cases where they are subject to such changes a particularly\r\nimportant part is played by their combinations with water. The majority\r\nof, if not all, basic and acid oxides combine with water, either by a\r\ndirect or an indirect method forming _hydrates_--that is, compounds\r\nwhich split up into water and an oxide of the same kind only. It is\r\nwell known that many substances are capable of combining with water.\r\nOxides possess this property in the highest degree. We have already\r\nseen examples of this (Chapter I.) in the combination of lime, and\r\nof sulphuric and phosphoric anhydrides, with water. The resulting\r\ncombinations are basic and acid hydrates. Acid hydrates are called\r\n_acids_ because they have an acid taste when dissolved in water (or\r\nsaliva), for then only can they act on the palate. Vinegar, for example,\r\nhas an acid taste because it contains acetic acid dissolved in water.\r\nSulphuric acid, to which we have frequently referred, because it is the\r\nacid of the greatest importance both in practical chemistry and for its\r\ntechnical applications, is really a hydrate formed by the combination\r\nof sulphuric anhydride with water. Besides their acid taste, dissolved\r\nacids or acid hydrates have the property of changing the blue colour of\r\ncertain vegetable dyes to red. Of these dyes _litmus_ is particularly\r\nremarkable and much used. It is the blue substance extracted from\r\ncertain lichens, and is used for dyeing tissues blue; it gives a blue\r\ninfusion with water. This infusion, on the addition of an acid, _changes\r\nfrom blue to red_.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Blotting or unsized paper, soaked in a solution of litmus, is\r\n       usually employed for detecting the presence of acids. This paper\r\n       is cut into strips, and is called _test paper_; when dipped into\r\n       acid it immediately turns red. This is a most sensitive reaction,\r\n       and may be employed for testing for the smallest traces of\r\n       acids. If 10,000 parts by weight of water be mixed with 1 part\r\n       of sulphuric acid, the coloration is distinct, and it is even\r\n       perceptible on the addition of ten times more water. Certain\r\n       precautions must, however, be taken in the preparation of such\r\n       very sensitive litmus paper. Litmus is sold in lumps. Take, say,\r\n       100 grams of it; powder it, and add it to cold pure water in\r\n       a flask; shake and decant the water. Repeat this three times.\r\n       This is done to wash away easily-soluble impurities, especially\r\n       alkalis. Transfer the washed litmus (it is washed with absolute\r\n       alcohol to remove the non-sensitive reddish colouring matter) to\r\n       a flask, and pour in 600 c.c. of water, heat, and allow the hot\r\n       infusion to remain for some hours in a warm place. Then filter,\r\n       and divide the filtrate into two parts. Add a few drops of nitric\r\n       acid to one portion, so that a faint red tinge is obtained, and\r\n       then mix the two portions. Add spirit to the mixture, and keep\r\n       it in a stoppered bottle (it soon spoils if left open to the\r\n       air). This infusion may be employed directly; it reddens in the\r\n       presence of acids, and turns blue in the presence of alkalis. If\r\n       evaporated, a solid mass is obtained which is soluble in water,\r\n       and may be kept unchanged for any length of time. The test paper\r\n       may be prepared as follows:--Take a strong infusion of litmus,\r\n       and soak blotting-paper with it; dry it, and cut it into strips,\r\n       and use it as test-paper for acids. For the detection of alkalis,\r\n       the paper must be soaked in a solution of litmus just reddened by\r\n       a few drops of acid; if too much acid be taken, the paper will\r\n       not be sensitive. Such acids as sulphuric acid colour litmus,\r\n       and especially its infusion, a brick-red colour, whilst more\r\n       feeble acids, such as carbonic, give a faint red-wine tinge.\r\n       Test-paper of a yellow colour is also employed; it is dyed by\r\n       an infusion of turmeric roots in spirit. In alkalis it turns\r\n       brown, but regains its original hue in acids. Many blue and other\r\n       vegetable colouring matters may be used for the detection of\r\n       acids and alkalis; for example, infusions of cochineal, violets,\r\n       log-wood, &c. Certain artificially prepared substances and dyes\r\n       may also be employed. Thus rosolic acid, C_{20}H_{16}O_{3} and\r\n       phenolphthaleïn, C_{20}H_{14}O_{4} (it is used in an alcoholic\r\n       solution, and is not suitable for the detection of ammonia), are\r\n       colourless in an acid, and red in an alkaline, solution. Cyanine\r\n       is also colourless in the presence of acids, and gives a blue\r\n       coloration with alkalis. Methyl-orange (yellow in an aqueous\r\n       solution) is not altered by alkalis but becomes pink with acids\r\n       (weak acids have no action), &c. These are very sensitive tests.\r\n       Their behaviour in respect to various acids, alkalis, and salts\r\n       sometimes give the means of distinguishing substances from each\r\n       other.\r\n\r\nBasic oxides, in combining with water, form hydrates, of which, however,\r\nvery few are soluble in water. Those which are soluble in water have\r\nan alkaline taste like that of soap or of water in which wood ashes\r\nhave been boiled, and are called _alkalis_. Further, alkalis have the\r\nproperty of restoring the blue colour to litmus which has been reddened\r\nby the action of acids. The hydrates of the oxides of sodium and\r\npotassium, NaHO and KHO, are examples of basic hydrates easily soluble\r\nin water. They are true alkalis, and are termed _caustic_, because they\r\nact very powerfully on the skin of animals and plants. Thus NaHO is\r\ncalled 'caustic' soda.\r\n\r\nThe saline oxides are capable of combining together and with water.\r\nWater itself is an oxide, and not an indifferent one, for it can, as we\r\nhave seen, combine with basic and acid oxides; it is a representative\r\nof a whole series of saline oxides, _intermediate oxides_, capable of\r\ncombining with both basic and acid oxides. There are many such oxides,\r\nwhich, like water, combine with basic and acid anhydrides--for instance,\r\nthe oxides of aluminium and tin, &c. From this it may be concluded that\r\nall oxides might be placed, in respect to their capacity for combining\r\nwith one another, in one uninterrupted series, at one extremity of which\r\nwould stand those oxides which do not combine with the bases--that\r\nis, the alkalis--while at the other end would be the acid oxides, and\r\nin the interval those oxides which combine with one another and with\r\nboth the acid and basic oxides. The further apart the members of this\r\nseries are, the more stable are the compounds they form together, the\r\nmore energetically do they act on each other, the greater the quantity\r\nof heat evolved in their reaction, and the more marked is their saline\r\nchemical character.\r\n\r\nWe said above that basic and acid oxides combine together, but rarely\r\nreact on each other; this depends on the fact that the majority of them\r\nare solids or gases--that is, they occur in the state least prone\r\nto chemical reaction. The gaseo-elastic state is with difficulty\r\ndestroyed, because it necessitates overcoming the elasticity proper\r\nto the gaseous particles. The solid state is characterised by the\r\nimmobility of its particles; whilst chemical action requires contact,\r\nand hence a displacement and mobility. If solid oxides be heated, and\r\nespecially if they be melted, then reaction proceeds with great ease.\r\nBut such a change of state rarely occurs in nature or in practice.\r\nOnly in a few furnace processes is this the case. For example; in the\r\nmanufacture of glass, the oxides contained in it combine together in\r\na molten state. But when oxides combine with water, and especially\r\nwhen they form hydrates soluble in water, then the mobility of their\r\nparticles increases to a considerable extent, and their reaction\r\nis greatly facilitated. Reaction then takes place at the ordinary\r\ntemperature--easily and rapidly; so that this kind of reaction belongs\r\nto the class of those which take place with unusual facility, and are,\r\ntherefore, very often taken advantage of in practice, and also have\r\nbeen and are going on in nature at every step. We will now consider the\r\nreactions of oxides in the state of hydrates, not losing sight of the\r\nfact that water is itself an oxide with definite properties, and has,\r\ntherefore, no little influence on the course of those changes in which\r\nit takes part.\r\n\r\nIf we take a definite quantity of an acid, and add an infusion of litmus\r\nto it, it turns red; the addition of an alkaline solution does not\r\nimmediately alter the red colour of the litmus, but on adding more and\r\nmore of the alkaline solution a point is reached when the red colour\r\nchanges to violet, and then the further addition of a fresh quantity\r\nof the alkaline solution changes the colour to blue. This change of\r\nthe colour of the litmus is a consequence of the formation of a new\r\ncompound. This reaction is termed the _saturation_ or _neutralisation_\r\nof the acid by the base, or _vice versâ_. The solution in which the acid\r\nproperties of the acid are saturated by the alkaline properties of the\r\nbase is termed a _neutral_ solution. Such a solution, although derived\r\nfrom the mixture of a base with an acid, does not exhibit either the\r\nacid or basic reaction on litmus, yet it preserves many other signs of\r\nthe acid and alkali. It is observed that in such a definite admixture\r\nof an acid with an alkali, besides the changes in the colour of litmus\r\nthere is a heating effect--_i.e._ an evolution of heat--which is alone\r\nsufficient to prove that there was chemical action. And, indeed, if the\r\nresultant violet solution be evaporated, there separates out, not the\r\nacid or the alkali originally taken, but a substance which has neither\r\nacid nor alkaline properties, but is usually solid and crystalline,\r\nhaving a saline appearance; this is a _salt_ in the chemical sense of\r\nthe word. Hence a salt is derived from the reaction of an acid on an\r\nalkali, in a certain definite proportion. The water here taken for\r\nsolution plays no other part than merely facilitating the progress\r\nof the reaction. This is seen from the fact that the anhydrides of\r\nthe acids are able to combine with basic oxides, and give the same\r\nsalts as do the acids with the alkalis or hydrates. Hence, a salt is a\r\ncompound of definite quantities of an acid with an alkali. In the latter\r\nreaction, water is separated out if the substance formed be the same\r\nas is produced by the combination of anhydrous oxides together.[51]\r\nExamples of the formation of salts from acids and bases are easily\r\nobserved, and are very often applied in practice. If we take, for\r\ninstance, insoluble magnesium oxide (magnesia) it is easily dissolved\r\nin sulphuric acid, and on evaporation gives a saline substance, bitter,\r\nlike all the salts of magnesium, and familiar to all under the name of\r\nEpsom salts, used as a purgative. If a solution of caustic soda--which\r\nis obtained, as we saw, by the action of water on sodium oxide--be\r\npoured into a flask in which charcoal has been burnt; or if carbonic\r\nanhydride, which is produced under so many circumstances, be passed\r\nthrough a solution of caustic soda, then sodium carbonate or soda,\r\nNa_{2}CO_{3}, is obtained, of which we have spoken several times, and\r\nwhich is prepared on a large scale and often used in manufactures. This\r\nreaction is expressed by the equation, 2NaHO + CO_{2} = Na_{2}CO_{3} +\r\nH_{2}O. Thus, the various bases and acids form an innumerable number of\r\ndifferent salts.[52] Salts constitute an example of definite chemical\r\ncompounds, and both in the history and practice of science are most\r\noften cited as confirming the conception of definite chemical compounds.\r\nIndeed, all the indications of a definite chemical combination are\r\nclearly seen in the formation and properties of salts. Thus, they are\r\nproduced with a definite proportion of oxides, heat is evolved in their\r\nformation,[53] and the chemical character of the oxides and many of the\r\nphysical properties become hidden in their salts. For example, when\r\ngaseous carbonic anhydride combines with a base to form a solid salt,\r\nthe elasticity of the gas quite disappears in its passage into the\r\nsalt.[54]\r\n\r\n  [51] That water really is separated in the reaction of acid on alkaline\r\n       hydrates, may be shown by taking some other intermediate\r\n       hydrate--for example, alumina--instead of water. Thus, if a\r\n       solution of alumina in sulphuric acid be taken, it will have,\r\n       like the acid, an acid reaction, and will therefore colour\r\n       litmus red. If, on the other hand, a solution of alumina in an\r\n       alkali--say, potash--be taken, it will have an alkaline reaction,\r\n       and will turn red litmus blue. On adding the alkaline to the\r\n       acid solution until neither an alkaline nor an acid reaction is\r\n       produced, a salt is formed, consisting of sulphuric anhydride\r\n       and potassium oxide. In this, as in the reaction of hydrates,\r\n       an intermediate oxide is separated out--namely, alumina. Its\r\n       separation will be very evident in this case, as alumina is\r\n       insoluble in water.\r\n\r\n  [52] The mutual interaction of hydrates, and their capacity of forming\r\n       salts, may be taken advantage of for determining the character\r\n       of those hydrates which are insoluble in water. Let us imagine\r\n       that a given hydrate, whose chemical character is unknown, is\r\n       insoluble in water. It is therefore impossible to test its\r\n       reaction on litmus. It is then mixed with water, and an acid--for\r\n       instance, sulphuric acid--is added to the mixture. If the hydrate\r\n       taken be basic, reaction will take place, either directly or by\r\n       the aid of heat, with the formation of a salt. In certain cases,\r\n       the resultant salt is soluble in water, and this will at once\r\n       show that combination has taken place between the insoluble basic\r\n       hydrate and the acid, with the formation of a soluble saline\r\n       substance. In those cases where the resultant salt is insoluble,\r\n       still the water loses its acid reaction, and therefore it may he\r\n       ascertained, by the addition of an acid, whether a given hydrate\r\n       has a basic character, like the hydrates of oxide of copper,\r\n       lead, &c. If the acid does not act on the given insoluble hydrate\r\n       (at any temperature), then it has not a basic character, and it\r\n       should be tested as to whether it has an acid character. This is\r\n       done by taking an alkali, instead of the acid, and by observing\r\n       whether the unknown hydrate then dissolves, or whether the\r\n       alkaline reaction disappears. Thus it may he proved that hydrate\r\n       of silica is acid, because it dissolves in alkalis and not in\r\n       acids. If it be a case of an insoluble intermediate hydrate, then\r\n       it will be observed to react on both the acid and alkali. Hydrate\r\n       of alumina is an instance in question, which is soluble both in\r\n       caustic potash and in sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n       The _degree of affinity_ or chemical _energy_ proper to oxides\r\n       and their hydrates is very dissimilar; some extreme members\r\n       of the series possess it to a great extent. When acting on\r\n       each other they evolve a large quantity of heat, and when\r\n       acting on intermediate hydrates they also evolve heat to a\r\n       considerable degree, as we saw in the combination of lime and\r\n       sulphuric anhydride with water. When extreme oxides combine\r\n       they form stable salts, which are decomposed with difficulty,\r\n       and often show characteristic properties. The compounds of the\r\n       intermediate oxides with each other, or even with basic and acid\r\n       oxides, present a very different case. However much alumina we\r\n       may dissolve in sulphuric acid, we cannot saturate the acid\r\n       properties of the sulphuric acid, the resulting solution will\r\n       always have an acid reaction. So also, whatever quantity of\r\n       alumina is dissolved in an alkali, the resulting solution will\r\n       always present an alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\n  [53] In order to give an idea of the quantity of heat evolved in the\r\n       formation of salts I append a table of data for _very dilute\r\n       aqueous solutions_ of acids and alkalis, according to the\r\n       determinations of Berthelot and Thomsen. The figures are given\r\n       in major calories--that is, in thousands of units of heat. For\r\n       example, 49 grams of sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, taken in a\r\n       dilute aqueous solution, when mixed with such an amount of a weak\r\n       solution of caustic soda, NaHO, that a neutral salt is formed\r\n       (when all the hydrogen of the acid is replaced by the sodium),\r\n       evolves 15,800 units of heat.\r\n\r\n                              49 parts of      63 parts of\r\n                              H_{2}SO_{4}        HNO_{3}\r\n\r\n                   NaHO           15·8            13·7\r\n                   KHO            15·7            13·8\r\n                   NH_{3}         14·5            12·5\r\n                   CaO            15·6            13·9\r\n                   BaO            18·4            13·9\r\n                   MgO            15·6            13·8\r\n                   FeO            12·5            10·7 (?)\r\n                   ZnO            11·7             9·8\r\n                   Fe_{2}O_{3}     5·7             5·9\r\n\r\n       These figures cannot be considered as the heat of neutralisation,\r\n       because the water here plays an important part. Thus, for\r\n       instance, sulphuric acid and caustic soda in dissolving in water\r\n       evolve very much heat, and the resultant sodium sulphate very\r\n       little; consequently, the amount of heat evolved in an anhydrous\r\n       combination will be different from that evolved in a hydrated\r\n       combination. Those acids which are not energetic in combining\r\n       with the same quantity of alkalis required for the formation of\r\n       normal salts of sulphuric or nitric acids always, however, give\r\n       less heat. For instance, with caustic soda: carbonic acid gives\r\n       10·2, hydrocyanic, 2·9, hydrogen sulphide, 3·9 major calories.\r\n       And as feeble bases (for example, Fe_{2}O_{3}) also evolve less\r\n       heat than those which are more powerful, so a certain general\r\n       correlation between thermochemical data and the degree of\r\n       affinity shows itself here, as in other cases (_see_ Chapter II.,\r\n       Note 7); this does not, however, give any reason for measuring\r\n       the affinity which binds the elements of salts by the heat\r\n       of their formation in dilute solutions. This is very clearly\r\n       demonstrated by the fact that water is able to decompose many\r\n       salts, and is separated in their formation.\r\n\r\n  [54] Carbonic anhydride evolves heat in dissolving in water. The\r\n       solution easily dissociates and evolves carbonic anhydride,\r\n       according to the law of Henry and Dalton (_see_ Chapter I.)\r\n       In dissolving in caustic soda, it either gives a normal salt,\r\n       Na_{2}CO_{3}, which does not evolve carbonic anhydride, or an\r\n       acid salt, NaHCO_{3} which easily evolves carbonic anhydride when\r\n       heated. The same gas, when dissolved in solutions of salts, acts\r\n       in one or the other manner (_see_ Chapter II., Note 38). Here\r\n       it is seen what a successive series of relations exists between\r\n       compounds of a different order, between substances of different\r\n       degrees of stability. By making a distinction between the\r\n       phenomena of solutions and chemical compounds, we overlook those\r\n       natural transitions which in reality exist.\r\n\r\nJudging from the above, a salt is a compound of basic and acid oxides,\r\nor the result of the action of hydrates of these classes on each other\r\nwith separation of water. But salts may be obtained by other methods. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that basic oxides are formed by metals, and acid\r\noxides usually by non-metals. But metals and non-metals are capable of\r\ncombining together, and a salt is frequently formed by the oxidation of\r\nsuch a compound. For example, iron very easily combines with sulphur,\r\nforming iron sulphide FeS (as we saw in the Introduction); this in\r\nair, and especially moist air, absorbs oxygen, with the formation of\r\nthe same salt FeSO_{4}, that may be obtained by the combination of the\r\noxides of iron and sulphur, or of the hydrates of these oxides. Hence,\r\nit cannot be said or supposed that a salt has the properties of the\r\noxides, or must necessarily contain two kinds of oxides in itself.\r\nThe derivation of salts from oxides is merely one of the methods of\r\ntheir preparation. We saw, for instance, that in sulphuric acid it was\r\npossible to replace the hydrogen by zinc, and that by this means zinc\r\nsulphate was formed; so likewise the hydrogen in many other acids may be\r\nreplaced by zinc, iron, potassium, sodium, and a whole series of similar\r\nmetals, corresponding salts being obtained. The hydrogen of the acid,\r\nin all these cases, is exchanged for a metal, and a salt is obtained\r\nfrom the hydrate. Regarding a salt from this point of view, it may be\r\nsaid that _a salt is an acid in which hydrogen is replaced by a metal_.\r\nThis definition shows that a salt and an acid are essentially compounds\r\nof the same series, with the difference that the latter contains\r\nhydrogen and the former a metal. Such a definition is more exact than\r\nthe first definition of salts, inasmuch as it likewise includes those\r\nacids which do not contain oxygen, and, as we shall afterwards learn,\r\nthere is a series of such acids. Such elements as chlorine and bromine\r\nform compounds with hydrogen in which the hydrogen may be replaced by\r\na metal, forming substances which, in their reactions and external\r\ncharacters, resemble the salts formed from oxides. Table salt, NaCl, is\r\nan example of this. It may be obtained by the replacement of hydrogen\r\nin hydrochloric acid, HCl, by the metal sodium, just as sulphate of\r\nsodium, Na_{2}SO_{4}, may be obtained by the replacement of hydrogen in\r\nsulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, by sodium. The exterior appearance of the\r\nresulting products, their neutral reaction, and even their saline taste,\r\nshow their resemblance to one another.\r\n\r\nTo the fundamental properties of salts yet another must be\r\nadded--namely, that they are more or less _decomposed by the action of a\r\ngalvanic current_. The results of this decomposition are very different\r\naccording to whether the salt be taken in a fused or dissolved state.\r\nBut the decomposition may generally be so represented, that the metal\r\nappears at the electro-negative pole or cathode (like hydrogen in the\r\ndecomposition of water, or its mixture with sulphuric acid), and the\r\nremaining parts of the salt appear at the electro-positive pole or anode\r\n(where the oxygen of water appears). If, for instance, an electric\r\ncurrent acts on an aqueous solution of sodium sulphate, then the sodium\r\nappears at the negative pole, and oxygen and the anhydride of sulphuric\r\nacid at the positive pole. But in the solution itself the result is\r\ndifferent, for sodium, as we know, decomposes water with evolution of\r\nhydrogen, forming caustic soda; consequently hydrogen will be evolved,\r\nand caustic soda appear at the negative pole: while at the positive\r\npole the sulphuric anhydride immediately combines with water and forms\r\nsulphuric acid, and therefore oxygen will be evolved and sulphuric acid\r\nformed round this pole.[55] In other cases, when the metal separated is\r\nnot able to decompose water, it will be deposited in a free state. Thus,\r\nfor example, in the decomposition of copper sulphate, copper separates\r\nout at the cathode, and oxygen and sulphuric acid appear at the anode,\r\nand if a copper plate be attached to the positive pole, then the oxygen\r\nevolved will oxidise the copper, and the oxide of copper will dissolve\r\nand be deposited at the negative pole--that is, a transfer of copper\r\nfrom the positive to the negative pole ensues. The galvanoplastic art\r\n(electro-typing) is based on this principle.[56] Therefore the most\r\nradical and general properties of salts (including also such salts as\r\ntable salt, which contain no oxygen) may be expressed by representing\r\nthe salt as composed of a metal M and a haloid X--that is, by expressing\r\nthe salt by MX. In common table salt the metal is sodium, and the haloid\r\nan elementary body, chlorine. In sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, sodium\r\nis again the metal, but the complex group, SO_{4}, is the haloid. In\r\nsulphate of copper, CuSO_{4}, the metal is copper and the haloid the\r\nsame as in the preceding salt. Such a representation of salts expresses\r\nwith great simplicity the _capacity of every salt to enter into saline\r\ndouble decompositions with other salts_; consisting in the mutual\r\nreplacement of the metals in the salts. This exchange of their metals\r\nis the fundamental property of salts. In the case of two salts with\r\ndifferent metals and haloids, which are in solution or fusion, or in\r\nany other manner brought into contact, the metals of these salts will\r\nalways partially or wholly exchange places. If we designate one salt\r\nby MX, and the other by NY, then we either partially or wholly obtain\r\nfrom them new salts, MY and NX. Thus we saw in the Introduction, that\r\non mixing solutions of table salt, NaCl, and silver nitrate, AgNO_{3},\r\na white insoluble precipitate of silver chloride, AgCl, is formed and\r\na new salt, sodium nitrate, NaNO_{3}, is obtained in solution. If the\r\nmetals of salts exchange places in reactions of double decomposition,\r\nit is clear that metals themselves, taken in a separate state, are\r\nable to act on salts, as zinc evolves hydrogen from acids, and as iron\r\nseparates copper from copper sulphate. When, to what extent, and which\r\nmetals displace each other, and how the metals are distributed between\r\nthe haloids, will be discussed in Chapter X., where we shall be guided\r\nby those reflections and deductions which Berthollet introduced into the\r\nscience at the beginning of this century.\r\n\r\n  [55] This kind of decomposition may be easily observed by pouring\r\n       a solution of sodium sulphate into a U-shaped tube and\r\n       inserting electrodes in the two branches. If the solution be\r\n       coloured with an infusion of litmus, it will easily be seen\r\n       that it turns blue at the cathode, owing to the formation of\r\n       sodium hydroxide, and red at the electro-positive pole, from the\r\n       formation of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n  [56] In other cases the decomposition of salts by the electric current\r\n       may be accompanied by much more complex results. Thus, when the\r\n       metal of the salt is capable of a higher degree of oxidation,\r\n       such a higher oxide may be formed at the positive pole by the\r\n       oxygen which is evolved there. This takes place, for instance,\r\n       in the decomposition of salts of silver and manganese by the\r\n       galvanic current, peroxides of these metals being formed. Thus in\r\n       the electrolysis of a solution of KCl, KClO_{3} is formed, and\r\n       of sulphuric acid (corresponding to SO_{3}) persulphuric acid,\r\n       corresponding to S_{2}O_{7}. But all the phenomena as yet known\r\n       may be expressed by the above law--that the current decomposes\r\n       salts into metals, which appear at the negative pole, and into\r\n       the remaining component parts, which appear at the positive pole.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above observations, an acid is nothing more than a\r\nsalt of hydrogen. Water itself may be looked on as a salt in which\r\nthe hydrogen is combined with either oxygen or the aqueous radicle,\r\nOH; water will then be HOH, and alkalis or basic hydrates, MOH. The\r\ngroup OH, or the _aqueous radicle_, otherwise called _hydroxyl_, may\r\nbe looked on as a haloid like the chlorine in table salt, not only\r\nbecause the element Cl and the group OH very often change places, and\r\ncombine with one and the same element, but also because free chlorine is\r\nvery similar in many properties and reactions to peroxide of hydrogen,\r\nwhich is the same in composition as the aqueous radicle, as we shall\r\nafterwards see in Chapter IV. Alkalis and basic hydrates are also\r\nsalts consisting of a metal and hydroxyl--for instance, caustic soda,\r\nNaOH; this is therefore termed _sodium hydroxide_. According to this\r\nview, _acid salts_ are those in which a portion only of the hydrogen is\r\nreplaced by a metal, and a portion of the hydrogen of the acid remains.\r\nThus sulphuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}) not only gives the normal salt\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}, with sodium, but also an acid salt, NaHSO_{4}. A _basic\r\nsalt_ is one in which the metal is combined not only with the haloids\r\nof acids, but also with the aqueous radicale of basic hydrates--for\r\nexample, bismuth gives not only a normal salt of nitric acid,\r\nBi(NO_{3})_{3}, but also basic salts like Bi(OH)_{2}(NO_{3}).\r\n\r\nAs basic and acid salts of the oxygen acids contain hydrogen and oxygen,\r\nthey are able to part with these as water and to give anhydro-salts,\r\nwhich it is evident will be compounds of normal salts with anhydrides\r\nof the acids or with bases. Thus the above-mentioned acid sodium\r\nsulphate corresponds with the anhydro-salt, Na_{2}S_{2}O_{7}, equal\r\nto 2NaHSO_{4}, less H_{2}O. The loss of water is here, and frequently\r\nin other cases, brought about by heat alone, and therefore such salts\r\nare frequently termed _pyro-salts_--for instance, the preceding is\r\nsodium pyrosulphate (Na_{2}S_{2}O_{7}), or it may be regarded as the\r\nnormal salt Na_{2}SO_{4} + sulphuric anhydride, SO_{3}. _Double_ salts\r\nare those which contain either two metals, KAl(SO_{4})_{2}, or two\r\nhaloids.[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] The above-enunciated generalisation of the conception of salts as\r\n       compounds of the metals (simple, or compound like ammonium,\r\n       NH_{4}), with the haloids (simple, like chlorine, or compound,\r\n       like cyanogen, CN, or the radical of sulphuric acid, SO_{4}),\r\n       capable of entering into double saline decomposition, which\r\n       is in accordance with the general data respecting salts, was\r\n       only formed little by little after a succession of most varied\r\n       propositions as to the chemical structure of salts.\r\n\r\n       Salts belong to the class of substances which have been known\r\n       since very early times, and have long been investigated in many\r\n       directions. At first, however, no distinction was made between\r\n       salts, acids, and bases. Glauber prepared many artificial salts\r\n       during the latter half of the seventeenth century. Up to that\r\n       time the majority of salts were obtained from natural sources,\r\n       and that salt which we have referred to several times--namely,\r\n       sodium sulphate--was named Glauber's salt after this chemist.\r\n       Rouelle distinguished normal, acid, and basic salts, and showed\r\n       their action on vegetable dyes, still he confounded many salts\r\n       with acids (even now every acid salt ought to be regarded as an\r\n       acid, because it contains hydrogen, which may be replaced by\r\n       metals--that is, it is the hydrogen of an acid). Baumé disputed\r\n       Rouelle's opinion concerning the subdivision of salts, contending\r\n       that normal salts only are true salts, and that basic salts are\r\n       simple mixtures of normal salts with bases and acid salts with\r\n       acids, considering that washing alone could remove the base or\r\n       acid from them. Rouelle, in the middle of the last century,\r\n       however, rendered a great service to the study of salts and the\r\n       diffusion of knowledge respecting this class of compounds in\r\n       his attractive lectures. He, like the majority of the chemists\r\n       of that period, did not employ the balance in his researches,\r\n       but satisfied himself with purely qualitative data. The first\r\n       quantitative researches on salts were carried on about this\r\n       time by Wenzel, who was the director of the Freiburg mines, in\r\n       Saxony. Wenzel studied the double decomposition of salts, and\r\n       observed that in the double decomposition of neutral salts a\r\n       neutral salt was always obtained. He proved, by a method of\r\n       weighing, that this is due to the fact that the saturation of a\r\n       given quantity of a base requires such relative quantities of\r\n       different acids as are capable of saturating every other base.\r\n       Having taken two neutral salts--for example, sodium sulphate and\r\n       calcium nitrate--let us mix their solutions together. Double\r\n       decomposition takes place, because calcium sulphate is formed,\r\n       which is almost insoluble. However much we might add of each\r\n       of the salts, the neutral reaction will still be preserved,\r\n       consequently the neutral character of the salts is not destroyed\r\n       by the interchange of metals; that is to say, that quantity of\r\n       sulphuric acid which saturated the sodium is sufficient for the\r\n       saturation of the calcium, and that amount of nitric acid which\r\n       saturated the calcium is enough to saturate the sodium contained\r\n       in combination with sulphuric acid in sodium sulphate. Wenzel\r\n       was even convinced that matter does not disappear in nature, and\r\n       on this principle he corrects, in his _Doctrine of Affinity_,\r\n       the results of his experiments when he found that he obtained\r\n       less than he had originally taken. Although Wenzel deduced the\r\n       law of the double decomposition of salts quite correctly, he did\r\n       not determine those quantities in which acids and bases act on\r\n       each other. This was carried out at the end of the last century\r\n       by Richter. He determined the quantities by weight of the bases\r\n       which saturate acids and of the acids which saturate bases, and\r\n       obtained comparatively correct results, although his conclusions\r\n       were not correct, for he states that the quantity of a base\r\n       saturating a given acid varies in arithmetical progression, and\r\n       the quantity of an acid saturating a given base in geometrical\r\n       progression. Richter studied the deposition of metals from their\r\n       salts by other metals, and observed that the neutral reaction\r\n       of the solution is not destroyed by this exchange. He also\r\n       determined the quantities by weight of the metals replacing one\r\n       another in salts. He showed that copper displaces silver from\r\n       its salt, and that zinc displaces copper and a whole series of\r\n       other metals. Those quantities of metals which were capable of\r\n       replacing one another were termed equivalents.\r\n\r\n       Richter's teaching found no followers, because, although he\r\n       fully believed in the discoveries of Lavoisier, yet he still\r\n       held to the phlogistic reasonings which rendered his expositions\r\n       very obscure. The works of the Swedish savant Berzelius freed\r\n       the facts discovered by Wenzel and Richter from the obscurity\r\n       of former conceptions, and led to their being explained in\r\n       accordance with Lavoisier's views, and in the sense of the law of\r\n       multiple proportions which had already been discovered by Dalton.\r\n       On applying to salts those conclusions which Berzelius arrived at\r\n       by a whole series of researches of remarkable accuracy, we arrive\r\n       at the following law of equivalents--_one part by weight of\r\n       hydrogen in an acid is replaced by the corresponding equivalent\r\n       weight of any metal_; and, therefore, when metals replace each\r\n       other their weights are in the same ratio as their equivalents.\r\n       Thus, for instance, one part by weight of hydrogen is replaced by\r\n       23 parts of sodium, 39 parts of potassium, 12 parts of magnesium,\r\n       20 parts of calcium, 28 parts of iron, 108 parts of silver, 33\r\n       parts of zinc, &c.; and, therefore, if zinc replaces silver, then\r\n       33 parts of zinc will take the place of 108 parts of silver, or\r\n       33 parts of zinc will he substituted by 23 parts of sodium, &c.\r\n\r\n       The doctrine of equivalents would be precise and simple did\r\n       every metal only give one oxide or one salt. It is rendered\r\n       complicated from the fact that many metals form several oxides,\r\n       and consequently offer different equivalents in their different\r\n       degrees of oxidation. For example, there are oxides containing\r\n       iron in which its equivalent is 28--this is in the salts formed\r\n       by the suboxide; and there is another series of salts in which\r\n       the equivalent of iron equals 18-2/3--which contain less iron,\r\n       and consequently more oxygen, and correspond with a higher degree\r\n       of oxidation--ferric oxide. It is true that the former salts are\r\n       easily formed by the direct action of metallic iron on acids, and\r\n       the latter only by a further oxidation of the compound formed\r\n       already; but this is not always so. In the case of copper,\r\n       mercury, and tin, under different circumstances, salts are formed\r\n       which correspond with different degrees of oxidation of these\r\n       metals, and many metals have two equivalents in their different\r\n       salts--that is, in salts corresponding with the different degrees\r\n       of oxidation. Thus it is impossible to endow every metal with one\r\n       definite equivalent weight. Hence the conception of equivalents,\r\n       while playing an important part from an historical point of view,\r\n       appears, with a fuller study of chemistry, to be but subordinate\r\n       to a higher conception, with which we shall afterwards become\r\n       acquainted.\r\n\r\n       The fate of the theoretical views of chemistry was for a\r\n       long time bound up with the history of salts. The clearest\r\n       representation of this subject dates back to Lavoisier, and was\r\n       systematically developed by Berzelius. This representation is\r\n       called the _binary_ theory. All compounds, and especially salts,\r\n       are represented as consisting of two parts. Salts are represented\r\n       as compounds of a basic oxide (a base) and an acid (that is, an\r\n       anhydride of an acid, then termed an acid), whilst hydrates are\r\n       represented as compounds of anhydrous oxides with water. Such\r\n       an expression was employed not only to denote the most usual\r\n       method of formation of these substances (where it would be quite\r\n       true), but also to express that internal distribution of the\r\n       elements by which it was proposed to explain all the properties\r\n       of these substances. Copper sulphate was supposed to contain\r\n       two most intimate component parts--copper oxide and sulphuric\r\n       anhydride. This is an hypothesis. It arose from the so-called\r\n       _electro-chemical hypothesis_, which supposed the two component\r\n       parts to be held in mutual union, because one component (the\r\n       anhydride of the acid) has electro-negative properties, and the\r\n       other (the base in salts) electro-positive. The two parts are\r\n       attracted together, like substances having opposite electrical\r\n       charges. But as the decomposition of salts in a state of fusion\r\n       by an electric current always gives a metal, that representation\r\n       of the constitution and decomposition of salts called the\r\n       _hydrogen theory_ of acids is nearer the truth than that which\r\n       considers salts as made up of a base and an anhydride of an acid.\r\n       But the hydrogen theory of acids is also a binary hypothesis,\r\n       and does not contradict the electro-chemical hypothesis, but\r\n       is rather a modification of it. The binary theory dates from\r\n       Rouelle and Lavoisier, the electro-chemical aspect was zealously\r\n       developed by Berzelius, and the hydrogen theory of acids is due\r\n       to Davy and Liebig.\r\n\r\n       These hypothetical views simplified and generalised the study of\r\n       a complicated subject, and served to support further arguments,\r\n       but when salts were in question it was equally convenient to\r\n       follow one or the other of these hypotheses. But these theories\r\n       were brought to bear on all other substances, on all compound\r\n       substances. Those holding the binary and electro-chemical\r\n       hypotheses searched for two anti-polar component parts, and\r\n       endeavoured to express the process of chemical reactions by\r\n       electro-chemical and similar differences. If zinc replaces\r\n       hydrogen, they concluded that it is more electro-positive\r\n       than hydrogen, whilst they forgot that hydrogen may, under\r\n       different circumstances, displace zinc--for instance, at a\r\n       red heat. Chlorine and oxygen were considered as being of\r\n       opposite polarity to hydrogen because they easily combine with\r\n       it, nevertheless both are capable of replacing hydrogen, and,\r\n       what is very characteristic, in the replacement of hydrogen\r\n       by chlorine in carbon compounds not only does the chemical\r\n       character often remain unaltered, but even the external form\r\n       may remain unchanged, as Laurent and Dumas demonstrated. These\r\n       considerations undermine the binary, and more especially the\r\n       electro-chemical theory. An explanation of known reactions then\r\n       began to be sought for not in the difference of the polarity of\r\n       the different substances, but in the joint influences of all the\r\n       elements on the properties of the compound formed. This is the\r\n       reverse of the preceding hypothesis.\r\n\r\n       This reversal was not, however, limited to the destruction of\r\n       the tottering foundations of the preceding theory; it proposed a\r\n       new doctrine, and laid the foundation for the modern course of\r\n       our science. This doctrine may be termed the unitary theory--that\r\n       is, it strictly acknowledges the joint influences of the elements\r\n       in a compound substance, denies the existence of separate and\r\n       contrary components in them, regards copper sulphate, for\r\n       instance, as a strictly definite compound of copper, sulphur,\r\n       and oxygen; then seeks for compounds which are analogous in\r\n       their properties, and, placing them side by side, endeavours\r\n       to express the influence of each element in determining the\r\n       united properties of its compound. In the majority of cases it\r\n       arrives at conclusions similar to those which are obtained by\r\n       the above-mentioned hypotheses, but in certain special cases the\r\n       conclusions of the unitary theory are in entire opposition to\r\n       those of the binary theory and its corollaries. Cases of this\r\n       kind are most often met with in the consideration of compounds of\r\n       a more complex nature than salts, especially organic compounds\r\n       containing hydrogen. But it is not in this change from an\r\n       artificial to a natural system, important as it is, that the\r\n       chief service and strength of the unitary doctrine lies. By a\r\n       simple review of the vast store of data regarding the reactions\r\n       of typical substances, it succeeded from its first appearance\r\n       in establishing a new and important law, it introduced a new\r\n       conception into science--namely, the conception of molecules,\r\n       with which we shall soon become acquainted. The deduction of\r\n       the law and of the conception of molecules has been verified by\r\n       facts in a number of cases, and was the cause of the majority of\r\n       chemists of our times deserting the binary theory and accepting\r\n       the unitary theory, which forms the basis of the present work.\r\n       Laurent and Gerhardt must be considered as the founders of this\r\n       doctrine.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as oxygen compounds predominate in nature, it should be\r\nexpected from what has been said above, that salts, rather than acids\r\nor bases, would occur most frequently in nature, for these latter would\r\nalways tend to combine forming salts, especially through the medium\r\nof the all-pervading water. And, as a matter of fact, salts are found\r\neverywhere in nature. They occur in animals and plants, although in\r\nbut small quantity, because, as forming the last stage of chemical\r\nreaction, they are capable of only a few chemical transformations. And\r\norganisms are bodies in which a series of uninterrupted, varied, and\r\nactive chemical transformations proceed, whilst salts, which only enter\r\ninto double decompositions between each other, are little prone to such\r\nchanges. But organisms always contain salts. Thus, for instance, bones\r\ncontain calcium phosphate, the juice of grapes potassium tartrate (cream\r\nof tartar), certain lichens calcium oxalate, and the shells of mollusca\r\ncalcium carbonate, &c. As regards water and soil, portions of the earth\r\nin which the chemical processes are less active, they are full of\r\nsalts. Thus the waters of the oceans, and all others (Chap. I.), abound\r\nin salts, and in the soil, in the rocks of the earth's crust, in the\r\nupheaved lavas, and in the falling meteorites the salts of silicic acid,\r\nand especially its double salts, predominate. Saline substances also\r\nmake up the composition of those limestones which often form mountain\r\nchains and whole thicknesses of the earth's strata, these consisting of\r\ncalcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}.\r\n\r\nThus we have seen oxygen in a free state and in various compounds\r\nof different degrees of stability, from the unstable salts, like\r\nBerthollet's salt and nitre, to the most stable silicon compounds, such\r\nas exist in granite. We saw an entirely similar gradation of stability\r\nin the compounds of water and of hydrogen. In all its aspects oxygen,\r\nas an element, or single substance, remains the same however varied\r\nits chemical states, just as a substance may appear in many different\r\nphysical states of aggregation. But our notion of the immense variety of\r\nthe chemical states in which oxygen can occur would not be completely\r\nunderstood if we did not make ourselves acquainted with it in the form\r\nin which it occurs in ozone and peroxide of hydrogen. In these it is\r\nmost active, its energy seems to have increased. They illustrate fresh\r\naspects of chemical correlations, and the variety of the forms in which\r\nmatter can appear stand out clearly. We will therefore consider these\r\ntwo substances somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                OZONE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE--DALTON'S LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nVAN MARUM, during the last century, observed that oxygen in a glass\r\ntube, when subjected to the action of a series of electric sparks,\r\nacquired a peculiar smell, and the property of combining with mercury\r\nat the ordinary temperature. This was afterwards confirmed by a number\r\nof fresh experiments. Even in the simple revolution of an electrical\r\nmachine, when electricity diffuses into the air or passes through\r\nit, the peculiar and characteristic smell of ozone, proceeding from\r\nthe action of the electricity on the oxygen of the atmosphere, is\r\nrecognised. In 1840 Prof. Schönbein, of Basle, turned his attention to\r\nthis odoriferous substance, and showed that it is also formed, with the\r\noxygen evolved at the positive pole, in the decomposition of water by\r\nthe action of a galvanic current; in the oxidation of phosphorus in damp\r\nair, and also in the oxidation of a number of substances, although it\r\nis distinguished for its instability and capacity for oxidising other\r\nsubstances. The characteristic smell of this substance gave it its name,\r\nfrom the Greek [Greek: ozô], 'I emit an odour.' Schönbein pointed out\r\nthat _ozone_ is capable of oxidising many substances on which oxygen\r\ndoes not act at the ordinary temperature. It will be sufficient to point\r\nout for instance that it oxidises silver, mercury, charcoal, and iron\r\nwith great energy at the ordinary temperature. It might be thought that\r\nozone was some new compound substance, as it was at first supposed to\r\nbe; but careful observations made in this direction have long led to the\r\nconclusion that ozone is nothing but oxygen altered in its properties.\r\nThis is most strikingly proved by the complete transformation of oxygen\r\ncontaining ozone into ordinary oxygen when it is passed through a tube\r\nheated to 250°. Further, at a low temperature pure oxygen gives ozone\r\nwhen electric sparks are passed through it (Marignac and De la Rive).\r\nHence it is proved both by synthesis and analysis that ozone is that\r\nsame oxygen with which we are already acquainted, only endowed with\r\nparticular properties and in a particular state. However, by whatever\r\nmethod it be obtained, the amount of it contained in the oxygen is\r\ninconsiderable, generally only a few fractions per cent., rarely 2 per\r\ncent., and only under very propitious circumstances as much as 20 per\r\ncent. The reason of this must be looked for first in the fact that\r\n_ozone in its formation from oxygen absorbs heat_. If any substance\r\nbe burnt in a calorimeter at the expense of ozonised oxygen, then\r\nmore heat is evolved than when it is burnt in ordinary oxygen, and\r\nBerthelot showed that this difference is very large--namely, 29,600\r\nheat units correspond with every forty-eight parts by weight of ozone.\r\nThis signifies that the transformation of forty-eight parts of oxygen\r\ninto ozone is accompanied by the absorption of this quantity of heat,\r\nand that the reverse process evolves this quantity of heat. Therefore\r\nthe passage of ozone into oxygen should take place easily and fully\r\n(as an exothermal reaction), like combustion; and this is proved by\r\nthe fact that at 250° ozone entirely disappears, forming oxygen. Any\r\nrise of temperature may thus bring about the breaking up of ozone, and\r\nas a rise of temperature takes place in the action of an electrical\r\ndischarge, there are in an electric discharge the conditions both for\r\nthe preparation of ozone and for its destruction. Hence it is clear\r\nthat the transformation of oxygen into ozone _as a reversible reaction_\r\nhas a limit when a state of equilibrium is arrived at between the\r\nproducts of the two opposite reactions, that the phenomena of this\r\ntransformation accord with the phenomena of _dissociation_, and that\r\na fall of temperature should aid the formation of a large quantity of\r\nozone.[1] Further, it is evident, from what has been said, that the best\r\nway of preparing ozone is not by electric sparks,[2] which raise the\r\ntemperature, but by the employment of a continual discharge or flow of\r\nelectricity--that is, by the action of a _silent discharge_.[3] For this\r\nreason all _ozonisers_ (which are of most varied construction), or\r\nforms of apparatus for the preparation of ozone from oxygen (or air) by\r\nthe action of electricity, now usually consist of sheets of metal--for\r\ninstance, tinfoil--a solution of sulphuric acid mixed with chromic acid,\r\n&c. separated by thin glass surfaces placed at short distances from each\r\nother, and between which the oxygen or air to be ozonised is introduced\r\nand subjected to the action of a silent discharge.[4] Thus in Siemens'\r\napparatus (fig. 37) the exterior of the tube _a_ and the interior of\r\nthe tube _b c_ are coated with tinfoil and connected with the poles of\r\na source of electricity (with the terminals of a Ruhmkorff's coil). A\r\nsilent discharge passes through the thin walls of the glass cylinders\r\n_a_ and _b c_ over all their surfaces, and consequently, if oxygen be\r\npassed through the apparatus by the tube _d_, fused into the side of\r\n_a_, it will be ozonised in the annular space between _a_ and _b c_. The\r\nozonised oxygen escapes by the tube _e_, and may be introduced into any\r\nother apparatus.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Siemens' apparatus for preparing ozone by means\r\nof a silent discharge.]\r\n\r\n  [1] This conclusion, deduced by me as far back as 1878 (_Moniteur\r\n      Scientifique_) by conceiving the molecules of ozone (see later)\r\n      as more complex than those of oxygen, and ozone as containing\r\n      a greater quantity of heat than oxygen, has been proved\r\n      experimentally by the researches of Mailfert (1880), who showed\r\n      that the passage of a silent discharge through a litre of oxygen\r\n      at 0° may form up to 14 milligrams of ozone, and at -30° up to\r\n      60 milligrams; but best of all in the determinations of Chappuis\r\n      and Hautefeuille (1880), who found that at a temperature of -25° a\r\n      silent discharge converted 20 p.c. of oxygen into ozone, whilst\r\n      at 20° it was impossible to obtain more than 12 p.c., and at 100°\r\n      less than 2 p.c. of ozone was obtained.\r\n\r\n  [2] A series of electric sparks may be obtained by an ordinary\r\n      electrical machine, the electrophorus machines of Holtz and\r\n      Teploff, &c., Leyden jars, Ruhmkorff coils, or similar means, when\r\n      the opposite electricities are able to accumulate at the terminals\r\n      of conductors, and a discharge of sufficient electrical intensity\r\n      passes through the non-conductors air or oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [3] A silent discharge is such a combination of opposite statical\r\n      (potential) electricities as takes place (generally between large\r\n      surfaces) regularly, without sparks, slowly, and quietly (as in\r\n      the dispersion of electricity). The discharge is only luminous\r\n      in the dark; there is no observable rise of temperature, and\r\n      therefore a larger amount of ozone is formed. But, nevertheless,\r\n      on continuing the passage of a silent discharge through ozone it\r\n      is destroyed. For the action to be observable a large surface is\r\n      necessary, and consequently a source of electricity at a high\r\n      potential. For this reason the silent discharge is best produced\r\n      by a Ruhmkorff coil, as the most convenient means of obtaining a\r\n      considerable potential of statical electricity with the employment\r\n      of the comparatively feeble current of a galvanic battery.\r\n\r\n  [4] _v. Babo's apparatus_ was one of the first constructed for\r\n      ozonising oxygen by means of a silent discharge (and it is still\r\n      one of the best). It is composed of a number (twenty and more) of\r\n      long, thin capillary glass tubes closed at one end. A platinum\r\n      wire, extending along their whole length, is introduced into the\r\n      other end of each tube, and this end is then fused up round the\r\n      wire, the end of which protrudes outside the tube. The protruding\r\n      ends of the wires are arranged alternately in two sides in such a\r\n      manner that on one side there are ten closed ends and ten wires.\r\n      A bunch of such tubes (forty should make a bunch of not more than\r\n      1 c.m. diameter) is placed in a glass tube, and the ends of the\r\n      wires are connected with two conductors, and are fused to the ends\r\n      of the surrounding tube. The discharge of a Ruhmkorff coil is\r\n      passed through these ends of the wires, and the dry air or oxygen\r\n      to be ozonised is passed through the tube. If oxygen be passed\r\n      through, ozone is obtained in large quantities, and free from\r\n      oxides of nitrogen, which are partially formed when air is acted\r\n      on. At low temperatures ozone is formed in large quantities. As\r\n      ozone acts on corks and india-rubber, the apparatus should be made\r\n      entirely of glass. With a powerful Ruhmkorff coil and forty tubes\r\n      the ozonation is so powerful that the gas when passed through a\r\n      solution of iodide of potassium not only sets the iodine free, but\r\n      even oxidises it to potassium iodate, so that in five minutes the\r\n      gas-conducting tube is choked up with crystals of the insoluble\r\n      iodate.\r\n\r\n  [5] In order to connect the ozoniser with any other apparatus it is\r\n      impossible to make use of india-rubber, mercury, or cements, &c.,\r\n      because they are themselves acted on by, and act on, ozone. All\r\n      connections must, as was first proposed by Brodie, be hermetically\r\n      closed by sulphuric acid, which is not acted on by ozone. Thus, a\r\n      cork is passed over the vertical end of a tube, over which a wide\r\n      tube passes so that the end of the first tube protrudes above the\r\n      cork; mercury is first poured over the cork (to prevent its being\r\n      acted on by the sulphuric acid), and then sulphuric acid is poured\r\n      over the mercury. The protruding end of the first tube is covered\r\n      by the lower end of a third tube immersed in the sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n_The properties of ozone_ obtained by such a method[6] distinguish it\r\nin many respects from oxygen. Ozone very rapidly decolorises indigo,\r\nlitmus, and many other dyes by oxidising them. Silver is oxidised by it\r\nat the ordinary temperature, whilst oxygen is not able to oxidise silver\r\neven at high temperatures; a bright silver plate rapidly turns black\r\n(from oxidation) in ozonised oxygen. It is rapidly absorbed by mercury,\r\nforming oxide; it transforms the lower oxides into higher--for instance,\r\nsulphurous anhydride into sulphuric, nitrous oxide into nitric,\r\narsenious anhydride (As_{2}O_{3}) into arsenic anhydride (As_{2}O_{5})\r\n&c.[7] But what is especially characteristic in ozone is the decomposing\r\naction it exerts on potassium iodide. Oxygen does not act on it, but\r\nozone passed into a solution of potassium iodide _liberates iodine_,\r\nwhilst the potassium is obtained as caustic potash, which remains in\r\nsolution, 2KI + H_{2}O + O = 2KHO + I_{2}. As the presence of minute\r\ntraces of free iodine may be discovered by means of starch paste,\r\nwith which it forms a very dark blue-coloured substance, a mixture of\r\npotassium iodide with starch paste will detect the presence of very\r\nsmall traces of ozone.[8] Ozone is destroyed or converted into ordinary\r\noxygen not only by heat, but also by long keeping, especially in the\r\npresence of alkalis, peroxide of manganese, chlorine, &c.\r\n\r\n  [6] The method above described is the only one which has been well\r\n      investigated. The admixture of nitrogen, or even of hydrogen,\r\n      and especially of silicon fluoride, appears to aid the formation\r\n      and preservation of ozone. Amongst other methods for preparing\r\n      ozone we may mention the following: 1. In the action of oxygen on\r\n      phosphorus at the ordinary temperature a portion of the oxygen\r\n      is converted into ozone. At the ordinary temperature a stick of\r\n      phosphorus, partially immersed in water and partially in air in\r\n      a large glass vessel, causes the air to acquire the odour of\r\n      ozone. It must further be remarked that if the air be left for\r\n      long in contact with the phosphorus, or without the presence of\r\n      water, the ozone formed is destroyed by the phosphorus. 2. By the\r\n      action of sulphuric acid on peroxide of barium. If the latter\r\n      be covered with strong sulphuric acid (the acid, if diluted\r\n      with only one-tenth of water, does not give ozone), then at a\r\n      low temperature the oxygen evolved contains ozone, and in much\r\n      greater quantities than in that ozone is obtained by the action\r\n      of electric sparks or phosphorus. 3. Ozone may also be obtained\r\n      by decomposing strong sulphuric acid by potassium manganate\r\n      especially with the addition of barium peroxide.\r\n\r\n  [7] Ozone takes up the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid; chlorine is\r\n      liberated, and can dissolve gold. Iodine is directly oxidised\r\n      by ozone, but not by oxygen. Ammonia, NH_{3}, is oxidised by\r\n      ozone into ammonium nitrite (and nitrate), 2NH_{3} + O_{3} =\r\n      NH_{4}NO_{2} + H_{2}O, and therefore a drop of ammonia, on\r\n      falling into the gas, gives a thick cloud of the salts formed.\r\n      Ozone converts lead oxide into peroxide, and suboxide of\r\n      thallium (which is colourless) into oxide (which is brown), so\r\n      that this reaction is made use of for detecting the presence of\r\n      ozone. Lead sulphide, PbS (black), is converted into sulphate,\r\n      PbSO_{4} (colourless), by ozone. A neutral solution of manganese\r\n      sulphate gives a precipitate of manganese peroxide, and an acid\r\n      solution may be oxidised into permanganic acid, HMnO_{4}. With\r\n      respect to the oxidising action of ozone on organic substances,\r\n      it may be mentioned that with ether, C_{4}H_{10}O, ozone gives\r\n      ethyl peroxide, which is capable of decomposing with explosion\r\n      (according to Berthelot), and is decomposed by water into alcohol,\r\n      2C_{2}H_{6}O, and hydrogen peroxide, H_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [8] This reaction is the one usually made use of for detecting the\r\n      presence of ozone. In the majority of cases paper is soaked in\r\n      solutions of potassium iodide and starch. Such _ozonometrical_\r\n      or iodised starch-paper when damp turns blue in the presence\r\n      of ozone, and the tint obtained varies considerably, according\r\n      to the length of time it is exposed and to the amount of ozone\r\n      present. The amount of ozone in a given gas may even to a certain\r\n      degree he judged by the shade of colour acquired by the paper, if\r\n      preliminary tests be made.\r\n\r\n      Test-paper for ozone is prepared in the following manner:--One\r\n      gram of neutral potassium iodide is dissolved in 100 grams of\r\n      distilled water; 10 grams of starch are then shaken up in the\r\n      solution, and the mixture is boiled until the starch is converted\r\n      into a jelly. This jelly is then smeared over blotting-paper and\r\n      left to dry. It must always he remembered, however, that the\r\n      colour of iodised starch-paper is changed not only by the action\r\n      of ozone, but of many other oxidisers; for example, by the oxides\r\n      of nitrogen (especially N_{2}O_{3}) and hydrogen peroxide. Houzeau\r\n      proposed soaking common litmus-paper with a solution of potassium\r\n      iodide, which in the presence of iodine would turn blue, owing to\r\n      the formation of KHO. In order to determine if the blue colour\r\n      is not produced by an alkali (ammonia) in the gas, a portion of\r\n      the paper is not soaked in the potassium iodide, but moistened\r\n      with water; this portion will then also turn blue if ammonia be\r\n      present. A reagent for distinguishing ozone from hydrogen peroxide\r\n      with certainty is not known, and therefore these substances in\r\n      very small quantities (for instance, in the atmosphere) may easily\r\n      he confounded. Until recent years the mistake has frequently been\r\n      made of ascribing the alteration of iodised starch-paper in the\r\n      air to the presence of ozone; at the present time there is reason\r\n      to believe that it is most often due to the presence of nitrous\r\n      acid (Ilosva, 1889).\r\n\r\nHence _ozone_, although it has the same _composition as oxygen_, differs\r\nfrom it in stability, and by the fact that it oxidises a number of\r\nsubstances very energetically at the ordinary temperature. In this\r\nrespect ozone resembles the oxygen of certain unstable compounds, or\r\noxygen at the moment of its liberation.[8 bis]\r\n\r\n  [8 bis] Fluorine (Chap. XI.), acting upon water at the ordinary\r\n      temperature, takes up the hydrogen, and evolves the oxygen in the\r\n      form of ozone (Moissan, 1889), and therefore the reaction must be\r\n      expressed thus:--3H_{2}O + 3F_{2} = 6HF + O_{3}.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary oxygen and ozone we see an example of one and the same\r\nsubstance, in this case an element, appearing in two states. This\r\nindicates that the properties of a substance, and even of an element,\r\nmay vary without its composition varying. Very many such cases are\r\nknown. Such cases of a chemical transformation which determine a\r\ndifference in the properties of one and the same element are termed\r\ncases of isomerism. The cause of isomerism evidently lies deep within\r\nthe essential conditions of a substance, and its investigation has\r\nalready led to a number of results of unexpected importance and of\r\nimmense scientific significance. It is easy to understand the difference\r\nbetween substances containing different elements or the same elements\r\nin different proportions. That a difference should exist in these cases\r\nnecessarily follows, if, as our knowledge compels us, we admit that\r\nthere is a radical difference in the simple bodies or elements. But\r\nwhen the composition--_i.e._ the quality and quantity of the elements\r\nin two substances is the same and yet their properties are different,\r\nthen it becomes clear that the conceptions of diverse elements and of\r\nthe varying composition of compounds, alone, are insufficient for the\r\nexpression of all the diversity of properties of matter in nature.\r\nSomething else, still more profound and internal than the composition of\r\nsubstances, must, judging from isomerism, determine the properties and\r\ntransformation of substances.\r\n\r\nOn what are the isomerism of ozone and oxygen, and the peculiarities\r\nof ozone, dependent? In what, besides the extra store of energy,\r\nwhich is one of the peculiarities of ozone, resides the cause of its\r\ndifference from oxygen? These questions for long occupied the minds\r\nof investigators, and were the motive for the most varied, exact, and\r\naccurate researches, which were chiefly directed to the study of the\r\nvolumetric relations exhibited by ozone. In order to acquaint the reader\r\nwith the previous researches of this kind, I cite the following from a\r\nmemoir by Soret, in the 'Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'\r\nfor 1866:\r\n\r\n'Our present knowledge of the volumetric relations of ozone may be\r\nexpressed in the following manner:\r\n\r\n'1. \"Ordinary oxygen in changing into ozone under the action of\r\nelectricity shows a diminution in volume.\" This was discovered by\r\nAndrews and Tait.\r\n\r\n'2. \"In acting on ozonised oxygen with potassium iodide and other\r\nsubstances capable of being oxidised, we destroy the ozone, but the\r\nvolume of the gas remains unchanged.\" For the researches of Andrews,\r\nSoret, v. Babo, and others showed that the proportion of ozonised oxygen\r\nabsorbed by the potassium iodide is equal to the original contraction of\r\nvolume of the oxygen--that is, in the absorption of the ozone the volume\r\nof the gas remains unchanged. From this it might be imagined that ozone,\r\nso to say, does not occupy any space--is indefinitely dense.\r\n\r\n'3. \"By the action of heat ozonised oxygen increases in volume, and is\r\ntransformed into ordinary oxygen. This increase in volume corresponds\r\nwith the quantity of ozonised oxygen which is given up to the potassium\r\niodide in its decomposition\" (the same observers).\r\n\r\n'4. These unquestionable experimental results lead to the conclusion\r\nthat ozone is denser than oxygen, and that in its oxidising action\r\nit gives off that portion of its substance to which is due its extra\r\ndensity distinguishing it from ordinary oxygen.'\r\n\r\nIf we imagine (says Weltzien) that _n_ volumes of ozone consist of _n_\r\nvolumes of oxygen combined with _m_ volumes of the same substance,\r\nand that ozone in oxidising gives up _m_ volumes of oxygen and leaves\r\n_n_ volumes of ordinary oxygen gas, then all the above facts can be\r\nexplained; otherwise it must be supposed that ozone is infinitely dense.\r\n'In order to determine the density of ozone' (we again cite Soret)\r\n'recourse cannot be had to the direct determination of the weight of\r\na given volume of the gas, because ozone cannot be obtained in a pure\r\nstate. It is always mixed with a very large quantity of oxygen. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to have recourse to such substances as would\r\nabsorb ozone without absorbing oxygen and without destroying the ozone.\r\nThen the density might be deduced from the decrease of volume produced\r\nin the gas by the action of this solvent in comparison with the quantity\r\nof oxygen given up to potassium iodide. Advantage must also be taken of\r\nthe determination of the increase of volume produced by the action of\r\nheat on ozone, if the volume occupied by the ozone before heating be\r\nknown.' Soret found two such substances, turpentine and oil of cinnamon.\r\n'Ozone disappears in the presence of turpentine. This is accompanied\r\nby the appearance of a dense vapour, which fills a vessel of small\r\ncapacity (0·14 litre) to such an extent that it is impenetrable to\r\ndirect solar-rays. On leaving the vessel at rest, it is observed that\r\nthe cloud of vapour settles; the clearing is first remarked at the upper\r\nportion of the vessel, and the brilliant colours of the rainbow are\r\nseen on the edge of a cloud of vapour.' Oil of cinnamon--that is, the\r\nvolatile or essential oil of the well-known spice, cinnamon--gives under\r\nsimilar circumstances the same kind of vapours, but they are much less\r\nvoluminous. On measuring the gaseous volume before and after the action\r\nof both volatile oils, a considerable decrease is remarked. On applying\r\nall the necessary corrections (for the solubility of oxygen in the oily\r\nliquids named above, for the tension of their vapour, for the change of\r\npressure, &c.) and making a series of comparative determinations, Soret\r\nobtained the following result: two volumes of ozone capable of being\r\ndissolved, when changed to ordinary (by heating a wire to a red-heat by\r\na galvanic current) increase by one volume. Hence it is evident that\r\nin the formation of ozone three volumes of oxygen give two volumes of\r\nozone--that is, its density (referred to hydrogen) = 24.\r\n\r\nThe observations and determinations of Soret showed that ozone is\r\nheavier than oxygen, and even than carbonic anhydride (because\r\nozonised oxygen passes through fine orifices more slowly than oxygen\r\nand than its mixtures with carbonic anhydride), although lighter than\r\nchlorine (it flows more rapidly through such orifices than chlorine),\r\nand they indicated that _ozone is one and a half times denser than\r\noxygen_, which may be expressed by designating a molecule of oxygen\r\nby O_{2} and of ozone by O_{3}, and hence ozone OO_{2} is comparable\r\nwith compound substances[9] formed by oxygen, as for instance CO_{2},\r\nSO_{2}, NO_{2}, &c. This explains the chief differences between ozone\r\nand oxygen and the cause of the isomerism, and at the same time leads\r\none to expect[10] that ozone, being a gas which is denser than oxygen,\r\nwould be liquefied much more easily. This was actually shown to be the\r\ncase in 1880, by Chappuis and Hautefeuille in their researches on the\r\n_physical properties of ozone_. Its boiling point under a pressure of\r\n760 mm. is about -106°, and consequently compressed and refrigerated\r\nozone when rapidly expanded forms drops, _i.e._ is liquefied. Liquid\r\nand compressed[11] ozone is blue. In dissolving in water ozone partly\r\npasses into oxygen. It explodes violently when suddenly compressed and\r\nheated, changing into ordinary oxygen and evolving, like all explosive\r\nsubstances,[12] that extra heat which distinguishes it from oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [9] Ozone is, so to say, an oxide of oxygen, just as water is an oxide\r\n      of hydrogen. Just as aqueous vapour is composed of two volumes of\r\n      hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, which on combining condense\r\n      into two volumes of aqueous vapour, so also two volumes of oxygen\r\n      are combined in ozone with one volume of oxygen to give two\r\n      volumes of ozone. In the action of ozone on different substances\r\n      it is only that additional portion of its molecule by which it\r\n      differs from ordinary oxygen that combines with other bodies, and\r\n      that is why, under these circumstances, the volume of the ozonised\r\n      oxygen does not change. Starting with two volumes of ozone,\r\n      one-third of its weight is parted with, and two volumes of oxygen\r\n      remain.\r\n\r\n      The above observations of Soret on the capacity of turpentine\r\n      for dissolving ozone, together with Schönbein's researches on\r\n      the formation of ozone in the oxidation of turpentine and of\r\n      similar volatile vegetable oils (entering into the composition\r\n      of _perfumes_), also explain the action of this ethereal oil on\r\n      a great many substances. It is known that turpentine oil, when\r\n      mixed with many substances, promotes their oxidation. In this case\r\n      it probably not only itself promotes the formation of ozone, but\r\n      also dissolves ozone from the atmosphere, and thus acquires the\r\n      property of oxidising many substances. It bleaches linen and cork,\r\n      decolorises indigo, promotes the oxidation and hardening of boiled\r\n      linseed oil, &c. These properties of turpentine oil are made use\r\n      of in practice. Dirty linen and many stained materials are easily\r\n      cleaned by turpentine, not only because it dissolves the grease,\r\n      but also because it oxidises it. The admixture of turpentine with\r\n      drying (boiled) oil, oil-colours, and lacs aids their rapid drying\r\n      because it attracts ozone. Various oils occurring in plants,\r\n      and entering into the composition of perfumes and certain scent\r\n      extracts, also act as oxidisers. They act in the same manner as\r\n      oil of turpentine and oil of cinnamon. This perhaps explains\r\n      the refreshing influence they have in scents and other similar\r\n      preparations, and also the salubrity of the air of pine forests.\r\n      Water upon which a layer of turpentine oil has been poured\r\n      acquires, when left standing in the light, the disinfecting and\r\n      oxidising properties in general of ozonised turpentine (is this\r\n      due to the formation of H_{2}O_{2}?).\r\n\r\n  [10] The densest, most complex, and heaviest particles of matter\r\n       should, under equal conditions, evidently be less capable of\r\n       passing into a state of gaseous motion, should sooner attain a\r\n       liquid state, and have a greater cohesive force.\r\n\r\n  [11] The blue colour proper to ozone may be seen through a tube one\r\n       metre long, filled with oxygen, containing 10 p.c. of ozone.\r\n       The density of liquid ozone has not, so far as I am aware, been\r\n       determined.\r\n\r\n  [12] All explosive bodies and mixtures (gunpowder, detonating gas,\r\n       &c.) evolve heat in exploding--that is, the reactions which\r\n       accompany explosions are exothermal. In this manner ozone in\r\n       decomposing evolves latent heat, although generally heat is\r\n       absorbed in decomposition. This shows the meaning and cause of\r\n       explosion.\r\n\r\nThus, judging by what has been said above, ozone should he formed in\r\nnature not only in the many processes of oxidation which go on, but also\r\nby the condensation of atmospheric oxygen. The significance of ozone\r\nin nature has often arrested the attention of observers. There is a\r\nseries of ozonometrical observations which show the different amounts\r\nof ozone in the air at different localities, at different times of the\r\nyear, and under different circumstances. But the observations made in\r\nthis direction cannot be considered as sufficiently exact, because the\r\nmethods in use for determining ozone were not quite accurate. It is\r\nhowever indisputable[13] that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere is\r\nsubject to variation; that the air of dwellings contains no ozone (it\r\ndisappears in oxidising organic matter); that the air of fields and\r\nforests always contains ozone, or substances (peroxide of hydrogen)\r\nwhich act like it (on iodised starch paper &c.)[13 bis]; that the amount\r\nof ozone increases after storms; and that miasms, &c., are destroyed by\r\nozonising the atmosphere. It easily oxidises organic substances, and\r\nmiasms are produced by organic substances and the germs of organisms,\r\nall of which are easily changed and oxidised. Indeed, many miasms--for\r\ninstance, the volatile substance of decomposing organisms--are clearly\r\ndestroyed or changed not only by ozone, but also by many other\r\npowerfully oxidising substances, such as chlorine water, potassium\r\npermanganate, and the like.[14] All that is now known respecting\r\nthe presence of ozone in the air may be summed up in the following\r\nwords: A small quantity of an oxidising substance, resembling ozone\r\nin its reactions, has undoubtedly been observed and determined in the\r\natmosphere, especially in fresh air, for instance after a storm, and it\r\nis very likely that this substance contains a mixture of such oxidising\r\nsubstances as ozone, peroxide of hydrogen, and the lower oxides of\r\nnitrogen (especially nitrous acid and its ammonia salt) produced from\r\nthe elements of the atmosphere by oxidation and by the action of\r\nelectrical discharges.\r\n\r\n  [13] In Paris it has been found that the further from the centre of the\r\n       town the greater the amount of ozone in the air. The reason of\r\n       this is evident: in a city there are many conditions for the\r\n       destruction of ozone. This is why we distinguish country air\r\n       as being fresh. In spring the air contains more ozone than in\r\n       autumn; the air of fields more than the air of towns.\r\n\r\n  [13 bis] The question of the presence of ozone in the air has not yet\r\n       been fully elucidated, as those reactions by which ozone is\r\n       generally detected are also common to nitrous acid (and its\r\n       ammonia salt). Ilosvay de Ilosva (1889), in order to exclude\r\n       the influence of such bodies, passed air through a 40 per cent.\r\n       solution of caustic soda, and then through a 20 per cent.\r\n       solution of sulphuric acid (these solutions do not destroy\r\n       ozone), and tested the air thus purified for the presence of\r\n       ozone. As no ozone was then detected the author concludes that\r\n       all the effects which were formerly ascribed to ozone should\r\n       be referred to nitrous acid. But this conclusion requires more\r\n       careful verification, since the researches of Prof. Schönbein on\r\n       the presence of peroxide of hydrogen in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  [14] The oxidising action of ozone may be taken advantage of for\r\n       technical purposes; for instance, for destroying colouring\r\n       matters. It has even been employed for bleaching tissues and for\r\n       the rapid preparation of vinegar, although these methods have not\r\n       yet received wide application.\r\n\r\nThus in ozone we see (1) the capacity of elements (and it must be\r\nall the more marked in compounds) of changing in properties without\r\naltering in composition; this is termed isomerism;[15] (2) the capacity\r\nof certain elements for condensing themselves into molecules of\r\ndifferent densities; this forms a special case of isomerism called\r\n_polymerism_; (3) the capacity of oxygen for appearing in a still more\r\nactive and energetic chemical state than that in which it occurs in\r\nordinary gaseous oxygen; and (4) the formation of unstable equilibria,\r\nor chemical states, which are illustrated both by the ease with which\r\nozone acts as an oxidiser and by its capacity for decomposing with\r\nexplosion.[16]\r\n\r\n  [15] Isomerism in elements is termed _allotropism_.\r\n\r\n  [16] A number of substances resemble ozone in one or other of these\r\n       respects. Thus cyanogen, C_{2}N_{2}, nitrogen chloride, &c.,\r\n       decompose with an explosion and evolution of heat. Nitrous\r\n       anhydride, N_{2}O_{3}, forms a blue liquid like ozone, and in a\r\n       number of cases oxidises like ozone.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen peroxide._--Many of those properties which we have seen in\r\nozone belong also to a peculiar substance containing oxygen and hydrogen\r\nand called hydrogen peroxide or oxygenated water. This substance was\r\ndiscovered in 1818 by Thénard. When heated it is decomposed into\r\nwater and oxygen, evolving as much oxygen as is contained in the\r\nwater remaining after the decomposition. That portion of oxygen by\r\nwhich hydrogen peroxide differs from water behaves in a number of\r\ncases just like the active oxygen in ozone, which distinguishes it\r\nfrom ordinary oxygen. In H_{2}O_{2}, and in O_{3}, one atom of oxygen\r\nacts as a powerful oxidiser, and on separating out it leaves H_{2}O\r\nor O_{2}, which do not act so energetically, although they still\r\ncontain oxygen.[17] Both H_{2}O_{2} and O_{3} contain the oxygen in\r\na compressed state, so to speak, and when freed from pressure by the\r\nforces (internal) of the elements in another substance, this oxygen is\r\neasily evolved, and therefore acts as oxygen does at the moment of its\r\nliberation. Both substances in decomposing, with the separation of a\r\nportion of their oxygen, _evolve_ heat, whilst decomposition is usually\r\naccompanied by an absorption of heat.\r\n\r\n  [17] It is evident that there is a want of words here for distinguishing\r\n       oxygen, O, as an ultimate _element_, from oxygen, O_{2}, as a\r\n       _free element_. The latter should be termed oxygen gas, did not\r\n       custom and the length of the expression render it inconvenient.\r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide is formed under many circumstances by combustion and\r\noxidation, but in very limited quantities; thus, for instance, it is\r\nsufficient to shake up zinc with sulphuric acid, or even with water,\r\nto observe the formation of a certain quantity of hydrogen peroxide in\r\nthe water.[18] From this cause, probably, a series of diverse oxidation\r\nprocesses are accomplished in nature, and according to Prof. Schöne of\r\nMoscow, hydrogen peroxide occurs in the atmosphere, although in variable\r\nand small quantities, and probably its formation is connected with\r\nozone, with which it has much in common. The usual mode of the formation\r\nof hydrogen peroxide, and the method by which it may be indirectly\r\nobtained,[19] is by the double decomposition of an acid and the\r\nperoxides of certain metals, especially those of potassium, calcium,\r\nand barium.[20] We saw when speaking of Oxygen (Chap. III.) that it is\r\nonly necessary to heat the anhydrous oxide of barium to a red heat in a\r\ncurrent of air or oxygen (or, better still, to heat it with potassium\r\nchlorate, and then to wash away the potassium chloride formed) to obtain\r\nperoxide of barium.[21] Barium peroxide gives hydrogen peroxide by the\r\naction of acids in the cold.[22] The process of decomposition is very\r\nclear in this case; the hydrogen of the acid replaces the barium of the\r\nperoxide, a barium salt of the acid being formed, while the hydrogen\r\nperoxide formed in the reaction remains in solution.[23]\r\n\r\n  [18] Schönbein states that the formation of hydrogen peroxide is\r\n       to be remarked in every oxidation in water or in the presence\r\n       of aqueous vapour. According to Struve, hydrogen peroxide\r\n       is contained in snow and in rain-water, and its formation,\r\n       together with ozone and ammonium nitrate, is even probable in\r\n       the processes of respiration and combustion. A solution of tin\r\n       in mercury, or liquid tin amalgam, when shaken up in water\r\n       containing sulphuric acid, produces hydrogen peroxide, whilst\r\n       iron under the same circumstances does not give rise to its\r\n       formation. The presence of small quantities of hydrogen peroxide\r\n       in these and similar cases is recognised by many reactions.\r\n       Amongst them, its action on _chromic acid_ in the presence of\r\n       ether is very characteristic. Hydrogen peroxide converts the\r\n       chromic acid into a higher oxide, Cr_{2}O_{7}, which is of a\r\n       dark-blue colour and dissolves in ether. This ethereal solution\r\n       is to a certain degree stable, and therefore the presence of\r\n       hydrogen peroxide may be recognised by mixing the liquid to be\r\n       tested with ether and adding several drops of a solution of\r\n       chromic acid. On shaking the mixture the ether dissolves the\r\n       higher oxide of chromium which is formed, and acquires a blue\r\n       colour. The formation of hydrogen peroxide in the combustion and\r\n       oxidation of substances containing or evolving hydrogen must\r\n       be understood in the light of the conception, to be considered\r\n       later, of molecules occupying equal volumes in a gaseous state.\r\n       At the moment of its evolution a molecule H_{2} combines with\r\n       a molecule O_{2}, and gives H_{2}O_{2}. As this substance is\r\n       unstable, a large proportion of it is decomposed, a small amount\r\n       only remaining unchanged. If it is obtained, water is easily\r\n       formed from it; this reaction evolves heat, and the reverse\r\n       action is not very probable. Direct determinations show that\r\n       the reaction H_{2}O_{2} = H_{2}O + O evolves 22,000 heat units.\r\n       From this it will be understood how easy is the decomposition\r\n       of hydrogen peroxide, as well as the fact that a number of\r\n       substances which are not directly oxidised by oxygen are oxidised\r\n       by hydrogen peroxide and by ozone, which also evolves heat on\r\n       decomposition. Such a representation of the origin of hydrogen\r\n       peroxide has been developed by me since 1870. Recently (1890)\r\n       Traube has pronounced a similar opinion, stating that Zn under\r\n       the action of water and air gives, besides ZnH_{2}O_{2}, also\r\n       H_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [19] The formation of hydrogen peroxide from barium peroxide by a\r\n       method of double decomposition is an instance of a number of\r\n       _indirect methods of preparation_. A substance A does not combine\r\n       with B, but A B is obtained from A C in its action on B D (see\r\n       Introduction) when C D is formed. Water does not combine with\r\n       oxygen, but as a hydrate of acids it acts on the compound of\r\n       oxygen with barium oxide, because this oxide gives a salt with an\r\n       acid anhydride; or, what is the same thing, hydrogen with oxygen\r\n       does not directly form hydrogen peroxide, but when combined with\r\n       a haloid (for example, chlorine), under the action of barium\r\n       peroxide, BaO_{2}, it leads to the formation of a salt of barium\r\n       and H_{2}O_{2}. It is to be remarked that the passage of barium\r\n       oxide, BaO, into the peroxide, BaO_{2}, is accompanied by the\r\n       _evolution_ of 12,100 heat units per 16 parts of oxygen by weight\r\n       combined, and the passage of H_{2}O into the peroxide H_{2}O_{2}\r\n       does not proceed directly, because it would be accompanied by the\r\n       _absorption_ of 22,000 units of heat by 16 parts by weight of\r\n       oxygen combined. Barium peroxide, in acting on an acid, evidently\r\n       evolves less heat than the oxide, and it is this difference of\r\n       heat that is absorbed in the hydrogen peroxide. Its energy is\r\n       obtained from that evolved in the formation of the salt of barium.\r\n\r\n  [20] Peroxides of lead and manganese, and other analogous peroxides\r\n       (see Chap. III., Note 9), do not give hydrogen peroxide under\r\n       these conditions, but yield chlorine with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n  [21] The impure barium peroxide obtained in this manner may be easily\r\n       purified. For this purpose it is dissolved in a dilute solution\r\n       of nitric acid. A certain quantity of an insoluble residue always\r\n       remains, from which the solution is separated by filtration.\r\n       The solution will contain not only the compound of the barium\r\n       peroxide, but also a compound of the barium oxide itself,\r\n       a certain quantity of which always remains uncombined with\r\n       oxygen. The acid compounds of the peroxide and oxide of barium\r\n       are easily distinguishable by their stability. The peroxide\r\n       gives an unstable compound, and the oxide a stable salt. By\r\n       adding an aqueous solution of barium oxide to the resultant\r\n       solution, the whole of the peroxide contained in the solution\r\n       may be precipitated as a pure aqueous compound (Kouriloff, 1889,\r\n       obtained the same result by adding an excess of BaO_{2}). The\r\n       first portions of the precipitate will consist of impurities--for\r\n       instance, oxide of iron. The barium peroxide then separates out,\r\n       and is collected on a filter and washed; it forms a substance\r\n       having a definite composition, BaO_{2},8H_{2}O, and is very\r\n       pure. Pure hydrogen peroxide should always be prepared from such\r\n       purified barium peroxide.\r\n\r\n  [22] In the cold, strong sulphuric acid with barium peroxide gives\r\n       ozone; when diluted with a certain amount of water it gives\r\n       oxygen (see Note 6), and hydrogen peroxide is only obtained\r\n       by the action of very weak sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric,\r\n       hydrofluoric, carbonic, and hydrosilicofluoric acids, and others,\r\n       when diluted with water also give hydrogen peroxide with barium\r\n       peroxide. Professor Schöne, who very carefully investigated\r\n       hydrogen peroxide, showed that it is formed by the action of many\r\n       of the above-mentioned acids on barium peroxide. In preparing\r\n       peroxide of hydrogen by means of sulphuric acid, the solution\r\n       must be kept cold. A solution of maximum concentration may\r\n       be obtained by successive treatments with sulphuric acid of\r\n       increasing strength. In this manner a solution containing 2 to 3\r\n       grams of pure peroxide in 100 c.c. of water may be obtained (V.\r\n       Kouriloff).\r\n\r\n  [23] With the majority of acids, that salt of barium which is formed\r\n       remains in solution; thus, for instance, by employing\r\n       hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide and barium chloride remain\r\n       in solution. Complicated processes would be required to obtain\r\n       pure hydrogen peroxide from such a solution. It is much more\r\n       convenient to take advantage of the action of carbonic anhydride\r\n       on the pure hydrate of barium peroxide. For this purpose the\r\n       hydrate is stirred up in water, and a rapid stream of carbonic\r\n       anhydride is passed through the water. Barium carbonate,\r\n       insoluble in water, is formed, and the hydrogen peroxide remains\r\n       in solution, so that it may be separated from the carbonate\r\n       by filtering only. On a large scale hydrofluosilicic acid is\r\n       employed, its barium salt being also insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe reaction is expressed by the equation BaO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} =\r\nH_{2}O_{2} + BaSO_{4}. It is best to take a weak cold solution of\r\nsulphuric acid and to almost saturate it with barium peroxide, so that\r\na small excess of acid remains; insoluble barium sulphate is formed. A\r\nmore or less dilute aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is obtained.\r\nThis solution may be concentrated in a vacuum over sulphuric acid. In\r\nthis way the water may even be entirely evaporated from the solution of\r\nthe hydrogen peroxide; only in this case it is necessary to work at a\r\nlow temperature, and not to keep the peroxide for long in the rarefied\r\natmosphere, as otherwise it decomposes.[23 bis] A solution of peroxide\r\nof hydrogen (mixed with the solution of a salt of sodium NaX) is used\r\nfor bleaching (especially silk and wool) on a large scale, and is now\r\nusually prepared from peroxide of sodium Na_{2}O_{2} by the action of\r\nacids. Na_{2}O_{2} + 2HX = 2NaX + H_{2}O_{2}[24].\r\n\r\n  [23 bis] Hydrogen peroxide may be extracted from very dilute solutions\r\n       by means of ether, which dissolves it, and when mixed with it\r\n       the hydrogen peroxide may even be distilled. A solution of\r\n       hydrogen peroxide in water may be strengthened by cooling it to\r\n       a low temperature, when the water crystallises out--that is,\r\n       is converted into ice--whilst the hydrogen peroxide remains in\r\n       solution, as it only freezes at very low temperatures. It must be\r\n       observed that hydrogen peroxide, in a strong solution in a pure\r\n       state, is exceedingly unstable even at the ordinary temperature,\r\n       and therefore it must be preserved in vessels always kept cold,\r\n       as otherwise it evolves oxygen and forms water.\r\n\r\n  [24] Peroxide of sodium (Chap. XII., Note 49) is prepared by burning\r\n       sodium in dry air.\r\n\r\nWhen pure, hydrogen peroxide is a colourless liquid, without smell, and\r\nhaving a very unpleasant taste--such as belongs to the salts of many\r\nmetals--the so-called 'metallic' taste. Water stored in zinc vessels has\r\nthis taste, which is probably due to its containing hydrogen peroxide.\r\nThe tension of the vapour of hydrogen peroxide is less than that of\r\naqueous vapour; this enables its solutions to be concentrated in a\r\nvacuum. The specific gravity of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide is 1·455.\r\nHydrogen peroxide decomposes, with the evolution of oxygen, when heated\r\neven to 20°. But the more dilute its aqueous solution the more stable\r\nit is. Very weak solutions may be distilled without decomposing the\r\nhydrogen peroxide. It decolorises solutions of litmus and turmeric, and\r\nacts in a similar manner on many colouring matters of organic origin\r\n(for which reason it is employed for bleaching tissues).[24 bis]\r\n\r\n  [24 bis] Peroxide of hydrogen should apparently find an industrial\r\n       application in the arts, for instance, (1) as a bleaching agent,\r\n       it having the important advantage over chloride of lime, SO_{2},\r\n       &c., of not acting upon the material under treatment. It may be\r\n       used for bleaching feathers, hair, silk, wool, wood, &c., it also\r\n       removes stains of all kinds, such as wine, ink, and fruit stains;\r\n       (2) it destroys bacteria like ozone without having any injurious\r\n       effect upon the human body. It can also be used for washing all\r\n       kinds of wounds, for purifying the air in the sick room, &c., and\r\n       (3) as a preserving agent for potted meats, &c.\r\n\r\n_Many substances decompose hydrogen peroxide_, forming water and oxygen,\r\nwithout apparently suffering any change. In this case substances in a\r\nstate of fine division show a much quicker action than compact masses,\r\nfrom which it is evident that the action is here based on contact\r\n(_see_ Introduction). It is sufficient to bring hydrogen peroxide\r\ninto contact with charcoal, gold, the peroxide of manganese or lead,\r\nthe alkalis, metallic silver, and platinum, to bring about the above\r\ndecomposition.[25] Besides which, hydrogen peroxide forms water and\r\nparts with its oxygen with great ease to a number of substances which\r\nare capable of being oxidised or of combining with oxygen, and in this\r\nrespect is very like ozone and other _powerful oxidisers_.[26] To the\r\nclass of contact phenomena, which are so characteristic of hydrogen\r\nperoxide as a substance which is unstable and easily decomposable with\r\nthe evolution of heat, must be referred the following--that in the\r\npresence of many substances containing oxygen it evolves, not only its\r\nown oxygen, but also that of the substances which are brought into\r\ncontact with it--that is, _it acts in a reducing manner_. It behaves\r\nthus with ozone, the oxides of silver, mercury, gold and platinum,\r\nand lead peroxide. The oxygen in these substances is not stable, and\r\ntherefore the feeble influence of contact is enough to destroy its\r\nposition. Hydrogen peroxide, especially in a concentrated form, in\r\ncontact with these substances, evolves an immense quantity of oxygen,\r\nso that an explosion takes place and an exceedingly powerful evolution\r\nof heat is observed if hydrogen peroxide in a concentrated form be made\r\nto drop upon these substances in dry powder. Slow decomposition also\r\nproceeds in dilute solutions.[27]\r\n\r\n  [25] As the result of careful research, certain of the _catalytic_ or\r\n       contact phenomena have been subjected to exact explanation, which\r\n       shows the participation of a substance present in the process\r\n       of a reaction, whilst, however, it does not alter the series\r\n       of changes proceeding from mechanical actions only. Professor\r\n       Schöne, of the Petroffsky Academy, has already explained a\r\n       number of reactions of hydrogen peroxide which previously were\r\n       not understood. Thus, for instance, he showed that with hydrogen\r\n       peroxide, alkalis give peroxides of the alkaline metals, which\r\n       combine with the remaining hydrogen peroxide, forming unstable\r\n       compounds which are easily decomposed, and therefore alkalis\r\n       evince a decomposing (catalytic) influence on solutions of\r\n       hydrogen peroxide. Only acid solutions of hydrogen peroxide, and\r\n       then only dilute ones, can be preserved well.\r\n\r\n  [26] _Hydrogen peroxide_, as a substance containing much oxygen\r\n       (namely, 16 parts to one part by weight of hydrogen), exhibits\r\n       many _oxidising reactions_. Thus, it oxidises arsenic, converts\r\n       lime into calcium peroxide, the oxides of zinc and copper into\r\n       peroxides; it parts with its oxygen to many sulphides, converting\r\n       them into sulphates, &c. So, for example, it converts black\r\n       lead sulphide, PbS, into white lead sulphate, PbSO_{4}, copper\r\n       sulphide into copper sulphate, and so on. The restoration of old\r\n       oil paintings by hydrogen peroxide is based on this action. Oil\r\n       colours are usually admixed with white lead, and in many cases\r\n       the colour of oil-paints becomes darker in process of time. This\r\n       is partly due to the sulphuretted hydrogen contained in the\r\n       air, which acts on white lead, forming lead sulphide, which is\r\n       black. The intermixture of the black colour darkens the rest.\r\n       In cleaning a picture with a solution of hydrogen peroxide,\r\n       the black lead sulphide is converted into white sulphate, and\r\n       the colours brighten owing to the disappearance of the black\r\n       substance which previously darkened them. Hydrogen peroxide\r\n       oxidises with particular energy substances containing hydrogen\r\n       and capable of easily parting with it to oxidising substances.\r\n       Thus it decomposes hydriodic acid, setting the iodine free\r\n       and converting the hydrogen it contains into water; it also\r\n       decomposes sulphuretted hydrogen in exactly the same manner,\r\n       setting the sulphur free. Starch paste with potassium iodide\r\n       is not, however, directly coloured by peroxide of hydrogen in\r\n       the entire absence of free acids; but the addition of a small\r\n       quantity of iron sulphate (green vitriol) or of lead acetate to\r\n       the mixture is enough to entirely blacken the paste. This is a\r\n       very sensitive reagent (test) for peroxide of hydrogen, like the\r\n       test with chromic acid and ether (_see_ Note 8).\r\n\r\n  [27] To explain the phenomenon, an hypothesis has been put forward\r\n       by Brodie, Clausius, and Schönbein which supposes ordinary oxygen\r\n       to be an electrically neutral substance, composed, so to speak,\r\n       of two electrically opposite kinds of oxygen--positive and\r\n       negative. It is supposed that hydrogen peroxide contains one kind\r\n       of such polar oxygen, whilst in the oxides of the above-named\r\n       metals the oxygen is of opposite polarity. It is supposed that\r\n       in the oxides of the metals the oxygen is electro-negative, and\r\n       in hydrogen peroxide electro-positive, and that on the mutual\r\n       contact of these substances ordinary neutral oxygen is evolved\r\n       as a consequence of the mutual attraction of the oxygens of\r\n       opposite polarity. Brodie admits the polarity of oxygen in\r\n       combination, but not in an uncombined state, whilst Schönbein\r\n       supposes uncombined oxygen to be polar also, considering ozone as\r\n       electro-negative oxygen. The supposition that the oxygen of ozone\r\n       is different from that of hydrogen peroxide is contradicted by\r\n       the fact that in acting on barium peroxide strong sulphuric acid\r\n       forms ozone, and dilute acid forms hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nJust as a whole series of metallic compounds, and especially the\r\noxides and their hydrates, correspond with water, so also there are\r\nmany substances analogous to hydrogen peroxide. Thus, for instance,\r\ncalcium peroxide is related to hydrogen peroxide in exactly the same\r\nway as calcium oxide or lime is related to water. In both cases the\r\nhydrogen is replaced by a metal--namely, by calcium.[27 bis] But it is\r\nmost important to remark that the nearest approach to the properties\r\nof hydrogen peroxide is afforded by a non-metallic element, chlorine;\r\nits action on colouring matters, its capacity for oxidising, and for\r\nevolving oxygen from many oxides, is analogous to that exhibited by\r\nhydrogen peroxide. Even the very formation of chlorine is closely\r\nanalogous to the formation of peroxide of hydrogen; chlorine is obtained\r\nfrom manganese peroxide, MnO_{2}, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, and\r\nhydrogen peroxide from barium peroxide, BaO_{2}, and the same acid.\r\nThe result in one case is essentially water, chlorine, and manganese\r\nchloride; and in the other case barium chloride and hydrogen peroxide\r\nare produced. Hence water + chlorine corresponds with hydrogen peroxide,\r\nand the action of chlorine in the presence of water is analogous to the\r\naction of hydrogen peroxide. This analogy between chlorine and hydrogen\r\nperoxide is expressed in the conception of an aqueous radicle, which\r\n(Chapter III.) has been already mentioned. _This aqueous radicle_ (or\r\nhydroxyl) is that which is left from water if it be imagined as deprived\r\nof half of its hydrogen. According to this method of expression, caustic\r\nsoda will be a compound of sodium with the aqueous radicle, because it\r\nis formed from water with the evolution of half the hydrogen. This is\r\nexpressed by the following formulæ: water, H_{2}O, caustic soda, NaHO,\r\njust as hydrochloric acid is HCl and sodium chloride NaCl. Hence the\r\naqueous radicle HO is a compound radicle, just as chlorine, Cl, is a\r\nsimple radicle. They both give hydrogen compounds, HHO, water, and HCl,\r\nhydrochloric acid; sodium compounds, NaHO and NaCl, and a whole series\r\nof analogous compounds. Free chlorine in this sense will be ClCl, and\r\nhydrogen peroxide HOHO, which indeed expresses its composition, because\r\nit contains twice as much oxygen as water does.[28]\r\n\r\n  [27 bis] It should be mentioned that Schiloff (1893) on taking a 3 per\r\n       cent. solution of H_{2}O_{2}, adding soda to it, and then\r\n       extracting the peroxide of hydrogen from the mixture by shaking\r\n       it with ether, obtained a 50 per cent. solution of H_{2}O_{2},\r\n       which, although perfectly free from other acids, gave a\r\n       distinctly acid reaction with litmus. And here attention should\r\n       first of all be turned to the fact that the peroxides of the\r\n       metals correspond to H_{2}O_{2}, like salts to an acid, for\r\n       instance, Na_{2}O_{2} and BaO_{2}, &c. Furthermore, it must be\r\n       remembered that O is an analogue of S (Chapters XV. and XX.),\r\n       and sulphur gives H_{2}S, H_{2}SO_{3}, and H_{2}SO_{4}. And\r\n       sulphurous acid, H_{2}SO_{3}, is unstable as a hydrate, and\r\n       gives water and the anhydride SO_{2}. If the sulphur be replaced\r\n       by oxygen, then instead of H_{2}SO_{3} and SO_{2}, we have\r\n       H_{2}OO_{3} and OO_{2}. The latter is ozone, while the salt\r\n       K_{2}O_{4} (peroxide of potassium) corresponds to the hydrate\r\n       H_{2}O_{4} as to an acid. And between H_{2}O and H_{2}O_{4}\r\n       there may exist intermediate acid compounds, the first of which\r\n       would be H_{2}O_{2}, in which, from analogy to the sulphur\r\n       compounds, one would expect acid properties. Besides which we\r\n       may mention that for sulphur, besides H_{2}S (which is a feeble\r\n       acid), H_{2}S_{2}, H_{2}S_{3}, H_{2}S_{5} are known. Thus in\r\n       many respects H_{2}O_{2} offers points of resemblance to acid\r\n       compounds, and as regards its qualitative (reactive) analogies,\r\n       it not only resembles Na_{2}O_{2}, BaO_{2}, &c., but also\r\n       persulphuric acid HSO_{4} (to which the anhydride S_{2}O_{7}\r\n       corresponds) and Cu_{2}O_{7}, &c., which will be subsequently\r\n       described.\r\n\r\n  [28] Tamman and Carrara (1892) showed by determining the depression\r\n       (fall of the temperature of the formation of ice, Chapters I.\r\n       and VII.) that the molecule of peroxide of hydrogen contains\r\n       H_{2}O_{2}, and not HO or H_{3}O_{3}.\r\n\r\nThus in ozone and hydrogen peroxide we see examples of very unstable,\r\neasily decomposable (by time, spontaneously, and on contact) substances,\r\nfull of the energy necessary for change,[28 bis] capable of being\r\neasily reconstituted (in this case decomposing with the evolution of\r\nheat); they are therefore examples of _unstable chemical equilibria_.\r\nIf a substance exists, it signifies that it already presents a certain\r\nform of equilibrium between those elements of which it is built up.\r\nBut chemical, like mechanical, equilibria exhibit different degrees of\r\nstability or solidity.[29]\r\n\r\n  [28 bis] The lower oxides of nitrogen and chlorine and the higher oxides\r\n       of manganese are also formed with the absorption of heat, and\r\n       therefore, like hydrogen peroxide, act in a powerfully oxidising\r\n       manner, and are not formed by the same methods as the majority\r\n       of other oxides. It is evident that, being endowed with a richer\r\n       store of energy (acquired in combination or by absorption of\r\n       heat), such substances, compared with others poorer in energy,\r\n       will exhibit a greater diversity of cases of chemical action with\r\n       other substances.\r\n\r\n  [29] If the point of support of a body lies in a vertical line below\r\n       the centre of gravity, it is in unstable equilibrium. If the\r\n       centre of gravity lies below the point of support; the state of\r\n       equilibrium is very stable, and a vibration may take place about\r\n       this position of stable equilibrium, as in a pendulum or balance,\r\n       when finally the body assumes a position of stable equilibrium.\r\n       But if, keeping to the same mechanical example, the body be\r\n       supported not on a point, in the geometrical sense of the word,\r\n       but on a small plane, then the state of unstable equilibrium may\r\n       be preserved, unless destroyed by external influences. Thus a\r\n       man stands upright supported on the plane, or several points of\r\n       the surfaces of his feet, having the centre of gravity above the\r\n       points of support. Vibration is then possible, but it is limited,\r\n       otherwise on passing outside the limit of possible equilibrium\r\n       another more stable position is attained about which vibration\r\n       becomes more possible. A prism immersed in water may have several\r\n       more or less stable positions of equilibrium. The same is also\r\n       true with the atoms in molecules. Some molecules present a state\r\n       of more stable equilibrium than others. Hence from this simple\r\n       comparison it will be at once evident that the stability of\r\n       molecules may vary considerably, that one and the same elements,\r\n       taken in the same number, may give isomerides of different\r\n       stability, and, lastly, that there may exist states of equilibria\r\n       which are so unstable, so ephemeral, that they will only arise\r\n       under particularly special conditions--such, for example, as\r\n       certain hydrates mentioned in the first chapter (_see_ Notes\r\n       57, 67, and others). And if in one case the instability of a\r\n       given state of equilibrium is expressed by its instability with\r\n       a change of temperature or physical state, then in other cases\r\n       it is expressed by the facility with which it decomposes under\r\n       the influence of contact or of the chemical influence of other\r\n       substances.\r\n\r\nBesides this, hydrogen peroxide presents another side of the subject\r\nwhich is not less important, and is much clearer and more general.\r\n\r\nHydrogen unites with oxygen in two degrees of oxidation: water or\r\nhydrogen oxide, and oxygenated water or hydrogen peroxide; for a given\r\nquantity of hydrogen, the peroxide contains twice as much oxygen as does\r\nwater. This is a fresh example confirming the correctness of the law\r\nof multiple proportions, to which we have already referred in speaking\r\nof the water of crystallisation of salts. We can now formulate this\r\nlaw--_the law of multiple proportions_. _If two substances A and B\r\n(either simple or compound), unite together to form several compounds,\r\nA_{n}B_{m}, A_{q}B_{r} ..., then having expressed the compositions\r\nof all these compounds in such a way that the quantity (by weight or\r\nvolume) of one of the component parts will be a constant quantity_ A, _it\r\nwill be observed that in all the compounds_ AB_{a}, AB_{b} _... the\r\nquantities of the other component part,_ B, _will always be in\r\ncommensurable relation: generally in simple multiple proportion--that is,\r\nthat a : b ..., or m/n is to r/q as whole numbers, for instance as 2 : 3\r\nor 3 : 4...._\r\n\r\nThe analysis of water shows that in 100 parts by weight it contains\r\n11·112 parts by weight of hydrogen and 88·888 of oxygen, and the\r\nanalysis of peroxide of hydrogen shows that it contains 94·112 parts of\r\noxygen to 5·888 parts of hydrogen. In this the analysis is expressed,\r\nas analyses generally are, in percentages; that is, it gives the amounts\r\nof the elements in a hundred parts by weight of the substance. The\r\ndirect comparison of the percentage compositions of water and hydrogen\r\nperoxide does not give any simple relation. But such a relation is\r\nimmediately apparent if we calculate the composition of water and of\r\nhydrogen peroxide, having taken either the quantity of oxygen or the\r\nquantity of hydrogen as a constant quantity--for instance, as unity.\r\nThe most simple proportions show that in water there are contained\r\neight parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen, and in hydrogen peroxide\r\nsixteen parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen; or one-eighth part\r\nof hydrogen in water and one-sixteenth part of hydrogen in hydrogen\r\nperoxide to one part of oxygen. Naturally, the analysis does not give\r\nthese figures with absolute exactness--it gives them within a certain\r\ndegree of error--but they approximate, as the error diminishes, to\r\nthat limit which is here given. The comparison of the quantities of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen in the two substances above named, taking one of the\r\ncomponents as a constant quantity, gives an example of the application\r\nof the law of multiple proportions, because water contains eight parts\r\nand hydrogen peroxide sixteen parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen,\r\nand these figures are commensurable and are in the simple proportion of\r\n1 : 2.\r\n\r\nAn exactly similar multiple proportion is observed in the composition\r\nof all other well-investigated definite chemical compounds,[30] and\r\ntherefore the law of multiple proportions is accepted in chemistry as\r\nthe starting point from which other considerations proceed.\r\n\r\n  [30] When, for example, any element forms several oxides, they are\r\n       subject to the law of multiple proportions. For a given quantity\r\n       of the non-metal or metal the quantities of oxygen in the\r\n       different degrees of oxidation will stand as 1 : 2, or as 1 : 3,\r\n       or as 2 : 3, or as 2 : 7, and so on. Thus, for instance, copper\r\n       combines with oxygen in at least two proportions, forming the\r\n       oxides found in nature, and called the suboxide and the oxide of\r\n       copper, Cu_{2}O and CuO; the oxide contains twice as much oxygen\r\n       as the suboxide. Lead also presents two degrees of oxidation,\r\n       the oxide and peroxide, and in the latter there is twice as\r\n       much oxygen as in the former, PbO and PbO_{2}. When a base and\r\n       an acid are capable of forming several kinds of salts, normal,\r\n       acid, basic, and anhydro-, it is found that they also clearly\r\n       exemplify the law of multiple proportions. This was demonstrated\r\n       by Wollaston soon after the discovery of the law in question. We\r\n       saw in the first chapter that salts show different degrees of\r\n       combination with water of crystallisation, and that they obey the\r\n       law of multiple proportions. And, more than this, the indefinite\r\n       chemical compounds existing as solutions may, as we saw in the\r\n       same chapter, be brought under the law of multiple proportions\r\n       by the hypothesis that solutions are unstable hydrates formed\r\n       according to the law of multiple proportions, but occurring in\r\n       a state of dissociation. By means of this hypothesis the law of\r\n       multiple proportions becomes still more general, and all the\r\n       aspects of chemical compounds are subject to it. The direction\r\n       of the whole contemporary state of chemistry was determined by\r\n       the discoveries of Lavoisier and Dalton. By endeavouring to\r\n       prove that in solutions we have nothing else than the liquid\r\n       products of the dissociation of definite hydrates, it is my aim\r\n       to bring also this category of indefinite compounds under the\r\n       general principle enunciated by Dalton; just as astronomers have\r\n       discovered a proof and not a negation of the laws of Newton in\r\n       perturbations.\r\n\r\nThe law of multiple proportions was discovered at the beginning of this\r\ncentury by John Dalton, of Manchester, in investigating the compounds of\r\ncarbon with hydrogen. It appeared that two gaseous compounds of these\r\nsubstances--marsh gas, CH_{4}, and olefiant gas, C_{2}H_{4}, contain for\r\none and the same quantity of hydrogen, quantities of carbon which stand\r\nin multiple proportion; namely, marsh gas contains relatively half as\r\nmuch carbon as olefiant gas. Although the analysis of that time was not\r\nexact, still the accuracy of this law, recognised by Dalton, was further\r\nconfirmed by more accurate investigations. On establishing the law of\r\nmultiple proportions, Dalton gave a hypothetical explanation for it.\r\nThis explanation is based on the atomic theory of matter. In fact, the\r\nlaw of multiple proportions may be very easily understood by admitting\r\nthe atomic structure of matter.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the atomic theory is that matter is supposed to consist\r\nof an agglomeration of small and indivisible parts--atoms--which do\r\nnot fill up the whole space occupied by a substance, but stand apart\r\nfrom each other, as the sun, planets, and stars do not fill up the\r\nwhole space of the universe, but are at a distance from each other.\r\nThe form and properties of substances are determined by the position\r\nof their atoms in space and by their state of motion, whilst the\r\nreactions accomplished by substances are understood as redistributions\r\nof the relative positions of atoms and changes in their motion. The\r\natomic representation of matter arose in very ancient times,[31] and\r\nup to recent times was at variance with the dynamical hypothesis,\r\nwhich considers matter as only a manifestation of forces. At the\r\npresent time, however, the majority of scientific men uphold the atomic\r\nhypothesis, although the present conception of an atom is quite\r\ndifferent from that of the ancient philosophers. An atom at the present\r\nday is regarded rather as an individual or unit which is indivisible by\r\nphysical[32] and chemical forces, whilst the atom of the ancients was\r\nactually mechanically and geometrically indivisible. When Dalton (1804)\r\ndiscovered the law of multiple proportions, he pronounced himself in\r\nfavour of the atomic doctrine, because it enables this law to be very\r\neasily understood. If the divisibility of every element has a limit,\r\nnamely the atom, then the atoms of elements are the extreme limits of\r\nall divisibility, and if they differ from each other in their nature,\r\nthe formation of a compound from elementary matter must consist in the\r\naggregation of several different atoms into one whole or system of\r\natoms, now termed _particles or molecules_. As atoms can only combine\r\nin their entire masses, it is evident that not only the law of definite\r\ncomposition, but also that of multiple proportions, must apply to the\r\ncombination of atoms with one another; for one atom of a substance\r\ncan combine with one, two, or three atoms of another substance, or in\r\ngeneral one, two, three atoms of one substance are able to combine\r\nwith one, two, or three atoms of another; this being the essence of\r\nthe law of multiple proportions. Chemical and physical data are very\r\nwell explained by the aid of the atomic theory. The displacement of one\r\nelement by another follows the law of equivalency. In this case one or\r\nseveral atoms of a given element take the place of one or several atoms\r\nof another element in its compounds. The atoms of different substances\r\ncan be mixed together in the same sense as sand can be mixed with clay.\r\nThey do not unite into one whole--_i.e._ there is not a perfect blending\r\nin the one or other case, but only a juxtaposition, a homogeneous whole\r\nbeing formed from individual parts. This is the first and most simple\r\nmethod of applying the atomic theory to the explanation of chemical\r\nphenomena.[33]\r\n\r\n  [31] Leucippus, Democritus, and especially Lucretius, in the classical\r\n       ages, represented matter as made up of atoms--that is, of parts\r\n       incapable of further division. The geometrical impossibility of\r\n       such an admission, as well as the conclusions which were deduced\r\n       by the ancient atomists from their fundamental propositions,\r\n       prevented other philosophers from following them, and the atomic\r\n       doctrine, like very many others, lived, without being ratified\r\n       by fact, in the imaginations of its followers. Between the\r\n       present atomic theory and the doctrine of the above-named ancient\r\n       philosophers there is naturally a remote historical connection,\r\n       as between the doctrine of Pythagoras and Copernicus, but they\r\n       are essentially different. For us the atom is indivisible, not\r\n       in the geometrical abstract sense, but only in a physical and\r\n       chemical sense. It would be better to call the atoms indivisible\r\n       _individuals_. The Greek atom = the Latin individual, both\r\n       according to the etymology and original sense of the words, but\r\n       in course of time these two words have acquired a different\r\n       meaning. The individual is mechanically and geometrically\r\n       divisible, and only indivisible in a special sense. The earth,\r\n       the sun, a man or a fly are individuals, although geometrically\r\n       divisible. Thus the 'atoms' of contemporary science, indivisible\r\n       in a chemical sense, form those units with which we are concerned\r\n       in the investigation of the natural phenomena of matter, just\r\n       as a man is an indivisible unit in the investigation of social\r\n       relations, or as the stars, planets, and luminaries serve as\r\n       units in astronomy. The formation of the vortex hypothesis,\r\n       in which, as we shall afterwards see, atoms are entire whirls\r\n       mechanically complex, although physico-chemically indivisible,\r\n       clearly shows that the scientific men of our time in holding\r\n       to the atomic theory have only borrowed the word and form of\r\n       expression from the ancient philosophers, and not the essence\r\n       of their atomic doctrine. It is erroneous to imagine that the\r\n       contemporary conceptions of the atomists are nothing but the\r\n       repetition of the metaphysical reasonings of the ancients. To\r\n       show the true meaning of the atomism of the ancient philosophers,\r\n       and the profound difference between their points of argument\r\n       and those of contemporary men of science, I cite the following\r\n       fundamental propositions of Democritus (B.C. 470-380) as the best\r\n       expounder of the atomic doctrine of the ancients:--(1) Nothing\r\n       can proceed from nothing, nothing that exists can disappear or\r\n       be destroyed (and hence matter), and every change only consists\r\n       of a combination or separation. (2) Nothing is accidental, there\r\n       is a reason and necessity for everything. (3) All except atoms\r\n       and vacua is reason and not existence. (4) The atoms, which are\r\n       infinite in number and form, constitute the visible universe by\r\n       their motion, impact, and consequent revolving motion. (5) The\r\n       variety of objects depends only upon a difference in the number,\r\n       form, and order of the atoms of which they are formed, and not\r\n       upon a qualitative difference of their atoms, which only act\r\n       upon each other by pressure and impact. (6) The spirit, like\r\n       fire, consists of minute, spherical, smooth, and very mobile and\r\n       all-penetrating atoms, whose motion forms the phenomenon of life.\r\n       These Democritian, chiefly metaphysical, principles of atomism\r\n       are so essentially different from the principles of the present\r\n       atomic doctrine, which is exclusively applied to explaining\r\n       the phenomena of the external world, that it may be useful to\r\n       mention the essence of the atomic propositions of Boscovitch,\r\n       a Slav who lived in the middle of the eighteenth century, and\r\n       who is regarded as the founder of the modern atomic doctrines\r\n       which, however, did not take hold upon the minds of scientific\r\n       men, and were rarely applied prior to Dalton--_i.e._ until the\r\n       beginning of the nineteenth century. The doctrine of Boscovitch\r\n       was enunciated by him in 1758-1764 in his '_Philosophiæ naturalis\r\n       theoria reducta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium_.'\r\n       Boscovitch considers matter to be composed of atoms, and the\r\n       atoms to be the points or centres of forces (just as the stars\r\n       and planets may be considered as points of space), acting between\r\n       bodies and their parts. These forces vary with the distance, so\r\n       that beyond a certain very small distance all atoms, and hence\r\n       also their aggregates, are attracted according to Newton's law,\r\n       but at less distances, there alternate wave-like spheres of\r\n       gradually decreasing attraction and increasing (as the distance\r\n       decreases) repulsion, until at last at a minimum distance only\r\n       the repellent action remains. Atoms, therefore, cannot merge\r\n       into each other. Consequently, the atoms are held at a certain\r\n       distance from each other, and therefore occupy space. Boscovitch\r\n       compares the sphere of repulsion surrounding the atoms to\r\n       the spheres of action of firing of a detachment of soldiers.\r\n       According to his doctrine, atoms are indestructible, do not merge\r\n       into each other, have mass, are everlasting and mobile under the\r\n       action of the forces proper to them. Maxwell rightly calls this\r\n       hypothesis the 'extreme' among those existing to explain matter,\r\n       but many aspects of Boscovitch's doctrine repeat themselves\r\n       in the views of our day, with this essential difference, that\r\n       instead of a mathematical point furnished with the properties of\r\n       mass, the atoms are endowed with a corporality, just as the stars\r\n       and planets are corporal, although in certain aspects of their\r\n       interaction they may be regarded as mathematical points. In my\r\n       opinion, the atomism of our day must first of all be regarded\r\n       merely as a convenient method for the investigation of ponderable\r\n       matter. As a geometrician in reasoning about curves represents\r\n       them as formed of a succession of right lines, because such a\r\n       method enables him to analyse the subject under investigation,\r\n       so the scientific man applies the atomic theory as a method of\r\n       analysing the phenomena of nature. Naturally there are people\r\n       now, as in ancient times, and as there always will be, who apply\r\n       reality to imagination, and therefore there are to be found\r\n       atomists of extreme views; but it is not in their spirit that\r\n       we should acknowledge the great services rendered by the atomic\r\n       doctrine to all science, which, while it has been essentially\r\n       independently developed, is, if it be desired to reduce all\r\n       ideas to the doctrines of the ancients, a union of the ancient\r\n       dynamical and atomic doctrines.\r\n\r\n  [32] Dalton and many of his successors distinguished the atoms of\r\n       elements and compounds, in which they clearly symbolised the\r\n       difference of their opinion from the representations of the\r\n       ancients. Now only the individuals of the elements, indivisible\r\n       by physical and chemical forces, are termed atoms, and the\r\n       individuals of compounds indivisible under physical changes are\r\n       termed molecules; these are divisible into atoms by chemical\r\n       forces.\r\n\r\n  [33] In the present condition of science, either the atomic or the\r\n       dynamical hypothesis is inevitably obliged to admit the existence\r\n       of an invisible and imperceptible motion in matter, without\r\n       which it is impossible to understand either light or heat, or\r\n       gaseous pressure, or any of the mechanical, physical, or chemical\r\n       phenomena. The ancients saw vital motion in animals only, but\r\n       to us the smallest particle of matter, endued with _vis viva_,\r\n       or energy in some degree or other, is incomprehensible without\r\n       self-existent motion. Thus motion has become a conception\r\n       inseparably knit with the conception of matter, and this has\r\n       prepared the ground for the revival of the dynamical hypothesis\r\n       of the constitution of matter. In the atomic theory there has\r\n       arisen that generalising idea by which the world of atoms is\r\n       constructed, like the universe of heavenly bodies, with its\r\n       suns, planets, and meteors, endued with everlasting force of\r\n       motion, forming molecules as the heavenly bodies form systems,\r\n       like the solar system, which molecules are only relatively\r\n       indivisible in the same way as the planets of the solar system\r\n       are inseparable, and stable and lasting as the solar system\r\n       is lasting. Such a representation, without necessitating the\r\n       absolute indivisibility of atoms, expresses all that science can\r\n       require for an hypothetical representation of the constitution\r\n       of matter. In closer proximity to the dynamical hypothesis of\r\n       the constitution of matter is the oft-times revived _vortex\r\n       hypothesis_. Descartes first endeavoured to raise it; Helmholtz\r\n       and Thomson (Lord Kelvin) gave it a fuller and more modern form;\r\n       many scientific men applied it to physics and chemistry. The idea\r\n       of vortex rings serves as the starting point of this hypothesis;\r\n       these are familiar to all as the rings of tobacco smoke, and may\r\n       be artificially obtained by giving a sharp blow to the sides\r\n       of a cardboard box having a circular orifice and filled with\r\n       smoke. Phosphuretted hydrogen, as we shall see later on, when\r\n       bubbling from water always gives very perfect vortex rings in a\r\n       still atmosphere. In such rings it is easy to observe a constant\r\n       circular motion about their axes, and to notice the stability the\r\n       rings possess in their motion of translation. This unchangeable\r\n       mass, endued with a rapid internal motion, is likened to the\r\n       atom. In a medium deprived of friction, such a ring, as is shown\r\n       by theoretical considerations of the subject from a mechanical\r\n       point of view, would be perpetual and unchangeable. The rings\r\n       are capable of grouping together, and in combining, without\r\n       being absolutely indivisible, remain indivisible. The vortex\r\n       hypothesis has been established in our times, but it has not\r\n       been fully developed; its application to chemical phenomena is\r\n       not clear, although not impossible; it does not satisfy a doubt\r\n       in respect to the nature of the space existing between the rings\r\n       (just as it is not clear what exists between atoms, and between\r\n       the planets), neither does it tell us what is the nature of the\r\n       moving substance of the ring, and therefore for the present it\r\n       only presents the germ of an hypothetical conception of the\r\n       constitution of matter; consequently, I consider that it would\r\n       be superfluous to speak of it in greater detail. However, the\r\n       thoughts of investigators are now (and naturally will be in the\r\n       future), as they were in the time of Dalton, often turned to the\r\n       question of the limitation of the mechanical division of matter,\r\n       and the atomists have searched for an answer in the most diverse\r\n       spheres of nature. I select one of the methods attempted, which\r\n       does not in any way refer to chemistry, in order to show how\r\n       closely all the provinces of natural science are bound together.\r\n       Wollaston proposed the investigation of the _atmosphere of the\r\n       heavenly bodies_ as a means for confirming the existence of\r\n       atoms. If the divisibility of matter be infinite, then air must\r\n       extend throughout the entire space of the heavens as it extends\r\n       all over the earth by its elasticity and diffusion. If the\r\n       infinite divisibility of matter be admitted, it is impossible\r\n       that any portion of the whole space of the universe can be\r\n       entirely void of the component parts of our atmosphere. But if\r\n       matter be divisible up to a certain limit only--namely, up to\r\n       the atom--then there _can exist_ a heavenly body void of an\r\n       atmosphere; and if such a body be discovered, it would serve as\r\n       an important factor for the acceptation of the validity of the\r\n       atomic doctrine. The moon has long been considered as such a\r\n       luminary and this circumstance, especially from its proximity to\r\n       the earth, has been cited as the best proof of the validity of\r\n       the atomic doctrine. This proof is apparently (Poisson) deprived\r\n       of some of its force from the possibility of the transformation\r\n       of the component parts of our atmosphere into a solid or liquid\r\n       state at immense heights above the earth's surface, where the\r\n       temperature is exceedingly low; but a series of researches\r\n       (Pouillet) has shown that the temperature of the heavenly\r\n       space is comparatively not so very low, and is attainable by\r\n       experimental means, so that at the low existing pressure the\r\n       liquefaction of the gases of the atmosphere cannot he expected\r\n       even on the moon. Therefore the absence of an atmosphere about\r\n       the moon, if it were not subject to doubt, would be counted as a\r\n       forcible proof of the atomic theory. As a proof of the absence of\r\n       a lunar atmosphere, it is cited that the moon, in its independent\r\n       motion between the stars, when eclipsing a star--that is, when\r\n       passing between the eye and the star--does not show any signs\r\n       of refraction at its edge; the image of the star does not alter\r\n       its position in the heavens on approaching the moon's surface,\r\n       consequently there is no atmosphere on the moon's surface capable\r\n       of refracting the rays of light. Such is the conclusion by which\r\n       the absence of a lunar atmosphere is acknowledged. But this\r\n       conclusion is most feeble, and there are even facts in exact\r\n       contradiction to it, by which the existence of a lunar atmosphere\r\n       may be proved. The entire surface of the moon is covered with a\r\n       number of mountains, having in the majority of cases the conical\r\n       form natural to volcanoes. The volcanic character of the lunar\r\n       mountains was confirmed in October 1866, when a change was\r\n       observed in the form of one of them (the crater Linnea). These\r\n       mountains must be on the edge of the lunar disc. Seen in profile,\r\n       they screen one another and interfere with observations on the\r\n       surface of the moon, so that when looking at the edge of the\r\n       lunar disc we are obliged to make our observations not on the\r\n       moon's surface, but at the summits of the lunar mountains. These\r\n       mountains are higher than those on our earth, and consequently at\r\n       their summits the lunar atmosphere must he exceedingly rarefied\r\n       even if it possess an observable density at the surface. Knowing\r\n       the mass of the moon to be eighty-two times less than the mass\r\n       of the earth, we are able to determine approximately that our\r\n       atmosphere at the moon's surface would be about twenty-eight\r\n       times lighter than it is on the earth, and consequently at the\r\n       very surface of the moon the refraction of light by the lunar\r\n       atmosphere must he very slight, and at the heights of the lunar\r\n       mountains it must be imperceptible, and would be lost within the\r\n       limits of experimental error. Therefore the absence of refraction\r\n       of light at the edge of the moon's disc cannot yet be urged in\r\n       favour of the absence of a lunar atmosphere. There is even a\r\n       series of observations obliging us to admit the existence of\r\n       this atmosphere. These researches are due to Sir John Herschel.\r\n       This is what he writes: 'It has often been remarked that during\r\n       the eclipse of a star by the moon there occurs a peculiar\r\n       optical illusion; it seems as if the star before disappearing\r\n       passed over the edge of the moon and is seen through the lunar\r\n       disc, sometimes for a rather long period of time. I myself have\r\n       observed this phenomenon, and it has been witnessed by perfectly\r\n       trustworthy observers. I ascribe it to optical illusion, but it\r\n       must be admitted that the star might have been seen on the lunar\r\n       disc through some deep ravine on the moon.' Geniller, in Belgium\r\n       (1856), following the opinion of Cassini, Eiler, and others,\r\n       gave an explanation of this phenomenon: he considers it due to\r\n       the refraction of light in the valleys of the lunar mountains\r\n       which occur on the edge of the lunar disc. In fact, although\r\n       these valleys do not probably present the form of straight\r\n       ravines, yet it may sometimes happen that the light of a star\r\n       is so refracted that its image might he seen, notwithstanding\r\n       the absence of a direct path for the light-rays. He then goes\r\n       on to remark that the density of the lunar atmosphere must be\r\n       variable in different parts, owing to the very long nights on\r\n       the moon. On the dark, or non-illuminated portion, owing to\r\n       these long nights, which last thirteen of our days and nights,\r\n       there must be excessive cold, and hence a denser atmosphere,\r\n       while, on the contrary, on the illuminated portion the atmosphere\r\n       must be much more rarefied. This variation in the temperature\r\n       of the different parts of the moon's surface explains also the\r\n       absence of clouds, notwithstanding the possible presence of air\r\n       and aqueous vapour, on the visible portion of the moon. The\r\n       presence of an atmosphere round the sun and planets, judging from\r\n       astronomical observations, may be considered as fully proved. On\r\n       Jupiter and Mars even bands of clouds may be distinguished. Thus\r\n       the atomic doctrine, admitting a finite mechanical divisibility\r\n       only, must he, as yet at least, only accepted as a means, similar\r\n       to that means which a mathematician employs when he breaks up\r\n       a continuous curvilinear line into a number of straight lines.\r\n       There is a simplicity of representation in atoms, but there is no\r\n       absolute necessity to have recourse to them. The conception of\r\n       the individuality of the parts of matter exhibited in chemical\r\n       elements only is necessary and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nA certain number of atoms _n_ of an element A in combining with several\r\natoms _m_ of another element B give a compound A_{_n_} B_{_m_}, each\r\nmolecule of which will contain the atoms of the elements A and B\r\nin this ratio, and therefore the compound will present a _definite\r\ncomposition_, expressed by the formula A_{_n_}B_{_m_}, where A and B\r\nare the weights of the atoms and _n_ and _m_ their relative number. If\r\nthe same elements A and B, in addition to A_{_n_}B_{_m_}, also yield\r\nanother compound A_{_r_}B_{_q_}, then by expressing the composition of\r\nthe first compound by A_{_nr_}B_{_mr_} (and this is the same composition\r\nas A_{_n_}B_{_m_}), and of the second compound by A_{_rn_}B_{_qn_},\r\nwe have the law of multiple proportions, because for a given quantity\r\nof the first element, A_{_rn_}, there occur quantities of the second\r\nelement bearing the same ratio to each other as _mr_ is to _qn_; and\r\nas _m_, _r_, _q_, and _n_ are whole numbers, their products are also\r\nwhole numbers, and this is expressed by the law of multiple proportion.\r\nConsequently the atomic theory is in accordance with and evokes\r\nthe first laws of definite chemical compounds: the law of definite\r\ncomposition and the law of multiple proportions.\r\n\r\nSo, also, is the relation of the atomic theory to the third law of\r\ndefinite chemical compounds, the _law of reciprocal combining weights_,\r\nwhich is as follows:--If a certain weight of a substance C combine with\r\na weight _a_ of a substance A, and with a weight _b_ of a substance B,\r\nthen, also, the substances A and B will combine together in quantities\r\n_a_ and _b_ (or in multiples of them). This should be the case from\r\nthe conception of atoms. Let A, B, and C be the weights of the atoms\r\nof the three substances, and for simplicity of reasoning suppose that\r\ncombination takes place between single atoms. It is evident that if\r\nthe substance gives AC and BC, then the substances A and B will give a\r\ncompound AB, or their multiple, A_{_n_}B_{_m_}. And so it is in reality\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nSulphur combines with hydrogen and with oxygen. Sulphuretted hydrogen\r\ncontains thirty-two parts by weight of sulphur to two parts by weight\r\nof hydrogen; this is expressed by the formula H_{2}S. Sulphur dioxide,\r\nSO_{2}, contains thirty-two parts of sulphur and thirty-two parts of\r\noxygen, and therefore we conclude, from the law of combining weights,\r\nthat oxygen and hydrogen will combine in the proportion of two parts\r\nof hydrogen and thirty-two parts of oxygen, or multiple numbers of\r\nthem. And we have seen this to be the case. Hydrogen peroxide contains\r\nthirty-two parts of oxygen, and water sixteen parts, to two parts\r\nof hydrogen; and so it is in all other cases. This consequence of\r\nthe atomic theory is in accordance with nature, with the results of\r\nanalysis, and is one of the most important laws of chemistry. It is\r\na law, because it indicates the _relation between_ the weights of\r\nsubstances entering into chemical combination. Further, it is an\r\neminently exact law, and not an approximate one. The law of combining\r\nweights is a law of nature, and by no means an hypothesis, for even\r\nif the entire theory of atoms be refuted, still the laws of multiple\r\nproportions and of combining weights will remain, inasmuch as they deal\r\nwith facts. They may be guessed at from the sense of the atomic theory,\r\nand historically the law of combining weights is intimately connected\r\nwith this theory; but they are not identical, but only connected, with\r\nit. The law of combining weights is formulated with great ease, and is\r\nan immediate consequence of the atomic theory; without it, it is even\r\ndifficult to understand. Data for its evolution existed previously, but\r\nit was not formulated until those data were interpreted by the atomic\r\ntheory, an hypothesis which up to the present time has contradicted\r\nneither experiment nor fact, and is useful and of general application.\r\nSuch is the nature of hypotheses. They are indispensable to science;\r\nthey bestow an order and simplicity which are difficultly attainable\r\nwithout their aid. The whole history of science is a proof of this.\r\nAnd therefore it may be truly said that it is better to hold to an\r\nhypothesis which may afterwards prove untrue than to have none at all.\r\nHypotheses facilitate scientific work and render it consistent. In the\r\nsearch for truth, like the plough of the husbandman, they help forward\r\nthe work of the labourer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                            NITROGEN AND AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nGaseous _nitrogen_ forms about four-fifths (by volume) of the\r\natmosphere; consequently the air contains an exceedingly large\r\nmass of it. Whilst entering in so considerable a quantity into the\r\ncomposition of air, nitrogen does not seem to play any active part in\r\nthe atmosphere, the chemical action of which is mainly dependent on the\r\noxygen it contains. But this is not an entirely correct idea, because\r\nanimal life cannot exist in pure oxygen, in which animals pass into an\r\nabnormal state and die; and the nitrogen of the air, although slowly,\r\nforms diverse compounds, many of which play a most important part in\r\nnature, especially in the life of organisms. However, neither plants[1]\r\nnor animals directly absorb the nitrogen of the air, but take it up from\r\nalready prepared nitrogenous compounds; further, plants are nourished by\r\nthe nitrogenous substances contained in the soil and water, and animals\r\nby the nitrogenous substances contained in plants and in other animals.\r\nAtmospheric electricity is capable of aiding the passage of gaseous\r\nnitrogen into nitrogenous compounds, as we shall afterwards see, and\r\nthe resultant substances are carried to the soil by rain, where they\r\nserve for the nourishment of plants. Plentiful harvests, fine crops of\r\nhay, vigorous growth of trees--other conditions being equal--are only\r\nobtained when the soil contains _ready prepared nitrogenous compounds_,\r\nconsisting either of those which occur in air and water, or of the\r\nresidues of the decomposition of other plants or animals (as in manure).\r\nThe nitrogenous substances contained in animals have their origin in\r\nthose substances which are formed in plants. Thus the nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere is the origin of all the nitrogenous substances occurring in\r\nanimals and plants, although not directly so, but after first combining\r\nwith the other elements of air.\r\n\r\n  [1] See Note 15 bis.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous compounds which enter into the composition of plants and\r\nanimals are of primary importance; no vegetable or animal cell--that\r\nis, the elementary form of organism--exists without containing a\r\nnitrogenous substance, and moreover organic life manifests itself\r\nprimarily in these nitrogenous substances. The germs, seeds, and\r\nthose parts by which cells multiply themselves abound in nitrogenous\r\nsubstances; the sum total of the phenomena which are proper to organisms\r\ndepend primarily on the chemical properties of the nitrogenous\r\nsubstances which enter into their composition. It will be sufficient,\r\nfor instance, to point out the fact that vegetable and animal organisms,\r\nclearly distinguishable as such, are characterised by a different degree\r\nof energy in their nature, and at the same time by a difference in the\r\namount of nitrogenous substances they contain. In plants, which compared\r\nwith animals possess but little activity, being incapable of independent\r\nmovement, &c., the amount of nitrogen is very much less than in animals,\r\nwhose tissues are almost exclusively formed of nitrogenous substances.\r\nIt is remarkable that the nitrogenous parts of plants, chiefly of the\r\nlower orders, sometimes present both forms and properties which approach\r\nto those of animal organisms; for example, the zoospores of sea-weeds,\r\nor those parts by means of which the latter multiply themselves. These\r\nzoospores on leaving the sea-weed in many respects resemble the lower\r\norders of animal life, having, like the latter, the property of moving.\r\nThey also approach the animal kingdom in their composition, their outer\r\ncoating containing nitrogenous matter. Directly the zoospore becomes\r\ncovered with that non-nitrogenous or cellular coating which is proper to\r\nall the ordinary cells of plants, it loses all resemblance to an animal\r\norganism and becomes a small plant. It may be thought from this that the\r\ncause of the difference in the vital processes of animals and plants\r\nis the different amount of nitrogenous substances they contain. The\r\nnitrogenous substances which occur in plants and animals appertain to a\r\nseries of exceedingly complex and very changeable chemical compounds;\r\ntheir elementary composition alone shows this; besides nitrogen, they\r\ncontain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. Being distinguished by a\r\nvery great instability under many conditions in which other compounds\r\nremain unchanged, these substances are fitted for those perpetual\r\nchanges which form the first condition of vital activity. These complex\r\nand changeable nitrogenous substances of the organism are called\r\n_proteïd substances_. The white of eggs is a familiar example of such a\r\nsubstance. They are also contained in the flesh of animals, the curdy\r\nelements of milk, the glutinous matter of wheaten flour, or so-called\r\ngluten, which forms the chief component of macaroni, &c.\r\n\r\nNitrogen occurs in the earth's crust, in compounds either forming the\r\nremains of plants and animals, or derived from the nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere as a consequence of its combination with the other component\r\nparts of the air. It is not found in other forms in the earth's crust;\r\nso that nitrogen must be considered, in contradistinction to oxygen,\r\nas an element which is purely superficial, and does not extend to the\r\ndepths of the earth.[1 bis]\r\n\r\n  [1 bis] The reason why there are no other nitrogenous substances within\r\n      the earth's mass beyond those which have come there with the\r\n      remains of organisms, and from the air with rain-water, must be\r\n      looked for in two circumstances. In the first place, in the\r\n      instability of many nitrogenous compounds, which are liable to\r\n      break up with the formation of gaseous nitrogen; and in the second\r\n      place in the fact that the salts of nitric acid, forming the\r\n      product of the action of air on many nitrogenous and especially\r\n      organic compounds, are very soluble in water, and on penetrating\r\n      into the depths of the earth (with water) give up their oxygen. The\r\n      result of the changes of the nitrogenous organic substances which\r\n      fall into the earth is without doubt frequently, if not invariably,\r\n      the formation of gaseous nitrogen. Thus the gas evolved from coal\r\n      always contains much nitrogen (together with marsh gas, carbonic\r\n      anhydride, and other gases).\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen is liberated_ in a free state in the decomposition of the\r\n_nitrogenous organic substances_ entering into the composition of\r\norganisms--for instance, on their combustion. All organic substances\r\nburn when heated to redness with oxygen (or substances readily yielding\r\nit, such as oxide of copper); the oxygen combines with the carbon,\r\nsulphur, and hydrogen, and the nitrogen is evolved in a free state,\r\nbecause at a high temperature it does not form any stable compound,\r\nbut remains uncombined. Carbonic anhydride and water are formed from\r\nthe carbon and hydrogen respectively, and therefore to obtain pure\r\nnitrogen it is necessary to remove the carbonic anhydride from the\r\ngaseous products obtained. This may be done very easily by the action of\r\nalkalis--for instance, caustic soda. The amount of nitrogen in organic\r\nsubstances is determined by a method founded on this.\r\n\r\nIt is also very easy to obtain _nitrogen from air_, because oxygen\r\ncombines with many substances. Either phosphorus or metallic copper is\r\nusually employed for removing the oxygen from air, but, naturally, a\r\nnumber of other substances may also be used. If a small saucer on which\r\na piece of phosphorus is laid be placed on a cork floating on water, and\r\nthe phosphorus be lighted, and the whole covered with a glass bell jar,\r\nthen the air under the jar will be deprived of its oxygen, and nitrogen\r\nonly will remain, owing to which, on cooling, the water will rise to\r\na certain extent in the bell jar. The same object (procuring nitrogen\r\nfrom air) is attained much more conveniently and perfectly by passing\r\nair through a red-hot tube containing copper filings. At a red heat,\r\nmetallic copper combines with oxygen and gives a black powder of copper\r\noxide. If the layer of copper be sufficiently long and the current of\r\nair slow, all the oxygen will be absorbed, and nitrogen alone will pass\r\nfrom the tube.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Copper (best as turnings, which present a large surface) absorbs\r\n      oxygen, forming CuO, at the ordinary temperature in the presence\r\n      of solutions of acids, or, better still, in the presence of a\r\n      solution of ammonia, when it forms a bluish-violet solution of\r\n      oxide of copper in ammonia. Nitrogen is very easily procured by\r\n      this method. A flask filled with copper turnings is closed with a\r\n      cork furnished with a funnel and stopcock. A solution of ammonia\r\n      is poured into the funnel, and caused to drop slowly upon the\r\n      copper. If at the same time a current of air be slowly passed\r\n      through the flask (from a gasholder), then all the oxygen will\r\n      be absorbed from it and the nitrogen will pass from the flask.\r\n      It should be washed with water to retain any ammonia that may be\r\n      carried off with it.\r\n\r\nNitrogen may also be procured from many of its _compounds with oxygen[3]\r\nand hydrogen_,[4] but the best fitted for this purpose is a saline\r\nmixture containing, on the one hand, a compound of nitrogen with oxygen,\r\ntermed nitrous anhydride, N_{2}O_{3}, and on the other hand, ammonia,\r\nNH_{3}--that is, a compound of nitrogen with hydrogen. By heating such a\r\nmixture, the oxygen of the nitrous anhydride combines with the hydrogen\r\nof the ammonia, forming water, and gaseous nitrogen is evolved, 2NH_{3}\r\n+ N_{2}O_{3} = 3H_{2}O + N_{4}. Nitrogen is procured by this method in\r\nthe following manner:--A solution of caustic potash is saturated with\r\nnitrous anhydride, by which means potassium nitrite is formed. On the\r\nother hand, a solution of hydrochloric acid saturated with ammonia is\r\nprepared; a saline substance called sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, is thus\r\nformed in the solution. The two solutions thus prepared are mixed\r\ntogether and heated. Reaction takes place according to the equation\r\nKNO_{2} + NH_{4}Cl = KCl + 2H_{2}O + N_{2}. This reaction proceeds in\r\nvirtue of the fact that potassium nitrite and ammonium chloride are\r\nsalts which, on interchanging their metals, give potassium chloride\r\nand ammonium nitrite, NH_{4}NO_{2}, which breaks up into water and\r\nnitrogen. This reaction does not take place without the aid of heat,\r\nbut it proceeds very easily at a moderate temperature. Of the resultant\r\nsubstances, the nitrogen only is gaseous. Pure nitrogen may be obtained\r\nby drying the resultant gas and passing it through a solution of\r\nsulphuric acid (to absorb a certain quantity of ammonia which is evolved\r\nin the reaction).[4 bis]\r\n\r\n  [3] The oxygen compounds of nitrogen (for example, N_{2}O, NO, NO_{2})\r\n      are decomposed at a red heat by themselves, and under the action\r\n      of red-hot copper, iron, sodium, &c., they give up their oxygen\r\n      to the metals, leaving the nitrogen free. According to Meyer and\r\n      Langer (1885), nitrous oxide, N_{2}O, decomposes below 900°,\r\n      although not completely.\r\n\r\n  [4] Chlorine and bromine (in excess), as well as bleaching powder\r\n      (hypochlorites), take up the hydrogen from ammonia, NH_{3},\r\n      leaving nitrogen. Nitrogen is best procured from ammonia by the\r\n      action of a solution of sodium hypobromite on solid sal-ammoniac.\r\n\r\n  [4 bis] Lord Rayleigh in 1894, when determining the weight of a volume\r\n      of carefully purified nitrogen by weighing it in one and the same\r\n      globe, found that the gas obtained from air, by the action of\r\n      incandescent copper (or iron or by removing the oxygen by ferrous\r\n      oxide) was always 1/200 heavier than the nitrogen obtained from its\r\n      compounds, for instance, from the oxide or suboxide of nitrogen,\r\n      decomposed by incandescent pulverulent iron or from the ammonia\r\n      salt of nitrous acid. For the nitrogen procured from air, he\r\n      obtained, at 0° and 760·4 mm. pressure, a weight = 2·310 grms.,\r\n      while for the nitrogen obtained from its compounds, 2·299 grms.\r\n      This difference of about 1/200 could not be explained by the\r\n      nitrogen not having been well purified, or by inaccuracy of\r\n      experiment, and was the means for the remarkable discovery of the\r\n      presence of a heavy gas in air, which will be mentioned in Note\r\n      16 bis.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is a gaseous substance which does not differ much in physical\r\nproperties from air; its density, referred to hydrogen, is approximately\r\nequal to 14--that is, it is slightly lighter than air, its density\r\nreferred to air being 0·972; one litre of nitrogen weighs 1·257 gram.\r\nNitrogen mixed with oxygen, which is slightly heavier than air, forms\r\nair. It is a gas which, like oxygen and hydrogen, is liquefied with\r\ndifficulty, and is but little soluble in water and other liquids. Its\r\nabsolute boiling point[5] is about -140°; above this temperature it is\r\nnot liquefiable by pressure, and at lower temperatures it remains a\r\ngas at a pressure of 50 atmospheres. Liquid nitrogen boils at -193°,\r\nso that it may be employed as a source of great cold. At about -203°,\r\nin vaporising under a decrease of pressure, nitrogen solidifies into\r\na colourless snow-like mass. Nitrogen does not burn,[5 bis] does not\r\nsupport combustion, is not absorbed by any of the reagents used in gas\r\nanalysis, at least at the ordinary temperature--in a word, it presents\r\na whole series of negative chemical properties; this is expressed by\r\nsaying that this element has no energy for combination. Although it\r\nis capable of forming compounds both with oxygen and hydrogen as well\r\nas with carbon, yet these compounds are only formed under particular\r\ncircumstances, to which we will directly turn our attention. At a red\r\nheat nitrogen combines with boron, titanium, and silicon, barium,\r\nmagnesium, &c., forming very stable nitrogenous compounds,[6] whose\r\nproperties are entirely different from those of nitrogen with hydrogen,\r\noxygen and carbon. However, the combination of nitrogen with carbon,\r\nalthough it does not take place directly between the elements at a\r\nred heat, yet proceeds with comparative ease by heating a mixture of\r\ncharcoal with an alkaline carbonate, especially potassium carbonate or\r\nbarium carbonate, to redness, carbo-nitrides or cyanides of the metals\r\nbeing formed; for instance, K_{2}CO_{3} + 4C + N_{2} = 2KCN + 3CO.[7]\r\n\r\n  [5] See Chapter II. Note 29.\r\n\r\n  [5 bis] See Note 11 bis.\r\n\r\n  [6] The combination of boron with nitrogen is accompanied by the\r\n      evolution of sufficient heat to raise the mass to redness;\r\n      titanium combines so easily with nitrogen that it is difficult\r\n      to obtain it free from that element; magnesium easily absorbs\r\n      nitrogen at a red heat. It is a remarkable and instructive fact\r\n      that these compounds of nitrogen are very stable and non-volatile.\r\n      Carbon (C = 12) with nitrogen gives cyanogen, C_{2}N_{2}, which\r\n      is gaseous and very unstable, and whose molecule is not large,\r\n      whilst boron (B = 11) forms a nitrogenous compound which is solid,\r\n      non-volatile, and very stable. Its composition, BN, is similar\r\n      to that of cyanogen, but its molecular weight, B_{n}N_{n}, is\r\n      probably greater. Its composition, like that of N_{2}Mg_{3},\r\n      NNa_{3}, N_{2}Hg_{3} and of many of the metallic nitrides,\r\n      corresponds to ammonia with the substitution of all its hydrogen\r\n      by a metal. In my opinion, a detailed study of the transformations\r\n      of the nitrides now known, should lead to the discovery of many\r\n      facts in the history of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  [7] This reaction, so far as is known, does not proceed beyond a\r\n      certain limit, probably because cyanogen, CN, itself breaks up\r\n      into carbon and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is found with oxygen in the air, but they do not readily\r\ncombine. Cavendish, however, in the last century, showed that _nitrogen\r\ncombines with oxygen under the influence of a series of electric\r\nsparks_. Electric sparks in passing through a moist[8] mixture\r\nof nitrogen and oxygen cause these elements to combine, forming\r\nreddish-brown fumes of oxides of nitrogen,[9] which form nitric\r\nacid,[10] NHO_{3}. The presence of the latter is easily recognised,\r\nnot only from its reddening litmus paper, but also from its acting as\r\na powerful oxidiser even of mercury. Conditions similar to these occur\r\nin nature, during a thunderstorm or in other electrical discharges\r\nwhich take place in the atmosphere; whence it may be taken for granted\r\nthat air and rain-water always contain traces of nitric and nitrous\r\nacids.[11] Besides which Crookes (1892) showed that under certain\r\ncircumstances and when electricity of high potential[11 bis] passes\r\nthrough the air, the combination of nitrogen with oxygen is accompanied\r\nby the formation of a true flame. This was also observed previously\r\n(1880) during the passage of electrical discharges through the air.\r\n\r\n  [8] Frémy and Becquerel took dry air, and observed the formation of\r\n      brown vapours of oxides of nitrogen on the passage of sparks.\r\n\r\n  [9] If a mixture of one volume of nitrogen and fourteen volumes of\r\n      hydrogen be burnt, then water and a considerable quantity of\r\n      nitric acid are formed. It may be partly due to this that a\r\n      certain quantity of nitric acid is produced in the slow oxidation\r\n      of nitrogenous substances in an excess of air. This is especially\r\n      facilitated by the presence of an alkali with which the nitric\r\n      acid formed can combine. If a galvanic current be passed through\r\n      water containing the nitrogen and oxygen of the air in solution,\r\n      then the hydrogen and oxygen set free combine with the nitrogen,\r\n      forming ammonia and nitric acid.\r\n\r\n      When copper is oxidised at the expense of the air at the ordinary\r\n      temperature in the presence of ammonia, oxygen is absorbed, not\r\n      only for combination with the copper, but also for the formation\r\n      of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n      The combination of nitrogen with oxygen, even, for example, by\r\n      the action of electric sparks, is not accompanied by an explosion\r\n      or rapid combination, as in the action of a spark on a mixture\r\n      of oxygen and hydrogen. This is explained by the fact that heat\r\n      is not evolved in the combination of nitrogen with oxygen, but\r\n      is absorbed--an expenditure of energy is required, there is no\r\n      evolution of energy. In fact, there will not be the transmission\r\n      of heat from particle to particle which occurs in the explosion\r\n      of detonating gas. Each spark will aid the formation of a certain\r\n      quantity of the compound of oxygen and nitrogen, but will not\r\n      excite the same in the neighbouring particles. In other words, the\r\n      combination of hydrogen with oxygen is an exothermal reaction, and\r\n      the combination of nitrogen with oxygen an endothermal reaction.\r\n\r\n      A condition particularly favourable for the oxidation of nitrogen\r\n      is the explosion of detonating gas and air if the former be\r\n      _in excess_. If a mixture of two volumes of detonating gas and\r\n      one volume of air be exploded, then one-tenth of the air is\r\n      converted into nitric acid, and consequently after the explosion\r\n      has taken place there remain only nine-tenths of the volume of\r\n      air originally taken. If a large proportion of air be taken--for\r\n      instance, four volumes of air to two volumes of detonating\r\n      gas--then the temperature of the explosion is lowered, the\r\n      volume of air taken remains unchanged, and no nitric acid is\r\n      formed. This gives a rule to be observed in making use of the\r\n      eudiometer--namely that to weaken the force of the explosion\r\n      not less than an equal volume of air should be added to the\r\n      explosive mixture. On the other hand a large excess must not be\r\n      taken as no explosion would then ensue (_see_ Chapter III. Note\r\n      34). Probably in the future means will be found for obtaining\r\n      compounds of nitrogen on a large industrial scale by the aid of\r\n      electric discharges, and by making use of the inexhaustible mass\r\n      of nitrogen in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  [10] In reality nitric oxide, NO, is first formed, but with oxygen and\r\n       water it gives (brown fumes) nitrous anhydride, which, as we\r\n       shall afterwards learn, in the presence of water and oxygen gives\r\n       nitric acid.\r\n\r\n  [11] The nitric acid contained in the soil, river water (Chapter I.,\r\n       Note 2), wells, &c., proceeds (like carbonic anhydride) from the\r\n       oxidation of organic compounds which have fallen into water,\r\n       soil, &c.\r\n\r\n  [11 bis] Crookes employed a current of 15 ampères and 65 volts, and\r\n       passed it through an induction coil with 330 vibrations per\r\n       second, and obtained a flame between the poles placed at a\r\n       distance of 46 mm. which after the appearance of the arc and flame\r\n       could be increased to 200 mm. A platinum wire fused in the flame.\r\n\r\nFurther observations showed that under the influence of electrical\r\ndischarges,[12] silent as well as with sparks, nitrogen is able to enter\r\ninto many reactions with hydrogen and with many hydrocarbons; although\r\nthese reactions cannot be effected by exposure to a red heat. Thus,\r\nfor instance, a series of electric sparks passed through a mixture of\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen causes them to combine and _form ammonia_[13] or\r\nnitrogen hydride, NH_{3}, composed of one volume of nitrogen and three\r\nvolumes of hydrogen. This combination is limited to the formation of\r\n6 per cent. of ammonia, because ammonia is decomposed, although not\r\nentirely (94/100) by electric sparks. This signifies that under the\r\ninfluence of an electrical discharge the reaction NH_{3} = N + 3H is\r\nreversible, consequently it is a dissociation, and in it a state of\r\nequilibrium is arrived at. The equilibrium may be destroyed by the\r\naddition of gaseous hydrochloric acid, HCl, because with ammonia it\r\nforms a solid saline compound, sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, which (being\r\nformed from a gaseous mixture of 3H, N, and HCl) fixes the ammonia.\r\nThe remaining mass of nitrogen and hydrogen, under the action of the\r\nsparks, again forms ammonia, and in this manner _solid sal-ammoniac is\r\nobtained to the end by the action of a series of electric sparks on a\r\nmixture of gaseous_ N, H_{3}, _and_ HCl.[14] Berthelot (1876) showed\r\nthat under the action of a silent discharge many non-nitrogenous organic\r\nsubstances (benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, cellulose in the form of paper, resin,\r\nglucose, C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, and others) absorb nitrogen and form complex\r\nnitrogenous compounds, which are capable, like albuminous substances, of\r\nevolving their nitrogen as ammonia when heated with alkalis.[15]\r\n\r\n  [12] This property of nitrogen, which under normal conditions is\r\n       inactive, leads to the idea that under the influence of an\r\n       electric discharge gaseous nitrogen changes in its properties;\r\n       if not permanently like oxygen (electrolysed oxygen or ozone\r\n       does not react on nitrogen, according to Berthelot), it may be\r\n       temporarily at the moment of the action of the discharge, just\r\n       as some substances under the action of heat are permanently\r\n       affected (that is, when once changed remain so--for instance,\r\n       white phosphorus passes into red, &c.), whilst others are only\r\n       temporarily altered (the dissociation of S_{6} into S_{2} or\r\n       of sal-ammoniac into ammonia and hydrochloric acid). Such a\r\n       proposition is favoured by the fact that nitrogen gives two kinds\r\n       of spectra, with which we shall afterwards become acquainted. It\r\n       may be that the molecules N_{2} then give less complex molecules,\r\n       N containing one atom, or form a complex molecule N_{3}, like\r\n       oxygen in passing into ozone. Probably under a silent discharge\r\n       the molecules of oxygen, O_{2}, are partly decomposed and the\r\n       individual atoms O combine with O_{2}, forming ozone, O_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [13] This reaction, discovered by Chabrié and investigated by Thénard,\r\n       was only rightly understood when Deville applied the principles\r\n       of dissociation to it.\r\n\r\n  [14] The action of nitrogen on acetylene (Berthelot) resembles this\r\n       reaction. A mixture of these gases under the influence of a\r\n       silent discharge gives hydrocyanic acid, C_{2}H_{2} + N_{2} =\r\n       2CNH. This reaction cannot proceed beyond a certain limit because\r\n       it is reversible.\r\n\r\n  [15] Berthelot successfully employed electricity of even feeble\r\n       potential in these experiments, which fact led him to think that\r\n       in nature, where the action of electricity takes place very\r\n       frequently, a part of the complex nitrogenous substances may\r\n       proceed from the gaseous nitrogen of the air by this method.\r\n\r\n       As the nitrogenous substances of organisms play a very important\r\n       part in them (organic life cannot exist without them), and as\r\n       the nitrogenous substances introduced into the soil are capable\r\n       of invigorating its crops (of course in the presence of the\r\n       other nourishing principles required by plants), the question\r\n       of the means of converting the atmospheric nitrogen into the\r\n       nitrogenous compounds of the soil, or into _assimilable nitrogen_\r\n       capable of being absorbed by plants and of forming complex\r\n       (albuminous) substances in them, is one of great theoretical and\r\n       practical interest. The artificial (technical) conversion of the\r\n       atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogenous compounds, notwithstanding\r\n       repeated attempts, cannot yet be considered as fulfilled in a\r\n       practical remunerative manner although its possibility is already\r\n       evident. Electricity will probably aid in solving this very\r\n       important practical problem. When the theoretical side of the\r\n       question is further advanced, then without doubt an advantageous\r\n       means will be found for the manufacture of nitrogenous substances\r\n       from the nitrogen of the air; and this is needed, before all,\r\n       for the agriculturist, to whom nitrogenous fertilisers form an\r\n       expensive item, and are more important than all other manures.\r\n\r\n       One thousand tons of farmyard manure do not generally contain\r\n       more than four tons of nitrogen in the form of complex\r\n       nitrogenous substances, and this amount of nitrogen is contained\r\n       in twenty tons of ammonium sulphate, therefore the effect of\r\n       a mass of farmyard manure in respect to the introduction of\r\n       nitrogen may be produced by small quantities of artificial\r\n       nitrogenous fertilisers (_see_ Note 15 bis).\r\n\r\nBy such indirect methods does the gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere\r\nyield its primary compounds, in which form it enters into plants, and\r\nis elaborated in them into complex albuminous substances.[15 bis] But,\r\nstarting from a given compound of nitrogen with hydrogen or oxygen,\r\nwe may, without the aid of organisms, obtain, as will afterwards be\r\npartially indicated, most diverse and complex nitrogenous substances,\r\nwhich cannot by any means be formed directly from gaseous nitrogen. In\r\nthis we see an example not only of the difference between an element in\r\nthe free state and an intrinsic element, but also of those circuitous\r\nor _indirect methods_ by which substances are formed in nature. The\r\ndiscovery, prognostication, and, in general, the study of such indirect\r\nmethods of the preparation and formation of substances forms one of the\r\nexisting problems of chemistry. From the fact that A does not act at all\r\non B, it must not be concluded that a compound AB is not to be formed.\r\nThe substances A and B contain atoms which occur in AB, but their state\r\nor the nature of their motion may not be at all that which is required\r\nfor the formation of AB, and in this substance the chemical state of\r\nthe elements may be as different as the state of the atoms of oxygen in\r\nozone and in water. Thus free nitrogen is inactive; but in its compounds\r\nit very easily enters into changes and is distinguished by great\r\nactivity. An acquaintance with the compounds of nitrogen confirms this.\r\nBut, before entering on this subject, let us consider air as a mass\r\ncontaining free nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  [15 bis] Although the numerous, and as far as possible accurate and\r\n       varied researches made in the physiology of plants have proved\r\n       that the higher forms of plants are not capable of directly\r\n       absorbing the nitrogen of the atmosphere and converting it into\r\n       complex albuminous substances, still it has been long and\r\n       repeatedly observed that the amount of nitrogenous substances in\r\n       the soil is increased by the cultivation of plants of the bean\r\n       (leguminous) family such as pea, acacia, &c. A closer study of\r\n       these plants has shown that this is connected with the formation\r\n       of peculiar nodular swellings in their roots caused by the growth\r\n       of peculiar micro-organisms (bacteria) which cohabit the soil with\r\n       the roots, and are capable of absorbing nitrogen from the air,\r\n       _i.e._ of converting it into assimilated nitrogen. This branch of\r\n       plant physiology, which forms another proof of the important part\r\n       played by micro-organisms in nature, cannot be discussed in this\r\n       work, but it should be mentioned, since it is of great theoretical\r\n       and practical interest, and, moreover, phenomena of this kind,\r\n       which have recently been discovered, promise to explain, to some\r\n       extent at least, certain of the complex problems concerning the\r\n       development of life on the earth.\r\n\r\nJudging from what has been already stated, it will be evident that\r\n_atmospheric air_[16] contains a mixture of several gases and vapours.\r\nSome of them are met with in it in nearly constant proportions, whilst\r\nothers, on the contrary, are very variable in their amount. The chief\r\ncomponent parts of air, placed in the order of their relative amounts,\r\nare the following: nitrogen,[16 bis] oxygen, aqueous vapour, carbonic\r\nanhydride, nitric acid, salts of ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, and also\r\nozone, hydrogen peroxide, and complex organic nitrogenous substances.\r\nBesides these, air generally contains water, as spray, drops, and snow,\r\nand particles of solids, perhaps of cosmic origin in certain instances,\r\nbut in the majority of cases proceeding from the mechanical translation\r\nof solid particles from one locality to another by the wind. These\r\nsmall solid and liquid particles (having a large surface in proportion\r\nto their weight) are suspended in air as solid matter is suspended in\r\nturbid water; they often settle on the surface of the earth, but the\r\nair is never entirely free from them because they are never in a state\r\nof complete rest. Then, air not unfrequently contains incidental traces\r\nof various substances as everyone knows by experience. These incidental\r\nsubstances sometimes belong to the order of those which act injuriously,\r\nthe germs of lower organisms--for instance of moulds--and the class of\r\ncarriers of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n  [16] Under the name of atmospheric air the chemist and physicist\r\n       understand ordinary air containing nitrogen and oxygen only,\r\n       notwithstanding that the other component parts of air have a very\r\n       important influence on the living matter of the earth's surface.\r\n       That air is so represented in science is based on the fact that\r\n       only the two components above-named are met with in air in a\r\n       constant quantity, whilst the others are variable. The solid\r\n       impurities may be separated from air required for chemical or\r\n       physical research by simple filtration through a long layer of\r\n       cotton-wool placed in a tube. Organic impurities are removed by\r\n       passing the air through a solution of potassium permanganate. The\r\n       carbonic anhydride contained in air is absorbed by alkalis--best\r\n       of all, soda-lime, which in a dry state in porous lumps absorbs\r\n       it with exceeding rapidity and completeness. Aqueous vapour\r\n       is removed by passing the air over calcium chloride, strong\r\n       sulphuric acid, or phosphoric anhydride. Air thus purified is\r\n       accepted as containing only nitrogen and oxygen, although in\r\n       reality it still contains a certain quantity of hydrogen and\r\n       hydrocarbons, from which it may be purified by passing over\r\n       copper oxide heated to redness. The copper oxide then oxidises\r\n       the hydrogen and hydrocarbons--it burns them, forming water and\r\n       carbonic anhydride, which may be removed as above described. When\r\n       it is said that in the determination of the density of gases the\r\n       weight of air is taken as unity, it is understood to be such air,\r\n       containing only nitrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [16 bis] Thanks to the remarkable discovery made in the summer of 1894\r\n       by Lord Rayleigh and Prof. Ramsay, the well-known component\r\n       elements of air must now he supplemented by 1 p.c. (by volume) of\r\n       a heavy gas (density about 19, H = 1), inactive like nitrogen,\r\n       which was discovered in the researches made by Lord Rayleigh on\r\n       the density of nitrogen as mentioned in note 4 bis. Up to the\r\n       present time this gas has been always determined together with\r\n       nitrogen, because it combines with neither the hydrogen in the\r\n       eudiometer nor with the copper in the gravimetric method of\r\n       determining the composition of air, and therefore has always\r\n       remained with the nitrogen. It has been possible to separate it\r\n       from nitrogen since magnesium absorbs nitrogen at a red heat,\r\n       while this gas remains unabsorbed, and was found to have a density\r\n       nearly one and a half time greater than that of nitrogen (is it\r\n       not a polymer of nitrogen, N_{3}?). It is now known also that this\r\n       gas gives a luminous spectrum, which contains the bright blue line\r\n       observed in the spectrum of nitrogen. Owing to the fact that it is\r\n       an exceedingly inert substance, even more so than nitrogen, it has\r\n       been termed Argon. Further reference will be made to it in the\r\n       Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn the air of the various countries of the earth, at different\r\nlongitudes and at different altitudes above its surface, on the ocean\r\nor on the dry land--in a word, in the air of most diverse localities\r\nof the earth--the oxygen and nitrogen are found everywhere to be in a\r\nconstant ratio. This is, moreover, self-evident from the fact that the\r\nair constantly diffuses (intermixes by virtue of the internal motion of\r\nthe gaseous particles) and is also put into motion and intermixed by\r\nthe wind, by which processes it is equalised in its composition over\r\nthe entire surface of the earth. In those localities where the air is\r\nsubject to change, and is in a more or less enclosed space, or, at any\r\nrate, in an unventilated space, it may alter very considerably in its\r\ncomposition. For this reason the air in dwellings, cellars, and wells,\r\nin which there are substances absorbing oxygen, contains less of this\r\ngas, whilst the air on the surface of standing water, which abounds in\r\nthe lower orders of plant life evolving oxygen, contains an excess of\r\nthis gas.[17] The constant composition of air over the whole surface of\r\nthe earth has been proved by a number of most careful researches.[18]\r\n\r\n  [17] As a further proof of the fact that certain circumstances may\r\n       change the composition of air, it will be enough to point out\r\n       that the air contained in the cavities of glaciers contains only\r\n       up to 10 p.c. of oxygen. This depends on the fact that at low\r\n       temperatures oxygen is much more soluble in snow-water and snow\r\n       than nitrogen. When shaken up with water the composition of air\r\n       should change, because the water dissolves unequal quantities of\r\n       oxygen and nitrogen. We have already seen (Chapter I.) that the\r\n       air boiled off from water saturated at about 0° contains about\r\n       thirty-five volumes of oxygen and sixty-five volumes of nitrogen,\r\n       and we have considered the reason of this.\r\n\r\n  [18] The analysis of air by weight conducted by Dumas and Boussingault\r\n       in Paris, which they repeated many times between April 27 and\r\n       September 22, 1841, under various conditions of weather, showed\r\n       that the amount by weight of oxygen only varies between 22·89\r\n       p.c. and 23·08 p.c., the average amount being 23·07 p.c. Brunner,\r\n       at Bern in Switzerland, and Bravais, at Faulhorn in the Bernese\r\n       Alps, at a height of two kilometres above the level of the sea,\r\n       Marignac at Geneva, Lewy at Copenhagen, and Stas at Brussels,\r\n       have analysed the air by the same methods, and found that its\r\n       composition does not exceed the limits determined for Paris.\r\n       The most recent determinations (with an accuracy of ±0·05 p.c.)\r\n       confirm the conclusion that the composition of the atmosphere is\r\n       constant.\r\n\r\n       As there are some grounds (which will be mentioned shortly) for\r\n       considering that the composition of the air at great altitudes\r\n       is slightly different from that at attainable heights--namely,\r\n       that it is richer in the lighter nitrogen--several fragmentary\r\n       observations made at Munich (Jolly, 1880) gave reason for\r\n       thinking that in the upward currents (that is in the region of\r\n       minimum barometric pressure or at the centres of meteorological\r\n       cyclones) the air is richer in oxygen than in the descending\r\n       currents of air (in the regions of anticyclones or of barometric\r\n       maxima); but more carefully conducted observations showed\r\n       this supposition to be incorrect. Improved methods for the\r\n       analysis of air have shown that certain slight variations in\r\n       its composition do actually occur, but in the first place they\r\n       depend on incidental local influences (on the passage of the air\r\n       over mountains and large surfaces of water, regions of forest\r\n       and herbage, and the like), and in the second place are limited\r\n       to quantities which are scarcely distinguishable from possible\r\n       errors in the analyses. The researches made by Kreisler in\r\n       Germany (1885) are particularly convincing.\r\n\r\n       The considerations which lead to the supposition that the\r\n       atmosphere at great altitudes contains less oxygen than at the\r\n       surface of the earth are based on the law of partial pressures\r\n       (Chapter I.) According to this law, the equilibrium of the\r\n       oxygen in the strata of the atmosphere is not dependent on\r\n       the equilibrium of the nitrogen, and the variation in the\r\n       densities of both gases with the height is determined by the\r\n       pressure of each gas separately. Details of the calculations\r\n       and considerations here involved are contained in my work _On\r\n       Barometric Levellings_, 1876, p. 48.\r\n\r\n       On the basis of the law of partial pressure and of hypsometrical\r\n       formulæ, expressing the laws of the variation of pressures at\r\n       different altitudes, the conclusion may be deduced that at the\r\n       upper strata of the atmosphere the proportion of the nitrogen\r\n       with respect to the oxygen increases, but the increase will not\r\n       exceed a fraction per cent., even at altitudes of four and a half\r\n       to six miles, the greatest height within the reach of men either\r\n       by climbing mountains or by means of balloons. This conclusion is\r\n       confirmed by the analyses of air collected by Welch in England\r\n       during his aëronautic ascents.\r\n\r\n_The analysis of air_ is effected by converting the oxygen into a\r\nnon-gaseous compound, so as to separate it from the air. The original\r\nvolume of the air is first measured, and then the volume of the\r\nremaining nitrogen. The quantity of oxygen is calculated either from\r\nthe difference between these volumes or by the weight of the oxygen\r\ncompound formed. All the volumetric measurements have to be corrected\r\nfor pressure, temperature, and moisture (Chapters I. and II.) The medium\r\nemployed for converting the oxygen into a non-gaseous substance should\r\nenable it to be taken up from the nitrogen to the very end without\r\nevolving any gaseous substance. So, for instance,[19] a mixture of\r\npyrogallol, C_{6}H_{6}O_{3}, with a solution of a caustic alkali absorbs\r\noxygen with great ease at the ordinary temperature (the solution turns\r\nblack), but it is unsuited for accurate analysis because it requires\r\nan aqueous solution of an alkali, and it alters the composition of\r\nthe air by acting on it as a solvent.[20] However, for approximate\r\ndeterminations this simple method gives results which are entirely\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n  [19] The complete absorption of the oxygen may be attained by\r\n       introducing moist phosphorus into a definite volume of air; the\r\n       occurrence of this is recognised by the fact of the phosphorus\r\n       becoming non-luminous in the dark. The amount of oxygen may be\r\n       determined by measuring the volume of nitrogen remaining. This\r\n       method however cannot give accurate results, owing to a portion\r\n       of the air being dissolved in the water, to the combination\r\n       of some of the nitrogen with oxygen and to the necessity of\r\n       introducing and withdrawing the phosphorus, which cannot be\r\n       accomplished without introducing bubbles of air.\r\n\r\n  [20] For rapid and approximate analyses (technical and hygienic), such\r\n       a mixture is very suitable for determining the amount of oxygen\r\n       in mixtures of gases from which the substances absorbed by\r\n       alkalis have first been removed. According to certain observers,\r\n       this mixture evolves a certain (small) quantity of carbonic oxide\r\n       after absorbing oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe determinations in a eudiometer (Chapter III.) give more exact\r\nresults, if all the necessary corrections for changes of pressure,\r\ntemperature, and moisture be taken into account. This determination\r\nis carried out essentially as follows:--A certain amount of air is\r\nintroduced into the eudiometer, and its volume is determined. About\r\nan equal volume of dry hydrogen is then passed into the eudiometer,\r\nand the volume again determined. The mixture is then exploded, in the\r\nway described for the determination of the composition of water. The\r\nremaining volume of the gaseous mixture is again measured; it will be\r\nless than the second of the previously measured volumes. Out of three\r\nvolumes which have disappeared, one belonged to the oxygen and two to\r\nthe hydrogen, consequently one-third of the loss of volume indicates the\r\namount of oxygen contained in the air.[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] Details of eudiometrical analysis must, as was pointed out in\r\n       Chap. III., Note 32, be looked for in works on analytical\r\n       chemistry. The same remark applies to the other analytical\r\n       methods mentioned in this work. They are only described for the\r\n       purpose of showing the diversity of the methods of chemical\r\n       research.\r\n\r\nThe most complete method for the analysis of air, and one which is\r\naccompanied by the least amount of error, consists in the direct\r\nweighing, as far as is possible, of the oxygen, nitrogen, water,\r\nand carbonic anhydride contained in it. For this purpose the air is\r\nfirst passed through an apparatus for retaining the moisture and\r\ncarbonic anhydride (which will be considered presently), and is then\r\nled through a tube which contains shavings of metallic copper and has\r\nbeen previously weighed. A long layer of such copper heated to redness\r\nabsorbs all the oxygen from the air, and leaves pure nitrogen, whose\r\nweight must be determined. This is done by collecting it in a weighed\r\nand exhausted globe, while the amount by weight of oxygen is shown by\r\nthe increase in weight of the tube with the copper after the experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Dumas and Boussingault's apparatus for the\r\nanalysis of air by weight. The globe B contains 10-15 litres. The air is\r\nfirst pumped out of it, and it is weighed empty. The tube T connected\r\nwith it is filled with copper, and is weighed empty of air. It is heated\r\nin a charcoal furnace. When the copper has become red-hot, the stopcock\r\n_r_ (near R) is slightly opened, and the air passes through the vessels\r\nL, containing a solution of potash, _f_, containing solutions and pieces\r\nof caustic potash, which remove the carbonic anhydride from the air,\r\nand then through _o_ and _t_, containing sulphuric acid (which has\r\nbeen previously boiled to expel dissolved air) and pumice-stone, which\r\nremoves the moisture from the air. The pure air then gives up its oxygen\r\nto the copper in T. When the air passes into T the stopcock R of the\r\nglobe B is opened, and it becomes filled with nitrogen. When the air\r\nceases to flow in, the stopcocks are closed, and the globe B and tube T\r\nweighed. The nitrogen is then pumped out of the tube and it is weighed\r\nagain. The increase in weight of the tube shows the amount of oxygen,\r\nand the difference of the second and third weighings of the tube, with\r\nthe increase in weight of the globe, gives the weight of the nitrogen.]\r\n\r\nAir free from moisture and carbonic anhydride[22] contains 20·95 to\r\n20·88[23] parts by volume of oxygen; the mean amount of oxygen will\r\ntherefore be 20·92 ± 0·05 per cent. Taking the density of air = 1 and of\r\noxygen = 1·105 and nitrogen 0·972 the composition of air by weight will\r\nbe 23·12 per cent. of oxygen and 76·88 per cent. of nitrogen.[24]\r\n\r\n  [22] Air free from carbonic anhydride indicates after explosion the\r\n       presence of a small quantity of carbonic anhydride, as De\r\n       Saussure remarked, and air free from moisture, after being\r\n       passed over red-hot copper oxide, appears invariably to contain\r\n       a small quantity of water, as Boussingault has observed. These\r\n       observations lead to the assumption that air always contains a\r\n       certain quantity of gaseous hydrocarbons, like marsh gas, which,\r\n       as we shall afterwards learn, is evolved from the earth, marshes,\r\n       &c. Its amount, however, does not exceed a few hundredths per\r\n       cent.\r\n\r\n  [23] The analyses of air are accompanied by errors, and there are\r\n       variations of composition attaining hundredths per cent.; the\r\n       average normal composition of air is therefore only correct to\r\n       the first decimal place.\r\n\r\n  [24] These figures express the mean composition of air from an average\r\n       of the most accurate determinations; they are accurate within\r\n       ±0·05 p.c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Apparatus for the absorption and washing\r\nof gases, known as Liebig's bulbs. The gas enters _m_, presses on\r\nthe absorptive liquid, and passes from m into _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_\r\nconsecutively, and escapes through _f_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Geisler's potash bulbs. The gas enters at\r\n_a_, and passes through a solution of potash in the lower bulbs, where\r\nthe carbonic anhydride is absorbed, and the gas escapes from _b_. The\r\nlower bulbs are arranged in a triangle, so that the apparatus can stand\r\nwithout support.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of the composition of air being altered by the mere\r\naction of a solvent very clearly shows that the component parts of air\r\nare in a state of mixture, in which any gases may occur; they do not\r\nin this case form a definite compound, although the composition of the\r\natmosphere does appear constant under ordinary conditions. The fact that\r\nits composition varies under different conditions confirms the truth\r\nof this conclusion, and therefore the constancy of the composition of\r\nair must not be considered as in any way dependent on the nature of the\r\ngases entering into its composition, but only as proceeding from cosmic\r\nphenomena co-operating towards this constancy. It must be admitted,\r\ntherefore, that the processes evolving oxygen, and chiefly the processes\r\nof the respiration of plants, are of equal force with those processes\r\nwhich absorb oxygen over the entire surface of the earth.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] In Chapter III., Note 4, an approximate calculation is made for\r\n       the determination of the balance of oxygen in the entire\r\n       atmosphere; it may therefore he supposed that the composition of\r\n       air will vary from time to time, the relation between vegetation\r\n       and the oxygen absorbing processes changes; but as the atmosphere\r\n       of the earth can hardly have a definite limit and we have\r\n       already seen (Chapter IV., Note 33) that there are observations\r\n       confirming this, it follows that our atmosphere should vary in\r\n       its component parts with the entire heavenly space, and therefore\r\n       it must he supposed that any variation in the composition by\r\n       weight of the air can only take place exceedingly slowly, and in\r\n       a manner imperceptible by experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Tube for the absorption of carbonic acid. A\r\nplug of cotton wool is placed in the bulb to prevent the powder of\r\nsoda-lime being carried off by the gas. The tube contains soda-lime and\r\nchloride of calcium.]\r\n\r\nAir always contains more or less moisture[26] and _carbonic anhydride_\r\nproduced by the respiration of animals and the combustion of carbon and\r\ncarboniferous compounds. The latter shows the properties of an acid\r\nanhydride. In order to determine the amount of carbonic anhydride in\r\nair, substances are employed which absorb it--namely, alkalis either in\r\nsolution or solid. A solution of caustic potash, KHO, is poured into\r\nlight glass vessels, through which the air is passed, and the amount\r\nof carbonic anhydride is determined by the increase in weight of the\r\nvessel. But it is best to take a solid porous alkaline mass such as\r\nsoda-lime.[27] With a slow current of air a layer of soda-lime 20 cm.\r\nin length is sufficient to completely deprive 1 cubic metre of air of\r\nthe carbonic anhydride it contains. A series of tubes containing calcium\r\nchloride for absorbing the moisture[28] is placed before the apparatus\r\nfor the absorption of the carbonic anhydride, and a measured mass of\r\nair is passed through the whole apparatus by means of an aspirator. In\r\nthis manner the determination of the moisture is combined with the\r\nabsorption of the carbonic anhydride. The arrangement shown in fig. 38\r\nis such a combination.\r\n\r\n  [26] The amount of moisture contained in the air is considered in\r\n       greater detail in the study of physics and meteorology and the\r\n       subject has been mentioned above, in Chapter I., Note 1, where\r\n       the methods of absorbing moisture from gases were pointed out.\r\n\r\n  [27] Soda-lime is prepared in the following manner:--Unslaked lime\r\n       is finely powdered and mixed with a slightly warmed and very\r\n       strong solution of caustic soda. The mixing should be done in\r\n       an iron dish, and the materials should be well stirred together\r\n       until the lime begins to slake. When the mass becomes hot, it\r\n       boils, swells up, and solidifies, forming a porous mass very rich\r\n       in alkali and capable of rapidly absorbing carbonic anhydride. A\r\n       lump of caustic soda or potash presents a much smaller surface\r\n       for absorption and therefore acts much less rapidly. It is\r\n       necessary to place an apparatus for absorbing water after the\r\n       apparatus for absorbing the carbonic anhydride, because the\r\n       alkali in absorbing the latter gives off water.\r\n\r\n  [28] It is evident that the calcium chloride employed for absorbing the\r\n       water should be free from lime or other alkalis in order that it\r\n       may not retain carbonic anhydride. Such calcium chloride may be\r\n       prepared in the following manner: A perfectly neutral solution of\r\n       calcium chloride is prepared from lime and hydrochloric acid; it\r\n       is then carefully evaporated first on a water-bath and then on a\r\n       sand-bath. When the solution attains a certain strength a scum is\r\n       formed, which solidifies at the surface. This scum is collected,\r\n       and will be found to be free from caustic alkalis. It is\r\n       necessary in any case to test it before use, as otherwise a large\r\n       error may be introduced into the results, owing to the presence\r\n       of free alkali (lime). It is best to pass carbonic anhydride\r\n       through the tube containing the calcium chloride for some time\r\n       before the experiment, in order to saturate any free alkali that\r\n       may remain from the decomposition of a portion of the calcium\r\n       chloride by water, CaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O = CaOH_{2}O + 2HCl.\r\n\r\nThe amount of carbonic anhydride[29] in free air is incomparably more\r\nconstant than the amount of moisture. The average amount in 100 volumes\r\nof dry air is approximately 0·03 volume--that is, 10,000 volumes of air\r\ncontain about three volumes of carbonic anhydride, most frequently about\r\n2·95 volumes. As the specific gravity of carbonic anhydride referred to\r\nair = 1·52, it follows that 100 parts by weight of air contain 0·045\r\npart by weight of carbonic anhydride. This quantity varies according\r\nto the time of year (more in winter), the altitude above the level of\r\nthe sea (less at high altitudes), the proximity to forests and fields\r\n(less) or cities (greater), &c. But the variation is small and rarely\r\nexceeds the limits of 2-1/2 to 4 ten-thousandths by volume.[30] As there\r\nare many natural local influences which either increase the amount of\r\ncarbonic anhydride in the air (respiration, combustion, decomposition,\r\nvolcanic eruptions, &c.), or diminish it (absorption by plants and\r\nwater), the reason of the great constancy in the amount of this gas in\r\nthe air must be looked for, in the first place, in the fact that the\r\nwind mixes the air of various localities together, and, in the second\r\nplace, in the fact that the waters of the ocean, holding carbonic acid\r\nin solution,[31] form an immense reservoir for regulating the amount of\r\nthis gas in the atmosphere. Immediately the partial pressure of the\r\ncarbonic anhydride in the air decreases, the water evolves it, and when\r\nthe partial pressure increases, it absorbs it, and thus nature supplies\r\nthe conditions for a natural state of moving equilibrium in this as in\r\nso many other instances.[32]\r\n\r\n  [29] Recourse is had to special methods when the determination only\r\n       takes note of the carbonic anhydride of the air. For instance,\r\n       it is absorbed by an alkali which does not contain carbonates\r\n       (by a solution of baryta or caustic soda mixed with baryta),\r\n       and then the carbonic anhydride is expelled by an excess of an\r\n       acid, and its amount determined by the volume given off. A rapid\r\n       method of determining CO_{2} (for hygienic purposes) is given by\r\n       the fall of tension produced by the introduction of an alkali\r\n       (the air having been either brought to dryness or saturated\r\n       with moisture). Dr. Schidloffsky's apparatus is based upon this\r\n       principle. The question as to the amount of carbonic anhydride\r\n       present in the air has been submitted to many voluminous and\r\n       exact researches, especially those of Reiset, Schloesing, Müntz,\r\n       and Aubin, who showed that the amount is not subject to such\r\n       variations as at first announced on the basis of incomplete and\r\n       insufficiently accurate determinations.\r\n\r\n  [30] It is a different case in enclosed spaces, in dwellings, cellars,\r\n       wells, caves, and mines, where the renewal of air is impeded.\r\n       Under these circumstances large quantities of carbonic anhydride\r\n       may accumulate. In cities, where there are many conditions for\r\n       the evolution of carbonic anhydride (respiration, decomposition,\r\n       combustion), its amount is greater than in free air, yet even\r\n       in still weather the difference does not often exceed one\r\n       ten-thousandth (that is, rarely attains 4 instead of 2·9 vols. in\r\n       10000 vols. of air).\r\n\r\n  [31] In the sea as well as in fresh water, carbonic acid occurs in\r\n       two forms, directly dissolved in the water, and combined with\r\n       lime as calcium bicarbonate (hard waters sometimes contain very\r\n       much carbonic acid in this form). The tension of the carbonic\r\n       anhydride in the first form varies with the temperature, and\r\n       its amount with the partial pressure, and that in the form of\r\n       acid salts is under the same conditions, for direct experiments\r\n       have shown a similar dependence in this case, although the\r\n       quantitative relations are different in the two cases.\r\n\r\n  [32] In studying the phenomena of nature the conclusion is arrived at\r\n       that the universally reigning state of mobile equilibrium forms\r\n       the chief reason for that harmonious order which impresses all\r\n       observers. It not unfrequently happens that we do not see the\r\n       causes regulating the order and harmony; in the particular\r\n       instance of carbonic anhydride, it is a striking circumstance\r\n       that in the first instance a search was made for an harmonious\r\n       and strict uniformity, and in incidental (insufficiently\r\n       accurate and fragmentary) observations conditions were even\r\n       found for concluding it to be absent. When, later, the rule of\r\n       this uniformity was confirmed, then the causes regulating such\r\n       order were also discovered. The researches of Schloesing were of\r\n       this character. Deville's idea of the dissociation of the acid\r\n       carbonates of sea-water is suggested in them. In many other cases\r\n       also, a correct interpretation can only follow from a detailed\r\n       investigation.\r\n\r\nBesides nitrogen, oxygen, moisture, and carbonic acid, all the other\r\nsubstances occurring in air are found in infinitesimally small\r\nquantities by weight, and therefore the _weight of a cubic measure of\r\nair_ depends, to a sensible degree, on the above-named components alone.\r\nWe have already mentioned that at 0° and 760 mm. pressure the weight\r\nof a cubic litre of air is 1·293 gram. This weight varies with the\r\nacceleration of gravity, _g_, so that if _g_ be expressed in metres the\r\nweight of a litre of air, _e_ = _g_ × 0·131844 gram. For St. Petersburg\r\n_g_ is about 9·8188, and therefore _e_ is about 1·2946,[33] the air\r\nbeing understood to be dry and free from carbonic anhydride. Taking\r\nthe amount of the latter as 0·03 per 100 volumes, we obtain a greater\r\nweight; for example, for St. Petersburg _e_ = 1·2948 instead of 1·2946\r\ngram. The weight of one litre of moist air in which the tension[34] of\r\nthe aqueous vapour (partial pressure) = _f_ mm., at a pressure (total)\r\nof air of H millimetres, at a temperature _t_, will be (_i.e._, if\r\nat 0° and 760 mm. the weight of dry air = _e_) equal to _e_/(1 +\r\n0·00367_t_) × (H - 0·38_f_)/760. For instance, if H = 730 mm., _t_ = 20°,\r\nand _f_ = 10 mm. (the moisture is then slightly below 60 p.c.), the\r\nweight of a litre of air at St. Petersburg = 1·1527 gram.[35]\r\n\r\n  [33] The difference of the weight of a litre of dry air (free from\r\n       carbonic anhydride) at 0° and 760 mm., at different longitudes\r\n       and altitudes, depends on the fact that the force of gravity\r\n       varies under these conditions, and with it the pressure of the\r\n       barometrical column also varies. This is treated in detail\r\n       in my works _On the Elasticity of Gases_ and _On Barometric\r\n       Levellings_, and 'The Publications of the Weights and Measures\r\n       Department' (_Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society_,\r\n       1894).\r\n\r\n       In reality the weight is not measured in absolute units of weight\r\n       (in pressure--refer to works on mechanics and physics), but in\r\n       relative units (grams, scale weights) whose mass is invariable,\r\n       and therefore the variation of the weight of the weights itself\r\n       with the change of gravity must not be here taken into account,\r\n       for we are here dealing with weights proportional to masses,\r\n       since with a change of locality the weight of the weights varies\r\n       as the weight of a given volume of air does. In other words: the\r\n       mass of a substance always remains constant, but the pressure\r\n       produced by it varies with the acceleration of gravity: the gram,\r\n       pound, and other units of weight are really units of mass.\r\n\r\n  [34] The tension of the aqueous vapour in the air is determined by\r\n       hygrometers and other similar methods. It may also be determined\r\n       by analysis (_see_ Chapter I., Note 1).\r\n\r\n  [35] For rapid calculation the weight of a litre of air (in a room) in\r\n       St. Petersburg, may under these conditions (H, _t_, and _f_)\r\n       be obtained by the formula _e_ = 1·20671 + 0·0016 [H_{1}-755 +\r\n       2·6(18°-_t_°)] where H_{1} = H-0·38_f_. In determining the weight\r\n       of small and heavy objects (crucibles, &c. in analysis, and in\r\n       determining the specific gravities of liquids, &c.) _a correction\r\n       may be introduced for the loss of weight_ in the air of the\r\n       room, by taking the weight of a litre of air displaced as 1·2\r\n       gram, and consequently 0·0012 gram for every cubic centimetre.\r\n       But if gases or, in general, large vessels are weighed, and the\r\n       weighings require to be accurate, it is necessary to take into\r\n       account all the data for the determination of the density of the\r\n       air (_t_, H, and _f_), because sensitive balances can determine\r\n       the possible variations of the weight of air, as in the case of a\r\n       litre the weight of air varies in centigrams, even at a constant\r\n       temperature, with variations of H and _f_. Some time ago (1859) I\r\n       proposed the following method and applied it for this purpose. A\r\n       large light and closed vessel is taken, and its volume and weight\r\n       in a vacuum are accurately determined, and verified from time\r\n       to time. On weighing it we obtain the weight in air of a given\r\n       density, and by subtracting this weight from its absolute weight\r\n       and dividing by its volume we obtain the density of the air.\r\n\r\nThe presence of ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, in the\r\nair, is indicated by the fact that all acids exposed to the air absorb\r\nammonia from it after a time. De Saussure observed that aluminium\r\nsulphate is converted by air into a double sulphate of ammonium and\r\naluminium, or the so-called ammonia alum. Quantitative determinations\r\nhave shown that the amount of ammonia[36] contained in air varies at\r\ndifferent periods. However, it may be accepted that 100 cubic metres of\r\nair do not contain less than 1 or more than 5 milligrams of ammonia.\r\nIt is remarkable that mountain air contains more ammonia than the air\r\nof valleys. The air in those places where animal substances undergoing\r\nchange are accumulated, and especially that of stables, generally\r\ncontains a much greater quantity of this gas. This is the reason of the\r\npeculiar pungent smell noticed in such places. Moreover ammonia, as we\r\nshall learn in the following chapter, combines with acids, and should\r\ntherefore be found in air in the form of such combinations, since air\r\ncontains carbonic and nitric acids.\r\n\r\n  [36] Schloesing studied the equilibrium of the ammonia of the\r\n       atmosphere and of the rivers, seas, &c., and showed that the\r\n       amount of the gas is interchangeable between them. The ratio\r\n       between the amount of ammonia in a cubic metre of air and a litre\r\n       of water at 0° = 0·004, at 10° = 0·010, at 25° = 0·040 to 1, and\r\n       therefore in nature there is a state of equilibrium in the amount\r\n       of ammonia in the atmosphere and waters.\r\n\r\nThe presence of nitric acid in air is proved without doubt by the fact\r\nthat rain-water contains an appreciable amount of it.\r\n\r\nFurther (as already mentioned in Chapter IV.), air contains ozone\r\nand hydrogen peroxide and nitrous acid (and its ammonia salt), _i.e._\r\nsubstances having a direct oxidising action (for instance, upon iodized\r\nstarch-paper), but they are present in very small quantities.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] Whilst formed in the air these oxidising substances (N_{2}O_{3},\r\n       ozone and hydrogen peroxide) at the same time rapidly disappear\r\n       from it by oxidising those substances which are capable of\r\n       being oxidised. Owing to this instability their amounts vary\r\n       considerably, and, as would be expected, they are met with to an\r\n       appreciable amount in pure air, whilst their amount decreases\r\n       to zero in the air of cities, and especially in dwellings where\r\n       there is a maximum of substances capable of oxidisation and a\r\n       minimum of conditions for the formation of such bodies. There\r\n       is a causal connection between the amount of these substances\r\n       present in the air and its purity--that is, the amount of foreign\r\n       residues of organic origin liable to oxidation present in the\r\n       air. Where there is much of such residues their amount must be\r\n       small. When they are present the amount of organic substances\r\n       must be small, as otherwise they would be destroyed. For this\r\n       reason efforts have been made to apply ozone for purifying the\r\n       air by evolving it by artificial means in the atmosphere; for\r\n       instance, by passing a series of electrical sparks through\r\n       the ventilating pipes conveying air into a building. Air thus\r\n       ozonised destroys by oxidation--that is, brings about the\r\n       combustion of--the organic residues present in the air, and\r\n       thus will serve for purifying it. For these reasons the air of\r\n       cities contains less ozone and such like oxidising agents than\r\n       country air. This forms the distinguishing feature of country\r\n       air. However, animal life cannot exist in air containing a\r\n       comparatively large amount of ozone.\r\n\r\nBesides substances in a gaseous or vaporous state,[38] there is always\r\nfound a more or less considerable quantity of substances which are\r\nnot known in a state of vapour. These substances are present in the\r\nair as _dust_. If a linen surface, moistened with an acid, be placed\r\nin perfectly pure air, then the washings are found to contain sodium,\r\ncalcium, iron, and potassium.[39] Linen moistened with an alkali absorbs\r\ncarbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric, and hydrochloric acids. Further, the\r\npresence of organic substances in air has been proved by a similar\r\nexperiment. If a glass globe be filled with ice and placed in a room\r\nwhere are a number of people, then the presence of organic substances,\r\nlike albuminous substances, may be proved in the water which condenses\r\non the surface of the globe. It may be that the miasmas causing\r\ninfection in marshy localities, hospitals, and in certain epidemic\r\nillnesses proceed from the presence of such substances in the air (and\r\nespecially in water, which contains many micro-organisms), as well as\r\nfrom the presence of germs of lower organisms in the air as a minute\r\ndust. Pasteur proved the existence of such germs in the air by the\r\nfollowing experiment:--He placed gun-cotton (pyroxylin), which has the\r\nappearance of ordinary cotton, in a glass tube. Gun-cotton is soluble\r\nin a mixture of ether and alcohol, forming the so-called collodion.\r\nA current of air was passed through the tube for a long period of\r\ntime, and the gun-cotton was then dissolved in a mixture of ether and\r\nalcohol. An insoluble residue was thus obtained which actually contained\r\nthe germs of organisms, as was shown by microscopical observations,\r\nand by their capacity to develop into organisms (mould, &c.) under\r\nfavourable conditions. The presence of these germs determines the\r\nproperty of air of bringing about the processes of putrefaction and\r\nfermentation--that is the fundamental alteration of organic substances,\r\nwhich is accompanied by an entire change in their properties. The\r\nappearance of lower organisms, both vegetable and animal, is always to\r\nbe remarked in these processes. Thus, for instance, in the process of\r\nfermentation, when, for example, wine is procured from the sweet juice\r\nof grapes, a sediment separates out which is known under the name of\r\nlees, and contains peculiar yeast organisms. Germs are required before\r\nthese organisms can appear.[40] They are floating in the air, and fall\r\ninto the sweet fermentable liquid from it. Finding themselves under\r\nfavourable conditions, the germs develop into organisms; they are\r\nnourished at the expense of the organic substance, and during growth\r\nchange and destroy it, and bring about fermentation and putrefaction.\r\nThis is why, for instance, the juice of the grape when contained in the\r\nskin of the fruit, which allows access of the air but is impenetrable to\r\nthe germs, does not ferment, does not alter so long as the skin remains\r\nintact. This is also the reason why animal substances when kept from the\r\naccess of air may be preserved for a great length of time. Preserved\r\nfoods for long sea voyages are kept in this way.[41] Hence it is\r\nevident that however infinitesimal the quantity of germs carried in the\r\natmosphere may be, still they have an immense significance in nature.[42]\r\n\r\n  [38] Amongst them we may mention iodine and alcohol, C_{2}H_{6}O, which\r\n       Müntz found to be always present in air, the soil, and water,\r\n       although in minute traces only.\r\n\r\n  [39] A portion of the atmospheric dust is of cosmic origin; this is\r\n       undoubtedly proved by the fact of its containing metallic iron as\r\n       do meteorites. Nordenskiöld found iron in the dust covering snow,\r\n       and Tissandier in every kind of air, although naturally in very\r\n       small quantities.\r\n\r\n  [40] The idea of the spontaneous growth of organisms in a suitable\r\n       medium, although still upheld by many, has since the work of\r\n       Pasteur and his followers (and to a certain extent of his\r\n       predecessors) been discarded, because it has been proved how,\r\n       when, and whence (from the air, water, &c.) the germs appear;\r\n       that fermentation as well as infectious diseases cannot take\r\n       place without them; and chiefly because it has been shown that\r\n       any change accompanied by the development of the organisms\r\n       introduced may be brought about at will by the introduction of\r\n       the germs into a suitable medium.\r\n\r\n  [41] In further confirmation of the fact that putrefaction and\r\n       fermentation depend on germs carried in the air, we may cite the\r\n       circumstance that poisonous substances destroying the life of\r\n       organisms stop or hinder the appearance of the above processes.\r\n       Air which has been heated to redness or passed through sulphuric\r\n       acid no longer contains the germs of organisms, and loses the\r\n       faculty of producing fermentation and putrefaction.\r\n\r\n  [42] Their presence in the air is naturally due to the diffusion of\r\n       germs into the atmosphere, and owing to their microscopical\r\n       dimensions, they, as it were, hang in the air in virtue of their\r\n       large surfaces compared to their weight. In Paris the amount of\r\n       dust suspended in the air equals from 6 (after rain) to 23 grams\r\n       per 1,000 c.m. of air.\r\n\r\nThus we see that air contains a great variety of substances. The\r\nnitrogen, which is found in it in the largest quantity, has the least\r\ninfluence on those processes which are accomplished by the action\r\nof air. The oxygen, which is met with in a lesser quantity than the\r\nnitrogen, on the contrary takes a very important part in a number of\r\nreactions; it supports combustion and respiration, it brings about\r\ndecomposition and every process of slow oxidation. The part played by\r\nthe moisture of air is well known. The carbonic anhydride, which is met\r\nwith in still smaller quantities, has an immense significance in nature,\r\ninasmuch as it serves for the nourishment of plants. The importance of\r\nthe ammonia and nitric acid is very great, because they are the sources\r\nof the nitrogenous substances comprising an indispensable element in all\r\nliving organisms. And, lastly, the infinitesimal quantity of germs also\r\nhave a great significance in a number of processes. Thus it is not the\r\nquantitative but the qualitative relations of the component parts of the\r\natmosphere which determine its importance in nature.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] We see similar cases everywhere. For example, the predominating\r\n       mass of sand and clay in the soil takes hardly any chemical part\r\n       in the economy of the soil in respect to the nourishment of\r\n       plants. The plants by their roots search for substances which\r\n       are diffused in comparatively small quantities in the soil. If a\r\n       large quantity of these nourishing substances are removed, then\r\n       the plants will not develop in the soil, just as animals die in\r\n       oxygen.\r\n\r\nAir, being a mixture of various substances, may suffer considerable\r\n_changes_ in consequence of incidental circumstances. It is particularly\r\nnecessary to remark those changes in the composition of air which take\r\nplace in dwellings and in various localities where human beings have\r\nto remain during a lengthy period of time. The respiration of human\r\nbeings and animals alters the air.[44] A similar deterioration of air\r\nis produced by the influence of decomposing organic substances, and\r\nespecially of substances burning in it.[45] Hence it is necessary\r\nto have regard to the purification of the air of dwellings. The\r\nrenewal of air, the replacing of respired by fresh air, is termed\r\n'ventilation,'[46] and the removal of foreign and injurious admixtures\r\nfrom the air is called 'disinfection.'[47] The accumulation of all kinds\r\nof impurities in the air of dwellings and cities is the reason why the\r\nair of mountains, forests, seas, and non-marshy localities, covered with\r\nvegetation or snow, is distinguished for its freshness, and, in all\r\nrespects, beneficial action.\r\n\r\n  [44] A man in breathing burns about 10 grams of carbon per hour--that\r\n       is, he produces about 880 grams, or (as 1 cub.m. of carbonic\r\n       anhydride weighs about 2,000 grams) about 5/12 c.m. of carbonic\r\n       anhydride. The air coming from the lungs contains 4 p.c. of\r\n       carbonic anhydride by volume. The exhaled air acts as a direct\r\n       poison, owing to this gas and to other impurities.\r\n\r\n  [45] For this reason candles, lamps, and gas change the composition\r\n       of air almost in the same way as respiration. In the burning of 1\r\n       kilogram of stearin candles, 50 cubic metres of air are changed\r\n       as by respiration--that is, 4 p.c. of carbonic anhydride will\r\n       be formed in this volume of air. The respiration of animals and\r\n       exhalations from their skins, and especially from the intestines\r\n       and the excrements and the transformations taking place in them,\r\n       contaminate the air to a still greater extent, because they\r\n       introduce other volatile substances besides carbonic anhydride\r\n       into the air. At the same time that carbonic anhydride is formed\r\n       the amount of oxygen in the air decreases, and there is noticed\r\n       the appearance of miasmata which occur in but small quantity,\r\n       but which are noticeable in passing from fresh air into a\r\n       confined space full of such adulterated air. The researches of\r\n       Schmidt and Leblanc and others show that even with 20·6 p.c. of\r\n       oxygen (instead of 20·9 p.c.), when the diminution is due to\r\n       respiration, air becomes noticeably less fit for respiration,\r\n       and that the heavy feeling experienced in such air increases\r\n       with a lesser percentage of oxygen. It is difficult to remain\r\n       for a few minutes in air containing 17·2 p.c. of oxygen. These\r\n       observations were chiefly obtained by observations on the air of\r\n       different mines, at different depths below the surface. The air\r\n       of theatres and buildings full of people also proves to contain\r\n       less oxygen; it was found on one occasion that at the end of a\r\n       theatrical representation the air in the stalls contained 20·75\r\n       p.c. of oxygen, whilst the air at the upper part of the theatre\r\n       contained only 20·36 p.c. The amount of carbonic anhydride in\r\n       the air may be taken as a measure of its purity (Pettenkofer).\r\n       When it reaches 1 p.c. it is very difficult for human beings to\r\n       remain long in such air, and it is necessary to set up a vigorous\r\n       ventilation for the removal of the adulterated air. In order\r\n       to keep the air in dwellings in a uniformly good state, it is\r\n       necessary to introduce at least 10 cubic metres of fresh air per\r\n       hour per person. We saw that a man exhales about five-twelfths\r\n       of a cubic metre of carbonic anhydride per day. Accurate\r\n       observations have shown that air containing one-tenth p.c. of\r\n       exhaled carbonic anhydride (and consequently also a corresponding\r\n       amount of the other substances evolved together with it) is not\r\n       felt to be oppressive; and therefore the five-twelfth cubic\r\n       metres of carbonic anhydride should be diluted with 420 cubic\r\n       metres of fresh air if it be desired to keep not more than\r\n       one-tenth p.c. (by volume) of carbonic anhydride in the air.\r\n       Hence a man requires 420 cubic metres of air per day, or 18 cubic\r\n       metres per hour. With the introduction of only 10 cubic metres of\r\n       fresh air per person, the amount of carbonic anhydride may reach\r\n       one-fifth p.c., and the air will not then be of the requisite\r\n       freshness.\r\n\r\n  [46] The _ventilation_ of inhabited buildings is most necessary, and\r\n       is even indispensable in hospitals, schools, and similar\r\n       buildings. In winter it is carried on by the so-called\r\n       calorifiers or stoves heating the air before it enters. The best\r\n       kind of calorifiers in this respect are those in which the fresh\r\n       cold air is led through a series of pipes heated by the hot gases\r\n       coming from a stove. In ventilation, particularly during winter,\r\n       care is taken that the incoming air shall be moist, because\r\n       in winter the amount of moisture in the air is very small.\r\n       Ventilation, besides introducing fresh air into a dwelling-place,\r\n       must also withdraw the air already spoilt by respiration and\r\n       other causes--that is, it is necessary to construct channels for\r\n       the escape of the bad air, besides those for the introduction of\r\n       fresh air. In ordinary dwelling-places, where not many people\r\n       are congregated, the ventilation is conducted by natural means,\r\n       in the heating by fires, through crevices, windows, and various\r\n       orifices in walls, doors, and windows. In mines, factories, and\r\n       workrooms ventilation is of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n       Animal vitality may still continue for a period of several\r\n       minutes in air containing up to 30 p.c. of carbonic anhydride, if\r\n       the remaining 70 p.c. consist of ordinary air; but respiration\r\n       ceases after a certain time, and death may even ensue. The\r\n       flame of a candle is very easily extinguished in an atmosphere\r\n       containing from 5 to 6 p.c. of carbonic anhydride, but animal\r\n       vitality can be sustained in it for a somewhat long time,\r\n       although the effect of such air is exceedingly painful even to\r\n       the lower animals. There are mines in which a lighted candle\r\n       easily goes out from the excess of carbonic anhydride, but in\r\n       which the miners have to remain for a long time. The presence\r\n       of 1 p.c. of carbonic oxide is deadly even to cold-blooded\r\n       animals. The air in the galleries of a mine where blasting\r\n       has taken place, is known to produce a state of insensibility\r\n       resembling that produced by charcoal fumes. Deep wells and\r\n       vaults not unfrequently contain similar substances, and their\r\n       atmosphere often causes suffocation. The atmospheres of such\r\n       places cannot be tested by lowering a lighted candle into it, as\r\n       these poisonous gases would not extinguish the flame. This method\r\n       only suffices to indicate the amount of carbonic anhydride. If a\r\n       candle keeps alight, it signifies that there is less than 6 p.c.\r\n       of this gas. In doubtful cases it is best to lower a dog or other\r\n       animal into the air to be tested. If CO_{2} be very carefully\r\n       added to air, the flame of a candle is not extinguished (although\r\n       it becomes very much smaller) even when the gas amounts to 12\r\n       p.c. of air. Researches made by F. Clowes (1894) show that the\r\n       flames (in every case 3/4 in. long) of different combustible\r\n       substances are extinguished by the gradual addition of different\r\n       percentages of nitrogen and carbonic acid to the air; the\r\n       percentage sufficient to extinguish the flame being as follows\r\n       (the percentage of oxygen is given in parenthesis):\r\n\r\n                                  p.c. CO_{2}   p.c.  N.\r\n               Absolute alcohol    14  (18·1)    21 (16·6)\r\n               Candle              14  (18·1)    22 (16·4)\r\n               Hydrogen            58  ( 8·8)    70 ( 6·3)\r\n               Coal gas            33  (14·1)    46 (11·3)\r\n               Carbonic oxide      24  (16·0)    28 (15·1)\r\n               Methane             10  (18·9)    17 (17·4)\r\n\r\n       The flames of all solid and liquid substances is extinguished by\r\n       almost the same percentage of CO_{2} or N_{2}, but the flames of\r\n       different gases vary in this respect, and hydrogen continues to\r\n       burn in mixtures which are far poorer in oxygen than those in\r\n       which the flames of other combustible gases are extinguished;\r\n       the flame of methane CH_{4} is the most easily extinguished. The\r\n       percentage of nitrogen may be greater than that of CO_{2}. This,\r\n       together with the fact that, under the above circumstances, the\r\n       flame of a gas before going out becomes fainter and increases in\r\n       size, seems to indicate that the chief reason for the extinction\r\n       of the flame is the fall in its temperature.\r\n\r\n  [47] Different so-called disinfectants purify the air, and prevent the\r\n       injurious action of certain of its components by changing or\r\n       destroying them. Disinfection is especially necessary in those\r\n       places where a considerable amount of volatile substances\r\n       are evolved into the air, and where organic substances are\r\n       decomposed; for instance, in hospitals, closets, &c. The numerous\r\n       disinfectants are of the most varied nature. They may be divided\r\n       into oxidising, antiseptic, and absorbent substances. To the\r\n       oxidising substances used for disinfection belong chlorine, and\r\n       various substances evolving it, because chlorine in the presence\r\n       of water oxidises the majority of organic substances, and this\r\n       is why chlorine is used as a disinfectant for Siberian plagues.\r\n       Further, to this class belong the permanganates of the alkalis\r\n       and peroxide of hydrogen, as substances easily oxidising matters\r\n       dissolved in water; these salts are not volatile like chlorine,\r\n       and therefore act much more slowly, and in a much more limited\r\n       sphere. Antiseptic substances are those which convert organic\r\n       substances into such as are little prone to change, and prevent\r\n       putrefaction and fermentation. They most probably kill the\r\n       germs of organisms occurring in miasmata. The most important of\r\n       these substances are creosote and phenol (carbolic acid), which\r\n       occur in tar, and act in preserving smoked meat. Phenol is a\r\n       substance little soluble in water, volatile, oily, and having the\r\n       characteristic smell of smoked objects. Its action on animals in\r\n       considerable quantities is injurious, but in small quantities,\r\n       used in the form of a weak solution, it prevents the change of\r\n       animal matter. The smell of privies, which depends on the change\r\n       of excremental matter, may be easily removed by means of chlorine\r\n       or phenol. Salicylic acid, thymol, common tar, and especially\r\n       its solution in alkalis as proposed by Nensky, &c., are also\r\n       substances having the same property. Absorbent substances are\r\n       of no less importance, especially as preventatives, than the\r\n       preceding two classes of disinfectants, inasmuch as they are\r\n       innocuous. They are those substances which absorb the odoriferous\r\n       gases and vapours emitted during putrefaction, which are chiefly\r\n       ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen, and other volatile compounds. To\r\n       this class belong charcoal, certain salts of iron, gypsum, salts\r\n       of magnesia, and similar substances, as well as peat, mould, and\r\n       clay. Questions of disinfection and ventilation appertain to the\r\n       most serious problems of common life and hygiene. These questions\r\n       are so vast that we are here able only to give a short outline of\r\n       their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n           THE COMPOUNDS OF NITROGEN WITH HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--The dry distillation of bones on a large scale.\r\nThe bones are heated in the vertical cylinders C (about 1-1/2 metre\r\nhigh and 30 centimetres in diameter). The products of distillation pass\r\nthrough the tubes T, into the condenser B, and receiver F. When the\r\ndistillation is completed the trap H is opened, and the burnt bones are\r\nloaded into trucks V. The roof M is then opened, and the cylinders are\r\ncharged with a fresh quantity of bones. The ammonia water is preserved,\r\nand goes to the preparation of ammoniacal salts, as described in the\r\nfollowing drawing.]\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw that nitrogen does not directly combine\r\nwith hydrogen, but that a mixture of these gases in the presence of\r\nhydrochloric acid gas, HCl, forms ammonium chloride, NH_{4}Cl, on the\r\npassage of a series of electric sparks.[1] In ammonium chloride, HCl\r\nis combined with NH_{3}, consequently N with H_{3} forms ammonia.[2]\r\nAlmost all the _nitrogenous substances of plants and animals_ evolve\r\nammonia when heated with an alkali. But even without the presence of\r\nan alkali the majority of nitrogenous substances, when decomposed or\r\nheated with a limited supply of air, evolve their nitrogen, if not\r\nentirely, at all events partially, in the form of ammonia. When animal\r\nsubstances such as skins, bones, flesh, hair, horns, &c., are heated\r\nwithout access of air in iron retorts--they undergo what is termed\r\ndry distillation. A portion of the resultant substances remains in the\r\nretort and forms a carbonaceous residue, whilst the other portion, in\r\nvirtue of its volatility, escapes through the tube leading from the\r\nretort. The vapours given off, on cooling, form a liquid which separates\r\ninto two layers; the one, which is oily, is composed of the so-called\r\nanimal oils (_oleum animale_): the other, an aqueous layer, contains\r\na solution of ammonia salts. If this solution be mixed with lime and\r\nheated, the lime takes up the elements of carbonic acid from the ammonia\r\nsalts, and ammonia is evolved as a gas.[3] In ancient times ammonia\r\ncompounds were imported into Europe from Egypt, where they were prepared\r\nfrom the soot obtained in the employment of camels' dung as fuel in\r\nthe locality of the temple of Jupiter Ammon (in Lybia), and therefore\r\nthe salt obtained was called 'sal-ammoniacale,' from which the name of\r\nammonia is derived. At the present time ammonia is obtained exclusively,\r\non a large scale, either from the products of the dry distillation of\r\nanimal or vegetable refuse, from urine, or from the ammoniacal liquors\r\ncollected in the destructive distillation of coal for the preparation\r\nof coal gas. This ammoniacal liquor is placed in a retort with lime and\r\nheated; the ammonia is then evolved together with steam.[4] In the arts,\r\nonly a small amount of ammonia is used in a free state--that is, in an\r\naqueous solution; the greater portion of it is converted into different\r\nsalts having technical uses, especially sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, and\r\nammonium sulphate, (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}. They are saline substances\r\nwhich are formed because ammonia, NH_{3}, combines with all acids, HX,\r\nforming ammonia salts, NH_{4}X. Sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, is a compound of\r\nammonia with hydrochloric acid. It is prepared by passing the vapours of\r\nammonia and water, evolved, as above described, from ammoniacal liquor,\r\ninto an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and on evaporating the\r\nsolution sal-ammoniac is obtained in the form of soluble crystals[5]\r\nresembling common salt in appearance and properties. Ammonia may be\r\nvery easily prepared _from_ this _sal-ammoniac_, NH_{4}Cl, as from any\r\nother ammoniacal salt, by heating it with lime. Calcium hydroxide,\r\nCaH_{2}O_{2}, as an alkali takes up the acid and sets free the\r\nammonia, forming calcium chloride, according to the equation 2NH_{4}Cl\r\n+ CaH_{2}O_{2} = 2H_{2}O + CaCl_{2} + 2NH_{3}. In this reaction the\r\nammonia is evolved as a gas.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Method of abstracting ammonia, on a large\r\nscale, from ammonia water obtained at gas works by the dry distillation\r\nof coal, or by the fermentation of urine, &c. This water is mixed with\r\nlime and poured into the boiler C´´, and from thence into C´ and C\r\nconsecutively. The last boiler is heated directly over a furnace, and\r\nhence no ammonia remains in solution after the liquid has been boiled\r\nin it. The liquid is therefore then thrown away. The ammonia vapour and\r\nsteam pass from the boiler C, through the tube T, into the boiler C´,\r\nand then into C´´, so that the solution in C´ becomes stronger than that\r\nin C, and still stronger in C´´. The boilers are furnished with stirrers\r\nA, A´, and A´´ to prevent the lime settling. From C´´ the ammonia and\r\nsteam pass through the tube T´´ into worm condensers surrounded with\r\ncold water, thence into the Woulfe's bottle P, where the solution of\r\nammonia is collected, and finally the still uncondensed ammonia vapour\r\nis led into the flat vessel R, containing acid which absorbs the last\r\ntraces of ammonia.]\r\n\r\n  [1] The ammonia in the air, water, and soil proceeds from the\r\n      decomposition of the nitrogenous substances of plants and animals,\r\n      and also probably from the reduction of nitrates. Ammonia is\r\n      always formed in the rusting of iron. Its formation in this case\r\n      depends in all probability on the decomposition of water, and on\r\n      the action of the hydrogen at the moment of its evolution on the\r\n      nitric acid contained in the air (Cloez), or on the formation of\r\n      ammonium nitrite, which takes place under many circumstances. The\r\n      evolution of vapours of ammonia compounds is sometimes observed\r\n      in the vicinity of volcanoes. At a red heat nitrogen combines\r\n      directly with B Ca Mg, and with many other metals, and these\r\n      compounds, when heated with a caustic alkali, or in the presence\r\n      of water, give ammonia (_see_ Chapter XIV., Note 14, and Chapter\r\n      XVII., Note 12). These are examples of the indirect combination of\r\n      nitrogen with hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [2] If a silent discharge or a series of electric sparks be passed\r\n      through ammonia gas, it is decomposed into nitrogen and\r\n      hydrogen. This is a phenomenon of dissociation; therefore, a\r\n      series of sparks do not totally decompose the ammonia, but\r\n      leave a certain portion undecomposed. One volume of nitrogen\r\n      and three volumes of hydrogen are obtained from two volumes of\r\n      ammonia decomposed. Ramsay and Young (1884) investigated the\r\n      decomposition of NH_{3} under the action of heat, and showed\r\n      that at 500°, 1-1/2 p.c. is decomposed, at 600° about 18 p.c.,\r\n      at 800° 65 p.c., but these results were hardly free from the\r\n      influence of 'contact.' The _presence_ of free ammonia--that is,\r\n      ammonia not combined with acids--in a gas or aqueous solution\r\n      may be recognised by its characteristic smell. But many ammonia\r\n      salts do not possess this smell. However, on the addition of\r\n      an alkali (for instance, caustic lime, potash, or soda), they\r\n      evolve ammonia gas, especially when heated. The presence of\r\n      ammonia may be made visible by introducing a substance moistened\r\n      with strong hydrochloric acid into its neighbourhood. A white\r\n      cloud, or visible white vapour, then makes its appearance. This\r\n      depends on the fact that both ammonia and hydrochloric acid are\r\n      volatile, and on coming into contact with each other produce\r\n      solid sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, which forms a cloud. This test is\r\n      usually made by dipping a glass rod into hydrochloric acid, and\r\n      holding it over the vessel from which the ammonia is evolved. With\r\n      small amounts of ammonia this test is, however, untrustworthy,\r\n      as the white vapour is scarcely observable. In this case it is\r\n      best to take paper moistened with mercurous nitrate, HgNO_{3}.\r\n      This paper turns black in the presence of ammonia, owing to the\r\n      formation of a black compound of ammonia with mercurous oxide. The\r\n      smallest traces of ammonia (for instance, in river water) may be\r\n      detected by means of the so-called Nessler's reagent, containing\r\n      a solution of mercuric chloride and potassium iodide, which forms\r\n      a brown coloration or precipitate with the smallest quantities\r\n      of ammonia. It will be useful here to give the thermochemical\r\n      data (in thousands of units of heat, according to Thomsen), or\r\n      the quantities of heat _evolved_ in the formation of ammonia and\r\n      its compounds in quantities expressed by their formulæ. Thus, for\r\n      instance, (N + H_{3}) 26·7 indicates that 14 grams of nitrogen\r\n      in combining with 3 grams of hydrogen develop sufficient heat to\r\n      raise the temperature of 26·7 kilograms of water 1°. (NH_{3} +\r\n      nH_{2}O) 8·4 (heat of solution); (NH_{3},nH_{2}O + HCl,nH_{2}O)\r\n      12·3; (N + H_{4} + Cl) 90·6; (NH_{3} + HCl) 41·9.\r\n\r\n  [3] The same ammonia water is obtained, although in smaller quantities,\r\n      in the dry distillation of plants and of coal, which consists\r\n      of the remains of fossil plants. In all these cases the ammonia\r\n      proceeds from the destruction of the complex nitrogenous\r\n      substances occurring in plants and animals. The ammonia salts\r\n      employed in the arts are prepared by this method.\r\n\r\n  [4] The technical methods for the preparation of ammonia water, and for\r\n      the extraction of ammonia from it, are to a certain extent\r\n      explained in the figures accompanying the text.\r\n\r\n  [5] Usually these crystals are sublimed by heating them in crucibles or\r\n      pots, when the vapours of sal-ammoniac condense on the cold covers\r\n      as a crust, in which form the salt comes into the market.\r\n\r\n  [6] On a small scale ammonia may be prepared in a glass flask by mixing\r\n      equal parts by weight of slaked lime and finely-powdered\r\n      sal-ammoniac, the neck of the flask being connected with an\r\n      arrangement for drying the gas obtained. In this instance\r\n      neither calcium chloride nor sulphuric acid can be used for\r\n      drying the gas, since both these substances absorb ammonia, and\r\n      therefore solid caustic potash, which is capable of retaining\r\n      the water, is employed. The gas-conducting tube leading from the\r\n      desiccating apparatus is introduced into a mercury bath, if dry\r\n      gaseous ammonia be required, because water cannot be employed\r\n      in collecting ammonia gas. Ammonia was first obtained in this\r\n      dry state by Priestley, and its composition was investigated by\r\n      Berthollet at the end of the last century. Oxide of lead mixed\r\n      with sal-ammoniac (Isambert) evolves ammonia with still greater\r\n      ease than lime. The cause and process of the decomposition are\r\n      almost the same, 2PbO + 2NH_{4}Cl = Pb_{2}OCl_{2} + H_{2}O +\r\n      2NH_{3}. Lead oxychloride is (probably) formed.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that all the complex nitrogenous substances of\r\nplants, animals, and soils are decomposed when heated with an excess\r\nof sulphuric acid, the whole of their nitrogen being converted into\r\nammonium sulphate, from which it may be liberated by treatment with\r\nan excess of alkali. This reaction is so complete that it forms the\r\nbasis of Kjeldahl's method for estimating the amount of nitrogen in its\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a colourless gas, resembling those with which we are already\r\nacquainted in its outward appearance, but clearly distinguishable from\r\nany other gas by its very characteristic and pungent smell. It irritates\r\nthe eyes, and it is positively impossible to inhale it. Animals die in\r\nit. Its density, referred to hydrogen, is 8·5; hence it is lighter than\r\nair. It belongs to the class of gases which are easily liquefied.[7]\r\nFaraday employed the following method for liquefying ammonia. Ammonia\r\nwhen passed over dry silver chloride, AgCl, is absorbed by it to a\r\nconsiderable extent, especially at low temperatures.[8] The solid\r\ncompound AgCl,3NH_{3} thus obtained is introduced into a bent tube\r\n(fig. 45), whose open end c is then fused up. The compound is then\r\nslightly heated at _a_, and the ammonia comes off, owing to the easy\r\ndissociation of the compound. The other end of the tube is immersed in\r\na freezing mixture. The pressure of the gas coming off, combined with\r\nthe low temperature at one end of the tube, causes the ammonia evolved\r\nto condense into a liquid, in which form it collects at the cold end of\r\nthe tube. If the heating be stopped, the silver chloride again absorbs\r\nthe ammonia. In this manner one tube may serve for repeated experiments.\r\nAmmonia may also be liquefied by the ordinary methods--that is, by means\r\nof pumping dry ammonia gas into a refrigerated space. Liquefied ammonia\r\nis a colourless and very mobile liquid,[9] whose specific gravity at 0°\r\nis 0·63 (E. Andréeff). At the temperature (about -70°) given by a mixture\r\nof liquid carbonic anhydride and ether, liquid ammonia crystallises, and\r\nin this form its odour is feeble, because at so low a temperature its\r\nvapour tension is very inconsiderable. The boiling point (at a pressure\r\nof 760 mm.) of liquid ammonia is about -32°. Hence this temperature may\r\nbe obtained at the ordinary pressure by the evaporation of liquefied\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--The liquefaction of ammonia in a thick bent\r\nglass tube. A compound of chloride of silver and ammonia is placed in\r\nthe end _a_, and the end _c_ is then sealed up.]\r\n\r\n  [7] [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Carré's apparatus. Described in text.]\r\n\r\n      This is evident from the fact that its absolute boiling point lies\r\n      at about +130° (Chapter II., Note 29). It may therefore be\r\n      liquefied by pressure alone at the ordinary, and even at much\r\n      higher temperatures. The latent heat of evaporation of 17 parts\r\n      by weight of ammonia equals 4,400 units of heat, and hence\r\n      liquid ammonia may be employed for the production of cold.\r\n      Strong aqueous solutions of ammonia, which in parting with their\r\n      ammonia act in a similar manner, are not unfrequently employed\r\n      for this purpose. Suppose a saturated solution of ammonia to be\r\n      contained in a closed vessel furnished with a receiver. If the\r\n      ammoniacal solution be heated, the ammonia, with a small quantity\r\n      of water, will pass off from the solution, and in accumulating\r\n      in the apparatus will produce a considerable pressure, and will\r\n      therefore liquefy in the cooler portions of the receiver. Hence\r\n      liquid ammonia will be obtained in the receiver. The heating of\r\n      the vessel containing the aqueous solution of ammonia is then\r\n      stopped. After having been heated it contains only water, or a\r\n      solution poor in ammonia. When once it begins to cool the ammonia\r\n      vapours commence dissolving in it, the space becomes rarefied, and\r\n      a rapid vaporisation of the liquefied ammonia left in the receiver\r\n      takes place. In evaporating in the receiver it will cause the\r\n      temperature in it to fall considerably, and will itself pass into\r\n      the aqueous solution. In the end, the same ammoniacal solution as\r\n      originally taken is re-obtained. Thus, in this case, on heating\r\n      the vessel the pressure increases by itself, and on cooling it\r\n      diminishes, so that here heat directly replaces mechanical work.\r\n      This is the principle of the simplest forms of _Carré's ice-making\r\n      machines_, shown in fig. 44. C is a vessel made of boiler plates\r\n      into which the saturated solution of ammonia is poured; m is a\r\n      tube conducting the ammonia vapour to the receiver A. All parts\r\n      of the apparatus should be hermetically joined together, and\r\n      should be able to withstand a pressure reaching ten atmospheres.\r\n      The apparatus should be freed from air, which would otherwise\r\n      hinder the liquefaction of the ammonia. The process is carried on\r\n      as follows:--The apparatus is first so inclined that any liquid\r\n      remaining in A may flow into C. The vessel C is then placed\r\n      upon a stove F, and heated until the thermometer _t_ indicates\r\n      a temperature of 130° C. During this time the ammonia has been\r\n      expelled from C, and has liquefied in A. In order to facilitate\r\n      the liquefaction, the receiver A should be immersed in a tank of\r\n      water R (_see_ the left-hand drawing in fig. 44). After about\r\n      half an hour, when it may be supposed that the ammonia has been\r\n      expelled, the fire is removed from under C, and this is now\r\n      immersed in the tank of water R. The apparatus is represented in\r\n      this position in the right-hand drawing of fig. 44. The liquefied\r\n      ammonia then evaporates, and passes over into the water in C. This\r\n      causes the temperature of A to fall considerably. The substance\r\n      to be refrigerated is placed in a vessel G, in the cylindrical\r\n      space inside the receiver A. The refrigeration is also kept on for\r\n      about half an hour, and with an apparatus of ordinary dimensions\r\n      (containing about two litres of ammonia solution), five kilograms\r\n      of ice are produced by the consumption of one kilogram of coal. In\r\n      industrial works more complicated types of Carré's machines are\r\n      employed.\r\n\r\n  [8] Below 15° (according to Isambert), the compound AgCl,3NH_{3} is\r\n      formed, and above 20° the compound 2AgCl,3NH_{3}. The tension of\r\n      the ammonia evolved from the latter substance is equal to the\r\n      atmospheric pressure at 68°, whilst for AgCl,3NH_{3} the pressures\r\n      are equal at about 20°; consequently, at higher temperatures\r\n      it is greater than the atmospheric pressure, whilst at lower\r\n      temperatures the ammonia is absorbed and forms this compound.\r\n      Consequently, all the phenomena of dissociation are here clearly\r\n      to be observed. Joannis and Croisier (1894) investigated similar\r\n      compounds with AgBr, AgI, AgCN and AgNO_{3}, and found that\r\n      they all give definite compounds with NH_{3}, for instance\r\n      AgBr,3NH_{3}, 2AgBr,3NH_{3} and AgBr,2NH_{3}; they are all\r\n      colourless, solid substances which decompose under the atmospheric\r\n      pressure at +3·5, +34° and +51°.\r\n\r\n  [9] The liquefaction of ammonia may be accomplished without an increase\r\n      of pressure, by means of refrigeration alone, in a carefully\r\n      prepared mixture of ice and calcium chloride (because the absolute\r\n      boiling point of NH_{3} is high, about +130°). It may even take\r\n      place in the severe frosts of a Russian winter. The application of\r\n      liquid ammonia as a motive power for engines forms a problem which\r\n      has to a certain extent been solved by the French engineer Tellier.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, containing, as it does, much hydrogen, is _capable of\r\ncombustion_; it does not, however, burn steadily, and sometimes not\r\nat all, in ordinary atmospheric air. In pure oxygen it burns with a\r\ngreenish-yellow flame,[10] forming water, whilst the nitrogen set\r\nfree gives its oxygen compounds--that is, oxides of nitrogen. The\r\ndecomposition of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen not only takes\r\nplace at a red heat and under the action of electric sparks, but also\r\nby means of many oxidising substances; for instance, by passing ammonia\r\nthrough a tube containing red-hot copper oxide. The water thus formed\r\nmay be collected by substances absorbing it, and the quantity of\r\nnitrogen may be measured in a gaseous form, and thus the composition\r\nof ammonia determined. In this manner it is very easy to prove that\r\nammonia contains 3 parts by weight of hydrogen to 14 parts by weight of\r\nnitrogen; and, by volume, 3 vols. of hydrogen and 1 vol. of nitrogen\r\nform 2 vols. of ammonia.[11]\r\n\r\n  [10] The combustion of ammonia in oxygen may be effected by the aid of\r\n       platinum. A small quantity of an aqueous solution of ammonia,\r\n       containing about 20 p.c. of the gas, is poured into a wide-necked\r\n       beaker of about one litre capacity. A gas-conducting tube about\r\n       10 mm. in diameter, and supplying oxygen, is immersed in the\r\n       aqueous solution of ammonia. But before introducing the gas an\r\n       incandescent platinum spiral is placed in the beaker; the ammonia\r\n       in the presence of the platinum is oxidised and burns, whilst the\r\n       platinum wire becomes still more incandescent. The solution of\r\n       ammonia is heated, and oxygen passed through the solution. The\r\n       oxygen, as it bubbles off from the ammonia solution, carries with\r\n       it a part of the ammonia, and this mixture explodes on coming\r\n       into contact with the incandescent platinum. This is followed\r\n       by a certain cooling effect, owing to the combustion ceasing,\r\n       but after a short interval this is renewed, so that one feeble\r\n       explosion follows after another. During the period of oxidation\r\n       without explosion, white vapours of ammonium nitrite and\r\n       red-brown vapours of oxides of nitrogen make their appearance,\r\n       while during the explosion there is complete combustion and\r\n       consequently water and nitrogen are formed.\r\n\r\n  [11] This may be verified by their densities. Nitrogen is 14 times\r\n       denser than hydrogen, and ammonia is 8-1/2 times. If 3 volumes\r\n       of hydrogen with 1 volume of nitrogen gave 4 volumes of ammonia,\r\n       then these 4 volumes would weigh 17 times as much as 1 volume of\r\n       hydrogen; consequently 1 volume of ammonia would be 4-1/4 times\r\n       heavier than the same volume of hydrogen. But if these 4 volumes\r\n       only give 2 volumes of ammonia, the latter will be 8-1/2 times as\r\n       dense as hydrogen, which is found to be actually the case.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is capable of combining with a number of substances, forming,\r\nlike water, substances of various degrees of stability. It is more\r\nsoluble than any of the gases yet described, both in water and in many\r\naqueous solutions. We have already seen, in the first chapter, that\r\none volume of water, at the ordinary temperature, dissolves about 700\r\nvols. of ammonia gas. The great solubility of ammonia enables it to\r\nbe always kept ready for use in the form of an aqueous solution,[12]\r\nwhich is commercially known as _spirits of hartshorn_. Ammonia water is\r\ncontinually evolving ammoniacal vapour, and so has the characteristic\r\nsmell of ammonia itself. It is a very characteristic and important\r\nfact that ammonia has an alkaline reaction, and colours litmus paper\r\nblue, just like caustic potash or lime; it is therefore sometimes\r\ncalled _caustic ammonia_ (volatile alkali). Acids may be saturated by\r\nammonia water or gas in exactly the same way as by any other alkali.\r\nIn this process _ammonia combines directly with acids_, and this forms\r\nthe most essential chemical reaction of this substance. If sulphuric,\r\nnitric, acetic, or any other acid be brought into contact with ammonia\r\nit absorbs it, and in so doing evolves a large amount of heat and forms\r\na compound having all the properties of a salt. Thus, for example,\r\nsulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, in absorbing ammonia, forms (on evaporating\r\nthe solution) two salts, according to the relative quantities of ammonia\r\nand acid. One salt is formed from NH_{3} + H_{2}SO_{4}, and consequently\r\nhas the composition NH_{5}SO_{4}, and the other is formed from 2NH_{3}\r\n+ H_{2}SO_{4}, and its composition is therefore N_{2}H_{8}SO_{4}. The\r\nformer has an acid reaction and the latter a neutral reaction, and\r\nthey are called respectively acid ammonium sulphate (ammonium hydrogen\r\nsulphate), and normal ammonium sulphate, or simply ammonium sulphate.\r\nThe same takes place in the action of all other acids; but certain of\r\nthem are able to form normal ammonium salts only, whilst others give\r\nboth acid and normal ammonium salts. This depends on the nature of\r\nthe acid and not on the ammonia, as we shall afterwards see. Ammonium\r\nsalts are very similar in appearance and in many of their properties\r\nto metallic salts; for instance, sodium chloride, or table salt,\r\nresembles sal-ammoniac, or ammonium chloride, not only in its outward\r\nappearance but even in crystalline form, in its property of giving\r\nprecipitates with silver salts, in its solubility in water, and in\r\nits evolving hydrochloric acid when heated with sulphuric acid--in a\r\nword, a most perfect analogy is to be remarked in an entire series of\r\nreactions. An analogy in composition is seen if sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl,\r\nbe compared with table salt, NaCl; and the ammonium hydrogen sulphate,\r\nNH_{4}HSO_{4}, with the sodium hydrogen sulphate, NaHSO_{4}; or ammonium\r\nnitrate, NH_{4}NO_{3}, with sodium nitrate, NaNO_{3}.[13] It is seen,\r\non comparing the above compounds, that the part which sodium takes in\r\nthe sodium salts is played in ammonium salts by a group NH_{4}, which\r\nis called _ammonium_. If table salt be called 'sodium chloride,' then\r\nsal-ammoniac should be and is called 'ammonium chloride.'\r\n\r\n  [12] Aqueous solutions of ammonia are lighter than water, and at 15°,\r\n       taking water at 4° = 10,000, their specific gravity, as dependent\r\n       on _p_, or the percentage amount (by weight) of ammonia, is given\r\n       by the expression _s_ = 9,992-42·5_p_ + 0·21_p_^2; for instance,\r\n       with 10 p.c. _s_ = 9,587. If _t_ represents the temperature\r\n       between the limits of +10° and +20°, then the expression\r\n       (15-_t_)(1·5 + 0·14_p_) must be added to the formula for the\r\n       specific gravity. Solutions containing more than 24 p.c. have\r\n       not been sufficiently investigated in respect to the variation\r\n       of their specific gravity. It is, however, easy to obtain\r\n       more concentrated solutions, and at 0° solutions approaching\r\n       NH_{3},H_{2}O (48·6 p.c. NH_{3}) in their composition, and of\r\n       sp. gr. 0·85, may be prepared. But such solutions give up the\r\n       bulk of their ammonia at the ordinary temperature, so that more\r\n       than 24 p.c. NH_{3} is rarely contained in solution. Ammoniacal\r\n       solutions containing a considerable amount of ammonia give\r\n       ice-like crystals which seem to contain ammonia at temperatures\r\n       far below 0° (for instance, an 8 p.c. solution at -14°, the\r\n       strongest solutions at -48°). The whole of the ammonia may be\r\n       expelled from a solution by heating, even at a comparatively\r\n       low temperature; hence on heating aqueous solutions containing\r\n       ammonia a very strong solution of ammonia is obtained in the\r\n       distillate. Alcohol, ether, and many other liquids are also\r\n       capable of dissolving ammonia. Solutions of ammonia, when exposed\r\n       to the atmosphere, give off a part of their ammonia in accordance\r\n       with the laws of the solution of gases in liquids, which we have\r\n       already considered. But the ammoniacal solutions at the same time\r\n       absorb carbonic anhydride from the air, and ammonium carbonate\r\n       remains in the solution.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Apparatus for preparing solutions of\r\n       ammonia.]\r\n\r\n       Solutions of ammonia are required both for laboratory and factory\r\n       operations, and have therefore to be frequently prepared. For\r\n       this purpose the arrangement shown in fig. 46 is employed in the\r\n       laboratory. In works the same arrangement is used, only on a\r\n       larger scale (with earthenware or metallic vessels). The gas is\r\n       prepared in the retort, from whence it is led into the two-necked\r\n       globe A, and then through a series of Woulfe's bottles, B, C,\r\n       D, E. The impurities spurting over collect in A, and the gas is\r\n       dissolved in B, but the solution soon becomes saturated, and a\r\n       purer (washed) ammonia passes over into the following vessels,\r\n       in which only a pure solution is obtained. The bent funnel tube\r\n       in the retort preserves the apparatus from the possibility both\r\n       of the pressure of the gas evolved in it becoming too great\r\n       (when the gas escapes through it into the air), and also from\r\n       the pressure incidentally falling too low (for instance, owing\r\n       to a cooling effect, or from the reaction stopping). If this\r\n       takes place, the air passes into the retort, otherwise the liquid\r\n       from B would be drawn into A. The safety tubes in each Woulfe's\r\n       bottle, open at both ends, and immersed in the liquid, serve for\r\n       the same purpose. Without them, in case of an accidental stoppage\r\n       in the evolution of so soluble a gas as ammonia, the solution\r\n       would be sucked from one vessel to another--for instance, from\r\n       E into D, &c. In order to clearly see the necessity for _safety\r\n       tubes_ in a gas apparatus, it must be remembered that the\r\n       _gaseous pressure_ in the interior of the arrangement must exceed\r\n       the atmospheric pressure by the height of the sum of the columns\r\n       of liquid through which the gas has to pass.\r\n\r\n  [13] The analogy between the ammonium and sodium salts might seem to\r\n       be destroyed by the fact that the latter are formed from the\r\n       alkali or oxide and an acid, with the separation of water, whilst\r\n       the ammonium salts are directly formed from ammonia and an acid,\r\n       without the separation of water; but the analogy is restored\r\n       if we compare soda to ammonia water, and liken caustic soda to\r\n       a compound of ammonia with water. Then the very preparation of\r\n       ammonium salts from such a hydrate of ammonia will completely\r\n       resemble the preparation of sodium salts from soda. We may cite\r\n       as an example the action of hydrochloric acid on both substances.\r\n\r\n           NaHO          +         HCl         =  H_{2}O  +     NaCl\r\n       Sodium hydroxide     Hydrochloric acid      Water     Table salt\r\n\r\n            NH_{4}HO      +         HCl         =  H_{2}0  +   NH_{4}Cl\r\n       Ammonium hydroxide    Hydrochloric acid      Water    Sal-ammoniac\r\n\r\n       Just as in soda the hydroxyl or aqueous radicle OH is replaced by\r\n       chlorine, so it is in ammonia hydrate.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that ammoniacal salts correspond with a complex metal\r\nammonium bears the name of the _ammonium theory_. It was enunciated\r\nby the famous Swedish chemist Berzelius after the proposition made by\r\nAmpère. The analogy admitted between ammonium and metals is probable,\r\nowing to the fact that mercury is able to form an amalgam with ammonium\r\nsimilar to that which it forms with sodium or many other metals. The\r\nonly difference between ammonium amalgam and sodium amalgam consists in\r\nthe instability of the ammonium, which easily decomposes into ammonia\r\nand hydrogen.[14] Ammonium amalgam may be prepared from sodium amalgam.\r\nIf the latter be shaken up with a strong solution of sal-ammoniac, the\r\nmercury swells up violently and loses its mobility whilst preserving its\r\nmetallic appearance. In so doing, the mercury dissolves ammonium--that\r\nis, the sodium in the mercury is replaced by the ammonium, and replaces\r\nit in the sal-ammoniac, forming sodium chloride, NH_{4}Cl + HgNa =\r\nNaCl + HgNH_{4}. Naturally, the formation of ammonium amalgam does not\r\nentirely prove the existence of ammonium itself in a separate state; but\r\nit shows the possibility of this substance existing, and its analogy\r\nwith the metals, because only metals dissolve in mercury.[15] Ammonium\r\namalgam crystallises in cubes, three times heavier than water; it is\r\nonly stable in the cold, and particularly at very low temperatures. It\r\nbegins to decompose at the ordinary temperature, evolving ammonia and\r\nhydrogen in the proportion of two volumes of ammonia and one volume\r\nof hydrogen, NH_{4} = NH_{3} + H. By the action of water, ammonium\r\namalgam gives hydrogen and ammonia water, just as sodium amalgam gives\r\nhydrogen and sodium hydroxide; and therefore, in accordance with\r\nthe ammonium theory, ammonia water must be looked on as containing\r\nammonium hydroxide, NH_{4}OH,[16] just as an aqueous solution of sodium\r\nhydroxide, contains NaOH. The ammonium hydroxide, like ammonium itself,\r\nis an unstable substance, which easily dissociates, and can only exist\r\nin a free state at low temperatures.[17] Ordinary solutions of ammonia\r\nmust be looked on as the products of the dissociation of this hydroxide,\r\ninasmuch as NH_{4}OH = NH_{3} + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [14] Weyl (1864) by subjecting sodium to the action of ammonia at\r\n       the ordinary temperature and under considerable pressures,\r\n       obtained a liquid, which was subsequently investigated by Joannis\r\n       (1889), who confirmed the results obtained by Weyl. At 0° and the\r\n       atmospheric pressure the composition of this substance is Na +\r\n       5·3NH_{3}. The removal (at 0°) of ammonia from the liquid gives\r\n       a solid copper-red body having the composition NH_{3}Na. The\r\n       determination of the molecular weight of this substance by the\r\n       fall of the tension of liquid ammonia gave N_{2}H_{6}Na_{2}. It\r\n       is, therefore, free ammonium in which one H is replaced by Na.\r\n       The compound with potassium, obtained under the same conditions,\r\n       proved to have an analogous composition. By the decomposition of\r\n       NH_{3}Na at the ordinary temperature, Joannis (1891) obtained\r\n       hydrogen and sodium-amide NH_{2}Na in small colourless crystals\r\n       which were soluble in water. The addition of liquid ammonia to\r\n       metallic sodium and a saturated solution of sodium chloride,\r\n       gives NH_{2}Na_{2}Cl, and this substance is sal-ammoniac, in\r\n       which H_{2} is replaced by Na_{2}.\r\n\r\n       If pure oxygen be passed through a solution of these compounds\r\n       in ammonia at a temperature of about -50°, it is seen that the\r\n       gas is rapidly absorbed. The liquid gradually loses its dark\r\n       red colour and becomes lighter, and when it has become quite\r\n       colourless a gelatinous precipitate is thrown down. After the\r\n       removal of the ammonia, this precipitate dissolves easily in\r\n       water with a considerable evolution of heat, but without giving\r\n       off any gaseous products. The composition of the sodium compound\r\n       thus obtained is NH_{2}Na_{2}HO, which shows that it is a hydrate\r\n       of bisodium-ammonium. Thus, although free ammonium has not been\r\n       obtained, still a sodium substitution product of it is known\r\n       which corresponds to it as a salt to a hydrate. Ammonium amalgam\r\n       was originally obtained in exactly the same way as sodium amalgam\r\n       (Davy); namely, a piece of sal-ammoniac was taken, and moistened\r\n       with water (in order to render it a conductor of electricity). A\r\n       cavity was made in it, into which mercury was poured, and it was\r\n       laid on a sheet of platinum connected with the positive pole of a\r\n       galvanic battery, while the negative pole was put into connection\r\n       with the mercury. On passing a current the mercury increased\r\n       considerably in volume, and became plastic, whilst preserving\r\n       its metallic appearance, just as would be the case were the\r\n       sal-ammoniac replaced by a lump of a sodium salt or of many other\r\n       metals. In the analogous decomposition of common metallic salts,\r\n       the metal contained in a given salt separates out at the negative\r\n       pole, immersed in mercury, by which the metal is dissolved. A\r\n       similar phenomenon is observed in the case of sal-ammoniac; the\r\n       elements of ammonium, NH_{4}, in this case are also collected in\r\n       the mercury, and are retained by it for a certain time.\r\n\r\n  [15] We may mention, however, that under particular conditions hydrogen\r\n       is also capable of forming an amalgam resembling the amalgam of\r\n       ammonium. If an amalgam of zinc be shaken up with an aqueous\r\n       solution of platinum chloride, without access of air, then a\r\n       spongy mass is formed which easily decomposes, with the evolution\r\n       of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [16] We saw above that the solubility of ammonia in water at low\r\n       temperatures attains to the molecular ratio NH_{3} + H_{2}O, in\r\n       which these substances are contained in caustic ammonia, and\r\n       perhaps it may be possible at exceedingly low temperatures to\r\n       obtain ammonium hydroxide, NH_{4}HO, in a solid form. Regarding\r\n       solutions as dissociated definite compounds, we should see a\r\n       confirmation of this view in the property shown by ammonia of\r\n       being extremely soluble in water, and in so doing of approaching\r\n       to the limit NH_{4}HO.\r\n\r\n  [17] In confirmation of the truth of this conclusion we may cite the\r\n       remarkable fact that there exist, in a free state and as\r\n       comparatively stable compounds, a series of alkaline hydroxides,\r\n       NR_{4}HO, which are perfectly analogous to ammonium hydroxide,\r\n       and present a striking resemblance to it and to sodium hydroxide,\r\n       with the only difference that the hydrogen in NH_{4}HO is\r\n       replaced by complex groups, R = CH_{3}, C_{2}H_{5}, &c., for\r\n       instance N(CH_{3})_{4}HO. Details will be found in organic\r\n       chemistry.\r\n\r\nAll ammoniacal salts _decompose at a red heat_ into ammonia and an acid,\r\nwhich, on cooling in contact with each other, re-combine together. If\r\nthe acid be non-volatile, the ammoniacal salt, when heated, evolves the\r\nammonia, leaving the non-volatile acid behind; if the acid be volatile,\r\nthen, on heating, both the acid and ammonia volatilise together, and\r\non cooling re-combine into the salt which originally served for the\r\nformation of their vapours.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] The fact that ammoniacal salts are decomposed when ignited, and not\r\n       simply sublimed, may be proved by a direct experiment with\r\n       sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, which in a state of vapour is decomposed\r\n       into ammonia, NH_{3}, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, as will be\r\n       explained in the following chapter. The readiness with which\r\n       ammonium salts decompose is seen from the fact that a solution\r\n       of ammonium oxalate is decomposed with the evolution of ammonia\r\n       even at -1°. Dilute solutions of ammonium salts, when boiled give\r\n       aqueous vapour having an alkaline reaction, owing to the presence\r\n       of free ammonia given off from the salt.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is not only capable of combining with acids, but also with many\r\nsalts, as was seen from its forming definite compounds, AgCl,3NH_{3}\r\nand 2AgCl,3NH_{3}, with silver chloride. Just as ammonia is absorbed\r\nby various oxygen salts of the metals, so also is it absorbed by the\r\nchlorine, iodine, and bromine compounds of many metals, and in so doing\r\nevolves heat. Certain of these compounds part with their ammonia even\r\nwhen left exposed to the air, but others only do so at a red heat; many\r\ngive up their ammonia when dissolved, whilst others dissolve without\r\ndecomposition, and when evaporated separate from their solutions\r\nunchanged. All these facts only indicate that ammoniacal, like aqueous,\r\ncompounds dissociate with greater or lesser facility.[19] Certain\r\nmetallic oxides also absorb ammonia and are dissolved in ammonia water.\r\nSuch are, for instance, the oxides of zinc, nickel, copper, and many\r\nothers; the majority of such compounds are unstable. The property of\r\nammonia of combining with certain oxides explains its action on certain\r\nmetals.[20] By reason of such action, copper vessels are not suitable\r\nfor holding liquids containing ammonia. Iron is not acted on by such\r\nliquids.\r\n\r\n  [19] Isambert studied the dissociation of ammoniacal compounds, as we\r\n       have seen in Note 8, and showed that at low temperatures many\r\n       salts are able to combine with a still greater amount of\r\n       ammonia, which proves an entire analogy with hydrates; and as\r\n       in this case it is easy to isolate the definite compounds, and\r\n       as the least possible tension of ammonia is greater than that\r\n       of water, therefore the ammoniacal compounds present a great\r\n       and peculiar interest, as a means for explaining the nature of\r\n       aqueous solutions and as a confirmation of the hypothesis of\r\n       the formation of definite compounds in them; for these reasons\r\n       we shall frequently refer to these compounds in the further\r\n       exposition of this work.\r\n\r\n  [20] Chapter V., Note 2.\r\n\r\nThe similarity between the relation of ammonia and water to salts and\r\nother substances is more especially marked in those cases in which\r\nthe salt is capable of combining with both ammonia and water. Take,\r\nfor example, copper sulphate, CuSO_{4}. As we saw in Chapter I., it\r\ngives with water blue crystals, CuSO_{4},5H_{2}O; but it also absorbs\r\nammonia in the same molecular proportion, forming a blue substance,\r\nCuSO_{4},5NH_{3}, and therefore the ammonia combining with salts may be\r\ntermed _ammonia of crystallisation_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the _reactions of combination_ proper to ammonia. Let us\r\nnow turn our attention to the reactions of substitution proper to\r\nthis substance. If ammonia be passed through a heated tube containing\r\nmetallic sodium, hydrogen is evolved, and a compound is obtained\r\ncontaining ammonia in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by an\r\natom of sodium, NH_{2}Na (according to the equation NH_{3} + Na =\r\nNH_{2}Na + H). This body is termed sodium amide. We shall afterwards\r\nsee that iodine and chlorine are also capable of directly displacing\r\nhydrogen from ammonia, and of replacing it. In fact, the hydrogen of\r\nammonia may be replaced in many ways by different elements. If in this\r\nreplacement NH_{2} remains, the resultant substances NH_{2}R are called\r\n_amides_, whilst the substitution products, NHR_{2}, in which only NH\r\nremains, are called _imides_,[20 bis] and those in which none of the\r\nammoniacal hydrogen remains, NR_{3}, are known as _nitrides_. Free\r\namidogen, N_{2}H_{4}, is now known in a state of hydration under the\r\nname of hydrazine;[21] it combines with acids and resembles ammonia in\r\nthis respect. In the action of different substances on ammonia it is\r\nthe _hydrogen that is substituted_, whilst the nitrogen remains in the\r\nresultant compound, so to say, untouched. The same phenomenon is to be\r\nobserved in the action of various substances on water. In the majority\r\nof cases the reactions of water consist in the hydrogen being evolved,\r\nand in its being replaced by different elements. This also takes place,\r\nas we have seen, in acids in which the hydrogen is easily displaced by\r\nmetals. This chemical mobility of hydrogen is perhaps connected with the\r\ngreat lightness of the atoms of this element.\r\n\r\n  [20 bis] Imide, NH, has not been obtained in a free state, but its\r\n       hydrochloric acid salt, NHHCl, has apparently been obtained (1890)\r\n       by Maumené by igniting the double bichloride of platinum and\r\n       ammonium chloride, PtCl_{2}NH_{4}Cl = Pt + 2HCl + NHHCl. It is\r\n       soluble in water, and crystallises from its solution in hexagonal\r\n       rhombic prisms. It gives a double salt with FeCl_{3} of the\r\n       composition FeCl_{3}3NHHCl. The salt NHHCl is similar (isomeric)\r\n       with the first possible product of the metalepsis of ammonia,\r\n       NH_{2}Cl, although it does not resemble it in any of its\r\n       properties.\r\n\r\n  [21] Free _amidogen_ or _hydrazine_, N_{2}H_{4}, or 2NH_{2}, was\r\n       prepared by Curtius (1887) by means of ethyl diazoacetate,\r\n       or triazoacetic acid. Curtius and Jay (1889) showed that\r\n       triazoacetic acid, CHN_{2}.COOH (the formula should be tripled),\r\n       when heated with water or a mineral acid, gives (quantitatively)\r\n       oxalic acid and amidogen (hydrazine), CHN_{2}.COOH + 2H_{2}O =\r\n       C_{2}O_{2}(OH)_{2} + N_{2}H_{4}--_i.e._ (empirically), the oxygen\r\n       of the water replaces the nitrogen of the azoacetic acid. The\r\n       amidogen is thus obtained in the form of a salt. With acids,\r\n       amidogen forms very stable salts of the two types N_{2}H_{4}HX\r\n       and N_[2]H_{4}H_{2}X_{2}, as, for example, with HCl, H_{2}SO_{4},\r\n       &c. These salts are easily crystallised; in acid solutions\r\n       they act as powerful reducing agents, evolving nitrogen; when\r\n       ignited they are decomposed into ammoniacal salts, nitrogen,\r\n       and hydrogen; with nitrites they evolve nitrogen. The sulphate\r\n       N_{2}H_{4},H_{2}SO_{4} is sparingly soluble in cold water (3\r\n       parts in 100 of water), but is very soluble in hot water; its\r\n       specific gravity is 1·378, it fuses at 254° with decomposition.\r\n       The hydrochloride N_{2}H_{4},2HCl crystallises in octahedra, is\r\n       very soluble in water, but not in alcohol; it fuses at 198°,\r\n       evolving hydrogen chloride and forming the salt N_{2}H_{4}HCl;\r\n       when rapidly heated it decomposes with an explosion; with\r\n       platinic chloride it immediately evolves nitrogen, forming\r\n       platinous chloride. By the action of alkalis the salts\r\n       N_{2}H_{4},2HX give _hydrate of amidogen_, N_{2}H_{4},H_{2}O,\r\n       which is a fuming liquid (specific gravity 1·03), boiling at\r\n       119°, almost without odour, and whose aqueous solution corrodes\r\n       glass and india-rubber, has an alkaline taste and poisonous\r\n       properties. The reducing capacities of the hydrate are clearly\r\n       seen from the fact that it reduces the metals platinum and\r\n       silver from their solutions. With mercuric oxide it explodes. It\r\n       reacts directly with the aldehydes RO, forming N_{2}R_{2} and\r\n       water; for example, with benzaldehydes it gives the very stable\r\n       insoluble _benzalazine_ (C_{6}H_{5}CHN)_{2} of a yellow colour.\r\n       We may add that hydrazine often forms double salts; for example,\r\n       MgSO_{4}N_{2}H_{4}H_{2}SO_{4} or KClN_{2}H_{4}HCl, and that it is\r\n       also formed by the action of nitrous acid upon aldehyde-ammonia.\r\n       The products of the substitution of the hydrogen in hydrazine by\r\n       hydrocarbon groups R (R = CH_{3}, C_{2}H_{5}, C_{6}H_{5}, &c.)\r\n       were obtained before hydrazine itself; for example, NHRNH_{2},\r\n       NR_{2}NH_{2}, and (NRH)_{2}.\r\n\r\n       The heat of solution of the sulphuric acid salt (1 part in 200\r\n       and 300 parts of water at 10°·8) is equal to -8·7 C. According\r\n       to Berthelot and Matigon (1892), the heat of neutralisation of\r\n       hydrazine by sulphuric acid is +5·5 C and by hydrochloric acid\r\n       +5·2 C. Thus hydrazine is a very feeble base, for its heat of\r\n       saturation is not only lower than that of ammonia (+12·4 C.\r\n       for HCl), but even below that of hydroxylamine (+9·3 C.) The\r\n       heat of formation from the elements of hydrated hydrazine -9·5 C\r\n       was deduced from the heat of combustion, determined by burning\r\n       N_{2}H_{4}H_{2}SO_{4} in a calorimetric bomb, +127·7 C. Thus\r\n       hydrazine is an endothermal compound; its passage into ammonia\r\n       by the combination of hydrogen is accompanied by the evolution\r\n       of 51·5 C. In the presence of an acid these figures were greater\r\n       by +14·4 C. Hence the direct converse passage from ammonia into\r\n       hydrazine is impossible. As regards the passage of hydroxylamine\r\n       into hydrazine, it would be accompanied by the evolution of heat\r\n       (+21·5 C.) in an aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n       Amidogen must be regarded as a compound which stands to ammonia\r\n       in the same relation as hydrogen peroxide stands to water.\r\n       Water, H(OH), gives, according to the law of substitution,\r\n       as was clearly to be expected, (OH)(OH)--that is, peroxide\r\n       of hydrogen is the free radicle of water (hydroxyl). So also\r\n       ammonia, H(NH_{2}), forms hydrazine, (NH_{2})(NH_{2})--that is,\r\n       the free radicle of ammonia, NH_{2}, or amidogen. In the case of\r\n       phosphorus a similar substance, as we shall afterwards see, has\r\n       long been known under the name of liquid phosphuretted hydrogen,\r\n       P_{2}H_{4}.\r\n\r\nIn practical chemistry[21 bis] ammonia is often employed, not only\r\nfor saturating acids, but also for effecting reactions of double\r\ndecomposition with salts, and especially for separating insoluble\r\nbasic hydroxides from soluble salts. Let MHO stand for an insoluble\r\nbasic hydroxide and HX for an acid. The salt formed by them will have a\r\ncomposition MHO + XH-H_{2}O = MX. If aqueous ammonia, NH_{4}OH, be added\r\nto a solution of this salt, the ammonia will change places with the\r\nmetal M, and thus form the insoluble basic hydroxide, or, as it is said,\r\ngive a precipitate.\r\n\r\n         MX          +    NH_{4}(OH)    =    NH_{4}X     +     MHO\r\n  Salt of the metal.   Aqueous ammonia.   Ammonium salt.   Basic hydrate.\r\n    In solution          In solution        In solution    As precipitate\r\n\r\n  [21 bis] In practice, the applications of ammonia are very varied. The\r\n       use of ammonia as a stimulant, in the forms of the so-called\r\n       'smelling salts' or of spirits of hartshorn, in cases of\r\n       faintness, &c., is known to everyone. The volatile carbonate of\r\n       ammonium, or a mixture of an ammonium salt with an alkali, is also\r\n       employed for this purpose. Ammonia also produces a well-known\r\n       stimulating effect when rubbed on the skin, for which reason it is\r\n       sometimes employed for external applications. Thus, for instance,\r\n       the well-known volatile salve is prepared from any liquid oil\r\n       shaken up with a solution of ammonia. A portion of the oil is thus\r\n       transformed into a soapy substance. The solubility of greasy\r\n       substances in ammonia, which proceeds from the formation both of\r\n       emulsions and soaps, explains its use in extracting grease spots.\r\n       It is also employed as an external application for stings from\r\n       insects, and for bites from poisonous snakes, and in general in\r\n       medicine. It is also remarkable that in cases of drunkenness a few\r\n       drops of ammonia in water taken internally rapidly renders a\r\n       person sober. A large quantity of ammonia is used in dyeing,\r\n       either for the solution of certain dyes--for example, carmine--or\r\n       for changing the tints of others, or else for neutralising the\r\n       action of acids. It is also employed in the manufacture of\r\n       artificial pearls. For this purpose the small scales of a peculiar\r\n       small fish are mixed with ammonia, and the liquid so obtained is\r\n       blown into small hollow glass beads shaped like pearls.\r\n\r\n       In nature and the arts, however, ammonium salts, and not free\r\n       ammonia, are most frequently employed. In this form a portion of\r\n       that _nitrogen_ which is necessary for the formation of albuminous\r\n       substances is _supplied to plants_. Owing to this, a large\r\n       quantity of ammonium sulphate is now employed as a fertilising\r\n       substance. But the same effect may be produced by nitre, or by\r\n       animal refuse, which in decomposing gives ammonia. For this\r\n       reason, an ammoniacal (hydrogen) compound may be introduced into\r\n       the soil in the spring which will be converted into a nitrate\r\n       (oxygen salt) in the summer.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, if aqueous ammonia is added to a solution of a salt\r\nof aluminium, then alumina hydrate is separated out as a colourless\r\ngelatinous precipitate.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] As certain basic hydrates form peculiar compounds with ammonia,\r\n       in some cases it happens that the first portions of ammonia\r\n       added to a solution of a salt produce a precipitate, whilst\r\n       the addition of a fresh quantity of ammonia dissolves this\r\n       precipitate if the ammoniacal compound of the base be soluble in\r\n       water. This, for example, takes place with the copper salts. But\r\n       alumina does not dissolve under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn order to grasp the relation between ammonia and the oxygen\r\ncompounds of nitrogen it is necessary to recognise the general\r\n_law of substitution_, applicable to all cases of substitution\r\nbetween elements,[23] and therefore showing what may be the cases of\r\nsubstitution between oxygen and hydrogen as component parts of water.\r\nThe law of substitution may be deduced from mechanical principles if\r\nthe molecule be conceived as a system of elementary atoms occurring\r\nin a certain chemical and mechanical equilibrium. By likening the\r\nmolecule to a system of bodies in a state of motion--for instance,\r\nto the sum total of the sun, planets, and satellites, existing in\r\nconditions of mobile equilibrium--then we should expect the action\r\nof one part, in this system, to be equal and opposite to the other,\r\naccording to Newton's third law of mechanics. Hence, given a molecule\r\nof a compound, for instance, H_{2}O, NH_{3}, NaCl, HCl, &c., its every\r\ntwo parts must in a chemical sense represent two things somewhat\r\nalike in force and properties, and therefore _every two parts into\r\nwhich a molecule of a compound may be divided are capable of replacing\r\neach other_. In order that the application of the law should become\r\nclear it is evident that among compounds the most stable should be\r\nchosen. We will therefore take hydrochloric acid and water as the\r\nmost stable compounds of hydrogen.[24] According to the above law of\r\nsubstitution, if the elements H and Cl are able to form a molecule, HCl,\r\nand a stable one, they are able to replace each other. And, indeed,\r\nwe shall afterwards see (Chapter XI.) that in a number of instances a\r\nsubstitution between hydrogen and chlorine can take place. Given RH,\r\nthen RCl is possible, because HCl exists and is stable. The molecule of\r\nwater, H_{2}O, may be divided in two ways, because it contains 3 atoms:\r\ninto H and (HO) on the one hand, and into H_{2} and O on the other.\r\nConsequently, being given RH, its substitution products will be R(HO)\r\naccording to the first form, and R_{2}O according to the second; being\r\ngiven RH_{2}, its corresponding substitution products will be RH(OH),\r\nR(OH)_{2}, RO, (RH)_{2}O, &c. The group (OH) is the same hydroxyl or\r\naqueous radicle which we have already mentioned in the third chapter\r\nas a component part of hydroxides and alkalis--for instance, Na(OH),\r\nCa(OH)_{2}, &c. It is evident, judging from H(HO) and HCl, that (OH)\r\ncan be substituted by Cl, because both are replaceable by H; and this\r\nis of common occurrence in chemistry, because metallic chlorides--for\r\nexample, NaCl and NH_{4}Cl--correspond with hydroxides of the alkalis\r\nNa(OH) or NH_{4}(OH). In hydrocarbons--for instance, C_{2}H_{6}--the\r\nhydrogen is replaceable by chlorine and by hydroxyl. Thus ordinary\r\nalcohol is C_{2}H_{6}, in which one atom of H is replaced by (OH); that\r\nis, C_{2}H_{5}(OH). It is evident that the replacement of hydrogen by\r\nhydroxyl essentially forms the phenomenon of oxidation, because RH gives\r\nR(OH), or RHO. Hydrogen peroxide may in this sense be regarded as water\r\nin which the hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl; H(OH) gives (OH)_{2} or\r\nH_{2}O_{2}. The other form of substitution--namely, that of O in the\r\nplace of H_{2}--is also a common chemical phenomenon. Thus alcohol,\r\nC_{2}H_{6}O, or C_{2}H_{5}(OH), when oxidising in the air, gives acetic\r\nacid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}, or C_{2}H_{3}O(OH), in which H_{2} is replaced\r\nby O.\r\n\r\n  [23] When the element chlorine, as we shall afterwards more fully\r\n       learn, replaces the element hydrogen, the reaction by which\r\n       such an exchange is accomplished proceeds as a substitution, AH\r\n       + Cl_{2} = ACl + HCl, so that two substances, AH and chlorine,\r\n       react on each other, and two substances, ACl and HCl, are\r\n       formed; and further, two molecules react on each other, and\r\n       two others are formed. The reaction proceeds very easily, but\r\n       the substitution of one element, _A_, by another, _X_, does\r\n       not always proceed with such ease, clearness, or simplicity.\r\n       The substitution between oxygen and hydrogen is very rarely\r\n       accomplished by the reaction of the free elements, but the\r\n       substitution between these elements, one for another, forms\r\n       the most common case of oxidation and reduction. In speaking\r\n       of the law of substitution, I have in view the substitution of\r\n       the elements one by another, and not the direct reaction of\r\n       substitution. The law of substitution determines the cycle of the\r\n       combinations of a given element, if a few of its compounds (for\r\n       instance, the hydrogen compounds) be known. A development of the\r\n       conceptions of the law of substitution may be found in my lecture\r\n       given at the Royal Institution in London, 1889.\r\n\r\n  [24] If hydrogen peroxide be taken as a starting point, then still\r\n       higher forms of oxidation than those corresponding with water\r\n       should be looked for. They should possess the properties of\r\n       hydrogen peroxide, especially that of parting with their oxygen\r\n       with extreme ease (even by contact). Such compounds are known.\r\n       Pernitric, persulphuric, and similar acids present these\r\n       properties, as we shall see in describing them.\r\n\r\nIn the further course of this work we shall have occasion to refer to\r\nthe law of substitution for explaining many chemical phenomena and\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nWe will now apply these conceptions to ammonia in order to see its\r\nrelation to the oxygen compounds of nitrogen. It is evident that many\r\nsubstances should be obtainable from ammonia, NH_{3}, or aqueous\r\nammonia, NH_{4}(OH), by substituting their hydrogen by hydroxyl,\r\nor H_{2} by oxygen. And such is the case. The two extreme cases of\r\nsuch substitution will be as follows: (1) One atom of H in NH_{3} is\r\nsubstituted by (OH), and NH_{2}(OH) is produced. Such a substance, still\r\ncontaining much hydrogen, should have many of the properties of ammonia.\r\nIt is known under the name of _hydroxylamine_,[25] and, in fact, is\r\ncapable, like ammonia, of giving salts with acids; for example, with\r\nhydrochloric acid, NH_{3}(OH)Cl--which is a substance corresponding to\r\nsal-ammoniac, in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl.[25\r\nbis] (2) The other extreme case of substitution is that given by\r\nammonium hydroxide, NH_{4}(OH), when the whole of the hydrogen of the\r\nammonium is replaced by oxygen; and, as ammonium contains 4 atoms of\r\nhydrogen, the highest oxygen compound should be NO_{2}(OH), or NHO_{3},\r\nas we find to be really the case, for NHO_{3} is nitric acid, exhibiting\r\nthe highest degree of oxidation of nitrogen.[26] If instead of the two\r\nextreme aspects of substitution we take an intermediate one, we obtain\r\nthe intermediate oxygen compounds of nitrogen. For instance, N(OH)_{3}\r\nis orthonitrous acid,[27] to which corresponds nitrous acid, NO(OH), or\r\nNHO_{2}, equal to N(OH)_{3}-H_{2}O, and nitrous anhydride, N_{2}O_{3} =\r\n2N(OH)_{3}-3H_{2}O. Thus nitrogen gives a series of oxygen compounds,\r\nwhich we will proceed to describe. We will, however, first show by\r\ntwo examples that in the first place the passage of ammonia into the\r\noxygen compounds of nitrogen up to nitric acid, as well as the converse\r\npreparation of ammonia (and consequently of the intermediate compounds\r\nalso) from nitric acid, are reactions which proceed directly and easily\r\nunder many circumstances, and in the second place that the above general\r\nprinciple of substitution gives the possibility of understanding many,\r\nat first sight unexpected and complex, relations and transformations,\r\nsuch as the preparation of hydronitrous acid, HN_{3}. In nature the\r\nmatter is complicated by a number of influences and circumstances, but\r\nin the law the relations are presented in their simplest aspect.\r\n\r\n  [25] The compound of hydroxylamine with hydrochloric acid has the\r\n       composition NH_{2}(OH)HCl = NH_{4}ClO--that is, it is as it were\r\n       oxidised sal-ammoniac. It was prepared by Lossen in 1865 by the\r\n       action of tin and hydrochloric acid in the presence of water on\r\n       a substance called ethyl nitrate, in which case the hydrogen\r\n       liberated from the hydrochloric acid by the tin acts upon the\r\n       elements of nitric acid--\r\n\r\n       C_{2}H_{5}·NO_{3} + 6H + HCl = NH_{4}OCl + H_{2}O + C_{2}H_{5}·OH\r\n         Ethyl nitrate  Hydrogen     Hydroxylamine  Water      Alcohol\r\n                          from           + HCl\r\n                       HCl and Sn\r\n\r\n       Thus in this case the nitric acid is deoxidised, not directly\r\n       into nitrogen, but into hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine is also\r\n       formed by passing nitric oxide, NO, into a mixture of tin and\r\n       hydrochloric acid--that is, by the action of the hydrogen evolved\r\n       on the nitric oxide, NO + 3H + HCl = NH_{4}OCl--and in many other\r\n       cases. According to Lossen's method, a mixture of 30 parts of\r\n       ethyl nitrate, 120 parts of tin, and 40 parts of a solution of\r\n       hydrochloric acid of sp. gr. 1·06 are taken. After a certain\r\n       time the reaction commences spontaneously. When the reaction\r\n       has ceased the tin is separated by means of hydrogen sulphide,\r\n       the solution is evaporated, and a large amount of sal-ammoniac\r\n       is thus obtained (owing to the further action of hydrogen on\r\n       the hydroxylamine compound, the hydrogen taking up oxygen from\r\n       it and forming water); a solution ultimately remains containing\r\n       the hydroxylamine salt; this salt is dissolved in anhydrous\r\n       alcohol and purified by the addition of platinum chloride, which\r\n       precipitates any ammonium salt still remaining in the solution.\r\n       After concentrating the alcoholic solution the hydroxylamine\r\n       hydrochloride separates in crystals. This substance melts at\r\n       about 150°, and in so doing decomposes into nitrogen, hydrogen\r\n       chloride, water, and sal-ammoniac. A sulphuric acid compound of\r\n       hydroxylamine may be obtained by mixing a solution of the above\r\n       salt with sulphuric acid. The sulphate is also soluble in water\r\n       like the hydrochloride; this shows that hydroxylamine, like\r\n       ammonia itself, forms a series of salts in which one acid may\r\n       be substituted for another. It might he expected that by mixing\r\n       a strong solution of a hydroxylamine salt with a solution of a\r\n       caustic alkali hydroxylamine itself would be liberated, just\r\n       as an ammonia salt under these circumstances evolves ammonia;\r\n       but the liberated hydroxylamine is immediately decomposed with\r\n       the formation of nitrogen and ammonia (and probably nitrous\r\n       oxide), 3NH_{3}O = NH_{3} + 3H_{2}O + N_{2}. Dilute solutions\r\n       give the same reaction, although very slowly, but by decomposing\r\n       a solution of the sulphate with barium hydroxide a certain\r\n       amount of hydroxylamine is obtained in solution (it is partly\r\n       decomposed). Hydroxylamine in aqueous solution, like ammonia,\r\n       precipitates basic hydrates, and it deoxidises the oxides of\r\n       copper, silver, and other metals. Free hydroxylamine was obtained\r\n       by Lobry de Bruyn (1891). It is a solid, colourless, crystalline\r\n       substance, without odour, which does not melt below 27°. It has\r\n       the property of dissolving metallic salts; for instance, sodium\r\n       chloride. Hydroxylamine, when rapidly heated with platinum,\r\n       decomposes with a flash and the formation of a yellow flame.\r\n       It is almost insoluble in ordinary solvents like chloroform,\r\n       benzine, acetic ether, and carbon bisulphide. Its aqueous\r\n       solutions are tolerably stable, contain up to 60 per cent.\r\n       (sp. gr. 1·15 at 20°), and may be kept for many weeks without\r\n       undergoing any change. Lobry de Bruyn used the hydrochloric\r\n       salt to prepare pure hydroxylamine. The salt was first treated\r\n       with sodium methylate (CH_{3}NaO), and then methyl alcohol was\r\n       added to the mixture. The precipitated sodium chloride was\r\n       separated from the solution by filtration. (The methyl alcohol\r\n       is added to prevent the precipitated chloride of sodium from\r\n       coating the insoluble hydrochloric salt of hydroxylamine.) The\r\n       methyl alcohol was driven off under a pressure 150-200 mm., and\r\n       after extracting a further portion of methyl alcohol by ether\r\n       and several fractional distillations, a solution was obtained\r\n       containing 70 per cent. of free hydroxylamine, 8 per cent.\r\n       water, 9·9 per cent. chloride of sodium, and 12·1 per cent. of\r\n       the hydrochloric salt of hydroxylamine. Pure free hydroxylamine,\r\n       NH_{3}O, is obtained by distilling under a pressure of 60 mm.;\r\n       it then boils at 70°, and solidifies in a condenser cooled to\r\n       0° in the form of long needles. It melts at 33°, boils at 58°\r\n       under a pressure of 22 mm., and has a sp. gr. of about 1·235\r\n       (Brühl). Under the action of NaHO it gives NH_{3} and NHO_{2}\r\n       or N_{2}O, and forms nitric acid (Kolotoff, 1893) under the\r\n       action of oxidising agents. Hydroxylamine is obtained in a great\r\n       number of cases, for instance by the action of tin on dilute\r\n       nitric acid, and also by the action of zinc on ethyl nitrate and\r\n       dilute hydrochloric acid, &c. The relation between hydroxylamine,\r\n       NH_{2}(OH), and nitrous acid, NO(OH), which is so clear in the\r\n       sense of the law of substitutions, becomes a reality in those\r\n       cases when reducing agents act on salts of nitrous acid. Thus\r\n       Raschig (1888) proposed the following method for the preparation\r\n       of the hydroxylamine sulphate. A mixture of strong solutions of\r\n       potassium nitrite, KNO_{2}, and hydroxide, KHO, in molecular\r\n       proportions, is prepared and cooled. An excess of sulphurous\r\n       anhydride is then passed into the mixture, and the solution\r\n       boiled for a long time. A mixture of the sulphates of potassium\r\n       and hydroxylamine is thus obtained: KNO_{2} + KHO + 2SO_{2} +\r\n       2H_{2}O = NH_{2}(OH),H_{2}SO_{4} + K_{2}SO_{4}. The salts may be\r\n       separated from each other by crystallisation.\r\n\r\n  [25 bis] In order to illustrate the application of the law of\r\n       substitution to a given case, and to show the connection between\r\n       ammonia and the oxides of nitrogen, let us consider the possible\r\n       products of an oxygen and hydroxyl substitution in caustic\r\n       ammonia, NH_{4}(OH). It is evident that the substitution of H by\r\n       OH can give: (1) NH_{3}(OH)_{2}; (2) NH_{2}(OH)_{3}; (3)\r\n       NH(OH)_{4}; and (4) N(OH)_{5}. They should all, like caustic\r\n       ammonia itself, easily part with water and form products\r\n       (hydroxylic) of the oxidation of ammonia. The first of them is the\r\n       hydrate of hydroxylamine, NH_{2}(OH) + H_{2}O; the second,\r\n       NH(OH)_{2} + H_{2}O (and also the substance NH(OH)_{4} or\r\n       NH_{3}O_{2}), containing, as it does, both hydrogen and oxygen, is\r\n       able to part with all its hydrogen in the form of water (which\r\n       could not be done by the first product, since it contained too\r\n       little oxygen), forming, as the ultimate product,\r\n       2NH_{2}(OH)_{3}-5H_{2}O = N_{2}O--that is, it corresponds with\r\n       nitrous oxide, or the lower degree of the oxidation of nitrogen.\r\n       So, also, nitrous anhydride corresponds with the third of the\r\n       above products, 2NH(OH)_{4}-5H_{2}O = N_{2}O_{3}, and nitric\r\n       anhydride with the fourth, 2N(OH)_{5}-5H_{2}O = N_{2}O_{5}. As, in\r\n       these three equations, two molecules of the substitution products\r\n       (-5H_{2}O) are taken, it is also possible to combine two different\r\n       products in one equation. For instance, the third and fourth\r\n       products: NH(OH)_{4} + N(OH)_{5}-5H_{2}O corresponds to N_{2}O_{4}\r\n       or 2NO_{2}, that is, to peroxide of nitrogen. Thus all the five\r\n       (see later) oxides of nitrogen, N_{2}O, NO, N_{2}O_{3}, NO_{2},\r\n       and N_{2}O_{5}, may be deduced from ammonia. The above may be\r\n       expressed in a general form by the equation (it should be remarked\r\n       that the composition of all the substitution products of caustic\r\n       ammonia may be expressed by NH_{3}O{5-_a_}, where _a_ varies\r\n       between 0 and 4):\r\n\r\n         NH_{5}O_{5 - _a_} + NH_{5}O{5 - _b_} - 5H_{2}O\r\n                                            = N_{2}O_{5 - (_a_ + _b_)},\r\n\r\n       where _a_ + _b_ can evidently be not greater than 5; when _a_ +\r\n       _b_ = 5 we have N_{2}--nitrogen, when = 4 we have N_{2}O nitrous\r\n       oxide; when _a_ + _b_ = 3 we have N_{2}O_{2} or NO--nitric oxide,\r\n       and so on to N_{2}O_{5}, when _a_ + _b_ = 0. Besides which it is\r\n       evident that intermediate products may correspond with (and hence\r\n       also break up into) different starting points; for instance,\r\n       N_{2}O is obtained when _a_ + _b_ = 2, and this may occur either\r\n       when _a_ = 0 (nitric acid), and _b_ = 2 (hydroxylamine), or when\r\n       _a_ = _b_ = 1 (the third of the above substitution products).\r\n\r\n  [26] Nitric acid corresponds with the anhydride N_{2}O_{5}, which will\r\n       afterwards be described, but which must be regarded as the\r\n       highest saline oxide of nitrogen, just as Na_{2}O (and the\r\n       hydroxide NaHO) in the case of sodium, although sodium forms\r\n       a peroxide possessing the property of parting with its oxygen\r\n       with the same ease as hydrogen peroxide, if not on heating,\r\n       at all events in reactions--for instance, with acids. So also\r\n       nitric acid has its corresponding peroxide, which may be called\r\n       pernitric acid. Its composition is not well known--probably\r\n       NHO_{4}--so that its corresponding anhydride would be N_{2}O_{7}.\r\n       It is formed by the action of a silent discharge on a mixture\r\n       of nitrogen and oxygen, so that a portion of its oxygen is\r\n       in a state similar to that in ozone. The instability of this\r\n       substance (obtained by Hautefeuille, Chappuis, and Berthelot),\r\n       which easily splits up with the formation of nitric peroxide, and\r\n       its resemblance to persulphuric acid, which we shall afterwards\r\n       describe, will permit our passing over the consideration of the\r\n       little that is further known concerning it.\r\n\r\n  [27] Phosphorus (Chapter XIX.) gives the hydride PH_{3}, corresponding\r\n       with ammonia, NH_{3}, and forms phosphorous acid, PH_{3}O_{3},\r\n       which is analogous to nitrous acid, just as phosphoric acid is\r\n       to nitric acid; but phosphoric (or, better, orthophosphoric)\r\n       acid, PH_{3}O_{4}, is able to lose water and give pyro-and\r\n       meta-phosphoric acids. The latter is equal to the ortho-acid\r\n       minus water = PHO_{3}, and therefore nitric acid, NHO_{3},\r\n       is really meta-nitric acid. So also nitrous acid, HNO_{2},\r\n       is meta-nitrous (anhydrous) acid, and thus the ortho-acid is\r\n       NH_{3}O_{3} = N(OH)_{3}. Hence for nitric acid we should expect\r\n       to find, besides the ordinary or meta-nitric acid, HNO_{3}\r\n       (= 1/2N_{2}O_{3},H_{2}O), and ortho-nitric acid, H_{3}NO_{4}\r\n       (= 1/2N_{2}O_{3},3H_{2}O), an intermediate pyro-nitric acid,\r\n       N_{2}H_{4}O_{7}, corresponding to pyrophosphoric acid,\r\n       P_{2}H_{4}O_{7}. We shall see (for instance, in Chapter XVI.,\r\n       Note 21) that in nitric acid there is indeed an inclination\r\n       of the ordinary salts (of the meta-acid), MNO_{3}, to combine\r\n       with bases M_{2}O, and to approximate to the composition of\r\n       ortho-compounds which are equal to meta-compound and bases\r\n       (MNO_{3} + M_{2}O = M_{3}NO_{4}).\r\n\r\n1. It is easy to prove the possibility of the oxidation of ammonia into\r\nnitric acid by passing a mixture of ammonia and air over heated spongy\r\nplatinum. This causes the oxidation of the ammonia, nitric acid being\r\nformed, which partially combines with the excess of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe converse passage of nitric acid into ammonia is effected by the\r\naction of hydrogen at the moment of its evolution.[28] Thus metallic\r\naluminium, evolving hydrogen from a solution of caustic soda, is able to\r\ncompletely convert nitric acid added to the mixture (as a salt, because\r\nthe alkali gives a salt with the nitric acid) into ammonia, NHO_{3} + 8H\r\n= NH_{3} + 3H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n2. In 1890 Curtius in Germany obtained a gaseous substance of the\r\ncomposition HN_{3} (hydrogen trinitride), having the distinctive\r\nproperties of an acid, and giving, like hydrochloric acid, salts;\r\nfor example, a sodium salt, NaN_{3}; ammonium salt, NH_{4}N_{3} =\r\nN_{4}H_{4}; barium salt, Ba(N_{3})_{2}, &c., which he therefore named\r\nhydronitrous acid, _HN__{3}.[28 bis] The extraordinary composition\r\nof the compound (ammonia, NH_{3}, contains one N atom and three H\r\natoms; in HN_{3}, on the contrary, there are three N atoms and one H\r\natom), the facile decomposition of its salts with an explosion, and\r\nabove all its distinctly acid character (an aqueous solution shows a\r\nstrong acid reaction to litmus), not only indicated the importance of\r\nthis unexpected discovery, but at first gave rise to some perplexity\r\nas to the nature of the substance obtained, for the relations in\r\nwhich HN_{3} stood to other simple compounds of nitrogen which had\r\nlong been known was not at all evident, and the scientific spirit\r\nespecially requires that there should be a distinct bond between\r\nevery innovation, every fresh discovery, and that which is already\r\nfirmly established and known, for upon this basis is founded that\r\napparently paradoxical union in science of a conservative stability\r\nwith an irresistible and never-ceasing improvement. This missing,\r\nconnection between the newly discovered hydronitrous acid, HN_{3},\r\nand the long known ammonia, NH_{3}, and nitric acid, HNO_{3}, may\r\nbe found in the law of substitution, starting from the well-known\r\nproperties and composition of nitric acid and ammonia, as I mentioned\r\nin the 'Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society' (1890).\r\nThe essence of the matter lies in the fact that to the hydrate of\r\nammonium, or caustic ammonia, NH_{4}OH, there should correspond,\r\naccording to the law of substitution, an ortho-nitric acid (_see_\r\nNote 27), H_{3}NO_{4} = NO(OH)_{3}, which equals NH_{4}(OH) with\r\nthe substitution in it of (_a_) two atoms of hydrogen by oxygen\r\n(O--H_{2}) and (_b_) two atoms of hydrogen by the aqueous radicle\r\n(OH--H). Ordinary or meta-nitric acid is merely this ortho-nitric\r\nacid minus water. To ortho-nitric acid there should correspond the\r\nammoniacal salts: mono-substituted, H_{2}NH_{4}NO_{4}; bi-substituted,\r\nH(NH_{4})_{2}NO_{4}; and tri-substituted, (NH_{4})_{3}NO_{4}. These\r\nsalts, containing as they do hydrogen and oxygen, like many similar\r\nammoniacal salts (see, for instance, Chapter IX.--Cyanides), are able\r\nto part with them in the form of water. Then from the first salt we\r\nhave H_{2}NH_{4}NO_{4}-4H_{2}O = N_{2}O--nitrous oxide, and from the\r\nsecond H(NH_{4})_{2}NO4-4H_{2}O = HN_{3}--hydronitrous acid, and from\r\nthe third (NH_{4})_{3}NO-4H_{2}O = N_{4}H_{4}--the ammonium salt of the\r\nsame acid. The composition of HN_{3} should be thus understood, whilst\r\nits acid properties are explained by the fact that the water (4H_{2}O)\r\nfrom H(NH_{4})_{2}N_O{4} is formed at the expense of the hydrogen of the\r\nammonium and oxygen of the nitric acid, so that there remains the same\r\nhydrogen as in nitric acid, or that which may be replaced by metals and\r\ngive salts. Moreover, nitrogen undoubtedly belongs to that category of\r\nmetalloids which give acids, like chlorine and carbon, and therefore,\r\nunder the influence of three of its atoms, one atom of hydrogen acquires\r\nthose properties which it has in acids, just as in HCN (hydrocyanic\r\nacid) the hydrogen has received these properties under the influence of\r\nthe carbon and nitrogen (and HN_{3} may be regarded as HCN where C has\r\nbeen replaced by N_{2}). Moreover, besides explaining the composition\r\nand acid properties of HN_{3}, the above method gives the possibility\r\nof foretelling the closeness of the bond between hydronitrous acid and\r\nnitrous oxide, for N_{2}O + NH_{3} = HN_{3} + H_{2}O. This reaction,\r\nwhich was foreseen from the above considerations, was accomplished\r\nby Wislicenus (1892) by the synthesis of the sodium salt, by taking\r\nthe amide of sodium, NH_{2}Na (obtained by heating Na in a current of\r\nNH_{3}), and acting upon it (when heated) with nitrous oxide, N_{2}O,\r\nwhen 2NH_{2}Na + N_{2}O = NaN_{3} + NaHO + NH_{3}. The resultant salt,\r\nNaN_{3}, gives hydronitrous acid when acted upon by sulphuric acid,\r\nNaN_{3} + H_{2}SO_{4} = NaHSO_{4} +HN_{3}. The latter gives, with the\r\ncorresponding solutions of their salts, the insoluble (and easily\r\nexplosive) salts of silver, AgN_{3} (insoluble, like AgCl or AgCN), and\r\nlead, Pb(N_{3})_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [28] The formation of ammonia is observed in many cases of oxidation by\r\n       means of nitric acid. This substance is even formed in the action\r\n       of nitric acid on tin, especially if dilute acid be employed in\r\n       the cold. A still more considerable amount of ammonia is obtained\r\n       if, in the action of nitric acid, there are conditions directly\r\n       tending to the evolution of hydrogen, which then reduces the acid\r\n       to ammonia; for instance, in the action of zinc on a mixture of\r\n       nitric and sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\n  [28 bis] Curtius started with benzoylhydrazine, C_{6}H_{5}CONHNH_{2}\r\n       (hydrazine, see Note 20 bis). (This substance is obtained by\r\n       the action of hydrated hydrazine on the compound ether of benzoic\r\n       acid). Benzoylhydrazine under the action of nitrous acid gives\r\n       benzoylazoimide and water:\r\n\r\n         C_{6}H_{5}CONHNH_{2} + NO_{2}H = C_{6}H_{5}CON_{3} + 2H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n       Benzoylazoimide when treated with sodium alcoholate gives the\r\n       sodium salt of hydronitrous acid:\r\n\r\n         C_{6}H_{5}CON_{3} + C_{2}H_{3}ONa\r\n                                 = C_{6}H_{5}O_{2}C_{2}H_{3} + NaN_{3}.\r\n\r\n       The addition of ether to the resultant solution precipitates the\r\n       NaN_{3}, and this salt when treated with sulphuric acid gives\r\n       gaseous hydronitrous acid, HN_{3}. It has an acrid smell, and is\r\n       easily soluble in water. The aqueous solution exhibits a strongly\r\n       acid reaction. Metals dissolve in this solution and give the\r\n       corresponding salts. With hydronitrous acid gaseous ammonia forms\r\n       a white cloud, consisting of the salt of ammonium, NH_{4}N_{3}.\r\n       This salt separates out from an alcoholic solution in the form of\r\n       white lustrous scales. The salts of hydronitrous acid are obtained\r\n       by a reaction of substitution with the sodium or ammonium salts.\r\n       In this manner Curtius obtained and studied the salts of silver\r\n       (AgN_{3}), mercury (HgN_{3}), lead (PbN_{6}), barium (BaN_{6}).\r\n       With hydrazine, N_{2}H_{4}, hydronitrous acid forms saline\r\n       compounds in the composition of which there are one or two\r\n       particles of N_{3}H per one particle of hydrazine; thus N_{5}H_{5}\r\n       and N_{8}H_{6}. The first was obtained in an almost pure form. It\r\n       crystallises from an aqueous solution in dense, volatile, lustrous\r\n       prisms (up to 1 in. long), which fuse at 50°, and deliquesce in\r\n       the air; from a solution in boiling alcohol it separates out in\r\n       bright crystalline plates. This salt, N_{5}H_{5}, has the same\r\n       empirical composition, NH, as the ammonium salt of hydronitrous\r\n       acid, N_{4}H_{4}, and imide; but their molecules and structure are\r\n       different. Curtius also obtained (1893) hydronitrous acid by\r\n       passing the vapour of N_{2}O_{5} (evolved by the action of HNO_{3}\r\n       on As_{2}O_{3}) into a solution of hydrazine, N_{2}H_{4}.\r\n       Similarly Angeli, by acting upon a saturated solution of silver\r\n       nitrite with a strong solution of hydrazine, obtained the\r\n       explosive AgN_{3} in the form of a precipitate, and this reaction,\r\n       which is based upon the equation N_{2}H_{4} + NHO_{2} = HN_{3} +\r\n       2H_{2}O, proceeds so easily that it forms an experiment for the\r\n       lecture table. A thermal investigation of hydronitrous acid by\r\n       Berthelot and Matignon gave the following figures for the heat of\r\n       solution of the ammonium salt N_{3}HNH_{3} (1 grm. in 100 parts of\r\n       water)-708 C., and for the heat of neutralisation by barium\r\n       hydrate +10·0 C., and by ammonia +8·2 C. The heat of combustion of\r\n       N_{4}H_{4} (+163·8 C. at a constant vol.) gives the heat of\r\n       formation of the salt N_{4}H_{4} (solid) as -25·3 C. and\r\n       (solution)-32·3 C.; this explains the explosive nature of this\r\n       compound. In its heat of formation from the elements N_{3}H =-62·6\r\n       C., this compound differs from all the hydrogen compounds of\r\n       nitrogen in having a maximum absorption of heat, which explains\r\n       its instability.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of nitrogen with oxygen present an excellent example of\r\nthe law of multiple proportions, because they contain, for 14 parts by\r\nweight of nitrogen, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 parts respectively by weight\r\nof oxygen. The composition of these compounds is as follows:--\r\n\r\n             N_{2}O, nitrous oxide; hydrate NHO.\r\n             N_{2}O_{2}, nitric oxide, NO.\r\n             N_{2}O_{3}, nitrous anhydride; hydrate NHO_{2}.\r\n             N_{2}O_{4}, peroxide of nitrogen, NO_{2}.\r\n             N_{2}O_{5}, nitric anhydride; hydrate NHO_{3}.\r\n\r\nOf these compounds,[29] nitrous and nitric oxides, peroxide of\r\nnitrogen, and nitric acid, NHO_{3}, are characterised as being the most\r\nstable. _The lower oxides, when coming into contact with the higher,\r\nmay give the intermediate forms_; for instance, NO and NO_{2} form\r\nN_{2}O_{3}, _and the intermediate oxides may, in splitting up, give a\r\nhigher and lower oxide_. So N_{2}O_{4} gives N_{2}O_{3} and N_{2}O_{5},\r\nor, in the presence of water, their hydrates.\r\n\r\n  [29] According to the thermochemical determinations of Favre, Thomsen,\r\n       and more especially of Berthelot, it follows that, in the\r\n       formation of such quantities of the oxides of nitrogen as express\r\n       their formulæ, if gaseous nitrogen and oxygen be taken as the\r\n       starting points, and if the compounds formed be also gaseous, the\r\n       following amounts of heat, expressed in thousands of heat units,\r\n       are _absorbed_ (hence a minus sign):--\r\n\r\n         N_{2}O   N_{2}O_{2}    N_{2}O_{3}    N_{2}O_{4}    N_{2}O_{5}\r\n          -21        -43           -22           -5            -1\r\n              -22           +21           +17            +4\r\n\r\n       The difference is given in the lower line. For example, if\r\n       N_{2}, or 28 grams of nitrogen, combine with O--that is, with 16\r\n       grams of oxygen--then 21,000 units of heat are absorbed, that\r\n       is, sufficient heat to raise 21,000 grams of water through 1°.\r\n       Naturally, direct observations are impossible in this case; but\r\n       if charcoal, phosphorus, or similar substances are burnt both in\r\n       nitrous oxide and in oxygen, and the heat evolved is observed\r\n       in both cases, then the difference (more heat will be evolved\r\n       in burning in nitrous oxide) gives the figures required. If\r\n       N_{2}O_{2}, by combining with O_{2}, gives N_{2}O_{4}, then, as\r\n       is seen from the table, heat should be developed, namely, 38,000\r\n       units of heat, or NO + O = 19,000 units of heat. The differences\r\n       given in the table show that the maximum absorption of heat\r\n       corresponds with nitric oxide, and that the higher oxides are\r\n       formed from it with evolution of heat. If liquid nitric acid,\r\n       NHO_{3}, were decomposed into N + O_{3} + H, then 41,000 heat\r\n       units would be required; that is, an evolution of heat takes\r\n       place in its formation from the gases. It should be observed\r\n       that the formation of ammonia, NH_{3}, from the gases N + H_{3}\r\n       evolves 12·2 thousand heat units.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, under certain conditions, nitrogen combines\r\nwith oxygen, and we know that ammonia may he oxidised. In these cases\r\nvarious oxidation products of nitrogen are formed, but in the presence\r\nof water and an excess of oxygen they always give nitric acid. Nitric\r\nacid, as corresponding with the highest oxide, is able, in deoxidising,\r\nto give the lower oxides; it is the only nitrogen acid whose salts occur\r\nsomewhat widely in nature, and it has many technical uses, for which\r\nreason we will begin with it.\r\n\r\n_Nitric acid_, NHO_{3}, is likewise known as aqua fortis. In a free\r\nstate it is only met with in nature in small quantities, in the air\r\nand in rain-water after storms; but even in the atmosphere nitric\r\nacid does not long remain free, but combines with ammonia, traces of\r\nwhich are always found in air. On falling on the soil and into running\r\nwater, &c., the nitric acid everywhere comes into contact with bases\r\n(or their carbonates), which easily act on it, and therefore it is\r\nconverted into the nitrates of these bases. Hence nitric acid is always\r\nmet with in the form of salts in nature. The soluble salts of nitric\r\nacid are called _nitres_. This name is derived from the Latin _sal\r\nnitri_. The potassium salt, KNO_{3}, is common nitre, and the sodium\r\nsalt, NaNO_{3}, Chili saltpetre, or cubic nitre. Nitres are formed\r\nin the soil when a nitrogenous substance is slowly oxidised in the\r\npresence of an alkali by means of the oxygen of the atmosphere. In\r\nnature there are very frequent instances of such oxidation. For this\r\nreason certain soils and rubbish heaps--for instance, lime rubbish (in\r\nthe presence of a base)--lime contain a more or less considerable amount\r\nof nitre. One of these nitres--sodium nitrate--is extracted from the\r\nearth in large quantities in Chili, where it was probably formed by the\r\noxidation of animal refuse. This kind of nitre is employed in practice\r\nfor the manufacture of nitric acid and the other oxygen compounds of\r\nnitrogen. Nitric acid is obtained from _Chili saltpetre_ by heating it\r\nwith _sulphuric acid_. The hydrogen of the sulphuric acid replaces the\r\nsodium in the nitre. The sulphuric acid then forms either an acid salt,\r\nNaHSO_{4}, or a normal salt, Na_{2}SO_{4}, whilst nitric acid is formed\r\nfrom the nitre and is volatilised. The decomposition is expressed by\r\nthe equations: (1) NaNO_{3} + H_{2}SO_{4} = HNO_{3} + NaHSO_{4}, if the\r\nacid salt be formed, and (2) 2NaNO_{3} + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n+ 2HNO_{3}, if the normal sodium sulphate is formed. With an excess\r\nof sulphuric acid, at a moderate heat, and at the commencement of the\r\nreaction, the decomposition proceeds according to the first equation;\r\nand on further heating with a sufficient amount of nitre according to\r\nthe second, because the acid salt NaHSO_{4} itself acts like an acid\r\n(its hydrogen being replaceable as in acids), according to the equation\r\nNaNO_{3} + NaHSO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + HNO_{3}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Method of preparing nitric acid on a large\r\nscale. A cast-iron retort, C, is fixed into the furnace, and heated\r\nby the fire, B. The flame and products of combustion are at first led\r\nalong the flue, M (in order to heat the receivers), and afterwards into\r\nL. The retort is charged with Chili saltpetre and sulphuric acid, and\r\nthe cover is luted on with clay and gypsum. A clay tube, _a_, is fixed\r\ninto the neck of the retort (in order to prevent the nitric acid from\r\ncorroding the cast iron), and a bent glass tube, D, is luted on to it.\r\nThis tube carries the vapours into a series of earthenware receivers, E.\r\nNitric acid mixed with sulphuric acid collects in the first. The purest\r\nnitric acid is procured from the second, whilst that which condenses in\r\nthe third receiver contains hydrochloric acid, and that in the fourth\r\nnitrous oxide. Water is poured into the last receiver in order to\r\ncondense the residual vapours.]\r\n\r\nThe sulphuric acid, as it is said, here displaces the nitric acid from\r\nits compound with the base.[29 bis] Thus, in the reaction of sulphuric\r\nacid on nitre there is formed a non-volatile salt of sulphuric acid,\r\nwhich remains, together with an excess of this acid, in the distilling\r\napparatus, and nitric acid, which is converted into vapour, and may be\r\ncondensed, because it is a liquid and volatile substance. On a small\r\nscale, this reaction may be carried on in a glass retort with a glass\r\ncondenser. On a large scale, in chemical works, the process is exactly\r\nsimilar, only iron retorts are employed for holding the mixture of\r\nnitre and sulphuric acid, and earthenware three-necked bottles are used\r\ninstead of a condenser,[30] as shown in fig. 47.\r\n\r\n  [29 bis] This often gives rise to the supposition that sulphuric acid\r\n        possesses a considerable degree of affinity or energy compared\r\n       with nitric acid, but we shall afterwards see that the idea of the\r\n       relative degree of affinity of acids and bases is, in many cases,\r\n       exceedingly unbiassed; it need not be accepted so long as it is\r\n       possible to explain the observed phenomena without admitting any\r\n       supposition whatever of the degree of the force of affinity,\r\n       because the latter cannot be measured. The action of sulphuric\r\n       acid upon nitre may be explained by the fact alone that the\r\n       resultant nitric acid is volatile. The nitric acid is the only one\r\n       of all the substances partaking in the reaction which is able to\r\n       pass into vapour; it alone is volatile, while the remainder are\r\n       non-volatile, or, more strictly speaking, exceedingly difficultly\r\n       volatile substances. Let us imagine that the sulphuric acid is\r\n       only able to set free a small quantity of nitric acid from its\r\n       salt, and this will suffice to explain the decomposition of the\r\n       whole of the nitre by the sulphuric acid, because once the nitric\r\n       acid is separated it passes into vapour when heated, and passes\r\n       away from the sphere of action of the remaining substances; then\r\n       the free sulphuric acid will set free a fresh small quantity of\r\n       nitric acid, and so on until it drives off the entire quantity. It\r\n       is evident that, in this explanation, it is essential that the\r\n       sulphuric acid should be in excess (although not greatly)\r\n       throughout the reaction; according to the equation expressing the\r\n       reaction, 98 parts of sulphuric acid are required per 85 parts of\r\n       Chili nitre; but if this proportion be maintained in practice the\r\n       nitric acid is not all disengaged by the sulphuric acid; an excess\r\n       of the latter must be taken, and generally 80 parts of Chili nitre\r\n       are taken per 98 parts of acid, so that a portion of the sulphuric\r\n       acid remains free to the very end of the reaction.\r\n\r\n  [30] It must be observed that sulphuric acid, at least when undiluted\r\n       (60° Baumé), corrodes cast iron with difficulty, so that the\r\n       acid may be heated in cast-iron retorts. Nevertheless, both\r\n       sulphuric and nitric acids have a certain action on cast iron,\r\n       and therefore the acid obtained will contain traces of iron. In\r\n       practice sodium nitrate (Chili saltpetre) is usually employed\r\n       because it is cheaper, but in the laboratory it is best to take\r\n       potassium nitrate, because it is purer and does not froth up so\r\n       much as sodium nitrate when heated with sulphuric acid. In the\r\n       action of an excess of sulphuric acid on nitre and nitric acid\r\n       a portion of the latter is decomposed, forming lower oxides of\r\n       nitrogen, which are dissolved in the nitric acid. A portion\r\n       of the sulphuric acid itself is also carried over as spray by\r\n       the vapours of the nitric acid. Hence sulphuric acid occurs\r\n       as an impurity in commercial nitric acid. A certain amount of\r\n       hydrochloric acid will also be found to be present in it, because\r\n       sodium chloride is generally found as an impurity in nitre, and\r\n       under the action of sulphuric acid it forms hydrochloric acid.\r\n       Commercial acid further contains a considerable excess of water\r\n       above that necessary for the formation of the hydrate, because\r\n       water is first poured into the earthenware vessels employed for\r\n       condensing the nitric acid in order to facilitate its cooling and\r\n       condensation. Further, the acid of composition HNO_{3} decomposes\r\n       with great ease, with the evolution of oxides of nitrogen. Thus\r\n       the commercial acid contains a great number of impurities, and\r\n       is frequently purified in the following manner:--Lead nitrate is\r\n       first added to the acid because it forms non-volatile and almost\r\n       insoluble (precipitated) substances with the free sulphuric\r\n       and hydrochloric acids, and liberates nitric acid in so doing,\r\n       according to the equations Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + 2HCl = PbCl_{2} +\r\n       2NHO_{3} and Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = PbSO_{4} + 2NHO_{3}.\r\n       Potassium chromate is then added to the impure nitric acid,\r\n       by which means oxygen is liberated from the chromic acid, and\r\n       this oxygen, at the moment of its evolution, oxidises the lower\r\n       oxides of nitrogen and converts them into nitric acid. A pure\r\n       nitric acid, containing no impurities other than water, may be\r\n       then obtained by carefully distilling the acid, treated as above\r\n       described, and particularly if only the middle portions of the\r\n       distillate are collected. Such acid should give no precipitate,\r\n       either with a solution of barium chloride (a precipitate shows\r\n       the presence of sulphuric acid) or with a solution of silver\r\n       nitrate (a precipitate shows the presence of hydrochloric acid),\r\n       nor should it, after being diluted with water, give a coloration\r\n       with starch containing potassium iodide (a coloration shows the\r\n       admixture of other oxides of nitrogen). The oxides of nitrogen\r\n       may be most easily removed from impure nitric acid by heating\r\n       for a certain time with a small quantity of pure charcoal. By\r\n       the action of nitric acid on the charcoal carbonic anhydride\r\n       is evolved, which carries off the lower oxides of nitrogen. On\r\n       redistilling, pure acid is obtained. The oxides of nitrogen\r\n       occurring in solution may also be removed by passing air through\r\n       the nitric acid.\r\n\r\nNitric acid so obtained always contains water. It is extremely difficult\r\nto deprive it of all the admixed water without destroying a portion of\r\nthe acid itself and partially converting it into lower oxides, because\r\nwithout the presence of an excess of water it is very unstable. When\r\nrapidly distilled a portion is decomposed, and there are obtained free\r\noxygen and lower oxides of nitrogen, which, together with the water,\r\nremain in solution with the nitric acid. Therefore it is necessary to\r\nwork with great care in order to obtain a pure hydrate of nitric acid,\r\nHNO_{3}, and especially to mix the nitric acid obtained from nitre, as\r\nabove described, with sulphuric acid, which takes up the water, and\r\nto distil it at the lowest possible temperature--that is, by placing\r\nthe retort holding the mixture in a water or oil bath and carefully\r\nheating it. The first portion of the nitric acid thus distilled boils\r\nat 86°, has a specific gravity at 15° of 1·526, and solidifies at -50°;\r\nit is very unstable at higher temperatures. This is the normal hydrate,\r\nHNO_{3}, which corresponds with the salts, NMO_{3}, of nitric acid.\r\nWhen diluted with water nitric acid presents a higher boiling point,\r\nnot only as compared with that of the nitric acid itself, but also with\r\nthat of water; so that, if very dilute nitric acid be distilled, the\r\nfirst portions passing over will consist of almost pure water, until\r\nthe boiling point in the vapours reaches 121°. At this temperature a\r\ncompound of nitric acid with water, containing about 70 p.c. of nitric\r\nacid,[31] distils over; its specific gravity at 15° = 1·421. If the\r\nsolution contain less than 25 p.c. of water, then, the specific gravity\r\nof the solution being above 1·44, HNO_{3} evaporates off and fumes in\r\nthe air, forming the above hydrate, whose vapour tension is less than\r\nthat of water. Such solutions form _fuming nitric acid_. On distilling\r\nit gives monohydrated acid,[32] HNO_{3}; it is a hydrate boiling at\r\n121°, so that it is obtained from both weak and strong solutions. Fuming\r\nnitric acid, under the action not only of organic substances, but\r\neven of heat, loses a portion of its oxygen, forming lower oxides of\r\nnitrogen, which impart a _red-brown colour_ to it;[33] the pure acid is\r\ncolourless.\r\n\r\n  [31] Dalton, Smith, Bineau, and others considered that the hydrate of\r\n       constant boiling point (see Chapter I., Note 60) for nitric\r\n       acid was the compound 2HNO_{3},3H_{2}O, but Roscoe showed that\r\n       its composition changes with a variation of the pressure and\r\n       temperature under which the distillation proceeds. Thus, at\r\n       a pressure of 1 atmosphere the solution of constant boiling\r\n       point contains 68·6 p.c., and at one-tenth of an atmosphere\r\n       66·8 p.c. Judging from what has been said concerning solutions\r\n       of hydrochloric acid, and from the variation of specific\r\n       gravity, I think that the comparatively large decrease in the\r\n       tensions of the vapours depends on the formation of a hydrate,\r\n       NHO_{3},2H_{2}O (= 63·6 p.c.). Such a hydrate may be expressed by\r\n       N(HO)_{5}, that is, as NH_{4}(HO), in which all the equivalents\r\n       of hydrogen are replaced by hydroxyl. The constant boiling point\r\n       will then be the temperature of the decomposition of this hydrate.\r\n\r\n       The variation of the specific gravity at 15° from water (_p_\r\n       = 0) to the hydrate NHO_{3},5H_{2}O (41·2 p.c. HNO_{3}) is\r\n       expressed by _s_ = 9992 + 57·4_p_ + 0·16_p^2_, if water = 10,000\r\n       at 4°. For example, when _p_ = 30 p.c., _s_ = 11,860. For more\r\n       concentrated solutions, at least, the above-mentioned hydrate,\r\n       HNO_{3},2H_{2}O, must be taken, up to which the specific gravity\r\n       _s_ = 9570 + 84·18_p_-0·240_p_^2; but perhaps (since the results\r\n       of observations of the specific gravity of the solutions are not\r\n       in sufficient agreement to arrive at a conclusion) the hydrate\r\n       HNO_{3},3H_{2}O should be recognised, as is indicated by many\r\n       nitrates (Al, Mg, Co, &c.), which crystallise with this amount\r\n       of water of crystallisation. From HNO_{3},2H_{2}O to HNO_{3}\r\n       the specific gravity of the solutions (at 15°) _s_ = 10,652 +\r\n       62·08_p_-0·160_p_^2. The hydrate HNO_{3},2H_{2}O is recognised by\r\n       Berthelot on the basis of the thermochemical data for solutions\r\n       of nitric acid, because on approaching to this composition there\r\n       is a rapid change in the amount of heat evolved by mixing nitric\r\n       acid with water. Pickering (1892) by refrigeration obtained\r\n       the crystalline hydrates: HNO_{3},H_{2}O, melting at -37° and\r\n       HNO_{3},3H_{2}O, melting at -18°. A more detailed study of the\r\n       reactions of hydrated nitric acid would no doubt show the\r\n       existence of change in the process and rapidity of reaction in\r\n       approaching these hydrates.\r\n\r\n  [32] The normal hydrate HNO_{3}, corresponding with the ordinary salts,\r\n       may be termed the monohydrated acid, because the anhydride\r\n       N_{2}O_{5} with water forms this normal nitric acid. In this\r\n       sense the hydrate HNO_{3},2H_{2}O is the pentahydrated acid.\r\n\r\n  [33] For technical and laboratory purposes recourse is frequently had\r\n       to _red fuming nitric acid_--that is, the normal nitric acid,\r\n       HNO_{3}, containing lower oxides of nitrogen in solution. This\r\n       acid is prepared by decomposing nitre with half its weight\r\n       of strong sulphuric acid, or by distilling nitric acid with\r\n       an excess of sulphuric acid. The normal nitric acid is first\r\n       obtained, but it partially decomposes, and gives the lower\r\n       oxidation products of nitrogen, which are dissolved by the nitric\r\n       acid, to which they impart its usual pale-brown or reddish\r\n       colour. This acid fumes in the air, from which it attracts\r\n       moisture, forming a less volatile hydrate. If carbonic anhydride\r\n       be passed through the red-brown fuming nitric acid for a long\r\n       period of time, especially if, assisted by a moderate heat, it\r\n       expels all the lower oxides, and leaves a colourless acid free\r\n       from these oxides. It is necessary, in the preparation of the red\r\n       acid, that the receivers should be kept quite cool, because it\r\n       is only when cold that nitric acid is able to dissolve a large\r\n       proportion of the oxides of nitrogen. The strong red fuming acid\r\n       has a specific gravity 1·56 at 20°, and has a suffocating smell\r\n       of the oxides of nitrogen. When the red acid is mixed with water\r\n       it turns green, and then of a bluish colour, and with an excess\r\n       of water ultimately becomes colourless. This is owing to the fact\r\n       that the oxides of nitrogen in the presence of water and nitric\r\n       acid are changed, and give coloured solutions.\r\n\r\n       Markleffsky (1892) showed that the green solutions contain\r\n       (besides HNO_{3}) HNO_{2} and N_{2}O_{4}, whilst the blue\r\n       solutions only contain HNO_{2} (_see_ Note 48).\r\n\r\n       The action of red fuming nitric acid (or a mixture with sulphuric\r\n       acid) is in many cases very powerful and rapid, and it sometimes\r\n       acts differently from pure nitric acid. Thus iron becomes\r\n       covered with a coating of oxides, and insoluble in acids; it\r\n       becomes, as is said, passive. Thus chromic acid (and potassium\r\n       dichromate) gives oxide of chromium in this red acid--that is, it\r\n       is deoxidised. This is owing to the presence of the lower oxides\r\n       of nitrogen, which are capable of being oxidised--that is, of\r\n       passing into nitric acid like the higher oxides. But, generally,\r\n       the action of fuming nitric acid, both red and colourless, is\r\n       powerfully oxidising.\r\n\r\nNitric acid, as an _acid hydrate_, enters into reactions of double\r\ndecomposition with bases, basic hydrates (alkalis), and with salts.\r\nIn all these cases a salt of nitric acid is obtained. An alkali and\r\nnitric acid give water and a salt; so, also, a basic oxide with nitric\r\nacid gives a salt and water; for instance, lime, CaO + 2HNO_{3} =\r\nCa(NO_{3})_{2} + H_{2}O. Many of these salts are termed nitres.[34]\r\nThe composition of the ordinary salts of nitric acid may be expressed\r\nby the general formula M(NO_{3})_{_n_}, where M indicates a metal\r\nreplacing the hydrogen in one or several (_n_) equivalents of nitric\r\nacid. We shall find afterwards that the atoms M of metals are equivalent\r\nto one (K, Na, Ag) atom of hydrogen, or two (Ca, Mg, Ba), or three\r\n(Al, In), or, in general, _n_ atoms of hydrogen. _The salts of nitric\r\nacid_ are especially characterised by being all _soluble in water_.[35]\r\nFrom the property common to all these salts of entering into double\r\ndecompositions, and owing to the volatility of nitric acid, they evolve\r\nnitric acid when heated with sulphuric acid. They all, like the acid\r\nitself, are capable of evolving oxygen when heated, and consequently of\r\nacting as oxidising substances; they therefore, for instance, deflagrate\r\nwith ignited carbon, the carbon burning at the expense of the oxygen of\r\nthe salt and forming gaseous products of combustion.[36]\r\n\r\n  [34] Hydrogen is not evolved in the action of nitric acid (especially\r\n       strong) on metals, even with those metals which evolve hydrogen\r\n       under the action of other acids. This is because the hydrogen\r\n       at the moment of its separation reduces the nitric acid, with\r\n       formation of the lower oxides of nitrogen, as we shall afterwards\r\n       see.\r\n\r\n  [35] Certain basic salts of nitric acid, however (for example, the\r\n       basic salt of bismuth), are insoluble in water; whilst, on the\r\n       other hand, all the normal salts are soluble, and this forms an\r\n       exceptional phenomenon among acids, because all the ordinary\r\n       acids form insoluble salts with one or another base. Thus, for\r\n       sulphuric acid the salts of barium, lead, &c., for hydrochloric\r\n       acid the salts of silver, &c., are insoluble in water. However,\r\n       the normal salts of acetic and certain other acids are all\r\n       soluble.\r\n\r\n  [36] _Ammonium nitrate_, NH_{4}NO_{3}, is easily obtained by adding a\r\n       solution of ammonia or of ammonium carbonate to nitric acid until\r\n       it becomes neutral. On evaporating this solution, crystals of\r\n       the salt are formed which contain no water of crystallisation.\r\n       It crystallises in prisms like those formed by common nitre, and\r\n       has a refreshing taste; 100 parts of water at _t_° dissolve 54 +\r\n       0·61_t_ parts by weight of the salt. It is soluble in alcohol,\r\n       melts at 160°, and is decomposed at about 180°, forming water\r\n       and nitrous oxide, NH_{4}NO_{3} = 2H_{2}O + N_{2}O. If ammonium\r\n       nitrate be mixed with sulphuric acid, and the mixture be heated\r\n       to about the boiling point of water, then nitric acid is evolved,\r\n       and ammonium hydrogen sulphate remains in solution; but if the\r\n       mixture be heated rapidly to 16O°, then nitrous oxide is evolved.\r\n       In the first case the sulphuric acid takes up ammonia, and in the\r\n       second place water. Ammonium nitrate is employed in practice for\r\n       the artificial production of cold, because in dissolving in water\r\n       it lowers the temperature very considerably. For this purpose it\r\n       is best to take equal parts by weight of the salt and water. The\r\n       salt must first be reduced to a powder and then rapidly stirred\r\n       up in the water, when the temperature will fall from +15° to -10°,\r\n       so that the water freezes.\r\n\r\n       Ammonium nitrate absorbs ammonia, with which it forms\r\n       unstable compounds resembling compounds containing water\r\n       of crystallisation. (Divers 1872, Raoult 1873.) At -10°\r\n       NH_{4}NO_{3},2NH_{3} is formed: it is a liquid of sp. gr. 1·15,\r\n       which loses all its ammonia under the influence of heat. At +28°\r\n       NH_{4}NO_{3},NH_{3} is formed: it is a solid which easily parts\r\n       with its ammonia when heated, especially in solution.\r\n\r\n       Troost (1882) investigated the tension of the dissociation of\r\n       the compounds formed, and came to the conclusion that a definite\r\n       compound corresponding to the formula 2NH_{4}NO_{3},3NH_{3} is\r\n       formed, because the tension of dissociation remains constant\r\n       in the decomposition of such a compound at 0°. Y. Kouriloff\r\n       (1893), however, considers that the constancy of the tension of\r\n       the ammonia evolved is due to the decomposition of a saturated\r\n       solution, and not of a definite compound. During decomposition\r\n       the system is composed of a liquid and a solid; the tension\r\n       only becomes constant from the moment the solid falls down. The\r\n       composition 2NH_{4}NO_{3},3NH_{3} corresponds to a saturated\r\n       solution at 0°, and the solubility of NH_{4}NO_{3} in NH_{3}\r\n       increases with a rise of temperature.\r\n\r\nNitric acid also enters into double decompositions with a number of\r\nhydrocarbons not in any way possessing alkaline characters and not\r\nreacting with other acids. Under these circumstances the nitric acid\r\ngives water and a new substance termed a _nitro-compound_. The chemical\r\ncharacter of the nitro-compound is the same as that of the original\r\nsubstance; for example, if an indifferent substance be taken, then the\r\nnitro compound obtained from it will also be indifferent; if an acid\r\nbe taken, then an acid is obtained also.[36 bis] Benzene, C_{6}H_{6},\r\nfor instance, acts according to the equation C_{6}H_{6} + HNO_{3} =\r\nH_{2}O + C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}. Nitrobenzene is produced. The substance\r\ntaken, C_{6}H_{6}, is a liquid hydrocarbon having a faint tarry smell,\r\nboiling at 80°, and lighter than water; by the action of nitric acid\r\nnitrobenzene is obtained, which is a substance boiling at about 210°,\r\nheavier than water, and having an almond-like odour: it is employed in\r\nlarge quantities for the preparation of aniline and aniline dyes.[37]\r\nAs the nitro-compounds contain both combustible elements (hydrogen\r\nand carbon), as well as oxygen in unstable combination with nitrogen,\r\nin the form of the radicle NO_{2} of nitric acid, they decompose\r\nwith an explosion when ignited or even struck, owing to the pressure\r\nof the vapours and gases formed--free nitrogen, carbonic anhydride,\r\nCO_{2}, carbonic oxide, CO, and aqueous vapour. In the explosion of\r\nnitro compounds[37 bis] much heat is evolved, as in the combustion of\r\ngunpowder or detonating gas, and in this case the force of explosion in\r\na closed space is great, because from a solid or liquid nitro-compound\r\noccupying a small space there proceed vapours and gases whose elasticity\r\nis great not only from the small space in which they are formed, but\r\nowing to the high temperature corresponding to the combustion of the\r\nnitro-compound.[38]\r\n\r\n  [36 bis] This is explained by saying that in true nitro-compounds\r\n       the residue of nitric acid NO_{2} takes the place of the hydrogen\r\n       in the hydrocarbon group. For example, if C_{6}H_{5}OH be given,\r\n       then C_{6}H_{4}(NO_{2})OH will be a true nitro-compound having the\r\n       radical properties of C_{6}H_{5}OH. If, on the other hand, the\r\n       NO_{2} replace the hydrogen of the aqueous radicle\r\n       (C_{6}H_{5}ONO_{2}), then the chemical character varies, as in the\r\n       passage of KOH into KONO_{2} (nitre) (_see_ Note 37 and Organic\r\n       Chemistry).\r\n\r\n  [37] The compound ethers of nitric acid in which the hydrogen of the\r\n       aqueous radicle (OH) is replaced by the residue of nitric acid\r\n       (NO_{2}) are frequently called nitro-compounds. But in their\r\n       chemical character they differ from true nitro-compounds (for\r\n       details _see_ Organic Chemistry) and do not burn like them.\r\n\r\n       The action of nitric acid on cellulose, C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, is an\r\n       example. This substance, which forms the outer coating of all\r\n       plant cells, occurs in an almost pure state in cotton, in common\r\n       writing-paper, and in flax, &c.; under the action of nitric\r\n       acid it forms water and nitrocellulose (like water and KNO_{3}\r\n       from KHO), which, although it has the same appearance as the\r\n       cotton originally taken, differs from it entirely in properties.\r\n       It explodes when struck, bursts into flame very easily under\r\n       the action of sparks, and acts like gunpowder, whence its name\r\n       of pyroxylin, or gun-cotton. The composition of gun-cotton is\r\n       C_{6}H_{7}N_{3}O_{11} = C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} + 3NHO_{3}-3H_{2}O.\r\n       The proportion of the group NO_{2} in nitrocellulose may be\r\n       decreased by limiting the action of the nitric acid and compounds\r\n       obtained with different properties; for instance, the (impure)\r\n       well-known _collodion cotton_, containing from 11 to 12 per\r\n       cent. of nitrogen, and _pyro-collodion_ (Mendeléeff, 1890),\r\n       containing 12·4 per cent. of nitrogen. Both these products are\r\n       soluble in a mixture of alcohol and ether (in collodion a portion\r\n       of the substance is soluble in alcohol), and the solution when\r\n       evaporated gives a transparent film, which is insoluble in water.\r\n       A solution of collodion is employed in medicine for covering\r\n       wounds, and in wet-plate photography for giving on glass an even\r\n       coating of a substance into which the various reagents employed\r\n       in the process are introduced. Extremely fine threads (obtained\r\n       by forcing a gelatinous mixture of collodion, ether, and alcohol\r\n       through capillary tubes in water) of collodion form artificial\r\n       silk.\r\n\r\n  [37 bis] The property possessed by nitroglycerin (occurring in\r\n       dynamite), nitrocellulose, and the other nitro-compounds, of\r\n       burning with an explosion, and their employment for smokeless\r\n       powder and as explosives in general, depends on the reasons in\r\n       virtue of which a mixture of nitre and charcoal deflagrates and\r\n       explodes; in both cases the elements of the nitric acid occurring\r\n       in the compound are decomposed, the oxygen in burning unites with\r\n       the carbon, and the nitrogen is set free; thus a very large volume\r\n       of gaseous substances (nitrogen and oxides of carbon) is rapidly\r\n       formed from the solid substances originally taken. These gases\r\n       occupy an incomparably larger volume than the original substance,\r\n       and therefore produce a powerful pressure and explosion. It is\r\n       evident that in exploding with the development of heat (that is,\r\n       in decomposing, not with the absorption of energy, as is generally\r\n       the case, but with the evolution of energy) the nitro-compounds\r\n       form stores of energy which are easily set free, and that\r\n       consequently their elements occur in a state of particularly\r\n       energetic motion, which is especially strong in the group NO_{2}:\r\n       this group is common to all nitro-compounds, and all the oxygen\r\n       compounds of nitrogen are unstable, easily decomposable, and (Note\r\n       29) absorb heat in their formation. On the other hand, the\r\n       nitro-compounds are instructive as an example and proof of the\r\n       fact that the elements and groups forming compounds are united in\r\n       definite order in the molecules of a compound. A blow, concussion,\r\n       or rise of temperature is necessary to bring the combustible\r\n       elements C and H into the most intimate contact with NO_{2}, and\r\n       to distribute the elements in a new order in new compounds.\r\n\r\n       As regards the composition of the nitro-compounds, it will be seen\r\n       that the hydrogen of a given substance is replaced by the complex\r\n       group NO_{2} of the nitric acid. The same is observed in the\r\n       passage of alkalis into nitrates, so that the reactions of\r\n       substitution of nitric acid--that is, the formation of salts and\r\n       nitro-compounds--may be expressed in the following manner. In\r\n       these cases the hydrogen is replaced by the so-called _radicle of\r\n       nitric acid_ NO_{2}, as is evident from the following table:--\r\n\r\n                {Caustic potash   KHO.\r\n                {Nitre            K(NO_{2})O.\r\n\r\n                {Hydrate of lime  CaH_{2}O_{2}.\r\n                {Calcium nitrate  Ca(NO_{2})_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\n                {Glycerin         C_{3}H_{5}H_{3}O_{3}.\r\n                {Nitroglycerin    C_{3}H_{5}(NO_{2})_{3}O_{3}.\r\n\r\n                {Phenol           C_{6}H_{5}OH.\r\n                {Picric acid      C_{6}H_{2}(NO_{2})_{3}OH, &c.\r\n\r\n       The difference between the salts formed by nitric acid and the\r\n       nitro-compounds consists in the fact that nitric acid is very\r\n       easily separated from the salts of nitric acid by means of\r\n       sulphuric acid (that is, by a method of double saline\r\n       decomposition), whilst nitric acid is not displaced by sulphuric\r\n       acid from true nitro-compounds; for instance, nitrobenzene,\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}·NO_{2}. As nitro-compounds are formed exclusively from\r\n       hydrocarbons, they are described with them in organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n       The group NO_{2} of nitro-compounds in many cases (like all the\r\n       oxidised compounds of nitrogen) passes into the ammonia group or\r\n       into the ammonia radicle NH_{2}. This requires the action of\r\n       reducing substances evolving hydrogen: RNO_{2} + 6H = RNH_{3} +\r\n       2H_{2}O. Thus Zinin converted nitrobenzene, C_{6}H_{5}·NO_{2},\r\n       into aniline, C_{6}H_{5}·NH_{2}, by the action of hydrogen\r\n       sulphide.\r\n\r\n       Admitting the existence of the group NO_{2}, as replacing hydrogen\r\n       in various compounds, then nitric acid may be considered as water\r\n       in which half the hydrogen is replaced by the radical of nitric\r\n       acid. In this sense nitric acid is nitro-water, NO_{2}OH, and its\r\n       anhydride dinitro-water, (NO_{2})_{2}O. In nitric acid the radical\r\n       of nitric acid is combined with hydroxyl, just as in nitrobenzene\r\n       it is combined with the radical of benzene.\r\n\r\n       It should here be remarked that the group NO_{3} may be recognised\r\n       in the salts of nitric acid, because the salts have the\r\n       composition M(NO_{3})_{n}, just as the metallic chlorides have the\r\n       composition MCl_{n}. But the group NO_{3} does not form any other\r\n       compounds beyond the salts, and therefore it should he considered\r\n       as hydroxyl, HO, in which H is replaced by NO_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [38] The nitro-compounds play a very important part in mining and\r\n       artillery. Detailed accounts of them must be looked for in\r\n       special works, among which the works of A. R. Shuliachenke\r\n       and T. M. Chelletsoff occupy an important place in the\r\n       Russian literature on this subject, although historically the\r\n       scientific works of Abel in England and Berthelot in France\r\n       stand pre-eminent. The latter elucidated much in connection\r\n       with explosive compounds by a series of both experimental and\r\n       theoretical researches. Among explosives a particularly important\r\n       place from a practical point of view is occupied by ordinary or\r\n       black gunpowder (Chapter XIII., Note 16), fulminating mercury\r\n       (Chapter XVI., Note 26), the different forms of gun-cotton\r\n       (Chapter VI., Note 37), and nitro-glycerine (Chapter VIII.,\r\n       Note 45, and Chapter XII., Note 33). The latter when mixed\r\n       with solid pulverulent substances, like magnesia, tripoli,\r\n       &c., forms dynamite, which is so largely used in quarries and\r\n       mines in driving tunnels, &c. We may add that the simplest true\r\n       nitro-compound, or marsh gas, CH_{4}, in which all the hydrogens\r\n       are replaced by NO_{2} groups has been obtained by L. N.\r\n       Shishkoff, C(NO_{2})_{4}, as well as nitroform, CH(NO_{2})_{3}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--The method of decomposition of nitrous\r\nanhydride, also applicable to the other oxides of nitrogen, and to\r\ntheir analysis. NO_{2} is generated from nitrate of lead in the retort\r\nA. Nitric acid and other less volatile products are condensed in B.\r\nThe tube C C contains copper, and is heated from below. Undecomposed\r\nvolatile products (if any are formed) are condensed in D, which is\r\ncooled. If the decomposition be incomplete, brown fumes make their\r\nappearance in this receiver. The gaseous nitrogen is collected in the\r\ncylinder E.]\r\n\r\nIf the vapour of nitric acid is passed through an even moderately\r\nheated glass tube, the formation of dark-brown fumes of the lower\r\noxides of nitrogen and the separation of free oxygen may be observed,\r\n2NHO_{3} = H_{2}O + 2NO_{2} + O. The decomposition is complete at a\r\nwhite heat--that is, nitrogen is formed, 2NHO_{3} = H_{2}O + N_{2} +\r\nO_{5}. Hence it is easily understood that nitric acid may part with its\r\noxygen to a number of substances capable of being oxidised.[39] It is\r\nconsequently an _oxidising agent_. Charcoal, as we have already seen,\r\nburns in nitric acid; phosphorus, sulphur, iodine, and the majority of\r\nmetals also decompose nitric acid, some on heating and others even at\r\nthe ordinary temperature: the substances taken are oxidised and the\r\nnitric acid is deoxidised, yielding compounds containing less oxygen.\r\nOnly a few metals, such as gold and platinum, do not act on nitric acid,\r\nbut the majority decompose it; in so doing, an oxide of the metal is\r\nformed, which, if it has the character of a base, acts on the remaining\r\nnitric acid; hence, with the majority of metals the result of the\r\nreaction is usually not an oxide of the metal, but the corresponding\r\nsalt of nitric acid, and, at the same time, one of the lower oxides of\r\nnitrogen. The resulting salts of the metals are soluble, and hence it\r\nis said that nitric acid _dissolves_ nearly all metals.[40] This case\r\nis termed the solution of metals by acids, although it is not a case\r\nof simple solution, but a complex chemical change of the substances\r\ntaken. When treated with this acid, those metals whose oxides do not\r\ncombine with nitric acid yield the oxide itself, and not a salt; for\r\nexample, tin acts in this manner on nitric acid, forming a hydrated\r\noxide, SnH_{2}O_{3}, which is obtained in the form of a white powder,\r\nSn + 4NHO_{3} = H_{2}SnO_{3} + 4NO_{2} + H_{2}O. Silver is able to\r\ntake up still more oxygen, and to convert a large portion of nitric\r\nacid into nitrous anhydride, 4Ag + 6HNO_{3} = 4AgNO_{3} + N_{2}O_{3} +\r\n3H_{2}O. Copper takes up still more oxygen from nitric acid, converting\r\nit into nitric oxide, and, by the action of zinc, nitric acid is able\r\nto give up a still further quantity of nitrogen, forming nitrous oxide,\r\n4Zn + 10NHO_{3} = 4Zn(NO_{3})_{2} + N_{2}O + 5H_{2}O.[41] Sometimes,\r\nand especially with dilute solutions of nitric acid, the deoxidation\r\nproceeds as far as the formation of hydroxylamine and ammonia, and\r\nsometimes it leads to the formation of nitrogen itself. The formation of\r\none or other nitrogenous substance from nitric acid is determined, not\r\nonly by the nature of the reacting substances, but also by the relative\r\nmass of water and nitric acid, and also by the temperature and pressure,\r\nor the sum total of the conditions of reaction; and as in a given\r\nmixture even these conditions vary (the temperature and the relative\r\nmass vary), it not unfrequently happens that a mixture of different\r\nproducts of the deoxidation of nitric acid is formed.\r\n\r\n  [39] [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Decomposition of nitrous oxide by\r\n       sodium.]\r\n\r\n       Nitric acid may be entirely decomposed by passing its vapour\r\n       over highly incandescent copper, because the oxides of nitrogen\r\n       first formed give up their oxygen to the red-hot metallic copper,\r\n       so that water and nitrogen gas alone are obtained. This forms a\r\n       means for determining the composition both of nitric acid and\r\n       of all the other compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, because\r\n       by collecting the gaseous nitrogen formed it is possible to\r\n       calculate, from its volume, its weight and consequently its\r\n       amount in a given quantity of a nitrogenous substance, and by\r\n       weighing the copper before and after the decomposition it is\r\n       possible to determine the amount of oxygen by the increase\r\n       in weight. The complete decomposition of nitric acid is also\r\n       accomplished by passing a mixture of hydrogen and nitric acid\r\n       vapours through a red-hot tube. Sodium also decomposes the oxides\r\n       of nitrogen at a red-heat, taking up all the oxygen. This method\r\n       is sometimes used for determining the composition of the oxides\r\n       of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  [40] The application of this acid for etching copper or steel in\r\n       engraving is based on this fact. The copper is covered with a\r\n       coating of wax, resin, &c. (etching ground), on which nitric acid\r\n       does not act, and then the ground is removed in certain parts\r\n       with a needle, and the whole is washed in nitric acid. The parts\r\n       coated remain untouched, whilst the uncovered portions are eaten\r\n       into by the acid. Copper plates for etchings, aquatints, &c., are\r\n       prepared in this manner.\r\n\r\n  [41] The formation of such complex equations as the above often\r\n       presents some difficulty to the beginner. It should be observed\r\n       that if the reacting and resultant substances be known, it is\r\n       easy to form an equation for the reaction. Thus, if we wish\r\n       to form an equation expressing the reaction that nitric acid\r\n       acting on zinc gives nitrous oxide, N_{2}O, and zinc nitrate,\r\n       Zn(NO_{3})_{2}, we must reason as follows:--Nitric acid contains\r\n       hydrogen, whilst the salt and nitrous oxide do not; hence water\r\n       is formed, and therefore it is as though anhydrous nitric acid,\r\n       N_{2}O_{5}, were acting. For its conversion into nitrous oxide\r\n       it parts with four equivalents of oxygen, and hence it is able\r\n       to oxidise four equivalents of zinc and to convert it into zinc\r\n       oxide, ZnO. These four equivalents of zinc oxide require for\r\n       their conversion into the salt four more equivalents of nitric\r\n       anhydride; consequently five equivalents in all of the latter\r\n       are required, or ten equivalents of nitric acid. Thus ten\r\n       equivalents of nitric acid are necessary for four equivalents\r\n       of zinc in order to express the reaction in whole equivalents.\r\n       It must not be forgotten, however, that there are very few such\r\n       reactions which can be entirely expressed by simple equations.\r\n       The majority of equations of reactions only express the chief\r\n       and ultimate products of reaction, and thus none of the three\r\n       preceding equations express all that in reality occurs in the\r\n       action of metals on nitric acid. In no one of them is only\r\n       one oxide of nitrogen formed, but always several together or\r\n       consecutively--one after the other, according to the temperature\r\n       and strength of the acid. And this is easily intelligible. The\r\n       resulting oxide is itself capable of acting on metals and of\r\n       being deoxidised, and in the presence of the nitric acid it may\r\n       change the acid and be itself changed. The equations given must\r\n       be looked on as a systematic expression of the main features of\r\n       reactions, or as a limit towards which they tend, but to which\r\n       they only attain in the absence of disturbing influences.\r\n\r\nThus the action of nitric acid on metals consists in their being\r\noxidised, whilst the acid itself is converted, according to the\r\ntemperature, concentration in which it is taken, and the nature of the\r\nmetal, &c., into lower oxides, ammonia, or even into nitrogen.[42] Many\r\ncompounds are oxidised by nitric acid like metals and other elements;\r\nfor instance, lower oxides are converted into higher oxides. Thus,\r\narsenious acid is converted into arsenic acid, suboxide of iron into\r\noxide, sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid, the sulphides of the metals,\r\nM_{2}S, into sulphates, M_{2}SO_{4}, &c.; in a word, nitric acid brings\r\nabout oxidation, its oxygen is taken up and transferred to many other\r\nsubstances. Certain substances are oxidised by strong nitric acid so\r\nrapidly and with so great an evolution of heat that they deflagrate\r\nand burst into flame. Thus turpentine, C_{10}H_{16}, bursts into\r\nflame when poured into fuming nitric acid. In virtue of its oxidising\r\nproperty, nitric acid _removes the hydrogen_ from many substances. Thus\r\nit decomposes hydriodic acid, separating the iodine and forming water;\r\nand if fuming nitric acid be poured into a flask containing gaseous\r\nhydriodic acid, then a rapid reaction takes place, accompanied by flame\r\nand the separation of violet vapours of iodine and brown fumes of oxides\r\nof nitrogen.[43]\r\n\r\n  [42] Montemartini endeavours to show that the products evolved in the\r\n       action of nitric acid upon metals (and their amount) is in direct\r\n       connection with both the concentration of the acid and the\r\n       capacity of the metals to decompose water. Those metals which\r\n       only decompose water at a high temperature give, under the action\r\n       of nitric acid, NO_{2}, N_{2}O_{4}, and NO; whilst those metals\r\n       which decompose water at a lower temperature give, besides the\r\n       above products, N_{2}O, N, and NH_{3}; and, lastly, the metals\r\n       which decompose water at the ordinary temperature also evolve\r\n       hydrogen. It is observed that concentrated nitric acid oxidises\r\n       many metals with much greater difficulty than when diluted\r\n       with water; iron, copper, and tin are very easily oxidised by\r\n       dilute nitric acid, but remain unaltered under the influence of\r\n       monohydrated nitric acid or of the pure hydrate NHO_{3}. Nitric\r\n       acid diluted with a large quantity of water does not oxidise\r\n       copper, but it oxidises tin; dilute nitric acid also does not\r\n       oxidise either silver or mercury; but, on the addition of nitrous\r\n       acid, even dilute acid acts on the above metals. This naturally\r\n       depends on the smaller stability of nitrous acid, and on the fact\r\n       that after the commencement of the action the nitric acid is\r\n       itself converted into nitrous acid, which continues to act on the\r\n       silver and mercury. Veley (Oxford 1891) made detailed researches\r\n       on the action of nitric acid upon Cu, Hg, and Bi, and showed that\r\n       nitric acid of 30 p.c. strength does not act upon these metals at\r\n       the ordinary temperature if nitrous acid (traces are destroyed by\r\n       urea) and oxidising agents such as H_{2}O_{2}, KClO_{3}, &c. be\r\n       entirely absent; but in the presence of even a small amount of\r\n       nitrous acid the metals form nitrites, which, with HNO_{3}, form\r\n       nitrates and the oxides of nitrogen, which re-form the nitrous\r\n       acid necessary for starting the reaction, because the reaction\r\n       2NO + HNO_{3} + H_{2}O = 3HNO_{2} is reversible. The above metals\r\n       are quickly dissolved in a 1 p.c. solution of nitrous acid.\r\n       Moreover, Veley observed that nitric acid is partially converted\r\n       into nitrous acid by gaseous hydrogen in the presence of the\r\n       nitrates of Cu and Pb.\r\n\r\n  [43] When nitric acid acts on many organic substances it often happens\r\n       that not only is hydrogen removed, but also oxygen is combined;\r\n       thus, for example, nitric acid converts toluene, C_{7}H_{8},\r\n       into benzoic acid, C_{7}H_{6}O_{2}. In certain cases, also, a\r\n       portion of the carbon contained in an organic substance burns at\r\n       the expense of the oxygen of the nitric acid. So, for instance,\r\n       phthalic acid, C_{8}H_{6}O_{4}, is obtained from naphthalene,\r\n       _{10}H_{8}. Thus the action of nitric acid on the hydrocarbons\r\n       is often most complex; not only does nitrification take place,\r\n       but also separation of carbon, displacement of hydrogen, and\r\n       combination of oxygen. There are few organic substances which can\r\n       withstand the action of nitric acid, and it causes fundamental\r\n       changes in a number of them. It leaves a yellow stain on the\r\n       skin, and in a large quantity causes a wound and entirely eats\r\n       away the membranes of the body. The membranes of plants are eaten\r\n       into with the greatest ease by strong nitric acid in just the\r\n       same manner. One of the most durable blue vegetable dyes employed\r\n       in dyeing tissues is _indigo_; yet it is easily _converted into a\r\n       yellow substance_ by the action of nitric acid, and small traces\r\n       of free nitric acid may be recognised by this means.\r\n\r\nAs nitric acid is very easily decomposed with the separation of oxygen,\r\nit was for a long time supposed that it was not capable of forming the\r\ncorresponding _nitric anhydride_, N_{2}O_{5}; but Deville first and\r\nsubsequently Weber and others, discovered the methods of its formation.\r\nDeville obtained nitric anhydride by decomposing silver nitrate by\r\nchlorine under the influence of a moderate heat. Chlorine acts on\r\nthe above salt at a temperature of 95° (2AgNO_{3} + Cl_{2} = 2AgCl +\r\nN_{2}O_{5} + O), and when once the reaction is started, it continues\r\nby itself without further heating. Brown fumes are given off, which\r\nare condensed in a tube surrounded by a freezing-mixture. A portion\r\ncondenses in this tube and a portion remains in a gaseous state. The\r\nlatter contains free oxygen. A crystalline mass and a liquid substance\r\nare obtained in the tube; the liquid is poured off, and a current of dry\r\ncarbonic acid gas is passed through the apparatus in order to remove\r\nall traces of volatile substances (liquid oxides of nitrogen) adhering\r\nto the crystals of nitric anhydride. These form a voluminous mass of\r\nrhombic crystals (density 1·64), which sometimes are of rather large\r\nsize; they melt at about 30° and distil at about 47°. In distilling,\r\na portion of the substance is decomposed. With water these crystals\r\ngive nitric acid. Nitric anhydride is also obtained by the action of\r\nphosphoric anhydride, P_{2}O_{5}, on cold pure nitric acid (below\r\n0°). During the very careful distillation of equal parts by weight\r\nof these two substances a portion of the acid decomposes, giving a\r\nliquid compound, H_{2}O,2N_{2}O_{5} = N_{2}O_{5},2HNO_{3}, whilst the\r\ngreater part of the nitric acid gives the anhydride according to the\r\nequation 2NHO_{3} + P_{2}O_{5} = 2PHO_{3} + N_{2}O_{5}. On heating,\r\nnitric anhydride decomposes with an explosion, or gradually, into nitric\r\nperoxide and oxygen, N_{2}O_{5} = N_{2}O_{4} + O.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen peroxide_, N_{2}O_{4}, and _nitrogen dioxide_, NO_{2}, express\r\none and the same composition, but they should be distinguished like\r\nordinary oxygen and ozone, although in this case their mutual conversion\r\nis more easily effected and takes place on vaporisation; also, O_{3}\r\nloses heat in passing into O_{2}, whilst N_{2}O_{4} absorbs heat in\r\nforming NO_{2}.\r\n\r\nNitric acid in acting on tin and on many organic substances (for\r\nexample, starch) gives brown vapours, consisting of a mixture of\r\nN_{2}O_{3} and NO_{2}. A purer product is obtained by the decomposition\r\nof lead nitrate by heat, Pb(NO_{3})_{2} = 2NO_{2} + O + PbO, when\r\nnon-volatile lead oxide, oxygen gas, and nitrogen peroxide are formed.\r\nThe latter condenses, in a well-cooled vessel, to a brown liquid, which\r\nboils at about 22°. The purest peroxide of nitrogen, solidifying at -9°,\r\nis obtained by mixing dry oxygen in a freezing-mixture with twice its\r\nvolume of dry nitric oxide, NO, when transparent prisms of nitrogen\r\nperoxide are formed in the receiver: they melt into a colourless liquid\r\nat about -10°. When the temperature of the receiver is above -9°, the\r\ncrystals melt,[44] and at 0° give a reddish yellow liquid, like that\r\nobtained in the decomposition of lead nitrate. The vapours of nitrogen\r\nperoxide have a characteristic odour, and at the ordinary temperature\r\nare of a dark-brown colour, but at lower temperatures the colour of\r\nthe vapour is much fainter. When heated, especially above 50°, the\r\ncolour becomes a very dark brown, so that the vapours almost lose their\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\n  [44] According to certain investigations, if a brown liquid is formed\r\n       from the melted crystals by beating above -9°, then they no longer\r\n       solidify at -10°, probably because a certain amount of N_{2}O_{3}\r\n       (and oxygen) is formed, and this substance remains liquid at\r\n       -30°, or it may be that the passage from 2NO_{2} into N_{2}O_{4}\r\n       is not so easily accomplished as the passage from N_{2}O_{4} into\r\n       2NO_{2}.\r\n\r\n       Liquid nitrogen peroxide (that is, a mixture of NO_{2} and\r\n       N_{2}O_{4}) is employed in admixture with hydrocarbons as an\r\n       explosive.\r\n\r\nThe causes of these peculiarities of nitrogen peroxide were not\r\nclearly understood until Deville and Troost determined the density and\r\ndissociation of the vapour of this substance at different temperatures,\r\nand showed that the density varies. If the density be referred to that\r\nof hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure, then it is found to\r\nvary from 38 at the boiling point, or about 27°, to 23 at 135°, after\r\nwhich the density remains constant up to those high temperatures at\r\nwhich the oxides of nitrogen are decomposed. As on the basis of the\r\nlaws enunciated in the following chapter, the density 23 corresponds\r\nwith the compound NO_{2} (because the weight corresponding with this\r\nmolecular formula = 46, and the density referred to hydrogen as unity\r\nis equal to half the molecular weight); therefore at temperatures above\r\n135° the existence of nitrogen dioxide only must be recognised. It is\r\nthis gas which is of a brown colour. At a lower temperature it forms\r\nnitrogen peroxide, N_{2}O_{4}, whose molecular weight, and therefore\r\ndensity, is twice that of the dioxide. This substance, which is isomeric\r\nwith nitrogen dioxide, as ozone is isomeric with oxygen, and has twice\r\nas great a vapour density (46 referred to hydrogen), is formed in\r\ngreater quantity the lower the temperature, and crystallises at -10°. The\r\nreasons both of the variation of the colour of the gas (N_{2}O_{4} gives\r\ncolourless and transparent vapours, whilst those of NO_{2} are brown\r\nand opaque) and the variation of the vapour density with the variation\r\nof temperature are thus made quite clear; and as at the boiling point\r\na density 38 was obtained, therefore at that temperature the vapours\r\nconsist of a mixture of 79 parts by weight of N_{2}O_{4} with 21 parts\r\nby weight of NO_{2}.[45] It is evident that a decomposition here takes\r\nplace the peculiarity of which consists in the fact that the product of\r\ndecomposition, NO_{2}, is polymerised (_i.e._ becomes denser, combines\r\nwith itself) at a lower temperature; that is, the reaction\r\n\r\n                      N_{2}O_{4} = NO_{2} + NO_{2}\r\n\r\nis a reversible reaction, and consequently the whole phenomenon\r\nrepresents a _dissociation_ in a homogeneous gaseous medium, where the\r\noriginal substance, N_{2}O_{4}, and the resultant, NO_{2}, are both\r\ngases. The _measure of dissociation_ will be expressed if we find the\r\nproportion of the quantity of the substance decomposed to the whole\r\namount of the substance. At the boiling point, therefore, the measure\r\nof the decomposition of nitrogen peroxide will be 21 p.c.; at 135° it =\r\n1, and at 10° it = 0; that is, the N_{2}O_{4} is not then decomposable.\r\nConsequently the limits of dissociation here are -10° and 135° at the\r\natmospheric pressure.[46] Within the limits of these temperatures the\r\nvapours of nitrogen peroxide have not a constant density, but, on the\r\nother hand, above and below these limits definite substances exist. Thus\r\nabove 135° N_{2}O_{4} has ceased to exist and NO_{2} alone remains.\r\nIt is evident that at the ordinary temperature there is a partially\r\ndissociated system or mixture of nitrogen peroxide, N_{2}O_{4}, and\r\nnitrogen dioxide, NO_{2}. In the brown liquid boiling at 22° probably\r\na portion of the N_{2}O_{4} has already passed into NO_{2}, and it is\r\nonly the colourless liquid and crystalline substance at -10° that can be\r\nconsidered as pure nitrogen peroxide.[47]\r\n\r\n  [45] Because if _x_ equal the amount by weight of N_{2}O_{4}, its\r\n       volume will = _x_/46, and the amount of NO_{2} will = 100-_x_,\r\n       and consequently its volume will = (100-_x_)/23. But the mixture,\r\n       having a density 38, will weigh 100; consequently its volume will\r\n       = 100/38. Hence _x_/46 + (100-_x_)/23 = 100/38, or _x_ = 79·O.\r\n\r\n  [46] The phenomena and laws of dissociation, which we shall consider\r\n       only in particular instances, are discussed in detail in works\r\n       on theoretical chemistry. Nevertheless, in respect to nitrogen\r\n       peroxide, as an historically important example of dissociation\r\n       in a homogeneous gaseous medium, we will cite the results of the\r\n       careful investigations (1885-1880) of E. and L. Natanson, who\r\n       determined the densities under various conditions of temperature\r\n       and pressure. The degree of dissociation, expressed as above (it\r\n       may also he expressed otherwise--for example, by the ratio of\r\n       the quantity of substance decomposed to that unaltered), proves\r\n       to increase at all temperatures as the pressure diminishes,\r\n       which would he expected for a homogeneous gaseous medium, as a\r\n       decreasing pressure aids the formation of the lightest product of\r\n       dissociation (that having the least density or largest volume).\r\n       Thus, in the Natansons' experiments the degree of dissociation\r\n       at 0° increases from 10 p.c. to 30 p.c., with a decrease of\r\n       pressure of from 251 to 38 mm.; at 49°·7 it increases from 49\r\n       p.c. to 93 p.c., with a fall of pressure of from 498 to 27 mm.,\r\n       and at 100° it increases from 89·2 p.c. to 99·7 p.c., with a\r\n       fall of pressure of from 732·5 to 11·7 mm. At 130° and 150° the\r\n       decomposition is complete--that is, only NO_{2} remains at the\r\n       low pressures (less than the atmospheric) at which the Natansons\r\n       made their determinations; but it is probable that at higher\r\n       pressures (of several atmospheres) molecules of N_{2}O_{4} would\r\n       still be formed, and it would be exceedingly interesting to trace\r\n       the phenomena under the conditions of both very considerable\r\n       pressures and of relatively large volumes.\r\n\r\n  [47] Liquid nitrogen peroxide is said by Geuther to boil at 22°-26°,\r\n       and to have a sp. gr. at 0° = 1·494 and at 15° = 1·474. It\r\n       is evident that, in the liquid as in the gaseous state, the\r\n       variation of density with the temperature depends, not only\r\n       on physical, but also on chemical changes, as the amount of\r\n       N_{2}O_{4} decreases and the amount of NO_{2} increases with\r\n       the temperature, and they (as polymeric substances) should\r\n       have different densities, as we find, for instance, in the\r\n       hydrocarbons C_{5}H_{10} and C_{10}H_{20}.\r\n\r\n       It may not be superfluous to mention here that the measurement\r\n       of the specific heat of a mixture of the vapours of N_{2}O_{4}\r\n       and NO_{2} enabled Berthelot to determine that the transformation\r\n       of 2NO_{2} into N_{2}O_{4} is accompanied by the evolution of\r\n       about 13,000 units of heat, and as the reaction proceeds with\r\n       equal facility in either direction, it will be exothermal in the\r\n       one direction and endothermal in the other; and this clearly\r\n       demonstrates the possibility of reactions taking place in either\r\n       direction, although, as a rule, reactions evolving heat proceed\r\n       with greater ease.\r\n\r\nThe above explains the action of nitrogen peroxide on water at low\r\ntemperatures. N_{2}O_{4} then acts on water like a mixture of the\r\nanhydrides of nitrous and nitric acids. The first, N_{2}O_{3}, may\r\nbe looked on as water in which each of the two atoms of hydrogen is\r\nreplaced by the radicle NO, while in the second each hydrogen is\r\nreplaced by the radicle NO_{2}, proper to nitric acid; and in nitrogen\r\nperoxide one atom of the hydrogen of water is replaced by NO and the\r\nother by NO_{2}, as is seen from the formulæ--\r\n\r\n               H}       NO}         NO    }        NO_{2}}\r\n               H} O;    NO} O;      NO_{2}} O;     NO_{2}} O;\r\n\r\n  or           H_{2}O;  N_{2}O{3};  N_{2}O_{4};  N_{2}O_{5}.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nitrogen peroxide at low temperatures gives with water (ice)\r\nboth nitric, HNO_{3}, and nitrous, HNO_{2}, acids. The latter, as\r\nwe shall afterwards see, splits up into water and the anhydride,\r\nN_{2}O_{3}. If, however, warm water act on nitrogen peroxide, only\r\nnitric acid and monoxide of nitrogen are formed: 3NO_{2} + H_{2}O = NO +\r\n2NHO_{3}.\r\n\r\nAlthough NO_{2} is not decomposed into N and O even at 500°, still\r\nin many cases it acts as an oxidising agent. Thus, for instance, it\r\noxidises mercury, converting it into mercurous nitrate, 2NO_{2} + Hg\r\n= HgNO_{3} + NO, being itself deoxidised into nitric oxide, into which\r\nthe dioxide in many other instances passes, and from which it is easily\r\nformed.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Nitric acid of sp. gr. 1·51 in dissolving nitrogen peroxide becomes\r\n       brown, whilst nitric acid of sp. gr. 1·32 is coloured greenish\r\n       blue, and acid of sp. gr. below 1·15 remains colourless after\r\n       absorbing nitrogen peroxide (Note 33).\r\n\r\n_Nitrous anhydride_, N_{2}O_{3}, corresponds[49] to nitrous acid,\r\nNHO_{2}, which forms a series of salts, the nitrites--for example,\r\nthe sodium salt NaNO_{2}, the potassium salt KNO_{2}, the ammonium\r\nsalt (NH_{4})NO_{2},[50] the silver salt AgNO_{2},[51] &c. Neither\r\nthe anhydride nor the hydrate of the acid is known in a perfectly\r\npure state. The anhydride has only been obtained as a very unstable\r\nsubstance, and has not yet been fully investigated; and on attempting\r\nto obtain the acid NHO_{2} from its salts, it always gives water and\r\nthe anhydride, whilst the latter, as an intermediate oxide, partially\r\nor wholly splits up into NO + NO_{2}. But the salts of nitrous acid are\r\ndistinguished for their great stability. Potassium nitrate, KNO_{3}, may\r\nbe converted into potassium nitrite by depriving it of a portion of\r\nits oxygen; for instance, by fusing it (at not too high a temperature)\r\nwith metals, such as lead, KNO_{3} + Pb = KNO_{2} + PbO.[51 bis]\r\nThe resultant salt is soluble in water, whilst the oxide of lead is\r\ninsoluble. With sulphuric and other acids the solution of potassium\r\nnitrite[52] immediately evolves a brown gas, nitrous anhydride:\r\n2KNO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = K_{2}SO_{4} + N_{2}O_{3} + H_{2}O. The same\r\ngas (N_{2}O_{3}) is obtained by passing nitric oxide at 0° through\r\nliquid peroxide of nitrogen,[53] or by heating starch with nitric acid\r\nof sp. gr. 1·3. At a very low temperature it condenses into a blue\r\nliquid boiling below 0°,[54] but then partially decomposing into NO +\r\nNO_{2}. Nitrous anhydride possesses a remarkable capacity for oxidising.\r\nIgnited bodies burn in it, nitric acid absorbs it, and then acquires\r\nthe property of acting on silver and other metals, even when diluted.\r\n_Potassium iodide_ is oxidised by this gas just as it is by ozone (and\r\nby peroxide of hydrogen, chromic and other acids, but not by dilute\r\nnitric acid nor by sulphuric acid), with the _separation of iodine_.\r\nThis iodine may he recognised (_see_ Ozone, Chapter IV.) by its turning\r\nstarch blue. Very small traces of nitrites may be easily detected by\r\nthis method. If, for example, starch and potassium iodide are added\r\nto a solution of potassium nitrite (at first there will be no change,\r\nthere being no free nitrous acid), and then sulphuric acid be added, the\r\nnitrous acid (or its anhydride) immediately set free liberates iodine,\r\nwhich produces a blue colour with the starch. Nitric acid does not act\r\nin this manner, but in the presence of zinc the coloration takes place,\r\nwhich proves the formation of nitrous acid in the deoxidation of nitric\r\nacid.[55] Nitrous acid acts directly on ammonia, forming nitrogen and\r\nwater, HNO_{2} + NH_{3} = N_{2} + 2H_{2}O.[56]\r\n\r\n  [49] Nitrogen peroxide as a mixed substance has no corresponding\r\n       independent salts, but Sabatier and Senderens (1892) showed that\r\n       under certain conditions NO_{2} combines directly with some\r\n       metals--for instance, copper and cobalt--forming Cu_{2}NO_{2} and\r\n       CoNO_{2} as dark brown powders, which do not, however, exhibit\r\n       the reactions of salts. Thus by passing gaseous nitrogen dioxide\r\n       over freshly reduced (from the oxides by heating with hydrogen)\r\n       copper at 25°-30°, Cu_{2}NO_{2} is directly formed. With water\r\n       it partly gives off NO_{2} and partly forms nitrite of copper,\r\n       leaving metallic copper and its suboxide. The nature of these\r\n       compounds has not yet been sufficiently investigated.\r\n\r\n  [50] Ammonium nitrite may be easily obtained in solution by a similar\r\n       method of double decomposition (for instance, of the barium salt\r\n       with ammonium sulphate) to the other salts of nitrous acid, but\r\n       it decomposes with great ease when evaporated, with evolution\r\n       of gaseous nitrogen, as already mentioned (Chapter V.) If the\r\n       solution, however, be evaporated at the ordinary temperature\r\n       under the receiver of an air-pump, a solid saline mass is\r\n       obtained, which is easily decomposed when heated. The dry salt\r\n       even decomposes with an explosion when struck, or when heated to\r\n       about 70°--NH_{4}NO_{2} = 2H_{2}O + N_{2}. It is also formed by\r\n       the action of aqueous ammonia on a mixture of nitric oxide and\r\n       oxygen, or by the action of ozone on ammonia, and in many other\r\n       instances. Zörensen (1894) prepared NH_{4}NO_{2} by the action\r\n       of a mixture of N_{2}O_{3} and other oxides of nitrogen on lumps\r\n       of ammonium carbonate, extracting the nitrite of ammonium formed\r\n       with absolute alcohol, and precipitating it from this solution\r\n       by ether. This salt is crystalline, dissolves in water with\r\n       absorption of heat, and attracts moisture from the air. The solid\r\n       salt and its concentrated solutions decompose with an explosion\r\n       when heated to 50°-80°, especially in the presence of traces\r\n       of foreign acids. Decomposition also proceeds at the ordinary\r\n       temperature, but more slowly; and in order to preserve the salt\r\n       it should be covered with a layer of pure dry ether.\r\n\r\n  [51] Silver nitrite, AgNO_{2}, is obtained as a very slightly soluble\r\n       substance, as a precipitate, on mixing solutions of silver\r\n       nitrate, AgNO_{3}, and potassium nitrite, KNO_{2}. It is soluble\r\n       in a large volume of water, and this is taken advantage of\r\n       to free it from silver oxide, which is also present in the\r\n       precipitate, owing to the fact that potassium nitrite always\r\n       contains a certain amount of oxide, which with water gives the\r\n       hydroxide, forming oxide of silver with silver nitrate. The\r\n       solution of silver nitrite gives, by double decomposition with\r\n       metallic chlorides (for instance, barium chloride), insoluble\r\n       silver chloride and the nitrite of the metal taken (in this case,\r\n       barium nitrite, Ba(NO_{2})_{2}).\r\n\r\n  [51 bis] Leroy (1889) obtained KNO_{2} by mixing powdered KNO_{3} with\r\n       BaS, igniting the mixture in a crucible and washing the fused\r\n       salts; BaSO_{4} is then left as an insoluble residue, and KNO_{2}\r\n       passes into solution: 4KNO_{3} + BaS = 4KNO_{2} + BaSO_{4}.\r\n\r\n  [52] Probably potassium nitrite, KNO_{2}, when strongly heated,\r\n       especially with metallic oxides, evolves N and O, and gives\r\n       potassium oxide, K_{2}O, because nitre is liable to such a\r\n       decomposition; but it has, as yet, been but little investigated.\r\n\r\n  [53] There are many researches which lead to the conclusion that the\r\n       reaction N_{2}O_{3} = NO_{2}-NO is reversible, _i.e._ resembles\r\n       the conversion of N_{2}O_{4} into NO_{2}. The brown colour of the\r\n       fumes of N_{2}O_{3} is due to the formation of NO_{2}.\r\n\r\n       If nitrogen peroxide be cooled to -20°, and half its weight\r\n       of water be added to it drop by drop, then the peroxide is\r\n       decomposed, as we have already said, into nitrous and nitric\r\n       acids; the former does not then remain as a hydrate, but\r\n       straightway passes into the anhydride, and, hence, if the\r\n       resultant liquid be slightly warmed vapours of nitrous anhydride,\r\n       N_{2}O_{3}, are evolved, and condense into a blue liquid, as\r\n       Fritzsche showed. This method of preparing nitrous anhydride\r\n       apparently gives the purest product, but it easily dissociates,\r\n       forming NO and NO_{2} (and therefore also nitric acid in the\r\n       presence of water).\r\n\r\n  [54] According to Thorpe, N_{2}O_{3} boils at +18°. According to\r\n       Geuther, at +3°·5, and its sp. gr. at 0° = 1·449.\r\n\r\n  [55] In its oxidising action nitrous anhydride gives nitric oxide,\r\n       N_{2}O_{3} = 2NO + O. Thus its analogy to ozone becomes still\r\n       more marked, because in ozone it is only one-third of the oxygen\r\n       that acts in oxidising; from O_{3} there is obtained O, which\r\n       acts as an oxidiser, and common oxygen O_{2}. In a physical\r\n       aspect the relation between N_{2}O_{3} and O_{3} is revealed in\r\n       the fact that both substances are of a blue colour when in the\r\n       liquid state.\r\n\r\n  [56] This reaction is taken advantage of for converting the amides,\r\n       NH_{2}R (where R is an element or a complex group) into\r\n       hydroxides, RHO. In this case NH_{2}R + NHO_{2} forms 2N\r\n       + H_{2}O + RHO; NH_{2}, is replaced by HO, the radicle of\r\n       ammonia by the radicle of water. This reaction is employed\r\n       for transforming many nitrogenous organic substances having\r\n       the properties of amides into their corresponding hydroxides.\r\n       Thus aniline, C_{6}H_{5}·NH_{2}, which is obtained from\r\n       nitrobenzene, C_{6}H_{5}·NO_{2} (Note 37), is converted by\r\n       nitrous anhydride into phenol, C_{6}H_{5}·OH, which occurs in the\r\n       creosote extracted from coal tar. Thus the H of the benzene is\r\n       successively replaced by NO_{2}, NH_{2}, and HO; a method which\r\n       is suitable for other cases also.\r\n\r\nAs nitrous anhydride easily splits up into NO_{2} + NO, so, like NO_{2},\r\nwith warm water it gives nitric acid and nitric oxide, according to the\r\nequation 3N_{2}O_{3} + H_{2}O = 4NO + 2NHO_{3}.\r\n\r\nBeing in a lower degree of oxidation than nitric acid, nitrous\r\nacid and its anhydride are oxidised in solutions by many oxidising\r\nsubstances--for example, by potassium permanganate--into nitric acid.[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] The action of a solution of potassium permanganate, KMnO_{4},\r\n       on nitrous acid in the presence of sulphuric acid is determined\r\n       by the fact that the higher oxide of manganese, Mn_{2}O_{7},\r\n       contained in the permanganate is converted into the lower oxide,\r\n       MnO, which as a base forms manganese sulphate, MnSO_{4}, and\r\n       the oxygen serves for the oxidation of the N_{2}O_{3} into\r\n       N_{2}O_{5}, or its hydrate. As the solution of the permanganate\r\n       is of a red colour, whilst that of manganese sulphate is almost\r\n       colourless, this reaction is clearly seen, and may be employed\r\n       for the detection and determination of nitrous acid and its salts.\r\n\r\n_Nitric oxide_, NO.--This permanent gas[58] (that is, unliquefiable\r\nby pressure without the aid of cold) may be obtained from all the\r\nabove-described compounds of nitrogen with oxygen. The deoxidation of\r\nnitric acid by metals is the usual method employed for its preparation.\r\nDilute nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·18, but not stronger, as then N_{2}O_{3}\r\nand NO_{2} are produced) is poured into a flask containing metallic\r\ncopper.[59] The reaction commences at the ordinary temperature. Mercury\r\nand silver also give nitric oxide with nitric acid. In these reactions\r\nwith metals one portion of the nitric acid is employed in the oxidation\r\nof the metal, whilst the other, and by far the greater, portion combines\r\nwith the metallic oxide so obtained, with formation of the nitrate\r\ncorresponding with the metal taken. The first action of the copper on\r\nthe nitric acid is thus expressed by the equation\r\n\r\n                  2NHO_{3} + 3Cu = H_{2}O + 3CuO + 2NO.\r\n\r\nThe second reaction consists in the formation of copper nitrate--\r\n\r\n              6NHO_{3} + 3CuO = 3H_{2}O + 3Cu(NO_{3})_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [58] The absolute boiling point = -93° (_see_ Chapter II., Note 29).\r\n\r\n  [59] Kammerer proposed preparing nitric oxide, NO, by pouring a solution\r\n       of sodium nitrate over copper shavings, and adding sulphuric\r\n       acid drop by drop. The oxidation of ferrous salts by nitric acid\r\n       also gives NO. One part of strong hydrochloric acid is taken and\r\n       iron is dissolved in it (FeCl_{2}), and then an equal quantity\r\n       of hydrochloric acid and nitre is added to the solution. On\r\n       heating, nitric oxide is evolved. In the presence of an excess\r\n       of sulphuric acid and mercury the conversion of nitric acid into\r\n       nitric oxide is complete (that is, the reaction proceeds to the\r\n       end and the nitric oxide is obtained without other products), and\r\n       upon this is founded one of the methods for determining nitric\r\n       acid (in nitrometers of various kinds, described in text-books\r\n       of analytical chemistry), as the amount of NO can be easily\r\n       and accurately measured volumetrically. The amount of nitrogen\r\n       in gun-cotton, for instance, is determined by dissolving it in\r\n       sulphuric acid. Nitrous acid acts in the same manner. Upon this\r\n       property Emich (1892) founds his method for preparing pure NO.\r\n       He pours mercury into a flask, and then covers it with sulphuric\r\n       acid, in which a certain amount of NaNO_{2} or other substance\r\n       corresponding to HNO_{2} or HNO_{3} has been dissolved. The\r\n       evolution of NO proceeds at the ordinary temperature, being more\r\n       rapid as the surface of the mercury is increased (if shaken, the\r\n       reaction proceeds very rapidly). If the gas be passed over KHO,\r\n       it is obtained quite pure, because KHO does not act upon NO at\r\n       the ordinary temperature (if heated, KNO_{2} and N_{2}O or N_{2},\r\n       are formed).\r\n\r\nNitric oxide is a colourless gas which is only slightly soluble in\r\nwater (1/20 of a volume at the ordinary temperature). Reactions of\r\ndouble decomposition in which nitric oxide readily takes part are not\r\nknown--that is to say, it is an indifferent, not a saline, oxide.\r\nLike the other oxides of nitrogen, it is decomposed into its elements\r\nat a red heat (starting from 900°, at 1,200° 60 per cent. give N_{2}\r\nand 2N_{2}O_{3}, but complete decomposition into N_{2} and O_{2} only\r\ntakes place at the melting point of platinum, Emich 1892). The most\r\ncharacteristic property of nitric oxide is its capacity for directly\r\nand easily combining with oxygen (owing to the evolution of heat in\r\nthe combination). With oxygen it forms nitrous anhydride and nitrogen\r\nperoxide, 2NO + O = N_{2}O_{3}, 2NO + O_{2} = 2NO_{2}. If nitric oxide\r\nis mixed with oxygen and immediately shaken up with caustic potash,\r\nit is almost entirely converted into potassium nitrite; whilst after\r\na certain time, when the formation of nitric peroxide has already\r\ncommenced, a mixture of potassium nitrite and nitrate is obtained.\r\nIf oxygen is passed into a bell jar filled with nitric oxide, brown\r\nfumes of nitrous anhydride and nitric peroxide are formed, even in the\r\nabsence of moisture; these in the presence of water give, as we already\r\nknow, nitric acid and nitric oxide, so that in the presence of an\r\nexcess of water and oxygen the whole of the nitric oxide is easily and\r\ndirectly converted into nitric acid. This reaction of the re-formation\r\nof nitric acid from nitric oxide, air, and water, 2NO + H_{2}O + O_{3}\r\n= 2HNO_{3}, is frequently made use of in practice. The experiment\r\nshowing the conversion of nitric oxide into nitric acid is very striking\r\nand instructive. As the intermixture of the oxygen with the oxide of\r\nnitrogen proceeds, the nitric acid formed dissolves in water, and if an\r\nexcess of oxygen has not been added the whole of the gas (nitric oxide),\r\nbeing converted into HNO_{3}, is absorbed, and the water entirely fills\r\nthe bell jar previously containing the gas.[60] It is evident that\r\nnitric oxide[61] in combining with oxygen has a strong tendency to give\r\nthe higher types of nitrogen compounds, which we see in nitric acid,\r\nHNO_{3} or NO_{2}(OH), in nitric anhydride, N_{2}O_{5} or (NO_{2})_{2}O,\r\nand in ammonium chloride, NH_{4}Cl. If X stand for an atom of hydrogen,\r\nor its equivalents, chlorine, hydroxyl, &c., and if O, which is,\r\naccording to the law of substitution, equivalent to H_{2}, be indicated\r\nby X_{2}, then the three compounds of nitrogen above named should be\r\nconsidered as compounds of the type or form NX_{5}. For example, in\r\nnitric acid X_{5} = O_{2} + (OH), where O_{2} = X_{4}, and OH = X;\r\nwhilst nitric oxide is a compound of the form NX_{2}. Hence this lower\r\nform, like lower forms in general, strives by combination to attain to\r\nthe higher forms proper to the compounds of a given element. NX_{2}\r\npasses consecutively into NX_{3}--namely, into N_{2}O_{3} and NHO_{2},\r\nNX_{4} (for instance NO_{2}) and NX_{5}.\r\n\r\n  [60] This transformation of the permanent gases nitric oxide and oxygen\r\n       into liquid nitric acid in the presence of water, and with\r\n       the evolution of heat, presents a most striking instance\r\n       of liquefaction produced by the action of chemical forces.\r\n       They perform with ease the work which physical (cooling) and\r\n       mechanical (pressure) forces effect with difficulty. In this the\r\n       motion, which is so distinctively the property of the gaseous\r\n       molecules, is apparently destroyed. In other cases of chemical\r\n       action it is apparently created, arising, no doubt, from latent\r\n       energy--that is, from the internal motion of the atoms in the\r\n       molecules.\r\n\r\n  [61] Nitric oxide is capable of entering into many characteristic\r\n       combinations; it is absorbed by the solutions of many acids, for\r\n       instance, tartaric, acetic, phosphoric, sulphuric, and metallic\r\n       chlorides (for example, SbCl_{5}, BiCl_{3}, &c., with which it\r\n       forms definite compounds; Besson 1889), and also by the solutions\r\n       of many salts, especially those formed by suboxide of iron (for\r\n       instance, ferrous sulphate). In this case a brown compound is\r\n       formed which is exceedingly unstable, like all the analogous\r\n       compounds of nitric oxide. The amount of nitric oxide combined\r\n       in this manner is in atomic proportion with the amount of the\r\n       substance taken; thus ferrous sulphate, FeSO_{4}, absorbs it in\r\n       the proportion of NO to 2FeSO_{4}. Ammonia is obtained by the\r\n       action of a caustic alkali on the resultant compound, because\r\n       the oxygen of the nitric oxide and water are transferred to the\r\n       ferrous oxide, forming ferric oxide, whilst the nitrogen combines\r\n       with the hydrogen of the water. According to the investigations\r\n       of Gay (1885), the compound is formed with the evolution of\r\n       a large quantity of heat, and is easily dissociated, like a\r\n       solution of ammonia in water. It is evident that oxidising\r\n       substances (for example, potassium permanganate, KMnO_{4}, Note\r\n       57) are able to convert it into nitric acid. If the presence\r\n       of a radicle NO_{2}, composed like nitrogen peroxide, must be\r\n       recognised in the compounds of nitric acid, then a radicle NO,\r\n       having the composition of nitric oxide, may be admitted in the\r\n       compounds of nitrous acid. The compounds in which the radicle NO\r\n       is recognised are called _nitroso-compounds_. These substances\r\n       are described in Prof. Bunge's work (Kief, 1868).\r\n\r\nAs the decomposition of nitric oxide begins at temperatures above 900°,\r\nmany substances burn in it; thus, ignited phosphorus continues to burn\r\nin nitric oxide, but sulphur and charcoal are extinguished in it. This\r\nis due to the fact that the heat evolved in the combustion of these two\r\nsubstances is insufficient for the decomposition of the nitric oxide,\r\nwhilst the heat developed by burning phosphorus suffices to produce this\r\ndecomposition. That nitric oxide really supports combustion, owing to\r\nits being decomposed by the action of heat, is proved by the fact that\r\nstrongly ignited charcoal continues to burn in the same nitric oxide[62]\r\nin which a feebly incandescent piece of charcoal is extinguished.\r\n\r\n  [62] A mixture of nitric oxide and hydrogen is inflammable. If a\r\n       mixture of the two gases be passed over spongy platinum the\r\n       nitrogen and hydrogen even combine, forming ammonia. A mixture\r\n       of nitric oxide with many combustible vapours and gases is very\r\n       inflammable. A very characteristic flame is obtained in burning a\r\n       mixture of nitric oxide and the vapour of the combustible carbon\r\n       bisulphide, CS_{2}. The latter substance is very volatile, so\r\n       that it is sufficient to pass the nitric oxide through a layer\r\n       of the carbon bisulphide (for instance, in a Woulfe's bottle)\r\n       in order that the gas escaping should contain a considerable\r\n       amount of the vapours of this substance. This mixture continues\r\n       to burn when ignited, and the flame emits a large quantity of\r\n       the so-called ultra-violet rays, which are capable of inducing\r\n       chemical combinations and decompositions, and therefore the flame\r\n       may be employed in photography in the absence of sufficient\r\n       daylight (magnesium light and electric light have the same\r\n       property). There are many gases (for instance, ammonia) which\r\n       when mixed with nitric oxide explode in a eudiometer.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of nitrogen with oxygen which we have so far considered\r\nmay all be prepared from nitric oxide, and may themselves be converted\r\ninto it. Thus nitric oxide stands in intimate connection with them.[63]\r\nThe passage of nitric oxide into the higher degrees of oxidation and the\r\nconverse reaction is employed in practice as a means for _transferring_\r\nthe oxygen of the air to substances capable of being oxidised. Starting\r\nwith nitric oxide, it may easily be converted, with the aid of the\r\noxygen of the atmosphere and water, into nitric acid, nitrous anhydride,\r\nand nitric peroxide, and by their means employed to oxidise other\r\nsubstances. In this oxidising action nitric oxide is again formed, and\r\nit may again be converted into nitric acid, and so on continuously,\r\nif only oxygen and water be present. Hence the fact, which at first\r\nappears to be a paradox, that by means of a small quantity of nitric\r\noxide in the presence of oxygen and water it is possible to oxidise\r\nan indefinitely large quantity of substances which cannot be directly\r\noxidised either by the action of the atmospheric oxygen or by the\r\naction of nitric oxide itself. The sulphurous anhydride, SO_{2}, which\r\nis obtained in the combustion of sulphur and in roasting many metallic\r\nsulphides in the air is an example of this kind. In practice this gas is\r\nobtained by burning sulphur or iron pyrites, the latter being thereby\r\nconverted into oxide of iron and sulphurous anhydride. In contact with\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere this gas does not pass into the higher\r\ndegree of oxidation, sulphuric anhydride, SO_{3}, and if it does form\r\nsulphuric acid with water and the oxygen of the atmosphere, SO_{2} +\r\nH_{2}O + O = H_{2}SO_{4}, it does so very slowly. With nitric acid (and\r\nespecially with nitrous acid, but not with nitrogen peroxide) and water,\r\nsulphurous anhydride, on the contrary, very easily forms sulphuric acid,\r\nand especially so when slightly heated (about 40°), the nitric acid (or,\r\nbetter still, nitrous acid) being converted into nitric oxide--\r\n\r\n           3SO_{2} + 2NHO_{3} + 2H_{2}O = 2H_{2}SO_{4} + 2NO.\r\n\r\n  [63] The oxides of nitrogen naturally do not proceed directly from\r\n       oxygen and nitrogen by contact alone, because their formation\r\n       is accompanied by the absorption of a large quantity of heat,\r\n       for (_see_ Note 29) about 21,500 heat units are absorbed when 16\r\n       parts of oxygen and 14 parts of nitrogen combine; consequently\r\n       the decomposition of nitric oxide into oxygen and nitrogen\r\n       is accompanied by the evolution of this amount of heat; and\r\n       therefore with nitric oxide, as with all explosive substances and\r\n       mixtures, the reaction once started is able to proceed by itself.\r\n       In fact, Berthelot remarked the decomposition of nitric oxide\r\n       in the explosion of fulminate of mercury. This decomposition\r\n       does not take place spontaneously; substances even burn with\r\n       difficulty in nitric oxide, probably because a certain portion of\r\n       the nitric oxide in decomposing gives oxygen, which combines with\r\n       another portion of nitric oxide, and forms nitric peroxide, a\r\n       somewhat more stable compound of nitrogen and oxygen. The further\r\n       combinations of nitric oxide with oxygen all proceed with the\r\n       evolution of heat, and take place spontaneously by contact with\r\n       air alone. It is evident from these examples that the application\r\n       of thermochemical data is limited.\r\n\r\nThe presence of water is absolutely indispensable here, otherwise\r\nsulphuric anhydride is formed, which combines with the oxides of\r\nnitrogen (nitrous anhydride), forming a crystalline substance containing\r\noxides of nitrogen (_chamber crystals_, which will be described in\r\nChapter XX.) Water destroys this compound, forming sulphuric acid\r\nand separating the oxides of nitrogen. The water must be taken in a\r\ngreater quantity than that required for the formation of the hydrate\r\nH_{2}SO_{4}, because the latter absorbs oxides of nitrogen. With an\r\nexcess of water, however, solution does not take place. If, in the above\r\nreaction, only water, sulphurous anhydride, and nitric or nitrous acid\r\nbe taken in a definite quantity, then a definite quantity of sulphuric\r\nacid and nitric oxide will be formed, according to the preceding\r\nequation; but there the reaction ends and the excess of sulphurous\r\nanhydride, if there be any, will remain unchanged. But if we add air and\r\nwater, then the nitric oxide will unite with the oxygen to form nitrogen\r\nperoxide, and the latter with water to form nitric and nitrous acids,\r\nwhich again give sulphuric acid from a fresh quantity of sulphurous\r\nanhydride. Nitric oxide is again formed, which is able to start the\r\noxidation afresh if there be sufficient air. Thus it is possible\r\nwith a definite quantity of nitric oxide to convert an indefinitely\r\nlarge quantity of sulphurous anhydride into sulphuric acid, water and\r\noxygen only being required.[64] This may be easily demonstrated by an\r\nexperiment on a small scale, if a certain quantity of nitric oxide be\r\nfirst introduced into a flask, and sulphurous anhydride, steam, and\r\noxygen be then continually passed in. Thus the above-described reaction\r\nmay be expressed in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  _n_SO_{2} + _n_O + (_n_ + _m_)H_{2}O + NO\r\n                                          = _n_H_{2}SO_{4},_m_H_{2}O + NO\r\n\r\nif we consider only the original substances and those finally formed.\r\nIn this way a definite quantity of nitric oxide may serve for the\r\nconversion of an indefinite quantity of sulphurous anhydride, oxygen,\r\nand water into sulphuric acid. In reality, however, there is a limit to\r\nthis, because air, and not pure oxygen, is employed for the oxidation,\r\nso that it is necessary to remove the nitrogen of the air and to\r\nintroduce a fresh quantity of air. A certain quantity of nitric oxide\r\nwill pass away with this nitrogen, and will in this way be lost.[65]\r\n\r\n  [64] The instance of the action of a small quantity of NO in inducing\r\n       a definite chemical reaction between large masses (SO_{2} +\r\n       O + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4}) is very instructive, because the\r\n       particulars relating to it have been studied, and show that\r\n       intermediate forms of reaction may be discovered in the so-called\r\n       contact or catalytic phenomena. The essence of the matter here is\r\n       that A (= SO_{2}) reacts upon B (= O and H_{2}O) in the presence\r\n       of C, because it gives BC, a substance which forms AB with A, and\r\n       again liberates C. Consequently C is a medium, a transferring\r\n       substance, without which the reaction does not proceed. Many\r\n       similar phenomena may be found in other departments of life. Thus\r\n       the merchant is an indispensable medium between the producer\r\n       and the consumer; experiment is a medium between the phenomena\r\n       of nature and the cognisant faculties, and language, customs,\r\n       and laws are media which are as necessary for the exchanges of\r\n       social intercourse as nitric oxide for those between sulphurous\r\n       anhydride and oxygen and water.\r\n\r\n  [65] If the sulphurous anhydride be prepared by roasting iron pyrites,\r\n       FeS_{2}, then each equivalent of pyrites (equivalent of iron,\r\n       56, of sulphur 32, of pyrites 120) requires six equivalents of\r\n       oxygen (that is 96 parts) for the conversion of its sulphur\r\n       into sulphuric acid (for forming 2H_{2}SO_{4} with water),\r\n       besides 1-1/2 equivalents (24 parts) for converting the iron\r\n       into oxide, Fe_{2}O_{3}; hence the combustion of the pyrites for\r\n       the formation of sulphuric acid and ferric oxide requires the\r\n       introduction of an equal weight of oxygen (120 parts of oxygen to\r\n       120 parts of pyrites), or five times its weight of air, whilst\r\n       four parts by weight of nitrogen will remain inactive, and in the\r\n       removal of the exhausted air will carry off the remaining nitric\r\n       oxide. If not all, at least a large portion of the nitric oxide\r\n       may be collected by passing the escaping air, still containing\r\n       some oxygen, through substances which absorb oxides of nitrogen.\r\n       Sulphuric acid itself may be employed for this purpose if it be\r\n       used in the form of the hydrate H_{2}SO_{4}, or containing only\r\n       a small amount of water, because such sulphuric acid dissolves\r\n       the oxides of nitrogen. They may be easily expelled from this\r\n       solution by heating or by dilution with water, as they are only\r\n       slightly soluble in aqueous sulphuric acid. Besides which,\r\n       sulphurous anhydride acts on such sulphuric acid, being oxidised\r\n       at the expense of the nitrous anhydride, and forming nitric\r\n       oxide from it, which again enters into the cycle of action. For\r\n       this reason the sulphuric acid which has absorbed the oxides of\r\n       nitrogen escaping from the chambers in the tower K (_see_ fig.\r\n       50) is led back into the first chamber, where it comes into\r\n       contact with sulphurous anhydride, by which means the oxides of\r\n       nitrogen are reintroduced into the reaction which proceeds in\r\n       the chambers. This is the use of the towers (Gay-Lussac's and\r\n       Glover's) which are erected at either end of the chambers.\r\n\r\nThe preceding series of changes serve as the basis of the _manufacture\r\nof sulphuric acid_ or so-called _chamber acid_. This acid is prepared\r\non a very large scale in chemical works because it is the cheapest acid\r\nwhose action can be applied in a great number of cases. It is therefore\r\nused in immense quantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Section of sulphuric acid chambers, the first\r\nand last chambers only being represented. The tower to the left is\r\ncalled the Glover's tower, and that on the right the Gay-Lussac's tower.\r\nLess than 1/10th of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe process is carried on in a series of chambers (or in one divided\r\nby partitions as in fig. 50, which shows the beginning and end of a\r\nchamber) constructed of sheet lead. These chambers are placed one\r\nagainst the other, and communicate by tubes or special orifices so\r\nplaced that the inlet tubes are in the upper portion of the chamber, and\r\nthe outlet in the lower and opposite end. The current of steam and gases\r\nnecessary for the preparation of the sulphuric acid passes through these\r\nchambers and tubes. The acid as it is formed falls to the bottom of the\r\nchambers or runs down their walls, and flows from chamber to chamber\r\n(from the last towards the first), to permit of which the partitions\r\ndo not reach to the bottom. The floor and walls of the chambers should\r\ntherefore be made of a material on which the sulphuric acid will not\r\nact. Among the ordinary metals lead is the only one suitable.[65 bis]\r\n\r\n  [65 bis] Other metals, iron, copper, zinc, are corroded by it;\r\n       glass and china are not acted upon, but they crack from the\r\n       variations of temperature taking place in the chambers, and\r\n       besides they are more difficult to join properly than lead; wood,\r\n       &c., becomes charred.\r\n\r\nFor the formation of the sulphuric acid it is necessary to introduce\r\nsulphurous anhydride, steam, air, and nitric acid, or some oxide of\r\nnitrogen, into the chambers. The sulphurous anhydride is produced by\r\nburning sulphur or iron pyrites. This is carried on in the furnace with\r\nfour hearths to the left of the drawing. Air is led into the chambers\r\nand furnace through orifices in the furnace doors. The current of air\r\nand oxygen is regulated by opening or closing these orifices to a\r\ngreater or less extent. The ingoing draught in the chambers is brought\r\nabout by the fact that heated gases and vapours pass into the chambers,\r\nwhose temperature is further raised by the reaction itself, and also\r\nby the remaining nitrogen being continually withdrawn from the outlet\r\n(above the tower K) by a tall chimney situated near the chambers. Nitric\r\nacid is prepared from a mixture of sulphuric acid and Chili saltpetre,\r\nin the same furnaces in which the sulphurous anhydride is evolved (or in\r\nspecial furnaces). Not more than 8 parts of nitre are taken to 100 parts\r\nof sulphur burnt. On leaving the furnace the vapours of nitric acid and\r\noxides of nitrogen mixed with air and sulphurous anhydride first pass\r\nalong the horizontal tubes T into the receiver B B, which is partially\r\ncooled by water flowing in on the right-hand side and running out on the\r\nleft by _o_, in order to reduce the temperature of the gases entering\r\nthe chamber. The gases then pass up a tower filled with coke, and shown\r\nto the left of the drawing. In this tower are placed lumps of coke (the\r\nresidue from the dry distillation of coal), over which sulphuric acid\r\ntrickles from the reservoir M. This acid has absorbed in the end tower K\r\nthe oxides of nitrogen escaping from the chamber. This end tower is also\r\nfilled with coke, over which a stream of strong sulphuric acid trickles\r\nfrom the reservoir M. The acid spreads over the coke, and, owing to the\r\nlarge surface offered by the latter, absorbs the greater part of the\r\noxides of nitrogen escaping from the chambers. The sulphuric acid in\r\npassing down the tower becomes saturated with the oxides of nitrogen,\r\nand flows out at _h_ into a special receiver (in the drawing situated\r\nby the side of the furnaces), from which it is forced up the tubes _h´\r\nh´_ by steam pressure into the reservoir M, situated above the first\r\ntower. The gases passing through this tower (hot) from the furnace\r\non coming into contact with the sulphuric acid take up the oxides of\r\nnitrogen contained in it, and these are thus returned to the chamber and\r\nagain participate in the reaction. The sulphuric acid left after their\r\nextraction flows into the chambers. Thus, on leaving the first coke\r\ntower the sulphurous anhydride, air, and vapours of nitric acid and of\r\nthe oxides of nitrogen pass through the upper tube _m_ into the chamber.\r\nHere they come into contact with steam introduced by lead tubes into\r\nvarious parts of the chamber. The reaction takes place in the presence\r\nof water, the sulphuric acid falls to the bottom of the chamber, and the\r\nsame process takes place in the following chambers until the whole of\r\nthe sulphurous anhydride is consumed. A somewhat greater proportion of\r\nair than is strictly necessary is passed in, in order that no sulphurous\r\nanhydride should be left unaltered for want of sufficient oxygen. The\r\npresence of an excess of oxygen is shown by the colour of the gases\r\nescaping from the last chamber. If they be of a pale colour it indicates\r\nan insufficiency of air (and the presence of sulphurous anhydride), as\r\notherwise peroxide of nitrogen would be formed. A very dark colour shows\r\nan excess of air, which is also disadvantageous, because it increases\r\nthe inevitable loss of nitric oxide by increasing the mass of escaping\r\ngases.[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] By this means as much as 2,500,000 kilograms of chamber acid,\r\n       containing about 60 per cent. of the hydrate H_{2}SO_{4} and\r\n       about 40 per cent. of water, may be manufactured per year in one\r\n       plant of 5,000 cubic metres capacity (without stoppages). This\r\n       process has been brought to such a degree of perfection that\r\n       as much as 300 parts of the hydrate H_{2}SO_{4} are obtained\r\n       from 100 parts of sulphur, whilst the theoretical amount is\r\n       not greater than 306 parts. The acid parts with its excess of\r\n       water on heating. For this purpose it is heated in lead vessels.\r\n       However, the acid containing about 75 per cent. of the hydrate\r\n       (60° Baumé) already begins to act on the lead when heated,\r\n       and therefore the further removal of water is conducted by\r\n       evaporating in glass or platinum vessels, as will he described\r\n       in Chapter XX. The aqueous acid (50° Baumé) obtained in the\r\n       chambers is termed chamber acid. The acid concentrated to 60°\r\n       Baumé is more generally employed, and sometimes the hydrate (66°\r\n       Baumé) termed vitriol acid is also used. In England alone more\r\n       than 1,000 million kilograms of chamber acid are produced by\r\n       this method. The formation of sulphuric acid by the action of\r\n       nitric acid was discovered by Drebbel, and the first lead chamber\r\n       was erected by Roebuck, in Scotland, in the middle of the last\r\n       century. The essence of the process was only brought to light\r\n       at the beginning of this century, when many improvements were\r\n       introduced into practice.\r\n\r\n_Nitrous oxide_, N_{2}O,[67] is similar to water in its volumetric\r\ncomposition. Two volumes of nitrous oxide are formed from two volumes\r\nof nitrogen and one volume of oxygen, which may be shown by the\r\nordinary method for the analysis of the oxides of nitrogen (by passing\r\nthem over red-hot copper or sodium). In contradistinction to the other\r\noxides of nitrogen, it is not directly oxidised by oxygen, but it\r\nmay be obtained from the higher oxides of nitrogen by the action of\r\ncertain deoxidising substances; thus, for example, a mixture of two\r\nvolumes of nitric oxide and one volume of sulphurous anhydride if left\r\nin contact with water and spongy platinum is converted into sulphuric\r\nacid and nitrous oxide, 2NO + SO_{2} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4} + N_{2}O.\r\nNitric acid, also, under the action of certain metals--for instance, of\r\nzinc[68]--gives nitrous oxide, although in this case mixed with nitric\r\noxide. The usual method of preparing nitrous oxide consists in the\r\ndecomposition of ammonium nitrate by the aid of heat, because in this\r\ncase only water and nitrous oxide are formed, NH_{4}NO_{3} = 2H_{2}O\r\n+ N_{2}O (a mixture of NH_{4}Cl and KNO_{3} is sometimes taken). The\r\ndecomposition[69] proceeds very easily in an apparatus like that used\r\nfor the preparation of ammonia or oxygen--that is, in a retort or flask\r\nwith a gas-conducting tube. The decomposition must, however, be carried\r\non carefully, as otherwise nitrogen is formed from the decomposition of\r\nthe nitrous oxide.[70]\r\n\r\n  [67] If the hydrate HNO_{3} corresponds to N_{2}O_{4}, the hydrate HNO,\r\n       _hyponitrous acid_, corresponds to N_{2}O, and in this\r\n       sense N_{2}O is _hyponitrous anhydride_. Hyponitrous acid,\r\n       corresponding with nitrous oxide (as its anhydride), is not\r\n       known in a pure state, but its salts (Divers) are known. They\r\n       are prepared by the reduction of nitrous (and consequently of\r\n       nitric) salts by sodium amalgam. If this amalgam he added to a\r\n       cold solution of an alkaline nitrite until the evolution of gas\r\n       ceases, and the excess of alkali saturated with acetic acid,\r\n       an insoluble yellow precipitate of silver hyponitrite, NAgO,\r\n       will he obtained on adding a solution of silver nitrate. This\r\n       hyponitrite is insoluble in cold acetic acid, and decomposes when\r\n       heated, with the evolution of nitrous oxide. If rapidly heated it\r\n       decomposes with an explosion. It is dissolved unchanged by weak\r\n       mineral acids, whilst the stronger acids (for example, sulphuric\r\n       and hydrochloric acids) decompose it, with the evolution of\r\n       nitrogen, nitric and nitrous acids remaining in solution. Among\r\n       the other salts of hyponitrous acid, HNO, the salts of lead,\r\n       copper, and mercury are insoluble in water. Judging by the bond\r\n       between hyponitrous acid and the other compounds of nitrogen,\r\n       there is reason for thinking that its formula should he doubled,\r\n       N_{2}H_{2}O_{2}. For instance, Thoune (1893) on gradually\r\n       oxidising hydroxylamine, NH_{2}(OH), into nitrous acid, NO(OH)\r\n       (Note 25), by means of an alkaline solution of KMnO_{4}, first\r\n       obtained hyponitrous acid, N_{2}H_{2}O_{2}, and then a peculiar\r\n       intermediate acid, N_{2}H_{2}O_{3}, which, by further oxidation,\r\n       gave nitrous acid. On the other hand, Wislicenus (1893) showed\r\n       that in the action of the sulphuric acid salt of hydroxylamine\r\n       upon nitrite of sodium, there is formed, besides, nitrous\r\n       oxide (according to V. Meyer, NH_{3}O,H_{2}SO_{4} + NaNO_{2} =\r\n       NaHSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O + N_{2}O), a small amount of hyponitrous\r\n       acid which may be precipitated in the form of the silver salt;\r\n       and this reaction is most simply expressed by taking the doubled\r\n       formula of hyponitrous acid, NH_{2}(OH) + NO(OH) = H_{2}O +\r\n       N_{2}H_{2}O_{2}. The best argument in favour of the doubled\r\n       formula is the property possessed by hyponitrous acid of forming\r\n       acid salts, HNaN_{2}O_{2} (Zorn).\r\n\r\n       According to Thoune, the following are the properties of\r\n       hyponitrous acid. When liberated from the dry silver salt by\r\n       the action of dry sulphuretted hydrogen, hyponitrous acid is\r\n       unstable, and easily explodes even at low temperatures. But\r\n       when dissolved in water (having been formed by the action of\r\n       hydrochloric acid upon the silver salt), it is stable even\r\n       when boiled with dilute acids and alkalis. The solution is\r\n       colourless and has a strongly acid reaction. In the course of\r\n       time, however, the aqueous solution also decomposes into nitrous\r\n       oxide and water. The complete oxidation by permanganate of potash\r\n       proceeds according to the following equation: 5H_{2}N_{2}O_{2} +\r\n       8KMnO_{4} + 12H_{2}SO_{4} = 10HNO_{3} + 4K_{2}SO_{4} + 8MnSO_{4}\r\n       + 12H_{2}O. In an alkaline solution, KMnO_{4} only oxidises\r\n       hyponitrous acid into nitrous and not into nitric acid. Nitrous\r\n       acid has a decomposing action upon hyponitrous acid, and if\r\n       the aqueous solutions of the two acids be mixed together they\r\n       immediately give off oxides of nitrogen. Hyponitrous acid does\r\n       not liberate CO_{2} from its salts, but on the other hand it is\r\n       not displaced by CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [68] It is remarkable that electro-deposited copper powder gives\r\n       nitrous oxide with a 10 p.c. solution of nitric acid, whilst\r\n       ordinary copper gives nitric oxide. It is here evident that\r\n       the physical and mechanical structure of the substance affects\r\n       the course of the reaction--that is to say, it is a case of\r\n       contact-action.\r\n\r\n  [69] This decomposition is accompanied by the evolution of about 25,000\r\n       calories per molecular quantity, NH_{4}NO_{3}, and therefore\r\n       takes place with ease, and sometimes with an explosion.\r\n\r\n  [70] In order to remove any nitric oxide that might be present, the\r\n       gas obtained is passed through a solution of ferrous sulphate. As\r\n       nitrous oxide is very soluble in cold water (at 0°, 100 volumes\r\n       of water dissolve 130 volumes of N_{2}O; at 20°, 67 volumes),\r\n       it must be collected over warm water. The nitrous oxide is much\r\n       more soluble than nitric oxide, which is in agreement with the\r\n       fact that nitrous oxide is much more easily liquefied than nitric\r\n       oxide. Villard obtained a crystallohydrate, N_{2}O,6H_{2}O, which\r\n       was tolerably stable at 0°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Natterer's apparatus for the preparation of\r\nliquid nitrous oxide and carbonic anhydride. The gas first passes though\r\nthe vessel V, for drying, and then into the pump (a section of the upper\r\npart of the apparatus is given on the left). The piston _t_ of the\r\nforce pump is moved by the crank E and fly-wheel turned by hand. The\r\ngas is pumped into the iron chamber A, where it is liquefied. The valve\r\nS allows the gas to enter A, but not to escape from it. The chamber\r\nand pump are cooled by the jacket B, filled with ice. When the gas is\r\nliquefied the vessel A is unscrewed from the pump, and the liquid may be\r\npoured from it by inverting it and unscrewing the valve _v_, when the\r\nliquid runs out of the tube _x_.]\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide is not a permanent gas (absolute boiling point +36°); it\r\nis easily liquefied by the action of cold under a high pressure; at\r\n15° it may be liquefied by a pressure of about 40 atmospheres. This\r\ngas is usually liquefied by means of the force pump[71] shown in fig.\r\n51. As it is liquefied with comparative ease, and as the cold produced\r\nby its vaporisation is very considerable,[72] it (as also liquid\r\ncarbonic anhydride) is often employed in investigations requiring a low\r\ntemperature. Nitrous oxide forms a very mobile, colourless liquid, which\r\nacts on the skin, and is incapable in a cold state of oxidising either\r\nmetallic potassium, phosphorus, or carbon; its specific gravity is\r\nslightly less than that of water (0° = 0·910, 10° = 0·856, 35° = 0·60,\r\n39° = 0·45, Villard, 1894). When evaporated under the receiver of an\r\nair-pump, the temperature falls to -100°, and the liquid solidifies into\r\na snow-like mass, and partially forms transparent crystals. Both these\r\nsubstances are solid nitrous oxide. Mercury is immediately solidified in\r\ncontact with evaporating liquid nitrous oxide.[73]\r\n\r\n  [71] Faraday obtained liquid nitrous oxide by the same method as liquid\r\n       ammonia, by beating dry ammonium nitrate in a closed bent\r\n       tube, one arm of which was immersed in a freezing mixture. In\r\n       this case two layers of liquid are obtained at the cooled end,\r\n       a lower layer of water and an upper layer of nitrous oxide.\r\n       This experiment should be conducted with great care, as the\r\n       pressure of the nitrous oxide in a liquid state is considerable,\r\n       namely (according to Regnault), at +10° = 45 atmospheres, at\r\n       0° = 36 atmospheres, at -10° = 29 atmospheres, and at -20° = 23\r\n       atmospheres. It boils at -92°, and the pressure is then therefore\r\n       = 1 atmosphere (_see_ Chapter II., Note 27).\r\n\r\n  [72] Liquid nitrous oxide, in vaporising at the same pressure as liquid\r\n       carbonic anhydride, gives rise to almost equal or even slightly\r\n       lower temperatures. Thus at a pressure of 25 mm. carbonic\r\n       anhydride gives a temperature as low as -115°, and nitrous oxide\r\n       of -125° (Dewar). The similarity of these properties and even of\r\n       the absolute boiling point (CO_{2} + 32°, N_{2}O +36°) is all\r\n       the more remarkable because these gases have the same molecular\r\n       weight = 44 (Chapter VII.)\r\n\r\n  [73] A very characteristic experiment of simultaneous combustion and\r\n       intense cold may be performed by means of liquid nitrous oxide;\r\n       if liquid nitrous oxide be poured into a test tube containing\r\n       some mercury the mercury will solidify, and if a piece of red-hot\r\n       charcoal be thrown upon the surface of the nitrous oxide it\r\n       will continue to burn very brilliantly, giving rise to a high\r\n       temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen introduced into the respiratory organs (and consequently into the\r\nblood also) nitrous oxide produces a peculiar kind of intoxication\r\naccompanied by spasmodic movements, and hence this gas, discovered by\r\nPriestley in 1776, received the name of 'laughing gas.' On a prolonged\r\nrespiration it produces a state of insensibility (it is an anæsthetic\r\nlike chloroform), and is therefore employed in dental and surgical\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide is easily decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen by the\r\naction of heat, or a series of electric sparks; and this explains why a\r\nnumber of substances which cannot burn in nitric oxide do so with great\r\nease in nitrous oxide. In fact, when nitric oxide gives some oxygen on\r\ndecomposition, this oxygen immediately unites with a fresh portion of\r\nthe gas to form nitric peroxide, whilst nitrous oxide does not possess\r\nthis capacity for further combination with oxygen.[74] A mixture of\r\nnitrous oxide with hydrogen explodes like detonating gas, gaseous\r\nnitrogen being formed, N_{2}O + H_{2} = H_{2}O + N_{2}. The volume\r\nof the remaining nitrogen is equal to the original volume of nitrous\r\noxide, and is equal to the volume of hydrogen entering into combination\r\nwith the oxygen; hence in this reaction equal volumes of nitrogen\r\nand hydrogen replace each other. Nitrous oxide is also very easily\r\ndecomposed by red-hot metals; and sulphur, phosphorus, and charcoal\r\nburn in it, although not so brilliantly as in oxygen. A substance in\r\nburning in nitrous oxide evolves more heat than an equal quantity\r\nburning in oxygen; which most clearly shows that in the formation of\r\nnitrous oxide by the combination of nitrogen with oxygen there was not\r\nan evolution but an absorption of heat, there being no other source for\r\nthe excess of heat in the combustion of substances in nitrous oxide\r\n(_see_ Note 29). If a given volume of nitrous oxide be decomposed by\r\na metal--for instance, sodium--then there remains, after cooling and\r\ntotal decomposition, a volume of nitrogen, exactly equal to that of the\r\nnitrous oxide taken; consequently the oxygen is, so to say, distributed\r\nbetween the atoms of nitrogen without producing an increase in the\r\nvolume of the nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  [74] In the following chapter we shall consider the volumetric\r\n       composition of the oxides of nitrogen. It explains the difference\r\n       between nitric and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is formed with\r\n       a diminution of volumes (contraction), nitric oxide without\r\n       contraction, its volume being equal to the sum of the volumes of\r\n       the nitrogen and oxygen of which it is composed. By oxidation, if\r\n       it could be directly accomplished, two volumes of nitrous oxide\r\n       and one volume of oxygen would not give three but four volumes\r\n       of nitric oxide. These facts must be taken into consideration in\r\n       comparing the calorific equivalents of formation, the capacity\r\n       for supporting combustion, and other properties of nitrous and\r\n       nitric oxides, N_{2}O and NO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    MOLECULES AND ATOMS. THE LAWS OF GAY-LUSSAC AND AVOGADRO-GERHARDT\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen combines with oxygen in the proportion of two volumes to one.\r\nThe composition by volume of nitrous oxide is exactly similar--it\r\nis composed of two volumes of nitrogen and one volume of oxygen. By\r\ndecomposing ammonia by the action of an electric spark it is easy to\r\nprove that it contains one volume of nitrogen to three volumes of\r\nhydrogen. So, similarly, it is found, whenever a compound is decomposed\r\nand the volumes of the gases proceeding from it are measured, that\r\nthe volumes of the gases or vapours entering into combination are in\r\na very simple proportion to one another. With water, nitrous oxide,\r\n&c., this may be proved by direct observation; but in the majority of\r\ncases, and especially with substances which, although volatile--that is,\r\ncapable of passing into a gaseous (or vaporous) state--are liquid at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, such a direct method of observation presents\r\nmany difficulties. But, then, if the densities of the vapours and gases\r\nbe known, the same simplicity in their ratio is shown by calculation.\r\nThe volume of a substance is proportional to its weight, and inversely\r\nproportional to its density, and therefore by dividing the amount by\r\nweight of each substance entering into the composition of a compound by\r\nits density in the gaseous or vaporous state we shall obtain factors\r\nwhich will be in the same proportion as the volumes of the substances\r\nentering into the composition of the compound.[1] So, for example,\r\nwater contains eight parts by weight of oxygen to one part by weight\r\nof hydrogen, and their densities are 16 and 1, consequently their\r\nvolumes (or the above-mentioned factors) are 1 and 1/2, and therefore\r\nit is seen without direct experiment that water contains two volumes of\r\nhydrogen for every one volume of oxygen. So also, knowing that nitric\r\noxide contains fourteen parts of nitrogen and sixteen parts of oxygen,\r\nand knowing that the specific gravities of these last two gases are\r\nfourteen and sixteen, we find that the volumes in which nitrogen and\r\noxygen combine for the formation of nitric oxide are in the proportion\r\nof 1 : 1. We will cite another example. In the last chapter we saw that\r\nthe density of NO_{2} only becomes constant and equal to twenty-three\r\n(referred to hydrogen) above 135°, and as a matter of fact a method\r\nof direct observation of the volumetric composition of this substance\r\nwould be very difficult at so high a temperature. But it may be easily\r\ncalculated. NO_{2}, as is seen from its formula and analysis, contains\r\nthirty-two parts by weight of oxygen to fourteen parts by weight of\r\nnitrogen, forming forty-six parts by weight of NO_{2}, and knowing the\r\ndensities of these gases we find that one volume of nitrogen with two\r\nvolumes of oxygen gives two volumes of nitrogen peroxide. Therefore,\r\nknowing the amounts by weight of the substances participating in a\r\nreaction or forming a given substance, and knowing the density of the\r\ngas or vapour,[2] the volumetric relations of the substances acting in\r\na reaction or entering into the composition of a compound, may be also\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n  [1] If the weight be indicated by P, the density by D, and the volume\r\n      by V, then\r\n\r\n                               P/D = _K_V\r\n\r\n      where _K_ is a coefficient depending on the system of the\r\n      expressions P, D, and V. If D be the weight of a cubic measure\r\n      of a substance referred to the weight of the same measure of\r\n      water--if, as in the metrical system (Chapter I., Note 9), the\r\n      cubic measure of one part by weight of water be taken as a unit\r\n      of volume--then _K_ = 1. But, whatever it be, it is cancelled in\r\n      dealing with the comparison of volumes, because comparative and\r\n      not absolute measures of volumes are taken. In this chapter, as\r\n      throughout the book, the weight P is given in grams in dealing\r\n      with absolute weights; and if comparative, as in the expression\r\n      of chemical composition, then the weight of an atom is taken as\r\n      unity. The density of gases, D, is also taken in reference to the\r\n      density of hydrogen, and the volume V in metrical units (cubic\r\n      centimetres), if it be a matter of absolute magnitudes of volumes,\r\n      and if it be a matter of chemical transformations--that is, of\r\n      relative volumes--then the volume of an atom of hydrogen, or of\r\n      one part by weight of hydrogen, is taken as unity, and all volumes\r\n      are expressed according to these units.\r\n\r\n  [2] As the volumetric relations of vapours and gases, next to the\r\n      relations of substances by weight, form the most important\r\n      province of chemistry, and a most important means for the\r\n      attainment of chemical conclusions, and inasmuch as these\r\n      volumetric relations are determined by the densities of gases and\r\n      vapours, necessarily the methods of determining the densities of\r\n      vapours (and also of gases) are important factors in chemical\r\n      research. These methods are described in detail in works on\r\n      physics and physical and analytical chemistry, and therefore we\r\n      here only touch on the general principles of the subject.\r\n\r\n      If we know the weight _p_ and volume _v_, occupied by the vapour\r\n      of a given substance at a temperature _t_ and pressure _h_, then\r\n      its density may be directly obtained by dividing _p_ by the weight\r\n      of a volume _v_ of hydrogen (if the density be expressed according\r\n      to hydrogen, _see_ Chapter II., Note 23) at _t_ and _h_. Hence,\r\n      the methods of determining the density of vapours and gases are\r\n      based on the determination of _p_, _v_, _t_, and _h_. The two\r\n      last data (the temperature _t_ and pressure _h_) are given by the\r\n      thermometer and barometer and the heights of mercury or other\r\n      liquid confining the gas, and therefore do not require further\r\n      explanation. It need only be remarked that: (1) In the case of\r\n      easily volatile liquids there is no difficulty in procuring a\r\n      bath with a constant temperature, but that it is nevertheless\r\n      best (especially considering the inaccuracy of thermometers) to\r\n      have a medium of absolutely constant temperature, and therefore\r\n      to take either a bath in which some substance is melting--such\r\n      as melting ice at 0° or crystals of sodium acetate, melting at\r\n      +56°--or, as is more generally practised, to place the vessel\r\n      containing the substance to be experimented with in the vapour\r\n      of a liquid boiling at a definite temperature, and knowing the\r\n      pressure under which it is boiling, to determine the temperature\r\n      of the vapour. For this purpose the boiling points of water at\r\n      different pressures are given in Chapter I., Note 11, and the\r\n      boiling points of certain easily procurable liquids at various\r\n      pressures are given in Chapter II., Note 27. (2) With respect to\r\n      temperatures above 300° (below which mercurial thermometers may\r\n      be conveniently employed), they are most simply obtained constant\r\n      (to give time for the weight and volume of a substance being\r\n      observed in a given space, and to allow that space to attain the\r\n      calculated temperature _t_) by means of substances boiling at a\r\n      high temperature. Thus, for instance, at the ordinary atmospheric\r\n      pressure the temperature _t_ of the vapour of sulphur is about\r\n      445°, of phosphorus pentasulphide 518°, of tin chloride 606°,\r\n      of cadmium 770°, of zinc 930° (according to Violle and others),\r\n      or 1040° (according to Deville), &c. (3) The indications of the\r\n      hydrogen thermometer must be considered as the most exact (but\r\n      as hydrogen diffuses through incandescent platinum, nitrogen is\r\n      usually employed). (4) The temperature of the vapours used as\r\n      the bath should in every case be several degrees higher than the\r\n      boiling point of the liquid whose density is to be determined,\r\n      in order that no portion should remain in a liquid state. But\r\n      even in this case, as is seen from the example of nitric peroxide\r\n      (Chapter VI.), the vapour density does not always remain constant\r\n      with a change of _t_, as it should were the law of the expansion\r\n      of gases and vapours absolutely exact (Chapter II., Note 26). If\r\n      variations of a chemical and physical nature similar to that which\r\n      we saw in nitric peroxide take place in the vapours, the main\r\n      interest is centred in _constant_ densities, which do not vary\r\n      with _t_, and therefore the possible effect of _t_ on the density\r\n      must always be kept in mind in having recourse to this means\r\n      of investigation. (5) Usually, for the sake of convenience of\r\n      observation, the vapour density is determined at the atmospheric\r\n      pressure which is read on the barometer; but in the case of\r\n      substances which are volatilised with difficulty, and also of\r\n      substances which decompose, or, in general, vary at temperatures\r\n      near their boiling points, it is best or even indispensable to\r\n      conduct the determination at low pressures, whilst for substances\r\n      which decompose at low pressures the observations have to be\r\n      conducted under a more or less considerably increased pressure.\r\n      (6) In many cases it is convenient to determine the vapour density\r\n      of a substance in admixture with other gases, and consequently\r\n      under the partial pressure, which may be calculated from the\r\n      volume of the mixture and that of the intermixed gas (_see_\r\n      Chapter I., Note 1). This method is especially important for\r\n      substances which are easily decomposable, because, as shown by the\r\n      phenomena of dissociation, a substance is able to remain unchanged\r\n      in the atmosphere of one of its products of decomposition. Thus,\r\n      Wurtz determined the density of phosphoric chloride, PCl_{5},\r\n      in admixture with the vapour of phosphorous chloride, PCl_{3}.\r\n      (7) It is evident, from the example of nitric peroxide, that a\r\n      change of pressure may alter the density and aid decomposition,\r\n      and therefore identical results are sometimes obtained (if the\r\n      density be variable) by raising _t_ and lowering _h_; but if the\r\n      density does not vary under these variable conditions (at least,\r\n      to an extent appreciably exceeding the limits of experimental\r\n      error), then this _constant_ density indicates the _gaseous_\r\n      and _invariable_ state of a substance. The laws hereafter laid\r\n      down refer only to such vapour densities. But the majority of\r\n      volatile substances show such a constant density at a certain\r\n      degree above their boiling points up to the starting point of\r\n      decomposition. Thus, the density of aqueous vapour does not vary\r\n      for _t_ between the ordinary temperature and 1000° (there are no\r\n      trustworthy determinations beyond this) and for pressures varying\r\n      from fractions of an atmosphere up to several atmospheres. If,\r\n      however, the density does vary considerably with a variation of\r\n      _h_ and _t_, the fact may serve as a guide for the investigation\r\n      of the chemical changes which are undergone by the substance in a\r\n      state of vapour, or at least as an indication of a deviation from\r\n      the laws of Boyle, Mariotte, and Gay-Lussac (for the expansion of\r\n      gases with _t_). In certain cases the separation of one form of\r\n      deviation from the other may be explained by special hypotheses.\r\n\r\n      With respect to the means of determining _p_ and _v_, with a\r\n      view to finding the vapour density, we may distinguish three\r\n      chief methods: (_a_) by weight, by ascertaining the weight of\r\n      a definite volume of vapour; (_b_) by volume, by measuring the\r\n      volume occupied by the vapour of a definite weight of a substance;\r\n      and (_c_) by displacement. The last-mentioned is essentially\r\n      volumetric, because a known weight of a substance is taken, and\r\n      the volume of the air displaced by the vapour at a given _t_ and\r\n      _h_ is determined.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Apparatus for determining the vapour\r\n      density by Dumas' method. A small quantity of the liquid whose\r\n      vapour density is to be determined is placed in the glass\r\n      globe, and heated in a water or oil bath to a temperature above\r\n      the boiling point of the liquid. When all the liquid has been\r\n      converted into vapour and has displaced all the air from the\r\n      globe, the latter is sealed up and weighed. The capacity of the\r\n      globe is then measured, and in this manner the volume occupied by\r\n      a known weight of vapour at a known temperature is determined.]\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Deville and Troost's apparatus for\r\n      determining the vapour densities, according to Dumas' method, of\r\n      substances which boil at high temperatures. A porcelain globe\r\n      containing the substance whose vapour density is to be determined\r\n      is heated in the vapour of mercury (350°), sulphur (410°), cadmium\r\n      (850°), or zinc (1,040°). The globe is sealed up in an oxyhydrogen\r\n      flame.]\r\n\r\n      The method by weight (_a_) is the most trustworthy and\r\n      historically important. _Dumas' method_ is typical. An ordinary\r\n      spherical glass or porcelain vessel, like those shown respectively\r\n      in figs. 52 and 53, is taken, and an excess of the substance to be\r\n      experimented upon is introduced into it. The vessel is heated to a\r\n      temperature _t_ higher than the boiling point of the liquid: this\r\n      gives a vapour which displaces the air, and fills the spherical\r\n      space. When the air and vapour cease escaping from the sphere, it\r\n      is fused up or closed by some means; and when cool, the weight\r\n      of the vapour remaining in the sphere is determined (either by\r\n      direct weighing of the vessel with the vapour and introducing the\r\n      necessary corrections for the weight of the air and of the vapour\r\n      itself, or the weight of the volatilised substance is determined\r\n      by chemical methods), and the volume of the vapour at _t_ and the\r\n      barometric pressure _h_ are then calculated.\r\n\r\n      _The volumetric method_ (_b_) originally employed by Gay-Lussac\r\n      and then modified by Hofmann and others is based on the principle\r\n      that a weighed quantity of the liquid to be experimented with\r\n      (placed in a small closed vessel, which is sometimes fused up\r\n      before weighing, and, if quite full of the liquid, breaks when\r\n      heated in a vacuum) is introduced into a graduated cylinder heated\r\n      to _t_, or simply into a Torricellian vacuum, as shown in fig. 54,\r\n      and the number of volumes occupied by the vapour noted when the\r\n      space holding it is heated to the desired temperature _t_.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Hofmann's apparatus for determining\r\n      vapour densities.

Steam, or the vapour of amyl alcohol, &c., is\r\n      passed through the outer tube, and heats the internal tube to the\r\n      temperature _t_, at which the volume of vapour is measured.]\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Victor Meyer's apparatus for determining\r\n      vapour densities. The tube _b_ is heated in the vapour of a liquid\r\n      of constant boiling point. A glass tube, containing the liquid\r\n      to be experimented upon, is caused to fall from _d_. The air\r\n      displaced is collected in the cylinder _e_, in the trough _f_.]\r\n\r\n      _The method of displacement_ (_c_) proposed by Victor Meyer\r\n      is based on the fact that a space _b_ is heated to a constant\r\n      temperature _t_ (by the surrounding vapours of a liquid of\r\n      constant boiling point), and the air (or other gas enclosed in\r\n      this space) is allowed to attain this temperature, and when it\r\n      has done so a glass bulb containing a weighed quantity of the\r\n      substance to be experimented with is dropped into the space. The\r\n      substance is immediately converted into vapour, and displaces\r\n      the air into the graduated cylinder _e_. The amount of this air\r\n      is calculated from its volume, and hence the volume at _t_, and\r\n      therefore also the volume occupied by the vapour, is found. The\r\n      general arrangement of the apparatus is given in fig. 55.\r\n\r\nSuch an investigation (either direct, or by calculation from the\r\ndensities and composition) of every chemical reaction, resulting in the\r\nformation of definite chemical compounds, shows that the volumes of\r\nthe reacting substances in a gaseous or vaporous state are either equal\r\nor are in simple multiple proportion.[3] This forms the _first law_\r\nof those discovered by _Gay-Lussac_. It may be formulated as follows:\r\n_The amounts of substances entering into chemical reaction occupy under\r\nsimilar physical conditions, in a gaseous or vaporous state, equal or\r\nsimple multiple volumes._ This law refers not only to elements, but\r\nalso to compounds entering into mutual chemical combination; thus, for\r\nexample, one volume of ammonia gas combines with one volume of hydrogen\r\nchloride. For in the formation of sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, there enter\r\ninto reaction 17 parts by weight of ammonia, NH_{3}, which is 8·5 times\r\ndenser than hydrogen, and 36·5 parts by weight of hydrogen chloride,\r\nwhose vapour density is 18·25 times that of hydrogen, as has been\r\nproved by direct experiment. By dividing the weights by the respective\r\ndensities we find that the volume of ammonia, NH_{3}, is equal to two,\r\nand so also the volume of hydrogen chloride. Hence the volumes of the\r\ncompounds which here combine together are equal to each other. Taking\r\ninto consideration that the law of Gay-Lussac holds good, not only for\r\nelements, but also for compounds, it should be expressed as follows:\r\n_Substances interact with one another in commensurable volumes of their\r\nvapours._[4]\r\n\r\n  [3] Vapours and gases, as already explained in the second chapter, are\r\n      subject to the same laws, which are, however, only approximate. It\r\n      is evident that for the deduction of the laws which will presently\r\n      be enunciated it is only possible to take into consideration\r\n      a perfect gaseous state (far removed from the liquid state)\r\n      and chemical invariability in which the _vapour density is\r\n      constant_--that is, the volume of a given gas or vapour varies\r\n      like a volume of hydrogen, air, or other gas, with the pressure\r\n      and temperature.\r\n\r\n      It is necessary to make this statement in order that it may be\r\n      clearly seen that the laws of gaseous volumes, which we shall\r\n      describe presently, are in the most intimate connection with the\r\n      laws of the variations of volumes with pressure and temperature.\r\n      And as these latter laws (Chapter II.) are not infallible, but\r\n      only approximately exact, the same, therefore, applies to the laws\r\n      about to be described. And as it is possible to find more exact\r\n      laws (a second approximation) for the variation of _v_ with _p_\r\n      and _t_ (for example, van der Waals' formula, Chapter II., Note\r\n      33), so also a more exact expression of the relation between the\r\n      composition and the density of vapours and gases is also possible.\r\n      But to prevent any doubt arising at the very beginning as to the\r\n      breadth and general application of the laws of volumes, it will be\r\n      sufficient to mention that the density of such gases as oxygen,\r\n      nitrogen, and carbonic anhydride is already known to _remain\r\n      constant_ (within the limits of experimental error) between the\r\n      ordinary temperature and a white heat; whilst, judging from what\r\n      is said in my work on the 'Tension of Gases' (vol. i. p. 9),\r\n      it may be said that, as regards pressure, the relative density\r\n      remains very constant, even when the deviations from Mariotte's\r\n      law are very considerable. However, in this respect the number of\r\n      data is as yet too small to arrive at an exact conclusion.\r\n\r\n  [4] We must recollect that this law is only approximate, like Boyle\r\n      and Mariotte's law, and that, therefore, like the latter, a more\r\n      exact expression may be found for the exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe law of combining volumes and the law of multiple proportion were\r\ndiscovered independently of each other--the one in France by Gay-Lussac,\r\nthe other in England by Dalton--almost simultaneously. In the language\r\nof the atomic hypothesis it may be said that atomic quantities of\r\nelements occupy equal or multiple volumes.\r\n\r\nThe first law of Gay-Lussac expresses the relation between the volumes\r\nof the component parts of a compound. Let us now consider the relation\r\nexisting between the volumes of the component parts and of the compounds\r\nwhich proceed from them. This may sometimes be determined by direct\r\nobservation. Thus the volume occupied by water, formed by two volumes\r\nof hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, may be determined by the aid of\r\nthe apparatus shown in fig. 56. The long glass tube is closed at the\r\ntop and open at the bottom, which is immersed in a cylinder containing\r\nmercury. The closed end is furnished with wires like a eudiometer. The\r\ntube is filled with mercury, and then a certain volume of detonating gas\r\nis introduced. This gas is obtained from the decomposition of water,\r\nand therefore in every three volumes contains two volumes of hydrogen\r\nand one volume of oxygen. The tube is surrounded by a second and wider\r\nglass tube, and the vapour of a substance boiling above 100°--that is,\r\nwhose boiling point is higher than that of water--is passed through\r\nthe annular space between them. Amyl alcohol, whose boiling point is\r\n132°, may be taken for this purpose. The amyl alcohol is boiled in the\r\nvessel to the right hand and its vapour passed between the walls of the\r\ntwo tubes. In the case of amyl alcohol the outer glass tube should be\r\nconnected with a condenser to prevent the escape into the air of the\r\nunpleasant-smelling vapour. The detonating gas is thus heated up to a\r\ntemperature of 132°. When its volume becomes constant it is measured,\r\nthe height of the column of mercury in the tube above the level of the\r\nmercury in the cylinder being noted. Let this volume equal _v_; it will\r\ntherefore contain 1/3 _v_ of oxygen and 2/3 _v_ of hydrogen. The current\r\nof vapour is then stopped, and the gas exploded; water is formed, which\r\ncondenses into a liquid. The volume occupied by the vapour of the water\r\nformed has now to be determined. For this purpose the vapour of the amyl\r\nalcohol is again passed between the tubes, and thus the whole of the\r\nwater formed is converted into vapour at the same temperature as that at\r\nwhich the detonating gas was measured; and the cylinder of mercury being\r\nraised until the column of mercury in the tube stands at the same height\r\nabove the surface of the mercury in the cylinder as it did before the\r\nexplosion, it is found that the volume of the water formed is equal to\r\n2/3 _v_--that is, it is equal to the volume of the hydrogen contained\r\nin it. Consequently the volumetric composition of water is expressed in\r\nthe following terms: Two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of\r\noxygen to form two volumes of aqueous vapour. For substances which are\r\ngaseous at the ordinary temperature, this direct method of observation\r\nis sometimes very easily conducted; for instance, with ammonia, nitric\r\nand nitrous oxides. Thus to determine the composition by volume of\r\nnitrous oxide, the above-described apparatus may be employed. Nitrous\r\noxide is introduced into the tube, and after measuring its volume\r\nelectric sparks are passed through the gas; it is then found that two\r\nvolumes of nitrous oxide have given three volumes of gases--namely,\r\ntwo volumes of nitrogen and one volume of oxygen. Consequently the\r\ncomposition of nitrous oxide is similar to that of water; two volumes of\r\nnitrogen and one volume of oxygen give two volumes of nitrous oxide. By\r\ndecomposing ammonia it is found to be composed in such a manner that two\r\nvolumes give one volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen; also\r\ntwo volumes of nitric oxide are formed by the union of one volume of\r\noxygen with one volume of nitrogen. The same relations may be proved by\r\ncalculation from the vapour densities, as was described above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Apparatus for demonstrating the volume occupied\r\nby the steam formed from the explosion of detonating gas.]\r\n\r\nComparisons of various results made by the aid of direct observations or\r\ncalculation, an example of which has just been cited, led Gay-Lussac to\r\nthe conclusion that _the volume of a compound in a gaseous or vaporous\r\nstate is always in simple multiple proportion to the volume of each of\r\nthe component parts of which it is formed_ (and consequently to the\r\nsum of the volumes of the elements of which it is formed). This is the\r\n_second law of Gay-Lussac_; it extends the simplicity of the volumetric\r\nrelations to compounds, and is of the same nature as that presented\r\nby the elements entering into mutual combination. Hence not only the\r\nsubstances forming a given compound, but also the substances formed,\r\nexhibit a simple relation of volume when measured as vapour or gas.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] This second law of volumes may be considered as a consequence of the\r\n      first law. The first law requires simple ratios between the\r\n      volumes of the combining substances _A_ and _B_. A substance _AB_\r\n      is produced by their combination. It may, according to the law\r\n      of multiple proportion, combine, not only with substances _C_,\r\n      _D_, &c., but also with _A_ and with _B_. In this new combination\r\n      the volume of _AB_, combining with the volume of _A_, should be\r\n      in simple multiple proportion with the volume of _A_; hence the\r\n      volume of the compound _AB_ is in simple proportion to the volume\r\n      of its component parts. Therefore only one law of volumes need be\r\n      accepted. We shall afterwards see that there is a third law of\r\n      volumes embracing also the two first laws.\r\n\r\nWhen a compound is formed from two or more components, there may\r\nor may not be a contraction; the volume of the reacting substances\r\nis in this case either equal to or greater than the volume of the\r\nresultant compound. The reverse is naturally observed in the case of\r\ndecompositions, when from one substance there are produced several of\r\nsimpler nature. Therefore in the future we shall term _combination_ a\r\nreaction in which a contraction is observed--that is, a diminution in\r\nthe volume of the component bodies in a state of vapour or gas; and we\r\nshall term _decomposition_ a reaction in which an expansion is produced;\r\nwhile those reactions in which the volumes in a gaseous or vaporous\r\nstate remain constant (the volumes being naturally compared at the same\r\ntemperature and pressure) we shall term reactions of _substitution_ or\r\nof double decomposition. Thus the transition of oxygen into ozone is a\r\nreaction of combination, the formation of nitrous oxide from oxygen and\r\nnitrogen will also be a combination, the formation of nitric oxide from\r\nthe same will be a reaction of substitution, the action of oxygen on\r\nnitric oxide a combination, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe degree of contraction produced in the formation of chemical\r\ncompounds not unfrequently leads to the possibility of distinguishing\r\nthe degree of change which takes place in the chemical character of the\r\ncomponents when combined. In those cases in which a contraction occurs,\r\nthe properties of the resultant compound are very different from the\r\nproperties of the substances of which it is composed. Thus ammonia bears\r\nno resemblance in its physical or chemical properties to the elements\r\nfrom which it is derived; a contraction takes place in a state of\r\nvapour, indicating a proximation of the elements--the distance between\r\nthe atoms is diminished, and from gaseous substances there is formed a\r\nliquid substance, or at any rate one which is easily liquefied. For this\r\nreason nitrous oxide formed by the condensation of two permanent gases\r\nis a substance which is somewhat easily converted into a liquid; again,\r\nnitric acid, which is formed from elements which are permanent gases,\r\nis a liquid, whilst, on the contrary, nitric oxide, which is formed\r\nwithout contraction and is decomposed without expansion, remains a gas\r\nwhich is as difficult to liquefy as nitrogen and oxygen. In order to\r\nobtain a still more complete idea of the dependence of the properties\r\nof a compound on the properties of the component substances, it is\r\nfurther necessary to know the quantity of heat which is developed in the\r\nformation of the compound. If this quantity be large--as, for example,\r\nin the formation of water--then the amount of energy in the resultant\r\ncompound will be considerably less than the energy of the elements\r\nentering into its composition; whilst, on the contrary, if the amount of\r\nheat evolved in the formation of a compound be small, or if there even\r\nbe an absorption of heat, as in the formation of nitrous oxide, then the\r\nenergy of the elements is not destroyed, or is only altered to a slight\r\nextent; hence, notwithstanding the contraction (compression) involved in\r\nits formation, nitrous oxide supports combustion.\r\n\r\nThe preceding laws were deduced from purely experimental and empirical\r\ndata and as such evoke further consequences, as the law of multiple\r\nproportions gave rise to the atomic theory and the law of equivalents\r\n(Chapter IV.) In view of the atomic conception of the constitution of\r\nsubstances, the question naturally arises as to what, then, are the\r\nrelative volumes proper to those physically indivisible molecules which\r\nchemically react on each other and consist of the atoms of elements.\r\nThe simplest possible hypothesis in this respect would be that the\r\nvolumes of the molecules of substances are equal; or, what is the same\r\nthing, to suppose that equal volumes of vapours and gases contain an\r\nequal number of molecules. This proposition was first enunciated by the\r\nItalian savant _Avogadro_ in 1810. It was also admitted by the French\r\nphysico-mathematician _Ampère_ (1815) for the sake of simplifying all\r\nkinds of physico-mathematical conceptions respecting gases. But Avogadro\r\nand Ampère's propositions were not generally received in science\r\nuntil Gerhardt in the forties had applied them to the generalisation\r\nof chemical reactions, and had demonstrated, by aid of a series of\r\nphenomena, that the reactions of substances actually take place with\r\nthe greatest simplicity, and more especially that such reactions take\r\nplace between those quantities of substances which occupy equal volumes,\r\nand until he had stated the hypothesis in an exact manner and deduced\r\nthe consequences that necessarily follow from it. Following Gerhardt,\r\nClausius, in the fifties, placed this hypothesis of the equality of\r\nthe number of molecules in equal volumes of gases and vapours on the\r\nbasis of the kinetic theory of gases. At the present day the hypothesis\r\nof Avogadro and Gerhardt lies at the basis of contemporary physical,\r\nmechanical, and chemical conceptions; the consequences arising from it\r\nhave often been subject to doubt, but in the end have been verified by\r\nthe most diverse methods; and now, when all efforts to refute those\r\nconsequences have proved fruitless, the hypothesis must be considered\r\nas verified,[6] and the _law of Avogadro-Gerhardt_ must be spoken of as\r\nfundamental, and as of great importance for the comprehension of the\r\nphenomena of nature. The law may now be formulated from two points of\r\nview. In the first place, from a physical aspect: _equal volumes of\r\ngases_ (or vapours) at equal temperatures and pressures _contain the\r\nsame number of molecules_--or of particles of matter which are neither\r\nmechanically nor physically divisible--previous to chemical change. In\r\nthe second place, from a chemical aspect, the same law may be expressed\r\nthus: _the quantities of substances entering into chemical reactions\r\noccupy, in a state of vapour, equal volumes_. For our purpose the\r\nchemical aspect is the most important, and therefore, before developing\r\nthe law and its consequences, we will consider the chemical phenomena\r\nfrom which the law is deduced or which it serves to explain.\r\n\r\n  [6] It must not be forgotten that Newton's law of gravity was first a\r\n      hypothesis, but it became a trustworthy, perfect theory, and\r\n      acquired the qualities of a fundamental law owing to the concord\r\n      between its deductions and actual facts. All laws, all theories,\r\n      of natural phenomena, are at first hypotheses. Some are rapidly\r\n      established by their consequences exactly agreeing with facts;\r\n      others only take root by slow degrees; and there are many which\r\n      are destined to be refuted owing to their consequences being found\r\n      to be at variance with facts.\r\n\r\nWhen two isolated substances interact with each other directly and\r\neasily--as, for instance, an alkali and an acid--then it is found that\r\nthe reaction is accomplished between quantities which in a gaseous\r\nstate occupy equal volumes. Thus ammonia, NH_{3}, reacts directly with\r\nhydrochloric acid, HCl, forming sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, and in this\r\ncase the 17 parts by weight of ammonia occupy the same volume as the\r\n36·5 parts by weight of hydrochloric acid.[7] Ethylene, C_{2}H_{4},\r\ncombines with chlorine, Cl_{2}, in only one proportion, forming\r\nethylene dichloride, C_{2}H_{4}Cl_{2}, and this combination proceeds\r\ndirectly and with great facility, the reacting quantities occupying\r\nequal volumes. Chlorine reacts with hydrogen in only one proportion,\r\nforming hydrochloric acid, HCl, and in this case equal volumes interact\r\nwith each other. If an equality of volumes is observed in cases of\r\ncombination, it should be even more frequently encountered in cases\r\nof decomposition, taking place in substances which split up into two\r\nothers. Indeed, acetic acid breaks up into marsh gas, CH_{4}, and\r\ncarbonic anhydride, CO_{2}, and in the proportions in which they\r\nare formed from acetic acid they occupy equal volumes. Also from\r\nphthalic acid, C_{8}H_{6}O_{4}, there may be obtained benzoic acid,\r\nC_{7}H_{6}O_{2}, and carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}, and as all the elements\r\nof phthalic acid enter into the composition of these substances, it\r\nfollows that, although they cannot re-form it by their direct action\r\non each other (the reaction is not reversible), still they form the\r\ndirect products of its decomposition, and they occupy equal volumes.\r\nBut benzoic acid, C_{7}H_{6}O_{2}, is itself composed of benzene,\r\nC_{6}H_{6}, and carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}, which also occupy equal\r\nvolumes.[8] There is an immense number of similar examples among those\r\norganic substances to whose study Gerhardt consecrated his whole life\r\nand work, and he did not allow such facts as these to escape his\r\nattention. Still more frequently in the phenomena of substitution,\r\nwhen two substances react on one another, and two are produced without\r\na change of volume, it is found that the two substances acting on\r\neach other occupy equal volumes as well as each of the two resultant\r\nsubstances. Thus, in general, reactions of substitution take place\r\nbetween volatile acids, HX, and volatile alcohols, R(OH), with the\r\nformation of ethereal salts, RX, and water, H(OH), and the volume of the\r\nvapour of the reacting quantities, HX, R(OH), and RX, is the same as\r\nthat of water H(OH), whose weight, corresponding with the formula, 18,\r\noccupies 2 volumes, if 1 part by weight of hydrogen occupy 1 volume and\r\nthe density of aqueous vapour referred to hydrogen is 9. Such general\r\nexamples, of which there are many,[9] show that the reaction of equal\r\nvolumes forms a chemical phenomenon of frequent occurrence, indicating\r\nthe necessity for acknowledging the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.\r\n\r\n  [7] This is not only seen from the above calculations, but may be proved\r\n      by experiment. A glass tube, divided in the middle by a stopcock,\r\n      is taken and one portion filled with _dry_ hydrogen chloride\r\n      (the dryness of the gases is very necessary, because ammonia\r\n      and hydrogen chloride are both very soluble in water, so that a\r\n      small trace of water may contain a large amount of these gases in\r\n      solution) and the other with dry ammonia, under the atmospheric\r\n      pressure. One orifice (for instance, of that portion which\r\n      contains the ammonia) is firmly closed, and the other is immersed\r\n      under mercury, and the cock is then opened. Solid sal-ammoniac is\r\n      formed, but if the volume of one gas be greater than that of the\r\n      other, some of the first gas will remain. By immersing the tube in\r\n      the mercury in order that the internal pressure shall equal the\r\n      atmospheric pressure, it may easily be shown that the volume of\r\n      the remaining gas is equal to the difference between the volumes\r\n      of the two portions of the tube, and that this remaining gas is\r\n      part of that whose volume was the greater.\r\n\r\n  [8] Let us demonstrate this by figures. From 122 grams of benzoic acid\r\n      there are obtained (_a_) 78 grams of benzene, whose density\r\n      referred to hydrogen = 39, hence the relative volume = 2; and\r\n      (_b_) 44 grams of carbonic anhydride, whose density = 22, and\r\n      hence the volume = 2. It is the same in other cases.\r\n\r\n  [9] A large number of such generalised reactions, showing reaction\r\n      by equal volumes, occur in the case of the hydrocarbon\r\n      derivatives, because many of these compounds are volatile. The\r\n      reactions of alkalis on acids, or anhydrides on water, &c.,\r\n      which are so frequent between mineral substances, present but\r\n      few such examples, because many of these substances are not\r\n      volatile and their vapour densities are unknown. But essentially\r\n      the same is seen in these cases also; for instance, sulphuric\r\n      acid, H_{2}SO_{4}, breaks up into the anhydride, SO_{3}, and\r\n      water, H_{2}O, which exhibit an equality of volumes. Let us take\r\n      another example where three substances combine in equal volumes:\r\n      carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}, ammonia, NH_{3}, and water, H_{2}O\r\n      (the volumes of all are equal to 2), form acid ammonium carbonate,\r\n      (NH_{4})HCO_{3}.\r\n\r\nBut the question arises, What is the relation of volumes if the reaction\r\nof two substances takes place in more than one proportion, according to\r\nthe law of multiple proportions? A definite answer can only be given in\r\ncases which have been very thoroughly studied. Thus chlorine, in acting\r\non marsh gas, CH_{4}, forms four compounds, CH_{3}Cl, CH_{2}Cl_{2},\r\nCHCl_{3}, and CCl_{4}, and it may be established by direct experiment\r\nthat the substance CH_{3}Cl (methylic chloride) precedes the remainder,\r\nand that the latter proceed from it by the further action of chlorine.\r\nAnd this substance, CH_{3}Cl, is formed by the reaction of equal volumes\r\nof marsh gas, CH_{4}, and chlorine, Cl_{2}, according to the equation\r\nCH_{4} + Cl_{2} = CH_{3}Cl + HCl. A great number of similar cases are\r\nmet with amongst organic--that is, carbon--compounds. Gerhardt was led\r\nto the discovery of his law by investigating many such reactions, and by\r\nobserving that in them the reaction of equal volumes precedes all others.\r\n\r\nBut if nitrogen or hydrogen give several compounds with oxygen, the\r\nquestion proposed above cannot be answered with complete clearness,\r\nbecause the successive formations of the different combinations cannot\r\nbe so strictly defined. It may be supposed, but neither definitely\r\naffirmed nor experimentally confirmed, that nitrogen and oxygen\r\nfirst give nitric oxide, NO, and only subsequently the brown vapours\r\nN_{2}O_{3} and NO_{2}. Such a sequence in the combination of nitrogen\r\nwith oxygen can only be supposed on the basis of the fact that NO forms\r\nN_{2}O_{3} and NO_{2} directly with oxygen. If it be admitted that NO\r\n(and not N_{2}O or NO_{2}) be first formed, then this instance would\r\nalso confirm the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, because nitric oxide contains\r\nequal volumes of nitrogen and oxygen. So, also, it may be admitted that,\r\nin the combination of hydrogen with oxygen, hydrogen peroxide is first\r\nformed (equal volumes of hydrogen and oxygen), which is decomposed by\r\nthe heat evolved into water and oxygen. This explains the presence of\r\ntraces of hydrogen peroxide (Chapter IV.) in almost all cases of the\r\ncombustion or oxidation of hydrogenous substances; for it cannot be\r\nsupposed that water is first formed and then the peroxide of hydrogen,\r\nbecause up to now such a reaction has not been observed, whilst the\r\nformation of H_{2}O from H_{2}O_{2} is very easily reproduced.[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] This opinion which I have always held (since the first editions\r\n       of this work), as to the primary origin of hydrogen peroxide\r\n       and of the formation of water by means of its decomposition,\r\n       has in latter days become more generally accepted, thanks more\r\n       especially to the work of Traube. Probably it explains most\r\n       simply the necessity for the presence of traces of water in\r\n       many reactions, as, for instance, in the explosion of carbonic\r\n       oxide with oxygen, and perhaps the theory of the explosion of\r\n       detonating gas itself and of the combustion of hydrogen will\r\n       gain in clearness and truth if we take into consideration the\r\n       preliminary formation of hydrogen peroxide and its decomposition.\r\n       We may here point out the fact that Ettingen (at Dorpat, 1888)\r\n       observed the existence of currents and waves in the explosion of\r\n       detonating gas by taking photographs, which showed the periods of\r\n       combustion and the waves of explosion, which should be taken into\r\n       consideration in the theory of this subject. As the formation of\r\n       H_{2}O_{2} from O_{2} and H_{2} corresponds with a less amount of\r\n       heat than the formation of water from H_{2} and O, it may be that\r\n       the temperature of the flame of detonating gas depends on the\r\n       pre-formation of hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nThus a whole series of phenomena show that the chemical reaction of\r\nsubstances actually takes place, as a rule, between equal volumes,\r\nbut this does not preclude the possibility of the frequent reaction\r\nof unequal volumes, although, in this case, it is often possible to\r\ndiscover a preceding reaction between equal volumes.[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] The possibility of reactions between unequal volumes,\r\n       notwithstanding the general application of the law of\r\n       Avogadro-Gerhardt, may, in addition to what has been said\r\n       above, depend on the fact that the participating substances,\r\n       at the moment of reaction, undergo a preliminary modification,\r\n       decomposition, isomeric (polymeric) transformation, &c. Thus,\r\n       if NO_{2}, seems to proceed from N_{2}O_{4}, if O_{2} is formed\r\n       from O_{3}, and the converse, then it cannot be denied that\r\n       the production of molecules containing only one atom is also\r\n       possible--for instance, of oxygen--as also of higher polymeric\r\n       forms--as the molecule N from N_{2}, or H_{3} from H_{2}. In\r\n       this manner it is obviously possible, by means of a series of\r\n       hypotheses, to explain the cases of the formation of ammonia,\r\n       NH_{3}, from 3 vols. of hydrogen and 1 vol. of nitrogen. But\r\n       it must be observed that perhaps our information in similar\r\n       instances is, as yet, far from being complete. If hydrazine or\r\n       diamide N_{2}H_{4} (Chapter VI. Note 20 bis) is formed and the\r\n       imide N_{2}H_{2} in which 2 vols. of hydrogen are combined with\r\n       2 vols. of nitrogen, then the reaction here perhaps first takes\r\n       place between equal volumes. If it be shown that diamide gives\r\n       nitrogen and ammonia (3N_{2}H_{4} = N_{2} + 4NH_{3}) under the\r\n       action of sparks, heat, or the silent discharge, &c., then it\r\n       will be possible to admit that it is formed before ammonia. And\r\n       perhaps the still less stable imide N_{2}H_{2}, which may also\r\n       decompose with the formation of ammonia, is produced before the\r\n       amide N_{2}H_{4}.\r\n\r\n       I mention this to show that the fact of apparent exceptions\r\n       existing to the law of reactions between equal volumes does not\r\n       prove the impossibility of their being included under the law\r\n       on further study of the subject. Having put forward a certain\r\n       law or hypothesis, consequences must be deduced from it, and\r\n       if by their means clearness and consistency are attained--and\r\n       especially, if by their means that which could not otherwise\r\n       be known can be predicted--then the consequences verify the\r\n       hypothesis. This was the case with the law now under discussion.\r\n       The mere simplicity of the deduction of the weights proper to\r\n       the atoms of the elements, or the mere fact that having admitted\r\n       the law it follows (as will afterwards be shown) that the _vis\r\n       viva_ of the molecules of all gases is a constant quantity, is\r\n       quite sufficient reason for retaining the hypothesis, if not\r\n       for believing in it as a fact beyond doubt. And such is the\r\n       whole doctrine of atoms. And since by the acceptance of the law\r\n       it became possible to foretell even the properties and atomic\r\n       weights of elements which had not yet been discovered, and these\r\n       predictions afterwards proved to be in agreement with the actual\r\n       facts, it is evident that the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt penetrates\r\n       deeply into the nature of the chemical relation of substances.\r\n       This being granted, it is possible at the present time to exhibit\r\n       and deduce the truth under consideration in many ways, and in\r\n       every case, like all that is highest in science (for example,\r\n       the laws of the indestructibility of matter, of the conservation\r\n       of energy, of gravity, &c.), it proves to be not an empirical\r\n       conclusion from direct observation and experiment, not a direct\r\n       result of analysis, but a creation, or instinctive penetration,\r\n       of the inquiring mind, guided and directed by experiment and\r\n       observation--a synthesis of which the exact sciences are\r\n       capable equally with the highest forms of art. Without such a\r\n       synthetical process of reasoning, science would only be a mass\r\n       of disconnected results of arduous labour, and would not be\r\n       distinguished by that vitality with which it is really endowed\r\n       when once it succeeds in attaining a synthesis, or concordance\r\n       of outward form with the inner nature of things, without losing\r\n       sight of the diversities of individual parts; in short, when\r\n       it discovers by means of outward phenomena, which are apparent\r\n       to the sense of touch, to observation, and to the common mind,\r\n       the internal signification of things--discovering simplicity in\r\n       complexity and uniformity in diversity. And this is the highest\r\n       problem of science.\r\n\r\nThe law of Avogadro-Gerhardt may also be easily expressed in an\r\nalgebraical form. If the weight of a molecule, or of that quantity\r\nof a substance which enters into chemical reaction and occupies in a\r\nstate of vapour, according to the law, a volume equal to that occupied\r\nby the molecules of other bodies, be indicated by the letters M_{1},\r\nM_{2} ... or, in general, M, and if the letters D_{1}, D_{2}, ... or,\r\nin general, D, stand for the density or weight of a given volume of the\r\ngases or vapours of the corresponding substances under certain definite\r\nconditions of temperature and pressure, then the law requires that\r\n\r\n                 M_{1}/D_{1} = M_{2}/D_{2} ... = M/D = C\r\n\r\nwhere C is a certain constant. This expression shows directly that the\r\nvolumes corresponding with the weights M_{1}, M_{2} ... M, are equal to\r\na certain constant, because the volume is proportional to the weight and\r\ninversely proportional to the density. The magnitude of C is naturally\r\nconditioned by and dependent on the units taken for the expression of\r\nthe weights of the molecules and the densities. The weight of a molecule\r\n(equal to the sum of the atomic weights of the elements forming it) is\r\nusually expressed by taking the weight of an atom of hydrogen as unity,\r\nand hydrogen is now also chosen as the unit for the expression of the\r\ndensities of gases and vapours; it is therefore only necessary to find\r\nthe magnitude of the constant for any one compound, as it will be the\r\nsame for all others. Let us take water. Its reacting mass is expressed\r\n(conditionally and relatively) by the formula or molecule H_{2}O,\r\nfor which M = 18, if H = 1, as we already know from the composition\r\nof water. Its vapour density, or D, compared to hydrogen = 9, and\r\nconsequently for water C = 2, and therefore and in general for the\r\nmolecules of all substances M/D = 2.\r\n\r\nConsequently the weight of a molecule is equal to twice its vapour\r\ndensity expressed in relation to hydrogen, and conversely _the density\r\nof a gas is equal to half the molecular weight referred to hydrogen_.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this may be seen from a very large number of observed\r\nvapour densities by comparing them with the results obtained by\r\ncalculation. As an illustration, we may point out that for ammonia,\r\nNH_{3}, the weight of the molecule or quantity of the reacting\r\nsubstance, as well as the composition and weight corresponding with\r\nthe formula, is expressed by the figures 14 + 3 = 17. Consequently M\r\n= 17. Hence, according to the law, D = 8·5. And this result is also\r\nobtained by experiment. The density, according to both formula and\r\nexperiment, of nitrous oxide, N_{2}O, is 22, of nitric acid 15, and of\r\nnitric peroxide 23. In the case of nitrous anhydride, N_{2}O_{3}, as a\r\nsubstance which dissociates into NO + NO_{2}, the density should vary\r\nbetween 38 (so long as the N_{2}O_{3} remains unchanged) and 19 (when\r\nNO + NO_{2} is obtained). There are no figures of constant density for\r\nH_{2}O_{2}, NHO_{3}, N_{2}O_{4}, and many similar compounds which are\r\neither wholly or partially decomposed in passing into vapour. Salts and\r\nsimilar substances either have no vapour density because they do not\r\npass into vapour (for instance, potassium nitrate, KNO_{3}) without\r\ndecomposition, or, if they pass into vapour without decomposing,\r\ntheir vapour density is observed with difficulty only at very high\r\ntemperatures. The practical determination of the vapour density at these\r\nhigh temperatures (for example, for sodium chloride, ferrous chloride,\r\nstannous chloride, &c.) requires special methods which have been worked\r\nout by Sainte-Claire Deville, Crafts, Nilson and Pettersson, Meyer,\r\nScott, and others. Having overcome the difficulties of experiment, it\r\nis found that the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt holds good for such salts\r\nas potassium iodide, beryllium chloride, aluminium chloride, ferrous\r\nchloride, &c.--that is, the density obtained by experiment proves to\r\nbe equal to half the molecular weight--naturally within the limits of\r\nexperimental error or of possible deviation from the law.\r\n\r\nGerhardt deduced his law from a great number of examples of volatile\r\ncarbon compounds. We shall become acquainted with certain of them in\r\nthe following chapters; their entire study, from the complexity of\r\nthe subject, and from long-established custom, forms the subject of a\r\nspecial branch of chemistry termed 'organic' chemistry. With all these\r\nsubstances the observed and calculated densities are very similar.\r\n\r\nWhen the consequences of a law are verified by a great number of\r\nobservations, it should be considered as confirmed by experiment. But\r\nthis does not exclude the possibility of _apparent_ deviations. They may\r\nevidently be of two kinds: the fraction M/D may be found to be either\r\ngreater or less than 2--that is, the calculated density may be either\r\ngreater or less than the observed density. When the difference between\r\nthe results of experiment and calculation falls within the possible\r\nerrors of experiment (for example, equal to hundredths of the density),\r\nor within a possible error owing to the laws of gases having an only\r\napproximate application (as is seen from the deviations, for instance,\r\nfrom the law of Boyle and Mariotte), then the fraction M/D proves but\r\nslightly different from 2 (between 1·9 and 2·2), and such cases as these\r\nmay be classed among those which ought to be expected from the nature\r\nof the subject. It is a different matter if the quotient of M/D be\r\nseveral times, and in general a multiple, _greater_ or less than 2. The\r\napplication of the law must then be explained or it must be laid aside,\r\nbecause the laws of nature admit of no exceptions. We will therefore\r\ntake two such cases, and first one in which the _quotient_ M/D _is\r\ngreater than 2, or the density obtained by experiment is less than is in\r\naccordance with the law_.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, as a consequence of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt,\r\nthat there is a decomposition in those cases where the volume of the\r\nvapour corresponding with the weight of the amount of a substance\r\nentering into reaction is greater than the volume of two parts by\r\nweight of hydrogen. Suppose the density of the vapour of water to be\r\ndetermined at a temperature above that at which it is decomposed,\r\nthen, if not all, at any rate a large proportion of the water will be\r\ndecomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. The density of such a mixture of\r\ngases, or of detonating gas, will be less than that of aqueous vapour;\r\nit will be equal to 6 (compared with hydrogen), because 1 volume of\r\noxygen weighs 16, and 2 volumes of hydrogen 2; and, consequently, 3\r\nvolumes of detonating gas weigh 18 and 1 volume 6, while the density\r\nof aqueous vapour = 9. Hence, if the density of aqueous vapour be\r\ndetermined after its decomposition, the quotient M/D would be found\r\nto be 3 and not 2. This phenomenon might be considered as a deviation\r\nfrom Gerhardt's law, but this would not be correct, because it may be\r\nshown by means of diffusion through porous substances, as described in\r\nChapter II., that water is decomposed at such high temperatures. In the\r\ncase of water itself there can naturally be no doubt, because its vapour\r\ndensity agrees with the law at all temperatures at which it has been\r\ndetermined.[12] But there are many substances which decompose with great\r\nease directly they are volatilised, and therefore only exist as solids\r\nor liquids, and not in a state of vapour. There are, for example, many\r\nsalts of this kind, besides all definite solutions having a constant\r\nboiling point, all the compounds of ammonia for example, all ammonium\r\nsalts--&c. Their vapour densities, determined by Bineau, Deville, and\r\nothers, show that they do not agree with Gerhardt's law. Thus the\r\nvapour density of sal-ammoniac, NH_{4}Cl, is nearly 14 (compared with\r\nhydrogen), whilst its molecular weight is not less than 53·5, whence the\r\nvapour density should be nearly 27, according to the law. The molecule\r\nof sal-ammoniac cannot be less than NH_{4}Cl, because it is formed from\r\nthe molecules NH_{3} and HCl, and contains single atoms of nitrogen\r\nand chlorine, and therefore cannot be divided; it further never enters\r\ninto reactions with the molecules of other substances (for instance,\r\npotassium hydroxide, or nitric acid) in quantities of less than 53·5\r\nparts by weight, &c. The calculated density (about 27) is here double\r\nthe observed density (about 13·4); hence M/D = 4 and not 2. For this\r\nreason the vapour density of sal-ammoniac for a long time served as an\r\nargument for doubting the truth of the law. But it proved otherwise,\r\nafter the matter had been fully investigated. The low density depends\r\non the decomposition of sal-ammoniac, on volatilising, into ammonia and\r\nhydrogen chloride. The observed density is not that of sal-ammoniac, but\r\nof a mixture of NH_{3} and HCl, which should be nearly 14, because the\r\ndensity of NH_{3} = 8·5 and of HCl = 18·2, and therefore the density\r\nof their mixture (in equal volumes) should be about 13·4.[13] The\r\nactual decomposition of the vapours of sal-ammoniac was demonstrated\r\nby Pebal and Than by the same method as the decomposition of water,\r\nby passing the vapour of sal-ammoniac through a porous substance. The\r\nexperiment demonstrating the decomposition during volatilisation of\r\nsal-ammoniac may be made very easily, and is a very instructive point\r\nin the history of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, because without its\r\naid it would never have been imagined that sal-ammoniac decomposed\r\nin volatilising, as this decomposition bears all the signs of simple\r\nsublimation; consequently the knowledge of the decomposition itself\r\nwas forestalled by the law. The whole aim and practical use of the\r\ndiscovery of the laws of nature consists in, and is shown by, the fact\r\nthat they enable the unknown to be foretold, the unobserved to be\r\nforeseen. The arrangement of the experiment is based on the following\r\nreasoning.[14] According to the law and to experiment, the density of\r\nammonia, NH_{3}, is 8-1/2, and of hydrochloric acid, HCl, 18-1/4, if\r\nthe density of hydrogen = 1. Consequently, in a mixture of NH_{3} and\r\nHCl, the ammonia will penetrate much more rapidly through a porous\r\nmass, or a fine orifice, than the heavier hydrochloric acid, just as\r\nin a former experiment the hydrogen penetrated more rapidly than the\r\noxygen. Therefore, if the vapour of sal-ammoniac comes into contact with\r\na porous mass, the ammonia will pass through it in greater quantities\r\nthan the hydrochloric acid, and this excess of ammonia may be detected\r\nby means of moist red litmus paper, which should be turned blue. If the\r\nvapour of sal-ammoniac were not decomposed, it would pass through the\r\nporous mass as a whole, and the colour of the litmus paper would not\r\nbe altered, because sal-ammoniac is a neutral salt. Thus, by testing\r\nwith litmus the substances passing through the porous mass, it may be\r\ndecided whether the sal-ammoniac is decomposed or not when passing into\r\nvapour. Sal-ammoniac volatilises at so moderate a temperature that the\r\nexperiment may be conducted in a glass tube heated by means of a lamp,\r\nan asbestos plug being placed near the centre of the tube.[15] The\r\nasbestos forms a porous mass, which is unaltered at a high temperature.\r\nA piece of dry sal-ammoniac is placed at one side of the asbestos\r\nplug, and is heated by a Bunsen burner. The vapours formed are driven\r\nby a current of air forced from a gasometer or bag through two tubes\r\ncontaining pieces of moist litmus paper, one blue and one red paper\r\nin each. If the sal-ammoniac be heated, then the ammonia appears on\r\nthe opposite side of the asbestos plug, and the litmus there turns\r\nblue. And as an excess of hydrochloric acid remains on the side where\r\nthe sal-ammoniac is heated, it turns the litmus at that end red. This\r\nproves that the sal-ammoniac, when converted into vapour, splits up into\r\nammonia and hydrochloric acid, and at the same time gives an instance of\r\nthe possibility of correctly conjecturing a fact on the basis of the law\r\nof Avogadro-Gerhardt.[15 bis]\r\n\r\n  [12] As the density of aqueous vapour remains constant within the\r\n       limits of experimental accuracy, even at 1,000°, when\r\n       dissociation has certainly commenced, it would appear that only a\r\n       very small amount of water is decomposed at these temperatures.\r\n       If even 10 p.c. of water were decomposed, the density would be\r\n       8·57 and the quotient M/D = 2·1, but at the high temperatures\r\n       here concerned the error of experiment is not greater than the\r\n       difference between this quantity and 2. And probably at 1,000°\r\n       the dissociation is far from being equal to 10 p.c. _Hence the\r\n       variation in the vapour density of water does not give us the\r\n       means of ascertaining the amount of its dissociation._\r\n\r\n  [13] This explanation of the vapour density of sal-ammoniac, sulphuric\r\n       acid, and similar substances which decompose in being distilled\r\n       was the most natural to resort to as soon as the application of\r\n       the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt to chemical relations was begun; it\r\n       was, for instance, given in my work on _Specific Volumes_, 1856,\r\n       p. 99. The formula, M/D = 2, which was applied later by many\r\n       other investigators, had already been made use of in that work.\r\n\r\n  [14] The beginner must remember that an experiment and the mode in\r\n       which it is carried out must be determined by the principle or\r\n       fact which it is intended to illustrate, and not _vice versa_,\r\n       as some suppose. The idea which determines the necessity of an\r\n       experiment is the chief consideration.\r\n\r\n  [15] It is important that the tubes, asbestos, and sal-ammoniac should\r\n       be dry, as otherwise the moisture retains the ammonia and\r\n       hydrogen chloride.\r\n\r\n  [15 bis] Baker (1894) showed that the decomposition of NH_{4}Cl in\r\n       the act of volatilising only takes place in the presence of water,\r\n       traces of which are amply sufficient, but that in the total\r\n       absence of moisture (attained by carefully drying with P_{2}O_{5})\r\n       there is no decomposition, and the vapour density of the\r\n       sal-ammoniac is found to be normal, _i.e._, nearly 27. It is not\r\n       yet quite clear what part the trace of moisture plays here, and it\r\n       must be presumed that the phenomenon belongs to the category of\r\n       electrical and contact phenomena, which have not yet been fully\r\n       explained (_see_ Chapter IX., Note 29).\r\n\r\nSo also the fact of a decomposition may be proved in the other instances\r\nwhere M/D proved greater than 2, and hence the apparent deviations\r\nappear in reality as an excellent proof of the general application and\r\nsignificance of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the _quotient_ M/D proves to be _less_ than 2,\r\nor the observed density _greater_ than that calculated, by a multiple\r\nnumber of times, the matter is evidently more simple, and the fact\r\nobserved only indicates that the weight of the molecule is as many times\r\ngreater as that taken as the quotient obtained is less than 2. So, for\r\ninstance, in the case of ethylene, whose composition is expressed by\r\nCH_{2}, the density was found by experiment to be 14, and in the case\r\nof amylene, whose composition is also CH_{2}, the density proved to be\r\n35, and consequently the quotient for ethylene = 1, and for amylene =\r\n2/5. If the molecular weight of ethylene be taken, not as 14, as might\r\nbe imagined from its composition, but as twice as great--namely, as\r\n28--and for amylene as five times greater--that is as 70--then the\r\nmolecular composition of the first will be C_{2}H_{4}, and of the\r\nsecond C_{5}H_{10}, and for both of them M/D will be equal to 2. This\r\napplication of the law, which at first sight may appear perfectly\r\narbitrary, is nevertheless strictly correct, because the amount of\r\nethylene which reacts--for example, with sulphuric and other acids--is\r\nnot equal to 14, but to 28 parts by weight. Thus with H_{2}SO_{4},\r\nBr_{2}, or HI, &c., ethylene combines in a quantity C_{2}H_{4}, and\r\namylene in a quantity C_{5}H_{10}, and not CH_{2}. On the other hand,\r\nethylene is a gas which liquefies with difficulty (absolute boiling\r\npoint = +10°), whilst amylene is a liquid boiling at 35° (absolute\r\nboiling point = +192°), and by admitting the greater density of the\r\nmolecules of amylene (M = 70) its difference from the lighter molecules\r\nof ethylene (M = 28) becomes clear. Thus, the smaller quotient M/D\r\nis _an indication of polymerisation_, as the larger quotient is of\r\ndecomposition. The difference between the densities of oxygen and ozone\r\nis a case in point.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the elements, it is found in certain cases, especially\r\nwith metals--for instance, mercury, zinc, and cadmium--that that weight\r\nof the atoms which must be acknowledged in their compounds (of which\r\nmention will be afterwards made) appears to be also the molecular\r\nweight. Thus, the atomic weight of mercury must be taken as = 200,\r\nbut the vapour density = 100, and the quotient = 2. Consequently the\r\n_molecule of mercury contains one atom_, Hg. It is the same with sodium,\r\ncadmium, and zinc. This is the simplest possible molecule, which\r\nnecessarily is only possible in the case of elements, as the molecule\r\nof a compound must contain at least two atoms. However, the molecules\r\nof many of the elements prove to be complex--for instance, the weight\r\nof an atom of oxygen = 16, and its density = 16, so that its molecule\r\nmust contain two atoms, O_{2}, which might already be concluded by\r\ncomparing its density with that of ozone, whose molecule contains O_{3}\r\n(Chapter IV.) So also the molecule of hydrogen equals H_{2}, of chlorine\r\nCl_{2}, of nitrogen N_{2}, &c. If chlorine react with hydrogen, the\r\nvolume remains unaltered after the formation of hydrochloric acid,\r\nH_{2} + Cl_{2} = HCl + HCl. It is a case of substitution between the\r\none and the other, and therefore the volumes remain constant. There\r\nare elements whose molecules are much more complex--for instance,\r\nsulphur, S_{6}--although, by heating, the density is reduced to a third,\r\nand S_{2} is formed. Judging from the vapour density of phosphorus\r\n(D = 62) the molecule contains four atoms P_{4}. Hence many elements\r\nwhen polymerised appear in molecules which are more complex than the\r\nsimplest possible. In carbon, as we shall afterwards find, a very\r\ncomplex molecule must be admitted, as otherwise its non-volatility and\r\nother properties cannot be understood. And if compounds are decomposed\r\nby a more or less powerful heat, and if polymeric substances are\r\ndepolymerised (that is, the weight of the molecule diminishes) by a rise\r\nof temperature, as N_{2}O_{4} passes into NO_{2}, or ozone, O_{3}, into\r\nordinary oxygen, O_{2}, then we might expect to find the splitting-up of\r\nthe complex molecules of elements into the simplest molecule containing\r\na single atom only--that is to say, if O_{2} be obtained from O_{3},\r\nthen the formation of O might also be looked for. The possibility but\r\nnot proof of such a proposition is indicated by the vapour of iodine.\r\nIts normal density = 127 (Dumas, Deville, and others), which corresponds\r\nwith the molecule I_{2}. At temperatures above 800° (up to which the\r\ndensity remains almost constant), this density distinctly decreases, as\r\nis seen from the verified results obtained by Victor Meyer, Crafts, and\r\nTroost. At the ordinary pressure and 1,000° it is about 100, at 1,250°\r\nabout 80, at 1,400° about 75, and apparently it strives to reduce itself\r\nto one-half--that is, to 63. Under a reduced pressure this splitting-up,\r\nor depolymerisation, of iodine vapour actually reaches a density[16]\r\nof 66, as Crafts demonstrated by reducing the pressure to 100 mm. and\r\nraising the temperature to 1,500°. From this it may be concluded that\r\nat high temperatures and low pressures the molecule I_{2} gradually\r\npasses into the molecule I containing one atom like mercury, and that\r\nsomething similar occurs with other elements at a considerable rise of\r\ntemperature, which tends to bring about the disunion of compounds and\r\nthe decomposition of complex molecules.[17]\r\n\r\n  [16] Just as we saw (Chapter VI. Note 46) an increase of the\r\n       dissociation of N_{2}O_{4} and the formation of a large\r\n       proportion of NO_{2}, with a decrease of pressure. The\r\n       decomposition of I_{2} into I + I is a similar dissociation.\r\n\r\n  [17] Although at first there appeared to be a similar phenomenon in the\r\n       case of chlorine, it was afterwards proved that if there is\r\n       a decrease of density it is only a small one. In the case of\r\n       bromine it is not much greater, and is far from being equal to\r\n       that for iodine.\r\n\r\n       As in general we very often involuntarily confuse chemical\r\n       processes with physical, it may be that a physical process\r\n       of change in the coefficient of expansion with a change of\r\n       temperature participates with a change in molecular weight,\r\n       and partially, if not wholly, accounts for the decrease of the\r\n       density of chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Thus, I have remarked\r\n       (Comptes Rendus, 1876) that the coefficient of expansion of\r\n       gases increases with their molecular weight, and (Chapter II.,\r\n       Note 26) the results of direct experiment show the coefficient\r\n       of expansion of hydrobromic acid (M = 81) to be 0·00386 instead\r\n       of 0·00367, which is that of hydrogen (M = 2). Hence, in the\r\n       case of the vapour of iodine (M = 254) a very large coefficient\r\n       of expansion is to be expected, and from this cause alone\r\n       the relative density would fall. As the molecule of chlorine\r\n       Cl_{2} is lighter (= 71) than that of bromine (= 160), which is\r\n       lighter than that of iodine (= 254), we see that the order in\r\n       which the decomposability of the vapours of these haloids is\r\n       observed corresponds with the expected rise in the coefficient of\r\n       expansion. Taking the coefficient of expansion of iodine vapour\r\n       as 0·004, then at 1,000° its density would be 116. Therefore\r\n       the dissociation of iodine may be only an apparent phenomenon.\r\n       However, on the other hand, the heavy vapour of mercury (M = 200,\r\n       D = 100) scarcely decreases in density at a temperature of 1,500°\r\n       (D = 98, according to Victor Meyer); but it must not be forgotten\r\n       that the molecule of mercury contains only one atom, whilst that\r\n       of iodine contains two, and this is very important. Questions\r\n       of this kind which are difficult to decide by experimental\r\n       methods must long remain without a certain explanation, owing to\r\n       the difficulty, and sometimes impossibility, of distinguishing\r\n       between physical and chemical changes.\r\n\r\nBesides these cases of apparent discrepancy from the law of\r\nAvogadro-Gerhardt there is yet a third, which is the last, and is very\r\ninstructive. In the investigation of separate substances they have to be\r\nisolated in the purest possible form, and their chemical and physical\r\nproperties, and among them the vapour density, then determined. If\r\nit be normal--that is, if D = M/2--it often serves as a proof of the\r\npurity of the substance, _i.e._ of its freedom from all foreign matter.\r\nIf it be abnormal--that is, if D be not equal to M/2--then for those\r\nwho do not believe in the law it appears as a new argument against it\r\nand nothing more; but to those who have already grasped the important\r\nsignificance of the law it becomes clear that there is some error in\r\nthe observation, or that the density was determined under conditions in\r\nwhich the vapour does not follow the laws of Boyle or Gay-Lussac, or\r\nelse that the substance has not been sufficiently purified, and contains\r\nother substances. The law of Avogadro-Gerhardt in that case furnishes\r\nconvincing evidence of the necessity of a fresh and more exact research.\r\nAnd as yet the causes of error have always been found. There are not a\r\nfew examples in point in the recent history of chemistry. We will cite\r\none instance. In the case of pyrosulphuryl chloride, S_{2}O_{5}Cl_{2},\r\nM = 215, and consequently D should = 107·5, instead of which Ogier and\r\nothers obtained 53·8--that is, a density half as great; and further,\r\nOgier (1882) demonstrated clearly that the substance is not dissociated\r\nby distillation into SO_{3} and SO_{2}Cl_{2}, or any other two products,\r\nand thus the abnormal density of S_{2}O_{5}Cl_{2} remained unexplained\r\nuntil D. P. Konovaloff (1885) showed that the previous investigators\r\nwere working with a mixture (containing SO_{3}HCl), and that\r\npyrosulphuryl chloride has a normal density of approximately 107. Had\r\nnot the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt served as a guide, the impure liquid\r\nwould have still passed as pure; the more so since the determination of\r\nthe amount of chlorine could not aid in the discovery of the impurity.\r\nThus, by following a true law of nature we are led to true deductions.\r\n\r\nAll cases which have been studied confirm the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt,\r\nand as by it a deduction is obtained, from the determination of the\r\nvapour density (a purely physical property), as to the weight of the\r\nmolecule or quantity of a substance entering into chemical reaction,\r\nthis law links together the two provinces of learning--physics and\r\nchemistry--in the most intimate manner. Besides which, the law of\r\nAvogadro-Gerhardt places the conceptions of _molecules_ and _atoms_ on\r\na firm foundation, which was previously wanting. Although since the\r\ndays of Dalton it had become evident that it was necessary to admit the\r\nexistence of the elementary atom (the chemical individual indivisible\r\nby chemical or other forces), and of the groups of atoms (or molecules)\r\nof compounds, indivisible by mechanical and physical forces; still\r\nthe relative magnitude of the molecule and atom was not defined with\r\nsufficient clearness. Thus, for instance, the atomic weight of oxygen\r\nmight be taken as 8 or 16, or any multiple of these numbers, and nothing\r\nindicated a reason for the acceptation of one rather than another of\r\nthese magnitudes;[18] whilst as regards the weights of the molecules of\r\nelements and compounds there was no trustworthy knowledge whatever. With\r\nthe establishment of Gerhardt's law the idea of the molecule was fully\r\ndefined, as well as the relative magnitude of the elementary atom.\r\n\r\n  [18] And so it was in the fifties. Some took O = 8, others O = 16.\r\n       Water in the first case would be HO and hydrogen peroxide HO_{2},\r\n       and in the second case, as is now generally accepted, water\r\n       H_{2}O and hydrogen peroxide H_{2}O_{2} or HO. Disagreement\r\n       and confusion reigned. In 1860 the chemists of the whole world\r\n       met at Carlsruhe for the purpose of arriving at some agreement\r\n       and uniformity of opinion. I was present at this Congress, and\r\n       well remember how great was the difference of opinion, and how\r\n       a compromise was advocated with great acumen by many scientific\r\n       men, and with what warmth the followers of Gerhardt, at whose\r\n       head stood the Italian professor, Canizzaro, followed up the\r\n       consequences of the law of Avogadro. In the spirit of scientific\r\n       freedom, without which science would make no progress, and would\r\n       remain petrified as in the middle ages, and with the simultaneous\r\n       necessity of scientific conservatism, without which the roots\r\n       of past study could give no fruit, a compromise was not arrived\r\n       at, nor ought it to have been, but instead of it truth, in the\r\n       form of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, received by means of the\r\n       Congress a wider development, and soon afterwards conquered all\r\n       minds. Then the new so-called Gerhardt atomic weights established\r\n       themselves, and in the seventies they were already in general use.\r\n\r\nThe chemical particle or _molecule must be considered as the quantity\r\nof a substance which enters into chemical reaction with other molecules,\r\nand occupies in a state of vapour the same volume as two parts by weight\r\nof hydrogen_.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weight (which has been indicated by M) of a substance is\r\ndetermined by its composition, transformations, and vapour density.\r\n\r\nThe molecule is not divisible by the mechanical and physical changes\r\nof substances, but in chemical reaction it is either altered in its\r\nproperties, or quantity, or structure, or in the nature of the motion of\r\nits parts.\r\n\r\nAn agglomeration of molecules, which are alike in all chemical respects,\r\nmakes up the masses of homogeneous substances in all states.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] A bubble of gas, a drop of liquid, or the smallest crystal,\r\n       presents an agglomeration of a number of molecules, in a state of\r\n       continual motion (like the stars of the Milky Way), distributing\r\n       themselves evenly or forming new systems. If the aggregation of\r\n       all kinds of heterogeneous molecules be possible in a gaseous\r\n       state, where the molecules are considerably removed from each\r\n       other, then in a liquid state, where they are already close\r\n       together, such an aggregation becomes possible only in the\r\n       sense of the mutual reaction between them which results from\r\n       their chemical attraction, and especially in the aptitude of\r\n       heterogeneous molecules for combining together. Solutions and\r\n       other so-called indefinite chemical compounds should be regarded\r\n       in this light. According to the principles developed in this\r\n       work we should regard them as containing both the compounds of\r\n       the heterogeneous molecules themselves and the products of their\r\n       decomposition, as in peroxide of nitrogen, N_{2}O_{4} and NO_{2}.\r\n       And we must consider that those molecules A, which at a given\r\n       moment are combined with B in AB, will in the following moment\r\n       become free in order to again enter into a combined form. The\r\n       laws of chemical equilibrium proper to dissociated systems cannot\r\n       be regarded in any other light.\r\n\r\nMolecules consist of atoms in a certain state of distribution and\r\nmotion, just as the solar system[20] is made up of inseparable parts\r\n(the sun, planets, satellites, comets, &c.) The greater the number of\r\natoms in a molecule, the more complex is the resultant substance. The\r\nequilibrium between the dissimilar atoms may be more or less stable,\r\nand may for this reason give more or less stable substances. Physical\r\nand mechanical transformations alter the velocity of the motion and\r\nthe distances between the individual molecules, or of the atoms in the\r\nmolecules, or of their sum total, but they do not alter the original\r\nequilibrium of the system; whilst chemical changes, on the other hand,\r\nalter the molecules themselves, that is, the velocity of motion, the\r\nrelative distribution, and the quality and quantity of the atoms in the\r\nmolecules.\r\n\r\n  [20] This strengthens the fundamental idea of the unity and harmony of\r\n       type of all creation and is one of those ideas which impress\r\n       themselves on man in all ages, and give rise to a hope of\r\n       arriving in time, by means of a laborious series of discoveries,\r\n       observations, experiments, laws, hypotheses, and theories, at\r\n       a comprehension of the internal and invisible structure of\r\n       concrete substances with that same degree of clearness and\r\n       exactitude which has been attained in the visible structure of\r\n       the heavenly bodies. It is not many years ago since the law of\r\n       Avogadro-Gerhardt took root in science. It is within the memory\r\n       of many living scientific men, and of mine amongst others. It is\r\n       not surprising, therefore, that as yet little progress has been\r\n       made in the province of molecular mechanics; but the theory of\r\n       gases alone, which is intimately connected with the conception of\r\n       molecules, shows by its success that the time is approaching when\r\n       our knowledge of the internal structure of matter will be defined\r\n       and established.\r\n\r\n_Atoms are the smallest quantities_ or chemically indivisible masses _of\r\nthe elements forming the molecules_ of elements and compounds.\r\n\r\nAtoms have weight, the sum of their weights forms the weight of the\r\nmolecule, and the sum of the weights of the molecules forms the weight\r\nof masses, and is the cause of gravity, and of all the phenomena which\r\ndepend on the mass of a substance.\r\n\r\nThe elements are characterised, not only by their independent existence,\r\ntheir incapacity of being converted into each other, &c., but also by\r\nthe weight of their atoms.\r\n\r\nChemical and physical properties depend on the weight, composition, and\r\nproperties of the molecules forming a substance, and on the weight and\r\nproperties of the atoms forming the molecules.\r\n\r\nThis is the substance of those principles of molecular mechanics which\r\nlie at the basis of all contemporary physical and chemical constructions\r\nsince the establishment of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt. The fecundity\r\nof the principles enunciated is seen at every step in all the particular\r\ncases forming the present store of chemical data. We will here cite a\r\nfew examples of the application of the law.\r\n\r\nAs the weight of an atom must be understood as the minimum quantity of\r\nan element entering into the composition of all the molecules formed\r\nby it, therefore, in order to find the weight of an atom of oxygen,\r\nlet us take the molecules of those of its compounds which have already\r\nbeen described, together with the molecules of certain of those carbon\r\ncompounds which will be described in the following chapter:\r\n\r\n                 Molecular  Amount of          Molecular  Amount of\r\n                   Weight     Oxygen             Weight     Oxygen\r\n\r\n         H_{2}O     18         16      HNO_{3}    63         48\r\n         N_{2}O     44         16      CO         28         16\r\n         NO         30         16      CO_{2}     44         32\r\n         NO_{2}     46         32\r\n\r\nThe number of substances taken might be considerably increased, but\r\nthe result would be the same--that is, the molecules of the compounds\r\nof oxygen would never be found to contain less than 16 parts by weight\r\nof this element, but always _n_16, where _n_ is a whole number. The\r\nmolecular weights of the above compounds are found either directly from\r\nthe density of their vapour or gas, or from their reactions. Thus, the\r\nvapour density of nitric acid (as a substance which easily decomposes\r\nabove its boiling point) cannot be accurately determined, but the\r\nfact of its containing one part by weight of hydrogen, and all its\r\nproperties and reactions, indicate the above molecular composition and\r\nno other. In this manner it is very easy to find the atomic weight of\r\nall the elements, knowing the molecular weight and composition of their\r\ncompounds. It may, for instance, be easily proved that less than _n_12\r\nparts of carbon never enters into the molecules of carbon compounds,\r\nand therefore C must be taken as 12, and not as 6 which was the number\r\nin use before Gerhardt. In a similar manner the atomic weights now\r\naccepted for the elements oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, chlorine, sulphur,\r\n&c., were found and indubitably established, and they are even now\r\ntermed the Gerhardt atomic weights. As regards the metals, many of\r\nwhich do not give a single volatile compound, we shall afterwards\r\nsee that there are also methods by which their atomic weights may be\r\nestablished, but nevertheless the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt is here\r\nalso ultimately resorted to, in order to remove any doubt which may be\r\nencountered. Thus, for instance, although much that was known concerning\r\nthe compounds of beryllium necessitated its atomic weight being taken\r\nas Be = 9--that is, the oxide as BeO and the chloride BeCl_{2}--still\r\ncertain analogies gave reason for considering its atomic weight to be Be\r\n= 13·5, in which case its oxide would be expressed by the composition\r\nBe_{2}O_{3}, and the chloride by BeCl_{3}.[21] It was then found that\r\nthe vapour density of beryllium chloride was approximately 40, when\r\nit became quite clear that its molecular weight was 80, and as this\r\nsatisfies the formula BeCl_{2}, but does not suit the formula BeCl_{3},\r\nit therefore became necessary to regard the atomic weight of Be as 9 and\r\nnot as 13-1/2.\r\n\r\n  [21] If Be = 9, and beryllium chloride be BeCl_{2}, then for every 9\r\n       parts of beryllium there are 71 parts of chlorine, and the\r\n       molecular weight of BeCl_{2} = 80; hence the vapour density\r\n       should be 40 or _n_{4}0. If Be = 13·5, and beryllium chloride be\r\n       BeCl_{3}, then to 13·5 of beryllium there are 106·5 of chlorine;\r\n       hence the molecular weight would be 120, and the vapour density\r\n       60 or _n_60. The composition is evidently the same in both cases,\r\n       because 9 : 71 :: 13·5 : 106·5. Thus, if the symbol of an element\r\n       designate different atomic weights, apparently very different\r\n       formulæ may equally well express both the percentage composition\r\n       of compounds, and those properties which are required by the laws\r\n       of multiple proportions and equivalents. The chemists of former\r\n       days accurately expressed the composition of substances, and\r\n       accurately applied Dalton's laws, by taking H = 1, O = 8, C = 6,\r\n       Si = 14, &c. The Gerhardt equivalents are also satisfied by them,\r\n       because O = 16, C = 12, Si = 28, &c., are multiples of them.\r\n       The choice of one or the other multiple quantity for the atomic\r\n       weight is impossible without a firm and concrete conception of\r\n       the molecule and atom, and this is only obtained as a consequence\r\n       of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, and hence the modern atomic\r\n       weights are the results of this law (_see_ Note 28).\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of a true conception of molecules and atoms,\r\nchemical formulæ became direct expressions, not only of composition,[22]\r\nbut also of molecular weight or _vapour density_, and consequently of a\r\nseries of fundamental chemical and physical data, inasmuch as a number\r\nof the properties of substances are dependent on their vapour density,\r\nor molecular weight and composition. The vapour density D = M/2. For\r\ninstance, the formula of ethyl ether is C_{4}H_{10}O, corresponding\r\nwith the molecular weight 74, and the vapour density 37, which is the\r\nfact. Therefore, the density of vapours and gases has ceased to be\r\nan empirical magnitude obtained by experiment only, and has acquired\r\na rational meaning. It is only necessary to remember that 2 grams\r\nof hydrogen, or the molecular weight of this primary gas in grams,\r\noccupies, at 0° and 760 mm. pressure, a volume of 22·3 litres (or\r\n22,300 cubic centimetres), in order to directly determine the weights\r\nof cubical measures of gases and vapours from their formulæ, because\r\n_the molecular weights in grams of all other vapours at 0° and 760 mm.\r\noccupy the same volume, 22·3 litres_. Thus, for example, in the case\r\nof carbonic anhydride, CO_{2}, the molecular weight M = 44, hence 44\r\ngrams of carbonic anhydride at 0° and 760 mm. occupy a volume of 22·3\r\nlitres--consequently, a litre weighs 1·97 gram. By combining the laws of\r\ngases--Gay-Lussac's, Mariotte's, and Avogadro-Gerhardt's--we obtain[23]\r\na general formula for gases\r\n\r\n                        6200_s_(273 + _t_) = M_p_\r\n\r\nwhere _s_ is the weight in grams of a cubic centimetre of a vapour or\r\ngas at a temperature _t_ and pressure _p_ (expressed in centimetres of\r\nmercury) if the molecular weight of the gas = M. Thus, for instance, at\r\n100° and 760 millimetres pressure (_i.e._ at the atmospheric pressure)\r\nthe weight of a cubic centimetre of the vapour of ether (M = 74) is _s_\r\n= 0·0024.[24]\r\n\r\n  [22] The percentage amounts of the elements contained in a given\r\n       compound may be calculated from its formula by a simple\r\n       proportion. Thus, for example, to find the percentage amount of\r\n       hydrogen in hydrochloric acid we reason as follows:--HCl shows\r\n       that hydrochloric acid contains 35·5 of chlorine and 1 part of\r\n       hydrogen. Hence, in 36·5 parts of hydrochloric acid there is 1\r\n       part by weight of hydrogen, consequently 100 parts by weight of\r\n       hydrochloric acid will contain as many more units of hydrogen as\r\n       100 is greater than 36·5; therefore, the proportion is as\r\n       follows--_x_ : 1 :: 100 : 36·5 or _x_ = 100/36·5 = 2·739.\r\n       Therefore 100 parts of hydrochloric acid contain 2·739 parts of\r\n       hydrogen. In general, when it is required to transfer a formula\r\n       into its percentage composition, we must replace the symbols by\r\n       their corresponding atomic weights and find their sum, and knowing\r\n       the amount by weight of a given element in it, it is easy by\r\n       proportion to find the amount of this element in 100 or any other\r\n       quantity of parts by weight. If, on the contrary, it be required\r\n       to find the formula from a given percentage composition, we must\r\n       proceed as follows: Divide the percentage amount of each element\r\n       entering into the composition of a substance by its atomic weight,\r\n       and compare the figures thus obtained--they should be in simple\r\n       multiple proportion to each other. Thus, for instance, from the\r\n       percentage composition of hydrogen peroxide, 5·88 of hydrogen and\r\n       94·12 of oxygen, it is easy to find its formula; it is only\r\n       necessary to divide the amount of hydrogen by unity and the amount\r\n       of oxygen by 16. The numbers 5·88 and 5·88 are thus obtained,\r\n       which are in the ratio 1 : 1, which means that in hydrogen\r\n       peroxide there is one atom of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen.\r\n\r\n       The following is a proof of the practical rule given above _that\r\n       to find the ratio of the number of atoms from the percentage\r\n       composition, it is necessary to divide the percentage amounts\r\n       by the atomic weights of the corresponding substances, and to\r\n       find the ratio which these numbers bear to each other_. Let us\r\n       suppose that two radicles (simple or compound), whose symbols\r\n       and combining weights are A and B, combine together, forming\r\n       a compound composed of _x_ atoms of A and _y_ atoms of B. The\r\n       formula of the substance will be A_x_B_y_. From this formula we\r\n       know that our compound contains _x_A parts by weight of the first\r\n       element, and _y_B of the second. In 100 parts of our compound\r\n       there will be (by proportion) (100. _x_A)/(_x_A + _y_B) of the\r\n       first element, and (100. _y_B)/(_x_A + _y_B) of the second. Let\r\n       us divide these quantities, expressing the percentage amounts by\r\n       the corresponding combining weights; we then obtain 100_x_/(_x_A\r\n       + _y_B) for the first element and 100_y_/(_x_A + _y_B) for the\r\n       second element. And these numbers are in the ratio _x_ : _y_--that\r\n       is, in the ratio of the number of atoms of the two substances.\r\n\r\n       It may be further observed that even the very language or\r\n       nomenclature of chemistry acquires a particular clearness and\r\n       conciseness by means of the conception of molecules, because then\r\n       the names of substances may directly indicate their composition.\r\n       Thus the term 'carbon dioxide' tells more about and expresses\r\n       CO_{2} better than carbonic acid gas, or even carbonic anhydride.\r\n       Such nomenclature is already employed by many. But expressing\r\n       the composition without an indication or even hint as to the\r\n       properties, would be neglecting the advantageous side of the\r\n       present nomenclature. Sulphur dioxide, SO_{2}, expresses the same\r\n       as barium dioxide, BaO_{2}, but sulphurous anhydride indicates\r\n       the acid properties of SO_{2}. Probably in time one harmonious\r\n       chemical language will succeed in embracing both advantages.\r\n\r\n  [23] This formula (which is given in my work on 'The Tension of\r\n       Gases,' and in a somewhat modified form in the 'Comptes Rendus,'\r\n       Feb. 1876) is deduced in the following manner. According to the\r\n       law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, M = 2D for all gases, where M is the\r\n       molecular weight and D the density referred to hydrogen. But it is\r\n       equal to the weight _s__{0} of a cubic centimetre of a gas in\r\n       grams at 0° and 76 cm. pressure, divided by 0·0000898, for this is\r\n       the weight in grams of a cubic centimetre of hydrogen. But the\r\n       weight _s_ of a cubic centimetre of a gas at a temperature _t_ and\r\n       under a pressure _p_ (in centimetres) is equal to _s__{0}_p_/76(1\r\n       + _at_). Therefore, _s__{0} = _s_.76(1 + _at_)/_p_; hence D =\r\n       76._s_(1 + _at_)/0·0000898_p_, whence M = 152_s_(1 +\r\n       _at_)/0·0000898_p_, which gives the above expression, because\r\n       1/_a_ = 273, and 152 multiplied by 273 and divided by 0·0000898 is\r\n       nearly 6200. In place of _s_, _m/v_ may be taken, where _m_ is the\r\n       weight and _v_ the volume of a vapour.\r\n\r\n  [24] The above formula may be directly applied in order to ascertain\r\n       the molecular weight from the data; weight of vapour _m_ grms.,\r\n       its volume _v_ c.c., pressure _p_ cm., and temperature _t_°; for\r\n       _s_ = the weight of vapour _m_, divided by the volume _v_, and\r\n       consequently M = 6,200_m_(273 + _t_)/_pv_. Therefore, instead\r\n       of the formula (_see_ Chapter II., Note 34), _pv_ = R(273 +\r\n       _t_), where R varies with the mass and nature of a gas, we\r\n       may apply the formula _pv_ = 6,200(_m_/M)(273 + _t_). These\r\n       formulæ simplify the calculations in many cases. For example,\r\n       required the volume _v_ occupied by 5 grms. of aqueous vapour\r\n       at a temperature _t_ = 127° and under a pressure _p_ = 76 cm.\r\n       According to the formula M = 6,200_m_(273 + _t_)/_pv_, we find\r\n       that _v_ = 9,064 c.c., as in the case of water M = 18, _m_ in\r\n       this instance = 5 grms. (These formulæ, however, like the laws of\r\n       gases, are only approximate.)\r\n\r\nAs the molecules of many elements (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine,\r\nbromine, sulphur--at least at high temperatures) are of uniform\r\ncomposition, the formulæ of the compounds formed by them directly\r\nindicate the composition by volume. So, for example, the formula HNO_{3}\r\ndirectly shows that in the decomposition of nitric acid there is\r\nobtained 1 vol. of hydrogen, 1 vol. of nitrogen, and 3 vols. of oxygen.\r\n\r\nAnd since a great number of mechanical, physical, and chemical\r\nproperties are directly dependent on the elementary and volumetric\r\ncomposition, and on the vapour density, the accepted system of atoms\r\nand molecules gives the possibility of simplifying a number of most\r\ncomplex relations. For instance, it may be easily demonstrated _that\r\nthe vis viva of the molecules of all vapours and gases is alike_. For\r\nit is proved by mechanics that the _vis viva_ of a moving mass = (1/2)\r\n_mv_^2, where _m_ is the mass and _v_ the velocity. For a molecule,\r\n_m_ = M, or the molecular weight, and the velocity of the motion of\r\ngaseous molecules = a constant which we will designate by C, divided\r\nby the square root of the density of the gas[25] = C/[sqrt]D, and as D\r\n= M/2, the _vis viva_ of molecules = C^2--that is, a constant for all\r\nmolecules. _Q.E.D._[26] The specific heat of gases (Chapter XIV.), and\r\nmany other of their properties, are determined by their density, and\r\nconsequently by their molecular weight. Gases and vapours in passing\r\ninto a liquid state evolve the so-called _latent heat_, which also\r\nproves to be in connection with the molecular weight. The observed\r\nlatent heats of carbon bisulphide, CS_{2} = 90, of ether, C_{4}H_{10}O,\r\n= 94, of benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, = 109, of alcohol, C_{2}H_{6}O, = 200,\r\nof chloroform, CHCl_{3}, = 67, &c., show the amount of heat expended\r\nin converting one part by weight of the above substances into vapour.\r\nA great uniformity is observed if the measure of this heat he referred\r\nto the weight of the molecule. For carbon bisulphide the formula CS_{2}\r\nexpresses a weight 76, hence the latent heat of evaporation referred to\r\nthe molecular quantity CS_{2} = 76 x 90 = 6,840, for ether = 9,656, for\r\nbenzene = 8,502, for alcohol = 9,200, for chloroform = 8,007, for water\r\n= 9,620, &c. That is, for molecular quantities, the latent heat varies\r\ncomparatively little, from 7,000 to 10,000 heat units, whilst for equal\r\nparts by weight it is ten times greater for water than for chloroform\r\nand many other substances.[27]\r\n\r\n  [25] Chapter I., Note 34.\r\n\r\n  [26] _The velocity of the transmission of sound through gases and\r\n       vapours_ closely bears on this. It = [sqrt](_Kpg_)/D(1 +\r\n       [Greek: a]_t_), where _K_ is the ratio between the two specific\r\n       heats (it is approximately 1·4 for gases containing two atoms in a\r\n       molecule), _p_ the pressure of the gas expressed by weight (that\r\n       is, the pressure expressed by the height of a column of mercury\r\n       multiplied by the density of mercury), _g_ the acceleration of\r\n       gravity, D the weight of a cubic measure of the gas, [Greek: a] =\r\n       0·00367, and _t_ the temperature. Hence, if _K_ be known, and as D\r\n       can he found from the composition of a gas, we can calculate the\r\n       velocity of the transmission of sound in that gas. Or if this\r\n       velocity be known, we can find _K_. The relative velocities of\r\n       sound in two gases can he easily determined (Kundt).\r\n\r\n       If a horizontal glass tube (about 1 metre long and closed at\r\n       both ends) be full of a gas, and be firmly fixed at its middle\r\n       point, then it is easy to bring the tube and gas into a state\r\n       of vibration, by rubbing it from centre to end with a damp\r\n       cloth. The vibration of the gas is easily rendered visible, if\r\n       the interior of the tube be dusted with lycopodium (the yellow\r\n       powder-dust or spores of the lycopodium plant is often employed\r\n       in medicine), before the gas is introduced and the tube fused\r\n       up. The fine lycopodium powder arranges itself in patches, whose\r\n       number depends on the velocity of sound in the gas. If there\r\n       be 10 patches, then the velocity of sound in the gas is ten\r\n       times slower than in glass. It is evident that this is an easy\r\n       method of comparing the velocity of sound in gases. It has been\r\n       demonstrated by experiment that the velocity of sound in oxygen\r\n       is four times less than in hydrogen, and the square roots of the\r\n       densities and molecular weights of hydrogen and oxygen stand in\r\n       this ratio.\r\n\r\n  [27] If the conception of the molecular weights of substances does not\r\n       give an exact law when applied to the latent heat of evaporation,\r\n       at all events it brings to light a certain uniformity in\r\n       figures, which otherwise only represent the simple result of\r\n       observation. Molecular quantities of liquids appear to expend\r\n       almost equal amounts of heat in their evaporation. It may be said\r\n       that the latent heat of evaporation of molecular quantities is\r\n       approximately constant, because the _vis viva_ of the motion of\r\n       the molecules is, as we saw above, a constant quantity. According\r\n       to thermodynamics the latent heat of evaporation is equal to\r\n       ((_t_ + 273)/E)(_n_´-_n_)_dp_/_d_T × 13·59, where _t_ is the\r\n       boiling point, _n_´ the specific volume (_i.e._ the volume of a\r\n       unit of weight) of the vapour, and _n_ the specific volume of\r\n       the liquid, _dp_/_d_T the variation of the tension with a rise\r\n       of temperature per 1°, and 13·89 the density of the mercury\r\n       according to which the pressure is measured. Thus the latent heat\r\n       of evaporation increases not only with a decrease in the vapour\r\n       density (_i.e._ the molecular weight), but also with an increase\r\n       in the boiling point, and therefore depends on different factors.\r\n\r\nGeneralising from the above, the weight of the molecule determines the\r\nproperties of a substance _independently of its composition_--_i.e._ of\r\nthe number and quality of the atoms entering into the molecule--whenever\r\nthe substance is in a gaseous state (for instance, the density of\r\ngases and vapours, the velocity of sound in them, their specific heat,\r\n&c.), or passes into that state, as we see in the latent heat of\r\nevaporation. This is intelligible from the point of view of the atomic\r\ntheory in its present form, for, besides a rapid motion proper to the\r\nmolecules of gaseous bodies, it is further necessary to postulate that\r\nthese molecules are dispersed in space (filled throughout with the\r\nluminiferous ether) like the heavenly bodies distributed throughout\r\nthe universe. Here, as there, it is only the degree of removal (the\r\ndistance) and the masses of substances which take effect, while\r\nthose peculiarities of a substance which are expressed in chemical\r\ntransformations, and only come into action on near approach or on\r\ncontact, are in abeyance by reason of the dispersal. Hence it is at once\r\nobvious, in the first place, that in the case of solids and liquids,\r\nin which the molecules are closer together than in gases and vapours,\r\na greater complexity is to be expected, _i.e._ a dependence of all\r\nthe properties not only upon the weight of the molecule but also upon\r\nits composition and quality, or upon the properties of the individual\r\nchemical atoms forming the molecule; and, in the second place, that,\r\nin the case of a small number of molecules of any substance being\r\ndisseminated through a mass of another substance--for example, in the\r\nformation of weak (dilute) solutions (although in this case there is\r\nan act of chemical reaction--_i.e._ a combination, decomposition, or\r\nsubstitution)--the dispersed molecules will alter the properties of\r\nthe medium in which they are dissolved, almost in proportion to the\r\nmolecular weight and almost independently of their composition. The\r\ngreater the number of molecules disseminated--_i.e._ the stronger the\r\nsolution--the more clearly defined will those properties become which\r\ndepend upon the composition of the dissolved substance and its relation\r\nto the molecules of the solvent, for the distribution of one kind of\r\nmolecules in the sphere of attraction of others cannot but be influenced\r\nby their mutual chemical reaction. These general considerations give\r\na starting point for explaining why, since the appearance of Van't\r\nHoff's memoir (1886), 'The Laws of Chemical Equilibrium in a Diffused\r\nGaseous or Liquid State' (_see_ Chapter I., Note 19), it has been found\r\nmore and more that _dilute_ (weak) solutions exhibit such variations\r\nof properties as depend wholly upon the weight and number of the\r\nmolecules and not upon their composition, and even give the means of\r\ndetermining the weight of molecules by studying the variations of the\r\nproperties of a solvent on the introduction of a small quantity of a\r\nsubstance passing into solution. Although this subject has been already\r\npartially considered in the first chapter (in speaking of solutions),\r\nand properly belongs to a special (physical) branch of chemistry, we\r\ntouch upon it here because the meaning and importance of molecular\r\nweights are seen in it in a new and peculiar light, and because it gives\r\na method for determining them whenever it is possible to obtain dilute\r\nsolutions. Among the numerous properties of dilute solutions which have\r\nbeen investigated (for instance, the osmotic pressure, vapour tension,\r\nboiling point, internal friction, capillarity, variation with change of\r\ntemperature, specific heat, electroconductivity, index of refraction,\r\n&c.) we will select one--the 'depression' or fall of the temperature of\r\nfreezing (Raoult's cryoscopic method), not only because this method has\r\nbeen the most studied, but also because it is the most easily carried\r\nout and most frequently applied for determining the weight of the\r\nmolecules of substances in solution, although here, owing to the novelty\r\nof the subject there are also many experimental discrepancies which\r\ncannot as yet be explained by theory.[27 bis]\r\n\r\n  [27 bis] The osmotic pressure, vapour tension of the solvent, and\r\n       several other means applied like the cryoscopic method to dilute\r\n       solutions for determining the molecular weight of a substance in\r\n       solution, are more difficult to carry out in practice, and only\r\n       the method of _determining the rise of the boiling point_ of\r\n       dilute solutions can from its facility be placed parallel with the\r\n       cryoscopic method, to which it bears a strong resemblance, as in\r\n       both the solvent changes its state and is partially separated. In\r\n       the boiling point method it passes off in the form of a vapour,\r\n       while in cryoscopic determinations it separates out in the form of\r\n       a solid body.\r\n\r\n       Van't Hoff, starting from the second law of thermodynamics, showed\r\n       that the dependence of the rise of pressure (_dp_) upon a rise of\r\n       temperature (_d_T) is determined by the equation _dp_ =\r\n       (_kmp_/2T^2)_d_T, where _k_ is the latent heat of evaporation of\r\n       the solvent, _m_ its molecular weight, _p_ the tension of the\r\n       saturated vapour of the solvent at T, and T the absolute\r\n       temperature (T = 273 + _t_), while Raoult found that the quantity\r\n       (_p_-_p´_)/_p_ (Chapter I., Note 50) or the measure of the\r\n       relative fall of tension (_p_ the tension of the solvent or water,\r\n       and _p´_ of the solution) is found by the ratio of the number of\r\n       molecules, _n_ of the substance dissolved, and N of the solvent,\r\n       so that (_p_-_p´_)/_p_ = C_n_/(N + _n_) where C is a constant.\r\n       With very dilute solutions _p_ _-p´_ may be taken as equal to\r\n       _dp_, and the fraction _n_/(N + _n_) as equal to _n_/N (because in\r\n       that case the value of N is very much greater than _n_), and then,\r\n       judging from experiment, C is nearly unity--hence: _dp/p_ = _n_/N\r\n       or _dp_ = _np_/N, and on substituting this in the above equation\r\n       we have (_kmp_/2T^2)_d_T = _np_/N. Taking a weight of the solvent\r\n       _m_/N = 100, and of the substance dissolved (per 100 of the\r\n       solvent) _q_, where _q_ evidently = _n_M, if M be the molecular\r\n       weight of the substance dissolved, we find that _n_/N = _qm_/100M,\r\n       and hence, according to the preceding equation, we have M =\r\n       (0·02T^2/_k_)·(_q_/_d_T), that is, by taking a solution of _q_\r\n       grms. of a substance in 100 grms. of a solvent, and determining by\r\n       experiment the rise of the boiling point _d_T, we find the\r\n       molecular weight M of the substance dissolved, because the\r\n       fraction 0·02T^2/_k_ is (for a given pressure and solvent) a\r\n       constant; for water at 100° (T = 373°) when _k_ = 534 (Chapter I.,\r\n       Note 11), it is nearly 5·2, for ether nearly 21, for bisulphide of\r\n       carbon nearly 24, for alcohol nearly 11·5, &c. As an example, we\r\n       will cite from the determinations made by Professor Sakurai, of\r\n       Japan (1893), that when water was the solvent and the substance\r\n       dissolved, corrosive sublimate, HgCl_{2}, was taken in the\r\n       quantity _q_ = 8·978 and 4·253 grms., the rise in the boiling\r\n       point _d_T was = O°·179 and 0°·084, whence M = 261 and 263, and\r\n       when alcohol was the solvent, _q_ = 10·873 and 8·765 and _d_T =\r\n       0°·471 and 0°·380, whence M = 266 and 265, whilst the actual\r\n       molecular weight of corrosive sublimate = 271, which is very near\r\n       to that given by this method. In the same manner for aqueous\r\n       solutions of sugar (M = 342), when _q_ varied from 14 to 2·4, and\r\n       the rise of the boiling point from 0°·21 to 0°·035, M was found to\r\n       vary between 339 and 364. For solutions of iodine I_{2} in ether,\r\n       the molecular weight was found by this method to be between 255\r\n       and 262, and I_{2} = 254. Sakurai obtained similar results\r\n       (between 247 and 262) for solutions of iodine in bisulphide of\r\n       carbon.\r\n\r\n       We will here remark that in determining M (the molecular weight of\r\n       the substance dissolved) at small but increasing concentrations\r\n       (per 100 grms. of water), the results obtained by Julio Baroni\r\n       (1893) show that the value of M found by the formula may either\r\n       increase or decrease. An increase, for instance, takes place in\r\n       aqueous solutions of HgCl_{2} (from 255 to 334 instead of 271),\r\n       KNO_{3} (57-66 instead of 101), AgNO_{3} (104-107 instead of 170),\r\n       K_{2}SO_{4} (55-89 instead of 174), sugar (328-348 instead of\r\n       342), &c. On the contrary the calculated value of M decreases as\r\n       the concentration increases, for solutions of KCl (40-39 instead\r\n       of 74·5), NaCl (33-28 instead of 58·5), NaBr (60-49 instead of\r\n       103), &c. In this case (as also for LiCl, NaI, C_{2}H_{3}NaO_{2},\r\n       &c.) the value of _i_ (Chapter I., Note 49), or the ratio between\r\n       the actual molecular weight and that found by the rise of the\r\n       boiling point, was found to increase with the concentration,\r\n       _i.e._ to be greater than 1, and to differ more and more from\r\n       unity as the strength of the solution becomes greater. For\r\n       example, according to Schlamp (1894), for LiCl, with a variation\r\n       of from 1·1 to 6·7 grm. LiCl per 100 of water, _i_ varies from\r\n       1·63 to 1·89. But for substances of the first series (HgCl_{2},\r\n       &c.), although in very dilute solutions _i_ is greater than 1, it\r\n       approximates to 1 as the concentration increases, and this is the\r\n       normal phenomenon for solutions which do not conduct an electric\r\n       current, as, for instance, of sugar. And with certain\r\n       electrolytes, such as HgCl_{2}, MgSO_{4}, &c., _i_ exhibits a\r\n       similar variation; thus, for HgCl_{2} the value of M is found to\r\n       vary between 255 and 334; that is, _i_ (as the molecular weight =\r\n       271) varies between 1·06 and 0·81. Hence I do not believe that the\r\n       difference between _i_ and unity (for instance, for CaCl_{2}, _i_\r\n       is about 3, for KI about 2, and decreases with the concentration)\r\n       can at present be placed at the basis of any general chemical\r\n       conclusions, and it requires further experimental research. Among\r\n       other methods by which the value of _i_ is now determined for\r\n       dilute solutions is the study of their electroconductivity,\r\n       admitting that _i_ = 1 + _a_(_k_-1), where _a_ = the ratio of the\r\n       molecular conductivity to the limiting conductivity corresponding\r\n       to an infinitely large dilution (_see_ Physical Chemistry), and\r\n       _k_ is the number of ions into which the substance dissolved can\r\n       split up. Without entering upon a criticism of this method of\r\n       determining _i_, I will only remark that it frequently gives\r\n       values of _i_ very close to those found by the depression of the\r\n       freezing point and rise of the boiling point; but that this\r\n       accordance of results is sometimes very doubtful. Thus for a\r\n       solution containing 5·67 grms. CaCl_{2} per 100 grms. of water,\r\n       _i_, according to the vapour tension = 2·52, according to the\r\n       boiling point = 2·71, according to the electroconductivity = 2·28,\r\n       while for solutions in propyl alcohol (Schlamp 1894) _i_ is near\r\n       to 1·33. In a word, although these methods of determining the\r\n       molecular weight of substances in solution show an undoubted\r\n       progress in the general chemical principles of the molecular\r\n       theory, there are still many points which require explanation.\r\n\r\n       We will add certain general relations which apply to these\r\n       problems. Isotonic (Chapter I., Note 19) solutions exhibit not\r\n       only similar osmotic pressures, but also the same vapour tension,\r\n       boiling point and freezing temperature. The osmotic pressure bears\r\n       the same relation to the fall of the vapour tension as the\r\n       specific gravity of a solution does to the specific gravity of the\r\n       vapour of the solvent. The general formulæ underlying the whole\r\n       doctrine of the influence of the molecular weight upon the\r\n       properties of solutions considered above, are: 1. Raoult in\r\n       1886-1890 showed that\r\n\r\n             ((_p_-_p_´)/_p_) × (100/_a_) × (M/_m_) = a constant C\r\n\r\n       where _p_ and _p_´ are the vapour tensions of the solvent and\r\n       substance dissolved, _a_ the amount in grms. of the substance\r\n       dissolved per 100 grms. of solvent, M and _m_ the molecular\r\n       weights of the substance dissolved and solvent. 2. Raoult and\r\n       Recoura in 1890 showed that the constant above C = the ratio of\r\n       the actual vapour density _d_´ of the solvent to the theoretical\r\n       density _d_ calculated according to the molecular weight. This\r\n       deduction may now be considered proved, because both the fall of\r\n       tension and the ratio of the vapour densities _d_´/_d_ give, for\r\n       water 1·03, for alcohol 1·02, for ether 1·04, for bisulphide of\r\n       carbon 1·00, for benzene 1·02, for acetic acid 1·63. 3. By\r\n       applying the principles of thermodynamics and calling L_{1} the\r\n       latent heat of fusion and T_{1} the absolute (= _t_ + 273)\r\n       temperature of fusion of the solvent, and L_{2} and T_{2} the\r\n       corresponding values for the boiling point, Van't Hoff in\r\n       1886-1890 deduced:--\r\n\r\n         (Depression of freezing point)/(Rise of boiling point)\r\n                                    = (L_{2}/L_{1}) × (T_{1}^2/T_{2}^2)\r\n\r\n          Depression of freezing point = (AT_{1}^{2}_a_)/(L_{1}M_{1})\r\n\r\n              Rise of boiling point = (AT_{2}^{2}_a_)/(L_{2}M_{1})\r\n\r\n       where A = 0·01988 (or nearly 0·02 as we took it above), _a_ is\r\n       the weight in grms. of the substance dissolved per 100 grms. of\r\n       the solvent, M_{1} the molecular weight of the dissolved substance\r\n       (in the solution), and M the molecular weight of this substance\r\n       according to its composition and vapour density, then _i_ =\r\n       M/M_{1}. The experimental data and theoretical considerations upon\r\n       which these formulæ are based will be found in text-books of\r\n       physical and theoretical chemistry.\r\n\r\nIf 100 gram-molecules of water, _i.e._ 1,800 grms, be taken and _n_\r\ngram-molecules of sugar, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}, _i.e._ _n_ 342 grms., be\r\ndissolved in them, then the depression _d_, or fall (counting from\r\n0°) of the temperature of the formation of ice will be (according to\r\nPickering)\r\n\r\n          _n_ = 0    0·010    0·025    0·100    0·250    1·000\r\n          _d_ = 0°  0°·0103  0°·0280  0°·1115  0°·2758  1°·1412\r\n\r\nwhich shows that for high degrees of dilution (up to 0·25_n_) _d_\r\napproximately (estimating the possible errors of experiment at ±0°·005)\r\n= _n_1·10, because then _d_ = 0°, 0°·0110, 0°·0275, 0°·1100, 0°·2750,\r\n1°·1000, and the difference between these figures and the results\r\nof experiment for very dilute solutions is less than the possible\r\nerrors of experiment (for _n_ = 1 the difference is already greater)\r\nand therefore for dilute solutions of sugar it may be said that _n_\r\nmolecules of sugar in dissolving in 100 molecules of water give a\r\ndepression of about 1°·1_n_. Similar data for acetone (Chapter I., Note\r\n49) give a depression of 1°·006_n_ for _n_ molecules of acetone per 100\r\nmolecules of water. And in general, for indifferent substances (the\r\nmajority of organic bodies) the depression per 100H_{2}O is _nearly\r\nn_1°·1 to _n_1°·0 (ether, for instance, gives the last number), and\r\nconsequently in dissolving in 100 grms. of water it is about 18°·0_n_\r\nto 19°·0_n_, taking this rule to apply to the case of a small number\r\nof _n_ (not over 0·2_n_). If instead of water, other liquid or fused\r\nsolvents (for example, benzene, acetic acid, acetone, nitrobenzene or\r\nmolten naphthaline, metals, &c.) be taken and in the proportion of 100\r\nmolecules of the solvent to _n_ molecules of a dissolved indifferent\r\n(neither acid nor saline) substance, then the depression is found to be\r\nequal to from 0°·62_n_ to 0°·65_n_ and in general K_n_. If the molecular\r\nweight of the solvent = _m_, then 100 gram-molecules will weigh 100_m_\r\ngrms., and the depression will be approximately (taking 0·63_n_) equal\r\nto _m_0·63_n_ degrees for _n_ molecules of the substance dissolved in\r\n100 grms. of the solvent, or in general the depression for 100 grms.\r\nof a given solvent = _kn_ where _k_ is almost a constant quantity (for\r\nwater nearly 18, for acetone nearly 37, &c.) for all dilute solutions.\r\nThus, having found a convenient solvent for a given substance and\r\nprepared a definite (by weight) solution (_i.e._ knowing how many grms.\r\n_r_ of the solvent there are to _q_ grms. of the substance dissolved)\r\nand having determined the depression _d_--_i.e._ the fall in temperature\r\nof freezing for the solvent--it is possible to determine the molecular\r\nweight of the substance dissolved, because _d_ = _kn_ where _d_ is found\r\nby experiment and _k_ is determined by the nature of the solvent, and\r\ntherefore _n_ or the number of molecules of the substance dissolved can\r\nbe found. But if _r_ grms. of the solvent and _q_ grms. of the substance\r\ndissolved are taken, then there are 100_q_/_r_ of the latter per 100\r\ngrms. of the former, and this quantity = _n_X, where _n_ is found from\r\nthe depression and = _d_/_k_ and X is the molecular weight of the\r\nsubstance dissolved. Hence X = 100_qk_/_rd_, which gives the molecular\r\nweight, naturally only approximately, but still with sufficient accuracy\r\nto easily indicate, for instance, whether in peroxide of hydrogen the\r\nmolecule contains HO or H_{2}O_{2} or H_{3}O_{3}, &c. (H_{2}O_{2} is\r\nobtained). Moreover, attention should be drawn to the fact that a great\r\nmany substances taken as solvents give per 100 molecules a depression of\r\nabout 0·63_n_, whilst water gives about 1·05_n_, _i.e._ a larger\r\nquantity, as though the molecules of liquid water were more complex than\r\nis expressed by the formula H_{2}O.[28] A similar phenomenon which\r\nrepeats itself in the osmotic pressure, vapour tension of the solvent,\r\n&c. (_see_ Chapter I., Notes 19 and 49), _i.e._ a variation of the\r\nconstant (_k_ for 100 grms. of the solvent or K for 100 molecules of it),\r\nis also observed in passing from indifferent substances to saline (to\r\nacids, alkalis and salts) both in aqueous and other solutions as we will\r\nshow (according to Pickering's data 1892) for solutions of NaCl and\r\nCuSO_{4} in water. For\r\n\r\n                    _n_ = 0·01  0·03  0·05  0·1  0·5\r\n\r\nmolecules of NaCl the depression is\r\n\r\n            _d_ = 0°·0177  0°·0598  0°·0992  0°·1958  0°·9544\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds to a depression per molecule\r\n\r\n                    K = 1·77  1·96  1·98  1·96  1·91\r\n\r\n_i.e._ here in the most dilute solutions (when _n_ is nearly 0) _d_ is\r\nobtained about 1·7_n_, while in the case of sugar it was about 1·1_n_.\r\nFor CuSO_{4} for the same values of _n_, experiment gave:\r\n\r\n            _d_ = 0°·0164  0°·0451  0°·0621  0°·1321  0°·5245\r\n              K =  1·64     1·50     1·44     1·32     1·05\r\n\r\n_i.e._ here again _d_ for very dilute solutions is nearly 1·7_n_, but\r\nthe value of K falls as the solution becomes more concentrated, while\r\nfor NaCl it at first increased and only fell for the more concentrated\r\nsolutions. The value of K in the solution of _n_ molecules of a body\r\nin 100H_{2}O, when _d_ = K_n_, for very dilute solutions of CaCl_{2}\r\nis nearly 2·6, for Ca(NO_{3})_{2} nearly 2·5, for HNO_{3}, KI and KHO\r\nnearly 1·9-2·O, for borax Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} nearly 3·7, &c., while for\r\nsugar and similar substances it is, as has been already mentioned,\r\nnearly 1·0-1·1. Although these figures are very different[28 bis] still\r\n_k_ and K may be considered constant for analogous substances, and\r\ntherefore the weight of the molecule of the body in solution can be\r\nfound from _d_. And as the vapour tension of solutions and their boiling\r\npoints (_see_ Note 27 bis and Chapter I., Note 51) vary in the same\r\nmanner as the freezing point depression, so they also may serve as means\r\nfor determining the molecular weight of a substance in solution.[29]\r\n\r\n  [28] A similar conclusion respecting the molecular weight of liquid\r\n       water (_i.e._ that its molecule in a liquid state is more\r\n       complex than in a gaseous state, or polymerized into H_{8}O_{4},\r\n       H_{6}O_{3} or in general into _n_H_{2}O) is frequently met\r\n       in chemico-physical literature, but as yet there is no basis\r\n       for its being fully admitted, although it is possible that a\r\n       polymerization or aggregation of several molecules into one\r\n       takes place in the passage of water into a liquid or solid\r\n       state, and that there is a converse depolymerization in the\r\n       act of evaporation. Recently, particular attention has been\r\n       drawn to this subject owing to the researches of Eötvös (1886)\r\n       and Ramsay and Shields (1893) on the variation of the surface\r\n       tension N with the temperature (N = the capillary constant _a_^2\r\n       multiplied by the specific gravity and divided by 2, for example,\r\n       for water at 0° and 100° the value of _a_^2 = 15·41 and 12·58\r\n       sq. mm., and the surface tension 7·92 and 6·04). Starting from\r\n       the absolute boiling point (Chapter II., Note 29) and adding 6°,\r\n       as was necessary from all the data obtained, and calling this\r\n       temperature T, it is found that AS = _k_T, where S is the surface\r\n       of a gram-molecule of the liquid (if M is its weight in grams,\r\n       _s_ its sp. gr., then its sp. volume = M/_s_, and the surface\r\n       S = [3root](M/_s_)^2), A the surface tension (determined by\r\n       experiment at T), and _k_ a constant which is independent of\r\n       the composition of the molecule. The equation AS = _k_T is in\r\n       complete agreement with the well-known equation for gases _vp_\r\n       = RT (p. 140) which serves for deducing the molecular weight\r\n       from the vapour density. Ramsay's researches led him to the\r\n       conclusion that the liquid molecules of CS_{2}, ether, benzene,\r\n       and of many other substances, have the same value as in a state\r\n       of vapour, whilst with other liquids this is not the case, and\r\n       that to obtain an accordance, that is, that _k_ shall be a\r\n       constant, it is necessary to assume the molecular weight in the\r\n       liquid state to be _n_ times as great. For the fatty alcohols and\r\n       acids _n_ varies from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2, for water from 2-1/4 to 4,\r\n       according to the temperature (at which the depolymerization takes\r\n       place). Hence, although this subject offers a great theoretical\r\n       interest, it cannot be regarded as firmly established, the more\r\n       so since the fundamental observations are difficult to make and\r\n       not sufficiently numerous; should, however, further experiments\r\n       confirm the conclusions arrived at by Professor Ramsay, this will\r\n       give another method of determining molecular weights.\r\n\r\n  [28 bis] Their variance is expressed in the same manner as was done by\r\n       Van't Hoff (Chapter I., Notes 19 and 49) by the quantity _i_,\r\n       taking it as = 1 when _k_ = 1·05, in that case for KI, _i_ is\r\n       nearly 2, for borax about 4, &c.\r\n\r\n  [29] We will cite one more example, showing the direct dependence of\r\n       the properties of a substance on the molecular weight. If one\r\n       molecular part by weight of the various chlorides--for instance,\r\n       of sodium, calcium, barium, &c.--be dissolved in 200 molecular\r\n       parts by weight of water (for instance, in 3,600 grams) then\r\n       it is found that the greater the molecular weight of the salt\r\n       dissolved, the greater is the specific gravity of the resultant\r\n       solution.\r\n\r\n                  Molecular    Sp. gr.                Molecular   Sp. gr.\r\n                   weight       at 15°                 weight      at 15°\r\n         HCl         36·5       1·0041       CaCl_{2}   111        1·0236\r\n         NaCl        58·5       1·0106       NiCl_{2}   130        1·0328\r\n         KCl         74·5       1·0121       ZnCl_{2}   136        1·0331\r\n         BeCl_{2}    80         1·0138       BaCl_{2}   208        1·0489\r\n         MgCl_{2}    95         1·0203\r\n\r\nThus not only in vapours and gases, but also in dilute solutions\r\nof solid and liquid substances, we see that if not all, still many\r\nproperties are wholly dependent upon the molecular weight and not upon\r\nthe quality of a substance, and that this gives the possibility of\r\ndetermining the weight of molecules by studying these properties (for\r\ninstance, the vapour density, depression of the freezing point, &c.) It\r\nis apparent from the foregoing that the physical and even more so the\r\nchemical properties of homogeneous substances, more especially solid and\r\nliquid, do not depend exclusively upon the weights of their molecules,\r\nbut that many are in definite (_see_ Chapter XV.) dependence upon the\r\nweights of the atoms of the elements entering into their composition,\r\nand are determined by their quantitative and individual peculiarities.\r\nThus the density of solids and liquids (as will afterwards be shown) is\r\nchiefly determined by the weights of the atoms of the elements entering\r\ninto their composition, inasmuch as dense elements (in a free state) and\r\ncompounds are only met with among substances containing elements with\r\nlarge atomic weights, such as gold, platinum, and uranium. And these\r\nelements themselves, in a free state, are the heaviest of all elements.\r\nSubstances containing such light elements as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen\r\nand nitrogen (like many organic substances) never have a high specific\r\ngravity; in the majority of cases it scarcely exceeds that of water. The\r\ndensity generally decreases with the increase of the amount of hydrogen,\r\nas the lightest element, and a substance is often obtained lighter than\r\nwater. The refractive power of substances also entirely depends on the\r\ncomposition and the properties of the component elements.[29 bis] The\r\nhistory of chemistry presents a striking example in point--Newton\r\nforesaw from the high refractive index of the diamond that it would\r\ncontain a combustible substance since so many combustible oils have a\r\nhigh refractive power. We shall afterwards see (Chapter XV.) that many\r\nof those properties of substances which are in direct dependence not\r\nupon the weight of the molecules but upon their composition, or, in\r\nother words, upon the properties and quantities of the elements entering\r\ninto them, stand in a peculiar (periodic) dependence upon the atomic\r\nweight of the elements; that is, the mass (of molecules and atoms),\r\nproportional to the weight, determines the properties of substances\r\nas it also determines (with the distance) the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n  [29 bis] With respect to the optical refractive power of substances, it\r\n       must first be observed that the coefficient of refraction is\r\n       determined by two methods: (_a_) either all the data are referred\r\n       to one definite ray--for instance, to the Fraunhofer (sodium) line\r\n       D of the solar spectrum--that is, to a ray of definite wave\r\n       length, and often to that red ray (of the hydrogen spectrum) whose\r\n       wave length is 656 millionths of a millimetre; (_b_) or Cauchy's\r\n       formula is used, showing the relation between the coefficient of\r\n       refraction and dispersion to the wave length _n_ = A +\r\n       (B/([Greek: l]^2)), where A and B are two constants varying for\r\n       every substance but constant for all rays of the spectrum, and\r\n       [Greek: l] is the wave length of that ray whose coefficient of\r\n       refraction is _n_. In the latter method the investigation usually\r\n       concerns the magnitudes of A, which are independent of dispersion.\r\n       We shall afterwards cite the data, investigated by the first\r\n       method, by which Gladstone, Landolt, and others established the\r\n       conception of the refraction equivalent.\r\n\r\n       It has long been known that the _coefficient of refraction n_\r\n       for a given substance decreases with the density of a substance D,\r\n       so that the magnitude (_n_-1) ÷ D = C is almost constant for a\r\n       given ray (having a definite wave length) and for a given\r\n       substance. This constant is called the _refractive energy_, and\r\n       its product with the atomic or molecular weight of a substance the\r\n       _refraction equivalent_. The coefficient of refraction of oxygen\r\n       is 1·00021, of hydrogen 1·00014, their densities (referred to\r\n       water) are 0·00143 and 0·00009, and their atomic weights, O = 16,\r\n       H = 1; hence their refraction equivalents are 3 and 1·5. Water\r\n       contains H_{2}O, consequently the sum of the equivalents of\r\n       refraction is (2 × 1·5) + 3 = 6. But as the coefficient of\r\n       refraction of water = 1·331, its refraction equivalent = 5·958, or\r\n       nearly 6. Comparison shows that, approximately, the sum of the\r\n       refraction equivalents of the atoms forming compounds (or\r\n       mixtures) is equal to the refraction equivalent of the compound.\r\n       According to the researches of Gladstone, Landolt, Hagen, Brühl\r\n       and others, the refraction equivalents of the elements are--H =\r\n       1·3, Li = 3·8, B = 4·0, C = 5·0, N = 4·1 (in its highest state of\r\n       oxidation, 5·3), O = 2·9, F = 1·4, Na = 4·8, Mg = 7·0, Al = 8·4,\r\n       Si = 6·8, P = 18·3, S = 16·0, Cl = 9·9, K = 8·1, Ca = 10·4, Mn =\r\n       12·2, Fe = 12·0 (in the salts of its higher oxides, 20·1), Co =\r\n       10·8, Cu = 11·6, Zn = 10·2, As = 15·4, Bi = 15·3, Ag = 15·7, Cd =\r\n       13·6, I = 24·5, Pt = 26·0, Hg = 20·2, Pb = 24·8, &c. The\r\n       refraction equivalents of many elements could only be calculated\r\n       from the solutions of their compounds. The composition of a\r\n       solution being known it is possible to calculate the refraction\r\n       equivalent of one of its component parts, those for all its other\r\n       components being known. The results are founded on the acceptance\r\n       of a law which cannot be strictly applied. Nevertheless the\r\n       representation of the refraction equivalents gives an easy means\r\n       for directly, although only approximately, obtaining the\r\n       coefficient of refraction from the chemical composition of a\r\n       substance. For instance, the composition of carbon bisulphide is\r\n       CS_{2} = 76, and from its density, 1·27, we find its coefficient\r\n       of refraction to be 1·618 (because the refraction equivalent = 5 +\r\n       2 × 16 = 37), which is very near the actual figure. It is evident\r\n       that in the above representation compounds are looked on as simple\r\n       mixtures of atoms, and the physical properties of a compound as\r\n       the sum of the properties present in the elementary atoms forming\r\n       it. If this representation of the presence of simple atoms in\r\n       compounds had not existed, the idea of combining by a few figures\r\n       a whole mass of data relating to the coefficient of refraction of\r\n       different substances could hardly have arisen. For further details\r\n       on this subject, see works on _Physical Chemistry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                       CARBON AND THE HYDROCARBONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to clearly distinguish between the two closely-allied\r\nterms, charcoal and carbon. Charcoal is well known to everybody,\r\nalthough it is no easy matter to obtain it in a chemically pure state.\r\nPure charcoal is a simple, insoluble, infusible, combustible substance\r\nproduced by heating organic matter, and has the familiar aspect of\r\na black mass, devoid of any crystalline structure, and completely\r\ninsoluble. Charcoal is a substance possessing a peculiar combination\r\nof physical and chemical properties. This substance, whilst in a state\r\nof ignition, combines directly with oxygen; in organic substances it\r\nis found in combination with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur.\r\nBut in all these combinations there is no real charcoal, as in the same\r\nsense there is no ice in steam. What is found in such combinations\r\nis termed 'carbon'--that is, an element common to charcoal, to those\r\nsubstances which can be formed from it, and also to those substances\r\nfrom which it can be obtained. Carbon may take the form of charcoal, but\r\noccurs also as diamond and as graphite. Truly no other element has such\r\na wide terminology. Oxygen is always called 'oxygen,' whether it is in a\r\nfree gaseous state, or in the form of ozone, or oxygen in water, or in\r\nnitric acid or in carbonic anhydride. But here there is some confusion.\r\nIn water it is evident that there is no oxygen in a gaseous form, such\r\nas can be obtained in a free state, no oxygen in the form of ozone, but\r\na substance which is capable of producing both oxygen, ozone, and water.\r\nAs an element, oxygen possesses a known chemical individuality, and an\r\ninfluence on the properties of those combinations into which it enters.\r\nHydrogen gas is a substance which reacts with difficulty, but the\r\nelement hydrogen represents in its combinations an easily displaceable\r\ncomponent part. Carbon may be considered as an atom of carbon matter,\r\nand charcoal as a collection of such atoms forming a whole substance,\r\nor mass of molecules of the substance. The accepted atomic weight\r\nof carbon is 12, because that is the least quantity of carbon which\r\nenters into combination in molecules of its compounds; but the weight\r\nof the molecules of charcoal is probably very much greater. This weight\r\nremains unknown because charcoal is capable of but few direct reactions\r\nand those only at a high temperature (when the weight of its molecules\r\nprobably changes, as when ozone changes into oxygen), and it does not\r\nturn into vapour. Carbon exists in nature, both in a free and combined\r\nstate, in most varied forms and aspects. Carbon in a free state is\r\nfound in at least three different forms, as charcoal, graphite, and the\r\ndiamond. In a combined state it enters into the composition of what are\r\ncalled organic substances--a multitude of substances which are found in\r\nall plants and animals. It exists as carbonic anhydride both in air and\r\nin water, and in the soil and crust of the earth as salts of carbonic\r\nacid and as organic remains.\r\n\r\nThe variety of the substances of which the structure of plants and\r\nanimals is built up is familiar to all. Wax, oil, turpentine, and\r\ntar, cotton and albumin, the tissue of plants and the muscular fibre\r\nof animals, vinegar and starch, are all vegetable and animal matters,\r\nand all carbon compounds.[1] The class of carbon compounds is so vast\r\nthat it forms a separate branch of chemistry, known under the name of\r\norganic chemistry--that is, the chemistry of carbon compounds, or, more\r\nstrictly, of the hydrocarbons and their derivatives.\r\n\r\n  [1] Wood is the non-vital part of ligneous plants: the vital part of\r\n      ordinary trees is situated between the bark and the lignin. Every\r\n      year a layer of lignin is deposited on this part by the juices\r\n      which are absorbed by the roots and drawn up by the leaves; for\r\n      this reason the age of trees may be determined by the number of\r\n      lignin layers deposited. The woody matter consists principally\r\n      of fibrous tissue on to which the lignin or so-called incrusting\r\n      matter has been deposited. The tissue has the composition\r\n      C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, the substance deposited on it contains more\r\n      carbon and hydrogen and less oxygen. This matter is saturated\r\n      with moisture when the wood is in a fresh state. Fresh birch wood\r\n      contains about 31 p.c. of water, lime wood 47 p.c., oak 35 p.c.,\r\n      pine and fir about 37 p.c. When dried in the air the wood loses a\r\n      considerable quantity of water and not more than 19 p.c. remains.\r\n      By artificial means this loss of water may be increased. If water\r\n      be driven into the pores of wood the latter becomes heavier than\r\n      water, as the lignin of which it is composed has a density of\r\n      about 1·6. One cubic centimetre of birch wood does not weigh more\r\n      than 0·901 gram, fir 0·894, lime tree 0·817, poplar 0·765 when\r\n      in a fresh state; when in a dry state birch weighs 0·622, pine\r\n      0·550, fir 0·355, lime 0·430, guaiacum 1·342, ebony 1·226. On one\r\n      hectare (2·7 acres) of woodland the yearly growth averages the\r\n      amount of 3,000 kilograms (or about 3 tons) of wood, but rarely\r\n      reaches as much as 5,000 kilos. The average chemical composition\r\n      of wood dried in air may be expressed as follows:--Hygroscopic\r\n      water 15 p.c., carbon 42 p.c., hydrogen 5 p.c., oxygen and\r\n      nitrogen 37 p.c., ash 1 p.c. Wood parts with its hygroscopic water\r\n      at 150°, and decomposes at about 300°, giving a brown, brittle,\r\n      so-called red charcoal; above 350° black charcoal is produced.\r\n      As the hydrogen contained in wood requires for its combustion\r\n      about forty parts by weight of oxygen, which is present to the\r\n      amount of about 36 p.c., all that burns of the wood is the carbon\r\n      which it contains, 100 parts of wood only giving out as much heat\r\n      as forty parts of charcoal, and therefore it would be far more\r\n      profitable to use charcoal for heating purposes than wood, if it\r\n      were possible to obtain it in such quantities as correspond with\r\n      its percentage ratio--that is forty parts per 100 parts of wood.\r\n      Generally, however, the quantity produced is far less, not more\r\n      than 30 p.c., because part of the carbon is given off as gas, tar,\r\n      &c. If wood has to be transported great distances, or if it is\r\n      necessary to obtain a very high temperature by burning it, then\r\n      even as little as 25 p.c. of charcoal from 100 parts of wood may be\r\n      advantageous. Charcoal (from wood) develops on burning 8,000 heat\r\n      units, whilst wood dried in air does not develop more than 2,800\r\n      units of heat; therefore seven parts of charcoal give as much heat\r\n      as twenty parts of wood. As regards the temperature of combustion,\r\n      it is far higher with charcoal than with wood, because twenty parts\r\n      of burning wood give, besides the carbonic anhydride which is also\r\n      formed together with charcoal, eleven parts of water, the\r\n      evaporation of which requires a considerable amount of heat.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Apparatus for the dry distillation of\r\n      wood. The retort _a_ containing the wood is heated by the flues _c\r\n      e_. The steam and volatile products of distillation pass along the\r\n      tube g through the condenser _m_, where they are condensed. The\r\n      form, distribution, and dimensions of the apparatus vary.]\r\n\r\n      The composition of the growing parts of plants, the leaves, young\r\n      branches, shoots, &c., differs from the composition of the wood\r\n      in that these vital parts contain a considerable quantity of sap\r\n      which contains much nitrogenous matter (in the wood itself there\r\n      is very little), mineral salts, and a large amount of water.\r\n      Taking, for example, the composition of clover and pasture hay in\r\n      the green and dry state; in 100 parts of green clover there is\r\n      about 80 p.c. of water and 20 p.c. of dry matter, in which there\r\n      are about 3·5 parts of nitrogenous albuminous matter, about 9·5\r\n      parts of soluble and about 5 parts of insoluble non-nitrogenous\r\n      matter, and about 2 p.c. of ash. In dry clover or clover-hay there\r\n      is about 15 p.c. of water, 13 p.c. of nitrogenous matter, and 7\r\n      p.c. of ash. This composition of grassy substances shows that they\r\n      are capable of forming the same sort of charcoal as wood itself.\r\n      It also shows the difference of nutritive properties existing\r\n      between wood and the substances mentioned. These latter serve as\r\n      food for animals, because they contain those substances which are\r\n      capable of being dissolved (entering into the blood) and forming\r\n      the body of animals; such substances are proteids, starch, &c. Let\r\n      us remark here that with a good harvest an acre of land gives in\r\n      the form of grass as much organic substance as it yields in the\r\n      form of wood.\r\n\r\n      One hundred parts of dry wood are capable of giving, on dry\r\n      distillation, besides 25 p.c. of charcoal and 10 p.c. or more of\r\n      tar, 40 p.c. of watery liquid, containing acetic acid and wood\r\n      spirit, and about 25 p.c. of gases, which may be used for heating\r\n      or lighting purposes, because they do not differ from ordinary\r\n      illuminating gas, which can indeed be obtained from wood. As\r\n      wood-charcoal and tar are valuable products, in some cases the\r\n      dry distillation of wood is carried on principally for producing\r\n      them. For this purpose those kinds of woods are particularly\r\n      advantageous which contain resinous substances, especially\r\n      coniferous trees, such as fir, pine, &c.; birch, oak, and ash\r\n      give much less tar, but on the other hand they yield more aqueous\r\n      liquor. The latter is used for the manufacture of wood spirit,\r\n      CH_{4}O, and acetic acid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}. In such cases, the\r\n      dry distillation is carried on in stills. The stills are nothing\r\n      more than horizontal or vertical cylindrical retorts, made of\r\n      boiler plate, heated with fuel and having apertures at the top\r\n      and sometimes also at the bottom for the exit of the light and\r\n      heavy products of distillation. The dry distillation of wood in\r\n      stoves is carried on in two ways, either by burning a portion of\r\n      the wood inside the stove in order to submit the remainder to dry\r\n      distillation by means of the heat obtained in this manner, or by\r\n      placing the wood in a stove the thin sides of which are surrounded\r\n      with a flue leading from the fuel, placed in a space below.\r\n\r\n      The first method does not give such a large amount of liquid\r\n      products of the dry distillation as the latter. In the latter\r\n      process there is generally an outlet below for emptying out the\r\n      charcoal at the close of the operation. For the dry distillation\r\n      of 100 parts of wood from forty to twenty parts of fuel are used.\r\n\r\n      In the north of Russia wood is so plentiful and cheap that this\r\n      locality is admirably fitted to become the centre of a general\r\n      trade in the products of its dry distillation. Coal (Note 6),\r\n      sea-weed, turf, animal substances (Chapter VI.), &c., are also\r\n      submitted to the process of dry distillation.\r\n\r\nIf any one of these organic compounds be strongly heated without free\r\naccess of air--or, better still, in a vacuum--it decomposes with more or\r\nless facility. If the supply of air be insufficient, or the temperature\r\nbe too low for combustion (_see_ Chapter III.), and if the first\r\nvolatile products of transformation of the organic matter are subjected\r\nto condensation (for example, if the door of a stove be opened), an\r\nimperfect combustion takes place, and smoke, with charcoal or soot,\r\nis formed.[2] The nature of the phenomenon, and the products arising\r\nfrom it, are the same as those produced by heating alone, since that\r\npart which is in a state of combustion serves to heat the remainder of\r\nthe fuel. The decomposition which takes place on heating a compound\r\ncomposed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is as follows:--A part of the\r\nhydrogen is separated in a gaseous state, another part in combination\r\nwith oxygen, and a third part separates in combination with carbon, and\r\nsometimes in combination with carbon and oxygen in the form of gaseous\r\nor volatile products, or, as they are also called, the products of\r\ndry distillation. If the vapours of these products are passed through\r\na strongly heated tube, they are changed again in a similar manner\r\nand finally resolve themselves into hydrogen and charcoal. Altogether\r\nthese various products of decomposition contain a smaller amount of\r\ncarbon than the original organic matter; part of the carbon remains\r\nin a free state, forming charcoal.[3] It remains in that space where\r\nthe decomposition took place, in the shape of the black, infusible,\r\nnon-volatile charcoal familiar to all. The earthy matter and all\r\nnon-volatile substances (ash) forming a part of the organic matter,\r\nremain behind with the charcoal. The tar-like substances, which require\r\na high temperature in order to decompose them, also remain mixed with\r\ncharcoal. If a volatile organic substance, such as a gaseous compound\r\ncontaining oxygen and hydrogen, be taken, the carbon separates on\r\npassing the vapour through a tube heated to a high temperature. Organic\r\nsubstances when burning with an insufficient supply of air give off\r\nsoot--that is, charcoal--proceeding from carbon compounds in a state of\r\nvapour, the hydrogen of which has, by combustion, been converted into\r\nwater; so, for instance, turpentine, naphthalene, and other hydrocarbons\r\nwhich are with difficulty decomposed by heat, easily yield carbon in the\r\nform of soot during combustion. Chlorine and other substances which,\r\nlike oxygen, are capable of taking up hydrogen, and also substances\r\nwhich are capable of taking up water, can also separate carbon from (or\r\nchar) most organic substances.\r\n\r\n  [2] The result of imperfect combustion is not only the loss of a part\r\n      of the fuel and the production of smoke, which in some respects\r\n      is inconvenient and injurious to health, but also a low flame\r\n      temperature, which means that a less amount of heat is transmitted\r\n      to the object heated. Imperfect combustion is not only always\r\n      accompanied by the formation of soot or unburnt particles of\r\n      charcoal, but also by that of carbonic oxide, CO, in the smoke\r\n      (Chapter IX.) which burns, emitting much heat. In works and\r\n      factories where large quantities of fuel are consumed, many\r\n      appliances are adopted to ensure perfect combustion, and to combat\r\n      against such a ruinous practice as the imperfect combustion of\r\n      fuel. The most effective and radical means consists in employing\r\n      combustible gases (producer and water gases), because by their\r\n      aid perfect combustion can be easily realised without a loss of\r\n      heat-producing power and the highest temperature can be reached.\r\n      When solid fuel is used (such as coal, wood, and turf), imperfect\r\n      combustion is most liable to occur when the furnace doors are\r\n      opened for the introduction of fresh fuel. The step furnace may\r\n      often prove a remedy for this defect. In the ordinary furnace\r\n      fresh fuel is placed on the burning fuel, and the products of dry\r\n      distillation of the fresh fuel have to burn at the expense of\r\n      the oxygen remaining uncombined with the burnt fuel. Imperfect\r\n      combustion is observed in this case also from the fact that the\r\n      dry distillation and evaporation of the water of the fresh fuel\r\n      lying on the top of that burnt, lowers the temperature of the\r\n      flame, because part of the heat becomes latent. On this account a\r\n      large amount of smoke (imperfect combustion) is observed when a\r\n      fresh quantity of fuel is introduced into the furnace. This may\r\n      be obviated by constructing the furnace (or managing the stoking)\r\n      in such a way that the products of distillation pass through\r\n      the red-hot charcoal remaining from the burnt fuel. It is only\r\n      necessary in order to ensure this to allow a sufficient quantity\r\n      of air for perfect combustion. All this may be easily attained\r\n      by the use of step fire-bars. The fuel is fed into a hopper and\r\n      falls on to the fire-bars, which are arranged in the form of a\r\n      staircase. The burning charcoal is below, and hence the flame\r\n      formed by the fresh fuel is heated by the contact of the red-hot\r\n      burning charcoal. An air supply through the fire grate, an equal\r\n      distribution of the fuel on the fire-bars (otherwise the air will\r\n      blow through empty spaces and lower the temperature), a proper\r\n      proportion between the supply of air and the chimney draught,\r\n      and a perfect admixture of air with the flame (without an undue\r\n      excess of air), are the means by which we can contend against the\r\n      imperfect combustion of such kinds of fuel as wood, peat, and\r\n      ordinary (smoky) coal. Coke, charcoal, anthracite, burn without\r\n      smoke, because they do not contain hydrogenous substances which\r\n      furnish the products of dry distillation, but imperfect combustion\r\n      may occur with them also; in that case the smoke contains carbonic\r\n      oxide.\r\n\r\n  [3] Under the action of air, organic substances are capable of\r\n      oxidising to such an extent that all the carbon and all the\r\n      hydrogen they contain will be transformed into carbonic anhydride\r\n      and water. The refuse of plants and that of animals are subjected\r\n      to such a change whether they slowly decompose and putrefy, or\r\n      rapidly burn with direct access of air. But if the supply of air\r\n      be limited, there can be no complete transformation into water and\r\n      carbonic anhydride, there will be other volatile matters (rich in\r\n      hydrogen), while charcoal must remain as a non-volatile substance.\r\n      All organic substances are unstable, they do not resist heat, and\r\n      change even at ordinary temperatures, particularly if water be\r\n      present. It is therefore easy to understand that charcoal may in\r\n      many cases be obtained through the transformation of substances\r\n      entering into the composition of organisms, but that it is never\r\n      found in a pure state.\r\n\r\n      However, water and carbonic anhydride are not the only products\r\n      separated from organic substances. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen\r\n      are capable of giving a multitude of compounds; some of these\r\n      are volatile compounds, gaseous, soluble in water--they are\r\n      carried off from organic matter, undergoing change without access\r\n      of air. Others, on the contrary, are non-volatile, rich in\r\n      carbon, unaffected by heat and other agents. The latter remain\r\n      in admixture with charcoal in the place where the decomposition\r\n      takes place; such, for example, are tarry substances. The quantity\r\n      of those bodies which are found mixed with the charcoal is very\r\n      varied, and depends on the energy and duration of the decomposing\r\n      agent. The annexed table shows, according to the data of Violette,\r\n      those changes which wood undergoes at various temperatures when\r\n      submitted to dry distillation by means of superheated steam:--\r\n\r\n        +----------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n        |                 Residue    |                              |\r\n        |Temperature  from 100 parts | In 100 parts of the residual |\r\n        |             of alder wood  |           charcoal           |\r\n        +----------------------------+---------------------+--------+\r\n        |                            |   C     H   O and N |  Ash   |\r\n        |    150°         100·0      | 47·5   6·1   46·3   |  0·1   |\r\n        |    350°          29·7      | 76·6   4·1   18·4   |  0·6   |\r\n        |   1032°          18·7      | 81·9   2·3   14·1   |  1·6   |\r\n        |   1500°          17·3      | 95·0   0·7    3·8   |  1·7   |\r\n        +----------------------------+---------------------+--------+\r\n\r\nWood charcoal is prepared in large quantities in a similar manner--that\r\nis, by the partial combustion of wood.[4] In nature a similar process\r\nof carbonisation of vegetable refuse takes place in its transformation\r\nunder water, as shown by the marshy vegetation which forms peat.[5] In\r\nthis manner doubtless the enormous masses of coal were formed[6] which,\r\nfollowing the example set by England, are now utilised everywhere as\r\nthe principal material for heating steam boilers, and in general for\r\nall purposes of heating and burning.[7] Russia possesses many very\r\nrich coalfields, amongst which the Donetz district is most worthy of\r\nremark.[8]\r\n\r\n  [4] The object of producing charcoal from wood has been explained in\r\n      Note 1. _Wood charcoal_ is obtained in so-called stacks by\r\n      partially burning the wood, or by means of dry distillation (Note\r\n      1) without the access of air. It is principally manufactured for\r\n      metallurgical processes, especially for smelting and forging\r\n      iron. The preparation of charcoal in stacks has one advantage,\r\n      and that is that it may be done on any spot in the forest. But\r\n      in this way all the products of dry distillation are lost.\r\n      For charcoal burning, a pile or stack is generally built, in\r\n      which the logs are placed close together, either horizontally,\r\n      vertically, or inclined, forming a stack of from six to fifty\r\n      feet in diameter and even larger. Under the stack are several\r\n      horizontal air passages, and an opening in the middle to let out\r\n      the smoke. The surface of the stack is covered with earth and\r\n      sods to a considerable thickness, especially the upper part, in\r\n      order to hinder the free passage of air and to concentrate the\r\n      heat inside. When the stack is kindled, the pile begins to settle\r\n      down by degrees, and it is then necessary to look after the turf\r\n      casing and keep it in repair. As the combustion spreads throughout\r\n      the whole pile, the temperature rises and real dry distillation\r\n      commences. It is then necessary to stop the air holes, in order as\r\n      much as possible to prevent unnecessary combustion. The nature of\r\n      the process is, that part of the fuel burns and develops the heat\r\n      required for subjecting the remainder to dry distillation. The\r\n      charring is stopped when the products of dry distillation, which\r\n      are emitted, no longer burn with a brilliant flame, but the pale\r\n      blue flame of carbonic oxide appears. Dry wood in stacks yields\r\n      about one-fourth of its weight of charcoal.\r\n\r\n  [5] When dead vegetable matter undergoes transformation in air, in the\r\n      presence of moisture and lower organisms, there remains a\r\n      substance much richer in carbon--namely, humus, black earth or\r\n      mould. 100 parts of humus in a dry state contain about 70 p.c.\r\n      of carbon. The roots, leaves, and stems of plants which wither\r\n      and fall to the ground form a soil rich in humus. The non-vital\r\n      vegetable substances (ligneous tissue) first form brown matter\r\n      (ulmic compounds), and then black matter (humic substances),\r\n      which are both insoluble in water; after this a brown acid is\r\n      produced, which is soluble in water (apocrenic acid), and lastly\r\n      a colourless acid also soluble in water (crenic acid). Alkali\r\n      dissolves a part of the original brown and black substances,\r\n      forming solutions of a brown tint (ulmic and humic acids) which\r\n      sometimes communicate their colour to springs and rivers. The\r\n      proportion of humus in soil generally has a direct influence on\r\n      its fertility; firstly, because putrefying plants develop carbonic\r\n      anhydride and ammonia, and yield the substances forming the ashes\r\n      of plants, which are necessary to vegetation; secondly, because\r\n      humus is capable of attracting the moisture of the air and of\r\n      absorbing water (twice its weight) and in this way keeps the soil\r\n      in a damp condition, which is indispensable for nourishment;\r\n      thirdly, humus renders the soil porous, and, fourthly, it renders\r\n      it more capable of absorbing the heat of the sun's rays. On this\r\n      account black earth is often most remarkable for its fertility.\r\n      One object of manuring is to increase the quantity of humus in the\r\n      soil, and any easily changeable vegetable or any animal matter\r\n      (composts) may be used. The boundless tracts of black earth soil\r\n      in Russia are capable of bestowing countless wealth on the country.\r\n\r\n      The origin and extent of black earth soil are treated in detail in\r\n      Professor Dokouchaeff's works.\r\n\r\n      If those substances which produce humus undergo decomposition\r\n      under water, less carbonic anhydride is formed, a quantity of\r\n      marsh gas, CH_{4}, is evolved, and the solid residue forms\r\n      an acid humus found in great quantities in marshy places and\r\n      called _peat_. Peat is especially abundant in the lowlands of\r\n      Holland, North Germany, Ireland, and Bavaria. In Russia it is\r\n      likewise found in large quantities, especially in the North-West\r\n      districts. The old hard forms of peat resemble in composition and\r\n      properties brown coal; the newest formations, as yet unhardened\r\n      by pressure, form very porous masses which retain traces of the\r\n      vegetable matter from which they have been formed. Dried (and\r\n      sometimes pressed) peat is used as fuel. The composition of peat\r\n      varies considerably with the locality in which it is found. When\r\n      dried in air it does not contain less than 15 p.c. of water and\r\n      8 p.c. of ash; the remainder consists of 45 p.c. of carbon, 4\r\n      p.c. of hydrogen, 1 p.c. of nitrogen, and 28 p.c. of oxygen. Its\r\n      heating power is about equivalent to that of wood. The brown\r\n      earthy varieties of coal were probably formed from peat. In other\r\n      cases they have a marked woody structure, and are then known as\r\n      lignites. The composition of the brown sorts of coal resembles in\r\n      a marked degree that of peat--namely, in a dried state brown coal\r\n      contains on an average 60 p.c. of carbon, 5 p.c. of hydrogen, 26\r\n      p.c. of oxygen and nitrogen, and 9 p.c. of ash. In Russia brown\r\n      coal is met with in many districts near Moscow, in the Governments\r\n      of Toula and Tver and the neighbourhood; it is very usually used\r\n      as fuel, particularly when found in thick seams. The brown coals\r\n      usually burn with a flame like wood and peat, and are akin to them\r\n      in heating power, which is half or a third that of the best coal.\r\n\r\n  [6] Grass and wood, the vegetation of primæval seas and similar refuse\r\n      of all geological periods, must have been in many cases subjected\r\n      to the same changes they now undergo--that is, under water they\r\n      formed peat and lignites. Such substances, preserved or a long\r\n      time underground, subjected to the action of water, compressed by\r\n      the new strata formed above them, transformed by the separation\r\n      of their more volatile component parts (peat and lignites, even\r\n      in their last condition, still continue to evolve nitrogen,\r\n      carbonic anhydride, and marsh gases) form _coal_. Coal is a\r\n      dense homogeneous mass, black, with an oily or glassy lustre, or\r\n      more rarely dull without any evident vegetable structure; this\r\n      distinguishes it in appearance from the majority of lignites.\r\n      The density of coal (not counting the admixture of pyrites,\r\n      &c.) varies from 1·25 (dry bituminous coal) to 1·6 (anthracite,\r\n      flameless), and even reaches 1·9 in the very dense variety of\r\n      coal found in the Olonetzky government (termed shungite), which\r\n      according to the investigations of Professor Inostrantzeff may be\r\n      regarded as the extreme member of the various forms of coal.\r\n\r\n      In order to explain the formation of coal from vegetable matter,\r\n      Cagniard de la Tour enclosed pieces of dried wood in a tube and\r\n      heated them to the boiling point of mercury, when the wood was\r\n      changed into a semi-liquid black mass from which a substance\r\n      exceedingly like coal separated. In this manner some kinds of\r\n      wood formed coal which on being heated left caking coke, others\r\n      non-caking; precisely as we find with the natural varieties of\r\n      coal. Violette repeated these experiments with wood dried at\r\n      150°, and showed that when wood is decomposed in this way, a\r\n      gas, an aqueous liquor, and a residue are formed. The latter\r\n      at a temperature of 200° has the properties of wood charcoal\r\n      incompletely burnt; at 300° and higher a homogeneous mass like\r\n      coal is formed which at 340° is dense and without cavities. At\r\n      400° the residue resembles anthracite. In nature probably the\r\n      decomposition was in rare cases effected by heat alone; more\r\n      generally it was effected by means of water and heat, but in\r\n      either case the result ought to be almost the same.\r\n\r\n      The average composition of coal compiled from many analyses,\r\n      disregarding the ash, is as follows: 84 parts of carbon, 5 parts\r\n      of hydrogen, 1 part of nitrogen, 8 parts of oxygen, 2 of sulphur.\r\n      The quantity of ash is on an average 5 p.c., but there are coals\r\n      which contain a larger quantity, and naturally they are not so\r\n      advantageous for use as fuel. The amount of water does not usually\r\n      exceed more than 10 p.c. The _anthracites_ form a remarkable\r\n      variety of coals, they do not give any volatile products, or but\r\n      a very small amount, as they contain but little hydrogen compared\r\n      to oxygen. In the average composition of coal we saw that for 5\r\n      parts of hydrogen there were 8 parts of oxygen; therefore 4 parts\r\n      by weight of hydrogen are capable of forming hydrocarbons, because\r\n      1 part of hydrogen is necessary in order to form water with the 8\r\n      parts of oxygen. These 4 parts by weight of hydrogen can convert\r\n      48 parts of carbon into volatile products, because 1 part of\r\n      hydrogen by weight in these substances combines with 12 parts of\r\n      carbon. The anthracites differ essentially from this: neglecting\r\n      the ash, their average composition is as follows: 94 parts of\r\n      carbon, 3 of hydrogen, and 3 of oxygen and nitrogen. According to\r\n      the analyses of A. A. Voskresensky, the Grousheffsky anthracite\r\n      (Don district) contains: C = 93·8, H = 1·7, ash = 1·5. Therefore\r\n      the anthracites contain but little hydrogen capable of combining\r\n      with the carbon to form hydrocarbons which burn with a flame.\r\n      Anthracites are the oldest forms of coal. The newest and least\r\n      transformed coals, which resemble some of the brown varieties, are\r\n      the _dry_ coals. They burn with a flame like wood, and leave a\r\n      coke having the appearance of lumps of coal, half their component\r\n      parts being absorbed by the flame (they contain much hydrogen and\r\n      oxygen). The remaining varieties of coal (gas coal, smithy coal,\r\n      coking, and anthracite) according to Grüner in all respects form\r\n      connecting links between the _dry_ coals and the anthracites.\r\n      These coals burn with a very smoky flame, and on being heated\r\n      leave _coke_, which bears the same relation to coal that charcoal\r\n      does to wood. The quantity and quality of coke vary considerably\r\n      with the different sorts of coal from which it is formed. In\r\n      practice coals are most often distinguished by the properties\r\n      and quantity of the coke which they give. In this particular the\r\n      so-called bituminous coals are especially valuable, as even the\r\n      slack of this kind gives on dry distillation large spongy masses\r\n      of coke. If large pieces of these kinds of coal are subjected\r\n      to dry distillation, they, as it were, melt, flow together, and\r\n      form caking masses of coke. The best coking coals give 65 p.c. of\r\n      dense caking coke. Such coal is very valuable for metallurgical\r\n      purposes (_see_ Note 8). Besides coke, the dry distillation of\r\n      coal produces gas (_see_ further, illuminating gas, p. 361),\r\n      coal-tar (which gives benzene, carbolic acid, naphthalene, tar\r\n      for artificial asphalt, &c.) and also an aqueous alkaline liquor\r\n      (with wood and lignites the liquid is acid from acetic acid) which\r\n      contains ammonium carbonate (_see_ Note 6).\r\n\r\n  [7] In England in 1850 the output of coal was as much as 48 million\r\n      tons, and in latter years it has risen to about 190 millions.\r\n      Besides this other countries contribute 300 millions--Russia about\r\n      6 millions. The United States of America come next to England with\r\n      an output of 160 million tons, then Germany 90 millions; France\r\n      produces but little (25 millions), and takes about 5 million tons\r\n      from England. Thus the world consumes about 500 million tons of\r\n      coal yearly. Besides household purposes, coal is chiefly used as\r\n      fuel for steam-engines. As every horse-power (= 75 kilogrammetres\r\n      per second) of a steam-engine expends on the average more than\r\n      25 kilograms in 24 hours, or in a year (counting stoppages) not\r\n      less than 5 tons per horse-power, and there are not less than 40\r\n      million horse-power at work in the world, the consumption of coal\r\n      for motive-power is at least equal to half the whole production.\r\n      For this reason coal serves as a criterion of the industrial\r\n      development of a country. About 15 p.c. of coal is used for the\r\n      manufacture of cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and articles made\r\n      of them.\r\n\r\n  [8] The principal coal beds of Russia under exploitation are: The Don\r\n      basin (150 million poods per annum, 62 poods = 1 ton), the Polish\r\n      basin (Dombrovo and others 120 million poods per annum), the Toula\r\n      and Riazan beds of the Moscow basin (up to 25 million poods),\r\n      the Ural basin (10 million poods), the Caucasian (Kviboul, near\r\n      Kutais), the Khirjhis steppes, the smithy coal basin (Gov. of\r\n      Tomsk), the Sahaline, &c. The Polish and Moscow basins do not give\r\n      any coking coals. The presence of every variety of coal (from\r\n      the dry coal near Lisichansk on the Donetz to the anthracites of\r\n      the entire south-east basin), the great abundance of excellent\r\n      metallurgical coal (coking, _see_ Note 6) in the western part\r\n      of the basin, its vast extent (as much as 25,000 sq. versts),\r\n      the proximity of the seams to the surface (the shafts are now\r\n      from 20 to 100 fathoms deep, and in England and Belgium as deep\r\n      as 500 fathoms), the fertility of the soil (black earth), the\r\n      proximity of the sea (about 100 versts from the Sea of Azoff) and\r\n      of the rivers Donetz, Don, and Dneiper, the most abundant seams\r\n      of excellent iron ore (Korsan Mogila, Krivoy Rog, Soulin, &c.,\r\n      &c.), copper ore, mercury ore (near Nikitovka, in the Bakhmouth\r\n      district of the Ekaterinoslav Gov.), and other ores, the richest\r\n      probably in the whole world, the beds of rock-salt (near the\r\n      stations of the Stoupka and Brianzovka) the excellent clay of all\r\n      kinds (china, fire-clay), gypsum, slate, sandstone, and other\r\n      _wealth of the Don coal basin_, give complete assurance of the\r\n      fact that with the growth of industrial activity in Russia this\r\n      bountiful land of the Cossacks and New Russia will become the\r\n      centre of the most extensive productive enterprise, not for the\r\n      requirements of Russia alone, but of the whole world, because in\r\n      no other place can be found such a concentration of favourable\r\n      conditions. The growth of enterprise and knowledge, together with\r\n      the extinction of the forests which compels Russia to foster the\r\n      production of coal, will help to bring about this desired result.\r\n      England with a whole fleet of merchant vessels exports annually\r\n      about 25 million tons of coal, the price of which is higher than\r\n      on the Donetz (where a pood of worked coal costs less than 5\r\n      copecks on the average), where anthracites and semi-anthracites\r\n      (like Cardiff or steam coal, which burns without smoke) and coking\r\n      and metallurgical coals are able both in quantity and quality to\r\n      satisfy the most fastidious requirements of the industry already\r\n      existing and rapidly increasing everywhere. The coal mines of\r\n      England and Belgium are approaching a state of exhaustion, whilst\r\n      in those of the Don basin, only at a depth of 100 fathoms,\r\n      1,200,000 million poods of coal lie waiting to be worked.\r\n\r\nDuring the imperfect combustion of volatile substances containing\r\ncarbon and hydrogen, the hydrogen and part of the carbon first burn,\r\nand the remainder of the carbon forms soot. Tar, pitch, and similar\r\nsubstances for this reason burn with a smoky flame. Thus soot is\r\nfinely-divided charcoal separated during the imperfect combustion\r\nof the vapours and gases of carbonaceous substances rich in carbon.\r\nSpecially-prepared soot (lampblack) is very largely used as a black\r\npaint and a large quantity goes for the manufacture of printers' ink. It\r\nis prepared by burning tar, oil, natural gas, naphtha, &c. The quantity\r\nof organic matter remaining undecomposed in the charcoal depends on the\r\ntemperature to which it has been submitted. Charcoal prepared at the\r\nlowest temperature still contains a considerable quantity of hydrogen\r\nand oxygen--even as much as 4 p.c. of hydrogen and 20 p.c. of oxygen.\r\nSuch charcoal still preserves the structure of the substance from\r\nwhich it was obtained. Ordinary charcoal, for instance, in which the\r\nstructure of the tree is still visible, is of this kind. On submitting\r\nit to further heating, a fresh quantity of hydrogen with carbon and\r\noxygen (in the form of gases or volatile matter) may be separated, and\r\nthe purest charcoal will be obtained on submitting it to the greatest\r\nheat.[9] If it be required to prepare pure charcoal from soot it is\r\nnecessary first to wash it with alcohol and ether in order to remove the\r\nsoluble tarry products, and then submit it to a powerful heat to drive\r\noff the impurities containing hydrogen and oxygen. Charcoal however when\r\ncompletely purified does not change in appearance. Its porosity,[10]\r\nbad conducting power for heat, capability of absorbing the luminous\r\nrays (hence its blackness and opacity), and many other qualities, are\r\nfamiliar from everyday experience.[11] The specific gravity of charcoal\r\nvaries from 1·4 to 1·9, and that it floats on water is due to the air\r\ncontained in its pores. If charcoal is reduced to a powder and moistened\r\nwith spirit, it immediately sinks in water. It is _infusible_ in the\r\nfurnace and even at the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame. In the\r\nheat generated by means of a powerful galvanic current charcoal only\r\nsoftens but does not completely melt, and on cooling it is found to\r\nhave undergone a complete change both in properties and appearance,\r\nand is more or less transformed into graphite. The physical stability\r\nof charcoal is without doubt allied to its chemical stability. It\r\nis evidently a substance devoid of energy, for it is insoluble in\r\nall known liquids, and _at an ordinary temperature does not combine\r\nwith anything_; it is an inactive substance, like nitrogen.[12] But\r\nthese properties of charcoal change with a rise of temperature; thus,\r\nunlike nitrogen, charcoal, at a high temperature, combines directly\r\nwith oxygen. This is well known, as charcoal burns in air. Indeed, not\r\nonly does oxygen _combine with charcoal at a red heat_, but sulphur,\r\nhydrogen, silicon, and also iron and some other metals[12 bis] do\r\nso at a very high temperature--that is, when the molecules of the\r\ncharcoal have reached a state of great instability--whilst at ordinary\r\ntemperatures neither oxygen, sulphur, nor metals act on charcoal in\r\nany way. When burning in oxygen, charcoal forms carbonic anhydride,\r\nCO_{2}, whilst in the vapours of sulphur, carbon bisulphide, CS_{2}, is\r\nformed, and wrought iron, when acted on by carbon, becomes cast iron.\r\nAt the great heat obtained by passing the galvanic current through\r\ncarbon electrodes, charcoal combines with hydrogen, forming acetylene,\r\nC_{2}H_{2}. Charcoal does not combine directly with nitrogen, but in the\r\npresence of metals and alkaline oxides, nitrogen is absorbed, forming\r\na metallic cyanide, as, for instance, potassium cyanide, KCN. From\r\nthese few direct combinations which charcoal is capable of entering\r\ninto, may be derived those numerous carbonaceous compounds which enter\r\ninto the composition of plants and animals, and can be thus obtained\r\nartificially. Certain substances containing oxygen give up a part of\r\nit to charcoal at a relatively low temperature. For instance, nitric\r\nacid when boiled with charcoal gives carbonic anhydride and nitric\r\nperoxide. Sulphuric acid is reduced to sulphurous anhydride when heated\r\nwith carbon. When heated to redness charcoal absorbs oxygen from a large\r\nnumber of the oxides. Even such oxides as those of sodium and potassium,\r\nwhen heated to redness, yield their oxygen to charcoal although they\r\ndo not part with it to hydrogen. Only a few of the oxides, like silica\r\n(oxide of silicon) and lime (calcium oxide) resist the reducing\r\naction of charcoal. Charcoal is capable of changing its physical\r\ncondition without undergoing any alteration in its essential chemical\r\nproperties--that is, it passes into _isomeric_ or _allotropic forms_.\r\nThe two other particular forms in which carbon appears are the _diamond_\r\nand _graphite_. The identity of composition of these with charcoal is\r\nproved by burning an equal quantity of all three separately in oxygen\r\n(at a very high temperature), when each gives the same quantity of\r\ncarbonic anhydride--namely, 12 parts of charcoal, diamond, or graphite\r\nin a pure state, yield on burning 44 parts by weight of carbonic\r\nanhydride. The physical properties present a marked contrast; the\r\ndensest sorts of charcoal have a density of only 1·9, whilst the density\r\nof graphite is about 2·3, and that of the diamond 3·5. A great many\r\nother properties depend on the density, for instance combustibility.\r\nThe lighter charcoal is, the more easily it burns; graphite burns with\r\nconsiderable difficulty even in oxygen, and the diamond burns only\r\nin oxygen and at a very high temperature. On burning, charcoal, the\r\ndiamond, and graphite develop different quantities of heat. One part by\r\nweight of wood charcoal converted by burning into carbonic anhydride\r\ndevelops 8,080 heat units; dense charcoal separated in gas retorts\r\ndevelops 8,050 heat units; natural graphite, 7,800 heat units; and the\r\ndiamond 7,770. The greater the density the less the heat evolved by the\r\ncombustion of the carbon.[13]\r\n\r\n  [9] As it is difficult to separate from the charcoal the admixture of\r\n      ash--that is, the earthy matter contained in the vegetable\r\n      substance used for producing charcoal--in order to obtain it\r\n      in its purest condition it is necessary to use such organic\r\n      substances as do not contain any ash, for example completely\r\n      refined or purified crystallised sugar, crystallised tartaric\r\n      acid, &c.\r\n\r\n  [10] The cavities in charcoal are the passages through which those\r\n       volatile products formed at the same time as the charcoal have\r\n       passed. The degree of porosity of charcoal varies considerably,\r\n       and has a technical significance, in different kinds of charcoal.\r\n       The most porous charcoal is very light; a cubic metre of wood\r\n       charcoal weighs about 200 kilograms. Many of the properties of\r\n       charcoal which depend exclusively on its porosity are shared by\r\n       many other porous substances, and vary with the density of the\r\n       charcoal and depend on the way it was prepared. The property\r\n       which charcoal has of absorbing gases, liquids, and many\r\n       substances in solution, is a case in point. The densest kind\r\n       of charcoal is formed by the action of great heat on sugar and\r\n       other fusible substances. The lustrous grey dense coke formed in\r\n       gas retorts is also of this character. This dense coke collects\r\n       on the internal walls of the retorts subjected to great heat,\r\n       and is produced by the vapours and gases separated from the\r\n       heated coal in the retorts. In virtue of its density such coke\r\n       becomes a good conductor of the galvanic current and approaches\r\n       graphite. It is principally used in galvanic batteries. Coke, or\r\n       the charcoal remaining from the imperfect combustion of coal and\r\n       tarry substances, is also but slightly porous, brilliant, does\r\n       not soil or mark paper, is dense, almost devoid of the faculty\r\n       of retaining liquids and solids, and does not absorb gases. The\r\n       light sorts of charcoal produced from charred wood, on the other\r\n       hand, show this absorptive power in a most marked degree. This\r\n       property is particularly developed in that very fine and friable\r\n       charcoal prepared by heating animal substances such as hides and\r\n       bones. _The absorptive power of charcoal_ for gases is similar\r\n       to the condensation of gases in spongy platinum. Here evidently\r\n       there is a case of the adherence of gases to a solid, precisely\r\n       as liquids have the property of adhering to various solids. One\r\n       volume of charcoal will absorb the following volumes of gases\r\n       (charcoal is capable of absorbing an immense amount of chlorine,\r\n       almost equal to its own weight):--\r\n\r\n         --------------------------------------------------------\r\n              Saussure.

The quantity\r\n       of heat given out by the absorption nearly approaches that set\r\n       free on dissolving, or passing into a liquid condition.\r\n\r\n       Charcoal absorbs not only gases, but a number of other\r\n       substances. For instance, alcohol which contains disagreeably\r\n       smelling fusel oil, on being mixed with charcoal or filtered\r\n       through it, loses most of the fusel oil. The practice of\r\n       filtering substances through charcoal in order to get rid of\r\n       foreign matters is often applied in chemical and manufacturing\r\n       processes. Oils, spirits, various extracts, and vegetable and\r\n       other solutions are filtered through charcoal in order to purify\r\n       them. The bleaching power of charcoal may be tested by using\r\n       various coloured solutions--such as aniline dyes, litmus, &c.\r\n       Charcoal, which has absorbed one substance to saturation is still\r\n       capable of absorbing certain other substances. Animal charcoal,\r\n       produced in a very finely-divided state, especially by heating\r\n       bones, makes the best sort for the purposes of absorption. Bone\r\n       charcoal is used in large quantities in sugar works for filtering\r\n       syrups and all saccharine solutions, in order to purify them,\r\n       not only from colouring and odorous matter, but also from the\r\n       lime which is mixed with the syrups in order to render them\r\n       less unstable during boiling. The absorption of lime by animal\r\n       charcoal depends, in all probability, in a great degree on the\r\n       mineral component parts of bone charcoal.\r\n\r\n  [11] Charcoal is a very bad conductor of heat, and therefore forms an\r\n       excellent insulator or packing to prevent the transmission of\r\n       heat. A charcoal lining is often used in crucibles for heating\r\n       many substances, as it does not melt and resists a far greater\r\n       heat than many other substances.\r\n\r\n  [12] The unalterability of charcoal under the action of atmospheric\r\n       agencies, which produce changes in the majority of stony and\r\n       metallic substances, is often made use of in practice. For\r\n       example, charcoal is frequently strewn in boundary ditches. The\r\n       surface of wood is often charred to render it durable in those\r\n       places where the soil is damp and wood itself would soon rot. The\r\n       chambers (or in some works towers) through which acids pass (for\r\n       example, sulphuric and hydrochloric) in order to bring them into\r\n       contact with gases or liquids, are filled with charcoal or coke,\r\n       because at ordinary temperatures it resists the action of even\r\n       the strongest acids.\r\n\r\n  [12 bis] Maquenne (1892) discovered that carbon is capable of combining\r\n       with the alkali metals. A 20 p.c. amalgam of the metals was heated\r\n       to a red heat with charcoal powder in a stream of hydrogen. The\r\n       compounds so obtained possessed, after the mercury had been driven\r\n       off, the compositions BaC_{2}, SrC_{2}, CaC_{2}. All these\r\n       compounds react with water forming acetylene, for example:\r\n\r\n             BaC_{2} + 2H_{2}O = C_{2}H_{2} + Ba(OH)_{2}\r\n\r\n       Maquenne proposes the barium carbide as a source of acetylene. He\r\n       obtained this compound by heating carbonate of barium, magnesium\r\n       powder, and retort carbon in a Perreau furnace (BaCO_{3} + 3Mg + C\r\n       = 3MgO + BaC_{2}). One hundred grams of BaC_{2} evolve 5,200 to\r\n       5,400 c.c. of acetylene, mixed with about 2-3 p.c. of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n       The relation of acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, to these metallic carbides\r\n       is evident from the fact that these metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) replace 2\r\n       atoms of hydrogen, and therefore C_{2}Ba corresponds to\r\n       C_{2}H_{2}, so that they may be regarded as metallic derivatives\r\n       of acetylene. Moissan (1893) obtained similar carbides directly\r\n       from the oxides by subjecting them to the action of the voltaic\r\n       arc, in the presence of carbon, for instance, BaO + 3C = CO +\r\n       C_{2}Ba, although at a furnace heat carbon has no action on the\r\n       oxides CaO, BaO, SrO. Concerning Al_{4}C_{5}, _see_ Chapter XVII.\r\n       Note 38.\r\n\r\n  [13] When subjected to pressure, charcoal loses heat, hence the densest\r\n       form stands to the less dense as a solid to a liquid, or as a\r\n       compound to an element. From this the conclusion may be drawn\r\n       that the molecules of graphite are more complex than those of\r\n       charcoal, and those of the diamond still more so. The specific\r\n       heat shows the same variation, and as we shall see further on,\r\n       the increased complexity of a molecule leads to a diminution of\r\n       the specific heat. At ordinary temperatures the specific heat of\r\n       charcoal is 0·24, graphite 0·20, the diamond 0·147. For retort\r\n       carbon Le Chatelier (1893) found that the product of the sp. heat\r\n       and atomic weight varies, between 0° and 250°, according to the\r\n       formula: = 1·92 + 0·0077_t_, and between 250° and 1000°, = 3·54 +\r\n       0·00246_t_ (_see_ Chapter XIV. Note 4).\r\n\r\nBy means of intense heat charcoal may be transformed into graphite.\r\nIf a charcoal rod 4 mm. in diameter and 5 mm. long be enclosed in an\r\nexhausted receiver and the current from 600 Bunsen's elements, placed\r\nin parallel series of 100, be passed through it, the charcoal becomes\r\nstrongly incandescent, partially volatilises, and is deposited in the\r\nform of graphite. If sugar be placed in a charcoal crucible and a\r\npowerful galvanic current passed through it, it is baked into a mass\r\nsimilar to graphite. If charcoal be mixed with wrought iron and heated,\r\ncast iron is formed, which contains as much as five per cent. of\r\ncharcoal. If molten cast iron be suddenly chilled, the carbon remains in\r\ncombination with the iron, forming so called white cast iron; but if the\r\ncooling proceeds slowly, the greater part of the carbon separates in the\r\nform of graphite, and if such cast iron (so called grey cast iron) be\r\ndissolved in acid, the carbon remains in the form of graphite. Graphite\r\nis met with in nature, sometimes in the form of large compact masses,\r\nsometimes permeating rocky formations like the schists or slates, and\r\nin fact is met with in those places which, in all probability, have\r\nbeen subjected to the action of subterranean heat.[14] The graphite in\r\ncast iron, and sometimes also natural graphite, occasionally appears in\r\na crystalline form in the shape of six-sided plates, but more often it\r\noccurs as a compact amorphous mass having the characteristic properties\r\nof the familiar black-lead pencil.[15]\r\n\r\n  [14] There are places where anthracite gradually changes into graphite\r\n       as the strata sink. I myself had the opportunity of observing\r\n       this gradual transformation in the valley of Aosta.\r\n\r\n  [15] Pencils are made of graphite worked up into a homogeneous mass by\r\n       disintegrating, powdering, and cleansing it from earthy\r\n       impurities; the best kinds are made of completely homogeneous\r\n       graphite sawn up into the requisite sticks. Graphite is found in\r\n       many places. In Russia the so-called Aliberoffsky graphite is\r\n       particularly renowned; it is found in the Altai mountains near\r\n       the Chinese frontier; in many places in Finland and likewise\r\n       on the banks of the Little Tungouska, Sidoroff also found a\r\n       considerable quantity of graphite. When mixed with clay, graphite\r\n       is used for making crucibles and pots for melting metals.\r\n\r\n       Graphite, like most forms of charcoal, still contains a certain\r\n       quantity of hydrogen, oxygen, and ash, so that in its natural\r\n       state it does not contain more than 98 _p.c._ of carbon.\r\n\r\n       In practice, graphite is purified simply by washing it when in\r\n       a finely-ground state, by which means the bulk of the earthy\r\n       matter may be separated. The following process, proposed by\r\n       Brodie, consists in mixing the powdered graphite with 1/14 part\r\n       of its weight of potassium chlorate. The mixture is then heated\r\n       with twice its weight of strong sulphuric acid until no more\r\n       odoriferous gases are emitted; on cooling, the mixture is thrown\r\n       into water and washed; the graphite is then dried and heated\r\n       to a red heat; after this it shrinks considerably in volume\r\n       and forms a very fine powder, which is then washed. By acting\r\n       on graphite several times with a mixture of potassium chlorate\r\n       and nitric acid heated up to 60°, Brodie transformed it into a\r\n       yellow insoluble acid substance which he called graphitic acid,\r\n       C_{11}H_{4}O_{5}. The diamond remains unchanged when subjected to\r\n       this treatment, whilst amorphous charcoal is completely oxidised.\r\n       Availing himself of this possibility of distinguishing graphite\r\n       from the diamond or amorphous charcoal, Berthelot showed that\r\n       when compounds of carbon and hydrogen are decomposed by heat,\r\n       amorphous charcoal is mainly formed, whilst when compounds of\r\n       carbon with chlorine, sulphur, and boron are decomposed, graphite\r\n       is principally deposited.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is a crystalline and transparent form of carbon. It is of\r\nrare occurrence in nature, and is found in the alluvial deposits of\r\nthe diamond mines of Brazil, India, South Africa, &c. It has also been\r\nfound in meteorites.[15 bis] It crystallises in octahedra, dodecahedra,\r\ncubes, and other forms of the regular system.[16] The efforts which\r\nhave been made to produce diamonds artificially, although they have not\r\nbeen fruitless, have not as yet led to the production of large-sized\r\ncrystals, because those means by which crystals are generally formed\r\nare inapplicable to carbon. Indeed, carbon in all its forms being\r\ninsoluble and infusible does not pass into a liquid condition by means\r\nof which crystallisation could take place. Diamonds have several\r\ntimes been successfully produced in the shape of minute crystals\r\nhaving the appearance of a black powder, but when viewed under the\r\nmicroscope appearing transparent, and possessing that hardness which\r\nis the peculiar characteristic of the diamond. This diamond powder is\r\ndeposited on the negative electrode, when a weak galvanic current is\r\npassed through liquid chloride of carbon.[16 bis]\r\n\r\n  [15 bis] Diamonds are found in a particular dense rock, known by the\r\n       name of itacolumite, and are dug out of the _débris_ produced by\r\n       the destruction of the itacolumite by water. When the _débris_ is\r\n       washed the diamonds remain behind; they are principally found in\r\n       Brazil, in the provinces of Rio and Bahia, and at the Cape of Good\r\n       Hope. The _débris_ gives the black or amorphous diamond,\r\n       carbonado, and the ordinary colourless or yellow translucent\r\n       diamond. As the diamond possesses a very marked cleavage, the\r\n       first operation consists in splitting it, and then roughly and\r\n       finely polishing it with diamond powder. It is very remarkable\r\n       that Professors P. A. Latchinoff and Eroféeff found (1887) diamond\r\n       powder in a meteoric stone which fell in the Government of Penza,\r\n       in the district of Krasnoslobodsk, near the settlement of Novo\r\n       Urei (Sept. 10, 1886). Up to that time charcoal and graphite (a\r\n       special variety, cliftonite) had been found in meteorites and the\r\n       diamond only conjectured to occur therein. The Novo Urei meteorite\r\n       was composed of siliceous matter and metallic iron (with nickel)\r\n       like many other meteorites.\r\n\r\n  [16] Diamonds are sometimes found in the shape of small balls, and in\r\n       that case it is impossible to cut them because directly the\r\n       surface is ground or broken they fall into minute pieces.\r\n       Sometimes minute diamond crystals form a dense mass like sugar,\r\n       and this is generally reduced to diamond powder and used for\r\n       grinding. Some known varieties of the diamond are almost opaque\r\n       and of a black colour. Such diamonds are as hard as the ordinary\r\n       ones, and are used for polishing diamonds and other precious\r\n       stones, and also for rock boring and tunnelling.\r\n\r\n  [16 bis] Hannay, in 1880, obtained diamonds by heating a mixture of\r\n       heavy liquid hydrocarbons (paraffin oils) with magnesium in a\r\n       thick iron tube. This investigation, however, was not repeated.\r\n\r\nMoissan (Paris, 1893) produced diamonds artificially by means of the\r\nhigh temperature attained in the electrical furnace[17] by dissolving\r\ncarbon in molten cast iron, and allowing the solution with an excess of\r\ncarbon, to cool under the powerful pressure exerted by rapidly cooling\r\nthe metal.[17 bis] K. Chroustchoff attained the same end by means of\r\nsilver, which dissolves carbon to the extent of 6 p.c. at a high\r\ntemperature. Rousseau, for the same purpose, heated carbide of calcium\r\nin the electric furnace. There is no doubt that all these investigators\r\nobtained the diamond as a transparent body, which burnt into CO_{2}, and\r\npossessed an exceptional hardness, but only in the form of a fine powder.\r\n\r\n  [17] The _electrical furnace_ is an invention of recent times, and\r\n       gives the possibility of obtaining a temperature of 3,500°, which\r\n       is not only not obtainable in ordinary furnaces, but even in the\r\n       oxyhydrogen flame, whose temperature does not exceed 2,000°. The\r\n       electrical furnace consists of two pieces of lime, laid one on\r\n       the other. A cavity is made in the lower piece for the reception\r\n       of the substance to be melted between two thick electrodes of\r\n       dense carbon. On passing a current of 70 volts and 450 ampères\r\n       a temperature of 3,000° is easily obtained. At a temperature of\r\n       2,500° (100 ampères and 40 volts) not only do all metals melt,\r\n       but even lime and magnesia (when placed in the space between\r\n       the carbon electrodes, _i.e._ in the voltaic arc) become soft\r\n       and crystallise on cooling. At 3,000° lime becomes very fluid,\r\n       metallic calcium partially separates out and a carbon compound,\r\n       which remains liquid for a long time. At this temperature oxide\r\n       of uranium is reduced to the suboxide and metal, zirconia and\r\n       rock crystal fuse and partially volatilise, as also does alumina;\r\n       platinum, gold, and even carbon distinctly volatilise; the\r\n       majority of the metals form carbides. At such a temperature also\r\n       cast iron and carbon give graphite, while according to Rousseau,\r\n       between 2,000° and 3,000° the diamond passes into graphite and\r\n       conversely graphite into the diamond, so that this is a kind of\r\n       reversible reaction.\r\n\r\n  [17 bis] Moissan first investigated the solution of carbon in molten\r\n       metals (and the formation of the carbides) such as magnesium,\r\n       aluminium, iron, manganese, chromium, uranium, silver, platinum,\r\n       and silicon. At the same time Friedel, owing to the discovery of\r\n       the diamond in meteoric iron, admitted that the formation of the\r\n       diamond is dependent upon the influence of iron and sulphur. With\r\n       this object, that is to obtain the diamond, Friedel caused sulphur\r\n       to react upon samples of cast iron rich in carbon, in a closed\r\n       vessel at a maximum temperature of 500°, and after dissolving the\r\n       sulphide of iron formed, he obtained a small quantity of a black\r\n       powder which scratched corundum, i.e. diamond. Moissan's\r\n       experiments (1893) were more successful, probably owing to his\r\n       having employed the electrical furnace. If iron be saturated with\r\n       carbon at a temperature between 1,100° and 3,000°, then at\r\n       1,100°-1,200° a mixture of amorphous carbon and graphite is\r\n       formed, while at 3,000° graphite alone is obtained in very\r\n       beautiful crystals. Thus under these conditions the diamond is not\r\n       formed, and it can only be obtained if the high temperature be\r\n       aided by powerful pressures. For this purpose Moissan took\r\n       advantage of the pressure produced in the passage of a mass of\r\n       molten cast iron from a liquid into a solid state. He first melted\r\n       150-200 grams of iron in the electrical furnace, and quickly\r\n       introduced a cylinder of carbon into the molten iron. He then\r\n       removed the crucible with the molten iron from the furnace and\r\n       plunged it into a reservoir containing water. After treating with\r\n       boiling hydrochloric acid, three varieties of carbon were\r\n       obtained: (1) a small amount of graphite (if the cooling be\r\n       rapid); (2) carbon of a chestnut colour in very fine twisted\r\n       threads, showing that it had been subjected to a very high\r\n       pressure (a similar variety was met with in various samples of the\r\n       Canon Diabolo), and lastly (3) an inconsiderable quantity of an\r\n       exceeding dense mass which was freed from the admixture of the\r\n       lighter modifications by treatment with _aqua regia_, sulphuric\r\n       and hydrofluoric acids, and from which Moissan, by means of liquid\r\n       bromoform (sp. gr. 2·900), succeeded in separating some small\r\n       pieces, having a greater density than bromoform, which scratched\r\n       the ruby and had the properties of the diamond. Some of these\r\n       pieces were black, others were transparent and refracted light\r\n       strongly. The dark grey tint of the former resembled that of the\r\n       black diamonds (carbonado). Their density was between 3 and 3·5.\r\n       The transparent specimens had a greasy appearance and seemed to\r\n       be, as it were, surrounded by an envelope of carbon. At 1,050°\r\n       they did not burn entirely in a current of air, so that the\r\n       imperfectly burnt particles, and a peculiar form of grains of a\r\n       light ochre colour, which retained their crystalline form, could\r\n       be examined under the microscope. Similar grains also remain after\r\n       the imperfect combustion of the ordinary diamond. Moissan obtained\r\n       the same results by rapidly cooling in a stream of coal gas a\r\n       piece of cast iron, saturated with carbon obtained from sugar and\r\n       first heated to 2,000°. In this instance he obtained small\r\n       crystals of diamonds. K. Chroustchoff showed that at its boiling\r\n       point silver dissolves 6 p.c. of carbon. This silver was rapidly\r\n       cooled, so that a crust formed on the surface and prevented the\r\n       metal expanding, and so produced a powerful pressure. A portion of\r\n       the carbon which separates out under these conditions exhibits the\r\n       properties of the diamond.\r\n\r\nJudging from the fact that carbon forms a number of gaseous bodies\r\n(carbonic oxide, carbonic anhydride, methane, ethylene, acetylene, &c.)\r\nand volatile substances (for example, many hydrocarbons and their most\r\nsimple derivatives), and considering that the atomic weight of carbon, C\r\n= 12, approaches that of nitrogen, N = 14, and that of oxygen, O = 16,\r\nand that the compounds CO (carbonic oxide) and N_{2}C_{2} (cyanogen)\r\nare gases, it may be argued that if carbon formed the molecule C_{2},\r\nlike N_{2} and O_{2}, it would be a gas. And as through polymerism or\r\nthe combination of like molecules (as O_{2} passes into O_{3} or NO_{2}\r\ninto N_{2}O_{4}) the temperatures of ebullition and fusion rise (which\r\nis particularly clearly proved with the hydrocarbons of the C_{n}H_{2n}\r\nseries), it ought to be considered that _the molecules of charcoal,\r\ngraphite, and the diamond are very complex_, seeing that they are\r\ninsoluble, non-volatile, and infusible. The aptitude which the atoms of\r\ncarbon show for combining together and forming complex molecules appears\r\nin all carbon compounds. Among the volatile compounds of carbon many are\r\nwell known the molecules of which contain C_{5} ... C_{10} ... C_{20}\r\n... C_{30}, &c., in general C_{n} where n may be very large, and in none\r\nof the other elements is this faculty of complexity so developed as in\r\ncarbon.[18] Up to the present time there are no grounds for determining\r\nthe degree of polymerism of the charcoal, graphite, or diamond\r\nmolecules, and it can only be supposed that they contain C_{n} where n\r\nis a large quantity. Charcoal and those complex non-volatile organic\r\nsubstances which represent the gradual transitions to charcoal[19] and\r\nform the principal solid substances of organisms, contain a store or\r\naccumulation of internal power in the form of the energy binding the\r\natoms into complex molecules. When charcoal or complex compounds of\r\ncarbon burn, the energy of the carbon and oxygen is turned into heat,\r\nand this fact is taken advantage of at every turn for the generation of\r\nheat from fuel.[20]\r\n\r\n  [18] The existence of a molecule S_{6} is known (up to 600°), and it\r\n       must he beld that this accounts for the formation of hydrogen\r\n       persulphide, H_{2}S_{5}. Phosphorus appears in the molecule\r\n       P_{4} and gives P_{4}H_{2}. When expounding the data on specific\r\n       heat we shall have occasion to return to the question of the\r\n       complexity of the carbon molecule.\r\n\r\n  [19] The hydrocarbons poor in hydrogen and containing many atoms of\r\n       carbon, like chrysene and carbopetrocene, &c.,\r\n       C_{_n_}H_{2(_n_-_m_)}, are solids, and less fusible as _n_ and\r\n       _m_ increase. They present a marked approach to the properties\r\n       of the diamond. And in proportion to the diminution of the water\r\n       in the carbohydrates C_{_n_}H_{2_m_}O_{_m_}--for example in the\r\n       humic compounds (Note 5)--the transition of complex organic\r\n       substances to charcoal is very evident. That residue resembling\r\n       charcoal and graphite which is obtained by the separation (by\r\n       means of copper sulphate and sodium chloride) of iron from white\r\n       cast-iron containing carbon chemically combined with the iron,\r\n       also seems, especially after the researches of G. A. Zaboudsky,\r\n       to be a complex substance containing C_{12}H_{6}O_{3}. The\r\n       endeavours which have been directed towards determining the\r\n       measure of complexity of the molecules of charcoal, graphite, and\r\n       the diamond will probably at some period lead to the solution\r\n       of this problem and will most likely prove that the various\r\n       forms of charcoal, graphite, and the diamond contain molecules\r\n       of different and very considerable complexity. The constancy of\r\n       the grouping of benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, and the wide diffusion and\r\n       facility of formation of the carbohydrates containing C_{6} (for\r\n       example, cellulose, C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, glucose, C_{6}H_{12}O_{6})\r\n       give reason for thinking that the group C_{6} is the first and\r\n       simplest of those possible to free carbon, and it may be hoped\r\n       that some time or other it may be possible to get carbon in this\r\n       form. Perhaps in the diamond there may be found such a relation\r\n       between the atoms as in the benzene group, and in charcoal such\r\n       as in carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n  [20] When charcoal burns, the complex molecule C_{_n_} is resolved into\r\n       the simple molecules _n_CO_{2}, and therefore part of the\r\n       heat--probably no small amount--is expended in the destruction of\r\n       the complex molecule C_{_n_}. Perhaps by burning the most complex\r\n       substances, which are the poorest as regards hydrogen, it may be\r\n       possible to form an idea of the work required to split up C_{_n_}\r\n       into separate atoms.\r\n\r\nNo other two elements are capable of combining together in such variety\r\nas carbon and hydrogen. The hydrocarbons of the C_{_n_}H_{2_m_} series\r\nin many cases differ widely from each other, although they have some\r\nproperties in common. All hydrocarbons, whether gaseous, liquid or\r\nsolid, are combustible substances sparingly soluble or insoluble in\r\nwater. The liquefied gaseous hydrocarbons, as well as those which are\r\nliquid at ordinary temperatures, and those solid hydrocarbons which\r\nhave been liquefied by fusion, have the appearance and property of oily\r\nliquors, more or less viscid, or fluid.[21] The solid hydrocarbons\r\nmore or less resemble wax in their properties, although ordinary oils\r\nand wax generally contain oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen,\r\nbut in relatively small proportion. There are also many hydrocarbons\r\nwhich have the appearance of tar--as, for instance, metacinnamene and\r\ngutta-percha. Those liquid hydrocarbons which boil at a high temperature\r\nare like oils, and those which have a low boiling point resemble ether,\r\nwhilst the gaseous hydrocarbons in many of their properties are akin\r\nto hydrogen. All this tends to show that in hydrocarbons physically\r\nconsidered the properties of solid non-volatile charcoal are strongly\r\nmodified and hidden, whilst those of the hydrogen predominate. All\r\nhydrocarbons are neutral substances (neither basic nor acid), but under\r\ncertain conditions they enter into peculiar reactions. It has been seen\r\nin those hydrogen compounds which have been already considered (water,\r\nnitric acid, ammonia) that the hydrogen in almost all cases enters into\r\nreaction, being displaced by metals. The hydrogen of the hydrocarbons,\r\nit may be said, has no metallic character that is to say, it is not\r\ndirectly[22] displaced by metals, even by such as sodium and potassium.\r\nOn the application of more or less heat all hydrocarbons decompose[23]\r\nforming charcoal and hydrogen. The majority of hydrocarbons do not\r\ncombine with the oxygen of the air or oxidise at ordinary temperatures,\r\nbut under the action of nitric acid and many other oxidising substances\r\nmost of them undergo oxidation, in which either a portion of the\r\nhydrogen and carbon is separated, or the oxygen enters into combination,\r\nor else the elements of hydrogen peroxide enter into combination with\r\nthe hydrocarbon.[24] When heated in air, hydrocarbons burn, and,\r\naccording to the amount of carbon they contain, their combustion is\r\nattended more or less with a separation of soot--that is, finely divided\r\ncharcoal--which imparts great brilliancy to the flame, and on this\r\naccount many of them are used for the purposes of illumination--as,\r\nfor instance, kerosene, coal gas, oil of turpentine. As hydrocarbons\r\ncontain reducing elements (that is, those capable of combining with\r\noxygen), they often act as reducing agents--as, for instance, when\r\nheated with oxide of copper, they burn, forming carbonic anhydride and\r\nwater, and leave metallic copper. Gerhardt proved that all hydrocarbons\r\ncontain an even number of hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the general formula\r\nfor all hydrocarbons is C_{_n_}H_{2_m_} where _n_ and _m_ are whole\r\nnumbers. This fact is known as _the law of even numbers_. Hence, the\r\nsimplest possible hydrocarbons ought to be: CH_{2}, CH_{4}, CH_{6} ...\r\nC_{2}H_{2}, C_{2}H_{4}, C_{2}H_{6}, C_{2}H_{8} ... but they do not all\r\nexist, since the quantity of H which can combine with a certain amount\r\nof carbon is limited, as we shall learn directly.\r\n\r\n  [21] The viscosity, or degree of mobility, of liquids is determined\r\n       by their internal friction. It is estimated by passing the\r\n       liquids through narrow (capillary) tubes, the mobile liquids\r\n       passing through with greater facility and speed than the viscid\r\n       ones. The viscosity varies with the temperature and nature of the\r\n       liquids, and in the case of solutions changes with the amount of\r\n       the substance dissolved, but is not proportional to it. So that,\r\n       for example, with alcohol at 20° the viscosity will be 69, and\r\n       for a 50 p.c. solution 160, the viscosity of water being taken as\r\n       100. The volume of the liquid which passes through by experiment\r\n       (Poiseuille) and theory (Stokes) is proportional to the time, the\r\n       pressure, and the fourth power of the diameter of the (capillary)\r\n       tube, and inversely proportional to the length of the tube;\r\n       this renders it possible to form comparative estimates of the\r\n       coefficients of internal friction and viscosity.\r\n\r\n       As the complexity of the molecules of hydrocarbons and their\r\n       derivatives increases by the addition of carbon (or CH_{2}), so\r\n       does the degree of viscosity also rise. The extensive series\r\n       of investigations referring to this subject still await the\r\n       necessary generalisation. That connection which (already partly\r\n       observed) ought to exist between the viscosity and the other\r\n       physical and chemical properties, forces us to conclude that\r\n       the magnitude of internal friction plays an important part in\r\n       molecular mechanics. In investigating organic compounds and\r\n       solutions, similar researches ought to stand foremost. Many\r\n       observations have already been made, but not much has yet been\r\n       done with them; the bare facts and some mechanical data exist,\r\n       but their relation to molecular mechanics has not been cleared up\r\n       in the requisite degree. It has already been seen from existing\r\n       data that the viscosity at the temperature of the absolute\r\n       boiling point becomes as small as in gases.\r\n\r\n  [22] In a number of hydrocarbons and their derivatives such a\r\n       substitution of metals for the hydrogen may be attained by\r\n       indirect means. The property shown by acetylene, C_{2}H_{2},\r\n       and its analogues, of forming metallic derivatives is in this\r\n       respect particularly characteristic. Judging from the fact that\r\n       carbon is an acid element (that is, gives an acid anhydride with\r\n       oxygen), though comparatively slightly acid (for carbonic acid is\r\n       not at all a strong acid and compounds of chlorine and carbon,\r\n       even CCl_{4}, are not decomposed by water as is the case with\r\n       phosphorus chloride and even silicic chloride and boric chloride,\r\n       although they correspond with acids of but little energy),\r\n       one might expect to find in the hydrogen of hydrocarbons this\r\n       faculty for being substituted by metals. The metallic compounds\r\n       which correspond with hydrocarbons are known under the name of\r\n       organo-metallic compounds. Such, for instance, is zinc ethyl,\r\n       Zn(C_{2}H_{5})_{2}, which corresponds with ethyl hydride or\r\n       ethane, C_{2}H_{6}, in which two atoms of hydrogen have been\r\n       exchanged for one of zinc.\r\n\r\n  [23] Gaseous and volatile hydrocarbons decompose when passed through a\r\n       heated tube. When hydrocarbons are decomposed by heating, the\r\n       primary products are generally other more stable hydrocarbons,\r\n       among which are acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, benzene, C_{6}H_{6},\r\n       naphthalene, C_{10}H_{8}, &c.\r\n\r\n  [24] Wagner (1888) showed that when unsaturated hydrocarbons are shaken\r\n       with a weak (1 p.c.) solution of potassium permanganate,\r\n       KMnO_{4}, at ordinary temperatures, they form glycols--for\r\n       example, C_{2}H_{4} yields C_{2}H_{6}O_{2}.\r\n\r\nSome of the hydrocarbons are capable of combination, whilst others\r\ndo not show that power. Those which contain less hydrogen belong to\r\nthe former category, and those which, for a given quantity of carbon,\r\ncontain the maximum amount of hydrogen, belong to the latter. The\r\ncomposition of those last mentioned is expressed by the general formula\r\nC_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2}. These so-called _saturated hydrocarbons_ are\r\nincapable of combination.[25] The hydrocarbons CH_{6}, C_{2}H_{8},\r\nC_{3}H_{10}, &c.... do not exist. Those containing the maximum amount\r\nof hydrogen will be represented by CH_{4} (_n_ = 1, 2_n_ + 2 = 4),\r\nC_{2}H_{6} (_n_ = 2), C_{3}H_{8} (n = 3), C_{4}H_{10}, &c. This may be\r\ntermed the _law of limits_. Placing this in juxtaposition with the law\r\nof even numbers, it is easy to perceive that the possible hydrocarbons\r\ncan be ranged in series, the terms of which may be expressed by the\r\ngeneral formulæ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2},\r\n&c.... Those hydrocarbons which belong to any one of the series\r\nexpressible by a general formula are said to be _homologous_0 with\r\none another. Thus, the hydrocarbons CH_{4}, C_{2}H_{6}, C_{3}H_{8},\r\nC_{4}H_{10}, &c.... are members of the limiting (saturated) homologous\r\nseries C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}. That is, the difference between the members\r\nof the series is CH_{2}.[26] Not only the composition but also the\r\nproperties of the members of a series tend to classification in one\r\ngroup. For instance, the members of the series C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}\r\nare not capable of forming additive compounds, whilst those of the\r\nseries C_{_n_}H_{2_n_} are capable of combining with chlorine,\r\nsulphuric anhydride, &c.; and the members of the C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-6}\r\ngroup, belonging to the coal tar series, are easily nitrated (give\r\nnitro-compounds, Chapter VI.), and have other properties in common.\r\nThe physical properties of the members of a given homologous series\r\nvary in some such manner as this; the boiling point generally rises and\r\nthe internal friction increases as _n_ increases[27]--that is, with an\r\nincrease in the relative amount of carbon and the atomic weight; the\r\nspecific gravity also regularly changes as _n_ becomes greater.[28]\r\n\r\n  [25] My article on this subject appeared in the Journal of the\r\n       St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1861. Up to that time,\r\n       although many additive combinations with hydrocarbons and their\r\n       derivatives were known, they had not been generalised, and were\r\n       even continually quoted as cases of substitution. Thus the\r\n       combination of ethylene, C_{2}H_{4}, with chlorine, Cl_{2}, was\r\n       often regarded as a formation of the products of the substitution\r\n       of C_{2}H_{5}Cl and HCl, which it was supposed were held together\r\n       as the water of crystallisation is in salts. Even earlier than\r\n       this (1857, _Journal of the Petroffsky Academy_) I considered\r\n       similar cases as true compounds. In general, according to the\r\n       law of limits, an unsaturated hydrocarbon, or its derivative, on\r\n       combining with _r_X_{2}, gives a substance which is saturated or\r\n       else approaching the limit. The investigations of Frankland with\r\n       many organo-metallic compounds clearly showed the limit in the\r\n       case of metallic compounds, which we shall constantly refer to\r\n       later on.\r\n\r\n  [26] The conception of homology has been applied by Gerhardt to all\r\n       organic compounds in his classical work, 'Traité de Chimie\r\n       Organique,' finished in 1855 (4 vols.), in which he divided\r\n       all organic compounds into _fatty_ and _aromatic_, which is in\r\n       principle still adhered to at the present time, although the\r\n       latter are more often called benzene derivatives, on account of\r\n       the fact that Kekulé, in his beautiful investigations on the\r\n       structure of aromatic compounds, showed the presence in them all\r\n       of the 'benzene nucleus,' C_{6}H_{6}.\r\n\r\n  [27] This is always true for hydrocarbons, but for derivatives of the\r\n       lower homologues the law is sometimes different; for instance,\r\n       in the series of saturated alcohols, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+1}(OH),\r\n       when _n_ = 0, we obtain water, H(OH), which boils at 100°, and\r\n       whose specific gravity at 15° = 0·9992; when _n_ = 1, wood\r\n       spirit CH_{3}(OH), which boils at 66°, and at 15° has a specific\r\n       gravity = 0·7964; when _n_ = 2, ordinary alcohol, C_{2}H_{5}(OH),\r\n       boiling at 78°, specific gravity at 15° = 0·7936, and with\r\n       further increase of CH_{2} the specific gravity increases. For\r\n       the glycols C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}(OH)_{2} the phenomenon of a similar\r\n       kind is still more striking; at first the temperature of the\r\n       boiling point and the density increase, and then for higher (more\r\n       complex) members of the series diminish. The reason for this\r\n       phenomenon, it is evident, must be sought for in the influence\r\n       and properties of water, and that strong affinity which, acting\r\n       between hydrogen and oxygen, determines many of the exceptional\r\n       properties of water (Chapter I.).\r\n\r\n  [28] As, for example, in the saturated series of hydrocarbons\r\n       C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}, the lowest member (_n_ = 0) must be taken as\r\n       hydrogen H_{2}, a gas which (_t.c._ below -190°) is liquefied\r\n       with great difficulty, and when in a liquid state has doubtless\r\n       a very small density. Where _n_ = 1, 2, 3, the hydrocarbons\r\n       CH_{4}, C_{2}H_{6}, C_{3}H_{8} are gases, more and more readily\r\n       liquefiable. The temperature of the absolute boiling point for\r\n       CH_{4} =-100°, and for ethane C_{2}H_{6}, and in the higher\r\n       members it rises. The hydrocarbon C_{4}H_{10}, liquefies at about\r\n       0°. C_{5}H_{12} (there are several isomers) boils at from +9°\r\n       (Lvoff) to 37°, C_{6}H_{14} from 58° to 78°, &c. The specific\r\n       gravities in a liquid state at 15° are:--\r\n\r\n       C_{5}H_{12}  C_{6}H_{14}  C_{7}H_{16}  C_{10}H_{22}  C_{16}H_{34}\r\n          0·63         0·66         0·70          0·75          0·85\r\n\r\nMany of the hydrocarbons met with in nature are the products of\r\norganisms, and do not belong to the mineral kingdom. A still greater\r\nnumber are produced artificially. These are formed by what is termed\r\nthe combination of residues. For instance, if a mixture of the vapours\r\nof hydrogen sulphide and carbon bisulphide be passed through a tube\r\nin which copper is heated, this latter absorbs the sulphur from both\r\nthe compounds, and the liberated carbon and hydrogen combine to form\r\na hydrocarbon, methane. If carbon be combined with any metal and this\r\ncompound MC_{_n_} be treated with an acid HX, then the haloid X will\r\ngive a salt with the metal and the residual carbon and hydrogen will\r\ngive a hydrocarbon. Thus cast iron which contains a compound of iron\r\nand carbon gives liquid hydrocarbons like naphtha under the action\r\nof acids. If a mixture of bromo-benzene, C_{6}H_{5}Br, and ethyl\r\nbromide, C_{2}H_{5}Br, be heated with metallic sodium, the sodium\r\ncombines with the bromine of both compounds, forming sodium bromide,\r\nNaBr. From the first combination the group C_{6}H_{5} remains, and\r\nfrom the second C_{2}H_{5}. Having an odd number of hydrogen atoms,\r\nthey, in virtue of the law of even numbers, cannot exist alone, and\r\ntherefore combine together forming the compound C_{6}H_{5}.C_{2}H_{5}\r\nor C_{8}H_{10} (ethylbenzene). Hydrocarbons are also produced by the\r\nbreaking up of more complex organic or hydrocarbon compounds, especially\r\nby heating--that is, by dry distillation. For instance, gum-benzoin\r\ncontains an acid called benzoic acid, C_{7}H_{6}O_{2}, the vapours\r\nof which, when passed through a heated tube, split up into carbonic\r\nanhydride, CO_{2}, and benzene, C_{6}H_{6}. Carbon and hydrogen only\r\nunite directly in one ratio of combination--namely, to form acetylene,\r\nhaving the composition C_{2}H_{2}, which, as compared with other\r\nhydrocarbons, exhibits a very great stability at a somewhat high\r\ntemperature.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] If, at the ordinary temperature (assuming therefore that the\r\n       water formed will be in a liquid state) a gram molecule (26\r\n       grams) of acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, be burnt, 310 thousand calories\r\n       will be emitted (Thomsen), and as 12 grams of charcoal produce 97\r\n       thousand calories, and 2 grams of hydrogen 69 thousand calories,\r\n       it follows that, if the hydrogen and carbon of the acetylene were\r\n       burnt there would be only 2 × 97 + 69, or 263 thousand calories\r\n       produced. It is evident, then, that acetylene in its formation\r\n       absorbs 310-263, or 47 thousand calories.\r\n\r\n       For considerations relative to the combustion of carbon\r\n       compounds, we will first enumerate the quantity of heat separated\r\n       by the combustion of definite chemical carbon compounds, and then\r\n       give a few figures bearing on the kinds of fuel used in practice.\r\n\r\n       For molecular quantities in perfect combustion the following\r\n       amounts of heat are given out (when gaseous carbonic anhydride\r\n       and liquid water are formed), according to Thomsen's data (1)\r\n       for gaseous C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2}: 52·8 + 158·8_n_ thousand\r\n       calories; (2) for C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}: 17·7 + 158·1_n_ thousand\r\n       calories; (3) according to Stohmann (1888) for liquid saturated\r\n       alcohols, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2}O: 11·8 + 156·3_n_, and as the\r\n       latent heat of evaporation = about 8·2 + 0·6_n_, in a gaseous\r\n       state, 20·0 + 156·9_n_; (4) for monobasic saturated liquid\r\n       acids, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}O_{2}:--95·3 + 154·3_n_, and as their\r\n       latent heat of evaporation is about 5·0 + 1·2_n_, in a gaseous\r\n       form, about--90 + 155_n_; (5) for solid saturated bibasic acids,\r\n       C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2}O_{4}:--253·8 + 152·6_n_, if they are expressed\r\n       as C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}, then 51·4 + 152·6_n_; (6)\r\n       for benzene and its liquid homologues (still according to\r\n       Stohmann) C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-6}:--158·6 + 156·3_n_, and in a gaseous\r\n       form about--155 + 157_n_; (7) for the gaseous homologues of\r\n       acetylene, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2} (according to Thomsen)--5 + 157_n_.\r\n       It is evident from the preceding figures that the group CH_{2},\r\n       or CH_{3} substituted for H, on burning gives out from 152 to\r\n       159 thousand calories. This is less than that given out by C +\r\n       H_{2}, which is 97 + 69 or 166 thousand; the reason for this\r\n       difference (it would be still greater if carbon were gaseous)\r\n       is the amount of heat separated during the formation of CH_{2}.\r\n       According to Stohmann, for dextroglucose, C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}, it\r\n       is 673·7; for common sugar, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}, 1325·7; for\r\n       cellulose, C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, 678·0; starch, 677·5; dextrin,\r\n       666·2; glycol, C_{2}H_{6}O_{2}, 281·7; glycerine, 397·2, &c.\r\n       The heat of combustion of the following solids (determined\r\n       by Stohmann) is expressed per unit of weight: naphthalene,\r\n       C_{10}H_{8}, 9,621; urea, CN_{2}H_{4}O, 2,465; white of egg,\r\n       5,579; dry rye bread, 4,421; wheaten bread, 4,302; tallow, 9,365;\r\n       butter, 9,192; linseed oil, 9,323. The most complete collection\r\n       of arithmetical data for the heats of combustion will be found\r\n       in V. F. Longinin's work, 'Description of the Various Methods\r\n       of Determining the Heats of Combustion of Organic Compounds'\r\n       (Moscow, 1894).\r\n\r\n       The number of units of heat given out by _unit weight_ during the\r\n       complete combustion and cooling of the following ordinary kinds\r\n       of fuel in their usual state of dryness and purity are:--(1) for\r\n       wood charcoal, anthracite, semi-anthracite, bituminous coal and\r\n       coke, from 7,200 to 8,200; (2) dry, long flaming coals, and the\r\n       best brown coals, from 6,200 to 6,800; (3) perfectly dry wood,\r\n       3,500; hardly dry, 2,500; (4) perfectly dry peat, best kind,\r\n       4,500; compressed and dried, 3,000; (5) petroleum refuse and\r\n       similar liquid hydrocarbons, about 11,000; (6) illuminating gas\r\n       of the ordinary composition (about 45 vols. H, 40 vols. CH_{4}, 5\r\n       vols. CO, and 5 vols. N), about 12,000; (7) producer gas (_see_\r\n       next Chapter), containing 2 vols. carbonic anhydride, 30 vols.\r\n       carbonic oxide, and 68 vols. nitrogen _for one part by weight of\r\n       the whole carbon burnt_, 5,300, and for one part by weight of the\r\n       gas, 910, units of heat; and (8) water gas (_see_ next chapter)\r\n       containing 4 vols. carbonic anhydride, 8 vols. N_{2}, 24 vols.\r\n       carbonic oxide, and 46 vols. H_{2}, for one part by weight of\r\n       the carbon consumed in the _generator_ 10,900, and for one part\r\n       by weight of the gas, 3,600 units of heat. In these figures,\r\n       as in all calorimetric observations, the water produced by the\r\n       combustion of the fuel is supposed to be liquid. As regards the\r\n       temperature reached by the fuel, it is important to remark that\r\n       for solid fuel it is indispensable to admit (to ensure complete\r\n       combustion) twice the amount of air required, but liquid, or\r\n       pulverised fuel, and especially gaseous fuel, does not require an\r\n       excess of air; therefore, a kilogram of charcoal, giving 8,000\r\n       units of heat, requires about 24 kilograms of air (3 kilograms\r\n       of air per thousand calories) and a kilogram of producer gas\r\n       requires only 0·77 kilogram of air (0·85 kilo. of air per 1,000\r\n       calories), 1 kilogram of water gas about 4·5 of air (1·25 kilo.\r\n       of air per 1,000 calories).\r\n\r\nThere is one substance known among the saturated hydrocarbons composed\r\nof 1 atom of carbon and 4 atoms of hydrogen; this is a compound\r\ncontaining the highest percentage of hydrogen (CH_{4} contains 25 per\r\ncent. of hydrogen), and at the same time it is the only hydrocarbon\r\nwhose molecule contains but a single atom of carbon. This saturated\r\nhydrocarbon, CH_{4}, is called _marsh gas_ or _methane_. If vegetable\r\nor animal refuse suffers decomposition in a space where the air has not\r\nfree access, or no access at all, then the decomposition is accompanied\r\nwith the formation of marsh gas, and this either at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, or at a comparatively much higher one. On this account\r\n_plants_, when decomposing under water in _marshes_, give out this\r\ngas.[29 bis] It is well known that if the mud in bogs be stirred up,\r\nthe act is accompanied with the evolution of a large quantity of gas\r\nbubbles; these may, although slowly, also separate of their own accord.\r\nThe gas which is evolved consists principally of marsh gas.[30] If\r\nwood, coal, or many other vegetable or animal substances are decomposed\r\nby the _action of heat_ without access of air--that is, are subjected\r\nto dry distillation--they, in addition to many other gaseous products\r\nof decomposition (carbonic anhydride, hydrogen, and various other\r\nsubstances), evolve a great deal of methane. Generally the gas which\r\nis used for lighting purposes is obtained by this means and therefore\r\nalways contains marsh gas, mixed with dry hydrogen and other vapours and\r\ngases, although it is subsequently purified from many of them.[31]\r\nAs the decomposition of the organic matter, which forms coal, is still\r\ngoing on underground, the evolution of large quantities of marsh gas\r\nfrequently occurs in coal-mines.[32] When mixed with air it forms\r\nan explosive mixture, which forms one of the great dangers of coal\r\nmining, as subterranean work has always to be carried on by lamp-light.\r\nThis danger is, however, overcome by the use of Humphry Davy's safety\r\nlamp.[33] Sir Humphry Davy observed that on introducing a piece of\r\nwire gauze into a flame, it absorbs so much heat that combustion does\r\nnot proceed beyond it (the unburnt gases which pass through it may\r\nbe ignited on the other side). In accordance with this, the flame\r\nof the Davy lamp is surrounded with a thick glass (as shown in the\r\ndrawing), and has no communication whatever with the explosive mixture\r\nexcept through a wire gauze which prevents it igniting the mixture\r\nof the marsh-gas issuing from the coal with air. In some districts,\r\nparticularly in those where petroleum is found--as, for instance, near\r\nBaku, where a temple of the Indian fire-worshippers was built, and in\r\nPennsylvania, and other places--marsh gas in abundance issues from the\r\nearth, and it is used, like coal gas, for the purposes of lighting and\r\nwarming.[34] Tolerably pure marsh gas[35] may be obtained by heating\r\na mixture of an acetate with an alkali. Acetic acid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2},\r\non being heated is decomposed into marsh gas and carbonic anhydride,\r\nC_{2}H_{4}O_{2} = CH_{4} + CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [29 bis] Manure which decomposes under the action of bacteria gives off\r\n       CO_{2} and CH_{4}.\r\n\r\n  [30] It is easy to collect the gas which is evolved in marshy places\r\n       if a glass bottle be inverted in the water and a funnel put into\r\n       it (both filled with water); if the mud of the bottom be now\r\n       agitated, the bubbles which rise may be easily caught by the\r\n       inverted funnel.\r\n\r\n  [31] [Illustration: FIG. 58.--General view of gas works. _B_, retorts;\r\n       _f_, hydraulic main; _H_ and _I_, tar well; _i_, condensers; _L_,\r\n       purifiers; _P_, gasholder.]\r\n\r\n       Illuminating gas is generally prepared by heating gas coal\r\n       (_see_ Note 6) in oval cylindrical horizontal cast-iron or clay\r\n       retorts. Several such retorts _BB_ (fig. 58) are disposed in the\r\n       furnace _A_, and heated together. When the retorts are heated\r\n       to a red heat, lumps of coal are thrown into them, and they\r\n       are then closed with a closely fitting cover. The illustration\r\n       shows the furnace, with five retorts. Coke (_see_ Note 1, dry\r\n       distillation) remains in the retorts, and the volatile products\r\n       in the form of vapours and gases travel along the pipe _d_,\r\n       rising from each retort. These pipes branch above the stove, and\r\n       communicate with the receiver _f_ (hydraulic main) placed above\r\n       the furnace. Those products of the dry distillation which most\r\n       easily pass from the gaseous into the liquid and solid states\r\n       collect in the hydraulic main. From the hydraulic main the\r\n       vapours and gases travel along the pipe _g_ and the series of\r\n       vertical pipes _j_ (which are sometimes cooled by water trickling\r\n       over the surface), where the vapours and gases cool from the\r\n       contact of the colder surface, and a fresh quantity of vapour\r\n       condenses. The condensed liquids pass from the pipes _g_ and _j_\r\n       and into the troughs _H_. These troughs always contain liquid\r\n       at a constant level (the excess flowing away) so that the gas\r\n       cannot escape, and thus they form, as it is termed, a hydraulic\r\n       joint. In the state in which it leaves the condensers the gas\r\n       consists principally of the following vapours and gases: (1)\r\n       vapour of water, (2) ammonium carbonate, (3) liquid hydrocarbons,\r\n       (4) hydrogen sulphide, H_{2}S, (5) carbonic anhydride, CO_{2},\r\n       (6) carbonic oxide, CO, (7) sulphurous anhydride, SO_{2}, but\r\n       a great part of the illuminating gas consists of (8) hydrogen,\r\n       (9) marsh gas, (10) olefiant gas, C_{2}H_{4}, and other gaseous\r\n       hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons (3, 9, and 10), the hydrogen,\r\n       and carbonic oxide are capable of combustion, and are useful\r\n       component parts, but the carbonic anhydride, the hydrogen\r\n       sulphide, and sulphurous anhydride, as well as the vapours of\r\n       ammonium carbonate, form an injurious admixture, because they\r\n       do not burn (CO_{2}, SO_{2}) and lower the temperature and\r\n       brilliancy of the flame, or else, although capable of burning\r\n       (for example, H_{2}S, CS_{2}, and others), they give out during\r\n       combustion sulphurous anhydride which has a disagreeable smell,\r\n       is injurious when inhaled, and spoils many surrounding objects.\r\n       In order to separate the injurious products, the gas is washed\r\n       with water, a cylinder (not shown in the illustration) filled\r\n       with coke continually moistened with water serving for this\r\n       purpose. The water coming into contact with the gas dissolves\r\n       the ammonium carbonate; hydrogen sulphide, carbonic anhydride,\r\n       and sulphurous anhydride, being only partly soluble in water,\r\n       have to be got rid of by a special means. For this purpose the\r\n       gas is passed through moist lime or other alkaline liquid, as\r\n       the above-mentioned gases have acid properties and are therefore\r\n       retained by the alkali. In the case of lime, calcium carbonate,\r\n       sulphite and sulphide, all solid substances, are formed. It is\r\n       necessary to renew the purifying material as its absorbing power\r\n       decreases. A mixture of lime and sulphate of iron, FeSO_{4},\r\n       acts still better, because the latter, with lime, Ca(HO)_{2},\r\n       forms ferrous hydroxide, Fe(HO)_{2} and gypsum, CaSO_{4}. The\r\n       suboxide (partly turning into oxide) of iron absorbs H_{2}S,\r\n       forming FeS and H_{2}O, and the gypsum retains the remainder of\r\n       the ammonia, the excess of lime absorbing carbonic anhydride\r\n       and sulphuric anhydride. [In English works a native hydrated\r\n       ferric hydroxide is used for removing hydrogen sulphide.] This\r\n       purification of the gas takes place in the apparatus _L_, where\r\n       the gas passes through perforated trays _m_, covered with\r\n       sawdust mixed with lime and sulphate of iron. It is necessary\r\n       to remark that in the manufacture of gas it is indispensable\r\n       to draw off the vapours from the retorts, so that they should\r\n       not remain there long (otherwise the hydrocarbons would in a\r\n       considerable degree be resolved into charcoal and hydrogen),\r\n       and also to avoid a great pressure of gas in the apparatus,\r\n       otherwise a quantity of gas would escape at all cracks such as\r\n       must inevitably exist in such a complicated arrangement. For\r\n       this purpose there are special pumps (exhausters) so regulated\r\n       that they only pump off the quantity of gas formed (the pump is\r\n       not shown in the illustration). The purified gas passes through\r\n       the pipe _n_ into the gasometer (gasholder) _P_, a dome made of\r\n       iron plate. The edges of the dome dip into water poured into a\r\n       ring-shaped channel _g_, in which the sides of the dome rise and\r\n       fall. The gas is collected in this holder, and distributed to its\r\n       destination by pipes communicating with the pipe _o_, issuing\r\n       from the dome. The pressure of the dome on the gas enables it, on\r\n       issuing from a long pipe, to penetrate through the small aperture\r\n       of the burner. A hundred kilograms of coal give about 20 to 30\r\n       cubic metres of gas, having a density from four to nine times\r\n       greater than that of hydrogen. A cubic metre (1,000 litres) of\r\n       hydrogen weighs about 87 grams; therefore 100 kilograms of coal\r\n       give about 18 kilograms of gas, or about one-sixth of its weight.\r\n       Illuminating gas is generally lighter than marsh gas, as it\r\n       contains a considerable amount of hydrogen, and is only heavier\r\n       than marsh gas when it contains much of the heavier hydrocarbons.\r\n       Thus olefiant gas, C_{2}H_{4}, is fourteen times, and the\r\n       vapours of benzene thirty-nine times, heavier than hydrogen, and\r\n       illuminating gas sometimes contains 15 p.c. of its volume of\r\n       them. The brilliancy of the flame of the gas increases with the\r\n       quantity of olefiant gas and similar heavy hydrocarbons, as it\r\n       then contains more carbon for a given volume and a greater number\r\n       of carbon particles are separated. Gas usually contains from 35\r\n       to 60 p.c. of its volume of marsh gas, from 30 to 50 p.c. of\r\n       hydrogen, from 3 to 5 p.c. of carbonic oxide, from 2 to 10 p.c.\r\n       heavy hydrocarbons, and from 3 to 10 p.c. of nitrogen. Wood gives\r\n       almost the same sort of gas as coal and almost the same quantity,\r\n       but the wood gas contains a great deal of carbonic anhydride,\r\n       although on the other hand there is an almost complete absence\r\n       of sulphur compounds. Tar, oils, naphtha, and such materials\r\n       furnish a large quantity of good illuminating gas. An ordinary\r\n       burner of 8 to 12 candle-power burns 5 to 6 cubic feet of coal\r\n       gas per hour, but only 1 cubic foot of naphtha gas. One pood (36\r\n       lbs. Eng.) of naphtha gives 500 cubic feet of gas--that is, one\r\n       kilogram of naphtha produces about one cubic metre of gas. The\r\n       formation of combustible gas by heating coal was discovered in\r\n       the beginning of the last century, but only put into practice\r\n       towards the end by Le-Bon in France and Murdoch in England. In\r\n       England, Murdoch, together with the renowned Watt, built the\r\n       first gas works in 1805.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Blowpipe. Air is blown in at the\r\n       trumpet-shaped mouthpiece, and escapes in a fine stream from the\r\n       platinum jet placed at the extremity of the side tube.]\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Davy safety-lamp. [Modern form.]]\r\n\r\n       In practice illuminating gas is not only used for lighting\r\n       (electricity and kerosene are cheaper in Russia), but also as\r\n       the motive power for gas engines (_see_ p. 175), which consume\r\n       about half a cubic metre per horse-power per hour; gas is also\r\n       used in laboratories for heating purposes. When it is necessary\r\n       to concentrate the heat, either the ordinary blowpipe (fig. 59)\r\n       is applied, placing the end in the flame and blowing through\r\n       the mouthpiece; or, in other forms, gas is passed through the\r\n       blowpipe; when a large, hot, smokeless flame is required for\r\n       heating crucibles or glass-blowing, a foot-blower is used.\r\n       High temperatures, which are often required for laboratory and\r\n       manufacturing purposes, are most easily attained by the use of\r\n       gaseous fuel (illuminating gas, producer gas, and water gas,\r\n       which will be treated of in the following chapter), because\r\n       complete combustion may be effected without an access of air. It\r\n       is evident that in order to obtain high temperatures means must\r\n       be taken to diminish the loss of heat by radiation, and to ensure\r\n       perfect combustion.\r\n\r\n  [32] The gas which is set free in coal mines contains a good deal\r\n       of nitrogen, some carbonic anhydride, and a large quantity of\r\n       marsh gas. The best means of avoiding an explosion consists\r\n       in efficient ventilation. It is best to light coal mines with\r\n       electric lamps.\r\n\r\n  [33] The Davy lamp, of which an improved form is represented in the\r\n       accompanying figure, is used for lighting coal and other mines\r\n       where combustible gas is found. The wick of the lamp is enclosed\r\n       in a thick glass cylinder which is firmly held in a metallic\r\n       holder. Over this a metallic cylinder and the wire gauze are\r\n       placed. The products of combustion pass through the gauze, and\r\n       the air enters through the space between the cylinder and the\r\n       wire gauze. To ensure greater safety the lamp cannot be opened\r\n       without extinguishing the flame.\r\n\r\n  [34] In Pennsylvania (beyond the Alleghany mountains) many of the\r\n       shafts sunk for petroleum only emitted gas, but many useful\r\n       applications for it were found and it was conducted in metallic\r\n       pipes to works hundreds of miles distant, principally for\r\n       metallurgical purposes.\r\n\r\n  [35] The purest gas is prepared by mixing the liquid substance called\r\n       zinc methyl, Zn(CH_{3})_{2}, with water, when the following\r\n       reaction occurs:\r\n\r\n             Zn(CH_{3})_{2} + 2HOH = Zn(HO)_{2} + 2CH_{3}H.\r\n\r\nAn alkali--for instance, NaHO--gives with acetic acid a salt,\r\nC_{2}H_{3}NaO_{2}, which on decomposition retains carbonic anhydride,\r\nforming a carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and marsh gas is given off:\r\n\r\n            C_{2}H_{3}NaO_{2} + NaHO = Na_{2}CO_{3} + CH_{4}\r\n\r\nMarsh gas is difficult to liquefy; it is almost insoluble in water,\r\nand is without taste or smell. The most important point in connection\r\nwith its chemical reactions is that it does not combine directly with\r\nanything, whilst the other hydrocarbons which contain less hydrogen than\r\nexpressed by the formula C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2} are capable of combining\r\nwith hydrogen, chlorine, certain acids, &c.\r\n\r\nIf the law of substitution gives a very simple explanation of the\r\nformation of hydrogen peroxide as a compound containing two aqueous\r\nresidues (OH)(OH), then on the basis of this law all hydrocarbons\r\nought to be derived from methane, CH_{4}, as being the simplest\r\nhydrocarbon.[36] The increase in complexity of a molecule of methane\r\nis brought about by the faculty of mutual combination which exists in\r\nthe atoms of carbon, and, as a consequence of the most detailed study\r\nof the subject, much that might have been foreseen and conjectured\r\nfrom the law of substitution has been actually brought about in such\r\na manner as might have been predicted, and although this subject on\r\naccount of its magnitude really belongs, as has been already stated,\r\nto the sphere of organic chemistry, it has been alluded to here in\r\norder to show, although only in part, the best investigated example of\r\nthe application of the law of substitution. According to this law, a\r\nmolecule of methane, CH_{4}, is capable of undergoing substitution in\r\nthe four following ways:--(1) Methyl substitution, when the radicle,\r\nequivalent to hydrogen, called _methyl_ CH_{3}, replaces hydrogen.\r\nIn CH_{4} this radicle is combined with H and therefore can replace\r\nit, as (OH) replaces H because with it it gives water; (2) methylene\r\nsubstitution, or the exchange between H_{2} and CH_{2} (this radicle\r\nis called methylene), is founded on a similar division of the molecule\r\nCH_{4} into two equivalent parts, H_{2} and CH_{2}; (3) acetylene\r\nsubstitution, or the exchange between CH on the one hand and H_{3}\r\non the other; and (4) carbon substitution--that is, the substitution\r\nof H_{4} by an atom of carbon C, which is founded on the law of\r\nsubstitution just as is the methyl substitution. These four cases of\r\nsubstitution render it possible to understand the principal relations of\r\nthe hydrocarbons. For instance, the _law of even numbers_ is seen from\r\nthe fact that in all the cases of substitution mentioned the hydrogen\r\natoms increase or decrease by an even number; but as in CH_{4} they are\r\nlikewise even, it follows that no matter how many substitutions are\r\neffected there will always be obtained an even number of hydrogen atoms.\r\nWhen H is replaced by CH_{3} there is an increase of CH_{2}; when H_{2}\r\nis replaced by CH_{2} there is no increase of hydrogen; in the acetylene\r\nsubstitution CH replaces H_{3}, therefore there is an increase of C and\r\na decrease of H_{2}; in the carbon substitution there is a decrease\r\nof H_{4}. In a similar way the _law of limit_ may be deduced as a\r\ncorollary of the law of substitution. For the largest possible quantity\r\nof hydrogen is introduced by the methyl substitution, since it leads\r\nto the addition of CH_{2}; starting from CH_{4} we obtain C_{2}H_{6},\r\nC_{3}H_{8}, and in general, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}, and these contain\r\nthe greatest possible amount of hydrogen. Unsaturated hydrocarbons,\r\ncontaining less hydrogen, are evidently only formed when the increase\r\nof the new molecule derived from methane proceeds from one of the\r\nother forms of substitution. When the methyl substitution alone takes\r\nplace in methane, CH_{4}, it is evident that the saturated hydrocarbon\r\nformed is C_{2}H_{6} or (CH_{3})(CH_{3}).[37] This is called _ethane_.\r\nBy means of the methylene substitution alone, _ethylene_, C_{2}H_{4},\r\nor (CH_{2})(CH_{2}) may be directly obtained from CH_{4}, and by the\r\nacetylene substitution C_{2}H_{2} or (CH)(CH), or _acetylene_, both the\r\nlatter being unsaturated hydrocarbons. Thus we have all the possible\r\nhydrocarbons with two atoms of carbon in the molecule, C_{2}H_{6},\r\nethane, C_{2}H_{4}, ethylene, and C_{2}H_{2}, acetylene. But in them,\r\naccording to the law of substitution, the same forms of substitution may\r\nbe repeated--that is, the methyl, methylene, acetylene, and even carbon\r\nsubstitutions (because C_{2}H_{6} will still contain hydrogen when C\r\nreplaces H_{4}) and therefore further substitutions will serve as a\r\nsource for the production of a fresh series of saturated and unsaturated\r\nhydrocarbons, containing more and more carbon in the molecule and,\r\nin the case of the acetylene substitution and carbon substitution,\r\ncontaining less and less hydrogen. Thus _by means of the law of\r\nsubstitution we can foresee_ not only the limit C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2},\r\nbut an unlimited number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_},\r\nC_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2} ... C_{_n_}H_{2(_n-m_)}, where _m_ varies from 0\r\nto _n_-1,[38] and where _n_ increases indefinitely. From these facts\r\nnot only does the existence of a multitude of polymeric hydrocarbons,\r\ndiffering in molecular weight, become intelligible, but it is also\r\nseen that there is a possibility of cases of isomerism with the same\r\nmolecular weight. This _polymerism_ so common to hydrocarbon compounds\r\nis already apparent in the first unsaturated series C_{_n_}H_{2_n_},\r\nbecause all the terms of this series C_{2}H_{4}, C_{3}H_{6}, C_{4}H_{8}\r\n... C_{30}H_{60} ... have one and the same composition CH_{2}, but\r\ndifferent molecular weights, as has been already explained in Chapter\r\nVII. The differences in the vapour density, boiling points, and\r\nmelting points, of the quantities entering into reactions,[39] and the\r\nmethods of preparation[40] also so clearly tally with the conception\r\nof polymerism, that this example will always be the clearest and most\r\nconclusive for the illustration of polymerism and molecular weight.\r\nSuch a case is also met with among other hydrocarbons. Thus benzene,\r\nC_{6}H_{6}, and cinnamene, C_{8}H_{8}, correspond with the composition\r\nof acetylene or to a compound of the composition CH.[41] The first boils\r\nat 81°, the second at 144°; the specific gravity of the first is 0·899;\r\nthat of the second, 0·925, at 0°--that is, here also the boiling point\r\nrises with the increase of molecular weight, and so also, as might be\r\nexpected, does the density.\r\n\r\n  [36] Methylene, CH_{2}, does not exist. When attempts are made to\r\n       obtain it (for example, by removing X_{2} from CH_{2}X_{2}),\r\n       C_{2}H_{4} or C_{3}H_{6} are produced--that is to say, it\r\n       undergoes polymerisation.\r\n\r\n  [37] Although the methods of formation and the reactions connected with\r\n       hydrocarbons are not described in this work, because they are\r\n       dealt with in organic chemistry, yet in order to clearly show\r\n       the mechanism of those transformations by which the carbon\r\n       atoms are built up into the molecules of the carbon compounds,\r\n       we here give a general example of reactions of this kind. From\r\n       marsh gas, CH_{4}, on the one hand the substitution of chlorine\r\n       or iodine, CH_{3}Cl, CH_{3}I, for the hydrogen may be effected,\r\n       and on the other hand such metals as sodium may be substituted\r\n       for the hydrogen, _e.g._ CH_{3}Na. These and similar products of\r\n       substitution serve as a means of obtaining other more complex\r\n       substances from given carbon compounds. If we place the two\r\n       above-named products of substitution of marsh gas (metallic and\r\n       haloid) in mutual contact, the metal combines with the halogen,\r\n       forming a very stable compound--namely, common salt, NaCl, and\r\n       the carbon groups which were in combination with them separate in\r\n       mutual combination, as shown by the equation:\r\n\r\n                CH_{3}Cl + CH_{3}Na = NaCl + C_{2}H_{6}.\r\n\r\n       This is the most simple example of the formation of a complex\r\n       hydrocarbon from these radicles. The cause of the reaction must\r\n       be sought for in the property which the haloid (chlorine) and\r\n       sodium have of entering into mutual combination.\r\n\r\n  [38] When _m_ = _n_-1, we have the series C_{_n_}H_{2}. The lowest\r\n       member is acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}. These are hydrocarbons\r\n       containing a minimum amount of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [39] For instance, ethylene, C_{2}H_{4}, combines with Br_{2}, HI,\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4}, as a whole molecule, as also does amylene,\r\n       C_{5}H_{10}, and, in general, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}.\r\n\r\n  [40] For instance, ethylene is obtained by removing the water from\r\n       ethyl alcohol, C_{2}H_{5}(OH), and amylene, C_{5}H_{10}, from\r\n       amyl alcohol, C_{5}H_{11}(OH), or in general C_{_n_}H_{2_n_},\r\n       from C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+1}(OH).\r\n\r\n  [41] Acetylene and its polymerides have an empirical composition CH,\r\n       ethylene and its homologues (and polymerides) CH_{2}, ethane\r\n       CH_{3}, methane CH_{4}. This series presents a good example of\r\n       the law of multiple proportions, but such diverse proportions\r\n       are met with between the number of atoms of the carbon and\r\n       hydrogen in the hydrocarbons already known that the accuracy of\r\n       Dalton's law might be doubted. Thus the substances C_{30}H_{62}\r\n       and C_{30}H_{60} differ so slightly in their composition by\r\n       weight as to be within the limits of experimental error, but\r\n       their reactions and properties are so distinct that they can be\r\n       distinguished beyond a doubt. Without Dalton's law chemistry\r\n       could not have been brought to its present condition, but it\r\n       cannot alone express all those gradations which are quite clearly\r\n       understood and predicted by the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.\r\n\r\nCases of isomerism in the restricted sense of the word--that is,\r\nwhen with an identity of composition and of molecular weight, the\r\nproperties of the substances are different--are very numerous among\r\nthe hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Such cases are particularly\r\nimportant for the comprehension of molecular structure and they also,\r\nlike the polymerides, may be predicted from the above-mentioned\r\nconceptions, expressing the principles of the structure of the carbon\r\ncompounds[42] based on the law of substitution. According to it, for\r\nexample, it is evident that there can be no isomerism in the cases\r\nof the saturated hydrocarbons C_{2}H_{6} and C_{3}H_{8}, because the\r\nformer is CH_{4}, in which methyl has taken the place of H, and as\r\nall the hydrogen atoms of methane must be supposed to have the same\r\nrelation to the carbon, it is all the same which of them be subjected\r\nto the methyl substitution--the resulting product can only be ethane,\r\nCH_{3}CH_{3};[43] the same argument also applies in the case of propane,\r\nCH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{3}, where one compound only can be imagined. It is to\r\nbe expected, however, that there should be two butanes, C_{4}H_{10}, and\r\nthis is actually the case. In one, methyl may be considered as replacing\r\nthe hydrogen of one of the methyls, CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{3}; and in\r\nthe other CH_{3} may be considered as substituted for H in /CH_{3}\r\nCH_{2}, and there it will consist of CH_{3}CH. The latter may \\CH_{3}\r\nalso be regarded as methane in which three of hydrogen are exchanged\r\nfor three of methyl. On going further in the series it is evident that\r\nthe number of possible isomerides will be still greater, but we have\r\nlimited ourselves to the simplest examples, showing the possibility and\r\nactual existence of isomerides. C_{2}H_{4} and CH_{2}CH_{2} are, it is\r\nevident, identical; but there ought to be, and are, two hydrocarbons of\r\nthe composition C_{3}H_{6}, propylene and trimethylene; the first is\r\nethylene, CH_{2}CH_{2}, in which one atom of hydrogen is exchanged for\r\nmethyl, CH_{2}CHCH_{3}, and trimethylene is ethane, CH_{3}CH_{3}, with\r\nthe substitution of methylene for two hydrogen atoms from two methyl\r\ngroups--that /CH_{2} is, CH_{2},[44] where the methylene introduced\r\nis united to both \\CH_{2} the atoms of carbon in CH_{3}CH_{3}. It is\r\nevident that the cause of isomerism here is, on the one hand, the\r\ndifference of the amount of hydrogen in union with the particular\r\natoms of carbon, and, on the other, the different connection between\r\nthe several atoms of carbon. In the first case they may be said to\r\nbe chained together (more usually to form an 'open chain'), and in\r\nthe second case, to be locked together (to form a 'closed chain'\r\nor 'ring'). Here also it is easily understood that on increasing\r\nthe quantity of carbon atoms the number of possible and existing\r\nisomerides will greatly increase. If, at the same time, in addition\r\nto the substitution of one of the radicles of methane for hydrogen a\r\nfurther exchange of part of the hydrogen for some of the other groups\r\nof elements X, Y ... occurs, the quantity of possible isomerides still\r\nfurther increases in a considerable degree. For instance, there are\r\neven two possible isomerides for the derivatives of ethane, C_{2}H_{6}:\r\nif two atoms of the hydrogen be exchanged for X_{2}, one will have\r\nthe ethylene structure, CH_{2}XCH_{2}X, and the other an ethylidene\r\nstructure, CH_{3}CHX_{2}; such are, for instance, ethylene chloride,\r\nCH_{2}ClCH_{2}Cl, and ethylidene chloride, CH_{3}CHCl_{2}. And as in the\r\nplace of the first atom of hydrogen not only metals may be substituted,\r\nbut Cl, Br, I, OH (the water radicle), NH_{2} (the ammonia radicle),\r\nNO_{2} (the radicle of nitric acid), &c., so also in exchange for two\r\natoms of hydrogen O, NH, S, &c., may be substituted; hence it will be\r\nunderstood that the quantity of isomerides is sometimes very great. It\r\nis impossible here to describe how the isomerides are distinguished\r\nfrom each other, in what reactions they occur, how and when one changes\r\ninto another, &c.; for this, taken together with the description of\r\nthe hydrocarbons already known, and their derivatives, forms a very\r\nextensive and very thoroughly investigated branch of chemistry, called\r\n_organic chemistry_. Enriched with a mass of closely observed phenomena\r\nand strictly deduced generalisations, this branch of chemistry has\r\nbeen treated separately for the reason that in it the hydrocarbon\r\ngroups are subjected to transformations which are not met with in such\r\nquantity in dealing with any of the other elements or their hydrogen\r\ncompounds. It was important for us to show that notwithstanding the\r\ngreat variety of the hydrocarbons and their products,[45] they are all\r\nof them governed by the law of substitution, and referring our readers\r\nfor detailed information to works on organic chemistry, we will limit\r\nourselves to a short exposition of the properties of the two simplest\r\nunsaturated hydrocarbons: ethylene, CH_{2}CH_{2}, and acetylene, CHCH,\r\nand a short acquaintance with petroleum as the natural source of a mass\r\nof hydrocarbons. _Ethylene, or olefiant gas_, C_{2}H_{4}, is the lowest\r\nknown member of the unsaturated hydrocarbon series of the composition\r\nC_{_n_}H_{2_n_}. As in composition it is equal to two molecules of marsh\r\ngas deprived of two molecules of hydrogen, it is evident that it might\r\nbe, and it actually can be, produced, although but in small quantities,\r\ntogether with hydrogen, by heating marsh gas. On being heated, however,\r\nolefiant gas splits up, first into acetylene and methane (3C_{2}H_{4} =\r\n2C_{2}H_{2} + 2CH_{4}, Lewes, 1894), and at a higher temperature into\r\ncarbon and hydrogen; and therefore in those cases where marsh gas is\r\nproduced by heating, olefiant gas, hydrogen, and charcoal will also be\r\nformed, although only in small quantities. The lower the temperature at\r\nwhich complex organic substances are heated, the greater the quantity\r\nof olefiant gas found in the gases given off; at a white heat it is\r\nentirely decomposed into charcoal and marsh gas. If coal, wood, and more\r\nparticularly petroleum, tars, and fatty substances, are subjected to dry\r\ndistillation, they give off illuminating gas, which contains more or\r\nless olefiant gas.\r\n\r\n  [42] The conception of the structure of carbon compounds--that is, the\r\n       expression of those unions and correlations which their atoms\r\n       have in the molecules--was for a long time limited to the\r\n       representation that organic substances contained complex\r\n       radicles (for instance, ethyl C_{2}H_{5}, methyl CH_{3}, phenyl\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}, &c.); then about the year 1840 the phenomena\r\n       of substitution and the correspondence of the products of\r\n       substitution with the primary bodies (nuclei and types) were\r\n       observed, but it was not until about the year 1860 and later when\r\n       on the one hand the teaching of Gerhardt about molecules was\r\n       spreading, and on the other hand the materials had accumulated\r\n       for discussing the transformations of the simplest hydrocarbon\r\n       compounds, that conjectures began to appear as to the mutual\r\n       connection of the atoms of carbon in the molecules of the complex\r\n       hydrocarbon compounds. Then Kekulé and A. M. Butleroff began to\r\n       formulate the connection between the separate atoms of carbon,\r\n       regarding it as a quadrivalent element. Although in their\r\n       methods of expression and in some of their views they differ\r\n       from each other and also from the way in which the subject is\r\n       treated in this work, yet the essence of the matter--namely,\r\n       the comprehension of the causes of isomerism and of the union\r\n       between the separate atoms of carbon--remains the same. In\r\n       addition to this, starting from the year 1870, there appears a\r\n       tendency which from year to year increases to discover the actual\r\n       spacial distribution of the atoms in the molecules. Thanks to the\r\n       endeavours of Le-Bel (1874), Van't Hoff (1874), and Wislicenus\r\n       (1887) in observing cases of isomerism--such as the effect of\r\n       different isomerides on the direction of the rotation of the\r\n       plane of polarisation of light--this tendency promises much\r\n       for chemical mechanics, but the details of the still imperfect\r\n       knowledge in relation to this matter must be sought for in\r\n       special works devoted to organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [43] Direct experiment shows that however CH_{3}X is prepared (where\r\n       X = for instance Cl, &c.) it is always one and the same\r\n       substance. If, for example, in CX_{4}, X is gradually replaced by\r\n       hydrogen until CH_{3}X is produced, or in CH_{4}, the hydrogen by\r\n       various means is replaced by X, or else, for instance, if CH_{3}X\r\n       be obtained by the decomposition of more complex compounds, the\r\n       same product is always obtained.\r\n\r\n       This was shown in the year 1860, or thereabout, by many methods,\r\n       and is the fundamental conception of the structure of hydrocarbon\r\n       compounds. If the atoms of hydrogen in methyl were not absolutely\r\n       identical in value and position (as they are not, for instance,\r\n       in CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{3} or CH_{3}CH_{2}X), then there would be as\r\n       many different forms of CH_{3}X as there were diversities in the\r\n       atoms of hydrogen in CH_{4}. The scope of this work does not\r\n       permit of a more detailed account of this matter. It is given in\r\n       works on organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [44] The union of carbon atoms in closed chains or rings was first\r\n       suggested by Kekulé as an explanation of the structure and\r\n       isomerism of the derivatives of benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, forming\r\n       aromatic compounds (Note 26).\r\n\r\n  [45] The following are the most generally known of the oxygenised but\r\n       non-nitrogenous hydrocarbon derivatives. (1) the alcohols. These\r\n       are hydrocarbons in which hydrogen is exchanged for hydroxyl\r\n       (OH). The simplest of these is methyl alcohol, CH_{3}(OH),\r\n       or wood spirit obtained by the dry distillation of wood. The\r\n       common spirits of wine or ethyl alcohol, C_{2}H_{3}(OH), and\r\n       glycol, C_{2}H_{4}(OH)_{2}, correspond with ethane. Normal\r\n       propyl alcohol, CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2}(OH), and isopropyl alcohol,\r\n       CH_{3}CH(OH)CH_{3}, propylene-glycol, C_{3}H_{6}(OH)_{2}, and\r\n       glycerol, C_{3}H_{3}(OH)_{3} (which, with stearic and other\r\n       acids, forms fatty substances), correspond with propane,\r\n       C_{3}H_{8}. All alcohols are capable of forming water and\r\n       ethereal salts with acids, just as alkalis form ordinary salts.\r\n       (2) Aldehydes are alcohols minus hydrogen; for instance,\r\n       acetaldehyde, C_{2}H_{4}O, corresponds with ethyl alcohol.\r\n       (3) It is simplest to regard organic acids as hydrocarbons in\r\n       which hydrogen has been exchanged for carboxyl (CO_{2}H), as\r\n       will be explained in the following chapter. There are a number\r\n       of intermediate compounds; for example, the aldehyde-alcohols,\r\n       alcohol-acids (or hydroxy-acids), &c. Thus the hydroxy-acids are\r\n       hydrocarbons in which some of the hydrogen has been replaced\r\n       by hydroxyl, and some by carboxyl; for instance, lactic\r\n       acid corresponds with C_{2}H_{6}, and has the constitution\r\n       C_{2}H_{4}(OH)(CO_{2}H). If to these products we add the haloid\r\n       salts (where H is replaced by Cl, Br, I), the nitro-compounds\r\n       containing NO_{2} in place of H, the amides, cyanides, ketones,\r\n       and other compounds, it will be readily seen what an immense\r\n       number of organic compounds there are and what a variety of\r\n       properties these substances have; this we see also from the\r\n       composition of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nOlefiant gas, almost free from other gases,[46] may be obtained from\r\nordinary alcohol (if possible, free from water) if it be mixed with\r\nfive parts of strong sulphuric acid and the mixture heated to slightly\r\nabove 100°. Under these conditions, the sulphuric acid removes the\r\nelements of water from the alcohol, C_{2}H_{5}(OH), and gives olefiant\r\ngas; C_{2}H_{6}O = H_{2}O + C_{2}H_{4}. The greater molecular weight\r\nof olefiant gas compared with marsh gas indicates that it may be\r\ncomparatively easily converted into a liquid by means of pressure or\r\ngreat cold; this may be effected, for example, by the evaporation\r\nof liquid nitrous oxide. Its absolute boiling point is +10°, it\r\nboils at -103° (1 atmosphere), liquefies at 0°, at a pressure of 43\r\natmospheres, and solidifies at -160°. Ethylene is colourless, has a\r\nslight ethereal smell, is slightly soluble in water, and somewhat more\r\nsoluble in alcohol and in ether (in five volumes of spirit and six\r\nvolumes of ether).[47]\r\n\r\n  [46] Ethylene bromide, C_{2}H_{4}Br_{2}, when gently heated in\r\n       alcoholic solution with finely divided zinc, yields pure\r\n       ethylene, the zinc merely taking up the bromine (Sabaneyeff).\r\n\r\n  [47] Ethylene decomposes somewhat easily under the influence of the\r\n       electric spark, or a high temperature. In this case the volume\r\n       of the gas formed may remain the same when olefiant gas is\r\n       decomposed into carbon and marsh gas, or may increase to double\r\n       its volume when hydrogen and carbon are formed, C_{2}H_{4} =\r\n       CH_{4} + C = 2C + 2H_{2}. A mixture of olefiant gas and oxygen is\r\n       highly explosive; two volumes of this gas require six volumes of\r\n       oxygen for its perfect combustion. The eight volumes thus taken\r\n       then resolve themselves into eight volumes of the products of\r\n       combustion, a mixture of water and carbonic anhydride, C_{2}H_{4}\r\n       + 3O_{2} = 2CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O. On cooling after the explosion\r\n       diminution of volume occurs because the water becomes liquid. For\r\n       two volumes of the olefiant gas taken, the diminution will be\r\n       equal to four volumes, and the same for marsh gas. The quantity\r\n       of carbonic anhydride formed by both gases is not the same. Two\r\n       volumes of marsh gas give only two volumes of carbonic anhydride,\r\n       and two volumes of ethylene give four volumes of carbonic\r\n       anhydride.\r\n\r\nLike other unsaturated hydrocarbons, olefiant gas readily enters into\r\ncombination with certain substances, such as chlorine, bromine, iodine,\r\nfuming sulphuric acid, or sulphuric anhydride, &c. If olefiant gas be\r\nsealed up with a small quantity of sulphuric acid in a glass vessel, and\r\nconstantly agitated (as, for instance, by attaching it to the moving\r\npart of a machine), the prolonged contact and repeated mixing causes\r\nthe olefiant gas, little by little, to combine with the sulphuric acid,\r\nforming C_{2}H_{4}H_{2}SO_{4}. If, after this absorption, the sulphuric\r\nacid be diluted with water and distilled, alcohol separates, which is\r\nproduced in this case by the olefiant gas combining with the elements of\r\nwater, C_{2}H_{4} + H_{2}O = C_{2}H_{6}O. In this reaction (Berthelot)\r\nwe see an excellent example of the fact that if a given substance, like\r\nolefiant gas, is produced by the decomposition of another, then in the\r\nreverse way this substance, entering into combination, is capable of\r\nforming the original substance--in our example, alcohol. In combination\r\nwith various molecules, X_{2}, ethylene gives saturated compounds,\r\nC_{2}H_{4}X_{2} or CH_{2}XCH_{2}X (for example, C_{2}H_{4}Cl_{2}), which\r\ncorrespond with ethane, CH_{3}CH_{3} or C_{2}H_{6}.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] The homologues of ethylene, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}, are also capable\r\n       of direct combination with halogens, &c., but with various\r\n       degrees of facility. The composition of these homologues can be\r\n       expressed thus: (CH_{3})__x_(CH_{2})_{_y_}(CH)_{_z_}C_{_r_},\r\n       where the sum of _x_ + _z_ is always an even number, and\r\n       the sum of _x_ + _z_ + _r_ is equal to half the sum of\r\n       3_x_ + _z_, whence _z_ + 2_r_ = _x_; by this means the possible\r\n       isomerides are determined. For example, for butylenes,\r\n       C_{4}H_{8}, (CH_{3})_{2}(CH)_{2}, (CH_{3})_{2}(CH_{2})C,\r\n       (CH_{2})(CH_{2})_{2}CH, and (CH_{2})_{4} are possible.\r\n\r\n_Acetylene_, C_{2}H_{2} = CHCH, is a gas; it was first prepared by\r\nBerthelot (1857). It has a very pungent smell, is characterised by\r\nits great stability under the action of heat, and is obtained as the\r\nonly product of the direct combination of carbon with hydrogen when a\r\nluminous arc (voltaic) is formed between carbon electrodes. This arc\r\ncontains particles of carbon passing from one pole to the other. If the\r\ncarbons be surrounded with an atmosphere of hydrogen, the carbon in part\r\ncombines with the hydrogen, forming C_{2}H_{2}.[48 bis] Acetylene may be\r\nformed from olefiant gas if two atoms of hydrogen be taken from it. This\r\nmay be effected in the following way: the olefiant gas is first made to\r\ncombine with bromine, giving C_{2}H_{4}Br_{2}; from this the hydrobromic\r\nacid is removed by means of an alcoholic solution of caustic potash,\r\nleaving the volatile product C_{2}H_{3}Br; and from this yet another\r\npart of hydrobromic acid is withdrawn by passing it through anhydrous\r\nalcohol in which metallic sodium has been dissolved, or by heating\r\nit with a strong alcoholic solution of caustic potash. Under these\r\ncircumstances (Berthelot, Sawitsch, Miasnikoff) the alkali takes up the\r\nhydrobromic acid from C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-1}Br, forming C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2}.\r\n\r\n  [48 bis] _See_ also method of preparing C_{2}H_{2} in Note 12 bis.\r\n\r\nAcetylene is also produced in all those cases where organic substances\r\nare decomposed by the action of a high temperature--for example, by dry\r\ndistillation. On this account a certain quantity is always found in coal\r\ngas, and gives to it, at all events in part, its peculiar smell, but\r\nthe quantity of acetylene in coal gas is very small. If the vapour of\r\nalcohol be passed through a heated tube a certain quantity of acetylene\r\nis formed. It is also produced by the imperfect combustion of olefiant\r\nand marsh gas--for example, if the flame of coal gas has not free access\r\nto air.[49] The inner part of every flame contains gases in imperfect\r\ncombustion, and in them some amount of acetylene.\r\n\r\n  [49] This is easily accomplished with those gas burners which are used\r\n       in laboratories and mentioned in the Introduction. In these\r\n       burners the gas is first mixed with air in a long tube, above\r\n       which it is kindled. But if it be lighted inside the pipe it\r\n       does not burn completely, but forms acetylene, on account of\r\n       the cooling effect of the walls of the metallic tube; this is\r\n       detected by the smell, and may be shown by passing the issuing\r\n       gas (by aid of an aspirator) into an ammoniacal solution of\r\n       cuprous chloride.\r\n\r\nAcetylene, being further removed than ethylene from the limit\r\nC_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2} of hydrocarbon compounds, has a still greater\r\nfaculty of combination than is shown by olefiant gas, and therefore can\r\nbe more readily separated from any mixture containing it. Actually,\r\nacetylene not only combines with one and two molecules of I_{2}, HI,\r\nH_{2}SO_{4}, Cl_{2}, Br_{2}, &c.... (many other unsaturated hydrocarbons\r\ncombine with them), but also with cuprous chloride, CuCl, forming a red\r\nprecipitate. If a gaseous mixture containing acetylene be passed through\r\nan ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride (or silver nitrate), the\r\nother gases do not combine, but the acetylene gives a red precipitate\r\n(or grey with silver), which detonates when struck with a hammer. This\r\nred precipitate gives off acetylene under the action of acids. In this\r\nmanner pure acetylene may be obtained. Acetylene and its homologues also\r\nreadily react with corrosive sublimate, HgCl_{2} (Koucheroff, Favorsky).\r\nAcetylene burns with a very brilliant flame, which is accounted for by\r\nthe comparatively large amount of carbon it contains.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Amongst the homologues of acetylene C_{_n_}H_{2_n_-2}, the lowest\r\n       is C_{3}H_{4}; allylene, CH_{3}CCH, and allene, CH_{2}CCH_{2},\r\n       are known, but the closed structure, CH_{2}(CH)_{2}, is little\r\n       investigated.\r\n\r\nThe formation and existence in nature of large masses of petroleum or a\r\nmixture of liquid hydrocarbons, principally of the series C_{_n_}H_{2_n_\r\n+2} and C_{_n_}H_{2_n_} is in many respects remarkable.[51] In some\r\nmountainous districts--as, for instance, by the slopes of the Caucasian\r\nchain, on inclines lying in a direction parallel to the range--an oily\r\nliquid issues from the earth together with salt water and hot gases\r\n(methane and others); it has a tarry smell and dark brown colour,\r\nand is lighter than water. This liquid is called naphtha or rock oil\r\n(petroleum) and is obtained in large quantities by sinking wells and\r\ndeep bore-holes in those places where traces of naphtha are observed,\r\nthe naphtha being sometimes thrown up from the wells in fountains of\r\nconsiderable height.[52] The evolution of naphtha is always accompanied\r\nby salt water and marsh gas. Naphtha has from ancient times been\r\nworked in Russia in the Apsheron peninsula near Baku, and is also\r\nnow worked in Burmah (India), in Galicia near the Carpathians, and\r\nin America, especially in Pennsylvania and Canada, &c. Naphtha does\r\nnot consist of one definite hydrocarbon, but of a mixture of several,\r\nand its density, external appearance, and other qualities vary with\r\nthe amount of the different hydrocarbons of which it is composed.\r\nThe light kinds of naphtha have a specific gravity about 0·8 and the\r\nheavy kinds up to 0·98. The former are very mobile liquids, and more\r\nvolatile; the latter contain less of the volatile hydrocarbons and are\r\nless mobile. When the light kinds of naphtha are distilled, the boiling\r\npoint taken in the vapours constantly changes, beginning at 0° and\r\ngoing up to above 350°. That which passes over first is a very mobile,\r\ncolourless ethereal liquid (forming gazolene, ligroin, benzoline,\r\n&c.), from which the hydrocarbons whose boiling points start from 0°\r\nmay be extracted--namely, the hydrocarbons C_{4}H_{10}, C_{5}H_{12}\r\n(which boils at 30°), C_{6}H_{14} (boils at 62°), C_{7}H_{16} (boils\r\nabout 90°), &c. Those fractions of the naphtha distillate which boil\r\nabove 130°, and contain hydrocarbons with C_{9}, C_{10}, C_{11}, &c.,\r\nenter into the composition of the oily substance, universally used\r\nfor lighting, called kerosene or photogen or photonaphthalene, and by\r\nother names. The specific gravity of kerosene is from 0·78 to 0·84, and\r\nit smells like naphtha. Those products of the distillation of naphtha\r\nwhich pass off below 130° and have a specific gravity below 0·75,\r\nenter into the composition of light petroleum (benzoline, ligroin,\r\npetroleum spirit, &c.); which is used as a solvent for india-rubber,\r\nfor removing grease spots, &c. Those portions of naphtha (which can\r\nonly be distilled without change by means of superheated steam,\r\notherwise they are largely decomposed) which boil above 275° and up to\r\n300° and have a specific gravity higher than 0·85, form an excellent\r\noil,[53] safe as regards inflammability (which is very important\r\nas diminishing the risks of fire), and may be used in lamps as an\r\neffective substitute for kerosene.[54] Those portions of naphtha which\r\npass over at a still higher temperature and have a higher specific\r\ngravity than 0·9, which are found in abundance (about 30 p.c.) in the\r\nBaku naphtha, make excellent lubricating or machine oils. Naphtha has\r\nmany important applications, and the naphtha industry is now of great\r\ncommercial importance, especially as naphtha and its refuse may be\r\nused as fuel.[55] Whether naphtha was formed from organic matter is\r\nvery doubtful, as it is found in the most ancient Silurian strata\r\nwhich correspond with epochs of the earth's existence when there was\r\nlittle organic matter; it could not penetrate from the higher to the\r\nlower (more ancient) strata as it floats on water (and water penetrates\r\nthrough all strata). It therefore tends to rise to the surface of the\r\nearth, and it is always found in highlands parallel to the direction of\r\nthe mountains.[56] Much more probably its formation may be attributed\r\nto the action of water penetrating through the crevasses formed on\r\nthe mountain slopes and reaching to the heart of the earth, to that\r\nkernel of heated metallic matter which must be accepted as existing in\r\nthe interior of the earth. And as meteoric iron often contains carbon\r\n(like cast iron), so, accepting the existence of such carburetted\r\niron at unattainable depths in the interior of the earth, it may be\r\nsupposed that naphtha was produced by the action of water penetrating\r\nthrough the crevices of the strata during the upheaval of mountain\r\nchains,[57] because water with iron carbide ought to give iron oxide\r\nand hydrocarbons.[58] Direct experiment proves that the so-called\r\n_spiegeleisen_ (manganiferous iron, rich in chemically combined\r\ncarbon) when treated with acids gives liquid hydrocarbons[59] which in\r\ncomposition, appearance, and properties are completely identical with\r\nnaphtha.[60]\r\n\r\n  [51] The saturated hydrocarbons predominate in American petroleum,\r\n       especially in its more volatile parts; in Baku naphtha the\r\n       hydrocarbons of the composition C_{_n_}H_{2_n_} form the\r\n       main part (Lisenko, Markovnikoff, Beilstein) but doubtless\r\n       (Mendeléeff) it also contains saturated ones, C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2}.\r\n       The structure of the naphtha hydrocarbons is only known for\r\n       the lower homologues, but doubtless the distinction between the\r\n       hydrocarbons of the Pennsylvanian and Baku naphthas, boiling at\r\n       the same temperature (after the requisite refining by repeated\r\n       fractional distillation, which can be very conveniently done\r\n       by means of steam rectification--that is, by passing the steam\r\n       through the dense mass), depends not only on the predominance\r\n       of saturated hydrocarbons in the former, and naphthenes,\r\n       C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}, in the latter, but also on the diversity of\r\n       composition and structure of the corresponding portions of the\r\n       distillation. The products of the Baku naphtha are richer in\r\n       carbon (therefore in a suitably constructed lamp they ought to\r\n       give a brighter light), they are of greater specific gravity, and\r\n       have greater internal friction (and are therefore more suitable\r\n       for lubricating machinery) than the American products collected\r\n       at the same temperature.\r\n\r\n  [52] The formation of naphtha fountains (which burst forth after the\r\n       higher clay strata covering the layers of sands impregnated\r\n       with naphtha have been bored through) is without doubt caused\r\n       by the pressure or tension of the combustible hydrocarbon\r\n       gases which accompany the naphtha, and are soluble in it under\r\n       pressure. Sometimes these naphtha fountains reach a height of 100\r\n       metres--for instance, the fountain of 1887 near Baku. Naphtha\r\n       fountains generally act periodically and their force diminishes\r\n       with the lapse of time, which might be expected, because the\r\n       gases which cause the fountains find an outlet, as the naphtha\r\n       issuing from the bore-hole carries away the sand which was\r\n       partially choking it up.\r\n\r\n  [53] This is a so-called intermediate oil (between kerosene and\r\n       lubricating oils), solar oil, or pyronaphtha. Lamps are already\r\n       being manufactured for burning it but still require improvement.\r\n       Above all, however, it requires a more extended market, and\r\n       this at present is wanting, owing to the two following reasons:\r\n       (1) Those products of the American petroleum which are the\r\n       most widely spread and almost universally consumed contain but\r\n       little of this intermediate oil, and what there is is divided\r\n       between the kerosene and the lubricating oils; (2) the Baku\r\n       naphtha, which is capable of yielding a great deal (up to 30\r\n       p.c.) of intermediate oil, is produced in enormous quantities,\r\n       about 300 million poods, but has no regular markets abroad,\r\n       and for the consumption in Russia (about 25 million poods of\r\n       kerosene per annum) and for the limited export (60 million\r\n       poods per annum) into Western Europe (by the Trans-Caucasian\r\n       Railway) those volatile and more dangerous parts of the naphtha\r\n       which enter into the composition of the American petroleum are\r\n       sufficient, although Baku naphtha yields about 25 p.c. of such\r\n       kerosene. For this reason pyronaphtha is not manufactured in\r\n       sufficient quantities, and the whole world is consuming the\r\n       unsafe kerosene. When a pipe line has been laid from Baku to the\r\n       Black Sea (in America there are many which carry the raw naphtha\r\n       to the sea-shore, where it is made into kerosene and other\r\n       products) then the whole mass of the Baku naphtha will furnish\r\n       safe illuminating oils, which without doubt will find an immense\r\n       application. A mixture of the intermediate oil with kerosene\r\n       or Baku oil (specific gravity 0·84 to 0·85) may be considered\r\n       (on removing the benzoline) to be the best illuminating oil,\r\n       because it is safe (flashing point from 40° to 60°), cheaper\r\n       (Baku naphtha gives as much as 60 p.c. of Baku oil), and burns\r\n       perfectly well in lamps differing but little from those made for\r\n       burning American kerosene (unsafe, flashing point 20° to 30°).\r\n\r\n  [54] The substitution of Baku pyronaphtha, or intermediate oil, or Baku\r\n       oil (_see_ Note 53), would not only be a great advantage as\r\n       regards safety from fire, but would also be highly economical.\r\n       A ton (62 poods) of American crude petroleum costs at the coast\r\n       considerably more than 24_s._ (12 roubles), and yields two-thirds\r\n       of a ton of kerosene suitable for ordinary lamps. A ton of raw\r\n       naphtha in Baku costs less than 4_s._ (1 rouble 80 copecks), and\r\n       with a pipe line to the shore of the Black Sea would not cost\r\n       more than 8 roubles, or 16_s._ Moreover, a ton of Baku naphtha\r\n       will yield as much as two-thirds of a ton of kerosene, Baku oil,\r\n       and pyronaphtha suitable for illuminating purposes.\r\n\r\n  [55] Naphtha has been applied for heating purposes on a large scale\r\n       in Russia, not only on account of the low cost of naphtha itself\r\n       and of the residue from the preparation of kerosene, but also\r\n       because the products of all the Baku naphtha do not find an\r\n       outlet for general consumption. Naphtha itself and its various\r\n       residues form excellent fuel, burning without smoke and giving\r\n       a high temperature (steel and iron may be easily melted in the\r\n       flame). A hundred poods of good coal (for instance, Don coal)\r\n       used as fuel for heating boilers are equivalent to 36 cubic feet\r\n       (about 250 poods) of dry wood, while only 70 poods of naphtha\r\n       will be required; and moreover there is no need for stoking, as\r\n       the liquid can be readily and evenly supplied in the required\r\n       quantity. The economic and other questions relating to American\r\n       and Baku petroleums have been discussed more in detail in some\r\n       separate works of mine (D. Mendeléeff): (1) 'The Naphtha Industry\r\n       of Pennsylvania and the Caucasus,' 1870; (2) 'Where to Build\r\n       Naphtha Works,' 1880; (3) 'On the Naphtha Question,' 1883; (4)\r\n       'The Baku Naphtha Question,' 1886; (5) the article on the naphtha\r\n       industry in the account of the Russian industries printed for the\r\n       Chicago Exhibition.\r\n\r\n  [56] As during the process of the dry distillation of wood, sea-weed,\r\n       and similar vegetable _débris_, and also when fats are decomposed\r\n       by the action of heat (in closed vessels), hydrocarbons similar\r\n       to those of naphtha are formed, it was natural that this fact\r\n       should have been turned to account to explain the formation\r\n       of the latter. But the hypothesis of the formation of naphtha\r\n       from vegetable _débris_ inevitably assumes coal to be the chief\r\n       element of decomposition, and naphtha is met with in Pennsylvania\r\n       and Canada, in the Silurian and Devonian strata, which do not\r\n       contain coal, and correspond to an epoch not abounding in organic\r\n       matter. Coal was formed from the vegetable _débris_ of the\r\n       Carboniferous, Jurassic, and other recent strata, but judging\r\n       more from its composition and structure, it has been subjected\r\n       to the same kind of decomposition as peat; nor could liquid\r\n       hydrocarbons have been thus formed to such an extent as we see\r\n       in naphtha. If we ascribe the derivation of naphtha to the\r\n       decomposition of fat (adipose, animal fat) we encounter three\r\n       almost insuperable difficulties: (1) Animal remains would furnish\r\n       a great deal of nitrogenous matter, whilst there is but very\r\n       little in naphtha; (2) the enormous quantity of naphtha already\r\n       discovered as compared with the insignificant amount of fat in\r\n       the animal carcase; (3) the sources of naphtha always running\r\n       parallel to mountain chains is completely inexplicable. Being\r\n       struck with this last-mentioned circumstance in Pennsylvania,\r\n       and finding that the sources in the Caucasus surround the whole\r\n       Caucasian range (Baku, Tiflis, Gouria, Kouban, Tamman, Groznoe,\r\n       Dagestan), I developed in 1876 the hypothesis of the mineral\r\n       origin of naphtha expounded further on.\r\n\r\n  [57] During the upheaval of mountain ranges crevasses would be formed\r\n       at the peaks with openings upwards, and at the foot of the\r\n       mountains with openings downwards. These cracks in course of time\r\n       fill up, but the younger the mountains the fresher the cracks\r\n       (the Alleghany mountains are, without doubt, more ancient than\r\n       the Caucasian, which were formed during the tertiary epoch);\r\n       through them water must gain access deep into the recesses of the\r\n       earth to an extent that could not occur on the level (on plains).\r\n       The situation of naphtha at the foot of mountain chains is the\r\n       principal argument in my hypothesis.\r\n\r\n       Another fundamental reason is the consideration of the mean\r\n       density of the earth. Cavendish, Airy, Cornu, Boys, and many\r\n       others who have investigated the subject by various methods,\r\n       found that, taking water = 1, the mean density of the earth\r\n       is nearly 5·5. As at the surface water and all rocks (sand,\r\n       clay, limestone, granite, &c.) have a density less than 3, it\r\n       is evident (as solid substances are but slightly compressible\r\n       even under the greatest pressure) that inside the earth there\r\n       are substances of a greater density--indeed, not less than 7\r\n       or 8. What conclusion, then, can be arrived at? Anything heavy\r\n       contained in the bosom of the earth must be distributed not\r\n       only on its surface, but throughout the whole solar system, for\r\n       everything tends to show that the sun and planets are formed from\r\n       the same material, and according to the hypothesis of Laplace\r\n       and Kant it is most probable, and indeed must necessarily be\r\n       held, that the earth and planets are but fragments of the solar\r\n       atmosphere, which have had time to cool considerably and become\r\n       masses semi-liquid inside and solid outside, forming both planets\r\n       and satellites. The sun amongst other heavy elements contains\r\n       a great deal of iron, as shown by spectrum analysis. There is\r\n       also much of it in an oxidised condition on the surface of the\r\n       earth. Meteoric stones, carried as fragmentary planets in the\r\n       solar system and sometimes falling upon the earth, consisting of\r\n       siliceous rocks similar to terrestrial ones, often contain either\r\n       dense masses of iron (for example, the Pallosovo iron preserved\r\n       in the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences) or granular masses\r\n       (for instance, the Okhansk meteorite of 1886). It is therefore\r\n       possible that the interior of the earth contains much iron in a\r\n       metallic state. This might be anticipated from the hypothesis of\r\n       Laplace, for the iron must have been compressed into a liquid\r\n       at that period when the other component parts of the earth\r\n       were still strongly heated, and oxides of iron could not then\r\n       have been formed. The iron was covered with slags (mixtures of\r\n       silicates like glass fused with rocky matter) which did not allow\r\n       it to burn at the expense of the oxygen of the atmosphere or\r\n       of water, just at that time when the temperature of the earth\r\n       was very high. Carbon was in the same state; its oxides were\r\n       also capable of dissociation (Deville); it is also but slightly\r\n       volatile, and has an affinity for iron, and iron carbide is found\r\n       in meteoric stones (as well as carbon and even the diamond). Thus\r\n       the supposition of the existence of iron carbides in the interior\r\n       of the earth was derived by me from many indications, which\r\n       are to some extent confirmed by the fact that granular pieces\r\n       of iron have been found in some basalts (ancient lava) as well\r\n       as in meteoric stones. The occurrence of iron in contact with\r\n       carbon during the formation of the earth is all the more probable\r\n       because those elements predominate in nature which have small\r\n       atomic weights, and among them the most widely diffused, the most\r\n       difficultly fusible, and therefore the most easily condensed\r\n       (Chapter XV.) are carbon and iron. They passed into the liquid\r\n       state when all compounds were at a temperature of dissociation.\r\n\r\n  [58] The following is the typical equation for this formation:\r\n\r\n       3Fe_{_m_}C_{_n_} + 4_{_m_}H_{2}O = _m_Fe_{3}O_{4} (magnetic\r\n       oxide) + C_{5_n_}H_{8_m_} (_see_ Chapter XVII., Note 38).\r\n\r\n  [59] Cloez investigated the hydrocarbons formed when cast-iron is\r\n       dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and found C_{_n_}H_{2_n_} and\r\n       others. I treated crystalline manganiferous cast-iron with the\r\n       same acid, and obtained a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons exactly\r\n       similar to natural naphtha in taste, smell, and reaction.\r\n\r\n  [60] Probably naphtha was produced during the upheaval of all mountain\r\n       chains, but only in some cases were the conditions favourable\r\n       to its being preserved underground. The water penetrating below\r\n       formed there a mixture of naphtha and watery vapours, and this\r\n       mixture issued through fissures to the cold parts of the earth's\r\n       crust. The naphtha vapours, on condensing, formed naphtha,\r\n       which, if there were no obstacles, appeared on the surface\r\n       of land and water. Here part of it soaked through formations\r\n       (possibly the bituminous slates, schists, dolomites, &c., were\r\n       thus formed), another part was carried away on the water,\r\n       became oxidised, evaporated, and was driven to the shores (the\r\n       Caucasian naphtha probably in this way, during the existence of\r\n       the Aralo-Caspian sea, was carried as far as the Sisran banks\r\n       of the Volga, where many strata are impregnated with naphtha\r\n       and products of its oxidation resembling asphalt and pitch); a\r\n       great part of it was burnt in one way or another--that is, gave\r\n       carbonic anhydride and water. If the mixture of vapours, water,\r\n       and naphtha formed inside the earth had no free outlet to the\r\n       surface, it nevertheless would find its way through fissures to\r\n       the superior and colder strata, and there become condensed. Some\r\n       of the formations (clays) which do not absorb naphtha were only\r\n       washed away by the warm water, and formed mud, which we also now\r\n       observe issuing from the earth in the form of mud volcanoes. The\r\n       neighbourhood of Baku and the whole of the Caucasus near the\r\n       naphtha districts are full of such volcanoes, which from time to\r\n       time are in a state of eruption. In old naphtha beds (such as\r\n       the Pennsylvanian) even these blow-holes are closed, and the mud\r\n       volcanoes have had time to be washed away. The naphtha and the\r\n       gaseous hydrocarbons formed with it under the pressure of the\r\n       overlying earth and water impregnated the layers of sand, which\r\n       are capable of absorbing a great quantity of such liquid, and\r\n       if above this there were strata impermeable to naphtha (dense,\r\n       clayey, damp strata) the naphtha would accumulate in them. It is\r\n       thus preserved from remote geological periods up to the present\r\n       day, compressed and dissolved under the pressure of the gases\r\n       which burst out in places forming naphtha fountains. If this\r\n       be granted, it may be thought that in the comparatively new\r\n       (geologically speaking) mountain chains, such as the Caucasian,\r\n       naphtha is even now being formed. Such a supposition may explain\r\n       the remarkable fact that, in Pennsylvania, localities where\r\n       naphtha had been rapidly worked for five years have become\r\n       exhausted, and it becomes necessary to constantly have recourse\r\n       to sinking new wells in fresh places. Thus, from the year 1859,\r\n       the workings were gradually transferred along a line running\r\n       parallel to the Alleghany mountains for a distance of more\r\n       than 200 miles, whilst in Baku the industry dates from time\r\n       immemorial (the Persians worked near the village of Ballaghana)\r\n       and up to the present time keeps to one and the same place.\r\n       The amounts of the Pennsylvanian and Baku annual outputs are\r\n       at present equal--namely, about 250 million poods (4 million\r\n       tons). It may be that the Baku beds, as being of more recent\r\n       geological formation, are not so exhausted by nature as those of\r\n       Pennsylvania, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of Baku naphtha\r\n       is still being formed, which is partially indicated by the\r\n       continued activity of the mud volcanoes. As many varieties of\r\n       naphtha contain in solution solid slightly volatile hydrocarbons\r\n       like paraffin and mineral wax, the production of ozocerite,\r\n       or mountain wax, is accounted for in conjunction with the\r\n       formation of naphtha. Ozocerite is found in Galicia, also in\r\n       the neighbourhood of Novorossisk, in the Caucasus, and on the\r\n       islands of the Caspian Sea (particularly in the Chileken and Holy\r\n       Islands); it is met with in large masses, and is used for the\r\n       production of paraffin and _ceresene_, for the manufacture of\r\n       candles, and similar purposes.\r\n\r\n       As the naphtha treasures of the Caucasus have hardly been\r\n       exploited (near Baku and near Kouban and Grosnyi), and as naphtha\r\n       finds numerous uses, the subject presents most interesting\r\n       features to chemists and geologists, and is worthy of the close\r\n       attention of practical men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n              COMPOUNDS OF CARBON WITH OXYGEN AND NITROGEN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Dumas and Stas' apparatus for determining\r\nthe composition of carbonic anhydride. Carbon, graphite, or a diamond\r\nis placed in the tube E in the furnace, and heated in a stream of\r\noxygen displaced from the bottle by water flowing from A. The oxygen\r\nis purified from carbonic anhydride and water in the tubes B, C, D.\r\nCarbonic anhydride, together with a certain amount of carbon monoxide,\r\nis formed in E. The latter is converted into carbonic acid by passing\r\nthe products of combustion through a tube F, containing cupric oxide\r\nheated in a furnace. The cupric oxide oxidises this CO into CO_{2},\r\nforming metallic copper. The potash bulbs H and tubes I, J, K retain\r\nthe carbonic anhydride. Thus, knowing the weight of carbon taken and\r\nthe weight of the resultant carbonic anhydride (by weighing H, I, J, K\r\nbefore and after the experiment), the composition of carbonic anhydride\r\nand the equivalent of carbon may be determined.]\r\n\r\nCarbonic anhydride (or carbonic acid or carbon dioxide, CO_{2}) was\r\nthe first of all gases distinguished from atmospheric air. Paracelsus\r\nand Van Helmont, in the sixteenth century, knew that on heating\r\nlimestone a particular gas separated, which is also formed during the\r\nalcoholic fermentation of saccharine solutions (for instance, in the\r\nmanufacture of wine); they knew that it was identical with the gas\r\nwhich is produced by the combustion of charcoal, and that in some\r\ncases it is found in nature. In course of time it was found that this\r\ngas is absorbed by alkali, forming a salt which, under the action of\r\nacid, again yields this same gas. Priestley found that this gas exists\r\nin air, and Lavoisier determined its formation during respiration,\r\ncombustion, putrefaction, and during the reduction of the oxides of\r\nmetals by charcoal; he determined its composition, and showed that\r\nit only contains oxygen and carbon. Berzelius, Dumas with Stas, and\r\nRoscoe, determined its composition, showing that it contains twelve\r\nparts of carbon to thirty-two of oxygen. The composition by volume\r\nof this gas is determined from the fact that during the combustion\r\nof charcoal in oxygen, the volume remains unchanged; that is to say,\r\n_carbonic anhydride occupies the same volume as the oxygen which it\r\ncontains_--that is, the atoms of the carbon are, so to speak, squeezed\r\nin between the atoms of the oxygen. O_{2} occupies two volumes and is\r\na molecule of ordinary oxygen; CO_{2} likewise occupies two volumes,\r\nand expresses the composition and molecular weight of the gas. Carbonic\r\nanhydride exists _in nature_, both in a free state and in the most\r\nvaried compounds. In a free state it is always contained (Chapter V.) in\r\nthe air, and in solution is in all kinds of water. It is evolved from\r\nvolcanoes, from mountain fissures, and in some caves. The well-known\r\nDog grotto, near Agnano on the bay of Baiæ, near Naples, furnishes the\r\nbest known example of such an evolution. Similar sources of carbonic\r\nanhydride are also found in other places. In France, for instance, there\r\nis a well-known poisonous fountain in Auvergne. It is a round hole,\r\nsurrounded with luxurious vegetation and constantly evolving carbonic\r\nanhydride. In the woods surrounding the Lacher See near the Rhine, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of extinct volcanoes, there is a depression constantly\r\nfilled with this same gas. The insects which fly to this place perish,\r\nanimals being unable to breathe this gas. The birds chasing the insects\r\nalso die, and this is turned to profit by the local peasantry. Many\r\nmineral springs carry into the air enormous quantities of this gas.\r\nVichy in France, Sprüdel in Germany, and Narzan in Russia (in Kislovodsk\r\nnear Piatigorsk) are known for their carbonated gaseous waters. Much\r\nof this gas is also evolved in mines, cellars, diggings, and wells.\r\nPeople descending into such places are suffocated. The combustion,\r\nputrefaction, and fermentation of organic substances give rise to\r\nthe formation of carbonic anhydride. It is also introduced into the\r\natmosphere during the respiration of animals at all times and during\r\nthe respiration of plants in darkness and also during their growth.\r\nVery simple experiments prove the formation of carbonic anhydride\r\nunder these circumstances; thus, for example, if the air expelled from\r\nthe lungs be passed through a glass tube into a transparent solution\r\nof lime (or baryta) in water a white precipitate will soon be formed\r\nconsisting of an insoluble compound of lime and carbonic anhydride.\r\nBy allowing the seeds of plants to grow under a bell jar, or in a\r\nclosed vessel, the formation of carbonic anhydride may be similarly\r\nconfirmed. By confining an animal, a mouse, for instance, under a bell\r\njar, the quantity of carbonic acid which it evolves may be exactly\r\ndetermined, and it will he found to be many grams per day for a mouse.\r\nSuch experiments on the respiration of animals have been also made with\r\ngreat exactitude with large animals, such as men, bulls, sheep, &c. By\r\nmeans of enormous hermetically closed bell receivers and the analysis\r\nof the gases evolved during respiration it was found that a man expels\r\nabout 900 grams (more than two pounds) of carbonic anhydride per diem,\r\nand absorbs during this time 700 grams of oxygen.[1] It must be remarked\r\nthat the carbonic anhydride of the air constitutes the fundamental\r\nfood of plants (Chapters III., V., and VIII.) Carbonic anhydride in a\r\nstate of combination with a variety of other substances is perhaps even\r\nmore widely distributed in nature than in a free state. Some of these\r\nsubstances are very stable and form a large portion of the earth's\r\ncrust. For instance, limestones, calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}, were\r\nformed as precipitates in the seas existing previously on the earth;\r\nthis is proved by their stratified structure and the number of remains\r\nof sea animals which they frequently contain. Chalk, lithographic stone,\r\nlimestone, marls (a mixture of limestone and clay), and many other rocks\r\nare examples of such sedimentary formations. Carbonates with various\r\nother bases--such as, for instance, magnesia, ferrous oxide, zinc oxide,\r\n&c.--are often found in nature. The shells of molluscs also have the\r\ncomposition CaCO_{3} and many limestones were exclusively formed from\r\nthe shells of minute organisms. As carbonic anhydride (together with\r\nwater) is produced during the combustion of all organic compounds in\r\na stream of oxygen or by heating them with substances which readily\r\npart with their oxygen--for instance, with copper oxide--this method\r\nis employed for estimating the amount of carbon in organic compounds,\r\nmore especially as the CO_{2} can be easily collected and the amount of\r\ncarbon calculated from its weight. For this purpose a hard glass tube,\r\nclosed at one end, is filled with a mixture of the organic substance\r\n(about 0·2 gram) and copper oxide. The open end of the tube is fitted\r\nwith a cork and tube containing calcium chloride for absorbing the water\r\nformed by the oxidation of the substance. This tube is hermetically\r\nconnected (by a caoutchouc tube) with potash bulbs or other weighing\r\napparatus (Chapter V.) containing alkali destined to absorb the carbonic\r\nanhydride. The increase in weight of this apparatus shows the amounts of\r\ncarbonic anhydride formed during the combustion of the given substance,\r\nand the quantity of carbon may be determined from this, because three\r\nparts of carbon give eleven parts of carbonic anhydride.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.--62. Apparatus for the combustion of organic\r\nsubstances by igniting them with oxide of copper.]\r\n\r\n  [1] The quantity of carbonic acid gas exhaled by a man during the\r\n      twenty-four hours is not evenly produced; during the night more\r\n      oxygen is taken in than during the day (by night, in twelve hours,\r\n      about 450 grams), and more carbonic anhydride is separated by day\r\n      than during night-time and repose; thus, of the 900 grams produced\r\n      during the twenty-four hours about 375 are given out during the\r\n      night and 525 by day. This depends on the formation of carbonic\r\n      anhydride during the work performed by the man in the day. Every\r\n      movement is the result of some change of matter, for force cannot\r\n      be self-created (in accordance with the law of the conservation of\r\n      energy). Proportionally to the amount of carbon consumed an amount\r\n      of energy is stored up in the organism and is consumed in the\r\n      various movements performed by animals. This is proved by the fact\r\n      that during work a man exhales 525 grams of carbonic anhydride in\r\n      twelve hours instead of 375, absorbing the same amount of oxygen\r\n      as before. After a working day a man exhales by night almost the\r\n      same amount of carbonic anhydride as after a day of rest, so that\r\n      during a total twenty-four hours a man exhales about 900 grams\r\n      of carbonic anhydride and absorbs about 980 grams of oxygen.\r\n      Therefore during work the change of matter increases. The carbon\r\n      expended on the work is obtained from the food; on this account\r\n      the food of animals ought certainly to contain carbonaceous\r\n      substances capable of dissolving under the action of the digestive\r\n      fluids, and of passing into the blood, or, in other words, capable\r\n      of being digested. Such food for man and all other animals is\r\n      formed of vegetable matter, or of parts of other animals. The\r\n      latter in every case obtain their carbonaceous matter from plants,\r\n      in which it is formed by the separation of the carbon from the\r\n      carbonic anhydride taken up during the day by the respiration of\r\n      the plants. The volume of the oxygen exhaled by plants is almost\r\n      equal to the volume of the carbonic anhydride absorbed; that is to\r\n      say, nearly all the oxygen entering into the plant in the form of\r\n      carbonic anhydride is liberated in a free state, whilst the carbon\r\n      from the carbonic anhydride remains in the plant. At the same time\r\n      the plant absorbs moisture by its leaves and roots. By a process\r\n      which is unknown to us, this absorbed moisture and the carbon\r\n      obtained from the carbonic anhydride enter into the composition of\r\n      the plants in the form of so-called carbohydrates, composing the\r\n      greater part of the vegetable tissues, starch and cellulose of the\r\n      composition C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} being representatives of them. They\r\n      may be considered like all carbohydrates as compounds of carbon\r\n      and water, 6C + 5H_{2}O. In this way a _circulation_ of the carbon\r\n      goes on in nature by means of vegetable and animal organisms, in\r\n      which changes the principal factor is the carbonic anhydride of\r\n      the air.\r\n\r\n_For the preparation of carbonic anhydride_ in laboratories and often\r\nin manufactories, various kinds of calcium carbonate are used, being\r\ntreated with some acid; it is, however, most usual to employ the\r\nso-called muriatic acid--that is, an aqueous solution of hydrochloric\r\nacid, HCl--because, in the first place, the substance formed, calcium\r\nchloride. CaCl_{2}, is soluble in water and does not hinder the further\r\naction of the acid on the calcium carbonate, and secondly because, as\r\nwe shall see further on, muriatic acid is a common product of chemical\r\nworks and one of the cheapest. For calcium carbonate, either limestone,\r\nchalk, or marble is used.[2]\r\n\r\n              CaCO_{3} + 2HCl = CaCl_{2} + H_{2}O + CO_{2}.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the reaction in this case is the same as in the\r\ndecomposition of nitre by sulphuric acid; only in the latter case a\r\nhydrate is formed, and in the former an anhydride of the acid, because\r\nthe hydrate, carbonic acid, H_{2}CO_{3}, is unstable and as soon as it\r\nseparates decomposes into water and its own anhydride. It is evident\r\nfrom the explanation of the cause of the action of sulphuric acid\r\non nitre that not every acid can be employed for obtaining carbonic\r\nanhydride; namely, those will not set it free which chemically are\r\nbut slightly energetic, or those which are insoluble in water, or are\r\nthemselves as volatile as carbonic anhydride.[3] But as many acids are\r\nsoluble in water and are less volatile than carbonic anhydride, the\r\nlatter is evolved by the action of most acids on its salts, and this\r\nreaction takes place at ordinary temperatures.[4]\r\n\r\n  [2] Other acids may be used instead of hydrochloric; for instance,\r\n      acetic, or even sulphuric, although this latter is not suitable,\r\n      because it forms as a product insoluble calcium sulphate (gypsum)\r\n      which surrounds the untouched calcium carbonate, and thus prevents\r\n      a further evolution of gas. But if porous limestone--for instance,\r\n      chalk--be treated with sulphuric acid diluted with an equal volume\r\n      of water, the liquid is absorbed and acting on the mass of the\r\n      salt, the evolution of carbonic anhydride continues evenly for a\r\n      long time. Instead of calcium carbonate other carbonates may of\r\n      course be used; for instance, washing-soda, Na_{2}CO_{3}, which\r\n      is often chosen when it is required to produce a rapid stream of\r\n      carbonic anhydride (for example, for liquefying it). But natural\r\n      crystalline magnesium carbonate and similar salts are with\r\n      difficulty decomposed by hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. When\r\n      for manufacturing purposes--for instance, in precipitating lime in\r\n      sugar-works--a large quantity of carbonic acid gas is required,\r\n      it is generally obtained by burning charcoal, and the products of\r\n      combustion, rich in carbonic anhydride, are pumped into the liquid\r\n      containing the lime, and the carbonic anhydride is thus absorbed.\r\n      Another method is also practised, which consists in using the\r\n      carbonic anhydride separated during fermentation, or that\r\n      evolved from limekilns. During the fermentation of sweet-wort,\r\n      grape-juice, and other similar saccharine solutions, the glucose\r\n      C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} changes under the influence of the yeast\r\n      organism, forming alcohol (2C_{2}H_{6}O), and carbonic anhydride\r\n      (2CO_{2}) which separates in the form of gas; if the fermentation\r\n      proceeds in closed bottles sparkling wine is obtained. When\r\n      carbonic acid gas is prepared for saturating water and other\r\n      beverages it is necessary to use it in a pure state. Whilst in\r\n      the state in which it is evolved from ordinary limestones by the\r\n      aid of acids it contains, besides a certain quantity of acid,\r\n      the organic matters of the limestone; in order to diminish the\r\n      quantity of these substances the densest kinds of dolomites are\r\n      used, which contain less organic matter, and the gas formed is\r\n      passed through various washing apparatus, and then through a\r\n      solution of potassium permanganate, which absorbs organic matter\r\n      and does not take up carbonic anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [3] Hypochlorous acid, HClO, and its anhydride, Cl_{2}O, do not displace\r\n      carbonic acid, and hydrogen sulphide has the same relation to\r\n      carbonic acid as nitric acid to hydrochloric--an excess of either\r\n      one displaces the other.\r\n\r\n  [4] Thus, in preparing the ordinary effervescing powders, sodium\r\n      bicarbonate (or acid carbonate of soda) is used, and mixed\r\n      with powdered citric or tartaric acid. In a dry state these\r\n      powders do not evolve carbonic anhydride, but when mixed with\r\n      water the evolution takes place briskly, which is due to the\r\n      substances passing into solution. The salts of carbonic acid\r\n      may be recognised from the fact that they evolve carbonic acid\r\n      with a hissing noise when treated with acids. If vinegar, which\r\n      contains acetic acid, be poured upon limestone, marble, malachite\r\n      (containing copper carbonate), &c., carbonic anhydride is evolved\r\n      with a hissing noise. It is noteworthy that neither hydrochloric\r\n      acid, nor even sulphuric acid nor acetic acid, acts on limestone\r\n      except in presence of water. We shall refer to this later on.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of carbonic anhydride in laboratories, marble is\r\ngenerally used. It is placed in a Woulfe's bottle and treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid in an apparatus similar to the one used for the\r\nproduction of hydrogen. The gas evolved carries away through the tube\r\npart of the volatile hydrochloric acid, and it is therefore necessary to\r\nwash the gas by passing it through another Woulfe's bottle containing\r\nwater. If it be necessary to obtain dry carbonic anhydride, it must be\r\npassed through chloride of calcium.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] The direct observations made (1876) by Messrs. Bogouski and\r\n      Kayander lead to the conclusion that the quantity of carbonic\r\n      anhydride evolved by the action of acids on marble (as homogeneous\r\n      as possible) is directly proportional to the time of action, the\r\n      extent of surface, and the degree of concentration of the acid,\r\n      and inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the acid.\r\n      If the surface of a piece of Carrara marble be equal to one\r\n      decimetre, the time of action one minute, and one cubic decimetre\r\n      or litre contains one gram of hydrochloric acid, then about 0·02\r\n      gram of carbonic anhydride will be evolved. If the litre contains\r\n      _n_ grams of hydrochloric acid, then by experiment the amount\r\n      will be _n_ × 0·02 of carbonic anhydride. Therefore, if the\r\n      litre contains 36·5 (= HCl) grams, about 0·73 gram of carbonic\r\n      anhydride (about half a litre) would he evolved per minute. If\r\n      nitric acid or hydrobromic acid be used instead of hydrochloric,\r\n      then, with a combining proportion of the acid, the same quantity\r\n      of carbonic anhydride will be evolved; thus, if the litre contains\r\n      63 (= HNO_{3}) grams of nitric acid, or 81 (= HBr) grams of\r\n      hydrobromic acid, the quantity of carbonic anhydride evolved will\r\n      still be 0·73 gram. Spring, in 1890, made a series of similar\r\n      determinations.\r\n\r\nCarbonic anhydride may also be prepared by heating many of the salts of\r\ncarbonic acid; for instance, by heating magnesium carbonate, MgCO_{3}\r\n(_e.g._, in the form of dolomite), the separation is easily effected,\r\nparticularly in the presence of the vapours of water. The acid salts\r\nof carbonic acid (for instance, NaHCO_{3}, see further on) readily and\r\nabundantly give carbonic anhydride when heated.\r\n\r\nCarbonic anhydride is colourless, has a slight smell and a faint acid\r\ntaste; its density in a gaseous state is twenty-two times as great\r\nas that of hydrogen, because its molecular weight is forty-four.[6]\r\nIt is an example of those gaseous substances which have been long\r\nago transformed into all the three states. In order to obtain liquid\r\ncarbonic anhydride, the gas must be submitted to a pressure of\r\nthirty-six atmospheres at 0°.[7] Its absolute boiling point = +32°.[8]\r\nLiquid carbonic anhydride is colourless, does not mix with water, but\r\nis soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils; at 0° its specific gravity is\r\n0·83.[8 bis] The boiling point of this liquid lies at -80°--that is to\r\nsay, the pressure of carbonic acid gas at that temperature does not\r\nexceed that of the atmosphere. At the ordinary temperature the liquid\r\nremains as such for some time under ordinary pressure, on account of\r\nits requiring a considerable amount of heat for its evaporation. If\r\nthe evaporation takes place rapidly, especially if the liquid issues\r\nin a stream, such a decrease of temperature occurs that a part of the\r\ncarbonic anhydride is transformed into a solid snowy mass. Water,\r\nmercury, and many other liquids freeze on coming into contact with\r\nsnow-like carbonic anhydride.[9] In this form carbonic anhydride may be\r\npreserved for a long time in the open air, because it requires still\r\nmore heat to turn it into a gas than when in a liquid state.[9 bis]\r\n\r\n  [6] As carbonic anhydride is one and a half times heavier than air, it\r\n      diffuses with difficulty, and therefore does not easily mix with\r\n      air, but sinks in it. This may be shown in various ways; for\r\n      instance, the gas may be carefully poured from one vessel into\r\n      another containing air. If a lighted taper be plunged into the\r\n      vessel containing carbonic anhydride it is extinguished, and then,\r\n      after pouring the gas into the other cylinder, it will burn in the\r\n      former and be extinguished in the latter. If a certain quantity\r\n      of carbonic anhydride be poured into a vessel containing air, and\r\n      soap-bubbles be introduced, they will only sink as far as the\r\n      stratum where the atmosphere of carbonic anhydride commences, as\r\n      this latter is heavier than the soap-bubbles filled with air.\r\n      Naturally, after a certain lapse of time, the carbonic anhydride\r\n      will be diffused throughout the vessel, and form a uniform mixture\r\n      with the air, just as salt in water.\r\n\r\n  [7] This liquefaction was first observed by Faraday, who sealed up in\r\n      a tube a mixture of a carbonate and sulphuric acid. Afterwards\r\n      this method was very considerably improved by Thilorier and\r\n      Natterer, whose apparatus is given in Chapter VI. in describing\r\n      N_{2}O. It is, however, necessary to remark that the preparation\r\n      of liquid carbonic anhydride requires good liquefying apparatus,\r\n      constant cooling, and a rapid preparation of large masses of\r\n      carbonic anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [8] Carbonic anhydride, having the same molecular weight as nitrous\r\n      oxide, very much resembles it when in a liquid state.\r\n\r\n  [8 bis] When poured into a tube, which is then sealed up, liquefied\r\n      carbonic anhydride can be easily preserved, because a thick tube\r\n      easily supports the pressure (about 50 atmospheres) exerted by the\r\n      liquid at the ordinary temperature.\r\n\r\n  [9] When a fine stream of liquid carbonic anhydride is discharged into\r\n      a closed metallic vessel, about one-third of its mass solidifies\r\n      and the remainder evaporates. In employing solid carbonic\r\n      anhydride for making experiments at low temperatures, it is best\r\n      to use it mixed with ether, otherwise there will be few points\r\n      of contact. If a stream of air be blown through a mixture of\r\n      liquid carbonic anhydride and ether, the evaporation proceeds\r\n      rapidly, and great cold is obtained. At present in some special\r\n      manufactories (and for making artificial mineral waters)\r\n      carbonic anhydride is liquefied on the large scale, filled into\r\n      wrought-iron cylinders provided with a valve, and in this manner\r\n      it can be transported and preserved safely for a long time. It is\r\n      used, for instance, in breweries.\r\n\r\n  [9 bis] Solid carbonic anhydride, notwithstanding its very low\r\n      temperature, can be safely placed on the hand, because it\r\n      continually evolves gas which prevents its coming into actual\r\n      contact with the skin, but if a piece be squeezed between the\r\n      fingers, it produces a severe frost bite similar to a burn. If the\r\n      snow-like solid be mixed with ether, a semi-liquid mass is\r\n      obtained, which is employed for artificial refrigeration. This\r\n      mixture may be used for liquefying many other gases--such as\r\n      chlorine, nitrous oxide, hydrogen sulphide, and others. The\r\n      evaporation of such a mixture proceeds with far greater rapidity\r\n      under the receiver of an air-pump, and consequently the\r\n      refrigeration is more intense. By this means many gases may be\r\n      liquefied which resist other methods--namely, olefiant gas,\r\n      hydrochloric acid gas, and others. Liquid carbonic anhydride in\r\n      this case congeals in the tube into a glassy transparent mass.\r\n      Pictet availed himself of this method for liquefying many permanent\r\n      gases (_see_ Chapter II.)\r\n\r\n      Bleekrode, by compressing solid CO_{2} in a cylinder by means of a\r\n      piston, obtained a semi-transparent stick, which contained as much\r\n      as 1·3 and even 1·6 gram of CO_{2} per cubic centimetre. In this\r\n      form the CO_{2} slowly evaporated, and could be kept for a long\r\n      time.\r\n\r\nThe capacity which carbonic anhydride has of being liquefied stands in\r\nconnection with its _considerable solubility in water_, alcohol, and\r\nother liquids. Its solubility in water has been already spoken of in the\r\nfirst chapter. Carbonic anhydride is still more soluble in alcohol than\r\nin water, namely at 0° one volume of alcohol dissolves 4·3 volumes of\r\nthis gas, and at 20° 2·9 volumes.\r\n\r\nAqueous solutions of carbonic anhydride, under a pressure of several\r\natmospheres, are now prepared artificially, because water saturated\r\nwith this gas promotes digestion and quenches thirst. For this purpose\r\nthe carbonic anhydride is pumped by means of a force-pump into a closed\r\nvessel containing the liquid, and then bottled off, taking special means\r\nto ensure rapid and air-tight corking. Various effervescing drinks and\r\nartificially effervescing wines are thus prepared. The presence of\r\ncarbonic anhydride has an important significance in nature, because by\r\nits means water acquires the property of decomposing and dissolving many\r\nsubstances which are not acted on by pure water; for instance, calcium\r\nphosphates and carbonates are soluble in water containing carbonic acid.\r\nIf the water in the interior of the earth is saturated with carbonic\r\nacid under pressure, the quantity of calcium carbonate in solution may\r\nreach three grams per litre, and on issuing at the surface, as the\r\ncarbonic anhydride escapes, the calcium carbonate will be deposited.[10]\r\nWater charged with carbonic anhydride brings about the destruction of\r\nmany rocky formations by removing the lime, alkali, &c., from them. This\r\nprocess has been going on and continues on an enormous scale. Rocks\r\ncontain silica and the oxides of various metals; amongst others, the\r\noxides of aluminium, calcium, and sodium. Water charged with carbonic\r\nacid dissolves both the latter, transforming them into carbonates. The\r\nwaters of the ocean ought, as the evolution of the carbonic anhydride\r\nproceeds, to precipitate salts of lime; these are actually found\r\neverywhere on the surface of the ground in those places which previously\r\nformed the bed of the ocean. The presence of carbonic anhydride in\r\nsolution in water is essential to the nourishment and growth of water\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n  [10] If such water trickles through crevices and enters a cavern, the\r\n       evaporation will be slow, and therefore in those places from\r\n       which the water drips growths of calcium carbonate will be\r\n       formed, just like the icicles formed on the roof-gutters in\r\n       winter-time. Similar conical and cylindrical stony growths form\r\n       the so-called stalactites or pendants hanging from above and\r\n       stalagmites formed on the bottom of caves. Sometimes these two\r\n       kinds meet together, forming entire columns filling the cave.\r\n       Many of these caves are remarkable for their picturesqueness; for\r\n       instance, the cave of Antiparos, in the Grecian Archipelago. This\r\n       same cause also forms spongy masses of calcium carbonate in those\r\n       places where the springs come to the surface of the earth. It is\r\n       therefore very evident that a calcareous solution is sometimes\r\n       capable of penetrating plants and filling the whole of their mass\r\n       with calcium carbonate. This is one of the forms of petrified\r\n       plants. Calcium phosphate in solution in water containing\r\n       carbonic acid plays an important part in the nourishment of\r\n       plants, because all plants contain both lime and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nAlthough carbonic anhydride is soluble in water, yet no definite hydrate\r\nis formed;[11] nevertheless an idea of the composition of this hydrate\r\nmay be formed from that of the salts of carbonic acid, because a hydrate\r\nis nothing but a salt in which the metal is replaced by hydrogen.\r\nAs carbonic anhydride forms salts of the composition K_{2}CO_{3},\r\nNa_{2}CO_{3}, HNaCO_{3}, &c., therefore carbonic acid ought to have\r\nthe composition H_{2}CO_{3}--that is, it ought to contain CO_{2} +\r\nH_{2}O. Whenever this substance is formed, it decomposes into its\r\ncomponent parts--that is, into water and carbonic anhydride. _The acid\r\nproperties_ of carbonic anhydride[11 bis] are demonstrated by its being\r\ndirectly absorbed by alkaline solutions and forming salts with them. In\r\ndistinction from nitric, HNO_{3}, and similar monobasic acids which with\r\nunivalent metals (exchanging one atom for one atom of hydrogen) give\r\nsalts such as those of potassium, sodium, and silver containing only one\r\natom of the metal (NaNO_{3}, AgNO_{3}), and with bivalent[12] metals\r\n(such as calcium, barium, lead) salts containing two acid groups--for\r\nexample, Ca(NO_{3})_{2}, Pb(NO_{3})_{2}--carbonic acid, H_{2}CO_{3},\r\n_is bibasic_, that is contains two atoms of hydrogen in the hydrate or\r\ntwo atoms of univalent metals in their salts: for example, Na_{2}CO_{3}\r\nis washing soda, a normal salt; NaHCO_{3} is the bicarbonate, an\r\nacid salt. Therefore, if M´ be a univalent metal, its carbonates in\r\ngeneral are the normal carbonate M´_{2}CO_{3} and the acid carbonate,\r\nM´HCO_{3}; or if M´´ be a bivalent metal (replacing H_{2}) its normal\r\ncarbonate will be M´´CO_{3}; these metals do not usually form acid\r\nsalts, as we shall see further on. The bibasic character of carbonic\r\nacid is akin to that of sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4},[13] but the\r\nlatter, in distinction from the former, is an example of the energetic\r\nor strong acids (such as nitric or hydrochloric), whilst in carbonic\r\nacid we observe but feeble development of the acid properties; hence\r\ncarbonic acid must be considered _a weak acid_. This conception must,\r\nhowever, be taken as only comparative, as up to this time there is no\r\ndefinitely established rule for measuring the energy[14] of acids. The\r\nfeeble acid properties of carbonic acid may, however, be judged from\r\nthe joint evidence of many properties. With such energetic alkalis\r\nas soda and potash, carbonic acid forms normal salts, soluble in\r\nwater, but having an alkaline reaction and in many cases themselves\r\nacting as alkalis.[15] The acid salts of these alkalis, NaHCO_{3} and\r\nKHCO_{3}, have a neutral reaction on litmus, although they, like acids,\r\ncontain hydrogen, which may be exchanged for metals. The acid salts\r\nof such acids--as, for instance, of sulphuric acid, NaHSO_{4}--have a\r\nclearly defined acid reaction, and therefore carbonic acid is unable\r\nto neutralise the powerful basic properties of such alkalis as potash\r\nor soda. Carbonic acid does not even combine at all with feeble bases,\r\nsuch as alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}, and therefore if a strong solution of\r\nsodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, be added to a strong solution of\r\naluminium sulphate, Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}, although according to double\r\nsaline decompositions aluminium carbonate, Al_{2}(CO_{3})_{3}, ought\r\nto be formed, the carbonic acid separates, for this salt splits up in\r\nthe presence of water into aluminium hydroxide and carbonic anhydride:\r\nAl_{2}(CO_{3})_{3} + 3H_{2}O = Al_{2}(OH)_{6} + 3CO_{2}. Thus feeble\r\nbases are unable to retain carbonic acid even at ordinary temperatures.\r\nFor the same reason, in the case of bases of medium energy, although\r\nthey form carbonates, the latter are comparatively easily decomposed by\r\nheating, as is shown by the decomposition of copper carbonate, CuCO_{3}\r\n(_see_ Introduction), and even of calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}. Only\r\nthe normal (not the acid) salts of such powerful bases as potassium\r\nand sodium are capable of standing a red heat without decomposition.\r\nThe acid salts--for instance, NaHCO_{3}--decompose even on heating\r\ntheir solutions (2NaHCO_{3} = Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2}), evolving\r\ncarbonic anhydride. The amount of heat given out by the combination of\r\ncarbonic acid with bases also shows its feeble acid properties, being\r\nconsiderably less than with energetic acids. Thus if a weak solution\r\nof forty grams of sodium hydroxide be saturated (up to the formation\r\nof a normal salt) with sulphuric or nitric acid or another powerful\r\nacid, from thirteen to fifteen thousand calories are given out, but\r\nwith carbonic acid only about ten thousand calories.[16] The majority\r\nof carbonates are insoluble in water, and therefore such solutions as\r\nsodium, potassium, or ammonium carbonates form in solutions of most\r\nother salts, MX or M´´X_{2}, insoluble precipitates of carbonates,\r\nM_{2}CO_{3} or M´´CO_{3}. Thus a solution of barium chloride gives with\r\nsodium carbonate a precipitate of barium carbonate, BaCO_{3}. For this\r\nreason rocks, especially those of aqueous origin, very often contain\r\ncarbonates; for example, calcium, ferrous, or magnesium carbonates, &c.\r\n\r\n  [11] The crystallohydrate, CO_{2},8H_{2}O of Wroblewski (Chapter 1.,\r\n       Note 67), in the first place, is only formed under special\r\n       conditions; in the second place, its existence still requires\r\n       confirmation; and in the third place, it does not correspond with\r\n       that hydrate H_{2}CO_{3} which should occur, judging from the\r\n       composition of the salts.\r\n\r\n  [11 bis] It is easy to demonstrate the acid properties of carbonic\r\n       anhydride by taking a long tube, closed at one end, and filling\r\n       it with this gas; a test-tube is then filled with a solution of\r\n       an alkali (for instance, sodium hydroxide), which is then poured\r\n       into the long tube and the open end is corked. The solution is\r\n       then well shaken in the tube, and the corked end plunged into\r\n       water. If the cork be now withdrawn under water, the water will\r\n       fill the tube. The vacuum obtained by the absorption of the\r\n       carbonic anhydride by an alkali is so complete that even an\r\n       electric discharge will not pass through it. This method is often\r\n       applied to produce a vacuum.\r\n\r\n  [12] The reasons for distinguishing the uni-, bi-, tri-, and\r\n       quadrivalent metals will be explained hereafter on passing from\r\n       the univalent metals (Na, K, Li) to the bivalent (Mg. Ca, Ba),\r\n       Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n  [13] Up to the year 1840, or thereabout, acids were not distinguished\r\n       by their basicity. Graham, while studying phosphoric acid,\r\n       H_{3}PO_{4}, and Liebig, while studying many organic acids,\r\n       distinguished mono-, bi-, and tribasic acids. Gerhardt and Laurent\r\n       generalised these relations, showing that this distinction extends\r\n       over many reactions (for instance, to the faculty of bibasic acids\r\n       of forming acid salts with alkalis, KHO or NaHO, or with alcohols,\r\n       RHO, &c.); but now, since a definite conception as to atoms and\r\n       molecules has been arrived at, _the basicity of an acid is\r\n       determined by the number of hydrogen atoms,_ contained in a\r\n       molecule of the acid, which can be exchanged for metals. If\r\n       carbonic acid forms acid salts, NaHCO_{3}, and normal salts,\r\n       Na_{2}CO_{3}, it is evident that the hydrate is H_{2}CO_{3}, a\r\n       bibasic acid. Otherwise it is at present impossible to account for\r\n       the composition of these salts. But when C = 6 and O = 8 were\r\n       taken, then the formula CO_{2} expressed the composition, but not\r\n       the molecular weight, of carbonic anhydride; and the composition\r\n       of the normal salt would be Na_{2}C_{2}O_{6} or NaCO_{3},\r\n       therefore carbonic acid might have been considered as a monobasic\r\n       acid. Then the acid salt would have been represented by\r\n       NaCO_{3},HCO_{3}. Such questions were the cause of much argument\r\n       and difference of opinion among chemists about forty years ago. At\r\n       present there cannot be two opinions on the subject if the law of\r\n       Avogadro-Gerhardt and its consequences be strictly adhered to. It\r\n       may, however, be observed here that the monobasic acids R(OH) were\r\n       for a long time considered to be incapable of being decomposed\r\n       into water and anhydride, and this property was ascribed to the\r\n       bibasic acids R(OH)_{2} as containing the elements necessary for\r\n       the separation of the molecule of water, H_{2}O. Thus H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n       or SO_{2}(OH)_{2}, H_{2}CO_{3}, or CO(OH)_{2}, and other bibasic\r\n       acids decompose into an anhydride, RO, and water, H_{2}O. But as\r\n       nitrous, HNO_{2}, iodic, HIO_{3}, hypochlorous, HClO, and other\r\n       monobasic acids easily give their anhydrides N_{2}O_{3},\r\n       I_{2}O_{5}, Cl_{2}O, &c., that method of distinguishing the\r\n       basicity of acids, although it fairly well satisfies the\r\n       requirements of organic chemistry, cannot be considered correct.\r\n       It may also be remarked that up to the present time not one of the\r\n       bibasic acids has been found to have the faculty of being\r\n       distilled without being decomposed into anhydride and water (even\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4}, on being evaporated and distilled, gives SO_{3} +\r\n       H_{2}O), and the decomposition of acids into water and anhydride\r\n       proceeds particularly easily in dealing with feebly energetic\r\n       acids, such as carbonic, nitrous, boric, and hypochlorous. Let us\r\n       add that carbonic acid, as a hydrate corresponding to marsh gas,\r\n       C(HO)_{4} = CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O, ought to be tetrabasic. But in\r\n       general it does not form such salts. Basic salts, however, such as\r\n       CuCO_{3}CuO, may be regarded in this sense, for CCu_{2}O_{4}\r\n       corresponds with CH_{4}O_{4}, as Cu corresponds with H_{2}.\r\n       Amongst the ethereal salts (alcoholic derivatives) of carbonic\r\n       acid corresponding cases are, however, observed; for instance,\r\n       ethylic orthocarbonate, C(C_{2}H_{5}O)_{4} (obtained by the action\r\n       of chloropicrin, C(NO_{2})Cl_{3}, on sodium ethoxide,\r\n       C_{2}H_{5}ONa; boiling point 158°; specific gravity, 0·92). The\r\n       name _orthocarbonic acid_ for CH_{4}O_{4} is taken from\r\n       _orthophosphoric acid_, PH_{3}O_{4}, which corresponds with PH_{3}\r\n       (_see_ Chapter on Phosphorus).\r\n\r\n  [14] Long ago endeavours were made to find a _measure of affinity_ of\r\n       acids and bases, because some of the acids, such as sulphuric or\r\n       nitric, form comparatively stable salts, decomposed with\r\n       difficulty by heat and water, whilst others, like carbonic and\r\n       hypochlorous acids, do not combine with feeble bases, and with\r\n       most of the other bases form salts which are easily decomposed.\r\n       The same may be said with regard to bases, among which those of\r\n       potassium, K_{2}O, sodium, Na_{2}O, and barium, BaO, may serve as\r\n       examples of the most powerful, because they combine with the most\r\n       feeble acids and form a mass of salts of great stability, whilst\r\n       as examples of the feeblest bases alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}, or bismuth\r\n       oxide, Bi_{2}O_{3}, may be taken, because they form salts easily\r\n       decomposed by water and by heat if the acid be volatile. Such a\r\n       division of acids and bases into the feeblest and most powerful is\r\n       justified by all evidence concerning them, and is quoted in this\r\n       work. But the teaching of this subject in certain circles has\r\n       acquired quite a new tone, which, in my opinion, cannot be\r\n       accepted without certain reservations and criticisms, although it\r\n       comprises many interesting features. The fact is that Thomsen,\r\n       Ostwald, and others proposed to express the measure of affinity of\r\n       acids to bases by figures drawn from data of the measure of\r\n       displacement of acids in aqueous solutions, judging (1) from the\r\n       amount of heat developed by mixing a solution of the salt with a\r\n       solution of another acid (the avidity of acids, according to\r\n       Thomsen); (2) from the change of the volumes accompanying such a\r\n       mutual action of solutions (Ostwald); (3) from the change of the\r\n       index of refraction of solutions (Ostwald), &c. Besides this there\r\n       are many other methods which allow us to form an opinion about the\r\n       distribution of bases among various acids in aqueous solutions.\r\n       Some of these methods will be described hereafter. It ought,\r\n       however, to be remarked that in making investigations in aqueous\r\n       solutions the affinity to water is generally left out of sight. If\r\n       a base N, combining with acids X and Y in presence of them both,\r\n       divides in such a way that one-third of it combines with X and\r\n       two-thirds with Y, a conclusion is formed that the affinity, or\r\n       power of forming salts, of the acid Y is twice as great as that of\r\n       X. But the presence of the water is not taken into account. If the\r\n       acid X has an affinity for water and for N it will be distributed\r\n       between them; and if X has a greater affinity for water than Y,\r\n       then less of X will combine with N than of Y. If, in addition to\r\n       this, the acid X is capable of forming an acid salt NX_{2}, and Y\r\n       is not, the conclusion of the relative strength of X and Y will be\r\n       still more erroneous, because the X set free will form such a salt\r\n       on the addition of Y to NX. We shall see in Chapter X. that when\r\n       sulphuric and nitric acids in weak aqueous solution act on sodium,\r\n       they are distributed exactly in this way: namely, one-third of the\r\n       sodium combines with the sulphuric and two-thirds with the nitric\r\n       acid; but, in my opinion, this does not show that sulphuric acid,\r\n       compared with nitric acid, possesses but half the degree of\r\n       affinity for bases like soda, and only demonstrates the greater\r\n       affinity of sulphuric acid for water compared with that of nitric\r\n       acid. In this way the methods of studying the distribution in\r\n       aqueous solutions probably only shows the difference of the\r\n       relation of the acid to a base and to water.\r\n\r\n       In view of these considerations, although the teaching of the\r\n       distribution of salt-forming elements in _aqueous solutions_ is an\r\n       object of great and independent interest, it can hardly serve to\r\n       determine the measure of affinity between bases and acids. Similar\r\n       considerations ought to be kept in view when determining the\r\n       energy of acids by means of the _electrical conductivity of their\r\n       weak solutions_. This method, proposed by Arrhenius (1884), and\r\n       applied on an extensive scale by Ostwald (who developed it in\r\n       great detail in his _Lehrbuch d. allgemeinen Chemie_, v. ii.,\r\n       1887), is founded on the fact that the relation of the so-called\r\n       molecular electrical-conductivity of weak solutions of various\r\n       acids (I) coincides with the relation in which the same acids\r\n       stand according to the distribution, (II) found by one of the\r\n       above-mentioned methods, and with the relation deduced for them\r\n       from observations upon the velocity of reaction, (III) for\r\n       instance, according to the rate of the splitting up of an ethereal\r\n       salt (into alcohol and acid), or from the rate of the so-called\r\n       inversion of sugar--that is, its transformation into glucose--as\r\n       is seen by comparing the annexed figures, in which the energy of\r\n       hydrochloric acid is taken as equal to 100:--\r\n\r\n                                              I    II  III\r\n\r\n              Hydrochloric acid, HCl         100  100  100\r\n              Hydrobromic acid, HBr          101   98  105\r\n              Nitric acid, HNO_{3}           100  100   96\r\n              Sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}     65   49   74\r\n              Formic acid, CH_{2}O_{2}         2    4    1\r\n              Acetic acid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}     1    2    1\r\n              Oxalic acid, C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}    20   24   18\r\n              Phosphoric acid, PH_{3}O_{4}     7   --    6\r\n\r\n       The coincidence of these figures, obtained by so many various\r\n       methods, presents a most important and instructive relation\r\n       between phenomena of different kinds, but in my opinion it does\r\n       not permit us to assert that the degree of affinity existing\r\n       between bases and various acids is determined by all these various\r\n       methods, because the influence of the water must be taken into\r\n       consideration. On this account, until the theory of solution is\r\n       more thoroughly worked out, this subject (which for the present\r\n       ought to be treated of in special treatises on chemical mechanics)\r\n       must be treated with great caution. But now we may hope to decide\r\n       this question guided by a study of the rate of reaction, the\r\n       influence of acids and bases upon indicators, &c., all of which\r\n       are treated fully in works on physical and theoretical chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [15] Thus, for instance, in the washing of fabrics the caustic alkalis,\r\n       such as sodium hydroxide, in weak solutions, act in removing the\r\n       fatty matter just in the same way as carbonate solutions; for\r\n       instance, a solution of soda crystals, Na_{2}CO_{3}. Soap acts in\r\n       the same way, being composed of feeble acids, either fatty or\r\n       resinous, combined with alkali. On this account all such\r\n       substances are applied in manufacturing processes, and answer\r\n       equally well in practice for bleaching and washing fabrics. Soda\r\n       crystals or soap are preferred to caustic alkali, because an\r\n       excess of the latter may have a destructive effect on the fabrics.\r\n       It may be supposed that in aqueous solutions of soap or soda\r\n       crystals, part of the base will form caustic alkali; that is to\r\n       say, the water will compete with the weak acids, and the alkali\r\n       will be distributed between them and the water.\r\n\r\n  [16] Although carbonic acid is reckoned among the feeble acids, yet\r\n       there are evidently many others still feebler--for instance,\r\n       prussic acid, hypochlorous acid, many organic acids, &c. Bases\r\n       like alumina, or such feeble acids as silica, when in combination\r\n       with alkalis, are decomposed in aqueous solutions by carbonic\r\n       acid, but on fusion--that is, without the presence of water--they\r\n       displace it, which clearly shows in phenomena of this kind how\r\n       much depends upon the conditions of reaction and the properties of\r\n       the substances formed. These relations, which at first sight\r\n       appear complex, may be best understood if we represent that two\r\n       salts, MX and NY, in general always give more or less of two other\r\n       salts, MY and NX, and then examine the properties of the derived\r\n       substances. Thus, in solution, sodium silicate, Na_{2}SiO_{3},\r\n       with carbonic anhydride will to some extent form sodium carbonate\r\n       and silica, SiO_{2}; but the latter, being colloid, separates, and\r\n       the remaining mass of sodium silicate is again decomposed by\r\n       carbonic anhydride, so that finally silica separates and sodium\r\n       carbonate is formed. In a fused state the case is different;\r\n       sodium carbonate will react with silica to form carbonic anhydride\r\n       and sodium silicate, but the carbonic anhydride will be separated\r\n       as a gas, and therefore in the residue the same reaction will\r\n       again take place, and ultimately the carbonic anhydride is\r\n       entirely eliminated and sodium silicate remains. If, on the other\r\n       hand, nothing is removed from the sphere of the reaction,\r\n       distribution takes place. Therefore, although carbonic anhydride\r\n       is a feeble acid, still not for this reason, but only in virtue of\r\n       its gaseous form, do all soluble acids displace it in saline\r\n       solutions (_see_ Chapter X.)\r\n\r\nCarbonic anhydride--which, like water, is formed with the development\r\nof a large amount of heat--is very stable. Only very few substances\r\nare capable of depriving it of its oxygen. However, certain metals,\r\nsuch as magnesium, potassium and the like, on being heated, burn in\r\nit, depositing carbon and forming oxides. If a mixture of carbonic\r\nanhydride and hydrogen be passed through a heated tube, the formation\r\nof water and carbonic oxide will be observed; CO_{2} + H_{2} = CO\r\n+ H_{2}O. But only a portion of the carbonic acid gas undergoes\r\nthis change, and therefore the result will be a mixture of carbonic\r\nanhydride, carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and water, which does not suffer\r\nfurther change under the action of heat.[17] Although, like water,\r\ncarbonic anhydride is exceedingly stable, still on being heated it\r\npartially decomposes into carbonic oxide and oxygen. Deville showed that\r\nsuch is the case if carbonic anhydride be passed through a long tube\r\ncontaining pieces of porcelain and heated to 1,300°. If the products\r\nof decomposition--namely, the carbonic oxide and oxygen--be suddenly\r\ncooled, they can be collected separately, although they partly reunite\r\ntogether. A similar decomposition of carbonic anhydride into carbonic\r\noxide and oxygen takes place on passing a series of electric sparks\r\nthrough it (for instance, in the eudiometer). Under these conditions\r\nan increase of volume occurs, because two volumes of CO_{2} give two\r\nvolumes of CO and one volume of O. The decomposition reaches a certain\r\nlimit (less than one-third) and does not proceed further, so that the\r\nresult is a mixture of carbonic anhydride, carbonic oxide, and oxygen,\r\nwhich is not altered in composition by the continued action of the\r\nsparks. This is readily understood, as it is a reversible reaction.\r\nIf the carbonic anhydride be removed, then the mixture explodes when\r\na spark is passed and forms carbonic anhydride.[17 bis] If from an\r\nidentical mixture the oxygen (and not the carbonic anhydride) be\r\nremoved, and a series of sparks be again passed, the decomposition is\r\nrenewed, and terminates with the complete dissociation of the carbonic\r\nanhydride. Phosphorus is used in order to effect the complete absorption\r\nof the oxygen. In these examples we see that a definite mixture of\r\nchangeable substances is capable of arriving at a state of stable\r\nequilibrium, destroyed, however, by the removal of one of the substances\r\ncomposing the mixture. This is one of the instances of the influence of\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n  [17] Hydrogen and carbon are near akin to oxygen as regards affinity,\r\n       but it ought to be considered that the affinity of hydrogen is\r\n       slightly greater than that of carbon, because during the\r\n       combustion of hydrocarbons the hydrogen burns first. Some idea of\r\n       this similarity of affinity may be formed by the quantity of heat\r\n       evolved. Gaseous hydrogen, H_{2}, on combining with an atom of\r\n       oxygen, O = 16, develops 69,000 heat-units if the water formed be\r\n       condensed to a liquid state. If the water remains in the form of a\r\n       gas (steam) the latent heat of evaporation must be subtracted, and\r\n       then 58,000 calories will be developed. Carbon, C, as a solid, on\r\n       combining with O_{2} = 32 develops about 97,000 calories, forming\r\n       gaseous CO_{2}. If it were gaseous like hydrogen, and only\r\n       contained C_{2} in its molecule, much more heat would be\r\n       developed, and judging by other substances, whose molecules on\r\n       passing from the solid to the gaseous state absorb about 10,000 to\r\n       15,000 calories, it must be held that gaseous carbon on forming\r\n       gaseous carbonic anhydride would develop not less than 110,000\r\n       calories--that is, approximately twice as much as is developed in\r\n       the formation of water. And since there is twice as much oxygen in\r\n       a molecule of carbonic anhydride as in a molecule of water, the\r\n       oxygen develops approximately the same quantity of heat on\r\n       combining with hydrogen as with carbon. That is to say, that here\r\n       we find the same close affinity (_see_ Chapter II., Note 7)\r\n       determined by the quantity of heat as between hydrogen, zinc, and\r\n       iron. For this reason here also, as in the case of hydrogen and\r\n       iron, we ought to expect an equal distribution of oxygen between\r\n       hydrogen and carbon, if they are both in excess compared with the\r\n       amount of oxygen; but if there be an excess of carbon, it will\r\n       decompose water, whilst an excess of hydrogen will decompose\r\n       carbonic anhydride. Even if these phenomena and similar ones have\r\n       been explained in isolated cases, a complete theory of the whole\r\n       subject is still wanting in the present condition of chemical\r\n       knowledge.\r\n\r\n  [17 bis] The degree or relative magnitude of the dissociation of CO_{2}\r\n       varies with the temperature and pressure--that is, it increases\r\n       with the temperature and as the pressure decreases. Deville found\r\n       that at a pressure of 1 atmosphere in the flame of carbonic oxide\r\n       burning in oxygen, about 40 per cent. of the CO_{2}, is decomposed\r\n       when the temperature is about 3,000°, and at 1,500° less than 1\r\n       per cent. (Krafts); whilst under a pressure of 10 atmospheres\r\n       about 34 per cent. is decomposed at 3,300° (Mallard and Le\r\n       Chatelier). It follows therefore that, under very small pressures,\r\n       the dissociation of CO_{2} will be considerable even at\r\n       comparatively moderate temperatures, but at the temperature of\r\n       ordinary furnaces (about 1,000°) even under the small partial\r\n       pressure of the carbonic acid, there are only small traces of\r\n       decomposition which may be neglected in a practical estimation of\r\n       the combustion of fuels. We may here cite the molecular specific\r\n       heat of CO_{2} (_i.e._ the amount of heat required to raise 44\r\n       units of weight of CO_{2} 1°), according to the determinations and\r\n       calculations of Mallard and Le Chatelier, for a constant volume\r\n       C_{v} = 6·26 + 0·0037_t_; for a constant pressure C_{p} = C_{v} +\r\n       2 (_see_ Chapter XIV., Note 7), _i.e._ the specific heat of CO_{2}\r\n       increases rapidly with a rise of temperature: for example, at 0°\r\n       (per 1 part by weight), it is, at a constant pressure = 0·188, at\r\n       1,000° = 0·272, at 2,000°, about 0·356. A perfectly distinct rise\r\n       of the specific heat (for example, at 2,000°, 0·409), is given by\r\n       a comparison of observations made by the above-mentioned\r\n       investigators and by Berthelot and Vieille (Kournakoff). The cause\r\n       of this must be looked for in dissociation. T. M. Cheltzoff,\r\n       however, considers upon the basis of his researches upon\r\n       explosives that it must be admitted that a maximum is reached at a\r\n       certain temperature (about 2,500°), beyond which the specific heat\r\n       begins to fall.\r\n\r\nAlthough carbonic anhydride is decomposed on heating, yielding\r\noxygen, it is nevertheless, like water, an unchangeable substance at\r\nordinary temperatures. Its decomposition, as effected by plants, is on\r\nthis account all the more remarkable; in this case the whole of the\r\noxygen of the carbonic anhydride is separated in the free state. The\r\nmechanism of this change is that the heat and light absorbed by the\r\nplants are expended in the decomposition of the carbonic anhydride.\r\nThis accounts for the enormous influence of temperature and light on\r\nthe growth of plants. But it is at present not clearly understood how\r\nthis takes place, or by what separate intermediate reactions the whole\r\nprocess of decomposition of carbonic anhydride in plants into oxygen and\r\nthe carbohydrates (Note 1) remaining in them, takes place. It is known\r\nthat sulphurous anhydride (in many ways resembling carbonic anhydride)\r\nunder the action of light (and also of heat) forms sulphur and sulphuric\r\nanhydride, SO_{3}, and in the presence of water, sulphuric acid. But\r\nno similar decomposition has been obtained directly with carbonic\r\nanhydride, although it forms an exceedingly easily decomposable higher\r\noxide--percarbonic acid;[18] and perhaps that is the reason the oxygen\r\nseparates. On the other hand, it is known that plants always form and\r\ncontain _organic acids_, and these must be regarded as derivatives of\r\ncarbonic acid, as is seen by all their reactions, of which we will\r\nshortly treat. For this reason it might be thought that the carbonic\r\nacid absorbed by the plants first forms (according to Baeyer) formic\r\naldehyde, CH_{2}O, and from it organic acids, and that these latter\r\nin their final transformation form all the other complex organic\r\nsubstances of the plants. Many organic acids are found in plants in\r\nconsiderable quantity; for instance, tartaric acid, C_{4}H_{6}O_{6},\r\nfound in grape-juice and in the acid juice of many plants; malic acid,\r\nC_{4}H_{6}O_{5}, found not only in unripe apples but in still larger\r\nquantities in mountain ash berries; citric acid, C_{6}H_{8}O_{7}, found\r\nin the acid juice of lemons, in gooseberries, cranberries, &c.; oxalic\r\nacid, C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}, found in wood-sorrel and many other plants.\r\nSometimes these acids exist in a free state in the plants, and sometimes\r\nin the form of salts; for instance, tartaric acid is met with in grapes\r\nas the salt known as cream of tartar, but in the impure state called\r\nargol, or tartar, C_{4}H_{5}KO_{6}. In sorrel we find the so-called\r\nsalts of sorrel, or acid potassium oxalate, C_{2}HKO_{4}. There is a\r\nvery clear connection between carbonic anhydride and the above-mentioned\r\norganic acids--namely, they all, under one condition or another, yield\r\ncarbonic anhydride, and can all be formed by means of it from substances\r\ndestitute of acid properties. The following examples afford the best\r\ndemonstration of this fact: if acetic acid, C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}, the acid\r\nof vinegar, be passed in the form of vapour through a heated tube, it\r\nsplits up into carbonic anhydride and marsh gas = CO_{2} + CH_{4}. But\r\nconversely it can also be obtained from those components into which it\r\ndecomposes. If one equivalent of hydrogen in marsh gas be replaced (by\r\nindirect means) by sodium, and the compound CH_{3}Na is obtained, this\r\ndirectly absorbs carbonic anhydride, forming a salt of acetic acid,\r\nCH_{3}Na + CO_{2} = C_{2}H_{3}NaO_{2}; from this acetic acid itself\r\nmay be easily obtained. Thus acetic acid decomposes into marsh gas\r\nand carbonic anhydride, and conversely is obtainable from them. The\r\nhydrogen of marsh gas does not, like that in acids, show the property\r\nof being directly replaced by metals; _i.e._ CH_{4} does not show any\r\nacid character whatever, but on combining with the elements of carbonic\r\nanhydride it acquires the properties of an acid. The investigation\r\nof all other organic acids shows similarly that their acid character\r\ndepends on their containing the elements of carbonic anhydride. For this\r\nreason there is no organic acid containing less oxygen in its molecule\r\nthan there is in carbonic anhydride; every organic acid contains in\r\nits molecule at least two atoms of oxygen. In order to express the\r\nrelation between carbonic acid, H_{2}CO_{3}, and organic acids, and in\r\norder to understand the reason of the acidity of these latter, it is\r\nsimplest to turn to that law of substitution which shows (Chapter VI.)\r\nthe relation between the hydrogen and oxygen compounds of nitrogen,\r\nand permits us (Chapter VIII.) to regard all hydrocarbons as derived\r\nfrom methane. If we have a given organic compound, A, which has not the\r\nproperties of an acid, but contains hydrogen connected to carbon, as in\r\nhydrocarbons, then ACO_{2} will be a monobasic organic acid, A2CO_{2}\r\na bibasic, A3CO_{2} a tribasic, and so on--that is, each molecule of\r\nCO_{2} transforms one atom of hydrogen into that state in which it may\r\nbe replaced by metals, as in acids. This furnishes a direct proof that\r\nin organic acids it is necessary to recognise the group HCO_{2}, or\r\ncarboxyl. If the addition of CO_{2} raises the basicity, the removal of\r\nCO_{2} lowers it. Thus from the bibasic oxalic acid, C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}, or\r\nphthalic acid, C_{8}H_{6}O_{4}, by eliminating CO_{2} (easily effected\r\nexperimentally) we obtain the monobasic formic acid, CH_{2}O_{2}, or\r\nbenzoic acid, C_{7}H_{6}O_{2}, respectively. The nature of carboxyl is\r\ndirectly explained by the law of substitution. Judging from what has\r\nbeen stated in Chapters VI. and VIII. concerning this law, it is evident\r\nthat CO_{2} is CH_{4} with the exchange of H_{4} for O_{2}, and that\r\nthe hydrate of carbonic anhydride, H_{2}CO_{3}, is CO(OH)_{2}, that is,\r\nmethane, in which two parts of hydrogen are replaced by two parts of\r\nthe water radical (OH, hydroxyl) and the other two by oxygen. Therefore\r\nthe group CO(OH), or carboxyl, HCO_{2}, is a part of carbonic acid,\r\nand is equivalent to (OH), and therefore also to H. That is, it is a\r\nunivalent residue of carbonic acid capable of replacing one atom of\r\nhydrogen. Carbonic acid itself is a bibasic acid, both hydrogen atoms\r\nin it being replaceable by metals, therefore carboxyl, which contains\r\none of the hydrogen atoms of carbonic acid, represents a group in which\r\nthe hydrogen is exchangeable for metals. And therefore if 1, 2 ... _n_\r\natoms of non-metallic hydrogen are exchanged 1, 2 ... _n_ times for\r\ncarboxyl, we ought to obtain 1, 2 ... _n_-basic acids. _Organic acids\r\nare the products of the carboxyl substitution in hydrocarbons._[18 bis]\r\nIf in the saturated hydrocarbons, C_{n}H_{2n + 2}, one part of\r\nhydrogen is replaced by carboxyl, the monobasic saturated (or fatty)\r\nacids, C_{n}H_{2n + 1}(CO_{2}H), will be obtained, as, for instance,\r\nformic acid, HCO_{2}H, acetic acid, CH_{2}CO_{2}H, ... stearic acid,\r\nC_{17}H_{35}CO_{2}H, &c. The double substitution will give bibasic\r\nacids, C_{n}H_{2n}(CO_{2}H)(CO_{2}H); for instance, oxalic acid _n_\r\n= 0, malonic acid _n_ = 1, succinic acid _n_ = 2, &c. To benzene,\r\nC_{6}H_{6} correspond benzoic acid, C_{6}H_{5}(CO_{2}H), phthalic acid\r\n(and its isomerides), C_{6}H_{4}(CO_{2}H)_{2}, up to mellitic acid,\r\nC_{6}(CO_{2}H)_{6}, in all of which the basicity is equal to the number\r\nof carboxyl groups. As many isomerides exist in hydrocarbons, it is\r\nreadily understood not only that such can exist also in organic acids,\r\nbut that their number and structure may be foreseen. This complex and\r\nmost interesting branch of chemistry is treated separately in organic\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\n  [18] Percarbonic acid, H_{2}CO_{4} (= H_{2}CO_{3} + O) is supposed\r\n       by A. Bach (1893) to be formed from carbonic acid in the action of\r\n       light upon plants, (in the same manner as, according to the above\r\n       scheme, sulphuric acid from sulphurous) with the formation of\r\n       carbon, which remains in the form of hydrates of carbon:\r\n       3H_{2}CO_{3} = 2H_{2}CO_{4} + CH_{2}O. This substance CH_{2}O\r\n       expresses the composition of formic aldehyde which, according to\r\n       Baeyer, by polymerisation and further changes, gives other\r\n       hydrates of carbon and forms the first product which is formed in\r\n       plants from CO_{2}. And Berthelot (1872) had already, at the time\r\n       of the discovery of persulphuric (Chapter XX.) and pernitric\r\n       (Chapter VI., Note 26) acids pointed out the formation of the\r\n       unstable percarbonic anhydride, CO_{3}. Thus, notwithstanding the\r\n       hypothetical nature of the above equation, it may be admitted all\r\n       the more as it explains the comparative abundance of peroxide of\r\n       hydrogen (Schöne, Chapter IV.) in the air, and this also at the\r\n       period of the most energetic growth of plants (in July), because\r\n       percarbonic acid should like all peroxides easily give H_{2}O_{2}.\r\n       Besides which Bach (1894) showed that, in the first place, traces\r\n       of formic aldehyde and oxidising agents (CO_{3} or H_{2}O_{2})\r\n       are formed under the simultaneous action of CO_{2} and sunlight\r\n       upon a solution containing a salt of uranium (which is oxidised),\r\n       and diethylaniline (which reacts with CH_{2}O), and secondly, that\r\n       by subjecting BaO_{2}, shaken up in water, to the action of a\r\n       stream of CO_{2} in the cold, extracting (also in the cold) with\r\n       ether, and then adding an alcoholic solution of NaHO, crystalline\r\n       plates of a sodium salt may be obtained, which with water evolve\r\n       oxygen and leave sodium carbonate; they are therefore probably the\r\n       per-salt. All these facts are of great interest and deserve\r\n       further verification and elaboration.\r\n\r\n  [18 bis] If CO_{2} is the anhydride of a bibasic acid, and carboxyl\r\n       corresponds with it, replacing the hydrogen of hydrocarbons, and\r\n       giving them the character of comparatively feeble acids, then\r\n       SO_{3} is the anhydride of an energetic bibasic acid, and\r\n       _sulphoxyl_, SO_{2}(OH), corresponds with it, being capable of\r\n       replacing the hydrogen of hydrocarbons, and forming comparatively\r\n       energetic _sulphur oxyacids_ (_sulphonic acids_); for instance,\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}(COOH), benzoic acid, and C_{6}H_{5}(SO_{2}OH),\r\n       benzenesulphonic acid, are derived from C_{6}H_{6}. As the\r\n       exchange of H for methyl, CH_{3}, is equivalent to the addition of\r\n       CH_{2}, the exchange of carboxyl, COOH, is equivalent to the\r\n       addition of CO_{2}; so the exchange of H for sulphoxyl is\r\n       equivalent to the addition of SO_{3}. The latter proceeds\r\n       directly, for instance: C_{6}H_{6} + SO_{3} =\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}(SO_{2}OH).\r\n\r\n       As accordingding to the determinations of Thomsen, the heat of\r\n       combustion of the _vapours_ of acids RCO_{2} is known where R is a\r\n       hydrocarbon, and the heat of combustion of the hydrocarbons R\r\n       themselves, it may be seen that the formation of acids, RCO_{2},\r\n       from R + CO_{2}, is always accompanied by a _small_ absorption or\r\n       development of heat. We give the heats of combustion in thousands\r\n       of calories, referred to the molecular weights of the\r\n       substances:--\r\n\r\n            R =        H_{2}  CH_{4}  C_{2}H_{6}  C_{6}H_{6}\r\n                       68·4    212       370         777\r\n            RCO_{2} =  69·4    225       387         766\r\n\r\n       Thus H_{2}, corresponds with formic acid, CH_{2}O_{2}; benzene,\r\n       C_{6}H_{6}, with benzoic acid, C_{7}H_{6}O_{2}. The data for the\r\n       latter are taken from Stohmann, and refer to the solid condition.\r\n       For formic acid Stohmann gives the heat of combustion as 59,000\r\n       calories in a liquid state, but in a state of vapour, 64·6\r\n       thousand units, which is much less than according to Thomsen.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Oxide._--This gas is formed whenever the combustion of\r\norganic substances takes place in the presence of a large excess of\r\nincandescent charcoal; the air first burns the carbon into carbonic\r\nanhydride, but this in penetrating through the red-hot charcoal is\r\ntransformed into carbonic oxide, CO_{2} + C = 2CO. By this reaction\r\ncarbonic oxide is prepared by passing carbonic anhydride through\r\ncharcoal at a red heat. It may be separated from the excess of carbonic\r\nanhydride by passing it through a solution of alkali, which does not\r\nabsorb carbonic oxide. This reduction of carbonic anhydride explains why\r\ncarbonic oxide is formed in ordinary clear fires, where the incoming\r\nair passes over a large surface of heated coal. A blue flame is then\r\nobserved burning above the coal; this is the burning carbonic oxide.\r\nWhen charcoal is burnt in stacks, or when a thick layer of coal is\r\nburning in a brazier, and under many similar circumstances, carbonic\r\noxide is also formed. In metallurgical processes, for instance when\r\niron is smelted from the ore, very often the same process of conversion\r\nof carbonic anhydride into carbonic oxide occurs, especially if the\r\ncombustion of the coal be effected in high, so-called blast, furnaces\r\nand ovens, where the air enters at the lower part and is compelled\r\nto pass through a thick layer of incandescent coal. In this way,\r\nalso, combustion with flame may be obtained from those kinds of fuel\r\nwhich under ordinary conditions burn without flame: for instance,\r\nanthracite, coke, charcoal. Heating by means of a gas-producer--that\r\nis, an apparatus producing combustible carbonic oxide from fuel--is\r\ncarried on in the same manner.[19] In transforming one part of charcoal\r\ninto carbonic oxide 2,420 heat units are given out, and on burning to\r\ncarbonic anhydride 8,080 heat units. It is evident that on transforming\r\nthe charcoal first into carbonic oxide we obtain a gas which in burning\r\nis capable of giving out 5,660 heat units for one part of charcoal. This\r\npreparatory transformation of fuel into carbonic oxide, or producer\r\ngas containing a mixture of carbonic oxide (about 1/3 by volume) and\r\nnitrogen (2/3 volume), in many cases presents most important advantages,\r\nas it is easy to completely burn gaseous fuel without an excess of\r\nair, which would lower the temperature.[20] In stoves where solid fuel\r\nis burnt it is impossible to effect the complete combustion of the\r\nvarious kinds of fuel without admitting an excess of air. Gaseous fuel,\r\nsuch as carbonic oxide, is easily completely mixed with air and burnt\r\nwithout excess of it. If, in addition to this, the air and gas required\r\nfor the combustion be previously heated by means of the heat which\r\nwould otherwise be uselessly carried off in the products of combustion\r\n(smoke)[21] it is easy to reach a high temperature, so high (about\r\n1,800°) that platinum may be melted. Such an arrangement is known as a\r\n_regenerative furnace_.[22] By means of this process not only may the\r\nhigh temperatures indispensable in many industries be obtained (for\r\ninstance, glass-working, steel-melting, &c.), but great advantage\r\nalso[23] is gained as regards the quantity of fuel, because the\r\ntransmission of heat to the object to be heated, other conditions being\r\nequal, is determined by the difference of temperatures.\r\n\r\n  [19] [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Gas-producer for the formation of carbon\r\n       monoxide for heating purposes.]\r\n\r\n       In gas-producers all carbonaceous fuels are transformed into\r\n       inflammable gas. In those which (on account of their slight\r\n       density and large amount of water, or incombustible admixtures\r\n       which absorb heat) are not as capable of giving a high temperature\r\n       in ordinary furnaces--for instance, fir cones, peat, the lower\r\n       kinds of coal, &c.--the same gas is obtained as with the best\r\n       kinds of coal, because the water condenses on cooling, and the\r\n       ashes and earthy matter remain in the gas-producer. The\r\n       construction of a gas-producer is seen from the accompanying\r\n       drawing. The fuel lies on the fire-bars O, the air enters through\r\n       them and the ash-hole (drawn by the draught of the chimney of the\r\n       stove where the gas burns, or else forced by a blowing apparatus),\r\n       the quantity of air being exactly regulated by means of valves.\r\n       The gases formed are then led by the tube V, provided with a\r\n       valve, into the gas main U. The addition of fuel ought to proceed\r\n       in such a way as to prevent the generated gas escaping; hence the\r\n       space A is kept filled with the combustible material and covered\r\n       with a lid.\r\n\r\n  [20] An excess of air lowers the temperature of combustion, because it\r\n       becomes heated itself, as explained in Chapter III. In ordinary\r\n       furnaces the excess of air is three or four times greater than the\r\n       quantity required for perfect combustion. In the best furnaces\r\n       (with fire-bars, regulated air supply, and corresponding chimney\r\n       draught) it is necessary to introduce twice as much air as is\r\n       necessary, otherwise the smoke contains much carbonic oxide.\r\n\r\n  [21] If in manufactories it is necessary, for instance, to maintain the\r\n       temperature in a furnace at 1,000°, the flame passes out at this\r\n       or a higher temperature, and therefore much fuel is lost in the\r\n       smoke. For the draught of the chimney a temperature of 100° to\r\n       150° is sufficient, and therefore the remaining heat ought to be\r\n       utilised. For this purpose the flues are carried under boilers or\r\n       other heating apparatus. The preparatory heating of the air is the\r\n       best means of utilisation when a high temperature is desired\r\n       (_see_ Note 22).\r\n\r\n  [22] Regenerative furnaces were introduced by the Brothers Siemens\r\n       about the year 1860 in many industries, and mark a most important\r\n       progress in the use of fuel, especially in obtaining high\r\n       temperatures. The principle is as follows: The products of\r\n       combustion from the furnace are led into a chamber, I, and heat up\r\n       the bricks in it, and then pass into the outlet flue; when the\r\n       bricks are at a red heat the products of combustion are passed (by\r\n       altering the valves) into another adjoining chamber, II, and air\r\n       requisite for the combustion of the generator gases is passed\r\n       through I. In passing round about the incandescent bricks the air\r\n       is heated, and the bricks are cooled--that is, the heat of the\r\n       smoke is returned into the furnace. The air is then passed through\r\n       II, and the smoke through I. The regenerative burners for\r\n       illuminating gas are founded on this same principle, the products\r\n       of combustion heat the incoming air and gas, the temperature is\r\n       higher, the light brighter, and an economy of gas is effected.\r\n       Absolute perfection in these appliances has, of course, not yet\r\n       been attained; further improvement is still possible, but\r\n       dissociation imposes a limit because at a certain high temperature\r\n       combinations do not ensue, possible temperatures being limited by\r\n       reverse reactions. Here, as in a number of other cases, the\r\n       further investigation of the matter must prove of direct value\r\n       from a practical point of view.\r\n\r\n  [23] At first sight it appears absurd, useless, and paradoxical to lose\r\n       nearly one-third of the heat which fuel can develop, by turning it\r\n       into gas. Actually the advantage is enormous, especially for\r\n       producing high temperatures, as is already seen from the fact that\r\n       fuels rich in oxygen (for instance, wood) when damp are unable,\r\n       with any kind of hearth whatever, to give the temperature required\r\n       for glass-melting or steel-casting, whilst in the gas-producer\r\n       they furnish exactly the same gas as the driest and most\r\n       carbonaceous fuel. In order to understand the principle which is\r\n       here involved, it is sufficient to remember that a large amount of\r\n       heat, but having a low temperature, is in many cases of no use\r\n       whatever. We are unable here to enter into all the details of the\r\n       complicated matter of the application of fuel, and further\r\n       particulars must be sought for in special technical treatises. The\r\n       following footnotes, however, contain certain fundamental figures\r\n       for calculations concerning combustion.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of carbonic anhydride, by means of charcoal, into\r\ncarbonic oxide (C + CO_{2} = CO + CO) is considered a reversible\r\nreaction, because at a high temperature the carbonic oxide splits up into\r\ncarbon and carbonic anhydride, as Sainte-Claire Deville showed by using\r\nthe method of the 'cold and hot tube.' Inside a tube heated in a furnace\r\nanother thin metallic (silvered copper) tube is fitted, through which a\r\nconstant stream of cold water flows. The carbonic oxide coming into\r\ncontact with the heated walls of the exterior tube forms charcoal, and\r\nits minute particles settle in the form of lampblack on the lower side of\r\nthe cold tube, and, since they are cooled, do not act further on the\r\noxygen or carbonic anhydride formed.[24] A series of electric sparks\r\nalso decomposes carbonic oxide into carbonic anhydride and carbon, and if\r\nthe carbonic anhydride be removed by alkali complete decomposition may be\r\nobtained (Deville).[24 bis] Aqueous vapour, which is so similar to\r\ncarbonic anhydride in many respects, acts, at a high temperature, on\r\ncharcoal in an exactly similar way, C + H_{2}O = H_{2} + CO. From 2\r\nvolumes of carbonic anhydride with charcoal 4 volumes of carbonic oxide\r\n(2 molecules) are obtained, and precisely the same from 2 volumes of\r\nwater vapour with charcoal 4 volumes of a gas consisting of hydrogen and\r\ncarbonic oxide (H_{2} + CO) are formed. This mixture of combustible gases\r\nis called _water gas_.[25] But aqueous vapour (and only when strongly\r\nsuperheated, otherwise it cools the charcoal) only acts on charcoal to\r\nform a large amount of carbonic oxide at a very high temperature (at\r\nwhich carbonic anhydride dissociates); it begins to react at about 500°,\r\nforming carbonic anhydride according to the equation C + 2H_{2}O = CO_{2}\r\n+ 2H_{2}. Besides this, carbonic oxide on splitting up forms carbonic\r\nanhydride, and therefore water gas always contains a mixture[26] in which\r\nhydrogen predominates, the volume of carbonic oxide being comparatively\r\nless, whilst the amount of carbonic anhydride increases as the\r\ntemperature of the reaction decreases (generally it is more than 3 per\r\ncent.)\r\n\r\n  [24] The first product of combustion of charcoal is always carbonic\r\n       anhydride, and not carbonic oxide. This is seen from the fact that\r\n       with a shallow layer of charcoal (less than a decimetre if the\r\n       charcoal be closely packed) carbonic oxide is not formed at all.\r\n       It is not even produced with a deep layer of charcoal if the\r\n       temperature is not above 500°, and the current of air or oxygen is\r\n       very slow. With a rapid current of air the charcoal becomes\r\n       red-hot, and the temperature rises, and then carbonic oxide\r\n       appears (Lang 1888). Ernst (1891) found that below 995° carbonic\r\n       oxide is always accompanied by CO_{2}, and that the formation of\r\n       CO_{2} begins about 400°. Naumann and Pistor determined that the\r\n       reaction of carbonic anhydride with carbon commences at about\r\n       550°, and that between water and carbon at about 500°. At the\r\n       latter temperature carbonic anhydride is formed, and only with a\r\n       rise of temperature is carbonic oxide formed (Lang) from the\r\n       action of the carbonic anhydride on the carbon, and from the\r\n       reaction CO_{2} + H_{2} = CO + H_{2}O. Rathke (1881) showed that\r\n       at no temperature whatever is the reaction as expressed by the\r\n       equation CO_{2} + C = 2CO_{2}, complete; a part of the carbonic\r\n       anhydride remains, and Lang determined that at about 1,000° not\r\n       less than 3 p.c. of the carbonic anhydride remains untransformed\r\n       into carbonic oxide, even after the action has been continued for\r\n       several hours. The endothermal reactions, C + 2H_{2}O = CO_{2}\r\n       +2H_{2}, and CO + H_{2}O = CO_{2} + H_{2}, are just as incomplete.\r\n       This is made clear if we note that on the one hand the\r\n       above-mentioned reactions are all reversible, and therefore\r\n       bounded by a limit; and, on the other hand, that at about 500°\r\n       oxygen begins to combine with hydrogen and carbon, and also that\r\n       the lower limits of dissociation of water, carbonic anhydride, and\r\n       carbonic oxide lie near one another between 500° and 1,200°. For\r\n       water and carbonic oxide the lower limit of the commencement of\r\n       dissociation is unknown, but judging from the published data\r\n       (according to Le Chatelier, 1888) that of carbonic anhydride may\r\n       be taken as about 1,050°. Even at about 200° half the carbonic\r\n       anhydride dissociates if the pressure be small, about 0·001\r\n       atmosphere. At the atmospheric pressure, not more than 0·05 p.c.\r\n       of the carbonic anhydride decomposes. The reason of the influence\r\n       of pressure is here evidently that the splitting up of carbonic\r\n       anhydride into carbonic oxide and oxygen is accompanied by an\r\n       increase in volume (as in the case of the dissociation of nitric\r\n       peroxide. _See_ Chapter VI., Note 46). As in stoves and lamps, and\r\n       also with explosive substances, the temperature is not higher than\r\n       2,000° to 2,500°, it is evident that although the partial pressure\r\n       of carbonic anhydride is small, still its dissociation cannot here\r\n       be considerable, and probably does not exceed 5 p.c.\r\n\r\n  [24 bis] Besides which L. Mond (1890) showed that the powder of freshly\r\n       reduced metallic nickel (obtained by heating the oxide to redness\r\n       in a stream of hydrogen) is able, when heated even to 350°, to\r\n       completely decompose carbonic oxide into CO_{2} and carbon, which\r\n       remains with the nickel and is easily removed from it by heating\r\n       in a stream of air. Here 2CO = CO_{2} + C. It should be remarked\r\n       that heat is evolved in this reaction (Note 25), and therefore\r\n       that the influence of 'contact' may here play a part. Indeed, this\r\n       reaction must be classed among the most remarkable instances of\r\n       the influence of contact, especially as metals analogous to Ni (Fe\r\n       and Co) do not effect this reaction (_see_ Chapter II., Note 17).\r\n\r\n  [25] A molecular weight of this gas, or 2 volumes CO (28 grams), on\r\n       combustion (forming CO_{2}) gives out 68,000 heat units (Thomsen\r\n       67,960 calories). A molecular weight of hydrogen, H_{2} (or 2\r\n       volumes), develops on burning into _liquid_ water 69,000 heat\r\n       units (according to Thomsen 68,300), but if it forms aqueous\r\n       vapour 58,000 heat units. Charcoal, resolving itself by combustion\r\n       into the molecular quantity of CO_{2} (2 volumes), develops 97,000\r\n       heat units. From the data furnished by these exothermal reactions\r\n       it follows: (1) that the oxidation of charcoal into carbonic oxide\r\n       develops 29,000 heat units; (2) that the reaction C + CO_{2} = 2CO\r\n       _absorbs_ 39,000 heat units; (3) C + H_{2}O = H_{2} + CO _absorbs_\r\n       (if the water be in a state of vapour) 29,000 calories, but if the\r\n       water be liquid 40,000 calories (almost as much as C + CO_{2});\r\n       (4) C + H_{2}O = CO_{2} + 2H_{2} _absorbs_ (if the water be in a\r\n       state of vapour) 19,000 heat units; (5) the reaction CO + H_{2}O =\r\n       CO_{2} + H_{2} _develops_ 10,000 heat units if the water be in the\r\n       state of vapour; and (6) the decomposition expressed by the\r\n       equation 2CO = C + CO_{2} (Note 24 bis) is accompanied by the\r\n       _evolution_ of 39,000 units of heat.\r\n\r\n       Hence it follows that 2 volumes of CO or H_{2} burning into CO_{2}\r\n       or H_{2}O develop almost the same amount of heat, just as also the\r\n       heat effects corresponding with the equations\r\n\r\n                         C + H_{2}O = CO + H_{2}\r\n\r\n                          C + CO_{2} = CO + CO\r\n\r\n       are nearly equal.\r\n\r\n  [26] _Water gas_, obtained from steam and charcoal at a white heat,\r\n       contains about 50 p.c. of hydrogen, about 40 p.c. of carbonic\r\n       oxide, about 5 p.c. of carbonic anhydride, the remainder being\r\n       nitrogen from the charcoal and air. Compared with producer gas,\r\n       which contains much nitrogen, this is a gas much richer in\r\n       combustible matter, and therefore capable of giving high\r\n       temperatures, and is for this reason of the greatest utility. If\r\n       carbonic anhydride could be as readily obtained in as pure a state\r\n       as water, then CO might be prepared directly from CO_{2} + C, and\r\n       in that case the utilisation of the heat of the carbon would be\r\n       the same as in water gas, because CO evolves as much heat as\r\n       H_{2}, and even more if the temperature of the smoke be over 100°,\r\n       and the water remains in the form of vapour (Note 25). But\r\n       producer gas contains a large proportion of nitrogen, so that its\r\n       effective temperature is below that given by water gas; therefore\r\n       in places where a particularly high temperature is required (for\r\n       instance, for lighting by means of incandescent lime or magnesia,\r\n       or for steel melting, &c.), and where the gas can be easily\r\n       distributed through pipes, water gas is at present held in high\r\n       estimation, but when (in ordinary furnaces, re-heating,\r\n       glass-melting, and other furnaces) a very high temperature is not\r\n       required, and there is no need to convey the gas in pipes,\r\n       producer gas is generally preferred on account of the simplicity\r\n       of its preparation, especially as for water gas such a high\r\n       temperature is required that the plant soon becomes damaged.\r\n\r\n       There are numerous systems for making water gas, but the American\r\n       patent of T. Lowe is generally used. The gas is prepared in a\r\n       cylindrical generator, into which hot air is introduced, in order\r\n       to raise the coke in it to a white heat. The products of\r\n       combustion containing carbonic oxide are utilised for superheating\r\n       steam, which is then passed over the white hot coke. Water gas, or\r\n       a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic oxide, is thus obtained.\r\n\r\n       Water gas is sometimes called '_the fuel of the future_,' because\r\n       it is applicable to all purposes, develops a high temperature, and\r\n       is therefore available, not only for domestic and industrial uses,\r\n       but also for gas-motors and for lighting. For the latter purpose\r\n       platinum, lime, magnesia, zirconia, and similar substances (as in\r\n       the Drummond light, Chapter III.), are rendered incandescent in\r\n       the flame, or else the gas is _carburetted_--that is, mixed with\r\n       the vapours of volatile hydrocarbons (generally benzene or\r\n       naphtha, naphthalene, or simply naphtha gas), which communicate to\r\n       the pale flame of carbonic oxide and hydrogen a great brilliancy,\r\n       owing to the high temperature developed by the combustion of the\r\n       non-luminous gases. As water gas, possessing these properties, may\r\n       be prepared at central works and conveyed in pipes to the\r\n       consumers, and as it may be produced from any kind of fuel, and\r\n       ought to be much cheaper than ordinary gas, it may as a matter of\r\n       fact be expected that in course of time (when experience shall\r\n       have determined the cheapest and best way to prepare it) it will\r\n       not only supplant ordinary gas, but will with advantage everywhere\r\n       replace the ordinary forms of fuel, which in many respects are\r\n       inconvenient. At present its consumption spreads principally for\r\n       lighting purposes, and for use in gas-engines instead of ordinary\r\n       illuminating gas. In some cases Dowson gas is prepared in\r\n       producers. This is a mixture of water and producer gases obtained\r\n       by passing steam into an ordinary producer (Note 19), when the\r\n       temperature of the carbon has become sufficiently high for the\r\n       reaction C + H_{2}O = CO + H_{2}.\r\n\r\nMetals like iron and zinc which at a red heat are capable of decomposing\r\nwater with the formation of hydrogen, also decompose carbonic anhydride\r\nwith the formation of carbonic oxide; so both the ordinary products of\r\ncomplete combustion, water and carbonic anhydride, are very similar in\r\ntheir reactions, and we shall therefore presently compare hydrogen and\r\ncarbonic oxide. The metallic oxides of the above-mentioned metals, when\r\nreduced by charcoal, also give carbonic oxide. Priestley obtained it by\r\nheating charcoal with zinc oxide. As free carbonic anhydride may be\r\ntransformed into carbonic oxide, so, in precisely the same way, may that\r\ncarbonic acid which is in a state of combination; hence, if magnesium or\r\nbarium carbonates (MgCO_{3} or BaCO_{3}) be heated to redness with\r\ncharcoal, or iron or zinc, carbonic oxide will be produced--for instance,\r\nit is obtained by heating an intimate mixture of 9 parts of chalk and 1\r\npart of charcoal in a clay retort.\r\n\r\nMany organic substances[27] on being heated, or under the action of\r\nvarious agents, yield carbonic oxide; amongst these are many organic\r\nor carboxylic acids. The simplest are formic and oxalic acids. Formic\r\nacid, CH_{2}O_{2}, on being heated to 200°, easily decomposes into\r\ncarbonic oxide and water, CH_{2}O_{2} = CO + H_{2}O.[27 bis] Usually,\r\nhowever, carbonic oxide is prepared in laboratories, not from formic\r\nbut from oxalic acid, C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}, the more so as formic acid is\r\nitself prepared from oxalic acid. The latter acid is easily obtained by\r\nthe action of nitric acid on starch, sugar, &c.; it is also found in\r\nnature. Oxalic acid is easily decomposed by heat; its crystals first\r\nlose water, then partly volatilise, but the greater part is decomposed.\r\nThe decomposition is of the following nature: it splits up into water,\r\ncarbonic oxide, and carbonic anhydride,[28] C_{2}H_{2}O_{4} = H_{2}O\r\n+ CO_{2} + CO. This decomposition is generally practically effected\r\nby mixing oxalic acid with strong sulphuric acid, because the latter\r\nassists the decomposition by taking up the water. On heating a mixture\r\nof oxalic and sulphuric acids a mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic\r\nanhydride is evolved. This mixture is passed through a solution of an\r\nalkali in order to absorb the carbonic anhydride, whilst the carbonic\r\noxide passes on.[28 bis]\r\n\r\n  [27] The so-called yellow prussiate, K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6}, on being heated\r\n       with ten parts of strong sulphuric acid forms a considerable\r\n       quantity of very pure carbonic oxide quite free from carbonic\r\n       anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [27 bis] To perform this reaction, the formic acid is mixed with\r\n       glycerine, because when heated alone it volatilises much below its\r\n       temperature of decomposition. When heated with sulphuric acid the\r\n       salts of formic acid yield carbonic oxide.\r\n\r\n  [28] The decomposition of formic and oxalic acids, with the formation\r\n       of carbonic oxide, considering these acids as carboxyl\r\n       derivatives, may be explained as follows:--The first is H(COOH)\r\n       and the second (COOH)_{2}, or H_{2} in which one or both halves of\r\n       the hydrogen are exchanged for carboxyl; therefore they are equal\r\n       to H_{2} + CO_{2} and H_{2} + 2CO_{2}; but H_{2} reacts with\r\n       CO_{2}, as has been stated above, forming CO and H_{2}O. From this\r\n       it is also evident that oxalic acid on losing CO_{2} forms formic\r\n       acid, and also that the latter may proceed from CO + H_{2}O, as we\r\n       shall see further on.\r\n\r\n  [28 bis] Greshoff (1888) showed that with a solution of nitrate of\r\n       silver, iodoform, CHI_{3}, forms CO according to the equation\r\n       CHI_{3} + 3AgNO_{3} + H_{2}O = 3AgI + 3HNO_{3} + CO. The reaction\r\n       is immediate and is complete.\r\n\r\nIn its physical _properties_ carbonic oxide resembles nitrogen; this is\r\nexplained by the equality of their molecular weights. The absence of\r\ncolour and smell, the low temperature of the absolute boiling point,\r\n-140° (nitrogen, -146°), the property of solidifying at -200°\r\n(nitrogen, -202°), the boiling point of -190° (nitrogen, -203°), and the\r\nslight solubility (Chapter I., Note 30), of carbonic oxide are almost the\r\nsame as in those of nitrogen. The chemical properties of both gases are,\r\nhowever, very different, and in these carbonic oxide resembles hydrogen.\r\nCarbonic oxide burns with a blue flame, giving 2 volumes of carbonic\r\nanhydride from 2 volumes of carbonic oxide, just as 2 volumes of hydrogen\r\ngive 2 volumes of aqueous vapour. It explodes with oxygen, in the\r\neudiometer, like hydrogen.[29] When breathed it acts as a strong poison,\r\nbeing absorbed by the blood;[30] this explains the action of charcoal\r\nfumes, the products of the incomplete combustion of charcoal and other\r\ncarbonaceous fuels. Owing to its faculty of combining with oxygen,\r\ncarbonic oxide acts as a powerful reducing agent, taking up the oxygen\r\nfrom many compounds at a red heat, and being itself transformed into\r\ncarbonic anhydride. The reducing action of carbonic oxide, however, is\r\n(like that of hydrogen, Chapter II.) naturally confined to those oxides\r\nwhich easily part with their oxygen--as, for instance, copper\r\noxide--whilst the oxides of magnesium or potassium are not reduced.\r\nMetallic iron itself is capable of reducing carbonic anhydride to\r\ncarbonic oxide, just as it liberates the hydrogen from water. Copper,\r\nwhich does not decompose water, does not decompose carbonic oxide. If a\r\nplatinum wire heated to 300°, or spongy platinum at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, be plunged into a mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen, or\r\nof hydrogen and oxygen, the mixture explodes. These reactions are very\r\nsimilar to those peculiar to hydrogen. The following important\r\ndistinction, however, exists between them--namely: the molecule of\r\nhydrogen is composed of H_{2}, a group of elements divisible into two\r\nlike parts, whilst, as the molecule of carbonic oxide, CO, contains\r\nunlike atoms of carbon and oxygen, in none of its reactions of\r\ncombination can it give two molecules of matter containing its elements.\r\nThis is particularly noticeable in the action of chlorine on hydrogen and\r\non carbonic oxide respectively; with the former chlorine forms hydrogen\r\nchloride, and with the latter it produces the so-called carbonyl\r\nchloride, COCl_{2}: that is to say, the molecule of hydrogen, H_{2},\r\nunder the action of chlorine divides, forming two molecules of\r\nhydrochloric acid, whilst the molecule of carbonic oxide enters in its\r\nentirety into the molecule of carbonyl chloride. This characterises the\r\nso-called _diatomic_ or _bivalent_ reactions of radicles or _residues_.\r\nH is a monatomic residue or radicle, like K, Cl, and others, whilst\r\ncarbonic oxide, CO, is an indivisible (undecomposable) bivalent radicle,\r\nequivalent to H_{2} and not to H, and therefore combining with X_{2} and\r\ninterchangeable with H_{2}. This distinction is evident from the annexed\r\ncomparison:\r\n\r\n        HH, hydrogen.            CO, carbonic oxide.\r\n        HCl, hydrochloric acid.  COCl_{2}, carbonyl chloride.\r\n        HKO, potash.             CO(KO)_{2}, potassium carbonate.\r\n        HNH_{2}, ammonia.        CO(NH_{2})_{2}, urea.\r\n        HCH_{3}, methane.        CO(CH_{3})_{2}, acetone.\r\n        HHO, water.              CO(HO)_{2}, carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n  [29] It is remarkable that, according to the investigations of Dixon,\r\n       perfectly dry carbonic oxide does not explode with oxygen when a\r\n       spark of low intensity is used, but an explosion takes place if\r\n       there is the slightest admixture of moisture. L. Meyer, however,\r\n       showed that sparks of an electric discharge of considerable\r\n       intensity produce an explosion. N. N. Beketoff demonstrated that\r\n       combustion proceeds and spreads slowly unless there be perfect\r\n       dryness. I think that this may he explained by the fact that water\r\n       with carbonic oxide gives carbonic anhydride and hydrogen, but\r\n       hydrogen with oxygen gives hydrogen peroxide (Chapter VII.), which\r\n       with carbonic oxide forms carbonic anhydride and water. The water,\r\n       therefore, is renewed, and again serves the same purpose. But it\r\n       may be that here it is necessary to acknowledge a simple contact\r\n       influence. After Dixon had shown the influence of traces of\r\n       moisture upon the reaction CO + O, many researches were made of a\r\n       similar nature. The fullest investigation into the influence of\r\n       moisture upon the course of many chemical reactions was made by\r\n       Baker in 1894. He showed that with perfect dryness, many chemical\r\n       transformations (for example, the formation of ozone from oxygen,\r\n       the decomposition of AgO, KClO_{3} under the action of heat, &c.)\r\n       proceeds in exactly the same manner as in the presence of\r\n       moisture; but that in many cases traces of moisture have an\r\n       evident influence. We may mention the following instances: (1) Dry\r\n       SO_{3} does not act upon dry CaO or CuO; (2) perfectly dry\r\n       sal-ammoniac does not give NH_{3} with dry CaO, but simply\r\n       volatilises; (3) dry NO and O do not react; (4) perfectly dry\r\n       NH_{3} and HCl do not combine; (5) perfectly dry sal-ammoniac does\r\n       not dissociate at 350° (Chapter VII., Note 15 bis); and (6)\r\n       perfectly dry chlorine does not act upon metals, &c.\r\n\r\n  [30] Carbonic oxide is very rapid in its action, because it is absorbed\r\n       by the blood in the same way as oxygen. In addition to this, the\r\n       absorption spectrum of the blood changes so that by the help of\r\n       blood it is easy to detect the slightest traces of carbonic oxide\r\n       in the air. M. A. Kapoustin found that linseed oil and therefore\r\n       oil paints, are capable of giving off carbonic oxide while drying\r\n       (absorbing oxygen).\r\n\r\nSuch monatmic (univalent) residues, X, as H, Cl, Na, NO_{2}, NH_{4},\r\nCH_{3}, CO_{2}H (carboxyl), OH, and others, in accordance with\r\nthe law of substitution, combine together, forming compounds, XX';\r\nand with oxygen, or in general with diatomic (bivalent) residues,\r\nY--for instance, O, CO, CH_{2}, S, Ca, &c. forming compounds XX´Y; but\r\ndiatomic residues, Y, sometimes capable of existing separately may\r\ncombine together, forming YY´ and with X_{2} or XX´, as we see from\r\nthe transition of CO into CO_{2} and COCl_{2}. This combining power of\r\ncarbonic oxide appears in many of its reactions. Thus it is very easily\r\nabsorbed by cuprous chloride, CuCl, dissolved in fuming hydrochloric\r\nacid, forming a crystalline compound, COCu_{2}Cl_{2},2H_{2}O,\r\ndecomposable by water; it combines directly with potassium (at 90°),\r\nforming (KCO)_{_n_}[31] with platinum dichloride, PtCl_{2}, with\r\nchlorine, Cl_{2}, &c.\r\n\r\n  [31] The molecule of metallic potassium (Scott, 1887), like that of\r\n       mercury, contains only one atom, and it is probably in virtue of\r\n       this that the molecules CO and K combine together. But as in the\r\n       majority of cases potassium acts as a univalent radicle, the\r\n       polymeride K_{2}C_{2}O_{2} is formed, and probably\r\n       K_{10}C_{10}O_{10}, because products containing C_{10} are formed\r\n       by the action of hydrochloric acid. The black mass formed by the\r\n       combination of carbonic oxide with potassium explodes with great\r\n       ease, and oxidises in the air. Although Brodie, Lerch, and Joannis\r\n       (who obtained it in 1873 in a colourless form by means of NH_{3}K,\r\n       described in Chapter VI., Note 14) have greatly extended our\r\n       knowledge of this compound, much still remains unexplained. It\r\n       probably exists in various polymeric and isomeric forms, having\r\n       the composition (KCO)_{_n_} and (NaCO)_{_n_}.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable compounds are (1) the compound of CO with\r\nmetallic nickel, a colourless volatile liquid, Ni(CO)_{4}, obtained by\r\nL. Mond (described in Chapter XXII.) and (2) the compounds of carbonic\r\noxide with the alkalis, for instance with potassium or barium hydroxide,\r\n&c.--although it is not directly absorbed by them, as it has no acid\r\nproperties. Berthelot (1861) showed that potash in the presence of water\r\nis capable of absorbing carbonic oxide, but the absorption takes place\r\nslowly, little by little, and it is only after being heated for many\r\nhours that the whole of the carbonic oxide is absorbed by the potash. The\r\nsalt CHKO_{2} is obtained by this absorption; it corresponds with an acid\r\nfound in nature--namely, the simplest organic (carboxylic) acid, _formic\r\nacid_, CH_{2}O_{2}. It can be extracted from the potassium salt by means\r\nof distillation with dilute sulphuric acid, just as nitric acid is\r\nprepared from sodium nitrate. The same acid is found in ants and in\r\nnettles (when the stings of the nettles puncture the skin they break, and\r\nthe corrosive formic acid enters into the body); it is also obtained\r\nduring the action of oxidising agents on many organic substances; it is\r\nformed from oxalic acid, and under many conditions splits up into\r\ncarbonic oxide and water. In the formation of formic acid from carbonic\r\noxide we observe an example of the synthesis of organic compounds, such\r\nas are now very numerous, and are treated of in detail in works on\r\norganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nFormic acid, H(CHO_{2}), carbonic acid, HO(CHO_{2}), and oxalic acid,\r\n(CHO_{2})_{2}, are the simple organic or carboxylic acids, R(CHO_{2})\r\ncorresponding with HH and HOH. Commencing with carbonic oxide, CO, the\r\nformation of carboxylic acids is clearly seen from the fact that CO is\r\ncapable of combining with X_{2}, that is of forming COX_{2}. If, for\r\ninstance, one X is an aqueous residue, OH (hydroxyl), and the other X\r\nis hydrogen, then the simplest organic acid--formic acid, H(COOH)--is\r\nobtained. As all hydrocarbons (Chapter VIII.) correspond with the\r\nsimplest, CH_{4}, so all organic acids may be considered to proceed from\r\nformic acid.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way it is easy to explain the relation to other compounds\r\nof carbon of those compounds which contain nitrogen. By way of an\r\nexample, we will take one of the carboxyl acids, R(CO_{2}H), where R is\r\na hydrocarbon radicle (residue). Such an acid, like all others, will\r\ngive by combination with NH_{3} an ammoniacal salt, R(CO_{2}NH_{4}).\r\nThis salt contains the elements for the formation of two molecules of\r\nwater, and under suitable conditions by the action of bodies capable\r\nof taking it up, water may in fact be separated from R(CO_{2}NH_{4}),\r\nforming by the loss of one molecule of water, _amides_, RCONH_{2}, and\r\nby the loss of two molecules of water, _nitriles_, RCN, otherwise known\r\nas _cyanogen compounds_ or _cyanides_.[32] If all the carboxyl acids are\r\nunited not only by many common reactions but also by a mutual conversion\r\ninto each other (an instance of which we saw above in the conversion\r\nof oxalic acid into formic and carbonic acids) one would expect the\r\nsame for all the cyanogen compounds also. The common character of\r\ntheir reactions, and the reciprocity of their transformation, were\r\nlong ago observed by Gay-Lussac, who recognised a common group or\r\nradicle (residue) cyanogen, CN, in all of them. The simplest compounds\r\nare _hydrocyanic_ or _prussic acid_, HCN, cyanic acid, OHCN, and free\r\ncyanogen, (CN)_{2}, which correspond to the three simplest carboxyl\r\nacids: formic, HCO_{2}H, carbonic, OHCO_{2}H, and oxalic, (CO_{2}H)_{2}.\r\nCyanogen, like carboxyl, is evidently a monatomic residue and acid,\r\nsimilar to chlorine. As regards the amides RCONH_{2}, corresponding\r\nto the carboxyl acids, they contain the ammoniacal residue NH_{2},\r\nand form a numerous class of organic compounds met with in nature and\r\nobtained in many ways,[33] but not distinguished by such characteristic\r\npeculiarities as the cyanogen compounds.\r\n\r\n  [32] The connection of the cyanogen compounds with the rest of the\r\n       hydrocarbons by means of carboxyl was enunciated by me, about the\r\n       year 1860, at the first Annual Meeting of the Russian Naturalists.\r\n\r\n  [33] Thus, for instance, _oxamide_, or the amide of oxalic acid,\r\n       (CNH_{2}O)_{2}, is obtained in the form of an insoluble\r\n       precipitate on adding a solution of ammonia to an alcoholic\r\n       solution of ethyl oxalate, (CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5})_{2}, which is formed\r\n       by the action of oxalic acid on alcohol: (CHO_{2})_{2} +\r\n       2(C_{2}H_{5})OH = 2HOH + (CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5})_{2}. As the nearest\r\n       derivatives of ammonia, the amides treated with alkalis yield\r\n       ammonia and form the salt of the acid. The nitriles do not,\r\n       however, give similar reactions so readily. The majority of amides\r\n       corresponding to acids have a composition RNH_{2}, and therefore\r\n       recombine with water with great ease even when simply boiled with\r\n       it, and with still greater facility in presence of acids or\r\n       alkalis. Under the action of alkalis the amides naturally give off\r\n       ammonia, through the combination of water with the amide, when a\r\n       salt of the acid from which the amide was derived is formed:\r\n       RNH_{2} + KHO = RKO + NH_{3}.\r\n\r\n       The same reaction takes place with acids, only an ammoniacal salt\r\n       of the acid is of course formed whilst the acid held in the amide\r\n       is liberated: RNH_{2} + HCl + H_{2}O = RHO + NH_{4}Cl.\r\n\r\n       Thus in the majority of cases amides easily pass into ammoniacal\r\n       salts, but they differ essentially from them. No ammoniacal salt\r\n       sublimes or volatilises unchanged, and generally when heated it\r\n       gives off water and yields an amide, whilst many amides volatilise\r\n       without alteration and frequently are volatile crystalline\r\n       substances which may be easily sublimed. Such, for instance, are\r\n       the amides of benzoic, formic, and many other organic acids.\r\n\r\nThe reactions and properties of the amides and nitriles of the organic\r\nacids are described in detail in books on organic chemistry; we will here\r\nonly touch upon the simplest of them, and to clearly explain the\r\nderivative compounds will first consider the ammoniacal salts and amides\r\nof carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nAs carbonic acid is bibasic, its ammonium salts ought to have the\r\nfollowing composition: _acid carbonate of ammonium_, H(NH_{4})CO_{3},\r\nand _normal carbonate_, (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3}; they represent compounds\r\nof one or two molecules of ammonia with carbonic acid. The acid salt\r\nappears in the form of a non-odoriferous and (when tested with litmus)\r\nneutral substance, soluble at the ordinary temperature in six parts\r\nof water, insoluble in alcohol, and obtainable in a crystalline form\r\neither without water of crystallisation or with various proportions\r\nof it. If an aqueous solution of ammonia be saturated with an excess\r\nof carbonic anhydride, and then evaporated over sulphuric acid in\r\nthe bell jar of an air-pump, crystals of this salt are separated.\r\nSolutions of all other ammonium carbonates, when evaporated under\r\nthe air-pump, yield crystals of this salt. A solution of this salt,\r\neven at the ordinary temperature, gives off carbonic anhydride, as do\r\nall the acid salts of carbonic acid (for instance, NaHCO_{3}), and\r\nat 38° the separation of carbonic anhydride takes place with great\r\nrapidity. _On losing carbonic anhydride_ and water, the acid salt is\r\nconverted into the normal salt, 2(NH_{4})HCO_{3} = H_{2}O + CO_{2} +\r\n(NH_{4})2CO_{3}; the latter, however, decomposes in solution, and can\r\ntherefore only be obtained in crystals, (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3},H_{2}O, at\r\nlow temperatures, and from solutions containing _an excess of ammonia_\r\nas the product of dissociation of this salt: (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = NH_{3}\r\n+ (NH_{4})HCO_{3}. But the normal salt,[34] according to the general\r\ntype, is capable of decomposing _with separation of water_, and forming\r\n_ammonium carbamate_, NH_{4}O(CONH_{2}) = (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3}-H_{2}O;\r\nthis still further complicates the chemical transformations of the\r\ncarbonates of ammonium. It is in fact evident that, by changing the\r\nratios of water, ammonia, and carbonic acid, various intermediate salts\r\nwill be formed containing mixtures or combinations of those mentioned\r\nabove. Thus the ordinary commercial _carbonate of ammonia_ is obtained\r\nby heating a mixture of chalk and sulphate of ammonia (Chapter VI.),\r\nor sal-ammoniac, 2NH_{4}Cl + CaCO_{3} = CaCl_{2} + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3}.\r\nThe normal salt, however, through loss of part of the ammonia, partly\r\nforms the acid salt, and, partly through loss of water, forms carbamate,\r\nand most frequently presents the composition NH_{4}O(CONH_{2}) +\r\n2OH(CO_{2}NH_{4}) = 4NH_{3} + 3CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O. This salt, in parting\r\nunder various conditions with ammonia, carbonic anhydride, and water,\r\ndoes not present a constant composition, and ought rather to be regarded\r\nas a mixture of acid salt and amide salt. The latter must be recognised\r\nas entering into the composition of the ordinary carbonate of ammonia,\r\nbecause it contains less water than is required for the normal or acid\r\nsalt;[35] but on being dissolved in water this salt gives a mixture of\r\nacid and normal salts.\r\n\r\n  [34] The acid salt, (NH_{4})HCO_{3}, on losing water ought to form the\r\n       _carbamic acid_, OH(CNH_{2}O); but it is not formed, which is\r\n       accounted for by the instability of the acid salt itself. Carbonic\r\n       anhydride is given off and ammonia is produced, which gives\r\n       ammonium carbamate.\r\n\r\n  [35] In the normal salt, 2NH_{3} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O, in the acid salt,\r\n       NH_{3} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O, but in the commercial salt only 2H_{2}O\r\n       to 3CO_{2}.\r\n\r\nEach of the two ammoniacal salts of carbonic acid has its corresponding\r\namide. That of the acid salt should be acid, if the water given off takes\r\nup the hydrogen of the ammonia, as it should according to the common type\r\nof formation of the amides, so that OHCONH_{2}, or _carbamic acid_, is\r\nformed from OHCO_{3}NH_{4}. This acid is not known in a free state, but\r\nits corresponding ammoniacal salt or _ammonium carbamate_ is known. The\r\nlatter is easily and immediately formed by mixing 2 volumes of _dry_\r\nammonia with 1 volume of dry carbonic anhydride, 2NH_{3} + CO_{2} =\r\nNH_{4}O(CONH_{2}); it is a solid substance, smells strongly of ammonia,\r\nattracts moisture from the air, and decomposes completely at 60°. The\r\nfact of this decomposition may be proved[36] by the density of its\r\nvapour, which = 13 (H = 1); this exactly corresponds with the density of\r\na mixture of 2 volumes of ammonia and 1 volume of carbonic anhydride. It\r\nis easily understood that such a combination will take place with any\r\nammonium carbonate under the action of salts which take up the water--for\r\ninstance, sodium or potassium carbonate[37]--as in an anhydrous state\r\nammonia and carbonic anhydride only form one compound, CO_{2}2NH_{3}.[38]\r\nAs the normal ammonium carbonate contains two ammonias, and as the amides\r\nare formed with the separation of water at the expense of the hydrogen of\r\nthe ammonias, so this salt has its symmetrical amide, CO(NH_{2})_{2}.\r\nThis must be termed carbamide. It is identical with urea, CN_{2}H_{4}O,\r\nwhich, contained in the urine (about 2 per cent. in human urine), is for\r\nthe higher animals (especially the carnivorous) the ordinary product of\r\nexcretion[39] and oxidation of the nitrogenous substances found in the\r\norganism. If ammonium carbamate be heated to 140° (in a sealed tube,\r\nBazaroff), or if carbonyl chloride, COCl_{2}, be treated with ammonia\r\n(Natanson), urea will be obtained, which shows its direct connection with\r\ncarbonic acid--that is, the presence of carbonic acid and ammonia in it.\r\nFrom this it will be understood how urea during the putrefaction of urine\r\nis converted into ammonium carbonate, CN_{2}H_{4}O + H_{2}O = CO_{2} +\r\n2NH_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [36] Naumann determined the following dissociation tensions of\r\n       the vapour of ammonium carbamate (in millimetres of mercury):--\r\n\r\n                 -10°  0°  +10°  20°  30°  40°  50°  60°\r\n                   5   12   30   62   124  248  470  770\r\n\r\n       Horstmann and Isambert studied the tensions corresponding to\r\n       excess of NH_{3} or CO_{2}, and found, as might have been\r\n       expected, that with such excess the mass of the salt formed (in a\r\n       solid state) increases and the decomposition (transition into\r\n       vapour) decreases.\r\n\r\n  [37] Calcium chloride enters into double decomposition with ammonium\r\n       carbamate. Acids (for instance, sulphuric) take up ammonia, and\r\n       set free carbonic anhydride; whilst alkalis (such as potash) take\r\n       up carbonic anhydride and set free ammonia, and therefore, in this\r\n       case for removing water only sodium or potassium carbonate can be\r\n       taken. An aqueous solution of ammonium carbamate does not entirely\r\n       precipitate a solution of CaCl_{2}, probably because calcium\r\n       carbamate is soluble in water, and all the (NH_{3})_{2}CO_{2} is\r\n       not converted by dissolving into the normal salt,\r\n       (NH_{4}O)_{2}CO_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [38] It must be imagined that the reaction takes place at first between\r\n       equal volumes (Chapter VII.); but then carbamic acid,\r\n       HO(CNH_{2}O), is produced, which, as an acid, immediately combines\r\n       with the ammonia, forming NH_{4}O(CNH_{2}O).\r\n\r\n  [39] Urea is undoubtedly a product of the oxidation of complex\r\n       nitrogenous matters (albumin) of the animal body. It is found in\r\n       the blood. It is absorbed from the blood by the kidneys. A man\r\n       excretes about 30 grams of urea per day. As a derivative of\r\n       carbonic anhydride, into which it is readily converted, urea is in\r\n       a sense a product of oxidation.\r\n\r\nThus urea, both by its origin and decomposition, is an amide of carbonic\r\nacid. Representing as it does ammonia (two molecules) in which hydrogen\r\n(two atoms) is replaced by the bivalent radicle of carbonic acid, urea\r\nretains the property of ammonia of entering into combination, with acids\r\n(thus nitric acid forms CN_{2}H_{4}O,HNO_{3}), with bases (for instance,\r\nwith mercury oxide), and with salts (such as sodium chloride, ammonium\r\nchloride), but containing an acid residue it has no alkaline properties.\r\nIt is soluble in water without change, but at a red heat loses ammonia\r\nand forms _cyanic acid_, CNHO,[39 bis] which is a nitrile of carbonic\r\nacid--that is to say, is a cyanogen compound, corresponding to the acid\r\nammonium carbonate, OH(CNH_{4}O_{2}), which on parting with 2H_{2}O ought\r\nto form cyanic acid, CNOH. Liquid cyanic acid, exceedingly unstable at\r\nthe ordinary temperatures, gives its stable solid polymer cyanuric acid,\r\nO_{3}H_{3}C_{3}N_{3}. Both have the same composition, and they pass one\r\ninto another at different temperatures. If crystals of cyanuric acid be\r\nheated to a temperature, _t_°, then the vapour tension, _p_, in\r\nmillimetres of mercury (Troost and Hautefeuille) will be:\r\n\r\n             _t._  160°,  170°,  200°,  250°,  300°,   350°\r\n             _p._   56,    68,   130,   220,   430,  1,200\r\n\r\nThe vapour contains cyanic acid, and, if it be rapidly cooled, it\r\ncondenses into a mobile volatile liquid (specific gravity at 0° =\r\n1·14). If the liquid cyanic acid be gradually heated, it passes into\r\na new amorphous polymeride (cyamelide), which, on being heated, like\r\ncyanuric acid, forms vapours of cyanic acid. If these fumes are heated\r\nabove 150° they pass directly into cyanuric acid. Thus at a temperature\r\nof 350°, the pressure does not rise above 1,200 mm. on the addition of\r\nvapours of cyanic acid, because the whole excess is transformed into\r\ncyanuric acid. Hence, the above-mentioned figures give the tension\r\nof dissociation of cyanuric acid, or the greatest pressure which the\r\nvapours of HOCN are able to attain at a given temperature, whilst at\r\na greater pressure, or by the introduction of a larger mass of the\r\nsubstance into a given volume, the whole of the excess is converted into\r\ncyanuric acid. The properties of cyanic acid which we have described\r\nwere principally observed by Wöhler, and clearly show the _faculty of\r\npolymerisation of cyanogen compounds_. This is observed in many other\r\ncyanogen derivatives, and is to be regarded as the consequence of the\r\nabove-mentioned explanation of their nature. All cyanogen compounds are\r\nammonium salts, R(CNH_{4}O_{2}), deprived of water, 2H_{2}O; therefore\r\nthe molecules, RCN, ought to possess the faculty of combining with two\r\nmolecules of water or with other molecules in exchange for it (for\r\ninstance, with H_{2}S, or HCl, or 2H_{2}, &c.), and are therefore\r\ncapable of combining together. The combination of molecules of the same\r\nkind to form more complex ones is what is meant by polymerisation.[40]\r\n\r\n  [39 bis] Its polymer, C_{3}N_{3}H_{3}O_{3}, is formed together\r\n       with it. Cyanic acid is a very unstable, easily changeable liquid,\r\n       while cyanuric acid is a crystalline solid which is very stable at\r\n       the ordinary temperature.\r\n\r\n  [40] Just as the aldehydes (such as C_{2}H_{4}O) are alcohols (like\r\n       C_{2}H_{6}O) which have lost hydrogen and are also capable of\r\n       entering into combination with many substances, and of\r\n       polymerising, forming slightly volatile polymerides, which\r\n       depolymerise on heating. Although there are also many similar\r\n       phenomena (for instance, the transformation of yellow into red\r\n       phosphorus, the transition of cinnamene into metacinnamene, &c.)\r\n       of polymerisation, in no other case are they so clearly and simply\r\n       expressed as in cyanic acid. The details relating to this must be\r\n       sought for in treatises on organic and theoretical chemistry. If\r\n       we touch on certain sides of this question it is principally with\r\n       the view of showing the phenomenon of polymerisation by typical\r\n       examples, for it is of more frequent occurrence than was formerly\r\n       supposed among compounds of several elements.\r\n\r\nBesidea being a substance very prone to form polymerides, cyanic acid\r\npresents many other features of interest, expounded in greater detail in\r\norganic chemistry. However we may mention here the production of the\r\ncyanates by the oxidation of the metallic cyanides. Potassium cyanate,\r\nKCNO, is most often obtained in this way. Solutions of cyanates by the\r\naddition of sulphuric acid yield cyanic acid, which, however, immediately\r\ndecomposes: CNHO + H_{2}O = CO_{2} + NH_{3}. A solution of ammonium\r\ncyanate, CN(NH_{4})O, behaves in the same manner, but only in the cold.\r\nOn being heated it completely changes because it is transformed into\r\nurea. The composition of both substances is identical, CN_{2}H_{4}O, but\r\nthe structure, or disposition of, and connection between, the elements is\r\ndifferent: in the ammonium cyanate one atom of nitrogen exists in the\r\nform of cyanogen, CN--that is, united with carbon--and the other as\r\nammonium, NH_{4}, but, as cyanic acid contains the hydroxyl radicle of\r\ncarbonic acid, OH(CN), the ammonium in this salt is united with oxygen.\r\nThe composition of this salt is best expressed by supposing one atom of\r\nthe hydrogen in water to be replaced by ammonium and the other by\r\ncyanogen--_i.e._ that its composition is not symmetrical--whilst in urea\r\nboth the nitrogen atoms are symmetrically and uniformly disposed as\r\nregards the radicle CO of carbonic acid: CO(NH_{2})_{2}. For this reason,\r\nurea is much more stable than ammonium cyanate, and therefore the latter,\r\non being slightly heated in solution, is converted into urea. This\r\nremarkable isomeric transformation was discovered by Wöhler in 1828.[41]\r\nFormamide, HCONH_{2}, and _hydrocyanic acid_, HCN, as a nitrile,\r\ncorrespond with formic acid, HCOOH, and therefore ammonium formate,\r\nHCOONH_{4}, and formamide, when acted on by heat and by substances which\r\ntake up water (phosphoric anhydride) form hydrocyanic acid, HCN, whilst,\r\nunder many conditions (for instance, on combining with hydrochloric acid\r\nin presence of water), this hydrocyanic acid forms formic acid and\r\nammonia. Although containing hydrogen in the presence of two acid-forming\r\nelements--namely, carbon and nitrogen[42]--hydrocyanic acid does not\r\ngive an acid reaction with litmus (cyanic acid has very marked acid\r\nproperties); _but it forms salts_, _MCN_, thus presenting the properties\r\nof a feeble acid, and for this reason is called an _acid_. The small\r\namount of energy which it has is shown by the fact that the cyanides of\r\nthe alkali metals--for instance, potassium cyanide (KHO + HCN = H_{2}0 +\r\nKCN) in solution have a strongly alkaline reaction.[43] If ammonia be\r\npassed over charcoal at a red heat, especially in the presence of an\r\nalkali, or if gaseous nitrogen be passed through a mixture of charcoal\r\nand an alkali (especially potash, KHO), and also if a mixture of\r\nnitrogenous organic substances and alkali be heated to a red heat, in all\r\nthese cases the alkali metal combines with the carbon and nitrogen,\r\nforming a metallic cyanide, MCN--for example, KCN.[43 bis] Potassium\r\ncyanide is much used in the arts, and is obtained, as above stated, under\r\nmany circumstances--as, for instance, in iron smelting, especially with\r\nthe assistance of wood charcoal, the ash of which contains much potash.\r\nThe nitrogen of the air, the alkali of the ash, and the charcoal are\r\nbrought into contact at a high temperature during iron smelting, and\r\ntherefore, under these conditions, a considerable quantity of potassium\r\ncyanide is formed. In practice it is not usual to prepare potassium\r\ncyanide directly, but a peculiar compound of it containing potassium,\r\niron, and cyanogen. This compound is potassium ferrocyanide, and is also\r\nknown as _yellow prussiate of potash_. This saline substance (_see_\r\nChapter XXII) has the composition K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6} + 2H_{2}O. The name\r\nof cyanogen ([Greek: kuanos]) is derived from the property which this\r\nyellow prussiate possesses of forming, with a solution of a ferric salt,\r\nFeX_{3}, the familiar pigment Prussian blue. The yellow prussiate is\r\nmanufactured on a large scale, and is generally used as the source of\r\nthe other cyanogen compounds.\r\n\r\n  [41] It has an important historical interest, more especially as at\r\n       that time such an easy preparation of substances occurring in\r\n       organisms without the aid of organic life was quite unexpected,\r\n       for they were supposed to be formed under the influence of the\r\n       forces acting in organisms, and without the latter their formation\r\n       was considered impossible. And in addition to destroying this\r\n       illusion, the easy transition of NH_{4}OCN into CO(NH_{2})_{2} is\r\n       the best example of the passage of one system of equilibrium of\r\n       atoms into another more stable system.\r\n\r\n  [42] If ammonia and methane (marsh gas) do not show any acid\r\n       properties, that is in all probability due to the presence of a\r\n       large amount of hydrogen in both; but in hydrocyanic acid one atom\r\n       of hydrogen is under the influence of two acid-forming elements.\r\n       Acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, which contains but little hydrogen,\r\n       presents acid properties in certain respects, for its hydrogen is\r\n       easily replaced by metals. Hydronitrous acid, HN_{3}, which\r\n       contains little hydrogen, also has the properties of an acid.\r\n\r\n  [43] Solutions of cyanides--for instance, those of potassium or\r\n       barium--are decomposed by carbonic acid. Even the carbonic\r\n       anhydride of the air acts in a similar way, and for this reason\r\n       these solutions do not keep, because, in the first place, free\r\n       hydrocyanic acid itself decomposes and polymerises, and, in the\r\n       second place, with alkaline liquids it forms ammonia and formic\r\n       acid. Hydrocyanic acid does not liberate carbonic anhydride from\r\n       solutions of sodium or potassium carbonates. But a mixture of\r\n       solutions of potassium carbonate and hydrocyanic acid yields\r\n       carbonic anhydride on the addition of oxides like zinc oxide,\r\n       mercuric oxide, &c. This is due to the great inclination which the\r\n       cyanides exhibit of forming double salts. For instance,\r\n       ZnK_{2}(CN)_{4} is formed, which is a soluble double salt.\r\n\r\n  [43 bis] The conversion of the atmospheric nitrogen into cyanogen\r\n       compounds, although possible, has not yet been carried out on a\r\n       large scale, and one of the problems for future research should be\r\n       the discovery of a practical and economical means of converting\r\n       the atmospheric nitrogen into metallic cyanides, not only because\r\n       potassium cyanide has found a vast and important use for the\r\n       extraction of gold from even the poorest ores, but more especially\r\n       because the cyanides furnish the means for effecting the synthesis\r\n       of many complex carbon compounds, and the nitrogen contained in\r\n       cyanogen easily passes into other forms of combination such as\r\n       ammonia, which is of great importance in agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf four parts of yellow prussiate be mixed with eight parts of water and\r\nthree parts of sulphuric acid, and the mixture be heated, it decomposes,\r\nvolatile hydrocyanic acid separating. This was obtained for the first\r\ntime by Scheele in 1782, but it was only known to him in solution. In\r\n1809 Ittner prepared anhydrous prussic acid, and in 1815 Gay-Lussac\r\nfinally settled its properties and showed that it contains only hydrogen,\r\ncarbon, and nitrogen, CNH. If the distillate (a weak solution of HCN) be\r\nredistilled, and the first part collected, the anhydrous acid may be\r\nprepared from this stronger solution. In order to do this, pieces of\r\ncalcium chloride are added to the concentrated solution, when the\r\nanhydrous acid floats as a separate layer, because it is not soluble in\r\nan aqueous solution of calcium chloride. If this layer be then distilled\r\nover a new portion of calcium chloride at the lowest temperature\r\npossible, the prussic acid may be obtained completely free from water. It\r\nis, however, necessary to use the greatest caution in work of this kind,\r\nbecause prussic acid, besides being extremely poisonous, is exceedingly\r\nvolatile.[44]\r\n\r\n  [44] The mixture of the vapours of water and hydrocyanic acid, evolved\r\n       on heating yellow prussiate with sulphuric acid, may be passed\r\n       directly through vessels or tubes filled with calcium chloride.\r\n       These tubes must be cooled, because, in the first place,\r\n       hydrocyanic acid easily changes on being heated, and, in the\r\n       second place, the calcium chloride when warm would absorb less\r\n       water. The mixture of hydrocyanic acid and aqueous vapour on\r\n       passing over a long layer of calcium chloride gives up water, and\r\n       hydrocyanic acid alone remains in the vapour. It ought to be\r\n       cooled as carefully as possible in order to bring it into a liquid\r\n       condition. The method which Gay-Lussac employed for obtaining pure\r\n       hydrocyanic acid consisted in the action of hydrochloric acid gas\r\n       on mercuric cyanide. The latter may he obtained in a pure state if\r\n       a solution of yellow prussiate be boiled with a solution of\r\n       mercuric nitrate, filtered, and crystallised by cooling; the\r\n       mercuric cyanide is then obtained in the form of colourless\r\n       crystals, Hg(CN)_{2}.\r\n\r\n       If a strong solution of hydrochloric acid be poured upon these\r\n       crystals, and the mixture of vapours evolved, consisting of\r\n       aqueous vapour, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocyanic acid, be passed\r\n       through a tube containing, first, marble (for absorbing the\r\n       hydrochloric acid), and then lumps of calcium chloride, on cooling\r\n       the hydrocyanic acid will be condensed. In order to obtain the\r\n       latter in an anhydrous form, the decomposition of heated mercury\r\n       cyanide by hydrogen sulphide may be made use of. Here the sulphur\r\n       and cyanogen change places, and hydrocyanic acid and mercury\r\n       sulphide are formed: Hg(CN)_{2} + H_{2}S = 2HCN + HgS.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous prussic acid is a very mobile and volatile liquid; its specific\r\ngravity is 0·697 at 18°; at lower temperatures, especially when mixed\r\nwith a small quantity of water, it easily congeals; it boils at 26°, and\r\ntherefore very easily evaporates, and at ordinary temperatures may be\r\nregarded as a gas. An insignificant amount, when inhaled or brought into\r\ncontact with the skin, causes death. It is soluble in all proportions in\r\nwater, alcohol, and ether: weak aqueous solutions are used in\r\nmedicine.[45]\r\n\r\n  [45] A weak (up to 2 p.c.) aqueous solution of hydrocyanic acid is\r\n       obtained by the distillation of certain vegetable substances. The\r\n       so-called laurel water in particular enjoys considerable notoriety\r\n       from its containing hydrocyanic acid. It is obtained by the\r\n       steeping and distillation of laurel leaves. A similar kind of\r\n       water is formed by the infusion and distillation of bitter\r\n       almonds. It is well known that bitter almonds are poisonous, and\r\n       have a peculiar characteristic taste. This bitter taste is due to\r\n       the presence of a certain substance called amygdalin, which can be\r\n       extracted by alcohol. This amygdalin decomposes in an infusion of\r\n       bruised almonds, forming the so-called bitter almond oil, glucose,\r\n       and hydrocyanic acid:\r\n\r\n       C_{10}H_{27}NO_{11} + H_{2}O = C_{7}H_{6}O + CNH + 2C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\r\n          Amygdalin in        Water      Bitter Hydrocyanic    Glucose\r\n         bitter almonds                  almond    acid\r\n                                           oil\r\n\r\n       If after this the infusion of bitter almonds be distilled with\r\n       water, the hydrocyanic acid and the volatile bitter almond oil are\r\n       carried over with the aqueous vapour. The oil is insoluble in\r\n       water, or only sparingly soluble, while the hydrocyanic acid\r\n       remains as an aqueous solution. Bitter almond water is similar to\r\n       laurel water, and is used like the former in medicine, naturally\r\n       only in small quantities because any considerable amount has\r\n       poisonous effects. Perfectly pure anhydrous hydrocyanic acid keeps\r\n       without change, just like the weak solutions, but the strong\r\n       solutions only keep in the presence of other acids. In the\r\n       presence of many admixtures these solutions easily give a brown\r\n       polymeric substance, which is also formed in a solution of\r\n       potassium cyanide.\r\n\r\nThe salts MCN--for instance, potassium, sodium,\r\nammonium--as well as the salts M´´(CN)_{2}--for example, barium,\r\ncalcium, mercury--are soluble in water, but the cyanides of manganese,\r\nzinc, lead, and many others are insoluble in water. They form double\r\nsalts with potassium cyanide and similar metallic cyanides, an example\r\nof which we will consider in a further description of the yellow\r\nprussiate. Not only are some of the double salts remarkable for their\r\nconstancy and comparative stability, but so also are the soluble salt\r\nHgC_{2}N_{2}, the insoluble silver cyanide AgCN, and even potassium\r\ncyanide in the absence of water. The last salt,[46] when fused, acts\r\nas a reducing agent with its elements K and C, and oxidises when fused\r\nwith lead oxide, forming potassium cyanate, KOCN, which establishes the\r\nconnection between HCN and OHCN--that is, between the nitriles of formic\r\nand carbonic acids--and this connection is the same as that between\r\nthe acids themselves, since formic acid, on oxidation, yields carbonic\r\nacid. Free cyanogen, (CN)_{2} or CNCN, corresponds to hydrocyanic acid\r\nin the same manner as free chlorine, Cl_{2} or ClCl, corresponds to\r\nhydrochloric acid. This composition, judging from what has been already\r\nstated, exactly expresses that of the nitrile of oxalic acid, and, as\r\na matter of fact, oxalate of ammonia and the amide corresponding with\r\nit (oxamide, Note 33), on being heated with phosphoric anhydride, which\r\ntakes up the water, yield _cyanogen_, (CN)_{2}. This substance is also\r\nproduced by simply heating some of the metallic cyanides. Mercuric\r\ncyanide is particularly adapted for this purpose, because it is easily\r\nobtained in a pure state and is then very stable. If mercuric cyanide be\r\nheated, it decomposes, in like manner to mercury oxide, into metallic\r\nmercury and cyanogen: HgC_{2}N_{2} = Hg + C_{2}N_{2}.[47] When cyanogen\r\nis formed, part of it always polymerises into a dark brown insoluble\r\nsubstance called _paracyanogen_, capable of forming cyanogen when\r\nheated to redness.[48] Cyanogen is a colourless, poisonous gas, with a\r\npeculiar smell and easily condensed by cooling into a colourless liquid,\r\ninsoluble in water and having a specific gravity of 0·86. It boils at\r\nabout -21°, and therefore cyanogen may be easily condensed into a liquid\r\nby a strong freezing mixture. At -35° liquid cyanogen solidifies. The gas\r\nis soluble in water and in alcohol to a considerable extent--namely,\r\n1 volume of water absorbs as much as 4-1/2 volumes, and alcohol 23\r\nvolumes. Cyanogen resists the action of a tolerably high temperature\r\nwithout decomposing, but under the action of the electric spark the\r\ncarbon is separated, leaving a volume of nitrogen equal to the volume\r\nof the gas taken. As it contains carbon it burns, and the colour of the\r\nflame is reddish-violet, which is due to the presence of nitrogen, all\r\ncompounds of which impart more or less of this reddish-violet hue to\r\nthe flame. During the combustion of cyanogen, carbonic anhydride and\r\nnitrogen are formed. The same products are obtained in the eudiometer\r\nwith oxygen or by the action of cyanogen on many oxides at a red heat.\r\n\r\n  [46] This salt will be described in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n  [47] For the preparation it is necessary to take completely dry mercuric\r\n       cyanide, because when heated in the presence of moisture it gives\r\n       ammonia, carbonic anhydride, and hydrocyanic acid. Instead of\r\n       mercuric cyanide, a mixture of perfectly dry yellow prussiate and\r\n       mercuric chloride may be used, then double decomposition and the\r\n       formation of mercuric cyanide take place in the retort. Silver\r\n       cyanide also disengages cyanogen, on being heated.\r\n\r\n  [47] _Paracyanogen_ is a brown substance (having the composition of\r\n       cyanogen) which is formed during the preparation of cyanogen by\r\n       all methods, and remains as a residue. Silver cyanide, on being\r\n       slightly heated, fuses, and on being further heated evolves a gas;\r\n       a considerable quantity of paracyanogen remains in the residue.\r\n       Here it is remarkable that exactly half the cyanogen becomes\r\n       gaseous, and the other half is transformed into paracyanogen.\r\n       Metallic silver will be found in the residue with the\r\n       paracyanogen; it may be extracted with mercury or nitric acid,\r\n       which does not act on paracyanogen. If paracyanogen be heated in a\r\n       vacuum it decomposes, forming cyanogen; but here the pressure _p_\r\n       for a given temperature _t_ cannot exceed a certain limit, so that\r\n       the phenomenon presents all the external appearance of a physical\r\n       transformation into vapour; but, nevertheless, it is a complete\r\n       change in the nature of the substance, though limited by the\r\n       _pressure of dissociation_, as we saw before in the transformation\r\n       of cyanuric into hydrocyanic acid, and as would be expected from\r\n       the fundamental principles of dissociation. Troost and\r\n       Hautefeuille (1868) found that for paracyanogen,\r\n\r\n                    _t_ = 530°  581°  600°    635°\r\n                    _p_ =  90   143   296   1,089 mm.\r\n\r\n       However, even at 550° part of the cyanogen decomposes into carbon\r\n       and nitrogen. The reverse transition of cyanogen into paracyanogen\r\n       commences at 350°, and at 600° proceeds rapidly. And if the\r\n       transition of the first kind is likened to evaporation, then the\r\n       reverse transition, or polymerisation, presents a likeness to the\r\n       transition of vapours into the solid state.\r\n\r\nThe relation of cyanogen to the metallic cyanides is seen not only in the\r\nfact that it is formed from mercuric cyanide, but also by its forming\r\ncyanide of sodium or potassium on being heated with either of those\r\nmetals, the sodium or potassium taking fire in the cyanogen. On heating a\r\nmixture of hydrogen and cyanogen to 500° (Berthelot),[49] or under the\r\naction of the silent discharge (Boilleau), hydrocyanic acid is formed, so\r\nthat the reciprocity of the transitions does not leave any doubt in the\r\nmatter that all the nitriles of the organic acids contain cyanogen, just\r\nas all the organic acids contain carboxyl and in it the elements of\r\ncarbonic anhydride. Besides the amides,[50] the nitriles (or cyanogen\r\ncompounds, RCN), and nitro-compounds (containing the radicle of nitric\r\nacid, RNO_{2}), there are a great number of other substances containing\r\nat the same time carbon and nitrogen, particulars of which must be sought\r\nfor in special works on organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [49] Cyanogen (like chlorine) is absorbed by a solution of sodium\r\n       hydroxide, sodium cyanide and cyanate being produced: C_{2}N_{2} +\r\n       2NaHO = NaCN + CNNaO + H_{2}O. But the latter salt decomposes\r\n       relatively easily, and moreover part of the cyanogen liberated by\r\n       heat from its compounds undergoes a more complex transformation.\r\n\r\n  [50] If, in general, compounds containing the radicle NH_{2} are called\r\n       amides, some of the _amines_ ought to be ranked with them; namely,\r\n       the hydrocarbons C_{_n_}H_{2_m_}, in which part of the hydrogen is\r\n       replaced by NH_{2}; for instance, methylamine, CH_{3}NH_{2},\r\n       aniline, C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}, &c. In general the amines may be\r\n       represented as ammonia in which part or all of the hydrogen is\r\n       replaced by hydrocarbon radicles--as, for example, trimethylamine,\r\n       N(CH_{3})_{3}. They, like ammonia, combine with acids and form\r\n       crystalline salts. Analogous substances are sometimes met with in\r\n       nature, and bear the general name of _alkaloids_; such are, for\r\n       instance, quinine in cinchona bark, nicotine in tobacco, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n          SODIUM CHLORIDE--BERTHOLLET'S LAWS--HYDROCHLORIC ACID\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have become acquainted with the most\r\nimportant properties of the four elements, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nand carbon.

No compounds of one atom of oxygen with\r\nthree or four atoms of hydrogen are known; hence the atom of oxygen does\r\nnot possess certain properties which are found in the atoms of carbon\r\nand nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of an element to form a compound of definite composition\r\nwith hydrogen (or an element analogous to it) gives the possibility\r\nof foretelling the composition of many other of its compounds. Thus,\r\nif we know that an element, M, combines with hydrogen, forming, by\r\npreference, a gaseous substance such as HM, but not forming H_{2}M,\r\nH_{3}M, H_{n}M_{m}, then we must conclude, on the basis of the law of\r\nsubstitution, that this element will give compounds M_{2}O, M_{3}N,\r\nMHO, MH_{3}C, &c. Chlorine is an example of this kind. If we know\r\nthat another element, R, like oxygen, gives with hydrogen a molecule\r\nH_{2}R, then we may expect that it will form compounds similar to\r\nhydrogen peroxide, the metallic oxides, carbonic anhydride, or carbonic\r\noxide, and others. Sulphur is an instance of this kind. Hence the\r\nelements may be classified according to their resemblance to hydrogen,\r\noxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, and in conformity with this analogy it\r\nis possible to foretell, if not the properties (for example, the\r\nacidity or basicity), at any rate the composition,[1] of some of their\r\ncompounds. This forms the substance of _the conception of the valency\r\nor atomicity of the elements_. Hydrogen is taken as the representative\r\nof the univalent elements, giving compounds, RH, R(OH), R_{2}O, RCl,\r\nR_{3}N, R_{4}C, &c. Oxygen, in that form in which it gives water, is the\r\nrepresentative of the bivalent elements, forming RH_{2}, RO, RCl_{2},\r\nRHCl, R(OH)Cl, R(OH)_{2}, R_{2}C, RCN, &c. Nitrogen in ammonia is the\r\nrepresentative of the trivalent elements, giving compounds RH_{3},\r\nR_{2}O_{3}, R(OH)_{3}, RCl_{3}, RN, RHC, &c. In carbon are exemplified\r\nthe properties of the quadrivalent elements, forming RH_{4}, RO_{2},\r\nRO(OH)_{2}, R(OH)_{4}, RHN, RCl_{4}, RHCl_{3}, &c. We meet with these\r\n_forms of combination_, or degrees of union of atoms, in all other\r\nelements, some being analogous to hydrogen, others to oxygen, and others\r\nto nitrogen or to carbon. But besides these quantitative analogies or\r\nresemblances, which are foretold by the law of substitution (Chapter\r\nVI.), there exist among the elements qualitative analogies and relations\r\nwhich are not fully seen in the compounds of the elements which have\r\nbeen considered, but are most distinctly exhibited in the formation of\r\nbases, acids, and salts of different types and properties. Therefore,\r\nfor a complete study of the nature of the elements and their compounds\r\nit is especially important to become acquainted with the salts, as\r\nsubstances of a peculiar character, and with the corresponding acids and\r\nbases. Common table salt, or sodium chloride, NaCl, may in every respect\r\nbe taken as a type of salts in general, and we will therefore pass to\r\nthe consideration of this substance, and of hydrochloric acid, and of\r\nthe base sodium hydroxide, formed by the non-metal chlorine and the\r\nmetal sodium, which correspond with it.\r\n\r\n  [1] But it is impossible to foretell all the compounds formed by an\r\n      element from its atomicity or valency, because the atomicity of the\r\n      elements is variable, and furthermore this variability is not\r\n      identical for different elements. In CO_{2}, COX_{2}, CH_{4}, and\r\n      the multitude of carbon compounds corresponding with them, the C is\r\n      quadrivalent, but in CO either the carbon must be taken as bivalent\r\n      or the atomicity of oxygen be accounted as variable. Moreover,\r\n      carbon is an example of an element which preserves its atomicity to\r\n      a greater degree than most of the other elements. Nitrogen in\r\n      NH_{3}, NH_{2}(OH), N_{2}O_{3}, and even in CNH, must be considered\r\n      as trivalent, but in NH_{4}Cl, NO_{2}(OH), and in all their\r\n      corresponding compounds it is necessarily pentavalent. In N_{2}O,\r\n      if the atomicity of oxygen = 2, nitrogen has an uneven atomicity\r\n      (1, 3, 5), whilst in NO it is bivalent. If sulphur be bivalent,\r\n      like oxygen, in many of its compounds (for example, H_{2}S,\r\n      SCl_{2}, KHS, &c.), then it could not be foreseen from this that it\r\n      would form SO_{2}, SO_{3}, SCl_{4}, SOCl_{2}, and a series of\r\n      similar compounds in which its atomicity must be acknowledged as\r\n      greater than 2. Thus SO_{2}, sulphurous anhydride, has many points\r\n      in common with CO_{2}, and if carbon be quadrivalent then the S in\r\n      SO_{2} is quadrivalent. Therefore the principle of atomicity\r\n      (valency) of the elements cannot be considered established as the\r\n      basis for the study of the elements, although it gives an easy\r\n      method of grasping many analogies. I consider the four following as\r\n      the chief obstacles to acknowledging the atomicity of the elements\r\n      as a primary conception for the consideration of the properties of\r\n      the elements: 1. Such univalent elements as H, Cl, &c., appear in a\r\n      free state as molecules H_{2}, Cl_{2}, &c., and are consequently\r\n      like the univalent radicles CH_{3}, OH, CO_{2}H, &c., which, as\r\n      might be expected, appear as C_{2}H_{6}, O_{2}H_{2},\r\n      C_{2}O_{4}H_{2} (ethane, hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid), whilst on\r\n      the other hand, potassium and sodium (perhaps also iodine at a high\r\n      temperature) contain only one atom, K, Na, in the molecule in a\r\n      free state. Hence it follows that _free affinities_ may exist.\r\n      Granting this, nothing prevents the assumption that free affinities\r\n      exist in all unsaturated compounds; for example, two free\r\n      affinities in NH_{3}. If such instances of free affinities be\r\n      admitted, then all the possible advantages to be gained by the\r\n      application of the doctrine of atomicity (valency) are lost. 2.\r\n      There are instances--for example, Na_{2}H--where univalent elements\r\n      are combined in molecules which are more complex than R_{2}, and\r\n      form molecules, R_{3}, R_{4}, &c.; this may again be either taken\r\n      as evidence of the existence of free affinities, or else\r\n      necessitates such primary univalent elements as sodium and hydrogen\r\n      being considered as variable in their atomicity. 3. The periodic\r\n      system of the elements, with which we shall afterwards become\r\n      acquainted, shows that there is a law or rule for the variation of\r\n      the forms of oxygen and hydrogen compounds; chlorine is univalent\r\n      with respect to hydrogen, and septavalent with respect to oxygen;\r\n      sulphur is bivalent to hydrogen, and sexavalent to oxygen;\r\n      phosphorus is trivalent to hydrogen and pentavalent in respect to\r\n      oxygen--the sum is in every case equal to 8. Only carbon and its\r\n      analogues (for example, silicon) are quadrivalent to both hydrogen\r\n      and oxygen. Hence the power of the elements to change their\r\n      atomicity is an essential part of their nature, and therefore\r\n      constant valency cannot he considered as a fundamental property. 4.\r\n      Crystallo-hydrates (for instance, NaCl,2H_{2}O, or NaBr,2H_{2}O),\r\n      double salts (such as PtCl_{4},2KCl,H_{2}SiF_{6}, &c.), and similar\r\n      complex compounds (and, according to Chap. I., solutions also)\r\n      demonstrate the capacity not only of the elements themselves, but\r\n      also of their saturated and limiting compounds, of entering into\r\n      further combination. Therefore the admission of a definite limited\r\n      atomicity of the elements includes in itself an admission of\r\n      limitation which is not in accordance with the nature of chemical\r\n      reactions.\r\n\r\n_Sodium chloride_, NaCl, the familiar table salt, occurs, although in\r\nvery small quantities, in all the primary formations of the earth's\r\ncrust,[2] from which it is washed away by the atmospheric waters; it is\r\ncontained in small quantities in all waters flowing through these\r\nformations, and is in this manner conveyed to the oceans and seas. The\r\nimmense mass of salt in the oceans has been accumulated by this process\r\nfrom the remote ages of the earth's creation, because the water has\r\nevaporated from them while the salt has remained in solution. The salt of\r\nsea water serves as the source not only for its direct extraction, but\r\nalso for the formation of other masses of workable salt, such as rock\r\nsalt, and of saline springs and lakes.[2 bis]\r\n\r\n  [2] The primary formations are those which do not bear any distinct\r\n      traces of having been deposited from water (have not a stratified\r\n      formation and contain no remains of animal or vegetable life),\r\n      occur under the sedimentary formations of the earth, and are\r\n      everywhere uniform in composition and structure, the latter being\r\n      generally distinctly crystalline. If it be assumed that the earth\r\n      was originally in a molten condition, the first primary formations\r\n      are those which formed the first solid crust of the earth. But even\r\n      with this hypothesis of the earth's origin, it is necessary to\r\n      admit that the first aqueous deposits must have caused a change in\r\n      the original crust of the earth, and therefore under the head of\r\n      primary formations must be understood the most ancient of the\r\n      products of decomposition (mostly by atmospheric, aqueous, and\r\n      organic agency, &c.), from which all the rocks and substances of\r\n      the earth's surface have arisen. In speaking of the origin of one\r\n      or another substance, we can only, on the basis of facts, descend\r\n      to the primary formations, of which granite, gneiss, and trachyte\r\n      may be taken as examples.\r\n\r\n  [2 bis] Chloride of sodium has been found to occur in the atmosphere in\r\n      the form of a fine dust; in the lower strata it is present in\r\n      larger quantities than in the upper, so that the rain water falling\r\n      on mountains contains less NaCl than that falling in valleys. Müntz\r\n      (1891) found that a litre of rain water collected on the summit of\r\n      the Pic du Midi (2,877 metres above the sea level) contained 0·34\r\n      milligram of chloride of sodium, while a litre of rain collected\r\n      from the valley contained 2·5-7·6 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of salt _from sea water_ is carried on in several ways. In\r\nsouthern climes, especially on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the\r\nMediterranean and Black Seas, the summer heats are taken advantage of. A\r\nconvenient low-lying sea shore is chosen, and a whole series of basins,\r\ncommunicating with each other, are constructed along it. The upper of\r\nthese basins are filled with sea water by pumping, or else advantage is\r\ntaken of high tides. These basins are sometimes separated from the sea by\r\nnatural sand-banks (limans) or by artificial means, and in spring the\r\nwater already begins to evaporate considerably. As the solution becomes\r\nmore concentrated, it is run into the succeeding basins, and the upper\r\nones are supplied with a fresh quantity of sea water, or else an\r\narrangement is made enabling the salt water to flow by degrees through\r\nthe series of basins. It is evident that the beds of the basins should be\r\nas far as possible impervious to water, and for this purpose they are\r\nmade of beaten clay. The crystals of salt begin to separate out when the\r\nconcentration attains 28 p.c. of salt (which corresponds to 28° of\r\nBaumé's hydrometer). They are raked off, and employed for all those\r\npurposes to which table salt is applicable. In the majority of cases only\r\nthe first half of the sodium chloride which can be separated from the sea\r\nwater is extracted, because the second half has a bitter taste from the\r\npresence of magnesium salts which separate out together with the sodium\r\nsalt. But in certain localities--as, for instance, in the estuary of the\r\nRhone, on the island of Camarga[3]--the evaporation is carried on to the\r\nvery end, in order to obtain those magnesium and potassium salts which\r\nseparate out at the end of the evaporation of sea water. Various salts\r\nare separated from sea water in its evaporation. From 100 parts of sea\r\nwater there separates out, by natural and artificial evaporation, about\r\none part of tolerably pure table salt at the very commencement of the\r\noperation; the total amount held in solution being about 2-1/2 p.c. The\r\nremaining portion separates out intermixed with the bitter salts of\r\nmagnesium which, owing to their solubility and the small amount in which\r\nthey are present (less than 1 p.c.), only separate out, in the first\r\ncrystallisations, in traces. Gypsum, or calcium sulphate,\r\nCaSO_{4},2H_{2}O, because of its sparing solubility, separates together\r\nwith or even before the table salt. When about half of the latter has\r\nseparated, then a mixture of table salt and magnesium sulphate separates\r\nout, and on still further evaporation the chlorides of potassium and\r\nmagnesium begin to separate in a state of combination, forming the double\r\nsalt KMgCl_{3},6H_{2}O, which occurs in nature as _carnallite_.[4] After\r\nthe separation of this salt from sea water, there remains a mother liquor\r\ncontaining a large amount of magnesium chloride in admixture with various\r\nother salts.[5] The extraction of sea salt is usually carried on for the\r\npurpose of procuring table salt, and therefore directly it begins to\r\nseparate mixed with a considerable proportion[6] of magnesium salts (when\r\nit acquires a bitter taste) the remaining liquor is run back into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n  [3] The extraction of the potassium salts (or so-called summer salts)\r\n      was carried on at the Isle of Camarga about 1870, when I had\r\n      occasion to visit that spot. At the present time the deposits of\r\n      Stassfurt provide a much cheaper salt, owing to the evaporation and\r\n      separation of the salt being carried on there by natural means and\r\n      only requiring a treatment and refining, which is also necessary in\r\n      addition for the 'summer salt' obtained from sea-water.\r\n\r\n  [4] The double salt KCl,MgCl_{2} is a crystallohydrate of KCl and\r\n      MgCl_{2}, and is only formed from solutions containing an excess of\r\n      magnesium chloride, because water decomposes this double salt,\r\n      extracting the more soluble magnesium chloride from it.\r\n\r\n  [5] Owing to the fundamental property of salts of interchanging their\r\n      metals, it cannot be said that sea water contains this or that\r\n      salt, but only that it contains certain amounts of certain metals M\r\n      (univalent like Na and K, and bivalent like Mg and Ca), and haloids\r\n      X (univalent like Cl, Br, and bivalent like SO_{4}, CO_{3}), which\r\n      are disposed in every possible kind of grouping; for instance, K as\r\n      KCl, KBr, K_{2}SO_{4}, Mg as MgCl_{2}, MgBr_{2}, MgSO_{4}, and so\r\n      on for all the other metals. In evaporation different salts\r\n      separate out consecutively only because they reach saturation. A\r\n      proof of this may be seen in the fact that a solution of a mixture\r\n      of sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate (both of which salts are\r\n      obtained from sea water, as was mentioned above), when evaporated,\r\n      deposits crystals of these salts, but when refrigerated (if the\r\n      solution be sufficiently saturated) the salt Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O\r\n      is first deposited because it is the first to arrive at saturation\r\n      at low temperatures. Consequently this solution contains MgCl_{2}\r\n      and Na_{2}SO_{4}, besides MgSO_{4} and NaCl. So it is with sea\r\n      water.\r\n\r\n  [6] The salt extracted from water is piled up in heaps and left exposed\r\n      to the action of rain water, which purifies it, owing to the water\r\n      becoming saturated with sodium chloride and then no longer\r\n      dissolving it, but washing out the impurities.\r\n\r\nThe same process which is employed for artificially obtaining salt in a\r\ncrystalline form from sea water has been repeatedly accomplished during\r\nthe geological evolution of the earth on a gigantic scale; upheavals of\r\nthe earth have cut off portions of the sea from the remainder (as the\r\nDead Sea was formerly a part of the Mediterranean, and the Sea of Aral of\r\nthe Caspian), and their water has evaporated and formed (if the mass of\r\nthe inflowing fresh water were less than that of the mass evaporated)\r\ndeposits of _rock salt_. It is always accompanied by gypsum, because the\r\nlatter is separated from sea water with or before the sodium chloride.\r\nFor this reason rock salt may always be looked for in those localities\r\nwhere there are deposits of gypsum. But inasmuch as the gypsum remains on\r\nthe spot where it has been deposited (as it is a sparingly soluble salt),\r\nwhilst the rock salt (as one which is very soluble) may be washed away by\r\nrain or fresh running water, it may sometimes happen that although gypsum\r\nis still found there may be no salt; but, on the other hand, where there\r\nis rock salt there will always be gypsum. As the geological changes of\r\nthe earth's surface are still proceeding at the present day, so in the\r\nmidst of the dry land salt lakes are met with, which are sometimes\r\nscattered over vast districts formerly covered by seas now dried up. Such\r\nis the origin of many of the salt lakes about the lower portions of the\r\nVolga and in the Kirghiz steppes, where at a geological epoch preceding\r\nthe present the Aralo-Caspian Sea extended. Such are the Baskunchaksky\r\n(in the Government of Astrakhan, 112 square kilometres superficial area),\r\nthe Eltonsky (140 versts from the left bank of the Volga, and 200 square\r\nkilometres in superficial area), and upward of 700 other salt lakes lying\r\nabout the lower portions of the Volga. In those in which the inflow of\r\nfresh water is less than that yearly evaporated, and in which the\r\nconcentration of the solution has reached saturation, the\r\n_self-deposited_ salt is found already deposited on their beds, or is\r\nbeing yearly deposited during the summer months. Certain limans, or\r\nsea-side lakes, of the Azoff Sea are essentially of the same\r\ncharacter--as, for instance, those in the neighbourhood of Henichesk and\r\nBerdiansk. The saline soils of certain Central Asian steppes, which\r\nsuffer from a want of atmospheric fresh water, are of the same origin.\r\nTheir salt originally proceeded from the salt of seas which previously\r\ncovered these localities, and has not yet been washed away by fresh\r\nwater. The main result of the above-described process of nature is the\r\nformation of masses of rock salt, which are, however, being gradually\r\nwashed away by the subsoil waters flowing in their neighbourhood, and\r\nafterwards rising to the surface in certain places as _saline springs_,\r\nwhich indicate the presence of masses of deposited rock salt in the\r\ndepths of the earth. If the subsoil water flows along a stratum of salt\r\nfor a sufficient length of time it becomes saturated; but in flowing in\r\nits further course along an impervious stratum (clay) it becomes diluted\r\nby the fresh water leaking through the upper soil, and therefore the\r\ngreater the distance of a saline spring from the deposit of rock salt,\r\nthe poorer will it be in salt. A perfectly saturated brine, however, may\r\nbe procured from the depths of the earth by means of bore-holes. The\r\ndeposits of rock salt themselves, which are sometimes hidden at great\r\ndepths below the earth's strata, may be discovered by the guidance of\r\nbore-holes and the direction of the strata of the district. Deposits of\r\nrock salt, about 35 metres thick and 20 metres below the surface, were\r\ndiscovered in this manner in the neighbourhood of Brianstcheffky and\r\nDekonoffky, in the Bakhmut district of the Government of Ekaterinoslav.\r\nLarge quantities of most excellent rock salt are now (since 1880)\r\nobtained from these deposits, whose presence was indicated by the\r\nneighbouring salt springs (near Slaviansk and Bakhmut) and by bore-holes\r\nwhich had been sunk in these localities for procuring strong (saturated)\r\nbrines. But the Stassfurt deposits of rock salt near Magdeburg in Germany\r\nare celebrated as being the first discovered in this manner, and for\r\ntheir many remarkable peculiarities.[7] The plentiful distribution of\r\nsaline springs in this and the neighbouring districts suggested the\r\npresence of deposits of rock salt in the vicinity. Deep bore-holes sunk\r\nin this locality did in fact give a richer brine--even quite saturated\r\nwith salt. On sinking to a still greater depth, the deposits of salt\r\nthemselves were at last arrived at. But the first deposit which was met\r\nwith consisted of a bitter salt unfit for consumption, and was therefore\r\ncalled refuse salt (_Abraumsalz_). On sinking still deeper vast beds of\r\nreal rock salt were struck. In this instance the presence of these upper\r\nstrata containing salts of potassium, magnesium, and sodium is an\r\nexcellent proof of the formation of rock salt from sea water. It is very\r\nevident that not only a case of evaporation to the end--as far, for\r\ninstance, as the separation of carnallite--but also the preservation of\r\nsuch soluble salts as separate out from sea water after the sodium\r\nchloride, must be a very exceptional phenomenon, which is not repeated in\r\nall deposits of rock salt. The Stassfurt deposits therefore are of\r\nparticular interest, not only from a scientific point of view, but also\r\nbecause they form a rich source of potassium salts which have many\r\npractical uses.[7 bis]\r\n\r\n  [7] When the German savants pointed out the exact locality of the\r\n      Stassfurt salt-beds and their depth below the surface, on the basis\r\n      of information collected from various quarters respecting\r\n      bore-holes and the direction of the strata, and when the borings,\r\n      conducted by the Government, struck a salt-bed which was bitter and\r\n      unfit for use, there was a great outcry against science, and the\r\n      doubtful result even caused the cessation of the further work of\r\n      deepening the shafts. It required a great effort to persuade the\r\n      Government to continue the work. Now, when the pure salt\r\n      encountered below forms one of the important riches of Germany, and\r\n      when those 'refuse salts' have proved to be most valuable (as a\r\n      source of potassium and magnesium), we should see in the\r\n      utilisation of the Stassfurt deposits one of the conquests of\r\n      science for the common welfare.\r\n\r\n  [7 bis] In Western Europe, deposits of rock salt have long been known\r\n      at Wieliczka, near Cracow, and at Cardona in Spain. In Russia the\r\n      following deposits are known: (_a_) the vast masses of rock salt (3\r\n      square kilometres area and up to 140 metres thick) lying directly\r\n      on the surface of the earth at Iletzky Zastchit, on the left bank\r\n      of the river Ural, in the Government of Orenburg; (_b_) the\r\n      Chingaksky deposit, 90 versts from the river Volga, in the\r\n      Enotaeffsky district of the Government of Astrakhan; (_c_) the\r\n      Kulepinsky (and other) deposits (whose thickness attains 150\r\n      metres), on the Araks, in the Government of Erivan in the Caucasus;\r\n      (_d_) the Katchiezmansky deposit in the province of Kars; (_e_) the\r\n      Krasnovodsky deposit in the Trans-Caspian province; and (_f_) the\r\n      Bardymkulsky salt mines in Kokhand.\r\n\r\nA saturated brine, formed by the continued contact of subsoil water with\r\nrock salt, is extracted by means of bore-holes, as, for instance, in the\r\nGovernments of Perm, Kharkoff, and Ekaterinoslav. Sometimes, as at\r\nBerchtesgaden (and at Hallein) in Austria, spring water is run on to\r\nunderground beds of rock salt containing much clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Graduator for the evaporation of the water of\r\nsaline springs.]\r\n\r\nIf a saline spring, or the salt water pumped from bore-holes, contains\r\nbut little salt, then the first concentration of the natural solution\r\nis not carried on by the costly consumption of fuel, but by the cheaper\r\nmethod of evaporation by means of the wind. For this purpose so-called\r\ngraduators are constructed: they consist of long and lofty sheds,\r\nwhich are sometimes several versts long, and generally extend in a\r\ndirection at right angles to that of the usual course of the wind in\r\nthe district. These sheds are open at the sides, and are filled with\r\nbrushwood as shown in fig. 64. Troughs, A B, C D, into which the salt\r\nwater is pumped, run along the top. On flowing from these troughs,\r\nthrough the openings, _a_, the water spreads over the brushwood and\r\ndistributes itself in a thin layer over it, so that it presents a very\r\nlarge surface for evaporation, in consequence of which it rapidly\r\nbecomes concentrated in warm or windy weather. After trickling over the\r\nbrushwood, the solution collects in a reservoir under the graduator,\r\nwhence it is usually pumped up by the pumps P P´, and again run a\r\nsecond and third time through the graduator, until the solution reaches\r\na degree of concentration at which it becomes profitable to extract\r\nthe salt by direct heating. Generally the evaporation in the graduator\r\nis not carried beyond a concentration of 12 to 15 parts of salt in\r\n100 parts of solution. Strong natural solutions of salt, and also the\r\ngraduated solutions, are evaporated in large shallow metallic vessels,\r\nwhich are either heated by the direct action of the flame from below\r\nor from above. These vessels are made of boiler plate, and are called\r\nsalt-pans. Various means are employed for accelerating the evaporation\r\nand for economising fuel, which are mainly based on an artificial\r\ndraught to carry off the steam as it is formed, and on subjecting the\r\nsaline solution to a preliminary heating by the waste heat of the\r\nsteam and furnace gases. Furthermore, the first portions of the salt\r\nwhich crystallise out in the salt-pans are invariably contaminated\r\nwith gypsum, since the waters of saline springs always contain this\r\nsubstance. It is only the portions of the salt which separate later that\r\nare distinguished by their great purity. The salt is ladled out as it is\r\ndeposited, left to drain on inclined tables and then dried, and in this\r\nmanner the so-called bay salt is obtained. Since it has become possible\r\nto discover the saline deposits themselves, the extraction of table salt\r\nfrom the water of saline springs by evaporation, which previously was\r\nin general use, has begun to be disused, and is only able to hold its\r\nground in places where fuel is cheap.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the full importance of the extraction of salt,\r\nit need only be mentioned that on the average 20 lbs. of table salt are\r\nconsumed yearly per head of population, directly in food or for cattle.\r\nIn those countries where common salt is employed in technical processes,\r\nand especially in England, almost an equal quantity is consumed in the\r\nproduction of substances containing chlorine and sodium, and especially\r\nin the manufacture of washing soda, &c., and of chlorine compounds\r\n(bleaching powder and hydrochloric acid). The yearly production of salt\r\nin Europe amounts to as much as 7-1/2 million tons.\r\n\r\nAlthough certain lumps of rock salt and crystals of bay salt sometimes\r\nconsist of almost pure sodium chloride, still the ordinary commercial\r\nsalt contains various impurities, the most common of which are\r\nmagnesium salts. If the salt be pure, its solution gives no precipitate\r\nwith sodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, showing the absence of magnesium\r\nsalts, because magnesium carbonate, MgCO_{3}, is insoluble in water.\r\nRock salt, which is ground for use, generally contains also a\r\nconsiderable admixture of clay and other insoluble impurities.[8] For\r\nordinary use the bulk of the salt obtained can be employed directly\r\nwithout further purification; but some salts are purified by solution\r\nand crystallisation of the solution after standing, in which case the\r\nevaporation is not carried on to dryness, and the impurities remain\r\nin the _mother liquor_ or in the sediment. When perfectly pure salt\r\nis required for chemical purposes it is best obtained as follows: a\r\nsaturated solution of table salt is prepared, and hydrochloric acid\r\ngas is passed through it; this precipitates the sodium chloride (which\r\nis not soluble in a strong solution of hydrochloric acid), while the\r\nimpurities remain in solution. By repeating the operation and fusing\r\nthe salt (when adhering hydrochloric acid is volatilised) a pure\r\nsalt is obtained, which is again crystallised from its solution by\r\nevaporation.[9]\r\n\r\n  [8] The fracture of rock salt generally shows the presence of\r\n      interlayers of impurities which are sometimes very small in weight,\r\n      but visible owing to their refraction. In the excellently laid out\r\n      salt mines of Briansk I counted (1888), if my memory does not\r\n      deceive me, on an average ten interlayers per metre of thickness,\r\n      between which the salt was in general very pure, and in places\r\n      quite transparent. If this be the case, then there would be 350\r\n      interlayers for the whole thickness (about 35 metres) of the bed.\r\n      They probably correspond with the yearly deposition of the salt. In\r\n      this case the deposition would have extended over more than 300\r\n      years. This should be observable at the present day in lakes where\r\n      the salt is saturated and in course of deposition.\r\n\r\n  [9] My own investigations have shown that not only the sulphates, but\r\n      also the potassium salts, are entirely removed by this method.\r\n\r\nPure sodium chloride, in well-defined crystals (slowly deposited at the\r\nbottom of the liquid) or in compact masses (in which form rock salt is\r\nsometimes met with), is a colourless and transparent substance\r\nresembling, but more brittle and less hard than, glass.[10] Common salt\r\nalways crystallises in the cubic system, most frequently in _cubes_, and\r\nmore rarely in octahedra. Large transparent cubes of common salt, having\r\nedges up to 10 centimetres long, are sometimes found in masses of rock\r\nsalt.[11] When evaporated in the open the salt often separates out on\r\nthe surface[12] as cubes, which grow on to each other in the form of\r\npyramidal square funnels. In still weather, these clusters are able to\r\nsupport themselves on the surface of the water for a long time, and\r\nsometimes go on increasing to a considerable extent, but they sink\r\ndirectly the water penetrates inside them. Salt fuses to a colourless\r\nliquid (sp. gr. 1·602, according to Quincke) at 851° (V. Meyer); if pure\r\nit solidifies to a non-crystalline mass, and if impure to an opaque mass\r\nwhose surface is not smooth. In fusing, sodium chloride commences to\r\nvolatilise (its weight decreases) and at a white heat it volatilises with\r\ngreat ease and completely; but at the ordinary temperature it may, like\r\nall ordinary salts, be considered as non-volatile, although as yet no\r\nexact experiments have been made in this direction.\r\n\r\n  [10] According to the determinations of Klodt, the Briansk rock salt\r\n       withstands a pressure of 340 kilograms per square centimetre,\r\n       whilst glass withstands 1,700 kilos. In this respect salt is twice\r\n       as secure as bricks, and therefore immense masses may be extracted\r\n       from underground workings with perfect safety, without having\r\n       recourse to brickwork supports, merely taking advantage of the\r\n       properties of the salt itself.\r\n\r\n  [11] To obtain well-formed crystals, a saturated solution is mixed with\r\n       ferric chloride, several small crystals of sodium chloride are\r\n       placed at the bottom, and the solution is allowed to evaporate\r\n       slowly in a vessel with a loose-fitting cover. Octahedral crystals\r\n       are obtained by the addition of borax, urea, &c., to the solution.\r\n       Very fine crystals are formed in a mass of gelatinous silica.\r\n\r\n  [12] If a solution of sodium chloride be slowly heated from above,\r\n       where the evaporation takes place, then the upper layer will\r\n       become saturated before the lower and cooler layers, and therefore\r\n       crystallisation will begin on the surface, and the crystals first\r\n       formed will float, having also dried from above, on the surface\r\n       until they become quite soaked. Being heavier than the solution\r\n       the crystals are partially immersed under it, and the following\r\n       crystallisation, also proceeding on the surface, will only form\r\n       crystals along the side of the original crystals. A funnel is\r\n       formed in this manner. It will be borne on the surface like a boat\r\n       (if the liquid be quiescent), because it will grow more from the\r\n       upper edges. We can thus understand this at first sight strange\r\n       funnel form of crystallisation of salt. In explanation why the\r\n       crystallisation under the above conditions begins at the surface\r\n       and not at the lower layers, it must be mentioned that the\r\n       specific gravity of a crystal of sodium chloride = 2·16, and that\r\n       of a solution saturated at 25° contains 26·7 p.c. of salt and has\r\n       a specific gravity at 25°/4° of 1·2004; at 15° a saturated\r\n       solution contains 26·5 p.c. of salt and has a sp. gr. 1·203 at\r\n       15°/4°. Hence a solution saturated at a higher temperature is\r\n       specifically lighter, notwithstanding the greater amount of salt\r\n       it contains. With many substances _surface crystallisation_ cannot\r\n       take place because their solubility increases more rapidly with\r\n       the temperature than their specific gravity decreases. In this\r\n       case the saturated solution will always be in the lower layers,\r\n       where also the crystallisation will take place. Besides which it\r\n       may be added that as a consequence of the properties of water and\r\n       solutions, when they are heated from above (for instance, by the\r\n       sun's rays), the warmer layers being the lightest remain above,\r\n       whilst when heated from below they rise to the top. For this\r\n       reason the water at great depths below the surface is always cold,\r\n       which has long been known. These circumstances, as well as those\r\n       observed by Soret (Chapter I., Note 19), explain the great\r\n       differences of density and temperature, and in the amount of salts\r\n       held in the oceans at different latitudes (in polar and tropical\r\n       climes) and at various depths.\r\n\r\nA saturated[13] solution of table salt (containing 26·4 p.c.) has at the\r\nordinary temperature a specific gravity of about 1·2. The specific\r\ngravity of the crystals is 2·167 (17°). The salt which separates out at\r\nthe ordinary and higher temperatures contains no water of\r\ncrystallisation;[14] but if the crystals are formed at a low\r\ntemperature, especially from a saturated solution cooled to -12°, then\r\nthey present a prismatic form, and contain two equivalents of water,\r\nNaCl,2H_{2}O. At the ordinary temperature these crystals split up into\r\nsodium chloride and its solution.[15] Unsaturated solutions of table salt\r\nwhen cooled below 0° give[16] crystals of ice, but when the solution has\r\na composition NaCl,10H_{2}O it solidifies completely at a temperature of\r\n-23°. A solution of table salt saturated at its boiling point boils at\r\nabout 109°, and contains about 42 parts of salt per 100 parts of water.\r\n\r\n  [13] By combining the results of Poggiale, Müller, and Karsten (they\r\n       are evidently more accurate than those of Gay-Lussac and others) I\r\n       found that a saturated solution at _t_°, from 0° to 108°, contains\r\n       35·7 + 0·024_t_ + 0·0002_t_^2 grams of salt per 100 grams of\r\n       water. This formula gives a solubility at 0° = 35·7 grams (= 26·3\r\n       p.c.), whilst according to Karsten it is 36·09, Poggiale 35·5, and\r\n       Müller 35·6 grams.\r\n\r\n  [14] Perfectly pure _fused_ salt is not hygroscopic, according to\r\n       Karsten, whilst the crystallised salt, even when quite pure,\r\n       attracts as much as 0·6 p.c. of water from moist air, according to\r\n       Stas. (In the Briansk mines, where the temperature throughout the\r\n       whole year is about +10°, it may be observed, as Baron Klodt\r\n       informed me, that in the summer during damp weather the walls\r\n       become moist, while in winter they are dry).\r\n\r\n       If the salt contain impurities--such as magnesium sulphate, &c.--it\r\n       is more hygroscopic. If it contain any magnesium chloride, it\r\n       partially deliquesces in a damp atmosphere. The crystallised and\r\n       not perfectly pure salt decrepitates when heated, owing to its\r\n       containing water. The pure salt, and also the transparent rock\r\n       salt, or that which has been once fused, does not decrepitate.\r\n       Fused sodium chloride shows a faint alkaline reaction to litmus,\r\n       which has been noticed by many observers, and is due to the\r\n       presence of sodium oxide (probably by the action of the oxygen of\r\n       the atmosphere). According to A. Stcherbakoff very sensitive\r\n       litmus (washed in alcohol and neutralised with oxalic acid) shows\r\n       an alkaline reaction even with the crystallised salt.\r\n\r\n       It may be observed that rock salt sometimes contains cavities\r\n       filled with a colourless liquid. Certain kinds of rock salt emit\r\n       an odour like that of hydrocarbons. These phenomena have as yet\r\n       received very little attention.\r\n\r\n  [15] By cooling a solution of table salt saturated at the ordinary\r\n       temperature to -15°, I obtained first of all well-formed tabular\r\n       (six-sided) crystals, which when warmed to the ordinary\r\n       temperature disintegrated (with the separation of anhydrous sodium\r\n       chloride), and then prismatic needles up to 20 mm. long were\r\n       formed from the same solution. I have not yet investigated the\r\n       reason of the difference in crystalline form. It is known\r\n       (Mitscherlich) that NaI,2H_{2}O also crystallises either in plates\r\n       or prisms. Sodium bromide also crystallises with 2H_{2}O at the\r\n       ordinary temperature.\r\n\r\n  [16] Notwithstanding the great simplicity (Chapter I., Note 49) of the\r\n       observations on the formation of ice from solution, still even for\r\n       sodium chloride they cannot yet be considered as sufficiently\r\n       harmonious. According to Blagden and Raoult, the temperature of\r\n       the formation of ice from a solution containing _c_ grams of salt\r\n       per 100 grams of water =-0·6_c_ to _c_ = 10, according to Rosetti\r\n       =-0·649_c_ to _c_ = 8·7, according to De Coppet (to _c_ = 10)\r\n       =-0·55_c_-0·006_c_^2, according to Karsten (to _c_ = 10)-0·762_c_\r\n       + 0·0084_c_^2, and according to Guthrie a much lower figure. By\r\n       taking Rosetti's figure and applying the rule given in Chapter I.,\r\n       Note 49 we obtain--\r\n\r\n                     _i_ - 0·649 × 58·5/18·5 = 2·05.\r\n\r\n       Pickering (1893) gives for _c_ = 1-0·603, for _c_ = 2-1·220; that\r\n       is (_c_ up to 2·7) about -(0·600 + 0·005_c_)_c_.\r\n\r\n       The data for strong solutions are not less contradictory. Thus\r\n       with 20 p.c. of salt, ice is formed at -14·4° according to\r\n       Karsten,-17° according to Guthrie,-17·6° according to De Coppet.\r\n       Rüdorff states that for strong solutions the temperature of the\r\n       formation of ice descends in proportion to the contents of the\r\n       compound, NaCl,2H_{2}O (per 100 grams of water) by 0°·342 per 1\r\n       gram of salt, and De Coppet shows that there is no\r\n       proportionality, in a strict sense, for either a percentage of\r\n       NaCl or of NaCl,2H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nOf all its physical properties the specific gravity of solutions of\r\nsodium chloride is the one which has been the most fully investigated. A\r\ncomparison of all the existing determinations of the specific gravity of\r\nsolutions of NaCl[17] at 15° (in vacuo, taking water at 4° as 10,000),\r\nwith regard to _p_ (the percentage amount of the salt in solution), show\r\nthat it is expressed by the equation S_{15} = 9991·6 + 71·17_p_ +\r\n0·2140_p_^2. For instance, for a solution 200H_{2}O + NaCl, in which case\r\n_p_ = 1·6, S_{15} = 1·0106. It is seen from the formula that the addition\r\nof water produces a contraction.[18] The specific gravity[19] at certain\r\ntemperatures and concentrations in vacuo referred to water at 4° =\r\n10,000[20] is here given for\r\n\r\n                           0°    15°    30°    100°\r\n               _p_ =  5  10372  10353  10307   9922\r\n                     10  10768  10728  10669  10278\r\n                     15  11164  11107  11043  10652\r\n                     20  11568  11501  11429  11043\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that Baumé's hydrometer is graduated by taking a\r\n10 p.c. solution of sodium chloride as 10° on the scale, and therefore\r\nit gives approximately the percentage amount of the salt in a solution.\r\nCommon salt is somewhat soluble in alcohol,[21] but it is insoluble in\r\nether and in oils.\r\n\r\n  [17] A collection of observations on the specific gravity of solutions\r\n       of sodium chloride is given in my work cited in Chapter I.,\r\n       Note 50.\r\n\r\n       Solutions of common salt have also been frequently investigated as\r\n       regards rate of _diffusion_ (Chapter I.), but as yet there are no\r\n       complete data in this respect. It may be mentioned that Graham and\r\n       De Vries demonstrated that diffusion in gelatinous masses (for\r\n       instance, gelatin jelly, or gelatinous silica) proceeds in the\r\n       same manner as in water, which may probably lead to a convenient\r\n       and accurate method for the investigation of the phenomena of\r\n       diffusion. N. Umoff (Odessa, 1888) investigated the diffusion of\r\n       common salt by means of glass globules of definite density. Having\r\n       poured water into a cylinder over a layer of a solution of sodium\r\n       chloride, he observed during a period of several months the\r\n       position (height) of the globules, which floated up higher and\r\n       higher as the salt permeated upwards. Umoff found that at a\r\n       constant temperature the distances of the globules (that is, the\r\n       length of a column limited by layers of definite concentration)\r\n       remain constant; that at a given moment of time the concentration,\r\n       _q_, of different layers situated at a depth _z_ is expressed by\r\n       the equation B-K_z_ = log.(A-_q_), where A, B, and K are\r\n       constants; that at a given moment the rate of diffusion of the\r\n       different layers is proportional to their depth, &_c._\r\n\r\n  [18] If _S__{0} be the specific gravity of water, and _S_ the specific\r\n       gravity of a solution containing _p_ p.c. of salt, then by mixing\r\n       equal weights of water and the solution, we shall obtain a\r\n       solution containing 1/2_p_ of the salt, and if it be formed\r\n       without contraction, then its specific gravity _x_ will be\r\n       determined by the equation 2/_x_ = 1/S_{0} + 1/S, because the\r\n       volume is equal to the weight divided by the density. In reality,\r\n       the specific gravity is always found to be greater than that\r\n       calculated on the supposition of an absence of contraction.\r\n\r\n  [19] Generally the specific gravity is observed by weighing in air and\r\n       dividing the weight in grams by the volume in cubic centimetres,\r\n       the latter being found from the weight of water displaced, divided\r\n       by its density at the temperature at which the experiment is\r\n       carried out. If we call this specific gravity S_{1}, then as a\r\n       cubic centimetre of air under the usual conditions weighs about\r\n       0·0012 gram, the sp. gr. in a vacuum S = S_{1} + 0·0012 (S_{1}\r\n       - 1), if the density of water = 1.\r\n\r\n  [20] If the sp. gr. S_{2} be found directly by dividing the weight of a\r\n       solution by the weight of water at the same temperature and in the\r\n       same volume, then the true sp. gr. _S_ referred to water at 4° is\r\n       found by multiplying S_{2} by the sp. gr. of water at the\r\n       temperature of observation.\r\n\r\n  [21] According to Schiff 100 grams of alcohol, containing _p_ p.c. by\r\n       weight of C_{2}H_{6}O, dissolves at 15°--\r\n\r\n                    _p_ =  10    20    40    60   80\r\n                          28·5  22·6  13·2  5·9  1·2 grams NaCl.\r\n\r\nCommon salt gives very few compounds[22] (double salts) and these are\r\nvery readily decomposed: it is also decomposed with great difficulty and\r\nits dissociation is unknown.[23] But it is easily decomposed, both when\r\nfused and in solution, by the action of a galvanic current. If the dry\r\nsalt be fused in a crucible and an electric current be passed through it\r\nby immersing carbon or platinum electrodes in it (the positive electrode\r\nis made of carbon and the negative of platinum or mercury), it is\r\n_decomposed_: the suffocating gas, chlorine, is liberated at the positive\r\npole and metallic sodium at the negative pole. Both of them act on the\r\nexcess of water at the moment of their evolution; the sodium evolves\r\nhydrogen and forms caustic soda, and the chlorine evolves oxygen and\r\nforms hydrochloric acid, and therefore on passing a current through a\r\nsolution of common salt metallic sodium will not be obtained--but oxygen,\r\nchlorine, and hydrochloric acid will appear at the positive pole, and\r\nhydrogen and caustic soda at the negative pole.[23 bis] Thus salt, like\r\nother salts, is decomposed by the action of an electric current into a\r\nmetal and a haloid (Chapter III.) Naturally, like all other salts, it may\r\nbe formed from the corresponding base and acid with the separation of\r\nwater. In fact if we mix caustic soda (base) with hydrochloric acid\r\n(acid), table salt is formed, NaHO + HCl = NaCl + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [22] Amongst the double salts formed by sodium chloride that obtained\r\n       by Ditte (1870) by the evaporation of the solution remaining after\r\n       heating sodium iodate with hydrochloric acid until chlorine ceases\r\n       to be liberated, is a remarkable one. Its composition is\r\n       NaIO_{3},NaCl,14H_{2}O. Rammelsberg obtained a similar (perhaps\r\n       the same) salt in well-formed crystals by the direct reaction of\r\n       both salts.\r\n\r\n  [23] But it gives sodium in the flame of a Bunsen's burner (see\r\n       Spectrum Analysis), doubtless under the reducing action of the\r\n       elements carbon and hydrogen. In the presence of an excess of\r\n       hydrochloric acid in the flame (when the sodium would form sodium\r\n       chloride), no sodium is formed in the flame and the salt does not\r\n       communicate its usual coloration.\r\n\r\n  [23 bis] There is no doubt, however, but that chloride of sodium is\r\n       also decomposed in its aqueous solutions with the separation of\r\n       sodium, and that it does not simply enter into double\r\n       decomposition with the water (NaCl + H_{2}O = NaHO + HCl). This is\r\n       seen from the fact that when a saturated solution of NaCl is\r\n       rapidly decomposed by an electric current, a large amount of\r\n       chlorine appears at the anode and a sodium amalgam forms at the\r\n       mercury cathode, which acts but slowly upon the strong solution of\r\n       salt. Castner's process for the electrolysis of brine into\r\n       chlorine and caustic soda is an application of this method which\r\n       has been already worked in England on an industrial scale.\r\n\r\nWith resspect to the double decompositions of sodium chloride it should\r\nbe observed that they are most varied, and serve as means of obtaining\r\nnearly all the other compounds of sodium and chlorine.\r\n\r\n_The double decompositions of sodium chloride_ are almost exclusively\r\nbased on the possibility of the metal sodium being exchanged for\r\nhydrogen and other metals. But neither hydrogen nor any other metal can\r\ndirectly displace the sodium from sodium chloride. This would result\r\nin the separation of metallic sodium, which itself displaces hydrogen\r\nand the majority of other metals from their compounds, and is not,\r\nso far as is known, ever separated by them. The replacement of the\r\nsodium in sodium chloride by hydrogen and various metals can only take\r\nplace by the transference of the sodium into some other combination.\r\nIf hydrogen or a metal, M, be combined with an element X, then the\r\ndouble decomposition NaCl + MX = NaX + MCl takes place. Such double\r\ndecompositions take place under special conditions, sometimes completely\r\nand sometimes only partially, as we shall endeavour to explain. In order\r\nto acquaint ourselves with the double decompositions of sodium chloride,\r\nwe will follow the methods actually employed in practice to procure\r\ncompounds of sodium and of chlorine from common salt. For this purpose\r\nwe will first describe the treatment of sodium chloride with sulphuric\r\nacid for the preparation of hydrochloric acid and sodium sulphate.\r\nWe will then describe the substances obtained from hydrochloric acid\r\nand sodium sulphate. Chlorine itself, and nearly all the compounds of\r\nthis element, may be procured from hydrochloric acid, whilst sodium\r\ncarbonate, caustic soda, metallic sodium itself and all its compounds,\r\nmay be obtained from sodium sulphate.\r\n\r\nEven in the animal organism salt undergoes similar changes, furnishing\r\nthe sodium, alkali, and hydrochloric acid which take part in the\r\nprocesses of animal life.\r\n\r\nIts necessity as a constituent in the food both of human beings and of\r\nanimals becomes evident when we consider that both hydrochloric acid and\r\nsalts of sodium are found in the substances which are separated out from\r\nthe blood into the stomach and intestines. Sodium salts are found in the\r\nblood and in the bile which is elaborated in the liver and acts on the\r\nfood in the alimentary canal, whilst hydrochloric acid is found in the\r\nacid juices of the stomach. Chlorides of the metals are always found in\r\nconsiderable quantities in the urine, and if they are excreted they must\r\nbe replenished in the organism; and for the replenishment of the loss,\r\nsubstances containing chlorine compounds must be taken in food. Not only\r\ndo animals consume those small amounts of sodium chloride which are\r\nfound in drinking water or in plants or other animals, but experience\r\nhas shown that many wild animals travel long distances in search of salt\r\nsprings, and that domestic animals which in their natural condition do\r\nnot require salt, willingly take it, and that the functions of their\r\norganisms become much more regular from their doing so.\r\n\r\n_The action of sulphuric acid on sodium chloride._--If sulphuric acid\r\nbe poured over common salt, then even at the ordinary temperature, as\r\nGlauber observed, an odorous gas, hydrochloric acid, is evolved. The\r\nreaction which takes place consists in the sodium of the salt and the\r\nhydrogen of the sulphuric acid changing places.\r\n\r\n           NaCl    +  H_{2}SO_{4}  =      HCl       +   NaHSO_{4}\r\n          Sodium      Sulphuric       Hydrochloric     Acid sodium\r\n         chloride       acid              acid          sulphate\r\n\r\nAt the ordinary temperature this reaction is not complete, but soon\r\nceases. When the mixture is heated, the decomposition proceeds until,\r\nif there be sufficient salt present, all the sulphuric acid taken is\r\nconverted into acid sodium sulphate. Any excess of acid will remain\r\nunaltered. If 2 molecules of sodium chloride (117 parts) be taken per\r\nmolecule of sulphuric acid (98 parts), then on heating the mixture to\r\na moderate temperature only one-half (58·5) of the salt will suffer\r\nchange. Complete decomposition, after which neither hydrogen nor\r\nchlorine is left in the residue, proceeds (when 117 parts of table salt\r\nare taken per 98 parts of sulphuric acid) _at a red heat only_. Then--\r\n\r\n           2NaCl  +  H_{2}SO_{4}  =      2HCl      +  Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n           Table      Sulphuric      Hydrochloric        Sodium\r\n           salt         acid             acid           sulphate\r\n\r\nThis double decomposition is the result of the action of the acid\r\nsalt, NaHSO_{4}, first formed, on sodium chloride, for the acid salt,\r\nsince it contains hydrogen, itself acts like an acid, NaCl + NaHSO_{4}\r\n= HCl + Na_{2}SO_{4}. By adding this equation to the first we obtain\r\nthe second, which expresses the ultimate reaction. Hence in the above\r\nreaction, non-volatile or sparingly volatile table salt and sparingly\r\nvolatile sulphuric acid are taken, and as the result of their reaction,\r\nafter the hydrogen and sodium have exchanged places, there is obtained\r\nnon-volatile sodium sulphate and gaseous hydrochloric acid. The fact\r\nof the latter being a gaseous substance forms the main reason for the\r\nreaction proceeding to the very end. The mechanism of this kind of\r\ndouble decomposition, and the cause of the course of the reaction, are\r\nexactly the same as those we saw in the decomposition of nitre (Chapter\r\nVI.) by the action of sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid in each case\r\ndisplaces the other, volatile, acid.\r\n\r\nNot only in these two instances, but in every instance, if a volatile\r\nacid can be formed by the substitution of the hydrogen of sulphuric\r\nacid for a metal, then this volatile acid will be formed. From this it\r\nmay be concluded that the volatility of the acid should be considered\r\nas the cause of the progress of the reaction; and indeed if the acid be\r\nsoluble but not volatile, or if the reaction take place in an enclosed\r\nspace where the resulting acid cannot volatilise, or at the ordinary\r\ntemperature when it does not pass into the state of elastic vapour--then\r\nthe decomposition does not proceed to the end, but only up to a certain\r\nlimit. In this respect the explanations given at the beginning of this\r\ncentury by the French chemist Berthollet in his work 'Essai de Statique\r\nChimique' are very important. _The doctrine of Berthollet_ starts from\r\nthe supposition that the chemical reaction of substances is determined\r\nnot only by the degrees of affinity between the different parts, but\r\nalso by the relative masses of the reacting substances and by those\r\nphysical conditions under which the reaction takes place. Two substances\r\ncontaining the elements MX and NY, being brought into contact with\r\neach other, form by double decomposition the compounds MY and NX; but\r\nthe formation of these two new compounds will not proceed to the end\r\nunless one of them is removed from the sphere of action. But it can\r\nonly be removed if it possesses different physical properties from\r\nthose of the other substances which are present with it. Either it must\r\nbe a gas while the others are liquid or solid, or an insoluble solid\r\nwhile the others are liquid or soluble. The relative amounts of the\r\nresultant substances, if nothing separates out from their intermixture,\r\ndepend only on the relative quantities of the substances MX and NY, and\r\nupon the degrees of attraction existing between the elements M, N, X,\r\nand Y; but however great their mass may be, and however considerable\r\nthe attractions, still in any case if nothing separates out from the\r\nsphere of action the decomposition will presently cease, a state of\r\nequilibrium will be established, and instead of two there will remain\r\nfour substances in the mass: namely, a portion of the original bodies\r\nMX and NY, and a certain quantity of the newly formed substances MY and\r\nNX, if it be assumed that neither MN or XY nor any other substances are\r\nproduced, and this may for the present[24] be admitted in the case of\r\nthe double decomposition of salts in which M and X are metals and X and\r\nY haloids. As the ordinary double decomposition here consists merely\r\nin the exchange of metals, the above simplification is applicable. The\r\nsum total of existing data concerning the double decomposition of salts\r\nleads to the conclusion that from salts MX + NY there always arises\r\na certain quantity of NX and MY, as should be the case according to\r\nBerthollet's doctrine. A portion of the historical data concerning\r\nthis subject will be afterwards mentioned, but we will at once proceed\r\nto point out the observations made by Spring (1888) which show that\r\n_even in a solid state_ salts are subject to a similar interchange of\r\nmetals if in a condition of sufficiently close contact (it requires\r\ntime, a finely divided state, and intimate mixture). Spring took two\r\nnon-hygroscopic salts, potassium nitrate, KNO_{3}, and well-dried sodium\r\nacetate, C_{2}H_{3}NaO_{2}, and left a mixture of their powders for\r\nseveral months in a desiccator. An interchange of metals took place, as\r\nwas seen from the fact that the resultant mass rapidly attracted the\r\nmoisture of the air, owing to the formation of sodium nitrate, NaNO_{3},\r\nand potassium acetate, C_{2}H_{3}KO_{2}, both of which are highly\r\nhygroscopic.[24 bis]\r\n\r\n  [24] If MX and NY represent the molecules of two salts, and if there be\r\n       _no third substance_ present (such as water in a solution), the\r\n       formation of XY would also be possible; for instance, cyanogen,\r\n       iodine, &c. are capable of combining with simple haloids, as well\r\n       as with the complex groups which in certain salts play the part of\r\n       haloids. Besides which the salts MX and NY or MY with NX may form\r\n       double salts. If the number of molecules be unequal, or if the\r\n       valency of the elements or groups contained in them be different,\r\n       as in NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4}, where Cl is a univalent haloid and\r\n       SO_{4} is bivalent, then the matter may be complicated by the\r\n       formation of other compounds besides MY and NX, and when a solvent\r\n       participates in the action, and especially if present in large\r\n       proportion, the phenomena must evidently become still more\r\n       complex; and this is actually the case in nature. Hence while\r\n       placing before the reader a certain portion of the existing store\r\n       of knowledge concerning the phenomena of double saline\r\n       decompositions, I cannot consider the theory of the subject as\r\n       complete, and have therefore limited myself to a few data, the\r\n       completion of which must be sought in more detailed works on the\r\n       subject of theoretical chemistry, without losing sight of what has\r\n       been said above.\r\n\r\n  [24 bis] When the mixture of potassium nitrate and sodium acetate was\r\n       heated by Spring to 100°, it was completely fused into one mass,\r\n       although potassium nitrate fuses at about 340° and sodium nitrate\r\n       at about 320°.\r\n\r\nWhen Berthollet enunciated his doctrine the present views of atoms and\r\nmolecules had yet to be developed, and it is now necessary to submit the\r\nmatter to examination in the light of these conceptions; we will\r\ntherefore consider the reaction of salts, taking M and N, X and Y as\r\nequivalent to each other--that is, as capable of replacing each other 'in\r\ntoto,' as Na or K,, 1/2Ca or 1/2Mg (bivalent elements) replace hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAnd since, according to Berthollet's doctrine, when _m_MX of one salt\r\ncomes into contact with _n_NY of another salt, a certain quantity _x_MY\r\nand _x_NX is formed, there remains _m_-_x_ of the salt MX, and _n_-_x_\r\nof the salt NY. If _m_ be greater than _n_, then the maximum interchange\r\ncould lead to _x_ = _n_, whilst from the salts taken there would be\r\nformed _n_MY + _n_NX + (_m_-_n_)MX--that is, a portion of one only of\r\nthe salts taken would remain unchanged because the reaction could only\r\nproceed between _n_MX and _n_NY. If _x_ were actually equal to _n_, the\r\nmass of the salt MX would not have any influence on the _modus operandi_\r\nof the reaction, which is equally in accordance with the teaching of\r\nBergmann, who supposed double reactions to be independent of the mass\r\nand determined by affinity only. If M had more affinity for X than for\r\nY, and N more affinity for Y than for X, then according to Bergmann\r\nthere would be no decomposition whatever, and _x_ would equal 0. If\r\nthe affinity of M for Y and of N for X were greater than those in the\r\noriginal grouping, then the affinity of M for X and of N for Y would be\r\novercome, and, according to Bergmann's doctrine, complete interchange\r\nwould take place--_i.e._ _x_ would equal _n_. According to Berthollet's\r\nteaching, a distribution of M and N between X and Y will take place\r\nin every case, not only in proportion to the degrees of affinity, but\r\nalso in proportion to the masses, so that with a small affinity and a\r\nlarge mass the same action can be produced as with a large affinity\r\nand a small mass. Therefore, (1) _x_ will always be less than _n_ and\r\ntheir ratio _x_/_n_ less than unity--that is, the decomposition will be\r\nexpressed by the equation, _m_MX + _n_NY = (_m_-_x_)MX + (_n_-_x_)NY\r\n+ _x_MY + _x_NX; (2) by increasing the mass _m_ we increase the\r\ndecomposition--that is, we increase _x_ and the ratio _x_/(_n_-_x_),\r\nuntil with an infinitely large quantity m the fraction _x_/_n_ will\r\nequal 1, and the decomposition will be complete, however small the\r\naffinities uniting MY and NX may be; and (3) if _m_ = _n_, by taking MX\r\n+ NY or MY + NX we arrive at one and the same system _in either case_:\r\n(_n_-_x_)MX + (_n_-_x_)NY + _x_MY + _x_NX. These direct consequences of\r\nBerthollet's teaching are verified by experience. Thus, for example,\r\na mixture of solutions of sodium nitrate and potassium chloride in\r\nall cases has entirely the same properties as a mixture of solutions\r\nof potassium nitrate and sodium chloride, of course on condition that\r\nthe mixed solutions are of identical elementary composition. But this\r\nidentity of properties might either proceed from one system of salts\r\npassing entirely into the other (Bergmann's hypothesis) in conformity\r\nwith the predominating affinities (for instance, from KCl + NaNO_{3}\r\nthere might arise KNO_{3} + NaCl, if it be admitted that the affinities\r\nof the elements as combined in the latter system are greater than in\r\nthe former); or, on the other hand, it might be because both systems by\r\nthe interchange of a portion of their elements give one and the same\r\nstate of equilibrium, as according to Berthollet's teaching. Experiment\r\nproves the latter hypothesis to be the true one. But before citing\r\nthe most historically important experiments verifying Berthollet's\r\ndoctrine, we must stop to consider the conception _of the mass_ of the\r\nreacting substances. Berthollet understood by mass the actual relative\r\nquantity of a substance; but now it is impossible to understand this\r\nterm otherwise than as the number of molecules, for they act as chemical\r\nunits, and in the special case of double saline decompositions it is\r\nbetter to take it as the number of equivalents. Thus in the reaction\r\nNaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} the salt is taken in one equivalent and the acid in\r\ntwo. If 2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} act, then the number of equivalents are\r\nequal, and so on. The _influence of mass_ on the amount of decomposition\r\n_x_/_n_ forms the root of Berthollet's doctrine, and therefore we will\r\nfirst of all turn our attention to the establishment of this principle\r\nin relation to the double decomposition of salts.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840 H. Rose[25] showed that water decomposes metallic sulphides\r\nlike calcium sulphide, CaS, forming hydrogen sulphide, H_{2}S,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the affinity of hydrogen sulphide, as an\r\nacid, for lime, CaH_{2}O_{2}, as a base, causes them to react on each\r\nother, forming calcium sulphide and water, CaS + 2H_{2}O. Furthermore,\r\nRose showed that the greater the amount of water acting on the calcium\r\nsulphide, the more complete is the decomposition. The results of this\r\nreaction are evident from the fact that the hydrogen sulphide formed\r\nmay be expelled from the solution by heating, and that the resulting\r\nlime is sparingly soluble in water. Rose clearly saw from this that such\r\nfeeble agents, in a chemical sense, as carbonic anhydride and water, by\r\nacting in a mass and for long periods of time in nature on the durable\r\nrocks, which resist the action of the most powerful acids, are able\r\nto bring about chemical change--to extract, for example, from rocks\r\nthe bases, lime, soda, potash. The influence of the mass of water on\r\nantimonious chloride, bismuth nitrate, &c., is essentially of the same\r\ncharacter. These substances give up to the water a quantity of acid\r\nwhich is greater in proportion as the mass of the water acting on them\r\nis greater.[25 bis]\r\n\r\n  [25] H. Rose is more especially known for his having carefully studied\r\n       and perfected several methods for the exact chemical analysis of\r\n       many mineral substances. His predecessor in this branch of\r\n       research was Berzelius, and his successor Fresenius.\r\n\r\n  [25 bis] Historically the influence of the mass of water was the first\r\n       well-observed phenomenon in support of Berthollet's teaching, and\r\n       it should not now be forgotten. In double decompositions taking\r\n       place in dilute solutions where the mass of water is large, its\r\n       influence, notwithstanding the weakness of affinities, must he\r\n       great, according to the very essence of Berthollet's doctrine.\r\n\r\n       As explaining the action of the mass of water, the experiments of\r\n       Pattison Muir (1879) are very instructive. These experiments\r\n       demonstrate that the decomposition of bismuth chloride is the more\r\n       complete the greater the relative quantity of water, and the less\r\n       the mass of hydrochloric acid forming one of the products of the\r\n       reaction.\r\n\r\nBarium sulphate, BaSO_{4}, which is insoluble in water, when fused with\r\nsodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, gives, but not completely, barium\r\ncarbonate, BaCO_{3}, (also insoluble), and sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}.\r\nIf a solution of sodium carbonate acts on precipitated barium sulphate,\r\nthe same decomposition is also effected (Dulong, Rose), but it is\r\nrestricted by a limit and requires time. A mixture of sodium carbonate\r\nand sulphate is obtained in the solution and a mixture of barium\r\ncarbonate and sulphate in the precipitate. If the solution be decanted\r\noff and a fresh solution of sodium carbonate be poured over the\r\nprecipitate, then a fresh portion of the barium sulphate passes into\r\nbarium carbonate, and so by increasing the mass of sodium carbonate it is\r\npossible to entirely convert the barium sulphate into barium carbonate.\r\nIf a definite quantity of sodium sulphate be added to the solution of\r\nsodium carbonate, then the latter will have no action whatever on the\r\nbarium sulphate, because then a system in equilibrium determined by the\r\nreverse action of the sodium sulphate on the barium carbonate and by the\r\npresence of both sodium carbonate and sulphate in the solution, is at\r\nonce arrived at. On the other hand, if the mass of the sodium sulphate in\r\nthe solution be great, then the barium carbonate is reconverted into\r\nsulphate until a definite state of equilibrium is attained between the\r\ntwo opposite reactions, producing barium carbonate by the action of the\r\nsodium carbonate and barium sulphate by the action of the sodium\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\nAnother most important principle of Berthollet's teaching is the\r\nexistence of _a limit of exchange decomposition_, or _the attainment\r\nof a state of equilibrium_. In this respect the determinations of\r\nMalaguti (1857) are historically the most important. He took a mixture\r\nof solutions of equivalent quantities of two salts, MX and NY, and\r\njudged the amount of the resulting exchange from the composition of the\r\nprecipitate produced by the addition of alcohol. When, for example, zinc\r\nsulphate and sodium chloride (ZnSO_{4} and 2NaCl) were taken, there\r\nwere produced by exchange sodium sulphate and zinc chloride. A mixture\r\nof zinc sulphate and sodium sulphate was precipitated by an excess of\r\nalcohol, and it appeared from the composition of the precipitate that\r\n72 per cent. of the salts taken had been decomposed. When, however, a\r\nmixture of solutions of sodium sulphate and zinc chloride was taken, the\r\nprecipitate presented the same composition as before--that is, about 28\r\nper cent. of the salts taken had been subjected to decomposition. In\r\na similar experiment with a mixture of sodium chloride and magnesium\r\nsulphate, 2NaCl + MgSO_{4} or MgCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4}, about half of\r\nthe metals underwent the decomposition, which may be expressed by\r\nthe equation 4NaCl + 2MgSO_{4} = 2NaCl + MgSO_{4} + Na_{2}SO_{4} +\r\nMgCl_{2} = 2Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2MgCl_{2}. A no less clear limit expressed\r\nitself in another of Malaguti's researches when he investigated the\r\nabove-mentioned reversible reactions of the insoluble salts of barium.\r\nWhen, for example, barium carbonate and sodium sulphate (BaCO_{3} +\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}) were taken, then about 72 per cent. of the salts were\r\ndecomposed, that is, were converted into barium sulphate and sodium\r\ncarbonate. But when the two latter salts were taken, then about 19\r\nper cent. of them passed into barium carbonate and sodium sulphate.\r\nProbably the end of the reaction was not reached in either case, because\r\nthis would require a considerable time and a uniformity of conditions\r\nattainable with difficulty.\r\n\r\nGladstone (1855) took advantage of the colour of solutions of different\r\nferric salts for determining the measure of exchange between metals.\r\nThus a solution of ferric thiocyanate has a most intense red colour, and\r\nby making a comparison between the colour of the resulting solutions and\r\nthe colour of solutions of known strength it was possible to judge to a\r\ncertain degree the quantity of the thiocyanate formed. This colorimetric\r\nmethod of determination has an important significance as being the\r\nfirst in which a method was applied for determining the composition\r\nof a solution without the removal of any of its component parts. When\r\nGladstone took equivalent quantities of ferric nitrate and potassium\r\nthiocyanate--Fe(NO_{3})_{3} + 3KCNS--only 13 per cent. of the salts\r\nunderwent decomposition. On increasing the mass of the latter salt the\r\nquantity of ferric thiocyanate formed increased, but even when more than\r\n300 equivalents of potassium thiocyanate were taken a portion of the\r\niron still remained as nitrate. It is evident that the affinity acting\r\nbetween Fe and NO_{3} and between K and CNS on the one hand, is greater\r\nthan the affinity acting between Fe and CNS, together with the affinity\r\nof K for NO_{3}, on the other hand. The investigation of the variation\r\nof the fluorescence of quinine sulphate, as well as the variation of the\r\nrotation of the plane of polarisation of nicotine, gave in the hands\r\nof Gladstone many proofs of the entire applicability of Berthollet's\r\ndoctrine, and in particular demonstrated the influence of mass which\r\nforms the chief distinctive feature of the teaching of Berthollet,\r\nteaching little appreciated in his own time.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1860, the doctrine of the limit of reaction\r\nand of the influence of mass on the process of chemical transformations\r\nreceived a very important support in the researches of Berthelot and\r\nP. de Saint-Gilles on the formation of the ethereal salts RX from the\r\nalcohols ROH and acids HX, when water is also formed. This conversion is\r\nessentially very similar to the formation of salts, but differs in that\r\nit proceeds slowly at the ordinary temperature, extending over whole\r\nyears, and is not complete--that is, it has a distinct limit determined\r\nby a reverse reaction; thus an ethereal salt RX with water gives an\r\nalcohol ROH and an acid HX--up to that limit generally corresponding\r\nwith two-thirds of the alcohol taken, if the action proceed between\r\nmolecular quantities of alcohol and acid. Thus common alcohol,\r\nC_{2}H_{5}OH, with acetic acid, HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}, gives the following\r\nsystem rapidly when heated, or slowly at the ordinary temperature, ROH\r\n+ HX + 2RX + 2H_{2}O, whether we start from 3RHO + 3HX or from 3RX +\r\n3H_{2}O. The process and completion of the reaction in this instance\r\nare very easily observed, because the quantity of free acid is easily\r\ndetermined from the amount of alkali requisite for its saturation, as\r\nneither alcohol nor ethereal salt acts on litmus or other reagent for\r\nacids. Under the influence of an increased mass of alcohol the reaction\r\nproceeds further. If two molecules of alcohol, RHO, be taken for every\r\none molecule of acetic acid, HX, then instead of 66 p.c., 83 p.c. of\r\nthe acid passes into ethereal salt, and with fifty molecules of RHO\r\nnearly all the acid is etherised. The researches of Menschutkin in their\r\ndetails touched on many important aspects of the same subject, such as\r\nthe influence of the composition of the alcohol and acid on the limit\r\nand rate of exchange--but these, as well as other details, must be\r\nlooked for in special treatises on organic and theoretical chemistry.\r\nIn any case the study of etherification has supplied chemical mechanics\r\nwith clear and valuable data, which directly confirm the two fundamental\r\npropositions of Berthollet; the influence of mass, and the limit of\r\nreaction--that is, the equilibrium between opposite reactions. The study\r\nof numerous instances of dissociation which we have already touched on,\r\nand shall again meet with on several occasions, gave the same results.\r\nWith respect to double saline decompositions, it is also necessary to\r\nmention the researches of Wiedemann on the decomposing action of a mass\r\nof water on the ferric salts, which could be determined by measuring the\r\nmagnetism of the solutions, because the ferric oxide (soluble colloid)\r\nset free by the water is less magnetic than the ferric salts.\r\n\r\nA very important epoch in the history of Berthollet's doctrine was\r\nattained when, in 1867, the Norwegian chemists, Guldberg and Waage,\r\nexpressed it as an algebraical formula. They defined the active mass\r\nas the number of molecules contained in a given volume, and assumed,\r\nas follows from the spirit of Berthollet's teaching, that the action\r\nbetween the substances was equal to the product of the masses of the\r\nreacting substances. Hence if the salts MX and NY be taken in equivalent\r\nquantities (_m_ = 1 and _n_ = 1) and the salts MY and NX are not\r\nadded to the mixture but proceed from it, then if _k_ represent the\r\ncoefficient of the rate of the action of MX on NY and if _k_´ represent\r\nthe same coefficient for the pair MY and NX, then we shall have at the\r\nmoment when the decomposition equals x a measure of action for the first\r\npair: _k_(1-_x_)(1-_x_) and for the second pair _k´xx_, and a state of\r\nequilibrium or limit will be reached when _k_(1-_x_)^2 = _k_´_x_^2,\r\nwhence the ratio _k_/_k_´ = [_x_/(1-_x_)]^2. Therefore in the case of\r\nthe action of alcohol on an acid, when _x_ = 2/3, the magnitude _k_/_k_´\r\n= 4, that is, the reaction of the alcohol on the acid is four times as\r\nfast as that of the ethereal salt on water. If the ratio _k_/_k_´ be\r\nknown, then the influence of mass may be easily determined from it. Thus\r\nif instead of one molecule of alcohol two be taken, then the equation\r\nwill be _k_(2-_x_)(1-_x_) = _k´xx_, whence _x_ = 0·85 or 85 percent.,\r\nwhich is close to the result of experiment. If 300 molecules of alcohol\r\nbe taken, then x proves to be approximately 100 per cent., which is also\r\nfound to be the case by experiment.[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] From the above it follows that an excess of acid should influence\r\n       the reaction like an excess of alcohol. It is in fact shown by\r\n       experiment that if two molecules of acetic acid be taken to one\r\n       molecule of alcohol, 84 p.c. of alcohol is etherified. If with a\r\n       large preponderance of acid or of alcohol certain discrepancies\r\n       are observed, their cause must be looked for in the incomplete\r\n       correspondence of the conditions and external influences.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to subject the formation of salts to any process\r\ndirectly analogous to that which is so conveniently effected in\r\netherification. Many efforts have, however, been made to solve the\r\nproblem of the measure of reaction in this case also. Thus, for example,\r\nKhichinsky (1866), Petrieff (1885), and many others investigated the\r\ndistribution of metals and haloid groups in the case of one metal and\r\nseveral haloids taken in excess, as acids; or conversely with an excess\r\nof bases, the distribution of these bases with relation to an acid; in\r\ncases where a portion of the substances forms a precipitate and a portion\r\nremains in solution. But such complex cases, although they in general\r\nconfirm Berthollet's teaching (for instance, a solution of silver nitrate\r\ngives some silver oxide with lead oxide, and a solution of nitrate of\r\nlead precipitates some lead oxide under the action of silver oxide, as\r\nPetrieff demonstrated), still, owing to the complexity of the phenomena\r\n(for instance, the formation of basic and double salts), they cannot give\r\nsimple results. But much more instructive and complete are researches\r\nlike those made by Pattison Muir (1876), who took the simple case of the\r\nprecipitation of calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}, from the mixture of\r\nsolutions of calcium chloride and sodium or potassium carbonate, and\r\nfound in this case that not only was the rate of action (for example, in\r\nthe case of CaCl_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3}, 75 per cent. of CaCO_{3} was\r\nprecipitated in five minutes, 85 per cent. in thirty minutes, and 94 per\r\ncent. in two days) determined by the temperature, relative mass, and\r\namount of water (a large mass of water decreases the rate), but that the\r\nlimit of decomposition was also dependent on these influences. However,\r\neven in researches of this kind the conditions of reaction are\r\ncomplicated by the non-uniformity of the media, inasmuch as a portion of\r\nthe substance is obtained or remains in the form of a precipitate, so\r\nthat the system is heterogeneous. The investigation of double saline\r\ndecompositions offers many difficulties which cannot be considered as yet\r\nentirely overcome. Although many efforts have long since been made, the\r\nmajority of the researches were carried on in aqueous solutions, and as\r\nwater is itself a saline compound and able to combine with salts and\r\nenter into double decomposition with them, such reactions taking place in\r\nsolutions in reality present very complex cases.[27] In this sense the\r\nreaction between alcohols and acids is much more simple, and therefore\r\nits significance in confirmation of Berthollet's doctrine is of\r\nparticular importance. The only cases which can be compared with these\r\nreactions for simplicity are those exchange decompositions investigated\r\nby G. G. Gustavson, which take place between CCl_{4} and RBr_{n} on the\r\none hand, and CBr_{4} and RCl_{n} on the other. This case is convenient\r\nfor investigation inasmuch as the RCl_{n} and RBr_{n} taken (such as\r\nBCl_{3}, SiCl_{4}, TiCl_{4}, POCl_{3}, and SnCl_{4}) belong to those\r\nsubstances which are decomposed by water, whilst CCl_{4} and CBr_{4} are\r\nnot decomposed by water; and therefore, by heating, for instance, a\r\nmixture of CCl_{4} + SiBr_{4} it is possible to arrive at a conclusion as\r\nto the amount of interchange by treating the product with water, which\r\ndecomposes the SiBr_{4} left unchanged and the SiCl_{4} formed by the\r\nexchange, and therefore by determining the composition of the product\r\nacted on by the water it is possible to form a conclusion as to the\r\namount of decomposition. The mixture was always formed with equivalent\r\nquantities--for instance, 4BCl_{3} + 3CBr_{4}. It appeared that there was\r\nno exchange whatever on simple intermixture, but that it proceeded\r\nslowly, when the mixture was heated (for example, with the mixture above\r\nmentioned at 123° 4·86 per cent. of Cl was replaced by Br after 14 days'\r\nheating, and 6·83 per cent. after 28 days, and 10·12 per cent. when\r\nheated at 150° for 60 days). A limit was always reached which\r\ncorresponded with that of the complemental system; in the given instance\r\nthe system 4BBr_{3} + 3CCl_{4}. In this last 89·97 per cent. of bromine\r\nin the BBr_{3} was replaced by chlorine; that is, there were obtained\r\n89·97 molecules of BCl_{3} and there remained 10·02 molecules of BBr_{3},\r\nand therefore the same state of equilibrium was reached as that given by\r\nthe system 4BCl_{3} + 3CBr_{4}. Both systems gave one and the same state\r\nof equilibrium at the limit, which is in agreement with Berthollet's\r\ndoctrine.[28]\r\n\r\n  [27] As an example two methods may be mentioned, Thomsen's and\r\n       Ostwald's. Thomsen (1869) applied a thermochemical method to\r\n       exceedingly dilute solutions without taking the water into further\r\n       consideration. He took solutions of caustic soda containing\r\n       100H_{2}O per NaHO, and sulphuric acid containing 1/2H_{2}SO_{4} +\r\n       100H_{2}O. In order that these solutions may be mixed in such\r\n       quantities that atomic proportions of acid and alkali would act,\r\n       for forty grams of caustic soda (which answers to its equivalent)\r\n       there should be employed 49 grams of sulphuric acid, and then\r\n       +15,689 heat units would be evolved. If the normal sodium sulphate\r\n       so formed be mixed with _n_ equivalents of sulphuric acid, a\r\n       certain amount of heat is absorbed, namely a quantity equal to\r\n       (_n_.1650)/(_n_ + 0·8) heat units. An equivalent of caustic soda,\r\n       in combining with an equivalent of nitric acid, evolves +13,617\r\n       units of heat, and the augmentation of the amount of nitric acid\r\n       entails an absorption of heat for each equivalent equal to -27\r\n       units; so also in combining with hydrochloric acids +13,740 heat\r\n       units are absorbed, and for each equivalent of hydrochloric acid\r\n       beyond this amount there are absorbed -32 heat units. Thomsen mixed\r\n       each one of three neutral salts, sodium sulphate, sodium chloride\r\n       and sodium nitrate, with an acid which is not contained in it; for\r\n       instance, he mixed a solution of sodium sulphate with a solution\r\n       of nitric acid and determined the number of heat units then\r\n       absorbed. An absorption of heat ensued because a normal salt was\r\n       taken in the first instance, and the mixture of all the above\r\n       normal salts with acid produces an absorption of heat. The amount\r\n       of heat absorbed enabled him to obtain an insight into the process\r\n       taking place in this mixture, for sulphuric acid added to sodium\r\n       sulphate absorbs a considerable quantity of heat, whilst\r\n       hydrochloric and nitric acids absorb a very small amount of heat\r\n       in this case. By mixing an equivalent of sodium sulphate with\r\n       various numbers of equivalents of nitric acid, Thomsen observed\r\n       that the amount of heat absorbed increased more and more as the\r\n       amount of nitric acid was increased; thus when HNO_{3} was taken\r\n       per 1/2Na_{2}SO_{4}, 1,752 heat units were absorbed per equivalent\r\n       of soda contained in the sodium sulphate. When twice as much\r\n       nitric acid was taken, 2,026 heat units, and when three times as\r\n       much, 2,050 heat units were absorbed. Had the double decomposition\r\n       been complete in the case where one equivalent of nitric acid was\r\n       taken per equivalent of Na_{2}SO_{4} then according to calculation\r\n       from similar data there should have been absorbed -2,989 units of\r\n       heat, while in reality only -1,752 units were absorbed. Hence\r\n       Thomsen concluded that a displacement of only about two-thirds of\r\n       the sulphuric acid had taken place--that is, the ratio _k_ : _k_´\r\n       for the reaction 1/2Na_{2}SO_{4} + HNO_{3} and NaNO_{3} +\r\n       1/2H_{2}SO_{4} is equal, as for ethereal salts, to 4. By taking\r\n       this figure and admitting the above supposition, Thomsen found\r\n       that for all mixtures of soda with nitric acid, and of sodium\r\n       nitrate with sulphuric acid, the amounts of heat followed Guldberg\r\n       and Waage's law; that is, the limit of decomposition reached was\r\n       greater the greater the mass of acid added. The relation of\r\n       hydrochloric to sulphuric acid gave the same results. Therefore\r\n       the researches of Thomsen fully confirm the hypotheses of Guldberg\r\n       and Waage and the doctrine of Berthollet.\r\n\r\n       Thomson concludes his investigation with the words: (_a_) 'When\r\n       equivalent quantities of NaHO, HNO_{3} (or HCl) and 1/2H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n       react on one another in an aqueous solution, then two-thirds of\r\n       the soda combines with the nitric and one-third with the sulphuric\r\n       acid; (_b_) this subdivision repeats itself, whether the soda be\r\n       taken combined with nitric or with sulphuric acid; (_c_) and\r\n       therefore nitric acid has double the tendency to combine with the\r\n       base that sulphuric acid has, and hence in an aqueous solution it\r\n       is a stronger acid than the latter.'\r\n\r\n       'It is therefore necessary,' Thomsen afterwards remarks, 'to have\r\n       an expression indicating the tendency of an acid for the\r\n       saturation of bases. This idea cannot be expressed by the word\r\n       _affinity_, because by this term is most often understood that\r\n       force which it is necessary to overcome in order to decompose a\r\n       substance into its component parts. This force should therefore be\r\n       measured by the amount of work or heat employed for the\r\n       decomposition of the substance. The above-mentioned phenomenon is\r\n       of an entirely different nature,' and Thomsen introduces the term\r\n       _avidity_, by which he designates the tendency of acids for\r\n       neutralisation. 'Therefore the avidity of nitric acid with respect\r\n       to soda is twice as great as the avidity of sulphuric acid. An\r\n       exactly similar result is obtained with hydrochloric acid, so that\r\n       its avidity with respect to soda is also double the avidity of\r\n       sulphuric acid. Experiments conducted with other acids showed that\r\n       not one of the acids investigated had so great an avidity as\r\n       nitric acid; some had a greater avidity than sulphuric acid,\r\n       others less, and in some instances the avidity = 0.' The reader\r\n       will naturally see clearly that the path chosen by Thomsen\r\n       deserves to be worked out, for his results concern important\r\n       questions of chemistry, but great faith cannot be placed in the\r\n       deductions he has already arrived at, because great complexity of\r\n       relations is to be seen in the very method of his investigation.\r\n       It is especially important to turn attention to the fact that all\r\n       the reactions investigated are reactions of double decomposition.\r\n       In them A and B do not combine with C and distribute themselves\r\n       according to their affinity or avidity for combination, but\r\n       reversible reactions are induced. MX and NY give MY and NX, and\r\n       conversely; therefore the affinity or avidity for combination is\r\n       not here directly determined, but only the difference or relation\r\n       of the affinities or avidities. The affinity of nitric acid not\r\n       only for the water of constitution, but also for that serving for\r\n       solution, is much less than that of sulphuric acid. This is seen\r\n       from thermal data. The reaction N_{2}O_{5} + H_{2}O gives +3,600\r\n       heat units, and the solution of the resultant hydrate, 2NHO_{3},\r\n       in a large excess of water evolves +14,986 heat units. The\r\n       formation of SO_{3} + H_{2}O evolves +21,308 heat units, and the\r\n       solution of H_{2}SO_{4} in an excess of water 17,860--that is,\r\n       sulphuric acid gives more heat in both cases. The interchange\r\n       between Na_{2}SO_{4} and 2HNO_{3} is not only accomplished at the\r\n       expense of the production of NaNO_{3}, but also at the expense of\r\n       the formation of H_{2}SO_{4}, hence the affinity of sulphuric acid\r\n       for water plays its part in the phenomena of displacement.\r\n       Therefore in determinations like those made by Thomsen the water\r\n       does not form a medium which is present without participating in\r\n       the process; it also takes part in the reaction. (Compare Chapter\r\n       IX., Note 14.)\r\n\r\n       Whilst retaining essentially the methods of Thomsen, Ostwald\r\n       (1876) determined the variation of the sp. gr. (and afterwards of\r\n       volume), proceeding in the same dilute solutions, on the\r\n       saturation of acids by bases, and in the decomposition of the\r\n       salts of one acid by the other, and arrived at conclusions of just\r\n       the same nature as Thomsen's. Ostwald's method will be clearly\r\n       understood from an example. A solution of caustic soda containing\r\n       an almost molecular (40 grams) weight per litre had a specific\r\n       gravity of 1·04051. The specific gravities of solutions of equal\r\n       volume and equivalent composition of sulphuric and nitric acids\r\n       were 1·02970 and 1·03084 respectively. On mixing the solutions of\r\n       NaHO and H_{2}SO_{4} there was formed a solution of Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n       of sp. gr. 1·02959; hence there ensued a decrease of specific\r\n       gravity which we will term Q, equal to 1·04051 +\r\n       1·02970-2(1·02959) = 0·01103. So also the specific gravity after\r\n       mixture of the solutions of NaHO and HNO_{3} was 1·02633, and\r\n       therefore Q = 0·01869. When one volume of the solution of nitric\r\n       acid was added to two volumes of the solution of sodium sulphate,\r\n       a solution of sp. gr. 1·02781 was obtained, and therefore the\r\n       resultant decrease of sp. gr.\r\n\r\n           Q_{1} = 2(1·02959) + 1·03084-3(1·02781) = 0·00659.\r\n\r\n       Had there been no chemical reaction between the salts, then\r\n       according to Ostwald's reasoning the specific gravity of the\r\n       solutions would not have changed, and if the nitric acid had\r\n       entirely displaced the sulphuric acid Q_{2} would be =\r\n       0·01869-0·01103 = 0·00766. It is evident that a portion of the\r\n       sulphuric acid was displaced by the nitric acid. But the measure\r\n       of displacement is not equal to the ratio between Q_{1} and Q_{2},\r\n       because a decrease of sp. gr. also occurs on mixing the solution\r\n       of sodium sulphate with sulphuric acid, whilst the mixing of the\r\n       solutions of sodium nitrate and nitric acid only produces a slight\r\n       variation of sp. gr. which falls within the limits of experimental\r\n       error. Ostwald deduces from similar data the same conclusions as\r\n       Thomsen, and thus reconfirms the formula deduced by Guldberg and\r\n       Waage, and the teaching of Berthollet.\r\n\r\n       The participation of water is seen still more clearly in the\r\n       methods adopted by Ostwald than in those of Thomsen, because in\r\n       the saturation of solutions of acids by alkalis (which Kremers,\r\n       Reinhold, and others had previously studied) there is observed,\r\n       not a contraction, as might have been expected from the quantity\r\n       of heat which is then evolved, but an expansion, of volume (a\r\n       decrease of specific gravity, if we calculate as Ostwald did in\r\n       his first investigations). Thus by mixing 1,880 grams of a\r\n       solution of sulphuric acid of the composition SO_{3} + 100H_{2}O,\r\n       occupying a volume of 1,815 c.c., with a corresponding quantity of\r\n       a solution 2(NaHO + 5H_{2}O), whose volume = 1,793 c.c., we obtain\r\n       not 3,608 but 3,633 c.c., an expansion of 25 c.c. per gram\r\n       molecule of the resulting salt, Na_{2}SO_{4}. It is the same in\r\n       other cases. Nitric and hydrochloric acids give a still greater\r\n       expansion than sulphuric acid, and potassium hydroxide than sodium\r\n       hydroxide, whilst a solution of ammonia gives a contraction. The\r\n       relation to water must be considered as the cause of these\r\n       phenomena. When sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid dissolve in\r\n       water they develop heat and give a vigorous contraction; the water\r\n       is separated from such solutions with great difficulty. After\r\n       mutual saturation they form the salt Na_{2}SO_{4}, which retains\r\n       the water but feebly and evolves but little heat with it, i.e., in\r\n       other words, has little affinity for water. In the saturation of\r\n       sulphuric acid by soda the water is, so to say, displaced from a\r\n       stable combination and passes into an unstable combination; hence\r\n       an expansion (decrease of sp. gr.) takes place. It is not the\r\n       reaction of the acid on the alkali, but the reaction of water,\r\n       that produces the phenomenon by which Ostwald desires to measure\r\n       the degree of salt formation. The water, which escaped attention,\r\n       itself has affinity, and influences those phenomena which are\r\n       being investigated. Furthermore, in the given instance its\r\n       influence is very great because its mass is large. When it is not\r\n       present, or only present in small quantities, the attraction of\r\n       the base to the acid leads to contraction, and not expansion.\r\n       Na_{2}O has a sp. gr. 2·8, hence its molecular volume = 22; the\r\n       sp. gr. of SO_{3} is 1·9 and volume 41, hence the sum of their\r\n       volumes is 63; for Na_{2}SO_{4} the sp. gr. is 2·65 and volume\r\n       53·6, consequently there is a contraction of 10 c.c. per\r\n       gram-molecule of salt. The volume of H_{2}SO_{4} = 53·3, that of\r\n       2NaHO = 37·4; there is produced 2H_{2}O, volume = 36, +\r\n       Na_{2}SO_{4}, volume = 53·6. There react 90·7 c.c., and on\r\n       saturation there result 89·6 c.c.; consequently contraction again\r\n       ensues, although less, and although this reaction is one of\r\n       substitution and not of combination. Consequently the phenomena\r\n       studied by Ostwald depend but little on the measure of the\r\n       reaction of the salts, and more on the relations of the dissolved\r\n       substances to water. In substitutions, for instance 2NaNO_{3} +\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4} = 2HNO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4}, the volumes vary but\r\n       slightly: in the above example they are 2(38·8) + 53·3 and 2(41·2)\r\n       + 53·6; hence 131 volumes act, and 136 volumes are produced. It\r\n       may be concluded, therefore, on the basis of what has been said,\r\n       that on taking water into consideration the phenomena studied by\r\n       Thomsen and Ostwald are much more complex than they at first\r\n       appear, and that this method can scarcely lead to a correct\r\n       interpretation as to the distribution of acids between bases. We\r\n       may add that P. D. Chroustcheff (1890) introduced a new method for\r\n       this class of research, by investigating the electro-conductivity\r\n       of solutions and their mixtures, and obtained remarkable results\r\n       (for example, that hydrochloric acid almost entirely displaces\r\n       formic acid and only 2/3 of sulphuric acid), but details of these\r\n       methods must be looked for in text-books of theoretical\r\n       chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [28] G. G. Gustavson's researches, which were conducted in the\r\n       laboratory of the St. Petersburg University in 1871-72, are among\r\n       the first in which the measure of the affinity of the elements for\r\n       the halogens is recognised with perfect clearness in the limit of\r\n       substitution and in the rate of reaction. The researches conducted\r\n       by A. L. Potilitzin (of which mention will be made in Chapter XI.,\r\n       Note 66) in the same laboratory touch on another aspect of the\r\n       same problem which has not yet made much progress, notwithstanding\r\n       its importance and the fact that the theoretical side of the\r\n       subject (thanks especially to Guldberg and Van't Hoff) has since\r\n       been rapidly pushed forward. If the researches of Gustavson took\r\n       account of the influence of mass, and were more fully supplied\r\n       with data concerning velocities and temperatures, they would be\r\n       very important, because of the great significance which the case\r\n       considered has for the understanding of double saline\r\n       decompositions in the absence of water.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore Gustavson showed that the greater the atomic weight of\r\n       the element (B, Si, Ti, As, Sn) combined _with chlorine_ the\r\n       greater the amount of chlorine replaced by bromine by the action\r\n       of CBr_{4}, and consequently the less the amount of bromine\r\n       replaced by chlorine by the action of CCl_{4} on bromine\r\n       compounds. For instance, for chlorine compounds the percentage of\r\n       substitution (at the limit) is--\r\n\r\n             BCl_{3}   SiCl_{4}   TiCl_{4}   AsCl_{3}   SnCl_{4}\r\n              10·1       12·5       43·6       71·8       77·5\r\n\r\n       It should he observed, however, that Thorpe, on the basis of his\r\n       experiments, denies the universality of this conclusion. I may\r\n       mention one conclusion which it appears to me may be drawn from\r\n       the above-cited figures of Gustavson, if they are subsequently\r\n       verified even within narrow limits. If CBr_{4} be heated with\r\n       RCl_{4}, then an exchange of the bromine for chlorine takes place.\r\n       But what would be the result if it were mixed with CCl_{4}?\r\n       Judging by the magnitude of the atomic weights, B = 11, C = 12, Si\r\n       = 28, about 11 p.c. of the chlorine would be replaced by bromine.\r\n       But to what does this point? I think that this shows the existence\r\n       of a motion of the atoms in the molecule. The mixture of CCl_{4}\r\n       and CBr_{4} does not remain in a condition of static equilibrium;\r\n       not only are the molecules contained in it in a state of motion,\r\n       but also the atoms in the molecules, and the above figures show\r\n       the measure of their translation under these conditions. The\r\n       bromine in the CBr_{4} is, _within the limit_, substituted by the\r\n       chlorine of the CCl_{4} in a quantity of about 11 out of 100: that\r\n       is, a portion of the atoms of bromine previously to this moment in\r\n       combination with one atom of carbon pass over to the other atom of\r\n       carbon, and the chlorine passes over from this second atom of\r\n       carbon to replace it. Therefore, also, in the homogeneous mass\r\n       CCl_{4} all the atoms of Cl do not remain constantly combined with\r\n       the same atoms of carbon, and _there is on exchange of atoms\r\n       between different molecules in a homogeneous medium also_. This\r\n       hypothesis may in my opinion explain certain phenomena of\r\n       dissociation, but though mentioning it I do not consider it worth\r\n       while to dwell upon it. I will only observe that a similar\r\n       hypothesis suggested itself to me in my researches on solutions,\r\n       and that Pfaundler enunciated an essentially similar hypothesis,\r\n       and in recent times a like view is beginning to find favour with\r\n       respect to the electrolysis of saline solutions.\r\n\r\nThus we now find ample confirmation from various quarters for the\r\nfollowing rules of Berthollet, applying them to double saline\r\ndecompositions: 1. From two salts MX and NY containing different haloids\r\nand metals there result from their reaction two others, MY and NX, but\r\nsuch a substitution will not proceed to the end unless one product passes\r\nfrom the sphere of action. 2. This reaction is limited by the existence\r\nof an equilibrium between MX, NY, MY, and NX, because a reverse reaction\r\nis quite as possible as the direct reaction. 3. This limit is determined\r\nboth by the measure of the active affinities and by the relative masses\r\nof the substances as measured by the number of the reacting molecules. 4.\r\nOther conditions being constant, the chemical action is proportional to\r\nthe product of the chemical masses in action.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Berthollet's doctrine is hardly at all affected in principle by\r\n       showing that there are cases in which there is no decomposition\r\n       between salts, because the affinity may be so small that even a\r\n       large mass would still give no observable displacements. The\r\n       fundamental condition for the application of Berthollet's\r\n       doctrine, as well as Deville's doctrine of dissociation, lies in\r\n       the reversibility of reactions. There are practically irreversible\r\n       reactions (for instance, CCl_{4} + 2H_{2}O = CO_{2} + 4HCl), just\r\n       as there are non-volatile substances. But while accepting the\r\n       doctrine of reversible reactions and retaining the theory of the\r\n       evaporation of liquids, it is possible to admit the existence of\r\n       non-volatile substances, and in just the same way of reactions,\r\n       without any visible conformity to Berthollet's doctrine. This\r\n       doctrine evidently comes nearer than the opposite doctrine of\r\n       Bergmann to solving the complex problems of chemical mechanics for\r\n       the successful solution of which at the present time the most\r\n       valuable help is to be expected from the working out of data\r\n       concerning dissociation, the influence of mass, and the\r\n       equilibrium and velocity of reactions. But it is evident that from\r\n       this point of view we must not regard a solvent as a\r\n       non-participant space, but must take into consideration the\r\n       chemical reactions accompanying solution, or else bring about\r\n       reactions without solution.\r\n\r\nThus if the salts MX and NY after reaction partly formed salts MY and NX,\r\nthen a state of equilibrium is reached and the reaction ceases; but if\r\none of the resultant compounds, in virtue of its physical properties,\r\npasses from the sphere of action of the remaining substances, then the\r\nreaction will continue. This exit from the sphere of action depends on\r\nthe physical properties of the substance and on the conditions under\r\nwhich the reaction takes place. Thus, for instance, the salt NX may, in\r\nthe case of reaction between solutions, separate as a precipitate, an\r\ninsoluble substance, while the other three substances remain in solution,\r\nor it may pass into vapour, and in this manner also pass away from the\r\nsphere of action of the remaining substances. Let us now suppose that it\r\npasses away in some form or other from the sphere of action of the\r\nremaining substances--for instance, that it is transformed into a\r\nprecipitate or vapour--then a fresh reaction will set in and a\r\nre-formation of the salt NX. If this be removed, then, although the\r\nquantity of the elements N and X in the mass will be diminished, still,\r\naccording to Berthollet's law, a certain amount of NX should be again\r\nformed. When this substance is again formed, then, owing to its physical\r\nproperties, it will again pass away; hence the reaction, in consequence\r\nof the physical properties of the resultant substances, is able to\r\nproceed to completion notwithstanding the possible weakness of the\r\nattraction existing between the elements entering into the composition of\r\nthe resultant substance NX. Naturally, if the resultant substance is\r\nformed of elements having a considerable degree of affinity, then the\r\ncomplete decomposition is considerably facilitated.\r\n\r\nSuch a representation of the _modus operandi_ of chemical\r\ntransformations is applicable with great clearness to a number of\r\nreactions studied in chemistry, and, what is especially important, the\r\napplication of this aspect of Berthollet's teaching does not in any way\r\nrequire the determination of the measure of affinity acting between the\r\nsubstances present. For instance, the action of ammonia on solutions of\r\nsalts; the displacement, by its means, of basic hydrates insoluble in\r\nwater; the separation of volatile nitric acid by the aid of non-volatile\r\nsulphuric acid, as well as the decomposition of common salt by means of\r\nsulphuric acid, when gaseous hydrochloric acid is formed--may be taken\r\nas examples of reactions which proceed to the end, inasmuch as one of\r\nthe resultant substances is entirely removed from the sphere of action,\r\nbut they in no way indicate the measure of affinity.[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Common salt not only enters into double decomposition with acids\r\n       but also _with every salt_. However, as clearly follows from\r\n       Berthollet's doctrine, this form of decomposition will only in a\r\n       few cases render it possible for new metallic chlorides to be\r\n       obtained, because the decomposition will not be carried on to the\r\n       end unless the metallic chloride formed separates from the mass of\r\n       the active substances. Thus, for example, if a solution of common\r\n       salt be mixed with a solution of magnesium sulphate, double\r\n       decomposition ensues, but not completely, because all the\r\n       substances remain in the solution. In this case the decomposition\r\n       must result in the formation of sodium sulphate and magnesium\r\n       chloride, substances which are soluble in water; nothing is\r\n       disengaged, and therefore the decomposition 2NaCl + MgSO_{4} =\r\n       MgCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4} cannot proceed to the end. However, the\r\n       sodium sulphate formed in this manner may be separated by freezing\r\n       the mixture. The complete separation of the sodium sulphate will\r\n       naturally not take place, owing to a portion of the salt remaining\r\n       in the solution. Nevertheless, this kind of decomposition is made\r\n       use of for the preparation of sodium sulphate from the residues\r\n       left after the evaporation of sea-water, which contain a mixture\r\n       of magnesium sulphate and common salt. Such a mixture is found at\r\n       Stassfurt in a natural form. It might be said that this form of\r\n       double decomposition is only accomplished with a change of\r\n       temperature; but this would not be true, as may be concluded from\r\n       other analogous cases. Thus, for instance, a solution of copper\r\n       sulphate is of a blue colour, while a solution of copper chloride\r\n       is green. If we mix the two salts together the green tint is\r\n       distinctly visible, so that by this means the presence of the\r\n       copper chloride in the solution of copper sulphate is clearly\r\n       seen. If now we add a solution of common salt to a solution of\r\n       copper sulphate, a green coloration is obtained, which indicates\r\n       the formation of copper chloride. In this instance it is not\r\n       separated, but it is immediately formed on the addition of common\r\n       salt, as it should be according to Berthollet's doctrine.\r\n\r\n       The complete formation of a metallic chloride from common salt can\r\n       only occur, judging from the above, when it separates from the\r\n       sphere of action. The salts of silver are instances in point,\r\n       because the silver chloride is insoluble in water; and therefore\r\n       if we add a solution of sodium chloride to a solution of a silver\r\n       salt, silver chloride and the sodium salt of that acid which was\r\n       in the silver salt are formed.\r\n\r\nAs a proof that double decompositions like the above are actually\r\naccomplished in the sense of Berthollet's doctrine, the fact may be cited\r\nthat common salt may be entirely decomposed by nitric acid, and nitre may\r\nbe completely decomposed by hydrochloric acid, just as they are\r\ndecomposed by sulphuric acid; but this only takes place when, in the\r\nfirst instance, an excess of nitric acid is taken, and in the second\r\ninstance, an excess of hydrochloric acid, for a given quantity of the\r\nsodium salt, and when the resultant acid passes off. If sodium chloride\r\nbe put into a porcelain evaporating basin, nitric acid added to it, and\r\nthe mixture heated, then both hydrochloric and nitric acids are expelled\r\nby the heat. Thus the nitric acid partially acts on the sodium chloride,\r\nbut on heating, as both acids are volatile, they are both converted into\r\nvapour; and therefore the residue will contain a mixture of a certain\r\nquantity of the sodium chloride taken and of the sodium nitrate formed.\r\nIf a fresh quantity of nitric acid be then added, reaction will again set\r\nin, a certain portion of hydrochloric acid is again evolved, and on\r\nheating is expelled together with nitric acid. If this be repeated\r\nseveral times, it is possible to expel all the hydrochloric acid, and to\r\nobtain sodium nitrate only in the residue. If, on the contrary, we take\r\nsodium nitrate and add hydrochloric acid to it in an aqueous solution, a\r\ncertain quantity of the hydrochloric acid displaces a portion of the\r\nnitric acid, and on heating the excess of hydrochloric acid passes away\r\nwith the nitric acid formed. On repeating this process, it is possible to\r\ndisplace the nitric acid with an excess of hydrochloric acid, just as it\r\nwas possible to displace the hydrochloric acid by an excess of nitric\r\nacid. The influence of the mass of the substance in action and the\r\ninfluence of volatility are here very distinctly seen. Hence it may be\r\naffirmed that sulphuric acid does not displace hydrochloric acid because\r\nof an especially high degree of affinity, but that this reaction is only\r\ncarried on to the end because the sulphuric acid is not volatile, whilst\r\nthe hydrochloric acid which is formed is volatile.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of hydrochloric acid in the laboratory and on a large\r\nscale is based upon these data. In the first instance, an excess of\r\nsulphuric acid is employed in order that the reaction may proceed easily\r\nat a low temperature, whilst on a large scale, when it is necessary to\r\neconomise every material, equivalent quantities are taken in order to\r\nobtain the normal salt Na_{2}SO_{4} and not the acid salt, which would\r\nrequire twice as much acid. The hydrochloric acid evolved is a gas which\r\nis very soluble in water. It is most frequently used in practice in this\r\nstate of solution under the name of _muriatic acid_.[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] The apparatus shown in fig. 46 (Chapter VI., Note 12) is generally\r\n       employed for the preparation of small quantities of hydrochloric\r\n       acid. Common salt is placed in the retort; the salt is generally\r\n       previously fused, as it otherwise froths and boils over in the\r\n       apparatus. When the apparatus is placed in order sulphuric acid\r\n       mixed with water is poured down the thistle funnel into the\r\n       retort. Strong sulphuric acid (about half as much again as the\r\n       weight of the salt) is usually taken, and it is diluted with a\r\n       small quantity of water (half) if it be desired to retard the\r\n       action, as in using strong sulphuric acid the action immediately\r\n       begins with great vigour. The mixture, at first without the aid of\r\n       heat and then at a moderate temperature (in a water-bath), evolves\r\n       hydrochloric acid. Commercial hydrochloric acid contains many\r\n       impurities; it is usually purified by distillation, the middle\r\n       portions being collected. It is purified from arsenic by adding\r\n       FeCl_{2}, distilling, and rejecting the first third of the\r\n       distillate. If free hydrochloric acid gas be required, it is\r\n       passed through a vessel containing strong sulphuric acid to dry\r\n       it, and is collected over a mercury hath.\r\n\r\n       Phosphoric anhydride absorbs hydrogen chloride (Bailey and Fowler,\r\n       1888; 2P_{2}O_{3} + 3HCl = POCl_{3} + 3HPO_{3}) at the ordinary\r\n       temperature, and therefore the gas cannot he dried by this\r\n       substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Section of a salt-cake furnace. B, pan in which\r\nthe sodium chloride and sulphuric acid are first mixed and heated. C,\r\nmuffle for the ultimate decomposition.]\r\n\r\nIn chemical works the decomposition of sodium chloride by means of\r\nsulphuric acid is carried on on a very large scale, chiefly with a\r\nview to the preparation of normal sodium sulphate, the hydrochloric\r\nacid being a bye-product.[31 bis] The furnace employed is termed a\r\n_salt cake furnace_. It is represented in fig. 65, and consists of the\r\nfollowing two parts: the pan B and the roaster C, or enclosed space\r\nbuilt up of large bricks _a_ and enveloped on all sides by the smoke\r\nand flames from the fire grate, F. The ultimate decomposition of the\r\nsalt by the sulphuric acid is accomplished in the roaster. But the first\r\ndecomposition of sodium chloride by sulphuric acid does not require\r\nso high a temperature as the ultimate decomposition, and is therefore\r\ncarried on in the front and cooler portion, B, whose bottom is heated by\r\ngas flues. When the reaction in this portion ceases and the evolution of\r\nhydrochloric acid stops, then the mass, which contains about half of the\r\nsodium chloride still undecomposed, and the sulphuric acid in the form\r\nof acid sodium sulphate, is removed from B and thrown into the roaster\r\nC, where the action is completed. Normal sodium sulphate, which we\r\nshall afterwards describe, remains in the roaster. It is employed both\r\ndirectly in the manufacture of glass, and in the preparation of other\r\nsodium compounds--for instance, in the preparation of soda ash, as will\r\nafterwards be described. For the present we will only turn our attention\r\nto the hydrochloric acid evolved in B and C.\r\n\r\n  [31 bis] In chemical works where sulphuric acid of 60° Baumé (22 p.c.\r\n       of water) is employed, 117 parts of sodium chloride are taken to\r\n       about 125 parts of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid gas evolved is subjected to condensation by\r\ndissolving it in water.[32] If the apparatus in which the decomposition\r\nis accomplished were hermetically closed, and only presented one outlet,\r\nthen the escape of the hydrochloric acid would only proceed through the\r\nescape pipe intended for this purpose. But as it is impossible to\r\nconstruct a perfectly hermetically closed furnace of this kind, it is\r\nnecessary to increase the draught by artificial means, or to oblige the\r\nhydrochloric acid gas to pass through those arrangements in which it is\r\nto be condensed. This is done by connecting the ends of the tubes through\r\nwhich the hydrochloric acid gas escapes from the furnace with high\r\nchimneys, where a strong draught is set up from the combustion of the\r\nfuel. This causes a current of hydrochloric acid gas to pass through the\r\nabsorbing apparatus in a definite direction. Here it encounters a current\r\nof water flowing in the opposite direction, by which it is absorbed. It\r\nis not customary to cause the acid to pass through the water, but only to\r\nbring it into contact with the surface of the water. The absorption\r\napparatus consists of large earthenware vessels having four orifices, two\r\nabove and two lateral ones in the wide central portion of each vessel.\r\nThe upper orifices serve for connecting the vessels together, and the\r\nhydrochloric acid gas escaping from the furnace passes through these\r\ntubes. The water for absorbing the acid enters at the upper, and flows\r\nout from the lower, vessel, passing through the lateral orifices in the\r\nvessels. The water flows from the chimney towards the furnace and it is\r\ntherefore evident that the outflowing water will be the most saturated\r\nwith acid, of which it actually contains about 20 per cent. The\r\nabsorption in these vessels is not complete. The ultimate absorption of\r\nthe hydrochloric acid is carried on in the so-called _coke towers_, which\r\nusually consist of two adjacent chimneys. A lattice-work of bricks is\r\nlaid on the bottom of these towers, on which coke is piled up to the top\r\nof the tower. Water, distributing itself over the coke, trickles down to\r\nthe bottom of the tower, and in so doing absorbs the hydrochloric acid\r\ngas rising upwards.\r\n\r\n  [32] As in works which treat common salt in order to obtain sodium\r\n       sulphate, the hydrochloric acid is sometimes held to be of no\r\n       value, it might be allowed to escape with the waste furnace gases\r\n       into the atmosphere, which would greatly injure the air of the\r\n       neighbourhood and destroy all vegetation. In all countries,\r\n       therefore, there are laws forbidding the factories to proceed in\r\n       this manner, and requiring the absorption of the hydrochloric acid\r\n       by water at the works themselves, and not permitting the solution\r\n       to be run into rivers and streams, whose waters it would spoil. It\r\n       may be remarked that the absorption of hydrochloric acid presents\r\n       no particular difficulties (the absorption of sulphurous acid is\r\n       much more difficult) because hydrochloric acid has a great\r\n       affinity for water and gives a hydrate which boils above 100°.\r\n       Hence, even steam and hot water, as well as weaker solutions, can\r\n       be used for absorbing the acid. However, Warder (1888) showed that\r\n       weak solutions of composition H_{2}O + _n_HCl when boiled (the\r\n       residue will be almost HCl,8H_{2}O) evolve (not water but) a\r\n       solution of the composition H_{2}O + 445_n_^{4}HCl; for example,\r\n       on distilling HCl,10H_{2}O, HCl,23H_{2}O is first obtained in the\r\n       distillate. As the strength of the residue becomes greater, so\r\n       also does that of the distillate, and therefore in order to\r\n       completely absorb hydrochloric acid it is necessary in the end to\r\n       have recourse to water.\r\n\r\n       As in Russia the manufacture of sodium sulphate from sodium\r\n       chloride has not yet been sufficiently developed, and as\r\n       hydrochloric acid is required for many technical purposes (for\r\n       instance, for the preparation of zinc chloride, which is employed\r\n       for soaking railway sleepers), therefore salt is often treated\r\n       mainly for the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that hydrochloric acid may be obtained\r\nfrom all other metallic chlorides.[33] It is frequently formed in other\r\nreactions, many of which we shall meet with in the further course of\r\nthis work. It is, for instance, formed by the action of water on sulphur\r\nchloride, phosphorus chloride, antimony chloride, &c.\r\n\r\n  [33] Thus the metallic chlorides, which are decomposed to a greater or\r\n       less degree by water, correspond with feeble bases. Such are, for\r\n       example, MgCl_{2}, AlCl_{3}, SbCl_{3}, BiCl_{3}. The decomposition\r\n       of magnesium chloride (and also carnallite) by sulphuric acid\r\n       proceeds at the ordinary temperature; water decomposes MgCl_{2} to\r\n       the extent of 50 p.c. when aided by heat, and _may be employed_ as\r\n       a convenient _method for the production of hydrochloric acid_.\r\n       Hydrochloric acid is also produced by the ignition of certain\r\n       metallic chlorides in a stream of hydrogen, especially of those\r\n       metals which are easily reduced and difficultly oxidised--for\r\n       instance, silver chloride. Lead chloride, when heated to redness\r\n       in a current of steam, gives hydrochloric acid and lead oxide. The\r\n       multitude of the cases of formation of hydrochloric acid are\r\n       understood from the fact that it is a substance which is\r\n       comparatively very stable, resembling water in this respect, and\r\n       even most probably more stable than water, because, at a high\r\n       temperature and even under the action of light, chlorine\r\n       decomposes water, with the formation of hydrochloric acid. The\r\n       combination of chlorine and hydrogen also proceeds by their direct\r\n       action, as we shall afterwards describe.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric acid_ is a colourless gas having a pungent suffocating\r\nodour and an acid taste. This gas fumes in air and attracts moisture,\r\nbecause it forms vapour containing a compound of hydrochloric acid and\r\nwater. Hydrochloric acid is liquefied by cold, and under a pressure of\r\n40 atmospheres, into a colourless liquid of sp. gr. 0·908 at 0°,[34]\r\nboiling point -35° and absolute boiling point +52°. We have already\r\nseen (Chapter I.) that hydrochloric acid combines very energetically\r\n_with water_, and in so doing evolves a considerable amount of heat.\r\nThe solution saturated in the cold attains a density 1·23. On heating\r\nsuch a solution containing about 45 parts of acid per 100 parts, the\r\nhydrochloric acid gas is expelled with only a slight admixture of\r\naqueous vapour. But it is impossible to entirely separate the whole of\r\nthe hydrochloric acid from the water by this means, as could be done\r\nin the case of an ammoniacal solution. The temperature required for\r\nthe evolution of the gas rises and reaches 110°-111°, and after this\r\nremains constant--that is, a solution having a constant boiling point\r\nis obtained (as with HNO_{3}), which, however, does not (Roscoe and\r\nDittmar) present a constant composition under different pressures,\r\nbecause the hydrate is decomposed in distillation, as is seen from the\r\ndeterminations of its vapour density (Bineau). Judging from the facts\r\n(1) that with decrease of the pressure under which the distillation\r\nproceeds the solution of constant boiling point approaches to a\r\ncomposition of 25 p.c. of hydrochloric acid,[35] (2) that by passing\r\na stream of dry air through a solution of hydrochloric acid there is\r\nobtained in the residue a solution which also approaches to 25 p.c. of\r\nacid, and more nearly as the temperature falls,[36] (3) that many of the\r\nproperties of solutions of hydrochloric acid vary distinctly according\r\nas they contain more or less than 25 p.c. of hydrochloric acid (for\r\ninstance, antimonious sulphide gives hydrogen sulphide with a stronger\r\nacid, but is not acted on by a weaker solution, also a stronger solution\r\nfumes in the air, &c.), and (4) that the composition HCl,6H_{2}O\r\ncorresponds with 25·26 p.c. HCl--judging from all these data, and also\r\nfrom the loss of tension which occurs in the combination of hydrochloric\r\nacid with water, it may be said that they form a _definite hydrate_ of\r\nthe composition HCl,6H_{2}O. Besides this hydrate there exists also a\r\ncrystallo-hydrate, HCl,2H_{2}O,[37] which is formed by the absorption of\r\nhydrochloric acid by a saturated solution at a temperature of -23°. It\r\ncrystallises and melts at -18°.[38]\r\n\r\n  [34] According to Ansdell (1880) the sp. gr. of liquid hydrochloric\r\n       acid at 0° = 0·908, at 11·67° = 0·854, at 22·7° = 0·808, at 33° =\r\n       0·748. Hence it is seen that the expansion of this liquid is\r\n       greater than that of gases (Chapter II., Note 34).\r\n\r\n  [35] According to Roscoe and Dittmar at a pressure of three atmospheres\r\n       the solution of constant boiling point contains 18 p.c. of\r\n       hydrogen chloride, and at a pressure of one-tenth atmosphere 23\r\n       p.c. The percentage is intermediate at medium pressures.\r\n\r\n  [36] At 0° 25 p.c., at 100° 20·7 p.c.; Roscoe and Dittmar.\r\n\r\n  [37] This crystallo-hydrate (obtained by Pierre and Puchot, and\r\n       investigated by Roozeboom) is analogous to NaCl,2H_{2}O. The\r\n       crystals HCl,2H_{2}O at -22° have a specific gravity 1·46; the\r\n       vapour tension (under dissociation) of the solution having a\r\n       composition HCl,2H_{2}O at -24° = 760, at -19° = 1,010, at -18° =\r\n       1,057, at -17° = 1,112 mm. of mercury. In a solid state the\r\n       crystallo-hydrate at -17·7° has the same tension, whilst at lower\r\n       temperatures it is much less: at -24° about 150, at -19° about 580\r\n       mm. A mixture of fuming hydrochloric acid with snow reduces the\r\n       temperature to -38°. If another equivalent of water be added to the\r\n       hydrate HCl,2H_{2}O at -18°, the temperature of solidification\r\n       falls to -25°, and the hydrate HCl,3H_{2}O is formed (Pickering,\r\n       1893).\r\n\r\n  [38] According to Roscoe at 0° one _hundred_ grams of water at a\r\n       pressure _p_ (in millimetres of mercury) dissolves--\r\n\r\n                   _p_ = 100   200   300   500   700   1,000\r\n             Grams HCl   65·7  70·7  73·8  78·2  81·7  85·6\r\n\r\n       At a pressure of 760 millimetres and temperature _t_, one\r\n       _hundred_ grams of water dissolves\r\n\r\n                   _t_ =  0     8°   16°   24°   40°   60°\r\n             Grams HCl   82·5  78·3  74·2  70·0  63·3  56·1\r\n\r\n       Roozeboom (1886) showed that at _t_° solutions containing _c_\r\n       grams of hydrogen chloride per 100 grams of water may (with the\r\n       variation of the pressure _p_) be formed together with the\r\n       crystallo-hydrate HCl,2H_{2}O:\r\n\r\n             _t_ = -28°·8  -21°   -19°   -18°   -17°·7\r\n             _c_ =  84·2    86·8   92·6   98·4   101·4\r\n             _p_ =   --     334    580    900    1,073  mm.\r\n\r\n       The last combination answers to the melted crystallo-hydrate\r\n       HCl,2H_{2}O, which splits up at temperatures above -17°·7, and at\r\n       a constant atmospheric pressure when there are no crystals--\r\n\r\n                   _t_ =  -24°  -21°  -18°  -10°    0°\r\n                   _c_ =  101·2  98·3  95·7  89·8  84·2\r\n\r\n       From these data it is seen that the hydrate HCl,2H_{2}O can exist\r\n       in a liquid state, which is not the case for the hydrates of\r\n       carbonic and sulphurous anhydrides, chlorine, &c.\r\n\r\n       According to Marignac, the specific heat _c_ of a solution HCl +\r\n       _m_H_{2}O (at about 30°, taking the specific heat of water = 1) is\r\n       given by the expression--\r\n\r\n          C(36·5 + _m_18) = 18_m_ - 28·39 + 140/_m_ - 268/_m_^2\r\n\r\n       if _m_ be not less than 6·25. For example, for HCl + 25H_{2}O,\r\n       C = 0·877.\r\n\r\n       According to Thomsen's data, the amount of heat _Q_, expressed in\r\n       thousands of calories, evolved in the solution of 36·5 grams of\r\n       gaseous hydrochloric acid in _m_H_{2}O or 18_m_ grams of water is\r\n       equal to--\r\n\r\n                   _m_ =  2     4    10    50    400\r\n                   _Q_ = 11·4  14·3  16·2  17·1   17·3\r\n\r\n       In these quantities the latent heat of liquefaction is included,\r\n       which must be taken as 5-9 thousand calories per molecular\r\n       quantity of hydrogen chloride.\r\n\r\n       The researches of Scheffer (1888) on the rate of diffusion (in\r\n       water) of solutions of hydrochloric acid show that the coefficient\r\n       of diffusion _k_ decreases with the amount of water _n_, if the\r\n       composition of the solution is HCl,_n_H_{2}O at 0°:--\r\n\r\n               _n_ = 5     6·9   9·8   14    27·1  129·5\r\n               _k_ = 2·31  2·08  1·86   1·67  1·52   1·39\r\n\r\n       It also appears that strong solutions diffuse more rapidly into\r\n       dilute solutions than into water.\r\n\r\nThe mean specific gravities at 15°, taking water at its maximum density\r\n(4°) as 10,000, for solutions containing _p_ per cent. of hydrogen\r\nchloride are--\r\n\r\n                     _p_    _S_         _p_    _S_\r\n                      5   10,242        25   11,266\r\n                     10   10,490        30   11,522\r\n                     15   10,744        35   11,773\r\n                     20   11,001        40   11,997\r\n\r\nThe formula _S_ = 9,991·6 + 49·43_p_ + 0·0571_p_^2, up to _p_ =\r\n25·26, which answers to the hydrate HCl,6H_{2}O mentioned above,\r\ngives the specific gravity. Above this percentage _S_ = 9,785·1 +\r\n65·10_p_-0·240_p_^2. The rise of specific gravity with an increase\r\nof percentage (or the differential _ds/dp_) reaches a maximum at\r\nabout 25 p.c.[39] The intermediate solution, HCl,6H_{2}O, is further\r\ndistinguished by the fact that the variation of the specific gravity\r\nwith the variation of temperature is a constant quantity, so that the\r\nspecific gravity of this solution is equal to 11,352·7(1-0·000447_t_),\r\nwhere 0·000447 is the coefficient of expansion of the solution.[40]\r\nIn the case of more dilute solutions, as with water, the specific\r\ngravity per 1° (or the differential _ds_/_dt_) rises with a rise of\r\ntemperature.[41]\r\n\r\n                             _p_ =  0      5   10   15   20\r\n              _S__{0} - _S__{15} =  7·2   23   38   52   64\r\n             _S__{15} - _S__{30} = 34·1   42   50   59   67\r\n\r\nWhilst for solutions which contain a greater proportion of hydrogen\r\nchloride than HCl,6H_{2}O, these coefficients _decrease_ with a\r\nrise of temperature; for instance, for 30 p.c. of hydrogen chloride\r\n_S__{0}-_S__{15} = 88 and _S__{15}-_S__{30} = 87 (according to\r\nMarignac's data). In the case of HCl,6H_{2}O these differences are\r\nconstant, and equal 76.\r\n\r\n  [39] If it be admitted that the maximum of the differential corresponds\r\n       with HCl,6H_{2}O, then it might be thought that the specific\r\n       gravity is expressed by a parabola of the third order; but such an\r\n       admission does not give expressions in accordance with fact. This\r\n       is all more fully considered in my work mentioned in Chapter I.,\r\n       Note 19.\r\n\r\n  [40] As in water, the coefficient of expansion (or the quantity _k_ in\r\n       the expression S_{_t_} = S_{_0_}-_k_S_{_0_}_t_, or V_t_ =\r\n       1/(1-_kt_)) attains a magnitude 0·000447 at about 48°, it might be\r\n       thought that at 48° all solutions of hydrochloric acid would have\r\n       the same coefficient of expansion, but in reality this is not the\r\n       case. At low and at the ordinary temperatures the coefficient of\r\n       expansion of aqueous solutions is greater than that of water, and\r\n       increases with the amount of substance dissolved.\r\n\r\n  [41] The figures cited above may serve for the direct determination of\r\n       that variation of the specific gravity of solutions of\r\n       hydrochloric acid with the temperature. Thus, knowing that at 15°\r\n       the specific gravity of a 10 p.c. solution of hydrochloric acid =\r\n       10,492, we find that at _t_° it = 10,530-_t_(2·13 + 0·027_t_).\r\n       Whence also may be found the coefficient of expansion (Note 40).\r\n\r\nThus the formation of two definite hydrates, HCl,2H_{2}O and HCl,6H_{2}O,\r\nbetween hydrochloric acid and water may be accepted upon the basis of\r\nmany facts. But both of them, if they occur in a liquid state, dissociate\r\nwith great facility into hydrogen chloride and water, and are completely\r\ndecomposed when distilled.\r\n\r\nAll solutions of hydrochloric acid present the properties of an\r\nenergetic acid. They not only transform blue vegetable colouring matter\r\ninto red, and disengage carbonic acid gas from carbonates, &c., but\r\nthey also entirely saturate bases, even such energetic ones as potash,\r\nlime, &c. In a dry state, however, hydrochloric acid does not alter\r\nvegetable dyes, and does not effect many double decompositions which\r\neasily take place in the presence of water. This is explained by the\r\nfact that the gaso-elastic state of the hydrochloric acid prevents its\r\nentering into reaction. However, incandescent iron, zinc, sodium, &c.,\r\nact on gaseous hydrochloric acid, displacing the hydrogen and leaving\r\nhalf a volume of hydrogen for each volume of hydrochloric acid gas; this\r\nreaction may serve for determining the composition of hydrochloric acid.\r\nCombined with water hydrochloric acid acts as an acid much resembling\r\nnitric acid[42] in its energy and in many of its reactions; however, the\r\nlatter contains oxygen, which is disengaged with great ease, and so very\r\nfrequently acts as an oxidiser, which hydrochloric acid is not capable\r\nof doing. The majority of metals (even those which do not displace the\r\nH from H_{2}SO_{4}, but which, like copper, decompose it to the limit\r\nof SO_{2}) displace the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid. Thus hydrogen\r\nis disengaged by the action of zinc, and even of copper and tin.[42 bis]\r\nOnly a few metals withstand its action; for example, gold and\r\nplatinum. Lead in compact masses is only acted on feebly, because the\r\nlead chloride formed is insoluble and prevents the further action of the\r\nacid on the metal. The same is to be remarked with respect to the feeble\r\naction of hydrochloric acid on mercury and silver, because the compounds\r\nof these metals, AgCl and HgCl, are insoluble in water. Metallic\r\nchlorides are not only formed by the action of hydrochloric acid on the\r\nmetals, but also by many other methods; for instance, by the action of\r\nhydrochloric acid on the carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides, and also\r\nby the action of chlorine on metals and certain of their compounds.\r\nMetallic chlorides have a composition MCl; for example, NaCl, KCl,\r\nAgCl, HgCl, if the metal replaces hydrogen equivalent for equivalent,\r\nor, as it is said, if it be monatomic or univalent. In the case of\r\nbivalent metals, they have a composition MCl_{2}; for example, CaCl_{2},\r\nCuCl_{2}, PbCl_{2}, HgCl_{2}, FeCl_{2}, MnCl_{2}. The composition of\r\nthe haloid salts of other metals presents a further variation; for\r\nexample, AlCl_{3}, PtCl_{4}, &c. Many metals, for instance Fe, give\r\nseveral degrees of combination with chlorine (FeCl_{2}, FeCl_{3}) as\r\nwith hydrogen. In their composition the metallic chlorides differ\r\nfrom the corresponding oxides, in that the O is replaced by Cl_{2},\r\nas should follow from the law of substitution, because oxygen gives\r\nOH_{2}, and is consequently bivalent, whilst chlorine forms HCl, and is\r\ntherefore univalent. So, for instance, ferrous oxide, FeO, corresponds\r\nwith ferrous chloride, FeCl_{2}, and the oxide Fe_{2}O_{3} with ferric\r\nchloride, which is also seen from the origin of these compounds, for\r\nFeCl_{2} is obtained by the action of hydrochloric acid on ferrous\r\noxide or carbonate and FeCl_{3} by its action on ferric oxide. In a\r\nword, all the typical properties of acids are shown by hydrochloric\r\nacid, and all the typical properties of salts in the metallic chlorides\r\nderived from it. Acids and salts composed like HCl and M_{n}Cl_{2m}\r\nwithout any oxygen bear the name of haloid salts; for instance, HCl is\r\na haloid acid, NaCl a haloid salt, chlorine a halogen. The capacity\r\nof hydrochloric acid to give, by its action on bases, MO, a metallic\r\nchloride, MCl_{2}, and water, is limited at high temperatures by the\r\nreverse reaction MCl_{2} + H_{2}O = MO + 2HCl, and the more pronounced\r\nare the basic properties of MO the feebler is the reverse action, while\r\nfor feebler bases such as Al_{2}O_{3}, MgO, &c., this reverse reaction\r\nproceeds with ease. Metallic chlorides corresponding with the peroxides\r\neither do not exist, or are easily decomposed with the disengagement\r\nof chlorine. Thus there is no compound BaCl_{4} corresponding with\r\nthe peroxide BaO_{2}. Metallic chlorides having the general aspect of\r\nsalts, like their representative sodium chloride, are, as a rule, easily\r\nfusible, more so than the oxides (for instance, CaO is infusible at a\r\nfurnace heat, whilst CaCl_{2} is easily fused) and many other salts.\r\nUnder the action of heat many chlorides are more stable than the oxides,\r\nsome can even be converted into vapour; thus corrosive sublimate,\r\nHgCl_{2}, is particularly volatile, whilst the oxide HgO decomposes at\r\na red heat. Silver chloride, AgCl, is fusible and is decomposed with\r\ndifficulty, whilst Ag_{2}O is easily decomposed. The majority of the\r\nmetallic chlorides are soluble in water, but silver chloride, cuprous\r\nchloride, mercurous chloride, and lead chloride are sparingly soluble in\r\nwater, and are therefore easily obtained as precipitates when a solution\r\nof the salts of these metals is mixed with a solution of any chloride\r\nor even with hydrochloric acid. The metal contained in a haloid salt\r\nmay often be replaced by another metal, or even by hydrogen, just as is\r\nthe case with a metal in an oxide. Thus copper displaces mercury from\r\na solution of mercuric chloride, HgCl_{2} + Cu = CuCl_{2} + Hg, and\r\nhydrogen at a red heat displaces silver from silver chloride, 2AgCl +\r\nH_{2} = Ag_{2} + 2HCl. These, and a whole series of similar reactions,\r\nform the typical methods of double saline decompositions. The measure of\r\ndecomposition and the conditions under which reactions of double saline\r\ndecompositions proceed in one or in the other direction are determined\r\nby the properties of the compounds which take part in the reaction, and\r\nof those capable of formation at the temperature, &c., as was shown in\r\nthe preceding portions of this chapter, and as will be frequently found\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n  [42] Thus, for instance, with feeble bases they evolve in dilute\r\n       solutions (Chapter III., Note 53) almost equal amounts of heat;\r\n       their relation to sulphuric acid is quite identical. They both\r\n       form fuming solutions as well as hydrates; they both form\r\n       solutions of constant boiling point.\r\n\r\n  [42 bis] Pybalkin (1891) found that copper begins to disengage hydrogen\r\n       at 100°, and that chloride of copper begins to give up its\r\n       chlorine to hydrogen gas at 230°; for silver these temperatures\r\n       are 117° and 260°--that is, there is less difference between them.\r\n\r\nIf hydrochloric acid enters into double decomposition with basic oxides\r\nand their hydrates, this is only due to its acid properties; and for the\r\nsame reason it rarely enters into double decomposition with acids and\r\nacid anhydrides. Sometimes, however, it combines with the latter, as, for\r\ninstance, with the anhydride of sulphuric acid, forming the compound\r\nSO_{3}HCl; and in other cases it acts on acids, giving up its hydrogen to\r\ntheir oxygen and forming chlorine, as will be seen in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid, as may already be concluded from the composition of\r\nits molecule, belongs to the monobasic acids, and does not, therefore,\r\ngive true acid salts (like HNaSO_{4} or HNaCO_{3}); nevertheless\r\nmany metallic chlorides, formed from powerful bases, are capable of\r\n_combining with hydrochloric acid_, just as they combine with water,\r\nor with ammonia, or as they give double salts. Compounds have long\r\nbeen known of hydrochloric acid with auric, platinic, and antimonious\r\nchlorides, and other similar metallic chlorides corresponding with\r\nvery feeble bases. But Berthelot, Engel, and others have shown that\r\nthe capacity of HCl for combining with M_{_n_}Cl_{_m_} is much more\r\nfrequently encountered than was previously supposed. Thus, for\r\ninstance, dry hydrochloric acid when passed into a solution of zinc\r\nchloride (containing an excess of the salt) gives in the cold (0°)\r\na compound HCl,ZnCl_{2},2H_{2}O, and at the ordinary temperature\r\nHCl,2ZnCl_{2},2H_{2}O, just as it is able at low temperatures to\r\nform the crystallo-hydrate ZnCl_{2},3H_{2}O (Engel, 1886). Similar\r\ncompounds are obtained with CdCl_{2},CuCl_{2}, HgCl_{2},Fe_{2}Cl_{6},\r\n&c. (Berthelot, Ditte, Cheltzoff, Lachinoff, and others). These\r\ncompounds with hydrochloric acid are generally more soluble in water\r\nthan the metallic chlorides themselves, so that whilst hydrochloric\r\nacid decreases the solubility of M_{_n_}Cl_{_m_}, corresponding with\r\nenergetic bases (for instance, sodium or barium chlorides), it increases\r\nthe solubility of the metallic chlorides corresponding with feeble bases\r\n(cadmium chloride, ferric chloride, &c.) Silver chloride, which is\r\ninsoluble in water, is soluble in hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid\r\nalso combines with certain unsaturated hydrocarbons (for instance, with\r\nturpentine, C_{10}H_{16},2HCl) and their derivatives. _Sal-ammoniac_,\r\nor ammonia hydrochloride, NH_{4}Cl = NH_{3},HCl, also belongs to\r\nthis class of compounds.[43] If hydrogen chloride gas be mixed with\r\nammonia gas a solid compound consisting of equal volumes of each is\r\nimmediately formed. The same compound is obtained on mixing solutions of\r\nthe two gases. It is also produced by the action of hydrochloric acid\r\non ammonium carbonate. Sal-ammoniac is usually prepared, in practice,\r\nby the last method.[44] The specific gravity of sal-ammoniac is 1·55.\r\nWe have already seen (Chapter VI.) that sal-ammoniac, like all other\r\nammonium salts, easily decomposes; for instance, by volatilisation with\r\nalkalis, and even partially when its solution is boiled. The other\r\nproperties and reactions of sal-ammoniac, especially in solution, fully\r\nrecall those already mentioned in speaking of sodium chloride. Thus, for\r\ninstance, with silver nitrate it gives a precipitate of silver chloride;\r\nwith sulphuric acid it gives hydrochloric acid and ammonium sulphate,\r\nand it forms double salts with certain metallic chlorides and other\r\nsalts.[45]\r\n\r\n  [43] When an unsaturated hydrocarbon, or, in general, an unsaturated\r\n       compound, assimilates to itself the molecules Cl_{2}, HCl, SO_{3},\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4}, &c., the cause of the reaction is most simple. As\r\n       nitrogen, besides the type NX_{3} to which NH_{3}, belongs, gives\r\n       compounds of the type NX_{5}--for example, NO_{2}(OH)--the\r\n       formation of the salts of ammonium should be understood in this\r\n       way. NH_{3} gives NH_{4}Cl because NX_{3} is capable of giving\r\n       NX_{5}. But as saturated compounds--for instance, SO_{3},H_{2}O,\r\n       NaCl, &c.--are also capable of combination even between\r\n       themselves, it is impossible to deny the capacity of HCl also for\r\n       combination. SO_{3} combines with H_{2}O, and also with HCl and\r\n       the unsaturated hydrocarbons. It is impossible to recognise the\r\n       distinction formerly sought to be established between atomic and\r\n       molecular compounds, and regarding, for instance, PCl_{3} as an\r\n       atomic compound and PCl_{5} as a molecular one, only because it\r\n       easily splits up into molecules PCl_{3} and Cl_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [44] Sal-ammoniac is prepared from ammonium carbonate, obtained in the\r\n       dry distillation of nitrogenous substances (Chapter VI.), by\r\n       saturating the resultant solution with hydrochloric acid. A\r\n       solution of sal-ammoniac is thus produced, which is evaporated,\r\n       and in the residue a mass is obtained containing a mixture of\r\n       various other, especially tarry, products of dry distillation. The\r\n       sal-ammoniac is generally purified by sublimation. For this\r\n       purpose iron vessels covered with hemispherical metallic covers\r\n       are employed, or else simply clay crucibles covered by other\r\n       crucibles. The upper portion, or head, of the apparatus of this\r\n       kind will have a lower temperature than the lower portion, which\r\n       is under the direct action of the flame. The sal-ammoniac\r\n       volatilises when heated, and settles on the cooler portion of the\r\n       apparatus. It is thus freed from many impurities, and is obtained\r\n       as a crystalline crust, generally several centimetres thick, in\r\n       which form it is commonly sold. The solubility of sal-ammoniac\r\n       rises rapidly with the temperature: at 0°, 100 parts of water\r\n       dissolve about 28 parts of NH_{4}Cl, at 50° about 50 parts, and at\r\n       the ordinary temperature about 35 parts. This is sometimes taken\r\n       advantage of for separating NH_{4}Cl from solutions of other\r\n       salts.\r\n\r\n  [45] The solubility of sal-ammoniac in 100 parts of water (according to\r\n       Alluard) is--\r\n\r\n           0°    10°    20°    30°    40°  60°  80°  100°  110°\r\n          28·40  32·48  37·28  41·72  46   55   64    73    77\r\n\r\n       A saturated solution boils at 115°·8. The specific gravity at\r\n       15°/4° of solutions of sal-ammoniac (water 4° = 10,000) =\r\n       9,991·6-31·26_p_-0·085_p_^2, where _p_ is the amount by weight of\r\n       ammonium chloride in 100 parts of solution. With the majority of\r\n       salts the differential _ds_/_dp_ increases, but here it decreases\r\n       with the increase of _p_. For (unlike the sodium and potassium\r\n       salts) a solution of the alkali _plus_ a solution of acid occupy a\r\n       greater volume than that of the resultant ammonium salt. In the\r\n       solution of _solid_ ammonium chloride a contraction, and not\r\n       expansion, generally takes place. It may further be remarked that\r\n       solutions of sal-ammoniac have an acid reaction even when prepared\r\n       from the salt remaining after prolonged washing of the sublimed\r\n       salt with water (A. Stcherbakoff).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n          THE HALOGENS: CHLORINE, BROMINE, IODINE, AND FLUORINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough hydrochloric acid, like water, is one of the most stable\r\nsubstances, it is nevertheless decomposed not only by the action of\r\na galvanic current,[1] but also by a high temperature. Sainte-Claire\r\nDeville showed that decomposition already occurs at 1,300°, because a\r\ncold tube (as with CO, Chapter IX.) covered with an amalgam of silver\r\nabsorbs chlorine from hydrochloric acid in a red-hot tube, and the\r\nescaping gas contains hydrogen.

Meyer and Langer (1885) observed\r\nthe decomposition of hydrochloric acid at 1,690° in a platinum vessel;\r\nthe decomposition in this instance was proved not only from the fact\r\nthat hydrogen diffused through the platinum (p. 142), owing to which\r\nthe volume was diminished, but also from chlorine being obtained in the\r\nresidue (the hydrogen chloride was mixed with nitrogen), which liberated\r\niodine from potassium iodide.[2] The usual method for the preparation\r\nof chlorine consists in the abstraction of the hydrogen by oxidising\r\nagents.[2 bis]\r\n\r\n  [1] The decomposition of fused sodium chloride by an electric current\r\n      has been proposed in America and Russia (N. N. Beketoff) as a means\r\n      for the preparation of chlorine and sodium. A strong solution of\r\n      hydrochloric acid is decomposed into equal volumes of chlorine and\r\n      hydrogen by the action of an electric current. If sodium chloride\r\n      and lead be melted in a crucible, the former being connected with\r\n      the cathode and a carbon anode immersed in the lead, then the lead\r\n      dissolves sodium and chlorine is disengaged as gas. This\r\n      electrolytic method has not yet been practised on a large scale,\r\n      probably because gaseous chlorine has not many applications, and\r\n      because of the difficulty there is in dealing with it.\r\n\r\n  [2] To obtain so high a temperature (at which the best kinds of\r\n      porcelain soften) Langer and Meyer employed the dense graphitoidal\r\n      carbon from gas retorts, and a powerful blast. They determined the\r\n      temperature by the alteration of the volume of nitrogen in the\r\n      platinum vessel, for this gas does not permeate through platinum,\r\n      and is unaltered by heat.\r\n\r\n  [2 bis] The acid properties of hydrochloric acid were known when\r\n      Lavoisier pointed out the formation of acids by the combination of\r\n      water with the oxides of the non-metals, and therefore there was\r\n      reason for thinking that hydrochloric acid was formed by the\r\n      combination of water with the oxide of some element. Hence when\r\n      Scheele obtained chlorine by the action of hydrochloric acid on\r\n      manganese peroxide he considered it as the acid contained in common\r\n      salt. When it became known that chlorine gives hydrochloric acid\r\n      with hydrogen, Lavoisier and Berthollet supposed it to be a\r\n      compound with oxygen of an anhydride contained in hydrochloric\r\n      acid. They supposed that hydrochloric acid contained water and the\r\n      oxide of a particular radicle, and that chlorine was a higher\r\n      degree of oxidation of this radicle _muvias_ (from the Latin neme\r\n      of hydrochloric acid, _acidum muriaticum_). It was only in 1811\r\n      that Gay-Lussac and Thénard in France and Davy in England arrived\r\n      at the conclusion that the substance obtained by Scheele does not\r\n      contain oxygen, nor under any conditions give water with hydrogen,\r\n      and that there is no water in hydrochloric acid gas, and therefore\r\n      concluded that chlorine is an elementary substance. They named it\r\n      'chlorine' from the Greek word [Greek: chlôros], signifying a green\r\n      colour, because of the peculiar colour by which this gas is\r\n      characterised.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid is generally employed for t he\r\nevolution of chlorine. The hydrogen has to be abstracted from the\r\nhydrochloric acid. This is accomplished by nearly all oxidising\r\nsubstances, and especially by those which are able to evolve oxygen at a\r\nred heat (besides bases, such as mercury and silver oxides, which are\r\nable to give salts with hydrogen chloride); for example, manganese\r\nperoxide, potassium chlorate, chromic acid, &c. The decomposition\r\nessentially consists in the oxygen of the oxidising substance displacing\r\nthe chlorine from 2HCl, forming water, H_{2}O, and setting the chlorine\r\nfree, 2HCl + O (disengaged by the oxidising substances) = H_{2}O +\r\nCl_{2}. Even nitric acid partially produces a like reaction; but as we\r\nshall afterwards see its action is more complicated, and it is therefore\r\nnot suitable for the preparation of pure chlorine.[3] But other oxidising\r\nsubstances which do not give any other volatile products with\r\nhydrochloric acid may be employed for the preparation of chlorine. Among\r\nthese may be mentioned: potassium chlorate, acid potassium chromate,\r\nsodium manganate, manganese peroxide, &c. Manganese peroxide is commonly\r\nemployed in the laboratory, and on a large scale, for the preparation of\r\nchlorine. The chemical process in this case may be represented as\r\nfollows: an exchange takes place between 4HCl and MnO_{2}, in which the\r\nmanganese takes the place of the four atoms of hydrogen, or the chlorine\r\nand oxygen exchange places--that is, MnCl_{4} and 2H_{2}O are produced.\r\nThe chlorine compound, MnCl_{4}, obtained is very unstable; it splits up\r\ninto chlorine, which as a gas passes from the sphere of action, and a\r\nlower compound containing less chlorine than the substance first formed,\r\nwhich remains in the apparatus in which the mixture is heated, MnCl_{4} =\r\nMnCl_{2} + Cl_{2}.[3 bis] The action of hydrochloric acid requires a\r\ntemperature of about 100°. In the laboratory the _preparation of\r\nchlorine_ is carried on in flasks, heated over a water-bath, by acting on\r\nmanganese peroxide with hydrochloric acid or a mixture of common salt\r\nand sulphuric acid[4] and washing the gas with water to remove\r\nhydrochloric acid.[5] Chlorine cannot be collected over mercury, because\r\nit combines with it as with many other metals, and it is soluble in\r\nwater; however, it is but slightly soluble in hot water or brine. Owing\r\nto its great weight, chlorine may be directly collected in a dry vessel\r\nby carrying the gas-conducting tube down to the bottom of the vessel. The\r\nchlorine will lie in a heavy layer at the bottom of the vessel, displace\r\nthe air, and the extent to which it fills the vessel may be followed by\r\nits colour.[6]\r\n\r\n  [3] However, nitric acid has been proposed as a means for obtaining\r\n      chlorine, but by methods which have the drawback of being very\r\n      complicated\r\n\r\n  [3 bis] This representation of the process of the reaction is most\r\n      natural. However, this decomposition is generally represented as if\r\n      chlorine gave only one degree of combination with manganese,\r\n      MnCl_{2}, and therefore directly reacts in the following\r\n      manner--MnO_{2} + 4HCl = MnCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O + Cl_{2}, in which case\r\n      it is supposed that manganese peroxide, MnO_{2}, breaks up, as it\r\n      were, into manganous oxide, MnO and oxygen, both of which react\r\n      with hydrochloric acid, the manganous oxide acting upon HCl as a\r\n      base, giving MnCl_{2} and at the same time 2HCl + O = H_{2}O +\r\n      Cl_{2}. In reality, a mixture of oxygen and hydrochloric acid does\r\n      give chlorine at a red heat, and this reaction may also take place\r\n      at the moment of its evolution in this case.\r\n\r\n      All the oxides of manganese (Mn_{2}O_{3}, MnO_{2}, MnO_{3},\r\n      Mn_{2}O_{7}), with the exception of manganous oxide, MnO, disengage\r\n      chlorine from hydrochloric acid, because manganous chloride,\r\n      MnCl_{2}, is the only compound of chlorine and manganese which\r\n      exists as a stable compound, all the higher chlorides of manganese\r\n      being unstable and evolving chlorine. Hence we here take note of\r\n      two separate changes: (1) an exchange between oxygen and chlorine,\r\n      and (2) the instability of the higher chlorine compounds. As\r\n      (according to the law of substitution) in the substitution of\r\n      oxygen by chlorine, Cl_{2} takes the place of O, the chlorine\r\n      compounds will contain more atoms than the corresponding oxygen\r\n      compounds. It is not surprising, therefore, that certain of the\r\n      chlorine compounds corresponding with oxygen compounds do not\r\n      exist, or if they are formed are very unstable. And furthermore, an\r\n      atom of chlorine is heavier than an atom of oxygen, and therefore a\r\n      given element would have to retain a large mass of chlorine if in\r\n      the higher oxides the oxygen were replaced by chlorine. For this\r\n      reason equivalent compounds of chlorine do not exist for all oxygen\r\n      compounds. Many of the former are immediately decomposed, when\r\n      formed, with the evolution of chlorine. From this it is evident\r\n      that there should exist such chlorine compounds as would evolve\r\n      chlorine as peroxides evolve oxygen, and indeed a large number of\r\n      such compounds are known. Amongst them may be mentioned antimony\r\n      pentachloride, SbCl_{5}, which splits up into chlorine and antimony\r\n      trichloride when heated. Cupric chloride, corresponding with copper\r\n      oxide, and having a composition CuCl_{2}, similar to CuO, when\r\n      heated parts with half its chlorine, just as barium peroxide\r\n      evolves half its oxygen. This method may even be taken advantage of\r\n      for the preparation of chlorine and cuprous chloride, CuCl. The\r\n      latter attracts oxygen from the atmosphere, and in so doing is\r\n      converted from a colourless substance into a green compound whose\r\n      composition is Cu_{2}Cl_{2}O. With hydrochloric acid this substance\r\n      gives cupric chloride (Cu_{2}Cl_{2}O + 2HCl = H_{2}O + 2CuCl_{2}),\r\n      which has only to be dried and heated in order again to obtain\r\n      chlorine. Thus, in solution, and at the ordinary temperature, the\r\n      compound CuCl_{2} is stable, but when heated it splits up. On this\r\n      property is founded Deacon's process for the preparation of\r\n      chlorine from hydrochloric acid with the aid of air and copper\r\n      salts, by passing a mixture of air and hydrochloric acid at about\r\n      440° over bricks saturated with a solution of a copper salt (a\r\n      mixture of solutions of CuSO_{4} and Na_{2}SO_{4}). CuCl_{2} is\r\n      then formed by the double decomposition of the salt of copper and\r\n      the hydrochloric acid; the CuCl_{2} liberates chlorine, and the\r\n      CuCl forms Cu_{2}Cl_{2}O with the oxygen of the air, which again\r\n      gives CuCl_{2} with 2HCl, and so on.\r\n\r\n      Magnesium chloride, which is obtained from sea-water, carnallite,\r\n      &c., may serve not only as a means for the preparation of\r\n      hydrochloric acid, but also of chlorine, because its basic salt\r\n      (magnesium oxychloride) when heated in the air gives magnesium\r\n      oxide and chlorine (Weldon-Pechiney's process, 1888). Chlorine is\r\n      now prepared on a large scale by this method. Several new methods\r\n      based upon this reaction have been proposed for procuring chlorine\r\n      from the bye-products of other chemical processes. Thus, Lyte and\r\n      Tattars (1891) obtained up to 67 p.c. of chlorine from CaCl_{2} in\r\n      this manner. A solution of CaCl_{2}, containing a certain amount of\r\n      common salt, is evaporated and oxide of magnesium added to it. When\r\n      the solution attains a density of 1·2445 (at 15°), it is treated\r\n      with carbonic acid, which precipitates carbonate of calcium, while\r\n      chloride of magnesium remains in solution. After adding ammonium\r\n      chloride, the solution is evaporated to dryness and the double\r\n      chloride of magnesium and ammonium formed is ignited, which drives\r\n      off the chloride of ammonium. The chloride of magnesium which\r\n      remains behind is used in the Weldon-Pechiney process. The De\r\n      Wilde-Reychler (1892) process for the manufacture of chlorine\r\n      consists in passing alternate currents of hot air and hydrochloric\r\n      acid gas through a cylinder containing a mixture of the chlorides\r\n      of magnesium and manganese. A certain amount of sulphate of\r\n      magnesium which does not participate in any way in the reaction, is\r\n      added to the mixture to prevent its fusing. The reactions may be\r\n      expressed by the following equations: (1) 3MgCl_{2} + 3MnCl_{2} +\r\n      8O = Mg_{3}Mn_{3}O_{8} + 12Cl; (2) Mg_{3}Mn_{3}O_{8} + 16HCl =\r\n      3MgCl_{2} + 3MnCl_{2} + 8H_{2}O + 4Cl. As nitric acid is able to\r\n      take up the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid, a heated mixture of\r\n      these acids is also employed for the preparation of chlorine. The\r\n      resultant mixture of chlorine and lower oxides of nitrogen is mixed\r\n      with air and steam which regenerates the HNO_{3}, while the\r\n      chlorine remains as a gas together with nitrogen, in which form it\r\n      is quite capable of bleaching, forming chloride of lime, &c.\r\n      Besides these, Solvay and Mond's methods of preparing chlorine must\r\n      be mentioned. The first is based upon the reaction CaCl_{2} +\r\n      SiO_{2} + O(air) = CaOSiO_{2} + Cl_{2}, the second on the action of\r\n      the oxygen of the air (heated) upon MgCl_{2} (and certain similar\r\n      chlorides) MgCl_{2} + O = MgO + Cl_{2} The remaining MgO is treated\r\n      with sal-ammoniac to re-form MgCl_{2} (MgO + 2NH_{4}Cl = MgCl_{2} +\r\n      H_{2}O + 2NH_{3}) and the resultant NH_{3} again converted into\r\n      sal-ammoniac, so that hydrochloric acid is the only substance\r\n      consumed. The latter processes have not yet found much application.\r\n\r\n  [4] The following proportions are accordingly taken by weight: 5 parts\r\n      of powdered manganese peroxide, 11 parts of salt (best fused, to\r\n      prevent its frothing), and 14 parts of sulphuric acid previously\r\n      mixed with an equal volume of water. The mixture is heated in a\r\n      salt bath, so as to obtain a temperature above 100°. The corks in\r\n      the apparatus must be soaked in paraffin (otherwise they are\r\n      corroded by the chlorine), and black india-rubber tubing smeared\r\n      with vaseline must be used, and not vulcanised rubber (which\r\n      contains sulphur, and becomes brittle under the action of the\r\n      chlorine).\r\n\r\n      The reaction which proceeds may be expressed thus: MnO_{2} + 2NaCl\r\n      + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = MnSO_{4} + Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2H_{2}O + Cl_{2}. The\r\n      method of preparation of Cl_{2} from manganese peroxide and\r\n      hydrochloric acid was discovered by Scheele, and from sodium\r\n      chloride by Berthollet.\r\n\r\n  [5] The reaction of hydrochloric acid upon bleaching powder gives\r\n      chlorine without the aid of heat, CaCl_{2}O_{2} + 4HCl = CaCl_{2} +\r\n      2H_{2}O + 2Cl_{2} and is therefore also used for the preparation of\r\n      chlorine. This reaction is very violent if all the acid be added at\r\n      once; it should be poured in drop by drop (Mermé, Kämmerer). C.\r\n      Winkler proposed to mix bleaching powder with one quarter of burnt\r\n      and powdered gypsum, and having damped the mixture with water, to\r\n      press and cut it up into cubes and dry at the ordinary temperature.\r\n      These cubes can be used for the preparation of chlorine in the same\r\n      apparatus as that used for the evolution of hydrogen and carbonic\r\n      anhydride--the disengagement of the chlorine proceeds uniformly.\r\n\r\n      A mixture of potassium dichromate and hydrochloric acid evolves\r\n      chlorine perfectly free from oxygen (V. Meyer and Langer).\r\n\r\n  [6] [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Clay retort for the preparation of chlorine\r\n      on a large scale.]\r\n\r\n      Chlorine is manufactured on a _large scale_ from manganese peroxide\r\n      and hydrochloric acid. It is most conveniently prepared in the\r\n      apparatus shown in fig. 66, which consists of a three-necked\r\n      earthenware vessel whose central orifice is the largest. A clay or\r\n      lead funnel, furnished with a number of orifices, is placed in the\r\n      central wide neck of the vessel. Roughly-ground lumps of natural\r\n      manganese peroxide are placed in the funnel, which is then closed\r\n      by the cover N, and luted with clay. One orifice is closed by a\r\n      clay stopper, and is used for the introduction of the hydrochloric\r\n      acid and withdrawal of the residues. The chlorine disengaged passes\r\n      along a leaden gas-conducting tube placed in the other orifice. A\r\n      row of these vessels is surrounded by a water-bath to ensure their\r\n      being uniformly heated. Manganese chloride is found in the residue.\r\n      In Weldon's process lime is added to the acid solution of manganese\r\n      chloride. A double decomposition takes place, resulting in the\r\n      formation of manganous hydroxide and calcium chloride. When the\r\n      insoluble manganous hydroxide has settled, a further excess of milk\r\n      of lime is added (to make a mixture 2Mn(OH)_{2} + CaO +\r\n      _x_CaCl_{2}, which is found to be the best proportion, judging from\r\n      experiment), and then air is forced through the mixture. The\r\n      hydroxide is thus converted from a colourless to a brown substance,\r\n      containing peroxide, MnO_{2}, and oxide of manganese, Mn_{2}O_{3}.\r\n      This is due to the manganous oxide absorbing oxygen from the air.\r\n      Under the action of hydrochloric acid this mixture evolves\r\n      chlorine, because of all the compounds of chlorine and manganese\r\n      the chloride MnCl_{2} is the only one which is stable (_see_ Note\r\n      3). Thus one and the same mass of manganese may be repeatedly used\r\n      for the preparation of chlorine. The same result is attained in\r\n      other ways. If manganous oxide be subjected to the action of oxides\r\n      of nitrogen and air (Coleman's process), then manganese nitrate is\r\n      formed, which at a red heat gives oxides of nitrogen (which are\r\n      again used in the process) and manganese peroxide, which is thus\r\n      renewed for the fresh evolution of chlorine.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a _gas_ of a yellowish green colour, and has a very\r\nsuffocating and characteristic odour. On lowering the temperature to\r\n-50° or increasing the pressure to six atmospheres (at 0°) chlorine\r\ncondenses[7] into a liquid which has a yellowish-green colour, a density\r\nof 1·3, and boils at -34°. The density and atomic weight of chlorine is\r\n35·5 times greater than that of hydrogen, hence the molecule contains\r\nCl_{2}[8]. At 0° one volume of water dissolves about 1-1/2 volume of\r\nchlorine, at 10° about 3 volumes, at 50° again 1-1/2 volume.[9] Such\r\na solution of chlorine is termed 'chlorine water;' and is employed in\r\na diluted form in medicine and as a laboratory reagent. It is prepared\r\nby passing chlorine through a series of Woulfe's bottles or into an\r\ninverted retort filled with water. Under the action of light, chlorine\r\nwater gives oxygen and hydrochloric acid. At 0° a saturated solution of\r\nchlorine yields a crystallo-hydrate, Cl_{2},8H_{2}O, which easily splits\r\nup into chlorine and water when heated, so that if it be sealed up in a\r\ntube and heated to 35°, two layers of liquid are formed--a lower stratum\r\nof chlorine containing a small quantity of water, and an upper stratum\r\nof water containing a small quantity of chlorine.[10]\r\n\r\n  [7] Davy and Faraday liquefied chlorine in 1823 by heating the\r\n      crystallo-hydrate Cl_{2}8H_{2}O in a bent tube (as with NH_{3}),\r\n      surrounded by warm water, while the other end of the tube was\r\n      immersed in a freezing mixture. Meselan condensed chlorine in\r\n      freshly-burnt charcoal (placed in a glass tube), which when cold\r\n      absorbs an equal weight of chlorine. The tube was then fused up,\r\n      the bent end cooled, and the charcoal heated, by which means the\r\n      chlorine was expelled from the charcoal, and the pressure\r\n      increased.\r\n\r\n  [8] Judging from Ludwig's observations (1868), and from the fact that\r\n      the coefficient of expansion of gases increases with their\r\n      molecular weight (Chapter II., Note 26, for hydrogen = 0·367,\r\n      carbonic anhydride = 0·373, hydrogen bromide = 0·386), it might be\r\n      expected that the expansion of chlorine would be greater than that\r\n      of air or of the gases composing it. V. Meyer and Langer (1885)\r\n      having remarked that at 1,400° the density of chlorine (taking its\r\n      expansion as equal to that of nitrogen) = 29, consider that the\r\n      molecules of chlorine split up and partially give molecules Cl, but\r\n      it might be maintained that the decrease in density observed only\r\n      depends on the increase of the coefficient of expansion.\r\n\r\n  [9] Investigations on the solubility of chlorine in water (the\r\n      solutions evolve all their chlorine on boiling and passing air\r\n      through them) show many different peculiarities. First Gay-Lussac,\r\n      and subsequently Pelouze, determined that the solubility increases\r\n      between 0° and 8°-10° (from 1-1/2 to 2 vols. of chlorine per 100\r\n      vols. of water at 0° up to 3 to 2-3/4 at 10°). In the following\r\n      note we shall see that this is not due to the breaking-up of the\r\n      hydrate at about 8° to 10°, but to its formation below 9°. Roscoe\r\n      observed an increase in the solubility of chlorine in the presence\r\n      of hydrogen--even in the dark. Berthelot determined an increase of\r\n      solubility with the progress of time. Schönbein and others suppose\r\n      that chlorine acts on water, forming hypochlorous and hypochloric\r\n      acids, (HClO + HCl).\r\n\r\n      The equilibrium between chlorine and steam as gases and between\r\n      water, liquid chlorine, ice, and the solid crystallo-hydrate of\r\n      chlorine is evidently very complex. Gibbs, Guldberg (1870) and\r\n      others gave a theory for similar states of equilibrium, which was\r\n      afterwards developed by Roozeboom (1887), but it would be\r\n      inopportune here to enter into its details. It will be sufficient\r\n      in the first place to mention that there is now no doubt (according\r\n      to the theory of heat, and the direct observations of Ramsay and\r\n      Young) that the vapour tensions at one and the same temperature are\r\n      different for the liquid and solid states of substances; secondly,\r\n      to call attention to the following note; and, thirdly, to state\r\n      that, in the presence of the crystallo-hydrate, water between O°·24\r\n      and +28°·7 (when the hydrate and a solution may occur\r\n      simultaneously) dissolves a different amount of chlorine than it\r\n      does in the absence of the crystallo-hydrate.\r\n\r\n  [10] According to Faraday's data the hydrate of chlorine contains\r\n       Cl_{2},10H_{2}O, but Roozeboom (1885) showed that it is poorer in\r\n       water and = Cl_{2},8H_{2}O. At first small, almost colourless,\r\n       crystals are obtained, but they gradually form (if the temperature\r\n       be below their critical point 28°·7, above which they do not\r\n       exist) large yellow crystals, like those of potassium chromate.\r\n       The specific gravity is 1·23. The hydrate is formed if there be\r\n       more chlorine in a solution than it is able to dissolve under the\r\n       dissociation pressure corresponding with a given temperature. _In\r\n       the presence of the hydrate_ the percentage amount of chlorine at\r\n       0° = 0·5, at 9° = 0·9, and at 20° = 1·82. At temperatures below 9°\r\n       the solubility (determined by Gay-Lussac and Pelouze, _see_ Note\r\n       9) is dependent on the formation of the hydrate; whilst at higher\r\n       temperatures under the ordinary pressure the hydrate cannot be\r\n       formed, and the solubility of chlorine falls, as it does for all\r\n       gases (Chapter I.). If the crystallo-hydrate is not formed, then\r\n       below 9° the solubility follows the same rule (6° 1·07 p.c. Cl, 9°\r\n       0·95 p.c.). According to Roozeboom, the chlorine evolved by the\r\n       hydrate presents the following tensions of dissociation: at 0° =\r\n       249 mm., at 4° = 398, at 8° = 620, at 10° = 797, at 14° = 1,400\r\n       mm. In this case a portion of the crystallo-hydrate remains solid.\r\n       At 9°·6 the tension of dissociation is equal to the atmospheric\r\n       pressure. At a higher pressure the crystallo-hydrate may form at\r\n       temperatures above 9° up to 28°·7, when the vapour tension of the\r\n       hydrate equals the tension of the chlorine. It is evident that the\r\n       equilibrium which is established is on the one hand a case of a\r\n       complex heterogeneous system, and on the other hand a case of the\r\n       solution of solid and gaseous substances in water.\r\n\r\n       The crystallo-hydrate or chlorine water must be kept in the dark,\r\n       or the access of light be prevented by coloured glass, otherwise\r\n       oxygen is evolved and hydrochloric acid formed.\r\n\r\nChlorine explodes _with hydrogen_, if a mixture of equal volumes be\r\nexposed to the direct action of the sun's rays[11] or brought into\r\ncontact with spongy platinum, or a strongly heated substance, or when\r\nsubjected to the action of an electric spark. The explosion in this case\r\ntakes place for exactly the same reasons--_i.e._ the evolution of heat\r\nand expansion of the resultant product--as in the case of detonating\r\ngas (Chapter III.) Diffused light acts in the same way, but slowly,\r\nwhilst direct sunlight causes an explosion.[12] The hydrochloric acid\r\ngas produced by the reaction of chlorine on hydrogen occupies (at the\r\noriginal temperature and pressure) a volume equal to the sum of the\r\noriginal volumes; that is, a reaction of substitution here takes place:\r\nH_{2} + Cl_{2} = HCl + HCl. In this reaction twenty-two thousand heat\r\nunits are evolved for one part by weight [1 gram] of hydrogen.[13]\r\n\r\n  [11] The chemical action of light on a mixture of chlorine and\r\n       hydrogen was discovered by Gay-Lussac and Thénard (1809). It has\r\n       been investigated by many savants, and especially by Draper,\r\n       Bunsen, and Roscoe. Electric or magnesium light, or the light\r\n       emitted by the combustion of carbon bisulphide in nitric oxide,\r\n       and actinic light in general, acts in the same manner as sunlight,\r\n       in proportion to its intensity. At temperatures below -12° light\r\n       no longer brings about reaction, or at all events does not give an\r\n       explosion. It was long supposed that chlorine that had been\r\n       subjected to the action of light was afterwards able to act on\r\n       hydrogen in the dark, but it was shown that this only takes place\r\n       with moist chlorine, and depends on the formation of oxides of\r\n       chlorine. The presence of foreign gases, and even of excess of\r\n       chlorine or of hydrogen, very much enfeebles the explosion, and\r\n       therefore the experiment is conducted with a detonating mixture\r\n       prepared by the action of an electric current on a strong solution\r\n       (sp. gr. 1·15) of hydrochloric acid, in which case the water is\r\n       not decomposed--that is, no oxygen becomes mixed with the\r\n       chlorine.\r\n\r\n  [12] The quantity of chlorine and hydrogen which combine is\r\n       proportional to the intensity of the light--not of all the rays,\r\n       but only those so-termed chemical (actinic) rays which produce\r\n       chemical action. Hence a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen, when\r\n       exposed to the action of light in vessels of known capacity and\r\n       surface, may be employed as an actinometer--that is, as a means\r\n       for estimating the intensity of the chemical rays, the influence\r\n       of the heat rays being previously destroyed, which may be done by\r\n       passing the rays through water. Investigations of this kind\r\n       (photo-chemical) showed that chemical action is chiefly limited to\r\n       the violet end of the spectrum, and that even the invisible\r\n       ultra-violet rays produce this action. A colourless gas flame\r\n       contains no chemically active rays; the flame coloured green by a\r\n       salt of copper evinces more chemical action than the colourless\r\n       flame, but the flame brightly coloured yellow by salts of sodium\r\n       has no more chemical action than that of the colourless flame.\r\n\r\n       As the chemical action of light becomes evident in plants,\r\n       photography, the bleaching of tissues, and the fading of colours\r\n       in the sunlight, and as a means for studying the phenomenon is\r\n       given in the reaction of chlorine on hydrogen, this subject has\r\n       been the most fully investigated in _photo-chemistry_. The\r\n       researches of Bunsen and Roscoe in the fifties and sixties are the\r\n       most complete in this respect. Their actinometer contains hydrogen\r\n       and chlorine, and is surrounded by a solution of chlorine in\r\n       water. The hydrochloric acid is absorbed as it forms, and\r\n       therefore the variation in volume indicates the progress of the\r\n       combination. As was to be expected, the action of light proved to\r\n       be proportional to the time of exposure and intensity of the\r\n       light, so that it was possible to conduct detailed photometrical\r\n       investigations respecting the time of day and season of the year,\r\n       various sources of light, its absorption, &c. This subject is\r\n       considered in detail in special works, and we only stop to mention\r\n       one circumstance, that a small quantity of a foreign gas decreases\r\n       the action of light; for example, 1/330 of hydrogen by 38 p.c.,\r\n       1/200 of oxygen by 10 p.c., 1/100 of chlorine by 60 p.c., &c.\r\n       According to the researches of Klimenko and Pekatoros (1889), the\r\n       photo-chemical alteration of chlorine water is retarded by the\r\n       presence of traces of metallic chlorides, and this influence\r\n       varies with different metals.\r\n\r\n       As much heat is evolved in the reaction of chlorine on hydrogen,\r\n       and as this reaction, being exothermal, may proceed by itself, the\r\n       action of light is essentially the same as that of heat--that is,\r\n       it brings the chlorine and hydrogen into the condition necessary\r\n       for the reaction--it, as we may say, disturbs the original\r\n       equilibrium; this is the work done by the luminous energy. It\r\n       seems to me that the action of light on the mixed gases should be\r\n       understood in this sense, as Pringsheim (1877) pointed out.\r\n\r\n  [13] In the formation of steam (from one part by weight [1 gram]\r\n       of hydrogen) 29,000 heat units are evolved. The following are the\r\n       quantities of heat (thousands of units) evolved in the formation\r\n       of various other _corresponding_ compounds of oxygen and of\r\n       chlorine (from Thomsen's, and, for Na_{2}O, Beketoff's results):\r\n\r\n       {2NaCl,        195; CaCl_{2},    170; HgCl_{2}, 63; 2AgCl,    59.\r\n       { Na_{2}O,     100;  CaO,        131;  HgO,     42;  Ag_{2}O,  6.\r\n       {2AsCl_{3},    143; 2PCl_{5},    210;  CCl_{4}, 21; 2HCl,     44\r\n                                                                   (gas).\r\n       { As_{2}O_{3}, 155;  P_{2}O_{5}, 370;  CO_{2},  97;  H_{2}O,  58\r\n                                                                   (gas).\r\n\r\n       With the first four elements the formation of the chlorine\r\n       compound gives the most heat, and with the four following the\r\n       formation of the oxygen compound evolves the greater amount of\r\n       heat. The first four chlorides are true salts formed from HCl and\r\n       the oxide, whilst the remainder have other properties, as is seen\r\n       from the fact that they are not formed from hydrochloric acid and\r\n       the oxide, but give hydrochloric acid with water.\r\n\r\nThese relations show that the affinity of chlorine for hydrogen is\r\nvery great and analogous to the affinity between hydrogen and oxygen.\r\nThus[14] on the one hand by passing a mixture of steam and chlorine\r\nthrough a red-hot tube, or by exposing water and chlorine to the\r\nsunlight, oxygen is disengaged, whilst on the other hand, as we saw\r\nabove, oxygen in many cases displaces chlorine from its compound with\r\nhydrogen, and therefore the reaction H_{2}O + Cl_{2} = 2HCl + O belongs\r\nto the number of reversible reactions, and hydrogen will distribute\r\nitself between oxygen and chlorine. This determines the relation of Cl\r\nto substances containing hydrogen and its reactions in the presence of\r\nwater, to which we shall turn our attention after having pointed out the\r\nrelation of chlorine to other elements.\r\n\r\n  [14] This has been already pointed out in Chapter III., Note 5.\r\n\r\nMany _metals_ when brought into contact with chlorine immediately\r\ncombine with it, and form those metallic chlorides which correspond\r\nwith hydrogen chloride and with the oxide of the metal taken. This\r\ncombination may proceed rapidly with the evolution of heat and light;\r\nthat is, metals are able to burn in chlorine. Thus, for example,\r\nsodium[15] burns in chlorine, synthesising common salt. Metals in\r\nthe form of powders burn without the aid of heat, and become highly\r\nincandescent in the process; for instance, antimony, which is a metal\r\neasily converted into a powder.[16] Even such metals as gold and\r\nplatinum,[17] which do not combine directly with oxygen and give very\r\nunstable compounds with it, unite directly with chlorine to form\r\nmetallic chlorides. Either chlorine water or aqua regia may be employed\r\nfor this purpose instead of gaseous chlorine. These dissolve gold and\r\nplatinum, converting them into metallic chlorides. _Aqua regia_ is a\r\nmixture of 1 part of nitric acid with 2 to 3 parts of hydrochloric\r\nacid. This mixture converts into soluble chlorides not only those\r\nmetals which are acted on by hydrochloric and nitric acids, but also\r\ngold and platinum, which are insoluble in either acid separately.\r\nThis action of aqua regia depends on the fact that nitric acid in\r\nacting on hydrochloric acid evolves chlorine. If the chlorine evolved\r\nbe transferred to a metal, then a fresh quantity is formed from the\r\nremaining acids and also combines with the metal.[18] Thus the aqua\r\nregia acts by virtue of the chlorine which it contains and disengages.\r\n\r\n  [15] Sodium remains unaltered in perfectly dry chlorine at the ordinary\r\n       temperature, and even when slightly warmed; but the combination is\r\n       exceedingly violent at a red heat.\r\n\r\n  [16] An instructive experiment on combustion in chlorine may be\r\n       conducted as follows: leaves of Dutch metal (used instead of gold\r\n       for gilding) are placed in a glass globe, and a gas-conducting\r\n       tube furnished with a glass cock is placed in the cork closing it,\r\n       and the air is pumped out of the globe. The gas-conducting tube is\r\n       then connected with a vessel containing chlorine, and the cock\r\n       opened; the chlorine rushes in, and the metallic leaves are\r\n       consumed.\r\n\r\n  [17] The behaviour of platinum to chlorine at a high temperature\r\n       (1,400°) is very remarkable, because platinous chloride, PtCl_{2},\r\n       is then formed, whilst this substance decomposes at a much lower\r\n       temperature into chlorine and platinum. Hence, when chlorine comes\r\n       into contact with platinum at such high temperatures, it forms\r\n       fumes of platinous chloride, and they on cooling decompose, with\r\n       the liberation of platinum, so that the phenomenon appears to be\r\n       dependent on the volatility of platinum. Deville proved the\r\n       formation of platinous chloride by inserting a cold tube inside a\r\n       red-hot one (as in the experiment on carbonic oxide). However, V.\r\n       Meyer was able to observe the density of chlorine in a platinum\r\n       vessel at 1,690°, at which temperature chlorine does not exert\r\n       this action on platinum, or at least only to an insignificant\r\n       degree.\r\n\r\n  [18] When left exposed to the air aqua regia disengages chlorine, and\r\n       afterwards it no longer acts on gold. Gay-Lussac, in explaining\r\n       the action of aqua regia, showed that when heated it evolves,\r\n       besides chlorine, the vapours of two chloranhydrides--that of\r\n       nitric acid, NO_{2}Cl (nitric acid, NO_{2}OH, in which HO is\r\n       replaced by chlorine; _see_ Chapter on Phosphorus), and that of\r\n       nitrous acid, NOCl--but these do not act on gold. The formation of\r\n       aqua regia may therefore be expressed by 4NHO_{3} + 8HCl =\r\n       2NO_{2}Cl + 2NOCl + 6H_{2}O + 2Cl_{2}. The formation of the\r\n       chlorides NO_{2}Cl and NOCl is explained by the fact that the\r\n       nitric acid is deoxidised, gives the oxides NO and NO_{2}, and\r\n       they directly combine with chlorine to form the above anhydrides.\r\n\r\nThe majority of _non-metals_ also react directly on chlorine; hot\r\nsulphur and phosphorus burn in it and combine with it at the ordinary\r\ntemperature. Only nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen do not combine directly\r\nwith it. The chlorine compounds formed by the non-metals--for instance,\r\nphosphorus trichloride, PCl_{3}, and sulphurous chloride, &c., do not\r\nhave the properties of salts, and, as we shall afterwards see more\r\nfully, correspond to acid anhydrides and acids; for example, PCl_{3}--to\r\nphosphorous acid, P(OH)_{3}:\r\n\r\n               NaCl    FeCl_{2}    SnCl_{4}    PCl_{3}      HCl\r\n               Na(HO)  Fe(HO)_{2}  Sn(HO)_{4}  P(HO)_{3}    H(HO)\r\n\r\nAs the above-mentioned relation in composition--_i.e._ substitution of\r\nCl by the aqueous residue--exists between many chlorine compounds and\r\ntheir corresponding hydrates, and as furthermore some (acid) hydrates\r\nare obtained from chlorine compounds by the action of water, for\r\ninstance,\r\n\r\n          PCl_{3}    +  3H_{2}0   =   P(HO)_{3}   +    3HCl\r\n         Phosphorus      Water       Phosphorous    Hydrochloric\r\n         trichloride                    acid           acid\r\n\r\nwhilst other chlorine compounds are formed from hydroxides and\r\nhydrochloric acid, with the liberation of water, for example,\r\n\r\n                       NaHO + HCl = NaCl + H_{2}O\r\n\r\nwe endeavour to express this intimate connection between the hydrates\r\nand chlorine compounds by calling the latter _chloranhydrides_. In\r\ngeneral terms, if the hydrate be basic, then,\r\n\r\n        M(HO)   +      HCl           =      MCl       + H_{2}O\r\n       hydrate  + hydrochloric acid  = chloranhydride + water\r\n\r\nand if the hydrate ROH be acid, then,\r\n\r\n             RCl       + H_{2}O  =  R(HO)   +      HCl\r\n        Chloranhydride + water   =  hydrate + hydrochloric acid\r\n\r\nThe chloranhydrides MCl corresponding to the bases are evidently\r\nmetallic chlorides or salts corresponding to HCl. In this manner a\r\ndistinct equivalency is marked between the compounds of chlorine and the\r\nso-called hydroxyl radicle (HO), which is also expressed in the analogy\r\nexisting between chlorine, Cl_{2}, and hydrogen peroxide, (HO)_{2}.\r\n\r\nAs regards the chloranhydrides corresponding to acids and non-metals,\r\nthey bear but little resemblance to metallic salts. They are nearly all\r\nvolatile, and have a powerful suffocating smell which irritates the eyes\r\nand respiratory organs. They react on water like many anhydrides of the\r\nacids, with the evolution of heat and liberation of hydrochloric acid,\r\nforming acid hydrates. For this reason they cannot usually be obtained\r\nfrom hydrates--that is, acids--by the action of hydrochloric acid, as in\r\nthat case water would be formed together with them, and water decomposes\r\nthem, converting them into hydrates. There are many intermediate\r\nchlorine compounds between true saline metallic chlorides like sodium\r\nchloride and true acid chloranhydrides, just as there are all kinds of\r\ntransitions between bases and acids. Acid chloranhydrides are not only\r\nobtained from chlorine and non-metals, but also from many lower oxides,\r\nby the aid of chlorine. Thus, for example, CO, NO, NO_{2}, SO_{2}, and\r\nother lower oxides which are capable of combining with oxygen may also\r\ncombine with a corresponding quantity of chlorine. Thus COCl_{2},\r\nNOCl, NO_{2}Cl, SO_{2}Cl_{2}, &c., are obtained. They correspond with\r\nthe hydrates CO(OH)_{2}, NO(OH), NO_{2}(OH), SO_{2}(OH)_{2}, &c., and\r\nto the anhydrides CO_{2}, N_{2}O_{3}, N_{2}O_{5}, SO_{3}, &c. Here\r\nwe should notice two aspects of the matter: (1) chlorine combines\r\nwith that with which oxygen is able to combine, because it is in many\r\nrespects equally if not more energetic than oxygen and replaces it in\r\nthe proportion Cl_{2} : O; (2) that highest limit of possible combination\r\nwhich is proper to a given element or grouping of elements is very\r\neasily and often attained by combination with chlorine. If phosphorus\r\ngives PCl_{3} and PCl_{5}, it is evident that PCl_{5} is the higher\r\nform of combination compared with PCl_{3}. To the form PCl_{5}, or\r\nin general PX_{5}, correspond PH_{4}I, PO(OH)_{3}, POCl_{3}, &c. If\r\nchlorine does not always directly give compounds of the highest possible\r\nforms for a given element, then generally the lower forms combine\r\nwith it in order to reach or approach the limit. This is particularly\r\nclear in hydrocarbons, where we see the limit C_{_n_}H_{2_n_+2} very\r\ndistinctly. The unsaturated hydrocarbons are sometimes able to combine\r\nwith chlorine with the greatest ease and thus reach the limit. Thus\r\nethylene, C_{2}H_{4}, combines with Cl_{2}, forming the so-called Dutch\r\nliquid or ethylene chloride, C_{2}H_{4}Cl_{2}, because it then reaches\r\nthe limit C_{_n_}X_{2_n_+2}. In this and all similar cases the combined\r\nchlorine is able by reactions of substitution to give a hydroxide and\r\na whole series of other derivatives. Thus a hydroxide called glycol,\r\nC_{2}H_{4}(OH)_{2}, is obtained from C_{2}H_{4}Cl_{2}.\r\n\r\nChlorine _in the presence of water_ very often acts directly _as an\r\noxidising agent_. A substance A combines with chlorine and gives, for\r\nexample, ACl_{2}, and this in turn a hydroxide, A(OH)_{2}, which on\r\nlosing water forms AO. Here the chlorine has oxidised the substance\r\nA. This frequently happens in the simultaneous action of water and\r\nchlorine: A + H_{2}O + Cl_{2} = 2HCl + AO. Examples of this oxidising\r\naction of chlorine may frequently be observed both in practical\r\nchemistry and technical processes. Thus, for instance, chlorine in the\r\npresence of water oxidises sulphur and metallic sulphides. In this\r\ncase the sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid, and the chlorine\r\ninto hydrochloric acid, or a metallic chloride if a metallic sulphide\r\nbe taken. A mixture of carbonic oxide and chlorine passed into water\r\ngives carbonic anhydride and hydrochloric acid. Sulphurous anhydride\r\nis oxidised by chlorine in the presence of water into sulphuric acid,\r\njust as it is by the action of nitric acid: SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O + Cl_{2} =\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} + 2HCl.\r\n\r\nThe oxidising action of chlorine in the presence of water is taken\r\nadvantage of in practice for the rapid bleaching of tissues and\r\nfibres. The colouring matter of the fibres is altered by oxidation and\r\nconverted into a colourless substance, but the chlorine afterwards acts\r\non the tissue itself. Bleaching by means of chlorine therefore requires\r\na certain amount of technical skill in order that the chlorine should\r\nnot act on the fibres themselves, but that its action should be limited\r\nto the colouring matter only. The fibre for making writing paper, for\r\ninstance, is bleached in this manner. The bleaching property of chlorine\r\nwas discovered by Berthollet, and forms an important acquisition to the\r\narts, because it has in the majority of cases replaced that which before\r\nwas the universal method of bleaching--namely, exposure to the sun of\r\nthe fabrics damped with water, which is still employed for linens, &c.\r\nTime and great trouble, and therefore money also, have been considerably\r\nsaved by this change.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] Ozone and peroxide of hydrogen also bleach tissues. As the action\r\n       of peroxide of hydrogen is easily controlled by taking a weak\r\n       solution, and as it has hardly any action upon the tissues\r\n       themselves, it is replacing chlorine more and more as a bleaching\r\n       agent. The oxidising property of chlorine is apparent in\r\n       destroying the majority of organic tissues, and proves fatal to\r\n       organisms. This action of chlorine is taken advantage of in\r\n       quarantine stations. But the simple fumigation by chlorine must be\r\n       carried on with great care in dwelling places, because chlorine\r\n       disengaged into the atmosphere renders it harmful to the health.\r\n\r\nThe power of chlorine for combination is intimately connected with\r\nits capacity for substitution, because, according to the law of\r\nsubstitution, if chlorine combines with hydrogen, then it also replaces\r\nhydrogen, and furthermore the combination and substitution are\r\naccomplished in the same quantities. Therefore _the atom of chlorine_\r\nwhich combines with the atom of hydrogen is also able _to replace the\r\natom of hydrogen_. We mention this property of chlorine not only because\r\nit illustrates the application of the law of substitution in clear and\r\nhistorically important examples, but more especially because reactions\r\nof this kind explain those _indirect methods_ of the formation of many\r\nsubstances which we have often mentioned and to which recourse is had\r\nin many cases in chemistry. Thus chlorine does not act on carbon,[20]\r\noxygen, or nitrogen, but nevertheless its compounds with these elements\r\nmay be obtained by the indirect method of the substitution of hydrogen\r\nby chlorine.\r\n\r\n  [20] A certain propensity of carbon to attract chlorine is evidenced in\r\n       the immense absorption of chlorine by charcoal (Note 7), but, so\r\n       far as is at present known (if I am not mistaken, no one has tried\r\n       the aid of light), no combination takes place between the chlorine\r\n       and carbon.\r\n\r\nAs chlorine easily combines with hydrogen, and does not act on carbon,\r\nit decomposes hydrocarbons (and many of their derivatives) at a high\r\ntemperature, depriving them of their hydrogen and liberating the carbon,\r\nas, for example, is clearly seen when a lighted candle is placed in a\r\nvessel containing chlorine. The flame becomes smaller, but continues\r\nto burn for a certain time, a large amount of soot is obtained, and\r\nhydrochloric acid is formed. In this case the gaseous and incandescent\r\nsubstances of the flame are decomposed by the chlorine, the hydrogen\r\ncombines with it, and the carbon is disengaged as soot.[21] This\r\naction of chlorine on hydrocarbons, &c., proceeds otherwise at lower\r\ntemperatures, as we will now consider.\r\n\r\n  [21] The same reaction takes place under the action of oxygen, with\r\n       the difference that it burns the carbon, which chlorine is not\r\n       able to do. If chlorine and oxygen compete together at a high\r\n       temperature, the oxygen will unite with the carbon, and the\r\n       chlorine with the hydrogen.\r\n\r\nA very important epoch in the history of chemistry was inaugurated by\r\nthe discovery of Dumas and Laurent that chlorine is able to displace\r\nand _replace hydrogen_. This discovery is important from the fact\r\nthat chlorine proved to be an element which combines with great ease\r\nsimultaneously with both the hydrogen and the element with which the\r\nhydrogen was combined. This clearly proved that there is no opposite\r\npolarity between elements forming stable compounds. Chlorine does not\r\ncombine with hydrogen because it has opposite properties, as Dumas and\r\nLaurent stated previously, accounting hydrogen to be electro-positive\r\nand chlorine electro-negative; this is not the reason of their combining\r\ntogether, for the same chlorine which combines with hydrogen is also\r\nable to replace it without altering many of the properties of the\r\nresultant substance. This substitution of hydrogen by chlorine is termed\r\n_metalepsis_. The mechanism of this substitution is very constant. If we\r\ntake a hydrogen compound, preferably a hydrocarbon, and if chlorine acts\r\ndirectly on it, then there is produced on the one hand hydrochloric acid\r\nand on the other hand a compound containing chlorine in the place of the\r\nhydrogen--so that the chlorine divides itself into two equal portions,\r\none portion is evolved as hydrochloric acid, and the other portion takes\r\nthe place of the hydrogen thus liberated. _Hence this metalepsis is\r\nalways accompanied by the formation of hydrochloric acid._[22] The scheme\r\nof the process is as follows:\r\n\r\n      C_{n}H_{m}X  +    Cl_{2}  =   C_{n}H_{m-1}ClX  +       HCl\r\n      Hydrocarbon        Free          Product of        Hydrochloric\r\n                       chlorine        metalepsis           acid\r\n\r\nOr, in general terms--\r\n\r\n                        RH + Cl_{2} = RCl + HCl.\r\n\r\n  [22] This division of chlorine into two portions may at the same time\r\n       be taken as a clear confirmation of the conception of molecules.\r\n       According to Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, the molecule of chlorine (p.\r\n       310) contains two atoms of this substance; one atom replaces\r\n       hydrogen, and the other combines with it.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which metalepsis takes place are also very\r\nconstant. In the dark chlorine does not usually act on hydrogen\r\ncompounds, but the action commences under the influence of light.\r\nThe direct action of the sun's rays is particularly propitious to\r\nmetalepsis. It is also remarkable that the presence of traces of certain\r\nsubstances,[23] especially of iodine, aluminium chloride, antimony\r\nchloride, &c., promotes the action. A trace of iodine added to the\r\nsubstance subjected to metalepsis often produces the same effect as\r\nsunlight.[24]\r\n\r\n  [23] Such carriers or media for the transference of chlorine and the\r\n       halogens in general were long known to exist in iodine and\r\n       antimonious chloride, and have been most fully studied by\r\n       Gustavson and Friedel, of the Petroffsky Academy--the former with\r\n       respect to aluminium bromide, and the latter with respect to\r\n       aluminium chloride. Gustavson showed that if a trace of metallic\r\n       aluminium be dissolved in bromine (it floats on bromine, and when\r\n       combination takes place much heat and light are evolved), the\r\n       latter becomes endowed with the property of entering into\r\n       metalepsis, which it is not able to do of its own accord. When\r\n       pure, for instance, it acts very slowly on benzene, C_{6}H_{6},\r\n       but in the presence of a trace of aluminium bromide the reaction\r\n       proceeds violently and easily, so that each drop of the\r\n       hydrocarbon gives a mass of hydrobromic acid, and of the product\r\n       of metalepsis. Gustavson showed that the _modus operandi_ of this\r\n       instructive reaction is based on the property of aluminium bromide\r\n       to enter into combination with hydrocarbons and their derivatives.\r\n       The details of this and all researches concerning the metalepsis\r\n       of the hydrocarbons must be looked for in works on organic\r\n       chemistry.\r\n\r\n  [24] As small admixtures of iodine, aluminium bromide, &c., aid the\r\n       metalepsis of large quantities of a substance, just as nitric\r\n       oxide aids the reaction of sulphurous anhydride on oxygen and\r\n       water, so the principle is essentially the same in both cases.\r\n       Effects of this kind (which should also be explained by a chemical\r\n       reaction proceeding at the surfaces) only differ from true contact\r\n       phenomena in that the latter are produced by solid bodies and are\r\n       accomplished at their surfaces, whilst in the former all is in\r\n       solution. Probably the action of iodine is founded on the\r\n       formation of iodine chloride, which reacts more easily than\r\n       chlorine.\r\n\r\nIf marsh gas be mixed with chlorine and the mixture ignited, then the\r\nhydrogen is entirely taken up from the marsh gas and hydrochloric\r\nacid and carbon formed, but there is no metalepsis.[25] But if a\r\nmixture of equal volumes of chlorine and marsh gas be exposed to the\r\naction of diffused light, then the greenish yellow mixture gradually\r\nbecomes colourless, and hydrochloric acid and the first product of\r\nmetalepsis--namely, methyl chloride--are formed:\r\n\r\n         CH_{4}    +    Cl_{2}  =      CH_{3}Cl      +       HCl\r\n        Marsh gas      Chlorine     Methyl chloride     Hydrochloric acid\r\n\r\n  [25] Metalepsis belongs to the number of delicate reactions--if it may\r\n       be so expressed--as compared with the energetic reaction of\r\n       combustion. Many cases of substitution are of this kind. Reactions\r\n       of metalepsis are accompanied by an evolution of heat, but in a\r\n       less quantity than that evolved in the formation of the resulting\r\n       quantity of the halogen acids. Thus the reaction C_{2}H_{6} +\r\n       Cl_{2} = C_{2}H_{5}Cl + HCl, according to the data given by\r\n       Thomsen, evolves about 20,000 heat units, whilst the formation of\r\n       hydrochloric acid evolves 22,000 units.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the mixture remains unaltered. The methyl chloride which\r\nis formed is a gas. If it be separated from the hydrochloric acid (it\r\nis soluble in acetic acid, in which hydrochloric acid is but sparingly\r\nsoluble) and be again mixed with chlorine, then it may be subjected\r\nto a further metalepsical substitution--the second atom of hydrogen\r\nmay be substituted by chlorine, and a liquid substance, CH_{2}Cl_{2},\r\ncalled methylene chloride, will be obtained. In the same manner\r\nthe substitution may be carried on still further, and CHCl_{3}, or\r\nchloroform, and lastly carbon tetrachloride, CCl_{4}, will be produced.\r\nOf these substances the best known is chloroform, owing to its being\r\nformed from many organic substances (by the action of bleaching powder)\r\nand to its being used in medicine as an anæsthetic; chloroform boils\r\nat 62° and carbon tetrachloride at 78°. They are both colourless\r\nodoriferous liquids, heavier than water. The progressive substitution of\r\nhydrogen by chlorine is thus evident, and it can be clearly seen that\r\nthe double decompositions are accomplished between molecular quantities\r\nof the substance--that is, between equal volumes in a gaseous state.\r\n\r\n_Carbon tetrachloride_, which is obtained by the metalepsis of marsh\r\ngas, cannot be obtained directly from chlorine and carbon, but it\r\nmay be obtained from certain compounds of carbon--for instance, from\r\ncarbon bisulphide--if its vapour mixed with chlorine be passed through\r\na red-hot tube. Both the sulphur and carbon then combine with the\r\nchlorine. It is evident that by ultimate metalepsis a corresponding\r\ncarbon chloride may be obtained from any hydrocarbon--indeed, the number\r\nof chlorides of carbon C_{_n_}Cl_{2_m_} already known is very large.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the fundamental chemical characters of hydrocarbons are not\r\nchanged by metalepsis; that is, if a neutral substance be taken, then\r\nthe product of metalepsis is also a neutral substance, or if an acid\r\nbe taken the product of metalepsis also has acid properties. Even the\r\ncrystalline form not unfrequently remains unaltered after metalepsis.\r\nThe metalepsis of acetic acid, CH_{3}·COOH, is historically the most\r\nimportant. It contains three of the atoms of the hydrogen of marsh gas,\r\nthe fourth being replaced by carboxyl, and therefore by the action of\r\nchlorine it gives three products of metalepsis (according to the amount\r\nof the chlorine and conditions under which the reaction takes place),\r\nmono-, di-, and tri-chloracetic acids--CH_{2}Cl·COOH, CHCl_{2}·COOH, and\r\nCCl_{3}·COOH; they are all, like acetic acid, monobasic. The resulting\r\nproducts of metalepsis, in containing an element which so easily acts\r\non metals as chlorine, possess the possibility of attaining a further\r\ncomplexity of molecules of which the original hydrocarbon is often in\r\nno way capable. Thus on treating with an alkali (or first with a salt\r\nand then with an alkali, or with a basic oxide and water, &c.) the\r\nchlorine forms a salt with its metal, and the hydroxyl radicle takes\r\nthe place of the chlorine--for example, CH_{3}·OH is obtained from\r\nCH_{3}Cl. By the action of metallic derivatives of hydrocarbons--for\r\nexample, CH_{3}Na--the chlorine also gives a salt, and the hydrocarbon\r\nradicle--for instance, CH_{3}--takes the place of the chlorine. In\r\nthis, or in a similar manner, CH_{3}·CH_{3}, or C_{2}H_{6} is obtained\r\nfrom CH_{3}Cl and C_{6}H_{5}·CH_{3} from C_{6}H_{6}. The products of\r\nmetalepsis also often react on ammonia, forming hydrochloric acid (and\r\nthence NH_{4}Cl) and an amide; that is, the product of metalepsis,\r\nwith the ammonia radicle NH_{2}, &c. in the place of chlorine. Thus\r\nby means of metalepsical substitution methods were found in chemistry\r\nfor an artificial and general means of the formation of complex carbon\r\ncompounds from more simple compounds which are often totally incapable\r\nof direct reaction. Besides which, this key opened the doors of that\r\nsecret edifice of complex organic compounds into which man had up to\r\nthen feared to enter, supposing the hydrocarbon elements to be united\r\nonly under the influence of those mystic forces acting in organisms.[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] With the predominance of the representation of compound radicles\r\n       (this doctrine dates from Lavoisier and Gay-Lussac) in organic\r\n       chemistry, it was a very important moment in its history when it\r\n       became possible to gain an insight into the structure of the\r\n       radicles themselves. It was clear, for instance, that ethyl,\r\n       C_{2}H_{5}, or the radicle of common alcohol, C_{2}H_{5}·OH,\r\n       passes, without changing, into a number of ethyl derivatives, but\r\n       its relation to the still simpler hydrocarbons was not clear, and\r\n       occupied the attention of science in the 'forties' and 'fifties.'\r\n       Having obtained ethyl hydride, C_{2}H_{5}H = C_{2}H_{6}, it was\r\n       looked on as containing the same ethyl, just as methyl hydride,\r\n       CH_{4} = CH_{3}H, was considered as existing in methane. Having\r\n       obtained free methyl, CH_{3}CH_{3} = C_{2}H_{6}, from it, it was\r\n       considered as a derivative of methyl alcohol, CH_{3}OH, and as\r\n       only isomeric with ethyl hydride. By means of the products of\r\n       metalepsis it was proved that this is not a case of isomerism but\r\n       of strict identity, and it therefore became clear that ethyl is\r\n       methylated methyl, C_{2}H_{5} = CH_{2}CH_{3}. In its time a still\r\n       greater impetus was given by the study of the reactions of\r\n       monochloracetic acid, CH_{2}Cl·COOH, or CO(CH_{2}Cl)(OH). It\r\n       appeared that metalepsical chlorine, like the chlorine of\r\n       chloranhydrides--for instance, of methyl chloride, CH_{3}Cl, or\r\n       ethyl chloride, C_{2}H_{5}Cl--is capable of substitution; for\r\n       example, glycollic acid, CH_{2}(OH)(CO_{2}H), or\r\n       CO(CH_{2}·OH)(OH), was obtained from it, and it appeared that the\r\n       OH in the group CH_{2}(OH) reacted like that in alcohols, and it\r\n       became clear, therefore, that it was necessary to examine the\r\n       radicles themselves by analysing them from the point of view of\r\n       the bonds connecting the constituent atoms. Whence arose the\r\n       present doctrine of the structure of the carbon compounds. (_See_\r\n       Chapter VIII., Note 42.)\r\n\r\nIt is not only hydrocarbons which are subject to metalepsis. Certain\r\nother hydrogen compounds, under the action of chlorine, also give\r\ncorresponding chlorine derivatives in exactly the same manner; for\r\ninstance, ammonia, caustic potash, caustic lime, and a whole series of\r\n_alkaline_ substances.[27] In fact, just as the hydrogen in marsh gas\r\ncan be replaced by chlorine and form methyl chloride, so the hydrogen\r\nin caustic potash, KHO, ammonia, NH_{3}, and calcium hydroxide,\r\nCaH_{2}O_{2} or Ca(OH)_{2}, may be replaced by chlorine and give\r\npotassium hypochlorite, KClO, calcium hypochlorite, CaCl_{2}O_{2},\r\nand the so-called chloride of nitrogen, NCl_{3}. For not only is the\r\ncorrelation in composition the same as in the substitution in marsh gas,\r\nbut the whole mechanism of the reaction is the same. Here also two atoms\r\nof chlorine act: one takes the place of the hydrogen whilst the other is\r\nevolved as hydrochloric acid, only in the former case the hydrochloric\r\nacid evolved remained free, and in the latter, in presence of alkaline\r\nsubstances, it reacts on them. Thus, in the action of chlorine on\r\ncaustic potash, the hydrochloric acid formed acts on another quantity of\r\ncaustic potash and gives potassium chloride and water, and therefore not\r\nonly KHO + Cl_{2} = HCl + KClO, but also KHO + HCl = H_{2}O + KCl, and\r\nthe result of both simultaneous phases will be 2KHO + Cl_{2} = H_{2}O +\r\nKCl + KClO. We will here discuss certain special cases.\r\n\r\n  [27] By including many instances of the action of chlorine under\r\n       metalepsis we not only explain the indirect formation of CCl_{4},\r\n       NCl_{3}, and Cl_{2}O by one method, but we also arrive at the fact\r\n       that the reactions of the metalepsis of the hydrocarbons lose that\r\n       exclusiveness which was often ascribed to them. Also by subjecting\r\n       the chemical representations to the law of substitution we may\r\n       foretell metalepsis as a particular case of a general law.\r\n\r\nThe action of chlorine on ammonia may either result in the entire\r\nbreaking up of the ammonia, with the evolution of gaseous nitrogen, or\r\nin a product of metalepsis (as with CH_{4}). With an excess of chlorine\r\nand the aid of heat the ammonia is decomposed, with the disengagement\r\nof free nitrogen.[28] This reaction evidently results in the formation\r\nof sal-ammoniac, 8NH_{3} + 3Cl_{2} = 6NH_{4}Cl + N_{2}. But if the\r\nammonium salt be in excess, then the reaction takes the direction of the\r\nreplacement of the hydrogen in the ammonia by chlorine. The principal\r\nresult is that NH_{3} + 3Cl_{2} forms NCl_{3} + 3HCl.[29] The resulting\r\nproduct of metalepsis, or _chloride of nitrogen_, NCl_{3}, discovered by\r\nDulong, is a liquid having the property of decomposing with excessive\r\nease not only when heated, but even under the action of mechanical\r\ninfluences, as by a blow or by contact with certain solid substances.\r\nThe explosion which accompanies the decomposition is due to the fact\r\nthat the liquid chloride of nitrogen gives gaseous products, nitrogen\r\nand chlorine.[29 bis]\r\n\r\n  [28] This may be taken advantage of in the preparation of nitrogen.\r\n       If a large excess of chlorine water be poured into a beaker, and a\r\n       small quantity of a solution of ammonia be added, then, after\r\n       shaking, nitrogen is evolved. If chlorine act on a dilute solution\r\n       of ammonia, the volume of nitrogen does not correspond with the\r\n       volume of the chlorine taken, because ammonium hypochlorite is\r\n       formed. If ammonia gas be passed through a fine orifice into a\r\n       vessel containing chlorine, the reaction of the formation of\r\n       nitrogen is accompanied by the emission of light and the\r\n       appearance of a cloud of sal-ammoniac. In all these instances an\r\n       excess of chlorine must be present.\r\n\r\n  [29] The hydrochloric acid formed combines with ammonia, and therefore\r\n       the final result is 4NH_{3} + 3Cl_{2} = NCl_{3} + 3NH_{4}Cl. For\r\n       this reason, more ammonia must enter into the reaction, but the\r\n       metalepsical reaction in reality only takes place with an excess\r\n       of ammonia or its salt. If bubbles of chlorine be passed through a\r\n       fine tube into a vessel containing ammonia gas, each bubble gives\r\n       rise to an explosion. If, however, chlorine be passed into a\r\n       solution of ammonia, the reaction at first brings about the\r\n       formation of nitrogen, because chloride of nitrogen acts on\r\n       ammonia like chlorine. But when sal-ammoniac has begun to form,\r\n       then the reaction directs itself towards the formation of chloride\r\n       of nitrogen. The first action of chlorine on a solution of\r\n       sal-ammoniac always causes the formation of chloride of nitrogen,\r\n       which then reacts on ammonia thus: NCl_{3} + 4NH_{3} = N_{2} +\r\n       3NH_{4}Cl. Therefore, so long as the liquid is alkaline from the\r\n       presence of ammonia the chief product will be nitrogen. The\r\n       reaction NH_{4}Cl + 3Cl_{2} = NCl_{3} + 4HCl is reversible; with a\r\n       dilute solution it proceeds in the above-described direction\r\n       (perhaps owing to the affinity of the hydrochloric acid for the\r\n       excess of water), but with a strong solution of hydrochloric acid\r\n       it takes the opposite direction (probably by virtue of the\r\n       affinity of hydrochloric acid for ammonia). Therefore there must\r\n       exist a very interesting case of equilibrium between ammonia,\r\n       hydrochloric acid, chlorine, water, and chloride of nitrogen which\r\n       has not yet been investigated. The reaction NCl_{3} + 4HCl =\r\n       NH_{4}Cl + 3Cl_{2} enabled Deville and Hautefeuille to determine\r\n       the composition of chloride of nitrogen. When slowly decomposed by\r\n       water, chloride of nitrogen gives, like a chloranhydride, nitrous\r\n       acid or its anhydride, 2NCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O = N_{2}O_{3} + 6HCl.\r\n       From these observations it is evident that chloride of nitrogen\r\n       presents great chemical interest, which is strengthened by its\r\n       analogy with trichloride of phosphorus. The researches of F. F.\r\n       Selivanoff (1891-94) prove that NCl_{3} may be regarded as an\r\n       ammonium derivative of hypochlorous acid. Chloride of nitrogen is\r\n       decomposed by dilute sulphuric acid in the following manner:\r\n       NCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O + H_{2}SO_{4} = NH_{4}HSO_{4} + 3HClO. This\r\n       reaction is reversible and is only complete when some substance,\r\n       combining with HClO (for instance, succinimide) or decomposing it,\r\n       is added to the liquid. This is easily understood from the fact\r\n       that hypochlorous acid itself, HClO, may, according to the view\r\n       held in this book, be regarded as the product of the metalepsis of\r\n       water, and consequently bears the same relation to NCl_{3} as\r\n       H_{2}O does to NH_{3}, or as RHO to RNH_{2}, R_{2}NH, and\r\n       R_{3}N--that is to say, NCl_{3} corresponds as an ammonium\r\n       derivative to ClOH and Cl_{2} in exactly the same manner as NR_{3}\r\n       corresponds to ROH and R_{2}. The connection of NCl_{3} and other\r\n       similar explosive chloro-nitrogen compounds (called chloryl\r\n       compounds by Selivanoff; for example, the C_{2}H_{5}NCl_{2} of\r\n       Wurtz is chloryl ethylamine), such as NRCl_{2} (as\r\n       NC_{2}H_{5}Cl_{2}), and NR_{2}Cl (for instance, N(CH_{3}CO)HCl,\r\n       chlorylacetamide, and N(C_{2}H_{5})_{2}Cl, chloryl diethylamine)\r\n       with HClO is evident from the fact that under certain\r\n       circumstances these compounds give hypochlorous acid, with water,\r\n       for instance, NR_{2}Cl + H_{2}O = NR_{2}H + HClO, and frequently\r\n       act (like NCl_{3} and HClO, or Cl_{2}) in an oxidising and\r\n       chloridising manner. We may take chloryl succinimide,\r\n       C_{2}H_{4}(CO)_{2}NCl for example. It was obtained by Bender by\r\n       the action of HClO upon succinimide, C_{2}H_{4}(CO)_{2}NH, and is\r\n       decomposed by water with the re-formation of amide and HClO (the\r\n       reaction is reversible). Selivanoff obtained, investigated, and\r\n       classified many of the compounds NR_{2}Cl and NRCl_{2}, where R is\r\n       a residue of organic acids or alcohols, and showed their\r\n       distinction from the chloranhydrides, and thus supplemented the\r\n       history of chloride of nitrogen, which is the simplest of the\r\n       amides containing chlorine, NR_{3}, where R is fully substituted\r\n       by chlorine.\r\n\r\n  [29 bis] In preparing NCl_{3} every precaution must he used to guard\r\n       against an explosion, and care should he taken that the NCl_{3}\r\n       remains under a layer of water. Whenever an ammoniacal substance\r\n       comes into contact with chlorine great care must be taken, because\r\n       it may be a case of the formation of such products and a very\r\n       dangerous explosion may ensue. The liquid product of the\r\n       metalepsis of ammonia may be most safely prepared in the form of\r\n       small drops by the action of a galvanic current on a slightly warm\r\n       solution of sal-ammoniac; chlorine is then evolved at the positive\r\n       pole, and this chlorine acting on the ammonia gradually forms the\r\n       product of metalepsis which floats on the surface of the liquid\r\n       (being carried up by the gas), and if a layer of turpentine be\r\n       poured on to it these small drops, on coming into contact with the\r\n       turpentine, give feeble explosions, which are in no way dangerous\r\n       owing to the small mass of the substance formed. Drops of chloride\r\n       of nitrogen may with great caution be collected for investigation\r\n       in the following manner. The neck of a funnel is immersed in a\r\n       basin containing mercury, and first a saturated solution of common\r\n       salt is poured into the funnel, and above it a solution of\r\n       sal-ammoniac in 9 parts of water. Chlorine is then slowly passed\r\n       through the solutions, when drops of chloride of nitrogen fall\r\n       into the salt water.\r\n\r\nChloride of nitrogen is a yellow oily liquid of sp. gr. 1·65, which\r\nboils at 71°, and breaks up into N + Cl_{3} at 97°. The contact of\r\nphosphorus, turpentine, india-rubber, &c. causes an explosion, which\r\nis sometimes so violent that a small drop will pierce through a thick\r\nboard. The great ease with which chloride of nitrogen decomposes is\r\ndependent upon the fact that it is formed with an absorption of heat,\r\nwhich it evolves when decomposed, to the amount of about 38,000 heat\r\nunits for NCl_{3}, as Deville and Hautefeuille determined.\r\n\r\nChlorine, when absorbed by a solution of caustic soda (and also of other\r\nalkalis) at the ordinary temperature, causes the replacement of the\r\nhydrogen in the caustic soda by the chlorine, with the formation of\r\nsodium chloride by the hydrochloric acid, so that the reaction may be\r\nrepresented in two phases, as described above. In this manner, sodium\r\nhypochlorite, NaClO, and sodium chloride are simultaneously formed: 2NaHO\r\n+ Cl_{2} = NaCl + NaClO + H_{2}O. The resultant solution contains NaClO\r\nand is termed 'eau de Javelle.' An exactly similar reaction takes place\r\nwhen chlorine is passed over dry hydrate of lime at the ordinary\r\ntemperature: 2Ca(HO)_{2} + 2Cl_{2} = CaCl_{2}O_{2} + CaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O.\r\nA mixture of the product of metalepsis with calcium chloride is obtained.\r\nThis mixture is employed in practice on a large scale, and is termed\r\n'bleaching powder,' owing to its acting, especially when mixed with\r\nacids, as a bleaching agent on tissues, so that it resembles chlorine in\r\nthis respect. It is however preferable to chlorine, because the\r\ndestructive action of the chlorine can be moderated in this case, and\r\nbecause it is much more convenient to deal with a solid substance than\r\nwith gaseous chlorine. Bleaching powder is also called _chloride of\r\nlime_, because it is obtained from chlorine and hydrate of lime, and\r\ncontains[30] both these substances. It may be prepared in the laboratory\r\nby passing a current of chlorine through a cold mixture of water and lime\r\n(milk of lime). The mixture must be kept cold, as otherwise 3Ca(ClO)_{2}\r\npasses into 2CaCl_{2} + Ca(ClO_{3})_{2}. In the manufacture of bleaching\r\npowder in large quantities at chemical works, the purest possible slaked\r\nlime is taken and laid in a thin layer in large flat chambers, M (whose\r\nwalls are made of Yorkshire flags or tarred wood, on which chlorine has\r\nno action), and into which chlorine gas is introduced by lead tubes. The\r\ndistribution of the plant is shown in the annexed drawing (fig. 67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Apparatus for the manufacture of bleaching\r\npowder (on a small scale) by the action of chlorine, which is generated\r\nin the vessels C, on lime, which is charged into M.]\r\n\r\n  [30] Quicklime, CaO (or calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}), does not absorb\r\n       chlorine when cold, but at a red heat, in a current of chlorine,\r\n       it forms calcium chloride, with the evolution of oxygen. (This was\r\n       confirmed in 1893 by Wells, at Oxford.) This reaction corresponds\r\n       with the decomposing action of chlorine on methane, ammonia, and\r\n       water. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide, CaH_{2}O_{2}) also, when\r\n       dry, does not absorb chlorine at 100°. The absorption proceeds at\r\n       the ordinary temperature (below 40°). The dry mass thus obtained\r\n       contains not less than three equivalents of calcium hydroxide to\r\n       four equivalents of chlorine, so that its composition is\r\n       [Ca(HO)_{2}]_{5}Cl_{4}. In all probability a simple absorption of\r\n       chlorine by the lime at first takes place in this case, as may be\r\n       seen from the fact that even carbonic anhydride, when acting on\r\n       the dry mass obtained as above, disengages all the chlorine from\r\n       it, leaving only calcium carbonate. But if the bleaching powder be\r\n       obtained by a wet method, or if it be dissolved in water (in which\r\n       it is very soluble), and carbonic anhydride be passed into it,\r\n       then chlorine is no longer disengaged, but chlorine oxide,\r\n       Cl_{2}O, and only half of the chlorine is converted into this\r\n       oxide, while the other half remains in the liquid as calcium\r\n       chloride. From this it may be inferred that calcium chloride is\r\n       formed by the action of water on bleaching powder, and this is\r\n       proved to be the case by the fact that small quantities of water\r\n       extract a considerable amount of calcium chloride from bleaching\r\n       powder. If a large quantity of water act on bleaching powder an\r\n       excess of calcium hydroxide remains, a portion of which is not\r\n       subjected to change. The action of the water may be expressed by\r\n       the following formulæ: From the dry mass Ca_{3}(HO)_{6}Cl_{4}\r\n       there is formed lime, Ca(HO)_{2}, calcium chloride, CaCl_{2}, and\r\n       a saline substance, Ca(ClO)_{2}. Ca_{3}H_{6}O_{6}Cl_{4} =\r\n       CaH_{2}O_{2} + CaCl_{2}O_{2} + CaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O. The resulting\r\n       substances are not equally soluble; water first extracts the\r\n       calcium chloride, which is the most soluble, then the compound\r\n       Ca(ClO)_{2} and ultimately calcium hydroxide is left. A mixture of\r\n       calcium chloride and hypochlorite passes into solution. On\r\n       evaporation there remains Ca_{2}O_{2}Cl_{4}3H_{2}O. The dry\r\n       bleaching powder does not absorb more chlorine, but the solution\r\n       is able to absorb it in considerable quantity. If the liquid be\r\n       boiled, a considerable amount of chlorine monoxide is evolved.\r\n       After this calcium chloride alone remains in solution, and the\r\n       decomposition may be expressed as follows: CaCl_{2} +\r\n       CaCl_{2}O_{2} + 2Cl_{2} = 2CaCl_{2} + 2Cl_{2}O. Chlorine monoxide\r\n       may be prepared in this manner.\r\n\r\n       It is sometimes said that bleaching powder contains a substance,\r\n       Ca(OH)_{2}Cl_{2}, that is calcium peroxide, CaO_{2}, in which one\r\n       atom of oxygen is replaced by (OH)_{2}, and the other by Cl_{2};\r\n       but, judging from what has been said above, this can only be the\r\n       case in the dry state, and not in solutions.\r\n\r\n       On being kept for some time, bleaching powder sometimes\r\n       decomposes, with the evolution of oxygen (because CaCl_{2}O_{2} =\r\n       CaCl_{2} + O_{2}, _see_ p. 163); the same takes place when it is\r\n       heated.\r\n\r\nThe products of the metalepsis of alkaline hydrates, NaClO and\r\nCa(ClO)_{2}, which are present in solutions of 'Javelle salt' and\r\nbleaching powder (they are not obtained free from metallic chlorides),\r\nmust be counted as salts, because their metals are capable of\r\nsubstitution. But the hydrate HClO corresponding with these salts,\r\nor _hypochlorous acid_, is not obtained in a free or pure state, for\r\ntwo reasons: in the first place, because this hydrate, as a very\r\nfeeble acid, splits up (like H_{2}CO_{3} or HNO_{3}) into water and the\r\nanhydride, or _chlorine monoxide_, Cl_{2}O = 2HClO-H_{2}O; and, in the\r\nsecond place, because, in a number of instances, it evolves oxygen\r\nwith great facility, forming hydrochloric acid: HClO = HCl + O. Both\r\nhypochlorous acid and chlorine monoxide may be regarded as products of\r\nthe metalepsis of water, because HOH corresponds with ClOH and ClOCl.\r\nHence in many instances bleaching salts (a mixture of hypochlorites and\r\nchlorides) break up, with the evolution of (1) _chlorine_, under the\r\naction of an excess of a powerful acid capable of evolving hydrochloric\r\nacid from sodium or calcium chlorides, and this takes place most simply\r\nunder the action of hydrochloric acid itself, because (p. 462) NaCl +\r\nNaClO + 3HCl = 2NaCl + HCl + Cl_{2} + H_{2}O; (2) _oxygen_, as we saw\r\nin Chapter III.--The bleaching properties and, in general, _oxidising\r\naction_ of bleaching salts is based on this evolution of oxygen (or\r\nchlorine); oxygen is also disengaged on heating the dry salts--for\r\ninstance, NaCl + NaClO = 2NaCl + O; (3) and, lastly, _chlorine\r\nmonoxide_, which contains both chlorine and oxygen. Thus, if a little\r\nsulphuric, nitric, or similar acid (not enough to liberate hydrochloric\r\nacid from the CaCl_{2}) be added to a solution of a bleaching salt\r\n(which has an alkaline reaction, owing either to an excess of alkali\r\nor to the feeble acid properties of HClO), then the hypochlorous acid\r\nset free gives water and chlorine monoxide. If carbonic anhydride\r\n(or boracic or a similar very feeble acid) act on the solution of a\r\nbleaching salt, then hydrochloric acid is not evolved from the sodium\r\nor calcium chlorides, but the hypochlorous acid is displaced and gives\r\nchlorine monoxide,[31] because hypochlorous acid is one of the most\r\nfeeble acids. Another method for the preparation of chlorine monoxide\r\nis based on these feeble acid properties of hypochlorous acid. Zinc\r\noxide and mercury oxide, under the action of chlorine in the presence\r\nof water, do not give a salt of hypochlorous acid, but form a chloride\r\nand hypochlorous acid, which fact shows the incapacity of this acid to\r\ncombine with the bases mentioned. Therefore, if such oxides as those of\r\nzinc or mercury be shaken up in water, and chlorine be passed through\r\nthe turbid liquid,[32] a reaction occurs which may be expressed in the\r\nfollowing manner: 2HgO + 2Cl_{2} = Hg_{2}OCl_{2} + Cl_{2}O. In this case,\r\na compound of mercury oxide with mercury chloride, or the so-called\r\nmercury oxychloride, is obtained: Hg_{2}OCl_{2} = HgO + HgCl_{2}. This is\r\ninsoluble in water, and is not affected by hypochlorous anhydride, so\r\nthat the solution will contain hypochlorous acid only, but the greater\r\npart of it splits up into the anhydride and water.[32 bis]\r\n\r\n  [31] For this reason it is necessary that in the preparation of\r\n       bleaching powder the chlorine should be free from hydrochloric\r\n       acid, and even the lime from calcium chloride. An excess of\r\n       chlorine, in acting on a solution of bleaching powder, may also\r\n       give chlorine monoxide, because calcium carbonate also gives\r\n       chlorine monoxide under the action of chlorine. This reaction may\r\n       be brought about by treating freshly precipitated calcium\r\n       carbonate with a stream of chlorine in water: 2Cl_{2} + CaCO_{3} =\r\n       CO_{2} + CaCl_{2} + Cl_{2}O. From this we may conclude that,\r\n       although carbonic anhydride displaces hypochlorous anhydride, it\r\n       may be itself displaced by an excess of the latter.\r\n\r\n  [32] Dry red mercury oxide acts on chlorine, forming dry hypochlorous\r\n       anhydride (chlorine monoxide) (Balard); when mixed with water, red\r\n       mercury oxide acts feebly on chlorine, and when freshly\r\n       precipitated it evolves oxygen and chlorine. An oxide of mercury\r\n       which easily and abundantly evolves chlorine monoxide under the\r\n       action of chlorine in the presence of water may be prepared as\r\n       follows: the oxide of mercury, precipitated from a mercuric salt\r\n       by an alkali, is heated to 300° and cooled (Pelouze). If a salt,\r\n       MClO, be added to a solution of mercuric salt, HgX_{2}, mercuric\r\n       oxide is liberated, because the hypochlorite is decomposed.\r\n\r\n  [32 bis] A solution of hypochlorous anhydride is also obtained by the\r\n       action of chlorine on many salts; for example, in the action of\r\n       chlorine on a solution of sodium sulphate the following reaction\r\n       takes place: Na_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O + Cl_{2} = NaCl + HClO +\r\n       NaHSO_{4}. Here the hypochlorous acid is formed, together with\r\n       HCl, at the expense of chlorine and water, for Cl_{2} + H_{2}O =\r\n       HCl + HClO. If the crystallo-hydrate of chlorine be mixed with\r\n       mercury oxide, the hydrochloric acid formed in the reaction gives\r\n       mercury chloride, and hypochlorous acid remains in solution. A\r\n       dilute solution of hypochlorous acid or chlorine monoxide may be\r\n       concentrated by distillation, and if a substance which takes up\r\n       water (without destroying the acid)--for instance, calcium\r\n       nitrate--be added to the stronger solution, then the anhydride of\r\n       hypochlorous acid--_i.e._ chlorine monoxide--is disengaged.\r\n\r\nChlorine monoxide, which corresponds to bleaching and hypochlorous\r\nsalts, containing as it does the two elements oxygen and chlorine,\r\nforms a characteristic example of a compound of elements which, in the\r\nmajority of cases, act chemically in an analogous manner. Chlorine\r\nmonoxide, as prepared from an aqueous solution by the abstraction of\r\nwater or by the action of dry chlorine on cold mercury oxide, is, at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, a gas or vapour which condenses into a red\r\nliquid boiling at +20° and giving a vapour whose density (43 referred\r\nto hydrogen) shows that 2 vols. of chlorine and 1 vol. of oxygen\r\ngive 2 vols. of chlorine monoxide. In an anhydrous form the gas or\r\nliquid easily explodes, splitting up into chlorine and oxygen. This\r\nexplosiveness is determined by the fact that heat is _evolved_ in the\r\ndecomposition to the amount of about 15,000 heat units for Cl_{2}O.[33]\r\nThe explosion may even take place spontaneously, and also in the\r\npresence of many oxidisable substances (for instance, sulphur, organic\r\ncompounds, &c.), but the solution, although unstable and showing a\r\nstrong oxidising tendency, does not explode.[34] It is evident that\r\nthe presence of hypochlorous acid, HClO, may be assumed in an aqueous\r\nsolution of Cl_{2}O, since Cl_{2}O + H_{2}O = 2HClO.\r\n\r\n  [33] All explosive substances are of this kind--ozone, hydrogen\r\n       peroxide, chloride of nitrogen, nitro-compounds, &c. Hence they\r\n       cannot be formed directly from the elements or their simplest\r\n       compounds, but, on the contrary, decompose into them. In a liquid\r\n       state chlorine monoxide explodes even on contact with powdery\r\n       substances, or when rapidly agitated--for instance, if a file be\r\n       rasped over the vessel in which it is contained.\r\n\r\n  [34] A solution of chlorine monoxide, or hypochlorous acid, does not\r\n       explode, owing to the presence of the mass of water. In\r\n       dissolving, chlorine monoxide evolves about 9,000 heat units, so\r\n       that its store of heat becomes less.\r\n\r\n       The capacity of hypochlorous acid (studied by Carius and others)\r\n       for entering into combination with the unsaturated hydrocarbons is\r\n       very often taken advantage of in organic chemistry. Thus its\r\n       solution absorbs ethylene, forming the chlorhydrin C_{2}H_{4}ClOH.\r\n\r\n       The oxidising action of hypochlorous acid and its salts is not\r\n       only applied to bleaching but also to many reactions of oxidation.\r\n       Thus it converts the lower oxides of manganese into the peroxide.\r\n\r\nHypochlorous acid, its salts, and chlorine monoxide serve as a transition\r\nbetween hydrochloric acid, chlorides, and chlorine, and a whole series of\r\ncompounds containing the same elements combined with a still greater\r\nquantity of oxygen. The higher oxides of chlorine, as their origin\r\nindicates, are closely connected with hypochlorous acid and its salts:\r\n\r\n         Cl_{2},       NaCl,       HCl,       hydrochloric acid.\r\n         Cl_{2}O,      NaClO,      HClO,      hypochlorous acid.\r\n         Cl_{2}O_{3},  NaClO_{2},  HClO_{2},  chlorous acid.[35]\r\n         Cl_{2}O_{5},  NaClO_{3},  HClO_{3},  chloric acid.\r\n         Cl_{2}O_{7},  NaClO_{4},  HClO_{4},  perchloric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen heated, solutions of hypochlorites undergo a remarkable change.\r\nThemselves so unstable, they, without any further addition, yield two\r\nfresh salts which are both much more stable; one contains more oxygen\r\nthan MClO, the other contains none at all.\r\n\r\n                     3MClO       =   MClO_{3} +    2MCl\r\n                  hypochlorite       chlorate    chloride\r\n\r\n  [35] _Chlorous acid_, HClO_{2} (according to the data given by Millon,\r\n       Brandau, and others) in many respects resembles hypochlorous acid,\r\n       HClO, whilst they both differ from chloric and perchloric acids in\r\n       their degree of stability, which is expressed, for instance, in\r\n       their bleaching properties; the two higher acids do not bleach,\r\n       but both the lower ones do so (oxidise at the ordinary\r\n       temperature). On the other hand, chlorous acid is analogous to\r\n       nitrous acid, HNO_{2}. The anhydride of chlorous acid,\r\n       Cl_{2}O_{3}, is not known in a pure state, but it probably occurs\r\n       in admixture with chlorine dioxide, ClO_{2}, which is obtained by\r\n       the action of nitric and sulphuric acids on a mixture of potassium\r\n       chlorate with such reducing substances as nitric oxide, arsenious\r\n       oxide, sugar, &c. All that is at present known is that pure\r\n       chlorine dioxide ClO_{2} (_see_ Notes 39-43) is gradually\r\n       converted into a mixture of hypochlorous and chlorous acids under\r\n       the action of water (and alkalis); that is, it acts like nitric\r\n       peroxide, NO_{2} (giving HNO_{3} and HNO_{2}), or as a mixed\r\n       anhydride, 2ClO_{2} + H_{2}O = HClO_{3} + HClO_{2}. The silver\r\n       salt, AgClO_{2}, is sparingly soluble in water. The investigations\r\n       of Garzarolli-Thurnlackh and others seem to show that the\r\n       anhydride Cl_{2}O_{3} does not exist in a free state.\r\n\r\nPart of the salt--namely, two-thirds of it--parts with its oxygen in\r\norder to oxidise the remaining third.[36] From an intermediate substance,\r\nRX, two extremes, R and RX_{3} are formed, just as nitrous anhydride\r\nsplits up into nitric oxide and nitric anhydride (or nitric acid). The\r\nresulting salt, MClO_{3}, corresponds with _chloric acid_ and potassium\r\nchlorate, KClO_{3}. It is evident that a similar salt may be obtained\r\ndirectly by the action of chlorine on an alkali if its solution be\r\nheated, because RClO will be first formed, and then RClO_{3}; for\r\nexample, 6KHO + 3Cl_{2} = KClO_{3} + 5KCl + 3H_{2}O. Chlorates are so\r\nprepared; for instance, _potassium chlorate_, which is easily separated\r\nfrom potassium chloride, being sparingly soluble in cold water.[37]\r\n\r\n  [36] Hydrochloric acid, which is an example of compounds of this kind,\r\n       is a saturated substance which does not combine directly with\r\n       oxygen, but in which, nevertheless, a considerable quantity of\r\n       oxygen may be inserted between the elements forming it. The same\r\n       may be observed in a number of other cases. Thus oxygen may be\r\n       added or inserted between the elements, sometimes in considerable\r\n       quantities, in the saturated hydrocarbons; for instance, in\r\n       C_{3}H_{8}, three atoms of oxygen produce an alcohol, glycerin or\r\n       glycerol, C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3}. We shall meet with similar examples\r\n       hereafter. This is generally explained by regarding oxygen as a\r\n       bivalent element--that is, as capable of combining with two\r\n       different elements, such as chlorine, hydrogen, &c. On the basis\r\n       of this view, it may be inserted between each pair of combined\r\n       elements; the oxygen will then be combined with one of the\r\n       elements by one of its affinities and with the other element by\r\n       its other affinity. This view does not, however, express the\r\n       entire truth of the matter, even when applied to the compounds of\r\n       chlorine. Hypochlorous acid, HOCl--that is, hydrochloric acid in\r\n       which one atom of oxygen is inserted--is, as we have already seen,\r\n       a substance of small stability; it might therefore be expected\r\n       that on the addition of a fresh quantity of oxygen, a still less\r\n       stable substance would be obtained, because, according to the\r\n       above view, the chlorine and hydrogen, which form such a stable\r\n       compound together, are then still further removed from each other.\r\n       But it appears that chloric and perchloric acid, HClO_{3} and\r\n       HClO_{4}, are much more stable substances. Furthermore, the\r\n       addition of oxygen has also its limit, it can only be added to a\r\n       certain extent. If the above representation were true and not\r\n       merely hypothetical, there would be no limit to the combination of\r\n       oxygen, and the more it entered into one continuous chain the more\r\n       unstable would be the resultant compound. But not more than four\r\n       atoms of oxygen can be added to hydrogen sulphide, nor to\r\n       hydrochloric acid, nor to hydrogen phosphide. This peculiarity\r\n       must lie in the properties of oxygen itself; four atoms of oxygen\r\n       seem to have the power of forming a kind of radicle which retains\r\n       two or several atoms of various other substances--for example,\r\n       chlorine and hydrogen, hydrogen and sulphur, sodium and manganese,\r\n       phosphorus and metals, &c., forming comparatively stable\r\n       compounds, NaClO_{4}, Na_{2}SO_{4}, NaMnO_{4}, Na_{3}PO_{4}, &c.\r\n       _See_ Chapter X. Note 1 and Chapter XV.\r\n\r\n  [37] If chlorine be passed through a _cold_ solution of potash, a\r\n       bleaching compound, potassium chloride and hypochlorite, KCl +\r\n       KClO, is formed, but if it be passed through a _hot_ solution\r\n       potassium chlorate is formed. As this is sparingly soluble in\r\n       water, it chokes the gas-conducting tube, which should therefore\r\n       be widened out at the end.\r\n\r\n       Potassium chlorate is usually obtained on a large scale from\r\n       calcium chlorate, which is prepared by passing chlorine (as long\r\n       as it is absorbed) into water containing lime, the mixture being\r\n       kept warm. A mixture of calcium chlorate and chloride is thus\r\n       formed in the solution. Potassium chloride is then added to the\r\n       warm solution, and on cooling a precipitate of potassium chlorate\r\n       is formed as a substance which is sparingly soluble in cold water,\r\n       especially in the presence of other salts. The double\r\n       decomposition taking place is Ca(ClO_{3})_{2} + 2KCl = CaCl_{2} +\r\n       2KClO_{3}. On a small scale in the laboratory potassium chlorate\r\n       is best prepared from a strong solution of bleaching powder by\r\n       passing chlorine through it and then adding potassium chloride.\r\n       KClO_{3} is always formed by the action of an electric current on\r\n       a solution of KCl, especially at 80° (Häussermann and Naschold,\r\n       1894), so that this method is now used on a large scale.\r\n\r\n       Potassium chlorate crystallises easily in large colourless tabular\r\n       crystals. Its solubility in 100 parts of water at 0° = 3 parts,\r\n       20° = 8 parts, 40° = 14 parts, 60° = 25 parts, 80° = 40 parts. For\r\n       comparison we will cite the following figures showing the\r\n       solubility of potassium chloride and perchlorate in 100 parts of\r\n       water: potassium chloride at O° = 28 parts, 20° = 35 parts, 40° =\r\n       40 parts, 100° = 57 parts; potassium perchlorate at 0° about 1\r\n       part, 20° about 1-3/4 part, 100° about 18 parts. When heated,\r\n       potassium chlorate melts (the melting point has been given as from\r\n       335°-376°; according to the latest determination by Carnelley,\r\n       359°) and decomposes with the evolution of oxygen, potassium\r\n       perchlorate being at first formed, as will afterwards be described\r\n       (_see_ Note 47). A mixture of potassium chlorate and nitric and\r\n       hydrochloric acids effects oxidation and chlorination in\r\n       solutions. It deflagrates when thrown upon incandescent carbon,\r\n       and when mixed with sulphur (1/3 by weight) it ignites it on being\r\n       struck, in which case an explosion takes place. The same occurs\r\n       with many metallic sulphides and organic substances. Such mixtures\r\n       are also ignited by a drop of sulphuric acid. All these effects\r\n       are due to the large amount of oxygen contained in potassium\r\n       chlorate, and to the ease with which it is evolved. A mixture of\r\n       two parts of potassium chlorate, one part of sugar, and one part\r\n       of yellow prussiate of potash acts like gunpowder, but burns too\r\n       rapidly, and therefore bursts the guns, and it also has a very\r\n       strong oxidising action on their metal. The sodium salt,\r\n       NaClO_{3}, is much more soluble than the potassium salt, and it is\r\n       therefore more difficult to free it from sodium chloride, &c. The\r\n       barium salt is also more soluble than the potassium salt; O° = 24\r\n       parts, 20° = 37 parts, 80° = 98 parts of salt per 100 of water.\r\n\r\nIf dilute sulphuric acid be added to a solution of potassium chlorate,\r\n_chloric acid_ is liberated, but it cannot be separated by distillation,\r\nas it is decomposed in the process. To obtain the free acid, sulphuric\r\nacid must be added to a solution of barium chlorate.[38] The sulphuric\r\nacid gives a precipitate of barium sulphate, and free chloric acid\r\nremains in solution. The solution may be evaporated under the receiver of\r\nan air-pump. This solution is colourless, has no smell, and acts as a\r\npowerful acid (it neutralises sodium hydroxide, decomposes sodium\r\ncarbonate, gives hydrogen with zinc, &c.); when heated above 40°,\r\nhowever, it decomposes, forming chlorine, oxygen, and perchloric acid:\r\n4HClO_{3} = 2HClO_{4} + H_{2}O + Cl_{2} + O_{3}. In a concentrated\r\ncondition the acid acts as an exceedingly energetic oxidiser, so that\r\norganic substances brought into contact with it burst into flame. Iodine,\r\nsulphurous acid, and similar oxidisable substances form higher oxidation\r\nproducts and reduce the chloric acid to hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric\r\nacid gas gives chlorine with chloric acid (and consequently with\r\nKClO_{3} also) acting in the same manner as it acts on the lower acids:\r\nHClO_{3} + 5HCl = 3H_{2}O + 3Cl_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [38] Barium chlorate, Ba(ClO_{3})_{2},H_{2}O, is prepared in the\r\n       following way: impure chloric acid is first prepared and saturated\r\n       with baryta, and the barium salt purified by crystallisation. The\r\n       impure free chloric acid is obtained by converting the potassium\r\n       in potassium chlorate into an insoluble salt. This is done by\r\n       adding tartaric or hydrofluosilicic acid to a solution of\r\n       potassium chlorate, because potassium tartrate and potassium\r\n       silicofluoride are very sparingly soluble in water. Chloric acid\r\n       is easily soluble in water.\r\n\r\nBy cautiously acting on potassium chlorate with sulphuric acid, the\r\n_dioxide_ (_chloric peroxide_), ClO_{2},[39] is obtained (Davy, Millon).\r\nThis gas is easily liquefied in a freezing mixture, and boils at +10°.\r\nThe vapour density (about 35 if H = 1) shows that the molecule of this\r\nsubstance is ClO_{2}.[40] In a gaseous or liquid state it very easily\r\nexplodes (for instance, at 60°, or by contact with organic compounds or\r\nfinely divided substances, &c.), forming Cl and O_{2}, and in many\r\ninstances[41] therefore it acts as an oxidising agent, although (like\r\nnitric peroxide) it may itself be further oxidised.[42] In dissolving in\r\nwater or alkalis chloric peroxide gives chlorous and hypochlorous\r\nacids--2ClO_{2} + 2KHO = KClO_{3} + KClO_{2} + H_{2}O--and therefore,\r\nlike nitric peroxide, the dioxide may be regarded as an intermediate\r\noxide between the (unknown) anhydrides of chlorous and chloric acids:\r\n4ClO_{2} = Cl_{2}O_{3} + Cl_{2}O_{3}.[43]\r\n\r\n  [39] To prepare ClO_{2} 100 grams of sulphuric acid are cooled in a\r\n       mixture of ice and salt, and 15 grams of powdered potassium\r\n       chlorate are gradually added to the acid, which is then carefully\r\n       distilled at 20° to 40°, the vapour given off being condensed in a\r\n       freezing mixture. Potassium perchlorate is then formed: 3KClO_{3}\r\n       + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = 2KHSO_{4} + KClO_{4} + 2ClO_{2} + H_{2}O. The\r\n       reaction may result in an explosion. Calvert and Davies obtained\r\n       chloric peroxide without the least danger by heating a mixture of\r\n       oxalic acid and potassium chlorate in a test tube in a water-bath.\r\n       In this case 2KClO_{3} + 3C_{2}H_{2}O_{4},2H_{2}O = 2C_{2}HKO_{4}\r\n       + 2CO_{2} + 2ClO_{2} + 8H_{2}O. The reaction is still further\r\n       facilitated by the addition of a small quantity of sulphuric acid.\r\n       If a solution of HCl acts upon KClO_{3} at the ordinary\r\n       temperature, a mixture of Cl_{2} and ClO_{2} is formed, but if the\r\n       temperature be raised to 80° the greater part of the ClO_{2}\r\n       decomposes, and when passed through a hot solution of MnCl_{2} it\r\n       oxidises it. Gooch and Kreider proposed (1894) to employ this\r\n       method for preparing small quantities of chlorine in the\r\n       laboratory.\r\n\r\n  [40] By analogy with nitric peroxide it might be expected that at low\r\n       temperatures a doubling of the molecule into Cl_{2}O_{4} would\r\n       take place, as the reactions of ClO_{2} point to its being a mixed\r\n       anhydride of HClO_{2} and HClO_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [41] Owing to the formation of this chlorine dioxide, a mixture of\r\n       potassium chlorate and sugar is ignited by a drop of sulphuric\r\n       acid. This property was formerly made use of for making matches,\r\n       and is now sometimes employed for setting fire to explosive\r\n       charges by means of an arrangement in which the acid is caused to\r\n       fall on the mixture at the moment required. An interesting\r\n       experiment on the combustion of phosphorus under water may be\r\n       conducted with chlorine dioxide. Pieces of phosphorus and of\r\n       potassium chlorate are placed under water, and sulphuric acid is\r\n       poured on to them (through a long funnel); the phosphorus then\r\n       burns at the expense of the chlorine dioxide.\r\n\r\n  [42] Potassium permanganate oxidises chlorine dioxide into chloric acid\r\n       (Fürst).\r\n\r\n  [43] The euchlorine obtained by Davy by gently heating potassium\r\n       chlorate with hydrochloric acid is (Pebal) a mixture of chlorine\r\n       dioxide and free chlorine. The liquid and gaseous chlorine oxide\r\n       (Note 35), which Millon considered to be Cl_{2}O_{3}, probably\r\n       contains a mixture of ClO_{2} (vapour density 35), Cl_{2}O_{3}\r\n       (whose vapour density should be 59), and chlorine (vapour density\r\n       35·5), since its vapour density was determined to be about 40.\r\n\r\nAs the salts of chloric acid, HClO_{3}, are produced by the splitting\r\nup of the salts of hypochlorous acid, so in the same way the salts\r\nof perchloric acid, HClO_{4}, are produced from the salts of chloric\r\nacid, HClO_{3}. But this is the highest form of the oxidation of HCl.\r\n_Perchloric acid_, HClO_{4}, is the most stable of all the acids of\r\nchlorine. When fused potassium chlorate begins to swell up and solidify,\r\nafter having parted with one-third of its oxygen, potassium chloride and\r\npotassium perchlorate have been formed according to the equation 2KClO_{3}\r\n= KClO_{4} + KCl + O_{2}.\r\n\r\nThe formation of this salt is easily observed in the preparation of\r\noxygen from potassium chlorate, owing to the fact that the potassium\r\nperchlorate fuses with greater difficulty than the chlorate, and\r\ntherefore appears in the molten salt as solid grains (_see_ Chapter III.\r\nNote 12). Under the action of certain acids--for instance, sulphuric and\r\nnitric--potassium chlorate also gives potassium perchlorate. This latter\r\nmay be easily purified, because it is but sparingly soluble in water,\r\nalthough all the other salts of perchloric acid are very soluble and even\r\ndeliquesce in the air. The perchlorates, although they contain more\r\noxygen than the chlorates, are decomposed with greater difficulty, and\r\neven when thrown on ignited charcoal give a much feebler deflagration\r\nthan the chlorates. Sulphuric acid (at a temperature not below 100°)\r\nevolves volatile and to a certain extent stable perchloric acid from\r\npotassium perchlorate. Neither sulphuric nor any other acid will further\r\ndecompose perchloric acid as it decomposes chloric acid. Of all the acids\r\nof chlorine, perchloric acid alone can be distilled.[44] The pure hydrate\r\nHClO_{4}[45] is a colourless and exceedingly caustic substance which\r\nfumes in the air and has a specific gravity 1·78 at 15° (sometimes, after\r\nbeing kept for some time, it decomposes with a violent explosion). It\r\nexplodes violently when brought into contact with charcoal, paper, wood,\r\nand other organic substances. If a small quantity of water be added to\r\nthis hydrate, and it be cooled, a crystallo-hydrate, ClHO_{4},H_{2}O,\r\nseparates out. This is much more stable, but the liquid hydrate\r\nHClO_{4},2H_{2}O is still more so. The acid dissolves in water in all\r\nproportions, and its solutions are distinguished for their stability.[46]\r\nWhen ignited both the acid and its salts are decomposed, with the\r\nevolution of oxygen.[47]\r\n\r\n  [44] If a solution of chloric acid, HClO_{3}, be first concentrated\r\n       over sulphuric acid under the receiver of an air-pump and\r\n       afterwards distilled, chlorine and oxygen are evolved and\r\n       perchloric acid is formed: 4HClO_{3} = 2HClO_{4} + Cl_{2} + 3O +\r\n       H_{2}O. Roscoe accordingly decomposed directly a solution of\r\n       potassium chlorate by hydrofluosilicic acid, decanted it from the\r\n       precipitate of potassium silicofluoride, K_{2}SiF_{6},\r\n       concentrated the solution of chloric acid, and then distilled it,\r\n       perchloric acid being then obtained (_see_ following footnote).\r\n       That chloric acid is capable of passing into perchloric acid is\r\n       also seen from the fact that potassium permanganate is\r\n       decolorised, although slowly, by the action of a solution of\r\n       chloric acid. On decomposing a solution of potassium chlorate by\r\n       the action of an electric current, potassium perchlorate is\r\n       obtained at the positive electrode (where the oxygen is evolved).\r\n       Perchloric acid is also formed by the action of an electric\r\n       current on solutions of chlorine and chlorine monoxide. Perchloric\r\n       acid was obtained by Count Stadion and afterwards by Serullas, and\r\n       was studied by Roscoe and others.\r\n\r\n  [45] Perchloric acid, which is obtained in a free state by the action\r\n       of sulphuric acid on its salts, may be separated from a solution\r\n       very easily by distillation, being volatile, although it is\r\n       partially decomposed by distillation. The solution obtained after\r\n       distillation may be concentrated by evaporation in open vessels.\r\n       In the distillation the solution reaches a temperature of 200°,\r\n       and then a very constant liquid hydrate of the composition\r\n       HClO_{4},2H_{2}O is obtained in the distillate. If this hydrate be\r\n       mixed with sulphuric acid, it begins to decompose at 100°, but\r\n       nevertheless a portion of the acid passes over into the receiver\r\n       without decomposing, forming a crystalline hydrate HClO_{4},H_{2}O\r\n       which melts at 50°. On carefully heating this hydrate it breaks up\r\n       into perchloric acid, which distills over below 100°, and into the\r\n       liquid hydrate HClO_{4},2H_{2}O. The acid HClO_{4} may also be\r\n       obtained by adding one-fourth part of strong sulphuric acid to\r\n       potassium chlorate, carefully distilling and subjecting the\r\n       crystals of the hydrate HClO_{4},H_{2}O obtained in the distillate\r\n       to a fresh distillation. Perchloric acid, HClO_{4}, itself does\r\n       not distil, and is decomposed on distillation until the more\r\n       stable hydrate HClO_{4}, H_{2}O is formed; this decomposes into\r\n       HClO_{4} and HClO_{4},2H_{2}O, which latter hydrate distils without\r\n       decomposition. This forms an excellent example of the influence of\r\n       water on stability, and of the property of chlorine of giving\r\n       compounds of the type ClX_{7}, of which all the above hydrates,\r\n       ClO_{3}(OH), ClO_{2}(OH)_{3}, and ClO(OH)_{5}, are members.\r\n       Probably further research will lead to the discovery of a hydrate\r\n       Cl(OH)_{7}.\r\n\r\n  [46] According to Roscoe the specific gravity of perchloric acid = 1·782\r\n       and of the hydrate HClO_{4},H_{2}O in a liquid state (50°) 1·811;\r\n       hence a considerable contraction takes place in the combination of\r\n       HClO_{4} with H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [47] The decomposition of salts analogous to potassium chlorate has been\r\n       more fully studied in recent years by Potilitzin and P. Frankland.\r\n       Professor Potilitzin, by decomposing, for example, lithium\r\n       chlorate LiClO_{3}, found (from the quantity of lithium chloride\r\n       and oxygen) that at first the decomposition of the fused salt\r\n       (368°) takes place according to the equation, 3LiClO_{3} = 2LiCl +\r\n       LiClO_{4} + 5O, and that towards the end the remaining salt is\r\n       decomposed thus: 5LiClO_{3} = 4LiCl + LiClO_{4} + 10O. The\r\n       phenomena observed by Potilitzin obliged him to admit that lithium\r\n       perchlorate is capable of decomposing simultaneously with lithium\r\n       chlorate, with the formation of the latter salt and oxygen; and\r\n       this was confirmed by direct experiment, which showed that lithium\r\n       chlorate is always formed in the decomposition of the perchlorate.\r\n       Potilitzin drew particular attention to the fact that the\r\n       decomposition of potassium chlorate and of salts analogous to it,\r\n       although exothermal (Chapter III., Note 12), not only does not\r\n       proceed spontaneously, but requires time and a rise of temperature\r\n       in order to attain completion, which again shows that chemical\r\n       equilibria are not determined by the heat effects of reactions\r\n       only.\r\n\r\n       P. Frankland and J. Dingwall (1887) showed that at 448° (in the\r\n       vapour of sulphur) a mixture of potassium chlorate and powdered\r\n       glass is decomposed almost in accordance with the equation\r\n       2KClO_{3} = KClO_{4} + KCl + O_{2}, whilst the salt by itself\r\n       evolves about half as much oxygen, in accordance with the\r\n       equation, 8KClO_{3} = 5KClO_{4} + 3KCl + 2O_{2}. The decomposition\r\n       of potassium perchlorate in admixture with manganese peroxide\r\n       proceeds to completion, KClO_{4} = KCl + 2O_{2}. But in\r\n       decomposing by itself the salt at first gives potassium chlorate,\r\n       approximately according to the equation 7KClO_{4} = 2KClO_{3} +\r\n       5KCl + 11O_{2}. Thus there is now no doubt that when potassium\r\n       chlorate is heated, the perchlorate is formed, and that this salt,\r\n       in decomposing with evolution of oxygen, again gives the former\r\n       salt.\r\n\r\n       In the decomposition of barium hypochlorite, 50 per cent. of the\r\n       whole amount passes into chlorate, in the decomposition of\r\n       strontium hypochlorite (Potilitzin, 1890) 12·5 per cent., and of\r\n       calcium hypochlorite about 2·5 per cent. Besides which Potilitzin\r\n       showed that the decomposition of the hypochlorites and also of the\r\n       chlorates is always accompanied by the formation of a certain\r\n       quantity of the oxides and by the evolution of chlorine, the\r\n       chlorine being displaced by the oxygen disengaged. Spring and\r\n       Prost (1889) represent the evolution of oxygen from KClO_{3} as\r\n       due to the salt first splitting up into base and anhydride, thus\r\n       (1) 2MClO_{3} = M_{2}O + Cl_{2}O_{5}; (2) Cl_{2}O_{5} = Cl_{2} +\r\n       O_{3}; and (3) M_{2}O + Cl = 2MCl + O.\r\n\r\n       I may further remark that the decomposition of potassium chlorate\r\n       as a reaction evolving heat easily lends itself for this very\r\n       reason to the contact action of manganese peroxide and other\r\n       similar admixtures; for such very feeble influences as those of\r\n       contact may become evident either in those cases (for instance,\r\n       detonating gas, hydrogen peroxide, &c.), when the reaction is\r\n       accompanied by the evolution of heat, or when (for instance, H_{2}\r\n       + I_{2}, &c.) little heat is absorbed or evolved. In these cases\r\n       it is evident that the existing equilibrium is not very stable,\r\n       and that a small alteration in the conditions at the surfaces of\r\n       contact may suffice to upset it. In order to conceive the _modus\r\n       operandi_ of contact phenomena, it is enough to imagine, for\r\n       instance, that at the surface of contact the movement of the atoms\r\n       in the molecules changes from a circular to an elliptical path.\r\n       Momentary and transitory compounds may he formed, but their\r\n       formation cannot affect the explanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nOn comparing chlorine as an element not only with nitrogen and carbon but\r\nwith all the other non-metallic elements (chlorine has so little analogy\r\nwith the metals that a comparison with them would be superfluous), we\r\nfind in it the following fundamental properties of _the halogens_ or\r\nsalt-producers. With metals chlorine gives salts (such as sodium\r\nchloride, &c.); with hydrogen a very energetic and monobasic acid HCl,\r\nand the same quantity of chlorine is able by metalepsis to replace the\r\nhydrogen; with oxygen it forms unstable oxides of an acid character.\r\nThese properties of chlorine are possessed by three other elements,\r\nbromine, iodine, and fluorine. They are members of one natural family.\r\nEach representative has its peculiarities, its individual properties and\r\npoints of distinction, in combination and in the free state--otherwise\r\nthey would not be independent elements; but the repetition in all of them\r\nof the same chief characteristics of the family enables one more quickly\r\nto grasp all their various properties and to classify the elements\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a guiding thread in forming comparisons between the\r\nelements, attention must however be turned not only to their points of\r\nresemblance but also to those of their properties and characters in\r\nwhich they differ most from each other. And the atomic weights of the\r\nelements must be considered as their most elementary property, since\r\nthis is a quantity which is most firmly established, and must be taken\r\naccount of in all the reactions of the element. The halogens have the\r\nfollowing atomic weights--\r\n\r\n                 F = 19,  Cl = 35·5,  Br = 80,  I = 127.\r\n\r\nAll the properties, physical and chemical, of the elements and their\r\ncorresponding compounds must evidently be in a certain dependence on\r\nthis fundamental point, if the grouping in one family be natural.[47 bis]\r\nAnd we find in reality that, for instance, the properties of bromine,\r\nwhose atomic weight is almost the mean between those of iodine and\r\nchlorine, occupy a mean position between those of these two elements. The\r\nsecond measurable property of the elements is their equivalence or their\r\ncapacity for forming _compounds of definite forms_. Thus carbon or\r\nnitrogen in this respect differs widely from the halogens. Although the\r\nform ClO_{2} corresponds with NO_{2} and CO_{2}, yet the last is the\r\nhighest oxide of carbon, whilst that of nitrogen is N_{2}O_{5}, and for\r\nchlorine, if there were an anhydride of perchloric acid, its composition\r\nwould be Cl_{2}O_{7}, which is quite different from that of carbon. In\r\nrespect to the forms of their compounds the halogens, like all elements\r\nof one family or group, are perfectly analogous to each other, as is seen\r\nfrom their hydrogen compounds:\r\n\r\n                            HF, HCl, HBr, HI.\r\n\r\n  [47 bis] See, for example the melting point of NaCl, NaBr, NaI in\r\n       Chapter II. Note 27. According to F. Freyer and V. Meyer (1892),\r\n       the following are the boiling points of some of the corresponding\r\n       compounds of chlorine and bromine:\r\n\r\n                      BCl_{5}    17°  BBr_{3}   90°\r\n                      SiCl_{3}   59°  SiBr_{4} 153°\r\n                      PCl_{3}    76°  PBr_{3}  175°\r\n                      SbCl_{3}  223°  SbBr_{3} 275°\r\n                      BiCl_{3}  447°  BiBr_{3} 453°\r\n                      SnCl_{4}  606°  SnBr_{4} 619°\r\n                      ZnCl_{2}  730°  ZnBr_{2} 650°\r\n\r\n       Thus for all the more volatile compounds the replacement of\r\n       chlorine by bromine raises the boiling point, but in the ease of\r\n       ZnX_{2} it lowers it (Chapter XV. Note 19).\r\n\r\nTheir oxygen compounds exhibit a similar analogy. Only fluorine does not\r\ngive any oxygen compounds. The iodine and bromine compounds corresponding\r\nwith HClO_{3} and HClO_{4} are HBrO_{3} and HBrO_{4}, HIO_{3} and\r\nHIO_{4}. On comparing the properties of these acids we can even predict\r\nthat fluorine will not form any oxygen compound. For iodine is easily\r\noxidised--for instance, by nitric acid--whilst chlorine is not directly\r\noxidised. The oxygen acids of iodine are comparatively more stable than\r\nthose of chlorine; and, generally speaking, the affinity of iodine for\r\noxygen is much greater than that of chlorine. Here also bromine occupies\r\nan intermediate position. In fluorine we may therefore expect a still\r\nsmaller affinity for oxygen than in chlorine--and up to now it has not\r\nbeen combined with oxygen. If any oxygen compounds of fluorine should be\r\nobtained, they will naturally be exceedingly unstable. The relation of\r\nthese elements to hydrogen is the reverse of the above. Fluorine has so\r\ngreat an affinity for hydrogen that it decomposes water at the ordinary\r\ntemperature; whilst iodine has so little affinity for hydrogen that\r\nhydriodic acid, HI, is formed with difficulty, is easily decomposed, and\r\nacts as a reducing agent in a number of cases.\r\n\r\nFrom the form of their compounds the halogens are _univalent elements_\r\nwith respect to hydrogen and septivalent with respect to oxygen, N being\r\ntrivalent to hydrogen (it gives NH_{3}) and quinqui-valent to oxygen (it\r\ngives N_{2}O_{5}), and C being quadrivalent to both H and O as it forms\r\nCH_{4} and CO_{2}. And as not only their oxygen compounds, but also their\r\nhydrogen compounds, have acid properties, the halogens are _elements_\r\nof an exclusively _acid character_. Such metals as sodium, potassium,\r\nbarium only give basic oxides. In the case of nitrogen, although it\r\nforms acid oxides, still in ammonia we find that capacity to give an\r\nalkali with hydrogen which indicates a less distinctly acid character\r\nthan in the halogens. In no other elements is the acid-giving property\r\nso strongly developed as in the halogens.\r\n\r\nIn describing certain peculiarities characterising the halogens, we\r\nshall at every step encounter a confirmation of the above-mentioned\r\ngeneral relations.\r\n\r\nAs _fluorine_ decomposes water with the evolution of oxygen, F_{2} +\r\nH_{2}O = 2HF + O, for a long time all efforts to obtain it in free state\r\nby means of methods similar to those for the preparation of chlorine\r\nproved fruitless.[48] Thus by the action of hydrofluoric acid on\r\nmanganese peroxide, or by decomposing a solution of hydrofluoric acid by\r\nan electric current, either oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and fluorine\r\nwere obtained instead of fluorine. Probably a certain quantity of\r\nfluorine[48 bis] was set free by the action of oxygen or an electric\r\ncurrent on incandescent and fused calcium fluoride, but at a high\r\ntemperature fluorine acts even on platinum, and therefore it was not\r\nobtained. When chlorine acted on silver fluoride, AgF, in a vessel of\r\nnatural fluor spar, CaF_{2}, fluorine was also liberated; but it was\r\nmixed with chlorine, and it was impossible to study the properties of\r\nthe resultant gas. Brauner (1881) also obtained fluorine by igniting\r\ncerium fluoride, 2CeF_{4} = 2CeF_{3} + F_{2}; but this, like all\r\npreceding efforts, only showed fluorine to be a gas which decomposes\r\nwater, and is capable of acting in a number of instances like chlorine,\r\nbut gave no possibility of testing its properties. It was evident that it\r\nwas necessary to avoid as far as possible the presence of water and a\r\nrise of temperature; this Moissan succeeded in doing in 1886. He\r\ndecomposed anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, liquefied at a temperature of\r\n-23° and contained in a U-shaped tube (to which a small quantity of\r\npotassium fluoride had been added to make it a better conductor), by the\r\naction of a powerful electric current (twenty Bunsen's elements in\r\nseries). Hydrogen was then evolved at the negative pole, and fluorine\r\nappeared at the positive pole (of iridium platinum) as a pale green gas\r\nwhich decomposed water with the formation of ozone and hydrofluoric acid,\r\nand combined directly with silicon (forming silicon fluoride, SiF_{4}),\r\nboron (forming BF_{3}), sulphur, &c. Its density (H = 1) is 18, so that\r\nits molecule is F_{2}. But the action of fluorine on metals at the\r\nordinary temperature is comparatively feeble, because the metallic\r\nfluoride formed coats the remaining mass of the metals; it is, however,\r\ncompletely absorbed by iron. Hydrocarbons (such as naphtha), alcohol,\r\n&c., immediately absorb fluorine, with the formation of hydrofluoric\r\nacid. Fluorine when mixed with hydrogen can easily be made to explode\r\nviolently, forming hydrofluoric acid.[49]\r\n\r\n  [48] Even before free fluorine was obtained (1886) it was evident from\r\n       experience gained in the efforts made to obtain it, and from\r\n       analogy, that it would decompose water (_see_ first Russian\r\n       edition of the _Principles of Chemistry_).\r\n\r\n  [48 bis] It is most likely that in this experiment of Fremy's, which\r\n       corresponds with the action of oxygen on calcium chloride,\r\n       fluorine was set free, but that a converse reaction also\r\n       proceeded, CaO + F_{2} = CaF_{2} + O--that is, the calcium\r\n       distributed itself between the oxygen and fluorine. MnF_{4}, which\r\n       is capable of splitting up into MnF_{2} and F_{2}, is without\r\n       doubt formed by the action of a strong solution of hydrofluoric\r\n       acid on manganese peroxide, but under the action of water the\r\n       fluorine gives hydrofluoric acid, and probably this is aided by\r\n       the affinity of the manganese fluoride and hydrofluoric acid. In\r\n       all the attempts made (by Davy, Knox, Louget, Fremy, Gore, and\r\n       others) to decompose fluorides (those of lead, silver, calcium,\r\n       and others) by chlorine, there were doubtless also cases of\r\n       distribution, a portion of the metal combined with chlorine and a\r\n       portion of the fluorine was evolved; but it is improbable that any\r\n       decisive results were obtained. Fremy probably obtained fluorine,\r\n       but not in a pure state.\r\n\r\n  [49] According to Moissan, fluorine is disengaged by the action of an\r\n       electric current on fused hydrogen potassium fluoride, KHF_{2}.\r\n       The present state of chemical knowledge is such that the knowledge\r\n       of the properties of an element is much more general than the\r\n       knowledge of the free element itself. It is useful and\r\n       satisfactory to learn that even fluorine in the free state has not\r\n       succeeded in eluding experiment and research, that the efforts to\r\n       isolate it have been crowned with success, but the sum total of\r\n       chemical data concerning fluorine as an element gains but little\r\n       by this achievement. The gain will, however, be augmented if it be\r\n       now possible to subject fluorine to a comparative study in\r\n       relation to oxygen and chlorine. There is particular interest in\r\n       the phenomena of the distribution of fluorine and oxygen, or\r\n       fluorine and chlorine, competing under different conditions and\r\n       relations. We may add that Moissan (1892) found that free fluorine\r\n       decomposes H_{2}S, HCl, HBr, CS_{2}, and CNH with a flash; it does\r\n       not act upon O_{2}, N_{2}, CO, and CO_{2}; Mg, Al, Ag, and Ni,\r\n       when heated, burn in it, as also do S, Se, P (forms PF_{5}); it\r\n       reacts upon H_{2} even in the dark, with the evolution of 366·00\r\n       units of heat. At a temperature of -95°, F_{2} still retains its\r\n       gaseous state. Soot and carbon in general (but not the diamond)\r\n       when heated in gaseous fluorine form _fluoride of carbon_, CF_{4}\r\n       (Moissan, 1890); this compound is also formed at 300° by the\r\n       double decomposition of CCl_{4} and AgF; it is a gas which\r\n       liquefies at 10° under a pressure of 5 atmospheres. With an\r\n       alcoholic solution of KHO, CF_{4} gives K_{2}CO_{3}, according to\r\n       the equation CF_{4} + 6KHO = K_{2}CO_{3} + 4KF + 3H_{2}O. CF_{4}\r\n       is not soluble in water, but it is easily soluble in CCl_{4} and\r\n       alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Brauner obtained fluorine directly by igniting the easily\r\nformed[49 bis] double lead salt HF,3KF,PbF_{4}, which first, at 230°,\r\ndecomposes with the evolution of HF, and then splits up forming\r\n3KF,PbF_{2} and fluorine F_{2}, which is recognised by the fact that it\r\nliberates iodine from KI and easily combines with silicon, forming\r\nSiF_{4}. This method gives chemically pure fluorine, and is based upon\r\nthe breaking up of the higher compound--tetrafluoride of lead, PbF_{4},\r\ncorresponding to PbO_{2}, into free fluorine, F_{2}, and the lower more\r\nstable form--bifluoride of lead, PbF_{2}, which corresponds to PbO; that\r\nis, this method resembles the ordinary method of obtaining chlorine by\r\nmeans of MnO_{2}, as MnCl_{4} here breaks up into MnCl_{2} and chlorine,\r\njust as PbF_{4} splits up into PbF_{2} and fluorine.\r\n\r\n  [49 bis] T. Nikolukin (1885) and subsequently Friedrich and Classen\r\n       obtained PbCl_{4} and a double ammonium salt of tetrachloride of\r\n       lead (starting from the binoxide), PbCl_{4}2NH_{4}Cl; Hutchinson\r\n       and Pallard obtained a similar salt of acetic acid (1893)\r\n       corresponding to PbX_{4} by treating red lead with strong acetic\r\n       acid; the composition of this salt is Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{4}; it\r\n       melts (and decomposes) at about 175°. Brauner (1894) obtained a\r\n       salt corresponding to tetrafluoride of lead, PbF_{4}, and the acid\r\n       corresponding to it, H_{4}PbF_{8}. For example, by treating\r\n       potassium plumbate (Chapter XVIII. Note 55) with strong HF, and\r\n       also the above-mentioned tetra-acetate with a solution of KHF_{2},\r\n       Brauner obtained crystalline HK_{3}PbF_{8}--i.e. the salt from\r\n       which he obtained fluorine.\r\n\r\nAmong the compounds of fluorine, calcium fluoride, CaF_{2}, is somewhat\r\nwidely distributed in nature as fluor spar,[50] whilst _cryolite_, or\r\naluminium sodium fluoride, Na_{3}AlF_{6}, is found more rarely (in large\r\nmasses in Greenland). Cryolite, like fluor spar, is also insoluble in\r\nwater, and gives hydrofluoric acid with sulphuric acid. Small quantities\r\nof fluorine have also in a number of cases been found in the bodies of\r\nanimals, in the blood, urine, and bones. If fluorides occur in the bodies\r\nof animals, they must have been introduced in food, and must occur in\r\nplants and in water. And as a matter of fact river, and especially sea,\r\nwater always contains a certain, although small, quantity of fluorine\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n  [50] It is called spar because it very frequently occurs as crystals of\r\n       a clearly laminar structure, and is therefore easily split up into\r\n       pieces bounded by planes. It is called fluor spar because when\r\n       used as a flux it renders ores fusible, owing to its reacting with\r\n       silica, SiO_{2} + 2CaF_{2} = 2CaO + SiF_{4}; the silicon fluoride\r\n       escapes as a gas and the lime combines with a further quantity of\r\n       silica, and gives a vitreous slag. Fluor spar occurs in mineral\r\n       veins and rocks, sometimes in considerable quantities. It always\r\n       crystallises in the cubic system, sometimes in very large\r\n       semi-transparent cubic crystals, which are colourless or of\r\n       different colours. It is insoluble in water. It melts under the\r\n       action of heat, and crystallises on cooling. The specific gravity\r\n       is 3·1. When steam is passed over incandescent fluor spar, lime\r\n       and hydrofluoric acid are formed: CaF_{2} + H_{2}O = CaO + 2HF. A\r\n       double decomposition is also easily produced by fusing fluor spar\r\n       with sodium or potassium hydroxides, or potash, or even with their\r\n       carbonates; the fluorine then passes over to the potassium or\r\n       sodium, and the oxygen to the calcium. In solutions--for example,\r\n       Ca(NO_{3})_{2} + 2KF = CaF_{2} (precipitate) + 2KNO_{3} (in\r\n       solution)--the formation of calcium fluoride takes place, owing to\r\n       its very sparing solubility. 26,000 parts of water dissolve one\r\n       part of fluor spar.\r\n\r\nHydrifluoric acid, HF, cannot be obtained from fluor spar in glass\r\nretorts, because glass is acted on by and destroys the acid. It is\r\nprepared in lead vessels, and when it is required pure, in platinum\r\nvessels, because lead also acts on hydrofluoric acid, although only very\r\nfeebly on the surface, and when once a coating of fluoride and sulphate\r\nof lead is formed no further action takes place. Powdered fluor spar and\r\nsulphuric acid evolve hydrofluoric acid (which fumes in the air) even at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, CaF_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = CaSO_{4} + 2HF. At 130°\r\nfluor spar is completely decomposed by sulphuric acid. The acid is then\r\nevolved as vapour, which may be condensed by a freezing mixture into an\r\nanhydrous acid. The condensation is aided by pouring water into the\r\nreceiver of the condenser, as the acid is easily soluble in cold water.\r\n\r\nIn the liquid anhydrous form hydrofluoric acid boils at +19°, and its\r\nspecific gravity at 12·8° = 0·9849.[51] It dissolves in water with the\r\nevolution of a considerable amount of heat, and gives a solution of\r\nconstant boiling point which distils over at 120°; showing that the acid\r\nis able to combine with water. The specific gravity of the compound is\r\n1·15, and its composition HF,2H_{2}O.[52] With an excess of water a\r\ndilute solution distils over first. The aqueous solution and the acid\r\nitself must be kept in platinum vessels, but the dilute acid may be\r\nconveniently preserved in vessels made of various organic materials,\r\nsuch as gutta-percha, or even in glass vessels having an interior\r\ncoating of paraffin. Hydrofluoric acid does not act on hydrocarbons\r\nand many other substances, but it acts in a highly corrosive manner\r\non metals, glass, porcelain, and the majority of rock substances.[53]\r\nIt also attacks the skin, and is distinguished by its poisonous\r\nproperties, so that in working with the acid a strong draught must be\r\nkept up, to prevent the possibility of the fumes being inhaled. The\r\nnon-metals do not act on hydrofluoric acid, but all metals--with the\r\nexception of mercury, silver, gold, and platinum, and, to a certain\r\ndegree, lead--decompose it with the evolution of hydrogen. With bases\r\nit gives directly metallic fluorides, and behaves in many respects like\r\nhydrochloric acid. There are, however, several distinct individual\r\ndifferences, which are furthermore much greater than those between\r\nhydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic acids. Thus the silver\r\ncompounds of the latter are insoluble in water, whilst silver fluoride\r\nis soluble. Calcium fluoride, on the contrary, is insoluble in water,\r\nwhilst calcium chloride, bromide, and iodide are not only soluble, but\r\nattract water with great energy. Neither hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nor\r\nhydriodic acid acts on sand and glass, whilst hydrofluoric acid corrodes\r\nthem, forming gaseous silicon fluoride. The other halogen acids only form\r\nnormal salts, KCl, NaCl, with Na or K, whilst hydrofluoric acid gives\r\nacid salts, for instance HKF_{2} (and by dissolving KF in liquid HF,\r\nKHF_{2}2HF is obtained). This latter property is in close connection with\r\nthe fact that at the ordinary temperature the vapour density of\r\nhydrofluoric acid is nearly 20, which corresponds with a formula\r\nH_{2}F_{2}, as Mallet (1881) showed; but a depolymerisation occurs with a\r\nrise of temperature, and the density approaches 10, which answers to the\r\nformula HF.[54]\r\n\r\n  [51] According to Gore. Fremy obtained anhydrous hydrofluoric acid by\r\n       decomposing lead fluoride at a red heat, by hydrogen, or by\r\n       beating the double salt HKF_{2}, which easily crystallises (in\r\n       cubes) from a solution of hydrofluoric acid, half of which has\r\n       been saturated with potassium hydroxide. Its vapour density\r\n       corresponds to the formula HF.\r\n\r\n  [52] This composition corresponds to the crystallo-hydrate HCl,2H_{2}O.\r\n       All the properties of hydrofluoric acid recall those of\r\n       hydrochloric acid, and therefore the comparative ease with which\r\n       hydrofluoric acid is liquefied (it boils at +19°, hydrochloric\r\n       acid at -35°) must be explained by a polymerisation taking place at\r\n       low temperatures, as will be afterwards explained, H_{2}F_{2} being\r\n       formed, and therefore in a liquid state it differs from\r\n       hydrochloric acid, in which a phenomenon of a similar kind has not\r\n       yet been observed.\r\n\r\n  [53] The corrosive action of hydrofluoric acid on glass and similar\r\n       siliceous compounds is based upon the fact that it acts on silica,\r\n       SiO_{2}, as we shall consider more fully in describing that\r\n       compound, forming gaseous silicon fluoride, SiO_{2} + 4HF =\r\n       SiF_{4} + 2H_{2}O. Silica, on the other hand, forms the binding\r\n       (acid) element of glass and of the mass of mineral substances\r\n       forming the salts of silica. When it is removed the cohesion is\r\n       destroyed. This is made use of in the arts, and in the laboratory,\r\n       for etching designs and scales, &c., on glass. In _engraving on\r\n       glass_ the surface is covered with a varnish composed of four\r\n       parts of wax and one part of turpentine. This varnish is not acted\r\n       on by hydrofluoric acid, and it is soft enough to allow of designs\r\n       being drawn upon it whose lines lay bare the glass. The drawing is\r\n       made with a steel point, and the glass is afterwards laid in a\r\n       lead trough in which a mixture of fluor spar and sulphuric acid is\r\n       placed. The sulphuric acid must be used in considerable excess, as\r\n       otherwise transparent lines are obtained (owing to the formation\r\n       of hydrofluosilicic acid). After being exposed for some time, the\r\n       varnish is removed (melted) and the design drawn by the steel\r\n       point is found reproduced in dull lines. The drawing may be also\r\n       made by the direct application of a mixture of a silicofluoride\r\n       and sulphuric acid, which forms hydrofluoric acid.\r\n\r\n  [54] Mallet (1881) determined the density at 30° and 100°, previous to\r\n       which Gore (1869) had determined the vapour density at 100°,\r\n       whilst Thorpe and Hambly (1888) made fourteen determinations\r\n       between 26° and 88°, and showed that within this limit of\r\n       temperature the density gradually diminishes, just like the vapour\r\n       of acetic acid, nitrogen dioxide, and others. The tendency of HF\r\n       to polymerise into H_{2}F_{2} is probably connected with the\r\n       property of many fluorides of forming acid salts--for example,\r\n       KHF_{2} and H_{2}SiF_{6}. We saw above that HCl has the same\r\n       property (forming, for instance, H_{2}PtCl_{6}, &c., p. 457), and\r\n       hence this property of hydrofluoric acid does not stand isolated\r\n       from the properties of the other halogens.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between chlorine and the other two halogens, bromine and\r\niodine, is much more perfect. Not only have their hydrates or halogen\r\nacids much in common, but they themselves resemble chlorine in many\r\nrespects,[55] and even the properties of the corresponding metallic\r\ncompounds of bromine and iodine are very much alike. Thus, the chlorides,\r\nbromides, and iodides of sodium and potassium crystallise in the cubic\r\nsystem, and are soluble in water; the chlorides of calcium, aluminium,\r\nmagnesium, and barium are just as soluble in water as the bromides and\r\niodides of these metals. The iodides and bromides of silver and lead are\r\nsparingly soluble in water, like the chlorides of these metals. The\r\noxygen compounds of bromine and iodine also present a very strong analogy\r\nto the corresponding compounds of chlorine. A hypobromous acid is known\r\ncorresponding with hypochlorous acid. The salts of this acid have the\r\nsame bleaching property as the salts of hypochlorous acid. Iodine was\r\ndiscovered in 1811 by Courtois in kelp, and was shortly afterwards\r\ninvestigated by Clement, Gay-Lussac, and Davy. Bromine was discovered in\r\n1826 by Balard in the mother liquor of sea water.\r\n\r\n  [55] For instance, the experiment with Dutch metal foil (Note 16) may\r\n       be made with bromine just as well as with chlorine. A very\r\n       instructive experiment on the direct combination of the halogens\r\n       with metals maybe made by throwing a small piece (a shaving) of\r\n       aluminium into a vessel containing liquid bromine; the aluminium,\r\n       being lighter, floats on the bromine, and after a certain time\r\n       reaction sets in accompanied by the evolution of heat, light, and\r\n       fumes of bromine. The incandescent piece of metal moves rapidly\r\n       over the surface of the bromine in which the resultant aluminium\r\n       bromide dissolves. For the sake of comparison we will proceed to\r\n       cite several thermochemical data (Thomsen) for analogous actions\r\n       of (1) chlorine, (2) bromine, and (3) iodine, with respect to\r\n       metals; the halogen being expressed by the symbol X, and the plus\r\n       sign connecting the reacting substances. All the figures are given\r\n       in thousands of calories, and refer to molecular quantities in\r\n       grams and to the ordinary temperature:--\r\n\r\n                                          1     2     3\r\n                        K_{2}  + X_{2}   211   191   160\r\n                        Na_{2} + X_{2}   195   172   138\r\n                        Ag_{2} + X_{2}    59    45    28\r\n                        Hg_{2} + X_{2}    83    68    48\r\n                        Hg     + X_{2}    63    51    34\r\n                        Ca     + X_{2}   170   141    --\r\n                        Ba     + X_{2}   195   170    --\r\n                        Zn     + X_{2}    97    76    49\r\n                        Pb     + X_{2}    83    64    40\r\n                        Al     + X_{2}   161   120    70\r\n\r\n       We may remark that the latent heat of vaporisation of the\r\n       molecular weight Br_{2} is about 7·2, and of iodine 6·0 thousand\r\n       heat units, whilst the latent heat of fusion of Br_{2} is about\r\n       0·3, and of I_{2} about 3·0 thousand heat units. From this it is\r\n       evident that the difference between the amounts of heat evolved\r\n       does not depend on the difference in physical state. For instance,\r\n       the vapour of iodine in combining with Zn to form ZnI_{2} would\r\n       give 48 + 8 + 3, or about sixty thousand heat units, or 1-1/2\r\n       times less than Zn + Cl_{2}.\r\n\r\n_Bromine_ and iodine, like chlorine, occur in sea water in combination\r\nwith metals. However, the amount of bromides, and especially of iodides,\r\nin sea water is so small that their presence can only be discovered by\r\nmeans of sensitive reactions.[56] In the extraction of salt from sea\r\nwater the bromides remain in the mother liquor. Iodine and bromine also\r\noccur combined with silver, in admixture with silver chloride, as a rare\r\nore which is mainly found in America. Certain mineral waters (those of\r\nKreuznach and Staro-rossüsk) contain metallic bromides and iodides,\r\nalways in admixture with an excess of sodium chloride. Those upper strata\r\nof the Stassfurt rock salt (Chapter X.) which are a source of potassium\r\nsalts also contain metallic bromides,[57] which collect in the mother\r\nliquors left after the crystallisation of the potassium salts; and this\r\nnow forms the chief source (together with certain American springs) of\r\nthe bromine in common use. Bromine may be easily liberated from a mixture\r\nof bromides and chlorides, owing to the fact that chlorine displaces\r\nbromine from its compounds with sodium, magnesium, calcium, &c. A\r\ncolourless solution of bromides and chlorides turns an orange colour\r\nafter the passage of chlorine, owing to the disengagement of bromine.[58]\r\nBromine may be extracted on a large scale by a similar method, but it is\r\nsimpler to add a small quantity of manganese peroxide and sulphuric acid\r\nto the mother liquid direct. This sets free a portion of the chlorine,\r\nand this chlorine liberates the bromine.\r\n\r\n  [56] One litre of sea-water contains about 20 grams of chlorine, and\r\n       about 0·07 gram of bromine. The Dead Sea contains about ten times\r\n       as much bromine.\r\n\r\n  [57] But there is no iodine in Stassfurt carnallite.\r\n\r\n  [58] The chlorine must not, however, be in large excess, as otherwise\r\n       the bromine would contain chlorine. Commercial bromine not\r\n       unfrequently contains chlorine, as bromine chloride; this is more\r\n       soluble in water than bromine, from which it may thus be freed. To\r\n       obtain pure bromine the commercial bromine is washed with water,\r\n       dried by sulphuric acid, and distilled, the portion coming over at\r\n       58° being collected; the greater part is then converted into\r\n       potassium bromide and dissolved, and the remainder is added to the\r\n       solution in order to separate iodine, which is removed by shaking\r\n       with carbon bisulphide. By heating the potassium bromide thus\r\n       obtained with manganese peroxide and sulphuric acid, bromine is\r\n       obtained quite free from iodine, which, however, is not present in\r\n       certain kinds of commercial bromine (the Stassfurt, for instance).\r\n       By treatment with potash, the bromine is then converted into a\r\n       mixture of potassium bromide and bromate, and the mixture (which\r\n       is in the proportion given in the equation) is distilled with\r\n       sulphuric acid, bromine being then evolved: 5KBr + KBrO_{3} +\r\n       6H_{2}SO_{4} = 6KHSO_{4} + 3H_{2}O + 3Br_{2}. After dissolving the\r\n       bromine in a strong solution of calcium bromide and precipitating\r\n       with an excess of water, it loses all the chlorine it contained,\r\n       because chlorine forms calcium chloride with CaBr_{2}.\r\n\r\nBromine is a _dark brown liquid_, giving brown fumes, and having a\r\npoisonous suffocating smell, whence its name (from the Greek [Greek:\r\nbrômos], signifying evil smelling). The vapour density of bromine shows\r\nthat its molecule is Br_{2}. In the cold bromine freezes into brown-grey\r\nscales like iodine. The melting point of pure bromine is -7°·05.[59] The\r\ndensity of liquid bromide at 0° is 3·187, and at 15° about 3·0. The\r\nboiling point of bromine is about 58°·7. Bromine, like chlorine, is\r\nsoluble in water; 1 part of bromine at 5° requires 27 parts of water, and\r\nat 15° 29 parts of water. The aqueous solution of bromine is of an\r\norange colour, and when cooled to -2° yields crystals containing 10\r\nmolecules of water to 1 molecule of bromine.[60] Alcohol dissolves a\r\ngreater quantity of bromine, and ether a still greater amount. But after\r\na certain time products of the action of the bromine on these organic\r\nsubstances are formed in the solutions. Aqueous solutions of the bromides\r\nalso absorb a large amount of bromine.\r\n\r\n  [59] There has long existed a difference of opinion as to the melting\r\n       point of pure bromine. By some investigators (Regnault, Pierre) it\r\n       was given as between -7° and -8°, and by others (Balard, Liebig,\r\n       Quincke, Baumhauer) as between -20° and -25°. There is now no doubt,\r\n       thanks more especially to the researches of Ramsay and Young\r\n       (1885), that pure bromine melts at about -7°. This figure is not\r\n       only established by direct experiment (Van der Plaats confirmed\r\n       it), but also by means of the determination of the vapour\r\n       tensions. For solid bromine the vapour tension _p_ in mm. at _t_\r\n       was found to be--\r\n\r\n                  _p_ =  20     25   30   35  40    45 mm.\r\n                  _t_ = -16°·6 -14° -12° -10° -8·5° -7°\r\n\r\n       For liquid bromine--\r\n\r\n             _p_ =   50    100    200    400    600   760 mm.\r\n             _t_ = -5°·0   8°·2  23°·4  40°·4  51°·9  58°·7\r\n\r\n       These curves intersect at -7°·05. Besides which, in comparing the\r\n       vapour tension of many liquids (for example, those given in\r\n       Chapter II., Note 27), Ramsay and Young observed that the ratio of\r\n       the absolute temperatures (_t_ + 273) corresponding with equal\r\n       tension _varies_ for every pair of substances in rectilinear\r\n       proportion in dependence upon _t_, and, therefore, for the above\r\n       pressure _p_, Ramsay and Young determined the ratio of _t_ + 273\r\n       for water and bromine, and found that the straight lines\r\n       expressing these ratios for liquid and solid bromine intersect\r\n       also at 7°·05; thus, for example, for solid bromine--\r\n\r\n             _p_  =   20       25       30       35       40      45\r\n       273 + _t_  =  256·4    259      261      263      264·6    266\r\n       273 + _t_´ =  295·3    299      302·1    304·8    307·2    309·3\r\n             _c_  =    1·152    1·154    1·157    1·159    1·161    1·163\r\n\r\n       where _t_´ indicates the temperature of water corresponding with a\r\n       vapour tension _p_, and where _c_ is the ratio of 273 + _t_´ to\r\n       273 + _t_. The magnitude of _c_ is evidently expressed with great\r\n       accuracy by the straight line _c_ = 1·1703 + 0·0011_t_. In exactly\r\n       the same way we find the ratio for liquid bromine and water to be\r\n       _c__{1} = 1·1585 + 0·00057t. The intersection of these straight\r\n       lines in fact corresponds with -7°·06, which again confirms the\r\n       melting point given above for bromine. In this manner it is\r\n       possible with the existing store of data to accurately establish\r\n       and _verify_ the melting point of substances. Ramsay and Young\r\n       established the thermal constants of iodine by exactly the same\r\n       method.\r\n\r\n  [60] The observations made by Paterno and Nasini (by Raoult's method,\r\n       Chapter I. Note 49) on the temperature of the formation of ice\r\n       (-1°·115, with 1·391 gram of bromine in 100 grams of water) in an\r\n       aqueous solution of bromine, showed that bromine is contained in\r\n       solutions as the molecule Br_{2}. Similar experiments conducted on\r\n       iodine (Kloboukoff 1889 and Beckmann 1890) show that in solution\r\n       the molecule is I_{2}.\r\n\r\n       B. Roozeboom investigated the hydrate of bromine as completely as\r\n       the hydrate of chlorine (Notes 9, 10). The temperature of the\r\n       complete decomposition of the hydrate is +6°·2; the density of\r\n       Br_{2},10H_{2}O = 1·49.\r\n\r\nWith respect to _iodine_, it is almost exclusively extracted from the\r\nmother liquors after the crystallisation of natural sodium nitrate (Chili\r\nsaltpetre) and from the ashes of the sea-weed cast upon the shores of\r\nFrance, Great Britain, and Spain, sometimes in considerable quantities,\r\nby the high tides. The majority of these sea-weeds are of the genera\r\n_Fucus_, _Laminaria_, &c. The fused ashes of these sea-weeds are called\r\n'kelp' in Scotland and 'varech' in Normandy. A somewhat considerable\r\nquantity of iodine is contained in these sea-weeds. After being burnt\r\n(or subjected to dry distillation) an ash is left which chiefly contains\r\nsalts of potassium, sodium, and calcium. The metals occur in the sea-weed\r\nas salts of organic acids. On being burnt these organic salts are\r\ndecomposed, forming carbonates of potassium and sodium. Hence, sodium\r\ncarbonate is found in the ash of sea plants. The ash is dissolved in hot\r\nwater, and on evaporation sodium carbonate and other salts separate, but\r\na portion of the substances remains in solution. These mother liquors\r\nleft after the separation of the sodium carbonate contain chlorine,\r\nbromine, and iodine in combination with metals, the chlorine and iodine\r\nbeing in excess of the bromine. 13,000 kilos of kelp give about 1,000\r\nkilos of sodium carbonate and 15 kilos of iodine.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of the iodine from the mother liquor is effected with\r\ncomparative ease, because chlorine disengages iodine from potassium\r\niodide and its other combinations with the metals. Not only chlorine,\r\nbut also sulphuric acid, liberates iodine from sodium iodide. Sulphuric\r\nacid, in acting on an iodide, sets hydriodic acid free, but the latter\r\neasily decomposes, especially in the presence of substances capable\r\nof evolving oxygen, such as chromic acid, nitrous acid, and even\r\nferric salts.[61] Owing to its sparing solubility in water, the iodine\r\nliberated separates as a precipitate. To obtain pure iodine it is\r\nsufficient to distil it, and neglect the first and last portions of\r\nthe distillate, the middle portion only being collected. Iodine passes\r\ndirectly from a state of vapour into a crystalline form, and settles on\r\nthe cool portions of the apparatus in tabular crystals, having a black\r\ngrey colour and metallic lustre.[62]\r\n\r\n  [61] In general, 2HI + O = I_{2} + H_{2}O, if the oxygen proceed from a\r\n       substance from which it is easily evolved. For this reason\r\n       compounds corresponding with the higher stages of oxidation or\r\n       chlorination frequently give a lower stage when treated with\r\n       hydriodic acid. Ferric oxide, Fe_{2}O_{3}, is a higher oxide, and\r\n       ferrous oxide, FeO, a lower oxide; the former corresponds with\r\n       FeX_{3}, and the latter with FeX_{2}, and this passage from the\r\n       higher to the lower takes place under the action of hydriodic\r\n       acid. Thus hydrogen peroxide and ozone (Chapter IV.) are able to\r\n       liberate iodine from hydriodic acid. Compounds of copper oxide,\r\n       CuO or CuX_{2}, give compounds of the suboxide Cu_{2}O, or CuX.\r\n       Even sulphuric acid, which corresponds to the higher stage SO_{3},\r\n       is able to act thus, forming the lower oxide SO_{2}. The\r\n       liberation of iodine from hydriodic acid proceeds with still\r\n       greater ease under the action of substances capable of disengaging\r\n       oxygen. In practice, many methods are employed for liberating\r\n       iodine from acid liquids containing, for example, sulphuric acid\r\n       and hydriodic acid. The higher oxides of nitrogen are most\r\n       commonly used; they then pass into nitric oxide. Iodine may even\r\n       be disengaged from hydriodic acid by the action of iodic acid, &c.\r\n       But there is a limit in these reactions of the oxidation of\r\n       hydriodic acid because, under certain conditions, especially in\r\n       dilute solutions, the iodine set free is itself able to act as an\r\n       oxidising agent--that is, it exhibits the character of chlorine,\r\n       and of the halogens in general, to which we shall again have\r\n       occasion to refer. In Chili, where a large quantity of iodine is\r\n       extracted in the manufacture of Chili nitre, which contains\r\n       NaIO_{3}, it is mixed with the acid and normal sulphites of sodium\r\n       in solution; the iodine is then precipitated according to the\r\n       equation 2NaIO_{3} + 3Na_{2}SO_{3} + 2NaHSO_{3} = 5Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n       +I_{2} + H_{2}O. The iodine thus obtained is purified by\r\n       sublimation.\r\n\r\n  [62] For the final purification of iodine, Stas dissolved it in a\r\n       strong solution of potassium iodide, and precipitated it by the\r\n       addition of water (_see_ Note 58).\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the crystals of iodine is 4·95. It melts at 114°\r\nand boils at 184°. Its vapour is formed at a much lower temperature, and\r\nis of a violet colour, whence iodine receives its name ([Greek: ioeidês],\r\nviolet). The smell of iodine recalls the characteristic smell of\r\nhypochlorous acid; it has a sharp sour taste. It destroys the skin and\r\norgans of the body, and is therefore frequently employed for cauterising\r\nand as an irritant for the skin. In small quantities it turns the skin\r\nbrown, but the coloration disappears after a certain time, partly owing\r\nto the volatility of the iodine. Water dissolves only 1/5000 part of\r\niodine. A brown solution is thus obtained, which bleaches, but much more\r\nfeebly than bromine and chlorine. Water which contains salts, and\r\nespecially iodides, in solution dissolves iodine in considerable\r\nquantities, and the resultant solution is of a dark brown colour. Pure\r\nalcohol dissolves a small amount of iodine, and in so doing acquires a\r\nbrown colour, but the solubility of iodine is considerably increased by\r\nthe presence of a small quantity of an iodine compound--for instance,\r\nethyl iodide--in the alcohol.[63] Ether dissolves a larger amount of\r\niodine than alcohol; but iodine is particularly soluble in liquid\r\nhydrocarbons, in carbon bisulphide, and in chloroform. A small quantity\r\nof iodine dissolved in carbon bisulphide tints it rose-colour, but in a\r\nsomewhat larger amount it gives a violet colour. Chloroform (quite free\r\nfrom alcohol) is also tinted rose colour by a small amount of iodine.\r\nThis gives an easy means for detecting the presence of free iodine in\r\nsmall quantities. The blue coloration which free iodine gives with\r\n_starch_ may also, as has already been frequently mentioned (_see_\r\nChapter IV.), serve for the detection of iodine.\r\n\r\n  [63] The solubility of iodine in solutions containing iodides, and\r\n       compounds of iodine in general, may serve, on the one hand, as an\r\n       indication that solution is due to a similarity between the\r\n       solvent and dissolved substance, and, on the other hand, as an\r\n       indirect proof of that view as to solutions which was cited in\r\n       Chapter I., because in many instances unstable highly iodised\r\n       compounds, resembling crystallo-hydrates, have been obtained from\r\n       such solutions. Thus iodide of tetramethylammonium,\r\n       N(CH_{3})_{4}I, combines with I_{2}, and I_{4}. Even a solution of\r\n       iodine in a saturated solution of potassium iodide presents\r\n       indications of the formation of a definite compound KI_{3}. Thus,\r\n       an alcoholic solution of KI_{3} does not give up iodine to carbon\r\n       bisulphide, although this solvent takes up iodine from an\r\n       alcoholic solution of iodine itself (Girault, Jörgensen, and\r\n       others). The instability of these compounds resembles the\r\n       instability of many crystallo-hydrates, for instance of\r\n       HCl,2H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the four elements, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine,\r\nwe see in them an example of analogous substances which arrange\r\nthemselves by their physical properties in the same order as they stand\r\nin respect to their atomic and molecular weights. If the weight of the\r\nmolecule be large, the substance has a higher specific gravity, a higher\r\nmelting and boiling point, and a whole series of properties depending on\r\nthis difference in its fundamental properties. Chlorine in a free state\r\nboils at about -35°, bromine boils at 60°, and iodine only above 180°.\r\nAccording to Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, the vapour densities of these\r\nelements in a gaseous state are proportional to their atomic weights, and\r\nhere, at all events approximately, the densities in a liquid (or solid)\r\nstate are also almost in the ratio of their atomic weights. Dividing the\r\natomic weight of chlorine (35·5) by its specific gravity in a liquid\r\nstate (1·3), we obtain a volume = 27, for bromine (80/3·1) 26, and for\r\niodine also (127/4·9) 26.[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] The equality of the atomic volumes of the halogens themselves is\r\n       all the more remarkable because in all the halogen compounds the\r\n       volume augments with the substitution of fluorine by chlorine,\r\n       bromine, and iodine. Thus, for example, the volume of sodium\r\n       fluoride (obtained by dividing the weight expressed by its formula\r\n       by its specific gravity) is about 15, of sodium chloride 27, of\r\n       sodium bromide 32, and of sodium iodide 41. The volume of silicon\r\n       chloroform, SiHCl_{3}, is 82, and those of the corresponding\r\n       bromine and iodine compounds are 108 and 122 respectively. The\r\n       same difference also exists in solutions; for example, NaCl +\r\n       200H_{2}O has a sp. gr. (at 15°/4°) of 1·0106, consequently the\r\n       volume of the solution 3,658·5/1·0106 = 3,620, hence the volume of\r\n       sodium chloride in solution = 3,620-3,603 (this is the volume of\r\n       200 H_{2}O) = 17, and in similar solutions, NaBr = 26 and NaI =\r\n       35.\r\n\r\nThe metallic bromides and iodides are in the majority of cases, in most\r\nrespects analogous to the corresponding chlorides,[65] but chlorine\r\ndisplaces the bromine and iodine from them, and bromine liberates iodine\r\nfrom iodides, which is taken advantage of in the preparation of these\r\nhalogens. However, the researches of Potilitzin showed that a _reverse_\r\ndisplacement of chlorine by bromine may occur both in solutions and in\r\nignited metallic chlorides in an atmosphere of bromine vapour--that is, a\r\ndistribution of the metal (according to Berthollet's doctrine) takes\r\nplace between the halogens, although however the larger portion, still\r\nunites with the chlorine, which shows its greater affinity for metals as\r\ncompared with that of bromine and iodine.[66] The latter, however,\r\nsometimes behave with respect to metallic oxides in exactly the same\r\nmanner as chlorine. Gay-Lussac, by igniting potassium carbonate in iodine\r\nvapour, obtained (as with chlorine) an evolution of oxygen and carbonic\r\nanhydride, K_{2}CO_{3} + I_{2} = 2KI + CO_{2} + O, only the reactions\r\nbetween the halogens and oxygen are more easily reversible with bromine\r\nand iodine than with chlorine. Thus, at a red heat oxygen displaces\r\niodine from barium iodide. Aluminium iodide burns in a current of oxygen\r\n(Deville and Troost), and a similar, although not so clearly marked,\r\nrelation exists for aluminium chloride, and shows that the halogens have\r\na distinctly smaller affinity for those metals which only form feeble\r\nbases. This is still more the case with the non-metals, which form acids\r\nand evolve much more heat with oxygen than with the halogens (Note 13).\r\nBut in all these instances the affinity (and amount of heat evolved) of\r\niodine and bromine is less than that of chlorine, probably because the\r\natomic weights are greater. The smaller store of energy in iodine and\r\nbromine is seen still more clearly in the relation of the halogens to\r\nhydrogen. In a gaseous state they all enter, with more or less ease, into\r\ndirect combination with gaseous hydrogen--for example, in the presence of\r\nspongy platinum, forming halogen acids, HX--but the latter are far from\r\nbeing equally stable; hydrogen chloride is the most stable, hydrogen\r\niodide the least so, and hydrogen bromide occupies an intermediate\r\nposition. A very high temperature is required to decompose hydrogen\r\nchloride even partially, whilst hydrogen iodide is decomposed by light\r\neven at the ordinary temperature and very easily by a red heat. Hence the\r\nreaction I_{2} + H_{2} = HI + HI is very easily reversible, and\r\nconsequently has a limit, and hydrogen iodide easily dissociates.[67]\r\nJudging by the direct measurement of the heat evolved (22,000 heat units)\r\nin the formation of HCl, the conversion of 2HCl into H_{2} + Cl_{2}\r\nrequires the expenditure of 44,000 heat units. The decomposition of 2HBr\r\ninto H_{2} + Br_{2} only requires, if the bromine be obtained in a\r\ngaseous state, a consumption of about 24,000 units, whilst in the\r\ndecomposition of 2HI into H_{2} + I_{2} as vapour about 3,000 heat units\r\nare _evolved_;[68] these facts, without doubt, stand in causal connection\r\nwith the great stability of hydrogen chloride, the easy decomposability\r\nof hydrogen iodide, and the intermediate properties of hydrogen bromide.\r\nFrom this it would be expected that chlorine is capable of decomposing\r\nwater with the evolution of oxygen, whilst iodine has not the energy to\r\nproduce this disengagement,[69] although it is able to liberate the\r\noxygen from the oxides of potassium and sodium, the affinity of these\r\nmetals for the halogens being very considerable. For this reason oxygen,\r\nespecially in compounds from which it can be evolved readily (for\r\ninstance, ClHO, CrO_{3}, &c.), easily decomposes hydrogen iodide. A\r\nmixture of hydrogen iodide and oxygen burns in the presence of an ignited\r\nsubstance, forming water and iodine. Drops of nitric acid in an\r\natmosphere of hydrogen iodide cause the disengagement of violet fumes of\r\niodine and brown fumes of nitric peroxide. In the presence of alkalis and\r\nan excess of water, however, iodine is able to effect oxidation like\r\nchlorine--that is, it decomposes water; the action is here aided by the\r\naffinity of hydrogen iodide for the alkali and water, just as sulphuric\r\nacid helps zinc to decompose water. But the relative instability of\r\nhydriodic acid is best seen in comparing the acids in a gaseous state. If\r\nthe halogen acids be dissolved in water, they evolve so much heat that\r\nthey approach much nearer to each other in properties. This is seen from\r\nthermochemical data, for in the formation of HX in solution (in a large\r\nexcess of water) from the _gaseous_ elements there is _evolved_ for HCl\r\n39,000, for HBr 32,000, and for HI 18,000 heat units.[70] But it is\r\nespecially evident from the fact that solutions of hydrogen bromide and\r\niodide in water have many points in common with solutions of hydrogen\r\nchloride, both in their capacity to form hydrates and fuming solutions of\r\nconstant boiling point, and in their capacity to form haloid salts, &c.\r\nby reacting on bases.\r\n\r\n  [65] But the density (and also molecular volume, Note 64) of a bromine\r\n       compound is always greater than that of a chlorine compound,\r\n       whilst that of an iodine compound is still greater. The order is\r\n       the same in many other respects. For example, an iodine compound\r\n       has a higher boiling point than a bromine compound, &c.\r\n\r\n  [66] A. L. Potilitzin showed that in heating various metallic chlorides\r\n       in a closed tube, with an equivalent quantity of bromine, a\r\n       distribution of the metal between the halogens always occurs, and\r\n       that the amounts of chlorine replaced by the bromine in the\r\n       ultimate product are proportional to the atomic weights of the\r\n       metals taken and inversely proportional to their equivalence.\r\n       Thus, if NaCl + Br be taken, then out of 100 parts of chlorine,\r\n       5·54 are replaced by the bromine, whilst with AgCl + Br 27·28\r\n       parts are replaced. These figures are in the ratio 1 : 4·9, and\r\n       the atomic weights Na : Ag = 1 : 4·7. In general terms, if a\r\n       chloride MCl_{_n_} be taken, it gives with _n_Br a percentage\r\n       substitution = 4M/_n_^2 where M is the atomic weight of the metal.\r\n       This law was deduced from observations on the chlorides of Li, K,\r\n       Na, Ag (_n_ = 1), Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Ni, Hg, Pb (_n_ = 2), Bi (_n_ =\r\n       3), Sn (_n_ = 4), and Fe_{2} (_n_ = 6).\r\n\r\n       In these determinations of Potilitzin we see not only a brilliant\r\n       confirmation of Berthollet's doctrine, but also the first effort\r\n       to directly determine the affinities of elements by means of\r\n       displacement. The chief object of these researches consisted in\r\n       proving whether a displacement occurs in those cases where heat is\r\n       absorbed, and in this instance it should be absorbed, because the\r\n       formation of all metallic bromides is attended with the evolution\r\n       of less heat than that of the chlorides, as is seen by the figures\r\n       given in Note 55.\r\n\r\n       If the mass of the bromine be increased, then the amount of\r\n       chlorine displaced also increases. For example, if masses of\r\n       bromine of 1 and 4 equivalents act on a molecule of sodium\r\n       chloride, then the percentages of the chlorine displaced will be\r\n       6·08 p.c. and 12·46 p.c.; in the action of 1, 4, 25, and 100\r\n       molecules of bromine on a molecule of barium chloride, there will\r\n       be displaced 7·8, 17·6, 35·0, and 45·0 p.c. of chlorine. If an\r\n       equivalent quantity of hydrochloric acid act on metallic bromides\r\n       in closed tubes, and in the absence of water at a temperature of\r\n       300°, then the percentages of the substitution of the bromine by\r\n       the chlorine in the double decomposition taking place between\r\n       univalent metals are inversely proportional to their atomic\r\n       weights. For example, NaBr + HCl gives at the limit 21 p.c. of\r\n       displacement, KCl 12 p.c. and AgCl 4-1/4 p.c. Essentially the same\r\n       action takes place in an aqueous solution, although the phenomenon\r\n       is complicated by the participation of the water. The reactions\r\n       proceed spontaneously in one or the other direction at the\r\n       ordinary temperature but at different _rates_. In the action of a\r\n       dilute solution (1 equivalent per 5 litres) of sodium chloride on\r\n       silver bromide at the ordinary temperature the amount of bromine\r\n       replaced in six and a half days is 2·07 p.c., and with potassium\r\n       chloride 1·5 p.c. With an excess of the chloride the magnitude of\r\n       the substitution increases. These conversions also proceed with\r\n       the absorption of heat. The reverse reactions evolving heat\r\n       proceed incomparably more rapidly, but also to a certain limit;\r\n       for example, in the reaction AgCl + RBr the following percentages\r\n       of silver bromide are formed in different times:\r\n\r\n               hours    2       3      22      96     120\r\n                K     79·82   87·4    88·22    --     94·21\r\n                Na    83·63   90·74   91·70   95·49    --\r\n\r\n       That is, the conversions which are accompanied by an evolution of\r\n       heat proceed with very much greater rapidity than the reverse\r\n       conversions.\r\n\r\n  [67] _The dissociation of hydriodic acid_ has been studied in detail by\r\n       Hautefeuille and Lemoine, from whose researches we extract the\r\n       following information. The decomposition of hydriodic acid is\r\n       decided, but proceeds slowly at 180°; the rate and limit of\r\n       decomposition increase with a rise of temperature. The reverse\r\n       action--that is, I_{2} + H_{2} = 2HI--proceeds not only under the\r\n       influence of spongy platinum (Corenwinder), which also accelerates\r\n       the decomposition of hydriodic acid, but also by itself, although\r\n       slowly. The limit of the reverse reaction remains the same with or\r\n       without spongy platinum. An increase of pressure has a very\r\n       powerful accelerative effect on the rate of formation of hydriodic\r\n       acid, and therefore spongy platinum by condensing gases has the\r\n       same effect as increase of pressure. At the atmospheric pressure\r\n       the decomposition of hydriodic acid reaches the limit at 250° in\r\n       several months, and at 440° in several hours. The limit at 250° is\r\n       about 18 p.c. of decomposition--that is, out of 100 parts of\r\n       hydrogen previously combined in hydriodic acid, about 18 p.c. may\r\n       be disengaged at this temperature (this hydrogen may be easily\r\n       measured, and the measure of dissociation determined), but not\r\n       more; the limit at 440° is about 26 p.c. If the pressure under\r\n       which 2HI passes into H_{2} + I_{2} be 4-1/2 atmospheres, then the\r\n       limit is 24 p.c.; under a pressure of 1/5 atmosphere the limit is\r\n       29 p.c. The small influence of pressure on the dissociation of\r\n       hydriodic acid (compared with N_{2}O_{4}, Chapter VI. Note 46) is\r\n       due to the fact that the reaction 2HI = I_{2} + H_{2} is not\r\n       accompanied by a change of volume. In order to show the influence\r\n       of time, we will cite the following figures referring to 350°: (1)\r\n       Reaction H_{2} + I_{2}; after 3 hours, 88 p.c. of hydrogen remained\r\n       free; 8 hours, 69 p.c.; 34 hours, 48 p.c.; 76 hours, 29 p.c.; and\r\n       327 hours, 18·5 p.c. (2) The reverse decomposition of 2HI; after 9\r\n       hours, 3 p.c. of hydrogen was set free, and after 250 hours 18·6\r\n       p.c.--that is, the limit was reached. The addition of extraneous\r\n       hydrogen diminishes the limit of the reaction of decomposition, or\r\n       increases the formation of hydriodic acid from iodine and\r\n       hydrogen, as would be expected from Berthollet's doctrine (Chapter\r\n       X.). Thus at 440° 26 p.c. of hydriodic acid is decomposed if there\r\n       be no admixture of hydrogen, while if H_{2} be added, then at the\r\n       limit only half as large a mass of HI is decomposed. Therefore, if\r\n       an infinite mass of hydrogen be added there will be no\r\n       decomposition of the hydriodic acid. Light aids the decomposition\r\n       of hydriodic acid very powerfully. At the ordinary temperature 80\r\n       p.c. is decomposed under the influence of light, whilst under the\r\n       influence of heat alone this limit corresponds with a very high\r\n       temperature. The distinct action of light, spongy platinum, and of\r\n       impurities in glass (especially of sodium sulphate, which\r\n       decomposes hydriodic acid), not only render the investigations\r\n       difficult, but also show that in reactions like 2HI = I_{2} + H_{2},\r\n       which are accompanied by slight heat effects, all foreign and\r\n       feeble influences may strongly affect the progress of the action\r\n       (Note 47).\r\n\r\n  [68] The thermal determinations of Thomsen (at 18°) gave in thousands\r\n       of calories, Cl + H = +22, HCl + Aq (that is, on dissolving HCl in\r\n       a large amount of water) = +17·3, and therefore H + Cl + Aq =\r\n       +39·3. In taking molecules, all these figures must be doubled. Br\r\n       + H = +8·4; HBr + Aq = 19·9; H + Br + Aq = +28·3. According to\r\n       Berthelot 7·2 are required for the vaporisation of Br_{2}, hence\r\n       Br_{2} + H_{2} = 16·8 + 7·2 = +24, if Br_{2} be taken as vapour\r\n       for comparison with Cl_{2}. H + I =-6·0, HI + Aq = 19·2; H + I +\r\n       Aq= +13·2, and, according to Berthelot, the heat of fusion of\r\n       I_{2} = 3·0, and of vaporisation 6·0 thousand heat units, and\r\n       therefore I_{2} + H_{2} =-2(6·0) + 3 + 6 =-3·0, if the iodine be\r\n       taken as vapour. Berthelot, on the basis of his determinations,\r\n       gives, however, +0·8 thousand heat units. Similar contradictory\r\n       results are often met with in thermochemistry owing to the\r\n       imperfection of the existing methods, and particularly the\r\n       necessity of depending on indirect methods for obtaining the\r\n       fundamental figures. Thus Thomsen decomposed a dilute solution of\r\n       potassium iodide by gaseous chlorine; the reaction gave +26·2,\r\n       whence, having first determined the heat effects of the reactions\r\n       KHO + HCl, KHO + HI and Cl + H in aqueous solutions, it was\r\n       possible to find H + I + Aq; then, knowing HI + Aq, to find I + H.\r\n       It is evident that unavoidable errors may accumulate.\r\n\r\n  [69] One can believe, however, on the basis of Berthollet's doctrine,\r\n       and the observations of Potilitzin (Note 66), that a certain slow\r\n       decomposition of water by iodine takes place. On this view the\r\n       observations of Dossios and Weith on the fact that the solubility\r\n       of iodine in water increases after the lapse of several months\r\n       will be comprehensible. Hydriodic acid is then formed, and it\r\n       increases the solubility. If the iodine be extracted from such a\r\n       solution by carbon bisulphide, then, as the authors showed, after\r\n       the action of nitrous anhydride iodine may be again detected in\r\n       the solution by means of starch. It can easily be understood that\r\n       a number of similar reactions, requiring much time and taking\r\n       place in small quantities, have up to now eluded the attention of\r\n       investigators, who even still doubt the universal application of\r\n       Berthollet's doctrine, or only see the thermochemical side of\r\n       reactions, or else neglect to pay attention to the element of time\r\n       and the influence of mass.\r\n\r\n  [70] On the basis of the data in Note 68.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of what has been said above, it follows that _hydrobromic\r\nand hydriodic acids_, being substances which are but slightly stable,\r\ncannot be evolved in a gaseous state under many of those conditions under\r\nwhich hydrochloric acid is formed. Thus if sulphuric acid in solution\r\nacts on sodium iodide, all the same phenomena take place as with sodium\r\nchloride (a portion of the sodium iodide gives hydriodic acid, and all\r\nremains in solution), but if sodium iodide be mixed with strong sulphuric\r\nacid, then the oxygen of the latter decomposes the hydriodic acid set\r\nfree, with liberation of iodine, H_{2}SO_{4} + 2HI = 2H_{2}O + SO_{2} +\r\nI_{2}. This reaction takes place in the reverse direction in the presence\r\nof a _large quantity_ of water (2,000 parts of water per 1 part of\r\nSO_{2}), in which case not only the affinity of hydriodic acid for water\r\nis brought to light but also the action of water in directing chemical\r\nreactions in which it participates.[71] Therefore, with a halogen salt,\r\nit is easy to obtain gaseous hydrochloric acid by the action of sulphuric\r\nacid, but neither hydrobromic nor hydriodic acid can be so obtained in\r\nthe free state (as gases).[72] Other methods have to be resorted to for\r\ntheir preparation, and recourse must not be had to compounds of oxygen,\r\nwhich are so easily able to destroy these acids. Therefore hydrogen\r\nsulphide, phosphorus, &c., which themselves easily take up oxygen, are\r\nintroduced as means for the conversion of bromine and iodine into\r\nhydrobromic and hydriodic acids in the presence of water. For example, in\r\nthe action of phosphorus the essence of the matter is that the oxygen of\r\nthe water goes to the phosphorus, and the union of the remaining\r\nelements leads to the formation of hydrobromic or hydriodic acid; but the\r\nmatter is complicated by the reversibility of the reaction, the affinity\r\nfor water, and other circumstances which are understood by following\r\nBerthollet's doctrine. Chlorine (and bromine also) directly decomposes\r\nhydrogen sulphide, forming hydrochloric acid and liberating sulphur, both\r\nin a gaseous form and in solutions, whilst iodine only decomposes\r\nhydrogen sulphide in weak solutions, when its affinity for hydrogen is\r\naided by the affinity of hydrogen iodide for water. In a gaseous state\r\niodine does not act on hydrogen sulphide,[73] whilst sulphur is able to\r\ndecompose gaseous hydriodic acid, forming hydrogen sulphide and a\r\ncompound of sulphur and iodine which with water forms hydriodic acid.[74]\r\n\r\n  [71] A number of similar cases confirm what has been said in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n  [72] This is prevented by the reducibility of sulphuric acid. If\r\n       volatile acids be taken they pass over, together with the\r\n       hydrobromic and hydriodic acids, when distilled; whilst many\r\n       non-volatile acids which are not reduced by hydrobromic and\r\n       hydriodic acids only act feebly (like phosphoric acid), or do not\r\n       act at all (like boric acid).\r\n\r\n  [73] This is in agreement with the thermochemical data, because if all\r\n       the substances be taken in the gaseous state (for sulphur the heat\r\n       of fusion is 0·3, and the heat of vaporisation 2·3) we have H_{2}\r\n       + S = 4·7; H_{2} + Cl_{2} = 44; H_{2} + Br_{2} = 24, and H_{2} +\r\n       I_{2} = -3 thousand heat units; hence the formation of H_{2}S\r\n       gives less heat than that of HCl and HBr, but more than that of\r\n       HI. In dilute solutions H_{2} + S + Aq = 9·3, and consequently\r\n       less than the formation of all the halogen acids, as H_{2}S\r\n       evolves but little heat with water, and therefore in dilute\r\n       solutions chlorine, bromine, and iodine decompose hydrogen\r\n       sulphide.\r\n\r\n  [74] Here there are three elements, hydrogen, sulphur, and iodine, each\r\n       pair of which is able to form a compound, HI, H_{2}S, and SI,\r\n       besides which the latter may unite in various proportions. The\r\n       complexity of chemical mechanics is seen in such examples as\r\n       these. It is evident that only the study of the simplest cases can\r\n       give the key to the more complex problems, and on the other hand\r\n       it is evident from the examples cited in the last pages that,\r\n       without penetrating into the conditions of chemical equilibria, it\r\n       would be impossible to explain chemical phenomena. By following\r\n       the footsteps of Berthollet the possibility of unravelling the\r\n       problems will be reached; but work in this direction has only been\r\n       begun during the last ten years, and much remains to be done in\r\n       collecting experimental material, for which occasions present\r\n       themselves at every step. In speaking of the halogens I wished to\r\n       turn the reader's attention to problems of this kind.\r\n\r\nIf hydrogen sulphide be passed through water containing iodine, the\r\nreaction H_{2}S + I_{2} = 2HI + S proceeds so long as the solution is\r\ndilute, but when the mass of free HI increases the reaction stops,\r\nbecause the iodine then passes into solution. A solution having a\r\ncomposition approximating to 2HI + 4I_{2} + 9H_{2}O (according to Bineau)\r\ndoes not react with H_{2}S, notwithstanding the quantity of free iodine.\r\nTherefore only weak solutions of hydriodic acid can be obtained by\r\npassing hydrogen sulphide into water with iodine.[74 bis]\r\n\r\n  [74 bis] The same essentially takes place when sulphurous anhydride,\r\n       in a dilute solution, gives hydriodic acid and sulphuric acid with\r\n       iodine. On concentration a reverse reaction takes place. The\r\n       equilibrated systems and the part played by water are everywhere\r\n       distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nTo obtain[75] gaseous hydrobromic and hydriodic acids it is most\r\nconvenient to take advantage of the reactions between phosphorus, the\r\nhalogens, and water, the latter being present in small quantity\r\n(otherwise the halogen acids formed are dissolved by it); the halogen is\r\ngradually added to the phosphorus moistened with water. Thus if red\r\nphosphorus be placed in a flask and moistened with water, and bromine be\r\nadded drop by drop (from a tap funnel), hydrobromic acid is abundantly\r\nand uniformly disengaged.[76] Hydrogen iodide is prepared by adding 1\r\npart of common (yellow) dry phosphorus to 10 parts of dry iodine in a\r\nglass flask. On shaking the flask, union proceeds quietly between them\r\n(light and heat being evolved), and when the mass of iodide of phosphorus\r\nwhich is formed has cooled, water is added drop by drop (from a tap\r\nfunnel) and hydrogen iodide is evolved directly without the aid of heat.\r\nThese methods of preparation will be at once understood when it is\r\nremembered (p. 468) that phosphorus chloride gives hydrogen chloride with\r\nwater. It is exactly the same here--the oxygen of the water passes over\r\nto the phosphorus, and the hydrogen to the iodine, thus, PI_{3} +\r\n3H_{2}O = PH_{3}O_{3} + 3HI.[77]\r\n\r\n  [75] Methods of formation and preparation are nothing more than\r\n       particular cases of chemical reaction. If the knowledge of\r\n       chemical mechanics were more exact and complete than it now is it\r\n       would be possible to foretell all cases of preparation _with every\r\n       detail_ (of the quantity of water, temperature, pressure, mass,\r\n       &c.) The study of practical methods of preparation is therefore\r\n       one of the paths for the study of chemical mechanics. The reaction\r\n       of iodine on phosphorus and water is a case like that mentioned in\r\n       Note 74, and the matter is here further complicated by the\r\n       possibility of the formation of the compound PH_{3} with HI, as\r\n       well as the production of PI_{2}, PI_{3}, and the affinity of\r\n       hydriodic acid and the acids of phosphorus for water. The\r\n       theoretical interest of equilibria in all their complexity is\r\n       naturally very great, but it falls into the background in presence\r\n       of the primary interest of discovering practical methods for the\r\n       isolation of substances, and the means of employing them for the\r\n       requirements of man. It is only after the satisfaction of these\r\n       requirements that interests of the other order arise, which in\r\n       their turn must exert an influence on the former. For these\r\n       reasons, whilst considering it opportune to point out the\r\n       theoretical interest of chemical equilibria, the chief attention\r\n       of the reader is directed in this work to questions of practical\r\n       importance.\r\n\r\n  [76] Hydrobromic acid is also obtained by the action of bromine on\r\n       paraffin heated to 180°. Gustavson proposed to prepare it by the\r\n       action of bromine (best added in drops together with traces of\r\n       aluminium bromide) on anthracene (a solid hydrocarbon from coal\r\n       tar). Balard prepared it by passing bromine vapour over moist\r\n       pieces of common phosphorus. The liquid tribromide of phosphorus,\r\n       directly obtained from phosphorus and bromine, also gives\r\n       hydrobromic acid when treated with water. Bromide of potassium or\r\n       sodium, when treated with sulphuric acid in the presence of\r\n       phosphorus, also gives hydrobromic acid, but hydriodic acid is\r\n       decomposed by this method. In order to free hydrobromic acid from\r\n       bromine vapour it is passed over moist phosphorus and dried either\r\n       by phosphoric anhydride or calcium bromide (calcium chloride\r\n       cannot be used, as hydrochloric acid would be formed). Neither\r\n       hydrobromic nor hydriodic acids can be collected over mercury, on\r\n       which they act, but they may be directly collected in a dry vessel\r\n       by leading the gas-conducting tube to the bottom of the vessel,\r\n       both gases being much heavier than air. Merz and Holtzmann (1889)\r\n       proposed to prepare HBr directly from bromine and hydrogen. For\r\n       this purpose pure dry hydrogen is passed through a flask\r\n       containing boiling bromine. The mixture of gas and vapour then\r\n       passes through a tube provided with one or two bulbs, which is\r\n       heated moderately in the middle. Hydrobromic acid is formed with a\r\n       series of flashes at the part heated. The resultant HBr, together\r\n       with traces of bromine, passes into a Woulfe's bottle into which\r\n       hydrogen is also introduced, and the mixture is then carried\r\n       through another heated tube, after which it is passed through\r\n       water which dissolves the hydrobromic acid. According to the\r\n       method proposed by Newth (1892) a mixture of bromine and hydrogen\r\n       is led through a tube containing a platinum spiral, which is\r\n       heated to redness after the air has been displaced from the tube.\r\n       If the vessel containing the bromine be kept at 60°, the hydrogen\r\n       takes up almost the theoretical amount of bromine required for the\r\n       formation of HBr. Although the flame which appears in the\r\n       neighbourhood of the platinum spiral does not penetrate into the\r\n       vessel containing the bromine, still, for safety, a tube filled\r\n       with cotton wool may be interposed.\r\n\r\n       Hydroiodic acid is obtained in the same manner as hydrobromic. The\r\n       iodine is heated in a small flask, and its vapour is carried over\r\n       by hydrogen into a strongly heated tube, The gas passing from the\r\n       tube is found to contain a considerable amount of HI, together\r\n       with some free iodine. At a low red heat about 17 p.c. of the\r\n       iodine vapour enters into combination; at a higher temperature, 78\r\n       p.c. to 79 p.c.; and at a strong heat about 82 p.c.\r\n\r\n  [77] But generally more phosphorus is taken than is required for the\r\n       formation of PI_{3}, because otherwise a portion of the iodine\r\n       distils over. If less than one-tenth part of iodine be taken, much\r\n       phosphonium iodide, PH_{4}I, is formed. This proportion was\r\n       established by Gay-Lussac and Kolbe. Hydriodic acid is also\r\n       prepared in many other ways. Bannoff dissolves two parts of iodine\r\n       in one part of a previously prepared strong (sp. gr. 1·67)\r\n       solution of hydriodic acid, and pours it on to red phosphorus in a\r\n       retort. Personne takes a mixture of fifteen parts of water, ten of\r\n       iodine, and one of red phosphorus, which, when heated, disengages\r\n       hydriodic acid mixed with iodine vapour; the latter is removed by\r\n       passing it over moist phosphorus (Note 76). It must be remembered\r\n       however that reverse reaction (Oppenheim) may take place between\r\n       the hydriodic acid and phosphorus, in which the compounds PH_{4}I\r\n       and PI_{2} are formed.\r\n\r\n       It should be observed that the reaction between phosphorus, iodine\r\n       and water must be carried out in the above proportions and with\r\n       caution, as they may react with explosion. With red phosphorus the\r\n       reaction proceeds quietly, but nevertheless requires care.\r\n\r\n       L. Meyer showed that with an excess of iodine the reaction\r\n       proceeds without the formation of bye-products (PH_{4}I),\r\n       according to the equation P + 5I + 4H_{2}O = PH_{3}O_{4} + 5HI.\r\n       For this purpose 100 grams of iodine and 10 grams of water are\r\n       placed in a retort, and a paste of 5 grams of red phosphorus and\r\n       10 grams of water is added little by little (at first with great\r\n       care). The hydriodic acid may be obtained free from iodine by\r\n       directing the neck of the retort upwards and causing the gas to\r\n       pass through a shallow layer of water (respecting the formation of\r\n       HI, _see_ also Note 75).\r\n\r\nIn a gaseous form hydrobromic and hydriodic acids are closely analogous\r\nto hydrochloric acid; they are liquefied by pressure and cold, they fume\r\nin the air, form solutions and hydrates, of constant boiling point, and\r\nreact on metals, oxides and salts, &c.[78] Only the relatively easy\r\ndecomposability of hydrobromic acid and especially of hydriodic acid,\r\nclearly distinguish these acids from hydrochloric acid. For this reason,\r\nhydriodic acid acts in a number of cases as a deoxidiser or reducer, and\r\nfrequently even serves as a means for the transference of hydrogen. Thus\r\nBerthelot, Baeyer, Wreden, and others, by heating unsaturated\r\nhydrocarbons in a solution of hydriodic acid, obtained their compounds\r\nwith hydrogen nearer to the limit C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2} or even the\r\nsaturated compounds. For example, benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, when heated in a\r\nclosed tube with a strong solution of hydriodic acid, gives hexylene,\r\nC_{6}H_{12}. The easy decomposability of hydriodic acid accounts for the\r\nfact that iodine does not act by metalepsis on hydrocarbons, for the\r\nhydrogen iodide liberated with the product of metalepsis, RI, formed,\r\ngives iodine and the hydrogen compound, RH, back again. And therefore, to\r\nobtain the products of iodine substitution, either iodic acid, HIO_{3}\r\n(Kekulé), or mercury oxide, HgO (Weselsky), is added, as they immediately\r\nreact on the hydrogen iodide, thus: HIO_{3} + 5HI = 3H_{2}O + 3I_{2}, or,\r\nHgO + 2HI = HgI_{2} + H_{2}O. From these considerations it will be\r\nreadily understood that iodine acts like chlorine (or bromine) on ammonia\r\nand sodium hydroxide, for in these cases the hydriodic acid produced\r\nforms NH_{4}I and NaI. With tincture of iodine or even the solid element,\r\na solution of ammonia immediately forms a highly-explosive solid black\r\nproduct of metalepsis, NHI_{2}, generally known as _iodide_ of\r\n_nitrogen_, although it still contains hydrogen (this was proved beyond\r\ndoubt by Szuhay 1893), which may be replaced by silver (with the\r\nformation of NAgI_{2}): 3NH_{3} + 2I_{2} = 2NH_{4}I + NHI_{2}. However,\r\nthe composition of the last product is variable, and with an excess of\r\nwater NI_{3} seems to be formed. Iodide of nitrogen is just as explosive\r\nas nitrogen chloride.[78 bis] In the action of iodine on sodium\r\nhydroxide no bleaching compound is formed (whilst bromine gives one), but\r\na direct reaction is always accomplished with the formation of an iodate,\r\n6NaHO + 3I_{2} = 5NaI + 3H_{2}O + NaIO_{3} (Gay-Lussac). Solutions of\r\nother alkalis, and even a mixture of water and oxide of mercury, act in\r\nthe same manner.[79] This direct formation of _iodic acid_, HIO_{3} =\r\nIO_{2}(OH), shows the propensity of iodine to give compounds of the type\r\nIX_{5}. Indeed, this capacity of iodine to form compounds of a high type\r\nemphasises itself in many ways. But it is most important to turn\r\nattention to the fact that iodic acid is easily and directly formed by\r\nthe action of oxidising substances on iodine. Thus, for instance, strong\r\nnitric acid directly converts iodine into iodic acid, whilst it has no\r\noxidising action on chlorine.[79 bis] This shows a greater affinity in\r\niodine for oxygen than in chlorine, and this conclusion is confirmed by\r\nthe fact that iodine displaces chlorine from its oxygen acids,[80] and\r\nthat in the presence of water chlorine oxidises iodine.[81] Even ozone or\r\na silent discharge passed through a mixture of oxygen and iodine vapour\r\nis able to directly oxidise iodine[82] into iodic acid. It is disengaged\r\nfrom solutions as a hydrate, HIO_{3}, which loses water at 170°, and\r\ngives an anhydride, I_{2}O_{5}. Both these substances are crystalline\r\n(sp. gr. I_{2}O_{5} 5·037, HIO_{3} 4·869 at 0°), colourless and soluble\r\nin water;[83] both decompose at a red heat into iodine and oxygen, are in\r\nmany cases powerfully oxidising--for instance, they oxidise sulphurous\r\nanhydride, hydrogen sulphide, carbonic oxide, &c.--form chloride of\r\niodine and water with hydrochloric acid, and with bases form salts, not\r\nonly normal MIO_{3}, but also acid; for example, KIO_{3}HIO_{3},\r\nKIO_{3}2HIO_{3}.[83 bis] With hydriodic acid iodic acid immediately\r\nreacts, disengaging iodine, HIO_{3} + 5HI = 3H_{2}O + 3I_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [78] The specific gravities of their solutions as deduced by me on the\r\n       basis of Topsöe and Berthelot's determinations for 15°/4° are as\r\n       follows:--\r\n\r\n                   10      20      30      40      50   60 p.c.\r\n           HBr   1·071   1·156   1·258   1·374   1·505   1·650\r\n           HI    1·075   1·164   1·267   1·399   1·567   1·769\r\n\r\n       Hydrobromic acid forms two hydrates, HBr,2H_{2}O and HBr,H_{2}O,\r\n       which have been studied by Roozeboom with as much completeness as\r\n       the hydrate of hydrochloric acid (Chapter X. Note 37).\r\n\r\n       With metallic silver, solutions of hydriodic acid give hydrogen\r\n       with great ease, forming silver iodide. Mercury, lead, and other\r\n       metals act in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n  [78 bis] Iodide of nitrogen, NHI_{2} is obtained as a brown pulverulent\r\n       precipitate on adding a solution of iodine (in alcohol, for\r\n       instance) to a solution of ammonia. If it be collected on a\r\n       filter-paper, it does not decompose so long as the precipitate is\r\n       moist; but when dry it explodes violently, so that it can only be\r\n       experimented upon in small quantities. Usually the filter-paper is\r\n       torn into bits while moist, and the pieces laid upon a brick; on\r\n       drying an explosion proceeds not only from friction or a blow, but\r\n       even spontaneously. The more dilute the solution of ammonia, the\r\n       greater is the amount of iodine required for the formation of the\r\n       precipitate of NHI_{2}. A low temperature facilitates its\r\n       formation. NHI_{2} dissolves in ammonia water, and when heated the\r\n       solution forms HIO_{3} and iodine. With KI, iodide of nitrogen\r\n       gives iodine, NH_{3} and KHO. These reactions (Selivanoff) are\r\n       explained by the formation of HIO from NHI_{2} + 2H_{2}O = NH_{3} +\r\n       2HIO--and then KI + HIO = I_{2} + KHO. Selivanoff (_see_ Note 29)\r\n       usually observed a temporary formation of hypoiodous acid, HIO, in\r\n       the reaction of ammonia upon iodine, so that here the formation of\r\n       NHI_{2} is preceded by that of HIO--_i.e._ first I_{2} + H_{2}O =\r\n       HIO + HI, and then not only the HI combines with NH_{3}, but also\r\n       2HIO + NH_{3} = NHI_{2} + 2H_{2}O. With dilute sulphuric acid\r\n       iodide of nitrogen (like NCl_{3}) forms hypoiodous acid, but it\r\n       immediately passes into iodic acid, as is expressed by the\r\n       equation 5HIO = 2I_{2} + HIO_{3} + 2H_{2}O (first 3HIO = HIO_{3} +\r\n       2HI, and then HI + HIO = I_{2} + H_{2}O). Moreover, Selivanoff\r\n       found that iodide of nitrogen, NHI_{2}, dissolves in an excess of\r\n       ammonia water, and that with potassium iodide the solution gives\r\n       the reaction for hypoiodous acid (the evolution of iodine in an\r\n       alkaline solution). This shows that HIO participates in the\r\n       formation and decomposition of NHI_{2}, and therefore the\r\n       condition of the iodine (its metaleptic position) in them is\r\n       analogous, and differs from the condition of the halogens in the\r\n       haloid-anhydrides (for instance, NO_{2}Cl). The latter are\r\n       tolerably stable, while (the haloid being designated by X)\r\n       NHX_{2}, NX_{3}, XOH, RXO (_see_ Chapter XIII. Note 43), &c., are\r\n       unstable, easily decomposed with the evolution of heat, and, under\r\n       the action of water, the haloid is easily replaced by hydrogen\r\n       (Selivanoff), as would be expected in true products of metalepsis.\r\n\r\n  [79] Hypoiodous acid, HIO, is not known, but organic compounds, RIO, of\r\n       this type are known. To illustrate the peculiarities of their\r\n       properties we will mention one of these compounds, namely,\r\n       _iodosobenzol_, C_{6}H_{5}IO. This substance was obtained by\r\n       Willgerodt (1892), and also by V. Meyer, Wachter, and Askenasy, by\r\n       the action of caustic alkalis upon phenoldiiodochloride,\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}ICl_{2} (according to the equation, C_{6}H_{5}ICl_{2} +\r\n       2MOH = C_{6}H_{5}IO + 2MCl + H_{2}O). Iodosobenzol is an amorphous\r\n       yellow substance, whose melting point could not be determined\r\n       because it explodes at 210°, decomposing with the evolution of\r\n       iodine vapour. This substance dissolves in hot water and alcohol,\r\n       but is not soluble in the majority of other neutral organic\r\n       solvents. If acids do not oxidise C_{6}H_{5}IO, they give saline\r\n       compounds in which iodosobenzol appears as a basic oxide of a\r\n       diatomic metal, C_{6}H_{5}I. Thus, for instance, when an acetic\r\n       acid solution of iodosobenzol is treated with a solution of nitric\r\n       acid, it gives large monoclinic crystals of a nitric acid salt\r\n       having the composition C_{6}H_{5}I(NO_{3})_{2} (like\r\n       Ca(NO_{3})_{2}). In appearing as the analogue of basic oxides,\r\n       iodosobenzol displaces iodine from potassium iodide (in a solution\r\n       acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric acid)--_i.e._ it acts with\r\n       its oxygen like HClO. The action of peroxide of hydrogen, chromic\r\n       acid, and other similar oxidising agents gives iodoxybenzol,\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}IO_{2}, which is a neutral substance--_i.e._ incapable\r\n       of giving salts with acids (compare Chapter XIII. Note 43).\r\n\r\n  [79 bis] The oxidation of iodine by strong nitric acid was discovered\r\n       by Connell; Millon showed that it is effected, although more\r\n       slowly, by the action of the hydrates of nitric acid up to\r\n       HNO_{3},H_{2}O, but that the solution HNO_{3},2H_{2}O, and weaker\r\n       solutions, do not oxidise, but simply dissolve, iodine. The\r\n       participation of water in reactions is seen in this instance. It\r\n       is also seen, for example, in the fact that dry ammonia combines\r\n       directly with iodine--for instance, at 0° forming the compound\r\n       I_{2},4NH_{3}--whilst iodide of nitrogen is only formed in\r\n       presence of water.\r\n\r\n  [80] Bromine also displaces chlorine--for instance, from chloric acid,\r\n       directly forming bromic acid. If a solution of potassium chlorate\r\n       be taken (75 parts per 400 parts of water), and iodine be added to\r\n       it (80 parts), and then a small quantity of nitric acid, chlorine\r\n       is disengaged on boiling, and potassium iodate is formed in the\r\n       solution. In this instance the nitric acid first evolves a certain\r\n       portion of the chloric acid, and the latter, with the iodine,\r\n       evolves chlorine. The iodic acid thus formed acts on a further\r\n       quantity of the potassium chlorate, sets a portion of the chloric\r\n       acid free, and in this manner the action is kept up. Potilitzin\r\n       (1887) remarked, however, that not only do bromine and iodine\r\n       displace the chlorine from chloric acid and potassium chlorate,\r\n       but also chlorine displaces bromine from sodium bromate, and,\r\n       furthermore, the reaction does not proceed as a direct\r\n       substitution of the halogens, but is accompanied by the formation\r\n       of free acids; for example, 5NaClO_{3} + 3Br_{2} + 3H_{2}O = 5NaBr\r\n       + 5HClO_{3} + HBrO_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [81] If iodine be stirred up in water, and chlorine passed through the\r\n       mixture, the iodine is dissolved; the liquid becomes colourless,\r\n       and contains, according to the relative amounts of water and\r\n       chlorine, either IHCl_{2}, or ICl_{3}, or HIO_{3}. If there be a\r\n       small amount of water, then the iodic acid may separate out\r\n       directly as crystals, but a complete conversion (Bornemann) only\r\n       occurs when not less than ten parts of water are taken to one part\r\n       of iodine--ICl + 3H_{2}O + 2Cl_{2} = IHO_{3} + 5HCl.\r\n\r\n  [82] Schönbein and Ogier proved this. Ogier found that at 45° ozone\r\n       immediately oxidises iodine vapour, forming first of all the oxide\r\n       I_{2}O_{3}, which is decomposed by water or on heating into iodic\r\n       anhydride and iodine. Iodic acid is formed at the positive pole\r\n       when a solution of hydriodic acid is decomposed by a galvanic\r\n       current (Riche). It is also formed in the combustion of hydrogen\r\n       mixed with a small quantity of hydriodic acid (Salet).\r\n\r\n  [83] Kämmerer showed that a solution of sp. gr. 2·127 at 14°,\r\n       containing 2HIO_{3},9H_{2}O, solidified completely in the cold. On\r\n       comparing solutions HI + _m_H_{2}O with HIO_{3} + _m_H_{2}O, we\r\n       find that the specific gravity increases but the volume decreases,\r\n       whilst in the passage of solutions HCl + _m_H_{2}O to HClO_{3} +\r\n       _m_H_{2}O both the specific gravity and the volume increase, which\r\n       is also observed in certain other cases (for example, H_{3}PO_{3}\r\n       and H_{3}PO_{4}).\r\n\r\n  [83 bis] Ditte (1890) obtained many iodates of great variety. A neutral\r\n       salt, 2(LiIO_{3})H_{2}O, is obtained by saturating a solution of\r\n       lithia with iodic acid. There is an analogous ammonium salt,\r\n       2(NH_{4}IO_{3})H_{2}O. He also obtained hydrates of a more complex\r\n       composition, such as 6(NH_{4}IO_{3})H_{2}O and\r\n       6(NH_{4}IO_{3})2H_{2}O. Salts of the alkaline earths,\r\n       Ba(IO_{3})_{2}H_{2}O and Sr(IO_{3})_{2}H_{2}O, may be obtained by\r\n       a reaction of double decomposition from the normal salts of the\r\n       type 2(MeIO_{3})H_{2}O. When evaporated at 70° to 80° with nitric\r\n       acid these salts lose water. A mixture of solutions of nitrate of\r\n       zinc and an alkaline iodate precipitates Zn(IO_{3})_{2}2H_{2}O. An\r\n       anhydrous salt is thrown out if nitric acid be added to the\r\n       solutions. Analogous salts of cadmium, silver, and copper give\r\n       compounds of the type 2Me´IO_{3}4NH_{3} and\r\n       Me´´(IO_{3})_{2}4NH_{3}, with gaseous ammonia (Me´ and Me´´ being\r\n       elements of the first (Ag) and second (Cd, Zn, Cu) groups). With\r\n       an aqueous solution of ammonia the above salts give substances of\r\n       a different composition, such as Zn(IO_{3})_{2}(NH_{4})_{2}O,\r\n       Cd(IO_{3})_{2}(NH_{4})_{2}O. Copper gives\r\n       Cu(IO_{3})_{2}4(NH_{4})_{2}O and Cu(IO_{3})_{2}(NH_{4})_{2}O.\r\n       These salts may be regarded as compounds of I_{2}O_{5}, and MeO\r\n       and (NH_{4})_{2}O; for example, Zn(IO_{3})_{2}(NH_{4})_{2}O may be\r\n       regarded as ZnO(NH_{4})_{2}OI_{2}O_{5}, or, as derived from the\r\n       hydrate, I_{2}O_{5}2H_{2}O = 2(HIO_{3})H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nAs with chlorine, so with iodine, a _periodic acid_, HIO_{4}, is formed.\r\nThis acid is produced in the form of its salts, by the action of chlorine\r\non alkaline solutions of iodates, and also by the action of iodine on\r\nchloric acid.[84] It crystallises from solutions as a hydrate containing\r\n2H_{2}O (corresponding with HClO_{4},2H_{2}O), but as it forms salts\r\ncontaining up to 5 atoms of metals, this water must be counted as water\r\nof constitution. Therefore IO(OH)_{5} = HIO_{4},2H_{2}O corresponds with\r\nthe highest form of halogen compounds, IX_{7}.[85] In decomposing (at\r\n200°) or acting as an oxidiser, periodic acid first gives iodic acid, but\r\nit may also be ultimately decomposed.\r\n\r\n  [84] If sodium iodate be mixed with a solution of sodium hydroxide,\r\n       heated, and chlorine passed through the solution, a sparingly\r\n       soluble salt separates out, which corresponds with periodic acid,\r\n       and has the composition Na_{4}I_{2}O_{9},3H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n        6NaHO + 2NaIO_{3} + 4Cl = 4NaCl + Na_{4}I_{2}O_{9} + 3H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n       This compound is sparingly soluble in water, but dissolves easily\r\n       in a very dilute solution of nitric acid. If silver nitrate be\r\n       added to this solution a precipitate is formed which contains the\r\n       corresponding compound of silver, Ag_{4}I_{2}O_{9},3H_{2}O. If\r\n       this sparingly soluble silver compound be dissolved in hot nitric\r\n       acid, orange crystals of a salt having the composition AgIO_{4}\r\n       separate on evaporation. This salt is formed from the preceding by\r\n       the nitric acid taking up silver oxide--Ag_{4}I_{2}O_{9} +\r\n       2HNO_{3} = 2AgNO_3 + 2AgIO_{4} + H_{2}O. The silver salt is\r\n       decomposed by water, with the re-formation of the preceding salt,\r\n       whilst iodic acid remains in solution--\r\n\r\n              4AgIO_{4} + H_{2}O = Ag_{4}I_{2}O_{9} + 2HIO_{4}.\r\n\r\n       The structure of the first of these salts,\r\n       Na_{4}I_{2}O_{9},3H_{2}O, presents itself in a simpler form if the\r\n       water of crystallisation is regarded as an integral portion of the\r\n       salt; the formula is then divided in two, and takes the form of\r\n       IO(OH)_{3}(ONa)_{2}--that is, it answers to the type IOX_{5}, or\r\n       IX_{7}, like AgIO_{4} which is IO_{3}(OAg). The composition of all\r\n       the salts of periodic acids are expressed by this type IX_{7}.\r\n       Kimmins (1889) refers all the salts of periodic acid to four\r\n       types--the meta-salts of HIO_{4} (salts of Ag, Cu, Pb), the\r\n       meso-salts of H_{3}IO_{5} (PbH, Ag_{2}H, CdH), the para-salts of\r\n       H_{5}IO_{6} (Na_{2}H_{3}, Na_{3}H_{2}), and the di-salts of\r\n       H_{4}I_{2}O_{9} (K_{4}, Ag_{4}, Ni_{2}). The three first are\r\n       direct compounds of the type IX_{7}, namely, IO_{3}(OH),\r\n       IO_{2}(OH)_{3}, and IO(OH)_{5}, and the last are types of\r\n       diperiodic salts, which correspond with the type of the\r\n       meso-salts, as pyrophosphoric salts correspond with\r\n       orthophosphoric salts--_i.e._ 2H_{3}IO_{5}-H_{2}O =\r\n       H_{4}I_{2}O_{9}.\r\n\r\n  [85] Periodic acid, discovered by Magnus and Ammermüller, and whose\r\n       salts were afterwards studied by Langlois, Rammelsberg, and many\r\n       others, presents an example of hydrates in which it is evident\r\n       that there is not that distinction between the water of hydration\r\n       and of crystallisation which was at first considered to be so\r\n       clear. In HClO,2H_{2}O the water, 2H_{2}O, is not displaced by\r\n       bases, and must be regarded as water of crystallisation, whilst in\r\n       HIO_{4},2H_{2}O it must be regarded as water of hydration. We\r\n       shall afterwards see that the system of the elements obliges us to\r\n       consider the halogens as substances giving a highest saline type,\r\n       _GX__{7}, where _G_ signifies a halogen, and _X_ oxygen (O =\r\n       _X__{2}), OH, and other like elements. The hydrate IO(OH)_{5}\r\n       corresponding with many of the salts of periodic acid (for\r\n       example, the salts of barium, strontium, mercury) does not exhaust\r\n       all the possible forms. It is evident that various other pyro-,\r\n       meta-, &c., forms are possible by the loss of water, as will be\r\n       more fully explained in speaking of phosphoric acid, and as was\r\n       pointed out in the preceding note.\r\n\r\nCompounds formed between chlorine and iodine must be classed among the\r\nmost interesting halogen bodies.[86] These elements combine together\r\ndirectly with evolution of heat, and form _iodine monochloride_, ICl, or\r\n_iodine trichloride_, ICl_{3}.[87] As water reacts on these substances,\r\nforming iodic acid and iodine, they have to be prepared from dry iodine\r\nand chlorine.[88] Both substances are formed in a number of reactions;\r\nfor example, by the action of aqua regia on iodine, of chlorine on\r\nhydriodic acid, of hydrochloric acid on periodic acid, of iodine on\r\npotassium chlorate (with the aid of heat, &c.) Trapp obtained iodine\r\nmonochloride, in beautiful red crystals, by passing a rapid current of\r\nchlorine into molten iodine. The monochloride then distils over and\r\nsolidifies, melting at 27°. By passing chlorine over the crystals of the\r\nmonochloride, it is easy to obtain iodine trichloride in orange crystals,\r\nwhich melt at 34° and volatilise at 47°, but in so doing decompose (into\r\nCl_{2} and ClI). The chemical properties of these chlorides entirely\r\nresemble those of chlorine and iodine, as would be expected, because, in\r\nthis instance, a combination of similar substances has taken place as in\r\nthe formation of solutions or alloys. Thus, for instance, the unsaturated\r\nhydrocarbons (for example, C_{2}H_{4}), which are capable of directly\r\ncombining with chlorine and iodine, also directly combine with iodine\r\nmonochloride.\r\n\r\n  [86] With respect to hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and other elements,\r\n       bromine occupies an intermediate position between chlorine and\r\n       iodine, and therefore there is no particular need for considering\r\n       at length the compounds of bromine. This is the great advantage of\r\n       a natural grouping of the elements.\r\n\r\n  [87] They were both obtained by Gay-Lussac and many others. Recent data\r\n       respecting iodine monochloride, ICl, entirely confirm the numerous\r\n       observations of Trapp (1854), and even confirm his statement as to\r\n       the existence of two isomeric (liquid and crystalline) forms\r\n       (Stortenbeker). With a small excess of iodine, iodine monochloride\r\n       remains liquid, but in the presence of traces of iodine\r\n       trichloride it easily crystallises. Tanatar (1893) showed that of\r\n       the two modifications of ICl, one is stable, and melts at 27°;\r\n       while the other, which easily passes into the first, and is formed\r\n       in the absence of ICl_{3}, melts at 14°. Schützenberger amplified\r\n       the data concerning the action of water on the chlorides (Note\r\n       88), and Christomanos gave the fullest data regarding the\r\n       trichloride.\r\n\r\n       After being kept for some time, the liquid monochloride of iodine\r\n       yields red deliquescent octahedra, having the composition ICl_{4},\r\n       which are therefore formed from the monochloride with the\r\n       liberation of free iodine, which dissolves in the remaining\r\n       quantity of the monochloride. This substance, however, judging by\r\n       certain observations, is impure iodine trichloride. If 1 part of\r\n       iodine be stirred up in 20 parts of water, and chlorine be passed\r\n       through the liquid, then all the iodine is dissolved, and a\r\n       colourless liquid is ultimately obtained which contains a certain\r\n       proportion of chlorine, because this compound gives a metallic\r\n       chloride and iodate with alkalis without evolving any free iodine:\r\n       ICl_{5} + 6KHO = 5KCl + KIO_{3} + 3H_{2}O. The existence of a\r\n       pentachloride ICl_{5} is, however, denied, because this substance\r\n       has not been obtained in a free state.\r\n\r\n       Stortenbeker (1888) investigated the equilibrium of the system\r\n       containing the molecules I_{2}, ICl, ICl_{3}, and Cl_{2}, in the\r\n       same way that Roozeboom (Chapter X. Note 38) examined the\r\n       equilibrium of the molecules HCl, HCl,2H_{2}O, and H_{2}O. He\r\n       found that iodine monochloride appears in two states, one (the\r\n       ordinary) is stable and melts at 27°·2, whilst the other is\r\n       obtained by rapid cooling, and melts at 13°·9, and easily passes\r\n       into the first form. Iodine trichloride melts at 101° only in a\r\n       closed tube under a pressure of 16 atmospheres.\r\n\r\n  [88] By the action of water on iodine monochloride and trichloride a\r\n       compound IHCl_{2} is obtained, which does not seem to be altered\r\n       by water. Besides this compound, iodine and iodic acid are always\r\n       formed, 10ICl + 3H_{2}O = HIO_{3} + 5IHCl_{2} + 2I_{2}; and in\r\n       this respect iodine trichloride may be regarded as a mixture, ICl\r\n       + ICl_{5} = 2ICl_{3}, but ICl_{5} + 3H_{2}O = IHO_{3} + 5HCl;\r\n       hence iodic acid, iodine, the compound IHCl_{2}, and hydrochloric\r\n       acid are also formed by the action of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTERR XII\r\n\r\n                                 SODIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neutral salt, sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, obtained when a mixture\r\nof sulphuric acid and common salt is strongly heated (Chapter X.),[1]\r\nforms a colourless saline mass consisting of fine crystals, soluble in\r\nwater. It is the product of many other double decompositions, sometimes\r\ncarried out on a large scale; for example, when ammonium sulphate is\r\nheated with common salt, in which case the sal-ammoniac is volatilised,\r\n&c. A similar decomposition also takes place when, for instance, a\r\nmixture of lead sulphate and common salt is heated; this mixture easily\r\nfuses, and if the temperature be further raised heavy vapours of lead\r\nchloride appear. When the disengagement of these vapours ceases, the\r\nremaining mass, on being treated with water, yields a solution of\r\nsodium sulphate mixed with a solution of undecomposed common salt. A\r\nconsiderable quantity, however, of the lead sulphate remains unchanged\r\nduring this reaction, PbSO_{4} + 2NaCl = PbCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4}, the\r\nvapours will contain lead chloride, and the residue will contain the\r\nmixture of the three remaining salts. The cause and nature of the\r\nreaction are just the same as were pointed out when considering the\r\naction of sulphuric acid upon NaCl. Here too it may be shown that the\r\ndouble decomposition is determined by the removal of PbCl_{2} from the\r\nsphere of the action of the remaining substances. This is seen from the\r\nfact that sodium sulphate, on being dissolved in water and mixed with a\r\nsolution of any lead salt (and even with a solution of lead chloride,\r\nalthough this latter is but sparingly soluble in water), immediately\r\ngives a white precipitate of lead sulphate. In this case the lead takes\r\nup the elements of sulphuric acid from the sodium sulphate in the\r\nsolutions. On heating, the reverse phenomenon is observed. The reaction\r\nin the solution depends upon the insolubility of the lead sulphate, and\r\nthe decomposition which takes place on heating is due to the volatility\r\nof the lead chloride. Silver sulphate, Ag_{2}SO_{4}, in solution with\r\ncommon salt, gives silver chloride, because the latter is insoluble in\r\nwater, Ag_{2}SO_{4} + 2NaCl = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2AgCl. Sodium carbonate,\r\nmixed in solution with the sulphates of iron, copper, manganese,\r\nmagnesium, &c., gives in solution sodium sulphate, and in the precipitate\r\na carbonate of the corresponding metal, because these salts of carbonic\r\nacid are insoluble in water; for instance, MgSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} =\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4} + MgCO_{3}. In precisely the same way sodium hydroxide acts\r\non solutions of the majority of the salts of sulphuric acid containing\r\nmetals, the hydroxides of which are insoluble in water--for instance,\r\nCuSO_{4} + 2NaHO = Cu(HO)_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4}. Sulphate of magnesium,\r\nMgSO_{4}, on being mixed in solution with common salt, forms, although\r\nnot completely, chloride of magnesium, and sodium sulphate. On cooling\r\nthe mixture of such (concentrated) solutions sodium sulphate is\r\ndeposited, as was shown in Chapter X. This is made use of for preparing\r\nit on the large scale in works where sea-water is treated. In this case,\r\non cooling, the reaction 2NaCl + MgSO_{4} = MgCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4} takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n  [1] Whilst describing in some detail the properties of sodium\r\n      chloride, hydrochloric acid, and sodium sulphate, I wish to impart,\r\n      by separate examples, an idea of the properties of saline\r\n      substances, but the dimensions of this work and its purpose and aim\r\n      do not permit of entering into particulars concerning every salt,\r\n      acid, or other substance. The fundamental object of this work--an\r\n      account of the characteristics of the elements and an acquaintance\r\n      with the forces acting between atoms--has nothing to gain from the\r\n      multiplication of the number of as yet ungeneralised properties and\r\n      relations.\r\n\r\nThus where sulphates and salts of sodium are in contact, it may be\r\nexpected that sodium sulphate will be formed and separated if the\r\nconditions are favourable; for this reason it is not surprising that\r\nsodium sulphate is often found in the native state. Some of the springs\r\nand salt lakes in the steppes beyond the Volga, and in the Caucasus,\r\ncontain a considerable quantity of sodium sulphate, and yield it by\r\nsimple evaporation of the solutions. Beds of this salt are also met with;\r\nthus at a depth of only 5 feet, about 38 versts to the east of Tiflis, at\r\nthe foot of the range of the 'Wolf's mane' (Voltchia griva) mountains, a\r\ndeep stratum of very pure Glauber's salt, Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O, has been\r\nfound.[2] A layer two metres thick of the same salt lies at the bottom of\r\nseveral lakes (an area of about 10 square kilometres) in the Kouban\r\ndistrict near Batalpaschinsk, and here its working has been commenced\r\n(1887). In Spain, near Arangoulz and in many parts of the Western States\r\nof North America, mineral sodium sulphate has likewise been found, and is\r\nalready being worked.\r\n\r\n  [2] Anhydrous (ignited) sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, is known in\r\n      trade as 'sulphate' or salt-cake, in mineralogy _thenardite_.\r\n      Crystalline decahydrated salt is termed in mineralogy _mirabilite_,\r\n      and in trade Glauber's salt. On fusing it, the monohydrate\r\n      Na_{2}SO_{4}H_{2}O is obtained, together with a supersaturated\r\n      solution.\r\n\r\nThe methods of obtaining salts by means of double decomposition from\r\nothers already prepared are so general, that in describing a given salt\r\nthere is no necessity to enumerate the cases hitherto observed of its\r\nbeing formed through various double decompositions.[3] The possibility\r\nof this occurrence ought to be foreseen according to Berthollet's\r\ndoctrine from the properties of the salt in question. On this account it\r\nis important to know the properties of salts; all the more so because\r\nup to the present time those very properties (solubility, formation\r\nof crystallo-hydrates, volatility, &c.) which may be made use of for\r\nseparating them from other salts have not been generalised.[4] These\r\nproperties as yet remain subjects for investigation, and are rarely\r\nto be foreseen. The crystallo-hydrate of the normal sodium sulphate,\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O, very easily parts with water, and may be obtained\r\nin an anhydrous state if it be carefully heated until the weight\r\nremains constant; but if heated further, it partly loses the elements\r\nof sulphuric anhydride. The normal salt fuses at 843° (red heat), and\r\nvolatilises to a slight extent when very strongly heated, in which\r\ncase it naturally decomposes with the evolution of SO_{3}. At 0° 100\r\nparts of water dissolve 5 parts of the anhydrous salt, at 10° 9 parts,\r\nat 20° 19·4, at 30° 40, and at 34° 55 parts, the same being the case\r\nin the presence of an excess of crystals of Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O.[5]\r\nAt 34° the latter fuses, and the solubility decreases at higher\r\ntemperatures.[6] A concentrated solution at 34° has a composition\r\nnearly approaching to Na_{2}SO_{4} + 14H_{2}O, and the decahydrated salt\r\ncontains 78·9 of the anhydrous salt combined with 100 parts of water.\r\nFrom the above figures it is seen that the decahydrated salt cannot\r\nfuse without decomposing,[7] like hydrate of chlorine, Cl_{2},8H_{2}O\r\n(Chapter XI., Note 10). Not only the fused decahydrated salt, but also\r\nthe concentrated solution at 34° (not all at once, but gradually),\r\nyields the monohydrated salt, Na_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O. The heptahydrated\r\nsalt, Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O, also splits up, even at low temperatures,\r\nwith the formation of this monohydrated salt, and therefore from 35°\r\nthe solubility can be given only for the latter. For 100 parts of water\r\nthis is as follows: at 40° 48·8, at 50° 46·7, at 80° 43·7, at 100°\r\n42·5 parts of the anhydrous salt. If the decahydrated salt be fused,\r\nand the solution allowed to cool in the presence of the monohydrated\r\nsalt, then at 30° 50·4 parts of anhydrous salt are retained in the\r\nsolution, and at 20° 52·8 parts. Hence, with respect to the anhydrous\r\nand monohydrated salts, the solubility is identical, and falls with\r\nincreasing temperature, whilst with respect to decahydrated salt, the\r\nsolubility rises with increasing temperature. So that if in contact\r\nwith a solution of sodium sulphate there are only crystals of that\r\nheptahydrated salt (Chapter I., Note 54), Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O, which\r\nis formed from saturated solutions, then saturation sets in when the\r\nsolution has the following composition per 100 parts of salt: at 0°\r\n19·6, at 10° 30·5, at 20° 44·7, and at 25° 52·9 parts of anhydrous\r\nsalt. Above 27° the heptahydrated salt, like the decahydrated\r\nsalt at 34°, splits up into the monohydrated salt and a saturated\r\nsolution. Thus sodium sulphate has three curves of solubility: one for\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O (from 0° to 26°), one for Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O\r\n(from 0° to 34°), and one for Na_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O (a descending curve\r\nbeginning at 26°), because there are three of these crystallo-hydrates,\r\nand the solubility of a substance only depends upon the particular\r\ncondition of that portion of it which has separated from the solution or\r\nis present in excess.[8]\r\n\r\n  [3] The salts may be obtained not only by methods of substitution of\r\n      various kinds, but also by many other combinations. Thus sodium\r\n      sulphate may be formed from sodium oxide and sulphuric anhydride,\r\n      by oxidising sodium sulphide, Na_{2}S, or sodium sulphite,\r\n      Na_{2}SO_{3}, &c. When sodium chloride is heated in a mixture of\r\n      the vapours of water, air, and sulphurous anhydride, sodium\r\n      sulphate is formed. According to this method (patented by\r\n      Hargreaves and Robinson), sodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, is\r\n      obtained from NaCl without the preliminary manufacture of\r\n      H_{2}SO_{4}. Lumps of NaCl pressed into bricks are loosely packed\r\n      into a cylinder and subjected, at a red heat, to the action of\r\n      steam, air and SO_{2}. Under these conditions, HCl, sulphate, and a\r\n      certain amount of unaltered NaCl are obtained. This mixture is\r\n      converted into soda by Gossage's process (_see_ Note 15) and may\r\n      have some practical value.\r\n\r\n  [4] Many observations have been made, but little general information\r\n      has been obtained from particular cases. In addition to which, the\r\n      properties of a given salt are changed by the presence of other\r\n      salts. This takes place not only in virtue of mutual decomposition\r\n      or formation of double salts capable of separate existence, but is\r\n      determined by the influence which some salts exert on others, or by\r\n      forces similar to those which act during solution. Here nothing has\r\n      been generalised to that extent which would render it possible to\r\n      predict without previous investigation, if there be no close\r\n      analogy to help us. Let us state one of these numerous cases: 100\r\n      parts of water at 20° dissolve 34 parts of potassium nitrate but on\r\n      the addition of sodium nitrate the solubility of potassium nitrate\r\n      increases to 48 parts in 10 of water (Carnelley and Thomson). In\r\n      general, in all cases of which there are accurate observations it\r\n      appears that the presence of foreign salts changes the properties\r\n      of any given salt.\r\n\r\n  [5] The information concerning solubility (Chapter I.) is given\r\n      according to the determinations of Gay-Lussac, Lovell, and Mulder.\r\n\r\n  [6] In Chapter I., Note 24, we have already seen that with many other\r\n      sulphates the solubility also decreases after a certain temperature\r\n      is passed. Gypsum, CaSO_{4},2H_{2}O, lime, and many other compounds\r\n      present such a phenomenon. An observation of Tilden's (1884) is\r\n      most instructive; he showed that on raising the temperature (in\r\n      closed vessels) above 140° the solubility of sodium sulphate again\r\n      begins to increase. At 100° 100 parts of water dissolve about 43\r\n      parts of anhydrous salt, at 140° 42 parts, at 160° 43 parts, at\r\n      180° 44 parts, at 230° 46 parts. According to Étard (1892) the\r\n      solubility of 30 parts of Na{2}SO_{4} in 100 of solution (or 43 per\r\n      100 of water) corresponds to 80°, and above 240° the solubility\r\n      again falls, and very rapidly, so that at 320° the solution\r\n      contains 12 per 100 of solution (about 14 per 100 of water) and a\r\n      further rise of temperature is followed by a further deposition of\r\n      the salt. It is evident that the phenomenon of saturation,\r\n      determined by the presence of an excess of the dissolved substance,\r\n      is very complex, and therefore that for the theory of solutions\r\n      considered as liquid indefinite chemical compounds, many useful\r\n      statements can hardly be given.\r\n\r\n  [7] Already referred to in Chapter I., Note 56.\r\n\r\n      The example of sodium sulphate is historically very important for\r\n      the theory of solutions. Notwithstanding the number of\r\n      investigations which have been made, it is still insufficiently\r\n      studied, especially from the point of the vapour tension of\r\n      solutions and crystallo-hydrates, so that those processes cannot be\r\n      applied to it which Guldberg, Roozeboom, Van't Hoff, and others\r\n      applied to solutions and crystallo-hydrates. It would also be most\r\n      important to investigate the influence of pressure on the various\r\n      phenomena corresponding with the combinations of water and sodium\r\n      sulphate, because when crystals are separated--for instance, of the\r\n      decahydrated salt--an increase of volume takes place, as can be\r\n      seen from the following data:--the sp. gr. of the anhydrous salt is\r\n      2·66, that of the decahydrated salt = 1·46, but the sp. gr. of\r\n      solutions at 15°/4° = 9,992 + 90·2_p_ + 0·35_p_^2 where p\r\n      represents the percentage of anhydrous salt in the solution, and\r\n      the sp. gr. of water at 4° = 10,000. Hence for solutions containing\r\n      20 p.c. of anhydrous salt the sp. gr. = 1·1936; therefore the\r\n      volume of 100 grams of this solution = 83·8 c.c., and the volume of\r\n      anhydrous salt contained in it is equal to 20/2·66, or = 7·5 c.c.,\r\n      and the volume of water = 80·1 c.c. Therefore, the solution, on\r\n      decomposing into anhydrous salt and water, increases in volume\r\n      (from 83·8 to 87·6); but in the same way 83·8 c.c. of 20 p.c.\r\n      solution are formed from (45·4/1·46 =) 31·1 c.c. of the\r\n      decahydrated salt, and 54·6 c.c. of water--that is to say, that\r\n      during the formation of a solution from 85·7 c.c., 83·8 c.c. are\r\n      formed.\r\n\r\n  [8] From this example it is evident the solution remains unaltered\r\n      until from the contact of a solid it becomes either saturated or\r\n      supersaturated, crystallisation being determined by the attraction\r\n      to a solid, as the phenomenon of supersaturation clearly\r\n      demonstrates. This partially explains certain apparently\r\n      contradictory determinations of solubility. The best investigated\r\n      example of such complex relations is cited in Chapter XIV., Note 50\r\n      (for CaCl_{2}).\r\n\r\nThus solutions of sodium sulphate may give crystallo-hydrates of three\r\nkinds on cooling the saturated solution: the unstable heptahydrated salt\r\nis obtained at temperatures below 26°, the decahydrated salt forms under\r\nordinary conditions at temperatures below 34°, and the monohydrated salt\r\nat temperatures above 34°. Both the latter crystallo-hydrates present a\r\nstable state of equilibrium, and the heptahydrated salt decomposes into\r\nthem, probably according to the equation 3Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}0 =\r\n2Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O + Na_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O. The ordinary decahydrated\r\nsalt is called _Glauber's salt_. All forms of these crystallo-hydrates\r\nlose their water entirely, and give the anhydrous salt when dried over\r\nsulphuric acid.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] According to Pickering's experiments (1886), the molecular weight\r\n      in grams (that is, 142 grams) of anhydrous sodium sulphate, on\r\n      being dissolved in a large mass of water, at 0° absorbs (hence\r\n      the-sign)-1,100 heat units, at 10°-700, at 15°-275, at 20° gives\r\n      out +25, at 25° +300 calories. For the decahydrated salt,\r\n      Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O, 5°-4,225, 10°-4,000, 15°-3,570, 20°-3,160,\r\n      25°-2,775. Hence (just as in Chapter I., Note 56) the heat of the\r\n      combination Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O at 5° = +3,125, 10° = +3,250, 20°\r\n      = +3,200, and 25° = +3,050.\r\n\r\n      It is evident that the decahydrated salt dissolving in water gives\r\n      a decrease of temperature. Solutions in hydrochloric acid give a\r\n      still greater decrease, because they contain the water of\r\n      crystallisation in a solid state--that is, like ice--and this on\r\n      melting absorbs heat. A mixture of 15 parts of\r\n      Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O and 12 parts of strong hydrochloric acid\r\n      produces sufficient cold to freeze water. During the treatment with\r\n      hydrochloric acid a certain quantity of sodium chloride is formed.\r\n\r\nSodium sulphate, Na_{2}SO_{4}, only enters into a few reactions of\r\ncombination with other salts, and chiefly with salts of the same acid,\r\nforming double sulphates. Thus, for example, if a solution of sodium\r\nsulphate be mixed with a solution of aluminium, magnesium, or ferrous\r\nsulphate, it gives crystals of a double salt when evaporated. Sulphuric\r\nacid itself forms a compound with sodium sulphate, which is exactly\r\nlike these double salts. It is formed with great ease when sodium\r\nsulphate is dissolved in sulphuric acid and the solution evaporated.\r\nOn evaporation, crystals of the acid salt separate, Na_{2}SO_{4} +\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} = 2NaHSO_{4}. This separates from hot solutions, whilst the\r\ncrystallo-hydrate, NaHSO_{4},H_{2}O,[10] separates from cold solutions.\r\nThe crystals when exposed to damp air decompose into H_{2}SO_{4}, which\r\ndeliquesces, and Na_{2}SO_{4} (Graham, Rose); alcohol also extracts\r\nsulphuric acid from the acid salt. This shows the feeble force which\r\nholds the sulphuric acid to the sodium sulphate.[11] Both acid sodium\r\nsulphate and all mixtures of the normal salt and sulphuric acid lose\r\nwater when heated, and are converted into sodium _pyrosulphate_,\r\nNa_{2}S_{2}O_{7}, at a low red heat.[11 bis] This anhydrous salt, at a\r\nbright red heat, parts with the elements of sulphuric anhydride, the\r\nnormal sodium sulphate remaining behind--Na_{2}S_{2}O_{7} = Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n+ SO_{3}. From this it is seen that the normal salt is able to combine\r\nwith water, with other sulphates, and with sulphuric anhydride or\r\nacid, &c.\r\n\r\n  [10] The very large and well-formed crystals of this salt resemble the\r\n       hydrate H_{2}SO_{4},H_{2}O, or SO(OH)_{4}. In general the\r\n       replacement of hydrogen by sodium modifies many of the properties\r\n       of acids less than its replacement by other metals. This most\r\n       probably depends on the volumes being nearly equal.\r\n\r\n  [11] In solution (Berthelot) the acid salt in all probability\r\n       decomposes most in the greatest mass of water. The specific\r\n       gravity (according to the determinations of Marignac) of solutions\r\n       at 15°/4° = 9,992 + 77·92_p_ + 0·231_p_^2 (_see_ Note 7). From\r\n       these figures, and from the specific gravities of sulphuric acid,\r\n       it is evident that on mixing solutions of this acid and sodium\r\n       sulphate _expansion_ will always take place; for instance,\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4} + 25H_{2}O with Na_{2}SO_{4} + 25H_{2}O increases from\r\n       483 volumes to 486. In addition to which, in weak solutions heat\r\n       is absorbed, as shown in Chapter X., Note 27. Nevertheless, even\r\n       more acid salts may be formed and obtained in a crystalline form.\r\n       For instance, on cooling a solution of 1 part of sodium sulphate\r\n       in 7 parts of sulphuric acid, crystals of the composition\r\n       NaHSO_{4},H_{2}SO_{4} are separated (Schultz, 1868). This compound\r\n       fuses at about 100°; the ordinary acid salt, NaHSO_{4}, at 149°.\r\n\r\n  [11 bis] On decreasing the pressure, sodium hydrogen sulphate,\r\n       NaHSO_{4}, dissociates much more easily than at the ordinary\r\n       pressure; it loses water and forms the pyrosulphate,\r\n       Na_{2}S_{2}O_{7}; this reaction is utilised in chemical works.\r\n\r\nSodium sulphate may by double decomposition be converted into a sodium\r\nsalt of any other acid, by means of heat and taking advantage of the\r\nvolatility, or by means of solution and taking advantage of the different\r\ndegree of solubility of the different salts. Thus, for instance, owing to\r\nthe insolubility of barium sulphate, sodium hydroxide or caustic soda may\r\nbe prepared from sodium sulphate, if barium hydroxide be added to its\r\nsolution, Na_{2}SO_{4} + Ba(HO)_{2} = BaSO_{4} + 2NaHO. And by taking any\r\nsalt of barium, BaX_{2}, the corresponding salt of sodium may be\r\nobtained, Na_{2}SO_{4} + BaX_{2} = BaSO_{4} + 2NaX. Barium sulphate thus\r\nformed, being a very sparingly-soluble salt, is obtained as a\r\nprecipitate, whilst the sodium hydroxide, or salt, NaX, is obtained in\r\nsolution, because _all salts of sodium are soluble_. Berthollet's\r\ndoctrine permits all such cases to be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of _decomposition_ of sodium sulphate are above all\r\nnoticeable by the separation of oxygen. Sodium sulphate by itself\r\nis very stable, and it is only at a temperature sufficient to melt\r\niron that it is possible to separate the elements SO_{3} from it, and\r\nthen only partially. However, the oxygen may be separated from sodium\r\nsulphate, as from all other sulphates, by means of many substances\r\nwhich are able to combine with oxygen, such as charcoal and sulphur,\r\nbut hydrogen is not able to produce this action. If sodium sulphate be\r\nheated with charcoal, then carbonic oxide and anhydride are evolved,\r\nand there is produced, according to the circumstances, either the\r\nlower oxygen compound, sodium sulphite, Na_{2}SO_{3} (for instance, in\r\nthe formation of glass); or else the decomposition proceeds further,\r\nand sodium sulphide, Na_{2}S, is formed, according to the equation\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4} + 2C = 2CO_{2} + Na_{2}S.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this reaction the greater part of the sulphate of sodium\r\nprepared at chemical works is converted into _soda ash_--that is,\r\n_sodium carbonate_, Na_{2}CO_{3}, which is used for many purposes. In\r\nthe form of carbonates, the metallic oxides behave in many cases just\r\nas they do in the state of oxides or hydroxides, owing to the feeble\r\nacid properties of carbonic acid. However, the majority of the salts of\r\ncarbonic acid are insoluble, whilst sodium carbonate is one of the few\r\nsoluble salts of this acid, and therefore reacts with facility. Hence\r\nsodium carbonate is employed for many purposes, in which its alkaline\r\nproperties come into play. Thus, even under the action of feeble organic\r\nacids it immediately parts with its carbonic acid, and gives a sodium\r\nsalt of the acid taken. Its solutions exhibit an alkaline reaction on\r\nlitmus. It aids the passage of certain organic substances (tar, acids)\r\ninto solution, and is therefore used, like caustic alkalis and soap\r\n(which latter also acts by virtue of the alkali it contains), for the\r\nremoval of certain organic substances, especially in bleaching cotton\r\nand similar fabrics. Besides which a considerable quantity of sodium\r\ncarbonate is used for the preparation of sodium hydroxide or caustic\r\nsoda, which has also a very wide application. In large chemical works\r\nwhere sodium carbonate is manufactured from Na_{2}SO_{4}, it is usual\r\nfirst to manufacture sulphuric acid, and then by its aid to convert\r\ncommon salt into sodium sulphate, and lastly to convert the sodium\r\nsulphate thus obtained into carbonate and caustic soda. Hence these\r\nworks prepare both alkaline substances (soda ash and caustic soda) and\r\nacid substances (sulphuric and hydrochloric acids), the two classes of\r\nchemical products which are distinguished for the greatest energy of\r\ntheir reactions and are therefore most frequently applied to technical\r\npurposes. Factories manufacturing soda are generally called alkali works.\r\n\r\nThe process of the conversion of sodium sulphate into sodium carbonate\r\nconsists in strongly heating a mixture of the sulphate with charcoal\r\nand calcium carbonate. The following reactions then take place: the\r\nsodium sulphate is first deoxidised by the charcoal, forming sodium\r\nsulphide and carbonic anhydride, Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2C = Na_{2}S + 2CO_{2}.\r\nThe sodium sulphide thus formed then enters into double decomposition\r\nwith the calcium carbonate taken, and gives calcium sulphide and sodium\r\ncarbonate, Na_{2}S + CaCO_{3} = Na_{2}CO_{3} + CaS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Reverberatory furnace for the manufacture\r\nof sodium carbonate.

At the end of the\r\noperation the semifused mass is charged into trucks C.]\r\n\r\nBesides which, under the action of the heat, a portion of the excess\r\nof calcium carbonate is decomposed into lime and carbonic anhydride,\r\nCaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}, and the carbonic anhydride with the excess\r\nof charcoal forms carbon monoxide, which towards the end of the\r\noperation shows itself by the appearance of a blue flame. Thus from a\r\nmass containing sodium sulphate we obtain a mass which includes sodium\r\ncarbonate, calcium sulphide, and calcium oxide, but none of the sodium\r\nsulphide which was formed on first heating the mixture. The entire\r\nprocess, which proceeds at a high temperature, may be expressed by a\r\ncombination of the three above-mentioned formulæ, if it be considered\r\nthat the product contains one equivalent of calcium oxide to two\r\nequivalents of calcium sulphide.[12] The sum of the reactions may then\r\nbe expressed thus: 2Na_{2}SO_{4} + 3CaCO_{3} + 9C = 2Na_{2}CO_{3} +\r\nCaO,2CaS + 10CO. Indeed, the quantities in which the substances are\r\nmixed together at chemical works approaches to the proportion required\r\nby this equation. The entire process of decomposition is carried on\r\nin reverberatory furnaces, into which a mixture of 1,000 parts of\r\nsodium sulphate, 1,040 parts of calcium carbonate (as a somewhat porous\r\nlimestone), and 500 parts of small coal is introduced from above.\r\nThis mixture is first heated in the portion of the furnace which is\r\nfurthest removed from the fire-grate; it is then brought to the portion\r\nnearest to the fire-grate, when it is stirred during heating. The\r\npartially fused mass obtained at the end of the process is cooled, and\r\nthen subjected to methodical lixiviation[13] to extract the sodium\r\ncarbonate, the mixture of calcium oxide and sulphide forming the\r\nso-called 'soda waste' or 'alkali waste.'[14]\r\n\r\n  [12] Calcium sulphide, CaS, like many metallic sulphides which are\r\n       soluble in water, is decomposed by it (Chapter X.), CaS + H_{2}O =\r\n       CaO + H_{2}S, because hydrogen sulphide is a very feeble acid. If\r\n       calcium sulphide be acted on by a large mass of water, lime may be\r\n       precipitated, and a state of equilibrium will be reached, when the\r\n       system CaO + 2CaS remains unchanged. Lime, being a product of the\r\n       action of water on CaS, limits this action. Therefore, if in black\r\n       ash the lime were not in excess, a part of the sulphide would be\r\n       in solution (actually there is but very little). In this manner in\r\n       the manufacture of sodium carbonate the conditions of equilibrium\r\n       which enter into double decompositions have been made use of (_see\r\n       above_), and the aim is to form directly the unchangeable product\r\n       CaO,2CaS. This was first regarded as a special insoluble compound,\r\n       but there is no evidence of its independent existence.\r\n\r\n  [13] [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Apparatus for the methodical lixiviation\r\n       of black ash, &c. Water flows into the tanks from the pipes _r_,\r\n       _r_, and the saturated liquid is drawn off from _c_, _c_.]\r\n\r\n       _Methodical lixiviation_ is the extraction, by means of water, of\r\n       a soluble substance from the mass containing it. It is carried on\r\n       so as not to obtain weak aqueous solutions, and in such a way that\r\n       the residue shall not contain any of the soluble substance. This\r\n       problem is practically of great importance in many industries. It\r\n       is required to extract from the mass all that is soluble in water.\r\n       This is easily effected if water be first poured on the mass, the\r\n       strong solution thus obtained decanted, then water again poured\r\n       on, time being allowed for it to act, then again decanted, and so\r\n       on until fresh water does not take up anything. But then finally\r\n       such weak solutions are obtained that it would be very\r\n       disadvantageous to evaporate them. This is avoided by pouring the\r\n       fresh hot water destined for the lixiviation, not onto the fresh\r\n       mass, but upon a mass which has already been subjected to a first\r\n       lixiviation by weak solutions. In this way the fresh water gives a\r\n       weak solution. The strong solution which goes to the evaporating\r\n       pan flows from those parts of the apparatus which contain the\r\n       fresh, as yet unlixiviated, mass, and thus in the latter parts the\r\n       weak alkali formed in the other parts of the apparatus becomes\r\n       saturated as far as possible with the soluble substance. Generally\r\n       several intercommunicating vessels are constructed (standing at\r\n       the same level) into which in turn the fresh mass is charged which\r\n       is intended for lixiviation; the water is poured in, the alkali\r\n       drawn off, and the lixiviated residue removed. The illustration\r\n       represents such an apparatus, consisting of four communicating\r\n       vessels. The water poured into one of them flows through the two\r\n       nearest and issues from the third. The fresh mass being placed in\r\n       one of these boxes or vessels, the stream of water passing through\r\n       the apparatus is directed in such a manner as to finally issue\r\n       from this vessel containing the fresh unlixiviated mass. The fresh\r\n       water is added to the vessel containing the material which has\r\n       been almost completely exhausted. Passing through this vessel it\r\n       is conveyed by the pipe (syphon passing from the bottom of the\r\n       first box to the top of the second) communicating with the second;\r\n       it finally passes (also through a syphon pipe) into the box (the\r\n       third) containing the fresh material. The water will extract all\r\n       that is soluble in the first vessel, leaving only an insoluble\r\n       residue. This vessel is then ready to be emptied, and refilled\r\n       with fresh material. The levels of the liquids in the various\r\n       vessels will naturally be different, in consequence of the various\r\n       strengths of the solutions which they contain.\r\n\r\n       It must not, however, be thought that sodium carbonate alone\r\n       passes into the solution; there is also a good deal of caustic\r\n       soda with it, formed by the action of lime on the carbonate of\r\n       sodium, and there are also certain sodium sulphur compounds with\r\n       which we shall partly become acquainted hereafter. The sodium\r\n       carbonate, therefore, is not obtained in a very pure state. The\r\n       solution is concentrated by evaporation. This is conducted by\r\n       means of the waste heat from the soda furnaces, together with that\r\n       of the gases given off. The process in the soda furnaces can only\r\n       be carried on at a high temperature, and therefore the smoke and\r\n       gases issuing from them are necessarily very hot. If the heat they\r\n       contain was not made use of there would be a great waste of fuel;\r\n       consequently in immediate proximity to these furnaces there is\r\n       generally a series of pans or evaporating boilers, under which the\r\n       gases pass, and into which the alkali solution is poured. On\r\n       evaporating the solution, first of all the undecomposed sodium\r\n       sulphate separates, then the sodium carbonate or soda crystals.\r\n       These crystals as they separate are raked out and placed on\r\n       planks, where the liquid drains away from them. Caustic soda\r\n       remains in the residue, and also any sodium chloride which was not\r\n       decomposed in the foregoing process.\r\n\r\n       Part of the sodium carbonate is recrystallised in order to purify\r\n       it more thoroughly. In order to do this a saturated solution is\r\n       left to crystallise at a temperature below 30° in a current of\r\n       air, in order to promote the separation of the water vapour. The\r\n       large transparent crystals (efflorescent in air) of\r\n       Na_{2}CO_{3},10H_{2}O are then formed which have already been\r\n       spoken of (Chapter I.).\r\n\r\n  [14] The whole of the sulphur used in the production of the sulphuric\r\n       acid employed in decomposing the common salt is contained in this\r\n       residue. This is the great burden and expense of the soda works\r\n       which use Leblanc's method. As an instructive example from a\r\n       chemical point of view, it is worth while mentioning here two of\r\n       the various methods of recovering the sulphur from the soda waste.\r\n       Chance's process is treated in Chapter XX., Note 6.\r\n\r\n       Kynaston (1885) treats the soda waste with a solution (sp. gr.\r\n       l·21) of magnesium chloride, which disengages sulphuretted\r\n       hydrogen: CaS + MgCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O = CaCl_{2} + Mg(OH)_{2} +\r\n       H_{2}S. Sulphurous anhydride is passed through the residue in\r\n       order to form the insoluble calcium sulphite: CaCl_{2} +\r\n       Mg(OH)_{2} + SO_{2} = CaSO_{3} + MgCl_{2} + H_{2}O. The solution\r\n       of magnesium chloride obtained is again used, and the washed\r\n       calcium sulphite is brought into contact at a low temperature with\r\n       hydrochloric acid (a weak aqueous solution) and hydrogen sulphide,\r\n       the whole of the sulphur then separating:\r\n\r\n          CaSO_{3} + 2H_{2}S + 2HCl = CaCl_{2} + 3H_{2}O + 3S.\r\n\r\n       But most efforts have been directed towards avoiding the formation\r\n       of soda waste.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned process for making soda was discovered in the year\r\n1808 by the French doctor Leblanc, and is known as the Leblanc process.\r\nThe particulars of the discovery are somewhat remarkable. Sodium\r\ncarbonate, having a considerable application in industry, was for a\r\nlong time prepared exclusively from the ash of marine plants (Chapter\r\nXI., page 497). Even up to the present time this process is carried on\r\nin Normandy. In France, where for a long time the manufacture of large\r\nquantities of soap (so-called Marseilles soap) and various fabrics\r\nrequired a large amount of soda, the quantity prepared at the coast was\r\ninsufficient to meet the demand. For this reason during the wars at the\r\nbeginning of the century, when the import of foreign goods into France\r\nwas interdicted, the want of sodium carbonate was felt. The French\r\nAcademy offered a prize for the discovery of a profitable method of\r\npreparing it from common salt. Leblanc then proposed the above-mentioned\r\nprocess, which is remarkable for its great simplicity.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] Among the drawbacks of the Leblanc process are the accumulation of\r\n       'soda waste' (Note 14) owing to the impossibility at the\r\n       comparatively low price of sulphur (especially in the form of\r\n       pyrites) of finding employment for the sulphur and sulphur\r\n       compounds for which this waste is sometimes treated, and also the\r\n       insufficient purity of the sodium carbonate for many purposes. The\r\n       advantages of the Leblanc process, besides its simplicity and\r\n       cheapness, are that almost the whole of the acids obtained as\r\n       bye-products have a commercial value; for chlorine and bleaching\r\n       powder are produced from the large amount of hydrochloric acid\r\n       which appears as a bye-product; caustic soda also is very easily\r\n       made, and the demand for it increases every year. In those places\r\n       where salt, pyrites, charcoal, and limestone (the materials\r\n       required for alkali works) are found side by side--as, for\r\n       instance, in the Ural or Don districts--conditions are favourable\r\n       to the development of the manufacture of sodium carbonate on an\r\n       enormous scale; and where, as in the Caucasus, sodium sulphate\r\n       occurs naturally, the conditions are still more favourable. A\r\n       large amount, however, of the latter salt, even from soda works,\r\n       is used in making glass. The most important soda works, as regards\r\n       the quantity of products obtained from them, are the English\r\n       works.\r\n\r\n       As an example of the other numerous and varied methods of\r\n       manufacturing soda from sodium chloride, the following may be\r\n       mentioned: Sodium chloride is decomposed by oxide of lead, PbO,\r\n       forming lead chloride and sodium oxide, which, with carbonic\r\n       anhydride, yields sodium carbonate (Scheele's process). In Cornu's\r\n       method sodium chloride is treated with lime, and then exposed to\r\n       the air, when it yields a small quantity of sodium carbonate. In\r\n       E. Kopp's process sodium sulphate (125 parts) is mixed with oxide\r\n       of iron (80 parts) and charcoal (55 parts), and the mixture is\r\n       heated in reverberatory furnaces. Here a compound,\r\n       Na_{6}Fe_{4}S_{3}, is formed, which is insoluble in water absorbs\r\n       oxygen and carbonic anhydride, and then forms sodium carbonate and\r\n       ferrous sulphide; this when roasted gives sulphurous anhydride,\r\n       the indispensable material for the manufacture of sulphuric acid,\r\n       and ferric oxide which is again used in the process. In Grant's\r\n       method sodium sulphate is transformed into sodium sulphide, and\r\n       the latter is decomposed by a stream of carbonic anhydride and\r\n       steam, when hydrogen sulphide is disengaged and sodium carbonate\r\n       formed. Gossage prepares Na_{2}S from Na_{2}SO_{4} (by heating it\r\n       with carbon), dissolves it in water and subjects the solution to\r\n       the action of an excess of CO_{2} in coke towers, thus obtaining\r\n       H_{2}S (a gas which gives SO_{2} under perfect combustion, or\r\n       sulphur when incompletely burnt, Chapter XX., Note 6) and\r\n       bicarbonate of sodium; Na_{2}S + 2CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O = H_{2}S +\r\n       2HNaCO_{3}. The latter gives soda and CO_{2} when ignited. This\r\n       process quite eliminates the formation of soda-waste (_see_ Note\r\n       3) and should in my opinion be suitable for the treatment of\r\n       native Na_{2}SO_{4}, like that which is found in the Caucasus, all\r\n       the more since H_{2}S gives sulphur as a bye-product.\r\n\r\n       Repeated efforts have been made in recent times to obtain soda\r\n       (and chlorine, _see_ Chapter II., Note 1) from strong solutions of\r\n       salt (Chapter X., Note 23 bis) by the action of an electric\r\n       current, but until now these methods have not been worked out\r\n       sufficiently for practical use, probably partly owing to the\r\n       complicated apparatus needed, and the fact that the chlorine given\r\n       off at the anode corrodes the electrodes and vessels and has but a\r\n       limited industrial application. We may mention that according to\r\n       Hempel (1890) soda in crystals is deposited when an electric\r\n       current and a stream of carbonic acid gas are passed through a\r\n       saturated solution of NaCl.\r\n\r\n       Sodium carbonate may likewise be obtained from cryolite (Chapter\r\n       XVII., Note 23) the method of treating this will be mentioned\r\n       under Aluminium.\r\n\r\nOf all other industrial processes for manufacturing sodium carbonate,\r\nthe _ammonia process_ is the most worthy of mention.[16] In this the\r\nvapours of ammonia, and then an excess of carbonic anhydride, are\r\ndirectly introduced into a concentrated solution of sodium chloride\r\nin order to form the acid ammonium carbonate, NH_{4}HCO_{3}. Then, by\r\nmeans of the double saline decomposition of this salt, sodium chloride\r\nis decomposed, and in virtue of its slight solubility acid sodium\r\ncarbonate, NaHCO_{3}, is precipitated and ammonium chloride, NH_{4}Cl,\r\nis obtained in solution (with a portion of the sodium chloride and acid\r\nsodium carbonate). The reaction proceeds in the solution owing to the\r\nsparing solubility of the NaHCO_{3} according to the equation NaCl +\r\nNH_{4}HCO_{3} = NH_{4}Cl + NaHCO_{3}. The ammonia is recovered from the\r\nsolution by heating with lime or magnesia,[16 bis] and the precipitated\r\nacid sodium carbonate is converted into the normal salt by heating. It\r\nis thus obtained in a very pure state.[17]\r\n\r\n  [16] This process (Chapter XVII.) was first pointed out by Turck,\r\n       worked out by Schloesing, and finally applied industrially by\r\n       Solvay. The first (1883) large soda factories erected in Russia\r\n       for working this process are on the banks of the Kama at\r\n       Berezniak, near Ousolia, and belong to Lubimoff. But Russia, which\r\n       still imports from abroad a large quantity of bleaching powder and\r\n       exports a large amount of manganese ore, most of all requires\r\n       works carrying on the Leblanc process. In 1890 a factory of this\r\n       kind was erected by P. K. Oushkoff, on the Kama, near Elagoubi.\r\n\r\n  [16 bis] Mond (_see_ Chapter XI., Note 3 bis) separates the NH_{4}Cl\r\n       from the residual solutions by cooling (Chapter X., Note 44);\r\n       ignites the sal-ammoniac and passes the vapour over MgO, and so\r\n       re-obtains the NH_{3}, and forms MgCl_{2}: the former goes back\r\n       for the manufacture of soda, while the latter is employed either\r\n       for making HCl or Cl_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [17] Commercial soda ash (calcined, anhydrous) is rarely pure; the\r\n       crystallised soda is generally purer. In order to purify it\r\n       further, it is best to boil a concentrated solution of soda ash\r\n       until two-thirds of the liquid remain, collect the soda which\r\n       settles, wash with cold water, and then shake up with a strong\r\n       solution of ammonia, pour off the residue, and heat. The\r\n       impurities will then remain in the mother liquors, &c.\r\n\r\n       Some numerical data may be given for sodium carbonate. The\r\n       specific gravity of the anhydrous salt is 2·48, that of the\r\n       decahydrated salt 1·46. Two varieties are known of the\r\n       heptahydrated salt (Löwel, Marignac, Rammelsberg), which are\r\n       formed together by allowing a saturated solution to cool under a\r\n       layer of alcohol; the one is less stable (like the corresponding\r\n       sulphate) and at 0° has a solubility of 32 parts (of anhydrous\r\n       salt) in 100 water; the other is more stable, and its solubility\r\n       20 parts (of anhydrous salt) per 100 of water. The solubility of\r\n       the decahydrated salt in 100 water = at 0°, 7·0; at 20°, 21·7; at\r\n       30°, 37·2 parts (of anhydrous salt). At 80° the solubility is only\r\n       46·1, at 90° 45·7, at 100°, 45·4 parts (of anhydrous salt). That\r\n       is, it falls as the temperature rises, like Na_{2}SO_{4}. The\r\n       specific gravity (Note 7) of the solutions of sodium carbonate,\r\n       according to the data of Gerlach and Kohlrausch, at 15°/4° is\r\n       expressed by the formula, _s_ = 9,992 + 104·5_p_ + 0·165_p_^2.\r\n       Weak solutions occupy a volume not only less than the sum of the\r\n       volumes of the anhydrous salt and the water, but even less than\r\n       the water contained in them. For instance, 1,000 grams of a 1 p.c.\r\n       solution occupy (at 15°) a volume of 990·4 c.c. (sp. gr. 1·0097),\r\n       but contain 990 grams of water, occupying at 15° a volume of 990·8\r\n       c.c. A similar case, which is comparatively rare occurs also with\r\n       sodium hydroxide, in those dilute solutions for which the factor\r\n       _A_ is greater than 100 if the sp. gr. of water at 4° = 100,000,\r\n       and if the sp. gr. of the solution be expressed by the formula _S_\r\n       = _S__{0} + _Ap_ + _Bp_^2, where _S__{0} is the specific gravity\r\n       of the water. For 5 p.c. the sp. gr. 15°/4° = 1·0520; for 10 p.c.\r\n       1·1057; for 15 p.c. 1·1603. The changes in the sp. gr. with the\r\n       temperature are here almost the same as with solutions of sodium\r\n       chloride with an equal value of _p_.\r\n\r\nSodium carbonate, like sodium sulphate, loses all its water on being\r\nheated, and when anhydrous fuses at a bright-red heat (1098°). A small\r\nquantity of sodium carbonate placed in the loop of a platinum wire\r\nvolatilises in the heat of a gas flame, and therefore in the furnaces of\r\nglass works part of the soda is always transformed into the condition\r\nof vapour. Sodium carbonate resembles sodium sulphate in its relation\r\nto water.[18] Here also the greatest solubility is at the temperature\r\nof 37°; both salts, on crystallising at the ordinary temperature,\r\ncombine with ten molecules of water, and such crystals of soda, like\r\ncrystals of Glauber's salt, fuse at 34°. Sodium carbonate also forms a\r\nsupersaturated solution, and, according to the conditions, gives various\r\ncombinations with water of crystallisation (mentioned on page 108), &c.\r\n\r\n  [18] The resemblance is so great that, notwithstanding the difference\r\n       in the molecular composition of Na_{2}SO_{4} and Na_{2}CO_{3},\r\n       they ought to be classed under the type (NaO)_{2}R, where R =\r\n       SO_{2} or CO. Many other sodium salts also contain 10 mol. H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nAt a red heat superheated steam liberates carbonic anhydride from\r\nsodium carbonate and forms caustic soda, Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O = 2NaHO\r\n+ CO_{2}. Here the carbonic anhydride is replaced by water; this\r\ndepends on the feebly acid character of carbonic anhydride. By direct\r\nheating, sodium carbonate is only slightly decomposed into sodium oxide\r\nand carbonic anhydride; thus, when sodium carbonate is fused, about 1\r\nper cent. of carbonic anhydride is disengaged.[19] The carbonates of\r\nmany other metals--for instance, of calcium, copper, magnesium, iron,\r\n&c.--on being heated lose all their carbonic anhydride. This shows the\r\nconsiderable basic energy which sodium possesses. With the soluble salts\r\nof most metals, sodium carbonate gives precipitates either of insoluble\r\ncarbonates of the metals, or else of the hydroxides (in this latter\r\ncase carbonic anhydride is disengaged); for instance, with barium salts\r\nit precipitates an insoluble barium carbonate (BaCl_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3}\r\n= 2NaCl + BaCO_{3}) and with the aluminium salts it precipitates\r\naluminium hydroxide, carbonic anhydride being disengaged: 3Na_{2}CO_{3}\r\n+ Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 3H_{2}O = 3Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2Al(OH)_{3} + 3CO_{2}.\r\nSodium carbonate, like all the salts of carbonic acid, evolves carbonic\r\nanhydride on treatment with all acids which are to any extent energetic.\r\nBut if an acid diluted with water be gradually added to a solution of\r\nsodium carbonate, _at first_ such an evolution does not take place,\r\nbecause the excess of the carbonic anhydride forms acid sodium carbonate\r\n(sodium bicarbonate), NaHCO_{3}.[20] The acid sodium carbonate is an\r\nunstable salt. Not only when heated alone, but even on being slightly\r\nheated in solution, and also at the ordinary temperature in damp air,\r\nit loses carbonic anhydride and forms the normal salt. And at the\r\nsame time it is easy to obtain it in a pure crystalline form, if a\r\nstrong solution of sodium carbonate be cooled and a stream of carbonic\r\nanhydride gas passed through it. The acid salt is less soluble in water\r\nthan the normal,[21] and therefore a strong solution of the latter\r\ngives crystals of the acid salt if carbonic anhydride be passed through\r\nit. The acid salt may be yet more conveniently formed from effloresced\r\ncrystals of sodium carbonate, which, on being considerably heated, very\r\neasily absorb carbonic anhydride.[22] The acid salt crystallises well,\r\nbut not, however, in such large crystals as the normal salt; it has a\r\nbrackish and not an alkaline taste like that of the normal salt; its\r\nreaction is feebly alkaline, nearly neutral. At 70° its solution begins\r\nto lose carbonic anhydride, and on boiling the evolution becomes very\r\nabundant. From the preceding remarks it is clear that in most reactions\r\nthis salt, especially when heated, acts similarly to the normal salt,\r\nbut has, naturally, some distinction from it. Thus, for example, if a\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate be added to a normal magnesium salt, a\r\nturbidity (precipitate) is formed of magnesium carbonate. MgCO_{3}. No\r\nsuch precipitate is formed by the acid salt, because magnesium carbonate\r\nis soluble in the presence of an excess of carbonic anhydride.\r\n\r\n  [19] According to the observations of Pickering. According to Rose,\r\n       when solutions of sodium carbonate are boiled a certain amount of\r\n       carbonic anhydride is disengaged.\r\n\r\n  [20] The composition of this salt, however, may be also represented\r\n       as a combination of carbonic acid, H_{2}CO_{3}, with the normal\r\n       salt, Na_{2}CO_{3}, just as the latter also combines with water.\r\n       Such a combination is all the more likely because (1) there exists\r\n       another salt, Na_{2}CO_{3},2NaHCO_{3},2H_{2}O (sodium\r\n       sesquicarbonate), obtained by cooling a boiling solution of sodium\r\n       bicarbonate, or by mixing this salt with the normal salt; but the\r\n       formula of this salt cannot be derived from that of normal\r\n       carbonic acid, as the formula of the bicarbonate can. At the same\r\n       time the sesqui-salt has all the properties of a definite\r\n       compound; it crystallises in transparent crystals, has a constant\r\n       composition, its solubility (at 0° in 100 of water, 12·6 of\r\n       anhydrous salt) differs from the solubility of the normal and acid\r\n       salts; it is found in nature, and is known by the names of _trona_\r\n       and _urao_. The observations of Watts and Richards showed (1886)\r\n       that on pouring a strong solution of the acid salt into a solution\r\n       of the normal salt saturated by heating, crystals of the salt\r\n       NaHCO_{3},Na_{2}CO_{3},2H_{2}O may be easily obtained, as long as\r\n       the temperature is above 35°. The natural urao (Boussingault) has,\r\n       according to Laurent, the same composition. This salt is very\r\n       stable in air, and may be used for purifying sodium carbonate on\r\n       the large scale. Such compounds have been little studied from a\r\n       theoretical point of view, although particularly interesting,\r\n       since in all probability they correspond with ortho-carbonic acid,\r\n       C(OH)_{4}, and at the same time correspond with double salts like\r\n       astrakhanite (Chapter XIV., Note 25). (2) Water of crystallisation\r\n       does not enter into the composition of the crystals of the acid\r\n       salt, so that on its formation (occurring only at low\r\n       temperatures, as in the formation of crystalline compounds with\r\n       water) the water of crystallisation of the normal salt separates\r\n       and the water is, as it were, replaced by the elements of carbonic\r\n       acid. If anhydrous sodium carbonate be mixed with the amount of\r\n       water requisite for the formation of Na_{2}CO_{3},H_{2}O, this\r\n       salt will, when powdered, absorb CO_{2} as easily at the ordinary\r\n       temperature as it does water.\r\n\r\n  [21] 100 parts of water at 0° dissolve 7 parts of the acid salt, which\r\n       corresponds with 4·3 parts of the anhydrous normal salt, but at 0°\r\n       100 parts of water dissolve 7 parts of the latter. The solubility\r\n       of the bi-or acid salt varies with considerable regularity; 100\r\n       parts of water dissolves at 15° 9 parts of the salt, at 30° 11\r\n       parts.\r\n\r\n       The ammonium, and more especially the calcium, salt, is much more\r\n       soluble in water. The ammonia process (_see_ p. 524) is founded\r\n       upon this. Ammonium bicarbonate (acid carbonate) at 0° has a\r\n       solubility of 12 parts in 100 water, at 30° of 27 parts. The\r\n       solubility therefore increases very rapidly with the temperature.\r\n       And its saturated solution is more stable than a solution of\r\n       sodium bicarbonate. In fact, saturated solutions of these salts\r\n       have a gaseous tension like that of a mixture of carbonic\r\n       anhydride and water--namely, at 15° and at 50°, for the sodium\r\n       salt 120 and 750 millimetres, for the ammonium salt 120 and 563\r\n       millimetres. These data are of great importance in understanding\r\n       the phenomena connected with the ammonia process. They indicate\r\n       that with an increased pressure the formation of the sodium salt\r\n       ought to increase if there be an excess of ammonium salt.\r\n\r\n  [22] Crystalline sodium carbonate (broken into lumps) also absorbs\r\n       carbonic anhydride, but the water contained in the crystals is\r\n       then disengaged: Na_{2}CO_{3},10H_{2}O + CO_{2} =\r\n       Na_{2}CO_{3},H_{2}CO_{3} + 9H_{2}O, and dissolves part of the\r\n       carbonate; therefore part of the sodium carbonate passes into\r\n       solution together with all the impurities. When it is required to\r\n       avoid the formation of this solution, a mixture of ignited and\r\n       crystalline sodium carbonate is taken. Sodium bicarbonate is\r\n       prepared chiefly for medicinal use, and is then often termed\r\n       _carbonate of soda_, also, for instance, in the so-called soda\r\n       powders, for preparing certain artificial mineral waters, for the\r\n       manufacture of digestive lozenges like those made at Essentuki,\r\n       Vichy, &c.\r\n\r\nSodium carbonate is used for the preparation of _caustic soda_[23]--that\r\nis, the hydrate of sodium oxide, or the alkali which corresponds to\r\nsodium. For this purpose the action of lime on a solution of sodium\r\ncarbonate is generally made use of. The process is as follows: a weak,\r\ngenerally 10 per cent., solution of sodium carbonate is taken,[24] and\r\nboiled in a cast-iron, wrought-iron, or silver boiler (sodium hydroxide\r\ndoes not act on these metals), and lime is added, little by little,\r\nduring the boiling. This latter is soluble in water, although but very\r\nslightly. The clear solution becomes turbid on the addition of the lime\r\nbecause a precipitate is formed; this precipitate consists of calcium\r\ncarbonate, almost insoluble in water, whilst caustic soda is formed\r\nand remains in solution. The decomposition is effected according to\r\nthe equation: Na_{2}CO_{3} + Ca(HO)_{2} = CaCO_{3} + 2NaHO. On cooling\r\nthe solution the calcium carbonate easily settles as a precipitate,\r\nand the clear solution or alkali above it contains the easily soluble\r\nsodium hydroxide formed in the reaction.[25] After the necessary\r\nquantity of lime has been added, the solution is allowed to stand, and\r\nis then decanted off and evaporated in cast or wrought iron boilers,\r\nor in silver pans if a perfectly pure product is required.[26] The\r\nevaporation cannot be conducted in china, glass, or similar vessels,\r\nbecause caustic soda attacks these materials, although but slightly. The\r\nsolution does not crystallise on evaporation, because the solubility\r\nof caustic soda when hot is very great, but crystals containing water\r\nof crystallisation may be obtained by cooling. If the evaporation\r\nof the alkali be conducted until the specific gravity reaches 1·38,\r\nand the liquid is then cooled to 0°, transparent crystals appear\r\ncontaining 2NaHO,7H_{2}O; they fuse at +6°.[27] If the evaporation be\r\nconducted so long as water is disengaged, which requires a considerable\r\namount of heat, then, on cooling, the hydroxide, NaHO, solidifies\r\nin a semi-transparent crystalline mass,[28] which eagerly absorbs\r\nmoisture and carbonic anhydride from the air.[29] Its specific gravity\r\nis 2·13;[30] it is easily soluble in water, with disengagement of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of heat.[31] A saturated solution at the ordinary\r\ntemperature has a specific gravity of about 1·5, contains about 45 per\r\ncent. of sodium hydroxide, and boils at 130°; at 55° water dissolves\r\nan equal weight of it.[32] Caustic soda is not only soluble in water\r\nbut in alcohol, and even in ether. Dilute solutions of sodium hydroxide\r\nproduce a soapy feeling on the skin because the active base of soap\r\nconsists of caustic soda.[33] Strong solutions have a corroding action.\r\n\r\n  [23] In chemistry, sodium oxide is termed 'soda,' which word must be\r\n       carefully distinguished from the word sodium, meaning the metal.\r\n\r\n  [24] With a small quantity of water, the reaction either does not\r\n       take place, or even proceeds in the reverse way--that is, sodium\r\n       and potassium hydroxides remove carbonic anhydride from calcium\r\n       carbonate (Liebig, Watson, Mitscherlich, and others). The\r\n       influence of the mass of water is evident. According to Gerberts,\r\n       however, strong solutions of sodium carbonate are decomposed by\r\n       lime, which is very interesting if confirmed by further\r\n       investigation.\r\n\r\n  [25] As long as any undecomposed sodium carbonate remains in solution,\r\n       excess of acid added to the solution disengages carbonic\r\n       anhydride, and the solution after dilution gives a white\r\n       precipitate with a barium salt soluble in acids, showing the\r\n       presence of a carbonate in solution (if there be sulphate present,\r\n       it also forms a white precipitate, but this is insoluble in\r\n       acids). For the decomposition of sodium carbonate, milk of\r\n       lime--that is, slaked slime suspended in water--is employed.\r\n       Formerly pure sodium hydroxide was prepared (according to\r\n       Berthollet's process) by dissolving the impure substance in\r\n       alcohol (sodium carbonate and sulphate are not soluble), but now\r\n       that metallic sodium has become cheap and is purified by\r\n       distillation, _pure caustic soda_ is prepared by acting on a small\r\n       quantity of water with sodium. Perfectly pure sodium hydroxide may\r\n       also be obtained by allowing strong solutions to crystallise (in\r\n       the cold) (Note 27).\r\n\r\n       In alkali works where the Leblanc process is used, caustic soda is\r\n       prepared directly from the alkali remaining in the mother liquors\r\n       after the separation of the sodium carbonate by evaporation (Note\r\n       14). If excess of lime and charcoal have been used, much sodium\r\n       hydroxide maybe obtained. After the removal as much as possible of\r\n       the sodium carbonate, a red liquid (from iron oxide) is left,\r\n       containing sodium hydroxide mixed with compounds of sulphur and of\r\n       cyanogen (_see_ Chapter IX.) and also containing iron. This red\r\n       alkali is evaporated and air is blown through it, which oxidises\r\n       the impurities (for this purpose sometimes sodium nitrate is\r\n       added, or bleaching powder, &c.) and leaves fused caustic soda.\r\n       The fused mass is allowed to settle in order to separate the\r\n       ferruginous precipitate, and poured into iron drums, where the\r\n       sodium hydroxide solidifies. Such caustic soda contains about 10\r\n       p.c. of water in excess and some saline impurities, but when\r\n       properly manufactured is almost free from carbonate and from iron.\r\n       The greater part of the caustic soda, which forms so important an\r\n       article of commerce, is manufactured in this manner.\r\n\r\n  [26] Löwig gave a method of preparing sodium hydroxide from sodium\r\n       carbonate by heating it to a dull red heat with an excess of\r\n       ferric oxide. Carbonic anhydride is given off, and warm water\r\n       extracts the caustic soda from the remaining mass. This reaction,\r\n       as experiment shows, proceeds very easily, and is an example of\r\n       contact action similar to that of ferric oxide on the\r\n       decomposition of potassium chlorate. The reason of this may be\r\n       that a small quantity of the sodium carbonate enters into double\r\n       decomposition with the ferric oxide, and the ferric carbonate\r\n       produced is decomposed into carbonic anhydride and ferric oxide,\r\n       the action of which is renewed. Similar explanations expressing\r\n       the _reason_ for a reaction really adds but little to that\r\n       elementary conception of contact which, according to my opinion,\r\n       consists in the change of motion of the atoms in the molecules\r\n       under the influence of the substance in contact. In order to\r\n       represent this clearly it is sufficient, for instance, to imagine\r\n       that in the sodium carbonate the elements CO_{2} move in a circle\r\n       round the elements Na_{2}O, but at the points of contact with\r\n       Fe_{2}O_{3} the motion becomes elliptic with a long axis, and at\r\n       some distance from Na_{2}O the elements of CO_{2} are parted, not\r\n       having the faculty of attaching themselves to Fe_{2}O_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [27] By allowing strong solutions of sodium hydroxide to crystallise in\r\n       the cold, impurities--such as, for instance, sodium sulphate--may\r\n       be separated from them. The fused crystallo-hydrate 2NaHO,7H_{2}O\r\n       forms a solution having a specific gravity of 1·405 (Hermes). The\r\n       crystals on dissolving in water produce cold, while NaHO produces\r\n       heat. Besides which Pickering obtained hydrates with 1, 2, 4, 5,\r\n       and 7 H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [28] In solid caustic soda there is generally an excess of water beyond\r\n       that required by the formula NaHO. The caustic soda used in\r\n       laboratories is generally cast in sticks, which are broken into\r\n       pieces. It must be preserved in carefully closed vessels, because\r\n       it absorbs water and carbonic anhydride from the air.\r\n\r\n  [29] By the way it changes in air it is easy to distinguish caustic\r\n       soda from caustic potash, which in general resembles it. Both\r\n       alkalis absorb water and carbonic anhydride from the air, but\r\n       caustic potash forms a deliquescent mass of potassium carbonate,\r\n       whilst caustic soda forms a dry powder of efflorescent salt.\r\n\r\n  [30] As the molecular weight of NaHO = 40, the volume of its molecule =\r\n       40/2·13 = 18·5, which very nearly approaches the volume of a\r\n       molecule of water. The same rule applies to the compounds of\r\n       sodium in general--for instance, its salts have a molecular volume\r\n       approaching the volume of the acids from which they are derived.\r\n\r\n  [31] The molecular quantity of sodium hydroxide (40 grams), on being\r\n       dissolved in a large mass (200 gram molecules) of water, develops,\r\n       according to Berthelot 9,780, and according to Thomsen 9,940,\r\n       heat-units, but at 100° about 13,000 (Berthelot). Solutions of\r\n       NaHO + _n_H_{2}O, on being mixed with water, evolve heat if they\r\n       contain less than 6H_{2}O, but if more they absorb beat.\r\n\r\n  [32] The specific gravity of solutions of sodium hydroxide at 15°/4° is\r\n       given in the short table below:--\r\n\r\n          NaHO, p.c.    5      10     15     20     30     40\r\n          Sp. gr.     1·057  1·113  1·169  1·224  1·331  1·436\r\n\r\n\r\n       1,000 grams of a 5 p.c. solution occupies a volume of 946 c.c.;\r\n       that is, less than the water serving to make the solution (_see_\r\n       Note 18).\r\n\r\n  [33] Sodium hydroxide and some other alkalis are capable of\r\n       hydrolysing--saponifying, as it is termed--the compounds of acids\r\n       with alcohols. If RHO (or R(HO)_{_n_}) represent the composition\r\n       of an alcohol--that is, of the hydroxide of a hydrocarbon\r\n       radicle--and QHO an acid, then the compound of the acid with the\r\n       alcohol or ethereal salt of the given acid will have the\r\n       composition RQO. Ethereal salts, therefore, present a likeness to\r\n       metallic salts, just as alcohols resemble basic hydroxides. Sodium\r\n       hydroxide acts on ethereal salts in the same way that it acts on\r\n       the majority of metallic salts--namely, it liberates alcohol, and\r\n       forms the sodium salt of that acid which was in the ethereal salt.\r\n       The reaction takes place in the following way:--\r\n\r\n                    RQO    +  NaHO   =  NaQO  +   RHO\r\n                  Ethereal   Caustic   Sodium   Alcohol\r\n                    salt      soda      salt\r\n\r\n       Such a decomposition is termed saponification; similar reactions\r\n       were known very long ago for the ethereal salts corresponding with\r\n       glycerin, C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} (Chapter IX.), found in animals and\r\n       plants, and composing what are called fats or oils. Caustic soda,\r\n       acting on fat and oil, forms glycerin, and sodium salts of those\r\n       acids which were in union with the glycerin in the fat, as\r\n       Chevreul showed at the beginning of this century. The sodium salts\r\n       of the fatty acids are commonly known as soaps. That is to say,\r\n       soap is made from fat and caustic soda, glycerin being separated\r\n       and a sodium salt or soap formed. As glycerin is usually found in\r\n       union with certain acids, so also are the sodium salts of the same\r\n       acids found in soap. The greater part of the acids found in\r\n       conjunction with glycerin in fats are the solid palmitic and\r\n       stearic acids, C_{16}H_{32}O_{2} and C_{18}H_{38}O_{2}, and the\r\n       liquid oleic acid, C_{18}H_{34}O_{2}. In preparing soap the fatty\r\n       substances are mixed with a solution of caustic soda until an\r\n       emulsion is formed; the proper quantity of caustic soda is then\r\n       added in order to produce saponification on heating, the soap\r\n       being separated from the solution either by means of an excess of\r\n       caustic soda or else by common salt, which displaces the soap from\r\n       the aqueous solution (salt water does not dissolve soap, neither\r\n       does it form a lather). Water acting on soap partly decomposes it\r\n       (because the acids of the soap are feeble), and the alkali set\r\n       free acts during the application of soap. Hence it may be replaced\r\n       by a very feeble alkali. Strong solutions of alkali corrode the\r\n       skin and tissues. They are not formed from soap, because the\r\n       reaction is reversible, and the alkali is only set free by the\r\n       excess of water. Thus we see how the teaching of Berthollet\r\n       renders it possible to understand many phenomena which occur in\r\n       every-day experience (_see_ Chapter IX., Note 15).\r\n\r\nThe chemical _reactions of sodium hydroxide_ serve as a type for those\r\nof a whole class of alkalis--that is, of soluble basic hydroxides,\r\nMOH. The solution of sodium hydroxide is a very caustic liquid--that\r\nis to say, it acts in a destructive way on most substances, for\r\ninstance on most organic tissues--hence caustic soda, like all soluble\r\nalkalis, is a poisonous substance; acids, for example hydrochloric,\r\nserve as antidotes. The action of caustic soda on bones, fat, starch,\r\nand similar vegetable and animal substances explains its action on\r\norganisms. Thus bones, when plunged into a weak solution of caustic\r\nsoda, fall to powder,[34] and evolve a smell of ammonia, owing to the\r\ncaustic soda changing the gelatinous organic substance of the bones\r\n(which contains carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, like\r\nalbumin), dissolving it and in part destroying it, whence ammonia is\r\ndisengaged. Fats, tallow, and oils become saponified by a solution of\r\ncaustic soda--that is to say, they form with it _soaps_ soluble in\r\nwater, or sodium salts of the organic acids contained in the fats.[35]\r\nThe most characteristic reactions of sodium hydroxide are determined by\r\nthe fact that it _saturates all acids, forming salts with them_, which\r\nare almost all soluble in water, and in this respect caustic soda is as\r\ncharacteristic amongst the bases as nitric acid is among the acids. It\r\nis impossible to detect sodium by means of the formation of precipitates\r\nof insoluble sodium salts, as may be done with other metals, many of\r\nwhose salts are but slightly soluble. The powerful alkaline properties\r\nof caustic soda determine its capacity for combining with even the\r\nfeeblest acids, its property of disengaging ammonia from ammonium salts,\r\nits faculty of forming precipitates from solutions of salts whose bases\r\nare insoluble in water, &c. If a solution of the salt of almost any\r\nmetal be mixed with caustic soda, then a soluble sodium salt will be\r\nformed, and an insoluble hydroxide of the metal will be separated--for\r\ninstance, copper nitrate yields copper hydroxide, Cu(NO_{3})_{2} + 2NaHO\r\n= Cu(HO)_{2} + 2NaNO_{3}. Even many _basic oxides_ precipitated by\r\ncaustic soda _are capable_ of _combining_ with it and forming soluble\r\ncompounds, and therefore caustic soda in the presence of salts of such\r\nmetals first forms a precipitate of hydroxide, and then, employed in\r\nexcess, dissolves this precipitate. This phenomenon occurs, for example,\r\nwhen caustic soda is added to the salts of aluminium. This shows the\r\nproperty of such an alkali as caustic soda of combining not only with\r\nacids, but also with feeble basic oxides. For this reason caustic soda\r\n_acts on most elements_ which are capable of forming acids or oxides\r\nsimilar to them; thus the metal aluminium gives hydrogen with caustic\r\nsoda in consequence of the formation of alumina, which combines with\r\nthe caustic soda--that is, in this case, the caustic alkali acts on the\r\nmetal just as sulphuric acid does on Fe or Zn. If caustic soda acts\r\nin this manner on a metalloid capable of combining with the hydrogen\r\nevolved (aluminium does not give a compound with hydrogen), then it\r\nforms such a hydrogen compound. Thus, for instance, phosphorus acts in\r\nthis way on caustic soda, yielding hydrogen phosphide. When the hydrogen\r\ncompound disengaged is capable of combining with the alkali, then,\r\nnaturally, a salt of the corresponding acid is formed. For example,\r\nchlorine and sulphur act in this way on caustic soda. Chlorine, with the\r\nhydrogen of the caustic soda, forms hydrochloric acid, and the latter\r\nforms common salt with the sodium hydroxide, whilst the other atom in\r\nthe molecule of chlorine, Cl_{2}, takes the place of the hydrogen, and\r\nforms the hypochlorite, NaClO. In the same way, by the action of sodium\r\nhydroxide on sulphur, hydrogen sulphide is formed, which acts on the\r\nsoda forming sodium _sulphide_, in addition to which sodium thiosulphate\r\nis formed (_see_ Chapter XX.) By virtue of such reactions, sodium\r\nhydroxide acts on many metals and non-metals. Such action is often\r\naccelerated by the presence of the oxygen of the air, as by this means\r\nthe formation of acids and oxides rich in oxygen is facilitated. Thus\r\nmany metals and their lower oxides, in the presence of an alkali, absorb\r\noxygen and form acids. Even manganese peroxide, when mixed with caustic\r\nsoda, is capable of absorbing the oxygen of the air, and forming sodium\r\nmanganate. Organic acids when heated with caustic soda give up to it the\r\nelements of carbonic anhydride, forming sodium carbonate, and separating\r\nthat hydrocarbon group which exists, in combination with carbonic\r\nanhydride, in the organic acid.\r\n\r\n  [34] On this is founded the process of Henkoff and Engelhardt for\r\n       treating bones. The bones are mixed with ashes, lime, and water;\r\n       it is true that in this case more potassium hydroxide than sodium\r\n       hydroxide is formed, but their action is almost identical.\r\n\r\n  [35] As explained in Note 33.\r\n\r\nThus sodium hydroxide, like the soluble alkalis in general, ranks\r\namongst the most active substances in the chemical sense of the term,\r\nand but few substances are capable of resisting it. Even siliceous\r\nrocks, as we shall see further on, are transformed by it, forming when\r\nfused with it vitreous slags. Sodium hydroxide (like ammonium and\r\npotassium hydroxides), as a typical example of the basic hydrates, in\r\ndistinction from many other basic oxides, easily _forms acid salts_\r\nwith acids (for instance, NaHSO_{4}, NaHCO_{3}), and does not form any\r\nbasic salts at all; whilst many less energetic bases, such as the oxides\r\nof copper and lead, easily form basic salts, but acid salts only with\r\ndifficulty. This capability of forming acid salts, particularly with\r\npolybasic acids, may be explained by the energetic basic properties\r\nof sodium hydroxide, contrasted with the small development of these\r\nproperties in the bases which easily form basic salts. An energetic\r\nbase is capable of retaining a considerable quantity of acid, which a\r\nslightly energetic base would not have the power of doing. Also, as will\r\nbe shown in the subsequent chapters, sodium belongs to the univalent\r\nmetals, being exchangeable for hydrogen atom for atom--that is, amongst\r\nmetals sodium may, like chlorine amongst the non-metals, serve as the\r\nrepresentative of the univalent properties. Most of the elements which\r\nare not capable of forming acid salts are bivalent. Whence it may be\r\nunderstood that in a bibasic acid--for instance, carbonic, H_{2}CO_{3},\r\nor sulphuric, H_{2}SO_{4}--the hydrogen may be exchanged, atom for atom,\r\nfor sodium, and yield an acid salt by means of the first substitution,\r\nand a normal salt by means of the second--for instance, NaHSO_{4}, and\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}, whilst such bivalent metals as calcium and barium do not\r\nform acid salts because one of their atoms at once takes the place of\r\nboth hydrogen atoms, forming, for example, CaCO_{3} and CaSO_{4}.[35 bis]\r\n\r\n  [35 bis] It might be expected, from what has been mentioned above, that\r\n       bivalent metals would easily form acid salts with acids containing\r\n       more than two atoms of hydrogen--for instance, with tribasic\r\n       acids, such as phosphoric acid, H_{3}PO_{4}--and actually such\r\n       salts do exist; but all such relations are complicated by the fact\r\n       that the character of the base very often changes and becomes\r\n       weakened with the increase of valency and the change of atomic\r\n       weight; the feebler bases (like silver oxide), although\r\n       corresponding with univalent metals, do not form acid salts, while\r\n       the feeblest bases (CuO, PbO, &c.) easily form basic salts, and\r\n       notwithstanding their valency do not form acid salts which are in\r\n       any degree stable--that is, which are undecomposable by water.\r\n       Basic and acid salts ought to be regarded rather as compounds\r\n       similar to crystallo-hydrates, because such acids as sulphuric\r\n       form with sodium not only an acid and a normal salt, as might be\r\n       expected from the valency of sodium, but also salts containing a\r\n       greater quantity of acid. In sodium sesquicarbonate we saw an\r\n       example of such compounds. Taking all this into consideration, we\r\n       must say that the property of more or less easily forming acid\r\n       salts depends more upon the energy of the base than upon its\r\n       valency, and the best statement is that _the capacity of a base\r\n       for forming acid and basic salts is characteristic_, just as the\r\n       faculty of forming compounds with hydrogen is characteristic of\r\n       elements.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the transformation of common salt into sodium sulphate,\r\nof this latter into sodium carbonate, and of sodium carbonate into\r\ncaustic soda. Lavoisier still regarded sodium hydroxide as an element,\r\nbecause he was unacquainted with its decomposition with the formation\r\nof metallic sodium, which separates the hydrogen from water, reforming\r\ncaustic soda.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of _metallic sodium_ was one of the greatest discoveries\r\nin chemistry, not only because through it the conception of elements\r\nbecame broader and more correct, but especially because in sodium,\r\nchemical properties were observed which were but feebly shown in the\r\nother metals more familiarly known. This discovery was made in 1807\r\nby the English chemist _Davy_ by means of the galvanic current. By\r\nconnecting with the positive pole (of copper or carbon) a piece of\r\ncaustic soda (moistened in order to obtain electrical conductivity),\r\nand boring a hole in it filled with mercury connected with the negative\r\npole of a strong Volta's pile, Davy observed that on passing the current\r\na peculiar metal dissolved in the mercury, less volatile than mercury,\r\nand capable of decomposing water, again forming caustic soda. In this\r\nway (by analysis and synthesis) Davy demonstrated the compound nature\r\nof alkalis. On being decomposed by the galvanic current, caustic soda\r\ndisengages hydrogen and sodium at the negative pole and oxygen at the\r\npositive pole. Davy showed that the metal formed volatilises at a red\r\nheat, and this is its most important physical property in relation to\r\nits extraction, all later methods being founded on it. Besides this Davy\r\nobserved that sodium easily oxidises, its vapour taking fire in air,\r\nand the latter circumstance was for a long time an obstacle to the easy\r\npreparation of this metal. The properties of sodium were subsequently\r\nmore thoroughly investigated by Gay-Lussac and Thénard, who observed\r\nthat metallic iron at a high temperature was capable of reducing caustic\r\nsoda to sodium.[36] Brunner latterly discovered that not only iron,\r\nbut also charcoal, has this property, although hydrogen has not.[37]\r\nBut still the methods of extracting sodium were very troublesome,\r\nand consequently it was a great rarity. The principal obstacle\r\nto its production was that an endeavour was made to condense the\r\neasily-oxidising vapours of sodium in vacuo in complicated apparatus.\r\nFor this reason, when Donny and Maresca, having thoroughly studied the\r\nmatter, constructed a specially simple condenser, the production of\r\nsodium was much facilitated. Furthermore, in practice the most important\r\nepoch in the history of the production of sodium is comprised in the\r\ninvestigation of Sainte-Claire Deville, who avoided the complex methods\r\nin vogue up to that time, and furnished those simple means by which the\r\nproduction of sodium is now rendered feasible in chemical works.\r\n\r\n  [36] Deville supposes that such a decomposition of sodium hydroxide\r\n       by metallic iron depends solely on the dissociation of the alkali\r\n       at a white heat into sodium, hydrogen, and oxygen. Here the part\r\n       played by the iron is only that it retains the oxygen formed,\r\n       otherwise the decomposed elements would again reunite upon\r\n       cooling, as in other cases of dissociation. If it be supposed that\r\n       the temperature at the commencement of the dissociation of the\r\n       iron oxides is higher than that of sodium oxide, then the\r\n       decomposition may be explained by Deville's hypothesis. Deville\r\n       demonstrates his views by the following experiment:--An iron\r\n       bottle, filled with iron borings, was heated in such a way that\r\n       the upper part became red hot, the lower part remaining cooler;\r\n       sodium hydroxide was introduced into the upper part. The\r\n       decomposition was then effected--that is, sodium vapours were\r\n       produced (this experiment was really performed with potassium\r\n       hydroxide). On opening the bottle it was found that the iron in\r\n       the upper part was not oxidised, but only that in the lower part.\r\n       This may be explained by the decomposition of the alkali into\r\n       sodium, hydrogen, and oxygen taking place in the upper part,\r\n       whilst the iron in the lower part absorbed the oxygen set free. If\r\n       the whole bottle be subjected to the same moderate heat as the\r\n       lower extremity, no metallic vapours are formed. In that case,\r\n       according to the hypothesis, the temperature is insufficient for\r\n       the dissociation of the sodium hydroxide.\r\n\r\n  [37] It has been previously remarked (Chapter II. Note 9) that Beketoff\r\n       showed the displacement of sodium by hydrogen, not from sodium\r\n       hydroxide but from the oxide Na_{2}O; then, however, only one half\r\n       is displaced, with the formation of NaHO.\r\n\r\nFor the production of sodium according to Deville's method, a mixture\r\nof anhydrous sodium carbonate (7 parts), charcoal (two parts), and lime\r\nor chalk (7 parts) is heated. This latter ingredient is only added in\r\norder that the sodium carbonate, on fusing, shall not separate from\r\nthe charcoal.[38] The chalk on being heated loses carbonic anhydride,\r\nleaving infusible lime, which is permeated by the sodium carbonate and\r\nforms a thick mass, in which the charcoal is intimately mixed with the\r\nsodium carbonate. When the charcoal is heated with the sodium carbonate,\r\nat a white heat, carbonic oxide and vapours of sodium are disengaged,\r\naccording to the equation:\r\n\r\n                    Na_{2}CO_{3} + 2C = Na_{2} + 3CO\r\n\r\n  [38] Since the close of the eighties in England, where the preparation\r\n       of sodium is at present carried out on a large commercial scale\r\n       (from 1860 to 1870 it was only manufactured in a few works in\r\n       France), it has been the practice to add to Deville's mixture\r\n       iron, or iron oxide which with the charcoal gives metallic and\r\n       carburetted iron, which still further facilitates the\r\n       decomposition. At present a kilogram of sodium may be purchased\r\n       for about the same sum (2/-) as a gram cost thirty years ago.\r\n       Castner, in England, greatly improved the manufacture of sodium in\r\n       large quantities, and so cheapened it as a reducing agent in the\r\n       preparation of metallic aluminium. He heated a mixture of 44 parts\r\n       of NaHO, and 7 parts of carbide of iron in large iron retorts at\r\n       1,000° and obtained about 6-1/2 parts of metallic sodium. The\r\n       reaction proceeds more easily than with carbon or iron alone, and\r\n       the decomposition of the NaHO proceeds according to the equation:\r\n       3NaHO + C = Na_{2}CO_{3} + 3H + Na. Subsequently, in 1891,\r\n       aluminium was prepared by electrolysis (_see_ Chapter XVII.), and\r\n       metallic sodium found two new uses; (1) for the manufacture of\r\n       peroxide of sodium (see later on) which is used in bleaching\r\n       works, and (2) in the manufacture of potassium and sodium cyanide\r\n       from yellow prussiate (Chapter XIII., Note 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Manufacture of sodium by Deville's process.\r\nA C, iron tube containing a mixture of soda, charcoal, and chalk. B,\r\ncondenser.]\r\n\r\nOn cooling the vapours and gases disengaged, the vapours condense into\r\nmolten metal (in this form sodium does not easily oxidise, whilst in\r\nvapour it burns) and the carbonic oxide remains as gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Donny and Maresca's sodium condenser, consisting\r\nof two cast-iron plates screwed together.]\r\n\r\nIn sodium works an iron tube, about a metre long and a decimeter in\r\ndiameter, is made out of boiler plate. The pipe is luted into a furnace\r\nhaving a strong draught, capable of giving a high temperature, and the\r\ntube is charged with the mixture required for the preparation of sodium.\r\nOne end of the tube is closed with a cast-iron stopper A with clay\r\nluting, and the other with the cast-iron stopper C provided with an\r\naperture. On heating, first of all the moisture contained in the various\r\nsubstances is given off, then carbonic anhydride and the products of the\r\ndry distillation of the charcoal, then the latter begins to act on the\r\nsodium carbonate, and carbonic oxide and vapours of sodium appear. It is\r\neasy to observe the appearance of the latter, because on issuing from\r\nthe aperture in the stopper C they take fire spontaneously and burn with\r\na very bright yellow flame. A pipe is then introduced into the aperture\r\nC, compelling the vapours and gases formed to pass through the condenser\r\nB. This condenser consists of two square cast-iron trays, A and A´, fig.\r\n71, with wide edges firmly screwed together. Between these two trays\r\nthere is a space in which the condensation of the vapours of sodium is\r\neffected, the thin metallic walls of the condenser being cooled by the\r\nair but remaining hot enough to preserve the sodium in a liquid state,\r\nso that it does not choke the apparatus, but continually flows from\r\nit. The vapours of sodium, condensing in the cooler, flow in the shape\r\nof liquid metal into a vessel containing some non-volatile naphtha or\r\nhydrocarbon. This is used in order to prevent the sodium oxidising as\r\nit issues from the condenser at a somewhat high temperature. In order\r\nto obtain sodium of a pure quality it is necessary to distil it once\r\nmore, which may even be done in porcelain retorts, but the distillation\r\nmust be conducted in a stream of some gas on which sodium does not\r\nact, for instance in a stream of nitrogen; carbonic anhydride is not\r\napplicable, because sodium partially decomposes it, absorbing oxygen\r\nfrom it. Although the above described methods of preparing sodium by\r\nchemical means have proved very convenient in practice, still it is now\r\n(since 1893) found profitable in England to obtain it (to the amount of\r\nseveral tons a week) by Davy's classical method, _i.e._ by the action of\r\nan electric current at a moderately high temperature, because the means\r\nfor producing an electric current (by motors and dynamos) now render\r\nthis quite feasible. This may be regarded as a sign that in process of\r\ntime many other technical methods for producing various substances by\r\n_decomposition_ may be profitably carried on by electrolysis.\r\n\r\nPure sodium is a lustrous metal, white as silver, soft as wax; it\r\nbecomes brittle in the cold. In ordinary moist air it quickly tarnishes\r\nand becomes covered with a film of hydroxide, NaHO, formed at the\r\nexpense of the water in the air. In perfectly dry air sodium retains its\r\nlustre for an indefinite time. Its density at the ordinary temperature\r\nis equal to 0·98, so that it is lighter than water; it fuses very\r\neasily at a temperature of 95°, and distils at a bright red heat (742°\r\naccording to Perman, 1889). Scott (1887) determined the density of\r\nsodium vapour and found it to be nearly 12 (if H = 1). This shows that\r\nits molecule contains one atom (like mercury and cadmium) Na.[38 bis] It\r\nforms alloys with most metals, combining with them, heat being sometimes\r\nevolved and sometimes absorbed. Thus, if sodium (having a clean surface)\r\nbe thrown into mercury, especially when heated, there is a flash, and\r\nsuch a considerable amount of heat is evolved that part of the mercury\r\nis transformed into vapour.[39] Compounds or solutions of sodium in\r\nmercury, or _amalgams_ of sodium, even when containing 2 parts of sodium\r\nto 100 parts of mercury, are solids. Only those amalgams which are the\r\nvery poorest in sodium are liquid. Such alloys of sodium with mercury\r\nare often used instead of sodium in chemical investigations, because in\r\ncombination with mercury sodium is not easily acted on by air, and is\r\nheavier than water, and therefore more convenient to handle, whilst at\r\nthe same time it retains the principal properties of sodium,[40] for\r\ninstance it decomposes water, forming NaHO.\r\n\r\n  [38 bis] This is also shown by the fall in the temperature of\r\n       solidification of tin produced by the addition of sodium (and also\r\n       Al and Zn). Heycock and Neville (1889).\r\n\r\n  [39] By dissolving sodium amalgams in water and acids, and deducting\r\n       the heat of solution of the sodium, Berthelot found that _for each\r\n       atom of the sodium_ in amalgams containing a larger amount of\r\n       mercury than NaHg_{5}, the amount of heat evolved increases, after\r\n       which the heat of formation falls, and the heat evolved decreases.\r\n       In the formation of NaHg_{5} about 18,500 calories are evolved;\r\n       when NaHg_{3} is formed, about 14,000; and for NaHg about 10,000\r\n       calories. Kraft regarded the definite crystalline amalgam as\r\n       having the composition of NaHg_{6}, but at the present time, in\r\n       accordance with Grimaldi's results, it is thought to be NaHg_{5}.\r\n       A similar amalgam is very easily obtained if a 3 p.c. amalgam be\r\n       left several days in a solution of sodium hydroxide until a\r\n       crystalline mass is formed, from which the mercury may be removed\r\n       by strongly pressing in chamois leather. This amalgam with a\r\n       solution of potassium hydroxide forms a potassium amalgam,\r\n       KHg_{10}. It may be mentioned here that the latent heat of fusion\r\n       (of atomic quantities) of Hg = 360 (Personne), Na = 730 (Joannis),\r\n       and K = 610 calories (Joannis).\r\n\r\n  [40] Alloys are so similar to solutions (exhibiting such complete\r\n       parallelism in properties) that they are included in the same\r\n       class of so-called indefinite compounds. But in alloys, as\r\n       substances passing from the liquid to the solid state, it is\r\n       easier to discover the formation of definite chemical compounds.\r\n       Besides the alloys of Na with Hg, those with tin (Bailey 1892\r\n       found Na_{2}Sn), lead (NaPb), bismuth (Na_{3}Bi), &c. (Joannis\r\n       1892 and others) have been investigated.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to form an alloy of mercury and sodium having a crystalline\r\nstructure, and a definite atomic composition, NaHg_{5}. The alloy\r\nof sodium with hydrogen or _sodium hydride_, Na_{2}H, which has the\r\nexternal appearance of a metal,[41] is a most instructive example of\r\nthe characteristics of alloys. At the ordinary temperature sodium does\r\nnot absorb hydrogen, but from 300° to 421° the absorption takes place\r\nat the ordinary pressure (and at an increased pressure even at higher\r\ntemperatures), as shown by Troost and Hautefeuille (1874). One volume of\r\nsodium absorbs as much as 238 volumes of hydrogen. The metal increases\r\nin volume, and when once formed the alloy can be preserved for some time\r\nwithout change at the ordinary temperature. The appearance of sodium\r\nhydride resembles that of sodium itself; it is as soft as this latter,\r\nwhen heated it becomes brittle, and decomposes above 300°, evolving\r\nhydrogen. In this decomposition all the phenomena of dissociation are\r\nvery clearly shown--that is, the hydrogen gas evolved has a definite\r\ntension[42] corresponding with each definite temperature. This confirms\r\nthe fact that the formation of substances capable of dissociation can\r\nonly be accomplished within the dissociation limits. Sodium hydride\r\nmelts more easily than sodium itself, and then does not undergo\r\ndecomposition if it is in an atmosphere of hydrogen. It oxidises easily\r\nin air, but not so easily as potassium hydride. The chemical reactions\r\nof sodium are retained in its hydride, and, if we may so express it,\r\nthey are even increased by the addition of hydrogen. At all events,\r\nin the properties of sodium hydride[43] we see other properties than\r\nin such hydrogen compounds as HCl, H_{2}O, H_{3}N, H_{4}C, or even in\r\nthe gaseous metallic hydrides AsH_{3}, TeH_{2}. Platinum, palladium,\r\nnickel, and iron, in absorbing hydrogen form compounds in which hydrogen\r\nis in a similar state. In them, as in sodium hydride, the hydrogen is\r\ncompressed, absorbed, occluded (Chapter II.)[43 bis]\r\n\r\n  [41] Potassium forms a similar compound, but lithium, under the same\r\n       circumstances, does not.\r\n\r\n  [42] The tension of dissociation of hydrogen _p_, in millimetres of\r\n       mercury, is:--\r\n\r\n                             _t_ = 330°  350°  400°   430°\r\n                for Na_{2}H  _p_ =  28    57   447    910\r\n                for K_{2}H          45    72   548   1100\r\n\r\n\r\n  [43] In general, during the formation of alloys the volumes change\r\n       very slightly, and therefore from the volume of Na_{2}H some idea\r\n       may be formed of the volume of hydrogen in a solid or liquid\r\n       state. Even Archimedes concluded that there was gold in an alloy\r\n       of copper and gold by reason of its volume and density. From the\r\n       fact that the density of Na_{2}H is equal to 0·959, it may be seen\r\n       that the volume of 47 grams (the gram molecule) of this compound =\r\n       49·0 c.c. The volume of 46 grams of sodium contained in the\r\n       Na_{2}H (the density under the same conditions being 0·97) is\r\n       equal to 47·4 c.c. Therefore the volume of 1 gram of hydrogen in\r\n       Na_{2}H is equal to 1·6 c.c., and consequently the density of\r\n       metallic hydrogen, or the weight of 1 c.c., approaches 0·6 gram.\r\n       This density is also proper to the hydrogen alloyed with potassium\r\n       and palladium. Judging from the scanty information which is at\r\n       present available, liquid hydrogen near its absolute boiling point\r\n       (Chapter II.) has a much lower density.\r\n\r\n  [43 bis] We may remark that at low temperatures Na absorbs NH_{3} and\r\n       forms (NH_{3}Na)_{2} (_see_ Chapter VI., Note 14); this substance\r\n       absorbs CO and gives (NaCO)n (Chapter IX., Note 31), although by\r\n       itself Na does not combine directly with CO (but K does).\r\n\r\nThe most important chemical property of sodium is its power of easily\r\ndecomposing water and _evolving hydrogen_ from the majority of the\r\nhydrogen compounds, and especially from all acids, and hydrates in which\r\nhydroxyl must be recognised. This depends on its power of combining\r\nwith the elements which are in combination with the hydrogen. We\r\nalready know that sodium disengages hydrogen, not only from water,\r\nhydrochloric acid,[44] and all other acids, but also from ammonia,[44 bis]\r\nwith the formation of sodamide NH_{2}Na, although it does not\r\ndisplace hydrogen from the hydrocarbons.[45] Sodium burns both in\r\nchlorine and in oxygen, evolving much heat. These properties are closely\r\nconnected with its power of taking up oxygen, chlorine, and similar\r\nelements from most of their compounds. Just as it removes the oxygen\r\nfrom the oxides of nitrogen and from carbonic anhydride, so also does\r\nit decompose the majority of oxides at definite temperatures. Here the\r\naction is essentially the same as in the decomposition of water. Thus,\r\nfor instance, when acting on magnesium chloride the sodium displaces the\r\nmagnesium, and when acting on aluminium chloride it displaces metallic\r\naluminium. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and a whole series of other\r\nelements, also combine with sodium.[46]\r\n\r\n  [44] H. A. Schmidt remarked that perfectly dry hydrogen chloride is\r\n       decomposed with great difficulty by sodium, although the\r\n       decomposition proceeds easily with potassium and with sodium in\r\n       moist hydrogen chloride. Wanklyn also remarked that sodium burns\r\n       with great difficulty in dry chlorine. Probably these facts are\r\n       related to other phenomena observed by Dixon, who found that\r\n       perfectly dry carbonic oxide does not explode with oxygen on\r\n       passing an electric spark.\r\n\r\n  [44 bis] Sodamide, NH_{2}Na, (Chapter IV., Note 14), discovered by\r\n       Gay-Lussac and Thénard, has formed the object of repeated\r\n       research, but has been most fully investigated by A. W. Titherley\r\n       (1894). Until recently the following was all that was known about\r\n       this compound:--\r\n\r\n       By heating sodium in dry ammonia, Gay-Lussac and Thénard obtained\r\n       an olive-green, easily-fusible mass, _sodamide_, NH_{2}Na,\r\n       hydrogen being separated. This substance with water forms sodium\r\n       hydroxide and ammonia; with carbonic oxide, CO, it forms sodium\r\n       cyanide, NaCN, and water, H_{2}O; and with dry hydrogen chloride\r\n       it forms sodium and ammonium chlorides. These and other reactions\r\n       of sodamide show that the metal in it preserves its energetic\r\n       properties in reaction, and that this compound of sodium is more\r\n       stable than the corresponding chlorine amide. When heated,\r\n       sodamide, NH_{2}Na, only partially decomposes, with evolution of\r\n       hydrogen, the principal part of it giving ammonia and sodium\r\n       nitride, Na_{3}N, according to the equation 3NH_{2}Na = 2NH_{3} +\r\n       NNa_{3}. The latter is an almost black powdery mass, decomposed by\r\n       water into ammonia and sodium hydroxide.\r\n\r\n       Titherley's researches added the following data:--\r\n\r\n       Iron or silver vessels should be used in preparing this body,\r\n       because glass and porcelain are corroded at 300°-400°, at which\r\n       temperature ammonia gas acts upon sodium and forms the amide with\r\n       the evolution of hydrogen. The reaction proceeds slowly, but is\r\n       complete if there be an excess of NH_{3}. Pure NH_{2}Na is\r\n       colourless (its colouration is due to various impurities),\r\n       semi-transparent, shows traces of crystallisation, has a\r\n       conchoidal fracture, and melts at 145°. Judging from the increase\r\n       in weight of the sodium and the quantity of hydrogen which is\r\n       disengaged, the composition of the amide is exactly NH_{2}Na. It\r\n       partially volatilises (sublimes) in vacuo at 200°, and breaks up\r\n       into 2Na + N_{2} + 2H_{2} at 500°. The same amide is formed when\r\n       oxide of sodium is heated in NH_{3}: Na_{2}O + 2NH_{3} = 2NaH_{2}N\r\n       + H_{2}O. NaHO is also formed to some extent by the resultant\r\n       H_{2}O. Potassium and lithium form similar amides. With water,\r\n       alcohol, and acids, NH_{2}Na gives NH_{3} and NaHO, which react\r\n       further. Anhydrous CaO absorbs NH_{2}Na when heated without\r\n       decomposing it. When sodamide is heated with SiO_{2}, NH_{3} is\r\n       disengaged, and silicon nitride formed. It acts still more readily\r\n       upon boric anhydride when heated with it: 2NH_{2}Na + B_{2}O_{3} =\r\n       2BN + 2NaHO + H_{2}O. When slightly heated, NH_{2}Na + NOCl = NaCl\r\n       + N_{2} + H_{2}O (NHNa_{2} and NNa_{3} are apparently not formed\r\n       at a higher temperature). The halogen organic compounds react with\r\n       the aid of heat, but with so much energy that the reaction\r\n       frequently leads to the ultimate destruction of the organic groups\r\n       and production of carbon.\r\n\r\n  [45] As sodium does not displace hydrogen from the hydrocarbons, _it\r\n       may be preserved_ in liquid hydrocarbons. Naphtha is generally\r\n       used for this purpose, as it consists of a mixture of various\r\n       liquid hydrocarbons. However, in naphtha sodium usually becomes\r\n       coated with a crust composed of matter produced by the action of\r\n       the sodium on certain of the substances contained in the mixture\r\n       composing naphtha. In order that sodium may retain its lustre in\r\n       naphtha, secondary octyl alcohol is added. (This alcohol is\r\n       obtained by distilling castor oil with caustic potash.) Sodium\r\n       keeps well in a mixture of pure benzene and paraffin.\r\n\r\n  [46] If sodium does not directly displace the hydrogen in hydrocarbons,\r\n       still by indirect means compounds may be obtained which contain\r\n       sodium and hydrocarbon groups. Some of these compounds have been\r\n       produced, although not in a pure state. Thus, for instance, zinc\r\n       ethyl, Zn(C_{2}H_{5})_{2}, when treated with sodium, loses zinc\r\n       and forms sodium ethyl, C_{2}H_{5}Na, but this decomposition is\r\n       not complete, and the compound formed cannot be separated by\r\n       distillation from the remaining zinc ethyl. In this compound the\r\n       energy of the sodium is clearly manifest, for it reacts with\r\n       substances containing haloids, oxygen, &c., and directly absorbs\r\n       carbonic anhydride, forming a salt of a carboxylic acid\r\n       (propionic).\r\n\r\nWith _oxygen_ sodium unites in three degrees of combination, forming\r\na suboxide Na_{4}O,[46 bis] an oxide, Na_{2}O, and a peroxide, NaO.\r\nThey are thus termed because Na_{2}O is a stable basic oxide (with\r\nwater it forms a basic hydroxide), whilst Na_{4}O and NaO do not\r\nform corresponding saline hydrates and salts. The suboxide is a grey\r\ninflammable substance which easily decomposes water, disengaging\r\nhydrogen; it is formed by the slow oxidation of sodium at the ordinary\r\ntemperature. The peroxide is a greenish yellow substance, fusing at\r\na bright red heat; it is produced by burning sodium in an excess of\r\noxygen, and it yields oxygen when treated with water:\r\n\r\n             Suboxide: Na_{4}O + 3H_{2}O = 4NaHO + H_{2}[47]\r\n                Oxide: Na_{2}O + H_{2}O  = 2NaHO[48]\r\n             Peroxide: Na_{2}O_{2} + H_{2}O = 2NaHO + O[49]\r\n\r\nAll three oxides form sodium hydroxide with water, but only the oxide\r\nNa_{2}O is directly transformed into a hydrate. The other oxides liberate\r\neither hydrogen or oxygen; they also present a similar distinction with\r\nreference to many other agents. Thus carbonic anhydride combines directly\r\nwith the oxide Na_{2}O, which when heated in the gas burns, forming\r\nsodium carbonate, whilst the peroxide yields oxygen in addition. When\r\ntreated with acids, sodium and all its oxides only form the salts\r\ncorresponding with sodium oxide--that is, of the formula or type NaX.\r\nThus the oxide of sodium, Na_{2}O, is _the only salt-forming oxide_ of\r\nthis metal, as water is in the case of hydrogen. Although the peroxide\r\nH_{2}O_{2} is derived from hydrogen, and Na_{2}O_{2} from sodium, yet\r\nthere are no corresponding salts known, and if they are formed they are\r\nprobably as unstable as hydrogen peroxide. Although carbon forms carbonic\r\noxide, CO, still it has only one salt-forming oxide--carbonic anhydride,\r\nCO_{2}. Nitrogen and chlorine both give several salt-forming oxides and\r\ntypes of salts. But of the oxides of nitrogen, NO and NO_{2} do not form\r\nsalts, as do N_{2}O_{3}, N_{2}O_{4}, and N_{2}O_{5}, although N_{2}O_{4}\r\ndoes not form special salts, and N_{2}O_{5} corresponds with the highest\r\nform of the saline compounds of nitrogen. Such distinctions between the\r\nelements, according to their power of giving one or several saline forms,\r\nis a radical property of no less importance than the basic or acid\r\nproperties of their oxides. Sodium as a typical metal does not form any\r\nacid oxides, whilst chlorine, as a typical non-metal, does not form bases\r\nwith oxygen. Therefore sodium _as an element_ may be thus characterised:\r\nit forms one very stable salt-forming oxide, Na_{2}O, having powerful\r\nbasic properties, and its salts are of the general formula, NaX,\r\ntherefore in its compounds it is, like hydrogen, a basic and univalent\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n  [46 bis] It is even doubtful whether the suboxide exists\r\n           (_see_ Note 47).\r\n\r\n  [47] A compound, Na_{2}Cl, which corresponds with the suboxide, is\r\n       apparently formed when a galvanic current is passed through fused\r\n       common salt; the sodium liberated dissolves in the common salt,\r\n       and does not separate from the compound either on cooling or on\r\n       treatment with mercury. It is therefore supposed to be Na_{2}Cl;\r\n       the more so as the mass obtained gives hydrogen when treated with\r\n       water: Na_{2}Cl + H_{2}O = H + NaHO + NaCl, that is, it acts like\r\n       suboxide of sodium. If Na_{2}Cl really exists as a salt, then the\r\n       corresponding base Na_{4}O, according to the rule with other bases\r\n       of the composition M_{4}O, ought to be called a quaternary oxide.\r\n       According to certain evidence, a suboxide is formed when thin\r\n       sheets or fine drops of sodium slowly oxidise in moist air.\r\n\r\n  [48] According to observations easily made, sodium when fused in air\r\n       oxidises but does not burn, the combustion only commencing with\r\n       the formation of vapour--that is, when considerably heated. Davy\r\n       and Karsten obtained the oxides of potassium, K_{2}O, and of\r\n       sodium, Na_{2}O, by heating the metals with their hydroxides,\r\n       whence NaHO + Na = Na_{2}O + H, but N. N. Beketoff failed to\r\n       obtain oxides by this means. He prepared them by directly igniting\r\n       the metals in dry air, and afterwards heating with the metal in\r\n       order to destroy any peroxide. The oxide produced, Na_{2}O, when\r\n       heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen, gave a mixture of sodium and\r\n       its hydroxide: Na_{2}O + H = NaHO + Na (_see_ Chapter II., Note\r\n       9). If both the observations mentioned are accurate, then the\r\n       reaction is reversible. Sodium oxide ought to be formed during the\r\n       decomposition of sodium carbonate by oxide of iron (_see_ Note\r\n       26), and during the decomposition of sodium nitrite. According to\r\n       Karsten, its specific gravity is 2·8, according to Beketoff 2·3.\r\n       The difficulty in obtaining it is owing to an excess of sodium\r\n       forming the suboxide, and an excess of oxygen the peroxide. The\r\n       grey colour peculiar to the suboxide and oxide perhaps shows that\r\n       they contain metallic sodium. In addition to this, in the presence\r\n       of water it may contain sodium hydride and NaHO.\r\n\r\n  [49] Of the oxides of sodium, that easiest to form is the peroxide, NaO\r\n       or Na_{2}O_{2}; this is obtained when sodium is burnt in an excess\r\n       of oxygen. If NaNO_{3} be melted, it gives Na_{2}O_{2} with\r\n       metallic Na. In a fused state the peroxide is reddish yellow, but\r\n       it becomes almost colourless when cold. When heated with iodine\r\n       vapour, it loses oxygen: Na_{2}O_{2} +I_{2} = Na_{2}OI_{2} + O.\r\n       The compound Na_{2}OI_{2} is akin to the compound Cu_{2}OCl_{2}\r\n       obtained by oxidising CuCl. This reaction is one of the few in\r\n       which iodine directly displaces oxygen. The substance Na_{2}OI_{2}\r\n       is soluble in water, and when acidified gives free iodine and a\r\n       sodium salt. Carbonic oxide is absorbed by heated sodium peroxide\r\n       with formation of sodium carbonate: Na_{2}CO_{3} = Na_{2}O_{2} +\r\n       CO, whilst carbonic anhydride liberates oxygen from it. With\r\n       nitrous oxide it reacts thus: Na_{2}O_{2} +2N_{2}O = 2NaNO_{2}\r\n       +N_{2}; with nitric oxide it combines directly, forming sodium\r\n       nitrite, NaO + NO = NaNO_{2}. Sodium peroxide, when treated with\r\n       water, does not give hydrogen peroxide, because the latter in the\r\n       presence of the alkali formed (Na_{2}O_{2}+ 2H_{2}O = 2NaHO +\r\n       H_{2}O_{2}) decomposes into water and oxygen. In the presence of\r\n       dilute sulphuric acid it forms H_{2}O_{2} (Na_{2}O_{2} +\r\n       H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O_{2}). Peroxide of sodium is\r\n       now prepared on a large scale (by the action of air upon Na at\r\n       300°) for bleaching wool, silk &c. (when it acts in virtue of the\r\n       H_{2}O_{2} formed). The oxidising properties of Na_{2}O_{2} under\r\n       the action of heat are seen, for instance, in the fact that when\r\n       heated with I it forms sodium iodate; with PbO, Na_{2}PbO_{3};\r\n       with pyrites, sulphates, &c. When peroxide of sodium comes into\r\n       contact with water, it evolves much heat, forming H_{2}O_{2}, and\r\n       decomposing with the disengagement of oxygen; but, as a rule,\r\n       there is no explosion. But if Na_{2}O_{2} be placed in contact\r\n       with organic matter, such as sawdust, cotton, &c., it gives a\r\n       violent explosion when heated, ignited, or acted on by water.\r\n       Peroxide of sodium forms an excellent oxidising agent for the\r\n       preparation of the higher product of oxidation of Mn, Cr, W, &c.,\r\n       and also for oxidising the metallic sulphides. It should therefore\r\n       find many applications in chemical analysis. To prepare\r\n       Na_{2}O_{2} on a large scale, Castner melts Na in an aluminium\r\n       vessel, and at 300° passes first air deprived of a portion of its\r\n       oxygen (having been already once used), and then ordinary dry air\r\n       over it.\r\n\r\nOn comparing sodium and its analogues, which will be described later\r\nwith other metallic elements, it will be seen that these properties,\r\ntogether with the relative lightness of the metal itself and its\r\ncompounds, and the magnitude of its atomic weight comprise the most\r\nessential properties of this element, clearly distinguishing it from\r\nothers, and enabling us easily to recognise its analogues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n       POTASSIUM, RUBIDIUM, CÆSIUM, AND LITHIUM. SPECTRUM ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as the series of halogens, fluorine, bromine and iodine correspond\r\nwith the chlorine contained in common salt, so also there exists a\r\ncorresponding series of elements: lithium, Li = 7, potassium, K = 39,\r\nrubidium, Rb = 85, and cæsium, Cs = 133, which are analogous to the\r\nsodium in common salt. These elements bear as great a resemblance to\r\nsodium, Na = 23, as fluorine, F = 19, bromine, Br = 80, and iodine, I =\r\n127, do to chlorine, Cl = 35·5. Indeed, in a free state, these elements,\r\nlike sodium, are soft metals which rapidly oxidise in moist air and\r\ndecompose water at the ordinary temperature, forming soluble hydroxides\r\nhaving clearly-defined basic properties and the composition RHO, like\r\nthat of caustic soda. The resemblance between these metals is sometimes\r\nseen with striking clearness, especially in compounds such as salts.[1]\r\nThe corresponding salts of nitric, sulphuric, carbonic, and nearly all\r\nacids with these metals have many points in common. The metals which\r\nresemble sodium so much in their reactions are termed the _metals of the\r\nalkalis_.\r\n\r\n  [1] Tutton's researches (1894) upon the analogy of the crystalline\r\n       forms of K_{2}SO_{4}, Rb_{2}SO_{4} and Cs_{2}SO_{4} may be taken\r\n      as a typical example of the comparison of analogous compounds. We\r\n      cite the following data from these excellent researches: the sp.\r\n      gr. at 20°/4° of K_{2}SO_{4} is 2·6633 of Rb_{2}SO_{4}, 3·6113, and\r\n      of Cs_{2}SO_{4}, 4·2434. The coefficient of cubical expansion (the\r\n      mean between 20° and 60°) for the K salt is 0·0053, for the Rb salt\r\n      0·0052, for the Cs salt 0·0051. The linear expansion (the maximum\r\n      for the vertical axis) along the axis of crystallisation is the\r\n      same for all three salts, within the limits of experimental error.\r\n      The replacement of potassium by rubidium causes the distance\r\n      between the centres of the molecules in the direction of the three\r\n      axes of crystallisation to increase equally, and less than with the\r\n      replacement of rubidium by cæsium. The index of refraction for all\r\n      rays and for every crystalline path (direction) is greater for the\r\n      rubidium salt than for the potassium salt, and less than for the\r\n      cæsium salt, and the differences are nearly in the ratio 2 : 5. The\r\n      lengths of the rhombic crystalline axes for K_{2}SO_{4} are in the\r\n      ratio 0·5727 : 1 : 0·7418, for Rb_{2}SO_{4}, 0·5723 : 1 : 0·7485,\r\n      and for Cs_{2}SO_{4}, 0·5712 : 1 : 0·7521. The development of the\r\n      basic and brachy-pinacoids gradually increases in passing from K to\r\n      Rb and Cs. The optical properties also follow the same order both\r\n      at the ordinary and at a higher temperature. Tutton draws the\r\n      general conclusion that the crystallographic properties of the\r\n      isomorphic rhombic sulphates R_{2}SO_{4} are a function of the\r\n      atomic weight of the metals contained in them (_see_ Chapter XV.)\r\n      Such researches as these should do much towards hastening the\r\n      establishment of a true molecular mechanics of physico-chemical\r\n      phenomena.\r\n\r\nAmong the metals of the alkalis, the most widely distributed in nature,\r\nafter sodium, is _potassium_. Like sodium, it does not appear either in\r\na free state or as oxide or hydroxide, but in the form of salts, which\r\npresent much in common with the salts of sodium in the manner of their\r\noccurrence. The compounds of potassium and sodium in the earth's crust\r\noccur as mineral compounds of silica. With silica, SiO_{2}, potassium\r\noxide, like sodium oxide, forms saline mineral substances resembling\r\nglass. If other oxides, such as lime, CaO, and alumina, Al_{2}O_{3},\r\ncombine with these compounds, glass is formed, a vitreous stony mass,\r\ndistinguished by its great stability, and its very slight variation\r\nunder the action of water. It is such complex silicious compounds as\r\nthese which contain potash (potassium oxide), K_{2}O, or soda (sodium\r\noxide), Na_{2}O, and sometimes both together, silica, SiO_{2}, lime,\r\nCaO, alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}, and other oxides, that form the chief mass\r\nof rocks, out of which, judging by the direction of the strata, the\r\nchief mass of the accessible crust (envelope) of the earth is made up.\r\nThe primary rocks, like granite, porphyry, &c.,[1 bis] are formed of\r\nsuch crystalline silicious rocks as these. The oxides entering into the\r\ncomposition of these rocks do not form a homogeneous amorphous mass\r\nlike glass, but are distributed in a series of peculiar, and in the\r\nmajority of cases crystalline, compounds, into which the primary rocks\r\nmay be divided. Thus a felspar (orthoclase) in granite contains from\r\n8 to 15 per cent. of potassium, whilst another variety (plagioclase)\r\nwhich also occurs in granite contains 1·2 to 6 per cent. of potassium,\r\nand 6 to 12 per cent. of sodium. The mica in granite contains 3 to 10\r\nper cent. of potassium. As already mentioned, and further explained in\r\nChapter XVII., the friable, crumbling, and stratified formations which\r\nin our times cover a large part of the earth's surface have been formed\r\nfrom these primary rocks by the action of the atmosphere and of water\r\ncontaining carbonic acid. It is evident that in the chemical alteration\r\nof the primary rocks by the action of water, the compounds of potassium,\r\nas well as the compounds of sodium, must have been dissolved by the\r\nwater (as they are soluble in water), and that therefore the compounds\r\nof potassium must be accumulated together with those of sodium in sea\r\nwater. And indeed compounds of potassium are always found in _sea\r\nwater_, as we have already pointed out (Chapters I. and X.). This forms\r\none of the sources from which they are extracted. After the evaporation\r\nof sea water, there remains a mother liquor, which contains potassium\r\nchloride and a large proportion of magnesium chloride. On cooling this\r\nsolution crystals separate out which contain chlorides of magnesium\r\nand potassium. A double salt of this kind, called _carnallite_,\r\nKMgCl_{3},6H_{2}O, occurs at Stassfurt. This carnallite[2] is now\r\nemployed as a material for the extraction of potassium chloride, and\r\nof all the compounds of this element.[3] Besides which, potassium\r\nchloride itself is sometimes found at Stassfurt as _sylvine_.[3 bis]\r\nBy a method of double saline decomposition, the chloride of potassium\r\nmay be converted into all the other potassium salts,[4] some of which\r\nare of practical use. The potassium salts have, however, their greatest\r\nimportance as an indispensable component of the food of plants.[5]\r\n\r\n  [1 bis] The origin of the primary rocks has been mentioned in\r\n      Chapter X., Note 2.\r\n\r\n  [2] Carnallite belongs to the number of double salts which are directly\r\n      decomposed by water, and it only crystallises from solutions which\r\n      contain an excess of magnesium chloride. It may be prepared\r\n      artificially by mixing strong solutions of potassium and magnesium\r\n      chlorides, when colourless crystals of sp. gr. 1·60 separate,\r\n      whilst the Stassfurt salt is usually of a reddish tint, owing to\r\n      traces of iron. At the ordinary temperature sixty-five parts of\r\n      carnallite are soluble in one hundred parts of water in the\r\n      presence of an excess of the salt. It deliquesces in the air,\r\n      forming a solution of magnesium chloride and leaving potassium\r\n      chloride. The quantity of carnallite produced at Stassfurt is now\r\n      as much as 100,000 tons a year.\r\n\r\n  [3] The method of separating sodium chloride from potassium chloride\r\n      has been described in Chapter I. On evaporation of a mixture of the\r\n      saturated solutions, sodium chloride separates; and then, on\r\n      cooling, potassium chloride separates, owing to the difference of\r\n      rate of variation of their solubilities with the temperature. The\r\n      following are the most trustworthy figures for the solubility of\r\n      _potassium chloride_ in one hundred parts of water (for sodium\r\n      chloride, _see_ Chapter X., Note 13):--\r\n\r\n                      10°   20°   40°   60°   100°\r\n                      32    35    40    46     57\r\n\r\n      When mixed with solutions of other salts the solubility of\r\n      potassium chloride naturally varies, but not to any great extent.\r\n\r\n  [3 bis] The specific gravity of the solid salt is 1·99--that is, less\r\n      than that of sodium chloride. All the salts of sodium are\r\n      specifically heavier than the corresponding salts of potassium, as\r\n      are also their solutions for equal percentage compositions. If the\r\n      specific gravity of water at 4° = 10,000, then at 15° the specific\r\n      gravity of a solution of _p_ p.c. potassium chloride = 9,992 +\r\n      63·29_p_ + 0·226_p_^2, and therefore for 10 p.c. = 1·0647, 20 p.c.\r\n      = 1·1348, &c.\r\n\r\n      Potassium chloride combines with iodine trichloride to form a\r\n      compound KCl + ICl_{3} = KICl_{4}, which has a yellow colour, is\r\n      fusible, loses iodine trichloride at a red heat, and gives\r\n      potassium iodate and hydrochloric acid with water. It is not only\r\n      formed by direct combination, but also by many other methods; for\r\n      instance, by passing chlorine into a solution of potassium iodide\r\n      so long as the gas is absorbed, KI + 2Cl_{2} = KCl,ICl_{3}.\r\n      Potassium iodide, when treated with potassium chlorate and strong\r\n      hydrochloric acid, also gives this compound; another method for its\r\n      formation is given by the equation KClO_{3} + I + 6HCl =\r\n      KCl,ICl_{3} + 3Cl + 3H_{2}O. This is a kind of salt corresponding\r\n      with KIO_{2} (unknown) in which the oxygen is replaced by chlorine.\r\n      If valency be taken as the starting-point in the study of chemical\r\n      compounds, and the elements considered as having a constant\r\n      atomicity (number of bonds)--that is, if K, Cl, and I be taken as\r\n      univalent elements--then it is impossible to explain the formation\r\n      of such a compound because, according to this view, univalent\r\n      elements are only able to form dual compounds with each other; such\r\n      as, KCl, ClI, KI, &c., whilst here they are grouped together in the\r\n      molecule KICl_{4}. Wells, Wheeler, and Penfield (1892) obtained a\r\n      large number of such poly-haloid salts. They may all be divided\r\n      into two large classes: the tri-haloid and the penta-haloid salts.\r\n      They have been obtained not only for K but also for Rb and Cs, and\r\n      partially also for Na and Li. The general method of their formation\r\n      consists in dissolving the ordinary halogen salt of the metal in\r\n      water, and treating it with the requisite amount of free halogen.\r\n      The poly-haloid salt separates out after evaporating the solution\r\n      at a more or less low temperature. In this manner, among the\r\n      tri-haloid salts, may be obtained: KI_{3}, KBr_{2}I, KCl_{2}I, and\r\n      the corresponding salts of rubidium and cæsium, for instance,\r\n      CsI_{3}, CsBrI_{2}, CsBr_{2}I, CsClBrI,CsCl_{2}I, CsBr_{3},\r\n      CsClBr_{2}, CsCl_{2}Br, and in general MX_{3} where X is a halogen.\r\n      The colour of the crystals varies according to the halogen, thus\r\n      CsI_{3} is black, CrBr_{3} yellowish red, CrBrI_{2} reddish brown,\r\n      CsBr_{2}I red, CsCl_{2}Br yellow. The cæsium salts are the most\r\n      stable, and those of potassium least so, as also those which\r\n      contain Br and I separately or together; for cæsium no compounds\r\n      containing Cl and I were obtained. The penta-haloid salts form a\r\n      smaller class; among these salts potassium forms KCl_{4}I, rubidium\r\n      RbCl_{4}I, cæsium CsI_{5}, CsBr, CsCl_{4}I, lithium LiCl_{4}I (with\r\n      4H_{2}O) and sodium NaCl_{4}I (with 2H_{2}O). The most stable are\r\n      those salts containing the metal with the greatest atomic\r\n      weight--cæsium (_see_ Chapter XI., Note 63).\r\n\r\n  [4] It is possible to extract the compounds of potassium directly from\r\n      the primary rocks which are so widely distributed over the earth's\r\n      surface and so abundant in some localities. From a chemical point\r\n      of view this problem presents no difficulty; for instance, by\r\n      fusing powdered orthoclase with lime and fluor spar (Ward's method)\r\n      and then extracting the alkali with water (on fusion the silica\r\n      gives an insoluble compound with lime), or by treating the\r\n      orthoclase with hydrofluoric acid (in which case silicon fluoride\r\n      is evolved as a gas) it is possible to transfer the alkali of the\r\n      orthoclase to an aqueous solution, and to separate it in this\r\n      manner from the other insoluble oxides. However, as yet there is no\r\n      profit in, nor necessity for, recourse to this treatment, as\r\n      carnallite and potash form abundant materials for the extraction of\r\n      potassium compounds by cheaper methods. Furthermore, the salts of\r\n      potassium are now in the majority of chemical reactions replaced by\r\n      salts of sodium, especially since the preparation of sodium\r\n      carbonate has been facilitated by the Leblanc process. The\r\n      replacement of potassium compounds by sodium compounds not only has\r\n      the advantage that the salts of sodium are in general cheaper than\r\n      those of potassium, but also that a smaller quantity of a sodium\r\n      salt is needed for a given reaction than of a potassium salt,\r\n      because the combining weight of sodium (23) is less than that of\r\n      potassium (39).\r\n\r\n [5] It has been shown by direct experiment on the cultivation of plants\r\n      in artificial soils and in solutions that under conditions\r\n      (physical, chemical, and physiological) otherwise identical plants\r\n      are able to thrive and become fully developed in the entire absence\r\n      of sodium salts, but that their development is impossible without\r\n      potassium salts.\r\n\r\nThe primary rocks contain an almost equal proportion of potassium and\r\nsodium. But in sea water the compounds of the latter metal predominate.\r\nIt may be asked, what became of the compounds of potassium in the\r\ndisintegration of the primary rocks, if so small a quantity went to the\r\nsea water? They remained with the other products of the decomposition\r\nof the primary rocks. When granite or any other similar rock formation\r\nis disintegrated, there are formed, besides the soluble substances,\r\nalso insoluble substances--sand and finely-divided clay, containing\r\nwater, alumina, and silica. This clay is carried away by the water,\r\nand is then deposited in strata. It, and especially its admixture with\r\nvegetable remains, retain compounds of potassium in a greater quantity\r\nthan those of sodium. This has been proved with absolute certainty\r\nto be the case, and is due to the _absorptive power of the soil_. If\r\na dilute solution of a potassium compound be filtered through common\r\nmould used for growing plants, containing clay and the remains of\r\nvegetable decomposition, this mould will be found to have retained a\r\nsomewhat considerable percentage of the potassium compounds. If a salt\r\nof potassium be taken, then during the filtration an equivalent quantity\r\nof a salt of calcium--which is also found, as a rule, in soils--is\r\nset free. Such a process of filtration through finely divided earthy\r\nsubstances proceeds in nature, and the compounds of potassium are\r\neverywhere retained by the friable earth in considerable quantity. This\r\nexplains the presence of so small an amount of potassium salts in the\r\nwater of rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans, where the lime and soda\r\nhave accumulated. The compounds of potassium retained by the friable\r\nmass of the earth are absorbed as an aqueous solution by the roots\r\nof _plants_. Plants, as everyone knows, when burnt leave an ash, and\r\nthis ash, besides various other substances, without exception contains\r\ncompounds of potassium. Many land plants contain a very small amount of\r\nsodium compounds,[6] whilst potassium and its compounds occur in all\r\nkinds of vegetable ash. Among the generally cultivated plants, grass,\r\npotatoes, the turnip, and buckwheat are particularly rich in potassium\r\ncompounds. The ash of plants, and especially of herbaceous plants,\r\nbuckwheat straw, sunflower and potato leaves are used in practice for\r\nthe extraction of potassium compounds. There is no doubt that potassium\r\noccurs in the plants themselves in the form of complex compounds,\r\nand often as salts of organic acids. In certain cases such salts of\r\npotassium are even extracted from the juice of plants. Thus, sorrel\r\nand oxalis, for example, contain in their juices the acid oxalate of\r\npotassium, C_{2}HKO_{4}, which is employed for removing ink stains.\r\nGrape juice contains the so-called cream of tartar, which is the acid\r\ntartrate of potassium, C_{4}H_{5}KO_{6}.[7] This salt also separates\r\nas a sediment from wine. When the plants, containing one or more of the\r\nsalts of potassium, are burnt, the carbonaceous matter is oxidised,\r\nand in consequence the potassium is obtained in the ash as carbonate,\r\nK_{2}CO_{3}, which is generally known as _potashes_. Hence potashes\r\noccur ready prepared in the ash of plants, and therefore the ash of\r\nland plants is employed as a source for the extraction of potassium\r\ncompounds. Potassium carbonate is extracted by lixiviating the ash with\r\nwater.[8] Potassium carbonate may also be obtained from the chloride\r\nby a method similar to that by which sodium carbonate is prepared from\r\nsodium chloride.[8 bis] There is no difficulty in obtaining any salt of\r\npotassium--for example, the sulphate,[9] bromide, and iodide[10]--by\r\nthe action of the corresponding acid on KCl and especially on the\r\ncarbonate, whilst the hydroxide, _caustic potash_, KHO, which is in many\r\nrespects analogous to caustic soda, is easily obtained by means of lime\r\nin exactly the same manner in which sodium hydroxide is prepared from\r\nsodium carbonate.[11] Therefore, in order to complete our knowledge of\r\nthe alkali metals, we will only describe two salts of potassium which\r\nare of practical importance, and whose analogues have not been described\r\nin the preceding chapter, potassium cyanide and potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\n  [6] If herbaceous plants contain much sodium salts, it is evident that\r\n      these salts mainly come from the sodium compounds in the water\r\n      absorbed by the plants.\r\n\r\n  [7] As plants always contain mineral substances and cannot thrive in\r\n      a medium which does not contain them, more especially in one which\r\n      is free from the salts of the four basic oxides, K_{2}O, CaO, MgO,\r\n      and Fe_{2}O_{3}, and of the four acid oxides, CO_{2}, N_{2}O_{5},\r\n      P_{2}O_{5}, and SO_{3}, and as the amount of ash-forming substances\r\n      in plants is small, the question inevitably arises as to what part\r\n      these play in the development of plants. With the existing chemical\r\n      data only one answer is possible to this question, and it is still\r\n      only a hypothesis. This answer was particularly clearly expressed\r\n      by Professor Gustavson of the Petroffsky Agricultural Academy.\r\n      Starting from the fact (Chapter XI., Note 55) that a small quantity\r\n      of aluminium renders possible or facilitates the reaction of\r\n      bromine on hydrocarbons at the ordinary temperature, it is easy to\r\n      arrive at the conclusion, which is very probable and in accordance\r\n      with many data respecting the reactions of organic compounds, that\r\n      the addition of mineral substances to organic compounds lowers the\r\n      temperature of reaction and in general facilitates chemical\r\n      reactions in plants, and thus aids the conversion of the most\r\n      simple nourishing substances into the complex component parts of\r\n      the plant organism. The province of chemical reactions proceeding\r\n      in organic substances in the presence of a small quantity of\r\n      mineral substances has as yet been but little investigated,\r\n      although there are already several disconnected data concerning\r\n      reactions of this kind, and although a great deal is known with\r\n      regard to such reactions among inorganic compounds. The essence of\r\n      the matter may be expressed thus--two substances, A and B, do not\r\n      react on each other of their own accord, but the addition of a\r\n      small quantity of a third particularly active substance, C,\r\n      produces the reaction of A on B, because A combines with C, forming\r\n      AC, and B reacts on this new compound, which has a different store\r\n      of chemical energy, forming the compound AB or its products, and\r\n      setting C free again or retaining it.\r\n\r\n      It may here be remarked that all the mineral substances necessary\r\n      for plants (those enumerated at the beginning of the note) are the\r\n      highest saline compounds of their elements, that they enter into\r\n      the plants as salts, that the lower forms of oxidation of the same\r\n      elements (for instance, sulphites and phosphites) are harmful to\r\n      plants (poisonous), and that strong solutions of the salts\r\n      assimilated by plants (their osmotic pressure being great and\r\n      contracting the cells, as De Vries showed, (_see_ Chapter I., Note\r\n      19)) not only do not enter into the plants but kill them (poison\r\n      them).\r\n\r\n  [8] Besides which, it will be understood from the preceding paragraph\r\n      that the salts of potassium may become exhausted from the soil by\r\n      long cultivation, and that there may therefore be cases when the\r\n      direct fertilisation by salts of potassium may be profitable. But\r\n      manure and animal excrements, ashes, and, in general, nearly all\r\n      refuse which may serve for fertilising the soil, contain a\r\n      considerable quantity of potassium salts, and therefore, as regards\r\n      the natural salts of potassium (Stassfurt), and especially\r\n      potassium sulphate, if they often improve the crops, it is in all\r\n      probability due to their action on the properties of the soil. The\r\n      agriculturist cannot therefore be advised to add potassium salts,\r\n      without making special experiments showing the advantage of such a\r\n      fertiliser on a given kind of soil and plant.\r\n\r\n      The animal body also contains potassium compounds, which is\r\n      natural, since animals consume plants. For example, milk, and\r\n      especially human milk, contains a somewhat considerable quantity of\r\n      potassium compounds. Cow's milk, however, does not contain much\r\n      potassium salt. Sodium compounds generally predominate in the\r\n      bodies of animals. The excrement of animals, and especially of\r\n      herbivorous animals, on the contrary, often contains a large\r\n      proportion of potassium salts. Thus sheep's dung is rich in them,\r\n      and in washing sheep's wool salts of potassium pass into the water.\r\n\r\n      The ash of tree stems, as the already dormant portion of the plant\r\n      (Chapter VIII., Note 1), contains little potash. For the extraction\r\n      of potash, which was formerly carried on extensively in the east of\r\n      Russia (before the discovery of the Stassfurt salt), the ash of\r\n      grasses, and the green portions of potatoes, buckwheat, &c., are\r\n      taken and treated with water (lixiviated), the solution is\r\n      evaporated, and the residue ignited in order to destroy the organic\r\n      matter present in the extract. The residue thus obtained is\r\n      composed of raw potash. It is refined by a second dissolution in a\r\n      small quantity of water, for the potash itself is very soluble in\r\n      water, whilst the impurities are sparingly soluble. The solution\r\n      thus obtained is again evaporated, and the residue ignited, and\r\n      this potash is then called refined potash, or pearlash. This method\r\n      of treatment cannot give chemically pure potassium carbonate. A\r\n      certain amount of impurities remain. To obtain chemically pure\r\n      potassium carbonate, some other salt of potassium is generally\r\n      taken and purified by crystallisation. Potassium carbonate\r\n      crystallises with difficulty, and it cannot therefore be purified\r\n      by this means, whilst other salts, such as the tartrate, acid\r\n      carbonate, sulphate, or nitrate, &c., crystallise easily and may\r\n      thus be directly purified. The tartrate is most frequently\r\n      employed, since it is prepared in large quantities (as a sediment\r\n      from wine) for medicinal use under the name of cream of tartar.\r\n      When ignited without access of air, it leaves a mixture of charcoal\r\n      and potassium carbonate. The charcoal so obtained being in a\r\n      finely-divided condition, the mixture (called 'black flux'), is\r\n      sometimes used for reducing metals from their oxides with the aid\r\n      of heat. A certain quantity of nitre is added to burn the charcoal\r\n      formed by heating the cream of tartar. Potassium carbonate thus\r\n      prepared is further purified by converting it into the acid salt,\r\n      by passing a current of carbonic anhydride through a strong\r\n      solution. KHCO_{3} is then formed, which is less soluble than the\r\n      normal salt (as is also the case with the corresponding sodium\r\n      salts), and therefore crystals of the acid salt separate from the\r\n      solution on cooling. When ignited, they part with their water and\r\n      carbonic anhydride, and pure potassium carbonate remains behind.\r\n      The physical properties of potassium carbonate distinguish it\r\n      sufficiently from sodium carbonate; it is obtained from solutions\r\n      as a powdery white mass, having an alkaline taste and reaction,\r\n      and, as a rule, shows only traces of crystallisation. It also\r\n      attracts the moisture of the air with great energy. The crystals do\r\n      not contain water, but absorb it from the air, deliquescing into a\r\n      saturated solution. It melts at a red heat (1045°), and at a still\r\n      higher temperature is even converted into vapour, as has been\r\n      observed at glass works where it is employed. It is very soluble.\r\n      At the ordinary temperature, water dissolves an equal weight of the\r\n      salt. Crystals containing two equivalents of water separate from\r\n      such a saturated solution when strongly cooled (Morel obtained\r\n      K_{2}CO_{3}3H_{2}O in well-formed crystals at +10°). There is no\r\n      necessity to describe its reactions, because they are all analogous\r\n      to those of sodium carbonate. When manufactured sodium carbonate\r\n      was but little known, the consumption of potassium carbonate was\r\n      very considerable, and even now washing soda is frequently replaced\r\n      for household purposes by 'lye'--_i.e._ an aqueous solution\r\n      obtained from ashes. It contains potassium carbonate, which acts\r\n      like the sodium salt in washing tissues, linen, &c.\r\n\r\n      A mixture of potassium and sodium carbonates fuses with much\r\n      greater ease than the separate salts, and a mixture of their\r\n      solutions gives well-crystallised salts--for instance (Marguerite's\r\n      salt), K_{2}CO_{3},6H_{2}O,2Na_{2}CO_{3},6H_{2}O. Crystallisation\r\n      also occurs in other multiple proportions of K and Na (in the above\r\n      case 1 : 2, but 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 are known), and always with 6 mol.\r\n      H_{2}O. This is evidently a combination _by similarity_, as in\r\n      alloys, solutions, &c.\r\n\r\n  [8 bis] About 25,000 tons of potash annually are now prepared from KCl\r\n      by this method at Stassfurt.\r\n\r\n  [9] _Potassium sulphate_, K_{2}SO_{4}, crystallises from its solutions\r\n      in an anhydrous condition, in which respect it differs from the\r\n      corresponding sodium salt, just as potassium carbonate differs from\r\n      sodium carbonate. In general, it must be observed that the majority\r\n      of sodium salts combine more easily with water of crystallisation\r\n      than the potassium salts. The solubility of _potassium sulphate_\r\n      does not show the same peculiarities as that of sodium sulphate,\r\n      because it does not combine with water of crystallisation; at the\r\n      ordinary temperature 100 parts of water dissolve about 10 parts of\r\n      the salt, at 0° 8·3 parts, and at 100° about 26 parts. _The acid\r\n      sulphate_, KHSO_{4}, obtained easily by heating crystals of the\r\n      normal salt with sulphuric acid, is frequently employed in chemical\r\n      practice. On heating the mixture of acid and salt, fumes of\r\n      sulphuric acid are at first given off; when they cease to be\r\n      evolved, the acid salt is contained in the residue. At a higher\r\n      temperature (of above 600°) the acid salt parts with all the acid\r\n      contained in it, the normal salt being re-formed. The definite\r\n      composition of this acid salt, and the ease with which it\r\n      decomposes, render it exceedingly valuable for certain chemical\r\n      transformations accomplished by means of sulphuric acid at a high\r\n      temperature, because it is possible to take, in the form of this\r\n      salt, a strictly definite quantity of sulphuric acid, and to cause\r\n      it to act on a given substance at a high temperature, which it is\r\n      often necessary to do, more especially in chemical analysis. In\r\n      this case, the acid salt acts in exactly the same manner as\r\n      sulphuric acid itself, but the latter is inefficient at\r\n      temperatures above 400°, because it all evaporates, while at that\r\n      temperature the acid salt still remains in a fused state, and acts\r\n      with the elements of sulphuric acid on the substance taken. Hence\r\n      by its means the boiling-point of sulphuric acid is raised. Thus\r\n      the acid potassium sulphate is employed, where for conversion of\r\n      certain oxides, such as those of iron, aluminium, and chromium,\r\n      into salts, a high temperature is required.\r\n\r\n      Weber, by heating potassium sulphate with an excess of sulphuric\r\n      acid at 100°, observed the formation of a lower stratum, which was\r\n      found to contain a definite compound containing eight equivalents\r\n      of SO_{3} per equivalent of K_{2}O. The salts of rubidium, cæsium,\r\n      and thallium give a similar result, but those of sodium and lithium\r\n      do not. (_See_ Note 1.)\r\n\r\n  [10] The _bromide_ and _iodide_ of potassium are used, like the\r\n       corresponding sodium compounds, in medicine and photography.\r\n       Potassium iodide is easily obtained in a pure state by saturating\r\n       a solution of hydriodic acid with caustic potash. In practice,\r\n       however, this method is rarely had recourse to, other more simple\r\n       processes being employed although they do not give so pure a\r\n       product. They aim at the direct formation of hydriodic acid in the\r\n       liquid in the presence of potassium hydroxide or carbonate. Thus\r\n       iodine is thrown into a solution of pure potash, and hydrogen\r\n       sulphide passed through the mixture, the iodine being thus\r\n       converted into hydriodic acid. Or a solution is prepared from\r\n       phosphorus, iodine, and water, containing hydriodic and phosphoric\r\n       acid; lime is then added to this solution, when calcium iodide is\r\n       obtained in solution, and calcium phosphate as a precipitate. The\r\n       solution of calcium iodide gives, with potassium carbonate,\r\n       insoluble calcium carbonate and a solution of potassium iodide. If\r\n       iodine is added to a slightly-heated solution of caustic potash\r\n       (free from carbonate--that is, freshly prepared), so long as the\r\n       solution is not coloured from the presence of an excess of iodine,\r\n       there is formed (as in the action of chlorine on a solution of\r\n       caustic potash) a mixture of potassium iodide and iodate. On\r\n       evaporating the solution thus obtained and igniting the residue,\r\n       the iodate is destroyed and converted into iodide, the oxygen\r\n       being disengaged, and potassium iodide only is left behind. On\r\n       dissolving the residue in water and then evaporating, cubical\r\n       crystals of the anhydrous salt are obtained, which are soluble in\r\n       water and alcohol, and on fusion give an alkaline reaction, owing\r\n       to the fact that when ignited a portion of the salt decomposes,\r\n       forming potassium oxide. The neutral salt may be obtained by\r\n       adding hydriodic acid to this alkaline salt until it gives an acid\r\n       reaction. It is best to add some finely-divided charcoal to the\r\n       mixture of iodate and iodide before igniting it, as this\r\n       facilitates the evolution of the oxygen from the iodate. The\r\n       iodate may also be converted into iodide by the action of certain\r\n       reducing agents, such as zinc amalgam, which when boiled with a\r\n       solution containing an iodate converts it into iodide. Potassium\r\n       iodide may also be prepared by mixing a solution of ferrous iodide\r\n       (it is best if the solution contain an excess of iodine) and\r\n       potassium carbonate, in which case ferrous carbonate FeCO_{3}, is\r\n       precipitated (with an excess of iodine the precipitate is\r\n       granular, and contains a compound of the suboxide and oxide of\r\n       iron), while potassium iodide remains in solution. Ferrous iodide,\r\n       FeI_{2}, is obtained by the direct action of iodine on iron in\r\n       water. Potassium iodide considerably lowers the temperature (by\r\n       24°), when it dissolves in water, 100 parts of the salt dissolve\r\n       in 73·5 parts of water at 12·5°, in 70 parts at 18°, whilst the\r\n       saturated solution which boils at 120° contains 100 parts of salt\r\n       per 45 parts of water. Solutions of potassium iodide dissolve a\r\n       considerable amount of iodine; strong solutions even dissolving as\r\n       much or more iodine than they contain as potassium iodide (_see_\r\n       Note 3 bis and Chapter XI., Note 64).\r\n\r\n  [11] Caustic potash is not only formed by the action of lime on dilute\r\n       solutions of potassium carbonate (as sodium hydroxide is prepared\r\n       from sodium carbonate), but by igniting potassium nitrate with\r\n       finely-divided copper (_see_ Note 15), and also by mixing\r\n       solutions of potassium sulphate (or even of alum, KAlS_{2}O_{8})\r\n       and barium hydroxide, BaH_{2}O_{2}. It is sometimes purified by\r\n       dissolving it in alcohol (the impurities, for example, potassium\r\n       sulphate and carbonate, are not dissolved) and then evaporating\r\n       the alcohol.\r\n\r\n       The specific gravity of potassium hydroxide is 2·04, but that of\r\n       its solutions (see Chapter XII., Note 18) at 15° S = 9,992 +\r\n       90·4_p_ + 0·28_p_^2 (here _p_^2 is +, and for sodium hydroxide it\r\n       is-). Strong solutions, when cooled, yield a crystallo-hydrate,\r\n       KHO,4H_{2}O, which dissolves in water, producing cold (like\r\n       2NaHO,7H_{2}O), whilst potassium hydroxide in solution develops a\r\n       considerable amount of heat.\r\n\r\n_Potassium cyanide_, which presents in its chemical relations a certain\r\nanalogy with the halogen salts of potassium, is not only formed\r\naccording to the equation, KHO + HCN = H_{2}O + KCN, but also whenever\r\na nitrogenous carbon compound--for instance, animal matter--is heated\r\nin the presence of metallic potassium, or of a compound of potassium,\r\nand even when a mixture of potash and carbon is heated in a stream of\r\nnitrogen. Potassium cyanide is obtained from yellow prussiate, which\r\nhas been already mentioned in Chapter IX., and whose preparation\r\non a large scale will be described in Chapter XXII. If the yellow\r\nprussiate be ground to a powder and dried, so that it loses its water\r\nof crystallisation, it then melts at a red heat, and decomposes into\r\ncarbide of iron, nitrogen, and potassium cyanide, FeK_{4}C_{6}N_{6} =\r\n4KCN + FeC_{2} + N_{2}. After the decomposition it is found that the\r\nyellow salt has been converted into a white mass of potassium cyanide.\r\nThe carbide of iron formed collects at the bottom of the vessel. If\r\nthe mass thus obtained be treated with water, the potassium cyanide is\r\npartially decomposed by the water, but if it be treated with alcohol,\r\nthen the cyanide is dissolved, and on cooling separates in a crystalline\r\nform.[12] A solution of potassium cyanide has a powerfully alkaline\r\nreaction, a smell like that of bitter almonds, peculiar to prussic acid,\r\nand acts as a most powerful poison. Although exceedingly stable in a\r\nfused state, potassium cyanide easily changes when in solution. Prussic\r\nacid is so very feebly energetic that even water decomposes potassium\r\ncyanide. A solution of the salt, even without access of air, easily\r\nturns brown and decomposes, and when heated evolves ammonia and forms\r\npotassium formate; this is easily comprehensible from the representation\r\nof the cyanogen compounds which was developed in Chapter IX., KCN +\r\n2H_{2}O = CHKO_{2} + NH_{3}. Furthermore, as carbonic anhydride acts on\r\npotassium cyanide with evolution of prussic acid, and as potassium\r\ncyanate, which is also unstable, is formed by the action of air, it will\r\nbe easily seen that solutions of potassium cyanide are very unstable.\r\nPotassium cyanide, containing as it does carbon and potassium, is a\r\nsubstance which can act in a very vigorously reducing manner, especially\r\nwhen fused; it is therefore used as a powerful reducing agent at a red\r\nheat.[13] The property of potassium cyanide of giving double salts\r\nwith other cyanides is very clearly shown by the fact that many metals\r\ndissolve in a solution of potassium cyanide, with the evolution of\r\nhydrogen. For example, iron, copper, and zinc act in this manner. Thus--\r\n\r\n          4KCN + 2H_{2}O + Zn = K_{2}ZnC_{4}N_{4} + 2KHO + H_{2}\r\n\r\n  [12] When the yellow prussiate is heated to redness, all the cyanogen\r\n       which was in combination with the iron is decomposed into\r\n       nitrogen, which is evolved as gas, and carbon, which combines with\r\n       the iron. In order to avoid this, potassium carbonate is added to\r\n       the yellow prussiate while it is being fused. A mixture of 8 parts\r\n       of anhydrous yellow prussiate and 3 parts of pure potassium\r\n       carbonate is generally taken. Double decomposition then takes\r\n       place, resulting in the formation of ferrous carbonate and\r\n       potassium cyanide. But by this method, as by the first, a pure\r\n       salt is not obtained, because a portion of the potassium cyanide\r\n       is oxidised at the expense of the iron carbonate and forms\r\n       potassium cyanate, FeCO_{3} + KCN = CO_{2} + Fe + KCNO; and the\r\n       potassium cyanide very easily forms oxide, which acts on the sides\r\n       of the vessel in which the mixture is heated (to avoid this iron\r\n       vessels should be used). By adding one part of charcoal powder to\r\n       the mixture of 8 parts of anhydrous yellow prussiate and 3 parts\r\n       of potassium carbonate a mass is obtained which is free from\r\n       cyanate, because the carbon absorbs the oxygen, but in that case\r\n       it is impossible to obtain a colourless potassium cyanide by\r\n       simple fusion, although this may be easily done by dissolving it\r\n       in alcohol. Cyanide of potassium may also be obtained from\r\n       potassium thiocyanate, which is formed from ammonium thiocyanate\r\n       obtained by the action of ammonia upon bisulphide of carbon (_see_\r\n       works upon Organic Chemistry). Potassium cyanide is now prepared\r\n       in large quantities from yellow prussiate for gilding and\r\n       silvering. When fused in large quantities the action of the oxygen\r\n       of the air is limited, and with great care the operation may be\r\n       successfully conducted, and therefore, on a large scale, very pure\r\n       salt is sometimes obtained. When slowly cooled, the fused salt\r\n       separates in cubical crystals like potassium chloride.\r\n\r\n       Pure KCN is obtained by passing CNH gas into an alcoholic solution\r\n       of KHO. The large amount of potassium cyanide which is now\r\n       required for the extraction of gold from its ores, is being\r\n       replaced by a mixture (Rossler and Gasslaker, 1892) of KCN and\r\n       NaCN, prepared by heating powdered and dried yellow prussiate with\r\n       metallic sodium: K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6} + 2Na = 4KCN + 2NaCN + Fe. This\r\n       method offers two advantages over the above methods: (1) the whole\r\n       of the cyanide is obtained, and does not decompose with the\r\n       formation of N_{2}; and (2) no cyanates are formed, as is the case\r\n       when carbonate of potash is heated with the prussiate.\r\n\r\n  [13] A considerable quantity of potassium cyanide is used in the arts,\r\n       more particularly for the preparation of metallic solutions which\r\n       are decomposed by the action of a galvanic current; thus it is\r\n       very frequently employed in electro-silvering and gilding. An\r\n       alkaline solution is prepared, which is moderately stable owing to\r\n       the fact that potassium cyanide in the form of certain double\r\n       salts--that is, combined with other cyanides--is far more stable\r\n       than when alone (yellow prussiate, which contains potassium\r\n       cyanide in combination with ferrous cyanide, is an example of\r\n       this).\r\n\r\nGold and silver are soluble in potassium cyanide in the presence of air,\r\nin which case the hydrogen, which would otherwise be evolved in the\r\nreaction, combines with the oxygen of the air, forming water (Eissler,\r\nMacLaurin, 1893), for example, 4Au + 4KCN + O + H_{2}O = 2AuKC_{2}N_{2}\r\n+ 2KHO, which is taken advantage of for extracting gold from its ores\r\n(Chapter XXIV.).[13 bis] Platinum, mercury, and tin are not dissolved in\r\na solution of potassium cyanide, even with access of air.\r\n\r\n  [13 bis] A dilute solution of KCN is taken, not containing more than\r\n       1 per cent. KCN. MacLaurin explains this by the fact that strong\r\n       solutions dissolve gold less rapidly, owing to their dissolving\r\n       less air, whose oxygen is necessary for the reaction.\r\n\r\n_Potassium nitrate_, or common _nitre_ or _saltpetre_, KNO_{3}, is\r\nchiefly used as a component part of gunpowder, in which it cannot be\r\nreplaced by the sodium salt, because the latter is deliquescent. It\r\nis necessary that the nitre in gunpowder should be perfectly pure, as\r\neven small traces of sodium, magnesium, and calcium salts, especially\r\nchlorides, render the nitre and the gunpowder capable of attracting\r\nmoisture. Nitre may easily be obtained pure, owing to its great\r\ndisposition to form crystals both large and small, which aids its\r\nseparation from other salts. The considerable differences between the\r\nsolubility of nitre at different temperatures aids this crystallisation.\r\nA solution of nitre saturated at its boiling point (116°) contains\r\n335 parts of nitre to 100 parts of water, whilst at the ordinary\r\ntemperature--for instance, 20°--the solution is only able to retain 32\r\nparts of the salt. Therefore, in the preparation and refining of nitre,\r\nits solution, saturated at the boiling point, is cooled, and nearly\r\nall the nitre is obtained in the form of crystals. If the solution be\r\nquietly and slowly cooled in large quantities then large crystals are\r\nformed, but if it be rapidly cooled and agitated then small crystals are\r\nobtained. In this manner, if not all, at all events the majority, of\r\nthe impurities present in small quantities remain in the mother liquor.\r\nIf an unsaturated solution of nitre be rapidly cooled, so as to prevent\r\nthe formation of large crystals (in whose crevices the mother liquor,\r\ntogether with the impurities, would remain), the very minute crystals of\r\nnitre known as saltpetre flour are obtained.\r\n\r\nCommon nitre occurs in nature, but only in small quantities in admixture\r\nwith other nitrates, and especially with sodium, magnesium, and calcium\r\nnitrates. Such a mixture of salts of nitric acid is formed in nature\r\nin fertile earth, and in those localities where, as in _the soil_,\r\nnitrogenous organic remains are decomposed in the presence of alkalis or\r\nalkaline bases with free access of air. This method of the formation of\r\nnitrates requires moisture, besides the free access of air, and takes\r\nplace principally during warm weather.[14] In warm countries, and in\r\ntemperate climates during the summer months, fertile soils produce a\r\nsmall quantity of nitre. In this respect India is especially known as\r\naffording a considerable supply of nitre extracted from the soil. The\r\nnitre-bearing soil after the rainy season sometimes becomes covered\r\nduring the summer with crystals of nitre, formed by the evaporation of\r\nthe water in which it was previously dissolved. This soil is collected,\r\nsubjected to repeated lixiviations, and treated for nitre as will be\r\npresently described. In temperate climates nitrates are obtained from\r\nthe lime rubbish of demolished buildings which have stood for many\r\nyears, and especially from those portions which have been in contact\r\nwith the ground. The conditions there are very favourable for the\r\nformation of nitre, because the lime used as a cement in buildings\r\ncontains the base necessary for the formation of nitrates, while the\r\nexcrement, urine, and animal refuse are sources of nitrogen. By the\r\nmethodical lixiviation of this kind of rubbish a solution of nitrogenous\r\nsalts is formed similar to that obtained by the lixiviation of fertile\r\nsoil. A similar solution is also obtained by the lixiviation of the\r\nso-called _nitre plantations_. They are composed of manure interlaid\r\nwith brushwood, and strewn over with ashes, lime, and other alkaline\r\nrubbish. These nitre plantations are set up in those localities where\r\nthe manure is not required for the fertilisation of the soil, as, for\r\nexample, in the south-eastern 'black earth' Governments of Russia.\r\nThe same process of oxidation of nitrogenous matter freely exposed to\r\nair and moisture during the warm season in the presence of alkalis\r\ntakes place in nitre plantations as in fertile soil and in the walls\r\nof buildings. From all these sources there is obtained a solution\r\ncontaining various salts of nitric acid mixed with soluble organic\r\nmatter. The simplest method of treating this impure solution of nitre\r\nis to add a solution of potassium carbonate, or to simply treat it with\r\nashes containing this substance. The potassium carbonate enters into\r\ndouble decomposition with the calcium and magnesium salts, forming\r\ninsoluble carbonates of these bases and leaving the nitre in solution.\r\nThus, for instance, K_{2}CO_{3} + Ca(NO_{3})_{2} = 2KNO_3 + CaCO_{3}.\r\nBoth calcium and magnesium carbonates are insoluble, and therefore after\r\ntreatment with potassium carbonate the solution no longer contains salts\r\nof these metals but only the salts of sodium and potassium together with\r\norganic matter. The latter partially separates on heating in an insoluble\r\nform, and is entirely destroyed by heating the nitre to a low red heat.\r\nThe nitre thus obtained is easily purified by repeated crystallisation.\r\nThe greater part of the nitre used for making gunpowder is now obtained\r\nfrom the sodium salt _Chili saltpetre_ or _cubic nitre_, which occurs in\r\nnature, as already mentioned. The conversion of this salt into common\r\nnitre is also carried on by means of a double decomposition. This is done\r\neither by adding potassium carbonate (when, on mixing the strong and hot\r\nsolutions, sodium carbonate is directly obtained as a precipitate), or,\r\nas is now most frequent, potassium chloride. When a mixture of strong\r\nsolutions of potassium chloride and sodium nitrate is evaporated, sodium\r\nchloride first separates, because this salt, which is formed by the\r\ndouble decomposition KCl + NaNO_{3} = KNO_{3} + NaCl, is almost equally\r\nsoluble in hot and cold water; on cooling, therefore, a large amount of\r\npotassium nitrate separates from the saturated solution, while the sodium\r\nchloride remains dissolved. The nitre is ultimately purified by\r\nrecrystallisation and by washing with a saturated solution of nitre,\r\nwhich cannot dissolve a further quantity of nitre but only the\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\n  [14] Besides which Schloesing and Müntz, by employing similar methods\r\n       to Pasteur, showed that the formation of nitre in the\r\n       decomposition of nitrogenous substances is accomplished by the aid\r\n       of peculiar micro-organisms (ferments), without which the\r\n       simultaneous action of the other necessary conditions (alkalis,\r\n       moisture, a temperature of 37°, air, and nitrogenous substances)\r\n       cannot give nitre.\r\n\r\nNitre is a colourless salt having a peculiar cool taste. It crystallises\r\neasily in long striated six-sided rhombic prisms terminating in rhombic\r\npyramids. Its crystals (sp. gr. 1·93) do not contain water, but their\r\ncavities generally contain a certain quantity of the solution from\r\nwhich they have crystallised. For this reason in refining nitre,\r\nthe production of large crystals is prevented, _saltpetre flour_\r\nbeing prepared. At a low red heat (339°) nitre melts to a colourless\r\nliquid.[14 bis] Potassium nitrate at the ordinary temperature and in a\r\nsolid form is inactive and stable, but _at a high temperature_ it acts\r\nas a powerful _oxidising agent_, giving up a considerable amount of\r\noxygen to substances mixed with it.[15] When thrown on to incandescent\r\ncharcoal it brings about its rapid combustion, and a mechanical mixture\r\nof powdered charcoal and nitre ignites when brought into contact\r\nwith a red-hot substance, and continues to burn by itself. In this\r\naction, nitrogen is evolved, and the oxygen oxidises the charcoal, in\r\nconsequence of which potassium carbonate and carbonic anhydride are\r\nformed: 4KNO_{3} + 5C = 2K_{2}CO_{3} + 3CO_{2} + 2N_{2}. This phenomenon\r\ndepends on the fact that oxygen in combining with carbon evolves more\r\nheat than it does in combining with nitrogen. Hence, when once the\r\ncombustion has been started at the expense of the nitre, it is able to\r\ngo on without requiring the aid of external heat. A similar oxidation\r\nor combustion at the expense of the contained oxygen takes place when\r\nnitre is heated with different combustible substances. If a mixture of\r\nsulphur and nitre be thrown upon a red-hot surface, the sulphur burns,\r\nforming potassium sulphate and sulphurous anhydride. In this case, also,\r\nthe nitrogen of the nitre is evolved as gas: 2KNO_{3} + 2S = K_{2}SO_{4}\r\n+ N_{2} + SO_{2}. A similar phenomenon occurs when nitre is heated with\r\nmany metals. The oxidation of those metals which are able to form acid\r\noxides with an excess of oxygen is especially remarkable. In this case\r\nthey remain in combination with potassium oxide as potassium salts.\r\nManganese, antimony, arsenic, iron, chromium, &c. are instances of this\r\nkind. These elements, like carbon and sulphur, displace free nitrogen.\r\nThe lower oxides of these metals when fused with nitre pass into the\r\nhigher oxides. Organic substances are also oxidised when heated with\r\nnitre--that is, they burn at the expense of the nitre. It will be\r\nreadily understood from this that nitre is frequently used in practical\r\nchemistry and the arts as an oxidising agent at high temperatures.\r\nIts application in _gunpowder_ is based on this property; gunpowder\r\nconsists of a mechanical mixture of finely-ground sulphur, nitre, and\r\ncharcoal. The relative proportion of these substances varies according\r\nto the destination of the powder and to the kind of charcoal employed\r\n(a friable, incompletely-burnt charcoal, containing therefore hydrogen\r\nand oxygen, is employed). Gases are formed in its combustion, chiefly\r\nnitrogen and carbonic anhydride, which create a considerable pressure\r\nif their escape be in any way impeded. This action of gunpowder may be\r\nexpressed by the equation: 2KNO_{3} + 3C + S = K_{2}S + 3CO_{2} + N_{2}.\r\n\r\n  [14 bis] Before fusing, the crystals of potassium nitrate change their\r\n       form, and take the same form as sodium nitrate--that is, they\r\n       change into rhombohedra. Nitre crystallises from hot solutions,\r\n       and in general under the influence of a rise of temperature, in a\r\n       different form from that given at the ordinary or lower\r\n       temperatures. Fused nitre solidifies to a radiated crystalline\r\n       mass; but it does not exhibit this structure if metallic chlorides\r\n       be present, so that this method may be taken advantage of to\r\n       determine the degree of purity of nitre.\r\n\r\n       Carnelley and Thomson (1888) determined the fusing point of\r\n       mixtures of potassium and sodium nitrates. The first salt fuses at\r\n       339° and the second at 316°, and if _p_ be the percentage amount\r\n       of potassium nitrate, then the results obtained were--\r\n\r\n         _p_ = 10   20    30    40    50    60    70    80    90\r\n            298°   283°  268°  242°  231°  231°  242°  284°  306°\r\n\r\n       which confirms Shaffgotsch's observation (1857) that the lowest\r\n       fusing point (about 231°) is given by mixing molecular quantities\r\n       (_p_ = 54·3) of the salts--that is, in the formation of the alloy,\r\n       KNO_{3},NaNO_{3}.\r\n\r\n       A somewhat similar result was discovered by the same observers for\r\n       the solubility of mixtures of these salts at 20° in 100 parts of\r\n       water. Thus, if _p_ be the weight of potassium nitrate mixed with\r\n       100-_p_ parts by weight of sodium nitrate taken for solution, and\r\n       _c_ be the quantity of the mixed salts which dissolves in 100, the\r\n       solubility of sodium nitrate being 85, and of potassium nitrate\r\n       34, parts in 100 parts of water, then--\r\n\r\n              _p_ =  10   20   30   40   50  60  70  80  90\r\n              _c_ = 110  136  136  138  106  81  73  54  41\r\n\r\n       The maximum solubility proved not to correspond with the most\r\n       fusible mixture, but to one much richer in sodium nitrate.\r\n\r\n       Both these phenomena show that in homogeneous liquid mixtures the\r\n       chemical forces that act between substances are the same as those\r\n       that determine the molecular weights of substances, even when the\r\n       mixture consists of such analogous substances as potassium and\r\n       sodium nitrates, between which there is no direct chemical\r\n       interchange. It is instructive to note also that the maximum\r\n       solubility does not correspond with the minimum fusing point,\r\n       which naturally depends on the fact that in solution a third\r\n       substance, namely water, plays a part, although an attraction\r\n       between the salts, like that which exists between sodium and\r\n       potassium carbonates (Note 8), also partially acts.\r\n\r\n  [15] Fused nitre, with a further rise of temperature, disengages oxygen\r\n       and then nitrogen. The nitrite KNO_{2} is first formed and then\r\n       potassium oxide. The admixture of certain metals--for example, of\r\n       finely-divided copper--aids the last decomposition. The oxygen in\r\n       this case naturally passes over to the metal.\r\n\r\nIt is found by this equation that gunpowder should contain thirty-six\r\nparts of charcoal (13·3 p.c.), and thirty-two parts (11·9 p.c.) of\r\nsulphur, to 202 parts (74·8 p.c.) of nitre, which is very near to its\r\nactual composition.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] In China, where the manufacture of gunpowder has long been carried\r\n       on, 75·7 parts of nitre, 14·4 of charcoal, and 9·9 of sulphur are\r\n       used. Ordinary powder for sporting purposes contains 80 parts of\r\n       nitre, 12 of charcoal, and 8 of sulphur, whilst the gunpowder used\r\n       in heavy ordnance contains 75 of nitre, 15 of charcoal, and 10 of\r\n       sulphur. Gunpowder explodes when heated to 300°, when struck, or\r\n       by contact with a spark. A compact or finely-divided mass of\r\n       gunpowder burns slowly and has but little disruptive action,\r\n       because it burns gradually. To act properly the gunpowder must\r\n       have a definite rate of combustion, so that the pressure should\r\n       increase during the passage of the projectile along the barrel of\r\n       the fire-arm. This is done by making the powder in large granules\r\n       or in the shape of six-sided prisms with holes through them\r\n       (prismatic powder).\r\n\r\n       The products of combustion are of two kinds: (1) gases which\r\n       produce the pressure and are the cause of the dynamical action of\r\n       gunpowder, and (2) a solid residue, usually of a black colour\r\n       owing to its containing unburnt particles of charcoal. Besides\r\n       charcoal, the residue generally contains potassium sulphide,\r\n       K_{2}S, and a whole series of other salts--for instance, carbonate\r\n       and sulphate. It is apparent from this that the combustion of\r\n       gunpowder is not so simple as it appears to be from the above\r\n       formula, and hence the weight of the residue is also greater than\r\n       indicated by that formula. According to the formula, 270 parts of\r\n       gunpowder give 110 parts of residue--that is, 100 parts of powder\r\n       give 37·4 parts of residue, K_{2}S, whilst in reality the weight\r\n       of the residue varies from 40 p.c. to 70 p.c. (generally 52 p.c.).\r\n       This difference depends on the fact that so much oxygen (of the\r\n       nitre) remains in the residue, and it is evident that if the\r\n       residue varies the composition of the gases evolved by the powder\r\n       will vary also, and therefore the entire process will be different\r\n       in different cases. The difference in the composition of the gases\r\n       and residue depends, as the researches of Gay-Lussac, Shishkoff\r\n       and Bunsen, Nobel and Abel, Federoff, Debus, &c., show, on the\r\n       conditions under which the combustion of the powder proceeds. When\r\n       gunpowder burns in an open space, the gaseous products which are\r\n       formed do not remain in contact with the residue, and then a\r\n       considerable portion of the charcoal entering into the composition\r\n       of the powder remains unburnt, because the charcoal burns after\r\n       the sulphur at the expense of the oxygen of the nitre. In this\r\n       extreme case the commencement of the combustion of the gunpowder\r\n       may be expressed by the equation, 2KNO_{3} + 3C + S = 2C +\r\n       K_{2}SO_{4} + CO_{2} + N_{2}. The residue in a blank cartridge\r\n       often consists of a mixture of C, K_{2}SO_{4}, K_{2}CO_{3}, and\r\n       K_{2}S_{2}O_{3}. If the combustion of the gunpowder be impeded--if\r\n       it take place in a cartridge in the barrel of a gun--the quantity\r\n       of potassium sulphate will first be diminished, then the amount of\r\n       sulphite, whilst the amount of carbonic anhydride in the gases and\r\n       the amount of potassium sulphide in the residue will increase. The\r\n       quantity of charcoal entering into the action will then be also\r\n       increased, and hence the amount in the residue will decrease.\r\n       Under these circumstances the weight of the residue will be\r\n       less--for example, 4K_{2}CO_{3} + 4S = K_{2}SO_{4} + 3K_{2}S +\r\n       4CO_{2}. Besides which, carbonic oxide has been found in the\r\n       gases, and potassium bisulphide, K_{2}S_{2}, in the residue of\r\n       gunpowder. The amount of potassium sulphide, K_{2}S, increases\r\n       with the completeness of the combustion, and is formed in the\r\n       residue at the expense of the potassium sulphite. In recent times\r\n       the knowledge of the action of gunpowder and other explosives has\r\n       made much progress, and has developed into a vast province of\r\n       artillery science, which, guided by the discoveries of chemistry,\r\n\r\n       has worked out a 'smokeless powder' which burns without leaving a\r\n       residue, and does not therefore give any 'powder smoke' (to hinder\r\n       the rapidity of firing and aiming), and at the same time\r\n       disengages a greater volume of gas and consequently gives (under\r\n       proper conditions of combustion) the possibility of communicating\r\n       to the charge a greater initial velocity, and therefore greater\r\n       distance, force, and accuracy of aim. Such 'smokeless powder' is\r\n       prepared either from the varieties of nitrocellulose (Chapter VI.,\r\n       Note 37) or from a mixture of them with nitro-glycerine (_ibid_).\r\n       In burning they give, besides steam and nitrogen, generally a\r\n       large amount of oxide of carbon (this is a very serious drawback\r\n       in all the present forms of smokeless powder, because carbonic\r\n       oxide is poisonous), and also CO_{2}, H_{2}, &c.\r\n\r\n_Metallic potassium_ was obtained like sodium; first by the action of\r\na galvanic current, then by reduction of the hydroxide by means of\r\nmetallic iron, and lastly, by the action of charcoal on the carbonate\r\nat a high temperature. The behaviour of metallic potassium differs,\r\nhowever, from that of sodium, because it easily combines with carbonic\r\noxide, forming an explosive and inflammable mass.[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] The substances obtained in this case are mentioned in Chapter IX.,\r\n       Note 31.\r\n\r\nPotassium is quite as volatile as sodium, if not more so. At the\r\nordinary temperature potassium is even softer than sodium; its\r\nfreshly-cut surfaces present a whiter colour than sodium, but, like\r\nthe latter, and with even greater ease, it oxidises in moist air. It\r\nis brittle at low temperatures, but is quite soft at 25°, and melts at\r\n58°. At a low red heat (667°, Perkin) it distils without change, forming\r\na green vapour, whose density,[18] according to A. Scott (1887), is\r\nequal to 19 (if that of hydrogen = 1). This shows that the molecule\r\nof potassium (like that of sodium, mercury, and zinc) contains but one\r\natom. This is also the case with many other metals, judging by recent\r\nresearches.[19] The specific gravity of potassium at 15° is 0·87, and\r\nis therefore less than that of sodium, as is also the case with all\r\nits compounds.[20] Potassium decomposes water with great ease at the\r\nordinary temperature, evolving 45,000 heat units per atomic weight in\r\ngrams. The heat evolved is sufficient to inflame the hydrogen, the flame\r\nbeing coloured violet from the presence of particles of potassium.[21]\r\n\r\n  [18] A. Scott (1887) determined the vapour densities of many of the\r\n       alkali elements and their compounds in a platinum vessel heated in\r\n       a furnace and previously filled with nitrogen. But these, the\r\n       first data concerning a subject of great importance, have not yet\r\n       been sufficiently fully described, nor have they received as much\r\n       attention as could be desired. Taking the density of hydrogen as\r\n       unity, Scott found the vapour densities of the following\r\n       substances to be--\r\n\r\n              Na         12·75 (11·5).      KI      92 (84).\r\n              K          19    (19·5).      RbCl    70 (60).\r\n              CsCl       89·5  (84·2).      CsI    133 (130).\r\n              FeCl_{3}   68.                AgCl    80 (71·7).\r\n\r\n       In brackets are given the densities corresponding with the\r\n       formulæ, according to Avogadro-Gerhardt's law. This figure is not\r\n       given for FeCl_{3}, because in all probability under these\r\n       conditions (the temperature at which it was determined) a portion\r\n       of the FeCl_{3} was decomposed. If it was not decomposed, then a\r\n       density 81 would correspond with the formula FeCl_{3}, and if the\r\n       decomposition were Fe_{2}Cl_{6} = 2FeCl_{2} + Cl_{2}, then the\r\n       density should be 54. With regard to the silver chloride, there is\r\n       reason to think that the platinum decomposed this salt. The\r\n       majority of Scott's results so closely correspond with the formulæ\r\n       that a better concord cannot be expected in such determinations.\r\n       V. Meyer (1887) gives 93 as the density of KI.\r\n\r\n  [19] The molecules of non-metals are more complex--for instance, H_{2},\r\n       O_{3}, Cl_{2}, &c. But arsenic, whose superficial appearance\r\n       recalls that of metals, but whose chemical properties approach\r\n       more nearly to the non-metals, has a complex molecule containing\r\n       As_{4}.\r\n\r\n  [20] As the atomic weight of potassium is greater than that of sodium,\r\n       the volumes of the molecules, or the quotients of the molecular\r\n       weight by the specific gravity, for potassium compounds are\r\n       greater than those of sodium compounds, because both the\r\n       denominator and numerator of the fraction increase. We cite for\r\n       comparison the volumes of the corresponding compounds--\r\n\r\n       Na  24    NaHO  18    NaCl  28    NaNO_{3}  37    Na_{2}SO_{4}  54\r\n       K   45    KHO   27    KCl   39    KNO_{3}   48    K_{2}SO_{4}   66\r\n\r\n  [21] The same precautions must be taken in decomposing water by\r\n       potassium as have to be observed with sodium (Chapter II., Note\r\n       8).\r\n\r\n       It must be observed that potassium decomposes carbonic anhydride\r\n       and carbonic oxide when heated, the carbon being liberated and the\r\n       oxygen taken up by the metal, whilst on the other hand charcoal\r\n       takes up oxygen from potassium, as is seen from the preparation of\r\n       potassium by heating potash with charcoal, hence the reaction\r\n       K_{2}O + C = K_{2} + CO is reversible and the relation is the same\r\n       in this case as between hydrogen and zinc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relation of potassium to hydrogen and oxygen, it\r\nis closely analogous to sodium in this respect. Thus, with hydrogen\r\nit forms potassium hydride, K_{2}H (between 200° and 411°), and with\r\noxygen it gives a suboxide K_{4}O, oxide K_{2}O, and peroxide, only\r\nmore oxygen enters into the composition of the latter than in sodium\r\nperoxide; potassium peroxide contains KO_{2}, but it is probable that\r\nin the combustion of potassium an oxide KO is also formed. Potassium,\r\nlike sodium, is soluble in mercury.[22] In a word, the relation between\r\nsodium and potassium is as close as that between chlorine and bromine,\r\nor, better still, between fluorine and chlorine, as the atomic weight\r\nof sodium, 23, is as much greater than that of fluorine, 19, as that of\r\npotassium, 39, is greater than that of chlorine, 35·5.\r\n\r\n  [22] _Potassium_ forms _alloys with sodium_ in all proportions. The\r\n       alloys containing 1 and 3 equivalents of potassium to one\r\n       equivalent of sodium are _liquids_, like mercury at the ordinary\r\n       temperature. Joannis, by determining the amount of heat developed\r\n       by these alloys in decomposing water, found the evolution for\r\n       Na_{2}K, NaK, NaK_{2} and NaK_{3} to be 44·5, 44·1, 43·8 and 44·4\r\n       thousand heat units respectively (for Na 42·6 and for K 45·4). The\r\n       formation of the alloy NaK_{2} is therefore accompanied by the\r\n       development of heat, whilst the other alloys may be regarded as\r\n       solutions of potassium or sodium in this alloy. In any case a fall\r\n       of the temperature of fusion is evident in this instance as in the\r\n       alloys of nitre (Note 14). The liquid alloy NaK_{2} is now used\r\n       for filling thermometers employed for temperatures above 360°,\r\n       when mercury boils.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between _potassium_ and _sodium_ is so great that _their\r\ncompounds_ can only be easily _distinguished_ in the form of certain of\r\ntheir salts. For instance, the acid potassium tartrate, C_{4}H_{5}KO_{6}\r\n(cream of tartar), is distinguished by its sparing solubility in\r\nwater and in alcohol, and in a solution of tartaric acid, whilst the\r\ncorresponding sodium salt is easily soluble. Therefore, if a solution of\r\ntartaric acid be added in considerable excess to the solutions of the\r\nmajority of potassium salts, a precipitate of the sparingly-soluble acid\r\nsalt is formed, which does not occur with salts of sodium. The chlorides\r\nKCl and NaCl in solutions easily give double salts K_{2}PtCl_{6} and\r\nNa_{2}PtCl_{6}, with platinic chloride, PtCl_{4}, and the solubility\r\nof these salts is very different, especially in a mixture of alcohol\r\nand ether. The sodium salt is easily soluble, whilst the potassium salt\r\nis insoluble or almost so, and therefore the reaction with platinic\r\nchloride is that most often used for the separation of potassium from\r\nsodium, as is more fully described in works on analytical chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to discover the least traces of these metals in\r\nadmixture together, by means of their property of imparting different\r\ncolours to _a flame_. The presence of a salt of sodium in a flame is\r\nrecognised by a brilliant yellow coloration, and a pure potassium\r\nsalt colours a colourless flame violet. However, in the presence of\r\na sodium salt the pale violet coloration given by a potassium salt\r\nis quite undistinguishable, and it is at first sight impossible in\r\nthis case to discover the potassium salt in the presence of that of\r\nsodium. But by decomposing the light given by a flame coloured by these\r\nmetals or a mixture of them, by means of a prism, they are both easily\r\ndistinguishable, because the yellow light emitted by the sodium salt\r\ndepends on a group of light rays having a definite index of refraction\r\nwhich corresponds with the yellow portion of the solar spectrum, having\r\nthe index of refraction of the Fraunhofer line (strictly speaking,\r\ngroup of lines) D, whilst the salts of potassium give a light from\r\nwhich these rays are entirely absent, but which contain rays of a red\r\nand violet colour. Therefore, if a potassium salt occur in a flame, on\r\ndecomposing the light (after passing it through a narrow slit) by means\r\nof a prism, there will be seen red and violet bands of light situated\r\nat a considerable distance from each other; whilst if a sodium salt be\r\npresent a yellow line will also appear. If both metals simultaneously\r\noccur in a flame and emit light, the spectrum lines corresponding to the\r\npotassium and the sodium will appear simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Spectroscope. The prism and table are covered\r\nwith an opaque cover. The spectrum obtained from the flame coloured\r\nby a substance introduced on the wire is viewed through B. A light is\r\nplaced before the scale D in order to illuminate the image of the scale\r\nreflected through B by the side of the prism.]\r\n\r\nFor convenience in carrying on this kind of testing, _spectroscopes_\r\n(fig. 72) are constructed,[23] consisting of a refracting prism and\r\nthree tubes placed in the plane of the refracting angle of the prism.\r\nOne of the tubes, C, has a vertical slit at the end, giving access to\r\nthe light to be tested, which then passes into the tube (collimator),\r\ncontaining a lens which gives the rays a parallel direction. The rays\r\nof light having passed through the slit, and having become parallel,\r\nare refracted and dispersed in the prism, and the spectrum formed is\r\nobserved through the eye-piece of the other telescope B. The third\r\ntube D contains a horizontal transparent scale (at the outer end)\r\nwhich is divided into equal divisions. The light from a source such\r\nas a gas burner or candle placed before this tube, passes through the\r\nscale, and is reflected on that face of the prism which stands before\r\nthe telescope B, so that the image of the scale is seen through this\r\ntelescope simultaneously with the spectrum given by the rays passing\r\nthrough the slit of the tube C. In this manner the image of the scale\r\nand the spectrum given by the source of light under investigation are\r\nseen simultaneously. If the sun's rays be directed through the slit\r\nof the tube C, then the observer looking through the eye-piece of B\r\nwill see the solar spectrum, and (if the aperture of the slit be narrow\r\nand the apparatus correctly adjusted) the dark Fraunhofer lines in\r\nit.[24] Small-sized spectroscopes are usually so adjusted that (looking\r\nthrough B) the violet portion of the spectrum is seen to the right and\r\nthe red portion to the left, and the Fraunhofer line D (in the bright\r\nyellow portion of the spectrum) is situated on the 50th division of the\r\nscale.[25] If the light emitted by an incandescent solid--for example,\r\nthe Drummond light--be passed through the spectroscope, then all the\r\ncolours of the solar spectrum are seen, but not the Fraunhofer lines. To\r\nobserve the result given by a flame coloured by various salts a Bunsen\r\ngas burner (or the pale flame of hydrogen gas issuing from a platinum\r\norifice) giving so pale a flame that its spectrum will be practically\r\ninvisible is placed before the slit. If any compound of sodium be placed\r\nin the flame of the gas burner (for which purpose a platinum wire on\r\nwhose end sodium chloride is fused is fixed to the stand), then the\r\nflame is coloured yellow, and on looking through the spectroscope the\r\nobserver will see a bright _yellow_ line falling upon the 50th division\r\nof the scale, which is seen together with the spectrum in the telescope.\r\nNo yellow lines of other refractive index, nor any rays of any other\r\ncolour, will be seen, and, therefore, the spectrum corresponding with\r\nsodium compounds consists of yellow rays of that index of refraction\r\nwhich belong to the Fraunhofer (black) line D of the solar spectrum.\r\nIf a potassium salt be introduced into the flame instead of a sodium\r\nsalt, then two bands will be seen which are much feebler than the\r\nbright sodium band--namely, one red line near the Fraunhofer line A and\r\nanother violet line. Besides which, a pale, almost continuous, spectrum\r\nwill be observed in the central portions of the scale. If a mixture\r\nof sodium and potassium salts be now introduced into the flame, three\r\nlines will be seen simultaneously--namely, the red and pale violet\r\nlines of potassium and the yellow line of sodium. In this manner it is\r\npossible, by the aid of the spectroscope, to determine the relation\r\nbetween the spectra of metals and known portions of the solar spectrum.\r\nThe continuity of the latter is interrupted by dark lines (that is,\r\nby an absence of light of a definite index of refraction), termed the\r\nFraunhofer lines of the solar spectrum. It has been shown by careful\r\nobservations (by Fraunhofer, Brewster, Foucault, Ångstrom, Kirchhoff,\r\nCornu, Lockyer, Dewar, and others) that there exists an exact _agreement\r\nbetween the spectra_ of certain _metals_ and certain of the _Fraunhofer_\r\nlines. Thus the bright yellow sodium line exactly corresponds with the\r\ndark Fraunhofer line D of the solar spectrum. A similar agreement is\r\nobserved in the case of many other metals. This is not an approximate or\r\nchance correlation. In fact, if a spectroscope having a large number of\r\nrefracting prisms and a high magnifying power be used, it is seen that\r\nthe dark line D of the solar spectrum consists of an entire system of\r\nclosely adjacent but definitely situated fine and wide (sharp, distinct)\r\ndark lines,[26] and an exactly similar group of bright lines is obtained\r\nwhen the yellow sodium line is examined through the same apparatus, so\r\nthat each bright sodium line exactly corresponds with a dark line in the\r\nsolar spectrum.[26 bis] This conformity of the bright lines formed by\r\nsodium with the dark lines of the solar spectrum cannot be accidental.\r\nThis conclusion is further confirmed by the fact that the bright lines\r\nof other metals correspond with dark lines of the solar spectrum. Thus,\r\nfor example, a series of sparks passing between the iron electrodes\r\nof a Ruhmkorff coil gives 450 very distinct lines characterising this\r\nmetal. All these 450 bright lines, constituting the whole spectrum\r\ncorresponding with iron, are repeated, as Kirchhoff showed, in the\r\nsolar spectrum as dark Fraunhofer lines which occur in exactly the\r\nsame situations as the bright lines in the iron spectrum, just as the\r\nsodium lines correspond with the band D in the solar spectrum. Many\r\nobservers have in this manner studied the solar spectrum and the spectra\r\nof different metals simultaneously, and discovered in the former lines\r\nwhich correspond not only with sodium and iron, but also with many\r\nother metals.[27] The spectra of such elements as hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, and other gases may be observed in the so-called Geissler's\r\ntubes--that is, in glass tubes containing rarefied gases, through which\r\nthe discharge of a Ruhmkorff's coil is passed. Thus hydrogen gives a\r\nspectrum composed of three lines--a red line corresponding with the\r\nFraunhofer line C, a green line corresponding with the line F, and a\r\nviolet line corresponding with one of the lines between G and H. Of\r\nthese rays the red is the brightest, and therefore the general colour of\r\nluminous hydrogen (with an electric discharge through a Geissler tube)\r\nis reddish.\r\n\r\n  [23] For accurate measurements and comparative researches more\r\n       complicated spectroscopes are required which give a greater\r\n       dispersion, and are furnished for this purpose with several\r\n       prisms--for example, in Browning's spectroscope the light passes\r\n       through six prisms, and then, having undergone an internal total\r\n       reflection, passes through the upper portion of the same six\r\n       prisms, and again by an internal total reflection passes into the\r\n       ocular tube. With such a powerful dispersion the relative position\r\n       of the spectral lines may be determined with accuracy. For the\r\n       absolute and exact determination of the wave lengths it is\r\n       particularly important that the spectroscope should be furnished\r\n       with diffraction gratings. The construction of spectroscopes\r\n       destined for special purposes (for example, for investigating the\r\n       light of stars, or for determining the absorption spectra in\r\n       microscopic preparations, &c.) is exceedingly varied. Details of\r\n       the subject must be looked for in works on physics and on spectrum\r\n       analysis. Among the latter the best known for their completeness\r\n       and merit are those of Roscoe, Kayser, Vogel, and Lecoq de\r\n       Boisbaudran.\r\n\r\n  [24] The arrangement of all the parts of the apparatus so as to give\r\n       the clearest possible vision and accuracy of observation must\r\n       evidently precede every kind of spectroscopic determination.\r\n       Details concerning the practical use of the spectroscope must be\r\n       looked for in special works on the subject. In this treatise the\r\n       reader is supposed to have a certain knowledge of the physical\r\n       data respecting the refraction of light, and its dispersion and\r\n       diffraction, and the theory of light, which allows of the\r\n       determination of the length of the waves of light in absolute\r\n       measure on the basis of observations with diffraction gratings,\r\n       the distance between whose divisions may be easily measured in\r\n       fractions of a millimetre; by such means it is possible to\r\n       determine the wave-length of any given ray of light.\r\n\r\n  [25] In order to give an idea of the size of the scale, we may observe\r\n       that the ordinary spectrum extends from the zero of the scale\r\n       (where the red portion is situated) to the 170th division (where\r\n       the end of the visible violet portion of the spectrum is\r\n       situated), and that the Fraunhofer line A (the extreme prominent\r\n       line in the red) corresponds with the 17th division of the scale;\r\n       the Fraunhofer line F (at the beginning of the blue, near the\r\n       green colour) is situated on the 90th division, and the line G,\r\n       which is clearly seen in the beginning of the violet portion of\r\n       the spectrum, corresponds with the 127th division of the scale.\r\n\r\n  [26] The two most distinct lines of D, or of sodium, have wave-lengths\r\n       of 589·5 and 588·9 millionths of a millimeter, besides which\r\n       fainter and fainter lines are seen whose wave-lengths in\r\n       millionths of a millimeter are 588·7 and 588·1, 616·0 and 615·4,\r\n       515·5 and 515·2, 498·3 and 498·2, &c., according to Liveing and\r\n       Dewar.\r\n\r\n  [26 bis] In the ordinary spectroscopes which are usually employed in\r\n       chemical research, one yellow band, which does not split up into\r\n       thinner lines, is seen instead of the system of sodium lines,\r\n       owing to the small dispersive power of the prism and the width of\r\n       the slit of the object tube.\r\n\r\n  [27] The most accurate investigations made in this respect are carried\r\n       on with spectra obtained by diffraction, because in this case the\r\n       position of the dark and bright lines does not depend on the index\r\n       of refraction of the material of the prism, nor on the dispersive\r\n       power of the apparatus. The best--that is, the most general and\r\n       accurate--method of expressing the results of such determinations\r\n       consists in determining the lengths of the waves corresponding to\r\n       the rays of a definite index of refraction. (Sometimes instead of\r\n       this the fraction of 1 divided by the square of the wave-length is\r\n       given.) We will express this _wave-length_ in _millionth parts of\r\n       a millimetre_ (the ten-millionth parts are already doubtful, and\r\n       fall within the limits of error). In order to illustrate the\r\n       relation between the wave-lengths and the positions of the lines\r\n       of the spectrum, we will cite the wave-lengths corresponding with\r\n       the chief Fraunhofer lines and colours of the spectrum.\r\n\r\n       Fraunhofer line   A      B      C         D         E       b\r\n       Wave-length     761·0  687·5  656·6  589·5-588·9  527·3   518·7\r\n                       +-----------------+  +---------+  +----+  +---+\r\n       Colour                 red              orange    yellow  green\r\n\r\n       Fraunhofer line   F      G      H\r\n       Wave-length     486·5  431·0  397·2\r\n                       +----------+  +----+\r\n       Colour              blue      violet\r\n\r\n       In the following table are given the _wave-lengths_ of the light\r\n       rays (the longest and most distinct, _see_ later) for certain\r\n       elements, those in black type being the most clearly defined and\r\n       distinct lines, which are easily obtained either in the flame of a\r\n       Bunsen's burner, or in Geissler's tubes, or in general, by an\r\n       electric discharge. These lines refer to the elements (the lines\r\n       of compounds are different, as will be afterwards explained, but\r\n       many compounds are decomposed by the flame or by an electric\r\n       discharge), and moreover to the elements in an incandescent and\r\n       rarefied gaseous state, for the spectra sometimes vary\r\n       considerably with a variation of temperature and pressure.\r\n\r\n       It may be mentioned that the _red_ colour corresponds with lines\r\n       having a wave-length of from 780 (with a greater wave-length the\r\n       lines are hardly visible, and are ultra red) to 650, the _orange_\r\n       from 650 to 590, the _yellow_ from 590 to 520, the _green_ from\r\n       520 to 490, the _blue_ from 490 to 420, and the _violet_ from 420\r\n       to 380 millionth parts of a millimetre. Beyond 380 the lines are\r\n       scarcely visible, and belong to the ultra-violet. For fluorine\r\n       Moissan found as many as 13 bright lines from 744 to 623.\r\n\r\n       In the table (p. 565) which is arranged in conformity with the\r\n       image of the spectrum as it is seen (the red lines on the\r\n       left-hand and the violet on the right-hand side), the figures in\r\n       black type correspond with lines which are so bright and\r\n       distinctly visible that they may easily be made use of, both in\r\n       determining the relation between the divisions of the scale and\r\n       the wave-lengths, and in determining the admixture of a given\r\n       element with another. Brackets join those lines between which\r\n       several other lines are clearly visible if the dispersive power of\r\n       the spectroscope permits distinguishing the neighbouring lines. In\r\n       the ordinary laboratory spectroscopes with one prism, even with\r\n       all possible precision of arrangement and with a brilliancy of\r\n       light permitting the observations being made with a very narrow\r\n       aperture, the lines whose wave-lengths only differ by 2-3\r\n       millionths of a millimetre, are blurred together; and with a wide\r\n       aperture a series of lines differing by even as much as 20\r\n       millionths of a millimetre appear as one wide line. With a faint\r\n       light (that is, with a small quantity of light entering into the\r\n       spectroscope) only the most _brilliant_ lines are clearly visible.\r\n       The _length_ of the lines does not always correspond with their\r\n       brilliancy. According to Lockyer this length is determined by\r\n       placing the carbon electrodes (between which the incandescent\r\n       vapours of the metals are formed), not horizontally to the slit\r\n       (as they are generally placed, to give more light), but vertically\r\n       to it. Then certain lines appear long and others short. As a rule\r\n       (Lockyer, Dewar, Cornu), the longest lines are those with which it\r\n       is easiest to obtain _reversed_ spectra (_see_ later).\r\n       Consequently, these lines are the most characteristic. Only the\r\n       longest and most brilliant are given in our table, which is\r\n       composed on the basis of a collection of the data at our disposal\r\n       for _bright_ spectra of the _incandescent and rarefied vapours of\r\n       the elements_. As the spectra change with great variations of\r\n       temperature and vapour density (the faint lines become brilliant\r\n       whilst the bright lines sometimes disappear), which is\r\n       particularly clear from Ciamician's researches on the halogens,\r\n       until the method of observation and the theory of the subject are\r\n       enlarged, particular theoretical importance should not be given to\r\n       the wave-lengths showing the maximum brilliancy, which only\r\n       possess a practical significance in the common methods of\r\n       spectroscopic observations. In general the spectra of metals are\r\n       simpler than those of the halogens, and the latter are variable;\r\n       at an increased pressure all spectral lines become broader.\r\n\r\n       +-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+\r\n       | N_{2} | O_{2} | Cl_{2} | Br_{2} | I_{2} |  Pb   |  Sn  |  Tl  |\r\n       +-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+\r\n       |   --  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |   --  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  662  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  632} |   --  |   --   |  636   |   --  |  --   | 645  |  --  |\r\n       |  620} |  615  |   --   |   --   |  621  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  585} |   --  |   --   |   --   |  613  | 605·7 | 580} |  --  |\r\n       |  574} |   --  |  546}  |   --   |  579} | 560·7 | 556} |  --  |\r\n       |  544} |  543  |  539}  |  544}  |  560} | 554·7 |  --  | 549  |\r\n       |  535} |  533  |  528}  |  523}  |  545} | 537   |  --  | 535  |\r\n       |  527} |  516  |  519}  |  517   |  506} |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  516} |  495} |  494}  |  479   |   --  |  --   |  --  | 489  |\r\n       |   --  |  494} |  480}  |  470}  |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  457  |  470} |   --   |  462}  |   --  |  --   | 452  |  --  |\r\n       |  442  |  465} |   --   |  454   |  445  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  436} |  447} |  436}  |  437   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  426} |  432} |  431}  |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |   --  |   --  |   --   |   --   |  421  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |   --  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |  409  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  | 406   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       |   --  |   --  |   --   |   --   |   --  |  --   |  --  |  --  |\r\n       +-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+\r\n\r\n       +-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+------+------+-----+-------+-----+\r\n       |  In |  Ga |  Al |  Ba   |  Sr |  Ca  |  Mg  |  Zn |  Cd   |  Hg |\r\n       |-----+-----+-----+-------+-----|------+------|-----+-------+-----+\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- | 646  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- | 624 | 649·7 | 641 | 644  |  --  | 636 | 643·8 |  -- |\r\n       | 619 |  -- | 623 | 614   | 606 |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   | 615 |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- | 612  |  --  |  -- |  --   | 579 |\r\n       |  -- |  -- | 572 | 553·5 |  -- |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   | 577 |\r\n       |  -- |  -- | 570 | 549   | 548 | 559  |  --  |  -- | 537·7 | 546 |\r\n       | 525 |  -- |  -- |  --   | 524 |  --  | 518  |  -- | 533·6 |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- |  --  | 516  | 492 | 508·5 |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- | 493·3 |  -- |  --  |  --  | 481 |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- |  --  | 471  | 472 | 479·9 |  -- |\r\n       | 451 |  -- | 466 | 455   | 460 |  --  |  --  | 468 | 467·7 |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- | 445} | 448  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   |  -- | 442} |  --  |  -- |  --   | 436 |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- |  --   | 430 |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- | 417 |  -- |  --   | 421 | 423  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       |  -- |  -- |  -- | 413   |  -- |  --  |  --  |  -- |  --   |  -- |\r\n       | 410 | 403 | 396 |  --   | 408 | 397  | 384} |  -- |  --   | 404 |\r\n       |  -- |  -- | 394 |  --   |  -- | 393  | 383} |  -

In order to clearly understand the phenomenon of\r\nreversed spectra, it must be known that when light passes through\r\ncertain transparent substances these substances retain rays of a certain\r\nrefrangibility. The colour of solutions is a proof of this. Light\r\nwhich has passed through a yellow solution of a uranium salt contains\r\nno violet rays, and after having passed through a red solution of a\r\npermanganate, does not contain many rays in the yellow, blue, and green\r\nportions of the spectrum. Solutions of copper salts absorb nearly all\r\nred rays. Sometimes colourless solutions also absorb rays of certain\r\ndefinite refractive indexes, and give _absorption spectra_. Thus\r\nsolutions of salts of didymium absorb rays of a certain refrangibility,\r\nand therefore an impression of black lines is received,[28] as shown in\r\nfig. 73. Many vapours (iodine) and gases (nitric peroxide) give similar\r\nspectra. Light which has passed through a deep layer of aqueous vapour,\r\noxygen, or nitrogen also gives an absorption spectrum. For this reason\r\nthe peculiar (winter) dark lines discovered by Brewster are observed in\r\nsunlight, especially in the evening and morning, when the sun's rays\r\npass through the atmosphere (containing these substances) by a longer\r\npath than at mid-day. It is evident that the Fraunhofer lines may be\r\nascribed to the absorption of certain rays of light in its passage from\r\nthe luminous mass of the sun to the earth. The remarkable progress made\r\nin all spectroscopic research dates from the investigations made by\r\n_Kirchhoff_ (1859) on the relation between absorption spectra and the\r\nspectra of luminous incandescent gases. It had already been observed\r\nlong before (by Fraunhofer, Foucault, Ångstrom) that the bright spectrum\r\nof the sodium flame gives two bright lines which are in exactly the\r\nsame position as two black lines known as D in the solar spectrum,\r\nwhich evidently belong to an absorption spectrum. When Kirchhoff caused\r\ndiffused sunlight to fall upon the slit of a spectroscope, and placed\r\na sodium flame before it, a perfect superposition was observed--the\r\nbright sodium lines completely covered the black lines D of the solar\r\nspectrum. When further the continuous spectrum of a Drummond light\r\nshowed the black line D on placing a sodium flame between it and the\r\nslit of the spectroscope--that is, when the Fraunhofer line of the solar\r\nspectrum was artificially produced--then there was no doubt that its\r\nappearance in the solar spectrum was due to the light passing somewhere\r\nthrough incandescent vapours of sodium. Hence a new theory of _reversed\r\nspectra_[29] arose--that is, of the relation between the waves of\r\nlight emitted and absorbed by a substance under given conditions of\r\ntemperature; this is expressed by Kirchhoff's law, discovered by a\r\ncareful analysis of the phenomena. This law may be formulated in an\r\nelementary way as follows: At a given temperature the relation between\r\nthe intensity of the light emitted (of a definite wave-length) and\r\nthe absorptive capacity with respect to the same colour (of the same\r\nwave-length) is a constant quantity.[30] As a black dull surface emits\r\nand also absorbs a considerable quantity of heat rays whilst a polished\r\nmetallic surface both absorbs and emits but few, so a flame coloured\r\nby sodium emits a considerable quantity of yellow rays of a definite\r\nrefrangibility, and has the property of absorbing a considerable\r\nquantity of the rays of the same refractive index. In general, the\r\nmedium which emits definite rays also absorbs them.\r\n\r\n  [28] The method of observing absorption spectra consists in taking a\r\n       continuous spectrum of white light (one which does not show either\r\n       dark lines or particularly bright luminous bands--for instance,\r\n       the light of a candle, lamp, or other source). The collimator\r\n       (that is, the tube with the slit) is directed towards this light,\r\n       and then all the colours of the spectrum are visible in the ocular\r\n       tube. A transparent absorptive medium--for instance, a solution or\r\n       tube containing a gas--is then placed between the source of light\r\n       and the apparatus (or anywhere inside the apparatus itself in the\r\n       path of the rays). In this case either the entire spectrum is\r\n       uniformly fainter, or absorption bands appear on the bright field\r\n       of the continuous spectrum in definite positions along it. These\r\n       bands have different lengths and positions, and distinctness and\r\n       intensity of absorption, according to the properties of the\r\n       absorptive medium. Like the luminous spectra given by incandescent\r\n       gases and vapours, the absorption spectra of a number of\r\n       substances have already been studied, and some with great\r\n       precision--as, for example, the spectrum of the brown vapours of\r\n       nitrogen dioxide by Hasselberg (at Pulkowa), the spectra of\r\n       colouring matters (Eder and others), especially of those applied\r\n       to orthochromatic photography, the spectra of blood, chlorophyll\r\n       (the green constituent of leaves), and other similar substances,\r\n       all the more carefully as by the aid of their spectra the presence\r\n       of these substances may be discovered in small quantities (even in\r\n       microscopical quantities, by the aid of special appliances on the\r\n       microscope), and the changes they undergo investigated.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Absorption spectra of nitrogen dioxide\r\n       and iodine.]\r\n\r\n       The absorption spectra, obtained at the ordinary temperature and\r\n       proper to substances in all physical states, offer a most\r\n       extensive but as yet little studied field, both for the general\r\n       theory of spectroscopy, and for gaining an insight into the\r\n       structure of substances. The investigation of colouring matters\r\n       has already shown that in certain cases a definite change of\r\n       composition and structure entails not only a definite change of\r\n       the colours but also a displacement of the absorption bands by a\r\n       definite number of wave-lengths.\r\n\r\n  [29] A number of methods have been invented to demonstrate the\r\n       reversibility of spectra; among these methods we will cite two\r\n       which are very easily carried out. In Bunsen's method sodium\r\n       chloride is put into an apparatus for evolving hydrogen (the spray\r\n       of the salt is then carried off by the hydrogen and colours the\r\n       flame with the yellow sodium colour), and the hydrogen is ignited\r\n       in two burners--in one large one with a wide flame giving a bright\r\n       yellow sodium light, and in another with a small fine orifice\r\n       whose flame is pale: this flame will throw a dark patch on the\r\n       large bright flame. In Ladoffsky's method the front tube (p. 561)\r\n       is unscrewed from a spectroscope directed towards the light of a\r\n       lamp (a continuous spectrum), and the flame of a spirit lamp\r\n       coloured by a small quantity of NaCl is placed between the tube\r\n       and the prism; a black band corresponding to sodium will then be\r\n       seen on looking through the ocular tube. This experiment is always\r\n       successful if only there be the requisite relation between the\r\n       strength of light of the two lamps.\r\n\r\n  [30] The absorptive capacity is the relation between the intensity\r\n       of the light (of a given wave-length) falling upon and retained by\r\n       a substance. Bunsen and Roscoe showed by direct experiment that\r\n       this ratio is a constant quantity for every substance. If _A_\r\n       stand for this ratio for a given substance at a given\r\n       temperature--for instance, for a flame coloured by sodium--and _E_\r\n       be the intensity of the light of the same wave-length emitted at\r\n       the same temperature by the same substance, then Kirchhoff's law,\r\n       the explanation and deduction of which must be looked for in\r\n       text-books of physics, states that the fraction _A/E_ is a\r\n       constant quantity depending on the nature of a substance (as _A_\r\n       depends on it) and determined by the temperature and wave-length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Bright spectra of copper compounds.]\r\n\r\nThus the bright spectral rays characteristic of a given metal may\r\nbe reversed--that is, converted into dark lines--by passing light\r\nwhich gives a continuous spectrum through a space containing the\r\nheated vapours of the given metal. A similar phenomenon to that thus\r\nartificially produced is observed in sunlight, which shows dark lines\r\ncharacteristic of known metals--that is, the Fraunhofer lines form\r\nan absorption spectrum or depend on a reversed spectrum; it being\r\npresupposed that the sun itself, like all known sources of artificial\r\nlight, gives a continuous spectrum without Fraunhofer lines.[31] We\r\nmust imagine that the sun, owing to the high temperature which is\r\nproper to it, emits a brilliant light which gives a continuous spectrum,\r\nand that this light, before reaching our eyes, passes through a space\r\nfull of the vapours of different metals and their compounds. As the\r\nearth's atmosphere[32] contains very little, or no, metallic vapours,\r\nand as they cannot be supposed to exist in the celestial space,[32 bis]\r\nthe only place in which the existence of such vapours can be admitted\r\nis in the _atmosphere surrounding the sun itself_. As the cause of\r\nthe sun's luminosity must be looked for in its high temperature, the\r\nexistence of an atmosphere containing metallic vapours is readily\r\nunderstood, because at that high temperature such metals as sodium,\r\nand even iron, are separated from their compounds and converted into\r\nvapour. The sun must be imagined as surrounded by an atmosphere of\r\nincandescent vaporous and gaseous matter,[33] including those elements\r\nwhose reversed spectra correspond with the Fraunhofer lines--namely,\r\nsodium, iron, hydrogen, lithium, calcium, magnesium, &c. Thus in\r\nspectrum analysis we find a means of determining the composition of\r\nthe inaccessible heavenly luminaries, and much has been done in this\r\nrespect since Kirchhoff's theory was formulated. By observations on the\r\nspectra of many heavenly bodies, changes have been discovered going on\r\nin them,[34] and many of the elements known to us have been found with\r\ncertainty in them.[35] From this it must be concluded that the same\r\nelements which exist on the earth occur throughout the whole universe,\r\nand that at that degree of heat which is proper to the sun those simple\r\nsubstances which we accept as the elements in chemistry are still\r\nundecomposed and remain unchanged. A high temperature forms one of those\r\nconditions under which compounds most easily decompose; and if sodium\r\nor a similar element were a compound, in all probability it would be\r\ndecomposed into component parts at the high temperature of the sun. This\r\nmay indeed be concluded from the fact that in ordinary spectroscopic\r\nexperiments the spectra obtained often belong to the metals and not\r\nto the compounds taken; this depends on the decomposition of these\r\ncompounds in the heat of the flame. If common salt be introduced\r\ninto the flame of a gas-burner, a portion of it is decomposed, first\r\nforming, in all probability, with water, hydrochloric acid and sodium\r\nhydroxide, and the latter then becoming partially decomposed by the\r\nhydrocarbons, giving metallic sodium, whose incandescent vapour emits\r\nlight of a definite refrangibility. This conclusion is arrived at from\r\nthe following experiment:--If hydrochloric acid gas be introduced into\r\na flame coloured by sodium it is observed that the sodium spectrum\r\ndisappears, owing to the fact that metallic sodium cannot remain in the\r\nflame in the presence of an excess of hydrochloric acid. The same thing\r\ntakes place on the addition of sal-ammoniac, which in the heat of the\r\nflame gives hydrochloric acid. If a porcelain tube containing sodium\r\nchloride (or sodium hydroxide or carbonate), and closed at both ends\r\nby glass plates, be so powerfully heated that the salt volatilises,\r\nthen the sodium spectrum is not observable; but if the salt be replaced\r\nby sodium, then either the bright line or the absorption spectra is\r\nobtained, according to whether the light emitted by the incandescent\r\nvapour be observed, or light passing through the tube. Thus the above\r\nspectrum is not given by sodium chloride or other sodium compound, but\r\nis proper to the metal sodium itself. This is also the case with other\r\nanalogous metals. The chlorides and other halogen _compounds_ of barium,\r\ncalcium, copper, &c., give independent spectra which differ from those\r\nof the metals. If barium chloride be introduced into a flame, it gives\r\na mixed spectrum belonging to metallic barium and barium chloride. If\r\nbesides barium chloride, hydrochloric acid or sal-ammoniac be introduced\r\ninto the flame, then the spectrum of the metal disappears, and that of\r\nthe chloride remains, which differs distinctly from the spectrum of\r\nbarium fluoride, barium bromide, or barium iodide. A certain common\r\nresemblance and certain common lines are observed in the spectra of\r\ntwo different compounds of one and the same element obtained in the\r\nabove-described manner, and also in the spectrum of the metal, but they\r\nall have their peculiarities. The independent spectra of the compounds\r\nof copper are easily observed (fig. 75). Thus certain compounds which\r\nexist in a state of vapour, and are luminous at a high temperature,\r\ngive their independent spectra. In the majority of cases the spectra of\r\ncompounds are composed of indistinct luminous lines and complete bright\r\nbands, whilst metallic elements generally give a few clearly-defined\r\nspectral lines.[36] There is no reason for supposing that the spectrum\r\nof a compound is equal to the sum of the spectra of its elements--that\r\nis, _every compound_ which is not decomposed by heat _has its own\r\nproper spectrum_. This is best proved by absorption spectra, which are\r\nessentially only reversed spectra observed at low temperatures. If every\r\nsalt of sodium, lithium, and potassium gives one and the same spectrum,\r\nthis must be ascribed to the presence in the flame of the free metals\r\nliberated by the decomposition of their salts. Therefore _the phenomena\r\nof the spectrum are determined by molecules, and not by atoms_--that\r\nis, the molecules of the metal sodium, and not its atoms, produce those\r\nparticular vibrations which determine the spectrum of a sodium salt.\r\nWhere there is no free metallic sodium there is no sodium spectrum.\r\n\r\n  [31] Heated metals begin to emit light (only visible in the dark) at\r\n       about 420° (varying with the metal). On further heating, solids\r\n       first emit red, then yellow, and lastly white light. Compressed or\r\n       heavy gases (_see_ Chapter III., Note 44), when strongly heated,\r\n       also emit white light. Heated liquids (for example, molten steel\r\n       or platinum) also give a white compound light. This is readily\r\n       understood. In a dense mass of matter the collisions of the\r\n       molecules and atoms are so frequent that waves of only a few\r\n       definite lengths cannot appear; the reverse is possible in\r\n       rarefied gases or vapours.\r\n\r\n  [32] Brewster, as is mentioned above, first distinguished the\r\n       atmospheric, cosmical Fraunhofer lines from the solar lines.\r\n       Janssen showed that the spectrum of the atmosphere contains lines\r\n       which depend on the absorption produced by aqueous vapour.\r\n       Egoreff, Olszewski, Janssen, and Liveing and Dewar showed by a\r\n       series of experiments that the oxygen of the atmosphere gives rise\r\n       to certain lines of the solar spectrum, especially the line A.\r\n       Liveing and Dewar took a layer of 165 c.m. of oxygen compressed\r\n       under a pressure of 85 atmospheres, and determined its absorption\r\n       spectrum, and found that, besides the Fraunhofer lines A and B, it\r\n       contained the following groups: 630-622, 581-568, 535, 480-475.\r\n       The same lines were found for liquid oxygen.\r\n\r\n  [32 bis] If the material of the whole heavenly space formed the\r\n       absorbent medium, the spectra of the stars would be the same as\r\n       the solar spectrum; but Huyghens, Lockyer, and others showed not\r\n       only that this is the case for only a few stars, but that the\r\n       majority of stars give spectra of a different character with dark\r\n       and bright lines and bands.\r\n\r\n  [33] Eruptions, like our volcanic eruptions, but on an incomparably\r\n       larger scale, are of frequent occurrence on the sun. They are seen\r\n       as protuberances visible during a total eclipse of the sun, in the\r\n       form of vaporous masses on the edge of the solar disc and emitting\r\n       a faint light. These protuberances of the sun are now observed at\r\n       all times by means of the spectroscope (Lockyer's method), because\r\n       they contain luminous vapours (giving bright lines) of hydrogen\r\n       and other elements.\r\n\r\n  [34] The great interest and vastness of astro-physical observations\r\n       concerning the sun, comets, stars, nebulæ, &c., render this new\r\n       province of natural science very important, and necessitate\r\n       referring the reader to special works on the subject.\r\n\r\n       The most important astro-physical data since the time of Kellner\r\n       are those referring to the _displacement_ of the lines of the\r\n       spectrum. Just as a musical note changes its pitch with the\r\n       approach or withdrawal of the resonant object or the ear, so the\r\n       pitch of the luminous note or wave-length of the light varies if\r\n       the luminous (or absorbent) vapour and the earth from which we\r\n       observe it approach or recede from each other; this expresses\r\n       itself in a visible displacement of the spectral lines. The solar\r\n       eruptions even give broken lines in the spectrum, because the\r\n       rapidly moving eruptive masses of vapour and gases either travel\r\n       in the direction of the eye or fall back towards the sun. As the\r\n       earth travels with the solar system among the stars, so it is\r\n       possible to determine the direction and velocity with which the\r\n       sun travels in space by the displacement of the spectral lines and\r\n       light of the stars. The changes proceeding on the sun in its mass,\r\n       which must be pronounced as vaporous, and in its atmosphere, are\r\n       now studied by means of the spectroscope. For this purpose, many\r\n       special astro-physical observatories now exist where these\r\n       investigations are carried on.\r\n\r\n       We may remark that if the observer or luminous object moves with a\r\n       velocity ±_v_, the ray, whose wave-length is [Greek: l], has an\r\n       apparent wave-length [Greek: l](_n_±_v_)/_n_, where _n_ is the\r\n       velocity of light. Thus Tolon, Huyghens, and others proved that\r\n       the star Aldebaran approaches the solar system with a velocity of\r\n       30 kilometres per second, while Arcturus is receding with a\r\n       velocity of 45 kilometres. The majority of stars give a distinct\r\n       hydrogen spectrum, besides which nebulæ also give the spectrum of\r\n       nitrogen. Lockyer classes the stars from their spectra, according\r\n       to their period of formation, showing that some stars are in a\r\n       period of increasing temperature (of formation or aggregation),\r\n       whilst others are in a period of cooling. Altogether, in the\r\n       astro-physical investigation of the spectra of heavenly bodies we\r\n       find one of the most interesting subjects of recent science.\r\n\r\n  [35] Spectrum analysis has proved the indubitable existence in the sun\r\n       and stars of a number of elements known in chemistry. Huyghens,\r\n       Secchi, Lockyer, and others have furnished a large amount of\r\n       material upon this subject. A compilation of existing information\r\n       on it has been given by Prof. S. A. Kleiber, in the Journal of the\r\n       Russian Physico-chemical Society for 1885 (vol. xviii. p. 146).\r\n       Besides which, a peculiar element called helium has been\r\n       discovered, which is characterised by a line (whose wave-length is\r\n       587·5, situated near D), which is seen very brightly in the\r\n       projections (protuberances) and spots of the sun, but which does\r\n       not belong to any known element, and is not reproducible as a\r\n       reversed, dark line. This may be a right conclusion--that is to\r\n       say, it is possible that an element may be discovered to which the\r\n       spectrum of helium corresponds--but it may be that the helium line\r\n       belongs to one of the known elements, because spectra vary in the\r\n       brilliancy and position of their lines with changes of temperature\r\n       and pressure. Thus, for instance, Lockyer could only see the line\r\n       423, at the very end of the calcium spectrum, at comparatively low\r\n       temperatures, whilst the lines 397 and 393 appear at a higher\r\n       temperature, and at a still higher temperature the line 423\r\n       becomes quite invisible.\r\n\r\n  [36] Spectroscopic observations are still further complicated by the\r\n       fact that one and the same substance gives different spectra at\r\n       different temperatures. This is especially the case with gases\r\n       whose spectra are obtained by an electric discharge in tubes.\r\n       Plücker, Wüllner, Schuster, and others showed that at low\r\n       temperatures and pressures the spectra of iodine, sulphur,\r\n       nitrogen, oxygen, &c. are quite different from the spectra of the\r\n       same elements at high temperatures and pressures. This may either\r\n       depend on the fact that the elements change their molecular\r\n       structure with a change of temperature, just as ozone is converted\r\n       into oxygen (for instance, from N_{2} molecules are obtained\r\n       containing only one atom of nitrogen), or else it may be because\r\n       at low temperature certain rays have a greater relative intensity\r\n       than those which appear at higher temperatures. If we suppose that\r\n       the molecules of a gas are in continual motion, with a velocity\r\n       dependent on the temperature, then it must be admitted that they\r\n       often strike against each other and rebound, and thus communicate\r\n       peculiar motions to each other and the supposed ether, which\r\n       express themselves in luminiferous phenomena. A rise of the\r\n       temperature or an increase in the density of a gas must have an\r\n       influence on the collision of its molecules and luminiferous\r\n       motions thus produced, and this may be the cause of the difference\r\n       of the spectra under these circumstances. It has been shown by\r\n       direct experiment that gases compressed by pressure, when the\r\n       collision of the molecules must be frequent and varied, exhibit a\r\n       more complex spectrum on the passage of an electric spark than\r\n       rarefied gases, and that even a continuous spectrum appears. In\r\n       order to show the variability of the spectrum according to the\r\n       circumstances under which it proceeds, it may be mentioned that\r\n       potassium sulphate fused on a platinum wire gives, on the passage\r\n       of a series of sparks, a distinct system of lines, 583-578, whilst\r\n       when a series of sparks is passed through a solution of this salt\r\n       this system of lines is faint, and when Roscoe and Schuster\r\n       observed the absorption spectrum of the vapour of metallic\r\n       potassium (which is green) they remarked a number of lines of the\r\n       same intensity as the above system in the red, orange, and yellow\r\n       portions.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Method of showing the spectrum of\r\n       substances in solution.]\r\n\r\n       The spectra of solutions are best observed by means of Lecoq de\r\n       Boisbaudran's arrangement, shown in fig. 76. A bent capillary\r\n       tube, D F, inside which a platinum wire, A _a_ (from 0·3 to 0·5\r\n       mm. in diameter) is fused, is immersed in a narrow cylinder, C (in\r\n       which it is firmly held by a cork). The projecting end, _a_, of\r\n       the wire is covered by a fine capillary tube, _d_, which extends\r\n       1-2 mm. beyond the wire. Another straight capillary tube, E, with\r\n       a platinum wire, B _b_, about 1 mm. in diameter (a finer wire soon\r\n       becomes hot), is held (by a cork or in a stand) above the end of\r\n       the tube, D. If the wire A be now connected with the positive, and\r\n       the wire B with the negative terminal of a Ruhmkorff's coil (if\r\n       the wires be connected in the opposite order, the spectrum of air\r\n       is obtained), a series of sparks rapidly following each other\r\n       appear between _a_ and _b_, and their light may be examined by\r\n       placing the apparatus in front of the slit of a spectroscope. The\r\n       variations to which a spectrum is liable may easily be observed by\r\n       increasing the distance between the wires, altering the direction\r\n       of the current or strength of the solution, &c.\r\n\r\n_Spectrum analysis_ has not only endowed science with a knowledge of\r\nthe composition of distant heavenly bodies (of the sun, stars, nebulæ,\r\ncomets, &c.), but has also given a new _method_ for studying the matter\r\nof the earth's surface. With its help Bunsen discovered two new elements\r\nbelonging to the group of the alkali metals, and thallium, indium, and\r\ngallium were afterwards discovered by the same means. The spectroscope\r\nis employed in the study of rare metals (which in solution often give\r\ndistinct absorption spectra), of dyes, and of many organic substances,\r\n&c.[37] With respect to the metals which are analogous to sodium, they\r\nall give similar very volatile salts and such very characteristic\r\nspectra that the least traces of them[38] are discovered with great\r\nease by means of the spectroscope. For instance, _lithium_ gives a very\r\nbrilliant red coloration to a flame and a very bright red spectral line\r\n(wave-length, 670 millionths mm.), which indicates the presence of this\r\nmetal in admixture with compounds of other alkali metals.\r\n\r\n  [37] The importance of the spectroscope for the purpose of chemical\r\n       research was already shown by Gladstone in 1856, but it did not\r\n       become an accessory to the laboratory until after the discoveries\r\n       of Kirchhoff and Bunsen. It may be hoped that in time\r\n       spectroscopic researches will meet certain wants of the\r\n       theoretical (philosophical) side of chemistry, but as yet all that\r\n       has been done in this respect can only be regarded as attempts\r\n       which have not yet led to any trustworthy conclusions. Thus many\r\n       investigators, by collating the wave-lengths of all the light\r\n       vibrations excited by a given element, endeavour to find the law\r\n       governing their mutual relations; others (especially Hartley and\r\n       Ciamician), by comparing the spectra of analogous elements (for\r\n       instance, chlorine, bromine, and iodine), have succeeded in\r\n       noticing definite features of resemblance in them, whilst others\r\n       (Grünwald) search for relations between the spectra of compounds\r\n       and their component elements, &c.; but--owing to the multiplicity\r\n       of the spectral lines proper to many elements, and (especially in\r\n       the ultra-red and ultra-violet ends of the spectrum) the existence\r\n       of lines which are undistinguishable owing to their faintness, and\r\n       also owing to the comparative novelty of spectroscopic\r\n       research--this subject cannot be considered as in any way\r\n       perfected. Nevertheless, in certain instances there is evidently\r\n       some relationship between the wave-lengths of all the spectral\r\n       lines formed by a given element. Thus, in the hydrogen spectrum\r\n       the wave-length = 364·542 _m_^2/(_m_^{2}-4), if _m_ varies as a\r\n       series of whole numbers from 3 to 15 (Walmer, Hagebach, and\r\n       others). For example, when _m_ = 3, the wave-length of one of the\r\n       brightest lines of the hydrogen spectrum is obtained (656·2), when\r\n       _m_ = 7, one of the visible violet lines (396·8), and when _m_ is\r\n       greater than 9, the ultra-violet lines of the hydrogen spectrum.\r\n\r\n  [38] In order to show the degree of sensitiveness of spectroscopic\r\n       reactions the following observation of Dr. Bence Jones may be\r\n       cited: If a solution of 3 grains of a lithium salt be injected\r\n       under the skin of a guinea-pig, after the lapse of four minutes,\r\n       lithium can be discovered in the bile and liquids of the eye, and,\r\n       after ten minutes, in all parts of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Preparation of lithium by the action of a\r\ngalvanic current on fused lithium chloride.]\r\n\r\n_Lithium_, Li, is, like potassium and sodium, somewhat widely spread\r\nin siliceous rocks, but only occurs in small quantities and as mere\r\ntraces in considerable masses of potassium and sodium salts. Only a\r\nvery few rather rare minerals contain more than traces of it,[39] for\r\nexample, spodumene and lithia mica. Many compounds of lithium are in all\r\nrespects closely analogous to the corresponding compounds of sodium\r\nand potassium; but the _carbonate_ is sparingly soluble in cold water,\r\nwhich fact is taken advantage of for separating lithium from potassium\r\nand sodium. This salt, Li_{2}CO_{3}, is easily converted into the other\r\ncompounds of lithium. Thus, for instance, the lithium hydroxide, LiHO,\r\nis obtained in exactly the same way as caustic soda, by the action of\r\nlime on the carbonate, and it is soluble in water and crystallises\r\n(from its solution in alcohol) as LiHO,H_{2}O. Metallic _lithium_ is\r\nobtained by the action of a galvanic current on fused lithium chloride;\r\nfor this purpose a cast-iron crucible, furnished with a stout cover,\r\nis filled with lithium chloride, heated until the latter fuses, and a\r\nstrong galvanic current is then passed through the molten mass. The\r\npositive pole (fig. 77) consists of a dense carbon rod C (surrounded\r\nby a porcelain tube P fixed in an iron tube BB), and the negative pole\r\nof an iron wire, on which the metal is deposited after the current has\r\npassed through the molten mass for a certain length of time. Chlorine\r\nis evolved at the positive pole. When a somewhat considerable quantity\r\nof the metal has accumulated on the wire it is withdrawn, the metal is\r\ncollected from it, and the experiment is then carried on as\r\nbefore.[39 bis] Lithium is the lightest of all metals, its specific\r\ngravity is 0·59, owing to which it floats even on naphtha; it melts at\r\n180°, but does not volatilise at a red heat. Its appearance recalls that\r\nof sodium, and, like it, it has a yellow tint. At 200° it burns in air\r\nwith a very bright flame, forming lithium oxide. In decomposing water it\r\ndoes not ignite the hydrogen. The characteristic test for lithium\r\ncompounds is the _red coloration_ which they impart to a colourless\r\nflame.[40]\r\n\r\n  [39] Thus _spodumene_ contains up to 6 p.c. of lithium oxide, and\r\n       _petolite_, and _lepidolite_ or lithia mica, about 3 p.c. of\r\n       lithium oxide. This mica is met with in certain granites in a\r\n       somewhat considerable quantity, and is therefore most frequently\r\n       employed for the preparation of lithium compounds. The treatment\r\n       of lepidolite is carried on on a large scale, because certain\r\n       salts of lithium are employed in medicine as a remedy for certain\r\n       diseases (stone, gouty affections), as they have the power of\r\n       dissolving the insoluble uric acid which is then deposited.\r\n       Lepidolite, which is unacted on by acids in its natural state,\r\n       decomposes under the action of strong hydrochloric acid after it\r\n       has been fused. After being subjected to the action of the\r\n       hydrochloric acid for several hours all the silica is obtained in\r\n       an insoluble form, whilst the metallic oxides pass into solution\r\n       as chlorides. This solution is mixed with nitric acid to convert\r\n       the ferrous salts into ferric, and sodium carbonate is then added\r\n       until the liquid becomes neutral, by which means a precipitate is\r\n       formed of the oxides of iron, alumina, magnesia, &c., as insoluble\r\n       oxides and carbonates. The solution (with an excess of water) then\r\n       contains the chlorides of the alkaline metals KCl, NaCl, LiCl,\r\n       which do not give a precipitate with sodium carbonate in a dilute\r\n       solution. It is then evaporated, and a strong solution of sodium\r\n       carbonate added. This precipitates lithium carbonate, which,\r\n       although soluble in water, is much less so than sodium carbonate,\r\n       and therefore the latter precipitates lithium from strong\r\n       solutions as carbonate, 2LiCl + Na_{2}CO_{3} = 2NaCl +\r\n       Li_{2}CO_{3}. _Lithium carbonate_, which resembles sodium\r\n       carbonate in many respects, is a substance which is very slightly\r\n       soluble in cold water and is only moderately soluble in boiling\r\n       water. In this respect lithium forms a transition between the\r\n       metals of the alkalis and other metals, especially those of the\r\n       alkaline earths (magnesium, barium), whose carbonates are only\r\n       sparingly soluble. Oxide of lithium, Li_{2}O, may be obtained by\r\n       heating lithium carbonate with charcoal. Lithium oxide in\r\n       dissolving gives (per gram-molecule) 26,000 heat units; but the\r\n       combination of Li_{2} with O evolves 140,000 calories--that is,\r\n       more than Na_{2}O (100,000 calories) and K_{2}O (97,000 calories),\r\n       as shown by Beketoff (1887). Oeuvrard (1892) heated lithium to\r\n       redness in nitrogen, and observed the absorption of N and\r\n       formation of Li_{3}N, like Na_{3}N (_see_ Chapter XII. Note 50).\r\n\r\n       LiCl, LiBr, and LiI form crystallo-hydrates with H_{2}O, 2H_{2}O,\r\n       and 3H_{2}O. As a rule, LiBr,2H_{2}O crystallises out, but\r\n       Bogorodsky (1894) showed that a solution containing LiBr +\r\n       3·7H_{2}O, cooled to -62°, separates out crystals LiBr,3H_{2}O,\r\n       which decompose at +4° with the separation of H_{2}O. LiF is but\r\n       slightly soluble (in 800 parts) in water (and still less so in a\r\n       solution of NH_{4}F).\r\n\r\n  [39 bis] Guntz (1893) recommends adding KCl to the LiCl in preparing Li\r\n       by this method, and to act with a current of 10 ampères at 20\r\n       volts, and not to heat above 450°, so as to avoid the formation of\r\n       Li_{2}Cl.\r\n\r\n  [40] In determining the presence of lithium in a given compound, it is\r\n       best to treat the material under investigation with acid (in the\r\n       case of mineral silicon compounds hydrofluoric acid must be\r\n       taken), and to treat the residue with sulphuric acid, evaporate to\r\n       dryness, and extract with alcohol, which dissolves a certain\r\n       amount of the lithium sulphate. It is easy to discover lithium in\r\n       such an alcoholic solution by means of the coloration imparted to\r\n       the flame on burning it, and in case of doubt by investigating its\r\n       light in a spectroscope, because lithium gives a red line, which\r\n       is very characteristic and is found as a dark line in the solar\r\n       spectrum. Lithium was first discovered in 1817 in petolite by\r\n       Arfvedson.\r\n\r\nBunsen in 1860 tried to determine by means of the spectroscope whether\r\nany other as yet unknown metals might not occur in different natural\r\nproducts together with lithium, potassium, and sodium, and he soon\r\ndiscovered two new alkali metals showing independent spectra. They are\r\nnamed after the characteristic coloration which they impart to the\r\nflame. One which gives a red and violet band is named _rubidium_, from\r\n_rubidius_ (dark red), and the other is called _cæsium_, because it\r\ncolours a pale flame sky blue, which depends on its containing bright\r\nblue rays, which appear in the spectrum of cæsium as two blue bands\r\n(table on p. 565). Both metals accompany sodium, potassium, and lithium,\r\nbut in small quantities; rubidium occurs in larger quantity than cæsium.\r\nThe amount of the oxides of cæsium and rubidium in lepidolite does not\r\ngenerally exceed one-half per cent. Rubidium has also been found in the\r\nashes of many plants, while the Stassfurt carnallite (the mother-liquor\r\nobtained after having been treated for KCl) forms an abundant source\r\nfor rubidium and also partly for cæsium. Rubidium also occurs, although\r\nin very small quantities, in the majority of mineral waters. In a very\r\nfew cases cæsium is not accompanied by rubidium; thus, in a certain\r\ngranite on the Isle of Elba, cæsium has been discovered, but not\r\nrubidium. This granite contains a very rare mineral called _pollux_,\r\nwhich contains as much as 34 per cent. of cæsium oxide. Guided by the\r\nspectroscope, and aided by the fact that the double salts of platinic\r\nchloride and rubidium and cæsium chlorides are still less soluble in\r\nwater than the corresponding potassium salt, K_{2}PtCl_{6},[41] Bunsen\r\nsucceeded in separating both metals from each other and from potassium,\r\nand demonstrated the great resemblance they bear to each other. The\r\nisolated metals,[42] rubidium and cæsium, have respectively the specific\r\ngravities 1·52 and 2·366, and melting points 39° and 27° as N. N.\r\nBeketoff showed (1894), he having obtained cæsium by heating CsAlO_{2}\r\nwith Mg([42 bis]).\r\n\r\n  [41] The salts of the majority of metals are precipitated as carbonates\r\n       on the addition of ammonium carbonate--for instance, the salts of\r\n       calcium, iron, &c. The alkalis whose carbonates are soluble are\r\n       not, however, precipitated in this case. On evaporating the\r\n       resultant solution and igniting the residue (to remove the\r\n       ammonium salts), we obtain salts of the alkali metals. They may he\r\n       separated by adding hydrochloric acid together with a solution of\r\n       platinic chloride. The chlorides of lithium and sodium give easily\r\n       soluble double salts with platinic chloride, whilst the chlorides\r\n       of potassium, rubidium, and cæsium form double salts which are\r\n       sparingly soluble. A hundred parts of water at 0° dissolve 0·74\r\n       part of the potassium platinochloride; the corresponding rubidium\r\n       platinochloride is only dissolved to the amount of 0·134 part, and\r\n       the cæsium salt, 0·024 part; at 100° 5·13 parts of potassium\r\n       platinochloride, K_{2}PtCl_{6}, are dissolved, 0·634 part of\r\n       rubidium platinochloride, and 0·177 part of cæsium\r\n       platinochloride. From this it is clear how the salts of rubidium\r\n       and cæsium may be isolated. The separation of cæsium from rubidium\r\n       by this method is very tedious. It can be better effected by\r\n       taking advantage of the difference of the solubility of their\r\n       carbonates in alcohol; cæsium carbonate, Cs_{2}CO_{3}, is soluble\r\n       in alcohol, whilst the corresponding salts of rubidium and\r\n       potassium are almost insoluble. Setterberg separated these metals\r\n       as alums, but the best method, that given by Scharples, is founded\r\n       on the fact that from a mixture of the chlorides of potassium,\r\n       sodium, cæsium, and rubidium in the presence of hydrochloric acid,\r\n       stannic chloride precipitates a double salt of cæsium, which is\r\n       very slightly soluble. The salts of Rb and Cs are closely\r\n       analogous to those of potassium.\r\n\r\n  [42] Bunsen obtained rubidium by distilling a mixture of the tartrate\r\n       with soot, and Beketoff (1888) by heating the hydroxide with\r\n       aluminium, 2RbHO + Al = RbAlO_{2} + H_{2} + Rb. By the action of\r\n       85 grams of rubidium on water, 94,000 heat units are evolved.\r\n       Setterberg obtained cæsium (1882) by the electrolysis of a fused\r\n       mixture of cyanide of cæsium and of barium. Winkler (1890) showed\r\n       that metallic magnesium reduces the hydrates and carbonates of Rb\r\n       and Cs like the other alkaline metals. N. N. Beketoff obtained\r\n       them with aluminium (see following note).\r\n\r\n  [42 bis] Beketoff (1888) showed that metallic aluminium reduces the\r\n       hydrates of the alkaline metals at a red heat (they should be\r\n       perfectly dry) with the formation of aluminates (Chapter XVII.),\r\n       RAlO_{2}--for example, 2KHO + Al = KAlO_{2} + K + H_{2}. It is\r\n       evident that in this case only half of the alkaline metal is\r\n       obtained free. On the other hand, K. Winkler (1889) showed that\r\n       magnesium powder is also able to reduce the alkaline metals from\r\n       their hydrates and carbonates. N. N. Beketoff and Tscherbacheff\r\n       (1894) prepared cæsium upon this principle by heating its\r\n       aluminate CsAlO_{2} with magnesium powder. In this case aluminate\r\n       of magnesium is formed, and the whole of the cæsium is obtained as\r\n       metal: 2CsAlO_{2} + Mg = MgOAl_{2}O_{5} + 2Cs. A certain excess of\r\n       alumina was taken (in order to obtain a less hygroscopic mass of\r\n       aluminate), and magnesium powder (in order to decompose the last\r\n       traces of water); the CsAlO_{2} was prepared by the precipitation\r\n       of cæsium alums by caustic baryta, and evaporating the resultant\r\n       solution. We may add that N. N. Beketoff (1887) prepared oxide of\r\n       potassium, K_{2}O, by heating the peroxide, KO, in the vapour of\r\n       potassium (disengaged from its alloy with silver), and showed that\r\n       in dissolving in an excess of water it evolves (for the\r\n       above-given molecular weight) 67,400 calories (while 2KHO in\r\n       dissolving in water evolves 24,920 cal.; so that K_{2}O + H_{2}O\r\n       gives 42,480 cal.), whence (knowing that K_{2} + O+H_{2}O in an\r\n       excess of water evolves 164,500) it follows that K_{2} + O evolves\r\n       97,100 cal. This quantity is somewhat less than that (100,260\r\n       cal.) which corresponds to sodium, and the energy of the action of\r\n       potassium upon water is explained by the fact that K_{2}O evolves\r\n       more heat than Na_{2}O in combining with water (_see_ Chapter II.\r\n       Note 9). Just as hydrogen displaces half the Na from Na_{2}O\r\n       forming NaHO, so also N. N. Beketoff found from experiment and\r\n       thermochemical reasonings that hydrogen displaces half the\r\n       potassium from K_{2}O forming KHO and evolving 7,190 calories.\r\n       Oxide of lithium, Li_{2}O, which is easily formed by igniting\r\n       Li_{2}CO_{3} with carbon (when Li_{2}O + 2CO is formed),\r\n       disengages 26,000 cals. with an excess of water, while the\r\n       reaction Li_{2} + O gives 114,000 cals. and the reaction Li_{2} +\r\n       H_{2}O gives only 13,000 cals., and metallic lithium cannot be\r\n       liberated from oxide of lithium with hydrogen (nor with carbon).\r\n       Thus in the series Li, Na, K, the formation of R_{2}O gives most\r\n       heat with Li and least with K, while the formation of RCl evolves\r\n       most heat with K (105,000 cals.) and least of all with Li (93,500\r\n       cals.). Rubidium, in forming Rb_{2}O, gives 94,000 cals.\r\n       (Beketoff). Cæsium, in acting upon an excess of water, evolves\r\n       51,500 cals., and the reaction Cs_{2} + O evolves about 100,000\r\n       cals.--_i.e._ more than K and Rb, and almost as much as Na--and\r\n       oxide of cæsium reacts with hydrogen (according to the equation\r\n       Cs_{2}O + H = CsHO + Cs) more easily than any of the oxides of the\r\n       alkali metals, and this reaction takes place at the ordinary\r\n       temperature (the hydrogen is absorbed), as Beketoff showed (1893).\r\n       He also obtained a mixed oxide, AgCsO, which was easily formed in\r\n       the presence of silver, and absorbed hydrogen with the formation\r\n       of CsHO.\r\n\r\nJudging by the properties of the free metals, and of their corresponding\r\nand even very complex compounds, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium,\r\nand cæsium present an indubitable chemical resemblance. The fact that\r\nthe metals easily decompose water, and that their hydroxides RHO and\r\ncarbonates R_{2}CO_{3} are soluble in water, whilst the hydroxides\r\nand carbonates of nearly all other metals are insoluble, shows that\r\nthese metals form a natural group of _alkali metals_. The halogens and\r\nthe alkali metals form, by their character, the two extremes of the\r\nelements. Many of the other elements are metals approaching the alkali\r\nmetals, both in their capacity of forming salts and in not forming acid\r\ncompounds, but are not so energetic as the alkali metals, that is, they\r\nform less energetic bases. Such are the common metals, silver, iron,\r\ncopper, &c. Some other elements, in the character of their compounds,\r\napproach the halogens, and, like them, combine with hydrogen, but these\r\ncompounds do not show the energetic property of the halogen acids; in\r\na free state they easily combine with metals, but they do not then\r\nform such saline compounds as the halogens do--in a word, the halogen\r\nproperties are less sharply defined in them than in the halogens\r\nthemselves. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, &c. belong to this order of\r\nelements. The clearest distinction of the properties of the halogens\r\nand alkali metals is expressed in the fact that the former give acids\r\nand do not form bases, whilst the latter, on the contrary, only give\r\nbases. The first are true _acid elements_, the latter clearly-defined\r\n_basic or metallic elements_. On combining together, the halogens form,\r\nin a chemical sense, unstable compounds, and the alkali metals alloys\r\nin which the character of the metals remains unaltered, just as in the\r\ncompound ICl the character of the halogens remains undisguised; thus\r\nboth classes of elements on combining with members of their own class\r\nform non-characteristic compounds, which have the properties of their\r\ncomponents. On the other hand, the halogens on combining with the alkali\r\nmetals form compounds which are, in all respects, stable, and in which\r\nthe original characters of the halogens and alkali metals have entirely\r\ndisappeared. The formation of such compounds is accompanied by evolution\r\nof a large amount of heat, and by an entire change of both the physical\r\nand chemical properties of the substances originally taken. The alloy of\r\nsodium and potassium, although liquid at the ordinary temperature, is\r\nperfectly metallic, like both its components. The compound of sodium and\r\nchlorine has neither the appearance nor the properties of the original\r\nelements; sodium chloride melts at a higher temperature, and is more\r\ndifficultly volatile, than either sodium or chlorine.\r\n\r\nWith all these qualitative differences there is, however, an important\r\nquantitative _resemblance between the halogens and the alkali metals_.\r\nThis resemblance is clearly expressed by stating that both orders of\r\nelements belong to those which are univalent with respect to hydrogen.\r\nIt is thus correct to say that both the above-named orders of elements\r\nreplace hydrogen atom for atom. Chlorine is able to take the place of\r\nhydrogen by metalepsis, and the alkali metals take the place of hydrogen\r\nin water and acids. As it is possible to consecutively replace every\r\nequivalent of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon by chlorine, so it is possible\r\nin an acid containing several equivalents of hydrogen to replace the\r\nhydrogen consecutively equivalent after equivalent by an alkali metal;\r\nhence an atom of these elements is analogous to an atom of hydrogen,\r\nwhich is taken, in all cases, as the unit for the comparison of the\r\nother elements. In ammonia, and in water, chlorine and sodium are\r\nable to bring about a direct replacement. According to the law of\r\nsubstitution, the formation of sodium chloride, NaCl, at once shows the\r\nequivalence of the atoms of the alkali metals and the halogens. The\r\nhalogens and hydrogen and the alkali metals combine with such elements\r\nas oxygen, and it is easily proved that in such compounds one atom\r\nof oxygen is able to retain two atoms of the halogens, of hydrogen,\r\nand of the alkali metals. For this purpose it is enough to compare\r\nthe compounds KHO, K_{2}O, HClO, and Cl_{2}O, with water. It must not\r\nbe forgotten, however, that the halogens give, with oxygen, besides\r\ncompounds of the type R_{2}O, higher acid grades of oxidation, which the\r\nalkali metals and hydrogen are not capable of forming. We shall soon\r\nsee that these relations are also subject to a special law, showing a\r\ngradual transition of the properties of the elements from the alkali\r\nmetals to the halogens.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] We may here observe that the halogens, and especially iodine,\r\n       may play the part of metals (hence iodine is more easily replaced\r\n       by metals than the other halogens, and it approaches nearer to the\r\n       metals in its physical properties than the other halogens).\r\n       Schützenberger obtained a compound C_{2}H_{3}O(OCl), which he\r\n       called chlorine acetate, by acting on acetic anhydride,\r\n       (C_{2}H_{3}O)_{2}O, with chlorine monoxide, Cl_{2}O. With iodine\r\n       this compound gives off chlorine and forms iodine acetate,\r\n       C_{2}H_{3}O(OI), which also is formed by the action of iodine\r\n       chloride on sodium acetate, C_{2}H_{3}O(ONa). These compounds are\r\n       evidently nothing else than mixed anhydrides of hypochlorous and\r\n       hypoiodous acids, or the products of the substitution of hydrogen\r\n       in RHO by a halogen (_see_ Chapter XI., Notes 29 and 78 bis). Such\r\n       compounds are very unstable, decompose with an explosion when\r\n       heated, and are changed by the action of water and of many other\r\n       reagents, which is in accordance with the fact that they contain\r\n       very closely allied elements, as does Cl_{2}O itself, or ICl or\r\n       KNa. By the action of chlorine monoxide on a mixture of iodine and\r\n       acetic anhydride, Schützenberger also obtained the compound\r\n       I(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{3}, which is analogous to ICl_{3}, because the\r\n       group C_{2}H_{3}O_{2} is, like Cl, a halogen, forming salts with\r\n       the metals. Similar properties are found in iodosobenzene (Chapter\r\n       XI., Note 79).\r\n\r\nThe atomic weights of the alkali metals, lithium 7, sodium 23, potassium\r\n39, rubidium 85, and cæsium 133, show that here, as in the class of\r\nhalogens, the elements may be arranged according to their atomic weights\r\nin order to compare the properties of the analogous compounds of the\r\nmembers of this group. Thus, for example, the platinochlorides of lithium\r\nand sodium are soluble in water; those of potassium, rubidium, and\r\ncæsium sparingly soluble, and the greater the atomic weight of the metal\r\nthe less soluble is the salt. In other cases the reverse is observed--the\r\ngreater the atomic weight the more soluble are the corresponding salts.\r\nThe variation of properties with the variation in atomic weights even\r\nshows itself in the metals themselves; thus lithium volatilises with\r\ndifficulty, whilst sodium is obtained by distillation, potassium\r\nvolatilises more easily than sodium, and rubidium and cæsium as we have\r\nseen, are still more volatile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n    THE VALENCY AND SPECIFIC HEAT OF THE METALS. MAGNESIUM. CALCIUM,\r\n                    STRONTIUM, BARIUM, AND BERYLLIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy by investigating the composition of corresponding compounds,\r\nto establish the _equivalent weights_ of the metals compared with\r\nhydrogen--that is, the quantity which replaces one part by weight of\r\nhydrogen. If a metal decomposes acids directly, with the evolution of\r\nhydrogen, the equivalent weight of the metal may be determined by taking\r\na definite weight of it and measuring the volume of hydrogen evolved by\r\nits action on an excess of acid; it is then easy to calculate the weight\r\nof the hydrogen from its volume.[1] The same result may be arrived at\r\nby determining the composition of the normal salts of the metal; for\r\ninstance, by finding the weight of metal which combines with 35·5 parts\r\nof chlorine or 80 parts of bromine.[2] The equivalent of a metal may be\r\nalso ascertained by simultaneously (_i.e._ in one circuit) decomposing\r\nan acid and a fused salt of a given metal by an electric current\r\nand determining the relation between the amounts of hydrogen and\r\nmetal separated, because, according to Faraday's law, electrolytes\r\n(conductors of the second order) are always decomposed in equivalent\r\nquantities.[2 bis] The equivalent of a metal may even be found by simply\r\ndetermining the relation between its weight and that of its salt-giving\r\noxide, as by this we know the quantity of the metal which combines with 8\r\nparts by weight of oxygen, and this will be the equivalent, because 8\r\nparts of oxygen combine with 1 part by weight of hydrogen. One method is\r\nverified by another, and all the processes for the accurate determination\r\nof equivalents require the greatest care to avoid the absorption of\r\nmoisture, further oxidation, volatility, and other accidental influences\r\nwhich affect exact weighings. The description of the methods necessary\r\nfor the attainment of exact results belongs to the province of analytical\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\n  [1] Under favourable circumstances (by taking all the requisite\r\n      precautions), the weight of the equivalent may be accurately\r\n      determined by this method. Thus Reynolds and Ramsay (1887)\r\n      determined the equivalent of zinc to be 32·7 by this method (from\r\n      the average of 29 experiments), whilst by other methods it has been\r\n      fixed (by different observers) between 32·55 and 33·95.\r\n\r\n      The differences in their equivalents may be demonstrated by taking\r\n      equal weights of different metals, and collecting the hydrogen\r\n      evolved by them (under the action of an acid or alkali).\r\n\r\n  [2] The most accurate determinations of this kind were carried on by\r\n      Stas, and will be described in Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n  [2 bis] The amount of electricity in one coulomb according to the\r\n      present nomenclature of electrical units (_see_ Works on Physics\r\n      and Electro-technology) disengages 0·00001036 gram of hydrogen,\r\n      0·00112 gram of silver, 0·0003263 gram of copper from the salts of\r\n      the oxide, and 0·0006526 gram from the salts of the suboxide, &c.\r\n      These amounts stand in the same ratio as the equivalents, _i.e._ as\r\n      the quantities replaced by one part by weight of hydrogen. The\r\n      intimate bond which is becoming more and more marked existing\r\n      between the electrolytic and purely chemical relations of\r\n      substances (especially in solutions) and the application of\r\n      electrolysis to the preparation of numerous substances on a large\r\n      scale, together with the employment of electricity for obtaining\r\n      high temperatures, &c., makes me regret that the plan and\r\n      dimensions of this book, and the impossibility of giving a concise\r\n      and objective exposition of the necessary electrical facts, prevent\r\n      my entering upon this province of knowledge, although I consider it\r\n      my duty to recommend its study to all those who desire to take part\r\n      in the further development of our science.\r\n\r\n      There is only one side of the subject respecting the direct\r\n      correlation between thermochemical data and electro-motive force,\r\n      which I think right to mention here, as it justifies the general\r\n      conception, enunciated by Faraday, that the galvanic current is an\r\n      aspect of the transference of chemical motion or reaction along the\r\n      conductors.\r\n\r\n      From experiments conducted by Favre, Thomsen, Garni, Berthelot,\r\n      Cheltzoff, and others, upon the amount of heat evolved in a closed\r\n      circuit, it follows that the electro-motive force of the current or\r\n      its capacity to do a certain work, E, is proportional to the whole\r\n      amount of heat, Q, disengaged by the reaction forming the source of\r\n      the current. If E be expressed in volts, and Q in thousands of\r\n      units of heat referred to equivalent weights, then E = 0·0436Q. For\r\n      example in a Daniells battery E = 1·09 both by experiment and\r\n      theory, because in it there takes place the decomposition of\r\n      CuSO_{4} into Cu + O together with the formation of Zn + O and ZnO\r\n      + SO_{3}Aq, and these reactions correspond to Q = 25·06 thousand\r\n      units of heat. So also in all other primary batteries (_e.g._\r\n      Bunsen's, Poggendorff's, &c.) and secondary ones (for instance,\r\n      those acting according to the reaction Pb + H_{2}SO_{4} + PbO_{2},\r\n      as Cheltzoff showed) E = 0·0436Q.\r\n\r\nFor univalent metals, like those of the alkalis, the weight of the\r\nequivalent is equal to the weight of the atom. For bivalent metals the\r\natomic weight is equal to the weight of two equivalents, for _n_-valent\r\nmetals it is equal to the weight of _n_ equivalents. Thus aluminium,\r\nAl = 27, is trivalent, that is, its equivalent = 9; magnesium, Mg =\r\n24, is bivalent, and its equivalent = 12. Therefore, if potassium or\r\nsodium, or in general a univalent metal, M, give compounds M_{2}O, MHO,\r\nMCl, MNO_{3}, M_{2}SO_{4}, &c., and in general MX, then for bivalent\r\nmetals like magnesium or calcium the corresponding compounds will be\r\nMgO, Mg(HO)_{2}, MgCl_{2}, Mg(NO_{3})_{2}, MgSO_{4}, &c., or in general\r\nMX_{2}.\r\n\r\nBy what are we to be guided in ascribing to some metals univalency and\r\nto others bi-, ter-, quadri-, ... _n_-valency? What obliges us to make\r\nthis difference? Why are not all metals given the same valency--for\r\ninstance, why is not magnesium considered as univalent? If this be\r\ndone, taking Mg = 12 (and not 24 as now), not only is a simplicity\r\nof expression of the composition of all the compounds of magnesium\r\nattained, but we also gain the advantage that their composition will\r\nbe the same as those of the corresponding compounds of sodium and\r\npotassium. These combinations were so expressed formerly--why has this\r\nsince been changed?\r\n\r\nThese questions could only be answered after the establishment of the\r\nidea of multiples of the atomic weights as the minimum quantities of\r\ncertain elements combining with others to form compounds--in a word,\r\nsince the time of the establishment of Avogadro-Gerhardt's law (Chapter\r\nVII.). By taking such an element as arsenic, which has many volatile\r\ncompounds, it is easy to determine the density of these compounds, and\r\ntherefore to establish their molecular weights, and hence to find the\r\nindubitable atomic weight, exactly as for oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine,\r\ncarbon, &c. It appears that As = 75, and its compounds correspond, like\r\nthe compounds of nitrogen, with the forms AsX_{3}, and AsX_{5}; for\r\nexample, AsH_{3}, AsCl_{3}, AsF_{5}, As_{2}O_{5}, &c. It is evident that\r\nwe are here dealing with a metal (or rather element) of two valencies,\r\nwhich moreover is never univalent, but tri- or quinqui-valent. This\r\nexample alone is sufficient for the recognition of the existence of\r\npolyvalent atoms among the metals. And as antimony and bismuth are\r\nclosely analogous to arsenic in all their compounds, (just as potassium\r\nis analogous to rubidium and cæsium); so, although very few volatile\r\ncompounds of bismuth are known, it was necessary to ascribe to them\r\nformulæ corresponding with those ascribed to arsenic.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see in describing them, there are also many analogous metals\r\namong the bivalent elements, some of which also give volatile compounds.\r\nFor example, zinc, which is itself volatile, gives several volatile\r\ncompounds (for instance, zinc ethyl, ZnC_{4}H_{10}, which boils at 118°,\r\nvapour density = 61·3), and in the molecules of all these compounds\r\nthere is never less than 65 parts of zinc, which is equivalent to H_{2},\r\nbecause 65 parts of zinc displace 2 parts by weight of hydrogen; so\r\nthat zinc is just such an example of the bivalent metals as oxygen,\r\nwhose equivalent = 8 (because H_{2} is replaced by O = 16), is a\r\nrepresentative of the bivalent elements, or as arsenic is of the tri-\r\nand quinqui-valent elements. And, as we shall afterwards see, magnesium\r\nis in many respects closely analogous to zinc, which fact obliges us to\r\nregard magnesium as a bivalent metal.\r\n\r\nSuch metals as mercury and copper, which are able to give not one but\r\ntwo bases, are of particular importance for distinguishing univalent and\r\nbivalent metals. Thus copper gives the suboxide Cu_{2}O and the oxide\r\nCuO--that is, the compounds CuX corresponding with the suboxide are\r\nanalogous (in the quantitative relations, by their composition) to NaX\r\nor AgX, and the compounds of the oxide CuX_{2}, to MgX_{2}, ZnX_{2}, and\r\nin general to the bivalent metals. It is clear that in such examples we\r\nmust make a distinction between atomic weights and equivalents.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the valency, that is, the number of equivalents entering\r\ninto the atom of the metals may in many cases be established by means\r\nof comparatively few volatile metallic compounds, with the aid of a\r\nsearch into their analogies (concerning which see Chapter XV.). _The law\r\nof specific heats_ discovered by Dulong and Petit has frequently been\r\napplied to the same purpose[3] in the history of chemistry, especially\r\nsince the development given to this law by the researches of Regnault,\r\nand since Cannizzaro (1860) showed the agreement between the deductions\r\nof this law and the consequences arising from Avogadro-Gerhardt's law.\r\n\r\n  [3] The chief means by which we determine the valency of the elements,\r\n      or what multiple of the equivalent should be ascribed to the atom,\r\n      are: (1) The law of Avogadro-Gerhardt. This method is the most\r\n      general and trustworthy, and has already been applied to a great\r\n      number of elements. (2) The different grades of oxidation and their\r\n      isomorphism or analogy in general; for example, Fe = 56 because the\r\n      suboxide (ferrous oxide) is isomorphous with magnesium oxide, &c.,\r\n      and the oxide (ferric oxide) contains half as much oxygen again as\r\n      the suboxide. Berzelius, Marignac, and others took advantage of\r\n      this method for determining the composition of the compounds of\r\n      many elements. (3) The specific heat, according to Dulong and\r\n      Petit's law. Regnault, and more especially Cannizzaro, used this\r\n      method to distinguish univalent from bivalent metals. (4) The\r\n      periodic law (_see_ Chapter XV.) has served as a means for the\r\n      determination of the atomic weights of cerium, uranium, yttrium,\r\n      &c., and more especially of gallium, scandium, and germanium. The\r\n      correction of the results of one method by those of others is\r\n      generally had recourse to, and is quite necessary, because,\r\n      phenomena of dissociation, polymerisation, &c., may complicate the\r\n      individual determinations by each method.\r\n\r\n      It will be well to observe that a number of other methods,\r\n      especially from the province of those physical properties which are\r\n      clearly dependent on the magnitude of the atom (or equivalent) or\r\n      of the molecule, may lead to the same result. I may point out, for\r\n      instance, that even the specific gravity of solutions of the\r\n      metallic chlorides may serve for this purpose. Thus, if beryllium\r\n      he taken as trivalent--that is, if the composition of its chloride\r\n      be taken as BeCl_{3} (or a polymeride of it), then the specific\r\n      gravity of solutions of beryllium chloride will not fit into the\r\n      series of the other metallic chlorides. But by ascribing to it an\r\n      atomic weight Be = 7, or taking Be as bivalent, and the composition\r\n      of its chloride as BeCl_{2}, we arrive at the general rule given in\r\n      Chapter VII., Note 28. Thus W. G. Burdakoff determined in my\r\n      laboratory that the specific gravity at 15°/4° of the solution\r\n      BeCl_{2} + 200H_{2}O = 1·0138--that is, greater than the\r\n      corresponding solution KCl + 200H_{2}O (= 1·0121), and less than\r\n      the solution MgCl_{2} + 200H_{2}O (= 1·0203), as would follow from\r\n      the magnitude of the molecular weight BeCl_{2} = 80, since KCl =\r\n      74·5 and MgCl_{2} = 95.\r\n\r\n\r\nDulong and Petit, having determined the specific heat of a number of\r\nsolid elementary substances, observed that as the atomic weights of the\r\nelements increase, their specific heats decrease, and that _the product\r\nof the specific heat Q into the atomic weight A is an almost constant\r\nquantity_. This means that to bring different elements into a known\r\nthermal state an equal amount of work is required if atomic quantities\r\nof the elements are taken; that is, the amounts of heat expended in\r\nheating equal quantities by weight of the elements are far from equal,\r\nbut are in inverse proportion to the atomic weights. For thermal\r\nchanges the atom is a unit; all atoms, notwithstanding the difference\r\nof weight and nature, are equal. This is the simplest expression of the\r\nfact discovered by Dulong and Petit. The specific heat measures that\r\nquantity of heat which is required to raise the temperature of _one\r\nunit of weight_ of a substance by one degree. If the magnitude of the\r\nspecific heat of elements be multiplied by the atomic weight, then we\r\nobtain the atomic heat--that is, the amount of heat required to raise\r\nthe temperature of the atomic weight of an element by one degree. It\r\nis these products which for the majority of the elements prove to be\r\napproximately, if not quite, identical. A complete identity cannot be\r\nexpected, because the specific heat of one and the same substance varies\r\nwith the temperature, with its passage from one state into another, and\r\nfrequently with even a simple mechanical change of density (for instance\r\nby hammering), not to speak of allotropic changes, &c. We will cite\r\nseveral figures[4] proving the truth of the conclusions arrived at by\r\nDulong and Petit with respect to solid elementary bodies.\r\n\r\n                          Li         Na        Mg        P\r\n                A =   7         23         24        31\r\n                Q =   0·9408     0·2934     0·245     0·202\r\n               AQ =   6·59       6·75       5·88      6·26\r\n\r\n                         Fe         Cu         Zn         Br\r\n                A =  56         63         65        80\r\n                Q =   0·112      0·093      0·093     0·0843\r\n               AQ =   6·27       5·86       6·04      6·74\r\n\r\n                          Pd        Ag         Sn         I\r\n                A = 106        108        118       127\r\n                Q =   0·0592     0·056      0·055     0·541\r\n               AQ =   6·28       6·05       6·49      6·87\r\n\r\n                          Pt         Au         Hg        Pb\r\n                A = 196        198        200       206\r\n                Q =   0·0325     0·0324     0·0333    0·0315\r\n               AQ =   6·37       6·41       6·66      6·49\r\n\r\n  [4] The specific heats here given refer to different limits of\r\n      temperature, but in the majority of cases between 0° and 100°; only\r\n      in the case of bromine the specific heat is taken (for the solid\r\n      state) at a temperature below -7°, according to Regnault's\r\n      determination. _The variation of the specific heat with a change of\r\n      temperature_ is a very complex phenomenon, the consideration of\r\n      which I think would here be out of place. I will only cite a few\r\n      figures as an example. According to Bystrom, the specific heat of\r\n      iron at 0° = 0·1116, at 100° = 0·1114, at 200° = 0·1188, at 300° =\r\n      0·1267, and at 1,400° = 0·4031. Between these last limits of\r\n      temperature a change takes place in iron (a spontaneous heating,\r\n      _recalescence_), as we shall see in Chapter XXII. For quartz\r\n      SiO_{2} Pionchon gives Q = 0·1737 + 394_t_10^{-6}-27_t_^{2}10^{-9}\r\n      up to 400°, for metallic aluminium (Richards, 1892) at 0° 0·222, at\r\n      20° 0·224, at 100° 0·232; consequently, as a rule, the specific\r\n      heat varies slightly with the temperature. Still more remarkable\r\n      are H. E. Weber's observations on the great variation of the\r\n      specific heat of charcoal, the diamond and boron:\r\n\r\n                               0°   100°  200°  600°  900°\r\n               Wood charcoal  0·15  0·23  0·29  0·44  0·46\r\n               Diamond        0·10  0·19  0·22  0·44  0·45\r\n               Boron          0·22  0·29  0·35    --    --\r\n\r\n      These determinations, which have been verified by Dewar, Le\r\n      Chatelier (Chapter VIII., Note 13), Moissan, and Gauthier, the\r\n      latter finding for boron AQ = 6 at 400°, are of especial importance\r\n      as confirming the universality of Dulong and Petit's law, because\r\n      the elements mentioned above form exceptions to the general rule\r\n      when the mean specific heat is taken for temperatures between 0°\r\n      and 100°. Thus in the case of the diamond the product of A × Q at\r\n      0° = 1·2, and for boron = 2·4. But if we take the specific heat\r\n      towards which there is evidently a tendency with a rise of\r\n      temperature, we obtain a product approaching to 6 as with other\r\n      elements. Thus with the diamond and charcoal, it is evident that\r\n      the specific heat tends towards 0·47, which multiplied by 12 gives\r\n      5·6, the same as for magnesium and aluminium. I may here direct the\r\n      reader's attention to the fact that for solid elements having a\r\n      small atomic weight, the specific heat varies considerably if we\r\n      take the average figures for temperatures 0° to 100°:\r\n\r\n                      Li = 7    Be = 9    B = 11    C = 12\r\n                  Q =  0·94      0·42      0·24      0·20\r\n                 AQ =  6·6       3·8       2·6       2·4\r\n\r\n      It is therefore clear that the specific heat of beryllium\r\n      determined at a low temperature cannot serve for establishing its\r\n      atomicity. On the other hand, the low atomic heat of charcoal,\r\n      graphite, and the diamond, boron, &c., may perhaps depend on the\r\n      complexity of the molecules of these elements. The necessity for\r\n      acknowledging a great complexity of the molecules of carbon was\r\n      explained in Chapter VIII. In the case of sulphur the molecule\r\n      contains at least S_{6} and its atomic heat = 32 × 0·163 = 5·22,\r\n      which is distinctly below the normal. If a large number of atoms of\r\n      carbon are contained in the molecule of charcoal, this would to a\r\n      certain extent account for its comparatively small atomic heat.\r\n      With respect to the specific heat of compounds, it will not be out\r\n      of place to mention here the conclusion arrived at by Kopp, that\r\n      the molecular heat (that is, the product of MQ) may be looked on as\r\n      the sum of the atomic heats of its component elements; but as this\r\n      rule is not a general one, and can only be applied to give an\r\n      approximate estimate of the specific heats of substances, I do not\r\n      think it necessary to go into the details of the conclusions\r\n      described in Liebig's 'Annalen Supplement-Band,' 1864, which\r\n      includes a number of determinations made by Kopp.\r\n\r\nIt is seen from this that the product of the specific heat of the element\r\ninto the atomic weight is an almost constant quantity, which is nearly 6.\r\nHence it is possible to determine the valency by the specific heats of\r\nthe metals. Thus, for instance, the specific heats of lithium, sodium,\r\nand potassium convince us of the fact that their atomic weights are\r\nindeed those which we chose, because by multiplying the specific heats\r\nfound by experiment by the corresponding atomic weights we obtain the\r\nfollowing figures: Li, 6·59, Na, 6·75 and K, 6·47. Of the alkaline earth\r\nmetals the specific heats have been determined: of magnesium = 0·245\r\n(Regnault and Kopp), of calcium = 0·170 (Bunsen), and of barium = 0·05\r\n(Mendeléeff). If the same composition be ascribed to the compounds of\r\nmagnesium as to the corresponding compounds of potassium, then the\r\nequivalent of magnesium will be equal to 12. On multiplying this atomic\r\nweight by the specific heat of magnesium, we obtain a figure 2·94, which\r\nis half that which is given by the other solid elements and therefore the\r\natomic weight of magnesium must be taken as equal to 24 and not to 12.\r\nThen the atomic heat of magnesium = 24 × 0·245 = 5·9; for calcium, giving\r\nits compounds a composition CaX_{2}--for example CaCl_{2}, CaSO_{4}, CaO\r\n(Ca = 40)--we obtain an atomic heat = 40 × 0·17 = 6·8, and for barium it\r\nis equal to 137 × 0·05 = 6·8; that is, they must be counted as bivalent,\r\nor that their atom replaces H_{2}, Na_{2}, or K_{2}. This conclusion may\r\nbe confirmed by a method of analogy, as we shall afterwards see. The\r\napplication of the principle of specific heats to the determination of\r\nthe magnitudes of the atomic weights of those metals, the magnitude of\r\nwhose atomic weights could not be determined by Avogadro-Gerhardt's law,\r\nwas made about 1860 by the Italian professor Cannizzaro.\r\n\r\nExactly the same conclusions respecting the bivalence of magnesium and\r\nits analogues are obtained by comparing the specific heats of their\r\ncompounds, especially of the halogen compounds as the most simple,\r\nwith the specific heats of the corresponding alkali compounds. Thus,\r\nfor instance, the specific heats of magnesium and calcium chlorides,\r\nMgCl_{2} and CaCl_{2}, are 0·194 and 0·164, and of sodium and potassium\r\nchlorides, NaCl and KCl, 0·214 and 0·172, and therefore their molecular\r\nheats (or the products QM, where M is the weight of the molecule)\r\nare 18·4 and 18·2, 12·5 and 12·8, and hence the atomic heats (or the\r\nquotient of QM by the number of atoms) are all nearly 6, as with the\r\nelements. Whilst if, instead of the actual atomic weights Mg = 24 and\r\nCa = 40, their equivalents 12 and 20 be taken, then the atomic heats of\r\nthe chlorides of magnesium and calcium would be about 4·6, whilst those\r\nof potassium and sodium chlorides are about 6·3.[5] We must remark,\r\nhowever, that as the specific heat or the amount of heat required to\r\nraise the temperature of a unit of weight one degree[6] is a complex\r\nquantity--including not only the increase of the energy of a substance\r\nwith its rise in temperature, but also the external work of expansion[7]\r\nand the internal work accomplished in the molecules causing them to\r\ndecompose according to the rise of temperature[8]--therefore it is\r\nimpossible to expect in the magnitude of the specific heat the great\r\nsimplicity of relation to composition which we see, for instance, in\r\nthe density of gaseous substances. Hence, although the specific heat\r\nis one of the important means for determining the atomicity of the\r\nelements, still the mainstay for a true judgment of atomicity is only\r\ngiven by Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, _i.e._ this other method can only be\r\naccessory or preliminary, and when possible recourse should be had to\r\nthe determination of the vapour density.\r\n\r\n  [5] It must be remarked that in the case of oxygen (and also hydrogen\r\n      and carbon) compounds the quotient of MQ/_n_, where _n_ is the\r\n      number of atoms in the molecule, is always less than 6 for solids;\r\n      for example, for MgO = 5·0, CuO = 5·1, MnO_{2} = 4·6, ice (Q =\r\n      0·504) = 3, SiO_{2} = 3·5, &c. At present it is impossible to say\r\n      whether this depends on the smaller specific heat of the atom of\r\n      oxygen in its solid compounds (Kopp, Note 4) or on some other\r\n      cause; but, nevertheless, taking into account this decrease\r\n      depending on the presence of oxygen, a reflection of the atomicity\r\n      of the elements may to a certain extent be seen in the specific\r\n      heat of the oxides. Thus for alumina, Al_{2}O_{3} (Q = 0·217), MQ =\r\n      22·3, and therefore the quotient MQ/_n_ = 4·5, which is nearly that\r\n      given by magnesium oxide, MgO. But if we ascribe the same\r\n      composition to alumina, as to magnesia--that is, if aluminium were\r\n      counted as divalent--we should obtain the figure 3·7, which is much\r\n      less. In general, in compounds of identical atomic composition and\r\n      of analogous chemical properties the molecular heats MQ are nearly\r\n      equal, as many investigators have long remarked. For example, ZnS =\r\n      11·7 and HgS = 11·8; MgSO_{4} = 27·0 and ZnSO_{4} = 28·0, &c.\r\n\r\n  [6] If W be the amount of heat contained in a mass _m_ of a substance\r\n      at a temperature _t_, and _d_W the amount expended in heating it\r\n      from _t_ to _t_ + _dt_, then the specific heat Q = _d_W(_m_ ×\r\n      _dt_). The specific heat not only varies with the composition and\r\n      complexity of the molecules of a substance, but also with the\r\n      temperature, pressure, and physical state of a substance. Even for\r\n      gases the variation of Q with _t_ is to be observed. Thus it is\r\n      seen from the experiments of Regnault and Wiedemann that the\r\n      specific heat of carbonic anhydride at 0° = 0·19, at 100° = 0·22,\r\n      and at 200° = 0·24. But the variation of the specific heat of\r\n      permanent gases with the temperature is, as far as we know, very\r\n      inconsiderable. According to Mallard and Le Chatelier it is =\r\n      0·0006/M per 1°, where M is the molecular weight (for instance, for\r\n      O_{2}, M = 32). Therefore the specific heat of those permanent\r\n      gases which contain two atoms in the molecule (H_{2}, O_{2}, N_{2},\r\n      CO, and NO) may be, as is shown by experiment, taken as not varying\r\n      with the temperature. The constancy of the specific heat of perfect\r\n      gases forms one of the fundamental propositions of the whole theory\r\n      of heat and on it depends the determination of temperatures by\r\n      means of gas-thermometers containing hydrogen, nitrogen, or air. Le\r\n      Chatelier (1887), on the basis of existing determinations,\r\n      concludes that the molecular heat--that is, the product MQ--of all\r\n      gases varies in proportion to the temperature, and tends to become\r\n      equal (= 6·8) at the temperature of absolute zero (that is,\r\n      at -273°); and therefore MQ = 6·8 + _a_(273 + _t_), where _a_ is a\r\n      constant quantity which increases with the complexity of the\r\n      gaseous molecule and Q is the specific heat of the gas under a\r\n      constant pressure. For permanent gases _a_ almost = 0, and\r\n      therefore MQ = 6·8--that is, the atomic heat (if the molecule\r\n      contains two atoms) = 3·4, as it is in fact (Chapter IX., Note\r\n      17 bis). As regards liquids (as well as the vapours formed by\r\n      them), the specific heat always rises with the temperature. Thus\r\n      for benzene it equals 0·38 + 0·0014_t_. R. Schiff (1887) showed\r\n      that the variation of the specific heat of many organic liquids is\r\n      proportional to the change of temperature (as in the case of gases,\r\n      according to Le Chatelier), and reduced these variations into\r\n      dependence with their composition and absolute boiling point. It is\r\n      very probable that the theory of liquids will make use of these\r\n      simple relations which recall the simplicity of the variation of\r\n      the specific gravity (Chapter II., Note 34), cohesion, and other\r\n      properties of liquids with the temperature. They are all expressed\r\n      by the linear function of the temperature, _a_ + _bt_, with the\r\n      same degree of proximity as the property of gases is expressed by\r\n      the equation _pv_ = _Rt_.\r\n\r\n      As regards the relation between the specific heats of liquids (or\r\n      of solids) and of their vapours, the specific heat of the vapour\r\n      (and also of the solid) is always less than that of the liquid. For\r\n      example, benzene vapour 0·22, liquid 0·38; chloroform vapour 0·13,\r\n      liquid 0·23; steam 0·475, liquid water 1·0. But the complexity of\r\n      the relations existing in specific heat is seen from the fact that\r\n      the specific heat of ice = 0·502 is less than that of liquid water.\r\n      According to Regnault, in the case of bromine the specific heat of\r\n      the vapour = 0·055 at (150°), of the liquid = 0·107 (at 30°), and\r\n      of solid bromine = 0·084 (at -15°). The specific heat of solid\r\n      benzoic acid (according to experiment and calculation, Hess, 1888)\r\n      between 0° and 100° is 0·31, and of liquid benzoic acid 0·50. One\r\n      of the problems of the present day is the explanation of those\r\n      complex relations which exist between the composition and such\r\n      properties as specific heat, latent heat, expansion by heat,\r\n      compression, internal friction, cohesion, and so forth. They can\r\n      only be connected by a complete theory of liquids, which may now\r\n      soon be expected, more especially as many sides of the subject have\r\n      already been partially explained.\r\n\r\n  [7] According to the above reasons the quantity of heat, Q, required to\r\n      raise the temperature of one part by weight of a substance by one\r\n      degree may be expressed by the sum Q = K + B + D, where K is the\r\n      heat actually expended in heating the substance, or what is termed\r\n      the absolute specific heat, B the amount of heat expended in the\r\n      internal work accomplished with the rise of temperature, and D the\r\n      amount of heat expended in external work. In the case of gases the\r\n      last quantity may be easily determined, knowing their coefficient\r\n      of expansion, which is approximately = 0·00368. By applying to this\r\n      case the same argument given at the end of Note 11, Chapter I., we\r\n      find that one cubic metre of a gas heated 1° produces an external\r\n      work of 10333 × 0·00368, or 38·02 kilogrammetres, on which\r\n      38·02/424 or 0·0897 heat units are expended. This is the heat\r\n      expended for the external work produced by one cubic metre of a\r\n      gas, but the specific heat refers to units of weight, and therefore\r\n      it is necessary in order to know D to reduce the above quantity to\r\n      a unit of weight. One cubic metre of hydrogen at 0° and 760 mm.\r\n      pressure weighs 0·0896 kilo, a gas of molecular weight M has a\r\n      density M/2, consequently a cubic metre weighs (at 0° and 760 mm.)\r\n      0·0448M kilo, and therefore 1 kilogram of the gas occupies a volume\r\n      1/0·0448M cubic metres, and hence the external work D in the\r\n      heating of 1 kilo of the given gas through 1° = 0·0896/0·0448M, or\r\n      D = 2/M.\r\n\r\n      Taking the magnitude of the internal work B for gases as negligible\r\n      if permanent gases are taken, and therefore supposing B = 0, we\r\n      find the specific heat of gases at a constant pressure Q = K + 2 M,\r\n      where K is the specific heat at a constant volume, or the true\r\n      specific heat, and M the molecular weight. Hence K = Q-2/M. The\r\n      magnitude of the specific heat Q is given by direct experiment.\r\n      According to Regnault's experiments, for oxygen it = 0·2175, for\r\n      hydrogen 3·405, for nitrogen 0·2438; the molecular weights of these\r\n      gases are 32, 2, and 28, and therefore for oxygen K = 0·2175-0·0625\r\n      = 0·1550, for hydrogen K = 3·4050-1·000 = 2·4050, and for nitrogen\r\n      K = 0·2438-0·0714 = 0·1724. These true specific heats of elements\r\n      are in inverse proportion to their atomic weights--that is, their\r\n      product by the atomic weight is a constant quantity. In fact, for\r\n      oxygen this product = 0·155 × 16 = 2·48, for hydrogen 2·40, for\r\n      nitrogen 0·7724 × 14 = 2·414, and therefore if A stand for the\r\n      atomic weight we obtain the expression K × A = a constant, which\r\n      may be taken as 2·45. This is the true expression of Dulong and\r\n      Petit's law, because K is the true specific heat and A the weight\r\n      of the atom. It should be remarked, moreover, that the product of\r\n      the observed specific heat Q into A is also a constant quantity\r\n      (for oxygen = 3·48, for hydrogen = 3·40), because the external work\r\n      D is also inversely proportional to the atomic weight.\r\n\r\n      In the case of gases we distinguish the specific heat at a constant\r\n      pressure _c´_ (we designated this quantity above by Q), and at a\r\n      constant volume _c_. It is evident that _the relation between the\r\n      two specific heats, k_, judging from the above, is the ratio of Q\r\n      to K, or equal to the ratio of 2·45_n_ + 2 to 2·45_n_. When _n_ = 1\r\n      this ratio _k_ = 1·8; when _n_ = 2, _k_ = 1·4, when _n_ = 3, _k_ =\r\n      1·3, and with an exceedingly large number _n_, of atoms in the\r\n      molecule, _k_ = 1. That is, the ratio between the specific heats\r\n      decreases from 1·8 to 1·0 as the number of atoms, _n_, contained in\r\n      the molecule increases. This deduction is verified to a certain\r\n      extent by direct experiment. For such gases as hydrogen, oxygen,\r\n      nitrogen, carbonic oxide, air, and others in which _n_ = 2, the\r\n      magnitude of _k_ is determined by methods described in works on\r\n      physics (for example, by the change of temperature with an\r\n      alteration of pressure, by the velocity of sound, &c.) and is found\r\n      in reality to be nearly 1·4, and for such gases as carbonic\r\n      anhydride, nitric dioxide, and others it is nearly 1·3. Kundt and\r\n      Warburg (1875), by means of the approximate method mentioned in\r\n      Note 29, Chapter VII., determined _k_ for mercury vapour when _n_ =\r\n      1, and found it to be = 1·67--that is, a larger quantity than for\r\n      air, as would be expected from the above.\r\n\r\n      It may be admitted that the true atomic heat of gases = 2·43, only\r\n      under the condition that they are distant from a liquid state, and\r\n      do not undergo a chemical change when heated--that is, when no\r\n      internal work is produced in them (B = 0). Therefore this work may\r\n      to a certain extent be judged by the observed specific heat. Thus,\r\n      for instance, for chlorine (Q = 0·12, Regnault; _k_ = 1·33,\r\n      according to Straker and Martin, and therefore K = 0·09, MK = 6·4),\r\n      the atomic heat (3·2) is much greater than for other gases\r\n      containing two atoms in a molecule, and it must be assumed,\r\n      therefore, that when it is heated some great internal work is\r\n      accomplished.\r\n\r\n      In order to generalise the facts concerning the specific heat of\r\n      gases and solids, it appears to me possible to accept the following\r\n      general proposition: _the atomic heat_ (that is, AQ or QM/_n_,\r\n      where M is the molecular weight and _n_ the number of molecules) is\r\n      _smaller_ (in solids it attains its highest value 6·8 and in gases\r\n      3·4), _the more complex the molecule_ (i.e. _the greater the number\r\n      (n) of atoms forming it_) _and so much smaller, up to a certain\r\n      point_ (in similar physical states) _the smaller the mean atomic\r\n      weight M/n_.\r\n\r\n  [8] As an example, it will be sufficient to refer to the specific heat\r\n      of nitrogen tetroxide, N_{2}O_{4}, which, when heated, gradually\r\n      passes into NO_{2}--that is, chemical work of decomposition\r\n      proceeds, which consumes heat. Speaking generally, specific heat is\r\n      a complex quantity, in which it is clear that thermal data (for\r\n      instance, the heat of reaction) alone cannot give an idea either of\r\n      chemical or of physical changes individually, but always depend on\r\n      an association of the one and the other. If a substance be heated\r\n      from _t__{0} to _t__{1} it cannot but suffer a chemical change\r\n      (that is, the state of the atoms in the molecules changes more or\r\n      less in one way or another) if dissociation sets in at a\r\n      temperature _t__{1}. Even in the case of the elements whose\r\n      molecules contain only one atom, a true chemical change is possible\r\n      with a rise of temperature, because more heat is evolved in\r\n      chemical reactions than that quantity which participates in purely\r\n      physical changes. One gram of hydrogen (specific heat = 3·4 at a\r\n      constant pressure) cooled to the temperature of absolute zero will\r\n      evolve altogether about one thousand units of heat, 8 grams of\r\n      oxygen half this amount, whilst in combining together they evolve\r\n      in the formation of 9 grams of water more than thirty times as much\r\n      heat. Hence the store of chemical energy (that is, of the motion of\r\n      the atoms, vortex, or other) is much greater than the physical\r\n      store proper to the molecules, but it is the change accomplished by\r\n      the former that is the cause of chemical transformations. Here we\r\n      evidently touch on those limits of existing knowledge beyond which\r\n      the teaching of science does not yet allow us to pass. Many new\r\n      scientific discoveries have still to be made before this is\r\n      possible.\r\n\r\nAmong the bivalent metals the first place, with respect to their\r\ndistribution in nature, is occupied by _magnesium_ and _calcium_, just as\r\nsodium and potassium stand first amongst the univalent metals. The\r\nrelation which exists between the atomic weights of these four metals\r\nconfirms the above comparison. In fact, the combining weight of magnesium\r\nis equal to 24, and of calcium 40; whilst the combining weights of sodium\r\nand potassium are 23 and 39--that is, the latter are one unit less than\r\nthe former.[9] They all belong to the number of _light metals_, as they\r\nhave but a small specific gravity, in which respect they differ from the\r\nordinary, generally known heavy, or ore, metals (for instance, iron,\r\ncopper, silver, and lead), which are distinguished by a much greater\r\nspecific gravity. There is no doubt that their low specific gravity has a\r\nsignificance, not only as a simple point of distinction, but also as a\r\nproperty which determines the fundamental properties of these metals.\r\nIndeed, all the light metals have a series of points of resemblance with\r\nthe metals of the alkalis; thus both magnesium and calcium, like the\r\nmetals of the alkalis, decompose water (without the addition of acids),\r\nalthough not so easily as the latter metals. The process of the\r\ndecomposition is essentially one and the same; for example, Ca + 2H_{2}O\r\n= CaH_{2}O_{2} + H_{2}--that is, hydrogen is liberated and a hydroxide of\r\nthe metal formed. These hydroxides are bases which neutralise nearly all\r\nacids. However, the hydroxides RH_{2}O_{2} of calcium and magnesium are\r\nin no respect so energetic as the hydroxides of the true metals of the\r\nalkalis; thus when heated they lose water, are not so soluble, develop\r\nless heat with acids, and form various salts, which are less stable and\r\nmore easily decomposed by heat than the corresponding salts of sodium and\r\npotassium. Thus calcium and magnesium carbonates easily part with\r\ncarbonic anhydride when ignited; the nitrates are also very easily\r\ndecomposed by heat, calcium and magnesium oxides, CaO and MgO, being left\r\nbehind. The chlorides of magnesium and calcium, when heated with water,\r\nevolve hydrogen chloride, forming the corresponding hydroxides, and when\r\nignited the oxides themselves. All these points are evidence of a\r\nweakening of the alkaline properties.\r\n\r\n  [9] As if NaH = Mg and KH = Ca, which is in accordance with their\r\n      valency. KH includes two monovalent elements, and is a bivalent\r\n      group like Ca.\r\n\r\nThese metals have been termed _the metals of the alkaline earths_,\r\nbecause they, like the alkali metals, form energetic bases. They are\r\ncalled alkaline _earths_ because they are met with in nature in a state\r\nof combination, forming the insoluble mass of the earth, and because as\r\noxides, RO, they themselves have an earthy appearance. Not a few salts of\r\nthese metals are known which are insoluble in water, whilst the\r\ncorresponding salts of the alkali metals are generally soluble--for\r\nexample, the carbonates, phosphates, borates, and other salts of the\r\nalkaline earth metals are nearly insoluble. This enables us to separate\r\nthe metals of the alkaline earths from the metals of the alkalis. For\r\nthis purpose a solution of ammonium carbonate is added to a mixed\r\nsolution of salts of both kinds of metals, when by a double decomposition\r\nthe insoluble carbonates of the metals of the alkaline earths are formed\r\nand fall as a precipitate, whilst the metals of the alkalis remain in\r\nsolution: RX_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = RCO_{3} + 2NaX.\r\n\r\nWe may here remark that the oxides of the metals of the alkaline earths\r\nare frequently called by special names: MgO is called magnesia or bitter\r\nearth; CaO, lime; SrO, strontia; and BaO, baryta.\r\n\r\nIn the primary rocks the oxides of calcium and magnesium are combined\r\nwith silica, sometimes in variable quantities, so that in some cases\r\nthe lime predominates and in other cases the magnesium. The two oxides,\r\nbeing analogous to each other, replace each other in equivalent\r\nquantities. The various forms of _augite_, _hornblende_, or _amphibole_,\r\nand of similar minerals, which enter into the composition of nearly\r\nall rocks, contain lime and magnesia and silica. The majority of the\r\nprimary rocks also contain alumina, potash, and soda. These rocks,\r\nunder the action of water (containing carbonic acid) and air, give\r\nup lime and magnesia to the water, and therefore they are contained\r\nin all kinds of water, and especially in sea-water. The _carbonates_\r\nCaCO_{3} and MgCO_{3}, frequently met with in nature, _are soluble\r\nin an excess of water saturated with carbonic anhydride_,[10] and\r\ntherefore many natural waters contain these salts, and are able to\r\nyield them when evaporated. However, one kilogram of water saturated\r\nwith carbonic anhydride does not dissolve more than three grams of\r\ncalcium carbonate. By gradually expelling the carbonic anhydride from\r\nsuch water, an insoluble precipitate of calcium carbonate separates\r\nout. It may confidently be stated that the formation of the very widely\r\ndistributed strata of calcium and magnesium carbonates was of this\r\nnature, because these strata are of a sedimentary character--that is,\r\nsuch as would be exhibited by a gradually accumulating deposit on the\r\nbottom of the sea, and, moreover, frequently containing the remains of\r\nmarine plants, and animals, shells, &c. It is very probable that the\r\npresence of these organisms in the sea has played the chief part in the\r\nprecipitation of the carbonates from the sea water, because the plants\r\nabsorb CO_{2}, and many of the organisms CaCO_{3}, and after death give\r\ndeposits of carbonate of lime; for instance, chalk, which is almost\r\nentirely composed of the minute remains of the calcareous shields of\r\nsuch organisms. These deposits of calcium and magnesium carbonates are\r\nthe most important sources of these metals. Lime generally predominates,\r\nbecause it is present in rocks and running water in greater quantity\r\nthan magnesia, and in this case these sedimentary rocks are termed\r\n_limestone_. Some common flagstones used for paving, &c., and chalk may\r\nbe taken as examples of this kind of formation. Those limestones in\r\nwhich a considerable portion of the calcium is replaced by magnesium are\r\ntermed _dolomites_. The dolomites are distinguished by their hardness,\r\nand by their not parting with the whole of their carbonic anhydride\r\nso easily as the limestones under the action of acids. Dolomites[11]\r\nsometimes contain an equal number of molecules of calcium carbonate and\r\nmagnesium carbonate, and they also sometimes appear in a crystalline\r\nform, which is easily intelligible, because calcium carbonate itself\r\nis exceedingly common in this form in nature, and is then known as\r\n_calc spar_, whilst natural crystalline magnesium carbonate is termed\r\n_magnesite_. The formation of the crystalline varieties of the insoluble\r\ncarbonates is explained by the possibility of a slow deposition from\r\nsolutions containing carbonic acid. Besides which (Chapter X.) calcium\r\nand magnesium sulphates are obtained from sea water, and therefore they\r\nare met with both as deposits and in springs. It must be observed that\r\nmagnesium is held in considerable quantities in sea water, because the\r\nsulphate and chloride of magnesium are very soluble in water, whilst\r\ncalcium sulphate is but little soluble, and is used in the formation\r\nof shells; and therefore if the occurrence of considerable deposits of\r\nmagnesium sulphate cannot be expected in nature, still, on the other\r\nhand, one would expect (and they do actually occur) large masses of\r\ncalcium sulphate or _gypsum_, CaSO_{4},2H_{2}O. Gypsum sometimes forms\r\nstrata of immense size, which extend over many hectometres--for example,\r\nin Russia on the Volga, and in the Donetz and Baltic provinces.\r\n\r\n  [10] Sodium carbonate and other carbonates of the alkalis give acid\r\n       salts which are less soluble than the normal; here, on the\r\n       contrary, with an excess of carbonic anhydride, a salt is formed\r\n       which is more soluble than the normal, but this acid salt is more\r\n       unstable than sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO_{3}.\r\n\r\n  [11] The formation of dolomite may be explained, if only we imagine\r\n       that a solution of a magnesium salt acts on calcium carbonate.\r\n       Magnesium carbonate may be formed by double decomposition, and it\r\n       must be supposed that this process ceases at a certain limit\r\n       (Chapter XII.), when we shall obtain a mixture of the carbonates\r\n       of calcium and magnesium. Haitinger heated a mixture of calcium\r\n       carbonate, CaCO_{3}, with a solution of an equivalent quantity of\r\n       magnesium sulphate, MgSO_{4}, in a closed tube at 200°, and then a\r\n       portion of the magnesia actually passed into the state of\r\n       magnesium carbonate, MgCO_{3}, and a portion of the lime was\r\n       converted into gypsum, CaSO_{4}. Lubavin (1892) showed that\r\n       MgCO_{3} is more soluble than CaCO_{3} in salt water, which is of\r\n       some significance in explaining the composition of sea water.\r\n\r\nLime and magnesia also, but in much smaller quantities (only to the\r\namount of several fractions of a per cent. and rarely more), enter into\r\nthe composition of every fertile soil, and without these bases the soil\r\nis unable to support vegetation. Lime is particularly important in this\r\nrespect, and its presence in a larger quantity generally improves the\r\nharvest, although purely calcareous soils are as a rule infertile. For\r\nthis reason the soil is fertilised both with lime[12] itself and with\r\nmarl--that is, with clay mixed with a certain quantity of calcium\r\ncarbonate, strata of which are found nearly everywhere.\r\n\r\n  [12] The undoubted action of lime in increasing the fertility of\r\n       soils--if not in every case, at all events, with ordinary soils\r\n       which have long been under corn--is based not so much on the need\r\n       of plants for the lime itself as on those chemical and physical\r\n       changes which it produces in the soil, as a particularly powerful\r\n       base which aids the alteration of the mineral and organic elements\r\n       of the soil.\r\n\r\nFrom the soil the lime and magnesia (in a smaller quantity) pass into the\r\nsubstance of _plants_, where they occur as salts. Certain of these salts\r\nseparate in the interior of plants in a crystalline form--for example,\r\ncalcium oxalate. The lime occurring in plants serves as the source for\r\nthe formation of the various calcareous secretions which are so common in\r\n_animals_ of all classes. The bones of the highest animal orders, the\r\nshells of mollusca, the covering of the sea-urchin, and similar solid\r\nsecretions of sea animals, contain calcium salts; namely, the shells\r\nmainly calcium carbonate, and the bones mainly calcium phosphate. Certain\r\nlimestones are almost entirely formed of such deposits. Odessa is\r\nsituated on a limestone of this kind, composed of shells. Thus magnesium\r\nand calcium occur throughout the entire realm of nature, but calcium\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nAs lime and magnesia form bases which are in many respects analogous,\r\nthey were not distinguished from each other for a long time. Magnesia\r\nwas obtained for the first time in the seventeenth century from Italy,\r\nand used as a medicine; and it was only in the last century that Black,\r\nBergmann, and others distinguished magnesia from lime.\r\n\r\n_Metallic magnesium_ (and calcium also) is not obtained by heating\r\nmagnesium oxide or the carbonate with charcoal, as the alkali metals\r\nare obtained,[13] but is liberated by the action of a galvanic current\r\non fused magnesium chloride (best mixed with potassium chloride); Davy\r\nand Bussy obtained metallic magnesium by acting on magnesium chloride\r\nwith the vapours of potassium. At the present time (Deville's process)\r\nmagnesium is prepared in rather considerable quantities by a similar\r\nprocess, only the potassium is replaced by sodium. Anhydrous magnesium\r\nchloride, together with sodium chloride and calcium fluoride, is fused\r\nin a close crucible. The latter substances only serve to facilitate the\r\nformation of a fusible mass before and after the reaction, which is\r\nindispensable in order to prevent the access and action of air. One part\r\nof finely divided sodium to five parts of magnesium chloride is thrown\r\ninto the strongly heated molten mass, and after stirring the reaction\r\nproceeds very quickly, and magnesium separates, MgCl_{2} + Na_{2} = Mg\r\n+ 2NaCl. In working on a large scale, the powdery metallic magnesium\r\nis then subjected to distillation at a white heat. The distillation\r\nof the magnesium is necessary, because the undistilled metal is not\r\nhomogeneous[14] and burns unevenly: the metal is prepared for the\r\npurpose of illumination. Magnesium is a white metal, like silver; it\r\nis not soft like the alkali metals, but is, on the contrary, hard like\r\nthe majority of the ordinary metals. This follows from the fact that it\r\nmelts at a somewhat high temperature--namely, about 500°--and boils at\r\nabout 1000°. It is malleable and ductile, like the generality of metals,\r\nso that it can be drawn into wires and rolled into ribbon; it is most\r\nfrequently used for lighting purposes in the latter form. Unlike the\r\nalkali metals, magnesium does not decompose the atmospheric moisture at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, so that it is almost unacted on by air; it is\r\nnot even acted on by water at the ordinary temperature, so that it may\r\nbe washed to free it from sodium chloride. Magnesium only decomposes\r\nwater with the evolution of hydrogen at the boiling point of water,[15]\r\nand more rapidly at still higher temperatures. This is explained by the\r\nfact that in decomposing water magnesium forms an insoluble hydroxide,\r\nMgH_{2}O_{2}, which covers the metal and hinders the further action\r\nof the water. Magnesium easily displaces hydrogen from acids, forming\r\nmagnesium salts. When ignited it _burns_, not only in oxygen but in air\r\n(and even in carbonic anhydride), forming a white powder of magnesium\r\noxide, or magnesia; in burning it emits a white and exceedingly\r\n_brilliant light_. The strength of this light naturally depends on the\r\nfact that magnesium (24 parts by weight) in burning evolves about\r\n140 thousand heat units, and that the product of combustion, MgO,\r\nis infusible by heat; so that the vapour of the burning magnesium\r\ncontains an ignited powder of non-volatile and infusible magnesia,\r\nand consequently presents all the conditions for the production of\r\na brilliant light. The light emitted by burning magnesium contains\r\nmany rays which act chemically, and are situated in the violet and\r\nultra-violet parts of the spectrum. For this reason burning magnesium\r\nmay be employed for producing photographic images.[16]\r\n\r\n  [13] Sodium and potassium only decompose magnesium oxide at a white\r\n       heat and very feebly, probably for two reasons. In the first\r\n       place, because the reaction Mg + O develops more heat (about 140\r\n       thousand calories) than K_{2} + O or Na_{2} + O (about 100\r\n       thousand calories); and, in the second place, because magnesia is\r\n       not fusible at the heat of a furnace and cannot act on the\r\n       charcoal, sodium, or potassium--that is, it does not pass into\r\n       that mobile state which is necessary for reaction. The first\r\n       reason alone is not sufficient to explain the absence of the\r\n       reaction between charcoal and magnesia, because iron and charcoal\r\n       in combining with oxygen evolve less heat than sodium or\r\n       potassium, yet, nevertheless, they can displace them. With respect\r\n       to magnesium chloride, it acts on sodium and potassium, not only\r\n       because their combination with chlorine evolves more heat than the\r\n       combination of chlorine and magnesium (Mg + Cl_{2} gives 150 and\r\n       Na_{2} + Cl_{2} about 195 thousand calories), but also because a\r\n       fusion, both of the magnesium chloride and of the double salt,\r\n       takes place under the action of heat. It is probable, however,\r\n       that a reverse reaction will take place. A reverse reaction might\r\n       probably be expected, and Winkler (1890) showed that Mg reduces\r\n       the oxides of the alkali metals (Chapter XIII., Note 42).\r\n\r\n  [14] Commercial magnesium generally contains a certain amount of\r\n       magnesium nitride (Deville and Caron), Mg_{3}N_{2}--that is, a\r\n       product of substitution of ammonia which is directly formed (as is\r\n       easily shown by experiment) when magnesium is heated in nitrogen.\r\n       It is a yellowish green powder, which gives ammonia and magnesia\r\n       with water, and cyanogen when heated with carbonic anhydride.\r\n       Pashkoffsky (1893) showed that Mg_{3}N_{2} is easily formed and is\r\n       the sole product when Mg is heated to redness in a current of\r\n       NH_{3}. Perfectly pure magnesium may be obtained by the action of\r\n       a galvanic current.\r\n\r\n  [15] Hydrogen peroxide (Weltzien) dissolves magnesium. The reaction has\r\n       not been investigated.\r\n\r\n  [16] A special form of apparatus is used for burning magnesium. It is a\r\n       clockwork arrangement in which a cylinder rotates, round which a\r\n       ribbon or wire of magnesium is wound. The wire is subjected to a\r\n       uniform unwinding and burning as the cylinder rotates, and in this\r\n       manner the combustion may continue uniform for a certain time. The\r\n       same is attained in special lamps, by causing a mixture of sand\r\n       and finely divided magnesium to fall from a funnel-shaped\r\n       reservoir on to the flame. In photography it is best to blow\r\n       finely divided magnesium into a colourless (spirit or gas) flame,\r\n       and for instantaneous photography to light a cartridge of a\r\n       mixture of magnesium and chlorate of potassium by means of a spark\r\n       from a Ruhmkorff's coil (D. Mendeléeff, 1889).\r\n\r\nOwing to its great affinity for oxygen, magnesium _reduces_ many metals\r\n(zinc, iron, bismuth, antimony, cadmium, tin, lead, copper, silver, and\r\nothers) from solutions of their salts at the ordinary temperature,[17]\r\nand at a red heat finely divided magnesium takes up the oxygen from\r\nsilica, alumina, boric anhydride, &c.; so that silicon and similar\r\nelements may be obtained by directly heating a mixture of powdered silica\r\nand magnesium in an infusible glass tube.[18]\r\n\r\n  [17] According to the observations of Maack, Comaille, Böttger, and\r\n       others. The reduction by heat mentioned further on was pointed out\r\n       by Geuther, Phipson, Parkinson and Gattermann.\r\n\r\n  [18] This action of metallic magnesium in all probability depends,\r\n       although only partially (_see_ Note 13), on its volatility, and on\r\n       the fact that, in combining with a given quantity of oxygen, it\r\n       evolves more heat than aluminium, silicon, potassium, and other\r\n       elements.\r\n\r\nThe affinity of magnesium for the halogens is much more feeble than for\r\noxygen,[19] as is at once evident from the fact that a solution of iodine\r\nacts feebly on magnesium; still magnesium burns in the vapours of iodine,\r\nbromine, and chlorine. The character of magnesium is also seen in the\r\nfact that all its salts, especially in the presence of water, are\r\ndecomposable at a comparatively moderate temperature, the elements of the\r\nacid being evolved, and the magnesium oxide, which is non-volatile and\r\nunchangeable by heat, being left. This naturally refers to those acids\r\nwhich are themselves volatilised by heat. Even magnesium sulphate is\r\ncompletely decomposed at the temperature at which iron melts, oxide of\r\nmagnesium remaining behind. This decomposition of magnesium salts by heat\r\nproceeds much more easily than that of calcium salts. For example,\r\nmagnesium carbonate is totally decomposed at 170°, magnesium oxide being\r\nleft behind. This _magnesia_, or _magnesium oxide_, is met with both in\r\nan anhydrous and hydrated state in nature (the anhydrous magnesia as the\r\nmineral _periclase_, MgO, and the hydrated magnesia as _brucite_,\r\nMgH_{2}O_{2}). Magnesia is a well-known medicine (calcined\r\nmagnesia--_magnesia usta_). It is a white, extremely fine, and very\r\nvoluminous powder, of specific gravity 3·4; it is infusible by heat, and\r\nonly shrinks or shrivels in an oxyhydrogen flame. After long contact the\r\nanhydrous magnesia combines with water, although very slowly, forming the\r\nhydroxide Mg(HO)_{2}, which, however, parts with its water with great\r\nease when heated even below a red heat, and again yields anhydrous\r\nmagnesia. This hydroxide is obtained directly as a gelatinous amorphous\r\nsubstance when a soluble alkali is mixed with a solution of any magnesium\r\nsalt, MgCl_{2} + 2KHO = Mg(HO)_{2} + 2KCl. This decomposition is\r\ncomplete, and nearly all the magnesium passes into the precipitate; and\r\nthis clearly shows the almost perfect insolubility of magnesia in water.\r\nWater dissolves a scarcely perceptible quantity of magnesium\r\nhydroxide--namely, one part is dissolved by 55,000 parts of water. Such a\r\nsolution, however, has an alkaline reaction, and gives, with a salt of\r\nphosphoric acid, a precipitate of magnesium phosphate, which is still\r\nmore insoluble. Magnesia is not only dissolved by acids, forming salts,\r\nbut it also displaces certain other bases--for example, ammonia from\r\nammonium salts when boiled; and the hydroxide also absorbs carbonic\r\nanhydride from the air. The magnesium salts, like those of calcium,\r\npotassium, and sodium, are colourless if they are formed from colourless\r\nacids. Those which are soluble have a bitter taste, whence magnesia has\r\nbeen termed _bitter-earth_. In comparison with the alkalis magnesia is a\r\nfeeble base, inasmuch as it forms somewhat unstable salts, easily gives\r\nbasic salts, forms acid salts with difficulty, and is able to give double\r\nsalts with the salts of the alkalis, which facts are characteristic of\r\nfeeble bases, as we shall see in becoming acquainted with the different\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\n  [19] Davy, on heating magnesia in chlorine, concluded that there was a\r\n       complete substitution, because the volume of the oxygen was half\r\n       the volume of the chlorine; it is probable, however, that owing to\r\n       the formation of chlorine oxide (Chapter XI., Note 30) the\r\n       decomposition is not complete and is limited by a reverse\r\n       reaction.\r\n\r\nThe power of magnesium salts to form double and basic salts is very\r\nfrequently shown in reactions, and is specially marked as\r\nregards ammonium salts. If saturated solutions of magnesium and\r\nammonium sulphates are mixed together, a crystalline double salt\r\nMg(NH_{4})_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},6H_{2}O,[20] is immediately precipitated.\r\nA strong solution of ordinary ammonium carbonate dissolves magnesium\r\noxide or carbonate, and precipitates crystals of a double salt,\r\nMg(NH_{4})_{2}(CO_{3})_{2},4H_{2}O, from which water extracts the\r\nammonium carbonate. With an excess of an ammonium salt the double\r\nsalt passes into solution,[21] and therefore if a solution contain\r\na magnesium salt and an excess of an ammonium salt--for instance,\r\nsal-ammoniac--then sodium carbonate will no longer precipitate\r\nmagnesium carbonate. A mixture of solutions of magnesium and ammonium\r\nchlorides, on evaporation or refrigeration, gives a double salt,\r\nMg(NH_{4})Cl_{3},6H_{2}O.[22] The salts of potassium, like those\r\nof ammonium, are able to enter into combination with the magnesium\r\nsalts.[23] For instance, the double salt, MgKCl_{3},6H_{2}O, which is\r\nknown as _carnallite_,[24] and occurs in the salt mines of Stassfurt,\r\nmay be formed by freezing a saturated solution of potassium chloride\r\nwith an excess of magnesium chloride. A saturated solution of magnesium\r\nsulphate dissolves potassium sulphate, and solid magnesium sulphate\r\nis soluble in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate. A double\r\nsalt, K_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},6H_{2}_O, which closely resembles the\r\nabove-mentioned ammonium salt, crystallises from these solutions.[25]\r\nThe nearest analogues of magnesium are able to give exactly similar\r\ndouble salts, both in crystalline form (monoclinic system) and\r\ncomposition; they, like this salt (_see_ Chapter XV.), are easily\r\nable (at 140°) to part with all their water of crystallisation,\r\nand correspond with the salts of sulphuric acid, whose type may\r\nbe taken as _magnesium sulphate_, MgSO_{4}.[26] It occurs at\r\nStassfurt as _kieserite_, MgSO_{4},H_{2}O, and generally separates\r\nfrom solutions as a heptahydrated salt, MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O, and from\r\nsupersaturated solutions as a hexahydrated salt, MgSO_{4},6H_{2}O; at\r\ntemperatures below 0° it crystallises out as a dodecahydrated salt,\r\nMgSO_{4},12H_{2}O, and a solution of the composition MgSO_{4},2H_{2}O\r\nsolidifies completely at -5°.[27] Thus between water and magnesium\r\nsulphate there may exist several definite and more or less stable\r\ndegrees of equilibrium; the double salt MgSO_{4}K_{2}SO_{4},6H_{2}O\r\nmay be regarded as one of these equilibrated systems, the more so\r\nsince it contains 6H_{2}O, whilst MgSO_{4} forms its most stable\r\nsystem with 7H_{2}O, and the double salt may be considered as this\r\ncrystallo-hydrate in which one molecule of water is replaced by the\r\nmolecule K_{2}SO_{4}.[28]\r\n\r\n  [20] Even a solution of ammonium chloride gives this salt with\r\n       magnesium sulphate. Its sp. gr. is 1·72; 100 parts of water at 0°\r\n       dissolve 9, at 20° 17·9 parts of the anhydrous salt. At about 130°\r\n       it loses all its water.\r\n\r\n  [21] This is an example of equilibrium and of the influence of mass;\r\n       the double salt is decomposed by water, but if instead of water we\r\n       take a solution of that soluble part which is formed in the\r\n       decomposition of the double salt, then the latter dissolves as a\r\n       whole.\r\n\r\n  [22] If an excess of ammonia be added to a solution of magnesium\r\n       chloride, only half the magnesium is thrown down in the\r\n       precipitate, 2MgCl_{2} + 2NH_{4}.OH = Mg(OH)_{2} + Mg.NH_{4}Cl_{3}\r\n       + NH_{4}Cl. A solution of ammonium chloride reacts with magnesia,\r\n       evolving ammonia and forming a solution of the same salt, MgO +\r\n       3NH_{4}Cl = MgNH_{4}Cl_{3} + H_{2}O + 2NH_{3}.\r\n\r\n       Among the double salts of ammonium and magnesium, the phosphate,\r\n       MgNH_{4}PO_{4},6H_{2}O, is almost insoluble in water (0·07 gram is\r\n       soluble in a litre), even in the presence of ammonia. Magnesia is\r\n       very frequently precipitated as this salt from solutions in which\r\n       it is held by ammonium salts. As lime is not retained in solution\r\n       by the presence of ammonium salts, but is precipitated\r\n       nevertheless by sodium carbonate, &c., it is very easy to separate\r\n       calcium from magnesium by taking advantage of these properties.\r\n\r\n  [23] In order to see the nature and cause of formation of double salts,\r\n       it is sufficient (although this does not embrace the whole essence\r\n       of the matter) to consider that one of the metals of such salts\r\n       (for instance, potassium) easily gives acid salts, and the other\r\n       (in this instance, magnesium) basic salts; the properties of\r\n       distinctly basic elements predominate in the former, whilst in the\r\n       latter these properties are enfeebled, and the salts formed by\r\n       them bear the character of acids--for example, the salts of\r\n       aluminium or magnesium act in many cases like acids. By their\r\n       mutual combination these two opposite properties of the salts are\r\n       both satisfied.\r\n\r\n  [24] Carnallite has been mentioned in Chapter X. (Note 4) and in\r\n       Chapter XIII. These deposits also contain much _kainite_,\r\n       KMgCl(SO_{4}),3H_{2}O (sp. gr. 2·13; 100 parts of water dissolve\r\n       79·6 parts at 18°). This double salt contains two metals and two\r\n       haloids. Feit (1889) also obtained a bromide corresponding to\r\n       carnallite.\r\n\r\n  [25] The component parts of certain double salts diffuse at different\r\n       rates, and as the diffused solution contains a different\r\n       proportion of the component salts than the solution taken of the\r\n       double salt, it shows that such salts are decomposed by water.\r\n       According to Rüdorff, the double salts, like carnallite,\r\n       MgK_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},6H_{2}O, and the alums, all belong to this\r\n       order (1888). But such salts as tartar emetic, the double\r\n       oxalates, and double cyanides are not separated by diffusion,\r\n       which in all probability depends both on the relative rate of the\r\n       diffusion of the component salts and on the degree of affinity\r\n       acting between them. Those complex states of equilibrium which\r\n       exist between water, the individual salts MX and NY, and the\r\n       double salt MNXY, have been already partially analysed (as will be\r\n       shown hereafter) in that case when the system is heterogeneous\r\n       (that is, when something separates out in a solid state from the\r\n       liquid solution), but in the case of equilibria in a homogeneous\r\n       liquid medium (in a solution) the phenomenon is not so clear,\r\n       because it concerns that very theory of solution which cannot yet\r\n       be considered as established (Chapter I., Note 9, and others). As\r\n       regards the heterogeneous decomposition of double salts, it has\r\n       long been known that such salts as carnallite and\r\n       K_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2} give up the more soluble salt if an\r\n       insufficient quantity of water for their complete solution be\r\n       taken. The complete saturation of 100 parts of water requires at\r\n       0° 14·1, at 20° 25, and at 60° 50·2 parts of the latter double\r\n       salt (anhydrous), while 100 parts of water dissolve 27 parts of\r\n       magnesium sulphate at 0°, 36 parts at 20°, and 55 parts at 60°, of\r\n       the anhydrous salt taken. Of all the states of equilibrium\r\n       exhibited by double salts the most fully investigated as yet is\r\n       the system containing water, sodium sulphate, magnesium sulphate,\r\n       and their double salt, Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2}, which crystallises\r\n       with 4 and 6 mol. OH_{2}. The first crystallo-hydrate,\r\n       MgNa_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O, occurs at Stassfurt, and as a\r\n       sedimentary deposit in many of the salt lakes near Astrakhan, and\r\n       is therefore called _astrakhanite_. The specific gravity of the\r\n       monoclinic prisms of this salt is 2·22. If this salt, in a finely\r\n       divided state, be mixed with the necessary quantity of water\r\n       (according to the equation MgNa_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O + 13H_{2}O\r\n       = Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O + MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O), the mixture\r\n       solidifies like plaster of Paris into a homogeneous mass if the\r\n       temperature be _below_ 22° (Van't Hoff und Van Deventer, 1886;\r\n       Bakhuis Roozeboom, 1887); but if the temperature be above this\r\n       _transition-point_ the water and double salt do not react on each\r\n       other: that is, they do not solidify or give a mixture of sodium\r\n       and magnesium sulphates. If a mixture (in equivalent quantities)\r\n       of solutions of these salts be evaporated, and crystals of\r\n       astrakhanite and of the individual salts capable of proceeding\r\n       from it be added to the concentrated solution to avoid the\r\n       possibility of a supersaturated solution, then at temperatures\r\n       above 22° astrakhanite is exclusively formed (this is the method\r\n       of its production), but at lower temperatures the individual salts\r\n       are alone produced. If equivalent amounts of Glauber's salt and\r\n       magnesium sulphate be mixed together in a solid state, there is no\r\n       change at temperatures below 22°, but at higher temperatures\r\n       astrakhanite and water are formed. The volume occupied by\r\n       Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O in grams = 322/1·46 = 220·5 cubic\r\n       centimetres, and by MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O = 246/1·68 = 146·4 c.c.;\r\n       hence their mixture in equivalent quantities occupies a volume of\r\n       366·9 c.c. The volume of astrakhanite = 334/2·22 = 150·5 c.c., and\r\n       the volume of 13H_{2}O = 234 c.c., hence their sum = 380·5 c.c.,\r\n       and therefore it is easy to follow the formation of the\r\n       astrakhanite in a suitable apparatus (a kind of thermometer\r\n       containing oil and a powdered mixture of sodium and magnesium\r\n       sulphates), and to see by the variation in volume that below 22°\r\n       it remains unchanged, and at higher temperatures proceeds the more\r\n       quickly the higher the temperature. At the transition temperature\r\n       the solubility of astrakhanite and of the mixture of the component\r\n       salts is one and the same, whilst at higher temperatures a\r\n       solution which is saturated for a mixture of the individual salts\r\n       would be supersaturated for astrakhanite, and at lower\r\n       temperatures the solution of astrakhanite will be supersaturated\r\n       for the component salts, as has been shown with especial detail by\r\n       Karsten, Deacon, and others. Roozeboom showed that there are two\r\n       limits to the composition of the solutions which can exist for a\r\n       double salt; these limits are respectively obtained by dissolving\r\n       a mixture of the double salt with each of its component simple\r\n       salts. Van't Hoff demonstrated, besides this, that the tendency\r\n       towards the formation of double salts has a distinct influence on\r\n       the progress of double decomposition, for at temperatures above\r\n       31° the mixture 2MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O + 2NaCl passes into\r\n       MgNa_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O + MgCl_{2},6H_{2}O + 4H_{2}O, whilst\r\n       below 31° there is not this double decomposition, but it proceeds\r\n       in the opposite direction, as may be demonstrated by the\r\n       above-described methods. Van der Heyd obtained a potassium\r\n       astrakhanite, K_{2}SO_{4}MgSO_{4},4H_{2}O, from solutions of the\r\n       component salts at 100°.\r\n\r\n       From these experiments on double salts we see that there is as\r\n       close a dependence between the temperature and the formation of\r\n       substances as there is between the temperature and a change of\r\n       state. It is a case of Deville's principles of dissociation,\r\n       extended in the direction of the passage of a solid into a liquid.\r\n       On the other hand, we see here how essential a _rôle_ water plays\r\n       in the formation of compounds, and how the affinity for water of\r\n       crystallisation is essentially analogous to the affinity between\r\n       salts, and hence also to the affinity of acids for bases, because\r\n       the formation of double salts does not differ in any essential\r\n       point (except the degree of affinity--that is, from a quantitative\r\n       aspect) from the formation of salts themselves. When sodium\r\n       hydroxide with nitric acid gives sodium nitrate and water the\r\n       phenomenon is essentially the same as in the formation of\r\n       astrakhanite from the salts Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O and\r\n       MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O. Water is disengaged in both cases, and hence the\r\n       volumes are altered.\r\n\r\n  [26] This salt, and especially its crystallo-hydrate with 7H_{2}O, is\r\n       generally known as Epsom salts. It has long been used as a\r\n       purgative. It is easily obtained from magnesia and sulphuric acid,\r\n       and it separates on the evaporation of sea water and of many\r\n       saline springs. When carbonic anhydride is obtained by the action\r\n       of sulphuric acid on magnesite, magnesium sulphate remains in\r\n       solution. When dolomite--that is, a mixture of magnesium and\r\n       calcium carbonates--is subjected to the action of a solution of\r\n       hydrochloric acid until about half of the salt remains, the\r\n       calcium carbonate is mostly dissolved and magnesium carbonate is\r\n       left, which by treatment with sulphuric acid gives a solution of\r\n       magnesium sulphate.\r\n\r\n  [27] The anhydrous salt, MgSO_{4} (sp. gr. 2·61), attracts moisture\r\n       (7 mol. H_{2}O) from moist air; when heated in steam or hydrogen\r\n       chloride it gives sulphuric acid, and when heated with carbon it\r\n       is decomposed according to the equation 2MgSO_{4} + C = 2SO_{2} +\r\n       CO_{2} + 2MgO. The monohydrated salt (kieserite), MgSO_{4},H_{2}O\r\n       (sp. gr. 2·56), dissolves in water with difficulty; it is formed\r\n       by heating the other crystallo-hydrates to 135°. The hexahydrated\r\n       salt is dimorphous. If a solution, saturated at the boiling-point,\r\n       be prepared, and cooled without access of crystals of the\r\n       heptahydrated salt, then MgSO_{4},6H_{2}O crystallises out in\r\n       _monoclinic_ prisms (Loewel, Marignac), which are quite as\r\n       unstable as the salt, Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O; but if prismatic\r\n       crystals of the cubic system of the copper-nickel salts of the\r\n       composition MSO_{4},6H_{2}O be added, then crystals of\r\n       MgSO_{4},6H_{2}O are deposited on them as prisms of the _cubic_\r\n       system (Lecoq de Boisbaudran). The common crystallo-hydrate,\r\n       MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O, Epsom salts, belongs to the _rhombic_ system,\r\n       and is obtained by crystallisation below 30°. Its specific gravity\r\n       is 1·69. In a vacuum, or at 100°, it loses 5H_{2}O, at 132°\r\n       6H_{2}O, and at 210° all the 7H_{2}O (Graham). If crystals of\r\n       ferrous or cobaltic sulphate be placed in a saturated solution,\r\n       _hexagonal_ crystals of the heptahydrated salt are formed (Lecoq\r\n       de Boisbaudran); they present an unstable state of equilibrium,\r\n       and soon become cloudy, probably owing to their transformation\r\n       into the more stable common form. Fritzsche, by cooling saturated\r\n       solutions below 0°, obtained a mixture of crystals of ice and of a\r\n       dodecahydrated salt, which easily split up at temperatures above\r\n       0°. Guthrie showed that dilute solutions of magnesium sulphate,\r\n       when refrigerated, separate ice until the solution attains a\r\n       composition MgSO_{4},24H_{2}O, which will completely freeze into a\r\n       crystallo-hydrate at -5·3°. According to Coppet and Rüdorff, the\r\n       temperature of the formation of ice falls by 0·073° for every part\r\n       by weight of the heptahydrated salt per 100 of water. This figure\r\n       gives (Chapter I., Note 49) _i_ = 1 for both the heptahydrated and\r\n       the anhydrous salt, from which it is evident that it is impossible\r\n       to judge the state of combination in which a dissolved substance\r\n       occurs by the temperature of the formation of ice.\r\n\r\n       The solubility of the different crystallo-hydrates of magnesium\r\n       sulphate, according to Loewel, also varies, like those of sodium\r\n       sulphate or carbonate (_see_ Chapter XII., Notes 7 and 18). At 0°\r\n       100 parts of water dissolves 40·75 MgSO_{4} in the presence of the\r\n       hexahydrated salt, 34·67 MgSO_{4} in the presence of the hexagonal\r\n       heptahydrated salt, and only 26 parts of MgSO_{4} in the presence\r\n       of the ordinary heptahydrated salt--that is, solutions giving the\r\n       remaining crystallo-hydrates will be supersaturated for the\r\n       ordinary heptahydrated salt.\r\n\r\n       All this shows how many diverse aspects of more or less stable\r\n       equilibria may exist between water and a substance dissolved in\r\n       it; this has already been enlarged on in Chapter I.\r\n\r\n       Carefully purified magnesium sulphate in its aqueous solution\r\n       gives, according to Stcherbakoff, an alkaline reaction with\r\n       litmus, and an acid reaction with phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\n       The specific gravity of solutions of certain salts of magnesium\r\n       and calcium reduced to 15°/4° (see my work cited, Chapter I., Note\r\n       19), are, if water at 4° = 10,000,\r\n\r\n              MgSO_{4}: _s_ = 9,992 + 99·89_p_ + 0·553_p_^2\r\n              MgCl_{2}: _s_ = 9,992 + 81·31_p_ + 0·372_p_^2\r\n              CaCl_{2}: _s_ = 9,992 + 80·24_p_ + 0·476_p_^2\r\n\r\n  [28] Graham even distinguished the last equivalent of the water of\r\n       crystallisation of the heptahydrated salt as that which is\r\n       replaced by other salts, pointing out that double salts like\r\n       MgK_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},6H_{2}O lose all their water at 135°, whilst\r\n       MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O only parts with 6H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n_The power of forming basic salts_ is a very remarkable peculiarity of\r\nmagnesia and other feeble bases, and especially of those corresponding\r\nwith polyvalent metals. The very powerful bases corresponding with\r\nunivalent metals--like potassium and sodium--do not form basic salts,\r\nand, indeed, are more prone to give acid salts, whilst magnesium easily\r\nand frequently forms basic salts, especially with feeble acids, although\r\nthere are some oxides--as, for example, copper and lead oxides--which\r\nstill more frequently give basic salts. If a cold solution of magnesium\r\nsulphate be mixed with a solution of sodium carbonate there is formed a\r\ngelatinous precipitate of a basic salt, Mg(HO)_{2},4MgCO_{3},9H_{2}O;\r\nbut all the magnesia is not precipitated in this case, as a portion of it\r\nremains in solution as an acid double salt. If sodium carbonate be added\r\nto a boiling solution of magnesium sulphate a precipitate of a still more\r\nbasic salt is formed, 4MgSO_{4} + 4Na_{2}CO_{3} + 4H_{2}O = 4Na_{2}SO_{4}\r\n+ CO_{2} + Mg(OH)_{2},3MgCO_{3},3H_{2}O. This basic salt forms the\r\nordinary drug _magnesia_ (_magnesia alba_), in the form of light porous\r\nlumps. Other basic salts are formed under certain modifications of\r\ntemperature and conditions of decomposition. But _the normal salt_,\r\nMgCO_{3}, which occurs in nature as magnesite in the form of rhombohedra\r\nof specific gravity 3·056, cannot be obtained by such a method of\r\nprecipitation. In fact, the formation of the different basic salts shows\r\nthe power of water to decompose the normal salt. It is possible, however,\r\nto obtain this salt both in an anhydrous and hydrated state. A solution\r\nof magnesium carbonate in water containing carbonic acid is taken for\r\nthis purpose. The reason for this is easily understood--carbonic\r\nanhydride is one of the products of the decomposition of magnesium\r\ncarbonate in the presence of water. If this solution be left to evaporate\r\nspontaneously the normal salt separates in a hydrated form, but in the\r\nevaporation of a heated solution, through which a stream of carbonic\r\nanhydride is passed, the anhydrous salt is formed as a crystalline mass,\r\nwhich remains unaltered in the air, like the natural mineral.[29] The\r\ndecomposing influence of water on the salts of magnesium, which is\r\ndirectly dependent on the feeble basic properties of magnesia,[30] is\r\nmost clearly seen in _magnesium chloride_, MgCl_{2}. This salt is\r\ncontained[31] in the last mother-liquors of the evaporation of sea-water.\r\nOn cooling a sufficiently concentrated solution, the crystallo-hydrate,\r\nMgCl_{2},6H_{2}O, separates;[32] but if it be further heated (above\r\n106°) to remove the water, then hydrochloric acid passes off together\r\nwith the latter, so that there ultimately remains magnesia with a small\r\nquantity of magnesium chloride.[33] From what has been said it is evident\r\nthat anhydrous magnesium chloride cannot be obtained by simple\r\nevaporation. But if sal-ammoniac or sodium chloride be added to a\r\nsolution of magnesium chloride, then the evolution of hydrochloric acid\r\ndoes not take place, and after complete evaporation the residue is\r\nperfectly soluble in water. This renders it possible to obtain anhydrous\r\nmagnesium chloride from its aqueous solution. Indeed the mixture with\r\nsal-ammoniac (in excess) may be dried (the residue consists of an\r\nanhydrous double salt, MgCl_{2},2NH_{4}Cl) and then ignited (460°), when\r\nthe sal-ammoniac is converted into vapour and a fused mass of anhydrous\r\nmagnesium chloride remains behind. The anhydrous chloride evolves a very\r\nconsiderable amount of heat on the addition of water, which shows the\r\ngreat affinity the salt has for water.[34] Anhydrous magnesium chloride\r\nis not only obtained by the above method, but is also formed by the\r\ndirect combination of chlorine and magnesium, and by the action of\r\nchlorine on magnesium oxide, oxygen being evolved; this proceeds still\r\nmore easily _by heating magnesia with charcoal in a stream of chlorine_,\r\nwhen the charcoal serves to take up the oxygen. This latter method is\r\nalso employed for the preparation of chlorides which are formed in an\r\nanhydrous condition with still greater difficulty than magnesium\r\nchloride. Anhydrous magnesium chloride forms a colourless, transparent\r\nmass, composed of flexible crystalline plates of a pearly lustre. It\r\nfuses at a low red heat (708°) into a colourless liquid, remains\r\nunchanged in a dry state, but under the action of moisture is partially\r\ndecomposed even at the ordinary temperature, with formation of\r\nhydrochloric acid. When heated in the presence of oxygen (air) it gives\r\nchlorine and the basic salt, which is formed with even greater facility\r\nunder the action of heat in the presence of steam, when HCl is formed,\r\naccording to the equation 2MgCl_{2} + H_{2}O = MgOMgCl_{2} + 2HCl.[34 bis]\r\n\r\n  [29] The crystalline form of the anhydrous salt obtained in\r\n       this manner is not the same as that of the natural salt. The\r\n       former gives rhombohedra, like those in which calcium carbonate\r\n       appears as calc spar, whilst the natural salt appears as rhombic\r\n       prisms, like those sometimes presented by the same carbonate as\r\n       aragonite, which will shortly be described.\r\n\r\n  [30] Magnesium sulphate enters into certain reactions which are proper\r\n       to sulphuric acid itself. Thus, for instance, if a carefully\r\n       prepared mixture of equivalent quantities of hydrated magnesium\r\n       sulphate and sodium chloride be heated to redness, the evolution\r\n       of hydrochloric acid is observed just as in the action of\r\n       sulphuric acid on common salt, MgSO_{4} + 2NaCl + H_{2}O =\r\n       Na_{2}SO_{4} + MgO + 2HCl. Magnesium sulphate acts in a similar\r\n       manner on nitrates, with the evolution of nitric acid. A mixture\r\n       of it with common salt and manganese peroxide gives chlorine.\r\n       Sulphuric acid is sometimes replaced by magnesium sulphate in\r\n       galvanic batteries--for example, in the well-known Meidinger\r\n       battery. In the above-mentioned reactions we see a striking\r\n       example of the similarity of the reactions of acids and salts,\r\n       especially of salts which contain such feeble bases as magnesia.\r\n\r\n  [31] As sea-water contains many salts, MCl and MgX_{2}, it follows,\r\n       according to Berthollet's teaching, that MgCl_{2} is also present.\r\n\r\n  [32] As the crystallo-hydrates of the salts of sodium often contain\r\n       10H_{2}O, so many of the salts of magnesium contain 6H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  [33] This decomposition is most simply defined as the result of the\r\n       two reverse reactions, MgCl_{2} ÷ H_{2}O = MgO + 2HCl and MgO +\r\n       2HCl = MgCl_{2} + H_{2}O, or as a distribution between O and\r\n       Cl_{2} on the one hand and H_{2} and Mg on the other. (With O,\r\n       MgCl_{2} gives chlorine, _see_ Chapter X., Note 33, and Chapter\r\n       II., Note 3 bis and others, where the reactions and\r\n       applications of MgCl_{2} are given.) It is then clear that,\r\n       according to Berthollet's doctrine, the mass of the hydrochloric\r\n       acid converts the magnesium oxide into chloride, and the mass of\r\n       the water converts the magnesium chloride into oxide. The\r\n       crystallo-hydrate, MgCl_{2},6H_{2}O, forms the limit of the\r\n       reversibility. But an intermediate state of equilibrium may exist\r\n       in the form of basic salts. On mixing ignited magnesia with a\r\n       solution of magnesium chloride of specific gravity about 1·2, a\r\n       solid mass is obtained which is scarcely decomposed by water at\r\n       the ordinary temperature (_see_ Chapter XVI., Note 4). A similar\r\n       means is employed for cementing sawdust into a solid mass, called\r\n       cylolite, used for flooring, &c.\r\n\r\n       We may remark that MgBr_{2} crystallises not only with 6H_{2}O\r\n       (temperature of fusion 152°), but also with 10H_{2}O (temperature\r\n       of fusion +12°, formed at -18°). (Panfiloff, 1894).\r\n\r\n  [34] According to Thomsen, the combination of MgCl_{2} with 6H_{2}O\r\n       evolves 33,000 calories, and its solution in an excess of water\r\n       36,000.\r\n\r\n  [34 bis] Hence MgCl_{2} may be employed for the preparation of chlorine\r\n       and hydrochloric acid (Chapters X. and XI.). In general magnesium\r\n       chloride, which is obtained in large quantities from sea water and\r\n       Stassfurt carnallite, may find numerous practical uses.\r\n\r\n_Calcium_ (or the metal of lime) and its compounds in many respects\r\npresent a great resemblance to magnesium compounds, but are also clearly\r\ndistinguished from them by many properties.[35] In general, calcium\r\nstands to magnesium in the same relation as potassium occupies in respect\r\nto sodium. Davy obtained metallic calcium, like potassium, as an amalgam\r\nby the action of a galvanic current; but neither charcoal nor iron\r\ndecomposes calcium oxide, and even sodium decomposes calcium chloride[36]\r\nwith difficulty. But a galvanic current easily decomposes calcium\r\nchloride, and metallic sodium somewhat easily decomposes calcium iodide\r\nwhen heated. As in the case of hydrogen, potassium, and magnesium, the\r\naffinity of iodine for calcium is feebler than that of chlorine (and\r\noxygen), and therefore it is not surprising that calcium iodide may be\r\nsubjected to that decomposition, which the chloride and oxide undergo\r\nwith difficulty.[37] _Metallic calcium_ is of a yellow colour, and has a\r\nconsiderable lustre, which it preserves in dry air. Its specific gravity\r\nis 1·58. Calcium is distinguished by its great ductility; it melts at a\r\nred heat and then burns in the air with a very brilliant flame; the\r\nbrilliancy is due to the formation of finely divided infusible calcium\r\noxide. Judging from the fact that calcium in burning gives a very large\r\nflame, it is probable that this metal is volatile. Calcium decomposes\r\nwater at the ordinary temperature, and is oxidised in moist air, but not\r\nso rapidly as sodium. In burning, it gives its oxide or _lime_, CaO, a\r\nsubstance which is familiar to every one, and of which we have already\r\nfrequently had occasion to speak. This oxide is not met with in nature in\r\na free state, because it is an energetic base which everywhere encounters\r\nacid substances forming salts with them. It is generally combined with\r\nsilica, or occurs as calcium carbonate or sulphate. The carbonate and\r\nnitrate are decomposed, at a red heat, with the formation of lime. As a\r\nrule, the carbonate, which is so frequently met with in nature, serves as\r\nthe source of the calcium oxide, both commercial and pure. When heated,\r\ncalcium carbonate dissociates: CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}. In practice the\r\ndecomposition is conducted at a bright red heat, in the presence of\r\nsteam, or a current of a foreign gas, in heaps or in special kilns.[38]\r\n\r\n  [35] There are many other methods of separating calcium from magnesium\r\n       besides that mentioned above (Note 22). Among them it will be\r\n       sufficient to mention the behaviour of these bases towards a\r\n       solution of sugar; hydrated _lime_ is exceedingly _soluble in an\r\n       aqueous solution of sugar_, whilst magnesia is but little soluble.\r\n       All the lime may be extracted from dolomite by burning it, slaking\r\n       the mixture of oxides thus obtained, and adding a 10 p.c. solution\r\n       of sugar. Carbonic anhydride precipitates calcium carbonate from\r\n       this solution. The addition of sugar (molasses) to the lime used\r\n       for building purposes powerfully increases the binding power of\r\n       the mortar, as I have myself found. I have been told that in the\r\n       East (India, Japan) the addition of sugar to cement has long been\r\n       practised.\r\n\r\n  [36] Moreover Caron obtained an alloy of calcium and zinc by fusing\r\n       calcium chloride with zinc and sodium. The zinc distilled from\r\n       this alloy at a white heat, leaving calcium behind (Note 50).\r\n\r\n  [37] Calcium iodide may be prepared by saturating lime with hydriodic\r\n       acid. It is a very soluble salt (at 20° one part of the salt\r\n       requires 0·49 part and at 43° 0·35 part of water for solution), is\r\n       deliquescent in the air, and resembles calcium chloride in many\r\n       respects. It changes but little when evaporated, and like calcium\r\n       chloride fuses when heated, and therefore all the water may be\r\n       driven off by heat. If anhydrous calcium iodide be heated with an\r\n       equivalent quantity of sodium in a closely covered iron crucible,\r\n       sodium iodide and metallic calcium are formed (Liés-Bodart). Dumas\r\n       advises carrying on this reaction in a closed space under\r\n       pressure.\r\n\r\n  [38] Kilns which act either intermittently or continuously are built\r\n       for this purpose. Those of the first kind are filled with\r\n       alternate layers of fuel and limestone; the fuel is lighted, and\r\n       the heat developed by its combustion serves for decomposing the\r\n       limestone. When the process is completed the kiln is allowed to\r\n       cool somewhat, the lime raked out, and the same process repeated.\r\n       In the continuously acting furnaces, constructed like that shown\r\n       in fig. 78, the kiln itself only contains limestone, and there are\r\n       lateral hearths for burning the fuel, whose flame passes through\r\n       the limestone and serves for its decomposition. Such furnaces are\r\n       able to work continuously, because the unburnt limestone may be\r\n       charged from above and the burnt lime raked out from below. It is\r\n       not every limestone that is suitable for the preparation of lime,\r\n       because many contain impurities, principally clay, dolomite, and\r\n       sand. Such limestones when burnt either fuse partially or give an\r\n       impure lime, called _poor_ lime in distinction from that obtained\r\n       from purer limestone, which is called _rich_ lime. The latter kind\r\n       is characterised by its disintegrating into a fine powder when\r\n       treated with water, and is suitable for the majority of uses to\r\n       which lime is applied, and for which the poor lime is sometimes\r\n       quite unfit. However, certain kinds of poor lime (as we shall see\r\n       in Chapter XVIII., Note 25) are used in the preparation of\r\n       hydraulic cements, which solidify into a hard mass under water.\r\n\r\n       In order to obtain perfectly pure lime it is necessary to take the\r\n       purest possible materials. In the laboratory, marble or shells are\r\n       used for this purpose as a pure form of calcium carbonate. They\r\n       are first burnt in a furnace, then put in a crucible and moistened\r\n       with a small quantity of water, and finally strongly ignited, by\r\n       which means a pure lime is obtained. Pure lime may be more rapidly\r\n       prepared by taking calcium nitrate, CaN_{2}O_{6}, which is easily\r\n       obtained by dissolving limestone in nitric acid. The solution\r\n       obtained is boiled with a small quantity of lime in order to\r\n       precipitate the foreign oxides which are insoluble in water. The\r\n       oxides of iron, aluminium, &c., are precipitated by this means.\r\n       The salt is then crystallised and ignited: CaN_{2}O_{6} = CaO +\r\n       2NO_{2} + O.\r\n\r\n       In the decomposition of calcium carbonate the lime preserves the\r\n       form of the lumps subjected to ignition; this is one of the signs\r\n       distinguishing quicklime when it is freshly burnt and unaltered by\r\n       air. It attracts moisture from the air and then disintegrates to a\r\n       powder; if left long exposed in the air, it also attracts carbonic\r\n       anhydride and increases in volume; it does not entirely pass into\r\n       carbonate, but forms a compound of the latter with caustic lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Continually-acting kiln for burning lime. The\r\nlime is charged from above and calcined by four lateral grates, R, M. D,\r\nfire-bars. B, space for withdrawing the burnt lime. K, stoke-house. M.\r\nfire grate. Q, R, under-grate.]\r\n\r\nCalcium oxide--that is, quicklime--is a substance (sp. gr. 3·15) which\r\nis unaffected by heat,[39] and may therefore serve as a fire-resisting\r\nmaterial, and was employed by Deville for the construction of furnaces in\r\nwhich platinum was melted, and silver volatilised by the action of the\r\nheat evolved by the combustion of detonating gas. The hydrated lime,\r\nslaked lime, or calcium hydroxide, CaH_{2}O_{2} (specific gravity 2·07)\r\nis a most common alkaline substance, employed largely in building for\r\nmaking mortars or cements, in which case its binding property is mainly\r\ndue to the absorption of carbonic anhydride.[40] Lime, like other\r\nalkalis, acts on many animal and vegetable substances, and for this\r\nreason has many practical uses--for example, for removing fats, and in\r\nagriculture for accelerating the decomposition of organic substances in\r\nthe so-called _composts_ or accumulations of vegetable and animal remains\r\nused for fertilising land. Calcium hydroxide easily loses its water at a\r\nmoderate heat (530°), but it does not part with water at 100°. When mixed\r\nwith water, lime forms a pasty mass known as _slaked lime_ and in a more\r\ndilute form as _milk of lime_, because when shaken up in water it remains\r\nsuspended in it for a long time and presents the appearance of a milky\r\nliquid. But, besides this, lime is directly soluble in water, not to any\r\nconsiderable extent, but still in such a quantity that _lime water_ is\r\nprecipitated by carbonic anhydride, and has clearly distinguishable\r\nalkaline properties. One part of lime requires at the ordinary\r\ntemperature about 800 parts of water for solution. At 100° it requires\r\nabout 1500 parts of water, and therefore lime-water becomes cloudy when\r\nboiled. If lime-water be evaporated in a vacuum, calcium hydroxide\r\nseparates in six-sided crystals.[41] If lime-water be mixed with hydrogen\r\nperoxide minute crystals of _calcium peroxide_, CaO_{2},8H_{2}O,\r\nseparate; this compound is very unstable and, like barium peroxide, is\r\ndecomposed by heat. Lime, as a powerful base, combines with all acids,\r\nand in this respect presents a transition from the true alkalis to\r\nmagnesia. Many of the salts of calcium (the carbonate, phosphate,\r\nborate, and oxalate) are insoluble in water; besides which the sulphate\r\nis only sparingly soluble. As a more energetic base than magnesia, lime\r\nforms salts, CaX_{2}, which are distinguished by their stability in\r\ncomparison with the salts MgX_{2}; neither does lime so easily form basic\r\nand double salts as magnesia.\r\n\r\n  [39] Lime, when raised to a white heat in the vapour of potassium,\r\n       gives calcium, and in chlorine it gives off oxygen. Sulphur,\r\n       phosphorus, &c., when heated with lime, are absorbed by it.\r\n\r\n  [40] The greater quantity of lime is used in making mortar for binding\r\n       bricks or stones together, in the form of _lime_ or _cement_, or\r\n       the so-called _slaked lime_. For this purpose the lime is mixed\r\n       with water and sand, which serves to separate the particles of\r\n       lime from each other. If only lime paste were put between two\r\n       bricks they would not hold firmly together, because after the\r\n       water had evaporated the lime would occupy a smaller space than\r\n       before, and therefore cracks and powder would form in its mass, so\r\n       that it would not at all produce that complete cementation of the\r\n       bricks which it is desired to attain. Pieces of stone--that is,\r\n       sand--mixed with the lime hinder this process of disintegration,\r\n       because the lime binds together the individual grains of sand\r\n       mixed with it, and forms one concrete mass, in consequence of a\r\n       process which proceeds after the desiccation or removal of the\r\n       water. The process of the solidification of lime, taken as slaked\r\n       lime, consists first in the direct evaporation of the water and\r\n       crystallisation of the hydrate, so that the lime binds the stones\r\n       and sand mixed with it, just as glue binds two pieces of wood. But\r\n       this preliminary binding action of lime is feeble (as is seen by\r\n       direct experiment) unless there be further alteration of the lime\r\n       leading to the formation of carbonates, silicates, and other salts\r\n       of calcium which are distinguished by their great cohesiveness.\r\n       With the progress of time the cement is partially subjected to the\r\n       action of the carbonic anhydride in the air, owing to which\r\n       calcium carbonate is formed, but not more than half the lime is\r\n       thus converted into carbonate. Besides which, the lime partially\r\n       acts on the silica of the bricks, and it is owing to these new\r\n       combinations simultaneously forming in the cement that it\r\n       gradually becomes stronger and stronger. Hence the binding action\r\n       of the lime becomes stronger with the lapse of time. This is the\r\n       reason (and not, as is sometimes said, because the ancients knew\r\n       how to build stronger than we do) why buildings which have stood\r\n       for centuries possess a very strongly binding cement. Hydraulic\r\n       cements will be described later (Chapter XVIII., Note 25).\r\n\r\n  [41] Professor Glinka measured the transparent bright crystals of\r\n       calcium hydroxide which are formed in common hydraulic (Portland)\r\n       cement.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous lime does not absorb dry carbonic anhydride at the ordinary\r\ntemperature. This was already known by Scheele, and Prof. Schuliachenko\r\nshowed that there is no absorption even at 360°. It only proceeds at a\r\nred heat,[42] and then only leads to the formation of a mixture of\r\ncalcium oxide and carbonate (Rose). But if the lime be slaked or\r\ndissolved, the absorption of carbonic anhydride proceeds rapidly and\r\ncompletely. These phenomena are connected with the _dissociation of\r\ncalcium carbonate_, studied by Debray (1867) under the influence of the\r\nconceptions of dissociation introduced into science by Henri Saint-Claire\r\nDeville. Just as there is no vapour tension for non-volatile substances,\r\nso there is no dissociation tension of carbonic anhydride for calcium\r\ncarbonate at the ordinary temperature. Just as every volatile substance\r\nhas a maximum possible vapour tension for every temperature, so also\r\ncalcium carbonate has its corresponding _dissociation tension_; this at\r\n770° (the boiling point of cadmium) is about 85 mm. (of the mercury\r\ncolumn), and at 930° (the boiling point of Zn) it is about 520 mm. As, if\r\nthe tension be greater, there will be no evaporation, so also there will\r\nhe no decomposition. Debray took crystals of calc spar, and could not\r\nobserve the least change in them at the boiling point of zinc (930°) in\r\nan atmosphere of carbonic anhydride taken at the atmospheric pressure\r\n(760 mm.), whilst on the other hand calcium carbonate may be completely\r\ndecomposed at a much lower temperature if the tension of the carbonic\r\nanhydride be kept below the dissociation tension, which may be done\r\neither by directly pumping away the gas with an air-pump, or by mixing it\r\nwith some other gas--that is, by diminishing the partial pressure of the\r\ncarbonic anhydride,[43] just as an object may be dried at the ordinary\r\ntemperature by removing the aqueous vapour or by carrying it off in a\r\nstream of another gas. Thus it is possible to obtain calcium carbonate\r\nfrom lime and carbonic anhydride at a certain temperature above that at\r\nwhich dissociation begins, and conversely to decompose calcium carbonate\r\nat the same temperature into lime and carbonic anhydride.[44] At the\r\nordinary temperature the reaction of the first order (combination) cannot\r\nproceed because the second (decomposition, dissociation) cannot take\r\nplace, and thus all the most important phenomena with respect to the\r\nbehaviour of lime towards carbonic anhydride are explained by starting\r\nfrom one common basis.[45]\r\n\r\n  [42] The act of heating brings the substance into that state of\r\n       internal motion which is required for reaction. It should be\r\n       considered that by the act of heating not only is the bond between\r\n       the parts, or cohesion of the molecules, altered (generally\r\n       diminished), not only is the motion or store of energy of the\r\n       whole molecule increased, but also that in all probability the\r\n       motion of the atoms themselves in molecules undergoes a change.\r\n       The same kind of change is accomplished by the act of solution, or\r\n       of combination in general, judging from the fact that a dissolved\r\n       or combined substance--for instance, lime with water--reacts on\r\n       carbonic anhydride as it does under the action of heat. For the\r\n       comprehension of chemical phenomena it is exceedingly useful to\r\n       recognise clearly this parallelism. Rose's observation on the\r\n       formation (by the slow diffusion of solutions of calcium chloride\r\n       and sodium carbonate) of aragonite from dilute, and of calc spar\r\n       from strong, solutions is easily understood from this point of\r\n       view. As aragonite is always formed from hot solutions, it appears\r\n       that dilution with water acts like heat. The following experiment\r\n       of Kühlmann is particularly instructive in this sense. Anhydrous\r\n       (perfectly dry) barium oxide does not react with monohydrated\r\n       sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4} (containing neither free water nor\r\n       anhydride, SO_{3}). But if either an incandescent object or a\r\n       moist substance is brought into contact with the mixture a violent\r\n       reaction immediately begins (it is essentially the same as\r\n       combustion), and the whole mass reacts.\r\n\r\n       The influence of solution on the process of reaction is\r\n       instructively illustrated by the following experiment. Lime, or\r\n       barium oxide, is placed in a flask or retort having an upper\r\n       orifice and connected with a tube immersed in mercury. A funnel\r\n       furnished with a stopcock and filled with water is fixed into the\r\n       upper orifice of the retort, which is then filled with dry\r\n       carbonic anhydride. There is no absorption. When a constant\r\n       temperature is arrived at, the unslaked oxide is made to absorb\r\n       all the carbonic anhydride by carefully admitting water. A vacuum\r\n       is formed, as is seen by the mercury rising in the neck of the\r\n       retort. With water the absorption goes on to the end, whilst under\r\n       the action of heat there remains the dissociating tension of the\r\n       carbonic anhydride. Furthermore, we here see that, with a certain\r\n       resemblance, there is also a distinction, depending on the fact\r\n       that at low temperatures calcium carbonate does not dissociate;\r\n       this determines the complete absorption of the carbonic anhydride\r\n       in the aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n  [43] Experience has shown that by moistening partially-burnt lime with\r\n       water and reheating it, it is easy to drive off the last traces of\r\n       carbonic anhydride from it, and that, in general, by blowing air\r\n       or steam through the lime, and even by using moist fuel, it is\r\n       possible to accelerate the decomposition of the calcium carbonate.\r\n       The partial pressure is decreased by these means.\r\n\r\n  [44] Before the introduction of Deville's theory of dissociation, the\r\n       _modus operandi_ of decompositions like that under consideration\r\n       was understood in the sense that decomposition starts at a certain\r\n       temperature, and that it is accelerated by a rise of temperature,\r\n       but it was not considered possible that combination could proceed\r\n       at the same temperature as that at which decomposition goes on.\r\n       Berthollet and Deville introduced the conception of equilibrium\r\n       into chemical science, and elucidated the question of reversible\r\n       reactions. Naturally the subject is still far from being\r\n       clear--the questions of the rate and completeness of reaction, of\r\n       contact, &c., still intrude themselves--but an important step has\r\n       been made in chemical mechanics, and we have started on a new path\r\n       which promises further progress, towards which much has been done\r\n       not only by Deville himself, but more especially by the French\r\n       chemists Debray, Troost, Lemoine, Hautefeuille, Le Chatelier, and\r\n       others. Among other things those investigators have shown the\r\n       close resemblance between the phenomena of evaporation and\r\n       dissociation, and pointed out that the amount of heat absorbed by\r\n       a dissociating substance may be calculated according to the law of\r\n       the variation of dissociation-pressure, in exactly the same manner\r\n       as it is possible to calculate the latent heat of the evaporation\r\n       of water, knowing the variation of the tension with the\r\n       temperature, on the basis of the second law of the mechanical\r\n       theory of heat. Details of this subject must be looked for in\r\n       special works on physical chemistry. _One and the same conception_\r\n       of the mechanical theory of heat _is applicable to dissociation_\r\n       and _evaporation_.\r\n\r\n  [45] But the question as to the formation of a basic calcium carbonate\r\n       with a rise of temperature still remains undecided. The presence\r\n       of water complicates all the relations between lime and carbonic\r\n       anhydride, all the more as the existence of an attraction between\r\n       calcium carbonate and water is seen from its being able to give a\r\n       _crystallo-hydrate_, CaCO_{3},5H_{2}O (Pelouze), which\r\n       crystallises in rhombic prisms of sp. gr. about 1·77 and loses its\r\n       water at 20°. These crystals are obtained when a solution of lime\r\n       in sugar and water is left long exposed to the air and slowly\r\n       attracts carbonic anhydride from it, and also by the evaporation\r\n       of such a solution at a temperature of about 3°. On the other\r\n       band, it is probable that an _acid salt_, CaH_{2}(CO_{3})_{2}, is\r\n       formed in an aqueous solution, not only because water containing\r\n       carbonic acid dissolves calcium carbonate, but more especially in\r\n       view of the researches of Schloesing (1872), which showed that at\r\n       16° a litre of water in an atmosphere of carbonic anhydride\r\n       (pressure 0·984 atmosphere) dissolves 1·086 gram of calcium\r\n       carbonate and 1·778 gram of carbonic anhydride, which corresponds\r\n       with the formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate, and the solution\r\n       of carbonic anhydride in the remaining water. Caro showed that a\r\n       litre of water is able to dissolve as much as 3 grams of calcium\r\n       carbonate if the pressure be increased to 4 and more atmospheres.\r\n       The calcium carbonate is precipitated when the carbonic anhydride\r\n       passes off in the air or in a current of another gas; this also\r\n       takes place in many natural springs. Tufa, stalactites, and other\r\n       like formations from waters containing calcium carbonate and\r\n       carbonic acid in solution are formed in this manner. The\r\n       solubility of calcium carbonate itself at the ordinary temperature\r\n       does not exceed 13 milligrams per litre of water.\r\n\r\n_Calcium carbonate_, CaCO_{3}, is sometimes met with in nature in a\r\ncrystalline form, and it forms an example of the phenomenon termed\r\n_dimorphism_--that is, it appears in two crystalline forms. When it\r\nexhibits combinations of forms belonging to the hexagonal system\r\n(six-sided prisms, rhombohedra, &c.) it is called _calc spar_. Calc spar\r\nhas a specific gravity of 2·7, and is further characterised by a distinct\r\ncleavage along the planes of the fundamental rhombohedron having an angle\r\nof 105°. Perfectly transparent Iceland spar presents a clear example of\r\ndouble refraction (for which reason it is frequently employed in physical\r\napparatus). The other form of calcium carbonate occurs in crystals\r\nbelonging to the rhombic system, and it is then called _aragonite_; its\r\nspecific gravity is 3·0. If calcium carbonate be artificially produced by\r\nslow crystallisation at the ordinary temperature, it appears in the\r\nrhombohedral form, but if the crystallisation be aided by heat it then\r\nappears as aragonite. It may therefore be supposed that calc spar\r\npresents the form corresponding with a low temperature, and aragonite\r\nwith a higher temperature during crystallisation.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Dimorphous bodies differ from true isomers and polymers in that\r\n       they do not differ in their chemical reactions, which are\r\n       determined by a difference in the distribution (motion) of the\r\n       atoms in the molecules, and therefore dimorphism is usually\r\n       ascribed to a difference in the distribution of similar molecules,\r\n       building up a crystal. Although such a hypothesis is quite\r\n       admissible in the spirit of the atomic and molecular theory, yet,\r\n       as in such a redistribution of the molecules a perfect\r\n       conservation of the distribution of the atoms in them cannot be\r\n       imagined, and in every effort of chemical reaction there must take\r\n       place a certain motion among the atoms; so in my opinion there is\r\n       no firm basis for distinguishing dimorphism from the general\r\n       conception of isomerism, under which the cases of those organic\r\n       bodies which are dextro and lævo rotatory (with respect to\r\n       polarised light) have recently been brought with such brilliant\r\n       success. When calcium carbonate separates out from solutions, it\r\n       has at first a gelatinous appearance, which leads to the\r\n       supposition that this salt appears in a colloidal state. It only\r\n       crystallises with the progress of time. The colloidal state of\r\n       calcium carbonate is particularly clear from the following\r\n       observations made by Prof. Famintzin, who showed that when it\r\n       separates from solutions it is obtained under certain conditions\r\n       in the form of grains having the peculiar paste-like structure\r\n       proper to starch, which fact has not only an independent interest,\r\n       but presents an example of a mineral substance being obtained in a\r\n       form until then only known in the organic substances elaborated in\r\n       plants. This shows that the forms (cells, vessels, &c.) in which\r\n       vegetable and animal substances occur in organisms do not present\r\n       in themselves anything peculiar to organisms, but are only the\r\n       result of those particular conditions in which these substances\r\n       are formed. Traube and afterwards Monnier and Vogt (1882) obtained\r\n       formations which, under the microscope, were in every respect\r\n       identical in appearance with vegetable cells, by means of a\r\n       similar slow formation of precipitates (by reacting on sulphates\r\n       of different metals with sodium silicate or carbonate).\r\n\r\n_Calcium sulphate_ in combination with two equivalents of water,\r\nCaSO_{4},2H_{2}O, is very widely distributed in nature, and is known as\r\n_gypsum_. Gypsum loses one and a half and two equivalents of water at a\r\nmoderate temperature,[47] and anhydrous or burnt gypsum is then obtained,\r\nwhich is also known as plaster of Paris, and is employed in large\r\nquantities for modelling.[48] This use depends on the fact that burnt and\r\nfinely-divided and sifted gypsum forms a paste when mixed with water;\r\nafter a certain time this paste becomes slightly heated and solidifies,\r\nowing to the fact that the anhydrous calcium sulphate, CaSO_{4}, again\r\ncombines with water. When the plaster of Paris and water are first made\r\ninto a paste they form a mechanical mixture, but when the mass\r\nsolidifies, then a compound of the calcium sulphate with two molecules of\r\nwater is produced; and this may be regarded as derived from S(OH)_{6} by\r\nthe substitution of two atoms of hydrogen by one atom of bivalent\r\ncalcium. Natural gypsum sometimes appears as perfectly colourless, or\r\nvariegated, marble-like, masses, and sometimes in perfectly colourless\r\ncrystals, _selenite_, of specific gravity 2·33. The semi-transparent\r\ngypsum, or _alabaster_, is often carved into small statues. Besides\r\nwhich an anhydrous calcium sulphate, CaSO_{4}, called _anhydrite_\r\n(specific gravity 2·97), occurs in nature. It sometimes occurs along with\r\ngypsum. It is no longer capable of combining directly with water, and\r\ndiffers in this respect from the anhydrous salt obtained by gently\r\nigniting gypsum. If gypsum be very strongly heated it shrinks and loses\r\nits power of combining with water.[48 bis] One part of calcium sulphate\r\nrequires at 0° 525 parts of water for solution, at 38° 466 parts, and at\r\n100° 571 parts of water. The maximum solubility of gypsum is at about\r\n36°, which is nearly the same temperature as that at which sodium\r\nsulphate is most soluble.[49]\r\n\r\n  [47] According to Le Chatelier (1888), 1-1/2H_{2}O is lost at\r\n       120°--that is, H_{2}O,2CaSO_{4} is formed, but at 194° all the\r\n       water is expelled. According to Shenstone and Cundall (1888)\r\n       gypsum begins to lose water at 70° in dry air. The semi-hydrated\r\n       compound H_{2}O,2CaSO_{4} is also formed when gypsum is heated\r\n       with water in a closed vessel at 150° (Hoppe-Seyler).\r\n\r\n  [48] For stucco-work it is usual to add lime and sand, as the mass is\r\n       then harder and does not solidify so quickly. For imitating\r\n       marble, glue is added to the plaster, and the mass is polished\r\n       when thoroughly dry. Re-burnt gypsum cannot be used over again, as\r\n       that which has once solidified is, like the natural anhydride, not\r\n       able to recombine with water. It is evident that the structure of\r\n       the molecules in the crystallised mass, or in general in any dense\r\n       mass, exerts an influence on the chemical action, which is more\r\n       particularly evident in metals in their different forms (powder,\r\n       crystalline, rolled, &c.)\r\n\r\n  [48 bis] According to MacColeb, gypsum dehydrated at 200° has a\r\n       specific gravity 2·577, and heated to its point of fusion, 2·654.\r\n       Potilitzin (1894) also admits the two above-named modifications of\r\n       anhydrous gypsum, which, moreover, always contain the\r\n       semi-hydrated hydrate (Note 47), and he explains by their relation\r\n       to water the phenomena observed in the solidification of a mixture\r\n       of burnt gypsum and water.\r\n\r\n  [49] As Marignac showed, gypsum, especially when desiccated at 120°,\r\n       easily gives supersaturated solutions with respect to\r\n       CaSO_{4},2H_{2}O, which contain as much as 1 part of CaSO_{4} to\r\n       110 parts of water. Boiling dilute hydrochloric acid dissolves\r\n       gypsum, forming calcium chloride. The behaviour of gypsum towards\r\n       the alkaline carbonates has been described in Chapter X. Alcohol\r\n       precipitates gypsum from its aqueous solutions, because, like the\r\n       sulphates in general, it is sparingly soluble in alcohol. Gypsum,\r\n       like all the sulphates, when heated with charcoal, gives up its\r\n       oxygen, forming the sulphide, CaS.\r\n\r\n       Calcium ulphate, like magnesium sulphate, is capable of forming\r\n       double salts, but with difficulty, and they are chemically less\r\n       stable. They contain, as is always the case with double salts,\r\n       less water of crystallisation than the component salts. Rose,\r\n       Struvé, and others obtained the salt CaK_{2}(SO_{4})_{2},H_{2}O; a\r\n       mixture of gypsum with an equivalent amount of potassium sulphate\r\n       and water solidifies into a homogeneous mass. Fritzsche obtained\r\n       the corresponding sodium salt in a hydrated and anhydrous state,\r\n       by heating a mixture of gypsum with a saturated solution of sodium\r\n       sulphate. The anhydrous salt occurs in nature as _glauberite_.\r\n       Fritzsche also obtained _gaylussite_,\r\n       Na_{2}Ca(CO_{3})_{2},5H_{2}O, by pouring a saturated solution of\r\n       sodium carbonate on to freshly-precipitated calcium carbonate.\r\n       Calcium also forms basic salts, but only a few. Veeren (1892)\r\n       obtained Ca(NO_{3})_{2}Ca(OH)_{2},2-1/2H_{2}O by leaving powdered\r\n       caustic lime in a saturated solution of Ca(NO_{3})_{2} until it\r\n       solidified. This salt is decomposed by water.\r\n\r\nAs lime is a more energetic base than magnesia, so _calcium chloride_,\r\nCaCl_{2}, is not so easily decomposed by water, and its solutions only\r\ndisengage a small quantity of hydrochloric acid when evaporated, and when\r\nthe evaporation is conducted in a stream of hydrochloric acid it easily\r\ngives an anhydrous salt which fuses at 719°; otherwise an aqueous\r\nsolution yields a crystallo-hydrate, CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O, which melts at\r\n30°.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Calcium chloride has a specific gravity 2·20, or, when fused,\r\n       2·12, and the sp. gr. of the crystallised salt CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O is\r\n       1·69. If the volume of the crystals at 0° = 1, then at 29° it is\r\n       1·020, and the volume of the fused mass at the same temperature is\r\n       1·118 (Kopp) (specific gravity of solutions, _see_ Note 27). The\r\n       solution containing 50 p.c. CaCl_{2} boils at 130°, 70 p.c. at\r\n       158°. Superheated steam decomposes calcium chloride with more\r\n       difficulty than magnesium chloride and with greater ease than\r\n       barium chloride (Kuhnheim). Sodium does not decompose fused\r\n       calcium chloride even on prolonged heating (Liés-Bodart), but an\r\n       alloy of sodium with zinc, lead, and bismuth decomposes it,\r\n       forming an alloy of calcium with one of the above-named metals\r\n       (Caron). The zinc alloy may be obtained with as much as 15 p.c. of\r\n       calcium. Calcium chloride is soluble in alcohol and absorbs\r\n       ammonia.\r\n\r\n       A gram molecular weight of calcium chloride in dissolving in an\r\n       excess of water evolves 18,723 calories, and in dissolving in\r\n       alcohol 17,555 units of heat, according to Pickering.\r\n\r\n       Roozeboom made detailed researches on the crystallo-hydrates of\r\n       calcium chloride (1889), and found that CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O melts at\r\n       30·2°, and is formed at low temperatures from solutions containing\r\n       not more than 103 parts of calcium chloride per 100 parts of\r\n       water; if the amount of salt (always to 100 parts of water)\r\n       reaches 120 parts, then tabular crystals of\r\n       CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[Greek: b] are formed, which at temperatures above\r\n       38·4° are converted into the crystallo-hydrates CaCl_{2},2H_{2}O,\r\n       whilst at temperatures below 18° the [Greek: b] variety passes\r\n       into the more stable CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[Greek: a], which process is\r\n       aided by mechanical friction. Hence, as is the case with magnesium\r\n       sulphate (Note 27), one and the same crystallo-hydrate appears in\r\n       two forms--the [Greek: b], which is easily produced but is\r\n       unstable, and the [Greek: a], which is stable. The solubility of\r\n       the above-mentioned hydrates of chloride of calcium, or amount of\r\n       calcium chloride per 100 parts of water, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                      0°  20°   30°    40°  60°\r\n\r\n          CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O            60   75   100     (102·8)\r\n          CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[Greek: a]  --   90   101   117} (154·2)\r\n          CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[Greek: b]  --  104   114    --}\r\n          CaCl_{2},2H_{2}O            --   -- (308·3) 128  137\r\n\r\n       The amount of calcium chloride to 100 parts of water in the\r\n       crystallo-hydrate is given in brackets. The point of intersection\r\n       of the curves of solubility lies at about 30° for the first two\r\n       salts and about 45° for the salts with 4H_{2}O and 2H_{2}O. The\r\n       crystals CaCl_{2},2H_{2}O may, however, be obtained (Ditte) at the\r\n       ordinary temperature from solutions containing hydrochloric acid.\r\n       The vapour tension of this crystallo-hydrate equals the\r\n       atmospheric at 165°, and therefore the crystals may be dried in an\r\n       atmosphere of steam and obtained without a mother liquor, whose\r\n       vapour tension is greater. This crystallo-hydrate decomposes at\r\n       about 175° into CaCl_{2},H_{2}O and a solution; this is easily\r\n       brought about in a closed vessel when the pressure is greater than\r\n       the atmosphere. This crystallo-hydrate is destroyed at\r\n       temperatures above 260°, anhydrous calcium chloride being formed.\r\n\r\n       Neglecting the unstable modification CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[Greek: b],\r\n       we will give the temperatures _t_ at which the passage of one\r\n       hydrate into another takes place and at which the solution\r\n       CaCl_{2} + _n_H_{2}O, the two solids A and B and aqueous vapour,\r\n       whose tension is given as _p_ in millimetres, are able to exist\r\n       together in stable equilibrium, according to Roozeboom's\r\n       determinations:\r\n\r\n        _t_       _n_            A                 B           _p_\r\n       -55°      14·5           ice        CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O     0\r\n       +29·8°     6·1    CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O  CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O     6·8\r\n        45·3°     4·7    CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O  CaCl_{2},2H_{2}O    11·8\r\n       175·5°     2·1    CaCl_{2},2H_{2}O  CaCl_{2},H_{2}O    842\r\n       260°       1·8    CaCl_{2},H_{2}O   CaCl_{2}           Several\r\n                                                            atmospheres\r\n\r\n       Solutions of calcium chloride may serve as a convenient example\r\n       for the study of the supersaturated state, which in this case\r\n       easily occurs, because different hydrates are formed. Thus at 25°\r\n       solutions containing more than 83 parts of anhydrous calcium\r\n       chloride per 100 of water will be supersaturated for the hydrate\r\n       CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n       On the other hand, Hammerl showed that solutions of calcium\r\n       chloride, when frozen, deposit ice if they contain less than 43\r\n       parts of salt per 100 of water, and if more the crystallo-hydrate\r\n       CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O separates, and that a solution of the above\r\n       composition (CaCl_{2},14H_{2}O requires 44·0 parts calcium\r\n       chloride per 100 of water) solidifies as a cryohydrate at\r\n       about -55°.\r\n\r\nJust as for potassium, K = 39 (and sodium, Na = 23), there are the near\r\nanalogues, Rb = 85 and Cs = 133, and also another, Li = 7, so in exactly\r\nthe same manner for calcium, Ca = 40 (and magnesium, Mg = 24), there is\r\nanother analogue of lighter atomic weight, beryllium, Be = 9, besides the\r\nnear analogues strontium, Sr = 87, and barium, Ba = 137. As rubidium and\r\ncæsium are more rarely met with in nature than potassium, so also\r\nstrontium and barium are rarer than calcium (in the same way that bromine\r\nand iodine are rarer than chlorine). Since they exhibit many points of\r\nresemblance with calcium, strontium and barium may be characterised after\r\na very short acquaintance with their chief compounds; this shows the\r\nimportant advantages gained by distributing the elements according to\r\ntheir natural groups, to which matter we shall turn our attention in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the compounds of barium met with in nature the commonest is the\r\n_sulphate_, BaSO_{4}, which forms anhydrous crystals of the rhombic\r\nsystem, which are identical in their crystalline form with anhydrite,\r\nand generally occur as transparent and semi-transparent masses of\r\ntabular crystals having a high specific gravity, namely 4·45, for which\r\nreason this salt bears the name of _heavy spar_ or _barytes_. Analogous\r\nto it is _celestine_, SrSO_{4}, which is, however, more rarely met with.\r\nHeavy spar frequently forms the gangue separated on dressing metallic\r\nores from the vein stuff; this mineral is the source of all other barium\r\ncompounds; for the carbonate, although more easily transformed into the\r\nother compounds (because acids act directly on it, evolving carbonic\r\nanhydride), is a comparatively rare mineral (BaCO_{3} forms the mineral\r\n_witherite_; SrCO_{3}, _strontianite_; both are rare, the latter is\r\nfound at Etna). The treatment of barium sulphate is rendered difficult\r\nfrom the fact that it is insoluble both in water and acids, and has\r\ntherefore to be treated by a method of reduction.[51] Like sodium\r\nsulphate and calcium sulphate, heavy spar when heated with charcoal\r\nparts with its oxygen and forms barium sulphide, BaS. For this purpose a\r\npasty mixture of powdered heavy spar, charcoal, and tar is subjected to\r\nthe action of a strong heat, when BaSO_{4} + 4C = BaS + 4CO. The residue\r\nis then treated with water, in which the barium sulphide is soluble.[52]\r\nWhen boiled with hydrochloric acid, barium chloride, BaCl_{2},\r\nis obtained in solution, and the sulphur is disengaged as gaseous\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, BaS + 2HCl = BaCl_{2} + H_{2}S. In this manner\r\nbarium sulphate is converted into barium chloride,[53] and the latter\r\nby double decomposition with strong nitric acid or nitre gives the less\r\nsoluble barium nitrate, Ba(NO_{3})_{2},[54] or with sodium carbonate a\r\nprecipitate of barium carbonate, BaCO_{3}. Both these salts are able to\r\ngive _barium oxide_, or _baryta_, BaO, and the hydroxide, Ba(HO)_{2},\r\nwhich differs from lime by its great solubility in water,[55] and by the\r\nease with which it forms a crystallo-hydrate, BaH_{2}O_{2},8H_{2}O, from\r\nits solutions. Owing to its solubility, baryta is frequently employed\r\nin manufactures and in practical chemistry as an alkali which has the\r\nvery important property that it may be always entirely removed from\r\nsolution by the addition of sulphuric acid, which entirely separates\r\nit as the insoluble barium sulphate, BaSO_{4}. It may also be removed\r\nwhilst it remains in an alkaline state (for example, the excess which\r\nmay remain when it is used for saturating acids) by means of carbonic\r\nanhydride, which also completely precipitates baryta as a sparingly\r\nsoluble, colourless, and powdery carbonate. Both these reactions show\r\nthat baryta has such properties as would very greatly extend its use\r\nwere its compounds as widely distributed as those of sodium and calcium,\r\nand were its soluble compounds not poisonous. Barium nitrate is directly\r\ndecomposed by the action of heat, barium oxide being left behind. The\r\nsame takes place with barium carbonate, especially that form of it\r\nprecipitated from solutions, and when mixed with charcoal or ignited\r\nin an atmosphere of steam. Barium oxide combines with water with the\r\ndevelopment of a large amount of heat, and the resultant hydroxide is\r\nvery stable in its retention of the water, although it parts with it\r\nwhen strongly ignited.[55 bis] With oxygen the anhydrous oxide gives, as\r\nalready mentioned in Chapters III. and IV., a _peroxide_, BaO_{2}.[56]\r\nNeither calcium nor strontium oxides are able to give such a peroxide\r\ndirectly, but they form peroxides under the action of hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\n  [51] The action of barium sulphate on sodium and potassium carbonates\r\n       is given on p. 437.\r\n\r\n  [52] Barium sulphide is decomposed by water, BaS + 2H_{2}O = H_{2}S\r\n       + Ba(OH)_{2} (the reaction is reversible), but both substances are\r\n       soluble in water, and their separation is complicated by the fact\r\n       that barium sulphide absorbs oxygen and gives insoluble barium\r\n       sulphate. The hydrogen sulphide is sometimes removed from the\r\n       solution by boiling with the oxides of copper or zinc. If sugar be\r\n       added to a solution of barium sulphide, barium saccharate is\r\n       precipitated on heating; it is decomposed by carbonic anhydride,\r\n       so that barium carbonate is formed. An equivalent mixture of\r\n       sodium sulphate with barium or strontium sulphates when ignited\r\n       with charcoal gives a mixture of sodium sulphide and barium or\r\n       strontium sulphide, and if this mixture be dissolved in water and\r\n       the solution evaporated, barium or strontium hydroxide\r\n       crystallises out on cooling, and sodium hydrosulphide, NaHS, is\r\n       obtained in solution. The hydroxides BaH_{2}O_{2} and SrH_{2}O_{2}\r\n       are prepared on a large scale, being applied to many reactions;\r\n       for example, strontium hydroxide is prepared for sugar works for\r\n       extracting crystallisable sugar from molasses.\r\n\r\n       We may remark that Boussingault, by igniting barium sulphate in\r\n       hydrochloric acid gas, obtained a complete decomposition, with the\r\n       formation of barium chloride. Attention should also be turned to\r\n       the fact that Grouven, by beating a mixture of charcoal and\r\n       strontium sulphate with magnesium and potassium sulphates, showed\r\n       the easy decomposability depending on the formation of double\r\n       salts, such as SrS,K_{2}S, which are easily soluble in water, and\r\n       give a precipitate of strontium carbonate with carbonic anhydride.\r\n       In such examples as these we see that the force which binds double\r\n       salts may play a part in directing the course of reactions, and\r\n       the number of double salts of silica on the earth's surface shows\r\n       that nature takes advantage of these forces in her chemical\r\n       processes. It is worthy of remark that Buchner (1893), by mixing a\r\n       40 per cent. solution of barium acetate with a 60 per cent.\r\n       solution of sulphate of alumina, obtained a thick glutinous mass,\r\n       which only gave a precipitate of BaSO_{4} after being diluted with\r\n       water.\r\n\r\n  [53] Barium sulphate is sometimes converted into barium chloride in the\r\n       following manner: finely-ground barium sulphate is heated with\r\n       coal and manganese chloride (the residue from the manufacture of\r\n       chlorine). The mass becomes semi-liquid, and when it evolves\r\n       carbonic oxide the heating is stopped. The following double\r\n       decompositions proceed during this operation: first the carbon\r\n       takes up the oxygen from the barium sulphate, and gives sulphide,\r\n       BaS, which enters into double decomposition with the chloride of\r\n       manganese, MnCl_{2}, forming manganese sulphide, MnS, which is\r\n       insoluble in water, and soluble barium chloride. This solution is\r\n       easily obtained pure because many foreign impurities, such as\r\n       iron, remain in the insoluble portion with the manganese. The\r\n       solution of barium chloride is chiefly used for the preparation of\r\n       barium sulphate, which is precipitated by sulphuric acid, by which\r\n       means _barium sulphate_ is re-formed as a powder. This salt is\r\n       characterised by the fact that it is unacted on by the majority of\r\n       chemical reagents, is insoluble in water, and is not dissolved by\r\n       acids. Owing to this, artificial barium sulphate forms a permanent\r\n       white paint which is used instead of (and mixed with) white lead,\r\n       and has been termed 'blanc fixé' or 'permanent white.'\r\n\r\n       The solution of one part of calcium chloride at 20° requires 1·36\r\n       part of water, the solution of one part of strontium chloride\r\n       requires 1·88 part of water at the same temperature, and the\r\n       solution of barium chloride 2·88 parts of water. The solubility of\r\n       the bromides and iodides varies in the same proportion. The\r\n       chlorides of barium and strontium crystallise out from solution\r\n       with great ease in combination with water; they form\r\n       BaCl_{2},2H_{2}O and SrCl_{2},6H_{2}O. The latter (which separates\r\n       out at 40°) resembles the salts of Ca and Mg in composition, and\r\n       Étard (1892) obtained SrCl_{2},2H_{2}O from solutions at 90-130°.\r\n       We may also observe that the crystallo-hydrates BaBr_{2},H_{2}O\r\n       and BaI_{2},7H_{2}O are known.\r\n\r\n  [54] The nitrates Sr(NO_{3})_{2} (in the cold its solutions give a\r\n       crystallo-hydrate containing 4H_{2}O) and Ba(NO_{3})_{2} are so\r\n       very sparingly soluble in water that they separate in considerable\r\n       quantities when a solution of sodium nitrate is added to a strong\r\n       solution of either barium or strontium chloride. They are obtained\r\n       by the action of nitric acid on the carbonates or oxides. 100\r\n       parts of water at 15° dissolve 6·5 parts of strontium nitrate and\r\n       8·2 parts of barium nitrate, whilst more than 300 parts of calcium\r\n       nitrate are soluble at the same temperature. Strontium nitrate\r\n       communicates a crimson coloration to the flame of burning\r\n       substances, and is therefore frequently used for Bengal fire,\r\n       fireworks, and signal lights, for which purpose the salts of\r\n       lithium are still better fitted. Calcium nitrate is exceedingly\r\n       hygroscopic. Barium nitrate, on the contrary, does not show this\r\n       property in the least degree, and in this respect it resembles\r\n       potassium nitrate, and is therefore used instead of the latter for\r\n       the preparation of a gunpowder which is called 'saxifragin powder'\r\n       (76 parts of barium nitrate, 2 parts of nitre, and 22 parts of\r\n       charcoal).\r\n\r\n  [55] The dissociation of the crystallo-hydrate of baryta is given in\r\n       Chapter I., Note 65. 100 parts of water dissolve\r\n\r\n                          0°   20°  40°  60°   80°\r\n                     BaO  1·5  3·5  7·4  18·8  90·8\r\n                     SrO  0·3  0·7  1·4   3     9\r\n\r\n\r\n       Supersaturated solutions are easily formed.\r\n\r\n       The anhydrous oxide BaO fuses in the oxyhydrogen flame. When\r\n       ignited in the vapour of potassium, the latter takes up the\r\n       oxygen; whilst in chlorine, oxygen is separated and barium\r\n       chloride formed.\r\n\r\n  [55 bis] Brugellmann, by heating BaH_{2}O_{2} in a graphite or clay\r\n       crucible, obtained BaO in needles, sp. gr. 5·32, and by heating in\r\n       a platinum crucible--in crystals belonging to the cubical system,\r\n       sp. gr. 5·74. SrO is obtained in the latter form from the nitrate.\r\n       The following are the specific gravities of the oxides from\r\n       different sources:--\r\n\r\n                                 MgO       CaO       SrO\r\n               from RN_{2}O_{6}  3·38      3·25      4·75\r\n                 \"  RCO_{3}      3·48      3·26      4·45\r\n                 \"  RH_{2}O_{2}  3·41      3·25      4·57\r\n\r\n  [56] The property of barium oxide of absorbing oxygen when heated, and\r\n       giving the peroxide, BaO_{2}, is very characteristic for this\r\n       oxide (_see_ Chapter III., Note 7). It only belongs to the\r\n       anhydrous oxide. The hydroxide does not absorb oxygen. Peroxides\r\n       of calcium and strontium may be obtained by means of hydrogen\r\n       peroxide. Barium peroxide is insoluble in water, but is able to\r\n       form a hydrate with it, and also to combine with hydrogen\r\n       peroxide, forming a very unstable compound having the composition\r\n       BaH_{2}O_{4} (obtained by Professor Schöne), which in course of\r\n       time evolves oxygen (Chapter IV., Note 21).\r\n\r\nBarium oxide is decomposed when heated with potassium; fused barium\r\nchloride is decomposed, as Davy showed, by the action of a galvanic\r\ncurrent, forming metallic _barium_; and Crookes (1862) obtained an\r\namalgam of barium from which the mercury could easily be driven off,\r\nby heating sodium amalgam in a saturated solution of barium chloride.\r\nStrontium is obtained by the same processes. Both metals are soluble in\r\nmercury, and seem to be non-volatile or only very slightly volatile.\r\nThey are both heavier than water; the specific gravity of barium is\r\n3·6, and of strontium 2·5. They both decompose water at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, like the metals of the alkalis.\r\n\r\nBarium and strontium as saline elements are characterised by their\r\npowerful basic properties, so that they form acid salts with difficulty,\r\nand scarcely form basic salts. On comparing them together and with\r\ncalcium, it is evident that the alkaline properties in this group (as\r\nin the group potassium, rubidium, cæsium) increase with the atomic\r\nweight, and this succession clearly shows itself in many of their\r\ncorresponding compounds. Thus, for instance, the solubility of the\r\nhydroxides RH_{2}O_{2} and the specific gravity[57] rise in passing from\r\ncalcium to strontium and barium, while the solubility of the sulphates\r\ndecreases,[58] and therefore in the case of magnesium and beryllium,\r\nas metals whose atomic weights are still less, we should expect the\r\nsolubility of the sulphates to be greater, and this is in reality the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n  [57] Even in solutions a gradual progression in the increase of the\r\n       specific gravity shows itself, not only for equivalent solutions\r\n       (for instance, RCl_{2} + 200H_{2}O), but even with an equal\r\n       percentage composition, as is seen from the curves giving the\r\n       specific gravity (water 4° = 10,000) at 15° (for barium chloride,\r\n       according to Bourdiakoff's determinations):\r\n\r\n              BeCl_{2} : S = 9,992 + 67·21_p_ + 0·111_p_^2\r\n              CaCl_{2} : S = 9,992 + 80·24_p_ + 0·476_p_^2\r\n              SrCl_{2} : S = 9,992 + 85·57_p_ + 0·733_p_^2\r\n              BaCl_{2} : S = 9,992 + 86·56_p_ + 0·813_p_^2\r\n\r\n  [58] One part of calcium sulphate at the ordinary temperature requires\r\n       about 500 parts of water for solution, strontium sulphate about\r\n       7,000 parts, barium sulphate about 400,000 parts, whilst beryllium\r\n       sulphate is easily soluble in water.\r\n\r\nJust as in the series of the alkali metals we saw the metals potassium,\r\nrubidium, and cæsium approaching near to each other in their properties,\r\nand allied to them two metals having smaller combining weights--namely,\r\nsodium, and the lightest of all, lithium, which all exhibited certain\r\npeculiar characteristic properties--so also in the case of the metals\r\nof the alkaline earths we find, besides calcium, barium, and strontium,\r\nthe metal magnesium and also _beryllium_ or _glucinum_. In respect\r\nto the magnitude of its atomic weight, this last occupies the same\r\nposition in the series of the metals of the alkaline earths as lithium\r\ndoes in the series of the alkali metals, for the combining weight of\r\nberyllium, Be or Gl = 9. This combining weight is greater than that\r\nof lithium (7), as the combining weight of magnesium (24) is greater\r\nthan that of sodium (23), and as that of calcium (40) is greater than\r\nthat of potassium (39), &c.[59] Beryllium was so named because it\r\noccurs in the mineral _beryl_. The metal is also called glucinum (from\r\nthe Greek word [Greek: glykys], 'sweet'), because its salts have a\r\nsweet taste. It occurs in beryl, aquamarine, the emerald, and other\r\nminerals, which are generally of a green colour; they are sometimes\r\nfound in considerable masses, but as a rule are comparatively rare\r\nand, as transparent crystals, form precious stones. The composition of\r\nberyl and of the emerald is as follows: Al_{2}O_{3},3BeO,6SiO_{2}. The\r\nSiberian and Brazilian beryls are the best known. The specific gravity\r\nof beryl is about 2·7. Beryllium oxide, from the feebleness of its basic\r\nproperties, presents an analogy to aluminium oxide in the same way\r\nthat lithium oxide is analogous to magnesium oxide.[60] Owing to its\r\nrare occurrence in nature, to the absence of any especially distinct\r\nindividual properties, and to the possibility of foretelling them to\r\na certain extent on the basis of the periodic system of the elements\r\ngiven in the following chapter, and owing to the brevity of this\r\ntreatise, we will not discuss at any length the compounds of beryllium,\r\nand will only observe that their individuality was pointed out in 1798\r\nby Vauquelin, and that metallic beryllium was obtained by Wöhler and\r\nBussy. Wöhler obtained _metallic beryllium_ (like magnesium) by acting\r\non beryllium chloride, BeCl_{2}, with potassium (it is best prepared\r\nby fusing K_{2}BeF_{4} with Na). Metallic beryllium has a specific\r\ngravity 1·64 (Nilson and Pettersson). It is very infusible, melting at\r\nnearly the same temperature as silver, which it resembles in its white\r\ncolour and lustre. It is characterised by the fact that it is very\r\ndifficultly oxidised, and even in the oxidising flame of the blowpipe is\r\nonly superficially covered by a coating of oxide; it does not burn in\r\npure oxygen, and does not decompose water at the ordinary temperature\r\nor at a red heat, but gaseous hydrochloric acid is decomposed by it\r\nwhen slightly heated, with evolution of hydrogen and development of a\r\nconsiderable amount of heat. Even dilute hydrochloric acid acts in the\r\nsame manner at the ordinary temperature. Beryllium also acts easily on\r\nsulphuric acid, but it is remarkable that neither dilute nor strong\r\nnitric acid acts on beryllium, which seems especially able to resist\r\noxidising agents. Potassium hydroxide acts on beryllium as on aluminium,\r\nhydrogen being disengaged and the metal dissolved, but ammonia has no\r\naction on it. These properties of metallic beryllium seem to isolate it\r\nfrom the series of the other metals described in this chapter, but if we\r\ncompare the properties of calcium, magnesium, and beryllium we shall see\r\nthat magnesium occupies a position intermediate between the other two.\r\nWhilst calcium decomposes water with great ease, magnesium does so with\r\ndifficulty, and beryllium not at all. The peculiarities of beryllium\r\namong the metals of the alkaline earths recall the fact that in the\r\nseries of the halogens we saw that fluorine differed from the other\r\nhalogens in many of its properties and had the smallest atomic weight.\r\nThe same is the case with regard to beryllium among the other metals of\r\nthe alkaline earths.\r\n\r\n  [59] We refer beryllium to the class of the bivalent metals of the\r\n       alkaline earths--that is, we ascribe to its oxide the formula BeO,\r\n       and do not consider it as trivalent (Be = 13·5, Chapter VII., Note\r\n       21), although that view has been upheld by many chemists. The true\r\n       atomic composition of beryllium oxide was first given by the\r\n       Russian chemist, Avdéeff (1819), in his researches on the\r\n       compounds of this metal. He compared the compounds of beryllium to\r\n       those of magnesium, and refuted the notion prevalent at the time,\r\n       of the resemblance between the oxides of beryllium and aluminium,\r\n       by proving that beryllium sulphate presents a greater resemblance\r\n       to magnesium sulphate than to aluminium sulphate. It was\r\n       especially noticed that the analogues of alumina give alums,\r\n       whilst beryllium oxide, although it is a feeble base, easily\r\n       giving, like magnesia, basic and double salts, does not form true\r\n       alums. The establishment of the periodic system of the elements\r\n       (1869), considered in the following chapter, immediately indicated\r\n       that Avdéeff's view corresponded with the truth--that is, that\r\n       beryllium is bivalent, which therefore necessitated the denial of\r\n       its trivalency. This scientific controversy resulted in a long\r\n       series of researches (1870-80) concerning this element, and ended\r\n       in Nilson and Pettersson--two of the chief advocates of the\r\n       trivalency of beryllium--determining the vapour density of\r\n       BeCl_{2} = 40, (Chapter VII., Note 21), which gave an undoubted\r\n       proof of its bivalency (_see_ also Note 3).\r\n\r\n  [60] Beryllium oxide, like aluminium oxide, is precipitated from\r\n       solutions of its salts by alkalis as a gelatinous hydroxide,\r\n       BeH_{2}O_{2}, which, like alumina, is soluble in an excess of\r\n       caustic potash or soda. This reaction may be taken advantage of\r\n       for distinguishing and separating beryllium from aluminium,\r\n       because when the alkaline solution is diluted with water and\r\n       boiled, beryllium hydroxide is precipitated, whilst the alumina\r\n       remains in solution. The solubility of the beryllium oxide at once\r\n       clearly indicates its feeble basic properties, and, as it were,\r\n       separates this oxide from the class of the alkaline earths. But on\r\n       arranging the oxides of the above-described metals of the alkaline\r\n       earths according to their decreasing atomic weights we have the\r\n       series\r\n\r\n                      BaO,  SrO,  CaO,  MgO,  BeO,\r\n\r\n       in which the basic properties and solubility of the oxides\r\n       consecutively and distinctly decrease until we reach a point when,\r\n       had we not known of the existence of the beryllium oxide, we\r\n       should expect to find in its place an oxide insoluble in water and\r\n       of feeble basic properties. If an alcoholic solution of caustic\r\n       potash be saturated with the hydrate of BeO, and evaporated under\r\n       the receiver of an air pump, it forms silky crystals BeK_{2}O_{2}.\r\n\r\n       Another characteristic of the salts of beryllium is that they give\r\n       with aqueous ammonia a gelatinous precipitate which is soluble in\r\n       an excess of ammonium carbonate like the precipitate of magnesia;\r\n       in this beryllium oxide differs from the oxide of aluminium.\r\n       Beryllium oxide easily forms a carbonate which is insoluble in\r\n       water, and resembles magnesium carbonate in many respects.\r\n       Beryllium sulphate is distinguished by its considerable solubility\r\n       in water--thus, at the ordinary temperature it dissolves in an\r\n       equal weight of water; it crystallises out from its solutions in\r\n       well-formed crystals, which do not change in the air, and contain\r\n       BeSO_{4},4H_{2}O. When ignited it leaves beryllium oxide, but this\r\n       oxide, after prolonged ignition, is re-dissolved by sulphuric\r\n       acid, whilst aluminium sulphate, after a similar treatment, leaves\r\n       aluminium oxide, which is no longer soluble in acids. With a few\r\n       exceptions, the salts of beryllium crystallise with great\r\n       difficulty, and to a considerable extent resemble the salts of\r\n       magnesium; thus, for instance, beryllium chloride is analogous to\r\n       magnesium chloride. It is volatile in an anhydrous state, and in a\r\n       hydrated state it decomposes, with the evolution of hydrochloric\r\n       acid.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above characteristics of the compounds of the metals\r\nof the alkaline earths, we must add that they, like the alkali metals,\r\ncombine with nitrogen and hydrogen, and while sodium nitride (obtained\r\nby igniting the amide of sodium, Chapter XII., Note 44 bis) and lithium\r\nnitride (obtained by heating lithium in nitrogen, Chapter XIII., Note\r\n39) have the composition R_{3}N, so the nitrides of magnesium (Note 14),\r\ncalcium, strontium, and barium have the composition R_{3}N_{2}, for\r\nexample, Ba_{3}N_{2}, as might be expected from the diatomicity of the\r\nmetals of the alkaline earths and from the relation of the nitrides to\r\nammonia, which is obtained from all of these compounds by the action of\r\nwater. The _nitrides_ of Ca, Sr, and Ba are formed directly (Maquenne,\r\n1892) by heating the metals in nitrogen. They all have the appearance of\r\nan amorphous powder of dark colour; as regards their reactions, it is\r\nknown that besides disengaging ammonia with water, they form cyanides\r\nwhen heated with carbonic oxide; for instance, Ba_{3}N_{2} + 2CO =\r\nBa(CN)_{2} + 2BaO.[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Thus in the nitrides of the metals we have substances by means\r\n       of which we can easily obtain from the nitrogen of the air, not\r\n       only ammonia, but also with the aid of CO, by synthesis, a whole\r\n       series of complex carbon and nitrogen compounds.\r\n\r\nThe metals of the alkaline earths, just like Na and K, absorb hydrogen\r\nunder certain conditions, and form pulverulent easily oxidisable\r\nmetallic hydrides, whose composition corresponds exactly to that of\r\nNa_{2}H and K_{2}H, with the substitution of K_{2} and Na_{2} by the\r\natoms Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. The _hydrides of the metals of the\r\nalkaline earths_ were discovered by C. Winkler (1891) in investigating\r\nthe reducibility of these metals by magnesium. In reducing their oxides\r\nby heating them with magnesium powder in a stream of hydrogen, Winkler\r\nobserved that the hydrogen was absorbed (but very slowly), _i.e._ at\r\nthe moment of their separation all the metals of the alkaline earths\r\ncombine with hydrogen. This absorptive power increases in passing from\r\nBe to Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, and the resultant hydrides retain the combined\r\nhydrogen[62] when heated, so that these hydrides are distinguished\r\nfor their considerable stability under heat, but they oxidise very\r\neasily.[63]\r\n\r\n  [62] As the hydrides of calcium, magnesium, &c. are very stable under\r\n       the action of heat, and these metals and hydrogen occur in the\r\n       sun, it is likely that the formation of their hydrides may take\r\n       place there. (Private communication from Prof. Winkler, 1894.) It\r\n       is probable that in the free metals of the alkaline earths\r\n       hitherto obtained a portion was frequently in combination with\r\n       nitrogen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [63] Thus, for instance, a mixture of 56 parts of CaO and 24 parts of\r\n       magnesium powder is heated in an iron pipe (placed over a row of\r\n       gas burners as in the combustion furnace used for organic\r\n       analysis) in a stream of hydrogen. After being heated for 1/2 hour\r\n       the mixture is found to absorb hydrogen (it no longer passes over\r\n       the mixture, but is retained by it). The product, which is light\r\n       grey, and slightly coherent, disengages a mass of hydrogen when\r\n       water is poured over it, and burns when heated in air. The\r\n       resultant mass contains 33 per cent. CaH, about 28 per cent. CaO,\r\n       and about 38 per cent. MgO. Neither CaH nor any other MH has yet\r\n       been obtained in a pure state.\r\n\r\n       The acetylene derivatives of the metals of the alkaline earths\r\n       C_{2}M (Chapter VIII., Note 12 bis), for instance, C_{2}Ba,\r\n       obtained by Maquenne and Moissan, belong to the same class of\r\n       analogous compounds. It must here be remarked that the oxides MO\r\n       of the metals of the alkaline earths, although not reducible by\r\n       carbon at a furnace heat, yet under the action of the heat\r\n       attained in electrical furnaces, not only give up their oxygen to\r\n       carbon (probably partly owing to the action of the current), but\r\n       also combine with carbon. The resultant compounds, C_{2}M, evolve\r\n       acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}, with HCl, just as N_{2}M_{3} give ammonia.\r\n       We may remark moreover that the series of compounds of the metals\r\n       of the alkaline earths with hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon is a\r\n       discovery of recent years, and that probably further research will\r\n       give rise to similar unexpected compounds, and by extending our\r\n       knowledge of their reactions prove to be of great interest.\r\n\r\nThus the analogies and correlation of the metals of these two groups\r\nare now clearly marked, not only in their behaviour towards oxygen,\r\nchlorine, acids, &c., but also in their capability of combining with\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                         END OF THE FIRST VOLUME\r\n\r\n                               PRINTED BY\r\n\r\n                 SPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\n\r\n                                 LONDON\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    A\r\n                          CLASSIFIED CATALOGUE\r\n                                   OF\r\n                            SCIENTIFIC WORKS\r\n\r\n                              PUBLISHED BY\r\n                     MESSRS.
