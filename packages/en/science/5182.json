Fictitious stories have\r\nbeen the delight of all times and all countries, by oral tradition in\r\nbarbarous, by writing in more civilized ones; and although some persons\r\nof wit and learning have condemned them indiscriminately, I would\r\nventure to affirm, that even those who so much affect to despise them\r\nunder one form, will receive and embrace them under another.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, a man shall admire and almost adore the Epic poems\r\nof the Ancients, and yet despise and execrate the ancient Romances,\r\nwhich are only Epics in prose.\r\n\r\nHistory represents human nature as it is in real life, alas, too often\r\na melancholy retrospect! Romance displays only the amiable side of the\r\npicture; it shews the pleasing features, and throws a veil over the\r\nblemishes: Mankind are naturally pleased with what gratifies their\r\nvanity; and vanity, like all other passions of the human heart, may be\r\nrendered subservient to good and useful purposes.\r\n\r\nI confess that it may be abused, and become an instrument to corrupt the\r\nmanners and morals of mankind; so may poetry, so may plays, so may\r\nevery kind of composition; but that will prove nothing more than the\r\nold saying lately revived by the philosophers the most in fashion, “that\r\nevery earthly thing has two handles.”\r\n\r\nThe business of Romance is, first, to excite the attention; and\r\nsecondly, to direct it to some useful, or at least innocent, end: Happy\r\nthe writer who attains both these points, like Richardson! and not\r\nunfortunate, or undeserving praise, he who gains only the latter, and\r\nfurnishes out an entertainment for the reader!\r\n\r\nHaving, in some degree, opened my design, I beg leave to conduct my\r\nreader back again, till he comes within view of The Castle of Otranto;\r\na work which, as already has been observed, is an attempt to unite the\r\nvarious merits and graces of the ancient Romance and modern Novel.\r\nTo attain this end, there is required a sufficient degree of the\r\nmarvellous, to excite the attention; enough of the manners of real life,\r\nto give an air of probability to the work; and enough of the pathetic,\r\nto engage the heart in its behalf.\r\n\r\nThe book we have mentioned is excellent in the two last points, but\r\nhas a redundancy in the first; the opening excites the attention\r\nvery strongly; the conduct of the story is artful and judicious; the\r\ncharacters are admirably drawn and supported; the diction polished and\r\nelegant; yet, with all these brilliant advantages, it palls upon the\r\nmind (though it does not upon the ear); and the reason is obvious, the\r\nmachinery is so violent, that it destroys the effect it is intended to\r\nexcite. Had the story been kept within the utmost verge of probability,\r\nthe effect had been preserved, without losing the least circumstance\r\nthat excites or detains the attention.\r\n\r\nFor instance; we can conceive, and allow of, the appearance of a ghost;\r\nwe can even dispense with an enchanted sword and helmet; but then they\r\nmust keep within certain limits of credibility: A sword so large as\r\nto require an hundred men to lift it; a helmet that by its own weight\r\nforces a passage through a court-yard into an arched vault, big enough\r\nfor a man to go through; a picture that walks out of its frame; a\r\nskeleton ghost in a hermit’s cowl:--When your expectation is wound up\r\nto the highest pitch, these circumstances take it down with a witness,\r\ndestroy the work of imagination, and, instead of attention, excite\r\nlaughter. I was both surprised and vexed to find the enchantment\r\ndissolved, which I wished might continue to the end of the book; and\r\nseveral of its readers have confessed the same disappointment to me: The\r\nbeauties are so numerous, that we cannot bear the defects, but want it\r\nto be perfect in all respects.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my observations upon this singular book, it seemed to\r\nme that it was possible to compose a work upon the same plan, wherein\r\nthese defects might be avoided; and the keeping, as in painting, might\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nBut then I began to fear it might happen to me as to certain\r\ntranslators, and imitators of Shakespeare; the unities may be preserved,\r\nwhile the spirit is evaporated. However, I ventured to attempt it; I\r\nread the beginning to a circle of friends of approved judgment, and by\r\ntheir approbation was encouraged to proceed, and to finish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ENGLISH BARON: A GOTHIC STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the minority of Henry the Sixth, King of England, when the renowned\r\nJohn, Duke of Bedford was Regent of France, and Humphrey, the good Duke\r\nof Gloucester, was Protector of England, a worthy knight, called\r\nSir Philip Harclay, returned from his travels to England, his native\r\ncountry. He had served under the glorious King Henry the Fifth with\r\ndistinguished valour, had acquired an honourable fame, and was no less\r\nesteemed for Christian virtues than for deeds of chivalry. After the\r\ndeath of his prince, he entered into the service of the Greek emperor,\r\nand distinguished his courage against the encroachments of the Saracens.\r\nIn a battle there, he took prisoner a certain gentleman, by name M.\r\nZadisky, of Greek extraction, but brought up by a Saracen officer; this\r\nman he converted to the Christian faith; after which he bound him to\r\nhimself by the ties of friendship and gratitude, and he resolved to\r\ncontinue with his benefactor. After thirty years travel and warlike\r\nservice, he determined to return to his native land, and to spend the\r\nremainder of his life in peace; and, by devoting himself to works of\r\npiety and charity, prepare for a better state hereafter.\r\n\r\nThis noble knight had, in his early youth, contracted a strict\r\nfriendship with the only son of the Lord Lovel, a gentleman of eminent\r\nvirtues and accomplishments. During Sir Philip’s residence in foreign\r\ncountries, he had frequently written to his friend, and had for a time\r\nreceived answers; the last informed him of the death of old Lord Lovel,\r\nand the marriage of the young one; but from that time he had heard no\r\nmore from him. Sir Philip imputed it not to neglect or forgetfulness,\r\nbut to the difficulties of intercourse, common at that time to all\r\ntravellers and adventurers. When he was returning home, he resolved,\r\nafter looking into his family affairs, to visit the Castle of Lovel, and\r\nenquire into the situation of his friend. He landed in Kent, attended by\r\nhis Greek friend and two faithful servants, one of which was maimed by\r\nthe wounds he had received in the defence of his master.\r\n\r\nSir Philip went to his family seat in Yorkshire. He found his mother\r\nand sister were dead, and his estates sequestered in the hands of\r\ncommissioners appointed by the Protector. He was obliged to prove the\r\nreality of his claim, and the identity of his person (by the testimony\r\nof some of the old servants of his family), after which every thing was\r\nrestored to him. He took possession of his own house, established his\r\nhousehold, settled the old servants in their former stations, and placed\r\nthose he brought home in the upper offices of his family. He then left\r\nhis friend to superintend his domestic affairs; and, attended by only\r\none of his old servants, he set out for the Castle of Lovel, in the west\r\nof England. They travelled by easy journeys; but, towards the evening\r\nof the second day, the servant was so ill and fatigued he could go no\r\nfurther; he stopped at an inn where he grew worse every hour, and the\r\nnext day expired. Sir Philip was under great concern for the loss of his\r\nservant, and some for himself, being alone in a strange place; however\r\nhe took courage, ordered his servant’s funeral, attended it himself,\r\nand, having shed a tear of humanity over his grave, proceeded alone on\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near the estate of his friend, he began to enquire of every\r\none he met, whether the Lord Lovel resided at the seat of his ancestors?\r\nHe was answered by one, he did not know; by another, he could not tell;\r\nby a third, that he never heard of such a person. Sir Philip thought it\r\nstrange that a man of Lord Lovel’s consequence should be unknown in\r\nhis own neighbourhood, and where his ancestors had usually resided. He\r\nruminated on the uncertainty of human happiness. “This world,” said\r\nhe, “has nothing for a wise man to depend upon. I have lost all my\r\nrelations, and most of my friends; and am even uncertain whether any\r\nare remaining. I will, however, be thankful for the blessings that are\r\nspared to me; and I will endeavour to replace those that I have lost. If\r\nmy friend lives, he shall share my fortune with me; his children shall\r\nhave the reversion of it; and I will share his comforts in return.\r\nBut perhaps my friend may have met with troubles that have made him\r\ndisgusted with the world; perhaps he has buried his amiable wife, or\r\nhis promising children; and, tired of public life, he is retired into a\r\nmonastery. At least, I will know what all this silence means.”\r\n\r\nWhen he came within a mile of the Castle of Lovel, he stopped at a\r\ncottage and asked for a draught of water; a peasant, master of the\r\nhouse, brought it, and asked if his honour would alight and take a\r\nmoment’s refreshment. Sir Philip accepted his offer, being resolved to\r\nmake farther enquiry before he approached the castle. He asked the same\r\nquestions of him, that he had before of others.\r\n\r\n“Which Lord Lovel,” said the man, “does your honour enquire after?”\r\n\r\n“The man whom I knew was called Arthur,” said Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said the Peasant, “he was the only surviving son of Richard, Lord\r\nLovel, as I think?”\r\n\r\n“Very true, friend, he was so.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir,” said the man, “he is dead! he survived his father but a\r\nshort time.”\r\n\r\n“Dead! say you? how long since?”\r\n\r\n“About fifteen years, to the best of my remembrance.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said he, “what do we, by living long, but survive all our\r\nfriends! But pray tell me how he died?”\r\n\r\n“I will, sir, to the best of my knowledge. An’t please your honour,\r\nI heard say, that he attended the King when he went against the Welch\r\nrebels, and he left his lady big with child; and so there was a battle\r\nfought, and the king got the better of the rebels. There came first a\r\nreport that none of the officers were killed; but a few days after\r\nthere came a messenger with an account very different, that several were\r\nwounded, and that the Lord Lovel was slain; which sad news overset us\r\nall with sorrow, for he was a noble gentleman, a bountiful master, and\r\nthe delight of all the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“He was indeed,” said Sir Philip, “all that is amiable and good; he was\r\nmy dear and noble friend, and I am inconsolable for his loss. But the\r\nunfortunate lady, what became of her?”\r\n\r\n“Why, a’nt please your honour, they said she died of grief for the loss\r\nof her husband; but her death was kept private for a time, and we did\r\nnot know it for certain till some weeks afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“The will of Heaven be obeyed!” said Sir Philip; “but who succeeded to\r\nthe title and estate?”\r\n\r\n“The next heir,” said the peasant, “a kinsman of the deceased, Sir\r\nWalter Lovel by name.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen him,” said Sir Philip, “formerly; but where was he when\r\nthese events happened?”\r\n\r\n“At the Castle of Lovel, sir; he came there on a visit to the lady, and\r\nwaited there to receive my Lord, at his return from Wales; when the news\r\nof his death arrived, Sir Walter did every thing in his power to comfort\r\nher, and some said he was to marry her; but she refused to be comforted,\r\nand took it so to heart that she died.”\r\n\r\n“And does the present Lord Lovel reside at the castle?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Who then?”\r\n\r\n“The Lord Baron Fitz-Owen.”\r\n\r\n“And how came Sir Walter to leave the seat of his ancestors?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, he married his sister to this said Lord; and so he sold the\r\nCastle to him, and went away, and built himself a house in the north\r\ncountry, as far as Northumberland, I think they call it.”\r\n\r\n“That is very strange!” said Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n“So it is, please your honour; but this is all I know about it.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, friend, for your intelligence; I have taken a long journey\r\nto no purpose, and have met with nothing but cross accidents. This life\r\nis, indeed, a pilgrimage! Pray direct me the nearest way to the next\r\nmonastery.”\r\n\r\n“Noble sir,” said the peasant, “it is full five miles off, the night\r\nis coming on, and the ways are bad; I am but a poor man, and cannot\r\nentertain your honour as you are used to; but if you will enter my poor\r\ncottage, that, and every thing in it, are at your service.”\r\n\r\n“My honest friend, I thank you heartily,” said Sir Philip; “your\r\nkindness and hospitality might shame many of higher birth and breeding;\r\nI will accept your kind offer;--but pray let me know the name of my\r\nhost?”\r\n\r\n“John Wyatt, sir; an honest man though a poor one, and a Christian man,\r\nthough a sinful one.”\r\n\r\n“Whose cottage is this?”\r\n\r\n“It belongs to the Lord Fitz-Owen.”\r\n\r\n“What family have you?”\r\n\r\n“A wife, two sons and a daughter, who will all be proud to wait upon\r\nyour honour; let me hold your honour’s stirrup whilst you alight.”\r\n\r\nHe seconded these words by the proper action, and having assisted his\r\nguest to dismount, he conducted him into his house, called his wife to\r\nattend him, and then led his horse under a poor shed, that served him\r\nas a stable. Sir Philip was fatigued in body and mind, and was glad to\r\nrepose himself anywhere. The courtesy of his host engaged his attention,\r\nand satisfied his wishes. He soon after returned, followed by a youth of\r\nabout eighteen years.\r\n\r\n“Make haste, John,” said the father, “and be sure you say neither more\r\nnor less than what I have told you.”\r\n\r\n“I will, father,” said the lad; and immediately set off, ran like a buck\r\nacross the fields, and was out of sight in an instant.\r\n\r\n“I hope, friend,” said Sir Philip, “you have not sent your son to\r\nprovide for my entertainment; I am a soldier, used to lodge and fare\r\nhard; and, if it were otherwise, your courtesy and kindness would give a\r\nrelish to the most ordinary food.”\r\n\r\n“I wish heartily,” said Wyatt, “it was in my power to entertain your\r\nhonour as you ought to be; but, as I cannot do so, I will, when my son\r\nreturns, acquaint you with the errand I sent him on.”\r\n\r\nAfter this they conversed together on common subjects, like\r\nfellow-creatures of the same natural form and endowments, though\r\ndifferent kinds of education had given a conscious superiority to the\r\none, a conscious inferiority to the other; and the due respect was paid\r\nby the latter, without being exacted by the former. In about half an\r\nhour young John returned.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast made haste,” said the father.\r\n\r\n“Not more than good speed,” quoth the son.\r\n\r\n“Tell us, then, how you speed?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell all that passed?” said John.\r\n\r\n“All,” said the father; “I don’t want to hide any thing.”\r\n\r\n John stood with his cap in his hand, and thus told his tale--\r\n\r\n“I went straight to the castle as fast as I could run; it was my hap to\r\nlight on young Master Edmund first, so I told him just as you had me,\r\nthat a noble gentleman was come a long journey from foreign parts to see\r\nthe Lord Lovel, his friend; and, having lived abroad many years, he did\r\nnot know that he was dead, and that the castle was fallen into\r\nother hands; that upon hearing these tidings he was much grieved and\r\ndisappointed, and wanting a night’s lodging, to rest himself before\r\nhe returned to his own home, he was fain to take up with one at our\r\ncottage; that my father thought my Lord would be angry with him, if he\r\nwere not told of the stranger’s journey and intentions, especially to\r\nlet such a man lie at our cottage, where he could neither be lodged nor\r\nentertained according to his quality.”\r\n\r\nHere John stopped, and his father exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“A good lad! you did your errand very well; and tell us the answer.”\r\n\r\nJohn proceeded--\r\n\r\n“Master Edmund ordered me some beer, and went to acquaint my Lord of the\r\nmessage; he stayed a while, and then came back to me.--‘John,’ said he,\r\n‘tell the noble stranger that the Baron Fitz-Owen greets him well, and\r\ndesires him to rest assured, that though Lord Lovel is dead, and the\r\ncastle fallen into other hands, his friends will always find a welcome\r\nthere; and my lord desires that he will accept of a lodging there, while\r\nhe remains in this country.’--So I came away directly, and made haste to\r\ndeliver my errand.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip expressed some dissatisfaction at this mark of old Wyatt’s\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said he, “that you had acquainted me with your intention\r\nbefore you sent to inform the Baron I was here. I choose rather to lodge\r\nwith you; and I propose to make amends for the trouble I shall give\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir, don’t mention it,” said the peasant, “you are as welcome as\r\nmyself; I hope no offence; the only reason of my sending was, because I\r\nam both unable and unworthy to entertain your honour.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” said Sir Philip, “you should think me so dainty; I am\r\na Christian soldier; and him I acknowledge for my Prince and Master,\r\naccepted the invitations of the poor, and washed the feet of his\r\ndisciples. Let us say no more on this head; I am resolved to stay this\r\nnight in your cottage, tomorrow I will wait on the Baron, and thank him\r\nfor his hospitable invitation.”\r\n\r\n“That shall be as your honour pleases, since you will condescend to stay\r\nhere. John, do you run back and acquaint my Lord of it.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” said Sir Philip; “it is now almost dark.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis no matter,” said John, “I can go it blindfold.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip then gave him a message to the Baron in his own name,\r\nacquainting him that he would pay his respects to him in the morning.\r\nJohn flew back the second time, and soon returned with new commendations\r\nfrom the Baron, and that he would expect him on the morrow. Sir Philip\r\ngave him an angel of gold, and praised his speed and abilities.\r\n\r\nHe supped with Wyatt and his family upon new-laid eggs and rashers of\r\nbacon, with the highest relish. They praised the Creator for His gifts,\r\nand acknowledged they were unworthy of the least of His blessings.\r\nThey gave the best of their two lofts up to Sir Philip, the rest of the\r\nfamily slept in the other, the old woman and her daughter in the bed,\r\nthe father and his two sons upon clean straw. Sir Philip’s bed was of\r\na better kind, and yet much inferior to his usual accommodations;\r\nnevertheless the good knight slept as well in Wyatt’s cottage, as he\r\ncould have done in a palace.\r\n\r\nDuring his sleep, many strange and incoherent dreams arose to his\r\nimagination. He thought he received a message from his friend Lord\r\nLovel, to come to him at the castle; that he stood at the gate and\r\nreceived him, that he strove to embrace him, but could not; but that he\r\nspoke to this effect:--“Though I have been dead these fifteen years,\r\nI still command here, and none can enter these gates without my\r\npermission; know that it is I that invite, and bid you welcome; the\r\nhopes of my house rest upon you.” Upon this he bid Sir Philip follow\r\nhim; he led him through many rooms, till at last he sunk down, and\r\nSir Philip thought he still followed him, till he came into a dark\r\nand frightful cave, where he disappeared, and in his stead he beheld\r\na complete suit of armour stained with blood, which belonged to his\r\nfriend, and he thought he heard dismal groans from beneath. Presently\r\nafter, he thought he was hurried away by an invisible hand, and led into\r\na wild heath, where the people were inclosing the ground, and making\r\npreparations for two combatants; the trumpet sounded, and a voice called\r\nout still louder, “Forbear! It is not permitted to be revealed till\r\nthe time is ripe for the event; wait with patience on the decrees of\r\nheaven.” He was then transported to his own house, where, going into an\r\nunfrequented room, he was again met by his friend, who was living, and\r\nin all the bloom of youth, as when he first knew him: He started at the\r\nsight, and awoke. The sun shone upon his curtains, and, perceiving\r\nit was day, he sat up, and recollected where he was. The images that\r\nimpressed his sleeping fancy remained strongly on his mind waking; but\r\nhis reason strove to disperse them; it was natural that the story he\r\nhad heard should create these ideas, that they should wait on him in his\r\nsleep, and that every dream should bear some relation to his deceased\r\nfriend. The sun dazzled his eyes, the birds serenaded him and diverted\r\nhis attention, and a woodbine forced its way through the window, and\r\nregaled his sense of smelling with its fragrance. He arose, paid his\r\ndevotions to Heaven, and then carefully descended the narrow stairs, and\r\nwent out at the door of the cottage. There he saw the industrious wife\r\nand daughter of old Wyatt at their morning work, the one milking her\r\ncow, the other feeding her poultry. He asked for a draught of milk,\r\nwhich, with a slice of rye bread, served to break his fast. He walked\r\nabout the fields alone; for old Wyatt and his two sons were gone out to\r\ntheir daily labour. He was soon called back by the good woman, who told\r\nhim that a servant from the Baron waited to conduct him to the Castle.\r\nHe took leave of Wyatt’s wife, telling her he would see her again before\r\nhe left the country. The daughter fetched his horse, which he mounted,\r\nand set forward with the servant, of whom he asked many questions\r\nconcerning his master’s family.\r\n\r\n“How long have you lived with the Baron?”\r\n\r\n“Ten years.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a good master?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir, and also a good husband and father.”\r\n\r\n“What family has he?”\r\n\r\n“Three sons and a daughter.”\r\n\r\n“What age are they of?”\r\n\r\n“The eldest son is in his seventeenth year, the second in his sixteenth,\r\nthe others several years younger; but beside these my Lord has several\r\nyoung gentlemen brought up with his own sons, two of which are his\r\nnephews; he keeps in his house a learned clerk to teach them languages;\r\nand as for all bodily exercises, none come near them; there is a\r\nfletcher to teach them the use of the cross-bow; a master to teach them\r\nto ride; another the use of the sword; another learns them to dance; and\r\nthen they wrestle and run, and have such activity in all their motions,\r\nthat it does one good to see them; and my Lord thinks nothing too much\r\nto bestow on their education.”\r\n\r\n“Truly,” says Sir Philip, “he does the part of a good parent, and I\r\nhonour him greatly for it; but are the young gentlemen of a promising\r\ndisposition?”\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed, Sir,” answered the servant; “the young gentlemen, my Lord’s\r\nsons, are hopeful youths; but yet there is one who is thought to exceed\r\nthem all, though he is the son of a poor labourer.”\r\n\r\n“And who is he?” said the knight.\r\n\r\n“One Edmund Twyford, the son of a cottager in our village; he is to\r\nbe sure as fine a youth as ever the sun shone upon, and of so sweet a\r\ndisposition that nobody envies his good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“What good fortune does he enjoy?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Sir, about two years ago, my lord, at his sons request, took\r\nhim into his own family, and gives him the same education as his own\r\nchildren; the young lords doat upon him, especially Master William, who\r\nis about his own age: It is supposed that he will attend the young Lords\r\nwhen they go to the wars, which my Lord intends they shall by and by.”\r\n\r\n“What you tell me,” said Sir Philip, “increases every minute my respect\r\nfor your Lord; he is an excellent father and master, he seeks out merit\r\nin obscurity; he distinguishes and rewards it,--I honour him with all my\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner they conversed together till they came within view of\r\nthe castle. In a field near the house they saw a company of youths, with\r\ncrossbows in their hands, shooting at a mark.\r\n\r\n“There,” said the servant, “are our young gentlemen at their exercises.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip stopped his horse to observe them; he heard two or three of\r\nthem cry out, “Edmund is the victor! He wins the prize!”\r\n\r\n“I must,” said Sir Philip, “take a view of this Edmund.”\r\n\r\nHe jumped off his horse, gave the bridle to the servant, and walked into\r\nthe field. The young gentlemen came up, and paid their respects to him;\r\nhe apologized for intruding upon their sports, and asked which was\r\nthe victor? Upon which the youth he spoke to beckoned to another, who\r\nimmediately advanced, and made his obeisance; As he drew near, Sir\r\nPhilip fixed his eyes upon him, with so much attention, that he seemed\r\nnot to observe his courtesy and address. At length he recollected\r\nhimself, and said, “What is your name, young man?”\r\n\r\n“Edmund Twyford,” replied the youth; “and I have the honour to attend\r\nupon the Lord Fitz-Owen’s sons.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, noble sir,” said the youth who first addressed Sir Philip, “are\r\nnot you the stranger who is expected by my father?”\r\n\r\n“I am, sir,” answered he, “and I go to pay my respects to him.”\r\n\r\n“Will you excuse our attendance, Sir? We have not yet finished our\r\nexercises.”\r\n\r\n“My dear youth,” said Sir Philip, “no apology is necessary; but will you\r\nfavour me with your proper name, that I may know to whose courtesy I am\r\nobliged?”\r\n\r\n“My name is William Fitz-Owen; that gentleman is my eldest brother,\r\nMaster Robert; that other my kinsman, Master Richard Wenlock.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I thank you, gentle Sir; I beg you not to stir another step,\r\nyour servant holds my horse.”\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Sir,” said Master William; “I hope we shall have the pleasure\r\nof meeting you at dinner.”\r\n\r\nThe youths returned to their sports, and Sir Philip mounted his horse\r\nand proceeded to the castle; he entered it with a deep sigh, and\r\nmelancholy recollections. The Baron received him with the utmost respect\r\nand courtesy. He gave a brief account of the principal events that had\r\nhappened in the family of Lovel during his absence; he spoke of the late\r\nLord Lovel with respect, of the present with the affection of a brother.\r\nSir Philip, in return, gave a brief recital of his own adventures\r\nabroad, and of the disagreeable circumstances he had met with since his\r\nreturn home; he pathetically lamented the loss of all his friends, not\r\nforgetting that of his faithful servant on the way; saying he could be\r\ncontented to give up the world, and retire to a religious house, but\r\nthat he was withheld by the consideration, that some who depended\r\nentirely upon him, would want his presence and assistance; and, beside\r\nthat, he thought he might be of service to many others. The Baron agreed\r\nwith him in opinion, that a man was of much more service to the world\r\nwho continued in it, than one who retired from it, and gave his fortune\r\nto the Church, whose servants did not always make the best use of it.\r\nSir Philip then turned the conversation, and congratulated the Baron\r\non his hopeful family; he praised their persons and address, and warmly\r\napplauded the care he bestowed on their education. The Baron listened\r\nwith pleasure to the honest approbation of a worthy heart, and enjoyed\r\nthe true happiness of a parent.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then made further enquiry concerning Edmund, whose appearance\r\nhad struck him with an impression in his favour.\r\n\r\n“That boy,” said the Baron, “is the son of a cottager in this\r\nneighbourhood; his uncommon merit, and gentleness of manners,\r\ndistinguish him from those of his own class; from his childhood he\r\nattracted the notice and affection of all that knew him; he was beloved\r\neverywhere but at his father’s house, and there it should seem that his\r\nmerits were his crimes; for the peasant, his father, hated him, treated\r\nhim severely, and at length threatened to turn him out of doors; he\r\nused to run here and there on errands for my people, and at length they\r\nobliged me to take notice of him; my sons earnestly desired I would take\r\nhim into my family; I did so about two years ago, intending to make him\r\ntheir servant; but his extraordinary genius and disposition have obliged\r\nme to look upon him in a superior light; perhaps I may incur the censure\r\nof many people, by giving him so many advantages, and treating him\r\nas the companion of my children; his merit must justify or condemn my\r\npartiality for him; however, I trust that I have secured to my children\r\na faithful servant of the upper kind, and a useful friend to my family.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip warmly applauded his generous host, and wished to be a sharer\r\nin his bounty to that fine youth, whose appearance indicated all the\r\nqualities that had endeared him to his companions.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of dinner the young men presented themselves before their\r\nLord, and his guest. Sir Philip addressed himself to Edmund; he asked\r\nhim many questions, and received modest and intelligent answers, and\r\nhe grew every minute more pleased with him. After dinner the youths\r\nwithdrew with their tutor to pursue their studies. Sir Philip sat for\r\nsome time wrapt up in meditation. After some minutes, the Baron\r\nasked him, “If he might not be favoured with the fruits of his\r\ncontemplations?”\r\n\r\n“You shall, my Lord,” answered he, “for you have a right to them. I was\r\nthinking, that when many blessings are lost, we should cherish those\r\nthat remain, and even endeavour to replace the others. My Lord, I have\r\ntaken a strong liking to that youth whom you call Edmund Twyford; I\r\nhave neither children nor relations to claim my fortune, nor share my\r\naffections; your Lordship has many demands upon your generosity: I can\r\nprovide for this promising youth without doing injustice to any one;\r\nwill you give him to me?”\r\n\r\n“He is a fortunate boy,” said the Baron, “to gain your favour so soon.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said the knight, “I will confess to you, that the first thing\r\nthat touched my heart in his favour, is a strong resemblance he bears to\r\na certain dear friend I once had, and his manner resembles him as much\r\nas his person; his qualities deserve that he should be placed in a\r\nhigher rank; I will adopt him for my son, and introduce him into the\r\nworld as my relation, if you will resign him to me; What say you?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the Baron, “you have made a noble offer, and I am too much\r\nthe young man’s friend to be a hindrance to his preferment. It is true\r\nthat I intended to provide for him in my own family; but I cannot do it\r\nso effectually as by giving him to you, whose generous affection being\r\nunlimited by other ties, may in time prefer him to a higher station as\r\nhe shall deserve it. I have only one condition to make; that the lad\r\nshall have his option; for I would not oblige him to leave my service\r\nagainst his inclination.”\r\n\r\n“You say well,” replied Sir Philip; “nor would I take him upon other\r\nterms.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed then,” said the Baron; “let us send for Edmund hither.”\r\n\r\nA servant was sent to fetch him; he came immediately, and his Lord\r\nthus bespoke him.\r\n\r\n“Edmund, you owe eternal obligations to this gentleman, who, perceiving\r\nin you a certain resemblance to a friend of his, and liking your\r\nbehaviour, has taken a great affection for you, insomuch that he desires\r\nto receive you into his family: I cannot better provide for you than by\r\ndisposing of you to him; and, if you have no objection, you shall return\r\nhome with him when he goes from hence.”\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Edmund underwent many alterations during this\r\nproposal of his Lord; it expressed tenderness, gratitude, and sorrow,\r\nbut the last was predominant; he bowed respectfully to the Baron and Sir\r\nPhilip, and, after some hesitation, spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I feel very strongly the obligations I owe to this gentleman, for\r\nhis noble and generous offer; I cannot express the sense I have of his\r\ngoodness to me, a peasant boy, only known to him by my Lord’s kind and\r\npartial mention; this uncommon bounty claims my eternal gratitude. To\r\nyou, my honoured Lord, I owe every thing, even this gentleman’s good\r\nopinion; you distinguished me when nobody else did; and, next to you,\r\nyour sons are my best and dearest benefactors; they introduced me to\r\nyour notice. My heart is unalterably attached to this house and family,\r\nand my utmost ambition is to spend my life in your service; but if you\r\nhave perceived any great and grievous faults in me, that make you wish\r\nto put me out of your family, and if you have recommended me to this\r\ngentleman in order to be rid of me, in that case I will submit to your\r\npleasure, as I would if you should sentence me to death.”\r\n\r\nDuring this speech the tears made themselves channels down Edmund’s\r\ncheeks; and his two noble auditors, catching the tender inflection, wiped\r\ntheir eyes at the conclusion.\r\n\r\n“My dear child,” said the Baron, “you overcome me by your tenderness and\r\ngratitude! I know of no faults you have committed, that I should wish to\r\nbe rid of you. I thought to do you the best service by promoting you to\r\nthat of Sir Philip Harclay, who is both able and willing to provide for\r\nyou; but if you prefer my service to his, I will not part with you.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Edmund kneeled to the Baron; he embraced his knees. “My dear\r\nLord! I am, and will be your servant, in preference to any man living; I\r\nonly ask your permission to live and die in your service.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“You see, Sir Philip,” said the Baron, “how this boy engages the heart;\r\nhow can I part with him?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot ask you any more,” answered Sir Philip, “I see it is\r\nimpossible; but I esteem you both still higher than ever; the youth\r\nfor his gratitude, and your lordship for your noble mind and true\r\ngenerosity; blessings attend you both!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” said Edmund, pressing the hand of Sir Philip, “do not think\r\nme ungrateful to you; I will ever remember your goodness, and pray to\r\nHeaven to reward it: the name of Sir Philip Harclay shall be engraven\r\nupon my heart, next to my Lord and his family, for ever.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip raised the youth and embraced him, saying, “If ever you want\r\na friend, remember me; and depend upon my protection, so long as you\r\ncontinue to deserve it.”\r\n\r\nEdmund bowed low, and withdrew, with his eyes full of tears of\r\nsensibility and gratitude. When he was gone, Sir Philip said, “I am\r\nthinking, that though young Edmund wants not my assistance at present,\r\nhe may hereafter stand in need of my friendship. I should not wonder\r\nif such rare qualities as he possesses, should one day create envy,\r\nand raise him enemies; in which case he might come to lose your favour,\r\nwithout any fault of yours or his own.”\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to you for the warning,” said the Baron, “I hope it will\r\nbe unnecessary; but if ever I part with Edmund, you shall have the\r\nrefusal of him.”\r\n\r\n“I thank your Lordship for all your civilities to me,” said the knight;\r\n“I leave my best wishes with you and your hopeful family, and I humbly\r\ntake my leave.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not stay one night in the castle?” returned my Lord; “you\r\nshall be as welcome a guest as ever.”\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge your goodness and hospitality, but this house fills me\r\nwith melancholy recollections; I came hither with a heavy heart, and it\r\nwill not be lighter while I remain here. I shall always remember your\r\nlordship with the highest respect and esteem; and I pray God to preserve\r\nyou, and increase your blessings!”\r\n\r\nAfter some further ceremonies, Sir Philip departed, and returned to old\r\nWyatt’s, ruminating on the vicissitude of human affairs, and thinking on\r\nthe changes he had seen.\r\n\r\nAt his return to Wyatt’s cottage, he found the family assembled\r\ntogether. He told them he would take another night’s lodging there,\r\nwhich they heard with great pleasure;--for he had familiarised himself\r\nto them in the last evening’s conversation, insomuch that they began to\r\nenjoy his company. He told Wyatt of the misfortune he had sustained by\r\nlosing his servant on the way, and wished he could get one to attend\r\nhim home in his place. Young John looked earnestly at his father, who\r\nreturned a look of approbation.\r\n\r\n“I perceive one in this company,” said he, “that would be proud to serve\r\nyour honour; but I fear he is not brought up well enough.”\r\n\r\nJohn coloured with impatience; he could not forbear speaking.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I can answer for an honest heart, a willing mind, and a light pair\r\nof heels; and though I am somewhat awkward, I shall be proud to learn,\r\nto please my noble master, if he will but try me.”\r\n\r\n“You say well,” said Sir Philip, “I have observed your qualifications,\r\nand if you are desirous to serve me, I am equally pleased with you; if\r\nyour father has no objection I will take you.”\r\n\r\n“Objection, sir!” said the old man; “it will be my pride to prefer him\r\nto such a noble gentleman; I will make no terms for him, but leave it to\r\nyour honour to do for him as he shall deserve.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Sir Philip, “you shall be no loser by that; I will\r\ncharge myself with the care of the young man.”\r\n\r\nThe bargain was struck, and Sir Philip purchased a horse for John of\r\nthe old man. The next morning they set out; the knight left marks of his\r\nbounty with the good couple, and departed, laden with their blessing and\r\nprayers. He stopped at the place where his faithful servant was buried,\r\nand caused masses to be said for the repose of his soul; then, pursuing\r\nhis way by easy journeys, arrived in safety at home. His family rejoiced\r\nat his return; he settled his new servant in attendance upon his person;\r\nhe then looked round his neighbourhood for objects of his charity; when\r\nhe saw merit in distress, it was his delight to raise and support it; he\r\nspent his time in the service of his Creator, and glorified him in doing\r\ngood to his creatures. He reflected frequently upon every thing that had\r\nbefallen him in his late journey to the west; and, at his leisure, took\r\ndown all the particulars in writing.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Here follows an interval of four years, as by the manuscript; and this\r\nomission seems intended by the writer. What follows is in a different\r\nhand, and the character is more modern.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT this time the prognostics of Sir Philip Harclay began to be\r\nverified, that Edmund’s good qualities might one day excite envy and\r\ncreate him enemies. The sons and kinsmen of his patron began to seek\r\noccasion to find fault with him, and to depreciate him with others. The\r\nBaron’s eldest son and heir, Master Robert, had several contests with\r\nMaster William, the second son, upon his account: This youth had a warm\r\naffection for Edmund, and whenever his brother and kinsmen treated him\r\nslightly, he supported him against their malicious insinuations. Mr.\r\nRichard Wenlock, and Mr. John Markham, were the sisters sons of the Lord\r\nFitz-Owen; and there were several other more distant relations, who,\r\nwith them, secretly envied Edmund’s fine qualities, and strove to lessen\r\nhim in the esteem of the Baron and his family. By degrees they excited\r\na dislike in Master Robert, that in time was fixed into habit, and fell\r\nlittle short of aversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Wenlock’s hatred was confirmed by an additional circumstance: He\r\nhad a growing passion for the Lady Emma, the Baron’s only daughter;\r\nand, as love is eagle-eyed, he saw, or fancied he saw her cast an eye of\r\npreference on Edmund. An accidental service that she received from\r\nhim, had excited her grateful regards and attentions towards him. The\r\nincessant view of his fine person and qualities, had perhaps improved\r\nher esteem into a still softer sensation, though she was yet ignorant of\r\nit, and thought it only the tribute due to gratitude and friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Christmas time, the Baron and all his family went to visit a family\r\nin Wales; crossing a ford, the horse that carried the Lady Emma, who\r\nrode behind her cousin Wenlock, stumbled and fell down, and threw her\r\noff into the water: Edmund dismounted in a moment, and flew to her\r\nassistance; he took her out so quick, that the accident was not known\r\nto some part of the company. From this time Wenlock strove to undermine\r\nEdmund in her esteem, and she conceived herself obliged in justice\r\nand gratitude to defend him against the malicious insinuations of\r\nhis enemies. She one day asked Wenlock, why he in particular should\r\nendeavour to recommend himself to her favour, by speaking against\r\nEdmund, to whom she was under great obligations? He made but little\r\nreply; but the impression sunk deep into his rancorous heart; every word\r\nin Edmund’s behalf was like a poisoned arrow that rankled in the\r\nwound, and grew every day more inflamed. Sometimes he would pretend to\r\nextenuate Edmund’s supposed faults, in order to load him with the sin\r\nof ingratitude upon other occasions. Rancour works deepest in the heart\r\nthat strives to conceal it; and, when covered by art, frequently puts on\r\nthe appearance of candour. By these means did Wenlock and Markham impose\r\nupon the credulity of Master Robert and their other relations: Master\r\nWilliam only stood proof against all their insinuations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same autumn that Edmund completed his eighteenth year, the Baron\r\ndeclared his intention of sending the young men of his house to France\r\nthe following spring, to learn the art of war, and signalize their\r\ncourage and abilities.\r\n\r\nTheir ill-will towards Edmund was so well concealed, that his patron\r\nhad not discovered it; but it was whispered among the servants, who are\r\ngenerally close observers of the manners of their principals. Edmund\r\nwas a favourite with them all, which was a strong presumption that he\r\ndeserved to be so, for they seldom shew much regard to dependents, or\r\nto superiour domestics, who are generally objects of envy and dislike.\r\nEdmund was courteous, but not familiar with them; and, by this means,\r\ngained their affections without soliciting them. Among them was an old\r\nserving man, called Joseph Howel; this man had formerly served the old\r\nLord Lovel, and his son; and when the young Lord died, and Sir Walter\r\nsold the castle to his brother-in-law, the Lord Fitz-Owen, he only of\r\nall the old servants was left in the house, to take care of it, and to\r\ndeliver it into the possession of the new proprietor, who retained him\r\nin his service: He was a man of few words, but much reflection: and,\r\nwithout troubling himself about other people’s affairs, went silently\r\nand properly about his own business; more solicitous to discharge his\r\nduty, than to recommend himself to notice, and not seeming to aspire to\r\nany higher office than that of a serving man. This old man would fix his\r\neyes upon Edmund, whenever he could do it without observation; sometimes\r\nhe would sigh deeply, and a tear would start from his eye, which he\r\nstrove to conceal from observation. One day Edmund surprised him in this\r\ntender emotion, as he was wiping his eyes with the back of his hand:\r\n“Why,” said he, “my good friend, do you look at me so earnestly and\r\naffectionately?”\r\n\r\n“Because I love you, Master Edmund,” said he; “because I wish you well.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you kindly,” answered Edmund; “I am unable to repay your love,\r\notherwise than by returning it, which I do sincerely.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, sir,” said the old man; “that is all I desire, and more\r\nthan I deserve.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say so,” said Edmund; “if I had any better way to thank you, I\r\nwould not say so much about it; but words are all my inheritance.”\r\n\r\nUpon this he shook hands with Joseph, who withdrew hastily to conceal\r\nhis emotion, saying, “God bless you, master, and make your fortune\r\nequal to your deserts! I cannot help thinking you were born to a higher\r\nstation than what you now hold.”\r\n\r\n“You know to the contrary,” said Edmund; but Joseph was gone out of\r\nsight and hearing.\r\n\r\nThe notice and observation of strangers, and the affection of\r\nindividuals, together with that inward consciousness that always attends\r\nsuperiour qualities, would sometimes kindle the flames of ambition in\r\nEdmund’s heart; but he checked them presently by reflecting upon his\r\nlow birth and dependant station. He was modest, yet intrepid; gentle and\r\ncourteous to all; frank and unreserved to those that loved him, discreet\r\nand complaisant to those who hated him; generous and compassionate\r\nto the distresses of his fellow-creatures in general; humble, but not\r\nservile, to his patron and superiors. Once, when he with a manly spirit\r\njustified himself against a malicious imputation, his young Lord,\r\nRobert, taxed him with pride and arrogance to his kinsmen. Edmund denied\r\nthe charge against him with equal spirit and modesty. Master Robert\r\nanswered him sharply, “How dare you contradict my cousins? do you mean\r\nto give them the lie?”\r\n\r\n“Not in words, Sir,” said Edmund; “but I will behave so as that you\r\nshall not believe them.”\r\n\r\nMaster Robert haughtily bid him be silent and know himself, and not\r\npresume to contend with men so much his superiors in every respect.\r\nThese heart-burnings in some degree subsided by their preparations for\r\ngoing to France. Master Robert was to be presented at court before his\r\ndeparture, and it was expected that he should be knighted. The Baron\r\ndesigned Edmund to be his esquire; but this was frustrated by his\r\nold enemies, who persuaded Robert to make choice of one of his own\r\ndomestics, called Thomas Hewson; him did they set up as a rival to\r\nEdmund, and he took every occasion to affront him. All that Master\r\nRobert gained by this step was the contempt of those, who saw Edmund’s\r\nmerit, and thought it want of discernment in him not to distinguish\r\nand reward it. Edmund requested of his Lord that he might be Master\r\nWilliam’s attendant; “and when,” said he, “my patron shall be knighted,\r\nas I make no doubt he will one day be, he has promised that I shall be\r\nhis esquire.” The Baron granted Edmund’s request; and, being freed from\r\nservitude to the rest, he was devoted to that of his beloved Master\r\nWilliam, who treated him in public as his principal domestic, but in\r\nprivate as his chosen friend and brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole cabal of his enemies consulted together in what manner they\r\nshould vent their resentment against him; and it was agreed that they\r\nshould treat him with indifference and neglect, till they should arrive\r\nin France; and when there, they should contrive to render his courage\r\nsuspected, and by putting him upon some desperate enterprize, rid\r\nthemselves of him for ever. About this time died the great Duke of\r\nBedford, to the irreparable loss of the English nation. He was succeeded\r\nby Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, as Regent of France, of which\r\ngreat part had revolted to Charles the Dauphin. Frequent actions ensued.\r\nCities were lost and won; and continual occasions offered to exercise\r\nthe courage, and abilities, of the youths of both nations.\r\n\r\nThe young men of Baron Fitz-Owen’s house were recommended particularly\r\nto the Regent’s notice. Master Robert was knighted, with several other\r\nyoung men of family, who distinguished themselves by their spirit and\r\nactivity upon every occasion. The youth were daily employed in warlike\r\nexercises, and frequent actions; and made their first essay in arms in\r\nsuch a manner as to bring into notice all that deserved it. Various a\r\n but all their contrivances recoiled upon themselves, and brought\r\nincrease of honour upon Edmund’s head; he distinguished himself upon\r\nso many occasions, that Sir Robert himself began to pay him more than\r\nordinary regard, to the infinite mortification of his kinsmen and\r\nrelations. They laid many schemes against him, but none took effect.\r\n\r\n[From this place the characters in the manuscript are effaced by time\r\nand damp. Here and there some sentences are legible, but not sufficient\r\nto pursue the thread of the story. Mention is made of several actions in\r\nwhich the young men were engaged--that Edmund distinguished himself\r\nby intrepidity in action; by gentleness, humanity and modesty in the\r\ncessations--that he attracted the notice of every person of observation,\r\nand also that he received personal commendation from the Regent.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[The following incidents are clear enough to be transcribed; but the\r\nbeginning of the next succeeding pages is obliterated. However, we may\r\nguess at the beginning by what remains.]\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cabal met in Sir Robert’s tent, Mr. Wenlock thus\r\nbegan:--“You see, my friends, that every attempt we make to humble this\r\nupstart, turns into applause, and serves only to raise his pride still\r\nhigher. Something must be done, or his praise will go home before us,\r\nat our own expence; and we shall seem only soils to set off his glories.\r\nAny thing would I give to the man who should execute our vengeance upon\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Stop there, cousin Wenlock,” said Sir Robert; “though I think Edmund\r\nproud and vain-glorious, and would join in any scheme to humble him,\r\nand make him know himself, I will not suffer any man to use such base\r\nmethods to effect it. Edmund is brave; and it is beneath an Englishman\r\nto revenge himself by unworthy means; if any such are used, I will be\r\nthe first man to bring the guilty to justice; and if I hear another word\r\nto this purpose, I will inform my brother William, who will acquaint\r\nEdmund with your mean intentions.” Upon this the cabal drew back, and\r\nMr. Wenlock protested that he meant no more than to mortify his pride,\r\nand make him know his proper station. Soon after Sir Robert withdrew,\r\nand they resumed their deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen spoke Thomas Hewson: “There is a party to be sent out to-morrow\r\nnight, to intercept a convoy of provisions for the relief of Rouen;\r\nI will provoke Mr. Edmund to make one of this party, and when he is\r\nengaged in the action, I and my companions will draw off, and leave him\r\nto the enemy, who I trust will so handle him, that you shall no more be\r\ntroubled with him.”\r\n\r\n“This will do,” said Mr. Wenlock; “but let it be kept from my two\r\ncousins, and only known to ourselves; if they offer to be of the party,\r\nI will persuade them off it. And you, Thomas, if you bring this scheme\r\nto a conclusion, may depend upon my eternal gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“And mine,” said Markham; and so said all. The next day the affair was\r\npublicly mentioned; and Hewson, as he promised, provoked Edmund to the\r\ntrial. Several young men of family offered themselves; among the rest,\r\nSir Robert, and his brother William. Mr. Wenlock persuaded them not to\r\ngo, and set the danger of the enterprize in the strongest colours. At\r\nlast Sir Robert complained of the tooth-ache, and was confined to his\r\ntent. Edmund waited on him; and judging by the ardour of his own courage\r\nof that of his patron, thus bespoke him:--“I am greatly concerned, dear\r\nSir, that we cannot have your company at night; but as I know what you\r\nwill suffer in being absent, I would beg the favour of you to let me use\r\nyour arms and device, and I will promise not to disgrace them.”\r\n\r\n“No, Edmund, I cannot consent to that: I thank you for your noble offer,\r\nand will remember it to your advantage; but I cannot wear honours of\r\nanother man’s getting. You have awakened me to a sense of my duty: I\r\nwill go with you, and contend with you for glory; and William shall do\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few hours they were ready to set out. Wenlock and Markham, and\r\ntheir dependants, found themselves engaged in honour to go upon an\r\nenterprize they never intended; and set out, with heavy hearts, to join\r\nthe party. They marched in silence in the horrors of a dark night,\r\nand wet roads; they met the convoy where they expected, and a sharp\r\nengagement ensued. The victory was some time doubtful; but the moon\r\nrising on the backs of the English, gave them the advantage. They saw\r\nthe disposition of their enemies, and availed themselves of it. Edmund\r\nadvanced the foremost of the party; he drew out the leader on the French\r\nside; he slew him. Mr. William pressed forward to assist his friend; Sir\r\nRobert, to defend his brother; Wenlock, and Markham, from shame to stay\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Hewson and his associates drew back on their side; the French\r\nperceived it, and pursued the advantage. Edmund pushed them in front;\r\nthe young nobles all followed him; they broke through the detachment,\r\nand stopped the waggons. The officer who commanded the party, encouraged\r\nthem to go on; the defeat was soon complete, and the provisions carried\r\nin triumph to the English camp.\r\n\r\nEdmund was presented to the Regent as the man to whom the victory was\r\nchiefly owing. Not a tongue presumed to move itself against him; even\r\nmalice and envy were silenced.\r\n\r\n“Approach, young man,” said the Regent, “that I may confer upon you the\r\nhonour of knighthood, which you have well deserved.”\r\n\r\n Mr. Wenlock could no longer forbear speaking--“Knighthood,” said he,\r\n“is an order belonging to gentlemen, it cannot be conferred on a\r\npeasant.”\r\n\r\n“What say you, sir!” returned the Regent; “is this youth a peasant?”\r\n\r\n“He is,” said Wenlock; “let him deny it if he can.”\r\n\r\nEdmund, with a modest bow, replied, “It is true indeed I am a peasant,\r\nand this honour is too great for me; I have only done my duty.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York, whose pride of birth equalled that of any man living\r\nor dead, sheathed his sword immediately. “Though,” said he, “I cannot\r\nreward you as I intended, I will take care that you shall have a large\r\nshare in the spoils of this night; and, I declare publicly, that you\r\nstand first in the list of gallant men in this engagement.”\r\n\r\nThomas Hewson and his associates made a poor figure in their return;\r\nthey were publicly reproved for their backwardness. Hewson was wounded\r\nin body and more in mind, for the bad success of his ill-laid design.\r\nHe could not hold up his head before Edmund; who, unconscious of their\r\nmalice, administered every kind of comfort to them. He spoke in their\r\nbehalf to the commanding officer, imputing their conduct to unavoidable\r\naccidents. He visited them privately; he gave them a part of the spoils\r\nallotted to himself; by every act of valour and courtesy he strove to\r\nengage those hearts that hated, envied, and maligned him: But where\r\nhatred arises from envy of superior qualities, every display of those\r\nqualities increases the cause from whence it arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Another pause ensues here.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young nobles and gentlemen who distinguished Edmund were prevented\r\nfrom raising him to preferment by the insinuations of Wenlock and his\r\nassociates, who never failed to set before them his low descent, and his\r\npride and arrogance in presuming to rank with gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here the manuscript is not legible for several pages. There is mention,\r\nabout this time, of the death of the Lady Fitz-Owen, but not the cause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWenlock rejoiced to find that his schemes took effect, and that they\r\nshould be recalled at the approach of winter. The Baron was glad of\r\na pretence to send for them home; for he could no longer endure the\r\nabsence of his children, after the loss of their mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The manuscript is again defaced for many leaves; at length the letters\r\nbecome more legible, and the remainder of it is quite perfect.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time the young men returned from France, the enemies of Edmund\r\nemployed their utmost abilities to ruin him in the Baron’s opinion, and\r\nget him dismissed from the family. They insinuated a thousand things\r\nagainst him, that happened, as they said, during his residence in\r\nFrance, and therefore could not be known to his master; but when the\r\nBaron privately enquired of his two elder sons, he found there was no\r\ntruth in their reports. Sir Robert, though he did not love him, scorned\r\nto join in untruths against him. Mr. William spoke of him with the\r\nwarmth of fraternal affection. The Baron perceived that his kinsmen\r\ndisliked Edmund; but his own good heart hindered him from seeing the\r\nbaseness of theirs. It is said, that continual dropping will wear away a\r\nstone; so did their incessant reports, by insensible degrees, produce a\r\ncoolness in his patron’s behaviour towards him. If he behaved with manly\r\nspirit, it was misconstrued into pride and arrogance; his generosity\r\nwas imprudence; his humility was hypocrisy, the better to cover his\r\nambition. Edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown\r\nupon him; and, though he felt them severely in his bosom, scorned to\r\njustify his conduct at the expence even of his enemies. Perhaps his\r\ngentle spirit might at length have sunk under this treatment, but\r\nprovidence interposed in his behalf; and, by seemingly accidental\r\ncircumstances, conducted him imperceptibly towards the crisis of his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFather Oswald, who had been preceptor to the young men, had a strong\r\naffection for Edmund, from a thorough knowledge of his heart; he saw\r\nthrough the mean artifices that were used to undermine him in his\r\npatron’s favour; he watched their machinations, and strove to frustrate\r\ntheir designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis good man used frequently to walk out with Edmund; they conversed\r\nupon various subjects; and the youth would lament to him the unhappiness\r\nof his situation, and the peculiar circumstances that attended him.\r\nThe father, by his wholesome advice, comforted his drooping heart,\r\nand confirmed him in his resolution of bearing unavoidable evils with\r\npatience and fortitude, from the consciousness of his own innocence, and\r\nthe assurance of a future and eternal reward.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they were walking in a wood near the castle, Edmund asked\r\nthe father, what meant those preparations for building, the cutting down\r\ntrees, and burning of bricks?\r\n\r\n“What,” said Oswald, “have you not heard that my Lord is going to build\r\na new apartment on the west side of the castle?”\r\n\r\n“And why,” said Edmund, “should my Lord be at that expence when there is\r\none on the east side that is never occupied?”\r\n\r\n“That apartment,” said the friar, “you must have observed is always shut\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“I have observed it often,” said Edmund; “but I never presumed to ask\r\nany questions about it.”\r\n\r\n“You had then,” said Oswald, “less curiosity, and more discretion, than\r\nis common at your age.”\r\n\r\n“You have raised my curiosity,” said Edmund; “and, if it be not\r\nimproper, I beg of you to gratify it.”\r\n\r\n“We are alone,” said Oswald, “and I am so well assured of your prudence,\r\nthat I will explain this mystery in some degree to you.”\r\n\r\n“You must know, that apartment was occupied by the last Lord Lovel when\r\nhe was a batchelor. He married in his father’s lifetime, who gave up his\r\nown apartment to him, and offered to retire to this himself; but the son\r\nwould not permit him; he chose to sleep here, rather than in any other.\r\nHe had been married about three months, when his father, the old lord,\r\ndied of a fever. About twelve months after his marriage, he was called\r\nupon to attend the King, Henry the Fourth, on an expedition into Wales,\r\nwhither he was attended by many of his dependants. He left his lady big\r\nwith child, and full of care and anxiety for his safety and return.\r\n\r\n“After the King had chastised the rebels, and obtained the victory, the\r\nLord Lovel was expected home every day; various reports were sent home\r\nbefore him; one messenger brought an account of his health and safety;\r\nsoon after another came with bad news, that he was slain in battle. His\r\nkinsman, Sir Walter Lovel, came here on a visit to comfort the Lady; and\r\nhe waited to receive his kinsman at his return. It was he that brought\r\nthe news of the sad event of the battle to the Lady Lovel.\r\n\r\n“She fainted away at the relation; but, when she revived, exerted the\r\nutmost resolution; saying, it was her duty to bear this dreadful stroke\r\nwith Christian fortitude and patience, especially in regard to the\r\nchild she went with, the last remains of her beloved husband, and the\r\nundoubted heir of a noble house. For several days she seemed an example\r\nof patience and resignation; but then, all at once, she renounced them,\r\nand broke out into passionate and frantic exclamations; she said, that\r\nher dear lord was basely murdered; that his ghost had appeared to her,\r\nand revealed his fate. She called upon Heaven and earth to revenge her\r\nwrongs; saying, she would never cease complaining to God, and the King,\r\nfor vengeance and justice.\r\n\r\n“Upon this, Sir Walter told the servants that Lady Lovel was distracted,\r\nfrom grief for the death of her Lord; that his regard for her was as\r\nstrong as ever; and that, if she recovered, he would himself be her\r\ncomforter, and marry her. In the mean time she was confined in this very\r\napartment, and in less than a month the poor Lady died. She lies buried\r\nin the family vault in St. Austin’s church in the village. Sir Walter\r\ntook possession of the castle, and all the other estates, and assumed\r\nthe title of Lord Lovel.\r\n\r\n“Soon after, it was reported that the castle was haunted, and that the\r\nghosts of Lord and Lady Lovel had been seen by several of the servants.\r\nWhoever went into this apartment were terrified by uncommon noises, and\r\nstrange appearances; at length this apartment was wholly shut up, and\r\nthe servants were forbid to enter it, or to talk of any thing relating\r\nto it: However, the story did not stop here; it was whispered about,\r\nthat the new Lord Lovel was so disturbed every night, that he could\r\nnot sleep in quiet; and, being at last tired of the place, he sold\r\nthe castle and estate of his ancestors, to his brother-in-law the Lord\r\nFitz-Owen, who now enjoys it, and left this country.”\r\n\r\n“All this is news to me,” said Edmund; “but, father, tell me what\r\ngrounds there were for the lady’s suspicion that her lord died\r\nunfairly?”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Oswald, “that is only known to God. There were strange\r\nthoughts in the minds of many at that time; I had mine; but I will\r\nnot disclose them, not even to you. I will not injure those who may be\r\ninnocent; and I leave it to Providence, who will doubtless, in its own\r\nbest time and manner, punish the guilty. But let what I have told you be\r\nas if you had never heard it.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you for these marks of your esteem and confidence,” said\r\nEdmund; “be assured that I will not abuse them; nor do I desire to\r\npry into secrets not proper to be revealed. I entirely approve your\r\ndiscretion, and acquiesce in your conclusion, that Providence will in\r\nits own time vindicate its ways to man; if it were not for that trust,\r\nmy situation would be insupportable. I strive earnestly to deserve the\r\nesteem and favour of good men; I endeavour to regulate my conduct so as\r\nto avoid giving offence to any man; but I see, with infinite pain, that\r\nit is impossible for me to gain these points.”\r\n\r\n“I see it too, with great concern,” said Oswald; “and every thing that I\r\ncan say and do in your favour is misconstrued; and, by seeking to do you\r\nservice, I lose my own influence. But I will never give my sanction to\r\nacts of injustice, nor join to oppress innocence. My dear child, put\r\nyour trust in God: He who brought light out of darkness, can bring good\r\nout of evil.”\r\n\r\n“I hope and trust so,” said Edmund; “but, father, if my enemies should\r\nprevail--if my lord should believe their stories against me, and I\r\nshould be put out of the house with disgrace, what will become of me?\r\nI have nothing but my character to depend upon; if I lose that, I lose\r\nevery thing; and I see they seek no less than my ruin.”\r\n\r\n“Trust in my lord’s honour and justice,” replied Oswald; “he knows your\r\nvirtue, and he is not ignorant of their ill-will towards you.”\r\n\r\n“I know my lord’s justice too well to doubt it,” said Edmund; “but\r\nwould it not be better to rid him of this trouble, and his family of an\r\nincumbrance? I would gladly do something for myself, but cannot without\r\nmy lord’s recommendation; and, such is my situation, that I fear the\r\nasking for a dismission would be accounted base ingratitude; beside,\r\nwhen I think of leaving this house, my heart saddens at the thought, and\r\ntells me I cannot be happy out of it; yet I think I could return to a\r\npeasant’s life with cheerfulness, rather than live in a palace under\r\ndisdain and contempt.”\r\n\r\n“Have patience a little longer, my son,” said Oswald; “I will think\r\nof some way to serve you, and to represent your grievances to my lord,\r\nwithout offence to either--perhaps the causes may be removed. Continue\r\nto observe the same irreproachable conduct; and be assured that Heaven\r\nwill defend your innocence, and defeat the unjust designs of your\r\nenemies. Let us now return home.”\r\n\r\nAbout a week after this conference, Edmund walked out in the fields\r\nruminating on the disagreeable circumstances of his situation.\r\nInsensible of the time, he had been out several hours without perceiving\r\nhow the day wore away, when he heard himself called by name several\r\ntimes; looking backward, he saw his friend Mr. William, and hallooed\r\nto him. He came running towards him; and, leaping over the style, stood\r\nstill a while to recover his breath.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, sir?” said Edmund; “your looks bespeak some tidings\r\nof importance.”\r\n\r\nWith a look of tender concern and affection, the youth pressed his hand\r\nand spoke--\r\n\r\n“My dear Edmund, you must come home with me directly; your old enemies\r\nhave united to ruin you with my father; my brother Robert has declared\r\nthat he thinks there will be no peace in our family till you are\r\ndismissed from it, and told my father, he hoped he would not break with\r\nhis kinsmen rather than give up Edmund.”\r\n\r\n“But what do they lay to my charge?” said Edmund.\r\n\r\n“I cannot rightly understand,” answered William, “for they make a great\r\nmystery of it; something of great consequence, they say; but they will\r\nnot tell me what: However, my father has told them that they must bring\r\ntheir accusation before your face, and he will have you answer them\r\npublicly. I have been seeking you this hour, to inform you of this, that\r\nyou might be prepared to defend yourself against your accusers.”\r\n\r\n“God reward you, sir,” said Edmund, “for all your goodness to me! I\r\nsee they are determined to ruin me if possible: I shall be compelled to\r\nleave the castle; but, whatever becomes of me, be assured you shall have\r\nno cause to blush for your kindness and partiality to your Edmund.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, I am sure of it,” said William; “and here I swear to you, as\r\nJonathan did to David, I beseech Heaven to bless me, as my friendship to\r\nyou shall be steady and inviolable!”\r\n\r\n“Only so long as I shall deserve so great a blessing,” interrupted\r\nEdmund.\r\n\r\n“I know your worth and honour,” continued William; “and such is my\r\nconfidence in your merit, that I firmly believe Heaven designs you for\r\nsomething extraordinary; and I expect that some great and unforeseen\r\nevent will raise you to the rank and station to which you appear to\r\nbelong: Promise me, therefore, that whatever may be your fate you will\r\npreserve the same friendship for me that I bear to you.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was so much affected that he could not answer but in broken\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n“Oh my friend, my master! I vow, I promise, my heart promises!”\r\n\r\nHe kneeled down with clasped hands, and uplifted eyes. William kneeled\r\nby him, and they invoked the Supreme to witness to their friendship,\r\nand implored His blessing upon it. They then rose up and embraced each\r\nother, while tears of cordial affection bedewed their cheeks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were able to speak, Edmund conjured his friend not to\r\nexpose himself to the displeasure of his family out of kindness to him.\r\n\r\n“I submit to the will of Heaven,” said he; “I wait with patience its\r\ndisposal of me; if I leave the castle, I will find means to inform you\r\nof my fate and fortunes.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said William, “that things may yet be accommodated; but do not\r\ntake any resolution, let us act as occasions arise.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner these amiable youths conferred, till they arrived at the\r\ncastle. The Baron was sitting in the great hall, on a high chair with a\r\nfootstep before, with the state and dignity of a judge; before him stood\r\nFather Oswald, as pleading the cause for himself and Edmund. Round the\r\nBaron’s chair stood his eldest son and his kinsmen, with their principal\r\ndomestics. The old servant, Joseph, at some distance, with his head\r\nleaning forward, as listening with the utmost attention to what passed.\r\nMr. William approached the chair. “My Lord, I have found Edmund, and\r\nbrought him to answer for himself.”\r\n\r\n“You have done well,” said the Baron. “Edmund, come hither; you are\r\ncharged with some indiscretions, for I cannot properly call them crimes:\r\nI am resolved to do justice between you and your accusers; I shall\r\ntherefore hear you as well as them; for no man ought to be condemned\r\nunheard.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Edmund, with equal modesty and intrepidity, “I demand my\r\ntrial; if I shall be found guilty of any crimes against my Benefactor,\r\nlet me be punished with the utmost rigour; But if, as I trust, no such\r\ncharge can be proved against me, I know your goodness too well to doubt\r\nthat you will do justice to me, as well as to others; and if it should\r\nso happen that by the misrepresentations of my enemies (who have\r\nlong sought my ruin privately, and now avow it publicly), if by their\r\nartifices your lordship should be induced to think me guilty, I would\r\nsubmit to your sentence in silence, and appeal to another tribunal.”\r\n\r\n“See,” said Mr. Wenlock, “the confidence of the fellow! he already\r\nsupposes that my lord must be in the wrong if he condemns him; and then\r\nthis meek creature will appeal to another tribunal. To whose will he\r\nappeal? I desire he may be made to explain himself.”\r\n\r\n“That I will immediately,” said Edmund, “without being compelled. I only\r\nmeant to appeal to Heaven that best knows my innocence.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true,” said the Baron, “and no offence to any one; man can only\r\njudge by appearances, but Heaven knows the heart; Let every one of\r\nyou bear this in mind, that you may not bring a false accusation, nor\r\njustify yourselves by concealing the truth. Edmund, I am informed that\r\nOswald and you have made very free with me and my family, in some of\r\nyour conversations; you were heard to censure me for the absurdity of\r\nbuilding a new apartment on the west side of the castle, when there was\r\none on the east side uninhabited. Oswald said, that apartment was shut\r\nup because it was haunted; that some shocking murder had been committed\r\nthere; adding many particulars concerning Lord Lovel’s family, such as\r\nhe could not know the truth of, and, if he had known, was imprudent\r\nto reveal. But, further, you complained of ill-treatment here; and\r\nmentioned an intention to leave the castle, and seek your fortune\r\nelsewhere. I shall examine into all these particulars in turn. At\r\npresent I desire you, Edmund, to relate all that you can remember of\r\nthe conversation that passed between you and Oswald in the wood last\r\nMonday.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Edmund, “is it possible that any person could put such\r\na construction upon so innocent a conversation?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me then,” said the Baron, “the particulars of it.”\r\n\r\n“I will, my lord, as nearly as my memory will allow me.” Accordingly he\r\nrelated most of the conversation that passed in the wood; but, in the\r\npart that concerned the family of Lovel, he abbreviated as much as\r\npossible. Oswald’s countenance cleared up, for he had done the same\r\nbefore Edmund came. The Baron called to his eldest son.\r\n\r\n“You hear, Sir Robert, what both parties say; I have questioned them\r\nseparately; neither of them knew what the other would answer, yet their\r\naccounts agree almost to a word.”\r\n\r\n“I confess they do so,” answered Sir Robert; “but, sir, it is very bold\r\nand presuming for them to speak of our family affairs in such a manner;\r\nif my uncle, Lord Lovel, should come to know it, he would punish them\r\nseverely; and, if his honour is reflected upon, it becomes us to resent\r\nand to punish it.” Here Mr. Wenlock broke out into passion, and offered\r\nto swear to the truth of his accusation.\r\n\r\n“Be silent, Dick,” said the Baron; “I shall judge for myself. I\r\nprotest,” said he to Sir Robert, “I never heard so much as Oswald has now\r\ntold me concerning the deaths of Lord and Lady Lovel; I think it is\r\nbest to let such stories alone till they die away of themselves. I had,\r\nindeed, heard of an idle story of the east apartment’s being haunted,\r\nwhen first I came hither, and my brother advised me to shut it up till\r\nit should be forgotten; but what has now been said, has suggested a\r\nthought that may make that apartment useful in future. I have thought of\r\na punishment for Edmund that will stop the mouth of his accusers for\r\nthe present; and, as I hope, will establish his credit with every body.\r\nEdmund, will you undertake this adventure for me?”\r\n\r\n“What adventure, my Lord,” said Edmund? “There is nothing I would not\r\nundertake to shew my gratitude and fidelity to you. As to my courage, I\r\nwould shew that at the expence of my malicious accusers, if respect to\r\nmy Lord’s blood did not tie up my hands; as I am situated, I beg it may\r\nbe put to the proof in whatever way is most for my master’s service.”\r\n\r\n“That is well said,” cried the Baron; “as to your enemies, I am thinking\r\nhow to separate you from them effectually; of that I shall speak\r\nhereafter. I am going to try Edmund’s courage; he shall sleep three\r\nnights in the east apartment, that he may testify to all whether it be\r\nhaunted or not; afterwards I will have that apartment set in order, and\r\nmy eldest son shall take it for his own; it will spare me some expence,\r\nand answer my purpose as well, or better; Will you consent, Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart, my Lord,” said Edmund, “I have not wilfully offended\r\nGod or man; I have, therefore, nothing to fear.”\r\n\r\n“Brave boy!” said my Lord; “I am not deceived in you, nor shall you\r\nbe deceived in your reliance on me. You shall sleep in that apartment\r\nto-night, and to-morrow I will have some private talk with you. Do you,\r\nOswald, go with me; I want to have some conversation with you. The rest\r\nof you, retire to your studies and business; I will meet you at dinner.”\r\n\r\nEdmund retired to his own chamber, and Oswald was shut up with the\r\nBaron; he defended Edmund’s cause and his own, and laid open as much as\r\nhe knew of the malice and designs of his enemies. The Baron expressed\r\nmuch concern at the untimely deaths of Lord and Lady Lovel, and\r\ndesired Oswald to be circumspect in regard to what he had to say of the\r\ncircumstances attending them; adding, that he was both innocent and\r\nignorant of any treachery towards either of them. Oswald excused himself\r\nfor his communications to Edmund, saying, they fell undesignedly into\r\nthe subject, and that he mentioned it in confidence to him only.\r\n\r\nThe Baron sent orders to the young men to come to dinner; but they\r\nrefused to meet Edmund at table; accordingly he ate in the steward’s\r\napartment. After dinner, the Baron tried to reconcile his kinsmen to\r\nEdmund; but found it impossible. They saw their designs were laid open;\r\nand, judging of him by themselves, thought it impossible to forgive or\r\nbe forgiven. The Baron ordered them to keep in separate apartments; he\r\ntook his eldest son for his own companion, as being the most reasonable\r\nof the malcontents; and ordered his kinsmen to keep their own apartment,\r\nwith a servant to watch their motions. Mr. William had Oswald for his\r\ncompanion. Old Joseph was bid to attend on Edmund; to serve him\r\nat supper; and, at the hour of nine, to conduct him to the haunted\r\napartment. Edmund desired that he might have a light and his sword,\r\nlest his enemies should endeavour to surprise him. The Baron thought his\r\nrequest reasonable, and complied with it.\r\n\r\nThere was a great search to find the key of the apartment; at last it\r\nwas discovered by Edmund, himself, among a parcel of old rusty keys in\r\na lumber room. The Baron sent the young men their suppers to their\r\nrespective apartments. Edmund declined eating, and desired to be\r\nconducted to his apartment. He was accompanied by most of the servants\r\nto the door of it; they wished him success, and prayed for him as if he\r\nhad been going to execution.\r\n\r\nThe door was with great difficulty unlocked, and Joseph gave Edmund a\r\nlighted lamp, and wished him a good night; he returned his good wishes\r\nto them all with the utmost cheerfulness, took the key on the inside of\r\nthe door, and dismissed them.\r\n\r\nHe then took a survey of his chamber; the furniture, by long neglect,\r\nwas decayed and dropping to pieces; the bed was devoured by the moths,\r\nand occupied by the rats, who had built their nests there with impunity\r\nfor many generations. The bedding was very damp, for the rain had forced\r\nits way through the ceiling; he determined, therefore, to lie down in\r\nhis clothes. There were two doors on the further side of the room, with\r\nkeys in them; being not at all sleepy, he resolved to examine them;\r\nhe attempted one lock, and opened it with ease; he went into a large\r\ndining-room, the furniture of which was in the same tattered condition;\r\nout of this was a large closet with some books in it, and hung round\r\nwith coats of arms, with genealogies and alliances of the house of\r\nLovel; he amused himself here some minutes, and then returned into the\r\nbed-chamber.\r\n\r\nHe recollected the other door, and resolved to see where it led to; the\r\nkey was rusted into the lock, and resisted his attempts; he set the lamp\r\non the ground, and, exerting all his strength, opened the door, and at\r\nthe same instant the wind of it blew out the lamp, and left him in utter\r\ndarkness. At the same moment he heard a hollow rustling noise, like that\r\nof a person coming through a narrow passage. Till this moment not one\r\nidea of fear had approached the mind of Edmund; but, just then, all the\r\nconcurrent circumstances of his situation struck upon his heart, and\r\ngave him a new and disagreeable sensation. He paused a while; and,\r\nrecollecting himself, cried out aloud. “What should I fear? I have not\r\nwilfully offended God or man; why then should I doubt protection? But I\r\nhave not yet implored the divine assistance; how then can I expect\r\nit!” Upon this, he kneeled down and prayed earnestly, resigning himself\r\nwholly to the will of heaven; while he was yet speaking, his courage\r\nreturned, and he resumed his usual confidence; again he approached the\r\ndoor from whence the noise proceeded; he thought he saw a glimmering\r\nlight upon a staircase before him. “If,” said he, “this apartment is\r\nhaunted, I will use my endeavours to discover the cause of it; and if\r\nthe spirit appears visibly, I will speak to it.”\r\n\r\nHe was preparing to descend the staircase, when he heard several knocks\r\nat the door by which he first entered the room; and, stepping backward,\r\nthe door was clapped to with great violence. Again fear attacked him,\r\nbut he resisted it, and boldly cried out, “Who is there?”\r\n\r\nA voice at the outer door answered, “It’s I; Joseph, your friend!”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” said Edmund.\r\n\r\n“I have brought you some wood to make a fire,” said Joseph.\r\n\r\n“I thank you kindly,” said Edmund; “but my lamp is gone out; I will try\r\nto find the door, however.”\r\n\r\nAfter some trouble he found, and opened it; and was not sorry to see his\r\nfriend Joseph, with a light in one hand, a flagon of beer in the other,\r\nand a fagot upon his shoulder. “I come,” said the good old man, “to\r\nbring you something to keep up your spirits; the evening is cold; I know\r\nthis room wants airing; and beside that, my master, I think your present\r\nundertaking requires a little assistance.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Edmund, “I never shall be able to deserve or\r\nrequite your kindness to me.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, you always deserved more than I could do for you; and I\r\nthink I shall yet live to see you defeat the designs of your enemies,\r\nand acknowledge the services of your friends.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Edmund, “I see little prospect of that!”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Joseph, “something that persuades me you are designed for\r\ngreat things; and I perceive that things are working about to some great\r\nend: have courage, my Master, my heart beats strangely high upon your\r\naccount!”\r\n\r\n“You make me smile,” said Edmund.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see it, sir; may you smile all the rest of your life!”\r\n\r\n“I thank your honest affection,” returned Edmund, “though it is too\r\npartial to me. You had better go to bed, however; if it is known that\r\nyou visit me here, it will be bad for us both.”\r\n\r\n“So I will presently; but, please God, I will come here again to-morrow\r\nnight, when all the family are a-bed; and I will tell you some things\r\nthat you never yet heard.”\r\n\r\n“But pray tell me,” said Edmund, “where does that door lead to?”\r\n\r\n“Upon a passage that ends in a staircase that leads to the lower rooms;\r\nand there is likewise a door out of that passage into the dining-room.”\r\n\r\n“And what rooms are there below stairs,” said Edmund?\r\n\r\n“The same as above,” replied he.\r\n\r\n“Very well; then I wish you a good night, we will talk further\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, to-morrow night; and in this place, my dear master.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you call me your master? I never was, nor ever can be, your\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n“God only knows that,” said the good old man; “good-night, and heaven\r\nbless you!”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, my worthy friend!”\r\n\r\nJoseph withdrew, and Edmund returned to the other door, and attempted\r\nseveral times to open it in vain; his hands were benumbed and tired; at\r\nlength he gave over. He made a fire in the chimney, placed the lamp on a\r\ntable, and opened one of the window-shutters to admit the day-light;\r\nhe then recommended himself to the Divine protection, and threw himself\r\nupon the bed; he presently fell asleep, and continued in that state,\r\ntill the sun saluted him with his orient beams through the window he had\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was perfectly awake, he strove to recollect his dreams.\r\nHe thought that he heard people coming up the staircase that he had a\r\nglimpse of; that the door opened, and there entered a warrior, leading a\r\nlady by the hand, who was young and beautiful, but pale and wan; The man\r\nwas dressed in complete armour, and his helmet down. They approached\r\nthe bed; they undrew the curtains. He thought the man said, “Is this our\r\nchild?” The woman replied, “It is; and the hour approaches that he shall\r\nbe known for such.” They then separated, and one stood on each side\r\nof the bed; their hands met over his head, and they gave him a solemn\r\nbenediction. He strove to rise and pay them his respects, but they\r\nforbad him; and the lady said, “Sleep in peace, oh my Edmund! for\r\nthose who are the true possessors of this apartment are employed in\r\nthy preservation; sleep on, sweet hope of a house that is thought past\r\nhope!”\r\n\r\nUpon this, they withdrew, and went out at the same door by which they\r\nentered, and he heard them descend the stairs. After this, he followed\r\na funeral as chief mourner; he saw the whole procession, and heard the\r\nceremonies performed. He was snatched away from this mournful scene to\r\none of a contrary kind, a stately feast, at which he presided; and\r\nhe heard himself congratulated as a husband, and a father; his\r\nfriend William sat by his side; and his happiness was complete. Every\r\nsucceeding idea was happiness without allay; and his mind was not idle\r\na moment till the morning sun awakened him. He perfectly remembered his\r\ndreams, and meditated on what all these things should portend. “Am I\r\nthen,” said he, “not Edmund Twyford, but somebody of consequence in\r\nwhose fate so many people are interested? Vain thought, that must have\r\narisen from the partial suggestion of my two friends, Mr. William and\r\nold Joseph.”\r\n\r\nHe lay thus reflecting, when a servant knocked at his door, and told him\r\nit was past six o’clock, and that the Baron expected him to breakfast in\r\nan hour. He rose immediately; paid his tribute of thanks to heaven for\r\nits protection, and went from his chamber in high health and spirits. He\r\nwalked in the garden till the hour of breakfast, and then attended the\r\nBaron.\r\n\r\n“Good morrow, Edmund!” said he; “how have you rested in your new\r\napartment?”\r\n\r\n“Extremely well, my lord,” answered he.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it,” said the Baron; “but I did not know your\r\naccommodations were so bad, as Joseph tells me they are.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis of no consequence,” said Edmund; “if they were much worse, I could\r\ndispense with them for three nights.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Baron; “you are a brave lad; I am satisfied with\r\nyou, and will excuse the other two nights.”\r\n\r\n“But, my lord, I will not be excused; no one shall have reason to\r\nsuspect my courage; I am determined to go through the remaining nights\r\nupon many accounts.”\r\n\r\n“That shall be as you please,” said my Lord. “I think of you as you\r\ndeserve; so well, that I shall ask your advice by and by in some affairs\r\nof consequence.”\r\n\r\n“My life and services are yours, my lord; command them freely.”\r\n\r\n“Let Oswald be called in,” said my Lord; “he shall be one of our\r\nconsultation.” He came; the servants were dismissed; and the Baron spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Edmund, when first I took you into my family, it was at the request of\r\nmy sons and kinsmen; I bear witness to your good behaviour, you have not\r\ndeserved to lose their esteem; but, nevertheless, I have observed\r\nfor some years past, that all but my son William have set their faces\r\nagainst you; I see their meanness, and I perceive their motives: but\r\nthey are, and must be, my relations; and I would rather govern them by\r\nlove, than fear. I love and esteem your virtues: I cannot give you up\r\nto gratify their humours. My son William has lost the affections of the\r\nrest, for that he bears to you; but he has increased my regard for him;\r\nI think myself bound in honour to him and you to provide for you; I\r\ncannot do it, as I wished, under my own roof. If you stay here, I see\r\nnothing but confusion in my family; yet I cannot put you out of it\r\ndisgracefully. I want to think of some way to prefer you, that you may\r\nleave this house with honour; and I desire both of you to give me your\r\nadvice in this matter. If Edmund will tell me in what way I can employ\r\nhim to his own honour and my advantage, I am ready to do it; let him\r\npropose it, and Oswald shall moderate between us.”\r\n\r\nHere he stopped; and Edmund, whose sighs almost choked him, threw\r\nhimself at the Baron’s feet, and wet his hand with his tears: “Oh, my\r\nnoble, generous benefactor! do you condescend to consult such a one as\r\nme upon the state of your family? does your most amiable and beloved son\r\nincur the ill-will of his brothers and kinsmen for my sake? What am I,\r\nthat I should disturb the peace of this noble family? Oh, my lord, send\r\nme away directly! I should be unworthy to live, if I did not earnestly\r\nendeavour to restore your happiness. You have given me a noble\r\neducation, and I trust I shall not disgrace it. If you will recommend\r\nme, and give me a character, I fear not to make my own fortune.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron wiped his eyes; “I wish to do this, my child, but in what way?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Edmund, “I will open my heart to you. I have served with\r\ncredit in the army, and I should prefer a soldier’s life.”\r\n\r\n“You please me well,” said the Baron; “I will send you to France, and\r\ngive you a recommendation to the Regent; he knows you personally, and\r\nwill prefer you, for my sake, and for your own merit.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, you overwhelm me with your goodness! I am but your creature,\r\nand my life shall be devoted to your service.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the Baron, “how to dispose of you till the spring?”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Oswald, “may be thought of at leisure; I am glad that you\r\nhave resolved, and I congratulate you both.” The Baron put an end to the\r\nconversation by desiring Edmund to go with him into the menage to see\r\nhis horses. He ordered Oswald to acquaint his son William with all that\r\nhad passed, and to try to persuade the young men to meet Edmund and\r\nWilliam at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe Baron took Edmund with him into his menage to see some horses he had\r\nlately purchased; while they were examining the beauties and defects\r\nof these noble and useful animals, Edmund declared that he preferred\r\nCaradoc, a horse he had broke himself, to any other in my lord’s\r\nstables. “Then,” said the Baron, “I will give him to you; and you shall\r\ngo upon him to seek your fortune.” He made new acknowledgments for this\r\ngift, and declared he would prize it highly for the giver’s sake. “But\r\nI shall not part with you yet,” said my lord; “I will first carry all my\r\npoints with these saucy boys, and oblige them to do you justice.”\r\n\r\n“You have already done that,” said Edmund; “and I will not suffer any\r\nof your Lordship’s blood to undergo any farther humiliation upon my\r\naccount. I think, with humble submission to your better judgment, the\r\nsooner I go hence the better.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking, Oswald came to them, and said, that the young\r\nmen had absolutely refused to dine at the table, if Edmund was present.\r\n“‘Tis well,” said the Baron; “I shall find a way to punish their\r\ncontumacy hereafter; I will make them know that I am the master here.\r\nEdmund and you, Oswald, shall spend the day in my apartment above\r\nstairs. William shall dine with me alone; and I will acquaint him with\r\nour determination; my son Robert, and his cabal, shall be prisoners in\r\nthe great parlour. Edmund shall, according to his own desire, spend this\r\nand the following night in the haunted apartment; and this for his sake,\r\nand my own; for if I should now contradict my former orders, it would\r\nsubject us both to their impertinent reflections.”\r\n\r\nHe then took Oswald aside, and charged him not to let Edmund go out of\r\nhis sight; for if he should come in the way of those implacable enemies,\r\nhe trembled for the consequences. He then walked back to the stables,\r\nand the two friends returned into the house.\r\n\r\nThey had a long conversation on various subjects; in the course of it,\r\nEdmund acquainted Oswald with all that had passed between him and Joseph\r\nthe preceding night, the curiosity he had raised in him, and his promise\r\nto gratify it the night following.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said Oswald, “you would permit me to be one of your party.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be?” said Edmund; “we shall be watched, perhaps; and, if\r\ndiscovered, what excuse can you make for coming there? Beside, if it\r\nwere known, I shall be branded with the imputation of cowardice; and,\r\nthough I have borne much, I will not promise to bear that patiently.”\r\n\r\n“Never fear,” replied Oswald, “I will speak to Joseph about it; and,\r\nafter prayers are over and the family gone to bed, I will steal away\r\nfrom my own chamber and come to you. I am strongly interested in your\r\naffairs; and I cannot be easy unless you will receive me into your\r\ncompany; I will bind myself to secrecy in any manner you shall enjoin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your word is sufficient,” said Edmund; “I have as much reason to trust\r\nyou, father, as any man living; I should be ungrateful to refuse you any\r\nthing in my power to grant; But suppose the apartment should really be\r\nhaunted, would you have resolution enough to pursue the adventure to a\r\ndiscovery?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Oswald; “but have you any reason to believe it is?”\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Edmund; “but I have not opened my lips upon this subject\r\nto any creature but yourself. This night I purpose, if Heaven permit,\r\nto go all over the rooms; and, though I had formed this design, I will\r\nconfess that your company will strengthen my resolution. I will have no\r\nreserves to you in any respect; but I must put a seal upon your lips.”\r\n\r\nOswald swore secrecy till he should be permitted to disclose the\r\nmysteries of that apartment; and both of them waited, in solemn\r\nexpectation, the event of the approaching night.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. William was allowed to visit his friend. An\r\naffecting interview passed between them. He lamented the necessity of\r\nEdmund’s departure; and they took a solemn leave of each other, as if\r\nthey foreboded it would be long ere they should meet again.\r\n\r\nAbout the same hour as the preceding evening, Joseph came to conduct\r\nEdmund to his apartment.\r\n\r\n“You will find better accommodations than you had last night,” said he,\r\n“and all by my lord’s own order.”\r\n\r\n“I every hour receive some new proof of his goodness,” said Edmund.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, he found a good fire in the chamber, and a table\r\ncovered with cold meats, and a flagon of strong beer.\r\n\r\n“Sit down and get your supper, my dear Master,” said Joseph: “I must\r\nattend my Lord; but as soon as the family are gone to bed, I will visit\r\nyou again.”\r\n\r\n“Do so,” said Edmund; “but first, see Father Oswald; he has something to\r\nsay to you. You may trust him, for I have no reserves to him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Sir, I will see him if you desire it; and I will come to you as\r\nsoon as possible.” So saying, he went his way, and Edmund sat down to\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nAfter a moderate refreshment, he kneeled down, and prayed with the\r\ngreatest fervency. He resigned himself to the disposal of Heaven: “I\r\nam nothing,” said he, “I desire to be nothing but what thou, O Lord,\r\npleasest to make me. If it is thy will that I should return to my former\r\nobscurity, be it obeyed with cheerfulness; and, if thou art pleased to\r\nexalt me, I will look up to thee, as the only fountain of honour and\r\ndignity.” While he prayed, he felt an enlargement of heart beyond what\r\nhe had ever experienced before; all idle fears were dispersed, and his\r\nheart glowed with divine love and affiance;--he seemed raised above the\r\nworld and all its pursuits. He continued wrapt up in mental devotion,\r\ntill a knocking at the door obliged him to rise, and let in his two\r\nfriends, who came without shoes, and on tiptoe, to visit him.\r\n\r\n“Save you, my son!” said the friar; “you look cheerful and happy.”\r\n\r\n“I am so, father,” said Edmund; “I have resigned myself to the disposal\r\nof Heaven, and I find my heart strengthened above what I can express.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven be praised!” said Oswald: “I believe you are designed for great\r\nthings, my son.”\r\n\r\n“What! do you too encourage my ambition?” says Edmund; “strange\r\nconcurrence of circumstances!--Sit down, my friends; and do you, my\r\ngood Joseph, tell me the particulars you promised last night.” They drew\r\ntheir chairs round the fire, and Joseph began as follows:--\r\n\r\n“You have heard of the untimely death of the late Lord Lovel, my noble\r\nand worthy master; perhaps you may have also heard that, from that time,\r\nthis apartment was haunted. What passed the other day, when my Lord\r\nquestioned you both on this head, brought all the circumstances fresh\r\ninto my mind. You then said, there were suspicions that he came not\r\nfairly to his end. I trust you both, and will speak what I know of it.\r\nThere was a person suspected of this murder; and whom do you think it\r\nwas?”\r\n\r\n“You must speak out,” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Why then,” said Joseph, “it was the present Lord Lovel.”\r\n\r\n“You speak my thoughts,” said Oswald; “but proceed to the proofs.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said Joseph.\r\n\r\n“From the time that my lord’s death was reported, there were strange\r\nwhisperings and consultations between the new lord and some of the\r\nservants; there was a deal of private business carried on in this\r\napartment. Soon after, they gave out that my poor lady was distracted;\r\nbut she threw out strong expressions that savoured nothing of madness.\r\nShe said, that the ghost of her departed lord had appeared to her, and\r\nrevealed the circumstances of this murder. None of the servants, but\r\none, were permitted to see her. At this very time, Sir Walter, the new\r\nlord, had the cruelty to offer love to her; he urged her to marry him;\r\nand one of her women overheard her say, she would sooner die than give\r\nher hand to the man who caused the death of her Lord; Soon after\r\nthis, we were told my Lady was dead. The Lord Lovel made a public and\r\nsumptuous funeral for her.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said Oswald; “for I was a novice, and assisted at it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Joseph, “now comes my part of the story. As I was coming\r\nhome from the burial, I overtook Roger our ploughman. Said he, What\r\nthink you of this burying?--‘What should I think,’ said I, ‘but that we\r\nhave lost the best Master and Lady that we shall ever know?’ ‘God, He\r\nknows,’ quoth Roger, ‘whether they be living or dead; but if ever I\r\nsaw my Lady in my life, I saw her alive the night they say she died.’ I\r\ntried to convince him that he was mistaken; but he offered to take his\r\noath, that the very night they said she died, he saw her come out at the\r\ngarden gate into the fields; that she often stopped, like a person in\r\npain, and then went forward again until he lost sight of her. Now it is\r\ncertain that her time was out, and she expected to lie down every day;\r\nand they did not pretend that she died in child-bed. I thought upon\r\nwhat I heard, but nothing I said. Roger told the same story to another\r\nservant; so he was called to an account, the story was hushed up, and\r\nthe foolish fellow said, he was verily persuaded it was her ghost that\r\nhe saw. Now you must take notice that, from this time, they began to\r\ntalk about, that this apartment was troubled; and not only this, but\r\nat last the new Lord could not sleep in quiet in his own room; and this\r\ninduced him to sell the castle to his brother-in-law, and get out of\r\nthis country as fast as possible. He took most of the servants away with\r\nhim, and Roger among the rest. As for me, they thought I knew nothing,\r\nand so they left me behind; but I was neither blind nor deaf, though I\r\ncould hear, and see, and say nothing.”\r\n\r\n“This is a dark story,” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“It is so,” said Edmund; “but why should Joseph seem to think it\r\nconcerns me in particular?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, dear Sir,” said Joseph, “I must tell you, though I never uttered it\r\nto mortal man before; the striking resemblance this young man bears to\r\nmy dear Lord, the strange dislike his reputed father took to him, his\r\ngentle manners, his generous heart, his noble qualities so uncommon in\r\nthose of his birth and breeding, the sound of his voice--you may smile\r\nat the strength of my fancy, but I cannot put it out of my mind but that\r\nhe is my own master’s son.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Edmund changed colour and trembled; he clapped his hand\r\nupon his breast, and looked up to Heaven in silence; his dream recurred\r\nto his memory, and struck upon his heart. He related it to his attentive\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\n“The ways of Providence are wonderful,” said Oswald. “If this be so,\r\nHeaven in its own time will make it appear.”\r\n\r\nHere a silence of several minutes ensued; when, suddenly, they were\r\nawakened from their reverie by a violent noise in the rooms underneath\r\nthem. It seemed like the clashing of arms, and something seemed to fall\r\ndown with violence.\r\n\r\nThey started, and Edmund rose up with a look full of resolution and\r\nintrepidity.\r\n\r\n“I am called!” said he; “I obey the call!”\r\n\r\nHe took up a lamp, and went to the door that he had opened the night\r\nbefore. Oswald followed with his rosary in his hand, and Joseph last\r\nwith trembling steps. The door opened with ease, and they descended the\r\nstairs in profound silence.\r\n\r\nThe lower rooms answered exactly to those above; there were two parlours\r\nand a large closet. They saw nothing remarkable in these rooms, except\r\ntwo pictures, that were turned with their faces to the wall. Joseph took\r\nthe courage to turn them. “These,” said he, “are the portraits of my\r\nlord and lady. Father, look at this face; do you know who is like it?”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” said Oswald, “it was done for Edmund!”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said Edmund, “struck with the resemblance myself; but let us go\r\non; I feel myself inspired with unusual courage. Let us open the closet\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\nOswald stopped him short.\r\n\r\n“Take heed,” said he, “lest the wind of the door put out the lamp. I\r\nwill open this door.”\r\n\r\nHe attempted it without success; Joseph did the same, but to no purpose;\r\nEdmund gave the lamp to Joseph; he approached the door, tried the key,\r\nand it gave way to his hand in a moment.\r\n\r\n“This adventure belongs,” said he, “to me only; that is plain--bring the\r\nlamp forward.”\r\n\r\nOswald repeated the paternoster, in which they all joined, and then\r\nentered the closet.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that presented itself to their view, was a complete suit\r\nof armour, that seemed to have fallen down on an heap.\r\n\r\n“Behold!” said Edmund; “this made the noise we heard above.” They took\r\nit up, and examined it piece by piece; the inside of the breast plate\r\nwas stained with blood.\r\n\r\n“See here!” said Edmund; “what think you of this?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis my Lord’s armour,” said Joseph; “I know it well--here has been\r\nbloody work in this closet!”\r\n\r\nGoing forward, he stumbled over something; it was a ring with the arms\r\nof Lovel engraved upon it.\r\n\r\n“This is my Lord’s ring,” said Joseph; “I have seen him wear it; I give\r\nit to you, sir, as the right owner; and most religiously do I believe\r\nyou his son.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven only knows that,” said Edmund; “and, if it permits, I will know\r\nwho was my father before I am a day older.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, he shifted his ground, and perceived that the\r\nboards rose up on the other side of the closet; upon farther examination\r\nthey found that the whole floor was loose, and a table that stood over\r\nthem concealed the circumstance from a casual observer.\r\n\r\n“I perceive,” said Oswald, “that some great discovery is at hand.”\r\n\r\n“God defend us!” said Edmund, “but I verily believe that the person that\r\nowned this armour lies buried under us.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, a dismal hollow groan was heard, as if from underneath. A\r\nsolemn silence ensued, and marks of fear were visible upon all three;\r\nthe groan was thrice heard; Oswald made signs for them to kneel, and he\r\nprayed audibly, that Heaven would direct them how to act; he also prayed\r\nfor the soul of the departed, that it might rest in peace. After this,\r\nhe arose; but Edmund continued kneeling--he vowed solemnly to devote\r\nhimself to the discovery of this secret, and the avenging the death of\r\nthe person there buried. He then rose up. “It would be to no purpose,”\r\n said he, “for us to examine further now; when I am properly authorised,\r\nI will have this place opened; I trust that time is not far off.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it,” said Oswald; “you are designed by Heaven to be its\r\ninstrument in bringing this deed of darkness to light. We are your\r\ncreatures; only tell us what you would have us do, and we are ready to\r\nobey your commands.”\r\n\r\n“I only demand your silence,” said Edmund, “till I call for your\r\nevidence; and then, you must speak all you know, and all you suspect.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Joseph, “that I may but live to see that day, and I shall\r\nhave lived long enough!”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Edmund, “let us return up stairs, and we will consult\r\nfurther how I shall proceed.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he went out of the closet, and they followed him. He locked\r\nthe door, and took the key out--“I will keep this,” said he, “till I\r\nhave power to use it to purpose, lest any one should presume to pry into\r\nthe secret of this closet. I will always carry it about me, to remind me\r\nof what I have undertaken.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, they returned up stairs into the bed-chamber; all was still,\r\nand they heard nothing more to disturb them. “How,” said Edmund, “is\r\nit possible that I should be the son of Lord Lovel? for, however\r\ncircumstances have seemed to encourage such a notion, what reason have I\r\nto believe it?”\r\n\r\n“I am strangely puzzled about it,” said Oswald. “It seems unlikely that\r\nso good a man as Lord Lovel should corrupt the wife of a peasant, his\r\nvassal; and, especially, being so lately married to a lady with whom he\r\nwas passionately in love.”\r\n\r\n“Hold there!” said Joseph; “my lord was incapable of such an action; If\r\nMaster Edmund is the son of my lord, he is also the son of my lady.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be,” said Edmund?\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how,” said Joseph; “but there is a person who can tell if\r\nshe will; I mean Margery Twyford, who calls herself your mother.”\r\n\r\n“You meet my thoughts,” said Edmund; “I had resolved, before you spoke,\r\nto visit her, and to interrogate her on the subject; I will ask my\r\nLord’s permission to go this very day.”\r\n\r\n“That is right,” said Oswald; “but be cautious and prudent in your\r\nenquiries.”\r\n\r\n“If you,” said Edmund, “would bear me company, I should do better; she\r\nmight think herself obliged to answer your questions; and, being\r\nless interested in the event, you would be more discreet in your\r\ninterrogations.”\r\n\r\n“That I will most readily,” said he; “and I will ask my lord’s\r\npermission for us both.”\r\n\r\n“This point is well determined,” said Joseph; “I am impatient for\r\nthe result; and I believe my feet will carry me to meet you whether I\r\nconsent or not.”\r\n\r\n“I am as impatient as you,” said Oswald; “but let us be silent as\r\nthe grave, and let not a word or look indicate any thing knowing or\r\nmysterious.”\r\n\r\nThe daylight began to dawn upon their conference; and Edmund, observing\r\nit, begged his friends to withdraw in silence. They did so, and left\r\nEdmund to his own recollections. His thoughts were too much employed for\r\nsleep to approach him; he threw himself upon the bed, and lay meditating\r\nhow he should proceed; a thousand schemes offered themselves and were\r\nrejected; But he resolved, at all events, to leave Baron Fitz-Owen’s\r\nfamily the first opportunity that presented itself.\r\n\r\nHe was summoned, as before, to attend my lord at breakfast; during\r\nwhich, he was silent, absent, and reserved. My Lord observed it, and\r\nrallied him; enquiring how he had spent the night?\r\n\r\n“In reflecting upon my situation, my Lord; and in laying plans for my\r\nfuture conduct.” Oswald took the hint, and asked permission to visit\r\nEdmund’s mother in his company, and acquaint her with his intentions\r\nof leaving the country soon. He consented freely; but seemed unresolved\r\nabout Edmund’s departure.\r\n\r\nThey set out directly, and Edmund went hastily to old Twyford’s cottage,\r\ndeclaring that every field seemed a mile to him. “Restrain your warmth,\r\nmy son,” said Oswald; “compose your mind, and recover your breath,\r\nbefore you enter upon a business of such consequence.” Margery met them\r\nat the door, and asked Edmund, what wind blew him thither?\r\n\r\n“Is it so very surprising,” said he, “that I should visit my parents?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” said she, “considering the treatment you have met with\r\nfrom us; but since Andrew is not in the house, I may say I am glad to\r\nsee you; Lord bless you, what a fine youth you be grown! ‘Tis a long\r\ntime since I saw you; but that is not my fault; many a cross word,\r\nand many a blow, have I had on your account; but I may now venture to\r\nembrace my dear child.”\r\n\r\nEdmund came forward and embraced her fervently; the starting tears,\r\non both sides, evinced their affection. “And why,” said he, “should\r\nmy father forbid you to embrace your child? what have I ever done to\r\ndeserve his hatred?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my dear boy! you were always good and tender-hearted, and\r\ndeserved the love of every body.”\r\n\r\n“It is not common,” said Edmund, “for a parent to hate his first-born\r\nson without his having deserved it.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said Oswald; “it is uncommon, it is unnatural; nay, I\r\nam of opinion it is almost impossible. I am so convinced of this truth,\r\nthat I believe the man who thus hates and abuses Edmund, cannot be his\r\nfather.” In saying this, he observed her countenance attentively; she\r\nchanged colour apparently. “Come,” said he, “let us sit down; and do\r\nyou, Margery, answer to what I have said.”\r\n\r\n“Blessed Virgin!” said Margery, “what does your reverence mean? what do\r\nyou suspect?”\r\n\r\n“I suspect,” said he, “that Edmund is not the son of Andrew your\r\nhusband.”\r\n\r\n“Lord bless me!” said she, “what is it you do suspect?”\r\n\r\n“Do not evade my question, woman! I am come here by authority to examine\r\nyou upon this point.”\r\n\r\nThe woman trembled every joint. “Would to Heaven!” said she, “that\r\nAndrew was at home!”\r\n\r\n“It is much better as it is,” said Oswald; “you are the person we are to\r\nexamine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, father,” said she, “do you think that I--that I--that I am to blame\r\nin this matter? what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“Do you, sir,” said he, “ask your own questions.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, Edmund threw himself at her feet, and embraced her knees.\r\n“O my mother!” said he, “for as such my heart owns you, tell me for the\r\nlove of Heaven! tell me, who was my father?”\r\n\r\n“Gracious Heaven!” said she, “what will become of me?”\r\n\r\n“Woman!” said Oswald, “confess the truth, or you shall be compelled to\r\ndo it; by whom had you this youth?”\r\n\r\n“Who, I?” said she; “I had him! No, father, I am not guilty of the black\r\ncrime of adultery; God, He knows my innocence; I am not worthy to be the\r\nmother of such a sweet youth as that is.”\r\n\r\n“You are not his mother, then, nor Andrew his father?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what shall I do?” said Margery; “Andrew will be the death of me!”\r\n\r\n“No, he shall not,” said Edmund; “you shall be protected and rewarded\r\nfor the discovery.”\r\n\r\n“Goody,” said Oswald, “confess the whole truth, and I will protect\r\nyou from harm and from blame; you may be the means of making Edmund’s\r\nfortune, in which case he will certainly provide for you; on the\r\nother hand, by an obstinate silence you will deprive yourself of all\r\nadvantages you might receive from the discovery; and, beside, you will\r\nsoon be examined in a different manner, and be obliged to confess all\r\nyou know, and nobody will thank you for it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said she, “but Andrew beat me the last time I spoke to Edmund;\r\nand told me he would break every bone in my skin, if ever I spoke to him\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“He knows it then?” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“He know it! Lord help you, it was all his own doing.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us then,” said Oswald; “for Andrew shall never know it, till it is\r\nout of his power to punish you.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a long story,” said she, “and cannot be told in a few words.”\r\n\r\n“It will never be told at this rate,” said he; “sit down and begin it\r\ninstantly.”\r\n\r\n“My fate depends upon your words,” said Edmund; “my soul is impatient\r\nof the suspense! If ever you loved me and cherished me, shew it now, and\r\ntell while I have breath to ask it.”\r\n\r\nHe sat in extreme agitation of mind; his words and actions were equally\r\nexpressive of his inward emotions.\r\n\r\n“I will,” said she; “but I must try to recollect all the circumstances.\r\nYou must know, young man, that you are just one-and-twenty years of\r\nage.”\r\n\r\n“On what day was he born,” said Oswald?\r\n\r\n“The day before yesterday,” said she, “the 21st of September.”\r\n\r\n“A remarkable era,” said he.\r\n\r\n“‘Tis so, indeed,” said Edmund; “Oh, that night! that apartment!”\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” said Oswald; “and do you, Margery, begin your story.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said she. “Just one-and-twenty years ago, on that very day, I\r\nlost my first-born son; I got a hurt by over-reaching myself, when I was\r\nnear my time, and so the poor child died. And so, as I was sitting all\r\nalone, and very melancholy, Andrew came home from work; ‘See, Margery,’\r\nsaid he, ‘I have brought you a child instead of that you have lost.’\r\nSo he gave me a bundle, as I thought; but sure enough it was a child; a\r\npoor helpless babe just born, and only rolled up in a fine handkerchief,\r\nand over that a rich velvet cloak, trimmed with gold lace. ‘And where\r\ndid you find this?’ says I. ‘Upon the foot-bridge,’ says he, ‘just below\r\nthe clayfield. This child,’ said he, ‘belongs to some great folk, and\r\nperhaps it may be enquired after one day, and may make our fortunes;\r\ntake care of it,’ said he, ‘and bring it up as if it was your own.’ The\r\npoor infant was cold, and it cried, and looked up at me so pitifully,\r\nthat I loved it; beside, my milk was troublesome to me, and I was glad\r\nto be eased of it; so I gave it the breast, and from that hour I loved\r\nthe child as if it were my own, and so I do still if I dared to own it.”\r\n\r\n“And this is all you know of Edmund’s birth?” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“No, not all,” said Margery; “but pray look out and see whether Andrew\r\nis coming, for I am all over in a twitter.”\r\n\r\n“He is not,” said Oswald; “go on, I beseech you!”\r\n\r\n“This happened,” said she, “as I told you, on the 21st. On the morrow,\r\nmy Andrew went out early to work, along with one Robin Rouse, our\r\nneighbour; they had not been gone above an hour, when they both came\r\nback seemingly very much frightened. Says Andrew, ‘Go you, Robin, and\r\nborrow a pickaxe at neighbour Styles’s.’ What is the matter now?’ said\r\nI. ‘Matter enough!’ quoth Andrew; ‘we may come to be hanged, perhaps, as\r\nmany an innocent man has before us.’ ‘Tell me what is the matter,’ said\r\nI. ‘I will,’ said he; ‘but if ever you open your mouth about it, woe be\r\nto you!’ ‘I never will,’ said I; but he made me swear by all the blessed\r\nsaints in the Calendar; and then he told me, that, as Robin and he were\r\ngoing over the foot-bridge, where he found the child the evening before,\r\nthey saw something floating upon the water; so they followed it, till it\r\nstuck against a stake, and found it to be the dead body of a woman;\r\n‘as sure as you are alive, Madge,’ said he, ‘this was the mother of the\r\nchild I brought home.’”\r\n\r\n“Merciful God!” said Edmund; “am I the child of that hapless mother?”\r\n\r\n“Be composed,” said Oswald; “proceed, good woman, the time is precious.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” continued she, “Andrew told me they dragged the body out\r\nof the river, and it was richly dressed, and must be somebody of\r\nconsequence. ‘I suppose,’ said he, ‘when the poor Lady had taken care\r\nof her child, she went to find some help; and, the night being dark, her\r\nfoot slipped, and she fell into the river, and was drowned.’\r\n\r\n“‘Lord have mercy!’ said Robin, ‘what shall we do with the dead body?\r\nwe may be taken up for the murder; what had we to do to meddle with it?’\r\n‘Ay, but,’ says Andrew, ‘we must have something to do with it now; and\r\nour wisest way is to bury it.’ Robin was sadly frightened, but at last\r\nthey agreed to carry it into the wood, and bury it there; so they came\r\nhome for a pickaxe and shovel. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘Andrew, but will you\r\nbury all the rich clothes you speak of?’ ‘Why,’ said he, ‘it would be\r\nboth a sin and a shame to strip the dead.’ ‘So it would,’ said I; ‘but\r\nI will give you a sheet to wrap the body in, and you may take off her\r\nupper garments, and any thing of value; but do not strip her to the skin\r\nfor any thing.’ ‘Well said, wench!’ said he; ‘I will do as you say.’ So\r\nI fetched a sheet, and by that time Robin was come back, and away they\r\nwent together.\r\n\r\n“They did not come back again till noon, and then they sat down and ate\r\na morsel together. Says Andrew, ‘Now we may sit down and eat in peace.’\r\n‘Aye,’ says Robin, ‘and sleep in peace too, for we have done no harm.’\r\n‘No, to be sure,’ said I; ‘but yet I am much concerned that the poor\r\nLady had not Christian burial.’ ‘Never trouble thyself about that,’ said\r\nAndrew; ‘we have done the best we could for her; but let us see what we\r\nhave got in our bags; we must divide them.’ So they opened their bags,\r\nand took out a fine gown and a pair of rich shoes; but, besides these,\r\nthere was a fine necklace with a golden locket, and a pair of earrings.\r\nSays Andrew, and winked at me, ‘I will have these, and you may take the\r\nrest.’ Robin said, he was satisfied, and so he went his way. When he was\r\ngone, ‘Here, you fool,’ says Andrew, ‘take these, and keep them as safe\r\nas the bud of your eye; If ever young master is found, these will make\r\nour fortune.’”\r\n\r\n“And have you them now?” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that I have,” answered she; “Andrew would have sold them long ago,\r\nbut I always put him off it.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven be praised!” said Edmund.\r\n\r\n“Hush,” said Oswald, “let us not lose time; proceed, Goody!”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Margery, “I have not much more to say. We looked every day\r\nto hear some enquiries after the child, but nothing passed, nobody was\r\nmissing.”\r\n\r\n“Did nobody of note die about that time?” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Why yes,” said Margery, “the widow Lady Lovel died that same week;\r\nby the same token, Andrew went to the funeral, and brought home a\r\nscutcheon, which I keep unto this day.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; go on.”\r\n\r\n“My husband behaved well enough to the boy, till such time as he had two\r\nor three children of his own; and then he began to grumble, and say, it\r\nwas hard to maintain other folks’ children, when he found it hard enough\r\nto keep his own; I loved the boy quite as well as my own; often and\r\noften have I pacified Andrew, and made him to hope that he should\r\none day or other be paid for his trouble; but at last he grew out of\r\npatience, and gave over all hopes of that kind.\r\n\r\n“As Edmund grew up, he grew sickly and tender, and could not bear hard\r\nlabour; and that was another reason why my husband could not bear with\r\nhim. ‘If,’ quoth he, ‘the boy could earn his living, I did not care;\r\nbut I must bear all the expence.[‘] There came an old pilgrim into our\r\nparts; he was a scholar, and had been a soldier, and he taught Edmund\r\nto read; then he told him histories of wars, and knights, and lords, and\r\ngreat men; and Edmund took such delight in hearing him, that he would\r\nnot take to any thing else.\r\n\r\n“To be sure, Edwin was a pleasant companion; he would tell old stories,\r\nand sing old songs, that one could have sat all night to hear him; but,\r\nas I was a saying, Edmund grew more and more fond of reading, and less\r\nof work; however, he would run of errands, and do many handy turns for\r\nthe neighbours; and he was so courteous a lad, that people took notice\r\nof him. Andrew once catched him alone reading, and then told him, that\r\nif he did not find some way to earn his bread, he would turn him out of\r\ndoors in a very short time; and so he would have done, sure enough, if\r\nmy Lord Fitz-Owen had not taken him into his service just in the nick.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Goody,” said Oswald; “you have told your story very well; I\r\nam glad, for Edmund’s sake, that you can do it so properly. But now, can\r\nyou keep a secret?”\r\n\r\n“Why, an’t please your reverence, I think I have shewed you that I can.”\r\n\r\n“But can you keep it from your husband?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said she, “surely I can; for I dare not tell it him.”\r\n\r\n“That is a good security,” said he; “but I must have a better. You must\r\nswear upon this book not to disclose any thing that has passed between\r\nus three, till we desire you to do it. Be assured you will soon be\r\ncalled upon for this purpose; Edmund’s birth is near the discovery; He\r\nis the son of parents of high degree; and it will be in his power to\r\nmake your fortune, when he takes possession of his own.”\r\n\r\n“Holy Virgin! what is it you tell me? How you rejoice me to hear, that\r\nwhat I have so long prayed for will come to pass!”\r\n\r\nShe took the oath required, saying it after Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “go and fetch the tokens you have mentioned.”\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, Edmund’s passions, long suppressed, broke out in\r\ntears and exclamations; he kneeled down, and, with his hands clasped\r\ntogether, returned thanks to Heaven for the discovery. Oswald begged\r\nhim to be composed, lest Margery should perceive his agitation,\r\nand misconstrue the cause. She soon returned with the necklace and\r\near-rings; They were pearls of great value; and the necklace had a\r\nlocket, on which the cypher of Lovel was engraved.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Oswald, “is indeed a proof of consequence. Keep it, sir,\r\nfor it belongs to you.”\r\n\r\n“Must he take it away?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” returned Oswald; “we can do nothing without it; but if\r\nAndrew should ask for it, you must put him off for the present, and\r\nhereafter he will find his account in it.”\r\n\r\nMargery consented reluctantly to part with the jewels; and, after some\r\nfurther conversation, they took leave of her.\r\n\r\nEdmund embraced her affectionately. “I thank you with my whole heart,”\r\n said he, “for all your goodness to me! Though I confess, I never felt\r\nmuch regard for your husband, yet for you I had always the tender\r\naffection of a son. You will, I trust, give your evidence in my behalf\r\nwhen called upon; and I hope it will one day be in my power to reward\r\nyour kindness; In that case, I will own you as my foster-mother, and you\r\nshall always be treated as such.”\r\n\r\nMargery wept. “The Lord grant it!” said she; “and I pray him to have you\r\nin his holy keeping. Farewell, my dear child!”\r\n\r\nOswald desired them to separate for fear of intrusion; and they returned\r\nto the castle. Margery stood at the door of her cottage, looking every\r\nway to see if the coast was clear.\r\n\r\n“Now, Sir,” said Oswald, “I congratulate you as the son of Lord and Lady\r\nLovel; the proofs are strong and indisputable.”\r\n\r\n“To us they are so,” said Edmund; “but how shall we make them so to\r\nothers? and what are we to think of the funeral of Lady Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“As of a fiction,” said Oswald; “the work of the present lord, to secure\r\nhis title and fortune.”\r\n\r\n“And what means can we use to dispossess him?” said Edmund; “He is not a\r\nman for a poor youth like me to contend with.”\r\n\r\n“Doubt not,” said Oswald, “but Heaven, who has evidently conducted you\r\nby the hand thus far, will complete its own work; for my part, I can\r\nonly wonder and adore!”\r\n\r\n“Give me your advice then,” said Edmund; “for Heaven assists us by\r\nnatural means.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Oswald, “that your first step must be to make a\r\nfriend of some great man, of consequence enough to espouse your cause,\r\nand to get this affair examined into by authority.”\r\n\r\nEdmund started, and crossed himself; he suddenly exclaimed, “A friend!\r\nYes; I have a friend! a powerful one too; one sent by Heaven to be my\r\nprotector, but whom I have too long neglected.”\r\n\r\n“Who can that be?” said Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Who should it be,” said Edmund, “but that good Sir Philip Harclay, the\r\nchosen friend of him, whom I shall from henceforward call my father.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true indeed,” said Oswald; “and this is a fresh proof of what\r\nI before observed, that Heaven assists you, and will complete its own\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“I think so myself,” said Edmund, “and rely upon its direction. I have\r\nalready determined on my future conduct, which I will communicate to\r\nyou. My first step shall be to leave the castle; my lord has this day\r\ngiven me a horse, upon which I purpose to set out this very night,\r\nwithout the knowledge of any of the family. I will go to Sir Philip\r\nHarclay; I will throw myself at his feet, relate my strange story, and\r\nimplore his protection; With him I will consult on the most proper way\r\nof bringing this murderer to public justice; and I will be guided by his\r\nadvice and direction in everything.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be better,” said Oswald, “than what you propose; but give\r\nme leave to offer an addition to your scheme. You shall set off in the\r\ndead of night, as you intend; Joseph and I, will favour your departure\r\nin such a manner as to throw a mystery over the circumstances of it.\r\nYour disappearing at such a time from the haunted apartment will terrify\r\nand confound all the family; they will puzzle themselves in vain to\r\naccount for it, and they will be afraid to pry into the secrets of that\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“You say well, and I approve your addition,” replied Edmund. “Suppose,\r\nlikewise, there was a letter written in a mysterious manner, and dropt\r\nin my lord’s way, or sent to him afterwards; it would forward our\r\ndesign, and frighten them away from that apartment.” “That shall be\r\nmy care,” said Oswald; “and I will warrant you that they will not find\r\nthemselves disposed to inhabit it presently.”\r\n\r\n“But how shall I leave my dear friend Mr. William, without a word of\r\nnotice of this separation?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought of that too,” said Oswald; “and I will so manage, as\r\nto acquaint him with it in such a manner as he shall think out of the\r\ncommon course of things, and which shall make him wonder and be silent.”\r\n\r\n“How will you do that,” said Edmund?\r\n\r\n“I will tell you hereafter,” said Oswald; “for here comes old Joseph to\r\nmeet us.”\r\n\r\nHe came, indeed, as fast as his age would permit him. As soon as he\r\nwas within hearing, he asked them what news? They related all that had\r\npassed at Twyford’s cottage; he heard them with the greatest eagerness\r\nof attention, and as soon as they came to the great event, “I knew it! I\r\nknew it!” exclaimed Joseph; “I was sure it would prove so! Thank God\r\nfor it! But I will be the first to acknowledge my young lord, and I will\r\nlive and die his faithful servant!” Here Joseph attempted to kneel to\r\nhim, but Edmund prevented him with a warm embrace.\r\n\r\n“My friend! my dear friend!” said he, “I cannot suffer a man of your age\r\nto kneel to me; are you not one of my best and truest friends? I\r\nwill ever remember your disinterested affection for me; and if heaven\r\nrestores me to my rights, it shall be one of my first cares to render\r\nyour old age easy and happy.” Joseph wept over him, and it was some time\r\nbefore he could utter a word.\r\n\r\nOswald gave them both time to recover their emotion, by acquainting\r\nJoseph with Edmund’s scheme for his departure. Joseph wiped his eyes and\r\nspoke. “I have thought,” said he, “of something that will be both agree\r\n and useful to my dear master. John Wyatt, Sir Philip Harclay’s servant,\r\nis now upon a visit at his father’s; I have heard that he goes home\r\nsoon; now he would be both a guide and companion, on the way.”\r\n\r\n“That is, indeed, a happy circumstance,” said Edmund; “but how shall we\r\nknow certainly the time of his departure?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Sir, I will go to him, and enquire; and bring you word directly.”\r\n\r\n“Do so,” said Edmund, “and you will oblige me greatly.”\r\n\r\n“But, Sir,” said Oswald, “I think it will be best not to let John\r\nWyatt know who is to be his companion; only let Joseph tell him that a\r\ngentleman is going to visit his master, and, if possible, prevail upon\r\nhim to set out this night.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, my good friend,” said Edmund; “and tell him, further, that this\r\nperson has business of great consequence to communicate to his master,\r\nand cannot delay his journey on any account.”\r\n\r\n“I will do this, you may depend,” said Joseph, “and acquaint you with my\r\nsuccess as soon as possible; but, sir, you must not go without a guide,\r\nat any rate.”\r\n\r\n“I trust I shall not,” said Edmund, “though I go alone; he that has\r\nreceived such a call as I have, can want no other, nor fear any danger.”\r\n\r\nThey conversed on these points till they drew near the castle, when\r\nJoseph left them to go on his errand, and Edmund attended his Lord\r\nat dinner. The Baron observed that he was silent and reserved; the\r\nconversation languished on both sides. As soon as dinner was ended,\r\nEdmund asked permission to go up into his own apartment; where he packed\r\nup some necessaries, and made a hasty preparation for his departure.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he walked into the garden, revolving in his mind the\r\npeculiarity of his situation, and the uncertainty of his future\r\nprospects; lost in thought, he walked to and fro in a covered walk, with\r\nhis arms crossed and his eyes cast down, without perceiving that he was\r\nobserved by two females who stood at a distance watching his motions. It\r\nwas the Lady Emma, and her attendant, who were thus engaged. At length,\r\nhe lifted up his eyes and saw them; he stood still, and was irresolute\r\nwhether to advance or retire. They approached him; and, as they drew\r\nnear, fair Emma spoke.\r\n\r\n“You have been so wrapt in meditation, Edmund, that I am apprehensive of\r\nsome new vexation that I am yet a stranger to. Would it were in my power\r\nto lessen those you have already! But tell me if I guess truly?”\r\n\r\nHe stood still irresolute, he answered with hesitation. “O, lady--I\r\nam--I am grieved, I am concerned, to be the cause of so much confusion\r\nin this noble family, to which I am so much indebted; I see no way to\r\nlessen these evils but to remove the cause of them.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning yourself?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Madam; and I was meditating on my departure.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said she, “by your departure you will not remove the cause.”\r\n\r\n“How so, madam?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are not the cause, but those you will leave behind you.”\r\n\r\n“Lady Emma!”\r\n\r\n“How can you affect this ignorance, Edmund? You know well enough it is\r\nthat odious Wenlock, your enemy and my aversion, that has caused all\r\nthis mischief among us, and will much more, if he is not removed.”\r\n\r\n“This, madam, is a subject that it becomes me to be silent upon. Mr.\r\nWenlock is your kinsman; he is not my friend; and for that reason I\r\nought not to speak against him, nor you to hear it from me. If he has\r\nused me ill, I am recompensed by the generous treatment of my lord your\r\nfather, who is all that is great and good; he has allowed me to justify\r\nmyself to him, and he has restored me to his good opinion, which I prize\r\namong the best gifts of heaven. Your amiable brother William thinks well\r\nof me, and his esteem is infinitely dear to me; and you, excellent Lady,\r\npermit me to hope that you honour me with your good opinion. Are not\r\nthese ample amends for the ill-will Mr. Wenlock bears me?”\r\n\r\n“My opinion of you, Edmund,” said she, “is fixed and settled. It is\r\nnot founded upon events of yesterday, but upon long knowledge and\r\nexperience; upon your whole conduct and character.”\r\n\r\n“You honour me, lady! Continue to think well of me, it will excite me\r\nto deserve it. When I am far distant from this place, the remembrance of\r\nyour goodness will be a cordial to my heart.”\r\n\r\n“But why will you leave us, Edmund? Stay and defeat the designs of your\r\nenemy; you shall have my wishes and assistance.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Madam, that is among the things I cannot do, even if it were\r\nin my power, which it is not. Mr. Wenlock loves you, lady, and if he is\r\nso unhappy as to be your aversion, that is a punishment severe enough.\r\nFor the rest, I may be unfortunate by the wickedness of others, but if I\r\nam unworthy, it must be by my own fault.”\r\n\r\n“So then you think it is an unworthy action to oppose Mr. Wenlock! Very\r\nwell, sir. Then I suppose you wish him success; you wish that I may be\r\nmarried to him?”\r\n\r\n“I, Madam!” said Edmund, confused; “what am I that I should give my\r\nopinion on an affair of so much consequence? You distress me by the\r\nquestion. May you be happy! may you enjoy your own wishes!”\r\n\r\nHe sighed, he turned away. She called him back; he trembled, and kept\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to enjoy his confusion; she was cruel enough to repeat the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Edmund, and truly, do you wish to see me give my hand to\r\nWenlock? I insist upon your answer.”\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden he recovered both his voice and courage; he stepped\r\nforward, his person erect, his countenance assured, his voice resolute\r\nand intrepid.\r\n\r\n“Since Lady Emma insists upon my answer, since she avows a dislike to\r\nWenlock, since she condescends to ask my opinion, I will tell her my\r\nthoughts, my wishes.”\r\n\r\nThe fair Emma now trembled in her turn; she blushed, looked down, and\r\nwas ashamed to have spoken so freely.\r\n\r\nEdmund went on. “My most ardent wishes are, that the fair Emma may\r\nreserve her heart and hand till a certain person, a friend of mine, is\r\nat liberty to solicit them; whose utmost ambition is, first to deserve,\r\nand then to obtain them.”\r\n\r\n“Your friend, Sir!” said Lady Emma! her brow clouded, her eye\r\ndisdainful.\r\n\r\nEdmund proceeded. “My friend is so particularly circumstanced that he\r\ncannot at present with propriety ask for Lady Emma’s favour; but as soon\r\nas he has gained a cause that is yet in suspence, he will openly declare\r\nhis pretensions, and if he is unsuccessful, he will then condemn himself\r\nto eternal silence.”\r\n\r\n Lady Emma knew not what to think of this declaration; she hoped, she\r\nfeared, she meditated; but her attention was too strongly excited to\r\nbe satisfied without some gratification; After a pause, she pursued the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“And this friend of yours, sir, of what degree and fortune is he?”\r\n\r\nEdmund smiled; but, commanding his emotion, he replied, “His birth is\r\nnoble, his degree and fortune uncertain.”\r\n\r\nHer countenance fell, she sighed; he proceeded. “It is utterly\r\nimpossible,” said he, “for any man of inferior degree to aspire to Lady\r\nEmma’s favour; her noble birth, the dignity of her beauty and virtues,\r\nmust awe and keep at their proper distance, all men of inferior degree\r\nand merit; they may admire, they may revere; but they must not presume\r\nto approach too near, lest their presumption should meet with its\r\npunishment.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said she, suddenly; “and so this friend of yours has\r\ncommissioned you to speak in his behalf?”\r\n\r\n“He has, Madam.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must tell you, that I think his assurance is very great, and\r\nyours not much less.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for that, Madam.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him, that I shall reserve my heart and hand for the man to whom my\r\nfather shall bid me give them.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Lady; I am certain my lord loves you too well to dispose of\r\nthem against your inclination.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that, sir? But tell him, that the man that hopes for my\r\nfavour must apply to my lord for his.”\r\n\r\n“That is my friend’s intention--his resolution, I should say--as soon as\r\nhe can do it with propriety; and I accept your permission for him to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“My permission did you say? I am astonished at your assurance! tell me\r\nno more of your friend; But perhaps you are pleading for Wenlock all\r\nthis time; It is all one to me; only, say no more.”\r\n\r\n“Are you offended with me, madam?”\r\n\r\n“No matter, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is.”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised at you, Edmund.”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised at my own temerity; but, forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“It does not signify; good bye ty’e, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave me in anger, madam; I cannot bear that. Perhaps I may not\r\nsee you again for a long time.”\r\n\r\n He looked afflicted; she turned back.  “I do forgive you, Edmund; I\r\nwas concerned for you; but, it seems, you are more concerned for every\r\nbody than for yourself.” She sighed; “Farewell!” said she.\r\n\r\nEdmund gazed on her with tenderness; he approached her, he just touched\r\nher hand; his heart was rising to his lips, but he recollected his\r\nsituation; he checked himself immediately; he retired back, he sighed\r\ndeeply, bowed low, and hastily quitted her.\r\n\r\nThe lady turning into another walk, he reached the house first, and went\r\nup again to his chamber; he threw himself upon his knees; prayed for a\r\nthousand blessings upon every one of the family of his benefactor, and\r\ninvoluntarily wept at mentioning the name of the charming Emma, whom he\r\nwas about to leave abruptly, and perhaps for ever. He then endeavoured\r\nto compose himself, and once more attended the Baron; wished him a good\r\nnight; and withdrew to his chamber, till he was called upon to go again\r\nto the haunted apartment.\r\n\r\nHe came down equipped for his journey, and went hastily for fear of\r\nobservation; he paid his customary devotions, and soon after Oswald\r\ntapped at the door. They conferred together upon the interesting subject\r\nthat engrossed their attention, until Joseph came to them, who brought\r\nthe rest of Edmund’s baggage, and some refreshment for him before he\r\nset out. Edmund promised to give them the earliest information of his\r\nsituation and success. At the hour of twelve they heard the same\r\ngroans as the night before in the lower apartment; but, being somewhat\r\nfamiliarized to it, they were not so strongly affected. Oswald crossed\r\nhimself, and prayed for the departed soul; he also prayed for Edmund,\r\nand recommended him to the Divine protection. He then arose, and\r\nembraced that young man; who, also, took a tender leave of his friend\r\nJoseph. They then went, with silence and caution, through a long\r\ngallery; they descended the stairs in the same manner; they crossed the\r\nhall in profound silence, and hardly dared to breathe, lest they should\r\nbe overheard; they found some difficulty in opening one of the folding\r\ndoors, which at last they accomplished; they were again in jeopardy at\r\nthe outward gate. At length they conveyed him safely into the stables;\r\nthere they again embraced him, and prayed for his prosperity.\r\n\r\nHe then mounted his horse, and set forward to Wyatt’s cottage; he\r\nhallooed at the door, and was answered from within. In a few minutes\r\nJohn came out to him.\r\n\r\n“What, is it you, Master Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said he; “not a word of who I am; I go upon private business,\r\nand would not wish to be known.”\r\n\r\n“If you will go forward, sir, I will soon overtake you.” He did so; and\r\nthey pursued their journey to the north. In the mean time, Oswald\r\nand Joseph returned in silence into the house; they retired to their\r\nrespective apartments without hearing or being heard by any one.\r\n\r\nAbout the dawn of day Oswald intended to lay his packets in the way of\r\nthose to whom they were addressed; after much contrivance he determined\r\nto take a bold step, and, if he were discovered, to frame some excuse.\r\nEncouraged by his late success, he went on tip-toe into Master William’s\r\nchamber, placed a letter upon his pillow, and withdrew unheard. Exulting\r\nin his heart, he attempted the Baron’s apartment, but found it fastened\r\nwithin. Finding this scheme frustrated, he waited till the hour the\r\nBaron was expected down to breakfast, and laid the letter and the key of\r\nthe haunted apartment upon the table. Soon after, he saw the Baron\r\nenter the breakfast room; he got out of sight, but staid within call,\r\npreparing himself for a summons. The Baron sat down to breakfast; he saw\r\na letter directed to himself--he opened it, and to his great surprise,\r\nread as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The guardian of the haunted apartment to Baron Fitz-Owen. To thee I\r\nremit the key of my charge, until the right owner shall come, who will\r\nboth discover and avenge my wrongs; then, woe be to the guilty!--But\r\nlet the innocent rest in peace. In the mean time, let none presume\r\nto explore the secrets of my apartment, lest they suffer for their\r\ntemerity.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron was struck with amazement at the letter. He took up the key,\r\nexamined it, then laid it down, and took up the letter; he was in such\r\nconfusion of thought, he knew not what to do or say for several minutes.\r\nAt length he called his servants about him; the first question he asked\r\nwas--\r\n\r\n“Where is Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“They could not tell.\r\n\r\n“Has he been called?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lord, but nobody answered, and the key was not in the door.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Joseph?”\r\n\r\n“Gone into the stables.”\r\n\r\n“Where is father Oswald?”\r\n\r\n“In his study.”\r\n\r\n“Seek him, and desire him to come hither.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the Baron had read the letter over again, he came.\r\n\r\nHe had been framing a steady countenance to answer to all\r\ninterrogatories. As he came in he attentively observed the Baron, whose\r\nfeatures were in strong agitation; as soon as he saw Oswald, he spoke as\r\none out of breath.\r\n\r\n“Take that key, and read this letter!”\r\n\r\nHe did so, shrugged up his shoulders, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said my lord, “what think you of this letter?”\r\n\r\n“It is a very surprising one.”\r\n\r\n“The contents are alarming. Where is Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Has nobody seen him?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Call my sons, my kinsmen, my servants.”\r\n\r\nThe servants came in.\r\n\r\n“Have any of you seen or heard of Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“No,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Father, step upstairs to my sons and kinsmen, and desire them to come\r\ndown immediately.”\r\n\r\nOswald withdrew; and went, first, to Mr. William’s chamber.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, you must come to my lord now directly--he has something\r\nextraordinary to communicate to you.”\r\n\r\n“And so have I, father--see what I have found upon my pillow!”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir, read it to me before you shew it to any body; my lord\r\nis alarmed too much already, and wants nothing to increase his\r\nconsternation.”\r\n\r\nWilliam read his letter, while Oswald looked as if he was an utter\r\nstranger to the contents, which were these:--\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be heard or seen, let the seal of friendship be upon thy\r\nlips. The peasant Edmund is no more; but there still lives a man who\r\nhopes to acknowledge, and repay, the Lord Fitz-Owen’s generous care\r\nand protection; to return his beloved William’s vowed affection, and to\r\nclaim his friendship on terms of equality.”\r\n\r\n“What,” said William, “can this mean?”\r\n\r\n“It is not easy to say,” replied Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell what is the cause of this alarm?”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you nothing, but that my lord desires to see you\r\ndirectly--pray make haste down; I must go up to your brothers and\r\nkinsmen, nobody knows what to think, or believe.”\r\n\r\nMaster William went down stairs, and Father Oswald went to the\r\nmalcontents. As soon as he entered the outward door of their apartment,\r\nMr. Wenlock called out. “Here comes the friend--now for some new\r\nproposal!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Oswald, “my lord desires your company immediately in\r\nthe breakfast parlour.”\r\n\r\n“What! to meet your favourite Edmund, I suppose?” said Mr. Wenlock.\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, is the matter?” said Sir Robert.\r\n\r\n“Something very extraordinary has happened, gentlemen. Edmund is not to\r\nbe found--he disappeared from the haunted apartment, the key of which\r\nwas conveyed to my lord in a strange manner, with a letter from an\r\nunknown hand; my lord is both surprised and concerned, and wishes to\r\nhave your opinion and advice on the occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him,” said Sir Robert, “we will wait upon him immediately.”\r\n\r\nAs Oswald went away, he heard Wenlock say, “So Edmund is gone, it is no\r\nmatter how, or whither.”\r\n\r\nAnother said, “I hope the ghost has taken him out of the way.” The rest\r\nlaughed at the conceit, as they followed Oswald down stairs. They found\r\nthe Baron, and his son William, commenting upon the key and the letter.\r\nMy lord gave them to Sir Robert, who looked on them with marks of\r\nsurprise and confusion.\r\n\r\nThe Baron addressed him--\r\n\r\n“Is not this a very strange affair? Son Robert, lay aside your ill\r\nhumours, and behave to your father with the respect and affection his\r\ntenderness deserves from you, and give me your advice and opinion on\r\nthis alarming subject.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said Sir Robert, “I am as much confounded as yourself--I\r\ncan give no advice--let my cousins see the letter--let us have their\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\nThey read it in turn--they were equally surprised; but when it came into\r\nWenlock’s hand, he paused and meditated some minutes.\r\n\r\nAt length--“I am indeed surprised, and still more concerned, to see my\r\nlord and uncle the dupe of an artful contrivance; and, if he will permit\r\nme, I shall endeavour to unriddle it, to the confusion of all that are\r\nconcerned in it.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, Dick,” said my lord, “and you shall have my thanks for it.”\r\n\r\n“This letter,” said he, “I imagine to be the contrivance of Edmund, or\r\nsome ingenious friend of his, to conceal some designs they have against\r\nthe peace of this family, which has been too often disturbed upon that\r\nrascal’s account.”\r\n\r\n“But what end could be proposed by it?” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“Why, one part of the scheme is to cover Edmund’s departure, that is\r\nclear enough; for the rest, we can only guess at it--perhaps he may be\r\nconcealed somewhere in that apartment, from whence he may rush out in\r\nthe night, and either rob or murder us; or, at least, alarm and terrify\r\nthe family.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron smiled.\r\n\r\n“You shoot beyond the mark, sir, and overshoot yourself, as you have\r\ndone before now; you shew only your inveteracy against that poor lad,\r\nwhom you cannot mention with temper. To what purpose should he shut\r\nhimself up there, to be starved?”\r\n\r\n“Starved! no, no! he has friends in this house (looking at Oswald), who\r\nwill not suffer him to want anything; those who have always magnified\r\nhis virtues, and extenuated his faults, will lend a hand to help him in\r\ntime of need; and, perhaps, to assist his ingenious contrivances.”\r\n\r\nOswald shrugged up his shoulders, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n“This is a strange fancy of yours, Dick,” said my lord; “but I am willing\r\nto pursue it,--first, to discover what you drive at; and, secondly, to\r\nsatisfy all that are here present of the truth or falsehood of it, that\r\nthey may know what value to set upon your sagacity hereafter. Let us all\r\ngo over that apartment together; and let Joseph be called to attend us\r\nthither.”\r\n\r\nOswald offered to call him, but Wenlock stopped him. “No, father,” said\r\nhe, “you must stay with us; we want your ghostly counsel and advice;\r\nJoseph shall have no private conference with you.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you,” said Oswald, “to insinuate to my lord against me or\r\nJoseph? But your ill-will spares nobody. It will one day be known who is\r\nthe disturber of the peace of this family; I wait for that time, and am\r\nsilent.”\r\n\r\nJoseph came; when he was told whither they were going, he looked hard at\r\nOswald. Wenlock observed them.\r\n\r\n“Lead the way, father,” said he, “and Joseph shall follow us.”\r\n\r\nOswald smiled.\r\n\r\n“We will go where Heaven permits us,” said he; “alas! the wisdom of man\r\ncan neither hasten, nor retard, its decrees.”\r\n\r\nThey followed the father up stairs, and went directly to the haunted\r\napartment. The Baron unlocked the door; he bid Joseph open the shutters,\r\nand admit the daylight, which had been excluded for many years. They\r\nwent over the rooms above stairs, and then descended the staircase, and\r\nthrough the lower rooms in the same manner. However, they overlooked the\r\ncloset, in which the fatal secret was concealed; the door was covered\r\nwith tapestry, the same as the room, and united so well that it seemed\r\nbut one piece. Wenlock tauntingly desired Father Oswald to introduce\r\nthem to the ghost. The father, in reply, asked them where they should\r\nfind Edmund. “Do you think,” said he, “that he lies hid in my pocket, or\r\nin Joseph’s?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis no matter,” answered he; “thoughts are free.”\r\n\r\n“My opinion of you, Sir,” said Oswald, “is not founded upon thoughts--I\r\njudge of men by their actions,--a rule, I believe, it will not suit you\r\nto be tried by.”\r\n\r\n“None of your insolent admonitions, father!” returned Wenlock; “this is\r\nneither the time nor the place for them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is truer than you are aware of, sir; I meant not to enter into the\r\nsubject just now.”\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” said my Lord.\r\n\r\n“I shall enter into this subject with you hereafter--then look you be\r\nprepared for it. In the mean time, do you, Dick Wenlock, answer to my\r\nquestions:--Do you think Edmund is concealed in this apartment?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think there is any mystery in it?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Is it haunted, think you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I think not.”\r\n\r\n“Should you be afraid to try?”\r\n\r\n“In what manner, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you have shewn your wit upon the subject, and I mean to show your\r\ncourage;--you, and Jack Markham your confident, shall sleep here three\r\nnights, as Edmund has done before.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Sir Robert, “for what purpose? I should be glad to\r\nunderstand why.”\r\n\r\n“I have my reasons, sir, as well as your kinsmen there. No reply, Sirs!\r\nI insist upon being obeyed in this point. Joseph, let the beds be well\r\naired, and every thing made agreeable to the gentlemen; If there is any\r\ncontrivance to impose upon me, they, I am sure, will have pleasure in\r\ndetecting it; and, if not, I shall obtain my end in making these rooms\r\nhabitable. Oswald, come with me; and the rest may go where they list\r\ntill dinner-time.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron went with Oswald into the parlour.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me, father,” said he, “do you disapprove what I have done?”\r\n\r\n“Quite the contrary, my lord,” said he; “I entirely approve it.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not know all my reasons for it. Yesterday Edmund’s behaviour\r\nwas different from what I have ever seen it--he is naturally frank and\r\nopen in all his ways; but he was then silent, thoughtful, absent; he\r\nsighed deeply, and once I saw tears stand in his eyes. Now, I do\r\nsuspect there is something uncommon in that apartment--that Edmund has\r\ndiscovered the secret; and, fearing to disclose it, he is fled away from\r\nthe house. As to this letter, perhaps he may have written it to\r\nhint that there is more than he dares reveal; I tremble at the hints\r\ncontained in it, though I shall appear to make light of it. But I and\r\nmine are innocent; and if Heaven discloses the guilt of others, I ought\r\nto adore and submit to its decrees.”\r\n\r\n“That is prudently and piously resolved, my lord; let us do our duty,\r\nand leave events to Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“But, father, I have a further view in obliging my kinsmen to sleep\r\nthere:--if any thing should appear to them, it is better that it should\r\nonly be known to my own family; if there is nothing in it, I shall put\r\nto the proof the courage and veracity of my two kinsmen, of whom I think\r\nvery indifferently. I mean shortly to enquire into many things I have\r\nheard lately to their disadvantage; and, if I find them guilty, they\r\nshall not escape with impunity.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Oswald, “you judge like yourself; I wish you to make\r\nenquiry concerning them, and believe the result will be to their\r\nconfusion, and your Lordship will be enabled to re-establish the peace\r\nof your family.”\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, Oswald was upon his guard, lest any thing\r\nshould escape that might create suspicion. He withdrew as soon as he\r\ncould with decency, and left the Baron meditating what all these things\r\nshould mean; he feared there was some misfortune impending over his\r\nhouse, though he knew not from what cause.\r\n\r\nHe dined with his children and kinsmen, and strove to appear cheerful;\r\nbut a gloom was perceivable through his deportment. Sir Robert was\r\nreserved and respectful; Mr. William was silent and attentive; the rest\r\nof the family dutifully assiduous to my Lord; only Wenlock and Markham\r\nwere sullen and chagrined. The Baron detained the young men the whole\r\nafternoon; he strove to amuse and to be amused; he shewed the greatest\r\naffection and parental regard to his children, and endeavoured to\r\nconciliate their affections, and engage their gratitude by kindness.\r\nWenlock and Markham felt their courage abate as the night approached;\r\nAt the hour of nine, old Joseph came to conduct them to the haunted\r\napartment; they took leave of their kinsmen, and went up stairs with\r\nheavy hearts.\r\n\r\nThey found the chamber set in order for them, and a table spread with\r\nprovision and good liquor to keep up their spirits.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” said Wenlock, “that your friend Edmund was obliged to you\r\nfor his accommodations here.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Joseph, “his accommodations were bad enough the first night;\r\nbut, afterwards, they were bettered by my lord’s orders.”\r\n\r\n“Owing to your officious cares?” said Wenlock.\r\n\r\n“I own it,” said Joseph, “and I am not ashamed of it.”\r\n\r\n“Are you not anxious to know what is become of him?” said Markham.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir; I trust he is in the best protection; so good a young\r\nman as he is, is safe everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“You see, cousin Jack,” said Wenlock, “how this villain has stole the\r\nhearts of my uncle’s servants; I suppose this canting old fellow knows\r\nwhere he is, if the truth were known.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any further commands for me, gentlemen?” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“No, not we.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am ordered to attend my lord, when you have done with me.”\r\n\r\n“Go, then, about your business.”\r\n\r\nJoseph went away, glad to be dismissed.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do, cousin Jack,” said Wenlock, “to pass away the\r\ntime?--it is plaguy dull sitting here.”\r\n\r\n“Dull enough,” said Markham, “I think the best thing we can do, is to go\r\nto bed and sleep it away.”\r\n\r\n“Faith!” says Wenlock, “I am in no disposition to sleep. Who would have\r\nthought the old man would have obliged us to spend the night here?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say us, I beg of you; it was all your own doing,” replied\r\nMarkham.\r\n\r\n“I did not intend he should have taken me at my word.”\r\n\r\n“Then you should have spoken more cautiously. I have always been\r\ngoverned by you, like a fool as I am; you play the braggart, and I\r\nsuffer for it; But they begin to see through your fine-spun arts and\r\ncontrivances, and I believe you will meet with your deserts one day or\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“What now? do you mean to affront me, Jack? Know, that some are born\r\nto plan, others to execute; I am one of the former, thou of the latter.\r\nKnow your friend, or--”\r\n\r\n“Or what?” replied Markham; “do you mean to threaten me? If you do!”\r\n\r\n“What then?” said Wenlock.\r\n\r\n“Why, then, I will try which of us two is the best man, sir!”\r\n\r\nUpon this Markham arose, and put himself into a posture of defence.\r\nWenlock perceiving he was serious in his anger, began to soothe him;\r\nhe persuaded, he flattered, he promised great things if he would be\r\ncomposed. Markham was sullen, uneasy, resentful; whenever he spoke, it\r\nwas to upbraid Wenlock with his treachery and falsehood. Wenlock\r\ntried all his eloquence to get him into a good humour, but in vain; he\r\nthreatened to acquaint his uncle with all that he knew, and to exculpate\r\nhimself at the other’s expence. Wenlock began to find his choler rise;\r\nthey were both almost choaked with rage; and, at length, they both rose\r\nwith a resolution to fight.\r\n\r\nAs they stood with their fists clenched, on a sudden they were alarmed\r\nwith a dismal groan from the room underneath. They stood like statues\r\npetrified by fear, yet listening with trembling expectation. A second\r\ngroan increased their consternation; and, soon after, a third completed\r\nit. They staggered to a seat, and sunk down upon it, ready to faint.\r\nPresently, all the doors flew open, a pale glimmering light appeared at\r\nthe door, from the staircase, and a man in complete armour entered the\r\nroom. He stood, with one hand extended, pointing to the outward door;\r\nthey took the hint, and crawled away as fast as fear would let them;\r\nthey staggered along the gallery, and from thence to the Baron’s\r\napartment, where Wenlock sunk down in a swoon, and Markham had just\r\nstrength enough to knock at the door.\r\n\r\nThe servant who slept in the outward room alarmed his lord.\r\n\r\nMarkham cried out, “For Heaven’s sake, let us in!”\r\n\r\nUpon hearing his voice, the door was opened, and Markham approached\r\nhis Uncle in such an attitude of fear, as excited a degree of it in the\r\nBaron. He pointed to Wenlock, who was with some difficulty recovered\r\nfrom the fit he was fallen into; the servant was terrified, he rung the\r\nalarm-bell; the servants came running from all parts to their Lord’s\r\napartment; The young gentlemen came likewise, and presently all was\r\nconfusion, and the terror was universal. Oswald, who guessed the\r\nbusiness, was the only one that could question them. He asked several\r\ntimes,\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nMarkham, at last, answered him, “We have seen the ghost!”\r\n\r\nAll regard to secrecy was now at an end; the echo ran through the whole\r\nfamily--“They have seen the ghost!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron desired Oswald to talk to the young men, and endeavour to\r\nquiet the disturbance. He came forward; he comforted some, he rebuked\r\nothers; he had the servants retire into the outward room. The Baron,\r\nwith his sons and kinsmen, remained in the bed-chamber.\r\n\r\n“It is very unfortunate,” said Oswald, “that this affair should be made\r\nso public; surely these young men might have related what they had seen,\r\nwithout alarming the whole family. I am very much concerned upon my\r\nlord’s account.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, father,” said the Baron; “but prudence was quite\r\noverthrown here. Wenlock was half dead, and Markham half distracted; the\r\nfamily were alarmed without my being able to prevent it. But let us hear\r\nwhat these poor terrified creatures say.”\r\n\r\nOswald demanded, “What have you seen, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“The ghost!” said Markham.\r\n\r\n“In what form did it appear?”\r\n\r\n“A man in armour.”\r\n\r\n“Did it speak to you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What did it do to terrify you so much?”\r\n\r\n“It stood at the farthest door, and pointed to the outward door, as if\r\nto have us leave the room; we did not wait for a second notice, but came\r\naway as fast as we could.”\r\n\r\n“Did it follow you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then you need not have raised such a disturbance.”\r\n\r\nWenlock lifted up his head, and spoke--\r\n\r\n“I believe, father, if you had been with us, you would not have stood\r\nupon ceremonies any more than we did. I wish my lord would send you to\r\nparley with the ghost; for, without doubt, you are better qualified than\r\nwe.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said Oswald, “I will go thither, with your permission; I will\r\nsee that every thing is safe, and bring the key back to you; Perhaps\r\nthis may help to dispel the fears that have been raised--at least, I\r\nwill try to do it.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, father, for your good offices--do as you please.”\r\n\r\nOswald went into the outward room. “I am going,” said he, “to shut up\r\nthe apartment. The young gentlemen have been more frightened than they\r\nhad occasion for; I will try to account for it. Which of you will go\r\nwith me?”\r\n\r\nThey all drew back, except Joseph, who offered to bear him company. They\r\nwent into the bedroom in the haunted apartment, and found every thing\r\nquiet there. They put out the fire, extinguished the lights, locked\r\nthe door, and brought away the key. As they returned, “I thought how it\r\nwould be,” said Joseph.\r\n\r\n“Hush! not a word,” said Oswald; “you find we are suspected of\r\nsomething, though they know not what. Wait till you are called upon, and\r\nthen we will both speak to purpose.” They carried the key to the Baron.\r\n\r\n“All is quiet in the apartment,” said Oswald, “as we can testify.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ask Joseph to go with you,” said the Baron, “or did he offer\r\nhimself?”\r\n\r\n“My Lord, I asked if any body would go with me, and they all declined it\r\nbut he; I thought proper to have a witness beside myself, for whatever\r\nmight be seen or heard.”\r\n\r\n“Joseph, you were servant to the late Lord Lovel; what kind of man was\r\nhe?”\r\n\r\n“A very comely man, please your lordship.”\r\n\r\n“Should you know him if you were to see him?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Would you have any objection to sleep a night in that apartment?”\r\n\r\n“I beg,”--“I hope,”--“I beseech your lordship not to command me to\r\ndo it!”\r\n\r\n“You are then afraid; why did you offer yourself to go thither?”\r\n\r\n“Because I was not so much frightened as the rest.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would lie a night there; but I do not insist upon it.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am a poor ignorant old man, not fit for such an undertaking;\r\nbeside, if I should see the ghost, and if it should be the person of my\r\nmaster, and if it should tell me any thing, and bid me keep it secret, I\r\nshould not dare to disclose it; and then, what service should I do your\r\nlordship?”\r\n\r\n“That is true, indeed,” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“This speech,” said Sir Robert, “is both a simple and an artful one. You\r\nsee, however, that Joseph is not a man for us to depend upon; he regards\r\nthe Lord Lovel, though dead, more than Lord Fitz-Owen, living; he calls\r\nhim his master, and promises to keep his secrets. What say you, father,\r\nIs the ghost your master, or your friend? Are you under any obligation\r\nto keep his secrets?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Oswald, “I answer as Joseph does; I would sooner die than\r\ndiscover a secret revealed in that manner.”\r\n\r\n“I thought as much,” said Sir Robert; “there is a mystery in Father\r\nOswald’s behaviour, that I cannot comprehend.”\r\n\r\n“Do not reflect upon the father,” said the Baron; “I have no cause to\r\ncomplain of him; perhaps the mystery may be too soon explained; but let\r\nus not anticipate evils. Oswald and Joseph have spoken like good men;\r\nI am satisfied with their answers; let us, who are innocent, rest in\r\npeace; and let us endeavour to restore peace in the family; and do you,\r\nfather, assist us.”\r\n\r\n“With my best services,” said Oswald. He called the servants in. “Let\r\nnothing be mentioned out of doors,” said he, “of what has lately passed\r\nwithin, especially in the east apartment; the young gentlemen had not so\r\nmuch reason to be frightened as they apprehended; a piece of furniture\r\nfell down in the rooms underneath, which made the noise that alarmed\r\nthem so much; but I can certify that all things in the rooms are in\r\nquiet, and there is nothing to fear. All of you attend me in the chapel\r\nin an hour; do your duties, put your trust in God, and obey your Lord,\r\nand you will find every thing go right as it used to do.”\r\n\r\nThey dispersed; the sun rose, the day came on, and every thing went on\r\nin the usual course; but the servants were not so easily satisfied; they\r\nwhispered that something was wrong, and expected the time that should\r\nset all right. The mind of the Baron was employed in meditating upon\r\nthese circumstances, that seemed to him the forerunners of some great\r\nevents; he sometimes thought of Edmund; he sighed for his expulsion, and\r\nlamented the uncertainty of his fate; but, to his family, he appeared\r\neasy and satisfied.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Edmund’s departure, the fair Emma had many uneasy\r\nhours; she wished to enquire after him, but feared to shew any\r\nsolicitude concerning him. The next day, when her brother William came\r\ninto her apartment, she took courage to ask a question.\r\n\r\n“Pray, brother, can you give any guess what is become of Edmund?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, with a sigh; “why do you ask me?”\r\n\r\n“Because, my dear William, I should think if any body knew, it must be\r\nyou; and I thought he loved you too well to leave you in ignorance. But\r\ndon’t you think he left the castle in a very strange manner?”\r\n\r\n“I do, my dear; there is a mystery in every circumstance of his\r\ndeparture; Nevertheless (I will trust you with a secret), he did not\r\nleave the castle without making a distinction in my favour.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so,” said she; “but you might tell me what you know about\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, my dear Emma! I know nothing. When I saw him last, he seemed\r\na good deal affected, as if he were taking leave of me; and I had a\r\nforeboding that we parted for a longer time than usual.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! so had I,” said she, “when he parted from me in the garden.”\r\n\r\n“What leave did he take of you, Emma?”\r\n\r\nShe blushed, and hesitated to tell him all that passed between them;\r\nbut he begged, persuaded, insisted; and, at length, under the strongest\r\ninjunctions of secrecy, she told him all.\r\n\r\nHe said, “That Edmund’s behaviour on that occasion was as mysterious\r\nas the rest of his conduct; but, now you have revealed your secret, you\r\nhave a right to know mine.”\r\n\r\nHe then gave her the letter he found upon his pillow; she read it with\r\ngreat emotion.\r\n\r\n“Saint Winifred assist me!” said she; “what can I think? ‘The peasant\r\nEdmund is no more, but there lives one,’--that is to my thinking, Edmund\r\nlives, but is no peasant.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, my dear,” said William; “I like your explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, brother, I only guess; but what think you?”\r\n\r\n“I believe we think alike in more than one respect, that he meant to\r\nrecommend no other person than himself to your favour; and, if he were\r\nindeed of noble birth, I would prefer him to a prince for a husband to\r\nmy Emma!”\r\n\r\n“Bless me!” said she, “do you think it possible that he should be of\r\neither birth or fortune?”\r\n\r\n“It is hard to say what is impossible! we have proof that the east\r\napartment is haunted. It was there that Edmund was made acquainted with\r\nmany secrets, I doubt not: and, perhaps, his own fate may be involved in\r\nthat of others. I am confident that what he saw and heard there, was the\r\ncause of his departure. We must wait with patience the unravelling this\r\nintricate affair; I believe I need not enjoin your secrecy as to what I\r\nhave said; your heart will be my security.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you, brother?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t affect ignorance, my dear; you love Edmund, so do I; it is\r\nnothing to be ashamed of. It would have been strange, if a girl of your\r\ngood sense had not distinguished a swan among a flock of geese.”\r\n\r\n“Dear William, don’t let a word of this escape you; but you have taken\r\na weight off my heart. You may depend that I will not dispose of my hand\r\nor heart till I know the end of this affair.”\r\n\r\nWilliam smiled: “Keep them for Edmund’s friend; I shall rejoice to see\r\nhim in a situation to ask them.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, my brother! not a word more; I hear footsteps.”\r\n\r\nThey were her eldest brother’s, who came to ask Mr. William to ride out\r\nwith him, which finished the conference.\r\n\r\nThe fair Emma from this time assumed an air of satisfaction; and William\r\nfrequently stole away from his companions to talk with his sister upon\r\ntheir favourite subject.\r\n\r\nWhile these things passed at the castle of Lovel, Edmund and his\r\ncompanion John Wyatt proceeded on their journey to Sir Philip Harclay’s\r\nseat; they conversed together on the way, and Edmund found him a man of\r\nunderstanding, though not improved by education; he also discovered that\r\nJohn loved his master, and respected him even to veneration; from him he\r\nlearned many particulars concerning that worthy knight. Wyatt told him,\r\n“That Sir Philip maintained twelve old soldiers who had been maimed and\r\ndisabled in the wars, and had no provision made for them; also six\r\nold officers, who had been unfortunate, and were grown grey without\r\npreferment; he likewise mentioned the Greek gentleman, his master’s\r\ncaptive and friend, as a man eminent for valour and piety; but, beside\r\nthese,” said Wyatt, “there are many others who eat of my master’s bread\r\nand drink of his cup, and who join in blessings and prayers to Heaven\r\nfor their noble benefactor; his ears are ever open to distress, his hand\r\nto relieve it, and he shares in every good man’s joys and blessings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a glorious character!” said Edmund; “how my heart throbs with\r\nwishes to imitate such a man! Oh, that I might resemble him, though at\r\never so great a distance!”\r\n\r\nEdmund was never weary of hearing the actions of this truly great man,\r\nnor Wyatt with relating them; and, during three days journey, there were\r\nbut few pauses in their conversation.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day, when they came within view of the house, Edmund’s heart\r\nbegan to raise doubts of his reception. “If,” said he, “Sir Philip\r\nshould not receive me kindly, if he should resent my long neglect, and\r\ndisown my acquaintance, it would be no more than justice.”\r\n\r\nHe sent Wyatt before, to notify his arrival to Sir Philip, while\r\nhe waited at the gate, full of doubts and anxieties concerning his\r\nreception. Wyatt was met and congratulated on his return by most of his\r\nfellow-servants. He asked--\r\n\r\n“Where is my master?”\r\n\r\n“In the parlour.”\r\n\r\n“Are any strangers with him?”\r\n\r\n“No, only his own family.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will shew myself to him.”\r\n\r\nHe presented himself before Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n“So, John,” said he, “you are welcome home! I hope you left your parents\r\nand relations well?”\r\n\r\n“All well, thank God! and send their humble duty to your honour, and\r\nthey pray for you every day of their lives. I hope your honour is in\r\ngood health.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God for that! but, sir, I have something further to tell you;\r\nI have had a companion all the way home, a person who comes to wait on\r\nyour honour, on business of great consequence, as he says.”\r\n\r\n“Who is that, John?”\r\n\r\n“It is Master Edmund Twyford, from the castle of Lovel.”\r\n\r\n“Young Edmund!” says Sir Philip, surprised; “where is he?”\r\n\r\n“At the gate, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you leave him there?”\r\n\r\n“Because he bade me come before, and acquaint your honour, that he waits\r\nyour pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him hither,” said Sir Philip; “tell him I shall be glad to see\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nJohn made haste to deliver his message, and Edmund followed him in\r\nsilence into Sir Philip’s presence.\r\n\r\nHe bowed low, and kept at a distance. Sir Philip held out his hand,\r\nand bad him approach. As he drew near, he was seized with an universal\r\ntrembling; he kneeled down, took his hand, kissed it, and pressed it to\r\nhis heart in silence.\r\n\r\n“You are welcome, young man!” said Sir Philip; “take courage, and speak\r\nfor yourself.”\r\n\r\nEdmund sighed deeply; he at length broke silence with difficulty. “I am\r\ncome thus far, noble sir, to throw myself at your feet, and implore your\r\nprotection. You are, under God, my only reliance.”\r\n\r\n“I receive you,” said Sir Philip, “with all my heart! Your person is\r\ngreatly improved since I saw you last, and I hope your mind is equally\r\nso; I have heard a great character of you from some that knew you in\r\nFrance. I remember the promise I made you long ago, and am ready now\r\nto fulfil it, upon condition that you have done nothing to disgrace the\r\ngood opinion I formerly entertained of you; and am ready to serve you in\r\nany thing consistent with my own honour.”\r\n\r\nEdmund kissed the hand that was extended to raise him. “I accept your\r\nfavour, sir, upon this condition only; and if ever you find me to impose\r\nupon your credulity, or incroach on your goodness, may you renounce me\r\nfrom that moment!”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Sir Philip; “rise, then, and let me embrace you; You are\r\ntruly welcome!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, noble sir!” said Edmund, “I have a strange story to tell you; but\r\nit must be by ourselves, with only heaven to bear witness to what passes\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Sir Philip; “I am ready to hear you; but first, go and\r\nget some refreshment after your journey, and then come to me again. John\r\nWyatt will attend you.”\r\n\r\n“I want no refreshment,” said Edmund; “and I cannot eat or drink till I\r\nhave told my business to your honour.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” said Sir Philip, “come along with me.” He took the youth by\r\nthe hand, and led him into another parlour, leaving his friends in great\r\nsurprise, what this young man’s errand could be; John Wyatt told them\r\nall that he knew relating to Edmund’s birth, character, and situation.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Philip had seated his young friend, he listened in silence to\r\nthe surprising tale he had to tell him. Edmund told him briefly the most\r\nremarkable circumstances of his life, from the time when he first\r\nsaw and liked him, till his return from France; but from that era,\r\nhe related at large every thing that had happened, recounting every\r\ninteresting particular, which was imprinted on his memory in strong and\r\nlasting characters. Sir Philip grew every moment more affected by the\r\nrecital; sometimes he clasped his hands together, he lifted them up to\r\nheaven, he smote his breast, he sighed, he exclaimed aloud; when Edmund\r\nrelated his dream, he breathed short, and seemed to devour him with\r\nattention; when he described the fatal closet, he trembled, sighed,\r\nsobbed, and was almost suffocated with his agitation. But when he\r\nrelated all that passed between his supposed mother and himself, and\r\nfinally produced the jewels, the proofs of his birth, and the death of\r\nhis unfortunate mother, he flew to him, he pressed him to his bosom, he\r\nstrove to speak, but speech was for some minutes denied. He wept aloud;\r\nand, at length, his words found their way in broken exclamations.\r\n\r\n“Son of my dearest friend! Dear and precious relic of a noble house!\r\nchild of Providence! the beloved of heaven! welcome! thrice welcome to\r\nmy arms! to my heart! I will be thy parent from henceforward, and thou\r\nshalt be indeed my child, my heir! My mind told me from the first moment\r\nI beheld thee, that thou wert the image of my friend! my heart then\r\nopened itself to receive thee, as his offspring. I had a strange\r\nforeboding that I was to be thy protector. I would then have made\r\nthee my own; but heaven orders things for the best; it made thee the\r\ninstrument of this discovery, and in its own time and manner conducted\r\nthee to my arms. Praise be to God for his wonderful doings towards the\r\nchildren of men! every thing that has befallen thee is by his direction,\r\nand he will not leave his work unfinished; I trust that I shall be his\r\ninstrument to do justice on the guilty, and to restore the orphan of\r\nmy friend to his rights and title. I devote myself to this service, and\r\nwill make it the business of my life to effect it.”\r\n\r\nEdmund gave vent to his emotions, in raptures of joy and gratitude.\r\nThey spent several hours in this way, without thinking of the time that\r\npassed; the one enquiring, the other explaining, and repeating, every\r\nparticular of the interesting story.\r\n\r\nAt length they were interrupted by the careful John Wyatt, who was\r\nanxious to know if any thing was likely to give trouble to his master.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said John, “it grows dark--do you want a light?”\r\n\r\n“We want no light but what heaven gives us,” said Sir Philip; “I knew\r\nnot whether it was dark or light.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said John, “nothing has happened, I hope your honour has heard\r\nno bad tidings; I--I--I hope no offence.”\r\n\r\n“None at all,” said the good knight; “I am obliged to your solicitude\r\nfor me; I have heard some things that grieve me, and others that give me\r\ngreat pleasure; but the sorrows are past, and the joys remain.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” said John; “I was afraid something was the matter to give\r\nyour honour trouble.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, my good servant! You see this young gentleman; I would\r\nhave you, John, devote yourself to his service; I give you to him for an\r\nattendant on his person, and would have you show your affection to me by\r\nyour attachment to him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sir!” said John in a melancholy voice, “what have I done to be\r\nturned out of your service?”\r\n\r\n“No such matter, John,” said Sir Philip; “you will not leave my\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said John, “I would rather die than leave you.”\r\n\r\n“And, my lad, I like you too well to part with you; but in serving my\r\nfriend you will serve me. Know, that this young man is my son.”\r\n\r\n“Your son, sir!” said John.\r\n\r\n“Not my natural son, but my relation; my son by adoption, my heir!”\r\n\r\n“And will he live with you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, John; and I hope to die with him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then, I will serve him with all my heart and soul; and I will do my\r\nbest to please you both.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, John, and I will not forget your honest love and duty.\r\nI have so good an opinion of you, that I will tell you of some things\r\nconcerning this gentleman that will entitle him to your respect.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis enough for me,” said John, “to know that your honour respects him,\r\nto make me pay him as much duty as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“But, John, when you know him better, you will respect him still more;\r\nat present, I shall only tell you what he is not; for you think him only\r\nthe son of Andrew Twyford.”\r\n\r\n“And is he not?” said John.\r\n\r\n“No, but his wife nursed him, and he passed for her son.”\r\n\r\n“And does old Twyford know it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“He does, and will bear witness to it; but he is the son of a near\r\nfriend of mine, of quality superior to my own, and as such you must\r\nserve and respect him.”\r\n\r\n“I shall, to be sure, sir; but what name shall I call him?”\r\n\r\n“You shall know that hereafter; in the mean time bring a light, and wait\r\non us to the other parlour.”\r\n\r\nWhen John was withdrawn, Sir Philip said, “That is a point to be\r\nconsidered and determined immediately; It is proper that you should\r\nassume a name till you can take that of your father; for I choose you\r\nshould drop that of your foster-father; and I would have you be called\r\nby one that is respectable.”\r\n\r\n“In that, and every other point, I will be wholly governed by you, sir,”\r\n said Edmund.\r\n\r\n“Well then, I will give you the name of Seagrave; I shall say that you\r\nare a relation of my own; and my mother was really of that family.”\r\n\r\nJohn soon returned, and attended them into the other parlour; Sir Philip\r\nentered, with Edmund in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, “this gentleman is Mr. Edward Seagrave, the\r\nson of a dear friend and relation of mine. He was lost in his infancy,\r\nbrought up by a good woman out of pure humanity, and is but lately\r\nrestored to his own family. The circumstances shall be made known\r\nhereafter; In the meantime, I have taken him under my care and\r\nprotection, and will use all my power and interest to see him restored\r\nto his fortune, which is enjoyed by the usurper who was the cause of his\r\nexpulsion, and the death of his parents. Receive him as my relation,\r\nand friend; Zadisky, do you embrace him first. Edmund, you and this\r\ngentleman must love each other for my sake; hereafter you will do it for\r\nyour own.[”] They all rose; each embraced and congratulated the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\nZadisky said, “Sir, whatever griefs and misfortunes you may have\r\nendured, you may reckon them at an end, from the hour you are beloved\r\nand protected by Sir Philip Harclay.”\r\n\r\n“I firmly believe it, sir,” replied Edmund; “and my heart enjoys,\r\nalready, more happiness than I ever yet felt, and promises me all that I\r\ncan wish in future; his friendship is the earnest Heaven gives me of its\r\nblessings hereafter.”\r\n\r\nThey sat down to supper with mutual cheerfulness; and Edmund enjoyed the\r\nrepast with more satisfaction than he had felt a long time. Sir Philip\r\nsaw his countenance brighten up, and looked on him with heart-felt\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n“Every time I look on you,” said he, “reminds me of your father; you\r\nare the same person I loved twenty-three years ago--I rejoice to see you\r\nunder my roof. Go to your repose early, and to-morrow we will consult\r\nfarther.”\r\n\r\nEdmund withdrew, and enjoyed a night of sweet undisturbed repose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Edmund arose in perfect health and spirits: he waited\r\non his benefactor. They were soon after joined by Zadisky, who shewed\r\ngreat attention and respect to the youth, and offered him his best\r\nservices without reserve. Edmund accepted them with equal respect and\r\nmodesty; and finding himself at ease, began to display his amiable\r\nqualities. They breakfasted together; afterwards, Sir Philip desired\r\nEdmund to walk out with him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of hearing, Sir Philip said, “I could not sleep\r\nlast night for thinking of your affairs; I laid schemes for you, and\r\nrejected them again. We must lay our plan before we begin to act. What\r\nshall be done with this treacherous kinsman! this inhuman monster! this\r\nassassin of his nearest relation? I will risk my life and fortune to\r\nbring him to justice. Shall I go to court, and demand justice of the\r\nking? or shall I accuse him of the murder, and make him stand a public\r\ntrial? If I treat him as a baron of the realm, he must be tried by his\r\npeers; if as a commoner, he must be tried at the county assize; but we\r\nmust shew reason why he should be degraded from his title. Have you any\r\nthing to propose?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir; I have only to wish that it might be as private as\r\npossible, for the sake of my noble benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen, upon\r\nwhom some part of the family disgrace would naturally fall; and that\r\nwould be an ill return for all his kindness and generosity to me.”\r\n\r\n“That is a generous and grateful consideration on your part; but you owe\r\nstill more to the memory of your injured parents. However, there is\r\nyet another way that suits me better than any hitherto proposed; I will\r\nchallenge the traitor to meet me in the field; and, if he has spirit\r\nenough to answer my call, I will there bring him to justice; if not, I\r\nwill bring him to a public trial.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Edmund, “that is my province. Should I stand by and see\r\nmy noble, gallant friend expose his life for me, I should be unworthy to\r\nbear the name of that friend whom you so much lament. It will become\r\nhis son to vindicate his name, and revenge his death. I will be the\r\nchallenger, and no other.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think he will answer the challenge of an unknown youth, with\r\nnothing but his pretensions to his name and title? Certainly not. Leave\r\nthis matter to me; I will think of a way that will oblige him to meet me at\r\nthe house of a third person who is known to all the parties concerned,\r\nand where we will have authentic witnesses of all that passes between\r\nhim and me. I will devise the time, place, and manner, and satisfy all\r\nyour scruples.”\r\n\r\nEdmund offered to reply; but Sir Philip bad him be silent, and let him\r\nproceed in his own way.\r\n\r\nHe then led him over his estate, and shewed him every thing deserving\r\nhis notice; he told him all the particulars of his domestic economy, and\r\nthey returned home in time to meet their friends at dinner.\r\n\r\nThey spent several days in consulting how to bring Sir Walter to\r\naccount, and in improving their friendship and confidence in each\r\nother. Edmund endeared himself so much to his friend and patron, that\r\nhe declared him his adopted son and heir before all his friends and\r\nservants, and ordered them to respect him as such. He every day improved\r\ntheir love and regard for him, and became the darling of the whole\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, Sir Philip fixed his resolutions, and began\r\nto execute his purposes. He set out for the seat of the Lord Clifford,\r\nattended by Edmund, M. Zadisky, and two servants. Lord Clifford received\r\nthem with kindness and hospitality.\r\n\r\nSir Philip presented Edmund to Lord Clifford and his family, as his near\r\nrelation and presumptive heir; They spent the evening in the pleasures\r\nof convivial mirth and hospitable entertainment. The next day Sir Philip\r\nbegan to open his mind to Lord Clifford, informing him that both his\r\nyoung friend and himself had received great injuries from the present\r\nLord Lovel, for which they were resolved to call him to account; but\r\nthat, for many reasons, they were desirous to have proper witnesses\r\nof all that should pass between them, and begging the favour of his\r\nLordship to be the principal one. Lord Clifford acknowledged the\r\nconfidence placed in him; and besought Sir Philip to let him be the\r\narbitrator between them. Sir Philip assured him, that their wrongs would\r\nnot admit of arbitration, as he should hereafter judge; but that he was\r\nunwilling to explain them further till he knew certainly whether or not\r\nthe Lord Lovel would meet him; for, if he refused, he must take another\r\nmethod with him.\r\n\r\nLord Clifford was desirous to know the grounds of the quarrel; but Sir\r\nPhilip declined entering into particulars at present, assuring him of\r\na full information hereafter. He then sent M. Zadisky, attended by John\r\nWyatt, and a servant of Lord Clifford, with a letter to Lord Lovel; the\r\ncontents were as follow:--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Lovel,--Sir Philip Harclay earnestly desires to see you at the\r\nhouse of Lord Clifford, where he waits to call you to account for the\r\ninjuries done by you to the late Arthur Lord Lovel, your kinsman; If you\r\naccept his demand, he will make the Lord Clifford a witness and a judge\r\nof the cause; if not, he will expose you publicly as a traitor and a\r\ncoward. Please to answer this letter, and he will acquaint you with the\r\ntime, place, and manner of the meeting.\r\n\r\n“PHILIP HARCLAY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nZadisky presented the letter to Lord Lovel, informing him that he was\r\nthe friend of Sir Philip Harclay. He seemed surprised and confounded at\r\nthe contents; but, putting on an haughty air, “I know nothing,” said\r\nhe, “of the business this letter hints at; but wait a few hours, and I\r\nwill give you an answer.” He gave orders to treat Zadisky as a gentleman\r\nin every respect, except in avoiding his company; for the Greek had\r\na shrewd and penetrating aspect, and he observed every turn of his\r\ncountenance. The next day he came and apologized for his absence, and\r\ngave him the answer; sending his respects to the Lord Clifford. The\r\nmessengers returned with all speed, and Sir Philip read the answer\r\nbefore all present.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Lord Lovel knows not of any injuries done by him to the late Arthur\r\nLord Lovel, whom he succeeded by just right of inheritance; nor of any\r\nright Sir Philip Harclay has, to call to account a man to whom he is\r\nbarely known, having seen him only once, many years ago, at the house of\r\nhis uncle, the old Lord Lovel: Nevertheless, Lord Lovel will not suffer\r\nany man to call his name and honour into question with impunity; for\r\nwhich reason he will meet Sir Philip Harclay at any time, place, and in\r\nwhat manner he shall appoint, bringing the same number of friends and\r\ndependents, that justice may be done to all parties.\r\n\r\n“LOVEL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Tis well,” said Sir Philip; “I am glad to find he has the spirit to\r\nmeet me; he is an enemy worthy of my sword.”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford then proposed that both parties should pass the borders,\r\nand obtain leave of the warden of the Scottish marches to decide the\r\nquarrel in his jurisdiction, with a select number of friends on both\r\nsides. Sir Philip agreed to the proposal; and Lord Clifford wrote in his\r\nown name to ask permission of the Lord Graham, that his friends might\r\ncome there; and obtained it, on condition that neither party should\r\nexceed a limited number of friends and followers.\r\n\r\nLord Clifford sent chosen messengers to Lord Lovel, acquainting him\r\nwith the conditions, and appointing the time, place, and manner of their\r\nmeeting, and that he had been desired to accept the office of judge of\r\nthe field. Lord Lovel accepted the conditions, and promised to be there\r\nwithout fail. Lord Clifford notified the same to Lord Graham, warden of\r\nthe marches, who caused a piece of ground to be inclosed for the lists,\r\nand made preparations against the day appointed.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, Sir Philip Harclay thought proper to settle his worldly\r\naffairs. He made Zadisky acquainted with every circumstance of Edmund’s\r\nhistory, and the obligation that lay upon him to revenge the death of\r\nhis friend, and see justice done to his heir. Zadisky entered into the\r\ncause with an ardour that spoke the affection he bore to his friend.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “would you not suffer me to engage this traitor? Your\r\nlife is of too much consequence to be staked against his; but though\r\nI trust that the justice of your cause must succeed, yet, if it should\r\nhappen otherwise, I vow to revenge you; he shall never go back from us\r\nboth. However, my hope and trust is, to see your arm the minister of\r\njustice.”\r\n\r\n Sir Philip then sent for a lawyer and made his will, by which he\r\nappointed Edmund his chief heir, by the name of Lovel, alias Seagrave,\r\nalias Twyford; he ordered that all his old friends, soldiers, and\r\nservants, should be maintained in the same manner during their lives;\r\nhe left to Zadisky an annuity of an hundred a year, and a legacy of two\r\nhundred pounds; one hundred pounds to a certain monastery; the same sum\r\nto be distributed among disbanded soldiers, and the same to the poor and\r\nneedy in his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHe appointed Lord Clifford joint executor with Edmund, and gave his\r\nwill into that nobleman’s care, recommending Edmund to his favour and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n“If I live,” said he, “I will make him appear to be worthy of it; if I\r\ndie, he will want a friend. I am desirous your lordship, as a judge of\r\nthe field, should be unprejudiced on either side, that you may judge\r\nimpartially. If I die, Edmund’s pretensions die with me; but my friend\r\nZadisky will acquaint you with the foundation of them. I take these\r\nprecautions, because I ought to be prepared for every thing; but my\r\nheart is warm with better hopes, and I trust I shall live to justify\r\nmy own cause, as well as that of my friend, who is a person of more\r\nconsequence than he appears to be.”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford accepted the trust, and expressed the greatest reliance\r\nupon Sir Philip’s honour and veracity.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were making for the great event that was to\r\ndecide the pretensions of Edmund, his enemies at the Castle of Lovel\r\nwere brought to shame for their behaviour to him.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement between Wenlock and Markham had by degrees brought on\r\nan explanation of some parts of their conduct. Father Oswald had often\r\nhinted to the Baron, Wenlock’s envy of Edmund’s superior qualities,\r\nand the artifices by which he had obtained such an influence with Sir\r\nRobert, as to make him take his part upon all occasions. Oswald now\r\ntook advantage of the breach between these two incendiaries, to persuade\r\nMarkham to justify himself at Wenlock’s expence, and to tell all he\r\nknew of his wickedness; at length, he promised to declare all he knew\r\nof Wenlock’s conduct, as well in France as since their return, when he\r\nshould be called upon; and, by him, Oswald was enabled to unravel the\r\nwhole of his contrivances, against the honour, interest, and even life\r\nof Edmund.\r\n\r\nHe prevailed on Hewson, and Kemp, his associate, to add their testimony\r\nto the others. Hewson confessed that he was touched in his conscience,\r\nwhen he reflected on the cruelty and injustice of his behaviour to\r\nEdmund, whose behaviour towards him, after he had laid a snare for his\r\nlife, was so noble and generous, that he was cut to the heart by it,\r\nand had suffered so much pain and remorse, that he longed for nothing\r\nso much as an opportunity to unburden his mind; but the dread of Mr.\r\nWenlock’s anger, and the effects of his resentment, had hitherto kept\r\nhim silent, always hoping there would come a time, when he might have\r\nleave to declare the whole truth.\r\n\r\nOswald conveyed this information to the Baron’s ear, who waited for\r\nan opportunity to make the proper use of it. Not long after, the two\r\nprincipal incendiaries came to an open rupture, and Markham threatened\r\nWenlock that he would shew his uncle what a serpent he had harboured in\r\nhis bosom. The Baron arrested his words, and insisted upon his telling\r\nall he knew; adding,--\r\n\r\n“If you speak the truth, I will support you; but if you prove false, I\r\nwill punish you severely. As to Mr. Wenlock, he shall have a fair trial;\r\nand, if all the accusations I have heard are made good, it is high time\r\nthat I should put him out of my family.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron, with a stern aspect, bade them follow him into the great\r\nhall; and sent for all the rest of the family together.\r\n\r\nHe then, with great solemnity, told them he was ready to hear all sides\r\nof the question. He declared the whole substance of his informations,\r\nand called upon the accusers to support the charge. Hewson and Kemp gave\r\nthe same account they had done to Oswald, offering to swear to the\r\ntruth of their testimony; several of the other servants related such\r\ncircumstances as had come to their knowledge. Markham then spoke of\r\nevery thing, and gave a particular account of all that had passed on\r\nthe night they spent in the east apartment; he accused himself of being\r\nprivy to Wenlock’s villany, called himself fool and blockhead for being\r\nthe instrument of his malignant disposition, and asked pardon of his\r\nuncle for concealing it so long.\r\n\r\nThe Baron called upon Wenlock to reply to the charge; who, instead of\r\nanswering, flew into a passion, raged, swore, threatened, and finally\r\ndenied every thing. The witnesses persisted in their assertions. Markham\r\ndesired leave to make known the reason why they were all afraid of him.\r\n\r\n“He gives it out,” said he, “that he is to be my lord’s son-in-law;\r\nand they, supposing him to stand first in his favour, are afraid of his\r\ndispleasure.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said the Baron, “I shall not be at such a loss for a\r\nson-in-law, as to make choice of such a one as him; he never but once\r\nhinted at such a thing, and then I gave him no encouragement. I have\r\nlong seen there was something very wrong in him; but I did not believe\r\nhe was of so wicked a disposition; It is no wonder that princes should\r\nbe so frequently deceived, when I, a private man, could be so much\r\nimposed upon within the circle of my own family. What think you, son\r\nRobert?”\r\n\r\n“I, sir, have been much more imposed on; and I take shame to myself on\r\nthe occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, my son,” said the Baron; “a generous confession is only a proof\r\nof growing wisdom. You are now sensible, that the best of us are liable\r\nto imposition. The artifices of this unworthy kinsman have set us at\r\nvariance with each other, and driven away an excellent youth from this\r\nhouse, to go I know not whither; but he shall no longer triumph in his\r\nwickedness; he shall feel what it is to be banished from the house of\r\nhis protector. He shall set out for his mother’s this very day; I will\r\nwrite to her in such a manner as shall inform her that he has offended\r\nme, without particularising the nature of his faults; I will give him an\r\nopportunity of recovering his credit with his own family, and this shall\r\nbe my security against his doing further mischief. May he repent, and be\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\n“Markham deserves punishment, but not in the same degree.”\r\n\r\n“I confess it,” said he, “and will submit to whatever your lordship\r\nshall enjoin.”\r\n\r\n“You shall only be banished for a time, but he for ever. I will send\r\nyou abroad on a business that shall put you in a way to do credit to\r\nyourself, and service to me. Son Robert, have you any objection to my\r\nsentence?”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said he, “I have great reason to distrust myself; I am\r\nsensible of my own weakness, and your superior wisdom, as well as\r\ngoodness; and I will henceforward submit to you in all things.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron ordered two of his servants to pack up Wenlock’s clothes and\r\nnecessaries, and to set out with him that very day; he bade some others\r\nkeep an eye upon him lest he should escape; As soon as they were ready,\r\nmy Lord wished him a good journey, and gave him a letter for his mother.\r\nHe departed without saying a word, in a sullen kind of resentment, but\r\nhis countenance shewed the inward agitations of his mind.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, every mouth was opened against him; a thousand\r\nstories came out that they never heard before; The Baron and his sons\r\nwere astonished that he should go on so long without detection. My lord\r\nsighed deeply at the thoughts of Edmund’s expulsion, and ardently wished\r\nto know what was become of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Robert took the opportunity of coming to an explanation with his\r\nbrother William; he took shame to himself for some part of his past\r\nbehaviour. Mr. William owned his affection to Edmund, and justified it\r\nby his merit and attachment to him, which were such that he was\r\ncertain no time or distance could alter them. He accepted his brother’s\r\nacknowledgement, as a full amends for all that had passed, and begged\r\nthat henceforward an entire love and confidence might ever subsist\r\nbetween them. These new regulations restored peace, confidence, and\r\nharmony, in the Castle of Lovel.\r\n\r\nAt length, the day arrived for the combatants to meet. The Lord Graham,\r\nwith twelve followers gentlemen, and twelve servants, was ready at the\r\ndawn of day to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe first that entered the field, was Sir Philip Harclay, knight, armed\r\ncompletely, excepting his head-piece; Hugh Rugby, his esquire, bearing\r\nhis lance; John Barnard, his page, carrying his helmet and spurs; and\r\ntwo servants in his proper livery. The next came Edmund, the heir of\r\nLovel, followed by his servant John Wyatt; Zadisky, followed by his\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a short distance came the Lord Clifford, as judge of the field, with\r\nhis esquire, two pages, and two livery-servants; followed by his eldest\r\nson, his nephew, and a gentleman his friend, each attended by one\r\nservant; He also brought a surgeon of note to take care of the wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Graham saluted them; and, by his order, they took their places\r\nwithout the lists, and the trumpet sounded for the challenger. It was\r\nanswered by the defendant, who soon after appeared, attended by three\r\ngentlemen his friends, with each one servant, beside his own proper\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nA place was erected for the Lord Clifford, as judge of the field;\r\nhe desired Lord Graham would share the office, who accepted it, on\r\ncondition that the combatants should make no objection, and they agreed\r\nto it with the greatest courtesy and respect. They consulted together on\r\nmany points of honour and ceremony between the two combatants.\r\n\r\nThey appointed a marshal of the field, and other inferior officers,\r\nusually employed on these occasions. The Lord Graham sent the marshal\r\nfor the challenger, desiring him to declare the cause of his quarrel\r\nbefore his enemy. Sir Philip Harclay then advanced, and thus spoke:\r\n\r\n“I, Philip Harclay, knight, challenge Walter, commonly called Lord\r\nLovel, as a base, treacherous, and bloody man, who, by his wicked arts\r\nand devices, did kill, or cause to be killed, his kinsman, Arthur Lord\r\nLovel, my dear and noble friend. I am called upon, in an extraordinary\r\nmanner, to revenge his death; and I will prove the truth of what I have\r\naffirmed at the peril of my life.”\r\n\r\nLord Graham then bade the defendant answer to the charge. Lord Lovel\r\nstood forth before his followers, and thus replied:\r\n\r\n“I, Walter, Baron of Lovel, do deny the charge against me, and affirm\r\nit to be a base, false, and malicious accusation of this Sir Philip\r\nHarclay, which I believe to be invented by himself, or else framed by\r\nsome enemy, and told to him for wicked ends; but, be that as it may, I\r\nwill maintain my own honour, and prove him to be a false traitor, at the\r\nhazard of my own life, and to the punishment of his presumption.”\r\n\r\nThen said the Lord Graham, “will not this quarrel admit of arbitration?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Sir Philip; “when I have justified this charge, I have\r\nmore to bring against him. I trust in God and the justice of my cause,\r\nand defy that traitor to the death!”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford then spoke a few words to Lord Graham, who immediately\r\ncalled to the marshal, and bade him open the lists, and deliver their\r\nweapons to the combatants.\r\n\r\nWhile the marshal was arranging the combatants and their followers,\r\nEdmund approached his friend and patron; he put one knee to the ground,\r\nhe embraced his knees with the strongest emotions of grief and anxiety.\r\nHe was dressed in complete armour, with his visor down; his device was\r\na hawthorn, with a graft of the rose upon it, the motto--This is not my\r\ntrue parent; but Sir Philip bade him take these words--E fructu arbor\r\ncognoscitur.\r\n\r\nSir Philip embraced the youth with strong marks of affection. “Be\r\ncomposed, my child!” said he; “I have neither guilt, fear, nor doubt\r\nin me; I am so certain of success, that I bid you be prepared for the\r\nconsequence.”\r\n\r\nZadisky embraced his friend, he comforted Edmund, he suggested every\r\nthing that could confirm his hopes of success.\r\n\r\nThe marshal waited to deliver the spear to Sir Philip; he now presented\r\nit with the usual form.\r\n\r\n“Sir, receive your lance, and God defend the right!”\r\n\r\nSir Philip answered, “Amen!” in a voice that was heard by all present.\r\n\r\nHe next presented his weapon to Lord Lovel with the same sentence, who\r\nlikewise answered “Amen!” with a good courage. Immediately the lists\r\nwere cleared, and the combatants began to fight.\r\n\r\nThey contended a long time with equal skill and courage; at length\r\nSir Philip unhorsed his antagonist. The judges ordered, that either he\r\nshould alight, or suffer his enemy to remount; he chose the former, and\r\na short combat on foot ensued. The sweat ran off their bodies with the\r\nviolence of the exercise. Sir Philip watched every motion of his enemy,\r\nand strove to weary him out, intending to wound, but not to kill him,\r\nunless obliged for his own safety.\r\n\r\nHe thrust his sword through his left arm, and demanded, whether he would\r\nconfess the fact? Lord Lovel enraged, answered, he would die sooner.\r\nSir Philip then passed the sword through his body twice, and Lord Lovel\r\nfell, crying out that he was slain.\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” said Sir Philip, “for I have a great deal of business for\r\nyou to do before you die: confess your sins, and endeavour to atone for\r\nthem, as the only ground to hope for pardon.”\r\n\r\nLord Lovel replied, “You are the victor, use your good fortune\r\ngenerously!”\r\n\r\nSir Philip took away his sword, and then waved it over his head, and\r\nbeckoned for assistance. The judges sent to beg Sir Philip to spare the\r\nlife of his enemy.\r\n\r\n“I will,” said he, “upon condition that he will make an honest\r\nconfession.”\r\n\r\nLord Lovel desired a surgeon and a confessor.\r\n\r\n“You shall have both,” said Sir Philip; “but you must first answer me a\r\nquestion or two. Did you kill your kinsman or not?”\r\n\r\n“It was not my hand that killed him,” answered the wounded man.\r\n\r\n“It was done by your own order, however? You shall have no assistance\r\ntill you answer this point.”\r\n\r\n“It was,” said he, “and Heaven is just!”\r\n\r\n“Bear witness all present,” said Sir Philip; “he confesses the fact!”\r\n\r\nHe then beckoned Edmund, who approached.\r\n\r\n“Take off your helmet,” said he; “look on that youth, he is the son of\r\nyour injured kinsman.”\r\n\r\n“It is himself!” said the Lord Lovel, and fainted away.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then called for a surgeon and a priest, both of which Lord\r\nGraham had provided; the former began to bind up his wounds, and his\r\nassistants poured a cordial into his mouth. “Preserve his life, if it be\r\npossible,” said Sir Philip; “for much depends upon it.”\r\n\r\nHe then took Edmund by the hand, and presented him to all the company.\r\n“In this young man,” said he, “you see the true heir of the house of\r\nLovel! Heaven has in its own way made him the instrument to discover\r\nthe death of his parents. His father was assassinated by order of that\r\nwicked man, who now receives his punishment; his mother was, by his\r\ncruel treatment, compelled to leave her own house; she was delivered in\r\nthe fields, and perished herself in seeking a shelter for her infant.\r\nI have sufficient proofs of every thing I say, which I am ready to\r\ncommunicate to every person who desires to know the particulars. Heaven,\r\nby my hand, has chastised him; he has confessed the fact I accuse him\r\nof, and it remains that he make restitution of the fortune and honours\r\nhe hath usurped so long.”\r\n\r\nEdmund kneeled, and with uplifted hands returned thanks to Heaven, that\r\nhis noble friend and champion was crowned with victory. The lords and\r\ngentlemen gathered round them, they congratulated them both; while Lord\r\nLovel’s friends and followers were employed in taking care of him. Lord\r\nClifford took Sir Philip’s hand.\r\n\r\n“You have acted with so much honour and prudence, that it is\r\npresumptuous to offer you advice; but what mean you to do with the\r\nwounded man?”\r\n\r\n“I have not determined,” said he; “I thank you for the hint, and beg\r\nyour advice how to proceed.”\r\n\r\n“Let us consult Lord Graham,” replied he.\r\n\r\nLord Graham insisted upon their going all to his castle: “There,” said\r\nhe, “you will have impartial witnesses of all that passes.” Sir Philip\r\nwas unwilling to give so much trouble. The Lord Graham protested he\r\nshould be proud to do any service to so noble a gentleman. Lord Clifford\r\nenforced his request, saying, it was better upon all accounts to keep\r\ntheir prisoner on this side the borders till they saw what turn his\r\nhealth would take, and to keep him safely till he had settled his\r\nworldly affairs.\r\n\r\nThis resolution being taken, Lord Graham invited the wounded man and\r\nhis friends to his castle, as being the nearest place where he could\r\nbe lodged and taken proper care of, it being dangerous to carry him\r\nfurther. They accepted the proposal with many acknowledgements; and,\r\nhaving made a kind of litter of boughs, they all proceeded to Lord\r\nGraham’s castle, where they put Lord Lovel to bed, and the surgeon\r\ndressed his wounds, and desired he might be kept quiet, not knowing at\r\npresent whether they were dangerous or not.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after, the wounded man complained of thirst; he asked\r\nfor the surgeon, and enquired if his life was in danger? The surgeon\r\nanswered him doubtfully. He asked--\r\n\r\n“Where is Sir Philip Harclay?”\r\n\r\n“In the castle.”\r\n\r\n“Where is that young man whom he calls the heir of Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“He is here, too.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am surrounded with my enemies. I want to speak to one of my own\r\nservants, without witnesses; let one be sent to me.”\r\n\r\nThe surgeon withdrew, and acquainted the gentlemen below. “He shall not\r\nspeak to any man,” said Sir Philip, “but in my presence.” He went with\r\nhim into the sick man’s room. Upon the sight of Sir Philip, he seemed in\r\ngreat agitation.\r\n\r\n“Am I not allowed to speak with my own servant?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, you may; but not without witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am a prisoner, it seems?”\r\n\r\n“No, not so, sir; but some caution is necessary at present. But compose\r\nyourself, I do not wish for your death.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you seek it? I never injured you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you have, in the person of my friend, and I am only the instrument\r\nof justice in the hand of Heaven; endeavour to make atonement while\r\nlife is spared to you. Shall I send the priest to you? perhaps he\r\nmay convince you of the necessity of restitution, in order to obtain\r\nforgiveness of your sins.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip sent for the priest and the surgeon, and obliged the servant\r\nto retire with him. “I leave you, sir, to the care of these gentlemen;\r\nand whenever a third person is admitted, I will be his attendant; I will\r\nvisit you again within an hour.”\r\n\r\nHe then retired, and consulted his friends below; they were of opinion\r\nthat no time should be lost. “You will then,” said he, “accompany me\r\ninto the sick man’s apartment in an hour’s time.”\r\n\r\nWithin the hour, Sir Philip, attended by Lord Clifford and Lord Graham,\r\nentered the chamber. Lord Lovel was in great emotion; the priest stood\r\non one side of the bed, the surgeon on the other; the former exhorted\r\nhim to confess his sins, the other desired he might be left to his\r\nrepose. Lord Lovel seemed in great anguish of mind; he trembled, and was\r\nin the utmost confusion. Sir Philip intreated him, with the piety of\r\na confessor, to consider his soul’s health before that of his body. He\r\nthen asked Sir Philip, by what means he knew that he was concerned in\r\nthe death of his kinsman?\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied he, “it was not merely by human means this fact was\r\ndiscovered. There is a certain apartment in the Castle of Lovel, that\r\nhas been shut up these one and twenty years, but has lately been opened\r\nand examined into.”\r\n\r\n“O Heaven!” exclaimed he, “then Geoffry must have betrayed me!”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, he has not; it was revealed in a very extraordinary manner to\r\nthat youth whom it most concerns.”\r\n\r\n“How can he be the heir of Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“By being the son of that unfortunate woman, whom you cruelly obliged to\r\nleave her own house, to avoid being compelled to wed the murderer of her\r\nhusband: we are not ignorant, moreover, of the fictitious funeral you\r\nmade for her. All is discovered, and you will not tell us any more than\r\nwe know already; but we desire to have it confirmed by your confession.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The judgments of Heaven are fallen upon me!” said Lord Lovel. “I am\r\nchildless, and one is arisen from the grave to claim my inheritance.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, then, hinders you to do justice and make restitution; it is\r\nfor the ease of your conscience; and you have no other way of making\r\natonement for all the mischief you have done.”\r\n\r\n“You know too much,” said the criminal, “and I will relate what you do\r\nnot know.”\r\n\r\n“You may remember,” proceeded he, “that I saw you once at my uncle’s\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“I well remember it.”\r\n\r\n“At that time my mind was disturbed by the baleful passion of envy; it\r\nwas from that root all my bad actions sprung.”\r\n\r\n“Praise be to God!” said the good priest; “he hath touched your heart\r\nwith true contrition, and you shew the effect of his mercies; you will\r\ndo justice, and you will be rewarded by the gift of repentance unto\r\nsalvation.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip desired the penitent to proceed.\r\n\r\n“My kinsman excelled me in every kind of merit, in the graces of person\r\nand mind, in all his exercises, and in every accomplishment. I was\r\ntotally eclipsed by him, and I hated to be in his company; but what\r\nfinished my aversion, was his addressing the lady upon whom I had\r\nfixed my affections. I strove to rival him there, but she gave him the\r\npreference that, indeed, was only his due; but I could not bear to see,\r\nor acknowledge, it.\r\n\r\n“The most bitter hatred took possession of my breast, and I vowed to\r\nrevenge the supposed injury as soon as opportunity should offer. I\r\nburied my resentment deep in my heart, and outwardly appeared to rejoice\r\nat his success. I made a merit of resigning my pretensions to him, but\r\nI could not bear to be present at his nuptials; I retired to my father’s\r\nseat, and brooded over my revenge in secret. My father died this year,\r\nand soon after my uncle followed him; within another year my kinsman was\r\nsummoned to attend the king on his Welch expedition.\r\n\r\n“As soon as I heard he was gone from home, I resolved to prevent his\r\nreturn, exulting in the prospect of possessing his title, fortune, and\r\nhis lady. I hired messengers, who were constantly going and coming to\r\ngive me intelligence of all that passed at the castle; I went there soon\r\nafter, under pretence of visiting my kinsman. My spies brought me\r\nan account of all that happened; one informed me of the event of the\r\nbattle, but could not tell whether my rival was living or dead; I hoped\r\nthe latter, that I might avoid the crime I meditated. I reported his\r\ndeath to his Lady, who took it very heavily.\r\n\r\n“Soon after a messenger arrived with tidings that he was alive and well,\r\nand had obtained leave to return home immediately.\r\n\r\n“I instantly dispatched my two emissaries to intercept him on the way.\r\nHe made so much haste to return, that he was met within a mile of his\r\nown castle; he had out-rode his servants, and was alone. They killed\r\nhim, and drew him aside out of the highway. They then came to me with\r\nall speed, and desired my orders; it was then about sunset. I sent\r\nthem back to fetch the dead body, which they brought privately into the\r\ncastle: they tied it neck and heels, and put it into a trunk, which they\r\nburied under the floor in the closet you mentioned. The sight of the\r\nbody stung me to the heart; I then felt the pangs of remorse, but it was\r\ntoo late; I took every precaution that prudence suggested to prevent the\r\ndiscovery; but nothing can be concealed from the eye of Heaven.\r\n\r\n“From that fatal hour I have never known peace, always in fear of\r\nsomething impending to discover my guilt, and to bring me to shame; at\r\nlength I am overtaken by justice. I am brought to a severe reckoning\r\nhere, and I dread to meet one more severe hereafter.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said the priest; “you have done a good work, my son! trust in\r\nthe Lord; and, now this burden is off your mind, the rest will be made\r\neasy to you.”\r\n\r\nLord Lovel took a minute’s repose, and then went on.\r\n\r\n“I hope by the hint you gave, Sir Philip, the poor lady is yet alive?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, she is not; but she died not till after she brought forth a\r\nson, whom Heaven made its instrument to discover and avenge the death of\r\nboth his parents.”\r\n\r\n“They are well avenged!” said he. “I have no children to lament for\r\nme; all mine have been taken from me in the bloom of youth; only one\r\ndaughter lived to be twelve years old; I intended her for a wife for one\r\nof my nephews, but within three months I have buried her.” He sighed,\r\nwept, and was silent.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen present lifted up their hands and eyes to Heaven in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“The will of Heaven be obeyed!” said the priest. “My penitent hath\r\nconfessed all; what more would you require?”\r\n\r\n“That he make atonement,” said Sir Philip; “that he surrender the title\r\nand estate to the right heir, and dispose of his own proper fortune to\r\nhis nearest relations, and resign himself to penitence and preparation\r\nfor a future state. For this time I leave him with you, father, and will\r\njoin my prayers with yours for his repentance.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he left the room, and was followed by the Barons and the\r\nsurgeon; the priest alone remaining with him. As soon as they were out\r\nof hearing, Sir Philip questioned the surgeon concerning his patient’s\r\nsituation; who answered, that at present he saw no signs of immediate\r\ndanger, but he could not yet pronounce that there was none.\r\n\r\n“If he were mortally wounded,” said he, “he could not be so well, nor\r\nspeak so long without faintness; and it is my opinion that he will soon\r\nrecover, if nothing happens to retard the cure.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Sir Philip, “keep this opinion from him; for I would\r\nsuffer the fear of death to operate on him until he hath performed some\r\nnecessary acts of justice. Let it only be known to these noblemen, upon\r\nwhose honour I can rely, and I trust they will approve my request to\r\nyou, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I join in it,” said Lord Clifford, “from the same motives.”\r\n\r\n“I insist upon it,” said Lord Graham; “and I can answer for my surgeon’s\r\ndiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“My lords,” said the surgeon, “you may depend on my fidelity; and,\r\nafter what I have just heard, my conscience is engaged in this noble\r\ngentleman’s behalf, and I will do every thing in my power to second your\r\nintentions.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, sir,” said Sir Philip, “and you may depend on my gratitude\r\nin return. I presume you will sit up with him to-night; if any danger\r\nshould arise, I desire to be called immediately; but, otherwise, I would\r\nsuffer him to rest quietly, that he may be prepared for the business of\r\nthe following day.”\r\n\r\n“I shall obey your directions, sir; my necessary attendance will give\r\nme a pretence not to leave him, and thus I shall hear all that passes\r\nbetween him and all that visit him.”\r\n\r\n“You will oblige me highly,” said Sir Philip, “and I shall go to rest\r\nwith confidence in your care.”\r\n\r\nThe surgeon returned to the sick man’s chamber, Sir Philip and the\r\nBarons to the company below: they supped in the great hall, with all\r\nthe gentlemen that were present at the combat. Sir Philip and his Edmund\r\nretired to their repose, being heartily fatigued; and the company staid\r\nto a late hour, commenting upon the action of the day, praising the\r\ncourage and generosity of the noble knight, and wishing a good event to\r\nhis undertaking.\r\n\r\nMost of Lord Lovel’s friends went away as soon as they saw him safely\r\nlodged, being ashamed of him, and of their appearance in his behalf;\r\nand the few that stayed were induced by their desire of a further\r\ninformation of the base action he had committed, and to justify their\r\nown characters and conduct.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Sir Philip entered into consultation with the two\r\nBarons, on the methods he should take to get Edmund received, and\r\nacknowledged, as heir of the house of Lovel. They were all of opinion,\r\nthat the criminal should be kept in fear till he had settled his\r\nworldly affairs, and they had resolved how to dispose of him. With this\r\ndetermination they entered his room, and enquired of the surgeon how he\r\nhad passed the night. He shook his head, and said but little.\r\n\r\nLord Lovel desired that he might be removed to his own house. Lord\r\nGraham said, he could not consent to that, as there was evident danger\r\nin removing him; and appealed to the surgeon, who confirmed his opinion.\r\nLord Graham desired he would make himself easy, and that he should have\r\nevery kind of assistance there.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then proposed to send for the Lord Fitz-Owen, who would see\r\nthat all possible care was taken of his brother-in-law, and would assist\r\nhim in settling his affairs. Lord Lovel was against it; he was peevish\r\nand uneasy, and desired to be left with only his own servants to attend\r\nhim. Sir Philip quitted the room with a significant look; and the two\r\nLords endeavoured to reconcile him to his situation. He interrupted\r\nthem. “It is easy for men in your situation to advise, but it is\r\ndifficult for one in mine to practise; wounded in body and mind, it\r\nis natural that I should strive to avoid the extremes of shame and\r\npunishment; I thank you for your kind offices, and beg I may be left\r\nwith my own servants.”\r\n\r\n“With them, and the surgeon, you shall,” said Lord Graham; and they both\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nSir Philip met them below. “My lords,” said he, “I am desirous that my\r\nLord Fitz-Owen should be sent for, and that he may hear his brother’s\r\nconfession; for I suspect that he may hereafter deny, what only the fear\r\nof death has extorted from him; with your permission I am determined to\r\nsend messengers to-day.”\r\n\r\nThey both expressed approbation, and Lord Clifford proposed to write\r\nto him, saying, a letter from an impartial person will have the more\r\nweight; I will send one of my principal domestics with your own. This\r\nmeasure being resolved upon, Lord Clifford retired to write, and Sir\r\nPhilip to prepare his servants for instant departure. Edmund desired\r\nleave to write to father Oswald, and John Wyatt was ordered to be the\r\nbearer of his letter. When the Lord Clifford had finished his letter, he\r\nread it to Sir Philip and his chosen friends, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“RIGHT HON. MY GOOD LORD,--I have taken upon me to acquaint your\r\nLordship, that there has been a solemn combat at arms between your\r\nbrother-in-law, the Lord Lovel, and Sir Philip Harclay, Knt. of\r\nYorkshire. It was fought in the jurisdiction of the Lord Graham, who,\r\nwith myself, was appointed judge of the field; it was fairly won, and\r\nSir Philip is the conqueror. After he had gained the victory he declared\r\nat large the cause of the quarrel, and that he had revenged the death\r\nof Arthur Lord Lovel his friend, whom the present Lord Lovel had\r\nassassinated, that he might enjoy his title and estate. The wounded man\r\nconfessed the fact; and Sir Philip gave him his life, and only carried\r\noff his sword as a trophy of his victory. Both the victor and the\r\nvanquished were conveyed to Lord Graham’s castle, where the Lord Lovel\r\nnow lies in great danger. He is desirous to settle his worldly affairs,\r\nand to make his peace with God and man. Sir Philip Harclay says there\r\nis a male heir of the house of Lovel, for whom he claims the title and\r\nestate; but he is very desirous that your Lordship should be present at\r\nthe disposal of your brother’s property that of right belongs to him,\r\nof which your children are the undoubted heirs. He also wants to consult\r\nyou in many other points of honour and equity. Let me intreat you, on\r\nthe receipt of this letter, to set out immediately for Lord Graham’s\r\ncastle, where you will be received with the utmost respect and\r\nhospitality. You will hear things that will surprise you as much as they\r\ndo me; you will judge of them with that justice and honour that speaks\r\nyour character; and you will unite with us in wondering at the ways of\r\nProvidence, and submitting to its decrees, in punishing the guilty, and\r\ndoing justice to the innocent and oppressed. My best wishes and prayers\r\nattend you and your hopeful family. My lord, I remain your humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n“CLIFFORD.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one present expressed the highest approbation of this letter.\r\nSir Philip gave orders to John Wyatt to be very circumspect in his\r\nbehaviour, to give Edmund’s letter privately to father Oswald, and to\r\nmake no mention of him, or his pretensions to Lovel Castle.\r\n\r\nLord Clifford gave his servant the requisite precautions. Lord Graham\r\nadded a note of invitation, and sent it by a servant of his own. As soon\r\nas all things were ready, the messengers set out with all speed for the\r\nCastle of Lovel.\r\n\r\nThey stayed no longer by the way than to take some refreshment, but rode\r\nnight and day till they arrived there.\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen was in the parlour with his children; Father Oswald was\r\nwalking in the avenue before the house, when he saw three messengers\r\nwhose horses seemed jaded, and the riders fatigued, like men come a long\r\njourney. He came up, just as the first had delivered his message to the\r\nporter. John Wyatt knew him; he dismounted, and made signs that he had\r\nsomething to say to him; he retired back a few steps, and John, with\r\ngreat dexterity, slipped a letter into his hand. The father gave him his\r\nblessing, and a welcome.\r\n\r\n“Who do you come from?” said he aloud.\r\n\r\n“From the Lords Graham and Clifford to the Lord Fitz-Owen; and we bring\r\nletters of consequence to the Baron.”\r\n\r\nOswald followed the messengers into the hall; a servant announced their\r\narrival. Lord Fitz-Owen received them in the parlour; Lord Clifford’s\r\nservant delivered his master’s letter, Lord Graham’s his, and they said\r\nthey would retire and wait his Lordship’s answer. The Baron ordered them\r\nsome refreshment. They retired, and he opened his letters. He read them\r\nwith great agitations, he struck his hand upon his heart, he exclaimed,\r\n“My fears are all verified! the blow is struck, and it has fallen upon\r\nthe guilty!”\r\n\r\nOswald came in a minute after.\r\n\r\n“You are come in good time,” said the Baron. “Read that letter, that my\r\nchildren may know the contents.”\r\n\r\nHe read it, with faultering voice, and trembling limbs. They were all\r\nin great surprise. William looked down, and kept a studied silence. Sir\r\nRobert exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“Is it possible? can my uncle be guilty of such an action?”\r\n\r\n“You hear,” said the Baron, “he has confessed it!”\r\n\r\n“But to whom?” said Sir Robert.\r\n\r\nHis father replied, “Lord Clifford’s honour is unquestionable, and I\r\ncannot doubt what he affirms.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert leaned his head upon his hand, as one lost in thought; at\r\nlength he seemed to awake.\r\n\r\n“My Lord, I have no doubt that Edmund is at the bottom of this business.\r\nDo you not remember that Sir Philip Harclay long ago promised him his\r\nfriendship? Edmund disappears; and, soon after, this man challenges my\r\nUncle. You know what passed here before his departure; He has suggested\r\nthis affair to Sir Philip, and instigated him to this action. This is\r\nthe return he has made for the favours he has received from our family,\r\nto which he owes every thing!”\r\n\r\n“Softly, my son!” said the Baron; “let us be cautious of reflecting upon\r\nEdmund; there is a greater hand in this business. My conjecture was too\r\ntrue; It was in that fatal apartment that he was made acquainted with\r\nthe circumstances of Lord Lovel’s death; he was, perhaps, enjoined to\r\nreveal them to Sir Philip Harclay, the bosom friend of the deceased.\r\nThe mystery of that apartment is disclosed, the woe to the guilty is\r\naccomplished! There is no reflection upon any one; Heaven effects its\r\npurposes in its own time and manner. I and mine are innocent; let us\r\nworship, and be silent!”\r\n\r\n“But what do you propose to do?” said Sir Robert.\r\n\r\n“To return with the messengers,” answered the Baron. “I think it highly\r\nproper that I should see your Uncle, and hear what he has to say; my\r\nchildren are his heirs; in justice to them, I ought to be acquainted\r\nwith every thing that concerns the disposal of his fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship is in the right,” answered Sir Robert, “it concerns us\r\nall. I have only to ask your permission to bear you company.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” said the Baron; “I have only to ask of you in\r\nreturn, that you will command yourself, and not speak your mind hastily;\r\nwait for the proofs before you give judgment, and take advice of your\r\nreason before you decide upon any thing; if you reflect upon the past,\r\nyou will find reason to distrust yourself. Leave all to me, and be\r\nassured I will protect your honour and my own.”\r\n\r\n“I will obey you in all things, my lord; and will make immediate\r\npreparation for our departure.” So saying, he left the room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, Mr. William broke silence.\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said he, “if you have no great objection, I beg leave also to\r\naccompany you both.”\r\n\r\n“You shall, my son, if you desire it; I think I can see your motives,\r\nand your brother’s also; your coolness will be a good balance to his\r\nwarmth; you shall go with us. My son Walter shall be his sister’s\r\nprotector in our absence, and he shall be master here till we return.”\r\n\r\n“I hope, my dear father, that will not be long; I shall not be happy\r\ntill you come home,” said the fair Emma.\r\n\r\n“It shall be no longer, my dearest, than till this untoward affair is\r\nsettled.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron desired to know when the messengers were expected to return.\r\nOswald took this opportunity to retire; he went to his own apartment,\r\nand read the letter, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The Heir of Lovel, to his dear and reverend friend, father Oswald.\r\n\r\n“Let my friends at the Castle of Lovel know that I live in hopes one day\r\nto see them there. If you could by any means return with the messengers,\r\nyour testimony would add weight to mine; perhaps you might obtain\r\npermission to attend the Baron; I leave it to you to manage this. John\r\nWyatt will inform you of all that has passed here, and that hitherto my\r\nsuccess has outrun my expectation, and, almost, my wishes. I am in the\r\nhigh road to my inheritance; and trust that the Power who hath conducted\r\nme thus far, will not leave his work unfinished. Tell my beloved\r\nWilliam, that I live, and hope to embrace him before long. I recommend\r\nmyself to your holy prayers and blessing, and remain your son and\r\nservant, Edmund.”\r\n\r\nOswald then went to the messengers; he drew John Wyatt to a distance\r\nfrom the rest, and got the information he wanted. He stayed with\r\nhim till he was sent for by the Baron, to whom he went directly, and\r\nprevented his questions, by saying, “I have been talking with the\r\nmessengers; I find they have travelled night and day to bring the\r\nletters with all speed; they only require one night’s rest, and will be\r\nready to set out with you to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis well,” said the Baron; “we will set out as soon as they are\r\nready.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said Oswald, “I have a favour to beg of you; it is, that I\r\nmay attend you; I have seen the progress of this wonderful discovery,\r\nand I have a great desire to see the conclusion of it; perhaps my\r\npresence may be of service in the course of your business.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it may,” said the Baron; “I have no objection, if you desire to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\nThey then separated, and went to prepare for their journey.\r\n\r\nOswald had a private interview with Joseph, whom he informed of all that\r\nhe knew, and his resolution to attend the Baron in his journey to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n“I go,” said he, “to bear witness in behalf of injured innocence. If it\r\nbe needful, I shall call upon you; therefore hold yourself in readiness\r\nin case you should be sent for.”\r\n\r\n“That I will,” said Joseph, “and spend my last remains of life and\r\nstrength, to help my young lord to his right and title. But do they not\r\nbegin to suspect who is the heir of Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” said Oswald; “they think him concerned in the\r\ndiscovery, but have no idea of his being interested in the event.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, father!” said Joseph, “I shall think every day a week till your\r\nreturn; but I will no longer keep you from your repose.”\r\n\r\n“Good night,” said Oswald; “but I have another visit to pay before I go\r\nto rest.”\r\n\r\nHe left Joseph, and went on tip-toe to Mr. William’s room, and tapped at\r\nhis door. He came and opened it. “What news, father?”\r\n\r\n“Not much; I have only orders to tell you that Edmund is well, and as\r\nmuch your friend as ever.”\r\n\r\n“I guessed,” said William, “that we should hear something of him. I have\r\nstill another guess.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, my child?”\r\n\r\n“That we shall see or hear of him where we are going.”\r\n\r\n“It is very likely,” said Oswald; “and I would have you be prepared for\r\nit;--I am confident we shall hear nothing to his discredit.”\r\n\r\n“I am certain of that,” said William, “and I shall rejoice to see him; I\r\nconclude that he is under the protection of Sir Philip Harclay.”\r\n\r\n“He is so,” said Oswald; “I had my information from Sir Philip’s\r\nservant, who is one of the messengers, and was guide to the others in\r\ntheir way hither.”\r\n\r\nAfter some farther conversation they separated, and each went to his\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the whole party set out on their journey; they\r\ntravelled by easy stages on account of the Baron’s health, which began\r\nto be impaired, and arrived in health and spirits at the castle of Lord\r\nGraham, where they were received with the utmost respect and kindness by\r\nthe noble master.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Lovel had recovered his health and strength as much as possible\r\nin the time, and was impatient to be gone from thence to his own house.\r\nHe was surprised to hear of the arrival of his brother and nephews, and\r\nexpressed no pleasure at the thoughts of seeing them. When Sir Philip\r\nHarclay came to pay his respects to Baron Fitz-Owen, the latter received\r\nhim with civility, but with a coldness that was apparent. Sir Robert\r\nleft the room, doubting his resolution. Sir Philip advanced, and took\r\nthe Baron by the hand.\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said he, “I rejoice to see you here. I cannot be satisfied\r\nwith the bare civilities of such a man as you. I aspire to your esteem,\r\nto your friendship, and I shall not be happy till I obtain them. I will\r\nmake you the judge of every part of my conduct, and where you shall\r\ncondemn me, I will condemn myself.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron was softened, his noble heart felt its alliance with its\r\ncounterpart, but he thought the situation of his brother demanded some\r\nreserve towards the man who sought his life; but, in spite of himself,\r\nit wore off every moment. Lord Clifford related all that had passed,\r\nwith the due regard to Sir Philip’s honour; he remarked how nobly he\r\nconcealed the cause of his resentment against the Lord Lovel till the\r\nday of combat, that he might not prepossess the judges against him. He\r\nenlarged on his humanity to the vanquished, on the desire he expressed\r\nto have justice done to his heirs; finally, he mentioned his great\r\nrespect for the Lord Fitz-Owen, and the solicitude he shewed to have\r\nhim come to settle the estate of the sick man in favour of his children.\r\nLord Clifford also employed his son to soften Sir Robert, and to explain\r\nto him every doubtful part of Sir Philip’s behaviour.\r\n\r\nAfter the travellers had taken some rest, the Lord Graham proposed that\r\nthey should make a visit to the sick man’s chamber. The lords sent\r\nto acquaint him they were coming to visit him, and they followed the\r\nmessenger. The Lord Fitz-Owen went up to the bedside; he embraced his\r\nbrother with strong emotions of concern. Sir Robert followed him; then\r\nMr. William.\r\n\r\nLord Lovel embraced them, but said nothing; his countenance shewed his\r\ninward agitations. “Lord Fitz-Owen first broke silence.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said he, “I see my brother better than I expected?”\r\n\r\nLord Lovel bit his fingers, he pulled the bed-clothes, he seemed almost\r\ndistracted; at length he broke out--\r\n\r\n“I owe no thanks to those who sent for my relations! Sir Philip Harclay,\r\nyou have used ungenerously the advantage you have gained over me! you\r\nspared my life, only to take away my reputation. You have exposed me to\r\nstrangers, and, what is worse, to my dearest friends; when I lay in\r\na state of danger, you obliged me to say any thing, and now you take\r\nadvantage of it, to ruin me in my friends’ affection. But, if I recover,\r\nyou may repent it!”\r\n\r\nSir Philip then came forward.\r\n\r\n“My Lords, I shall take no notice of what this unhappy man has just now\r\nsaid; I shall appeal to you, as to the honourable witnesses of all that\r\nhas passed; you see it was no more than necessary. I appeal to you for\r\nthe motives of my treatment of him, before, at, and after our meeting.\r\nI did not take his life, as I might have done; I wished him to repent of\r\nhis sins, and to make restitution of what he unjustly possesses. I was\r\ncalled out to do an act of justice; I had taken the heir of Lovel under\r\nmy protection, my chief view was to see justice done to him;--what\r\nregarded this man was but a secondary motive. This was my end, and I\r\nwill never, never lose sight of it.”\r\n\r\nLord Lovel seemed almost choaked with passion, to see every one giving\r\nsome mark of approbation and respect to Sir Philip. He called out--\r\n\r\n“I demand to know who is this pretended heir, whom he brings out to\r\nclaim my title and fortune?”\r\n\r\n“My noble auditors,” said Sir Philip, “I shall appeal to your\r\njudgment, in regard to the proofs of my ward’s birth and family; every\r\ncircumstance shall be laid before you, and you shall decide upon them.\r\n\r\n“Here is a young man, supposed the son of a peasant, who, by a train\r\nof circumstances that could not have happened by human contrivance,\r\ndiscovers not only who were his real parents, but that they came to\r\nuntimely deaths. He even discovers the different places where their\r\nbones are buried, both out of consecrated ground, and appeals to their\r\nashes for the truth of his pretensions. He has also living proofs to\r\noffer, that will convince the most incredulous. I have deferred entering\r\ninto particulars, till the arrival of Baron Fitz-Owen. I know his\r\nnoble heart and honourable character, from one that has long been an\r\neye-witness of his goodness; such is the opinion I have of his justice,\r\nthat I will accept him as one of the judges in his brother’s cause.\r\nI and my ward will bring our proofs before him, and the company here\r\npresent; in the course of them, it will appear that he is the best\r\nqualified of any to judge of them, because he can ascertain many of\r\nthe facts we shall have occasion to mention. I will rest our cause upon\r\ntheir decision.”\r\n\r\nLord Graham applauded Sir Philip’s appeal, affirming his own\r\nimpartiality, and calling upon Lord Clifford and his son, and also his\r\nown nephews who were present. Lord Clifford said--\r\n\r\n“Sir Philip offers fairly, and like himself; there can be no place nor\r\npersons more impartial than the present, and I presume the Lord Lovel\r\ncan have no objection.”\r\n\r\n“No objection!” answered he; “what, to be tried like a criminal, to have\r\njudges appointed over me, to decide upon my right to my own estate and\r\ntitle? I will not submit to such a jurisdiction!”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Sir Philip, “you had rather be tried by the laws of the\r\nland, and have them pronounce sentence upon you? Take your choice, sir;\r\nif you refuse the one, you shall be certain of the other.”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford then said--“You will allow Lord Lovel to consider of\r\nthe proposal; he will consult his friends, and be determined by their\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen said--“I am very much surprised at what I have heard. I\r\nshould be glad to know all that Sir Philip Harclay has to say for his\r\nward, that I may judge what my brother has to hope or fear; I will then\r\ngive my best advice, or offer my mediation, as he may stand in need of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“You say well,” replied Lord Graham, “and pray let us come directly to\r\nthe point; Sir Philip, you will introduce your ward to this company, and\r\nenter upon your proofs.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip bowed to the company; he went out and brought in Edmund,\r\nencouraging him by the way; he presented him to Baron Fitz-Owen, who\r\nlooked very serious.\r\n\r\n“Edmund Twyford,” said he, “are you the heir of the house of Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“I am, my Lord,” said Edmund, bowing to the ground; “the proofs will\r\nappear; but I am, at the same time, the most humble and grateful of all\r\nyour servants, and the servant of your virtues.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert rose up, and was going to leave the room.\r\n\r\n“Son Robert, stay,” said the Baron; “if there is any fraud, you will be\r\npleased to detect it, and, if all that is affirmed be true, you will not\r\nshut your eyes against the light; you are concerned in this business;\r\nhear it in silence, and let reason be arbiter in your cause.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed to his father, bit his lip, and retired to the window. William\r\nnodded to Edmund, and was silent. All the company had their eyes fixed\r\non the young man, who stood in the midst, casting down his eyes with\r\nmodest respect to the audience; while Sir Philip related all the\r\nmaterial circumstances of his life, the wonderful gradation by which\r\nhe came to the knowledge of his birth, the adventures of the haunted\r\napartment, the discovery of the fatal closet, and the presumptive proofs\r\nthat Lord Lovel was buried there. At this part of his narration, Lord\r\nFitz-Owen interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“Where is this closet you talk of? for I and my sons went over the\r\napartment since Edmund’s departure, and found no such place as you\r\ndescribe.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” said Edmund, “I can account for it: the door is covered with\r\ntapestry, the same as the room, and you might easily overlook it; but I\r\nhave a witness here,” said he, and putting his hand into his bosom,\r\nhe drew out the key. “If this is not the key of that closet, let me\r\nbe deemed an impostor, and all I say a falsehood; I will risk my\r\npretensions upon this proof.”\r\n\r\n“And for what purpose did you take it away?” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“To prevent any person from going into it,” replied Edmund; “I have\r\nvowed to keep it till I shall open that closet before witnesses\r\nappointed for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed, sir,” said the Baron Fitz-Owen.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then related the conversation between Edmund and Margery\r\nTwyford, his supposed mother.\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen seemed in the utmost surprise. He exclaimed, “Can this be\r\ntrue? strange discovery! unfortunate child!”\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund’s tears bore witness to his veracity. He was obliged to hide\r\nhis face, he lifted up his clasped hands to heaven, and was in great\r\nemotions during all this part of the relation; while Lord Lovel groaned,\r\nand seemed in great agitation.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then addressed himself to Lord Fitz-Owen.\r\n\r\n“My Lord, there was another person present at the conversation between\r\nEdmund and his foster-mother, who can witness to all that passed;\r\nperhaps your lordship can tell who that was?”\r\n\r\n“It was father Oswald,” replied the Baron; “I well remember that he went\r\nwith him at his request; let him be called in.”\r\n\r\nHe was sent for, and came immediately. The Baron desired him to relate\r\nall that passed between Edmund and his mother.\r\n\r\nOswald then began--\r\n\r\n“Since I am now properly called upon to testify what I know concerning\r\nthis young man, I will speak the truth, without fear or favour of any\r\none; and I will swear, by the rules of my holy order, to the truth of\r\nwhat I shall relate.”\r\n\r\nHe then gave a particular account of all that passed on that occasion,\r\nand mentioned the tokens found on both the infant and his mother.\r\n\r\n“Where are these tokens to be seen?” said the Lord Clifford.\r\n\r\n“I have them here, my lord,” said Edmund, “and I keep them as my\r\ngreatest treasures.”\r\n\r\nHe then produced them before all the company.\r\n\r\n“There is no appearance of any fraud or collusion,” said Lord Graham;\r\n“if any man thinks he sees any, let him speak.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, my lord, suffer me to speak a word,” said Sir Robert. “Do you\r\nremember that I hinted my suspicions concerning father Oswald, the night\r\nour kinsmen lay in the east apartment?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, it now appears that he did know more than he would tell us;\r\nyou find he is very deep in all Edmund’s secrets, and you may judge what\r\nwere his motives for undertaking this journey.”\r\n\r\n“I observe what you say,” answered his father, “but let us hear all that\r\nOswald has to say; I will be as impartial as possible.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” returned Oswald, “I beg you also to recollect what I said, on\r\nthe night your son speaks of, concerning secrecy in certain matters.”\r\n\r\n“I remember that also,” said the Baron; “but proceed.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” continued Oswald, “I knew more than I thought myself at\r\nliberty to disclose at that time; but I will now tell you every thing.\r\nI saw there was something more than common in the accidents that\r\nbefell this young man, and in his being called out to sleep in the east\r\napartment; I earnestly desired him to let me be with him on the second\r\nnight, to which he consented reluctantly; we heard a great noise in the\r\nrooms underneath, we went down stairs together; I saw him open the fatal\r\ncloset, I heard groans that pierced me to the heart, I kneeled down and\r\nprayed for the repose of the spirit departed; I found a seal, with the\r\narms of Lovel engraven upon it, which I gave to Edmund, and he now has\r\nit in his possession. He enjoined me to keep secret what I had seen and\r\nheard, till the time should come to declare it. I conceived that I\r\nwas called to be a witness of these things; besides, my curiosity was\r\nexcited to know the event; I, therefore, desired to be present at\r\nthe interview between him and his mother, which was affecting beyond\r\nexpression. I heard what I have now declared as nearly as my memory\r\npermits me. I hope no impartial person will blame me for any part of my\r\nconduct; but if they should, I do not repent it. If I should forfeit the\r\nfavour of the rich and great, I shall have acquitted myself to God and\r\nmy conscience. I have no worldly ends to answer; I plead the cause of\r\nthe injured orphan; and I think, also, that I second the designs of\r\nProvidence.”\r\n\r\n“You have well spoken, father,” said the Lord Clifford; “your testimony\r\nis indeed of consequence.\r\n\r\n“It is amazing and convincing,” said Lord Graham; “and the whole story\r\nis so well connected, that I can see nothing to make us doubt the truth\r\nof it; but let us examine the proofs.”\r\n\r\nEdmund gave into their hands the necklace and earrings; he showed them\r\nthe locket with the cypher of Lovel, and the seal with the arms; he\r\ntold them the cloak, in which he was wrapped, was in the custody of\r\nhis foster-mother, who would produce it on demand. He begged that some\r\nproper persons might be commissioned to go with him to examine whether\r\nor no the bodies of his parents were buried where he affirmed; adding,\r\nthat he put his pretensions into their hands with pleasure, relying\r\nentirely upon their honour and justice.\r\n\r\nDuring this interesting scene, the criminal covered his face, and was\r\nsilent; but he sent forth bitter sighs and groans that denoted the\r\nanguish of his heart. At length, Lord Graham, in compassion to him,\r\nproposed that they should retire and consider of the proofs; adding,\r\n“Lord Lovel must needs be fatigued; we will resume the subject in his\r\npresence, when he is disposed to receive us.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay approached the bed; “Sir,” said he, “I now leave you\r\nin the hands of your own relations; they are men of strict honour, and I\r\nconfide in them to take care of you and of your concerns.”\r\n\r\nThey then went out of the room, leaving only the Lord Fitz-Owen and\r\nhis sons with the criminal. They discoursed of the wonderful story of\r\nEdmund’s birth, and the principal events of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Sir Philip requested another conference with the Lords,\r\nand their principal friends. There were present also Father Oswald,\r\nand Lord Graham’s confessor, who had taken the Lord Lovel’s confession,\r\nEdmund, and Zadisky. “Now, gentlemen,” said Sir Philip, “I desire to\r\nknow your opinion of our proofs, and your advice upon them.”\r\n\r\nLord Graham replied, “I am desired to speak for the rest. We think there\r\nare strong presumptive proofs that this young man is the true heir of\r\nLovel; but they ought to be confirmed and authenticated. Of the murder\r\nof the late Lord there is no doubt; the criminal hath confessed it, and\r\nthe circumstances confirm it; the proofs of his crime are so connected\r\nwith those of the young man’s birth, that one cannot be public without\r\nthe other. We are desirous to do justice; and yet are unwilling, for\r\nthe Lord Fitz-Owen’s sake, to bring the criminal to public shame and\r\npunishment. We wish to find out a medium; we therefore desire Sir\r\nPhilip to make proposals for his ward, and let Lord Fitz-Owen answer for\r\nhimself and his brother, and we will be moderators between them.”\r\n\r\nHere every one expressed approbation, and called upon Sir Philip to make\r\nhis demands.\r\n\r\n“If,” said he, “I were to demand strict justice, I should not be\r\nsatisfied with any thing less than the life of the criminal; but I am a\r\nChristian soldier, the disciple of Him who came into the world to save\r\nsinners;--for His sake,” continued he, crossing himself, “I forego my\r\nrevenge, I spare the guilty. If Heaven gives him time for repentance,\r\nman should not deny it. It is my ward’s particular request, that I will\r\nnot bring shame upon the house of his benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen,\r\nfor whom he hath a filial affection and profound veneration. My\r\nproposals are these:--First, that the criminal make restitution of the\r\ntitle and estate, obtained with so much injustice and cruelty, to the\r\nlawful heir, whom he shall acknowledge such before proper witnesses.\r\nSecondly, that he shall surrender his own lawful inheritance and\r\npersonal estate into the hands of the Lord Fitz-Owen, in trust for his\r\nsons, who are his heirs of blood. Thirdly, that he shall retire into a\r\nreligious house, or else quit the kingdom in three months time; and,\r\nin either case, those who enjoy his fortune shall allow him a decent\r\nannuity, that he may not want the comforts of life. By the last, I\r\ndisable him from the means of doing further mischief, and enable him to\r\ndevote the remainder of his days to penitence. These are my proposals,\r\nand I give him four-and-twenty hours to consider of them; if he refuses\r\nto comply with them, I shall be obliged to proceed to severer measures,\r\nand to a public prosecution. But the goodness of the Lord Fitz-Owen\r\nbids me expect, from his influence with his brother, a compliance with\r\nproposals made out of respect to his honourable character.”\r\n\r\nLord Graham applauded the humanity, prudence, and piety of Sir Philip’s\r\nproposals. He enforced them with all his influence and eloquence. Lord\r\nClifford seconded him; and the rest gave tokens of approbation.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Fitz-Owen then rose up. “I beg leave to observe to the\r\ncompany, who are going to dispose so generously of another man’s\r\nproperty, that my father purchased the castle and estate of the house of\r\nLovel; who is to repay him the money for it?”\r\n\r\nSir Philip then said, “I have also a question to ask. Who is to pay\r\nthe arrears of my ward’s estate, which he has unjustly been kept out of\r\nthese one-and-twenty years? Let Lord Clifford answer to both points, for\r\nhe is not interested in either.”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford smiled.\r\n\r\n“I think,” returned he, “the first question is answered by the second,\r\nand that the parties concerned should set one against the other,\r\nespecially as Lord Fitz-Owen’s children will inherit the fortune, which\r\nincludes the purchase-money.”\r\n\r\nLord Graham said, “This determination is both equitable and generous,\r\nand I hope will answer the expectations on all sides.”\r\n\r\n“I have another proposal to make to my Lord Fitz-Owen,” said Sir Philip;\r\n“but I first wait for the acceptance of those already made.”\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen replied, “I shall report them to my brother, and acquaint\r\nthe company with his resolution to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThey then separated; and the Baron, with his sons, returned to the\r\nsick man’s chamber; there he exhorted his brother, with the piety of a\r\nconfessor, to repent of his sins and make atonement for them. He made\r\nknown Sir Philip’s proposals, and observed on the wonderful discovery\r\nof his crime, and the punishment that followed it. “Your repentance,”\r\n continued he, “may be accepted, and your crime may yet be pardoned. If\r\nyou continue refractory, and refuse to make atonement, you will draw\r\ndown upon you a severer punishment.”\r\n\r\nThe criminal would not confess, and yet could not deny, the truth\r\nand justice of his observations. The Baron spent several hours in his\r\nbrother’s chamber. He sent for a priest, who took his confession; and\r\nthey both sat up with him all night, advising, persuading, and exhorting\r\nhim to do justice, and to comply with the proposals. He was unwilling to\r\ngive up the world, and yet more so to become the object of public shame,\r\ndisgrace, and punishment.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Lord Fitz-Owen summoned the company into his brother’s\r\nchamber, and there declared, in his name, that he accepted Sir Philip\r\nHarclay’s proposals; that, if the young man could, as he promised,\r\ndirect them to the places where his parents were buried, and if his\r\nbirth should be authenticated by his foster-parents, he should be\r\nacknowledged the heir of the house of Lovel. That to be certified of\r\nthese things, they must commission proper persons to go with him for\r\nthis purpose; and, in case the truth should be made plain, they should\r\nimmediately put him in possession of the castle and estate, in the\r\nstate it was. He desired Lord Graham and Lord Clifford to chuse the\r\ncommissioners, and gave Sir Philip and Edmund a right to add to them,\r\neach, another person. [sic]\r\n\r\nLord Graham named the eldest son of Lord Clifford, and the other, in\r\nreturn, named his nephew; they also chose the priest, Lord Graham’s\r\nconfessor, and the eldest son of Baron Fitz-Owen, to his great\r\nmortification. Sir Philip appointed Mr. William Fitz-Owen, and Edmund\r\nnamed father Oswald; they chose out the servants to attend them,\r\nwho were also to be witnesses of all that should pass. Lord Clifford\r\nproposed to Baron Fitz-Owen, that, as soon as the commissioners were\r\nset out, the remainder of the company should adjourn to his seat in\r\nCumberland, whither Lord Graham should be invited to accompany them, and\r\nto stay till this affair was decided. After some debate, this was agreed\r\nto; and, at the same time, that the criminal should be kept with them\r\ntill every thing was properly settled.\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen gave his son William the charge to receive and entertain\r\nthe commissioners at the castle; But, before they set out, Sir Philip\r\nhad a conference with Lord Fitz-Owen, concerning the surrender of the\r\ncastle; in which he insisted on the furniture and stock of the farm,\r\nin consideration of the arrears. Lord Fitz-Owen slightly mentioned the\r\nyoung man’s education and expences. Sir Philip answered, “You are right,\r\nmy Lord; I had not thought of this point; we owe you, in this respect,\r\nmore than we can ever repay. But you know not half the respect and\r\naffection Edmund bears for you. When restitution of his title and\r\nfortune are fully made, his happiness will still depend on you.”\r\n\r\n“How on me?” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“Why, he will not be happy unless you honour him with your notice and\r\nesteem; but this is not all, I must hope that you will do still more for\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the Baron, “he has put my regard for him to a severe\r\nproof; what further can he expect from me?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lord, be not offended, I have only one more proposal to make to\r\nyou; if you refuse it, I can allow for you; and I confess it requires a\r\ngreatness of mind, but not more than you possess, to grant it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, speak your demand.”\r\n\r\n“Say rather my request; it is this: Cease to look upon Edmund as the\r\nenemy of your house; look upon him as a son, and make him so indeed.”\r\n\r\n“How say you, Sir Philip? my son!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord, give him your daughter. He is already your son in filial\r\naffection; your son William and he are sworn brothers; what remains but\r\nto make him yours? He deserves such a parent, you such a son; and you\r\nwill, by this means, ingraft into your family, the name, title, and\r\nestate of Lovel, which will be entailed on your posterity for ever.”\r\n\r\n“This offer requires much consideration,” returned the Baron.\r\n\r\n“Suffer me to suggest some hints to you,” said Sir Philip. “This match\r\nis, I think, verily pointed out by Providence, which hath conducted the\r\ndear boy through so many dangers, and brought him within view of his\r\nhappiness; look on him as the precious relic of a noble house, the son\r\nof my dearest friend! or look on him as my son and heir, and let me, as\r\nhis father, implore you to consent to his marriage with your daughter.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron’s heart was touched, he turned away his face.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sir Philip Harclay, what a friend are you! why should such a man be\r\nour enemy?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Sir Philip, “we are not, cannot be enemies; our hearts\r\nare already allied; and I am certain we shall one day be dear friends.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron suppressed his emotions, but Sir Philip saw into his heart.\r\n\r\n“I must consult my eldest son,” returned he.\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied Sir Philip, “I foresee much difficulty; he is prejudiced\r\nagainst Edmund, and thinks the restitution of his inheritance an injury\r\nto your family. Hereafter he will see this alliance in a different\r\nlight, and will rejoice that such a brother is added to the family;\r\nbut, at present, he will set his face against it. However, we will not\r\ndespair; virtue and resolution will surmount all obstacles. Let me call\r\nin young Lovel.”\r\n\r\nHe brought Edmund to the Baron, and acquainted him with the proposal he\r\nhad been making in his name, my Lord’s answers, and the objections he\r\nfeared on the part of Sir Robert. Edmund kneeled to the Baron; he took\r\nhis hand and pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\n“Best of men! of parents! of patrons!” said he, “I will ever be your son\r\nin filial affection, whether I have the honour to be legally so or\r\nnot; not one of your own children can feel a stronger sense of love and\r\nduty.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said the Baron, “do you love my daughter?”\r\n\r\n“I do, my lord, with the most ardent affection; I never loved any woman\r\nbut her; and, if I am so unfortunate as to be refused her, I will not\r\nmarry at all. Oh, my Lord, reject not my honest suit! Your alliance will\r\ngive me consequence with myself, it will excite me to act worthy of the\r\nstation to which I am exalted; if you refuse me, I shall seem an abject\r\nwretch, disdained by those whom my heart claims relation to; your family\r\nare the whole world to me. Give me your lovely daughter! give me also\r\nyour son, my beloved William; and let me share with them the fortune\r\nProvidence bestows upon me. But what is title or fortune, if I am\r\ndeprived of the society of those I love?”\r\n\r\n“Edmund,” said the Baron, “you have a noble friend; but you have a\r\nstronger in my heart, which I think was implanted there by Heaven to aid\r\nits own purposes. I feel a variety of emotions of different kinds, and\r\nam afraid to trust my own heart with you. But answer me a question: Are\r\nyou assured of my daughter’s consent? have you solicited her favour?\r\nhave you gained her affections?”\r\n\r\n“Never, my lord. I am incapable of so base an action; I have loved her\r\nat an humble distance; but, in my situation, I should have thought it a\r\nviolation of all the laws of gratitude and hospitality to have presumed\r\nto speak the sentiments of my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have acted with unquestionable honour on this, and, I must\r\nsay, on all other occasions.”\r\n\r\n“Your approbation, my lord, is the first wish of my life; it is the seal\r\nof my honour and happiness.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip smiled: “My Lord Fitz-Owen, I am jealous of Edmund’s\r\npreferable regard for you; it is just the same now as formerly.”\r\n\r\nEdmund came to Sir Philip, he threw himself into his arms, he wept, he\r\nwas overpowered with the feelings of his heart; he prayed to Heaven to\r\nstrengthen his mind to support his inexpressible sensations.\r\n\r\n“I am overwhelmed with obligation,” said he; “oh, best of friends, teach\r\nme, like you, to make my actions speak for me!”\r\n\r\n“Enough, Edmund; I know your heart, and that is my security. My lord,\r\nspeak to him, and bring him to himself, by behaving coldly to him, if\r\nyou can.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron said, “I must not trust myself with you, you make a child\r\nof me. I will only add, gain my son Robert’s favour, and be assured of\r\nmine; I owe some respect to the heir of my family; he is brave, honest,\r\nand sincere; your enemies are separated from him, you have William’s\r\ninfluence in your behalf; make one effort, and let me know the result.”\r\n\r\nEdmund kissed his hand in transports of joy and gratitude.\r\n\r\n“I will not lose a moment,” said he; “I fly to obey your commands.”\r\n\r\nEdmund went immediately to his friend William, and related all that had\r\npassed between the Baron, Sir Philip, and himself. William promised him\r\nhis interest in the warmest manner; he recapitulated all that had passed\r\nin the castle since his departure; but he guarded his sister’s delicacy,\r\ntill it should be resolved to give way to his address. They both\r\nconsulted young Clifford, who had conceived an affection to Edmund for\r\nhis amiable qualities, and to William for his generous friendship for\r\nhim. He promised them his assistance, as Sir Robert seemed desirous to\r\ncultivate his friendship. Accordingly, they both attacked him with the\r\nwhole artillery of friendship and persuasion. Clifford urged the merits\r\nof Edmund, and the advantages of his alliance. William enforced his\r\narguments by a retrospect of Edmund’s past life; and observed, that\r\nevery obstacle thrown in his way had brought his enemies to shame, and\r\nincrease of honour to himself. “I say nothing,” continued he, “of his\r\nnoble qualities and affectionate heart; those who have been so many\r\nyears his companions, can want no proofs of it.”\r\n\r\n“We know your attachment to him, sir,” said Sir Robert; “and, in\r\nconsequence, your partiality.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied William, “you are sensible of the truth of my assertions;\r\nand, I am confident, would have loved him yourself, but for the\r\ninsinuations of his enemies. But if he should make good his assertions,\r\neven you must be convinced of his veracity.”\r\n\r\n“And you would have my father give him your sister upon this\r\nuncertainty?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, but upon these conditions.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose he does not make them good?”\r\n\r\n“Then I will be of your party, and give up his interest.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir; my father may do as he pleases; but I cannot agree to\r\ngive my sister to one who has always stood in the way of our family, and\r\nnow turns us out of our own house.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, brother, you see his pretensions in so wrong a light; but\r\nif you think there is any imposture in the case, go with us, and be a\r\nwitness of all that passes.”\r\n\r\n“No, not I; if Edmund is to be master of the castle, I will never more\r\nset my foot in it.”\r\n\r\n“This matter,” said Mr. Clifford, “must be left to time, which has\r\nbrought stranger things to pass. Sir Robert’s honour and good sense will\r\nenable him to subdue his prejudices, and to judge impartially.”\r\n\r\nThey took leave, and went to make preparations for their journey. Edmund\r\nmade his report of Sir Robert’s inflexibility to his father, in presence\r\nof Sir Philip; who, again, ventured to urge the Baron on his favourite\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“It becomes me to wait for the further proofs,” said he; “but, if they\r\nare as clear as I expect, I will not be inexorable to your wishes; Say\r\nnothing more on this subject till the return of the commissioners.”\r\n\r\nThey were profuse in their acknowledgments of his goodness.\r\n\r\nEdmund took a tender leave of his two paternal friends.\r\n\r\n“When,” said he, “I take possession of my inheritance, I must hope for\r\nthe company of you both to complete my happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Of me,” said Sir Philip, “you may be certain; and, as far as my\r\ninfluence reaches, of the Baron.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent. Edmund assured them of his constant prayers for their\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the commissioners, with Edmund, set out for Lovel Castle;\r\nand the following day the Lord Clifford set out for his own house, with\r\nBaron Fitz-Owen and his son. The nominal Baron was carried with them,\r\nvery much against his will. Sir Philip Harclay was invited to go with\r\nthem by Lord Clifford, who declared his presence necessary to bring\r\nthings to a conclusion. They all joined in acknowledging their\r\nobligations to Lord Graham’s generous hospitality, and besought him to\r\naccompany them. At length he consented, on condition they would allow\r\nhim to go to and fro, as his duty should call him.\r\n\r\nLord Clifford received them with the greatest hospitality, and presented\r\nthem to his lady, and three daughters, who were in the bloom of youth\r\nand beauty. They spent their time very pleasantly, excepting the\r\ncriminal, who continued gloomy and reserved, and declined company.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the commissioners proceeded on their journey. When\r\nthey were within a day’s distance from the castle, Mr. William and his\r\nservant put forward, and arrived several hours before the rest, to make\r\npreparations for their reception. His sister and brother received them\r\nwith open arms, and enquired eagerly after the event of the journey to\r\nthe North. He gave them a brief account of every thing that had happened\r\nto their uncle; adding, “But this is not all: Sir Philip Harclay has\r\nbrought a young man who he pretends is the son of the late Lord Lovel,\r\nand claims his estate and title. This person is on his journey hither,\r\nwith several others who are commissioned to enquire into certain\r\nparticulars, to confirm his pretensions. If he make good his claim, my\r\nfather will surrender the castle and estate into his hands. Sir\r\nPhilip and my lord have many points to settle; and he has proposed\r\na compromise, that you, my sister, ought to know, because it nearly\r\nconcerns you.”\r\n\r\n“Me! brother William; pray explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he proposes that, in lieu of arrears and other expectations, my\r\nfather shall give his dear Emma to the heir of Lovel, in full of all\r\ndemands.”\r\n\r\n She changed colour.\r\n\r\n“Holy Mary!” said she; “and does my father agree to this proposal?”\r\n\r\n“He is not very averse to it; but Sir Robert refuses his consent.\r\nHowever, I have given him my interest with you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you indeed? What! a stranger, perhaps an impostor, who comes to\r\nturn us out of our dwelling?”\r\n\r\n“Have patience, my Emma! see this young man without prejudice, and\r\nperhaps you will like him as well as I do.”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised at you, William.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Emma, I cannot bear to see you uneasy. Think of the man who of all\r\nothers you would with to see in a situation to ask you of your father,\r\nand expect to see your wishes realized.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” said she.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is impossible, my dear; let us be prudent, and all will end\r\nhappily. You must help me to receive and entertain these commissioners.\r\nI expect a very solemn scene; but when that is once got over, happier\r\nhours than the past will succeed. We shall first visit the haunted\r\napartment; you, my sister, will keep in your own till I shall send for\r\nyou. I go now to give orders to the servants.”\r\n\r\nHe went and ordered them to be in waiting; and himself, and his youngest\r\nbrother, stood in readiness to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the horn announced the arrival of the commissioners; at\r\nthe same instant a sudden gust of wind arose, and the outward gates flew\r\nopen. They entered the court-yard, and the great folding-doors into the\r\nhall were opened without any assistance. The moment Edmund entered the\r\nhall, every door in the house flew open; the servants all rushed into\r\nthe hall, and fear was written on their countenances; Joseph only was\r\nundaunted. “These doors,” said he, “open of their own accord to receive\r\ntheir master! this is he indeed!”\r\n\r\nEdmund was soon apprized of what had happened.\r\n\r\n“I accept the omen!” said he. “Gentlemen, let us go forward to the\r\napartment! let us finish the work of fate! I will lead the way.” He went\r\non to the apartment, followed by all present. “Open the shutters,”\r\n said he, “the daylight shall no longer be excluded here; the deeds of\r\ndarkness shall now be brought to light.”\r\n\r\nThey descended the staircase; every door was open, till they came to the\r\nfatal closet. Edmund called to Mr. William: “Approach, my friend, and\r\nbehold the door your family overlooked!”\r\n\r\nThey came forward; he drew the key out of his bosom, and unlocked the\r\ndoor; he made them observe that the boards were all loose; he then\r\ncalled to the servants, and bid them remove every thing out of the\r\ncloset. While they were doing this, Edmund shewed them the breastplate\r\nall stained with blood. He then called to Joseph:--\r\n\r\n“Do you know whose was this suit of armour?”\r\n\r\n“It was my Lord’s,” said Joseph; “the late Lord Lovel; I have seen him\r\nwear it.”\r\n\r\nEdmund bade them bring shovels and remove the earth. While they were\r\ngone, he desired Oswald to repeat all that passed the night they sat\r\nup together in that apartment, which he did till the servants returned.\r\nThey threw out the earth, while the by-standers in solemn silence waited\r\nthe event. After some time and labour they struck against something.\r\nThey proceeded till they discovered a large trunk, which with some\r\ndifficulty they drew out. It had been corded round, but the cords were\r\nrotted to dust. They opened it, and found a skeleton which appeared to\r\nhave been tied neck and heels together, and forced into the trunk.\r\n\r\n“Behold,” said Edmund, “the bones of him to whom I owe my birth!”\r\n\r\nThe priest from Lord Graham’s advanced. “This is undoubtedly the body of\r\nthe Lord Lovel; I heard his kinsman confess the manner in which he was\r\ninterred. Let this awful spectacle be a lesson to all present, that\r\nthough wickedness may triumph for a season, a day of retribution will\r\ncome!”\r\n\r\nOswald exclaimed. “Behold the day of retribution! of triumph to the\r\ninnocent, of shame and confusion to the wicked!”\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen declared that Edmund had made good his assertions.\r\n\r\n“What then,” said they, “remains?”\r\n\r\n“I propose,” said Lord Graham’s priest, “that an account be written\r\nof this discovery, and signed by all the witnesses present; that an\r\nattested copy be left in the hands of this gentleman, and the original\r\nbe sent to the Barons and Sir Philip Harclay, to convince them of the\r\ntruth of it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Clifford then desired Edmund to proceed in his own way.\r\n\r\n“The first thing I propose to do,” said he, “is to have a coffin made\r\nfor these honoured remains. I trust to find the bones of my other\r\nparent, and to inter them all together in consecrated ground.\r\nUnfortunate pair! you shall at last rest together! your son shall pay\r\nthe last duties to your ashes!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped to shed tears, and none present but paid this tribute to\r\ntheir misfortunes. Edmund recovered his voice and proceeded.\r\n\r\n“My next request is, that Father Oswald and this reverend father, with\r\nwhoever else the gentlemen shall appoint, will send for Andrew and\r\nMargery Twyford, and examine them concerning the circumstances of my\r\nbirth, and the death and burial of my unfortunate mother.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done,” said Mr. William; “but first let me intreat you to\r\ncome with me and take some refreshment after your journey, for you must\r\nbe fatigued; after dinner we will proceed in the enquiry.”\r\n\r\nThey all followed him into the great hall, where they were entertained\r\nwith great hospitality, and Mr. William did the honours in his father’s\r\nname. Edmund’s heart was deeply affected, and the solemnity of his\r\ndeportment bore witness to his sincerity; but it was a manly sorrow,\r\nthat did not make him neglect his duty to his friends or himself. He\r\nenquired after the health of the lady Emma.\r\n\r\n“She is well,” said William, “and as much your friend as ever.”\r\n\r\nEdmund bowed in silence.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the commissioners sent for Andrew and his wife. They\r\nexamined them separately, and found their accounts agreed together,\r\nand were in substance the same as Oswald and Edmund had before related,\r\nseparately also. The commissioners observed, that there could be no\r\ncollusion between them, and that the proofs were indisputable. They kept\r\nthe foster parents all night; and the next day Andrew directed them to\r\nthe place where the Lady Lovel was buried, between two trees which he\r\nhad marked for a memorial. They collected the bones and carried them\r\nto the Castle, where Edmund caused a stately coffin to be made for the\r\nremains of the unfortunate pair. The two priests obtained leave to look\r\nin the coffin buried in the church, and found nothing but stones and\r\nearth in it. The commissioners then declared they were fully satisfied\r\nof the reality of Edmund’s pretensions.\r\n\r\nThe two priests were employed in drawing up a circumstantial account of\r\nthese discoveries, in order to make their report to the Barons at their\r\nreturn. In the mean time Mr. William took an opportunity to introduce\r\nEdmund to his sister.\r\n\r\n“My Emma,” said he, “the heir of Lovel is desirous to pay his respects\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nThey were both in apparent confusion; but Edmund’s wore off, and Emma’s\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n“I have been long desirous,” said he, “to pay my respects to the lady\r\nwhom I most honour, but unavoidable duties have detained me; when these\r\nare fully paid, it is my wish to devote the remainder of my life to Lady\r\nEmma!”\r\n\r\n“Are you, then, the heir of Lovel?”\r\n\r\n“I am, madam; and am also the man in whose behalf I once presumed to\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis very strange indeed!”\r\n\r\n“It is so, madam, to myself; but time that reconciles us to all things,\r\nwill, I hope, render this change in my situation familiar to you.”\r\n\r\nWilliam said, “You are both well acquainted with the wishes of my heart;\r\nbut my advice is, that you do not encourage a farther intimacy till my\r\nlord’s determination be fully known.”\r\n\r\n“You may dispose of me as you please,” said Edmund; “but I cannot help\r\ndeclaring my wishes; yet I will submit to my Lord’s sentence, though he\r\nshould doom me to despair.”\r\n\r\nFrom this period, the young pair behaved with solemn respect to each\r\nother, but with apparent reserve. The young lady sometimes appeared in\r\ncompany, but oftener chose to be in her own apartment, where she began\r\nto believe and hope for the completion of her wishes. The uncertainty of\r\nthe Baron’s determination, threw an air of anxiety over Edmund’s face.\r\nHis friend William, by the most tender care and attention, strove to\r\ndispel his fears, and encourage his hopes; but he waited with impatience\r\nfor the return of the commissioners, and the decision of his fate.\r\n\r\nWhile these things passed at the Castle of Lovel, the nominal Baron\r\nrecovered his health and strength at the house of Lord Clifford. In\r\nthe same proportion he grew more and more shy and reserved, avoided the\r\ncompany of his brother and nephew, and was frequently shut up with his\r\ntwo servants. Sir Robert Fitz-Owen made several attempts to gain his\r\nconfidence, but in vain; he was equally shy to him as the rest.\r\nM. Zadisky observed his motions with the penetration for which his\r\ncountrymen have been distinguished in all ages; he communicated his\r\nsuspicions to Sir Philip and the Barons, giving it as his opinion, that\r\nthe criminal was meditating an escape. They asked, what he thought was\r\nto be done? Zadisky offered to watch him in turn with another person,\r\nand to lie in wait for him; he also proposed, that horses should be kept\r\nin readiness, and men to mount them, without knowledge of the service\r\nthey were to be employed in. The Barons agreed to leave the whole\r\nmanagement of this affair to Zadisky. He took his measures so well, that\r\nhe intercepted the three fugitives in the fields adjoining to the house,\r\nand brought them all back prisoner. They confined them separately, while\r\nthe Lords and Gentlemen consulted how to dispose of them.\r\n\r\nSir Philip applied to Lord Fitz-Owen, who begged leave to be silent.\r\n“I have nothing,” said he, “to offer in favour of this bad man; and I\r\ncannot propose harsher measures with so near a relation.”\r\n\r\nZadisky then begged to be heard.\r\n\r\n“You can no longer have any reliance upon the word of a man who has\r\nforfeited all pretensions to honour and sincerity. I have long wished to\r\nrevisit once more my native country, and to enquire after some very\r\ndear friends I left there. I will undertake to convey this man to a\r\nvery distant part of the world, where it will be out of his power to\r\ndo further mischief, and free his relations from an ungrateful charge,\r\nunless you should rather chuse to bring him to punishment here.”\r\n\r\nLord Clifford approved of the proposal; Lord Fitz-Owen remained silent,\r\nbut shewed no marks of disapprobation.\r\n\r\nSir Philip objected to parting with his friend; but Zadisky assured him\r\nhe had particular reasons for returning to the Holy Land, of which he\r\nshould be judge hereafter. Sir Philip desired the Lord Fitz-Owen to give\r\nhim his company to the criminal’s apartment, saying, “We will have one\r\nmore conversation with him, and that shall decide his fate.”\r\n\r\nThey found him silent and sullen, and he refused to answer their\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nSir Philip then bespoke him: “After the proofs you have given of your\r\nfalsehood and insincerity, we can no longer have any reliance upon you,\r\nnor faith in your fulfilling the conditions of our agreement; I will,\r\ntherefore, once more make you a proposal that shall still leave you\r\nindebted to our clemency. You shall banish yourself from England for\r\never, and go in pilgrimage to the Holy Land, with such companions as we\r\nshall appoint; or, secondly, you shall enter directly into a monastery,\r\nand there be shut up for life; or, thirdly, if you refuse both these\r\noffers, I will go directly to court, throw myself at the feet of my\r\nSovereign, relate the whole story of your wicked life and actions, and\r\ndemand vengeance on your head. The King is too good and pious to let\r\nsuch villany go unpunished; he will bring you to public shame and\r\npunishment; and be you assured, if I begin this prosecution, I will\r\npursue it to the utmost. I appeal to your worthy brother for the\r\njustice of my proceeding. I reason no more with you, I only declare my\r\nresolution. I wait your answer one hour, and the next I put in execution\r\nwhatever you shall oblige me to determine.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, they retired, and left him to reflect and to resolve. At\r\nthe expiration of the hour they sent Zadisky to receive his answer;\r\nhe insinuated to him the generosity and charity of Sir Philip and the\r\nLords, and the certainty of their resolutions, and begged him to take\r\ncare what answer he returned, for that his fate depended on it. He\r\nkept silent several minutes, resentment and despair were painted on his\r\nvisage. At length he spoke:--\r\n\r\n“Tell my proud enemies that I prefer banishment to death, infamy, or a\r\nlife of solitude.”\r\n\r\n“You have chosen well,” said Zadisky. “To a wise man all countries are\r\nalike; it shall be my care to make mine agreeable to you.”\r\n\r\n“Are you, then, the person chosen for my companion?”\r\n\r\n“I am, sir; and you may judge by that circumstance, that those whom you\r\ncall your enemies, are not so in effect. Farewell, sir--I go to prepare\r\nfor our departure.”\r\n\r\nZadisky went and made his report, and then set immediately about his\r\npreparations. He chose two active young men for his attendants; and gave\r\nthem directions to keep a strict eye upon their charge, for that they\r\nshould be accountable if he should escape them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Baron Fitz-Owen had several conferences with his\r\nbrother; he endeavoured to make him sensible of his crimes, and of the\r\njustice and clemency of his conqueror; but he was moody and reserved\r\nto him as to the rest. Sir Philip Harclay obliged him to surrender his\r\nworldly estates into the hands of Lord Fitz-Owen. A writing was drawn\r\nup for that purpose, and executed in the presence of them all. Lord\r\nFitz-Owen engaged to allow him an annual sum, and to advance money for\r\nthe expences of his voyage. He spoke to him in the most affectionate\r\nmanner, but he refused his embrace.\r\n\r\n“You will have nothing to regret,” said he, haughtily, “for the gain is\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip conjured Zadisky to return to him again, who answered:\r\n\r\n“I will either return, or give such reasons for my stay, as you shall\r\napprove. I will send a messenger to acquaint you with my arrival in\r\nSyria, and with such other particulars as I shall judge interesting to\r\nyou and yours. In the meantime remember me in your prayers, and preserve\r\nfor me those sentiments of friendship and esteem, that I have always\r\ndeemed one of the chief honours and blessings of my life. Commend my\r\nlove and duty to your adopted son; he will more than supply my absence,\r\nand be the comfort of your old age. Adieu, best and noblest of friends!”\r\n\r\nThey took a tender leave of each other, not without tears on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe travellers set out directly for a distant seaport where they heard\r\nof a ship bound for the Levant, in which they embarked and proceeded on\r\ntheir voyage.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners arrived at Lord Clifford’s a few days after the\r\ndeparture of the adventurers. They gave a minute account of their\r\ncommission, and expressed themselves entirely satisfied of the justice\r\nof Edmund’s pretensions; they gave an account in writing of all that\r\nthey had been eyewitnesses to, and ventured to urge the Baron Fitz-Owen\r\non the subject of Edmund’s wishes. The Baron was already disposed in his\r\nfavour; his mind was employed in the future establishment of his family.\r\nDuring their residence at Lord Clifford’s, his eldest son Sir Robert had\r\ncast his eye upon the eldest daughter of that nobleman, and he besought\r\nhis father to ask her in marriage for him. The Baron was pleased with\r\nthe alliance, and took the first opportunity to mention it to Lord\r\nClifford; who answered him, pleasantly:\r\n\r\n\r\n“I will give my daughter to your son, upon condition that you will give\r\nyours to the Heir of Lovel.” The Baron looked serious; Lord Clifford\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n“I like that young man so well, that I would accept him for a\r\nson-in-law, if he asked me for my daughter; and if I have any influence\r\nwith you, I will use it in his behalf.”\r\n\r\n“A powerful solicitor indeed!” said the Baron; “but you know my eldest\r\nson’s reluctance to it; if he consents, so will I.”\r\n\r\n“He shall consent,” said Lord Clifford, “or he shall have no daughter\r\nof mine. Let him subdue his prejudices, and then I will lay aside my\r\nscruples.”\r\n\r\n“But, my Lord,” replied the Baron, “if I can obtain his free consent,\r\nit will be the best for all; I will try once more, and if he will not, I\r\nwill leave it wholly to your management.”\r\n\r\nWhen the noble company were all assembled, Sir Philip Harclay revived\r\nthe subject, and besought the Lord Fitz-Owen to put an end to the work\r\nhe had begun, by confirming Edmund’s happiness. The Baron rose up, and\r\nthus spoke:\r\n\r\n“The proofs of Edmund’s noble birth, the still stronger ones of his\r\nexcellent endowments and qualities, the solicitations of so many noble\r\nfriends in his behalf, have altogether determined me in his favour;\r\nand I hope to do justice to his merit, without detriment to my other\r\nchildren; I am resolved to make them all as happy as my power will\r\nallow me to do. Lord Clifford has been so gracious to promise his fair\r\ndaughter to my son Robert, upon certain conditions, that I will take\r\nupon me to ratify, and which will render my son worthy of the happiness\r\nthat awaits him. My children are the undoubted heirs of my unhappy\r\nbrother, Lovel; you, my son, shall therefore immediately take possession\r\nof your uncle’s house and estate, only obliging you to pay to each\r\nof your younger brothers, the sum of one thousand pounds; on this\r\ncondition, I will secure that estate to you and your heirs for ever. I\r\nwill by my own act and deed surrender the castle and estate of Lovel to\r\nthe right owner, and at the same time marry him to my daughter. I will\r\nsettle a proper allowance upon my two younger sons, and dispose of\r\nwhat remains by a will and testament; and then I shall have done all my\r\nbusiness in this world, and shall have nothing to do but prepare for the\r\nnext.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my father!” said Sir Robert, “I cannot bear your generosity! you\r\nwould give away all to others, and reserve nothing for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, my son,” said the Baron; “I will repair my old castle in Wales,\r\nand reside there. I will visit my children, and be visited by them; I\r\nwill enjoy their happiness, and by that means increase my own; whether I\r\nlook backwards or forwards, I shall have nothing to do but rejoice, and\r\nbe thankful to Heaven that has given me so many blessings; I shall have\r\nthe comfortable reflection of having discharged my duties as a citizen,\r\na husband, a father, a friend; and, whenever I am summoned away from\r\nthis world, I shall die content.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert came forward with tears on his cheeks; he kneeled to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“Best of parents, and of men!” said he; “you have subdued a heart that\r\nhas been too refractory to your will; you have this day made me sensible\r\nhow much I owe to your goodness and forbearance with me. Forgive me all\r\nthat is past, and from henceforward dispose of me; I will have no will\r\nbut yours, no ambition but to be worthy of the name of your son.”\r\n\r\n“And this day,” said the Baron, “do I enjoy the true happiness of a\r\nfather! Rise, my son, and take possession of the first place in my\r\naffection without reserve.” They embraced with tears on both sides; The\r\ncompany rose, and congratulated both father and son. The Baron presented\r\nhis son to Lord Clifford, who embraced him, and said:\r\n\r\n“You shall have my daughter, for I see that you deserve her.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay approached--the Baron gave his son’s hand to the\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n“Love and respect that good man,” said he; “deserve his friendship, and\r\nyou will obtain it.”\r\n\r\nNothing but congratulations were heard on all sides.\r\n\r\nWhen their joy was in some degree reduced to composure, Sir Philip\r\nproposed that they should begin to execute the schemes of happiness they\r\nhad planned. He proposed that my Lord Fitz-Owen should go with him to\r\nthe Castle of Lovel, and settle the family there. The Baron consented;\r\nand both together invited such of the company, as liked it, to accompany\r\nthem thither. It was agreed that a nephew of Lord Graham’s, another\r\nof Lord Clifford’s, two gentlemen, friends of Sir Philip Harclay, and\r\nfather Oswald, should be of the party; together with several of Sir\r\nPhilip’s dependants and domestics, and the attendants on the rest. Lord\r\nFitz Owen gave orders for their speedy departure. Lord Graham and his\r\nfriends took leave of them, in order to return to his own home; but,\r\nbefore he went, he engaged his eldest nephew and heir to the second\r\ndaughter of the Lord Clifford; Sir Robert offered himself to the\r\neldest, who modestly received his address, and made no objection to his\r\nproposal. The fathers confirmed their engagement.\r\n\r\nLord Fitz-Owen promised to return to the celebration of the marriage;\r\nin the mean time he ordered his son to go and take possession of his\r\nuncle’s house, and to settle his household; He invited young Clifford,\r\nand some other gentlemen, to go with him. The company separated with\r\nregret, and with many promises of friendship on all sides; and the\r\ngentlemen of the North were to cultivate the good neighbourhood on both\r\nsides of the borders.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay and the Baron Fitz-Owen, with their friends and\r\nattendants, set forwards for the Castle of Lovel; a servant went before,\r\nat full speed, to acquaint the family of their approach. Edmund was in\r\ngreat anxiety of mind, now the crisis of his fate was near at hand; He\r\nenquired of the messenger, who were of the party? and finding that Sir\r\nPhilip Harclay was there, and that Sir Robert Fitz-Owen stayed in\r\nthe North, his hopes rose above his fears. Mr. William, attended by\r\na servant, rode forward to meet them; he desired Edmund to stay and\r\nreceive them. Edmund was under some difficulty with regard to his\r\nbehaviour to the lovely Emma; a thousand times his heart rose to his\r\nlips, as often he suppressed his emotions; they both sighed frequently,\r\nsaid little, thought much, and wished for the event. Master Walter was\r\ntoo young to partake of their anxieties, but he wished for the arrival\r\nof his father to end them.\r\n\r\nMr. William’s impatience spurred him on to meet his father; as soon as\r\nhe saw him, he rode up directly to him.\r\n\r\n“My dear father, you are welcome home!” said he.\r\n\r\n“I think not, sir,” said the Baron, and looked serious.\r\n\r\n“Why so, my lord?” said William.\r\n\r\n“Because it is no longer mine, but another man’s home,” answered he,\r\n“and I must receive my welcome from him.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning Edmund?” said William.\r\n\r\n“Whom else can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my Lord! he is your creature, your servant; he puts his fate into\r\nyour hands, and will submit to your pleasure in all things!”\r\n\r\n“Why comes he not to meet us?” said the Baron.\r\n\r\n“His fears prevent him,” said William; “but speak the word, and I will\r\nfetch him.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Baron, “we will wait on him.”\r\n\r\nWilliam looked confused.\r\n\r\n“Is Edmund so unfortunate,” said he, “as to have incurred your\r\ndispleasure?”\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay advanced, and laid his hand on William’s saddle.\r\n\r\n“Generous impatience! noble youth!” said he; “look round you, and see if\r\nyou can discover in this company one enemy of your friend! Leave to your\r\nexcellent father the time and manner of explaining himself; he only can\r\ndo justice to his own sentiments.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron smiled on Sir Philip; William’s countenance cleared up; they\r\nwent forward, and soon arrived at the Castle of Lovel.\r\n\r\nEdmund was walking to and fro in the hall, when he heard the horn that\r\nannounced their arrival; his emotions were so great that he could hardly\r\nsupport them. The Baron and Sir Philip entered the hall hand in hand;\r\nEdmund threw himself at their feet, and embraced their knees, but could\r\nnot utter a word. They raised him between them, and strove to encourage\r\nhim; but he threw himself into the arms of Sir Philip Harclay, deprived\r\nof strength, and almost of life. They supported him to a seat, where he\r\nrecovered by degrees, but had no power to speak his feelings; he looked\r\nup to his benefactors in the most affecting manner, he laid his hand\r\nupon his bosom, but was still silent.\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, my dear son,” said Sir Philip; “you are in the arms\r\nof your best friends. Look up to the happiness that awaits you--enjoy\r\nthe blessings that Heaven sends you--lift up your heart in gratitude to\r\nthe Creator, and think left of what you owe to the creature! You will\r\nhave time enough to pay us your acknowledgments hereafter.”\r\n\r\nThe company came round them, the servants flocked into the hall: shouts\r\nof joy were heard on all sides; the Baron came and took Edmund’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Rise, sir,” said he, “and do the honours of your house! it is yours\r\nfrom this day: we are your guests, and expect from you our welcome!”\r\n\r\nEdmund kneeled to the Baron, he spoke with a faltering voice:\r\n\r\n“My Lord, I am yours! all that I have is at your devotion! dispose of me\r\nas it pleases you best.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron embraced him with the greatest affection.\r\n\r\n“Look round you,” said he, “and salute your friends; these gentlemen\r\ncame hither to do you honour.”\r\n\r\nEdmund revived, he embraced and welcomed the gentlemen. Father\r\nOswald received his embrace with peculiar affection, and gave him his\r\nbenediction in a most affecting manner.\r\n\r\nEdmund exclaimed, “Pray for me, father! that I may bear all these\r\nblessings with gratitude and moderation!”\r\n\r\nHe then saluted and shook hands with all the servants, not omitting the\r\nmeanest; he distinguished Joseph by a cordial embrace; he called him his\r\ndear friend.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “I can return your friendship, and I am proud to\r\nacknowledge it!”\r\n\r\nThe old man, with a faltering voice, cried out:\r\n\r\n“Now I have lived long enough! I have seen my master’s son acknowledged\r\nfor the heir of Lovel!”\r\n\r\nThe hall echoed with his words, “Long live the heir of Lovel!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron took Edmund’s hands in his own:\r\n\r\n“Let us retire from this crowd,” said he; “we have business of a more\r\nprivate nature to transact.”\r\n\r\nHe led to the parlour, followed by Sir Philip and the other gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Where are my other children?” said he.\r\n\r\nWilliam retired, and presently returned with his brother and sister.\r\nThey kneeled to their father, who raised and embraced them. He then\r\ncalled out, “William!--Edmund!--come and receive my blessing also.”\r\n\r\nThey approached hand in hand, they kneeled, and he gave them a solemn\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\n“Your friendship deserves our praise, my children! love each other\r\nalways! and may Heaven pour down its choicest blessings upon your\r\nheads!”\r\n\r\nThey rose, and embraced in silent raptures of joy. Edmund presented his\r\nfriend to Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n“I understand you,” said he; “this gentleman was my first acquaintance\r\nof this family; he has a title to the second place in my heart; I shall\r\ntell him, at more leisure, how much I love and honour him for his own\r\nsake as well as yours.”\r\n\r\nHe embraced the youth, and desired his friendship.\r\n\r\n“Come hither, my Emma!” said the Baron.\r\n\r\nShe approached with tears on her check, sweetly blushing, like the\r\ndamask rose wet with the dew of the morning.\r\n\r\n“I must ask you a serious question, my child; answer me with the same\r\nsincerity you would to Heaven. You see this young man, the heir of\r\nLovel! You have known him long; consult your own heart, and tell me\r\nwhether you have any objection to receive him for your husband. I have\r\npromised to all this company to give you to him; but upon condition that\r\nyou approve him: I think him worthy of you; and, whether you accept him\r\nor not, he shall ever be to me a son; but Heaven forbid that I should\r\ncompel my child to give her hand, where she cannot bestow her heart!\r\nSpeak freely, and decide this point for me and for yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe fair Emma blushed, and was under some confusion; her virgin modesty\r\nprevented her speaking for some moments. Edmund trembled; he leaned upon\r\nWilliam’s shoulder to support himself. Emma cast her eye upon him, she\r\nsaw his emotion, and hastened to relieve him; and thus spoke in a soft\r\nvoice which gathered strength as she proceeded:\r\n\r\n“My lord and father’s goodness has always prevented my wishes; I am the\r\nhappiest of all children, in being able to obey his commands, without\r\noffering violence to my own inclinations. As I am called upon in this\r\npublic manner, it is but justice to this gentleman’s merit to declare,\r\nthat, were I at liberty to chuse a husband from all the world, he only\r\nshould be my choice, who I can say, with joy, is my father’s also.”\r\n\r\nEdmund bowed low, he advanced towards her; the Baron took his daughter’s\r\nhand, and presented it to him; he kneeled upon one knee, he took her\r\nhand, kissed it, and pressed it to his bosom. The Baron embraced and\r\nblessed them; he presented them to Sir Philip Harclay--“Receive and\r\nacknowledge your children!” said he.\r\n\r\n“I do receive them as the gift of Heaven!” said the noble knight; “they\r\nare as much mine as if I had begotten them: all that I have is theirs,\r\nand shall descend to their children for ever.” A fresh scene of\r\ncongratulation ensued; and the hearts of all the auditors were too much\r\nengaged to be able soon to return to the ease and tranquillity of common\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAfter they had refreshed themselves, and recovered from the emotions\r\nthey had sustained on this interesting occasion, Edmund thus addressed\r\nthe Baron:\r\n\r\n“On the brink of happiness I must claim your attention to a melancholy\r\nsubject. The bones of both my parents lie unburied in this house;\r\npermit me, my honoured lord, to perform my last duties to them, and the\r\nremainder of my life shall be devoted to you and yours.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said the Baron; “why have you not interred them?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I waited for your arrival, that you might be certified of the\r\nreality, and that no doubts might remain.”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubts,” said the Baron; “Alas! both the crime and punishment\r\nof the offender leave no room for them!” He sighed. “Let us now put an\r\nend to this affair; and, if possible, forget it for ever.”\r\n\r\n“If it will not be too painful to you, my lord, I would intreat you,\r\nwith these gentlemen our friends, to follow me into the east apartment,\r\nthe scene of my parents’ woes, and yet the dawning of my better hopes.”\r\n\r\nThey rose to attend him; he committed the Lady Emma to the care of her\r\nyoungest brother, observing that the scene was too solemn for a lady to\r\nbe present at it. They proceeded to the apartment; he showed the Baron\r\nthe fatal closet, and the place where the bones were found, also the\r\ntrunk that contained them; he recapitulated all that passed before their\r\narrival; he shewed them the coffin where the bones of the unfortunate\r\npair were deposited: he then desired the Baron to give orders for their\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied he, “it belongs to you to order, and every one here is\r\nready to perform it.”\r\n\r\nEdmund then desired father Oswald to give notice to the friars of the\r\nmonastery of St. Austin, that with their permission the funeral should\r\nbe solemnized there, and the bones interred in the church. He also gave\r\norders that the closet should be floored, the apartment repaired and put\r\nin order. He then returned to the other side of the Castle.\r\n\r\nPreparations being made for the funeral, it was performed a few days\r\nafter. Edmund attended in person as chief mourner, Sir Philip Harclay as\r\nthe second; Joseph desired he might assist as servant to the deceased.\r\nThey were followed by most people of the village. The story was now\r\nbecome public, and every one blessed Edmund for the piety and devotion\r\nwith which he performed the last duties to his parents.--Edmund appeared\r\nin deep mourning; the week after, he assisted at a mass for the repose\r\nof the deceased.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay ordered a monument to be erected to the memory of his\r\nfriends, with the following inscription:\r\n\r\n“Praye for the soules of Arthur Lord Lovele and Marie his wife, who were\r\ncut off in the flowere of theire youthe, by the trecherye and crueltie\r\nof theire neare kinnesmanne. Edmunde theire onlie sonne, one and twentie\r\nyeares after theire deathe, by the direction of heavene, made the\r\ndiscoverye of the mannere of theire deathe, and at the same time proved\r\nhis owne birthe. He collected theire bones together, and interred them\r\nin this place: A warning and proofe to late posteritie, of the justice\r\nof Providence, and the certaintie of Retribution.”\r\n\r\nThe Sunday after the funeral Edmund threw off his mourning, and appeared\r\nin a dress suitable to his condition. He received the compliments of his\r\nfriends with ease and cheerfulness, and began to enjoy his happiness. He\r\nasked an audience of his fair mistress, and was permitted to declare\r\nthe passion he had so long stifled in his own bosom. She gave him a\r\nfavourable hearing, and in a short time confessed that she had suffered\r\nequally in that suspense that was so grievous to him. They engaged\r\nthemselves by mutual vows to each other, and only waited the Baron’s\r\npleasure to complete their happiness; every cloud was vanished from\r\ntheir brows, and sweet tranquillity took possession of their bosoms.\r\nTheir friends shared their happiness; William and Edmund renewed their\r\nvows of everlasting friendship, and promised to be as much together as\r\nWilliam’s other duties would permit.\r\n\r\nThe Baron once more summoned all his company together; he told Edmund\r\nall that had passed relating to his brother in-law, his exile, and the\r\npilgrimage of Zadisky; he then related the circumstances of Sir Robert’s\r\nengagement to Lord Clifford’s daughter, his establishment in his uncle’s\r\nseat, and his own obligations to return time enough to be present at the\r\nmarriage: “But before I go,” said he, “I will give my daughter to the\r\nheir of Lovel, and then I shall have discharged my duty to him, and my\r\npromise to Sir Philip Harclay.”\r\n\r\n“You have nobly performed both,” said Sir Philip, “and whenever you\r\ndepart I shall be your companion.”\r\n\r\n“What,” said Edmund, “am I to be deprived of both my fathers at once?\r\nMy honoured lord, you have given away two houses--where do you intend to\r\nreside?”\r\n\r\n“No matter,” said the Baron; “I know I shall be welcome to both.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lord,” said Edmund, “stay here and be still the master; I shall\r\nbe proud to be under your command, and to be your servant as well as\r\nyour son!”\r\n\r\n“No, Edmund,” said the Baron, “that would not now be proper; this is\r\nyour castle, you are its lord and master, and it is incumbent on you to\r\nshew yourself worthy of the great things Providence has done for you.”\r\n\r\n“How shall I, a young man, acquit myself of so many duties as will be\r\nupon me, without the advice and assistance of my two paternal friends?\r\nOh, Sir Philip! will you too leave me? once you gave me hopes--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped greatly affected.\r\n\r\nSir Philip said, “Tell me truly, Edmund, do you really desire that I\r\nshould live with you?”\r\n\r\n“As truly, sir, as I desire life and happiness!”\r\n\r\n“Then, my dear child, I will live and die with you!”\r\n\r\nThey embraced with tears of affection, and Edmund was all joy and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n“My good Lord,” said Sir Philip, “you have disposed of two houses, and\r\nhave none ready to receive you; will you accept of mine? It is much at\r\nyour service, and its being in the same county with your eldest son,\r\nwill be an inducement to you to reside there.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron caught Sir Philip’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Noble sir, I thank you, and I will embrace your kind offer; I will be\r\nyour tenant for the present; my castle in Wales shall be put in repair,\r\nin the meantime; if I do not reside there, it will be an establishment\r\nfor one of my younger sons.”\r\n\r\n“But what will you do with your old soldiers and dependants?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I will never cast them off. There is another house on my\r\nestate that has been shut up many years; I will have it repaired and\r\nfurnished properly for the reception of my old men: I will endow it with\r\na certain sum to be paid annually, and will appoint a steward to\r\nmanage their revenue; I will continue it during the lives of the first\r\ninhabitants, and after that I shall leave it to my son here, to do as he\r\npleases.”\r\n\r\n“Your son,” said Edmund, “will make it the business of his life to act\r\nworthy of such a father.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Sir Philip, “I am satisfied that you will. I purpose to\r\nreside myself in that very apartment which my dear friend your father\r\ninhabited; I will tread in his footsteps, and think he sees me acting\r\nhis part in his son’s family. I will be attended by my own servants;\r\nand, whenever you desire it, I will give you my company; your joys, your\r\ngriefs shall be mine; I shall hold your children in my arms, and their\r\nprattle shall amuse my old age; and, as my last earthly wish, your hands\r\nshall close my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Long, very long,” said Edmund, with eyes and hands lifted up, “may it\r\nbe ere I perform so sad a duty!”\r\n\r\n“Long and happily may you live together!” said the Baron; “I will hope\r\nto see you sometimes, and to claim a share in your blessings. But let\r\nus give no more tears to sorrow, the rest shall be those of joy and\r\ntransport. The first step we take shall be to marry our Edmund; I will\r\ngive orders for the celebration, and they shall be the last orders I\r\nshall give in this house.” They then separated, and went to prepare for\r\nthe approaching solemnity.\r\n\r\nSir Philip and the Baron had a private conference concerning Edmund’s\r\nassuming the name and title of Lovel. “I am resolved,” said Sir Philip,\r\n“to go to the king; to acquaint him briefly with Edmund’s history; I\r\nwill request that he may be called up to parliament by a writ, for there\r\nis no need of a new patent, he being the true inheritor; in the mean\r\ntime he shall assume the name, arms, and title, and I will answer any\r\none that shall dispute his right to them.[”] Sir Philip then declared\r\nhis resolution to set out with the Baron at his departure, and to settle\r\nall his other affairs before he returned to take up his residence at the\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\nA few days after, the marriage was celebrated, to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of all parties. The Baron ordered the doors to be thrown\r\nopen, and the house free for all comers; with every other token of joy\r\nand festivity. Edmund appeared full of joy without levity, of mirth\r\nwithout extravagance; he received the congratulations of his friends,\r\nwith ease, freedom, and vivacity. He sent for his foster father and\r\nmother, who began to think themselves neglected, as he had been so\r\ndeeply engaged in affairs of more consequence that he had not been\r\nparticularly attentive to them; he made them come into the great hall,\r\nand presented them to his lady.\r\n\r\n“These,” said he, “are the good people to whom I am, under God, indebted\r\nfor my present happiness; they were my first benefactors; I was obliged\r\nto them for food and sustenance in my childhood, and this good woman\r\nnourished my infancy at her own breast.” The lady received them\r\ngraciously, and saluted Margery. Andrew kneeled down, and, with great\r\nhumility, begged Edmund’s pardon for his treatment of him in his\r\nchildhood. “I heartily forgive you,” said he, “and I will excuse you to\r\nyourself; it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder that\r\nwas eating your children’s bread; you saved my life, and afterwards\r\nyou sustained it by your food and raiment: I ought to have maintained\r\nmyself, and to have contributed to your maintenance. But besides this,\r\nyour treatment of me was the first of my preferment; it recommended\r\nme to the notice of this noble family. Everything that happened to me\r\nsince, has been a step to my present state of honour and happiness.\r\nNever man had so many benefactors as myself; but both they, and myself,\r\nhave been only instruments in the hands of Providence, to bring about\r\nits own purposes; let us praise God for all! I shared your poverty, and\r\nyou will share my riches; I will give you the cottage where you dwell,\r\nand the ground about it; I will also pay you the annual sum of ten\r\npounds for the lives of you both; I will put out your children to manual\r\ntrades, and assist you to provide for them in their own station; and you\r\nare to look upon this as paying a debt, and not bestowing a gift; I owe\r\nyou more than I can ever pay; and, if there be any thing further in my\r\npower that will contribute to your happiness, you can ask nothing in\r\nreason that I will deny you.”\r\n\r\nAndrew hid his face; “I cannot bear it!” said he; “oh what a brute was\r\nI, to abuse such a child as this! I shall never forgive myself!”\r\n\r\n“You must indeed, my friend; for I forgive and thank you.”\r\n\r\nAndrew retired back, but Margery came forward; she looked earnestly on\r\nEdmund, she then threw her arms about his neck, and wept aloud.\r\n\r\n“My precious child! my lovely babe! thank God, I have lived to see this\r\nday! I will rejoice in your good fortune, and your bounty to us, but\r\nI must ask one more favour yet; that I may sometimes come hither and\r\nbehold that gracious countenance, and thank God that I was honoured so\r\nfar as to give thee food from my own breast, and to bring thee up to be\r\na blessing to me, and to all that know thee!”\r\n\r\nEdmund was affected, he returned her embrace; he bade her come to the\r\nCastle as often as she pleased, and she should always be received as his\r\nmother; the bride saluted her, and told her the oftener she came, the\r\nmore welcome she should be.\r\n\r\nMargery and her husband retired, full of blessings and prayers for their\r\nhappiness; she gave vent to her joy, by relating to the servants and\r\nneighbours every circumstance of Edmund’s birth, infancy, and childhood.\r\nMany a tear was dropped by the auditors, and many a prayer wafted to\r\nHeaven for his happiness. Joseph took up the story where she left it:\r\nhe told the rising dawn of youth and virtue, darting its ray through the\r\nclouds of obscurity, and how every stroke of envy and malignity brushed\r\naway some part of the darkness that veiled its lustre. He told the story\r\nof the haunted apartment, and all the consequences of it; how he and\r\nOswald conveyed the youth away from the Castle, no more to return till\r\nhe came as master of it. He closed the tale with praise to Heaven for\r\nthe happy discovery, that gave such an heir to the house of Lovel;\r\nto his dependants such a Lord and Master; to mankind a friend and\r\nbenefactor. There was truly a house of joy; not that false kind, in\r\nthe midst of which there is heaviness, but that of rational creatures,\r\ngrateful to the Supreme Benefactor, raising their minds by a due\r\nenjoyment of earthly blessings to a preparation for a more perfect state\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nA few days after the wedding, the Lord Fitz-Owen began to prepare\r\nfor his journey to the north. He gave to Edmund the plate, linen, and\r\nfurniture of the Castle, the farming stock and utensils; he would have\r\nadded a sum of money, but Sir Philip stopped his hand.\r\n\r\n“We do not forget,” said he, “that you have other children, we will not\r\nsuffer you to injure them; give us your blessing and paternal affection,\r\nand we have nothing more to ask. I told you, my Lord, that you and I\r\nshould one day be sincere friends.”\r\n\r\n“We must be so,” answered the Baron; “it is impossible to be long your\r\nenemy. We are brothers, and shall be to our lives’ end.”\r\n\r\nThey regulated the young man’s household; the Baron gave leave to the\r\nservants to choose their master; the elder ones followed him (except\r\nJoseph, who desired to live with Edmund, as the chief happiness of his\r\nlife); most of the younger ones chose the service of the youthful pair.\r\nThere was a tender and affectionate parting on all sides. Edmund\r\nbesought his beloved William not to leave him. The Baron said, he must\r\ninsist on his being at his brother’s wedding, as a due attention to him,\r\nbut after that he should return to the Castle for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Baron and Sir Philip Harclay, with their train, set forward. Sir\r\nPhilip went to London and obtained all he desired for his Edmund; from\r\nthence he went into Yorkshire, and settled his affairs there, removing\r\nhis pensioners to his other house, and putting Lord Fitz-Owen in\r\npossession of his own. They had a generous contention about the terms;\r\nbut Sir Philip insisted on the Baron’s accepting the use of everything\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“You hold it in trust for a future grandchild,” said he, “whom I hope to\r\nlive to endow with it.”\r\n\r\nDuring Sir Philip’s absence, the young Lord Lovel caused the haunted\r\napartment to be repaired and furnished for the reception of his father\r\nby adoption. He placed his friend Joseph over all his men-servants,\r\nand ordered him to forbear his attendance; but the old man would always\r\nstand at the side-board, and feast his eyes with the countenance of\r\nhis own master’s son, surrounded with honour and happiness. John Wyatt\r\nwaited upon the person of his lord, and enjoyed his favour without\r\nabatement. Mr. William Fitz-Owen accompanied Sir Philip Harclay from the\r\nnorth country, when he returned to take up his residence at the Castle\r\nof Lovel.\r\n\r\nEdmund, in the arms of love and friendship, enjoyed with true relish\r\nthe blessings that surrounded him, with an heart overflowing with\r\nbenevolence to his fellow creatures, and raptures of gratitude to his\r\nCreator. His lady and himself were examples of conjugal affection and\r\nhappiness. Within a year from his marriage she brought him a son\r\nand heir, whose birth renewed the joy and congratulations of all his\r\nfriends. The Baron Fitz-Owen came to the baptism, and partook of his\r\nchildren’s blessings. The child was called Arthur, after the name of his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nThe year following was born a second son, who was called Philip Harclay;\r\nupon him the noble knight of that name settled his estate in Yorkshire;\r\nand by the king’s permission, he took the name and arms of that family.\r\n\r\nThe third son was called William; he inherited the fortune of his uncle\r\nof that name, who adopted him, and he made the Castle of Lovel his\r\nresidence, and died a bachelor.\r\n\r\nThe fourth son was called Edmund; the fifth Owen; and there was also a\r\ndaughter, called Emma.\r\n\r\nWhen time had worn out the prejudices of Sir Robert Fitz-Owen, the good\r\nold Baron of that name proposed a marriage between his eldest son\r\nand heir, and the daughter of Edmund Lord Lovel, which was happily\r\nconcluded. The nuptials were honoured with the presence of both\r\nfamilies; and the old Baron was so elevated with this happy union of\r\nhis descendants, that he cried out, “Now I am ready to die--I have lived\r\nlong enough--this is the band of love that unites all my children to me,\r\nand to each other!” He did not long survive this happy event; he died\r\nfull of years and honours, and his name was never mentioned but with\r\nthe deepest marks of gratitude, love and veneration. Sweet is the\r\nremembrance of the virtuous, and happy are the descendants of such\r\na father! they will think on him and emulate his virtues--they will\r\nremember him, and be ashamed to degenerate from their ancestor.\r\n\r\nMany years after Sir Philip Harclay settled at the Castle, he received\r\ntidings from his friend Zadisky, by one of the two servants who\r\nattended him to the Holy Land. From him he learned that his friend had\r\ndiscovered, by private advices, that he had a son living in Palestine,\r\nwhich was the chief motive of his leaving England; that he had met\r\nwith various adventures in pursuit of him; that at length he found\r\nhim, converted him to the Christian religion, and then persuaded him\r\nto retire from the world into a monastery by the side of Mount Libanus,\r\nwhere he intended to end his days.\r\n\r\nThat Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, had entered into the service\r\nof the Greek emperor, John Paleologus, not bearing to undergo a life of\r\nsolitude and retirement; that he made up a story of his being compelled\r\nto leave his native country by his relations, for having accidentally\r\nkilled one of them, and that he was treated with great cruelty and\r\ninjustice; that he had accepted a post in the emperor’s army, and was\r\nsoon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it.\r\n\r\nZadisky foresaw, and lamented the downfall of that Empire, and withdrew\r\nfrom the storm he saw approaching. Finally, he bade the messenger tell\r\nSir Philip Harclay and his adopted son, that he should not cease to pray\r\nfor them, and desired their prayers in return.\r\n\r\nSir Philip desired Lord Lovel to entertain this messenger in his\r\nservice. That good knight lived to extreme old age in honour and\r\nhappiness, and died in the arms of his beloved Edmund, who also\r\nperformed the last duties to his faithful Joseph.\r\n\r\nFather Oswald lived many years in the family as chaplain; he retired\r\nfrom thence at length, and died in his own monastery.\r\n\r\nEdmund Lord Lovel lived to old age, in peace, honour and happiness; and\r\ndied in the arms of his children.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Harclay caused the papers relating to his son’s history to be\r\ncollected together; the first part of it was written under his own eye\r\nin Yorkshire, the subsequent parts by Father Oswald at the Castle of\r\nLovel. All these, when together, furnish a striking lesson to posterity,\r\nof the over-ruling hand of Providence, and the certainty of RETRIBUTION.",
