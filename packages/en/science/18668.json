CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\n_All rights reserved._\r\nPublished June, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           TO\r\n        MY FRIEND\r\n    E. LE GRAND BEERS\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR LE GRAND,--You and I were early drawn together by a\r\n    common love of nature. Your researches into the natural\r\n    history of the tree-toad, your observations upon the\r\n    mud-turtles of Providence Township, your experiments with the\r\n    fresh-water lobster, all stimulated my enthusiasm in a\r\n    scientific direction, which has crystallized in this helpful\r\n    little book, dedicated to you.\r\n\r\n    Pray accept it as an insignificant payment on account for all\r\n    I owe to you.\r\n\r\n              THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears to the writer that there is urgent need of more \"nature\r\nbooks\"--books that are scraped clear of fiction and which display only\r\nthe carefully articulated skeleton of fact. Hence this little volume,\r\npresented with some hesitation and more modesty. Various chapters\r\nhave, at intervals, appeared in the pages of various publications. The\r\ncontinued narrative is now published for the first time; and the\r\nwriter trusts that it may inspire enthusiasm for natural and\r\nscientific research, and inculcate a passion for accurate observation\r\namong the young.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  _April 1, 1904._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Where the slanting forest eaves,\r\n    Shingled tight with greenest leaves,\r\n    Sweep the scented meadow-sedge,\r\n    Let us snoop along the edge;\r\n    Let us pry in hidden nooks,\r\n    Laden with our nature books,\r\n    Scaring birds with happy cries,\r\n    Chloroforming butterflies,\r\n    Rooting up each woodland plant,\r\n    Pinning beetle, fly, and ant,\r\n    So we may identify\r\n    What we've ruined, by-and-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SEARCH OF THE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause it all seems so improbable--so horribly impossible to me now,\r\nsitting here safe and sane in my own library--I hesitate to record an\r\nepisode which already appears to me less horrible than grotesque. Yet,\r\nunless this story is written now, I know I shall never have the\r\ncourage to tell the truth about the matter--not from fear of ridicule,\r\nbut because I myself shall soon cease to credit what I now know to be\r\ntrue. Yet scarcely a month has elapsed since I heard the stealthy\r\npurring of what I believed to be the shoaling undertow--scarcely a\r\nmonth ago, with my own eyes, I saw that which, even now, I am\r\nbeginning to believe never existed. As for the harbor-master--and the\r\nblow I am now striking at the old order of things--But of that I shall\r\nnot speak now, or later; I shall try to tell the story simply and\r\ntruthfully, and let my friends testify as to my probity and the\r\npublishers of this book corroborate them.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of February I resigned my position under the government\r\nand left Washington to accept an offer from Professor Farrago--whose\r\nname he kindly permits me to use--and on the first day of April I\r\nentered upon my new and congenial duties as general superintendent of\r\nthe water-fowl department connected with the Zoological Gardens then\r\nin course of erection at Bronx Park, New York.\r\n\r\nFor a week I followed the routine, examining the new foundations,\r\nstudying the architect's plans, following the surveyors through the\r\nBronx thickets, suggesting arrangements for water-courses and pools\r\ndestined to be included in the enclosures for swans, geese, pelicans,\r\nherons, and such of the waders and swimmers as we might expect to\r\nacclimate in Bronx Park.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time the policy of the trustees and officers of the\r\nZoological Gardens neither to employ collectors nor to send out\r\nexpeditions in search of specimens. The society decided to depend upon\r\nvoluntary contributions, and I was always busy, part of the day, in\r\ndictating answers to correspondents who wrote offering their services\r\nas hunters of big game, collectors of all sorts of fauna, trappers,\r\nsnarers, and also to those who offered specimens for sale, usually at\r\nexorbitant rates.\r\n\r\nTo the proprietors of five-legged kittens, mangy lynxes, moth-eaten\r\ncoyotes, and dancing bears I returned courteous but uncompromising\r\nrefusals--of course, first submitting all such letters, together with\r\nmy replies, to Professor Farrago.\r\n\r\nOne day towards the end of May, however, just as I was leaving Bronx\r\nPark to return to town, Professor Lesard, of the reptilian department,\r\ncalled out to me that Professor Farrago wanted to see me a moment; so\r\nI put my pipe into my pocket again and retraced my steps to the\r\ntemporary, wooden building occupied by Professor Farrago, general\r\nsuperintendent of the Zoological Gardens. The professor, who was\r\nsitting at his desk before a pile of letters and replies submitted for\r\napproval by me, pushed his glasses down and looked over them at me\r\nwith a whimsical smile that suggested amusement, impatience,\r\nannoyance, and perhaps a faint trace of apology.\r\n\r\n\"Now, here's a letter,\" he said, with a deliberate gesture towards a\r\nsheet of paper impaled on a file--\"a letter that I suppose you\r\nremember.\" He disengaged the sheet of paper and handed it to me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" I replied, with a shrug; \"of course the man is\r\nmistaken--or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or what?\" demanded Professor Farrago, tranquilly, wiping his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"--Or a liar,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence he leaned back in his chair and bade me read the\r\nletter to him again, and I did so with a contemptuous tolerance for\r\nthe writer, who must have been either a very innocent victim or a very\r\nstupid swindler. I said as much to Professor Farrago, but, to my\r\nsurprise, he appeared to waver.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" he said, with his near-sighted, embarrassed smile, \"that\r\nnine hundred and ninety-nine men in a thousand would throw that letter\r\naside and condemn the writer as a liar or a fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion,\" said I, \"he's one or the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"He isn't--in mine,\" said the professor, placidly.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Here is a man living all alone on a strip of\r\nrock and sand between the wilderness and the sea, who wants you to\r\nsend somebody to take charge of a bird that doesn't exist!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know,\" asked Professor Farrago, \"that the bird in question\r\ndoes not exist?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is generally accepted,\" I replied, sarcastically, \"that the great\r\nauk has been extinct for years. Therefore I may be pardoned for\r\ndoubting that our correspondent possesses a pair of them alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you young fellows,\" said the professor, smiling wearily, \"you\r\nembark on a theory for destinations that don't exist.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair, his amused eyes searching space for the\r\nimagery that made him smile.\r\n\r\n\"Like swimming squirrels, you navigate with the help of Heaven and a\r\nstiff breeze, but you never land where you hope to--do you?\"\r\n\r\nRather red in the face, I said: \"Don't you believe the great auk to be\r\nextinct?\"\r\n\r\n\"Audubon saw the great auk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has seen a single specimen since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody--except our correspondent here,\" he replied, laughing.\r\n\r\nI laughed, too, considering the interview at an end, but the professor\r\nwent on, coolly:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is that our correspondent has--and I am daring to believe\r\nthat it _is_ the great auk itself--I want you to secure it for the\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my astonishment subsided my first conscious sentiment was one of\r\npity. Clearly, Professor Farrago was on the verge of dotage--ah, what\r\na loss to the world!\r\n\r\nI believe now that Professor Farrago perfectly interpreted my\r\nthoughts, but he betrayed neither resentment nor impatience. I drew a\r\nchair up beside his desk--there was nothing to do but to obey, and\r\nthis fool's errand was none of my conceiving.\r\n\r\nTogether we made out a list of articles necessary for me and itemized\r\nthe expenses I might incur, and I set a date for my return, allowing\r\nno margin for a successful termination to the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" said the professor. \"What I want you to do is to\r\nget those birds here safely. Now, how many men will you take?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" I replied, bluntly; \"it's a useless expense, unless there is\r\nsomething to bring back. If there is I'll wire you, you may be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Professor Farrago, good-humoredly, \"you shall have\r\nall the assistance you may require. Can you leave to-night?\"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was certainly prompt. I nodded, half-sulkily, aware\r\nof his amusement.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I said, picking up my hat, \"I am to start north to find a place\r\ncalled Black Harbor, where there is a man named Halyard who possesses,\r\namong other household utensils, two extinct great auks--\"\r\n\r\nWe were both laughing by this time. I asked him why on earth he\r\ncredited the assertion of a man he had never before heard of.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" he replied, with the same half-apologetic, half-humorous\r\nsmile, \"it is instinct. I feel, somehow, that this man Halyard _has_\r\ngot an auk--perhaps two. I can't get away from the idea that we are on\r\nthe eve of acquiring the rarest of living creatures. It's odd for a\r\nscientist to talk as I do; doubtless you're shocked--admit it, now!\"\r\n\r\nBut I was not shocked; on the contrary, I was conscious that the same\r\nstrange hope that Professor Farrago cherished was beginning, in spite\r\nof me, to stir my pulses, too.\r\n\r\n\"If he has--\" I began, then stopped.\r\n\r\nThe professor and I looked hard at each other in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" he said, encouragingly.\r\n\r\nBut I had nothing more to say, for the prospect of beholding with my\r\nown eyes a living specimen of the great auk produced a series of\r\nconflicting emotions within me which rendered speech profanely\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nAs I took my leave Professor Farrago came to the door of the\r\ntemporary, wooden office and handed me the letter written by the man\r\nHalyard. I folded it and put it into my pocket, as Halyard might\r\nrequire it for my own identification.\r\n\r\n\"How much does he want for the pair?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand dollars. Don't demur--if the birds are really--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said, hastily, not daring to hope too much.\r\n\r\n\"One thing more,\" said Professor Farrago, gravely; \"you know, in that\r\nlast paragraph of his letter, Halyard speaks of something else in the\r\nway of specimens--an undiscovered species of amphibious biped--just\r\nread that paragraph again, will you?\"\r\n\r\nI drew the letter from my pocket and read as he directed:\r\n\r\n    \"When you have seen the two living specimens of the great auk,\r\n    and have satisfied yourself that I tell the truth, you may be\r\n    wise enough to listen without prejudice to a statement I shall\r\n    make concerning the existence of the strangest creature ever\r\n    fashioned. I will merely say, at this time, that the creature\r\n    referred to is an amphibious biped and inhabits the ocean near\r\n    this coast. More I cannot say, for I personally have not seen\r\n    the animal, but I have a witness who has, and there are many\r\n    who affirm that they have seen the creature. You will\r\n    naturally say that my statement amounts to nothing; but when\r\n    your representative arrives, if he be free from prejudice, I\r\n    expect his reports to you concerning this sea-biped will\r\n    confirm the solemn statements of a witness I _know_ to be\r\n    unimpeachable.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,      BURTON HALYARD.\r\n\r\n  \"BLACK HARBOR.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, after a moment's thought, \"here goes for the\r\nwild-goose chase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wild auk, you mean,\" said Professor Farrago, shaking hands with me.\r\n\"You will start to-night, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but Heaven knows how I'm ever going to land in this man\r\nHalyard's door-yard. Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\"About that sea-biped--\" began Professor Farrago, shyly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't!\" I said; \"I can swallow the auks, feathers and claws, but\r\nif this fellow Halyard is hinting he's seen an amphibious creature\r\nresembling a man--\"\r\n\r\n\"--Or a woman,\" said the professor, cautiously.\r\n\r\nI retired, disgusted, my faith shaken in the mental vigor of Professor\r\nFarrago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three days' voyage by boat and rail was irksome. I bought my kit\r\nat Sainte Croix, on the Central Pacific Railroad, and on June 1st I\r\nbegan the last stage of my journey _via_ the Sainte Isole broad-gauge,\r\narriving in the wilderness by daylight. A tedious forced march by\r\nblazed trail, freshly spotted on the wrong side, of course, brought me\r\nto the northern terminus of the rusty, narrow-gauge lumber railway\r\nwhich runs from the heart of the hushed pine wilderness to the sea.\r\n\r\nAlready a long train of battered flat-cars, piled with sluice-props\r\nand roughly hewn sleepers, was moving slowly off into the brooding\r\nforest gloom, when I came in sight of the track; but I developed a\r\ngratifying and unexpected burst of speed, shouting all the while. The\r\ntrain stopped; I swung myself aboard the last car, where a pleasant\r\nyoung fellow was sitting on the rear brake, chewing spruce and reading\r\na letter.\r\n\r\n\"Come aboard, sir,\" he said, looking up with a smile; \"I guess you're\r\nthe man in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking for a man named Halyard,\" I said, dropping rifle and\r\nknapsack on the fresh-cut, fragrant pile of pine. \"Are you Halyard?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm Francis Lee, bossing the mica pit at Port-of-Waves,\" he\r\nreplied, \"but this letter is from Halyard, asking me to look out for a\r\nman in a hurry from Bronx Park, New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm that man,\" said I, filling my pipe and offering him a share of\r\nthe weed of peace, and we sat side by side smoking very amiably, until\r\na signal from the locomotive sent him forward and I was left alone,\r\nlounging at ease, head pillowed on both arms, watching the blue sky\r\nflying through the branches overhead.\r\n\r\nLong before we came in sight of the ocean I smelled it; the fresh,\r\nsalt aroma stole into my senses, drowsy with the heated odor of pine\r\nand hemlock, and I sat up, peering ahead into the dusky sea of pines.\r\n\r\nFresher and fresher came the wind from the sea, in puffs, in mild,\r\nsweet breezes, in steady, freshening currents, blowing the feathery\r\ncrowns of the pines, setting the balsam's blue tufts rocking.\r\n\r\nLee wandered back over the long line of flats, balancing himself\r\nnonchalantly as the cars swung around a sharp curve, where water\r\ndripped from a newly propped sluice that suddenly emerged from the\r\ndepths of the forest to run parallel to the railroad track.\r\n\r\n\"Built it this spring,\" he said, surveying his handiwork, which seemed\r\nto undulate as the cars swept past. \"It runs to the cove--or ought\r\nto--\" He stopped abruptly with a thoughtful glance at me.\r\n\r\n\"So you're going over to Halyard's?\" he continued, as though answering\r\na question asked by himself.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"You've never been there--of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"and I'm not likely to go again.\"\r\n\r\nI would have told him why I was going if I had not already begun to\r\nfeel ashamed of my idiotic errand.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you're going to look at those birds of his,\" continued Lee,\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I am,\" I said, sulkily, glancing askance to see whether he\r\nwas smiling.\r\n\r\nBut he only asked me, quite seriously, whether a great auk was really\r\na very rare bird; and I told him that the last one ever seen had been\r\nfound dead off Labrador in January, 1870. Then I asked him whether\r\nthese birds of Halyard's were really great auks, and he replied,\r\nsomewhat indifferently, that he supposed they were--at least, nobody\r\nhad ever before seen such birds near Port-of-Waves.\r\n\r\n\"There's something else,\" he said, running, a pine-sliver through his\r\npipe-stem--\"something that interests us all here more than auks, big\r\nor little. I suppose I might as well speak of it, as you are bound to\r\nhear about it sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and I could see that he was embarrassed, searching for\r\nthe exact words to convey his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said I, \"you have anything in this region more important to\r\nscience than the great auk, I should be very glad to know about it.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was the faintest tinge of sarcasm in my voice, for he\r\nshot a sharp glance at me and then turned slightly. After a moment,\r\nhowever, he put his pipe into his pocket, laid hold of the brake with\r\nboth hands, vaulted to his perch aloft, and glanced down at me.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the harbor-master?\" he asked, maliciously.\r\n\r\n\"Which harbor-master?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know before long,\" he observed, with a satisfied glance into\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\nThis rather extraordinary observation puzzled me. I waited for him to\r\nresume, and, as he did not, I asked him what he meant.\r\n\r\n\"If I knew,\" he said, \"I'd tell you. But, come to think of it, I'd be\r\na fool to go into details with a scientific man. You'll hear about the\r\nharbor-master--perhaps you will see the harbor-master. In that event I\r\nshould be glad to converse with you on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at his prim and precise manner, and, after a\r\nmoment, he also laughed, saying:\r\n\r\n\"It hurts a man's vanity to know he knows a thing that somebody else\r\nknows he doesn't know. I'm damned if I say another word about the\r\nharbor-master until you've been to Halyard's!\"\r\n\r\n\"A harbor-master,\" I persisted, \"is an official who superintends the\r\nmooring of ships--isn't he?\"\r\n\r\nBut he refused to be tempted into conversation, and we lounged\r\nsilently on the lumber until a long, thin whistle from the locomotive\r\nand a rush of stinging salt-wind brought us to our feet. Through the\r\ntrees I could see the bluish-black ocean, stretching out beyond black\r\nheadlands to meet the clouds; a great wind was roaring among the trees\r\nas the train slowly came to a stand-still on the edge of the primeval\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nLee jumped to the ground and aided me with my rifle and pack, and then\r\nthe train began to back away along a curved side-track which, Lee\r\nsaid, led to the mica-pit and company stores.\r\n\r\n\"Now what will you do?\" he asked, pleasantly. \"I can give you a good\r\ndinner and a decent bed to-night if you like--and I'm sure Mrs. Lee\r\nwould be very glad to have you stop with us as long as you choose.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him, but said that I was anxious to reach Halyard's before\r\ndark, and he very kindly led me along the cliffs and pointed out the\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\"This man Halyard,\" he said, \"is an invalid. He lives at a cove called\r\nBlack Harbor, and all his truck goes through to him over the company's\r\nroad. We receive it here, and send a pack-mule through once a month.\r\nI've met him; he's a bad-tempered hypochondriac, a cynic at heart, and\r\na man whose word is never doubted. If he says he has a great auk, you\r\nmay be satisfied he has.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating with excitement at the prospect; I looked out\r\nacross the wooded headlands and tangled stretches of dune and hollow,\r\ntrying to realize what it might mean to me, to Professor Farrago, to\r\nthe world, if I should lead back to New York a live auk.\r\n\r\n\"He's a crank,\" said Lee; \"frankly, I don't like him. If you find it\r\nunpleasant there, come back to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Halyard live alone?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--except for a professional trained nurse--poor thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"A man?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lee, disgustedly.\r\n\r\nPresently he gave me a peculiar glance; hesitated, and finally said:\r\n\"Ask Halyard to tell you about his nurse and--the harbor-master.\r\nGood-bye--I'm due at the quarry. Come and stay with us whenever you\r\ncare to; you will find a welcome at Port-of-Waves.\"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands and parted on the cliff, he turning back into the\r\nforest along the railway, I starting northward, pack slung, rifle over\r\nmy shoulder. Once I met a group of quarrymen, faces burned brick-red,\r\nscarred hands swinging as they walked. And, as I passed them with a\r\nnod, turning, I saw that they also had turned to look after me, and I\r\ncaught a word or two of their conversation, whirled back to me on the\r\nsea-wind.\r\n\r\nThey were speaking of the harbor-master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards sunset I came out on a sheer granite cliff where the sea-birds\r\nwere whirling and clamoring, and the great breakers dashed, rolling in\r\ndouble-thundered reverberations on the sun-dyed, crimson sands below\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nAcross the half-moon of beach towered another cliff, and, behind this,\r\nI saw a column of smoke rising in the still air. It certainly came\r\nfrom Halyard's chimney, although the opposite cliff prevented me from\r\nseeing the house itself.\r\n\r\nI rested a moment to refill my pipe, then resumed rifle and pack, and\r\ncautiously started to skirt the cliffs. I had descended half-way\r\ntowards the beech, and was examining the cliff opposite, when\r\nsomething on the very top of the rock arrested my attention--a man\r\ndarkly outlined against the sky. The next moment, however, I knew it\r\ncould not be a man, for the object suddenly glided over the face of\r\nthe cliff and slid down the sheer, smooth lace like a lizard. Before I\r\ncould get a square look at it, the thing crawled into the surf--or, at\r\nleast, it seemed to--but the whole episode occurred so suddenly, so\r\nunexpectedly, that I was not sure I had seen anything at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was curious enough to climb the cliff on the land side and\r\nmake my way towards the spot where I imagined I saw the man. Of\r\ncourse, there was nothing there--not a trace of a human being, I mean.\r\nSomething _had_ been there--a sea-otter, possibly--for the remains of\r\na freshly killed fish lay on the rock, eaten to the back-bone and\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, below me, I saw the house, a freshly painted, trim,\r\nflimsy structure, modern, and very much out of harmony with the\r\nsplendid savagery surrounding it. It struck a nasty, cheap note in the\r\nnoble, gray monotony of headland and sea.\r\n\r\nThe descent was easy enough. I crossed the crescent beach, hard as\r\npink marble, and found a little trodden path among the rocks, that led\r\nto the front porch of the house.\r\n\r\nThere were two people on the porch--I heard their voices before I saw\r\nthem--and when I set my foot upon the wooden steps, I saw one of them,\r\na woman, rise from her chair and step hastily towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Come back!\" cried the other, a man with a smooth-shaven, deeply lined\r\nface, and a pair of angry, blue eyes; and the woman stepped back\r\nquietly, acknowledging my lifted hat with a silent inclination.\r\n\r\nThe man, who was reclining in an invalid's rolling-chair, clapped both\r\nlarge, pale hands to the wheels and pushed himself out along the\r\nporch. He had shawls pinned about him, an untidy, drab-colored hat on\r\nhis head, and, when he looked down at me, he scowled.\r\n\r\n\"I know who you are,\" he said, in his acid voice; \"you're one of the\r\nZoological men from Bronx Park. You look like it, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to recognize you from your reputation,\" I replied,\r\nirritated at his discourtesy.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" he replied, with something between a sneer and a laugh, \"I'm\r\nobliged for your frankness. You're after my great auks, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else would have tempted me into this place,\" I replied,\r\nsincerely.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven for that,\" he said. \"Sit down a moment; you've\r\ninterrupted us.\" Then, turning to the young woman, who wore the neat\r\ngown and tiny cap of a professional nurse, he bade her resume what she\r\nhad been saying. She did so, with deprecating glance at me, which made\r\nthe old man sneer again.\r\n\r\n\"It happened so suddenly,\" she said, in her low voice, \"that I had no\r\nchance to get back. The boat was drifting in the cove; I sat in the\r\nstern, reading, both oars shipped, and the tiller swinging. Then I\r\nheard a scratching under the boat, but thought it might be\r\nsea-weed--and, next moment, came those soft thumpings, like the sound\r\nof a big fish rubbing its nose against a float.\"\r\n\r\nHalyard clutched the wheels of his chair and stared at the girl in\r\ngrim displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know enough to be frightened?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No--not then,\" she said, coloring faintly; \"but when, after a few\r\nmoments, I looked up and saw the harbor-master running up and down the\r\nbeach, I was horribly frightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" said Halyard, sarcastically; \"it was about time.\" Then,\r\nturning to me, he rasped out: \"And that young lady was obliged to row\r\nall the way to Port-of-Waves and call to Lee's quarrymen to take her\r\nboat in.\"\r\n\r\nCompletely mystified, I looked from Halyard to the girl, not in the\r\nleast comprehending what all this meant.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said Halyard, ungraciously, which curt phrase was\r\napparently the usual dismissal for the nurse.\r\n\r\nShe rose, and I rose, and she passed me with an inclination, stepping\r\nnoiselessly into the house.\r\n\r\n\"I want beef-tea!\" bawled Halyard after her; then he gave me an\r\nunamiable glance.\r\n\r\n\"I was a well-bred man,\" he sneered; \"I'm a Harvard graduate, too, but\r\nI live as I like, and I do what I like, and I say what I like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly are not reticent,\" I said, disgusted.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I be?\" he rasped; \"I pay that young woman for my\r\nirritability; it's a bargain between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"In your domestic affairs,\" I said, \"there is nothing that interests\r\nme. I came to see those auks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You probably believe them to be razor-billed auks,\" he said,\r\ncontemptuously. \"But they're not; they're great auks.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested that he permit me to examine them, and he replied,\r\nindifferently, that they were in a pen in his backyard, and that I was\r\nfree to step around the house when I cared to.\r\n\r\nI laid my rifle and pack on the veranda, and hastened off with mixed\r\nemotions, among which hope no longer predominated. No man in his\r\nsenses would keep two such precious prizes in a pen in his backyard, I\r\nargued, and I was perfectly prepared to find anything from a puffin to\r\na penguin in that pen.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget, as long as I live, my stupor of amazement when I\r\ncame to the wire-covered enclosure. Not only were there two great\r\nauks in the pen, alive, breathing, squatting in bulky majesty on their\r\nsea-weed bed, but one of them was gravely contemplating two newly\r\nhatched chicks, all bill and feet, which nestled sedately at the edge\r\nof a puddle of salt-water, where some small fish were swimming.\r\n\r\nFor a while excitement blinded, nay, deafened me. I tried to realize\r\nthat I was gazing upon the last individuals of an all but extinct\r\nrace--the sole survivors of the gigantic auk, which, for thirty years,\r\nhas been accounted an extinct creature.\r\n\r\nI believe that I did not move muscle nor limb until the sun had gone\r\ndown and the crowding darkness blurred my straining eyes and blotted\r\nthe great, silent, bright-eyed birds from sight.\r\n\r\nEven then I could not tear myself away from the enclosure; I listened\r\nto the strange, drowsy note of the male bird, the fainter responses of\r\nthe female, the thin plaints of the chicks, huddling under her breast;\r\nI heard their flipper-like, embryotic wings beating sleepily as the\r\nbirds stretched and yawned their beaks and clacked them, preparing for\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\"If you please,\" came a soft voice from the door, \"Mr. Halyard awaits\r\nyour company to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI dined well--or, rather, I might have enjoyed my dinner if Mr.\r\nHalyard had been eliminated; and the feast consisted exclusively of a\r\njoint of beef, the pretty nurse, and myself. She was exceedingly\r\nattractive--with a disturbing fashion of lowering her head and raising\r\nher dark eyes when spoken to.\r\n\r\nAs for Halyard, he was unspeakable, bundled up in his snuffy shawls,\r\nand making uncouth noises over his gruel. But it is only just to say\r\nthat his table was worth sitting down to and his wine was sound as a\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\"Yah!\" he snapped, \"I'm sick of this cursed soup--and I'll trouble you\r\nto fill my glass--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is dangerous for you to touch claret,\" said the pretty nurse.\r\n\r\n\"I might as well die at dinner as anywhere,\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said I, cheerfully passing the decanter, but he did not\r\nappear overpleased with the attention.\r\n\r\n\"I can't smoke, either,\" he snarled, hitching the shawls around until\r\nhe looked like Richard the Third.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was good enough to shove a box of cigars at me, and I took\r\none and stood up, as the pretty nurse slipped past and vanished into\r\nthe little parlor beyond.\r\n\r\nWe sat there for a while without speaking. He picked irritably at the\r\nbread-crumbs on the cloth, never glancing in my direction; and I,\r\ntired from my long foot-tour, lay back in my chair, silently\r\nappreciating one of the best cigars I ever smoked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he rasped out at length, \"what do you think of my auks--and my\r\nveracity?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that both were unimpeachable.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they call me a swindler down there at your museum?\" he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nI admitted that I had heard the term applied. Then I made a clean\r\nbreast of the matter, telling him that it was I who had doubted; that\r\nmy chief, Professor Farrago, had sent me against my will, and that I\r\nwas ready and glad to admit that he, Mr. Halyard, was a benefactor of\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\n\"Bosh!\" he said. \"What good does a confounded wobbly, bandy-toed bird\r\ndo to the human race?\"\r\n\r\nBut he was pleased, nevertheless; and presently he asked me, not\r\nunamiably, to punish his claret again.\r\n\r\n\"I'm done for,\" he said; \"good things to eat and drink are no good to\r\nme. Some day I'll get mad enough to have a fit, and then--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused to yawn.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he continued, \"that little nurse of mine will drink up my\r\nclaret and go back to civilization, where people are polite.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow or other, in spite of the fact that Halyard was an old pig,\r\nwhat he said touched me. There was certainly not much left in life for\r\nhim--as he regarded life.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to leave her this house,\" he said, arranging his shawls.\r\n\"She doesn't know it. I'm going to leave her my money, too. She\r\ndoesn't know that. Good Lord! What kind of a woman can she be to stand\r\nmy bad temper for a few dollars a month!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said I, \"that it's partly because she's poor, partly\r\nbecause she's sorry for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up with a ghastly smile.\r\n\r\n\"You think she really is sorry?\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer he went on: \"I'm no mawkish sentimentalist, and\r\nI won't allow anybody to be sorry for me--do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not sorry for you!\" I said, hastily, and, for the first time\r\nsince I had seen him, he laughed heartily, without a sneer.\r\n\r\nWe both seemed to feel better after that; I drank his wine and smoked\r\nhis cigars, and he appeared to take a certain grim pleasure in\r\nwatching me.\r\n\r\n\"There's no fool like a young fool,\" he observed, presently.\r\n\r\nAs I had no doubt he referred to me, I paid him no attention.\r\n\r\nAfter fidgeting with his shawls, he gave me an oblique scowl and asked\r\nme my age.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Sort of a tadpole, aren't you?\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs I took no offence, he repeated the remark.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come,\" said I, \"there's no use in trying to irritate me. I see\r\nthrough you; a row acts like a cocktail on you--but you'll have to\r\nstick to gruel in my company.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call that impudence!\" he rasped out, wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what you call it,\" I replied, undisturbed, \"I am not\r\ngoing to be worried by you. Anyway,\" I ended, \"it is my opinion that\r\nyou could be very good company if you chose.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition appeared to take his breath away--at least, he said\r\nnothing more; and I finished my cigar in peace and tossed the stump\r\ninto a saucer.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, \"what price do you set upon your birds, Mr. Halyard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand dollars,\" he snapped, with an evil smile.\r\n\r\n\"You will receive a certified check when the birds are delivered,\" I\r\nsaid, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you agree to that outrageous bargain--and I\r\nwon't take a cent less, either--Good Lord!--haven't you any spirit\r\nleft?\" he cried, half rising from his pile of shawls.\r\n\r\nHis piteous eagerness for a dispute sent me into laughter impossible\r\nto control, and he eyed me, mouth open, animosity rising visibly.\r\n\r\nThen he seized the wheels of his invalid chair and trundled away, too\r\nmad to speak; and I strolled out into the parlor, still laughing.\r\n\r\nThe pretty nurse was there, sewing under a hanging lamp.\r\n\r\n\"If I am not indiscreet--\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Indiscretion is the better part of valor,\" said she, dropping her\r\nhead but raising her eyes.\r\n\r\nSo I sat down with a frivolous smile peculiar to the appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"you are hemming a 'kerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless I am not,\" she said; \"this is a night-cap for Mr.\r\nHalyard.\"\r\n\r\nA mental vision of Halyard in a night-cap, very mad, nearly set me\r\nlaughing again.\r\n\r\n\"Like the King of Yvetot, he wears his crown in bed,\" I said,\r\nflippantly.\r\n\r\n\"The King of Yvetot might have made that remark,\" she observed,\r\nre-threading her needle.\r\n\r\nIt is unpleasant to be reproved. How large and red and hot a man's\r\nears feel.\r\n\r\nTo cool them, I strolled out to the porch; and, after a while, the\r\npretty nurse came out, too, and sat down in a chair not far away. She\r\nprobably regretted her lost opportunity to be flirted with.\r\n\r\n\"I have so little company--it is a great relief to see somebody from\r\nthe world,\" she said. \"If you can be agreeable, I wish you would.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that she had come out to see me was so agreeable that I\r\nremained speechless until she said: \"Do tell me what people are doing\r\nin New York.\"\r\n\r\nSo I seated myself on the steps and talked about the portion of the\r\nworld inhabited by me, while she sat sewing in the dull light that\r\nstraggled out from the parlor windows.\r\n\r\nShe had a certain coquetry of her own, using the usual methods with an\r\nindividuality that was certainly fetching. For instance, when she lost\r\nher needle--and, another time, when we both, on hands and knees,\r\nhunted for her thimble.\r\n\r\nHowever, directions for these pastimes may be found in contemporary\r\nclassics.\r\n\r\nI was as entertaining as I could be--perhaps not quite as entertaining\r\nas a young man usually thinks he is. However, we got on very well\r\ntogether until I asked her tenderly who the harbor-master might be,\r\nwhom they all discussed so mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\"I do not care to speak about it,\" she said, with a primness of which\r\nI had not suspected her capable.\r\n\r\nOf course I could scarcely pursue the subject after that--and, indeed,\r\nI did not intend to--so I began to tell her how I fancied I had seen a\r\nman on the cliff that afternoon, and how the creature slid over the\r\nsheer rock like a snake.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement, she asked me to kindly discontinue the account of my\r\nadventures, in an icy tone, which left no room for protest.\r\n\r\n\"It was only a sea-otter,\" I tried to explain, thinking perhaps she\r\ndid not care for snake stories.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation did not appear to interest her, and I was\r\nmortified to observe that my impression upon her was anything but\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't seem to like me and my stories,\" thought I, \"but she is\r\ntoo young, perhaps, to appreciate them.\"\r\n\r\nSo I forgave her--for she was even prettier than I had thought her at\r\nfirst--and I took my leave, saying that Mr. Halyard would doubtless\r\ndirect me to my room.\r\n\r\nHalyard was in his library, cleaning a revolver, when I entered.\r\n\r\n\"Your room is next to mine,\" he said; \"pleasant dreams, and kindly\r\nrefrain from snoring.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I venture an absurd hope that you will do the same!\" I replied,\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\nThat maddened him, so I hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\nI had been asleep for at least two hours when a movement by my bedside\r\nand a light in my eyes awakened me. I sat bolt upright in bed,\r\nblinking at Halyard, who, clad in a dressing-gown and wearing a\r\nnight-cap, had wheeled himself into my room with one hand, while with\r\nthe other he solemnly waved a candle over my head.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so cursed lonely,\" he said--\"come, there's a good fellow--talk to\r\nme in your own original, impudent way.\"\r\n\r\nI objected strenuously, but he looked so worn and thin, so lonely and\r\nbad-tempered, so lovelessly grotesque, that I got out of bed and\r\npassed a spongeful of cold water over my head.\r\n\r\nThen I returned to bed and propped the pillows up for a back-rest,\r\nready to quarrel with him if it might bring some little pleasure into\r\nhis morbid existence.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, amiably, \"I'm too worried to quarrel, but I'm much\r\nobliged for your kindly offer. I want to tell you something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I asked, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"I want to ask you if you ever saw a man with gills like a fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gills?\" I repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, gills! Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied, angrily, \"and neither did you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never did,\" he said, in a curiously placid voice, \"but there's\r\na man with gills like a fish who lives in the ocean out there. Oh, you\r\nneedn't look that way--nobody ever thinks of doubting my word, and I\r\ntell you that there's a man--or a thing that looks like a man--as big\r\nas you are, too--all slate-colored--with nasty red gills like a\r\nfish!--and I've a witness to prove what I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" I asked, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"The witness? My nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! She saw a slate-colored man with gills?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she did. So did Francis Lee, superintendent of the Mica Quarry\r\nCompany at Port-of-Waves. So have a dozen men who work in the quarry.\r\nOh, you needn't laugh, young man. It's an old story here, and anybody\r\ncan tell you about the harbor-master.\"\r\n\r\n\"The harbor-master!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that slate-colored thing with gills, that looks like a\r\nman--and--by Heaven! _is_ a man--that's the harbor-master. Ask any\r\nquarryman at Port-of-Waves what it is that comes purring around their\r\nboats at the wharf and unties painters and changes the mooring of\r\nevery cat-boat in the cove at night! Ask Francis Lee what it was he\r\nsaw running and leaping up and down the shoal at sunset last Friday!\r\nAsk anybody along the coast what sort of a thing moves about the\r\ncliffs like a man and slides over them into the sea like an otter--\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it do that!\" I burst out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, did you? Well, _what was it?_\"\r\n\r\nSomething kept me silent, although a dozen explanations flew to my\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Halyard said: \"You saw the harbor-master, that's what\r\nyou saw!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him without a word.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mistake me,\" he said, pettishly; \"I don't think that the\r\nharbor-master is a spirit or a sprite or a hobgoblin, or any sort of\r\ndamned rot. Neither do I believe it to be an optical illusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think it is?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a man--I think it's a branch of the human race--that's\r\nwhat I think. Let me tell you something: the deepest spot in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean is a trifle over five miles deep--and I suppose you\r\nknow that this place lies only about a quarter of a mile off this\r\nheadland. The British exploring vessel, _Gull_, Captain Marotte,\r\ndiscovered and sounded it, I believe. Anyway, it's there, and it's my\r\nbelief that the profound depths are inhabited by the remnants of the\r\nlast race of amphibious human beings!\"\r\n\r\nThis was childish; I did not bother to reply.\r\n\r\n\"Believe it or not, as you will,\" he said, angrily; \"one thing I know,\r\nand that is this: the harbor-master has taken to hanging around my\r\ncove, and he is attracted by my nurse! I won't have it! I'll blow his\r\nfishy gills out of his head if I ever get a shot at him! I don't care\r\nwhether it's homicide or not--anyway, it's a new kind of murder and it\r\nattracts me!\"\r\n\r\nI gazed at him incredulously, but he was working himself into a\r\npassion, and I did not choose to say what I thought.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this slate-colored thing with gills goes purring and grinning\r\nand spitting about after my nurse--when she walks, when she rows, when\r\nshe sits on the beach! Gad! It drives me nearly frantic. I won't\r\ntolerate it, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, \"I wouldn't either.\" And I rolled over in bed convulsed\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I heard my door slam. I smothered my mirth and rose to\r\nclose the window, for the land-wind blew cold from the forest, and a\r\ndrizzle was sweeping the carpet as far as my bed.\r\n\r\nThat luminous glare which sometimes lingers after the stars go out,\r\nthrew a trembling, nebulous radiance over sand and cove. I heard the\r\nseething currents under the breakers' softened thunder--louder than I\r\never heard it. Then, as I closed my window, lingering for a last look\r\nat the crawling tide, I saw a man standing, ankle-deep, in the surf,\r\nall alone there in the night. But--was it a man? For the figure\r\nsuddenly began running over the beach on all fours like a beetle,\r\nwaving its limbs like feelers. Before I could throw open the window\r\nagain it darted into the surf, and, when I leaned out into the\r\nchilling drizzle, I saw nothing save the flat ebb crawling on the\r\ncoast--I heard nothing save the purring of bubbles on seething sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took me a week to perfect my arrangements for transporting the\r\ngreat auks, by water, to Port-of-Waves, where a lumber schooner was to\r\nbe sent from Petite Sainte Isole, chartered by me for a voyage to New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nI had constructed a cage made of osiers, in which my auks were to\r\nsquat until they arrived at Bronx Park. My telegrams to Professor\r\nFarrago were brief. One merely said \"Victory!\" Another explained that\r\nI wanted no assistance; and a third read: \"Schooner chartered. Arrive\r\nNew York July 1st. Send furniture-van to foot of Bluff Street.\"\r\n\r\nMy week as a guest of Mr. Halyard proved interesting. I wrangled with\r\nthat invalid to his heart's content, I worked all day on my osier\r\ncage, I hunted the thimble in the moonlight with the pretty nurse. We\r\nsometimes found it.\r\n\r\nAs for the thing they called the harbor-master, I saw it a dozen\r\ntimes, but always either at night or so far away and so close to the\r\nsea that of course no trace of it remained when I reached the spot,\r\nrifle in hand.\r\n\r\nI had quite made up my mind that the so-called harbor-master was a\r\ndemented darky--wandered from, Heaven knows where--perhaps shipwrecked\r\nand gone mad from his sufferings. Still, it was far from pleasant to\r\nknow that the creature was strongly attracted by the pretty nurse.\r\n\r\nShe, however, persisted in regarding the harbor-master as a\r\nsea-creature; she earnestly affirmed that it had gills, like a fish's\r\ngills, that it had a soft, fleshy hole for a mouth, and its eyes were\r\nluminous and lidless and fixed.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" she said, with a shudder, \"it's all slate color, like a\r\nporpoise, and it looks as wet as a sheet of india-rubber in a\r\ndissecting-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe day before I was to set sail with my auks in a cat-boat bound for\r\nPort-of-Waves, Halyard trundled up to me in his chair and announced\r\nhis intention of going with me.\r\n\r\n\"Going where?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"To Port-of-Waves and then to New York,\" he replied, tranquilly.\r\n\r\nI was doubtful, and my lack of cordiality hurt his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course, if you need the sea-voyage--\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"I don't; I need you,\" he said, savagely; \"I need the stimulus of our\r\ndaily quarrel. I never disagreed so pleasantly with anybody in my\r\nlife; it agrees with me; I am a hundred per cent. better than I was\r\nlast week.\"\r\n\r\nI was inclined to resent this, but something in the deep-lined face of\r\nthe invalid softened me. Besides, I had taken a hearty liking to the\r\nold pig.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any mawkish sentiment about it,\" he said, observing me\r\nclosely; \"I won't permit anybody to feel sorry for me--do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll trouble you to use a different tone in addressing me,\" I\r\nreplied, hotly; \"I'll feel sorry for you if I choose to!\" And our\r\nusual quarrel proceeded, to his deep satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock next evening I had Halyard's luggage stowed away in the\r\ncat-boat, and the pretty nurse's effects corded down, with the newly\r\nhatched auk-chicks in a hat-box on top. She and I placed the osier\r\ncage aboard, securing it firmly, and then, throwing tablecloths over\r\nthe auks' heads, we led those simple and dignified birds down the path\r\nand across the plank at the little wooden pier. Together we locked up\r\nthe house, while Halyard stormed at us both and wheeled himself\r\nfuriously up and down the beach below. At the last moment she forgot\r\nher thimble. But we found it, I forget where.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" shouted Halyard, waving his shawls furiously; \"what the\r\ndevil are you about up there?\"\r\n\r\nHe received our explanation with a sniff, and we trundled him aboard\r\nwithout further ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Don't run me across the plank like a steamer trunk!\" he shouted, as I\r\nshot him dexterously into the cock-pit. But the wind was dying away,\r\nand I had no time to dispute with him then.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting above the pine-clad ridge as our sail flapped and\r\npartly filled, and I cast off, and began a long tack, east by south,\r\nto avoid the spouting rocks on our starboard bow.\r\n\r\nThe sea-birds rose in clouds as we swung across the shoal, the black\r\nsurf-ducks scuttered out to sea, the gulls tossed their sun-tipped\r\nwings in the ocean, riding the rollers like bits of froth.\r\n\r\nAlready we were sailing slowly out across that great hole in the\r\nocean, five miles deep, the most profound sounding ever taken in the\r\nAtlantic. The presence of great heights or great depths, seen or\r\nunseen, always impresses the human mind--perhaps oppresses it. We were\r\nvery silent; the sunlight stain on cliff and beach deepened to\r\ncrimson, then faded into sombre purple bloom that lingered long after\r\nthe rose-tint died out in the zenith.\r\n\r\nOur progress was slow; at times, although the sail filled with the\r\nrising land breeze, we scarcely seemed to move at all.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the pretty nurse, \"we couldn't be aground in the\r\ndeepest hole in the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely,\" said Halyard, sarcastically, \"unless we're grounded on a\r\nwhale.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that soft thumping?\" I asked. \"Have we run afoul of a barrel\r\nor log?\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost too dark to see, but I leaned over the rail and swept\r\nthe water with my hand.\r\n\r\nInstantly something smooth glided under it, like the back of a great\r\nfish, and I jerked my hand back to the tiller. At the same moment the\r\nwhole surface of the water seemed to begin to purr, with a sound like\r\nthe breaking of froth in a champagne-glass.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked Halyard, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"A fish came up under my hand,\" I said; \"a porpoise or something--\"\r\n\r\nWith a low cry, the pretty nurse clasped my arm in both her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" she whispered. \"It's purring around the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil's purring?\" shouted Halyard. \"I won't have anything\r\npurring around me!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, to my amazement, I saw that the boat had stopped\r\nentirely, although the sail was full and the small pennant fluttered\r\nfrom the mast-head. Something, too, was tugging at the rudder,\r\ntwisting and jerking it until the tiller strained and creaked in my\r\nhand. All at once it snapped; the tiller swung useless and the boat\r\nwhirled around, heeling in the stiffening wind, and drove shoreward.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I, ducking to escape the boom, caught a glimpse of\r\nsomething ahead--something that a sudden wave seemed to toss on deck\r\nand leave there, wet and flapping--a man with round, fixed, fishy\r\neyes, and soft, slaty skin.\r\n\r\nBut the horror of the thing were the two gills that swelled and\r\nrelaxed spasmodically, emitting a rasping, purring sound--two gasping,\r\nblood-red gills, all fluted and scolloped and distended.\r\n\r\nFrozen with amazement and repugnance, I stared at the creature; I felt\r\nthe hair stirring on my head and the icy sweat on my forehead.\r\n\r\n\"It's the harbor-master!\" screamed Halyard.\r\n\r\nThe harbor-master had gathered himself into a wet lump, squatting\r\nmotionless in the bows under the mast; his lidless eyes were\r\nphosphorescent, like the eyes of living codfish. After a while I felt\r\nthat either fright or disgust was going to strangle me where I sat,\r\nbut it was only the arms of the pretty nurse clasped around me in a\r\nfrenzy of terror.\r\n\r\nThere was not a fire-arm aboard that we could get at. Halyard's hand\r\ncrept backward where a steel-shod boat-hook lay, and I also made a\r\nclutch at it. The next moment I had it in my hand, and staggered\r\nforward, but the boat was already tumbling shoreward among the\r\nbreakers, and the next I knew the harbor-master ran at me like a\r\ncolossal rat, just as the boat rolled over and over through the surf,\r\nspilling freight and passengers among the sea-weed-covered rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself I was thrashing about knee-deep in a rocky pool,\r\nblinded by the water and half suffocated, while under my feet, like a\r\nstranded porpoise, the harbor-master made the water boil in his\r\nefforts to upset me. But his limbs seemed soft and boneless; he had no\r\nnails, no teeth, and he bounced and thumped and flapped and splashed\r\nlike a fish, while I rained blows on him with the boat-hook that\r\nsounded like blows on a football. And all the while his gills were\r\nblowing out and frothing, and purring, and his lidless eyes looked\r\ninto mine, until, nauseated and trembling, I dragged myself back to\r\nthe beach, where already the pretty nurse alternately wrung her hands\r\nand her petticoats in ornamental despair.\r\n\r\nBeyond the cove, Halyard was bobbing up and down, afloat in his\r\ninvalid's chair, trying to steer shoreward. He was the maddest man I\r\never saw.\r\n\r\n\"Have you killed that rubber-headed thing yet?\" he roared.\r\n\r\n\"I can't kill it,\" I shouted, breathlessly. \"I might as well try to\r\nkill a football!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you punch a hole in it?\" he bawled. \"If I can only get at\r\nhim--\"\r\n\r\nHis words were drowned in a thunderous splashing, a roar of great,\r\nbroad flippers beating the sea, and I saw the gigantic forms of my two\r\ngreat auks, followed by their chicks, blundering past in a shower of\r\nspray, driving headlong out into the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord!\" I said. \"I can't stand that,\" and, for the first time in\r\nmy life, I fainted peacefully--and appropriately--at the feet of the\r\npretty nurse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is within the range of possibility that this story may be doubted.\r\nIt doesn't matter; nothing can add to the despair of a man who has\r\nlost two great auks.\r\n\r\nAs for Halyard, nothing affects him--except his involuntary sea-bath,\r\nand that did him so much good that he writes me from the South that\r\nhe's going on a walking-tour through Switzerland--if I'll join him. I\r\nmight have joined him if he had not married the pretty nurse. I wonder\r\nwhether--But, of course, this is no place for speculation.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the harbor-master, you may believe it or not, as you\r\nchoose. But if you hear of any great auks being found, kindly throw a\r\ntable-cloth over their heads and notify the authorities at the new\r\nZoological Gardens in Bronx Park, New York. The reward is ten thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed any further, common decency requires me to reassure\r\nmy readers concerning my intentions, which, Heaven knows, are far from\r\nflippant.\r\n\r\nTo separate fact from fancy has always been difficult for me, but now\r\nthat I have had the honor to be chosen secretary of the Zoological\r\nGardens in Bronx Park, I realize keenly that unless I give up writing\r\nfiction nobody will believe what I write about science. Therefore it\r\nis to a serious and unimaginative public that I shall hereafter\r\naddress myself; and I do it in the modest confidence that I shall\r\nneither be distrusted nor doubted, although unfortunately I still\r\nwrite in that irrational style which suggests covert frivolity, and\r\nfor which I am undergoing a course of treatment in English literature\r\nat Columbia College. Now, having promised to avoid originality and\r\nconfine myself to facts, I shall tell what I have to tell concerning\r\nthe dingue, the mammoth, and--something else.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks it had been rumored that Professor Farrago, president\r\nof the Bronx Park Zoological Society, would resign, to accept an\r\nenormous salary as manager of Barnum & Bailey's circus. He was now\r\nwith the circus in London, and had promised to cable his decision\r\nbefore the day was over.\r\n\r\nI hoped he would decide to remain with us. I was his secretary and\r\nparticular favorite, and I viewed, without enthusiasm, the advent of a\r\nnew president, who might shake us all out of our congenial and\r\ncarefully excavated ruts. However, it was plain that the trustees of\r\nthe society expected the resignation of Professor Farrago, for they\r\nhad been in secret session all day, considering the names of possible\r\ncandidates to fill Professor Farrago's large, old-fashioned shoes.\r\nThese preparations worried me, for I could scarcely expect another\r\nchief as kind and considerate as Professor Leonidas Farrago.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon in June I left my office in the Administration Building\r\nin Bronx Park and strolled out under the trees for a breath of air.\r\nBut the heat of the sun soon drove me to seek shelter under a little\r\nsquare arbor, a shady retreat covered with purple wistaria and\r\nhoneysuckle. As I entered the arbor I noticed that there were three\r\nother people seated there--an elderly lady with masculine features and\r\nshort hair, a younger lady sitting beside her, and, farther away, a\r\nrough-looking young man reading a book.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I had an indistinct impression of having met the elder\r\nlady somewhere, and under circumstances not entirely agreeable, but\r\nbeyond a stony and indifferent glance she paid no attention to me. As\r\nfor the younger lady, she did not look at me at all. She was very\r\nyoung, with pretty eyes, a mass of silky brown hair, and a skin as\r\nfresh as a rose which had just been rained on.\r\n\r\nWith that delicacy peculiar to lonely scientific bachelors, I modestly\r\nsat down beside the rough young man, although there was more room\r\nbeside the younger lady. \"Some lazy loafer reading a penny dreadful,\"\r\nI thought, glancing at him, then at the title of his book. Hearing me\r\nbeside him, he turned around and blinked over his shabby shoulder, and\r\nthe movement uncovered the page he had been silently conning. The\r\nvolume in his hands was Darwin's famous monograph on the monodactyl.\r\n\r\nHe noticed the astonishment on my face and smiled uneasily, shifting\r\nthe short clay pipe in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I guess,\" he observed, \"that this here book is too much for me,\r\nmister.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather technical,\" I replied, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, in vague admiration; \"it's fierce, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nAfter a silence I asked him if he would tell me why he had chosen\r\nDarwin as a literary pastime.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, placidly, \"I was tryin' to read about annermals, but\r\nI'm up against a word-slinger this time all right. Now here's a\r\ngum-twister,\" and he painfully spelled out m-o-n-o-d-a-c-t-y-l,\r\nbreathing hard all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Monodactyl,\" I said, \"means a single-toed creature.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the page with alacrity. \"Is that the beast he's talkin'\r\nabout?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe illustration he pointed out was a wood-cut representing Darwin's\r\nreconstruction of the dingue from the fossil bones in the British\r\nMuseum. It was a well-executed wood-cut, showing a dingue in the\r\nforeground and, to give scale, a mammoth in the middle distance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"that is the dingue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen one,\" he observed, calmly.\r\n\r\nI smiled and explained that the dingue had been extinct for some\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess not,\" he replied, with cool optimism. Then he placed a\r\ngrimy forefinger on the mammoth.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen them things, too,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nAgain I patiently pointed out his error, and suggested that he\r\nreferred to the elephant.\r\n\r\n\"Elephant be blowed!\" he replied, scornfully. \"I guess I know what I\r\nseen. An' I seen that there thing you call a dingue, too.\"\r\n\r\nNot wishing to prolong a futile discussion, I remained silent. After a\r\nmoment he wheeled around, removing his pipe from his hard mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear tell of Graham's Glacier?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, astonished; \"it's the southernmost glacier in\r\nBritish America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" he said. \"And did you ever hear tell of the Hudson Mountings,\r\nmister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"What's behind 'em?\" he snapped out.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows,\" I answered. \"They are considered impassable.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ain't, though,\" he said, doggedly; \"I've been behind 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\" I replied, tiring of his yarn.\r\n\r\n\"Ya-as, reely,\" he repeated, sullenly. Then he began to fumble and\r\nsearch through the pages of his book until he found what he wanted.\r\n\"Mister,\" he said, \"jest read that out loud, please.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage he indicated was the famous chapter beginning:\r\n\r\n    \"Is the mammoth extinct? Is the dingue extinct? Probably. And\r\n    yet the aborigines of British America maintain the contrary.\r\n    Probably both the mammoth and the dingue are extinct; but\r\n    until expeditions have penetrated and explored not only the\r\n    unknown region in Alaska but also that hidden table-land\r\n    beyond the Graham Glacier and the Hudson Mountains, it will\r\n    not be possible to definitely announce the total extinction of\r\n    either the mammoth or the dingue.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had read it, slowly, for his benefit, he brought his hand down\r\nsmartly on one knee and nodded rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Mister,\" he said, \"that gent knows a thing or two, and don't you\r\nforgit it!\" Then he demanded, abruptly, how I knew he hadn't been\r\nbehind the Graham Glacier.\r\n\r\nI explained.\r\n\r\n\"Shucks!\" he said; \"there's a road five miles wide inter that there\r\ntable-land. Mister, I ain't been in New York long; I come inter port a\r\nweek ago on the _Arctic Belle_, whaler. I was in the Hudson range when\r\nthat there Graham Glacier bust up--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know it?\" he asked. \"Well, mebbe it ain't in the papers,\r\nbut it busted all right--blowed up by a earthquake an' volcano\r\ncombine. An', mister, it was oreful. My, how I did run!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me that some convulsion of the earth has\r\nshattered the Graham Glacier?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Convulsions? Ya-as, an' fits, too,\" he said, sulkily. \"The hull blame\r\nthing dropped inter a hole. An' say, mister, home an' mother is good\r\nenough fur me now.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"Once,\" he said, \"I ketched pelts fur them sharps at Hudson Bay, like\r\nany yaller husky, but the things I seen arter that convulsion-fit--the\r\n_things I seen behind the Hudson Mountings_--don't make me hanker\r\narter no life on the pe-rarie wild, lemme tell yer. I may be a Mother\r\nCarey chicken, but this chicken has got enough.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long silence I picked up his book again and pointed at the\r\npicture of the mammoth.\r\n\r\n\"What color is it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kinder red an' brown,\" he answered, promptly. \"It's woolly, too.\"\r\n\r\nAstounded, I pointed to the dingue.\r\n\r\n\"One-toed,\" he said, quickly; \"makes a noise like a bell when\r\nscutterin' about.\"\r\n\r\nIntensely excited, I laid my hand on his arm. \"My society will give\r\nyou a thousand dollars,\" I said, \"if you pilot me inside the Hudson\r\ntable-land and show me either a mammoth or a dingue!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked me calmly in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Mister,\" he said, slowly, \"have you got a million for to squander on\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he went on, \"it wouldn't be enough. Home an' mother suits\r\nme now.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his book and rose. In vain I asked his name and address;\r\nin vain I begged him to dine with me--to become my honored guest.\r\n\r\n\"Nit,\" he said, shortly, and shambled off down the path.\r\n\r\nBut I was not going to lose him like that. I rose and deliberately\r\nstarted to stalk him. It was easy. He shuffled along, pulling on his\r\npipe, and I after him.\r\n\r\nIt was growing a little dark, although the sun still reddened the tops\r\nof the maples. Afraid of losing him in the falling dusk, I once more\r\napproached him and laid my hand upon his ragged sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he cried, wheeling about, \"I want you to quit follerin'\r\nme. Don't I tell you money can't make me go back to them mountings!\"\r\nAnd as I attempted to speak, he suddenly tore off his cap and pointed\r\nto his head. His hair was white as snow.\r\n\r\n\"That's what come of monkeyin' inter your cursed mountings,\" he\r\nshouted, fiercely. \"There's things in there what no Christian oughter\r\nsee. Lemme alone er I'll bust yer.\"\r\n\r\nHe shambled on, doubled fists swinging by his side. The next moment,\r\nsetting my teeth obstinately, I followed him and caught him by the\r\npark gate. At my hail he whirled around with a snarl, but I grabbed\r\nhim by the throat and backed him violently against the park wall.\r\n\r\n\"You invaluable ruffian,\" I said, \"now you listen to me. I live in\r\nthat big stone building, and I'll give you a thousand dollars to take\r\nme behind the Graham Glacier. Think it over and call on me when you\r\nare in a pleasanter frame of mind. If you don't come by noon to-morrow\r\nI'll go to the Graham Glacier without you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was attempting to kick me all the time, but I managed to avoid him,\r\nand when I had finished I gave him a shove which almost loosened his\r\nspinal column. He went reeling out across the sidewalk, and when he\r\nhad recovered his breath and his balance he danced with displeasure\r\nand displayed a vocabulary that astonished me. However, he kept his\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAs I turned back into the park, satisfied that he would not follow,\r\nthe first person I saw was the elderly, stony-faced lady of the\r\nwistaria arbor advancing on tiptoe. Behind her came the younger lady\r\nwith cheeks like a rose that had been rained on.\r\n\r\nInstantly it occurred to me that they had followed us, and at the same\r\nmoment I knew who the stony-faced lady was. Angry, but polite, I\r\nlifted my hat and saluted her, and she, probably furious at having\r\nbeen caught tip-toeing after me, cut me dead. The younger lady passed\r\nme with face averted, but even in the dusk I could see the tip of one\r\nlittle ear turn scarlet.\r\n\r\nWalking on hurriedly, I entered the Administration Building, and found\r\nProfessor Lesard, of the reptilian department, preparing to leave.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it,\" I said, sharply; \"I've got exciting news.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm only going to the theatre,\" he replied. \"It's a good show--Adam\r\nand Eve; there's a snake in it, you know. It's in my line.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" I said; and I told him briefly what had occurred in\r\nthe arbor.\r\n\r\n\"But that's not all,\" I continued, savagely. \"Those women followed us,\r\nand who do you think one of them turned out to be? Well, it was\r\nProfessor Smawl, of Barnard College, and I'll bet every pair of boots\r\nI own that she starts for the Graham Glacier within a week. Idiot that\r\nI was!\" I exclaimed, smiting my head with both hands. \"I never\r\nrecognized her until I saw her tip-toeing and craning her neck to\r\nlisten. Now she knows about the glacier; she heard every word that\r\nyoung ruffian said, and she'll go to the glacier if it's only to\r\nforestall me.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Lesard looked anxious. He knew that Miss Smawl, professor of\r\nnatural history at Barnard College, had long desired an appointment\r\nat the Bronx Park gardens. It was even said she had a chance of\r\nsucceeding Professor Farrago as president, but that, of course, must\r\nhave been a joke. However, she haunted the gardens, annoying the\r\nkeepers by persistently poking the animals with her umbrella. On one\r\noccasion she sent us word that she desired to enter the tigers'\r\nenclosure for the purpose of making experiments in hypnotism.\r\nProfessor Farrago was absent, but I took it upon myself to send back\r\nword that I feared the tigers might injure her. The miserable small\r\nboy who took my message informed her that I was afraid she might\r\ninjure the tigers, and the unpleasant incident almost cost me my\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite convinced,\" said I to Professor Lesard, \"that Miss Smawl\r\nis perfectly capable of abusing the information she overheard, and of\r\nstarting herself to explore a region that, by all the laws of decency,\r\njustice, and prior claim, belongs to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lesard, with a peculiar laugh, \"it's not certain whether\r\nyou can go at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Farrago will authorize me,\" I said, confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Farrago has resigned,\" said Lesard. It was a bolt from a\r\nclear sky.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" I blurted out. \"What will become of the rest of us,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"The trustees are holding a meeting over\r\nin the Administration Building to elect a new president for us. It\r\ndepends on the new president what becomes of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lesard,\" I said, hoarsely, \"you don't suppose that they could\r\npossibly elect Miss Smawl as our president, do you?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me askance and bit his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be in a nice position, wouldn't I?\" said I, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"The lady would probably make you walk the plank for that tiger\r\nbusiness,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't do it,\" I protested, with sickly eagerness. \"Besides, I\r\nexplained to her--\"\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, and I stared at him, appalled by the possibility of\r\nreporting to Professor Smawl for instructions next morning.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Lesard,\" I said, nervously, \"I wish you would step over to\r\nthe Administration Building and ask the trustees if I may prepare for\r\nthis expedition. Will you?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at me sympathetically. It was quite natural for me to wish\r\nto secure my position before the new president was elected--especially\r\nas there was a chance of the new president being Miss Smawl.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right,\" he said; \"the Graham Glacier would be the\r\nsafest place for you if our next president is to be the Lady of the\r\nTigers.\" And he started across the park puffing his cigar.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the doorstep to wait for his return, not at all charmed\r\nwith the prospect. It made me furious, too, to see my ambition nipped\r\nwith the frost of a possible veto from Miss Smawl.\r\n\r\n\"If she is elected,\" thought I, \"there is nothing for me but to\r\nresign--to avoid the inconvenience of being shown the door. Oh, I wish\r\nI had allowed her to hypnotize the tigers!\"\r\n\r\nThoughts of crime flitted through my mind. Miss Smawl would not remain\r\npresident--or anything else very long--if she persisted in her desire\r\nfor the tigers. And then when she called for help I would pretend not\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\nAroused from criminal meditation by the return of Professor Lesard, I\r\njumped up and peered into his perplexed eyes. \"They've elected a\r\npresident,\" he said, \"but they won't tell us who the president is\r\nuntil to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think--\" I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But I know this: the new president sanctions the\r\nexpedition to the Graham Glacier, and directs you to choose an\r\nassistant and begin preparations for four people.\"\r\n\r\nOverjoyed, I seized his hand and said, \"Hurray!\" in a voice weak with\r\nemotion. \"The old dragon isn't elected this time,\" I added,\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"By-the-way,\" he said, \"who was the other dragon with her in the park\r\nthis evening?\"\r\n\r\nI described her in a more modulated voice.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" observed Professor Lesard, \"that must be her assistant,\r\nProfessor Dorothy Van Twiller! She's the prettiest blue-stocking in\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nWith this curious remark my confrère followed me into my room and\r\nwrote down the list of articles I dictated to him. The list included a\r\ncomplete camping equipment for myself and three other men.\r\n\r\n\"Am I one of those other men?\" inquired Lesard, with an unhappy smile.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply my door was shoved open and a figure appeared at\r\nthe threshold, cap in hand.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, sternly; but my heart was beating high\r\nwith triumph.\r\n\r\nThe figure shuffled; then came a subdued voice:\r\n\r\n\"Mister, I guess I'll go back to the Graham Glacier along with you.\r\nI'm Billy Spike, an' it kinder scares me to go back to them Hudson\r\nMountains, but somehow, mister, when you choked me and kinder walked\r\nme off on my ear, why, mister, I kinder took to you like.\"\r\n\r\nThere was absolute silence for a minute; then he said:\r\n\r\n\"So if you go, I guess I'll go, too, mister.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a thousand dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fur nawthin',\" he muttered--\"or what you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Billy,\" I said, briskly; \"just look over those rifles and\r\nammunition and see that everything's sound.\"\r\n\r\nHe slowly lifted his tough young face and gave me a doglike glance.\r\nThey were hard eyes, but there was gratitude in them.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get your throat slit,\" whispered Lesard.\r\n\r\n\"Not while Billy's with me,\" I replied, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nLate that night, as I was preparing for pleasant dreams, a knock came\r\non my door and a telegraph-messenger handed me a note, which I read,\r\nshivering in my bare feet, although the thermometer marked eighty\r\nFahrenheit:\r\n\r\n    \"You will immediately leave for the Hudson Mountains via\r\n    Wellman Bay, Labrador, there to await further instructions.\r\n    Equipment for yourself and one assistant will include\r\n    following articles\" [here began a list of camping utensils,\r\n    scientific paraphernalia, and provisions]. \"The steamer\r\n    _Penguin_ sails at five o'clock to-morrow morning. Kindly find\r\n    yourself on board at that hour. Any excuse for not complying\r\n    with these orders will be accepted as your resignation.\r\n\r\n                \"SUSAN SMAWL,\r\n             \"President Bronx Zoological Society.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lesard!\" I shouted, trembling with fury.\r\n\r\nHe appeared at his door, chastely draped in pajamas; and he read the\r\ninsolent letter with terrified alacrity.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do--resign?\" he asked, much frightened.\r\n\r\n\"Do!\" I snarled, grinding my teeth; \"I'm going--that's what I'm going\r\nto do!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but you can't get ready and catch that steamer, too,\" he\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\nHe did not know me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that one calm evening towards the end of June,\r\nWilliam Spike and I went into camp under the southerly shelter of that\r\nvast granite wall called the Hudson Mountains, there to await the\r\npromised \"further instructions.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been a tiresome trip by steamer to Anticosti, from there by\r\nschooner to Widgeon Bay, then down the coast and up the Cape Clear\r\nRiver to Port Porpoise. There we bought three pack-mules and started\r\ndue north on the Great Fur Trail. The second day out we passed Fort\r\nBoisé, the last outpost of civilization, and on the sixth day we were\r\ntravelling eastward under the granite mountain parapets.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the sixth day out from Fort Boisé we went into camp\r\nfor the last time before entering the unknown land.\r\n\r\nI could see it already through my field-glasses, and while William was\r\nbuilding the fire I climbed up among the rocks above and sat down,\r\nglasses levelled, to study the prospect.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing either extraordinary or forbidding in the landscape\r\nwhich stretched out beyond; to the right the solid palisade of granite\r\ncut off the view; to the left the palisade continued, an endless\r\nbarrier of sheer cliffs crowned with pine and hemlock. But the\r\ninteresting section of the landscape lay almost directly in front of\r\nme--a rent in the mountain-wall through which appeared to run a level,\r\narid plain, miles wide, and as smooth and even as a highroad.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt concerning the significance of that rent in\r\nthe solid mountain-wall; and, moreover, it was exactly as William\r\nSpike had described it. However, I called to him and he came up from\r\nthe smoky camp-fire, axe on shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Yep,\" he said, squatting beside me; \"the Graham Glacier used to\r\nmeander through that there hole, but somethin' went wrong with the\r\nearth's in'ards an' there was a bust-up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you saw it, William?\" I said, with a sigh of envy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey? Seen it? Sure I seen it! I was to Spoutin' Springs, twenty mile\r\nwest, with a bale o' blue fox an' otter pelt. Fust I knew them geysers\r\nbegun for to groan egregious like, an' I seen the caribou gallopin'\r\nhell-bent south. 'This climate,' sez I, 'is too bracin' for me,' so I\r\nstruck a back trail an' landed onto a hill. Then them geysers blowed\r\nup, one arter the next, an' I heard somethin' kinder cave in between\r\nhere an' China. I disremember things what happened. Somethin' throwed\r\nme down, but I couldn't stay there, for the blamed ground was runnin'\r\nlike a river--all wavy-like, an' the sky hit me on the back o' me\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" I urged, in that new excitement which every repetition of\r\nthe story revived. I had heard it all twenty times since we left New\r\nYork, but mere repetition could not apparently satisfy me.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued William, \"the whole world kinder went off like a\r\nfire-cracker, an' I come too, an' ran like--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said I, cutting him short, for I had become wearied of the\r\ninvariable profanity which lent a lurid ending to his narrative.\r\n\r\n\"After that,\" I continued, \"you went through the rent in the\r\nmountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you saw a dingue and a creature that resembled a mammoth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he repeated, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"And you saw something else?\" I always asked this question; it\r\nfascinated me to see the sullen fright flicker in William's eyes, and\r\nthe mechanical backward glance, as though what he had seen might still\r\nbe behind him.\r\n\r\nHe had never answered this third question but once, and that time he\r\nfairly snarled in my face as he growled: \"I seen what no Christian\r\noughter see.\"\r\n\r\nSo when I repeated: \"And you saw something else, William?\" he gave me\r\na wicked, frightened leer, and shuffled off to feed the mules.\r\nFlattery, entreaties, threats left him unmoved; he never told me what\r\nthe third thing was that he had seen behind the Hudson Mountains.\r\n\r\nWilliam had retired to mix up with his mules; I resumed my binoculars\r\nand my silent inspection of the great, smooth path left by the Graham\r\nGlacier when something or other exploded that vast mass of ice into\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nThe arid plain wound out from the unknown country like a river, and I\r\nthought then, and think now, that when the glacier was blown into\r\nvapor the vapor descended in the most terrific rain the world has ever\r\nseen, and poured through the newly blasted mountain-gateway, sweeping\r\nthe earth to bed-rock. To corroborate this theory, miles to the\r\nsouthward I could see the débris winding out across the land towards\r\nWellman Bay, but as the terminal moraine of the vanished glacier\r\nformerly ended there I could not be certain that my theory was\r\ncorrect. Owing to the formation of the mountains I could not see more\r\nthan half a mile into the unknown country. What I could see appeared\r\nto be nothing but the continuation of the glacier's path, scored out\r\nby the cloud-burst, and swept as smooth as a floor.\r\n\r\nSitting there, my heart beating heavily with excitement, I looked\r\nthrough the evening glow at the endless, pine-crowned mountain-wall\r\nwith its giant's gateway pierced for me! And I thought of all the\r\nexplorers and the unknown heroes--trappers, Indians, humble\r\nnaturalists, perhaps--who had attempted to scale that sheer barricade\r\nand had died there or failed, beaten back from those eternal cliffs.\r\nEternal? No! For the Eternal Himself had struck the rock, and it had\r\nsprung asunder, thundering obedience.\r\n\r\nIn the still evening air the smoke from the fire below mounted in a\r\nstraight, slender pillar, like the smoke from those ancient altars\r\nbuilded before the first blood had been shed on earth.\r\n\r\nThe evening wind stirred the pines; a tiny spring brook made thin\r\nharmony among the rocks; a murmur came from the quiet camp. It was\r\nWilliam adjuring his mules. In the deepening twilight I descended the\r\nhillock, stepping cautiously among the rocks.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, as I stood outside the reddening ring of firelight,\r\nfar in the depths of the unknown country, far behind the\r\nmountain-wall, a sound grew on the quiet air. William heard it and\r\nturned his face to the mountains. The sound faded to a vibration which\r\nwas felt, not heard. Then once more I began to divine a vibration in\r\nthe air, gathering in distant volume until it became a sound, lasting\r\nthe space of a spoken word, fading to vibration, then silence.\r\n\r\nWas it a cry?\r\n\r\nI looked at William inquiringly. He had quietly fainted away.\r\n\r\nI got him to the little brook and poked his head into the icy water,\r\nand after a while he sat up pluckily.\r\n\r\nTo an indignant question he replied: \"Naw, I ain't a-cussin' you.\r\nLemme be or I'll have fits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it that sound that scared you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ya-as,\" he replied with a dauntless shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Was it the voice of the mammoth?\" I persisted, excitedly. \"Speak,\r\nWilliam, or I'll drag you about and kick you!\"\r\n\r\nHe replied that it was neither a mammoth nor a dingue, and added a\r\nstrong request for privacy, which I was obliged to grant, as I could\r\nnot torture another word out of him.\r\n\r\nI slept little that night; the exciting proximity of the unknown land\r\nwas too much for me. But although I lay awake for hours, I heard\r\nnothing except the tinkle of water among the rocks and the plover\r\ncalling from some hidden marsh. At daybreak I shot a ptarmigan which\r\nhad walked into camp, and the shot set the echoes yelling among the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nWilliam, sullen and heavy-eyed, dressed the bird, and we broiled it\r\nfor breakfast.\r\n\r\nNeither he nor I alluded to the sound we had heard the night before;\r\nhe boiled water and cleaned up the mess-kit, and I pottered about\r\namong the rocks for another ptarmigan. Wearying of this, presently, I\r\nreturned to the mules and William, and sat down for a smoke.\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me,\" I said, \"that our instructions to 'await further\r\norders' are idiotic. How are we to receive 'further orders' here?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam did not know.\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose,\" said I, in sudden disgust, \"that Miss Smawl\r\nbelieves there is a summer hotel and daily mail service in the Hudson\r\nMountains?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam thought perhaps she did suppose something of the sort.\r\n\r\nIt irritated me beyond measure to find myself at last on the very\r\nborder of the unknown country, and yet checked, held back, by the\r\nirresponsible orders of a maiden lady named Smawl. However, my salary\r\ndepended upon the whim of that maiden lady, and although I fussed and\r\nfumed and glared at the mountains through my glasses, I realized that\r\nI could not stir without the permission of Miss Smawl. At times this\r\ngrotesque situation became almost unbearable, and I often went away by\r\nmyself and indulged in fantasies, firing my gun off and pretending I\r\nhad hit Miss Smawl by mistake. At such moments I would imagine I was\r\nfree at last to plunge into the strange country, and I would squat on\r\na rock and dream of bagging my first mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe time passed heavily; the tension increased with each new day. I\r\nshot ptarmigan and kept our table supplied with brook-trout. William\r\nchopped wood, conversed with his mules, and cooked very badly.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" I said, one morning; \"we have been in camp a week to-day,\r\nand I can't stand your cooking another minute!\"\r\n\r\nWilliam, who was washing a saucepan, looked up and begged me\r\nsarcastically to accept the _cordon bleu_. But I know only how to cook\r\neggs, and there were no eggs within some hundred miles.\r\n\r\nTo get the flavor of the breakfast out of my mouth I walked up to my\r\nfavorite hillock and sat down for a smoke. The next moment, however, I\r\nwas on my feet, cheering excitedly and shouting for William.\r\n\r\n\"Here come 'further instructions' at last!\" I cried, pointing to the\r\nsouthward, where two dots on the grassy plain were imperceptibly\r\nmoving in our direction.\r\n\r\n\"People on mules,\" said William, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"They must be messengers for us!\" I cried, in chaste joy. \"Three\r\ncheers for the northward trail, William, and the mischief take\r\nMiss--Well, never mind now,\" I added.\r\n\r\n\"On them approachin' mules,\" observed William, \"there is wimmen.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him for a second, then attempted to strike him. He dodged\r\nwearily and repeated his incredible remark: \"Ya-as, there\r\nis--wimmen--two female ladies onto them there mules.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring me my glasses!\" I said, hoarsely; \"bring me those glasses,\r\nWilliam, because I shall destroy you if you don't!\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat awed by my calm fury, he hastened back to camp and returned\r\nwith the binoculars. It was a breathless moment. I adjusted the lenses\r\nwith a steady hand and raised them.\r\n\r\nNow, of all unexpected sights my fate may reserve for me in the\r\nfuture, I trust--nay, I know--that none can ever prove as unwelcome as\r\nthe sight I perceived through my binoculars. For upon the backs of\r\nthose distant mules were two women, and the first one was Miss Smawl!\r\n\r\nUpon her head she wore a helmet, from which fluttered a green veil.\r\nOtherwise she was clothed in tweeds; and at moments she beat upon her\r\nmule with a thick umbrella.\r\n\r\nSurfeited with the sickening spectacle, I sat down on a rock and tried\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\n\"I told yer so,\" observed William; but I was too tired to attack him.\r\n\r\nWhen the caravan rode into camp I was myself again, smilingly prepared\r\nfor the worst, and I advanced, cap in hand, followed furtively by\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" I said, violently injecting joy into my voice. \"Welcome,\r\nProfessor Smawl, to the Hudson Mountains!\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly take my mule,\" she said, climbing down to mother earth.\r\n\r\n\"William,\" I said, with dignity, \"take the lady's mule.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smawl gave me a stolid glance, then made directly for the\r\ncamp-fire, where a kettle of game-broth simmered over the coals. The\r\nlast I saw of her she was smelling of it, and I turned my back and\r\nadvanced towards the second lady pilgrim, prepared to be civil until\r\nsnubbed.\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite certain that never before had William Spike or I\r\nbeheld so much feminine loveliness in one human body on the back of a\r\nmule. She was clad in the daintiest of shooting-kilts, yet there was\r\nnothing mannish about her except the way she rode the mule, and that\r\nonly accentuated her adorable femininity.\r\n\r\nI remembered what Professor Lesard had said about blue stockings--but\r\nMiss Dorothy Van Twiller's were gray, turned over at the tops, and\r\ndisappearing into canvas spats buckled across a pair of slim\r\nshooting-boots.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" said I, attempting to restrain a too violent cordiality.\r\n\"Welcome, Professor Van Twiller, to the Hudson Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she replied, accepting my assistance very sweetly; \"it is\r\na pleasure to meet a human being again.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at Miss Smawl. She was eating game-broth, but she resembled\r\na human being in a general way.\r\n\r\n\"I should very much like to wash my hands,\" said Professor Van\r\nTwiller, drawing the buckskin gloves from her slim fingers.\r\n\r\nI brought towels and soap and conducted her to the brook.\r\n\r\nShe called to Professor Smawl to join her, and her voice was\r\ncrystalline; Professor Smawl declined, and her voice was batrachian.\r\n\r\n\"She is so hungry!\" observed Miss Van Twiller. \"I am very thankful we\r\nare here at last, for we've had a horrid time. You see, we neither of\r\nus know how to cook.\"\r\n\r\nI wondered what they would say to William's cooking, but I held my\r\npeace and retired, leaving the little brook to mirror the sweetest\r\nface that was ever bathed in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon our expedition, in two sections, moved forward. The\r\nfirst section comprised myself and all the mules; the second section\r\nwas commanded by Professor Smawl, followed by Professor Van Twiller,\r\narmed with a tiny shot-gun. William, loaded down with the ladies'\r\ntoilet articles, skulked in the rear. I say skulked; there was no\r\nother word for it.\r\n\r\n\"So you're a guide, are you?\" observed Professor Smawl when William,\r\ncap in hand, had approached her with well-meant advice. \"The woods are\r\nfull of lazy guides. Pick up those Gladstone bags! I'll do the guiding\r\nfor this expedition.\"\r\n\r\nMade cautious by William's humiliation, I associated with the mules\r\nexclusively. Nevertheless, Professor Smawl had her hard eyes on me,\r\nand I realized she meant mischief.\r\n\r\nThe encounter took place just as I, driving the five mules, entered\r\nthe great mountain gateway, thrilled with anticipation which almost\r\namounted to foreboding. As I was about to set foot across the\r\nimaginary frontier which divided the world from the unknown land,\r\nProfessor Smawl hailed me and I halted until she came up.\r\n\r\n\"As commander of this expedition,\" she said, somewhat out of breath,\r\n\"I desire to be the first living creature who has ever set foot\r\nbehind the Graham Glacier. Kindly step aside, young sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said I, rigid with disappointment, \"my guide, William Spike,\r\nentered that unknown land a year ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _says_ he did,\" sneered Professor Smawl.\r\n\r\n\"As you like,\" I replied; \"but it is scarcely generous to forestall\r\nthe person whose stupidity gave you the clew to this unexplored\r\nregion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean yourself?\" she asked, with a stony stare.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said I, firmly.\r\n\r\nHer little, hard eyes grew harder, and she clutched her umbrella until\r\nthe steel ribs crackled.\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" she said, insolently; \"if I could have gotten rid of you\r\nI should have done so the day I was appointed president. But Professor\r\nFarrago refused to resign unless your position was assured, subject,\r\nof course, to your good behavior. Frankly, I don't like you, and I\r\nconsider your views on science ridiculous, and if an opportunity\r\npresents itself I will be most happy to request your resignation.\r\nKindly collect your mules and follow me.\"\r\n\r\nMortified beyond measure, I collected my mules and followed my\r\npresident into the strange country behind the Hudson Mountains--I who\r\nhad aspired to lead, compelled to follow in the rear, driving mules.\r\n\r\nThe journey was monotonous at first, but we shortly ascended a ridge\r\nfrom which we could see, stretching out below us, the wilderness\r\nwhere, save the feet of William Spike, no human feet had passed.\r\n\r\nAs for me, tingling with enthusiasm, I forgot my chagrin, I forgot the\r\ngross injustice, I forgot my mules. \"Excelsior!\" I cried, running up\r\nand down the ridge in uncontrollable excitement at the sublime\r\nspectacle of forest, mountain, and valley all set with little lakes.\r\n\r\n\"Excelsior!\" repeated an excited voice at my side, and Professor Van\r\nTwiller sprang to the ridge beside me, her eyes bright as stars.\r\n\r\nExalted, inspired by the mysterious beauty of the view, we clasped\r\nhands and ran up and down the grassy ridge.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said Professor Smawl, coldly, as we raced about like a\r\npair of distracted kittens. The chilling voice broke the spell; I\r\ndropped Professor Van Twiller's hand and sat down on a bowlder, aching\r\nwith wrath.\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon we halted beside a tiny lake, deep in the unknown\r\nwilderness, where purple and scarlet bergamot choked the shores and\r\nthe spruce-partridge strutted fearlessly under our very feet. Here we\r\npitched our two tents. The afternoon sun slanted through the pines;\r\nthe lake glittered; acres of golden brake perfumed the forest silence,\r\nbroken only at rare intervals by the distant thunder of a partridge\r\ndrumming.\r\n\r\nProfessor Smawl ate heavily and retired to her tent to lie torpid\r\nuntil evening. William drove the unloaded mules into an intervale full\r\nof sun-cured, fragrant grasses; I sat down beside Professor Van\r\nTwiller.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness is electric. Once within the influence of its currents,\r\nhuman beings become positively or negatively charged, violently\r\nattracting or repelling each other.\r\n\r\n\"There is something the matter with this air,\" said Professor Van\r\nTwiller. \"It makes me feel as though I were desperately enamoured of\r\nthe entire human race.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned back against a pine, smiling vaguely, and crossing one knee\r\nover the other.\r\n\r\nNow I am not bold by temperament, and, normally, I fear ladies.\r\nTherefore it surprised me to hear myself begin a frivolous _causerie_,\r\nreplying to her pretty epigrams with epigrams of my own, advancing to\r\nthe borderland of badinage, fearlessly conducting her and myself over\r\nthat delicate frontier to meet upon the terrain of undisguised\r\nflirtation.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that she was out for a holiday. The seriousness and\r\nrestraints of twenty-two years she had left behind her in the\r\ncivilized world, and now, with a shrug of her young shoulders, she\r\nunloosened her burden of reticence, dignity, and responsibility and\r\nlet the whole load fall with a discreet thud.\r\n\r\n\"Even hares go mad in March,\" she said, seriously. \"I know you intend\r\nto flirt with me--and I don't care. Anyway, there's nothing else to\r\ndo, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said I, solemnly, \"I should take you behind that big tree\r\nand attempt to kiss you!\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect did not appear to appall her, so I looked around with\r\nthat sneaking yet conciliatory caution peculiar to young men who are\r\nnovices in the art. Before I had satisfied myself that neither William\r\nnor the mules were observing us, Professor Van Twiller rose to her\r\nfeet and took a short step backward.\r\n\r\n\"Let's set traps for a dingue,\" she said, \"will you?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the big tree, undecided. \"Come on,\" she said; \"I'll show\r\nyou how.\" And away we went into the woods, she leading, her kilts\r\nflashing through the golden half-light.\r\n\r\nNow I had not the faintest notion how to trap the dingue, but\r\nProfessor Van Twiller asserted that it formerly fed on the tender tips\r\nof the spruce, quoting Darwin as her authority.\r\n\r\nSo we gathered a bushel of spruce-tips, piled them on the bank of a\r\nlittle stream, then built a miniature stockade around the bait, a foot\r\nhigh. I roofed this with hemlock, then laboriously whittled out and\r\nadjusted a swinging shutter for the entrance, setting it on springy\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\n\"The dingue, you know, was supposed to live in the water,\" she said,\r\nkneeling beside me over our trap.\r\n\r\nI took her little hand and thanked her for the information.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" she said, enthusiastically, \"a dingue will come out of\r\nthe lake to-night to feed on our spruce-tips. Then,\" she added, \"we've\r\ngot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"True!\" I said, earnestly, and pressed her fingers very gently.\r\n\r\nHer face was turned a little away; I don't remember what she said; I\r\ndon't remember that she said anything. A faint rose-tint stole over\r\nher cheek. A few moments later she said: \"You must not do that again.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite late when we strolled back to camp. Long before we came\r\nin sight of the twin tents we heard a deep voice bawling our names. It\r\nwas Professor Smawl, and she pounced upon Dorothy and drove her\r\nignominiously into the tent.\r\n\r\n\"As for you,\" she said, in hollow tones, \"you may explain your\r\nconduct at once, or place your resignation at my disposal.\"\r\n\r\nBut somehow or other I appeared to be temporarily lost to shame, and I\r\nonly smiled at my infuriated president, and entered my own tent with a\r\nstep that was distinctly frolicsome.\r\n\r\n\"Billy,\" said I to William Spike, who regarded me morosely from the\r\ndepths of the tent, \"I'm going out to bag a mammoth to-morrow, so\r\nkindly clean my elephant-gun and bring an axe to chop out the tusks.\"\r\n\r\nThat night Professor Smawl complained bitterly of the cooking, but as\r\nneither Dorothy nor I knew how to improve it, she revenged herself on\r\nus by eating everything on the table and retiring to bed, taking\r\nDorothy with her.\r\n\r\nI could not sleep very well; the mosquitoes were intrusive, and\r\nProfessor Smawl dreamed she was a pack of wolves and yelped in her\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\"Bird, ain't she?\" said William, roused from slumber by her weird\r\nnoises.\r\n\r\nDorothy, much frightened, crawled out of her tent, where her\r\nblanket-mate still dreamed dyspeptically, and William and I made her\r\ncomfortable by the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nIt takes a pretty girl to look pretty half asleep in a blanket.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you are quite well?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\nTo make sure, I tested her pulse. For an hour it varied more or less,\r\nbut without alarming either of us. Then she went back to bed and I sat\r\nalone by the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight I suddenly began to feel that strange, distant\r\nvibration that I had once before felt. As before, the vibration grew\r\non the still air, increasing in volume until it became a sound, then\r\ndied out into silence.\r\n\r\nI rose and stole into my tent.\r\n\r\nWilliam, white as death, lay in his corner, weeping in his sleep.\r\n\r\nI roused him remorselessly, and he sat up scowling, but refused to\r\ntell me what he had been dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"Was it about that third thing you saw--\" I began. But he snarled up\r\nat me like a startled animal, and I was obliged to go to bed and toss\r\nabout and speculate.\r\n\r\nThe next morning it rained. Dorothy and I visited our dingue-trap but\r\nfound nothing in it. We were inclined, however, to stay out in the\r\nrain behind a big tree, but Professor Smawl vetoed that proposition\r\nand sent me off to supply the larder with fresh meat.\r\n\r\nI returned, mad and wet, with a dozen partridges and a white\r\nhare--brown at that season--and William cooked them vilely.\r\n\r\n\"I can taste the feathers!\" said Professor Smawl, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"There is no accounting for taste,\" I said, with a polite gesture of\r\ndeprecation; \"personally, I find feathers unpalatable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may hand in your resignation this evening!\" cried Professor\r\nSmawl, in hollow tones of passion.\r\n\r\nI passed her the pancakes with a cheerful smile, and flippantly\r\npressed the hand next me. Unexpectedly it proved to be William's\r\nsticky fist, and Dorothy and I laughed until her tears ran into\r\nProfessor Smawl's coffee-cup--an accident which kindled her wrath to\r\nred heat, and she requested my resignation five times during the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe next day it rained again, more or less. Professor Smawl complained\r\nof the cooking, demanded my resignation, and finally marched out to\r\nexplore, lugging the reluctant William with her. Dorothy and I sat\r\ndown behind the largest tree we could find.\r\n\r\nI don't remember what we were saying when a peculiar sound interrupted\r\nus, and we listened earnestly.\r\n\r\nIt was like a bell in the woods, ding-dong! ding-dong! ding-dong!--a\r\nlow, mellow, golden harmony, coming nearer, then stopping.\r\n\r\nI clasped Dorothy in my arms in my excitement.\r\n\r\n\"It is the note of the dingue!\" I whispered, \"and that explains its\r\nname, handed down from remote ages along with the names of the\r\nbehemoth and the coney. It was because of its bell-like cry that it\r\nwas named! Darling!\" I cried, forgetting our short acquaintance, \"we\r\nhave made a discovery that the whole world will ring with!\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand we tiptoed through the forest to our trap. There was\r\nsomething in it that took fright at our approach and rushed\r\npanic-stricken round and round the interior of the trap, uttering its\r\nalarm-note, which sounded like the jangling of a whole string of\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nI seized the strangely beautiful creature; it neither attempted to\r\nbite nor scratch, but crouched in my arms, trembling and eying me.\r\n\r\nDelighted with the lovely, tame animal, we bore it tenderly back to\r\nthe camp and placed it on my blanket. Hand in hand we stood before it,\r\nawed by the sight of this beast, so long believed to be extinct.\r\n\r\n\"It is too good to be true,\" sighed Dorothy, clasping her white hands\r\nunder her chin and gazing at the dingue in rapture.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, solemnly, \"you and I, my child, are face to face with\r\nthe fabled dingue--_Dingus solitarius_! Let us continue to gaze at it,\r\nreverently, prayerfully, humbly--\"\r\n\r\nDorothy yawned--probably with excitement.\r\n\r\nWe were still mutely adoring the dingue when Professor Smawl burst\r\ninto the tent at a hand-gallop, bawling hoarsely for her kodak and\r\nnote-book.\r\n\r\nDorothy seized her triumphantly by the arm and pointed at the dingue,\r\nwhich appeared to be frightened to death.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Professor Smawl, scornfully; \"_that_ a dingue? Rubbish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" I said, firmly, \"it is a dingue! It's a monodactyl! See! It\r\nhas but a single toe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bosh!\" she retorted; \"it's got four!\"\r\n\r\n\"Four!\" I repeated, blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; one on each foot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I said; \"you didn't suppose a monodactyl meant a beast\r\nwith one leg and one toe!\"\r\n\r\nBut she laughed hatefully and declared it was a woodchuck.\r\n\r\nWe squabbled for a while until I saw the significance of her attitude.\r\nThe unfortunate woman wished to find a dingue first and be accredited\r\nwith the discovery.\r\n\r\nI lifted the dingue in both hands and shook the creature gently, until\r\nthe chiming ding-dong of its protestations filled our ears like sweet\r\nbells jangled out of tune.\r\n\r\nPale with rage at this final proof of the dingue's identity, she\r\nseized her camera and note-book.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any time to waste over that musical woodchuck!\" she\r\nshouted, and bounced out of the tent.\r\n\r\n\"What have you discovered, dear?\" cried Dorothy, running after her.\r\n\r\n\"A mammoth!\" bawled Professor Smawl, triumphantly; \"and I'm going to\r\nphotograph him!\"\r\n\r\nNeither Dorothy nor I believed her. We watched the flight of the\r\ninfatuated woman in silence.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, the tragic shadow falls over my paper as I write. I\r\nwas never passionately attached to Professor Smawl, yet I would gladly\r\nrefrain from chronicling the episode that must follow if, as I have\r\nhitherto attempted, I succeed in sticking to the unornamented truth.\r\n\r\nI have said that neither Dorothy nor I believed her. I don't know why,\r\nunless it was that we had not yet made up our minds to believe that\r\nthe mammoth still existed on earth. So, when Professor Smawl\r\ndisappeared in the forest, scuttling through the underbrush like a\r\ndemoralized hen, we viewed her flight with unconcern. There was a\r\nlarge tree in the neighborhood--a pleasant shelter in case of rain. So\r\nwe sat down behind it, although the sun was shining fiercely.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those peaceful afternoons in the wilderness when the\r\nwhole forest dreams, and the shadows are asleep and every little\r\nleaflet takes a nap. Under the still tree-tops the dappled sunlight,\r\nmotionless, soaked the sod; the forest-flies no longer whirled in\r\ncircles, but sat sunning their wings on slender twig-tips.\r\n\r\nThe heat was sweet and spicy; the sun drew out the delicate essence\r\nof gum and sap, warming volatile juices until they exhaled through the\r\naromatic bark.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down into the wilderness; the forest stirred in its\r\nsleep; a fish splashed in the lake. The spell was broken. Presently\r\nthe wind began to rise somewhere far away in the unknown land. I heard\r\nit coming, nearer, nearer--a brisk wind that grew heavier and blew\r\nharder as it neared us--a gale that swept distant branches--a furious\r\ngale that set limbs clashing and cracking, nearer and nearer. Crack!\r\nand the gale grew to a hurricane, trampling trees like dead twigs!\r\nCrack! Crackle! Crash! Crash!\r\n\r\n_Was it the wind?_\r\n\r\nWith the roaring in my ears I sprang up, staring into the forest\r\nvista, and at the same instant, out of the crashing forest, sped\r\nProfessor Smawl, skirts tucked up, thin legs flying like\r\nbicycle-spokes. I shouted, but the crashing drowned my voice. Then all\r\nat once the solid earth began to shake, and with the rush and roar of\r\na tornado a gigantic living thing burst out of the forest before our\r\neyes--a vast shadowy bulk that rocked and rolled along, mowing down\r\ntrees in its course.\r\n\r\nTwo great crescents of ivory curved from its head; its back swept\r\nthrough the tossing tree-tops. Once it bellowed like a gun fired from\r\na high bastion.\r\n\r\nThe apparition passed with the noise of thunder rolling on towards the\r\nends of the earth. Crack! crash! went the trees, the tempest swept\r\naway in a rolling volley of reports, distant, more distant, until,\r\nlong after the tumult had deadened, then ceased, the stunned forest\r\nechoed with the fall of mangled branches slowly dropping.\r\n\r\nThat evening an agitated young couple sat close together in the\r\ndeserted camp, calling timidly at intervals for Professor Smawl and\r\nWilliam Spike. I say timidly, because it is correct; we did not care\r\nto have a mammoth respond to our calls. The lurking echoes across the\r\nlake answered our cries; the full moon came up over the forest to look\r\nat us. We were not much to look at. Dorothy was moistening my shoulder\r\nwith unfeigned tears, and I, afraid to light the fire, sat hunched up\r\nunder the common blanket, wildly examining the darkness around us.\r\n\r\nChilled to the spinal marrow, I watched the gray lights whiten in the\r\neast. A single bird awoke in the wilderness. I saw the nearer trees\r\nlooming in the mist, and the silver fog rolling on the lake.\r\n\r\nAll night long the darkness had vibrated with the strange monotone\r\nwhich I had heard the first night, camping at the gate of the unknown\r\nland. My brain seemed to echo that subtle harmony which rings in the\r\nauricular labyrinth after sound has ceased.\r\n\r\nThere are ghosts of sound which return to haunt long after sound is\r\ndead. It was these voiceless spectres of a voice long dead that\r\nstirred the transparent silence, intoning toneless tones.\r\n\r\nI think I make myself clear.\r\n\r\nIt was an uncanny night; morning whitened the east; gray daylight\r\nstole into the woods, blotting the shadows to paler tints. It was\r\nnearly mid-day before the sun became visible through the fine-spun web\r\nof mist--a pale spot of gilt in the zenith.\r\n\r\nBy this pallid light I labored to strike the two empty tents, gather\r\nup our equipments and pack them on our five mules. Dorothy aided me\r\nbravely, whimpering when I spoke of Professor Smawl and William Spike,\r\nbut abating nothing of her industry until we had the mules loaded and\r\nI was ready to drive them, Heaven knows whither.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we go?\" quavered Dorothy, sitting on a log with the\r\ndingue in her lap.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain; this mammoth-ridden land was no place for\r\nwomen, and I told her so.\r\n\r\nWe placed the dingue in a basket and tied it around the leading mule's\r\nneck. Immediately the dingue, alarmed, began dingling like a cow-bell.\r\nIt acted like a charm on the other mules, and they gravely filed off\r\nafter their leader, following the bell. Dorothy and I, hand in hand,\r\nbrought up the rear.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that scene in the forest--the gray arch of the\r\nheavens swimming in mist through which the sun peered shiftily, the\r\ntall pines wavering through the fog, the preoccupied mules marching\r\nsingle file, the foggy bell-note of the gentle dingue in its swinging\r\nbasket, and Dorothy, limp kilts dripping with dew, plodding through\r\nthe white dusk.\r\n\r\nWe followed the terrible tornado-path which the mammoth had left in\r\nits wake, but there were no traces of its human victims--neither one\r\njot of Professor Smawl nor one solitary tittle of William Spike.\r\n\r\nAnd now I would be glad to end this chapter if I could; I would gladly\r\nleave myself as I was, there in the misty forest, with an arm\r\nencircling the slender body of my little companion, and the mules\r\nmoving in a monotonous line, and the dingue discreetly jingling--but\r\nagain that menacing shadow falls across my page, and truth bids me\r\ntell all, and I, the slave of accuracy, must remember my vows as the\r\ndauntless disciple of truth.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset--or that pale parody of sunset which set the forest\r\nswimming in a ghastly, colorless haze--the mammoth's trail of ruin\r\nbrought us suddenly out of the trees to the shore of a great sheet of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIt was a desolate spot; northward a chaos of sombre peaks rose, piled\r\nup like thunder-clouds along the horizon; east and south the darkening\r\nwilderness spread like a pall. Westward, crawling out into the mist\r\nfrom our very feet, the gray waste of water moved under the dull sky,\r\nand flat waves slapped the squatting rocks, heavy with slime.\r\n\r\nAnd now I understood why the trail of the mammoth continued straight\r\ninto the lake, for on either hand black, filthy tamarack swamps lay\r\nunder ghostly sheets of mist. I strove to creep out into the bog,\r\nseeking a footing, but the swamp quaked and the smooth surface\r\ntrembled like jelly in a bowl. A stick thrust into the slime sank into\r\nunknown depths.\r\n\r\nVaguely alarmed, I gained the firm land again and looked around,\r\nbelieving there was no road open but the desolate trail we had\r\ntraversed. But I was in error; already the leading mule was wading out\r\ninto the water, and the others, one by one, followed.\r\n\r\nHow wide the lake might be we could not tell, because the band of fog\r\nhung across the water like a curtain. Yet out into this flat, shallow\r\nvoid our mules went steadily, slop! slop! slop! in single file.\r\nAlready they were growing indistinct in the fog, so I bade Dorothy\r\nhasten and take off her shoes and stockings.\r\n\r\nShe was ready before I was, I having to unlace my shooting-boots, and\r\nshe stepped out into the water, kilts fluttering, moving her white\r\nfeet cautiously. In a moment I was beside her, and we waded forward,\r\nsounding the shallow water with our poles.\r\n\r\nWhen the water had risen to Dorothy's knees I hesitated, alarmed. But\r\nwhen we attempted to retrace our steps we could not find the shore\r\nagain, for the blank mist shrouded everything, and the water deepened\r\nat every step.\r\n\r\nI halted and listened for the mules. Far away in the fog I heard a\r\ndull splashing, receding as I listened. After a while all sound died\r\naway, and a slow horror stole over me--a horror that froze the little\r\nnet-work of veins in every limb. A step to the right and the water\r\nrose to my knees; a step to the left and the cold, thin circle of the\r\nflood chilled my breast. Suddenly Dorothy screamed, and the next\r\nmoment a far cry answered--a far, sweet cry that seemed to come from\r\nthe sky, like the rushing harmony of the world's swift winds. Then the\r\ncurtain of fog before us lighted up from behind; shadows moved on the\r\nmisty screen, outlines of trees and grassy shores, and tiny birds\r\nflying. Thrown on the vapory curtain, in silhouette, a man and a woman\r\npassed under the lovely trees, arms about each other's necks; near\r\nthem the shadows of five mules grazed peacefully; a dingue gambolled\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\n\"It is a mirage!\" I muttered, but my voice made no sound. Slowly the\r\nlight behind the fog died out; the vapor around us turned to rose,\r\nthen dissolved, while mile on mile of a limitless sea spread away\r\ntill, like a quick line pencilled at a stroke, the horizon cut sky and\r\nsea in half, and before us lay an ocean from which towered a mountain\r\nof snow--or a gigantic berg of milky ice--for it was moving.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens,\" I shrieked; \"it is alive!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my crazed cry the mountain of snow became a pillar,\r\ntowering to the clouds, and a wave of golden glory drenched the figure\r\nto its knees! Figure? Yes--for a colossal arm shot across the sky,\r\nthen curved back in exquisite grace to a head of awful beauty--a\r\nwoman's head, with eyes like the blue lake of heaven--ay, a woman's\r\nsplendid form, upright from the sky to the earth, knee-deep in the\r\nsea. The evening clouds drifted across her brow; her shimmering hair\r\nlighted the world beneath with sunset. Then, shading her white brow\r\nwith one hand, she bent, and with the other hand dipped in the sea,\r\nshe sent a wave rolling at us. Straight out of the horizon it sped--a\r\nripple that grew to a wave, then to a furious breaker which caught us\r\nup in a whirl of foam, bearing us onward, faster, faster, swiftly\r\nflying through leagues of spray until consciousness ceased and all was\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nYet ere my senses fled I heard again that strange cry--that sweet,\r\nthrilling harmony rushing out over the foaming waters, filling earth\r\nand sky with its soundless vibrations.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew it was the hail of the Spirit of the North warning us back\r\nto life again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back, now, over the days that passed before we staggered into\r\nthe Hudson Bay outpost at Gravel Cove, I am inclined to believe that\r\nneither Dorothy nor I were clothed entirely in our proper minds--or,\r\nif we were, our minds, no doubt, must have been in the same condition\r\nas our clothing. I remember shooting ptarmigan, and that we ate them;\r\nflashes of memory recall the steady downpour of rain through the\r\nendless twilight of shaggy forests; dim days on the foggy tundra,\r\nmud-holes from which the wild ducks rose in thousands; then the\r\nstunted hemlocks, then the forest again. And I do not even recall the\r\nmoment when, at last, stumbling into the smooth path left by the\r\nGraham Glacier, we crawled through the mountain-wall, out of the\r\nunknown land, and once more into a world protected by the Lord\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\nA hunting-party of Elbon Indians brought us in to the post, and\r\neverybody was most kind--that I remember, just before going into\r\nseveral weeks of unpleasant delirium mercifully mitigated with\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Professor Van Twiller was not very much battered,\r\nphysically, for I had carried her for days, pickaback. But the awful\r\nexperience had produced a shock which resulted in a nervous condition\r\nthat lasted so long after she returned to New York that the wealthy\r\nand eminent specialist who attended her insisted upon taking her to\r\nthe Riviera and marrying her. I sometimes wonder--but, as I have said,\r\nsuch reflections have no place in these austere pages.\r\n\r\nHowever, anybody, I fancy, is at liberty to speculate upon the fate of\r\nthe late Professor Smawl and William Spike, and upon the mules and the\r\ngentle dingue. Personally, I am convinced that the suggestive\r\nsilhouettes I saw on that ghastly curtain of fog were cast by\r\nbeatified beings in some earthly paradise--a mirage of bliss of which\r\nwe caught but the colorless shadow-shapes floating 'twixt sea and\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAt all events, neither Professor Smawl nor her William Spike ever\r\nreturned; no exploring expedition has found a trace of mule or lady,\r\nof William or the dingue. The new expedition to be organized by\r\nBarnard College may penetrate still farther. I suppose that, when the\r\ntime comes, I shall be expected to volunteer. But Professor Van\r\nTwiller is married, and William and Professor Smawl ought to be, and\r\naltogether, considering the mammoth and that gigantic and splendid\r\napparition that bent from the zenith to the ocean and sent a\r\ntidal-wave rolling from the palm of one white hand--I say, taking all\r\nthese various matters under consideration, I think I shall decide to\r\nremain in New York and continue writing for the scientific\r\nperiodicals. Besides, the mortifying experience at the Paris\r\nExposition has dampened even my perennially youthful enthusiasm. And\r\nas for the late expedition to Florida, Heaven knows I am ready to\r\nrepeat it--nay, I am already forming a plan for the rescue--but though\r\nI am prepared to encounter any danger for the sake of my beloved\r\nsuperior, Professor Farrago, I do not feel inclined to commit\r\nindiscretions in order to pry into secrets which, as I regard it,\r\nconcern Professor Smawl and William Spike alone.\r\n\r\nBut all this is, in a measure, premature. What I now have to relate is\r\nthe recital of an eye-witness to that most astonishing scandal which\r\noccurred during the recent exposition in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates were appointed to the International Scientific\r\nCongress at the Paris Exposition of 1900, how little did anybody\r\nimagine that the great conference would end in the most gigantic\r\nscandal that ever stirred two continents?\r\n\r\nYet, had it not been for the pair of American newspapers published in\r\nParis, this scandal would never have been aired, for the continental\r\npress is so well muzzled that when it bites its teeth merely meet in\r\nthe empty atmosphere with a discreet snap.\r\n\r\nBut to the Yankee nothing excepting the Monroe Doctrine is sacred, and\r\nthe unsopped watch-dogs of the press bite right and left, unmuzzled.\r\nThe biter bites--it is his profession--and that ends the affair; the\r\nbitee is bitten, and, in the deplorable argot of the hour, \"it is up\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\nSo now that the scandal has been well aired and hung out to dry in the\r\nteeth of decency and the four winds, and as all the details have been\r\ncheerfully and grossly exaggerated, it is, perhaps, the proper moment\r\nfor the truth to be written by the only person whose knowledge of all\r\nthe facts in the affair entitles him to speak for himself as well as\r\nfor those honorable ladies and gentlemen whose names and titles have\r\nbeen so mercilessly criticised.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the simple facts:\r\n\r\nThe International Scientific Congress, now adjourned _sine die_, met\r\nat nine o'clock in the morning, May 3, 1900, in the Tasmanian Pavilion\r\nof the Paris Exposition. There were present the most famous scientists\r\nof Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Crown-Prince of Monaco presided.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, now, to repeat the details of that preliminary\r\nmeeting. It is sufficient to say that committees representing the\r\nvarious known sciences were named and appointed by the Prince of\r\nMonaco, who had been unanimously elected permanent chairman of the\r\nconference. It is the composition of a single committee that concerns\r\nus now, and that committee, representing the science which treats of\r\nbird life, was made up as follows:\r\n\r\nChairman--His Royal Highness the Crown-Prince of Monaco. Members--Sir\r\nPeter Grebe, Great Britain; Baron de Becasse, France; his Royal\r\nHighness King Christian, of Finland; the Countess d'Alzette, of\r\nBelgium; and I, from the United States, representing the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution and the Bronx Park Zoological Society of New York.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the composition of that now notorious ornithological\r\ncommittee, a modest, earnest, self-effacing little band of workers,\r\nbound together--in the beginning--by those ties of mutual respect and\r\nesteem which unite all laborers in the vineyard of science.\r\n\r\nFrom the first meeting of our committee, science, the great leveller,\r\nleft no artificial barriers of rank or title standing between us. We\r\nwere enthusiasts in our love for ornithology; we found new inspiration\r\nin the democracy of our common interests.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I chatted with my fellows, feeling no restraint myself and\r\nperceiving none. The King of Finland and I discussed his latest\r\nmonograph on the speckled titmouse, and I was glad to agree with the\r\nKing in all his theories concerning the nesting habits of that\r\nimportant bird.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Grebe, a large, red gentleman in tweeds, read us some notes\r\nhe had made on the domestic hen and her reasons for running ahead of a\r\nhorse and wagon instead of stepping aside to let the disturbing\r\nvehicle pass.\r\n\r\nThe Crown-Prince of Monaco took issue with Sir Peter; so did the Baron\r\nde Becasse; and we were entertained by a friendly and marvellously\r\ninteresting three-cornered dispute, shared in by three of the most\r\nprofound thinkers of the century.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the brilliancy of that argument, nor the modest,\r\ngood-humored retorts which gave us all a glimpse into depths of\r\nerudition which impressed us profoundly and set the seal on the bonds\r\nwhich held us so closely together.\r\n\r\nAlas, that the seal should ever have been broken! Alas, that the\r\nglittering apple of discord should have been flung into our\r\nmidst!--no, not flung, but gently rolled under our noses by the gloved\r\nfingers of the lovely Countess d'Alzette.\r\n\r\n\"Messieurs,\" said the fair Countess, when all present, excepting she\r\nand I, had touched upon or indicated the subjects which they had\r\nprepared to present to the congress--\"messieurs mes confrères, I have\r\nbeen requested by our distinguished chairman, the Crown-Prince of\r\nMonaco, to submit to your judgment the subject which, by favor of the\r\nKing of the Belgians, I have prepared to present to the International\r\nScientific Congress.\"\r\n\r\nShe made a pretty courtesy as she named her own sovereign, and we all\r\nrose out of respect to that most austere and moral ruler the King of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she said, with a charming smile of depreciation, \"I am very,\r\nvery much afraid that the subject which I have chosen may not meet\r\nwith your approval, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood there in her dainty Parisian gown and bonnet, shaking her\r\npretty head uncertainly, a smile on her lips, her small, gloved\r\nfingers interlocked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know how dreadful it would be if this great congress should be\r\ncompelled to listen to any hoax like that which Monsieur de Rougemont\r\nimposed on the British Royal Society,\" she said, gravely; \"and because\r\nthe subject of my paper is as strange as the strangest phenomenon\r\nalleged to have been noted by Monsieur de Rougemont, I hesitate--\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the silent listeners around her. Sir Peter's red face\r\nhad hardened; the King of Finland frowned slightly; the Crown-Prince\r\nof Monaco and Baron de Becasse wore anxious smiles. But when her\r\nviolet eyes met mine I gave her a glance of encouragement, and that\r\nglance, I am forced to confess, was not dictated by scientific\r\napproval, but by something that never entirely dries up in the\r\nmustiest and dustiest of savants--the old Adam implanted in us all.\r\n\r\nNow, I knew perfectly well what her subject must be; so did every man\r\npresent. For it was no secret that his Majesty of Belgium had been\r\nswindled by some natives in Tasmania, and had paid a very large sum of\r\nmoney for a skin of that gigantic bird, the ux, which has been so\r\noften reported to exist among the inaccessible peaks of the Tasmanian\r\nMountains. Needless, perhaps, to say that the skin proved a fraud,\r\nbeing nothing more than a Barnum contrivance made up out of the skins\r\nof a dozen ostriches and cassowaries, and most cleverly put together\r\nby Chinese workmen; at least, such was the report made on it by Sir\r\nPeter Grebe, who had been sent by the British Society to Antwerp to\r\nexamine the acquisition. Needless, also, perhaps, to say that King\r\nLeopold, of Belgium, stoutly maintained that the skin of the ux was\r\ngenuine from beak to claw.\r\n\r\nFor six months there had been a most serious difference of opinion\r\namong European ornithologists concerning the famous ux in the Antwerp\r\nMuseum; and this difference had promised to result in an open quarrel\r\nbetween a few Belgian savants on one side and-all Europe and Great\r\nBritain on the other.\r\n\r\nScientists have a deep--rooted horror of anything that touches on\r\ncharlatanism; the taint of trickery not only alarms them, but drives\r\nthem away from any suspicious subject, and usually ruins,\r\nscientifically speaking, the person who has introduced the subject for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it took no little courage for the Countess d'Alzette to\r\ntouch, with her dainty gloves, a subject which every scientist in\r\nEurope, with scarcely an exception, had pronounced fraudulent and\r\nunworthy of investigation. And to bring it before the great\r\nInternational Congress required more courage still; for the person\r\nwho could face, in executive session, the most brilliant intellects in\r\nthe world, and openly profess faith in a Barnumized bird skin, either\r\nhad no scientific reputation to lose or was possessed of a bravery far\r\nabove that of the savants who composed the audience.\r\n\r\nNow, when the pretty Countess caught a flash of encouragement in my\r\nglance she turned rosy with gratification and surprise. Clearly, she\r\nhad not expected to find a single ally in the entire congress. Her\r\nquick smile of gratitude touched me, and made me ashamed, too, for I\r\nhad encouraged her out of the pure love of mischief, hoping to hear\r\nthe whole matter threshed before the congress and so have it settled\r\nonce for all. It was a thoughtless thing to do on my part. I should\r\nhave remembered the consequences to the Countess if it were proven\r\nthat she had been championing a fraud. The ruffled dignity of the\r\ncongress would never forgive her; her scientific career would\r\npractically be at an end, because her theories and observations could\r\nno longer command respect or even the attention of those who knew that\r\nshe herself had once been deceived by a palpable fraud.\r\n\r\nI looked at her guiltily, already ashamed of myself for encouraging\r\nher to her destruction. How lovely and innocent she appeared, standing\r\nthere reading her notes in a low, clear voice, fresh as a child's,\r\nwith now and then a delicious upward sweep of her long, dark lashes.\r\n\r\nWith a start I came to my senses and bestowed a pinch on myself. This\r\nwas neither the time nor the place to sentimentalize over a girlish\r\nbeauty whose small, Parisian head was crammed full of foolish, brave\r\ntheories concerning an imposition which her aged sovereign had been\r\nunable to detect.\r\n\r\nI saw the gathering frown on the King of Finland's dark face; I saw\r\nSir Peter Grebe grow redder and redder, and press his thick lips\r\ntogether to control the angry \"Bosh!\" which need not have been uttered\r\nto have been understood. The Baron de Becasse wore a painfully neutral\r\nsmile, which froze his face into a quaint gargoyle; the Crown-Prince\r\nof Monaco looked at his polished fingernails with a startled yet\r\nabstracted resignation. Clearly the young Countess had not a\r\nsympathizer in the committee.\r\n\r\nSomething--perhaps it was the latent chivalry which exists imbedded in\r\nus all, perhaps it was pity, perhaps a glimmering dawn of belief in\r\nthe ux skin--set my thoughts working very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe Countess d'Alzette finished her notes, then glanced around with a\r\ndeprecating smile, which died out on her lips when she perceived the\r\nsilent and stony hostility of her fellow-scientists. A quick\r\nexpression of alarm came into her lovely eyes. Would they vote against\r\ngiving her a hearing before the congress? It required a unanimous vote\r\nto reject a subject. She turned her eyes on me.\r\n\r\nI rose, red as fire, my head humming with a chaos of ideas all\r\ndisordered and vague, yet whirling along in a single, resistless\r\ncurrent. I had come to the congress prepared to deliver a monograph on\r\nthe great auk; but now the subject went overboard as the birds\r\nthemselves had, and I found myself pleading with the committee to give\r\nthe Countess a hearing on the ux.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I exclaimed, warmly. \"It is established beyond question\r\nthat the ux does exist in Tasmania. Wallace saw several uxen, through\r\nhis telescope, walking about upon the inaccessible heights of the\r\nTasmanian Mountains. Darwin acknowledged that the bird exists;\r\nProfessor Farrago has published a pamphlet containing an accumulation\r\nof all data bearing upon the ux. Why should not Madame la Comtesse be\r\nheard by the entire congress?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at Sir Peter Grebe.\r\n\r\n\"Have _you_ seen this alleged bird skin in the Antwerp Museum?\" he\r\nasked, perspiring with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have,\" said I. \"It has been patched up, but how are we to know\r\nthat the skin did not require patching? I have not found that ostrich\r\nskin has been used. It is true that the Tasmanians may have shot the\r\nbird to pieces and mended the skin with bits of cassowary hide here\r\nand there. But the greater part of the skin, and the beak and claws,\r\nare, in my estimation, well worth the serious attention of savants. To\r\npronounce them fraudulent is, in my opinion, rash and premature.\"\r\n\r\nI mopped my brow; I was in for it now. I had thrown in my reputation\r\nwith the reputation of the Countess.\r\n\r\nThe displeasure and astonishment of my confrères was unmistakable. In\r\nthe midst of a strained silence I moved that a vote be taken upon the\r\nadvisability of a hearing before the congress on the subject of the\r\nux. After a pause the young Countess, pale and determined, seconded my\r\nmotion. The result of the balloting was a foregone conclusion; the\r\nCountess had one vote--she herself refraining from voting--and the\r\nsubject was entered on the committee-book as acceptable and a date set\r\nfor the hearing before the International Congress.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this vote on our little committee was most marked.\r\nConstraint took the place of cordiality, polite reserve replaced that\r\nguileless and open-hearted courtesy with which our proceedings had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWith icy politeness, the Crown-Prince of Monaco asked me to state the\r\nsubject of the paper I proposed to read before the congress, and I\r\nreplied quietly that, as I was partly responsible for advocating the\r\ndiscussion of the ux, I proposed to associate myself with the Countess\r\nd'Alzette in that matter--if Madame la Comtesse would accept the offer\r\nof a brother savant.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I will,\" she said, impulsively, her blue eyes soft with\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" observed Sir Peter Grebe, swallowing his indignation and\r\nwaddling off towards the door; \"I shall resign my position on this\r\ncommittee--yes, I will, I tell you!\"--as the King of Finland laid a\r\nfatherly hand on Sir Peter's sleeve--\"I'll not be made responsible for\r\nthis damn--\"\r\n\r\nHe choked, sputtered, then bowed to the horrified Countess, asking\r\npardon, and declaring that he yielded to nobody in respect for the\r\ngentler sex. And he retired with the Baron de Becasse.\r\n\r\nBut out in the hallway I heard him explode. \"Confound it! This is no\r\nplace for petticoats, Baron! And as for that Yankee ornithologist,\r\nhe's hung himself with the Countess's corset--string--yes, he has!\r\nDon't tell me, Baron! The young idiot was all right until the Countess\r\nlooked at him, I tell you. Gad! how she crumpled him up with those\r\nblue eyes of hers! What the devil do women come into such committees\r\nfor? Eh? It's an outrage, I tell you! Why, the whole world will jeer\r\nat us if we sit and listen to her monograph on that fraudulent bird!\"\r\n\r\nThe young Countess, who was writing near the window, could not have\r\nheard this outburst; but I heard it, and so did King Christian and the\r\nCrown-Prince of Monaco.\r\n\r\n\"Lord,\" thought I, \"the Countess and I are in the frying-pan this\r\ntime. I'll do what I can to keep us both out of the fire.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the King and the Crown-Prince had made their adieux to the\r\nCountess, and she had responded, pale and serious, they came over to\r\nwhere I was standing, looking out on the Seine.\r\n\r\n\"Though we must differ from you,\" said the King, kindly, \"we wish you\r\nall success in this dangerous undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him.\r\n\r\n\"You are a young man to risk a reputation already established,\"\r\nremarked the Crown-Prince, then added: \"You are braver than I.\r\nRidicule is a barrier to all knowledge, and, though we know that, we\r\nseekers after truth always bring up short at that barrier and\r\ndismount, not daring to put our hobbies to the fence.\"\r\n\r\n\"One can but come a cropper,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And risk staking our hobbies? No, no, that would make us ridiculous;\r\nand ridicule kills in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's somewhat deadly in America, too,\" I said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"The more honor to you,\" said the Crown-Prince, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not the only one,\" I answered, lightly. \"There is my\r\nconfrère, Professor Hyssop, who studies apparitions and braves a\r\ncontempt and ridicule which none of us would dare challenge. We\r\nYankees are learning slowly. Some day we will find the lost key to the\r\nfuture while Europe is sneering at those who are trying to pick the\r\nlock.\"\r\n\r\nWhen King Christian, of Finland, and the Crown-Prince of Monaco had\r\ntaken their hats and sticks and departed, I glanced across the room at\r\nthe young Countess, who was now working rapidly on a type-writer,\r\napparently quite oblivious of my presence.\r\n\r\nI looked out of the window again, and my gaze wandered over the\r\nexposition grounds. Gilt and scarlet and azure the palaces rose in\r\nevery direction, under a wilderness of fluttering flags. Towers,\r\nminarets, turrets, golden spires cut the blue sky; in the west the\r\ngaunt Eiffel Tower sprawled across the glittering Esplanade; behind it\r\nrose the solid golden dome of the Emperor's tomb, gilded once more by\r\nthe Almighty's sun, to amuse the living rabble while the dead\r\nslumbered in his imperial crypt, himself now but a relic for the\r\namusement of the people whom he had despised. O tempora! O mores! O\r\nNapoleon!\r\n\r\nDown under my window, in the asphalted court, the King of Finland was\r\nentering his beautiful victoria. An adjutant, wearing a cocked hat and\r\nbrilliant uniform, mounted the box beside the green-and-gold coachman;\r\nthe two postilions straightened up in their saddles; the four horses\r\ndanced. Then, when the Crown-Prince of Monaco had taken a seat beside\r\nthe King, the carriage rolled away, and far down the quay I watched it\r\nuntil the flutter of the green-and-white plumes in the adjutant's\r\ncocked hat was all I could see of vanishing royalty.\r\n\r\nI was still musing there by the window, listening to the click and\r\nringing of the type-writer, when I suddenly became aware that the\r\nclicking had ceased, and, turning, I saw the young Countess standing\r\nbeside me.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your chivalrous impulse to help me,\" she said, frankly,\r\nholding out her bare hand.\r\n\r\nI bent over it.\r\n\r\n\"I had not realized how desperate my case was,\" she said, with a\r\nsmile. \"I supposed that they would at least give me a hearing. How can\r\nI thank you for your brave vote in my favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"By giving me your confidence in this matter,\" said I, gravely. \"If we\r\nare to win, we must work together and work hard, madame. We are\r\nentering a struggle, not only to prove the genuineness of a bird skin\r\nand the existence of a bird which neither of us has ever seen, but\r\nalso a struggle which will either make us famous forever or render it\r\nimpossible for either of us ever again to face a scientific audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" she said, quietly \"And I understand all the better how\r\ngallant a gentleman I have had the fortune to enlist in my cause.\r\nBelieve me, had I not absolute confidence in my ability to prove the\r\nexistence of the ux I should not, selfish as I am, have accepted your\r\nchivalrous offer to stand or fall with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe subtle emotion in her voice touched a responsive chord in me. I\r\nlooked at her earnestly; she raised her beautiful eyes to mine.\r\n\r\n\"Will you help me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nWould I help her? Faith, I'd pass the balance of my life turning\r\nflip-flaps to please her. I did not attempt to undeceive myself; I\r\nrealized that the lightning had struck me--that I was desperately in\r\nlove with the young Countess from the tip of her bonnet to the toe of\r\nher small, polished shoe. I was curiously cool about it, too, although\r\nmy heart gave a thump that nigh choked me, and I felt myself going red\r\nfrom temple to chin.\r\n\r\nIf the Countess d'Alzette noticed it she gave no sign, unless the pink\r\ntint under her eyes, deepening, was a subtle signal of understanding\r\nto the signal in my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" she said, \"that I failed, before the congress, to prove my\r\ntheory? Suppose my investigations resulted in the exposure of a fraud\r\nand my name was held up to ridicule before all Europe? What would\r\nbecome of you, monsieur?\"\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n\"You are already celebrated as the discoverer of the mammoth and the\r\ngreat auk,\" she persisted. \"You are young, enthusiastic, renowned, and\r\nyou have a future before you that anybody in the world might envy.\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" she said, softly, \"you risk all because you will not leave\r\na young woman friendless among her confrères. It is not wise,\r\nmonsieur; it is gallant and generous and impulsive, but it is not\r\nwisdom. Don Quixote rides no more in Europe, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"He stays at home--seventy million of him--in America,\" said I.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment she said, \"I believe you, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true enough,\" I said, with a laugh. \"We are the only people who\r\ntilt at windmills these days--we and our cousins, the British, who\r\ntaught us.\"\r\n\r\nI bowed gayly, and added:\r\n\r\n\"With your colors to wear, I shall have the honor of breaking a lance\r\nagainst the biggest windmill in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Citadel of Science,\" she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"And its rock-ribbed respectability,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me thoughtfully, rolling and unrolling the scroll in her\r\nhands. Then she sighed, smiled, and brightened, handing me the scroll.\r\n\r\n\"Read it carefully,\" she said; \"it is an outline of the policy I\r\nsuggest that we follow. You will be surprised at some of the\r\nstatements. Yet every word is the truth. And, monsieur, your reward\r\nfor the devotion you have offered will be no greater than you deserve,\r\nwhen you find yourself doubly famous for our joint monograph on the\r\nux. Without your vote in the committee I should have been denied a\r\nhearing, even though I produced proofs to support my theory. I\r\nappreciate that; I do most truly appreciate the courage which prompted\r\nyou to defend a woman at the risk of your own ruin. Come to me this\r\nevening at nine. I hold for you in store a surprise and pleasure which\r\nyou do not dream of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but I do,\" I said, slowly, under the spell of her delicate beauty\r\nand enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"How can you?\" she said, laughing. \"You don't know what awaits you at\r\nnine this evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"You,\" I said, fascinated.\r\n\r\nThe color swept her face; she dropped me a deep courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"At nine, then,\" she said. \"No. 8 Rue d'Alouette.\"\r\n\r\nI bowed, took my hat, gloves, and stick, and attended her to her\r\ncarriage below.\r\n\r\nLong after the blue-and-black victoria had whirled away down the\r\ncrowded quay I stood looking after it, mazed in the web of that\r\nancient enchantment whose spell fell over the first man in Eden, and\r\nwhose sorcery shall not fail till the last man returns his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nI lunched at my lodgings on the Quai Malthus, and I had but little\r\nappetite, having fed upon such an unexpected variety of emotions\r\nduring the morning.\r\n\r\nNow, although I was already heels over head in love, I do not believe\r\nthat loss of appetite was the result of that alone. I was slowly\r\nbeginning to realize what my recent attitude might cost me, not only\r\nin an utter collapse of my scientific career, and the consequent\r\nmaterial ruin which was likely to follow, but in the loss of all my\r\nfriends at home. The Zoological Society of Bronx Park and the\r\nSmithsonian Institution of Washington had sent me as their trusted\r\ndelegate, leaving it entirely to me to choose the subject on which I\r\nwas to speak before the International Congress. What, then, would be\r\ntheir attitude when they learned that I had chosen to uphold the\r\ndangerous theory of the existence of the ux.\r\n\r\nWould they repudiate me and send another delegate to replace me? Would\r\nthey merely wash their hands of me and let me go to my own\r\ndestruction?\r\n\r\n\"I will know soon enough,\" thought I, \"for this morning's proceedings\r\nwill have been cabled to New York ere now, and read at the\r\nbreakfast-tables of every old, moss-grown naturalist in America before\r\nI see the Countess d'Alzette this evening.\" And I drew from my pocket\r\nthe roll of paper which she had given me, and, lighting a cigar, lay\r\nback in my chair to read it.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript had been beautifully type-written, and I had no trouble\r\nin following her brief, clear account of the circumstances under which\r\nthe notorious ux-skin had been obtained. As for the story itself, it\r\nwas somewhat fishy, but I manfully swallowed my growing nervousness\r\nand comforted myself with the belief of Darwin in the existence of the\r\nux, and the subsequent testimony of Wallace, who simply stated what he\r\nhad seen through his telescope, and then left it to others to identify\r\nthe enormous birds he described as he had observed them stalking about\r\non the snowy peaks of the Tasmanian Alps.\r\n\r\nMy own knowledge of the ux was confined to a single circumstance.\r\nWhen, in 1897, I had gone to Tasmania with Professor Farrago, to make\r\na report on the availability of the so-called \"Tasmanian devil,\" as a\r\nsubstitute for the mongoose in the West Indies, I of course heard a\r\ngreat deal of talk among the natives concerning the birds which they\r\naffirmed haunted the summits of the mountains.\r\n\r\nOur time in Tasmania was too limited to admit of an exploration then.\r\nBut although we were perfectly aware that the summits of the Tasmanian\r\nAlps are inaccessible, we certainly should have attempted to gain them\r\nhad not the time set for our departure arrived before we had completed\r\nthe investigation for which we were sent.\r\n\r\nOne relic, however, I carried away with me. It was a single greenish\r\nbronzed feather, found high up in the mountains by a native, and sold\r\nto me for a somewhat large sum of money.\r\n\r\nDarwin believed the ux to be covered with greenish plumage; Wallace\r\nwas too far away to observe the color of the great birds; but all the\r\nnatives of Tasmania unite in affirming that the plumage of the ux is\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the color of this feather that made me an eager\r\npurchaser, it was the extraordinary length and size. I knew of no\r\nliving bird large enough to wear such a feather. As for the color,\r\nthat might have been tampered with before I bought it, and, indeed,\r\ntesting it later, I found on the fronds traces of sulphate of copper.\r\nBut the same thing has been found in the feathers of certain birds\r\nwhose color is metallic green, and it has been proven that such birds\r\npick up and swallow shining bits of copper pyrites.\r\n\r\nWhy should not the ux do the same thing?\r\n\r\nStill, my only reason for believing in the existence of the bird was\r\nthis single feather. I had easily proved that it belonged to no known\r\nspecies of bird. I also proved it to be similar to the tail-feathers\r\nof the ux-skin in Antwerp. But the feathers on the Antwerp specimen\r\nwere gray, and the longest of them was but three feet in length, while\r\nmy huge, bronze-green feather measured eleven feet from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nOne might account for it supposing the Antwerp skin to be that of a\r\nyoung bird, or of a moulting bird, or perhaps of a different sex from\r\nthe bird whose feather I had secured.\r\n\r\nStill, these ideas were not proven. Nothing concerning the birds had\r\nbeen proven. I had but a single fact to lean on, and that was that the\r\nfeather I possessed could not have belonged to any known species of\r\nbird. Nobody but myself knew of the existence of this feather. And now\r\nI meant to cable to Bronx Park for it, and to place this evidence at\r\nthe disposal of the beautiful Countess d'Alzette.\r\n\r\nMy cigar had gone out, as I sat musing, and I relighted it and resumed\r\nmy reading of the type-written notes, lazily, even a trifle\r\nsceptically, for all the evidence that she had been able to collect to\r\nsubstantiate her theory of the existence of the ux was not half as\r\nimportant as the evidence I was to produce in the shape of that\r\nenormous green feather.\r\n\r\nI came to the last paragraph, smoking serenely, and leaning back\r\ncomfortably, one leg crossed over the other. Then, suddenly, my\r\nattention became riveted on the words under my eyes. Could I have read\r\nthem aright? Could I believe what I read in ever-growing astonishment\r\nwhich culminated in an excitement that stirred the very hair on my\r\nhead?\r\n\r\n    \"The ux exists. There is no longer room for doubt. Ocular\r\n    proof I can now offer in the shape of _five living eggs_ of\r\n    this gigantic bird. All measures have been taken to hatch\r\n    these eggs; they are now in the vast incubator. It is my plan\r\n    to have them hatch, one by one, under the very eyes of the\r\n    International Congress. It will be the greatest triumph that\r\n    science has witnessed since the discovery of the New World.\r\n\r\n          [Signed] \"SUSANNE D'ALZETTE.\"\r\n\r\n\"Either,\" I cried out, in uncontrollable excitement--\"either that girl\r\nis mad or she is the cleverest woman on earth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment I added:\r\n\r\n\"In either event I am going to marry her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, a few minutes before nine o'clock, I descended from a\r\ncab in front of No. 8 Rue d'Alouette, and was ushered into a pretty\r\nreception-room by an irreproachable servant, who disappeared directly\r\nwith my card.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the young Countess came in, exquisite in her silvery\r\ndinner-gown, eyes bright, white arms extended in a charming, impulsive\r\nwelcome. The touch of her silky fingers thrilled me; I was dumb under\r\nthe enchantment of her beauty; and I think she understood my silence,\r\nfor her blue eyes became troubled and the happy parting of her lips\r\nchanged to a pensive curve.\r\n\r\nPresently I began to tell her about my bronzed-green feather; at my\r\nfirst word she looked up brightly, almost gratefully, I fancied; and\r\nin another moment we were deep in eager discussion of the subject\r\nwhich had first drawn us together.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence I possessed to sustain our theory concerning the\r\nexistence of the ux I hastened to reveal; then, heart beating\r\nexcitedly, I asked her about the eggs and where they were at present,\r\nand whether she believed it possible to bring them to Paris--all these\r\nquestions in the same breath--which brought a happy light into her\r\neyes and a delicious ripple of laughter to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course it is possible to bring the eggs here,\" she cried. \"Am\r\nI sure? Parbleu! The eggs are already here, monsieur!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" I exclaimed. \"In Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Paris? Mais oui; and in my own house--_this very house_, monsieur.\r\nCome, you shall behold them with your own eyes!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were brilliant with excitement; impulsively she stretched out\r\nher rosy hand. I took it; and she led me quickly back through the\r\ndrawing-room, through the dining-room, across the butler's pantry, and\r\ninto a long, dark hallway. We were almost running now--I keeping tight\r\nhold of her soft little hand, she, raising her gown a trifle, hurrying\r\ndown the hallway, silken petticoats rustling like a silk banner in the\r\nwind. A turn to the right brought us to the cellar-stairs; down we\r\nhastened, and then across the cemented floor towards a long,\r\nglass-fronted shelf, pierced with steam-pipes.\r\n\r\n\"A match,\" she whispered, breathlessly.\r\n\r\nI struck a wax match and touched it to the gas-burner overhead.\r\n\r\nNever, never can I forget what that flood of gas-light revealed. In a\r\nrow stood five large, glass-mounted incubators; behind the glass doors\r\nlay, in dormant majesty, five enormous eggs. The eggs were\r\npale-green--lighter, somewhat, than robins' eggs, but not as pale as\r\nherons' eggs. Each egg appeared to be larger than a large hogs-head,\r\nand was partly embedded in bales of cotton-wool.\r\n\r\nFive little silver thermometers inside the glass doors indicated a\r\ntemperature of 95° Fahrenheit. I noticed that there was an automatic\r\narrangement connected with the pipes which regulated the temperature.\r\n\r\nI was too deeply moved for words. Speech seemed superfluous as we\r\nstood there, hand in hand, contemplating those gigantic, pale-green\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThere is something in a silent egg which moves one's deeper\r\nemotions--something solemn in its embryotic inertia, something awesome\r\nin its featureless immobility.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing on earth which is so totally lacking in expression\r\nas an egg. The great desert Sphinx, brooding through its veil of sand,\r\nhas not that tremendous and meaningless dignity which wraps the\r\ncolorless oval effort of a single domestic hen.\r\n\r\nI held the hand of the young Countess very tightly. Her fingers closed\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nThen and there, in the solemn presence of those emotionless eggs, I\r\nplaced my arm around her supple waist and kissed her.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing. Presently she stooped to observe the thermometer.\r\nNaturally, it registered 95° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\"Susanne,\" I said, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we must go up-stairs,\" she whispered, breathlessly; and, picking\r\nup her silken skirts, she fled up the cellar-stairs.\r\n\r\nI turned out the gas, with that instinct of economy which early\r\nwastefulness has implanted in me, and followed the Countess Suzanne\r\nthrough the suite of rooms and into the small reception-hall where she\r\nhad first received me.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on a low divan, head bent, slowly turning a sapphire\r\nring on her finger, round and round.\r\n\r\nI looked at her romantically, and then--\r\n\r\n\"Please don't,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe correct reply to this is:\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"--very tenderly spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" she replied, which was also the correct and regular answer.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" I said, slowly and passionately.\r\n\r\nShe turned the sapphire ring on her finger. Presently she tired of\r\nthis, so I lifted her passive hand very gently and continued turning\r\nthe sapphire ring on her finger, slowly, to harmonize with the cadence\r\nof our unspoken thoughts.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight I went home, walking with great care through a new\r\nstreet in Paris, paved exclusively with rose-colored blocks of air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the evening, July 31, 1900, the International\r\nCongress was to assemble in the great lecture-hall of the Belgian\r\nScientific Pavilion, which adjourned the Tasmanian Pavilion, to hear\r\nthe Countess Suzanne d'Alzette read her paper on the ux.\r\n\r\nThat morning the Countess and I, with five furniture vans, had\r\ntransported the five great incubators to the platform of the\r\nlecture-hall, and had engaged an army of plumbers and gas-fitters to\r\nmake the steam-heating connections necessary to maintain in the\r\nincubators a temperature of 100° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nA heavy green curtain hid the stage from the body of the lecture-hall.\r\nBehind this curtain the five enormous eggs reposed, each in its\r\nincubator.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Suzanne was excited and calm by turns, her cheeks were\r\npink, her lips scarlet, her eyes bright as blue planets at midnight.\r\n\r\nWithout faltering she rehearsed her discourse before me, reading from\r\nher type-written manuscript in a clear voice, in which I could\r\nscarcely discern a tremor. Then we went through the dumb show of\r\nexhibiting the uxen eggs to a frantically applauding audience; she\r\nresponded to countless supposititious encores, I leading her out\r\nrepeatedly before the green curtain to face the great, damp, darkened\r\nauditorium.\r\n\r\nThen, in response to repeated imaginary recalls, she rehearsed the\r\nextemporaneous speech, thanking the distinguished audience for their\r\npatience in listening to an unknown confrère, and confessing her\r\nobligations to me (here I appeared and bowed in self-abasement) for my\r\nfaith in her and my aid in securing for her a public hearing before\r\nthe most highly educated audience in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter that we retired behind the curtain to sit on an empty box and\r\neat sandwiches and watch the last lingering plumbers pasting up the\r\nsteam connections with a pot of molten lead.\r\n\r\nThe plumbers were Americans, brought to Paris to make repairs on the\r\nAmerican buildings during the exposition, and we conversed with them\r\naffably as they pottered about, plumber-like, poking under the\r\nflooring with lighted candles, rubbing their thumbs up and down musty\r\nold pipes, and prying up planks in dark corners.\r\n\r\nThey informed us that they were union men and that they hoped we were\r\ntoo. And I replied that union was certainly my ultimate purpose, at\r\nwhich the young Countess smiled dreamily at vacancy.\r\n\r\nWe did not dare leave the incubators. The plumbers lingered on, hour\r\nafter hour, while we sat and watched the little silver thermometers,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nIt was time for the Countess Suzanne to dress, and still the plumbers\r\nhad not finished; so I sent a messenger for her maid, to bring her\r\ntrunk to the lecture-hall, and I despatched another messenger to my\r\nlodgings for my evening clothes and fresh linen.\r\n\r\nThere were several dressing-rooms off the stage. Here, about six\r\no'clock, the Countess retired with her maid, to dress, leaving me to\r\nwatch the plumbers and the thermometers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Countess Suzanne returned, radiant and lovely in an evening\r\ngown of black lace, I gave her the roses I had brought for her and\r\nhurried off to dress in my turn, leaving her to watch the\r\nthermometers.\r\n\r\nI was not absent more than half an hour, but when I returned I found\r\nthe Countess anxiously conversing with the plumbers and pointing\r\ndespairingly at the thermometers, which now registered only 95°.\r\n\r\n\"You must keep up the temperature!\" I said. \"Those eggs are due to\r\nhatch within a few hours. What's the trouble with the heat?\"\r\n\r\nThe plumber did not know, but thought the connections were defective.\r\n\r\n\"But that's why we called you in!\" exclaimed the Countess. \"Can't you\r\nfix things securely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll fix things, lady,\" replied the plumber, condescendingly,\r\nand he ambled away to rub his thumb up and down a pipe.\r\n\r\nAs we alone were unable to move and handle the enormous eggs, the\r\nCountess, whose sweet character was a stranger to vindictiveness or\r\npetty resentment, had written to the members of the ornithological\r\ncommittee, revealing the marvellous fortune which had crowned her\r\nefforts in the search for evidence to sustain her theory concerning\r\nthe ux, and inviting these gentlemen to aid her in displaying the\r\ngreat eggs to the assembled congress.\r\n\r\nThis she had done the night previous. Every one of the gentlemen\r\ninvited had come post-haste to her \"hotel,\" to view the eggs with\r\ntheir own sceptical and astonished eyes; and the fair young Countess\r\nand I tasted our first triumph in her cellar, whither we conducted Sir\r\nPeter Grebe, the Crown-Prince of Monaco, Baron de Becasse, and his\r\nMajesty King Christian of Finland.\r\n\r\nScepticism and incredulity gave place to excitement and unbounded\r\nenthusiasm. The old King embraced the Countess; Baron de Becasse\r\nattempted to kiss me; Sir Peter Grebe made a handsome apology for his\r\nfolly and vowed that he would do open penance for his sins. The poor\r\nCrown-Prince, who was of a nervous temperament, sat on the\r\ncellar-stairs and wept like a child.\r\n\r\nHis grief at his own pig-headedness touched us all profoundly.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that these gentlemen were coming to-night to give their\r\naid to us in moving the priceless eggs, and lend their countenance and\r\nenthusiastic support to the young Countess in her maiden effort.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Grebe arrived first, all covered with orders and\r\ndecorations, and greeted us affectionately, calling the Countess the\r\n\"sweetest lass in France,\" and me his undutiful Yankee cousin who had\r\nlanded feet foremost at the expense of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe King of Finland, the Crown-Prince, and Baron de Becasse arrived\r\ntogether, a composite mass of medals, sashes, and academy palms. To\r\nsee them moving boxes about, straightening chairs, and pulling out\r\nrugs reminded me of those golden-embroidered gentlemen who run out\r\ninto the arena and roll up carpets after the acrobats have finished\r\ntheir turn in the Nouveau Cirque.\r\n\r\nI was aiding the King of Finland to move a heavy keg of nails, when\r\nthe Countess called out to me in alarm, saying that the thermometers\r\nhad dropped to 80° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nI spoke sharply to the plumbers, who were standing in a circle behind\r\nthe dressing-rooms; but they answered sullenly that they could do no\r\nmore work that day.\r\n\r\nIndignant and alarmed, I ordered them to come out to the stage, and,\r\nafter some hesitation, they filed out, a sulky, silent lot of workmen,\r\nwith their tools already gathered up and tied in their kits. At once I\r\nnoticed that a new man had appeared among them--a red-faced, stocky\r\nman wearing a frock-coat and a shiny silk hat.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the master-workman here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" said a man in blue overalls.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"why don't you fix those steam-fittings?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The man in the silk hat smirked.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, that's all right,\" said the man in the silk hat. \"These\r\nmen know their business without you tellin' them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm just a walkin' delegate,\" he replied, with a sneer. \"There's\r\na strike in New York and I come over here to tie this here exposition\r\nup. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say you won't let these men finish their work?\" I asked,\r\nthunderstruck.\r\n\r\n\"That's about it, young man,\" he said, coolly.\r\n\r\nFurious, I glanced at my watch, then at the thermometers, which now\r\nregistered only 75°. Already I could hear the first-comers of the\r\naudience arriving in the body of the hall. Already a stage-hand was\r\nturning up the footlights and dragging chairs and tables hither and\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n\"What will you take to stay and attend to those steam-pipes?\" I\r\ndemanded, desperately.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done nohow,\" observed the man in the silk hat. \"That New\r\nYork strike is good for a month yet.\" Then, turning to the workmen, he\r\nnodded and, to my horror, the whole gang filed out after him, turning\r\ndeaf ears to my entreaties and threats.\r\n\r\nThere was a deathly silence, then Sir Peter exploded into a vivid\r\nshower of words. The Countess, pale as a ghost, gave me a\r\nheart-breaking look. The Crown-Prince wept.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heaven!\" I cried; \"the thermometers have fallen to 70°!\"\r\n\r\nThe King of Finland sat down on a chair and pressed his hands over his\r\neyes. Baron de Becasse ran round and round, uttering subdued and\r\nplaintive screams; Sir Peter swore steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I cried, desperately, \"we must save those eggs! They are\r\non the very eve of hatching! Who will volunteer?\"\r\n\r\n\"To do what?\" moaned the Crown-Prince.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you,\" I exclaimed, running to the incubators and beckoning\r\nto the Baron to aid me.\r\n\r\nIn a moment we had rolled out the great egg, made a nest on the stage\r\nfloor with the bales of cotton-wool, and placed the egg in it. One\r\nafter another we rolled out the remaining eggs, building for each its\r\nnest of cotton; and at last the five enormous eggs lay there in a row\r\nbehind the green curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, excitedly, to the King, \"you must get up on that egg\r\nand try to keep it warm.\"\r\n\r\nThe King began to protest, but I would take no denial, and presently\r\nhis Majesty was perched up on the great egg, gazing foolishly about at\r\nthe others, who were now all climbing up on their allotted eggs.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heaven!\" muttered the King, as Sir Peter settled down\r\ncomfortably on his egg, \"I am willing to give life and fortune for the\r\nsake of science, but I can't bear to hatch out eggs like a bird!\"\r\n\r\nThe Crown-Prince was now sitting patiently beside the Baron de\r\nBecasse.\r\n\r\n\"I feel in my bones,\" he murmured, \"that I'm about to hatch something.\r\nCan't you hear a tapping on the shell of your egg, Baron?\"\r\n\r\n\"Parbleu!\" replied the Baron. \"The shell is moving under me.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly was; for, the next moment, the Baron fell into his egg\r\nwith a crash and a muffled shriek, and floundered out, dripping,\r\nyellow as a canary.\r\n\r\n\"N'importe!\" he cried, excitedly. \"Allons! Save the eggs! Hurrah! Vive\r\nla science!\" And he scrambled up on the fourth egg and sat there, arms\r\nfolded, sublime courage transfiguring him from head to foot.\r\n\r\nWe all gave him a cheer, which was hushed as the stage-manager ran in,\r\nwarning us that the audience was already assembled and in place.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to raise the curtain while we're sitting, are you?\"\r\ndemanded the King of Finland, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" I said; \"sit tight, your Majesty. Courage, gentlemen! Our\r\nvindication is at hand!\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess glanced at me with startled eyes; I took her hand,\r\nsaluted it respectfully, and then quietly led her before the curtain,\r\nfacing an ocean of upturned faces across the flaring footlights.\r\n\r\nShe stood a moment to acknowledge the somewhat ragged applause, a calm\r\nsmile on her lips. All her courage had returned; I saw that at once.\r\n\r\nVery quietly she touched her lips to the _eau-sucrée_, laid her\r\nmanuscript on the table, raised her beautiful head, and began:\r\n\r\n\"That the ux is a living bird I am here before you to prove--\"\r\n\r\nA sharp report behind the curtain drowned her voice. She paled; the\r\naudience rose amid cries of excitement.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" she asked, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Peter has hatched out his egg,\" I whispered. \"Hark! There goes\r\nanother egg!\" And I ran behind the curtain.\r\n\r\nSuch a scene as I beheld was never dreamed of on land or sea. Two\r\nenormous young uxen, all over gigantic pin-feathers, were wandering\r\nstupidly about. Mounted on one was Sir Peter Grebe, eyes starting from\r\nhis apoplectic visage; on the other, clinging to the bird's neck, hung\r\nthe Baron de Becasse.\r\n\r\nBefore I could move, the two remaining eggs burst, and a pair of huge,\r\nscrawny fledglings rose among the débris, bearing off on their backs\r\nthe King and Crown-Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Help!\" said the King of Finland, faintly. \"I'm falling off!\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to his aid, but tripped on the curtain-spring. The next\r\ninstant the green curtain shot up, and there, revealed to that vast\r\nand distinguished audience, roamed four enormous chicks, bearing on\r\ntheir backs the most respected and exclusive aristocracy of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Suzanne turned with a little shriek of horror, then sat\r\ndown in her chair, laid her lovely head on the table, and very quietly\r\nfainted away, unconscious of the frantic cheers which went roaring to\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the _true_ history of the famous exposition scandal.\r\nAnd, as I have said, had it not been for the presence in that audience\r\nof two American reporters nobody would have known what all the world\r\nnow knows--nobody would have read of the marvellous feats of bareback\r\nriding indulged in by the King of Finland--nobody would have read how\r\nSir Peter Grebe steered his mount safely past the footlights only to\r\ncome to grief over the prompter's box.\r\n\r\nBut this _is_ scandal. And, as for the charming Countess Suzanne\r\nd'Alzette, the public has heard all that it is entitled to hear, and\r\nmuch that it is not entitled to hear.\r\n\r\nHowever, on second thoughts, perhaps the public is entitled to hear a\r\nlittle more. I will therefore say this much--the shock of astonishment\r\nwhich stunned me when the curtain flew up, revealing the\r\nKing-bestridden uxen, was nothing to the awful blow which smote me\r\nwhen the Count d'Alzette leaped from the orchestra, over the\r\nfootlights, and bore away with him the fainting form of his wife, the\r\nlovely Countess d'Alzette.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder--but, as I have repeatedly observed, this dull and\r\npedantic narrative of fact is no vehicle for sentimental soliloquy. It\r\nis, then, merely sufficient to say that I took the earliest steamer\r\nfor kinder shores, spurred on to haste by a venomous cable-gram from\r\nthe Smithsonian, repudiating me, and by another from Bronx Park,\r\nordering me to spend the winter in some inexpensive, poisonous, and\r\nunobtrusive spot, and make a collection of isopods. The island of Java\r\nappeared to me to be as poisonously unobtrusive and inexpensive a\r\nregion as I had ever heard of; a steamer sailed from Antwerp for\r\nBatavia in twenty-four hours. Therefore, as I say, I took the\r\nnight-train for Brussels, and the steamer from Antwerp the following\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOf my uneventful voyage, of the happy and successful quest, there is\r\nlittle to relate. The Javanese are frolicsome and hospitable. There\r\nwas a girl there with features that were as delicate as though\r\nchiselled out of palest amber; and I remember she wore a most\r\nwonderful jewelled, helmet-like head-dress, and jingling bangles on\r\nher ankles, and when she danced she made most graceful and poetic\r\ngestures with her supple wrists--but that has nothing to do with\r\nisopods, absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nLetters from home came occasionally. Professor Farrago had returned to\r\nthe Bronx and had been re-elected to the high office he had so nobly\r\nheld when I first became associated with him.\r\n\r\nThrough his kindness and by his advice I remained for several years in\r\nthe Far East, until a letter from him arrived recalling me and also\r\nannouncing his own hurried and sudden departure for Florida. He also\r\nmentioned my promotion to the office of subcurator of department; so I\r\nstarted on my homeward voyage very much pleased with the world, and\r\narrived in New York on April 1, 1904, ready for a rest to which I\r\nbelieved myself entitled. And the first thing that they handed me was\r\na letter from Professor Farrago, summoning me South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter that started me--I was going to say startled me, but only\r\nimaginative people are startled--the letter, then, that started me\r\nfrom Bronx Park to the South I print without the permission of my\r\nsuperior, Professor Farrago. I have not obtained his permission, for\r\nthe somewhat exciting reason that nobody knows where he is. Publicity\r\nbeing now recognized as the annihilator of mysteries, a benevolent\r\npurpose alone inspires me to publish a letter so strange, so\r\npathetically remarkable, in view of what has recently occurred.\r\n\r\nAs I say, I had only just returned from Java with a valuable\r\ncollection of undescribed isopods--an order of edriophthalmous\r\ncrustaceans with seven free thoracic somites furnished with fourteen\r\nlegs--and I beg my reader's pardon, but my reader will see the\r\nnecessity for the author's absolute accuracy in insisting on detail,\r\nbecause the story that follows is a dangerous story for a scientist to\r\ntell, in view of the vast amount of nonsense and fiction in\r\ncirculation masquerading as stories of scientific adventure.\r\n\r\nI was, therefore, anticipating a delightful summer's work with pen and\r\nmicroscope, when on April 1st I received the following extraordinary\r\nletter from Professor Farrago:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"IN CAMP, LITTLE SPRITE LAKE,\r\n\r\n          \"EVERGLADES, FLORIDA, _March 15, 1902._\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR MR. GILLAND,--On receipt of this communication you\r\n    will immediately secure for me the following articles:\r\n\r\n    \"One complete outfit of woman's clothing.\r\n    \"One camera.\r\n    \"One light steel cage, large enough for you to stand in.\r\n    \"One stenographer (male sex).\r\n    \"One five-pound steel tank, with siphon and hose attachment.\r\n    \"One rifle and ammunition.\r\n    \"Three ounces rosium oxyde.\r\n    \"One ounce chlorate strontium.\r\n\r\n    \"You will then, within twenty-four hours, set out with the\r\n    stenographer and the supplies mentioned and join me in camp on\r\n    Little Sprite Lake. This order is formal and admits of no\r\n    delay. You will appreciate the necessity of absolute and\r\n    unquestioning obedience when I tell you that I am practically\r\n    on the brink of the most astonishing discovery recorded in\r\n    natural history since Monsieur Zani discovered the\r\n    purple-spotted zoombok in Nyanza; and that I depend upon you\r\n    and your zeal and fidelity for success.\r\n\r\n    \"I dare not, lest my letter fall into unscrupulous hands,\r\n    convey to you more than a hint of what lies before us in these\r\n    uncharted solitudes of the Everglades.\r\n\r\n    \"You must read between the lines when I say that because one\r\n    can see through a sheet of glass, the glass is none the less\r\n    solid and palpable. One can see _through_ it--if that is also\r\n    seeing it; but one can nevertheless hold it and feel it and\r\n    receive from it sensations of cold or heat according to its\r\n    temperature.\r\n\r\n    \"Certain jellyfish are absolutely transparent when in the\r\n    water, and one can only know of their presence by accidental\r\n    contact, not by sight.\r\n\r\n    \"_Have you ever thought that possibly there might exist larger\r\n    and more highly organized creatures transparent to eyesight,\r\n    yet palpable to touch?_\r\n\r\n    \"Little Sprite Lake is the jumping-off place; beyond lie the\r\n    Everglades, the outskirts of which are haunted by the\r\n    Seminoles, the interior of which have never been visited by\r\n    man, as far as we know.\r\n\r\n    \"As you are aware, no general survey of Florida has yet been\r\n    made; there exist no maps of the Everglades south of\r\n    Okeechobee; even Little Sprite Lake is but a vague blot on our\r\n    maps. We know, of course, that south of the eleven thousand\r\n    square miles of fresh water which is called Lake Okeechobee\r\n    the Everglades form a vast, delta-like projection of thousands\r\n    and thousands of square miles. Darkest Africa is no longer a\r\n    mystery; but the Everglades to-day remain the sombre secret of\r\n    our continent. And, to-day, this unknown expanse of swamps,\r\n    barrens, forests, and lagoons is greater than in the days of\r\n    De Soto, because the entire region has been slowly rising.\r\n\r\n    \"All this, my dear sir, you already know, and I ask your\r\n    indulgence for recalling the facts to your memory. I do it for\r\n    this reason--the search for _what I am seeking_ may lead us to\r\n    utter destruction; and therefore my formal orders to you\r\n    should be modified to this extent:--do you volunteer? If you\r\n    volunteer, my orders remain; if not, turn this letter over to\r\n    Mr. Kingsley, who will find for me the companion I require.\r\n\r\n    \"In the event of your coming, you must break your journey at\r\n    False Cape and ask for an old man named Slunk. He will give\r\n    you a packet; you will give him a dollar, and drive on to Cape\r\n    Canaveral, and you will do what is to be done there. From\r\n    there to Fort Kissimmee, to Okeechobee, traversing the lake to\r\n    the Rita River, where I have marked the trail to Little\r\n    Sprite.\r\n\r\n    \"At Little Sprite I shall await you; beyond that point a\r\n    merciful Providence alone can know what awaits us.\r\n\r\n          \"Yours fraternally,\r\n\r\n          \"FARRAGO.\r\n\r\n    \"P.S.--I think that you had better make your will, and suggest\r\n    the same idea to the stenographer who is to accompany you.\r\n\r\n              F.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was the letter I received while seated comfortably on the\r\nfloor of my work-room, surrounded by innocent isopods, all patiently\r\nawaiting scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what I did: Within twenty-four hours I had assembled the\r\nsupplies required--the cage, the woman's clothing, tank, arms and\r\nammunition, and the chemicals; I had secured accommodations, for that\r\nevening, on the Florida, Volusia, and Fort Lauderdale Railway as far\r\nas Citron City; and I had been interviewing stenographers all day\r\nlong, the result of an innocently worded advertisement in the daily\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nIt was now very close to the time when I must summon a cab and drive\r\nto the ferry; and yet I was still shy one stenographer.\r\n\r\nI had seen scores; they simply would not listen to the proposition.\r\n\"Why does a gentleman in the backwoods of Florida want a\r\nstenographer?\" they demanded; and as I had not the faintest idea, I\r\ncould only say so. I think the majority interviewed concluded I had\r\nescaped from a State institution.\r\n\r\nAs the time for departure approached I became desperate, urging and\r\nbeseeching applicants to accompany me; but neither sympathy for my\r\ninstant need nor desire for salary moved them.\r\n\r\nI waited until the last moment, hoping against hope. Then, with a\r\ngroan of despair, I seized luggage and raincoat, made for the door and\r\nflung it open, only to find myself face to face with an attractive\r\nyoung girl, apparently on the point of pressing the electric button.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but I have a train to catch.\"\r\n\r\nShe was noticeably attractive in her storm-coat and pretty hat, and I\r\nreally was sorry--so sorry that I added:\r\n\r\n\"I have about twenty-seven seconds to place at your service before I\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty will be sufficient,\" she replied, pleasantly. \"I saw your\r\nadvertisement for a stenographer--\"\r\n\r\n\"We require a man,\" I interposed, hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Have you engaged him?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't accept, anyway,\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't leave town, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you required it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Go to Florida?\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes--if I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think of the alligators! Think of the snakes--big, bitey snakes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious!\" she exclaimed, eyes growing bigger.\r\n\r\n\"Indians, too!--unreconciled, sulky Seminoles! Fevers! Mud-puddles!\r\nSpiders! And only fifty dollars a week--\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'll go,\" she stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Go?\" I repeated, grimly; \"then you've exactly two and three-quarter\r\nseconds left for preparations.\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively she raised her little gloved hand and patted her hair.\r\n\"I'm ready,\" she said, unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"One extra second to make your will,\" I added, stunned by her\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\n\"I--I have nothing to leave--nobody to leave it to,\" she said,\r\nsmiling; \"I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nI took that extra second myself for a lightning course in reflection\r\nupon effects and consequences.\r\n\r\n\"It's silly, it's probably murder,\" I said, \"but you're engaged! Now\r\nwe must run for it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is how I came to engage the services of Miss Helen Barrison\r\nas stenographer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon on the second day I disembarked from the train at Citron City\r\nwith all paraphernalia--cage, chemicals, arsenal, and stenographer; an\r\naccumulation of very dusty impedimenta--all but the stenographer. By\r\nthree o'clock our hotel livery-rig was speeding along the beach at\r\nFalse Cape towards the tall lighthouse looming above the dunes.\r\n\r\nThe abode of a gentleman named Slunk was my goal. I sat brooding in\r\nthe rickety carriage, still dazed by the rapidity of my flight from\r\nNew York; the stenographer sat beside me, blue eyes bright with\r\nexcitement, fair hair blowing in the sea-wind.\r\n\r\nOur railway companionship had been of the slightest, also absolutely\r\nformal; for I was too absorbed in conjecturing the meaning of this\r\njourney to be more than absent-mindedly civil; and she, I fancy, had\r\nhad time for repentance and perhaps for a little fright, though I\r\ncould discover traces of neither.\r\n\r\nI remember she left the train at some city or other where we were held\r\nfor an hour; and out of the car-window I saw her returning with a\r\nbrand-new grip sack.\r\n\r\nShe must have bought clothes, for she continued to remain cool and\r\nfresh in her summer shirt-waists and short outing skirt; and she\r\nlooked immaculate now, sitting there beside me, the trace of a smile\r\ncurving her red mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking for a personage named Slunk,\" I observed.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's silent consideration of the Atlantic Ocean she said,\r\n\"When do my duties begin, Mr. Gilland?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord alone knows,\" I replied, grimly. \"Are you repenting of your\r\nbargain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite happy,\" she said, serenely.\r\n\r\nRemorse smote me that I had consented to engage this frail,\r\npink-and-ivory biped for an enterprise which lay outside the suburbs\r\nof Manhattan. I glanced guiltily at my victim; she sat there, the\r\nincarnation of New York piquancy--a translated denizen of the\r\nmetropolis--a slender spirit of the back offices of sky-scrapers. Why\r\nhad I lured her hither?--here where the heavy, lavender-tinted\r\nbreakers thundered on a lost coast; here where above the dune-jungles\r\nvultures soared, and snowy-headed eagles, hulking along the sands,\r\ntore dead fish and yelped at us as we passed.\r\n\r\nStrange waters, strange skies--a strange, lost land aquiver under an\r\nexotic sun; and there she sat with her wise eyes of a child,\r\nunconcerned, watching the world in perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n\"May I pay a little compliment to your pluck?\" I asked, amused.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" she said, smiling as the maid of Manhattan alone knows\r\nhow to smile--shyly, inquiringly--with a lingering hint of laughter in\r\nthe curled lips' corners. Then her sensitive features fell a trifle.\r\n\"Not pluck,\" she said, \"but necessity; I had no chance to choose, no\r\ntime to wait. My last dollar, Mr. Gilland, is in my purse!\"\r\n\r\nWith a gay little gesture she drew it from her shirt-front, then,\r\nsmiling, sat turning it over and over in her lap.\r\n\r\nThe sun fell on her hands, gilding the smooth skin with the first tint\r\nof sunburn. Under the corners of her eyes above the rounded cheeks a\r\npink stain lay like the first ripening flush on a wild strawberry.\r\nThat, too, was the mark left by the caress of wind and sun. I had had\r\nno idea she was so pretty.\r\n\r\n\"I think we'll enjoy this adventure,\" I said; \"don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I try to make the best of things,\" she said, gazing off into the\r\nhorizon haze. \"Look,\" she added; \"is that a man?\"\r\n\r\nA spot far away on the beach caught my eye. At first I thought it was\r\na pelican--and small wonder, too, for the dumpy, waddling,\r\ngoose-necked individual who loomed up resembled a heavy bottomed bird\r\nmore than a human being.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that could be Mr. Slunk?\" asked the stenographer, as\r\nour vehicle drew nearer.\r\n\r\nHe looked as though his name ought to be Slunk; he was digging coquina\r\nclams, and he dug with a pecking motion like a water-turkey mastering\r\na mullet too big for it.\r\n\r\nHis name was Slunk; he admitted it when I accused him. Our negro\r\ndriver drew rein, and I descended to the sand and gazed on Mr. Slunk.\r\n\r\nHe was, as I have said, not impressive, even with the tremendous\r\nbackground of sky and ocean.\r\n\r\n\"I've come something over a thousand miles to see you,\" I said,\r\nreluctant to admit that I had come as far to see such a specimen of\r\nhuman architecture.\r\n\r\nA weather-beaten grin stretched the skin that covered his face, and he\r\nshoved a hairy paw into the pockets of his overalls, digging deeply\r\ninto profound depths. First he brought to light a twist of South\r\nCarolina tobacco, which he leisurely inserted in his mouth--not,\r\napparently, for pleasure, but merely to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe second object excavated from the overalls was a small packet\r\naddressed to me. This he handed to me; I gravely handed him a silver\r\ndollar; he went back to his clam-digging, and I entered the carriage\r\nand drove on. All had been carried out according to the letter of my\r\ninstructions so far, and my spirits brightened.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind I'll read my instructions,\" I said, in high\r\ngood-humor.\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not hesitate,\" she said, smiling in sympathy.\r\n\r\nSo I opened the little packet and read:\r\n\r\n    \"Drive to Cape Canaveral along the beach. You will find a gang\r\n    of men at work on a government breakwater. The superintendent\r\n    is Mr. Rowan. Show him this letter.\r\n\r\n                \"FARRAGO.\"\r\n\r\nRather disappointed--for I had been expecting to find in the packet\r\nsome key to the interesting mystery which had sent Professor Farrago\r\ninto the Everglades--I thrust the missive into my pocket and resumed a\r\nstudy of the immediate landscape. It had not changed as we progressed:\r\nocean, sand, low dunes crowned with impenetrable tangles of wild bay,\r\nsparkleberry, and live-oak, with here and there a weather-twisted\r\npalmetto sprawling, and here and there the battered blades of cactus\r\nand Spanish-bayonet thrust menacingly forward; and over all the\r\nvultures, sailing, sailing--some mere circling motes lost in the blue\r\nabove, some sheering the earth so close that their swiftly sweeping\r\nshadows slanted continually across our road.\r\n\r\n\"I detest a buzzard,\" I said, aloud.\r\n\r\n\"I thought they were crows,\" she confessed.\r\n\r\n\"Carrion-crows--yes.\r\n\r\n    \"'The carrion-crows\r\n      Sing, Caw! caw!'\r\n\r\n--only they don't,\" I added, my song putting me in good-humor once\r\nmore. And I glanced askance at the pretty stenographer.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pleasure to be employed by agreeable people,\" she said,\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can be much more agreeable than that,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Is Professor Farrago--amusing?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well--oh, certainly--but not in--in the way I am.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly it flashed upon me that my superior was a confirmed hater of\r\nunmarried women. I had clean forgotten it; and now the full import of\r\nwhat I had done scared me silent.\r\n\r\n\"Is anything the matter?\" asked Miss Barrison.\r\n\r\n\"No--not yet,\" I said, ominously.\r\n\r\nHow on earth could I have overlooked that well-known fact. The hurry\r\nand anxiety, the stress of instant preparation and departure, had\r\nclean driven it from my absent-minded head.\r\n\r\nJogging on over the sand, I sat silent, cudgelling my brains for a\r\nsolution of the disastrous predicament I had gotten into. I pictured\r\nthe astonished rage of my superior--my probable dismissal from\r\nemployment--perhaps the general overturning and smash-up of the entire\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nA distant, dark object on the beach concentrated my distracted\r\nthoughts; it must be the breakwater at Cape Canaveral. And it was the\r\nbreakwater, swarming with negro workmen, who were swinging great\r\nblocks of coquina into cemented beds, singing and whistling at their\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI forgot my predicament when I saw a thin white man in sun-helmet and\r\nkhaki directing the work from the beach; and as our horses plodded up,\r\nI stepped out and hailed him by name.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my name is Rowan,\" he said, instantly, turning to meet me. His\r\nsharp, clear eyes included the vehicle and the stenographer, and he\r\nlifted his helmet, then looked squarely at me.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Gilland,\" I said, dropping my voice and stepping nearer.\r\n\"I have just come from Bronx Park, New York.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, waiting for something more from me; so I presented my\r\ncredentials.\r\n\r\nHis formal manner changed at once. \"Come over here and let us talk a\r\nbit,\" he said, cordially--then hesitated, glancing at Miss\r\nBarrison--\"if your wife would excuse us--\"\r\n\r\nThe pretty stenographer colored, and I dryly set Mr. Rowan\r\nright--which appeared to disturb him more than his mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Mr. Gilland, but you do not propose to take this young\r\ngirl into the Everglades, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I had proposed to do,\" I said, brusquely.\r\n\r\nPerfectly aware that I resented his inquiry, he cast a perplexed and\r\ntroubled glance at her, then slowly led the way to a great block of\r\nsun-warmed coquina, where he sat down, motioning me to do the same.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said, \"that you don't know just where you are going or\r\njust what you are expected to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you, then. You are going into the devil's own country\r\nto look for something that I fled five hundred miles to avoid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\" I said, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"That is so, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! And what is this object that I am to look for and from which you\r\nfled five hundred miles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what you ran away from?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Perhaps if I had known I should have run a thousand miles.\"\r\n\r\nWe eyed one another.\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that I'd better send Miss Barrison back to New\r\nYork?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do. It may be murder to take her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll do it!\" I said, nervously. \"Back she goes from the first\r\nrailroad station.\"\r\n\r\nIn a flash the thought came to me that here was a way to avoid the\r\nwrath of Professor Farrago--and a good excuse, too. He might forgive\r\nmy not bringing a man as stenographer in view of my limited time; he\r\nnever would forgive my presenting him with a woman.\r\n\r\n\"She must go back,\" I repeated; and it rather surprised me to find\r\nmyself already anticipating loneliness--something that never in all my\r\ntravels had I experienced before.\r\n\r\n\"By the first train,\" I added, firmly, disliking Mr. Rowan without any\r\nreason except that he had suddenly deprived me of my stenographer.\r\n\r\n\"What I have to tell you,\" he began, lighting a cigarette, the mate to\r\nwhich I declined, \"is this: Three years ago, before I entered this\r\ncontracting business, I was in the government employ as officer in the\r\nCoast Survey. Our duties took us into Florida waters; we were months\r\nat a time working on shore.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled thoughtfully at his cigarette and blew a light cloud into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"I had leave for a month once; and like an ass I prepared to spend it\r\nin a hunting-trip among the Everglades.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed his lean legs and gazed meditatively at his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" he went on, \"that we penetrated the Everglades farther\r\nthan any white man who ever lived to return. There's nothing very\r\ndismal about the Everglades--the greater part, I mean. You get high\r\nand low hummock, marshes, creeks, lakes, and all that. If you get\r\nlost, you're a goner. If you acquire fever, you're as well off as the\r\nseraphim--and not a whit better. There are the usual animals\r\nthere--bears (little black fellows) lynxes, deer, panthers,\r\nalligators, and a few stray crocodiles. As for snakes, of course\r\nthey're there, moccasins a-plenty, some rattlers, but, after all, not\r\nas many snakes as one finds in Alabama, or even northern Florida and\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n\"The Seminoles won't help you--won't even talk to you. They're a\r\nsullen pack--but not murderous, as far as I know. Beyond their inner\r\nlimits lie the unknown regions.\"\r\n\r\nHe bit the wet end from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"I went there,\" he said; \"I came out as soon as I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--for one thing, my companion died of fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fright? What at?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's something in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nHe fixed a penetrating gaze on me. \"I don't know, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see anything to frighten you?\" I insisted.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I felt something.\" He dropped his cigarette and ground it\r\ninto the sand viciously. \"To cut it short,\" he said, \"I am most\r\nunwillingly led to believe that there are--creatures--of some sort in\r\nthe Everglades--living creatures quite as large as you or I--and that\r\nthey are perfectly transparent--as transparent as a colorless\r\njellyfish.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the veiled import of Professor Farrago's letter was made\r\nclear to me. He, too, believed that.\r\n\r\n\"It embarrasses me like the devil to say such a thing,\" continued\r\nRowan, digging in the sand with his spurred heels. \"It seems so--so\r\nlike a whopping lie--it seems so childish and ridiculous--so cursed\r\ncheap! But I fled; and there you are. I might add,\" he said,\r\nindifferently, \"that I have the ordinary portion of courage allotted\r\nto normal men.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you believe these--these animals to be?\" I asked,\r\nfascinated.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\" An obstinate look came into his eyes. \"I don't know,\r\nand I absolutely refuse to speculate for the benefit of anybody. I\r\nwouldn't do it for my friend Professor Farrago; and I'm not going to\r\ndo it for you,\" he ended, laughing a rather grim laugh that somehow\r\njarred me into realizing the amazing import of his story. For I did\r\nnot doubt it, strange as it was--fantastic, incredible though it\r\nsounded in the ears of a scientist.\r\n\r\nWhat it was that carried conviction I do not know--perhaps the fact\r\nthat my superior credited it; perhaps the manner of narration. Told in\r\nquiet, commonplace phrases, by an exceedingly practical and\r\nunimaginative young man who was plainly embarrassed in the telling,\r\nthe story rang out like a shout in a cañon, startling because of the\r\nabsolute lack of emphasis employed in the telling.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Farrago asked me to speak of this to no one except the man\r\nwho should come to his assistance. He desired the first chance of\r\nclearing this--this rather perplexing matter. No doubt he didn't want\r\nexploring parties prowling about him,\" added Rowan, smiling. \"But\r\nthere's no fear of that, I fancy. I never expect to tell that story\r\nagain to anybody; I shouldn't have told him, only somehow it's worried\r\nme for three years, and though I was deadly afraid of ridicule, I\r\nfinally made up my mind that science ought to have a hack at it.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in New York last winter I summoned up courage and wrote\r\nProfessor Farrago. He came to see me at the Holland House that same\r\nevening; I told him as much as I ever shall tell anybody. That is all,\r\nMr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time I sat silent, musing over the strange words. After a\r\nwhile I asked him whether Professor Farrago was supplied with\r\nprovisions; and he said he was; that a great store of staples and tins\r\nof concentrated rations had been carried in as far as Little Sprite\r\nLake; that Professor Farrago was now there alone, having insisted upon\r\ndismissing all those he had employed.\r\n\r\n\"There was no practical use for a guide,\" added Rowan, \"because no\r\ncracker, no Indian, and no guide knows the region beyond the Seminole\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nI rose, thanking him and offering my hand. He took it and shook it in\r\nmanly fashion, saying: \"I consider Professor Farrago a very brave man;\r\nI may say the same of any man who volunteers to accompany him.\r\nGood-bye, Mr. Gilland; I most earnestly wish for your success.\r\nProfessor Farrago left this letter for you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was all. I climbed back into the rickety carriage, carrying\r\nmy unopened letter; the negro driver cracked his whip and whistled,\r\nand the horses trotted inland over a fine shell road which was to lead\r\nus across Verbena Junction to Citron City. Half an hour later we\r\ncrossed the tracks at Verbena and turned into a broad marl road. This\r\naroused me from my deep and speculative reverie, and after a few\r\nmoments I asked Miss Barrison's indulgence and read the letter from\r\nProfessor Farrago which Mr. Rowan had given me:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MR. GILLAND,--You now know all I dared not write,\r\n    fearing to bring a swarm of explorers about my ears in case\r\n    the letter was lost, and found by unscrupulous meddlers. If\r\n    you still are willing to volunteer, knowing all that I know,\r\n    join me as soon as possible. If family considerations deter\r\n    you from taking what perhaps is an insane risk, I shall not\r\n    expect you to join me. In that event, return to New York\r\n    immediately and send Kingsley.\r\n\r\n              \"Yours, F.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce is the matter with him!\" I exclaimed, irritably. \"I'll\r\ntake any chances Kingsley does!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Barrison,\" I said, plunging into the subject headfirst, \"I'm\r\nextremely sorry, but I have news that forces me to believe the journey\r\ntoo dangerous for you to attempt, so I think that it would be much\r\nbetter--\" The consternation in her pretty face checked me.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" I muttered, appalled by her silence.\r\n\r\n\"But--but you engaged me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it--I should not have done it. I only--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did engage me, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I did--er--oh, of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"But a verbal contract is binding between honorable people, isn't it,\r\nMr. Gilland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"And ours was a verbal contract; and in consideration you paid me my\r\nfirst week's salary, and I bought shirt-waists and a short skirt and\r\nthree changes of--and tooth-brushes and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" I groaned. \"But I'll fix all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't if you break your contract.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" she said, flushing up, \"I should not accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Really I do. You are going into a dangerous country and you're afraid\r\nI'll be frightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's something like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what are the dangers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alligators, big, bitey snakes--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you've said all that before!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seminoles--\"\r\n\r\n\"And that too. What else is there? Did the young man in the sun-helmet\r\ntell you of something worse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--much worse! Something so dreadfully horrible that--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not at liberty to tell you, Miss Barrison,\" I said, striving to\r\nappear shocked.\r\n\r\n\"It would not make any difference anyway,\" she observed, calmly. \"I'm\r\nnot afraid of anything in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are!\" I said. \"Listen to me; I'd be awfully glad to have you\r\ngo--I--I really had no idea how I'd miss you--miss such pleasant\r\ncompanionship. But it is not possible--\" The recollection of Professor\r\nFarrago's aversion suddenly returned. \"No, no,\" I said, \"it can't be\r\ndone. I'm most unhappy over this mistake of mine; please don't look as\r\nthough you were ready to cry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't discharge me, Mr. Gilland,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a brute to do it, but I must; I was a bigger brute to engage you,\r\nbut I did. Don't--please don't look at me that way, Miss Barrison! As\r\na matter of fact, I'm tender-hearted and I can't endure it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you only knew what I had been through you wouldn't send me away,\"\r\nshe said, in a low voice. \"It took my last penny to clothe myself and\r\npay for the last lesson at the college of stenography. I--I lived on\r\nalmost nothing for weeks; every respectable place was filled; I walked\r\nand walked and walked, and nobody wanted me--they all required people\r\nwith experience--and how can I have experience until I begin, Mr.\r\nGilland? I was perfectly desperate when I went to see you, knowing\r\nthat you had advertised for a man--\" The slightest break in her clear\r\nvoice scared me.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to cry,\" she said, striving to smile. \"If I must go, I\r\nwill go. I--I didn't mean to say all this--but--but I've been so--so\r\ndiscouraged;--and you were not very cross with me--\"\r\n\r\nSmitten with remorse, I picked up her hand and fell to patting it\r\nviolently, trying to think of something to say. The exercise did not\r\nappear to stimulate my wits.\r\n\r\n\"Then--then I'm to go with you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I will see,\" I said, weakly, \"but I fear there's trouble ahead for\r\nthis expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear there is,\" she agreed, in a cheerful voice. \"You have a rifle\r\nand a cage in your luggage. Are you going to trap Indians and have me\r\nreport their language?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not going to trap Indians,\" I said, sharply. \"They may trap\r\nus--but that's a detail. What I want to say to you is this: Professor\r\nFarrago detests unmarried women, and I forgot it when I engaged you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that all?\" she asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Not all, but enough to cost me my position.\"\r\n\r\n\"How absurd! Why, there are millions of things we might\r\ndo!--millions!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's one of them?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we might pretend to be married!\" Her frank and absolutely\r\ninnocent delight in this suggestion was refreshing, but troubling.\r\n\r\n\"We would have to be demonstrative to make that story go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Well-bred people are not demonstrative in public,\" she retorted,\r\nturning a trifle pink.\r\n\r\n\"No, but in private--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there is no necessity for carrying a pleasantry into our\r\nprivate life,\" she said, in a perfectly amiable voice. \"Anyway, if\r\nProfessor Farrago's feelings are to be spared, no sacrifice on the\r\npart of a mere girl could be too great,\" she added, gayly; \"I will\r\nwear men's clothes if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have to anyhow in the jungle,\" I said; \"and as it's not an\r\nuncommon thing these days, nobody would ever take you for anything\r\nexcept what you are--a very wilful and plucky and persistent and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And what, Mr. Gilland?\"\r\n\r\n\"And attractive,\" I muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome,\" I snapped. The near whistle of a locomotive warned\r\nus, and I rose in the carriage, looking out across the sand-hills.\r\n\r\n\"That is probably our train,\" observed the pretty stenographer.\r\n\r\n\"_Our_ train!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you insist--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no, Mr. Gilland; I only trust implicitly in my employer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll wait till we get to Citron City,\" I said, weakly; \"then it will\r\nbe time enough to discuss the situation, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" she said, smiling; but she knew, and I already feared,\r\nthat the situation no longer admitted of discussion. In a few moments\r\nmore we emerged, without warning, from the scrub-crested sand-hills\r\ninto the single white street of Citron City, where China-trees hung\r\nheavy with bloom, and magnolias, already set with perfumed candelabra,\r\nspread soft, checkered shadows over the marl.\r\n\r\nThe train lay at the station, oceans of heavy, black smoke lazily\r\nflowing from the locomotive; negroes were hoisting empty fruit-crates\r\naboard the baggage-car, through the door of which I caught a glimpse\r\nof my steel cage and remaining paraphernalia, all securely crated.\r\n\r\n\"Telegram hyah foh Mistuh Gilland,\" remarked the operator, lounging at\r\nhis window as we descended from our dusty vehicle. He had not\r\naddressed himself to anybody in particular, but I said that I was Mr.\r\nGilland, and he produced the envelope. \"Toted in from Okeechobee?\" he\r\ninquired, listlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Probably; it's signed 'Farrago,' isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's foh yoh, suh, I reckon,\" said the operator, handing it out with\r\na yawn. Then he removed his hat and fanned his head, which was\r\nperfectly bald.\r\n\r\nI opened the yellow envelope. \"Get me a good dog with points,\" was the\r\nlaconic message; and it irritated me to receive such idiotic\r\ninstructions at such a time and in such a place. A good dog? Where the\r\nmischief could I find a dog in a town consisting of ten houses and a\r\nwater-tank? I said as much to the bald-headed operator, who smiled\r\nwearily and replaced his hat: \"Dawg? They's moh houn'-dawgs in Citron\r\nCity than they's wood-ticks to keep them busy. I reckon a dollah 'll\r\ndo a heap foh you, suh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you get me a dog for a dollar?\" I asked;--\"one with points?\"\r\n\r\n\"Points? I sholy can, suh;--plenty of points. What kind of dawg do yoh\r\nrequiah, suh?--live dawg? daid dawg? houn'-dawg? raid-dawg? hawg-dawg?\r\ncoon-dawg?--\"\r\n\r\nThe locomotive emitted a long, lazy, softly modulated and thoroughly\r\nSouthern toot. I handed the operator a silver dollar, and he presently\r\nemerged from his office and slouched off up the street, while I walked\r\nwith Miss Barrison to the station platform, where I resumed the\r\ndiscussion of her future movements.\r\n\r\n\"You are very young to take such a risk,\" I said, gravely. \"Had I not\r\nbetter buy your ticket back to New York? The north-bound train meets\r\nthis one. I suppose we are waiting for it now--\" I stopped, conscious\r\nof her impatience.\r\n\r\nHer face flushed brightly: \"Yes; I think it best. I have embarrassed\r\nyou too long already--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that!\" I muttered. \"I--I--shall be deadly bored without\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not an entertainer, only a stenographer,\" she said, curtly.\r\n\"Please get me my ticket, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed at me from the car-platform; the locomotive tooted two\r\ndrawling toots.\r\n\r\n\"It is for your sake,\" I said, avoiding her gaze as the far-off\r\nwhistle of the north-bound express came floating out of the blue\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer; I fished out my watch, regarding it in silence,\r\nlistening to the hum of the approaching train, which ought presently\r\nto bear her away into the North, where nothing could menace her except\r\nthe brilliant pitfalls of a Christian civilization. But I stood\r\nthere, temporizing, unable to utter a word as her train shot by us\r\nwith a rush, slower, slower, and finally stopped, with a long-drawn\r\nsigh from the air-brakes.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the telegraph-operator appeared, carrying a dog by the\r\nscruff of the neck--a sad-eyed, ewe-necked dog, from the four corners\r\nof which dangled enormous, cushion-like paws. He yelped when he beheld\r\nme. Miss Barrison leaned down from the car-platform and took the\r\nanimal into her arms, uttering a suppressed exclamation of pity as she\r\nlifted him.\r\n\r\n\"You have your hands full,\" she said to me; \"I'll take him into the\r\ncar for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe mounted the steps; I followed with the valises, striving to get a\r\ngood view of my acquisition over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't the kind of dog I wanted!\" I repeated again and again,\r\ninspecting the animal as it sprawled on the floor of the car at the\r\nedge of Miss Barrison's skirt. \"That dog is all voice and feet and\r\nemotion! What makes it stick up its paws like that? I don't want that\r\ndog and I'm not going to identify myself with it! Where's the\r\noperator--\"\r\n\r\nI turned towards the car-window; the operator's bald head was visible\r\non a line with the sill, and I made motions at him. He bowed with\r\ncourtly grace, as though I were thanking him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!\" I cried, shaking my head. \"I wanted a dog with points--not\r\nthe kind of points that stick up all over this dog. Take him away!\"\r\n\r\nThe operator's head appeared to be gliding out of my range of vision;\r\nthen the windows of the north-bound train slid past, faster and\r\nfaster. A melancholy grace-note from the dog, a jolt, and I turned\r\naround, appalled.\r\n\r\n\"This train is going,\" I stammered, \"and you are on it!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison sprang up and started towards the door, and I sped after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I can jump,\" she said, breathlessly, edging out to the platform;\r\n\"please let me! There is time yet--if you only wouldn't hold me--so\r\ntight--\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later we walked slowly back together through the car and\r\ntook seats facing one another.\r\n\r\nBetween us sat the hound-dog, a prey to melancholy unutterable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on Sunday when I awoke to the realization that I had quitted\r\ncivilization and was afloat on an unfamiliar body of water in an open\r\nboat containing--\r\n\r\n    One light steel cage,\r\n    One rifle and ammunition,\r\n    One stenographer,\r\n    Three ounces rosium oxide,\r\n    One hound-dog,\r\n    Two valises.\r\n\r\nA playful wave slopped over the bow and I lost count; but the pretty\r\nstenographer made the inventory, while I resumed the oars, and the dog\r\npunctured the primeval silence with staccato yelps.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later everything and everybody was accounted for; the\r\nsky was blue and the palms waved, and several species of dicky-birds\r\ntuned up as I pulled with powerful strokes out into the sunny waters\r\nof Little Sprite Lake, now within a few miles of my journey's end.\r\n\r\nFrom ponds hidden in the marshes herons rose in lazily laborious\r\nflight, flapping low across the water; high in the cypress yellow-eyed\r\nospreys bent crested heads to watch our progress; sun-baked\r\nalligators, lying heavily in the shoreward sedge, slid open, glassy\r\neyes as we passed.\r\n\r\n\"Even the 'gators make eyes at you,\" I said, resting on my oars.\r\n\r\nWe were on terms of badinage.\r\n\r\n\"Who was it who shed crocodile tears at the prospect of shipping me\r\nNorth?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of tears,\" I observed, \"somebody is likely to shed a number\r\nwhen Professor Farrago is picked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" she said, and snapped her pretty, sun-tanned fingers; and I\r\nresumed the oars in time to avoid shipwreck on a large mud-bar.\r\n\r\nShe reclined in the stern, serenely occupied with the view, now and\r\nthen caressing the discouraged dog, now and then patting her hair\r\nwhere the wind had loosened a bright strand.\r\n\r\n\"If Professor Farrago didn't expect a woman stenographer,\" she said,\r\nabruptly, \"why did he instruct you to bring a complete outfit of\r\nwoman's clothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said, tartly.\r\n\r\n\"But you bought them. Are they for a young woman or an old woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I sent a messenger to a department store. I don't know\r\nwhat he bought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you look them over?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Why? I should have been no wiser. I fancy they're all right,\r\nbecause the bill was eighteen hundred dollars--\"\r\n\r\nThe pretty stenographer sat up abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that much?\" I asked, uneasily. \"I've always heard women's clothing\r\nwas expensive. Wasn't it enough? I told the boy to order the\r\nbest;--Professor Farrago always requires the very best scientific\r\ninstruments, and--I listed the clothes as scientific accessories--that\r\nbeing the object of this expedition--_What_ are you laughing at?\"\r\n\r\nWhen it pleased her to recover her gravity she announced her desire to\r\ninspect and repack the clothing; but I refused.\r\n\r\n\"They're for Professor Farrago,\" I said. \"I don't know what he wants\r\nof them. I don't suppose he intends to wear 'em and caper about the\r\njungle, but they're his. I got them because he told me to. I bought a\r\ncage, too, to fit myself, but I don't suppose he means to put me in\r\nit. Perhaps,\" I added, \"he may invite you into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me refold the gowns,\" she pleaded, persuasively. \"What does a\r\nclumsy man know about packing such clothing as that? If you don't,\r\nthey'll be ruined. It's a shame to drag those boxes about through mud\r\nand water!\"\r\n\r\nSo we made a landing, and lifted out and unlocked the boxes. All I\r\ncould see inside were mounds of lace and ribbons, and with a vague\r\nidea that Miss Barrison needed no assistance I returned to the boat\r\nand sat down to smoke until she was ready.\r\n\r\nWhen she summoned me her face was flushed and her eyes bright.\r\n\r\n\"Those are certainly the most beautiful things!\" she said, softly.\r\n\"Why, it is like a bride's trousseau--absolutely complete--all except\r\nthe bridal gown--\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there a dress there?\" I exclaimed, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"No--not a day-dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Night-dresses!\" I shrieked. \"He doesn't want women's night-dresses!\r\nHe's a bachelor! Good Heavens! I've done it this time!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but who is to wear them?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know? I don't know anything; I can only presume that he\r\ndoesn't intend to open a department store in the Everglades. And if\r\nany lady is to wear garments in his vicinity, I assume that those\r\ngarments are to be anything except diaphanous!... Please take your\r\nseat in the boat, Miss Barrison. I want to row and think.\"\r\n\r\nI had had my fill of exercise and thought when, about four o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, Miss Barrison directed my attention to a point of palms\r\njutting out into the water about a mile to the southward.\r\n\r\n\"That's Farrago!\" I exclaimed, catching sight of a United States flag\r\nfloating majestically from a bamboo-pole. \"Give me the megaphone, if\r\nyou please.\"\r\n\r\nShe handed me the instrument; I hailed the shore; and presently a man\r\nappeared under the palms at the water's edge.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" I roared, trying to inject cheerfulness into the hollow\r\nbellow. \"How are you, professor?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came distinctly across the water:\r\n\r\n\"_Who_ is that with you?\"\r\n\r\nMy lips were buried in the megaphone; I strove to speak; I only\r\nproduced a ghastly, chuckling sound.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you expect to tell the truth,\" observed the pretty\r\nstenographer, quietly.\r\n\r\nI removed my lips from the megaphone and looked around at her. She\r\nreturned my gaze with a disturbing smile.\r\n\r\n\"I want to mitigate the blow,\" I said, hoarsely. \"Tell me how.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" she said, sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, _I_ do!\" I fairly barked, and seizing the megaphone again, I\r\nset it to my lips and roared, \"My fiancée!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Miss Barrison, in consternation, \"I thought\r\nyou were going to tell the truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that or you'll upset us,\" I snapped--\"I'm telling the truth;\r\nI've engaged myself to you; I did it mentally before I bellowed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"You know as well as I do what engagements mean,\" I said, picking up\r\nthe oars and digging them deep in the blue water.\r\n\r\nShe assented uncertainly.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more of vigorous rowing brought us to a muddy landing\r\nunder a cluster of tall palmettos, where a gasoline launch lay.\r\nProfessor Farrago came down to the shore as I landed, and I walked\r\nahead to meet him. He was the maddest man I ever saw. But I was his\r\nmatch, for I was desperate.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil--\" he began, under his breath.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, deliberately. \"An engaged woman is practically\r\nmarried already, because marriages are made in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" he gasped, \"are you mad, Gilland? I sent for a\r\nstenographer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Barrison is a stenographer,\" I said, calmly; and before he could\r\nrecover I had presented him, and left them face to face, washing my\r\nhands of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nUnloading the boat and carrying the luggage up under the palms, I\r\nheard her saying:\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not in the least afraid of snakes, and I am quite ready to\r\nbegin my duties.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he: \"Mr. Gilland is a young man who--er--lacks practical\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she: \"Mr. Gilland has been most thoughtful for my comfort. The\r\njourney has been perfectly heavenly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he, clumsily: \"Ahem!--the--er--celestial aspect of your journey\r\nhas--er--doubtless been colored by--er--the prospect of\r\nyour--er--approaching nuptials--\"\r\n\r\nShe, hastily: \"Oh, I do not think so, professor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Idiot!\" I muttered, dragging the dog to the shore, where his yelps\r\nbrought the professor hurrying.\r\n\r\n\"Is _that_ the dog?\" he inquired, adjusting his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"That's the dog,\" I said. \"He's full of points, you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" mused the professor; \"I thought he was full of--\" He hesitated,\r\ninspecting the animal, who, nose to the ground, stood investigating a\r\nsmell of some sort.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" I said, with enthusiasm, \"he's found a scent; he's trailing it\r\nalready! Now he's rolling on it!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's rolling on one of our concentrated food lozenges,\" said the\r\nprofessor, dryly. \"Tie him up, Mr. Gilland, and ask Mrs. Gilland to\r\ncome up to camp. Your room is ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rooms,\" I corrected; \"she isn't Mrs. Gilland yet,\" I added, with a\r\nforced smile.\r\n\r\n\"But you're practically married,\" observed the professor, \"as you\r\npointed out to me. And if she's practically Mrs. Gilland, why not say\r\nso?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, all the same,\" I snarled.\r\n\r\n\"But marriages are made in--\"\r\n\r\nI cast a desperate eye upon him.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, whenever we were alone together, he made a target of\r\nme. I never had supposed him humorously vindictive; he was, and his\r\napparently innocent mistakes almost turned my hair gray.\r\n\r\nBut to Miss Barrison he was kind and courteous, and for a time\r\nover-serious. Observing him, I could never detect the slightest\r\nsymptom of dislike for her sex--a failing which common rumor had\r\nalways credited him with to the verge of absolute rudeness.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it was perfectly plain to anybody that he liked her.\r\nThere was in his manner towards her a mixture of business formality\r\nand the deferential attitude of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nWe were seated, just before sunset, outside of the hut built of\r\npalmetto logs, when Professor Farrago, addressing us both, began the\r\nexplanation of our future duties.\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison, it appeared, was to note everything said by himself,\r\nmaking several shorthand copies by evening. In other words, she was to\r\nreport every scrap of conversation she heard while in the Everglades.\r\nAnd she nodded intelligently as he finished, and drew pad and pencil\r\nfrom the pocket of her walking-skirt, jotting down his instructions as\r\na beginning. I could see that he was pleased.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I do this,\" he said, \"is because I do not wish to hide\r\nanything that transpires while we are on this expedition. Only the\r\nmost scrupulously minute record can satisfy me; no details are too\r\nsmall to merit record; I demand and I court from my fellow-scientists\r\nand from the public the fullest investigation.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled slightly, turning towards me.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Mr. Gilland, how dangerous to the reputation of a\r\nscientific man is any line of investigation into the unusual. If a man\r\nonce is even suspected of charlatanism, of sensationalism, of turning\r\nhis attention to any phenomena not strictly within the proper pale of\r\nscientific investigation, that man is doomed to ridicule; his\r\nprofession disowns him; he becomes a man without honor, without\r\nauthority. Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" he resumed, thoughtfully, \"as I do most firmly believe in\r\nthe course I am now pursuing, whether I succeed or fail I desire a\r\ntrue and minute record made, hiding nothing of what may be said or\r\ndone. A stenographer alone can give this to the world, while I can\r\nonly supplement it with a description of events--if I live to\r\ntranscribe them.\"\r\n\r\nSunk in profound reverie he sat there silent under the great, smooth\r\npalm-tree--a venerable figure in his yellow dressing-gown and carpet\r\nslippers. Seated side by side, we waited, a trifle awed. I could hear\r\nthe soft breathing of the pretty stenographer beside me.\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" said Professor Farrago, looking up, \"I must be able to\r\ntrust those who are here to aid me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I will be faithful,\" said the girl, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt you, my child,\" he said; \"nor you, Gilland. And so I\r\nam going to tell you this much now--more, I hope, later.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sat up straight, lifting an impressive forefinger.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rowan, lately an officer of our Coast Survey, wrote me a letter\r\nfrom the Holland House in New York--a letter so strange that, on\r\nreading it, I immediately repaired to his hotel, where for hours we\r\ntalked together.\r\n\r\n\"The result of that conference is this expedition.\r\n\r\n\"I have now been here two months, and I am satisfied of certain facts.\r\nFirst, there do exist in this unexplored wilderness certain forms of\r\nlife which are solid and palpable, but transparent and practically\r\ninvisible. Second, these living creatures belong to the animal\r\nkingdom, are warm-blooded vertebrates, possess powers of locomotion,\r\nbut whether that of flight I am not certain. Third, they appear to\r\npossess such senses as we enjoy--smell, touch, sight, hearing, and no\r\ndoubt the sense of taste. Fourth, their skin is smooth to the touch,\r\nand the temperature of the epidermis appears to approximate that of a\r\nnormal human being. Fifth and last, whether bipeds or quadrupeds I do\r\nnot know, though all evidence appears to confirm my theory that they\r\nwalk erect. One pair of their limbs appear to terminate in a sort of\r\nfoot--like a delicately shaped human foot, except that there appear to\r\nbe no toes. The other pair of limbs terminate in something that, from\r\nthe single instance I experienced, seemed to resemble soft but firm\r\nantennæ or, perhaps, digitated palpi--\"\r\n\r\n\"Feelers!\" I blurted out.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but I think so. Once, when I was standing in the\r\nforest, perfectly aware that creatures I could not see had stealthily\r\nsurrounded me, the tension was brought to a crisis when over my face,\r\nfrom cheek to chin, stole a soft something, brushing the skin as\r\ndelicately as a child's fingers might brush it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" I breathed.\r\n\r\nA care-worn smile crept into his eyes. \"A test for nerves, you think,\r\nMr. Gilland? I agree with you. Nobody fears what anybody can see.\"\r\n\r\nThere came the slightest movement beside me.\r\n\r\n\"Are you trembling?\" I asked, turning.\r\n\r\n\"I was writing,\" she replied, steadily. \"Did my elbow touch you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By-the-way,\" said Professor Farrago, \"I fear I forgot to congratulate\r\nyou upon your choice of a stenographer, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\nA rosy light stole over her pale face.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to record that too?\" she asked, raising her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"But, professor,\" I began, a prey to increasing excitement, \"do you\r\npropose to attempt the capture of one of these animals?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what the cage is for,\" he said. \"I supposed you had guessed\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had,\" murmured the pretty stenographer.\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt it,\" said Professor Farrago, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"What are the chemicals for--and the tank and hose attachment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think, Mr. Gilland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't; I'm almost stunned by what you tell me.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"The rosium oxide and salts of strontium are to be dumped\r\ninto the tank together. They'll effervesce, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I muttered.\r\n\r\n\"And I can throw a rose-colored spray over any object by the hose\r\nattachment, can't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I tried it on a transparent jelly-fish and it became perfectly\r\nvisible and of a beautiful rose-color: and I tried it on rock-crystal,\r\nand on glass, and on pure gelatine, and all became suffused with a\r\ndelicate pink glow, which lasted for hours or minutes according to the\r\nsubstance.... Now you understand, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you want to see what sort of creature you have to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; so when I've trapped it I am going to spray it.\" He turned\r\nhalf humorously towards the stenographer: \"I fancy you understood long\r\nbefore Mr. Gilland did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" she said, with a sidelong lifting of the heavy\r\nlashes; and I caught the color of her eyes for a second.\r\n\r\n\"You see how Miss Barrison spares your feelings,\" observed Professor\r\nFarrago, dryly. \"She owes you little gratitude for bringing her here,\r\nyet she proves a generous victim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am very grateful for this rarest of chances!\" she said, shyly.\r\n\"To be among the first in the world to discover such wonders ought to\r\nmake me very grateful to the man who gave me the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean Mr. Gilland?\" asked the professor, laughing.\r\n\r\nI had never before seen Professor Farrago laugh such a care-free\r\nlaugh; I had never suspected him of harboring even an embryo of the\r\nsocial graces. Dry as dust, sapless as steel, precise as the magnetic\r\nneedle, he had hitherto been to me the mummified embodiment of science\r\nmilitant. Now, in the guise of a perfectly human and genial old\r\ngentleman, I scarcely recognized my superior of the Bronx Park\r\nsociety. And as a woman-hater he was a miserable failure.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens,\" I thought to myself, \"am I becoming jealous of my revered\r\nprofessor's social success with a stray stenographer?\" I felt mean,\r\nand I probably looked it, and I was glad that telepathy did not permit\r\nMiss Barrison to record my secret and unworthy ruminations.\r\n\r\nThe professor was saying: \"These transparent creatures break off\r\nberries and fruits and branches; I have seen a flower, too, plucked\r\nfrom its stem by invisible digits and borne swiftly through the\r\nforest--only the flower visible, apparently speeding through the air\r\nand out of sight among the thickets.\r\n\r\n\"I have found the footprints that I described to you, usually on the\r\nedge of a stream or in the soft loam along some forest lake or lost\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Again and again I have been conscious in the forest that unseen eyes\r\nwere fixed on me, that unseen shapes were following me. Never but that\r\none time did these invisible creatures close in around me and venture\r\nto touch me.\r\n\r\n\"They may be weak; their structure may be frail, and they may be\r\nincapable of violence or harm, but the depth of the footprints\r\nindicates a weight of at least one hundred and thirty pounds, and it\r\ncertainly requires some muscular strength to break off a branch of\r\nwild guavas.\"\r\n\r\nHe bent his noble head, thoughtfully regarding the design on his\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\n\"What was the rifle for?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Defence, not aggression,\" he said, simply.\r\n\r\n\"And the camera?\"\r\n\r\n\"A camera record is necessary in these days of bad artists.\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated, glancing at Miss Barrison. She was still writing, her\r\npretty head bent over the pad in her lap.\r\n\r\n\"And the clothing?\" I asked, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get it?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Of course--\" I glanced at Miss Barrison. \"There's no use writing down\r\neverything, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything must be recorded,\" said Professor Farrago, inflexibly.\r\n\"What clothing did you buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot the gown,\" I said, getting red about the ears.\r\n\r\n\"Forgot the gown!\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--one kind of gown--the day kind. I--I got the other kind.\"\r\n\r\nHe was annoyed; so was I. After a moment he got up, and crossing to\r\nthe log cabin, opened one of the boxes of apparel.\r\n\r\n\"Is it what you wanted?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Y-es, I presume so,\" he replied, visibly perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"It's the best to be had,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"That's quite right,\" he said, musingly. \"We use only the best of\r\neverything at Bronx Park. It is traditional with us, you know.\"\r\n\r\nCuriosity pushed me. \"Well, what on earth is it for?\" I broke out.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me gravely over the tops of his spectacles--a striking\r\nand inspiring figure in his yellow flannel dressing-gown and\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell you some day--perhaps,\" he said, mildly. \"Good-night,\r\nMiss Barrison; good-night, Mr. Gilland. You will find extra blankets\r\non your bunk--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Bunks,\" he said, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is something weird about this whole proceeding,\" I observed to\r\nthe pretty stenographer next morning.\r\n\r\n\"These pies will be weird if you don't stop talking to me,\" she said,\r\nopening the doors of Professor Farrago's portable camping-oven and\r\npeeping in at the fragrant pastry.\r\n\r\nThe professor had gone off somewhere into the woods early that\r\nmorning. As he was not in the habit of talking to himself, the\r\nservices of Miss Barrison were not required. Before he started,\r\nhowever, he came to her with a request for a dozen pies, the\r\nconstruction of which he asked if she understood. She had been to\r\ncooking-school in more prosperous days, and she mentioned it; so at\r\nhis earnest solicitation she undertook to bake for him twelve\r\napple-pies; and she was now attempting it, assisted by advice from me.\r\n\r\n\"Are they burned?\" I asked, sniffing the air.\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not burned, Mr. Gilland, but my finger is,\" she\r\nretorted, stepping back to examine the damage.\r\n\r\nI offered sympathy and witch-hazel, but she would have none of my\r\nofferings, and presently returned to her pies.\r\n\r\n\"We can't eat all that pastry,\" I protested.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Farrago said they were not for us to eat,\" she said,\r\ndusting each pie with powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are they for? The dog? Or are they simply objets d'art to\r\nadorn the shanty--\"\r\n\r\n\"You annoy me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The pies annoy me; won't you tell me what they're for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a pretty fair idea what they're for,\" she observed, tossing\r\nher head. \"Haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What?\"\r\n\r\n\"These pies are for bait.\"\r\n\r\n\"To bait hooks with?\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Hooks! No, you silly man. They're for baiting the cage. He means to\r\ntrap these transparent creatures in a cage baited with pie.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed scornfully; inserted the burned tip of her finger in her\r\nmouth and stood looking at me defiantly like a flushed and bright-eyed\r\nschool-girl.\r\n\r\n\"You think you're teasing me,\" she said; \"but you do not realize what\r\na singularly slow-minded young man you are.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped laughing. \"How did you come to the conclusion that pies were\r\nto be used for such a purpose?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I deduce,\" she observed, with an airy wave of her disengaged hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your deductions are weird--like everything else in this vicinity.\r\nPies to catch invisible monsters? Pooh!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not particularly complimentary, are you?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly; but I could be, with you for my inspiration. I\r\ncould even be enthusiastic--\"\r\n\r\n\"About my pies?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--about your eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very frivolous--for a scientist,\" she said, scornfully;\r\n\"please subdue your enthusiasm and bring me some wood. This fire is\r\nalmost out.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had brought the wood, she presented me with a pail of hot water\r\nand pointed at the dishes on the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" I cried, revolted.\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose I must do them--\"\r\n\r\nShe looked pensively at her scorched finger-tip, and, pursing up her\r\nred lips, blew a gentle breath to cool it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do the dishes,\" I said.\r\n\r\nSplashing and slushing the cups and saucers about in the hot water, I\r\nreflected upon the events of the last few days. The dog, stupefied by\r\nunwonted abundance of food, lay in the sunshine, sleeping the sleep of\r\nrepletion; the pretty stenographer, all rosy from her culinary\r\nexertions, was removing the pies and setting them in neat rows to\r\ncool.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" she said, with a sigh; \"now I will dry the dishes for you....\r\nYou didn't mention the fact, when you engaged me, that I was also\r\nexpected to do general housework.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't engage you,\" I said, maliciously; \"you engaged me, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nShe regarded me disdainfully, nose uptilted.\r\n\r\n\"How thoroughly disagreeable you can be!\" she said. \"Dry your own\r\ndishes. I'm going for a stroll.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I join--\"\r\n\r\n\"You may _not_! I shall go so far that you cannot possibly discover\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nI watched her forestward progress; she sauntered for about thirty\r\nyards along the lake and presently sat down in plain sight under a\r\nhuge live-oak.\r\n\r\nA few moments later I had completed my task as general bottle-washer,\r\nand I cast about for something to occupy me.\r\n\r\nFirst I approached and politely caressed the satiated dog. He woke up,\r\nregarded me with dully meditative eyes, yawned, and went to sleep\r\nagain. Never a flop of tail to indicate gratitude for blandishments,\r\nnever the faintest symptom of canine appreciation.\r\n\r\nChilled by my reception, I moused about for a while, poking into boxes\r\nand bundles; then raised my head and inspected the landscape. Through\r\nthe vista of trees the pink shirt-waist of the pretty stenographer\r\nglimmered like a rose blooming in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point I viewed the prospect that pink spot seemed to\r\nintrude; I turned my back and examined the jungle, but there it was\r\nrepeated in a hundred pink blossoms among the massed thickets; I\r\nlooked up into the tree-tops, where pink mosses spotted the palms; I\r\nlooked out over the lake, and I saw it in my mind's eye pinker than\r\never. It was certainly a case of pink-eye.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go for a stroll, too; it's a free country,\" I muttered.\r\n\r\nAfter I had strolled in a complete circle I found myself within three\r\nfeet of a pink shirt-waist.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said; \"I had no inten--\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were never coming,\" she said, amiably.\r\n\r\n\"How is your finger?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe held it up. I took it gingerly; it was smooth and faintly rosy at\r\nthe tip.\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Dreadfully. Your hands feel so cool--\"\r\n\r\nAfter a silence she said, \"Thank you, that has cooled the burning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am determined,\" said I, \"to expel the fire from your finger if it\r\ntakes hours and hours.\" And I seated myself with that intention.\r\n\r\nFor a while she talked, making innocent observations concerning the\r\ntropical foliage surrounding us. Then silence crept in between us,\r\naccentuated by the brooding stillness of the forest.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid your hands are growing tired,\" she said, considerately.\r\n\r\nI denied it.\r\n\r\nThrough the vista of palms we could see the lake, blue as a violet,\r\nsparkling with silvery sunshine. In the intense quiet the splash of\r\nleaping mullet sounded distinctly.\r\n\r\nOnce a tall crane stalked into view among the sedges; once an unseen\r\nalligator shook the silence with his deep, hollow roaring. Then the\r\nstillness of the wilderness grew more intense.\r\n\r\nWe had been sitting there for a long while without exchanging a word,\r\ndreamily watching the ripple of the azure water, when all at once\r\nthere came a scurrying patter of feet through the forest, and, looking\r\nup, I beheld the hound-dog, tail between his legs, bearing down on us\r\nat lightning speed. I rose instantly.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with the dog?\" cried the pretty stenographer. \"Is\r\nhe going mad, Mr. Gilland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something has scared him,\" I exclaimed, as the dog, eyes like lighted\r\ncandles, rushed frantically between my legs and buried his head in\r\nMiss Barrison's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Poor doggy!\" she said, smoothing the collapsed pup; \"poor, p-oor\r\nlittle beast! Did anything scare him? Tell aunty all about it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a dog flees _without yelping_ he's a badly frightened creature. I\r\ninstinctively started back towards the camp whence the beast had fled,\r\nand before I had taken a dozen steps Miss Barrison was beside me,\r\ncarrying the dog in her arms.\r\n\r\n\"I've an idea,\" she said, under her breath.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I asked, keeping my eyes on the camp.\r\n\r\n\"It's this: I'll wager that we find those pies gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pies gone?\" I repeated, perplexed; \"what makes you think--\"\r\n\r\n\"They _are_ gone!\" she exclaimed. \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nI gaped stupidly at the rough pine table where the pies had stood in\r\nthree neat rows of four each. And then, in a moment, the purport of\r\nthis robbery flashed upon my senses.\r\n\r\n\"The transparent creatures!\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" she whispered, clinging to the trembling dog in her arms.\r\n\r\nI listened. I could hear nothing, see nothing, yet slowly I became\r\nconvinced of the presence of something unseen--something in the forest\r\nclose by, watching us out of invisible eyes.\r\n\r\nA chill, settling along my spine, crept upward to my scalp, until\r\nevery separate hair wiggled to the roots. Miss Barrison was pale, but\r\nperfectly calm and self-possessed.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in-doors,\" I said, as steadily as I could.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nI held the door open; she entered with the dog; I followed, closing\r\nand barring the door, and then took my station at the window, rifle in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound in the forest. Miss Barrison laid the dog on the\r\nfloor and quietly picked up her pad and pencil. Presently she was deep\r\nin a report of the phenomena, her pencil flying, leaf after leaf from\r\nthe pad fluttering to the floor.\r\n\r\nNor did I at the window change my position of scared alertness, until\r\nI was aware of her hand gently touching my elbow to attract my\r\nattention, and her soft voice at my ear--\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose by any chance that the dog ate those pies?\"\r\n\r\nI collected my tumultuous thoughts and turned to stare at the dog.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve pies, twelve inches each in diameter,\" she reflected,\r\nmusingly. \"One dog, twenty inches in diameter. How many times will the\r\npies go into the dog? Let me see.\" She made a few figures on her pad,\r\nthought awhile, produced a tape-measure from her pocket, and, kneeling\r\ndown, measured the dog.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, looking up at me, \"he couldn't contain them.\"\r\n\r\nInspired by her coolness and perfect composure, I set the rifle in the\r\ncorner and opened the door. Sunlight fell in bars through the quiet\r\nwoods; nothing stirred on land or water save the great, yellow-striped\r\nbutterflies that fluttered and soared and floated above the flowering\r\nthickets bordering the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe heat became intense; Miss Barrison went to her room to change her\r\ngown for a lighter one; I sat down under a live-oak, eyes and ears\r\nstrained for any sign of our invisible neighbors.\r\n\r\nWhen she emerged in the lightest and filmiest of summer gowns, she\r\nbrought the camera with her; and for a while we took pictures of each\r\nother, until we had used up all but one film.\r\n\r\nDesiring to possess a picture of Miss Barrison and myself seated\r\ntogether, I tied a string to the shutter-lever and attached the other\r\nend of the string to the dog, who had resumed his interrupted\r\nslumbers. At my whistle he jumped up nervously, snapping the lever,\r\nand the picture was taken.\r\n\r\nWith such innocent and harmless pastime we whiled away the afternoon.\r\nShe made twelve more apple-pies. I mounted guard over them. And we\r\nwere just beginning to feel a trifle uneasy about Professor Farrago,\r\nwhen he appeared, tramping sturdily through the forest, green umbrella\r\nand butterfly-net under one arm, shot-gun and cyanide-jar under the\r\nother, and his breast all criss-crossed with straps, from which\r\ndangled field-glasses, collecting-boxes, and botanizing-tins--an\r\ninspiring figure indeed--the embodied symbol of science indomitable,\r\ntriumphant!\r\n\r\nWe hailed him with three guilty cheers; the dog woke up with a\r\nperfunctory bark--the first sound I had heard from him since he yelped\r\nhis disapproval of me on the lagoon.\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison produced three bowls full of boiling water and dropped\r\nthree pellets of concentrated soup-meat into them, while I prepared\r\ncoffee. And in a few moments our simple dinner was ready--the red\r\nants had been dusted from the biscuits, the spiders chased off the\r\nbaked beans, the scorpions shaken from the napkins, and we sat down at\r\nthe rough, improvised table under the palms.\r\n\r\nThe professor gave us a brief but modest account of his short tour of\r\nexploration. He had brought back a new species of orchid, several\r\nundescribed beetles, and a pocketful of coontie seed. He appeared,\r\nhowever, to be tired and singularly depressed, and presently we\r\nlearned why.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that he had gone straight to that section of the forest\r\nwhere he had hitherto always found signs of the transparent and\r\ninvisible creatures which he had determined to capture, and he had not\r\nfound a single trace of them.\r\n\r\n\"It alarms me,\" he said, gravely. \"If they have deserted this region,\r\nit might take a lifetime to locate them again in this wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nThen, very quietly, sinking her voice instinctively, as though the\r\nunseen might be at our very elbows listening, Miss Barrison recounted\r\nthe curious adventure which had befallen the dog and the first batch\r\nof apple-pies.\r\n\r\nWith visible and increasing excitement the professor listened until\r\nthe very end. Then he struck the table with clinched fist--a\r\nresounding blow which set the concentrated soup dancing in the bowls\r\nand scattered the biscuits and the industrious red ants in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"Eureka!\" he whispered. \"Miss Barrison, your deduction was not only\r\nperfectly reasonable, but brilliant. You are right; the pies are for\r\nthat very purpose. I conceived the idea when I first came here. Again\r\nand again the pies that my guide made out of dried apples disappeared\r\nin a most astonishing and mysterious manner when left to cool. At\r\nlength I determined to watch them every second; and did so, with the\r\nresult that late one afternoon I was amazed to see a pie slowly rise\r\nfrom the table and move swiftly away through the air about four feet\r\nabove the ground, finally disappearing into a tangle of jasmine and\r\ngrape-vine.\r\n\r\n\"The apparently automatic flight of that pie solved the problem; these\r\ntransparent creatures cannot resist that delicacy. Therefore I decided\r\nto bait the cage for them this very night--Look! What's the matter\r\nwith that dog?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog suddenly bounded into the air, alighted on all fours, ears,\r\neyes, and muzzle concentrated on a point directly behind us.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! The pies!\" faltered Miss Barrison, half rising from\r\nher seat; but the dog rushed madly into her skirts, scrambling for\r\nprotection, and she fell back almost into my arms.\r\n\r\nClasping her tightly, I looked over my shoulder; the last pie was\r\nsnatched from the table before my eyes and I saw it borne swiftly away\r\nby something unseen, straight into the deepening shadows of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThe professor was singularly calm, even slightly ironical, as he\r\nturned to me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps if you relinquish Miss Barrison she may be able to free\r\nherself from that dog.\"\r\n\r\nI did so immediately, and she deposited the cowering dog in my arms.\r\nHer face had suddenly become pink.\r\n\r\nI passed the dog on to Professor Farrago, dumping it viciously into\r\nhis lap--a proceeding which struck me as resembling a pastime of\r\nextreme youth known as \"button, button, who's got the button?\"\r\n\r\nThe professor examined the animal gravely, feeling its pulse, counting\r\nits respirations, and finally inserting a tentative finger in an\r\nattempt to examine its tongue. The dog bit him.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch! It's a clear case of fright,\" he said, gravely. \"I wanted a dog\r\nto aid me in trailing these remarkable creatures, but I think this dog\r\nof yours is useless, Gilland.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's given us warning of the creatures' presence twice already,\" I\r\nargued.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little thing,\" said Miss Barrison, softly; \"I don't know why,\r\nbut I love that dog.... He has eyes like yours, Mr. Gilland--\"\r\n\r\nExasperated, I rose from the table. \"He's got eyes like holes burned\r\nin a blanket!\" I said. \"And if ever a flicker of intelligence lighted\r\nthem I have failed to observe it.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor regarded me dreamily. \"We ought to have more pies,\" he\r\nobserved. \"Perhaps if you carried the oven into the shanty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Miss Barrison; \"we can lock the door while I make\r\ntwelve more pies.\"\r\n\r\nI carried the portable camping-oven into the cabin, connected the\r\npatent asbestos chimney-pipes, and lighted the fire. And in a few\r\nminutes Miss Barrison, sleeves rolled up and pink apron pinned under\r\nher chin, was busily engaged in rolling pie-crust, while Professor\r\nFarrago measured out spices and set the dried apples to soak.\r\n\r\nThe swift Southern twilight had already veiled the forest as I\r\nstepped out of the cabin to smoke a cigar and promenade a bit and\r\ncogitate. A last trace of color lingering in the west faded out as I\r\nlooked; the gray glimmer deepened into darkness, through which the\r\nwhite lake vapors floated in thin, wavering strata across the water.\r\n\r\nFor a while the frog's symphony dominated all other sounds, then\r\nlagoon and forest and cypress branch awoke; and through the steadily\r\nsustained tumult of woodland voices I could hear the dry bark of the\r\nfox-squirrel, the whistle of the raccoon, ducks softly quacking or\r\nwhimpering as they prepared for sleep among the reeds, the soft\r\nbooming of bitterns, the clattering gossip of the heronry, the\r\nSouthern whippoorwill's incessant call.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals the howling note of a lone heron echoed the\r\nstrident screech of a crimson-crested crane; the horned owl's savage\r\nhunting-cry haunted the night, now near, now floating from infinite\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while I became aware of a nearer sound, low-pitched but\r\nceaseless--the hum of thousands of lesser living creatures blending to\r\na steady monotone.\r\n\r\nThen the theatrical moon came up through filmy draperies of waving\r\nSpanish moss thin as cobwebs; and far in the wilderness a cougar fell\r\na-crying and coughing like a little child with a bad cold.\r\n\r\nI went in after that. Miss Barrison was sitting before the oven, knees\r\ngathered in her clasped hands, languidly studying the fire. She looked\r\nup as I appeared, opened the oven-doors, sniffed the aroma, and\r\nresumed her attitude of contented indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the professor?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He has retired. He's been talking in his sleep at moments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better take it down; that's what you're here for,\" I observed,\r\nclosing and holding the outside door. \"Ugh! there's a chill in the\r\nair. The dew is pelting down from the pines like a steady fall of\r\nrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will get fever if you roam about at night,\" she said. \"Mercy!\r\nyour coat is soaking. Sit here by the fire.\"\r\n\r\nSo I pulled up a bench and sat down beside her like the traditional\r\nspider.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Muffitt,\" I said, \"don't let me frighten you away--\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going anyhow--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she demanded, reseating herself.\r\n\r\n\"Because I like to sit beside you,\" I said, truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Your avowal is startling and not to be substantiated by facts,\" she\r\nremarked, resting her chin on one hand and gazing into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"You mean because I went for a stroll by moonlight? I did that because\r\nyou always seem to make fun of me as soon as the professor joins us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make fun of you? You surely don't expect me to make eyes at you!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; I toasted my shins, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"How is your burned finger?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe lifted it for my inspection, and I began a protracted examination.\r\n\r\n\"What would you prescribe?\" she inquired, with an absent-minded glance\r\nat the professor's closed door.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; perhaps a slight but firm pressure of the\r\nfinger-tips--\"\r\n\r\n\"You tried that this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the dog interrupted us--\"\r\n\r\n\"Interrupted _you_. Besides--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you ought to,\" she said.\r\n\r\nSitting there before the oven, side by side, hand innocently clasped\r\nin hand, we heard the drumming of the dew on the roof, the night-wind\r\nstirring the palms, the muffled snoring of the professor, the faint\r\nwhisper and crackle of the fire.\r\n\r\nA single candle burned brightly, piling our shadows together on the\r\nwall behind us; moonlight silvered the window-panes, over which\r\ncrawled multitudes of soft-winged moths, attracted by the candle\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\"See their tiny eyes glow!\" she whispered. \"How their wings quiver!\r\nAnd all for a candle-flame! Alas! alas! fire is the undoing of us\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, resting as though buried in reverie. After a while\r\nshe extended one foot a trifle and, with the point of her shoe,\r\ncarefully unlatched the oven-door. As it swung outward a delicious\r\nfragrance filled the room.\r\n\r\n\"They're done,\" she said, withdrawing her hand from mine. \"Help me to\r\nlift them out.\"\r\n\r\nTogether we arranged the delicious pastry in rows on the bench to\r\ncool. I opened the door for a few minutes, then closed and bolted it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose those transparent creatures will smell the odor and\r\ncome around the cabin?\" she suggested, wiping her fingers on her\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nI walked to the window uneasily. Outside the pane the moths crawled,\r\nsome brilliant in scarlet and tan-color set with black, some\r\nsnow-white with black tracings on their wings, and bodies peacock-blue\r\nedged with orange. The scientist in me was aroused; I called her to\r\nthe window, and she came and leaned against the sill, nose pressed to\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose you know that the antennæ of that silvery-winged moth\r\nare distinctly pectinate,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" she said. \"I took my degree as D.E. at Barnard\r\nCollege.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed in astonishment. \"You've been through Barnard? You\r\nare a Doctor of Entomology?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my undoing,\" she said. \"The department was abolished the year\r\nI graduated. There was no similar vacancy, even in the Smithsonian.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, eyes fixed on the moths. \"I had to make my\r\nown living. I chose stenography as the quickest road to\r\nself-sustenance.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up, a flush on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you took me for an inferior?\" she said. \"But do you suppose\r\nI'd flirt with you if I was?\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed her face to the pane again, murmuring that exquisite poem\r\nof Andrew Lang:\r\n\r\n    \"Spooning is innocuous and needn't have a sequel,\r\n     But recollect, if spoon you must, spoon only with your equal.\"\r\n\r\nStanding there, watching the moths, we became rather silent--I don't\r\nknow why.\r\n\r\nThe fire in the range had gone out; the candle-flame, flaring above a\r\nsaucer of melted wax, sank lower and lower.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as though disturbed by something inside, the moths all left\r\nthe window-pane, darting off in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"That's curious,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What's curious?\" she asked, opening her eyes languidly. \"Good\r\ngracious! Was that a bat that beat on the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw nothing,\" I said, disturbed. \"Listen!\"\r\n\r\nA soft sound against the glass, as though invisible fingers were\r\nfeeling the pane--a gentle rubbing--then a tap-tap, all but inaudible.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a bird? Can you see?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nThe candle-flame behind us flashed and expired. Moonlight flooded the\r\npane. The sounds continued, but there was nothing there.\r\n\r\nWe understood now what it was that so gently rubbed and patted the\r\nglass outside. With one accord we noiselessly gathered up the pies and\r\ncarried them into my room.\r\n\r\nThen she walked to the door of her room, turned, held out her hand,\r\nand whispering, \"Good-night! A demain, monsieur!\" slipped into her\r\nroom and softly closed the door.\r\n\r\nAnd all night long I lay in troubled slumber beside the pies, a rifle\r\nresting on the blankets beside me, a revolver under my pillow. And I\r\ndreamed of moths with brilliant eyes and vast silvery wings harnessed\r\nto a balloon in which Miss Barrison and I sat, arms around each other,\r\neating slice after slice of apple-pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn came--the dawn of a day that I am destined never to forget. Long,\r\nrosy streamers of light broke through the forest, shaking, quivering,\r\nlike unstable beams from celestial search-lights. Mist floated upward\r\nfrom marsh and lake; and through it the spectral palms loomed,\r\ndrooping fronds embroidered with dew.\r\n\r\nFor a while the ringing outburst of bird music dominated all; but it\r\nsoon ceased with dropping notes from the crimson cardinals repeated in\r\nlengthening minor intervals; and then the spell of silence returned,\r\nbroken only by the faint splash of mullet, mocking the sun with\r\nsinuous, silver flashes.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning,\" said a low voice from the door as I stood encouraging\r\nthe camp-fire with splinter wood and dead palmetto fans.\r\n\r\nFresh and sweet from her toilet as a dew-drenched rose, Miss Barrison\r\nstood there sniffing the morning air daintily, thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Too much perfume,\" she said--\"too much like ylang-ylang in a\r\ndepartment-store. Central Park smells sweeter on an April morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you criticising the wild jasmine?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm criticising an exotic smell. Am I not permitted to comment on the\r\ntropics?\"\r\n\r\nFishing out a cedar log from the lumber-stack, I fell to chopping it\r\nvigorously. The axe-strokes made a cheerful racket through the woods.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear anything last night after you retired?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Something was at my window--something that thumped softly and seemed\r\nto be feeling all over the glass. To tell you the truth, I was silly\r\nenough to remain dressed all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look it,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, when daylight came I had a chance,\" she added, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said I, leaning on the axe and watching her, \"you are\r\nabout the coolest and pluckiest woman I ever knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were all in the same fix,\" she said, modestly.\r\n\r\n\"No, we were not. Now I'll tell you the truth--my hair stood up the\r\ngreater part of the night. You are looking upon a poltroon, Miss\r\nBarrison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there was something at your window, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something? A dozen! They were monkeying with the sashes and panes all\r\nnight long, and I imagined that I could hear them breathing--as though\r\nfrom effort of intense eagerness. Ouch! I came as near losing my nerve\r\nas I care to. I came within an ace of hurling those cursed pies\r\nthrough the window at them. I'd bolt to-day if I wasn't afraid to play\r\nthe coward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most people are brave for that reason,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe dog, who had slept under my bunk, and who had contributed to my\r\nentertainment by sighing and moaning all night, now appeared ready for\r\nbusiness--business in his case being the operation of feeding. I\r\npresented him with a concentrated tablet, which he cautiously\r\ninvestigated and then rolled on.\r\n\r\n\"Nice testimonial for the people who concocted it,\" I said, in\r\ndisgust. \"I wish I had an egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some concentrated egg tablets in the shanty,\" said Miss\r\nBarrison; but the idea was not attractive.\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to fry a pill for breakfast,\" I said, sullenly, and set the\r\ncoffee-pot on the coals.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dewy beauty of the morning, breakfast was not a\r\ncheerful function. Professor Farrago appeared, clad in sun-helmet and\r\nkhaki. I had seldom seen him depressed; but he was now, and his very\r\nefforts to disguise it only emphasized his visible anxiety.\r\n\r\nHis preparations for the day, too, had an ominous aspect to me. He\r\ngave his orders and we obeyed, instinctively suppressing questions.\r\nFirst, he and I transported all personal luggage of the company to the\r\nbig electric launch--Miss Barrison's effects, his, and my own. His\r\nprivate papers, the stenographic reports, and all memoranda were tied\r\nup together and carried aboard.\r\n\r\nThen, to my surprise, two weeks' concentrated rations for two and\r\nmineral water sufficient for the same period were stowed away aboard\r\nthe launch. Several times he asked me whether I knew how to run the\r\nboat, and I assured him that I did.\r\n\r\nIn a short time nothing was left ashore except the bare furnishings of\r\nthe cabin, the female wearing-apparel, the steel cage and chemicals\r\nwhich I had brought, and the twelve apple-pies--the latter under lock\r\nand key in my room.\r\n\r\nAs the preparations came to an end, the professor's gentle melancholy\r\nseemed to deepen. Once I ventured to ask him if he was indisposed, and\r\nhe replied that he had never felt in better physical condition.\r\n\r\nPresently he bade me fetch the pies; and I brought them, and, at a\r\nsign from him, placed them inside the steel cage, closing and locking\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" he said, glancing from Miss Barrison to me, and from me\r\nto the dog--\"I believe that we are ready to start.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the cabin and locked the door on the outside, pocketing the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nThen he backed up to the steel cage, stooped and lifted his end as I\r\nlifted mine, and together we started off through the forest, bearing\r\nthe cage between us as porters carry a heavy piece of luggage.\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison came next, carrying the trousseau, the tank, hose, and\r\nchemicals; and the dog followed her--probably not from affection for\r\nus, but because he was afraid to be left alone.\r\n\r\nWe walked in silence, the professor and I keeping an instinctive\r\nlookout for snakes; but we encountered nothing of that sort. On every\r\nside, touching our shoulders, crowded the closely woven and\r\nimpenetrable tangle of the jungle; and we threaded it along a narrow\r\npath which he, no doubt, had cut, for the machete marks were still\r\nfresh, and the blazes on hickory, live-oak, and palm were all wet with\r\ndripping sap, and swarming with eager, brilliant butterflies.\r\n\r\nAt times across our course flowed shallow, rapid streams of water,\r\nclear as crystal, and most alluring to the thirsty.\r\n\r\n\"There's fever in every drop,\" said the professor, as I mentioned my\r\nthirst; \"take the bottled water if you mean to stay a little longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"On earth,\" he replied, tersely; and we marched on.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the tropics is marred somewhat for me; under all the\r\nfresh splendor of color death lurks in brilliant tints. Where painted\r\nfruit hangs temptingly, where great, silky blossoms exhale alluring\r\nscent, where the elaps coils inlaid with scarlet, black, and saffron,\r\nwhere in the shadow of a palmetto frond a succession of velvety black\r\ndiamonds mark the rattler's swollen length, there death is; and his\r\ninvisible consort, horror, creeps where the snake whose mouth is lined\r\nwith white creeps--where the tarantula squats, hairy, motionless;\r\nwhere a bit of living enamel fringed with orange undulates along a\r\nmossy log.\r\n\r\nThinking of these things, and watchful lest, unawares, terror unfold\r\nfrom some blossoming and leafy covert, I scarcely noticed the beauty\r\nof the glade we had entered--a long oval, cross-barred with sunshine\r\nwhich fell on hedges of scrub-palmetto, chin high, interlaced with\r\ngolden blossoms of the jasmine. And all around, like pillars\r\nsupporting a high green canopy above a throne, towered the silvery\r\nstems of palms fretted with pale, rose-tinted lichens and hung with\r\ndraperies of grape-vine.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place,\" said Professor Farrago.\r\n\r\nHis quiet, passionless voice sounded strange to me; his words seemed\r\nstrange, too, each one heavily weighted with hidden meaning.\r\n\r\nWe set the cage on the ground; he unlocked and opened the steel-barred\r\ndoor, and, kneeling, carefully arranged the pies along the centre of\r\nthe cage.\r\n\r\n\"I have a curious presentiment,\" he said, \"that I shall not come out\r\nof this experiment unscathed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, for Heaven's sake, say that!\" I broke out, my nerves on edge\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he asked, surprised. \"I am not afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not afraid to die?\" I demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\n\"Who spoke of dying?\" he inquired, mildly. \"What I said was that I do\r\nnot expect to come out of this affair unscathed.\"\r\n\r\nI did not comprehend his meaning, but I understood the reproof\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\nHe closed and locked the cage door again and came towards us,\r\nbalancing the key across the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\nMiss Barrison had seated herself on the leaves; I stood back as the\r\nprofessor sat down beside her; then, at a gesture from him, took the\r\nplace he indicated on his left.\r\n\r\n\"Before we begin,\" he said, calmly, \"there are several things you\r\nought to know and which I have not yet told you. The first concerns\r\nthe feminine wearing apparel which Mr. Gilland brought me.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Miss Barrison and asked her whether she had brought a\r\ncomplete outfit, and she opened the bundle on her knees and handed it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" he said, \"delicately explain in so many words what use I\r\nexpect to make of this apparel. Nor do I yet know whether I shall have\r\nany use at all for it. That can only be a theoretical speculation\r\nuntil, within a few more hours, my theory is proven or disproven--and,\"\r\nhe said, suddenly turning on me, \"my theory concerning these invisible\r\ncreatures is the most extraordinary and audacious theory ever\r\nentertained by man since Columbus presumed that there must lie\r\nsomewhere a hidden continent which nobody had ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand over his protruding forehead, lost for a moment in\r\ndeepest reflection. Then, \"Have you ever heard of the Sphyx?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that Ponce de Leon wrote of something--\" I began,\r\nhesitating.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the famous lines in the third volume which have set so many wise\r\nmen guessing. You recall them:\r\n\r\n\"'_And there, alas! within sound of the Fountain of Youth whose waters\r\ntint the skin till the whole body glows softly like the petal of a\r\nrose--there, alas! in the new world already blooming_, THE ETERNAL\r\nENIGMA _I beheld, in the flesh living; yet it faded even as I looked,\r\nalthough I swear it lived and breathed. This is the Sphyx_.'\"\r\n\r\nA silence; then I said, \"Those lines are meaningless to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to me,\" said Miss Barrison, softly.\r\n\r\nThe professor looked at her. \"Ah, child! Ever subtler, ever surer--the\r\nEternal Enigma is no enigma to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the Sphyx?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Have you read De Soto? Or Goya?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, both. I remember now that De Soto records the Syachas legend of\r\nthe Sphyx--something about a goddess--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a goddess,\" said Miss Barrison, her lips touched with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said the professor, gently. \"And Goya said:\r\n\r\n\"'_It has come to my ears while in the lands of the Syachas that the\r\nSphyx surely lives, as bolder and more curious men than I may, God\r\nwilling, prove to the world hereafter_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the Sphyx?\" I insisted.\r\n\r\n\"For centuries wise men and savants have asked each other that\r\nquestion. I have answered it for myself; I am now to prove it, I\r\ntrust.\"\r\n\r\nHis face darkened, and again and again he stroked his heavy brow.\r\n\r\n\"If anything occurs,\" he said, taking my hand in his left and Miss\r\nBarrison's hand in his right, \"promise me to obey my wishes. Will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" we said, together.\r\n\r\n\"If I lose my life, or--or disappear, promise me on your honor to get\r\nto the electric launch as soon as possible and make all speed\r\nnorthward, placing my private papers, the reports of Miss Barrison,\r\nand your own reports in the hands of the authorities in Bronx Park.\r\nDon't attempt to aid me; don't delay to search for me. Do you\r\npromise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" we breathed together.\r\n\r\nHe looked at us solemnly. \"If you fail me, you betray me,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe swore obedience.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us begin,\" he said, and he rose and went to the steel cage.\r\nUnlocking the door, he flung it wide and stepped inside, leaving the\r\ncage door open.\r\n\r\n\"The moment a single pie is disturbed,\" he said to me, \"I shall close\r\nthe steel door from the inside, and you and Miss Barrison will then\r\ndump the rosium oxide and the strontium into the tank, clap on the\r\nlid, turn the nozzle of the hose on the cage, and spray it\r\nthoroughly. Whatever is invisible in the cage will become visible and\r\nof a faint rose color. And when the trapped creature becomes visible,\r\nhold yourselves ready to aid me as long as I am able to give you\r\norders. After that either all will go well or all will go otherwise,\r\nand you must run for the launch.\" He seated himself in the cage near\r\nthe open door.\r\n\r\nI placed the steel tank near the cage, uncoiled the hose attachment,\r\nunscrewed the top, and dumped in the salts of strontium. Miss Barrison\r\nunwrapped the bottle of rosium oxide and loosened the cork. We\r\nexamined this pearl-and-pink powder and shook it up so that it might\r\nrun out quickly. Then Miss Barrison sat down, and presently became\r\nabsorbed in a stenographic report of the proceedings up to date.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Barrison finished her report she handed me the bundle of\r\npapers. I stowed them away in my wallet, and we sat down together\r\nbeside the tank.\r\n\r\nInside the cage Professor Farrago was seated, his spectacled eyes\r\nfixed on the row of pies. For a while, although realizing perfectly\r\nthat our quarry was transparent and invisible, we unconsciously\r\nstrained our eyes in quest of something stirring in the forest.\r\n\r\n\"I should think,\" said I, in a low voice, \"that the odor of the pies\r\nmight draw at least one out of the odd dozen that came rubbing up\r\nagainst my window last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Listen!\" she breathed. But we heard nothing save the snoring of\r\nthe overfed dog at our feet.\r\n\r\n\"He'll give us ample notice by butting into Miss Barrison's skirts,\" I\r\nobserved. \"No need of our watching, professor.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor nodded. Presently he removed his spectacles and lay back\r\nagainst the bars, closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first the forest silence seemed cheerful there in the flecked\r\nsunlight. The spotted wood-gnats gyrated merrily, chased by\r\ndragon-flies; the shy wood-birds hopped from branch to twig, peering\r\nat us in friendly inquiry; a lithe, gray squirrel, plumy tail\r\nundulating, rambled serenely around the cage, sniffing at the pastry\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without apparent reason, the squirrel sprang to a\r\ntree-trunk, hung a moment on the bark, quivering all over, then dashed\r\naway into the jungle.\r\n\r\n\"Why did he act like that?\" whispered Miss Barrison. And, after a\r\nmoment: \"How still it is! Where have the birds gone?\"\r\n\r\nIn the ominous silence the dog began to whimper in his sleep and his\r\nhind legs kicked convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"He's dreaming--\" I began.\r\n\r\nThe words were almost driven down my throat by the dog, who, without a\r\nyelp of warning, hurled himself at Miss Barrison and alighted on my\r\nchest, fore paws around my neck.\r\n\r\nI cast him scornfully from me, but he scrambled back, digging like a\r\nmole to get under us.\r\n\r\n\"The transparent creatures!\" whispered Miss Barrison. \"Look! See that\r\npie move!\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet just as the professor, jamming on his spectacles,\r\nleaned forward and slammed the cage door.\r\n\r\n\"I've got one!\" he shouted, frantically. \"There's one in the cage!\r\nTurn on that hose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a second,\" said Miss Barrison, calmly, uncorking the bottle and\r\npouring a pearly stream of rosium oxide into the tank. \"Quick! It's\r\nfizzing! Screw on the top!\"\r\n\r\nIn a second I had screwed the top fast, seized the hose, and directed\r\na hissing cloud of vapor through the cage bars.\r\n\r\nFor a moment nothing was heard save the whistling rush of the perfumed\r\nspray escaping; a delicious odor of roses filled the air. Then,\r\nslowly, there in the sunshine, a misty something grew in the cage--a\r\nglistening, pearl-tinted phantom, imperceptibly taking shape in\r\nspace--vague at first as a shred of lake vapor, then lengthening,\r\nrounding into flowing form, clearer, clearer.\r\n\r\n\"The Sphyx!\" gasped the professor. \"In the name of Heaven, play that\r\nhose!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the treacherous hose burst. A showery pillar of\r\nrose-colored vapor enveloped everything. Through the thickening fog\r\nfor one brief instant a human form appeared like magic--a woman's\r\nform, flawless, exquisite as a statue, pure as marble. Then the\r\nswimming vapor buried it, cage, pies, and all.\r\n\r\nWe ran frantically around, the cage in the obscurity, appealing for\r\ninstructions and feeling for the bars. Once the professor's muffled\r\nvoice was heard demanding the wearing apparel, and I groped about and\r\nfound it and stuffed it through the bars of the cage.\r\n\r\n\"Do you need help?\" I shouted. There was no response. Staring around\r\nthrough the thickening vapor of rosium rolling in clouds from the\r\noverturned tank, I heard Miss Barrison's voice calling:\r\n\r\n\"I can't move! A transparent lady is holding me!\"\r\n\r\nBlindly I rushed about, arms outstretched, and the next moment struck\r\nthe door of the cage so hard that the impact almost knocked me\r\nsenseless. Clutching it to steady myself, it suddenly flew open. A\r\nrush of partly visible creatures passed me like a burst of pink\r\nflames, and in the midst, borne swiftly away on the crest of the\r\noutrush, the professor passed like a bolt shot from a catapult; and\r\nhis last cry came wafted back to me from the forest as I swayed there,\r\ndrunk with the stupefying perfume: \"Don't worry! I'm all right!\"\r\n\r\nI staggered out into the clearer air towards a figure seen dimly\r\nthrough swirling vapor.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" I stammered, clasping Miss Barrison in my arms.\r\n\r\n\"No--oh no,\" she said, wringing her hands. \"But the professor! I saw\r\nhim! I could not scream; I could not move! _They_ had him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him too,\" I groaned. \"There was not one trace of terror on his\r\nface. He was actually smiling.\"\r\n\r\nOvercome at the sublime courage of the man, we wept in each other's\r\narms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrue to our promise to Professor Farrago, we made the best of our way\r\nnorthward; and it was not a difficult journey by any means, the voyage\r\nin the launch across Okeechobee being perfectly simple and the trail\r\nto the nearest railroad station but a few easy miles from the\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nShocking as had been our experience, dreadful as was the calamity\r\nwhich had not only robbed me of a life-long friend, but had also\r\nbereaved the entire scientific world, I could not seem to feel that\r\ndesperate and hopeless grief which the natural decease of a close\r\nfriend might warrant. No; there remained a vague expectancy which so\r\ndominated my sorrow that at moments I became hopeful--nay, sanguine,\r\nthat I should one day again behold my beloved superior in the flesh.\r\nThere was something so happy in his last smile, something so artlessly\r\npleased, that I was certain no fear of impending dissolution worried\r\nhim as he disappeared into the uncharted depth of the unknown\r\nEverglades.\r\n\r\nI think Miss Barrison agreed with me, too. She appeared to be more or\r\nless dazed, which was, of course, quite natural; and during our return\r\nvoyage across Okeechobee and through the lagoons and forests beyond\r\nshe was very silent.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the railroad at Portulacca, a thrifty lemon-growing\r\nranch on the Volusia and Chinkapin Railway, the first thing I did was\r\nto present my dog to the station-agent--but I was obliged to give him\r\nfive dollars before he consented to accept the dog.\r\n\r\nHowever, Miss Barrison interviewed the station-master's wife, a\r\nkindly, pitiful soul, who promised to be a good mistress to the\r\ncreature. We both felt better after that was off our minds; we felt\r\nbetter still when the north-bound train rolled leisurely into the\r\nwhite glare of Portulacca, and presently rolled out again, quite as\r\nleisurely, bound, thank Heaven, for that abused aggregation of sinful\r\nboroughs called New York.\r\n\r\nExcept for one young man whom I encountered in the smoker, we had the\r\ntrain to ourselves, a circumstance which, curiously enough, appeared\r\nto increase Miss Barrison's depression, and my own as a natural\r\nsequence. The circumstances of the taking off of Professor Farrago\r\nappeared to engross her thoughts so completely that it made me uneasy\r\nduring our trip out from Little Sprite--in fact it was growing plainer\r\nto me every hour that in her brief acquaintance with that\r\ndistinguished scientist she had become personally attached to him to\r\nan extent that began to worry me. Her personal indignation at the\r\ncaged Sphyx flared out at unexpected intervals, and there could be no\r\ndoubt that her unhappiness and resentment were becoming morbid.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour or two in the smoking compartment, tenanted only by a\r\nsingle passenger and myself. He was an agreeable young man, although,\r\nin the natural acquaintanceship that we struck up, I regretted to\r\nlearn that he was a writer of popular fiction, returning from Fort\r\nWorth, where he had been for the sole purpose of composing a poem on\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nI have always, in common with other mentally balanced savants,\r\ndespised writers of fiction. All scientists harbor a natural antipathy\r\nto romance in any form, and that antipathy becomes a deep horror if\r\nfiction dares to deal flippantly with the exact sciences, or if some\r\ndegraded intellect assumes the warrantless liberty of using natural\r\nhistory as the vehicle for silly tales.\r\n\r\nNever but once had I been tempted to romance in any form; never but\r\nonce had sentiment interfered with a passionless transfer of\r\nscientific notes to the sanctuary of the unvarnished note-book or the\r\ncloister of the juiceless monograph. Nor have I the slightest approach\r\nto that superficial and doubtful quality known as literary skill.\r\nOnce, however, as I sat alone in the middle of the floor, classifying\r\nmy isopods, I was not only astonished but totally unprepared to find\r\nmyself repeating aloud a verse that I myself had unconsciously\r\nfashioned:\r\n\r\n    \"An isopod\r\n     Is a work of God.\"\r\n\r\nNever before in all my life had I made a rhyme; and it worried me for\r\nweeks, ringing in my brain day and night, confusing me, interfering\r\nwith my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI said as much to the young man, who only laughed good-naturedly and\r\nreplied that it was the Creator's purpose to limit certain intellects,\r\nnobody knows why, and that it was apparent that mine had not escaped.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing, however,\" he said, \"that might be of some interest\r\nto you and come within the circumscribed scope of your intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\" I asked, tartly.\r\n\r\n\"A scientific experience of mine,\" he said, with a careless laugh.\r\n\"It's so much stranger than fiction that even Professor Bruce\r\nStoddard, of Columbia, hesitated to credit it.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the young fellow suspiciously. His bland smile disarmed\r\nme, but I did not invite him to relate his experience, although he\r\napparently needed only that encouragement to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if I could tell it exactly as it occurred,\" he observed, \"and a\r\nstenographer could take it down, word for word, exactly as I relate\r\nit--\"\r\n\r\n\"It would give me great pleasure to do so,\" said a quiet voice at the\r\ndoor. We rose at once, removing the cigars from our lips; but Miss\r\nBarrison bade us continue smoking, and at a gesture from her we\r\nresumed our seats after she had installed herself by the window.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" she said, looking coldly at me, \"I couldn't endure the\r\nsolitude any longer. Isn't there anything to do on this tiresome\r\ntrain?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had your pad and pencil,\" I began, maliciously, \"you might\r\ntake down a matter of interest--\"\r\n\r\nShe looked frankly at the young man, who laughed in that pleasant,\r\ngood-tempered manner of his, and offered to tell us of his alleged\r\nscientific experience if we thought it might amuse us sufficiently to\r\nvary the dull monotony of the journey north.\r\n\r\n\"Is it fiction?\" I asked, point-blank.\r\n\r\n\"It is absolute truth,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nI rose and went off to find pad and pencil. When I returned Miss\r\nBarrison was laughing at a story which the young man had just\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he ended, gravely, \"I have practically decided to renounce\r\nfiction as a means of livelihood and confine myself to simple,\r\nuninteresting statistics and facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to hear you say that,\" I exclaimed, warmly. He bowed,\r\nlooked at Miss Barrison, and asked her when he might begin his story.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever you are ready,\" replied Miss Barrison, smiling in a manner\r\nwhich I had not observed since the disappearance of Professor Farrago.\r\nI'll admit that the young fellow was superficially attractive.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" he began, modestly, \"having no technical ability\r\nconcerning the affair in question, and having no knowledge of either\r\ncomparative anatomy or zoology, I am perhaps unfitted to tell this\r\nstory. But the story is true; the episode occurred under my own\r\neyes--within a few hours' sail of the Battery. And as I was one of the\r\nfirst persons to verify what has long been a theory among scientists,\r\nand, moreover, as the result of Professor Holroyd's discovery is to\r\nbe placed on exhibition in Madison Square Garden on the 20th of next\r\nmonth, I have decided to tell you, as simply as I am able, exactly\r\nwhat occurred.\r\n\r\n\"I first told the story on April 1, 1903, to the editors of the _North\r\nAmerican Review_, _The Popular Science Monthly_, the _Scientific\r\nAmerican_, _Nature_, _Outing_, and the _Fossiliferous Magazine_. All\r\nthese gentlemen rejected it; some curtly informing me that fiction had\r\nno place in their columns. When I attempted to explain that it was not\r\nfiction, the editors of these periodicals either maintained a\r\ncontemptuous silence, or bluntly notified me that my literary services\r\nand opinions were not desired. But finally, when several publishers\r\noffered to take the story as fiction, I cut short all negotiations and\r\ndecided to publish it myself. Where I am known at all, it is my\r\nmisfortune to be known as a writer of fiction. This makes it\r\nimpossible for me to receive a hearing from a scientific audience. I\r\nregret it bitterly, because now, when it is too late, I am prepared to\r\nprove certain scientific matters of interest, and to produce the\r\nproofs. In this case, however, I am fortunate, for nobody can dispute\r\nthe existence of a thing when the bodily proof is exhibited as\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\"This is the story; and if I tell it as I write fiction, it is because\r\nI do not know how to tell it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"I was walking along the beach below Pine Inlet, on the south shore of\r\nLong Island. The railroad and telegraph station is at West Oyster Bay.\r\nEverybody who has travelled on the Long Island Railroad knows the\r\nstation, but few, perhaps, know Pine Inlet. Duck-shooters, of course,\r\nare familiar with it; but as there are no hotels there, and nothing\r\nto see except salt meadow, salt creek, and a strip of dune and sand,\r\nthe summer-squatting public may probably be unaware of its existence.\r\nThe local name for the place is Pine Inlet; the maps give its name as\r\nSand Point, I believe, but anybody at West Oyster Bay can direct you\r\nto it. Captain McPeek, who keeps the West Oyster Bay House, drives\r\nduck-shooters there in winter. It lies five miles southeast from West\r\nOyster Bay.\r\n\r\n\"I had walked over that afternoon from Captain McPeek's. There was a\r\nreason for my going to Pine Inlet--it embarrasses me to explain it,\r\nbut the truth is I meditated writing an ode to the ocean. It was out\r\nof the question to write it in West Oyster Bay, with the whistle of\r\nlocomotives in my ears. I knew that Pine Inlet was one of the\r\nloneliest places on the Atlantic coast; it is out of sight of\r\neverything except leagues of gray ocean. Rarely one might make out\r\nfishing-smacks drifting across the horizon. Summer squatters never\r\nvisited it; sportsmen shunned it, except in winter. Therefore, as I\r\nwas about to do a bit of poetry, I thought that Pine Inlet was the\r\nspot for the deed. So I went there.\r\n\r\n\"As I was strolling along the beach, biting my pencil reflectively,\r\ntremendously impressed by the solitude and the solemn thunder of the\r\nsurf, a thought occurred to me--how unpleasant it would be if I\r\nsuddenly stumbled on a summer boarder. As this joyless impossibility\r\nflitted across my mind, I rounded a bleak sand-dune.\r\n\r\n\"A girl stood directly in my path.\r\n\r\n\"She stared at me as though I had just crawled up out of the sea to\r\nbite her. I don't know what my own expression resembled, but I have\r\nbeen given to understand it was idiotic.\r\n\r\n\"Now I perceived, after a few moments, that the young lady was\r\nfrightened, and I knew I ought to say something civil. So I said, 'Are\r\nthere many mosquitoes here?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' she replied, with a slight quiver in her voice; 'I have only\r\nseen one, and it was biting somebody else.'\r\n\r\n\"The conversation seemed so futile, and the young lady appeared to be\r\nmore nervous than before. I had an impulse to say, 'Do not run; I have\r\nbreakfasted,' for she seemed to be meditating a flight into the\r\nbreakers. What I did say was: 'I did not know anybody was here. I do\r\nnot intend to intrude. I come from Captain McPeek's, and I am writing\r\nan ode to the ocean.' After I had said this it seemed to ring in my\r\nears like, 'I come from Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful\r\nJames.'\r\n\r\n\"I glanced timidly at her.\r\n\r\n\"'She's thinking of the same thing,' said I to myself.\r\n\r\n\"However, the young lady seemed to be a trifle reassured. I noticed\r\nshe drew a sigh of relief and looked at my shoes. She looked so long\r\nthat it made me suspicious, and I also examined my shoes. They seemed\r\nto be in a fair state of repair.\r\n\r\n\"'I--I am sorry,' she said, 'but would you mind not walking on the\r\nbeach?'\r\n\r\n\"This was sudden. I had intended to retire and leave the beach to her,\r\nbut I did not fancy being driven away so abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"'Dear me!' she cried; 'you don't understand. I do not--I would not\r\nthink for a moment of asking you to leave Pine Inlet. I merely\r\nventured to request you to walk on the dunes. I am so afraid that your\r\nfootprints may obliterate the impressions that my father is studying.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' said I, looking about me as though I had been caught in the\r\nmiddle of a flower-bed; 'really I did not notice any impressions.\r\nImpressions of what?'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't know,' she said, smiling a little at my awkward pose. 'If\r\nyou step this way in a straight line you can do no damage.'\r\n\r\n\"I did as she bade me. I suppose my movements resembled the gait of a\r\nwet peacock. Possibly they recalled the delicate manoeuvres of the\r\nkangaroo. Anyway, she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"This seriously annoyed me. I had been at a disadvantage; I walk well\r\nenough when let alone.\r\n\r\n\"'You can scarcely expect,' said I, 'that a man absorbed in his own\r\nideas could notice impressions on the sand. I trust I have obliterated\r\nnothing.'\r\n\r\n\"As I said this I looked back at the long line of footprints\r\nstretching away in prospective across the sand. They were my own. How\r\nlarge they looked! Was that what she was laughing at?\r\n\r\n\"'I wish to explain,' she said, gravely, looking at the point of her\r\nparasol. 'I am very sorry to be obliged to warn you--to ask you to\r\nforego the pleasure of strolling on a beach that does not belong to\r\nme. Perhaps,' she continued, in sudden alarm, 'perhaps this beach\r\nbelongs to you?'\r\n\r\n\"'The beach? Oh no,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'But--but you were going to write poems about it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Only one--and that does not necessitate owning the beach. I have\r\nobserved,' said I, frankly, 'that the people who own nothing write\r\nmany poems about it.'\r\n\r\n\"She looked at me seriously.\r\n\r\n\"'I write many poems,' I added.\r\n\r\n\"She laughed doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"'Would you rather I went away?' I asked, politely. 'My family is\r\nrespectable,' I added; and I told her my name.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh! Then you wrote _Culled Cowslips_ and _Faded Fig-Leaves_ and you\r\nimitate Maeterlinck, and you--Oh, I know lots of people that you\r\nknow;' she cried, with every symptom of relief; 'and you know my\r\nbrother.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am the author,' said I, coldly, 'of _Culled Cowslips_, but _Faded\r\nFig-Leaves_ was an earlier work, which I no longer recognize, and I\r\nshould be grateful to you if you would be kind enough to deny that I\r\never imitated Maeterlinck. Possibly,' I added, 'he imitates me.'\r\n\r\n\"She was very quiet, and I saw she was sorry.\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind,' I said, magnanimously, 'you probably are not familiar\r\nwith modern literature. If I knew your name I should ask permission to\r\npresent myself.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, I am Daisy Holroyd,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'What! Jack Holroyd's little sister?'\r\n\r\n\"'Little?' she cried.\r\n\r\n\"'I didn't mean that,' said I. 'You know that your brother and I were\r\ngreat friends in Paris--'\r\n\r\n\"'I know,' she said, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"'Ahem! Of course,' I said, 'Jack and I were inseparable--'\r\n\r\n\"'Except when shut in separate cells,' said Miss Holroyd, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"This unfeeling allusion to the unfortunate termination of a\r\nLatin-Quarter celebration hurt me.\r\n\r\n\"'The police,' said I, 'were too officious.'\r\n\r\n\"'So Jack says,' replied Miss Holroyd, demurely.\r\n\r\n\"We had unconsciously moved on along the sand-hills, side by side, as\r\nwe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"'To think,' I repeated, 'that I should meet Jack's little--'\r\n\r\n\"'Please,' she said, 'you are only three years my senior.'\r\n\r\n\"She opened the sunshade and tipped it over one shoulder. It was\r\nwhite, and had spots and posies on it.\r\n\r\n\"'Jack sends us every new book you write,' she observed. 'I do not\r\napprove of some things you write.'\r\n\r\n\"'Modern school,' I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"'That is no excuse,' she said, severely; 'Anthony Trollope didn't do\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"The foam spume from the breakers was drifting across the dunes, and\r\nthe little tip-up snipe ran along the beach and teetered and whistled\r\nand spread their white-barred wings for a low, straight flight across\r\nthe shingle, only to tip and run and sail on again. The salt sea-wind\r\nwhistled and curled through the crested waves, blowing in perfumed\r\npuffs across thickets of sweet bay and cedar. As we passed through the\r\ncrackling juicy-stemmed marsh-weed myriads of fiddler crabs raised\r\ntheir fore-claws in warning and backed away, rustling, through the\r\nreeds, aggressive, protesting.\r\n\r\n\"'Like millions of pygmy Ajaxes defying the lightning,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Holroyd laughed.\r\n\r\n\"'Now I never imagined that authors were clever except in print,' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"She was a most extraordinary girl.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose,' she observed, after a moment's silence--'I suppose I am\r\ntaking you to my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'Delighted!' I mumbled. 'H'm! I had the honor of meeting Professor\r\nHolroyd in Paris.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; he bailed you and Jack out,' said Miss Holroyd, serenely.\r\n\r\n\"The silence was too painful to last.\r\n\r\n\"'Captain McPeek is an interesting man,' I said. I spoke more loudly\r\nthan I intended. I may have been nervous.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'but he has a most singular hotel clerk.'\r\n\r\n\"'You mean Mr. Frisby?'\r\n\r\n\"'I do.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I admitted, 'Mr. Frisby is queer. He was once a bill-poster.'\r\n\r\n\"'I know it!' exclaimed Daisy Holroyd, with some heat. 'He ruins\r\nlandscapes whenever he has an opportunity. Do you know that he has a\r\npassion for bill-posting? He has; he posts bills for the pure pleasure\r\nof it, just as you play golf, or tennis, or squash.'\r\n\r\n\"'But he's a hotel clerk now,' I said; 'nobody employs him to post\r\nbills.'\r\n\r\n\"'I know it! He does it all by himself for the pure pleasure of it.\r\nPapa has engaged him to come down here for two weeks, and I dread it,'\r\nsaid the girl.\r\n\r\n\"What Professor Holroyd might want of Frisby I had not the faintest\r\nnotion. I suppose Miss Holroyd noticed the bewilderment in my face,\r\nfor she laughed and nodded her head twice.\r\n\r\n\"'Not only Mr. Frisby, but Captain McPeek also,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't mean to say that Captain McPeek is going to close his\r\nhotel!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"My trunk was there. It contained guarantees of my respectability.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh no; his wife will keep it open,' replied the girl. 'Look! you can\r\nsee papa now. He's digging.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where?' I blurted out.\r\n\r\n\"I remembered Professor Holroyd as a prim, spectacled gentleman, with\r\nclose-cut, snowy beard and a clerical allure. The man I saw digging\r\nwore green goggles, a jersey, a battered sou'wester, and hip-boots of\r\nrubber. He was delving in the muck of the salt meadow, his face\r\nstreaming with perspiration, his boots and jersey splashed with\r\nunpleasant-looking mud. He glanced up as we approached, shading his\r\neyes with a sunburned hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Papa, dear,' said Miss Holroyd, 'here is Jack's friend, whom you\r\nbailed out of Mazas.'\r\n\r\n\"The introduction was startling. I turned crimson with mortification.\r\nThe professor was very decent about it; he called me by name at once.\r\nThen he looked at his spade. It was clear he considered me a nuisance\r\nand wished to go on with his digging.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose,' he said, 'you are still writing?'\r\n\r\n\"'A little,' I replied, trying not to speak sarcastically. My output\r\nhad rivalled that of 'The Duchess'--in quantity, I mean.\r\n\r\n\"'I seldom read--fiction,' he said, looking restlessly at the hole in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Holroyd came to my rescue.\r\n\r\n\"'That was a charming story you wrote last,' she said. 'Papa should\r\nread it--you should, papa; it's all about a fossil.'\r\n\r\n\"We both looked narrowly at Miss Holroyd. Her smile was guileless.\r\n\r\n\"'Fossils!' repeated the professor. 'Do you care for fossils?'\r\n\r\n\"'Very much,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am not perfectly sure what my object was in lying. I looked at\r\nDaisy Holroyd's dark-fringed eyes. They were very grave.\r\n\r\n\"'Fossils,' said I, 'are my hobby.'\r\n\r\n\"I think Miss Holroyd winced a little at this. I did not care. I went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\"'I have seldom had the opportunity to study the subject, but, as a\r\nboy, I collected flint arrow-heads--\"\r\n\r\n\"'Flint arrow-heads!' said the professor coldly.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; they were the nearest things to fossils obtainable,' I replied,\r\nmarvelling at my own mendacity.\r\n\r\n\"The professor looked into the hole. I also looked. I could see\r\nnothing in it. 'He's digging for fossils,' thought I to myself.\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps,' said the professor, cautiously, 'you might wish to aid me\r\nin a little research--that is to say, if you have an inclination for\r\nfossils.' The double-entendre was not lost upon me.\r\n\r\n\"'I have read all your books so eagerly,' said I, 'that to join you,\r\nto be of service to you in any research, however difficult and\r\ntrying, would be an honor and a privilege that I never dared to hope\r\nfor.'\r\n\r\n\"'That,' thought I to myself, 'will do its own work.'\r\n\r\n\"But the professor was still suspicious. How could he help it, when he\r\nremembered Jack's escapades, in which my name was always blended!\r\nDoubtless he was satisfied that my influence on Jack was evil. The\r\ncontrary was the case, too.\r\n\r\n\"'Fossils,' he said, worrying the edge of the excavation with his\r\nspade--'fossils are not things to be lightly considered.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, indeed!' I protested.\r\n\r\n\"'Fossils are the most interesting as well as puzzling things in the\r\nworld,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'They are!' I cried, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"'But I am not looking for fossils,' observed the professor, mildly.\r\n\r\n\"This was a facer. I looked at Daisy Holroyd. She bit her lip and\r\nfixed her eyes on the sea. Her eyes were wonderful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Did you think I was digging for fossils in a salt meadow?' queried\r\nthe professor. 'You can have read very little about the subject. I am\r\ndigging for something quite different.'\r\n\r\n\"I was silent. I knew that my face was flushed. I longed to say,\r\n'Well, what the devil are you digging for?' but I only stared into the\r\nhole as though hypnotized.\r\n\r\n\"'Captain McPeek and Frisby ought to be here,' he said, looking first\r\nat Daisy and then across the meadows.\r\n\r\n\"I ached to ask him why he had subpoenaed Captain McPeek and Frisby.\r\n\r\n\"'They are coming,' said Daisy, shading her eyes. 'Do you see the\r\nspeck on the meadows?'\r\n\r\n\"'It may be a mud-hen,' said the professor.\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Holroyd is right,' I said. 'A wagon and team and two men are\r\ncoming from the north. There's a dog beside the wagon--it's that\r\nmiserable yellow dog of Frisby's.'\r\n\r\n\"'Good gracious!' cried the professor, 'you don't mean to tell me that\r\nyou see all that at such a distance?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why not?' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'I see nothing,' he insisted.\r\n\r\n\"'You will see that I'm right, presently,' I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"The professor removed his blue goggles and rubbed them, glancing\r\nobliquely at me.\r\n\r\n\"'Haven't you heard what extraordinary eyesight duck-shooters have?'\r\nsaid his daughter, looking back at her father. 'Jack says that he can\r\ntell exactly what kind of a duck is flying before most people could\r\nsee anything at all in the sky.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's true,' I said; 'it comes to anybody, I fancy, who has had\r\npractice.'\r\n\r\n\"The professor regarded me with a new interest. There was inspiration\r\nin his eyes. He turned towards the ocean. For a long time he stared at\r\nthe tossing waves on the beach, then he looked far out to where the\r\nhorizon met the sea.\r\n\r\n\"'Are there any ducks out there?' he asked, at last.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said I, scanning the sea, 'there are.'\r\n\r\n\"He produced a pair of binoculars from his coat-tail pocket, adjusted\r\nthem, and raised them to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'H'm! What sort of ducks?'\r\n\r\n\"I looked more carefully, holding both hands over my forehead.\r\n\r\n\"'Surf-ducks and widgeon. There is one bufflehead among them--no, two;\r\nthe rest are coots,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\"'This,' cried the professor, 'is most astonishing. I have good eyes,\r\nbut I can't see a blessed thing without these binoculars!'\r\n\r\n\"'It's not extraordinary,' said I; 'the surf-ducks and coots any\r\nnovice might recognize; the widgeon and buffleheads I should not have\r\nbeen able to name unless they had risen from the water. It is easy to\r\ntell any duck when it is flying, even though it looks no bigger than a\r\nblack pin-point.'\r\n\r\n\"But the professor insisted that it was marvellous, and he said that I\r\nmight render him invaluable service if I would consent to come and\r\ncamp at Pine Inlet for a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\"I looked at his daughter, but she turned her back. Her back was\r\nbeautifully moulded. Her gown fitted also.\r\n\r\n\"'Camp out here?' I repeated, pretending to be unpleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\n\"'I do not think he would care to,' said Miss Holroyd, without\r\nturning.\r\n\r\n\"I had not expected that.\r\n\r\n\"'Above all things,' said I, in a clear, pleasant voice, 'I like to\r\ncamp out.'\r\n\r\n\"She said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"'It is not exactly camping,' said the professor. 'Come, you shall see\r\nour conservatory. Daisy, come, dear! You must put on a heavier frock;\r\nit is getting towards sundown.'\r\n\r\n\"At that moment, over a near dune, two horses' heads appeared,\r\nfollowed by two human heads, then a wagon, then a yellow dog.\r\n\r\n\"I turned triumphantly to the professor.\r\n\r\n\"'You are the very man I want,' he muttered--'the very man--the very\r\nman.'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at Daisy Holroyd. She returned my glance with a defiant\r\nlittle smile.\r\n\r\n\"'Waal,' said Captain McPeek, driving up, 'here we be! Git out,\r\nFrisby.'\r\n\r\n\"Frisby, fat, nervous, and sentimental, hopped out of the cart.\r\n\r\n\"'Come,' said the professor, impatiently moving across the dunes. I\r\nwalked with Daisy Holroyd. McPeek and Frisby followed. The yellow dog\r\nwalked by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The sun was dipping into the sea as we trudged across the meadows\r\ntowards a high, dome-shaped dune covered with cedars and thickets of\r\nsweet bay. I saw no sign of habitation among the sand-hills. Far as\r\nthe eye could reach, nothing broke the gray line of sea and sky save\r\nthe squat dunes crowned with stunted cedars.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as we rounded the base of the dune, we almost walked into the\r\ndoor of a house. My amazement amused Miss Holroyd, and I noticed also\r\na touch of malice in her pretty eyes. But she said nothing, following\r\nher father into the house, with the slightest possible gesture to me.\r\nWas it invitation or was it menace?\r\n\r\n\"The house was merely a light wooden frame, covered with some\r\nwaterproof stuff that looked like a mixture of rubber and tar. Over\r\nthis--in fact, over the whole roof--was pitched an awning of heavy\r\nsail-cloth. I noticed that the house was anchored to the sand by\r\nchains, already rusted red. But this one-storied house was not the\r\nonly building nestling in the south shelter of the big dune. A hundred\r\nfeet away stood another structure--long, low, also built of wood. It\r\nhad rows on rows of round port-holes on every side. The ports were\r\nfitted with heavy glass, hinged to swing open if necessary. A single,\r\nbig double door occupied the front.\r\n\r\n\"Behind this long, low building was still another, a mere shed. Smoke\r\nrose from the sheet-iron chimney. There was somebody moving about\r\ninside the open door.\r\n\r\n\"As I stood gaping at this mushroom hamlet the professor appeared at\r\nthe door and asked me to enter. I stepped in at once.\r\n\r\n\"The house was much larger than I had imagined. A straight hallway ran\r\nthrough the centre from east to west. On either side of this hallway\r\nwere rooms, the doors swinging wide open. I counted three doors on\r\neach side; the three on the south appeared to be bedrooms.\r\n\r\n\"The professor ushered me into a room on the north side, where I found\r\nCaptain McPeek and Frisby sitting at a table, upon which were drawings\r\nand sketches of articulated animals and fishes.\r\n\r\n\"'You see, McPeek,' said the professor, 'we only wanted one more man,\r\nand I think I've got him--Haven't I?' turning eagerly to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, yes,' I said, laughing; 'this is delightful. Am I invited to\r\nstay here?'\r\n\r\n\"'Your bedroom is the third on the south side; everything is ready.\r\nMcPeek, you can bring his trunk to-morrow, can't you?' demanded the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\n\"The red-faced captain nodded, and shifted a quid.\r\n\r\n\"'Then it's all settled,' said the professor, and he drew a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction. 'You see,' he said, turning to me, 'I was at my wit's\r\nend to know whom to trust. I never thought of you. Jack's out in\r\nChina, and I didn't dare trust anybody in my own profession. All you\r\ncare about is writing verses and stories, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n\"'I like to shoot,' I replied, mildly.\r\n\r\n\"'Just the thing!' he cried, beaming at us all in turn. 'Now I can see\r\nno reason why we should not progress rapidly. McPeek, you and Frisby\r\nmust get those boxes up here before dark. Dinner will be ready before\r\nyou have finished unloading. Dick, you will wish to go to your room\r\nfirst.'\r\n\r\n\"My name isn't Dick, but he spoke so kindly, and beamed upon me in\r\nsuch a fatherly manner, that I let it go. I had occasion to correct\r\nhim afterwards, several times, but he always forgot the next minute.\r\nHe calls me Dick to this day.\r\n\r\n\"It was dark when Professor Holroyd, his daughter, and I sat down to\r\ndinner. The room was the same in which I had noticed the drawings of\r\nbeast and bird, but the round table had been extended into an oval,\r\nand neatly spread with dainty linen and silver.\r\n\r\n\"A fresh-cheeked Swedish girl appeared from a farther room, bearing\r\nthe soup. The professor ladled it out, still beaming.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, this is very delightful--isn't it, Daisy?' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Very,' said Miss Holroyd, with a tinge of irony.\r\n\r\n\"'Very,' I repeated, heartily.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose,' said the professor, nodding mysteriously at his\r\ndaughter, 'that Dick knows nothing of what we're about down here?'\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose,' said Miss Holroyd, 'that he thinks we are digging for\r\nfossils.'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at my plate. She might have spared me that.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, well,' said her father, smiling to himself, 'he shall know\r\neverything by morning. You'll be astonished, Dick, my boy.'\r\n\r\n\"'His name isn't Dick,' corrected Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"The professor said, 'Isn't it?' in an absent-minded way, and relapsed\r\ninto contemplation of my necktie.\r\n\r\n\"I asked Miss Holroyd a few questions about Jack, and was informed\r\nthat he had given up law and entered the consular service--as what, I\r\ndid not dare ask, for I know what our consular service is.\r\n\r\n\"'In China,' said Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"'Choo Choo is the name of the city,' added her father, proudly; 'it's\r\nthe terminus of the new trans-Siberian railway.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's on the Pong Ping,' said Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"'He's vice-consul,' added the professor, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"'He'll make a good one,' I observed. I knew Jack. I pitied his\r\nconsul.\r\n\r\n\"So we chatted on about my old playmate, until Freda, the red-cheeked\r\nmaid, brought coffee, and the professor lighted a cigar, with a little\r\nbow to his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"'Of course, you don't smoke,' she said to me, with a glimmer of\r\nmalice in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'He mustn't,' interposed the professor, hastily; 'it will make his\r\nhand tremble.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, it won't,' said I, laughing; 'but my hand will shake if I don't\r\nsmoke. Are you going to employ me as a draughtsman?'\r\n\r\n\"'You'll know to-morrow,' he chuckled, with a mysterious smile at his\r\ndaughter. 'Daisy, give him my best cigars--put the box here on the\r\ntable. We can't afford to have his hand tremble.'\r\n\r\n\"Miss Holroyd rose and crossed the hallway to her father's room,\r\nreturning presently with a box of promising-looking cigars.\r\n\r\n\"'I don't think he knows what is good for him,' she said. 'He should\r\nsmoke only one every day.'\r\n\r\n\"It was hard to bear. I am not vindictive, but I decided to treasure\r\nup a few of Miss Holroyd's gentle taunts. My intimacy with her brother\r\nwas certainly a disadvantage to me now. Jack had apparently been\r\ntalking too much, and his sister appeared to be thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith my past. It was a disadvantage. I remembered her vaguely as a\r\ngirl with long braids, who used to come on Sundays with her father and\r\ntake tea with us in our rooms. Then she went to Germany to school, and\r\nJack and I employed our Sunday evenings otherwise. It is true that I\r\nregarded her weekly visits as a species of infliction, but I did not\r\nthink I ever showed it.\r\n\r\n\"'It is strange,' said I, 'that you did not recognize me at once, Miss\r\nHolroyd. Have I changed so greatly in five years?'\r\n\r\n\"'You wore a pointed French beard in Paris,' she said--'a very downy\r\none. And you never stayed to tea but twice, and then you only spoke\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' said I, blankly. 'What did I say?'\r\n\r\n\"'You asked me if I liked plums,' said Daisy, bursting into an\r\nirresistible ripple of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that I must have made the same sort of an ass of myself that\r\nmost boys of eighteen do.\r\n\r\n\"It was too bad. I never thought about the future in those days. Who\r\ncould have imagined that little Daisy Holroyd would have grown up into\r\nthis bewildering young lady? It was really too bad. Presently the\r\nprofessor retired to his room, carrying with him an armful of\r\ndrawings, and bidding us not to sit up late. When he closed his door\r\nMiss Holroyd turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Papa will work over those drawings until midnight,' she said, with a\r\ndespairing smile.\r\n\r\n\"'It isn't good for him,' I said. 'What are the drawings?'\r\n\r\n\"'You may know to-morrow,' she answered, leaning forward on the table\r\nand shading her face with one hand. 'Tell me about yourself and Jack\r\nin Paris.'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at her suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"'What! There isn't much to tell. We studied. Jack went to the law\r\nschool, and I attended--er--oh, all sorts of schools.'\r\n\r\n\"'Did you? Surely you gave yourself a little recreation occasionally?'\r\n\r\n\"'Occasionally,' I nodded.\r\n\r\n\"'I am afraid you and Jack studied too hard.'\r\n\r\n\"'That may be,' said I, looking meek.\r\n\r\n\"'Especially about fossils.'\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't stand that.\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Holroyd,' I said, 'I do care for fossils. You may think that I\r\nam a humbug, but I have a perfect mania for fossils--now.'\r\n\r\n\"'Since when?'\r\n\r\n\"'About an hour ago,' I said, airily. Out of the corner of my eye I\r\nsaw that she had flushed up. It pleased me.\r\n\r\n\"'You will soon tire of the experiment,' she said, with a dangerous\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I may,' I replied, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"She drew back. The movement was scarcely perceptible, but I noticed\r\nit, and she knew I did.\r\n\r\n\"The atmosphere was vaguely hostile. One feels such mental conditions\r\nand changes instantly. I picked up a chess-board, opened it, set up\r\nthe pieces with elaborate care, and began to move, first the white,\r\nthen the black. Miss Holroyd watched me coldly at first, but after a\r\ndozen moves she became interested and leaned a shade nearer. I moved a\r\nblack pawn forward.\r\n\r\n\"'Why do you do that?' said Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"'Because,' said I, 'the white queen threatens the pawn.'\r\n\r\n\"'It was an aggressive move,' she insisted.\r\n\r\n\"'Purely defensive,' I said. 'If her white highness will let the pawn\r\nalone, the pawn will let the queen alone.'\r\n\r\n\"Miss Holroyd rested her chin on her wrist and gazed steadily at the\r\nboard. She was flushing furiously, but she held her ground.\r\n\r\n\"'If the white queen doesn't block that pawn, the pawn may become\r\ndangerous,' she said, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I laughed, and closed up the board with a snap.\r\n\r\n\"'True,' I said, 'it might even take the queen.' After a moment's\r\nsilence I asked, 'What would you do in that case, Miss Holroyd?'\r\n\r\n\"'I should resign,' she said, serenely; then, realizing what she had\r\nsaid, she lost her self-possession for a second, and cried: 'No,\r\nindeed! I should fight to the bitter end! I mean--'\r\n\r\n\"'What?' I asked, lingering over my revenge.\r\n\r\n\"'I mean,' she said, slowly, 'that your black pawn would never have\r\nthe chance--never! I should take it immediately.'\r\n\r\n\"'I believe you would,' said I, smiling; 'so we'll call the game\r\nyours, and--the pawn captured.'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't want it,' she exclaimed. 'A pawn is worthless.'\r\n\r\n\"'Except when it's in the king row.'\r\n\r\n\"'Chess is most interesting,' she observed, sedately. She had\r\ncompletely recovered her self-possession. Still I saw that she now had\r\na certain respect for my defensive powers. It was very soothing to me.\r\n\r\n\"'You know,' said I, gravely, 'that I am fonder of Jack than of\r\nanybody. That's the reason we never write each other, except to borrow\r\nthings. I am afraid that when I was a young cub in France I was not an\r\nattractive personality.'\r\n\r\n\"'On the contrary,' said Daisy, smiling, 'I thought you were very big\r\nand very perfect. I had illusions. I wept often when I went home and\r\nremembered that you never took the trouble to speak to me but once.'\r\n\r\n\"'I was a cub,' I said--'not selfish and brutal, but I didn't\r\nunderstand school-girls. I never had any sisters, and I didn't know\r\nwhat to say to very young girls. If I had imagined that you felt\r\nhurt--'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I did--five years ago. Afterwards I laughed at the whole thing.'\r\n\r\n\"'Laughed?' I repeated, vaguely disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, of course. I was very easily hurt when I was a child. I think I\r\nhave outgrown it.'\r\n\r\n\"The soft curve of her sensitive mouth contradicted her.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you forgive me now?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes. I had forgotten the whole thing until I met you an hour or so\r\nago.'\r\n\r\n\"There was something that had a ring not entirely genuine in this\r\nspeech. I noticed it, but forgot it the next moment.\r\n\r\n\"Presently she rose, touched her hair with the tip of one finger, and\r\nwalked to the door.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-night,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-night,' said I, opening the door for her to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The sea was a sheet of silver tinged with pink. The tremendous arch\r\nof the sky was all shimmering and glimmering with the promise of the\r\nsun. Already the mist above, flecked with clustered clouds, flushed\r\nwith rose color and dull gold. I heard the low splash of the waves\r\nbreaking and curling across the beach. A wandering breeze, fresh and\r\nfragrant, blew the curtains of my window. There was the scent of sweet\r\nbay in the room, and everywhere the subtle, nameless perfume of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"When at last I stood upon the shore, the air and sea were all\r\na-glimmer in a rosy light, deepening to crimson in the zenith. Along\r\nthe beach I saw a little cove, shelving and all a-shine, where shallow\r\nwaves washed with a mellow sound. Fine as dusted gold the shingle\r\nglowed, and the thin film of water rose, receded, crept up again a\r\nlittle higher, and again flowed back, with the low hiss of snowy foam\r\nand gilded bubbles breaking.\r\n\r\n\"I stood a little while quiet, my eyes upon the water, the invitation\r\nof the ocean in my ears, vague and sweet as the murmur of a shell.\r\nThen I looked at my bathing-suit and towels.\r\n\r\n\"'In we go!' said I, aloud. A second later the prophecy was\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"I swam far out to sea, and as I swam the waters all around me turned\r\nto gold. The sun had risen.\r\n\r\n\"There is a fragrance in the sea at dawn that none can name.\r\nWhitethorn a-bloom in May, sedges a-sway, and scented rushes rustling\r\nin an inland wind recall the sea to me--I can't say why.\r\n\r\n\"Far out at sea I raised myself, swung around, dived, and set out\r\nagain for shore, striking strong strokes until the necked foam flew.\r\nAnd when at last I shot through the breakers, I laughed aloud and\r\nsprang upon the beach, breathless and happy. Then from the ocean came\r\nanother cry, clear, joyous, and a white arm rose in the air.\r\n\r\n\"She came drifting in with the waves like a white sea-sprite, laughing\r\nat me, and I plunged into the breakers again to join her.\r\n\r\n\"Side by side we swam along the coast, just outside the breakers,\r\nuntil in the next cove we saw the flutter of her maid's cap-strings.\r\n\r\n\"'I will beat you to breakfast!' she cried, as I rested, watching her\r\nglide up along the beach.\r\n\r\n\"'Done!' said I--'for a sea-shell!'\r\n\r\n\"'Done!' she called, across the water.\r\n\r\n\"I made good speed along the shore, and I was not long in dressing,\r\nbut when I entered the dining-room she was there, demure, smiling,\r\nexquisite in her cool, white frock.\r\n\r\n\"'The sea-shell is yours,' said I. 'I hope I can find one with a pearl\r\nin it.'\r\n\r\n\"The professor hurried in before she could reply. He greeted me very\r\ncordially, but there was an abstracted air about him, and he called me\r\nDick until I recognized that remonstrance was useless. He was not\r\nlong over his coffee and rolls.\r\n\r\n\"'McPeek and Frisby will return with the last load, including your\r\ntrunk, by early afternoon,' he said, rising and picking up his bundle\r\nof drawings. 'I haven't time to explain to you what we are doing,\r\nDick, but Daisy will take you about and instruct you. She will give\r\nyou the rifle standing in my room--it's a good Winchester. I have sent\r\nfor an 'Express' for you, big enough to knock over any elephant in\r\nIndia. Daisy, take him through the sheds and tell him everything.\r\nLuncheon is at noon. Do you usually take luncheon, Dick?'\r\n\r\n\"'When I am permitted,' I smiled.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said the professor, doubtfully, 'you mustn't come back here\r\nfor it. Freda can take you what you want. Is your hand unsteady after\r\neating?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, papa!' said Daisy. 'Do you intend to starve him?'\r\n\r\n\"We all laughed.\r\n\r\n\"The professor tucked his drawings into a capacious pocket, pulled his\r\nsea-boots up to his hips, seized a spade, and left, nodding to us as\r\nthough he were thinking of something else.\r\n\r\n\"We went to the door and watched him across the salt meadows until the\r\ndistant sand-dune hid him.\r\n\r\n\"'Come,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'I am going to take you to the shop.'\r\n\r\n\"She put on a broad-brimmed straw hat, a distractingly pretty\r\ncombination of filmy cool stuffs, and led the way to the long, low\r\nstructure that I had noticed the evening before.\r\n\r\n\"The interior was lighted by the numberless little port-holes, and I\r\ncould see everything plainly. I acknowledge I was nonplussed by what I\r\ndid see.\r\n\r\n\"In the centre of the shed, which must have been at least a hundred\r\nfeet long, stood what I thought at first was the skeleton of an\r\nenormous whale. After a moment's silent contemplation of the thing I\r\nsaw that it could not be a whale, for the frames of two gigantic,\r\nbatlike wings rose from each shoulder. Also I noticed that the animal\r\npossessed legs--four of them--with most unpleasant-looking webbed\r\nclaws fully eight feet long. The bony framework of the head, too,\r\nresembled something between a crocodile and a monstrous\r\nsnapping-turtle. The walls of the shanty were hung with drawings and\r\nblue prints. A man dressed in white linen was tinkering with the\r\nvertebrae of the lizard-like tail.\r\n\r\n\"'Where on earth did such a reptile come from?' I asked at length.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, it's not real!' said Daisy, scornfully; 'it's papier-maché.'\r\n\r\n\"'I see,' said I; 'a stage prop.'\r\n\r\n\"'A what?' asked Daisy, in hurt astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, a--a sort of Siegfried dragon--a what's-his-name--er, Pfafner,\r\nor Peffer, or--'\r\n\r\n\"'If my father heard you say such things he would dislike you,' said\r\nDaisy. She looked grieved, and moved towards the door. I\r\napologized--for what, I knew not--and we became reconciled. She ran\r\ninto her father's room and brought me the rifle, a very good\r\nWinchester. She also gave me a cartridge-belt, full.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' she smiled, 'I shall take you to your observatory, and when we\r\narrive you are to begin your duty at once.'\r\n\r\n\"'And that duty?' I ventured, shouldering the rifle.\r\n\r\n\"'That duty is to watch the ocean. I shall then explain the whole\r\naffair--but you mustn't look at me while I speak; you must watch the\r\nsea.'\r\n\r\n\"'This,' said I, 'is hardship. I had rather go without the luncheon.'\r\n\r\n\"I do not think she was offended at my speech; still she frowned for\r\nalmost three seconds.\r\n\r\n\"We passed through acres of sweet bay and spear grass, sometimes\r\nskirting thickets of twisted cedars, sometimes walking in the full\r\nglare of the morning sun, sinking into shifting sand where\r\nsun-scorched shells crackled under our feet, and sun-browned sea-weed\r\nglistened, bronzed and iridescent. Then, as we climbed a little hill,\r\nthe sea-wind freshened in our faces, and lo! the ocean lay below us,\r\nfar-stretching as the eye could reach, glittering, magnificent.\r\n\r\n\"Daisy sat down flat on the sand. It takes a clever girl to do that\r\nand retain the respectful deference due her from men. It takes a\r\ngraceful girl to accomplish it triumphantly when a man is looking.\r\n\r\n\"'You must sit beside me,' she said--as though it would prove irksome\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' she continued, 'you must watch the water while I am talking.'\r\n\r\n\"I nodded.\r\n\r\n\"'Why don't you do it, then?' she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I succeeded in wrenching my head towards the ocean, although I felt\r\nsure it would swing gradually round again in spite of me.\r\n\r\n\"'To begin with,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'there's a thing in that ocean\r\nthat would astonish you if you saw it. Turn your head!'\r\n\r\n\"'I am,' I said, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"'Did you hear what I said?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes--er--a thing in the ocean that's going to astonish me.' Visions\r\nof mermaids rose before me.\r\n\r\n\"'The thing,' said Daisy, 'is a thermosaurus!'\r\n\r\n\"I nodded vaguely, as though anticipating a delightful introduction to\r\na nautical friend.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't seem astonished,' she said, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"'Why should I be?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Please turn your eyes towards the water. Suppose a thermosaurus\r\nshould look out of the waves!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said I, 'in that case the pleasure would be mutual.'\r\n\r\n\"She frowned and bit her upper lip.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know what a thermosaurus is?' she asked.\r\n\r\n\"'If I am to guess,' said I, 'I guess it's a jelly-fish.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's that big, ugly, horrible creature that I showed you in the\r\nshed!' cried Daisy, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"'Eh!' I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"'Not papier-maché, either,' she continued, excitedly; 'it's a real\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"This was pleasant news. I glanced instinctively at my rifle and then\r\nat the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said I at last, 'it strikes me that you and I resemble a pair\r\nof Andromedas waiting to be swallowed. This rifle won't stop a beast,\r\na live beast, like that Nibelungen dragon of yours.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, it will,' she said; 'it's not an ordinary rifle.'\r\n\r\n\"Then, for the first time, I noticed, just below the magazine, a\r\ncylindrical attachment that was strange to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, if you will watch the sea very carefully, and will promise not\r\nto look at me,' said Daisy, 'I will try to explain.'\r\n\r\n\"She did not wait for me to promise, but went on eagerly, a sparkle of\r\nexcitement in her blue eyes:\r\n\r\n\"'You know, of all the fossil remains of the great batlike and\r\nlizard-like creatures that inhabited the earth ages and ages ago, the\r\nbones of the gigantic saurians are the most interesting. I think they\r\nused to splash about the water and fly over the land during the\r\ncarboniferous period; anyway, it doesn't matter. Of course you have\r\nseen pictures of reconstructed creatures such as the ichthyosaurus,\r\nthe plesiosaurus, the anthracosaurus, and the thermosaurus?'\r\n\r\n\"I nodded, trying to keep my eyes from hers.\r\n\r\n\"'And you know that the remains of the thermosaurus were first\r\ndiscovered and reconstructed by papa?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said I. There was no use in saying no.\r\n\r\n\"'I am glad you do. Now, papa has proved that this creature lived\r\nentirely in the Gulf Stream, emerging for occasional flights across an\r\nocean or two. Can you imagine how he proved it?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' said I, resolutely pointing my nose at the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"'He proved it by a minute examination of the microscopical shells\r\nfound among the ribs of the thermosaurus. These shells contained\r\nlittle creatures that live only in the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.\r\nThey were the food of the thermosaurus.'\r\n\r\n\"'It was rather slender rations for a thing like that, wasn't it? Did\r\nhe ever swallow bigger food--er--men?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh yes. Tons of fossil bones from prehistoric men are also found in\r\nthe interior of the thermosaurus.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said I, 'you, at least, had better go back to Captain\r\nMcPeek's--'\r\n\r\n\"'Please turn around; don't be so foolish. I didn't say there was a\r\nlive thermosaurus in the water, did I?'\r\n\r\n\"'Isn't there?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, no!'\r\n\r\n\"My relief was genuine, but I thought of the rifle and looked\r\nsuspiciously out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the Winchester for?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, and I will explain. Papa has found out--how, I do not\r\nexactly understand--that there is in the waters of the Gulf Stream the\r\nbody of a thermosaurus. The creature must have been alive within a\r\nyear or so. The impenetrable scale-armor that covers its body has, as\r\nfar as papa knows, prevented its disintegration. We know that it is\r\nthere still, or was there within a few months. Papa has reports and\r\nsworn depositions from steamer captains and seamen from a dozen\r\ndifferent vessels, all corroborating one another in essential details.\r\nThese stories, of course, get into the newspapers--sea-serpent\r\nstories--but papa knows that they confirm his theory that the huge\r\nbody of this reptile is swinging along somewhere in the Gulf Stream.'\r\n\r\n\"She opened her sunshade and held it over her. I noticed that she\r\ndeigned to give me the benefit of about one-eighth of it.\r\n\r\n\"'Your duty with that rifle is this: if we are fortunate enough to see\r\nthe body of the thermosaurus come floating by, you are to take good\r\naim and fire--fire rapidly every bullet in the magazine; then reload\r\nand fire again, and reload and fire as long as you have any cartridges\r\nleft.'\r\n\r\n\"'A self-feeding Maxim is what I should have,' I said, with gentle\r\nsarcasm. 'Well, and suppose I make a sieve of this big lizard?'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you see these rings in the sand?' she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough, somebody had driven heavy piles deep into the sand all\r\naround us, and to the tops of these piles were attached steel rings,\r\nhalf buried under the spear-grass. We sat almost exactly in the centre\r\nof a circle of these rings.\r\n\r\n\"'The reason is this,' said Daisy; 'every bullet in your cartridges is\r\nsteel-tipped and armor-piercing. To the base of each bullet is\r\nattached a thin wire of pallium. Pallium is that new metal, a thread\r\nof which, drawn out into finest wire, will hold a ton of iron\r\nsuspended. Every bullet is fitted with minute coils of miles of this\r\nwire. When the bullet leaves the rifle it spins out this wire as a\r\nshot from a life-saver's mortar spins out and carries the life-line to\r\na wrecked ship. The end of each coil of wire is attached to that\r\ncylinder under the magazine of your rifle. As soon as the shell is\r\nautomatically ejected this wire flies out also. A bit of scarlet tape\r\nis fixed to the end, so that it will be easy to pick up. There is also\r\na snap-clasp on the end, and this clasp fits those rings that you see\r\nin the sand. Now, when you begin firing, it is my duty to run and pick\r\nup the wire ends and attach them to the rings. Then, you see, we have\r\nthe body of the thermosaurus full of bullets, every bullet anchored to\r\nthe shore by tiny wires, each of which could easily hold a ton's\r\nstrain.'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' she added, calmly, 'we have captured the thermosaurus.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your father,' said I, at length, 'must have spent years of labor\r\nover this preparation.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is the work of a lifetime,' she said, simply.\r\n\r\n\"My face, I suppose, showed my misgivings.\r\n\r\n\"'It must not fail,' she added.\r\n\r\n\"'But--but we are nowhere near the Gulf Stream,' I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Her face brightened, and she frankly held the sunshade over us both.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, you don't know,' she said, 'what else papa has discovered. Would\r\nyou believe that he has found a loop in the Gulf Stream--a genuine\r\nloop--that swings in here just outside of the breakers below? It is\r\ntrue! Everybody on Long Island knows that there is a warm current off\r\nthe coast, but nobody imagined it was merely a sort of backwater from\r\nthe Gulf Stream that formed a great circular mill-race around the cone\r\nof a subterranean volcano, and rejoined the Gulf Stream off Cape\r\nAlbatross. But it is! That is why papa bought a yacht three years ago\r\nand sailed about for two years so mysteriously. Oh, I did want to go\r\nwith him so much!'\r\n\r\n\"'This,' said I, 'is most astonishing.'\r\n\r\n\"She leaned enthusiastically towards me, her lovely face aglow.\r\n\r\n\"'Isn't it?' she said; 'and to think that you and papa and I are the\r\nonly people in the whole world who know this!'\r\n\r\n\"To be included in such a triology was very delightful.\r\n\r\n\"'Papa is writing the whole thing--I mean about the currents. He also\r\nhas in preparation sixteen volumes on the thermosaurus. He said this\r\nmorning that he was going to ask you to write the story first for some\r\nscientific magazine. He is certain that Professor Bruce Stoddard, of\r\nColumbia, will write the pamphlets necessary. This will give papa time\r\nto attend to the sixteen-volume work, which he expects to finish in\r\nthree years.'\r\n\r\n\"'Let us first,' said I, laughing, 'catch our thermosaurus.'\r\n\r\n\"'We must not fail,' she said, wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"'We shall not fail,' I said, 'for I promise to sit on this sand-hill\r\nas long as I live--until a thermosaurus appears--if that is your wish,\r\nMiss Holroyd.'\r\n\r\n\"Our eyes met for an instant. She did not chide me, either, for not\r\nlooking at the ocean. Her eyes were bluer, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose,' she said, bending her head and absently pouring sand\r\nbetween her fingers--'I suppose you think me a blue-stocking, or\r\nsomething odious?'\r\n\r\n\"'Not exactly,' I said. There was an emphasis in my voice that made\r\nher color. After a moment she laid the sunshade down, still open.\r\n\r\n\"'May I hold it?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"She nodded almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n\"The ocean had turned a deep marine blue, verging on purple, that\r\nheralded a scorching afternoon. The wind died away; the odor of cedar\r\nand sweet-bay hung heavy in the air.\r\n\r\n\"In the sand at our feet an iridescent flower-beetle crawled, its\r\nmetallic green-and-blue wings burning like a spark. Great gnats, with\r\nfilmy, glittering wings, danced aimlessly above the young golden-rod;\r\nburnished crickets, inquisitive, timid, ran from under chips of\r\ndriftwood, waved their antennæ at us, and ran back again. One by one\r\nthe marbled tiger-beetles tumbled at our feet, dazed from the exertion\r\nof an aërial flight, then scrambled and ran a little way, or darted\r\ninto the wire grass, where great, brilliant spiders eyed them askance\r\nfrom their gossamer hammocks.\r\n\r\n\"Far out at sea the white gulls floated and drifted on the water, or\r\nsailed up into the air to flap lazily for a moment and settle back\r\namong the waves. Strings of black surf-ducks passed, their strong\r\nwings tipping the surface of the water; single wandering coots whirled\r\nfrom the breakers into lonely flight towards the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"We lay and watched the little ring-necks running along the water's\r\nedge, now backing away from the incoming tide, now boldly wading after\r\nthe undertow. The harmony of silence, the deep perfume, the mystery of\r\nwaiting for that something that all await--what is it? love? death? or\r\nonly the miracle of another morrow?--troubled me with vague\r\nrestlessness. As sunlight casts shadows, happiness, too, throws a\r\nshadow, an the shadow is sadness.\r\n\r\n\"And so the morning wore away until Freda came with a cool-looking\r\nhamper. Then delicious cold fowl and lettuce sandwiches and champagne\r\ncup set our tongues wagging as only very young tongues can wag. Daisy\r\nwent back with Freda after luncheon, leaving me a case of cigars, with\r\na bantering smile. I dozed, half awake, keeping a partly closed eye on\r\nthe ocean, where a faint gray streak showed plainly amid the azure\r\nwater all around. That was the Gulf Stream loop.\r\n\r\n\"About four o'clock Frisby appeared with a bamboo shelter-tent, for\r\nwhich I was unaffectedly grateful.\r\n\r\n\"After he had erected it over me he stopped to chat a bit, but the\r\nconversation bored me, for he could talk of nothing but bill-posting.\r\n\r\n\"'You wouldn't ruin the landscape here, would you?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Ruin it!' repeated Frisby, nervously. 'It's ruined now; there ain't\r\na place to stick a bill.'\r\n\r\n\"'The snipe stick bills--in the sand,' I said, flippantly.\r\n\r\n\"There was no humor about Frisby. 'Do they?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I moved with a certain impatience.\r\n\r\n\"'Bills,' said Frisby, 'give spice an' variety to nature. They break\r\nthe monotony of the everlastin' green and what-you-may-call-its.'\r\n\r\n\"I glared at him.\r\n\r\n\"'Bills,' he continued, 'are not easy to stick, lemme tell you, sir.\r\nSign-paintin's a soft snap when it comes to bill-stickin'. Now, I\r\nguess I've stuck more bills onto New York State than ennybody.'\r\n\r\n\"'Have you?' I said, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, siree! I always pick out the purtiest spots--kinder filled\r\nchuck full of woods and brooks and things; then I h'ist my paste-pot\r\nonto a rock, and I slather that rock with gum, and whoop she goes!'\r\n\r\n\"'Whoop what goes?'\r\n\r\n\"'The bill. I paste her onto the rock, with one swipe of the brush for\r\nthe edges and a back-handed swipe for the finish--except when a bill\r\nis folded in two halves.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what do you do then?' I asked, disgusted.\r\n\r\n\"'Swipe twice,' said Frisby, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"'And you don't think it injures the landscape?'\r\n\r\n\"'Injures it!' he exclaimed, convinced that I was attempting to joke.\r\n\r\n\"I looked wearily out to sea. He also looked at the water and sighed\r\nsentimentally.\r\n\r\n\"'Floatin' buoys with bills onto 'em is a idea of mine,' he observed.\r\n'That damn ocean is monotonous, ain't it?'\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I might have done to Frisby--the rifle was so\r\nconvenient--if his mean yellow dog had not waddled up at this\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\n\"'Hi, Davy, sic 'em!' said Frisby, expectorating upon a clam-shell and\r\nhurling it seaward. The cur watched the flight of the shell\r\napathetically, then squatted in the sand and looked at his master.\r\n\r\n\"'Kinder lost his spirit,' said Frisby, 'ain't he? I once stuck a bill\r\nonto Davy, an' it come off, an' the paste sorter sickened him. He was\r\nhell on rats--once!'\r\n\r\n\"After a moment or two Frisby took himself off, whistling cheerfully\r\nto Davy, who followed him when he was ready. The rifle burned in my\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly six o'clock when the professor appeared, spade on\r\nshoulder, boots smeared with mud.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' he said, 'nothing to report, Dick, my boy?'\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing, professor.'\r\n\r\n\"He wiped his shining face with his handkerchief and stared at the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"'My calculations lead me to believe,' he said, 'that our prize may be\r\ndue any day now. This theory I base upon the result of the report from\r\nthe last sea-captain I saw. I cannot understand why some of these\r\ncaptains did not take the carcass in tow. They all say that they\r\ntried, but that the body sank before they could come within half a\r\nmile. The truth is, probably, that they did not stir a foot from their\r\ncourse to examine the thing.'\r\n\r\n\"'Have you ever cruised about for it?' I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"'For two years,' he said, grimly. 'It's no use; it's accident when a\r\nship falls in with it. One captain reports it a thousand miles from\r\nwhere the last skipper spoke it, and always in the Gulf Stream. They\r\nthink it is a different specimen every time, and the papers are\r\nteeming with sea-serpent fol-de-rol.'\r\n\r\n\"'Are you sure,' I asked, 'that it will swing into the coast on this\r\nGulf Stream loop?'\r\n\r\n\"'I think I may say that it is certain to do so. I experimented with a\r\ndead right-whale. You may have heard of its coming ashore here last\r\nsummer.'\r\n\r\n\"'I think I did,' said I, with a faint smile. The thing had poisoned\r\nthe air for miles around.\r\n\r\n\"'But,' I continued, 'suppose it comes in the night?'\r\n\r\n\"He laughed.\r\n\r\n\"'There I am lucky. Every night this month, and every day, too, the\r\ncurrent of the loop runs inland so far that even a porpoise would\r\nstrand for at least twelve hours. Longer than that I have not\r\nexperimented with, but I know that the shore trend of the loop runs\r\nacross a long spur of the submerged volcanic mountain, and that\r\nanything heavier than a porpoise would scrape the bottom and be\r\ncarried so slowly that at least twelve hours must elapse before the\r\ncarcass could float again into deep water. There are chances of its\r\nstranding indefinitely, too, but I don't care to take those chances.\r\nThat is why I have stationed you here, Dick.'\r\n\r\n\"He glanced again at the water, smiling to himself.\r\n\r\n\"'There is another question I want to ask,' I said, 'if you don't\r\nmind.'\r\n\r\n\"'Of course not!' he said, warmly.\r\n\r\n\"'What are you digging for?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, simply for exercise. The doctor told me I was killing myself\r\nwith my sedentary habits, so I decided to dig. I don't know a better\r\nexercise. Do you?'\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose not,' I murmured, rather red in the face. I wondered\r\nwhether he'd mention fossils.\r\n\r\n\"'Did Daisy tell you why we are making our papier-maché thermosaurus?'\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"I shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"'We constructed that from measurements I took from the fossil remains\r\nof the thermosaurus in the Metropolitan Museum. Professor Bruce\r\nStoddard made the drawings. We set it up here, all ready to receive\r\nthe skin of the carcass that I am expecting.'\r\n\r\n\"We had started towards home, walking slowly across the darkening\r\ndunes, shoulder to shoulder. The sand was deep, and walking was not\r\neasy.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish,' said I at last, 'that I knew why Miss Holroyd asked me not\r\nto walk on the beach. It's much less fatiguing.'\r\n\r\n\"'That,' said the professor, 'is a matter that I intend to discuss\r\nwith you to-night.' He spoke gravely, almost sadly. I felt that\r\nsomething of unparalleled importance was soon to be revealed. So I\r\nkept very quiet, watching the ocean out of the corners of my eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dinner was ended. Daisy Holroyd lighted her father's pipe for him,\r\nand insisted on my smoking as much as I pleased. Then she sat down,\r\nand folded her hands like a good little girl, waiting for her father\r\nto make the revelation which I felt in my bones must be something out\r\nof the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\"The professor smoked for a while, gazing meditatively at his\r\ndaughter; then, fixing his gray eyes on me, he said:\r\n\r\n\"'Have you ever heard of the kree--that Australian bird, half parrot,\r\nhalf hawk, that destroys so many sheep in New South Wales?'\r\n\r\n\"I nodded.\r\n\r\n\"'The kree kills a sheep by alighting on its back and tearing away the\r\nflesh with its hooked beak until a vital part is reached. You know\r\nthat? Well, it has been discovered that the kree had prehistoric\r\nprototypes. These birds were enormous creatures, who preyed upon\r\nmammoths and mastodons, and even upon the great saurians. It has been\r\nconclusively proved that a few saurians have been killed by the\r\nancestors of the kree, but the favorite food of these birds was\r\nundoubtedly the thermosaurus. It is believed that the birds attacked\r\nthe eyes of the thermosaurus, and when, as was its habit, the mammoth\r\ncreature turned on its back to claw them, they fell upon the thinner\r\nscales of its stomach armor and finally killed it. This, of course, is\r\na theory, but we have almost absolute proofs of its correctness. Now,\r\nthese two birds are known among scientists as the ekaf-bird and the\r\nool-yllik. The names are Australian, in which country most of their\r\nremains have been unearthed. They lived during the Carboniferous\r\nperiod. Now, it is not generally known, but the fact is, that in 1801\r\nCaptain Ransom, of the British exploring vessel _Gull_, purchased from\r\nthe natives of Tasmania the skin of an ekaf-bird that could not have\r\nbeen killed more than twenty-four hours previous to its sale. I saw\r\nthis skin in the British Museum. It was labelled, \"Unknown bird,\r\nprobably extinct.\" It took me exactly a week to satisfy myself that it\r\nwas actually the skin of an ekaf-bird. But that is not all, Dick,'\r\ncontinued the professor, excitedly. 'In 1854 Admiral Stuart, of our\r\nown navy, saw the carcass of a strange, gigantic bird floating along\r\nthe southern coast of Australia. Sharks were after it, and before a\r\nboat could be lowered these miserable fish got it. But the good old\r\nadmiral secured a few feathers and sent them to the Smithsonian. I saw\r\nthem. They were not even labelled, but I knew that they were feathers\r\nfrom the ekaf-bird or its near relative, the ool-yllik.'\r\n\r\n\"I had grown so interested that I had leaned far across the table.\r\nDaisy, too, bent forward. It was only when the professor paused for a\r\nmoment that I noticed how close together our heads were--Daisy's and\r\nmine. I don't think she realized it. She did not move.\r\n\r\n\"'Now comes the important part of this long discourse,' said the\r\nprofessor, smiling at our eagerness. \"'Ever since the carcass of our\r\nderelict thermosaurus was first noticed, every captain who has seen it\r\nhas also reported the presence of one or more gigantic birds in the\r\nneighborhood. These birds, at a great distance, appeared to be\r\nhovering over the carcass, but on the approach of a vessel they\r\ndisappeared. Even in mid-ocean they were observed. When I heard about\r\nit I was puzzled. A month later I was satisfied that neither the\r\nekaf-bird nor the ool-yllik was extinct. Last Monday I knew that I was\r\nright. I found forty-eight distinct impressions of the huge,\r\nseven-toed claw of the ekaf-bird on the beach here at Pine Inlet. You\r\nmay imagine my excitement. I succeeded in digging up enough wet sand\r\naround one of these impressions to preserve its form. I managed to get\r\nit into a soap-box, and now it is there in my shop. The tide rose too\r\nrapidly for me to save the other footprints.'\r\n\r\n\"I shuddered at the possibility of a clumsy misstep on my part\r\nobliterating the impression of an ool-yllik.\r\n\r\n\"'That is the reason that my daughter warned you off the beach,' he\r\nsaid, mildly.\r\n\r\n\"'Hanging would have been too good for the vandal who destroyed such\r\npriceless prizes,' I cried out, in self-reproach.\r\n\r\n\"Daisy Holroyd turned a flushed face to mine and impulsively laid her\r\nhand on my sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"'How could you know?' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'It's all right now,' said her father, emphasizing each word with a\r\ngentle tap of his pipe-bowl on the table-edge; 'don't be hard on\r\nyourself, Dick. You'll do yeoman's service yet.'\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly midnight, and still we chatted on about the\r\nthermosaurus, the ekaf-bird, and the ool-yllik, eagerly discussing the\r\nprobability of the great reptile's carcass being in the vicinity. That\r\nalone seemed to explain the presence of these prehistoric birds at\r\nPine Inlet.\r\n\r\n\"'Do they ever attack human beings?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The professor looked startled.\r\n\r\n\"'Gracious!' he exclaimed, 'I never thought of that. And Daisy running\r\nabout out-of-doors! Dear me! It takes a scientist to be an unnatural\r\nparent!'\r\n\r\n\"His alarm was half real, half assumed; but, all the same, he glanced\r\ngravely at us both, shaking his handsome head, absorbed in thought.\r\nDaisy herself looked a little doubtful. As for me, my sensations were\r\ndistinctly queer.\r\n\r\n\"'It is true,' said the professor, frowning at the wall, 'that human\r\nremains have been found associated with the bones of the ekaf-bird--I\r\ndon't know how intimately. It is a matter to be taken into most\r\nserious consideration.'\r\n\r\n\"'The problem can be solved,' said I, 'in several ways. One is, to\r\nkeep Miss Holroyd in the house--'\r\n\r\n\"'I shall not stay in,' cried Daisy, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"We all laughed, and her father assured her that she should not be\r\nabused.\r\n\r\n\"'Even if I did stay in,' she said, 'one of these birds might alight\r\non Master Dick.'\r\n\r\n\"She looked saucily at me as she spoke, but turned crimson when her\r\nfather observed, quietly, 'You don't seem to think of me, Daisy!'\r\n\r\n\"'Of course I do,' she said, getting up and putting both arms around\r\nher father's neck; 'but Dick--as--as you call him--is so helpless and\r\ntimid.'\r\n\r\n\"My blissful smile froze on my lips.\r\n\r\n\"'Timid!' I repeated.\r\n\r\n\"She came back to the table, making me a mocking reverence.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think I am to be laughed at with impunity?' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'What are your other plans, Dick?' asked the professor. 'Daisy, let\r\nhim alone, you little tease!'\r\n\r\n\"'One is, to haul a lot of cast-iron boilers along the dunes,' I said.\r\n'If these birds come when the carcass floats in, and if they seem\r\ndisposed to trouble us, we could crawl into the boilers and be safe.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, that is really brilliant!' cried Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"'Be quiet, my child. Dick, the plan is sound and sensible and\r\nperfectly practical. McPeek and Frisby shall go for a dozen loads of\r\nboilers to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n\"'It will spoil the beauty of the landscape,' said Daisy, with a\r\ntaunting nod to me.\r\n\r\n\"'And Frisby will probably attempt to cover them with bill-posters,' I\r\nadded, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"'That,' said Daisy, 'I shall prevent, even at the cost of his life.'\r\nAnd she stood up, looking very determined.\r\n\r\n\"'Children, children,' protested the professor, 'go to bed--you bother\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n\"Then I turned deliberately to Miss Holroyd.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-night, Daisy,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-night, Dick,' she said, very gently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The week passed quickly for me, leaving but few definite impressions.\r\nAs I look back to it now I can see the long stretch of beach burning\r\nin the fierce sunlight, the endless meadows, with the glimmer of water\r\nin the distance, the dunes, the twisted cedars, the leagues of\r\nscintillating ocean, rocking, rocking, always rocking. In the starlit\r\nnights the curlew came in from the sand-bars by twos and threes; I\r\ncould hear their querulous call as I lay in bed thinking. All day long\r\nthe little ring-necks whistled from the shore. The plover answered\r\nthem from distant, lonely inland pools. The great white gulls drifted\r\nlike feathers upon the sea.\r\n\r\n\"One morning towards the end of the week, I, strolling along the\r\ndunes, came upon Frisby. He was bill-posting. I caught him red-handed.\r\n\r\n\"'This,' said I, 'must stop. Do you understand, Mr. Frisby?'\r\n\r\n\"He stepped back from his work, laying his head on one side,\r\nconsidering first me, then the bill that he had pasted on one of our\r\nbig boilers.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't you like the color?' he asked. 'It goes well on them black\r\nboilers.'\r\n\r\n\"'Color! No, I don't like the color, either. Can't you understand that\r\nthere are some people in the world who object to seeing\r\npatent-medicine advertisements scattered over a landscape?'\r\n\r\n\"'Hey?' he said, perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you kindly remove that advertisement?' I persisted.\r\n\r\n\"'Too late,' said Frisby; 'it's sot.'\r\n\r\n\"I was too disgusted to speak, but my disgust turned to anger when I\r\nperceived that, as far as the eye could reach, our boilers, lying from\r\nthree to four hundred feet apart, were ablaze with yellow-and-red\r\nposters extolling the 'Eureka Liver Pill Company.'\r\n\r\n\"'It don't cost 'em nothin',' said Frisby, cheerfully; 'I done it fur\r\nthe fun of it. Purty, ain't it?'\r\n\r\n\"'They are Professor Holroyd's boilers,' I said, subduing a desire to\r\nbeat Frisby with my telescope. 'Wait until Miss Holroyd sees this\r\nwork.'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't she like yeller and red?' he demanded, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"'You'll find out,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"Frisby gaped at his handiwork and then at his yellow dog. After a\r\nmoment he mechanically spat on a clam-shell and requested Davy to\r\n'sic' it.\r\n\r\n\"'Can't you comprehend that you have ruined our pleasure in the\r\nlandscape?' I asked, more mildly.\r\n\r\n\"'I've got some green bills,' said Frisby; 'I kin stick 'em over the\r\nyeller ones--'\r\n\r\n\"'Confound it,' said I, 'it isn't the color!'\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' observed Frisby, 'you don't like them pills. I've got some\r\nbills of the \"Cropper Automobile\" and a few of \"Bagley, the Gents'\r\nTailor\"--'\r\n\r\n\"'Frisby,' said I, 'use them all--paste the whole collection over your\r\ndog and yourself--then walk off the cliff.'\r\n\r\n\"He sullenly unfolded a green poster, swabbed the boiler with paste,\r\nlaid the upper section of the bill upon it, and plastered the whole\r\nbill down with a thwack of his brush. As I walked away I heard him\r\nmuttering.\r\n\r\n\"Next day Daisy was so horrified that I promised to give Frisby an\r\nultimatum. I found him with Freda, gazing sentimentally at his work,\r\nand I sent him back to the shop in a hurry, telling Freda at the same\r\ntime that she could spend her leisure in providing Mr. Frisby with\r\nsand, soap, and a scrubbing-brush. Then I walked on to my post of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"I watched until sunset. Daisy came with her father to hear my report,\r\nbut there was nothing to tell, and we three walked slowly back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"In the evenings the professor worked on his volumes, the click of his\r\ntype-writer sounding faintly behind his closed door. Daisy and I\r\nplayed chess sometimes; sometimes we played hearts. I don't remember\r\nthat we ever finished a game of either--we talked too much.\r\n\r\n\"Our discussions covered every topic of interest: we argued upon\r\npolitics; we skimmed over literature and music; we settled\r\ninternational differences; we spoke vaguely of human brotherhood. I\r\nsay we slighted no subject of interest--I am wrong; we never spoke of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"Now, love is a matter of interest to ten people out of ten. Why it\r\nwas that it did not appear to interest us is as interesting a question\r\nas love itself. We were young, alert, enthusiastic, inquiring. We\r\neagerly absorbed theories concerning any curious phenomena in nature,\r\nas intellectual cocktails to stimulate discussion. And yet we did not\r\ndiscuss love. I do not say that we avoided it. No; the subject was\r\ntoo completely ignored for even that. And yet we found it very\r\ndifficult to pass an hour separated. The professor noticed this, and\r\nlaughed at us. We were not even embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday passed in pious contemplation of the ocean. Daisy read a\r\nlittle in her prayer-book, and the professor threw a cloth over his\r\ntype-writer and strolled up and down the sands. He may have been lost\r\nin devout abstraction; he may have been looking for footprints. As for\r\nme, my mind was very serene, and I was more than happy. Daisy read to\r\nme a little for my soul's sake, and the professor came up and said\r\nsomething cheerful. He also examined the magazine of my Winchester.\r\n\r\n\"That night, too, Daisy took her guitar to the sands and sang one or\r\ntwo Basque hymns. Unlike us, the Basques do not take their pleasures\r\nsadly. One of their pleasures is evidently religion.\r\n\r\n\"The big moon came up over the dunes and stared at the sea until the\r\nsurface of every wave trembled with radiance. A sudden stillness fell\r\nacross the world; the wind died out; the foam ran noiselessly across\r\nthe beach; the cricket's rune was stilled.\r\n\r\n\"I leaned back, dropping one hand upon the sand. It touched another\r\nhand, soft and cool.\r\n\r\n\"After a while the other hand moved slightly, and I found that my own\r\nhad closed above it. Presently one finger stirred a little--only a\r\nlittle--for our fingers were interlocked.\r\n\r\n\"On the shore the foam-froth bubbled and winked and glimmered in the\r\nmoonlight. A star fell from the zenith, showering the night with\r\nincandescent dust.\r\n\r\n\"If our fingers lay interlaced beside us, her eyes were calm and\r\nserene as always, wide open, fixed upon the depths of a dark sky. And\r\nwhen her father rose and spoke to us, she did not withdraw her hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Is it late?' she asked, dreamily.\r\n\r\n\"'It is midnight, little daughter.'\r\n\r\n\"I stood up, still holding her hand, and aided her to rise. And when,\r\nat the door, I said good-night, she turned and looked at me for a\r\nlittle while in silence, then passed into her room slowly, with head\r\nstill turned towards me.\r\n\r\n\"All night long I dreamed of her; and when the east whitened, I sprang\r\nup, the thunder of the ocean in my ears, the strong sea-wind blowing\r\ninto the open window.\r\n\r\n\"'She's asleep,' I thought, and I leaned from the window and peered\r\nout into the east.\r\n\r\n\"The sea called to me, tossing its thousand arms; the soaring gulls,\r\ndipping, rising, wheeling above the sandbar, screamed and clamored for\r\na playmate. I slipped into my bathing-suit, dropped from the window\r\nupon the soft sand, and in a moment had plunged head foremost into the\r\nsurf, swimming beneath the waves towards the open sea.\r\n\r\n\"Under the tossing ocean the voice of the waters was in my ears--a\r\nlow, sweet voice, intimate, mysterious. Through singing foam and\r\nbroad, green, glassy depths, by whispering sandy channels atrail with\r\nsea-weed, and on, on, out into the vague, cool sea, I sped, rising to\r\nthe top, sinking, gliding. Then at last I flung myself out of water,\r\nhands raised, and the clamor of the gulls filled my ears.\r\n\r\n\"As I lay, breathing fast, drifting on the sea, far out beyond the\r\ngulls I saw a flash of white, and an arm was lifted, signalling me.\r\n\r\n\"'Daisy!' I called.\r\n\r\n\"A clear hail came across the water, distinct on the sea-wind, and at\r\nthe same instant we raised our hands and moved towards each other.\r\n\r\n\"How we laughed as we met in the sea! The white dawn came up out of\r\nthe depths, the zenith turned to rose and ashes.\r\n\r\n\"And with the dawn came the wind--a great sea-wind, fresh, aromatic,\r\nthat hurled our voices back into our throats and lifted the sheeted\r\nspray above our heads. Every wave, crowned with mist, caught us in a\r\ncool embrace, cradled us, and slipped away, only to leave us to\r\nanother wave, higher, stronger, crested with opalescent glory,\r\nbreathing incense.\r\n\r\n\"We turned together up the coast, swimming lightly side by side, but\r\nour words were caught up by the winds and whirled into the sky.\r\n\r\n\"We looked up at the driving clouds; we looked out upon the pallid\r\nwaste of waters, but it was into each other's eyes we looked,\r\nwondering, wistful, questioning the reason of sky and sea And there in\r\neach other's eyes we read the mystery, and we knew that earth and sky\r\nand sea were created for us alone.\r\n\r\n\"Drifting on by distant sands and dunes, her white fingers touching\r\nmine, we spoke, keying our tones to the wind's vast harmony. And we\r\nspoke of love.\r\n\r\n\"Gray and wide as the limitless span of the sky and the sea, the winds\r\ngathered from the world's ends to bear us on; but they were not\r\nfamiliar winds; for now, along the coast, the breakers curled and\r\nshowed a million fangs, and the ocean stirred to its depths, uneasy,\r\nominous, and the menace of its murmur drew us closer as we moved.\r\n\r\n\"Where the dull thunder and the tossing spray warned us from sunken\r\nreefs, we heard the harsh challenges of gulls; where the pallid surf\r\ntwisted in yellow coils of spume above the bar, the singing sands\r\nmurmured of treachery and secrets of lost souls agasp in the throes of\r\nsilent undertows.\r\n\r\n\"But there was a little stretch of beach glimmering through the\r\nmountains of water, and towards this we turned, side by side. Around\r\nus the water grew warmer; the breath of the following waves moistened\r\nour cheeks; the water itself grew gray and strange about us.\r\n\r\n\"'We have come too far,' I said; but she only answered:\r\n\r\n\"'Faster, faster! I am afraid!' The water was almost hot now; its\r\naromatic odor filled our lungs.\r\n\r\n\"'The Gulf loop!' I muttered. 'Daisy, shall I help you?'\r\n\r\n\"'No. Swim--close by me! Oh-h! Dick--'\r\n\r\n\"Her startled cry was echoed by another--a shrill scream, unutterably\r\nhorrible--and a great bird flapped from the beach, splashing and\r\nbeating its pinions across the water with a thundering noise.\r\n\r\n\"Out across the waves it blundered, rising little by little from the\r\nwater, and now, to my horror, I saw another monstrous bird swinging in\r\nthe air above it, squealing as it turned on its vast wings. Before I\r\ncould speak we touched the beach, and I half lifted her to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"'Quick!' I repeated. 'We must not wait.'\r\n\r\n\"Her eyes were dark with fear, but she rested a hand on my shoulder,\r\nand we crept up among the dune-grasses and sank down by the point of\r\nsand where the rough shelter stood, surrounded by the iron-ringed\r\npiles.\r\n\r\n\"She lay there, breathing fast and deep, dripping with spray. I had no\r\npower of speech left, but when I rose wearily to my knees and looked\r\nout upon the water my blood ran cold. Above the ocean, on the breast\r\nof the roaring wind, three enormous birds sailed, turning and wheeling\r\namong one another; and below, drifting with the gray stream of the\r\nGulf loop, a colossal bulk lay half submerged--a gigantic lizard,\r\nfloating belly upward.\r\n\r\n\"Then Daisy crept kneeling to my side and touched me, trembling from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n\"'I know,' I muttered. 'I must run back for the rifle.'\r\n\r\n\"'And--and leave me?'\r\n\r\n\"I took her by the hand, and we dragged ourselves through the\r\nwire-grass to the open end of a boiler lying in the sand.\r\n\r\n\"She crept in on her hands and knees, and called to me to follow.\r\n\r\n\"'You are safe now,' I cried. 'I must go back for the rifle.'\r\n\r\n\"'The birds may--may attack you.'\r\n\r\n\"'If they do I can get into one of the other boilers,' I said. 'Daisy,\r\nyou must not venture out until I come back. You won't, will you?'\r\n\r\n\"'No-o,' she whispered, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"'Then--good-bye.'\r\n\r\n\"'Good-bye,' she answered, but her voice was very small and still.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-bye,' I said again. I was kneeling at the mouth of the big\r\niron tunnel; it was dark inside and I could not see her, but, before I\r\nwas conscious of it, her arms were around my neck and we had kissed\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember how I went away. When I came to my proper senses I\r\nwas swimming along the coast at full speed, and over my head wheeled\r\none of the birds, screaming at every turn.\r\n\r\n\"The intoxication of that innocent embrace, the close impress of her\r\narms around my neck, gave me a strength and recklessness that neither\r\nfear nor fatigue could subdue. The bird above me did not even frighten\r\nme. I watched it over my shoulder, swimming strongly, with the tide\r\nnow aiding me, now stemming my course; but I saw the shore passing\r\nquickly, and my strength increased, and I shouted when I came in sight\r\nof the house, and scrambled up on the sand, dripping and excited.\r\nThere was nobody in sight, and I gave a last glance up into the air\r\nwhere the bird wheeled, still screeching, and hastened into the house.\r\nFreda stared at me in amazement as I seized the rifle and shouted for\r\nthe professor.\r\n\r\n\"'He has just gone to town, with Captain McPeek in his wagon,'\r\nstammered Freda.\r\n\r\n\"'What!' I cried. 'Does he know where his daughter is?'\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Holroyd is asleep--not?' gasped Freda.\r\n\r\n\"'Where's Frisby?' I cried, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"'Yimmie?' quavered Freda.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, Jimmie; isn't there anybody here? Good Heavens! where's that\r\nman in the shop?'\r\n\r\n\"'He also iss gone,' said Freda, shedding tears, 'to buy papier-maché.\r\nYimmie, he iss gone to post bills.'\r\n\r\n\"I waited to hear no more, but swung my rifle over my shoulder, and,\r\nhanging the cartridge-belt across my chest, hurried out and up the\r\nbeach. The bird was not in sight.\r\n\r\n\"I had been running for perhaps a minute when, far up on the dunes, I\r\nsaw a yellow dog rush madly through a clump of sweet-bay, and at the\r\nsame moment a bird soared past, rose, and hung hovering just above the\r\nthicket. Suddenly the bird swooped; there was a shriek and a yelp from\r\nthe cur, but the bird gripped it in one claw and beat its wings upon\r\nthe sand, striving to rise. Then I saw Frisby--paste, bucket, and\r\nbrush raised--fall upon the bird, yelling lustily. The fierce creature\r\nrelaxed its talons, and the dog rushed on, squeaking with terror. The\r\nbird turned on Frisby and sent him sprawling on his face, a sticky\r\nmass of paste and sand. But this did not end the struggle. The bird,\r\ncroaking horridly, flew at the prostrate bill-poster, and the sand\r\nwhirled into a pillar above its terrible wings. Scarcely knowing what\r\nI was about, I raised my rifle and fired twice. A scream echoed each\r\nshot, and the bird rose heavily in a shower of sand; but two bullets\r\nwere embedded in that mass of foul feathers, and I saw the wires and\r\nscarlet tape uncoiling on the sand at my feet. In an instant I seized\r\nthem and passed the ends around a cedar-tree, hooking the clasps\r\ntight. Then I cast one swift glance upward, where the bird wheeled,\r\nscreeching, anchored like a kite to the pallium wires; and I hurried\r\non across the dunes, the shells cutting my feet and the bushes tearing\r\nmy wet swimming-suit, until I dripped with blood from shoulder to\r\nankle. Out in the ocean the carcass of the thermosaurus floated, claws\r\noutspread, belly glistening in the gray light, and over him circled\r\ntwo birds. As I reached the shelter I knelt and fired into the mass of\r\nscales, and at my first shot a horrible thing occurred--the\r\nlizard-like head writhed, the slitted yellow eyes sliding open from\r\nthe film that covered them. A shudder passed across the undulating\r\nbody, the great scaled belly heaved, and one leg feebly clawed at the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"The thing was still alive!\r\n\r\n\"Crushing back the horror that almost paralyzed my hands, I planted\r\nshot after shot into the quivering reptile, while it writhed and\r\nclawed, striving to turn over and dive; and at each shot the black\r\nblood spurted in long, slim jets across the water. And now Daisy was\r\nat my side, pale and determined, swiftly clasping each tape-marked\r\nwire to the iron rings in the circle around us. Twice I filled the\r\nmagazine from my belt, and twice I poured streams of steel-tipped\r\nbullets into the scaled mass, twisting and shuddering on the sea.\r\nSuddenly the birds steered towards us. I felt the wind from their vast\r\nwings. I saw the feathers erect, vibrating. I saw the spread claws\r\noutstretched, and I struck furiously at them, crying to Daisy to run\r\ninto the iron shelter. Backing, swinging my clubbed rifle, I\r\nretreated, but I tripped across one of the taut pallium wires, and in\r\nan instant the hideous birds were on me, and the bone in my forearm\r\nsnapped like a pipe-stem at a blow from their wings. Twice I struggled\r\nto my knees, blinded with blood, confused, almost fainting; then I\r\nfell again, rolling into the mouth of the iron boiler.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When I struggled back to consciousness Daisy knelt silently beside\r\nme, while Captain McPeek and Professor Holroyd bound up my shattered\r\narm, talking excitedly. The pain made me faint and dizzy. I tried to\r\nspeak and could not. At last they got me to my feet and into the\r\nwagon, and Daisy came, too, and crouched beside me, wrapped in\r\noilskins to her eyes. Fatigue, lack of food, and excitement had\r\ncombined with wounds and broken bones to extinguish the last atom of\r\nstrength in my body; but my mind was clear enough to understand that\r\nthe trouble was over and the thermosaurus safe.\r\n\r\n\"I heard McPeek say that one of the birds that I had anchored to a\r\ncedar-tree had torn loose from the bullets and had winged its way\r\nheavily out to sea. The professor answered: 'Yes, the ekaf-bird; the\r\nothers were ool-ylliks. I'd have given my right arm to have secured\r\nthem.' Then for a time I heard no more; but the jolting of the wagon\r\nover the dunes roused me to keenest pain, and I held out my right hand\r\nto Daisy. She clasped it in both of hers, and kissed it again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There is little more to add, I think. Professor Bruce Stoddard's\r\nscientific pamphlet will be published soon, to be followed by\r\nProfessor Holroyd's sixteen volumes. In a few days the stuffed and\r\nmounted thermosaurus will be placed on free public exhibition in the\r\narena of Madison Square Garden, the only building in the city large\r\nenough to contain the body of this immense winged reptile.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young man hesitated, looking long and earnestly at Miss Barrison.\r\n\r\n\"Did you marry her?\" she asked, softly.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't believe it,\" said the young man, earnestly--\"you\r\nwouldn't believe it, after all that happened, if I should tell you\r\nthat she married Professor Bruce Stoddard, of Columbia--would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I would,\" said Miss Barrison. \"You never can tell what a girl\r\nwill do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That story of yours,\" I said, \"is to me the most wonderful and\r\nvaluable contribution to nature study that it has ever been my fortune\r\nto listen to. You are fitted to write; it is your sacred mission to\r\nproduce. Are you going to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am writing,\" said the young man, quietly, \"a nature book. Sir Peter\r\nGrebe's magnificent monograph on the speckled titmouse inspired me.\r\nBut nature study is not what I have chosen as my life's mission.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked dreamily across at Miss Barrison. \"No, not natural\r\nphenomena,\" he repeated, \"but unnatural phenomena. What Professor\r\nHyssop has done for Columbia, I shall attempt to do for Harvard. In\r\nfact, I have already accepted the chair of Psychical Phenomena at\r\nCambridge.\"\r\n\r\nI gazed upon him with intense respect.\r\n\r\n\"A personal experience revealed to me my life's work,\" he, went on,\r\nthoughtfully stroking his blond mustache. \"If Miss Barrison would care\r\nto hear it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please tell it,\" she said, sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to relate it clothed in that artificial garb known as\r\nliterary style,\" he explained, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" I said, \"I never noticed any style at all in your\r\nstory of the thermosaurus.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gratefully, and passed his hand over his face; a far-away\r\nexpression came into his eyes, and he slowly began, hesitating, as\r\nthough talking to himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was high noon in the city of Antwerp. From slender steeples\r\nfloated the mellow music of the Flemish bells, and in the spire of the\r\ngreat cathedral across the square the cracked chimes clashed discords\r\nuntil my ears ached.\r\n\r\n\"When the fiend in the cathedral had jerked the last tuneless clang\r\nfrom the chimes, I removed my fingers from my ears and sat down at one\r\nof the iron tables in the court. A waiter, with his face shaved blue,\r\nbrought me a bottle of Rhine wine, a tumbler of cracked ice, and a\r\nsiphon.\r\n\r\n\"'Does monsieur desire anything else?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes--the head of the cathedral bell-ringer; bring it with vinegar\r\nand potatoes,' I said, bitterly. Then I began to ponder on my\r\ngreat-aunt and the Crimson Diamond.\r\n\r\n\"The white walls of the Hôtel St. Antoine rose in a rectangle around\r\nthe sunny court, casting long shadows across the basin of the\r\nfountain. The strip of blue overhead was cloudless. Sparrows twittered\r\nunder the eaves the yellow awnings fluttered, the flowers swayed in\r\nthe summer breeze, and the jet of the fountain splashed among the\r\nwater-plants. On the sunny side of the piazza the tables were vacant;\r\non the shady side I was lazily aware that the tables behind me were\r\noccupied, but I was indifferent as to their occupants, partly because\r\nI shunned all tourists, partly because I was thinking of my\r\ngreat-aunt.\r\n\r\n\"Most old ladies are eccentric, but there is a limit, and my\r\ngreat-aunt had overstepped it. I had believed her to be wealthy--she\r\ndied bankrupt. Still, I knew there was one thing she did possess, and\r\nthat was the famous Crimson Diamond. Now, of course, you know who my\r\ngreat-aunt was.\r\n\r\n\"Excepting the Koh-i-noor and the Regent, this enormous and unique\r\nstone was, as everybody knows, the most valuable gem in existence. Any\r\nordinary person would have placed that diamond in a safe-deposit. My\r\ngreat-aunt did nothing of the kind. She kept it in a small velvet bag,\r\nwhich she carried about her neck. She never took it off, but wore it\r\ndangling openly on her heavy silk gown.\r\n\r\n\"In this same bag she also carried dried catnip-leaves, of which she\r\nwas inordinately fond. Nobody but myself, her only living relative,\r\nknew that the Crimson Diamond lay among the sprigs of catnip in the\r\nlittle velvet bag.\r\n\r\n\"'Harold,' she would say, 'do you think I'm a fool? If I place the\r\nCrimson Diamond in any safe-deposit vault in New York, somebody will\r\nsteal it, sooner or later.' Then she would nibble a sprig of catnip\r\nand peer cunningly at me. I loathed the odor of catnip and she knew\r\nit. I also loathed cats. This also she knew, and of course surrounded\r\nherself with a dozen. Poor old lady! One day she was found dead in her\r\nbed in her apartments at the Waldorf. The doctor said she died from\r\nnatural causes. The only other occupant of her sleeping-room was a\r\ncat. The cat fled when we broke open the door, and I heard that she\r\nwas received and cherished by some eccentric people in a neighboring\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\"Now, although my great-aunt's death was due to purely natural causes,\r\nthere was one very startling and disagreeable feature of the case. The\r\nvelvet bag containing the Crimson Diamond had disappeared. Every inch\r\nof the apartment was searched, the floors torn up, the walls\r\ndismantled, but the Crimson Diamond had vanished. Chief of Police\r\nConlon detailed four of his best men on the case, and, as I had\r\nnothing better to do, I enrolled myself as a volunteer. I also offered\r\n$25,000 reward for the recovery of the gem. All New York was agog.\r\n\r\n\"The case seemed hopeless enough, although there were five of us after\r\nthe thief. McFarlane was in London, and had been for a month, but\r\nScotland Yard could give him no help, and the last I heard of him he\r\nwas roaming through Surrey after a man with a white spot in his hair.\r\nHarrison had gone to Paris. He kept writing me that clews were plenty\r\nand the scent hot, but as Dennet, in Berlin, and Clancy, in Vienna,\r\nwrote me the same thing, I began to doubt these gentlemen's ability.\r\n\r\n\"'You say,' I answered Harrison, 'that the fellow is a Frenchman, and\r\nthat he is now concealed in Paris; but Dennet writes me by the same\r\nmail that the thief is undoubtedly a German, and was seen yesterday in\r\nBerlin. To-day I received a letter from Clancy, assuring me that\r\nVienna holds the culprit, and that he is an Austrian from Trieste.\r\nNow, for Heaven's sake,' I ended, 'let me alone and stop writing me\r\nletters until you have something to write about.'\r\n\r\n\"The night-clerk at the Waldorf had furnished us with our first clew.\r\nOn the night of my aunt's death he had seen a tall, grave-faced man\r\nhurriedly leave the hotel. As the man passed the desk he removed his\r\nhat and mopped his forehead, and the night-clerk noticed that in the\r\nmiddle of his head there was a patch of hair as white as snow.\r\n\r\n\"We worked this clew for all it was worth, and, a month later, I\r\nreceived a cable despatch from Paris, saying that a man answering to\r\nthe description of the Waldorf suspect had offered an enormous crimson\r\ndiamond for sale to a jeweller in the Palais Royal. Unfortunately the\r\nfellow took fright and disappeared before the jeweller could send for\r\nthe police, and since that time McFarlane in London, Harrison in\r\nParis, Dennet in Berlin, and Clancy in Vienna had been chasing men\r\nwith white patches on their hair until no gray-headed patriarch in\r\nEurope was free from suspicion. I myself had sleuthed it through\r\nEngland, France, Holland, and Belgium, and now I found myself in\r\nAntwerp at the Hôtel St. Antoine, without a clew that promised\r\nanything except another outrage on some respectable white-haired\r\ncitizen. The case seemed hopeless enough, unless the thief tried again\r\nto sell the gem. Here was our only hope, for, unless he cut the stone\r\ninto smaller ones, he had no more chance of selling it than he would\r\nhave had if he had stolen the Venus of Milo and peddled her about the\r\nRue de Seine. Even were he to cut up the stone, no respectable gem\r\ncollector or jeweller would buy a crimson diamond without first\r\nnotifying me; for although a few red stones are known to collectors,\r\nthe color of the Crimson Diamond was absolutely unique, and there was\r\nlittle probability of an honest mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking of all these things, I sat sipping my Rhine wine in the\r\nshadow of the yellow awnings. A large white cat came sauntering by and\r\nstopped in front of me to perform her toilet, until I wished she would\r\ngo away. After a while she sat up, licked her whiskers, yawned once or\r\ntwice, and was about to stroll on, when, catching sight of me, she\r\nstopped short and looked me squarely in the face. I returned the\r\nattention with a scowl, because I wished to discourage any advances\r\ntowards social intercourse which she might contemplate; but after a\r\nwhile her steady gaze disconcerted me, and I turned to my Rhine wine.\r\nA few minutes later I looked up again. The cat was still eying me.\r\n\r\n\"'Now what the devil is the matter with the animal,' I muttered; 'does\r\nshe recognize in me a relative?'\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps,' observed a man at the next table.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you mean by that?' I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"'What I say,' replied the man at the next table.\r\n\r\n\"I looked him full in the face. He was old and bald and appeared\r\nweak-minded. His age protected his impudence. I turned my back on him.\r\nThen my eyes fell on the cat again. She was still gazing earnestly at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Disgusted that she should take such pointed public notice of me, I\r\nwondered whether other people saw it; I wondered whether there was\r\nanything peculiar in my own personal appearance. How hard the creature\r\nstared! It was most embarrassing.\r\n\r\n\"'What has got into that cat?' I thought. 'It's sheer impudence. It's\r\nan intrusion, and I won't stand it!' The cat did not move. I tried to\r\nstare her out of countenance. It was useless. There was aggressive\r\ninquiry in her yellow eyes. A sensation of uneasiness began to steal\r\nover me--a sensation of embarrassment not unmixed with awe. All cats\r\nlooked alike to me, and yet there was something about this one that\r\nbothered me--something that I could not explain to myself, but which\r\nbegan to occupy me.\r\n\r\n\"She looked familiar--this Antwerp cat. An odd sense of having seen\r\nher before, of having been well acquainted with her in former years,\r\nslowly settled in my mind, and, although I could never remember the\r\ntime when I had not detested cats, I was almost convinced that my\r\nrelations with this Antwerp tabby had once been intimate if not\r\ncordial. I looked more closely at the animal. Then an idea struck\r\nme--an idea which persisted and took definite shape in spite of me. I\r\nstrove to escape from it, to evade it, to stifle and smother it; an\r\ninward struggle ensued which brought the perspiration in beads upon my\r\ncheeks--a struggle short, sharp, decisive. It was useless--useless to\r\ntry to put it from me--this idea so wretchedly bizarre, so grotesque\r\nand fantastic, so utterly inane--it was useless to deny that the cat\r\nbore a distinct resemblance to my great-aunt!\r\n\r\n\"I gazed at her in horror. What enormous eyes the creature had!\r\n\r\n\"'Blood is thicker than water,' said the man at the next table.\r\n\r\n\"'What does he mean by that?' I muttered, angrily, swallowing a\r\ntumbler of Rhine wine and seltzer. But I did not turn. What was the\r\nuse?\r\n\r\n\"'Chattering old imbecile,' I added to myself, and struck a match, for\r\nmy cigar was out; but, as I raised the match to relight it, I\r\nencountered the cat's eyes again. I could not enjoy my cigar with the\r\nanimal staring at me, but I was justly indignant, and I did not intend\r\nto be routed. 'The idea! Forced to leave for a cat!' I sneered. 'We\r\nwill see who will be the one to go!' I tried to give her a jet of\r\nseltzer from the siphon, but the bottle was too nearly empty to carry\r\nfar. Then I attempted to lure her nearer, calling her in French,\r\nGerman, and English, but she did not stir. I did not know the Flemish\r\nfor 'cat.'\r\n\r\n\"'She's got a name, and won't come,' I thought. 'Now, what under the\r\nsun can I call her?'\r\n\r\n\"'Aunty,' suggested the man at the next table.\r\n\r\n\"I sat perfectly still. Could that man have answered my thoughts?--for\r\nI had not spoken aloud. Of course not--it was a coincidence--but a\r\nvery disgusting one.\r\n\r\n\"'Aunty,' I repeated, mechanically, 'aunty, aunty--good gracious, how\r\nhorribly human that cat looks!' Then, somehow or other, Shakespeare's\r\nwords crept into my head and I found myself repeating: 'The soul of my\r\ngrandam might haply inhabit a bird; the soul of--nonsense!' I\r\ngrowled--'it isn't printed correctly! One might possibly say, speaking\r\nin poetical metaphor, that the soul of a bird might haply inhabit\r\none's grandam--' I stopped short, flushing painfully. 'What awful\r\nrot!' I murmured, and lighted another cigar. The cat was still\r\nstaring; the cigar went out. I grew more and more nervous. 'What rot!'\r\nI repeated. 'Pythagoras must have been an ass, but I do believe there\r\nare plenty of asses alive to-day who swallow that sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who knows?' sighed the man at the next table, and I sprang to my\r\nfeet and wheeled about. But I only caught a glimpse of a pair of\r\nfrayed coat-tails and a bald head vanishing into the dining-room. I\r\nsat down again, thoroughly indignant. A moment later the cat got up\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daylight was fading in the city of Antwerp. Down into the sea sank\r\nthe sun, tinting the vast horizon with flakes of crimson, and touching\r\nwith rich deep undertones the tossing waters of the Scheldt. Its glow\r\nfell like a rosy mantle over red-tiled roofs and meadows; and through\r\nthe haze the spires of twenty churches pierced the air like sharp,\r\ngilded flames. To the west and south the green plains, over which the\r\nSpanish armies tramped so long ago, stretched away until they met the\r\nsky; the enchantment of the after-glow had turned old Antwerp into\r\nfairy-land; and sea and sky and plain were beautiful and vague as the\r\nnight-mists floating in the moats below.\r\n\r\n\"Along the sea-wall from the Rubens Gate all Antwerp strolled, and\r\nchattered, and flirted, and sipped their Flemish wines from slender\r\nFlemish glasses, or gossiped over krugs of foaming beer.\r\n\r\n\"From the Scheldt came the cries of sailors, the creaking of cordage,\r\nand the puff! puff! of the ferry-boats. On the bastions of the\r\nfortress opposite, a bugler was standing. Twice the mellow notes of\r\nthe bugle came faintly over the water, then a great gun thundered from\r\nthe ramparts, and the Belgian flag fluttered along the lanyards to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"I leaned listlessly on the sea-wall and looked down at the Scheldt\r\nbelow. A battery of artillery was embarking for the fortress. The\r\ntublike transport lay hissing and whistling in the slip, and the\r\nstamping of horses, the rumbling of gun and caisson, and the sharp\r\ncries of the officers came plainly to the ear.\r\n\r\n\"When the last caisson was aboard and stowed, and the last trooper had\r\nsprung jingling to the deck, the transport puffed out into the\r\nScheldt, and I turned away through the throng of promenaders; and\r\nfound a little table on the terrace, just outside of the pretty café.\r\nAnd as I sat down I became aware of a girl at the next table--a girl\r\nall in white--the most ravishingly and distractingly pretty girl that\r\nI had ever seen. In the agitation of the moment I forgot my name, my\r\nfortune, my aunt, and the Crimson Diamond--all these I forgot in a\r\npurely human impulse to see clearly; and to that end I removed my\r\nmonocle from my left eye. Some moments later I came to myself and\r\nfeebly replaced it. It was too late; the mischief was done. I was not\r\naware at first of the exact state of my feelings--for I had never been\r\nin love more than three or four times in all my life--but I did know\r\nthat at her request I would have been proud to stand on my head, or\r\nturn a flip-flap into the Scheldt.\r\n\r\n\"I did not stare at her, but I managed to see her most of the time\r\nwhen her eyes were in another direction. I found myself drinking\r\nsomething which a waiter brought, presumably upon an order which I did\r\nnot remember having given. Later I noticed that it was a loathsome\r\ndrink which the Belgians call 'American grog,' but I swallowed it and\r\nlighted a cigarette. As the fragrant cloud rose in the air, a voice,\r\nwhich I recognized with a chill, broke, into my dream of enchantment.\r\nCould _he_ have been there all the while--there sitting beside that\r\nvision in white? His hat was off, and the ocean-breezes whispered\r\nabout his bald head. His frayed coat-tails were folded carefully over\r\nhis knees, and between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he\r\nbalanced a bad cigar. He looked at me in a mildly cheerful way, and\r\nsaid, 'I know now.'\r\n\r\n\"'Know what?' I asked, thinking it better to humor him, for I was\r\nconvinced that he was mad.\r\n\r\n\"'I know why cats bite.'\r\n\r\n\"This was startling. I hadn't an idea what to say.\r\n\r\n\"'I know why,' he repeated; 'can you guess why?' There was a covert\r\ntone of triumph in his voice and he smiled encouragement. 'Come, try\r\nand guess,' he urged.\r\n\r\n\"I told him that I was unequal to problems.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, young man,' he continued, folding his coat-tails closely\r\nabout his legs--'try to reason it out: why should cats bite? Don't you\r\nknow? I do.'\r\n\r\n\"He looked at me anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"'You take no interest in this problem?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then why do you not ask me why?' he said, looking vaguely\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' I said, in desperation, 'why do cats bite?--hang it all!' I\r\nthought, 'it's like a burned-cork show, and I'm Mr. Bones and he's\r\nTambo!'\r\n\r\n\"Then he smiled gently. 'Young man,' he said, 'cats bite because they\r\nfeed on catnip. I have reasoned it out.'\r\n\r\n\"I stared at him in blank astonishment. Was this benevolent-looking\r\nold party poking fun at me? Was he paying me up for the morning's\r\nsnub? Was he a malignant and revengeful old party, or was he merely\r\nfeeble-minded? Who might he be? What was he doing here in\r\nAntwerp--what was he doing now?--for the bald one had turned\r\nfamiliarly to the beautiful girl in white.\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina,' he said, 'do you feel chilly?' The girl shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"'Not in the least, papa.'\r\n\r\n\"'Her father!' I thought--'her father!' Thank God she did not say\r\n'popper'!\r\n\r\n\"'I have been to the Zoo to-day,' announced the bald one, turning\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, indeed,' I observed; 'er--I trust you enjoyed it.'\r\n\r\n\"'I have been contemplating the apes,' he continued, dreamily. 'Yes,\r\ncontemplating the apes.'\r\n\r\n\"I tried to look interested.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, the apes,' he murmured, fixing his mild eyes on me. Then he\r\nleaned towards me confidentially and whispered, 'Can you tell me what\r\na monkey thinks?'\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot,' I replied, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah,' he sighed, sinking back in his chair, and patting the slender\r\nhand of the girl beside him--'ah, who can tell what a monkey thinks?'\r\nHis gentle face lulled my suspicions, and I replied, very gravely:\r\n\r\n\"'Who can tell whether they think at all?'\r\n\r\n\"'True, true! Who can tell whether they think at all; and if they do\r\nthink, ah! who can tell what they think?'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' I began, 'if you can't tell whether they think at all, what's\r\nthe use of trying to conjecture what they _would_ think if they _did_\r\nthink?'\r\n\r\n\"He raised his hand in deprecation. 'Ah, it is exactly that which is\r\nof such absorbing interest--exactly that! It is the abstruseness of\r\nthe proposition which stimulates research--which stirs profoundly the\r\nbrain of the thinking world. The question is of vital and instant\r\nimportance. Possibly you have already formed an opinion.'\r\n\r\n\"I admitted that I had thought but little on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"'I doubt,' he continued, swathing his knees in his coat-tails--'I\r\ndoubt whether you have given much attention to the subject lately\r\ndiscussed by the Boston Dodo Society of Pythagorean Research.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am not sure,' I said, politely, 'that I recall that particular\r\ndiscussion. May I ask what was the question brought up?'\r\n\r\n\"'The Felis domestica question.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, that must indeed be interesting! And--er--what may be the Felis\r\ndo--do--'\r\n\r\n\"'Domestica--not dodo. Felis domestica, the common or garden cat.'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed,' I murmured.\r\n\r\n\"'You are not listening,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"I only half heard him. I could not turn my eyes from his daughter's\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"'Cat!' shouted the bald one, and I almost leaped from my chair. 'Are\r\nyou deaf?' he inquired, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"'No--oh no!' I replied, coloring with confusion; 'you were--pardon\r\nme--you were--er--speaking of the dodo. Extraordinary bird that--'\r\n\r\n\"'I was not discussing the dodo,' he sighed. 'I was speaking of cats.'\r\n\r\n\"'Of course,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'The question is,' he continued, twisting his frayed coat-tails into\r\na sort of rope--'the question is, how are we to ameliorate the present\r\ncondition and social status of our domestic cats?'\r\n\r\n\"'Feed 'em,' I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"He raised both hands. They were eloquent with patient expostulation.\r\n'I mean their spiritual condition,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"I nodded, but my eyes reverted to that exquisite face. She sat\r\nsilent, her eyes fixed on the waning flecks of color in the western\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' repeated the bald one, 'the spiritual welfare of our domestic\r\ncats.'\r\n\r\n\"'Toms and tabbies?' I murmured.\r\n\r\n\"'Exactly,' he said, tying a large knot in his coat-tails.\r\n\r\n\"'You will ruin your coat,' I observed.\r\n\r\n\"'Papa!' exclaimed the girl, turning in dismay, as that gentleman gave\r\na guilty start, 'stop it at once!'\r\n\r\n\"He smiled apologetically and made a feeble attempt to conceal his\r\ncoat-tails.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear,' he said, with gentle deprecation, 'I am so\r\nabsent-minded--I always do it in the heat of argument.'\r\n\r\n\"The girl rose, and, bending over her untidy parent, deftly untied the\r\nknot in his flapping coat. When he was disentangled, she sat down and\r\nsaid, with a ghost of a smile, 'He is so very absent-minded.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your father is evidently a great student,' I ventured, pleasantly.\r\nHow I pitied her, tied to this old lunatic!\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, he is a great student,' she said, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"'I am,' he murmured; 'that's what makes me so absent-minded. I often\r\ngo to bed and forget to sleep.' Then, looking at me, he asked me my\r\nname, adding, with a bow, that his name was P. Royal Wyeth, Professor\r\nof Pythagorean Research and Abstruse Paradox.\r\n\r\n\"'My first name is Penny--named after Professor Penny, of Harvard,' he\r\nsaid; 'but I seldom use my first name in connection with my second, as\r\nthe combination suggests a household remedy of penetrating odor.'\r\n\r\n\"'My name is Kensett,' I said, 'Harold Kensett, of New York.'\r\n\r\n\"'Student?'\r\n\r\n\"'Er--a little.'\r\n\r\n\"'Student of diamonds?'\r\n\r\n\"I smiled. 'Oh, I see you know who my great-aunt was,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'I know her,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah--perhaps you are unaware that my great-aunt is not now living.'\r\n\r\n\"'I know her,' he repeated, obstinately.\r\n\r\n\"I bowed. What a crank he was!\r\n\r\n\"'What do you study? You don't fiddle away all your time, do you?' he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Now that was just what I did, but I was not pleased to have Miss\r\nWyeth know it. Although my time was chiefly spent in killing time, I\r\nhad once, in a fit of energy, succeeded in writing some verses 'To a\r\nTomtit,' so I evaded a humiliating confession by saying that I had\r\ndone a little work in ornithology.\r\n\r\n\"'Good!' cried the professor, beaming all over. 'I knew you were a\r\nfellow-scientist. Possibly you are a brother-member of the Boston\r\nDodo Society of Pythagorean Research. Are you a dodo?'\r\n\r\n\"I shook my head. 'No, I am not a dodo.'\r\n\r\n\"'Only a jay?'\r\n\r\n\"'A--what?' I said, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"'A jay. We call the members of the Junior Ornithological Jay Society\r\nof New York, jays, just as we refer to ourselves as dodos. Are you not\r\neven a jay?'\r\n\r\n\"'I am not,' I said, watching him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"'I must convert you, I see,' said the professor, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm afraid I do not approve of Pythagorean research,' I began, but\r\nthe beautiful Miss Wyeth turned to me very seriously, and, looking me\r\nfrankly in the eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\"'I trust you will be open to conviction.'\r\n\r\n\"'Good Lord!' I thought. 'Can she be another lunatic?' I looked at her\r\nsteadily. What a little beauty she was! She also, then, belonged to\r\nthe Pythagoreans--a sect I despised. Everybody knows all about the\r\nPythagorean craze, its rise in Boston, its rapid spread, and its\r\nsubsequent consolidation with mental and Christian science, theosophy,\r\nhypnotism, the Salvation Army, the Shakers, the Dunkards, and the\r\nmind-cure cult, upon a business basis. I had hitherto regarded all\r\nPythagoreans with the same scornful indifference which I accorded to\r\nthe faith-curists; being a member of no particular church, I was\r\nscarcely prepared to take any of them seriously. Least of all did I\r\napprove of the 'business basis,' and I looked very much askance indeed\r\nat the 'Scientific and Religious Trust Company,' duly incorporated and\r\ngenerally known as the Pythagorean Trust, which, consolidating with\r\nmind-curists, faith-curists, and other flourishing salvation\r\nsyndicates, actually claimed a place among ordinary trusts, and at the\r\nsame time pretended to a control over man's future life. No, I could\r\nnever listen--I was ashamed of even entertaining the notion, and I\r\nshook my head.\r\n\r\n\"'No, Miss Wyeth, I am afraid I do not care to listen to any reasoning\r\non this subject.'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't you believe in Pythagoras?' demanded the professor, subduing\r\nhis excitement with difficulty, and adding another knot to his\r\ncoat-tails.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I said, 'I do not.'\r\n\r\n\"'How do you know you don't?' inquired the professor.\r\n\r\n\"'Because,' I said, firmly, 'it is nonsense to say that the soul of a\r\nhuman being can inhabit a hen!'\r\n\r\n\"'Put it in a more simplified form!' insisted the professor. 'Do you\r\nbelieve that the soul of a hen can inhabit a human being?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I don't!'\r\n\r\n\"'Did you ever hear of a hen-pecked man?' cried the professor, his\r\nvoice ending in a shout.\r\n\r\n\"I nodded, intensely annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you listen to reason, then?' he continued, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I began, but I caught Miss Wyeth's blue eyes fixed on mine with\r\nan expression so sad, so sweetly appealing, that I faltered.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, I will listen,' I said, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you become my pupil?' insisted the professor.\r\n\r\n\"I was shocked to find myself wavering, but my eyes were looking into\r\nhers, and I could not disobey what I read there. The longer I looked\r\nthe greater inclination I felt to waver. I saw that I was going to\r\ngive in, and, strangest of all, my conscience did not trouble me. I\r\nfelt it coming--a sort of mild exhilaration took possession of me. For\r\nthe first time in my life I became reckless--I even gloried in my\r\nrecklessness.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, yes,' I cried, leaning eagerly across the table, 'I shall be\r\nglad--delighted! Will you take me as your pupil?' My single eye-glass\r\nfell from its position unheeded. 'Take me! Oh, will you take me?' I\r\ncried. Instead of answering, the professor blinked rapidly at me for a\r\nmoment. I imagined his eyes had grown bigger, and were assuming a\r\ngreenish tinge. The corners of his mouth began to quiver, emitting\r\nqueer, caressing little noises, and he rapidly added knot after knot\r\nto his twitching coat-tails. Suddenly he bent forward across the table\r\nuntil his nose almost touched mine. The pupils of his eyes expanded,\r\nthe iris assuming a beautiful, changing, golden-green tinge, and his\r\ncoat-tails switched violently. Then he began to mew.\r\n\r\n\"I strove to rouse myself from my paralysis--I tried to shrink back,\r\nfor I felt the end of his cold nose touch mine. I could not move. The\r\ncry of terror died in my straining throat, my hands tightened\r\nconvulsively; I was incapable of speech or motion. At the same time my\r\nbrain became wonderfully clear. I began to remember everything that\r\nhad ever happened to me--everything that I had ever done or said. I\r\neven remembered things that I had neither done nor said; I recalled\r\ndistinctly much that had never happened. How fresh and strong my\r\nmemory! The past was like a mirror, crystal clear, and there, in\r\nglorious tints and hues, the scenes of my childhood grew and glowed\r\nand faded, and gave place to newer and more splendid scenes. For a\r\nmoment the episode of the cat at the Hôtel St. Antoine flashed across\r\nmy mind. When it vanished a chilly stupor slowly clouded my brain; the\r\nscenes, the memories, the brilliant colors, faded, leaving me\r\nenveloped in a gray vapor, through which the two great eyes of the\r\nprofessor twinkled with a murky light. A peculiar longing stirred\r\nme--a strange yearning for something, I knew not what--but, oh! how I\r\nlonged and yearned for it! Slowly this indefinite, incomprehensible\r\nlonging became a living pain. Ah, how I suffered, and how the vapors\r\nseemed to crowd around me! Then, as at a great distance, I heard her\r\nvoice, sweet, imperative:\r\n\r\n\"'Mew!' she said.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment I seemed to see the interior of my own skull, lighted as\r\nby a flash of fire; the rolling eyeballs, veined in scarlet, the\r\nglistening muscles quivering along the jaw, the humid masses of the\r\nconvoluted brain; then awful darkness--a darkness almost tangible--an\r\nutter blackness, through which now seemed to creep a thin, silver\r\nthread, like a river crawling across a world--like a thought gliding\r\nto the brain--like a song, a thin, sharp song which some distant voice\r\nwas singing--which I was singing.\r\n\r\n\"And I knew that I was mewing!\r\n\r\n\"I threw myself back in my chair and mewed with all my heart. Oh, that\r\nheavy load which was lifted from my breast! How good, how satisfying\r\nit was to mew! And how I did miaul and yowl!\r\n\r\n\"I gave myself up to it, heart and soul; my whole being thrilled with\r\nthe passionate outpourings of a spirit freed. My voice trembled in the\r\nupper bars of a feline love-song, quavered, descended, swelling again\r\ninto an intimation that I brooked no rival, and ended with a\r\nmagnificent crescendo.\r\n\r\n\"I finished, somewhat abashed, and glanced askance at the professor\r\nand his daughter, but the one sat nonchalantly disentangling his\r\ncoat-tails, and the other was apparently absorbed in the distant\r\nlandscape. Evidently they did not consider me ridiculous. Flushing\r\npainfully, I turned in my chair to see how my grewsome solo had\r\naffected the people on the terrace. Nobody even looked at me. This,\r\nhowever, gave me little comfort, for, as I began to realize what I had\r\ndone, my mortification and rage knew no bounds. I was ready to die of\r\nshame. What on earth had induced me to mew? I looked wildly about for\r\nescape--I would leap up--rush home to bury my burning face in my\r\npillows, and, later, in the friendly cabin of a homeward-bound\r\nsteamer. I would fly--fly at once! Woe to the man who blocked my way!\r\nI started to my feet, but at that moment I caught Miss Wyeth's eyes\r\nfixed on mine.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't go,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"What in Heaven's name lay in those blue eyes? I slowly sank back into\r\nmy chair.\r\n\r\n\"Then the professor spoke: 'Wilhelmina, I have just received a\r\ndespatch.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where from, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"'From India. I'm going at once.'\r\n\r\n\"She nodded her head, without turning her eyes from the sea. 'Is it\r\nimportant, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"'I should say so. The cashier of the local trust has compromised an\r\nastral body, and has squandered on her all our funds, including a lot\r\nof first mortgages on Nirvana. I suppose he's been dabbling in futures\r\nand is short in his accounts. I sha'n't be gone long.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then, good-night, papa,' she said, kissing him; 'try to be back by\r\neleven.' I sat stupidly staring at them.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, it's only to Bombay--I sha'n't go to Thibet\r\nto-night--good-night, my dear,' said the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Then a singular thing occurred. The professor had at last succeeded\r\nin disentangling his coat-tails, and now, jamming his hat over his\r\nears, and waving his arms with a batlike motion, he climbed upon the\r\nseat of his chair and ejaculated the word 'Presto!' Then I found my\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"'Stop him!' I cried, in terror.\r\n\r\n\"'Presto! Presto!' shouted the professor, balancing himself on the\r\nedge of his chair and waving his arms majestically, as if preparing\r\nfor a sudden flight across the Scheldt; and, firmly convinced that he\r\nnot only meditated it, but was perfectly capable of attempting it, I\r\ncovered my eyes with my hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you ill, Mr. Kensett?' asked the girl, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I raised my head indignantly. 'Not at all, Miss Wyeth, only I'll bid\r\nyou good-evening, for this is the nineteenth century, and I'm a\r\nChristian.'\r\n\r\n\"'So am I,' she said. 'So is my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'The devil he is,' I thought.\r\n\r\n\"Her next words made me jump.\r\n\r\n\"'Please do not be profane, Mr. Kensett.'\r\n\r\n\"How did she know I was profane? I had not spoken a word! Could it be\r\npossible she was able to read my thoughts? This was too much, and I\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\"'I have the honor to bid you good-evening,' I began, and reluctantly\r\nturned to include the professor, expecting to see that gentleman\r\nbalancing himself on his chair. The professor's chair was empty.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' said the girl, smiling, 'my father has gone.'\r\n\r\n\"'Gone! Where?'\r\n\r\n\"'To--to India, I believe.'\r\n\r\n\"I sank helplessly into my own chair.\r\n\r\n\"'I do not think he will stay very long--he promised to return by\r\neleven,' she said, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"I tried to realize the purport of it all. 'Gone to India? Gone! How?\r\nOn a broomstick? Good Heavens,' I murmured, 'am I insane?'\r\n\r\n\"'Perfectly,' she said, 'and I am tired; you may take me back to the\r\nhotel.'\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely heard her; I was feebly attempting to gather up my numbed\r\nwits. Slowly I began to comprehend the situation, to review the\r\nstartling and humiliating events of the day. At noon, in the court of\r\nthe Hôtel St. Antoine, I had been annoyed by a man and a cat. I had\r\nretired to my own room and had slept until dinner. In the evening I\r\nmet two tourists on the sea-wall promenade. I had been beguiled into\r\nconversation--yes, into intimacy with these two tourists! I had had\r\nthe intention of embracing the faith of Pythagoras! Then I had mewed\r\nlike a cat with all the strength of my lungs. Now the male tourist\r\nvanishes--and leaves me in charge of the female tourist, alone and at\r\nnight in a strange city! And now the female tourist proposes that I\r\ntake her home!\r\n\r\n\"With a remnant of self-possession I groped for my eye-glass, seized\r\nit, screwed it firmly into my eye, and looked long and earnestly at\r\nthe girl. As I looked, my eyes softened, my monacle dropped, and I\r\nforgot everything in the beauty and purity of the face before me. My\r\nheart began to beat against my stiff, white waistcoat. Had I\r\ndared--yes, dared to think of this wondrous little beauty as a female\r\ntourist? Her pale, sweet face, turned towards the sea, seemed to cast\r\na spell upon the night. How loud my heart was beating! The yellow moon\r\nfloated, half dipping in the sea, flooding land and water with\r\nenchanted lights. Wind and wave seemed to feel the spell of her eyes,\r\nfor the breeze died away, the heaving Scheldt tossed noiselessly, and\r\nthe dark Dutch luggers swung idly on the tide with every sail adroop.\r\n\r\n\"A sudden hush fell over land and water, the voices on the promenade\r\nwere stilled; little by little the shadowy throng, the terrace, the\r\nsea itself vanished, and I only saw her face, shadowed against the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as if I had drifted miles above the earth, through all\r\nspace and eternity, and there was naught between me and high heaven\r\nbut that white face. Ah, how I loved her! I knew it--I never doubted\r\nit. Could years of passionate adoration touch her heart--her little\r\nheart, now beating so calmly with no thought of love to startle it\r\nfrom its quiet and send it fluttering against the gentle breast? In\r\nher lap her clasped hands tightened--her eyelids drooped as though\r\nsome pleasant thought was passing. I saw the color dye her temples, I\r\nsaw the blue eyes turn, half frightened, to my own, I saw--and I knew\r\nshe had read my thoughts. Then we both rose, side by side, and she was\r\nweeping softly, yet for my life I dared not speak. She turned away,\r\ntouching her eyes with a bit of lace, and I sprang to her side and\r\noffered her my arm.\r\n\r\n\"'You cannot go back alone,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"She did not take my arm.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you hate me, Miss Wyeth?'\r\n\r\n\"'I am very tired,' she said; 'I must go home.'\r\n\r\n\"'You cannot go alone.'\r\n\r\n\"'I do not care to accept your escort.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then--you send me away?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' she said, in a hard voice. 'You can come if you like.' So I\r\nhumbly attended her to the Hôtel St. Antoine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As we reached the Place Verte and turned into the court of the hotel,\r\nthe sound of the midnight bells swept over the city, and a horse-car\r\njingled slowly by on its last trip to the railroad station.\r\n\r\n\"We passed the fountain, bubbling and splashing in the moonlit court,\r\nand, crossing the square, entered the southern wing of the hotel. At\r\nthe foot of the stairway she leaned for an instant against the\r\nbanisters.\r\n\r\n\"'I am afraid we have walked too fast,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"She turned to me coldly. 'No--conventionalities must be observed. You\r\nwere quite right in escaping as soon as possible.'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' I protested, 'I assure you--'\r\n\r\n\"She gave a little movement of impatience. 'Don't,' she said, 'you\r\ntire me--conventionalities tire me. Be satisfied--nobody has seen\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are cruel,' I said, in a low voice--'what do you think I care\r\nfor conventionalities?'\r\n\r\n\"'You care everything--you care what people think, and you try to do\r\nwhat they say is good form. You never did such an original thing in\r\nyour life as you have just done.'\r\n\r\n\"'You read my thoughts,' I exclaimed, bitterly. 'It is not fair--'\r\n\r\n\"'Fair or not, I know what you consider me--ill-bred, common, pleased\r\nwith any sort of attention. Oh! why should I waste one word--one\r\nthought on you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Wyeth--' I began, but she interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\"'Would you dare tell me what you think of me?--Would you dare tell me\r\nwhat you think of my father?'\r\n\r\n\"I was silent. She turned and mounted two steps of the stairway, then\r\nfaced me again.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think it was for my own pleasure that I permitted myself to\r\nbe left alone with you? Do you imagine that I am flattered by your\r\nattention?--do you venture to think I ever could be? How dared you\r\nthink what you did think there on the sea-wall?'\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot help my thoughts!' I replied.\r\n\r\n\"'You turned on me like a tiger when you awoke from your trance. Do\r\nyou really suppose that you mewed? Are you not aware that my father\r\nhypnotized you?'\r\n\r\n\"'No--I did not know it,' I said. The hot blood tingled in my\r\nfinger-tips, and I looked angrily at her.\r\n\r\n\"'Why do you imagine that I waste my time on you?' she said. 'Your\r\nvanity has answered that question--now let your intelligence answer\r\nit. I am a Pythagorean; I have been chosen to bring in a convert, and\r\nyou were the convert selected for me by the Mahatmas of the\r\nConsolidated Trust Company. I have followed you from New York to\r\nAntwerp, as I was bidden, but now my courage fails, and I shrink from\r\nfulfilling my mission, knowing you to be the type of man you are. If I\r\ncould give it up--if I could only go away--never, never again to see\r\nyou! Ah, I fear they will not permit it!--until my mission is\r\naccomplished. Why was I chosen--I, with a woman's heart and a woman's\r\npride. I--I hate you!'\r\n\r\n\"'I love you,' I said, slowly.\r\n\r\n\"She paled and looked away.\r\n\r\n\"'Answer me,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"Her wide, blue eyes turned back again, and I held them with mine. At\r\nlast she slowly drew a long-stemmed rose from the bunch at her belt,\r\nturned, and mounted the shadowy staircase. For a moment I thought I\r\nsaw her pause on the landing above, but the moonlight was uncertain.\r\nAfter waiting for a long time in vain, I moved away, and in going\r\nraised my hand to my face, but I stopped short, and my heart stopped\r\ntoo, for a moment. In my hand I held a long-stemmed rose.\r\n\r\n\"With my brain in a whirl I crept across the court and mounted the\r\nstairs to my room. Hour after hour I walked the floor, slowly at\r\nfirst, then more rapidly, but it brought no calm to the fierce tumult\r\nof my thoughts, and at last I dropped into a chair before the empty\r\nfireplace, burying my head in my hands.\r\n\r\n\"Uncertain, shocked, and deadly weary, I tried to think--I strove to\r\nbring order out of the chaos in my brain, but I only sat staring at\r\nthe long-stemmed rose. Slowly I began to take a vague pleasure in its\r\nheavy perfume, and once I crushed a leaf between my palms, and,\r\nbending over, drank in the fragrance.\r\n\r\n\"Twice my lamp flickered and went out, and twice, treading softly, I\r\ncrossed the room to relight it. Twice I threw open the door, thinking\r\nthat I heard some sound without. How close the air was!--how heavy and\r\nhot! And what was that strange, subtle odor which had insensibly\r\nfilled the room? It grew stronger and more penetrating, and I began\r\nto dislike it, and to escape it I buried my nose in the half-opened\r\nrose. Horror! The odor came from the rose--and the rose itself was no\r\nlonger a rose--not even a flower now--it was only a bunch of catnip;\r\nand I dashed it to the floor and ground it under my heel.\r\n\r\n\"'Mountebank!' I cried, in a rage. My anger grew cold--and I shivered,\r\ndrawn perforce to the curtained window. Something was there, outside.\r\nI could not hear it, for it made no sound, but I knew it was there,\r\nwatching me. What was it? The damp hair stirred on my head. I touched\r\nthe heavy curtains. Whatever was outside them sprang up, tore at the\r\nwindow, and then rushed away.\r\n\r\n\"Feeling very shaky, I crept to the window, opened it, and leaned out.\r\nThe night was calm. I heard the fountain splashing in the moonlight\r\nand the sea-winds soughing through the palms. Then I closed the window\r\nand turned back into the room; and as I stood there a sudden breeze,\r\nwhich could not have come from without, blew sharply in my face,\r\nextinguishing the candle and sending the long curtains bellying out\r\ninto the room. The lamp on the table flashed and smoked and sputtered;\r\nthe room was littered with flying papers and catnip leaves. Then the\r\nstrange wind died away, and somewhere in the night a cat snarled.\r\n\r\n\"I turned desperately to my trunk and flung it open. Into it I threw\r\neverything I owned, pell-mell, closed the lid, locked it, and, seizing\r\nmy mackintosh and travelling-bag, ran down the stairs, crossed the\r\ncourt, and entered the night-office of the hotel. There I called up\r\nthe sleepy clerk, settled my reckoning, and sent a porter for a cab.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' I said, 'what time does the next train leave?'\r\n\r\n\"'The next train for where?'\r\n\r\n\"'Anywhere!'\r\n\r\n\"The clerk locked the safe, and, carefully keeping the desk between\r\nhimself and me, motioned the office-boy to look at the time-tables.\r\n\r\n\"'Next train, 2.10. Brussels--Paris,' read the boy.\r\n\r\n\"At that moment the cab rattled up by the curbstone, and I sprang in\r\nwhile the porter tossed my traps on top. Away we bumped over the stony\r\npavement, past street after street lighted dimly by tall gas-lamps,\r\nand alley after alley brilliant with the glare of villanous all-night\r\ncafé-concerts, and then, turning, we rumbled past the Circus and the\r\nEldorado, and at last stopped with a jolt before the Brussels station.\r\n\r\n\"I had not a moment to lose. 'Paris!' I cried--'first-class!' and,\r\npocketing the book of coupons, hurried across the platform to where\r\nthe Brussels train lay. A guard came running up, flung open the door\r\nof a first-class carriage, slammed and locked it after I had jumped\r\nin, and the long train glided from the arched station out into the\r\nstarlit morning.\r\n\r\n\"I was all alone in the compartment. The wretched lamp in the roof\r\nflickered dimly, scarcely lighting the stuffy box. I could not see to\r\nread my time-table, so I wrapped my legs in the travelling-rug and lay\r\nback, staring out into the misty morning. Trees, walls,\r\ntelegraph-poles flashed past, and the cinders drove in showers against\r\nthe rattling windows. I slept at times, fitfully, and once, springing\r\nup, peered sharply at the opposite seat, possessed with the idea that\r\nsomebody was there.\r\n\r\n\"When the train reached Brussels I was sound asleep, and the guard\r\nawoke me with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"'Breakfast, sir?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Anything,' I sighed, and stepped out to the platform, rubbing my\r\nlegs and shivering. The other passengers were already breakfasting in\r\nthe station café, and I joined them and managed to swallow a cup of\r\ncoffee and a roll.\r\n\r\n\"The morning broke gray and cloudy, and I bundled myself into my\r\nmackintosh for a tramp along the platform. Up and down I stamped,\r\npuffing a cigar, and digging my hands deep in my pockets, while the\r\nother passengers huddled into the warmer compartments of the train or\r\nstood watching the luggage being lifted into the forward\r\nmail-carriage. The wait was very long; the hands of the great clock\r\npointed to six, and still the train lay motionless along the platform.\r\nI approached a guard and asked him whether anything was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"'Accident on the line,' he replied; 'monsieur had better go to his\r\ncompartment and try to sleep, for we may be delayed until noon.'\r\n\r\n\"I followed the guard's advice, and, crawling into my corner, wrapped\r\nmyself in the rug and lay back watching the rain-drops spattering\r\nalong the window-sill. At noon the train had not moved, and I lunched\r\nin the compartment. At four o'clock in the afternoon the\r\nstation-master came hurrying along the platform, crying, 'Montez!\r\nmontez! messieurs, s'il vous plaît'--and the train steamed out of the\r\nstation and whirled away through the flat, treeless Belgian plains. At\r\ntimes I dozed, but the shaking of the car always awoke me, and I would\r\nsit blinking out at the endless stretch of plain, until a sudden\r\nflurry of rain blotted the landscape from my eyes. At last a long,\r\nshrill whistle from the engine, a jolt, a series of bumps, and an\r\napparition of red trousers and bayonets warned me that we had arrived\r\nat the French frontier. I turned out with the others, and opened my\r\nvalise for inspection, but the customs officials merely chalked it,\r\nwithout examination, and I hurried back to my compartment amid the\r\nshouting of guards and the clanging of station bells. Again I found\r\nthat I was alone in the compartment, so I smoked a cigarette, thanked\r\nHeaven, and fell into a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\"How long I slept I do not know, but when I awoke the train was\r\nroaring through a tunnel. When again it flashed out into the open\r\ncountry I peered through the grimy, rain-stained window and saw that\r\nthe storm had ceased and stars were twinkling in the sky. I stretched\r\nmy legs, yawned, pushed my travelling-cap back from my forehead, and,\r\nstumbling to my feet, walked up and down the compartment until my\r\ncramped muscles were relieved. Then I sat down again, and, lighting a\r\ncigar, puffed great rings and clouds of fragrant smoke across the\r\naisle.\r\n\r\n\"The train was flying; the cars lurched and shook, and the windows\r\nrattled accompaniment to the creaking panels. The smoke from my cigar\r\ndimmed the lamp in the ceiling and hid the opposite seat from view.\r\nHow it curled and writhed in the corners, now eddying upward, now\r\nfloating across the aisle like a veil! I lounged back in my cushioned\r\nseat, watching it with interest. What queer shapes it took! How thick\r\nit was becoming!--how strangely luminous! Now it had filled the whole\r\ncompartment, puff after puff crowding upward, waving, wavering,\r\nclouding the windows, and blotting the lamp from sight. It was most\r\ninteresting. I had never before smoked such a cigar. What an\r\nextraordinary brand! I examined the end, flicking the ashes away. The\r\ncigar was out. Fumbling for a match to relight it, my eyes fell on the\r\ndrifting smoke-curtain which swayed across the corner opposite. It\r\nseemed almost tangible. How like a real curtain it hung, gray,\r\nimpenetrable! A man might hide behind it. Then an idea came into my\r\nhead, and it persisted until my uneasiness amounted to a vague terror.\r\nI tried to fight it off--I strove to resist--but the conviction slowly\r\nsettled upon me that something was behind that smoke-veil--something\r\nwhich had entered the compartment while I slept.\r\n\r\n\"'It can't be,' I muttered, my eyes fixed on the misty drapery; 'the\r\ntrain has not stopped.'\r\n\r\n\"The car creaked and trembled. I sprang to my feet and swept my arm\r\nthrough the veil of smoke. Then my hair rose on my head. For my hand\r\ntouched another hand, and my eyes had met two other eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I heard a voice in the gloom, low and sweet, calling me by name; I\r\nsaw the eyes again, tender and blue; soft fingers touched my own.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you afraid?' she said.\r\n\r\n\"My heart began to beat again, and my face warmed with returning\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\"'It is only I,' she said, gently.\r\n\r\n\"I seemed to hear my own voice speaking as if at a great distance,\r\n'You here--alone?'\r\n\r\n\"'How cruel of you!' she faltered; 'I am not alone.' At the same\r\ninstant my eyes fell upon the professor, calmly seated by the farther\r\nwindow. His hands were thrust into the folds of a corded and tasselled\r\ndressing-gown, from beneath which peeped two enormous feet encased in\r\ncarpet slippers. Upon his head towered a yellow night-cap. He did not\r\npay the slightest attention to either me or his daughter, and, except\r\nfor the lighted cigar which he kept shifting between his lips, he\r\nmight have been taken for a wax dummy.\r\n\r\n\"Then I began to speak, feebly, hesitating like a child.\r\n\r\n\"'How did you come into this compartment? You--you do not possess\r\nwings, I suppose? You could not have been here all the time. Will you\r\nexplain--explain to me? See, I ask you very humbly, for I do not\r\nunderstand. This is the nineteenth century, and these things don't fit\r\nin. I'm wearing a Dunlap hat--I've got a copy of the New York _Herald_\r\nin my bag--President Roosevelt is alive, and everything is so very\r\nunromantic in the world! Is this real magic? Perhaps I'm filled with\r\nhallucinations. Perhaps I'm asleep and dreaming. Perhaps you are not\r\nreally here--nor I--nor anybody, nor anything!'\r\n\r\n\"The train plunged into a tunnel, and when again it dashed out from\r\nthe other end the cold wind blew furiously in my face from the farther\r\nwindow. It was wide open; the professor was gone.\r\n\r\n\"'Papa has changed to another compartment,' she said, quietly. 'I\r\nthink perhaps you were beginning to bore him.'\r\n\r\n\"Her eyes met mine and she smiled.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you very much bewildered?'\r\n\r\n\"I looked at her in silence. She sat very quietly, her hands clasped\r\nabove her knee, her curly hair glittering to her girdle. A long robe,\r\nalmost silvery in the twilight, clung to her young figure; her bare\r\nfeet were thrust deep into a pair of shimmering Eastern slippers.\r\n\r\n\"'When you fled,' she sighed, 'I was asleep and there was no time to\r\nlose. I barely had a moment to go to Bombay, to find papa, and return\r\nin time to join you. This is an East-Indian costume.'\r\n\r\n\"Still I was silent.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you shocked?' she asked, simply.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I replied, in a dull voice, 'I'm past that.'\r\n\r\n\"'You are very rude,' she said, with the tears starting to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'I do not mean to be. I only wish to go away--away somewhere and find\r\nout what my name is.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your name is Harold Kensett.'\r\n\r\n\"'Are you sure?' I asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes--what troubles you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Is everything plain to you? Are you a sort of prophet and\r\nsecond-sight medium? Is nothing hidden from you?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing,' she faltered. My head ached and I clasped it in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"A sudden change came over her. 'I am human--believe me!' she said,\r\nwith piteous eagerness. 'Indeed, I do not seem strange to those who\r\nunderstand. You wonder, because you left me at midnight in Antwerp and\r\nyou wake to find me here. If, because I find myself reincarnated,\r\nendowed with senses and capabilities which few at present possess--if\r\nI am so made, why should it seem strange? It is all so natural to me.\r\nIf I appear to you--'\r\n\r\n\"'Appear?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes--'\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina!' I cried; 'can you vanish?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' she murmured; 'does it seem to you unmaidenly?'\r\n\r\n\"'Great Heaven!' I groaned.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't!' she cried, with tears in her voice--'oh, please don't! Help\r\nme to bear it! If you only knew how awful it is to be different from\r\nother girls--how mortifying it is to me to be able to vanish--oh, how\r\nI hate and detest it all!'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't cry,' I said, looking at her pityingly.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, dear me!' she sobbed. 'You shudder at the sight of me because I\r\ncan vanish.'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't!' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, you do! You abhor me--you shrink away! Oh, why did I ever see\r\nyou?--why did you ever come into my life?--what have I done in ages\r\npast, that now, reborn, I suffer cruelly--cruelly?'\r\n\r\n\"'What do you mean?' I whispered. My voice trembled with happiness.\r\n\r\n\"'I?--nothing; but you think me a fabled monster.'\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina--my sweet Wilhelmina,' I said, 'I don't think you a\r\nfabled monster. I love you; see--see--I am at your feet; listen to me,\r\nmy darling--'\r\n\r\n\"She turned her blue eyes to mine. I saw tears sparkling on the curved\r\nlashes.\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina, I love you,' I said again.\r\n\r\n\"Slowly she raised her hands to my head and held it a moment, looking\r\nat me strangely. Then her face grew nearer to my own, her glittering\r\nhair fell over my shoulders, her lips rested on mine.\r\n\r\n\"In that long, sweet kiss the beating of her heart answered mine, and\r\nI learned a thousand truths, wonderful, mysterious, splendid; but when\r\nour lips fell apart, the memory of what I learned departed also.\r\n\r\n\"'It was so very simple and beautiful,' she sighed, 'and I--I never\r\nsaw it. But the Mahatmas knew--ah, they knew that my mission could\r\nonly be accomplished through love.'\r\n\r\n\"'And it is,' I whispered, 'for you shall teach me--me, your husband.'\r\n\r\n\"'And--and you will not be impatient? You will try to believe?'\r\n\r\n\"'I will believe what you tell me, my sweetheart.'\r\n\r\n\"'Even about--cats?'\r\n\r\n\"Before I could reply the farther window opened and a yellow\r\nnight-cap, followed by the professor, entered from somewhere without.\r\nWilhelmina sank back on her sofa, but the professor needed not to be\r\ntold, and we both knew he was already busily reading our thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment there was dead silence--long enough for the professor to\r\ngrasp the full significance of what had passed. Then he uttered a\r\nsingle exclamation, 'Oh!'\r\n\r\n\"After a while, however, he looked at me for the first time that\r\nevening, saying, 'Congratulate you, Mr. Kensett, I'm sure,' tied\r\nseveral knots in the cord of his dressing-gown, lighted a cigar, and\r\npaid no further attention to either of us. Some moments later he\r\nopened the window again and disappeared. I looked across the aisle at\r\nWilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"'You may come over beside me,' she said, shyly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly ten o'clock and our train was rapidly approaching\r\nParis. We passed village after village wrapped in mist, station after\r\nstation hung with twinkling red and blue and yellow lanterns, then\r\nsped on again with the echo of the switch-bells ringing in our ears.\r\n\r\n\"When at length the train slowed up and stopped, I opened the window\r\nand looked out upon a long, wet platform, shining under the electric\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n\"A guard came running by, throwing open the doors of each compartment,\r\nand crying, 'Paris next! Tickets, if you please.'\r\n\r\n\"I handed him my book of coupons, from which he tore several and\r\nhanded it back. Then he lifted his lantern and peered into the\r\ncompartment, saying, 'Is monsieur alone?'\r\n\r\n\"I turned to Wilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"'He wants your ticket--give it to me.'\r\n\r\n\"'What's that?' demanded the guard.\r\n\r\n\"I looked anxiously at Wilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"'If your father has the tickets--' I began, but was interrupted by\r\nthe guard, who snapped:\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur will give himself the trouble to remember that I do not\r\nunderstand English.'\r\n\r\n\"'Keep quiet!' I said, sharply, in French. 'I am not speaking to\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\"The guard stared stupidly at me, then, at my luggage, and finally,\r\nentering the car, knelt down and peered under the seats. Presently he\r\ngot up, very red in the face, and went out slamming the door. He had\r\nnot paid the slightest attention to Wilhelmina, but I distinctly heard\r\nhim say, 'Only Englishmen and idiots talk to themselves!'\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina,' I faltered, 'do you mean to say that that guard could\r\nnot see you?'\r\n\r\n\"She began to look so serious again that I merely added, 'Never mind,\r\nI don't care whether you are invisible or not, dearest.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am not invisible to you,' she said; 'why should you care?'\r\n\r\n\"A great noise of bells and whistles drowned our voices, and, amid the\r\nwhirring of switch-bells, the hissing of steam, and the cries of\r\n'Paris! All out!' our train glided into the station.\r\n\r\n\"It was the professor who opened the door of our carriage. There he\r\nstood, calmly adjusting his yellow night-cap and drawing his\r\ndressing-gown closer with the corded tassels.\r\n\r\n\"'Where have you been?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'On the engine.'\r\n\r\n\"'_In_ the engine, I suppose you mean,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'No, I don't; I mean _on_ the engine--on the pilot. It was very\r\nrefreshing. Where are we going now?'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know Paris?' asked Wilhelmina, turning to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes. I think your father had better take you to the Hôtel Normandie\r\non the Rue de l'Échelle--'\r\n\r\n\"'But you must stay there, too!'\r\n\r\n\"'Of course--if you wish--'\r\n\r\n\"She laughed nervously.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't you see that my father and I could not take rooms--now? You\r\nmust engage three rooms for yourself.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why?' I asked, stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, dear--why, because we are invisible.'\r\n\r\n\"I tried to repress a shudder. The professor gave Wilhelmina his arm,\r\nand, as I studied his ensemble, I thanked Heaven that he was\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\n\"At the gate of the station I hailed a four-seated cab, and we rattled\r\naway through the stony streets, brilliant with gas-jets, and in a few\r\nmoments rolled smoothly across the Avenue de l'Opéra, turned into the\r\nRue de l'Échelle, and stopped. A bright little page, all over buttons,\r\ncame out, took my luggage, and preceded us into the hallway.\r\n\r\n\"I, with Wilhelmina on my arm and the professor shuffling along beside\r\nme, walked over to the desk.\r\n\r\n\"'Room?' said the clerk. 'We have a very desirable room on the second,\r\nfronting the Rue St. Honoré--'\r\n\r\n\"'But we--that is, I want three rooms--three separate rooms!' I said.\r\n\r\n\"The clerk scratched his chin. 'Monsieur is expecting friends?'\r\n\r\n\"'Say yes,' whispered Wilhelmina, with a suspicion of laughter in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I repeated, feebly.\r\n\r\n\"'Gentlemen, of course?' said the clerk, looking at me narrowly.\r\n\r\n\"'One lady.'\r\n\r\n\"'Married, of course?'\r\n\r\n\"'What's that to you?' I said, sharply. 'What do you mean by speaking\r\nto us--'\r\n\r\n\"'Us!'\r\n\r\n\"'I mean to me,' I said, badly rattled; 'give me the rooms and let me\r\nget to bed, will you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur will remember,' said the clerk, coldly, 'that this is an\r\nold and respectable hotel.'\r\n\r\n\"'I know it,' I said, smothering my rage.\r\n\r\n\"The clerk eyed me suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"'Front!' he called, with irritating deliberation. 'Show this\r\ngentleman to apartment ten.'\r\n\r\n\"'How many rooms are there!' I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"'Three sleeping-rooms and a parlor.'\r\n\r\n\"'I will take it,' I said, with composure.\r\n\r\n\"'On probation,' muttered the clerk, insolently.\r\n\r\n\"Swallowing the insult, I followed the bell-boy up the stairs, keeping\r\nbetween him and Wilhelmina, for I dreaded to see him walk through her\r\nas if she were thin air. A trim maid rose to meet us and conducted us\r\nthrough a hallway into a large apartment. She threw open all the\r\nbedroom-doors and said, 'Will monsieur have the goodness to choose?'\r\n\r\n\"'Which will you take,' I began, turning to Wilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"'I? Monsieur!' cried the startled maid.\r\n\r\n\"That completely upset me. 'Here,' I muttered, slipping some silver\r\ninto her hand; 'now, for the love of Heaven, run away!'\r\n\r\n\"When she had vanished with a doubtful 'Merci, monsieur!' I handed the\r\nprofessor the keys and asked him to settle the thing with Wilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"Wilhelmina took the corner room, the professor rambled into the next\r\none, and I said good-night and crept wearily into my own chamber. I\r\nsat down and tried to think. A great feeling of fatigue weighted my\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\"'I can think better with my clothes off,' I said, and slipped the\r\ncoat from my shoulders. How tired I was! 'I can think better in bed,'\r\nI muttered, flinging my cravat on the dresser and tossing my\r\nshirt-studs after it. I was certainly very tired. 'Now,' I yawned,\r\ngrasping the pillow and drawing it under my head--'now I can think a\r\nbit.' But before my head fell on the pillow sleep closed my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I began to dream at once. It seemed as though my eyes were wide open\r\nand the professor was standing beside my bed.\r\n\r\n\"'Young man,' he said, 'you've won my daughter and you must pay the\r\npiper!'\r\n\r\n\"'What piper?' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'The Pied Piper of Hamelin, I don't think,' replied the professor,\r\nvulgarly, and before I could realize what he was doing he had drawn a\r\nreed pipe from his dressing-gown and was playing a strangely annoying\r\nair. Then an awful thing occurred. Cats began to troop into the room,\r\ncats by the hundred--toms and tabbies, gray, yellow, Maltese, Persian,\r\nManx--all purring and all marching round and round, rubbing against\r\nthe furniture, the professor, and even against me. I struggled with\r\nthe nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"'Take them away!' I tried to gasp.\r\n\r\n\"'Nonsense!' he said; 'here is an old friend.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw the white tabby cat of the Hôtel St. Antoine.\r\n\r\n\"'An old friend,' he repeated, and played a dismal melody on his\r\nreed.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Wilhelmina enter the room, lift the white tabby in her arms,\r\nand bring her to my side.\r\n\r\n\"'Shake hands with him,' she commanded.\r\n\r\n\"To my horror the tabby deliberately extended a paw and tapped me on\r\nthe knuckles.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' I cried, in agony; 'this is a horrible dream! Why, oh, why\r\ncan't I wake!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' she said, dropping the cat, 'it is partly a dream, but some of\r\nit is real. Remember what I say, my darling; you are to go to-morrow\r\nmorning and meet the twelve-o'clock train from Antwerp at the Gare du\r\nNord. Papa and I are coming to Paris on that train. Don't you know\r\nthat we are not really here now, you silly boy? Good-night, then. I\r\nshall be very glad to see you.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw her glide from the room, followed by the professor, playing a\r\ngay quick-step, to which the cats danced two and two.\r\n\r\n\"'Good-night, sir,' said each cat as it passed my bed; and I dreamed\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n\"When I awoke, the room, the bed had vanished; I was in the street,\r\nwalking rapidly; the sun shone down on the broad, white pavements of\r\nParis, and the streams of busy life flowed past me on either side. How\r\nswiftly I was walking! Where the devil was I going? Surely I had\r\nbusiness somewhere that needed immediate attention. I tried to\r\nremember when I had awakened, but I could not. I wondered where I had\r\ndressed myself; I had apparently taken great pains with my toilet, for\r\nI was immaculate, monocle and all, even down to a long-stemmed rose\r\nnestling in my button-hole. I knew Paris and recognized the streets\r\nthrough which I was hurrying. Where could I be going? What was my\r\nhurry? I glanced at my watch and found I had not a moment to lose.\r\nThen, as the bells of the city rang out mid-day, I hastened into the\r\nrailroad station on the Rue Lafayette and walked out to the platform.\r\nAnd as I looked down the glittering track, around the distant curve\r\nshot a locomotive followed by a long line of cars. Nearer and nearer\r\nit came, while the station-gongs sounded and the switch-bells began\r\nringing all along the track.\r\n\r\n\"'Antwerp express!' cried the sous-chef de gare, and as the train\r\nslipped along the tiled platform I sprang upon the steps of a\r\nfirst-class carriage and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\"'How do you do, Mr. Kensett?' said Wilhelmina Wyeth, springing\r\nlightly to the platform. 'Really it is very nice of you to come to the\r\ntrain.' At the same moment a bald, mild-eyed gentleman emerged from\r\nthe depths of the same compartment, carrying a large, covered basket.\r\n\r\n\"'How are you, Kensett?' he said. 'Glad to see you again. Rather warm\r\nin that compartment--no, I will not trust this basket to an\r\nexpressman; give Wilhelmina your arm and I'll follow. We go to the\r\nNormandie, I believe?'\r\n\r\n\"All the morning I had Wilhelmina to myself, and at dinner I sat\r\nbeside her, with the professor opposite. The latter was cheerful\r\nenough, but he nearly ruined my appetite, for he smelled strongly of\r\ncatnip. After dinner he became restless and fidgeted about in his\r\nchair until coffee was brought, and we went up to the parlor of our\r\napartment. Here his restlessness increased to such an extent that I\r\nventured to ask him if he was in good health.\r\n\r\n\"'It's that basket--the covered basket which I have in the next room,'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the trouble with the basket?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'The basket's all right--but the contents worry me.'\r\n\r\n\"'May I inquire what the contents are?' I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"The professor rose.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' he said, 'you may inquire of my daughter.' He left the room,\r\nbut reappeared shortly, carrying a saucer of milk.\r\n\r\n\"I watched him enter the next room, which was mine.\r\n\r\n\"'What on earth is he taking that into my room for?' I asked\r\nWilhelmina. 'I don't keep cats.'\r\n\r\n\"'But you will,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'I? Never!'\r\n\r\n\"'You will if I ask you to.'\r\n\r\n\"'But--but you won't ask me.'\r\n\r\n\"'But I do.'\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina!'\r\n\r\n\"'Harold!'\r\n\r\n\"'I detest cats.'\r\n\r\n\"'You must not.'\r\n\r\n\"'I can't help it.'\r\n\r\n\"'You will when I ask it. Have I not given myself to you? Will you not\r\nmake a little sacrifice for me?'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't understand--'\r\n\r\n\"'Would you refuse my first request?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I said, miserably, 'I will keep dozens of cats--'\r\n\r\n\"'I do not ask that; I only wish you to keep one.'\r\n\r\n\"'Was that what your father had in that basket?' I asked,\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, the basket came from Antwerp.'\r\n\r\n\"'What! The white Antwerp cat!' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'And you ask me to keep that cat? Oh, Wilhelmina!'\r\n\r\n\"'Listen!' she said. 'I have a long story to tell you; come nearer,\r\nclose to me. You say you love me?'\r\n\r\n\"I bent and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"'Then I shall put you to the proof,' she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"'Prove me!'\r\n\r\n\"'Listen. That cat is the same cat that ran out of the apartment in\r\nthe Waldorf when your great-aunt ceased to exist--in human shape. My\r\nfather and myself, having received word from the Mahatmas of the Trust\r\nCompany, sheltered and cherished the cat. We were ordered by the\r\nMahatmas to convert you. The task was appalling--but there is no such\r\nthing as refusing a command, and we laid our plans. That man with a\r\nwhite spot in his hair was my father--'\r\n\r\n\"'What! Your father is bald.'\r\n\r\n\"'He wore a wig then. The white spot came from dropping chemicals on\r\nthe wig while experimenting with a substance which you could not\r\ncomprehend.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then--then that clew was useless; but who could have taken the\r\nCrimson Diamond? And who was the man with the white spot on his head\r\nwho tried to sell the stone in Paris?'\r\n\r\n\"'That was my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'He--he--st--took the Crimson Diamond!' I cried, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes and no. That was only a paste stone that he had in Paris. It\r\nwas to draw you over here. He had the real Crimson Diamond also.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your father?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes. He has it in the next room now. Can you not see how it\r\ndisappeared, Harold? Why, the cat swallowed it!'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mean to say that the white tabby swallowed the Crimson\r\nDiamond?'\r\n\r\n\"'By mistake. She tried to get it out of the velvet bag, and, as the\r\nbag was also full of catnip, she could not resist a mouthful, and\r\nunfortunately just then you broke in the door and so startled the cat\r\nthat she swallowed the Crimson Diamond.'\r\n\r\n\"There was a painful pause. At last I said:\r\n\r\n\"'Wilhelmina, as you are able to vanish, I suppose you also are able\r\nto converse with cats.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am,' she replied, trying to keep back the tears of mortification.\r\n\r\n\"'And that cat told you this?'\r\n\r\n\"'She did.'\r\n\r\n\"'And my Crimson Diamond is inside that cat?'\r\n\r\n\"'It is.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said I, firmly, 'I am going to chloroform the cat.'\r\n\r\n\"'Harold!' she cried, in terror, 'that cat is your great-aunt!'\r\n\r\n\"I don't know to this day how I stood the shock of that announcement,\r\nor how I managed to listen while Wilhelmina tried to explain the\r\ntransmigration theory, but it was all Chinese to me. I only knew that\r\nI was a blood relation of a cat, and the thought nearly drove me mad.\r\n\r\n\"'Try, my darling, try to love her,' whispered Wilhelmina; 'she must\r\nbe very precious to you--'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, with my diamond inside her,' I replied, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"'You must not neglect her,' said Wilhelmina.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh no, I'll always have my eye on her--I mean I will surround her\r\nwith luxury--er, milk and bones and catnip and books--er--does she\r\nread?'\r\n\r\n\"'Not the books that human beings read. Now, go and speak to your\r\naunt, Harold.'\r\n\r\n\"'Eh! How the deuce--'\r\n\r\n\"'Go; for my sake try to be cordial.'\r\n\r\n\"She rose and led me unresistingly to the door of my room.\r\n\r\n\"'Good Heavens!' I groaned; 'this is awful.'\r\n\r\n\"'Courage, my darling!' she whispered. 'Be brave for love of me.'\r\n\r\n\"I drew her to me and kissed her. Beads of cold perspiration started\r\nin the roots of my hair, but I clenched my teeth and entered the room\r\nalone. The room was dark and I stood silent, not knowing where to\r\nturn, fearful lest I step on my aunt! Then, through the dreary\r\nsilence, I called, 'Aunty!'\r\n\r\n\"A faint noise broke upon my ear, and my heart grew sick, but I strode\r\ninto the darkness, calling, hoarsely:\r\n\r\n\"'Aunt Tabby! It is your nephew!'\r\n\r\n\"Again the faint sound. Something was stirring there among the\r\nshadows--a shape moving softly along the wall, a shade which glided by\r\nme, paused, wavered, and darted under the bed. Then I threw myself on\r\nthe floor, profoundly moved, begging, imploring my aunt to come to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'Aunty! Aunty!' I murmured. 'Your nephew is waiting to take you to\r\nhis heart!'\r\n\r\n\"At last I saw my great-aunt's eyes shining in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man's voice grew hushed and solemn, and he lifted his hand\r\nin silence:\r\n\r\n\"Close the door. That meeting is not for the eyes of the world! Close\r\nthe door upon that sacred scene where great-aunt and nephew are united\r\nat last.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA long pause followed; deep emotion was visible in Miss Barrison's\r\nsensitive face. She said:\r\n\r\n\"Then--you are married?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Kensett, in a mortified voice.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I asked, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he said, \"although my fiancée was prepared to accept a cat\r\nas her great-aunt, she could not endure the complications that\r\nfollowed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What complications?\" inquired Miss Barrison.\r\n\r\nThe young man sighed profoundly, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"My great-aunt had kittens,\" he said, softly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tremendous scientific importance of these experiences excited me\r\nbeyond measure. The simplicity of the narrative, the elaborate\r\nattention to corroborative detail, all bore irresistible testimony to\r\nthe truth of these accounts of phenomena vitally important to the\r\nentire world of science.\r\n\r\nWe all dined together that night--a little earnest company of\r\nknowledge-seekers in the vast wilderness of the unexplored; and we\r\nlingered long in the dining-car, propounding questions, advancing\r\ntheories, speculating upon possibilities of most intense interest.\r\nNever before had I known a man whose relatives were cats and kittens,\r\nbut he did not appear to share my enthusiasm in the matter.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, looking at Miss Barrison, \"it may be interesting\r\nfrom a purely scientific point of view, but it has already proved a\r\nbar to my marrying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the kittens black?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"my aunt drew the color-line, I am proud to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said Miss Barrison, \"why the fact that your great-aunt\r\nis a cat should prevent you from marrying.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't prevent _me_!\" said the young man, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Nor me,\" mused Miss Barrison--\"if I were really in love.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had been very busy thinking about Professor Farrago, and,\r\ncoming to an interesting theory, advanced it.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" I began, \"he marries one of those transparent ladies, what about\r\nthe children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some would be, no doubt, transparent,\" said Kensett.\r\n\r\n\"They might be only translucent,\" suggested Miss Barrison.\r\n\r\n\"Or partially opaque,\" I ventured. \"But it's a risky marriage--not to\r\nbe able to see what one's wife is about--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a silly reflection on women,\" said Miss Barrison, quietly.\r\n\"Besides, a girl need not be transparent to conceal what she's\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\nThis observation seemed to end our postprandial and tripartite\r\nconference; Miss Barrison retired to her stateroom presently; after a\r\nlast cigar, smoked almost in silence, the young man and I bade each\r\nother a civil good-night and retired to our respective berths.\r\n\r\nI think it was at Richmond, Virginia, that I was awakened by the negro\r\nporter shaking me very gently and repeating, in a pleasant, monotonous\r\nvoice: \"Teleg'am foh you, suh! Teleg'am foh Mistuh Gilland, suh. 'Done\r\ncall you 'lev'm times sense breakfass, suh! Las' call foh luncheon,\r\nsuh. Teleg'am foh--\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens!\" I muttered, sitting up in my bunk, \"is it as late as that!\r\nWhere are we?\" I slid up the window-shade and sat blinking at a flood\r\nof sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"Telegram?\" I said, yawning and rubbing my eyes. \"Let me have it. All\r\nright, I'll be out presently. Shut that curtain! I don't want the\r\nentire car to criticise my pink pajamas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain' nobody in de cyar, 'scusin yo'se'f, suh,\" grinned the porter,\r\nretiring.\r\n\r\nI heard him, but did not comprehend, sitting there sleepily unfolding\r\nthe scrawled telegram. Suddenly my eyes flew wide open; I scanned the\r\ndespatch with stunned incredulity:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"ATLANTA, GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n    \"We couldn't help it. Love at first sight. Married this\r\n    morning in Atlanta. Wildly happy. Forgive. Wire blessing.\r\n\r\n          \"(Signed) HAROLD KENSETT,\r\n          \"HELEN BARRISON KENSETT.\"\r\n\r\n\"Porter!\" I shouted. \"Porter! Help!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no response.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord!\" I groaned, and rolled over, burying my head in the\r\nblankets; for I understood at last that Science, the most jealous,\r\nmost exacting of mistresses, could never brook a rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                      |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    | Page  86: beautful replaced with beautiful                   |\r\n    | Page 180: Magazin replaced with Magazine                     |\r\n    | Page 206: sun-sorched replaced with sun-scorched             |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's In Search of the Unknown, by Robert W.
