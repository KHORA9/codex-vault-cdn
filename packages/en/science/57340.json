Porter’s “Tropical Agriculturist”\r\nhas long been out of print, and my own work on “The Commercial Products\r\nof the Vegetable Kingdom” is too expensive and too diffuse for ordinary\r\nreference. The present hand-book deals with the subject in a popular\r\nform, but, at the same time, supplies correct information on most\r\npoints, combined with the fullest descriptive and statistical details\r\nrespecting every coffee-producing country. For much of the information\r\nrelating to coffee cultivation in Ceylon, I am indebted to a small\r\ntreatise by Mr. G. C. Lewis, privately published in that island. For the\r\nviews of buildings and scenery, I am under obligations to Sir Emerson\r\nTennent and Messrs. Worms, who kindly lent me original drawings and\r\nphotographs--whilst the microscopic representations of pure and\r\nadulterated coffee and chicory are copied, by permission, from Dr.\r\nHassall’s elaborate work on “Food and its Adulterations.” Trusting that\r\nthis little work may be found useful and interesting to a large class, I\r\nsend it forth as the pioneer of other hand-books on the great staples of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n                                                               P.

It is a large erect bush, quite smooth in\r\nevery part; leaves oblong lanceolate, acuminate, shining on the upper\r\nside, wavy, deep green above, paler below; stipules subulate, undivided.\r\nPeduncles axillary, short, clustered; corollas white, funnel-shaped,\r\nsweet-scented, with four or five oblong-spreading twisted lobes. Fruit a\r\ncompressed drupe, furrowed along the side, crowned by the calyx. Seeds\r\nsolitary, plano-convex, with a deep furrow along the flat side. Putamen\r\nlike parchment.\r\n\r\nThe generic name given to the plant by Linnæus was taken, it is said,\r\nfrom Coffee, a province of Narea, in Africa where it grows in abundance.\r\n\r\nPlate 1 represents a branch of the coffee-tree in blossom and fruit,\r\nand the lettered figures at the foot have reference to the dissection of\r\nthe flower and fruit.\r\n\r\nA--The flower, cut open, to show the situation of the five filaments,\r\nwith their summits lying upon them.\r\n\r\nB--Represents the flower cup, with its four small indentations enclosing\r\nthe germ or embryo seed-vessel, from the middle of which arises the\r\nstyle, terminated by the two reflexed spongy tops.\r\n\r\nC--The fruit entire, marked at the top with a puncture like a navel.\r\n\r\nD--The fruit open, to show that it consists ordinarily of two seeds,\r\nwhich are surrounded by the pulp.\r\n\r\nE--The fruit cut horizontally, to show the seeds as they are placed\r\nerect, with their flat sides, together.\r\n\r\nF--One of the seeds taken out, with the membrane or parchment upon it.\r\n\r\nG--The same with the parchment torn open, to give a view of the seed.\r\n\r\nH--The seed without the parchment.\r\n\r\nLindley and Paxton only enumerate two species: _C. arabica_, native of\r\nYemen, and _C. paniculata_, indigenous to Guiana.\r\n\r\nContinental botanists, however, describe no less than eight other\r\nspecies: four inhabiting Peru, _C. microcarpa_, _C. umbellata_, _C.\r\nacuminata_, and _C. subsessilis_; two indigenous to the West Coast of\r\nAfrica, _C. laurina_ and _C. racemosa_; and two natives of the East\r\nIndies, _C. bengalensis_ and _C. Indica_. Some of these are probably\r\nmere varieties.\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin may have been, there can be no doubt that there are\r\nthree kinds or species now grown, differing materially from each other.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian or Mocha coffee is characterised by having a small and more\r\nbrittle leaf, with branches shorter, and more upright than the Jamaica\r\nand Ceylon coffee; and by its berry being almost always, or at least\r\nvery frequently, single seeded, and the seed cylindrical and plump.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica coffee-tree has a larger and more pliable leaf, longer and\r\nmore drooping branches, and berries almost always containing two seeds.\r\n(_The Ethiopian._)\r\n\r\nThe great difference now existing between the two kinds, may possibly\r\nhave originated in the change of soil, climate, and season, operating\r\nthrough a series of years; but this difference is so decided, and so\r\nstrongly marked, that the veriest tyro can in a moment pronounce of\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThe East India or Bengal coffee-tree differs much from all others, but\r\nis in every respect a veritable coffee.\r\n\r\nThe leaf is smaller, and lighter green, than the foregoing variety; its\r\nberry is infinitely smaller, and when ripening, turns black instead of\r\nblood-red. Coffee made from it is of excellent flavour, and much liked.\r\n\r\nWithin the tropics, coffee thrives best at an elevation of 1200 to 3000\r\nfeet, and rarely grows above 6000 feet. It may be cultivated as far as\r\n36° north latitude, where the mean temperature is about 70°.\r\n\r\nIn the western hemisphere coffee is grown in many of the West India\r\nIslands, in Central America, the northern republics of South America,\r\nBerbice, Cayenne, and Brazil. In Africa it is grown in Liberia and other\r\nparts of Western Africa, at St. Helena, in Egypt, and Mozambique, and a\r\nlittle in Natal. Passing eastward we find it in Arabia, one of the\r\noldest seats of culture, the southern peninsula of India, Ceylon,\r\nBourbon, Java, Célèbes, and other parts of the Eastern Archipelago,\r\nSiam, and some of the Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nCoffee-plants are able to bear an amount of cold which is little known\r\nor thought of. The high and cold regions of Jamaica near St. Catherine’s\r\nPeak, and the foot of the Great Blue Mountain Peak, both situated at\r\nsome 6000 feet above the level of the sea; and, again, the mountains of\r\nArabia, the Neilgherries, and Ceylon, furnish instances of the great\r\ndegree of cold that the coffee-plant will endure. More than this, it is\r\nan established fact that it bears a larger, plumper, and far more\r\naromatic berry at these altitudes than in a lower situation and in a\r\nwarmer temperature. The coffee produced on plantations near the foot of\r\nthe Blue Mountain Peak, in Jamaica, is the finest in the world. In\r\nArabia, likewise, the cold at night is sometimes intense; yet who will\r\ndispute the goodness of Mocha coffee?\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the beauty of the rows or walks planted with\r\ncoffee-trees, from their pyramidical shape and glossy dark leaves,\r\namongst which are hanging the ripe, scarlet-coloured berries. A writer,\r\nin his “Impressions of the West Indies,” thus speaks: “Anything in the\r\nway of cultivation more beautiful or more fragrant than a\r\ncoffee-plantation I had not conceived, and oft did I say to myself that\r\nif ever I became, from health or otherwise, a cultivator of the soil\r\nwithin the tropics, I would cultivate the coffee-plant, even though I\r\ndid so irrespective altogether of the profit that might be derived from\r\nso doing. Much has been written, and not without justice, of the rich\r\nfragrance of an orange-grove, and at home we ofttimes hear of the sweet\r\nodours of a bean-field. I have, too, often enjoyed, in the Carse of\r\nStirling and elsewhere in Scotland, the balmy breezes as they swept over\r\nthe latter, particularly when the sun had burst out with unusual\r\nstrength after a shower of rain. I have likewise in Martinique, Santa\r\nCruz, Jamaica, and Cuba, inhaled the breezes wafted from the orangeries,\r\nbut not for a moment would I compare either with the exquisite aromatic\r\nodours from a coffee-plantation in full bloom, when the\r\nhill-side--covered over with regular rows of the shrubs, with their\r\nmillions of jasmine-like flowers--showers down upon you as you ride up\r\nbetween the plants a perfume\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 2.--A Coffee Plantation in Jamaica.]\r\n\r\nof the most delicately delicious description. ’Tis worth going to the\r\nWest Indies to see the sight and inhale the perfume.”\r\n\r\nPlate 2 represents a coffee plantation in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn the culture of the tree there is a singular difference in the western\r\nand eastern hemispheres, inasmuch as in the former shade is considered\r\ninjurious, whilst in the latter it is held to be desirable, if not\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ITS INTRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee, although taking its common and specific names from Arabia, is\r\nnot a native plant of that country, but of Abyssinia, where it is found\r\nboth in the wild and cultivated state. From that country it was brought\r\nto Arabia, in comparatively very recent times. Mr. Lane states that it\r\nwas first used there about the year 1450. It was not known to the Arabs,\r\ntherefore, for more than eight hundred years after the time of Mahomed,\r\nand was introduced only between forty and fifty years before the\r\ndiscovery of America. The Arabians called coffee kăhwăh, which is an old\r\nword in their language for wine. The unlucky word gave rise to a dispute\r\nabout the legality of its use among the Mahomedan doctors, who,\r\nmistaking the word for the thing it represented, denounced as a narcotic\r\nthat which was anti-narcotic. They were beaten, and coffee has ever\r\nsince become a legitimate and favourite potable of the Arabs.\r\n\r\nIn a century its use spread to Egypt and other parts of the Turkish\r\nempire. For two centuries from its introduction into Arabia, the use of\r\ncoffee seems to have been confined to the Mahomedan nations of Western\r\nAsia; and, considering its rapid spread and popularity among the\r\nEuropean nations, it is remarkable that it has not, like tobacco,\r\nextended to the Hindus, the Hindu-Chinese, the Japanese, or the tribes\r\nof the Indian Archipelago, who no more use it than the Europeans do the\r\nbetel preparation. The high price of coffee and the low cost of tobacco,\r\nmost likely afford the true solution of the difference. One striking\r\nresult of the use of coffee first, and then of tobacco, among the\r\nMahomedan nations is well deserving of notice. These commodities have\r\nbeen in a great measure substituted for wine and spirits, which had been\r\nlargely, although clandestinely, used before, and hence a great\r\nimprovement in the sobriety of Arabs, Persians, and Turks. I give this\r\ninteresting fact on the authority of Mr. Lane, who mentions it in the\r\nnotes to his translation of the Arabian Nights.[1]\r\n\r\nFrom Turkey coffee found its way to Europe. It came in use in England\r\nbefore either tea or chocolate. A Turkey merchant of London, of the name\r\nof Edwards, is said to have brought the first bag of coffee to England,\r\nand his Greek servant to have made the first dish of English coffee\r\nabout 1652. But it is stated in the Life of Wood, the antiquary, that\r\n“in 1651, one Jacob, a Jew, opened a coffee-house at the Angel, in the\r\nparish of St. Peter-in-the-East, Oxon; and there it was, by some who\r\ndelighted in noveltie, drunk. When he left Oxon, he sold it in Old\r\nSouthampton-buildings, in Holborne, near London, and was living there in\r\n1671.”\r\n\r\nCoffee-houses were soon after opened in various parts of the metropolis,\r\nas also in other parts of the kingdom, for vending it. The excise\r\nofficers visited the coffee-houses at fixed periods, and took an account\r\nof the number of gallons of the liquid that were made, upon which a duty\r\nof 4d. per gallon was charged until 1689.\r\n\r\nThree years after the first introduction of coffee upon the statute\r\nbooks, the increase of houses for its sale had become so great, that by\r\nthe Act passed in 1663, “For the better ordering and collecting the duty\r\nof excise, and preventing the abuses therein” (15 Chas. II., cap. 11,\r\nsect. 15), express provision is made for the licensing of all\r\ncoffee-houses at the quarter sessions, under a penalty of 5_l._ for\r\nevery month during which any person should retail coffee, chocolate, or\r\ntea, without having first procured such license from the magistrates.\r\nFrom that time to the revolution, coffee-houses multiplied so rapidly\r\nthat, when Ray published his “History of Plants” in 1688, he estimated\r\nthat the coffee-houses in London were at that time as numerous as in\r\nCairo itself; whilst similar places of accommodation were to be met with\r\nin all the principal cities and towns in England.\r\n\r\nThere are now in London alone more than 1500 coffee-houses, besides\r\nconfectioners’ shops, and other places where coffee is vended.\r\n\r\nFor half a century at least Arabia furnished all the coffee that Europe\r\nconsumed, which, therefore, must have been very trifling. It was, in\r\nfact, long the luxury of a few fashionable people, with whom, however,\r\nit must have been in general use sixty years after its introduction, as\r\nwe find from the well-known passage of the “Rape of the Lock,” published\r\nin 1712, in which politicians are described as seeing through it “with\r\nhalf-shut eyes.”\r\n\r\nLe Grand d’Aussy, in his “Vie Privée des Français,” gives a curious and\r\ninteresting account of the first introduction of the use of coffee in\r\nFrance. As early as 1658 some merchants of Marseilles introduced the use\r\nof coffee into that city, and Thévenot, after his return from his\r\nEastern travels, about the year 1658, regaled his guests with coffee\r\nafter dinner.\r\n\r\n“This, however,” says Le Grand, “was but the eccentricity of a\r\ntraveller, which would not come into fashion among such a people as the\r\nParisians. To bring coffee into credit, some extraordinary and striking\r\ncircumstance was necessary. This circumstance occurred on the arrival,\r\nin 1669, of an embassy from the Grand Seigneur Mahomet IV. to Louis\r\nXIV. Soliman Aga, chief of the mission, having passed six months in the\r\ncapital, and during his stay having acquired the friendship of the\r\nParisians by some traits of wit and gallantry, several persons of\r\ndistinction, chiefly women, had the curiosity to visit him at his house.\r\nThe manner in which he received them not only inspired a wish to renew\r\nthe visit, but induced others to follow their example. He caused coffee\r\nto be served to his guests, according to the custom of his country; for\r\nsince fashion had introduced the custom of serving this beverage among\r\nthe Turks, civility demanded that it should be offered to visitors, as\r\nwell as that those should not decline partaking of it. If a Frenchman,\r\nin a similar case, to please the ladies, had presented to them this\r\nblack and bitter liquor, he would be rendered for ever ridiculous. But\r\nthe beverage was served by a Turk--a gallant Turk--and this was\r\nsufficient to give it inestimable value. Besides, before the palate\r\ncould judge, the eyes were seduced by the display of elegance and\r\nneatness which accompanied it, by those brilliant porcelain cups into\r\nwhich it was poured, by napkins with gold fringes, on which it was\r\nserved to the ladies; add to this the furniture, the dresses, and the\r\nforeign customs, the strangeness of addressing the host through the\r\ninterpreter, being seated on the ground, on tiles, &c., and you will\r\nallow that there was more than enough to turn the heads of French women.\r\nLeaving the hotel of the ambassador with an enthusiasm easily imagined,\r\nthey hastened to their acquaintances, to speak of the coffee of which\r\nthey had partaken; and Heaven only knows to what a degree they were\r\nexcited.”\r\n\r\nThe extravagant price of coffee, notwithstanding that the fashion of\r\ndrinking it was established, prevented it from coming into general use.\r\nIt was only to be had, according to Le Grand, at Marseilles, and even\r\nthere not in any quantity. Labat, quoted by him, states that the price\r\nat this time was the enormous one of forty crowns a pound. In 1672, an\r\nArmenian opened in Paris the first coffee-house, on the plan of those he\r\nhad seen at Constantinople. Pascal was followed by a crowd of imitators,\r\nwhose numbers became so great in 1676, that it was found necessary to\r\nform them into a society by statute.\r\n\r\nAs to the European names of coffee, they are all, observes Mr. Crawfurd,\r\nfrom the same source, the old Arabic word for wine, kăhwăh, which is\r\ncomposed of a very guttural _k_, unpronounceable by Europeans, except by\r\nan awkward effort, of the labial _w_, and of two short vowels ă, with an\r\naspirate at the end of each syllable. The Turks have changed the labial\r\n_w_ into _v_, and the European nations, who took the word directly from\r\nthem, have corrupted the word by converting the labial _v_ into the\r\nlabial _f_, by substituting an ordinary _k_ or hard _c_ for the Arabic\r\nguttural, by omitting both the aspirates, and by converting the last\r\nshort ă into ĕ, or as with ourselves, always the greatest corruptors of\r\northography, changing both the vowels.\r\n\r\nThe Mahomedans distinguish three kinds of kăhwăh--wine, or anything that\r\ninebriates; the extract from the pulp which contains the coffee-berry;\r\nand that from the berry itself. The deep brown colour of the liquor\r\noccasioned its being called the syrup of the Indian mulberry, under\r\nwhich specious name it first became fashionable in Europe; and some who\r\nimported the pulp called it the “flower of the coffee-tree,” but it\r\nfailed in use. Coffee is used in vast quantities by the Turks and\r\nArabians, and with peculiar propriety, as it counteracts the narcotic\r\neffects of opium, to the use of which they are so much addicted.\r\n\r\nThe history of the cultivation of coffee by European nations in their\r\ncolonies is singular. The old Dutch East India Company carried on some\r\ntraffic with the Arabian ports in the Red Sea; and about the year 1690,\r\nthe Dutch Governor-General of India, Van Hoorne, caused some ripe\r\ncoffee-seeds to be brought to Java; they were planted, grew, and\r\nproduced fruit. He sent a single plant home from. Batavia to Nicholas\r\nWitsen, the Governor of the East India Company, which arrived safe, was\r\nplanted in the Botanic Gardens of Amsterdam, where it prospered,\r\nproduced fruit, and the fruit young plants. From the Amsterdam garden\r\nplants were sent to the Dutch colony of Surinam, and the planters\r\nentered on the cultivation of coffee in 1718. The authority for this is\r\nthe celebrated physician and botanist, Boerhaave, in his Index of the\r\nLeyden Garden. In ten years after its cultivation in Surinam it was\r\nintroduced from that colony by the English into Jamaica. It was sent to\r\nMartinique from France in 1720. The first coffee-plant cultivated in\r\nBrazil, now the greatest producing country in the world, was reared by a\r\nFranciscan monk, of the name of Vellosa, in the garden of the convent of\r\nSan Antonio, near Rio Janeiro; it throve, and the monk presented its\r\nripe fruit to the viceroy, Lavrado. He judiciously distributed it to the\r\nplanters, who commenced its cultivation in 1774. From Java the\r\ncoffee-plant was conveyed to Sumatra, to Célèbes, to the Philippines,\r\nand in our own times to Malabar, Mysore, and Ceylon. The few\r\ncoffee-berries brought from Mocha to Batavia are the parents of the vast\r\nquantity now produced, all the coffee now consumed (exceeding\r\n500,000,000 lbs.), save the trifle yielded by Arabia, has the same\r\norigin, and the great cultivation and commerce in coffee has all sprung\r\nup in less than one hundred and seventy-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes in the sources of supply of coffee within the last quarter\r\nof a century are very remarkable. The British possessions in the East,\r\nwhere land and labour is cheap, have taken the place which our Western\r\npossessions formerly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe British West India Islands and Demerara have fallen off in their\r\nproduction of coffee from 30,000,000 lbs. to 4,000,000 lbs. San Domingo,\r\nCuba, and the French West India colonies are also gradually giving up\r\ncoffee culture in favour of other staples. It is chiefly Brazil, some of\r\nthe Central American republics, Java, Ceylon, and British India, that\r\nare able to render coffee a profitable crop.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century the consumption of coffee was under one\r\nmillion pounds; the only descriptions then known in the London market\r\nwere Grenada, Jamaica, and Mocha--the two former averaging about 5_l._\r\nper cwt., and the latter 20_l._ per cwt. Grenada coffee is now unknown,\r\nand Ceylon, Java, and Brazil are the largest producers.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 the total quantity of coffee consumed in the United Kingdom was\r\n262,000 lbs., or three-quarters of an ounce to each person in the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1801 to 1804 the average quantity of coffee consumed by each\r\nindividual of the population was only about 1 oz., whilst 1½ lbs. of tea\r\nper head was used. From 1805 to 1809 the consumption of coffee was 3 oz.\r\nper head. From 1810 to 1824, when the duty was reduced by about\r\none-third, the consumption was 8 oz. After this, when the duty on\r\nBritish-grown coffee was further reduced to 9d. and 6d. the pound, the\r\nconsumption rose to 1 lb., and by 1850 to 1½ lbs. But this consumption\r\nwas not uniform for the United Kingdom, for while in England 1 lb. 12\r\noz. was used, in Scotland only 6 oz. were consumed, and in Ireland but 2\r\noz.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of coffee consumed in Great Britain in each decennial\r\nperiod, comparing the consumption with the growth of the population, and\r\nexhibiting the influence of high and low duties, are shown by the\r\nfollowing statement. The figures up to 1841 are from Porter’s “Progress\r\nof the Nation.” Those since are computed from official documents:\r\n\r\n  -----+-------------+---------+---------------+------------\r\n       | No. of lbs. | Duty on | Population    | Average\r\n       |  consumed.  |  B.

It is analogous to Mocha, and of\r\na pleasant aromatic flavour.\r\n\r\nThat of Guadaloupe is elongated, larger, of a dark greyish green, and\r\nnearly always without any pellicle.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-berry of Martinique is also large, oval, flat on one side,\r\nwith the furrow deep and straight for the greater part of its length,\r\nbut diverging at the ends. Its odour is agreeable, and the flavour\r\nstrong when used alone, but it is generally mixed with Mocha.\r\n\r\nThe Mocha berry is very variable in form, size, and colour, but it is\r\ngenerally more round or compressed than other coffees; its odour is\r\nstrong and agreeable, and very characteristic. Many of the seeds are\r\noften covered by the endocarp, while others are without the pellicle. A\r\ngreat number also are rounded, and the involuted edges form a deep\r\nfurrow, differing from the ordinary one. The form of these seeds is due\r\nto the abortion of the other half of the fruit, which gives it this\r\nparticular formation.\r\n\r\nAden, _alias_ Mocha, coffee is, along with the other coffees of the Red\r\nSea, sent first to Bombay in Arab ships, where it is “garbelled”\r\n(picked), previously to its being exported to England. The bean is\r\nalways broad and small, and the climate of India is supposed to improve\r\nits flavour. The seed of the Berbera (Abyssinian) plant is usually\r\ncalled long-berried Mocha.\r\n\r\nThe Java and East Indian, next in quality, are larger, and of a paler\r\nyellow. The Ceylon berries are of irregular sizes, ill-shaped, and of a\r\nspotted dirty cream-colour. The terms “Plantation” and “Native” coffees,\r\nas applied to Ceylon berries, are distinctions arising from one being\r\nthe cultivated coffee of the estates of the planters, which are better\r\nattended to and prepared for market, while the other is that grown in a\r\nwild or careless manner by the natives about their dwellings, and more\r\nrudely prepared. Java coffee is chiefly prized in the market for its\r\ndelicacy of flavour, but in point of strength it falls short of the West\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nOf Bourbon coffee there are in commerce two qualities, fine and\r\nordinary. The first is in small seeds, well selected for size, of a\r\nvariable colour, yellow or green, with little pellicle, the furrow\r\nslightly indented, and it has a sweet odour. The second is badly\r\nassorted as regards form and colour, and its odour less agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica coffee-berry is medium-sized, of a greenish blue colour,\r\nrather oblong, and smooth to the touch. It has a strong, agreeable\r\nsmell, and excellent flavour, and when carefully picked and sorted,\r\nfetches about the highest price of any kind.\r\n\r\nPorto Rico is a middle-sized coffee, of a pure and agreeable flavour;\r\nthe colour of the better sorts is a bluish green; and of the common,\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe West Indian and Brazilian coffees have a bluish or greenish-grey\r\ntint. This grey-green shade of the Western coffees is entirely deficient\r\nin those of Asia. The value of the berry in our wholesale markets is\r\nnot, therefore, a fictitious quality, as some imagine, but is real, and\r\ndepends first upon the texture and form of the berry or seed, secondly\r\non the colour, and thirdly the flavour. The texture of the berry and\r\nform, termed “style” by the coffee brokers, is so well defined and\r\npalpable to the initiated, that at one view they pronounce its value,\r\nfrom one hundred and thirty shillings per cwt. downwards, according to\r\nthe two other qualities, colour and flavour.\r\n\r\nThe value of the coffees usually imported into this country stands in\r\nthe following order: Mocha, fine Ceylon Plantation, Jamaica, Costa Rica,\r\nJava, Tellicherry, and St. Domingo.\r\n\r\nPortugal produces coffee in several of her colonies. Ordinary\r\ndescription, yellowish berry, in St. Thomas; tolerably good in the Cape\r\nde Verdes; bad, yellow, in Timor; worse (but curious from the very small\r\nsize of the berry), growing wild, in Mozambique; good in Angola; and of\r\nexcellent quality in Madeira and Porto Santo, but the production is\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nMuch of the coffee which finds its way into England as genuine Mocha is,\r\nin reality, Malabar coffee, sent to ports of the Persian Gulf from\r\nBourbon, and when thus naturalised, finding its way to Europe. But the\r\ncoffee of India even now competes successfully with that of Arabia, in\r\nBussorah, and other local markets, which the latter had for centuries\r\ncommanded as its own.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to watch the progress of English enterprise. The energetic\r\nand ubiquitous Anglo-Saxons hold India, and here we see coffee from\r\nIndia triumphing over the famous berry of Arabia. The cultivation of tea\r\nalso is rapidly spreading over 30,000 square miles of the Sub-Himalayan\r\nranges; and who knows but that Indian teas may yet compete with those of\r\nthe flowery land in the markets of Shanghae?\r\n\r\nAlready the Assam teas are held in high estimation by good judges of tea\r\nin this country, whilst they fetch a high price in India for local\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the berry is by no means a decisive criterion of\r\nexcellence of quality; in some parts the bluish berry is esteemed most\r\nhighly, in others the yellow. The West Indian coffees often change\r\ncolour when kept a few years.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the various sorts of coffee imported into Europe\r\nfrom the several parts where the plant is cultivated differ widely in\r\nquality and flavour. Levantine or Mocha still retains its old\r\nsuperiority in this respect, though the best sorts imported from Ceylon,\r\nBourbon, Mauritius, and other Indian Islands are now generally\r\nconsidered to come very near it. This difference in quality and flavour\r\nof the various sorts of coffee is generally attributed to climatic and\r\nlocal causes and influences, which are necessarily beyond the power of\r\nremedy. This, however, is a great mistake. The more or less advanced\r\nstate of maturity to which the berry is allowed to attain before\r\npicking, and, more particularly still, the degree of dryness, and the\r\nlonger or shorter period of time for which it is kept before being sent\r\ninto the market, exercise a most powerful influence upon the quality and\r\nflavour of the article. Berries gathered before they have attained\r\nmaturity, though they may be perfect in colour, will always have a raw,\r\nherbaceous taste. If the drying berries are heaped too thickly or\r\nclosely, they are apt to heat and to contract an unpleasantly bitter and\r\nharsh taste, and a disagreeable smell; this will frequently occur also\r\nwhere artificial heat is had recourse to expedite the drying. Keeping\r\ntends to cure these serious defects in coffee. There are instances on\r\nrecord where coffee of a most disagreeable flavour and smell has been\r\nbrought near perfection by being kept for some years in a dry loft; and\r\nthough it may be going too far to assert, as has been done by some high\r\nauthorities on the subject, that “the worst coffee produced in the West\r\nIndies will, in a course of years not exceeding ten or fourteen, be as\r\ngood, parch and mix as well, and have as high a flavour as the best we\r\nhave now from Turkey,” still there can be no doubt that long keeping\r\nwill most materially improve the quality of even the worst sorts.\r\nUnfortunately, the difference of price between inferior and superior\r\ncoffee is not sufficiently great to cover so many years’ interest on the\r\ncapital invested. It is for the same reason that planters, though they\r\nare perfectly aware that trees growing on a light soil, and in dry and\r\nelevated spots, produce smaller berries of very superior flavour to\r\nthose grown in rich, flat, and moist soils, yet prefer cultivating the\r\nlatter, simply because the production is double that of the better sort.\r\nThose who wish to improve the quality of their coffees by keeping, must\r\nbear in mind that perfect dryness of the loft or warehouse, moderate\r\nwarmth, and gentle ventilation are the indispensable conditions of\r\nsuccess; a strong draught of air is more particularly to be guarded\r\nagainst, as it tends to bleach the berries. Great care must be taken,\r\nalso, to keep all strong-flavoured wares, such as pepper, pimento,\r\nginger, cod-fish, herrings, rum, &c., as far as possible from the\r\ncoffee, which has a powerful attraction for these scents, and gets\r\nthoroughly impregnated with them, to the great deterioration, of course,\r\nof its quality. This remark applies more particularly to the shipping of\r\ncoffee from Jamaica and the other West India Islands. Want of proper\r\nventilation in the holds in which a cargo of coffee is stowed on board\r\nship, is equally injurious to the quality of the article. Coffee which\r\nhas suffered damage by sea-water, or has been spoiled by the close\r\nvicinity of strong-scented wares, may, to some extent, be reclaimed by\r\n“rouncing” or putting it in a tub, pouring boiling water over it,\r\nstirring for a few minutes, then pouring the water off, repeating the\r\nsame operation a second, or even a third time, if necessary, and most\r\ncarefully drying the washed berries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoffee has been analysed by several chemists, and though the results\r\nobtained differ in some slight degree, yet it seems pretty clear that\r\nthe principal constituents to which its hygienic and medicinal\r\nproperties are due are caffeine, a peculiar volatile oil generated in\r\nthe roasting, and a kind of tannic acid.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid caffeine, or theine, is found in one or two other plants\r\nbesides tea and coffee. It occurs in the seeds of _Paullinia sorbilis_,\r\na native of Brazil, and in the leaves of several species of holly,\r\nnatives of South America, which furnish the Paraguay tea, or Yerba mate,\r\nso large an article of consumption in several of the South American\r\nrepublics. The leaves and young shoots, dried, parched, and pulverised,\r\nare used for a hot infusion. A kind of cake, called Guarana bread, is\r\nmade from the seeds of the _Paullinia_, which is highly esteemed in\r\nBrazil and other countries when infused, like chocolate, for its\r\nnutritive and febrifuge properties, and is sold generally as a necessary\r\nfor travellers, and as a cure for many diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive and medicinal virtues of all these plants must certainly\r\nbe attributed in a great degree to the presence of this chemical\r\nprinciple, and to the tannic acid which they also contain.\r\n\r\nThe use of coffee as a beverage has been examined in a chemical and\r\nphysiological point of view by Professor Lehmann. The general results of\r\nhis investigations are:\r\n\r\n1. That a decoction of coffee exercises two principal actions upon the\r\norganism, which are very diverse in character, viz. increasing the\r\nactivity of the vascular and nervous system, while at the same time it\r\nretards the metamorphosis of plastic constituents.\r\n\r\n2. That the influence of coffee upon the vascular and nervous system,\r\nits reinvigorating action, and the production of a general sense of\r\ncheerfulness and animation, is attributable solely to the mutual\r\nmodification of the specific action of the empyreumatic oil and the\r\ncaffeine contained in it.\r\n\r\n3. That the retardation of the assimilative process brought about by the\r\nuse of coffee is owing chiefly to the empyreumatic oil, and is caused by\r\ncaffeine only when taken in large quantities.\r\n\r\n4. That increased action of the heart, trembling, headache, &c., are\r\neffects of the caffeine.\r\n\r\n5. That the increased activity of the kidneys, relaxation of the bowels,\r\nand an increased vigour of mental faculties, passing into congestion,\r\nrestlessness, and inability to sleep, are effects of the empyreumatic\r\noil.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lehmann considers it, therefore, necessary to regard the\r\naction of coffee, and, in a less degree, that of tea, cocoa, alcohol,\r\n&c., upon the organism, as constituting an exception to the general law,\r\nthat increased bodily and mental activity involves increased consumption\r\nof plastic material.\r\n\r\nCaffeine, on careful analysis, has been found to contain in 100 parts,\r\n49·80 of carbon, 5·08 of hydrogen, 28·83 of nitrogen, and 16·29 of\r\noxygen. It is inodorous, but has a slightly bitter taste. The proportion\r\nin which this principle is found to be present in coffee varies between\r\n¾ lb. and 1¾ lbs. in 100 lbs. of berries.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar essential oil which is generated in coffee in the process\r\nof roasting, by the action of heat upon some yet unascertained principle\r\ncontained in the berry, is also very similar to the volatile oil in\r\ntea; but the quantity of it in coffee appears to be comparatively very\r\nsmall; for whilst 100 lbs. of tea-leaves contain 1 lb. of volatile oil,\r\nit takes 500 cwts. of roasted coffee to give a similar quantity; and yet\r\nit is upon the presence of this oil that the flavour and value of the\r\nseveral varieties of coffee mainly depend.\r\n\r\nThe tannic acid is, by some chemists, also said to be generated only in\r\nthe process of roasting; others maintain that it is present in the raw\r\nbean.\r\n\r\nThe chemical properties of the coffee-berry are altered by roasting, and\r\nit loses about twenty per cent. of weight, but increases in bulk\r\none-third or one-half. Its peculiar aroma, and some of its other\r\nproperties, are due to a small quantity of essential oil, only one\r\nfive-thousandth part of its weight, which would be worth about 100_l._\r\nan ounce in a separate state. Coffee is less rich in theine than tea,\r\nbut contains more sugar and a good deal of cheese (casein).\r\n\r\nSchrader has analysed raw and roasted coffee, with the following result:\r\n\r\n                               raw.   roasted.\r\n  Peculiar coffee principle    17·58   12·50\r\n  Gum and mucilage              3·64   10·42\r\n  Extractive                    0·62    4·80\r\n  Resin                         0·41 }\r\n  Fatty oil                     0·52 }  2·08\r\n  Solid residue                66·66   68·75\r\n  Loss                         10·57    1·45\r\n                               -------------\r\n                                     |\r\n                                   100·00\r\n\r\n“The examination of coffee,” observes Dr. F.

Lebreton (“Agriculteur praticien”) has estimated the loss of weight\r\nof coffee in roasting at 18 to 20 per cent. in Porto Rico, Rio, and\r\nMartinique coffee; and at 16 to 18 per cent. in Malabar, Bourbon,\r\nCeylon, and Guadaloupe coffees; while in Mocha coffee it amounts to only\r\n14 or 16. The loss of weight depends upon the time of roasting and the\r\ndegree of heat. Damp or damaged coffee loses more than dry sound coffee.\r\nHe considers that these substances have the capability of rendering the\r\nindividual insensible of a certain deficiency of food, in virtue of\r\ntheir retardation of the assimilative process. He thinks it probable,\r\nlikewise, that these substances have a direct nutritive value,\r\nespecially coffee as drank by the Turks and Arabs with the grounds.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lehmann considers that the singular preference for one or\r\nother of these beverages by particular nations, as well as the Eastern\r\ncustom of drinking coffee with the grounds, are not accidental, but have\r\nsome deeper reason. This reason, he thinks, is to be found in the\r\ndifferent effects of the coffee, tea, &c., and the various requirements\r\nof the nations by whom they are used, and instances the use of tea by\r\nthe English, and of coffee by the Germans and French, as in accordance\r\nwith this view. The diet of the former affords a larger supply of\r\nplastic material than that of the latter people; and while,\r\nconsequently, the retardation of the assimilative process is an\r\nimportant influence for the German, the proportionately greater nervous\r\nstimulus caused by tea is more desirable for the former. The use of\r\ncoffee with its grounds has its analogue in the use of tea mixed with\r\nmeal, milk, and butter among the Mongols, and other inhabitants of the\r\nCentral Asiatic steppes.\r\n\r\nM. Payen, from elaborate experiments, shows that coffee slightly roasted\r\nis that which contains the maximum of aroma, weight, and nutrition. He\r\ndeclares coffee to be very nourishing, as it contains a large quantity\r\nof nitrogen, three times as much nutriment as tea, and more than twice\r\nthe nourishment of soup. Chicory contains only half the nutriment of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE-LEAF TEA, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention was some time ago drawn to the subject of coffee-leaf tea,\r\nwhich is used in Sumatra and other parts of the East, and a good deal of\r\ndiscussion ensued upon the matter, after the leaves were shown for the\r\npurpose at the International Exhibition of 1851. An infusion of roasted\r\ncoffee-leaves is pronounced by those who have had an opportunity of\r\ntasting it, as superior to Bohea, and by some enthusiastic admirers is\r\nsaid to rival the flavour of the most delicate Pekoe. That an infusion\r\nof roasted coffee-leaves should imitate the flavour of tea is not to be\r\nwondered at, as the leaves of both shrubs contain in the main the same\r\nleading principles, more particularly theine or caffeine. There is no\r\ndoubt that coffee-leaf tea would command a sale in England, but the\r\nquestion is how much could be collected to make it profitable, and it\r\ninvolves the necessity of apparatus and skilled labour for parching the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nCoffee-leaves are not quite so thick as those of Vallambrosa, and a\r\nMalabar coolie would not in one day collect enough to pay the expense of\r\npicking, drying, packing, cartage, warehouse rent, freight, and other\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no planter of any experience would think of stripping his\r\ntrees of their breathing organs, and the quantity that might be\r\ncollected from the suckers and prunings, &c., would never give more than\r\na few bales, even on large plantations. Even were the fallen leaves\r\nsupposed to be available, their removal would be as detrimental as the\r\npractice of raking away withered leaves in plantations, or the\r\napplication of the sugar-cane trash to the purposes of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe husks, pulp, and parchment in South America, the West Indies,\r\nCeylon, and the other Indian islands, are regarded as mere waste, and\r\nthrown away. In Arabia and some parts of the East, however, this refuse\r\nis utilised, as the “miserables,” or husks of the cocoa-seed (_Theobroma\r\ncacao_), are in Ireland and the Continent. With it is prepared the\r\nfamous kisher, or “Café à la Sultane,” a light-coloured, bright\r\ninfusion, which has all the agreeable flavour of coffee, with little of\r\nits strength and none of its bitterness; this is partaken of by the\r\nhumbler classes in incredible quantities.\r\n\r\nWhen quite dry and ripe these husks are bruised, and roasted in an\r\nearthen vessel over a charcoal fire, not as coffee usually is, but only\r\nuntil it assumes a light-brown colour. While hot it is thrown into a pot\r\nof boiling water, with a small proportion of the pellicle or parchment\r\nskin; all is boiled together for a few minutes, and then served hot and\r\nstrong, but without sugar. Sometimes a drop of essence of amber is put\r\ninto each cup; or cloves, aniseed, or cardamoms are boiled with it.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, from the sweet pulp which envelopes the berry an excellent\r\nspirit has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nADULTERANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as the consumption of coffee is in Europe and the Americas, it has\r\nbecome so necessary in every household, that the demand continues to\r\nincrease, and very full prices are maintained. The largely extended\r\nplantations in Brazil, in Ceylon, in India, in Java, and in other\r\nsuitable localities, profitably opened up every day, altogether fail to\r\nkeep down prices, and will long continue to offer the strong inducement\r\nof large profits!\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this great public want, the unscrupulous and\r\nfraudulent trader foists upon the easily-duped masses of consumers vast\r\nquantities of unwholesome and pernicious stuff, mixed in certain\r\nproportions with coffee; and, although the law has interposed in the\r\ncase of chicory, forbidding, under penalties, its being sold mixed with\r\ncoffee, unless especially so labelled and declared, yet who can tell the\r\nthousand and one mixtures that are still made and sold with it?\r\n\r\nIt may be said that all this can be prevented by purchasing only\r\nunground coffee, in a roasted state, ready for grinding; but there are\r\nthose (to be reckoned by hundreds of thousands of families) who, having\r\nno means of grinding this roasted coffee, are compelled to buy that\r\nwhich is already ground, or go without altogether.\r\n\r\nWhat abominations do these (in too many cases) not drink, then, under\r\nthe much abused name of _coffee_?\r\n\r\nThese reflections are forced upon my mind every time I enter a\r\ncoffee-house, and am called to put faith in the purity of the cup of\r\ncoffee set before me.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the establishments of coffee-grinders speak of bags of the\r\nhusks of peas, and cobs of Indian corn, wheat, sea-biscuits, and other\r\narticles, harmless enough in themselves, and in their right places,\r\nwhere, indeed, they may be useful; but a coffee-mill is the wrong place\r\nfor these otherwise objectionable articles of consumption. It will not\r\nbe denied that the husks of peas or the cobs of maize are appropriately\r\nplaced in the trough from which our pigs feed; they will even add to the\r\ndelicacy and whiteness of the pork those very useful animals are\r\nintended to yield us, but they are essentially out of place in our\r\ncoffee-cup. These, and various other articles, go to make what in the\r\ntrade is termed “Boston,” and this preparation the visitor, who has been\r\nadmitted to the arcana of the grinder, will find mixed in a large bin\r\nready for use. One who has been thus favoured, after describing the mill\r\nused for grinding the coffee, speaks of another machine, called the\r\n“mixer.” The “mixer” is a wooden cylinder revolving on a spindle at an\r\nangle of 45°, and having internal arrangements to mix the coffee with\r\nsuch proportion of adulterating material as the ingenuity or impudence\r\nof the grinder may suggest. Here, like Macbeth’s witches over their\r\ncauldron, presides the genius of the place, who casts in the ingredients\r\nwhich constitute the villanous compound, which, done up in tins, is\r\nfinally ornamented with labels such as this:\r\n\r\n                       FINEST PLANTATION COFFEE,\r\n\r\n         Roasted and ground on the most approved principle by\r\n\r\n                           STEAM MACHINERY.\r\n\r\nThis coffee is with confidence highly recommended to the public, as the\r\nfine aroma, so much appreciated, is entirely preserved by its being\r\n\r\n                      PACKED FRESH FROM THE MILL.\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely say that the amount of nourishment contained in this\r\nabominable _olio_ is infinitesimally small.\r\n\r\nThe _Scientific American_ of New York, of a recent date, records the\r\nfollowing fact: “The editor of the _Baltimore American_ lately visited\r\nthe commissary department of one of the large military hospitals, and\r\nnoticed several barrels of dried coffee grounds, the purpose whereof\r\nexcited his curiosity. The polite commissary informed him that they\r\nreceived twelve dollars a barrel for the grounds. ‘But what is it\r\npurchased for?’ he asked. ‘Well,’ said the commissary, hesitatingly, ‘it\r\nis re-aromatised by the transforming hand of modern chemistry, and put\r\nup in pound papers, which are decorated with attractive labels and\r\nhigh-sounding names.’”\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago, when the question of coffee adulteration was much\r\nagitated, I published a little treatise, entitled, “Coffee, as it is and\r\nas it ought to be,” in which, among other particulars, I pointed out the\r\nvarious sophistications practised. A compositor who was engaged in\r\nprinting the work furnished me with a remarkable statement in\r\nconfirmation of reports which I had previously heard.\r\n\r\nHe stated that in various parts of the metropolis, but more especially\r\nin the east, are to be found liver bakers. These men take the livers of\r\noxen and horses, bake them, and grind them into a powder, which they\r\nsell to the low-priced coffee-shop keepers, at from 4d. to 6d. per\r\npound; horse-liver coffee bearing the highest price. This adulterant may\r\nbe known by allowing the coffee to stand until cold, when a thick\r\npellicle or skin will be found on the top. It goes farther than coffee,\r\nand is generally mixed with chicory and other vegetable imitations of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of Dr. Hassall (“Food and its\r\nAdulterations”), the several adulterations of coffee may be\r\ndistinguished by the following characters:\r\n\r\nChicory, by the size, form, and ready separation of the component cells\r\nof the root, as well as by the presence of an abundance of spiral\r\nvessels of the dotted form.\r\n\r\nRoasted corn, by the size, form, and other characters of the starch\r\ngranules, of which the grains are principally composed. Beans, also, by\r\nthe form, &c., of the constituent granules of starch. Potato, by the\r\nlarge size, rounded form, and ready separation of the cells of the\r\ncellulose, as well as by the fibrous markings on their surfaces.\r\n\r\nPlate 3 shows a fragment of roasted coffee as seen under the microscope,\r\nmagnified 140 diameters, and the structures in a sample of coffee\r\nadulterated with chicory.\r\n\r\nDr. Normandy, in his evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on the\r\nAdulteration of Food, &c., stated that he had met with roasted corn in\r\ncoffee to an extent of from 25 to 30 per cent.; it is recognised by the\r\nsize and character of the starch granules; consists of barley and rye,\r\nand is generally very easy to detect; it floats up. If coffee has been\r\nadulterated with roasted grain, when you pour boiling water upon it you\r\nwill see rising against the sides of the cup portions of the ground\r\ngrain, which you sometimes can separate in considerable quantities, by\r\ncapillary attraction. If you pour such coffee from the coffee-pot, some\r\nof those grains will fall with the liquid in the cup, and they will\r\nclimb up, as it were, the sides of the cup a quarter of an inch, or\r\nsomething of that kind, all round, and you can collect them very easily.\r\n\r\nDr. R. D. Thompson, F.R.S., another witness, stated that a large cargo\r\nof lupins from Egypt having been imported, which could not be made any\r\nuse of in consequence of their bitter taste, he was asked to give a\r\ncertificate in favour of their being equal to coffee, but declined, and\r\nrecommended that, after steeping, to remove the bitter principle, they\r\nshould be sold for cattle. He also added that he had seen an ingenious\r\napparatus for making artificial coffee-berries from chicory and other\r\nsubstances; it was something like a bullet-mould, and patented by\r\nMessrs. Duckworth of Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe chicory itself sold is not always pure. The Board of Inland Revenue\r\nhave found, on chemical examination in different samples, beans, rye,\r\noats (roasted and ground), caramel or burnt sugar, oxide of iron and\r\norange berries.\r\n\r\nThe principle contained in coffee, remarks Dr. Letheby, may be\r\nconsidered as essential to life, inasmuch as all nations\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 3\r\n\r\nGenuine Ground Coffee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coffee Adulterated with Chicory.]\r\n\r\nuse it; it prevents the wear and tear of the body. Now there is nothing\r\nin chicory which can do that. Chemically there is no difference between\r\nbeetroot chicory and what is called real chicory; microscopically you\r\ncan discover the difference. If genuine coffee is sprinkled upon the\r\nsurface of a tumbler of water, it remains a considerable time floating,\r\nand when it sinks it only slightly colours the water; chicory, on the\r\nother hand, sinks quickly, and colours the water very deeply. Ground\r\ncoffee is enveloped in an oily substance, which prevents the water\r\nabsorbing; chicory has no such protection, and sinks immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips, the chemist to the Inland Board of Revenue, states that\r\nthe average per-centage of chicory to coffee, when sold mixed, was found\r\nto range from 20½ to 16¾ per cent.\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the British Association of Science, Mr. Horsley\r\ncalled attention to the use of bi-chromate of potash, in analysing\r\nadulterated samples of coffee. With diluted solutions of pure coffee,\r\nthis salt produces an intense deep porter-brown coloration, whilst upon\r\ndecoctions of chicory no effect is produced. He advised the following\r\nprocedure: Take equal parts of chicory and coffee, and decoct them in\r\ndifferent quantities of water. Filter, bottle, and label the liquids.\r\nTake a teaspoonful of the chicory, and dilute till it is of a brown\r\nsherry colour; boil it in a porcelain dish, with a fragment of\r\ncrystallised bi-chrome. The colour will be scarcely deepened. If a\r\nsimilarly diluted solution of coffee is thus treated, a deep-brown tinge\r\nis obtained. By operating with mixed liquids a scale of colours may be\r\nobtained indicating the properties of the two substances. If a few\r\ngrains of the sulphate of copper be added, both decoctions yield a\r\nprecipitate; that from chicory being a clay yellow, and that from coffee\r\na sepia brown. Mixed decoctions yield intermediate tints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nCULTURE IN THE WEST INDIES AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1720, a small coffee-plant, raised in the garden of the King at\r\nParis, was transported to the Antilles by Captain Declieux, who, during\r\na long passage, shared each day his small allowance of water with the\r\nyoung coffee plant. From this tree have sprung all those since\r\ncultivated in Martinique, Guadaloupe, Cayenne, St. Domingo, and the\r\nother islands. The fall of St. Domingo, in 1789, which formerly\r\nfurnished 80,000,000 lbs., the disfavour the culture has fallen into in\r\nMartinique and Guadaloupe islands, which used to supply 16,000,000 or\r\n17,000,000 lbs., together with the greater attention given to sugar\r\ncultivation in the West Indies, have transferred the production of\r\ncoffee chiefly to Brazil, Ceylon, and Java.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, 526,000 cwts. of coffee were imported into Great Britain from\r\nthe West Indies, and the average annual imports in the six years ending\r\n1806 was 364,000 cwts. The decrease of production is shown by the\r\nfollowing figures:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n                 |    1829.   |    1850.   |    1860.\r\n  ---------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n                 |     lbs.   |     lbs.   |     lbs.\r\n  Jamaica        | 18,690,654 |  4,196,210 |  6,145,362\r\n  British Guiana |  7,163,016 |     18,472 |     --\r\n  Trinidad       |     73,667 |     96,376 |     --\r\n  Dominica       |    942,113 |        792 |     10,000\r\n  St. Lucia      |    303,499 |         39 |     --\r\n  ---------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nJAMAICA.--The coffee-plant is said to have been first introduced into\r\nJamaica by Sir Nicholas Lawes, in 1728, when it was cultivated on an\r\nestate called Temple Hall, on the plains of Liguanea, not far from\r\nKingston. In 1752, 6,000,000 lbs. of coffee were exported, and in the\r\nthree years ending 1807, the average annual shipment was 28,500,000 lbs.\r\nIt was not until the island trade was injured by the dismemberment of\r\nHonduras that the heavy duties on sugar, and the competition of the\r\nFrench colonies, induced the industrious planters to turn their\r\nattention to coffee. They then petitioned for a protecting bounty, and\r\nfor a considerable time this was the only British colony where its\r\ncultivation was much attended to. In 1791 there were 607\r\ncoffee-plantations in the island, with 21,000 negroes employed on them.\r\nIn 1844, there were 671 plantations, and it was calculated that\r\n20,000,000_l._ sterling was invested in them. Some of the finest and\r\nmost productive plantations were at an elevation of 4700 feet, in the\r\nvicinity of the Blue Mountain Peak. Whilst in 1809, 83,250,000 lbs. of\r\ncoffee were shipped from Jamaica, the average export for ten years past\r\nhas not exceeded 6,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and Central America a nursery of young plants is\r\nusually raised from seed. At the age of six months these are\r\ntransplanted into the field in squares of 8 to 9 feet apart. Beyond\r\nkeeping the field clear of weeds, giving the plants a slight moulding,\r\nand freeing them of suckers or sprouts, they do not require any other\r\nattention for the first three years. At the expiry of this time they\r\ncommence to bear fruit, and the coffee is cured either by drying the\r\nentire fruit in the sun, or by passing the fruit through what is called\r\na pulping mill, which separates the outer pulp or covering from the\r\nbeans. The beans are then subjected to a washing in a tank full of\r\nwater, in order to remove the glutinous substance which adheres to them;\r\nthis causes them to cure or dry more rapidly. They are then left in what\r\nis called the parchment husk, and exposed to the action of the sun on\r\nplatforms laid with tiles, until they are perfectly dried, and from this\r\nthey are, during crop time, spread on the wooden floors of a building\r\ncalled a logie, to the depth, in a heavy crop, of 12 to 18 inches.\r\nWhilst thus spread, great attention is necessary to prevent the coffee\r\ngetting heated and its colour destroyed, by constantly turning it up,\r\nand by the use of some dry lime or ashes sprinkled over it. After this\r\nthe beans are subjected to the operation of what is called a stamping\r\nmill, which separates the parchment husk from the beans. This stamping\r\nmill is merely two large solid wheels fixed on each end of a beam on an\r\naxle, and worked by mules moving round in a circle--the wooden wheels\r\nworking in a circular trough filled with the coffee beans. After this\r\nthe whole are submitted to the action of a winnowing machine, which\r\nseparates the chaff from the beans, and subsequently the beans are\r\npassed through copper sieves to separate the perfect from the broken\r\ncoffee, and finally handpicked and put into bags or casks for shipment.\r\n\r\nBRITISH GUIANA.--Coffee was for a length of time almost the only staple\r\nof Berbice and Demerara, but the cultivation of the sugar-cane has been\r\nsubstituted for it. The quantity of coffee, the produce of British\r\nGuiana, exported in 1830 was, 9,472,756 lbs.; in 1840, 3,357,300 lbs.;\r\nin 1849, 100,550 lbs.; and in 1850, 30,000 lbs.; since which it has\r\nalmost ceased to be exported, scarcely sufficient being produced to\r\nsupply the demand in the colony.\r\n\r\nAt one time there were about two hundred coffee plantations in the small\r\nisland of DOMINICA, and four to five million of pounds of coffee were\r\nexported annually to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO.--In proportion to its extent, this island is twice as\r\nproductive as Cuba, and the quality of its coffee and other produce is\r\nof the highest class. There were, in 1862, fifty-three coffee\r\nplantations on the island, producing about 100,000 cwt. of coffee. The\r\nexports of coffee were, in\r\n\r\n                 lbs.\r\n  1855       11,506,283\r\n  1856        9,935,000\r\n  1857        8,245,000\r\n  1858        9,814,000\r\n  1859       13,457,000\r\n\r\nThe exports of coffee from the island of CUBA, which were in 1840\r\nupwards of 2,000,000 arrobas, were in 1858 but 21,000; and in 1859, 5000\r\nor 6000.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL.--The coffee-plant has been known in Brazil for many years; it is\r\nbut about fifty years, however, since the first regular plantation was\r\nmade by Mr. Moke, a Belgian, who brought the cultivation of coffee to\r\ngreat perfection. His plantation is still in the neighbourhood of the\r\ncapital, and is carried on by his son with much success. It is\r\nastonishing to what an extent coffee has been cultivated since Mr. Moke\r\nfirst made his plantation. Two millions of bags of 160 lbs. each are\r\nannually exported from Rio de Janeiro, taking the average of the last\r\nseven years; 1862 was, however, short of this about half a million bags.\r\nAt Barahyba do Sul, which is within a few miles of Rio, there are\r\nplantations employing six and seven hundred slaves.\r\n\r\nThe best plantations are those owned and conducted by\r\nforeigners--chiefly English, French, and Belgian--they have an air of\r\nneatness and comfort about them of which those owned by Brazilians and\r\nPortuguese are totally destitute. The foreigners use improved machinery\r\nalso in preparing the berry for market, which the Brazilians, with some\r\nexceptions, do not. The coffee-berry contains two seeds, covered with a\r\ngummy, mucilaginous substance, and enclosed in a skin which is thick,\r\nsweet, and dark and red when ripe. The foreigners take off this skin by\r\nmeans of machinery, and the beans are washed until they are divested of\r\nthe mucilage which covers them. They are then dried and put into bags\r\nready for market. The Brazilians dry the beans with the skin on. In the\r\nprocess of drying, the skin first becomes dark, and finally black, and\r\nwhen crisp, is rubbed off the bean, which is then washed. In this\r\nprocess, however, there is great danger of fermentation. The skin\r\ncontains a vast amount of saccharine matter, and successful attempts\r\nhave been made to extract from it sugar and spirit; but either through\r\npoor machinery, or other mismanagement, it was found to be unprofitable,\r\nand the experiment was abandoned. The skin is exceedingly sweet, almost\r\nas much so to the taste as the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-plant can be propagated from the seed, but the most prevalent\r\nmethod in Brazil is by young plants, which may be had by the thousand on\r\nold plantations. The young shrub is taken up in August--generally when\r\nit is about two years old--and planted in good soil. The fourth year it\r\nproduces coffee, and the fifth year it commences to bear regular crops,\r\nthe yield being from a pound and a half to three pounds per tree. Trees\r\nhave been known to last for many years on good rich soil, and some on\r\nMr. Moke’s plantation are still bearing which were planted forty years\r\nago; on hill-sides, however, where the soil is light, the plant decays\r\nin the course of eight or ten years. The picking season commences in\r\nJuly, and in the low lands generally concludes by the end of August;\r\namong the hills, however, where there are frequent showers, and where\r\nthere is much shade, the season does not close until some time in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThe four coffee-growing provinces of Brazil, properly speaking, are Rio\r\nde Janeiro, San Paulo, Minas, and Bahia. In the two former the\r\nagriculturists have for some time past directed their attention almost\r\nexclusively to this article. In Bahia its cultivation is steadily,\r\nalthough slowly, increasing. Coffee is grown in the provinces of\r\nMaranham, Parana, and St. Catherine’s, but only to a very small extent,\r\nthe amount produced being insufficient to meet the demand. The\r\ncultivation of coffee is rapidly increasing in St. Paulo, and is\r\npromoted by the railroad extending from Santos to Jundiahy. The United\r\nStates usually takes one-half of the crop of Brazil coffee.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the average quantity of coffee exported from\r\nthe empire of Brazil during the undermentioned years, comprising a\r\nperiod previous and subsequent to the abolition of the slave trade in\r\n1851, and showing a steady increase in the export since 1840:\r\n\r\n               Annual average.\r\n                  arrobas.\r\n\r\n  1840-43        5,507,367\r\n  1843-46        6,519,380\r\n  1846-49        9,301,967\r\n  1849-52        8,542,965\r\n  1852-55       10,549,847\r\n  1855-58       11,465,719\r\n  1858-61       10,501,665\r\n\r\nThe yearly shipments from Rio in the last four years have been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n              bags.\r\n  1859      2,064,837\r\n  1860      2,150,188\r\n  1861      2,085,974\r\n  1862      1,477,904\r\n\r\nbesides 200,000 to 300,000 bags annually from Santos. The bags contain\r\nrather more than six arrobas, or one cwt. and a half.\r\n\r\nCOSTA RICA.--The quality of this coffee is recognised as excellent. In\r\norder to place it in a proper degree of estimation in foreign markets,\r\nsome proprietors of plantations have not omitted getting it chemically\r\nanalysed in Europe; the result of which examination has classed it in\r\nthe third degree, among those kinds generally esteemed as the best.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the production of coffee in Costa Rica; the\r\nbulk of the crop is sent to Great Britain:\r\n\r\n               cwts.\r\n  1854        70,000\r\n  1855        70,709\r\n  1856        83,000\r\n  1857        95,000\r\n\r\nVENEZUELA.--Within the last thirty years Venezuela has made great\r\nprogress in coffee culture. The exports, which were not more than\r\n13,000,000 lbs. in 1833, had risen to 15,000,000 lbs. in 1850; but since\r\nthen the culture has been much interfered with by civil war. The exports\r\nfrom La Guayra were, in 1855, 17,375,000 lbs.; in 1856, 12,357,000 lbs.;\r\nand in 1857, 16,031,000 lbs. Washed coffee sells there at 8s. per cwt.\r\nhigher than the unwashed.\r\n\r\nIn Venezuela, the plan followed in drying the coffee is this. The\r\nberries are spread out upon hurdles in the sun, where they undergo the\r\nvinous fermentation from fourteen to twenty days, and then dry. The\r\nbeans are freed from the pulpy husk by a mill in two operations, and\r\nfrom the parchment, &c., by winnowing. Although a single tree may bear\r\nas much as 10 to 20 lbs., the average in Venezuela is under 2 lbs. An\r\nacre planted with 2560 trees yields there an annual crop of about 1100\r\nlbs. of dry beans.\r\n\r\nIn ECUADOR coffee has of late greatly engrossed the attention of\r\nplanters, from its superior quality and the increased demand; it\r\ncommands a higher price than any other product of the country in\r\nproportion. As the people are everywhere dedicating themselves to its\r\nculture, in a few years it is probable that this country will export a\r\nconsiderable quantity. In 1855, 776 cwt. only were shipped; in 1861,\r\nalthough the harvest was exceedingly scanty, the exports were 1480 cwt.\r\n\r\nGUATEMALA.--Some twenty years ago considerable plantations of coffee\r\nwere made in different parts of the republic of Guatemala, and had the\r\nundertaking been followed up with proper and steady constancy and\r\nattention, it might, perhaps, by this time, have become an important\r\narticle of export. Unfortunately its culture was abandoned, owing to the\r\ninsurrections of the Indian population. Some attempts have been made\r\nagain to introduce its culture by making fresh plantations, but hitherto\r\nnot to any extent worthy of mention. The exports of coffee in 1860 were\r\nabout 63 tons. In the department of Vera Paz, there are said to be now\r\nabout half a million of coffee plants in bearing, and nurseries of about\r\na million more plants will soon be ready for transplanting. The greater\r\npart of the plantations are situated in the neighbourhood of Coban,\r\nwhere the vicinity of Teleman, on the river Polochec, which disembogues\r\ninto the gulf of Dulce, affords a convenient channel for shipping the\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nCULTURE IN ARABIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe culture of coffee is principally carried on in Yemen, towards the\r\ndistricts of Aden and Mocha. The nearest coffee plantations are about\r\neighty miles from Aden.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-growing country in the Yemen is 300 miles to the south of\r\nJeddah, being the districts about Tohira, Uodeida, and Tanaa. Of this,\r\nthe Turks have but little, their authority only extending over the\r\nnarrow slip called the Tehana, in which is little coffee. They had till\r\nlately the export dues of all the coffee grown in Western Arabia, but\r\nthey have lost a great part of them, a large quantity of coffee being\r\nsent to Aden for exportation. Mocha, the ancient port and capital, has\r\ncompletely fallen, and is in ruins. Its place is taken by Uodeida, the\r\nseat of government of the Yemen, and a Pashalic under Jeddah. In 1860,\r\ncoffee to the value of 14,268_l._ was imported into Aden by sea, of\r\n55,710_l._ was brought by land, and 45,344_l._ was exported. An enormous\r\nquantity is consumed in Arabia. Very little genuine Yemen coffee is\r\nprocurable in Europe. It is difficult to obtain even in Jeddah. It is\r\nfirst mixed in the Yemen with inferior Abyssinian coffee, then mixed at\r\nJeddah with damaged coffee, and probably in Egypt it is again mixed.\r\nAlexandria and Cairo are notorious for bad coffee.\r\n\r\nIt has been understood for several years that much of the coffee which\r\nfinds its way into England as genuine Mocha is, in reality, Malabar\r\ncoffee, sent to ports on the Persian Gulf from Bombay, and when thus\r\nnaturalised, finding its way to Europe. But the coffee of India is now\r\ncompeting successfully with that of Arabia in markets which the latter\r\nhad for centuries commanded as its own. In a few years the Indian\r\narticle will entirely surpass the Arabian. It is the old story of\r\nenterprise originated and directed by Europeans driving competition out\r\nof the market. Seeing that the Arabs are in the habit of baking the\r\ncow-dung and cakes for food on the same wall, they cannot be suspected\r\nof any violent antipathy to dirt _per se_. But, passionate lovers as\r\nthey are of a good cup of coffee, they can easily understand that an\r\nequal quantity of well-cleaned Malabar coffee is cheaper than that\r\nbrought in the buggalows of the Nijd Arabs, and which is described as\r\nfull of extraneous matter, such as pieces of the coffee-husk, &c. But\r\nthe Indian coffee is actually sold cheaper, quantity for quantity. The\r\nconsumption of Yemen coffee is now entirely confined to the wealthier\r\nchiefs; the finest kind, and that most sought after, being the small, of\r\na light-green colour. Latterly, the Yemen coffee has been all sent to\r\nBagdad, a compliment which the ancient city of the Sultans cannot fail\r\nto appreciate at its true value. It is too dear and too dirty for the\r\npoor Arabs of Bussorah, while the flavour of the Malabar kind is found\r\nclosely to approximate to that of Yemen.\r\n\r\nThe coffee is generally grown half way up the slopes of the hills, but\r\nsome is cultivated on lower ground, surrounded by large trees for shade.\r\nThe harvest is gathered at three periods of the year, the principal\r\nbeing in May. Cloths are spread under the trees, which are shaken, that\r\nthe ripe fruit may drop. The berries are then collected and exposed to\r\nthe sun on mats to dry. A heavy roller is afterwards passed over the\r\nberries, to break the envelopes, and the husk is winnowed away with a\r\nfan. The berries are further dried before being stored.\r\n\r\nArabian coffee was first cultivated by the Dutch, and some of their\r\nplants sent by the French to the West Indies, where it is now\r\nsuccessfully cultivated. So that one has a difficulty in deciding where\r\nit is indigenous, as it is a much more important article of agriculture\r\nin the West Indies, Java, Ceylon, and Southern India, than in its native\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn Syria the coffee-plant is of natural growth; but as the European\r\nwriters who were engaged in the Crusades do not mention it, it could not\r\nhave been much used during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Bruce\r\naffirms that the qualities of it were well known in Africa, and that the\r\nGallae, a wandering tribe, which was obliged to traverse the deserts,\r\ncarried no other provision than balls compounded of coffee and butter,\r\none of which would keep them in health and spirits through a day’s\r\njourney better than any other kind of food. In the Royal Library at\r\nParis is an Arabian manuscript, containing a voluminous history of\r\ncoffee, in which it is said that Gemaleddin-Ahou-Abdallah, Mufti of\r\nAden, first introduced its use among the Turks, upon his return from\r\nPersia, where he had experienced the beneficial effects of it as a\r\ncommon beverage. The effendi, the kadi, and all the inferior officers of\r\nthe government, followed the example of this chief of the law. The use\r\nof coffee descended through the harem to the house of every merchant,\r\nand the town of Aden set the example to the rest of Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION IN CEYLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1824, Sir Edward Barnes and Sir George Bird commenced coffee-planting\r\nin Ceylon on a large scale. Others followed gradually, but the real rush\r\nfor land dates from 1833. There are now 250,000 acres owned by\r\ncoffee-planters, of which 100,000 are cleared and cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon coffee succeeds best at an elevation from 1200 to 4800 feet;\r\nthe quantity, generally speaking, lessening, but the quality improving\r\nwith the elevation. By the natives a little of inferior description is\r\ngrown in the low country. In 1855 there were about 150 estates belonging\r\nto Europeans, comprising 30,000 acres of cultivated ground, to which\r\nconsiderable additions have since been made. 400,000 cwt. was exported\r\nin 1853, and 783,393 cwt. in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe railroad forming from Colombo to Kandy, and the opening up of new\r\nroads, have rendered more land accessible, and the large clearances made\r\nin the forest at the high elevations will probably so improve the\r\nclimate of those localities that a still further addition to the\r\navailable land will be obtained. It is, therefore, not too much to\r\nexpect the export, which in the last five years has on the average\r\nexceeded 630,000 cwt. per annum, will in less than a quarter of a\r\ncentury be more than doubled. In the fourteen years ending with 1862,\r\nCeylon has sent into the markets of the world the following quantity of\r\ncoffee:\r\n\r\n                       cwts.                      £\r\n  Plantation        4,625,995 of the value of 11,310,518\r\n  Native growth     1,945,623        “         3,492,290\r\n                    ---------                 ----------\r\n                    6,571,618                 14,802,808\r\n\r\nElevation must ever be an important consideration; though we have no\r\ndoubt that by the use of manures coffee might be made to do well and\r\nbear to a limited extent at the level of the sea in Ceylon. We believe\r\nthis to be, however, so completely artificial, that it will never again\r\nbe tried whilst land is available from 1500 feet and upwards of\r\nelevation, where the plant grows vigorously without more than ordinary\r\ncare being bestowed. The general effect of elevation may be described\r\nvery shortly; the lower ranges, with fair soil, produce the heaviest\r\ncrops and the soonest after planting, whilst the plantations on higher\r\nelevations produce smaller crops, but a finer quality of produce, and\r\ntake a longer time to come into full bearing. There are many\r\ncircumstances which go to produce climate, besides differences of\r\nelevation. On a plantation formed in a large district of forest yet\r\nuncleared, the climate will be colder and more moist than when the\r\nformation of other estates has cleared away the forest around it. The\r\nproximity of a high mountain peak, or being situated on the shoulder of\r\na mountain which towers to a great elevation above the level of the\r\nplantation, will also produce more cold and wet than if the garden were\r\nopened on a lower range and to the full height of such a position. Plate\r\n4, for instance, shows such a locality in the view of Konda-galla\r\nestate, near Neura-ellia, Ceylon. At low elevations long continued dry\r\nweather is more frequent than on the higher ranges, inasmuch as the\r\nclouds are frequently broken by the distant hills before they reach; and\r\nwhen there is no rain about, estates on the higher ranges are less\r\nparched, and atmospherically enjoy a moisture of which the lower hills\r\nare destitute. Still these various conditions are only advantageous or\r\nhurtful under varying circumstances; high elevation, cold and wet, and\r\nlow elevation, heat, and drought, are alike unfavourable as prevailing\r\ncharacteristics; it is their due and seasonable admixture\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 4.--Konda-galla Estate, near Neura-ellia,\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\nwhich is found most favourable to the profitable production of the\r\ncoffee-plant. Perhaps the least favourable localities are those high\r\npositions where the natural vegetation is of the alpine character; in\r\nsuch positions the plant will only struggle for an existence; it\r\ntherefore follows that the land selected should be well under these\r\nextreme elevations.\r\n\r\nSoil of all kinds has had its advocates, and in turn been condemned by\r\nall. Depth and freeness are perhaps its most favourable states; dark\r\nblack mould is always good; but wherever there is sufficiency of depth\r\nfound beneath a virgin forest, at the proper elevation and climate,\r\ncoffee has come on successfully. The land which has by general opinion\r\nbeen condemned as unfit for continued production is that covered with\r\nsmall jungle after the original forest has been cut down, and the land\r\nmade to produce a rich crop for the natives. Perhaps it may be the\r\nexposure of the soil to the sun, and exhaustion by the large weeds which\r\nit produces, which are so injurious to it. The modern system of manuring\r\nis rapidly equalising the value of all soils, though deep lands on a\r\nlimestone bottom, or strewed with granite boulders, are always\r\nconsidered highly favourable for coffee cultivation. The proximity of\r\nland to roads is a point of great importance in its selection, both as\r\ndirectly and indirectly affecting the outlay in forming a plantation,\r\nand probably for a long time determining the large item of expense under\r\nthe head of transport of produce.\r\n\r\nFelling and clearing, as the name implies, is cutting down the jungle\r\nand burning it off, so as to leave the land clear for planting. It is\r\nconducted as follows. Beginning from the lower part of the land and\r\nworking upwards, the undergrowth, or small jungle, is cut down with\r\ncatties or bill-hooks, leaving the forest trees free and open for the\r\nlabours of the axemen. Likewise beginning from the lowest part of the\r\nfield, the labourers, generally village Singhalese, who are extremely\r\nexpert at this work, cut the trees nearly through by notches at the\r\nlower and upper sides, gradually retiring up the hill, until a tree of\r\nlarger dimensions is cut, and being sent down, crashes all the others\r\nbeneath it. When this is cleverly managed, several acres will often be\r\nopened to the daylight at one time; much, however, depends upon the\r\nsteepness of the ascent and the heaviness of the forest. On the highest\r\nelevations the trees are smallest, and come down lightest, and on the\r\nlower elevations it may frequently happen that for acres and acres the\r\ntrees are of that immense size that every log has required four men to\r\ncut it from the stump. Not unfrequently some of these trees have such\r\nprojecting roots that the axemen have to erect stages around them to\r\nreach the ordinary trunk, which will each give employment for six hours\r\nto four men to cut through. After the trees have been felled, the\r\nlopping has to be attended to; this is to cut off all the tops and\r\nbranches, and in some cases to cut the trunks across, so that the mass\r\ncut down may lay compactly and dry, as upon this depends much of the\r\nsuccess of the burning, and, therefore, the economy of the operation.\r\nSmall or light forest is often the most expensive to lop, from the\r\nlifeless fall of the trees, and the comparatively greater quantity of\r\nhead and branch; whereas tall and heavy forest trees fly as it were\r\nunder the axe from the stump, and in falling break themselves and all\r\nbeneath them; in this manner some heavy forests cost less to clear than\r\na lighter growth. The clearing having been left from six weeks to about\r\ntwo months, according to the weather, is fired, which is done generally\r\nby setting fire to it chiefly at _the lower ends_ in several places; by\r\nthis means the fire is soon connected, and burning in the dryest or\r\nfirst cut down portions, unites in a sweeping flame, rushes up the hill,\r\ndestroying all before it; such is the power of the flame from below,\r\nthat when the burning is successful the part last cut, probably many\r\nacres, and yet lying green upon the ground, is consumed with the rest.\r\nAfter the flame has passed away, nothing should be seen but the smoking\r\nblack logs of the large trees, which, wherever they cross each other and\r\ndo not lay upon the ground, require to be cut across and brought down.\r\nIf the operation has been successfully managed, the land is now in\r\nreadiness for the next operation--_Lining_, or staking out the positions\r\nof the intended plants. This is performed in many ways, but it is\r\nessential to have it done well, that the plants should make perfect\r\nlines across the ground to be planted, in order to maintain regularity\r\nin the plantation work, and give the best possible appearance to the\r\nfield; therefore no expense necessary to ensure its correct and\r\nworkmanlike performance should be grudged. The simplest method is by\r\nmeans of a line, with marks placed at equal distances for the spaces\r\nbetween the plants up the hill. This carried by men at each end, who\r\nrespectively measure a distance with a rod for that purpose from the\r\nlast peg, and holding the line taught from end to end; boys following\r\nwith pegs ready cut put them in at the marks on the line. This method is\r\nlikely to lead to inaccuracy on a large feature, in consequence of the\r\nirregularity of the ground, and from the small inaccuracies accumulating\r\nin the measurement between each laying down of the line. A better way is\r\nto lay out a feature in squares of the line, and these into parallels\r\nacross the feature, and then drop the line between each peg on the\r\nparallels, putting in the remaining pegs by the marks on the line. Some\r\nplanters have an excellent plan of laying down a number of lines up and\r\ndown the hill at measured distances, and then two men with a shorter\r\nline measure distances upwards on the two outside lines, and peg-men put\r\nin their sticks at the points where the lines cross each other. We have\r\nseen some plantations laid out by the use of the theodolite, but this is\r\nnot an instrument to be found on many estates. The object to be gained\r\nin lining is to carry the plants in straight lines parallel to each\r\nother, at the same bearing over the whole estate, and to make them cross\r\neach other at right angles; by this means lines will be formed four\r\nways, at the two right angles and at the two diagonals. When this has\r\nbeen successfully achieved, there is, under any circumstances, a\r\nworkmanlike character about the plantation; vacancies in the planting\r\nare more easily detected, the arrangements for weeding, picking,\r\npruning, and manuring are made without confusion. Diagonal lines across\r\nthe features of land are said to be best, inasmuch as the stems of the\r\ntrees by this arrangement offer somewhat more resistance to the washing\r\ndown of soil by the rains.\r\n\r\nMuch argument has been held as to the proper distances at which\r\ncoffee-trees should be planted; and in visiting the various districts it\r\nwill be seen that all distances and all forms have been resorted to. The\r\nresult of this extended experiment has produced a very general opinion\r\nin favour of close planting; that is, 6 feet by 6 feet, or 5 feet by 6\r\nfeet, or 4 feet 9 inches by 5 feet. The reasons in favour of close\r\nplanting are these, that the extra number of plants to the acre is\r\nfollowed in the first two crops at least by a proportionate increase of\r\ncrop. By close planting weeds are hindered from growing, and, what is of\r\nmore consequence still, the ground is sooner covered by the growing\r\nplants, and therefore protected from the sun, exposure to which is found\r\nto impoverish more than anything else the surface soil, from which the\r\nplant chiefly seeks its nourishment. With an average good soil, and\r\ncareful handling of the trees and manuring, it is found that\r\nclosely-planted coffee may be made to continue to bear highly; that is,\r\nin proportion to the extra number of plants to the acre. Close planting\r\nis serviceable in enabling the plants to outlive the effect of exposure\r\nto high winds, which in some places are most destructive. The next\r\nproceeding is _holing_ (which, as its name implies, is to make holes in\r\npreparation for planting the coffee, at the distances staked out by the\r\nlining). As coffee is planted in a virgin soil, which cannot be cleared\r\nof roots, rocks, and logs, for the operation of the plough, and were it\r\ncleared of these the disturbance of the soil would probably cause it to\r\nbe carried away by the heavy rains; holes have to be made, and the\r\nlarger these are, the nearer the approach is to that movement of the\r\nsoil, which in general sets at liberty its fertilising properties. Holes\r\nare made from 18 inches to 2 feet every way, into which before planting\r\nthe surface soil is scraped with a hoe. It is customary to contract for\r\nthis work, which I believe is generally performed now with a sort of\r\ncrowbar having a spud blade at one end; with these the roots of trees\r\nare cut through and rocks and stones taken out, the loosened soil being\r\nremoved with the hand or with a cocoa-nut shell. This tool is furnished\r\nto the Singhalese because they prefer to sit down and work leisurely,\r\nbut where men can be employed at day-wages, and provided with mattocks\r\nto break the soil and cut out the roots and stones, and hoes to clear\r\nout the loosened earth, the same work may be far more economically\r\nperformed, inasmuch as the labourers being on their feet give not only\r\ntheir arms, but their whole body, to the exertion, and have not to raise\r\nthemselves from a sitting position between each hole they have to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS, PLANTING, &c., IN CEYLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese comprise a bungalow for the manager, lines, or huts, for the\r\nlabourers, and pulping-house and store for the preparation and reception\r\nof the crop.\r\n\r\nPlate 5 shows the main works and buildings at Messrs. Worms’ estates,\r\nPuselawa, Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe position of the pulping-house should influence the selection of the\r\nspots for the other buildings, unless other circumstances determine it.\r\nThe bungalow should, if possible, be an easy distance from the store,\r\nthat the manager may without difficulty superintend the work, which at\r\ncrop time is going on often at night as well as in the daytime. One set\r\nof lines for the labourers, for the same reason, should be near to the\r\nstore, another set may be erected more centrically with reference to the\r\nfield labour of the estate.\r\n\r\nWith reference to lines and bungalow, especially the latter, they will\r\nbe erected according to the manager’s taste, and in a great measure\r\ndepend upon the material to be obtained in the particular locality for\r\nconstructing them. True economy will be practised in making permanent\r\nand substantial dwellings which will require only slight repairs\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the land for the pulping-house and stores and\r\ndrying-ground is all important, and should only be attempted by a\r\nresident manager to whom a long residence on the plantation has afforded\r\nan intimate acquaintance with every feature of the land. The advantages\r\nwhich have to be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 5.--Main Works at Messrs. Worms’ Estates, Puselawa,\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 6.--The Pulping House, Messrs. Worms’ Estate,\r\nPuselawa.]\r\n\r\nsought and combined are, availability of water power, both to drive the\r\nmachinery and for a water-course to the pulper, on a site convenient to\r\nthe fields from which the crop is to be brought, and so level that it\r\nmay be fitted for its purposes at the least possible expense.\r\n\r\nWater power is not always used, nor is it available on every estate; but\r\nas there may be often good reasons to adopt it afterwards, it should\r\nalways be considered in the primary arrangements. It may be applied to\r\nso many economic objects--saw-mills, drying apparatus, &c.--that it\r\nshould always be applied, if possible, to everything undertaken on the\r\nestate requiring a moving power.\r\n\r\nPlate 6 is an exterior view of a pulping-house on Messrs. Worms’\r\nestates, Puselawa.\r\n\r\nCoffee when gathered from the tree fully ripe is like a rich scarlet\r\ncherry, out of which on being squeezed two coffee-berries break forth,\r\neach covered with a light skin resembling parchment, and moist, with a\r\nsweet mucilaginous fluid which rapidly decomposes. The machine called a\r\npulper is for the purpose of removing the cherry skin or husk; this it\r\ndoes by passing it between a barrel armed with perforated copper,\r\nforming a grater, and a sharp-edged board called the chop, which by\r\nmeans of wedges or screws is placed at the proper distance from the\r\nbarrel to ensure the greater part of the coffee being pressed against\r\nit, but not so close that any of the berries should be pricked through\r\ntheir parchment covering. As coffee is seldom uniform in size, much\r\npasses forward from which the husk, or pulp, as it is called, has not\r\nbeen completely removed; this, being separated by a sieve worked by the\r\nmachinery, is returned by hand to the hopper. The coffee, deprived of\r\nits husk, goes forward by a channel prepared for it into a cistern, the\r\npulps being thrown off behind; these latter are now generally saved to\r\nbe carried to the manure pit. The coffee is left to soak in the cistern\r\nfor the night, or for that length of time which is sufficient to wash\r\noff the mucilage, an operation which is facilitated by a slight\r\nfermentation--not, however, always conducted with safety to the future\r\nquality of the coffee. Pulping-houses are supplied with several\r\ncisterns, into which the several pulpings may be run off that the work\r\nmay not stand still.\r\n\r\nPlate 7 gives a view of the interior lower floor of the pulping-house on\r\nMessrs. Worms’ estates, Puselawa.\r\n\r\nIn the pulping-house above the pulpers is a large floor called the\r\ncherry loft, into which the coffee in cherry from the field is measured,\r\nand from whence, through holes, it is made to fall into the pulpers,\r\nfrom the pulpers it is carried to the cisterns, and when washed is taken\r\nout by the labourers to be dried, which brings us to speak of the store\r\nand drying apparatus. Before doing so we may mention that the pulper,\r\nwhich is considered a very imperfect machine, is generally driven by\r\nfour men at two handles, aided by a fly-wheel; the power is immediately\r\napplied to turn the barrel, to which is connected a large cog-wheel,\r\nwhich moves a pinion attached, to work a sieve or riddle.\r\n\r\nPulpers turned by water power, if properly erected to resist the strain\r\nof the connecting machinery, work with more equality of motion, and\r\ntherefore do their work better than those worked by hand.\r\n\r\nMany improvements in the pulping-machine have been suggested without\r\nsuccess; the last, which is now very generally adopted, is called a\r\ncrusher, and consists in a kind of shield instead of a chop, which\r\npresses the coffee against the barrel. This machine is said to do as\r\nmuch work in a given time as the pulper, and with less liability to cut\r\nor prick the berry.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the pulper is an imperfect machine; it is so in\r\nrespect to the incompleteness with which it performs the work for which\r\nit is constructed. The work\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 7.--Interior View of the Pulping House of Messrs.\r\nWorms’ Estates, Puselawa, Ceylon.]\r\n\r\ncomplete, would be to pass forward the whole of the cherry coffee from\r\nthe hopper, as clean parchment coffee, into the cistern, and completely\r\nseparate the pulp. Instead of this, not only is there much coffee passed\r\nforward unpulped, which has to be returned to the hopper, but much pulp\r\ncomes forward with the coffee into the cistern. To overcome these\r\nimperfections, many hands are required attending the process of pulping;\r\nseveral with sieves receive all the coffee as it comes through the\r\ntrough into the cistern, and remove all the pulp in it. The object of\r\nthis is to please the sight by making the sample even, and to take away\r\na material which both, renders the coffee difficult to dry, and, being\r\ndecomposed vegetable matter of a saccharine nature, is liable by\r\nfermentation to injure the quality of the coffee itself. The coffee\r\nwhich is passed unpulped, having been returned to the hopper as it\r\naccumulates at the end of the pulper riddle, until the picking has all\r\nbeen pulped, is sometimes passed through another pulper, set closer, and\r\nwhat then remains is dried separately in the husk. The imperfections of\r\nthe pulper have recently attracted much notice, and improvements are\r\nmaking in it.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the crowning operation of all--_Planting_. Economy\r\nshould be studied in every part of the work, and to plant to the best\r\nadvantage, nothing is more conducive than having the traces of the roads\r\nand paths through the clearings already opened if possible, so as to be\r\navailable for bringing the plants from the nurseries. Plants and stumps\r\nare both used in forming plantations; the first are seedlings, reared in\r\nnurseries until they are about 8 to 10 inches high, or just\r\ncrowned--that is, after the appearance of their first lateral branches;\r\nthe second are the stock and roots of an older tree. Under varying\r\ncircumstances there is much to be said in favour of each. If the weather\r\nis dry and the season advanced, stumps may be planted with less risk,\r\nand in less time; but if plants are to be had, and the season\r\nfavourable, it is generally considered they are the best. In putting\r\nthem into the ground, if practicable, they should be removed from the\r\nnursery with balls of earth about their roots; this is even the most\r\neconomical, as being almost an assurance against failure, and the tree\r\nthus planted receives no check, but begins to grow directly. If, on the\r\nother hand, the plants are to be brought too far to carry them with\r\nballs of earth, extreme care should be taken to place them with the tap\r\nroot perpendicularly in the soil. Invariably the effect of a tap root\r\nnot being placed perpendicularly in the hole is, that when the tree is\r\ngrown to two or three feet in height, the upper shoot and branches take\r\na paler colour to that of the healthy plant, which is of very dark\r\ngreen, the leaves also become small and elongated, and occasionally\r\nsomewhat mottled with a yellow tinge. Such plants will frequently spring\r\ninto flower and fruit prematurely, which generally turns out “boll,” or\r\nempty in husk, and as prematurely dies away. This remark is not uncalled\r\nfor, as it requires extreme vigilance to prevent the labourers\r\ncarelessly doubling up the tap as they place the plant in the earth. The\r\nhole should be well filled up and the earth trodden in round the plant,\r\nwhich should never be buried below the crown of the root.\r\n\r\nNurseries of plants are variously made; much contention has existed on\r\nthe merits of shade and no shade. Shade is not required, and the plants\r\nare best without it; yet it happens most nurseries are in some respects\r\nsubject to shade, as they have to be formed frequently before any\r\nportion of the land is opened, and should be protected by a belt of\r\nforest from the fire of the clearing; the jungle being cleared off and\r\ncarried to the sides of the ground selected. The soil is dug with hoes\r\nand picks about two spits deep, and the roots of the jungle carefully\r\ntaken up, as these would afterwards break the rootlets of the plants\r\nwhen taken up for transplanting. The ground being laid out in beds, is\r\nsometimes sown broadcast with coffee-seed, which only requires to be\r\nmost lightly covered with a little sifted mould, or the seeds are\r\npressed in, in rows, with the finger. Sometimes small seedlings, with\r\ntwo leaves and the seed leaves, are brought from another nursery, or\r\nfrom beneath the coffee-bushes of a plantation or native garden, and\r\nlined out into beds about six inches apart; these make by far the best\r\nand hardiest plants for planting out into the fields.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to notice the necessity for carefully replacing, with\r\nas little delay as possible, all failures in the planting. The longer\r\nthis is delayed the more difficult does it become to do it well; and\r\nwhen neglected, besides making the fields appear irregular and\r\nunsightly, the gaps left become weed beds, and so much of the bearing\r\nspace of the acre being lost, the crop is affected in proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen stumps are planted, a number of buds or suckers make their\r\nappearance on the root; one of these only should be left, and the others\r\ncarefully rubbed off with the finger, as often as the weeding party goes\r\nover the field.\r\n\r\nThe sprout from the bud which is left grows up and becomes the stem of a\r\ntree, and throws out its laterals somewhat higher than the tree grown\r\nfrom a nursery plant. The stump generally produces its first crop a\r\nlittle out of season; for planting up failures stumps give the least\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nNext to lining and careful planting, nothing enhances the good\r\nappearance of a plantation so much as the workmanlike formation of the\r\nroads and buildings. It is, therefore, desirable, by the use of a\r\ntheodolite, to trace the roads accurately before cutting them out.\r\nFormerly it was frequently the practice to take the road by the eye from\r\npoint to point, evading the natural difficulties of rocks or large\r\nroots, by taking the breakneck path above or below them. Roads on\r\npartial clearings should always have reference to the land which is\r\nafterwards to be felled and connected with the same set of works.\r\n\r\nPlate 8 shows a coffee district near Puselawa, Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 8.--Coffee District near Puselawa, Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII.\r\n\r\nHARVESTING THE CROP AND PREPARATION FOR MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heavy blossom appears on the tree in August and September. The\r\nprincipal crop is picked from April to July. A small crop, chiefly from\r\nyoung coffee, is picked from September to December. The produce is sent\r\ndown to Colombo, the shipping port, from April to September. If the\r\nestate be close to a carriage road this is done by carts, which can take\r\nfrom 60 to 80 bushels. The cost of transport is sometimes enormous. It\r\nis not unusual to see carts loaded with coffee lying at the bottom of a\r\nprecipice, while the bullocks which had brought them have died from\r\nexhaustion. If not near a road, carrying coolies are employed, or pack\r\nbullocks, which take a load of 3 bushels, to transport it either to a\r\nstore, from which a carriage will convey it to Colombo, or to the\r\nnavigable point of one of the rivers. Of the various modes and facility,\r\nor the want of it, possessed by estates situated in different districts,\r\nsome idea may be formed in the expense varying from 1s. to 12s. per cwt.\r\nfor bringing the produce to Colombo.\r\n\r\nThere are now in Colombo upwards of thirty establishments for the\r\npreparation of coffee for shipment, ten or twelve of these employ steam\r\npower to drive the requisite machinery. To most of them large barbecues\r\nfor drying are attached, and cooperages for the preparation of casks,\r\nand in the season, which lasts nearly three quarters of the year, from\r\n10,000 to 15,000 women and 1000 to 2000 men are employed in the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThough the coffee has been sufficiently dried on the plantation to\r\nenable it to reach Colombo in safety, it is not sufficiently hard to\r\npart with the silver pellicle which envelops each berry under the\r\nparchment skin, and to resist the pressure of the peeler, without some\r\nadditional drying in the more powerful sun at Colombo.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, again exposed on the barbecue, until it reaches a\r\ncrisp dryness. (Plate 9 shows the barbecue or drying-floor on Messrs.\r\nWorms’ estate, Puselawa, in Ceylon, and the native labourers spreading\r\nthe coffee to dry.) It is next submitted to the pressure of the peeler,\r\nwhich breaks the berry out of the parchment covering, and sets the\r\nsilver skin at liberty. It may be noticed that the silver skin, though\r\nperhaps not adding two ounces to the weight of 112 lbs., gives the\r\ncoffee an appearance considered to be unsightly in the London market,\r\nand, therefore, depreciates its value; its adherence to the coffee,\r\nthough the cause is not known in the market, is supposed to be generally\r\nthe result of bad drying on the plantation, being allowed to remain too\r\nlong wet, or being permitted to heat after it is taken from the\r\ncisterns.\r\n\r\nSeveral processes have to be gone through before the article known in\r\ncommerce as coffee is produced. In the first place, the pulpy exterior\r\nof the berry, as we have seen, has to be removed by the process of\r\npulping, which separates the seed and its thin covering, called the\r\nparchment, from the husk. When this pulping process is completed, we\r\nhave the parchment by itself in a cistern, and the next process consists\r\nin getting rid of the mucilage with which it is covered. For this\r\npurpose the water is drained from the cistern, and fermentation is\r\nallowed to take place, which it readily does after a period of\r\ntwenty-four hours, or even less on a low estate, where the climate is\r\nwarm, though forty-eight hours are generally required on the highest\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 9.--The Barbecue, or Drying-Floor, Messrs. Worms’\r\nEstates, Puselawa.]\r\n\r\nWater is then admitted into the cistern, and the coffee being agitated\r\nby wooden rakes, the mucilage combines with the water and is drained\r\noff. After this the washed parchment coffee has to be dried to a hard\r\nstage, and as it frequently happens that during crop time there is a\r\ncontinuance of wet weather for weeks and months together, the chief\r\ndifficulties which a planter has to contend with now present themselves.\r\n\r\nThe peeler, or machine for removing the parchment, consists of a\r\ncircular trough, in which a wheel is made to travel; this is generally\r\nmade of wood, and shod with copper sheeting, and is turned by central\r\npressure, like the capstan of a ship, either by hand or by the gearing\r\nof machinery attached to a steam-engine. An improvement on this has been\r\nmade by constructing the travelling wheels of iron, and the trough of\r\nplates of the same metal; these plates being serrated in one direction,\r\nso as to present a rough surface to the coffee, facilitate the fracture\r\nof the parchment. Two wheels are generally made to work in one trough,\r\neach of which is provided with a kind of scraper, to stir up the coffee\r\nin its path and cause it to present a new face to the pressure.\r\n\r\nA coffee-peeler is usually made of durable wood or iron. The\r\ncircumference of the machine is 36 feet; the breadth between the circles\r\nin the machine is 1 foot. The height of the wheel 6 feet; the thickness\r\nnear the axle-tree 1 foot, and on the top 6 inches; twelve men or four\r\nbullocks can turn it. If turned by men 200 bushels of coffee, and if\r\nworked by bullocks 140 bushels, can be obtained in nine hours; if by\r\nsteam about 800 or 1000 bushels. The cost of constructing a machine to\r\nbe worked by men or bullocks is 25_l._, by steam 600_l._\r\n\r\nAfter undergoing this process, the coffee is passed into a winnower,\r\nwhich removes nearly the whole of the parchment and silver skin. It is\r\nnow given to the women, in quantities of a bushel each, to be picked\r\nover by hand, who take out all blacks, broken berries, _triage_, or\r\nanything calculated to injure its even quality. Further to improve its\r\nappearance, the coffee is passed through a sizing machine, by which\r\ngenerally three sizes are separated: the round, or pea berry, and a\r\nlarger and smaller berry, each of which from the separation is more even\r\nin appearance, and as such preferred in the London market.\r\n\r\nSizers are variously made of perforated sheet zinc or wire gauze, with\r\nopenings of three sizes, increasing from the top in the form of a long\r\npipe, which, being slightly inclined and made to revolve, pass the\r\ncoffee, poured in above into the bins constructed to receive the\r\ndifferent sizes.\r\n\r\nThe coffee, now ready to be packed, is at once put into casks,\r\ncontaining 6 or 7 cwt. each, and sent away on board ship without delay.\r\nThese processes are constantly improving and are now thoroughly\r\nunderstood--a remark which would seem uncalled for, but for the\r\nrecollection of the bungling and conflicting systems which were in vogue\r\na few years since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR MARKET--(_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nParchment Coffee, when in an unseasoned state, is prone to enter into\r\ndecomposition from the time at which it is withdrawn from the protection\r\nof the living organism until it is thoroughly seasoned by drying, after\r\nwhich it may be kept for any length of time in a dry place.\r\n\r\nThe worth of coffee as an article of commerce is lessened in proportion\r\nto the extent to which these progressive changes are allowed to go on.\r\nIf heating has taken place, the bean can never afterwards acquire the\r\npellucid colour which is indicative of well-dried coffee, but partakes\r\nmore or less of a dingy appearance. If mouldiness ensues, the aromatic\r\nproperties, like those of tea, give place to an insipid flavour; and\r\nfinally, if the bean undergoes putrefaction, it assumes a dull black\r\ncolour, and becomes totally destitute of every valuable property.\r\n\r\nWhen the crops ripen, they must be gathered and cured under all\r\ncircumstances of weather; and as it generally happens that this has to\r\nbe done during the prevalence of the periodical rains, the difficulties\r\nto be contended with are so much the greater. The extensive nature of\r\nthe operations has also to be taken into account in forming an estimate\r\nof the difficulties to be provided for. During the busy season of crop\r\nupwards of 1000 bushels of cherries are daily gathered from some\r\nplantations, yielding an increase of 500 bushels of parchment coffee to\r\nbe daily added to that which has already accumulated in the store.\r\n\r\nPast experience having shown that coffee was most easily preserved in a\r\nsweet state when spread thinly on the floor, large and commodious\r\nbuildings were called into use, notwithstanding the unusually heavy\r\nexpense which attended their erection in situations remote from town,\r\nwhere sufficiently skilful labour was only to be had at the time, and\r\nwith great difficulty. On this account inadequate accommodation was\r\nprovided on many plantations, and the coffee accumulating to a\r\nconsiderable depth, no amount of hand-turning could keep it from\r\ncontracting a musty smell, its proneness to decomposition increasing\r\ngreatly in proportion to the extent of the accumulation.\r\n\r\nSome years ago it occurred to Mr. Clerihew that it was possible, by\r\nmeans of fanners, working on the exhausting principle, so to withdraw\r\nair from an enclosed space as to establish a current of air through\r\nmasses of coffee spread on perforated floors forming the top and bottom\r\nof that space. This plan he carried into execution at Rathoongodde\r\nplantation, and it has since been adopted by many planters.\r\n\r\nThe following is a detailed description of Mr. Clerihew’s invention, a\r\nmodel of which was shown at the International Exhibition of 1851:\r\n\r\nThe water-wheel is an overshot one, nine feet in diameter, and is of\r\nmuch smaller dimensions than any wheel that has hitherto been employed\r\nfor pulping. It is, however, sufficient in power to work the fans and\r\npulpers simultaneously, the excess of its power over that of other\r\nwheels being gained by the diminution of friction consequent on there\r\nbeing no intervening shafting and gearing. The entire wheel is\r\nconstructed of wood, with the exception of the shaft, which is unusually\r\nlight, as it has merely to serve as a support to the wheel. By means of\r\na double band rim-bolted to the arms on each side, motion is given to\r\nthe pulpers from the one and to the fans from the other.\r\n\r\nThe floors of the curing-house are laid with laths 1¼ inch square and 2\r\ninches apart; these are covered with open coir matting; being rather\r\ncheap and durable, this material answers the purpose remarkably well.\r\nThe side walls of the curing-house are constructed in the manner of the\r\ncountry, viz. of wattled work filled in with clay and smoothed over so\r\nas to be air-tight.\r\n\r\nTo derive the full benefit of natural heat, the roof is covered with\r\nfelt or with sheet-iron, so that in fine weather the temperature of the\r\nair in the upper floor is raised considerably by contact with the hot\r\nroof, and its capacity for absorbing moisture much increased,\r\npreparatory to its being drawn down through the mass of coffee in the\r\nupper floor. Even in the cool climate of the district of Upper\r\nHewahette, at an elevation of 4500 feet, in a fine day the temperature\r\nof the air under a felt roof is 120° when the fans are not working, so\r\nthat a great drying power is thus made available at no expense.\r\n\r\nThe lower floor, on the other hand, is adapted for the application of\r\nartificial heat for the purpose of evaporating the surface water from\r\neach separate batch of coffee as it is taken from the washing cisterns\r\npreparatory to its being deposited in the upper floor. In wet weather\r\nthis is essential, for the atmospheric air being then saturated with\r\nmoisture, no drying can take place until its capacity for absorbing\r\nmoisture is increased by an increase of temperature. One other reason\r\nfor adopting this arrangement is, that when the coffee is first taken\r\nwet from the washing cisterns the interstices of the beans are more or\r\nless occupied with water, and thus present a medium less pervious to air\r\nthan is the case when the surface water has been dried off. Consequently\r\nit is desirable that, until this has been done, the depth of the coffee\r\nshould not exceed six inches, and, to be equal to every emergency, the\r\nheating power ought to be sufficient in the wettest weather to evaporate\r\nthe surface water from the produce of a day’s picking (within\r\ntwenty-four hours), so as to allow of its being removed into the upper\r\nfloor. The daily number of bushels picked from any, or the same\r\nplantation, is of course a variable quantity: depending on the extent of\r\nthe cultivation, the quality of the trees, the number of hands employed,\r\nand the elevation of the land; the latter, when considerable, having the\r\neffect of prolonging the picking season. The stove is more than\r\nsufficient for a daily picking of 400 bushels of cherries.\r\n\r\nThe heating stove is square, has a waggon head with a semicircular\r\nopening in the centre for the passage of air, and is constructed of\r\nstout sheet-iron. It is placed within an arch, with a clearance of nine\r\ninches all round also for the passage of air, the guiding principle in\r\nits construction being to adapt it to the burning of wood, and to expose\r\nas much heating surface as possible to the air which flows past it into\r\nthe air-chamber beneath the ground-floor. The stove opening is the only\r\none which admits air to the coffee on the ground-floor. Consequently,\r\nwhen it is more or less closed by a damper, the power of the fans is\r\nexerted either in part or altogether on the mass of coffee in the upper\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nIn these applications of natural and artificial heat to the curing of\r\ncoffee, the heat is conveyed by the air through the whole depth of\r\ncoffee in such a manner that each bean feels its influence, whilst the\r\nwatery products elicited by the heat are at the same time, and by the\r\nsame means, carried off. It cannot be doubted that these applications\r\nare far more effectual than any of the modes hitherto in use; in some\r\ncases stoves were employed in the apartment containing the coffee, but\r\nit is obvious that their influence could not extend beyond the surface\r\nof the mass, and that, if the apartment was closed, there was no\r\nprovision for carrying off the air that had become loaded with moisture\r\ndue to its temperature; whilst, if the apartment was open, so as to\r\nafford a free draught of air, the greater portion of the heat given out\r\nby the stove was carried out before the heated air could act on the\r\ncoffee. In other cases, heating pipes of various kinds were used below\r\nthe floors on which the coffee was placed. This arrangement, however,\r\nhas the effect of injuring the coffee, by steaming it; no provision\r\nbeing made for carrying off the excess of hot watery vapour which\r\naccumulates within the mass, but, on the other hand, the natural\r\nprocesses of decomposition are assisted and promoted.\r\n\r\nThe construction of Mr. Clerihew’s heating apparatus is simple, and a\r\nmoderate supply of fuel has a considerable effect in raising the\r\ntemperature of cold damp air before it is brought into contact with the\r\ncoffee through which it is drawn by the aid of the fans. This heated air\r\nbecomes diffused throughout the whole of the chamber, which extends\r\nbeneath the ground-floor in such a manner that no portion of the coffee\r\nwhich is on that floor can be free from its influence.\r\n\r\nThe fans at Rathoongodde are much more powerful than those in common\r\nuse, the peculiarity in the shape of the blade giving them a great\r\nadvantage as air-moving machines, in so far as the indraught is\r\nconcerned, whilst one-half of the periphery being open a ready exit is\r\nafforded for the discharge of air. In the ordinary fan, if a smoking\r\nmatch is applied to any part of the indraught opening, the air will be\r\nseen to flow towards a neutral point in the centre of the fan, following\r\na spiral direction, and thence in the periphery of the fan.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Clerihew’s modification of the blade each film of air, so to\r\nspeak, flows into the fan directly, until it impinges on the curvilinear\r\npart of the blade, and from that point is thrown at a right angle\r\ntowards the periphery. The column of air being thus less distorted in\r\nits progress, there is not only a greater quantity discharged, but much\r\nless power is consumed in effecting that discharge--in the common fan\r\nit is evident, from the circumstance of the air flowing to an apex,\r\nthat a great amount of power is wasted in producing the increased\r\nvelocity with which a column of air equal in volume to the two ingress\r\nopenings of the fan must pass so contracted an area before it is\r\ndischarged; hence it is that the fan, as an air-moving machine, has been\r\nconsidered unequal to the screw.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed space of the coffee-curing house at Rathoongodde has an\r\narea in the cross section of 100 superficial feet, it is 70 feet long,\r\nand a pair of fans are placed at one end. Repeated experiments have\r\nshown that, when the fans make 100 revolutions per minute, a cloud of\r\nsmoke travels to them from the centre of the enclosed space (a distance\r\nof 35 feet) in precisely 15 seconds, hence we have 100 × 35 = 3500 cubic\r\nfeet of air discharged in a quarter of a minute, or 14,000 cubic feet\r\nper minute; a screw of nearly seven feet in diameter would be required\r\nto discharge the same amount of air, and the cost of it in England is 84\r\nguineas, whilst the pair of fans made and fitted up at Rathoongodde cost\r\nunder 9_l._\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the enclosed space, with a depth of four feet of coffee\r\nin the upper floor, the flame of a candle is blown to a right angle when\r\nthe whole power of the fans is put on that floor; near to the fans it is\r\nextinguished, the air moving forward with a uniformly accelerated\r\nvelocity from the farther end towards the fans, owing to the constant\r\naccessions made by the air entering the enclosed space throughout its\r\nwhole length.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the only entrance of air into the\r\nair-chamber beneath the ground-floor is by the opening in which the\r\nstove is placed, consequently, when this opening is closed by a damper,\r\nit is obvious that the whole power of the fans is exerted on the mass of\r\ncoffee which is being cured on the upper floor, and that the division\r\nof this power may be regulated at will by more or less obstructing the\r\nentrance of air to the air-chamber by the damper. The upper floor is not\r\nsupposed to be an air-tight apartment, but as the chief entrance of air\r\nis by the two doors in the end, its influx may be so far obstructed by\r\nclosing them as to throw the greater part of the power of the fans on\r\nthe coffee which is on the ground-floor, when this is required. Again,\r\nsince it is obvious that, in wet weather, when the atmosphere is fully\r\nsaturated with moisture proportionate to its temperature, it becomes a\r\ndesideratum to introduce a portion of the artificially heated air into\r\nthe vacant space which is over the coffee in the upper floor, so that\r\nthe air which passes down through that coffee may have an absorbing\r\ntendency; this is accomplished by shutting the doors of the upper floor\r\nand throwing open the top-covering of the fan. By this means one-half of\r\nthe air which is drawn from the stove is thrown in above the coffee in\r\nthe upper floor, whilst the other half is discharged altogether. This\r\ninfusion of heated air would on many occasions be attended with benefit,\r\nbut the advantage will naturally depend on the comparative state of\r\ndryness of the coffee on the two floors.\r\n\r\nIn having recourse to these practical modifications some little judgment\r\nand observation are of more service than precept. It will be found, for\r\ninstance, that if the coffee in the upper floor approaches the dry\r\nstage, it is better in wet weather to shut the doors of that floor as\r\nwell as the tops of the fans, so that only a small flittering of air\r\nsufficient to ward off the first stages of decomposition may pass\r\nthrough that coffee, whilst the wet coffee below has the full benefit of\r\na more rapid circulation of absorbent air.\r\n\r\nAttention may now be directed to the practical results which these\r\narrangements have afforded in the curing of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe coffee in the upper floor, as the crop advanced, gradually\r\nincreased in depth until it stood at four feet all over the floor. When\r\nat this depth, with the fans making 100 revolutions per minute, the flow\r\nof air was quite sensible to the hand placed on the surface of the\r\ncoffee, and was rendered apparent by the smoke from a match following\r\nthe direction of the air; at the same time the rarefaction of the air\r\nwithin the enclosed space was so very slight as barely to be appreciable\r\nby a very delicate mountain barometer, though it had the effect of\r\ncausing the door to shut with a slam; thus showing that a slight\r\nrarefaction of the air is sufficient to disturb the balance of\r\natmospheric pressure, even when acting through a medium of coffee of\r\nconsiderable depth. The current of air thus established continued to\r\nflow without interruption until the fans were stopped.\r\n\r\nA cold glass tumbler taken into the store in a warm day, when the fans\r\nwere not in motion, became instantly dimmed and wet by the precipitation\r\nof moisture from the internal air. When another glass was taken into the\r\nstore, one minute after the fans were put in motion, it remained clear,\r\nwithout a trace of moisture.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory result soon showed itself, viz. that whilst the\r\ntemperature of the air as it entered the moist coffee was 80° in a warm\r\nday, the temperature of the coffee itself, as indicated by an immersed\r\nthermometer, was only 58°; the wet coffee being invariably coldest when\r\nthe air that was made to pass through it was warmest. This paradox\r\nadmitted of easy explanation, when it was considered that each bean of\r\nundried coffee was under similar circumstances to evaporating vessels of\r\nwater placed in a draught of warm air for the purpose of cooling the\r\nwater. The cold thus produced was, therefore, the necessary concomitant\r\nof the evaporation that was going on, and the difference between these\r\ntemperatures afforded a measure of the drying power in different states\r\nof the weather. The circumstance of the hot air lowering the\r\ntemperature of the coffee was also favourable in another point of view,\r\nseeing that it has been shown that heat is one of the conditions which\r\npromotes mouldiness, or the germination of fungi.\r\n\r\nEvery bushel of parchment coffee contains half a cubic foot of air, a\r\nfact ascertained by a bushel which took thirty-three measures of water\r\nto fill it. When full of newly-washed coffee it took thirteen of these\r\nmeasures of the water to displace the air from the interstices of the\r\nbeans without overflowing, so that we have 13--33 of air in a bushel of\r\ncoffee; in other words, half a cubic foot. Hence, the fans in use are\r\ncapable of giving a fresh atmosphere to 28,000 bushels of coffee every\r\nminute, or in the same time four fresh atmospheres to 7000 bushels.\r\n\r\nDuring a continuance of nearly three months of wet weather which\r\noccurred at one crop time, the coffee in the curing-house dried very\r\nslowly, but was kept in a perfectly fresh and sweet state without the\r\nintervention of any manual labour, further than in depositing each day’s\r\nincrease in the lower floor to dry off the surface water, and removing\r\nthat of each previous day to the upper floor, where it was spread on the\r\ntop of all the coffee that had previously accumulated. These three\r\nmonths of wet weather were succeeded by a fortnight of very dry weather,\r\nand, on examining the coffee at the end of that period, it was found to\r\nhave reached the dry horny stage at which it is usual to despatch it\r\nfrom the estate to Colombo, for the purpose of being peeled and shipped.\r\nOn examining the beans they were found to be of that clear colour which\r\ndistinguishes coffee carefully cured in small quantities, with the\r\nadvantage of the most favourable weather. Under like circumstances, viz.\r\nduring such a continuation of wet weather, it would have been impossible\r\nto preserve the coffee free from more or less mustiness of smell, by\r\nmanual labour employed in the usual way, whilst at the same time the\r\nexpense of storework would have been more than fourfold. The whole\r\nexpense of the storework, viz. pulping, washing, curing, and storing the\r\nRathoongodde coffee, amounted to 2¼d. per cwt., and when it is\r\nconsidered that during crop time the value of every man’s labour is\r\ngreatly increased, it is an object, as far as possible, to substitute\r\nmechanical contrivance for manual labour, so that all hands may be\r\nemployed in gathering the crop as it ripens.\r\n\r\nEvery planter knows that when coffee is spread out in a single layer on\r\nthe floor of his store, it becomes dry after a time, and is well cured\r\nwithout any further attention on his part; but it is impossible to\r\ndevote sufficient space for this purpose without incurring an expense\r\nwhich would be quite incompatible with his circumstances. When, however,\r\ncoffee is thus spread out in a single layer, it is obvious that the\r\nreason why it requires no attention is, because the beans being freely\r\nexposed to the atmosphere, there is naturally a constant change of the\r\nair by which they are surrounded; the same air is not sufficiently long\r\nin contact with the beans to excite the first action of decomposition,\r\nand the absorption of oxygen is not accomplished. Presuming, however,\r\nthat it were so, the subsequent actions could not take place, for the\r\nproducts of the first action, viz. carbonic acid, heat and watery\r\nvapour, would immediately make their escape and be dissipated by the\r\natmosphere, which is precisely what takes place when, by mechanical\r\nmeans, a draught of air is carried through a _mass_ of coffee. Hence, it\r\nis evident that the requirements of space are overcome by the adoption\r\nof this plan, and that a great mass of coffee is placed under conditions\r\nsimilar to those by which a single layer is influenced when exposed to a\r\nnatural draught of atmospheric air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION IN SOUTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern India is becoming as celebrated for its coffee, as Northern\r\nIndia for its tea. We find that the exports of coffee from Madras have\r\nincreased considerably during the last five years, and there is every\r\nreason for supposing that Southern India will shortly become the chief\r\ncoffee-producing country of the world. We have no idea of the number of\r\nacres of land under coffee cultivation in the Madras Presidency, but it\r\nmust be very large, for after its local wants have been supplied, coffee\r\nto the value of half a million sterling is exported.\r\n\r\nIn 1858-59 the shipments were 7,288,421 lbs. to foreign ports, and\r\n4,083,917 lbs. to Indian ports. In 1862-63 the shipments were 16,292,238\r\nlbs. to foreign ports, and 3,976,766 lbs. to Indian ports.\r\n\r\nThough some parts of India are well adapted to the culture, it is not\r\nyet so extensively cultivated as might have been expected from the\r\nvicinity of its Arabian sites to the Malabar coast. There, however, some\r\nexcellent coffee is grown, as well as in the hilly regions of Mysore and\r\non the slopes of the Neilgherries, and some of these are of such good\r\nquality, and so carefully prepared, as to bring the same price as Mocha\r\ncoffee. Some very good specimens of coffee have also been produced in\r\nthe interior of India, as in the district of Chota Nagpore, where the\r\nculture might apparently be greatly extended, and be of great benefit\r\nfor consumption in that part of the country.\r\n\r\nAccording to local tradition, the coffee-plant was introduced into\r\nMysore by a Mussulman pilgrim, named Baba Booden, who came from Arabia\r\nabout two hundred years ago, and took up his abode as a hermit in the\r\nuninhabited hills in the Nuggur Division named after him, and where he\r\nestablished a college, which still exists, endowed by government. It is\r\nsaid that he brought some coffee-berries from Mocha, which he planted\r\nnear to his hermitage, about which there are now to be seen some very\r\nold coffee-trees. However this may be, there is no doubt that the\r\ncoffee-plant has been known in that neighbourhood from time immemorial,\r\nbut the berry has never come into general use among the people for a\r\nbeverage. It is only of late years that the coffee trade of these\r\ndistricts has become of any magnitude, or that planting has been carried\r\nto any important extent. The export of coffee from British India, which\r\nin 1851 was only 3239 tons, had increased in 1861 to 8535 tons; about\r\none-fourth of this is shipped from Bombay, and nearly all the remainder\r\nfrom Madras.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years ago a few Europeans were engaged in coffee\r\nplanting near Chickmoogloor, a few miles from the Bababooden Hills.\r\nAbout twenty years ago the plantation producing the well-known coffee\r\ncalled “Cannon’s Mysore,” and others, on the Memzera, or “Bad Mountain,”\r\nwas commenced by two enterprising gentlemen. The success of these has\r\ninduced many more Europeans to plant coffee there, and the consequence\r\nis that the coffee trade of Mysore bids fair to emulate that of Ceylon.\r\nIt has given, also, an example to other parts of India, and the plant\r\noriginally taken from the Bababooden Muth is now extending over tens of\r\nthousands of acres in Coorg, the Wynaad district, the Neilgherry Hills,\r\nand along the Western Ghauts, north and south.\r\n\r\nIn Mysore the number of European coffee-planters has increased to about\r\nthirty, while the number of native planters is estimated at between\r\nthree and four thousand.\r\n\r\nThe average produce per acre in Mysore is probably not half that of\r\nCeylon. Some attempts have been made to cultivate coffee in the open\r\ncountry, but without success; it seems to require forest land and\r\nconsiderable elevation and moisture. “Cannon’s Mysore” is grown on a\r\nrange of hills from 3500 to 4000 feet above the sea, having the benefit\r\nof the south-west monsoon, which very seldom fails at all, never\r\nentirely, and of the tail-end of the north-east monsoon. This elevation\r\ngives a pleasant climate, well suited to Europeans.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of the genus Coffea (_C. alpestris_, _C. grumeloides_,\r\nand _C. Wightiana_) are indigenous to the Neilgherry Hills.\r\n\r\nA berry, generally one which has itself fallen ripe from the tree, is\r\nput into the ground, usually in a nursery plot, though some planters\r\nprefer to place the seed in the identical hole which is to be its future\r\nsituation. The nursery plan is, however, generally adopted, and here the\r\nyoung plant, which shoots up in about a month after it is sown, is\r\nallowed to remain until about sixteen months old. It, or rather we will\r\nsay they, for hundreds and thousands are generally dealt with at once,\r\nare transplanted to holes which have been carefully prepared for them on\r\nthe soil which is to be their future location. These holes are generally\r\ntwo feet cube, and many good planters prefer them even deeper; in this\r\nthe plant is carefully placed and covered around, and in eighteen months\r\nfrom that time, _i.e._ about three years from the time the berry was\r\nfirst planted, our small coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, the first\r\ncrop being of course very scanty.\r\n\r\nThe berry is picked from November to the end of February, by any number\r\nof men, women, and boys which can be collected, and who are paid by the\r\nquantity they pick, some expert hands earning a good deal.\r\n\r\nThe berry collected is carried to the house of the estate, and there\r\nhaving been weighed, is thrown into what is called a cherry loft, a\r\nwooden chamber, alongside of, but a little higher, than the place\r\ncontaining the pulper. From this cherry loft to the pulper the coffee is\r\nwashed by a stream of water, which carries it along a trough so arranged\r\nas to catch and impede any stones or heavier materials from entering the\r\npulping machine. These heavier materials sink to the bottom of the\r\ntrough, and the buoyant coffee-berry, floating on the surface, is borne\r\nto its destination.\r\n\r\nThe object of the pulper is to remove the fleshy capsule from the berry,\r\nand this being accomplished, the coffee passes on in one direction,\r\nwhilst the pulp, by a clever arrangement of the mechanism of the\r\ninstrument, is pushed away in another. The berry is now thrown into a\r\nvat and allowed to ferment, until the remaining mucilaginous substance\r\nadherent to the parchment covering is easily washed away by water.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, it is thrown on open exposed places, called\r\nbarbecues, and allowed to dry in the sun. This takes about twelve days,\r\nwhen it is packed in gunny (jute) bags, placed upon bullocks, and\r\ndespatched to the coast.\r\n\r\nThere it is what is called garbled, that is, having been once more\r\nexposed to the sun and thoroughly dried, it is placed in circular\r\ntroughs, and over it large heavy wheels, shod with iron nails, are made\r\nto revolve. This removes what is called the parchment skin, leaving the\r\nberry now covered only with a beautifully fine coating, the silver skin.\r\n\r\nIt is then, by a number of women employed for the purpose, carefully\r\nsized; after this, passed through a pea-berry mill, the object being to\r\nseparate the round pea-shaped berry from the flatter, the former being\r\nmuch more prized, and fetching a higher price in the market, though why,\r\nit is difficult to say, as it makes no better coffee than the other; and\r\nas it has to be deprived of its form by roasting and grinding before it\r\ncomes to table, the advantage of its pea-shaped figure is, to say the\r\nleast of it, somewhat obscure.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise separated from the rest what is called “triage,” the\r\nbroken and otherwise defective beans, which are also packed by\r\nthemselves, and which again, we believe, though selling more cheaply,\r\nare found to make quite as good an infusion for a beverage as their more\r\naristocratic friends the pea-berries. However, pea-berries, flats, and\r\ntriage, are all ultimately packed in square wooden boxes and shipped to\r\nEngland, where it is sold, roasted, ground, and drank.\r\n\r\nIn Wynaad, in the close of 1863, there were 93 coffee estates, covering\r\n50,000 acres, of which about 15,000 acres were planted; 6100 acres had\r\ntrees over two years old on them. There were also about 3600 acres under\r\nculture with coffee by the natives. Wynaad is an elevated plateau,\r\nrising somewhat abruptly from the western or Malabar side, but sloping\r\nmore towards the Mysore or easterly side.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of coffee exported from Tellicherry during the official\r\nyear ending April, 1862, was 58,500 cwt., of which about 30,000 cwt. is\r\nsupposed to have come from Wynaad, the rest from Coorg. 8 cwt. of coffee\r\nper acre is considered an average yield in Wynaad, 10 cwt. a good crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nBOURBON, JAVA, AND THE EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was from Beit-el-Faguil, the European factory near Mocha, that the\r\ncoffee-tree was transported to the island of Bourbon, in the year 1718,\r\nand it is remarkable that the islanders recognised the plant as natural\r\nto their own country, and brought the astonished importers abundance\r\nfrom their native mountains. In Bourbon they distinguish four varieties\r\nof the coffee-plant.\r\n\r\n1. The Mocha, which is very delicate, for the plants degenerate and\r\noften perish after a good crop.\r\n\r\n2. The Levoy, which is more hardy, but the coffee is inferior in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n3. The Myrtle, a variety of the Mocha, very hardy, and yielding abundant\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n4. The Marron, or wild coffee, with such bitter and narcotic properties\r\nthat it can only be used by admixture with the berries of one of the\r\nother varieties.\r\n\r\nJAVA.--In Java, coffee is a government monopoly, and the planters bring\r\ntheir coffee to a central government depôt for sale at a fixed price.\r\nThe island exports about 1,250,000 cwts. of coffee annually. Java coffee\r\nhas lost much of its former repute from being largely saturated with\r\nmoisture, artificially to the extent of 14 per cent.; this increases the\r\nweight, but must injure the quality in transport.\r\n\r\nAt the Paris Exhibition of 1855, the Netherlands Commercial Association\r\ncontributed a very varied collection of two dozen varieties of coffees\r\nfrom the Dutch government possessions in Java, under the following\r\nclassification: Brown, clear brown, deep yellow, yellow, yellowish,\r\nwhite, whitish, pale of Havana kind, blue, fine green, handsome green,\r\ngreen, greenish, mottled green, deep green West India kind, green West\r\nIndia kind, pale green West India kind, dark Demerara kind, green\r\nDemerara kind, deep grey, triage, common black, greenish Menado, and\r\nwhite Padang. The Netherlands Society sell about 1,000,000 bags or bales\r\nof coffee annually.\r\n\r\nThe following were the exports of coffee from Java in 1862:\r\n\r\n                                      piculs.\r\n  To Holland on private account       128,047\r\n  To other countries                  165,116\r\n  By the Netherlands Trading Company  877,241\r\n                                    ---------\r\n                                    1,170,404\r\n\r\nThe position of the coffee trade of Java is shown in the figures\r\nannexed, for five years:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPORT AND VALUE OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\n         tons.     value.\r\n  1858   66,575  £2,614,505\r\n  1859   59,769   2,565,137\r\n  1860   54,638   2,486,115\r\n  1861   61,783   2,850,518\r\n  1862   63,286   3,465,747\r\n\r\nThree kinds of Java coffee are commonly brought to Europe--Jacatra\r\n(usually sold as Java), Cheribou, and Samarang. The first is the best,\r\nthe second is generally a little lighter colour and of somewhat inferior\r\nquality, and the third has yellowish brown, or green, flattened beans.\r\nWhat is generally sold in the Dutch markets as Samarang is, however,\r\nsimply a kind of “triage,” with black beans of a coarse flavour.\r\n\r\nSIAM.--On the hilly districts of the east coast of the Gulf of Siam the\r\ncultivation of coffee is carried on to a limited extent, and some very\r\nfine samples of Siam coffee were shown at the International Exhibition\r\nof 1862, sent me by Messrs. Markwold and Co., and by Sir Robert\r\nSchomburgk, the British Consul-General.\r\n\r\nSUMATRA is one of the worst kinds of coffee received from the Eastern\r\nArchipelago. The beans are large, dark yellow or brown, and occasionally\r\neven black, and the flavour varies considerably. The production in\r\nSumatra averages about 5 to 6,000,000 lbs., but has often been double\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\nCELEBES.--With the exception of Menado, which has large beans of a pale\r\ngreenish or yellow colour, Celebes coffee is greatly inferior to Java,\r\nand it is questionable whether the colour when brought to market is not\r\ngiven by artificial means. The production is about 1,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINES.--Manilla coffee is one of the best of the Eastern kinds,\r\nand quite equal to Java. The average production is about 3,000,000 lbs.\r\nThe beans are medium-sized, and of a pale greenish colour. The coffee is\r\nshipped in bags of about 150 lbs., or in cases or chests of 200 lbs. to\r\n300 lbs.\r\n\r\nOTHER SOURCES.--The cultivation of coffee is making rapid progress in\r\nthe Sandwich Islands. There are now considerably more than half a\r\nmillion trees in bearing on the island, producing upwards of 2,000,000\r\nlbs. annually--the largest proportion of which is shipped to California.\r\nQueensland and the northern districts of Australia could raise large\r\nquantities of coffee. It is much less laborious than cotton, more fitted\r\nfor women and children, and, being adapted to the mountain ranges of\r\ntropical climates, of course more healthy and invigorating than the\r\nsultry plains. The range of mountains varying from twenty-five to thirty\r\nmiles from the northern coast of Australia, towards Torres Straits,\r\nwould be admirably suited to the culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE AS A BEVERAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, much as coffee is used in this country, the\r\nproper mode of preparing it as a beverage should be so little\r\nunderstood. Perhaps it is that most people consider coffee-making as too\r\neasy a process to need any pains at all; and for this reason the coffee\r\nserved at nine breakfast-tables out of ten, throughout the kingdom, is a\r\nmiserable muddy infusion, which people seem to drink only because, as\r\nwasherwomen say, it is “wet and warm.” The right way of making coffee is\r\nnot less easy than the wrong one; there is no mystery about it. All that\r\nis required is the observance of a few simple rules:\r\n\r\n1. The nature of coffee is such that it parts very easily with its\r\naromatic, stimulating, and other properties; a small quantity of water\r\nwill draw out all the goodness quite as effectually as a large quantity,\r\nand it will do this if the coffee-berries be only bruised or very\r\ncoarsely ground. It is a grave mistake to suppose that coffee should be\r\nground to a fine powder; extreme fineness is the great cause of “thick\r\ncoffee” as prepared for breakfast. In Eastern countries, where people\r\nknow what good coffee means, they always bruise the berries in a mortar.\r\nIn fact, the goodness of coffee depends more on the roasting and the\r\nmethod of preparing afterwards, than on the quality of the berry, or any\r\nother particular.\r\n\r\n2. Buy your coffee ready roasted, but not ground; that is, buy\r\ncoffee-berries, and always choose such as are fresh roasted, in\r\npreference to stale. Observe, also, whether your grocer keeps the\r\narticle properly shut up in tin canisters, or lets it lie about in open\r\ntubs or trays.\r\n\r\n3. If possible, buy a coffee-mill, one that will grind very coarsely.\r\nThe price varies from 2s. 6d. to 5s. This article is so essential to a\r\ngood cup of coffee, that no one who can afford the outlay should\r\nhesitate to buy one. Those who have a pestle and mortar may try the\r\nmethod of bruising; but whether a mill or a mortar, no more should be\r\nground or crushed than is wanted for use at the time.\r\n\r\n4. Coffee requires to be kept in a very dry place; and, as it readily\r\ntakes up the flavour of other articles near which it may be placed, it\r\nshould be kept in an air-tight vessel. If you buy tea and coffee at the\r\nsame time, do not pack them in one parcel or basket, or carry them in\r\nthe same packet, for the true flavour of both will be injured. We\r\npresume that no one will be so careless as to keep either tea or coffee\r\nin paper only; a wooden box would be better than this, but a bottle or\r\nporcelain jar is best of all.\r\n\r\n5. Have a clean, dry coffee-pot; it should always be rinsed out when put\r\naway, and turned down to drain.\r\n\r\n6. To every half pint of water, allow half an ounce of coffee-powder;\r\nhave your kettle of water boiling, put the necessary quantity of powder\r\ninto the coffee-pot, and pour in as much water from the kettle as you\r\nrequire. Set the pot on the fire for a few seconds, but on no account\r\nlet the contents boil up; then pour about half a pint of the liquor into\r\na cup, and pour it back again into the pot, and stand it on the hob or\r\non the fender to settle. If these directions have been properly\r\nfollowed, there will be in three or four minutes a pot of coffee as\r\nclear and well-tasted as any one could wish to drink. Should it be too\r\nstrong, you have only to use less of the coffee-powder. All the goodness\r\nis extracted with the first boiling; and those who wish to drink good\r\ncoffee must never boil the same grounds a second time.\r\n\r\n7. The milk in all cases must be warmed, and used as hot as possible;\r\nand it should always be put into the cup with the sugar before the\r\ncoffee is poured in. When a cup of coffee is taken after dinner, it\r\nshould be drank without milk, and with little or no sugar.\r\n\r\n8. But of all the preparations of coffee there is none equal to the\r\nFrench, known as _café au lait_, or milk coffee. We have drank it\r\nconstantly for several years, and can pronounce it to excel all others\r\nas a breakfast beverage. In this there is more milk than water, and the\r\ncoffee liquor is rather an essence than a decoction; it will be almost\r\nblack in colour. The process to be followed is the same in most respects\r\nas described; but, instead of a quart or three pints, not more than a\r\nthird of your usual quantity of water is to be poured on the full\r\nquantity of coffee-powder. After it has stood to settle, pour it\r\ncarefully off the grounds into a jug or pitcher, which is to be kept hot\r\nby any convenient means. In this way the liquor, though black, will be\r\nperfectly clear. At the same time a quantity of milk, according to the\r\nwants of your party, must be heated in a saucepan with a spout or a lip.\r\nWhen this is ready, pour it into your breakfast-cups until they are\r\nthree-parts full, or rather more, add the sugar, and then fill up with\r\ncoffee from the jug, more or less, according as you prefer it strong or\r\nweak. Coffee made in this way will be found more nutritious, and to\r\npossess greater richness and smoothness, than can be attained by any\r\nother means.\r\n\r\nMany persons are in the habit of keeping roasted coffee in vessels of\r\ntin, closely secured; this is a most improper mode, and the consequences\r\nof doing so may be pointed out. It is known that coffee contains gallic\r\nacid, a principle which has the property of acting on iron or tin, and\r\nit is therefore certain that in keeping coffee in these canisters the\r\nacid has such an effect in dissolving particles of the metal, as not\r\nonly to affect the taste, but even the colour of the coffee. To convince\r\none’s self of this, it is only necessary to leave some freshly-roasted\r\ncoffee in a tinned vessel for a time, and it will soon be found to have\r\nimbibed a black colour and a most disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, to be necessary to avoid keeping coffee in these\r\nmetal receptacles. The best mode of properly preserving the article is\r\nby using vessels of porcelain, or other similar material. With regard to\r\nthe description of coffee-pot to be used in preparing the article, it\r\nshould never be of tin or iron; nothing will so soon and so surely\r\ndestroy the fine flavour of the beverage as these descriptions of\r\ncoffee-pots. It has generally been the practice to make coffee either by\r\nboiling it, or by pouring boiling water on the ground coffee placed on a\r\nfilter. Both of these methods are bad.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that boiling water destroys or sensibly alters the\r\nvolatile parts of the berry, and dissolves those which are bitter and\r\nunpleasant. We ought not, therefore, to employ water heated to a greater\r\ntemperature than to allow the finger being placed in it. But difficult\r\nas it may be to believe, there can be no doubt but that the best mode of\r\npreparing this beverage is with cold water. Coffee so made is not only\r\nmore aromatic, more limpid, and more substantial, but it is far stronger\r\nthan any made with hot water. The cold infusion takes from the coffee\r\nand communicates to the water all its aromatic qualities, while it does\r\nnot imbibe much, if any, of the gallic acid; consequently this\r\npreparation is far less bitter than that which has been boiled, in which\r\nprocess the most minute particles are acted upon.\r\n\r\nCoffee thus made is of a fine bright and dark colour; it requires far\r\nless sugar and much less care, because all that has to be done is to\r\nplace the powder on the filter, drop on it a little water, and when well\r\nmoistened to pour on it the proper quantity of water. The filtration\r\nwill be completed in a moderately short space of time, and the liquor\r\nhaving run through, may be again poured on the coffee, so as to remove\r\nany further portion of flavour left in it; and when this has been done,\r\nthe preparation will be so delicate and aromatic that those who taste it\r\nwill adopt the mode in preference to any other. When the coffee thus\r\nmade is to be warmed for use, it must not be heated to the boiling\r\npoint, and take care that the vessel in which it is warmed be quite\r\nfull. It may be here remarked that coffee thus made warm is always more\r\npleasant than when drank at the time of its preparation, provided it be\r\nnot made to boil, and that the coffee-pot be well closed. It is equally\r\nnecessary with the above that the berry should be well and thoroughly\r\nroasted, and not ground in a mill or machine, but pounded and sifted, so\r\nas to secure the particles being of equal fineness.\r\n\r\nTo enter into an examination of the comparative merits and demerits of\r\nthe several percolators and cafetières at present in use, would extend\r\nthese observations to too great a length; but most of those generally\r\nadopted are worthless, or complicated, with the abominable bag-filter,\r\nwhich is seldom kept clean. There is ample room for inventors in the\r\nmanufacture of a simple coffee-pot with a water-gauge at the side, which\r\nshall effect what is not now done--a passage of the hot water once only\r\nthrough the coffee, so as to have a bright infusion instead of a muddy\r\ndecoction.\r\n\r\n“Tea,” observes Dr. Sigmond, “as the morning beverage, when breakfast\r\nforms a good substantial meal, upon which the powers for the day of\r\nmeeting the various chances and changes of life depend, provided it be\r\nnot strong, is much to be recommended; but when individuals eat little,\r\ncoffee certainly supports them in a more decided manner; and, besides\r\nthis, tea without a certain quantity of solid aliment, is much more\r\nlikely to influence the nervous system. Some persons, if they drink tea\r\nin the morning and coffee at night, suffer much in animal spirits and in\r\npower of enjoyment of the pleasure of society; but if they reverse the\r\nsystem, and take coffee in the morning and tea at night, they reap\r\nbenefit from the change; for the coffee, which to them in the morning is\r\nnutrition, becomes a stimulus at night; and the tea, which acts as a\r\ndilutent at night, gives nothing for support during the day.”\r\n\r\nThe Turks drink their coffee very hot and strong, and without sugar;\r\noccasionally they put in, when boiling, a clove or two bruised, or a few\r\nseeds of star anise, or a drop of essence of amber.\r\n\r\nThe following quotations from recent travellers give the Turkish mode of\r\nmaking coffee:\r\n\r\n“The bruised or ground beans are thrown into a small brass or copper\r\nsaucepan; sufficient water, scalding hot, is poured upon them, and,\r\nafter being allowed to simmer for a few seconds, the liquid is poured\r\ninto small cups, without refining or straining. Persons unaccustomed to\r\nthis way of making coffee find it unpalatable. Those who have overcome\r\nthe first introduction prefer it to that made after the French fashion,\r\nwhereby the aroma is lost or deteriorated. A well made cup of good\r\nTurkish coffee is indeed the most delectable beverage, that can be well\r\nimagined, being grateful to the senses and refreshingly stimulant to the\r\nnerves. Those who have long resided in the East can alone estimate its\r\nmerits.”--WHITE’S _Three Years in Constantinople_.\r\n\r\n“The Turkish way of making coffee produces a very different result from\r\nthat to which we are accustomed. A small conical saucepan, with a long\r\nhandle, and calculated to hold about two table-spoonfuls of water, is\r\nthe instrument used. The fresh roasted berry is pounded, not ground,\r\nand about a dessert-spoonful is put into the minute boiler; it is then\r\nnearly filled with water, and thrust among the embers; a few seconds\r\nsuffice to make it boil, and the decoction, grounds and all, is poured\r\ninto a small cup, which fits into a brass socket much like the cup of an\r\nacorn, and holding the china cup as that does the acorn itself. The\r\nTurks seem to drink this decoction boiling, and swallow the grounds with\r\nthe liquid. We allow it to remain a minute, in order to leave the\r\nsediment at the bottom. It is always taken plain; sugar or cream would\r\nbe thought to spoil it; and Europeans, after a little practice (longer,\r\nhowever, than we had), are said to prefer it to the clear infusion drunk\r\nin France. In every hut you will see these coffee-boilers suspended, and\r\nthe means for pounding the roasted berry will be found at\r\nhand.”--CHRISTMAS’S _Shores and Islands of the Mediterranean_.\r\n\r\n“A small vessel, containing about a wine-glass of water, is placed on\r\nthe fire, and, when boiling, a teaspoonful of ground coffee is put into\r\nit, stirred up, and it is suffered to boil and ‘bubble’ a few seconds\r\nlonger, when it is poured (grounds and all) into a cup about the size of\r\nan egg-shell, encased in gold or silver filigree-work, to protect the\r\nfinger from the heat; and the liquid, in its scalding, black, thick, and\r\ntroubled state, is imbibed with the greatest relish. Like smoking, it\r\nmust be quite an acquired taste.”--MAXWELL’S _Shores of the\r\nMediterranean_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION INTO ENGLAND.--CONTINENTAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term chicory is an Anglicised French word, the original being\r\nchicorée. The plant is known to botanists by the name of _Cichorium\r\nIntybus_, and belongs to the natural order Compositæ, tribe Cichoreæ. It\r\nis an indigenous plant with a perennial root, better known probably to\r\nmost readers by its English appellation of wild succory. The root is\r\nspindle-shaped, with a single or double head; externally it is whitish\r\nor greenish yellow; internally, whitish, fleshy, and milky. The roots\r\ngrown in this country are smaller, and more woody or fibrous than those\r\nwhich are imported from the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation and consumption of chicory have now attained a very\r\ngreat importance, not only on the Continent, but also in the United\r\nKingdom. Dating its extended use chiefly from the system pursued by the\r\nfirst Napoleon to substitute home-grown for colonial products, it has\r\ngradually become approved and popularised for a beverage, either used\r\nalone or more generally mixed with coffee, in numerous countries, where\r\nit can be sold far under the price of even the lowest grade coffees.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of a factitious coffee from roasted chicory-root would\r\nseem to have originated in Holland, where it has been used for more than\r\na century. It remained a secret until 1801, when it was introduced into\r\nFrance by M. Orban of Liége, and M. Giraud of Homing, a short distance\r\nfrom Valenciennes. This root is not superior to many others which\r\npossess sweet and mucous principles, but of all the plants which have\r\nbeen proposed as substitutes for coffee, and which, when roasted and\r\nsteeped in boiling water, yield an infusion resembling the berry, it is\r\nthe only one which has maintained its ground. The French, not satisfied\r\nwith chicory, have recently introduced acorn coffee and roasted\r\nbeetroot. The beet, it is asserted, besides communicating its hygienic\r\nqualities, also helps to sweeten the beverage. This new coffee is called\r\n“café de betterave,” as the old was called “café chicorée.” These\r\ndistinctions will soon become as puzzling as those in America, which led\r\nthe Irish waiter to ask if the gentleman would have coffee-tay or\r\ntay-tay.\r\n\r\nMr. George Phillips, when giving evidence before Mr. Scholefield’s\r\nParliamentary Committee on Adulteration, in 1855, stated that, prior to\r\nthe year 1832, little was heard of the use of chicory in this country,\r\nbut in the subsequent three years its use had gradually so increased\r\nthat the Board of Inland Revenue was obliged to take steps against the\r\nsale. “I have no doubt (he adds), from my own experience, that a very\r\nlarge bulk of the public prefer the mixture. That, however, is a matter\r\nof taste. The trade contend that good coffee, mixed with one-eighth part\r\nof chicory, and sold at a moderate price, makes a better beverage than\r\nordinary coffee would do at the same price, and the great mass of the\r\npublic prefer it. Chicory sold as coffee yields a certain profit, but\r\nprobably it equalises itself in the general competition of trade. There\r\nis a large quantity of chicory sold by itself, and drank as a beverage\r\nin the neighbourhood of Manchester and Liverpool. I believe the price of\r\na pound of the cheapest kind of coffee, purchased by the bulk of the\r\npoor people, and a pound of the mixture, is about the same. The trade\r\nsay, when we use a portion of chicory we use a better coffee. I do not\r\nknow the fact of my own knowledge. Whether the coffee sold in mixtures\r\nis of a superior quality to that sold as a pure article would be very\r\ndifficult to ascertain; it depends upon the question of taste and aroma.\r\nThe chicory itself is not always pure.”\r\n\r\nOn the first introduction of chicory into Great Britain a nominal duty\r\nof 20 per cent. was levied on it, which, owing to the representations of\r\nthe coffee-planters, was afterwards increased to the same rate as that\r\nthen payable on British plantation coffee. The high duty thus levied on\r\nforeign-grown chicory soon led to its cultivation in England, but so\r\nlittle was known of the plant that the farmers required the rent to be\r\npaid in advance for the use of their land. In the autumn of 1853 we find\r\nchicory grown in Kent, Surrey, and Essex, where the article was\r\nprepared, and met with a large sale. With the increasing demand for the\r\nroot, its culture spread to Bedford, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire,\r\nLeicestershire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire. At first the price realised was\r\nas high as 50_l._ per ton ground, and 20_l._ per ton in the root. But as\r\nthe growth extended the price receded. The admission, duty free, of\r\nforeign-grown chicory, in 1854, led to the abandonment of much of the\r\nhome culture.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Mr. McCulloch assumed the growth and consumption of chicory in\r\nthe United Kingdom to be 6¾ million pounds; in 1850, from careful\r\ninquiries I instituted, I estimated the consumption then to be double\r\nthat amount. Mr. Braithwaite Poole, in his “Statistics of Commerce,”\r\npublished in 1852, rated the actual production of chicory-root, made\r\ninto powder in England and Guernsey, then as high as 14,000 tons, worth,\r\nat 22_l._ per ton, 308,000_l._ The gradually increasing imports of\r\nforeign-grown replaces much formerly produced at home, but the changes\r\nin legislative enactments have much interfered with the consumption of\r\nchicory here, and hence the import is not so remunerative. From 1856 to\r\n1859 the imports of foreign chicory in the root rose from 81,721 cwts.\r\nto 267,000 cwts., but there has since been a gradual decline to 45,563\r\ncwts. in 1862. The value has ranged from 6s. to 10s. 6d. per cwt.\r\n\r\nThe largest quantity comes from Belgium, the next from Holland, and a\r\nlittle from Hamburg and other quarters. There are also some considerable\r\nimports of roasted and ground chicory, which is chiefly re-exported;\r\n76,206 lbs. of chicory-powder were imported in 1862.\r\n\r\nRoasted and reduced to powder chicory is the most universal substitute\r\nfor coffee in the chief continental countries, especially in France,\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Russia, and other\r\nNorthern States. In Germany, the ground chicory is made up into cakes,\r\nand sold in that form. Denmark and the Duchies consume about 3,000,000\r\nlbs. annually. A few years ago the annual import of chicory-root into\r\nHamburg was 24,600 cwts., and of ground chicory and other coffee\r\nsubstitutes 13,000 cwts.\r\n\r\nBelgium exports 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 lbs. yearly. The quantity of the\r\ndried root consumed in France is about 16,000,000 lbs. a year. Formerly\r\nthey were able to export 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 lbs., but now enough is\r\nnot produced for home consumption. In 1860, about 10,000,000 lbs. of\r\nchicory-root was imported into France, chiefly from Belgium, and about\r\n660,000 lbs. of chicory in powder was exported, chiefly to Algeria. Till\r\nwithin a few years the cultivation was carried on principally near\r\nValenciennes, but lately manufactories have sprung up in several\r\nlocalities, especially at Arras, Cambray, Lille, Paris, Senlis, in\r\nNormandy, Brittany, &c. In some parts of Germany the women are becoming\r\nregular chicory-topers, making of it an important part of their daily\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION, HARVESTING, AND PREPARATION FOR MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of this plant, the greater part of which have\r\nblue flowers; some are white, and others red. In Brunswick they only\r\ngrow the broad-leaved, or native kind, or the small-leaved, which has\r\nlong roots, and is a native of Magdeburg. The former is, however,\r\npreferred, on account of its being the richest. In Altona they grow a\r\nmedium variety, which has neither very narrow nor very broad leaves. The\r\nplant thrives in all soils that will grow carrots; indeed, the mode of\r\ncultivating one is much like that of the other. The roots seem, however,\r\nto grow best upon a loamy soil, with a clayey subsoil, dry, deep, and\r\nrich. It very seldom thrives in heavy clay land, and never in sand or\r\nwet land. It requires much manure. In preparing the land deep ploughing\r\nis recommended; but, unless the soil is very deep, it is probable that\r\nsubsoil ploughing will answer better. The surface must be well worked;\r\nindeed, it cannot be reduced to too fine a mould.\r\n\r\nAs the plants are a long time in coming up, generally five or six weeks\r\nfrom the time of sowing the seed, it is necessary that the land should\r\nbe very clean, or the weeds (particularly chickweed) are liable to\r\novertop and smother the young plants. The time of sowing varies in\r\ndifferent districts; in the midland and eastern counties of England, the\r\nsecond or third week in May is considered best, for if sown earlier,\r\nmany of the plants will run to seed, in which case they are called\r\n“runners” or “trumpeters,” and must be carefully dug out and destroyed\r\nwhen the time for taking up has arrived, because if allowed to become\r\nmixed with the bulk, they will spoil the sample. The best crops have\r\nbeen obtained when the seed has been sown broadcast; but the preference\r\nis usually given to drilling, the crop being more easily hoed and\r\ncleansed. The rows are generally from 9 to 12 inches apart, and about 3\r\nor 4 lbs. of seed per acre is the quantity used.\r\n\r\nMost of the cultivators of chicory single out the plants so as to leave\r\nspaces between them in the rows, each about 6 or 8 inches long; but\r\nthere are many who do not do this, fancying that four or five small\r\nplants produce more weight of root than one large plant; the expediency\r\nof this, however, is very questionable, as it does not allow of the land\r\nbeing nearly so well cleaned as when the practice of singling is\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn October or November, the work of taking up the roots may be\r\ncommenced, and continued during the winter (if the crop cannot be\r\npreviously secured), until it is finished. Although the roots penetrate\r\na long way downwards, they become too thin below 14 or 15 inches to be\r\nuseful, and the utmost care is also required in order to get up that\r\nportion of the root which will prove profitable.\r\n\r\nIn some cases chicory has been ploughed up, about 12 inches deep, with a\r\nstrong cast-iron plough drawn by six horses, having men to fork each\r\nfurrow to pieces with common potato-forks before a second furrow is\r\nploughed upon it, and women and children following to pick up the roots\r\nand cut off the tops.\r\n\r\nBut the best method is found to be that of digging up the roots with\r\ndouble-pronged strongly-made iron forks, the blades being about 14\r\ninches in length, and each fork, with shaft and handle complete,\r\nweighing about 8 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe plan of ploughing is liable to bring too much of the subsoil to the\r\nsurface, and costs quite as much, if not more, than digging.\r\n\r\nThe advantage which is looked for in ploughing, is to ensure getting the\r\nroots up from a greater depth than can be done by digging, as a great\r\nnumber break off about 8 or 9 inches long, unless a boy is employed to\r\nassist the diggers, and is very careful to pull the top at the precise\r\ntime that the man presses the root upward with his fork.\r\n\r\nWhen dug, the tops should be neatly cut off, and the roots conveyed to\r\nthe washing-house to be cleaned. Sometimes they are earthed in pits,\r\nbut, generally speaking, they are taken to the washing-house immediately\r\nafter being dug up.\r\n\r\nIn the former case, on the Continent, the roots, with the leaves cut\r\noff, are thrown, in heaps of from four to six feet in length, width, and\r\nheight, on the surface of the ground; some straw and then some earth are\r\nput around. But generally the growers deliver the roots to the\r\nmanufacturers from the latter end of August to November, by whom they\r\nare immediately dried.\r\n\r\nThe root is from 2 to 4 inches thick, 3 to 7 inches long, and\r\noccasionally, in a good soil, 3 lbs. in weight. In Brunswick they obtain\r\nfrom 4 to 6 tons of root per Brunswick acre.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the crop depends entirely upon the richness or poverty of\r\nthe soil, the tillage and manure it has received, and other\r\ncircumstances. The fault in England is the striving to grow as heavy a\r\ncrop as possible, to the very great detriment of the quality of the root\r\nfor powder.\r\n\r\nIn Brunswick the price of the root in the original state varies from\r\n20s. to 40s. per ton, according as the crops have been good or bad, and\r\nan acre will realise from 5_l._ to 7_l._ The cost for cultivation is\r\nfrom 3_l._ 15s. to 4_l._ 10s.; 1½ to 2 tons is about an average crop.\r\n\r\nMr. William Strickney, who has grown and prepared chicory for the\r\nmanufacturer to a very great extent, on a large farm near Hull,\r\nestimates the expense of the cultivation of chicory there at 4_l._ 5s.\r\n6d. per acre, and if we add to this 2_l._ 10s. for rent, manure, &c., it\r\ngives 6_l._ 15s. 6d. The produce on suitable land he states to be from 8\r\nto 12 tons per acre, and it requires 4 tons of green root to make 1 ton\r\nof dried. In the dried state the root is worth from 12_l._ to 24_l._ per\r\nton. Take 10 tons per acre, at 2_l._ 10s. per ton, and this would leave\r\na profit per acre of 18_l._ 4s. 6d.\r\n\r\nAnother competent agricultural authority states that the price of 2¼\r\ntons of dry root for the acre, at 12_l._ per ton, would be 27_l._;\r\ndeducting 7_l._ for rent, labour, and other expenses, this would leave a\r\nprofit of 20_l._ per acre.\r\n\r\nThe roots are cut into small pieces of about half-inch or three-quarter\r\ninch lengths by a turnip-cutter, or by hand, the object being to have\r\nthe pieces of as uniform a size as possible. The slices are then dried\r\nin a kiln: this process wasting the chicory from 75 to 80 per cent. It\r\nis then marketable, and is usually sold to the drysalters and grocers,\r\nwho roast and grind it as they do coffee. In the ground state it may be\r\nkept for years, but it soon cakes. The roasted root is emptied into iron\r\nvessels, and, after cooling, is crushed in vertical stone mills, or\r\nbetween iron cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe dried roots cut are roasted in this country like coffee. The loss\r\nduring roasting is from 25 to 30 per cent. The roasters generally\r\nintroduce into the roasting machine about 2 lbs. of lard for every cwt.\r\nof chicory. Some say this is to give the chicory a better face, others\r\nstate that it renders the powder less hygrometric. Inferior kinds of\r\nchicory are alleged to be coloured with Venetian red.\r\n\r\nChicory is occasionally adulterated with roasted pulse (called Hambro’\r\npowder), damaged corn, and coffee husks (“coffee flights,” as they are\r\ntechnically termed). We have also heard of parsnips having been roasted,\r\nground, and mixed with chicory. Dr. Hassall gives a long list of other\r\nsubstances which have been found as adulterants of coffee.\r\n\r\nTreacle is sometimes introduced into fictitious chicory, to give the\r\ncaramel or saccharine odour possessed by real chicory.\r\n\r\nDr. Hassall says the roasted chicory root yields from 45 to 65 per cent.\r\nof soluble extractive. Its solution in water is acid, and it does not\r\npossess the peculiar bitter taste of the raw root; but the taste of the\r\nliquid is more like that of burnt sugar. The copper test shows the\r\npresence of from 10 to 13 per cent. of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following analysis represents the per-centage composition of chicory\r\nroot in its different conditions:\r\n\r\n                              Raw root.

The infusion was\r\ndark-coloured, thick, destitute of the agreeable and refreshing aroma so\r\ncharacteristic of coffee, and was of a bitter taste.\r\n\r\nEach individual experienced for some time after drinking this infusion a\r\nsensation of heaviness, drowsiness, a feeling of weight at the stomach,\r\nand great indisposition to exertion; in two headache set in, and in the\r\nthird the bowels were relaxed. In second and third trials of the chicory\r\nbreakfast the same feelings of drowsiness, weight of the stomach, and\r\nwant of energy were experienced, but no headache or diarrhœa. Several\r\nother trials were subsequently made, with nearly similar results. But\r\nchicory, it will be said, is seldom taken alone in this country, and\r\nwhen mixed with coffee these effects are not produced.\r\n\r\nTwo persons partook, for a considerable period, twice a day, of an\r\narticle denominated coffee, costing 1s. 6d. a pound, and largely\r\nadulterated with chicory; during nearly the whole of this time they both\r\nsuffered more or less from diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of these trials, therefore, we are warranted in\r\nconcluding that at least some doubt is attached to the assertion of the\r\nwholesome properties of chicory-root as an article of diet.\r\n\r\nSeveral characters, sufficiently simple and easily recognised for\r\ngeneral application, have been indicated in different works for\r\ndetecting the addition of roasted chicory to coffee in the roasted and\r\nground state, but the application of chemical reagents for detecting the\r\npresence of the colouring matter of roasted chicory, when added to\r\ninfusion of coffee, has not yet proved successful.\r\n\r\nThe brownish-yellow colouring matter which is developed in chicory-root\r\nby the process of roasting, when dissolved in water by infusion or\r\ndecoction, retains its colour, or becomes a little deeper by the action\r\nof persalts of iron, without giving rise to any precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe brown colouring matter of roasted coffee, on the other hand,\r\nacquires, from the same reagent, a green colour, and a brownish-green\r\nflocculent precipitate is formed. These two different reactions may be\r\napplied, not only for distinguishing the pure infusion of coffee and of\r\nchicory, but also those which contain a mixture of the soluble\r\nprinciples of the two alimentary substances.\r\n\r\nInfusion of pure coffee acquires a green colour, more or less intense,\r\non the addition of some drops of persulphate of iron.\r\n\r\nInfusion of pure chicory, under similar circumstances, retains its\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, which becomes more intense, and acquires a\r\nslight greenish tint.\r\n\r\nA mixture of the two infusions, containing one-half, a fourth, or a\r\nfifth of its volume of infusion of chicory, may be recognised by its\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, which remains after the deposition of the\r\nprecipitate produced by the salt of iron, together with part of the\r\ncolouring matter of the coffee. This separation may be expedited by\r\nrendering the coloured liquor slightly alkaline by the addition of a\r\nsmall quantity of weak solution of ammonia, and allowing it to stand in\r\ntubes closed at one end. The supernatant liquor, after the precipitate\r\nhas deposited, will possess a brownish-yellow tint by refracted light,\r\nwhich will be deeper in proportion to the quantity of chicory present.\r\n\r\nIf the experiment be first made with infusion of pure coffee of a\r\ncertain strength, and afterwards with additions of known quantities of\r\nchicory, keeping these for comparison, the quantity of chicory in a\r\nmixed sample may be thus determined.[2]\r\n\r\nA simple means of detecting the chicory in ground coffee is as follows:\r\n\r\nThrow about a tea-spoonful of the suspected coffee in a wine-glass of\r\nwater, and stir the mixture with a spoon. If\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 10.\r\n\r\nFragment of Roasted Chicory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Fragment of Roasted Coffee, being magnified 140\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\nthe coffee be pure, it for the most part floats, becomes very slowly\r\nmoistened, even when shaken up with the water, and communicates scarcely\r\nany colour to the liquid; very gradually it imbibes water; the liquid\r\nacquires a very pale sherry tint; and at the end of several hours the\r\ngreater part of the powder is found to have fallen to the bottom of the\r\nglass. If, however, it be chicorised, the presence of chicory (genuine\r\nor spurious) will be readily detected, by a portion of the suspected\r\npowder rapidly sinking and communicating to the liquid a reddish-brown\r\ntint, which will be more or less deep according to the amount of chicory\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf the coffee be adulterated with what is called Hambro’ powder (roasted\r\nand ground peas, &c., coloured with Venetian red) or roasted corn, we\r\nhave a further test in iodine, which communicates a purplish or\r\nbluish-red tint to the water to which either of these substances has\r\nbeen added. The preceding test is sufficiently delicate and valuable, in\r\nall ordinary cases, for detecting chicory in coffee; but to those\r\nfamiliar with microscopic investigations, the microscope furnishes\r\nanother mode of proceeding: fragments of dotted ducts being found in\r\nchicory, but not in pure coffee. They are not met with, however, in\r\ngreat abundance; and some patience and care, therefore, are requisite in\r\nsearching for them. The starch grains of Hambro’ powder are readily\r\ndetected by the microscope, as also the blackening effect of a solution\r\nof iodine on them.\r\n\r\nPlate 10 represents the structure and character of genuine ground\r\nroasted coffee, and of a fragment of roasted chicory-root, showing the\r\ndotted or interrupted spiral vessels which pass in bundles through the\r\ncentral parts of the root, magnified 140 diameters; copied, by\r\npermission, from Dr. Hassall’s work on “Food and its Adulterations.”\r\n\r\nIn the raw chicory-root three parts or structures may be distinguished\r\nwith facility, cells, dotted vessels, and vessels of the latex. These\r\nvessels afford useful means of distinguishing chicory from some other\r\nroots employed in the adulteration of coffee. The chief part of the root\r\nis made up of little utricles or cells. These are generally of a rounded\r\nform, but sometimes they are narrow and elongated. The former occur when\r\nthe pressure is least and the root soft, the latter in the neighbourhood\r\nof the vessels.[3]\r\n\r\nThere are four characters by which adulterated chicory may be\r\ndistinguished from the genuine.\r\n\r\n1st. It yields to cold water a much whiter colour. In using this test it\r\nis necessary to have a sample of genuine chicory for comparison.\r\n\r\n2ndly. A decoction of chicory containing either roasted grain or pulse,\r\nyields when cold a purplish or bluish-black colour, with a solution of\r\niodine; whereas a corresponding decoction of genuine chicory is merely\r\ncoloured brown by iodine.\r\n\r\n3rdly. The microscope detects in adulterated chicory the torrefied\r\nstarch grains of either corn or pulse. That they are starch grains is\r\nshown by the action of a solution of iodine, which blackens them.\r\n\r\n4thly. The odour and flavour will sometimes detect adulterations.\r\n\r\nRoasted and ground chicory attracts water from the air, and thereby\r\nincreases in weight and becomes clammy. The grinders are accustomed to\r\nreturn as much by weight of ground chicory as they receive of the\r\nunground root, for the loss which the root suffers by grinding is more\r\nthan compensated by the absorption of water from the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.
