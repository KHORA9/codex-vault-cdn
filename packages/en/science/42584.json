HENRY WOODWARD, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nKEEPER OF GEOLOGY, NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been requested by my friend Mr. Hutchinson, to express my\r\nopinion upon the series of drawings which have been prepared by that\r\nexcellent artist of animals, Mr. Smit, for this little book entitled\r\n\"Extinct Monsters.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the stories told in early days, of Giants and Dragons, may\r\nhave originated in the discovery of the limb-bones of the Mammoth, the\r\nRhinoceros, or other large animals, in caves, associated with heaps of\r\nbroken fragments, in which latter the ignorant peasant saw in fancy\r\nthe remains of the victims devoured at the monster's repasts.\r\n\r\nIn Louis Figuier's _World before the Deluge_ we are favoured with\r\nseveral highly sensational views of extinct monsters; whilst the pen\r\nof Dr. Kinns has furnished valuable information as to the \"slimy\"\r\nnature of their blood!\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. G. Waterhouse Hawkins (formerly a lithographic artist)\r\nwas for years occupied in unauthorised restorations of various\r\nSecondary reptiles and Tertiary mammals, and about 1853 he received\r\nencouragement from Professor Owen to undertake the restorations of\r\nextinct animals which still adorn the lower grounds of the Crystal\r\nPalace at Sydenham.\r\n\r\nBut the discoveries of later years have shown that the Dicynodon and\r\nLabyrinthodon, instead of being toad-like in form, were lacertilian or\r\nsalamander-like reptiles, with elongated bodies and moderately long\r\ntails; that the Iguanodon did not usually stand upon \"all-fours,\" but\r\nmore frequently sat up like some huge kangaroo with short fore limbs;\r\nthat the horn on its snout was really on its wrist; that the\r\nMegalosaurus, with a more slender form of skeleton, had a somewhat\r\nsimilar erect attitude, and the habit, perhaps, of springing upon its\r\nprey, holding it with its powerful clawed hands, and tearing it with\r\nits formidable carnivorous teeth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Bernissart Iguanodon has been to us a complete revelation\r\nof what a Dinosaur really looked like, it is to America, and chiefly\r\nto the discoveries of Marsh, that we owe the knowledge of a whole\r\nseries of new reptiles and mammals, many of which will be found\r\nillustrated within these pages.\r\n\r\nOf long and short-tailed Pterodactyles we now know almost complete\r\nskeletons and details of their patagia or flying membranes. The\r\ndiscovery of the long-tailed feathered bird with teeth--the\r\nArchæopteryx, from the Oolite of Solenhofen, is another marvellous\r\naddition to our knowledge; whilst Marsh's great Hesperornis, a\r\nwingless diving bird with teeth, and his flying toothed bird, the\r\nIchthyornis dispar, are to us equally surprising.\r\n\r\nCertainly, both in singular forms of fossil reptilia and in early\r\nmammals, North America carries off the palm.\r\n\r\nOf these the most remarkable are Marsh's Stegosaurus, a huge torpid\r\nreptile, with very small head and teeth, about twenty feet in length,\r\nand having a series of flattened dorsal spines, nearly a yard in\r\nheight, fixed upon the median line of its back; and his Triceratops,\r\nanother reptile bigger than Stegosaurus, having a huge neck-shield\r\njoined to its skull, and horns on its head and snout. Nor do the\r\nEocene mammals fall short of the marvellous, for in Dinoceras we find\r\na beast with six horns, and sword-bayonet tusks, joined to a skeleton\r\nlike an elephant.\r\n\r\nLatest amongst the marvels in modern palæontological discovery has\r\nbeen that made by Professor Fraas of the outline of the skin and fins\r\nin Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris, which shows it to have been a veritable\r\nshark-like reptile, with a high dorsal fin and broad fish-tail, so\r\nthat \"fish-lizard\" is more than ever an appropriate term for these old\r\nLiassic marine reptiles.\r\n\r\nAs every palæontologist is well aware, restorations are ever liable to\r\nemendation, and that the present and latest book of extinct monsters\r\nwill certainly prove no exception to the rule is beyond a doubt, but\r\nthe author deserves our praise for the very boldness of his attempt,\r\nand the honesty with which he has tried to follow nature and avoid\r\nexaggeration. Every one will admire the simple and unaffected style in\r\nwhich the author has endeavoured to tell his story, avoiding, as far\r\nas possible, all scientific terms, so as to bring it within the\r\nintelligence of the unlearned. He has, moreover, taken infinite pains\r\nto study up his subject with care, and to consult all the literature\r\nbearing upon it. He has thus been enabled to convey accurate\r\ninformation in a simple and pleasing form, and to guide the artist in\r\nhis difficult task with much wisdom and intelligence. That the\r\nexcellence of the sketches is due to the artist, Mr. Smit, is a\r\nmatter of course, and so is the blame, where criticism is legitimate;\r\nand no one is more sensible of the difficulties of the task than Mr.\r\nSmit himself.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself, I am _very well pleased_ with the series of\r\nsketches; and I may say so with the greater ease and freedom from\r\nresponsibility, as I have had very little to do with them, save in one\r\nor two trifling matters of criticism. I may venture, however, to\r\ncommend them to my friends among the public at large as the happiest\r\nset of restorations that has yet appeared.\r\n\r\n    H. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LATE SIR RICHARD OWEN AND A SKELETON OF DINORNIS MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural history is deservedly a popular subject. The manifestations of\r\nlife in all its varied forms is a theme that has never failed to\r\nattract all who are not destitute of intelligence. From the days of\r\nthe primitive cave-dwellers of Europe, who lived with mammoths and\r\nother animals now lost to the world; of the ancient Egyptians, who\r\ndrew and painted on the walls of their magnificent tombs the creatures\r\ninhabiting the delta of the Nile; of the Greeks, looking out on the\r\nworld with their bright and child-like curiosity, down to our own\r\ntimes, this old, yet ever new, theme has never failed. Never before\r\nwas there such a profusion of books describing the various forms of\r\nlife inhabiting the different countries of the globe, or the rivers,\r\nlakes, and seas that diversify its scenery. Popular writers have done\r\ngood service in making the way plain for those who wish to acquaint\r\nthemselves with the structures, habits, and histories of living\r\nanimals; while for students a still greater supply of excellent\r\nmanuals and text-books has been, and still continues to be,\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nBut in our admiration for the present we forget the great past. How\r\nseldom do we think of that innumerable host of creatures that once\r\ntrod this earth! How little in comparison has been done for _them_!\r\nOur natural-history books deal only with those that are alive now. Few\r\npopular writers have attempted to depict, as on a canvas, the great\r\nearth-drama that has, from age to age, been enacted on the terrestrial\r\nstage, of which we behold the latest, but probably not the closing\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nWhen our poet wrote \"All the world's a stage,\" he thought only of \"men\r\nand women,\" whom he called \"merely players,\" but the geologist sees a\r\nwider application of these words, as he reviews the drama of past life\r\non the globe, and finds that animals, too, have had \"their exits and\r\ntheir entrances;\" nay more, \"the strange eventful history\" of a human\r\nlife, sketched by the master-hand, might well be chosen to illustrate\r\nthe birth and growth of the tree of life, the development of which we\r\nshall briefly trace from time to time, as we proceed on our survey of\r\nthe larger and more wonderful animals of life that flourished in\r\nbygone times.\r\n\r\nWe might even make out a \"seven ages\" of the world, in each of which\r\nsome peculiar form of life stood out prominently, but such a scheme\r\nwould be artificial.\r\n\r\nThere is a wealth of material for reconstructing the past that is\r\nsimply bewildering; and yet little has been done to bring before the\r\npublic the strange creatures that have perished.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Figuier's _World before the Deluge_ is hardly a trustworthy book,\r\nand is often not up to date. The restorations also are misleading.\r\nProfessor Dawson's _Story of the Earth and Man_ is better; but the\r\nillustrations are poor. Nicholson's _Life-History of the Earth_ is a\r\nstudent's book. Messrs. Cassells' _Our Earth and its Story_ deals with\r\nthe whole of geology, and so is too diffusive; its ideal landscapes\r\n\r\nTo the writer it is a matter of astonishment that the\r\nand restorations leave much to be desired.\r\ndiscoveries of Marsh, Cope, Leidy, and others in America, not to\r\nmention some important European discoveries, should have attracted so\r\nlittle notice in this country. In the far and wild West a host of\r\nstrange reptiles and quadrupeds have been unearthed from their rocky\r\nsepulchres, often of incredibly huge proportions, and, in many cases,\r\nmore weird and strange than the imagination could conceive; and yet\r\nthe public have never heard of these discoveries, by the side of which\r\nthe now well-known \"lost creations\" of Cuvier, Buckland, or Conybeare\r\nsink into the shade. For once, we beg leave to suggest, the hungry\r\npressman, seeking \"copy,\" has failed to see a good thing. Descriptions\r\nof some of \"Marsh's monsters\" and how they were found, might, one\r\nwould think, have proved attractive to a public ever on the look out\r\nfor something new.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley, comparing our present knowledge of the mammals of\r\nthe Tertiary era with that of 1859, states that the discoveries of\r\nGaudry, Marsh, and Filhol, are \"as if zoologists were to become\r\nacquainted with a country hitherto unknown, as rich in novel forms of\r\nlife as Brazil or South America once were to Europeans.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to describe some of the larger and more\r\nmonstrous forms of the past--the lost creations of the old world; to\r\nclothe their dry bones with flesh, and suggest for them backgrounds\r\nsuch as are indicated by the discoveries of geology: in other words,\r\nto endeavour, by means of pen and pencil, to bring them back to life.\r\nThe ordinary public cannot learn much by merely gazing at skeletons\r\nset up in museums. One longs to cover their nakedness with flesh and\r\nskin, and to see them as they were when they walked this earth.\r\n\r\nOur present imperfect knowledge renders it difficult in some cases to\r\nconstruct successful restorations; but, nevertheless, the attempt is\r\nworth making: and if some who think geology a very dry subject, can be\r\nconverted to a different opinion on reading these pages, we shall be\r\nwell rewarded for our trouble.\r\n\r\nWe venture to hope that those who will take the trouble to peruse this\r\nbook, or even to look at its pictures, on which much labour and\r\nthought have been expended, will find pleasure in visiting the\r\nsplendid geological collection at Cromwell Road. We have often watched\r\nvisitors walking somewhat aimlessly among those relics of a former\r\nworld, and wished that we could be of some service. But, if this\r\nlittle book should help them the better to understand what they see\r\nthere, our wish will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nAnother object which the writer has kept in view is to connect the\r\npast with the present. It cannot be too strongly urged that the best\r\ncommentary on the dead past is the living present. It is unfortunate\r\nthat there is still too great a tendency to separate, as by a great\r\ngulf, the dead from the living, the past from the present, forms of\r\nlife. The result of this is seen in our museums. Fossils have too\r\noften been left to the attention of geologists not always well\r\nacquainted with the structures of living animals. The more frequent\r\nintroduction of fossil specimens side by side with modern forms of\r\nlife would not only be a gain to the progress and spread of geological\r\nscience, but would be a great help to students of anatomy and natural\r\nhistory. The tree of life is but a mutilated thing, and half its\r\ninterest is gone, when the dead branches are lopped off.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, justifiable to give to the term \"monster\" a somewhat\r\nextended meaning. The writer has therefore included in his menagerie\r\nof extinct animals one or two creatures which, though not of any great\r\nsize, are nevertheless remarkable in various ways--such, for instance,\r\nas the winged reptiles, and anomalous birds with teeth, of later\r\ntimes, and others. Compared with living forms, these creatures appear\r\nto us as \"monstrosities,\" and may well find a place in our collection.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes, in a few words, to thank those friends who have\r\nrendered him assistance in his task.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., Keeper of Geology, Natural History Museum,\r\nhas from the first taken a lively interest in this little book. He\r\nkindly helped the author with his advice on difficult matters,\r\ncriticising some of the artist's preliminary sketches and suggesting\r\nimprovements in the restorations. With unfailing courtesy he has ever\r\nbeen willing, in spite of many demands on his time, to place his\r\nknowledge at the disposal of both the author and artist; and in this\r\nway certain errors have been avoided. Besides this, he took the\r\ntrouble to read through the proof-sheets, and made suggestions and\r\ncorrections which have greatly improved the text. For all this welcome\r\naid the author begs to return his sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Smith Woodward, of the Natural History Museum, the author is\r\nalso much indebted for his kindness in reading through the text and\r\ngiving valuable information with regard to the latest discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe artist, Mr. Smit, notwithstanding the novelty of the subject and\r\nthe difficulties of the task, has thrown himself heartily into the\r\nwork of making the twenty-four restorations of extinct animals. To\r\nhim, also, the author is greatly indebted, and considers himself\r\nfortunate in having secured the services of so excellent an artist.\r\n\r\nTo the publishers his thanks are due for their liberality in the\r\nmatter of illustrations, and the readiness with which they have\r\nresponded to suggestions.\r\n\r\nWith regard to minor illustrations the following acknowledgments are\r\ndue:--\r\n\r\nTo the Palæontological Society of Great Britain for permission to\r\nreproduce three of the illustrations in Sir Richard Owen's great work,\r\n_British Fossil Reptiles_, published in their yearly volumes, viz.\r\nFigs. 3, 4, and 8.\r\n\r\nTo Messrs. Bell and Co. for the following cuts from the late Dr.\r\nGideon A. Mantell's works: viz. Figs. 12, 14, 20, 33, 37, 38.\r\n\r\nTo Messrs. A. and C. Black for the following cuts from Owen's\r\n_Palæontology_: viz. Figs. 51, 54, 56, 57.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppendix IV. contains a list of some of the works of which the writer\r\nhas made use; but it would be impossible within reasonable limits to\r\nenumerate all the separate papers which have necessarily been\r\nconsulted. The reader will find numerous references, such as \"Case Y\r\non Plan,\" in brackets; these refer to the plan given at the end of the\r\nexcellent little _Guide to the Exhibition Galleries in the Department\r\nof Geology and Palæontology in the Natural History Museum_, Cromwell\r\nRoad (price one shilling), which visitors to the Museum are advised to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a second edition affords the author a pleasant\r\nopportunity of thanking the reading public, and the Press, for the\r\nkind way in which his endeavour to popularise the results of modern\r\nPalæontology has been received. There seem to be fashions in all\r\nthings--even in sciences; and perhaps the wonderful advances we have\r\nwitnessed of late years in the physical sciences on the one hand, and\r\nin biological sciences on the other, may have tended to throw\r\nPalæontology somewhat into the shade. Let us hope that it will not\r\nremain there long.\r\n\r\nA large number of illustrations have been added for the present\r\nedition, besides additional matter here and there in the text. Three\r\nof the plates (viz. Plates II. X. XV.) have been redrawn. Plate II.\r\nshows the Ichthyosaurus as interpreted by the latest discovery from\r\nWürtemberg. Plate X. gives a somewhat different interpretation of the\r\nStegosaurus, suggested by some remarks of Mr. Lydekker.\r\n\r\nA slight change will be noticed in Plate XV. (Brontops). Plate XVII.\r\nis a great improvement on the old drawing (Fig. 28, old edition) of\r\nthe Megatherium skeleton. Plate XXIV., besides containing a valuable\r\nportrait of the late Sir Richard Owen, gives another drawing of the\r\nDinornis skeleton.\r\n\r\n    _April, 1893._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\n  Preface by Dr. Henry Woodward                                 v\r\n  Author's Preface                                             ix\r\n  Preface to Second Edition                                    xv\r\n  Introduction                                                  1\r\n  CHAPTER I.

True, it was not inhabited by\r\n\"slithy toves\" or \"jabber-wocks,\" but by real beasts, of whose shapes,\r\nsizes, and habits much is already known--a good deal more than might\r\nat first be supposed. And yet, real as it all is, this antique\r\nworld--this panorama of scenes that have for ever passed away--is a\r\nveritable fairy-land. In those days of which geologists tell us, the\r\nprincipal parts were played, not by kings and queens, but by creatures\r\nmany of which were very unlike those we see around us now. And yet it\r\nis no fairy-land after all, where impossible things happen, and where\r\nimpossible dragons figure largely; but only the same old world in\r\nwhich you and I were born. Everything you will see here is quite true.\r\nAll these monsters once lived. Truth is stranger than fiction; and\r\nperhaps we shall enjoy our visit to this fairy-land all the more for\r\nthat reason. For not even the dragons supposed to have been slain by\r\narmed knights in old times, when people gave ear to any tale, however\r\nextravagant, could equal in size or strength the real dragons we shall\r\npresently meet with, whose actual bones may be seen in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nMany people who visit this great museum and find their way to the\r\ngeological galleries on the right, pass hastily by the cases of bones,\r\nteeth, and skeletons. These things, it seems, fail to interest them.\r\nThey do not know how to interpret them. They cannot picture to\r\nthemselves the kinds of creatures to which the relics once belonged;\r\nand so they pass them by and presently go to the more attractive\r\ncollection of stuffed birds on the other side. There they see the\r\nfeathered tribes of the air all beautifully arranged; some poised in\r\nthe air by almost invisible wires; some perched on branches: but all\r\nsurrounded by grass, flowers, and natural objects, imitated with\r\nmarvellous reality, so that they see the birds as they really are in\r\nnature, and can almost fancy they hear them singing.\r\n\r\nNow, it has often occurred to the present writer that something more\r\nmight be done for the long-neglected \"lost creations\" of the world, to\r\nbring them out of their obscurity, that they may be made to tell to\r\nthe passer-by their wondrous story. We can, however, well imagine some\r\nof our readers asking, \"Can these dry bones live?\" \"Yes,\" we would\r\nsay, \"they can be made to live; reason and imagination will, if we\r\ngive them proper play, provide us eyes wherewith to see the world's\r\nlost creations.\" To such men as Cuvier, Owen, Huxley, and others,\r\nthese dry bones _do_ live. It will be our object to describe to the\r\nreader some of the wonderful results that have rewarded the lifelong\r\nlabours of such great men. We shall take some of the largest and\r\nstrangest forms of life that once lived, and try to picture them as\r\nthey really were when alive, whether walking on land, swimming in the\r\nsea, or flying in the air; to understand the meanings of their more\r\nobvious structures; and to form some conclusions with regard to their\r\nhabits, as well as to find out, if possible, their relations,--as far\r\nas such questions have been answered by those most qualified to settle\r\nthese difficult matters.\r\n\r\nAll technical details, such as the general reader is unfamiliar with,\r\nwill be as far as possible suppressed. Let us fancy a long procession\r\nof extinct monsters passing in single file before us, and ourselves\r\nendeavouring to pick out their \"points\" as they present themselves to\r\nthe eye of imagination. It is not, be it remembered, mere imagination\r\nthat guides the man of science in such matters, for all his\r\nconclusions are carefully based on reason; and when conclusions are\r\ngiven, we shall endeavour to show how they have been arrived at.\r\n\r\nFor millions of years countless multitudes of living animals have\r\nplayed their little parts on the earth and passed away, to be buried\r\nup in the oozy beds of the seas of old time, or entombed with the\r\nleaves that sank in the waters of primæval lakes. The majority of\r\nthese perished beyond all recovery, leaving not a trace behind; yet a\r\nvast number of fossilised remains have been, in various ways,\r\npreserved; sometimes almost as completely as if Dame Nature had\r\nthoughtfully embalmed them for our instruction and delight.\r\n\r\nDown in those old seas and lakes she kept her great museum, in order\r\nto preserve for us a selection of her treasures. In course of time she\r\nslowly raised up sea-beds and lake-bottoms to make them into dry land.\r\nThis museum is everywhere around us. We have but to enter quarries and\r\nrailway cuttings, or to search in coal-mines, or under cliffs at the\r\nsea-side, and we can consult her records. As the ancient Egyptians\r\nbuilt tombs, pyramids, and temples, from which we may learn their\r\nmanner of life and partly read their history, so Nature has entombed,\r\nnot one race only, but many races of the children of life. Her\r\nrecords are written in strange hieroglyphs, yet it is not difficult to\r\ninterpret their meaning; and thus many an old story, many an old\r\nscene, may be pictured in the mind of man.\r\n\r\nShall we call this earth-drama a tragedy or a comedy? Doubtless tragic\r\nscenes occurred at times; as, for instance, when fierce creatures\r\nengaged in deadly combat: and probably amusing, if not comic,\r\nincidents took place occasionally, such as might have provoked us to\r\nlaughter, had we been there to see them. But let us simply call it a\r\ndrama. Backgrounds of scenery were not wanting. Then, as now, the\r\nsurface of the earth was clothed with vegetation, and strange cattle\r\npastured on grassy plains. Vegetation was at times very luxuriant. The\r\nforests of the coal period, with their giant reeds and club-moss\r\ntrees, must have made a strange picture. Then, as now, there rose up\r\nfrom the plains lofty ranges of mountains, reaching to the clouds,\r\ntheir summits clothed with the eternal snows. These, too, played their\r\npart, feeding the streams and the rivers that meandered over the\r\nplains, bringing life and fertility with them, as they do now. The sun\r\nshone and the wind blew: sometimes gently, so that the leaves just\r\nwhispered in an evening breeze; at other times so violently that the\r\ngiants of the forest swayed to and fro, and the seas lashed themselves\r\nfuriously against rocky coasts. Nor were the underground forces of the\r\nearth less active than they are now: volcanic eruptions often took\r\nplace on a magnificent scale; volcanoes poured out fiery lava streams\r\nfor leagues beneath their feet; great showers of ashes and fine dust\r\nwere ejected in the air, so that the sun was darkened for a time, and\r\nthe surface of the sea was covered for many miles with floating pumice\r\nand volcanic dust, which in time sank to the bottom, and was made into\r\nhard rock, such as we now find on the top of Snowdon.\r\n\r\nEarthquake shocks were quite as frequent, and no doubt the ground\r\nswayed to and fro, or was rent open as some unusually great\r\nearth-movement took place, and perhaps a mountain range was raised\r\nseveral feet or yards higher. All this we learn from the testimony of\r\nthe rocks beneath our feet. It only requires the use of a little\r\nimagination to conjure up scenes of the past, and paint them as on a\r\nmoving diorama.\r\n\r\nWe shall not, however, dwell at any length on the scenery, or the\r\nvegetation that clothed the landscape at different periods; for these\r\nfeatures are sufficiently indicated in the beautiful drawings of\r\nextinct animals by our artist, Mr. J. Smit.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the illustrious Baron Cuvier, at Paris, as embodied\r\nin his great work, _Ossemens Fossiles_, gave a great impetus to the\r\nstudy of organic remains. It was he who laid the foundations of the\r\nscience of Palæontology,[2] which, though much has already been\r\naccomplished, yet has a great future before it. Agassiz, Owen, Huxley,\r\nMarsh, Cope, and others, following in his footsteps, have greatly\r\nextended its boundaries; but he was the pioneer.\r\n\r\n[2] Palæontology is the science which treats of the living beings,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable, which have inhabited this globe at past\r\nperiods in its history. (Greek--_palaios_, ancient; _onta_, beings;\r\n_logos_, discourse.)\r\n\r\nBefore his time fossil forms were very little known, and still less\r\nunderstood. His researches, especially among vertebrates, or backboned\r\nanimals, revealed an altogether undreamed-of wealth of entombed\r\nremains. It is true the old and absurd notion that fossils were mere\r\n\"sports of Nature,\" sometimes bearing more or less resemblance to\r\nliving animals, but still only an accidental (!) resemblance, had been\r\nabandoned by Leibnitz, Buffon, and Pallas; and that Daubenton had\r\nactually compared the fossil bones of quadrupeds with those of living\r\nforms; while Camper declared his opinion that some of these remains\r\nbelonged to extinct species of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nIt is to Cuvier, however, that the world owes the first systematic\r\napplication of the science of comparative anatomy, which he himself\r\nhad done so much to place on a sound basis, to the study of the bones\r\nof fossil animals. He paid great attention to the relative shapes of\r\nanimals, and the different developments of the same kind of bones in\r\nvarious animals, and especially to the nature of their teeth. So great\r\ndid his experience and knowledge become, that he rarely failed in\r\nnaming an animal from a part of its skeleton. He appreciated more\r\nclearly than others before him the mutual dependence of the various\r\nparts of an animal's organisation. \"The organism,\" he said, \"forms a\r\nconnected unity, in which the single parts cannot change without\r\nmodifications in the other parts.\"\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be necessary to give examples of this now well-known\r\ntruth; but, just to take one case: the elephant has a long proboscis\r\nwith which it can reach the ground, and consequently its neck is quite\r\nshort; but take away the long proboscis, and you would seriously\r\ninterfere with the relation of various parts of its structure to each\r\nother. How, then, could it reach or pick up anything lying on the\r\nground? Other changes would have to follow: either its legs would\r\nrequire to be shortened, or its neck to be lengthened. In every\r\nanimal, as in a complex machine, there is a mutual dependence of the\r\ndifferent parts.\r\n\r\nAs he progressed in these studies, Cuvier was able with considerable\r\nsuccess to restore extinct animals from their fossilised remains, to\r\ndiscover their habits and manner of life, and to point out their\r\nnearest living ally. To him we owe the first complete demonstration of\r\nthe possibility of restoring an extinct animal. His \"Law of\r\nCorrelation\" however, has been found to be not infallible; as\r\nProfessor Huxley has shown, it has exceptions. It expresses our\r\nexperience among living animals, but, when applied to the more ancient\r\ntypes of life, is liable to be misleading.\r\n\r\nTo take one out of many examples of this law: Carnivorous animals,\r\nsuch as cats, lions, and tigers, have claws in their feet, very\r\ndifferent from the hoofs of an ox, which is herbivorous; while the\r\nteeth of the former group are very different to those of the latter.\r\nThus the teeth and limbs have a certain definite relation to each\r\nother, or, in other words, are correlated. Again, horned quadrupeds\r\nare all herbivorous (or graminivorous), and have hoofs to their feet.\r\nThe following amusing anecdote serves to illustrate Cuvier's law. One\r\nof his students thought he would try and frighten his master, and,\r\nhaving dressed up as a wild beast, entered Cuvier's bedroom by night,\r\nand, presenting himself by his bedside, said in hollow tones, \"Cuvier,\r\nCuvier, I've come to eat you!\" The great naturalist, who on waking up\r\nwas able to discern something with horns and hoofs, simply remarked,\r\n\"What! horns, hoofs--graminivorous--you can't!\" What better lesson\r\ncould the master have given the pupil to help him to remember his \"Law\r\nof Correlation\"?\r\n\r\nCuvier's great work, entitled _Ossemens Fossiles_, will long remain an\r\nimperishable monument of the genius and industry of the greatest\r\npioneer in this region of investigation. This work proved beyond a\r\ndoubt to his astonished contemporaries the great antiquity of the\r\ntribes of animals now living on the surface of the earth. It proved\r\nmore than that, however; for it showed the existence of a great\r\nphilosophy in Nature which linked the past with the present in a\r\nscheme that pointed to a continuity of life during untold previous\r\nages. All this was directly at variance with the prevalent ideas of\r\nhis time, and consequently his views were regarded by many with alarm,\r\nand he received a good deal of abuse--a fate which many other original\r\nthinkers before him have shared.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult for people living now, and accustomed to\r\nmodern teaching, to realise how novel were the conclusions announced\r\nby Cuvier. In his _Discourse on the Revolutions of the Surface of the\r\nGlobe_, translated into most European languages under the title\r\n_Theory of the Earth_, he lays down, among others, the two following\r\npropositions:--\r\n\r\n1. That all organised existences were not created at the same\r\ntime; but at different times, probably very remote from each\r\nother--vegetables before animals, mollusca and fishes before reptiles,\r\nand the latter before mammals.\r\n\r\n2. That fossil remains in the more recent strata are those which\r\napproach nearest to the present type of corresponding living species.\r\n\r\nTeaching such as this gave a new impetus to the study of organic\r\nremains, and Palæontology, as a science, began with Cuvier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHOW EXTINCT MONSTERS ARE PRESERVED.\r\n\r\n     \"Geology, beyond almost every other science, offers fields of\r\n     research adapted to all capacities and to every condition and\r\n     circumstance of life in which we may be placed. For while\r\n     some of its phenomena require the highest intellectual\r\n     powers, and the greatest attainments in abstract science for\r\n     their successful investigation, many of its problems may be\r\n     solved by the most ordinary intellect, and facts replete with\r\n     the deepest interest may be gleaned by the most casual\r\n     observer.\"--Mantell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us suppose we are visiting a geological museum for the first time,\r\npassing along from one department to another with ever-increasing\r\nwonder--now admiring the beautiful polished marbles from Devonshire,\r\nwith their delicate corals, or the wonderful fishes from the Old Red\r\nSandstone, with their plates of enamel; now the delicate shells and\r\nammonites from the Lias or Oolites, with their pearly lustre still\r\npreserved; now the white fresh-looking shells from the Isle of Wight;\r\nnow the ponderous bones and big teeth of ancient monsters from the\r\nWealden beds of Sussex. The question might naturally occur, \"How were\r\nall these creatures preserved from destruction and decay, and sealed\r\nup so securely that it is difficult to believe they are as old as the\r\ngeologists tell us they are?\" It will be worth our while to consider\r\nthis before we pass on to describe the creatures themselves.\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, \"fossils\" are not always \"petrifactions,\" as\r\nsome people seem to think; that is to say, they are not all turned\r\ninto stone. This is true in many cases, no doubt, yet one frequently\r\ncomes across the remains of plants and animals that have undergone\r\nvery little change, and have, as it were, been simply sealed up. The\r\nstate of a fossil depends on several circumstances, such as the soil,\r\nmud, or other medium in which it may happen to be preserved. Again,\r\nthe newest, or most recent, fossils are generally the least altered.\r\nWe have fossils of all ages, and in all states of preservation. As\r\nexamples of fossils very little altered, we may take the case of the\r\nwonderful collection of bones discovered by Professor Boyd Dawkins in\r\ncaves in various parts of Great Britain. The results of many years of\r\nresearch are given in his most interesting book on _Cave-Hunting_.\r\nThis enthusiastic explorer and geologist has discovered the remains of\r\na great many animals, some of which are quite extinct, while others\r\nare still living in this country. These remains belong to a late\r\nperiod, when lions, tigers, cave-bears, wolves, hyænas, and reindeer\r\ninhabited our country. In some cases the caves were the dens of\r\nhyænas, who brought their prey into caverns in our limestone rocks, to\r\ndevour them at their leisure; for the marks of their teeth may yet be\r\nseen on the bones. In other cases the bones seem to have been washed\r\ninto the caves by old streams that have ceased to run; but in all\r\ncases they are fairly fresh, though often stained by iron-rust brought\r\nin by water that has dissolved iron out of various rocks--for iron is\r\na substance met with almost everywhere in nature. Sometimes they are\r\nburied up in a layer of soil, or \"cave-earth,\" and at other times in a\r\nlayer of stalagmite--a deposit of carbonate of lime gradually formed\r\non the floors of caves by the evaporation of water charged with\r\ncarbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nAir and water are great destroyers of animal and vegetable substances\r\nfrom which life has departed. The autumn leaves that fall by the\r\nwayside soon undergo change, and become at last separated or resolved\r\ninto their original elements. In the same way when any wild animal,\r\nsuch as a bird or rabbit, dies in an exposed place, its flesh decays\r\nunder the influence of rain and wind, so that before long nothing but\r\ndry bones is left. Hamlet's wish that this \"too too solid flesh would\r\nmelt\" is soon realised after death; and that active chemical element\r\nin the air known as oxygen, in breathing which we live, has a tenfold\r\npower over dead matter, slowly causing chemical actions somewhat\r\nsimilar to those that take place in a burning candle, whereby decaying\r\nflesh is converted into water-vapour and carbonic acid gas. Thus we\r\nsee that oxygen not only supports life, but breaks up into simpler\r\nforms the unwholesome and dangerous products of decaying matter, thus\r\nkeeping the atmosphere sweet and pure; but in time, even the dry bones\r\nof the bird or rabbit, though able for a longer period to resist the\r\nattacks of the atmosphere, crumble into dust, and serve to fertilise\r\nthe soil that once supported them.\r\n\r\nNow, if water and air be excluded, it is wonderful how long even the\r\nmost perishable things may be preserved from this otherwise universal\r\ndecay. In the Edinburgh museum of antiquities may be seen an old\r\nwooden cask of butter that has lain for centuries in peat--which\r\nsubstance has a curiously preservative power; and human bodies have\r\nbeen dug out of Irish peat with the flesh well preserved, which, from\r\nthe nature of the costume worn by the person, we can tell to be very\r\nancient. Meat packed in tins, so as to be entirely excluded from the\r\nair, may be kept a very long time, and will be found to be quite fresh\r\nand fit for use.\r\n\r\nBut air and water have a way of penetrating into all sorts of places,\r\nso that in nature they are almost everywhere. Water can slowly filter\r\nthrough even the hardest rocks, and since it contains dissolved air,\r\nit causes the decay of animal or vegetable substances. Take the case\r\nof a dead leaf falling into a lake, or some quiet pool in a river. It\r\nsinks to the bottom, and is buried up in gravel, mud, or sand. Now,\r\nour leaf will stand a very poor chance of preservation on a sandy or\r\ngravelly bottom, because these materials, being porous, allow the\r\nwater to pass through them easily. But if it settles down on fine mud\r\nit may be covered up and become a fossil. In time the soft mud will\r\nharden into clay or shale, retaining a delicate impression of the\r\nleaf; and even after thousands of years, the brown body of the leaf\r\nwill be there, only partly changed. In the case of the plants found in\r\ncoal, the lapse of ages since they were buried up has been so great\r\n(and the strata have been so affected by the great pressure and by the\r\nearth's internal heat) that certain chemical changes have converted\r\nleaves and stems into carbon and some of its compounds, much in the\r\nsame way that, if you heat wood in a closed vessel, you convert it\r\ninto charcoal, which is mostly carbon. The coal we burn in our fires\r\nis entirely of vegetable origin, and every seam in a coal-mine is a\r\nburied forest of trees, ferns, reeds, and other plants.\r\n\r\nThe reader will understand how it is that rocks composed of hardened\r\nsand or gravel, sandstones and conglomerates, contain but few fossils;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, such rocks as clay, shale, slate, and\r\nlimestone often abound in fossils, because they are formed of what was\r\nonce soft mud, that sealed up and protected corals, shell-fish,\r\nsea-urchins, fishes, and other marine animals. Had they been covered\r\nup in sand the chances are that percolating water would have slowly\r\ndissolved the shells and corals, the hard coats of the crabs, and the\r\nbones of the fishes, all of which are composed of carbonate of lime;\r\nand we know that is a substance easily dissolved by water.\r\n\r\nIt is in the rocks formed during the later geological periods that we\r\nfind fossils least changed from their original state; for time works\r\ngreat changes, and too little time has elapsed since those periods for\r\nany considerable alterations to have taken place. But when we come to\r\nexamine some of the earlier rocks, which have been acted upon in\r\nvarious ways for long periods of time, such as the pressure of vast\r\npiles of overlying rocks, and the percolation of water charged with\r\nmineral substances (water sometimes warmed by the earth's internal\r\nheat), then we may expect to find the remains of the world's lost\r\ncreations in a much more mineralised condition. Every fossil-collector\r\nmust be familiar with examples of changes of this kind. For instance,\r\nshells originally composed of carbonate of lime are often found to\r\nhave been turned into flint or silica. Another curious change is\r\nillustrated in the case of a stratum found in Cambridgeshire and other\r\ncounties. In this remarkable layer, only about a foot in thickness,\r\none frequently finds bones and teeth of fishes and reptiles. These,\r\nhowever, have all undergone a curious change, whereby they have been\r\nconverted into phosphate of lime--a compound of phosphorus and lime.\r\nIt abounds in \"nodules,\" or lumps, of this substance, which, along\r\nwith thousands of fossils, are every year ground up and converted by a\r\nchemical process into valuable artificial manure for the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe soft parts of animals, as we have said before, cannot be preserved\r\nin a fossil state; but, as if to compensate for this loss, we\r\nsometimes meet with the most faithful and delicate impressions. Thus,\r\ncuttle-fishes have, in some instances, left, on the clays which buried\r\nthem up, impressions of their soft, long arms, or tentacles, and, as\r\nthe mud hardened into solid rock, the impressions are fixed\r\nimperishably. Examples of these interesting records may be seen at the\r\nNatural History Museum at South Kensington. Even soft jelly-fishes\r\nhave left their mark on certain rocks! At a place in Bavaria, called\r\nSolenhofen, there is a remarkably fine-grained limestone containing a\r\nmultitude of wonderful impressions. This stone is well known to\r\nlithographers, and is largely used in printing. On it the oldest known\r\nbird has left its skeleton and faithful impressions of its feathers.\r\n\r\nThe footprints of birds and reptiles are by no means uncommon. Such\r\nrecords are most valuable, for a great deal may be learned from even a\r\nfootprint as to the nature of the animal that made it (see p. 79).\r\n\r\nSince the greater number of animals described in this book are\r\nreptiles, quadrupeds, and other inhabitants of the land, and only a\r\nfew had their home in the sea, we must endeavour to try and understand\r\nhow their remains may have been preserved. Our object in writing this\r\nbook is to interpret their story, and, as it were, to bring them to\r\nlife again. Each one must be made to tell its own story, and that\r\nstory will be far from complete if we cannot form some idea of how it\r\nfound its way into a watery grave, and so was added to Nature's\r\nmuseum. For this purpose we must briefly explain to the reader how the\r\nrocks we see around us have been deposited; for these rocks are the\r\ntombs in which lost creations lie.\r\n\r\nGo into any ordinary quarry, where the men are at work, getting out\r\nthe stone in blocks to be used in building, or for use on the roads,\r\nor for some other purpose, and you will be pretty sure to notice at\r\nthe first glance that the rock is arranged as if it had been built up\r\nin layers. Now, this is true of all rocks that have been laid down by\r\nthe agency of water--as most of them have been. True, there are\r\nexceptions, but every rule has its exceptions. If you went into a\r\ngranite quarry at Aberdeen, or a basalt quarry near Edinburgh, you\r\nwould not see these layers; but such rocks as these do not contain\r\nfossils. They have been mainly formed by the action of great heat, and\r\nwere forced up to the surface of the earth by pressure from below. As\r\nthey slowly cooled, the mineral substances of which they were formed\r\ngradually crystallised; and it is this crystalline state, together\r\nwith the signs of movement, that tells us of their once heated state.\r\nSuch rocks are said to be of igneous origin (Lat. _ignis_, fire). But\r\nnearly all the other rocks were formed by the action of water--that\r\nis, under water,--and hence are known to geologists as aqueous\r\ndeposits (Lat. _aqua_, water). They may be considered as sediments\r\nthat slowly settled down in seas, lakes, or at the mouths of rivers.\r\nSuch deposits are in the course of being formed at the present day.\r\nAll round our coasts mud, sand, and gravel are being accumulated,\r\nlayer by layer. These materials are constantly being swept off the\r\nland by the action of rain and rivers, and carried down to the sea.\r\nPerhaps, when staying at the sea-side, you may have noticed, after\r\nrainy and rough weather, how the sea, for some distance from the\r\nshore, is discoloured with mud--especially at the mouth of a river.\r\nThe sand, being heavy, soon sinks down, and this is the reason why\r\nsand-bars so frequently block the entrance to rivers. Then again, the\r\nwaves of the sea beat against the sea-shore and undermine the cliffs,\r\nbringing down great fragments, which after a time are completely\r\nbroken up and worn down into rounded pebbles, or even fine sand and\r\nmud. It is very easy to see that in this way large quantities of sand,\r\ngravel, and mud are continually supplied to our seas. We can picture\r\nhow they will settle down; the sand not far from the shore, and the\r\nfine mud further out to sea. When the rough weather ceases, the river\r\nbecomes smaller and flows less rapidly, so that when the coarse\r\n_débris_ of the land has settled down to form layers, or strata, of\r\nsand and gravel, then the fine mud will begin to settle down also, and\r\nwill form a layer overlying them or further out. Thus we learn, from a\r\nlittle observation of what is now going on, how layers of sand and\r\nmud, such as we see in a quarry, were made thousands and thousands of\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of all the big rivers and small streams continually\r\nflowing into the sea, we shall begin to realise what a great work rain\r\nand rivers are doing in making the rocks of the future. If, at a later\r\nperiod, a slight upheaval of the sea-bed were to take place so as to\r\nbring it above water, and such is very likely, these materials would\r\nbe found neatly arranged in layers, and more or less hardened into\r\nsolid rock.\r\n\r\nThe reader may, perhaps, find it rather hard at first to realise that\r\nin this simple way vast deposits of rock are being formed in the seas\r\nof the present day, and that the finer material thus derived from a\r\ncontinent may be carried by ocean currents to great distances; but so\r\nit is. Over thousands of square miles of ocean, deposits are being\r\ngradually accumulated which will doubtless be some day turned into\r\nhard rock. Just to take one example: it has been found that in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, a distance of over two hundred miles from the mouth\r\nof that great river, the Amazon, the sea is discoloured by fine\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of rock frequently met with, the building up of\r\nwhich cannot be explained in the way we have pointed out; and that is\r\nlimestone. This rock has not been deposited as a sediment, like clays\r\nand sandstones, but geologists have good reasons for believing that it\r\nhas been gradually formed in the deeper and clearer parts of oceans by\r\nthe slow accumulation of marine shells, corals, and other creatures,\r\nwhose bodies are partly composed of carbonate of lime. This seems\r\nincredible at first, but the proofs are quite convincing.[3] As\r\nProfessor Huxley well remarked, there is as good evidence that chalk\r\nhas been built up by the accumulation of minute shells as that the\r\nPyramids were built by the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\n[3] See _The Autobiography of the Earth_, p. 223.\r\n\r\nThe science of geology reveals the startling fact that all the great\r\nseries of the stratified rocks, whose united thickness is over 80,000\r\nfeet, has been mainly accumulated under water, either by the action of\r\nthose powerful geological agents--rain and rivers--or through the\r\nagency of myriads of tiny marine animals. When we have grasped this\r\nidea, we have learned our first, and, perhaps, most useful lesson in\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply what has been above explained to the question\r\nimmediately before us. We want to know how the skeletons of animals\r\nliving on land came to be buried up under water, among the stratified\r\nrocks that are to be seen all over our country, and most of which were\r\nmade under the sea.\r\n\r\nWe can answer this question by going to Nature herself, in order to\r\nfind out what is actually going on at the present time, by inquiring\r\ninto the habits of land animals, their surroundings, and the accidents\r\nto which they are liable at sundry times and in divers manners. It is\r\nby this simple method of studying present actions that nearly all\r\ndifficult questions in geology may be solved. The leading principle of\r\nthe geologist is to interpret the past by the light of the present,\r\nor, in other words, to find out what happens now, in order to learn\r\nwhat took place ages ago; for it is clear that the world has been\r\ngoing on in the same way for at least as far back as geological\r\nhistory can take us. There has been a _uniformity_, or sameness, in\r\nNature's actions ever since living things first dwelt on the earth.\r\n\r\nJust as rivers are mainly responsible for bringing down to the sea the\r\nmaterials of which rocks are made, so these universal carrying agents\r\nare the means by which the bodies of many animals that live in the\r\nplains, over which they wander, are brought to their last\r\nresting-place. We have only to consult the records of great floods to\r\nsee what fearful havoc they sometimes make among living things, and\r\nhow the dead bodies are swept away.\r\n\r\nGreat floods rise rapidly, so that the herds of wild animals pasturing\r\non grassy plains are surprised by the rising waters, and, being unable\r\nto withstand the force of the water, are hurried along, and so\r\ndrowned. When dead they sink to the bottom, and may, in some cases, be\r\nburied up in the _débris_ hurried along by the river; but as a rule\r\ntheir bodies, being swollen by the gases formed by decomposing flesh,\r\nrise again to the surface, and consequently may be carried along for\r\nmany a mile, till they reach some lake, or perhaps right down to the\r\nmouth of a river, and so may be taken out to sea.\r\n\r\nOne or two examples will be given to show how important is the action\r\nof such floods. Sir Charles Lyell has given some striking\r\nillustrations of this. There was a memorable flood in the southern\r\nborders of Scotland on the 24th of June, 1794, which caused great\r\ndestruction in the region of the Solway Firth. Heavy rains had fallen,\r\nso that every stream entering the firth was greatly swollen. Not only\r\nsheep and cattle, but even herdsmen and shepherds were drowned. When\r\nthe flood had subsided, a fearful spectacle was seen on a large\r\nsand-bank, called \"the beds of Esk,\" where the waters meet; for on\r\nthis one bank were found collected together the bodies of 9 black\r\ncattle, 3 horses, 1840 sheep, 45 dogs, 180 hares, together with those\r\nof many smaller animals, also the corpses of two men and one woman.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, the celebrated traveller, says that when, at certain\r\nseasons, the large rivers of South America are swollen by heavy rains,\r\ngreat numbers of quadrupeds are drowned every year. Troops of wild\r\nhorses that graze in the \"savannahs,\" or grassy plains, are said to be\r\nswept away in thousands.\r\n\r\nIn Java, in the year 1699, Batavian River was flooded during an\r\nearthquake, and drowned buffaloes, tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, apes,\r\ncrocodiles, and other wild beasts, which were brought down to the\r\ncoast by the current.\r\n\r\nIn tropical countries, where very heavy rains fall at times, and\r\nrivers become rapidly swollen, floods are a great source of danger to\r\nman and beast. Probably the greater number of the bodies of animals\r\nthus drowned find their way into lakes, through which rivers flow, and\r\nnever reach the sea; and if the growth of sediment in such lakes goes\r\non fairly rapidly, their remains may be buried up, and so preserved.\r\nBut in many cases the bones fall one by one from the floating carcase,\r\nand so may in that way be scattered at random over the bottom of the\r\nlake, or the bed of a river at its mouth. In hot countries such\r\nbodies, on reaching the sea, run a great chance of being instantly\r\ndevoured by sharks, alligators, and other carnivorous animals. But\r\nduring very heavy floods, the waters that reach the sea are so heavily\r\nladen with mud, that these predaceous animals are obliged to retire to\r\nsome place where the waters are clear, so that at such times the dead\r\nbodies are more likely to escape their ravages; and, at the same time,\r\nthe mud with which the waters are charged falls so rapidly that it may\r\nquickly cover them up. We shall find further on that this explanation\r\nprobably applies to the case of the \"fish-lizards,\" whose remains are\r\nfound in the Lias formation (see p. 51).\r\n\r\nBut, for several reasons, sedimentary rocks formed in lakes are much\r\nmore likely to contain the remains of land animals, than those that\r\nwere formed in seas, and they are more likely to be in a complete\r\nstate of preservation. Within the last century, five or six small\r\nlakes in Scotland, which had been artificially drained, yielded the\r\nremains of several hundred skeletons of stags, oxen, boars, horses,\r\nsheep, dogs, hares, foxes, and wolves. There are two ways in which\r\nthese animals may have met with a watery grave. In the first place,\r\nthey may have got mired on going into the water, or in trying to land\r\non the other side, after swimming across. Any one who knows Scotch\r\nlakes will be familiar with the fact that their margins are often most\r\ntreacherous ground for bathers. The writer has more than once found it\r\nnecessary to be very cautious on wading into a lake while fishing, or\r\nin search of plants. Secondly, when such lakes are frozen over in\r\nwinter, the ice is often very treacherous in consequence of numerous\r\nsprings; and animals attempting to cross may be easily drowned. No\r\nremains of birds were discovered in these lakes, in spite of the fact\r\nthat, until drained, they were largely frequented by water-fowl. But\r\nit must be remembered that birds are protected by their powers of\r\nflight from perishing in such ways as other animals frequently do.\r\nAnd, even should they die on the water, their bodies are not likely to\r\nbe submerged; for, being light and feathery, they do not sink, but\r\ncontinue floating until the body rots away, or is devoured by some\r\ncreature such as a hungry pike. For these reasons the remains of birds\r\nare unfortunately very rare in the stratified rocks; and hence our\r\nknowledge of the bird life of former ages is slight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Imperfection of the Record.\r\n\r\nA very little consideration will serve to convince us that the record\r\nwhich Nature has kept in the stratified rocks is an incomplete one.\r\nThere are many reasons why it must be so. It is not to be expected\r\nthat these rocks should contain anything like a complete collection of\r\nthe remains of the various tribes of plants and animals that from time\r\nto time have flourished in seas, lakes, and estuaries, or on islands\r\nand continents of the world. In endeavouring to trace the course of\r\nlife on the globe at successive periods, we are continually met by\r\nwant of evidence due to the \"imperfection of the record\"--to use\r\nDarwin's phrase. The reasons are not far to seek. The preservation of\r\norganic remains, or even of impressions thereof, in sedimentary strata\r\nis, to some extent, a matter of chance. It is obvious that no wholly\r\nsoft creature, such as a jelly-fish, can be preserved; although on\r\nsome strata they have left impressions telling of their existence at a\r\nvery early period.\r\n\r\nA creature, to become fossilised, must possess some hard part, such as\r\na shell, _e.g._ an oyster (fossil oysters abound in some strata); or a\r\nhard chitinous covering, like that of the shrimp, or the trilobites of\r\nSilurian times; or a skeleton, such as all the backboned (vertebrate)\r\nanimals possess.\r\n\r\nBut even creatures that had skeletons have not by any means always\r\nbeen preserved. Bones, when left on the bottom of the sea, where no\r\nsediment, or very little, is forming, will decay, and so disappear\r\naltogether. As Darwin points out, we are in error in supposing that\r\nover the greater part of the ocean-bed of the present day sediment is\r\ndeposited fast enough to seal up organic remains before they can\r\ndecay. Over a large part of the ocean-bed such cannot be the case; and\r\nthis conclusion has, of late years, been confirmed by the observations\r\nmade during the fruitful voyage of H.M.S. _Challenger_ in the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\nAgain, even in shallower parts of the old seas, where sand or mud was\r\nonce deposited, fossilisation was somewhat accidental; for some\r\nmaterials, being porous, allow of the percolation of water, and in\r\nthis way shells, bones, etc., have been dissolved and lost. Thus\r\nsandstone strata are always barren in fossils compared to shales and\r\nlimestones, which are much less pervious. To take examples from our\r\nown country, the New Red Sandstone of the south-west of England, the\r\nmidland counties, Cheshire, and other parts contains very few fossils\r\nindeed, while the clays and limestones of the succeeding Lias period\r\nabound in organic remains of all sorts. Even insects have left\r\ndelicate impressions of their wings and bodies! while shells, corals,\r\nencrinites, fish-teeth, and bones of saurians are found in great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nAgain, it must be borne in mind that the series of stratified rocks\r\nknown to geologists is not complete or unbroken. They have been well\r\ncompared to the leaves of a book on history, of which whole chapters\r\nand many separate pages have been torn out. These gaps, or \"breaks,\"\r\nare due to what is called \"denudation;\" that is to say, a great many\r\nrocks, after having been slowly deposited in water, have been upraised\r\nto form dry land, and then, being subjected for ages to the destroying\r\naction of \"rain and rivers,\" or the waves of the sea, have been\r\nlargely destroyed. Such rocks, in the language of geology, have been\r\n\"denuded;\" that is, stripped off, so that the underlying rocks are\r\nleft bare.\r\n\r\nBut the process of rock-making does not go on continuously in any one\r\narea. Sedimentary strata have been formed in slowly sinking areas.\r\nBut, if subsidence ceases, and the downward movement becomes an upward\r\none, then the bed of the sea is converted into dry land, and the\r\ngeological record is broken; for aqueous strata do not form on dry\r\nland. Blown sands and terrestrial lava-flows are exceptions; but such\r\naccumulations are very small and insignificant, and may therefore be\r\nneglected, especially as they contain no fossils.\r\n\r\nIn this way, as well as by the process of \"denudation\" already alluded\r\nto, breaks occur; and these breaks often represent long intervals of\r\ntime. There are several such gaps in the British series of stratified\r\nrocks; and it is partly by means of these breaks, during which\r\nimportant geographical and other changes took place, that sedimentary\r\nrocks have been classified and arranged in groups representing\r\ngeological periods. Thus, the Cainozoic, or Tertiary, rocks of the\r\nThames' basin are separated by a long \"break\" from those of the\r\npreceding Cretaceous period. During that interval great changes in\r\nanimal life took place, whereby, in the course of evolution, new types\r\nappeared on the scene. (See Table of Strata, Appendix I.)\r\n\r\nAnother cause interfering with the record is to be found in those\r\nimportant internal changes that have taken place in stratified\r\nrocks--often over large areas--which may be ascribed to the influence\r\nof heat and pressure combined. This process of change, whereby soft\r\ndeposits have been altered or \"metamorphosed\" into hard crystalline\r\nrocks, is known as \"metamorphism.\" Metamorphic rocks have lost not\r\nonly their original structure and appearance, but also their included\r\norganic remains, or fossils. Thus, when a soft limestone has been\r\nconverted by these means into crystalline statuary marble, any fossils\r\nit may once have contained have been destroyed. It is true that this\r\napplies more to older and lower deposits,--for the lowest are the\r\noldest--but there can be no doubt that valuable records of the forms\r\nof life which peopled the world in former periods have been lost by\r\nthis means.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, it must ever be borne in mind that, as yet, our knowledge\r\nof the stratified rocks of the earth's crust is very limited. In\r\ncourse of time, no doubt, this deficiency will be to a great extent\r\nmade good; but it will take a long time. Already, within the last\r\nthirty years, the labours of zealous geologists in the colonies and in\r\nvarious countries have added largely to our knowledge of the\r\ngeological record. Still, only a small portion of the earth's surface\r\nhas at present been explored; and doubtless one may look forward to\r\nfuture discoveries of extinct forms of animal and plant life as\r\nwonderful and strange as those that have been of late years unearthed\r\nin the \"far West,\" in Africa, and India. The Siwalik Hills of Northern\r\nIndia offer a rich harvest of fossils to future explorers. Already,\r\none remarkable and large horned quadruped has come from this region;\r\nand it is known that other valuable treasures are sealed up within\r\nthese hills, only awaiting the \"open sesame\" of some enterprising\r\nexplorer to bring them to light.\r\n\r\nAs previously pointed out, deposits formed in lakes are the most\r\npromising field for geologists in search of the remains of old\r\nterrestrial quadrupeds and reptiles; but, unfortunately, such deposits\r\nare rare.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be regretted that the carelessness and indifference\r\nof ignorant workmen in quarries, clay-pits, and railway cuttings have\r\nsometimes been the cause of valuable fossils being broken up, and so\r\nlost for ever. Unless they are accustomed to the visits of\r\nfossil-collectors who will pay them liberally for their finds, the men\r\nwill not take the trouble to preserve any bones they may come across\r\nin the course of their work. (An example of this negligence will be\r\nfound on p. 95.) But when once they realise that such finds have what\r\npolitical economists call an \"exchange value,\" or, in other words, can\r\nbe turned into money, it is astonishing what zealous guardians of\r\nNature's treasures they become! For this reason collectors often find\r\nwhat Professor Bonney calls the \"silver hammer\"--in other words,\r\ncash--more effective than the iron implement they carry with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSEA-SCORPIONS.\r\n\r\n     \"And some rin up the hill and down dale, knapping the chucky\r\n     stanes to pieces wi' hammers like sae many road-makers run\r\n     daft. They say 'tis to see how the warld was made.\"--_St.\r\n     Ronan's Well._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first group of monsters is taken from a tribe of armed warriors\r\nthat lived in the seas of a very ancient period in the world's\r\nhistory. Like the crabs and lobsters inhabiting the coasts of Britain,\r\nthey possessed a coat of armour, and jointed bodies, supplied with\r\nlimbs for crawling, swimming, or seizing their prey. They were giants\r\nin their day, far eclipsing in size any of their relations that have\r\nlived on to the present time. Some of them, such as the Pterygotus\r\n(Fig. 1, p. 26), attained a length of nearly six feet. They belonged\r\nto the humbler ranks of life, and, if now living, would without doubt\r\nbe assigned, by fishmongers ignorant of natural history, to that vague\r\ncategory of \"shell-fish\" in which they include crabs, lobsters,\r\nmussels, etc.\r\n\r\nThese lobster-like creatures, though claiming no relationship with the\r\nhigher ranks of animals, may well engage our attention, not only for\r\ntheir great size, but also for their strange build.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.\r\n\r\nSEA-SCORPIONS.\r\n\r\n_Pterygotus anglicus._ _Eurypterus._ _Stylonurus._\r\n\r\nLength 6 feet.]\r\n\r\nThere are no living creatures quite like them. Certainly they are not\r\ntrue lobsters, and yet we may consider them to be first or second\r\ncousins of those ten-footed crustaceans[4] of the present\r\nday--lobsters, crabs, and shrimps, so welcome on the tables of both\r\nrich and poor. Some naturalists say that their nearest relations at\r\nthe present day are the king-crabs inhabiting the China seas and the\r\neast coast of North America; and there certainly are some points of\r\nresemblance between them. Others say that they are related to\r\nscorpions, and for this reason we call them Sea-scorpions. (See Plate\r\nI.)\r\n\r\n[4] Crustaceans are a class of jointed creatures (articulate animals),\r\npossessing a hard shell or crust (Lat. _crusta_), which they cast\r\nperiodically. They all breathe by gills.\r\n\r\nThe first feature we notice in these creatures is the way in which\r\ntheir bodies and limbs are divided into rings or joints. This fact\r\ntells us that they belong to that great division of animals called\r\n\"Articulates,\" of which crabs, lobsters, spiders, centipedes, and\r\ninsects are examples. The celebrated Linnæus called them _all_\r\ninsects, because their bodies are in this way cut into divisions.[5]\r\nBut this arrangement has since been abandoned. However, they are all\r\nbuilt upon this simple plan, their bodies being like a series of\r\nrings, to which are attached paired appendages or limbs, also composed\r\nof rings, some longer and some shorter. Now, there must be something\r\nvery fitting and appropriate in this arrangement, for the creatures\r\nthat are thus built up are far more numerous than any other group of\r\nanimals. They must be particularly well qualified to fight the battle\r\nof life; for like a victorious army they have taken the world by\r\nstorm, and still remain in possession. We find them everywhere--in\r\nseas, rivers, and lakes; in fields and forests; in the soil, and in\r\nall sorts of nooks and crannies; in the air, and even upon or inside\r\nthe bodies of other animals. Some of them, such as ants, bees, and\r\nwasps, show an intelligence that is simply marvellous, and have\r\nacquired social habits which excite our admiration.\r\n\r\n[5] Lat. _in_, into, and _secta_, cut.\r\n\r\nArticulate animals are a very ancient race, as well as a flourishing\r\none, for the oldest rocks containing undoubted fossils--namely,\r\ncertain slates found in Wales and the Lake District--tell us of a time\r\nwhen shallow seas swarmed with little articulate animals known as\r\n_trilobites_. They were in appearance something like wood-lice of the\r\npresent day; and the record of the rocks tells us plainly that\r\ncreatures built upon this plan have flourished ever since. We mention\r\nthis because they are related to the king-crabs of the present day,\r\nand therefore to the huge old-fashioned sea-scorpions we are now\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--_Pterygotus anglicus._ (After Woodward.)\r\n\r\n1. Upper side. 2. Under side.]\r\n\r\nThe best-known and largest of these creatures is represented in Fig.\r\n1. It has received the name _Pterygotus_ (or wing-eared) from certain\r\nfanciful resemblances pointed out by the quarrymen. It was first\r\ndiscovered, along with others of its kind, by Hugh Miller, at Carmylie\r\nin Forfarshire, in a certain part of the Old Red Sandstone (see Table\r\nof Strata, Appendix I.) known as the Arbroath paving-stone. The\r\nquarrymen, in the course of their work, came upon and dug out large\r\npieces of the fossilised remains of this creature. Its hard coat of\r\njointed armour bore on its surface curious wavy markings that\r\nsuggested to their minds the sculptured feathers on the wings of\r\ncherubs--of all subjects of the chisel the most common. Hence they\r\nchristened these remains \"Seraphim.\" They did not succeed in getting\r\ncomplete specimens that could be pieced together; and the part to\r\nwhich this fanciful name was given turned out to be part of the under\r\nside below the mouth. It was composed of several large plates, two of\r\nwhich are not unlike the wings of a cherub in shape. Hugh Miller says\r\nin his classic work, _The Old Red Sandstone_--\"the form altogether,\r\nfrom its wing-like appearance, its feathery markings, and its angular\r\npoints, will suggest to the reader the origin of the name given it by\r\nForfarshire workmen.\"\r\n\r\nA correct restoration, in proportion to the fragments found in the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone, would give a creature measuring nearly six\r\nfeet in length, and more than a foot across. _Pterygotus anglicus_ may\r\ntherefore be justly considered a monster crustacean.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Cuvier, who, in the eighteenth century founded the\r\nscience of comparative anatomy (see p. 5), astonished the scientific\r\nworld by his bold interpretations of fossil bones. From a few broken\r\nfragments of bone he could restore the skeleton of an entire animal,\r\nand determine its habits and mode of living. When other wise men were\r\nunable to read the writing of Nature on the walls of her museum--in\r\nthe shape of fossil bones--he came forward, like a second Daniel, to\r\ninterpret the signs, and so instructed us how to restore the world's\r\nlost creations. Hugh Miller submitted the fragments found at\r\nBalruddery to the celebrated naturalist Agassiz, a pupil of Cuvier,\r\nwho had written a famous work on fossil fishes; and he says that he\r\nwas much struck with the skill displayed by him in piecing together\r\nthe fragments of the huge Pterygotus. \"Agassiz glanced over the\r\ncollection. One specimen especially caught his attention--an elegantly\r\nsymmetrical one. His eye brightened as he contemplated it. 'I will\r\ntell you,' he said, turning to the company--'I will tell you what\r\nthese are--the remains of a huge lobster.' He arranged the specimens\r\nin the group before him with as much ease as I have seen a young girl\r\narranging the pieces of ivory in an Indian puzzle. There is a homage\r\ndue to supereminent genius, which Nature spontaneously pays when there\r\nare no low feelings of jealousy or envy to interfere with her\r\noperations; and the reader may well believe that it was willingly\r\nrendered on this occasion to the genius of Agassiz.\" Agassiz himself,\r\nprevious to this, had considered such fragments as he had seen to be\r\nthe remains of fishes. As we have said before, this creature was _not_\r\na true lobster; but Agassiz, when he expressed the opinion just\r\nquoted, was not far off the mark, and did great service in showing it\r\nto be a crustacean. There were no lobsters or scorpions at that early\r\nperiod of the world's history, and this creature, with its long\r\n\"jaw-feet\" and powerful tail, was a near approach to a king-crab on\r\nthe one hand and scorpion on the other. If living now, it would no\r\ndoubt command a high price at Billingsgate; but, then, it would be a\r\ndangerous thing to handle when alive, and might be more troublesome to\r\ncatch than our crabs or lobsters.\r\n\r\nThe front part of its body was entirely enveloped in a kind of shield,\r\ncalled a carapace, bearing near the centre minute eyes, which probably\r\nwere useless, and at the corners two large compound eyes, made up of\r\nnumerous little lenses, such as we see in the eye of a dragon-fly.\r\nThis is clearly proved by certain well-preserved specimens. There are\r\nfive pairs of appendages, all attached under or near the head. Behind\r\nthe head follow thirteen rings, or segments, the last of which forms\r\nthe tail, two at least of these bore gills for breathing. All but two\r\nof them, below the mouth, must have been beautifully articulated, so\r\nas to allow them to move freely, as we see in the lobster of the\r\npresent day. But look at that lowest and largest pair of appendages,\r\nthe end joints of which are flattened out, and you will see that they\r\nmust have been a powerful oar-like apparatus for swimming forwards.\r\nWe can fancy this creature propelling itself much in the same way as a\r\n\"water-beetle\" rows itself through the water in a pond. In all other\r\ncrustaceans the antennæ are used for feeling about, but in the\r\nPterygotus they are used as claws for seizing the prey.\r\n\r\nIn general external appearance, this huge Pterygotus greatly reminds\r\nus of a tiny fresh-water crustacean, known as Cyclops--because it has\r\nonly one eye, like the giant in Homer's _Odyssey_. This little\r\ncreature, which is only 1/16 inch in length, is an inhabitant of\r\nponds. From its large eyes, powerful oar-like limbs, or appendages,\r\nand from the general form of its body, Dr. Henry Woodward (the author\r\nof a learned monograph on these creatures) concludes that the\r\nPterygotus was a very active animal; and the reader will easily gather\r\nfrom its pair of antennæ, converted at their extremities into nippers,\r\nand from the nature of its \"jaw-feet,\" that the creature was a hungry\r\nand predaceous monster, seizing everything eatable that came in its\r\nway. The whole family to which it belongs--including Pterygotus,\r\nEurypterus, Slimonia, Stylonurus, and others--seems to have been\r\nfitted for rather rapid motion, if we may judge from the long tapering\r\nand well-articulated body. In two forms (Pterygotus and Slimonia) the\r\ntail-flap probably served both as a powerful propeller, and as a\r\nrudder for directing the creature's course; but others, such as\r\nEurypterus and Stylonurus, had long sword-like tails, which may have\r\nassisted them to burrow into the sand, in the same way that king-crabs\r\ndo. Eurypterus remipes is shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that our sea-scorpions are related to the\r\nking-crabs. Now, this creature, it is well known, burrows into the mud\r\nand sand at the bottom of the sea. This it does by shoving its broad\r\nsharp-edged head-shield downwards, working rapidly at the same time\r\nwith its hinder feet, or appendages, and by pushing with the long\r\nspike that forms a kind of tail. It will thus sink deeper and deeper\r\nuntil nothing can be seen of its body, and only the eyes peep out of\r\nthe mud. It will crawl and wander about by night, but remains hidden\r\nby day. Some of them are of large size, and occasionally measure two\r\nfeet in length. They possess six pairs of well-formed feet, the joints\r\nof which, near the body, are armed with teeth and spines, and serve\r\nthe purpose of jaws, being used to masticate the food and force it\r\ninto the mouth, which is situated between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--_Silurian merostomata._\r\n\r\n1. _Stylonurus._ 2. _Eurypterus._ (After Woodward.)]\r\n\r\nNow, this fact is of great importance; for it helps us to understand\r\nthe use of the four pairs of \"jaw-feet\" in our Sea-scorpions. What\r\ncurious animals they must have been, using the same limbs for walking,\r\nholding their prey, and eating! Look at the broad plates at the base\r\nof the oar-like limbs, or appendages, with their tooth-like edges.\r\nThese are the plates found by Hugh Miller's quarrymen, and compared by\r\nthem to the wings of seraphim. You will easily perceive that by a\r\nbackward and forward movement, they would perform the office of teeth\r\nand jaws, while the long antennæ with their nippers--helped by the\r\nother and smaller appendages--held the unfortunate victim in a\r\nrelentless grasp. And even these smaller limbs, you will see from the\r\nfigure, had their first joints, near the mouth, provided with toothed\r\nedges like a saw.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the habits of Sea-scorpions, it would not be altogether\r\nsafe to conclude that, because in so many ways they resembled\r\nking-crabs, they therefore had the same habit of burrowing into the\r\nsoft muddy or sandy bed of the sea, as some authorities have supposed.\r\nSeeing that there is a difference of opinion on this subject, the\r\nauthor consulted Dr. Woodward on the question, and he said he thought\r\nit unlikely, seeing that, in some of them, such as the Pterygotus, the\r\neyes are placed on the margin of the head-shield; for it would hardly\r\ncare to rub its eyes with sand. Whether it chose at times to bury its\r\nlong body in the sand by a process of wriggling backwards, as certain\r\nmodern crustaceans do, we may consider to be an open question.\r\n\r\nIf only Sea-scorpions had not unfortunately died out, how interesting\r\nit would be to watch them alive, and to see exactly what use they\r\nwould make of their long bodies, tail-flaps, and tail-spikes! Were\r\nthey nocturnal in their habits, wandering about by night, and taking\r\ntheir rest by day? Such questions, we fear, can never be answered. But\r\ntheir large eyes would have been able to collect a great deal of light\r\nwhen the moon and stars feebly illumined the shallower waters of the\r\nseas of Old Red Sandstone times; and so there is nothing to contradict\r\nthe idea.\r\n\r\nNow, it is an interesting fact that young crabs, soon after they are\r\nhatched, have long bodies somewhat similar to those of our\r\nSea-scorpions, with a head-shield under which are their jaw-feet, and\r\nthen a number of free body-rings without any appendages. These end in\r\na spiked tail. As the crab grows older, he ceases to be a\r\nfree-swimming animal--for which kind of life his long body is well\r\nsuited,--tucks up his long tail, and takes to crawling instead. Thus\r\nhis body is rendered more compact and handy for the life he is going\r\nto lead. Lobsters, on the other hand, can swim gently forwards, or\r\ndart rapidly backwards. Thus we see that the ten-footed crustaceans of\r\nthe present day are divided into two groups--the long-tailed and\r\nfree-swimming forms, such as lobsters, shrimps, and cray-fishes; and\r\nthe short-tailed crawling forms, namely, the crabs. Now, in the same\r\nway, Pterygotus and its allies were long-tailed forms, while the\r\nking-crabs are short-tailed forms. So were the trilobites of old.\r\nHence we learn that, ages and ages ago, before the days of crabs and\r\nlobsters, there were long-tailed and short-tailed forms of\r\ncrustaceans, just as there are now, only they did not possess true\r\nwalking legs. They belonged to quite a different order, called\r\n\"thigh-mouthed\" crustaceans, Merostomata, because their legs are all\r\nplaced near the mouth; and, as we have already learned, were used for\r\nfeeding as well as for purposes of locomotion.\r\n\r\nNow, one of the many points of interest in Pterygotus and its allies\r\nis that they somewhat resemble the crab in its young or larval state.\r\nTo a modern naturalist, this fact is important as showing that\r\ncrustacean forms of life have advanced since the days of the\r\nsea-scorpions.\r\n\r\nTheir resemblance to land-scorpions is so close that, if it were not\r\nfor the important fact that scorpions breathe _air_ instead of\r\n_water_, and for this purpose are provided with air-tubes (or trachea)\r\nsuch as all insects have, they would certainly be removed bodily out\r\nof the crustacean class, and put into that in which scorpions and\r\nspiders are placed, viz. the Arachnida. But, in spite of this\r\nimportant difference, there are some naturalists in favour of such a\r\nchange. It will thus be seen that our name Sea-scorpions is quite\r\npermissible.\r\n\r\nHugh Miller described some curious little round bodies found with the\r\nremains of the Pterygotus, which it was thought were the eggs of these\r\ncreatures!\r\n\r\nFinally, these extinct crustaceans flourished in those ages of the\r\nworld's history known as the Silurian and the Old Red Sandstone\r\nperiods. As far as we know, they did not survive beyond the succeeding\r\nperiod, known as the Carboniferous.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] The student should consult Dr. Henry Woodward's valuable\r\n_Monograph of the British Merostomata_ (Palæontographical Society), to\r\nwhich the writer is much indebted. With regard to the representation\r\nof _Pterygotus anglicus_ in Plate I., it has been pointed out by Dr.\r\nWoodward that the creature was unable to bend its body into such a\r\nposition as is shown there. As in a modern lobster, or shrimp, there\r\nwere certain overlapping plates in the rings, or segments, of the\r\nbody, which prevented movement from side to side, and only allowed of\r\na vertical movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FISH-LIZARDS.\r\n\r\n     \"Berossus, the Chaldæan saith: A time was when the universe\r\n     was darkness and water, wherein certain animals of frightful\r\n     and compound forms were generated. There were serpents and\r\n     other creatures with the mixed shapes of one another, of\r\n     which pictures are kept in the temple of Belus at\r\n     Babylon.\"--_The Archaic Genesis._\r\n\r\n\r\nVisitors to Sydenham, who have wandered about the spacious gardens so\r\nskilfully laid out by the late Sir Joseph Paxton, will be familiar\r\nwith the great models of extinct animals on the \"geological island.\"\r\nThese were designed and executed by that clever artist, Mr. Waterhouse\r\nHawkins, who made praiseworthy efforts to picture to our eyes some of\r\nthe world's lost creations, as restored by the genius of Sir Richard\r\nOwen and other famous naturalists. His drawings of extinct animals may\r\nyet be seen hanging on the walls of some of our provincial museums;\r\nand doubtless others still linger among the natural history\r\ncollections of schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nLazily basking in the sun, when it condescends to shine, and resting\r\nhis clumsy carcase on the ground that forms the shore near the said\r\ngeological island at Sydenham, may be seen the old fish-lizard, or\r\nIchthyosaurus, that forms the subject of the present chapter. He looks\r\nawkward on land, as if longing to get into his native element once\r\nmore, and cleave its waters with his powerful tail-fin. His \"flippers\"\r\nseem too weak to enable him to crawl on land. Moreover, the most\r\nrecent discoveries of Dr. Fraas lead us to conclude that the\r\nIchthyosaur never ventured to leave the \"briny ocean\" to bask upon the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThis great uncouth beast presents some curious anomalies in his\r\nconstitution, being planned on different lines to anything now living,\r\nand presenting, as so many other extinct animals do, a mixture, or\r\nfusion, of types that greatly puzzled the learned men of the time when\r\nhis remains were first brought to light, after their long entombment\r\nin the Lias rocks forming the cliffs on the coast of Dorset. Some have\r\nchristened him a \"sea-dragon,\" and such indeed he may be considered.\r\nBut the name Ichthyosaurus, given above, has received the sanction of\r\nhigh authority, and, moreover, serves to remind us of the fact that,\r\nalthough in many respects a lizard, he yet retains in his bony\r\nframework the traces of a remote fishy ancestry. So we will call him a\r\nfish-lizard.\r\n\r\nWe remember in our young days the amiable endeavours of Mr. \"Peter\r\nParley\" to introduce us to the wonders of creation; and his account of\r\nthe Ichthyosaurus particularly impressed itself on our youthful\r\nimagination. How surprised that inestimable instructor of youth would\r\nbe could he now see the still more wonderful remains that have been\r\nbrought to light from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America!\r\n\r\nThe curious quotation given at the head of the present chapter refers\r\nto a widespread belief, prevalent among the highly civilised nations\r\nof antiquity, that the world was once inhabited by dragons, or other\r\nmonsters \"of mixed shape\" and characters. To the student of ancient\r\nhistory traces of this curious belief will be familiar. Sir Charles\r\nLyell refers to such a belief when he says, in his _Principles of\r\nGeology_, \"The Egyptians, it is true, had taught, and the Stoics had\r\nrepeated, that the earth had once given birth to some monstrous\r\nanimals that existed no longer.\" It may be surprising to some, but it\r\nis undoubtedly the fact, that modern scientific truths were partly\r\nanticipated by the civilised nations of long ago. Take the ideas of\r\nthe ancients as interpreted from the records of Egypt, Chaldæa,\r\nIndia, and China; and you will find that our discoveries in geology,\r\nastronomy, and ethnology go far to prove that the traditions of these\r\nancient peoples, however derived, after making due allowance for\r\nOriental allegory and poetic hyperbole, are not far from the truth. To\r\nthe Babylonian tradition of the monstrous forms of life at first\r\ncreated we have already alluded; but in other fields of discovery we\r\nfind the same foreshadowing of discoveries made in our own day. Take\r\nthe vast cycles of Egyptian tradition, wherein the stars returned to\r\ntheir places after a circle of constant change, only to start again on\r\ntheir unwearied round; the atomic theory of Lucretius, now expanded\r\nand incorporated into modern chemistry; or the philosopher's pregnant\r\nsaying--_Omne vivum ex ovo_ (\"Every living thing comes from an egg\").\r\nThese and other examples might be cited to show how true the old\r\nsaying is, \"There is nothing new under the sun.\" In the writings of\r\nancient authors may be found singular notices of bones and skeletons\r\nfound in \"the bowels of the earth,\" which are referred to an imaginary\r\nera of long ago, when giants of huge dimensions walked this earth. One\r\nis inclined sometimes to wonder whether the old fables of griffins and\r\nhorrid dragons may not be to some extent based upon the occasional\r\ndiscovery, in former times, of fossil bones, such as evidently\r\nbelonged to animals the like of which are not to be seen nowadays.\r\n(See chaps. xiii. and xiv.)\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Cuvier, in his day, considered the fish-lizard to be\r\none of the most heteroclite and monstrous animals ever discovered. He\r\nsaid of this creature that it possessed the snout of a dolphin, the\r\nteeth of a crocodile, the head and breast-bone of a lizard, the\r\npaddles of a whale or dolphin, and the vertebræ of a fish! No wonder\r\nthat naturalists and palæontologists, whose realm is the natural\r\nhistory of the past, were obliged to make a new division, or order, of\r\nreptiles to accommodate the fish-lizard. It is obvious that a creature\r\nwith such very \"mixed\" relationships would be out of place in any of\r\nthe four orders into which living reptiles, as represented by turtles,\r\nsnakes, lizards, and crocodiles are divided. Here is what Professor\r\nBlackie says of the Ichthyosaurus--\r\n\r\n    \"Behold, a strange monster our wonder engages!\r\n        If dolphin or lizard your wit may defy.\r\n    Some thirty feet long, on the shore of Lyme-Regis,\r\n        With a saw for a jaw, and a big staring eye.\r\n    A fish or a lizard? An ichthyosaurus,\r\n        With a big goggle eye, and a very small brain,\r\n    And paddles like mill-wheels in chattering chorus,\r\n        Smiting tremendous the dread-sounding main.\"\r\n\r\nA glance at our restoration, Plate II., will show that the fish-lizard\r\nwas a powerful monster, well endowed with the means of propelling\r\nitself rapidly through the water as it sought its living prey, to\r\nseize it within those cruel jaws. The long and powerful tail was its\r\nchief organ of propulsion; but the paddles would also be useful for\r\nthis purpose, as well as for guiding its course. The pointed head and\r\ngenerally tapering body suggests a capability of rapid movement\r\nthrough the water; and since we know for certain that it fed on\r\nfishes, this conclusion is confirmed, for fishes are not easily caught\r\nnow, and most probably were not easily caught ages ago.\r\n\r\nThe personal history of the fish-lizard, merely as a fossil or\r\n\"remain,\" is interesting; so much so, that we may perhaps be allowed\r\nto relate the circumstances of his _début_ before the scientific\r\nworld, in the days of the ever-illustrious Cuvier, to whom we have\r\nalready alluded. But England had its share of illustrious men, too,\r\nthough lesser lights compared to the founder of comparative\r\nanatomy,--such as Sir Richard Owen, on whom the mantle of his friend\r\nCuvier has fallen; Conybeare, De la Beche, and Dean Buckland.\r\n\r\nThese scientific men, aided by the untiring labours of many\r\nenthusiastic collectors of organic remains, have been the means of\r\nsolving the riddle of the fish-lizard, and of introducing him to the\r\npublic. By this time there is, perhaps, no creature among the host of\r\nAntediluvian types better known than this reptile.\r\n\r\nThe remains of fish-lizards have attracted the attention of collectors\r\nand describers of fossils for nearly two centuries past. The vertebræ,\r\nor \"cup-bones,\" as they are often called, of which the spinal column\r\nwas composed, were figured by Scheüchzer, in an old work entitled\r\n_Querelæ Piscium_; and, at that time, they were supposed to be the\r\nvertebræ of fishes. In the year 1814 Sir Everard Home described the\r\nfossil remains of this creature, in a paper read before the Royal\r\nSociety, and published in their _Philosophical Transactions_. This\r\nfossil was first discovered in the Lias strata of the Dorsetshire\r\ncoast. Other papers followed till the year 1820. We are chiefly\r\nindebted to De la Beche and Conybeare for pointing out and\r\nillustrating the nature of the fish-lizard; and that at a time when\r\nthe materials for so doing were far more scanty than they are now. Mr.\r\nCharles König, Mr. Thomas Hawkins, Dean Buckland, Sir Philip Egerton,\r\nand Professor Owen have all helped to throw light on the structure and\r\nhabits of these old tyrants of the seas of that age, which is known as\r\nthe Jurassic period. They lived on, however, to the succeeding or\r\nCretaceous period, during which our English chalk was forming; but the\r\nLiassic age was the one in which they flourished most abundantly, and\r\ndeveloped the greatest variety.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1814 a few bones were found on the Dorsetshire coast\r\nbetween Charmouth and Lyme-Regis, and added to the collection of\r\nBullock. They came from the Lias cliffs, undermined by the encroaching\r\nsea. Sir Everard's attention being attracted to them, he published the\r\nnotices already referred to. The analogy of some of the bones to those\r\nof a crocodile, induced Mr. König, of the British Museum, to believe\r\nthe animal to have been a saurian, or lizard; but the vertebræ, and\r\nalso the position of certain openings in the skull, indicated some\r\nremote affinity with fishes, but this must not be pressed too far. The\r\nchoice of a name, therefore, involved much difficulty; and at length\r\nhe decided to call it the _Ichthyosaurus_, or fish-lizard. Mr.\r\nJohnson, of Bristol, who had collected for many years in that\r\nneighbourhood, found out some valuable particulars about these\r\nremains. The conclusions of Dean Buckland, then Professor of Geology\r\nat Oxford, led Sir Everard to abandon many of his former conclusions.\r\nThe labours of the learned men of the day were greatly assisted by the\r\nexertions of Miss Anning, an enthusiastic collector of fossils. This\r\nlady, devoting herself to science, explored the frowning and\r\nprecipitous cliffs in the neighbourhood of Lyme-Regis, when the\r\nfurious spring-tide combined with the tempest to overthrow them, and\r\nrescued from destruction by the sea, sometimes at the peril of her\r\nlife, the few specimens which originated all the facts and\r\nspeculations of those persons whose names will ever be remembered with\r\ngratitude by geologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--_Ichthyosaurus intermedius._]\r\n\r\nProbably our readers are already more or less familiar with the\r\ndrawings of the fossilised remains of Ichthyosauri to be seen in\r\nalmost every text-book of geology. (Fig. 3 is from Owen's _British\r\nFossil Reptiles_.) But we recommend all who take an interest in the\r\nworld's lost creations to pay a visit to the great Natural History\r\nMuseum, at South Kensington. The fossil reptile gallery contains a\r\nmagnificent series of Ichthyosauri, about thirty in number. Of these a\r\nlarge number were obtained through the exertions of the late Mr. T.\r\nHawkins, a Somersetshire gentleman, who was a most ardent collector of\r\nfossil reptiles, and who devoted himself with great enthusiasm and\r\nunsparing energy to the acquisition of a truly splendid collection of\r\nthese most interesting relics of the past. Nearly sixty years ago he\r\narranged for the purchase of his treasures by the authorities of the\r\nBritish Museum, and thus his collection became the property of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHis specimens were figured and described by him in two large folio\r\nvolumes. The first was published in 1834, under the title, _Memoirs of\r\nthe Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri_; his second, with the same plates,\r\nin 1842, under the quaint title of _The Book of the Great\r\nSea-Dragons_. The large lithographic drawings of his fine specimens\r\nwere beautifully executed by Scharf and O'Neil. The plates are the\r\nonly really valuable part of these two curious and ill-written books.\r\nHis descriptions are not of much value, and his pages are encumbered\r\nwith a vast amount of extraneous matter. The author is immensely proud\r\nof his collection, and his vanity is conspicuous throughout. Instead\r\nof confining himself to descriptions of what he found, and how he\r\nfound them, he continually wanders into all sorts of subjects that\r\nare, to say the least, irrelevant. In one place he introduces ancient\r\nhistory and mythology; in another, Old Testament chronology; in\r\nanother, the unbelieving spirit of the age; and here and there\r\nindulges in vague unphilosophical speculations. Altogether his two\r\nvolumes are a curious mixture of bigotry, conceit, and unrestrained\r\nfancy, and they afforded to the present writer no small amusement. One\r\nrises from the perusal of such men's writings with a strong sense of\r\nthe contrast between the humble and patient spirit in which our great\r\nmen of to-day, such as Professor Owen, study nature and record their\r\nobservations, and the vague, conceited outpourings of some\r\nold-fashioned writers.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins tells us that his youthful attention was directed to the\r\nLias quarries, near Edgarly, in Somersetshire, in consequence of some\r\nstrange reports. It was said that the bones of giants and infants had,\r\nat distant intervals, been found in them. These quarries he visited,\r\nand, by offers of generous payment, induced the workmen to keep for\r\nhim all the remains they might find. In this way he finally obtained\r\nthe co-operation of all the quarrymen in the county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.\r\n\r\nFISH-LIZARDS.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyosaurus communis._ _Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris._\r\n\r\nLength about 22 feet. Fishes, _Dapedius_, etc. A smaller species.]\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins thus expresses his delight on obtaining an Ichthyosaurus\r\nwhich was pointed out to him by Miss Anning, near the church at\r\nLyme-Regis, in the year 1832: \"Who can describe my transport at the\r\nsight of the colossus? My eyes the first which beheld it! Who shall\r\never see them lit up with the same unmitigated enthusiasm again? And I\r\nverily believe that the uncultivated bosoms of the working men were\r\nseized with the same contagious feeling; for they and the surrounding\r\nspectators waved their hats to an 'Hurra!' that made hill and mossy\r\ndell echoing ring.\"\r\n\r\nThis specimen, however, got sadly broken in its fall from the cliff;\r\nbut in time he put all the pieces together again. Speaking of his own\r\ncollection, he says, \"This stupendous treasure was gathered by me from\r\nevery part of England; arranged, and its multifarious features\r\nelaborated from the hard limestone by my own hands. A tyro in\r\ncollecting at the age of twelve years, I then boasted of all the\r\nantiquities that were come-at-able in my neighbourhood, but, finding\r\nthat everybody beat my cabinet of coins, I addressed myself to\r\nworm-eaten books, and last to fossils.\" Before he was twenty years of\r\nage he had obtained a very fine collection of organic remains.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he complains of the Philistine dulness and stupidity of\r\nquarrymen, who often, in their ignorance, break up finds of almost\r\npriceless value, we can fully sympathize.\r\n\r\nIn general contour the body of the fish-lizard was long and tapering,\r\nlike that of a whale (see Plate II.). It probably showed no distinct\r\nneck. The long tail was its chief organ of propulsion. We notice two\r\npairs of fins, or paddles; one on the fore part of the body, the other\r\non the hinder part, like the pectoral and abdominal fins of a fish.\r\nThe skin was scaleless and smooth, or slightly wrinkled, like that of\r\na whale. No traces of scales have ever been found; and if such had\r\nexisted, they would certainly have been preserved, since those of\r\nfishes and crocodiles of the Jurassic period have been found in\r\nconsiderable number and variety. It is therefore safe to conclude that\r\nsuch were absent in this case. In the Lias strata, at least, the\r\nspecimens are often preserved with most wonderful completeness (see p.\r\n47).\r\n\r\nThe long and pointed jaws are a striking feature of these animals. The\r\neyes were very large and powerful, and specially adapted, as we shall\r\nsee presently, to the conditions of their life.\r\n\r\nIt might, perhaps, be asked whether the fish-lizards breathed, like\r\nfishes, by means of gills. That question can easily be answered; for\r\nif they had possessed gills for taking in water and breathing the air\r\ndissolved therein, they would reveal the fact by showing a bony\r\nframework for the support of gills, such as are to be found in all\r\nfishes. These structures, known as \"branchial arches,\" are absent;\r\ntherefore the fish-lizards possessed lungs, and breathed air like\r\nreptiles of the present day. Their skulls show where the nostrils were\r\nsituated; namely, near the eyes, and not at the end of the upper\r\njaw-bone. There are also passages in the skull leading from the\r\nnostrils to the palate, along which currents of air passed on their\r\nway to the lungs. Being air-breathers, they would be compelled\r\noccasionally to seek the surface of the sea, in order to obtain a\r\nfresh supply of the life-giving element--oxygen; but, being\r\ncold-blooded and with a small brain, needing a much less supply of\r\noxygen for its work, the fish-lizards had, like fishes, this advantage\r\nover whales, which are warm-blooded--that their stern-propeller, or\r\ntail-fin, could take the form best adapted for a swift,\r\nstraight-forward course through the water.\r\n\r\nIn the whale tribe the tail-fin is horizontal; and this is so on\r\naccount of their need, as large-brained, warm-blooded air-breathers,\r\nof speedy access to the atmospheric air. Were it otherwise, they would\r\nnot have the means of rising with sufficient rapidity to the surface\r\nof the sea; for they have only one pair of fins. But the fish-lizards\r\nhad two pairs of these appendages, and the hinder or pelvic pair no\r\ndoubt were of great service in helping the creatures to come up to the\r\nsurface when necessary.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the whale, with its one pair of paddles, has a tail\r\nspecially planned with a view to rapid vertical movement through the\r\nwater; while in the fish-lizards, who did not require to breathe so\r\nfrequently, the tail-fin was planned with a view to swift and straight\r\nmovement forward as they pursued their prey, and they were compensated\r\nby having bestowed upon them an extra pair of paddles. Thus we learn\r\nhow one part of an animal is related to and dependent upon another,\r\nand how they all work together with the greatest harmony for certain\r\ndefinite purposes (see p. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--(A) Lateral and (B) profile views of a tooth\r\nof _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_ (Conybeare), Lower Lias, Lyme Regis,\r\nDorsetshire, (C) Tooth of _Ichthyosaurus communis_ (Conybeare), Lower\r\nLias, Lyme Regis, Dorset.]\r\n\r\nThese great marine predaceous reptiles literally swarmed in the seas\r\nof the Lias period, and no doubt devoured immense shoals of the\r\nfishes of those times, whose numbers were thus to some extent kept\r\ndown. There is clear proof of this in the fossilised droppings--known\r\nas \"coprolites,\"--which show on examination the broken and comminuted\r\nremains of the little bony plates of ganoid fishes that we know were\r\ncontemporaries of these reptiles. Probably young ones were sometimes\r\ndevoured too.\r\n\r\nIt was in the period of the Lias that fish-lizards attained to their\r\ngreatest development, both in numbers and variety; and the strata of\r\nthat period have preserved some interesting variations. It will be\r\nsufficient here to point out two, namely, Ichthyosaurus\r\ntenuirostris--an elegant little form, in which the jaws, instead of\r\nbeing massive and strong, were long and slender like a bird's beak;\r\nand also Ichthyosaurus latifrons (Fig. 5), with jaws still more\r\nbird-like. Our artist has attempted to show the former variety in our\r\nillustration (Plate II.). A most perfect example of this pretty little\r\nIchthyosaur, from the Lower Lias of Street in Somerset, has recently\r\nbeen presented to the National Collection at South Kensington by Mr.\r\nAlfred Gillett, of Street, and may be seen there. In this group of\r\nfish-lizards the eyes are relatively larger, and we should imagine\r\nthat they were very quick in detecting and catching their prey; their\r\npaddles also have larger bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Skull of _Ichthyosaurus latifrons_.]\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkably fine specimen at Burlington House, in the rooms\r\nof the Geological Society, of an Ichthyosaurus' head, which the writer\r\nfound, on measuring, to be about five feet six inches long. A cast of\r\nthis head is exhibited at South Kensington. The largest of the\r\nspecimens in the National Collection is twenty-two feet long and eight\r\nfeet across the expanded paddles; but it is known that many attained\r\nmuch greater dimensions. Judging from detached heads and parts of\r\nskeletons, it is probable that some of them were between thirty and\r\nforty feet long. A specimen of Ichthyosaurus platyodon in the\r\ncollection of the late Mr. Johnson, of Bristol, has an eye-cavity with\r\na diameter of fourteen inches. This collection is now dispersed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their habits, Sir Richard Owen concludes that they\r\noccasionally sought the shores, crawled on the strand, and basked in\r\nthe sunshine. His reason for this conjecture (which, however, is not\r\nconfirmed by Dr. Fraas's recent discoveries) is to be found in the\r\nbony structure connected with the fore-paddles, which is not to be\r\nfound in any porpoise, dolphin, grampus, or whale, and for want of\r\nwhich these creatures are so helpless when left high and dry on the\r\nshore.[7] The structure in question is a strong bony arch, inverted\r\nand spanning across beneath the chest from one shoulder to the other.\r\nA fish-lizard, when so visiting the shore for sleep, or in the\r\nbreeding season, would lie or crawl, prostrate, with its under side\r\nresting or dragging on the ground--somewhat after the manner of a\r\nturtle.\r\n\r\n[7] It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to remark that whales are not\r\nfishes, but mammals which have undergone great change in order to\r\nadapt themselves to a marine life. Their hind limbs have practically\r\nvanished, only a rudiment of them being left.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that this bony arch resembles the same part in\r\nthose singular and problematical mammals, the Echidna and the\r\nPlatypus, or duck-mole.\r\n\r\nThe enormous magnitude and peculiar construction of the eye are highly\r\ninteresting features. The expanded pupil must have allowed of the\r\nadmittance of a large quantity of light, so that the creature\r\npossessed great powers of vision.\r\n\r\nThe organic remains associated with fish-lizards tell us that they\r\ninhabited waters of moderate depth, such as prevails near a coast-line\r\nor among coral islands. Moreover, an air-breathing creature would\r\nobviously be unable to live in \"the depths of the sea;\" for it would\r\ntake a long time to get to the surface for a fresh supply of air.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no part of the skeleton is more interesting than the curious\r\ncircular series of bony plates surrounding the iris and pupil of the\r\neye. The eyes of many fishes are defended by a bony covering\r\nconsisting of two pieces; but a circle of bony overlapping plates is\r\nnow only found in the eyes of turtles, tortoises, lizards, and birds,\r\nand some alligators. This elaborate apparatus must have been of some\r\nspecial use; the question is--What service or services did it perform?\r\nHere, again, we find answers suggested by Owen and Buckland. It would\r\naid, they say, in protecting the eye-ball from the waves of the sea\r\nwhen the creature rose to the surface, as well as from the pressure of\r\nthe water when it dived down to the bottom--for even at a slight depth\r\npressure increases, as divers know. But it appears that the ring of\r\nbony plates fulfilled a yet more important office, thereby enabling\r\nthe fish-lizards to play admirably their part in the world in which\r\nthey lived, and to succeed in the struggle of life; for even in those\r\nremote days there must have been, as now, a keen competition among all\r\nanimals, so that the victory was to those that were best equipped.\r\n\r\nWould it not be an advantage for them to have the power of seeing\r\ntheir finny prey whether near or far? Certainly it would; and so we\r\nare told that, by bringing the plates a little nearer together, and\r\ncausing them to press gently on the eye-ball, so as to make the eye\r\nmore convex--that is, bulging out--a nearer object would be the better\r\ndiscerned. On the other hand, by relaxing this pressure, thus\r\nenlarging the aperture of the pupil and diminishing the convexity, a\r\ndistant object would be focussed upon the retina. In this manner some\r\nbirds alter the focus of their eyes while swooping down on their prey.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful arrangement! We often hear of people having two pairs\r\nof spectacles--with lenses of different curvature--one for reading,\r\nand the other for seeing more distant objects than a book held in the\r\nhand. But here is a creature that possessed an apparatus far more\r\nsimple and effective than that supplied by the optician! Dr. Buckland,\r\nspeaking of these \"sclerotic plates,\" as they are called, says they\r\nshow \"that the enormous eye of which they formed the front was an\r\noptical instrument of varied and prodigious power, enabling the\r\nIchthyosaurus to descry its prey in the obscurity of night and in the\r\ndepths of the sea.\" But the last expression must be taken in a limited\r\nsense (see Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Head of _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_.]\r\n\r\nIt might well be supposed that no record had been preserved from which\r\nwe could learn anything about the nature of the skin of our\r\nfish-lizard; but even this wish has been partly fulfilled, to the\r\ndelight of all geologists. Certain specimens have been obtained, from\r\nthe Lias of England and Germany, that show faithful impressions of the\r\nskin that covered the paddles. A specimen of this nature has lately\r\nbeen presented to the national treasure-house at South Kensington by\r\nMr. Montague Brown. On the inner side of the paddle was a broad\r\nfin-like expansion, admirably adapted to obtain the full advantage of\r\nthe stroke of the limb in swimming.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] Mr. Smith Woodward informs the writer that specimens have lately\r\nbeen found near Würtemberg, with evidence of a triangular fin on the\r\nback. Plate II. has been redrawn for this edition, to make it more in\r\nharmony with Dr. Fraas's discoveries. (See Appendix V.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the limbs, it should be mentioned that the bones of each\r\nfinger, instead of being elongated and limited in number to three in\r\neach of the five fingers, are polygonal in shape and arranged in as\r\nmany as seven or eight rows, while those of each finger are\r\nexceedingly numerous. Thus the whole structure forms a kind of bony\r\npavement which must have been very supple. Such a limb would be one of\r\nthe most efficient and powerful swimming organs known in the whole\r\nanimal kingdom. In whales the fingers of the flippers are of the usual\r\nnumber, namely, five. Some species of fish-lizards had as many as over\r\na hundred separate little bones in the fore-paddle.\r\n\r\nAnother question naturally suggests itself: Were they viviparous, or\r\ndid they lay eggs like crocodiles? This question seems to have been\r\nanswered in favour of the first supposition; and in the following\r\ninteresting manner. It not infrequently happens that entire little\r\nskeletons of very small individuals are found under the ribs of large\r\nones. They are invariably uninjured, and of the same species as the\r\none that encloses them, and with the head pointing in one direction.\r\nSuch specimens are most probably the fossilised remains of little\r\nfish-lizards, that were yet unborn when their mothers met with an\r\nuntimely end (see p. 51). In some cases, however, they may be young\r\nones that were swallowed. (See Appendix V.)\r\n\r\nThe jaws of these hungry formidable monsters were provided with a\r\nseries of formidable teeth--sometimes over two hundred in\r\nnumber--inserted in a long groove, and not in distinct sockets, as in\r\nthe case of crocodiles. In some cases, sixty or more have been found\r\non each side of the upper and lower jaws, giving a total of over two\r\nhundred and forty teeth! The larger teeth may be two inches or more in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe jaws were admirably constructed on a plan that combined lightness,\r\nelasticity, and strength. Instead of consisting of one piece only,\r\nthey show a union of plates of bone, as in recent crocodiles. These\r\nplates are strongest and most numerous just where the greatest\r\nstrength was wanted, and thinner and fewer towards the extremities of\r\nthe jaw. A crocodile, Sir Samuel Baker says, in his _Wild Beasts and\r\ntheir Ways_, can bite a man in two; and no doubt our fish-lizard\r\nwould have been glad to perform the same feat! But in his pre-Adamite\r\ndays the opportunity did not present itself.\r\n\r\nThe spinal column, or backbone, with its generally concave vertebræ,\r\nmust have been highly flexible, as is that of a fish, especially the\r\nlong tail which the creature worked rapidly from side to side as it\r\nlashed the waters.\r\n\r\nThe hollows of these concave vertebræ must have been originally filled\r\nup with fluid forming an elastic bag, or capsule. To get a clearer\r\nidea of this, take a small portion of the backbone of a boiled cod, or\r\nother \"bony\" fish, and you will see on pulling it to pieces, the\r\nwhite, jelly-like substance that fills up the hollows between the\r\nvertebræ. In this way Nature provides a soft cushion between the\r\njoints, that allows of a certain amount of movement, while, at the\r\nsame time, the column holds together. The backbone of a fish may not\r\ninaptly be compared to a railway train. Each of the carriages\r\nrepresents a vertebra, and the buffers act as cushions when the train\r\nis bent in running round a curve. After all, we must learn from\r\nNature; and many of the greatest mechanical and engineering triumphs\r\nof to-day are based upon the methods used by Nature in the building up\r\nand equipment of vegetable and animal forms of life.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be inquired whether there is any evidence for the\r\nexistence of a tail-fin, such as is shown in our illustration. To this\r\nit may be replied that the presence of such an appendage is as good as\r\nproved by a certain flattening of the vertebræ at the end of the tail,\r\ndetected by Owen. The direction of this flattening is from side to\r\nside, and therefore the tail-fin must have been vertical, like that of\r\na fish. In one specimen Sir Richard Owen has detected as many as 156\r\nvertebræ to the whole body.\r\n\r\nOur description of the fish-lizard has, we trust, been\r\nsufficient--although not couched in the language used by men of\r\nscience--to give a fair idea of its structure and habits.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a few words may be said about the ancestry and\r\nlife-history of these ancient monsters. Palæontologists have good\r\nreason to believe that they were descended from some early form of\r\nland reptile. If so, they show that whales are not the first land\r\nanimals that have gone back to the sea, from which so many forms of\r\nlife have taken their rise.\r\n\r\nDuring the long Mesozoic period fish-lizards played the part that\r\nwhales now play in the economy of the world; and they resembled the\r\nlatter, not only in general shape, but in the situation of the\r\nnostrils (near the eye), and in their teeth and long jaws. But these\r\ncurious resemblances must not be interpreted to mean that whales and\r\nfish-lizards are related to each other. They only show that similar\r\nmodes of life tend to produce artificial resemblances--just as some\r\nwhales, in their turn, show a superficial resemblance to fishes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the particular form of reptile from which the\r\nfish-lizard may have been derived, no certain conclusion has at\r\npresent been arrived at. This is chiefly from want of fuller knowledge\r\nof early forms, such as may have existed in the previous periods known\r\nas the Carboniferous and Trias (see Appendix I.). But there are\r\ncertain features in the skulls, teeth, and vertebræ that suggest a\r\nrelationship with the Labyrinthodonts, or primæval salamanders that\r\nflourished during the above periods, or at least from amphibians more\r\nor less closely allied to them. They cannot by any possibility be\r\nregarded as modified fishes; for fishes have gills instead of lungs.\r\n\r\nThe fish-lizards played their part, and played it admirably; but their\r\ndays were numbered, and the place they occupied has since been taken\r\nby a higher type--the mammal. As reptiles, they were eminently a\r\nsuccess; but, then, they were only reptiles, and therefore were at\r\nlast left behind in the struggle for existence, until finally they\r\ndied out, at the end of the Cretaceous period, when certain important\r\ngeographical and other changes took place, helping to cause the\r\nextinction of many other strange forms of life, as we shall see later\r\non (see p. 147).\r\n\r\nThey had a wide geographical range; for their remains have been\r\ndiscovered in Arctic regions, in Europe, India, Ceram, North America,\r\nthe east coast of Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn American deposits they are represented by certain toothless forms,\r\nto which the name Sauranodon (\"toothless lizard\") has been given.\r\nThese have been discovered by Professor Marsh, in the Jurassic strata\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. They were eight or nine feet long, and in\r\nevery other respect resembled Ichthyosaurs. As we have endeavoured to\r\nindicate in our illustration, the fish-lizards flourished in seas\r\nwherein animal, and doubtless vegetable life was very abundant. Any\r\none who has collected fossils from the Lias of England will have found\r\nhow full it is of beautiful organic remains, such as corals, mollusca,\r\nencrinites, sea-urchins, and other echinoids, fishes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe climate of this period in Europe was mild and genial, or even\r\nsemi-tropical. Coral reefs and coral islands varied the landscape.\r\nThere is just one more point of interest that ought not to be omitted;\r\nit refers to the manner in which these reptiles of the Lias age met\r\ntheir deaths, and were thus buried up in their rocky tombs. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell and other writers point out that the individuals found\r\nin those strata must have met with a sudden death and quick burial;\r\nfor if their uncovered bodies had been left, even for a few hours,\r\nexposed to putrification and the attacks of fishes at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, we should not now find their remains so completely preserved\r\nthat often scarcely a single bone has been moved from its right place.\r\nWhat was the exact nature of this operation is at present a matter of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SEA-LIZARDS AND THEIR ALLIES.\r\n\r\n     \"The wonders of geology exercise every faculty of the\r\n     mind--reason, memory, imagination; and though we cannot put\r\n     our fossils to the question, it is something to be so aroused\r\n     as to be made to put the questions to one's self.\"--Hugh\r\n     Miller.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fish-lizards, described in our last chapter, were not the only\r\npredaceous monsters that haunted the seas of the great Mesozoic age,\r\nor era. We must now say a few words about certain contemporary\r\ncreatures that shared with them the spoils of those old seas, so\r\nteeming with life. And first among these--as being more fully\r\nknown--come the long-necked sea-lizards, or Plesiosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurus was first discovered in the Lias rocks of Lyme-Regis,\r\nin the year 1821. It was christened by the above name, and introduced\r\nto the scientific world by the Rev. Mr. Conybeare (afterwards Dean of\r\nLlandaff) and Mr. (afterwards Sir Henry) de la Beche. They gave it\r\nthis name in order to distinguish it from the Ichthyosaurus, and to\r\nrecord the fact that it was more nearly allied to the lizard than the\r\nlatter.[9] Conybeare, with the assistance of De la Beche, first\r\ndescribed it in a now-classic paper read before the Geological Society\r\nof London, and published in the _Transactions_ of that Society in the\r\nyear 1821. In a later paper (1824) he gave a restoration of the\r\nentire skeleton of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus; and the accuracy of\r\nthat restoration is still universally acknowledged. This fine specimen\r\nwas in the possession of the Duke of Buckingham, who kindly placed it\r\nat the disposal of Dr. Buckland, for a time, that it might be properly\r\ndescribed and investigated.\r\n\r\n[9] The name is derived from two Greek words--_plesios_, near, or\r\nallied to, and _sauros_, a lizard.\r\n\r\nA glance at our illustration, Plate III., will show that this strange\r\ncreature was not inaptly compared at the time to a snake threaded\r\nthrough the body of a turtle.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland truly observes that the discovery of this genus forms one\r\nof the most important additions that geology has made to comparative\r\nanatomy. \"It is of the Plesiosaurus,\" says that graphic author, in his\r\n_Bridgewater Treatise_, \"that Cuvier asserts the structure to have\r\nbeen the most heteroclite, and its characters altogether the most\r\nmonstrous that have been yet found amid the ruins of a former world.\r\nTo the head of a lizard it united the teeth of a crocodile; a neck of\r\nenormous length, resembling the body of a serpent; a trunk and tail\r\nhaving the proportions of an ordinary quadruped; the ribs of a\r\nchameleon, and the paddles of a whale! Such are the strange\r\ncombinations of form and structure in the Plesiosaurus--a genus, the\r\nremains of which, after interment for thousands of years amidst the\r\nwreck of millions of extinct inhabitants of the ancient earth, are at\r\nlength recalled to light by the researches of the geologist, and\r\nsubmitted to our examination in nearly as perfect a state as the bones\r\nof species that are now existing upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way in which we can gain a clear idea of the general\r\ncharacters of a long-necked sea-lizard, as we may call our\r\nPlesiosaurus, is by comparing it with the fish-lizard, described in\r\nthe last chapter. Its long neck and small head are the most\r\nconspicuous features. Then we notice the short tail. But if we compare\r\nthe paddles of these two extinct forms of life, we notice at once\r\ncertain important differences. In the fish-lizard the bone of the arm\r\nwas very short, while all the bones of the fore-arm and fingers were\r\nmodified into little many-sided bodies, and so articulated together as\r\nto make the whole limb, or paddle, a solid yet flexible structure. In\r\nthe long-necked sea-lizard, however, we find a long arm-bone with a\r\nclub-like shape; and the two bones of the fore-arm are seen to be\r\nlonger than in the fish-lizard. But a still greater difference shows\r\nitself in the bones of the finger, as we look at a fossilised skeleton\r\n(or a drawing of one); for the fingers are long and slender, like\r\nthose of ordinary reptiles.\r\n\r\nThere are only five fingers, and each finger is quite distinct from\r\nthe others. This is the reason why the Plesiosaur was considered to\r\ndepart less from the type of an ordinary reptile, and so received its\r\nname. Other remarkable differences present themselves in the shoulders\r\nand haunches, but these need not be considered here. The species shown\r\nin Fig. 8 had rather a large head. It is obvious that such a long\r\nslender neck as these creatures had could not have supported a large\r\nhead, like that of the fish-lizard. Consequently, we find a striking\r\ncontrast in the skulls of the two forms. That of the Plesiosaur was\r\nshort and stout, and therefore such as could easily be supported, as\r\nwell as rapidly moved about by the long slender neck. Thus we find\r\nanother simple illustration of the \"law of correlation,\" alluded to on\r\np. 6. The teeth were set in distinct sockets, as they are in\r\ncrocodiles, to which animals there are also points of resemblance, in\r\nthe backbone, ribs, and skull. Fig. 7 shows three different types of\r\nlower jaws of Plesiosaurs. The one marked C belongs to Plesiosaurus\r\ndolichodeirus, the species represented in our plate. There were no\r\nbony plates in the eye. Professor Owen thinks that they were\r\nlong-lived. The skin was probably smooth, like that of a porpoise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III.\r\n\r\nPTERODACTYLS. LONG-NECKED SEA-LIZARD.

They were mostly obtained from the Lias formation of\r\nStreet in Somersetshire, Lyme-Regis in Dorset, and Whitby in\r\nYorkshire. Those from the Lias are mostly small, about eight to ten\r\nfeet in length. But in the rocks of the Cretaceous period, which was\r\nlater, are found larger specimens. There is a cast of a very fine\r\nspecimen from the Upper Lias on the wall of the east corridor (No. 3\r\non Plan) of the geological galleries at South Kensington, which is\r\ntwenty-two feet long. But some of the Cretaceous forms, both in Europe\r\nand America, attained a length of forty feet, and had vertebræ six\r\ninches in diameter. The bodies of the vertebræ, or \"cup-bones,\" are\r\neither flat or slightly concave, showing that the backbone as a whole\r\nwas less flexible than in the fish-lizards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--_Plesiosaurus macrocephalus._]\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that Mr. Smith Woodward, of the Natural\r\nHistory Museum, recently showed the writer a fossil Plesiosaur that is\r\nbeing set up in the formatore's shop, in the same manner that a recent\r\nskeleton might be. In this, and many other ways, the guardians of the\r\nnational treasure-house are endeavouring to make the collection\r\nintelligible and interesting to the general public. Specimens of\r\nextinct animals thus set up, give one a much better idea than when the\r\nbones are all lying huddled together on a slab of rock. But it is not\r\nalways possible to get the bones entirely out of their rocky bed, or\r\nmatrix. Great credit is due to Mr. Alfred N. Leeds, of Eyebury, who\r\nhas disinterred the separate bones of many distinct skeletons of\r\nPlesiosaurs from Oxford Clay strata near Peterborough.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the long and powerful tail of the\r\nfish-lizard was its principal organ of propulsion through the water;\r\nand that, consequently, the paddles only played a secondary part. They\r\nwere small, but amply large enough for the work they had to perform.\r\nBut our long-necked sea-lizards possessed very short tails. What,\r\nthen, was the consequence? Obviously that the paddles had all the more\r\nwork to do. They were the chief swimming organs. The vertebræ of this\r\nshort tail show that it probably was highly flexible, and could move\r\nrapidly from side to side; but, for all that, its use as a propeller\r\nwould not be of much importance. We see now why the paddles are so\r\nlong and powerful, like two pairs of great oars, one pair on each side\r\nof the body. In a fossil skeleton you will notice the flattened shape\r\nof the arm-bone (or humerus), and of the thigh-bone (or femur). This\r\ngave breadth to the paddles, and made them more efficient as swimming\r\norgans. They give no indication of having carried even such imperfect\r\nclaws as those of turtles and seals, and therefore we may conclude\r\nthat the Plesiosaur was far more at home in the water than on land,\r\nand it seems probable that progression on land was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe tail was probably useful as a rudder, to steer the animal when\r\nswimming on the surface, and to elevate or depress it in ascending and\r\ndescending through the water. Like the fish-lizard, this creature was\r\nan air-breather, and therefore was obliged occasionally to visit the\r\nsurface for fresh supplies of air. But probably it possessed the power\r\nof compressing air within its lungs, so that the frequency of its\r\nvisits to the surface would not be very great.\r\n\r\nFrom the long neck and head, situated so far away from the paddles, as\r\nwell as for other reasons, it may be concluded that this creature was\r\na rapid swimmer, as was the Ichthyosaurus. Although of considerable\r\nsize, it probably had to seek its food, as well as its safety, chiefly\r\nby artifice and concealment. The fish-lizard, its contemporary, must\r\nhave been a formidable rival and a dangerous enemy, whom to attack\r\nwould be unadvisable.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the habits of the long-necked sea-lizard, Mr. Conybeare,\r\nin his second paper, already alluded to, says, \"That it was aquatic,\r\nis evident from the form of its paddles; that it was marine, is almost\r\nequally so, from the remains with which it is universally associated;\r\nthat it may occasionally have visited the shore, the resemblance of\r\nits extremities to those of the turtle may lead us to conjecture; its\r\nmotion, however, must have been very awkward on land; its long neck\r\nmust have impeded its progress through the water, presenting a\r\nstriking contrast to the organisation which so admirably fits the\r\nIchthyosaurus to cut through the waves.\r\n\r\n\"May it not therefore be concluded (since, in addition to these\r\ncircumstances, its respiration must have required frequent access of\r\nair) that it swam upon or near the surface, arching back its long neck\r\nlike the swan, occasionally darting it down at the fish which happened\r\nto float within its reach? It may, perhaps, have lurked in shoal-water\r\nalong the coast, concealed among the sea-weed, and, raising its\r\nnostrils to a level with the surface from a considerable depth, may\r\nhave found a secure retreat from the assaults of dangerous enemies;\r\nwhile the length and flexibility of its neck may have compensated for\r\nthe want of strength in its jaws and its incapacity for swift motion\r\nthrough the water, by the suddenness and agility of the attack which\r\nthey enabled it to make on every animal fitted for its prey, which\r\ncame within its extensive sweep.\"\r\n\r\nMore than twenty species of long-necked sea-lizards are known to\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, in his great work on _British Fossil Reptiles_, when\r\ndescribing the huge Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus from Dorset, suggests\r\nthat the carcase of this monster, after it sank to the bottom of the\r\nsea, was preyed upon by some carnivorous animal (perhaps sharks). It\r\nseems, he says, as if a bite of the neck had pulled out of place the\r\neighth to the twelfth vertebræ. Those at the base of the neck are\r\nscattered and dispersed as if through more \"tugging and riving.\" So\r\nwith regard to its body, probably some hungry creature had a grip of\r\nthe spine near the middle of the back, and pulled all the succeeding\r\nvertebræ in the region of the hind limbs. Thus we get a little glimpse\r\nof scenes of violence that took place at the bottom of the bright\r\nsunny seas of the period when the clays and limestones of the Lias\r\nrocks were being deposited in the region of Lyme-Regis.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, these curious reptiles increased in size, until, in\r\nthe period when our English chalk was being formed (Cretaceous\r\nperiod), they reached their highest point (see p. 147). After that\r\nthey became extinct--whether slowly or somewhat suddenly we cannot\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nUntil more is known of the ancient life of the earth, it will not be\r\npossible to say with certainty what were the nearest relations of the\r\nlong-necked sea-lizards. They first appear in the strata of the New\r\nRed Sandstone, which is below the Lias. Certain little reptiles, about\r\nthree feet long, from the former rocks, known as Neusticosaurus and\r\nLariosaurus, seem to be rather closely related to the creatures we are\r\nnow considering, and to connect them with another group, namely, the\r\nPliosaurs. They were partly terrestrial and partly aquatic; but it is\r\nnot easy to say whether their limbs had been converted into true\r\npaddles or not. At any rate, there is every reason to believe that the\r\nlong-necked sea-lizards were descended from an earlier form of land\r\nreptile. They gradually underwent considerable modifications, in order\r\nto adapt themselves to an aquatic life. We noticed that the same\r\nconclusion has been arrived at with regard to the fish-lizards. Both\r\nthese extinct groups, therefore, present an interesting analogy to\r\nwhales, which are now considered to have been derived, by a like\r\nseries of changes, from mammals that once walked the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaur presents, on the one hand, points of resemblance to\r\nturtles and lizards,--on the other hand, to crocodiles, whales, and,\r\naccording to some authorities, even the strange Ornithorhynchus. But\r\nit will be very long before its ancestry can be made known. In the\r\nmean time, we must put it in a place somewhere near the fish-lizards,\r\nand leave posterity to complete what has at present only been begun.\r\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that some of the above resemblances\r\nare purely accidental, and not such as point to relationship. Because\r\ntheir flippers are like those of a whale, it does not mean that\r\nPlesiosaurs are related to modern whales. It only means that similar\r\nhabits tend to produce accidental resemblances--just as the whales and\r\nporpoises, in their turn, resemble fishes. To make torpedoes go\r\nrapidly through the water, inventors have given them a fish-like\r\nshape;--in the same way the early forms of mammals, from which whales\r\nare descended, gradually adapted themselves to a life in the water,\r\nand so became modified to some extent to the shapes of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe Pliosaurs, above mentioned, are evidently relations, but with\r\nshort necks instead of long ones. They had enormous heads and thick\r\nnecks. Fine specimens of their huge jaws, paddle-bones, etc., may be\r\nseen at the end of the reptile-gallery at Cromwell Road. One of the\r\nskulls exhibited there is nearly six feet long, while a hind paddle\r\nmeasures upwards of six and a half feet in length, of which\r\nthirty-seven inches is taken up by the thigh-bone alone. The teeth at\r\nthe end of the jaws are truly enormous. One tooth, from a deposit\r\nknown as the Kimmeridge Clay, is nearly a foot long from the tip of\r\nthe crown to the base of the root. In some, the two jaw-bones of the\r\nlower jaw are partly united, as in the sperm-whale or cachalot.\r\nCreatures so armed must have been very destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DRAGONS OF OLD TIME--DINOSAURS.\r\n\r\n     \"What we know is but little; what we do not know is\r\n     immense.\"--La Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there ever an age of dragons? Tradition says there was; but there\r\nis every reason to believe that the fierce and blood-thirsty\r\ncreatures, of which such a variety present themselves, are but\r\ncreations of the imagination,--useful in their way, no doubt, as\r\npointing a moral or adorning a tale, but, nevertheless, wholly without\r\nfoundation in fact. The dragon figures in the earliest traditions of\r\nthe human race, and crops up again in full force in European mediæval\r\nor even late romance.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egyptian mythology, Horus, the son of Isis, slays the evil\r\ndragon. In Greece, the infant Hercules, while yet in his cradle,\r\nstrangles deadly snakes; and Perseus, after engaging in fierce\r\nstruggle with the sea-monster, slays it, and rescues Andromeda from a\r\ncruel death. In England, we have the heroic legend of St. George and\r\nthe Dragon depicted on our sovereigns. But it is easy to see a common\r\npurpose running through these legends. They are considered by many to\r\nbe solar myths, and have a moral purpose. The dragons or snakes are\r\nemblems of darkness and evil; the heroes emblems of light, and so of\r\ngood. The triumph of good over evil is the theme they were intended to\r\nillustrate. The dragons, then, are clearly products of the\r\nimagination, based, no doubt, on the huge and uncouth reptiles of the\r\npresent human era, such as crocodiles, pythons, and such creatures.\r\n\r\nAmidst much diversity there is yet a strange similarity in the dragons\r\nthat figure in the folk-lore of Eastern and Western peoples. Probably\r\nour European traditions were brought by the tribes which, wave after\r\nwave, poured in from Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThey are, for the most part, unnatural beasts, breathing out fire, and\r\noften endowed with wings, while at the same time possessing limbs\r\nending in cruel claws, fitted for clutching their unfortunate victims.\r\nThe wings seem, to say the least, very much in the way. Poisonous\r\nfangs, claws, scaly armour, and a long pointed tail were all very\r\nwell,--but wings are hardly wanted, unless to add one more element of\r\nmystery or terror. Some, however, are devoid of wings: the Imperial\r\nJapanese dragons showing no sign of such appendages. The Temple Bar\r\ngriffin is a grim example of a winged monster. Nevertheless, in spite\r\nof all the manifest absurdities of the dragons of various nations and\r\ntimes, geology reveals to us that there once lived upon this earth\r\nreptiles so great and uncouth that we can think of no other but the\r\ntime-honoured word \"dragon\" to convey briefly the slightest idea of\r\ntheir monstrous forms and characters.\r\n\r\nSo there is some truth in dragons, after all. But then we must make\r\nthis important reservation--viz. that the days of these dragons were\r\nlong before the human period; they flourished in one of those dim\r\ngeological ages of which the rocks around us bear ample records.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that human fancy should have, in some cases at\r\nleast, created monsters not very unlike some of those antediluvian\r\nanimals that have, during the present century, been discovered in\r\nvarious parts of Europe and America. Some unreasonable persons will\r\nhave it that certain monstrous reptiles of the Mesozoic era, about to\r\nbe described, must have somehow managed to survive into the human\r\nperiod, and so have suggested to early races of men the dragons to\r\nwhich we have alluded. But there is no need for this untenable\r\nsupposition. By a free blending together of ideas culled from living\r\ntypes of animals it would be very easy to construct no small variety\r\nof dragons; and so we may believe this is what the ancients did.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much of dragons in general, let us proceed to consider\r\nthose both possible and real monsters revealed of late years by the\r\nresearches of geologists. For this purpose we shall devote the present\r\nand two following chapters to the consideration of a great and\r\nwonderful group of fossil reptiles known as Dinosaurs. The strange\r\nfish-lizards and sea-lizards previously described were the geological\r\ncontemporaries of a host of reptiles, now mostly extinct, which\r\ninhabited both the lands and waters of those periods known as the\r\nTriassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, which taken together represent the\r\ngreat Mesozoic, formerly called the Secondary, era.\r\n\r\nThe announcement by Baron Cuvier--the illustrious founder of\r\nPalæontology--that there was a period when our planet was inhabited by\r\nreptiles of appalling magnitude, with many of the features of modern\r\nquadrupeds, was of so novel and startling a character as to require\r\nthe prestige of even his name to obtain for it any degree of credence.\r\nBut subsequent discoveries have fully confirmed the truth of his\r\nbelief, and the \"age of reptiles\" is no longer considered fabulous.\r\nThis expression was first used by Dr. Mantell as the title of a paper\r\npublished in the _Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_ in 1831, and serves\r\nto remind us that reptilian forms of life were once the ruling class\r\namong animals.\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaurs are an extinct order comprising the largest terrestrial\r\nand semi-aquatic reptiles that ever lived; and while some of them in a\r\ngeneral way resembled crocodiles, others show in the bony structures\r\nthey have left behind a very remarkable and interesting resemblance to\r\nbirds of the ostrich tribe. This resemblance shows itself in the\r\npelvis, or bony arch with which the hind limbs are connected in\r\nvertebrate or backboned animals, and in the limbs themselves. This\r\ncurious fact, first brought into notice by Professor Huxley, has been\r\nvariously interpreted by anatomists; some concluding, with Professor\r\nHuxley, that birds are descended from Dinosaurs; while others, with\r\nProfessor Owen, consider the resemblance accidental, and in no way\r\nimplying relationship. Huxley has proposed the name Ornithoscelida, or\r\nbird-legged, for these remarkable reptiles.\r\n\r\nDinosaurs must have formerly inhabited a large part of the primæval\r\nworld; for their remains are found, not only in Europe, but in Africa,\r\nIndia, America, and even in Australia; and the geologist finds that\r\nthey reigned supreme on the earth throughout the whole of the great\r\nMesozoic era.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies were, in some cases, defended by a formidable coat of\r\narmour, consisting of bony plates and spines, as illustrated by the\r\ncase of Scelidosaurus (p. 105), thus giving them a decidedly\r\ndragon-like appearance. The vertebræ, or bony segments of the\r\nbackbone, generally have their centra hollow on both sides, as in the\r\nIchthyosaurus; but in the neck and tail they are not unfrequently\r\nhollow on one side and convex on the other. In some of the largest\r\nforms the vertebræ are excavated into hollow chambers. This is\r\napparently for the sake of lightness; for a very large animal with\r\nheavy solid bones would find it difficult to move freely. In this way\r\nstrength was combined with lightness.\r\n\r\nAll the Dinosaurs had four limbs, and in many cases the hind pair were\r\nvery large compared to the fore limbs. They varied enormously in size,\r\nas well as in appearance. Thus certain of the smaller families were\r\nonly two feet long and lightly built; while others were truly colossal\r\nin size, far out-rivalling our modern rhinoceroses and elephants.\r\n\r\nThe limbs of Cetiosaurus, for example, or of Stegosaurus, remind us\r\nstrikingly of those of elephants. The celebrated Von Meyer was so\r\nstruck with this likeness that he proposed the name Pachypoda for\r\nthem, which means thick-footed. Professor Owen opposed this name; for\r\nit was misleading, and only applied to a few of them. He therefore\r\nproposed the name we have already been using, viz. Dinosauria,[10] and\r\nthis name has been generally retained. We are thus led to connect them\r\nwith lizards and crocodiles, rather than with birds or quadrupeds. The\r\nstrange and curiously mixed characters of the old-fashioned reptiles\r\nis forcibly illustrated by these differences of opinion among leading\r\nnaturalists. Professor Seeley, another living authority, refuses to\r\nconsider them as reptiles, at least in the ordinary sense of the word.\r\n\r\n[10] Greek--_deinos_, terrible; _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nExtinct forms of life are often so very different to the creatures\r\ninhabiting the world of to-day, that naturalists find it a hard task\r\nto assign them their places in the animal kingdom. The classes,\r\norders, and families under which living forms are grouped are often\r\nfound inadequate for the purpose, so much so that new orders and new\r\nfamilies require to be made for them; and then it is often quite\r\nimpossible to determine the relations of these new groups to the old\r\nones we are accustomed to. Dinosaurs offer a good example of this\r\ndifficulty. Were they related to ancient crocodiles? No one can say\r\nfor certain; but it is quite possible, and even probable. Again, did\r\ncertain long-legged Dinosaurs eventually give rise by evolution to the\r\nrunning birds, ostriches, emeus, etc.? This, although supported by\r\nweighty authority, is a matter of speculation: we ought to be very\r\ncareful in accepting such conclusions. It may perhaps be safer to look\r\nupon the ancestry of birds as one of those problems on which the\r\noracle of science cannot at present declare itself.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to classify Dinosaurs, and arrange\r\nthem in family groups; but, considering our imperfect knowledge, it\r\nwill be wise to regard all such attempts as purely temporary and\r\nprovisional, although in some ways convenient. Professor Marsh, of\r\nYale College, U.S., whose wonderful discoveries in the far West have\r\nattracted universal attention, has grouped the Dinosaurs into five\r\nsub-orders. It will, however, be sufficient for our purpose if we\r\nfollow certain English authorities who divide them into three\r\ngroups--taking the names given by Professor Marsh, only running\r\ntogether some which he would separate.\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider the very interesting and huge forms included\r\nin his sub-order the Sauropoda, or lizard-footed Dinosaurs. Various\r\nparts of the skeletons, such as vertebræ, leg-bones, etc., of these\r\ncumbrous beasts have long been known in this country; but Professor\r\nMarsh was the first person to discover a complete skeleton.\r\n\r\nWe shall, therefore, now turn our attention to the bony framework of\r\nthe huge Brontosaurus (Fig. 9), a vegetable-feeding lizard. But it\r\nwill be necessary to completely lay aside all our previous notions\r\ntaken from lizards of the present day, with their short legs and\r\nsnake-like scaly bodies, before we can come to any fair conclusion\r\nwith regard to this monstrous beast.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly sixty feet long, and probably when alive weighed more\r\nthan twenty tons! that it was a stupid, slow-moving reptile, may be\r\ninferred from its very small brain and slender spinal cord. By taking\r\ncasts of the brain-cavities in the skulls of extinct animals,\r\nanatomists can obtain a very good idea of the nature and capacity of\r\ntheir brains; and in this way important evidence is obtained, and such\r\nas helps to throw light upon their habits and general intelligence. No\r\nbony plates or spines have been discovered with the remains of this\r\nmonster; so that we are driven to conclude that it was wholly without\r\narmour: and, moreover, there seem to be no signs of offensive weapons\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh concludes that it was more or less amphibious in its\r\nhabits, and that it fed upon aquatic plants and other succulent\r\nvegetation. Its remains, he says, are generally found in localities\r\nwhere the animal had evidently become mired, just as cattle at the\r\npresent day sometimes become hopelessly fixed in a swampy place on the\r\nmargin of a lake or river (see p. 19). Each track made by the creature\r\nin walking occupied one square yard in extent!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Restored skeleton of _Brontosaurus excelsus_.\r\n(After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe remarkably small head is one of the most striking features of this\r\nDinosaur, and presents a curious contrast to the large and formidable\r\nskulls possessed by some other forms to be described further on. But\r\nit is clear that no animal with such a long neck as this creature had\r\ncould have borne the weight of a heavy skull. Short thick necks and\r\nheavy skulls always go together. Indeed, the weight of the long neck\r\nitself would have been serious had it not been for the fact that the\r\nvertebræ in this part of the skeleton, and as far as the region of the\r\ntail, have large cavities in the sides of the centra. This cavernous\r\nstructure of the vertebræ gradually decreases towards the tail. The\r\ncavities communicated with a series of internal cavities which give a\r\nkind of honeycombed structure to the whole vertebra. This arrangement\r\naffords a combination of strength and lightness in the massive\r\nsupports required for the huge ribs, limbs, and muscles, such as could\r\nnot have been provided by any other plan. (See Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Neck vertebræ of _Brontosaurus_.\r\n\r\n1. Front view. 2. Back view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC DINOSAUR, BRONTOSAURUS EXCELSUS.\r\n\r\nLength nearly 60 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe body of the Brontosaur was comparatively short, with a fairly\r\nlarge paunch (see restoration, Plate IV.). The legs and feet were\r\nstrong and massive, and the limb-bones solid. As if partly in order to\r\nbalance the neck, we find a long and powerful tail, in which the\r\nvertebræ are nearly all solid. In most Dinosaurs the fore limbs are\r\nsmall compared to the hind limbs--_e.g._ Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, and\r\nScelidosaurus,--but here we find them unusually large. In this case,\r\nthen, it is hardly possible that the creature walked upon its hind\r\nlegs, as many of the Dinosaurs did. But, at the same time, we may\r\nbelieve that occasionally it assumed a more erect position; and may\r\nnot the light hollowed structure of the vertebræ in the fore part of\r\nthe body, already alluded to, have imparted such lightness as made it\r\npossible for the creature to assume such attitudes? There can be\r\nlittle doubt but that many other fierce and formidable Dinosaurs were\r\nliving at the same time and in the same region with Brontosaurus,\r\nwhose remains are found in the Jurassic rocks of Colorado\r\n(Atlantosaurus beds).\r\n\r\nHow this apparently helpless and awkward animal escaped in the\r\nstruggle for existence it is not easy to conjecture; but since there\r\nis reason to believe it was more or less at home in the water, and\r\ncould use its powerful tail in swimming, we may perhaps find a way out\r\nof the difficulty by supposing that, when alarmed by dangerous\r\nflesh-eating foes, it took to the water, and found discretion to be\r\nthe better part of valour. Although apparently stupid, the Brontosaur\r\nprobably possessed a good deal of cunning, and we can fancy it\r\nstretching its long neck above reeds, ferns, and cycads to get a view\r\nof the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Sauropoda, or lizard-footed Dinosaurs, show in many ways a decided\r\napproach to a simple or generalised crocodile; so much so, that\r\nProfessor Cope is inclined to include crocodiles and sauropodous\r\nDinosaurs in the same order. Still, there are important differences in\r\nother members of this sub-order. Unfortunately, our knowledge is at\r\npresent rather limited, owing to the want of complete skeletons.\r\nVertebræ, limb-bones, skulls, and teeth have all been discovered\r\nthrough the zeal and energy of Professor Marsh and his comrades, in\r\nthe far west of America, as well as by the researches of English\r\ngeologists, assisted by the labours of many ardent collectors of\r\nfossils, in this country. Some of these may now be briefly considered.\r\n\r\nIn Plate V. we have endeavoured to give some idea of a huge thigh-bone\r\n(femur) belonging to the truly gigantic Dinosaur called Atlantosaurus.\r\nIt is six feet two inches long, and a cast of it may be seen in the\r\nfossil reptile gallery of the British Museum of Natural History\r\n(Wall-case No. 3). It should be mentioned, however, that the original\r\nspecimen is partly restored, so that its exact length to an inch or so\r\nis not quite certain. In our illustration it is shown to be a little\r\ntaller, when placed upright, than a full-grown man. Professor Marsh,\r\nthe fortunate discoverer of this wonderful bone, calculates that the\r\nAtlantosaurus must have attained a length of over eighty feet! and,\r\nassuming that it walked upon its hind feet, a height of thirty feet!\r\n\r\nIt doubtless fed upon the luxuriant foliage of the sub-tropical\r\nforests, portions of which are preserved with its remains. Besides\r\nthis thigh-bone, Professor Marsh has procured specimens of vertebræ\r\nfrom the different parts of the vertebral column; but no skull or\r\nteeth. The vertebræ are hollowed out much in the same way as those of\r\nBrontosaurus. The fore limbs were large, as in the latter animal; and\r\nthe extremities of the limbs were provided with claws. Taking all\r\npresent evidence, it appears that the Atlantosaurus bore a general\r\nresemblance to its smaller contemporary. We can therefore form a\r\nfairly good idea of its aspect and proportions.\r\n\r\nThe same Jurassic strata from the Rocky Mountains have yielded remains\r\nof another big Dinosaur, belonging to the same family. This genus,\r\nwhich has been named the Apatosaurus, is represented by a nearly\r\ncomplete skeleton, in the Yale College Museum; and is fortunately in\r\nan excellent state of preservation. Another species, of smaller size,\r\nthough not so complete, adorns the same collection. This was about\r\nthirty feet long, and is known as Apatosaurus grandis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate V.\r\n\r\nTHIGH-BONE OF THE LARGEST OF THE DINOSAURS, ATLANTOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nFrom a cast in the Natural History Museum. Length 6 feet 2 inches.]\r\n\r\nMorosaurus, another important genus, is known from a large number of\r\nindividuals discovered in the now famous Atlantosaurus beds of\r\nColorado, including one nearly complete skeleton. The head of this\r\ncreature was small; the neck elongated; and the vertebræ of the neck\r\nare lightened by deep cavities in their centra, similar to those in\r\nbirds of flight. The tail, also, was long. When alive, this Dinosaur\r\nwas about forty feet in length. It probably walked on all fours; and\r\nin many other respects was very unlike a typical Dinosaur. The brain\r\nwas small, and it must have been sluggish in all its movements. The\r\nnearly complete remains of Morosaurus grandis were found together in a\r\nvery good state of preservation in Wyoming, and many of the bones lay\r\njust in their natural positions.\r\n\r\nDiplodocus, of which several incomplete specimens have been\r\ndiscovered, was intermediate in size between Atlantosaurus and\r\nMorosaurus, and may have reached when living, a length of forty or\r\nfifty feet. Its skull was of moderate size, with slender jaws. The\r\nteeth were weaker than those of any other known Dinosaur, and entirely\r\nconfined to the front of the jaws. Professor Marsh concludes from the\r\nteeth that Diplodocus was herbivorous, feeding on succulent\r\nvegetation, and that it probably led an aquatic life. Fig. 11 shows\r\nits skull.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this interesting Dinosaur (Brontosaurus), which in\r\nseveral ways differs from other members of the \"lizard-footed\" group,\r\nwere found in Upper Jurassic beds, near Cañon City, Colorado. A second\r\nsmaller species was also discovered near Morrison, Colorado. All the\r\nremains lay in the Atlantosaurus beds. These strata--the tomb in which\r\nNature has buried up so many of her dragons of old time--can be traced\r\nfor several hundred miles on the flanks of the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nare always to be known by the bones they contain. They lie above the\r\nTriassic strata and just below the Sandstone of the Dakota group. Some\r\nhave regarded them as of Cretaceous age; but, judging from their\r\nfossils, there can be but little doubt that they were deposited\r\nduring the Jurassic period--probably in an old estuary. They consist\r\nof shale and sandstone.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous Dinosaurs, Professor Marsh's colleagues have\r\nfound abundant remains of crocodiles, tortoises, and fishes, with one\r\nPterodactyl, a flying reptile (see chap. viii.), and several small\r\nmarsupials. The wonderful collection of American Jurassic Dinosaurs in\r\nthe Museum of Yale College includes the remains of several hundred\r\nindividuals, many of them in excellent preservation, and has afforded\r\nto Professor Marsh the material for his classification already alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Head of _Diplodocus_.\r\n\r\n1. Side view. 2. Front view.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Dinosaurs of the Lizard-footed Group.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are at present no complete skeletons known of\r\nEnglish Dinosaurs related to the American forms above described. But,\r\nsince the English fossils were first in evidence by many years, and\r\nMarsh's discoveries have confirmed in a remarkable way conclusions\r\ndrawn by Owen, Huxley, Hulke, and Seeley, and others from materials\r\nthat were rather fragmentary, it may be worth while to give some\r\naccount of these remains and the interpretations they have received.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland, in his _Bridgewater Treatise_, 1836, referred to a\r\nlimb-bone in the Oxford Museum, from the great Oolite formation near\r\nWoodstock, which was examined by Cuvier, and pronounced to have once\r\nbelonged to a whale; also a very large rib, which seemed whale-like.\r\nIn 1838 Professor Owen, when collecting materials for his famous\r\n_Report on the Fossil Reptiles of Great Britain_, inspected this\r\nremarkable limb-bone, and could not match it with any bones known\r\namong the whale tribe; and yet its structure, where exposed, was like\r\nthat of the long bone (humerus) of the paddle of a whale. Later on, he\r\nabandoned the idea that it once belonged to a whale, and it was\r\nthought that the extinct animal in question might have been a reptile\r\nof the crocodilean order. In time, a fine series of limb-bones and\r\nvertebræ was added to the Oxford Museum by Professor Phillips (Dr.\r\nBuckland's successor at Oxford), who pronounced them to be\r\nDinosaurian. The name \"Cetiosaurus\"[11] (or Whale-lizard), originally\r\ngiven by Owen, was unfortunate, because there is really nothing\r\nwhale-like about it, except a certain coarse texture of some of the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n[11] Greek--_ketion_, whale; _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Dr. Buckland announced the discovery of another limb-bone (a\r\nfemur), which Owen referred to Cetiosaurus; it was four feet three\r\ninches in length. Between 1868 and 1870, however, a considerable\r\nportion of a skeleton was discovered in the same formation at\r\nKirtlington Station, near Oxford. These remains were the subject of\r\ncareful examination by Professors Owen and Phillips. The femur this\r\ntime was five feet four inches long. Their studies threw much light on\r\nthe nature and habits of Cetiosaurus.\r\n\r\nAlthough showing in many ways an approach to the crocodile type of\r\nreptile, yet it was perceived from the nature of the limbs that they\r\nwere better fitted for walking on land than are those of a crocodile,\r\nwith its sprawling limbs. Still, Professor Owen was careful to point\r\nout that the vertebræ of its long tail indicate suitability as a\r\npowerful swimming organ, and concluded that the creature was more\r\naquatic than terrestrial in its habits. Plaster casts of the\r\nlimb-bones may be seen at the British Museum of Natural History, side\r\nby side with the huge Atlantosaurus cast sent by Professor Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe Kimmeridge clay of Weymouth has yielded a huge arm-bone (or\r\nhumerus), nearly five feet long; and from Wealden strata of Sussex and\r\nthe Isle of Wight vertebræ have been collected. Altogether we have\r\nremains of Cetiosaurus from at least half a dozen counties.\r\nUnfortunately, no specimen of a skull has yet been found, and only two\r\nor three small and incomplete teeth, which may possibly have belonged\r\nto some other animal. Professor Owen estimated the length of the trunk\r\nand tail of the creature to have been thirty-five or thirty-six feet;\r\nbut in the absence of further evidence it was not possible to form any\r\nconclusion as to its total length. It is evident that Cetiosaurus was\r\nclosely allied to the American Brontosaurus (p. 69); and so these\r\nearlier English discoveries have gained much in interest from the\r\nlight thrown upon them by Professor Marsh's huge Saurian.\r\n\r\nAnother English Saurian of this group was the Ornithopsis, from\r\nWealden strata in the Isle of Wight, which has been the subject of\r\ncareful study by Mr. Hulke and Professor Seeley. Their conclusions,\r\nbased on the examination of separate portions of the skeleton (such as\r\nvertebræ), have been singularly confirmed by the discovery of\r\nBrontosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn Ornithopsis the vertebræ of the neck and back, though of great\r\nsize, were remarkably light, and yet of great strength. One of the\r\nvertebræ of the back had a body, or centrum, ten inches long.\r\nHoplosaurus and Pelosaurus were evidently reptiles closely allied to\r\nthe above types; but at present are so imperfectly known that we need\r\nnot consider them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDINOSAURS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n     \"Fossils have been eloquently and appropriately termed\r\n     'Medals of Creation.'\"--Dr. Mantell.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen any tribe of plants or animals becomes very flourishing, and\r\nspreads over the face of the earth, occupying regions far apart from\r\none another, where the geographical and other conditions, such as\r\nclimate, are unlike, its members will inevitably develop considerable\r\ndifferences among themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the great Mesozoic period, Dinosaurs spread over a large part\r\nof the world; they became very numerous and powerful. Just as the\r\nbirds and beasts (quadrupeds) of to-day show an almost endless\r\nvariety, according to the circumstances in which they are placed, so\r\nthat great and powerful order of reptiles we are now considering ran\r\nriot, and gave rise to a variety of forms, or types. Those described\r\nin the last chapter were heavy, slow-moving Dinosaurs, of great\r\nproportions, and were all herbivorous creatures, apparently without\r\nweapons of offence or defence.\r\n\r\nThe group Theropoda, or \"beast-footed\" Dinosaurs, that partly form the\r\nsubject of the present chapter, were all flesh-eating animals; and, as\r\nwe shall discover from their fossilised remains, were of less size,\r\nand led active lives. In fact, they acted in their day the part played\r\nby lions and tigers to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1824 that keen observer and original thinker, the Rev. Dr.\r\nBuckland, described to the Geological Society of London some remains\r\nof a very strange and formidable reptile found in the Limestone of\r\nStonesfield, near Woodstock (about twelve miles from Oxford). This\r\nrock, known as \"Stonesfield slate\" from its property of splitting up\r\ninto thin layers, has long been celebrated for its fossil remains, and\r\nfrom it have also been obtained the bones of some early mammals. It is\r\na member of the Lower Oolitic group.\r\n\r\nThe portions of skeleton originally discovered consisted of part of a\r\nlower jaw, with teeth, a thigh bone (femur), a series of vertebræ of\r\nthe trunk, a few ribs, and some other fragments. The name\r\nMegalosaurus,[12] or \"great lizard,\" suggested itself both to Dr.\r\nBuckland and Baron Cuvier, because it was evident from the size of the\r\nbones that the creature must have been very big. It is true these\r\nbones were not found together in one spot; but Professor Owen came to\r\nthe conclusion that they all belonged to the same species.\r\n\r\n[12] Greek--_megas_, great; _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nNo entire skeleton of the Megalosaur has ever been found, but there\r\nwas enough material to enable Dr. Buckland, Professor Owen, and\r\nProfessor Phillips to form a very fair idea of its general structure.\r\nIt should be mentioned here that Dr. Mantell, the enthusiastic\r\ngeologist to whose labours palæontologists are greatly indebted, had\r\npreviously discovered similar teeth and bones in the Wealden strata of\r\nTilgate Forest. Sherborne, in Dorset, is another locality which has\r\nyielded a fine specimen of parts of both jaws with teeth. A cast of\r\nthis may be seen in the geological collection at South Kensington. It\r\nwas found in the Inferior Oolite (Wall-case IV.); the original\r\nspecimen lies in the museum of Sherborne College. Remains of\r\nMegalosaurus have also been found at the following places: Lyme-Regis\r\nand Watchet (in the Lias); near Bridport (in Inferior Oolite); Enslow\r\nBridge (upper part of the Great Oolite and Forest Marble Beds);\r\nWeymouth (in Oxford Clay); Cowley and Dry Sandford (in the Coral Rag);\r\nMalton in Yorkshire (in Coralline Oolite); also in Normandy. They have\r\nalso been found in Wealden strata.\r\n\r\nThe portion of a lower jaw in the Oxford Museum is twelve inches long,\r\nwith a row of nine teeth, or sockets for teeth. The structure of the\r\nteeth leaves no doubt as to the carnivorous habits of the creature.\r\nWith a length of perhaps thirty feet, capable of free and rapid\r\nmovement on land, with strong hind limbs, short head, with long\r\npointed teeth, and formidable claws to its feet, the Megalosaur must\r\nhave been without a rival among the carnivorous reptiles on this side\r\nof the world. It probably walked for the most part on its hind legs,\r\nas depicted in our illustration, and Professors Huxley and Owen, on\r\nexamining the bones in the Oxford Museum, were much impressed with the\r\nbird-like character of some parts of the skeleton, showing an approach\r\nto the ostrich type. The form of the teeth, as pointed out by Dr.\r\nBuckland, exhibits a remarkable combination of contrivances. When\r\nyoung and first protruding above the gum, the apex of the tooth\r\npresented a double cutting edge of serrated enamel; but as it advanced\r\nin growth its direction was turned backwards in the form of a pruning\r\nknife, and the enamelled sawing edge was continued downwards to the\r\nbase of the inner and cutting side, but became thicker on the other\r\nside, obtaining additional strength when it was no longer needed as a\r\ncutting instrument (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Lower jaw-bone of Megalosaurus, with teeth.]\r\n\r\nThe genus Megalosaurus--now rendered classic through the labours of\r\nProfessors Buckland, Phillips, and Owen--may be regarded as the type\r\nof the carnivorous Dinosaurs; and it affords an excellent and\r\ninstructive instance of the gradual restoration of the skeleton of a\r\nnew monster from more or less fragmentary remains. Certain very\r\nexcusable errors were at first made in the restoration, but these\r\nhave since been rectified by a comparison with the allied American\r\nforms, such as Allosaurus, of which nearly entire skeletons have of\r\nlate been discovered in strata of Jurassic age--in fact, the same rock\r\nin Colorado as that in which the huge Atlantosaurus bones lay hid. The\r\naccompanying woodcut (Fig. 13) shows how the skeleton has been\r\nrestored in the light of these later discoveries of Professor Marsh.\r\nThe large bones of the limbs of these formidable flesh-eating monsters\r\nwere hollow, and many of the vertebræ, as well as some of those of the\r\nfeet, contained cavities, or were otherwise lightened in order to give\r\nthe creature a greater power of rapid movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Skeleton of Megalosaurus, restored. (After\r\nMeyer.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to imagine a Megalosaur lying in wait for his\r\nprey (perhaps a slender, harmless little mammal of the ant-eater type)\r\nwith his hind limbs bent under his body, so as to bring the heels to\r\nthe ground, and then with one terrific bound from those long legs\r\nspringing on to the prey, and holding the mammal tight in its clawed\r\nfore limbs, as a cat might hold a mouse. Then the sabre-like teeth\r\nwould be brought into action by the powerful jaws, and soon the flesh\r\nand bones of the victim would be gone! (See Plate VI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VI.\r\n\r\nA CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR, MEGALOSAURUS BUCKLANDI.\r\n\r\nLength about 25 feet.]\r\n\r\nAs we remarked before, the carnivorous Dinosaurs were the lions and\r\ntigers of the Mesozoic era, and, what with small mammals and numerous\r\nreptiles of those days, it would seem that they were not limited in\r\ntheir choice of diet.\r\n\r\nIt is a question not yet decided whether Dinosaurs laid eggs as most\r\nmodern reptiles do, or were viviparous like quadrupeds; but Professor\r\nMarsh thinks there are reasons for the latter supposition.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the Mesozoic era, at the period known as the\r\nTriassic (New Red Sandstone), Dinosaurs flourished vigorously in\r\nAmerica, developing a great variety of forms and sizes. Although but\r\nfew of their bones have as yet been discovered in those rocks, they\r\nhave left behind unmistakable evidence of their presence in the\r\nwell-known footprints and other impressions upon the shores of the\r\nwaters which they frequented.[13] The Triassic Sandstone of the\r\nConnecticut Valley has long been famous for its fossil footprints,\r\nespecially the so-called \"bird-tracks,\" which are generally supposed\r\nto have been made by birds, the tracks of which they certainly appear\r\nto resemble. But a careful investigation of nearly all the specimens\r\nyet discovered has convinced Professor Marsh that these fossil\r\nimpressions were not made by birds (see Fig. 14). Most of the\r\nthree-toed tracks, he thinks, were made by Dinosaurs, who usually\r\nwalked upon their hind feet alone, and only occasionally put to the\r\nground their small fore limbs. He has detected impressions of the\r\nlatter in connection with nearly all the larger tracks of the hind\r\nlimbs. These double impressions are just such as Dinosaurs would make;\r\nand, since the only characteristic bones yet found in the same rocks\r\nbelong to this order of reptiles, it is but fair to attribute all\r\nthese footprints to Dinosaurs, even where no impressions of fore feet\r\nhave been detected, _until_ some evidence of birds is forthcoming. The\r\nsize of some of these impressions, as well as the length of stride\r\nthey indicate, is against the idea of their having been made by birds.\r\nSome of them, for instance, are twenty inches in length, and four or\r\nfive feet apart! The foot of the African ostrich is but ten inches\r\nlong, so we must fall back on the Dinosaurs for an explanation.\r\nHowever, it is quite possible that some of the smaller impressions\r\nwere made by birds.\r\n\r\n[13] Since the above was written, Professor Marsh has described, in\r\n_The American Journal of Science_ for June, 1892, several more or less\r\ncomplete skeletons of Triassic Dinosaurs, lately found, and now in the\r\nYale College Museum. This is an important discovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Portion of a slab of New Red Sandstone, from\r\nTurner's Falls, Massachusetts, U.S., covered with numerous tracks,\r\nprobably of Dinosaurs. This specimen is now in the Natural History\r\nMuseum. The separate tracks are indicated by the numbers. (After\r\nHitchcock.)]\r\n\r\nThere is at South Kensington a fine series of these and other\r\nspecimens of fossil footprints (Gallery No. XI., Wall-cases 8-10). The\r\nsurface of one large slab in the geological collection is eight feet\r\nby six feet, and bears upwards of seventy distinct impressions\r\ndisposed in several tracks, as shown in Fig. 14. The lines were added\r\nby Dr. Hitchcock, who has published full descriptions in order to show\r\nthe direction and disposition of the tracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Portion of a slab, with tracks. (After\r\nHitchcock.)]\r\n\r\nIn a presidential address to the Geological Society, Sir Charles\r\nLyell, speaking of the Connecticut Sandstone and its impressions,\r\nsaid, \"When I first examined these strata of slate and sandstone near\r\nJersey City, in company with Mr. Redfield, I saw at once from the\r\nripple-marked surface of the slabs, from the casts of cracks, the\r\nmarks of rain-drops, and the embedded fragments of drift-wood, that\r\nthese beds had been formed precisely under circumstances most\r\nfavourable for the reception of impressions of the feet of animals\r\nwalking between high and low water. In the prolongation of the same\r\nbeds in the Valley of Connecticut, there have been found, according to\r\nProfessor Hitchcock, the footprints of no less than thirty-two species\r\nof bipeds, and twelve of quadrupeds. They have been observed in more\r\nthan twenty localities, which are scattered over an area of nearly\r\neighty miles from north to south, in the States of Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut. After visiting several of these places, I entertained no\r\ndoubt that the sand and mud were deposited on an area which was slowly\r\nsubsiding all the while, so that at some points a thickness of more\r\nthan a thousand feet of superimposed strata had accumulated in very\r\nshallow water, the footprints being repeated at various intervals on\r\nthe surface of the mud throughout the entire series of superimposed\r\nbeds.\" When Sir Charles Lyell first examined this region in 1842,\r\nProfessor Hitchcock had already seen two thousand impressions of feet!\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to imagine the conditions under which such\r\nimpressions may have been preserved, for at the present day there are\r\nto be seen, on some shores, illustrations of similar operations. Dr.\r\nGould, of Boston, U.S., was the first to call the attention of\r\nnaturalists to a very instructive example of such processes on the\r\nshores of the Bay of Fundy, where the tide is said to rise in some\r\nplaces seventy feet high. Here we have a very perfect surface for\r\nreceiving and retaining impressions. Vast are the numbers of wading\r\nand sea-birds that course to and fro over the extensive tract of\r\nplastic red surface left dry by the far retreat of the tide in the Bay\r\nof Fundy. During the period that elapses between one spring tide and\r\nthe next, the highest part of the tidal deposit is exposed long enough\r\nto receive and retain many impressions; even during the hours of hot\r\nsunshine, to which, in the summer months, this so-trodden tract is\r\nleft exposed, the layer last deposited becomes baked hard and dry, and\r\nbefore the returning tidal wave has power to break up the preceding\r\none, the impressions left on that stratum have received a deposit. A\r\ncast is thus taken of the mould previously made, and each succeeding\r\ntide brings another layer of deposit. We can easily imagine that in\r\nsucceeding ages the petrifying influences will consolidate the sandy\r\nlayers into a fossil rock. Such a rock would split in such a way,\r\nalong its natural layers of formation, as to show the old moulds on\r\none surface, and the casts on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Limb-bones of _Allosaurus_. (After Marsh.)\r\n\r\n1. Fore leg. 2. Hind leg.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh has had the good fortune to discover a very peculiar\r\nnew form of carnivorous Dinosaur, to which he has given the name\r\nCeratosaurus,[14] because its skull supported a horn. But the horn is\r\nnot the only new feature presented by this interesting creature. Its\r\nvertebræ are of a strange and unexpected type; and in the pelvis all\r\nthe bones are fused together, as in modern birds. Externally, also,\r\nthe Ceratosaurus differed from other members of the carnivorous group,\r\nfor its body was partly protected by long plates in the skin, such as\r\ncrocodiles have: these extended from the back of the head, along the\r\nneck, and over the back. An almost complete skeleton was found which\r\nindicates an animal about seventeen feet long. When alive it was\r\nprobably about half the bulk of the Allosaurus mentioned above. (See\r\nFig. 16.)\r\n\r\n[14] Greek--_keras_, horn; _sauros_, lizard. Some authorities consider\r\nit to be identical with Megalosaurus.\r\n\r\nSeen from above, its skull resembles in general outline that of a\r\ncrocodile, the facial portion being elongated and gradually tapering\r\nto the muzzle, with the nasal openings separate, and placed near the\r\nend of the snout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Skull of _Ceratosaurus_. Top view. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe teeth of this horned Dinosaur resemble those of the Megalosaur.\r\nIts eyes were protected by protuberances of the skull just above the\r\ncavity in which the eye was placed (see Figs. 17 and 18). The brain\r\nwas a good deal larger in proportion to the size of the animal than in\r\nBrontosaurus and its allies; so perhaps we may infer that it was\r\nendowed with greater intelligence, as it certainly was more active in\r\nits habits. The fore limbs, as in Megalosaurus, were small, and some\r\nof the fingers ended in powerful claws, which no doubt it used to good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable of all the Dinosaurs was a diminutive\r\ncreature only two feet in length, which was related to those we have\r\njust been considering, and whose skeleton has been found almost entire\r\nin the now famous Lithographic Stone of Solenhofen in Bavaria. Of this\r\nunique type, the Compsognathus, the skeleton of which is in many ways\r\nso bird-like, Professor Huxley remarks, \"It is impossible to look at\r\nthe conformation of this strange reptile and to doubt that it hopped,\r\nor walked, in an erect or semi-erect position, after the manner of a\r\nbird, to which its long neck, slight head, and small anterior limbs\r\nmust have given it an extraordinary resemblance.\" (See Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Skull of _Ceratosaurus nasicornis_. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nAt the head of this chapter are placed the words of Dr. Mantell,\r\n\"Fossils have been eloquently and appropriately termed _Medals of\r\nCreation_,\" and the eloquent passage by which those words are followed\r\nmay be transcribed here. He goes on to say, \"For as an accomplished\r\nnumismatist, even when the inscription of an ancient and unknown coin\r\nis illegible, can from the half-obliterated effigy, and from the style\r\nof art, determine with precision the people by whom, and the period\r\nwhen, it was struck: in like manner the geologist can decipher these\r\nnatural memorials, interpret the hieroglyphics with which they are\r\ninscribed, and from apparently the most insignificant relics trace the\r\nhistory of beings of whom no other records are extant, and ascertain\r\nthe forms and habits of unknown types of organisation whose races are\r\nswept from the face of the earth, ere the creation of man, and the\r\ncreatures which are his contemporaries. Well might the illustrious\r\nBergman exclaim, \"_Sunt instar nummorum memoralium quæ de præteritis\r\nglobi nostri fatis testantur, ubi omnia silent monumenta historica._\"\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Skeleton of _Compsognathus longipes_. (From\r\nthe Solenhofen limestone.)]\r\n\r\nGeology owes a deep debt of gratitude to the late Dr. Gideon A.\r\nMantell, who, during the intervals of a laborious professional life,\r\ncollected and described the remains of several strange extinct\r\nreptiles, and wrote a number of works on geology, such as served in\r\nhis day to advance the science to which he was so enthusiastically\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\nWe propose to give a brief account of a wonderful group of Dinosaurs,\r\nfirst introduced to the scientific world through Dr. Mantell's\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThe first of these monsters is the Iguanodon, the earliest known\r\nindividual of the \"bird-footed\" division (Ornithopoda). The history of\r\nthe gradual reconstruction of its skeleton is an instructive instance\r\nof the results that may be obtained by a careful and patient study of\r\nfragmentary remains. Through the labours of Dr. Mantell, in the first\r\nhalf of this century, a considerable knowledge was acquired of the\r\ngreater part of the skeleton, but certain portions remained a puzzle;\r\nthese, however, were eventually explained by Professor Huxley and Mr.\r\nHulke, and a few years ago a series of complete skeletons were most\r\nfortunately obtained in Belgium, so that now every part of the huge\r\nframework of this monster is known to the palæontologist. Its history,\r\nas a fossil, is a most interesting one, and furnishes one more example\r\nof the marvellous insight into the nature of extinct animals displayed\r\nby the illustrious Baron Cuvier. Let us begin with the teeth, since\r\nthey were the first part of the monster brought to light.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, hardly necessary to remark that, to one thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the structures of living animals, a tooth, or a series\r\nof teeth, will furnish material from which important conclusions with\r\nregard to the structure and habits of an extinct animal may be drawn.\r\nSo, also, with regard to some other parts, such as limb-bones, but\r\nmore especially the bones of which the backbone is composed (known as\r\nvertebræ). These are very important. The veteran anatomist, Professor\r\nOwen, has said, \"If I were restricted to a single specimen on which to\r\ndeduce the nature of an extinct animal, I should choose a vertebra to\r\nwork out a reptile, and a tooth in the case of a mammal.\" Seven or\r\neight different \"characters,\" he says, may be deduced from a reptilian\r\nvertebra. It is, of course, impossible for any one to reconstruct an\r\nentire animal from a single bone or a few teeth, yet such fragments\r\nindicate in a general way the nature of a lost creation and its\r\nposition in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Tooth of Iguanodon, with the apex slightly\r\nworn. (From the Wealden Beds of Tilgate Forest. Natural size.) 1.\r\nFront aspect, showing the longitudinal ridges and serrated margins of\r\nthe crown. 2. View of the back, or inner surface of the tooth. _a._\r\nSerrated margins. _b._ Apex of the crown worn by use.]\r\n\r\nIt is all the more important to give to the general reader this\r\nwarning, because an impression seems still to remain in the popular\r\nmind that Owen could and did restore extinct types from a single bone\r\nor a single tooth; but no anatomist would attribute to any mortal man\r\nsuch superhuman power. Let us, therefore, while gratefully\r\nacknowledging the debt we all owe to the great naturalist--who has\r\ngone to his rest since our first edition appeared--not attribute to\r\nhim impossible things. Nor can it be denied that even he sometimes\r\nfell into error, or drew conclusions not borne out by later\r\ndiscoveries. It must also be confessed that in some respects he lagged\r\nbehind in the march of scientific progress. While on this subject we\r\ncannot do better than quote some remarks of our friend, Mr. A. Smith\r\nWoodward, of the Natural History Museum, in an able review of Sir\r\nRichard's work on vertebrates.[15] He says, \"Owen, in fact, was\r\nCuvier's direct successor, and, apart from his striking hypotheses\r\n..., it is in this character that he has left the deepest impression\r\nupon biological science. Extending and elaborating comparative anatomy\r\nas understood by Cuvier, Owen concentrated his efforts on utilising\r\nthe results for the interpretation of the fossil remains--even\r\nisolated bones and teeth--of extinct animals. He never hesitated to\r\ndeal with the most fragmentary evidence, having complete faith in the\r\nprinciples established by Cuvier; and it is particularly interesting,\r\nin the light of present knowledge, to study the long series of\r\nsuccesses and failures that characterise his work. However,\r\nunwittingly, Owen may be said to have contributed most to the\r\ndemolition of the narrow Cuvierian views. When dealing with animals\r\nclosely related to those now living, his correctness of interpretation\r\nwas usually assured; when treating of more remote types, he could do\r\nlittle more than guess, unless tolerably complete skeletons happened\r\nto be at his disposal....\r\n\r\n\"In short, Owen's work on fragmentary fossils has demonstrated that\r\nthe principles of comparative anatomy are very different from those\r\ninferred by Cuvier from his limited field of observation, and the\r\ndiscoveries of Leidy, Marsh, Cope, Scott, and Osborn, in America, have\r\nfinally led to a new era that Owen only began to foresee clearly in\r\nhis later days.\"\r\n\r\n[15] _Natural Science_, ii. p. 130. (Feb. 1893.)\r\n\r\nThe first specimens of teeth of the Iguanodon were found by Mrs.\r\nMantell, in 1822, in the coarse conglomerate of certain strata in\r\nTilgate Forest, belonging to the Cretaceous period (see Table of\r\nStrata, Appendix I.). Dr. and Mrs. Mantell subsequently collected a\r\nmost interesting series of these remarkable teeth (which, for a time,\r\npuzzled the most learned men of the day), from the perfect tooth of a\r\nyoung animal, to the last stage, that of a mere long stump worn away\r\nby mastication. In external form they bore a striking resemblance to\r\nthe grinders of herbivorous mammals, and were wholly unlike any that\r\nhad previously been known. Even the quarrymen, accustomed to collect\r\nthe remains of fishes, shells, and other objects embedded in the\r\nrocks, had not observed fossils of this kind; and until Dr. Mantell\r\nshowed them his specimens, were not aware of the presence of such\r\nteeth in the stone they were constantly breaking up for the roads. The\r\nfirst specimen that arrested his attention was a large tooth, which,\r\nfrom the worn surface of its crown, had evidently once belonged to\r\nsome herbivorous animal. In form it so entirely resembled the\r\ncorresponding part of an incisor tooth of a large pachydermatous\r\nanimal ground down by use, that Dr. Mantell was much embarrassed to\r\naccount for its presence in the ancient Wealden strata, in which,\r\naccording to all previous experience, no fossil remains of mammals\r\nwould be likely to occur. No reptiles of the present day are capable\r\nof masticating their food; how, then, could he venture to assign it to\r\na reptile? Here was a puzzle to be solved, and in his perplexity he\r\ndetermined to try whether the great naturalist at Paris would be able\r\nto throw any light on the question. Through Sir Charles (then Mr.)\r\nLyell, this perplexing tooth was submitted to Baron Cuvier; and great\r\nwas the doctor's astonishment on hearing that it had been without\r\nhesitation pronounced to be the upper incisor of a rhinoceros! The\r\nsame tooth, with some other specimens, had already been exhibited at a\r\nmeeting of the Geological Society, and shown to Dr. Buckland, Mr.\r\nConybeare, and others, but with no more satisfactory result. Worse\r\nthan that: Dr. Mantell was told that the teeth were of no particular\r\ninterest, and that, without doubt, they either belonged to some large\r\nfish, or were the teeth of a mammal, and derived from some superficial\r\ndeposit of the \"glacial drift,\" then called Diluvium.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, however, who foresaw the importance of Mantell's\r\ndiscovery, and that was Dr. Wollaston. This distinguished philosopher,\r\nthough not a naturalist, supported the doctor's idea that the teeth\r\nbelonged to an unknown herbivorous reptile, and encouraged him to\r\ncontinue his researches.\r\n\r\nAs if to add to the difficulty of solving the enigma, certain bones of\r\nthe fore limb, discovered soon after in the same quarry and forwarded\r\nto Paris, were declared to belong to a species of hippopotamus!\r\nAnother very curious bone--of which we shall speak presently--was\r\ndeclared to be the lesser horn of a rhinoceros! The famous Dr.\r\nBuckland even went so far as to warn Dr. Mantell not to publish it\r\nforth that these bones and teeth had been found in the Tilgate Forest\r\nstrata. To him it seemed incredible that such remains could have been\r\nobtained from beds older than the superficial drift deposits of the\r\ndistrict. We must bear in mind that in those days palæontology, or the\r\nknowledge of the world's former inhabitants, was a new science still\r\nin its infancy, and the idea of mammals having existed so far back as\r\nthe Cretaceous period must have appeared incredible.\r\n\r\nHowever, the workmen in the quarry were stimulated by suitable\r\nrewards, and at length the doctor's efforts resulted in the discovery\r\nof teeth which displayed the curious serrated edges, and the entire\r\nform of the unused crown. Having forwarded specimens and drawings of\r\nthese to Paris, Dr. Mantell went to London, and ransacked all the\r\ndrawers in the Hunterian Museum that contained jaws and teeth of\r\nreptiles, but without finding any that threw light on this subject.\r\nFortunately, Mr. Samuel Stuchbury, then a young man, was present, and\r\nproposed to show him the skeleton of an Iguana, which he had himself\r\nprepared from a specimen that had long been immersed in spirits. And\r\nnow the puzzle was in a fair way to being solved; for, to his great\r\ndelight, the doctor found that the minute teeth of that reptile bore a\r\ncloser resemblance in their general form to those from Tilgate Forest\r\nthan any others he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this fortunate discovery, however, others remained\r\nobstinate and unconvinced; and it was not until he had collected a\r\nseries of specimens, exhibiting various stages of the teeth, that the\r\ncorrectness of his opinion was admitted, either as to their true\r\ninterpretation, or the age of the strata in which they were imbedded.\r\nAnd now there came good news from Paris. Cuvier, with the fresh\r\nmaterial submitted to him, had boldly renounced his previous opinion,\r\nand gave the weight of his great authority to the view maintained by\r\nthe discoverer of these teeth. In a letter to the doctor he said that\r\nsuch teeth were quite unknown to him, and that they belonged to some\r\nreptile. He suggested that they implied the existence of a _new\r\nanimal_, a _herbivorous reptile_. Time would either confirm or\r\ndisprove the idea, and in the mean time he advised Dr. Mantell to seek\r\ndiligently for further evidence, and, if part of a jaw could be found\r\nwith teeth adhering, he believed he could solve the problem. In his\r\nimmortal work, _Ossemens Fossiles_, Cuvier generously admits his\r\nformer mistake, and said he was entirely convinced of his error.\r\n\r\nBaron Cuvier alone amongst the doctor's friends or correspondents was\r\nable to give any hint as to the character and probable relations of\r\nthe animal to which the recently discovered teeth belonged. Being\r\nhampered by arduous professional duties in a provincial town, remote\r\nfrom museums and libraries, Dr. Mantell transmitted to the Royal\r\nSociety figures and drawings of the specimens, and, at the suggestion\r\nof the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, adopted the name Iguanodon (Iguana-tooth)\r\nfor the extinct reptile, a name which pointed to the resemblance of\r\nits teeth to those of the modern iguana, a land-lizard inhabiting many\r\nparts of America and the West Indies, and rarely met with north or\r\nsouth of the tropics. These lizards are from three to five feet in\r\nlength, and perfectly harmless, feeding on insects and vegetables, and\r\nclimbing trees in quest of the tender leaves and buds, which they chip\r\noff and swallow whole; they nestle in the hollows of rocks, and\r\ndeposit their eggs in the sands and banks of rivers.\r\n\r\nIn all living reptiles the insects or vegetables on which they feed\r\nare seized by the tongue or teeth, and swallowed whole, so that a\r\nmovable covering to the jaws, similar to the lips and cheeks of the\r\nmammalia, is not necessary, either for seizing and retaining food, or\r\nfor subjecting it by muscular movements to the action of the teeth. It\r\nis the power of perfect mastication possessed by the Iguanodon that is\r\nso strange, for it implies a most remarkable approach in extinct\r\nreptiles to characters possessed now only by herbivorous mammalia,\r\nsuch as horses, cows, deer, etc. From this and other strange\r\ncharacters seen in the Dinosaurs, we learn that they in their day\r\nplayed the part of our modern quadrupeds, whether carnivorous or\r\nherbivorous, and showed a remarkable approach to the mammalian type,\r\nwhich of course is a much higher one.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not to be wondered at that Dr. Mantell's\r\ncontemporaries, with the exception of Cuvier, found in the teeth we\r\nhave described an awkward puzzle, and refused to believe that they\r\nbelonged to a reptile. Such a notion was at variance with all previous\r\nexperience, and we naturally form our conclusions to a large extent by\r\nexperience. Let us, then, beware lest we allow our ideas to be limited\r\nby what after all is, as it were, only an expression of our ignorance.\r\nThe Hottentot who has never seen snow would refuse to believe that\r\nrain can assume a solid form; and, in the same way, if we bind\r\nourselves down by experience, we might refuse to believe in some of\r\nthe still more wonderful dinosaurian types to be described in this\r\nchapter, such as the Triceratops, with a pair of large horns, a skull\r\nover six feet long, and limbs larger than those of the rhinoceros!\r\n(see p. 117).\r\n\r\nThe strange vagaries of Dinosaurs have led Professor Marsh and other\r\nauthorities to exalt them, from their former position of a mere order\r\nin the reptile class, to the dignity of a sub-class all to themselves;\r\nand there is much to be said for this view. Compared with the\r\nMarsupials, living and extinct, they show an equal diversity of\r\nstructure and variations in size from by far the largest land animals\r\nknown down to some of the smallest.[16]\r\n\r\n[16] Bauer, after a full critical examination of the Dinosauria,\r\nconsiders that one order is insufficient, and has proposed to make\r\nthree orders of them, which he names after the Iguanodon, Cetiosaurus,\r\nand Megalosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe importance of discovering, if possible, a portion of the jaw of an\r\nIguanodon was fully recognised by Dr. Mantell, and, urged on by the\r\nencouragement he had received from the illustrious Cuvier, he eagerly\r\nsought for the required evidence. But nearly a quarter of a century\r\nelapsed before it was forthcoming. In 1841 and 1848, however, portions\r\nof the lower jaw, with some teeth attached, were found; and his memoir\r\n_On the Structure of the Jaws and Teeth of the Iguanodon_ was\r\npublished by the Royal Society in 1848. For this important\r\ncommunication the gold medal of the society was awarded to the author.\r\nThe second of these finds (by Captain Brickenden) confirmed in every\r\nessential particular the inferences suggested by the detached teeth.\r\n\r\nThe first important connected series of bones of this monster was\r\ndiscovered in 1834, by Mr. Bensted, in the \"Kentish Rag\" quarries of\r\nthe Lower Greensand formation at Maidstone. Mr. Bensted, who was the\r\nproprietor of the quarry, one day had his attention drawn by the\r\nworkmen to what they supposed to be petrified wood in some pieces of\r\nstone which they had been blasting. He perceived that what they\r\nsupposed to be wood was fossil bone, and, with a zeal and care which\r\nhave always characterised this estimable man (says Professor Owen) in\r\nhis endeavour to secure for science any evidence of fossil remains in\r\nhis quarry, he immediately resorted to the spot. He found that the\r\nbore, or blast, by which these remains were brought to light had been\r\ninserted into the centre of the specimen, so that the mass of stone\r\ncontaining it had been shattered into many pieces, some of which were\r\nblown into the adjoining fields! All these pieces he had carefully\r\ncollected, and, proceeding with equal ardour and success to the\r\nremoval of the matrix from the fossils, he succeeded, after a month's\r\nlabour, in exposing them to view, and in fitting the fragments in\r\ntheir proper place. This valuable specimen was presented to Dr.\r\nMantell (and afterwards purchased with the rest of his collection by\r\nthe British Museum), and its present condition is the result of his\r\nskill, as well as that of its discoverer. Certain gentlemen in\r\nBrighton, anxious that the specimen should be placed in the hands of\r\nthe original discoverer of Iguanodon, purchased and presented it to\r\nDr. Mantell--a tribute of respect which was highly gratifying to him.\r\n(Wall-case 6.)\r\n\r\nIt belonged to a young Iguanodon. This fortunate discovery was one of\r\nthose Cuvier foresaw, and has served to verify his sagacious\r\nconjecture that some of the great bones collected by the doctor from\r\nthe Wealden strata of Sussex belonged to the same animal, and to\r\nconfirm other conclusions formed by the discoverer of the Iguanodon.\r\nGreat was Dr. Mantell's delight on finding that every bone he had\r\nascribed to Iguanodon solely from analogy was present in the Maidstone\r\nspecimen. One of the chief advantages of this discovery was that it\r\nafforded demonstration of the characters of the vertebræ, which, as\r\npreviously stated, are very important to the anatomist. Of these\r\nProfessor Owen has given full descriptions, and has shown that they\r\ndiffer from those of any animal previously known, whether living or\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting, in the light of recent discoveries, to read\r\nthe conclusions arrived at by Mantell and Owen, with regard to the\r\norganisation of this great Wealden reptile, and to see how, with the\r\nexception of certain details, they have been confirmed. Considering\r\nthe imperfect nature of the materials at their command, it is\r\nwonderful that their forecasts should have turned out so successful.\r\nThus Professor Owen predicted for the Iguanodon a total length of\r\ntwenty-eight feet, and specimens discovered of late years show a\r\nlength of twenty-four feet. In some, the thigh-bone exceeded a yard in\r\nlength; this indicated an animal of great size, since in the largest\r\ncrocodiles this bone is scarcely a foot long. Again, Dr. Mantell, from\r\na study of the imperfect jaw-bones in his collection, concluded that\r\nthe lower jaw was invested with a well-developed fleshy flexible lip,\r\nand that the mouth was provided with a tongue of great mobility and\r\npower. \"There are strong reasons,\" he says, \"for supposing that the\r\nlip was flexible, and, in conjunction with the long fleshy prehensile\r\ntongue, constituted the instrument for seizing and cropping the leaves\r\nand branches, which, from the construction of the molars, we may\r\ninfer, constituted the chief food of the Iguanodon. The mechanism of\r\nthe maxillary organs (jaws), as elucidated by recent discoveries, is\r\nthus in perfect harmony with the remarkable characters which rendered\r\nthe first known teeth so enigmatical; and in the Wealden herbivorous\r\nreptile we have a solution of the problem, how the integrity of the\r\ntype of organisation peculiar to the class of cold-blooded vertebrata\r\nwas maintained, and yet adapted, by simple modifications, to fulfil\r\nthe conditions required by the economy of a gigantic terrestrial\r\nreptile, destined to obtain support exclusively from vegetable\r\nsubstances; in like manner, as the extinct colossal herbivorous\r\nEdentata (sloths, see Chapter XII.), which flourished in South America\r\nages after the country of the Iguanodon and its inhabitants had been\r\nswept away from the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mantell also was the first to prove, from the nature of the\r\nWealden strata, that they were deposited in or near the estuary of a\r\nmighty river. With regard to the aspect of the country in which the\r\nIguanodon flourished, he showed that coniferous trees probably clothed\r\nits Alpine regions; palms and arborescent ferns, and cycadaceous\r\nplants (_i.e._ plants resembling the modern zamia, or \"false palm\"),\r\nconstituted the groves and forests of its plains and valleys; and in\r\nits fens and marshes the equisetaceæ (mare's-tails) and plants of a\r\nlike nature prevailed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC DINOSAUR, IGUANODON BERNISSARTENSIS.\r\n\r\nLength about 30 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe Iguanodons of the Wealden epoch did not live and die where their\r\nbones are now found--the condition in which their fossil relics occur\r\nproves that they floated down the streams and rivers, with rafts of\r\ntrees and other spoils of the land, till, arrested in their course,\r\nthey sank down and became buried in the fluviatile and sometimes\r\nmarine sediments then being slowly laid down. In this way only can we\r\naccount for the generally broken and rolled condition of the bones,\r\ntheir separation from each other, the numerous specimens of teeth\r\nwhich must have been detached from their sockets, and the broken stems\r\nand branches of trees without leaves that have been found in the\r\nWealden strata of England.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Dr. Mantell, the remains of Iguanodon, or closely\r\nallied genera, have been found on the continent, in other parts of\r\nEngland, and in North America, in strata of various ages, from the\r\nTrias or New Red Sandstone to the Chalk (see Table of Strata, Appendix\r\nI.). The American Hadrosaurus must have decidedly resembled the\r\nIguanodon.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful restoration by our artist (plate VII.) is based upon the\r\nBelgian specimens described in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDINOSAURS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n     \"Everything in Nature is engaged in writing its own history:\r\n     the planet and the pebble are attended by their shadows, the\r\n     rolling rock leaves its furrows on the mountain side, the\r\n     river its channel in the soil, the animal its bones in the\r\n     stratum, the fern and the leaf inscribe their modest epitaphs\r\n     on the coal, the falling drop sculptures its story on the\r\n     sand and on the stone,--not a footstep on the snow or on the\r\n     ground, but traces in characters more or less enduring the\r\n     record of its progress.\"--Emerson.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1878 was announced one of the most fortunate discoveries\r\nknown in the whole history of geological science--a discovery unique\r\nof its kind, and one which throws considerable light on the nature of\r\nthe monster first discovered by Dr. Mantell. In that year came the\r\ngood news that no less than twenty-three Iguanodons had been found in\r\nthe colliery of Bernissart, in Belgium, between Mons and Tournai, near\r\nthe French frontier. The coal-bearing rocks (coal-measures) of this\r\ncolliery, overlain by chalk and other deposits of later age, are\r\nfissured in many places by deep valleys or chasms more than 218 yards\r\ndeep. Though now filled up, they must at one time have been open\r\ngorges on an old land surface. Into one of these chasms were somehow\r\nprecipitated twenty-three Iguanodons, numbers of fish, a frog-like\r\nanimal, several species of turtles, crocodiles, and numerous ferns\r\nsimilar to those described by Mantell from the Weald. It it not easy\r\nto conjecture how this large and varied assemblage of animals came to\r\nbe collected together and entombed in this one place, but possibly\r\ntheir carcases were swept by some flood into the chasm in which the\r\nremains were discovered. They were buried in clay interstratified with\r\nsand, a fact which was interpreted in accordance with the above\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nM. de Pauw, the accomplished controller of the workshops in the Royal\r\nMuseum of Natural History at Brussels, spent three whole years in\r\nextracting this splendid series of fossils from the pit-shaft, the\r\nbones being brought up from a depth of rather more than 350 yards. But\r\nat the end of this time it was only the rough material that had been\r\ngot together, and every block containing bones requires a great deal\r\nof most careful labour before the bones in it are so exposed that they\r\ncan be properly studied. Out of the twenty-three specimens, fifteen\r\nhad, in the year 1883, been chiselled out, eight remaining to be\r\nworked at; and although five skilled workmen were then constantly at\r\nwork, progress was necessarily slow.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, that is after seven years, two huge entire skeletons had been\r\nset up in a great glass case in the Courtyard of the Museum at\r\nBrussels, and these exhibit with marvellous completeness the structure\r\nof the extinct monster.[17] The work reflects the highest credit on M.\r\nde Pauw;[18] and the director of the Bernissart Mining Company, M.\r\nFages, deserves the thanks of all scientific men for so liberally\r\naiding this important undertaking. These specimens illustrate the\r\nconclusion, previously arrived at by Professor Huxley, that Dinosaurs,\r\nas a group, occupy a position in the great chain of animal life\r\nintermediate between reptiles and birds. Indeed, it is the opinion of\r\nthis great authority, and of many naturalists of the present day, that\r\nwhenever future discoveries may reveal the ancestry of birds, it will\r\nbe found that they came from Dinosaurs, or that both originated from a\r\ncommon ancestor.\r\n\r\n[17] In August, 1892, Mr. Dollo wrote, in answer to inquiries from\r\nSouth Kensington, to say that five are already mounted and exhibited,\r\nand five more are almost ready for mounting. He also stated that the\r\nremains represent twenty-nine individuals, not twenty-three, as above.\r\n\r\n[18] _Geological Magazine_, January, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe specimens so skilfully set up by M. de Pauw represent two\r\ndistinct species. The larger one, Iguanodon Bernissartensis, cannot be\r\nless than fifteen feet high, and, measured from the tip of the snout\r\nto the end of the tail, is rather over thirty feet long, covering\r\nnearly twenty-four feet of ground in its erect position (see Fig. 21).\r\nIguanodon Mantelli is smaller and more slender looking, with a height\r\nof over ten feet, and a length of about twenty feet. (See Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Skeleton of _Iguanodon Bernissartensis_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VIII.\r\n\r\nIGUANODON MANTELLI.\r\n\r\nLength about 20 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Skull and skeleton of _Iguanodon Mantelli_.\r\n(From Bernissart.)]\r\n\r\nThe huge three-toed impressions found in Sussex prove that the\r\nmonster, although owning a body as large as that of an elephant,\r\nhabitually walked on its hind legs! Some of the thighbones found by\r\nDr. Mantell measured between four and five feet in length. It will be\r\nseen that the fore limbs are small in comparison to the hind limbs. A\r\nremarkable feature of the hand is the large pointed bone at the end of\r\nthe thumb, forming a kind of spur. The conical shape of this bone\r\nfound by Dr. Mantell, who had no clue to its place in the skeleton,\r\nled him to suppose that it was a horn answering to that of a\r\nrhinoceros--a conclusion which Professor Owen refused for various\r\nreasons to accept. The latter concluded that it belonged to the hand,\r\nand now we see that he was right. Unfortunately, certain popular works\r\non geology, such as _Our Earth and its Story_ (Cassell) still continue\r\nto spread this error, by showing a (very indifferent) restoration of\r\nthe Iguanodon with the impossible horn on its nose. It has been\r\nsuggested that the spur was a weapon of offence, and that, when\r\nattacked, an Iguanodon may have seized its aggressor in its short\r\narms, and made use of the spur as a dagger. But this is only\r\nconjecture, and perhaps the spur may have been useful in seizing and\r\npulling down the foliage and branches of trees, or in grubbing them up\r\nby the roots. Detached specimens of this curious bone may be seen\r\namong the other remains of Iguanodon at South Kensington, and also\r\nsome of the gigantic tracks already alluded to. (Gallery IV. on plan,\r\nWall-cases 5 and 6; and Gallery XI., Wall-case 7.)\r\n\r\nThe Bernissart specimens even afford some evidence as to the nature of\r\nthe integument, or skin, and this supports the idea previously held\r\nthat the creature possessed a smooth skin, or, at least, only slightly\r\nroughened. The muzzle was quite toothless, and perhaps may have been\r\nsheathed in horn, like the beak of turtles--an arrangement highly\r\nuseful for biting off the leaves of trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Tracks of _Iguanodon_, much reduced. (From\r\nWealden strata, Sussex.)]\r\n\r\nProbably it passed much of its time in the water, using its immense\r\npowerful tail as an organ of propulsion. When swimming slowly it may\r\nhave used both sets of limbs, but when going fast it probably fixed\r\nits fore limbs closely beside its body, and drove itself through the\r\nwater by means of the long hind limbs alone. Mr. Dollo, of Brussels,\r\nis preparing a final monograph on the Bernissart Iguanodons, a work to\r\nwhich palæontologists eagerly look forward. There cannot be much doubt\r\nthat these unarmoured Dinosaurs were molested and preyed upon by\r\ntheir carnivorous contemporaries, such as the fierce Megalosaurus,\r\npreviously described (p. 76). And with regard to this, Mr. Dollo makes\r\nthe suggestion that, when on land, their great height and erect\r\nposture enabled them to descry such enemies a long way off. Their\r\ngreat height must also have stood them in good stead, by enabling them\r\neasily to reach the leaves of trees, tree-ferns, cycads, and other\r\nforms of vegetable life, which constituted their daily food. (See\r\nrestorations, Plates VII. and VIII.)\r\n\r\nShould the reader visit the \"geological island\" in the grounds of the\r\nCrystal Palace, he will see that Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins's great model\r\nIguanodon there set up is by no means in accordance with the\r\ndescription given above; but we must remember how imperfect was the\r\nmaterial at his command.\r\n\r\nAnother Dinosaur, of considerable dimensions, that flourished during\r\nthe Wealden period was the Hylæosaurus, also discovered by Dr.\r\nMantell, and so named by him because it came from the Weald.[19] In the\r\nsummer of 1832, upon visiting a quarry in Tilgate Forest, which had\r\nyielded many organic remains, he perceived in some fragments of a\r\nlarge mass of stone which had recently been broken up and thrown in\r\nthe roadside, traces of numerous pieces of bone. With great care he\r\ncemented together and fixed in a stout frame, all the portions of this\r\nblock that he could find, and set to work to \"develop\" the block with\r\nhis chisel. This work occupied many weeks, but his labour was rewarded\r\nby the discovery of certain new and remarkable features displayed by\r\nthis monster; for it must have presented, when alive, a formidable\r\narray of bony plates and long sharp spines, the latter of which\r\nprobably stood in bristling array along the back and tail, and other\r\nparts of the body. (Wall-case 4.) Of the spines no less than ten were\r\nfound in this block, varying in length from five to seventeen inches,\r\nthe largest being four inches thick. It is known that many lizards,\r\nsuch as Iguanas and Cycluras, have large processes with horny\r\ncoverings, forming a kind of fringe or crest along the back, and,\r\njudging by analogy, Dr. Mantell concluded that this gigantic saurian\r\nwas similarly armed with a row of large angular spines covered by a\r\nthick horny investment. As weapons of offence and defence, they were\r\nno doubt highly effective, but their precise arrangement is still a\r\nmatter of speculation.\r\n\r\n[19] From Greek--_hule_, wood, or weald; and _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nThis first specimen displayed, besides the bony scutes and spines, a\r\nportion of the backbone, eleven ribs and portions of the pectoral\r\narch. A second specimen was found near Bolney, in Sussex, and was\r\nunfortunately almost wholly destroyed by the labourers; but Dr.\r\nMantell was able to obtain many of the bones, such as ribs and\r\nlimb-bones, and they also indicated a reptile of great size. A third\r\nspecimen was brought to light in Tilgate Forest in 1837; but,\r\nunfortunately, this also fell into the hands of the parish labourers,\r\nwho were unacquainted with its value. Although with due care a much\r\nlarger portion of the skeleton might have been kept, yet Dr. Mantell\r\nwas able to obtain a fine series of twenty-six vertebræ belonging to\r\nthe tail, with a total length of nearly six feet: the same spines were\r\npresent here also.\r\n\r\nNo specimen of the skull of this strange monster is known, and no\r\nteeth that can be with certainty referred to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse Hawkins's model at Sydenham, near the Iguanodon, was\r\nbased on the above discoveries, which are insufficient, and is far\r\nfrom the truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IX.\r\n\r\nAN ARMOURED DINOSAUR, SCELIDOSAURUS HARRISONI.\r\n\r\nLength 12 feet or more.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Restored skeleton of _Scelidosaurus\r\nHarrisoni_ (after Woodward), greatly reduced, from the Lower Lias of\r\nCharmouth, Dorset. The figure shows the large lateral dermal spines on\r\nthe shoulders, and the long lateral line of smaller spines, reaching\r\nfrom the pectoral region to the extremity of the tail.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next monster to be described is one that has fortunately left to\r\nposterity a much better record of itself, and probably was not very\r\nunlike the Hylæosaurus of Mantell. This is the Scelidosaurus: so named\r\nby Professor Owen from the indications of greater power in the hind\r\nlegs than in most saurians.[20] It is the only known example of an\r\nalmost entire skeleton of an English Dinosaur, and the history of its\r\ndiscovery is rather curious. Some time previous to 1861, Mr. J.\r\nHarrison, of Charmouth, obtained from the Lower Lias of that\r\nneighbourhood portions of the hind limb of a Dinosaur, and, later on,\r\na nearly complete skull. These specimens were described by Owen, and\r\nthe genus was founded on them. Mr. Harrison, whose discovery aroused\r\ngreat interest, continued to search on the same spot, and was rewarded\r\nby finding all the rest of the skeleton, except most of the neck\r\nvertebræ. This was extracted in several blocks, and these, after\r\ncareful \"development\" of the bones, were fitted together so as to\r\nexhibit the whole skeleton. This most valuable specimen can now be\r\nseen at South Kensington in a separate glass case, and is one of the\r\ntreasures of the unrivalled gallery of fossil reptiles. The case is\r\nplaced so that both sides of the specimen can be seen (Case Y, Gallery\r\nIV., on plan). Its length is about twelve feet; perhaps the\r\nindividual it represents was not fully grown, but, on account of the\r\nabsence of most of the neck vertebræ, it is impossible to give the\r\nexact length. Both hind limbs are entire and well seen, but of the\r\nfore limbs the hands are wanting. The former were provided with four\r\n\"functional\" toes--that is, toes that were used,--and one\r\n\"rudimentary\" or unused one. There were two big spines, one placed on\r\neach shoulder, and a series of long plates arranged in lines along the\r\nback and side. Plate IX. shows an attempted restoration of this\r\nremarkable Dinosaur based upon the skeleton just described. It seems\r\nto have been organised for a terrestrial rather than an aquatic life,\r\nbut to have been amphibious, frequenting the margins of rivers or\r\nlakes. Professor Owen considers that the carcase of this individual\r\ndrifted down a river emptying itself in the old Liassic Sea, on the\r\nmuddy bottom of which it would settle down when the skin had been so\r\nfar decomposed as to permit the escape of gases due to decomposition.\r\nIn that case the carcase would attract large carnivorous fishes and\r\nreptiles, such as swarmed in this old sea, so that portions of the\r\nskin and flesh would probably be torn away before the weight of the\r\nbones had completely buried it in mud. In this way, perhaps, the loss\r\nof much of the external armature and of the two fore feet may be\r\naccounted for. The hind limbs, being stronger, were better able to\r\nresist such attacks, and they are therefore preserved. Like many other\r\nspecimens, this fossil has, in the course of ages, been subjected to\r\nenormous pressure from overlying strata, causing compression and\r\ndislocation or fracture.\r\n\r\n[20] From Greek--_scelis_, limb, and _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nBut there were in existence during the long Jurassic period, other and\r\neven stranger forms of armoured Dinosaurs. One of these, only\r\nimperfectly known at present, was the many-spined Polacanthus.[21] This\r\nremarkable monster had the whole region of the loins and haunches\r\nprotected by a continuous sheet of bony plate armour, rising into\r\nknobs and spines, after the fashion of the shield or carapace of\r\ncertain extinct armadillos known as Glyptodonts (see Chapter XII.). A\r\nspecimen of such a shield is to be seen in the collection at South\r\nKensington (Wall-case 4). It is to be hoped that, some day, further\r\nremains of the Polacanthus will be brought to light, so that a\r\nrestoration may become possible. Dr. Mantell had already pointed out\r\ncertain analogies between Iguanodon and the huge extinct sloths of the\r\nSouth American continent, that flourished in the much more recent\r\nPleistocene period; and this idea is now considerably strengthened by\r\nthe later discoveries of armoured Dinosaurs. These are his words: \"In\r\nfine, we have in the Iguanodon the type of the terrestrial herbivora\r\nwhich, in the remote epoch of the earth's physical history termed by\r\ngeologists _the age of Reptiles_, occupied the same relative position\r\nin the scale of being, and fulfilled the same general purposes in the\r\neconomy of nature, as the Mastodons, Mammoths, and Mylodons (extinct\r\nsloths) of the Tertiary period, and the existing pachyderms.\"\r\n\r\n[21] From Greek--_polus_, many, and _acantha_, spine.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, one of the most interesting discoveries of modern\r\ngeology, that certain races of animals now extinct have in various\r\nways assumed some of the characteristics presented by animals much\r\nhigher in the scale of being, that flourish in the present day. It\r\nseems as if there had been some strange law of anticipation at work,\r\nif we may venture so to formulate the idea. It has already been shown\r\nhow the great saurians Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus presumed to put\r\non some of the characters of whales, and to play their _rôle_ in\r\nnature, though they were only reptiles; how the carnivorous Dinosaurs\r\nacquired teeth like those now possessed by lions and tigers, which\r\nalso are mammals; and now we find herbivorous Dinosaurs imitating the\r\nGlyptodon, an armadillo that lived in South America almost down to the\r\nhuman period. We shall not lose sight of this very interesting and\r\ncurious discovery, for other cases will present themselves to our view\r\nin future chapters. The reader might ask, \"If reptiles were able in\r\nthese and other ways to imitate the mammals of to-day, or of\r\nyesterday, why should they not have been able to go a few steps\r\nfurther, and actually _become_ mammals?\" The Evolutionist, if\r\nconfronted with such a question, would say, that there is no evidence\r\nof Dinosaurs turning into mammals, but that both may have branched off\r\nat an early geological period (say the Permian) from a primitive group\r\nof reptiles, or even of amphibians.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that, during the \"age of reptiles\" (Mesozoic\r\nperiod), the mammalian type was but feebly represented by certain\r\nsmall and humble forms, probably marsupials. As far as we know, there\r\nwere no big quadrupeds such as flourish to-day; therefore reptiles\r\nplayed their part, and in so doing acquired some of their habits and\r\nstructural peculiarities. It is difficult for us, living in an age of\r\nquadrupeds, to realise this, and to picture to ourselves reptilian\r\ntypes posing as \"lords of creation,\" or, to use a homely phrase,\r\n\"strutting in peacock's feathers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving now the English herbivorous Dinosaurs, we pass on to those\r\nstill more wonderful forms discovered of late years by Professor\r\nMarsh. The former have been treated at considerable length, first\r\nbecause they are English, and, as such, the history of their discovery\r\npossesses considerable interest; secondly, because their elucidation\r\nreflects the highest credit on our great pioneers in this fruitful\r\nfield of research, and illustrates the manner in which great\r\nnaturalists have been able to draw most important and wonderful\r\nconclusions (afterwards verified in most cases) from material\r\napparently far from promising. For example, Cuvier's prophecy of the\r\nIguanodon from a few teeth is a striking example of the result of\r\nreasoning from the known to the unknown, an example which seems to us\r\nworthy to be ranked with the discovery of Neptune by Adams and\r\nLeverrier, or, to take a more recent case, the discovery by Mendeleef\r\nof the Periodic Law, by means of which he has foretold the discovery\r\nof new chemical elements.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the origin of the great mammalian class, the\r\npossibility and even probability of birds and Dinosaurs being\r\ndescended from a common ancestor is a theory for which much may be\r\nsaid, and it has been adopted by many leading naturalists of the\r\npresent day, who have been convinced by Professor Huxley's clear\r\nelucidation of the nature of the pelvic region in the group of\r\nDinosaurs which has been above described (the Ornithopoda, or\r\nbird-footed group). It was Professor Huxley who first propounded this\r\ninteresting speculation, basing his belief on the many bird-like\r\ncharacters presented by this strange group of extinct reptiles--the\r\nsmall head and fore limbs, the long and often three-toed hollow hind\r\nlimbs, the bones of the pelvis or haunch, their habit of walking in a\r\nsemi-erect position on those limbs (as proved by their tracks), and in\r\nsome of hopping, as the little Compsognathus most probably did. And,\r\nlast but not least, the strange mixture of bird-like and reptilian\r\ncharacters presented by certain most anomalous birds discovered by\r\nProfessor Marsh in American Cretaceous rocks, viz. the huge\r\nHesperornis and the smaller Ichthyornis. Speaking on this subject some\r\nyears ago, Professor Marsh said, \"It is now generally admitted by\r\nbiologists who have made a study of vertebrates, that birds have come\r\ndown to us through the Dinosaurs, and the close affinity of the latter\r\nwith recent struthious birds (ostrich, etc.), will hardly be\r\nquestioned. The case amounts almost to a demonstration, if we compare\r\nwith Dinosaurs their contemporaries, the Mesozoic birds. The classes\r\nof birds and reptiles, as now living, are separated by a gulf so\r\nprofound that a few years since it was cited by the opponents of\r\nEvolution as the most important break in the animal series, and one\r\nwhich that doctrine could not bridge over. Since then, as Professor\r\nHuxley has clearly shown, this gap has been virtually filled by the\r\ndiscovery of bird-like reptiles and reptilian birds. Compsognathus and\r\nArchæopteryx of the Old World, and Ichthyornis and Hesperornis of the\r\nNew, are the stepping-stones by which the Evolutionist of to-day\r\nleads the doubting brother across the shallow remnant of the gulf,\r\nonce thought impassable.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[22] _The Introduction and Succession of Vertebrate Life in America._\r\nAn address delivered before the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, at Nashville, Tenn., August, 1877. See\r\n_Nature_, vol. xvi.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to describe two of the strangest and most wonderful of\r\nall the Dinosaurs, recently discovered in the far West. The first of\r\nthese is the Stegosaurus,[23] or plated lizard, not wholly unknown\r\nbefore, because part of its skeleton was found some years ago in a\r\nbrickfield in the Kimmeridge Clay at Swindon. It has been proved that\r\nsome of the bones to which the name Omosaurus[24] has been applied\r\nreally belonged to the former genus.\r\n\r\n[23] Greek--_stegos_, roof or covering; _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\n[24] Greek--_omos_, humerus, and _sauros_, lizard.\r\n\r\nWith such complete specimens now known by Professor Marsh's\r\ndescriptions, it will not be necessary to mention the meagre remains\r\ndiscovered in this country, or the conclusions arrived at by Owen and\r\nSeeley, interesting as they are.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1877 Professor Marsh described, in the _American Journal\r\nof Science_, a considerable portion of a skeleton of a Stegosaur,\r\nremarking that this genus proved to be one of the most remarkable\r\nanimals yet discovered. It was found on the eastern flank of the Rocky\r\nMountains, in strata of Jurassic age; they indicated an animal about\r\ntwenty-five feet long, and for this discovery Science is indebted to\r\nProfessor A. Lakes and Engineer H. C. Beckwith of the United States\r\nNavy, who found the remains in Colorado, near the locality of the\r\ngigantic Atlantosaurus. The solid limb-bones seem to point to an\r\naquatic life, but there can be little doubt that the monster did not\r\npass all its time in the water. (Fig. 25 shows the skeleton.)[25]\r\n\r\n[25] The writer is informed that this skeleton is not yet mounted in\r\nthe Yale College Museum, but that it will be before long. Our artist\r\nhas drawn it as if set up, with a man standing by for comparison.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Professor Marsh announced the discovery of additional remains\r\nfrom several localities. The most striking feature--from which the\r\nStegosaur takes its name--was the presence of huge bony plates\r\nbelonging to its skin, as well as large and small spines. Some of the\r\nplates were from two to three feet in diameter, and they were of\r\nvarious shapes. Of the spines, some were of great size and power, one\r\npair being each over two feet long! The skull was remarkably small,\r\nand more like that of a lizard than we find in most Dinosaurs; the\r\njaws were short and massive. Little was known at first of the brain,\r\nbut fortunately a later discovery showed the brain-case well\r\npreserved. Later still, more than twenty other specimens of this\r\nDinosaur were obtained, so that nearly every portion of the skeleton\r\nis now known. The skulls indicate that the creature possessed large\r\neyes and a considerable power of smell. The jaws contain but a single\r\nrow of teeth in actual use; but as these wore out, they were replaced\r\nby others lodged in a cavity below. Teeth, however, were not its\r\nstrong point; they indicate a diet of soft succulent vegetation. The\r\nvertebræ have the faces of their centra more or less bi-concave. Many\r\ncurious features in the skeleton can only be explained with reference\r\nto the heavy armour of plates and spines with which the Stegosaur was\r\nprovided. Thus the vertebræ have their \"neural spines\" expanded at the\r\nsummit to aid in supporting part of the armour. (See Fig. 26.) The\r\nfore limbs were short and massive, but provided with five fingers; the\r\nhind limbs were very much larger and more powerful. These and the\r\npowerful tail show that the monster could support itself on them as on\r\na tripod, in an upright position, and this position must have been\r\neasily assumed in consequence of the massive hind quarters. As in\r\nIguanodon, there were three toes to the hind feet, and these were\r\nprobably covered by strong hoofs. The fore limbs could move freely in\r\nvarious directions like a human arm, and were probably used in\r\nself-defence. (See Fig. 27.) But for this purpose the tail with its\r\nfour pairs of huge spines would be very effective, and one could\r\neasily imagine that a single deadly blow from such a tail would be\r\nsufficient to drive away, if not to kill, one of the carnivorous\r\nenemies of the species. All the plates and spines were, during life,\r\nprotected by a thick horny covering, which must have increased their\r\nsize and weight. Such a covering seems to be clearly indicated by\r\ncertain grooves and impressions that mark their surfaces. (See Fig.\r\n28.) The largest plates are unsymmetrical, and were probably arranged\r\nalong the back, as in our restoration, Plate IX. It will be noticed,\r\nby those who are familiar with our first edition that Plate X. gives a\r\nsomewhat different representation of the Stegosaur, in which the\r\nlength of the hind limbs is more apparent, and also they are more free\r\nfrom the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25--Skeleton of _Stegosaurus ungulatus_; length\r\nabout 25 feet. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate X.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC ARMOURED DINOSAUR, STEGOSAURUS UNGULATUS.\r\n\r\nLength about 30 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Tail vertebræ of _Stegosaurus_. (After\r\nMarsh.)\r\n\r\n1. Side view. 2. Front view.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Stegosaur displays a rather remarkable feature; for a\r\nvery large chamber was found in the sacrum[26] formed by an enlargement\r\nof the spinal cord. The chamber strongly resembled the brain-case in\r\nthe skull, but was about ten times as large! So this anomalous\r\nmonster had two sets of brains, one in its skull, and the other in the\r\nregion of its haunches! and the latter, in directing the movements of\r\nthe huge hind limbs and tail, did a large share of the work. The\r\nsubject is a highly suggestive one, but at present requires further\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n[26] The sacrum may be thus defined: the Vertebræ (usually fused\r\ntogether) which unite with the haunch-bones (_ilia_) to form the\r\npelvis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Limb-bones of _Stegosaurus_. (After Marsh.)\r\n\r\n1. Fore leg. 2. Hind leg.]\r\n\r\nOn the walls of the fossil reptile gallery at South Kensington the\r\nreader will find a large framed drawing of the skeleton of\r\nStegosaurus, kindly sent by Professor Marsh, whose forthcoming\r\nmonograph will be welcomed by all palæontologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--1, 2. Plates of Stegosaurus. The middle\r\nfigures show their thickness. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.-Head of _Triceratops_, seen from above. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe last, and in some ways the strangest of the Dinosaurs, was the\r\nTriceratops[27] that flourished in America at the end of the long\r\nMesozoic era, during the Cretaceous period. The name refers to the\r\nthree horn-cores found on the skull, which probably supported true\r\nhorns like those of oxen. Whereas the Stegosaur was provided with\r\nquite a small skull, this monster had one of huge dimensions and\r\nremarkable shape (see Figs. 29 and 30).[28] In the younger ones it was\r\nabout six feet long, but in an old individual must have reached a\r\nlength of seven or eight feet. Such a skull is only surpassed by some\r\nwhales of the present day. Twenty different skulls of this kind have\r\nbeen found, and Professor Marsh places the horned Dinosaurs in a\r\nseparate family, to which he has given the name Ceratopsidæ, or\r\nhorn-faced. Their remains come from the Laramie beds, believed to be\r\nof Cretaceous age, but representing a remarkably mixed fauna and\r\nflora, so that some have considered them to be Tertiary. The strata\r\ncontaining these fossils are very rich in organic remains, and have\r\nyielded not only other Dinosaurs, but Plesiosaurs, crocodiles,\r\nturtles, many small reptiles, a few birds, fishes, and small mammals.\r\nThe Ceratops beds are of fresh-water or brackish origin, and can now\r\nbe traced for nearly eight hundred miles along the east flank of the\r\nRocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[27] Greek--_treis_, three; _ceras_, horn; _ops_, face.\r\n\r\n[28] This skeleton has not yet been set up in the Yale College Museum,\r\nbut will be before long. Our artist has drawn it as if set up, with a\r\nman standing by for comparison. In an article in _The Californian\r\nIllustrated Magazine_ for April, 1892 (quoted in the _Review of\r\nReviews_ for May), an American writer incorrectly describes this\r\nmonster as \"higher than Jumbo, and longer than two Jumbos placed in a\r\nrow.\" But the article is altogether untrustworthy, and the two\r\n\"restorations\" are absurd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Skeleton of _Triceratops prorsus_; length\r\nabout 25 feet. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nIn this Dinosaur we find the fore feet larger than usual in proportion\r\nto the hind limbs, and there can be no doubt that it walked on all\r\nfours. Its length was about twenty-five feet. All the vertebræ and\r\nlimb-bones are solid. The brain was smaller in proportion to the skull\r\nthan in any known vertebrate.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are remarkable in having two distinct roots. The wedge-like\r\nform of the skull is also very peculiar. The two large horns come\r\nimmediately over the eyes, and the small one above the nose; this\r\nDinosaur was, therefore, well provided with weapons of offence, such\r\nas would be highly useful in driving away or wounding carnivorous\r\nenemies. The back part of the skull rises up into a kind of huge\r\ncrest, and this during life was protected by a special fringe of bony\r\nplates. Such an arrangement doubtless formed an effective shield to\r\nward off blows when one Triceratops was fighting another, as bulls or\r\nbuffaloes of the present day fight with their horns. The mouths of\r\nthese Dinosaurs formed a kind of beak, sheathed in horn.\r\n\r\nThe body as well as the skull was protected, but the nature and\r\nposition of the defensive parts in different forms cannot yet be\r\ndetermined with certainty. Various spines, bones, and plates have been\r\nfound that evidently were meant for the protection of the creature's\r\nbody, and belonged to the skin. Probably some of these were placed on\r\nthe back, behind the crest of the skull; some may have defended the\r\nthroat, as in Stegosaurus. Altogether, Triceratops is very different\r\nto any other Dinosaur. One cannot help picturing it rather as a fierce\r\nrhinoceros-like animal. In the restoration (Plate XI., Frontispiece)\r\nour artist has given it a thick skin, rather like that of the\r\nrhinoceros, only indicating small bony plates, etc., here and there.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh thinks that as the head increased in size to bear its\r\narmour of bony plates, the neck first, then the fore feet, and then\r\nthe whole skeleton was specially modified to support it; and he\r\nconcludes that as these changes took place in the course of the\r\nevolution of this wonderful Dinosaur, the head at last became so large\r\nand heavy that it must have been too much for the body to bear, and so\r\nhave led to its destruction! This conclusion, if sound, is a warning\r\nagainst carrying \"specialisation\" too far. If we wished to write an\r\nepitaph on the tomb of the monster, it ought (according to Professor\r\nMarsh) to be, \"I and my race died of over-specialisation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Bony spines belonging to the skin of\r\n_Triceratops_. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nAfter all these various efforts to improve themselves and to perfect\r\ntheir organisation so as to bring it into harmony with their\r\nsurroundings, or \"environment,\" as the biologists say, it seems rather\r\nhard that the Dinosaurs should have been extinguished, and their place\r\nin Nature taken by a higher type; but all things have their day, even\r\nDinosaurs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the difficulties, hardships, and dangers attending the\r\ndiscovery and transport of the remains, Professor Marsh's concluding\r\nremarks may be quoted here, since they give us a glimpse into the\r\nnature of his explorations in the far West that have now become so\r\nfamous. He says, \"In conclusion, let me say a word as to how the\r\ndiscoveries here recorded have been accomplished. The main credit for\r\nthe work justly belongs to my able assistant, Mr. J. B. Hatcher, who\r\nhas done so much to bring to light the ancient life of the Rocky\r\nMountain regions. I can only claim to have shared a few of the dangers\r\nand hardships with him, but without his skill little would have been\r\naccomplished. If you will bear in mind that two of the skulls weighed\r\nnearly two tons each, when partially freed from their matrix and ready\r\nfor shipment, in a deep desert cañon, fifty miles from a railway, you\r\nwill appreciate one of the mechanical difficulties overcome. When I\r\nadd that some of the most interesting discoveries were made in the\r\nhunting-grounds of the hostile Sioux Indians, who regard such\r\nexplorations with superstitious dread, you will understand another\r\nphase of the problem. I might speak of even greater difficulties and\r\ndangers, but the results attained repay all past efforts, and I hope\r\nat no distant day to have something more of interest to lay before\r\nyou.\"[29]\r\n\r\n[29] _American Journal of Science_, vol. xli. p. 176.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFLYING DRAGONS.\r\n\r\n\"Geology does better in reclothing dry bones and revealing lost\r\ncreations than in tracing veins of lead or beds of iron.\"--Ruskin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Ocean of Air was not uninhabited during the long ages of the\r\nMesozoic era, when fishes swarmed in the seas, and reptiles, such as\r\nwe have attempted to describe in the last five chapters, trod the\r\nearth, or swam across lakes and rivers. With such an exuberance of\r\nlife in various forms, it would indeed have been strange if the\r\natmosphere had only been tenanted by humble little insects like\r\ndragon-flies, locusts, or butterflies and moths, all of which we know\r\nwere living then.\r\n\r\nNow, the record of the rocks tells us that one great order of reptiles\r\nsomehow acquired the power of flying, and flitted about as bats or\r\nflying-foxes do now. Since they were undoubtedly reptiles--in spite of\r\ncertain resemblances to birds--we have ventured to call them \"flying\r\ndragons,\" as others have done. The notion of a flying reptile may\r\nperhaps seem strange, or even impossible to some persons; but no one\r\nhas a right to say such and such a thing \"cannot be,\" or is \"contrary\r\nto Nature,\" for the world is full of wonderful things such as we\r\nshould have considered impossible had we not seen them with our eyes.\r\nCharles Kingsley, in his delightful fairy tale, _The Water-Babies_,\r\nmakes some humorous remarks on that matter, which we may quote here.\r\nHe says, \"Did not learned men too hold, till within the last\r\ntwenty-five years, that a flying dragon was an impossible monster?\r\nAnd do we not now know that there are hundreds of them found fossil up\r\nand down the world? People call them Pterodactyls; but that is only\r\nbecause they are ashamed to call them flying dragons, after denying so\r\nlong that flying dragons could exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Cuvier observes that it was not merely in magnitude\r\nthat reptiles stood pre-eminent in ancient days, but they were\r\ndistinguished by forms more varied and extraordinary than any that are\r\nnow known to exist on the face of the earth. Among these extinct\r\nbeings of ages incalculably remote, are the Pterodactyls,[30] or\r\n\"wing-fingered\" creatures, which had the power of flight, not by a\r\nmembrane stretched over elongated fingers as in bats, nor by a wing\r\nwithout distinct or complete fingers, as in birds, but by a membrane\r\nsupported chiefly by a greatly extended little finger, the other\r\nfingers being short and armed with claws.\r\n\r\n[30] From the Greek--_pteron_, wing, and _dactylos_, finger.\r\n\r\nThe only reptile now existing which has any power of sustaining itself\r\nin the air is the little _Draco Volans_, or \"flying lizard,\" so\r\ncalled; but this can scarcely be regarded as a flying animal. Its\r\nhinder pair of ribs, however, are prolonged to such an extent that\r\nthey support a broad expansion of the skin, so spread out from side to\r\nside as to perform the office of a parachute, thus enabling the\r\ncreature to spring from tree to tree by means of extended leaps; and\r\nthis it does with wonderful activity.\r\n\r\nMany forms of Pterodactyl are known. Some were not larger than a\r\nsparrow; others about the size of a woodcock; yet others much larger,\r\nthe largest of all having a spread of wing (or rather of the flying\r\nmembranes) of twenty-five feet! It has been concluded that they could\r\nperch on trees, hang against perpendicular surfaces, such as the edge\r\nof a cliff, stand firmly on the ground, and probably crawl on all\r\nfours with wings folded. It may be well at once to point out that the\r\nPterodactyl had no _true_ wings like those of a bird, but a thin\r\nmembrane similar to that of a bat, only differently supported; so it\r\nmust be understood that, when we use the word \"wing,\" it is not in\r\nthe scientific sense that we are using it, but in the popular sense,\r\njust as we might speak of the wing of a bat, although the bat has no\r\ntrue wing. Figs. 32, 33, 34, and 35 will give the reader some idea of\r\nthe various forms presented by the skeletons of Pterodactyls, or, as\r\nsome authorities call them, Pterosaurians (winged lizards). Great\r\ndifferences of opinion have existed among palæontologists as to\r\nwhether they are more reptilian than bird-like, or even mammalian.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years ago, in 1784, Collini, who was Director of\r\nthe Elector-Palatine Museum at Mannheim, described a skeleton which he\r\nregarded as that of an unknown marine animal. It was a long-billed\r\nPterodactyl from the famous lithographic stone of Solenhofen in\r\nBavaria. The specimen was figured in the _Memoirs of the Palatine\r\nAcademy_. Collini was able from this specimen to make out the head,\r\nneck, small tail, left leg, and two arms; but beyond that, he was at a\r\nloss. His conclusion was that the skeleton belonged neither to a bat\r\nnor to a bird, and he inquired whether it might not be an amphibian.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 this specimen came into Cuvier's hands, who at once perceived\r\nthat it belonged to a reptile that could fly, and it was he who\r\nproposed the name Pterodactyl. Until the oracle at Paris was\r\nconsulted, the greatest uncertainty prevailed, one naturalist\r\nregarding it as a bird, another as a bat. Cuvier, with his penetrating\r\neye and patient investigation, combated these theories, supported\r\nthough they were by weighty authorities. The principal key by means of\r\nwhich he solved the problem, and detected the saurian relationship of\r\nthe Pterodactyl, seems to have been a certain bone belonging to the\r\nskull, known as the quadrate bone. In his great work, _Ossemens\r\nFossiles_, he says, \"Behold an animal which, in its osteology, from\r\nits teeth to the end of its claws, offers all the characters of the\r\nsaurians.... But it was, at the same time, an animal provided with the\r\nmeans of flight--which, when stationary, could not have made much use\r\nof its anterior extremities, even if it did not keep them always\r\nfolded as birds keep their wings, which nevertheless might use its\r\nsmall anterior fingers to suspend itself from the branches of trees,\r\nbut when at rest must have been ordinarily on its hind feet, like the\r\nbirds again; and also, like them, must have carried its neck sub-erect\r\nand curved backwards, so that its enormous head should not interrupt\r\nits equilibrium.\"\r\n\r\nPterodactylus macronyx, or, as it is now called, Dimorphodon macronyx\r\n(Fig. 32), was about the size of a raven. It was discovered in 1828 by\r\nthe late Miss Mary Anning, the well-known collector of fossils from\r\nthe Liassic rocks that form the cliffs alone: the coast of\r\nDorsetshire, near Lyme-Regis. This important specimen was figured and\r\ndescribed by Dr. Buckland, in the _Transactions of the Geological\r\nSociety_. He suggested the specific name macronyx on account of the\r\ngreat length of the claws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32--Skeleton of _Dimorphodon macronyx_. (After\r\nOwen.)]\r\n\r\nThis authority pointed out an unusual provision for giving support and\r\npower of movement to the large head at the extremity of a rather long\r\nneck, namely, the occurrence of fine long tendons running parallel to\r\nthe neck-vertebræ. This does not occur in any modern lizards, whose\r\nnecks are short, and require no such aid to support the head. They are\r\na compensation for weakness that would otherwise arise from the\r\nelongation of the neck, supporting, as it did, such a large head. The\r\nneck-vertebræ in this species are large and strong, and capable of\r\ngreat flexibility forwards and backwards, so that the creature, by\r\nbending its neck during flight into the shape of an S, could throw its\r\nhead back towards the centre of gravity. The restoration of the\r\nskeleton seen in the figure is by Professor Owen. It is probable that\r\nthis Pterodactyl could walk on the ground with its wings folded, and\r\nperhaps it was also capable of perching on trees, by clinging on to\r\ntheir branches with its feet and toes. When the flying membrane was\r\nstretched out it must, on account of the long tail to which it was\r\nalso attached, have presented a triangular shape, somewhat like a\r\nboy's kite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Skeleton of _Scaphognathus crassirostris_.\r\n1/3 natural size.]\r\n\r\nAnother genus, also from the lithographic slate of Bavaria, namely,\r\nScaphognathus crassirostris (so called on account of its large beak\r\nand jaws), had a very short tail, and its skeleton looks somewhat\r\nclumsy for a creature adapted to fly through the air (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\nPterodactylus spectabilis, from the same strata, also possessed a very\r\nshort tail, but has a more elegant and bird-like skull. This pretty\r\nlittle flying dragon was only about as large as a sparrow (see Fig.\r\n34). Its neck is comparatively short, with but few joints. The long\r\nslender beak was probably sheathed in horn, and the skull in several\r\nways approaches that of a bird. Since there are no teeth in the jaws,\r\nwe may suppose that it devoured dragon-flies or other insects, such as\r\nwe know were in existence during the period when the lithographic\r\nstone of Bavaria was being deposited. Those forms that were provided\r\nwith teeth probably devoured such fishes as they could catch by\r\nswooping down upon the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Skeleton of _Pterodactylus spectabilis_.]\r\n\r\nCuvier thought, from the magnitude of their eyes, that Pterodactyls\r\nwere of nocturnal habits. \"With flocks of such creatures flying in the\r\nair, and shoals of no less monstrous Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri\r\nswarming in the ocean, and gigantic crocodiles and tortoises crawling\r\non the shores of the primæval lakes and rivers--air, sea, and land\r\nmust have been strangely tenanted in these early periods of our infant\r\nworld.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[31] Buckland, _Bridgewater Treatise_.\r\n\r\nIt was thought at one time that Birds differed from Pterodactyls in\r\nthe absence of teeth; but this only holds good for modern birds. If we\r\ngo back to the Mesozoic age, we find that birds at that time did\r\npossess teeth. The oldest known bird, the Archæopteryx, had teeth in\r\nits jaws, and presents some very striking points of resemblance to\r\nreptiles. But if we compare the skeleton of a Pterodactyl (such as the\r\nP. spectabilis, now under consideration) with that of a bird, we shall\r\nsee in its fore limbs certain very obvious differences. A bird never\r\nhas more than three fingers in its hand or wing (viz. the thumb and\r\nnext two digits), and the bones that support these fingers,\r\ncorresponding to the bones in the palm of a human hand, are joined\r\ntogether. Neither of the bones corresponding to our fingers are much\r\nelongated, and of these the longest is that which corresponds to the\r\nthumb. But, on referring to the skeleton of our Pterodactyl, we find\r\nthat it has four fingers, three of which are fairly developed and\r\nfurnished with claws, while the outermost one is enormously elongated.\r\nThis is believed to correspond to the little finger of the human hand,\r\nwhile the thumb seems to be represented by a small bone seen at the\r\nwrist. It was this long outside finger that chiefly served to support\r\nthe flying membrane of the Pterodactyl. For this and other reasons, we\r\nare forbidden to look upon these creatures as relatives of birds.\r\nAgain, all birds that can fly possess a \"merrythought,\" or furculum;\r\nand such is not found in the Pterodactyl.\r\n\r\nAs we have already remarked, some authorities, when these creatures\r\nwere first brought to light, considered them to be mammals, as bats\r\nare. But equally conclusive arguments may be brought forward against\r\nthat view. All mammals have the skull jointed to the backbone by two\r\narticulations, known as \"condyles,\" whereas Pterodactyls have only\r\none--in that respect resembling reptiles and birds.\r\n\r\nAlso there are important differences in the structure of their jaws,\r\nshowing that they are constructed on the reptilian plan, and not on\r\nthat of the mammal.\r\n\r\nIn order to give rapid movement to their wings during flight, they had\r\npowerful muscles in the region of the chest. These were attached to a\r\nshield-like breast-bone provided with a keel--as in birds. But this\r\nbird-like feature is only a necessary provision to enable them to fly,\r\nand does not point to any relationship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Skeleton of _Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus_, with\r\ndelicate impressions of the flying membranes. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1873 was discovered, in the lithographic stone of Bavaria,\r\nat Eichstädt, a very beautiful new form of Pterodactyl. This was the\r\nRhamphorhynchus phyllurus. The specimen is in a remarkable state of\r\npreservation; for the bones of the skeleton are nearly all in\r\nposition, while those of both wings show very perfect impressions of\r\nthe membranes attached to them. Its long tail supported another small\r\nleaf-like membrane, which was evidently used as a rudder in flight\r\n(see Fig. 35). The discovery of this valuable specimen attracted much\r\nattention at the time. It was bought, by telegram, for Professor\r\nMarsh, and so secured for the Yale College Museum; but a cast may be\r\nseen at South Kensington (Wall-case, No. 1, Gallery IV. on plan).\r\n\r\nAny one who looks carefully at the beautiful impressions of the wings\r\nof this specimen can see that they must have been produced by a thin\r\nsmooth membrane, very similar to that of bats. When this elegant\r\nlittle creature was covered up by the fine soft mud that now forms the\r\nlithographic stone, its wings were partly folded, so that the\r\nmembranes were more or less contracted into folds, like an umbrella\r\nonly partly open. These appear to have been attached all along the arm\r\nand to the end of the long finger. They then made a graceful curve\r\nbackward to the hind foot, and probably were continued beyond the\r\nlatter so as to join the tail. With its graceful pointed wings and\r\nlong tail, this little flying saurian must have been a beautiful\r\nobject, as it slowly mounted upwards from some cliff overlooking the\r\nJurassic seas. (See Plate XII.)\r\n\r\nLike those already described, it was provided with four short-clawed\r\nfingers, as well as the one which mainly supported its wing. Some of\r\nthe Continental museums contain good collections of fossil\r\nPterodactyls; but the largest collection in the world is that of Yale\r\nCollege, where Professor Marsh declares there are the remains of six\r\nhundred individuals from the American Cretaceous rocks alone!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Skull of _Pteranodon_. 1. Side view. 2. Top\r\nview. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the fragmentary remains from our Cambridge Greensand formation\r\nindicate Pterodactyls of enormous size. Thus the neck-vertebræ of one\r\nspecies measure two inches in length, while portions of arm-bones are\r\nthree inches broad. It is probable that the creatures to which these\r\nbones once belonged measured eighteen or twenty feet from tip to tip\r\nof the wings. Other also fragmentary remains from the chalk of Kent\r\ntestify to the existence of Pterodactyls during that period fully\r\nequal in size.\r\n\r\nBut the largest Pterodactyls hail, like so many other big things, from\r\nAmerica. Professor Marsh tells us of monsters in his famous collection\r\nwith a spread of wings of twenty to twenty-five feet! These large\r\nforms had no teeth in their jaws, and their skulls are of a peculiar\r\nform. The long-pointed jaws were probably sheathed in horn during\r\nlife, as in birds (see Fig. 36). According to Marsh, these toothless\r\nforms (which he calls Pteranodonts) were mostly of gigantic size. With\r\nregard to their food it is almost vain to speculate; but if they _did_\r\nprey upon fishes, they must have had a capacious mouth and gullet, and\r\nmust have swallowed their prey whole, after the fashion of pelicans.\r\nBut we doubt if they had the peculiar pouch possessed by those birds.\r\nIn the absence of more complete accounts of the large forms the artist\r\nhas only attempted to restore the small ones. (See Plate XII., showing\r\nfour different kinds.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XII.\r\n\r\nGROUP OF SMALL FLYING DRAGONS, OR PTERODACTYLS.\r\n\r\n             _Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus._\r\n\r\n_Pterodactylus crassirostris. Dimorphodon macronyx._\r\n\r\n             _Pterodactylus spectabilis._]\r\n\r\nWhether Pterodactyls were cold-blooded or warm-blooded is a question\r\non which the authorities are not agreed. Professor Owen argued from\r\nthe absence of feathers that they could not have been warm-blooded.\r\nBut, in spite of this great authority, who has defended his opinion\r\nsomewhat strongly, there are others who argue that the amount of work\r\ninvolved in sustaining a Pterodactyl in the air make it highly\r\nprobable that it was warm-blooded. The absence of feathers to retain\r\nthe heat of the body need not be regarded as conclusive, for bats are\r\nwarm-blooded animals, and in their case the heat of the body is\r\nretained by a slight downy covering to the skin. Such a covering may\r\nhave protected the bodies of Pterodactyls, and we could not expect to\r\nsee any trace of it in the Bavarian specimen of Rhamphorhynchus\r\nreferred to above. An important fact bearing on this question is the\r\ndiscovery of perforations in the bones of these animals very similar\r\nto those seen in birds. Now, birds have a wonderful system of\r\nrespiration, or breathing. The air they breathe passes, not into their\r\nlungs only, but penetrates to the remotest parts of their system,\r\nfilling their very bones with life, and endowing them with activity\r\nand animation adapted to their active aërial existence. It may,\r\ntherefore, be argued that Pterodactyls breathed much in the same way;\r\nthat their bones, too, were supplied with air by an elaborate system\r\nof air-sacs, and that they had lungs like those of birds. We cannot,\r\nhowever, stop there, but are led on by physiological reasoning to\r\nconclude that the circulation of the blood must have been rapid, and\r\nthat the heart was like that of birds and mammals, four-celled. It\r\nwould therefore follow--since birds and mammals are warm-blooded--that\r\nPterodactyls were also. Such, at least, is the view of Professor H. G.\r\nSeeley, who says of the Cambridge specimens, \"That they lived\r\nexclusively upon land and in air is improbable, considering the\r\ncircumstances under which their remains are found. It is likely that\r\nthey haunted the sea-shores, and, while sometimes rowing themselves\r\nover the water with their powerful wings, used the wing-membranes, as\r\nthe bat does, to enclose their prey, and bring it to the mouth.\r\n\r\n\"The large Cambridge Pterodactyls probably pursued a more substantial\r\nprey than dragon-flies. Their teeth are well suited for fish, but\r\nprobably fowl and small mammals, and even fruits, made a variety in\r\ntheir food. As lord of the cliff, it may be presumed to have taken\r\ntoll of all animals that could be conquered with tooth and nail. From\r\nits brain it might be regarded as an intelligent animal. The jaws\r\npresent indications of having been sheathed with a horny covering.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the large Pterodactyls of the Cretaceous period, soaring like\r\nalbatrosses and giant petrels over the surface of the ocean,\r\nco-operated with the marine reptiles, such as Ichthyosaurs,\r\nPlesiosaurs, crocodiles, and others, as those sea-birds now do with\r\nthe whales, porpoises, and dolphins, in reducing the excessive numbers\r\nof the teeming tribes of fishes, and in maintaining the balance of\r\noceanic life.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the place of Pterodactyls in the animal kingdom,\r\nProfessor Seeley places them as a distinct sub-class, side by side\r\nwith birds, and between mammals and reptiles, thus--\r\n\r\n  Mammalia.\r\n             O\r\n             r\r\n             n\r\n             i\r\n             t A\r\n             h v\r\n             o e\r\n             s s\r\n             a\r\n             u\r\n             r\r\n             i\r\n             a\r\n  Reptilia.\r\n\r\nThe name Ornithosauria (bird-lizards) is frequently used instead of\r\nthe other name, because it expresses the idea of their being partly\r\nsaurian, and partly bird-like.\r\n\r\nThey flourished from the period of the Lias to that of the Chalk; and\r\nthen, like so many other strange forms, seem to have suddenly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSEA-SERPENTS.\r\n\r\n    \"Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,\r\n    Where the winds are all asleep;\r\n    Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,\r\n    Where the salt weed sways in the stream;\r\n    Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,\r\n    Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;\r\n    Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,\r\n    Dry their mail, and bask in the brine.\"\r\n\r\n    _The Forsaken Merman._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that everything on earth has its double in the water.\r\nAre there not water-beetles, water-scorpions, water-rats,\r\nwater-snakes, sea-lions, sea-horses, and a host of other living\r\nthings, whether plants or animals, bearing some sort of resemblance to\r\nothers that live on land? Then why not sea-serpents? The great\r\ncontroversy of the sea-serpent, that has so often been discussed in\r\nthe newspapers, need not be considered here. We are dealing not with\r\nthe present, but with the past; and whether or no the wonderful\r\nsailors' yarns of sea-serpents can be regarded as authentic, even in a\r\nsingle case, we can offer our readers infallible proof that, during\r\nthe so-called \"Age of Reptiles,\" certain monstrous saurian animals\r\nflourished in considerable abundance, which, though not true serpents,\r\nnevertheless must have borne a striking resemblance to such, as they\r\ncleaved he waters of primæval seas.[32]\r\n\r\n[32] See an interesting little work, entitled, _Sea-Monsters\r\nUnmasked_, by H. Lee (Clowes and Sons). Appendix II. contains some\r\nextracts therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe modern evolutionist believes that snakes are descended from\r\nlizards, possessing, as usual, four legs; that some primitive form of\r\nlizard with very small legs appeared on the scene, and found that it\r\ncould better move along by wriggling its body and pushing with its\r\nribs than by walking. So, in course of time, a race of lizards without\r\nlegs arose; these, by Natural Selection, and perhaps other means,\r\nbecame more and more elongated, so that they could move faster than\r\ntheir ancestors, and glide out of harm's way more effectually. Thus\r\nwas the snake evolved from a lizard.\r\n\r\nNow, in the great geological museum of the stratified rocks, there\r\nhave been discovered skeletons of marine reptiles, which propelled\r\nthemselves chiefly by means of their tails and elongated bodies,\r\nrather than by their limbs. The limbs were not discarded entirely as\r\nin the case of the serpents, but were useful in their way as the fins\r\nof fishes are. Perhaps, therefore, we may be justified in calling\r\nthese ancient monsters sea-serpents, in consideration of their long\r\nthin bodies; for they certainly would be called by that name if now\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, they were not serpents, but more or less like some\r\nof the extinct saurians described in chap. iv. The name, however, has\r\nbeen adopted by geologists, and is useful in so far as it serves to\r\nremind us of their very peculiar shape and structure. Remains of these\r\nstrange creatures have been found both in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest discoveries of remains of a fossil sea-serpent was\r\nmade by M. Hoffman, a Dutch military surgeon, in the year 1770.\r\nMaestricht, a city in the interior of the Netherlands, situated in the\r\nvalley of the Meuse, stands on certain strata of limestone and\r\nsandstone, belonging to the Upper Chalk. Extensive quarries have, for\r\nmany centuries, been worked in the sandstone, especially in the\r\neminence called St. Peter's Mount, which is a cape or headland between\r\nthe Meuse and the Jaar. This elevated plateau extends for some\r\ndistance towards Liége, and presents an almost perpendicular cliff\r\ntowards the Meuse. From the extensive works that have so long been\r\ncarried on, immense quantities of stone have been removed, and the\r\ncentre of the mountain is traversed by galleries, and hollowed by vast\r\nexcavations. Innumerable fossils, such as marine shells, corals,\r\ncrustaceans, bones and teeth of fishes, have been obtained from this\r\nrock. But St. Peter's Mount is now chiefly celebrated for the\r\ndiscovery of the bones and teeth of a huge saurian, to which Mr.\r\nConybeare has given the name Mosasaurus, on account of its connection\r\nwith the river Meuse. M. Hoffman had long been an assiduous collector\r\nof fossils from this neighbourhood, and he had the good fortune to\r\nobtain the famous specimen on which this genus is founded.\r\n\r\nIt was at first considered, by M. Faujas St. Fond, to be a crocodile;\r\nbut Cuvier and Camper formed a different and better conclusion.\r\nPerhaps no fossil ever had such a remarkable history as this one, as\r\nthe following account, from M. Faujas St. Fond's work on the fossils\r\nof St. Peter's Mount,[33] will show.\r\n\r\n[33] _Histoire Naturelle de la Montagne de St. Pierre._ This account\r\nis given by Dr. Mantell, in his _Petrifactions and their Teaching_,\r\n1851.\r\n\r\n\"Some workmen, on blasting the rock in one of the caverns of the\r\ninterior of the mountain, perceived, to their astonishment, the jaws\r\nof a large animal attached to the roof of the chasm. The discovery was\r\nimmediately made known to M. Hoffman, who repaired to the spot, and\r\nfor weeks presided over the arduous task of separating the mass of\r\nstone containing these remains from the surrounding rock. His labours\r\nwere rewarded by the successful extrication of the specimen, which he\r\nconveyed in triumph to his house. This extraordinary discovery,\r\nhowever, soon became the subject of general conversation, and excited\r\nso much interest, that the canon of the cathedral which stands on the\r\nmountain resolved to claim the fossil, in right of being lord of the\r\nmanor; and succeeded, after a long and harassing lawsuit, in obtaining\r\nthis precious relic. It remained for years in his possession, and\r\nHoffman died without regaining his treasure, or receiving any\r\ncompensation. At length the French Revolution broke out, and the\r\narmies of the Republic advanced to the gates of Maestricht. The town\r\nwas bombarded; but, at the suggestion of the committee of savans who\r\naccompanied the French troops to select their share of the plunder,\r\nthe artillery was not suffered to play on that part of the city in\r\nwhich the celebrated fossil was known to be preserved. In the mean\r\ntime, the Canon of St. Peter's, shrewdly suspecting the reason why\r\nsuch peculiar favour was shown to his residence, removed the specimen,\r\nand concealed it in a vault; but when the city was taken, the French\r\nauthorities compelled him to give up his ill-gotten prize, which was\r\nimmediately transmitted to the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris, where it\r\nstill forms one of the most striking objects in that magnificent\r\ncollection.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mantell quotes the Frenchman's remark on this transaction: \"_La\r\nJustice, quoique tardive, arrive enfin avec le temps_:\" but adds, \"The\r\nreader will probably think that, although the reverend canon was\r\njustly despoiled of his ill-gotten treasure, the French commissioners\r\nwere but very equivocal representatives of _Justice_!\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful cast (Fig. 37) at South Kensington (Fossil Reptile\r\nGallery, Wall-case 8) was presented to Dr. Mantell by Baron Cuvier in\r\n1825. It consists of both jaws, with numerous teeth, and some other\r\nparts (see Fig. 38). The length is about four and a half feet. This\r\nnearly perfect head was for a time a stumbling-block to many\r\nnaturalists, some of whom were of opinion that it belonged to a whale.\r\nCuvier and others considered it to be a kind of link between the\r\nIguanas and the Monitors.[34]\r\n\r\n[34] The Monitors are a family of large lizards inhabiting the warmer\r\nparts of Africa and Asia. They live near the banks of rivers, and some\r\nare altogether aquatic. They often devour the eggs of crocodiles and\r\naquatic birds. The Nile Monitor, or Varanus, grows to a length of six\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Skull of _Mosasaurus Hoffmanni_. The original\r\nis 4-1/2 ft. by 2-1/2 ft.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Teeth of Mosasaurus (half natural size). 1^a,\r\n2^a, transverse sections of the teeth.]\r\n\r\nThe entire backbone of the Maestricht animal appears to have consisted\r\nof one hundred and thirty-one vertebræ, of which ninety-seven belonged\r\nto the tail. The total length of the skeleton is estimated at\r\ntwenty-four feet, and the head was about one-sixth of the total\r\nlength. The tail is only ten feet long, whereas in a crocodile the\r\ntail exceeds the length of the body. Although in his day the limbs of\r\nthe Mosasaurus were imperfectly known, Cuvier rightly considered them\r\nto be adapted for swimming, and, with his usual foresight, concluded\r\nthat this monster was a marine reptile of great strength and activity,\r\nhaving a large tail flattened vertically and capable of being moved\r\nfrom side to side with such force and rapidity as to be a powerful\r\norgan of propulsion, capable of stemming the most agitated waters. The\r\nlarge conical recurved teeth, the largest of which was nearly three\r\ninches long, are well seen in Figs. 37 and 38. Dr. Mantell was\r\nfortunate enough to find, in the year 1820, some vertebræ from the\r\nEnglish Chalk near Lewes, which were identified as belonging to a\r\nMosasaurus.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 a portion of a lower jaw with large conical teeth was\r\ndiscovered in the Chalk near Norwich. But these teeth were not quite\r\nsimilar to those of the Maestricht specimen, and Professor Owen\r\ntherefore founded upon them the new genus Leiodon.[35] But Leiodon must\r\nhave been very similar to Mosasaurus.\r\n\r\n[35] Greek--_leios_, smooth, and _odous_, tooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Lower tooth of _Leiodon_. 1. Side view. 2.\r\nProfile.]\r\n\r\nOf late years many fine specimens have been discovered in North\r\nAmerica, and the labours of Leidy, Marsh, and Cope have been of the\r\ngreatest service in completing our knowledge of this strange group of\r\nsaurians. In the American Cretaceous seas they ruled supreme, as their\r\nnumbers, size, and carnivorous habits enabled them easily to vanquish\r\nall rivals. Probably some of them were seventy-five feet in length,\r\nthe smallest being ten or twelve feet long. In the inland Cretaceous\r\nsea from which the Rocky Mountains were beginning to emerge, these\r\nancient sea-serpents abounded; and many were entombed in its muddy\r\ndeposits. On one occasion, as Professor Marsh rode through a valley\r\nwashed out of this old ocean bed, he observed no less than seven\r\ndifferent skeletons of these monsters in sight at once! The same\r\nauthority mentions that the Museum of Yale College contains remains of\r\nnot less than 1400 distinct individuals. In some of these the skeleton\r\nis nearly if not quite complete; so that every part of its structure\r\ncan be determined with almost absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Cope of Pennsylvania University, who has made a\r\nspecial study of this group of extinct saurians, fifty-one species\r\nhave been discovered in North America, in the States of New Jersey,\r\nAlabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Nebraska. The same\r\nauthority has shown that they were characterised by a wonderful\r\nelongation of form, especially of the tail; that their heads were\r\nlarge, flat, and conical in shape, with eyes directed partly upward;\r\nthat they were furnished with two pairs of paddles like the flippers\r\nof a whale. With these flippers, and the eel-like strokes of their\r\nflattened tail, they swam with considerable speed. Like snakes, they\r\nwere furnished with four rows of formidable teeth on the roof of the\r\nmouth, which served admirably for seizing their prey.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable feature in these creatures was the arrangement\r\nfor permitting them to swallow their prey whole, in the manner of\r\nsnakes. Thus each half of the lower jaw was articulated at a point\r\nnearly midway between the ear and the chin, so as to greatly widen the\r\nspace between the jaws, and Professor Cope thinks that the throat\r\nmust consequently have been loose and baggy.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cope, however, in giving the name Pythonomorpha to this\r\nancient group, has pressed his views too far, and dwelt unduly on\r\ntheir supposed relationship with serpents. Other authorities regard\r\nthem as essentially swimming lizards, with four well-developed\r\npaddles; and this is probably the right view to take of them.\r\n\r\nThe following graphic account of the region where Professor Cope has\r\ndiscovered the skeletons of many sea-serpents, and of their habits and\r\naspect when alive, is taken from his well-known work on the Cretaceous\r\nVertebrata of the West.[36] After describing this region as a vast\r\nlevel tract between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, he says, \"If\r\nthe explorer searches the bottoms of the rain-washes and ravines, he\r\nwill doubtless come upon the fragment of a tooth or jaw, and will\r\ngenerally find a line of such pieces leading to an elevated position\r\non the bank or bluff, where lies the skeleton of some monster of the\r\nancient sea. He may find the vertebral column running far into the\r\nlimestone that locks him in his last prison; or a paddle extended on\r\nthe slope, as though entreating aid; or a pair of jaws lined with\r\nhorrid teeth, which grin despair on enemies they are helpless to\r\nresist; or he may find a conic mound, on whose apex glisten in the sun\r\nthe bleached bones of one whose last office has been to preserve from\r\ndestruction the friendly soil on which he reposed. Sometimes a pile of\r\nhuge remains will be discovered, which the dissolution of the rock has\r\ndeposited on the lower level; the force of rain and wash having been\r\ninsufficient to carry them away.\"\r\n\r\n[36] _Report of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey\r\nof the Territories_, vol. ii., 1875 (_Cretaceous Vertebrata_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIII.\r\n\r\nGROUP OF SEA-SERPENTS, ELASMOSAUR, AND FISHES.\r\n\r\n    Fishes, _Portheus_.      _Elasmosaurus._ Length 50 feet.\r\n    _Beryx._                 _Clidastes._ Length 40 feet.\r\n    _Osmeroides_, etc.       _Mosasaurus._ Length 75 feet.]\r\n\r\nBut the reader inquires, \"What is the nature of these creatures thus\r\nleft stranded a thousand miles from either ocean? How came they in the\r\nlimestone of Kansas, and were they denizens of land?\" These creatures\r\nlived in the Cretaceous period. The remains found in this region were\r\nmostly those of reptiles and fishes. Thirty-five species of reptiles\r\nare known from Kansas alone, representing six orders, and varying in\r\nlength from ten to eighty feet. One was terrestrial, four were fliers,\r\nthe rest inhabited the ocean. \"When they swam over what are now the\r\nplains, the coast-line extended from Arkansas to near Fort Riley, on\r\nthe Kansas River, and, passing a little eastward, traversed Minnesota\r\nto the British possessions, near the head of Lake Superior. The extent\r\nof sea to the westward was vast, and geology has not yet laid down its\r\nboundary; it was probably a shore now submerged beneath the waters of\r\nthe North Pacific.\"\r\n\r\nOther very elongated marine reptiles of this period, but with much\r\nthicker bodies, are called, by Professor Cope, Elasmosaurs. In this\r\ngroup, which is not yet fully worked out, occur such genera as\r\nCimoliosaurus, Polycotylus, Polyptychodon, and others. But it seems a\r\npity that they should be in any way separated from the Plesiosaurs,\r\nwhich they strongly resemble (see chap. iv., Plate III.). Though not\r\nsea-serpents, we have introduced them here because they flourished at\r\nthe same time, and lived in the same seas with the Mosasaurs and other\r\nforms of that group. The very large teeth, with strongly marked\r\nridges, of the Polyptychodon are abundant in the Cambridge Greensand\r\nthat underlies the chalk, and represent a very huge animal.\r\n\r\nIn our illustration, Plate XIII., the artist has represented the\r\nElasmosaurus[37] (of Cope) with its long thin neck stretched out in\r\nsearch of food on the bed of the sea. Professor Cope--thus describing\r\nthis monster, in language which seems somewhat fanciful--says, \"Far\r\nout on the expanse of this ancient sea might have been seen a huge\r\nsnake-like form, which rose above the surface, and stood erect, with\r\ntapering throat and arrow-shaped head, or swayed about, describing a\r\ncircle of twenty feet radius above the water. Then plunging into the\r\ndepths, naught would be visible but the foam caused by the\r\ndisappearing mass of life. Should several have appeared together, we\r\ncan easily imagine tall, flexible forms rising to the height of the\r\nmasts of a fishing-fleet, or like snakes twisting and knotting\r\nthemselves together. This extraordinary neck--for such it was--rose\r\nfrom a body of elephantine proportions. The limbs were probably two\r\npairs of paddles, like those of Plesiosaurus, from which this diver\r\nchiefly differed in the arrangement of the bones of the breast. In the\r\nbest-known species twenty-two feet represent the neck in a total\r\nlength of fifty feet. This is Elasmosaurus platyurus (Cope), a\r\ncarnivorous sea-reptile, no doubt adapted for deeper waters than many\r\nof the others. Like the snake-bird of Florida, it probably often swam\r\nmany feet below the surface, raising the head to the distant air for\r\nbreath, then withdrawing it, and exploring the depths forty feet\r\nbelow, without altering the position of its body. From the localities\r\nin which the bones have been found in Kansas, it must have wandered\r\nfar from land; and that many kinds of fishes formed its food is shown\r\nby the teeth and scales found in the position of its stomach.\"\r\n\r\n[37] Greek--_elasmos_, plate; _sauros_, lizard: probably on account of\r\nthe shape of the paddles.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the sea-serpents. Mosasaurus is now known to have\r\nbeen a long slender reptile, with a pair of powerful paddles in front,\r\na moderately long neck, and flat pointed head. The tail was very\r\nlong--flat and deep--like that of a great eel. Mosasaurus princeps is\r\ncomputed to have been seventy-five to eighty feet long. Clidastes was\r\nanother genus of long and slender shape, one species of which reached\r\na length of forty feet. Some forms of sea-serpent had sclerotic plates\r\nin the eye, such as we found in the fish-lizard, or Ichthyosaurus (p.\r\n46), but the announcement that their bodies were protected by bony\r\nplates has turned out to be a mistake, and the supposed plates really\r\nbelonged to the eye.\r\n\r\nLeiodon proriger (Cope) was abundant in the old North American\r\nCretaceous sea, and reached a length of seventy-five feet. It had a\r\nlong projecting muzzle, somewhat like the snout of a sturgeon.\r\nPlatecarpus and Tylosaurus had peculiarly sharp-pointed heads (see\r\nFig. 40).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Snout of Tylosaurus. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nA few words may be added here with regard to Professor Cope's\r\nimportant discovery of Leiodon--a genus already alluded to as having\r\nbeen founded by Sir Richard Owen. The type specimen of Leiodon\r\ndyseplor,[38] which first indicated the characters of this wonderful\r\nspecies, was obtained from the yellow beds of the Niobrara epoch of\r\nthe Jornada del Muerto, near Fort McRae, New Mexico. The greater part\r\nof the remains have been described by Professor Leidy. But a second\r\nspecimen, more complete in all respects, was discovered by Professor\r\nCope's exploring party during an expedition from Fort Wallace, Kansas,\r\nin 1871. This specimen he has fully described and figured in the\r\nreport already referred to (p. 140). It is a very instructive\r\nspecimen, including fifty of the vertebræ from all parts of the\r\nvertebral column, a large part of the cranium, with teeth, as well as\r\nimportant limb-bones. These precious relics were excavated from a\r\nchalk \"bluff,\" or high bank. Fragments of the jaws were seen lying on\r\nthe slope, and other portions entered the shale. On being followed, a\r\npart of the skull was taken from beneath the roots of a bush, and the\r\nvertebræ and limb-bones were found farther in. The series of vertebræ,\r\nafter extending some way along the face of the bluff, finally turned\r\ninto the hill, and were followed as far as time would permit, but\r\npart of the tail series had to be left. In size, the vertebræ of this\r\nenormous sea-serpent exceed those of Mosasaurus brumbyi. The latter\r\nhas hitherto been the largest known species of the order of\r\nPythonomorphs, exceeding twofold in its measurements the M. giganteus\r\nof Belgium. So the present reptile is much larger in its dimensions\r\nthan the New Jersey species called maximus by Professor Cope. \"If, as\r\nappears certain,\" says the professor, \"the Mosasauroid discovered by\r\nWebb measures seventy-five feet in length, and the M. maximus measured\r\neighty, the Leiodon dyspelor must have been the longest reptile known,\r\nand approaches very nearly the extreme of the mammalian growth seen in\r\nthe whales, though, of course, without their bulk. Such monsters may\r\nwell excite our surprise, as well as our curiosity, in the inquiry as\r\nto their source of food-supply, and what the character of those\r\ncontemporary animals preserved in the same geologic horizon.\"\r\n\r\n[38] We retain the old spelling with the _e_ as being nearer to the\r\nGreek, although Professor Cope writes it \"Liodon.\"\r\n\r\nIn our illustration, Plate XIII., the artist has endeavoured to\r\nrealise the outward aspect of the two genera of sea-serpents,\r\nMosasaurus and Clidastes. The fishes which they are pursuing are\r\nwell-known genera from the English Chalk, such as Beryx.\r\n\r\nTen species of Clidastes have been unearthed from the Kansas strata.\r\nThey did not reach such a size as the Leiodons, but were of elegant\r\nand flexible build, the largest species, C. cineriarum, reaching a\r\nlength of forty feet (see Fig. 41). A smaller species, of elegant\r\nproportions, has been called C. tortor (Cope). Its slenderness of body\r\nwas remarkable, and the large head was long and lance-shaped. Its\r\nlithe movements doubtless helped it to secure many fishes. It was\r\nfound coiled up beneath a ledge of rock, with its skull lying\r\nundisturbed in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe accounts given by Professor Cope of his explorations and the\r\ndifficulties encountered in procuring the valuable specimens on which\r\nhis conclusions are based, are most interesting, and such as every\r\nfossil-hunter will appreciate. We, in England, who visit clay pits,\r\nstone quarries, railway cuttings, etc., during a morning or an\r\nafternoon walk, and return home at our leisure with a few small\r\nspecimens in our pockets, or in a bag at our back, can hardly realise\r\nhow arduous must be the work of finding, digging out, and transporting\r\nfor such long distances the remains of the monsters of Kansas and\r\nother parts of North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Skeleton of _Clidastes cineriarum_; length 40\r\nfeet. (After Cope.)]\r\n\r\nThe following extracts have been selected from Professor Cope's\r\nreport, with a view to illustrating the nature of the explorations\r\nundertaken. \"The circumstances attending the discovery of one of these\r\nwill always be a pleasant recollection to the writer. A part of the\r\nface, with teeth, was observed projecting from the side of a bluff by\r\na companion in exploration, Lieutenant James H. Whitten, United States\r\nArmy, and we at once proceeded to follow up the indication with knives\r\nand picks. Soon the lower jaws were uncovered, with their glistening\r\nteeth, and then the vertebræ and ribs. Our delight was at its height\r\nwhen the bones of the pelvis and part of the hind limb were laid bare,\r\nfor they had never been seen before in the species, and scarcely in\r\nthe order. While lying on the bottom of the Cretaceous sea, the\r\ncarcase had been dragged hither and thither by the sharks and other\r\nrapacious animals, and the parts of the skeleton were displaced and\r\ngathered into a small area. The massive tail stretched away into the\r\nbluff, and, after much laborious excavation, we left a portion of it\r\nto more persevering explorers.\"\r\n\r\n\"The discovery of a related species, Platecarpus coryphæus (Cope), was\r\nmade by the writer under circumstances of difficulty peculiar to the\r\nplains. After examining the bluffs for half a day without result, a\r\nfew bone fragments were found in a wash above their base. Others led\r\nthe way to a ledge forty or fifty feet from both summit and foot,\r\nwhere, stretched along in the yellow chalk, lay the projecting\r\nportions of the whole monster. A considerable number of vertebræ were\r\nfound preserved by the protective embrace of the roots of a small\r\nbush, and, when they were secured, the pick and knife were brought\r\ninto requisition to remove the remainder. About this time, one of the\r\ngales, so common in that region, sprang up, and striking the bluff\r\nfairly, reflected itself upwards. So soon as the pick pulverised the\r\nrock, the limestone dust was carried into eyes, nose, and every\r\navailable opening in the clothing. I was speedily blinded, and my aid\r\ndisappeared in the cañon, and was seen no more while the work lasted.\r\nA handkerchief tied over the face, and pierced by minute holes\r\nopposite the eyes, kept me from total blindness, though dirt in\r\nabundance penetrated the mask. But a fine relic of Creative Genius was\r\nextracted from its ancient bed, and one that leads its genus in size,\r\nand explains its structure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41_a_.--Skull of _Platecarpus_. Upper Cretaceous.\r\nNorth America. (After Cope.)]\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion, riding along a spur of yellow chalk bluff, some\r\nvertebræ lying at its foot met my eye. An examination showed that the\r\nseries entered the rock, and, on passing round to the opposite side,\r\nthe jaws and muzzle were seen projecting from it, as though laid bare\r\nfor the convenience of the geologist. The spur was small and of soft\r\nmaterial, and we speedily removed it in blocks, to the level of the\r\nreptile, and took out the remains as they lay across the base from\r\nside to side.\"\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the \"Age of Reptiles,\" we cannot but marvel greatly\r\nat the diversity of forms assumed by the various orders of this class,\r\ntheir strange uncouth appearance, their assumption, in some cases, of\r\ncharacters only known at the present day among the mammals, their\r\ngreat abundance, and the perfect state in which their remains have\r\nbeen preserved in the stratified rocks of various parts of the world.\r\nAnd the reader may naturally ask, \"How is it that so many types have\r\ndisappeared altogether, leaving us out of a total of at least nine\r\norders, only four, viz. those represented by crocodiles, lizards,\r\nsnakes, and turtles?\" To such a question we can only answer that the\r\ncauses of the extinction of plants and animals in the past are not yet\r\nknown. Climate, geographical conditions, food-supply, competition,\r\nwith other causes, doubtless operated then as now; but if there is one\r\nclear lesson taught by the record of the rocks, it is this--that there\r\nhas been at work from the earliest periods a Law of Progress, so that\r\nhigher types, coming in at certain stages, have ousted the lower\r\ntypes, sometimes only partially, sometimes completely. But why the\r\nDinosaurs, for instance, perished entirely, while the crocodiles\r\nsurvived to the present day, no one can yet explain. We can see no\r\nreason, however, why such problems as these should not be solved in\r\nthe future by the co-operating labours of naturalists and geologists.\r\n\r\nIn the great onward and upward struggle for existence, higher types\r\nhave supplanted lower ones; and, in accordance with this biological\r\ntruth, we find that in the next era (known as the Tertiary or\r\nCainozoic) the mammal held the field while the reptile took a\r\nsubordinate place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSOME AMERICAN MONSTERS.\r\n\r\n     \"Geology, in the magnitude and sublimity of the objects of\r\n     which it treats, ranks next to Astronomy in the scale of the\r\n     Sciences.\"--Sir John F. W. Herschel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Cainozoic or Tertiary era, we enter upon the\r\n\"Age of Mammals,\" when great quadrupeds suddenly came upon the scene.\r\nThe place of the reptile was now taken by the mammal. In the long\r\nprevious era this higher type of life was not altogether wanting, but\r\nas far as the geological record is yet known, it appears only to have\r\nbeen represented by a few primitive little creatures, probably\r\nMarsupials, whose jaw-bones have been discovered in the New Red\r\nSandstone, and the Stonesfield Oolite.[39]\r\n\r\n[39] The English Cretaceous rocks, previously thought to be destitute\r\nof mammalian remains, have quite recently yielded teeth belonging to\r\nsome small mammal. These were found in Wealden strata.\r\n\r\nGeology tells of a great gap between the highest rocks of the\r\nCretaceous period and the lowest group of the succeeding Eocene period\r\n(see Table of Strata, Appendix I.). This gap, or break, testifies to a\r\nvery long interval of time during which important geographical and\r\nother changes took place; and consequently we find in Eocene rocks (at\r\nthe base of the Cainozoic series) a very different fauna and flora to\r\nthat which is preserved in the Chalk formation.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Cuvier among the fossils collected from Eocene rocks\r\nin the neighbourhood of Paris, especially the Gypseous series of\r\nMontmartre, revealed the existence of a very extensive fauna,\r\nespecially of new types of mammals; and his restoration of the\r\nPalæotherium, a tapir-like animal, and other forms, created a vast\r\namount of interest, and greatly stimulated the study of extinct\r\nanimals. As we have already remarked, the science of palæontology may\r\nbe said to have been founded by Cuvier (see Introduction, p. 5).\r\n\r\nBut now the scene shifts once more from Europe to the wilds of the Far\r\nWest. American geologists tell us that a long time ago (during the\r\nEocene period) there was a great tropical lake in the Wyoming\r\nterritory, on the borders of which roamed, amidst luxuriant\r\nvegetation, a large number of strange and primitive quadrupeds,\r\ntogether with many other forms of life. The most wonderful group of\r\nanimals that haunted the shores of this lake, or series of lakes, was\r\nthe Dinocerata so fully described by Professor Marsh, in his\r\nexhaustive monograph.[40] The name implies that they were terrible\r\nhorned monsters, but whether Nature provided them with true horns,\r\nlike those of horned cattle to-day, is at least open to doubt.\r\n\r\n[40] _The Dinocerata_, a monograph by O. C. Marsh, _United States\r\nGeological Survey_, vol. x.\r\n\r\nFig. 42 shows the skeleton of one of these, namely, Tinoceras ingens.\r\nIts length was about 12 feet without the tail. Its weight, when alive,\r\nis calculated to have been six thousand pounds, or about two tons and\r\nthree quarters.\r\n\r\nPlate XIV. is a restoration of the Tinoceras, made by our artist,\r\nafter much consideration and careful study of the valuable cast\r\nexhibited in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, which was\r\ngenerously presented by Professor Marsh (Gallery I. Case MM on plan).\r\nIn planning this and other restorations, both artist and author have\r\nreceived valuable assistance from Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., Keeper\r\nof the Geological Department of the Museum, who is ever ready to help\r\nwith his great knowledge those who come to consult him.\r\n\r\nThere may be differences of opinion among palæontologists as to the\r\nappearance presented by this formidable creature when alive, and no\r\ndoubt the nature of the skin must always be more or less a matter of\r\nconjecture in such cases, but we venture to hope that the restoration\r\nhere given, based as it is upon Mr. Smit's thorough acquaintance with\r\nliving animals and Professor Marsh's description, will meet with a\r\nfavourable verdict.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Skeleton of _Tinoceras ingens_. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nLooking at the skeleton, one is struck with a certain resemblance to\r\nthe rhinoceros on one hand, and to the elephant on the other. The legs\r\nare very elephantine, and the feet must have been covered with thick\r\npads, but the body reminds one more of the rhinoceros; and yet, again,\r\nthere is some suggestion of the hippopotamus. The eye was small and\r\ndeep set, as in the rhinoceros. In the upper jaw the two canine teeth\r\nare developed into dagger-shaped tusks, the use of which can only be\r\nconjectured. In the females these are but slightly developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIV.\r\n\r\nA LARGE EXTINCT MAMMAL, TINOCERAS INGENS.\r\n\r\nFrom North America. Length about 12 feet (without the tail).]\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear, then, that we cannot place the Dinoceras in any\r\norder of living mammals. It is what palæontologists call a\r\n\"generalised type;\" that is to say, it presents certain characters\r\nseen in several groups of living quadrupeds, and not any of those\r\nelaborated or highly developed parts which we see in such animals\r\nto-day. Thus the proboscis of the elephant is a greatly elongated\r\nnose; in other words, the elephant is highly \"specialised\" in that\r\ndirection, whereas our Dinoceras had no proboscis, or only a very\r\nslight one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Skull of _Dinoceras mirabile_. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nAgain, the six remarkable bony protuberances of the skull served to\r\nsome extent as horns, and probably were covered with thick bosses of\r\nskin, and did not support true horns like those of our modern oxen and\r\nother ruminants. Speaking of these protuberances, Professor Marsh\r\nsays, \"None of the covering of these elevations, or horn-cores, has,\r\nof course, been preserved; yet a fortunate discovery may perhaps\r\nreveal their nature by the form of a natural cast, as the eye-ball of\r\nthe Oreodon is sometimes thus clearly indicated in the fine Miocene\r\nmatrix which envelops these animals.\" It looks rather as if we have\r\nhere an early stage in the evolution of horns, and it may be that in\r\nthe course of subsequent ages such prominences as those developed into\r\ntrue \"horn cores,\" such as sheep or goats have, while the thick bosses\r\nof skin that covered them slowly developed into the true horns that\r\nare attached to these cores. If this is so, then we have here another\r\ninstance of a \"generalised\" structure. Again, the limbs with their\r\nfive toes tell us at once that the creature's place in Nature is\r\noutside of those two great groups of modern ungulates, or hoofed\r\nquadrupeds, the odd-toed and the even-toed, represented on the one\r\nhand by the horse, rhinoceros, and tapir, on the other by the pig,\r\ncamel, deer, ox, and many other forms. Probably the two groups had not\r\nat this early period branched off from the primitive ungulate stock\r\nwith five toes in each foot, of which the elephant is a living\r\ndescendant, and from which also the Dinoceras must have come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Cast of brain-cavity of _Dinoceras mirabile_.\r\n(After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe limbs were strong and massive, but the brain was remarkably small,\r\nso that our Dinoceras cannot be credited with any high degree of\r\nintelligence: and here again we see an absence of \"specialisation\"\r\ncompared with the sagacious elephant. Professor Marsh has taken casts\r\nof its brain-cavity (see Fig. 44). These casts show that the brain was\r\nsmaller (in proportion to the size of the animal) than in any other\r\nmammal, whether living or extinct--and even less than in some\r\nreptiles! In fact, it was a decidedly reptilian kind of brain.\r\nPerhaps it may seem hardly credible, but so small was the brain of\r\nDinoceras mirabile, that it could have been pulled through the\r\napertures (neural canals) of all the neck vertebræ! In certain\r\nmarsupials of the present day we find an approach to this kind of\r\nbrain. It seems to be an established fact, according to Professor\r\nMarsh, that all the Eocene or earlier Tertiary mammals had small\r\nbrains. His researches among fossil mammals have led him to the\r\nimportant conclusion that, as time went on, the brains of mammals grew\r\nlarger; and thus he has been able to establish his law of brain-growth\r\nduring the Tertiary period, a law which appears to be plainly recorded\r\nin the fossil skulls of succeeding races of ancient mammals. The\r\nimportance of a discovery such as this cannot fail to strike the\r\nimagination of even the most unlearned in geology as being singularly\r\nsuggestive and instructive. It is not difficult to picture these dull,\r\nheavy, slow-moving creatures haunting the forests and palm jungles\r\naround the margin of the great Eocene lake, into the waters of which\r\ntheir carcases from time to time found their way--perhaps swept down\r\nby floods. No footprints have been discovered as yet.\r\n\r\nThe Dinocerata were very abundant for a long time during the middle of\r\nthe Eocene period. The position of their remains suggests that they\r\nlived together in herds, as cattle do now, and they probably found an\r\nabundance of food in the shape of succulent vegetation round the great\r\nlake. Geological evidence points to their sudden extinction before the\r\nclose of the Eocene period; but it is difficult to understand this.\r\nProfessor Marsh thinks that from their sluggish nature they were\r\nincapable of adapting themselves with sufficient rapidity and\r\nreadiness to new conditions, such as may have been brought about by\r\ngeographical changes. It must be admitted, however, that the\r\ngeological record in this region does not give evidence of any sudden\r\nchange. Possibly they may only have migrated to some other region,\r\nwhere their remains have not yet been discovered, or where, for\r\nvarious reasons, their skeletons were not preserved. In this Eocene\r\nlake, where sediments went on being quietly deposited for a long time,\r\nwe have the most favourable conditions for the preservation of the\r\ndifferent forms of life that flourished round its borders.\r\n\r\nIn the museum at Yale College are collected the spoils of numerous\r\nexpeditions to the West, and the many tons of bones lying there are\r\nbelieved to represent the remains of no less than two hundred\r\nindividuals of the Dinocerata. So perfectly have these bones been\r\npreserved by Nature that, even if the creatures had been living now,\r\nthe material for studying their skeletons could hardly be more\r\ncomplete. Professor Marsh recognises three distinct types in this\r\nstrange group of quadrupeds, on each of which a genus has been\r\nfounded. The first and oldest form is the Uintatherium, which takes\r\nits name from the Uinta Mountains. This, as might be expected, is the\r\nmost primitive or least specialised form, and comes from lower strata.\r\nThe most highly developed or specialised form is the Tinoceras, and\r\nthis is found at the highest geological level or \"horizon.\"\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes, and from an intermediate horizon, comes\r\nthe Dinoceras,[41] so that in tracing these animals through the strata\r\nin which they occur the geologist finds that he is following for a\r\nwhile the course of their evolution. Doubtless there were many slight\r\ndifferences presented by the members of this group, but at present it\r\nhas not been found possible to determine the number of species,\r\nalthough about thirty forms more or less distinct have been\r\nrecognised. Professor Marsh says that the specimen of the skull of\r\nDinoceras mirabile, on which the whole order Dinocerata was founded,\r\nis, fortunately, in a very perfect state of preservation, and that it\r\nbelonged to a fully adult animal. Moreover, it was embedded in so soft\r\na matrix that the brain-cavity and the openings leading from it could\r\nbe worked out without difficulty. In removing the skull from the rock,\r\non the high and almost inaccessible cliff where it was found, two or\r\nthree important fragments were lost; but Professor Marsh, after a\r\nlaborious search, recovered them from the bottom of a deep ravine,\r\nwhere they had been washed down and covered up.\r\n\r\n[41] The Dinoceras of Marsh is the same form as Eobasileus of Cope.\r\nUintatherium was discovered by Leidy.\r\n\r\nIt is about twenty-two years since the wonderful forms of life sealed\r\nup within these Eocene lake-deposits first became known to science.\r\nLong before then, however, the wandering Indian had been accustomed to\r\nseeing strange-looking skulls and skeletons that peeped out upon him\r\nfrom the sides of cañons and hills, as the rocks that enclosed them\r\ncrumbled away under the influence of atmospheric agents of change--the\r\nceaseless working of wind, rain, heat, and cold. To his untrained mind\r\nno other explanation suggested itself than the idea that these were\r\nthe bones of his ancestors, which it would be highly impious to\r\ndisturb. _Requiescant in pace!_ So he left them in peace. Perhaps he\r\nbelieved in a former race of human giants; if so, these would be their\r\nbones. Long before Professor Marsh's expeditions, the earliest\r\nsquatters, trappers, and others used to bring back news of marvellous\r\nmonsters grinning from the ledges of rock beneath which they camped.\r\nAt last these tales attracted the notice of some enthusiastic\r\nnaturalists in the eastern States. Professor Leidy obtained a number\r\nof bones, from which he was able to bring to light an extinct creature\r\nat that time unknown to science, namely, the Uintatherium. Professor\r\nCope also described some extinct animals disinterred by himself from\r\nthe same region.\r\n\r\nBut our knowledge of the Dinocerata is chiefly due to Professor Marsh,\r\nwho has despatched one expedition after another, and who, after many\r\nyears of laborious research both in the western deserts and in his\r\nwonderful collection at Yale College, has published a splendid\r\nmonograph on the subject. No trouble and no expense have been spared\r\nin order to obtain material for this great work, and all geologists\r\nmust feel grateful to Professor Marsh for so liberally devoting his\r\ntime and his private resources in order to advance the science of\r\nPalæontology.\r\n\r\nThe region in which the remains occur of the remarkable group of\r\nextinct animals now under consideration, has a peculiar scenery of its\r\nown, unlike anything in Europe. The following graphic description of\r\nits features is from the pen of Sir Archibald Geikie:--[42]\r\n\r\n[42] _Nature_, vol. xxxii. p. 97.\r\n\r\n\"On the high plateau that lies to the west of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nalong the southern borders of the Wyoming territory, the traveller\r\nmoving westwards begins to enter on peculiar scenery. Bare, treeless\r\nwastes of naked stone, rising here and there into terraced ledges and\r\nstrange tower-like prominences, or sinking into hollows where the\r\nwater gathers in salt or bitter pools. Under the cloudless sky, and in\r\nthe clear dry atmosphere, the extraordinary colouring of these\r\nlandscapes forms, perhaps, their weirdest feature. Bars of deep red\r\nalternate with strips of orange, now deepening into sombre browns, now\r\nblazing out again into vermilion, with belts of lilac, buff, pale\r\ngreen, and white. And everywhere the colours run in almost horizontal\r\nbands, running across hollows and river-gorges for mile after mile\r\nthrough this rocky desert. The parallel strips of colour mark the\r\nstrata that cover all this wide plateau country. They are the tints\r\ncharacteristic of an enormous accumulation of sedimentary rocks, that\r\nmark the site of a vast Eocene lake, or succession of lakes, on what\r\nis now nearly the crest of the continent.\"\r\n\r\nIn this strange region the flat-topped hills, table-lands, or\r\nterraces, as they are variously named, seen from lower levels, are\r\nusually called \"buttes,\" especially when they are of limited extent.\r\nThis name is of French origin, and signifies a bank of earth or\r\nrising ground. It is also applied in a limited sense to the more\r\nprominent irregularities of the deeply sculptured slopes of the larger\r\nterraces. These buttes, therefore, vary in extent, from a mere mound\r\nrising slightly above the level of the plains to hills of varied\r\nconfiguration reaching to the level of the broader buttes or terraces.\r\n\r\nThe _débris_ resulting from the continual wearing away, or demolition\r\nof these buttes and terraces, now lies spread out on the plains below.\r\nFrom the lower plains the smaller terraces appear like vast earth-work\r\nfortifications, and when not too much cut up by erosion, remind one of\r\nlong railway embankments. But in many cases the terraces are so much\r\ncut up by narrow ravines that they appear as great groups of naked\r\nbuttes rising from the midst of the plain. Nothing can be more\r\ndesolate in appearance than some of these vast assemblages of\r\ncrumbling buttes, destitute of vegetation, and traversed by ravines,\r\nin which the watercourses in midsummer are almost all dried up. To\r\nthese assemblages of naked buttes, often worn into castellated and\r\nfantastic forms, and extending through miles and miles of territory,\r\nthe early Canadian _voyageurs_ gave the name _Mauvais Terres_. They\r\noccur in many localities of the Tertiary formations west of the\r\nMississippi River. Professor Leidy, who with two friends made an\r\nexpedition in search of fossils to Dry Creek Cañon in this region of\r\nthe \"Bad Lands,\" about forty miles to the southeast of Fort Bridger\r\n(Wyoming), thus describes his impressions:--\r\n\r\n\"On descending the butte to the east of our camp, I found before me\r\nanother valley, a treeless barren plain, probably ten miles in width.\r\nFrom the far side of this valley butte after butte arose and grouped\r\nthemselves along the horizon, and looked together in the distance like\r\nthe huge fortified city of a giant race, the utter desolation of the\r\nscene, the dried-up watercourses, the absence of any moving object,\r\nthe profound silence which prevailed, produced a feeling that was\r\npositively oppressive. When I thought of the buttes beneath our feet,\r\nwith their entombed remains of multitudes of animals for ever\r\nextinct, and reflected upon the time when the country teemed with\r\nlife, I truly felt that I was standing on the wreck of a former\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThese old lake-basins, in which so many forms of life have been sealed\r\nup, all lie between the Rocky Mountains on the east, and the Wasatch\r\nRange on the west, or along the high central plateau of the continent.\r\nAs the mountains were slowly elevated, part of the old sea of the\r\nCretaceous period (that sea in which the \"sea-serpents\" played so\r\nimportant a part) was enclosed and cut off from the ocean. Rivers\r\nbegan to pour their waters into it, so that the waters became less and\r\nless salt, until at last a fresh-water lake, or series of lakes, was\r\nformed. As the upward movement of this region continued these lakes\r\nwere all the while receiving sedimentary materials, such as sand and\r\nmud, from the rivers, until finally they were filled up, but not until\r\nthe sediments had formed a mass of strata over a mile in thickness.\r\nThus we see how favourable were the conditions for a faithful record\r\nof Eocene life-history.\r\n\r\nBut another process was going on which helped to bring them to an end;\r\nfor they were being slowly drained by the rivers that flowed out of\r\nthem, and these rivers kept on continually deepening their channels,\r\nso that we have dry land where the lakes once were. _Now_ the region\r\nis over 6000 feet above the sea, and probably more than one-half of\r\nthese fresh-water deposits have been washed away, mainly through the\r\nColorado River. What is left of the Eocene strata forms the \"Bad\r\nLands.\" The same geological action that has cut up and carved out this\r\nregion into buttes, cañons, cliffs, peaks, and columns of fantastic\r\nshapes, has also brought to light the extinct animals preserved in the\r\nrocks, much in the same way as an old burial-ground, if cut up by\r\nintersecting trenches, might be made to yield up the bones of those\r\nwho for generations had been buried therein.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh first discovered remains of Dinocerata in 1870, while\r\ninvestigating this Eocene lake-basin, which had never before been\r\nexplored. It was here, also, that he found the wonderful series of\r\nfossil horses by means of which he has been able to prove that our\r\nmodern horse is descended from a small quadruped with five toes, and\r\nto show the different stages in its evolution. Here, also, were found\r\nold-fashioned types of carnivorous quadrupeds, of rodents, and of\r\ninsectivorous creatures. But reptiles as well as quadrupeds flourished\r\non the borders of the old lake, for the remains were found of\r\ncrocodiles, tortoises, lizards, and serpents; its waters, too, were\r\nwell stocked with fish.\r\n\r\nEverything here testifies to a long continuance of those conditions\r\nunder which plant and animal life can flourish, namely, a warm\r\nclimate, plenty of food, and freedom from those physical changes\r\nwhich, by altering the geographical features of a country, bring so\r\nmany important consequences in their train. The geological record\r\ntells us that this happy state of things lasted all through the Eocene\r\nperiod, and until the fresh-water lakes had at last been drained away\r\nby their outflowing rivers.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1870, a later Eocene lake-basin was discovered by the same\r\nexploring party, and this Professor Marsh calls the Uinta basin,\r\nbecause it was situated south of the Uinta Mountains. \"In the attempt\r\nto explore it,\" he says, \"our party endured much hardship, and also\r\nwere exposed to serious danger, since we had only a small escort of\r\nUnited States soldiers, and the region visited was one of the\r\nfavourite resorts of the Uinta-Utes. These Indians were then, many of\r\nthem, insolent and aggressive, and since have been openly hostile, at\r\none time massacring a large body of Government troops sent against\r\nthem. Two subsequent attempts ... to explore this region met with\r\nlittle success.\"\r\n\r\nThis lower lake was of later (or upper) Eocene age, and the extinct\r\nanimals preserved in its ancient bed appear to resemble more nearly\r\nthose of the famous Paris basin, referred to in the beginning of this\r\nchapter, than any yet discovered in America. But the basin north of\r\nthe Uinta Mountains, where alone the Dinocerata had been found,\r\noffered so inviting a field that, in the spring of 1871, Professor\r\nMarsh began to explore it systematically. He organised an expedition,\r\nwith an escort of U.S. soldiers, and the work continued during the\r\nwhole season. In this way a large collection was secured. Explorations\r\nwere continued in the spring of the following year, which resulted in\r\nthe discovery of the type specimen of the Dinoceras mirabile. Another\r\nexpedition was organised in 1873, also with an escort of soldiers, and\r\na great many specimens were collected. These researches were continued\r\nduring 1874, and again in 1875, with good results. Since then various\r\nsmall parties have been equipped and sent out by Professor Marsh to\r\ncollect in the same region of the \"Bad Lands;\" and, finally, during\r\nthe entire season of 1882, the work was vigorously prosecuted under\r\nhis direction, and afterwards under the auspices of the United States\r\nGeological Survey. This brief account of the difficulties and\r\nhardships encountered by Professor Marsh and his companions, for which\r\nwe are indebted to his exhaustive monograph, will serve to give some\r\nidea of the nature of those labours, undertaken in the cause of\r\nScience, which he has brought to so successful an issue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the country east of the Rocky Mountains, including the states of\r\nDakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and part of Colorado, Professor Marsh has\r\ndiscovered the remains of yet another strange group of large\r\nquadrupeds. The best known of these is Brontops, of which the skeleton\r\nis seen in Fig. 45. These animals lived after the Dinocerata, namely,\r\nin the Miocene period, and were the largest American mammals of that\r\nperiod. They constitute a distinct family more nearly allied to the\r\nrhinoceros than to any other living form. The skeleton on which Fig.\r\n45 is founded was the most complete of any yet discovered by Professor\r\nMarsh. Portions of it were exhumed at different times, but it was\r\nfirst found in 1874. Our artist has made the restoration seen in Plate\r\nXV. from this skeleton, as figured by Professor Marsh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XV.\r\n\r\nA HUGE EXTINCT MAMMAL FROM NORTH AMERICA. BRONTOPS ROBUSTUS.]\r\n\r\nThis strange group of creatures flourished in great numbers on the\r\nborders of an old lake of Miocene age. The Brontops was a heavy\r\nmassive animal, larger than any of the Dinocerata, with a length of\r\ntwelve feet, not including the tail, and a height of eight feet. The\r\nlimbs are shorter than those of the elephant, which it nearly equalled\r\nin size. As in the tapir, there were four toes to the front limbs, and\r\nthree to the hind limbs. Its skull was of a peculiar shape, shallow,\r\nand very large. That of Brontops ingens is thirty-six inches long, and\r\ntwenty inches between the tips of the two horns, or protuberances. The\r\ncreature was probably provided with an elongated, flexible nose, like\r\nthat of the tapir, but not longer, because the length of the neck\r\nshows that it could reach the ground without the aid of a trunk such\r\nas the elephant's. It is doubtful if the two prominences on the front\r\nof the skull were provided with horns, for, if directed forwards, they\r\nwould interfere with the animal when grazing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Skeleton of Brontops robustus. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOME INDIAN MONSTERS.\r\n\r\n     \"What a glorious privilege it would be, could we live\r\n     back--were it but for an instant--into those ancient times\r\n     when these extinct animals peopled the earth! to see them all\r\n     congregated together in one grand natural menagerie--these\r\n     mastodons and elephants, so numerous in species, toiling\r\n     their ponderous forms and trumpeting their march in countless\r\n     herds through the swamps and reedy forests!\"--Hugh Falconer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry back, against the sun's path, from Wyoming and the\r\nflanks of the Rocky Mountains to the sacred Himalayas--the \"abode of\r\nsnow\"--of Northern India. But if the reader will follow us to that\r\ncountry, we will endeavour to describe two or three out of many\r\nstrange and now lost forms of life brought to light from the famous\r\nSivalik Hills, on the southern border of the Himalayas, for the\r\nknowledge of which Science is greatly indebted to a very distinguished\r\npalæontologist, the late Mr. Hugh Falconer. Together with his friend\r\nCaptain Cautley (afterwards Sir Proby Cautley), he explored this\r\nregion, and their joint arduous labours show that it was at one time\r\ninhabited by a very large and varied group of quadrupeds, together\r\nwith many birds, reptiles, fishes, mollusca, and crustaceans.\r\n\r\nIn this region there lived, throughout a considerable part of the\r\nTertiary period, elephants, of various species, whose skulls and bones\r\nwere found in great numbers; mastodons (a closely allied form); and\r\nseveral species of hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and horse: among\r\nruminants, species of the camel, the ox, the stag, and the antelope,\r\ntogether with a colossal creature unknown before, the Sivatherium,\r\nwhich has never been found elsewhere; a huge tortoise, and various\r\nspecies of carnivora, rodents, and apes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the geography of the region, it appears that the\r\ncontinent of India, at an early period of the Tertiary era, was a\r\nlarge island, situated in a bight, or bay, formed by the Himalayas and\r\nthe Hindoo Koosh range. The valleys of the Ganges and Indus formed a\r\nlong estuary, into which the drainage of the Himalayas poured its silt\r\nand alluvium. Later on, an upheaval took place, converting these\r\nstraits into the plains of India, connecting them with the ancient\r\nisland, and forming the existing continent. The large and varied forms\r\nwhose remains now lie \"sealed within the iron hills\" then spread over\r\nthe continent, from the Irrawaddi to the mouths of the Indus, two\r\nthousand miles; and north-west to the Jhelum, fifteen hundred miles.\r\nAfter a long interval of repose, another great upheaval took place,\r\nwhich threw up a strip of the plains of India, crumpled and ridged it\r\nup to form the Sivalik Hills, and at the same time increased the\r\nelevation of the Himalayas by many thousands of feet.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to show that such events as these must have been\r\nfollowed by changes in climate, for the climate of a region depends\r\nlargely on its physical features--the proportion of land and water,\r\nthe presence of hills and mountain ranges, and their height; and it is\r\nconsidered probable that the physical changes above mentioned helped\r\nto bring about the extinction of this most interesting and ancient\r\nfauna. Throughout the latter part of the Tertiary era it is well known\r\nto geologists that the climate of Europe was becoming gradually\r\ncolder, until at last a glacial period, or \"Ice Age,\" was experienced,\r\nduring which Northern Europe was subjected to an arctic climate, and\r\nthe great ice-sheet seems to have been slowly retiring and melting\r\naway in the early part of the Stone Age. But in India there has been\r\nno such decrease in temperature, and it enjoyed in Tertiary times as\r\nwarm a climate as it now has, so that both animal and vegetable life\r\ncontinued to flourish vigorously.\r\n\r\nBy the Sivalik (or Sewalik) Hills is meant that range of lower\r\nelevations which stretches along the south-west foot of the Himalayas,\r\nfor the greater portion of their extent from the Indus to the\r\nBrahmapootra, where those rivers respectively debouche from the hills\r\ninto the plains of India. It extends for nearly a thousand miles, and\r\nit appears to have been entirely built up of alluvial _débris_, washed\r\ndown from the Himalayas into that sea which we have already referred\r\nto as having once separated the plains of India from the great range\r\nnow forming its northern boundary. The strata thus formed were\r\nsubsequently upheaved to form the Sivalik Hills. Thus we see that one\r\nmountain range may help to form another one running parallel to\r\nitself. The name is derived from Siva, or Mahadeo, the Hindoo god;\r\nthese hills, as well as the Himalayas, being connected in Hindoo\r\nmythology in various ways with the history of Siva.\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer and Captain Cautley soon found that they had \"struck oil\"\r\nin the Sivalik Hills, or, in other words, had come upon one of\r\nNature's great graveyards, full of material most valuable to the\r\npalæontologist--one which, extending for hundreds of miles, might\r\nperhaps prove to be as rich in relics of the world's \"lost creations\"\r\nas the lake-basin in Wyoming, where Professor Marsh discovered his\r\nDinocerata and other extinct types.\r\n\r\nLet us give Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley their due. They found\r\nthemselves suddenly confronted with a perfect mine of wealth, in a far\r\ncountry, where the ordinary means resorted to by men of science for\r\ndetermining extinct types and species, by comparison with living\r\nforms, were not to be obtained, for there were no libraries and no\r\nmuseums of comparative anatomy in that remote quarter of India. But\r\nDr. Falconer was not the man to be baffled by such drawbacks, which\r\nwould have deterred and discouraged some men. He appealed to the\r\nliving forms that abounded in the surrounding forests, rivers, and\r\nswamps, and took toll of them to supply the want. Nature herself\r\nbecame his library and his museum. Skeletons of all kinds were\r\nprepared; the extinct forms he collected were compared with their\r\nnearest living allies, and a valuable series of \"Memoirs\" by himself\r\nand Captain Cautley was the result.[43]\r\n\r\n[43] These appeared in the _Asiatic Researches_, the _Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal_, and in the _Geological Transactions_ of\r\nthe London Geological Society.\r\n\r\nThe Sivalik explorations soon attracted attention in Europe, and in\r\n1837 the Wollaston Medal, in duplicate, was awarded for their\r\ndiscoveries to Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley by the Geological\r\nSociety, the fountain of geological honours in England; while the\r\nvalue of the distinction was enhanced by the terms in which the\r\nPresident, Sir Charles Lyell, was pleased to announce the award. This\r\nis what he said: \"When Captain Cautley and Dr. Falconer first\r\ndiscovered these remarkable remains, their curiosity was awakened, and\r\nthey felt convinced of their great scientific value; but they were not\r\nversed in fossil osteology [the study of bones], and, being stationed\r\non the remote confines of our Indian possessions, they were far\r\ndistant from any living authorities or books on comparative anatomy to\r\nwhich they could refer. The manner in which they overcame these\r\ndisadvantages, and the enthusiasm with which they continued for years\r\nto prosecute their researches, when thus isolated from the scientific\r\nworld, are truly admirable. Dr. Royle has permitted me to read a part\r\nof their correspondence with him, when they were exploring the Sivalik\r\nMountains, and I can bear witness to their extraordinary energy and\r\nperseverance. From time to time they earnestly requested that Cuvier's\r\nworks might be sent out to them, and expressed their disappointment\r\nwhen, from various accidents, these volumes failed to arrive. The\r\ndelay, perhaps, was fortunate; for, being thrown entirely upon their\r\nown resources, they soon found a museum of comparative anatomy in the\r\nsurrounding plains, hills, and jungles, where they slew the wild\r\ntigers, buffaloes, antelopes, and other Indian quadrupeds, of which\r\nthey preserved the skeletons, besides obtaining specimens of all the\r\nreptiles which inhabited that region. They were compelled to see and\r\nthink for themselves, while comparing and discriminating the different\r\nrecent and fossil bones, and reasoning on the laws of comparative\r\nosteology, till at length they were fully prepared to appreciate the\r\nlessons which they were taught by the works of Cuvier.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Captain Cautley presented his vast collection, the result of\r\nten years' unremitting labour and great personal outlay, to the\r\nBritish Museum, the Geological Society having declined to accept it,\r\nas it was beyond their means of accommodation. Its extent and value\r\nmay be estimated from the fact that it filled 214 large chests, the\r\naverage weight of each of which amounted to 4 cwt., and that the\r\ncharges on its transmission to England alone, which were defrayed by\r\nthe Government of India, amounted to £602. Dr. Falconer's selected\r\ncollection was divided between the India House and the British Museum;\r\nthe greater part was presented to the former, but a large number of\r\nunique or choice specimens, required to fill up blanks, were presented\r\nto the latter. The greater part of the specimens in the British Museum\r\nwere still unarranged and embedded in their matrix. In 1844 a memorial\r\nwas presented to the Court of Directors of the Honourable East India\r\nCompany, pointing out the desirability of having the specimens in the\r\nnational collection prepared, arranged, and displayed, and also of\r\npublishing an illustrated work, which would convey to men of science\r\nin both hemispheres a knowledge of the contents of the Sivalik Hills,\r\nand suggesting Dr. Falconer as the person most fitted to superintend\r\nthe work. The Government of the time, under Sir Robert Peel, made a\r\ngrant of £1000 to enable the collection to be exhibited in the British\r\nMuseum, and Dr. Falconer was entrusted with the work. Besides this, a\r\nlarge illustrated work, entitled _Fauna Antiqua Sivalensis_, was\r\nbegun, but owing to the demands upon Dr. Falconer's time, and his\r\nsubsequent death, this work was not completed, although nine out of\r\nthe twelve parts originally contemplated were finished. The great\r\nIndian collection of fossils, mainly the gift of Sir Proby Cautley\r\n(the specimens of which, stupendous in their size, and in fine\r\npreservation, were prepared, identified, and arranged by Dr.\r\nFalconer), has long constituted one of the chief ornaments of the\r\ncollection at the British Museum--now removed to the Natural History\r\nMuseum, Cromwell Road, South Kensington.\r\n\r\nOther collections of fossils from the Sivalik Hills have been\r\npresented to the Museum of Edinburgh University by Colonel Colvin, and\r\nto the Oxford University by Mr. Walter Ewer. When it is remembered\r\nthat these collections have since been increased tenfold, and that the\r\nremains were either excavated or found in the _débris_ of cliffs, and\r\nthat the explored surface bears a very small proportion to that which\r\nhas not yet been investigated, one may conceive how prodigious must\r\nhave been the number of animals that lived together in the former\r\nplains of India, even when every allowance is made for the bones\r\nhaving accumulated during many successive generations in the Sivalik\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nFrom this large and important collection we select two of special\r\ninterest for brief notice here, namely, the Sivatherium,[44] and an\r\nimmense tortoise known as the Colossochelys.\r\n\r\n[44] From _Siva_, the Hindoo god; and Greek, _therion_, a beast.\r\n\r\nThe first of these monsters was a remarkable form of animal, unlike\r\nanything living. In size it surpassed the largest rhinoceros, and was\r\nbigger than any living ruminant. Altogether, it was one of the most\r\nremarkable forms of life yet detected in the more recent strata. It\r\nhad two pairs of horns on its head--two short and quite simple ones in\r\nfront, and two larger ones, more or less expanded, behind them. From\r\nthe character of these long horn-cores, which are prolongations of the\r\nskull, it may be concluded that the Sivatherium was a gigantic\r\nruminant with four horns. A cast of the original skull, with the\r\nhorn-cores restored from actual parts, in the collection and\r\nelsewhere, has been placed on a stand in the centre of the long\r\ngallery of fossil vertebrates at South Kensington (Stand I) near to\r\nthe case containing the skull and other portions of the skeleton (see\r\nFig. 46). There is also hanging on the wall near, a clever painting by\r\nBerjeau, representing the creature as it may have appeared when alive.\r\nThe entire skeleton, partly restored, is shown in Fig. 47, with a\r\nconjectural outline of the body. A hornless skull of a nearly allied\r\nanimal from the same strata and locality is placed with that of the\r\nSivatherium, and was considered by Dr. Falconer and others to be the\r\nskull of the hornless female (also represented as such in the above\r\npicture referred to); but is now, by more recent writers, regarded as\r\na separate genus, viz. the Helladotherium, so named because the\r\nremains were first discovered at Pikermi, near Athens, Greece (ancient\r\nHellas). (See Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Skull of _Sivatherium giganteum_, from the\r\nSivalik Hills, Northern India.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVI.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC HOOFED MAMMAL, SIVATHERIUM GIGANTEUM.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sivalik Hills, Northern India.\r\n\r\nAn allied form, _Helladotherium_, is seen on the left]\r\n\r\nIn the Sivatherium we have a new type which seems to connect together\r\ntwo families at the present time well marked off from each other,\r\nnamely, the giraffe and the antelope. Its teeth resemble those of the\r\nformer animal, while in its four horns it resembles a certain antelope\r\n(Antilope quadricornis). The head in certain respects shows\r\nresemblances to that of the ox, but the upper lip must have been\r\nprolonged into a short proboscis, or trunk, like that of the tapir.\r\nThe form and proportions of the jaw agree closely with the\r\ncorresponding parts of a buffalo. But no known ruminant, fossil or\r\nexisting, has a jaw of such large size, the average dimensions being\r\nmore than double those of a buffalo. The skull is the best known part\r\nof the animal, but Captain Cautley came across some of the bones of\r\nthe limbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Skeleton of _Sivatherium giganteum_.]\r\n\r\nThe Colossochelys atlas,[45] or gigantic fossil tortoise of India,\r\nsupplies a fit representative of the tortoise which sustained the\r\nelephant and the infant world in the fables of the Pythagorean and\r\nHindoo cosmogonies.

Atlas was\r\nsupposed to sustain the world on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe carapace, or buckler, of the shell of this crawling monster is\r\nsimilar in general form to the large land-tortoises of the present\r\nday.[46] The shell is estimated to have been at least six feet long.\r\nThe limbs were probably similar to those of a modern land-tortoise,\r\nand the limb-bones are of huge size--a single humerus, or arm-bone,\r\nmeasuring 28 inches. Probably the foot was as large as that of a\r\nrhinoceros. A restored cast of a young individual stands at the West\r\nend of the fossil reptile gallery, South Kensington (Stand Z on plan).\r\nLength of the shield, 10 feet[47] (see Fig. 48).\r\n\r\n[46] Giant tortoises of the present day live on islands--where they\r\nhave escaped competition with large carnivora and other foes--such as\r\nthe Aldabra group, N.W. of Madagascar, in the Mascarenes, which\r\ncomprise Mauritius and Rodriguez; and the Galapagos, or \"Tortoise\r\nIslands,\" off the coast of South America. When Mr. Darwin visited the\r\nlatter islands he saw the relics, as it were, of a family of huge\r\ntortoises, which lived there in abundance a few years before, and was\r\nable to verify many interesting facts which had been recorded by\r\nPorter in 1813, who stated that some of those captured by him weighed\r\nfrom 300 to 400 lbs., and that on one island they were 5-1/2 feet\r\nlong. Those of one island differed from those of another. Some had\r\nlong necks. After Mr. Darwin's visit the process of extermination went\r\non. At the present time it is most probable that the gigantic\r\ntortoises are very rare where formerly they were so abundant. One of\r\nthese great tortoises is that of Abingdon Island, in the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, of which there is a fine stuffed specimen in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum (Reptile Gallery). It has a very long neck, and a small\r\nflat-topped head with a short snout. It weighed originally 201 lbs.\r\nThe Indian tortoises of the present day are not of large size. See the\r\nfine specimens in the Natural History Museum--Reptile Gallery (left\r\nwing of the building).\r\n\r\n[47] Dr. Falconer's estimate was much too great, so that this model is\r\ntoo large. Mr. Lydekker prefers to drop the generic term\r\nColossochelys, and call it Testudo Atlas. In length it was only\r\none-third greater than Testudo elephantina of the Galapagos Islands.\r\n\r\nThe first fossil remains of this colossal tortoise were discovered by\r\nDr. Falconer and Captain Cautley in 1835, in the Tertiary strata of\r\nthe Sivalik Hills. At the period when it was living--probably the\r\nPliocene--there was great abundance and variety of life on the scene,\r\nfor its remains were found to be associated with those of many great\r\nquadrupeds, such as the elephant, mastodon, rhinoceros, horse, camel,\r\ngiraffe, sivatherium, and many other mammals. The Sivalik fauna also\r\nincluded a great number of reptiles, such as crocodiles, lizards, and\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Restored figure of gigantic tortoise,\r\n_Colossochelys atlas_, from the Sivalik Hills, Northern India.]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the remains of the Colossochelys atlas were\r\ncollected during a period of eight or nine years, along a range of\r\nabout a hundred miles of hilly country. Consequently, they belong to a\r\nlarge number of individuals, varying in size and age. They were met\r\nwith in crushed fragments, contained in upheaved strata, which have\r\nundergone considerable disturbance, so that it is improbable that an\r\nentire uncrushed specimen will ever be found. When the first\r\nfragments, in huge shapeless masses, were found by the discoverers,\r\nthey were utterly at a loss what to make of them, and for many months\r\ncould do nothing more than look upon them in bewildered and nearly\r\nhopeless admiration. But no sooner was the clue found to a single\r\nspecimen than every fragment moved into its place so as to form a\r\nconsistent whole.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible at present to say, with any degree of certainty,\r\nwhether this colossal tortoise survived into the human period; but at\r\nleast there is no evidence against the idea, and Dr. Falconer shows it\r\nis quite possible that the frequent allusions to a gigantic tortoise\r\nin Hindoo and other mythologies are to be explained on the supposition\r\nthat the creature was seen by the men of a prehistoric age. Other\r\nspecies of tortoises and turtles that were coeval with the\r\nColossochelys have lived on to the present day. So have other\r\nreptiles, for some of the crocodiles now living in India appear to be\r\nidentical with the forms dug out of the Sivalik Hills. In the absence\r\nof direct geological evidence, we must fall back on traditions.\r\n\r\nNow, there are traditions connected with the speculations of nearly\r\nall Eastern nations with regard to the world (cosmogonies) that refer\r\nto a tortoise of such gigantic size as to be associated with the\r\nelephant in their fables. The question therefore arises--Was this\r\ntortoise a creature of the imagination, or was the idea of it drawn\r\nfrom a living reality? Besides a tradition current among the Iroquois\r\nIndians of North America, referring to the important share which the\r\ntortoise had in the formation of the earth, there are several cases in\r\nancient history bearing on the same point. Thus, we find in the\r\nPythagorean doctrine the infant world represented as having been\r\nplaced on the back of an elephant, which was sustained on a huge\r\ntortoise. Greek and Hindoo mythologies were undoubtedly related to\r\neach other, and accordingly we find in the Hindoo accounts of the\r\nsecond Avatar of Vishnoo, that the ocean is said to have been churned\r\nby means of the mountain placed on the back of the king of the\r\ntortoises, and the serpent Asokee used as the churning-rope. Again,\r\nVishnoo was said to have assumed the form of the tortoise, and to have\r\nsustained the created world on his back to make it stable. This fable\r\nhas taken such a firm hold of the Hindoos, that to this day they\r\nbelieve the world rests on the back of a tortoise (see Fig. 49). In\r\nthe narratives of the feasts of the bird-demigod, Garuda, the\r\ntortoise again figures largely, and Guruda is said on one occasion\r\nto have appeased his hunger at a certain lake where an elephant and a\r\ntortoise were fighting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--The elephant victorious over the tortoise,\r\nsupporting the world, and unfolding the mysteries of the _Fauna\r\nSivalensis_. From a sketch in pencil in one of Dr. Falconer's\r\nnote-books, by the late Professor Edward Forbes.]\r\n\r\nThese three instances, in each of which there is a distinct reference\r\nto a gigantic form of tortoise, comparable in size with the elephant,\r\nsuggest the question whether we are to regard the idea as a mere\r\nfiction of the imagination, like the Minotaur or the Chimæra, or as\r\nfounded on a living tortoise. Dr. Falconer points out that it seems\r\nunlikely that such fables could have been suggested by any of the\r\nsmall species of tortoises now living in India, and consequently is\r\ninclined to think that the monster was seen by man many centuries ago,\r\nlong before he began to write history. We have already alluded to the\r\nlarge number of mammalian forms of life that were contemporary with\r\nthe Sivatherium and Colossochelys, but if we examine this old Sivalik\r\nfauna we find it presents several very interesting features. In the\r\nfirst place, it exhibits a wonderful richness and variety of forms,\r\ncompared to the living fauna of India. Take the pachydermata, for\r\ninstance--an old order established by Cuvier to include the\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant, etc.--and we find there were, in\r\nthe period under consideration, about five times the number of species\r\nnow known in India. Elephants and mastodons, too, of various species\r\nabounded. So it is with the ruminants; besides a large number of\r\nspecies allied to those now living, such as the ox, buffalo, bison,\r\ndeer, antelope, musk-deer, and others, there were giraffes and camels,\r\nas well as the strange Sivatherium. And so it is with the other\r\norders, such as carnivora, rodents, insectivora, etc.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this great and varied fauna of the past shows a striking\r\nresemblance to that of India at the present day. Darwin found the same\r\nresemblance in South America; and now it is accepted as a general law,\r\nthat the living fauna of a country resembles its extinct fauna,\r\nespecially that of the latest geological period. Dr. Falconer found\r\nthat India's living fauna is but, as it were, a remnant of that which\r\nit once possessed.\r\n\r\nThirdly, this extinct Sivalik fauna presents a singular mixture of old\r\nand new forms. And lastly, it points to a very different geographical\r\ndistribution of animals. Thus the giraffe, the hippopotamus, and the\r\nostrich are _now_ confined to Africa. Facts such as these serve to\r\nthrow light on the geography of the past; but we cannot stay to\r\nenlarge on that subject here.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said about the fossil elephants and mastodons from the\r\nSivalik Hills, so fully described by Dr. Falconer, but since chapters\r\nxiii. and xiv. deal with elephants, we must reserve our remarks till\r\nthen, only alluding here to one striking form from the Sivalik Hills,\r\nnamely, the Elephas ganesa, the tusks of which were more than ten feet\r\nin length, and much less curved than those of the mammoth. A very fine\r\nspecimen of the head and tusks may be seen in the gallery of fossil\r\nmammals in the Natural History Museum (Gallery I, Stand D).\r\n\r\nWith the following eloquent passage from Dr. Falconer's \"Memoirs,\" we\r\ntake leave of the remarkable Sivalik fauna, hoping that future\r\ngeologists will endeavour to follow his example and bring to light yet\r\nother \"lost creations\" from that region, so rich in fossils, yet\r\ncomparatively unexplored. Would that the English Government could see\r\ntheir way to follow the example of the United States, and send out a\r\nscientific expedition to explore this wonderful region! There can be\r\nno doubt that a rich harvest lies waiting there to be reaped.\r\n\r\n\"What a glorious privilege it would be, could we live back--were it\r\nbut for an instant--into those ancient times when these extinct\r\nanimals peopled the earth! to see them all congregated together in one\r\ngrand natural menagerie--these mastodons and elephants, so numerous in\r\nspecies, toiling their ponderous forms and trumpeting their march in\r\ncountless herds through the swamps and reedy forests! to view the\r\ngiant Sivatherium, armed in front with four horns, spurning the\r\ntimidity of his race, and, ruminant though he be, proud in his\r\nstrength, and bellowing his sturdy career in defiance of all\r\naggression! And then the graceful giraffes, flitting their shadowy\r\nforms like spectres through the trees, mixed with troops of large as\r\nwell as pigmy horses, and camels, antelopes, and deer! And then, last\r\nof all, by way of contrast, to contemplate the colossus of the\r\ntortoise race, heaving his unwieldy frame, and stamping his toilsome\r\nmarch along plains which hardly look over strong to sustain him!\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly it would be a heart-stirring sight to behold! But although\r\nwe may not actually enjoy the effect of the living pageant, a still\r\nhigher order of privilege is vouchsafed to us. We have only to light\r\nthe torch of philosophy, to seize the clue of induction, and, like the\r\nProphet Ezekiel in the vision, to proceed into the valley of death,\r\nwhen the graves open before us and render forth their contents; the\r\ndry and fragmented bones run together, each bone to his bone; the\r\nsinews are laid over, the flesh is brought on, the skin covers all,\r\nand the past existence--_to the mind's eye_--starts again into being,\r\ndecked out in all the lineaments of life. 'He who calls that which\r\nhath vanished back again into being, enjoys a bliss like that of\r\ncreating.' Such were the words of the philosophical Niebuhr, when\r\nattempting to fill up the blanks in the fragmentary records of the\r\nancient Romans, whose period in relation to past time dates but as of\r\nyesterday. How much more highly privileged, then, are we, who can\r\nrecall, as it were, the beings of countless remote ages, when man was\r\nnot yet dreamed of! not only this, but if we use discreetly the lights\r\nwhich have been given to us, we may invoke the spirit of the winds,\r\nand learn how _they_ were tempered to suit the natures of these\r\nextinct beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nGIANT SLOTHS AND ARMADILLOS.\r\n\r\n    \"Injecta monstris terra dolet suis.\"\r\n\r\n    Horace, _Odes_, book iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange, considering how much we owe to North\r\nAmerica, had the great South American continent not enriched our\r\nknowledge of past forms of life on the globe. But such is not the\r\ncase. The honours are, as it were, divided, although it must be\r\nadmitted that the North American extinct forms at present known are\r\nfar more numerous. There are, however, two or three \"Extinct Monsters\"\r\nof very great interest which once had a home in South America--in that\r\nstrange region of the Pampas, where the naturalist of the present day\r\nfinds so much to excite his interest. Of these the present chapter\r\ntreats.\r\n\r\nThe Megatherium[48] (Cuvier) was a gigantic mammal allied to sloths and\r\nant-eaters, and perhaps to the armadillos. In its skull and teeth this\r\ncolossus of the past resembled the sloths, in its limbs and backbone\r\nit resembled the ant-eaters, while in size it surpassed the largest\r\nrhinoceros (Plate XVII.). The famous, but imperfect, specimen at\r\nMadrid was for a long time the principal if not the only source of\r\ninformation with regard to this extinct genus, and for nearly a\r\ncentury it remained unique.\r\n\r\n[48] Greek--_megas_, great; _therion_, beast.\r\n\r\nLater on, however, the zeal and energy of Sir Woodbine Parish, his\r\nlate Majesty's _chargé-d'affaires_ at Buenos Ayres, greatly helped to\r\naugment the materials for arriving at a just conclusion with regard\r\nto its proper place in the animal kingdom. According to one writer,\r\nSpain formerly possessed considerable parts of three different\r\nskeletons. The first and most complete is that which is preserved in\r\nthe royal cabinet at Madrid. This was sent over in 1789, by the\r\nMarquis of Loreto, Viceroy of Buenos Ayres, with a notice stating that\r\nit was found on the banks of the river Luxan. In 1795 a second\r\nspecimen arrived from Lima, and other portions, probably not very\r\nconsiderable, were in the possession of Father Fernando Scio, to whom\r\nthey had been presented by a lady from Paraguay. But two German\r\ndoctors, Messrs. Pander and D'Alton, who published in 1821 a beautiful\r\nmonograph on the subject, state that they were unable in 1818 to find\r\nany traces of either the Lima specimen or that which had belonged to\r\nFernando Scio.\r\n\r\nThe remains collected by Sir Woodbine Parish were discovered in the\r\nriver Salado, which runs through the flat alluvial plains (Pampas) to\r\nthe south of the city of Buenos Ayres, after a succession of three\r\nunusually dry seasons, \"which lowered the waters in an extraordinary\r\ndegree, and exposed parts of the pelvis to view as it stood upright in\r\nthe bottom of the river.\"[49]\r\n\r\n[49] \"Some Account of the Remains of the _Megatherium_ sent to England\r\nfrom Buenos Ayres, by Woodbine Parish, Jun., Esq., F.R.S.,\" by Wm.\r\nClift, Esq., F.R.S., _Geological Transactions_, second series, vol.\r\niii. p. 437.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVII.\r\n\r\nCAST OF A SKELETON OF MEGATHERIUM AMERICANUM.\r\n\r\nSet up in the Natural History Museum.]\r\n\r\nThis and other parts having been carried to Buenos Ayres by the\r\ncountry people, were placed at the disposal of Sir Woodbine Parish by\r\nDon Hilario Sosa, the owner of the property on which the bones were\r\nfound. A further inquiry was instituted by Sir Woodbine; and on his\r\napplication, the governor granted assistance, the result of which was\r\nthe discovery of the remains of two other skeletons on his\r\nExcellency's properties, at no great distance from the place where the\r\nfirst had been found. It was in the year 1832 that Sir Woodbine Parish\r\nsent his valuable collection of bones from Buenos Ayres, and presented\r\nthem to the Royal College of Surgeons. These specimens formed the\r\nsubject of Mr. Clift's memoir above quoted. But even then the\r\nmaterials were not complete for a thorough knowledge of the bony\r\nframework of the Megatherium, and it was not till 1845, when more\r\nremains (discovered near Luxan, 1837) reached this country, that\r\nProfessor Owen was able to clear up one or two doubtful details. These\r\nwere purchased by the trustees of the British Museum, and casts of the\r\nbones were taken. Among the various writings by learned men on the\r\nsubject, Professor Owen's masterly description stands pre-eminent;\r\nindeed, he was the only one to solve the riddle, to thoroughly explain\r\nthe structure of this giant sloth, and to show how its food was\r\nobtained.[50] Neither Cuvier, nor the German doctors, nor Mr. Clift had\r\nsucceeded in so doing.\r\n\r\n[50] His views are expounded in his _Memoir on the Megatherium, or\r\nGiant Ground Sloth of America_, 1861, which is beautifully\r\nillustrated. The Royal Society gave £100 (part of a Government grant\r\nof £1000) to enable Professor Owen to carry out this important work.\r\n\r\nIn the Natural History Museum (Stand O, Gallery No. 2 on plan) is a\r\ncast representing the animal nearly erect, and grasping a tree. This\r\nmagnificent cast (see Plate XVII.) represents an animal eighteen feet\r\nin length, and its bones are more massive than those of the elephant.\r\nFor instance, the thigh-bone is nearly thrice the thickness of the\r\nsame bone in the largest of existing elephants, the circumference\r\nbeing equal to the entire length. To a comparative anatomist several\r\nstriking indications of great strength present themselves; thus, not\r\nonly the very forms of the bones themselves mean strength, but their\r\nsurfaces, ridges, and crests are everywhere made rough for the firm\r\nattachment of powerful muscles and tendons. In the fore part of the\r\nbody the skeleton is _comparatively_ slender, but the hind quarters\r\nshow enormous strength and weight combined. The tail, also, is very\r\npowerful and massive. The fore limbs are long, and evidently\r\nconstructed for the exertion of great force. How this force was\r\napplied we shall see presently. In both sets of limbs we notice\r\npowerful claws, such as might be used for scratching up the ground\r\nnear the roots of a tree, and it was at one time thought that this was\r\nthe way in which the creature obtained its leafy food, namely, by\r\ndigging up trees by the roots and then devouring the leaves. But\r\nProfessor Owen had another explanation.\r\n\r\nAs in the living sloths and armadillos (edentata[51]), there are no\r\nteeth in the fore part of the jaw. The molar teeth, of which there are\r\nfive on each side of the upper jaw, and four in the lower, are hollow\r\nprismatic cylinders, straight, seven to nine inches long, and\r\nimplanted in deep sockets. There are no other teeth, but these are\r\ncomposed of different substances, and so arranged that, as the tooth\r\nwears, the surface always presents a pair of transverse ridges, thus\r\nproducing a dental apparatus well suited for grinding up vegetable\r\nfood. In the elephants, which live on similar food, the grinding is\r\neffected by great molar teeth, which are replaced by new ones as the\r\nold ones are worn away. In the Megatherium, however, only _one_ set of\r\nteeth was provided; but these, by constant upward growth, and\r\ncontinual addition of new matter beneath, lasted as long as the animal\r\nlived, and never needed to be renewed.\r\n\r\n[51] This word, which means _toothless_, is misleading. All the\r\nedentata, however, agree in having no front, or incisor, teeth.\r\n\r\nOn looking at the model so skilfully set up at South Kensington, and\r\nespecially at the front part of the skull, it will be seen that the\r\nsnout and lips must have been somewhat elongated, possibly into a\r\nslight proboscis like that of the tapir. The specimens of the lower\r\njaw in the wall-case close by show that it was much prolonged and\r\ngrooved. This fact must be interpreted to mean that the creature\r\npossessed a long and powerful tongue, aided by which it could, like\r\nthe giraffe, strip off the small branches of the trees which it had\r\nbroken or bent down within its reach.\r\n\r\nA bony shield (or carapace) of a great armadillo was found with one of\r\nthe specimens described by Mr. Clift, and Buckland and others thought\r\nit belonged to the Megatherium; but Owen afterwards showed, by most\r\nclear and convincing reasoning from the skeleton, that the Megatherium\r\ncould not have been protected as armadillos are, by such a shield (see\r\np. 190).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVIII.\r\n\r\nGREAT GROUND-SLOTH OF SOUTH AMERICA, MEGATHERIUM AMERICANUM.\r\n\r\nLength 18 feet.]\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the question how it obtained its food. The idea of\r\ndigging round trees with its claws in order to uproot them, must be\r\npartly, if not entirely, given up; for Professor Owen has proved, by a\r\nmasterly piece of reasoning, that this cumbrous creature, instead of\r\nclimbing up trees as modern sloths do, actually pulled down the tree\r\nbodily, or broke it short off above the ground by a _tour de force_,\r\nand, in order to do so, sat up on its huge haunches and tail as on a\r\ntripod, while it grasped the trunk in its long powerful arms!\r\nMarvellous as this may seem, it can be shown that every detail in its\r\nskeleton agrees with the idea. Of course there would be limits to\r\npossibilities in this direction, and the larger trees of the period\r\nmust have been proof against any such Samson-like attempts on the part\r\nof the Megatherium; but when the trunk was too big, doubtless it\r\npulled down some of the lower branches. Plate XVIII. is a restoration,\r\nby our artist, of the South Kensington skeleton.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the extinct sloths of South America, Mr. Darwin thus\r\ndescribes Professor Owen's remarkable discovery: \"The habits of these\r\nMegatheroid animals were a complete puzzle to naturalists until\r\nProfessor Owen solved the problem with remarkable ingenuity. Their\r\nteeth indicate by their simple structure that these animals ... lived\r\non vegetable food, and probably on the leaves and small twigs of\r\ntrees; their ponderous forms and great strong curved claws seem so\r\nlittle adapted for locomotion, that some eminent naturalists believed\r\nthat, like sloths, to which they are intimately related, they\r\nsubsisted by climbing, back downwards, on trees, and feeding on the\r\nleaves. It was a bold, not to say preposterous, idea to conceive even\r\nantediluvian trees with branches strong enough to bear animals as\r\nlarge as elephants. Professor Owen, with far more probability,\r\nbelieves that, instead of climbing on trees, they pulled the branches\r\ndown to them, and tore up the smaller ones by the roots, and so fed\r\non the leaves. The colossal breadth and weight of their hinder\r\nquarters, which can hardly be imagined without having been seen,\r\nbecome, on this view, of obvious service instead of being an\r\nencumbrance; their apparent clumsiness disappears. With their great\r\ntails and huge heels firmly fixed like a tripod in the ground, they\r\ncould freely exert the full force of their most powerful arms and\r\ngreat claws.\"[52]\r\n\r\n[52] _Journal of Researches._\r\n\r\nTo this we may add Dean Buckland's description,[53] \"His entire frame\r\nwas an apparatus of colossal mechanism, adapted exactly to the work it\r\nhad to do; strong and ponderous in proportion as this work was heavy,\r\nand calculated to be the vehicle of life and enjoyment to a gigantic\r\nrace of quadrupeds, which, though they have ceased to be counted among\r\nthe living inhabitants of our planet, have, in their fossil bones,\r\nleft behind them imperishable monuments of the consummate skill with\r\nwhich they were constructed. Each limb and fragment of a limb form\r\ncoordinate parts of a well-adjusted and perfect whole.\"\r\n\r\n[53] _Bridgewater Treatise._\r\n\r\nAfter reading these descriptions, it is not difficult to form a mental\r\npicture of the great beast laying siege to a tree, and to conceive the\r\nmassive frame of the Megatherium convulsed with the mighty wrestling,\r\nevery vibrating fibre reacting upon its bony attachment with the force\r\nof a hundred giants; extraordinary must be the strength and\r\nproportions of the tree if, when rocked to and fro, to right and left,\r\nin such an embrace, it can long withstand the efforts of its\r\nassailant. It yields, the roots fly up, the earth is scattered wide\r\nupon the surrounding foliage, and the tree comes down with a\r\nthundering crash, cracking and snapping the great boughs like glass.\r\nThen the coveted food is within reach, and the giant reaps the reward\r\nof his Herculean labours.\r\n\r\nSir Woodbine Parish thought that the Megatherium fed on the Agave, or\r\nAmerican aloe.\r\n\r\nAnother form of extinct sloth found in the same region is the\r\nMylodon. Though of smaller size, it was much bigger than any living\r\nsloth, and attained a length of eleven feet. It has the same general\r\nstructure, but the head and jaws are somewhat different, and more like\r\nthe recent forms. A nearly perfect and original skeleton of Mylodon\r\ngracilis has been set up beside its huge relative's cast in the same\r\ngallery at the Natural History Museum. The crowns of its molar teeth\r\nare flat instead of being ridged; hence its name, which signified\r\n\"mill-toothed.\"\r\n\r\nYet another was the Scelidotherium[54] with its long limbs. Darwin\r\nobtained an almost entire skeleton of one of these. It was as large as\r\na polar bear. Speaking of his discovery, he says, \"The beds containing\r\nthe fossil skeletons consist of stratified gravel and reddish mud; a\r\nproof that the elevation of the land has been inconsiderable since the\r\ngreat quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding plains, and the\r\nexternal features of the country were then very nearly the same as\r\nnow. The number of the remains of these quadrupeds embedded in the\r\nvast estuary deposits which form the Pampas and cover the granitic\r\nrocks of Banda Oriental must be extraordinarily great. I believe a\r\nstraight line drawn in any direction through the country would cut\r\nthrough some skeleton or bones. As far as I am aware, not one of these\r\nanimals perished, as was formerly supposed, in the marshes or muddy\r\nriver-beds of the present land, but their bones have been exposed by\r\nthe streams intersecting the subaqueous deposit in which they were\r\noriginally embedded. We may conclude that the whole area of the Pampas\r\nis one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic quadrupeds.\"[55]\r\n\r\n[54] Greek--_scelis_, limb; _therion_, beast.\r\n\r\n[55] _Journal of Researches._\r\n\r\nThe genus Scelidotherium comprises a number of species and presents\r\ncharacters more or less intermediate between Megatherium and some\r\nother genera. The skull is low and elongated, and shows an approach to\r\nthat of the modern ant-eater. The feet also are different from those\r\nof Megatherium (see Fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Skeleton of _Scelidotherium_. (After\r\nCapellini.)]\r\n\r\nThese monster sloths inhabited South America during the latest\r\ngeological period, known as the Pleistocene. During part of that time\r\nNorth America, as well as Northern Europe and Asia, were invaded by a\r\ngreat ice-sheet, and an arctic climate prevailed. It is therefore very\r\nprobable that while the mammoth and the mastodon were roaming over\r\nNorth America, giant sloths and armadillos were monarchs of the\r\nsouthern continent. What cause, or causes, led to the extermination of\r\nthe giant sloths and armadillos is still a matter of speculation. One\r\nwriter suggests an explanation that seems to deserve consideration.\r\nThe southern parts of this great continent are even now subject to\r\nlong-continued droughts, sometimes lasting for three years in\r\nsuccession, and bringing great destruction to cattle. In fact, the\r\ndiscoveries related above were rendered possible by several successive\r\ndry seasons. It is argued that the upright position of most of the\r\nskeletons found _in situ_ seems to suggest that the creatures must\r\nhave been mired in adhesive mud sufficiently firm to uphold the\r\nponderous bones after the flesh had decayed. A long drought would\r\nbring the creatures from the drained and parched country to the\r\nrivers, reduced by want of rain to slender streams running between\r\nextensive mud-banks; and it is possible that, in their anxious efforts\r\nto reach the water, they may have only sunk deeper and deeper in the\r\nmud until they were engulfed. This idea is strengthened by\r\ninformation supplied to Mr. Darwin when in these parts (recorded in\r\nhis _Journal_). An eye-witness told him that during the _gran seco_,\r\nor great drought, the cattle in herds of thousands rushed into the\r\nParana, and, being exhausted by hunger and thirst, were unable to\r\ncrawl up the muddy banks, and so were drowned.\r\n\r\nIn the last great drought, from 1830 to 1832, it is probable\r\n(according to calculations made) that the number of animals that died\r\nwas over one million and a half. The borders of all the lakes and\r\nstreamlets in the province were long afterwards white with their\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882 reports were published of the discovery of large\r\nfootprints--supposed to be human--in a certain sandstone near Carson,\r\nNevada, U.S. The locality was the yard of the State prison, and the\r\ntracks were uncovered in quarrying stone for building purposes. Many\r\ndifferent kinds of tracks were found, some of which were made by an\r\nanimal allied to the elephant; some resembled those of the horse and\r\ndeer; others seem to have been made by a wolf, and yet others by large\r\nbirds. Those supposed to have been made by human giants were in six\r\nseries, each with alternate right and left tracks. The stride is from\r\ntwo and a half to over three feet, and each footprint is about\r\neighteen inches long. Now, those who believed these tracks to be human\r\nmust have found it hard to explain how a giant with a foot some\r\neighteen inches long had a stride no longer than that of an ordinary\r\nman of to-day, to say nothing of the fact that the straddle was\r\neighteen to nineteen inches! For these and other reasons Professor\r\nMarsh has exploded the idea of their having been made by men, and gave\r\ngood reasons to show that they were probably made by a giant sloth,\r\nsuch as the Mylodon above mentioned, the remains of which have been\r\ndiscovered in the same strata. They agree in size, in stride, and in\r\nwidth between the right and left impressions, very closely with the\r\ntracks that a Mylodon would have made, and it seems that those of the\r\nfore feet were afterwards impressed by the hind feet, so that each\r\ntrack contains two impressions.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has some knowledge of natural history will not need to\r\nbe told that the sloths of the present day, inhabiting the same region\r\nas their gigantic ancestors, are of small size, and live among the\r\nbranches of the trees, together with the spider monkeys, howlers, and\r\nother apes. An interesting question to the evolutionist is--How did\r\nthe change take place from the old huge and heavy types to the smaller\r\nand agile types of the present day? Can it be possible that the more\r\ndifficult and tedious task of pulling down branches and even stems of\r\ntrees, in order to devour the leaves, was abandoned for the simpler\r\nmethod of climbing up and feeding among the branches? It certainly\r\nlooks as if a change of this kind had been instituted at some distant\r\nperiod in the past--distant, that is, to _us_, but not very remote\r\ngeologically. The present method seems so much simpler that we need\r\nnot be surprised at its adoption, for Nature is ever ready to\r\nencourage and assist those among the children of Life which can hit\r\nupon and adopt new and improved methods, either in obtaining food or\r\nrepelling enemies, or other duties imposed upon them. Now, suppose\r\nthat, in accordance with the well-known fact that variations in the\r\noffspring of animals are constantly cropping up, some considerably\r\nsmaller variety of Megatherium, or Mylodon, or other now extinct type,\r\nappeared on the scene, and, by virtue of its comparative agility,\r\ncould climb a tree and feed among the branches instead of pulling them\r\ndown: then, as Darwin has so well explained, Nature would seize upon\r\nthis accidental variation, and give it an advantage over its more\r\nawkward relations. Its offspring, too, would inherit the same\r\ncharacteristics, they would adopt the same habits, and, in time, as\r\n\"natural selection\" further increased these characters, by weeding out\r\nthose that were unfit while fostering all those that were neither\r\nlarge nor clumsy in climbing trees, a new race of sloths would arise.\r\nThis new race, it can well be imagined, would in time outstrip the old\r\nrace in numbers, for successful races multiply while unsuccessful\r\nones diminish. Victory is not always to the great and the strong, for\r\ncunning and quickness are often of more service than mere brute\r\nstrength; and perhaps the sloths, as we now see them in the Brazilian\r\nforests, have hit upon \"a new and original plan\" by means of which the\r\nold colossal forms described above have been driven out of the field,\r\nand so exterminated by a process of competition. Such an explanation\r\nwould be in thorough harmony with modern teaching, and, as the other\r\nsuggestion about long-continued droughts, given on p. 184, may not\r\nappear satisfactory to some of our readers, we offer this theory for\r\nwhat it may be worth.\r\n\r\nA few words about these modern sloths may not be out of place; for we\r\nshall better understand how they have succeeded in the struggle for\r\nexistence when we know something of their manner of life; and in some\r\nways they still resemble their great ancestors.\r\n\r\nThere are few animals which exhibit in a greater degree what appears\r\nto the careless observer to be _deformity_ than the sloth, and none\r\nthat have, on this account, been more maligned by naturalists. Buffon,\r\nand many of the older zoologists, were eloquent upon the supposed\r\ndefects of the unfortunate sloth. These writers gravely asserted that\r\nwhen the sloth ascends a tree, for the purpose of feeding upon its\r\nleaves, it is so lazy that it will not quit its station until every\r\ntrace of verdure is devoured. Some of them even went so far as to\r\nassert that when the sloth was compelled, after thus stripping a tree,\r\nto look out for a fresh supply of food, it would not take the trouble\r\nto descend the tree, but just allowed itself to drop from a branch to\r\nthe ground. Even Cuvier, who ought to have known better, echoes this\r\ntale, and insinuates that Nature, becoming weary of perfection,\r\n\"wished to amuse herself by producing something imperfect and\r\ngrotesque,\" when the sloths were formed; and he proceeds, with great\r\ngravity, to show the \"inconvenience of organisation,\" which, in his\r\nopinion, rendered the sloths unfit for the enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that, on the ground, these animals are about the most\r\nawkward creatures that can well be imagined. Their fore legs are much\r\nlonger than their hind ones; all their toes are terminated by very\r\nlong curved claws, and the general structure of the animal is such as\r\nto prevent them from walking in the manner of an ordinary quadruped,\r\nfor they are compelled to rest on the sides of their hands and feet.\r\nThus they appear the most helpless of animals, and their only means of\r\nprogression consists in hooking their claws to some inequality in the\r\nground, and thus dragging their bodies painfully along. But in their\r\nnatural home, amongst the branches of trees, all these seeming\r\ndisadvantages vanish--nay, the very peculiarities of structure which\r\nrender the sloths objects of pity on the ground, are found to render\r\nthem admirably adapted to their peculiar mode of life. The sloth is a\r\nsmall animal, rarely more than two feet in length, and covered with\r\nwoolly hair--probably a protection against snakes, its only enemies.\r\nIt spends nearly the whole of its life in the trees. There, safe from\r\nthe prowling animals on the ground below, it hangs like a hammock from\r\nthe bough, and even travels along the branches with its body\r\ndownwards, using its long claws like grappling-irons.\r\n\r\nIt looks slothful enough when asleep, for then it resembles a bunch of\r\nrough hair, and a jumble of limbs close together, hanging to a branch;\r\nbut when awake it is industrious in its search for nice twigs and\r\nleaves, and moves along with considerable activity. When the\r\natmosphere is still, the sloth keeps to its tree, feeding on the\r\nleaves and twigs, but when there is wind, and the branches of\r\nneighbouring trees come in contact, the opportunity is seized, and the\r\nanimal moves along the forest under the shady cover of the boughs. The\r\nIndians have a saying that \"when the wind blows the sloth begins to\r\ncrawl;\" and the reason is quite evident, for they cannot jump, but can\r\nhang, swing, and crawl suspended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIX.\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC ARMADILLO, GLYPTODON ASPER.\r\n\r\nFrom Buenos Ayres. Length 8 feet 7 inches.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to the old gigantic representative of the armadillo,\r\nthe Glyptodon.[56] To the eye it resembles more or less an armadillo,\r\nand has a huge cuirass, or large plate of armour, covering the whole\r\nof the body, but allowing the head to show in front, while the legs\r\ncome out beneath. Both head and tail were also protected with armour.\r\nThe great shield, or carapace, in most of the extinct armadillos, is\r\ncomposed of long plates of regular shape, closely united at their\r\nedges (sutures) so as to form a solid piece. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat this creature, having no movable bands, as living armadillos\r\nhave, could not roll itself up into a ball. The fore feet have thick,\r\nshort toes, instead of long ones, such as their modern representatives\r\nhave; and from this we may infer that they were not in the habit of\r\nburrowing or of seeking their food underground. The family of\r\nGlyptodonts seem to have been chiefly confined to the continent of\r\nSouth America, but some species are known to have extended their range\r\nas far as Mexico, and Texas into North America. A good deal of\r\nconfusion has arisen with regard to the classification of these\r\nold-fashioned armadillos, on account of the fact that isolated\r\nspecimens of their tails have often been found, and these cannot\r\nalways be referred to the right carapaces. For example, it should be\r\npointed out here that the tail represented in Fig. 51 really belongs\r\nto another genus, known as Hoplophorus.[57]\r\n\r\n[56] So named by Sir R. Owen, in reference to the sculptured aspect of\r\nthe grinding surface of the teeth. Greek--_glupho_, I carve; _odous,\r\nodontos_, tooth.\r\n\r\n[57] Greek--_Hoplon_, armour; _phero_, I bear.\r\n\r\nIn Glyptodon asper (Plate XIX.), the scutes of the carapace had a\r\nbeautiful rosette-like sculpture, while the sheath of the tail was\r\nentirely composed of a series of movable rings, ornamented with large\r\nprojecting tubercles. The vertebræ of the backbone are almost entirely\r\nfused together into a long tube, and also are joined to the under\r\nsurface of the great shield, to which the ribs are united. The\r\ncheek-teeth are sixteen in number, four above and four below on each\r\nside. These are channelled with two broad and deep grooves, which\r\ndivide the surface into three distinct lobes. Hence the name of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe tessellated carapace of the Glyptodon was at first thought to\r\nbelong to the Megatherium, with which the remains were associated, but\r\nProfessor Owen clearly demonstrated the impossibility of this idea.\r\n\r\nFig. 51 represents Glyptodon clavipes (Owen) from the Pleistocene\r\ndeposits of Buenos Ayres; but the reader will gain a much better idea\r\nof the animal by inspecting the splendid specimen of Glyptodon asper\r\nin the Natural History Museum, near the centre window at the east end\r\nof the Pavilion (Glass-case Q on plan).\r\n\r\nPlate XIX. is a restoration of another species by our artist.[58]\r\n\r\n[58] This plate is based on a beautiful drawing in a Spanish work,\r\n_Anales del Museo publico Buenos Aires_. G. Burmeister, M.D., Phil. D.\r\nTomo Segundo.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons (which the reader is\r\nrecommended to visit) there are several most valuable specimens of\r\nthese extinct armadillos from South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Extinct Gigantic Armadillo, _Glyptodon\r\nclavipes_, from Pleistocene deposits, Buenos Ayres. (The tail sheath\r\nhere represented probably belongs to another genus, Hoplophorus.)]\r\n\r\nArmadillos belong, with sloths and ant-eaters, to the same family of\r\nso-called toothless animals (edentata) with no front teeth, though one\r\nor two forms really are toothless. Those of the present day have their\r\nbony armour divided up into a series of bands, so that they can roll\r\nthemselves up, more or less, into balls. They burrow under the ground,\r\nwhere they get their food to a certain extent, and live a safe life,\r\nprotected by their casque of mail. Their only enemies seem to be the\r\nmonkeys, and one of the tricks of the young monkeys in the American\r\nforests is, when they find an armadillo away from home, to pull its\r\ntail unmercifully, and try to drag it about. Snakes cannot hurt them.\r\nMr. Hudson, in his most interesting book, _A Naturalist in La Plata_,\r\nnarrates how he watched an armadillo kill a snake and then devour it.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the anatomy of the armadillo, we shall find that its\r\nbones greatly resemble those of the sloth, but still there are a few\r\ndifferences. It is a burrowing animal, and therefore requires great\r\npower of scratching and tearing the ground. Why the colossal forms of\r\narmadillo should have become extinct and only small ones survived to\r\nthe present time, is one of the many and perplexing problems presented\r\nby the study of extinct animals. One would have thought from its size\r\nand strength that the Glyptodon had been built, like Rome, for\r\neternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MAMMOTH.\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, where the huntsman winds his matin horn,\r\n      And the couched hare beneath the covert trembles;\r\n    Where shepherds tend their flocks, and grow their corn\r\n      Where fashion in our gay Parade assembles--\r\n    Wild horses, deer, and elephants have strayed,\r\n      Treading beneath their feet old Ocean's races.\"\r\n\r\n    Horace Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany are the traditions and tales that have clustered round the\r\nMammoth.[59] He is, however, no fabulous product of the imagination,\r\nlike the dragon, for he has actually been seen in the flesh, and not\r\nonly _seen_, but eaten, both by men and animals! But, for all that,\r\nmen's minds have been busy for centuries past making up tales, often\r\nof the wildest description, about him; and it is little wonder that a\r\ncreature whose bones are found in the soils and gravels, etc., over\r\nmore than half the world, and whose body has been seen frozen in\r\nSiberian ice, should have given rise to many tales and superstitions.\r\nTo students of folk-lore these legends are of considerable interest,\r\nand to some extent also to men of science. To the latter, however,\r\none of its many points of interest is that palæontology may be said to\r\nhave been founded on the Mammoth. Cuvier, the illustrious founder of\r\nthe science of organic remains, was enabled, by his accurate and\r\nminute knowledge of the structures of living animals, to prove to his\r\nastonished contemporaries that the Mammoth bones and teeth, so\r\nplentifully discovered in Europe, were not such as could have belonged\r\nto any living elephant, and consequently that there must have existed,\r\nat some previous period in the world's history, an elephant of a\r\ndifferent kind, and quite unknown to naturalists. This was a new idea,\r\nand accordingly one that met with opposition as well as incredulity.\r\n\r\n[59] The word _Mammoth_ is thought by Pallas and Nordenskiöld to be of\r\nTartar origin. The former asserts that the name originated in the word\r\n_mamma_, which signifies earth (the Mammoth being found frozen in the\r\nearth). It was introduced into the languages of Western Europe about\r\ntwo centuries ago, from the Russian. But other writers have attempted\r\nto prove that it is a corruption of the Arabic word _Behemoth_, or\r\n\"great beast,\" which in the Book of Job signifies an unknown animal.\r\nIn an ancient Chinese work, of the fifth century before Christ, it is\r\nspoken of under the name _tien-schu_, that is to say, \"the mouse which\r\nhides itself.\" The Chinese legends are referred to on p. 199.\r\n\r\nIt was thought in those days that whatever animals lived in the past\r\n_must_ have resembled those now inhabiting the world, and the idea of\r\nextinct types unknown to man, and unknown to the regions where their\r\nbones were found embedded below the soil, was of so novel and\r\nstartling a character as to appear incredible. Besides, the Mosaic\r\naccount of Creation made no direct reference to extinct animals, and\r\ntherefore the notion was not to be entertained.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to note the devices to which people resorted in order to\r\ncombat this revolutionary teaching. Thus, when Cuvier first announced\r\nthe discovery of the fossil remains of the elephant, hippopotamus, and\r\nrhinoceros in the superficial deposits of continental Europe, he was\r\ngravely reminded of the elephants introduced into Italy by Pyrrhus in\r\nthe Roman wars, and afterwards in the Roman triumphal processions or\r\nthe games at the Colosseum.\r\n\r\nIt was only by means of minute anatomical differences that he was able\r\nto show that the bones and teeth of these elephants must have belonged\r\nto a species unlike those now living. But these differences proved too\r\nsubtle for even scientific men to appreciate, so slight was their\r\nknowledge of anatomy compared with his; so that they were either\r\ndisallowed or explained away.\r\n\r\nBut he was not to be beaten, and appealed to the fact that similar\r\nremains occurred in Great Britain, whither neither Romans nor others\r\ncould have introduced such animals. These are his words: \"If, passing\r\nacross the German Ocean, we transport ourselves into Britain, which in\r\nancient history by its position could not have received many living\r\nelephants besides that one which Cæsar brought thither, according to\r\nPolycenus; we shall, nevertheless, find these fossils in as great\r\nabundance as on the Continent.\"\r\n\r\nAnother crushing answer to the absurd explanations of Cuvier's\r\ncountrymen was added by the sagacious Dean Buckland, who pointed out\r\nthat in England, as on the Continent, the remains of elephants are\r\naccompanied by the bones of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus, animals\r\nwhich not even Roman armies could have subdued or tamed! Owen also\r\nadds that the bones of fossil elephants are found in Ireland, where\r\nCæsar's army never set foot.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1796 that Cuvier announced that the teeth and bones of the\r\nEuropean fossil elephants were distinct in species from both the\r\nAfrican and the Indian elephant, the only two living species (El.\r\nafricanus and El. indicus). This fundamental fact opened out to him\r\nnew views about the creation of the world and its inhabitants, and a\r\nrapid glance over other fossil bones in his collection showed him the\r\ntruth and the value of this great idea (namely, the existence of\r\nextinct types), to which he consecrated the rest of his life. Thus\r\npalæontology may be said to have been founded on the Mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of elephants have, on account of their common\r\noccurrence in various parts of the world, attracted a great deal of\r\nattention, both from the learned and the unlearned. In the North of\r\nEurope they have been found in Ireland, in Germany; in Central Europe,\r\nin Poland, Middle and South Russia, Greece, Spain, Italy; also in\r\nAfrica, and over a large part of Asia. In the New World they have been\r\nfound abundantly in North America. But in the frozen regions of\r\nSiberia its tusks, teeth, and bones are met with in very great\r\nabundance. According to Pallas, the great Russian savant, there is not\r\nin the whole of Asiatic Russia, from the Don to the extremity of the\r\nTchutchian promontory, any brook or river on the banks of which some\r\nbones of elephants and other animals foreign to these regions have not\r\nbeen found. The primæval elephants (Mammoth, Mastodon, etc.) appear to\r\nhave formerly ranged over the whole northern hemisphere of the globe,\r\nfrom the fortieth parallel to the sixtieth, and possibly to near the\r\nseventieth degree of latitude.\r\n\r\nJust as the North American Indian regards the great bones of Professor\r\nMarsh's extinct Eocene mammals that peep out from the sides of buttes\r\nand cañons, as belonging to his ancestors, so we find that in all\r\nparts of the world the bones of extinct elephants have, on account of\r\ntheir great size (and partly from a certain resemblance, in some, to\r\nbones of the human skeleton), been regarded as testifying to the\r\nformer existence of giants, heroes, and demigods. To the present day\r\nthe Hindoos consider such remains as belonging to the _Rakshas_, or\r\nTitans,--beings that figure largely in their ancient writings.\r\nTheophrastus, of Lesbos, a pupil of Aristotle, appears to have been\r\nthe first to record the discovery of fossil ivory and bones. These\r\nwere probably obtained by the country people from certain deposits in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and are mentioned five hundred years later by\r\nPausanias. Several Greek legends and traditions appear to be founded\r\non such discoveries.\r\n\r\nThus the Greeks mistook the knee-bone of an elephant for that of Ajax.\r\nIn like manner the supposed body of Orestes, thirteen feet in length,\r\ndiscovered by the Spartans at Tegea, doubtless was the skeleton of\r\nsome elephant. In the isle of Rhodes, in Sicily, and near Palmero,\r\nSyracuse, and at many other places, similar remains have afforded a\r\nbasis for stories of giants. In fact, so much has been said by old\r\nwriters on this subject, that whole volumes might be filled with such\r\nmatter. Let one or two examples suffice.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1613 some workmen in a sand-pit near the castle of\r\nChaumont, not far from St. Antoine, found some bones (probably of the\r\nMammoth or Mastodon) of the nature of which they were entirely\r\nignorant, and many of them they broke up. But a certain surgeon named\r\nMazuyer, hearing of the discovery, bought the bones, and announced\r\nthat he had himself discovered them in a tomb thirty feet long,\r\nbearing in Gothic characters the inscription, \"Teutobochus Rex.\" This\r\nwas a barbarian king who invaded Gaul at the head of the Cimbri, and\r\nwas defeated near Aix, in Provence, by Marius, who brought him to Rome\r\nto grace his triumphal procession. Mazuyer reminded his credulous\r\nreaders that, according to the testimony of Roman authors, the head of\r\nthis king was larger than any of the trophies borne upon the lances in\r\ntriumph, and for a time his marvellous story was accepted. The\r\nskeleton of this pretended giant-king was exhibited in many cities of\r\nFrance and Germany, and also before Louis XII., who took great\r\ninterest in it. The imposture was detected and exposed by Riolan, and\r\nthus a great controversy arose, and numerous pamphlets were written on\r\nboth sides. The skeleton remained at Bordeaux till the year 1832, when\r\nit was sent to the Museum of Natural History at Paris, where it may\r\nstill be seen. It is needless to say that, on its arrival there, M.\r\nBlainville at once recognised it as being that of an elephant--a\r\nMastodon, in fact.\r\n\r\nAnother giant-story may be narrated as follows. In the year 1577 some\r\nlarge bones were discovered, through the uprooting of an oak by a\r\nstorm, in the Canton of Lucerne, in Switzerland. These bones were\r\nafterwards declared by the celebrated physician and professor at\r\nBasle, Felix Plater, to be those of a giant. This learned man\r\nestimated the height of the giant at nineteen feet! and made a drawing\r\nthereof, which he sent to Lucerne. The bones have since nearly all\r\nvanished, but Blumenbach, at the beginning of this century, saw enough\r\nof them to prove their elephantine nature. The good people of Lucerne,\r\nhowever, being reluctant to abandon their giant, have, since the\r\nsixteenth century, made him the supporter of their city arms.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Christopher, at Valence, possessed an elephant's\r\ntooth, which was shown as the tooth of St. Christopher. As this relic\r\nwas \"bigger than a man's fist,\" it is difficult to picture what idea\r\nthe people entertained of their saint!\r\n\r\nIn 1564 two peasants observed on the banks of the Rhone, along a\r\nslope, some great bones sticking out of the ground. These they carried\r\nto the neighbouring village, where they were examined by Cassanion,\r\nwho lived at Valence, and was the author of a treatise on giants (_De\r\nGigantibus_). Cuvier concluded from this writer's description of the\r\ntooth that it belonged to an elephant.\r\n\r\nOtto de Guericke, famous as the inventor of the air-pump, in 1663\r\nwitnessed the discovery of a fossil elephant, with its tusks\r\npreserved. These he mistook for horns; so did even the illustrious\r\nLeibnitz, who created out of his own imagination a strange animal,\r\nwith a great horn in the middle of its forehead, as the creature to\r\nwhich these remains belonged! One is reminded of Bret Harte's amusing\r\n_jeu d'esprit, The Society upon the Stanislaus_--\r\n\r\n    \"Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed there,\r\n    From those same bones, an animal that was extremely rare;\"\r\n\r\nand how the members of this learned society came to blows over their\r\nfossil bones, and hurled them at one another--\"till the skull of an\r\nold mammoth caved the head of Thomson in.\" But in this case, the\r\n\"animal that was extremely rare\" was believed in for a long time, and\r\nLeibnitz's \"fossil unicorn\" was universally accepted throughout\r\nGermany for more than thirty years. At last, however, a complete\r\nskeleton of a Mammoth was discovered, and recognised as belonging to\r\nan elephant; but the unicorn was not given up without a keen\r\ncontroversy.[60]\r\n\r\n[60] The writer is indebted for much of the information here given\r\nwith regard to the discoveries of Mammoth bones, and legends founded\r\nthereon, to M. Figuier's _World before the Deluge_.\r\n\r\nNear the city of Constadt, in the year 1700, a great quantity of bones\r\nand tusks of elephants were discovered, after excavations had been\r\nmade by order of the reigning duke, who had been informed by a soldier\r\nof Würtemberg of the presence of bones in the soil. In this way some\r\nsixty tusks were unearthed. The whole ones were preserved, but those\r\nwhich were broken were given to the Court physician, who made use of\r\nthem for medicinal purposes. After this the \"Ebur fossile,\" or\r\n\"Unicornu fossile,\" was freely used by the German doctors, until the\r\ndiscovery of the bone-caves of the Hartz, when it became too abundant\r\nto pass for true unicorn, and consequently lost much of its repute.\r\n\r\nIn our own country elephantine remains have also given rise to strange\r\ntales. The village of Walton, near Harwich, is famous for the\r\nabundance of Mammoth remains, which lie along the base of the\r\nsea-cliffs, mixed with the bones of horses, oxen, and deer. \"The more\r\nbulky of these fossils,\" says Professor Owen, \"appear to have early\r\nattracted the notice of the curious. Lambard, in his _Dictionary_,\r\nsays that 'in Queen Elizabeth's time bones were found, at Walton, of a\r\nman whose skull would contain five pecks, and one of his teeth as big\r\nas a man's fist, and weighed ten ounces. These bones had sometimes\r\nbodies, not of beasts, but of men, for the difference is manifest.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority, there is reason to believe that\r\ninstances have occurred in Great Britain in which, with due care and\r\nattention, a more or less entire skeleton of the Mammoth might have\r\nbeen secured. He mentions the case of the discovery of a number of\r\nMammoth bones by some workmen in a brick-ground, near the village of\r\nGrays, in Essex. But most unfortunately, in their ignorance, they\r\nbroke up these valuable relics, and sold the fragments, for three\r\nhalf-pence a pound, to a dealer in old bones! This somewhat lucrative\r\ntraffic went on for over half a year before the matter came to the\r\nnotice of Mr. R. Ball, F.G.S., who recovered some fine bones from the\r\nmen, and thus rescued them from the destruction that awaited them.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be hoped that some day our National Treasure House at\r\nSouth Kensington may be enriched with a complete Mammoth skeleton from\r\nBritish soil.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, as might be expected, heard of the Mammoth long before\r\nEuropeans did, and they have some strange stories about it. In the\r\nnorthern part of Siberia, so great is the abundance of Mammoth tusks,\r\nthat for a very long period there has been a regular export of Mammoth\r\nivory, both eastward to China and westward to Europe. Even in the\r\nmiddle of the tenth century an active trade was carried on at Khiva in\r\nfossil ivory, which was fashioned into combs, vases, and other\r\nobjects, as related by an Arab writer of that time. Middendorf\r\nreckoned that the number of fossil tusks which have yearly come into\r\nthe market, during the last two centuries, has been at least a hundred\r\npairs--an estimate which Nordenskiöld considers as well within the\r\nmark. They are found all along the line of the shore between the mouth\r\nof the Obi and Behring Straits, and the further north a traveller\r\ngoes, the more numerous does he find them. The soil of Bear Island and\r\nof the Liachoff Islands (New Siberia) is said to consist only of sand\r\nand ice with such quantities of Mammoth bones that it appears as if\r\nthey were almost made up of bones and tusks. Every summer numbers of\r\nfishermen make for these islands to collect fossil ivory, and during\r\nthe winter immense caravans return laden with Mammoth tusks. The\r\nconvoys are drawn by dogs, and in this way the ivory reaches both the\r\nancient Eastern and the newer Western markets.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the Chinese legends that the frozen bodies of\r\nMammoths have for ages past been either seen by, or reported to,\r\nmembers of the celestial empire, for it is mentioned in some of their\r\nold books as an animal that lives underground. In a great Chinese work\r\non natural history, written in the sixteenth century, the following\r\nquaint description occurs: \"The animal named _tien-schu_, of which we\r\nhave already spoken, in the ancient work upon the ceremonial entitled\r\n_Lyki_ [a work of the fifth century before Christ] is called also\r\n_fyn-schu_, or _yn-schu_, that is to say, 'the mouse that hides\r\nitself.' It always lives in subterranean caverns; it resembles a\r\nmouse, but is of the size of a buffalo or ox. It has no tail; its\r\ncolour is dark; it is very strong, and excavates caverns in places\r\nfull of rocks and forests.\" Another writer says, \"The _fyn-schu_\r\nhaunts obscure and unfrequented places. It dies as soon as it is\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun or moon; its feet are short in\r\nproportion to its size, which causes it to walk badly. Its tail is a\r\nChinese ell in length. Its eyes are small, and its neck short. It is\r\nvery stupid and sluggish. When the inundations of the river\r\n_Tamschuann-tuy_ took place [in 1571] a great many _fyn-schu_ appeared\r\nin the plain; it fed on the roots of the plant _fu-kia_.\"\r\n\r\nAn old Russian traveller, who, in 1692, was sent by Peter the Great as\r\nambassador to the Emperor of China, mentions the discovery of the\r\nheads and legs of Mammoths in frozen soil. After referring to these\r\ndiscoveries, he says, \"Concerning this animal there are very different\r\nreports. The heathens of Jakutsk, Tungus, and Ostiaks say that they\r\ncontinually, or at least, by reason of the very hard frosts, mostly\r\nlive underground, where they go backwards and forwards; to confirm\r\nwhich they tell us that they have often seen the earth heaved up when\r\none of these beasts was upon the march, and, after he passed, the\r\nplace sink in, and thereby make a deep pit. They further believe that\r\nif this animal comes so near to the surface of the frozen earth as to\r\nsmell the air, he immediately dies, which they say is the reason that\r\nseveral of them are found dead on the high banks of the river, where\r\nthey unawares came out of the ground. This is the opinion of the\r\ninfidels concerning these beasts, which are never seen. But the old\r\nSiberian Russians affirm that the Mammoth is very like the elephant,\r\nwith this difference only, that the teeth of the former are firmer,\r\nand not so straight as those of the latter.... By all I could gather\r\nfrom the heathens, no person ever saw one of these beasts alive, or\r\ncan give any account of its shape; so that all we heard said on this\r\nsubject arises from bare conjecture only.\"\r\n\r\nBut making all allowance for the gross absurdities of these accounts,\r\nit is clear that they are based on descriptions--probably by the\r\nTungusian fishermen--of carcases that have been washed out of the\r\nfrozen soil by rivers in flood time. Now that we are in possession of\r\ntrustworthy accounts, we can understand how these strange tales arose\r\namong an ignorant and superstitious people, such as the fishermen of\r\nthese inhospitable shores.\r\n\r\nWe will now put before the reader the true accounts given by Adams[61]\r\nand Benkendorf.\r\n\r\n[61] Abridged from _Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St.\r\nPetersburg_, vol. v. London, 1819.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 a Tungusian, named Schumachoff, who generally went to hunt and\r\nfish at the peninsula of Tamut after the fishing season of the Lena\r\nwas over, had constructed for his wife some cabins on the banks of the\r\nlake Oncoul, and had embarked to seek along the coasts for Mammoth\r\ntusks. One day he saw among the blocks of ice a shapeless mass, but\r\ndid not then discover what it was. In 1800 he perceived that this\r\nobject was more disengaged from the ice, and that it had two\r\nprojecting parts; and towards the end of the summer of 1801 the entire\r\nside of the animal and one of his tusks were quite free from ice. In\r\n1803 the enormous mass fell by its own weight on a bank of sand. It\r\nwas a frozen Mammoth! In 1804 Schumachoff came to his Mammoth, and\r\nhaving cut off the tusks, exchanged them with a merchant for goods.\r\nTwo years afterwards Mr. Adams, the narrator of the story, traversed\r\nthese distant and desert regions, and found the Mammoth still in the\r\nsame place, but sadly mutilated. The people of the neighbourhood had\r\ncut off the flesh, and fed their dogs with it during the scarcity.\r\nWild beasts, such as white bears, wolves, and foxes, also had fed on\r\nit, and the traces of their footsteps were seen around. The skeleton\r\nwas complete all except one leg, but the flesh had almost all gone.\r\nThe head was covered with a dry skin, one of the ears was seen to be\r\ncovered with a tuft of hairs. All these parts suffered more or less\r\ninjury in transport for a distance of 7330 miles to St. Petersburg,\r\nyet the eyes have been preserved. This Mammoth was a male, with a long\r\nmane on its neck, but both tail and proboscis had disappeared. The\r\nskin is of a dark grey colour, covered with a reddish wool and black\r\nhairs. The entire carcase was nine feet four inches high. The skin of\r\nthe side on which the carcase had lain was detached by Mr. Adams, for\r\nit was well preserved, but so heavy was it that ten persons found\r\ngreat difficulty in transporting it to the shore. The white bears,\r\nwhile devouring the flesh, had trodden into the ground much of the\r\nhair belonging to the carcase, but Mr. Adams was able by digging to\r\nprocure about sixty pounds' weight of hair. In a few days the work was\r\ncompleted, and he found himself in possession of a treasure which\r\namply compensated him for the fatigues and dangers of the journey as\r\nwell as the expense of the enterprise. When first seen, this Mammoth\r\nwas embedded in clear pure ice, which forms in that coast escarpments\r\nof considerable thickness, sloping towards the sea, the top of which\r\nis covered with moss and earth. If the account of the Tungusians can\r\nbe trusted, the carcase was some way below the surface of the ice when\r\nfirst seen. Arrived at Takutsk, Mr. Adams purchased a pair of tusks\r\nwhich he believed to belong to this Mammoth, but there is reason to\r\ndoubt whether he did get the right tusks. They are nine feet six\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Skeleton of Mammoth, _Elephas primigenius_\r\n(partly restored), in the Museum at Brussels. Drawn from a photograph,\r\nby J. Smit.]\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of this specimen, the fame of which may be said to have\r\nspread all over the world, is now set up in the Museum of the St.\r\nPetersburg Academy, and the skin still remains attached to the head\r\nand feet. A part of the skin and some of the hair were sent by Mr.\r\nAdams to Sir Joseph Banks, who presented them to the Museum of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons.[62] A photograph of the skeleton as it now\r\nstands, may be seen on the wall of the big Geological Gallery at South\r\nKensington (No. I. on plan), near the specimens of Mammoth tusks. But\r\nit should be pointed out that _the tusks are put on the wrong way_;\r\nfor they curve outwards instead of inwards, thus presenting a somewhat\r\ngrotesque appearance. For this reason we have not reproduced the\r\nfamiliar woodcut based on an engraving in the memoir already referred\r\nto.[63] But we give, instead, a sketch taken from a photograph (also on\r\nthe wall in gallery No. I.) of a fine skeleton in the Brussels Museum\r\n(Fig. 52). Here the tusks are seen correctly inserted. We must also\r\ndraw the reader's attention to the remarkably fine specimen (glazed\r\ncase E on plan) consisting of the skull and both tusks complete, found\r\nat Ilford in Essex.\r\n\r\n[62] A specimen of the hair of a mammoth may be also seen at the\r\nNatural History Museum (pier case 31) in a tall glass jar. It came\r\nfrom frozen soil, Behring Strait. By the side of this will be seen, in\r\na glass box, a portion of the skin of a mammoth, from the banks of the\r\nriver Alaseja, Province of Yakutsk, Siberia. It exhibits the under\r\nfur, the long hair having entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n[63] Fig. 32 in Part I. of the _Guide to the Exhibition Galleries in\r\nthe Department of Geology and Palæontology in the British Museum\r\n(Natural History), Cromwell Road_. (Price 1_s._) This most useful\r\nguide should be consulted by the reader.\r\n\r\nAdams's specimen was, Dr. Woodward thinks, an old individual, and its\r\ntusks had curved upwards so much as to be of little use. In younger\r\nones they were less curved. The hair that still remains on the skin of\r\nthe St. Petersburg specimen is of the colour of the camel, very\r\nthick-set and curled in locks. Bristles of a dark colour are\r\ninterspersed, some reddish, and some nearly black. The colour of the\r\nskin is a dull black, as in living elephants (see restoration, Plate\r\nXX.).\r\n\r\nRemains of the Mammoth (Elephas primigenius) have been found in great\r\nnumbers in the British Isles. A list of localities (from Mr. Leith\r\nAdams's monograph on fossil elephants) is given in the Appendix, but\r\neven this might be extended. Mr. Samuel Woodward calculated that\r\nupward of two thousand grinders of elephants have been dredged up\r\nduring a period of thirteen years upon the oyster-bed off Hasborough,\r\non the Norfolk coast. But many of these doubtless belong to other\r\nspecies of older date, such as Elephas antiquus.\r\n\r\nDr. Bree, of Colchester, says that the sea-bottom off Dunkirk, whence\r\nhe has made a collection, is so full of mammalian remains that the\r\nsailors speak of it as \"the Burying-ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Mammoth occur over a very large geographical\r\narea--fully half the globe.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important discovery of a frozen Mammoth is that of a\r\nyoung Russian engineer, Benkendorf by name, who was an eye-witness of\r\nits resurrection, though, most unfortunately, he was unable either to\r\nprocure his specimen, as Mr. Adams did, or to make drawings of it.\r\nBeing employed by the Russian Government in making a survey of the\r\ncoast off the mouth of the Lena and Indigirka rivers, he was\r\ndespatched up the latter river in 1846, in command of a small\r\nsteam-cutter. The following is a translation of the account which he\r\nwrote to a friend in Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XX.\r\n\r\nTHE MAMMOTH, ELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS.\r\n\r\nAn inhabitant of Northern regions during the Great Ice Age.]\r\n\r\n\"In 1846 there was unusually warm weather in the north of Siberia.\r\nAlready in May unusual rains poured over the moors and bogs, storms\r\nshook the earth, and the streams carried not only ice to the sea, but\r\nalso large tracts of land, thawed by the masses of warm water fed by\r\nthe southern rains.... We steamed on the first favourable day up the\r\nIndigirka; but there were no thoughts of land; we saw around us only a\r\nsea of dirty brown water, and knew the river only by the rushing and\r\nroaring of the stream. The river rolled against us trees, moss, and\r\nlarge masses of peat, so that it was only with great trouble and\r\ndanger that we could proceed. At the end of the second day, we were\r\nonly about forty versts up the stream; some one had to stand with the\r\nsounding-rod in hand continually, and the boat received so many shocks\r\nthat it shuddered to the keel. A wooden vessel would have been\r\nsmashed. Around us we saw nothing but the flooded land for eight days.\r\nWe met with the like hindrances until at last we reached the place\r\nwhere our Jakuti were to have met us. Further up was a place called\r\nUjandina, whence the people were to have come to us; but they were not\r\nthere, prevented evidently by the floods.\r\n\r\n\"As we had been there in former years, we knew the place. But how it\r\nhad changed! The Indigirka, here about three versts wide, had torn up\r\nthe land and worn itself a fresh channel; and when the waters sank we\r\nsaw, to our astonishment, that the old river-bed had become merely\r\nthat of an insignificant stream. This allowed me to cut through the\r\nsoft earth, and we went reconnoitring up the new stream, which had\r\nworn its way westwards. Afterwards we landed on the new shore, and\r\nsurveyed the undermining and destructive operation of the wild waters,\r\nthat carried away, with extraordinary rapidity, masses of soft peat\r\nand loam. It was then that we made a wonderful discovery. The land on\r\nwhich we were treading was moorland, covered thickly with young\r\nplants. Many lovely flowers rejoiced the eye in the warm beams of the\r\nsun, that shone for twenty-two out of the twenty-four hours. The\r\nstream rolled over and tore up the soft wet ground like chaff, so that\r\nit was dangerous to go near the brink. While we were all quiet, we\r\nsuddenly heard under our feet a sudden gurgling and stirring, which\r\nbetrayed the working of the disturbed waters. Suddenly our jäger, ever\r\non the outlook, called loudly, and pointed to a singular and unshapely\r\nobject, which rose and sank through the disturbed waters. I had\r\nalready remarked it, but not given it any attention, considering it\r\nonly drift-wood. Now we all hastened to the spot on the shore, had the\r\nboat drawn near, and waited until the mysterious thing should again\r\nshow itself. Our patience was tried, but at last a black, horrible,\r\ngiant-like mass was thrust out of the water, and we beheld a colossal\r\nelephant's head, armed with mighty tusks, with its long trunk moving\r\nin the water in an unearthly manner, as though seeking for something\r\nlost therein. Breathless with astonishment, I beheld the monster\r\nhardly twelve feet from me, with his half-open eyes yet showing the\r\nwhites. It was still in good preservation.\r\n\r\n\"'A mammoth! a mammoth!' broke out the Tschernomori; and I shouted,\r\n'Here, quickly. Chains and ropes!' I will go over our preparations for\r\nsecuring the giant animal, whose body the water was trying to tear\r\nfrom us. As the animal again sank, we waited for an opportunity to\r\nthrow the ropes over his neck. This was only accomplished after many\r\nefforts. For the rest we had no cause for anxiety, for after examining\r\nthe ground I satisfied myself that the hind legs of the Mammoth still\r\nstuck in the earth, and that the waters would work for us to unloosen\r\nthem. We therefore fastened a rope round his neck, threw a chain round\r\nhis tusks, that were eight feet long, drove a stake into the ground\r\nabout twenty feet from the shore, and made chain and rope fast to it.\r\nThe day went by quicker than I thought for, but still the time seemed\r\nlong before the animal was secured, as it was only after the lapse of\r\ntwenty-four hours that the waters had loosened it. But the position of\r\nthe animal was interesting to me; it was standing in the earth, and\r\nnot lying on its side or back as a dead animal naturally would,\r\nindicating by this the manner of its destruction. The soft peat or\r\nmarsh land, on which he stepped thousands of years ago, gave way under\r\nthe weight of the giant, and he sank as he stood on it, feet foremost,\r\nincapable of saving himself; and a severe frost came and turned him\r\ninto ice, and the moor which had buried him. The latter, however, grew\r\nand flourished, every summer renewing itself. Possibly the\r\nneighbouring stream had heaped over the dead body plants and sand. God\r\nonly knows what causes had worked for its preservation; now, however,\r\nthe stream had brought it once more to light of day, and I, an\r\nephemera of life compared with this primæval giant, was sent by Heaven\r\njust at the right time to welcome him. You can imagine how I jumped\r\nfor joy.\r\n\r\n\"During our evening meal, our posts announced strangers--a troop of\r\nJakuti came on their fast, shaggy horses. They were our appointed\r\npeople, and were very joyful at the sight of us. Our company was\r\naugmented by them to about fifty persons. On showing them our\r\nwonderful capture, they hastened to the stream, and it was amusing to\r\nhear how they chattered and talked over the sight. The first day I\r\nleft them in quiet possession, but when, on the following, the ropes\r\nand chains gave a great jerk, a sign that the Mammoth was quite freed\r\nfrom the earth, I commanded them to use their utmost strength and\r\nbring the beast to land. At length, after much hard work, in which the\r\nhorses were extremely useful, the animal was brought to land, and we\r\nwere able to roll the body about twelve feet from the shore. The\r\ndecomposing effect of the warm air filled us all with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Picture to yourself an elephant with a body covered with thick fur,\r\nabout thirteen feet in height, and fifteen in length, with tusks eight\r\nfeet long, thick, and curving outward at their ends,[64] a stout trunk\r\nof six feet in length, colossal limbs of one and a half feet in\r\nthickness, and a tail, naked up to the end, which was covered with\r\nthick tufty hair. The animal was fat and well-grown; death had\r\novertaken him in the fulness of his powers. His parchment-like, large,\r\nnaked ears, lay fearfully turned over the head; about the shoulders\r\nand the back he had stiff hair, about a foot in length, like a mane.\r\nThe long outer hair was deep brown and coarsely rooted. The top of the\r\nhead looked so wild, and so penetrated with pich[65] that it resembled\r\nthe rind of an old oak tree. On the sides it was cleaner, and under\r\nthe outer hair there appeared everywhere a wool, very soft, warm and\r\nthick, and of a fallow-brown colour. The giant was well protected\r\nagainst the cold. The whole appearance of the animal was fearfully\r\nstrange and wild. It had not the shape of our present elephants. As\r\ncompared with our Indian elephants, its head was rough, the brain-case\r\nlow and narrow, but the trunk and mouth were much larger. The teeth\r\nwere very powerful. Our elephant is an awkward animal, but compared\r\nwith this Mammoth it is as an Arabian steed to a coarse, ugly\r\ndray-horse. I could not divest myself of a feeling of fear as I\r\napproached the head; the broken, widely-open eyes, gave the animal an\r\nappearance of life, as though it might move in a moment and destroy us\r\nwith a roar.... The bad smell of the body warned us that it was time\r\nto save of it what we could, and the swelling flood, too, bid us\r\nhasten. First of all we cut off the tusks, and sent them to the\r\ncutter. Then the people tried to hew off the head, but notwithstanding\r\ntheir good will, this work was slow. As the belly of the animal was\r\ncut open the intestines rolled out, and then the smell was so dreadful\r\nthat I could not overcome my nauseousness, and was obliged to turn\r\naway. But I had the stomach separated, and brought on one side. It was\r\nwell filled, and the contents instructive and well preserved. The\r\nprincipal were young shoots of the fir and pine; a quantity of young\r\nfir-cones, also in a chewed state, were mixed with the mass.... As we\r\nwere eviscerating the animal, I was as careless and forgetful as my\r\nJakuti, who did not notice that the ground was sinking under their\r\nfeet, until a fearful scream warned me of their misfortune, as I was\r\nstill groping in the animal's stomach. Shocked, I sprang up, and\r\nbeheld how the river was burying in its waves our five Jakuti and our\r\nlaboriously saved beast. Fortunately, the boat was near, so that our\r\npoor workpeople were all saved, but the Mammoth was swallowed up by\r\nthe waves, and never more made its appearance.\"\r\n\r\n[64] This must be incorrect (see p. 203).\r\n\r\n[65] \"Und mit Pech so durchgedrungen.\"\r\n\r\nMuch may be learned from this highly interesting account; it contains\r\nthe key to several questions which otherwise might have remained\r\nunsolved. Let us see what conclusions can be derived therefrom.\r\n_First_, its position and perfect state of preservation are sufficient\r\nto prove that it was buried where it died. It sank in a marsh,\r\nprobably during the summer. Then came the cold of winter; the carcase,\r\ntogether with the ground around it, was frozen so that decomposition\r\nwas arrested, and frozen it must have remained for many centuries till\r\nthe day when M. Benkendorf came across it. Or it may have been buried\r\nup in a snow-drift which in time became ice.\r\n\r\nIn the region where frozen Mammoths occur (and there are at least nine\r\ncases on record), a considerable thickness of frozen soil may be found\r\nat all seasons of the year; so that if a carcase be once embedded in\r\nmud or ice, its putrefaction may be arrested for indefinite ages.\r\nAccording to one authority, the ground is now permanently frozen even\r\nto the depth of four hundred feet at the town of Jakutsh, on the\r\nwestern bank of the river Lena. Throughout a large part of Siberia the\r\nboundary cliffs of the lakes and rivers consist of earthy materials\r\nand ice in horizontal layers. Middendorf bored to the depth of seventy\r\nfeet, and after passing through much frozen soil mixed with ice, came\r\ndown upon a solid mass of pure transparent ice, the depth of which he\r\nwas unable to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe year 1846, when M. Benkendorf saw his Mammoth, was exceptional on\r\naccount of its unusually warm summer, so that the ground of the tundra\r\nregion thawed, and was converted into a morass. Had any Mammoths been\r\nalive then, and strayed beyond the limits of the woods into the\r\ntundra, probably some of them would have been likewise engulphed, and,\r\nwhen once covered up and protected from the decaying action of the\r\nair, the cold of the next winter would have frozen their carcases as\r\nthis one must have been frozen up.\r\n\r\nTruly, \"there is nothing new under the sun,\" and the present highly\r\nuseful method of freezing meat and bringing it over from America or\r\nNew Zealand to add to our insufficient home supplies, is but a resort\r\nto a process employed by Nature long before the age of steamships, and\r\nperhaps even before the appearance of man on the earth!\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, with regard to the food of the Mammoth, Benkendorf's\r\ndiscovery is of great service in solving the question how such a\r\ncreature could have maintained its existence in so inhospitable and\r\nunpromising a country. The presence of fir-spikes in the stomach is\r\nsufficient to prove that it fed on vegetation such as is now found at\r\nthe northern part of the woods as they join the low treeless tundra in\r\nwhich the body lay buried.\r\n\r\nBefore this discovery the food of the Mammoth was unknown, and all\r\nsorts of theories were devised in order to account for its remains\r\nbeing found so far north. Some thought that the Mammoth lived in\r\ntemperate regions, and that the carcases were swept down by great\r\nfloods into higher and colder latitudes. But it would be impossible\r\nfor the bodies to be hurried along a devious course for so many miles\r\nwithout a good deal of injury, and probably they would fall to pieces\r\non the way. But, as Professor Owen has so convincingly argued, there\r\nis no reason why herds of Mammoths should not have obtained a\r\nsufficient supply of food in a country like the southern part of\r\nSiberia, where trees abound in spite of the fact that during a great\r\npart of the year it is covered with snow. And this is his line of\r\nreasoning. The molar teeth of the elephant show a highly complicated\r\nand peculiar structure, and there are no other quadrupeds that feed to\r\nsuch an extent on the woody fibre of the branches of trees. Many\r\nmammals, as we know, eat the leaves of trees; some gnaw the bark; but\r\nelephants alone tear down and crunch the branches. One would think\r\nthere was but little nourishment to be got from such. But the hard\r\nvertical plates of their huge grinders enable them to pound up the\r\ntough vegetable tissue and render it more or less palatable. Of\r\ncourse, the foliage is the most tempting, but where foliage is scarce\r\nsomething more is required.\r\n\r\nNow, in the teeth of the Mammoth the same principle of construction is\r\nobserved, only with greater complexity, for there are more of these\r\ngrinding plates and a larger proportion of dense enamel. Hence the\r\ninference seems unmistakable that the extinct species fed more largely\r\non woody fibre than does the elephant of to-day. Forests of hardy\r\ntrees and shrubs still grow upon the frozen soil of Siberia, and skirt\r\nthe banks of the Lena as far north as the sixtieth parallel of\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nIf the Mammoth flourished in temperate latitudes only, as formerly\r\nsuggested, then its thick shaggy coat becomes superfluous and\r\nmeaningless; but if it lived in the region where its body has been\r\nfound, then the argument from its teeth, and the fir-spikes found in\r\nits stomach, is confirmed by the nature of its skin, and all the old\r\ndifficulties vanish. Professor Owen considers that we may safely infer\r\nthat, if living at the present day, it would find a sufficient supply\r\nof food at all seasons of the year in the sixtieth parallel, and even\r\nhigher. Perhaps they migrated north during the summer; and, judging\r\nfrom the present limits of arboreal vegetation, they may have been\r\nable to subsist even in latitude 70° north, for at the extreme points\r\nof Lapland pines attain a height of sixty feet.[66]\r\n\r\n[66] Sir Henry Howorth, in his _Mammoth and the Flood_, suggests\r\nanother theory, and gives some valuable information.\r\n\r\nIt is often no easy matter to form conclusions with regard to the\r\nhabits of extinct animals; and too much reliance must not be placed on\r\narguments derived from the habits of their living descendants or their\r\nnear relations. The older geologists fell into this mistake with\r\nregard to the Mammoth, as did even Cuvier. Modern elephants are at\r\npresent restricted to regions where trees flourish with perennial\r\nfoliage, and, therefore, it was argued that there must have been a\r\nchange of climate--either gradual or sudden, in the country of the\r\nMammoth.\r\n\r\nCuvier, who believed in sudden revolutions on the earth's surface,\r\nargued that the Mammoth could not possibly have lived in Siberia as it\r\nis now; and that, at the very moment when the beast was destroyed, the\r\nland was suddenly converted into a glacial region! (\"C'est donc le\r\nmême instant qui a fait périr les animaux, et qui a rendu glacial le\r\npays qu'ils habitaient, cet événement a été subit, instantané, sans\r\naucune gradation.\"[67]) Sir Charles Lyell argued, from geological\r\nevidence with regard to the rise of land along the Siberian coast,\r\nthat the climate had become somewhat more severe, and that finally the\r\nMammoth, though protected by its shaggy coat, died out on account of\r\nscarcity of food.[68]\r\n\r\n[67] _Ossemens Fossiles_, tom. i. p. 108.\r\n\r\n[68] See _The Principles of Geology_, vol. i. chap. x.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen is unwilling to believe that such changes as these\r\nbrought about the final extinction of the Mammoth, and he concludes\r\nthat it was quite possible for such an animal to have flourished as\r\nnear to the North Pole as is compatible with the growth of hardy trees\r\nor shrubs.\r\n\r\n\"The fact seems to have been generally overlooked, that an animal\r\norganised to gain its subsistence from the branches or woody fibre of\r\ntrees, is thereby rendered independent of the seasons which regulate\r\nthe development of leaves and fruit; the forest food of such a species\r\nbecomes as perennial as the lichens that flourish beneath the winter\r\nsnows of Lapland; and, were such a quadruped to be clothed, like the\r\nreindeer, with a natural garment capable of resisting the rigours of\r\nan arctic winter, its adaptation for such a climate would be\r\ncomplete.... The wonderful and unlooked-for discovery of an entire\r\nMammoth, demonstrating the arctic character of its natural clothing,\r\nhas, however, confirmed the deductions which might have been\r\nlegitimately founded upon the localities of its most abundant remains,\r\nas well as upon the structure of its teeth, viz. that, like the\r\nReindeer and Musk Ox of the present day, it was capable of existing in\r\nhigh northern latitudes.\"[69]\r\n\r\n[69] _A History of British Fossil Mammals and Birds_, by Richard Owen,\r\nF.R.S., etc. London, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the extinction of the Mammoth is not an easy one to\r\nsolve. We can hardly account for its disappearance by calling in\r\ngeographical changes by which its range became restricted, and its\r\nfood supply diminished, so that in the competition with other\r\nherbivorous animals this primæval giant \"went to the wall,\" as the\r\nsaying is. Nor does Lyell's appeal to a change in climate, by which\r\nthe cold of Siberia became too intense even for the Mammoth, seem\r\nquite satisfactory, especially when we remember how very far north fir\r\ntrees range (p. 211).\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth, probably, was endowed with a fairly tough constitution.\r\nIn Siberia it fed on fir trees. In Kentucky it fared better, and was\r\nsurrounded by such vegetation as now flourishes in that temperate\r\nregion. In the valley of the Tiber (where also its remains are found),\r\nthough during the \"Glacial period\" the temperature was, doubtless,\r\nlower than at present, we cannot imagine that an arctic climate\r\nprevailed. Thus we see that it was capable of flourishing in various\r\nand widely separated regions where the conditions of climate and food\r\nsupply could hardly have been similar.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boyd Dawkins, whose views we are adopting here,[70] considers\r\nthat the Mammoth was exterminated by man--a simple solution of the\r\nquestion, which seems to present no difficulties. That it was hunted\r\nby the primitive folk of the \"Reindeer period\" in France, is proved by\r\nits remains in the caves where men dwelt, and by a drawing cut by a\r\nhunter of the older Stone Age on one of its own tusks! A cast of this\r\nmost interesting relic may be seen in the prehistoric collection at\r\nthe British Museum, and shows that the men of that time were not\r\ndevoid of artistic power (see Fig. 53). Some of the lines in this\r\nillustration represent cracks in the original, so that the actual\r\noutline is not easily made out. But here we see the head particularly\r\nwell drawn, the tusks and downward lines indicating the hairy mane.\r\nReindeer and other animals were also engraved on horn, etc., by the\r\nmen who were contemporary with the Mammoth.\r\n\r\n[70] _Popular Science Review_, vol. vii. p. 275 (1868).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Figure of the Mammoth, engraved on Mammoth\r\nivory by cavemen, La Madelaine, France. In the Lartet Collection,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\nWe know that man has exterminated a great many noble animals in his\r\ntime, and, alas! continues to do so at the present time in Africa, and\r\nin North and South America. The giraffe and the bison, once so\r\nplentiful, are now almost extinct. Primitive man was a hunter, and, as\r\nhe multiplied, his wants became greater, and more animals were\r\ntherefore destroyed. Probably the same explanation applies to the\r\ngreat Moa bird of New Zealand, and possibly even to the Megatherium of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the tusks of the Mammoth, which are considerably larger\r\nthan those of either the African or Indian elephant, it is evident\r\nthat they must have been of some service, for Nature would never have\r\nendowed the animal with such great and ponderous instruments--to\r\nsupport which the skull is greatly modified in both the Mammoth and\r\nelephant--without some definite purpose. We have often been asked how\r\nthe Mammoth used his tusks; now, this question can best be answered by\r\nreference to the habits of living elephants. The elephant of to-day is\r\na fairly peaceable creature, but, if attacked, can despatch the\r\naggressor in various ways. Some enemies he can crush under his feet; a\r\nman he can pick up with his trunk and hurl to a considerable distance,\r\nprobably with fatal results. But the tusks do not appear to be used as\r\nweapons of offence or defence. We must consider how the animal feeds.\r\nThe general food of the elephant consists of the foliage of trees. In\r\nAfrica it feeds largely on mimosas. Now, it is clear that, in spite of\r\nhaving a long trunk, an elephant cannot obtain all the leaves of a\r\ntall tree while the tree remains standing; mimosa trees, for instance,\r\nare often thirty feet high, and have richer foliage at the crown. So\r\nit appears that they actually overturn them. On this point we have the\r\ntestimony of Sir Samuel Baker, who says, \"The destruction caused by a\r\nherd of elephants in a mimosa forest is extraordinary, and I have seen\r\ntrees uprooted of so large a size that I am convinced no single\r\nelephant could have overturned them. I have measured trees four feet\r\nsix inches in circumference, and about thirty feet high, uprooted by\r\nelephants. The natives assured me that the elephants mutually assist\r\neach other, and that several engage together in the work of\r\noverturning a large tree. None of the mimosas have tap-roots; thus the\r\npowerful tusks of the elephants applied as crowbars at the roots,\r\nwhile others pull at the branches with their trunks, will effect the\r\ndestruction of a tree so large as to appear invulnerable.\" Another\r\nwriter says the elephant also feeds on a variety of bulbs, the\r\nsituation of which is indicated by his exquisite sense of smell, and\r\nthat, to obtain these, he turns up the ground with his tusks, so that\r\nwhole acres may be seen thus ploughed up.\r\n\r\nNow, in Siberia, where the ground would be harder, we can imagine that\r\nthe larger tusks of the Mammoth would be highly serviceable in\r\nuprooting fir trees and breaking off their branches, for Benkendorf's\r\nfortunate discovery informs us that such trees formed at least part of\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MASTODON AND THE WOOLLY RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\n    \"Of one departed world\r\n    I see the mighty show.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother elephantine monster, evidently allied to the Mammoth, was the\r\nMastodon, a creature which there is reason to think was contemporary,\r\nin America, with the men of prehistoric age. It was so named by Baron\r\nCuvier to distinguish it from the Mammoth, with which it was by others\r\nconsidered identical; and his discrimination of the two forms marked\r\nan important and early step in the history of palæontology. The chief\r\ndifference between these two extinct types lies in their molar teeth.\r\nThese, on cutting the gum, must have exhibited a number of somewhat\r\nconical protuberances of a mammiform appearance; hence the name.[71] As\r\nthese points were worn down by mastication, the surface of the tooth\r\nshowed a series of discs of various sizes. The teeth were covered by a\r\nvery thick coat of dense, brittle enamel. There are, however,\r\ndifferences in the bony framework of the animal, as well as in its\r\ngeneral proportions, which serve to distinguish it from the Mammoth;\r\nbut it will not be necessary to enter into these matters here, for\r\nthis is difficult ground, even to the student who is well versed in\r\nanatomy. Notwithstanding a vast amount of observation on the subject,\r\nconsiderable differences of opinion have prevailed among\r\npalæontologists with regard to the proper relation of the Mastodon to\r\nthe Mammoth and living elephants.\r\n\r\n[71] Greek--_mastos_, teat; _odous_, _odontos_, tooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Skeleton _Mastodon arvernensis_, Pliocene,\r\nEurope.]\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the Geological Gallery in the Natural History\r\nMuseum, South Kensington, the reader will see a magnificent skeleton\r\nof an American Mastodon, of which more presently. On this specimen our\r\nartist has based his restoration, Plate XXI. A large part of the great\r\ngallery referred to is devoted to the fossil remains of proboscideans;\r\nthat is, creatures provided with a long proboscis, or trunk, such as\r\nelephants and Mastodons. This collection, from widely different\r\nquarters, is the largest and most complete in the world. By comparing\r\nthe specimens of teeth in the cases, and looking at the fine specimens\r\nof skulls, and the numerous bones and tusks in the side cases, the\r\nreader will carry away a better idea than we can convey by\r\ndescription. Fig. 54 shows the skeleton of Mastodon arvernensis with\r\ntwo very long tusks. Mastodon augustidens had four tusks, two in each\r\njaw, but one of those in the lower jaw sometimes dropped out as the\r\nanimal grew older.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MASTODON OF OHIO, M. AMERICANUS.]\r\n\r\nNo genus of quadrupeds has been more extensively diffused over the\r\nglobe than the Mastodon. From the tropics it has extended both north\r\nand south into temperate regions, and in America its remains have been\r\ndiscovered as high as latitude 66° N. But the true home of the\r\nMastodon giganteus, in the United States, like that of M. augustidens\r\nin Europe, lies in a more temperate zone, and, as Professor Owen says,\r\nwe have no evidence that any species was specially adapted, like the\r\nMammoth, for braving the rigours of an arctic winter.\r\n\r\nNow, we know from trustworthy geological evidence that the Mastodon is\r\na much older form of life than the Mammoth. The record of the rocks\r\ntells us that it first put in an appearance in an early Tertiary\r\nperiod known as the Miocene (see Table of Strata, Appendix I.), and in\r\nthe Old World lived on to the end of the succeeding Pliocene period.\r\nBut in America several species, especially M. giganteus, survived till\r\nlate in the Pleistocene period, where it was probably seen by\r\nprimitive men. This is all that is known about its geographical range,\r\nand its antiquity or range in time; some day, perhaps before very\r\nlong, palæontologists may be able to trace the great proboscideans\r\nfurther back in time, and to show from what form of animal they were\r\nderived. Strange as it may seem, anatomists declare that they show\r\nsome remote affinity with the rodents, or gnawing animals, and, in\r\nsome respects, even with Sirenians, such as the Manatee (see Chapter\r\nXVI.). But at present the evolution of this remarkable group of\r\nanimals is an unsolved problem. Those strange animals, the Dinocerata,\r\nfrom Wyoming, described in Chapter X., may perhaps give some\r\nindication as to the direction in which we must look for the\r\nelephant's ancestors. We noticed that their limbs were decidedly\r\nelephantine (see p. 150), but they had no trunks, and their skulls\r\nshowed curious prominences like horn-cores; their teeth too are very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to the Geological Collection at South Kensington will also\r\nnotice a splendid cranium of an elephant, with very long tusks, from\r\nthe famous Sivalik Hills of Northern India[72] (Stand D on plan). It\r\nbelonged to Elephas ganesa, one of the largest of all the fossil\r\nelephants known. The total length of the cranium and tusks is fourteen\r\nfeet, and the tusks alone measure ten feet six inches in length! This\r\nremarkable specimen was presented by Sir William Erskine Baker, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n[72] There is some difficulty in determining the precise geological\r\nage of the strata in question, on account of the curious mixture of\r\nfossil forms of life they contain; but many authorities consider them\r\nto be of older Pliocene age.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Mastodon. It was early in the eighteenth century\r\nthat the teeth and bones of the Mastodon were first described,[73] and\r\nit is curious to observe how differently scientific discoveries were\r\nregarded in those days; for this society of learned men published in\r\nthese _Transactions_ a letter from Dr. Mather to Dr. Woodward, in\r\nwhich the former gives an account of a large work in manuscript, but\r\ndoes not name the author. This book, which appears to have been a\r\ncommentary on the Bible, Dr. Mather recommends \"to the patronage of\r\nsome generous Moecenas to promote the publication of it,\" and\r\ntranscribes, as a specimen, a passage announcing the discovery at\r\nAlbany, now the capital of New York State, in the year 1705, of\r\nenormous bones and teeth. These relics he considered to belong to a\r\nformer race of giants, and appeals to them in confirmation of Genesis\r\nvi. 4 (\"The Nephilim (giants) were in the earth in those days\").\r\n\r\n[73] _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society_, 1714, vol.\r\nxxix.\r\n\r\nPortions of the skeleton of Mastodon, discovered in 1801, were sent to\r\nEngland and France, and two complete specimens were at length put\r\ntogether in America. One of these was exhibited as a Mammoth, in\r\nBristol and London, by Mr. C. W. Peale, a naturalist, by whom they\r\nwere found in marly clay on the banks of the Hudson, near Newburgh, in\r\nthe State of New York.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, in 1739, a French officer, M. de Longueil, traversed\r\nthe virgin forests bordering on the river Ohio, in order to reach the\r\nMississippi, and the Indians who escorted him accidentally discovered,\r\non the borders of a marsh, various bones, some of which seemed to be\r\nthose of unknown animals. In this turfy marsh, known as the Big Bone\r\nLick, or Salt Lick, in consequence of the saltness of its waters,\r\nherds of wild animals collect together, attracted by the salt, for\r\nwhich they have a great liking. This is probably the reason why so\r\nmany bones have accumulated here. M. de Longueil carried away some\r\nbones and teeth, and, on his return to France, presented them to\r\nDaubenton and Buffon. The former declared the teeth to be those of a\r\nhippopotamus, and the tusk and gigantic thigh-bone he reported to\r\nbelong to an elephant. Buffon, however, did not share this opinion,\r\nand succeeded in converting Daubenton, as well as other French\r\nnaturalists, to his views. He gave to this fossil animal the name of\r\n\"the Elephant of Ohio,\" but formed an exaggerated idea of its size.\r\n\r\nThis discovery produced a great impression in Europe. The English,\r\nbecoming masters of Canada by the peace of 1763, sought eagerly for\r\nmore remains. Croghan, the geographer, visited the Big Bone Lick, and\r\nfound there some more bones of the same kind. He forwarded many cases\r\nto different naturalists in London.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Howorth, in his recent work, _The Mammoth and the Flood_ (in\r\nwhich are brought forward certain views not shared by most\r\ngeologists), mentions that in 1762 the Shawnee Indians found, some\r\nthree miles from the river Ohio, the skeletons of five Mastodons, and\r\nreported that one of the heads had a long nose attached to it, below\r\nwhich was the mouth. Several explorers report discoveries of a like\r\nnature, which, if they may be trusted, and if they really refer to the\r\nMastodon, and not the Mammoth, seem to show that portions of the skin\r\nand hairy covering have been seen. If so, their preservation is\r\nprobably due to the saltness of the waters of this marsh, for salt is\r\na good preservative. In _The American Journal of Science_,[74] Dr. Koch\r\nreports the discovery of a Mastodon's skeleton, of which the head and\r\nfore foot were well preserved, also large pieces of the skin, which\r\nlooked like freshly tanned leather. But some of these accounts refer\r\nto tufts of hair--in one case three inches long.\r\n\r\n[74] Vol. xxxvi. p. 199.\r\n\r\nThe great skeleton of Mastodon americanus already referred to was\r\npurchased by the trustees of the British Museum, of Mr. Albert Koch, a\r\nwell-known collector of fossil remains, who had exhibited it in the\r\nEgyptian Hall, Piccadilly, in 1842 and 1843, under the name of \"the\r\nMissouri Leviathan,\" an enormous and ill-constructed monster, made up\r\nof the bones of this skeleton, together with many belonging to other\r\nindividuals, in such a way as to horrify an anatomist and appeal all\r\nthe more forcibly to the imagination of the public. From this\r\nheterogeneous assemblage of bones those belonging to the same animal\r\nhave now been selected and articulated in their proper places. The\r\nheight of this specimen is nine feet and a half, and the total length\r\nabout eighteen feet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Koch, the remains exhibited by him were found in\r\nalluvial deposits on the banks of a small tributary of the Osage\r\nRiver, in Benton County, Missouri. The bones were embedded in a brown,\r\nsandy deposit, full of vegetable matter, in which were recognised\r\nremains of the cypress, tropical cane, swamp moss, etc., and this was\r\ncovered by blue clay and gravel to a thickness of about fifteen feet.\r\nMr. Koch personally assured Dr. Mantell that an Indian flint\r\narrow-head was found beneath the leg-bones of this skeleton, and that\r\nfour similar weapons were embedded in the same stratum. He declared\r\nthat he took them out of the bed with his own hands.\r\n\r\nIn the Pier-case (No. 38), near the Mastodon americanus, may be seen\r\nfifteen heads and jaws, together with other parts of the skeleton,\r\nmostly obtained from the same locality, but some of them came from the\r\n\"Big Bone Lick,\" Kentucky.\r\n\r\nA fine specimen, obtained from a marsh near Newburgh, by Dr. Warren,\r\nmeasured eleven feet in height, and seventeen in length, while the\r\ntusks were nearly ten feet long, not including the portion in the long\r\nsockets of the cranium. Twenty-six species of Mastodon are known.\r\n\r\nAn interesting find was that of Dr. Barton, a professor of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. At a depth of six feet, and under a great\r\nbank of chalk, bones of the Mastodon were found sufficient to form a\r\nskeleton, and in the middle of the bones was seen a mass of vegetable\r\nmatter enveloped in a kind of sac (which probably was the stomach of\r\nthe animal). This matter was found to be composed of small leaves and\r\nbranches, amongst which was recognised a species of rush yet common in\r\nVirginia. In North America, where the Mastodon survived into the\r\nperiod of primitive man, various strange legends exist that seem to\r\nrefer to it. Traditions were rife among the Red Men concerning this\r\ngiant form and its destruction.\r\n\r\nA French officer named Fabri informed M. Buffon, the naturalist, that\r\nthe \"savages\" (Indians) regarded the bones found in various parts of\r\nCanada and Louisiana as belonging to an animal which they named\r\n\"Father of the Ox.\" The Shawnee Indians believed that with this\r\nenormous animal there existed men of proportionate development, and\r\nthat the Great Being destroyed both with thunderbolts. Those of\r\nVirginia state that as a troop of these terrible animals were\r\ndestroying the deer, bisons, and other animals created for the use of\r\nIndians, the Great Man slew them all with his thunder, except the Big\r\nBull, who shook off the thunderbolts as they fell on him, till at\r\nlast, being wounded in the side, he fled towards the great lakes,\r\nwhere he lies to this day.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the songs which Fabri heard in Canada: \"When the great\r\n_Manitou_ descended to the earth, in order to satisfy himself that the\r\ncreatures he had created were happy, and he interrogated all the\r\nanimals, the bison replied that he would be quite contented with his\r\nfate in the grassy meadows, where the grass reached his belly, if he\r\nwere not also compelled to keep his eyes constantly turned towards the\r\nmountains to catch the first sight of the 'Father of the Ox,' as he\r\ndescended, with fury, to devour him and his companions.\" Many other\r\ntribes repeat similar legends.\r\n\r\nThe bones with which Mazuyer practised his famous deception were those\r\nof a Mastodon (see p. 196).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Head of Woolly Rhinoceros, partly restored by\r\nM. Deslongchamps.]\r\n\r\nContemporary with the Mammoth in Siberia and in Northern and Western\r\nEurope, was the \"Woolly Rhinoceros\" (Rhinoceros tichorhinus). Its body\r\nhas been found in frozen soil in Siberia, with the skin, the two\r\nhorns, the hair, and even the flesh preserved, as in the case of the\r\nMammoth. It had a smooth skin without folds, covered with a fine curly\r\nand coarse hairy coat, to enable it to withstand the rigours of an\r\narctic climate. The traveller Pallas gives a long account of one of\r\nthese creatures, which was taken out of the ice, with its skin, hair,\r\nand flesh preserved. The following is a brief summary of his\r\nnarrative. The body was observed in December, 1771, by some Jakuts\r\nnear the river Vilui, which discharges itself into the Lena below\r\nJakutsk in Siberia, latitude 64° north. It lay in frozen sand upon the\r\nbanks of the river. A certain Russian inspector had sent on to\r\nIrkutsk the head and two feet of the animal, all well preserved. The\r\nrest of it was too much decomposed, and so was left. The head was\r\nquite recognisable, since it was covered with its leathery skin. The\r\neyelids had escaped total decay (see Fig. 55). The skin and tendons of\r\nthe head and feet still preserved considerable flexibility. He was,\r\nhowever, compelled to cross the Baikal lake before the ice broke up,\r\nand so could neither draw up a sufficiently careful description nor\r\nmake sketches of those parts which were sufficiently preserved. Plate\r\nXXII. is a restoration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE WOOLLY RHINOCEROS, RHINOCEROS TICHORHINUS.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the Mammoth.]\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros in question was neither large for its species nor\r\nadvanced in age; but it was at least fully grown. The horns were gone,\r\nbut had left evident traces on the head. The skin which covered the\r\norbits of the eyes and formed the eyelids was so well preserved, that\r\nthe openings of the eyelids could be seen, though deformed and\r\nscarcely penetrable to the finger. The foot that was left--after some\r\nparts had unfortunately been burned while left to dry slowly on the\r\ntop of a furnace--was furnished with hairs. These hairs adhering in\r\nmany places to the skin, were from one to three lines in length,\r\ntolerably stiff and ash-coloured. What remained proved that the foot\r\nwas covered with bunches of hair hanging down.\r\n\r\nLike the Mammoth and the Mastodon, its contemporaries, the Woolly\r\nRhinoceros has given rise to some curious legends. In the city of\r\nKlagenfurt, in Carinthia, is a fountain on which is sculptured the\r\nhead of a monstrous dragon with six feet, and a head surmounted by a\r\nstout horn. According to popular tradition, still prevalent at\r\nKlagenfurt, this dragon lived in a cave, whence it issued from time to\r\ntime to frighten and ravage the country. A bold cavalier killed the\r\ndragon, paying with his life for this proof of courage. The same kind\r\nof legend seems to be current in every country, such as that of the\r\nvaliant St. George and the dragon, and of St. Martha, who about the\r\nsame time conquered the famous _Tarasque_ of the city of Languedoc,\r\nwhich bears the name of Tarascon.\r\n\r\nBut at Klagenfurt the popular legend has happily found a mouthpiece;\r\nthe head of the pretended dragon killed by the valorous knight is\r\npreserved in the Hôtel de Ville, and this head has furnished the\r\nsculptor of the fountain with a model for the head of his statue. Herr\r\nUnger, of Vienna, recognised at a glance the cranium of the fossil\r\nrhinoceros; its discovery in some cave had probably originated the\r\nfable of the knight and the dragon. It is always interesting to\r\ndiscover a scientific basis for fables which otherwise it would be\r\ndifficult to account for.\r\n\r\nThe same rhinoceros was once a denizen of our country, and its remains\r\nare met with in caves and river-gravels. Specimens of its skull have\r\nalso been dredged up by fishermen from the \"Dogger Bank\" in the North\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nGIANT BIRDS.\r\n\r\n     \"To discover order and intelligence in scenes of apparent\r\n     wildness and confusion is the pleasing task of the geological\r\n     inquirer.\"--Dr. Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the monsters that ever lived on the face of the earth, the\r\ngiant birds were perhaps the most grotesque. An emu or a cassowary of\r\nthe present day looks sufficiently strange by the side of ordinary\r\nbirds; but \"running birds\" much larger than these flourished not so\r\nvery long ago in New Zealand and Madagascar, and must at one time have\r\ninhabited areas now sunk below the ocean waves.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of these remarkable and truly gigantic\r\nbirds in New Zealand, and the famous researches of Professor Owen, by\r\nwhich their structures have been made known, must now engage our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839 Professor Owen exhibited, at a meeting of the\r\nZoological Society, part of a thigh-bone, or femur, 6 inches in\r\nlength, and 5-1/2 inches in its smallest circumference, with both\r\nextremities broken off. This bone of an unknown struthious bird was\r\nplaced in his hands for examination, by Mr. Rule, with the statement\r\nthat it was found in New Zealand, where the natives have a tradition\r\nthat it belonged to a bird now extinct, to which they give the name\r\nMoa. Similar bones, it was said, were found buried on the banks of the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nA minute description of this bone was given by the professor, who\r\npointed out the peculiar interest of this discovery on account of the\r\nremarkable character of the existing fauna of New Zealand, which still\r\nincludes one of the most extraordinary birds of the struthious order\r\n(\"running birds\"), viz. the Apteryx, and also because of the close\r\nanalogy which the event indicated by the present relic offers to the\r\nextinction of the Dodo in the island of Mauritius. On the strength of\r\nthis one fragment he ventured to assert that there once lived in New\r\nZealand a bird as large as the ostrich, and of the same order. This\r\nconclusion was more than confirmed by subsequent discoveries, which he\r\nanticipated; and, as we shall see, his estimate was a most moderate\r\none, for the extinct bird turned out to be considerably larger than\r\nthe ostrich.\r\n\r\nLater on he received from a friend in New Zealand news of the\r\ndiscovery of more bones. In 1843 a collection of bones of large birds\r\nwas sent to Dr. Buckland, Dean of Westminster, by the Rev. William\r\nWilliams, a zealous and successful Church missionary, long resident in\r\nNew Zealand. On sending off his consignment Mr. Williams wrote a\r\nletter, of which we give the greater part below.\r\n\r\n     /* \"Poverty Bay, New Zealand, February 28, 1842.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Sir, */\r\n\r\n     \"It is about three years ago, on paying a visit to this\r\n     coast--south of the East Cape, that the natives told me of\r\n     some extraordinary monster, which they said was in existence\r\n     in an inaccessible cavern on the side of a hill near the\r\n     river Wairoa; and they showed me at the same time some\r\n     fragments of bone taken out of the beds of rivers, which they\r\n     said belonged to this creature, to which they gave the name\r\n     Moa.\r\n\r\n     \"When I came to reside in this neighbourhood I heard the same\r\n     story a little enlarged; for it was said that this creature\r\n     _was still existing_ at the said hill, of which the name is\r\n     Wakapunake, and that it is guarded by a reptile of the lizard\r\n     species [genus]; but I could not learn that any of the\r\n     present generation had seen it. I still considered the whole\r\n     as an idle fable, but offered a large reward to any one who\r\n     would catch me either the bird or its protector....\"\r\n\r\n     These offers procured the collection of a considerable number\r\n     of fossil bones, on which Mr. Williams, in his letter, makes\r\n     the following observations:--\r\n\r\n     \"None of these bones have been found on the dry land, but are\r\n     all of them from the banks and beds of fresh-water rivers,\r\n     buried only a little distance in the mud.... All the streams\r\n     are in immediate connection with hills of some altitude.\r\n\r\n     \"2. This bird was in existence here at no very distant time,\r\n     though not in the memory of any of the inhabitants; for the\r\n     bones are found in the beds of the present streams, and do\r\n     not appear to have been brought into their present situation\r\n     by the action of any violent rush of waters.\r\n\r\n     \"3. They existed in considerable numbers\"--an observation\r\n     which has since been abundantly confirmed.\r\n\r\n     \"4. It may be inferred that this bird was long-lived, and\r\n     that it was many years before it attained its full size.\"\r\n     This is doubtful.\r\n\r\n     \"5. The greatest height of the bird was probably not less\r\n     than fourteen or sixteen feet.\" Fourteen is probably the\r\n     extreme limit.\r\n\r\n     \"Within the last few days I have obtained a piece of\r\n     information worthy of notice. Happening to speak to an\r\n     American about these bones, he told me that the bird is still\r\n     in existence in the neighbourhood of Cloudy Bay, in Cook's\r\n     Straits. He said that the natives there had mentioned to an\r\n     Englishman belonging to a whaling party that there was a bird\r\n     of extraordinary size to be seen only at night, on the side\r\n     of a hill near the place, and that he, with a native and a\r\n     second Englishman, went to the spot; that, after waiting some\r\n     time, they saw the creature at a little distance, which they\r\n     describe as being about fourteen or sixteen feet high. One of\r\n     the men proposed to go nearer and shoot, but his companion\r\n     was so exceedingly terrified, or perhaps both of them, that\r\n     they were satisfied with looking at the bird, when, after a\r\n     little time it took alarm, and strode off up the side of the\r\n     mountain.\r\n\r\n     \"This incident might not have been worth mentioning, had it\r\n     not been for the extraordinary agreement in point of size of\r\n     the bird\"--with his deductions from the bones. \"_Here_ are\r\n     the bones which will satisfy you that such a bird _has been_\r\n     in existence; and _there_ is said to be the _living bird_,\r\n     the supposed size of which, given by an independent witness,\r\n     precisely agrees.\" In spite, however, of several tales of\r\n     this kind, it is almost certain that these birds are now\r\n     quite extinct.\r\n\r\nThe leg-bones sent to London greatly exceeded in bulk those of the\r\nlargest horse. The leg-bone of a tall man is about 1 ft. 4 in. in\r\nlength, and the thigh of O'Brien, the Irish giant, whose skeleton,\r\neight feet high, is mounted in the Museum of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons, is not quite two feet. But some of the leg-bones (tibiæ) of\r\nMoa-birds measure as much as 39 inches.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 and 1847 Mr. Walter Mantell, eldest son of Dr. Mantell, who\r\nhad resided several years in New Zealand, explored every known\r\nlocality within his reach in the North Island. He also went into the\r\ninterior of the country and lived among the natives for the purpose of\r\ncollecting specimens, and of ascertaining whether any of these\r\ngigantic birds were still in existence; resolving, if there appeared\r\nto be the least chance of success, to penetrate into the unfrequented\r\nregions, and obtain a live Moa. The information gathered from the\r\nnatives offered no encouragement to follow up the pursuit, but tended\r\nto confirm the idea that this race of colossal bipeds was extinct. He\r\nsucceeded, however, in obtaining a most interesting collection of the\r\nbones of Moa-birds, belonging to birds of various species and genera,\r\ndiffering considerably in size. This collection was purchased by the\r\ntrustees of the British Museum for £200. Another collection was made\r\nby Mr. Percy Earle from a submerged swamp, visible only at low water,\r\nsituated on the south-eastern shore of the Middle Island. This\r\ncollection also was purchased by the trustees for the sum of £130. Mr.\r\nWalter Mantell, who described this locality, near Waikouaiti,\r\nseventeen miles north of Otago, thinks it was originally a swamp or\r\nmorass, in which the New Zealand flax once grew luxuriantly. The\r\nappearance and position of the bones are similar to those of the\r\nquadrupeds embedded in peat-bogs, as, for instance, the great Irish\r\nelk (see next chapter). They have acquired a rich umber colour, and\r\ntheir texture is firm and tough. They still contain a large proportion\r\nof animal matter. Unfortunately, even when Mr. Walter Mantell visited\r\nthis spot, the bed containing the bones was rapidly diminishing from\r\nthe inroads of the sea, and perhaps by this time is entirely washed\r\naway. Mr. W. Mantell, however, obtained fine specimens and feet of a\r\nlarge Moa-bird (Dinornis) in an upright position; and there seems to\r\nbe little doubt that the unfortunate bird was mired in the swamp, and\r\nperished on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe bones which he obtained from the North Island presented a\r\ndifferent appearance, being light and porous, and of a delicate\r\nfawn-colour. They were embedded in loose volcanic sand. Though\r\nperfect, they were as soft and plastic as putty, and required most\r\ncareful handling. They were dug out with great care, and exposed to\r\nthe air and sun to dry before they could be packed up and removed.\r\n\r\nThe natives were a great source of trouble to him, for as soon as they\r\ncaught sight of his operations they came down in swarms--men, women,\r\nand children, trampling on the bones he had laid out to dry, and\r\nseizing on every morsel they could get. The reason of this was that\r\ntheir cupidity and avarice had been excited by the large rewards given\r\nby Europeans in search of these treasures. Mixed with the bones he\r\nfound fragments of shells, and sometimes portions of the windpipe, or\r\ntrachea.\r\n\r\nOne portion of an egg which he found was large enough to enable him\r\nto calculate the size of the egg when complete. \"As a rough guess, I\r\nmay say that a common hat would have served as an egg-cup for it: what\r\na loss for the breakfast-table! And if many native traditions are\r\nworthy of credit, the ladies have cause to mourn the extinction of the\r\nMoa: the long feathers of its crest were by their remote ancestors\r\nprized above all other ornaments; those of the White Crane, which now\r\nbear the highest value, were mere pigeon's feathers in comparison.\"\r\n\r\nThe total number of species of Moa once inhabiting New Zealand was\r\nprobably at least fifteen, and, judging from the enormous\r\naccumulations of their bones found in some districts, they must have\r\nbeen extremely common, and probably went about in flocks. \"Birds of a\r\nfeather _flock_ together\" (proverb).\r\n\r\nIt is justly concluded, both from the vast number of bones discovered,\r\nand from the fact of their great diversity in size and other features,\r\nthat they must have had the country pretty much to themselves; or, in\r\nother words, they enjoyed immunity from the attacks of carnivorous\r\nquadrupeds. In whatever way the Moas originated in New Zealand, it is\r\nevident that the land was a favourable one, for they multiplied\r\nenormously, and spread from one end to the other. Not only was the\r\nnumber of individuals very large, but they belonged (according to Mr.\r\nF.W. Hutton) to no less than seven genera, containing twenty-five\r\ndifferent species, a remarkable fact which is unparalleled in any\r\nother part of the world. The species described by Professor Owen in\r\nhis great work,[75] vary in size from 3 ft. to 12 or even 14 ft. in\r\nheight, and differ greatly in their forms, some being tall and\r\nslender, and probably swift-footed like the ostrich, whilst others\r\nwere short and had stout limbs, such as Dinornis elephantopus (Fig.\r\n56), which was undoubtedly a bird of great strength, but very\r\nheavy-footed. Dinornis crassus also had stout limbs. (See Plate\r\nXXIII.)\r\n\r\n[75] Memoir on _The Extinct Wingless Birds of New Zealand_. London,\r\n1878. The beautiful drawing by Mr. Smit (Plate XXIV.) is from a\r\nphotograph in this valuable work representing the late Sir Richard\r\nOwen standing in his academic robes by the side of a specimen of the\r\nskeleton of the great Dinornis maximus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIII.\r\n\r\nMOA-BIRDS.\r\n\r\n_Dinornis giganteus._ _D. elephantopus._\r\n\r\nHeight 12 feet. A smaller species.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--_A._ Skeleton of the Elephant-footed Moa,\r\n_Dinornis elephantopus_, from New Zealand. _B._ Leg-bones of _Dinornis\r\ngiganteus_, representing a bird over 12 ft. high. _r_, _b_,\r\nfootprints.]\r\n\r\nThe Natural History Museum at South Kensington contains a valuable\r\ncollection of remains of Moa-birds. These skeletons may be seen in\r\nGallery No. 2 (at the end of the long gallery) in the glass cases R,\r\nR´, and S. Dinornis elephantopus (elephant-footed) is in front of the\r\nwindow. In D. giganteus the leg-bone (see Fig. 56) attains the\r\nenormous length of 3 ft., and in an allied species it is even 39 in.!\r\nThe next bone below (cannon bone) is sometimes more than half the\r\nlength of the leg-bone (tibia).\r\n\r\nA skeleton in one of the glass cases has a height of about 10-1/2 ft.,\r\nand it is concluded that the largest birds did not stand less than 12\r\nft., and possibly were 14 ft. high!\r\n\r\nDinornis parvus (the dwarf Moa) was only three feet high.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the trustees obtained, from a cave in Otago, the head, neck,\r\ntwo legs, and feet of a Moa (D. didinus), having the skin, still\r\npreserved in a dried state, covering the bones, and some few feathers\r\nof a reddish hue still attached to the leg (Table case 12). The rings\r\nof the windpipe may be seen _in situ_, the sclerotic plates of the\r\neye, and the sheaths of the claws. One foot also shows the hind claw\r\nstill attached.\r\n\r\nFrom traditions and other circumstances it is supposed that the\r\npresent natives of New Zealand came there not more than about six\r\nhundred years ago, and there is reason to believe that the ancient\r\nMaoris, when they landed, feasted on Moa-birds as long as any\r\nremained. Their extermination _probably_ only dates back to about the\r\nperiod at which the islands were thrice visited by Captain Cook,\r\n1769-1778. The Moa-bird is mixed up with their songs and stories, and\r\nthey even have a tradition of caravans being attacked by them. Still,\r\nsome people believe that they were killed off by the race which\r\ninhabited New Zealand before the Maoris came. But they must have been\r\nthere up to a time not far removed from the present. It is even said\r\nthat the \"runs\" made by them were visible on the sides of the hills up\r\nto a few years ago; and possibly they may still be visible. The\r\ncharred bones and egg-shells have been found mixed with charcoal where\r\nthe native ovens were formerly made, and their eggs are said to have\r\nbeen found in Maori graves. Mr. Hutton considers that in the North\r\nIsland they were exterminated three or four centuries ago, while in\r\nthe South Island they may have lingered a century longer.\r\n\r\nThe nearest ally of the Moa is the small Apteryx, or Kiwi, of New\r\nZealand, specimens of which may be seen at the Natural History Museum,\r\nat the end of the long gallery devoted to living birds. This bird,\r\nhowever, has a long pointed bill for probing in the soft mud for\r\nworms, whereas the bill of the Moa was short like that of an ostrich.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between the two is that, while the Kiwi still\r\nretains the rudiments of wing-bones, the Moa had hardly a vestige of\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the remains have been found of a bird probably related to\r\nthe Cassowaries, but at present imperfectly known. To this type of\r\nstruthious, or running bird, the name Dromornis has been given.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a remarkable fact that remains of another giant bird and\r\nits eggs have been found on the opposite side of the great Indian\r\nOcean, namely, in the island of Madagascar, the existence of which was\r\nfirst revealed by its eggs, found sunk in the swamps, but of which\r\nsome imperfect bones were afterwards discovered. One of these eggs was\r\nso enormous that its diameter was nearly fourteen inches, and was\r\nreckoned to be as big as three ostrich eggs, or 148 hen's eggs! This\r\nmeans a cubic content of more than two gallons! The natives search for\r\nthe eggs by probing in the soft mud of the swamps with long iron rods.\r\nA large and perfect specimen of an egg of this bird, such as was\r\nrecently exhibited at a meeting of the Zoological Society, is said to\r\nbe worth £50. What the dimensions of Æpyornis were it is impossible to\r\nsay, and it would be unsafe to venture a calculation from the size of\r\nthe egg.[76] The reader who wishes to see some of the remains of this\r\nhuge bird may be referred to the Natural History Museum. In wall case\r\nNo. 25, Gallery 2 (Geological Department), may be seen a tibia and\r\nplaster casts of other bones; also two entire eggs, many broken\r\npieces, and one plaster cast of an egg found in certain surface\r\ndeposits in Madagascar. In the same case may be seen bones of the Dodo\r\nfrom the isle of Mauritius. Unlike New Zealand, Madagascar possesses\r\nno living wingless bird. But in the neighbouring island of Mauritius\r\nthe Dodo has been exterminated less than three centuries ago. The\r\nlittle island of Rodriguez, in the same geographical province, has\r\nalso lost its wingless Solitaire.\r\n\r\n[76] From the size of a femur and tibia of _Æpyornis_ preserved in the\r\nParis Museum, it could not have been less in stature than the Dinornis\r\nelephantopus of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that we have three distinct groups of giant land\r\nbirds--the Moas, the Dromornis, and the Æpyornis,--occupying areas at\r\npresent widely separated by the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis raises the difficult but very interesting question, how they got\r\nthere; and the same applies to their living ancestors. The ostrich\r\nproper, Struthio camelus, inhabits Africa and Arabia; but there is\r\nevidence from history to show that it formerly existed in Beluchistan\r\nand Central Asia. And, going still further back, the geological record\r\ninforms us that, in the Pliocene period, they inhabited what is now\r\nNorthern India. In Australia we have the Cassowary (Casuarius) and the\r\nEmeu (Dromaius); in New Zealand, the Apteryx (or Kiwi). Now, as none\r\nof these birds can either fly or swim, it is impossible that they\r\ncould have reached these regions separated as they now are; and it is\r\nhardly likely that they arose spontaneously in each district from\r\ntotally different ancestors. But the new doctrine of evolution affords\r\na key to the problem, and tells us that they all sprang from a common\r\nancestor, of the struthious type (probably inhabiting the great\r\nnorthern continental area), and gradually migrated south along land\r\nareas now submerged. In this way we get some idea of the vast changes\r\nthat have taken place in the geography of the world during later\r\ngeological periods. Perhaps they were compelled to move south until\r\nthey reached abodes free from carnivorous enemies. Having done so,\r\nthey evidently flourished abundantly, especially in New Zealand, where\r\nthere are so few mammals, except those recently introduced by man.\r\n\r\nIn North America Professor Cope has reported a large wingless fossil\r\nbird from the Eocene strata of New Mexico. In England we have two\r\nsuch--namely, the Dasornis, from the London Clay of Sheppey (Eocene\r\nperiod), and the Gastornis, from the Woolwich beds near Croydon, and\r\nfrom Paris (also Eocene).\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that big struthious birds have a long history,\r\ngoing far back into the Tertiary era, and that they once had a much\r\nwider geographical range than they have now. Doubtless, future\r\ndiscoveries will tend to fill up the gaps between all these various\r\ntypes, both living and extinct, and to connect them together in one\r\nchain of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe last great find of Moa-birds in New Zealand took place only last\r\nyear, and was reported by a correspondent to the _Scotsman_ (November\r\n13, 1891), writing from Oamaru. In the letter that appeared at the\r\nabove date, our friend Mr. H. O. Forbes announces the discovery of an\r\nimmense number of bones, estimated to represent at least five hundred\r\nMoas! They were found in the neighbourhood of Oamaru. And, after some\r\npreliminary remarks, he continues as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The part of the field on which the remains were found bears no traces\r\nof any physical disturbance--_e.g._ of earthquake, or flood, or\r\nhurricane--that would account for the sudden destruction of a flock or\r\n'mob' of Moas. The Moa, when alive, carried in its crop--like our own\r\nhens--a quantity of stones to serve as a private coffee-mill for\r\ndigestive grinding; stones which, being somewhat in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of the giant bird, form, when found in one place, a 'heap'\r\nof stones which are easily identified as a Moa heap, and nothing else.\r\nAnd in the present case the heap was here and there found in such\r\nrelation to the bones of an individual bird as to show that the Moa\r\nmust have died on that spot, and remained there quietly undisturbed.\r\nFurther, the number of birds represented by the exhumed remains is so\r\ngreat that the living birds could not have stood together on the space\r\nof ground on which the remains were found lying. And there is not on\r\nany of the bones any trace of such violence as must have left its mark\r\nif the death of the birds had been caused by a Moa-hunting mankind.\r\nFinally, it does not appear that in this particular district there\r\never has been, at any traceable period of the physical history of the\r\nland, a forest vegetation, such as might suggest that the catastrophe\r\nwas caused by fire.\r\n\r\n\"The question how to account for the slaughter is raised likewise by\r\ntwo previous finds of Moa bones. The first of these, at Glenmark, in\r\nCanterbury, was the most memorable, because, being the first, it made\r\nthe deepest impression. The second great find, far inland, up the\r\nMolineux River, otherwise the Clutha, was beneath the diluvium that is\r\nnow worked by the gold-digger. The spot must have been the site of a\r\nlagoon, at one point of which there was a spring. Round about this\r\npoint there were found the remains of, it was reckoned, five hundred\r\nindividual Moas. The bones were quietly _laid_ there, with, in some\r\ncases, the 'heap' of digestive stones _in situ_ along with the\r\nskeletons. And Mr. Booth, whose elaborate investigation of this case\r\nis recorded in the annual volume of _The New Zealand Institute_,\r\nsuggested the theory that the climate of New Zealand was changing to a\r\ndegree of cold intolerable to Moa nature; and that the birds, fleeing\r\nfrom its rigour, sought comfort in the spring of water, sheltering\r\ntheir featherless breast in it, and so dozing out of this troubled\r\nlife. And in this new find the wonder comes back unmitigated, as a\r\nmystery unsolved. For here is no bog deep enough, as in the first\r\ninstance, nor lagoon spring, as in the second, to account for that\r\nmultitude of giant birds dying in one spot.\r\n\r\n\"Another curious puzzle is, on close inspection, found everywhere in\r\nthe Moa bone discoveries. It is hardly possible to make sure that the\r\nbones of any one complete Moa skeleton all belong to the same\r\nindividual I heard some one say the other day that it is not certain\r\nthat any Moa in any earthly museum has all his own bones, and only his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"A main interest of such a find lies not in the power of supplying\r\nmuseums with specimens of what is rapidly disappearing from the face\r\nof the world, but in the possibility of finding species of Moa that\r\nhave not hitherto been tabulated. Whether any new species have been\r\nbrought to light on this occasion the experts will not say until there\r\nhas been time to make a careful study of the bones, nor do they\r\nventure on any theory to account for there being so many individual\r\nbirds dead in that one place, where there appears to be no room for\r\nthe explanations offered in connection with previous great finds. The\r\ndate of these birds appears to be earlier than that of the coming of\r\nthe Maoris into New Zealand, say five or six hundred years ago, as the\r\nMaori memory appears to have in it no trace of feasting on these giant\r\nMoas, but celebrates the rat-hunt in its ancient heroic song. And your\r\nreaders may picture their appearance by noticing the fact that one of\r\nthe recently found bones must have belonged to a Moa fourteen feet\r\nhigh!\"\r\n\r\n     Note.--For further information on this interesting subject,\r\n     the reader is referred to a paper in _Natural Science_,\r\n     October, 1892, by Mr. F. W. Hutton. In a valuable paper, read\r\n     before the Royal Geographical Society by Mr. H. O. Forbes,\r\n     March 13, 1893, the lecturer alluded to the important fact\r\n     that bone belonging to big extinct struthious birds have been\r\n     discovered in Patagonia. This is interesting news as bearing\r\n     upon the theory of a former Antarctic continent connecting\r\n     Australia and New Zealand with South Africa, and perhaps even\r\n     with South America. After the lecture, to which we listened\r\n     with great interest, the subject was discussed by Mr. Slater,\r\n     Dr. Günther, and Dr. Henry Woodward. For ourselves we can see\r\n     no great difficulty in accepting the theory that such a\r\n     continent once existed, though it is out of harmony with the\r\n     now rather fashionable theory of \"the permanence of ocean\r\n     basins\"--a doctrine which seems to have been pressed too far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT IRISH DEER AND STELLER'S SEA-COW.\r\n\r\n     \"And, above all others, we should protect and hold sacred\r\n     those types, Nature's masterpieces, which are first singled\r\n     out for destruction on account of their size, or splendour,\r\n     or rarity, and that false detestable glory which is accorded\r\n     to their most successful slayers. In ancient times the spirit\r\n     of life shone brightest in these; and when others that shared\r\n     the earth with them were taken by death they were left, being\r\n     more worthy of perpetuation. Like immortal flowers they have\r\n     drifted down to us on the ocean of time, and their\r\n     strangeness and beauty bring to our imaginations a dream and\r\n     a picture of that unknown world, immeasurably far removed,\r\n     where man was not: and when they perish, something of the\r\n     gladness goes out of nature, and the sunshine loses something\r\n     of its brightness.\"--W. H. Hudson, in _The Naturalist in La\r\n     Plata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the extinct animals of prehistoric times the \"Great Irish\r\nElk,\"[77] as it is generally called, deserves special notice, both from\r\nthe enormous size of its antlers, and from the fact that its remains\r\nare exceedingly plentiful in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[77] The term \"Elk\" is misleading, for it is not an elk (_alces_) at\r\nall, but a true _Cervus_ (stag). It should be called \"the Great Irish\r\nDeer.\"\r\n\r\nThis magnificent creature, so well depicted by our artist (Plate\r\nXXV.), was, however, by no means confined to Ireland; its remains are\r\nfound in many parts of Great Britain, particularly in cave deposits,\r\nand also on the Continent. Some writers think that it was contemporary\r\nwith men in Ireland; it may have been so, but at present the question\r\ncannot be considered as proved. Mr. R. J. Ussher, who found its\r\nremains in a cave near Cappagh, Cappoquin, thinks he has obtained\r\nevidence to show that it was hunted by man at the time when he hunted\r\nreindeer in this part of Europe, but the age of the strata containing\r\nthe remains is doubtful. Again, there is a rib in the Dublin Museum\r\nwith a perforation which is sometimes taken to be the result of a\r\nwound from a dart, arrow, or spear; but the wound may have been\r\ninflicted by one of the sharp tynes in a fight between two bucks.\r\n\r\nDr. Hart mentions the discovery of a human body in gravel, under\r\neleven feet of peat, soaked in bog-water, in good preservation, and\r\ncompletely clothed in antique garments of hair, which it has been\r\nconjectured might be that of the Great Deer. But if some individual\r\nanimal had perished and left its body under the like circumstances,\r\nits hide and hair ought equally to have been preserved. Dr. Molyneux,\r\nto whom we owe the first account of its discovery, says that its\r\nextinction in Ireland has occurred \"so many ages past, as there\r\nremains among us not the least record in writing, or any manner of\r\ntradition, that makes so much as mention of its name; as that most\r\nlaborious inquirer into the pretended ancient but certainly fabulous\r\nhistory of this country, Mr. Roger O'Flaherty, the author of _Ogygia_,\r\nhas lately informed me.\"[78]\r\n\r\n[78] _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. xix. p. 490.\r\n\r\nIn the romance of the \"Niebelungen,\" now immortalised by Wagner, which\r\nwas written in the thirteenth century, the word _shelch_ occurs, and\r\nis applied to one of the beasts slain in a great hunt a few hundred\r\nyears before that time in Germany. This word has been cited by some\r\nnaturalists as probably signifying the Great Irish Deer. But this is\r\nmere conjecture, and the word might apply to some big Red Deer. The\r\ntotal silence of Cæsar and Tacitus respecting such remarkable animals\r\nrenders it highly improbable that they were known to the ancient\r\nBritons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Skeleton of Great Irish Deer, _Cervus\r\ngiganteus_, from shell-marl beneath the peat, Ireland. Antlers over 9\r\nfeet across.]\r\n\r\nTwo entire skeletons of the male, with antlers measuring a little over\r\nnine feet from tip to tip, and one skeleton of the hornless doe, are\r\nto be seen set up in the middle of the long gallery No. 1 at the\r\nNatural History Museum. The drawing in Fig. 57 is from a specimen in\r\nthe Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons (Lincoln's Inn Fields).\r\nThe height of this specimen to the summit of the antlers is 10 ft. 4\r\nin. The span of the antlers, from tip to tip, is 8 ft. (in the living\r\nMoose it is only 4 ft). The weight of the skull and antlers together\r\nis 76 lbs., but those of another specimen belonging to the Royal\r\nDublin Society weigh 87 lbs. This great extinct deer surpassed the\r\nlargest Wapite (Cervus Canadensis) in size, and its antlers were very\r\nmuch larger, wider, and heavier. In some cases the antlers have\r\nmeasured more than 11 ft. from tip to tip. The body of the animal, as\r\nwell as its antlers, were larger and stronger than in any existing\r\ndeer. The limbs are stouter, as might be expected from the great\r\nweight of the head and neck. Another and more striking feature is the\r\ngreat size of the vertebræ of the neck; this was necessary in order to\r\nform a column capable of supporting the head and its massive antlers.\r\n(See Plate XXV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT IRISH DEER, CERVUS MEGACEROS.\r\n\r\nHeight to the summit of the antlers 10 feet; spread of antlers 11\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\nThe first tolerably perfect skeleton was found in the Isle of Man, and\r\npresented by the Duke of Athol to the Edinburgh Museum. It was figured\r\nin Cuvier's _Ossemens Fossiles_. Besides those already mentioned at\r\nSouth Kensington and Dublin, there is one in the Woodwardian Museum at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that, like all existing deer, the animal shed its\r\nantlers periodically, and such shed antlers have been found. When it\r\nis recollected that all the osseous matter of which they are composed\r\nmust have been drawn from the blood carried along certain arteries to\r\nthe head, in the course of a few months, our wonder may well be\r\nexcited at the vigorous circulation that took place in these parts.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Deer the antlers, weighing about 24 lbs., are developed in\r\nthe course of about ten weeks; but what is that compared to the growth\r\nof over 80 lbs. weight in some three or four months?\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the remains discovered in Ireland were\r\nfound in peat; they occur not in the peat, but in shell-marls and in\r\nclays _under the peat_. This is an important point For if the remains\r\n_were_ found in the peat, they would prove that the Great Deer\r\nsurvived into a later period; instead of being (as is believed from\r\ngeological evidence) contemporary with the Mammoth and Woolly\r\nRhinoceros in this country, and then disappearing from view. As\r\nalready stated, it existed on the Continent, and may there have been\r\nexterminated by man.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Williams, who has explored several peat-bogs in Ireland,\r\nmarking the site of ancient lakes, and found many specimens in beds\r\nunderlying the peat, has given much interesting information bearing\r\nupon the question of the period when the Great Deer inhabited Ireland,\r\nand the manner in which it was preserved in the lake-beds.[79] He spent\r\nten weeks in 1876-77, excavating deer remains in the bog of\r\nBallybetagh, and subsequently made similar excavations in the counties\r\nof Mayo, Limerick, and Meath. These peat-bogs occupy the basins of\r\nlakes, the deeper hollows of which have long since been silted up with\r\nmarls, clays, and sands, and in this silt, or mud, the plants which\r\nproduced the peat grew. In all the bogs examined he found a general\r\nresemblance in the order of succession of the beds, with only slight\r\nvariations in the nature of the materials such as might be easily\r\naccounted for by differences in the surrounding rocks. In these\r\ndeposits the geologist may read, as in a book, the successive changes\r\nin climate that have taken place since the time when the country was\r\ndeeply covered with snow and ice during the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n[79] _Geological Magazine_, new series, vol. viii. (1881), p. 354.\r\n\r\nHe found at the bottom of the old Ballybetagh Lake, and resting on the\r\ntrue Boulder Clay (a product of the ice-sheet), a fine stiff clay\r\nwhich seems to have been brought in by the action of rain washing fine\r\nclay out of the Boulder Clay, that nearly covered the land, and\r\ndepositing it in the lake. This action probably took place during a\r\nperiod of thaw, when the climate was damp, from the melting of so much\r\nice, and the rainfall considerable. Then the climate improved, the\r\ncold of the Glacial period passed away, and the climate became warm.\r\nDuring this phase the next stratum was formed, consisting chiefly of\r\nvegetable remains. The summers must have been unusually warm, dry, and\r\nfavourable to the growth of vegetation on the bed of the lake. About\r\nthis time the Great Irish Deer appeared on the scene, for its remains\r\nwere found resting on this layer, or stratum, in a brownish clay.\r\nThis deposit also was the product of a time when the climate was mild.\r\nIt is a true lake-sediment, with seams of clay and fine sand, the\r\nlatter having been brought down by heavy rainfall from the hills, just\r\nas at the present day.\r\n\r\nNow, we have to consider how these Great Deer got buried in this\r\ndeposit. How did they get drowned? They may have gone into the lakes\r\nto escape from wolves, or possibly to escape from ancient Britons (but\r\nthat is still doubtful). Perhaps they went into the water to wallow,\r\nas is usual with deer, or they may have ventured to swim the lakes\r\n(see p. 19). To enter the lake from a sandy shore would be easy\r\nenough, but, on reaching the other side, they might find a soft mud\r\ninstead, into which their small feet would sink; and the more they\r\nplunged and struggled, the worse became their plight, until at last,\r\nweary and exhausted, the heavy antlers pressed their heads down under\r\nthe water, and they were drowned.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, according to this theory, that either the entire\r\nanimal ought to be found, or even its legs, sticking in the clay. For\r\na few days it might remain so, but the motion of the waters of the\r\nlake would sway the body to and fro, while the gases due to\r\ndecomposition would render it buoyant, and perhaps raise it bodily off\r\nthe bottom. Then it might float before the wind, its head hanging\r\ndown, till it reached the lee-side of the lake. Then the antlers would\r\nget fastened in mud near the shore, thus mooring the body until at\r\nlast so much of the flesh of the neck had decayed that the body got\r\nseparated from it, leaving the head and antlers near the shore.\r\n\r\nNearly a hundred heads had been found in this lake previous to Mr.\r\nWilliams's explorations, and yet scarcely six skeletons. At first it\r\nis somewhat puzzling to account for this scarcity of skeletons\r\ncompared with heads; but very likely the bodies, minus their heads,\r\nwere carried right out of the lake, down a river, and perhaps reached\r\nthe sea or got stranded somewhere down the river in such a way that\r\nthe bones were never covered up. But in the Limerick bogs heads and\r\nskeletons were often found together. In that district the lakes were\r\nprobably shallow and with but a feeble current, and so the body never\r\nfloated away. This explanation by Mr. Williams seems satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHe reports that the female skulls were rarely met with. Either they\r\nwere more timid in swimming lakes, or, having no antlers, they may\r\nhave succeeded in getting out, or the care of their young ones may\r\nhave kept them out of the lakes during the summer months. The clay in\r\nwhich the remains occur is succeeded by another bed of pure clay,\r\nwhich _never_ yields any skulls or bones. This, Mr. Williams thinks,\r\nwas deposited at a time when the climate was more or less severe, and\r\nthe musk-ox, reindeer, and other arctic animals came down from more\r\nnorthern regions, even down to the south of France. He concludes that\r\nthis period marks the extinction of the Great Deer in Ireland, whether\r\nrightly or wrongly it is hard to say. Many observers are inclined to\r\nthink that it lived on to a later period. An interesting fact, having\r\nsome bearing on the question, is this: that the bones in some cases\r\neven yet retain their marrow in the state of a fatty substance, which\r\nwill burn with a clear lambent flame. Evidence such as this seems to\r\npoint to a more recent date for its extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteller's Sea-Cow.[80]\r\n\r\n[80] For fuller information, see the _Geological Magazine_, decade\r\niii. vol. ii. p. 412. Paper by Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nThe Sirenia of the present day form a remarkable group of aquatic\r\nherbivorous animals, really quite distinct from the Cetacea (whales\r\nand dolphins), although sometimes erroneously classed with them. In\r\nthe former group are the Dugong and the Manatee. These creatures pass\r\ntheir whole life in the water, inhabiting the shallow bogs, estuaries,\r\nand lagoons, and large rivers, but never venturing far away from the\r\nshore. They browse beneath the surface on aquatic plants, as the\r\nterrestrial herbivorous mammals feed upon the green pastures on land.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the tales of mermen and mermaids owe their origin to\r\nthese creatures, as well as to seals, and even walruses. The\r\nPortuguese and Spaniards give the Manatee a name signifying\r\n\"Woman-fish,\" and the Dutch call the Dugong the \"Little Bearded Man.\"\r\nA very little imagination, and a memory only for the marvellous,\r\ndoubtless sufficed to complete the metamorphosis of the half-woman, or\r\nman, half-fish, into a siren, a mermaid, or a merman. Hence the\r\ngeneral name Sirenia.\r\n\r\nThe Manatee (_Manatus_) inhabits the west coast and rivers of tropical\r\nAfrica, and the east coast and rivers of tropical America, the West\r\nIndies, and Florida.\r\n\r\nThe Dugong (_Halicore_) extends along the Red Sea coasts, the shores\r\nof India, and the adjacent islands, and goes as far as the northern\r\nand eastern coasts of Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Skeleton of _Rhytina gigas_ (Steller's\r\n\"Sea-Cow\"), from a peat deposit, Behring's Island.]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable Sirenian is the Rhytina gigas, or \"Steller's\r\nSea-Cow.\" Early in 1885 the trustees of the British Museum acquired a\r\nnearly complete skeleton of this animal, now extinct, from peat\r\ndeposits in Behring's Island, of Pleistocene age. Formerly it was\r\nabundant along the shores of Kamtchatka, the Kurile Islands, and\r\nAlaska. It was first discovered by the German naturalist, Steller,\r\nwho, in company with Vitus Behring, a captain in the Russian Navy and\r\na celebrated navigator of the northern seas, was with his vessel and\r\ncrew cast away upon Behring's Island (where Behring died) in 1741.\r\nSteller's original description is preserved in the _Memoirs of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences St. Petersburg_. He saw it alive during his long\r\nenforced residence on the island. In the course of forty years,\r\n1742-1782, it appears to have been exterminated, probably for the sake\r\nof its flesh and hide, around both Behring's Island and Copper Island,\r\nto the shores of which it was, in Steller's time, limited.\r\n\r\nFig. 58 shows its skeleton, 19 ft. 6 in. long, now preserved in the\r\nGeological Collection at South Kensington (Glass-case N). The\r\nskeletons are found, in the islands, at a distance from the shore in\r\nold raised beaches and peat-mosses, deeply buried and thickly\r\novergrown with grass. They are discovered by boring into the peat with\r\nan iron rod, just as timber is found in Irish peat-bogs. (See\r\nrestoration, Plate XXVI.)\r\n\r\nSteller records that when he came to Behring's Island, the Sea-cows\r\nfed in the shallows along the shore, and collected in herds like\r\ncattle. Every few minutes they raised their heads in order to get more\r\nair before descending again to browse on the thick sea-weed (probably\r\nLaminaria) surrounding the coast. With regard to their habits, they\r\nwere very slow in their movements: mild and inoffensive in\r\ndisposition. Their colour was dark brown, sometimes varied with spots.\r\nThe skin was naked; but thick, hard, and rugged. They are said to have\r\nsometimes reached a length of thirty-five feet, when full grown. Most\r\nof their time was spent in browsing, and whilst so occupied, were not\r\neasily disturbed. Their attachment to each other was great, so that\r\nwhen one was harpooned, the others made great attempts to rescue it.\r\nAccording to Steller, they were so heavy that it required forty men\r\nwith ropes to drag the body of one to land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVI.\r\n\r\nSTELLER'S SEA-COW, RHYTINA GIGAS.\r\n\r\nFound alive by Steller at Behring's Island. Length 19 feet 6 inches.]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1743, the news of the discovery of Behring Island reached\r\nKamtchatka, several expeditions were fitted out for the purpose of\r\nhunting the sea-cow and the various fur-bearing animals, such as the\r\nsea-otter, fur seal, and blue fox, which are found there; and very\r\nsoon many whaling vessels began to stop there to lay in a supply of\r\nsea-cow meat for food. So great was the destruction wrought by these\r\nwhalers and fur-hunters that in 1754, only thirteen years after its\r\ndiscovery, the sea-cow had become practically exterminated. In 1768,\r\naccording to the investigations of Dr. L. Stejneger of the U. S.\r\nNational Museum, Washington, who has made a most careful study of the\r\nquestion, this large and important marine mammal became wholly\r\nextinct, the last individual ever seen alive having been killed in\r\nthat year; and the fate which overtook Rhytina so speedily has almost\r\nbecome that of the buffalo, and will as certainly become that of the\r\nfur seal unless it be protected.\r\n\r\nIt may interest the reader, especially if he be a traveller, to know\r\nthat, besides the fine specimen of Rhytina in the Natural History\r\nMuseum, already alluded to, good skeletons are possessed by the\r\nMuseums of St. Petersburg, Helsingsfors (Finland), Stockholm, U. S.\r\nNational Museum, Washington, as well as portions of skeletons by other\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nThe Sirenians are an ancient race, for their remains have been found\r\nin Tertiary strata, of various ages, from Eocene to Pleistocene, over\r\nthe greater part of Europe--in England, Holland, Belgium, France,\r\nGermany, Austria, and Italy; also near Cairo. In the New World, fossil\r\nSirenians have been found in South Carolina, New Jersey, and Jamaica.\r\n\r\nAnother European species is the Halitherium, from the Miocene rocks of\r\nHesse-Darmstadt, of which a cast may be seen in the Natural History\r\nMuseum, South Kensington. Its length is 7 ft. 8 in. The teeth in this\r\nform resembled those of the Dugong.\r\n\r\nThe Rhytina was probably intermediate between the Dugong and the\r\nManatee, judging from the casts of its brain-cavity. Its brain was\r\nvery small considering the size of the animals. Altogether, as many as\r\nfourteen fossil genera and thirty species are known. Evidently, then,\r\nthe old Sirenia were once a much more flourishing race. At present,\r\nthey are confined exclusively to the tropical regions of the earth,\r\nand their past distribution, as revealed to the geologists, adds one\r\nmore proof to the now well-established fact, that throughout most of\r\nthe Tertiary era the climate of northern latitudes was very much\r\nwarmer than now--in fact, sub-tropical. What cause, or causes, brought\r\nabout so great a change, we cannot stay to consider here.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it only remains to express a hope that the reader may\r\nhave been interested in our humble endeavours to describe some of the\r\nlargest, most strange, and wonderful forms of life that in remote ages\r\nhave found a home on this planet. And perhaps a few of our readers may\r\nbe induced to add a new and never-failing interest to their lives by\r\nsearching in the stony record for traces of the world's \"lost\r\ncreations.\" If so, our labour will not have been in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Stratified Rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n

Henry Lee, formerly naturalist to the Brighton Aquarium, discusses\r\nthe question of \"The Great Sea-Serpent\" in an interesting little book,\r\nentitled _Sea Monsters Unmasked_, illustrated (1883), published as one\r\nof the Handbooks issued in connection with the International Fisheries\r\nExhibition. He goes fully into the history of the subject, and shows\r\nhow some of the appearances described may be accounted for; but yet is\r\ninclined to think that there may exist in the sea animals of great\r\nsize unknown to science, and concludes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"This brings us face to face with the question, 'Is it, then, so\r\nimpossible that there may exist some great sea creature, or creatures,\r\nwith which zoologists are hitherto unacquainted, that it is necessary\r\nin every case to regard the authors of such narratives as wilfully\r\nuntruthful or mistaken in their observations, if their descriptions\r\nare irreconcilable with something already known?' I, for one, am of\r\nthe opinion that there is no such impossibility. Calamaries or squids\r\nof the ordinary size have, from time immemorial, been amongst the\r\ncommonest and best known of marine animals in many seas; but only a\r\nfew years ago any one who expressed his belief in one formidable\r\nenough to capsize a boat or pull a man out of one was derided for his\r\ncredulity, although voyagers had constantly reported that in the\r\nIndian seas they were so dreaded that the natives always carried\r\nhatchets with them in their canoes, with which to cut off the arms or\r\ntentacles of these creatures, if attacked by them. We now know that\r\ntheir existence is no fiction; for individuals have been captured\r\nmeasuring more than fifty feet, and some are reported to have measured\r\neighty feet in total length. As marine snakes some feet in length, and\r\nhaving fin-like tails adapted for swimming, abound over an extensive\r\nrange, and are frequently met with far at sea, I cannot regard it as\r\nimpossible that some of these also may attain to an abnormal and\r\ncolossal development. Dr. Andrew Wilson, who has given much attention\r\nto this subject, is of the opinion that 'in this huge development of\r\nordinary forms we discover the true and natural law of the production\r\nof the giant serpent of the sea.' It goes far at any rate towards\r\naccounting for its supposed appearance. I am convinced that whilst\r\nnaturalists have been searching amongst the vertebrata for a solution\r\nof the problem, the great unknown, and therefore unrecognised,\r\nCalamaries, by their elongated cylindrical bodies and peculiar mode of\r\nswimming, have played the part of the sea-serpent in many a\r\nwell-authenticated incident. In other cases, such as those mentioned\r\nby 'Pontoppidan' (_History of Norway_), the supposed vertical\r\nundulations of the snake seen out of water have been the burly bodies\r\nof so many porpoises swimming in line--the connecting undulations\r\nbeneath the surface have been supplied by the imagination. The dorsal\r\nfins of basking sharks, as figured by Dr. Andrew Wilson, may have\r\nfurnished the 'ridge of fins;' an enormous conger is not an\r\nimpossibility; a giant turtle may have done duty, with its propelling\r\nflippers and broad back; or a marine snake of enormous size may really\r\nhave been seen. But if we accept as accurate the observations recorded\r\n(which I certainly do not in all cases, for they are full of errors\r\nand mistakes), the difficulty is not entirely met, even by this last\r\nadmission, for the instances are very few in which an Ophidian\r\nproper--a true serpent--is indicated. There has seemed to be wanting\r\nan animal having a long snake-like neck, a small head, and a slender\r\nbody, and propelling itself by paddles.\r\n\r\n\"The similarity of such an animal to the Plesiosaurus of old was\r\nremarkable. That curious compound reptile, which has been compared\r\nwith 'a snake threaded through the body of a turtle,' is described by\r\nDean Buckland as having 'the head of a lizard, the teeth of a\r\ncrocodile, a neck of enormous length resembling the body of a serpent,\r\nthe ribs of a chameleon, and the paddles of a whale.' In the number of\r\nits cervical vertebræ (about thirty-three) it surpasses that of the\r\nlongest-necked bird, the swan.\r\n\r\n\"The form and probable movements of this ancient Saurian agree so\r\nmarkedly with some of the accounts given of 'the great sea-serpent,'\r\nthat Mr. Edward Newman advanced the opinion that the closest\r\naffinities of the latter would be found to be with the Enaliosaurians,\r\nor Marine Lizards, whose fossil remains are so abundant in the Oolite\r\nand the Lias. This view has been taken by other writers, and\r\nemphatically by Mr. Gosse. Neither he nor Mr. Newman insist that 'the\r\ngreat unknown' must be the Plesiosaurus itself. Mr. Gosse says, 'I\r\nshould not look for any species, scarcely for any genus, to be\r\nperpetuated from the Oolitic period to the present. Admitting the\r\nactual continuation of the order Enaliosauria, it would be, I think,\r\nquite in conformity with general analogy to find some salient features\r\nof several extinct forms.'\r\n\r\n\"The form and habits of the recently recognised gigantic cuttles\r\naccount for so many appearances which, without knowledge of them, were\r\ninexplicable when Mr. Gosse and Mr. Newman wrote, that I think this\r\ntheory is not forced upon us. Mr. Gosse well and clearly sums up the\r\nevidence as follows: 'Carefully comparing the independent narratives\r\nof English witnesses of known character and position, most of them\r\nbeing officers under the Crown, we have a creature possessing the\r\nfollowing characteristics: (1) The general form of a serpent; (2)\r\ngreat length, say above sixty feet; (3) head considered to resemble\r\nthat of a serpent; (4) neck from twelve to sixteen inches in diameter;\r\n(5) appendages on the head, neck, or back, resembling a crest or mane\r\n(considerable discrepancy in details); (6) colour, dark brown or\r\ngreen, streaked or spotted with white; (7) swims at surface of the\r\nwater with a rapid or slow movement, the head and neck projected and\r\nelevated above the surface; (8) progression steady and uniform, the\r\nbody straight, but capable of being thrown into convolutions; (9)\r\nspouts in the manner of a whale; (10) like a long \"nun-buoy.\"' He\r\nconcludes with the question, 'To which of the recognised classes of\r\ncreated beings can this huge rover of the ocean be referred?'\r\n\r\n\"I reply, 'to the Cephalopoda.' There is not one of the above\r\njudiciously summarised characteristics that is not supplied by the\r\ngreat Calamary, and its ascertained habits and peculiar mode of\r\nlocomotion.\r\n\r\n\"Only a geologist can fully appreciate how enormously the balance of\r\nprobability is contrary to the supposition that any of the gigantic\r\nmarine Saurians of the secondary deposits should have continued to\r\nlive up to the present time. And yet I am bound to say that this does\r\nnot amount to an impossibility, for the evidence against it is\r\nentirely negative. Nor is the conjecture that there may be in\r\nexistence some congeners of these great reptiles inconsistent with\r\nzoological science. Dr. J. E. Gray, late of the British Museum, a\r\nstrict zoologist, is cited by Mr. Gosse as having long ago expressed\r\nhis opinion that some undescribed form exists which is intermediate\r\nbetween the tortoises and the serpents.\" (This is quoted by Mr. Lee in\r\na footnote.)\r\n\r\n\"Professor Agassiz, too, is adduced by a correspondent of the\r\n_Zoologist_ (p. 2395), as having said concerning the present existence\r\nof the Enaliosaurian type, that 'it would be in precise conformity\r\nwith analogy that such an animal should exist in the American seas, as\r\nhe had found numerous instances in which the fossil forms of the old\r\nworld were represented by living types in the new.'\r\n\r\n\"On this point, Mr. Newman records in the _Zoologist_ (p 2356), an\r\nactual testimony which he considers 'in all respects the most\r\ninteresting natural history fact of the present century.' He writes--\r\n\r\n\"'Captain the Hon. George Hope states that when in H.M.S. _Fly_, in\r\nthe Gulf of California, the sea being perfectly calm, he saw at the\r\nbottom a large marine animal with the head and general figure of the\r\nalligator, except that the neck was much longer, and that instead of\r\nlegs the creature had four large flappers, somewhat like those of\r\nturtles, the anterior pair being larger than the posterior, the\r\ncreature was distinctly visible, and all its movements could be\r\nobserved with ease; it appeared to be pursuing its prey at the bottom\r\nof the sea; its movements were somewhat serpentine, and an appearance\r\nof annulations, or ring-like divisions of the body, was distinctly\r\nperceptible. Captain Hope made this relation in company, and as a\r\nmatter of conversation. When I heard it from the gentleman to whom it\r\nwas narrated, I inquired whether Captain Hope was acquainted with\r\nthose remarkable fossil animals, Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri, the\r\nsupposed forms of which so nearly corresponded with what he describes\r\nas having seen alive, and I cannot find that he had heard of them; the\r\nalligator being the only animal he mentioned as bearing a partial\r\nsimilarity to the creature in question.'\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, the estimated dimensions of this creature are not\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\"That negative evidence alone is an unsafe basis for argument against\r\nthe existence of unknown animals, the following illustrations will\r\nshow:--\r\n\r\n\"During the deep-sea dredgings of H.M.S. _Lightning_, _Porcupine_, and\r\n_Challenger_, many new species of mollusca and others, which had been\r\nsupposed to have been extinct ever since the Chalk, were brought to\r\nlight; and by the deep-sea trawlings of the last-mentioned ship there\r\nhave been brought up from great depths fishes of unknown species, and\r\nwhich could not exist near the surface, owing to the distention and\r\nrupture of their air-bladder when removed from the pressure of deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gosse mentions that the ship in which he made the voyage to\r\nJamaica was surrounded in the North Atlantic, for seventeen continuous\r\nhours, by a troop of whales of large size, of an undescribed species,\r\nwhich on no other occasion has fallen under scientific observation.\r\nUnique specimens of other Cetaceans are also recorded.\r\n\r\n\"We have evidence, to which attention has been directed by Mr. A. D.\r\nBartlett, that 'even on land there exists at least one of the largest\r\nmammals, probably in thousands, of which only one individual has been\r\nbrought to notice, namely, the hairy-eared, two-horned rhinoceros (_R.\r\nLasiotis_), now in the Zoological Gardens, London. It was captured in\r\n1868, at Chittagong, in India, where for years collectors and\r\nnaturalists have worked and published lists of the animals met with,\r\nand yet no knowledge of this great beast was ever before obtained, nor\r\nis there any portion of one in any museum. It remains unique.\r\n\r\n\"I have arrived at the following conclusions: 1. That without\r\nstraining resemblances, or casting a doubt upon narratives not proved\r\nto be erroneous, the various appearances of the supposed 'great\r\nsea-serpent' may now be nearly all accounted for by the forms and\r\nhabits of known animals; especially if we admit, as proposed by Dr.\r\nAndrew Wilson, that some of them, including the marine snakes, may,\r\nlike the cuttles, attain to extraordinary size. 2. That to assume that\r\nnaturalists have perfect cognisance of every existing marine animal of\r\nlarge size, would be quite unwarrantable. It appears to me more than\r\nprobable that many marine animals, unknown to science, and some of\r\nthem of gigantic size, may have their ordinary habitat in the sea, and\r\nonly occasionally come to the surface; and I think it not impossible\r\nthat amongst them may be marine snakes of greater dimensions than we\r\nare aware of, and even a creature having close affinities with the old\r\nsea-reptiles whose fossil skeletons tell of their magnitude and\r\nabundance in past ages.\r\n\r\n\"It is most desirable that every supposed appearance of 'the Great\r\nSea-Serpent' shall be faithfully noted and described; and I hope that\r\nno truthful observer will be deterred from reporting such an\r\noccurrence by fear of the disbelief of naturalists or the ridicule of\r\nwitlings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF BRITISH LOCALITIES WHERE REMAINS OF THE MAMMOTH HAVE BEEN\r\nDISCOVERED.[81]\r\n\r\n[81] From Mr. Leith Adams's Monograph on _British Fossil Elephants_.\r\nPalæontographical Society, London. 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

By the courtesy of the proprietors of _Natural Science_, we are\r\nenabled to reproduce two drawings (Fig. 59) from the September number,\r\nillustrating a paper by Mr. Lydekker, in which he gives a _résumé_ of\r\nthe latest intelligence with regard to Ichthyosaurian reptiles.\r\n\r\n[82] Ueber einen neuen Fund von _Ichthyosaurus_ in Würtemberg. _Neues\r\nJahrbuch f. Mineralogie_, 1892, vol. ii. pp. 87-90. The same author\r\nhas published a valuable monograph, with beautiful plates, entitled\r\n_Die Ichthysaurier der Süddentschen Trias- und Jura-Ablagerungen_.\r\n4to. Tübingen, 1891.\r\n\r\nIn the present year (1892) there has been discovered in the Lias of\r\nWürtemberg the skeleton of an Ichthyosaur, in which the outline of the\r\nfleshy parts is completely preserved (see lower figure). The reader\r\nwill see from the figure that the tail-fin is very large, and the\r\nbackbone appears to run into the lower lobe. Such a tail-fin as this\r\nimpression indicates must have resembled that of the shark's, only it\r\nis wider; but the shark's backbone runs into the _upper_ lobe. Sir\r\nRichard Owen long ago foretold the existence of this appendage, and\r\nthe discovery, coming now (when his life is despaired of), adds one\r\nmore tribute to his genius. Behind the triangular fin on the back\r\ncomes a row of horny excrescences reminding us of those of the crested\r\nnewt.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Fraas remarks, this discovery shows how closely analogous\r\nIchthyosaurs were in form to fishes, and further justifies the title\r\nof \"fish-lizards.\" He considers that they did _not_ visit the shore.\r\nThe reader will find much valuable matter in Mr. Lydekker's paper,\r\nabove referred to. The following extract refers to the question of\r\ntheir reproduction: \"It has long been known that certain large\r\nskeletons of Ichthyosaurs from the Upper Lias of Holzmaden, in\r\nWürtemberg, and elsewhere, are found with the skeletons of one or more\r\nmuch smaller individuals enclosed partly or entirely within the cavity\r\nof the ribs [a specimen is figured]. Of such skeletons there are four\r\nin the museum at Stuttgart, two in that of Tübingen, one at Munich,\r\nand others in Gent and Paris. Of these, two in Stuttgart, as well as\r\nthe two in Tübingen, contain but a single young skeleton, while one of\r\nthose at Stuttgart has four, the Munich specimen five, and the\r\nremaining Stuttgart example upwards of seven young. Some of these\r\nyoung and, presumably, foetal Ichthyosaurs have the head turned\r\ntowards the tail of the parent, while in others it is directed the\r\nother way. That these young have not been swallowed by the larger\r\nindividuals within whose ribs they are found is pretty evident from\r\nseveral considerations. In the first place, their skeletons are always\r\nperfect. Then they never exceed one particular size, and always belong\r\nto the same species as the parent. Moreover, it would appear to be a\r\nphysical impossibility for one Ichthyosaur of the size of the\r\nStuttgart specimen to have had seven smaller ones of such dimensions\r\nin its stomach at one and the same time. We may accordingly take it\r\nfor granted that these imprisoned skeletons were those of foetuses. It\r\nis, however, very remarkable, that, so far as we are aware, all the\r\nskeletons with foetuses belong to one single species; thus suggesting\r\nthat this particular species was alone viviparous.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that further discoveries will be made, such as may\r\nfinally settle this question. One would have expected that in some\r\ncases the young ones, if foetal, would be imperfectly developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Æpyornis. Vid.

It\r\n     is so written as to be understanded of plain people, and is\r\n     illustrated by some very good woodcuts and\r\n     diagrams.\"--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n     \"This most interesting book.\"--_Spectator._\r\n\r\n     \"A delightfully written and thoroughly accurate popular work\r\n     on geology, well calculated to engage the interest of readers\r\n     in the fascinating study of the Stony Science.\"--_Science\r\n     Gossip._\r\n\r\n     \"In this work the Rev. H. N. Hutchinson produces a popular\r\n     account of geological history, and explains the principles\r\n     and methods by which that history has been read. He\r\n     endeavours to interpret the past by the light of the present,\r\n     first acquiring a knowledge, by direct observation and\r\n     self-instruction, of the chief operations now taking place on\r\n     the earth's surface, and then employing this knowledge to\r\n     ascertain the meaning of the record of stratified rocks. This\r\n     principle of 'uniformity' knocked the old teaching of\r\n     catastrophism on the head. The author is accurate in all his\r\n     details, yet his subject is touched into something not at all\r\n     unlike romance. The illustrations are good.\"--_National\r\n     Observer._\r\n\r\nLondon: EDWARD STANFORD, 26 & 27, Cockspur Street, S.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nSpelling and hyphenation was standardized. All OE and oe ligatures were\r\nconverted to \"Oe\" and \"oe\" respectively. The word Garuda has a macron\r\nover the u in the printed version.\r\n\r\nMissing endquote from the quoted passage, beginning in the last paragraph\r\non page 85, was confirmed by consulting Mantell's \"The Medals of Creation\"\r\n(p. 17).",
