I.D., PRINTERS,\r\n  LONDON AND TONBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Edition of this work appeared in 1854, a time in the history\r\nof the Microscope when the instrument, as an aid to original scientific\r\nresearch, may be said to have been in its infancy. Then certainly it\r\nwas seldom employed in the laboratory or the medical schools. Now,\r\nhowever, as I anticipated, it has asserted its proper position, and has\r\nat length become one of the most important auxiliaries to science, and\r\na direct incentive to original work, while it has doubtless exercised\r\nconsiderable influence over the student’s power of observation, and\r\nmaterially assisted in his studies, let his ultimate object and\r\npursuits be what they may.\r\n\r\nThe greater use made of the Microscope has likewise conferred benefits\r\nof untold value upon the arts and industries of the country, thereby\r\nadding to the national prosperity in ways as manifold as unique. The\r\nMicroscope has also proved of immense value in the promotion of the\r\nhealth of the community, and the art and science of healing, since\r\nthe theory of medicine has become a science, resting on the minute\r\nmicroscopical examination of animal tissues.\r\n\r\nThe work of research in the sister sciences and by other methods has,\r\nduring the last decade, received a corresponding impetus, while it\r\nhas undoubtedly tended towards elaboration and specialisation in all\r\ndepartments. In consequence, the progress of microscopical science\r\nhas become more dependent upon the specialist for gaining accurate\r\nknowledge and for certain important details seen to be branching out\r\nin many directions. There never was a time when the instrument was\r\nso constantly and generally resorted to and with so much confidence\r\nand advantage, as the present. It has shown itself equal to the task\r\nimposed--that of teaching the eye to see things that are new, and also,\r\nwhat is perhaps of more importance, to perceive things which had been\r\nentirely overlooked. The older defects, perhaps, arose from two causes;\r\nthe want of more careful training of the organ of vision, and the want\r\nof sufficient power and precision in the optical part of the Microscope\r\nitself. Both of these obstacles have been to a considerable extent\r\nremoved, and all educational systems are looked upon as incomplete\r\nwithout a knowledge of the Microscope.\r\n\r\nA step has already been taken in another direction, that of furnishing\r\nspecial forms of instruments, better adapted to the uses to which\r\nthey will hereafter be put, and purposely designed for chemical and\r\nanalytical processes, for petrological pursuits, the geometrical\r\nmeasurement of crystals, for special work in connection with\r\nmanufacturing industries, for the dairyman, and the farmer. For the\r\ndetection of adulterations--that of butter, for example--a newer form\r\nof instrument has been devised, namely, a “Butro-refractometer,” by the\r\nhelp of which any adulteration of this universal article of diet will\r\nat once be revealed. The form of instrument upon which the optician has\r\nexpended a greater amount of skill than perhaps on any other is the\r\nBacteriological Microscope, as may be inferred from the larger space\r\nI have devoted to this important adjunct, since by original research,\r\nthere can be no doubt a still greater future is in store for science\r\nin this special department of microscopy. But perfect success in this\r\ndirection remains very much with the practical optician, and the\r\nfurther improvements made in the optical part of the instrument, since\r\nit is admitted that the highest theoretical perfection has not yet been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace remark that every question solved is a step\r\ntowards new problems waiting solution. It is equally obvious that many\r\ndifficulties must be encountered by every author who uses his best\r\nendeavours to supply a standard volume or even a fairly comprehensive\r\ntext-book on the Microscope, one that will remain a sure guide for any\r\nlengthened period. Such a success I regard as scarcely possible. I\r\nmay, however, notice that my earlier work has met with a great amount\r\nof appreciation, and its utility acknowledged in the past by a demand\r\nalmost unprecedented, edition after edition being called for.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that my task has been accomplished with\r\nan earnest desire to assist in diffusing a love for an instrument which\r\nhas been my constant companion for upwards of sixty years.[1] Moreover,\r\nI have a firm conviction of the real utility of the Microscope in the\r\nwork of education, its practical value in many branches of science,\r\nart, and manufacturing industries. These are my chief reasons for\r\napplying myself once more to the task of revision, rewriting, and\r\nrearranging and bringing this book as far as possible into line with\r\nthe knowledge gained in chemical pathology and bacteriology.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the first part, my subjects have as far as\r\npossible been treated from a historical point of view. This method has\r\nenabled me to affix dates of introduction of special inventions and\r\nimprovements made in the instrument and its appliances. The enlargement\r\nof my pages has enabled me to devote more space to bacteriological\r\nprocesses, and by the further addition of plates and several hundred\r\nillustrations to more fully elucidate the subject matter of my text. In\r\nan Appendix I have introduced a selection of “Formulæ and Methods” of\r\nstaining, mounting, etc., also tables of the “Metrical System,” now in\r\ngeneral use in the laboratory; together with comparative thermometric\r\nvalues, all of which I trust may prove of service to the student.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing these few prefatory remarks to a close, a pleasing\r\nduty devolves upon me--that of tendering my thanks for cordial aid\r\nreceived from Professor Dr. EDGAR CROOKSHANK in dealing with his\r\nspecial subject, Bacteriology. From his valuable “Text-Book on\r\nBacteriology” I have extracted much useful matter. I am equally\r\nindebted to Professor MARSHALL WARD, F.R.S., Cambridge, for much\r\ninformation on “Economic Botany,” and the great advances made in the\r\nknowledge of the uses of plants, and the industrial value of bacteria\r\nin particular. My acknowledgments are also due to the Messrs. WARNE\r\nfor many illustrations placed at my disposal, and for useful facts\r\nderived from their “Royal Natural History.” It will, however, be seen\r\nthat the results of a large amount of independent observation have\r\nbeen consigned to my pages. As the references show, recourse has been\r\nhad to original sources for trustworthy, reliable information on many\r\nsubjects. These are constantly, almost daily, being added to, as is\r\nmade manifest by the numerous periodical publications of the day\r\ndevoted to this and kindred sciences; the foremost and most important\r\namong which is that almost exclusively given to microscopical science,\r\n“The Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society of London,” the perusal\r\nof which I commend to my readers.\r\n\r\nLONDON, JULY, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Author of this Publication entered upon his task with some\r\nhesitation and diffidence; but the reasons which influenced him to\r\nundertake it may be briefly told, and they at once explain his motives,\r\nand plead his justification, for the work which he now ventures to\r\nsubmit to the indulgent consideration of his readers.\r\n\r\nIt had been to him for some time a subject of regret that one of the\r\nmost useful and fascinating studies--that which belongs to the domain\r\nof microscopic observation--should be, if not wholly neglected, at\r\nbest but coldly and indifferently appreciated by the great mass of\r\nthe general public; and he formed a strong opinion that this apathy\r\nand inattention were mainly attributable to the want of some concise,\r\nyet sufficiently comprehensive, _popular_ account of the Microscope,\r\nboth as regards the management and manipulation of the instrument, and\r\nthe varied wonders and hidden realms of beauty that are disclosed and\r\ndeveloped by its aid. He saw around him valuable, erudite, and splendid\r\nvolumes, which, however, being chiefly designed for circulation amongst\r\na special class of readers, were necessarily published at a price\r\nthat renders them practically unattainable by the great bulk of the\r\npublic. They are careful and beautiful contributions to the objects\r\nof science, but they do not adequately bring the value and charm of\r\nmicroscopic studies home, so to speak, to the firesides of the people.\r\nDay after day, new and interesting discoveries, and amplifications of\r\ntruth already discerned, have been made, but they have been either\r\nsacrificed in serials, or, more usually, devoted to the pages of\r\nclass publications; and thus this most important and attractive study\r\nhas been, in a great measure, the province of the few only, who have\r\nderived from it a rich store of enlightenment and gratification: the\r\nmany not having, however, participated, to any great extent, in the\r\ninstruction and entertainment which always follow in the train of\r\nmicroscopical science.[2]\r\n\r\nThe manifold uses and advantages of the Microscope crowd upon us in\r\nsuch profusion, that we can only attempt to enumerate them in the\r\nbriefest and most rapid manner in these prefatory pages.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since this invaluable instrument was regarded in\r\nthe light of a costly toy; it is now the inseparable companion of the\r\nman of science. In the medical world, its utility and necessity are\r\nfully appreciated, even by those who formerly were slow to perceive\r\nits benefits; now, knowledge which could not be obtained even by the\r\nminutest dissection is acquired readily by its assistance, which\r\nhas become as essential to the anatomist and pathologist as are the\r\nscalpel and bedside observation. The smallest portion of a diseased\r\nstructure, placed under a Microscope, will tell more in one minute to\r\nthe experienced eye than could be ascertained by long examination of\r\nthe mass of disease in the ordinary method. Microscopic agency, in\r\nthus assisting the medical man, contributes much to the alleviation\r\nof those multiplied “ills which flesh is heir to.” So fully impressed\r\nwere the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons with the importance\r\nof the facts brought to light in a short space of time, that, in 1841,\r\nthey determined to establish a Professorship of Histology, and to form\r\na collection of preparations of the elementary tissues of both animals\r\nand vegetables, healthy and morbid, which should illustrate the value\r\nof microscopical investigations in physiology and medical science. From\r\nthat time, histological anatomy deservedly became an important branch\r\nof the education of the medical student.\r\n\r\nIn the study of Vegetable Physiology, the Microscope is an\r\nindispensable instrument; it enables the student to trace the earliest\r\nforms of vegetable life, and the functions of the different tissues in\r\nthe growth of plants. Valuable assistance is derived from its agency in\r\nthe detection of adulterations. In the examination of flour, an article\r\nof so much importance to all, the Microscope enables us to judge of the\r\nsize and shape of the starch-grains, their markings, their isolation\r\nand agglomeration, and thus to distinguish the starch-grains of one\r\nmeal from those of another. It detects these and other ingredients,\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, whether combined in atoms or aggregated\r\nin crystals, which adulterate our food, our drink, and our medicines.\r\nIt discloses the lurking poison in the minute crystallisations which\r\nits solutions precipitate. “It tells the murderer that the blood which\r\nstains him is that of his brother, and not of the other life which he\r\npretends to have taken; and as a witness against the criminal, it on\r\none occasion appealed to the very sand on which he trod at midnight.”\r\n\r\nThe zoologist finds in the Microscope a necessary coadjutor. To the\r\ngeologist it reveals, among a multiplicity of other facts, “that our\r\nlarge coal-beds are the ruins of a gigantic vegetation; and the vast\r\nlimestone rocks, which are so abundant on the earth’s surface, are the\r\ncatacombs of myriads of animal tribes, too minute to be perceived by\r\nthe unaided vision.”\r\n\r\nBy “conducting the eye to the confines of the visible form,” the\r\nMicroscope proves an effective auxiliary in defining the geometric\r\nproperties of bodies. Its influence as an instrument of research upon\r\nthe structure of bodies has been compared to that of the galvanic\r\nbattery, in the hands of Davy, upon Chemistry. It detects the smallest\r\nstructural difference, heretofore inappreciable, and, as an ally of\r\nChemistry, enables us to discover the very small changes of form and\r\ncolour effected by test-fluids upon solids; and dissects for us, so\r\nto speak, the most multiplex compounds. It opens out to the mind an\r\nextended and vast tract, opulent in wonders, rich in beauties, and\r\nboundless in extent.\r\n\r\nThe Microscope not only assists studies, and develops objects\r\nof profound interest, but also opens up innumerable sources of\r\nentertainment and amusement, in the ordinary conventional acceptation\r\nof these terms; disclosing to us peculiarities and attractions in\r\nabundance; impressing us with the wonderful and beautifully skilful\r\nadaptation of all parts of creation, and filling our minds with\r\nadditional reverence and admiration for the beneficent and Almighty\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nThe Author will conclude these prefatory observations with a few\r\nwords in explanation of his arrangements, by way of dealing with the\r\ninstrument and development of his subject. He has sought, in the volume\r\nthat he now lays before the public, to point out and elucidate at once\r\nin a practical manner and in a popular style, the vast fund of utility\r\nand amusement which the Microscope affords, and has endeavoured to\r\ntouch upon most of the interesting subjects for microscopic observation\r\nas fully as the restrictions of a limited space, and the nature of the\r\nsuccinct summary, would permit. To have dwelt upon each in complete\r\ndetail would have necessitated the issue of many expensive volumes--and\r\nthis would have entirely frustrated the aim which the writer had in\r\nview; he has, therefore, contented himself with the humble, but, he\r\ntrusts, not useless, task of setting up a finger-post, so to say, to\r\ndirect the inquirer into the wider road. In the section of the work\r\ndevoted to the minuter portion of creation, he has ventured to dwell\r\nsomewhat longer, in the belief that that department is more especially\r\nthe province of the microscopist. He has arranged his topics under\r\nspecial headings, and in separate chapters, for the sake of perspicuity\r\nand precision; and has brought the ever-welcome aid of illustration to\r\nconvey his explanatory remarks more vividly to the minds of his readers.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is the Author’s hope that, by the instrumentality of this\r\nvolume, he may possibly assist in bringing the Microscope, and its\r\nvaluable and delightful studies, before the general public in a more\r\nfamiliar, compendious, and economical form than he found it at the\r\nperiod of its publication, so that, in these days of a diffused taste\r\nfor reading and the spread of cheap publications, he may thus supply\r\nfurther exercise for the intellectual faculties; contribute to the\r\nadditional amusement and instruction of the family circle, and aid the\r\nstudent of nature in investigating the wonderful and exquisite works of\r\nthe Almighty. If it shall be the good fortune for this work, which is\r\nnow confided with great diffidence to the consideration of the public,\r\nto succeed, in however slight a degree, in furthering this design,\r\nthe Author will feel fully repaid for the amount of time and labour\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _May_, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  EARLY HISTORY OF THE MICROSCOPE                                    1\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  LIGHT--ITS PROPAGATION--REFRACTION--SPHERICAL AND CHROMATIC\r\n  ABERRATION--HUMAN EYE--FORMATION OF IMAGES--VISUAL ANGLE--ABBÉ’S\r\n  THEORY OF MICROSCOPIC VISION--DEFINITION OF APERTURE--NUMERICAL\r\n  APERTURE--ABBÉ’S APERTOMETER--STEREOSCOPIC\r\n  BINOCULAR VISION                                                  12\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  SIMPLE AND COMPOUND MICROSCOPES--EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN\r\n  ACHROMATIC MICROSCOPE--IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MODERN MICROSCOPE:\r\n  THE ROSS-JACKSON, POWELL AND LEALAND, BECK’S, BAKER’S,\r\n  PILLISCHER, ZEISS, LEITZ, WATSON’S, VAN HEURCK’S EDINBURGH\r\n  STUDENTS’, SWIFT’S, AND BACTERIOLOGICAL                           72\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  APPLIED OPTICS--EYE-PIECES--ACHROMATIC OBJECTIVES AND\r\n  CONDENSERS--MAGNIFYING POWER OF EYE-PIECES AND OBJECTIVES--METHOD\r\n  OF EMPLOYING THE CONDENSER--ITS ILLUMINATION MIRROR--ACCESSORIES\r\n  OF THE MICROSCOPE--FINDERS--MICROMETERS--CAMERA-LUCIDA--MICROSCOPE\r\n  IN POSITION FOR DRAWING--ABBÉ’S\r\n  TEST-PLATE--MICRO-PHOTOGRAPHY--POLARISATION OF LIGHT--THE\r\n  MICRO-SPECTROSCOPE                                               139\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY--MANIPULATION--MODE OF EMPLOYING THE\r\n  MICROSCOPE--WORKING ACCESSORIES--METHODS OF PREPARING,\r\n  HARDENING, STAINING, AND SECTION CUTTING--CUTTING HARD\r\n  STRUCTURES--INJECTING APPARATUS, MATERIAL, ETC., EMPLOYED IN\r\n  BACTERIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS--WARM CHAMBERS AND INCUBATORS--PREPARING,\r\n  MOUNTING, CEMENTING, AND COLLECTING\r\n  OBJECTS                                                          258\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  MICROSCOPIC FORMS OF LIFE--THALLOPHYTES, PTERIDOPHYTA,\r\n  PHANEROGAMÆ--STRUCTURE   AND PROPERTIES OF THE CELL--PATHOGENIC\r\n  FUNGI AND MOULDS--PARASITIC DISEASES OF PLANTS, MAN, AND\r\n  ANIMALS--INDUSTRIAL USES OF FUNGI AND SACCHAROMYCETES--DESMIDIACEÆ\r\n  AND DIATOMACEÆ--LICHENS, MOSSES, FERNS,\r\n  FLOWERING PLANTS                                                 353\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  SUB-KINGDOM PROTOZOA--RHIZOPODA--GROMIA AND\r\n      FORAMINIFERA--INFUSORIA--CILIATA--ROTIFERA--PORIFERA--SPONGES  478\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  ZOOPHYTES--CŒLENTERATA--MEDUSÆ--CORALS--HYDROZOA--MOLLUSCA--\r\n  ANNULOSA--WORMS--ENTOZOA--ANNELIDA--CRUSTACEA\r\n                                                                   515\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  ARTHROPODA--INSECTA--ARACHNIDA--ACARINA--IXODIDÆ--MITES AND\r\n  TICKS                                                            583\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  VERTEBRATA--INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STRUCTURES                     633\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE MINERAL AND GEOLOGICAL KINGDOMS                              670\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  DR.

Its origin, so far as yet can be traced back, seems\r\nto be of a doubtful nature. It is tolerably certain the ancients had\r\nlittle or no conception of the magnifying power of lenses; this may be\r\nsurmised from their writings. The elder Pliny incidentally states that\r\nthe physicians of his day cauterised by means of “a globe of crystal.”\r\nThe learned Greek physician, Galen, however, demonstrates conclusively\r\nthat in the first and second centuries of our era the use of magnifying\r\nlenses was quite unknown either to Greek or Roman. Moreover, the\r\nwritings of Archimedes, Ptolemy, and other learned men, show that,\r\nalthough they had some idea of the action of refraction at plane\r\nsurfaces, as of water, yet of the refraction at curved surfaces they\r\nhad formed no conception. Indeed, they refer quite indiscriminately to\r\nthe spherical form, or the disc, or the plane surface of the water,\r\nbut not one of them speaks of the lenticular form, or the curvature of\r\ntheir surfaces.\r\n\r\nAs to the more powerful optical instruments, the telescope and\r\nmicroscope, although it would appear that Alhazen in the 10th or 11th\r\ncentury, Roger Bacon in the 13th, and Fracastoro and Baptist Porta in\r\nthe 16th, had formed some idea that lenses might be made and combined\r\nso that distant objects might be seen clearer, or near ones magnified\r\nbeyond the power of normal vision; yet we hold with Kepler, that no\r\ninstrument analogous to our telescope was known before the early part\r\nof the 17th century.\r\n\r\nThe combination of lenses associated with the name of Galileo, was,\r\nhe tells us, of Dutch origin, and of a date anterior to that of his\r\ntelescope, constructed by him in 1609; and this would appear to be the\r\nprobable origin of the microscope consisting of a combination of a\r\nconvex object lens with a concave eye lens.[3]\r\n\r\nIt now appears almost impossible to assign the exact date of the\r\nfirst production of the microscope (as distinguished from the simple\r\nmagnifying lens), but those who have made a special investigation,\r\nagree that it must have been invented between 1590 and 1609, and that\r\neither of the three spectacle-makers of Middelburg, Holland, Hans\r\nJanssen, his son Zacharias Janssen, and Hans Lippershey, may have been\r\nthe inventor, the probabilities being in favour of the Janssens, and\r\nthere the question must remain.\r\n\r\nThe history of the modern microscope, like that of nations and arts,\r\nhas had its brilliant periods, in which it shone with uncommon\r\nsplendour, and was cultivated with extraordinary ardour; these periods\r\nhave been succeeded by intervals marked with no discovery, and in which\r\nthe science seemed to fade away, or at least to lie dormant, till some\r\nfavourable circumstance--the discovery of a new object, or some new\r\nimprovement in the instruments of observation--awakened the attention\r\nof the curious, and reanimated the spirit of research. Thus, soon after\r\nthe invention of the microscope, the field it presented to observation\r\nwas cultivated by men of the first rank in science, and who enriched\r\nalmost every branch of natural history by the discoveries made by means\r\nof this instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Modern Microscope.\r\n\r\nTo the celebrated Dr. Hooke belongs the honour of publishing an account\r\nof the compound instrument in 1665 in his “Micrographia.” His first\r\nclaim, however, is founded on the application of a lamp adjustable on a\r\npillar, together with a glass globe of water and a deep plano-convex\r\ncondensing lens. By means of this arrangement, he says, “The light can\r\nbe directed more directly on the object under examination.” In the\r\nfurther description given of his microscope, he explains: “It has four\r\ndraw-tubes for lengthening the body, and a third lens to the optical\r\ncombination.” This, it would appear, was only brought into use when\r\nhe wished to see the whole object at once: “The middle-glass lens,\r\nconveying a very great company of radiating pencils (of light) which\r\nwould stray away; but when I had occasion to examine the small parts of\r\na body, I took out the middle glass and made use of one eye-glass with\r\nthe object-glass.”\r\n\r\nFrom Hooke’s description I gather that he also introduced the\r\nball-and-socket movement into the construction of the body of his\r\ninstrument. This has found many imitators since his day; some of\r\nthem have gone so far as to claim the invention as one quite new.\r\nFor small accessories, where the leverage need not be considered,\r\nthe ball-and-socket has proved convenient enough; but not, however,\r\nif applied to the stand of the microscope. Hooke, in his early work,\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction with the English-made lenses he had in use.\r\nHe complains of the “apertures of the object-glasses, which are so\r\nsmall that very few rays are admitted; none will admit a sufficient\r\nnumber of rays to magnifie the object beyond a determinate bigness.”\r\nSo we may take it that he thus early discovered the great importance\r\nof an increase in the aperture of his microscope. Other improvements\r\nof importance were made, and he was the first to describe a useful\r\nmethod of estimating the magnifying power of his lenses, and the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing between a prominence and a depression in\r\nthe object under investigation, which he was made more fully aware\r\nof when preparing drawings for the illustration of his “Micrographia\r\nIllustrata”; this would be in 1664, if not earlier. His book created\r\nno little sensation on its first appearance, and it soon became\r\nscarce. Hooke (says Mr. Mayall) “must undoubtedly be credited with the\r\nfirst suggestion of immersion lenses.” Nevertheless, in his “Lectures\r\nand Collections,” published in 1676, he appears to be no longer\r\nenthusiastic over his double microscope, and once more he reverts to\r\nthe simpler instrument of his earlier days. Whether this change of\r\nopinion was due to the publication of Leeuwenhoek’s observations with\r\nhis simple microscopes it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1673 Leeuwenhoek communicated some important discoveries\r\nmade by a simple microscope of his own construction to the Royal\r\nSociety; he, however, gave no particulars of the construction of the\r\ninstrument. Dr. Adams, writing to his friend (Sir) Hans Sloane, says:\r\n“They appear to be spherules lodged between two plates of gold or\r\nbrass, in a hole whose diameter appears to be no bigger than that of a\r\nsmall pin’s head.” At his death he bequeathed to the Royal Society a\r\ncabinet containing twenty-six of these microscopes; the cabinet and the\r\nmicroscopes long ago disappeared, but not before they were carefully\r\nexamined and described by Mr. Henry Baker, F.R.S. In his report to the\r\nRoyal Society, he says: “They consisted of a series of convex-lenses,\r\nranging in power from 1·20 to 1·5, and magnifying from 160 to 40\r\ndiameters.” This must now be regarded as an eventful period in the\r\nhistory of the microscope, since Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries created\r\na great sensation throughout Europe. And all further improvements\r\nin compound instruments appear to have been laid aside for some\r\nconsiderable period in consequence: and the pocket instrument of\r\nWilson, together with that of his scroll standard (seen on the cover of\r\nthis book), and which was one of the first simple microscopes with a\r\nmirror mounted on the base in a line with the optic axis.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries once more made, and at a much later period (1738), by\r\nDr. Nathaniel Lieberkuhn with his simple microscopes, and by means of\r\nwhich he discovered the minute structure of the mucous membrane of the\r\nalimentary canal, and which alone would have immortalised his name\r\nhad we not preserved in use to this day an important adjunct of every\r\nmodern instrument, the Lieberkuhn reflector.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, there is\r\na small cabinet of two drawers, containing a set of twelve of his\r\nsimple microscopes, each being provided with an original injection. The\r\nform of the instrument is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. _a b_ represents a\r\npiece of brass tubing about an inch long and an inch in diameter and\r\nprovided with a cap at each extremity. The one at _a_ carries a small\r\ndouble-convex lens of half an inch focal length; while at _b_ there is\r\nfixed a condensing lens three-quarters of an inch in diameter. In Fig.\r\n2 the instrument is seen in section, and explains itself. It is held by\r\nthe handle in such a position that the rays of light, from a lamp or\r\na white cloud, may fall on the condenser _b_, and concentrate on the\r\nspeculum _l_. This again further condenses the rays on the disc _c_,\r\nwhere the object is held, and its adjustment made by the milled-head\r\nscrew _d_, so as to bring it within the focus of the lens _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nFrom this digression I pass on to the evolution of the compound\r\nmicroscope. The earliest workable form known was that designed by\r\nEustachio Divini, who brought it to the notice of the Royal Society\r\nin 1668. It consisted of two plano-convex lenses, combined with their\r\nconvex surfaces retained in apposition. His idea was subsequently\r\nimproved upon by a London optician. Not long afterwards, Philip\r\nBonnani published an account of his improved compound microscope; and\r\nwe are certainly indebted to him for two or more forms of the movable\r\nhorizontal microscopes, and for the compound condenser fitted with\r\nfocussing gear for illuminating transparent objects by transmitted\r\nlight. I must, however, pass by the many changes made in the structure\r\nand form of the instrument by the celebrated Dr. Culpeper, Scarlet,\r\nCuff, and many other inventors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Lieberkuhn’s Microscope.]\r\n\r\n=Benjamin Martin’s Microscope.=--Benjamin Martin, about 1742, was\r\nbusily engaged in making improvements in the microscope, and I may\r\nsay he was certainly the first to provide accurate results for\r\ndetermining the exact magnifying power of any object-lens, so that\r\nthe observer might state the exact amplification in a certain number\r\nof diameters. He devised numerous improvements in the mechanism and\r\noptical arrangements of the instrument; the rack and pinion focussing\r\nadjustments; the inclining movements to the pillar carrying the stage;\r\nand the rectangular mechanical motions to the stage itself. He was\r\nfamiliar with the principles of achromatism, since it appears he\r\nproduced an achromatic objective about 1759, and he is said to have\r\nsent an achromatic objective to the Royal Society about that date. But\r\nan ingeniously constructed microscope by Martin found its way to George\r\nthe Third, the grandfather of our Queen, and afterwards came into the\r\npossession of the late Professor John Quekett, of the Royal College\r\nof Surgeons, who presented it to the Royal Microscopical Society of\r\nLondon. This microscope will ever associate Martin’s name with the\r\nearliest and best form of the instrument, even should he not receive\r\nfull recognition as the inventor of the _achromatic microscope_. On\r\nthis account I introduce a carefully made drawing of so singularly\r\nperfect a form of the early English microscope to the notice of my\r\nreaders. (Fig. 3.) The description given of it by the late Professor\r\nQuekett is as follows:--“It stands about two feet in height, and is\r\nsupported on a tripod base, A; the central part of the stem, B, is of\r\ntriangular figure, having a rack at the back, upon which the stage,\r\nO, and frame, D, supporting the mirror, E, are capable of being moved\r\nup or down. The compound body, F, is three inches in diameter; it is\r\ncomposed of two tubes, the inner of which contains the eye-piece, and\r\ncan be raised or depressed by rack and pinion, so as to increase or\r\ndiminish the magnifying power. At the base of the triangular bar is a\r\ncradle joint, G, by which the instrument can be inclined by turning\r\nthe screw-head, H (connected with an endless screw acting upon a\r\nworm-wheel). The arm, I, supporting the compound body, is supplied with\r\na rack and pinion, K, by which it can be moved backwards and forwards,\r\nand a joint is placed below it, upon which the body can be turned into\r\nthe horizontal position; another bar, carrying a stage and mirror, can\r\nbe attached by a screw, L N, so as to convert it into a horizontal\r\nmicroscope. The stage, O, is provided with all the usual apparatus for\r\nclamping objects, and a condenser can be applied to its under surface;\r\nthe stage itself may be removed, the arm, P, supporting it, turned\r\nround on the pivot, C, and another stage of exquisite workmanship\r\nplaced in its stead, the under surface of which is shown at Q.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Martin’s Universal Microscope. 1782.]\r\n\r\nThis stage is strictly a micrometer one, having rectangular movements\r\nand a fine adjustment, the movements being accomplished by the\r\nfine-threaded screws, the milled heads of which are graduated. The\r\nmirror, E, is a double one, and can be raised or depressed by rack and\r\npinion; it is also capable of removal, and an apparatus for holding\r\nlarge opaque objects, such as minerals, can be substituted for it.\r\nThe accessory instruments are very numerous, and amongst the more\r\nremarkable may be mentioned a tube, M, containing a speculum, which can\r\ntake the place of the tube, R, and so form a reflecting microscope.\r\nThe apparatus for holding animalcules or other live objects, which is\r\nrepresented at S, as well as a plate of glass six inches in diameter,\r\nwith four concave wells ground in it, can be applied to the stage, so\r\nthat each well may be brought in succession under the magnifying power.\r\nThe lenses belonging to this microscope are twenty-four in number;\r\nthey vary in focal length from four inches to one-tenth of an inch;\r\nten of them are supplied with Lieberkuhns. A small arm, capable of\r\ncarrying single lenses, can be supplied at T, and when turned over,\r\nthe stage of the instrument becomes a single microscope; there are\r\nfour lenses suitable for this purpose, their focal length varying\r\nfrom one-tenth to one-fortieth of an inch. The performance of all the\r\nlenses is excellent, and no pains appear to have been spared in their\r\nconstruction. There are numerous other pieces of accessory apparatus,\r\nall remarkable for the beauty of their workmanship.[4]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the movements described by Quekett, the body-tube with\r\nits support can be moved in an arc concentrically with the axis of the\r\ntriangular pillar, on the top of which it is fitted with a worm-wheel\r\nand endless-screw mechanism, actuated by the screw-head, T, below.\r\nIt must therefore be admitted that Martin led the way far beyond his\r\ncontemporaries, both in the design and the evolution of the microscope.\r\nFurthermore, in his “New Elements of Optics,” 1759, he dealt with\r\nthe principle of achromatism, by the construction of an achromatic\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat later period there lived in London a philosophical\r\ninstrument maker of some repute, George Adams, who published in 1746\r\na quarto book, entitled “Micrographia Illustrata, or the Knowledge of\r\nthe Microscope Explained.” This work fairly well describes “the nature,\r\nuses, and magnifying powers of microscopes in general, together with\r\nfull directions how to prepare, apply, examine, and preserve minute\r\nobjects.” Adams’ book was the first of the kind published in this\r\ncountry, and it contributed in no small degree to the advancement of\r\nmicroscopical science. Adams writes: “We owe the construction of the\r\nvariable microscope to the ingenuity and generosity of a noble person.\r\nThe apparatus belonging to it is more convenient, more certain, and\r\nmore extensive than that of any other at present extant; consequently,\r\nthe advantage and pleasure attending the observations in viewing\r\nobjects through it must be as extensive in proportion.” This is\r\nbelieved to apply to Martin’s several microscopes, and that especially\r\nconstructed for the king, afterwards improved upon by Adams. Another\r\nearly form of microscope, Wilson Simple Scroll (1746), stamped on the\r\ncover of this book, and has thus become familiar to microscopists, was\r\nalso made by Adams.\r\n\r\nWe now closely approach a period fertile in the improvement of the\r\nmicroscope, and in the discoveries made by its agency. The chief of\r\nthose among the honoured names of the time we find Trembley, Ellis,\r\nBaker, Adams, Hill, Swammerdam, Lyonet, Needham, and a few others.\r\nAdams somewhat sarcastically observes “that every optician exercises\r\nhis talents in improving (as he calls it) the microscope, in other\r\nwords, in varying its construction and rendering it different in\r\nform from that sold by his neighbour; or at the best rendering it\r\nmore complex and troublesome to manage.” There were no doubt good\r\nreasons for these and other strictures upon inventors as well as\r\nmakers of microscopes, even in the Adams’ day. In the year 1787 the\r\n“Microscopical Essays” of his son were published, in which he described\r\nall the instruments in use up to that period.\r\n\r\nLooking back, and taking a general survey of the work of nearly two\r\ncenturies in the history of the microscope, it cannot be said that\r\neither in its optical or mechanical construction any great amount of\r\nprogress was made. This in part may have arisen from the fact that\r\nno pressing need was felt for either delicate focussing or higher\r\nmagnification. At all events, it was not until the application of\r\nachromatism to the instrument that new life was infused into its use,\r\nand a great impetus was given to its development, both optically and\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1823 a strong desire became manifest for improved forms of\r\nthe instrument, in France by M. Selligue, by Frauenhofer in Munich,\r\nby Amici in Modena, by M. Chevalier in Paris, and by Dr. Goring, Mr.\r\nPritchard, and Mr. Tully in London. The result was that in 1824 a new\r\nform of achromatic object-glass was constructed of nine-tenths of\r\nan inch focal length, composed of three lenses, and transmitting a\r\npencil of eighteen degrees; and which, as regards accurate correction\r\nthroughout the field, was for some years regarded as perfect.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster was the first to suggest the great importance\r\nof introducing materials of a more highly refracting nature into\r\nthe construction of lenses. He wrote: “There can be no essential\r\nimprovement expected in the microscope unless from the discovery\r\nof some transparent substance which, like the diamond, combines a\r\nhigh refractive with a low dispersive power.” Having experienced the\r\ngreatest difficulty in getting a small diamond cut into a prism in\r\nLondon, he did not conceive it practicable to grind, polish, and form\r\nit into a lens.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchard, however, was led to make the experiment, and on the\r\n1st of December, 1824, “he had the pleasure of first looking through\r\na diamond microscope.” Dr. Goring also tried its performance on\r\nvarious objects, both as a single microscope and as an objective of\r\na compound instrument, and satisfied himself of its superiority over\r\nother kinds of lenses. But here Mr. Pritchard’s labours did not end. He\r\nsubsequently found that the diamond used had many flaws in it, which\r\nled him to abandon the idea of finishing it. Having been prevented\r\nfrom resuming his operations on this refractory material for a time\r\nhe made a third attempt, and met with another unexpected defect; he\r\nfound that some lenses, unlike the first, gave a double or triple image\r\ninstead of a single one, in consequence of some of their parts being\r\neither harder or softer than others. These defects were found to be\r\ndue to polarisation. Mr. Pritchard having learned how to decide whether\r\na diamond is fit for a magnifier or not, subsequently succeeded in\r\nmaking two planoconvex lenses of adamant; these proved to be perfect\r\nfor microscopic purposes. “One of these, of one-twentieth of an inch\r\nin focal length, is now in the possession of his Grace the Duke of\r\nBuckingham; the other, of one-thirtieth of an inch focus, is in his own\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\n“In consequence of the high refracting power of a diamond lens over\r\na glass lens, the former material may be at least one-third as thin\r\nas that of the latter, and if the focal length of both be equal, say,\r\none-eightieth of an inch, the magnifying power of the diamond lens\r\nwill be 2,133 diameters, whereas that of glass will be only 800.” At\r\na date (1812) before Brewster proposed diamond lenses he demonstrated\r\na simple method of rendering both single and compound microscopes\r\nachromatic. “Starting,” he says, “with the principle that all objects,\r\nhowever delicate, are best seen when immersed in fluid, he placed\r\nan object on a slip of glass, and put above a drop of oil, having a\r\ngreater dispersive power than the single concave lens, which formed the\r\nobject-glass of the microscope. The lens was then made to touch the\r\nfluid, so that the surface of the fluid was formed into a concave lens,\r\nand if the radius of the outward surface was such as to correct the\r\ndispersion, we should have a perfect achromatic microscope.” Here we\r\nhave the immersion system foreshadowed. Shortly after these experiments\r\nof Brewster’s were in progress, Dr. Goring is said to have discovered\r\nthat the structure of certain bodies could be readily seen in some\r\nmicroscopes and not in others. These bodies he named test objects.\r\nHe then examined these tests with the achromatic combinations of the\r\nTullys, and was led to the discovery that “the penetrating power of the\r\nmicroscope depends upon its angle of aperture.”\r\n\r\n“While these practical investigations were in progress,” writes Andrew\r\nRoss, “the subject of achromatism engaged the attention of some of\r\nthe most profound mathematicians in England, Sir John Herschel, and\r\nProfessors Airy and Barlow. Mr. Coddington and others contributed\r\nlargely to the theoretical examination of the subject; and although the\r\nresults of their labours were not applicable to the microscope, they\r\nessentially promoted its improvement.”\r\n\r\nAbout this period (1812) Professor Amici, of Modena, was\r\nexperimentally engaged in the improvement of the achromatic\r\nobject-glass, and he invented a reflecting microscope superior to\r\nthose of Newton, Baker, or Smith, made as early as 1738, and long ago\r\nabandoned. In 1815 Amici made further experiments, and introduced the\r\nimmersion system; while Frauenhofer, of Munich, about the same time\r\nconstructed object-glasses for the microscope of a single achromatic\r\nlens, in which the two glasses, although placed in juxtaposition, were\r\nnot cemented together.\r\n\r\nDolland, it has been said, introduced achromatic lenses; but although\r\nhe constructed many achromatic telescopes, he did not apply the\r\nsame principle to microscopes, and those which he sold were only\r\nmodifications of the compound microscope of Cuff.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston employed a new form of combination in a microscope\r\nconstructed for his own use, and by which “he was able to see\r\ndistinctly the finest markings upon the scales of the _Lepisma_ and\r\n_Podura_, and upon those of the gnat’s wing.” His doublet is still\r\nemployed, and to which I shall refer under “Simple Microscopes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3_a_.--Sir David Brewster’s Microscope, of the\r\nearly part of the century, recently presented to the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nElementary Optics.\r\n\r\n    Value of Inductive Science--Light: Its Propagation, Refraction,\r\n    Reflection--Spherical and Chromatic Aberrations--Human Eye,\r\n    formation of Images of External Objects in--Visual Angle\r\n    increased--Abbe’s Theory of Microscopic Vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advances made in physics and mechanics during the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies fairly opened the way to the attainment of greater perfection\r\nin all optical instruments. This has been particularly exemplified\r\nwith reference to the invention of the microscope, as briefly sketched\r\nout in the previous chapter. Indeed, in the first half of the present\r\ncentury the microscope can scarcely be said to have held a position\r\nof importance among the scientific instruments in frequent use. Since\r\nthen, however, the zoologist and botanist by its aid have laid bare\r\nthe intimate structure of plants and animals, and thereby have opened\r\nup a vast kingdom of minute forms of life previously undreamt of; and\r\nin connection with chemistry a new science has been founded, that of\r\nbacteriology.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it will be of importance to the student of microscopy\r\nto begin at the beginning, and it will be my endeavour to introduce to\r\nhis notice such facts in physical optics as are closely associated with\r\nthe formation of images, and, so to speak, systematise such stepping\r\nstones for work hereafter to be accomplished. Elementary principles\r\nonly will be adduced, and without attempting to involve my readers\r\nin intricate mathematical problems, and which for the most part are\r\nunnecessary for the attainment of the object in view. I therefore\r\npass at once to the consideration of the propagation of light through\r\ncertain bodies.\r\n\r\nThe microscope, whether simple or compound, depends for its magnifying\r\npower on the influence exerted by lenses in altering the course of the\r\nrays of light passing through them being REFRACTED. _Refraction_ takes\r\nplace in accordance with two well-known laws of optics. When a ray of\r\nlight passes from one transparent medium to another it undergoes a\r\nchange of direction at the surface of separation, so that its course\r\nin the second medium makes an angle with its course in the first. This\r\nchange of direction is a resultant of refraction. The broken appearance\r\npresented by a stick partly immersed in water, and viewed in an oblique\r\nposition, is an illustration of the law of refraction. Liquids have a\r\ngreater refractive power than air or gases. As a rule, with some few\r\nexceptions, the denser of the two substances has the greater refractive\r\npower; hence it is customary in enumerating some of the laws of optics\r\nto speak of the denser medium and the rarer medium. The more correct\r\ndesignation would be the more refractive and the less refractive.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Law of Refraction.]\r\n\r\nLet R I (Fig. 4) be a ray incident at I on the surface of separation\r\nof two media, and let I S′ be the course of the ray after refraction.\r\nThen the angles which R I and I S make with the normal are the _angle\r\nof incidence_ and the _angle of refraction_ respectively, and the\r\nfirst law of refraction is that these angles lie in the same plane,\r\nor the _plane of refraction_ is the same as the _plane of incidence_.\r\nThe law which connects the magnitudes of these angles, and which was\r\ndiscovered by Snell, a Dutch philosopher, can only be stated either\r\nby reference to a geometrical construction, or by using the language\r\nof trigonometry. Describe a circle about the point of incidence, I as\r\na centre, and drop perpendiculars from the points where it cuts the\r\nrays on the normal. The law is that these perpendiculars, R′ P′, S′ P,\r\nwill have a constant ratio, or the sines _of the angles of incidence\r\nand refraction are in a constant ratio_; that is, so long as the media\r\nthrough which the ray first passes, and by which it is afterwards\r\nrefracted, remain the same, and the light also of the same kind, then\r\nit is referred to as the law of sines.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndices of Refraction.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the\r\nangle of refraction, when a ray passes from one medium to another is\r\ntermed the relative index of refraction. When a ray passes from vacuum\r\ninto any medium, this ratio is always greater than unity, and is called\r\nthe _absolute index of refraction_, or simply the index of refraction\r\nfor the medium in question.\r\n\r\nThe absolute index of air is so small that it may be neglected in\r\ncomparison with those of solids and liquids; but strictly speaking, the\r\nrelative index for a ray passing from air into a given substance must\r\nbe multiplied by the absolute index of the air, in order to obtain the\r\ntrue index of refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Vision through a Glass Plate.]\r\n\r\n=Critical Angle.=--It will be seen from the law of sines that, when\r\nthe incident ray is in the less refractive of the two media, to\r\nevery possible angle of incidence there is a corresponding angle of\r\nrefraction. The angle referred to is termed the _critical angle_, and\r\nis readily computed if the relative index of refraction be given. When\r\nthe media are air and water, this angle is about 48° 30′. For air and\r\nordinary kinds of glass its value varies from 38° to 41°.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of total reflection may be observed in several familiar\r\ninstances. For example, if a glass of water, with a spoon in it, is\r\nheld above the level of the eye, the under side of the surface is\r\nseen to shine like a mirror, and the lower part of the spoon is seen\r\nreflected in it. Effects of the same kind are observed when a ray\r\nof sunlight passes into an aquarium--on the other hand rays falling\r\nnormally on a uniform transparent plate of glass with parallel faces\r\nkeep their course; but objects viewed obliquely through the same\r\nare displaced from their true position. Let S (Fig. 5) be a luminous\r\npoint which sends light to an eye not directly opposite to it, on the\r\nother side of a parallel plate. The emergent rays which enter the\r\neye are parallel to the incident rays; but as they have undergone\r\nlateral displacement, their point of concourse is changed from S to\r\nS′, and this is accordingly the image of S. The rays in such a case\r\nwhich compose the pencil that enters the eye will not exactly meet in\r\nany one point; there will be two focal lines, just as in the case of\r\nspherical mirrors. The displacement produced, as seen in the figure\r\nreferred to above, increases with the thickness of the plate, its index\r\nof refraction, and the obliquity of incidence. This furnishes one of\r\nthe simplest means of measuring the index of refraction of a glass\r\nsubstance, and is thus employed in Pichot’s refractometer (“Deschanel”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Refraction through a Prism.]\r\n\r\n=Refraction through a Prism.=--A prism is a portion of a refracting\r\nmedium bounded by two plane surfaces, inclined at a definite angle\r\nto one another. The two plane surfaces are termed the _faces_ of the\r\nprism, and their inclination to one another is the refracting angle\r\nof the prism. A prism preserves the property of bending rays of light\r\nfrom their original course by refraction. A cylinder may be regarded\r\nas the limit of a prism whose sides increase in number and diminish in\r\nsize indefinitely: it may also be regarded as a pyramid whose apex is\r\nremoved to an indefinite distance.\r\n\r\nLet S I (Fig. 6) be an incident ray in the plane of the principal\r\nsection of the prism. If the external medium be air, or other substance\r\nof less refractive power than the prism, the ray on entering the same\r\nwill be bent nearer to the normal, taking such a course as I E, and on\r\nleaving the prism will be bent away from the normal, taking the course\r\nE B. The effect of these two refractions is, therefore, to turn the ray\r\naway from the edge (or refracting angle) of the prism. In practice,\r\nthe prism is usually so placed that I E, the path of the ray through\r\nthe prism, makes equal angles with the two faces at which refraction\r\noccurs. If the prism is turned very far from this position, the course\r\nof the ray may be altogether different from that represented in the\r\nfigure; it may enter at one face, be internally reflected at another,\r\nand come out at the third.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the minimum number of sides, _i.e._, the\r\nbounding faces, exclusive of the ends, which a prism can have is three.\r\nIn this form, it constitutes a most valuable instrument of research in\r\nphysical optics. A convex lens is practically merely a curved form of\r\ntwo prisms combined, their bases being brought into contact; on the\r\nother hand the concave lens is simply a reversal of the position of\r\nthe apices brought into contact, as shown in Fig. 11. Both convex and\r\nconcave lenses are therefore closely related to the prism.\r\n\r\n=Reflection.=--The laws that govern the change of direction which a ray\r\nof light experiences when it strikes upon the surfaces of separation\r\nof two media and is thrown back into the same medium from which it\r\napproached is as follows:--When the reflecting surface is plain the\r\ndirection of the reflected ray makes with the normal to the surface the\r\nsame angle which the incident ray makes with the same normal; or, as it\r\nis usually expressed, the angles of reflection and incidence are equal.\r\nWhen the surfaces are curved the same law holds good. In all cases of\r\nreflection the energy of the ray is diminished, so that reflection must\r\nalways be accompanied by absorption. The latter probably precedes the\r\nformer. Most bodies are visible by light reflected from their surfaces,\r\nbut before this takes place the light has undergone a modification,\r\nnamely, that which imparts colour peculiar to the bodies viewed. When\r\nlight impinges upon the surface of a denser medium part is reflected,\r\npart absorbed, and part refracted. But for a certain angle depending\r\nupon the refractive index of the refracting medium no refraction takes\r\nplace. This angle is termed the angle of total reflection, since all\r\nthe light which is not absorbed is wholly reflected.\r\n\r\nMultiple images are produced by a transparent parallel plate of\r\nglass. If the glass be silvered at the back, as it usually is in the\r\nmicroscope-mirror, the second image is brighter than the first, but as\r\nthe angle of incidence increases the first image gains upon the second;\r\nand if the luminous object be a lamp or candle, a number of images,\r\none behind the other, will be visible to an eye properly placed in\r\nfront. This is due to the fact that the reflecting power of a surface\r\nof glass increases with the angle of incidence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Conjugate Foci of Curved Surfaces.]\r\n\r\n=Concave Surfaces.=--Rays of light proceeding from any given point in\r\nfront of a concave spherical mirror, are reflected so as to meet in\r\nanother point, and the line joining the two points passes through the\r\ncentre of the sphere. The relation between them is or should be mutual,\r\nhence they are termed _conjugate foci_. By a _focus_ in general is\r\nmeant a point in which a number of rays of light meet, and the rays\r\nwhich thus meet, taken collectively, are termed _a pencil_. Fig. 7\r\nrepresents two pencils of rays whose foci, S s, are conjugate, so that,\r\nif either of them be regarded as an incident pencil, the other will be\r\nthe corresponding reflected pencil. Each point, in fact, sends a pencil\r\nof rays which converge, after reflection, to the conjugate focus. _The\r\nprincipal focal distance is half the radius of curvature._ But it will\r\nnot escape attention that concave mirrors have two reflecting surfaces,\r\na front and a back. This, however, does not practically disturb its\r\n_virtual focus_, since the achromatic condenser when brought into use\r\ncollects and concentrates the light received from the mirror upon an\r\nobject for the purpose of rendering it more distinctly visible to the\r\neye when viewing an object placed on the stage of the microscope. The\r\nimages seen in a plane mirror are always virtual, and any spherical\r\nmirror, whether concave or convex, is nearly equivalent to a plane\r\nmirror when the distance of the object from its surface is small in\r\ncomparison with the radius of curvature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLenses.\r\n\r\n=Forms of Lenses.=--A lens is a portion of a refracting medium bounded\r\nby two surfaces which are portions of spheres, having a common axis,\r\ntermed the _axis of the lens_. Lenses are distinguished by different\r\nnames, according to the nature of their surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Converging and Diverging Lenses.]\r\n\r\nLenses with sharp edges (thicker at the centre) are _convergent_ or\r\n_positive_ lenses. Lenses with blunt edges (thinner at the centre) are\r\n_divergent_ or _negative_ lenses. The first group comprises:--(1) The\r\nbi-convex lens; (2) the plano-convex lens; (3) the convergent meniscus.\r\nThe second group:--(4) The concave lens; (5) the plano-concave lens;\r\n(6) the divergent meniscus (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n=Principal Focus.=--A lens is usually a solid of revolution, and the\r\naxis of revolution is termed the principal axis of the lens. When the\r\nsurfaces are spherical it is the line joining the centre of curvature.\r\n\r\nFrom the great importance of lenses, especially convex lenses, in\r\npractical optics, it will be necessary to explain their properties\r\nsomewhat at length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Principal Focus of a Convex Lens.]\r\n\r\n=Principal Focus of Convex Lens.=--When rays which were originally\r\nparallel to the principal axis pass through a convex lens (Fig. 9),\r\nthe effect of the two refractions which they undergo, one on entering\r\nand the other on leaving the lens, is to make them all converge\r\napproximately to one point F, which is called the principal focus.\r\nThe distance A F of the principal focus from the lens is called the\r\nprincipal focal distance, or more briefly and usually, the focal length\r\nof the lens. The radiant point and its image after refraction are known\r\nas the conjugate foci. In every lens the right line perpendicular to\r\nthe two surfaces is the _axis_ of the lens. This is indicated by the\r\nline drawn through the several lenses, as seen in the diagram (Fig. 8).\r\nThe point where the axis cuts the surface of the lens is termed the\r\n_verte_.\r\n\r\nParallel rays falling on a _double-convex_ lens are brought to a focus\r\nin the centre of its diameter; conversely, rays diverging from that\r\npoint are rendered parallel. Hence the focus of a _double-convex_\r\nlens will be at just half the distance, or half the length, of the\r\nfocus of a _plano-convex_ lens having the same curvature on one side.\r\nThe distance of the focus from the lens will depend as much on the\r\ndegree of curvature as upon the refracting power (termed the index\r\nof refraction) of the glass of which it may be formed. A lens of\r\ncrown-glass will have a longer focus than a similar one of flint-glass;\r\nsince the latter has a greater refracting power than the former.\r\nFor all ordinary practical purposes we may consider the _principal\r\nfocus_--as the focus for parallel rays is termed--of a double-convex\r\nlens to be at the distance of its radius, that is, in its centre of\r\ncurvature; and that of a plano-convex lens to be at the distance of\r\ntwice its radius, that is, at the other end of the diameter of its\r\nsphere of curvature. The converse of all this occurs when divergent\r\nrays are made to fall on a convex lens. Rays already converging are\r\nbrought together at a point nearer than the principal focus; whereas\r\nrays diverging from a point within the principal focus are rendered\r\nstill more diverging, though in a diminished degree. Rays diverging\r\nfrom points more distant than the principal focus on either side, are\r\nbrought to a focus beyond it: if the point of divergence be within the\r\ncircle of curvature, the focus of convergence will be beyond it; and\r\n_vice-versâ_. The same principles apply equally to a _plano-convex\r\nlens_; allowance being made for the double distance of its principal\r\nfocus; and also to a lens whose surfaces have different curvatures; the\r\nprincipal focus of such a lens is found by multiplying the radius of\r\none surface by the radius of the other, and dividing this product by\r\nhalf the sum of the radii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Principal Focus of Concave Lens.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a concave lens (Fig. 10), rays incident parallel to the\r\nprincipal axis diverge after passing through; and their directions,\r\nif produced backwards, would approximately meet in a point F; this is\r\nits _principal focus_. It is, however, only a virtual focus, inasmuch\r\nas the emergent rays do not actually pass through it, whereas the\r\nprincipal focus of a converging lens is real.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Principal Centre of Lens.]\r\n\r\n=Optical Centre of a Lens.=--_Secondary Axes._--Let O and O′ (Fig. 11)\r\nbe the centres of the two spherical surfaces of a lens. Draw any two\r\nparallel radii, O I, O′ E, to meet these surfaces, and let the joining\r\nline I E represent a ray passing through the lens. This ray makes equal\r\nangles with the normals at I and E, since these latter are parallel by\r\nconstruction; hence the incident and emergent rays S I, E R also make\r\nequal angles with the normals, and are therefore parallel. In fact, if\r\ntangent planes (indicated by the dotted lines in the figure) are drawn\r\nat I and E, the whole course of the ray S I E R will be the same as if\r\nit had passed through a plate bounded by these planes.\r\n\r\nLet C be the point in which the line I E cuts the principal axis, and\r\nlet R, R′ denote the radii of the two spherical surfaces. Then from\r\nthe similarity of the triangles O C I, O′ C E, we have (O C)/(C O′) =\r\nR′/R; which shows that the point C divides the line of centres O O′ in\r\na definite ratio depending only on the radii. Every ray whose direction\r\non emergence is parallel to its direction before entering the lens,\r\nmust pass through the point C in traversing the lens; and conversely,\r\nevery ray which in its course through the lens traverses the point C,\r\nhas parallel directions at incidence and emergence. The point C which\r\npossesses this remarkable property is called the _centre_, or _optical\r\ncentre_, of the lens.\r\n\r\nThis diagram may also be taken to prove my former proposition, that the\r\nconvex lens is practically a form of two prisms combined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Conjugate Foci, one Real, the other Virtual.]\r\n\r\n=Conjugate Foci, one Real, one Virtual.=--When two foci are on the same\r\nside of the lens, one (the most distant of the two) must be virtual.\r\nFor example, in Fig. 12, if S, S′ are a pair of conjugate foci, one of\r\nthem S being between the principal focus F and the lens, rays sent to\r\nthe lens at a luminous point at S, will, after emergence, diverge as\r\nif from S′; and rays coming from the other side of the lens, if they\r\nconverge to S′ before incidence, will in reality be made to meet in\r\nS. As S moves towards the lens, S′ moves in the same direction more\r\nrapidly; and they become coincident at the surface of the lens.\r\n\r\n=Formation of Real Images.=--Let A B (Fig. 13) be an object in front\r\nof a lens, at a distance less than the principal focal length. It will\r\nhave a real image on the other side of the lens. To determine the\r\nposition of the image by construction, draw through any point A of the\r\nobject a line parallel to the principal axis, meeting the lens in A′.\r\nThe ray represented by this line will, after refraction, pass through\r\nthe principal focus, F, and its intersection with the secondary axis,\r\nA O, determines the position of _a_, the focus conjugate to A. We can\r\nin like manner determine the position of _b_, the focus conjugate to B,\r\nanother point of the object; and the joining line _a b_ will then be\r\nthe magnified image of the line A B. It is evident that if _a b_ were\r\nthe object, A B would be the image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Real and Magnified Image.]\r\n\r\nThe figures 12 and 13 represent the cases in which the distance of the\r\nobject is respectively greater and less than twice the focal length of\r\nthe lens.\r\n\r\nThe focal length of a lens is determined by the convexity of its\r\nsurfaces and the refractive power of the material of which it is\r\ncomposed, being shortened either by an increase of refractive power,\r\nor diminution of the radii of curvature of the faces of the lens. The\r\nincrease or decrease of spherical aberration is determined by the\r\nshape or curvature of the lens; it is less in the bi-convex than in\r\nother forms. When a lamp or other source of light is placed at the\r\nfocus of the rays constituting that portion of its light which falls\r\nupon the lens, the light is so refracted as to become parallel. Should\r\nthe source of light be brought nearer to the lens than the focus the\r\nrefracted rays are still divergent, though not to the same extent;\r\non the other hand, if the source be beyond the focus, the refracted\r\nrays are rendered convergent so as to meet at a point which is\r\nmathematically related to the distance of the luminous source from the\r\nfocus. The former arrangement is that with which we are most familiar,\r\nsince it is the ordinary magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcave Lenses.\r\n\r\nThe refracting influence of a _concave_ lens (Fig. 14) will be\r\nprecisely the opposite of that of a convex. Rays which fall upon it in\r\na parallel direction will be made to diverge as if from the principal\r\nfocus, which is here called the _negative_ focus. This will be, for a\r\n_plano-concave_ lens, at the distance of the diameter of the sphere of\r\ncurvature; and for a _double-concave_, in the centre of that sphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--A Virtual Image formed by Concave Lens.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 14 A B is the object and _a b_ the image. Rays incident from A\r\nand B parallel to the principal axis will emerge as if they came from\r\nthe principal focus F; hence, the points _a b_ are determined by the\r\nintersections of the dotted lines in the figure with the secondary\r\naxis, O A, O B. An eye on the other side of the lens sees the image _a\r\nb_, which is always virtual, erect and diminished.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the microscope, either simple or compound, the\r\ncurvature of the lenses employed is usually spherical. Convergent\r\nlenses, with spherical curvatures, have the defect of not bringing all\r\nthe rays of light which pass through them to one and the same focus.\r\nEach circle of rays from the axis of the lens to its circumference\r\nhas a different focus, as shown in Fig. 15. The rays _a a_, which\r\npass through the lens near its circumference, are seen to be _more\r\nrefracted_, or come to a focus at a shorter distance behind it than\r\nthe rays _b b_, which pass through near its centre or axis, and are\r\n_less refracted_. The consequence of this defect of lenses with\r\nspherical curvatures, which is called _spherical aberration_, is that\r\na well-defined image or picture is not formed by them, for when the\r\nobject is focussed, for the circumferential rays, the picture projected\r\nto the eye is rendered indistinct by a halo or confusion produced by\r\nthe central rays falling in a circle of dissipation, before they have\r\ncome to a focus. On the other hand, when placed in the focus of the\r\ncentral rays, the picture formed by them is rendered indistinct by the\r\nhalo produced by the circumferential rays, which have already come to\r\na focus and crossed, and now fall in a state of divergence, forming a\r\ncircle of dissipation. The grosser defects of spherical aberration are\r\ncorrected by cutting off the passage of the rays _a a_, through the\r\ncircumferences of the lens, by means of a stop diaphragm, so that the\r\ncentral rays, _b b_, only are concerned in the formation of the image.\r\nThis defect is reduced to a minimum, by using the meniscus form of\r\nlens, which is the segment of an ellipsoid instead of a sphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Spherical Aberration of Lens.]\r\n\r\nThe ellipse and the hyperbola are forms of lenses in which the\r\ncurvature diminishes from the central ray, or axis, to the\r\ncircumference _b_; and mathematicians have shown that spherical\r\naberration may be practically got rid of by employing lenses whose\r\nsections are ellipses or hyperbolas. The remarkable discovery of\r\nthese forms of lenses is attributed to Descartes, who mathematically\r\ndemonstrated the fact.\r\n\r\nIf _a l_, _a l′_, for example (Fig. 16) be part of an ellipse whose\r\ngreater axis is to the distance between its foci _f f_ as the index of\r\nrefraction is to unity, then parallel rays _r l′_, _r′′ l_ incident\r\nupon the elliptical surface _l′ a l_, will be refracted by the single\r\naction of that surface into lines which would meet exactly in the\r\nfarther focus _f_, if there were no second surface intervening between\r\n_l a l′_ and _f_. But as every useful lens must have two surfaces, we\r\nhave only to describe a circle _l a′ l′_ round _f_ as a centre, for the\r\nsecond surface of the lens _l′ l_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Converging Meniscus.]\r\n\r\nAs all the rays refracted at the surface _l a l′_ converge accurately\r\nto _f_, and as the circular surface _l a′ l′_ is perpendicular to every\r\none of the refracted rays, all these rays will go on to _f_ without\r\nsuffering any refraction at the circular surface. Hence it should\r\nfollow, that a meniscus whose convex surface is part of an ellipsoid,\r\nand whose concave surface is part of any spherical surface whose centre\r\nis in the farther focus, will have no appreciable spherical aberration,\r\nand will refract parallel rays incident on its convex surface to the\r\nfarther focus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Aplanatic Doublet.]\r\n\r\nThe spherical form of lens is that most generally used in the\r\nconstruction of the microscope. If a true elliptical or hyperbolic\r\ncurve could be ground, lenses would very nearly approach perfection,\r\nand spherical aberration would be considerably reduced. Even this\r\ndefect can be further reduced in practice by observing a certain ratio\r\nbetween the radii of the anterior and posterior surfaces of lenses;\r\nthus the spherical aberration of a lens, the radius of one surface of\r\nwhich is six or seven times greater than that of the other, will be\r\nmuch reduced when its more convex surface is turned forward to receive\r\nparallel rays, than when its less convex surface is turned forwards. It\r\nshould be borne in mind that in lenses having curvatures of the kind\r\nthe object would only be correctly seen in focus at one point--the\r\nmathematical or geometrical axis of the lens.\r\n\r\n=Chromatic Aberration.=--We have yet to deal with one of the most\r\nimportant of the phenomena of light, CHROMATIC ABERRATION, upon the\r\ncorrection of which, in convex lenses in particular, the perfection\r\nof the objective of the microscope so much depends. Chromatism arises\r\nfrom the unequal refrangibility and length of the different coloured\r\nrays of light that together go to make up white light; but which, when\r\ntreated of in optics, is always associated with _achromatism_, so that\r\na combination of prisms, or lenses, is said to be _achromatic_ when\r\nthe coloured rays arising from the dispersion of the pencil of light\r\nrefracted through them are combined in due proportions as they are in\r\nperfectly white light.\r\n\r\nA lens, however, of uniform material will not form a single white\r\nimage, but a series of images of all colours of the spectrum, arranged\r\nat different distances, the violet being nearest, and the red the most\r\nremote, every other colour giving a blurred image; the superposition\r\nof these and the blending of the different elementary rays furnishing\r\na complete explanation of the beautiful phenomenon of the rainbow.\r\nSharpness of outline is rendered quite impossible in such a case, and\r\nthis source of confusion is known as _chromatic aberration_.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain whether it is possible to remedy this evil\r\nby combining lenses of two different materials, Newton made some\r\ntrials with a compound prism composed of glass and water (the latter\r\ncontaining a little sugar of lead), and he found it impossible by any\r\narrangement of these two, or by other substances, to produce deviation\r\nof the transmitted light without separation into its component colours.\r\nIf this ratio were the same for all substances, as Newton supposed,\r\nachromatism would be impossible; but, in fact, its value varies\r\ngreatly, and is far greater for flint than for crown glass. If two\r\nprisms of these substances, of small refracting angles, be combined\r\ninto one, with their edges turned in opposite directions, they will\r\nachromatise each other.\r\n\r\nThe chromatism of lenses may, however, be somewhat further reduced by\r\nstopping out the marginal rays, but as the most perfect correction\r\npossible is required when lenses are combined for microscopic uses,\r\nother means of correction are resorted to, as will be seen hereafter.\r\nI shall first proceed to show the deviations which rays of white light\r\nundergo in traversing a lens.\r\n\r\nIf parallel rays of light pass through a double-convex lens the violet\r\nrays, the most refrangible of them, will come to a focus at a point\r\nmuch nearer to the lens than the focus of the red rays, which are the\r\nleast refrangible; and the intermediate rays of the spectrum will be\r\nfocussed at points between the red and the violet. A screen held at\r\neither of these foci will show an image with prismatic fringes. The\r\nwhite light, A A′′ (Fig. 18), falling on the marginal portion of the\r\nlens is so far decomposed that the violet rays are brought to a focus\r\nat C, and crossing there, diverge again and pass on to F F′, while the\r\nred rays, B B′′, do not come to a focus until they reach the point D,\r\nand cross the divergent violet rays, E E′. The foci of the intermediary\r\nrays of the spectrum (red, green, and blue) are intermediate between\r\nthese extremes. The distance, C D, limiting the blue or violet, and the\r\nred is termed the longitudinal chromatic aberration of the lens. If the\r\nimage be received upon a screen placed at C, violet will predominate\r\nand appear surrounded by a prismatic fringe, in which violet will\r\npredominate. If the screen be now shifted to D, the image will have a\r\npredominant red tint, surrounded by a series of coloured fringes in an\r\ninverted order to those seen in the former experiment. The line E E′\r\njoins the points of intersection between the violet and red rays, and\r\nthis marks the mean focus, the point where the coloured rays will be\r\nleast apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Chromatic Aberration of Lens.]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this century the optical correction of chromatic\r\naberration was partially brought about by combining a convex lens of\r\ncrown-glass with a concave lens of flint-glass, in the proportion of\r\nwhich these two kinds of glass respectively refract and disperse rays\r\nof light; so that the one medium may by equal and contrary dispersion\r\nneutralise the dispersion caused by the other, without at the same\r\ntime wholly neutralising its refraction. It is a curious fact that the\r\nmedia found most available for the purpose should be a combination of\r\ncrown and flint-glass, of _crown-glass_ whose index of refraction is\r\n1·519, and dispersive power 0·036, and of _flint-glass_ whose index\r\nof refraction is 1·589, and dispersive power 0·0393. The focal length\r\nof the convex crown-glass lens must be 4-1/3 inches, and that of the\r\nconcave flint-glass lens 7-2/3 inches, and the combined focal length 10\r\ninches. The diagram (Fig. 19) shows how rays of light are brought to a\r\nfocus, nearly free from colour. The small amount of residual colour in\r\nsuch a combination is termed the _secondary spectrum_; the violet ray\r\nF Y, crossing the axis of the lens at V, and going to the upper end P\r\nof the spectrum, the red ray F B going to the lower end T. But as the\r\nflint-glass lens _l l_, on the prism A _a_ C, which receives the rays\r\nF V, F R, at the same points, is interposed, these rays will unite at\r\n_f_, and form a small circle of white light, the ray S F being now\r\nrefracted without colour from its primitive direction S F Y into the\r\ndirection F _f_. In like manner, the corresponding ray S F′ will be\r\nrefracted to _f_, and a white colourless image be the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Correction of Chromatic Aberration.]\r\n\r\nThe achromatic aplanatic objective constructed on the optical formula\r\nenunciated, did not meet all the difficulties experienced by the\r\nskilled microscopist, in obtaining resolution of the finest test\r\nobjects, and whereby the intrinsic value of the objective (in his\r\nestimation) must stand or fall. There were other disturbing residuary\r\nelements besides those of the secondary spectrum, and which at a later\r\nperiod were met by the practical skill of the optician, who applied the\r\nscrew-collar, and by means of which the back lens of the objective is\r\nmade to approach the front lens, thus more accurately shortening the\r\ndistance between the eye-piece, where the image is eventually formed,\r\nand the back lens of the objective.\r\n\r\nIn this diagram L L is a _convex_ lens of _crown-glass_, and _l l_ a\r\n_concave_ one of _flint-glass_. A convex lens will refract a ray of\r\nlight (S) falling at F on it exactly in the same manner as the prism A\r\nB C, whose faces touch the two surfaces of the lens at the points where\r\nthe ray enters, and quits. The ray S F, thus refracted by the lens L\r\nL, or prism A B C, would have formed a spectrum (P T) on a screen or\r\nwall, had there been no other lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Virtual Image formed by Convex Lens.]\r\n\r\n=Formation of Virtual Images.=--The normal eye possesses a considerable\r\npower of adjusting itself to form a distinct image of objects placed\r\nat varying distances; the nearer, within a certain limit, the larger\r\nit appears, and the more distinctly the details are brought out.\r\nWhen brought within a distance of two or three inches, the images\r\nbecome blurred or quite indistinct, and when brought closer to the\r\neye, cannot be seen at all, and it simply obstructs the light. Now\r\nthe utility of a convex lens, when interposed between the object and\r\nthe eye, consists in reducing the divergence of the rays forming the\r\nseveral pencils which issue from it, and send images to the retina in\r\na state of moderate divergence, that is, as if they had issued from an\r\nobject beyond the nearest point of distinct vision, and so that a more\r\nclearly defined image may reach the sensitive membrane of the eye. But,\r\nnot only is the course of the several rays in each pencil altered as\r\nregards the rest, but the course of the pencils themselves is changed,\r\nso that they enter the eye under an angle corresponding with that\r\nunder which they would have arrived from a larger object situated at a\r\ngreater distance, and thus the picture formed by any object corresponds\r\nin all respects with one which would have been made by the same\r\nobject increased in its dimensions and viewed at the smallest ordinary\r\ndistance of distinct vision. For instance, let an object A B (Fig. 20)\r\nbe placed between a convex lens and its principal focus. Then the foci\r\nconjugate to the points A B are virtual, and their positions can be\r\nfound by construction from the consideration that rays through A, B,\r\nparallel to the principal axis, will be refracted to F, the principal\r\nfocus on the other side. The refracted rays, if produced backwards,\r\nmust meet the secondary axis O A, O B in the required points. An eye\r\nplaced on the other side of the lens will accordingly see a virtual\r\nimage erect, magnified, and at a greater distance from the lens than\r\nthe object. This is the principle of the simple microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Human Eye.\r\n\r\nTo gain a clear insight into the mode in which a single lens serves to\r\nmagnify objects, it will be necessary to revert to the phenomena of\r\nordinary vision. An eye free from any defect has a considerable power\r\nof adjusting itself to very considerable distances. One of the special\r\nfunctions of the eye is bringing the rays of light, by a series of\r\ndioptric mechanisms, to a perfect focus on its nervous sensitive layer,\r\nthe retina. The eye in this respect has been compared to a photographic\r\ncamera. But this is not quite correct. The retina is destined simply\r\nto receive the images furnished by the dioptric apparatus, and has no\r\ninfluence upon the formation of these images. The luminous rays are\r\nrefracted by the dioptric apparatus; the images would be formed quite\r\nas well--indeed, even better in certain cases--if the retina were not\r\nthere. The dioptric apparatus and its action are absolutely independent\r\nof the retina.\r\n\r\nThe same laws with regard to the passage of the rays of light into the\r\nhuman eye hold good, as those already enunciated in the previous pages.\r\nAs to change of direction when rays are passing obliquely from a medium\r\nof low density to that of a higher density, _i.e._, it changes its\r\ncourse, and is bent towards the perpendicular. On leaving the denser\r\nfor the rarer medium it is bent once more from the perpendicular.\r\nAgain, by means of a convex lens, the rays of light from one source\r\nwill be refracted so as to meet at a point termed _the principal focus_\r\nof vision.\r\n\r\nIn the eye there are several surfaces separating the different media\r\nwhere refraction takes place. The refractive index of the aqueous\r\nhumour and the tears poured out by the lachrymal gland is almost equal\r\nto that of the cornea. We may, therefore, speak of the refracting\r\nsurfaces as three, viz.: Anterior surface of cornea, anterior surface\r\nof lens, and posterior surface of lens; and also of the refracting\r\nmedia as three--the aqueous humour, the lens, and vitreous humour.\r\nThese several bodies are so adapted in the normal eye that parallel\r\nrays falling on the cornea are converged to a focus at the most\r\nsensitive spot (the _yellow spot_, or _fovea centralis_) in the retina,\r\na point representing to the principal focus of the eye. A line drawn\r\nfrom this point through the centre of the cornea is called the optic\r\naxis of the eye-ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Nerve and Stellate Cell Layer of Cornea,[6]\r\nstained by chloride of gold; magnified 300 diameters. _a_, Nerve cells.\r\n_b_, Stellate cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 22.--Anterior section of Eye, showing changed form of lens during\r\nthe act of accommodation, a voluntary action in the eye. M, Ciliary\r\nmuscle; I, Iris; L, Lens; V, Vitreous Humour; A, Aqueous Humour; C,\r\nCornea and optic axis.]\r\n\r\nBut as we are able to form a distinct image of near objects, and as\r\nwe notice when we turn our gaze from far to near objects there is a\r\ndistinct feeling of muscular effort in the eyes, there must be some\r\nmeans whereby the eye can readily adapt itself for focussing near and\r\ndistant objects. In a photographic camera the focus can be readily\r\naltered, either by changing the lenses, employing a lens of greater\r\nor less curvature, or by altering the distance of the screen from the\r\nlens. The last method is obviously impossible in the rigid eye-ball,\r\nand therefore the act of focussing for near and distant objects is\r\nassociated with a change in the curvature of the lens, a faculty of the\r\neye termed _accommodation_ (Fig. 22), a change chiefly accomplished\r\nby the ciliary (muscle) processes, which pull the lens forwards and\r\ninwards by virtual contracting power of the ciliary muscle, and by\r\nwhich its suspensory ligament is relaxed, and the front of the lens\r\nallowed to bulge forward. In every case, however, accommodation is\r\nassociated with contraction of the iris, the special function of which\r\nis that of a limiting diaphragm (an iris-diaphragm), Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary spherical bi-convex lens, as already pointed out, the\r\nrays of light passing through the periphery of the lens come to a focus\r\nat a nearer point than the rays passing through the central portion.\r\nIn this way a certain amount of blurring of the image takes place, and\r\nwhich, in optical language, is termed _spherical aberration_. This\r\ndefect of the eye is capable of correction in three possible ways,\r\nand which it may be well to repeat: 1. By making the refractive index\r\nof the lens higher at its centre than at its circumference; (2) By\r\nmaking the curvature of the lens less near the circumference than\r\nat the centre; (3) By stopping out the peripheral rays of light by a\r\ndiaphragm. The two latter methods are those resorted to in most optical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--1. Equatorial section of Eyeball, showing\r\nIris and Ciliary Processes, after washing away the pigment, × three\r\ndiameters.\r\n\r\n2. Nerves of the Cornea of Kitten’s Eye, stained with iodine.\r\n\r\n3. Fibres or Tubules of Lens, × 250, seen to be made up of superimposed\r\ncrenated layers, and is therefore not homogeneous in structure, but\r\nmade up of a number of extremely fine tubules, whose curvatures are\r\nnearly spherical.]\r\n\r\nIn the human eye an attempt is made to apply all these methods, but\r\nthe most important is the third, that of applying the diaphragm formed\r\nby the iris, a circular semi-muscular curtain lying just in front of\r\nthe anterior surface of the lens. The iris is also furnished with a\r\nlayer of pigmental cells which effectually stop out all peripheral\r\nrays of light that otherwise would pass into the eye, creating circles\r\nof diffusion of a disturbing nature to perfect vision. This delicate\r\nmembrane, then, is kept in constant action by a two-fold nerve supply,\r\nderived from five or six sources, which it is unnecessary to describe\r\nat length. But the eye, with all its marvellous adaptations, has an\r\nobvious defect, that of secondary or uncorrected chromatic aberration.\r\n\r\n=Chromatic Aberration of the Eye.=--White light, as previously\r\nexplained, is composed of different wave lengths; and accordingly as\r\nthese undulations are either longer or shorter, so do they produce\r\non the eye the impression of different colours. We have seen how a\r\npencil of white light may, by means of a prism, be decomposed into a\r\nmulti-coloured band. In an ordinary magnifying reading-glass these\r\ncoloured fringes are always seen around the margins. In practical\r\noptics chromatic aberration is partially corrected by employing two\r\ndifferent kinds of glass in the construction of certain combined\r\nlenses. In the human eye chromatism cannot be corrected in this way;\r\nhence a blue light and a red light placed at the same distance from the\r\neye appears to be unequally distant: the red light requiring greater\r\naccommodation in the eye than the blue, and this accordingly appears to\r\nbe the nearer of the two.\r\n\r\nThis visual error may be experimentally shown and explained. There is\r\na kind of glass which at first sight appears dark blue or violet, but\r\nwhich really contains a great deal of red. Take an ordinary microscope\r\nlamp, having a metal or opaque chimney, and drill a circular hole in\r\nit, about 3 mm. in diameter. This opening should be just at the height\r\nof the flame; cover it over with a piece of ground glass and a piece of\r\nthe red-blue glass. Thus will be formed a luminous point whose light is\r\ncomposed of red and blue, _i.e._, of colours far apart from each other\r\nin the spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Chromatic Aberration of Eye, showing the wave\r\ndifferences of the _blue and red rays of light_ (_Landolt_).]\r\n\r\nIf rays coming from this point enter the eye, the blue rays (Fig. 24),\r\nbeing more strongly reflected than the red, will come to a focus sooner\r\nthan the latter. The red rays, on the contrary, will be brought to a\r\nfocus later than the blue, while the latter, past their focus, are\r\ndiverging. Let A B C D (Fig. 24) be the section of a pencil of rays\r\ngiven off from a red-blue point sufficiently distant so that these rays\r\nmay be regarded as parallel. The focus of the blue is at _b_, that of\r\nthe red at _r_.\r\n\r\nAn eye is adapted to the distance of the luminous point when the circle\r\nof diffusion, received upon the retina, is at its minimum. This is the\r\ncase when the sentient layer of the retina lies between the two foci\r\nE. In this case the point will appear as a small circle, composed of\r\nthe two colours, that is to say--violet. If the retina be _in front_\r\nof this point, at the focus of the _blue_ rays for instance, the eye\r\nwill perceive a _blue point surrounded by a red circle_, the latter\r\nbeing formed by the periphery of the luminous cone of red rays, which\r\nare focussed only after having passed the retina. The blue point will\r\nbecome a circle of diffusion larger in proportion as the retina is\r\nnearer the dioptric system, or as the focus for blue is farther behind\r\nit. But the blue circle will always be surrounded by a red ring. If,\r\non the contrary, the retina is _behind the focus for red_, the blue\r\ncone will be greater in diameter than the red, and we shall have a _red\r\ncircle of diffusion_, larger in proportion as the retina is farther\r\nfrom the focus, but always _surrounded by a blue ring_ M. If the\r\nblue-red point is five metres, or more, distant, the _emmetropic_[7]\r\neye will evidently see it more distinctly, _i.e._, as a small _violet\r\npoint_; the _hyperopic_ eye, whose retina is situated _in front_ of the\r\nfocus of its dioptric system, will see a _blue circle, surrounded by\r\nred_; the _myopic_ eye, whose retina is _behind_ its focus, will see\r\na _red circle, surrounded by blue_. The size of these circles will be\r\neither larger or smaller when the principal focus of the eye is either\r\nin _front_ of or _behind the retina_.[8]\r\n\r\nThe refractive surfaces of a perfectly formed eye are very like an\r\nellipsoid of revolution with two axes, one of which, the major axis of\r\nthe ellipse, is at the same time the optic axis and that of rotation;\r\nthe other is perpendicular to it, and is equal in all meridians. Eyes,\r\nhowever, perfectly constructed are rarely met with. The curvature of\r\nthe cornea is nearly always greater in one meridian than in another.\r\nIts surfaces then cannot be regarded as entirely belonging to an\r\nellipsoid of revolution, since the solid figure, of which the former\r\nwould constitute a part, has not only two axes, but three, and these\r\nunequal. This irregularity is not, however, always great enough to\r\nproduce discomfort and it is therefore disregarded. But in other cases\r\nthe difference of curvature in the different meridians of the eye\r\nattain to a higher degree, and vision falls far below the average.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Lines as seen by the Astigmatic.]\r\n\r\nThe refractive anomaly alluded to is termed _astigmatism_ (from the\r\nGreek, α privative, στιγμα, a point--inability to see a point). The\r\nway in which objects appear to such a person will mainly result from\r\nthe way in which he sees _a point_. Take, for example, the vertical to\r\nbe the most, and the horizontal to be the least, refractive meridian:\r\nplace a vertical line (Fig. 25, I) at a stated distance before the\r\neye, and the line will appear elongated, owing to the diffusion image\r\nof each of the points composing it. It will also seem to be somewhat\r\nbroadened, as at II. If the _vertical_ meridian is adapted to the\r\ndistance of the vertical, the line will appear very diffuse and\r\nbroadened, as at III. All these little diffusion lines overlap each\r\nother, and give the line an elongated appearance. Hence a straight line\r\nis seen distinctly by an astigmatic eye only when the meridian to which\r\nit is perpendicular is perfectly adapted to its distance. A _vertical\r\nline_ is seen distinctly when the _horizontal meridian_ is adapted to\r\nits distance. It appears _indistinct_ when its image is formed by the\r\nvertical meridian. The way in which an astigmatic person sees points\r\nand lines led to the discovery of this remarkable irregularity in the\r\nrefraction of the eye. The late Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy,\r\nsuffered for some years until, indeed, he discovered how it could be\r\ncorrected. This anomaly of curvature of the refractive surfaces of the\r\neye is now known to prevail largely among the more civilised races of\r\nmankind. It is, then, of very great importance when using high powers\r\nof the microscope. In most persons the visual power of both eyes is\r\nrarely quite equal; on the other hand, the mind exerts an important\r\ninfluence, dominates, as it were, the eye in the interpretation of\r\nvisual sensations and images. An example of this is presented in\r\nWheatstone’s pseudoscope, known to produce precisely the opposite\r\neffect of his stereoscope--conveys, in fact, the _converse of relief_\r\nproduced by the latter and better known instrument.\r\n\r\n=Visual Judgment.=--The apparent size of an object is determined by\r\nthe magnitude of the image formed on the retina, and this is inversely\r\nproportional to the distance. Thus the size of an image on the retina\r\nof an object two inches long at a distance of a foot, is equal to the\r\nimage of an object four inches long at a distance of two feet. An\r\nobject can be seen if the visual angle subtended by it is not less than\r\nsixty seconds. This is equivalent to an image on the _fovea centralis_\r\nof the retina of about 4 µ[9] across, and which corresponds to the\r\ndiameter of a cone: so that while we have had under consideration the\r\noptical and physical conditions of human vision, we have likewise\r\ntaken a lesson on the action of lenses used in the construction of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory of Microscopical Vision.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that no comparison can be instituted between\r\nmicroscopic vision and macroscopic; that the images formed by minute\r\nobjects are not delineated microscopically under ordinary laws of\r\ndiffraction, and that the results are dioptrical. This assertion,\r\nhowever, cannot be accepted unconditionally, as will be seen on more\r\ncareful examination of the late Professor Abbe’s masterly exposition\r\nof “The Microscopical Theory of Vision,” and also his subsequent\r\ninvestigations on the estimation of aperture and the value of\r\nwide-angled immersion objectives, published in the “Journal of the\r\nRoyal Microscopical Society.”\r\n\r\nThe essential point in Abbe’s theory of microscopical vision is\r\nthat the images of minute objects in the microscope are not formed\r\nexclusively on the ordinary _dioptric_ method (that is, in the same\r\nway in which they are formed in the camera or telescope), but that\r\nthey are largely affected by the peculiar manner in which the minute\r\nconstruction of the object breaks up the incident rays, giving rise to\r\n_diffraction_.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of diffraction in general may be observed experimentally\r\nby plates of glass ruled with fine lines. Fig. 26 shows the appearance\r\npresented by a single candle-flame seen through such a plate, an\r\nuncoloured image of the flame occupying the centre, flanked on either\r\nside by a row of coloured spectra of the flame, which become dimmer as\r\nthey recede from the centre. A similar phenomenon may be produced by\r\ndust scattered over a glass plate, and by other objects whose structure\r\ncontains very minute particles, or the meshes of very fine gauze wire,\r\nthe rays suffering a characteristic change in passing through such\r\nobjects; that change consisting in the breaking up of a parallel beam\r\nof light into a group of rays, diverging with wide angle and forming\r\na regular series of maxima and minima of intensity of light, due to\r\ndifference of phase of vibration.[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in the microscope, the diffraction pencil originating\r\nfrom a beam incident upon, for instance, a diatom, appears as a fan of\r\nisolated rays, decreasing in intensity as they are further removed from\r\nthe direction of the incident beam transmitted through the structure,\r\nthe interference of the primary waves giving a number of successive\r\nmaxima of light with dark interspaces.\r\n\r\nWhen a diaphragm opening is interposed between the mirror, and a plate\r\nof ruled lines placed upon the stage such as Fig. 27, the appearance\r\nshown in Fig. 27_a_, will be observed at the back of the objective on\r\nremoving the eye-piece and looking down the tube of the microscope. The\r\ncentre circles are the images of the diaphragm opening produced by the\r\ndirect rays, while those on the other side (always at right angles to\r\nthe direction of the lines) are the diffraction images produced by the\r\nrays which are bent off from the incident pencil. In homogeneous light\r\nthe central and lateral images agree in size and form, but in white\r\nlight the diffraction images are radially drawn out, with the outer\r\nedges red and the inner blue (the reverse of the ordinary spectrum),\r\nforming, in fact, regular spectra the distance separating each of which\r\nvaries inversely as the closeness of the lines, being for instance with\r\nthe same objective twice as far apart when the lines are twice as close.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27_a_.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of these diffraction spectra may be demonstrated by some\r\nvery striking experiments, which show that they are not by any means\r\naccidental phenomena, but are directly connected with the image which\r\nis seen by the eye.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment shows that with the central beam, or any one of\r\nthe spectral beams alone, only the contour of the object is seen, the\r\naddition of at least one diffraction spectrum being essential to the\r\nvisibility of the structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28_a_.]\r\n\r\nWhen by a diaphragm placed at the back of the objective, as in Fig.\r\n28, we cover up all the diffraction spectra of Fig. 27_a_, and allow\r\nonly the central rays to reach the image, the object will appear to be\r\nwholly deprived of fine details, the outline alone will remain, and\r\nevery delineation of minute structure will disappear, just as if the\r\nmicroscope had suddenly lost its optical power, as in Fig. 28_a_.\r\n\r\nThis experiment illustrates a case of the _obliteration_ of structure\r\nby obstructing the passage of the diffraction spectra to the eye-piece.\r\nThe next experiment shows how the appearance of fine structure may be\r\n_created_ by manipulating the spectra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29_a_.]\r\n\r\nWhen a diaphragm such as that shown in Fig. 29 is placed at the back of\r\nthe objective, so as to cut off each alternate one of the upper row of\r\nspectra in Fig. 27_a_, that row will obviously become identical with\r\nthe lower one, and if the theory holds good, we should find the image\r\nof the upper lines identical with that of the lower. On replacing the\r\neye-piece, we see that it is so, the upper set of lines are doubled in\r\nnumber, a new line appearing in the centre of the space between each\r\nof the old (upper) ones, and upper and lower set having become to all\r\nappearance identical, as seen in Fig. 29_a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30_a_.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if we stop off all but the outer spectra, as in Fig.\r\n30, the lines are apparently again doubled, as seen in Fig. 30_a_.\r\n\r\nA case of apparent creation of structure, similar in principle to the\r\nforegoing, though more striking, is afforded by a network of squares,\r\nas in Fig. 31, having sides _parallel_ to this page, which gives the\r\nspectra shown in Fig. 31_a_, consisting of vertical rows for the\r\nhorizontal lines and horizontal rows for the vertical ones. But it is\r\nreadily seen that two diagonal rows of spectra exist at right angles to\r\nthe diagonals of the squares, just as would arise from sets of lines\r\nin the direction of the diagonals, so that if the theory holds good\r\nwe ought to find, on obstructing all the other spectra and allowing\r\nonly the diagonal ones to pass to the eye-piece, that the vertical and\r\nhorizontal lines have disappeared and are replaced by two new sets of\r\nlines at _right angles to the diagonals_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32_a_.]\r\n\r\nOn inserting the diaphragm, Fig. 32, and replacing the eye-piece, we\r\nfind in the place of the old network the one shown in Fig. 32_a_, the\r\nsquares being, however, smaller in the proportion of 1 : √2, as they\r\nshould be in accordance with the theory propounded.\r\n\r\nAn object such as _Pleurosigma angulatum_, which gives six diffraction\r\nspectra arranged as in Fig. 33, should, according to this theory, show\r\nmarkings in a hexagonal arrangement. For there will be one set of lines\r\nat right angles to _b_, _a_, _e_, another set at right angles to _c_,\r\n_a_, _f_, and a third at right angles to _g_, _a_, _d_. These three\r\nsets of lines will obviously produce the appearance shown in Fig. 33_a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nA great variety of appearances may be produced with the same\r\narrangement of spectra. Any two adjacent spectra with the central beam\r\n(as _b_, _c_, _a_) will form equilateral triangles and give hexagonal\r\nmarkings. Or by stopping off all but _g_, _c_, _e_ (or _b_, _d_, _f_),\r\nwe again have the spectra in the form of equilateral triangles; but\r\nas they are now further apart, the sides of the triangles in the two\r\ncases being as √3 : 1, the hexagons will be smaller and three times as\r\nnumerous. Their sides will also be arranged at a different angle to\r\nthose of the first set. The hexagons may be entirely obliterated by\r\nadmitting only the spectra _g_, _c_, or _g_, _f_, or _b_, _f_, etc.,\r\nwhen new lines will appear at right angles, or obliquely inclined, to\r\nthe median line. By varying the combinations of the spectra, therefore,\r\ndifferent figures of varying size and positions are produced, all\r\nof which cannot, of course, represent the true structure. Not only,\r\nhowever, may the appearance of particular structure be obliterated or\r\ncreated, but it may even be _predicted_ before being seen under the\r\nmicroscope. If the position and relative intensity of the spectra in\r\nany particular case are given, the character of the resultant image,\r\nin some instances, may be worked out by mathematical calculations. A\r\nremarkable instance of such a prediction is to be found in the case\r\nrecorded by Mr. Stephenson, where a mathematical student who had\r\nnever seen a diatom, worked out the purely mathematical result of the\r\ninterference of the six spectra _b-g_ of Fig. 33 (identical with _P.\r\nangulatum_), giving the drawing copied in Fig. 34. The special feature\r\nwas the small markings between the hexagons, which had not, before this\r\ntime, been noticed on _P. angulatum_. On more closely scrutinizing a\r\nvalve, stopping out the central beam and allowing the six spectra only\r\nto pass, the small markings were found actually to exist, though they\r\nwere so faint they had previously escaped observation until the result\r\nof the mathematical deduction had shown that they _ought_ to be seen.\r\n\r\nThese experiments seem to show that diffraction plays a very essential\r\npart in the formation of microscopical images, since dissimilar\r\nstructures give identical images when the differences of their\r\ndiffractive effect is removed, and conversely similar structures\r\nmay give dissimilar images when their diffractive images are made\r\ndissimilar. Whilst a purely dioptric image answers point for point\r\nto the object on the stage, and enables a safe inference to be drawn\r\nas to the actual nature of that object, the visible indications of\r\nminute structure in a microscopical image are not always or necessarily\r\nconformable to the real nature of the object examined, so that nothing\r\nmore can safely be inferred from the image as presented to the eye,\r\nthan the presence in the object of such structural peculiarities as\r\nwill produce the particular diffraction phenomena on which these images\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations and experiments led Abbe to discard so much of\r\nhis theoretical conclusions relating to superimposed images having\r\na distinct character as well as a different origin, and as to their\r\ncapability of being separated and examined apart from each other.\r\nIn a later paper he writes: “I no longer maintain in principle the\r\ndistinction between the absorption image or direct dioptrical image and\r\nthe diffraction image, nor do I hold that the microscopical image of\r\nan object consists of two superimposed images of different origin or a\r\ndifferent mode of production. Thus it appears that both the absorption\r\nimage and the diffraction image he held to be equally of diffraction\r\norigin; but while a lens of small aperture would give the former with\r\nfacility, it would be powerless to reveal the latter, because of its\r\nlimited capacity to gather in the strongly-deflected rays due to the\r\nexcessively minute bodies the microscopical objective has to deal\r\nwith.”[11]\r\n\r\nAbbe’s theory of vision has been questioned by mathematicians, and\r\nsince his death Lord Rayleigh went more deeply into the question of\r\n“the theory of the formation of optical images,” with special reference\r\nto the microscope and telescope. He has shown that two lines cannot\r\nbe fairly resolved unless their components subtend an angle exceeding\r\nthat subtended by the wave-length of light at a distance equal to the\r\naperture; also, that the measure of resolution is only possible with\r\na square aperture, or one bounded by straight lines, parallel to the\r\nlines resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rayleigh’s Theory of the Formation of Optical Images, with Special\r\nReference to the Microscope.[12]\r\n\r\nOf the two methods adopted, that of Helmholtz’s consists in tracing\r\nthe image representative of a mathematical point in the object, the\r\npoint being regarded as self-luminous; that of Abbe’s the typical\r\nobject was not, as we have seen, a luminous _point_, but a _grating_\r\nilluminated by plane waves of light. In the latter method, Lord\r\nRayleigh argues that the complete representation of the object\r\nrequires the co-operation of all the spectra which are focussed in the\r\nprincipal focal plane of the objective; when only a few are present\r\nthe representation is imperfect, and wholly fails when there is only\r\none. He then proceeds to show, by the aid of diagrams and mathematical\r\nformula, how the resolving power can be adduced.\r\n\r\nOn further criticism of the Abbe spectrum theory, he observes “that\r\nalthough the image ultimately formed may be considered to be due to\r\nthe spectra focussed to a given point, the degree of conformity of\r\nthe image to the object is another question. The consideration of the\r\ncase of a very fine grating, which might afford no lateral spectra at\r\nall, shows the incorrectness of the usually accepted idea that if all\r\nthe spectra are utilised the image will still be incomplete, so that\r\nthe theory (originally promulgated by Abbe) requires a good deal of\r\nsupplementing; while it is inapplicable when the incident light is\r\nnot parallel, and when the object is, for example, a double point and\r\nnot a grating. Even in the case of a grating, the spectrum theory is\r\ninapplicable, if the grating is self-luminous; for in this case no\r\nspectra can be formed since the radiations from the different elements\r\nof the grating have no permanent phase-relations.” For these reasons\r\nLord Rayleigh advises that the question should be reconsidered from\r\nthe older point of view, according to which the typical object is a\r\npoint and not a grating. Such treatment will show that the theory of\r\nresolving power is essentially the same for all instruments. The\r\npeculiarities of the microscope, arising from the divergence-angles\r\nnot being limited to be small, and from the different character of\r\nthe illumination, are theoretically only differences of detail. These\r\ninvestigations can be extended to gratings, and the results so obtained\r\nconfirm for the most part the conclusions of the spectrum theory.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, that the function of the condenser in microscopic practice\r\nin throwing upon the object the image of the lamp-flame is to cause\r\nthe object to behave, at any rate in some degree, as if it were\r\nself-luminous, and thus to obviate the sharply-marked interference\r\nbands which arise when permanent and definite phase-relations are\r\npermitted to exist between the radiations which issue from various\r\npoints of the object. This is capable of mathematical proof; and in\r\nthe case where the illumination is such that each point of the row or\r\nof the grating radiates independently, the limit to resolution is seen\r\nto depend only on the width of the aperture, and thus to be the same\r\nfor all forms of aperture as for those of the rectangular. That Abbe’s\r\ntheory of microscopic vision is fairly open to the criticisms passed on\r\nit by Lord Rayleigh must be taken for granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinition of Aperture; Principles of Microscopic Vision.\r\n\r\nIt must be well within the last half-century that the achromatic\r\nobjective-glass for the microscope was brought to perfection and its\r\nvalue became generally recognised. Prior to the discovery of the\r\nachromatic principle in the construction of lenses it was assumed that\r\nthe formation of the microscopic image took place (as we have already\r\nseen) on ordinary dioptric principles. As the image is formed in the\r\ncamera or telescope, so it was said to be in the microscope. This\r\nbelief existed, it will be remembered, at a time when dry objectives\r\nonly were in favour and the use of the term _angle of aperture_ was\r\nmisunderstood, when it was supposed that the different media with\r\ndiffraction-indices were used; and the angle of the radiant pencil was\r\nbelieved not only to admit of a comparison of two apertures in the same\r\nmedium, but likewise to admit of a standard of comparison when the\r\nmedia were entirely different in their refractive qualities.\r\n\r\nIt was during my tenure of office as secretary of the Royal\r\nMicroscopical Society (1867 to 1873), that the aperture question,\r\nand also that of _numerical aperture_, came under discussion, both\r\nbeing met by the majority of the Fellows of the Society and practical\r\nopticians by a _non-possumus_.\r\n\r\nOpticians alleged, that is, before the value of aperture became fully\r\nrecognised (1860), that the achromatic objective had reached a stage of\r\nperfection, beyond which it was not possible to go; indeed, not only\r\nopticians, but physicists of high standing, as Professor Helmholtz,\r\nwho made many important contributions to the theory of the microscope,\r\nand who, after duly weighing all the known physical laws on which the\r\nformation of images can be explained, emphatically stated that in\r\nhis opinion “the limit of possible improvement of the microscope as\r\nan instrument of discovery had been very nearly reached.” A quarter\r\nof a century ago I ventured to throw a doubt upon so questionable a\r\nstatement. I determined, if possible, to submit the aperture question\r\nto an exhaustive examination. My views were accordingly submitted to\r\ntwo of the highest authorities in this country--Sir George Airy, the\r\nthen Astronomer Royal, and Sir George Stokes, Professor of Physics at\r\nCambridge University--both of whom agreed with me that the possible\r\nincrease of aperture would be attended with great advantage to the\r\nobjective, and open the way to an extension of power resolution in the\r\nmicroscope.[13] The discussion afterwards took a warm turn, as will be\r\nseen on reference to “The Monthly Microscopical Journals” of 1874, 1875\r\nand 1876.\r\n\r\nThe confusion into which the aperture question at this period had\r\nlapsed was no doubt due to the fact that its opponents had not yet\r\ngrasped the true meaning of the term _aperture_. It was believed to be\r\nsynonymous with “angular aperture,” much in use at the time. It will,\r\nhowever, appear quite unaccountable that even the older opticians\r\nshould have confounded the latter with the former; and so entirely\r\ndisregarded the fact that the angles of the pencil of light admitted by\r\nthe objective cannot serve as a measure of its _aperture_, and that\r\nhigh refractive media can greatly reduce the value length of waves of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhen the medium in which the objective works is the same as air, it\r\nis not that a comparison can be made by the angles of the radiant\r\npencils only, but by their sines. For example, if two dry objectives\r\nadmit pencils of 60° and 180°, their real apertures are not as 1 : 3,\r\nbut as 1 : 2 only. Aperture in fact is computed by mathematicians by\r\ntracing the rays from the back focus through the system of lenses to\r\nthe front focus, the front focus being the point at which the whole\r\ncone of rays converge as free as may be from aberration. If the front\r\nfocus be in air, no pencil greater than 82°, “double the angle of\r\ntotal reflection,” can _emerge_ from the plane front of the lens; and,\r\nobviously, if no greater cone can emerge to a focus one way, neither\r\ncan any greater cone enter the body of the lens from the radiant. This\r\nangle, then, of 82°, must be regarded as the limit for dry lenses or\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nThis limit, it will be seen on more careful examination, is very nearly\r\nthe maximum angle that can be computed for a lens to have a front\r\nfocus in air. This can be proved by the consideration of the angle\r\nof the image of rays, as they are radiated from the object itself in\r\nbalsam: for although this angle of image rays viewed as nascent from a\r\nself-luminous object capable of scattering rays in all directions, may\r\nbe 180° in the substance of the balsam and cover-glass, of the 180°\r\nonly 82° of the central portion will emerge into air--all rays beyond\r\nthis limit are internally reflected at the cover-glass. This cone,\r\nthen, of 82° becomes 180° in air, and a large part must necessarily be\r\nlost by reflection at the first incidence on the plane front of the\r\nlens. But with a formula permitting the use of a water medium between\r\nthe front lens and the cover-glass, the aperture of the image rays may\r\nreach 126°--double the critical angle from glass to water; and with an\r\noil medium, the aperture will be found to be limited only by the form\r\nof the front lens that can be constructed by the optician.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the effect of the immersion system, greatly assists\r\nin the correction of aberration, gives increased magnification and\r\nangular aperture, increase of working distance between the objective\r\nand object, and renders admissible the use of the thicker glass-cover.\r\n\r\nThe aperture question would in all probability have remained unsolved\r\nmany years longer (ten or twelve years elapsed after I brought the\r\nquestion under discussion before opticians gave way), but for the\r\nfortunate circumstance that the eminent mathematical and practical\r\noptician, Professor Abbe, of Jena, was about to visit London. This\r\ncame off in the early part of the seventies, when the late Mr. John\r\nMayall and myself had the good fortune to interview him. The subject\r\ndiscussed was naturally the increase of aperture and the theory\r\nof microscopical vision. He readily at our request undertook to\r\nre-investigate the question in all its bearings on the microscope. It\r\nis almost unnecessary to add that the conclusions he came to, and the\r\nresults obtained, have proved of inestimable value to the microscopist\r\nand practical optician, and it may well seem necessary to explain\r\nsomewhat at greater length the conclusions the learned Professor came\r\nto, and by the adoption of which the microscope has been placed on a\r\nmore scientific basis than it had before attained to. Several papers\r\nwere published _in extenso_ in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety,” and I am greatly indebted to Mr. Frank Crisp, LL.D., for an\r\nexcellent _resumé_ of Abbe’s Monograph.[14]\r\n\r\nThe essential step in the consideration of aperture is, as I have\r\nsaid, to understand clearly what is meant by the term. It will at\r\nonce be recognised that its definition must necessarily refer to its\r\nprimary meaning of _opening_, and must, in the case of an optical\r\ninstrument, define its capacity for receiving rays from the object, and\r\ntransmitting them to the image received at the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the telescope-objective, its capacity for receiving and\r\ntransmitting rays is necessarily measured by the expression of its\r\nabsolute diameter or “opening.” No such absolute measure can be applied\r\nin the case of the microscope objective, the largest constructed lenses\r\nof which having by no means the largest apertures, being, in fact,\r\nthe lower powers of the instrument, whose apertures are for the most\r\npart but small. The capacity of a microscope objective for receiving\r\nand transmitting rays is, however, as will be seen, estimated by its\r\n_relative_ opening, that is, its opening in relation to its focal\r\nlength. When this relative opening has been ascertained, it may be\r\nregarded as synonymous with that denoted in the telescope by _absolute_\r\nopening. That this is so will be better appreciated by the following\r\nconsideration:--\r\n\r\nIn a single lens, the rays admitted within one meridional plane\r\nevidently increase as the diameter of the lens (all other circumstances\r\nremaining the same), and in the microscope we have, at the back of the\r\nlens, the same conditions to deal with as are in front in the case\r\nof the telescope; the larger or smaller number of emergent rays will\r\ntherefore be measured by the clear diameter, and as no rays can emerge\r\nthat have not first been admitted, this will give the measure of the\r\nadmitted rays under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf the lenses compared have different focal lengths but the same clear\r\n“openings,” they will transmit the same number of rays to equal areas\r\nof an image at a definite distance, because they would admit the same\r\nnumber if an object were substituted for the image; that is, if the\r\nlens were used as a telescope-objective. But as the focal lengths are\r\ndifferent, the amplification of the images is different also, and equal\r\nareas of these images correspond to different areas of the object from\r\nwhich the rays are collected. Therefore, the higher power lens with\r\nthe same opening as the lower power, will admit a _greater_ number of\r\nrays in all from the same object, because it admits the _same_ number\r\nas the latter from a _smaller_ portion of the object. Thus, if the\r\nfocal lengths of two lenses are as 2 : 1, and the first amplifies N\r\ndiameters, the second will amplify 2 N with the same distance of the\r\nimage, so that the rays which are collected _to_ a given field of 1\r\nmm. diameter of the image are admitted _from_ a field of 1/N mm. in\r\nthe first case, and of 1/(2N) mm. in the second. As the “opening” of the\r\nobjective is estimated by the diameter (and not by the area) the higher\r\npower lens admits _twice_ as many rays as the lower power, because\r\nit admits the same number from a field of half the diameter, and, in\r\ngeneral, the admission of rays by the same opening, but different\r\npowers, must be in the inverse ratio of the focal lengths.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the single lens, therefore, its aperture is determined\r\nby the ratio between the clear opening and the focal length. The same\r\nconsiderations apply to the case of a compound objective, substituting,\r\nhowever, for the clear opening of the single lens the diameter of\r\nthe pencil at its emergence from the objective, that is, the clear\r\nutilised diameter of the back lens. All equally holds good whether the\r\nmedium in which the objective is placed is the same in the case of the\r\ntwo objectives or different, as an alteration of the medium makes no\r\ndifference in the power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 180° Oil Angle.

(Numerical Aperture ·50.)\r\n\r\nFig. 35.--Relative diameters of the (utilized) back lenses of various\r\ndry and immersion objectives of the same power (1/4-in.) from an air\r\nangle of 60° to an oil angle of 180°.]\r\n\r\nThus we arrive at a general proposition for all kinds of objectives:\r\n1st, when the power is the same, the admission of rays (or aperture)\r\nvaries with the diameter of the pencil at its emergence; 2nd, when the\r\npowers are different, the same aperture requires different openings in\r\nthe ratio of the focal lengths, or conversely with the same opening the\r\naperture is in inverse ratio to the focal lengths. We see, therefore,\r\nthat just as in the telescope the absolute diameter of the object-glass\r\ndefines its _aperture_, so in the microscope _the ratio between the\r\nutilised diameter of the back lens and the focal length_ of the\r\nobjective defines its aperture also, and this is clearly a definition\r\nof aperture in its primary and only legitimate meaning as “opening;”\r\nthat is, the capacity of the objective for admitting rays from the\r\nobject and transmitting them to the image.\r\n\r\nIf, by way of illustration, we compare a series of dry and\r\noil-immersion objectives, and commencing with small air angles,\r\nprogress up to 180° air angle, and then take an oil-immersion of 82°\r\nand progress again to 180° oil angle, the ratio of opening to power\r\nprogresses also, and attains its maximum, not in the case of the air\r\nangle of 180° (when it is exactly equivalent to the oil angle of only\r\n82°), but is greatest at the oil angle of 180°. If we assume the\r\nobjectives to have the same power throughout we get rid of one of the\r\nfactors of the ratio, and we have only to compare the diameters of the\r\nemergent beams, and can represent their relations by diagrams.\r\n\r\nFig. 35 illustrates five cases of different apertures of 1/4-in.\r\nobjectives, viz.: those of dry objectives of 60°, 97°, and 180° air\r\nangle, a water-immersion of 180° water angle, and an oil-immersion of\r\n180° oil angle. The inner dotted circles in the two latter cases are of\r\nthe same size as that corresponding to the 180° air angle.\r\n\r\nA dry objective of the maximum air angle of 180° is only able to\r\nutilise a diameter of back lens equal to twice the focal length, while\r\nan immersion lens of even only 100° utilises a _larger_ diameter,\r\n_i.e._, it is able to transmit more rays from the object to the image\r\nthan any dry objective is capable of transmitting. Whenever the angle\r\nof an immersion lens exceeds twice the critical angle for the immersion\r\nfluid, _i.e._, 96° for water or 82° for oil, its aperture is in excess\r\nof that of a dry objective of 180°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\nThis excess will be _seen_ if we take an oil-immersion objective\r\nof, say 122° balsam angle, illuminating it so that the whole field\r\nis filled with the incident rays, and use it first on an object not\r\nmounted in balsam, but dry. We then have a _dry objective_ of nearly\r\n180° angular aperture, for, as will be seen by reference to Fig. 36,\r\nthe cover-glass is virtually the first surface of the objective, as\r\nthe front lens, the immersion fluid, and the cover-glass are all\r\napproximately of the same index, and form, therefore, a front lens\r\nof extra thickness. When the object is close to the cover-glass the\r\npencil radiating from it will be very nearly 180°, and the emergent\r\npencil (observed by removing the eye-piece) will be seen to utilise as\r\nmuch of the back lens of the objective as is equal to twice the focal\r\nlength, that is, the _inner_ of the two circles at the head of Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nIf now balsam be run in beneath the cover-glass so that the angle of\r\nthe pencil taken up by the objective is no longer 180°, but 122° only\r\n(that is, _smaller_), the diameter of the emergent pencil is _larger_\r\nthan it was before, when the angle of the pencil was 180° in air, and\r\nwill be approximately represented by the _outer_ circle of Fig. 35. As\r\nthe power remains the same in both cases, the larger diameter denotes\r\nthe greater aperture of the immersion objective over a dry objective of\r\neven 180° angle, and the excess of aperture is made plainly visible.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the principle, it is still necessary, however, to find a\r\nproper _notation_ for comparing apertures. The astronomer can compare\r\nthe apertures of his various objectives by simply expressing them in\r\ninches, but this is obviously not available to the microscopist, who\r\nhas to deal with the ratio of two varying quantities.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a discovery made by Professor Abbe in 1873, that a\r\ngeneral relation existed between the pencil admitted into the front of\r\nthe objective and that emerging from the back of the objective, he was\r\nable to show that the ratio of the semi-diameter of the emergent pencil\r\nto the focal length of the objective could be expressed by the formula\r\n_n_ Sin _u_, _i.e._, by the sine of half the angle of aperture (_u_)\r\nmultiplied by the refractive index of the medium (_n_) in front of the\r\nobjective (_n_ being 1·0 for air, 1·33 for water, and 1·52 for oil or\r\nbalsam).\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the values in any given cases of the expression _n_ Sin\r\n_u_ (which is known as the “numerical aperture”) has been ascertained,\r\nthe objectives are instantly compared as regards their aperture, and,\r\nmoreover, as 180° in air is equal to 1·0 (since _n_ = 1·0 and the\r\nsine of half 180° = 1·0) we see, with equal readiness, whether the\r\naperture is smaller or larger than that corresponding to 180° in air.\r\nThus, suppose we desire to compare the apertures of three objectives,\r\none a dry objective, the second a water immersion, and the third an\r\noil immersion; these would be compared on the angular aperture view\r\nas, say 74° air angle, 85° water angle, and 118° oil angle, so that\r\na calculation must be worked out to arrive at the actual relation\r\nbetween them. Applying, however, the _numerical_[15] notation, which\r\ngives ·60 for the dry objective, ·90 for the water immersion, and\r\n1·30 for the oil immersion, their relative apertures are immediately\r\nrecognised, and it is seen, for instance, that the aperture of the\r\nwater immersion is somewhat less than that of a dry objective of 180°,\r\nand that the aperture of the oil immersion exceeds that of the latter\r\nby 30%.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of immersion, in comparison with dry objectives, becomes\r\nat once apparent. Instead of consisting merely in a diminution of the\r\nloss of light by reflection or increased working distance, it is seen\r\nthat a wide-angled immersion objective has a larger aperture than a dry\r\nobjective of maximum angle, so that for any of the purposes for which\r\naperture is essential an immersion must necessarily be preferred to a\r\ndry objective.\r\n\r\nThat pencils of identical angular extension but in different media are\r\ndifferent physically, will cease to appear in any way paradoxical if we\r\nrecall the simple optical fact that rays, which in air are spread out\r\nover the whole hemisphere, are in a medium of higher refractive index\r\nsuch as oil _compressed_ into a cone of 82° round the perpendicular,\r\n_i.e._, twice the critical angle. A cone exceeding twice the critical\r\nangle of the medium will therefore embrace a _surplus_ of rays which do\r\nnot exist even in the hemisphere when the object is in air.\r\n\r\nThe whole aperture question, notwithstanding the innumerable\r\nperplexities which heretofore surrounded it, is in reality completely\r\nsolved by these two simple considerations: First, that “aperture” is\r\nto be applied in its ordinary meaning as representing the greater or\r\nless capacity of the objective for receiving and transmitting rays;\r\nand second, that when so applied the aperture of an objective is\r\ndetermined by the ratio between its opening and its focal length; the\r\nobjective that utilises the larger back lens (or opening) relatively\r\nto its focal length having necessarily the larger aperture. It would\r\nhardly, therefore, serve any useful purpose if we were here to discuss\r\nthe various erroneous ideas that gave rise to the contention that 180°\r\nin air must be the maximum aperture. Amongst these was the suggestion\r\nthat the larger emergent beams of immersion objectives were due to\r\nthe fact that the immersion fluid abolished the refractive action of\r\nthe first plane surface which, in the case of air, prevented there\r\nbeing any pencil exceeding 82° within the glass. Also the very curious\r\nmistake which arose from the assumption that a hemisphere did not\r\nmagnify an object at its centre because the rays passed through without\r\nrefraction. A further erroneous view has, however, been so widespread\r\nthat it seems to be desirable to devote a few lines to it, especially\r\nas it always appears at first sight to be both simple and conclusive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37_a_.]\r\n\r\nIf a dry objective is used upon an object in air, as in Fig. 37, the\r\nangle may approach 180°, but when the object is mounted in balsam,\r\nas in Fig. 37_a_, the angle at the object cannot exceed 82°, all\r\nrays outside that limit (shown by dotted lines) being reflected back\r\nat the cover-glass and not emerging into air. On using an immersion\r\nobjective, however, the immersion fluid which replaces the air above\r\nthe cover-glass allows the rays formerly reflected back to pass through\r\nto the objective, so that the angle at the object may again be nearly\r\n180° as with the dry lens. The action of the immersion objective was,\r\ntherefore, supposed to be simply that it repaired the loss in angle\r\nwhich was occasioned when the object was transferred from air to\r\nbalsam, and merely restored the conditions existing in Fig. 37_a_ with\r\nthe dry objective on a dry object.\r\n\r\nAs the result of this erroneous supposition, it followed that an\r\nimmersion objective could have no advantage over a dry objective,\r\nexcept in the case of the latter being used upon a balsam-mounted\r\nobject, its aperture then being (as was supposed) “cut down.” The\r\nerror lies simply in overlooking the fact that the rays which are\r\nreflected back when the object is mounted in balsam (Fig. 37_a_) are\r\nnot rays which are found when the object is in air (Fig. 37), but are\r\n_additional and different_ rays which do not exist in air, as they\r\ncannot be emitted in a substance of so low a refractive index.\r\n\r\nLastly, it should also be noted that it is numerical and not angular\r\naperture which measures the quantity of light admitted to the objective\r\nby different pencils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38_a_.]\r\n\r\nFirst take the case of the medium being the same. The popular notion\r\nof a pencil of light may be illustrated by Fig. 38, which assumes that\r\nthere is equal intensity of emission in all directions, so that the\r\nquantity of light contained in any given pencils may be compared by\r\nsimply comparing the contents of the solid cones. The Bouguer-Lambert\r\nlaw, however, shows that the quantity of light emitted by any bright\r\npoint varies with the obliquity of the direction of emission, being\r\n_greater_ in a perpendicular than in an oblique direction. The rays are\r\nless intense in proportion as they are more inclined to the surface\r\nwhich emits them, so that a pencil is not correctly represented by Fig.\r\n38, but by Fig. 38_a_, the density of the rays decreasing continuously\r\nfrom the vertical to the horizontal, and the squares of the sines of\r\nthe semi-angles (_i.e._, of the numerical aperture) constituting the\r\ntrue measure of the quantity of light contained in any solid pencil.\r\n\r\nIf, again, the media are of different refractive indices, as air\r\n(1·0), water (1·33), and oil (1·52), the total amount of light emitted\r\nover the whole 180° from radiant points in these media under a given\r\nillumination is not the same, but is _greater_ in the case of the\r\nmedia of greater refractive indices in the ratio of the squares of\r\nthose indices (_i.e._, as 1·0, 1·77 and 2·25). The quantity of light\r\nin pencils of different angle and in different media must therefore\r\nbe compared by squaring the product of the sines and the refractive\r\nindices, _i.e._ (_n_ Sin _u_^2), for the square of the numerical\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nThe fact is therefore made clear that the aperture of a dry objective\r\nof 180° does not represent, as was supposed, a maximum, but that\r\naperture increases with the increase in the refractive index of the\r\nimmersion fluid; and it should be borne in mind that this result has\r\nbeen arrived at in strict accordance with the ordinary propositions of\r\ngeometrical optics, and without any reference to or deductions from the\r\ndiffraction theory of Professor Abbe.\r\n\r\nThere still remains one other point for determination, namely, the\r\nproper function of aperture in respect to immersion objectives of large\r\naperture. The explanation of the increased power of vision obtained by\r\nincrease of aperture was, that by the greater obliquity of the rays\r\nto the object “shadow effects” were produced, a view which overlooked\r\nthe fact, first, that the utilisation of increased aperture depends\r\nnot only on the obliquity of the rays sent to the _object_, but also\r\nto the _axis of the microscope_; and exactly as there is no acoustic\r\nshadow produced by an obstacle, which is only a few multiples of the\r\nlength of the sound waves, so there can be no shadow produced by minute\r\nobjects, only a few multiples from the light waves, the latter then\r\npassing completely _round_ the object. The Abbe diffraction theory,\r\nhowever, supplies the true explanation of this, and shows that the\r\nincreased performance of immersion objectives of large aperture is\r\ndirectly connected (as might have been anticipated) with the larger\r\n“openings” in the proper sense of the term, which, as we have already\r\nexplained, such objectives really possess. Furthermore, in order that\r\nthe image exactly corresponds with the object, all diffracted rays\r\nmust be gathered up by the objective. Should any be lost we shall\r\nhave not an actual image of the object, but a spurious one. Now,\r\nif we have a coarse object, the diffracted rays are all comprised\r\nwithin a narrow cone round the direct beam, and an objective of small\r\naperture will transmit them all. With a minute object, however, the\r\ndiffracted rays are widely spread out, so that a small aperture can\r\nadmit only a fractional part--to admit the whole or a very large\r\npart, and consequently to see the minute structure of the object, or\r\nto see it truly, a large aperture is necessary, and in this lies the\r\nvalue of _aperture_ and of a _wide-angled immersion objective_ for the\r\nobservation of minute structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerical Aperture.\r\n\r\n=Measure of Apertures of Objectives. N.A.=--Numerical aperture, as it\r\nis termed, is measured by the scale of measurement calculated by the\r\nlate Professor Abbe, and which has since been generally recognised and\r\nadopted. He showed that even in lenses made for the same medium (as\r\nair) their comparative aperture as compared with their focus was not\r\ncorrectly measured by the angle of the rays grasped, but by the actual\r\ndiameters of the pencil of rays transmitted, which depend, as already\r\nseen, more upon the back of the lens than the front. To get a geometric\r\nmeasure for comparison, he took the radii, or half diameters (whose\r\nrelative proportions would be the same), and which geometrically are\r\nthe sines of the semi-angle of the outermost rays grasped. Abbe further\r\nshowed that if this sine of half the outside angle were multiplied by\r\nthe refractive index of the medium used we should have a number which\r\nwould give the comparative _aperture_ of any lens, whatever the medium.\r\nThis number, then, determines both the numerical aperture and the\r\nresolving power of the objective.\r\n\r\nThe following table of numerical apertures shows the respective angular\r\npencils which they express in air, water and cedar oil, or glass.[16]\r\nThe first column gives the numerical apertures from 0·20 to 1·33; the\r\nsecond, third, and fourth, the air, water and oil (or balsam) angles of\r\naperture from 23° 4′ air angle to 180° balsam angle. The theoretical\r\nresolving power in lines to the inch is shown in the sixth column; the\r\nline E of the spectrum being taken from about the middle of the green,\r\nthe column giving “illuminating power” being of less importance; while\r\nin using that of penetrating power, it must be remembered that several\r\ndata beside that of 1/_a_ go to make up the total depth of vision with\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRIDGED NUMERICAL APERTURE TABLE.\r\n\r\n  =====+=========================+==========================+======+======\r\n       |  Corresponding Angle    |Limit of Resolving Power, |      |\r\n       |        (2 _u_) for      | in Lines to an Inch.     |      |\r\n       +--------+-------+--------+--------+-------+---------+      |\r\n   (1) |  (2)   |   (3) |   (4)  |   (5)  |  (6)  |  (7)    |  (8) |  (9)\r\n  -----+--------+-------+--------+--------+-------+---------+------+------\r\n  1·33 |  ...   |180°  0′|122°  6′| 128,225| 138,989|168,907 | 1·769|  ·752\r\n  1·32 |  ...   |165° 56′|120° 33′| 127,261| 137,944|167,637 | 1·742|  ·758\r\n  1·30 |  ...   |155° 38′|117° 35′| 125,333| 135,854|165,097 | 1·690|  ·769\r\n  1·28 |  ...   |148° 42′|114° 44′| 123,405| 133,764|162,557 | 1·638|  ·781\r\n  1·26 |  ...   |142° 39′|111° 59′| 121,477| 131,674|160,017 | 1·588|  ·794\r\n  1·24 |  ...   |137° 36′|109° 20′| 119,548| 129,584|157,477 | 1·538|  ·806\r\n  1·22 |  ...   |133°  4′|106° 45′| 117,620| 127,494|154,937 | 1·488|  ·820\r\n  1·20 |  ...   |128° 55′|104° 15′| 115,692| 125,404|152,397 | 1·440|  ·833\r\n  1·18 |  ...   |125°  3′|101° 50′| 113,764| 123,314|149,857 | 1·392|  ·847\r\n  1·16 |  ...   |121° 26′| 99° 29′| 111,835| 121,224|147,317 | 1·346|  ·862\r\n  1·14 |  ...   |118°  0′| 97° 11′| 109,907| 119,134|144,777 | 1·300|  ·877\r\n  1·12 |  ...   |114° 44′| 94° 55′| 107,979| 117,044|142,237 | 1·254|  ·893\r\n  1·10 |  ...   |111° 36′| 92° 43′| 106,051| 114,954|139,698 | 1·210|  ·909\r\n  1·08 |  ...   |108° 36′| 90° 34′| 104,123| 112,864|137,158 | 1·166|  ·926\r\n  1·06 |  ...   |105° 42′| 88° 27′| 102,195| 110,774|134,618 | 1·124|  ·943\r\n  1·04 |  ...   |102° 53′| 86° 21′| 100,266| 108,684|132,078 | 1·082|  ·962\r\n  1·02 |  ...   |100° 10′| 84° 18′|  98,338| 106,593|129,538 | 1·040|  ·980\r\n  1·00 | 180°  0′| 97° 31′| 82° 17′|  96,410| 104,503|126,998 | 1·000| 1·000\r\n  0·98 | 157°  2′| 94° 56′| 80° 17′|  94,482| 102,413|124,458 |  ·960| 1·020\r\n  0·96 | 147° 29′| 92° 24′| 78° 20′|  92,554| 100,323|121,918 |  ·922| 1·042\r\n  0·94 | 140°  6′| 89° 56′| 76° 24′|  90,625|  98,223|119,378 |  ·884| 1·064\r\n  0·92 | 133° 51′| 87° 32′| 74° 30′|  88,697|  96,143|116,838 |  ·846| 1·087\r\n  0·90 | 128° 19′| 85° 10′| 72° 36′|  86,769|  94,053|114,298 |  ·810| 1·111\r\n  0·88 | 123° 17′| 82° 51′| 70° 44′|  84,841|  91,963|111,758 |  ·774| 1·136\r\n  0·86 | 118° 38′| 80° 34′| 68° 54′|  82,913|  89,873|109,218 |  ·740| 1·163\r\n  0·84 | 114° 17′| 78° 20′| 67°  6′|  80,984|  87,783|106,678 |  ·706| 1·190\r\n  0·82 | 110° 10′| 76°  8′| 65° 18′|  79,056|  85,693|104,138 |  ·672| 1·220\r\n  0·80 | 106° 16′| 73° 58′| 63° 31′|  77,128|  83,603|101,598 |  ·640| 1·250\r\n  0·78 | 102° 31′| 71° 49′| 61° 45′|  75,200|  81,513| 99,058 |  ·608| 1·282\r\n  0·76 |  98° 56′| 69° 42′| 60°  0′|  73,272|  79,423| 96,518 |  ·578| 1·316\r\n  0·74 |  95° 28′| 67° 37′| 58° 16′|  71,343|  77,333| 93,979 |  ·548| 1·351\r\n  0·72 |  92°  6′| 65° 32′| 56° 32′|  69,415|  75,242| 91,439 |  ·518| 1·389\r\n  0·70 |  88° 51′| 63° 31′| 54° 50′|  67,487|  73,152| 88,899 |  ·490| 1·429\r\n  0·68 |  85° 41′| 61° 30′| 53°  9′|  65,559|  71,062| 86,359 |  ·462| 1·471\r\n  0·66 |  82° 36′| 59° 30′| 51° 28′|  63,631|  68,972| 83,819 |  ·436| 1·515\r\n  0·64 |  79° 36′| 57° 31′| 49° 48′|  61,702|  66,882| 81,279 |  ·410| 1·562\r\n  0·62 |  76° 38′| 55° 34′| 48°  9′|  59,774|  64,792| 78,739 |  ·384| 1·613\r\n  0·60 |  73° 44′| 53° 38′| 46° 30′|  57,846|  62,702| 76,199 |  ·360| 1·667\r\n  0·58 |  70° 54′| 51° 42′| 44° 51′|  55,918|  60,612| 73,659 |  ·336| 1·724\r\n  0·56 |  68°  6′| 49° 48′| 43° 14′|  53,990|  58,522| 71,119 |  ·314| 1·786\r\n  0·54 |  65° 22′| 47° 54′| 41° 37′|  52,061|  56,432| 68,579 |  ·292| 1·852\r\n  0·52 |  62° 40′| 46°  2′| 40°  0′|  50,133|  54,342| 66,039 |  ·270| 1·923\r\n  0·50 |  60°  0′| 44° 10′| 38° 24′|  48,205|  52,252| 63,499 |  ·250| 2·000\r\n  0·45 |  53° 30′| 39° 33′| 34° 27′|  43,385|  47,026| 57,149 |  ·203| 2·222\r\n  0·40 |  47°  9′| 35°  0′| 30° 31′|  38,564|  41,801| 50,799 |  ·160| 2·500\r\n  0·35 |  40° 58′| 30° 30′| 26° 38′|  33,744|  36,576| 44,449 |  ·123| 2·857\r\n  0·30 |  34° 56′| 26°  4′| 22° 46′|  28,923|  31,351| 38,099 |  ·090| 3·333\r\n  0·25 |  28° 58′| 21° 40′| 18° 56′|  24,103|  26,126| 31,749 |  ·063| 4·000\r\n  0·20 |  23°  4′| 17° 18′| 15°  7′|  19,282|  20,901| 25,400 |  ·040| 5·000\r\n  =====+========+========+=======+========+========+========+======+======\r\n\r\n  (1) Numerical Aperture.

This accessory of the microscope\r\ninvolves the same principles as that of Tolles, which the late Mr. J.\r\nMayall and myself brought to the notice of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety of London in 1876. Abbe’s apertometer (Fig. 39) consists of a\r\nflat cylinder of glass, about three inches in diameter, and half an\r\ninch thick, with a large chord cut off, so that the portion left is\r\nsomewhat more than a semicircle; the part where the segment is cut\r\nis bevelled from above downwards, to an angle of 45°, and it will be\r\nseen that there is a small disc with an aperture in it denoting the\r\ncentre of the semicircle. To use this instrument the microscope is\r\nplaced in a vertical position, and the apertometer is placed upon the\r\nstage with its circular part to the front and the chord to the back.\r\nDiffused light, either from the sun or lamp, is assumed to be in front\r\nand on both sides. Suppose the lens to be measured is a dry one-quarter\r\ninch; then with a one-inch eye-piece having a large field, the centre\r\ndisc, with its aperture on the apertometer, is brought into focus.\r\nThe eye-piece and the draw-tube are now removed, leaving the focal\r\narrangement undisturbed, and a lens supplied with the apertometer is\r\nscrewed into the end of the draw-tube. This lens, with the eye-piece\r\nin the draw-tube, forms a low-power compound microscope. This is now\r\ninserted into the body-tube, and the back lens of the objective whose\r\naperture we desire to measure is brought into focus. In the image of\r\nthe back lens will be seen stretched across, as it were, the image of\r\nthe circular part of the apertometer. It will appear as a bright band,\r\nbecause the light which enters normally at the surface is reflected\r\nby the bevelled part of the chord in a vertical direction, so that in\r\nreality a fan of 180° in air is formed. There are two sliding screens\r\nseen on either side of the figure of the apertometer; they slide on\r\nthe vertical circular portion of the instrument. The images of these\r\nscreens can be seen in the image of the bright bands. _These screens\r\nshould now be moved so that their edges just touch the periphery of the\r\nback lens._ They act, as it were, as a diaphragm to cut the fan and\r\nreduce it, so that its angle just equals the aperture of the objective\r\nand no more.\r\n\r\nThis angle is now determined by the arc of glass between the screens;\r\nthus we get an angle in _glass_ the exact equivalent of the aperture of\r\nthe objective. As the numerical apertures of these arcs are engraved\r\non the apertometer, they can be read off by inspection. A difficulty\r\nis not infrequently experienced from the fact that it is not easy to\r\ndetermine the exact point at which the edge of the screen touches\r\nthe periphery of the back lens, or rather the limit of the aperture.\r\nZeiss, to meet this difficulty, made a change in the form of the\r\napparatus--furnished a glass disc mounted on a metal plate, with a slot\r\nfor the purpose of its more accurate adjustment.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nStereoscopic Binocular Vision.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wheatstone’s remarkable discovery of stereoscopic vision\r\nled, at no distant period, to the application of the principle to\r\nthe microscope. It may therefore prove of interest to inquire how\r\nstereoscopic binocular vision is brought about. Indeed, the curious\r\nresults obtained in the stereoscope cannot be well understood without\r\na previous knowledge of the fundamental optical principles involved\r\nin this contrivance, whereby two slightly dissimilar pictures of any\r\nobject become fused into one image, having the actual appearance of\r\nrelief. The invention of the stereoscope by Sir Charles Wheatstone,\r\nF.R.S., 1838, and improved by Brewster, was characterised by Sir John\r\nHerschel as “one of the most curious discoveries, and beautiful for\r\nits simplicity, in the entire range of experimental optics,” led to\r\na more general appreciation of the value of the conjoint use of both\r\neyes in conveying to the mind impressions of the relative form and\r\nposition of an object, such as the use of either eye singly does not\r\nconvey with anything like the same precision. When a near object having\r\nthree dimensions is looked at, a different perspective representation\r\nis seen with each eye. Certain parts are seen by the right eye, the\r\nleft being closed, that are invisible to the left eye, the right\r\nbeing closed, and the relative positions of the portions visible\r\nto each eye in succession differ. These two visual impressions are\r\nsimultaneously perceived by both eyes, and combined in the brain into\r\none image, producing the effect of perspective and relief. If truthful\r\nright-and-left monocular pictures of an object be so presented to the\r\ntwo eyes that the optic axes when directed to them shall converge at\r\nthe same angle as when directed to the object itself, a solid image\r\nwill be at once perceived. The perception of relief referred to is\r\nclosely connected with the doubleness of vision which takes place\r\nwhen the images on corresponding portions of the two retina are not\r\nsimilar. But, if in place of looking at the solid object itself we look\r\nwith the right and left eyes respectively at pictures of the object\r\ncorresponding to those which would be formed by it on the retina of the\r\ntwo eyes if it were placed at a moderate distance in front of them, and\r\nthese visual pictures brought into coincidence, the same conception of\r\na solid form is generated in the mind just as if the object itself were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nProfessor Abbe, however, contended that the method by which dissimilar\r\nimages are formed in the binocular microscope differs materially from\r\nthat of ordinary stereoscopic vision, and that the pictures are united\r\nsolely by the activity of the brain, not by the prisms which ordinarily\r\ngive rise to sensations of _solidity_. This can be only partially true,\r\nas binocularity in the microscope is due to difference of projection\r\nexhibited by the different parallax displacement of the images, and\r\nalso to the perception of depth imparted by the instrument.\r\n\r\nWheatstone was firmly convinced that his stereoscopic principle could\r\nbe applied to the microscope, and he therefore applied first to Ross\r\nand then to Powell to assist him in its adaptation. But whether either\r\nof these opticians made any attempt to give effect to his wishes\r\nand suggestions is not known. In the year 1851 Professor Riddell, of\r\nAmerica, succeeded in constructing a binocular microscope by employing\r\ntwo rectangular prisms behind the objective. M. Nachet also constructed\r\na binocular with two body-tubes and a series of prisms. But neither\r\nRiddell’s nor Nachet’s instrument was ever brought into use; they were\r\neither too complicated or too costly.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood, however, that the binocular stereoscope combines\r\ntwo dissimilar pictures, while the binocular microscope simply enables\r\nthe observer to look with both eyes at images which are essentially\r\nidentical. Stereoscopic vision, to be effective, requires that the\r\ndelineating pencil shall be equally separated, so that one portion\r\nof the admitted cone of light is conducted to one eye, and the other\r\nportion to the other eye.\r\n\r\nSelect any object lying in an inclined position, and place it in the\r\ncentre of the field of view of the microscope; then, with a card held\r\nclose to the object-glass, stop off alternately the right or left\r\nhand portion of the front lens: it will then appear that during each\r\nalternate change certain parts of the object will change their relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Portions of Eggs of Cimex.]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, Fig. 40 _a_, _b_ are enlarged drawings of a portion\r\nof the egg of the common bed-bug (_Cimex lecticularis_), the operculum\r\nwhich should cover the opening having been forced off at the time the\r\nyoung was hatched. The figures exactly represent the two positions that\r\nthe inclined orifice will occupy when the right- and left-hand portions\r\nof the object-glass are stopped off. This object is viewed as an\r\nopaque object, and drawn under a two-thirds object-glass of about 28°\r\naperture. If this experiment is repeated, by holding the card over the\r\neye-piece, and stopping off alternately the right and left half of the\r\nultimate emergent pencil, exactly the same changes and appearances will\r\nbe observed in the object under view. The two different images just\r\nproduced are such as are required for obtaining stereoscopic vision.\r\nIt is therefore evident that if instead of bringing them confusedly\r\ntogether into one eye we can separate them so as to bring together\r\n_a_, _b_ into the left and right eye, in the combined effect of the\r\ntwo projections we obtain at once all that is necessary to enable us\r\nto form a correct judgment of the solidity and distance of the several\r\nparts of the object.\r\n\r\nNearly all objectives from the one inch upwards of any considerable\r\naperture give images of the object seen from a different point of\r\nview with the two opposite extremes of the margin of the cone of\r\nrays; the resulting effect is that there are a number of dissimilar\r\nperspectives of the object blended together at one and the same time on\r\nthe retina. For this reason, if the object under view possesses bulk,\r\na more accurate image will be obtained by reducing the aperture of the\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nDiagram 3, Fig. 41, represents the method employed by Mr. Wenham for\r\nbringing the two eyes sufficiently close to each other to enable them\r\nboth to see through the double eye-piece at the same moment. _a a a_\r\nare rays converging from the field lens of the eye-piece; after passing\r\nthe eye-lens _b_, if not intercepted, they would come to a focus at\r\n_c_; but they are arrested by the inclined surfaces, _d d_, of two\r\nsolid glass prisms. From the refraction of the under incident surface\r\nof the prisms, the focus of the eye-piece becomes elongated, and falls\r\nwithin the substance of the glass at _e_. The rays then diverge, and\r\nafter being reflected by the second inclined surface _f_, emerge from\r\nthe upper side of the prism, when their course is rendered still more\r\ndivergent, as shown by the figure. The reflecting angle given to the\r\nprisms is 47-1/2°, to accommodate which it is necessary to grind away\r\nthe contact edges of the prisms, as represented, otherwise they\r\nprevent the extreme margins of the reflecting surfaces from coming into\r\noperation, which are seldom made quite perfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Professor Abbe’s Stereoscopic Eye-pieces.]\r\n\r\nFig. 42 represents a sectional view of Abbe’s stereoscopic eye-pieces,\r\nwhich consist of three prisms of crown glass, _a_, _b_ and _b′_, placed\r\nbelow the field-glass of the two eye-pieces; the tube _c_ is slipped\r\ninto the tube or body like an ordinary eye-piece. The two prisms _a_\r\nand _b_ are united so as to form a thick plate with parallel sides,\r\ninclined to the axis at an angle of 38·5°. The cone of rays from\r\nthe objective is thus divided into two parts, one being transmitted\r\nand the other reflected; that transmitted passing through _a b_ and\r\nforming an image of the object in the axial eye-piece B. Adjustment\r\nfor different distances between the eyes is effected by the screw\r\nplaced to the right-hand side of the figure, which moves the eye-piece\r\nB′, together with the prism _b′_, in a parallel direction. The tubes\r\ncan also be drawn out, if greater separation is required. The special\r\nfeature of this instrument is that on halving the cone of rays by\r\nturning the caps, an orthoscopic or pseudoscopic effect is produced.\r\nThis double-eyed piece arrangement of Abbe’s has not been at all\r\nbrought into use in this country; this is partly owing to its original\r\nadaptation for use with the shorter Continental body-tube of 160 mm.,\r\nand not for our 10-inch body.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect method of securing pleasing satisfactory stereoscopic\r\nvision of objects is that devised by Mr. Wenham. In his binocular\r\nmicroscope an equal division of the cone of rays, after passing through\r\nthe objective is secured and again united in the eye-pieces, which\r\nact as one, so that each eye is furnished with an appropriate and\r\nsimultaneous view of the object. The methods contrived by the earlier\r\nexperimenters not only materially interfered with the definition of\r\nthe objective and object, but also required expensive alterations and\r\nadaptations of the microscope, and sometimes separate stands for their\r\nemployment. Mr. Wenham’s invention, on the contrary, offers no such\r\nobstacle to its use, and the utility of the microscope as a _monocular_\r\nis in no way impaired either when using the higher powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe most important improvement, then, effected by Wenham consists in\r\nthe splitting up or dividing the pencil of rays proceeding from the\r\nobjective by the interposition of a prism of the form shown in Fig.\r\n43. This is placed in the body or tube of the microscope so as to\r\ninterrupt only one-half (_a c_) of the pencil, the other half (_a b_)\r\nproceeding continuously to the field-glass, eye-piece, of the principal\r\nbody. The interrupted half of the pencil on its entrance into the\r\nprism is subjected to very slight refraction, since its axial ray is\r\nperpendicular to the surface it meets. Within, the prism is subjected\r\nto two reflections at _b_ and _c_, which send it forth again obliquely\r\non the line _b_ towards the eye-piece of the secondary body, to the\r\nleft-hand side of the figure; and since at its emergence its axial\r\nray is again perpendicular to the surface of the glass, it suffers no\r\nfurther refraction on passing out of the prism than on entering. By\r\nthis arrangement, the image sent to the right eye is formed by rays\r\nwhich have passed through the left half of the objective; whilst the\r\nimage sent to the left eye is formed by rays which have passed through\r\nthe right half, and which have been subjective to two reflections\r\nwithin the prism, and passing through two surfaces of glass. The prism\r\nis held by the ends only on the sides of a small brass drawer, so that\r\nall the four polished surfaces are accessible, and should slide in so\r\nfar that its edge may just reach the central line of the objective, and\r\nbe drawn back against a stop, so as to clear the aperture of the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Sectional view of the Wenham Binocular.]\r\n\r\nThe binocular, then (Fig. 44), consists of a small prism mounted in\r\na brass box A, which slides into an opening immediately above the\r\nobject-glass, and reflects one-half of the rays which form an image of\r\nthe object, into an additional tube B, attached at an inclination to\r\nthe ordinary body C. One half of the rays take the usual course with\r\ntheir performance unaltered; and the remainder, though reflected twice,\r\nshow no loss of light or definition worthy of notice, if the prism be\r\nwell made.\r\n\r\nAs the eyes of different persons are not the same distance apart, the\r\nfirst and most important point to observe in using the binocular is\r\nthat each eye has a full and clear view of the object. This is easily\r\ntried by closing each eye alternately without moving the head, when\r\nit may be found that some adjustment is necessary by racking out the\r\ndraw-tubes D, E, of the bodies by means of the small milled head near\r\nthe eye-pieces; this will increase the distance of the centres; and, on\r\nthe contrary, the tubes, when racked down, will suit those eyes that\r\nare nearer together.\r\n\r\nIf the prism be drawn back till stopped by the small milled head, the\r\nfield of view in the inclined body is darkened, and the rays from the\r\nwhole aperture of the object-glass pass into the main body as usual,\r\nneither the prism nor the additional body interfering in any way with\r\nthe use of the instrument as a monocular microscope.\r\n\r\nThe prism can be withdrawn altogether for the purpose of being wiped:\r\nthis should be done frequently, and very carefully, on all four\r\nsurfaces, with a perfectly clean cambric or silk handkerchief or a\r\npiece of wash-leather; but no hard substance must be used. During this\r\nprocess the small piece of blackened cork fitted between the prism and\r\nthe thick end of the brass box may be removed; but it must be carefully\r\nreplaced in the same position, as it serves an important purpose in\r\nstopping out extraneous light.\r\n\r\nAs the binocular microscope gives a real and natural appearance to\r\nobjects, this effect is considerably increased by employing those\r\nkinds of illumination to which the naked eye is accustomed. The most\r\nsuitable are all the opaque methods where the light is thrown down\r\nupon the surface; but for those objects that are semi-transparent, as\r\nsections of bone or teeth, diatomaceæ, living aquatic animalcules, &c.,\r\nthe dark-field illumination by means of the parabolic reflector will\r\ngive an equally good result.\r\n\r\nFor perfectly transparent illumination, it is much better to diffuse\r\nthe light by placing under the object various substances, such as\r\ntissue-paper, ground glass, very thin porcelain, or a film of yellow\r\nbees’ wax, run between two pieces of thin glass.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the full advantage and relief to both eyes in prolonged\r\nobservations with high as well as low powers, and with objectives of\r\nlarge aperture, Mr. Wenham devised a compound prism for use with his\r\nbinocular microscope, the body tubes of which are also made expressly\r\nto suit the prism, as extreme accuracy is necessary to bring them\r\ninto proper position. The main prism somewhat resembles in form the\r\nordinary Wenham prism. Over the first reflecting surface is placed a\r\nsecond smaller prism, the top plane of which is parallel with the base\r\nof the first, so that direct rays pass through without deviation, but\r\nat the two inclined surfaces of the prisms (nearly in contact) there\r\nis a partial reflection from each, which, combined, give as much light\r\nas in the direct tube. The reflected image from these two surfaces\r\nis directed up into the inclined tube as usual. A somewhat later\r\nimprovement is that of Dr. Schroeder, the high power prism, by means of\r\nwhich the whole of the rays emanating from the objective pass through\r\nit, and the full aperture of any power is thereby effectively utilised.\r\nFurthermore, Messrs. Ross have also constructed a right- and left-hand\r\npair of eye-pieces, which ensure greater perfection of the image. It\r\nwas, in fact, noticed that the size of the image in the left-hand field\r\nglass slightly differed from that of the right when examined by the\r\nordinary Huyghenian eye-pieces. To compensate for this difference, the\r\nleft-hand eye-piece has been carefully calculated, and its focus is\r\nnow so accurately adjusted that the position of each eye in observing\r\nis brought into one plane of the binocular. The pairs of the several\r\nseries of eye-pieces A, B and C have also been altered, and the effect\r\nis to greatly improve the image and give increased comfort to the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, who warmly espoused the binocular, and constantly\r\nemployed it in his work, very truly said of it: “The important\r\nadvantages I find it to possess are in penetrating power, or focal\r\ndepth, which is in every way superior to that of the monocular\r\nmicroscope, so that an object whose surface presents considerable\r\ninequalities is very much more distinctly seen with the former than\r\nwith the latter.”\r\n\r\nThis difference may in part be attributed to the practical modification\r\nin the angle of aperture of the objective, produced by the division\r\nof the cone of rays transmitted through the two halves, so that the\r\npicture or image received through each half of the objective of 60° is\r\nformed by rays diverging at an angle of only about 30°. He confesses,\r\nhowever, that this does not satisfactorily explain the fact that the\r\nbinocular brings to the _mind’s_ eye the _solid_ image of the object,\r\nand thus gives to the observer a good idea of its form and which could\r\nhardly be obtained by the monocular microscope. Carpenter cites in\r\nsupport of his views the wing of a little-known moth, _Zenzera Œsculi_,\r\nwhich has an undulating surface, whereon the scales are set at various\r\nangles instead of having the usual imbricated arrangement, a good\r\nobject for demonstrating; the general inequality of surface and the\r\nobliquity of its scales, which are at once seen by the binocular with a\r\ncompleteness not obtained by the monocular instrument.\r\n\r\nTo one unaccustomed to work with the binocular the views expressed by\r\nDr. Carpenter as to the extreme value of the instrument for ordinary\r\nwork may appear somewhat exaggerated, but from my own experience,\r\nhaving long had in constant use a Ross-Zentmayer binocular, furnished\r\nwith a special prism, constructed for working with a 1/8 dry objective\r\nor a 1/10 immersion, the perfection of picture obtained was in every\r\ncase quite equal to that of the monocular microscope. The relief to the\r\neyes can hardly be over-estimated; the slight inequality of the pencil\r\nrays may be regarded rather as a part of the welcome rest afforded when\r\na prolonged examination is made; it certainly appears to me to equalise\r\nthe slight physiological difference known to exist between the eyes\r\nof most people. If one image is seen a little clearer by the stronger\r\neye, the weaker eye assists rather more the stereoscopic effect of the\r\nobject under observation. The advantage gained by the binocular is\r\nperhaps more appreciated when opaque objects are under examination,\r\nas the eggs of insects, and the tongue of the blow-fly, specimens of\r\nmosses, lichens, parasites (vegetable and animal), whose planes and\r\ninequalities of surface require penetration, and which usually demand\r\nmore time for their observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Swift-Stephenson’s Erecting Binocular.]\r\n\r\nNo variation or change of any kind proposed either in the form of the\r\ninstrument or the prism has proved of sufficient value or importance\r\nto bring it into use, and therefore Wenham’s instrument is scarcely\r\nlikely to be superseded. It must be admitted that the improvement\r\neffected in the eye-piece form by Mr. Tolles, of Boston, U.S., is\r\nan exception to the rule laid down. It consists in mounting the\r\nprisms in a light material, vulcanite, made to fit into the monocular\r\nmicroscope body, thus taking the place of the ordinary eye-piece.\r\nThe image transmitted by the objective is brought to a focus on the\r\nface of the first equilateral triangular prism by the intervention of\r\nan erector-eye-piece inserted beneath it. The second set of prisms\r\nhave a rack and pinion movement to adjust them to any visual angle.\r\nThe illumination of both fields in this eye-piece is nearly equal in\r\nbrightness. Mr. Stephenson’s erecting binocular (Fig. 45) has proved\r\nto be of some practical value. It has the advantage of being of equal\r\nuse with high and low powers, and with little loss of definition. When\r\nused for dissecting purposes it gives an erect image of the object.\r\nIt is equally useful as a working microscope, for arranging diatoms\r\nand botanical specimens of every kind. The sub-stage tube will receive\r\na diaphragm or illuminating apparatus; the eye-pieces have a sliding\r\nadjustment for regulating the widths between eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--An early form of the Ross-Wenham Binocular;\r\nnose-piece and prism-holder detached.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSimple and Compound Microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopes are known as simple and compound. The simple microscope\r\nmay, for convenience, be divided into two classes; those used in the\r\nhand (hand magnifiers), and those provided with a stand (mounted, as\r\nit is termed) for supporting the object to be viewed, together with an\r\nadjustment for the magnifying power, and a mirror for reflecting the\r\nlight through the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Visual Angle.]\r\n\r\nA _simple microscope_, mounted, is preferable to a single lens, being\r\nusually composed of two or more lenses separated by a small distance\r\non a common axis; the increase of the size of an object being the\r\nangle it subtends to the eye of the observer, or the angle formed by\r\nthe combination drawn from the axis of vision to the extremity of the\r\nobject, as in Fig. 47. The lines drawn from the eye to a and r form\r\nan angle, which, when the distance is small, is nearly twice as large\r\nas the angle from the eye to o w, formed by lines drawn at twice the\r\ndistance. This is called the angle of vision, or the visual angle.\r\nNow, the utility of a convex lens interposed between a near object and\r\nthe eye consists in its reducing the divergence of the rays forming\r\nthe several pencils issuing from it, so that they enter the eye in a\r\nstate of moderate divergence, as if they were issuing from an object\r\nbeyond the near point of distinct vision, and a well-defined image is\r\nthereby formed upon the retina. In the next Fig. (48), a double-convex\r\nlens illustrates the action of the _simple microscope_, the small\r\narrow being the object brought under view, and the large arrow the\r\nmagnified image. The rays having first passed through the lens are\r\nbent into nearly parallel lines, or pencils diverging from some point\r\nwithin the limits of distinct vision. Thus altered, the eye receives\r\nrays precisely as if they had emanated directly from a larger arrow\r\nplaced about ten inches away from it. The difference between the real\r\nand the imaginary object represents the magnifying power of the lens.\r\nThe object in this case is magnified nearly in the proportion the focal\r\ndistance of the lens bears to the distance of the object when viewed by\r\nthe unassisted eye; and this is due to the object being more distinctly\r\nviewed so much nearer to the eye than it otherwise could be without the\r\nlens.[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Virtual Image formed by Convex Lens.]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the shorter the focus and the nearer the\r\neye the magnifying lens is placed the smaller will be the diameter\r\nof the sphere of which it forms a part, and unless its aperture be\r\nproportionally reduced, the distinctness of the image will be destroyed\r\nby the spherical and chromatic aberrations of its high curvature.\r\nNevertheless, it was by the use of lenses so constructed that the older\r\nmicroscopists--of whom Leeuwenhoek was the more eminent--were enabled\r\nto do so much excellent work.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of simple pocket lenses for the most part consist of\r\na double-convex, or a plano-convex, or a combination of both, varying\r\nin focal length from a quarter of an inch to two inches. Sometimes\r\nthey are set in pairs with a hole, a small diaphragm, cut in the piece\r\nof horn placed between them. These are extremely useful for carrying in\r\nthe waistcoat pocket; to the anatomist and field botanist for examining\r\nvarious objects and preparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Wollaston’s Doublet.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important improvement effected in this form of the\r\nsimple microscope was that ascribed to the celebrated Dr. Wollaston,\r\nwho devised a doublet of two plano-convex lenses having their focal\r\nlengths, in the proportion of one to three, mounted with their convex\r\nside directed towards the eye of the observer, and the lens of shorter\r\nfocal length next the object. The explanation given of the correction\r\nthus effected in Dr. Wollaston’s doublet will be best understood\r\non reference to the annexed diagram, _l l′_, in Fig. 49, being the\r\nobject for a segment of the cornea of the eye, and _d d′_ the stop or\r\ndiaphragm. Now, it will be seen that each pencil of light proceeding\r\nfrom _l l′_, the object, is rendered excentrical by the limiting\r\naperture or the diaphragm _d d_; consequently, they pass through the\r\nlenses on opposite sides of their common axis _o p_; thus each becomes\r\naffected by opposite errors, which to some extent balance and correct\r\neach other. To take the pencil _l_, for instance, as it enters the eye\r\nat _r b_; _r b_ is bent to the right at the first lens, and to the left\r\nat the second; and as each bending alters the direction of the blue\r\nray more than the red, and as the blue ray falls nearer the margin of\r\nthe second lens, where the refraction is greater than that nearer the\r\ncentre, and compensates to some extent for the greater focal length of\r\nthe second lens, the blue rays will emerge very nearly parallel, and\r\ncolourless to the eye. At the same time, its spherical aberration has\r\nbeen diminished, since the side of the pencil as it proceeds through\r\none lens passes nearer the axis, and in the other nearer the margin.\r\n\r\nThis must be taken to apply to pencils farthest from the centre of\r\nthe object. Central rays, it is obvious, would pass both lenses\r\nsymmetrically, the same portions of rays occupying nearly the same\r\nrelative places in both lenses. The blue ray would enter the second\r\nlens nearer its axis than the red; and being thus less refracted than\r\nthe red by the second lens, some amount of compensation would take\r\nplace, differing in principle, and inferior in degree, to that which\r\nis found in the excentrical pencils. In the intermediate spaces the\r\ncorrections are still more imperfect and uncertain; and this explains\r\nthe cause of aberrations which must of necessity exist even in the\r\nbest-made doublet. It is, however, infinitely superior to a single\r\nlens, and will transmit a pencil of an angle of from 35° to 50°.\r\n\r\nThe next step towards improving the simple microscope was in relation\r\nto the eye-piece, and was effected by Holland. It consisted in\r\nsubstituting two lenses for the first in the doublet, and placing a\r\nstop between them and the third. The first bending of the pencils\r\nof light being effected by two lenses instead of one, produces less\r\nspherical and chromatic aberration, which are more nearly balanced or\r\ncorrected at the second bending, and in the opposite direction, by the\r\nthird lens.\r\n\r\nAnother form of simple lens was devised by Dr. Wollaston, the\r\n“Periscopic.” This combination consists of two hemispherical lenses\r\ncemented together by their plane faces, with a stop between them to\r\nlimit the aperture. A similar proposal, made by Sir David Brewster\r\nin 1820, is known as the Coddington lens,[19] shown at Fig. 50:\r\nthis has a somewhat larger field, and is equally balanced in all\r\ndirections, as is made evident, the pencils _a b_ and _b a_ passing\r\nthrough under precisely the same circumstances. Its spherical form\r\nhas the further advantage of rendering the position in which it is\r\nheld of comparatively little consequence. It is still used as a hand\r\nmagnifier, although its definition is certainly not so good as that\r\nof a well-made doublet. It is usually set in a folding case, as\r\nrepresented in the figure, and so contrived as to be admirably adapted\r\nfor the waistcoat-pocket. It is usually sold with the small _holder_,\r\nFig. 50_a_, for holding and securing small objects during examination.\r\nBrowning’s Platyscopic Pocket Lens is a useful form of pocket lens for\r\nthe botanist and mineralogist. Its focus is nearly three times longer\r\nthan that of the Coddington, and allows of opaque objects being more\r\neasily examined; it has also a magnifying power of 15, 20, and 30\r\ndiameters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--The Coddington Lens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50_a._]\r\n\r\nOne of the best combinations of the hand or pocket form of lens is\r\nthat known as _Steinheil’s aplanatic lens_ (Fig. 51); it consists\r\nof a bi-convex lens cemented between two concavo-convex lenses,\r\ngiving a relatively long focal distance and a large flat field. The\r\nhigher powers of this lens are much used for dissecting purposes.\r\nThis handy magnifier appears to have suggested a later combination,\r\nthe apochromatic of Zeiss. No hand lens can compare with Steinheil’s\r\n“_loups_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Steinheil’s Aplanatic Lens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Simple Microscope.]\r\n\r\nWhen the magnifying power of a lens is considerable, or when its focal\r\nlength is short, or it is wished to use it with greater precision and\r\nsteadiness, it should be mounted on a short stand with a tubular stem,\r\nwith rack-work focussing movement and mirror illumination. Fig. 52\r\nrepresents a simple dissecting microscope, with a glass circular stage,\r\n4-1/2 inches in diameter, supported on three legs--a handy and useful\r\nform of instrument for many purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Compound Microscope.\r\n\r\nThe compound microscope differs from the simple, inasmuch as the image\r\nis formed by an object-glass, and further magnified by one or more\r\nlenses forming an eye-glass. For a microscope to be a compound one,\r\nits essential qualification is that it should have an object-glass\r\nor objective, and an eye-glass or eye-piece, so called because they\r\nare respectively near the object and the eye of the observer when the\r\ninstrument is in use. The microscope consists of a tube or _body_,\r\nand a _stand_, an arrangement for carrying the _body_, combined with\r\nwhich is a _stage_ for holding the object, and a _mirror_ for its\r\nillumination. To the more modern instrument has been added a substage,\r\nto carry a condenser and other accessories.\r\n\r\nThe _body_ of a microscope, which carries the system of magnifying\r\nlenses, must be placed at one particular distance from the object,\r\ntermed the _focus_, in order that a clear image may be obtained. For\r\nthe purpose of _focussing_ two motions are supplied, the one for\r\n_coarse adjustment_, with lower powers; the other for higher powers,\r\ntermed the _fine adjustment_. It is in this wise that the magnifying\r\npower of the compound microscope is turned to good account.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, limits to the use to which lenses can be put with\r\nadvantage in the direction of magnifying the object, just as there are\r\nin varying the magnifying power of the eye-glass. Defects in either,\r\nalthough not first seen, that is, when the image is but moderately\r\nenlarged, are brought into prominence by greater amplification. In\r\npractice, therefore, it is found to be of advantage to vary the power\r\nby employing object-glasses of different values (foci). In whatever\r\nway increase of amplification is brought about, two things will always\r\nresult from the change: the proportion of surface of the object of\r\nwhich an image can be formed must be diminished, and the amount of\r\nlight spread over the image proportionally lessened.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two lenses mentioned, it was found to be of\r\nconsiderable advantage to introduce a third lens between the\r\nobject-glass and the image formed by it at eye-piece, the purport of\r\nwhich is to change the course of the rays (bend in the pencil) so that\r\nthe image may not be found of too great a dimension for the whole to\r\nbe brought within the circumference of the eye-glass. This, it will be\r\nreadily seen, allows more of the object to be viewed at the same time\r\nby the _field-glass_, as the eye-piece of the microscope is termed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nFig. 53 represents the body of an ordinary compound microscope with\r\nits triplet object-glasses; o is an object, above it is the triple\r\nachromatic object-glass, in connection with the eye-piece _e e, f\r\nf_ the plano-convex lenses; _e e_ being the eye-glass, and _f f_\r\nthe field-glass, between which, at _b b_, the arrow represents the\r\ndiaphragm. The course of the light is shown by three rays drawn from\r\nthe centre, and three from each end of the object _o_; these rays,\r\nif not prevented by the lens _f f_, and the diaphragm _b b_, would\r\nform an image at _a a_; but here, as they meet with the lens _f f_ in\r\ntheir passage, are converged by it at _b b_, the diaphragm at _b b_\r\nintercepting a portion of peripheral rays, permitting only those to\r\npass that are necessary for the formation of the image, the further\r\nmagnification of which is, however, here brought about by the eye-glass\r\n_e e_, precisely as if it were that of the original object under\r\nexamination. It will be apparent, then, that the field-lens _f f_\r\nbelongs in principle to the object-glass, or objective, taking a share\r\nin the image-forming rays, although this is taken to be a part of the\r\neye-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution of the Modern Achromatic Microscope.\r\n\r\nThe great advances made in the optical arrangements of the modern\r\nmicroscope necessitated important changes and improvements in its\r\nseveral mechanical parts. Indeed, as the apertures of objectives became\r\nincreased, and focal planes became correspondingly shallower, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to apply a more sensitive system of focussing than\r\nthat for many years past commonly in use. The leading manufacturers\r\nat once grasped the situation, and in a short space of time the older\r\nmodel microscopes were discarded, and replaced by instruments better in\r\nworkmanship and finish, and in every way more suitable for the student\r\nand the promotion of original scientific research.\r\n\r\nFrom an early period English amateurs appear to have bestowed greater\r\nattention on the improvement of the microscope than those of any other\r\ncountry. Between 1820 and 1835 Tully, Pritchard, Dolland, James Smith,\r\nAndrew Ross, and Hugh Powell, encouraged by Wollaston, Brewster,\r\nGoring, Herschel, and Lister, worked out innumerable combinations\r\nof single and compound lenses to be employed as simple microscopes,\r\nexplained in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe theories propounded about this time for the improvement of lenses\r\nand the various combinations for amateurs were not of lasting value.\r\nNevertheless, they were not wholly made in vain, as during the last\r\ntwenty years they have indirectly borne good fruit, inasmuch as by\r\nworking in another direction Professor Abbe was led to the discovery\r\nof new and better kinds of glass, by which the secondary spectrum has\r\nbeen so nearly eliminated, and the optical parts of the microscope\r\nso materially improved. In pursuing this subject I would not have it\r\nsupposed that Continental opticians were either idle or supine. On the\r\ncontrary, Oberhäuser, Fraunhofer, Chevalier, Nachet, Hartnach, and\r\nothers took an active part in the work.\r\n\r\nThe compound microscope made for anatomists by the first-named\r\noptician about 1825 has not been entirely superseded. He was the\r\nfirst to make a rotating stage, to apply mechanism to focussing, and\r\nto introduce the system of direct push or pull of the condenser tube\r\nwithin the sub-stage socket. Nachet made other improvements on the\r\nOberhäuser microscope by applying under the stage a tail-piece having a\r\ndove-tailed groove in which a slide carrying the sub-stage was moved by\r\na stud-pin. More recently the lever movement was superseded by American\r\nopticians, who made other changes. Hartnach ultimately very much\r\nimproved Oberhäuser’s model, and this remains with us.\r\n\r\nThe English modern compound microscope, together with the achromatic\r\nobjective, we owe to a mind teeming with scientific inventions,\r\nJoseph Jackson Lister, F.R.S., who in 1826 supplied Mr. Tully, a\r\nwell-known London optician of that period, with original drawings for\r\nthe important improvements in its mechanical details and accessory\r\napparatus which followed so soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nAmong the many ingenious novelties enumerated in his published papers\r\nwe find the graduated lengthening of the body-tube of the microscope; a\r\nstage-fitting for clamping and rotating the object; a subsidiary stage;\r\na dark-well, and a large disc to incline and rotate opaque objects;\r\na ground-glass light moderator; a live-box with bevelled flat-glass\r\nplate; an erector-eye-piece; an adapter for using Wollaston’s camera\r\nlucida for microscopical drawing; and, above all, a combination of\r\nlenses to act as a condenser under the object (evidently the first\r\napproach to the present achromatic sub-stage condenser). The value of\r\nthe erector-eye-piece for facilitating dissections under the microscope\r\nis not even yet sufficiently appreciated. Tully published a descriptive\r\naccount of Lister’s microscope, the first one of which he made, and\r\nacknowledged his indebtedness to “Mr. Lister’s ingenuity and skill.”\r\nShortly afterwards Lister made known his discovery of the two aplanatic\r\nfoci in a double achromatic object glass, and gave verbal directions\r\nto the three principal makers of microscopes in London, James Smith,\r\nAndrew Ross, and Hugh Powell, for the future construction of the\r\nachromatic objective, all of whom were intent on the improvement of\r\ntheir several models. To the latter the Society of Arts awarded, in\r\n1832, a medal for his improved mechanical stage movements, on the\r\n“Turrell system,” which Powell first constructed for Edmund Turrell.\r\nThis stage was made to rotate completely on its optic axis by means of\r\nan obliquely-placed pinion acting on a bevelled rack on the inner face\r\nof the stage-ring supporting the mechanism. In 1834 Powell once more\r\nreceived a Society of Arts medal, “the Iris,” for improvements in the\r\napplication of a new form of fine adjustment.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date (1835) Andrew Ross introduced the socket-carrier of\r\nthe body-tube of the microscope on a strong stem, with rack bent in the\r\nmiddle, thus affording space for a larger stage. He likewise devised\r\nthe hollow cross-bar, placed at right angles to the rack-stem, whereby\r\nhe was enabled to use a new system of fine adjustment, consisting of a\r\ndelicate screw with large milled head, acting by a point on the long\r\narm of a lever, the short arm of which ends in a fork in contact with\r\na stud placed on either side of a cylindrical sliding tube forming the\r\nnose-piece of the body-tube, and into which the objective is screwed.\r\nA spiral spring presses down the nose-piece, and against this the screw\r\nand lever act.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been the first really sensitive focussing method\r\napplied to the nose-piece; it was, and probably is, one of the most\r\ndelicate systems ever applied to the microscope. It has enjoyed a\r\nlong period of popularity, and I believe it still survives in Powell\r\nand Lealand’s instruments, which are very generally admitted to be\r\nof superior excellence for all purposes where extreme delicacy of\r\nfocussing is an essential element.\r\n\r\nThe rival system of fine adjustment--the short lever and screw applied\r\nexternally to the body-tube--known as the Lister-Jackson system, which\r\nappears to have been contrived to allow the body-tube to be supported\r\nmore firmly on the limb or stem, has had its merits ably realised in\r\nthe microscopes of Smith and Beck and their successors, but, except as\r\nmodified by the successors of Andrew Ross (Schrœder’s form), it is, I\r\nbelieve, admitted that it has been superseded by other modifications\r\nlately introduced into the Ross-Jackson instrument.\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 was, however, a propitious period in the history of the\r\nmodern microscope, as in January of that year Mr. Lister published his\r\nepoch-making paper, “On the Improvement of the Achromatic Microscope.”\r\nThis appeared together with certain personal practical directions (for\r\nno man was ever more anxious to communicate his knowledge than Mr.\r\nLister) to the before-mentioned opticians, which led up to changes\r\nlasting until 1840, when, by the efforts of this gentleman and his\r\npersonal friends, “The Microscopical Society of London” came into\r\nexistence. Among the more prominent members of the Society was Mr.\r\nGeorge Jackson, a name still well known to microscopists, and who,\r\njointly with Mr. Lister, gave us the Jackson-Lister form of microscope.\r\nThis was forthwith accepted as a perfect model. Soon after Andrew\r\nRoss effected a further change in the instrument, shown in Fig. 54 in\r\nits complete form as left by this optician. It is here represented as\r\nhaving a bar movement, with a claw foot bolted to two uprights to carry\r\nthe trunnions with the body and stage. This base, is insufficiently\r\nwide and extended to carry so large an instrument with its centre of\r\ngravity so high. The coarse adjustment bar also was rectangular, and\r\nthe fine adjustment a lever, with the milled head in the middle of\r\nthe bar, which involved a certain amount of tremor; withal it was an\r\ninstrument of excellent workmanship, and its defects were not regarded\r\nas irremediable. Messrs. Ross, however, preferred to construct an\r\nentirely new model designed by Zentmayer, the “Ross-Jackson-Zentmayer,”\r\nto which I shall refer presently. A later model, however, has to\r\nsome extent taken its place, “the Histological and Bacteriological\r\nMicroscope,” Fig. 55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--An early Ross-Jackson Microscope.]\r\n\r\nMy reference to the older form of instrument is chiefly with the view\r\nof directing attention to the sensitive focussing system, applied in\r\nthe first instance to the nose-piece; now placed below the coarse\r\nadjustment. It certainly is a delicate form of fine adjustment. This\r\nmodel possesses other points of interest well worth preserving, which\r\nfully entitle it to occupy the prominent place given in the list of the\r\nhouse of Ross. In the Ross-Jackson “Histological and Bacteriological\r\nMicroscope” much attention seems to have been given to eliminate\r\ncertain weak points in the earlier Ross-Jackson model--defects still\r\nextant in stands of certain English and foreign makers--while retaining\r\nthe more practical improvements of both constructions. Steadiness is\r\nsecured by an extension of the tripod or claw-foot and the shorter and\r\nmore solid uprights that sustain the whole weight of the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--The Ross-Jackson Histological Microscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 56.--Powell and Lealand’s Students’ Microscope, with Amici prism\r\narranged for oblique illumination, the Sub-stage and Condenser being\r\ndetached.]\r\n\r\nThe Ross-Jackson, then, survives, together with the original tripod\r\nstand of Hugh Powell’s, upon which he expended all the resources of the\r\npractical optician, and applied the early principles involved in the\r\nLister-Jackson instrument, but from different points of view. However,\r\nthere is hardly a choice between one and the other in workmanship, both\r\nopticians having furnished microscopes of a typical class and very high\r\norder. The firm of Powell and Lealand have but one form of stand, from\r\nwhich they have never been tempted to deviate. It is supported on a\r\ntrue tripod base, forming a solid and substantial support to the body,\r\nwhich is of such a length as to give as nearly as possible the standard\r\noptical interval of 10 inches between the posterior principal focus of\r\nthe objective and the anterior focus of the eye-piece; the variation\r\nin the optical tube length does not exceed a quarter of an inch with\r\nobjectives of 1/2 inch and upwards. The arm on which the body is fixed\r\nis 5-3/4 inches long, which not only gives a clearance of 3-1/2 inches\r\nfrom the optic axis, but also permits of the introduction of a long\r\nfine-adjustment lever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Powell’s larger No. 2 Instrument.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 58.--Powell and Lealand’s Students’ Microscope arranged for direct\r\nillumination. _A._ Secondary or Sub-stage racked up to bring the\r\nAchromatic Condenser close to the object.]\r\n\r\nThe cross arm encloses the lever mechanism for the fine adjustment,\r\nas originally devised by Andrew Ross. This cross arm is longer than\r\nthat used by Ross, and carries the body more forward, so as to provide\r\nradial space for the complete rotation of the stage and the optic axis,\r\nand at the same time the lever of the adjustment is lengthened, and\r\ndelicacy of motion secured. The stage retains the mechanical movements\r\ninvented by E. Turrell, and first applied by Hugh Powell. It also\r\nrotates completely by means of an obliquely placed pinion acting on\r\na bevelled rack on the inner face of the stage-ring supporting the\r\nmechanism. Finders are engraved on the plates, and the main support of\r\nthe stage-ring is graduated for angle measuring, a pointer on the ring\r\nmarking the unit of motion in arc.\r\n\r\nThe _sub-stage_ is carried by rack-work, and has rectangular centring\r\nmovements, supporting an inner socket that can be rotated by rack and\r\npinion, and which carries the several sub-stage accessories. A fine\r\nadjustment, by screw-cone and stud, is applied by means of an extra\r\nslide.\r\n\r\nThe _stage_ is attached to the sheath of the stem by a special\r\narrangement of screws, by which the rotation in the optic axis can\r\nbe centred; sliding spring clips and a movable and a removable and\r\nadjustable angle-piece to hold the slides are applied on the upper\r\nsurface. The body-tube is pivoted to move laterally on the top of the\r\nstem, and an adjustable steel stud beneath serves to stop the movement\r\nin the axis. Such is Powell’s present instrument, and it represents the\r\nresults of sixty years’ steady devotion to secure perfection, and at\r\nthe same time embody the best ideas of mechanical design by Andrew Ross.\r\n\r\nA cheaper form of students’ microscope is furnished by Powell and\r\nLealand, with 3/4-inch stage movement, coarse and fine adjustments to\r\nbody, plane and concave mirrors, revolving diaphragm, two eye-pieces,\r\nand Lister’s dark wells. These makers also adopt a gauge of tubing, the\r\nsize being such that it will take in a binocular body, a Huyghenian 2\r\ninch eye-piece having the largest field-glass possible. The tube of\r\nthe sub-stage is the same size, so as to secure one gauge of tubing\r\nthroughout. This allows of a Kellner or other eye-piece to be used as a\r\ncondenser.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoss’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ross have more recently introduced several changes and\r\nmodifications in the Zentmayer stand, all tending to improve it,\r\nso that the Ross-Zentmayer model takes its place as a first-class\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ross have lately manufactured other forms of microscopes; one\r\nespecially designed for those commencing the study of bacteriology\r\n(Fig. 59). This instrument is one of the steadiest among those lately\r\nconstructed for high-class work. The circular foot and short stout\r\npillar support the whole instrument, and a substantial knee-joint\r\nsustains the full weight in the upright or inclined positions, while\r\nthe centre of gravity is by no means disturbed, and absolute steadiness\r\nsecured. The stage is of the horse-shoe form, which affords convenient\r\nspace for the fingers to lift the slide up while the oil is placed\r\nin contact with the objective. The fine adjustment is extremely\r\nsensitive, working smoothly and direct; this is entirely covered, to\r\nprevent injury by dust. The micrometer screw works directly in the\r\ncentre of its fittings, the milled head being divided to read to 1/500\r\nof an inch. The sub-stage is fitted with a new centring coarse and fine\r\nadjustment, so that when using high powers with the Abbe condenser\r\naccurate focus can be secured with the least amount of trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Ross’s “Bacteriological and Histological”\r\nMicroscope.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of activity shown during the last few years by opticians\r\nin the manufacture of new forms of microscopes renders it somewhat\r\ndifficult to keep pace with improvements, some of which are novel. A\r\nfurther source of congratulation is that economy has all along been\r\nstudied; so much so, that the instruments in question are within the\r\nreach of persons of moderate means. Messrs. Ross and Co. have taken\r\na new departure in this respect, and their _“Eclipse” Microscope_ is\r\nan entirely new form of stand with a ring foot. This microscope has\r\nbeen produced for the especial use of students, and can be purchased\r\nfor a moderate sum. It will be seen at a glance (Fig. 60) how steady\r\nthis form of stand must necessarily be, since the centre of gravity\r\nis secured in every direction and inclination. The body-tube carries\r\neye-pieces, numbered, of the Continental size and optical tube-length\r\n(160 mm.), for which the object glasses are adjusted, and a draw-tube\r\nextending to eight inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Ross’s Rigid Pattern “Eclipse” Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe fine adjustment is independent of set screws, and not subject to\r\nderangement. It is extremely sensitive and direct in action, and from\r\nits construction is equal in perfection of working to the best that can\r\nbe made. Its fitting, by a new contrivance, is completely covered at\r\nall points, being thus preserved from disturbance or injury by dust.\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse is furnished with two eye-pieces, 1′′ and 1/4′′ object\r\nglasses of highest excellence and large angular aperture, both adjusted\r\nto a double nose-piece, so that they focus in the same plane; and a\r\nswinging mirror and stage iris diaphragm.\r\n\r\nIn “Wenham’s Radial” Microscope the chief aim has been directed towards\r\nproviding a very considerable range of effects, both in altitude and\r\nazimuth. The leading principle followed throughout in the construction\r\nof this form of stand is that of facilitating the work of the\r\nmicroscopist and of obtaining the maximum range of oblique illumination\r\nin all directions. This is fairly well attained by causing all the\r\nmovements of inclination and rotation to radiate from the object as a\r\ncommon centre. Thus it has been found possible to combine seven radial\r\nmotions, so that when the instrument is inclined backwards, as in Fig.\r\n61, or placed in the horizontal, as in Fig. 62 or rotated from in the\r\nbrass plate, a pencil of light from a fixed source shall always reach\r\nthe object and pass to the objective. The stage is made to rotate\r\ncompletely, and its rectangular motions are effected by milled heads\r\nacting entirely within the circumference. The sub-stage is mounted\r\non the Zentmayer system, with two centring screws, by means of which\r\nthe optic axis is secured. It is also provided with rectangular and\r\nrotating motions. The coarse adjustment is that of the Ross-Jackson\r\nform--a spiral pinion and diagonal rackwork, while the fine is on an\r\nentirely new principle designed by Dr. H. Schrœder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Ross’s Wenham Radial Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe “Ross-Zentmayer Microscope” is a thoroughly substantial and\r\npractical instrument, combining elegance of appearance with strength\r\nand firmness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--The Ross-Wenham Radial Microscope.]\r\n\r\nIt is a true tripod model, consisting of a triangular base with two\r\npillars rising from a cross-piece, which carries the trunnions. The\r\nslow movement is obtained by a second slide close behind the first; but\r\nto avoid the friction of rubbing surfaces, hardened steel rollers are\r\ninserted between them, which give a frictionless fine motion, amenable\r\nto the slightest touch of the milled-head screw situated conveniently\r\nat the back of the limb, through which a steel lever passes which\r\nactuates the slow motion slide. The body of the instrument is therefore\r\nnot touched during the fine focussing, so that all lateral movement\r\nis avoided. The mechanical stage rotates axially, and the outer edge\r\nof the lower plate is divided into degrees, in order to register the\r\nangles; a simple mode of adjustment is provided for setting the centre\r\nof rotation exactly coincident with the focal point of the objective.\r\nAs the plates of the stage have no screw or rackwork between them\r\n(these are placed externally), they are brought close together, thus\r\naffording the advantage of a thin substantial stage, and ensuring\r\nrigidity where most required; phosphor-bronze being used in its\r\nconstruction. The stage is attached to the limb by a conical stem, with\r\na screw and clamp nut at the back, so that it can be easily removed for\r\nthe substitution of a simple plate or other stage; by turning the stem\r\nin the socket the stage may be tilted sideways at any angle required.\r\nA feature in the Ross-Zentmayer stand is the swinging sub-stage and\r\nbar carrying the mirror, having its axis of rotation situated from an\r\naxial point in the plane of the object, which consequently receives\r\nthe light without requiring alteration of focus in any position of\r\nthe bar; by this means facilities are afforded for the resolution\r\nof objects requiring oblique light and for the development of their\r\nstructure. Rays are thus obtained from any angle and indicated by the\r\ngraduated circle round the top of the swing-bar, and many troublesome\r\nand expensive pieces of sub-stage apparatus dispensed with. The value\r\nof this arrangement was long ago recognised in Grubb’s “Sector Stand,”\r\nthe movement of which was obtained in a far less efficient manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--The Improved Ross-Zentmayer Model.]\r\n\r\nThe base or foot of the Ross-Zentmayer instrument is made in one piece.\r\nPreference must be given to the double pillar support, as this is\r\nfirmer, and allows the sub-stage to swing free while the microscope\r\nis in a vertical position, as in working with fluid preparations. The\r\nsub-stage is provided with screws for centring, and, when determined,\r\nsecured by a clamping screw.\r\n\r\nThe sub-stage, with its apparatus in place, can be instantly removed,\r\nby being drawn out sideways, so as to use the mirror alone, which is a\r\ngreat convenience.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical movements of this instrument are perfect, and well\r\nadapted to their purpose.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ross have other typical forms of microscopes. Their _“New\r\nIndustrial” Microscope_, for the use of farmers, horticulturists,\r\ntextile and other trades, for the examination of produce and raw\r\nmaterials, is a surprisingly cheap one, and deserving of commendation.\r\nThe great utility of microscopical research to purposes of advanced\r\nagriculture is fully recognised, and a less costly instrument than that\r\nusually supplied for more complex investigations was much needed. It\r\nis provided with a broad square stage for the purpose of receiving a\r\nglass dish to contain liquids or manifold objects, and which may be\r\nmoved on the stage to bring the various particles under observation.\r\nA fitting beneath the stage carries a plate with diaphragm apertures\r\nfor modifying the light, and as seeds, textile fibres, and other opaque\r\nobjects form a large portion of those to be examined, this sub-stage\r\nplate has a space between the perforations which, when brought into\r\nposition, provides a dark ground by preventing the passage of light\r\nfrom underneath. A condensing lens is, however, provided for the better\r\nlighting of opaque objects. Here we have a microscope which combines\r\nefficiency with stability, while its very simplification allows of a\r\nreally good and effective instrument for the small sum of £3 3_s._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Ross’s “New Industrial” Microscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Beck’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Beck have adopted what may be termed a rival system of fine\r\nadjustment in their modern microscopes. The short lever and screw\r\napplied externally to the body tube is peculiar, I may say, to the\r\nRoss-Jackson system, and was originally devised to allow of the body\r\ntube being supported somewhat more firmly on the limb. This change\r\nhad its merits fully realised in the early microscopes of Smith and\r\nBeck. To their successors, R. & J. Beck, the microscope owes much,\r\nand very many important improvements, while all their instruments and\r\naccessories are excellent examples of good workmanship and finish. In\r\ntheir _Pathological Microscope_ we have a movement originally found in\r\nTolles’ microscopes: a vertical disc, by which the centre can be raised\r\nor depressed to correspond with the thickness of the slide. The stage\r\ncan also be brought into an inverted position by rack and pinion. Their\r\nfine adjustment has been greatly improved, as we shall presently see,\r\nwhereby it has been made more sensitive and delicate of adjustment.\r\nThe general construction of their microscopes as a rule possess the\r\nfollowing advantages: the stands are strong, firm, and yet not too\r\nlight or too heavy, the instruments cannot alter from the position in\r\nwhich they are placed, as, unfortunately, will occasionally happen when\r\njoints work loose; in every position the heavier part of the stand\r\nmaintains the centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nBeck’s _Pathological Microscope_ (Fig. 65) is a nearly perfect\r\ninstrument, furnished with a firm triangular foot, which ensures\r\ngreat steadiness in any position. It has a well adapted joint for\r\nplacing the instrument at any angle of inclination; coarse adjustment\r\nby spiral rack and pinion; fine adjustment by delicate lever and\r\nmicrometer screw motion; rack and pinion focussing and screw centring\r\nsub-stage, made to carry all condensers and other sub-stage apparatus;\r\nmechanical stage with horizontal and vertical traversing motions. The\r\nstage is attached to the instrument by two screws and can therefore be\r\nremoved at pleasure, leaving a large square flat glass stage for the\r\nculture-plate. It is likewise provided with finder divisions, and as it\r\nalways fits on to the same place, any particular portion of the object\r\ncan be recorded and found at any moment. The triple nose-piece is a\r\nconvenient addition, and a very acceptable one to the student while\r\ndiligently engaged in histological research.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Beck’s Pathological Microscope, with square\r\nand removable stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Beck’s Large “Continental Model” Microscope.]\r\n\r\n_Beck’s Large “Continental Model” Microscope_ is of superior finish.\r\nIt is provided with a substantial horse-shoe foot, which gives support\r\nto the strong, well-balanced body, jointed for giving the microscope\r\nany angle of inclination. The body is provided with a draw-tube which\r\ncan be racked down to the Continental measurement. It has a spiral\r\nrack and pinion coarse adjustment, and a fine adjustment of the most\r\nperfect workmanship, which will be described in detail presently. It\r\nhas a large square stage with vulcanite top plate to receive culture\r\npreparations. The sub-stage is of the most approved form for centring,\r\nand carries an achromatic or Abbe condenser, iris diaphragm, &c. The\r\ndouble mirror can be swung out of place for direct illumination and\r\nmicro-photography. Altogether, this instrument is in every way fitted\r\nfor critical or class-room work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Beck’s “New Fine Adjustment.”]\r\n\r\nTo return to the fine adjustment of this, as of other forms of Messrs.\r\nBeck’s microscopes, the applied mechanism of which is believed to be\r\none of the most sensitive and delicate character yet contrived. It\r\nis constructed as shown in the accompanying figure. The body of the\r\ninstrument is supported upon the barrel D D; this barrel is accurately\r\nand smoothly fitted to the triangular core E E. At the top of barrel D\r\nD is screwed the cap G, to which is attached the rod C; this rod passes\r\nthrough the centre of the core E E and connects with the lever arm A at\r\nB. The action of the spring J, which is wrapped spirally around the rod\r\nC, raises the body of the microscope and holds the lever arm A tightly\r\nagainst the screw arm F. The slightest motion, therefore, of the screw\r\nF is communicated through the lever A and the rod C to the body of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThe great delicacy of this arrangement will be appreciated when it\r\nis noticed that the distance from I H is double the distance of I B,\r\ntherefore any motion at B is only half that at H. This adjustment is\r\none of the most delicate made for use with high powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Beck’s National Binocular Microscope.]\r\n\r\nIn the construction of Beck’s Binocular National Microscope, the body\r\nis held in a sliding fitting in the limb, and is moved up or down\r\nby means of a rack and pinion motion. This constitutes the coarse\r\nfocussing adjustment. The fine adjustment is effected by the milled\r\nhead, which acts upon the body by means of a lever inside the limb.\r\nThe upper circular surface of the stage is made of glass, and carries\r\nthe object holder, which is provided with a ledge and spring to hold\r\nthe object by means of the pressure of an ivory-tipped screw, so that\r\nit can be moved about readily and smoothly. The pressure of the screw\r\nis adjusted by the milled head, which permits of more or less pressure\r\nbeing made upon the edge of the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Beck’s Star Microscope.]\r\n\r\nWhen the stage is required for other purposes the object holder can be\r\nunscrewed and removed. Beneath the stage there is a cylindrical fitting\r\nfor the reception of a diaphragm, a polariser, or other apparatus. The\r\nmirror, besides swinging in a rotatory semi-circle, is made to slide\r\nup or down the stem. The microscope is supported by a firm pillar on a\r\ntripod base, and the body can be inclined at any angle convenient for\r\nworking. A sub-stage can be added at any time for the reception of an\r\nachromatic condenser fitted with concentric screws--a necessity for\r\nmore delicate microscopical research work.\r\n\r\n_Beck’s Star Microscope_ is in every sense a students’ or class-room\r\ninstrument. It is firm and well made, with joint for inclination,\r\nlarge square stage, sliding coarse adjustment and fine adjustment by\r\nmicrometer screw, draw-tube, iris diaphragm, double mirror on swinging\r\ncrank arm, A or B eye-piece, a one-inch and quarter-inch objective, the\r\nmagnifying power of which ranges from 38·5 to 183.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Beck’s Binocular Dissecting Microscope.]\r\n\r\nAn early binocular microscope for dissecting purposes was devised\r\nby the late Mr. R. Beck. (Fig. 70.) This took the form of a simple\r\ninstrument built up on a square mahogany base A raised about four\r\ninches upon four brass supports B B, having a large circular stage\r\nplate made to revolve on a second plate, on which the object is placed\r\nand brought under the eye for dissection. On the left hand side is a\r\nmilled head rack and pinion K, which acts upon a horizontal bar I for\r\nfocussing the magnifying lens. Another bar, R, carries the prism P and\r\na pair of eye-pieces arranged on the principle of M. Nachet’s binocular\r\nmicroscope. Mr. Beck preferred to adopt Wenham’s method of arranging\r\nthese prisms; that is, by allowing half the cone of rays to proceed to\r\none eye without interruption, while the other half is intercepted by\r\nthe prisms and transmitted to the other eye. Beneath the stage is the\r\nordinary mirror L. The condensing lens M is supported on a separate\r\nbrass holder let into one of the supports of the stand. In practice,\r\nhowever, this arrangement was found inconvenient, and the microscope\r\nhas therefore not been brought into general use.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Watson’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\nAmong London opticians, the various microscopes manufactured by Messrs.\r\nWatson, of Holborn, are of high finish and good workmanship. Those\r\nspecially designed for the use of students possess merits of their\r\nown in their mechanical construction, and also embody a provision,\r\nas indeed do all their instruments, whether for students or more\r\npretentious work, whereby wear and tear in their frictional parts\r\ncan be compensated for by the user himself. This is effected in a\r\nsimple but efficient manner. The fittings are sprung, and screws set\r\njust outside the dove-tails. The very slightest turn of the screws\r\ncompresses the dove-tails, and a very large amount of wear can in this\r\nway be prevented.\r\n\r\nI am glad to notice that Messrs. Watson have adopted certain standard\r\nsizes recommended some time ago by the Royal Microscopical Society for\r\nthe diameters of eye-pieces. It would be a great advantage if the same\r\nstandard became generally recognised and brought into use, since it is\r\na matter of much importance to microscopists.\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Edinburgh Students’ Microscope_ (Fig. 71) is a thoroughly\r\nefficient one for all practical purposes, great care having been\r\nbestowed upon its smallest details, and it is not difficult to perceive\r\nthe reason of its popularity among students. The tripod form of foot\r\nensures great steadiness and firmness; the body carries the smaller\r\n0·92 eye-piece, and with draw-tube closed is of the Continental length.\r\nThe draw-tube is graduated to millimetres, and when fully extended the\r\nbody measures 10 inches. The stage is provided with mechanical and\r\nrotary movements; the compound sub-stage with centring screws, rack\r\nand pinion to focus, and a means of lifting the condenser out of the\r\noptical axis when not required for use. Notwithstanding, none of the\r\nmovements are at all cramped; a clear distance is maintained beneath\r\nthe stage, affording plenty of room for manipulating the mirror. Both\r\ncoarse and fine adjustments work with smoothness, the latter being on\r\nWatson’s latest improved principle--one revolution of the milled head\r\nmoves the body 1/300 of an inch. The stage is of extra large size,\r\nto allow of the use of large culture-plates. No Continental stand of\r\nhigher price compares with the Edinburgh microscope. Its height when\r\nplaced in the vertical position is 11-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Watson’s Edinburgh Students’ Microscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 72.--Sub-stage of Edinburgh Students’ Microscope. This view of\r\nunderside of stage of students’ instrument shows the mirror set at an\r\nangle for oblique illumination, and sub-stage turned aside.]\r\n\r\nThe various sizes of oculars adopted by opticians and at present in\r\nvogue cause considerable confusion. A standard size is specially\r\nneeded for students’ and small microscopes. The standard long used by\r\nContinental manufacturers is 0·92 of an inch. The adoption of this size\r\nwould place the eye-piece in the same position as that of the universal\r\nscrew for the objective, formulated by the Royal Microscopical Society\r\nmany years ago. The desirability of using standard sizes has been fully\r\nrecognised by Messrs. Watson and they are now adapted to most of their\r\nmicroscopes. The English diameter, 1·35 of an inch, known as the “Ross”\r\nsize, is retained in all their microscopes of large size.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatson’s Mechanical Draw-tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Watson’s Mechanical Draw-tube (full-size).]\r\n\r\nAn important feature in connection with the body-tube of Watson’s\r\nEdinburgh Students’ Microscope (as, indeed, in all their fully\r\nfurnished instruments) is that they are provided with two draw-tubes;\r\none moved by rack-work, the other sliding inside the body-tube. The\r\nadvantage is, that the body can be made very short or extremely long,\r\nwhile sufficient latitude can be given to objectives corrected for\r\neither Continental or English tube-lengths, and to adjusting the same\r\nfor thickness of cover-glass by variation of tube length. Should the\r\ncover-glass be thicker than that for which the objective is corrected,\r\na shorter tube-length is necessary; if thinner, the body must be\r\nlengthened. This is effected by means of the rackwork draw-tube. The\r\nlength of the body when closed is 142 millimetres (5-5/8 inches), and\r\nwhen the two draw-tubes are extended, 305 millimetres (12 inches),\r\nbeing, therefore, shorter than the Continental and longer than the\r\nEnglish tube lengths. Both draw-tubes are divided into millimetres,\r\nand on the rackwork draw-tube a double scale is engraved, reading\r\ncontinuously from the sliding draw-tube when fully drawn out, or\r\ngiving the body length when the rackwork draw-tube alone is in use.\r\nThe utility of this mechanical draw-tube is that it permits of quick\r\nmanipulation with perfect results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Watson’s Histological Microscope. Stand\r\n“A.”--Height, when placed vertically and tube pushed home, 9-1/2\r\ninches.]\r\n\r\nThe inside top of the draw-tube is smaller than the remainder, the\r\nformer making a fitting for the eye-piece about 1 inch long, permitting\r\nof the tube being blackened inside up to this fitting, thus minimising\r\nreflection. The end of the draw-tube has the universal screw for using\r\nthe apertometer, &c.\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Histological Microscope_ (Fig. 74) is a somewhat cheaper\r\nform of instrument, designed for the student; although of plainer\r\nconstruction it is quite as well made as the costlier model. It is\r\nprovided with spiral rack and pinion coarse adjustment, and with this\r\nmotion the greatest smoothness is preserved. There is no backlash, the\r\nteeth of the pinion never leaving the rack; so effective is it that a\r\nhigh power can be perfectly focussed by its means. It is also furnished\r\nwith their universal pattern of fine adjustment. This can be had for £3\r\n3_s._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Watson’s Semi-Mechanical Stage.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Watson have among other accessories of value introduced in\r\nconnection with their several microscopes a semi-mechanical stage,\r\nwhereby they are enabled to reduce the cost of manufacture. Fig. 75 is\r\nan outline sketch of the same.\r\n\r\nThis stage is of the horse-shoe shape, with cut-out centre, constructed\r\nof 1/4-inch brass plate, and measures over all 5-1/4 inches wide by 4\r\ninches deep. Fitting on the edges of the main stage is a frame which is\r\nactuated vertically by means of a double rack and pinion from beneath,\r\ngiving 3/4-inch of movement, having controlling heads on either side\r\nof the stage; on the edges of this mechanical frame a sliding bar is\r\nfitted, consequently movement may be imparted either by rackwork or\r\nby hand. The mechanical movement, however is in one direction only;\r\nbut as the bar carries the object, the worker can easily move the\r\nobject out horizontally with the finger. The advantage of this stage\r\nis that the whole surface is perfectly flush, and the pinion heads are\r\nbelow its level, so that culture plates or continuous sections may be\r\nconveniently examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--New Centring Underfitting for Microscope.]\r\n\r\nAnother addition of considerable value is the centring underfitting for\r\nstudents’ microscopes.\r\n\r\nThis fitting places in the hands of student workers a means of\r\naccurately centring the sub-stage condenser, at a low cost. It consists\r\nof the usual underfitting tube, having a flange at the top which is\r\nfitted in a box between two plates. The centring is effected by means\r\nof two screws, which press the flange against a spring, as in the\r\nordinary sub-stage centring movement. The fitting can be adapted to any\r\nform of Messrs. Watson’s and most other makers of students’ microscopes.\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Bacteriological Improved Van Heurck’s Microscope_ (Fig.\r\n77) is in every way a superior instrument, and it at once conveys a\r\nfavourable impression to the practical worker. When set up for use its\r\nmany convenient points--its excellence of workmanship and the precision\r\nof its movements--seem to imply its special adaptation for the\r\nbacteriological laboratory and for other high-class work where absolute\r\nreliance has to be placed in the results obtained. Every detail of\r\nthe instrument is carried out in the best possible manner. The coarse\r\nadjustment is effected by means of a diagonal rack and spiral pinion,\r\nwhich ensures the smoothest possible motion; while the fine, the most\r\nimportant movement in the instrument, is made with an extra long lever,\r\na specialty of Messrs. Watson’s, and which imparts an extremely slow\r\naction: this is now one of the most delicate and reliable forms of\r\nfine adjustment. By its means the entire body is raised or lowered\r\nby means of a milled head fixed to a screw having a hardened steel\r\npoint acting on a lever against a point attached to the body slide, in\r\na dove-tailed fitting about 2-1/2 inches long. Owing to the position\r\nof the controlling milled head on the limb, it can be worked with\r\neither hand. Another feature of importance is that, in using the fine\r\nadjustment the distance between the eye-piece and objective remains\r\nunaltered. All the frictional parts of the microscope have spring slots\r\nto the dove-tailed fittings, in which compensating screws are fitted.\r\nThese are some few of the more important points, to which much thought\r\nand attention have been given. The body permits also of the use of\r\nobjectives of any other optician, since its total length when the draw\r\ntubes are closed up is only 143 mm.; when extended, a total length of\r\n320 mm. is available. By this means an ample margin is left for the\r\ncorrection for cover-glass thickness, whether the objective used be\r\nintended for the 160 mm. or 250 mm. tube length. The height of the\r\nmicroscope when placed in the vertical position is 13-1/8 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Watson’s Improved “Van Heurck Bacteriological”\r\nMicroscope.]\r\n\r\n_The Stage._--A somewhat new design has been used in building this up\r\nso as to reduce vibration to a minimum. The bracket carrying the stage,\r\ninstead of being screwed on to the front of the limb, as is usually\r\ndone, is made in a solid casting, taking the sub-stage beneath, and\r\npassing into the joint at the top of the foot. The joint bolt goes\r\nthrough the whole (limb and stage bracket), rendering the limb stage\r\nand sub-stage as firm as if it were one piece; a point of considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors, which are plain and concave, are mounted on a swing arm,\r\nso that they may be turned aside when direct illumination of the object\r\nis required. On the right hand side also there is a steel clamping bar\r\nfor fixing the microscope at any angle of inclination. The tripod foot,\r\nwhich has superseded most other forms, is adopted. At the points of\r\ncontact with the table the feet are provided with cork pads, which give\r\nincreased firmness and prevent vibration to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe sub-stage is provided with a fine adjustment of similar design to\r\nthat employed for the focussing of the objective. It has become needful\r\nto embody such a refinement, in order that sub-stage condensers of\r\nlarge aperture, such as are in constant use for critical high-power\r\nwork, may be adjusted with the same facility and precision as the\r\nobjective--they, in fact, require it if the best work is to be got\r\nout of them. No pains have been spared by Messrs. Watson to render it\r\nabsolutely perfect.\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Portable Microscope._--This instrument is similar in general\r\ndetail to the Histological Microscope, but the foot, mirror stem,\r\n&c., are made to fold up in exceedingly compact form, and when set up\r\nfor use the stand is perfectly rigid. Portable microscopes are, as a\r\nrule, but makeshifts. This, however, is a thoroughly sound, practical\r\ninstrument and capable of best work with the highest power objectives,\r\nhaving good adjustments and universal size fittings throughout, so that\r\nthe objectives and apparatus made for the larger instruments can be\r\nemployed with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Watson’s Portable Microscope. Height of\r\ninstrument when placed vertically and racked down is 9-3/8 inches.]\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Petrological Microscope_ (Fig. 79) is a modification of their\r\nEdinburgh Students’ pattern, and designed specially for petrological\r\nand mineralogical work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Students’ Petrological Microscope.]\r\n\r\nA polariscope having prisms of large size is supplied with it, the\r\nanalyser being fitted in the body, and the polariser in the under-stage\r\nfitting. The latter has a divided circle and a spring catch at every\r\nquarter circle. By removing the polariser and withdrawing the analyser,\r\nfor which provision is made, the microscope can be used for purposes\r\nof ordinary research. A Klein’s quartz plate is fitted beneath the\r\nanalyser, also in the body of the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe stage, which has a glass surface, rotates concentrically, and has\r\na divided circumferential edge reading by the verniers. The eye-piece\r\nhas cross webs to the diaphragm, and when it is desired, an analyser,\r\nhaving a divided circle fitted with a calc-spar plate, can be used\r\nabove the eye-piece, and condenser lenses attached to the polariser for\r\nstereoscopic purposes. All the fittings have the universal thread, and\r\nare interchangeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Swift’s Histological and Physiological\r\nMicroscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Swift’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Swift’s Microscopes_ have a well-established reputation for\r\nquality and good workmanship, and therefore can in no way suffer\r\nby comparison when placed beside those of other opticians. One of\r\nthe characteristics of Messrs. Swift’s microscopes--and this runs\r\nthrough the whole series--is that they are all made to a _standard_\r\ngauge, so that the several parts of the instruments, as well as their\r\naccessories, are interchangeable; the cheaper forms, with those of the\r\nfirst quality and finish. Should the student, then, start with a No. 1\r\nmodel, he can at any time build it up, as it were, with the accessories\r\ndesigned for a No. 3 or 4, that is, for an instrument of double the\r\nprice he started with. The optical centre is preserved throughout the\r\nwhole series of microscopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Swinging Leg Attachment of Swift & Son’s\r\nFour-Legged Microscope Stand.]\r\n\r\nThe tripod foot has, it appears, taken the place of some of their other\r\nforms of instruments, while their four-legged _tripod_, if it can be so\r\ndesignated, is a novelty of quite an unusual character.\r\n\r\nThe swing leg is attached to the framework of the tripod by the screw\r\n(Fig. A), which is provided with a powerful steel spiral spring,\r\ncompressed between two steel collets when the screw is driven home, as\r\nshown in Fig. B.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of this spring will obviously take up and compensate\r\nautomatically any wear and tear that is likely to occur between the\r\nbearing surfaces, and it is therefore impossible for the fitting to get\r\nloose.\r\n\r\n_Swift’s Four-legged Microscope_ (Fig. 80) is one possessing great\r\nstability in whatever position it may be placed; the body being\r\nsupported on a horse-shoe platform, from which its four legs spring,\r\nthe two front legs being fixed, while the hind legs are pivoted to\r\nthe platform. This arrangement of pivoting the hind legs enables\r\nthe microscope to adapt itself to any uneven surface, thus keeping\r\nit always in a steady position, while it also reduces the danger of\r\nbeing upset by any lateral movement of an accidental nature. The feet\r\nare studded with corks, an additional aid to steadiness and fixity\r\nfor microphotography. The length of the body from the ocular to the\r\nnose-piece is 6-1/2 inches, and can be extended to 9 or 10 inches by\r\nmeans of the draw-tube, which has a millimetre graduation. The stage,\r\nwhich is of horse-shoe shape, is provided with spring clips, to which\r\na movable mechanical stage can at any time be attached. The sub-stage\r\npartakes of two forms, one being an ordinary fitting, taking an\r\nordinary condenser; the other, the regular rack and pinion achromatic\r\ncondenser with centring adjustments. It has a diagonal rack and pinion\r\ncoarse adjustment, the fine adjustment being made by micrometer screw\r\nof the finest character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Swift’s Spiral Rack and Pinion Coarse\r\nAdjustment.]\r\n\r\nFig. 82 is intended to illustrate the advantage of the spiral rack\r\nand pinion which Messrs. Swift fit to their microscopes, in place of\r\nthe ordinary conventional horizontal rack and pinion movement. The\r\nadvantage will at once be seen, since there is more gearing contact\r\nbetween rack and pinion, thus ensuring durability and reducing loss of\r\ntime or back lash to a minimum, with less wear and tear. The leaves of\r\nthe pinion also roll into the teeth of the rack by degrees, ensuring a\r\nvery much smoother action, which, if properly made and fitted, prevents\r\nthe gearing of the two being felt by the hand whilst focussing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Graduated Supplementary Draw-Tube.]\r\n\r\nFig. 83 is a supplementary draw-tube with rack and pinion movement,\r\nwhich can be adapted to any of Swift’s microscopes in place of\r\nthe ordinary draw-tube, the size of the thread being of the same\r\ndiameter, so as to render all draw-tubes, as well as other parts\r\nof these instruments, interchangeable. The draw-tube being divided\r\ninto millimetres can be extended from 160 to 250 millimetres. One\r\nadvantage of this arrangement is that the correct adjustment of any\r\nobjective with each eye-piece is easily found and recorded for future\r\nobservations with the same combination.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Swift’s Three-legged Tripod Microscope (Fig. 86). In most\r\nrespects the description already given of the four-legged instrument\r\nis applicable to this stand. Although of an apparently different form,\r\nit can be built up, as already explained, into one of a higher class.\r\nIt is suitable in every way for histological investigations. The\r\nhorse-shoe platform in this, as in the preceding stand, is extremely\r\nserviceable, as it allows the pillar of the instrument to rest firmly\r\nupon it, thus rendering the stand very rigid.\r\n\r\n_Swift’s Bacteriological Microscope_ (Fig. 84), designed by Professor\r\nWright, of the Army Medical School, Netley, a sufficient warranty of\r\nits excellency and perfect adaptation for bacteriological high-class\r\nwork. One of the advantages connected with this microscope is the\r\nfacility with which it can be adapted for either high or low power\r\ninvestigation, without the necessity of adding or detaching any part.\r\nThe objectives, arranged on a triple nose-piece, are approximately in\r\nfocus when revolved into position for immediate use, thus effecting\r\na saving of time in changing the objective. Moreover, the nose-piece\r\ncarrying the objectives is of new construction, and fitted in such a\r\nway that the entry of dust is rendered impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Swift’s Army Bacteriological Microscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Under-Stage of same.]\r\n\r\nThe Abbe condenser, fitted with an iris diaphragm, is mounted on\r\nan eccentric arm, so that it can readily be thrown out of the axis\r\nof the microscope when not required, without having to re-arrange\r\nthe focus when again brought into position. The condenser must be\r\nturned aside when plate cultivations and preparations of unstained\r\nbacteria are being looked over for selection of colonies for mounting,\r\nin which case an arm carrying a quadrant with three apertures is\r\nbrought into position in place of the condenser, the apertures being\r\nseverally centred by a spring catch and used with oblique light. This\r\narrangement, shown in Fig. 85, is seen from the under surface of the\r\nstage. The stage is sufficiently large, so that when Petrie plates\r\nare being examined at the extreme edges there is little fear of their\r\noverbalancing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Swift’s Histological Students’ Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe fine adjustment is the Swift’s Patent Campbell Differential Screw,\r\nwhich offers great facilities for delicate focussing with the highest\r\npower objectives. The stand is of the most substantial and rigid form,\r\nand thus ensures the microscope from vibration.\r\n\r\nThe under-stage of microscope (Fig. 85) is seen to be of the most\r\napproved form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--Swift’s Advanced Students’ Microscope.]\r\n\r\n_Swift’s Advanced Students’ Microscope._--In this microscope (Fig. 87)\r\nwe have a superior instrument for the use of the advanced student,\r\nwhich may be described as of high mechanical excellence, well suited\r\nfor every requirement of work. The stand is the well-known tripod\r\nform of their Challenger Microscope, and admits of the instrument\r\nbeing placed at any angle of inclination; the body is short enough\r\nto work with objectives of Continental makers, and is provided with\r\na draw-tube, to elongate it to the standard of 10 inches, with a\r\ndiameter of 1-3/16 inch to take the same eye-pieces as the larger\r\nstands. The coarse adjustment is by spiral rack and pinion; the fine,\r\nby a carefully made differential screw motion for delicate focussing.\r\nThe stage is of the horse-shoe pattern, to which a mechanical stage\r\ncan at any time be adapted, as well as an achromatic condenser to the\r\nsub-stage seen beneath. Here the student will find the foundation for a\r\nsuperior instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Baker’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\nOf Messrs. Baker’s larger stands, the Improved “Nelson Model,” No. 2\r\n(Fig. 88) stand is selected in preference to their more elaborate No.\r\n1, and their simpler form, No. 3, as a high-class instrument, and one\r\nwell suited for fine critical work; the former being somewhat better,\r\nonly from having extra adjustments; the latter possessing no superior\r\nadvantage over the “Advanced Students’” Microscope. This microscope\r\nis mounted on a solid tripod foot, which insures stability, whether\r\nplaced in a vertical, horizontal, or inclined position; the front\r\ntoes are slotted, so that they may be clamped to the base plate of a\r\nphoto-micrographic apparatus, first introduced for photo-micrographic\r\nwork, and will also be found convenient in ordinary work; as the fine\r\nadjustment milled head is placed at the bottom of the pillar, instead\r\nof at the top, the more usual place. For photo-micrographic work the\r\nadvantage is that the strain of the pulley in such apparatus actuates\r\nthe fine adjustment, and is less liable to cause vibration of the\r\ninstrument. The advantage when the instrument is used for ordinary\r\nwork lies in the fact that the weight of the hand is rested on the\r\ntop of the tripod, thus admitting of steadier movement of the milled\r\nhead. The fine adjustment is obtained by a “Campbell” differential\r\nscrew, each revolution of which is equal to 1/200 m.m. The draw-tubes\r\nbeing graduated in m.m., allow of either short or long tube objectives\r\nbeing used, closing up to 150 m.m. and extending to 280 m.m., the rack\r\nand pinion adjustment to the lower tube affording a ready means of\r\ncorrection for cover-glass thicknesses. The eye-piece gauge, as will\r\nbe seen from its dimensions, is of large size, being the same as\r\nthat adopted by Zeiss for his long tube compensating oculars; smaller\r\neye-pieces can, however, be adapted at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 88.--Baker’s Improved “Nelson Model” Microscope.\r\nDimensions.--Height when in vertical position and body racked down,\r\n11′′; Height of stage, 4-1/8′′; Height of optic axis when in horizontal\r\nposition, 8-1/2′′; Spread of tripod foot, 8 × 8-1/2′′; Diameter of\r\nmirrors, 2-3/8′′; Internal diameter of draw-tube, 1-3/10′′.]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical rotating stage is divided on brass to 1/100 inch, with\r\nclamping bars and stop, by which a specimen can always be brought back\r\nto a certain position for registration. The sub-stage has rack-work\r\nfocussing adjustment, and centring screws; a fine adjustment is added,\r\nif desired. On the whole, the instrument is suitable for special\r\ncritical work, and is equally well suited for photo-micrography.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 89.--Baker’s Advanced Students’ Microscope. Dimensions.--Height\r\nwhen in vertical position and body racked down, 11-1/4′′; Height of\r\nstage, 4-3/4′′; Width of stage, 4′′; Height of optic axis when in\r\nhorizontal position, 6-1/2′′; Spread of foot, 6′′ × 6′′; Diameter of\r\nmirrors, 1-3/4′′; Internal diameter of draw-tube, 11/12′′.\r\n\r\nExplanatory lettering of instrument: A, Huyghenian eye-piece;\r\nB, draw-tube graduated in millimetres; C, nose-piece; D, coarse\r\nadjustment; E, fine adjustment with millimetre screw; F, horse-shoe\r\nsliding stage, graduated with sliding bar in vertical and horizontal\r\ndirections _for use as finder_; G, sub-stage rack and pinion screw;\r\nH and I, centring screws to sub-stage; J, carrier for condenser; K,\r\nmirror with movable arm supported on solid tripod foot.]\r\n\r\nThe points of difference between this stand and the No. 1 model are\r\nthat in the latter the fine adjustment carries the body only, and\r\nnot the rack adjustment; the limb carrying both the body and the\r\nsub-stage is in one piece, giving, if possible, still greater rigidity;\r\nthe rotation of the mechanical stage, which is divided on silver, is\r\ncomplete, and can be actuated by hand or rack work; it has a clamping\r\nscrew and fine adjustment to sub-stage.\r\n\r\n_Baker’s Advanced Students’ Microscope_ (Fig. 89) may be described as\r\na typical instrument, equally suitable for histological work and that\r\nof the advanced student. The intention of the maker in simplifying\r\nthe adjustments and reducing the instrument in size, was to furnish a\r\nwell-finished portable instrument at a moderate cost. This object has\r\nnot been attained by supplying adjustments of second-rate quality, but\r\nby reducing their number to a minimum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--The Mayall Removable Mechanical Stage.]\r\n\r\nThe tripod foot of the “Nelson Model” is replaced by a claw foot,\r\nwhich is in effect a tripod, as it rests on three points; it has\r\nnot the same wide spread, but this, far from being a disadvantage,\r\nrenders the instrument more portable. It has rack and pinion coarse\r\nand Campbell differential screw fine adjustments, draw-tube graduated\r\nin m.m., extending to 180 m.m., eye-piece gauge the same as the\r\nContinental size, large square open stage to afford the greater freedom\r\nof manipulation; sliding bar with graduations on bar and stage, which\r\nsuffice for registering any given field under a low power; holes are\r\nalso drilled in the stage ready to receive an attachable mechanical\r\nstage should it be thought advisable to add one at a later date.\r\nThe sub-stage is of the universal size with rack-work focussing,\r\nadjustment, and centring screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 91.--Baker’s Model Histological Microscope. Dimensions.--Height\r\nwhen in vertical position and body racked down, 10-1/2′′; Height of\r\nstage, 4′′; Width of stage, 3-1/2′′; Height of optic axis when in\r\nhorizontal position, 5-1/4′′; Spread of foot, 5-1/4′′; Diameter of\r\nmirrors, 1-5/8′′; Internal diameter of draw-tube, 11/12′′.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Baker have recently introduced a similar instrument with\r\nswing-out sub-stage and adjustments for compensating for wear and tear\r\nof rack. The stage is also somewhat larger from back to front.\r\n\r\nThese stands are very suitable for bacteriological research, and for\r\namateurs wishing to obtain a stand which will carry all the apparatus\r\nthey are likely to need, without going to the expense of the larger\r\nmodels, no better instrument could be desired.\r\n\r\nTheir “Removable Mechanical Stage” (Fig. 90) is a modification of the\r\npattern designed by the late Mr. J. Mayall. The vertical movement is\r\nby rack and pinion, giving a range of 1-1/8 inch. The horizontal motion\r\nof 1-1/2 inch is accomplished by means of a quick-acting screw. The\r\nobject is pressed tightly to the stage of the microscope by means of\r\nthree points, and the whole of the mechanical part is firmly clamped\r\nby two thumb screws which can be readily removed. The stage is made to\r\ncarry slides of any size less than 1-3/4 inch wide.\r\n\r\n_Baker’s Histological Microscope_ (Fig. 91) is of a different type\r\nto the preceding, and is intended to represent one of medium power,\r\naffording magnification of about × 400 as a maximum. It is supplied\r\nwith a diaphragm beneath the stage, without other illuminating\r\napparatus than that of the mirror. But if the adjustments of such a\r\nstand are good, there is no reason why some form of sub-stage condenser\r\nshould not be added, to make the instrument somewhat more serviceable.\r\nThere is, however, a rather too limited space beneath the stage of an\r\ninstrument of this kind to admit of a sub-stage condenser, consequently\r\nit cannot be said to be suitable for critical work. For all ordinary\r\nstudents’ work this microscope is certainly available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Rousselet’s Tank Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe stand of the Model Histological Microscope has the same form of\r\nfoot as the more advanced student’s stand. It is somewhat lighter, and\r\nmore portable, a matter of consideration in a student’s microscope,\r\nwhich often has to be carried to and from a class-room. It is provided\r\nwith rack and pinion coarse adjustment, and a Campbell differential\r\nscrew fine adjustment, draw-tube, and diaphragm; the diaphragm carrier\r\nbeing of the universal size, so that it can be replaced by an Abbe\r\ncondenser at any time. With the additions suggested, this instrument\r\ncan be made equal to those of a higher standard.\r\n\r\nRousselet’s Tank Microscope (Fig. 92), for rapidly looking over pond\r\nwater and weeds, consists of a jointed arm moving parallel to the side\r\nof the tank to carry an aplanatic lens; the arm is focussed by means of\r\nrack and pinion fixed to the upright of a mahogany stand, upon which\r\nthe tank can be placed, or it can be clamped directly to the tank by\r\nmeans of a screw. This handy form of pond microscope is made by Messrs.\r\nBaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nPillischer’s Microscopes.\r\n\r\nMr. Pillischer (New Bond Street) is favourably known for the excellency\r\nof his instruments. He has lately brought out several microscopes of\r\nan improved form. His larger model, the “New International,” consists\r\nof a solid, well-built, firm tripod stand of the Ross-Jackson pattern,\r\nwhich appears to be quite in the ascendant among London opticians;\r\nrack and pinion coarse adjustment, and a superior micrometer fine\r\nadjustment; sub-stage with centring screws and rack and pinion\r\nfocussing adjustment; a new form of sliding pin-hole diaphragm and\r\niris diaphragm; B and C eye-pieces; 5/8 and 1/7 objectives; Abbe\r\ncondenser, N.A. 1·20; in every respect a perfect model, neatly packed\r\nin a mahogany case, for a very moderate sum. Mr. Pillischer’s No. 2\r\n(Fig. 93) “International” Microscope, being the _Army pattern_ as well\r\nas the _student’s_, is well adapted for clinical work. A firm tripod\r\nstand supports two dark bronze uprights, with rack and pinion coarse\r\nadjustment, _e_, and fine adjustment, _d_, the stage, _i_, is wide and\r\nsuitable for clinical work, and large enough for dissecting upon. The\r\nwhole instrument is well made; the coarse adjustment is so good that\r\nthe one-eighth inch can be focussed with ease, and without using the\r\nfine adjustment.\r\n\r\nFor a few shillings extra, a mechanical stage can be added, consisting\r\nof levers, having an action similar to the movements of a parallel\r\nruler, which is so easy of adjustment that it can be worked under\r\nthe eighth-inch objective with the hands--an advantage in a clinical\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Pillischer’s “International” Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe following reference letters serve to explain the general\r\nconstruction of the microscope (Fig. 93):--_a_, the eye-piece; _b_, the\r\ndraw-tube; _c_, the sliding-tube; _d_, micrometer or fine adjustment;\r\n_e e_, the coarse adjustment; _g_, the mirror arm and mirror; _h_,\r\nsub-stage carrying Abbe condenser; _i_, the stage with spring-clips;\r\n_j_, objectives screwed into place and double nose-piece.\r\n\r\nThe “Kosmos” is Pillischer’s cheaper model. The stand of this somewhat\r\nnovel and original microscope is framed entirely of brass and\r\ngun-metal. The fine adjustment is very sensitive and perfectly steady,\r\nadmitting of the highest immersion objectives being used. The optical\r\nparts are constructed upon principles consistent with the latest\r\nimprovements. It has a claw-foot stand with a semi-circular arm, which\r\ncarries the body, with sliding-tube coarse adjustment, and micrometer\r\nscrew fine adjustment, with a large square stage diaphragm and mirror.\r\nThe instrument is neatly packed in a mahogany box, together with the\r\nA or B eye-piece, 1-inch and 1/5-inch objectives of good defining and\r\npenetrating power, magnifying from 30 to 380 diameters, in mahogany\r\ncabinet, for the moderate sum of £5.\r\n\r\nPillischer’s Binocular Microscope (Fig. 94) is constructed on a plan\r\nsomewhat intermediate between that of Beck’s and Ross’s well-known\r\npatterns, and in point of finish is equal to any student’s microscope\r\nin use. The semi-circular form given to the arm carrying the body\r\nincreases the strength and solidity of the instrument, although it\r\nis doubtful whether it adds to its steadiness when placed in the\r\nhorizontal position. The straight body rests for a great part of its\r\nlength upon a parallel bar of solid brass ploughed into which is a\r\ngroove for the reception of the rack attached to the body, the groove\r\nbeing of such a form that the rack is held firmly while the pinion\r\nglides smoothly through it. A steady, uniform motion is thus obtained,\r\nwhich almost renders the fine adjustment unnecessary. The binocular\r\nbodies are inclined at a smaller angle to one another than in most\r\ninstruments; nevertheless, the range of motion given to the eye-pieces\r\nby the rack and pinion enables those whose eyes are widely separated\r\nto use the instrument with comfort. The prism is so well set that it\r\nilluminates both fields with equal intensity. The stage is provided\r\nwith rectangular traversing movements to the extent of an inch and a\r\nquarter in each direction. The milled heads which effect these are\r\nplaced on the same axis, instead of side by side, one of them--the\r\nvertical one--being repeated on the left of the stage, so that the\r\nmovements may be communicated either by the right hand alone or by both\r\nhands acting in concert. The stage-plate has the ordinary vertical and\r\nrotatory motions, but to a much greater extent than usual; and the\r\nplatform which carries the object is provided with a spring clip to\r\nsecure the object when the stage is placed in the vertical position.\r\nA new form of sub-stage with centring screws is made to carry the Abbe\r\nachromatic condenser, diaphragm, polarising and other apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Pillischer’s Binocular Microscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nContinental Microscopes.\r\n\r\n_Continental Microscopes._--The better known among continental\r\nopticians are Zeiss, Leitz, Seibert, Reichert and Hartnack. All seem\r\nto have vied with each other in the attainment of perfection in the\r\nmanufacture of the most useful forms of microscopes. The late Carl\r\nZeiss did more for the modern microscope than either of the opticians\r\nreferred to above. I therefore take a medium typical model of his from\r\na long series of highly-finished instruments for my illustration.\r\nZeiss’s successors have of late endeavoured to perfect the mechanical\r\ndetails of their instruments in three or four directions, i.e.,\r\nfundamental features of the stand, stage arrangements, means of\r\nfocussing, and illumination.\r\n\r\n_The Stand._--The general form of the stand still partakes too much of\r\nthe original sameness of type introduced by Oberhäuser, and modified\r\nand improved by Hartnack; the “Babuchin” stand being still in favour\r\nwith some few makers. The greater firmness and steadiness of Zeiss’s\r\nstand (Fig. 95) is secured by the horse-shoe form of foot, which,\r\nfor the most part, is massive and well adapted to carry the stout\r\nuprights, which support a well-balanced, substantial body-tube and a\r\ngraduated draw-tube, circular stage with a vulcanite disc, 4 inches in\r\ndiameter; a sub-stage with centring arrangement for Abbe’s illuminating\r\napparatus, and iris diaphragm and other diaphragms for use when the\r\ncondenser is thrown aside. The mirror is full-sized, plane and concave.\r\nThe coarse adjustment is regulated by a rack and pillion movement so\r\nperfect that objectives of medium power can be focussed by it alone.\r\nThe fine adjustment is made by micrometer screw, the force exercised by\r\nwhich is transferred to the movable body by a single contact between\r\ntwo hardened steel surfaces. This ensures extremely delicate and\r\nuniform motion of the body which carries the tube.\r\n\r\nThe divisions in the milled head of the screw furnish a means for the\r\nregistration of the vertical movements of the tube. In the latest\r\nstands, each division corresponds to an elevation or depression of\r\nthe tube in the direction of the optic axis of 0·01 mm. By this means\r\nmeasurements of thicknesses may be made with a considerable degree of\r\naccuracy, the upper and lower surfaces of the object being successively\r\nfocussed, and the amount read off on the milled-head, by the fixed\r\nindex. In doing this, care must be taken to make both adjustments by a\r\nrotation of the screw in the same direction. The thickness of an object\r\nin air is then equal to the difference between the two readings. By\r\nthis means the thickness of any other substance may be measured--that,\r\nfor instance, of the cover-glass of the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Zeiss’s Medium Stand Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe medium tube-length of the microscope is 160 mm. from the attachment\r\nof the objective to the eye-piece end. The draw-tube admits of the\r\nlength being increased or diminished, and this may be read off by means\r\nof the millimetre scale engraved on the tube. My description of this\r\nmodel also applies to the higher class microscopes, which will be found\r\nin every way well finished and adapted to biological and scientific\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--E. Leitz’s Medium-sized Microscope.]\r\n\r\n_E. Leitz’s of Wetzlar Microscopes._--This optician publishes a\r\nseries of twelve high-class forms of instruments. By preference, the\r\nhorse-shoe form of stand (Fig. 96) is adopted in the whole of this\r\nmaker’s models, the body being supported on a hinge joint and clamped\r\nover, and fitted with a circular revolving centred mechanical stage,\r\nattached to the ordinary stage by means of a set pin, which fixes the\r\nstage in position. By removing the screw, the stage can be detached;\r\nin this way, the stage serves for searching over large surfaces and\r\nregistering the results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Leitz’s Dissecting Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe coarse adjustment is made by rack and pinion, and the fine\r\nadjustment by micrometer screw, the head of which is provided with\r\na scale reading 1/100 mm. The draw-tube is also cut and ruled to\r\nmillimetre scale. The sub-stage has rack and pinion movement, and is\r\narranged for the Abbe condenser and iris diaphragm. This is attached\r\nto the upper stage by means of a set pin, which fixes and retains it\r\nin position after perfect centring. By removing the pin, the sub-stage\r\ncan be either detached or swung aside by pressing a button. In short,\r\nthis microscope is in all respects well furnished and fitted with\r\nthe requisite complex mechanism necessitated by modern high-class\r\ntechnicological work.\r\n\r\nLeitz’s students’ microscope, with sliding body, micrometer screw fine\r\nadjustment, concave mirror, two eye-pieces and two objectives, 3/4 inch\r\nand 1/8 inch, in mahogany case, costs £3 10_s._ Leitz’s dissecting\r\nmicroscope, with a heavy foot and rests, is fitted with two aplanatic\r\nlenses, magnifying × 10, × 20 diameters.\r\n\r\n_Reichert and Seibert_ adhere to the same model as that of Zeiss,\r\nand therefore require only a brief notice. Their microscopes are\r\ncharacterised by substantial workmanship, suitable construction, and\r\nexact centring. The coarse adjustment is obtained in the usual way by\r\nrack and pinion, the fine by micrometer screws, which work easily, and\r\nare protected against wear and tear by having their working surfaces\r\nhardened. The stands of the better class instruments have micrometer\r\nscrews graduated, and draw-tubes cut to millimetre scale. Their\r\nmechanical stages and sub-stages and accessories are in every way well\r\nfinished; stage forceps, tests, and an assortment of cover glasses\r\nand slides being added. Their first-class microscopes are sent out in\r\nmahogany boxes.\r\n\r\nOn going through the continental makers’ catalogues, it will be noticed\r\nthat their well-equipped microscopes are rather more costly than that\r\nof their English _confreres_. It is understood Messrs. Baker and Watson\r\nare the constituted agents for these opticians.\r\n\r\n_Nachet’s Microscope_, a new form of which was first seen at the\r\nAntwerp Exhibition 1892, is very solidly built, and has all the\r\nqualities necessary for histological work. The stage rotates about the\r\noptic axis, and carries a movable slide holder. The coarse adjustment\r\nis by rack and pinion movement, the fine by the new system of\r\nmicrometer screw (described in the journal of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety of 1886), with divided head indicating the 1/400 part of a mm.\r\nThe plane and convex mirror is mounted on a jointed arm. The draw-tube\r\nis divided into millimetres. The illuminating system, consisting of a\r\nwide-angled Abbe condenser (N.A. 1·40) with iris diaphragm, is raised\r\nor lowered by rack and pinion screws. The iris diaphragm, being mounted\r\non a wheel, is worked by a tangent screw, which by a very slight\r\nmovement causes the aperture of the diaphragm to pass from the centre\r\nto the periphery of the condenser. Altogether the arrangement of the\r\nsub-stage is novel, and the instrument is extremely well arranged and\r\nadapted to modern requirements.\r\n\r\nNachet and Hartnack, of Paris, hold an almost equal rank as makers of\r\nfirst-class microscopes, and in point of excellence of workmanship\r\nfairy rival those of our English makers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Nachet’s Class Demonstrating Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThere are very many other London and Continental makers of microscopes\r\nbesides those especially mentioned, who have well-sustained reputations\r\nas opticians, and who, from want of space, I have been obliged to pass\r\nover. Messrs. Newton’s Students’ Microscope must be mentioned with\r\nrespect. It is a good and useful instrument, has a firm stand with a\r\nreversible (rotatory) body movement, which seems to ensure steadiness\r\nwhen brought into the horizontal position for micro-photographic\r\npurposes. There are other opticians whose microscopes have stood the\r\ntest of time--Messrs. Collins, Crouch, &c. It may, however, be taken as\r\na well-established fact that those opticians known to manufacture the\r\nmore highly-finished models also produce the more serviceable forms of\r\nstudents’ class-room, and other microscopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bacteriological Microscope.\r\n\r\nThe microscope required for bacteriological studies should be perfect\r\nin all its parts. With regard to the choice of an instrument, it is\r\nvery much a matter of price, since the most perfect is usually the\r\nmost costly; I shall therefore proceed to give a typical example of\r\nthe instrument in use in a bacteriological laboratory. The microscope\r\nshould possess the following qualifications, all of which are\r\nabsolutely necessary for the study of such minute objects as bacteria\r\nand other micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n“The typical bacteriological microscope should be well equipped with\r\nobjectives of sufficiently high magnifying power, and with a special\r\nform of illuminating apparatus; while the mechanical arrangements for\r\nfocussing should act with the greatest smoothness and precision; the\r\nstage, also, should be wide enough to admit of the examination of plate\r\ncultivations.”\r\n\r\nWe will consider these several points and recommendations _seriatim_,\r\ncommencing with the stand.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Watson & Sons’ Van Heurck model stand so well answers the\r\nseveral conditions laid down by an experienced teacher of bacteriology,\r\nthat I have no hesitation in presenting it to my readers as a typical\r\ninstrument, one in every way worthy of the high praise it has already\r\nreceived from those who have worked with it, and whose judgment may\r\nbe relied upon in every way. The microscope is fully described among\r\nMessrs. Watson’s instruments, page 108.\r\n\r\n_The Stand._--A good firm stand is undoubtedly of the first importance\r\nfor all high-class work. The steadiness of the instrument and its\r\nentire freedom from vibration depends largely upon the form of the\r\nstand. I am glad to find Dr. Crookshank in accord with me as to the\r\nRoss-Jackson model, one which, in my opinion, has not been entirely\r\nsuperseded by models of a more recent date. Indeed, the latest\r\nimprovement effected in the Ross-Jackson form, in which attention has\r\nbeen given to the spreading-out of the feet, has converted it into as\r\nsolid and firm a stand as Powell’s; it is equally free from vibration\r\nwhen placed in the horizontal position.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, four different forms of stands--the tripod; the\r\nplate with double columns; the single column ending in a plate or a\r\nbent claw; and the horse shoe. The tripod stand, with cork feet, is\r\nby far the steadiest form of model. The single upright pillar support\r\nshould unquestionably be condemned, as it admits of considerable\r\nvibration, and is most inconvenient for laboratory work. The heavy\r\nhorse-shoe form is compact and firm, and the weight of it can hardly be\r\nconsidered an objection.\r\n\r\n_The Tubular Body_ is from eight to ten inches in length, to which is\r\nadded a draw-tube with an engraved millimetre scale. By extending the\r\ndraw-tube greater magnification is obtained, but since this is at the\r\ncost of definition it should hardly ever be employed in the examination\r\nof bacteria. _A Triple Nose-piece_ is doubtless a convenience, saving\r\ntime which is otherwise spent in replacing objectives of different\r\nmagnifying powers; there is also less risk of injuring them. _Focus_\r\nshould be obtained by means of a rack and pinion coarse adjustment,\r\ntogether with the most approved kind of fine adjustment. The sliding\r\ntube cannot be recommended, as the motion may be stiff, encouraging the\r\nuse of force, which in turn may result in the objective being brought\r\nviolently into contact with the specimen, thus doing injury to the lens\r\nor damage to the preparation; or it may get too loose and readily slip\r\nout of focus.\r\n\r\n_The Stage_ should be flat and rigid, either rectangular or circular,\r\nso long as it is sufficiently large to accommodate plate cultivation. A\r\nremovable mechanical stage is of great advantage for working with high\r\npowers, as a motile bacterium can be constantly kept in view, while one\r\nhand is engaged in working the fine adjustment; it may also be employed\r\nas a finder, if engraved with a longitudinal and vertical scale, and\r\nprovided with a stop. The mechanical stage must be removable, so that\r\nthe stage proper may be free from any attachments when required for the\r\nexamination of cultures.\r\n\r\n_Diaphragms._--The plan of using a series of separate discs of\r\ndifferent sizes should be avoided, as they are easily lost, and\r\nbacteriological investigations may have to be made under conditions in\r\nwhich it is difficult to replace them. A better plan is a revolving\r\nplate with apertures of different sizes, but the most convenient form\r\nis the _iris diaphragm_.\r\n\r\n_The Sub-stage Condenser_ is as necessary in biological work as in\r\nthe objective--in fact, the condenser and the objective should be\r\nconsidered as forming one piece of optical apparatus; the microscope\r\nmust be regarded as incomplete without it.\r\n\r\nIt is by the _sub-stage condenser_ that the rays of light are\r\nconcentrated at one point, or on one particular bacterium; for the best\r\ndefinition it is essential that there should be mechanical arrangements\r\nfor accurately centring and focussing the condenser. All this will be\r\nexplained and enlarged upon under “Practical Optics.”\r\n\r\nIn the historical review presented to my readers on the evolution of\r\nthe modern microscope, I have for the most part relied upon my long\r\nand close association, extending over a period of upwards of half a\r\ncentury, with microscopy. I need hardly say I could have very much\r\nextended my remarks with pleasure and profit had space permitted, and\r\nthereby much increased the number of names of manufacturers, who have\r\nwell-established reputations for the quality of their work, and whose\r\ninstruments, more or less complete in design, realise the wants of\r\nstudents and of that large class of present-day workers engaged in\r\nmicroscopical pursuits to whom economy of outlay is almost a first\r\nconsideration. No valid reason, however, can be assigned for splitting\r\nup, as some writers do, the several forms of microscopes into some six\r\ndifferent classes, which implies inferiority in mechanical details or\r\nfinish, whereas the difference wholly consists in luxurious appliances\r\nto save time, and in accessories for special work or original research.\r\nBefore bringing these remarks to a close, it is my wish to direct the\r\nstudent’s attention to one or two points of importance in connection\r\nwith the use of the instrument, viz.: variations in body-lengths of\r\nmicroscopes, especially between those of English and of Continental\r\nmanufacture. The _optical-standard_ measurement adopted in this country\r\nfor the body-tube-length is 10 inches; and for its _mechanical_, 8-3/4\r\ninches. That of Continental opticians is, optical-tube-length 7·08\r\ninches, or 180 mm.; the mechanical, 6·3 inches = to 168 mm.\r\n\r\nProfessor Abbe constructed an apochromatic immersion objective\r\nespecially for the English optical tube-length of 10·6 inches (= to\r\n270 m.m.), and mechanical tube-length somewhat less in measurement.\r\nThis may be taken to mean a slight increase in the standard value of\r\nthe tube, and therefore the addition of the rack-and-pinion to the\r\ndraw-tube, now generally made a part of the microscope, is certainly\r\nof some practical value. This difference, however, when working with\r\nthe English body-tube of 10 inches, may be discarded; it is, in\r\nfact, only where the shorter Continental body is in use, that so\r\nsmall a difference of tube-length exercises a disturbing effect over\r\nadjustment. Moreover, an object placed on the stage of the shorter\r\nbody microscope will not be seen with the same distinctness by the\r\ndraughtsman should he wish to make use of the _camera lucida_.\r\n\r\nThe _optical_ tube-length of the body is measured from the back lens of\r\nthe objective to the front lens or principal focus of the eye-piece;\r\nthe _mechanical_ tube-length from the end of nose-piece of objective to\r\nthe top lens of the eye-piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hartnach Students’ Model Microscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nApplied Optics:--Eye-pieces; Achromatic Objectives; Condensers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary to say that the eye-piece forms a most\r\nimportant part of applied optics in the microscope. It is an optical\r\ncombination designed to bring the pencil of rays from the objective to\r\nassist in the formation of a real or virtual image before it arrives\r\nat the eye of the observer. Greater attention has been given of late\r\nyears to the improvement of the eye-piece, since flatness of field\r\nmuch depends upon it. Opticians have therefore sought to make it both\r\nachromatic and compensatory.\r\n\r\nThere are several forms of eye-pieces in use, some of which partake of\r\na special character, and these will receive attention in their proper\r\nplaces. It is, however, customary among English opticians to denote\r\nthe value of their several eye-pieces by Roman capitals, A, B, C, D,\r\nand E. Continental opticians, on the other hand, have a preference\r\nfor numerals, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, or more, and by which they are\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nThe eye-piece in more general use is that known as the _Huyghenian_\r\n(Fig. 99); this came into use upwards of two centuries ago. It was\r\nconstructed by Christian Huyghens, a Dutch philosopher and eminent man\r\nof science, secretary to William III.\r\n\r\nIt was made for the eye-piece of a telescope he constructed with his\r\nown hands, and it has been in constant use as the eye-piece of the\r\nmicroscope for nearly two centuries. It consists of two plano-convex\r\nlenses, with their plane surfaces turned towards the eye, and divided\r\nat a distance equal to half the sum of their focal lengths--in other\r\nwords, at half the sum of the focal length of the eye-glass and of the\r\ndistance from the field-glass at which an image from the object glass\r\nwould be formed, a stop, or diaphragm, being placed between the two\r\nlenses for the reason about to be explained. Huyghens himself appears\r\nto have been quite unaware of the value of an eye-piece so cleverly\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 99.--Huyghenian Eye-piece A, the dotted lines show position of\r\nlenses.]\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Boscovich to point out that, by this important\r\narrangement, he had corrected a portion of the chromatic aberration\r\nincidental to the earlier form of eye-pieces. Let Fig. 100 represent\r\nthe Huyghenian eye-piece of a microscope, _f f_ being the field-glass,\r\nand _e e_ the eye-glass, and _l m n_ the two extreme rays of each of\r\nthe three pencils emanating from the centre and ends of the object,\r\nof which, but for the field-glass, a series of coloured images would\r\nbe formed from _r r_ to _b b_; those near _r r_ being red, those\r\nnear _b b_ blue, and the intermediate ones green, yellow, and so on,\r\ncorresponding with the colours of the prismatic Spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe effect described, that of projecting the blue image beyond the red,\r\nover-correcting the object-glass as to colour, is purposely produced;\r\nit is also seen that the images _b b_ and _r r_ are curved in the wrong\r\ndirection to be seen distinctly by the convex eye-lens; this then is a\r\nfurther defect of the compound microscope made up of two lenses. But\r\nthe field-glass, at the same time that it bends the rays and converges\r\nthem to foci at _b′ b′_ and _r′ r′_, also reverses the curvature of the\r\nimages as here shown, giving them the form best adapted for distinct\r\nvision by the eye-glass _e e_. The field-glass has at the same time\r\nbrought the blue and red images closer together, so that they produce\r\nan almost colourless image to the eye. The chromatic aberration of\r\nlenses has been clearly explained in a previous chapter. But let it\r\nbe supposed that the object-glass had not been over-corrected, that\r\nit had been perfectly achromatic; the rays would then have appeared\r\ncoloured as soon as they had passed the field-glass; the blue rays\r\nof the central pencil, for example, would converge at _b′′_, and the\r\nred rays at _r′′_, which is just the reverse of what is required of\r\nthe eye-lens; for as its blue focus is also shorter than its red, it\r\nwould require that the blue image should be at _r′′_, and the red at\r\n_b′′_. This effect is due to over-correction of the object-glass,\r\nwhich removes the blue foci _b b_ as much beyond the red foci _r\r\nr_ as the sum of the distances between the red and the blue foci of\r\nthe field-lens and eye-lens; so that the separation _b r_ is exactly\r\ntaken up in passing through those two lenses, and the several colours\r\ncoincide, so far as focal distance is concerned, as the rays pass the\r\neye-lens. So that while they coincide as to distance, they differ in\r\nanother respect--the blue image is rendered smaller than the red by\r\nthe greater refractive power of the field-glass upon the former. In\r\ntracing the pencil _l_, for instance, it will be noticed that, after\r\npassing the field-glass, two sets of lines are drawn, one whole and\r\none dotted, the former representing the red, and the latter the blue\r\nrays. This accidental effect in the Huyghenian eye-piece was pointed\r\nout by Boscovich. The separation into colours of the field-glass is\r\nlike the over-correction of the object-glass--and opens the way to\r\nits complete correction. If the differently-coloured rays were kept\r\ntogether till they reached the eye-glass, they would still be coloured,\r\nand present coloured images to the eye. The separating effected by the\r\nfield-glass causes the blue rays to fall so much nearer the centre of\r\nthe eye-glass, where, owing to its spherical figure, the refractive\r\npower is less than at the margin, so that spherical error of the\r\neye-lens may be said to constitute a nearly equal balance to the\r\nchromatic dispersion of the field-lens, and the blue and red rays _l′_\r\nand _l′′_ emerge nearly parallel, presenting a fairly good definition\r\nof a single point to the eye. The same may be said of the intermediate\r\ncolours of the other pencils. The eye-glass thus constructed not only\r\nbrings together the images _b′ b′_, _r′ r′_, but it likewise has the\r\nmost important effect of rendering them flatter, and assisting in the\r\ncorrection of chromatic and spherical aberration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Huyghenian Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Ramsden’s Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\nThe later form of the Huyghenian eye-piece is that of the late Sir\r\nGeorge Airy, the field-glass of which is a meniscus with the convex\r\nside turned towards the objective, and the eye-lens a crossed convex\r\nwith its flatter side towards the eye. Another negative eye-piece is\r\nthat known as the _Kellner_, or orthoscopic eye-piece. It consists\r\nof a bi-convex field-glass and an achromatic doublet eye-lens. This\r\nmagnifies ten times, but it in no way compares with the Huyghenian in\r\nvalue. Neither does it afford the same flatness of field.\r\n\r\nThe _Ramsden_, or positive eye-piece, is chiefly employed as a\r\nmicrometer eye-piece for the measurement of the values of magnified\r\nimages. The construction of this eye-piece is shown in Fig. 101, a\r\ndivided scale being cut on a strip of glass in 1/100ths of an inch,\r\nevery fifth of which is cut longer than the rest to facilitate the\r\nreading of the markings, and at the same time that of the image of the\r\nobject, both being distinctly seen together, as in the accompanying\r\nreduced micro-photograph of blood corpuscles, Fig. 102.\r\n\r\nThe value of such measurements in reference to the real object, when\r\nonce obtained; is constant for the same objective. It becomes apparent,\r\nthen, that the value of the divisions seen in the eye-piece micrometer\r\nmust be found with all the objectives used, and carefully tabulated.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Lister who first proposed to place on the stage of the\r\nmicroscope a divided scale of a certain value. Viewing the scale as a\r\nmicroscopic object, he observed how many of the divisions on the scale\r\nattached to the eye-piece corresponded with one or more of a magnified\r\nimage. If, for instance, ten of those in the eye-piece correspond with\r\none of those in the image, and if the divisions are known to be equal,\r\nthen the image is ten times larger than the object, and the dimensions\r\nof the object ten times less than that indicated by the micrometer.\r\nIf the divisions on the micrometer and on the magnified scale are not\r\nequal, it becomes a mere rule-of-three sum; but in general this trouble\r\nis taken by the maker of the instrument, who furnishes a table showing\r\nthe value of each division of the micrometer for every object-glass\r\nwith which it will be employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Blood Corpuscles and Micrometer, magnified\r\n1·3500.]\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson’s simple and cheap micrometer is represented in Fig. 103.\r\nIt consists of a slip of glass placed in the focus of the eye-glass,\r\nwith the divisions sufficiently fine to have the value of the\r\nten-thousandth part of an inch with the quarter-inch object-glass, and\r\nthe twenty-thousandth with the eighth; at the same time the half, or\r\neven the quarter of a division may be estimated, thus affording the\r\nmeans of attaining considerable accuracy, and may be used to supersede\r\nthe more complicated and expensive screw-micrometer, being handier to\r\nuse, and not liable to derangement in inexperienced hands.\r\n\r\nThe positive eye-piece affords the best view of the micrometer, the\r\nnegative of the object. The former is quite free from distortion, even\r\nto the edges of the field; but the object is slightly coloured. The\r\nlatter is free from colour, and is slightly distorted at the edges. In\r\nthe centre of the field, however, to the extent of half its diameter,\r\nthere is no perceptible distortion, and the clearness of the definition\r\ngives a precision to the measurement which is very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--Jackson’s Eye-piece Micrometer.]\r\n\r\nShort bold lines are ruled on a piece of glass, _a_, Fig. 103, to\r\nfacilitate counting, the fifth is drawn longer, and the tenth still\r\nlonger, as in the common rule. Very fine levigated plumbago is rubbed\r\ninto the lines to render them visible; they are then covered with a\r\npiece of thin glass, cemented by Canada balsam, to prevent the plumbago\r\nfrom being wiped out. The slip of glass thus prepared is secured in a\r\nthin brass frame, so that it may slide freely into its place.\r\n\r\nSlips are cut in the negative eye-piece on each side, so that the brass\r\nframe may be pressed across the field in the focus of the eye-glass,\r\nas at _m_; the cell of which should have a longer screw than usual, to\r\nadmit of adjustment for different eyes. The brass frame is retained\r\nin its place by a spring within the tube of the eye-piece; and in\r\nusing it the object is brought to the centre of the field by the stage\r\nmovements; the coincidence between one side of it and one of the long\r\nlines is made with great accuracy by means of the small screw acting\r\nupon the slip of glass. The divisions are then read off as easily as\r\nthe inches and tenths on a common rule. The operation, indeed, is\r\nnothing more than the laying of a rule across the body to be measured;\r\nand it matters not whether the object be transparent or opaque, mounted\r\nor unmounted, if its edges can be distinctly seen, its diameter can be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nPreviously, however, to using the micrometer, the value of its\r\ndivisions should be ascertained with each object-glass; the method of\r\ndoing this is as follows:--\r\n\r\nPlace a slip of ruled glass on the stage; and having turned the\r\neye-piece so that the lines on the two glasses are parallel, read off\r\nthe number of divisions in the eye-piece which cover one on the stage.\r\nRepeat this process with different portions of the stage-micrometer,\r\nand if there be a difference, take the mean. Suppose the hundredth of\r\nan inch on the stage requires eighteen divisions in the eye-piece to\r\ncover it; it is plain that an inch would require eighteen hundred,\r\nand an object which occupied nine of these divisions would measure\r\nthe two-hundredth of an inch. Take the instance supposed, and let\r\nthe microscope be furnished with a draw-tube, marked on the side\r\nwith inches and tenths. By drawing this out a short distance, the\r\nimage of the stage micrometer will be expanded until one division is\r\ncovered by twenty in the eye-piece. These will then have the value\r\nof two-thousandths of an inch, and the object which before measured\r\nnine will then measure ten; which, divided by 2,000, gives the decimal\r\nfraction ·005.\r\n\r\nEnter in a table the length to which the tube is drawn out, and the\r\nnumber of divisions on the eye-piece micrometer equivalent to an\r\ninch on the stage; and any measurements afterwards taken with the\r\nsame micrometer and object-glass may, by a short process of mental\r\narithmetic, be reduced to the decimal parts of an inch, if not actually\r\nobserved in them.\r\n\r\nIn ascertaining the value of the micrometer with a deep objective, if\r\nthe hundredth of an inch on the stage occupies too much of the field,\r\nthen the two-hundredth or five-hundredth should be used and the number\r\nof the divisions corresponding to that quantity be multiplied by two\r\nhundred or five hundred, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe micrometer should not be fitted into too deep an eye-piece, as it\r\nis essential to preserve good definition. A middle-power Kellner or\r\nHuyghenian is frequently employed; at all events, use the eye-piece of\r\nlower power rather than impair the image.\r\n\r\nThe eye-lens above the micrometer should not be of shorter focus than\r\nthree-quarters of an inch, even with high-power objectives.\r\n\r\n_The Ramsden Eye-piece._--The cobweb micrometer is the most efficient\r\npiece of apparatus yet brought into use for measuring the magnified\r\nimage. It is made by stretching across the field of the eye-piece two\r\nextremely fine parallel wires or cobwebs, one or both of which can be\r\nseparated by the action of a micrometer screw, the trap head of which\r\nis divided into a hundred or more equal parts, which successively pass\r\nby an index as the milled head is turned, shown in Fig. 104. A portion\r\nof the field of view is cut off at right angles to the filaments by a\r\nscale formed of a thin plate of brass having notches at its edges, the\r\ndistances between which correspond to the threads of the screw, every\r\nfifth notch (as in the previous case) being made deeper than the rest,\r\nto make the work of enumeration easier. The number of entire divisions\r\non the scale shows then how many complete turns of the screw have been\r\nmade in the separation of the wires, while the number of index points\r\non the milled head shows the value to the fraction of a turn, that\r\nmay have been made in addition. A screw with one hundred threads to\r\nthe inch is that usually employed; this gives to each division in the\r\nscale in the eye-piece the value of 1/100th of an inch. The edge of the\r\nmilled head is also divided into the same number of parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--Ramsden Screw Micrometer Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\nIn Watson’s Ramsden screw micrometer, Fig. 104, the micrometer scale\r\n(seen detached) is ruled on a circular piece of glass, and this, by\r\nunscrewing the top, is dropped into its place, and one of the wires,\r\nboth being fixed, is set a little to the side of the field, the teeth\r\nof the screw being cut to 1/100ths, and the drum giving the fractional\r\nspace between the teeth to 1/100ths, so that the 1/10000th of an inch\r\ncan be read off. This micrometer eye-piece is constructed entirely of\r\naluminium, a decided advantage, being so much lighter than brass to\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nIn the screw micrometer of other makers, other modifications are found.\r\nAn iris diaphragm being placed below the web to suit the power of\r\nthe eye-piece employed, a guiding line at right angles to the web is\r\nsometimes added. Care should be taken to see that when the movable web\r\ncoincides exactly with the fixed web, the indicator on the graduated\r\nhead stands at zero.\r\n\r\n_The Compensating Eye-piece._--The very important improvements effected\r\nin the construction of the objective naturally led up to an equally\r\nuseful change for the better in the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nAll objectives of wide aperture, from the curvature of their\r\nhemispherical front lenses, show a certain amount of colour defect in\r\nthe extra-axial portion of the field, even if perfectly achromatic in\r\nthe centre. Whether an image be directly projected by the objective, or\r\nwhether it be examined with an aplanatic eye-piece, colour fringes may\r\nbe detected, possibly in an increasing degree towards the periphery.\r\nThis residual chromatic aberration has at length been very nearly\r\neliminated by the aid of the compensating eye-piece.\r\n\r\nThe construction of compensating eye-pieces is somewhat remarkable,\r\nsince they have an equivalent error in an opposite direction--that is,\r\nthe image formed by the red rays is greater than that corresponding\r\nto the blue rays; consequently, eye-pieces so constructed serve to\r\ncompensate for the unequal magnification produced by different coloured\r\nrays, and images appear free from colour up to the margin of the field.\r\n\r\nZeiss’s compensating eye-pieces are so arranged that the lower focal\r\npoints of each series lie in the same plane when inserted in the\r\nbody-tube of the microscope; no alteration of focus is therefore\r\nrequired on changing one eye-piece for another. This of itself is\r\nnot only an advantage but also a saving of time, while the distance\r\nbetween the upper focal point of the objective and the lower one of the\r\neye-piece, which is the determining element of magnification, remains\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 105.--A sectional view of Zeiss’s Compensating series of\r\nEye-pieces, 1/2 the full size.\r\n\r\nA.--Plane of the upper edge of the tube.\r\n\r\nB.--Lower focal plane of eye-pieces, with their lenses _in situ_.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary working eye-pieces, Huyghenian and others, commencing\r\nwith a magnification of four diameters, are so constructed that they\r\ncan be conveniently used, as we are accustomed to use them in England,\r\nwith high powers, Zeiss’s Nos. 12 and 18 compensating eye-pieces\r\nbeing adapted for use with his lower power apochromatic lenses of 16\r\nand 8 mm. The numbering of the eye-pieces is carried out on the plan\r\noriginally proposed by Professor Abbe--that is, the number denotes\r\nhow many times an eye-piece, when employed with a given tube-length,\r\nincreases the initial magnifying power of the objective, and at the\r\nsame time furnishes figures for their rational enumeration. It is on\r\nthis basis that the German compensating eye-pieces have been arranged\r\nin series, and in agreement with their magnifying power and distinctive\r\nnumberings of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18. Of these several eye-pieces, 12 is\r\nfound to be the most useful. The magnification obtained by combining\r\na compensating eye-piece with any apochromatic objective is found by\r\nmultiplying its number by the initial magnification of the objective,\r\nas given in the following proof:--An objective of 3·0 mm. focus, for\r\nexample, gives in itself a magnification of 83·3 (calculated, for the\r\nconventional distance of vision, 250 mm.); eye-piece 12 therefore gives\r\nwith this objective a magnification of 12 × 83·3 = 1000 diameters.\r\nThe classification, however, of these eye-pieces, as furnished by\r\nAbbe, is dependent upon increase in the total magnifying power of the\r\nmicroscope obtained by means of the eye-piece as compared with that\r\ngiven by the objective alone. The numbering, then, denotes how many\r\ntimes an eye-piece increases the magnifying power of the objective\r\nwhen used with a given body-tube; the proper measure of the eye-piece\r\nmagnification; and, at the same time, the figures for rational\r\nenumeration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--B and C Achromatic Eye-pieces.]\r\n\r\nCompensating eye-pieces have been introduced for the correction of\r\ncertain errors in high-power objectives--those made with hemispherical\r\nfronts. All such lenses, whether apochromatic or not, are greatly\r\nimproved by the compensating eye-piece, but the dry objective and the\r\nlower powers are certainly deteriorated. The lower power compensating\r\neye-pieces are Huyghenian, the higher are combinations, with no\r\nfield-lens, and therefore in working act as a single or positive\r\neye-piece. This is of importance to those who work with low powers--the\r\nolder forms of objectives.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Watson and Swift have adopted a new formula for their series\r\nof _achromatic eye-pieces_, whereby their magnification and flatness\r\nof field are improved. These also bear a constant ratio to the initial\r\npower of their objectives.\r\n\r\nThe compensating eye-pieces of these makers are constructed on the same\r\nprinciple as those of Zeiss’s for the correction of errors of colour in\r\nthe marginal portion of the field, and consequently are in every way\r\nas effective as those of Continental manufacture. Figs. 106, 107, and\r\n108 show in dotted outline the form and position of the several lenses\r\ncombined in these eye-pieces.\r\n\r\n_Projection Eye-pieces_ are chiefly used in micro-photography, and for\r\nscreen demonstrations. The cap of this eye-piece is provided with a\r\nspiral adjustment for focussing, the diaphragm being placed in front\r\nof the eye-lens, an essential arrangement for obtaining an accurate\r\nfocus. The ring seen below the cap, Fig. 108, is graduated so that the\r\nrotation for distance of screen may be carefully recorded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--The Compensating Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Projection Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\nSchmidt’s goniometer positive eye-piece, for measuring the angles of\r\ncrystals, is so arranged as to be easily rotated within a large and\r\naccurately graduated circle. In the focus of the eye-piece a single\r\ncobweb is drawn across, and to the upper part is attached a vernier.\r\nThe crystals being placed in the field of the microscope, care being\r\ntaken that they lie _perfectly flat_, the vernier is brought to zero,\r\nand then the whole apparatus turned until the line is parallel with\r\none face of the crystal; the frame-work bearing the cobweb, with the\r\nvernier, is now rotated until the cobweb becomes parallel with the next\r\nface of the crystal, and the number of degrees which it has traversed\r\nmay then be accurately read off.\r\n\r\n_Goniometer._--If a higher degree of precision is required, then, the\r\ndouble-refracting goniometer invented by the late Dr. Leeson must be\r\nsubstituted. With this goniometer (Fig. 109) the angles of crystals,\r\nwhether microscopic or otherwise, can be measured. It has removed\r\nthe earlier difficulties incident to similar instruments formerly in\r\nuse. Among other advantages, it is capable of measuring opaque and\r\neven imperfect crystals, beside microscopic crystals and those in the\r\ninterior of other transparent media. It is equally applicable to the\r\nlargest crystals, and will measure angles without removing the crystal\r\nfrom a specimen, provided only the whole is placed on a suitable\r\nadjusting stage. The value of the goniometer depends on the application\r\nof a doubly refracting prism, either of Iceland spar or of quartz, cut\r\nof such a thickness as will partially separate the two images of the\r\nangle it is proposed to measure.\r\n\r\nDr. Leeson strongly insisted on the importance of the microscope in\r\nthe examination of the planes of crystals subjected to measurement,\r\nas obliquity in many cases arises from not only conchoidal fractures,\r\nbut also from imperfect laminæ elevating one portion of a plane, and\r\nyet allowing a very tolerable reflection when measured by the double\r\nrefracting goniometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--Leeson’s Goniometer.]\r\n\r\nMicroscopes for crystallographic and petrological research are now\r\nspecially constructed for measuring the angles of crystals.\r\n\r\nErector eye-pieces and erecting prisms are employed for the purpose\r\nof causing the image presented to the eye to correspond with that\r\nof the object. They are also helpful in making minute dissections\r\nof structure; the loss of light, however, by sending it through two\r\nadditional surfaces is a drawback, and impairs the sharpness of the\r\nimage. Nachet designed an extremely ingenious arrangement whereby the\r\ninverted image became erect; he adapted a simple rectangular prism to\r\nthe eye-piece. The obliquity which a prism gives to the visual rays\r\nwhen the microscope is used in the erect position, as for dissecting,\r\nis an advantage, as it brings the image to the eye at an angle very\r\nnearly corresponding to that of the inclined position in which the\r\nmicroscope is ordinarily used.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Achromatic Objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--Pan-aplanatic Achromatic Objectives.]\r\n\r\n_The Achromatic Objective_, of all the optical and mechanical adjuncts\r\nto the microscope, is in every way the most necessary, as well as the\r\nmost important. The ideal of perfection aimed at by the optician is\r\na combination of lenses that shall produce a perfect image--that is,\r\none absolutely perfect in definition and almost free from colour. The\r\nmethod resorted to for the elimination of spherical and chromatic\r\naberration in the lens has been fully explained in a former chapter. It\r\nwill now be my endeavour to show the progressive stages of achromatism\r\nand evolution of the microscope throughout the present century.\r\n\r\nIt is almost as difficult to assign the date of the earliest\r\napplication of achromatism to the microscope as to that of the\r\ninception and many modifications of the instrument in past ages;\r\nindeed, the question of priority in every step taken in its improvement\r\nhas been the subject of controversy.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier workers in the first decade of this century will be\r\nfound the name of Bernardo Marzoni, who was curator of the Physical\r\nLaboratory of the Lyceum of Brescia. He, an amateur optician, it\r\nhas come to light, in 1808 constructed an achromatic objective, and\r\nexhibited it at Milan in 1811, when he obtained the award of a silver\r\nmedal for its merits, under the authority of the “Institute Reale\r\ndelli Scienzo.” Through the good offices of the late Mr. John Mayall\r\none of Marzoni’s objectives, which had been carefully preserved, was\r\npresented to the Royal Microscopical Society of London in 1890.[20]\r\nThis objective is a cemented combination, with the plane side of the\r\nflint-lens presented to the object. This was an improvement of a\r\npractical kind, and of which Chevalier subsequently availed himself.\r\nIn 1823 Selligue, a French optician, is credited with having first\r\nsuggested the plan of combining two, three, or four plano-convex\r\nachromatic doublets of similar foci, one above the other, to increase\r\nthe power and the aperture of the microscope. Fresnel, who reported\r\nupon this invention, preferred on the whole Adam’s arrangement, because\r\nit gave a larger field. Selligue subsequently improved his objective by\r\nplacing a small diaphragm between the mirror and the object.\r\n\r\nIn this country, Tully was induced by Dr. Goring to work at the\r\nachromatic objective, and his first efforts were attended with a\r\nsuccess quite equal to that of Chevalier’s. Lister on examining these\r\nlenses said:--“The French optician knows nothing of the value of\r\naperture, but he has shown us that fine performance is not confined to\r\ntriple objectives.” Amici, the amateur optician of Modena, visited this\r\ncountry in 1827 and brought his achromatic microscope and objectives,\r\nwhich were seen to give increase of aperture by combining doublets with\r\ntriplets. The most lasting improvement in the achromatic objective was\r\nthat of Joseph Jackson Lister, F.R.S., the father of Lord Lister, and\r\none of the founders of the Royal Microscopical Society of London.\r\n\r\nLister’s discoveries at this period (1829) in the history of the\r\noptics of the microscope were of greater importance than they have\r\nbeen represented to be. That he was an enthusiast is manifest, for,\r\nbeing unable to find an optician to carry out his formula for grinding\r\nlenses, he at once set to work to grind his own, and in a short time\r\nwas able to make a lens which was said to be the best of the day.\r\n\r\nLister, in a paper contributed to the proceedings of the Royal Society\r\nthe same year, pointed out how the aberrations of one doublet could be\r\nneutralised by a second. He further demonstrated that the flint lens\r\nshould be a plano-concave joined by a permanent cement to the convex\r\ncrown-glass. The first condition, he states, “obviates the risk of\r\nerror in centring the two curves, and the second diminishes by one half\r\nthe loss of light from reflection, which is very great at the numerous\r\nsurfaces of every combination.” These two conditions then--that the\r\nflint lens shall be plano-concave, and that it shall be joined by some\r\ncement (Canada balsam) to the convex--may be taken as the basis for\r\nthe microscopic objective, provided they can be reconciled with the\r\ncorrection of spherical and chromatic aberration of a large pencil.\r\n\r\nAndrew Ross was not slow to perceive the value of Lister’s suggestions\r\nand in 1831 he had constructed an object-glass on the lines laid\r\ndown by Lister, Fig. 112; _a a′_ representing the anterior pair, _m_\r\nthe middle, and _p_ the posterior, the three sets combined forming\r\nthe achromatic objective, consisting of three pairs of lenses, a\r\ndouble-convex crown-glass, and a plano-concave of flint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Lister’s double-convex crown and\r\nplano-concave flint cemented combination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Andrew Ross’s 1/4-inch Objective.]\r\n\r\nLister proposed other combinations, and himself made an object-glass\r\nconsisting of a meniscus pair with a triple middle, and a back\r\nplano-convex doublet. This had a working distance of ·11 and proved to\r\nbe so great a success that other opticians--Hugh Powell, 1834; James\r\nSmith, 1839--made objectives after the same formula.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Lister’s data proved of value in another direction:\r\nit stimulated opticians to apply themselves to the further improvement\r\nof the achromatic objective. Andrew Ross was one of the more earnest\r\nworkers in giving effect to Lister’s principles and a short time\r\nafterwards found that a triple combination, with the lenses separated\r\nby short intervals, gave better results. In the accompanying diagram\r\nthe changes made in the combination of the objective from 1831, and\r\nextending over a period of about twenty years from this date, are\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nEach objective, from the 1/2-inch to the 1/12-inch, is seen to be built\r\nup of at least six or eight different fronts, the back combinations\r\nbeing a triplet formed of two double-convex lenses of crown glass with\r\nan intermediary double concave lens of flint-glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Combinations of Early Dry Objectives.\r\n\r\n_A_, Double-convex lens; _B_, Plano-concave; _C_, Bi-convex and\r\nplano-concave united; shown in their various combinations, as at _D_,\r\nform the 3-in., 2-in. or 1-1/2-in.; at _E_, 1-in. and 2/3-in.; and at\r\n_F_, the 1/2-in., 4/10-in., 1/4-in. and 1/25-in. objectives.\r\n\r\nCombination _D_ was for many years known as the Norfolk Objective.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Lister’s Correction Collar, (in section).]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Ross constructed 1/4-inch achromatic objectives on\r\nLister’s formula than he discovered an error which had hitherto escaped\r\nattention, viz., that the thinnest cover-glass of an object produced\r\na considerable amount of refractive disturbance. A marked difference\r\nwas observed in the image when viewed with or without a cover-glass.\r\nThis difficulty was first met by the addition of a draw-tube to the\r\nmicroscope body. But as this also impaired the image, Lister overcame\r\nthe difficulty by mounting the front lens of the objective in a\r\nseparate tube made to fit over a second tube carrying the two pairs of\r\nlenses. This arrangement led up to his invention of the _screw-collar\r\nadjustment_, the mechanism for applying which is shown in Fig. 114. The\r\nanterior lens _a_ at the end of the tube is enclosed in a brass-piece\r\n_b_ containing the combination; the tube _a_, holding the lens nearest\r\nthe object, is then made to move up or down the cylinder _b_, thus\r\nvarying the distance, according to the thickness of the glass covering\r\nthe object, by turning the screw ring _c_, thus causing the one tube\r\nto slide over the other, and clamping them together when properly\r\nadjusted. An aperture is made in the tube _a_, within which is seen\r\na mark engraved on the cylinder, on the edge of which are two marks,\r\na longer and a shorter, engraved upon the tube. When the mark on the\r\ncylinder coincides with the longer mark on the tube, the adjustment\r\nis made for an uncovered object; and when the coincidence is with\r\nthe shorter mark, the proper distance is obtained to balance the\r\naberrations produced by a cover-glass the hundredth of an inch thick;\r\nsuch glass covers are now supplied. The adjustment should be tested\r\nexperimentally by moving the milled edge which separates or closes the\r\ncombinations, and at the same time using the fine adjusting screw of\r\nthe microscope. The difficulty associated with the cover-glass of old\r\nhas, by the introduction of the homogeneous immersion system, been very\r\nnearly eliminated. There still remains, however, a disturbing amount\r\nof residual colour aberration in the achromatic dry objective, and for\r\nthe correction of which Zeiss proposed mounting the several lenses on a\r\nmethod somewhat different to that so long in use in this country. Fig.\r\n115 shows an objective in which the screw-collar ring _b b_ is made\r\nto adjust the exact distance between the two back lenses placed at _a\r\na_. The value of the screw-collar is not questioned. It is difficult\r\nto obtain at all times cover-glasses of a perfectly uniform thickness;\r\nthey will vary, and therefore perfect definition must be obtained, as\r\nheretofore, by adjusting for each separate preparation while the object\r\nis under examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--The Continental Screw-collar Adjustment.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1842 the excellence of Andrew Ross’s achromatic objectives\r\nwere acknowledged, and his formula for their construction was\r\ngenerally followed. No doubt many of these early objectives of his\r\nmanufacture are still regarded as treasures. I possess a 1/2-inch\r\nand a 1/4-inch, which I believe to be comparable with any achromatic\r\nobjectives of the same apertures of the present day. These I have\r\nalways found most serviceable for histological work.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Mr. Wenham produced an achromatic objective of considerable\r\nachromatic value. This consisted of a single hemispherical front\r\ncombination, shown in the accompanying enlarged diagram, Fig. 116.\r\nWenham’s formula seems to have been generally adopted by Continental\r\nopticians, who sold these lenses at a reduction of price. In Paris,\r\nPrazmowski and Hartnack--I have had one of Hartnack’s earliest\r\nimmersions in use for many years--brought this form of objective to\r\ngreater perfection, and in 1867 Powell and Lealand adopted the single\r\nfront combination system in their early water-immersion objective,\r\nwhereby the focal distance was said to be “practically a constant\r\nquantity, while reduction of aperture by making the front lens\r\nthinner ensures a much greater working distance without affecting the\r\naberrations, since the first refraction takes place at the posterior\r\nor curved surface of the front lens, the removal of any portion of\r\nthickness at the anterior or plane surface simply cuts off zones of\r\nperipheral rays without altering the distance--any space being filled\r\nby the homogeneous immersion fluid, or by an extra thickness of\r\ncover-glass.”[21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--A Single Front Combination formulated by\r\nWenham for Messrs. Ross (enlarged).]\r\n\r\nGreat improvements were brought about by R. B. Tolles, of Boston,\r\n1874, in the objective, as well as in the optical and mechanical parts\r\nof the microscope, most of which, however, must be ascribed to the\r\ncriticisms and suggestions of amateur workers skilled in the exhibition\r\nof test-objects--the late Dr. Woodward of Washington, for example,\r\nwhose series of photographs of the more difficult frustules of diatoms\r\nhave rarely been surpassed. Such results were due to improvements made\r\nin the optical part of the microscope at his suggestion. He came to the\r\nconclusion, arrived at about the same time by mathematical scientists,\r\nthat increase of power in the microscope was only possible in two\r\ndirections, the qualitative and the quantitative.\r\n\r\nIt was now that microscopists turned to the late Professor Abbe for\r\nassistance in perfecting the objective in the dioptric direction. This,\r\nhe pointed out, must be looked for in further improvements in the art\r\nof glass-making.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments ultimately brought to light a mineral\r\nsubstance, _Fluorite_, which, when combined in the proper proportion,\r\none part to two of German crown and flint glass, was found to have\r\nthe qualities looked for, and to possess different relations of a\r\ndispersive and refractive power. From Professor Abbe’s researches,\r\nbegun in 1876, we have had the aperture of the objective greatly\r\nenlarged, and the homogeneous system brought into general use.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this date the best made objective merely approximated to\r\ncolour correction. Undoubtedly the chief object to be obtained was\r\nthe removal or diminution of the secondary colour aberration. This,\r\ntogether with other residual errors Abbe pointed out in 1880, led\r\nto the improvement of the optical quality of the glass used in the\r\nmanufacture of all optical instruments, the chief difficulties being\r\nsurmounted in the Jena glass factory, whereby a complete revolution\r\nwas effected in the microscopic objective. The apochromatic glasses\r\nof Zeiss, Powell, Beck, Ross, Watson, Swift, and other makers, in\r\nwhich the secondary spectrum has been totally eliminated, or only a\r\nnegligible tertiary spectrum remains--that is to say, the objectives\r\nof these makers--are now corrected for three spectrum rays, and not\r\ntwo, as in the older objectives; and only those who look forward for\r\nmaking further discoveries in the intimate structure of bacilli or for\r\nresolving the finest diatom markings can be said to fully appreciate\r\nthe importance and value of the investigations of the late Professor\r\nAbbe, and which have, so to speak, entirely changed old empirical\r\nviews as to the value of high aperture, and demonstrated that high\r\namplification, unless associated by proportionally high aperture,\r\nnecessarily produces untrue images of minute structures. It was he also\r\nwho introduced a practically perfect system of estimating apertures,\r\nknown as the “numerical aperture notation,” by which not only can an\r\naccurate comparison be made of the relative apertures of any series\r\nof objectives, whether dry or immersion, but their resolving power\r\nunder the various conditions of the kind of light employed. Their\r\npenetrating power and their illuminating power can now be estimated\r\nwith mathematical exactness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Diagram of an Apochromatic Combination.]\r\n\r\nThe practical advantages, then, secured by the adoption of the\r\nhomogeneous system were, on the whole, greater than any before made or\r\nbelieved to be possible, and when taken into account in connection with\r\nthe improvement of the eye-piece (also due to Abbe), almost perfect\r\nachromatism and homogeneity between objective, object, and eye-piece\r\nis secured, together with a sharp definition of the image over the\r\nwhole visual field. These, with an increase of working distance between\r\nthe object and the objective, and other important results, have been\r\nplaced within the reach of the microscopist by men of science, and the\r\noutcome is the general adoption of the homogeneous system, termed by\r\nCarl Zeiss, a fellow-worker with Abbe, the[22] apochromatic system of\r\nconstructing objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelative Merits of the English and German Objectives.\r\n\r\nAs to the relative merits of German-made objectives, no superiority can\r\nbe claimed for them over those made by English opticians.\r\n\r\nThe Continental form of the 1/12-inch oil-immersion objective, shown in\r\nFig. 118, on the scale of 6 to 1, consists of four systems of lenses,\r\nnamely, the front, a deep hemispherical crown lens of high refractive\r\nindex; the second front of the system, an achromatic lens of such a\r\nform that it gathers the light from the hemispherical front; the middle\r\nlens, a single meniscus; and the back an achromatised lens, the second\r\nfront of the back being connected in such a way as to compensate for\r\nthe spherical and chromatic aberrations of the front lens.\r\n\r\nThe first homogeneous immersion objective which came under my\r\nobservation was manufactured in the well-known Jena workshop of Carl\r\nZeiss, December, 1877. This had a very considerable increase of\r\n_numerical aperture_, upwards of 50 per cent.; a clear gain, as an\r\noil angle of even 110° proved to be of greater value than an angle of\r\n180° in air, while the resolving power of the objective was increased\r\nin like proportion. There does not at present appear to be a bar to\r\nthe construction of objectives of yet higher power, with increase of\r\naperture. The available course open in this direction is the further\r\ndiscovery of another vitreous material and a suitable immersion fluid\r\nwith an index of 1·8 or 1·9, and glass with a corresponding index,\r\nso as to ensure homogeneity of the combination. Zeiss asserts that\r\nin the more difficult departments of microscopical research the\r\napochromatic lenses will supplant the older objectives, yet there are\r\nmany problems in microscopy awaiting solution which do not demand\r\nthe highest attainable degree of perfection in the objective, and in\r\nthe majority of cases the older achromatic objective is all that is\r\nneedful, provided it is good of its kind. The achromatic objectives\r\nand eye-pieces of the older type have still an advantage, as, owing to\r\ntheir simpler construction, really good lenses of the class required\r\ncan be purchased at considerably lower prices than the objectives of\r\nthe new series. These, from being more complicated in construction,\r\ninvolve a greater amount of skilled manual labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.--The Continental 1/12-in. Oil-immersion\r\nCombination (enlarged diagram).]\r\n\r\nThe German glasses of to-day afford satisfactory evidence both of\r\nskill and workmanship displayed in their production. Their cost is\r\ngreater, then, for the reason given, as will be seen on reference to\r\nContinental catalogues. The dry series of objectives cost somewhat\r\nless, a 1/2-inch (numerical aperture 0·30) can be had for £1 10s., and\r\na 1/6-inch (numerical aperture 0·65) for £2. On the other hand, the\r\napochromatic series rapidly increase in price as the numerical aperture\r\napproaches the limit of numerical aperture 0·40. The best of Zeiss’s\r\nseries are the 12 mm. (1/2-inch) and the 3 mm. (1/8-inch), numerical\r\naperture 1·4, both of which possess the optical capacity assigned to\r\nthem. These objectives are undoubtedly the finest to be met with in\r\nthe workshop of any optician. Achromatic objectives of Continental\r\nmanufacture have been as much improved as those of English make by the\r\nintroduction of the newer varieties of glass, as already explained,\r\nwhile a new nomenclature has sprung up in consequence. We now have\r\nsemi-apochromatic and parachromatic. The German opticians have followed\r\nZeiss’s lead, since almost the same series of objectives are given\r\nin the catalogues of Leitz, Reichert, and Seibert, while the quality\r\nof both dry and immersion objectives is found to be much the same.\r\nThe low price of Reichert’s immersion objectives should be noted, as\r\ntheir performance is quite perfect. A 1/12-inch (numerical aperture\r\n1·30) of Leitz’s, with which I have worked at _bacteria_, has given\r\nme much satisfaction; supplied by Watson and Baker at £5. A 1/12-inch\r\ndry objective by the same maker (numerical aperture 0·87) costs £3,\r\nand a water immersion 1/12-inch (numerical aperture 1·10) £3 5s. Leitz\r\nreminds me that it requires a good lens of from six to seven hundred\r\nmagnifying power for the examination of bacteria. For this reason he\r\nhas constructed a new form of lens, a 1/10-inch oil-immersion of 2·5\r\nmm. focus, for the purpose of adding to the resources of bacteriology.\r\nThis lens necessarily has a lower magnification than his former\r\n1/12-inch oil-lens, but as it is less costly to manufacture it is\r\nsold at a smaller price. The before-mentioned 1/12-inch, with a No. 3\r\ncompensating eye-piece, gives a magnification of over seven hundred\r\nor eight hundred diameters. To secure the best results in using the\r\nhigher powers of Leitz’s, from No. 5 upwards, a cover-glass of 0·17 mm.\r\nin thickness should be used, and care taken to make the length of the\r\ndraw-tube equal to 170 mm. This length of tube should be adhered to\r\nin the use of this optician’s oil-immersion lenses. If the microscope\r\nbe provided with a nose-piece, the draw-tube should be drawn out to\r\n160 mm.; in its absence it should be set at 170 mm., a deviation of\r\n10 mm. or more from the correct tube-length deteriorates from the\r\nvalue of Leitz’s oil-immersion objectives as of other opticians. It is\r\nsuggested that the German apochromatic combination of three cemented\r\nlenses is that adopted by Steinheil long before, in the construction\r\nof his well-known hand-magnifier (see page 77, Fig. 51). Zeiss’s 3 mm.\r\nobjective has a triple front, balanced by two triple backs--in all\r\nnine lenses--a somewhat amplified diagram of which is represented in\r\nFig. 118. The formula for this combination was furnished by Tolles,\r\nof Boston, America, and it at once secured increase of aperture\r\n(the value of this optician’s many contributions to microscopy has\r\nsince his death been generally acknowledged). The metrical equivalent\r\nfocus assigned by Zeiss to his series of dry achromatic objectives is\r\ngiven in somewhat ambiguous terms, which tend to confuse rather than\r\nclassify them; for instance, two lenses of the same aperture--24 mm.\r\nand 16 mm.--corresponding to the English 1-inch and 2/3-inch, each have\r\nassigned to them an aperture of 0·30; a 12 mm. and 8 mm., corresponding\r\nto the English 1/2-inch and 1/3-inch, have an aperture of 0·65; while\r\na 6 mm. = 1/4-inch, and a 4 mm. = 1/4-inch and 1/6-inch, have each an\r\naperture of 0·95.\r\n\r\nNachet exhibited at the Antwerp Exhibition a fine 1/10-inch\r\noil-immersion, which was highly praised by the jurors.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, to make the fact perfectly clear, that dry and\r\nimmersion lenses having the same angular aperture have also a similar\r\ndefining power. The pencil of rays, however, differs in intensity\r\nand density as the rays emerging from the cover-glass of the object\r\ninto air are very considerably deflected, and the cone suffers a\r\ncorresponding loss of brightness. On this important point, then,\r\nI believe it will prove of value to interpolate a clear and full\r\nexposition of the change brought about by the cover-glass.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult, then, to perceive the importance of Amici’s\r\ndiscovery as to the value of a drop of water inserted between the\r\nobject and the objective, and it now seems somewhat surprising it\r\nshould have been so long neglected by opticians, since it is at once\r\nseen to diminish the reflection which takes place in the incidence of\r\noblique light. The film of water not only gives increased aperture,\r\nbut also greater cleanness and sharpness to the image. The film, then,\r\nas already shown, collects the straying away of peripheral rays of\r\nlight, and sends them on to the eye-piece, and greatly assists in\r\nrendering the image more perfect, and materially aids in the removal\r\nof residuary secondary aberrations; while with air, or dry objectives,\r\na certain amount of aberration takes place, sufficient to affect the\r\npencils on their passage from the radiant to the medium of the front\r\nlens, adding a considerable ratio to the total spherical aberration\r\nwith the objective, which, in the case of wide angles, increases\r\ndisproportionately from the axis outwards. This can only be corrected\r\nby a rough method of balancing; that is, by introducing an excess of\r\nopposite aberration in the posterior lens. An uncorrected residuum,\r\nrapidly increasing with larger apertures, is then left, and this\r\nappears in the image amplified by the total power of the objective, so\r\nthat with a non-homogeneous medium there is a maximum angular aperture\r\nwhich cannot be surpassed without undergoing a perceptible loss of\r\ndefinition, provided working distance is required. If we abolish the\r\nanterior aberration for all colours, by an immersion fluid which is\r\nequal to cover-glass in refractive and dispersive power, the difficulty\r\nis at once overcome. If, for instance, we have an objective of 140° in\r\nglass (= 1·25 N.A.) and water as the immersion fluid, the aberration in\r\nfront would affect a pencil of 140°. Substituting a homogeneous medium,\r\nthe same pencil, contracted to the equivalent angle in that medium\r\nof 112°, will be admitted to the front lens without any aberration,\r\nand may be made to emerge from the curved surface also without any\r\ndisturbing aberration, but contracted to an angle varying from 70° to\r\n90°. The first considerable spherical aberration of the pencil then\r\noccurs at the anterior surface of the _second_ lens, where the maximum\r\nobliquity of the rays is already considerably diminished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119_a_.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 119 and 119_a_ will doubtless make this clearer. If the objective\r\nof 140° works with water (Fig. 119), there would be a cone of rays\r\nextending up to 70° on both sides of the axis, _and this large cone\r\nwould be submitted to spherical aberration at the front surface a_.\r\nBut with homogeneous immersion (Fig. 119_a_) the whole cone of 112°\r\nis admitted to the front lens without any aberration, there being no\r\nrefraction at the plane surface; and as the spherical surface of the\r\nfront lens is without notable spherical aberration, the incident pencil\r\nis brought from the focus F to the conjugate focus F′, and contracted\r\nto an angle of divergence of 70°-90° _without having undergone any\r\nspherical aberration at all_.\r\n\r\nThe problem of correcting a very wide-angled objective has thus been\r\nreduced by the homogeneous oil-immersion system, both in theory and\r\npractice.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbe’s Test-plate.\r\n\r\nAbbe designed the test-plate (Fig. 120) for testing the spherical and\r\nchromatic aberrations of objectives, and estimating the thickness\r\nof cover-glasses corresponding to the most perfect correction: six\r\nglasses, having the exact thickness marked on each, 0·09 to 0·24 mm.,\r\ncemented in succession on a slip, their lower surface silvered and\r\nengraved with parallel lines, the contours of which form the test.\r\nThese being coarsely ruled are easily resolved by the lowest powers;\r\nyet, from the extreme thinness of the silver, they form also a delicate\r\ntest for objectives of the highest power and widest aperture. The\r\ntest-plate in its original size is seen in Fig. 120, with one of the\r\ncircles enlarged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--Abbe’s Test-plate for estimating thickness of\r\nglass-covers.]\r\n\r\nTo examine an objective of large aperture, the discs must be focussed\r\nin succession, observing in each case the quality of the image in the\r\ncentre of the field, and the variation produced by using, alternately,\r\ncentral and very oblique illumination.\r\n\r\nWhen the objective is perfectly corrected for spherical aberration,\r\nthe outlines of the lines in the centre of the field will be perfectly\r\nsharp by oblique illumination, and without any nebulous doubling or\r\nindistinctness of the edges. If, after exactly adjusting the objective\r\nfor oblique light, central illumination is used, no alteration of the\r\nfocus should be necessary to show the outlines with equal sharpness.\r\n\r\nIf an objective fulfils these conditions with any one of the discs,\r\nit is free from spherical aberration when used with cover-glasses\r\nof that thickness. On the other hand, if every disc shows nebulous\r\ndoubling, or an indistinct appearance of the edges of the line with\r\noblique illumination, or, if the objective requires a different focal\r\nadjustment to get equal sharpness with central as with oblique light,\r\nthe spherical correction of the objective is more or less imperfect.\r\n\r\nNebulous doubling with oblique illumination indicates over-correction\r\nof the marginal zone; indistinctness of the edges without marked\r\nnebulosity indicates under-correction of the zone; an alteration of\r\nthe focus for oblique and central illumination points to an absence of\r\nconcurrent action of the separate zones, which may be due to either an\r\naverage under or over correction, or to irregularity in the convergence\r\nof the rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Zeiss’s Cover-glass Gauge.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVER-GLASS GAUGE.\r\n\r\nZeiss has gone a step further to lay the microscopist’s ghost of the\r\ncover-glass. He invented a measurer (Fig. 121) whereby the precise\r\ndetermination of thickness of glass-covers can be obtained. This\r\nmeasurement is effected by a clip projecting from a circular box; the\r\nreading is given by an indicator moving over a divided circle on the\r\nlid of the box. The divisions seen cut round the circumference show\r\n1/100ths of a millimeter. This ingenious gauge measures upwards of 5\r\nmm.\r\n\r\nThis necessary and important digression has led me away from the\r\nconsideration of the achromatic objective, and to which I shall now\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Immersion and Dry Objectives.\r\n\r\nThe homogeneous immersion system met with its earliest as well as its\r\nstaunchest advocates among English opticians. Among its more energetic\r\nsupporters were Messrs. Powell and Lealand, who were the first to\r\nconstruct a 1/8-inch immersion objective on a formula of their own,\r\nand which was found to resolve test-objects not before capable of\r\nresolution by their dry objectives. This encouraged them to make a\r\n1/16-inch, acquired by Dr. Woodward for the Army Medical Department,\r\nWashington, and subsequently a 1/25-inch; neither of which surpassed\r\ntheir 1/8-inch in aperture, and a new formula was tried in the\r\nconstruction of their first oil-immersion objective. This had a duplex\r\nfront, and two double backs; but even this did not quite accomplish\r\nwhat was expected of it, and another change was subsequently made;\r\nthe anterior front combination became greater than a hemisphere--a\r\nballoon-lens. This at once gave an increase of aperture to a 1/12-inch\r\nobjective of 1·43 numerical aperture. After some few more trials a more\r\nimportant change of the formula took place. The front lens was made of\r\nflint-glass, and the combination took the form represented in diagram\r\n(Fig. 122). This, on an enlarged scale, represents Powell’s 1/12-inch\r\nnumerical aperture 1·50. It is a homogeneous apochromatic immersion\r\nof high quality and very flat field. It will be noticed that in this\r\ncombination the four curves of the lenses are very deep compared with\r\nthose of other opticians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--Powell and Lealand’s 1/12-in. Oil-immersion\r\nObjective, drawn on a scale of 6-1.]\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Ross_ have made many important improvements and changes in\r\nthe construction of their several series of achromatic objectives; the\r\ncalculations and formulæ for which were made exclusively for them by\r\nDr. Schrœder. The list is too long to quote, but most of these lenses\r\nare of a high-class character, and work with admirable precision.\r\nAmong the best of their objectives, I can commend a 1-inch of 30°\r\nand two oil-immersions, a 1/8-inch of 1·20 and a 1/12-inch of 1·25\r\nnumerical aperture, each of which bear the highest oculars equally\r\nwell; a good test, as I have always maintained, of excellence. Their\r\n1/10-inch has a somewhat larger aperture, and therefore shows a fine\r\nimage of the podura scale. The finish of Ross’s several series of\r\nobjectives fully maintains the high character and reputation of this\r\nold-established firm of opticians.\r\n\r\n_Messrs. R. and J. Beck_ have bestowed great attention upon the\r\nimprovement of their dry-objective series, much in demand for\r\nhistological work, especially among the students of city hospitals,\r\nwho usually commence their pathological work with the cheaper forms of\r\nobjectives. In that case an inch objective of about 25° air angle, a\r\n1/2-inch of not less than 40°, and a 1/4-inch or 1/5-inch magnifying\r\nfrom 50 to 250 diameters, is quite sufficient for most of their work.\r\nFor bacteriological research, Messrs. Beck supply a 1/6-inch immersion\r\ntaken from a series, having a high aperture and a better finish at a\r\nmoderate price. Their 1/10-inch immersion has in my hands proved a\r\nserviceable power for bacteriological research; it requires a good\r\nsub-stage illuminating achromatic condenser to obtain the best results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--1/6-in. English Combination, largely used.]\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Watson and Sons_ have much enhanced their reputation by\r\nthe marked improvement lately brought about in the manufacture of\r\ntheir whole series of objectives. This probably is chiefly due to\r\nthe introduction of the _Jena_ glass into their manufacture, and\r\nwhich has enabled them to give increase of aperture to one series in\r\nparticular, that of the para-chromatic, all of which in consequence are\r\nof very high quality. It is difficult to particularise their several\r\nobjectives, the whole having special features in proportion to their\r\nmagnifying powers, while much care seems to have been bestowed on them\r\nfor the elimination of residual colour. A 1/8-inch with correction\r\ncollar is comprised of a single deep and rather thick front lens,\r\nplano-concave flint, and double convex-crown for the middle and triple\r\ncombination for the back, the latter consisting of two crown lenses\r\ncemented to a dense flint (Fig. 124) drawn to scale of 5-1, with lined\r\nportions intended to represent the flint, and white the crown glass\r\nlenses of the combination. The initial magnification of this objective\r\nis 83 diameters, and the numerical aperture ·94. This superior\r\nobjective can be had for the small sum of £2. Another remarkably useful\r\nand cheap objective, their 1-inch numerical aperture 0·21, consists of\r\ntwo achromatic systems forming the front and back with the separation\r\nbetween them of about half an inch, and may also be especially\r\nrecommended for students’ work.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying diagram the lenses are drawn on too large a scale,\r\nand therefore the distance between the two combinations should be much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nAmong the more useful of Watson’s series, the 1-inch, the 1/2-inch, and\r\nthe 1/6-inch, together with the 1/8-inch dry-objective, and a 1/9-inch,\r\nwill be found the most serviceable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--Watson’s 1/8-in. Objective Para-chromatic\r\nCombination, scale 5-1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Watson’s 1-in. Achromatic Combination.]\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Baker_ have their own series of objectives, most of which\r\nare so very nearly allied to those of the continental opticians; and\r\nwhat has been said of Zeiss’s and Leitz’s objectives may be taken to\r\napply also to Baker’s, who have an established reputation for their\r\nhistological series, all of which are well suited for students’ and\r\nclass-room work.\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Swift and Son_ have a new series of objectives,\r\nsemi-apochromatic and pan-aplanatic, most of which are excellent\r\nin quality and show increased flatness of field together with that\r\nof achromatism; the index of refraction in each series having been\r\ncorrectly determined together with exact radial focal distance,\r\nthus affording more available aperture. I may select for special\r\ncommendation their 1/12-inch £5 5_s._ homogeneous immersion objective,\r\nwhich is in every way suitable for bacteriological work; its\r\ndefinition is very good, as is seen in a micro-photograph of podura\r\nscale, given further on. Their dry 1/6-inch can be had for £1 16_s._--a\r\nmarvel of cheapness. Of their general series the most useful for\r\nhistological work are the 1/2-inch, the 1/3-inch at £1 12_s._, and\r\ntheir 1/5-inch of numerical aperture 0·87 at £3.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Pillischer_, of Bond Street, has manufactured many excellent\r\nobjectives. A fine homogeneous oil-immersion 1/12-inch numerical\r\naperture 1·25 is worthy of special notice; it will be found suitable\r\nfor bacteriological work; it has fine definition with a considerable\r\namount of penetration.\r\n\r\nA more intelligent idea of the magnifying power of the objective\r\ncombined with the eye-piece will be gained by consulting the table\r\ngiven below; precision in this respect has long been a desideratum with\r\nmicroscopists.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnifying Powers of Eye-Pieces and Objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL AND INITIAL SELECTION OF POWERS OF EYE-PIECES CALCULATED FOR\r\nTHE 10-INCH TUBE-LENGTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUYGHENIAN EYE-PIECES.\r\n\r\n  NAME                 A         B      C      D      E      F\r\n  OF MAKER.         0 or No. 1   2      3      4      5      6\r\n\r\n  Baker                  6       8     12     15     --     --         Diameters.\r\n  Beck, R. & J.          4       8     15     20     25    not made.       \"\r\n  Leitz             5    6       7      8     10     12       \"            \"\r\n  Powell & Lealand       5       7·5   10     20     40       \"            \"\r\n  Reichert               2·5     3·5    4      5      6·5     \"            \" [24]\r\n  Ross                   3       8     12-1/2 20     25      40            \" [25]\r\n  Swift & Son            6       9     12     15     18      21            \"\r\n  Watson & Sons          4       6      8     10     12      15            \"\r\n  Zeiss                  3       4      5·5    7      9    not made.       \"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATING EYE-PIECES FOR USE WITH APOCHROMATIC OBJECTIVES.\r\n\r\n  Zeiss   2   4   8   12   18   27   Diameters.\r\n\r\nThis may be taken as a typical set, further treated of among Eye-pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nINITIAL POWERS OF OBJECTIVES CALCULATED FOR THE 10-INCH TUBE-LENGTH.\r\n\r\nThis is ascertained by dividing the distance of distinct vision 10\r\ninches by the focus of the objective, thus--\r\n\r\n  Focus-inches 4   3   2 1-1/2 1  2/3  1/2 4/10 1/4  1/5  1/6  1/8  1/12\r\n  Initial magnifying\r\n     power     2·5 3·3  5  7·5  10  15   20  25   40   50   60   80   120 diameters.\r\n\r\nA reference to the above table will at once show that the nomenclature\r\nof objectives expresses at once the initial magnifying powers, but as\r\nmakers have great difficulty in so calculating their formulæ so as to\r\nobtain the _exact_ power, these figures must be taken as approximate.\r\nThus a 1/4-inch, which should magnify 40 diameters if true to its\r\ndescription, might actually magnify a little more or less.\r\n\r\nThe magnifying powers of Zeiss’s and other apochromatic objectives\r\ncan be ascertained by dividing the focal length of the objective in\r\nmillimeters into 250 mm. (the distance of distinct vision), thus\r\n\r\n  Focus millimetres   24   16   12   4   3   2  1·5\r\n  Initial magnifying\r\n      power          10·5 15·5  21  63  83  125 167 diameters.\r\n\r\nThe total magnification, when any eye-piece is working in conjunction\r\nwith an objective, is ascertained by multiplying the initial power of\r\nthe objective by that of the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nThe above calculations are all for a 10-inch tube-length. Should,\r\nhowever, a shorter or longer length of body be employed, the\r\nmagnification can at once be ascertained by a proportion sum. If the\r\nmagnification be 180 with 10-inch tube-length, what would it be with a\r\n6-inch body--10 : 6 :: 180 = 108 diameters.\r\n\r\nAbbe designed three different forms of eye-pieces: 1, the searcher\r\neye-piece; 2, the working eye-piece; and 3, the projecting eye-piece.\r\nThe _Searcher_ is a negative form of low power. The working is both\r\nnegative and positive, the positive form of which is constructed\r\non a newer principle; while the projection is chiefly intended\r\nfor microphotography, its field being small and its definition\r\nsuperlatively sharp. These are severally explained among eye-pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh-Power Objectives.\r\n\r\n_Points of Importance for securing the best results with High-power\r\nObjectives._--Always give to the body-tube of the microscope the\r\nlength for which the objective is corrected, 0·160 mm. for the short\r\ncontinental tube, and 0·250 mm. for the English tube (10-inch). Employ\r\nboth dry and immersion objectives mounted for correction, commencing\r\nwith a numerical aperture of 0·75 (that is about 100° in air). If the\r\ngraduation is not given in thickness of cover-glass apply to the maker\r\nto correct this omission.\r\n\r\nWith the homogeneous oil-immersion objective it is highly necessary to\r\nutilise all marginal pencils of light, to optically unite the upper\r\nlens of the condenser with the preparation as well as the front lens of\r\nthe objective by means of a liquid having the same index of refraction\r\nor at least equal to that of the immersion. _Cedar Oil_ has been\r\ngenerally adopted for the purpose mentioned, the better way of using\r\nwhich is as follows: place a drop on the centre of the front objective,\r\nor on the top of the cover-glass, and then lower the objective by means\r\nof the coarse adjustment until it comes in contact with the oil, and\r\ncarefully bring into focus by the fine adjustment. If the slide is held\r\nbetween the finger and thumb of one hand and moved from side to side,\r\nwhile the other hand is working the fine adjustment, there can be no\r\ndanger of injuring either the objective or the specimen. Before putting\r\nthe microscope away, take a fine camel-hair brush dipped in ether,\r\nalcohol, or methylated spirit, and carefully remove the oil from the\r\nobjective and the glass cover of the object; a soft chamois leather or\r\ncambric pocket handkerchief will dry it off, or a piece of fine white\r\nblotting paper answers equally well. Should the lens come accidentally\r\ninto contact with the Canada balsam, it must be very carefully removed\r\neither by ether or alcohol. The former is by far the safest, as\r\nalcohol, if not very carefully used, quickly dissolves out the balsam\r\nand loosens the cover-glass of the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nAchromatic Condensers.\r\n\r\n_The Achromatic Condenser_ can no longer be classed among the\r\n_accessories_ of the microscope, since it is an absolutely\r\nindispensable part of its optical arrangements. Its value, then,\r\ncannot be overrated, and the corrections of the lenses which enter\r\ninto the construction of the condenser should be made as perfect as\r\nthey can be made--in fact, as nearly approaching that of the objective\r\nas it is possible to make them. It may therefore be of interest to\r\nknow something of the rise and progress of the achromatic condenser.\r\nIn my first chapter I have noticed the earlier attempts made by Dr.\r\nWollaston, whose experiments led him to fit to the underside of the\r\nstage of his microscope a short tube, in which a plano-convex lens\r\nof about three-quarters of an inch focal length was made to slide\r\nup and down (afterwards moved up and down by two knobs); to improve\r\ndefinition he placed a stop between the mirror and the lens. The stop\r\nwas found to act better when placed between the lens and the object.\r\nFrom this improvement Dr. Wollaston enunciated that “the intensity of\r\nillumination will depend upon the diameter of the illuminating lens and\r\nthe proportion of the image to the perforation, and may be regulated\r\naccording to the wish of the observer.” Dujardin in France and Tully\r\nin England were at work in the same direction. The former a year or\r\ntwo later on contrived an instrument, which he termed an _eclairage_,\r\nto remedy the defects of Wollaston’s, and for illuminating objects\r\nwith achromatic light. This was submitted for approval to Sir David\r\nBrewster, who, when the use of the achromatic condenser was first\r\nbroached, used these encouraging words:--“I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that the apparatus for illumination requires to be as perfect\r\nas the apparatus for vision, and on this account I would recommend\r\nthat the illuminating lens should be perfectly free from chromatic and\r\nspherical aberration, and that the greatest care be taken to exclude\r\nall extraneous light both from the object and eye of the observer.”\r\nThis far-seeing observer in optical science has borne good fruit,\r\nand the outcome of his views is seen in the great development and\r\nimprovement of the achromatic condenser. In 1839 Andrew Ross made his\r\nfirst useful form of condenser, and gave rules for the illumination\r\nof objects in an article written for the “Penny Cyclopædia.” These,\r\nepitomised, read as follows: 1. That the illuminating cone should equal\r\nthe aperture of the objective, and no more. 2. With daylight, a white\r\ncloud being in focus, the object has to be placed nearly at the apex\r\nof the cone. The object is seen better sometimes above and sometimes\r\nbelow the apex of the cone. 3. With lamplight a bull’s-eye lens is\r\nto be used, to parallelise the rays, so that they may be similar to\r\nthose coming from the white cloud. It has been seen that Mr. Lister\r\nforeshadowed the sub-stage condenser.\r\n\r\nThe early form of Ross’s condenser consists of two small brass tubes\r\nmade to slide one in the other. To the outer one is attached a flat\r\nbrass plate which slides underneath the stage of the microscope, and\r\nby means of a screw the adjustment of the axis of the illuminator is\r\neffected. The upper portion of the apparatus carries the achromatic\r\ncombination, which by a rack and pinion movement is brought nearer to,\r\nor removed further from the object on the stage. The several parts of\r\nthe illuminator unscrew, so that the lenses may be used either combined\r\nfor high powers, or separated for low powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.--Original form of Gillett’s Achromatic\r\nCondenser.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Smith & Beck greatly improved upon Ross’s condenser by adding\r\nanother achromatic lens to the combination, three being employed when\r\nused with high-power objectives and two or even one with the lower,\r\nthe adjustment and focussing being made by rack and pinion arrangement\r\nbeneath the stage. Some further changes for the better were made in the\r\ncondenser by Powell, and in 1850 an amateur microscopist, Mr. Gillett,\r\nfully grasping the value of controlling the cone of rays passing into\r\nthe microscope, devised a new form of condenser, in connection with\r\nwhich a revolving series of diaphragms of different values were made\r\nto pass between the achromatic lenses and the source of light.\r\n\r\nAndrew Ross constructed the first condenser on Gillett’s principle,\r\nand this proved to be one of the most successful pieces of apparatus\r\ncontrived. _Gillett’s Condenser_ consists of an achromatic lens _c_,\r\nabout equal to an object-glass of one quarter of an inch focal length,\r\nwith an aperture of 80°. This lens is screwed into the top of a brass\r\ntube, and intersecting which, at an angle of about 25°, is a circular\r\nrotating brass plate _a b_, provided with a conical diaphragm, having\r\na series of circular apertures of different sizes _h g_, each of which\r\nin succession, as the diaphragm is rotated, proportionally limits the\r\nlight transmitted through the illuminating lens. The circular plate\r\nin which the conical diaphragm is fixed is provided with a spring and\r\ncatch _e f_, the latter indicating when an aperture is central with\r\nthe illuminating lens, also the number of the aperture as marked on\r\nthe graduated circular plate. Three of these apertures have central\r\ndiscs for circularly oblique illumination, allowing only the passage\r\nof a hollow cone of light to illuminate the object. The illuminator\r\nabove described is placed in the secondary stage _i i_, which is\r\nsituated below the general stage of the microscope, and consists\r\nof a cylindrical tube having a rotatory motion, also a rectangular\r\nadjustment, which is effected by means of two screws _l m_, one in\r\nfront, and the other on the left side of its frame. This tube receives\r\nand supports all the various illuminating and polarising apparatus, and\r\nother auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n_Directions for using Gillett’s Condenser._--In the adjustment of the\r\ncompound body of the microscope for using with Gillett’s illuminator,\r\none or two important points should be observed--first, centricity; and\r\nsecondly, the fittest compensation of the light to be employed. With\r\nregard to the first, place the illuminator in the cylindrical tube,\r\nand press upwards the sliding bar _k_ in its place, until checked\r\nby the stop; move the microscope body either vertically or inclined\r\nfor convenient use; and, with the rack and pinion which regulates\r\nthe sliding bar, bring the illuminating lens to a level with the\r\nupper surface of the object-stage; then move the arm which holds the\r\nmicroscope body to the right, until it meets the stop, whereby its\r\ncentral position is attained; adjust the reflecting mirror so as to\r\nthrow light up the illuminator, and place upon the mirror a piece of\r\nclean white paper to obtain a uniform disc of light. Then put on the\r\nlow eye-piece, and a low power (the half-inch), as more convenient\r\nfor the mere adjustment of the instrument; place a transparent\r\nobject on the stage, adjust the microscope-tube, until vision is\r\nobtained of the object; then remove the object, and take off the cap\r\nof the eye-piece, and in its place fix on the eye-glass called the\r\n“centring eye-glass,”[26] which will be found greatly to facilitate\r\nthe adjustment now under consideration, namely, the centring of the\r\ncompound body of the microscope with the illuminating apparatus of\r\nwhatever description. The centring-glass, being thus affixed to\r\nthe top of the eye-piece, is adjusted by its sliding-tube (without\r\ndisturbing the microscope-tube) until the images of the diaphragms in\r\nthe object-glass and centring lens are distinctly seen. The illuminator\r\nshould now be moved by means of the left-hand screw on the secondary\r\nstage while looking through the microscope, to enable the observer to\r\nrecognize the diaphragm belonging to the illuminator, and by means\r\nof the two adjusting screws to place this diaphragm central with\r\nthe others: thus the first condition, that of centricity, will be\r\naccomplished. Remove the white paper from the mirror, and also the\r\ncentring-glass, and replace the cap on the eye-piece, also the object\r\non the stage, of which distinct vision should then be obtained by\r\nthe rack and pinion, or fine screw adjustment, should it have become\r\nderanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.--The Ross Improved Achromatic Condenser, with\r\ndiaphragm stops.]\r\n\r\nThe re-publication of the original directions is given with the view\r\nof showing what a clear conception Gillett had of the value of his\r\ninvention. The careful directions given for centring must be regarded\r\nwith interest, although nearly superseded by the centring screw\r\narrangement in connection with the sub-stage. The best results, he\r\ngoes on to say, will be secured by using the plain mirror and focussing\r\nthe window-bar on the object, while a white-cloud illuminator will\r\nafford as much light as may be required. It is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat direct light is more critical than indirect. As a rule, the\r\nstudent is given to over-illuminate the object. These questions will,\r\nhowever, be discussed further on.\r\n\r\nVery many modifications of Gillett’s condenser have, since 1850, become\r\nknown to microscopists. Ross’s present improved form (Fig. 127) is\r\nmade to drop into the sub-stage of the microscope, and when adjusted,\r\nis an extremely efficient instrument. The optical part is similar to\r\na 4/10-inch objective. It has two sets of revolving diaphragms, with\r\napertures and stops for showing surface markings in a perfect manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbe’s Condenser.\r\n\r\nThe essential feature of this condenser is its short focus, which\r\ncollects the light reflected by the mirror, so as to form a cone of\r\nrays of very large aperture, having its focus in the plane of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.--The Iris Diaphragm, and carrier for Stops.]\r\n\r\nThe full aperture of the illuminating cone should only be used when\r\nfinely granular and deeply stained particles (protoplasm, bacteria,\r\n&c.) are being examined with objectives of large aperture. In all\r\ncases the cone must be suitably reduced, either by an iris, or other\r\nform of diaphragm (_central illumination_). By placing the diaphragm\r\nexcentrically, by means of rack-work attached to the carrier, the\r\ncentral rays are excluded and a certain extra-axial portion of the\r\nilluminating pencil falls upon the object (_oblique illumination_).\r\nWhen the diaphragm is thus excentrically placed, this oblique pencil\r\ncan be directed from all sides by rotating the carrier round the optic\r\naxis. The central stop diaphragm shuts off all the axial and transmits\r\nonly the marginal rays, thus producing _dark-ground illumination_. The\r\niris diaphragm (Fig. 128) is so shaped that the edge of its smallest\r\nopening closely approximates the object-slide on the stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.--The Abbe Condenser, detached from the\r\nSub-stage of the Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe Abbe condenser is the most popular form in use, for all purposes.\r\nOwing to the large aperture of the cone of light which it projects,\r\nit can be employed with the highest powers; by removing the top lens\r\nit can also be used with low powers. Dark ground illumination may be\r\nobtained with it up to a 1/4-inch objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--Optical Arrangement of Abbe Illuminator, 1·2\r\nN.A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Optical Arrangement of Abbe Illuminator, 1·4\r\nN.A.]\r\n\r\nThe condenser is made in two forms of 1·2 and 1·4 numerical aperture\r\nby Messrs. Watson. The lenses are mounted in aluminium. Fig. 130 is\r\nin more general use, but by workers with high powers Fig. 131 is\r\npreferred, as it ensures the most oblique illumination with objectives\r\nof largest aperture. It is preferred for photo-micrographic purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.--The Optical Arrangement of Watson’s\r\nAchromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\n_Watson’s Achromatic Condenser_ (Fig. 132), 1·0 numerical aperture,\r\nshown in section, although originally designed for use with the\r\nmicro-spectroscope, is equally efficient for ordinary purposes. This\r\ncondenser transmits a larger aplanatic cone of light than Abbe’s.\r\nIt may therefore be employed with higher power objectives, and by\r\nremoving the top lens it is just as useful a condenser for lower\r\npowers. Being constructed with lenses of an unusually large size, it is\r\nwell adapted for use with the micro-spectroscope. It is certainly one\r\nof the best all-round condensers in use. The new Schott glass enters\r\ninto the construction of the lenses, and these are mounted in aluminium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.--Powell’s Achromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\nMany microscopists consider on the whole that Powell’s sub-stage\r\napochromatic condenser with collar correction (Fig. 133) surpasses\r\nthat of Abbe. The mechanical arrangement of Powell’s is very simple:\r\nthe correction collar is similar to that of an ordinary objective, it\r\nhas a steeper spiral slot and only half a revolution of movement; a\r\nlong arc is fixed to the collar so that it may conveniently be reached\r\nby the finger. It is so constructed as to turn easily and smoothly\r\nat the slightest touch. The collar moves only the back lens of the\r\ncombination, leaving the mount rigid. The diaphragms are regulated by A\r\nand B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134_b_.--Powell’s Apochromatic Oil Immersion\r\nCondenser, N.A. 1·40.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the correctional movement is to increase the maximum\r\naplanatic aperture of the condenser by separating the lenses. If\r\nthe back of a wide-angled objective be examined when an object is\r\nilluminated by the full aperture of the condenser, the edge of the\r\nflame being in focus, it will be noticed that the illuminated portion\r\nof the back lens will be oval and pointed instead of circular. Also\r\nthat when the condenser is racked up, although the external shape of\r\nthe illuminated portion becomes more circular, two dark patches will\r\nappear on either side of the centre, showing the operation of the\r\nspherical aberration of the condenser. If under these circumstances\r\nthe lenses are separated by means of the collar adjustment, the black\r\nspots will be closed up, and a circular and evenly-illuminated disc of\r\nillumination of a larger size will result. The wheel of diaphragms,\r\nor a series of graduated diaphragm discs to drop into a holder, is\r\nintended for critical work; the diaphragm can always be recorded, and\r\nthe identical illuminating cone reproduced.\r\n\r\nHence we have a simple method of graduating apertures between any two\r\ncontiguous diaphragms; if, for example, we place the lever to the left,\r\nso that the lens may be separated as far as possible, and use a No.\r\n6 diaphragm, and if, on examining the object, it is thought that the\r\nilluminating cone is not large enough, and if when No. 7 is turned\r\non it is found too much, we can go back to No. 6, and by turning the\r\nlever 60° towards the right, closing the lenses and increasing the\r\npower a little, we shall obtain an aperture somewhere between Nos. 6\r\nand 7 diaphragm. Thus we can by means of the correction collar graduate\r\nthe aperture with the facility as with an iris, and we can record any\r\nparticular aperture with a degree of accuracy foreign to the iris. It\r\nmust be admitted, however, that the cone of light transmitted by the\r\ncondenser is a very small one.\r\n\r\nPowell also supplies an apochromatic oil-immersion condenser, numerical\r\naperture 1·40, but without collar correction; Fig. 134 shows the\r\nsliding tube lowered by arm A and cell B withdrawn for changing stops,\r\nwhich can be done without altering the focus of the condenser. Fig.\r\n134_a_ shows the cell B closed and raised by arm A close to the back\r\nlens of optical combination. In Fig. 134_b_ six of the principal stops\r\nare shown. Powell’s dry apochromatic condenser, of nearly 0·9 aplanatic\r\ncone, is also very good; but the high price of all is a bar to their\r\nmore general use. The speciality of these is the conversion of axis\r\nlight into condensed oblique incident light by the refraction of the\r\ncondenser.\r\n\r\nMessrs. R. & J. Beck have various forms of achromatic condensers, some\r\nof which partake of a somewhat elaborate arrangement; others are simple\r\nand inexpensive, to suit the students’ microscope; as when the light of\r\nthe concave mirror proves insufficient for any object requiring intense\r\ntransmitted light, an achromatic condenser must be adapted to even the\r\nstudents’ form of microscope. The latest form of condenser (Fig. 135)\r\nis fitted with revolving stops and iris diaphragm, and other appliances\r\nfor obtaining satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.--Beck’s newer form of Achromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\n_Beck’s Compound Illuminating Apparatus_ (Fig. 136).--It is useful\r\nin working with the microscope to be enabled to rapidly change the\r\nillumination, and for this reason this compound form of condenser has\r\nbeen constructed. It consists of an upper portion A, a wide-angle\r\ncondenser, the aperture of which can be reduced at will by an iris\r\ndiaphragm, moved by the lever B. This can be used for all other\r\npurposes. Below this diaphragm is a plate C, which can be swung back\r\nout of position at will, as shown in outline. Into a cell in this\r\nplate the stops D can be dropped, and the condenser can be used for\r\ndark field illumination, or for high powers as an oblique illuminator.\r\nA large-size polarising prism E, fastens to the plate C, and can be\r\nremoved when not required. In this way any of the various modes of\r\nillumination may be separately or conjointly obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--Beck’s Compound Condenser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--Beck’s Spherical Achromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\nTheir condenser (Fig. 137) has a large aperture, and facilities for\r\nrotating the series of diaphragms. It is available for either dry or\r\nimmersion objectives up to 1·3 numerical aperture on diatoms, and wet\r\nor dry histological objects. The spherical form of the front is worked\r\nby a milled-head that rotates a series of lenses and diaphragms. It\r\nalso avoids the inconvenience of having the connecting fluid drawn away\r\nby capillary attraction, as would be the case if mounted on a flat\r\nsurface. It is also less in the way of the sub-stage movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--Watson’s Parachromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\n_The Parachromatic Condenser_ of Messrs. Watson (Fig. 138) was made to\r\nmeet a demand for a condenser giving a large solid cone of illumination\r\nfree from colour. The optical part of this condenser consists of a\r\nfull hemispherical front lens, and the middle and back combinations of\r\nsuch forms as to produce the necessary corrections. The Jena phosphate\r\ncrown and silicate flints are used in its manufacture, and to these\r\nare due its special qualities. The total aperture of the condenser is\r\n1·0, and it yields an aplanatic aperture of ·90 numerical aperture. The\r\nmagnifying power is 2/7ths of an inch. From this it will be seen that\r\nit is especially suitable for use with high-power objectives.\r\n\r\nIt can also be employed without the front lens, when the magnifying\r\npower is 4/10ths of an inch, and the numerical aperture ·35. It is\r\nmounted in an exceedingly convenient manner, the iris diaphragm being\r\nfitted in such a way as to be absolutely central with the optical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe arc through which the handle controlling the iris travels is\r\ndivided, and indicates the aperture at which the condenser may be\r\nworking at any time. An important feature in this condenser is that it\r\nis almost wholly free from colour. As a rule condensers of the same\r\nform are found difficult to work with, because of the small diameter of\r\nthe field or back lens. This difficulty has been successfully overcome\r\nby increasing the size of this lens, and the whole of which is fully\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\nMost London opticians have their own especial form of achromatic\r\ncondenser, designed for and fitted to their several stands and\r\nobjectives, varying from a small price to the more expensively-fitted\r\naccessories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.--Swift’s Illuminating Polarising Apparatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139_a_.--Swift’s Diaphragms and Central Stops.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Swift’s illuminating apparatus (Fig. 139) is conveniently\r\nsupplied with numerous useful appliances. The optical combination A is\r\ncomputed to be used as an effective spot lens from a 3-inch objective\r\nup to a sixth. C C are two small milled heads by means of which the\r\noptical combination A is centred to the axis of the objective. The\r\nrevolving diaphragm E has four apertures for the purpose of receiving\r\ncentral stops, oblique light discs, and selenite films. D is a frame\r\ncarrying two revolving cells, into one of which a mica film is placed,\r\nwhich can be revolved with ease over either of the selenites below,\r\nwhereby changes of colour can be obtained in experimenting with\r\npolarised light. The darts and P A’s indicate the position of the\r\npositive axis of the mica and selenite films, and by this means results\r\ncan be recorded, etc. Either of the revolving cells can be thrown into\r\nthe centre of the condenser, and there stopped by means of a spring\r\ncatch; when so arranged the mica film, &c., may be revolved in its\r\nplace by turning the cell D, as both cells are geared together with\r\nfine racked teeth. F is a polarising prism mounted on an eccentric\r\narm, rendered central when in use, or thrown out, as seen, when out of\r\nuse. G is the rack dove-tail slide for indicating and focussing the\r\ncondenser on the object. The advantages associated with this condenser\r\nconsist in having the polarising prism, selenite films, dark-ground,\r\nand oblique light stops, so that they may be brought close under the\r\noptical combination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.--Baker’s Nelson Achromatic Condenser.]\r\n\r\nBaker’s Nelson Condenser, shown in Fig. 140, is intended for use with\r\ntheir medium instruments. It has, however, many pieces of apparatus\r\nessential to those of a higher class. It is applicable, indeed, to all\r\ninstruments having sufficient depth beneath the stage to receive it. It\r\ncomprises an achromatic combination of 90° aperture, available with all\r\npowers up to 1/8-inch tinted glass for neutralising the yellow rays of\r\nartificial light, focussing adjustment, dark-ground illuminator, large\r\ndiaphragm with rotating tube to carry oblique light stops, small wheel\r\nof apertures, polarising prism with two selenite films, clear aperture,\r\nand oblique light-shutter for low powers.\r\n\r\nBaker’s Students’ Condenser (Fig. 141) is designed to take the place of\r\nAbbe’s, and costs much less. It transmits a larger aplanatic cone of\r\nlight, and can be used either with high or low powers by removing the\r\nfront lens. It is equally useful for photo-micrographic work.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Mayall’s semi-cylinder or prism for oblique illumination (Fig.\r\n142) is a convenient form, as it permits of the semi-cylinder being\r\ntilted and placed excentrically; in this manner, without immersion\r\ncontact, and by suitable adjustment, a dry object can be viewed\r\nwith any colour of monochromatic light. If placed in immersion\r\ncontact with the slide, the utmost obliquity of incident light can\r\nbe obtained. Objects in fluid may be placed on the plane-surface of\r\nthe semi-cylinder, and illuminated by ordinary transmitted light, or\r\nrendered “self-luminous” in a dark field, as with the hemispherical\r\nilluminator or Wenham’s immersion paraboloid. A concave mirror with a\r\ndouble arm is quite sufficient to direct the illuminating pencil. This\r\nsemi-cylinder was originally made by Tolles, of Boston, for measuring\r\napertures, but, at Mr. Mayall’s suggestion, Messrs. Ross mounted it as\r\nan illuminator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--Optical Arrangement of Baker’s Abbe\r\nCondenser.]\r\n\r\nThe spiral slot should be fixed close beneath the larger lens of the\r\ncondenser, and when properly arranged will be found a convenient mode\r\nof obtaining oblique light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Mayall’s Semi-Cylinder Illuminator and Spiral\r\nDiaphragms.]\r\n\r\n_The Webster-Collins Universal Condenser_ (Fig. 143) is so well\r\nknown that it scarcely calls for any lengthy description. It is an\r\ninexpensive form of condenser, designed in the first instance for use\r\nwith the students’ microscope. It is fitted into the sub-stage; has an\r\niris diaphragm as well as a series of revolving diaphragms moved by a\r\nmilled head screw arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--The Webster-Collins Universal Condenser.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOblique Illumination.\r\n\r\n_Wenham’s Parabolic Condenser._--Mr. Wenham’s many useful additions\r\nto the microscope and its accessories demand especial notice. When\r\nmention is made of the various immersion condensers (illuminators,\r\nas he preferred to call them), his original right-angled prism, his\r\ntruncated hemispherical lens, his immersion paraboloid, and his reflex\r\nilluminator, in which rays beyond the angle of total reflexion are\r\nutilised by reflex action from cover-glass on to the surface of the\r\nobject, every one of these well-devised inventions will always be\r\nspoken of in terms of praise. All in their turn conferred a great\r\nservice upon the microscope, and enabled the student to clear up\r\ndifficulties that stood in the way of developing structure when\r\nachromatic lenses and dry-objectives were considered perfect. The\r\nsuperior illumination of the object was wholly due to, and effected by,\r\n_reflected_ rays from the object to the aperture of the objective, and\r\nobviously, reflex action could only take place with dry-objectives.\r\nThis reflex action must be regarded as Mr. Wenham’s special discovery.\r\nIt must be observed, however, that it is not the same as the more\r\nmodern achromatic appliances used for throwing _direct_ rays upon the\r\nobject, and which proved the existence of apertures capable of direct\r\ntransmission up to 27° measured in the body of the front lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--Wenham’s Parabolic Reflector.]\r\n\r\nThe most practical of Mr. Wenham’s inventions is probably the\r\nhemispherical lens, since adopted by Messrs. Ross in connection with\r\ntheir excellent Zentmayer stand, and which has proved eminently\r\nserviceable. But the fact is that devices of the kind for obtaining\r\ndirect oblique light require a thin stage, and therefore most of those\r\nwho possess the earlier-made microscope stand would doubtless hail\r\nthe appearance of any appliance which will convert axial light into\r\noblique light; as by so doing the possessors of such instruments, in\r\nwhich the stage is generally of considerable thickness, would enjoy the\r\npleasure of seeing the best resolution it is possible to get with their\r\ndry-objectives.[27]\r\n\r\n_Wenham’s Parabolic Reflector._--This will be better understood by\r\nreference to Fig. 145, which represents it in section A B C, and shows\r\nthat the rays of light _r r′ r′′_, entering perpendicularly at its\r\nsurface C, and then reflected by its parabolic surface A B to a focus\r\nat F, can form no part of the largest pencil of light admitted by the\r\nobject-glass and represented by G F H; but an object placed at F will\r\ninterrupt the rays and be strongly illuminated. A stop at S prevents\r\nany light from passing through direct from the mirror.\r\n\r\nIn the microscope the _parabolic reflector_ fits into the cylindrical\r\nfitting under the stage, and the adjustment of its focus upon the\r\nobject is made by giving it a spiral motion when fitted in--that is,\r\ncarefully pushing it up or down at the same time that it is turned\r\nround by the milled edge B B. It must then be focussed by the rack\r\nand pinion motion. As the rays of light must be parallel when they\r\nenter it, a _flat mirror_, which in this case should be added to the\r\ninstrument, is generally used; daylight will then require only direct\r\nreflection, but the rays from an artificial source will have to be made\r\nparallel by placing a side condenser between the light and the mirror,\r\nabout 1-3/4 inch from the former and 4-1/2 inches from the latter.\r\nNearly the whole surface of the mirror should be equally illuminated;\r\nthis may be tested by temporarily placing upon it a card or piece\r\nof white paper. Parallel rays can also be obtained from the concave\r\nmirror, if the light is placed about 2-1/2 inches from it. Dark-ground\r\nillumination is not suitable for very transparent objects--that is,\r\nunless there is a considerable difference in their index of refraction,\r\nor they are pervaded by air-cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--Parabolic Reflector.]\r\n\r\nOne very remarkable example of this may be seen in the tracheal system\r\nof insects. If any of the transparent larvæ of the various kinds of\r\ngnat be mounted in gelatine and glycerine jelly, slightly warmed\r\nbut not enough to kill the insect outright, about the third day the\r\nfluids circulating in the body will be absorbed and replaced by air.\r\nIlluminated by the parabolic condenser, and viewed with a binocular\r\nmicroscope, and a low power, the gnat-larva becomes a superb object.\r\nThe body of the insect is but faintly visible, and in its place is\r\ndisplayed a marvellous tracheal skeleton, with the tubes standing out\r\nin perspective, shining brilliantly, like a structure of burnished\r\nsilver. Unfortunately, such objects are not permanent, for when the\r\nwhole of the water dries up, the tracheal tubes either collapse or\r\nbecome refilled with fluid.\r\n\r\nAs to the blackness of field, and luminosity of the object, this\r\ndepends upon excess of light from the paraboloid received beyond the\r\nangle of aperture of the object-glass. It is found in practice that\r\nmore and more of the inner annulus of rays from the paraboloid has\r\nto be stopped off, until at last, with high-angled objectives, it is\r\nscarcely possible to obtain a black field.\r\n\r\nThe light, on the whole, most suitable for this method of illumination\r\nis lamp, the rays of which should in all cases be rendered more\r\nparallel by means of a large plano-convex lens, or condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--Wenham’s Hemispherical Lens.]\r\n\r\n_Wenham’s Immersion Condenser._--Mr. Wenham, in the year 1856,\r\ndescribed various forms of oblique illuminators, one of which was an\r\nimmersion; a simple right-angled prism, connected by a fluid medium of\r\noil of cloves. This, however, was abandoned for a nearly hemispherical\r\nlens connected with the slide, and although an improvement, did not\r\ntouch the point of excellence Mr. Wenham was looking for. Ultimately\r\nhe adopted a semi-circular disc of glass of the exact form and size\r\nrepresented in the drawing, Fig. 146, having a quarter-inch radius,\r\nwith a well-polished rounded edge, the sides being grasped by a simple\r\nkind of open clip attached to the sub-stage, the fluid medium used\r\nfor connecting the upper surface with the slide being either water,\r\nglycerine, or oil; an increase of oblique illumination being obtained\r\nby swinging the ordinary mirror sideways. By means of an illuminator of\r\nthe kind difficult objects mounted in balsam are resolved. This simple\r\npiece of glass collects and concentrates light in a marvellous manner,\r\nand is by no means a bad substitute for some of the more costly forms\r\nof achromatic condenser. It can be used either in fluid contact with\r\nthe slide, or dry, as an ordinary condenser.\r\n\r\nMr. Wenham subsequently contrived a small truncated glass paraboloid,\r\nfor use in fluid contact with the slide; water, glycerine, oil, or\r\nother substance being employed as a contact medium. The rays of light\r\nin this illuminator, being internally reflected from a convex surface\r\nof glass, impinge obliquely on the under surface of the slide, and\r\nare transmitted by the fluid uniting medium, and internally reflected\r\nfrom the upper surface of the cover-glass to the objective. To use the\r\nreflex illuminator efficiently it must be racked up to a level with the\r\nstage. The centre of rotation is then set true by a dot on the fitting,\r\nseen with a low power, a drop of water is then placed on the top, and\r\nupon this the slide is laid. Minute objects _on the slide_ must be\r\nfound either by the aid of a low power, by their greater brilliancy, or\r\nby rotating the illuminator; the effect on the podura scale is superb,\r\nthe whole scale appearing dotted with bright blue spots in a zig-zag\r\ndirection. Objects for this illuminator should be especially selected\r\nand mounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.--The Amici Prism.]\r\n\r\nThe Amici Prism, originally designed for oblique illumination, consists\r\nof a flattened triangular glass prism, the two narrower sides of\r\nwhich are slightly convex, while the third or broadest side forms the\r\nreflecting surface. When properly used, it is capable of transmitting\r\na very oblique pencil of light. The prism is either mounted, as in\r\nFig. 147, for slipping into the fitting of the sub-stage, or on an\r\nindependent stand, as arranged for Powell’s microscope, page 85, Fig.\r\n56.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of Employing the Achromatic Condenser to the Greatest Advantage.\r\n\r\n_Its Illumination._--Good daylight is the best for general work. The\r\nmicroscope should be placed near a window with a northern aspect.\r\nDirect sunlight should never be utilised; the best light is that\r\nreflected from a white cloud. A good paraffin lamp is the most\r\nserviceable artificial source of light, and it is quite under control.\r\nAs an illuminant more often brought into requisition in the smoky\r\natmosphere of towns, the paraffin lamp is on the whole the handiest\r\nand the most useful. If gas-light can be brought into use as suggested\r\nfor micro-photography, with the incandescent mantle, it will be found\r\nto be the purest and best form of artificial illumination for the\r\nmicroscope. Among paraffin lamps those constructed by Baker and Swift\r\nare all that can be desired.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSectional view of the Optical Arrangement of the Aplanatic Bull’s-eye\r\nLens, fitted in gymbal on the front of the lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--Baker’s Microscope Lamp.]\r\n\r\nAs the chimneys of these lamps are made of metal, and blackened, no\r\nreflected light disturbs the eye. Care must be taken to have the wick\r\nevenly trimmed; the metal chimney has a glazed front, giving exit to\r\nthe rays of light, the flat of the flame being used with low powers,\r\nand the image of the flame being reflected by a plane mirror to give\r\nequal illumination of the whole field. In working with high powers,\r\nthe lamp is turned with the flame edge-wise, and at the same time the\r\nmirror must be dispensed with. By working, as it is termed, directly\r\non the edge of the flame, the illumination is greatly increased, and a\r\nband of light can be concentrated on any part of the preparation it is\r\ndesired to make a careful study of.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best results, time and care must be given to the\r\nillumination of the object. The lamp and microscope having been placed\r\nin position, a low power is first used and the smallest diaphragm. On\r\nlooking through the microscope it will probably be observed that the\r\nimage of the diaphragm is not in the centre of the field; by moving\r\nthe centring screw of the condenser this may be adjusted. The low\r\npower is then replaced by a high power, the largest diaphragm used,\r\nand the bacteria or diatom brought into focus. The diaphragm must now\r\nbe replaced by one of medium size, and by racking the condenser up and\r\ndown, a point will be arrived at when the image of the edge of the\r\nflame appears as an intensely bright band of light. If this is not\r\nexactly in the centre of the field the centring screw of the condenser\r\nmust again be adjusted. With regard to the use of diaphragms, various\r\nsizes should be tried while focussing with the fine adjustment, at\r\nthe same time using the correction colour; in this way we obtain\r\nthe sharpest possible image. When the condenser has been accurately\r\ncentred, it will still be necessary to focus it for each individual\r\nspecimen, so as to correct for difference in the thickness of slides\r\nand the layers of mounting medium. Correction for different thickness\r\nof cover-glasses must be made by the aid of the collar adjustment\r\nin the following way: a high-power eye-piece is substituted for the\r\nordinary eye-piece, and the faults in the image will thereby be\r\nintensified. By moving the collar completely round, first in one\r\ndirection and then in the other, while carefully observing the effect\r\nof the image, it will be seen to become obviously worse whichever way\r\nthe collar is turned. The collar must then be turned through gradually\r\ndiminishing distances until an intermediate point is reached at which\r\nthe best image results with the high-power eye-piece, and on replacing\r\nthis by the low-power eye-piece the sharpest possible image will be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Effect of the Sub-stage Condenser._--The sub-stage condenser gives\r\nthe most powerful illumination when it has been racked up until it\r\nalmost touches the specimen. It produces a cone of rays of very short\r\nfocus, and the apex of the cone should correspond with the particular\r\nbacterium or group of bacterias under observation. The effect of the\r\ncondenser without a diaphragm is to obliterate what Koch has termed a\r\n_structure picture_. If the component parts of a tissue section were\r\ncolourless and of the same refractive power as the medium in which the\r\nsection is mounted, nothing would be visible under the microscope. As,\r\nhowever, the cells and their nuclei and the tissues do not differ in\r\nthis respect, the rays which pass through them are diffracted, and an\r\nimage of lines and shadows is developed. If in such a tissue there were\r\nminute coloured objects, and if it were possible to mount the tissue\r\nin a medium of exactly the same refractive power, the tissue being\r\nthen invisible, the detection of the coloured objects would be much\r\nfacilitated. This is exactly what is required in dealing with bacteria\r\nwhich has been stained with aniline dyes, and the desired result can be\r\nobtained by the use of the sub-stage condenser.\r\n\r\nIf we use the full aperture of the condenser the greatly converged\r\nrays play on the component parts of the tissue, light enters from\r\nall sides, the shadows disappear, and the structure picture is lost.\r\nIf now a diaphragm is inserted, so that we are practically only\r\ndealing with parallel rays, the structure picture reappears. As\r\nthe diaphragm is gradually increased in size the structure picture\r\ngradually becomes less and less distinct, while the colour picture, the\r\nimage of the stained bacteria, becomes more and more intense. When,\r\ntherefore, bacteria in the living condition and unstained tissues are\r\nexamined, a diaphragm must be used, and when the attention is to be\r\nconcentrated upon the stained bacteria in a section or in a cover-glass\r\npreparation the diaphragm must be removed and the field flooded with\r\nlight--(Crookshank).\r\n\r\nThe wide-angle condenser, it will be understood, consists of a\r\ncombination of lenses, which concentrate all the light entering them\r\nto a small point, and the condenser must be so accurately focussed\r\nthat this brilliant cone of light, when it emerges from the upper lens\r\nof the condenser, falls upon the object from all directions, forming\r\na wide-angle cone of light, at the apex of which the object must be\r\nplaced (see Fig. 149). That is to say, the object is illuminated by a\r\ncone of rays passing through it in all directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.--Front Lens of Condenser.]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, objects which require a fully illuminated field,\r\nwhen the lamp should be turned round and the Herschel lens condenser\r\n(shown in section, Fig. 148) should be used to collect the light and\r\nthrow it upon the mirror. For moderate powers, as a four-tenth or\r\none-fifth, the condenser should be used a little below the focus to\r\ngive an even illumination over the whole field. Moreover, as to the use\r\nof the condenser for defining general objects, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat to show different kinds of structure different apertures in the\r\niris diaphragm are necessary, and that whereas some objects show their\r\nstructure better with a large angle of light cut down in intensity\r\nby the use of blue glass, others show better with a small pencil of\r\ndirect rays. For the resolution of diatoms it is often necessary to\r\nuse oblique light only, and for this purpose diaphragms with central\r\npatches are used, the iris diaphragm being opened to its full extent.\r\nAn annular ring of oblique light emerges from the condenser upon the\r\nobject, and it is in this manner also that dark-ground illumination is\r\nobtained with moderate and low powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.--The Diaphragm.]\r\n\r\nThe early form of diaphragm in use was that shown in Fig. 150.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Shutter Diaphragm.]\r\n\r\nIt consists simply of a circular brass plate with a series of circular\r\nopenings of different sizes, arranged to revolve upon another plate by\r\na central pin or axis, the last being also provided with an opening\r\nas large as the largest in the diaphragm-plate, and corresponding\r\nin situation to the axis of the microscope body. The holes in the\r\ndiaphragm-plate are centred and retained in place by a bent spring in\r\nthe second plate, which rubs against the edge of the diaphragm-plate\r\nand catches in a notch. The blank space shuts off the light from the\r\nmirror when condensed light is about to be used. It is usually made\r\nto fit in under the stage of the microscope. This has been almost\r\nsuperseded by the iris diaphragm, originally designed by Wales, of\r\nAmerica. It was made by this optician for his working students’\r\nmicroscope. An early form of the iris diaphragm is seen in Fig. 151.\r\nBy pressing upon the lever handle at the side the aperture gradually\r\ncloses up, and without for a moment losing sight of the object under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mirror.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which an object is illuminated is, in the words of the\r\nlate Andrew Ross, “second only in importance to the excellence of the\r\nglass through which it is seen.” To ensure good illumination the mirror\r\nshould be in direct co-ordination with the objective and eye-piece;\r\nit must be regarded as a part of the same system, and tending by a\r\ncombined series of acts to a perfect result. Illumination of the object\r\nis recognised as of three kinds or qualities--reflected, transmitted,\r\nand refracted light. For the illumination of transparent objects,\r\ntransmitted light is brought into use; for opaque objects, reflected\r\nlight is needed.\r\n\r\nThe mirror should be about 2-1/2 or 3 inches in diameter, and it must\r\nnot be fixed, but made to slide up and down the stem under the stage,\r\nso that the rays of light emanating from it may be brought to a focus.\r\nThe utility of the mirror is so obvious that it is occasionally passed\r\nover in silence by writers. To myself it appears to be an important\r\naccessory of the microscope, and I shall therefore proceed to combine\r\ntheory with practice in what I have to say with regard to the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Principal Focus of Mirror.]\r\n\r\nThe microscope mirror should be the segment of a true sphere, and its\r\ncentre that of a true curvature. If the mirror has a true circular\r\nboundary, the central point on line A (Fig. 152) of the reflecting\r\nsurface, is the pole of the same. The line A C is known as its\r\nprincipal axis, and any other straight line through C, which meets the\r\nmirror, is its secondary axis. When the incident axis is perfectly\r\nparallel to the principal axis, the reflected rays converge to a point\r\nF, its principal focus. So much for the theory of the mirror. Now we\r\ncome to its practical use.\r\n\r\nSimple as the mirror of the microscope may appear to be, if the curve\r\nof the surface is not perfect, it will yield a secondary reflection or\r\ndouble pencil of rays. The plane mirror will occasionally be found to\r\nemit more than one reflection of the lamp-flame; this we find may be\r\ncorrected by rotating the mirror in its cell. Many years ago I proposed\r\nto meet a difficulty of the kind by arranging a rectangular prism on a\r\nseparate stand, shown in Fig. 153, consisting of a prism A B, mounted\r\nin gimbal C, D, and E, secured to a brass tube G, fitted to the stem,\r\nand thus made to take the place of the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe direct method of employing the mirror, that more generally resorted\r\nto, is by reflecting rays from the concave surface; the plane surface\r\nis preferred when the condenser is used. Whichever is employed, it\r\nshould not be forgotten that the _optic axis_ must be preserved\r\nthroughout, and so brought to the centre of the open tube of the\r\nmicroscope. Another method is to interpose a bull’s-eye lens, and in\r\nthis way supply the mirror with a beam of parallel rays of light. The\r\nplane side of the bull’s-eye lens should be turned towards the lamp,\r\nso that lamp, bull’s-eye, sub-stage condenser, and objective, are\r\nbrought into an exact line, the bull’s-eye being set at right-angles\r\nto the line. A piece of thin white paper held across the bottom of\r\nthe sub-stage will serve to show whether the rays of light are fairly\r\nparallel. The next care is to focus the object on the stage, and then\r\nthe sub-stage condenser on the slide; further correction should be made\r\nby means of the centring screws of the sub-stage, or by moving the\r\nbull’s-eye lens or lamp slightly, thus perfecting the arrangements for\r\nworking with parallel rays of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Rectangular Prism.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessories of the Microscope.\r\n\r\nThe accessories and appliances of the microscope have become so very\r\nnumerous, that any attempt to describe them and explain the uses to\r\nwhich they are put would demand more space than I find myself in a\r\nposition to bestow upon them. I must therefore confine my remarks to\r\nthose accessories in more general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--The Lieberkühn.]\r\n\r\nHaving described the method of employing transmitted light, I have a\r\nfew words to add with regard to the illumination of opaque objects by\r\nreflected light. A very early and efficient form of opaque illumination\r\nis the well-known _Lieberkühn_. This has not been entirely surpassed by\r\nmore recent inventions. The concave speculum termed a Lieberkühn, so\r\nnamed after its celebrated inventor, directly reflects down upon the\r\nobject the light received either from the mirror or bull’s-eye lens.\r\nIt consists of a silver cap, which slides over the objective (Fig.\r\n154), _a_ indicating the lower part of the compound body, and _b_ the\r\nobjective over which slides the Lieberkühn, _c_; the rays of light are\r\ncollected to a focus upon the object at _d_. The object may either\r\nbe mounted on a slip of glass, or held by the stage-forceps, _f_; if\r\nvery small, or transparent, it may be gummed to the dark well, _e_, or\r\nmounted on a Beck’s opaque disc-revolver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Stage Forceps, for holding objects while\r\nunder examination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Beck’s Disc-holder.]\r\n\r\nThis holder will be found useful for the examination of opaque or\r\nother objects that cannot be conveniently held by the stage forceps,\r\nthe specimen being temporarily attached to it by gum or gold size. The\r\nholder is intended to rotate, so that every portion of the object can\r\nbe brought into view. In this way it will be found useful in the study\r\nof insects, foraminifera, &c.\r\n\r\nWith the Lieberkühn, however, the illumination of opaque objects must\r\nbe more or less one-sided, and therefore, the silver side-reflector\r\nhas superseded it for general use (Fig. 157). To ensure a more perfect\r\nillumination of the object, the bull’s-eye lens should also be used.\r\nMr. Sorby devised a reflector to fit over the objective. It consists\r\nof a semi-circular cap; is, in short, a modification of the parabolic\r\nreflector. The light from the mirror can, by slightly varying its\r\ninclination, be brought into use with this reflector.\r\n\r\nThe silver side-reflector is usually made with a ball-and-socket\r\njoint, so that it can be turned in any direction. It is secured to the\r\nstage of the microscope by the pin, which drops into a hole purposely\r\ndrilled to receive it, and facility given for turning up and down, or\r\nin any position. If daylight is used the microscope should be placed\r\nin such a position that the light from a white cloud falls upon the\r\nspeculum, but the light of the lamp is far more manageable for use with\r\nthe reflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--Silver Side-reflector.]\r\n\r\nThe Lieberkühn is only intended to be used with low powers--a 2-inch,\r\n1/2-inch and a 2/3-inch. Such objects as the elytra of the diamond and\r\nother beetles are well suited for examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--Sorby’s Modification of the Parabolic\r\nReflector.]\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting with a parabolic reflector (Fig. 158), Mr. Sorby\r\nsaw the value of examining objects under every kind of illumination.\r\nAs on viewing specimens of iron and steel with this reflector he found\r\nthat, from the great obliquity of the illumination obtained, the more\r\nbrilliantly polished parts of the specimen reflected the light beyond\r\nthe aperture of the objective, and these could not be distinguished\r\nfrom those parts which absorbed light, he thereupon proceeded to place\r\na small flat mirror in front of the objective, and cover half its\r\naperture, and at the same time stop off by means of a semi-cylindrical\r\ntube the light from the parabolic reflector. This arrangement produced\r\nthe reverse appearance of that first employed, and it proved to be a\r\nuseful aid in determining structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bull’s-eye Condensing Lens.\r\n\r\nThis accessory is brought into constant use for the purpose of\r\nconverging rays from a lamp or mirror; or, for reducing the diverging\r\nrays of the lamp to parallelism with the parabolic illuminator, or\r\nsilver side-reflector. The form in use is a plano-convex lens of about\r\nthree or four inches in focal length (Fig. 159). It is usually mounted\r\non a brass stand, so that it may be placed and turned in any direction,\r\nand at any height. When used by daylight, its plane side should be\r\nturned towards the object, and the same position maintained when used\r\nfor converging the rays of light from the lamp; but when used with the\r\nside-reflector the plane side must be towards the lamp. Much attention\r\nhas been paid to this very necessary accessory, the bull’s-eye lens.\r\nA doublet has been brought into use which has increased the value\r\nof the bull’s-eye condenser in bacteriological research, and in\r\nmicro-photography generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Bull’s-eye Lens.]\r\n\r\n“During a recent investigation of the spherical aberration in doublets,\r\nit was believed to be impossible to construct a doublet of the form\r\nknown as ‘Herschel’s doublet’ free from aberration, although these\r\ndoublets figure in many books on optics. In a condenser made by Baker\r\nthe aberration is reduced to a minimum, 27 per cent. less than Sir John\r\nHerschel’s. This doublet, it appears, differs from Herschel’s both in\r\nthe ratio of the radii of the meniscus, and also in the ratio of the\r\nfoci of the two lenses; indeed, the only point of similarity is in the\r\nfirst lens, which is crossed. To test this, project the image of the\r\nflat lamp-flame on a piece of white card with a plano-convex lens (the\r\nfield-lens of the Huyghenian eye-piece), use first the convex side and\r\nthen the plane side towards the card, the lamp being placed about 6\r\nfeet from the lens. Focus the lamp-flame as sharply as possible, and a\r\ncircular halo of misty light will be seen to surround the lamp-flame;\r\nbut when the plane side of the lens is made to face the card this halo\r\nof misty light will be seen to be greatly reduced, and the brightness\r\nof the image of the flame proportionately increased. If the lens, then,\r\nwere strictly aplanatic there should be no misty halo, all the light\r\nbeing concentrated in the image of the lamp-flame, and the image of\r\nmaximum brightness. In short, the diameter of the halo or misty light\r\nis the measure of the spherical aberration. If the condenser referred\r\nto above, having the form of minimum aberration for two planes, be\r\ncompared in the same manner with an ordinary single bull’s-eye of the\r\nsame focus, the diameter of the misty halo will be found reduced to\r\na radius of about 1/5-inch, but, with this new condenser there is a\r\nfurther reduction, so that the radius of the misty halo measures only\r\n1/20-inch. These experiments are instructive, because the brightness,\r\nor the mistiness of the microscopical image is an associated\r\nphenomenon.”[29]\r\n\r\nA sectional view of the optical arrangement of Baker’s aplanatic\r\nbull’s-eye doublet is shown, together with lamp, in Fig. 148.\r\n\r\n_The Microscope Lamp._--The introduction of paraffin into household\r\nuse has somewhat modified our views with regard to the most suitable\r\nartificial source of illumination. Good paraffin burns with a whiter\r\nand purer flame than colza oil, and consequently is less liable to\r\nfatigue the eyes. The first cost of the lamp is trifling; for a\r\nmoderate sum a handy form of lamp can be had, mounted on an adjustable\r\nsliding ring stand, and with a porcelain, metal or paper shade, to\r\nprotect the eyes from scattered rays of light. All opticians supply\r\naccepted forms of lamps.\r\n\r\nTo give the increased effect of whiteness to the light (“white cloud\r\nillumination” as it is termed), take a piece of tissue paper, dip\r\nit into a hot bath of spermaceti, and, when nearly cold, cut out a\r\ncircular piece and secure it over the largest opening in the diaphragm\r\nplate. This will be found to materially moderate and soften the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--Beck’s Complete Lamp.]\r\n\r\n_Beck’s Complete Lamp_ is constructed especially for delicate\r\nmicroscopical work. It has a burner giving a flat flame; this can\r\nbe rotated to enable the edge or the flat of the flame to be used;\r\nlikewise a metal chimney with two apertures, in which 3 × 1 glass\r\nslips slide; either white or coloured glasses may be used. A Herschel\r\naplanatic condenser is carried on a swinging arm, which rotates around\r\nthe lamp flame as a centre, and can be clamped in any position. The\r\nwhole lamp has a raising and lowering motion, with a spring clamp to\r\nhold it in any position. The lamp is so designed that at its lowest\r\nposition the flame is only three inches from the table. Here the\r\nmicroscopist is furnished with a lamp which will accomplish all he may\r\nrequire with regard to illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--Watson’s Microscope Lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Glass Holder for carrying Coloured Glasses.]\r\n\r\nWatson’s lamp (Fig. 161) has a metal chimney, and is somewhat simpler\r\nin structure than those already referred to. For the student, the\r\nsimpler and cheaper form will answer every purpose. A glass holder for\r\ncarrying various tinted slips of coloured glass to act as a screen or\r\nmodifier of the light is much employed, and assists in determining fine\r\nstructures (Fig. 162).\r\n\r\n\r\nNose-pieces and Objective Changers.\r\n\r\nA convenient appendage to the microscope is the rotating nose-piece,\r\ninvented by Mr. Charles Brooke, F.R.S., and intended to carry two or\r\nmore objectives, whereby a saving of time is effected, and the trouble\r\nof repeatedly screwing and unscrewing is avoided. In the application of\r\nthe nose-piece attention should be given to centring. Messrs. Baker’s\r\nobjective changer is intended to facilitate the placing and replacing\r\nthe nose-piece in position. This adaptation consists of a milled head,\r\nacting on three jaws, having a universal screw thread, a decided\r\nimprovement on the screw. Zeiss has adopted a tube-sliding objective\r\nchanger with centring adjustments. Messrs. Watson met the difficulty\r\nof centring by making the nose-piece a part of the body-tube of their\r\nmicroscopes (Fig. 163). This, when adapted to the shorter body of the\r\nstudents’ microscope, fully compensates for want of length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Watson’s Centring Nose-piece of Microscope.]\r\n\r\nTheir triple nose-piece is constructed with much care, and when in use\r\nis found very effective. It is manufactured of that very light metal\r\naluminium, and which minimises the strain produced by the heavier brass\r\nnose-piece.\r\n\r\n_Finders._--The finder affords a necessary and useful means of\r\nregistering the position of any particular object, so that it may\r\nbe readily found again at any subsequent period. In the work of\r\nexamination the finder will save time when making a special research,\r\nextending over a considerable surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Triple Nose-pieces.]\r\n\r\nThat the finder has been of use may be surmised from the number\r\ninvented and figured in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety.” By far the most useful form is that of graduating the plates\r\nof the mechanical stage, dividing a certain portion into 100 parts.\r\nPowell and Lealand have adopted this system in their No. 1 stands,\r\nwhile Baker and Watson have added a graduated scale on silver to\r\n1/100th mm. as a finder, and also a stage micrometer in 1/10th and\r\n1/100th of a millimetre, together with a Maltwood finder for lodging\r\nthe position of any desired portion of a specimen under examination.\r\n\r\nThe _Maltwood_ finder (Fig. 165) can be used with any microscope, and\r\nwithout a mechanical stage. This useful finder continues to occupy a\r\npermanent place among the accessories of the microscope. It consists\r\nof a glass slide, 3 × 1-1/4 inches, on which is photographed a scale\r\noccupying a square inch; this is divided by horizontal and vertical\r\nlines into 2,500 squares, each of which contains two numbers marking\r\nits “latitude,” or place in the vertical series, and its “longitude,”\r\nor place in the horizontal series. The scale is in each instance an\r\nexact distance from the bottom and left-hand end of the glass slide;\r\nand the slide, when in use, should rest upon the ledge of the stage of\r\nthe microscope, and be made to abut against a stop, a simple pin, about\r\nan inch and a half from the centre of the stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Maltwood’s Finder.]\r\n\r\nDr. Pantacsek’s finder appears to have some advantage over Maltwood’s,\r\nbut it cannot be used with the same facility, and therefore will not\r\ndisplace an old favourite. _The Amyot_ finder I have long had in use;\r\nit is efficient and inexpensive--can indeed, if misplaced or lost, be\r\nreplaced by the aid of the square and compasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--Amyot’s Object Finder.]\r\n\r\n_The Okeden_ finder consists of two graduated scales, one _vertical_,\r\nattached to the fixed stage-plate, the other _horizontal_, attached to\r\nan arm carried by the intermediate plate; the first of these scales\r\nenables the worker to “set” the vertically-sliding plate to any\r\ndeterminate position in relation to the fixed plate, while the second\r\ngives the power of setting the horizontally-sliding plate by that of\r\nthe intermediate.\r\n\r\n_Micrometers._--It is of the utmost importance to have a means of\r\nmeasuring with accuracy the objects, or part of objects, under\r\nobservation. The most efficient piece of apparatus for the purpose is\r\nthe micrometer eye-piece, the earlier form of which, Jackson’s, has\r\nbeen described under the heading _Eye-pieces_ (p. 144). In the case of\r\nmicrometers, as in that of most other accessories, every optician has\r\nhis own adaptation and method of employing the same.\r\n\r\nFor the measurement of bacteria, a stage micrometer should be used with\r\na camera lucida. The stage micrometer consists of a slip of thin glass\r\nruled with a scale consisting of tenths and hundredths of a millimetre.\r\nThe image is projected on to a piece of paper placed on the table, and\r\nthe drawing made, and the object to be measured can be readily compared\r\nwith the scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--The Ramsden Micrometer Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\nIn the Ramsden micrometer eye-piece, as previously explained, two fine\r\nwires are stretched across the field of an eye-piece, one of which can\r\nbe moved by a micrometer screw. In the field there is also a scale with\r\nteeth, and the interval between them corresponds to that of the threads\r\nof the screw.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the brass head is usually divided into one hundred\r\nparts, and a screw with one hundred threads to the inch is used. The\r\nbacterium to be measured is brought into a position in which an edge\r\nappears to be in contact with the fixed wire, and the micrometer screw\r\nis turned until the travelling wire appears to be in contact with\r\nthe other edge. The scale in the field and scale on the milled head,\r\ntogether, give the number of complete turns of the screw and the value\r\nof a fraction of a turn in separating the wires.\r\n\r\nIn the micrometer eye-piece constructed by Zeiss, the eye-piece with\r\na glass plate with crossed lines is carried across the field by means\r\nof a micrometer screw. Each division on the edge of a drum corresponds\r\nto ·01 mm. Complete revolutions of the drum are counted by means of a\r\nfigured scale in the visual field.\r\n\r\nIn the micrometer used with Zeiss’s _apochromatic_ objectives and\r\ncompensating eye-pieces the divisions are so computed, that, with a\r\ntube-length of 160 mm., the value of one interval represents, with each\r\nobjective, just as many micra (·0001 mm.) as there are millimetres in\r\nits focal length. A value of tables is therefore not required for these\r\neye-pieces, since the focus of the lenses indicates their micrometer\r\nvalues within 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--The Wollaston Camera Lucida.]\r\n\r\nThe _Camera Lucida_ will prove an extremely useful adjunct to the\r\nmicrometer, and a large number of contrivances have been devised for\r\nits employment. There are those which project the image on to the\r\nsurface of a sheet of paper provided for the drawing, and those which\r\nproject the pencil and paper into the field of the microscope. The\r\nformer method is that usually adopted. To draw an object, with either\r\na Wollaston camera lucida or a neutral tint reflector, such as that\r\nof Beale’s, both of which are made to slide on and take the place of\r\nthe cap of the eye-piece, as shown in Fig. 168, with its flat side\r\nuppermost, the whole instrument must be raised until the edge of the\r\nprism is exactly 10 inches from a piece of paper placed upon the\r\ntable; with the latter the instrument retains its vertical position,\r\nand the image of the object is thrown on the paper placed in front of\r\nthe stand. The light must be so regulated that no more than is really\r\nnecessary is upon the object, whilst a full light should be thrown upon\r\nthe paper. Only one eye is to be used; and if one half of the pupil be\r\ndirected over the edge of the prism, the object will appear upon the\r\npaper, and can be traced on it by a pencil, the point of which will\r\nalso be seen. Should any blueness be visible in the field, the prism is\r\npushed too far on, and should be drawn back till the colour disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Microscope in position for drawing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Beale’s Neutral Tint Reflector.]\r\n\r\nThe position in which the microscope must be placed is shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration (Fig. 169).\r\n\r\nBeale’s neutral tint reflector (Fig. 170) is much in use, and its\r\nadvantages are utility, simplicity, and inexpensiveness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--The Abbe Model Camera Lucida.]\r\n\r\nThe Abbe model of camera lucida has been brought into use because the\r\nprojected image can be better illuminated, and is consequently so much\r\nbrighter. This form is now made in aluminium by Messrs. Watson & Sons.\r\nIn place of the image being traced by projection on paper, the reverse\r\nis the case, both the paper and pencil are projected into the field of\r\nview. The mirror reflects the paper on to the silvered surface of a\r\nprism placed over the eye-lens of the eye-piece of the microscope, and\r\nit is thereby conveyed to the eye. There is a central opening in the\r\nsilvering through which microscopic vision is obtained. It is fitted\r\nin a new manner by means of a cloth-lined adapter, fitting over the\r\noutside of the microscope tube; this saves all trouble in centring and\r\nensures concentricity. Where the instrument has capped eye-pieces, the\r\ncamera lucida must be adapted to the eye-piece, the cap being removed.\r\nThe apparatus can be disconnected from the fitting adapter by means of\r\na sliding pin, and readily replaced, or can be lifted over out of the\r\nway, as shown in the drawing. Being made almost entirely in aluminium\r\nit is very much lighter than other forms of apparatus, and does not\r\ncause vibration. It can be used with the microscope _at any angle_, the\r\nonly necessity being that the paper on which the sketch is made should\r\nbe kept at the same angle as the instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicro-Photography.\r\n\r\nMicro-photography or photo-micrography, as it is indifferently termed,\r\nhas, to a very considerable extent, superseded the use of the camera\r\nlucida for the delineation of images seen under the microscope. I may\r\nclaim to be among the first workers with the microscope (1841) to prove\r\nbeyond a doubt that the camera could be made to render invaluable aid\r\nto the microscopist, whereby a great saving of time might be effected,\r\nand a drawing obtained with greater accuracy than that of the pencil of\r\nthe draughtsman.\r\n\r\nIt was about 1864-5 that Dr. Woodward’s earlier micro-photographs\r\nwere first seen in London. His skill in the manipulation of the\r\nmicroscope had been long known. His first series of photographs of test\r\ndiatoms created, I remember, quite a sensation; they have probably\r\nnever been surpassed. These were taken by sun-light, magnesium, and\r\nelectric-light. I was the recipient of a series taken at a later date\r\n(1870), and which, bound in quarto volume, are almost as perfect in\r\ndefinition as any of a later date taken by oil-immersion objectives.\r\n\r\nThe objectives used by Dr. Woodward, throughout, were a 1/8-inch of\r\nWales’s (new series), and a 1/16-inch immersion, of Powell & Lealand’s,\r\nespecially produced for work with the camera. The magnification varied\r\nfrom 800 to 3,000 diameters, a frustule of _Grammatophora Marina_\r\nmagnified 2,500, and a scale of podura, marked 3,000 in my collection,\r\nare equal in definition to those taken by a high-angle 1/12-inch\r\noil-immersion. Pathological specimens taken with lower powers are\r\nequally instructive, a section of epithelial cancer showing both nuclei\r\nand cells with distinctness.\r\n\r\nDr. Maddox in 1864 was also experimentally engaged in the improvement\r\nof the processes of photography for the purpose of promoting the work\r\nof microscopists. His labours were attended with great success. To\r\nhim we are indebted for the gelatine dry-plate process, which gave\r\na remarkable impetus to photography in general. Dr. Maddox has, for\r\na period extending over forty years, diligently and successfully\r\ncultivated and promoted micro-photography. Among other workers to whom\r\nwe are indebted for improvements in micro-photography I may mention\r\nWenham, Draper, Shadbolt, Highley, Koch, Sternberg, Pringle, Leitz, and\r\nPfeiffer.\r\n\r\nDr. Koch justly claims the credit of having extended the application\r\nof micro-photography to the delineation of bacteria. A series of\r\ninstructive micro-photographs were published by him in 1877.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the camera has become more manifest as the work\r\nof the bacteriologist has progressed. Koch strongly advocated\r\nmicro-photography on the ground that illustrations, especially of\r\nbacteria, should be as true to nature as possible. Dr. Edgar Crookshank\r\nholds the same opinion, and in support of his views we have numerous\r\nillustrations of the bacteria given in his valuable “Text-book of\r\nBacteriology.” But he does not disguise the truth that there are\r\ndifficulties to be encountered, the first of which is owing to the\r\nfact that the smallest and most interesting bacteria can only be made\r\nvisible in animal tissues by _staining_. This drawback has been very\r\nnearly overcome by the use of eosin-collodion. With this medium, and\r\nby shutting off portions of the spectrum by coloured glasses, Koch\r\nsucceeded in obtaining photographs of bacteria, which were stained\r\nwith blue and red aniline dyes. This method, however, introduced a\r\ndisturbing element of another kind. Owing to the longer exposure\r\nrequired, the results were wanting in definition, attributable, it was\r\nthought, to vibrations of the apparatus produced by passing traffic, or\r\nby assistants moving about over the floor of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nKoch nevertheless showed, at the great meeting of the International\r\nMedical Association in London, 1881, a series of micro-photographs\r\nof bacteria and tissue sections, which were the admiration of all\r\nwho saw them. To meet a difficulty occasioned by the aniline dyes,\r\nKoch recommended that the preparations should be stained brown;\r\nother experimenters found that preparations stained either yellow or\r\nyellowish-brown gave good photographic representations; but it is by\r\nno means an easy matter to find a good differential stain of bacteria\r\nin the tissues, as even Bismarck brown is not entirely successful.\r\nOther bacteriologists have encountered similar difficulties at the\r\noutset. Hauser succeeded in showing the value of micro-photography\r\nin the production of pictures of _impression_ preparations and\r\ncolonies of bacteria in nutrient-gelatine. But to give the general\r\neffect, as well as faithfully reproduce the minute details in these\r\npreparations of bacteria by the aid of the pencil, would in most\r\ncases create insurmountable difficulties, except in the hand of the\r\nmost accomplished draughtsman. Hauser employed Gerlach’s apparatus,\r\nand Schleusser’s dry-plates, and obtained his illumination by means\r\nof a small incandescent lamp, which gave a strong white light. The\r\npreparations so photographed were for the most part stained brown, and\r\nmounted in the ordinary way in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Van Ermengen succeeded in photographing preparations of\r\ncomma-bacilli stained with fuchsine and methyl violet. These pictures\r\nafforded the first practical illustration of the value of iso-chromatic\r\nplates in micro-photography, and their introduction marks a distinct\r\nera in the progress of micro-photography. The iso-chromatic, or more\r\nproperly the ortho-chromatic, dry-plate process was introduced because\r\nin photography blue or violet comes out almost or quite white, while\r\nother colours, yellow and red, are represented by a sombre shade or\r\neven by black. This is due to the want of equality of strength between\r\nthe luminous and the actinic or chemical rays of light. In other\r\nwords, the violet and blue rays are more chemically active than any\r\nother portion of the spectrum. It was found, then, that if plates\r\nwere coloured yellow with turmeric, the blue and violet rays were\r\nintercepted, and their actinism proportionately reduced.\r\n\r\n“In 1881, the so-called iso-chromatic plates were introduced. The\r\nemulsion of bromide of silver and gelatine was stained with eosin, and\r\nit was claimed that colours could be represented with their relative\r\nintensity; chlorophyll and other stains have also been tried, and\r\nby such methods the ordinary gelatine dry-plates can be so treated\r\nthat they will reproduce various colours, according to their relative\r\nlight intensity, and thus be rendered _iso_-, or what is now known as\r\northo-chromatic.”\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus and Material.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus and Material_ used in micro-photography have, from time to\r\ntime, been greatly varied by different workers, some preferring to use\r\nthe microscope in the vertical position with the camera superimposed\r\nor fitted on the eye-piece of the microscope tube; others, again,\r\nprefer that both the microscope and the camera should be arrayed\r\nhorizontally. In another form the ordinary microscope is dispensed with\r\nand the objective stage and mirror are adapted to the front of the\r\ncamera, together with a suitable arrangement for holding the object.\r\nLastly, the camera is lain aside, and an operating-room rendered\r\nimpervious to light, takes its place, and the image is projected and\r\nfocussed upon a ground glass screen held in its place by a separate\r\nsupport. This method has been made practical since the introduction\r\ninto microscopy by Zeiss of the _projection_ eye-piece. It is well\r\nknown that micro-photographs can be produced by employing these\r\nprojection eye-pieces, as well as for screen illustrations in the\r\nlecture-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Swift’s Horizontal Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the position of the microscope and camera, the\r\nhorizontal affords greater stability than the vertical, and is on this\r\naccount to be preferred. The simplest apparatus consists of a camera\r\nfixed upon a base board, four or five feet in length, upon which\r\nthe microscope can be clamped, and which also carries the lamp and\r\nbull’s-eye lens (Fig. 172). This arrangement I have found economical\r\nand useful. No more elaborate arrangement is actually necessary.\r\nSunlight is no doubt the best, but a good paraffin lamp is a handy and\r\navailable illuminant.\r\n\r\nWith the former, and rapid plates, a short exposure of three or four\r\nseconds, even when high powers are used, is found sufficient; whereas,\r\nwith the paraffin lamp it will vary from three to ten minutes.\r\n\r\nWalmsley gives the following table for exposures with the lamp:--\r\n\r\n  1-1/2-inch  objective     3 to 45 seconds.\r\n  2/3-inch        \"         7 to 90    \"\r\n  4/10-inch       \"       1/2 to  3 minutes.\r\n  1/5-inch        \"         2 to  7    \"\r\n  1/10-inch       \"         4 to 10    \"\r\n\r\nFor micro-photography the following practical rules must be observed.\r\nThe sub-stage condenser may be dispensed with when low powers are used,\r\nas well as the mirror, and the lamp so placed that the image of the\r\nflat of the flame appears accurately adjusted in the centre of the\r\nfield of the microscope. The bull’s-eye lens is so interposed, that\r\nthe image of the flame disappears, and the whole field becomes equally\r\nilluminated with high powers; the sub-stage achromatic condenser must\r\nbe used, and a greater intensity of illumination is obtained by placing\r\nthe lamp-flame edgeways. It is advisable to begin the practice of\r\nmicro-photography with low powers, and a trial experiment should be\r\nmade with some well-known object as the blow-fly’s tongue.\r\n\r\nDr. Crookshank is of opinion that, in the case of micro-organisms\r\nwhen their biological characters are studied under low powers of the\r\nmicroscope, photographs are preferable, because they give a more\r\nfaithful representation of the object. A micro-organism, even under\r\nthe highest powers of the microscope, is so minute an object, that to\r\nrepresent it in a drawing requires a very delicate touch, and it is\r\nonly too easy to make a _picture_ which gives an erroneous impression\r\nto those who have not seen the original. Photography enables the\r\nscientific worker to record rapid changes, and it is quite possible as\r\nthe art advances we may find the film more sensitive than the human\r\nretina, and that it will bring out details in bacteria which would be\r\notherwise unrecognised. The result, therefore, of experience is that in\r\nresearch laboratories it will come into more general use as a faithful\r\nand graphic method. I cannot better bring these observations to a close\r\nthan by giving a quotation from Dr. Piersoll’s practical method of\r\nobtaining micro-photographs.\r\n\r\nThe three essential conditions to ensure success in micro-photography\r\nare:--(1) Satisfactory apparatus; (2) good illumination; (3) suitable\r\npreparations. With high amplifications (1,000 diameters and over),\r\nthe conditions are greatly changed by the approach to the limit both\r\nof the shortness of the focus of the objective and of the length of\r\nthe camera which can be advantageously used; for the first experience\r\nleads to the adoption of the 1/12-inch, for the second four feet is\r\nthe limit, since a given high amplification, say 2,000 diameters,\r\ncan be more satisfactorily and more conveniently obtained with a\r\nsuperior 1/12-inch connection with suitable optical means to increase\r\nthe initial magnifying power of the objective, than with an unaided\r\n1/25-inch lens, and the plate removed to a greater distance. Until\r\nquite recently the various amplifiers offered the best means of\r\nincreasing the power of an objective, but the introduction of the\r\n_projection-oculars_ of Zeiss is an accessory piece of apparatus,\r\nfar superior to any older device. These projection-oculars resemble\r\nordinary microscopical oculars or eye-pieces only in general form\r\nand name, being optically a projection-objective in connection with\r\na collecting lens. The new oil-immersion apochromatic lenses, in\r\ncombination with these projection-oculars, form undoubtedly the more\r\nefficient equipment for high-power work; it is as true for high-power\r\nphotography as for microscopical observation in general, that the best\r\nresults are obtained with fine and necessarily expensive, optical\r\nappliances. If for the satisfactory study of the intimate structure of\r\na cell, or of a micro-organism, the most improved immersion lenses are\r\nnecessary, it is to be expected that, for the successful photography of\r\nthe same, tools at least as good are needed. Sunlight certainly affords\r\nthe most satisfactory illumination whereby good micro-photographs can\r\nbe obtained, as well as for recording microscopical images. That by\r\ngood lamp-light fair impressions of objects under extreme magnification\r\ncan be secured is encouraging, but the negatives produced by such\r\nillumination seldom, if ever, possess the characteristics of a really\r\ngood sunlight negative, where the sharpest details are combined with an\r\nexquisite softness and harmony of half-tones.\r\n\r\nIf the mirror of the microscope be of good size, it will only be\r\nnecessary to make an arm on which to support the removed mirror outside\r\nsome southerly exposed window, since it is desirable to have a greater\r\ndistance between the mirror and the stage than would be possible were\r\nthe mirror attached in its usual place. Where the microscope mirror\r\nis too small to be satisfactorily used, a rectangular wood-framed\r\nlooking-glass is readily mounted, with the aid of a few strips of wood,\r\nso as to turn about both axes.\r\n\r\nThe rays from the plane side of the mirror should pass through a\r\ncondensing lens (of 8-10-inch focus, if possible), so placed that\r\nthey are brought to a focus before reaching the plane of the object.\r\nThe exact position of the condensing lens is a matter of experience;\r\nusually, however, the most favourable illumination is obtained at that\r\npoint where the field is brilliantly and _uniformly_ illuminated,\r\njust before the rays form the image source of light; the nearer the\r\nfocus the less disturbance from diffraction rings. Ordinary objectives\r\nwill require the employment of monochromatic light--produced either\r\nby a deep blue solution of ammonia-sulphate of copper, or by the\r\ngreen glass screen--since the optical and actinic foci do not usually\r\nperfectly coincide. Powers up to the 3/4-inch will require no further\r\ncondenser; with the 1/4 or 1/6-inch objectives, the low power (1 or\r\n3/4-inch) serves with advantage as an achromatic condenser, when\r\nattached to the sub-stage. The Abbe condenser, although so important\r\nfor fine microscopical investigation, is not adapted to photography\r\nunless a very wide cone of light is desired, which, for the majority\r\nof preparations, is some advantage; a low-power objective, used as a\r\ncondenser, is found to be more satisfactory than the Abbe with a small\r\ndiaphragm.[30]\r\n\r\nThe greatest delicacy in manipulation is necessary, as in working with\r\na 1/12-inch objective a turn too much of the fine adjustment will cause\r\nthe image to vanish. With fine preparations of bacteria it is not\r\neasy to trace the image, and hence the advantage of commencing with\r\na well-marked object, as that of the fly’s tongue. The development\r\nand fixation of the image must be proceeded with as in the ordinary\r\nphotographic process. In the text-books of photography full accounts\r\nof failures will be found, their causes and prevention. Numerous\r\npapers and suggestions for micro-photographic work will also be found\r\nscattered throughout the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society.”\r\n\r\nThe _Projection Eye-piece_ has become an essential part of\r\nmicro-photography, and it is so arranged that it may be employed with\r\nadvantage with objectives of either the apochromatic or ordinary series\r\nfor photographic purposes, projecting an exquisitely sharp image of the\r\nobject on the plate. A diaphragm between the lenses limits the field,\r\nand a sharp image of it should appear on the screen when the eye-piece\r\nis adjusted. The adjustment may be effected by revolving the eye-piece\r\ncap in a spiral slot, so that the eye or top lens is either brought\r\ncloser or removed farther away from the diaphragm, as may be required,\r\nand divisions and a reader are usually provided for registering\r\npositions. Such eye-pieces are made to fit any size microscope body.\r\n\r\n  Initial magnifying powers:--\r\n       English length of tube   10-in.   3 and 6.\r\n       Continental \"      \"      6-in.   2 and 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--Baker’s Pringle Vertical Micro-photographic\r\nApparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe microscope and camera (Fig. 173) are here seen to be part of\r\nthe same instrument. The bellows of the camera have an extension\r\nvarying from 6 in. to 30 in. The board on which the microscope and\r\nlimelight jet are fixed is made to turn out of the line of the camera\r\nto facilitate adjusting the instrument and radiant, either limelight,\r\nelectric light or paraffin lamp; when this is done the board carrying\r\nthe same is turned back to a stop which brings the microscope into a\r\ncentral position with the focussing screen. An adjustment is supplied\r\nat the side of the camera, geared to the slow movement, for finely\r\nfocussing the object upon the screen. A light-excluding connection is\r\nfitted to the front of the camera and microscope; immediately behind\r\nthis, in the bellows, is an exposing shutter which is manipulated\r\nby means of a small milled head. Two focussing screens are usually\r\nsupplied, one grey, and one patent plate, together with a double dark\r\nslide.\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Pringle’s vertical micro-photographic apparatus is an\r\nexcellent form; it consists of a heavy base and brass support, carrying\r\na quarter-plate camera, grey and plain glass focussing screen, double\r\ndark back, camera extending to 24 inches, and turning aside as shown in\r\nFig 173. It is light-tight in all its connections.\r\n\r\nTo secure uniform results in micro-photography, only thin preparations,\r\nwhich lie as nearly as possible in one plane, can be relied upon for\r\ngood and perfect negatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--Ross’s Arc Lamp.]\r\n\r\nAn electric arc lamp specially designed for micro-photographic work,\r\nwherever the electric current is available, is that known as “the\r\nRoss-Hepworth projection arc lamp.” The advantage gained by this\r\nform of lamp is not only on account of the ease with which it may be\r\nemployed, but also on account of its superior power and quality. It is\r\nof primary importance that the lamp employed to convert the electricity\r\ninto light should be of a good and reliable pattern. It is not\r\nessential that it should be automatic in its working--many experienced\r\nmicro-photographers preferring a simple hand-feed lamp to the one of a\r\nmore complicated kind, being so much less difficult to keep in order. A\r\ngood hand-feed microscope-lamp has the advantage of greater simplicity\r\nand portability.\r\n\r\nThe argand gas-light arranged for me many years ago for\r\nmicro-photography may be employed with advantage. It is clean, and\r\nalways ready for use when brought down to the table attached by a piece\r\nof india-rubber tubing. The incandescent form of burner enhances its\r\nvalue, since the light is thereby rendered whiter. The arrangement is\r\nshown in the diagrammatic drawing, Fig. 175.\r\n\r\nOver the argand burner B, is a pale-blue glass chimney, resting on a\r\nwire gauze, stage A; this secures a uniform current of air. The colour\r\nof the flame may be still more influenced by a disc of neutral tint,\r\nor other coloured glass, inserted into the circular opening at E, in a\r\nhalf-cylinder of metal, G, used to cut off all extraneous light; can\r\nbe rotated on the stage by the ivory nob at H, a metallic reflector I,\r\nattached to the standard rod, on being brought parallel to F serves to\r\nconcentrate the light and send it on to the bull’s-eye, and through it\r\nto the mirror, or directly to the photo-microscopic camera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Table Incandescent Gas-lamp.]\r\n\r\nBy removing the shield G, and bringing the shade M over the burner, it\r\nis at once converted into a useful microscopical lamp, for all ordinary\r\npurposes. The screw R clamps the lamp-flame at any height, while the\r\nsupport N carries a water-bath O, or a plate P, both of which will be\r\nfound useful in preparing and mounting objects.\r\n\r\nA special incandescent gas-lamp is made by Messrs. R. & J. Beck.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolarisation of Light.\r\n\r\nCommon light moves in two planes at right angles to each other, while\r\npolarised light moves in one plane only. Common light may be turned\r\ninto polarised light either by transmission or reflection; in the\r\nfirst instance, one of the planes of common light is got rid of by\r\nreflection; in the other, by absorption. Huyghens was one of the first\r\nphysicists to notice that a ray of light has not the same properties in\r\nevery part of its circumference, and he compared it to a magnet or a\r\ncollection of magnets; and supposed that the minute particles of which\r\nit was said to be composed had different poles, which, when acted on in\r\ncertain ways, arranged themselves in particular positions; and thence\r\nthe term _polarisation_, a term having neither reference to cause nor\r\neffect. It is to Malus, however, who, in 1808, discovered polarisation\r\nby reflection, that we are indebted for the series of splendid\r\nphenomena which have since that period been developed; phenomena of\r\nsuch surpassing beauty as to exceed most ordinary objects presented to\r\nthe eye under the microscope.\r\n\r\nCertainly no more misleading name could well have been found to\r\ndescribe the causation, in one particular direction, of small\r\ndisplacements in the medium, through which the light waves are made to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThe effect of “polarising” light is simply to alter the directions of\r\nthe vibrations of light, and allow of certain waves to pass which are\r\nvibrating in one direction only, vertical, horizontal, or oblique,\r\nas the case may be. The most efficient agent discovered for the\r\npolarisation of light is that of Iceland spar, cut and mounted as a\r\n“Nicol” prism.\r\n\r\nBy cutting crystals of Iceland spar into two parts, at a particular\r\nangle, and cementing them together again in the reverse way, Nicol\r\nsucceeded in showing that one of the two polarising pencils could be\r\ntotally deflected to one side, while the other is directly transmitted\r\nthrough the Nicol prism, and thereby the beam of light becomes at once\r\n“polarised” in one plane only. No apparent difference can be seen in\r\nthe prism on holding it up to the light, except it be in a very slight\r\nloss of brightness; but if another similarly heated crystal be held\r\nbefore, and made to revolve around, a quarter of the circle just where\r\nthe two cross each other, total darkness results. This phenomenon\r\nalternately recurs at every quadrature of the circle. A pair of Nicol\r\nprisms, when appropriately mounted, constitute “a polarising apparatus”\r\nfor the microscope, one being fitted into the sub-stage, and the other\r\neither immediately above the objective or eye-piece, where it can be\r\neasily rotated, the object to be examined being placed on the stage of\r\nthe microscope, that is, between the polarising and analysing prisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLARISCOPE OBJECTS.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII.]\r\n\r\nThe significance of polarised light centres in the fact that it affords\r\na wider insight into the structure of crystals, minerals, and a number\r\nof other substances, and which could not otherwise be obtained without\r\nits aid. Its usefulness is multifold, as even glass itself, when\r\nnot properly annealed, exhibits points of fracture, by a display of\r\nNewton’s rings. The knowledge thus acquired is turned to account by\r\nglass manufacturers.\r\n\r\n_Double refraction._--When an incident ray of light is refracted into\r\na crystal of any other than the cubic system, or into compressed or\r\n_unannealed glass_, it gives rise to two refracted rays which take\r\ndifferent paths; this phenomenon is termed _double refraction_.\r\nAttention was called to this in 1670, by Bartolin, who first observed\r\nit in Iceland spar; and the laws for this substance were accurately\r\ndetermined by Huyghens.\r\n\r\nIceland spar or calc spar is a form of crystallized carbonate of\r\nlime. It is composed of fifty-six parts of lime and forty-four parts\r\nof carbonic acid, and is usually found in rhombohedral forms of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nTo observe the phenomenon of double refraction, a rhomb of Iceland\r\nspar may be laid on a page of a printed book, when all the letters\r\nseen through it will appear double; the depth of the blackness of the\r\nletters is seen to be considerably less than that of the originals,\r\nexcept where the two images overlap.\r\n\r\nIn order to state the laws of the phenomena with precision, it is\r\nnecessary to attend to the crystalline form of Iceland spar, which has\r\nequal obtuse angles. If a line be drawn through one of these corners,\r\nmaking equal angles with the three edges which meet there, it, or\r\nany line parallel to it, is called the _axis_ of the crystal; the\r\naxis being, properly speaking, not a definite _line_ but a definite\r\n_direction_.\r\n\r\nThe angles of the crystals are the same in all specimens. If the\r\ncrystal is of such proportions that these three edges spoken of are\r\nequal, as in the smaller crystal (Fig. 176), the axis is the direction\r\nof one of its diagonals, as represented.\r\n\r\nAny plane containing (or parallel to) the axis is called the _principal\r\nplane_ of the crystal.\r\n\r\nIn the next diagram, Fig. 177, the line appears double, as _a b_ and\r\n_c d_, or the dot, as _e_ and _f_. Or allow a ray of light, _g h_, to\r\nfall thus on the crystal, it will in its passage through be separated\r\ninto two rays, _h f_, _h e_; and on coming to the opposite surface of\r\nthe crystal, will pass out at _e f_ in the direction of _i k_, parallel\r\nto _g h_. The plane _l m n o_ is designated the principal section of\r\nthe crystal, and the line drawn from the solid angle _l_ to the angle\r\n_o_ is where the axis of the crystal will be found; this is its optic\r\naxis. Now when a ray of light passes along this axis, it is undivided,\r\nand there is only one image; but in all other directions there are two\r\nimages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Axis of Crystals of Iceland Spar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--A Rhomb showing the passage of Rays of Light.]\r\n\r\nMr. Nicol, of Edinburgh first succeeded in making a rhomb of Iceland\r\nspar into a _single-image prism_. His method of splitting up the\r\ncrystal into two equal parts was as follows:--\r\n\r\nA rhomb of Iceland spar of one-fourth of an inch in length, and about\r\nfour-eighths of an inch in breadth and thickness, is divided into two\r\nequal portions in a plane, passing through the acute lateral angle, and\r\nnearly touching the obtuse side angle. The sectional plane of each of\r\nthese halves must be carefully polished, and the two portions cemented\r\nfirmly together with Canada balsam, so as to form a rhomb similar to\r\nthat before division; by this management the ordinary and extraordinary\r\nrays are so separated that only one is transmitted: the cause of this\r\ngreat divergence of the rays is considered to be owing to the action\r\nof the Canada balsam, the refractive index of which (1·549) is that\r\nbetween the ordinary (1·6543) and the extraordinary (1·4833) refraction\r\nof calcareous spar, and which will change the direction of both rays\r\nin an opposite manner before they enter the posterior half of the\r\ncombination. The direction of rays passing through such a prism is\r\nindicated by the arrow, Fig. 178.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.]\r\n\r\nPolarised light cannot be distinguished from common light, as\r\nalready said, by the naked eye; and for all experimental purposes in\r\npolarisation, two pieces of apparatus must be employed, one to produce\r\npolarisation, and the other to show or an analyse it. The former is\r\ncalled the _polariser_, the latter the _analyser_; and every apparatus\r\nthat serves for one of these purposes will also serve for the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--Polariser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179_a_.--Analyser.]\r\n\r\nPolarising Apparatus for Students’ Microscope.\r\n\r\nIn all cases there are two positions, differing by 180°, which give\r\na minimum of light, and the two positions intermediate between these\r\ngive a maximum of light. The extent of the changes thus observed is a\r\nmeasure of the completeness of the polarisation of light.\r\n\r\nThe two prisms mounted as shown in Figs. 179 and 179_a_ constitute the\r\napparatus adapted to the microscope. The polariser slips into place\r\nbelow the stage, and the analyser, with the prism fixed in a tube, is\r\nscrewed in above the objective.\r\n\r\nThe definition is considered by some experimenters as somewhat better\r\nif the analyser be used above the eye-piece, and is certainly more\r\neasily rotated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Prism mounted as an Eye-piece.]\r\n\r\n_Method of employing the Polarising Prism_ (Fig. 179).--After having\r\nadapted it to slide into a groove on the under-surface of the stage,\r\nwhere it is secured and kept in place by the small milled-head screw,\r\nthe other prism (Fig. 179_a_) is screwed on above the object-glass,\r\nand thus passes directly into the body of the microscope. The light\r\nfrom the mirror having been reflected through them the axes of the\r\ntwo prisms must be made to coincide; this is done by regulating the\r\nmilled-head screw until, by revolving the _polarising_ prism, the field\r\nof view is entirely darkened twice during its revolution. If very\r\nminute salts or crystals are submitted for examination then it will be\r\nfound preferable to place the analyser above the eye-piece, as in Fig.\r\n180. Thus the _polariscope_ is seen to consist of two parts; one for\r\n_polarising_, the other for _analysing_ or testing the light. There is\r\nno essential difference between the two parts, except what convenience\r\nor economy may lead us to adopt; and either part, therefore, may be\r\nused as polariser or analyser; but whichever is used as the polariser,\r\nthe other becomes the analyser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--More Modern Polariser and Analyser.]\r\n\r\nOpticians have their own methods of adapting the polariser and analyser\r\nto their several microscopes. Watson’s special form of apparatus is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 181, the polariser being adapted to the sub-stage,\r\nand the analyser to screw into the objective.\r\n\r\n_Tourmaline._--A semi-transparent mineral, of a neutral or bluish tint,\r\ncalled tourmaline, when cut into thin slices (about 1/20-inch thick)\r\nwith their faces parallel to their axes exhibit the same phenomena as\r\nthe Nicol prism. The only objection to which is that the transmitted\r\npolarised beam is more or less coloured. The tourmaline to be preferred\r\nstops the most light when its axis is at right-angles to that of the\r\npolariser, and yet admits the most when in the same plane. Make choice\r\nof a tourmaline as perfect as possible; size is of less importance when\r\nintended for use with the microscope.\r\n\r\nTransmission of rays through tourmaline is only one of several ways\r\nin which light can be polarised. When a beam of light is reflected\r\nfrom a polished surface of glass, wood, ivory, leather, or any other\r\nnon-metallic substance, at an angle of 50° to 60° with the normal, it\r\nis more or less polarised, and in like manner a reflector composed of\r\nany of these substances may be employed as an analyser. In so using it,\r\nit should be rotated about an axis parallel to the incident rays which\r\nare to be tested, and the observation consists in noting whether this\r\nrotation produces changes in the amount of reflected light.\r\n\r\nFor every reflected substance there is a particular angle of incidence,\r\nwhich gives a maximum of polarisation in reflected light. It is called\r\nthe _polarising angle_ for the substance, and its tangent is always\r\nequal to the index of refraction of the substance; or, what amounts to\r\nthe same thing, it is that particular angle of incidence which is the\r\ncomplement of the angle of refraction, so that the refracted rays are\r\nat right angles. This important law was discovered experimentally by\r\nSir David Brewster.\r\n\r\nTourmaline, like Iceland spar, is a negative uniaxial crystal; and\r\nits use as a polariser depends on the property which it possesses of\r\nabsorbing the ordinary much more rapidly than the extraordinary ray, so\r\nthat a thickness which is tolerably transparent to the latter is almost\r\ncompletely opaque to the former. Its pale cobalt blue colour enhances\r\nthe beauty of certain crystal and mineral substances, but like Iceland\r\nspar, the paler and more perfect crystals are becoming scarce.\r\n\r\n_Selenite_ is another mineral of value in polarisation experiments. It\r\nis a native crystalline hydrated sulphate of lime. A beautiful fibrous\r\nvariety called _satin-gypsum_ is found in Derbyshire. The form of the\r\ncrystal most frequently met with is that of an oblique rectangular\r\nprism, with ten rhomboidal faces, two of which are much larger than the\r\nrest. It is usually split up into thin laminæ parallel to their lateral\r\nfaces; each film should have a thickness of from one-twentieth to\r\none-sixtieth of an inch. In the two rectangular directions these films\r\nallow perpendicular rays of polarised light to traverse them unchanged,\r\ntermed their _neutral axes_. In two other directions, however, which\r\nform respectively angles of 45° with the neutral axes, these films\r\nhave the property of double refraction, a direction known as the\r\n_depolarising axis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--Darker’s Selenite Films and Stage.]\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the film of selenite determines the particular tint.\r\nIf, therefore, we use a film of irregular thickness, different colours\r\nare presented by the different thicknesses. These facts admit of very\r\ncurious and beautiful illustration, when used under the object placed\r\non the stage of the microscope. The films employed should be mounted\r\nbetween two glasses for protection. Some persons employ a large film,\r\nmounted in this way between the plates of glass, with a raised edge,\r\nto act as a stage for supporting the object, it is then called the\r\n“selenite stage.” The best film for the microscope is that which\r\ngives blue, and its complementary colour yellow. The late Mr. Darker\r\nconstructed a selenite stage for the purpose (Fig. 182). With this a\r\nmixture of colours will be brought about, by superimposing three films,\r\none on the other. By slight variations in their positions, produced\r\nby means of an endless-screw motion, all the colours of the spectrum\r\ncan be shown. When objects are thus exhibited, it should be borne in\r\nmind that all negative tints, as they are termed, are diminished, and\r\nall positive tints increased; the effect of which is to mask the true\r\ncharacter of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nFor a certain thickness of selenite the ellipse will become a circle,\r\nand we have thus what is called _circularly-polarised_ light, which is\r\ncharacterised by the property that rotation of the analyser produces\r\nno change of intensity. Circularly-polarised light is not, however,\r\nidentical with ordinary light; for the interposition of an additional\r\nthickness of selenite converts it into elliptically (or in a particular\r\ncase into plane) polarised light.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, for the exhibition of colour in our experiments, that\r\nthe plate of selenite should be very thin, otherwise the retardation\r\nof one component vibration as compared with the other will be greater\r\nby several complete periods for violet than for red, so that the\r\nellipses will be identical for several different colours, and the total\r\nnon-suppressed light will be sensibly white in all positions of the\r\nanalyser.\r\n\r\nTwo thick plates may, however, be so combined as to produce the effect\r\nof one thin plate. For example, two selenite plates of nearly equal\r\nthickness may be laid one upon the other, so that the direction of\r\ngreatest elasticity in the one shall be parallel to that of least\r\nelasticity in the other. The resultant effect in this case will be that\r\ndue to the difference of their thicknesses. Two plates so laid are said\r\nto be _crossed_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--_Red_ is represented by perpendicular lines;\r\n_Green_ by oblique.]\r\n\r\nThe following experiments will well serve to illustrate some of the\r\nmore striking phenomena of double refraction, and will also be a useful\r\nintroduction to its practical application. Take a plate of brass (Fig.\r\n183) three inches by one, perforated with a series of holes from about\r\none-sixteenth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter; the size of the\r\nsmallest should be in accordance with the power of the objective, and\r\nthe separating power of the double refraction.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_ 1.--Place the brass plate so that the smallest hole shall\r\nbe in the centre of the stage of the microscope; employ a low power\r\n(1-1/2 or 2 inches) objective, and adjust the focus as for the ordinary\r\nmicroscopic object; place the double image prism over the eye-piece,\r\nand two distinct images will be seen; by revolving the prism, the\r\nimages will describe a circle, the circumference of which will cut the\r\ncentre of the field of view; one of which is the ordinary, the other\r\nthe extraordinary ray. By moving the slide from left to right the\r\nlarger orifices will appear in the field, the images seen will not be\r\ncompletely separated, but will overlap, as represented in the figure.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_ 2.--Insert the Nicol’s prism into its place under the\r\nstage, still retaining the double image prism over the eye-piece;\r\nthen, by examining the object, there will appear in some positions two\r\nimages, in others only one image; it will be seen, that at 90° this ray\r\nwill be cut off, and that which was first observed will become visible;\r\nat 180°, or one-half the circle, an alternate change will take place;\r\nat 270°, another change; and at 360°, the completion of the circle, the\r\nfirst image will reappear.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to make the next experiment, the position of the\r\nNicol’s prism should be adjusted, and its angles brought parallel with\r\nthe square of the stage. The true relative position of the selenite\r\nshould also be determined by noticing the natural flaws in the film,\r\nwhich should run parallel with each other, and be adjusted at an angle\r\nof about 46° with the square bars of the stage.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_ 3.--If we now take the plate of selenite thus prepared,\r\nand place it under the piece of brass on the stage, we shall see,\r\ninstead of the alternate black and white images, two coloured images\r\ncomposed of the constituents of white light, which will alternately\r\nchange by revolving the eye-piece at every quarter of the circle; then,\r\nby passing along the brass, the images will overlap; and at the point\r\nat which they do so, white light will be produced. If, by accident, the\r\nprism be placed at an angle of 45° from the square part of the stage,\r\nno particular colour will be perceived, and it will then illustrate the\r\nphenomena of the neutral axis of the selenite, because when placed in\r\nthe relative position no depolarisation takes place. The phenomena of\r\npolarised light may be further illustrated by the addition of a second\r\ndouble image prism, and a film of selenite adapted between the two.\r\nThe systems of coloured rings in crystals cut perpendicularly to the\r\nprincipal axis of the crystal are best seen by employing the lowest\r\nobject-glass.\r\n\r\n_Biaxial Crystals._--To show perfectly the beautiful series of _rings\r\nand brushes_ which biaxial crystals exhibit, it becomes necessary\r\nto convert the microscope, for the time being, into (so to speak) a\r\nwide-angled telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Huyghenian Eye-piece.\r\n\r\nInner draw-tube.\r\n\r\nObjective in draw-tube.\r\n\r\nAnalysing Prism.\r\n\r\nObjective.\r\n\r\nSpecimen under Examination.\r\n\r\nSub-stage Condenser.\r\n\r\nPolarising Prism, fixed in sub-stage below.\r\n\r\nFig. 184.--Diagrammatic arrangement of the Polarising Microscope.\r\n\r\n_In Sub-stage_: P, polarising prism; C, sub-stage condenser on stage;\r\nM, mineral or crystal. On nose-piece: O^1, objective, 4/10-inch; A,\r\nanalysing prism.\r\n\r\n_In Draw-tube_: O^2, 2 or 3 inch Objective; H, Huyghenian eye-piece.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose, screw on a low-power objective to the end of the\r\ndraw-tube (Fig. 184).[31] As the light requires to be passed through\r\nthe crystals at a considerable angle, a wide-angled condenser should be\r\nemployed, but it need not be achromatic. The objective most suitable\r\nis a 4/10-inch, of ·64 numerical aperture, but a 1/4-inch of ·71\r\nnumerical aperture, or a 1/3-inch of ·65 numerical aperture, will\r\nanswer the purpose equally well. As the whole of the back lens of the\r\nobjective should be visible through the analysing Nicol prism, the back\r\nlens of the objective must not be too large; thus a 1/2-inch of ·65\r\nnumerical aperture will not be so effective. The analysing prism may be\r\nplaced either where it is in the drawing, below the stage, or above the\r\neye-piece. It works equally well above the objective, the position it\r\nordinarily occupies in the microscope.\r\n\r\nFor the draw-tube a 2-inch objective and a B Huyghenian eye-piece\r\nanswers very well. Before screwing the objective on to the end of the\r\ndraw-tube centre the light in the usual manner, the Nicol’s being\r\nturned so as to give a light field, then screw the objective on to\r\nthe end of the aperture, and put the crystal on the stage, rack down\r\nthe body so that the objective on the nose-piece nearly touches the\r\ncrystal, then focus with the draw-tube only. The sub-stage condenser\r\nshould be racked up close to the underside of the crystal.\r\n\r\nOpticians, however, have more recently furnished a special form of\r\nmicroscope (_The Petrological Microscope_, Fig. 79, p. 112), for the\r\nuse of those students who may desire to prosecute so fascinating a\r\nstudy, and determine the optic axial angles of crystals.\r\n\r\nFuess[32] lately introduced a new form of microscope for polarising and\r\nviewing biaxial crystals, which he believes to be needed, as in the\r\nordinary microscope the opening of the polariser is scarcely a third of\r\nthat of the condenser; moreover, it is not absolutely necessary that\r\nthe polariser and analyser should be Nicol’s prisms. This fact was\r\ndiscovered by myself many years ago. Fuess utilises a bundle of thin\r\nglass plates, as in the older Nuremberg polariscope. The frame holding\r\nplates can be readily adjusted at the proper polarising angle, the\r\nanalyser being the ordinary small Nicol, screwed above the objective.\r\nThe illuminator is an Abbe’s triple condenser, of numerical aperture\r\n1·40, which can be adjusted in the ordinary way. The front lens of\r\nthis should have a diameter of 11·12 mm. and the lower lens of 30 mm.\r\nThis increase in the condenser fully compensates for the loss of light\r\nby the bundle of glass plates, and also enables thick sections of\r\ncrystals to be examined in convergent polarised light. The ocular used\r\nshould have a large field; the A Huyghenian answers best. A suggestion\r\nto return to the original Nuremberg polariser is very opportune, as\r\n_Iceland spar is becoming scarce_.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Mickel accidentally discovered that an opalescent mirror can\r\nbe converted into an excellent and inexpensive substitute for the\r\nNicol-prism polariser.\r\n\r\n\r\nRotation of Plane of Polarisation.\r\n\r\nWhen a plate of quartz (rock-crystal), even of considerable thickness,\r\ncut perpendicular to the axis, is interposed between the polariser\r\nand analyser, colour is exhibited, the tints changing as the analyser\r\nis rotated; and similar effects of colour are produced by employing,\r\ninstead of quartz, a solution of sugar enclosed in a tube with plain\r\nglass ends.\r\n\r\nThe action thus exerted by quartz and sugar is called _rotation of\r\nthe plane of polarisation_, a name which sufficiently expresses the\r\nobserved phenomena. In the case of ordinary quartz, and solutions of\r\nsugar-candy, it is necessary to rotate the analyser in the direction\r\nof watch-hands as seen by the observer, and the rotation of the plane\r\nof polarisation is said to be _right-handed_. In the case of what is\r\ncalled _left-handed_ quartz, and of solutions of non-crystallisable\r\nsugar, the rotation of the plane of polarisation is in the opposite\r\ndirection, and the observer must rotate the analyser against\r\nwatch-hands.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_ belongs to the uniaxial system of crystals, and accordingly\r\nexhibits one series of rings only, and no perfect central black cross.\r\n\r\nOn revolving the tourmaline the colour gradually changes, and passes\r\nthrough all the colours of the spectrum. It can be cut to exhibit\r\neither right-handed polarisation or left-handed polarisation and also\r\nto exhibit straight lines.\r\n\r\n_Calc Spar._--A uniaxial crystal showing only one system of rings, and\r\na black cross, changing into a white cross on revolving the tourmaline.\r\n\r\n_Topaz._--A biaxial crystal exhibiting only one system of rings with\r\none fringe, owing to the wide separation of the axes. The fringe and\r\ncolours change on revolving the tourmaline.\r\n\r\n_Borax._--A biaxial crystal; the colours are seen to be more intense\r\nthan in topaz, but the rings not so complete--only one set of rings can\r\nbe seen, owing to their wide separation.\r\n\r\n_Rochelle Salt._--A biaxial crystal; the colours are more widely spread\r\nout than the former, and only one set of rings seen at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Lead._--A biaxial crystal; axes not so far separated, and\r\nboth systems of rings are more widely spread than those of potassium\r\nnitrate.\r\n\r\n_Aragonite._--A biaxial crystal; axes widely separated, but both\r\nsystems of rings seen at the same time. A fine crystal for displaying\r\nthe biaxial system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--Crystal of Potassium Nitrate.]\r\n\r\nIt was long believed that all crystals had only one axis of double\r\nrefraction; but Brewster found that the greater number of crystals\r\nwhich occur in the mineral kingdom have _two axes_ of double\r\nrefraction, or rather axes around which double refraction takes place;\r\nin the axes themselves there is no double refraction.\r\n\r\nPotassium nitrate crystallises in six-sided prisms with angles of\r\nabout 120°. It has two axes of double refraction. These axes are each\r\ninclined about 2-1/2° to the axes of the prism, and 5° to each other.\r\nIf, therefore, a small piece be split off a prism of potassium nitrate\r\nwith a knife driven by a sharp blow of a hammer, and the two surfaces\r\npolished perpendicular to the axes of the prism, so as to leave\r\nthe thickness of the sixth or eighth of an inch, and then a ray of\r\npolarised light be transmitted along the axes of the prism, the double\r\nsystem of rings will be clearly visible.\r\n\r\nWhen the line connecting the two axes of the crystal is inclined 45°\r\nto the plane of primitive polarisation, a cross is seen on revolving\r\nthe potassium nitrate; it gradually assumes the form of two hyperbolic\r\ncurves, as in Fig. 185. But if the tourmaline be again revolved\r\nthrough half a quadrant, the black cross will be replaced by white\r\nspaces, as in the second figure. These systems of rings have, generally\r\nspeaking, the same colours as those of thin plates, or as those of a\r\nsystem of rings revolving around one axis. The orders of the colours\r\ncommence at the centres of each system; but at a certain distance,\r\nwhich corresponds to the sixth ring, the rings, instead of returning\r\nand encircling each pole, encircle the two poles as an ellipse does\r\nits two foci. If the thickness of the plate of _nitre_ be diminished\r\nor increased, the rings are diminished or increased according to the\r\nthickness of the crystal.\r\n\r\nSmall specimens of various salts may be crystallised and mounted\r\nin Canada balsam for viewing under the stage of the microscope; by\r\narresting crystallisation at certain stages, a greater variety of forms\r\nand colours will be obtained: we may enumerate salicine, asparagine,\r\nacetate of copper, phospho-borate of soda, sugar, carbonate of lime,\r\npotassium chlorate, oxalic acid, and all the oxalates found in urine,\r\nwith the other salts from the same fluid, a few of which are shown in\r\nPlate VIII.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Herapath described a salt of quinine, remarkable for\r\nits polarising properties. The crystals of this salt, when examined\r\nby reflected light, have a brilliant emerald-green colour, with\r\nalmost a metallic lustre; they appear like portions of the elytræ\r\nof the cantharides beetle, and are also very similar to murexide in\r\nappearance. When examined by transmitted light, they scarcely possess\r\nany colour, there is only a slightly olive-green tinge; but if two\r\ncrystals, crossing at right-angles, be examined, the spot where they\r\nintersect appears perfectly black, even if the crystals are not more\r\nthan one five-hundredth of an inch in thickness. If the light be in the\r\nslightest degree polarised--as by reflection from a cloud, or by the\r\nblue sky, or from the glass surface of the mirror of the microscope\r\nplaced at the polarising angle 65° 45′--these little prisms and films\r\nassume complementary colours: one appears green, and the other pink,\r\nand the part at which they cross is chocolate or deep chestnut-brown,\r\ninstead of black. Dr. Herapath succeeded in making artificial\r\ntourmalines large enough to surmount the eye-piece of the microscope;\r\nso that all experiments with those crystals upon polarised light may\r\nbe made without the tourmaline or Nicol’s prism. The finest rosette\r\ncrystals are made as follows:--To a moderately strong solution of\r\n_Cinchonidine_ add a drop or two of Herapath’s test-fluid.[33] A few\r\ndrops of this is placed on the centre of a glass slide, and put aside\r\nuntil the first crystals are observed to be formed near the margin.\r\nThe slide should now be placed upon the stage of the microscope, and\r\nthe progress of formation of the crystals closely watched. When these\r\nare seen to be large enough, and it is deemed necessary to stop their\r\nfurther development, the slide must be quickly transferred to the palm\r\nof the hand, the warmth of which will be found sufficient to stop\r\nfurther crystallisation. These crystals attract moisture, deliquesce,\r\nand should therefore be kept in a perfectly dry place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 186.--In this figure heraldic lines are adopted to denote colour.\r\nThe dotted parts indicate _yellow_, the straight lines _red_, the\r\nhorizontal lines _blue_, and the diagonal, or oblique lines, _green_.\r\nThe arrows show the plane of the tourmaline, _a_, blue stage; _b_, red\r\nstage of selenite employed.]\r\n\r\nTo render these crystals evident, it merely remains to bring the\r\nglass-slide upon the field of the microscope, with the selenite stage\r\nand single tourmaline, or Nicol’s prism, beneath it; instantly the\r\ncrystals assume the two complementary colours of the stage: red and\r\ngreen, supposing that the pink stage is employed; or blue and yellow,\r\nprovided the blue selenite is made use of. All those crystals at\r\nright angles to the plane of the tourmaline produce that tint which an\r\nanalysing-plate of tourmaline would produce when at right angles to the\r\npolarising-plate; whilst those at 90° to these educe the complementary\r\ntint, as the analysing-plate would also have done if revolved through\r\nan arc of 90°.\r\n\r\nThis test is a delicate one for quinine (Fig. 186, _a_ and _b_); not\r\nonly do these peculiar crystals act in the way just related, but\r\nthey may be easily proved to possess the optical properties of that\r\nremarkable salt, the sulphate of iodo-quinine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--Polarised Crystals of Quinidine.]\r\n\r\nTo test for quinidine, it is merely necessary to allow a drop of acid\r\nsolution to evaporate to dryness upon the slide, and to examine the\r\ncrystalline mass by two tourmalines, crossed at right angles, and\r\nwithout the stage. Immediately little circular discs of white, with a\r\nwell-defined black cross, start into existence, should quinidine be\r\npresent even in very minute traces. These crystals are represented in\r\nFig. 187.\r\n\r\nIf the selenite stage be employed in the examination of this object,\r\none of the most gorgeous appearances in the whole domain of the\r\npolarising microscope is displayed: the black cross disappears, and is\r\nreplaced by one consisting of two colours, and divided into a cross\r\nhaving a red and green fringe, whilst the four intermediate sectors are\r\na gorgeous orange-yellow. These appearances alter on the revolution\r\nof the analysing-plate of tourmaline; when the blue stage is employed,\r\nthe cross assumes a blue or yellow tint, varying according to the\r\nposition of the analysing plate. These phenomena are analogous to those\r\nexhibited by certain circular crystals of boracic acid, and to circular\r\ndiscs of salicine (prepared by fusion), the difference being that the\r\nsalts of quinidine have more intense depolarising powers than either of\r\nthe other substances; the mode of preparation, however, excludes these\r\nfrom consideration. Quinine prepared in the same manner as quinidine\r\nhas a very different mode of crystallisation; but it occasionally\r\npresents circular corneous plates, also exhibiting the black cross and\r\nwhite sectors, but not with one-tenth part of the brilliancy, which of\r\ncourse enables us readily to discriminate the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--Urinary Salts, seen under Polarised Light.\r\n\r\n_a_, Uric acid; _b_, Oxalate of lime, octahedral crystals of; _c_,\r\nOxalate of lime allowed to dry, forming a black cube; _d_, Oxalate of\r\nlime as it occasionally appears, termed the dumb-bell crystal.]\r\n\r\nUrinary salts are more readily seen under polarised light than by white\r\nlight. Ice doubly refracts, while water singly refracts. Ice takes the\r\nrhomboidic form; and snow in its crystalline forms may be regarded as\r\nthe skeleton crystals of this system (Fig. 189). A sheet of clear ice,\r\nof about one inch thick, and slowly formed in still weather, shows\r\ncircular rings with a cross by polarised light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--Snow Crystals.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the conditions of snow formation are more complex\r\nthan might be imagined, familiar as we are with the conditions relating\r\nto the crystallisation of water on the earth’s surface. A great\r\nvariety of animal, vegetable, and other substances possess a doubly\r\nrefracting or depolarising structure, as: a quill cut and laid out flat\r\non glass; the cornea of a sheep’s eye; skin, hair, a thin section of a\r\nfinger-nail; sections of bone, teeth, horn, silk, cotton, whalebone;\r\nstems of plants containing silica or flint; barley, wheat, &c. The\r\nlarger-grained starches form splendid objects; _tous-les-mois_, the\r\nlargest, may be taken as a type of all others. This presents a black\r\ncross, the arms of which meet at the hilum (Fig. 190). On rotating the\r\nanalyser, the black cross disappears, and at 90° is replaced by a white\r\ncross; another, but much fainter, black cross is seen between the arms\r\nof the white cross, no colour being perceptible. But if a thin plate of\r\nselenite be interposed between the starch-grains and the polariser, a\r\nseries of delicate colours appear, all of which change on revolving the\r\nanalyser, becoming complementary at every quadrant of the circle. West\r\nand East India arrow-root, sago, tapioca, and many other starch-grains,\r\npresent a similar appearance; but in proportion as the grains are\r\nsmaller, so are their markings and colourings less distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--Potato Starch, under Polarised Light.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular Rotation.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of studying the various interesting phenomena of\r\nmolecular rotation, a few necessary pieces of apparatus must be added\r\nto the microscope. First, an ordinary iron three-armed retort stand,\r\nto the lower arm of which must be attached either a polarising prism\r\nor a bundle of glass plates inclined at the polarising angle; in the\r\nupper an analysing prism. The fluid to be examined should be contained\r\nin a narrow glass tube about eight inches in height, and this must be\r\nattached to the middle arm. If the prisms be crossed before inserting\r\na fluid possessing rotatory power, the light passing through the\r\nanalyser will be coloured. If a solution of sugar be employed, and\r\nthe light which passes through the second prism is seen to be red,\r\nbut on rotating the analyser towards the right the colour changes\r\nto yellow, and passes through green to violet, it may be concluded\r\nthat the rotation is right-handed. If, on the contrary, the analyser\r\nrequires to be turned towards the left hand, we conclude that the\r\npolarisation is left-handed. These phenomena are wholly distinct from\r\nthose accompanying the action of doubly refracting substances upon\r\nplane polarised light. It is not easy to explain in a limited space the\r\ncourse to be followed in ascertaining the amount of rotation produced\r\nby different substances. Monochromatic light should be used. If we are\r\nabout to examine a sugar solution with the prisms crossed, the index\r\nattached to the analyser must first be made to point to zero. The sugar\r\nis then introduced, when it will be necessary to rotate the analyser\r\n23° to the right, in order that the light may be extinguished. This is\r\nthe amount of rotation for that particular fluid at a given density and\r\nthat height of column. As the arc varies with increase or decrease of\r\ndensity and height of the fluid, it is needful to reduce it to a unit\r\nof height and density. The following formula is that given by Biot:--P\r\n= quantity of matter in a unit of solution; _d_ = sp. gr.; _l_ = length\r\nof column; _a_ = arc of rotation; _m_ = molecular rotation.\r\n\r\nThen _m_ = _a_/(_l p d_).\r\n\r\nThe application of the polarising apparatus to the microscope is of\r\nmuch value in determining minute structure. It may also be defined as\r\nan instrument of analysis; a test of difference in density between any\r\ntwo or more parts of the same substance. All structures, therefore,\r\nbelonging either to the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom, in which\r\nthe power of unequal or double refraction is suspected to be present,\r\nare those that should especially be re-investigated by polarised\r\nlight. Some of the most delicate of the elementary tissues of animal\r\nstructure, the ultimate fibrillæ of muscles, &c., are amongst the most\r\ninteresting subjects that might be studied with advantage under this\r\nmethod of investigation. The chemist may perform the most dexterous\r\nanalysis; the crystallographer may examine crystals by the nicest\r\ndetermination of their forms and cleavage; the anatomist or botanist\r\nmay use the dissecting knife and microscope with the most exquisite\r\nskill; but there are still structures in the mineral, vegetable, and\r\nanimal kingdoms which will defy all such modes of examination, and will\r\nyield only to the magical analysis of polarised light.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormation and Polarisation of Crystals.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic kingdom will afford to the microscopist a never-ending\r\nnumber of objects of unsurpassed beauty and interest. The phenomena\r\nof crystallisation in its varied combinations can be made a useful\r\nand instructive occupation. Although ignorant of the means whereby the\r\ngreat majority of minerals and crystals have been formed in the vast\r\nlaboratory of Nature, we can, nevertheless, imitate in a small degree\r\nNature’s handiworks by crystallising out a large number of substances,\r\nand watch their numerous transformations in the smallest appreciable\r\nquantities, when aided by the microscope.\r\n\r\nAmong natural crystals we look for the material for the formation\r\nof our lenses, while the varieties of granites present us with the\r\nearliest crystallised condition of the earth’s crust as it cooled down,\r\nthe structure of which is beautifully exhibited under polarised light.\r\nIn Plate VIII. various crystalline and other bodies are displayed.

To a nearly saturated solution of\r\nthe sulphate of copper and sulphate of magnesia add a drop on the\r\nglass-slide, and dry quickly. To effect this, heat the slide so as to\r\nfuse the salts in its water of crystallisation, and there remains an\r\namorphous film on the hot glass. Put the slide aside and allow it to\r\ncool slowly; it will gradually absorb a certain amount of moisture\r\nfrom the air, and begin to throw out crystals. If now placed under the\r\nmicroscope, numerous points will be seen to start out here and there.\r\nThe starting points may be produced at pleasure by touching the film\r\nwith a fine needle point, so as to admit of a slight amount of moisture\r\nbeing absorbed by the mass of salt. Development is at once suspended by\r\napplying gentle heat; cover the specimen with balsam and thin glass.\r\nThe balsam should completely cover the edges of the thin glass circle,\r\notherwise moisture will probably insinuate itself, and destroy the form\r\nof the crystals.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas succeeded in crystallising “the salts of the magnetic\r\nmetals” at very high temperatures, with very curious results. In Plate\r\nVIII. are seen crystals of sulphate of iron and cobalt, No. 163; and\r\nof nickel and potash, No. 165, obtained in the following manner:--Add\r\nto a concentrated solution of iron a small quantity of sugar, to\r\nprevent oxidation. Put a drop of the solution on a glass slide, and\r\ndrive out the water of crystallisation as quickly as possible by the\r\naid of a spirit lamp; then with a Bunsen’s burner bring the plate to a\r\nhigh temperature. Immediately a remarkable change is seen to take place\r\nin the form of the crystal, and if properly managed the “foliation”\r\nrepresented in the plate will be fairly exhibited. The slide must not\r\nbe allowed to cool down too rapidly or the crystals will probably\r\nabsorb moisture from the atmosphere, and in so doing the crystals alter\r\ntheir forms. Immerse them in balsam, and cover in the usual way before\r\nquite cold.\r\n\r\n_Sublimation of Alkaloids._--The late Dr. Guy, F.R.S., directed the\r\nattention of microscopists to the fact that the crystalline shape of\r\nbodies belonging to the inorganic world might be of service in medical\r\njurisprudence. Subsequently, Dr. A. Helwig, of Mayence, investigated\r\nthis subject, and found the plan applicable not only to inorganic but\r\nalso to organic substances, and especially to poisonous alkaloids. By\r\nusing a white porcelain saucer Dr. Guy was able to watch the process\r\nof crystallisation more minutely, and to regulate it more exactly. He\r\nwas, in fact, able to obtain characteristic crusts composed of crystals\r\nof strychnine weighing not more than 1/3000th or 1/5000th of a grain.\r\nMorphia affords equally characteristic results. For the examination\r\nof these, Dr. Guy recommended the use of a binocular microscope with\r\nan inch object-glass. But it is not to crystalline forms alone that\r\none need trust; the whole behaviour of a substance as it melts and\r\nis converted into vapour is eminently characteristic, and when once\r\ndeposited on the microscopical slide, under the object-glass, the\r\napplication of re-agents may give still more satisfactory results.\r\nThe re-agents, however, which are here to be applied are not of the\r\nkind ordinarily employed. Colour-tests under the microscope are,\r\ncomparatively speaking, useless; those that give rise to peculiar\r\ncrystalline forms are rather to be sought after. For instance, the\r\ncrystals produced by the action of carbozotic acid on morphia are by\r\nthemselves almost perfectly characteristic. These experiments should\r\nnot, however, be undertaken for medico-legal purposes by one unskilled\r\nin their conduct, for the effects of the reagents themselves might be\r\nmistaken by the uninitiated for the result of their action on the\r\nsubstance under examination. For the special method of procedure, see\r\nDr. W. Guy, “On the Sublimation of the Alkaloids.”[34]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Micro-spectroscope.\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis has, from its first introduction by Kirschoff in\r\n1859, maintained its fascination over men of science throughout\r\nthe civilised world. Microscopists, astronomers, and chemists have\r\nassigned to the spectroscope a highly important position amongst\r\nscientific instruments of research. At quite an early period of its\r\nhistory it appeared to ourselves to promise an extension of the work\r\nof the microscope in pathology and microscopy, and second only to\r\nthat of astronomy and chemistry. The chief hindrances to the use of\r\nthe spectroscope were, in the early days, of a twofold nature; a\r\nwidespread, but quite erroneous view of the serious difficulties of\r\nemploying the instrument, and the want of a first aid to its use.\r\n\r\nSo valuable a means of research has this process of analysis proved to\r\nbe, that the discoveries made by the spectroscope appear marvellous.\r\nThe spectroscope was first made known as a refined instrument for the\r\nanalysis of light by two Germans, a physicist and a chemist, Kirschoff\r\nand Bunsen. In 1860, the latter succeeded in detecting and separating\r\ntwo new alkaline bodies from all other bodies from the waters obtained\r\nfrom the Durkeim springs, less than 0·0002 part of a milligramme of\r\nwhich can be detected by spectrum analysis. It is to the labours\r\nof Huggins, Norman Lockyer and others that we are indebted for the\r\nwonderful discoveries made in astronomy; and chiefly so to Brewster,\r\nHerschel, and Talbot, for showing that certain metals give off light of\r\na high degree of refrangibility; that distinct bands are situated at a\r\ndistance beyond the last visible violet ray ten times as great as the\r\nlength of the whole visible spectrum from red to violet.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the discoveries made in connection with physiological\r\nresearch, we are indebted to F. Hoppe, who in 1862 first described\r\nthe absorption bands of human blood. His results were confirmed by\r\nthe investigations of Professor Sir George Gabriel Stokes, who, by\r\nadding certain reducing agents to the blood, found that he could change\r\nscarlet blood into purple--“purple cruorine”--and in this way the\r\nplace occupied by the absorption band in the spectrum could be made to\r\nchange. He reduced the hæmoglobin by robbing the blood of its oxygen.\r\nThus, by Stokes’ and other methods, we have since arrived at extremely\r\nvaluable results, and the explanation of the difference in colour\r\nbetween arterial and venous blood; and it has also enabled us to show\r\nwherein the breathing power of the red corpuscles resides, and further\r\nexplains phenomena which before his investigations were inexplicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Fräunhofer’s Spectrum Lines.]\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope seems likely to be of almost as great use in medicine\r\nas it has already proved to be in solar and terrestrial chemistry, if\r\nwe may form an opinion from the large amount of literature which has\r\nappeared on the subject. The inception of this magical instrument arose\r\non the instance of a discovery made by Dr. Wollaston in 1802, who, on\r\nmaking a slit in the shutter of his room, instead of a round hole, the\r\nspectrum of sunlight, instead of being composed of a number of coloured\r\ndiscs, was now a band of pure colours, each colour being free from\r\nadmixture with the next to it. Moreover, he found that this colour band\r\nwas not continuous, as Newton described it, but interrupted here and\r\nthere by _fine black lines_.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Fräunhofer,[35] a German optician, discovered these lines\r\nquite independently, and mapped out 576 of them, calling the more\r\nprominent of them A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, which lines he used as marks\r\nof comparison. He also found that the distances of these lines from\r\neach other may vary according to the nature of the substance composing\r\nthe prism; thus, their relative distances are not the same in prisms\r\nof flint-glass, crown-glass, and bisulphide of carbon, but they always\r\noccupy the same position relatively to the colours of the spectrum.\r\nKirschoff and Angström had mapped out in 1880 no less a number than\r\n2,000 Fräunhofer lines, a portion of which are correctly shown in the\r\naccompanying chart (Fig. 191).\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Simms, a London optician, made an improvement in the\r\nconstruction of the spectroscope by placing a lens in front of the\r\nprism, so arranged that the slit was in the focus of the lens. This\r\nlens turns the light, after it has passed through the slit, into\r\na cylindrical beam before entering the prism. Another lens, also\r\nintroduced by him, receives the circular beam emerging from the prism,\r\nand compels it to throw an image of the slit, which may be magnified\r\nat pleasure for each ray. The lens between the prism and the slit is\r\ntermed the _collimating_ lens. Thus the following are the essential\r\nparts of a chemical spectroscope:--(1) a slit, the edges of which are\r\ntwo knife-edges of steel very truly ground, and exactly parallel to\r\neach other, and in a direction parallel to the refracting edge of the\r\nprism, to admit a pencil of rays. (2) A collimating lens; a convex\r\nlens with the slit at its principal focus, which renders the rays\r\nparallel before entering the prism. (3) A prism of dense glass, in\r\nwhich the rays are refracted and dispersed. (4) An observing telescope\r\nconstructed like an astronomical refractor of small size, and placed so\r\nthat the rays shall traverse it after emerging from the prism. Such are\r\nthe essentials of a one-prism chemical spectroscope.\r\n\r\nThe form of instrument in use with the microscope is the “_direct\r\nvision_” spectroscope, consisting of two prisms of flint-glass, placed\r\nbetween three of crown-glass cemented together by Canada balsam; the\r\nspectrum being viewed directly by the eye. The earliest constructed\r\nform of micro-spectroscope is shown in Fig. 192, the Browning-Huggins.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, Mr. Sorby who suggested that the prism should be\r\nmade of dense flint-glass and of such a form that it could be used\r\nin two different positions, and that in one it should give twice the\r\ndispersion that it would in the other, but that the angle made by the\r\nincident and emergent rays should be the same in both positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--The Browning-Huggins Micro-spectroscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193_a_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFigs. 193 and 193_a_ represent prisms of the kind arranged to use in\r\ntwo different positions, i and i′ being the same angle as I and I′.\r\n\r\nFor most absorption-bands, particularly if faint, the prism should be\r\nused in the first position, in which it gives the least dispersion;\r\nwhen greater dispersion is required, so as to separate some\r\nparticular lines more widely, or to show the spectra of the metals,\r\nor Fräunhofer’s lines in the solar spectrum, then the prism must be\r\nused as in Fig. 193_a_. This answers well for liquids or transparent\r\nobjects, but it is, of course, not applicable to opaque objects.\r\n\r\nTo combine both purposes, some form of direct vision-prisms that maybe\r\napplied to the body of the microscope is required. Fig. 194 represents\r\nan arrangement of direct vision-prisms, invented by Herschel. The line\r\nR R′ shows the path of a ray of light through the prisms, where it\r\nwould be seen that the emergent ray R′ is parallel and coincident with\r\nthe incident ray R.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194_a_.]\r\n\r\nAnother very compact combination is shown in Fig. 194_a_. Any number\r\nof these prisms (P P P) may be used, according to the amount\r\nof dispersion required. They are mounted in a similar way to a\r\nNicol’s prism, and are applied directly over the eye-piece of the\r\nmicroscope. The slit S S is placed in the focus of the first glass\r\n(F) if a negative, or below the second glass if a positive eye-piece\r\nbe employed. One edge of the slit is movable, and, in using the\r\ninstrument, the slit is first opened wide, so that a clear view of\r\nthe object is obtained. The part of the object of which the spectrum\r\nis to be examined is then made to coincide with the fixed edge of the\r\nslit, and the movable edge is screwed up, until a brilliant coloured\r\nspectrum is produced. The absorption-bands will then be readily found\r\nby slightly altering the focus. This contrivance answers perfectly\r\nfor opaque objects, without any preparation; and, when desirable, the\r\nsame prism can be placed below the stage, and a micrometer used in the\r\neye-piece of the microscope, thus avoiding a multiplicity of apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--The Sorby-Browning Micro-spectroscopic\r\nEye-piece.]\r\n\r\nA later and better form of instrument is the Sorby-Browning eye-piece\r\n(Fig. 195), shown in section (Fig. 196) ready for inserting into the\r\nbody-tube of the microscope, the prism of which is contained in a\r\nsmall tube, removable at pleasure. Below the prism is an achromatic\r\neye-piece, having an adjustable slit between the two lenses, the upper\r\nlens being furnished with a screw motion to focus the slit. A side\r\nslit, capable of adjustment, admits, when required, a second beam of\r\nlight from any object whose spectrum it is desired to compare with that\r\nof the object placed on the stage of the microscope. This second beam\r\nof light strikes against a very small prism, suitably placed inside the\r\napparatus, and is reflected up through the compound prism, forming a\r\nspectrum in the same field with that obtained from the object on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--Sectional view of bright-line Spectroscope;\r\nthe letters also apply to the standard spectrum scale (Fig. 198).]\r\n\r\nA is a brass tube, carrying the compound direct vision prism; B, a\r\nmilled head, with screw motion to adjust the focus of the achromatic\r\neye lens C, seen in the sectional view as a triple combination of\r\nprisms. Another screw at right angles to C, which from its position\r\ncannot be well shown in the figure, regulates the slit horizontally.\r\nThis screw has a larger head, and when once recognised cannot be\r\nmistaken for the other. D D is a clip and ledge for holding a small\r\ntube, so that the spectrum given by its contents may be compared with\r\none from an object on the stage. E is a round hole for a square-headed\r\nscrew, opening and shutting a slit, admitting the quantity of light\r\nrequired to form the second spectrum. A light entering the round hole\r\nnear E strikes against the right-angled prism, which is placed inside\r\nthe apparatus, and is reflected up through the slit belonging to the\r\ncompound prism. If any incandescent object be placed in a suitable\r\nposition with reference to the round hole, its spectrum will be\r\nobtained. F shows the position of the field lens of the eye-piece. The\r\ntube is made to fit the microscope to which the instrument is applied.\r\nTo use this instrument insert F as an eye-piece in the microscope tube,\r\ntaking care that the slit at the top of the eye-piece is in the same\r\ndirection as the slit below the prism. Screw on to the microscope\r\nthe object-glass required, and place the object whose spectrum is to\r\nbe viewed on the stage. Illuminate with the stage mirror if it be\r\ntransparent; with mirror, Lieberkühn, and dark well, by side reflector,\r\nor bull’s-eye condenser if opaque. Remove A, and open the slit by means\r\nof the milled-head, not shown in figure, but which is at right angles\r\nto D D. When the slit is sufficiently open the rest of the apparatus\r\nacts as an ordinary eye-piece, and any object can be focussed in the\r\nusual way. Having focussed the object, replace A, and gradually close\r\nthe slit till a good spectrum is obtained. The spectrum will be much\r\nimproved by throwing the object a little out of focus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFigs. 197 and 197_a_.--The Beck-Sorby Micro-spectroscope Eye-piece,\r\ndrawn on a scale of one half size.]\r\n\r\nEvery part of the spectrum differs a little from adjacent parts in\r\nrefrangibility, and delicate bands or lines can only be brought out by\r\naccurately focussing that particular part of the spectrum. This can be\r\ndone by the milled-head B. Disappointment will occur in any attempt\r\nat delicate investigation if the directions given be not carefully\r\nfollowed out.\r\n\r\nOpposite E a small mirror is attached. It is like the mirror below the\r\nstage of a microscope, and is mounted in a similar manner. By means of\r\nthis mirror light may be reflected into the eye-piece, and in this way\r\ntwo spectra may be procured from one lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of using the Micro-Spectroscope.\r\n\r\nA beginner with the micro-spectroscope should first make himself fully\r\nacquainted with the spectroscope by holding it up to the sky and noting\r\nthe effects of opening and regulating the slit, by rotating the screw\r\nC, Figs. 195 and 197. The lines will be well seen on closing down\r\nthe opening. This screw diminishes the length of the slit, when the\r\nspectrum is seen as a narrow ribbon of prismatic colours. The screw\r\nE regulates the admission of light through the aperture above D. The\r\nbetter objects with which to commence the study of the absorption\r\nbands are, aniline dye, much diluted, madder, permanganate of potash,\r\nand blood. As each colour varies in refrangibility, the focus must\r\nbe adjusted by the screw E. When it is desired to view the spectrum\r\nof a very minute object, the prisms should be removed by withdrawing\r\nthe tube containing them, the slit set open, and the object brought\r\ninto the centre of the field; the vertical and horizontal slits\r\nmust then be partially closed up, and the prisms replaced, when a\r\nsuitable objective is employed to examine the spectrum. For ordinary\r\nobservations a magnifying power of an inch and a half or two inches\r\nwill be suitable, but for small quantities of material a higher power\r\nmust be employed, when a single blood corpuscle can be made to show its\r\ncharacteristic absorption band. After having obtained the best image of\r\nany object on stage, throw it slightly out of focus, and substitute the\r\nmicro-spectroscopic eye-piece for the Huyghenian. Opaque objects should\r\nbe examined by reflected light, by means of the bull’s-eye condenser,\r\nor side reflector. Mr. Sorby uses a binocular microscope, which enables\r\nhim to regulate the focussing and throwing out of focus of the object.\r\n\r\nIn examining crystals or other small objects, a small cardboard\r\ndiaphragm should be placed beneath them; and when examining the spectra\r\nof liquids in cells, slip a small cap with a perforation of 1/10-inch\r\nin diameter over the tube containing the 1/2-inch or 2-inch objective.\r\nSubstances which give absorption bands or lines in the red are best\r\nseen by artificial light, while those which show bands in the violet\r\nare better seen by daylight. By following rules of the kind we are less\r\nlikely to mix the bands of the absorption spectrum with the Fräunhofer\r\nlines. For example, if the edge of a band happens to coincide with a\r\nFräunhofer line, the observer is apt to imagine that the band is better\r\ndefined and more abruptly shaded on one side than it really is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Standard Spectrum Scale.\r\n\r\nCells for use with Spectroscope.\r\n\r\nFig. 198.]\r\n\r\n_Cells and Tubes._--These are either supplied ready-made by the\r\noptician, or can be formed out of small pieces of barometer tubing,\r\nwith the edges ground down and cemented on ordinary glass slips. In\r\nFig. 198 is seen the several kinds of cells and tubes usually employed,\r\nwhile the little flat tubes commonly in use as bouquet holders will be\r\nfound of use, with the side stage reflecting spectrum as comparison\r\ntubes; being of different diameters they allow of two or more depths of\r\ncolour in the fluid intended for examination.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many other fluids the sloping form of cell (Fig. 198)\r\nwill be useful, as different shades of fluids can be examined without\r\nremoval from the stage of the microscope. The deeper cells are cut from\r\na piece of barometer tubing of about half to an inch long, one end\r\nbeing cemented to a piece of flatted glass, and the other covered over\r\ntemporarily or permanently with a thin piece of glass on the top, held\r\nin its place by capillary attraction, thus admitting of the tube being\r\nturned upside down.\r\n\r\n_Re-agents required._--A diluted solution of ammonia, citric acid,\r\ndouble tartrate of potash and soda (the last being used to prevent\r\nthe precipitation of oxide of iron), and the double sulphate of the\r\nprotoxide of iron and ammonia (employed to deoxidise blood, etc.). In\r\nsome special cases, dilute hydrochloric acid, purified boric acid, and\r\nsulphate of soda are required.\r\n\r\nThe character of stains of blood varies with age and with the nature\r\nof the substance with which it happens to be combined. This is\r\nimportant to remember in connection with _Jurisprudence_, when the\r\nmicro-spectroscope is brought into use for the detection of blood\r\nstains. The spectrum used in important cases of the kind should have\r\na compound prism, with enough, but not too great dispersive power,\r\notherwise the bands become, as it were, diluted, and less distinct.\r\n\r\nIf the blood stain is quite recent, the colouring matter will be\r\nhæmoglobin only. This easily dissolves out in water, and when\r\nsufficiently diluted gives the spectrum of oxy-hæmoglobin, which on\r\nthe addition of ammonia, together with a small quantity of the double\r\ntartrate, a small piece of ferrous salt, and stirring carefully without\r\nthe admission of air, changes the spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin.\r\nWhen stirred again, so as to expose the solution as much as possible\r\nto air, the two bands reappear; on gradually adding citric acid in\r\nsmall quantities the colour begins to change, and the bands are seen\r\nto gradually fade away; if there should have been much blood present,\r\na band appears in the red; the further addition of ammonia makes all\r\nclear again, but does not restore the original bands, because the\r\nhæmoglobin has been permanently changed into hæmatin. This reaction\r\nalone distinguishes blood from most other colouring matters, since\r\nother substances after being changed by acids are restored by alkalies\r\nto their original state. There are many other curious facts connected\r\nwith the spectroscopic analysis of blood, which are fully explained and\r\nillustrated by Dr. Maemunn in his book on “The Use of the Spectroscope\r\nin Medicine,” and also in Dr. Thudicum’s[36] reports and charts, which\r\nare the most complete. Sir George Stokes, F.R.S., was one of the first\r\nto show the essential value of the spectral phenomena of hematine,\r\nand who proved, after Hoppe had first drawn attention to the fact,\r\nthat this colouring matter is capable of existing in two states of\r\noxidation, and that a very different spectrum is produced according\r\nas the substance, which he termed _cruorine_, is in a more or less\r\noxidised condition. The chart appended to his paper[37] affords an\r\nimperfect representation of the changes seen in the spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 1.--Arterial Blood, Scarlet Cruorine.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.--Venous Blood, Purple Cruorine.\r\n\r\nNo. 3.--Blood treated with Acetic Acid.\r\n\r\nNo. 4.--Solution of Hæmatin.\r\n\r\nFig. 199.--Sir George Stokes’ Chart of the Absorption Bands of Blood.]\r\n\r\nProto-sulphate of iron, or proto-chloride of tin, causes the reduction\r\nof the colouring-matter, but, on exposure to air, oxygen is absorbed,\r\nand the solution again exhibits the spectrum characteristic of the\r\nmore oxidised state. The different substances obtained from blood\r\ncolouring-matter produce different bands. Thus, _hæmatin_ gives rise\r\nto a band in the red spectrum D; _hæmato-globulin_ produces two bands,\r\nthe second twice the breadth of the first in the yellow portion of the\r\nspectrum between the lines D and E, No. 1. The absorption-bands differ\r\naccording to the strength of the solution employed, and the medium in\r\nwhich the blood-salt is dissolved; but an exceedingly minute proportion\r\ndissolved in water is sufficient to bring out very distinct bands. B\r\nrepresents the red end of the spectrum and G the green as it approaches\r\nthe violet end.\r\n\r\n_Mapping the Spectra._--In the sectional view given of the\r\nmicro-spectroscope (Fig. 196), the internal construction of the\r\ninstrument is shown, and the arrangement made for throwing a bright\r\npoint on to the surface of the upper prism is clearly seen. The mapping\r\nout is accomplished by means of a photographic scale fixed as a\r\nstandard spectrum (Fig. 198), in the position of A A, illuminated by\r\nthe small mirror at R, and focussed by a small lens at C, so that on\r\nlooking into the instrument one can see the spectrum accurately divided\r\ninto one hundred equal parts, and scale readings can be made at once;\r\nthe only precaution needed is to be sure the D (or the sodium line,\r\nif D cannot be got) always stands at the same number on the scale. To\r\nmap absorption spectra on this scale we have to lay down a line, as\r\nmany millimetres long as there are divisions in the scale, and mark\r\nthe position of the bands on this line. Mr. Browning supplies scales\r\nprinted off ready for use. But the mapping out of spectra, as Mr. Sorby\r\npointed out, requires some consideration; since the number of divisions\r\ndepends on the thickness of the interference-plate, it becomes\r\nnecessary to decide what number should be adopted. Ten it was thought\r\nwould be most suitable; but, on trial, it appeared to be too few for\r\npractical work. Twenty is too many, since it then becomes extremely\r\ndifficult to count them. Twelve is as many as can well be counted; it\r\nis a number easily remembered, is sufficiently accurate, and has other\r\npractical advantages. With twelve divisions the sodium-line 0 comes\r\nvery accurately at 3-1/2; thus, by adjusting the plate so that a bright\r\nsodium-light is brought into the centre of the band, when the Nicol’s\r\nprisms are also crossed accurately at 3-1/2, parallelism is secured,\r\ntogether with a wider field of observation. The general character of\r\nthe scale will be best understood from the following figure, in which\r\nthe bands are numbered, and given below the principal Fräunhofer lines.\r\nThe centre of the bands is black, and they are shaded off gradually at\r\neach side, so that the shaded part is about equal to the intermediate\r\nbright spaces. Taking, then, the centres of the black bands as 1, 2,\r\n3, &c., the centres of the spaces are 1-1/2, 2-1/2, 3-1/2, &c., the\r\nlower edges of each 3/4, 1-3/4, &c., and the upper 1-1/4, 2-1/4, &c.,\r\nwe can easily divide these quarters into eighths by the eye: and this\r\nis as near as is required in the subject before us, and corresponds\r\nas nearly as possible to 1/100th part of the whole spectrum, visible\r\nunder ordinary circumstances by gaslight and daylight. Absorption-bands\r\nat the red end are best seen by lamp-light, and those at the blue end\r\nby daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\r\n\r\n  (Red end.)

Even the ordinary atmospheric changes alter the position\r\nof the bands. However, quartz cut parallel to the principal axis of\r\nthe crystal is but slightly affected, and is not open to the same\r\nobjection; but this is prepared with some difficulty. The sides should\r\nbe perfectly parallel, the thickness about ·043-inch, and gradually\r\npolished down with rouge until the sodium-line is seen in its proper\r\nplace. This must be done with care, since a difference of 1/10000-inch\r\nin thickness would make it almost worthless.\r\n\r\nThe two Nicol’s prisms and the intervening plate are mounted in a tube,\r\nand attached to a piece of brass in such a manner that the centre of\r\nthe aperture exactly corresponds to the centre of any of the cells used\r\nin the experiments, and must be made to correspond with equal care, so\r\nthat any of them, or this apparatus in particular, may be placed on the\r\nstage and in proper position without further adjustment, whereby both\r\ntime and trouble are saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsorption Spectrum of Chromule.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 I published in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety[38] a paper on results obtained by the spectrum analysis of\r\nthe colouring-matter of plants and flowers, some of which were of\r\nconsiderable interest in many respects. My examinations extended to\r\nseveral hundred different specimens, from which I was led to conclude\r\nthat the chromule of flowers is, for the most part, due to the chemical\r\naction of the actinic rays of light over the protoplasm of the plant,\r\nmore so than to that of soil. But as certain roots of plants, as those\r\nof the alkanet, yield their colouring-matter to oil, and in a much\r\nsmaller degree to spirit or water, it follows then that conclusions\r\nof any kind can only be drawn after a long and careful study of the\r\nquestion. Some of the results obtained were, however, of some interest\r\nat the time, that, for example, seen in three different solutions of\r\nthe chlorophyll of _Cinchona succirubra_, one of three solutions in\r\nalcohol, scarcely coloured, having in fact only a faint tinge of green\r\ncolour, and the spectrum of which much astonished me at the time. It\r\ngave four well-marked absorption-bands; one deep sharp line _in the\r\nred_; another, rather narrower, in the orange, coincident with D, or\r\nthe sodium-line; one in the green, about _b_, coincident with the\r\nThallium green band; and a fourth on the blue line F, nearly as broad\r\nas that in the red. The ethereal solution gave different results. It\r\nshowed only three bands of absorption, nearly the same as in the last\r\ncase (though all of them fainter); but the fourth in the blue was not\r\napparent, the whole of that end of the spectrum being absorbed a little\r\nbeyond the green line _b_. This solution was _deep emerald-green_,\r\nand even dilution did not alter the phenomena. The _acid_ alcoholic\r\nsolution was as deeply green as the last, but gave only the sharp broad\r\nabsorption-band in the red, and two very faint ghostly bands in the\r\nposition described above of the D and _b_ lines respectively.\r\n\r\nFurther additional researches on the chlorophyll of plants furnished\r\ncurious results, the chlorophyll being dissolved out by alcohol,\r\ndigested for some hours, and without heat; some plants being fresh,\r\nand others dried. Five classes of phenomena exhibited themselves, but\r\n_all_ agreed in having the red absorption-band broad, sharp, and well\r\ndefined, some having this one band only, the Lilac being of this type.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes in which two absorption-bands occur. One has the\r\nred and the orange bands, of which the Fuchsia, Guelder-rose, and Tansy\r\nare examples; another, in which the red and the green bands are alone\r\nco-existent. Ivy is the type of the class, and it is immaterial whether\r\nwe take last year’s leaves or those of the early spring; the results\r\nare the same.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class consists of the two former spectra superposed. Three\r\nlines occur, the red, the orange, and the green bands, at C, D, and\r\n_b_, as before. This is by far the largest class, and I have thirty or\r\nforty examples of it. _Œnothera biennis_, Laurestinus, &c., are types\r\nwith the ethereal solution of the leaves of Red Bark.\r\n\r\nThe fifth class consists of those having properties similar to the\r\nalcoholic solution of Red Bark described. But I only found eight of\r\nthese, and not all equal in colour power, namely: Berberry, Sloe,\r\nTea, Hyoscyamus, Digitalis, Senna, and Red Bark. The results obtained\r\nappeared at the time to be well worth following up to a more practical\r\nconclusion than that arrived at. It should be noted that in the\r\npreparation of vegetable colouring matters for the micro-spectroscope,\r\ncare must be taken to employ only a small quantity of spirits of wine\r\nto filter the solution, and evaporate it at once to dryness at a very\r\ngentle heat, otherwise if we attempt to keep the colouring matters in\r\na fluid state they quickly decompose. It is necessary also to employ\r\nvarious re-agents in developing characteristic spectra. The most\r\nvaluable re-agent is sulphite of soda. This admits of the division of\r\ncolours into groups.\r\n\r\nIt is better to use a dilute alcoholic solution for the extraction of\r\ncolour from plants, and to observe the spectrum in a column of about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in height. By this means it is quite possible\r\nto ascertain that the spectrum of chlorophyll presents seven distinct\r\nabsorption bands.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this interesting subject I must refer the\r\nreader to Mr. Sorby’s paper “On a Definite Method of Qualitative\r\nAnalysis of Vegetable and Animal Colouring Matter by means of the\r\nSpectrum Microscope,” “Proc. Roy. Soc.,” No. 92, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPractical Microscopy: Manipulation, and Mode of Using the Microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it will be my aim to discuss the best practical\r\nmethods of employing the microscope and its appliances to the greatest\r\nadvantage. First, the student should select a quiet room for working\r\nin, with, if possible, a northern aspect, free from all tremor\r\noccasioned by passing vehicles. The table selected for use should\r\nbe firm, and provided with drawers, in which his several appliances\r\ncan be kept ready to hand. The microscope must be placed at such an\r\ninclination as will enable him to work in comfort, and without putting\r\nstrain on the muscles of the neck or fatiguing the eyes. The next\r\nimportant point is that of light. Daylight, in some respects, is an\r\nadvantage; this should come from a white cloud on a bright day, but as\r\na rule more satisfactory results will be obtained by using a well-made\r\nlamp, as this can be controlled with ease, and used at a proper height\r\nand distance from the microscope. To have a good form of lamp is as\r\nmuch to be desired for the student as for those engaged in the more\r\nadvanced work of microscopy.\r\n\r\nWhatever the source of light we must on no account over-illuminate.\r\nThe object having been placed on the stage of the microscope, the\r\nbody should be racked down to within a quarter or half an inch of\r\nthe specimen, and then, while looking through the eye-piece, should\r\nbe slowly withdrawn until a sharp image comes into view. The fine\r\nadjustment may now be used for the more delicate focussing of the\r\nseveral parts of the field.\r\n\r\nAccurate adjustment of focus is required when using a 1/4-inch\r\nobjective; details of the object, as striæ, being brought into view\r\nwhen a stronger light is thrown obliquely upon them from the mirror.\r\nIf a 1-inch objective is used the light often proves to be in excess\r\nof what is required, and this must be regulated by the aid of the\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe iris diaphragm, made to drop into the under-stage, is more\r\ngenerally employed, as when racked up to the object it affords every\r\nnecessary graduation of illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Bull’s-eye Lens.]\r\n\r\nTo illuminate opaque objects the light should be thrown upon them from\r\nabove by the bull’s-eye lens (Fig. 201). The focus of such a lens and\r\nthe lamp placed at four inches from it, is about three inches for\r\ndaylight, or two inches for artificial light. A large object may be\r\nplaced upon the stage of the microscope at once, but smaller objects\r\nare either laid on a glass slide or held in the stage forceps.\r\n\r\nWhen illuminating objects from above all light from the mirror, or\r\nthat which might enter the objective from below the stage, should be\r\ncarefully excluded. _Dark-field illumination_ is a means of seeing a\r\ntransparent object as an opaque one. The principle, however, is that\r\nall the light shall be thrown from below the object, but so obliquely\r\nthat it cannot enter the object-glass unless interrupted by the object;\r\nthis is best accomplished by _Wenham’s Parabola_.\r\n\r\n_Glass_ of any kind requires occasional cleaning; a piece of soft\r\nwashed chamois leather should be used for this purpose. The fronts of\r\nthe objectives may be carefully wiped, but not _unscrewed_ or tampered\r\nwith; a short thick-set camel’s hair brush may be passed down to\r\nthe back lens, and all dust removed without doing any harm. If the\r\nobjective is an _immersion_, carefully remove the fluid from the front\r\nlens, as even distilled water will leave a stain behind. For removing\r\noil see special directions given at page 171.\r\n\r\nWhen cleaning the _eye-pieces_, which should be done occasionally, the\r\ncells containing the glasses must be unscrewed and replaced one at a\r\ntime, so that they may not be made to change places.\r\n\r\nAny dirt upon the _eye-pieces_ may be detected by turning them round\r\nwhilst looking through the instrument; but if the _object-glasses_ are\r\nnot clean, or are injured, it will, for the most part, only be seen by\r\nthe object appearing misty.\r\n\r\nThe _object-glasses_, when in use but not on the microscope, should be\r\nstood upon the table with the screw downwards, to prevent dust getting\r\ninto the lenses, and they should always be put into their brass cases\r\nwhen done with. A large bell-glass shade will be found the most useful\r\ncover for keeping dust from the instrument when not in use.\r\n\r\nWhen looking through the eye-piece be sure to place the eye in close\r\nproximation to the cap, otherwise the whole field will not be perfectly\r\nvisible; it should appear as an equally well-illuminated circular disc.\r\nIf the eyelashes are reflected from the eye-glass, the observer is\r\nlooking upon the eye-piece, and not through it.\r\n\r\n_The Mirror._--The working focal distance of the mirror is that which\r\nbrings the images of the window-bars sharply out upon the object\r\nresting upon the stage. In other words, the focus of the mirror is that\r\nwhich brings parallel rays to a correct focus on the object-glass.\r\nIf employing artificial light, then the flame of the lamp should be\r\ndistinguishable; a slight change in the inclination of the mirror will\r\nthrow the image of the lamp-flame out of the field.\r\n\r\nThe strongest light is reflected from the concave side of the mirror,\r\nthat from the flat side is more diffuse and less intense. Oblique light\r\ncan be obtained by turning the mirror on one side and then adjusting\r\nit so as to illuminate the field from that position. All the necessary\r\nmechanism of the microscope is easily and quickly learned. The\r\nobject-glasses or objectives are, as previously explained, designated\r\naccording to the focal distance of a single lens of the same magnifying\r\npower. Thus a 2-inch objective is understood to be a combination which\r\nhas the magnifying power of a single lens whose focal point is two\r\ninches from the object, and so on with reference to other powers.\r\nBy the aid of different eye-pieces an extensive range of magnifying\r\npower can be obtained; for example, the 2-inch objective with a deep\r\neye-piece will give the same amplification as the quarter objective\r\nwith the ordinary eye-piece. Indeed, for certain observations, the\r\ncombination of a wide-angled low-power objective, with a deep\r\neye-piece, or _compensating eye-piece_, is considered to have an\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nIt has been already explained that two objectives, one of much greater\r\npower than the other, but both having only the same numerical aperture,\r\nwill show only the same amount of _detail_; the higher power on a\r\nlarger scale. That is, supposing with a 1/4-inch objective of 1·0\r\nnumerical aperture certain structure is resolved, then a 1/8-inch\r\nsubstituted with exactly the same numerical aperture, but with double\r\nthe magnification, no more _resolving power_ will be found in the\r\nlatter objective than in the former. For this reason a doubt has been\r\nexpressed as to whether high-power objectives--especially the more\r\nexpensive oil-immersions, made to transmit large pencils of light\r\nthrough their larger apertures--are so well adapted for ordinary\r\nresearch as the best series of dry achromatic objectives, or even,\r\nin some instances, the medium aperture lenses; undoubtedly, for\r\nhistological (physiological and pathological) work, the latter will be\r\nfound to meet the students’ requirements quite as well as the former.\r\n\r\nThe student or amateur will do well to commence with moderate or medium\r\npowers, a 2-inch, a 1-inch, a 1/2-inch, a 4/10-inch, or 1/4-inch.\r\nThese, together with the A and B eye-pieces, will give a range of\r\nmagnification from 30 to 250 diameters.\r\n\r\n_Penetration_ in the objective is a quality for consideration, as the\r\nadjustment of high powers is a work of delicacy, and in some cases\r\ntheir penetration is impaired by the arrangement made to obtain finer\r\ndefinition. The value, however, of penetration in an objective is\r\nalways considered to be of more or less importance. It is a quality\r\nwhereby, under certain conditions, a more perfect insight into\r\nstructure is obtained. As a rule, the objective having the largest\r\nworking distance possesses the better penetration. Theoretically, the\r\npenetration of an objective decreases as the square of the angular\r\naperture increases. For this reason the medical student will be\r\njustified in choosing the objectives I have named, since these will\r\nbe better adapted to his work and pursuits. The penetration of the\r\nobjective is a relative quality assessed at a different value by\r\nworkers whose aims are widely different. But for the observation of\r\nliving organisms, the cyclosis within the cell of the closterium or\r\nvalisneria, for instance, preference will undoubtedly be in favour of\r\nthe objective with good penetration.\r\n\r\n_Resolving Power._--This is a quality highly prized by the\r\nbacteriologist. In the case of the high-angled apochromatic\r\noil-immersion, with its compensating eye-piece, its resolution is\r\nfound to be of very considerable advantage, because of its capacity\r\nto receive and recombine all the diffraction spectra that lie beyond\r\nthe range of the older achromatic objective, with its smaller angular\r\naperture. The actual loss of resolving power consequent upon the\r\ncontraction of aperture from 180° to 128-1/2° is ten per cent., if\r\nnot more. Resolution depends, then, upon the quality and quantity\r\nof the light admitted, the power of collecting the greatest number\r\nof rays, and the perfection of centring. In other words, upon the\r\nco-ordination of the illuminating system of the microscope--mirror,\r\nachromatic condenser, objective and eye-piece. If diatoms are employed\r\nas test-objects, it should not be forgotten that there are great\r\ndifferences, even in the same species, in the distances their lines are\r\napart. For this reason ruled lines of known value, as Nobert’s lines,\r\nare to be preferred. The following example will suffice to show the\r\nvalue of a dry 1/8-inch objective of 120° in defining the rulings of a\r\n19-band plate, which is equivalent to the 1/67000th of an inch. This\r\nobjective, with careful illumination, showed them all; but when cut\r\ndown by a diaphragm to 110°, the eighteenth line was not separable;\r\nfurther cut down to 100° the seventeenth was the limit, to 80° the\r\nfourteenth, and to 60° the tenth was barely reached.\r\n\r\n_Flatness of Field._--This quality in the objective has, by the\r\nintroduction of the immersion system, lost much of the importance\r\nformerly attached to it. Some writers assume it to be an “optical\r\nimpossibility.” The compensating eye-piece has had the effect of\r\ncontracting the visual field, consequently the peripheral imperfections\r\nof the objective are of a less disturbing character. It has, however,\r\nnot been made perfectly clear whether the highest perfection of the two\r\nprimary qualities of a good objective, _defining power and resolving\r\npower_, can be always obtained in one and the same combination of\r\nlenses.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, _defining_ power can be more satisfactorily determined by\r\nthe examination of a suitable object, and the perfection of the image\r\nobtained; to assist in securing which, a solid axial cone of light\r\nequal to about three-fourths of the aperture of the objective must be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, “the focal power of all objectives depends in their\r\nperfect _definition_, a property on which their converging power\r\ndepends, and in turn their magnifying action is dependent; again, focal\r\npower is the curvature imprinted by the lens on a plane wave, and is\r\nreciprocal of the true focal length. It is appropriately expressed in\r\nterms of the proper unit of focal curvature, the _dioptric_; a unit of\r\ncurvature.”[39]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--Seiler’s Test Slide.]\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as an axiom with microscopists that “neither the\r\npenetrating power nor the high-power defining objective is alone\r\nsufficient for every kind of work. The larger the details of ultimate\r\nstructure, the narrower the aperture--and the converse; the minuter the\r\ndimensions of elementary structure, the wider must be the aperture of\r\nthe objective.” Every worker with the microscope must have satisfied\r\nhimself of the truth of this statement, when engaged in the study of\r\nthe movements of living organisms, or defining the intimate structure\r\nof the minuter diatoms, or of the podura scale.\r\n\r\n_Test for Illumination._--Dr. C. Seiler recommends the human blood\r\ncorpuscle as the best test of good illumination. He prepares the object\r\nin the following manner: Take for the purpose a clean glass slide of\r\nthe ordinary kind, and place near its extreme edge a drop of fresh\r\nblood drawn by pricking the finger with a needle. Then take another\r\nslide of the same size, with ground edges, and bring one end in contact\r\nwith the drop of blood, as shown in Fig. 202, at an angle of 45°; then\r\ndraw it evenly and quickly across the underslide, and the result will\r\nbe to spread out the corpuscles evenly throughout. Blood discs being\r\nlenticular bodies, with depressed centres, act like so many little\r\nglass-lenses, and show diffraction rings if the light is not properly\r\nadjusted.[40]\r\n\r\n_Errors of Interpretation._--To be in a position to draw an accurate\r\nconclusion of the nature and properties of the object under\r\nexamination is a matter of great importance to the microscopist. The\r\nviewing of objects by transmitted light is of quite an exceptional\r\ncharacter, rather calculated to mislead the judgment as well as the\r\neye. It requires, therefore, an unusual amount of care to avoid falling\r\ninto errors of interpretation. Among test objects the precise nature\r\nof the structural elements of the Diatomaceæ have given rise to great\r\ndivergence of opinion. Then, again, the minute scales of the podura\r\nSpringtails, one of the Collembola, and their congeners _Lepisma\r\nsaccharina_, the structure of which is equally debatable. Mr. R. Beck,\r\nin an instructive paper published in the “Transactions of the Royal\r\nMicroscopical Society,” says that the scales of the Lepisma can be made\r\nto put on an appearance which bears little resemblance to their actual\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--Portions of Scales of Lepisma.]\r\n\r\nIn the more abundant kind of scales the prominent markings appear\r\nas a series of double lines. These run parallel and at considerable\r\nintervals from end to end of the scale, whilst other lines, generally\r\nmuch fainter, radiate from the quill, and take the same direction as\r\nthe outline of the scale when near the fixed or quill end; but there\r\nis, in addition, an interrupted appearance at the sides of the scale,\r\nwhich is very different from the mere union, or “cross-hatchings,” of\r\nthe two sets of lines (Fig. 203, Nos. 1 and 2, the upper portions).\r\n\r\nThe scales themselves are formed of some truly transparent substance,\r\nfor water instantly and almost entirely obliterates their markings, but\r\nthey reappear unaltered as the moisture leaves them; therefore the fact\r\nof their being visible at all, under any circumstances, is due to the\r\nrefraction of light by superficial irregularities, and the following\r\nexperiment establishes this fact, whilst it determines at the same\r\ntime the structure of each side of the scale, which it is otherwise\r\nimpossible to do from the appearance of the markings in their unaltered\r\nstate:--\r\n\r\n“Remove some of the scales by pressing a clean and dry slide against\r\nthe body of the insect, and cover them with a piece of thin glass,\r\nwhich may be prevented from moving by a little gum at each corner. No.\r\n3 may then be taken as an exaggerated section of the various parts. A\r\nB is the glass slide, with a scale, C, closely adherent to it, and D\r\nthe thin glass-cover. If a very small drop of water be placed at the\r\nedge of the thin glass, it will run under by capillary attraction; but\r\nwhen it reaches the scale, C, it will run first between it and the\r\nglass slide, A B, because the attraction there will be greater, and\r\nconsequently the markings on that side of the scale which is in contact\r\nwith the slide will be obliterated, while those on the other side will,\r\nfor some time at least, remain unaltered: when such is the case, the\r\nstrongly marked vertical lines disappear, and the radiating ones become\r\ncontinuous. (_See_ No. 1, the lower left-hand portion.) To try the same\r\nexperiment with the other, or inner surface of the scales, it is only\r\nrequisite to transfer them, by pressing the first piece of glass, by\r\nwhich they were taken from the insect, upon another piece, and then\r\nthe same process as before may be repeated with the scales that have\r\nadhered to the second slide, the radiating lines will now disappear,\r\nand the vertical ones become continuous. (_See_ No. 2, left portion.)\r\nThese results, therefore, show that the interrupted appearance is\r\nproduced by two sets of uninterrupted lines on different surfaces, the\r\nlines in each instance being caused by corrugations or folds on the\r\nexternal surfaces of the scales. Nos. 1 and 2 are parts of a camera\r\nlucida drawing of a scale which happened to have opposite surfaces\r\nobliterated in different parts. No. 4 shows parts of a small scale in a\r\ndry and natural state; at the upper part the interrupted appearance is\r\nnot much unlike that seen at the sides of the larger scales; but lower\r\ndown, where lines of equal strength cross nearly at right angles,\r\nthe lines are entirely lost in a series of dots, and exactly the same\r\nappearance is shown in No. 5 to be produced by the two scales at a part\r\nwhere they overlie each other, although each one separately shows only\r\nparallel vertical lines.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 204.--Outer Membrane of Upper Plane of Red Beads thrown by each\r\nalternate hole of grating; on lowering the focus white interspaces turn\r\ninto blue beads.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 204_a_.--Outer Membrane of Lower Plane of Beads thrown from\r\nremaining holes of grating; on raising the focus white interspaces turn\r\ninto red beads.\r\n\r\nObjective used, Zeiss’s apochromatic 1/12-inch oil-immersion, numerical\r\naperture 1·40, magnifying power 1,750 diameters.]\r\n\r\nA well-known skilled observer of test objects[41] says: “Practically\r\nthe resolving power of our achromatic objectives on lined objects\r\nreached their maximum in the late Dr. Woodward’s hands. _Amphipleura\r\npellucida_ was then, as now, the finest known regular structure\r\nof the diatoms. There appeared then nothing more to be gained in\r\nresolution when one of the apochromatic 1/12-inch objectives of\r\nZeiss, with its entire absence of colour, passed into my hands, and\r\nI soon became convinced that it possessed the power of separating\r\nthe different layers of structure in the valve, beyond the grasp of\r\nthe dry-objective. The result of this increase of power enabled me\r\nto split up, as it were, the one plate of silex forming the valve of\r\n_Pleurosigma formosum_ into three layers, and which had never before\r\nappeared to be possible; proving, in fact, that magnification without\r\ncorresponding aperture is of little or no account.”\r\n\r\n“The intimate structure of these test objects,” says Mr. Smith, “is\r\nbuilt up on one plan, each being composed of two or more layers,\r\n(1) a valve with two layers, as in _Pleurosigma balticum_; (2) two\r\nlayers with a grating and secondary markings placed diagonally, as in\r\n_Pleurosigma formosum_; (3) with two layers of a net-like structure,\r\nas in _Pleurosigma angulatum_, the fineness of the striæ or gratings\r\nof which measure the 1/50000th of an inch. Five other diatoms\r\nafford evidence of this compound structure. The presence of beads\r\nor hemispheres in one of the focal planes, and depressions or pits\r\nin another, are emphasised in the micro-photograph itself; reduced\r\nportions of the valve are represented in Figs. 204 and 204_a_.”\r\n\r\nA portion of a diatom valve, _Pleurosigma angulatum_,\r\nmicro-photographed on a higher scale of magnification, 4,500 diameters,\r\nis given further on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.--Sections of an old-fashioned Glass Tumbler,\r\nfrom photographs by the late Mr. R. Beck.]\r\n\r\n_Errors of interpretation_ arise either from the small cones of\r\nillumination afforded by the dry-objective, or the oblique illumination\r\nformerly resorted to for the resolution of these difficult test\r\nobjects, and several of the lights and shadows resulting from the\r\nrefractive power of the object itself. But the most common error is\r\nthat produced by the reversal of the lights and shadows resulting\r\nfrom the refractive powers of the object itself. To make this\r\nclear, I reproduce two reduced photographs of a small section of\r\nan old-fashioned glass tumbler, covered externally with numerous\r\nhemispheres, illuminated by transmitted light (Fig. 205).\r\n\r\nThis illustration well emphasises the difficulty there is in\r\ndetermining structure under precisely similar conditions to those we\r\nare accustomed to of examining valves of diatoms under the microscope.\r\nIf these photographs be held in front of a strong light, they at once\r\nconvey different impressions to the mind, the hemispheres appearing\r\ndepressions in the one, and raised beads in the other. Both are prints\r\nfrom the same negative, but in mounting are reversed; and therefore the\r\napparent dissimilarity is due to a slight inequality of illumination,\r\nwhich the mind accepts as light and shade.\r\n\r\nVery similar appearances to those described will result if a thin plate\r\nof glass were studded with minute, equal, and equi-distant plano-convex\r\nlenses, the foci of which would very nearly lie in the same plane. If\r\nthe focal surface, or plane of vision, of the objective be made to\r\ncoincide with this plane, a series of bright points will result, from\r\nthe excess of light falling on each lens. If the plane of vision be\r\nnext made to coincide with the surfaces of the lenses, these points\r\nwould appear dark, in consequence of the rays being refracted towards\r\npoints _now_ out of focus. Lastly, if the plane of vision be made\r\nto coincide with the plane _beneath_ the lenses that contain their\r\nseveral foci, so that each lens may be, as it were, combined with the\r\nobject-glass, then a second series of bright points will result from\r\nthe accumulation of the rays transmitted at those points. Moreover,\r\nas all rays capable of entering the objective are concerned in the\r\nformation of the second series of bright focal points, the first series\r\nbeing formed by the rays of a cone of light only, it is evident that\r\nthe circle of least confusion must be much less, and therefore the\r\nbright points better defined in the first than in the last series.\r\n\r\nThere are no set of objects which have given rise to more discussion\r\nas to their precise character than the scales of the podura\r\n(_Lepidocyrtus cervicollis_), to the intimate structure of which Mr.\r\nSmith turned his attention, and succeeded, I am inclined to think, in\r\nhis attempt to settle the structure of these very minute scales, and\r\nwhich heretofore have been described as “notes of exclamation.” By\r\nthe aid of the same power as that employed in the examination of the\r\n_pleurosigma formosum_, the old conventional markings have disappeared,\r\nand well-defined “_featherlets_” have taken their place. By careful\r\nfocussing up and down, a series of whitish pin-like bodies is to be\r\nseen, with an intervening secondary structure. A micro-photograph of\r\na portion of a scale taken by Mr. Smith shows that these pin-like\r\nbodies are inserted in a fold of the basement membrane, which, in\r\nhis opinion, furnish unmistakable evidence of the fact that these\r\nprojecting bodies are real, and must no longer be looked upon as mere\r\n_ghosts_. Quite recently, a micro-photograph of a portion of a podura\r\nscale was placed in my hands, taken by Mr. J. W. Gifford with a Swift’s\r\n1/12-inch apochromatic objective, of numerical aperture 1·40, and a\r\ndeep eye-piece, having a combined magnifying power of 3,827 diameters.\r\nFig. 206 shows a portion of the photograph which, it will be admitted,\r\nsupports Mr. Smith’s view of the structure of the podura scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--Podura Scale, taken with a 1/12 Swift’s\r\nImmersion × 3,827.]\r\n\r\nMany other errors of interpretation are not unknown to the experienced\r\noperator with the microscope, arising, for the most part, from an\r\ninfluence exerted by peculiarities in the internal structure of certain\r\nobjects; for example, that offered by the human hair, and which, when\r\nviewed by transmitted light, presents the appearance of a flattened-out\r\nband, with a darkish centre, due to the refractive influence of the\r\nrays of light transmitted through the hair. That it is a solid or\r\ntubular structure is proved by making a transverse section of the\r\nhair-shaft, when it is seen filled up by medullary matter, the centre\r\nbeing somewhat darker than the outer part. It is, in fact, a spiral\r\noutgrowth of the epithelial scales, overlapping each other, imparting\r\na striated appearance to the surface. A cylindrical thread of glass in\r\nbalsam appears as a flattened, band-like streak, of little brilliancy.\r\nAnother instance of fallacy arising from diversity in the refractive\r\npower of the internal parts of an object is furnished by the mistakes\r\nformerly made with regard to the true character of the _lacunæ_ and\r\n_canaliculi_ of bone structure. These were long supposed to be solid\r\ncorpuscles, with radiating opaque filaments proceeding from a dense\r\ncentre; on the contrary, they are minute chambers, with diverging\r\npassages--excavations in the solid osseous structure. That such is the\r\ncase is shown by the effects of Canada balsam, which infiltrates the\r\nosseous substance.\r\n\r\nAir bubbles are a perplexing source of trouble. The better way of\r\nbecoming accustomed to deceptive appearances of the kind is to compare\r\nthe aspect of globules of oil in water with bubbles of air in water, or\r\nCanada balsam.\r\n\r\nThe molecular movements of finely divided particles, seen in nearly\r\nall cases when certain objects are first suspended in water, or other\r\nfluids, are a frequent cause of embarrassment to beginners. If a minute\r\nportion of indigo or carmine be rubbed up with a little water, and a\r\ndrop placed on a glass slide under the microscope, it will at once\r\nexhibit a peculiar _perpetual motion_ appearance. This movement was\r\nfirst observed in the granular particles seen among pollen grains of\r\nplants, known as _fovilla_, and which are set free when the pollen is\r\ncrushed. Important vital endowments were formerly attributed to these\r\nparticles, but Dr. Robert Brown showed that such granules were common\r\nenough both in organic and inorganic substances, and were in no way\r\n“indicative of life.”[42]\r\n\r\nProfessor Jevons succeeded in throwing light on these curious\r\nmovements. He showed that they were not due to evaporation, as\r\nsome observers contended, as they continue when all possibility of\r\nevaporation is cut off, when the fluid is surrounded by a layer of oil,\r\nand enclosed in an air-tight case: but as Professor Jevons pointed\r\nout, these movements are greatly affected by the admixture of various\r\nsubstances with water, being increased by a small quantity of gum,\r\nand checked by a drop of sulphuric acid, or a few grains of some\r\nsaline substance, which increases the conducting power of water for\r\nelectricity. The Brownian movement, now termed _pedesis_, much depends\r\nupon the size of the particles, their specific gravity, and the nature\r\nof the liquid in which they are immersed.\r\n\r\nThe correct conclusions to be drawn by the microscopist regarding the\r\nnature of an object will necessarily depend upon previous experience\r\nin microscopic observations, a knowledge of the class of bodies\r\nbrought under observation, and the skill of the observer in the use\r\nof the instrument--that is, in securing the best focus possible with\r\nany objective brought into use. I am indebted to Messrs. Beck for the\r\nfollowing series of illustrations, showing the effect of under and over\r\ncorrection of the objective.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FINDING THE BEST FOCUS.\r\n\r\nThe method of finding and determining when the screw-collar adjustment\r\nof the high-power objective has arrived at a point of perfect\r\ndefinition and magnification is as follows:--\r\n\r\nSelect any dark speck of dust, or an opaque portion of the object,\r\nand carefully focus this small particle by working the screw of the\r\nfine adjustment, move the screw up and down until you are satisfied\r\nthe image is the sharpest and blackest that can be obtained, then once\r\nmore test the focus a little above and a little below while closely\r\nscrutinising the effect on the image. It will now be seen that whereas\r\nin focussing on one side of the best focus the object disappears in a\r\nfog, by focussing on the other side it remains in view for a longer\r\nperiod, but alters its appearance; it is now no longer a black dot, but\r\na bright dot of light surrounded by a black margin. The effects being\r\nthus dissimilar on different sides of the best focus, show that the\r\nobjective is not perfectly adjusted for the cover-glass in use.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find out whether the bright image is above or\r\nbelow the best focus, as on this depends the direction in which the\r\nadjustment-collar should be turned. To determine this it is only\r\nnecessary to ascertain which way the slow-motion milled head of the\r\nmicroscope turns when moving the objective upwards.\r\n\r\nIn the case under consideration, the bright image will be _above_\r\nthe best focus, which shows that the cover-glass in use is _thicker_\r\nthan that for which the objective is adjusted, consequently the\r\nadjustment-collar must be moved in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.--Podura Scale Test.]\r\n\r\nIf the collar be turned too far in the opposite direction, it will\r\nbe found that the bright image is _below_ the best focus, and the\r\ncover-glass is then _thinner_ than that for which the objective is\r\nadjusted. The collar must then be turned back again _until the effect\r\non each side of the best focus is exactly similar_. This effect in the\r\ncase of a circular speck of dust will be that the object disappears\r\nequally rapidly on either side, and does not instantly vanish into\r\nfog, on either side presenting the bright spot appearance, though not\r\nin so marked a degree on either side. When the object is in perfect\r\nadjustment the expansion of the outline is exactly the same, both\r\nwithin and without the focus.\r\n\r\nA different indication, however, is afforded by such test-objects as\r\nthe finer diatoms, and the podura scale, in which we have to do with\r\na set of distinct dots and other markings. If the dots have a tendency\r\nto run into lines when the object is _without_ the focus, the glasses\r\nshould be brought closer together; on the contrary, if the lines appear\r\nwhen the object is _within_ the focal point, the glasses should be\r\nfarther separated.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the objective by the screw-collar in the case of\r\nthe podura scale should be carried out in the way described, when the\r\nfollowing effects will be observed to take place, usually in the order\r\nof their arrangement.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the appearance of a podura scale when the adjustment of\r\nthe object-glass is correct, and Fig. 2 shows the effect produced\r\non each side of the exact focus. Fig. 3 shows the way in which the\r\nmarkings individually divide when all the adjustments are correct, and\r\nwhen the focus is altered the least possible amount only each way.\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 and 5 show the two appearances on one and the other side of\r\nthe best focus when the adjustment is incorrect, Fig. 6 showing the\r\nappearance of the same at its best focus.\r\n\r\n_The scales_ are magnified 1,300 diameters, and each square measures\r\n·001 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThis method, however, of finding the best focus of an objective\r\ncan scarcely be accomplished without a sub-stage condenser. It may\r\ntherefore be of service to the student, and to those who are not\r\ndisposed to purchase expensive forms of condensers, to know that either\r\nan inch or an inch and a half objective, or convex-lens mounted on a\r\nsimple wooden ring with a flange, can be arranged to slip in the place\r\nof the diaphragm under the stage. This kind of condenser will prove to\r\nbe of considerable value with a 1/2-inch, a 4/10-inch, and a 1/4-inch;\r\nwhile a still more excellent achromatic condenser can be made out\r\nof a Steinheil’s _aplanatic-loup_ arranged to drop into the central\r\nfitting of the sub-stage. As without a condenser of some kind it is\r\nhardly possible to enter upon any course of histological or scientific\r\nresearch.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Accessories.\r\n\r\nTROUGHS--LIVE-CAGES--COMPRESSORS.\r\n\r\n_A glass plate_ with a ledge, and some pieces of _thin glass_, although\r\napplicable for many purposes, are specially designed for objects in\r\nfluid. Thus a drop of fluid containing the object sought for is placed\r\nupon the slide and covered by a piece of thin glass; or, the object\r\nbeing put upon the glass slide and the thin glass over it, the fluid is\r\napplied near one side, and runs under by capillary attraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.--Varley’s Live-box.]\r\n\r\n_Troughs and Live-box._--These are made of various materials, glass,\r\nvulcanite, brass, &c., expressly for examining infusoria and live\r\nanimals. They should be so constructed as to admit of the use of a\r\nmedium power, a 1/2-inch at least, under the microscope. They should\r\nalso admit of being easily cleaned and repaired when broken; matters\r\nrarely thought of by those who construct them. An early devised\r\n_live-box_ (Varley’s, Fig. 208) consists of two circular pieces of\r\nbrass tubing, one sliding over the other carrying a disc of glass and\r\nfitting over another glass with bevelled edges to prevent the fluid\r\nflowing away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--Ross’s Compressorium.]\r\n\r\n_The Compressorium_ is used for similar purposes. By a graduated\r\npressure the fluid is _thinned out_ and a higher power can be employed\r\nfor the examination of the object. Ross’s early compressorium consists\r\nof a plate of brass about three inches long, having in its centre a\r\ncircle of glass like the bottom of the live-box. This piece of glass is\r\nset in a frame, _B_, which slides in and out so that it can be removed\r\nfor the convenience of preparing any object upon it--under water if\r\ndesirable. The upper movable part, _D_, is attached to a screw-motion\r\nat _C_; and at one end of the brass plate, _A_, which forms the bed of\r\nthe instrument, is an upright piece of brass grooved so as to receive\r\na vertical plate, to which a downward motion is given by a single fine\r\nscrew, surrounded by a spiral spring, which elevates the plate as soon\r\nas the screw-pressure is removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--Beck’s Parallel-plate Compressor.]\r\n\r\n_Beck’s Parallel-plate Compressor_ (Fig. 210) affords a more exact\r\nmeans of regulating the pressure, and can be used for a variety of\r\npurposes. It is also easily cleaned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Rousselet’s Compressorium.]\r\n\r\n_Rousselet’s Compressorium_ (Fig. 211) is a very effective form for\r\ngeneral use. It is so arranged that the student has perfect control\r\nover the pressure to which the specimen should be subjected. The\r\ncover-glass is large in comparison with that beneath; being bevelled\r\ncauses evaporation to go on very slowly while the pressure between the\r\ntwo glass surfaces is kept perfectly parallel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.--Botterill’s Live-trough.]\r\n\r\n_Botterill’s Live-trough_ (Fig. 212) consists of two brass plates\r\nscrewed together by binding screws, and holding between them two plates\r\nof thin glass, which are maintained at a proper distance by inserting a\r\nsemicircular flat disc of india-rubber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.--Glass Trough.]\r\n\r\nGlass troughs for chara and polypes (a sectional view of one shown at\r\nFig. 213) are made of three pieces of glass, the bottom being a thick\r\nstrip, and the front (_a_) of thinner glass than the back (_b_); the\r\nwhole is cemented together with Jeffery’s marine-glue. The method\r\nadopted for confining objects near the front glass varies according to\r\ncircumstances. The most convenient is to place in the trough a piece of\r\nglass wide enough to stand across diagonally, as at _c_; then, if the\r\nobject be heavier than water, it will sink until stopped by the glass\r\nplate. At other times, when used to view chara, the diagonal plate may\r\nbe made to press it close to the front by means of a wedge of glass or\r\ncork. When using the trough the microscope should be placed in a nearly\r\nhorizontal position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.--Weber’s Slip with Convex Cell for use as a\r\nLive-trough.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.--Current-slide Live-cell.]\r\n\r\nCells for viewing living objects, and watching their movements, take\r\nmany forms, usually determined by the makers for the purposes they\r\nare required to serve. The smaller glass troughs (Figs. 216, 216_a_)\r\nare made for examining the small infusoria, rotifers, &c., some of\r\nwhich take special forms, as the double or divided trough (Fig. 217)\r\nintended for viewing the circulation of the blood in the tail of a\r\nsmall fish, and at the same time keep up a supply of water and air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216_a_.]\r\n\r\nThe Frog-plate consists of a strip of plate-glass, or wood, pierced\r\nwith holes on either side, through which tapes are passed to secure\r\nthe frog in its place. At the extreme end is a shallow glass trough,\r\nmade to hold a sufficient quantity of water to keep the web of the foot\r\nmoist while under examination. In this way a continuous view of the\r\ncirculation of the blood of the animal is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.]\r\n\r\n_Growing Cells_ have received more attention from those who devote\r\nattention to the lower forms of life, the construction of which, for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining a continuous supply of fresh water to\r\nobjects under observation, and for sustaining their vital energy for\r\na long period, is of some importance. The employment of live-cells\r\nis resorted to by microscopists, as doubtless there is much to be\r\ndiscovered concerning the metamorphoses which some of the lower\r\nmicro-organisms, both of plant and animal life, pass through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.--Frog-plate.]\r\n\r\nHolman’s life slide consists of a 3 × 1 inch glass slide, with a deep\r\noval cavity in the middle to receive the specimen for observation. A\r\nshallow oval is ground and polished around the deep cavity, forming a\r\nbevel. From this bevel a fine cut extends, to furnish fresh air to the\r\nliving low forms of life which invariably seek the bevelled edge of the\r\ncavity, thus bringing them within reach of the highest powers. He also\r\ncontrived a convenient form of “moist chamber,” or animalcule-cage\r\n(Fig. 220), for the purpose of studying the growth of minute organisms,\r\nwithout in any way disturbing them for a lengthened period. This is\r\nalso found useful as a dry chamber for holding minute insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.--Holman’s Life Slide. Full size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.--Holman’s Moist Chamber.]\r\n\r\n_Zentmayer’s Holman Syphon Slide_ is used either as a hot or cold\r\nwater cell. It should be deep enough to hold a small fish or newt, and\r\nretain it without any undue pressure. When in use it is only necessary\r\nto place the animal into it (as shown in Fig. 221), with some water,\r\nand secure it with a glass cover; then immerse the upper tube in a jar\r\nof water, while another, at a lower level, maintains a current. When\r\nthe slide is on the stage of the microscope, one jar should stand on a\r\nlower level than the other, the slide being made the highest part of\r\nthe syphon. The pressure of the atmosphere is sufficient to keep the\r\ncover-glass in its place.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the various kinds of infusorial life--rotifers,\r\nfor instance--is facilitated by the addition of the smallest particle\r\nof colouring matter, either carmine or indigo. A small quantity of\r\neither of these colours should be rubbed up in a little water in a\r\nwatch-glass, and a portion taken up on the point of a brush, and the\r\nbrush run along the edge of the cover-glass; sufficient will be left\r\nbehind to barely tinge the water with the colour, and this gradually\r\ndistributes itself over the rotifers. Under the microscope this minute\r\nquantity will be seen like a rising cloud of dust, and as it approaches\r\na rotifer it is whirled round in different curves, showing at once the\r\naction of its wonderfully rapid cilia. This colouring matter appears to\r\nbe devoured, as it may be traced from the mouth to the digestive canal.\r\nMonads may be detected by this means, and the smaller forms of _algæ_,\r\n_Euglena viridis_ and _Protococcus pluvialis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.--Holman’s Syphon Slide.]\r\n\r\n_Dipping-tubes._--In dealing with infusorial or monad life it is\r\nconvenient to keep a stock-bottle ready for their reception, and in\r\na light favourable to health. When a live specimen is required for\r\nexamination, the dipping-tube is brought into requisition. These tubes\r\nare open at both ends, and vary in length and diameter. Their ends\r\nshould be nicely rounded off in the flame of a blow-pipe; in form\r\neither straight, or bent and drawn out to a fine point, as represented\r\nin Fig. 222. When any special specimen is required for examination,\r\nthen one of the tubes must be passed down into the water, the upper\r\norifice having been previously closed by the forefinger, and kept\r\ntightly pressed, until its lower orifice comes in contact with the\r\nobject. On the finger being removed, the water rushes up and carries\r\nthe creature sought for with it. The finger is once more replaced at\r\nthe top of the tube; it is then lifted out, and the contents deposited\r\nin one or other of the glass cells described. Tubes with india-rubber\r\ncovers can be had.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.--Dipping-tubes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.--Stock-bottle.]\r\n\r\n_Moist and Warm Stages._--In addition to the moist cells and chambers\r\ndescribed it is often found necessary in working out the histories of\r\nminute organisms to keep them for some time under observation, and\r\nas far as possible in an undisturbed condition, and it is equally\r\nnecessary to prevent evaporation of the water in which they are\r\nimmersed. One of the best warm stages is that known as Maddox’s growing\r\nstage; this can be had of any optician. More elaborate adaptions are\r\nrequired for the study of special organisms, and for experimental\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.--Bartley’s Warm Stage.]\r\n\r\nIn that case _Bartley’s Warm Stage_ (Fig. 224) is recommended. There\r\nare other forms of warm stages in use, many of an inexpensive kind\r\nand readily adaptable to any stage. Bartley’s has proved useful; it\r\nconsists of a vessel, _E_, three parts filled with water and supported\r\non a ring stand. This may be kept at any temperature by the small\r\nspirit-lamp, _C_; a syphon tube _d_ conveys the warm water along\r\n_f_, and through the bent tubing which surrounds the object under\r\nobservation on the stage, _D_, and then passes off through the open\r\nend, _C_, into the receptacle, _B_, placed to receive the overflow.\r\nSteam can be used for heating, or iced water for observing the effects\r\nof cold upon the organism.\r\n\r\nA simple form of warm stage may be made of an oblong copper plate,\r\ntwo inches long by one wide, from one side of which a rod of the\r\nsame material projects. The plate has a round aperture, the centre\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, and is fastened to an ordinary slide\r\nwith sealing-wax. The drop or object to be examined is placed on a\r\nlarge-sized cover-glass and covered over with a smaller one. Olive oil\r\nor vaseline is painted round the edge of the smaller one to prevent\r\nevaporation, and the preparation is placed over the aperture in the\r\nplate. The slide bearing the copper plate is clamped to the stage\r\nof the microscope. The flame of the spirit-lamp is applied to the\r\nextremity of the rod, and the heat is conducted to the plate and\r\nthence transmitted to the specimen. In order that the temperature of\r\nthe copper plate may be approximately that of the body, the lamp is so\r\nadjusted that a fragment of cacao butter and wax placed close to the\r\npreparation is melted.\r\n\r\nProfessors Stricker and Schäfer have constructed warm stages for\r\naccurate observations, and which fully answer every purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.--Stricker’s Warm Stage.]\r\n\r\n_Stricker’s Stage_ (Fig. 225) consists of a rectangular box with a\r\ncentral opening, _C_, permitting the passage of light through the\r\nspecimen under examination. The water makes its exit and entrance\r\nat the side tubes _B B′_, and the temperature is indicated by a\r\nthermometer in front. In this apparatus either warm or cold water can\r\nbe continuously used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.--Schäfer’s Warm Stage.]\r\n\r\n_Schäfer’s apparatus_ (Fig. 226) consists of a vessel filled with water\r\n(seen near the stage) which has been first boiled to expel the air,\r\nand then heated by means of a gas flame. The warm water ascends the\r\nindia-rubber tubing to the brass box on the stage. The box is pierced\r\nby a tubular aperture to admit light to the object, and has an exit\r\ntube by which the cooled water from the stage returns by another piece\r\nof tubing to be reheated by the gas flame. There is a gas-regulator, by\r\nmeans of which any temperature can be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of Preparing, Hardening, Staining and Section Cutting.\r\n\r\nNumerous methods are employed for the preparation, hardening, staining,\r\nand section cutting of animal and vegetable tissues for the microscope,\r\nthe details of which are modified, or varied as may be found needful,\r\nfrom time to time, by those whose intimate acquaintance with the\r\nsubject entitles them to make innovations and changes in this very\r\nimportant department of microscopy. In the hands of the original\r\nworker, formulæ and methods will only be regarded as finger-posts\r\npointing out a means of saving time in turning over pages to find this\r\nor that special method of staining. For this particular reason I have\r\ncollected all the most accredited formulæ together in an Appendix\r\nat the end of the book, and arranged them alphabetically for ready\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nAs to section cutting, the student will do well to practise himself\r\nin making dissections, thick and thin sections, of vegetable and\r\nanimal substances. The medical student will require no advice on this\r\npoint, as the use of the scalpel, and those instruments needed for\r\nmicroscopical work, form an important part of his education. Of all\r\nthe instruments contrived for delicate dissections, none are more\r\nserviceable than those which the student may make for himself out of\r\nordinary needles. These may be fixed in handles as represented in Fig.\r\n229, in addition to which, a pair of scissors and forceps, and a few\r\nsmall knives, such as those used in eye-operations, will prove most\r\nsuitable. The double-bladed scissors represented in Fig. 227, with\r\ncurved blades, are brought into use for cutting vegetable and other\r\nsoft structures, the disadvantage attendant upon the use of which is\r\nowing to the curvature of the blades; when dealing with flat surfaces,\r\nthe middle of the section is left too thick to exhibit structure.\r\n\r\nThe double-bladed knife of Professor Valentin was formerly held in high\r\nestimation by the microscopist, but this has been almost superseded\r\nby the microtome, which has taken the place of all other instruments,\r\nsince by its aid uniform series of nearly all substances can be cut.\r\nThe standard unit of a perfect section cutter, of any kind, has been\r\nfixed by the Royal Microscopical Society at the one-thousandth of a\r\nmillimetre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.--Section Scissors and Forceps.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the razor for cutting sections has not been wholly\r\nabandoned, the method of using which is as follows:--Take the tissue\r\nbetween the thumb and finger of the left hand, hold the finger\r\nhorizontally, so that its upper surface may form a rest for the razor\r\nto glide upon, take the razor firmly, and keep the handle in a line\r\nwith the blade, then draw it through the tissue from heel to point and\r\ntowards yourself. While cutting keep the razor well wetted with diluted\r\nmethylated spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228.--Dissecting Knives.]\r\n\r\nSome preparation is required for cutting sections with the single\r\nmicrotome. The substance to be cut must be embedded in some other\r\nmaterial, as carrot, turnip, potato, alder pith, paraffin, or thick\r\ngum, with either of which the cylinder or well of the microtome must\r\nbe so nearly filled as to leave only an excavation in the centre for\r\nthe specimen to be operated upon to occupy. The various forms of\r\nmicrotomes in use, and the selection of the most suitable, is therefore\r\na matter of some difficulty. I must content myself by particularising\r\ntwo or three typical forms in general use. As all the substances\r\nintended for cutting require preparation, it will be first necessary to\r\nattend to the following directions given by one experienced in section\r\ncutting, Mr. M. J. Cole[44]:--(1) Always use fresh tissues. (2) Cut the\r\norgans into small pieces with a sharp knife. (3) Never wash a specimen\r\nin water; when it is necessary to remove any matter, allow some weak\r\nsalt solution to flow over the surface of the tissue, or wash it in\r\nsome hardening re-agent. (4) All specimens should be hardened in a\r\nlarge quantity of the re-agent; too many pieces should not be put into\r\nthe same bottle, and keep them in a cool place. (5) In all cases the\r\nhardening process must be completed in spirits. (6) Label the bottles,\r\nstating the contents, the hardening fluid used, and when changed.\r\nAttention to details is necessary, as if hardening is neglected, good\r\nsections cannot be made.\r\n\r\n_Embedding in Paraffin Wax or Lard._--Melt together, by the aid of\r\ngentle heat, four parts of solid paraffin and one part of lard. A\r\nquantity of this may be made and kept ready for use. Melt the paraffin\r\nmass over a water bath, take the specimen, and dry it between the folds\r\nof a cloth to remove the spirit, so that the paraffin may adhere to its\r\nsurface, place it in a small chip-box, in the desired position, and\r\npour in enough melted paraffin to cover it, then set aside to solidify;\r\nwhen quite cold break away the box, and cut sections from the embedded\r\nmass with a sharp razor.\r\n\r\nTo infiltrate a tissue with paraffin, place the specimen in absolute\r\nalcohol or chloroform for an hour or two, then transfer to a bath of\r\nmelted paraffin, at its melting point (about 110° F.), and keep it at\r\nthis temperature for several hours, so that the paraffin may penetrate\r\nto the middle of the tissue. Then remove the specimen from the paraffin\r\nand put it into a small chip-box, pour in enough paraffin to cover it,\r\nand set aside to cool. When quite cold, make sections as before, with a\r\nrazor, or fix it into a microtome, with a little melted paraffin. The\r\nsections when cut must be placed in turpentine to remove the paraffin,\r\nand then into absolute alcohol to remove the turpentine, and finally\r\nin distilled water to remove the alcohol, when they may be forthwith\r\nstained. It is often found better to stain the tissue in bulk before\r\nembedding. In this case the sections will only require the turpentine\r\nto dissolve away the paraffin, and may then be mounted in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n_Hardening and Preparing Animal Tissues_ for section cutting and\r\nmicroscopical examination.--Fresh tissues are not well suited for\r\nmicroscopical examination, but it is sometimes advisable to observe\r\nthe appearances of a fresh specimen, especially if it is suspected\r\nto contain amaloid bodies or parasites. It will then be necessary to\r\n_tease_ out a small portion of the tissue immersed in a weak solution\r\nof salt and water by the aid of a pair of fine needles (Fig. 229) and\r\nthe dissecting microscope (Fig. 230).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229.--Needles for teasing out Sections.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.--Dissecting Microscope.]\r\n\r\nThe most important point in connection with an instrument of this kind\r\nis, that it affords firm and convenient rests for the hands, and should\r\nnot be raised too high from the table.\r\n\r\nThe stage should either be made of glass, or provided with a glass dish\r\nfor dissecting under water, or preservative fluid. A pair of aplanatic\r\nlenses, mounted on a focussing bar as shown in Fig. 230, will be found\r\nthe most convenient to work with.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of this nature should be always carried out in the\r\nmanner described, but preparations of the kind cannot be preserved\r\nany length of time, unless properly hardened in spirit or Formalin\r\nsolution. The method of teasing out under the light of a condensing\r\nlens is shown in Fig. 231.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231.--Method of teasing out Muscular Fibre, &c., in\r\na fluid medium under Condensed Light.]\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to state at the outset that physiological and\r\npathological tissues can be hardened by immersion in methylated spirit\r\nalone, or a saturated solution of picric acid in methylated spirit in\r\nabout a week, and it is said to yield satisfactory results, even some\r\nof the tissues being ready in twenty-four hours. The only drawback is\r\nthat sections thus quickly hardened must be stained with picro-carmine.\r\nBut, whatever method of hardening adopted, the tissue should be washed\r\nby means of a stream of water for half an hour, to remove all traces of\r\nthe hardening agent, and on its removal pressed between folds of cotton\r\ncloth or fine Swedish filtering paper.\r\n\r\nThe principal hardening re-agents usually kept in bulk ready for use\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\n_Absolute Alcohol._--This is suitable for the internal organs of\r\nanimals, glands, &c. These organs must be perfectly fresh, and should\r\nbe cut into small pieces, so that the alcohol may penetrate them as\r\nquickly as possible. The hardening is usually complete in a short\r\ntime.[45]\r\n\r\n_Chromic Acid and Spirit._--Chromic acid one-sixth per cent., water\r\nsolution two parts, and methylated spirit one part. This reagent\r\nhardens in about ten days. Then transfer to methylated spirit, which\r\nshould be changed every day until all colour is discharged from the\r\ntissue. This is a suitable reagent for the preparation of cartilage,\r\nnerve trunks, heart, lips, blood vessels, trachea, lungs, tongue,\r\nintestines, and gullet.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Bichromate._---Make a two per cent. water solution of this\r\nsalt. This will harden specimens in about three weeks. Then transfer\r\nthe preparation to methylated spirit, and change it every day until\r\nall colour is discharged. This is suitable for spinal cord, medulla,\r\ncerebellum, and cerebrum.\r\n\r\n_Müller’s Fluid._--Bichromate of potash 30 grains, sulphate of soda 15\r\ngrains, distilled water 3-1/2 ounces. This hardens in from three to six\r\nweeks. Then transfer, as before, to methylated spirits, and change it\r\nevery day until colour ceases to appear. Most suitable for lymphatic\r\nglands, eye-ball and its internal structures, as well as for tendons,\r\nand thymus gland.\r\n\r\n_Methylated Spirit_ may be generally employed, but it has a tendency to\r\nshrink some tissues too much; it hardens in about ten days. It is usual\r\nto change the spirit daily, for the first three days at least. Skin,\r\nmammary gland, supra-renal glands, tonsils, and all injected organs may\r\nbe hardened in it. (See note on the adulteration of methylated spirit\r\nwith rack-oil, which utterly spoils it for use.)\r\n\r\n_Decalcifying solution_ for bones and teeth. Take one-sixth per cent.\r\nwatery solution of chromic acid, and to every measured ounce add five\r\ndrops of nitric acid. This reagent will soften the femur of any small\r\nanimal in about three weeks; larger require a longer time. Change the\r\nfluid several times, and test its action by running a needle through\r\nthe thickest part of the bone. Should it not pass through easily,\r\nthen continue the process until it does. When soft enough transfer to\r\nwater, let it soak for an hour or two, then pour off the water and\r\nadd ten per cent. solution of carbonate of soda, and soak for twelve\r\nhours to remove all trace of acid. Wash again in water, and transfer to\r\nmethylated spirit until required. Teeth require a large quantity of the\r\ndecalcifying solution for softening.\r\n\r\n_Microtomes._--The simplest form of “hand-cutting machine” is that\r\nworked by a screw, which raises the preparation, and at the same time\r\nregulates the fineness of the section. When a number of sections are\r\nrequired, or when a complete series of sections of an organ is desired,\r\nCole’s simple microtome (Fig. 233) is in every way adapted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.--Hand Section Cutter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.--Cole’s Section Cutting Microtome.]\r\n\r\n_The method of using it_ is as follows:--Screw the microtome firmly\r\nto the table, and with the brass tube supplied with the microtome,\r\npunch out a cylinder of carrot to fit into the well. Cut this in half\r\nlongitudinally, and scrape out enough space in one half of the carrot\r\nto take the specimen; then place the other half of carrot in position,\r\nand make sure that the specimen is held firmly between them, but it\r\nmust not be crushed. Now put the cylinder of carrot and specimen into\r\nthe well of the microtome and commence cutting the section. A good\r\nrazor will do, but it is better to use the knife which Messrs. Watson\r\nsupply with the microtome. While cutting keep the knife and plate\r\nof the microtome well wetted with dilute methylated spirit, and as\r\nsections are cut place them in a saucer of dilute spirit. A number of\r\nsections may be cut and preserved in methylated spirit until required\r\nfor examination or mounting.\r\n\r\nWhen a specimen has a very irregular outline, it cannot be very\r\nsuccessfully embedded in carrot; paraffin will then be found to be more\r\nsuitable. Place the tissue in the well of the microtome in the proper\r\nposition, pour in enough melted paraffin to cover it, and put it by to\r\nget cold and hard before attempting to cut sections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--The Cambridge Rocking Microtome.]\r\n\r\n_Cambridge Rocking Microtome._--This new pattern Cambridge Rocking\r\nMicrotome (Fig. 234) possesses advantages over other instruments in use\r\nfor cutting flat sections, and not parts of a cylindrical surface. The\r\ntube containing the paraffin is 30 millimetres in internal diameter\r\ninstead of 20 millimetres, as in the earlier forms. The forward\r\nmovement is also increased, so that an object 12 millimetres long can\r\nbe cut throughout its whole length. It is provided with a dividing\r\narc for reading off the thickness of the section in thousandths of a\r\nmillimetre. The razor may be fixed either with its edge at right angles\r\nto the direction of motion of the object, or diagonally, for giving a\r\nslicing cut. The object can also be raised and fixed in position clear\r\nof the razor.\r\n\r\nThis microtome has both steadiness and stiffness in its geometrical\r\narrangement and bearings, while the simplicity and efficiency of its\r\nmechanism for advancing the section between each stroke of the razor is\r\nremarkable. Although it may appear more complicated at first sight, it\r\nis found not to be so when brought into use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.--Cathcart’s Microtome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235_a_.--Section Cutting Holder for Microtome.]\r\n\r\n_Cathcart’s Freezing Microtome._--This is a convenient and useful\r\nmicrotome for freezing purposes. Since its first introduction it has\r\nbeen much improved. The clamping arrangements give steadiness, and the\r\nprincipal screw is more effective; the freezing-plate is circular,\r\nand the arrangements made for preventing the ether from reaching the\r\nupper plate secures the object in view. This instrument can now be used\r\nfor embedding as well as freezing. The directions for freezing are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n1. Place a few drops of mucilage (one part gum to three parts water) on\r\nthe zinc plate.\r\n\r\n2. Take a piece of the tissue to be cut, of about a quarter of an inch\r\nin thickness, and press it into the gum.\r\n\r\n3. Fill the ether bottle with anhydrous methylated ether, and push the\r\nspray points into their socket. All spirit must of course have been\r\npreviously removed by soaking for a night in water. The tissue should\r\nafterwards be soaked in gum for a like time before being cut.\r\n\r\nWork the spray bellows briskly until the gum begins to freeze; after\r\nthis work more gently. Be always careful to brush off the frozen vapour\r\nwhich, in a moist atmosphere, may collect below the zinc plate. If the\r\nether should tend to collect in drops below the plate, work the bellows\r\nslower.\r\n\r\n5. Raise the tissue by turning the milled head, and cut by sliding the\r\nknife along the glass plates.\r\n\r\n6. After use, be careful to wipe the whole instrument clean.\r\n\r\n7. Should the ether point become choked, clear by means of the fine\r\nwire provided for the purpose.\r\n\r\n8. The instrument is intended for use with methylated sulphuric ether.\r\n\r\n9. In clamping the instrument to a table, or other support, care should\r\nbe taken that the zinc plate is in a horizontal position. If the plate\r\nbe not horizontal, the gum will tend to run to one side.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement made for cutting and embedding sections consists of a\r\ncylindrical tube (Fig. 235_a_) fitting into the principal well of the\r\nmicrotome, within which is a hinged plate, upon which the screw acts,\r\nas in an ordinary vice. To bring this into use the freezing apparatus\r\nmust be first removed, and the embedding tube placed in the well, and\r\nfirmly pressed into place.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaining Animal Structures.\r\n\r\nSpecific stains are chiefly employed to assist the eye in\r\ndistinguishing one elementary tissue from another. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to stain all structures, as certain parts are seen to have\r\na special affinity for one colouring agent rather than another,\r\nwhereby they become more deeply stained, and consequently more clearly\r\ndifferentiated. For staining animal structures, borax, carmine, and\r\nhæmatoxylin are more frequently employed than others. The formulæ for\r\neach will be found in the Appendix “Formulæ and Methods.”\r\n\r\n_Staining Process._--Place the section in distilled water to wash\r\naway the alcohol; place a little of the carmine in a watch glass, and\r\nimmerse the section in it for four or five minutes; then remove it\r\nto a solution composed of methylated spirit five parts, hydrochloric\r\nacid one part; shake well together. This solution should be kept ready\r\nfor use. Immerse the section in this solution and leave it to soak\r\nfor about five or ten minutes if over-stained, until the desired tint\r\nhas been obtained. Sections of skin and fibrous tissue may be left\r\nuntil nearly all colour is removed, the glands and hair follicles will\r\nthen be brought out more clearly. The section must be transferred to\r\nmethylated spirit to remove all traces of acid, then to oil of cloves\r\ncontained in a watch glass, lift the section from the methylated spirit\r\nby one of the _lifters_ (Fig. 250), and carefully float it on the\r\noil, in which it should be allowed to remain for about five minutes.\r\nThis is the clearing process, the object of which is to remove the\r\nspirit and prepare the section for mounting in Canada balsam. First,\r\nhowever, place the section in filtered turpentine to wash away the oil\r\nof cloves; this is found to answer better than another plan adopted,\r\nthat of removing the section from the oil of cloves and mounting it in\r\nbalsam direct. The oil, however, has a tendency to darken the balsam.\r\n\r\n_Logwood or Hæmatoxylin Stains_ (see Appendix for the several formulæ).\r\nStaining by this agent is effected as follows:--\r\n\r\nAfter the specimen has been hardened in any of the chromic acid\r\nsolutions in use, transfer it to a seven per cent. watery solution of\r\nbicarbonate of soda for about five minutes, then wash well in distilled\r\nwater. Spirit prepared preparations do not require to be transferred\r\nto the soda solution, but all sections must be washed before they are\r\ntransferred to the logwood stain. To a watch glass nearly full of\r\ndistilled water add ten or twenty drops of the logwood stain, in which\r\nit should remain for twenty or thirty minutes. Wash well with the\r\nordinary tap water, which will fix the dye and cause it to become blue.\r\nDehydrate in methylated spirit, clear in clove oil, and mount in dammar\r\nor Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n_Double-staining with Hæmatoxylin and Rosin._--Stain the section as\r\ndirected above, then place it in an alcoholic solution of rosin, about\r\none gramme of rosin to an ounce of methylated spirit, and let it soak\r\nfor a few minutes; wash well in methylated spirit, clear in oil of\r\ncloves, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\n_Canada balsam_ should be prepared for use as follows:--One ounce of\r\ndried balsam to one fluid ounce of pure benzole; dissolve, and keep\r\nin an _outside_ stoppered bottle. Clear the section in clove oil, and\r\nplace it in turpentine, clean a cover-glass and slide, place a few\r\ndrops of balsam on the centre of the latter, take the section from the\r\nturpentine on a _lifter_, allow the excess of turpentine to drain away,\r\nand with a needle-point lift the section on to the balsam slide. Now\r\ntake up the cover-glass with a pair of forceps (Fig. 236), and bring\r\nits edge in contact with the balsam, ease it down carefully as shown\r\nin Fig. 237, so that no air bubbles are enclosed, and with the needle\r\npoint press the surface of the cover until the section lies quite\r\nsmoothly and flat, and the excess of balsam is pressed out. The slide\r\nshould now be transferred to the _warm-chamber_, and there allowed to\r\nremain for a day or two, or until set and hardened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--Forceps for Mounting.]\r\n\r\nAny exuded balsam may be washed away with benzole and a soft camel’s\r\nhair brush; then dry the slide with an old piece of linen cloth, and\r\napply a ring of cement or Japanner’s gold size. Other methods for\r\nstaining and mounting will be found to answer quite as well--that of\r\nBeneke’s is a useful one for staining connective tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--Mode of placing Glass Cover on Object.]\r\n\r\nFor staining connective tissue a modification of Weigert’s method of\r\nstaining fibrine is resorted to. Portions of tissue that have been\r\nfixed in alcohol having been embedded in paraffin and cut, the sections\r\nare detached and placed on glass slides, and stained for ten or twenty\r\nminutes with gentian violet, ten parts, well shaken with water 100\r\nparts; filter, and add five to ten parts of a concentrated alcoholic\r\ngentian violet solution. Afterwards treat for one minute with lugol\r\nsolution, of a port wine tint, dry with filter paper and decolourise\r\nwith aniline xylol (aniline oil two parts and xylol three parts).\r\nDecolourisation having been stopped at the right point (judged from\r\nexperience) mount the sections in xylol balsam. The fibres of the\r\nconnective tissue should appear stained of various shades of violet.\r\n\r\n_Double Staining_ nucleated blood corpuscles. Two kinds of staining\r\nagents are required. Stain A: dissolve five grammes of rosin in half an\r\nounce of distilled water, and add half an ounce of rectified alcohol.\r\nStain B: dissolve five grammes of methyl green in an ounce of distilled\r\nwater. Place a drop of frog’s blood on a glass slide, and with the edge\r\nof another slide spread it evenly over the centre of the slip, and put\r\nit away to dry; when quite dry flood the slide with stain A for three\r\nminutes, and wash with water, now flood the slide with Stain B for five\r\nminutes, wash again with water, and allow the slide to dry. Apply a\r\ndrop of the prepared Canada balsam and a cover-glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.--Shadbolt’s Turn-table.]\r\n\r\nThe blood of such mammals as are non-nucleated should be treated in a\r\nslightly different way. Spread a drop or two of blood on a slide and\r\ndry it quickly; then put the slide on Shadbolt’s turn-table (Fig. 238)\r\nand run a ring of cement around it; allow this time to dry, and then\r\napply a second coating, and before this becomes quite dry place on it\r\na clean glass cover, and press it down gently with one of the fine\r\nneedles (Fig. 229), until firmly adherent.\r\n\r\n_Epithelium_.--Remove from the mouth of a frog by scraping some\r\n_squamous_ epithelium; the columnar must be taken from the stomach;\r\nplace it in glycerine, or Farrant’s solution on the slide; apply a\r\ncover-glass, and with the point of the needle press it down until the\r\nepithelium cells are separated and spread evenly over the slide. Set\r\nthis aside for a day or two, then wash away any of the medium which\r\nmay have escaped; dry the slide, and run a ring of cement around the\r\nedges, on the turn-table. Portions of the intestine of a rabbit or\r\nother animal may be treated in the same way. If it is wished to make\r\npermanent specimens of such structures, the intestine must be hardened\r\nin a two per cent. solution of bichromate of potash for a couple of\r\ndays, then washed until all colour is discharged, and removed to a\r\nsolution of picro-carmine for twenty-four hours, after which allow the\r\nstain to drain away, when it will be ready for mounting.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the handy little spring clip (Fig. 239), objects of\r\ndelicacy when mounted may be left to dry and harden for any length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Spring-clip for Mounting.]\r\n\r\n_Striped muscular fibre_, taken from the pig, must be teased out in\r\na two per cent. solution of bichromate of potash, in which it should\r\nremain for two or three weeks, when it may be transferred to methylated\r\nspirit, and allowed to remain until required for mounting. Soak a piece\r\nin water to remove the spirit, place a small fragment on a slide in a\r\nfew drops of water, and with a couple of needles tease the tissue up,\r\nso as to separate the fibres. Drain away the water, and apply a drop or\r\ntwo of Farrant’s medium and a cover-glass, which cement down as before\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n_Fibrous tissue_ may be served in the same way. _Yellow elastic tissue_\r\nmust be first placed in a solution of chromic acid and spirit for ten\r\ndays, and then treated as directed for muscular fibre.\r\n\r\n_Non-striated Muscle._--A piece of the intestine of a rabbit should be\r\nsteeped in chromic acid and spirit for ten days, then washed in water;\r\nstrip off a thin layer of the muscular coat, and stain in hæmatoxylin\r\nsolution. Well wash in ordinary water until the colour changes to\r\nblue, when it will be fit for mounting. Place a fragment on a slide\r\nand a drop of water, and carefully separate the fibres with a pair of\r\nneedles. Drain off the water, as it is now ready for mounting, place\r\non slide, and add a drop or two of Farrant’s medium, and place on the\r\ncover-glass.\r\n\r\n_Nerve Tissue._--Dissect out the large sciatic nerve from a frog’s\r\nthigh, and stretch it on a small piece of wood, to which pin both ends\r\nof the nerve, and transfer it to a one per cent. solution of osmic acid\r\nfor an hour or two. Wash in distilled water; tease up a small fragment\r\non a slide (as shown in Fig. 240), and apply a drop or two of Farrant’s\r\nsolution and cover-glass.\r\n\r\nTissues containing air should be soaked in water that has been boiled\r\nfor ten minutes; this will displace the air. (For Farrant’s medium, see\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\n_Glycerine Jelly._--Dissolve one ounce of French gelatine in six ounces\r\nof distilled water, and melt together in a hot-water bath. When quite\r\ndissolved, add four ounces of glycerine, and a few drops of creosote\r\nor carbolic acid. Filter through white filtering paper while warm, and\r\nkeep in a capped bottle. This may be used instead of Farrant’s solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Method of Teasing out Tissue.]\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of silver_ darkens by exposure; it is used in a half per\r\ncent. watery solution. Specimens to be acted upon should be washed in\r\ndistilled water, to remove every trace of sodium chloride, and then\r\nsteeped in the silver solution for some two or three minutes, after\r\nwhich they should be again washed until they cease to turn milky;\r\nthen place them in glycerine and expose them to the action of light\r\nuntil they assume a dark brown colour, when they should be mounted in\r\nglycerine or glycerine jelly.\r\n\r\nBy means of this stain the endothelial cells of the lymphatics, blood\r\nvessels, &c., and the nodes of Ranvier, constrictions in medullary\r\nnerves, are rendered visible. Sections of any of these may subsequently\r\nbe stained by logwood or carmine.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods have been adopted for staining with gold chloride. Dr.\r\nKlein’s and Professor Schäfer’s are among the best.\r\n\r\nDr. Klein’s method of showing the nerves of the cornea is as\r\nfollows:--Remove the cornea within fifteen minutes of death; place it\r\nin a half per cent. chloride of gold solution for half an hour, or\r\nan hour; wash in distilled water, and expose to the light for a few\r\ndays; in the meantime occasionally change the water. Then immerse it in\r\nglycerine and distilled water, in the proportion of one to two; lastly,\r\nplace it in water, and brush gently with a sable pencil to remove any\r\nprecipitate, when it will be fit for mounting in glycerine. The colour\r\nof the cornea should be grey-violet.\r\n\r\nSchäfer adopts another method--a double chloride of gold and potassium\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nOsmic acid, first used by Schultze, is useful for the demonstration of\r\nfatty matters, all of which it colours black; it is also valuable for\r\ncertain nerve preparations. Specimens should be allowed to remain in\r\na one or two per cent. aqueous solution of the acid from a quarter to\r\ntwenty-four hours, when the staining will be completed; but if it is\r\ndesired to harden specimens at the same time, they should remain in it\r\nfor some few days. Osmic acid does not penetrate very deeply, therefore\r\nsmall portions should be selected for immersion. This is a useful stain\r\nfor infusorial animals.\r\n\r\nChloride of palladium, another of Schultze’s staining fluids, is used\r\nto stain and harden the retina, crystalline lens, and other tissues of\r\nthe eye, the cornified fat and connective tissues remaining uncoloured.\r\nThe solution should be used very weak:--Chloride of palladium, one\r\npart; distilled water, 1,000 parts. Specimens should be mounted in\r\nglycerine at once, or further stained with carmine.\r\n\r\nDr. Schäfer employs a silver nitrate and gelatine solution for\r\ndemonstrating lung epithelium; this is made as follows:--Take of\r\ngelatine ten grammes, soak in cold water, dissolve, and add warm water\r\nto 100 cc. Dissolve a decigramme of nitrate of silver in a little\r\ndistilled water, and add to the gelatine solution. Inject this with\r\na glass syringe into the lung until distension is pretty complete.\r\nLeave it to rest in a cool place until the gelatine has set; then cut\r\nsections as thin as possible, place them on a slide with glycerine, and\r\nexpose to light till ready for mounting.\r\n\r\nOf the double stains Mr. Groves prefers only those where the double\r\ncolour is produced by a single process--or stains in which one colour\r\nis first employed, and then another. Single stains are picro-carmine,\r\ncarmine and indigo carmine, aniline blue and aniline red.\r\n\r\nPicro-carmine is specially useful for staining sections hardened in\r\npicric acid. It is prepared in several ways:--\r\n\r\n1. Add to a saturated solution of picric acid in water a strong\r\nsolution of carmine in ammonia to saturation.\r\n\r\n2. Evaporate the mixture to one-fifth its bulk over a water bath,\r\nallow it to cool, filter from deposit, and evaporate to dryness, when\r\npicro-carmine is left as a crystalline powder of red-ochre colour.\r\n\r\nSections can be stained in a one per cent. aqueous solution, requiring\r\nonly ten minutes for the process; wash well in distilled water, and\r\ntransfer them to methylated alcohol, then to absolute alcohol, after\r\nwhich they are rendered transparent by immersing in oil of cloves or\r\nbenzole, before mounting in balsam or dammar.\r\n\r\nTo summarise Mr. Groves’ recommendations:--\r\n\r\n1. Let the material be quite fresh.\r\n\r\n2. (_a_) Take care that the hardening or softening fluid is not too\r\nstrong. (_b_) Use a large bulk of fluid in proportion to the material.\r\n(_c_) Change the fluid frequently. (_d_) If freezing be employed, take\r\ncare that the specimen is thoroughly frozen.\r\n\r\n3. (_a_) Always use a sharp razor. (_b_) Take it with one diagonal\r\nsweep through the material. (_c_) Make the sections as thin as\r\npossible; and (_d_) Remove each one as soon as cut, for if sections\r\naccumulate on the knife or razor they are sure to get torn.\r\n\r\n4. (_a_) Do not be in a hurry to stain, but (_b_) Remember that a weak\r\ncolouring solution permeates the section better, and produces the best\r\nresults; and (_c_) That the thinner the section the better it will take\r\nthe stains.\r\n\r\n5. (_a_) Always use glass slips and covers free from scratches and\r\nbubbles, and chemically clean. (_b_) Never use any but extra thin\r\ncircular covers, so that the specimens may be used with high powers.\r\n(_c_) Always use cold preservatives, except in the case of glycerine\r\njelly, and never use warmth to hasten the drying of balsam or dammar,\r\nbut run a ring of cement round the cover.\r\n\r\n6. Label specimens correctly; keep them in a flat tray, and in the\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble and Treble Staining.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Stirling[46] furnishes a brief but useful account of the methods\r\nhe has employed with much success.\r\n\r\n_Osmic Acid and Picro-carmine._--Mix on a glass slide a drop of the\r\nblood of newt or frog and a drop of a one per cent. aqueous solution\r\nof osmic acid, and allow the slide to stand by. This will fix the\r\ncorpuscles without altering their shape. At the end of five minutes\r\nremove any excess of acid with blotting-paper, add a drop of a solution\r\nof picro-carmine, and a trace of glycerine to prevent evaporation, and\r\nset aside for three or four hours to see that no overstaining takes\r\nplace. At the end of this time the nucleus will be found to be stained\r\nred, and the perinuclear part yellow.\r\n\r\n_Picric Acid and Picro-carmine._--Place a drop of the blood of a frog\r\nor newt on a glass slide, and add a drop of a saturated solution\r\nof picric acid: put the slide aside and allow it to remain for\r\nfive minutes; at the end of that time, when the acid has fixed the\r\ncorpuscles (that is, coagulated their contents), any excess of acid\r\nshould be removed as before. A drop of solution of picro-carmine\r\nshould now be added, and a trace of glycerine, and the preparation set\r\naside for an hour. At the end of that time remove the picro-carmine\r\nsolution by means of a narrow slip of blotting-paper, and add a drop of\r\nFarrant’s solution of glycerine and apply glass-cover. The perinuclear\r\npart of the corpuscles will be seen to be highly granular and of a\r\ndeep orange colour, whilst the nucleus is stained red. Some of the\r\ncorpuscles will appear of a delicate yellow colour, and threads are\r\nseen extending from the nucleus to the envelopes. The preparation\r\nshould be preserved and mounted in glycerine.\r\n\r\n_Picro-carmine and Aniline Dye._--For glandular tissue, none of the\r\naniline dyes answer so well as iodine green, used in the form of a one\r\nper cent. watery solution. Stain the tissue in picro-carmine, wash\r\nit in distilled water acidulated with acetic acid, and stain it in a\r\nsolution of iodine green. As it acts rapidly, care must be taken not to\r\noverstain. Wash the section in water, and then transfer it to alcohol;\r\nfinally clear with oil of cloves. The washing should be done rapidly,\r\nas the spirit dissolves out the green dye. All preparations stained\r\nwith iodine green must be mounted in dammar.\r\n\r\n_Picro-carmine and Iodine Green._--Stain a section of the cancellated\r\nhead of a very young bone (fœtal bone) in picro-carmine, wash it in\r\ndistilled water, and stain it with iodine green, and mount in dammar.\r\nAll newly-formed bone is stained red; that in the centre of the osseous\r\ntrabeculæ, the residue of the calcified cartilage in which the bone\r\nis deposited, is stained green. Many of the bone corpuscles are also\r\nstained green.\r\n\r\nOssifying cartilage, the back part of the tongue, Peyer’s Patches,\r\nsolitary-glands, trachea, and bronchus, may all be treated in the\r\nsame way. In preparing the skin, take a vertical section from the\r\nsole of the foot of a fœtus. The cuticle and superficial layers of\r\nthe epithelium are dyed yellow, the rete Malpighii green; and the\r\ncontinuation of these cells can be traced into the ducts of the\r\nsweat-glands, which are green, and form a marked contrast to the red\r\nstained connective tissue of the cutis vera, through which they have to\r\nascend to reach the surface. The outer layer of the grey matter of the\r\ncerebellum with Purkinge’s cells is, when double stained, red, while\r\nthe inner or granular layer is green. Logwood and iodine green stains\r\nthe mucous glands of the tongue green, and the serous glands, lilac\r\nlogwood stain.\r\n\r\n_Eosin and Iodine Green._--Eosin is used as the ground colour. Stain\r\nthe tissue in an alcoholic solution of eosin, which will colour it\r\nvery rapidly, usually in a few seconds. Wash the section thoroughly\r\nin water acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric acid, a one per cent.\r\nsolution, and stain with iodine green. This will double stain bone and\r\ncerebellum; but if logwood is substituted for the latter, the cerebrum\r\nand general substance become stained by the eosin, while the logwood\r\ncolours the nerve-cells a lilac.\r\n\r\n_Gold Chloride and Aniline Dyes._--The tissue must be impregnated with\r\nchloride of gold, and then stained with either aniline blue, iodine\r\ngreen, or rosin. The tail of a young rat, containing as it does so many\r\ndifferent structures, is an excellent material for experimenting upon.\r\nRemove the skin from the tail, and place pieces half an inch long into\r\nthe juice of a fresh lemon for five minutes, wash it to get rid of the\r\nacid. The fine tendons swell up under the action of the lemon acid, and\r\npermit of the more ready action of the chloride of gold solution. Place\r\nthe piece for an hour or more in a one per cent. solution of gold,\r\nremove it and wash it thoroughly, and then place it in a twenty-five\r\nper cent. solution of formic acid for twenty-four hours. This reduces\r\nthe gold. During the process of reduction the preparation must be\r\nkept in the dark. The osseous portion has then to be decalcified in\r\nthe ordinary way, with a mixture of chromic and nitric acid. After\r\ndecalcification preserve the whole in alcohol. Transverse sections of\r\nthe decalcified tail are made, and may be stained with a red dye, as\r\nrosin, and afterwards with a watery solution of iodine green. Mount in\r\ndammar.\r\n\r\n\r\nInjecting Small Animal Bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--Injecting Syringe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Water Bath and Melting Vessels.]\r\n\r\nThe injection of animal bodies practised by the older anatomists, to\r\nrender the vascular system more apparent, has not been superseded by\r\nthe more modern methods of staining. The method of injecting even\r\nsmall bodies requires some skill, and a few pieces of apparatus made\r\nexpressly for the purpose. First, a special form of brass syringe of\r\nsuch a size that it may be grasped with the right hand, the thumb at\r\nthe same time covering the button at the top of the piston-rod when\r\ndrawn out to the full. In Fig. 241 the piston rod is seen withdrawn,\r\n_a_ is the body, with a screw at the top for firmly screwing down the\r\ncover, _b_, after the piston, _c_, is replaced; _e_ is a stop-cock,\r\nto the end of which either of the smaller cannulæ, _g_, is affixed.\r\nThe transverse wires are for securing them tightly with thread to the\r\nvessels into which they are to be inserted. In addition to the syringe,\r\ntwo or three tinned vessels are required to contain size, injecting\r\nfluid, and hot water.\r\n\r\nThe size must be kept hot by the aid of a water bath; if a naked\r\nfire be used there is danger of burning it. A convenient form of\r\napparatus for melting the size, and afterwards keeping it at a proper\r\ntemperature, is Fig. 242.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--Artery Needle.]\r\n\r\nA pair of strong forceps for seizing the vessel, and a small needle\r\n(Fig. 243) is also necessary for passing the thread round the vessel\r\ninto which the injection pipe has been inserted. These complete the\r\nlist of apparatus. To prepare the material for opaque injections,\r\ntake one pound of the finest and most transparent glue, break it into\r\nsmall pieces, put it into an earthen pot, and pour on it three pints\r\nof cold water; let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring it now and\r\nthen with a stick; set it over a slow fire for half an hour, or until\r\nall the pieces are perfectly dissolved, skim off the froth from the\r\nsurface, and strain through a flannel for use. Isinglass and cuttings\r\nof parchment make an excellent size, and are preferable for particular\r\ninjections. If gelatine be employed an ounce to a pint of water will be\r\nsufficiently strong, but in very hot weather it is necessary to add a\r\nlittle more gelatine. It must be first soaked in part of the cold water\r\nuntil it swells up and becomes soft, when the rest of the water, made\r\nhot, is to be added. The size thus prepared may be fixed with finely\r\nlevigated vermilion, chrome-yellow, blue salts, or flake white.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the subject, the principal points to be attained are: to\r\ndissolve the fluids and completely empty the vessels; relax the solids;\r\nand prevent the injection from coagulating too soon. For this purpose\r\nit is necessary to place the animal, or part to be injected, in warm\r\nwater, as hot as the operator’s hand will bear. This should be kept at\r\nnearly the same temperature for some time by occasionally adding hot\r\nwater. The length of time required is in proportion to the size of the\r\npart and the amount of its rigidity.\r\n\r\n_Injecting the systems of Vessels with different colours: Carmine and\r\nGelatine Injection._--Carmine 30 grains, strong liquid ammonia 60\r\ndrops, glacial acetic acid 43 drops, gelatine solution (one ounce in\r\nsix ounces of water) two ounces, water one ounce: dissolve the carmine\r\nin the ammonia and water in a test tube, and mix it with one half of\r\nthe warm gelatine, add the acid to the remaining half of gelatine, and\r\ndrop it little by little into the carmine mixture, stirring it well\r\nwith a glass rod during the mixing; filter through flannel, and add a\r\nfew drops of carbolic acid to make it keep. It is very important that\r\nthe stain should be quite _neutral_, the test of which is the colour\r\nand smell of the fluid. It should be a bright red, and all trace of\r\nsmell of ammonia must be removed.\r\n\r\n_Prussian or Berlin Blue and Gelatine._--Take 1-1/2 ounces of gelatine,\r\nplace it in a vessel and cover it with water; allow it to stand until\r\nall the water is absorbed and the gelatine is quite soft, then dissolve\r\nin hot water. Dissolve one drachm (60 grains) of Prussian or Berlin\r\nblue in six ounces of water, and gradually mix it with the gelatine\r\nsolution, stirring well with a glass rod during the mixing; then filter\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n_Watery Solution of Berlin Blue._--Dissolve 2-1/2 drachms of the blue\r\nin 18 ounces of distilled water, and filter. This staining fluid is\r\nused for injecting the lymphatic system.\r\n\r\n_Directions for Injecting._--The animal to be injected must be first\r\nkilled by chloroform, and injected while still warm; to secure this\r\nplace the body in a water bath, at a temperature of 104° Fahrenheit.\r\nExpose the main artery of the parts to be injected, clear a small\r\nportion of it from the surrounding tissues, and place a ligature of\r\nthin tissue or silk round it, by means of the small artery needle (Fig.\r\n243). With a pair of sharp-pointed scissors make an oblique slit in the\r\nwall of the vessel, insert the cannula, and tie the ligature firmly\r\nover the artery behind the point of the cannula, into which put the\r\nstop-cock. Fill the syringe with injection fluid, which must not be too\r\nwarm, and take care not to draw up any air-bubbles; insert the nozzle\r\nof the syringe into the stop-cock and force in a little fluid; remove\r\nthe syringe so that the air may escape, re-insert the syringe, repeat\r\nthe process until no air-bubbles escape, and then proceed slowly with\r\nthe injection. Half an hour will be required to complete the process\r\nin an animal the size of a rabbit. To judge of the completeness of\r\nthe injection, examine the vascular parts of the lips, tongues and\r\neyes; if satisfactory, tie the ligature round the artery and withdraw\r\nthe syringe; place the animal in cold water for an hour to consolidate\r\nthe injection fluid. When cold dissect out the organs, cut them up,\r\nand place them in methylated spirit to harden. Change the spirit every\r\ntwenty-four hours for the first three days. The hardening process will\r\nbe complete in ten days.\r\n\r\nTo inject lymphatics by the puncture process, a small-sized\r\nsubcutaneous syringe should be used, filled with a watery solution of\r\nthe prepared stains. Thrust the nozzle into the pad of the foot, (or\r\ntongue), and then rub the limb to cause the injection fluid to flow\r\nalong the lymphatic vessels into the glands.\r\n\r\nWhen the blue stain is used add a few drops of acetic acid to the\r\nspirit while the hardening process is going on.\r\n\r\n_Of Injecting Different Systems of Vessels with Different Colours._--It\r\nis often desirable to inject different systems of vessels distributed\r\nto a part with different colours, in order to ascertain the arrangement\r\nof each set of vessels and their relation to each other. A portion of\r\nthe gall-bladder in which the veins have been injected with white lead,\r\nand the arteries with vermilion, forms an attractive preparation. Each\r\nartery, even to its smallest branches, is seen to be accompanied by\r\ntwo small veins, one lying on either side of it. By this method four\r\ndifferent sets of tubes have been injected--the artery with vermilion,\r\nthe portal vein with white lead, the duct with Prussian blue, and the\r\nhepatic vein with lake. There are also opaque colouring matters which\r\nmay be employed for double injections.\r\n\r\n_Injecting the Lower Animals._--The vessels of fishes are exceedingly\r\ntender, and require great caution in filling them. It is often\r\ndifficult or quite impossible to tie the pipe in the vessel of a fish,\r\nand it will generally be found a much easier process to cut off the\r\ntail of the fish, and put the pipe into the divided vessel which lies\r\nimmediately beneath the spinal column. In this simple manner beautiful\r\ninjections of fish may be made.\r\n\r\n_Mollusca_ (slug, snail, oyster, &c.).--The tenuity of the vessels of\r\nthe mollusc often renders it impossible to tie the pipe in the usual\r\nmanner. The capillaries are, however, usually very large, so that the\r\ninjection runs very readily. In different parts of the bodies of these\r\nanimals are numerous lacunæ or spaces, which communicate directly\r\nwith the vessels. Now, if an opening be made through the integument of\r\nthe muscular foot of the animal, a pipe may be inserted, and thus the\r\nvessels may be injected from these lacunæ with comparative facility.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--Injections of insects may be made by forcing the injection\r\ninto the general abdominal cavity, when it passes into the dorsal\r\nvessel and is afterwards distributed throughout the system. The\r\nsuperfluous injection is then washed away, and such parts of the body\r\nas may be required removed for examination.\r\n\r\nNatural injection of Medusæ may be effected without injuring the\r\nvessels, with an opening at the side remote from it. The medusa must\r\nbe placed in a glass vessel, with the bell downwards, and a bell-jar\r\nending in a narrow tube above is placed over it and made air-tight;\r\nthe medusa is then covered with the injection-mass, the air in the\r\nglass is exhausted, and as the sea-water runs out by slits in the lower\r\nside of the annular canal, the coloured fluid runs in. In the case\r\nof leeches and large species of earthworms, the natural injection is\r\nmade from the ventral sinus. In all cases a glass tube is used, with a\r\nfinely drawn-out point. The injection is complete when the injection\r\nissues from the counter-opening. Besides the animals mentioned, large\r\ncaterpillars, beetles, and larvæ of various kinds are favourable\r\nobjects for injection; the glass cannula being introduced into the\r\nposterior end of the dorsal vessel, and the counter-opening made in the\r\nventral vessel, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n_Staining Living Protoplasm with Bismarck Brown._--Henneguy having\r\ntreated _Paramœcium aurelia_ with an aqueous solution of aniline\r\nbrown (known as “Bismarck Brown”), found that they assumed an intense\r\nyellow-brown colour. The colour first appears in the vacuoles of the\r\nprotoplasm, and then in the protoplasm itself, the nucleus generally\r\nremaining colourless, and becoming more visible than in the normal\r\nstate. If a yellow-tinted paramœcium be compressed so as to cause a\r\nsmall quantity of the protoplasm to exude, it is seen that it really is\r\nthe protoplasmic substance which becomes coloured. All the Infusoria\r\nmay be stained with Bismarck brown, but no other aniline colour\r\nemployed exhibits the same property--they merely stain the Infusoria\r\nafter death, and are in fact poisonous. Living protoplasm does not as\r\na rule absorb colouring matters, and as Infusoria are chiefly composed\r\nof protoplasm, attempts have been made to ascertain whether protoplasm\r\nin general, of animal or vegetable origin, behaved in the same way in\r\nthe presence of aniline brown. A tolerably strong solution of Bismarck\r\nbrown was therefore injected under the skin of the back of several\r\nfrogs. After some hours the tissues became uniformly tinted a deep\r\nyellow; the muscular substance especially had a very marked yellow\r\ntint. The frogs did not appear in the least incommoded. Small fry of\r\ntrout placed in a solution stained rapidly and continued to swim about.\r\nFinally, a guinea-pig, under whose skin some powder of Bismarck brown\r\nhad been introduced, soon presented a yellow staining of the buccal and\r\nanal mucous membranes and of the skin. Seeds of cress sown on cotton\r\nsoaked with a concentrated solution of the Bismarck brown sprouted,\r\nand the young plants were strongly stained brown; but on crushing the\r\ntissues and examining them under the microscope, it was ascertained\r\nthat the protoplasm of the cells was very feebly coloured: the vessels,\r\non the contrary, showed a deep brown stain up to their termination of\r\nthe leaf. The mycelium of a mould developed in a solution of Bismarck\r\nbrown was clearly stained after having been washed in water, whilst\r\nit is known that the mycelium, which frequently forms in coloured\r\nsolutions, picro-carmine, hæmatoxylin, &c., remained perfectly\r\ncolourless. Other aniline colours injected under the skin of frogs\r\nstained the connective tissue as deeply as did the Bismarck brown; but\r\nthe striæ of muscle remained colourless. We may conclude, then, that\r\nBismarck brown possesses the quality of colouring living protoplasm\r\nboth in plants and in animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting, Grinding, and Mounting Hard Structures.\r\n\r\nTake the femur of cat, or rabbit, remove as much of the muscle as\r\npossible and macerate it in water until quite clean; on removal hang it\r\nup to dry. With a fine saw make transverse and longitudinal sections.\r\nFile the section down until flat, and smooth. Take some Canada balsam,\r\nplace a piece on a square of glass and warm gently over a lamp until\r\nthe balsam is plastic enough to allow of the section being pressed\r\ninto it, and set it aside to consolidate. Take a hone (“Water-of-Ayr”\r\nstone), moisten it with water, and rub one side of the section upon it\r\nuntil quite smooth, then place the glass slip, with the section still\r\nattached, into methylated spirit, and in a very short time the section\r\nwill be separated; wash it and remount it on the reverse side, and\r\nproceed to rub it down on the hone until it appears to be thin enough\r\nfor mounting. Polish both sides on a polishing strop with Tripoli\r\npowder, and mount in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--Small Lathe for cutting and polishing\r\nSections of Teeth.]\r\n\r\n_Teeth._--The enamel of the teeth is a much harder structure than\r\nthat of bone, consequently it is found necessary to have recourse\r\nto a cutting machine. Hand machines have been introduced for this\r\npurpose, but the small lathe described in the earlier editions of my\r\nbook has in no way been superseded by later cutting machines. Fig. 244\r\nrepresents the small lathe used for cutting and polishing every kind of\r\nhard substance. With regard to the teeth, two sections should be made\r\nperpendicular to one another through the middle of the crown and fang\r\nof the tooth from before backwards, and from right to left, which will\r\nshow the peculiar structure of the enamel. The section must be cemented\r\nto the carrier of the stock of the lathe, or to the metal plate _a_,\r\nand kept in position by the steel holder _b_; the wheel being set in\r\nmotion by the first treadle. The embedding materials in use are either\r\ngum-shellac or Canada balsam. The former is more generally employed by\r\nthe lapidary and grinder of lenses than the latter. As the enamel is\r\nliable to fracture under the saw, it will be necessary to lessen the\r\nfriction by dripping water on the saw as it is made to revolve. Thick\r\nsections can be quickly ground down against the corrondum wheel. The\r\nfinal polishing of the section may be done on the lathe, or by rubbing\r\nthe flattened surface with water upon a “Water-of-Ayr” stone, and\r\nultimately set up in Canada balsam, which must not be too fluid, or it\r\nwill penetrate the _lacunæ_ and _canaliculi_, fill up the interspaces,\r\nand cause them to become quite invisible. As the flatness of the\r\npolishing surfaces is a matter of importance, the stones themselves\r\nshould be tested from time to time, and when found to present an uneven\r\nsurface must be rubbed down on a granite stone with fine sand, or on\r\na lead plate with emery powder. If it is decided to use Canada balsam\r\nas the embedding material, this must be prepared in the following\r\nmanner:--The section of tooth or bone must be attached to a slip\r\nof well-annealed glass by hardened Canada balsam, and its adhesion\r\neffectually secured by placing the slide on the cover of a water\r\nbath, or in the hot-chamber (Fig. 256), when the balsam, a thick drop\r\nof which should be used, will spread out by liquefaction. The slide\r\nshould then be removed and allowed to cool in order that the hardness\r\nof the balsam may be tested. If too soft, as indicated by its readily\r\nyielding to the pressure of the thumb-nail, the heating process must be\r\nrepeated, care being taken not to cause it to boil and form bubbles;\r\nif too hard, which will be shown by its chipping, it must be remelted\r\nand diluted with fluid balsam, and then set aside as before. When it\r\nis found to be of the right consistence, the section must be laid upon\r\nits surface with the polished side downwards; the slip of glass is\r\nnext to be gradually warmed until the balsam is softened, care being\r\ntaken to avoid the formation of bubbles, then press the section gently\r\ndown with a needle upon the liquefied balsam, the pressure being just\r\napplied on one side rather than over the whole surface, so as to drive\r\nthe superfluous balsam towards the opposite side; finally, an equable\r\npressure over the whole will secure a perfect attachment of the section\r\nwithout air bubbles. If, however, these should present themselves in\r\ndrying, and they cannot otherwise be expelled by pressure, it will\r\nbe found better to take the section off and relay it as before. The\r\nthickness of the layer of balsam may be reduced by rubbing it down\r\nbefore applying the glass-cover.\r\n\r\n_Rock Sections._--Small pieces of rock may be ground down by the aid\r\nof the lathe, or on a zinc plate, with emery powder and water, until\r\none side is rendered smooth and flat. Then fasten the polished side\r\nof the section to a square of glass on the metal holder of the lathe,\r\nwith dried Canada balsam, as directed for bone, and allow it time to\r\nbecome consolidated. When moderately thin take a piece of plate-glass\r\nand some fine emery or putty-powder and rub the section down as thin as\r\npossible. When found to be thin enough wash it well in water, and put\r\nit aside to dry, or warm it over a spirit-lamp, and with a needle push\r\nthe section off the glass into a watch-glass of benzole or turpentine,\r\nand allow it to soak until all the balsam is dissolved out. Wash\r\nagain in turpentine, and mount in Canada balsam, with or without a\r\ncover-glass. Sections of echinus spines, shells, stones of fruits, &c.,\r\nare prepared in the same way as those of bones and teeth; but when the\r\ngrinding is finished, the sections must be passed through alcohol into\r\noil of cloves, after which they should be mounted in Canada balsam. If\r\ntolerably thin, sections of these substances can be cut in the lathe;\r\nin the first instance, there will be no actual occasion to attach them\r\nto glass at all, except for the purpose of obtaining a hold upon the\r\nspecimen for polishing, but the surface thus attached must afterwards\r\nbe completely removed in order to bring into view a stratum which the\r\nCanada balsam may not have penetrated.\r\n\r\nWith regard to smaller bodies, these can scarcely be treated in any\r\nother way than by attaching a number of them to slips of glass at once,\r\nand in such a way as to make them mutually support each other. Thus in\r\nmaking horizontal and vertical sections of _foraminifera_, it would be\r\nimpossible to slice them through unless they were laid close together\r\nin a bed of hardened Canada balsam, and first grinding away one side\r\nand then turning and rubbing down the other. My friend, Dr. Wallich,\r\nmany years ago communicated to me the ingenious plan adopted by himself\r\nwhen mounting and turning a number of these minute objects together.\r\nThe specimens being cemented with Canada balsam, in the first instance,\r\nto a thin film of mica, and then attached to a glass slide by the same\r\nmeans, when ground down to the thinness desired, the slide must be\r\ngradually heated just sufficiently to allow of the detachment of the\r\nmica-film and the specimen it carries; a clean slide with a thin layer\r\nof hardened balsam having been prepared, the mica-film is transferred\r\nto it with the ground surface downward. Its adhesion by drying having\r\nbeen complete, the grinding and polishing should be proceeded with;\r\nand as the mica-film will yield to the stone without any difficulty,\r\nthe specimen now reversed in position may be further reduced to the\r\nrequisite thickness for mounting as a permanent object.\r\n\r\n_Staining and Mounting Vegetable Tissues._--Bacteria I propose to\r\ntreat of in a separate section. Vegetable tissues generally will first\r\nreceive attention, and their differentiation is based on the employment\r\nof delicate gradations of colour stains. The more striking results are\r\nobtained by _Multiple Staining_, while the cell contents are rendered\r\nmore palpable. On this account colouring media have been divided into\r\n_nuclear_, _plasmic_, and _specific_. The first are chiefly valued in\r\nproportion as they prove to have a selective affinity for the nuclei of\r\ncells, and leaving the protoplasm comparatively unstained. Such stains\r\nare needful for fresh and young tissues. On the other hand, _plasmic_\r\nstains colour tissue uniformly, and are used to give a ground colour\r\nby way of contrast; and _specific_ stains are chiefly employed to\r\ndistinguish certain elementary structures from the mass of cellulose\r\nwhich forms the basis of vegetable tissue, and which is also met with\r\nto a slight extent in animal membranes.\r\n\r\nCellulose, as it occurs in plant life, presents a variety of physical\r\nproperties: sometimes it is soft, as in young plants, and again quite\r\ndense in older structures. This fact accounts for the varying results\r\nobtained when cellulose is subjected to the action of staining fluids,\r\nand whether the cellulose occurs in a nearly pure form, as in cotton\r\nfibre, or in the modified form of lignine or woody-fibre. Stains\r\nwhich readily attack young tissue have little or no effect upon it in\r\nits maturer form. It is of much importance, then, in the staining of\r\nfibres, as well as sections for the microscope, that the cellulose\r\nshould take the stain uniformly.\r\n\r\nThe staining of tissues may be effected in four ways. First, when the\r\nstain has sufficient affinity for the tissue to be retained by it\r\nwithout the intervention of any outside agent. Second, when the stain\r\nand mordant are mixed and applied to the tissue in one solution. These\r\ntwo are the simplest and easiest methods of staining. Third, when the\r\ntissue is first immersed in the staining liquid and then transferred to\r\nsome other liquid which shall fix the colour upon the tissue. Fourth,\r\nwhen the tissue is first impregnated with the mordant, or fixing agent,\r\nand then immersed in the stain. The last method is the one usually\r\nfollowed in commercial works, and it is to be recommended in the\r\nstaining of microscopical preparations which do not readily take the\r\nstain.\r\n\r\n_Nuclear Stains._--As in both vegetable and animal sections it is\r\ngenerally the nuclei which form the landmarks of the structure, so the\r\nmost important class of reagents which are used in any of the branches\r\nof microscopical work are the “nuclear stains.” There are several of\r\nthese stains, the most important of which is the hæmatoxylin, and\r\nwhen proper solutions are used the results are very satisfactory.\r\nMany formulæ have been given, but there are three only reliable,\r\nDelafield’s, Kleinenberg’s, and Ehrlich’s, in all of which alum is\r\npresent as an ingredient; the idea being that the alumina forms with\r\nthe colouring matter an insoluble lake, and so acts as a mordant.\r\n\r\nIn _Delafield’s_ solutions a large proportion of alum to hæmatoxylin\r\nis used, and methylic alcohol (wood-spirit in the place of rectified\r\nspirit).\r\n\r\nFor _Kleinenberg’s_ solution many different formulæ exist. Squire’s\r\nimproved formulæ for both stains is given in the Appendix, “_Formulæ\r\nand Methods_.”\r\n\r\nHæmatoxylin solutions stain the nuclei violet, and in order to change\r\nthis into blue, the sections should be transferred to water taken from\r\nthe house supply, not distilled water; but as the alkalinity of the\r\nwater varies in different localities, a better and more uniform result\r\nis obtained by using a weak solution of bicarbonate of sodium (half a\r\ngrain to the ounce).\r\n\r\n_Carmine_ is also much in vogue as a nuclear stain, and the two\r\nsolutions more generally employed are Greenacher’s alcoholic borax\r\ncarmine, and Orth’s lithium carmine. Under ordinary circumstances they\r\nact as general stains, affecting the ground tissue as well as the\r\nnuclei. By subsequent treatment with acidulated alcohol or acidulated\r\nglycerine the colour is discharged from the ground tissue without\r\nseriously affecting the nuclei. Used in this way, carmine becomes a\r\ngood nuclear stain. It should be remembered that the sections must\r\nnot be washed in pure water, as the colour will to a great extent\r\nbe discharged; nor in acidulated water, as the carmine will be\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\nAlum carmine and alum cochineal are useful nuclear stains, not\r\nrequiring after-treatment.\r\n\r\n_Picro-carmines_ are also largely used. The following formulæ will be\r\nfound the most useful:--\r\n\r\n_Ammonia Picro-carmine._--Carmine, one gramme; strong solution of\r\nammonia, three cc.; distilled water, five cc. Dissolve the carmine in\r\nthe ammonia and water with a gentle heat, then add saturated aqueous\r\nsolution of picric acid, 200 cc.; heat to boiling, and filter.\r\n\r\n_Picro-Lithium Carmine._--The following is generally preferred for\r\nuse--Lithium carmine solution, 100 cc.; saturated solution of picric\r\nacid, 270 cc.\r\n\r\nThere are several aniline dyes which are used for nuclear staining:\r\nmethylene blue, methyl green, safranine, gentian violet, vesuvine,\r\nfuchsine, and Hoffmann’s blue.\r\n\r\nThe usual process is to stain in 1/4 or 1/2 per cent. aqueous solutions\r\nand wash in methylated spirit. Methylene blue and methyl green have the\r\nreputation of being so readily washed out in the methylated spirit as\r\nto be worthless. This is obviated by washing the sections (when removed\r\nfrom the stain) in distilled water, previous to the differentiation in\r\nmethylated spirit. Treated in this manner, the nuclear staining is very\r\nbeautiful. This also applies to Hoffmann’s blue and partly to vesuvine;\r\nwith the latter, however, it is not a necessity. Safranine and gentian\r\nviolet worked better by transferring the sections directly from the\r\nstain into 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Contrast Stains._--Very frequently other stains are used to dye the\r\nground a colour which is in contrast to that employed for the nuclei.\r\nBrown, orange, or pink are used after nuclear blue or green. Carmine is\r\ngenerally counterstained yellow or indigo-blue; and fuchsine red, as in\r\ntubercle bacilli, is counterstained with nuclear blue. It is important\r\nthat the ground stain should be made weaker than the principal\r\nstain, so that the whole tissue may be shown without detracting from\r\nthe nuclei. The following colours are used as counterstains for\r\nanimal sections, but they prove less useful for vegetable sections:\r\nbenzo-purpurine, eosin, erythrosine, orange, acid rubin, and picric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nExamples of _specific_ stains are fuchsine, methylene blue, and gentian\r\nviolet for bacteria; osmic acid for fatty elements; victoria blue\r\nand rose bengale, for demonstrating elastic tissue; methyl violet,\r\niodine, and safranine, for amyloid degeneration. Methylene blue is one\r\nof the most useful of aniline dyes, and one of the most variable in\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n_Iodine green_, or methyl green, has long been in use as a reagent for\r\namyloid, starchy matters, in ignorance of the fact that the reaction\r\nis due to the methyl violet, contained as an impurity in the iodine\r\ngreen. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain a green quite free from\r\nviolet. As nuclear stains they are identical, and the amyloid reaction,\r\nbeing dependent wholly upon the contained violet, varies, not with the\r\nformula of the green, but with the extent to which it has been purified.\r\n\r\n_Cellulose reactions._--After the nuclear stains, the most important\r\nreagents to the botanist are those which affect cellulose and its\r\nseveral modifications. Pure cellulose is coloured yellow by iodine,\r\nthe colour being changed to a blue on the addition of slightly dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, or a strong solution of zinc. Solutions containing\r\niodine, iodide of potassium, and chloride of zinc, give a violet\r\nreaction with unaltered cellulose, and yellow with lignine.\r\n\r\nSchulze’s zinc re-agent must be used with a certain amount of caution,\r\nas the chloride of zinc and potassium undergo decomposition. The\r\nformula now in use is as follows: Take of zinc chloride solution (sp.\r\ngr. 1·85) 70 cc., potassium iodide 10 grammes, iodine 0·1 gramme; but\r\nthis solution can only be employed as a re-agent and not as a dye, and\r\nstructures stained with it cannot be mounted in any of the ordinary\r\nmedia, and the only fluid for ringing them down is caoutchouc cement.\r\n\r\nCellulose can be stained permanently by carmine, hæmatoxylin,\r\nnigrosine, methylene blue, safranine, and fuchsine. The aniline\r\ndyes are used in dilute aqueous solutions containing one-eighth or\r\none-fourth per cent. of dye. When the cellulose undergoes the change\r\nknown as lignification its reactions are altered. It is coloured yellow\r\nby chloro-zinc iodine, red by phloroglucin, yellow by aniline chloride.\r\nThe two latter are much assisted by hydrochloric acid. The results of\r\nthese reactions also cannot be preserved in the usual mounting media.\r\n\r\nSections containing mixed tissue, partly unaltered cellulose and partly\r\nlignified, give striking results with aniline dyes, and with this\r\nadditional advantage can be preserved for years.\r\n\r\n_Double Staining._--When a section is passed through methyl green\r\nsolution and afterwards one of carmine, the lignified portion is\r\ncoloured green and the unlignified red. Acid green may be used in the\r\nplace of methyl green, with a similar result. When picric acid is used\r\nwith carmine, ingrosine, or Hoffmann’s blue, the picric acid dyes the\r\nligneous portion and the others colour the unlignified structure, red,\r\nblack, and blue respectively.\r\n\r\n_Eosin stain_ is the most useful for sieve-tubes and plates. Make a\r\nstrong solution of eosin in equal parts of water and alcohol, and stain\r\nthe section for five or ten minutes. Wash well in methylated spirit,\r\ndehydrate, clean in oil of cloves, and mount in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching Process._--The bleaching and clearing of vegetable\r\nstructures before staining is a very necessary process, especially\r\nso if starch be present in any quantity. Clearing agents are of\r\ntwo kinds--those which act by virtue of their property of strongly\r\nrefracting light, and those which disintegrate and dissolve the amyloid\r\ncell contents. To the first class belong the essential oils, as oil\r\nof cloves, Canada balsam, glycerine, and other similar bodies; to the\r\nsecond class, solutions of potash, phenol, and chloral hydrate. The\r\nactual value of some of these agents is questionable. The process\r\nusually preferred is as follows: Place the sections in a fresh clear\r\nsolution of chlorinated lime, allowing them to remain until quite\r\nbleached, say from two to four or five minutes; then gently warm in\r\na test-tube for a few seconds, and quickly replace the solution with\r\ndistilled water and boil for two or three minutes; repeat the treatment\r\nwith boiling water three times; wash with a one per cent. solution of\r\nacetic acid, and finally with distilled water. The sections are then\r\nquite ready for staining operations.\r\n\r\nWhen the stem is hard and brown, a solution of chloride of lime should\r\nbe used--a quarter of an ounce of chloride dissolved in a pint of\r\nwater, well shaken and stood by to settle down, then pour off the clear\r\nfluid for use. For hard tissues this solution answers well, but it is\r\nnot suitable for leaves, as they require not only bleaching, but the\r\ncell contents should be dissolved out to render them transparent. A\r\nsolution of chlorinated soda answers well for both stems and leaves. It\r\nis prepared as follows:--\r\n\r\nTo one pint of water add two ounces of fresh chloride of lime, shake\r\nor stir it well two or three times, then allow it to stand till the\r\nlime has settled. Prepare meanwhile a saturated solution of carbonate\r\nof soda--common washing soda. Now pour off the clear supernatant\r\nfluid from the chloride of lime, and add to it, by degrees, the soda\r\nsolution, when a precipitate of carbonate of lime will be thrown down;\r\ncontinue to add the soda solution till no further precipitate is\r\nformed. Filter the solution, and keep it in a well-stoppered bottle in\r\nthe dark, otherwise it speedily spoils.\r\n\r\nSections bleached in chlorinated soda must, when white enough, be\r\nwashed in distilled water, and allowed to remain in it for twenty-four\r\nhours, changing the water four or five times, and adding a few drops\r\nof nitric acid, or at the rate of eight or ten drops to the half-pint,\r\nto the water employed before the final washing takes place. From water\r\ntransfer them to alcohol, in which they must remain for an hour or more.\r\n\r\nAlthough alkaline glycerine has been recommended for several purposes\r\nin micro-technique, it is not so well known as it should be how\r\nserviceable it is as an extempore mounting solution in vegetable\r\nhistology. The best mixture for general use is composed of glycerine 2\r\nozs., distilled water 1-1/2 oz., solution of potash, B.P., 1/2 oz. This\r\ncombines the refringent property of the glycerine with the clearing\r\naction of the caustic potash, while the swelling action of the potash\r\nis considerably diminished.\r\n\r\n_Cutting Sections of Hard Woods._--The lathe and circular saw will be\r\nfound as useful for cutting sections of the harder kinds of woods,\r\nas for bone structure. It may be necessary to subject the older and\r\nconsequently harder pieces of wood to the action of steam for a few\r\nhours to soften them, and afterwards transfer them to methylated\r\nspirit, before making an attempt to cut sections. But the more open\r\nwoods, of one, two, or three years’ growth, will show all that may\r\nbe required, and these can be cut by hand, or with the microtome, as\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice the finest and thinnest possible slices may be\r\ncut by hand. It is usual to take off the first slice to give a smooth\r\nand even surface to the specimen. Then turn the screw to raise it a\r\nlittle, sprinkle the surface with spirit and water, and cut with a\r\nlight hand. Remove the cut sections with a fine camel’s-hair brush\r\nor a section lifter (Fig. 250) to a small vessel containing water,\r\nwhen the thinnest will float on the surface, and remove to methylated\r\nspirit and water, where they should remain until they can be mounted.\r\nSections of hard woods, and those containing gum-resins, or other\r\ninsoluble material, must first be kept in methylated spirit or alcohol,\r\nand finally transferred to oil of cloves, to render them sufficiently\r\ntransparent for mounting in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nIf the structure of an exogenous wood is required to be examined,\r\nthe sections should be made in at least three different ways: the\r\ntransverse, the longitudinal, and the oblique, or, as they are\r\nsometimes called, the horizontal, vertical, and tangential, each of\r\nwhich will exhibit different appearances, as seen in Fig. 245: _b_ is a\r\nvertical section through the pith of a coniferous plant, and exhibits\r\nthe medullary rays known to the cabinet-maker as the silver grain;\r\n_e_ is a magnified view of a part of the same; the woody fibres are\r\nseen with their dots _l_, and the horizontal lines _k_ indicating the\r\nmedullary rays cut lengthwise; _c_ is a tangential section, and _f_ a\r\nportion of the same; the medullary rays _m m_, and the woody fibres\r\nwith vertical slices of the dots, are shown. Instructive preparations\r\nwill be secured by cutting oblique sections of the stem. The sections\r\nseen are made from the pine. All exogenous stems, however, exhibit\r\nthree different appearances, according to the direction in which the\r\nsection is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.--Sections of Wood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteria Cultivation, Sterilising, and Preparing for Microscopical\r\nExamination.\r\n\r\nThat branch of mycology which is now looked upon as a separate\r\ndepartment of science, termed bacteriology, took shape in the years\r\n1875-9, when its founder, the veteran botanist Cohn, who recognised\r\nthat the protoplasm of plants corresponded to the animal sarcode,\r\npublished his exact mode of studying bacteria. But it was a pupil\r\nof his, Dr. Koch, who a year later discovered that a specific cattle\r\ndisease, anthrax, was due to a bacillus, and it was he also who gave\r\nus the useful modification of gelatine as a medium in which to grow\r\nbacteria; he hit upon the method of pouring melted gelatine containing\r\ndistributed germs on to plates, and thus isolating the colonies and\r\nensuring the further isolation of the spores, and so facilitate the\r\npreparation of pure cultures on a large scale, and with great saving of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of isolating a bacterium and tracing its life history\r\nunder the microscope must at first sight appear great. A further\r\nobjection that such work is slow and difficult has no more weight here\r\nthan in any other department of science, as will be seen on proceeding\r\nto follow out the directions I am about to furnish for the use of the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus, Material, and Reagents employed in Bacteriological\r\nInvestigations.\r\n\r\nA good microscope with a wide-angled sub-stage condenser, and\r\nobjectives of an inch, 1/4-inch, or 1/6-inch, and a 1/12-inch\r\nhomogeneous oil-immersion.\r\n\r\nA large bell-glass for covering the same when fuming acids are in use\r\nin the laboratory.\r\n\r\nAbout a square foot of blackened plate-glass.\r\n\r\nA white porcelain slab, or a shallow photographic dish of some size.\r\n\r\nGlass bottles with ground stoppers for alcoholic solutions and aniline\r\ndyes.\r\n\r\nGlass bottles with funnels for filtering solutions of stains, with\r\npipettes.\r\n\r\nA specialised form of pipette for the micro-chemical filtration of\r\nsolutions (Fig. 246).\r\n\r\nA small stoppered bottle of cedar oil (Fig. 247).\r\n\r\nSet of small glass dishes or watch-glasses for section staining.\r\n\r\nStock of glass slides sterilised, together with round thin\r\nglass-covers, in boxes (Fig. 248).\r\n\r\nNeedle holders and platinum needles, with a packet of ordinary sewing\r\nneedles (Fig. 249).\r\n\r\nPlatinum, or plated copper section-lifters (Fig. 250).\r\n\r\nGlass rods, drawn out to a fine point, for manipulating sections when\r\nacids are employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--Bottle and Dipper for Cedar Oil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Pipette for Micro-chemical Filtration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--Box for keeping Glass-covers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--Needle Holders, fine Lifter and Hook for\r\nManipulating Structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--Section Lifters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--Spring Flat Forceps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251_a_.--Forceps with fine Points.]\r\n\r\nA pair of small spring steel platinum-pointed forceps for holding\r\nglass-covers (Fig. 251).\r\n\r\nOne or two pairs of fine-pointed forceps (Fig. 251_a_).\r\n\r\nCollapsible tubes for containing Canada balsam and dammar.\r\n\r\nSoft rags or old pocket handkerchiefs for removing cedar oil from\r\nlenses and cover-glasses. Chamois leather for wiping lenses and\r\nremoving dust.\r\n\r\n_Reagents_, _alcohol_, bergamot oil, _celloidin_, dissolved in equal\r\nparts of ether and alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Ebner’s_ solution. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\n_Formalin_, glycerine, gelatine, _Klebs’_ and _Kleinenberg’s_\r\nsolutions. (See Appendix.) The latter consisting of a watery solution\r\nof picric acid 100 parts; strong sulphuric acid two parts; filter, and\r\nadd distilled water 300 parts.\r\n\r\n_Muller_ fluid. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\n_Osmic acid_, a five per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n_Paraffin_, _spermaceti_ and _xylol_, _acetic acid_, _hydrochloric\r\nacid_, a one per cent. solution with _alcohol_.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia_ liquid, _ether_, _picro-lithium carmine_, _potash solution_.\r\n\r\n_Safranine_, concentrated alcoholic solution of, and a watery solution.\r\n\r\n_Turpentine_, _vesuvin_, water distilled and sterilised.\r\n\r\nAqueous solutions of the several dyes may be kept in bottles ready for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nTo both aqueous and alcoholic solutions a few drops of phenol, or a\r\ncrystal of thymol, should be added as a preservative. For the rapid\r\nstaining of cover-glass preparations, it is convenient to have the\r\nmost frequently used stains--fuchsine, methyl-violet, &c.--in bottles\r\nprovided with pipette stoppers.\r\n\r\n_Clearing Agents._--Oils of cedar wood, cloves, origanum, aniline,\r\nterebene, toluol and xylol, benzol and spirits of turpentine.\r\n\r\n_Mounting Media._--Acetate of potash solution concentrated, benzole,\r\nbalsam, glycerine jelly, Fanant’s medium, dammar and mastic, Canada\r\nbalsam in xylol, Hollis’s glue, zinc white.\r\n\r\nCement for fixing small specimens temporarily to a glass slide. Remove\r\nall traces of moisture, place upon it a drop or two of a medium\r\nprepared as follows:--Dissolve over a water bath 15 grammes of white\r\nlac in 100 grammes of absolute alcohol, decant off the clear liquid,\r\nand stand it by for a while.\r\n\r\nAs the alcohol evaporates from the warmed surface of the glass slide a\r\nhard transparent coating is left. This may be slightly softened at any\r\ntime by means of a drop of oil of lavender. After arranging the objects\r\nthe heat of a spirit-lamp will cause the oil to evaporate, leaving\r\nthem firmly attached. Objects may be mounted on cover-glasses in a\r\nsimilar way. A resinous mounting medium may then be employed in the\r\nusual manner. If glycerine or glycerine jelly is the mounting medium\r\nemployed, collodion diluted with two or three times its volume of oil\r\nof lavender may be found preferable as the fixing agent. The section\r\nshould be placed in position before the preparation dries and the oil\r\nis evaporated.\r\n\r\nMethylated spirit is often so largely adulterated with rock-oil as\r\nto render it unsuitable for technical purposes. Even to varnishes it\r\nimparts a fluorescent appearance as it dries off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.--Iron Box for holding Sterilised Instruments\r\nand Glass Plates.]\r\n\r\nThe needles and instruments used must not be passed through a Bunsen\r\nburner flame, which is most destructive, but enclosed in a sheet-iron\r\nbox made for the purpose (Fig. 252), and placed in the hot-air\r\nsteriliser for an hour at 150°C. The box can be opened at the side,\r\nand each instrument withdrawn with a pair of sterilised forceps when\r\nrequired for use.\r\n\r\n_Glass plates_ are sterilised in the same iron box, and the _platinum\r\nneedles_ for inoculating nutrient media, examining cultivations, &c.,\r\nare served in the same manner before being used. The needles consist\r\nof two or three inches of platinum wire fixed to the end of a glass\r\nrod. Several of these needles should be made by fixing pieces of wire\r\ninto a glass rod about six inches long. The glass rod must be heated at\r\nthe extreme end in the flame of a Bunsen burner, or blow-pipe, and the\r\nplatinum wire held near one extremity with forceps, and fused into the\r\nend of the glass rod. Some of these rods should be straight, and some\r\nbent, and others provided with a loop, and kept especially ready for\r\ninoculating test-tubes of nutrient jelly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.--Damp Chamber for Plate-cultivations.]\r\n\r\n_Glass Dishes._--Several shallow glass dishes are required for\r\npreparing damp chamber cultivations, the upper covers fitting over\r\nthe under (as in Fig. 253), in the centre of which culture-plates are\r\nstacked one above the other, and when necessary placed in the incubator.\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus for Incubation and Cultivations in Liquid Media.\r\n\r\n_Lister’s Flasks._--Lister devised a globe-shaped flask with two\r\nnecks, a vertical and a lateral one, the lateral being a bent spout,\r\ntapering towards the extremity. When the vessel is restored to the\r\nerect position after pouring out some of its contents, a drop of\r\nliquid remains behind in the end of the nozzle, and thus prevents the\r\nregurgitation of air through the spout. A cap of cotton-wool is tied\r\nover the orifice, and the residue left in the flask for future use. The\r\nvertical neck of the flask is plugged with sterilised cotton-wool in\r\nthe ordinary way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--Pasteur’s Bulb Pipette.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--Storing Cultivation Tube.]\r\n\r\nSternberg advocates the use of a glass bulb, provided with a slender\r\nneck drawn out to a fine point and hermetically sealed. Special forms\r\nof tubes, bulbs, and pipettes were devised by Pasteur, and are still\r\nin use at the Bacteriological Institute, Paris, and known as the\r\nPasteur’s bulb pipette (Fig. 254).\r\n\r\nOthers are provided with lateral or with curved arms, one of which\r\nis drawn out to a fine point, and the slender neck plugged with\r\ncotton-wool, as in Fig. 255.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARM CHAMBER, STERILISER, AND INCUBATOR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.--Pfeiffer’s Warm Chamber.]\r\n\r\n_The Warm Chamber._--This is an accessory of importance in\r\nbacteriological work. For the continuous heating of specimens during\r\ncultivation it is an absolute necessity. Pfeiffer’s warm chamber (Fig.\r\n256) is suitable for microscopical work generally. It consists of a\r\nhard-wood box, made air-tight, with doors and glass windows to allow\r\nof the specimen being moved from time to time, and kept under constant\r\nobservation. The box is mounted on a metal plate tripod stand, and is\r\nheated from below by a small gas burner, with a thermo-regulator. A\r\nparaffin lamp will do as well, so long as it maintains a temperature of\r\nfrom 25° to 45°C., and without danger of injury to the stand and lenses\r\nof the microscope. A thermometer is placed in the air space to mark the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.--Crookshank’s Incubator.]\r\n\r\n_Hot-air Incubators and Sterilisers_ are usually made of sheet-iron,\r\nin the form of a cubical chest, with double walls, supported on four\r\nlegs, as that of Dr. Crookshank’s (Fig. 257). They are heated by gas or\r\na lamp from below, while the temperature is indicated by a thermometer\r\ninserted through a hole in the top, as in that of the Hearson’s\r\nincubator. Test-tubes, flasks, funnels, cotton-wool, &c., must be\r\nsterilised by exposure to a temperature of 150°C. for an hour or more.\r\n\r\n_Wire Cages_ or crates are used for containing test-tubes, especially\r\nwhen they are to be sterilised in the hot-air steriliser, or for\r\nlowering tubes of nutrient jelly into the steam steriliser. All\r\ninstruments, needles, scalpels, &c., before using must be carefully\r\nsterilised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.--Dr. Koch’s Steam Steriliser.]\r\n\r\n_Steam Sterilisers_ are made either of iron or tin, jacketed with thick\r\nfelt, and provided with a conical cap or lid perforated at the apex to\r\nreceive a thermometer (Fig. 258). Inside the vessel is an iron grating\r\nor diaphragm about two-thirds of the way down, which divides the\r\ninterior into two chambers, the upper or steam chamber, and the lower\r\nor water chamber. A gauge outside marks the level of the water in the\r\nlower chamber; this should be kept about two-thirds full. The apparatus\r\nstands upon three legs, and is heated from below with a Bunsen burner\r\nor a lamp. It is employed for sterilising nutrient media in tubes or\r\nflasks, for cooking potatoes or hastening the filtration of agar-agar.\r\nWhen the thermometer indicates 100° C. the lid is removed, and\r\ntest-tubes are lowered in a wire-basket by means of a hook and string,\r\nand the lid quickly replaced. Potatoes or small flasks are lowered into\r\nthe cylinder in a tin receiver with a perforated bottom, which rests\r\nupon the grating, and admits of the contents being exposed to the steam\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nOne of the most efficient forms of incubators introduced into the\r\nbacteriological laboratory is that known as Hearson’s (Fig. 259).\r\nThis consists of a chamber surrounded by a water-jacket, with water\r\nspace below, to afford room for the pipe, L, which conveys the heated\r\nproducts from the flame of the lamp, T, through the water and back\r\nagain to the lantern. A is the water-jacket surrounding the chamber\r\ncontaining the cultures; O, the pipe through which the water supply is\r\nadmitted; N, the tap for employing the same; M, the overflow pipe; S,\r\nthe capsule in a case attached by a tube to the lower plate outside;\r\nD, a lever pivoted on the left, carrying at its free end a damper, F,\r\nwhich, when resting on the chimney, V, effectually closes it; P, a\r\nscrew for adjusting the damper when starting the apparatus; H, a lead\r\nweight for bringing more pressure on the capsule; K, a thermometer, the\r\nbulb of which is inside and the scale outside the chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.--The Baird-Hearson Biological Incubator.]\r\n\r\nThe treated products of combustion move in the direction indicated\r\nuntil the water and chamber are sufficiently heated to distend the\r\ncapsule. When this point is reached the wire between S and P is pushed\r\nup by the capsule, and the lever causes the damper to rise more or\r\nless off the chimney, V, and on examining the thermometer the inside\r\nof the chamber is at length found to remain steadily at the required\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nWhen the thermometer registers the desired temperature, the lead\r\nweight must be damped to the lever by means of the milled-head screw\r\nwhich goes through it. After having been once adjusted the heat in\r\nthe interior will remain constant, notwithstanding the utmost changes\r\nof temperature occurring in these latitudes, nor will very great\r\nalterations in the size of the lamp-flame seriously interfere with the\r\nresults. The milled-head screw, P, must be turned, after the first\r\nadjustment, during the whole time that the incubator is in use. Observe\r\nthe temperature before opening the door; observations taken afterwards\r\nare worthless.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation of Nutrient Media--Separation, and Cultivation of Bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.--Plate Cultivation Showing Colonies.]\r\n\r\nTo cultivate micro-organisms artificially they must be supplied\r\nwith the proper nutrient material, perfectly free from pre-existing\r\norganisms. The secret of Koch’s methods greatly depends upon the\r\npossibility, in the case of starting with a mixture of micro-organisms,\r\nof being able to isolate them completely one from another, and to\r\nobtain an absolutely pure growth of each cultivable species. When\r\nsterile nutrient gelatine has been liquefied in a test-tube and\r\ninoculated with a mixture of bacteria in such a way that the individual\r\nmicro-organisms are distributed throughout it, and the liquid is poured\r\nout on a glass plate and allowed to solidify, the individual bacteria,\r\ninstead of moving about freely as in a liquid medium, are fixed to\r\none spot, where they develop their own species. In this way colonies\r\nare formed, each possessing its own biological characteristics and\r\nmorphological appearances (Fig. 260).\r\n\r\nTo maintain individuals isolated from each other during growth,\r\nand free from contamination, it is only necessary to thin out the\r\ncultivation to protect the plates from the air, and to have facilities\r\nfor examining them from time to time, and observing the characteristic\r\nmicroscopical appearances. The colonies on nutrient gelatine examined\r\nwith a low power (Fig. 260), if micro-organisms such as _Bacillus\r\nanthraces_ and _Proteus mirabilis_, the naked eye appearances in\r\ntest-tubes of the growth of the bacilli of anthrax and tubercle, and\r\nthe brilliant growth of micro-coccus prodigiosus, may be given as\r\nexamples in which the appearances are often very striking and sometimes\r\nquite characteristic. I must, however, first direct attention to a\r\nwell-recognised fact, that bacteriology only touches animal pathology\r\nat a few points, and that so far from bacteria being synonymous with\r\n_disease germs_, the majority of these remarkable organisms appear\r\nto be beneficent rather than inimical to man. This is of immense\r\nimportance to science, as I shall attempt to show further on; although\r\neven a brief description of all the useful ferments due to bacteria and\r\nbrought into use would occupy a volume to themselves, and call for a\r\nschool of bacteriology quite apart from that involved in the medical\r\naspect of the question, for the purpose of fully investigating problems\r\nraised by the agriculturist, the forester, the gardener, the dairyman,\r\nbrewer, dyer, tanner, and other industries, which open up vistas of\r\npractical application, and to some extent are already being taken\r\nadvantage of in commerce.\r\n\r\n_The Preparation of Nutrient Gelatine and Agar-agar._--Take half a\r\nkilogramme (one pound) of beef as free as possible from fat, chop\r\nfinely, transfer to a flask or cylindrical vessel, and shake up well\r\nwith a litre of distilled water. Place the vessel in an ice-pail, or\r\nice-cupboard, or in winter in a cold cellar, and leave for the night.\r\nNext morning commence with the preparation of all requisite apparatus.\r\nThoroughly wash and rinse with alcohol about 100 test-tubes, and allow\r\nthem to dry. Plug the mouths of the test-tubes with cotton-wool, place\r\nthem in their wire cages in the hot-air steriliser, to be heated for\r\nan hour at a temperature of 150°C. In the same manner cleanse and\r\nsterilise several flasks, and a small glass funnel. In the meantime,\r\nthe meat infusion must be well shaken, and the liquid portion separated\r\nby filtering and squeezing through a linen cloth or a meat press. The\r\nred juice thus obtained must be brought up to a litre by transferring\r\nit to a large measuring glass and adding distilled water. It is then\r\npoured into a sufficiently large and strong beaker, and set aside after\r\nthe addition of ten grammes of peptone, five grammes of common salt,\r\nand 100 grammes of best gelatine.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour the gelatine is sufficiently softened, and\r\nsubsequent heating in a water bath causes it to be completely dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe next process requires the greatest care and attention. Some\r\nmicro-organisms grow best in a slightly acid, others in a slightly\r\nalkaline, medium. For example, for the growth and characteristic\r\nappearances of the _comma bacillus_ of Asiatic cholera a faintly\r\nalkaline soil is absolutely essential. This slightly alkaline medium\r\nwill be found to answer best for most micro-organisms, and may be\r\nobtained as follows:--With a clean glass rod dipped in the mixture, the\r\nreaction upon litmus-paper may be obtained, and a concentrated solution\r\nof carbonate of soda must be added drop by drop until red litmus-paper\r\nbecomes faintly blue. If it is too alkaline, it can be neutralised by\r\nthe addition of lactic acid.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mixture is heated for an hour in the water-bath. Ten\r\nminutes before the boiling is completed the white of an egg beaten up\r\nwith the shell is added, and the liquid is then filtered while hot.\r\n\r\nDuring filtration the funnel should be covered over with a plate of\r\nglass, and the process of filtering must be repeated, if necessary,\r\nuntil a pale straw-coloured, perfectly transparent filtrate results.\r\nThe sterilised test-tubes are filled to about a third of their depth\r\nby pouring in the gelatine carefully and steadily. The object of this\r\ncare is to prevent the mixture touching the part of the tube with which\r\nthe plug comes into contact; otherwise, when the gelatine sets, the\r\ncotton-wool adheres to the tubes and becomes a source of embarrassment\r\nto subsequent procedures. As the tubes are filled they are placed\r\nin a basket, and then sterilised. They are either lowered into the\r\nsteam steriliser, when the thermometer indicates 100 cc., for twelve\r\nminutes, for four or five successive days, or they may be transferred\r\nto the test-tube water-bath, and heated for an hour or two for three\r\nsuccessive days.\r\n\r\nIf the gelatine shows any turbidity after, it must be poured back into\r\na flask, boiled for ten minutes, and filtered again, and the process of\r\nsterilisation repeated.\r\n\r\n_Nutrient Agar-agar_ is a substance prepared from seaweed which grows\r\non the coasts of Japan and India, and is supplied in long crinkled\r\nstrips. It boils at 90° C., and remains solid up to a temperature\r\nof about 45° C. It is therefore substituted for gelatine in the\r\npreparation of a jelly for the cultivation of those bacteria which\r\nwill grow best in the incubator at the temperature of the blood, and\r\nalso at ordinary temperature for bacteria which lignify gelatine. The\r\npreparation is conducted on much the same principles as those already\r\ndescribed. Instead, however, of 100 grammes of gelatine, only about\r\ntwenty grammes of agar-agar (1·5 to 2 per cent.), and to facilitate the\r\nsolution it must be allowed to soak in salt water overnight. Flannel\r\nis substituted for filter paper. The hot-water apparatus is invariably\r\nemployed. The final results, when solid, should be colourless and\r\nclear; but if slightly milky, it may still be employed.\r\n\r\n_Wort-gelatine_ is used in studying the bacteria of fermentation. It is\r\nmade by adding from five to ten per cent. of gelatine to beer-wort.\r\n\r\n_Glycerine Agar-agar._--This is made by adding five per cent. of\r\nglycerine to nutrient agar-agar, after the boiling and before the\r\nfiltration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     1       2       3      4        5       6\r\n  Yellow. Yellow.   Red.  Orange.  Green.  Brown.\r\n\r\nFig. 261.--Pure Cultivation in Tubes (Crookshank).]\r\n\r\n_Test-tube Cultivations._--To inoculate test-tubes containing nutrient\r\njelly, the cotton-wool plug is removed. A sterilised needle, charged,\r\nfor example, with blood or pus containing bacteria, is thrust once in\r\nthe middle line into the nutrient jelly, and steadily withdrawn. The\r\ntube should be held horizontally or with its mouth downwards, and the\r\nplug replaced as quickly as possible, and an india-rubber cap fitted\r\nover the mouth of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe appearance produced by the growths in the test-tubes can be in\r\nmost cases sufficiently examined with the naked eye (Fig. 261). In\r\nsome cases the jelly is partially liquefied, while in others it\r\nremains solid. The growths may be abundant or scanty, coloured or\r\ncolourless. When liquefaction slowly takes place in the needle tracts,\r\nthe appearances which result are often very delicate and in some very\r\ncharacteristic. The appearance of a simple white thread with branching\r\nlateral filaments, of a cloudiness, or of a string of beads in the\r\ntrack of the needle, may be given as examples. In some cases much may\r\nbe learnt by means of a magnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nBeneke recommends that gelatine culture tubes should be inoculated by\r\nmaking a puncture quite at the side of the medium, close to the glass.\r\nThe advantage of this method over the plan of inoculating the mass in\r\nthe middle is that the growing culture can be microscopically examined\r\nfrom the outside, and various details made out, such as the nature of\r\nthe growth, the comparative appearance of colonies near the surface and\r\nthose situated more deeply, and the presence of one or more distinct\r\norganisms. If the tubes used have the opposite sides flat and parallel,\r\nsuch examinations will be still further facilitated.\r\n\r\n_Plate Cultivations._--By this method a mixture of bacteria, whether\r\nin fluids, excreta, or in cultivations on solid media, can be so\r\ntreated that the different species are isolated one from the other, and\r\nperfectly pure cultivations of each of the cultivable bacteria in the\r\noriginal mixture established in various nutrient media. We are enabled\r\nalso to examine under a low power of the microscope the individual\r\ncolonies of bacteria. The same process, with slight modification, is\r\nalso employed in the examination of air, soil, and water.\r\n\r\nIn order to spread out the liquid jelly evenly on the surface of a\r\nglass plate, and to hasten its solidification, it is necessary to\r\nplace the plate upon a level and cool surface. The glass plates are\r\nsterilised in an iron box placed in the hot-air steriliser, at 150° C.,\r\nfrom one to two hours.\r\n\r\nThe damp chambers for the reception of the inoculated plates are\r\nprepared by cleansing and washing out with one in twenty carbolic\r\nacid the shallow glass dish and bell-cover (Fig. 253). A piece of\r\nfilter-paper should cover the bottom of dish, moistened with the same\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n“In a glass-beaker with pad of cotton-wool at bottom place tube\r\ncontaining cultivation, the three tubes to be inoculated, three glass\r\nrods which have to be sterilised, and a thermometer. Liquefy the\r\ngelatine in the three tubes by placing them in a beaker containing\r\nwater 30° C. Keep the tubes, both before and after the inoculation, in\r\nthe warm water to maintain the gelatine in a state of liquefaction.\r\nRemove the plug from the culture and also the plug of test-tube with\r\nliquefied jelly. With the needle take up a droplet of the cultivation\r\nand stir it round in the liquefied jelly. Replace both plugs, and\r\nset aside the cultivation. Hold the freshly-inoculated tube almost\r\nhorizontally, then raise it to the vertical, so that the liquid\r\ngelatine gently flows back. By repeating this motion, and rolling the\r\ntube, the micro-organisms which have been introduced are distributed\r\nthroughout the gelatine. Any violent shaking, and consequent formation\r\nof bubbles, must be carefully avoided. Inoculate the second tube, and\r\nalso third, in the same way, but with three droplets from a sterilised\r\nneedle. The next process consists in pouring out the gelatine on glass\r\nplates and allowing it to solidify.\r\n\r\n“Remove cover of box containing sterilised plates, withdraw a plate\r\nwith sterilised forceps, and rapidly transfer it to the filter-paper\r\nunder the bell-glass and quickly replace cover of box. Remove plug from\r\nthe test-tube which was first inoculated, and the contents are poured\r\nout on the plate. With a glass rod the gelatine must be then rapidly\r\nspread out in an even layer within about half an inch of the margin of\r\nthe plate, the bell-glass is replaced, and the gelatine is allowed to\r\nset. Meanwhile a glass bench is placed in damp chamber, upon which the\r\nplate is placed when the gelatine is quite solid; precisely the same\r\nprocess is repeated with the other tubes.\r\n\r\n“The colonies will be found to develop in the course of a day or two,\r\nthe time varying with the temperature of the room. The lower plate will\r\ncontain a countless number of colonies, which, if the micro-organisms\r\nliquefy gelatine, speedily commingle, and produce in a very short time\r\na complete liquefaction of the whole gelatine. On the middle plate\r\nthe colonies will also be very numerous, but retain their isolated\r\npositions for a longer time; while on the uppermost plate the colonies\r\nare completely isolated from one another, with an appreciable surface\r\nof gelatine intervening.\r\n\r\n“The microscopical appearances of the colonies are best studied by\r\nplacing the plate on a slab of blackened glass, or on a porcelain\r\nslab if the colonies are coloured. A small diaphragm is used, and\r\nthe appearances studied principally with a low power. A much simpler\r\nmethod of plate-cultivation is to pour the liquefied jelly into shallow\r\nflat dishes; they take up much less room, and in many ways are more\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n“Nutrient agar-agar can also be employed for the preparation\r\nof plate-cultivations, but it is much more difficult to obtain\r\nsatisfactory results.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopical Examination of Bacteria.\r\n\r\n_Bacteria in Liquids, Cultures, and Fresh Tissues._--In conducting\r\nbacteriological researches, the importance of absolute cleanliness\r\ncannot be too strongly insisted upon. All instruments, glass vessels,\r\nslides, and cover-glasses should be thoroughly cleansed before use. The\r\nsame applies to the preparation and employment of culture media; any\r\nlaxity in the processes of sterilisation, or insufficient attention to\r\nminute technical details, will be followed with disappointing results\r\nby contamination of the cultures, resulting in the loss of much time.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of microscopical specimens it will be found\r\nconvenient to use a platinum inoculating needle, sterilised, as\r\nbefore directed, in the sheet-iron box; in a few moments it will be\r\ncool enough not to destroy the bacteria with which it is brought into\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n_Unstained Bacteria._--The bacteria in liquids, such as blood and\r\nculture-fluids, can be investigated in the unstained condition by\r\ntransferring a drop with a looped platinum needle, or a capillary\r\npipette, to a slide, covering it with a clean cover-glass, and\r\nexamining without further treatment. If it is desirable to keep the\r\nspecimen under prolonged observation, a drop of sterilised water or\r\nsalt solution must be run in at the margin of the cover-glass to\r\ncounteract the tendency to dry.\r\n\r\nCultures on the solid media can be examined by transferring a small\r\nportion with a sterilised needle to a drop of sterilised water on\r\na slide, thinning it out, and covering with cover-glass as already\r\ndescribed. Tissues in the fresh state may be teased out with needles\r\n(Fig. 249) in sterilised salt solution, and pressed out into a\r\nsufficiently thin layer between the slide and cover-glass. Glycerine\r\nmay in many cases be substituted for salt solution, especially for such\r\nas actinomyces and mould fungi.\r\n\r\nVery small bacilli and micro-cocci are distinguished from granular\r\nmatter or fat-crystals, or _vice versâ_, by the fact that the latter\r\nare altered or dispersed by the addition of acetic acid, and changed\r\nby solution of potash; ether dissolves out fatty particles, while\r\nmicro-organisms remain unaffected. Baumgarten demonstrated tubercle\r\nbacilli in sections by treating them with potash, which clarified\r\nthe tissues and brought the bacilli clearly into view. In examining\r\nunstained bacteria the iris-diaphragm should be used, and the sub-stage\r\ncondenser carefully centred and focussed.\r\n\r\nHis’s Method of Staining.--A slide is prepared as for bacteria in the\r\nfresh state; the reagents are then applied by placing them with a\r\npipette drop by drop at a margin of the cover-glass, and causing them\r\nto flow through the preparation by means of a strip of filter-paper\r\nplaced at the opposite margin.\r\n\r\nBabès’ Method is as follows: A little of the growth spread out on a\r\ncover-glass into as thin a film as possible; when almost dry, apply a\r\ndrop or two of a weak aqueous solution of methyl-violet from a pipette\r\nto the film; any excess of the stain must be removed by gentle pressure\r\nwith a strip of filter-paper.\r\n\r\n_Cover-glass Preparations._--A cover-glass is smeared with the\r\nsubstance to be examined spread out into a sufficiently thin layer; in\r\nthe case of cultures on solid media, diffuse the bacteria in a little\r\nsterilised water. By means of another cover-glass the juice or fluid is\r\nsqueezed out from between them into a thin layer, and on sliding them\r\napart each cover-glass bears on it a thin film of the material. The\r\ncover-glass is then placed with its film side upwards and allowed to\r\ndry. After a few minutes it is passed from above downwards through the\r\nflame of a Bunsen burner three times. Apply two or three drops of an\r\naqueous solution of fuchsine or methyl-violet to cover the film, wash\r\naway any surplus stain after a few minutes with distilled water. The\r\ncover-glass is then allowed to dry, when the preparation may be mounted\r\nin Canada balsam, or while still wet, turned over on a slide, and the\r\nexcess of water removed with filter-paper.\r\n\r\nIf necessary to apply stain for a much larger period, pour staining\r\nsolution into a watch glass and allow cover-glass to swim on surface\r\nwith prepared side downwards.\r\n\r\nCrookshank, instead of watery solutions of aniline dyes, prefers to use\r\nstronger solutions, and to reduce the staining by a momentary immersion\r\nin alcohol. The method is as follows: cover-glass preparations are\r\nstained with carbolised fuchsine (_Neelsen’s solution_) for about two\r\nminutes, rinsed in alcohol for a few seconds, and quickly washed in\r\nwater. This method is specially valuable for sarcinæ and streptococci.\r\n\r\n_Gram’s Method._--The whole film is first stained violet with\r\ngentian-violet, fixed by a solution of iodine, in iodide of potassium\r\nin the bacilli, but not in any débris, pus cells, or tissue elements\r\npresent. Transfer cover-glass to alcohol, the bacilli alone remain\r\nstained, the violet colour being changed to blue. By employing a\r\ncontrast colour, such as eosin, a double staining is obtained.\r\n\r\nFor staining preparations with gentian-violet Crookshank employs the\r\nfollowing useful method:--Place four or five drops of pure aniline in a\r\ntest-tube, add distilled water to three-quarters full, close mouth with\r\nthumb, shake thoroughly. Filter the emulsion twice, pour filtrate into\r\nwatch-glass. To the perfectly clear aniline water thus obtained, add,\r\ndrop by drop, a concentrated alcoholic solution of gentian-violet till\r\nprecipitation commences. Cover-glasses must be left in this solution\r\nten minutes, transferred to iodine-potassic-iodide until the film\r\nbecomes uniformly brown, then rinsed in alcohol. The decolourisation\r\nmay be hastened by dipping the cover-glass in clove oil and returning\r\nto alcohol. Again immerse cover-glass in clove oil, dry by gently\r\npressing between two layers of filter-paper, and mount in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n_Double-staining_ of cover-glass preparations.--They can be treated\r\nby Ehrlich’s method for staining tubercular sputum, or by Neelsen’s\r\nmodification, or by staining with eosin after treatment by the method\r\nof Gram.\r\n\r\nEhrlich’s Method is as follows: Five parts of aniline oil are shaken\r\nup with one hundred parts of distilled water, and the emulsion filtered\r\nthrough moistened filter-paper. A saturated alcoholic solution of\r\nfuchsine, methyl-violet, or gentian-violet, is added to filtrate in\r\nwatch-glass, drop by drop, until precipitation commences. Cover-glass\r\npreparations are floated in this mixture for fifteen minutes to half an\r\nhour, then washed for a few seconds in dilute nitric acid (one part of\r\nnitric acid to two of water), then rinsed in distilled water.\r\n\r\nNeelsen’s Solution and Methylene Blue.--Ziehl suggested the use of\r\ncarbolic acid as a substitute for aniline blue. Neelsen recommended\r\na solution of carbolic acid, absolute alcohol and fuchsine. (See\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\n_Gram’s Solution and Eosin._--After using Gram’s method as above and\r\ndecolourising in alcohol, the cover-glass is placed in a weak solution\r\nof eosin for two or three minutes, washed in alcohol, immersed in clove\r\noil, dried, and mounted in balsam.\r\n\r\n_Staining of Spores._--The cover-glass preparation must be heated to\r\n210° C. for half an hour, or passed about twelve times through the\r\nflame of a Bunsen burner, or exposed to the action of strong sulphuric\r\nacid for several seconds, then a few drops of a watery solution of\r\naniline dye applied in the usual way. To double-stain spore-bearing\r\nbacilli the cover-glass preparation must be floated from twenty minutes\r\nto an hour on Ehrlich’s fuchsine-aniline-water, or on the Ziehl-Neelsen\r\nsolution. The stain must be heated until steam arises.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaining of Flagella.\r\n\r\nKoch first stained flagella by floating the cover-glass on a watery\r\nsolution of hæmatoxylin, transferring them to a five per cent. solution\r\nof chromic acid, or to Müller’s fluid, by which they obtained a\r\nbrownish-black coloration.\r\n\r\n_Löffler’s Method._--Add together aqueous solutions of ferrous-sulphate\r\nand tannin (twenty per cent.) until the mixture turns a violet-black\r\ncolour, then add three or four cc. of a one-in-eight aqueous\r\nsolution of logwood; a few drops of carbolic acid may be added\r\nbefore transferring to a stoppered bottle; that is the mordant. The\r\ndye consists of 1 cc. of a one per cent. solution of caustic soda,\r\nadded to 100 cc. of aniline water, in which four or five grammes of\r\neither methyl-violet, methylene blue, or fuchsine, are dissolved. A\r\ncover-glass preparation is made in the usual way, then the film is\r\ncovered with mordant, and cover-glass held over flame until steam\r\nrises, the mordant is then washed off with distilled water. The stain\r\nis filtered and a few drops allowed to fall on film, after a few\r\nminutes the cover-glass is again warmed until steam rises. The stain is\r\nthen washed off with distilled water, and the preparation is ready to\r\nbe mounted for examination.\r\n\r\nAs Löffler’s process is somewhat complicated, a modification has been\r\nsaid to afford more satisfactory results. A specimen is taken from\r\na recent gelatine culture and diluted with water. A little of the\r\nfluid is then transferred to a warm cover-glass by means of a pipette\r\nand allowed to dry, after which a drop of the following mordant is\r\napplied:--Aqueous solution of tannin (twenty per cent.), ten cc.; cold\r\nsaturated solution of ferrous sulphate, five cc.; saturated solution of\r\nfuchsine in absolute alcohol, one cc. The cover is next heated gently\r\nfor a short time until vapours are given off, then washed carefully.\r\nThis process is repeated two or three times, and the specimen washed\r\nafter each application. Subsequently, staining is effected by means\r\nof Ziehl’s fuchsine solution, the cover is afterwards warmed once or\r\ntwice for about fifteen seconds, then washed, and the specimen examined\r\nin water to ascertain if the colour is sufficiently intense. If\r\nsatisfactory, the preparation may then be dried and finally mounted in\r\nCanada balsam or dammar.\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Preparations._--After examining a cover-glass\r\npreparation with an oil-immersion objective the cedar oil must be\r\ncarefully wiped off, and the slide set aside for the Canada balsam to\r\nset. At a convenient time these preparations should be sealed with a\r\nring of Hollis’s glue.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteria in Sections of Tissues.\r\n\r\n_Method of Hardening and Decalcifying Tissues._--To harden small\r\norgans, such as the viscera of a mouse, they should be placed on a\r\npiece of filter-paper at the bottom of a small wide-mouthed glass jar,\r\nand covered with about twenty times their volume of absolute alcohol.\r\nLarger organs are treated in the same way, but must be cut up into\r\nsmall pieces. Müller’s fluid, methylated spirit, or formalin may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nTeeth, or osseous structures, must first be placed in a decalcifying\r\nsolution, as Kleinenberg’s. When sufficiently softened, soak in water,\r\nto wash out picric acid, and transfer to weak spirit. Ebner’s solution\r\ngives good results.\r\n\r\nMethods of embedding, fixing, and cutting.--Crookshank finds that\r\nafter hardening, the pieces of tissue are embedded in a mixture of\r\nether and alcohol for an hour or more, then transferred to a solution\r\nof celloidin in equal parts of ether and alcohol, and left there for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nThe piece of tissue is then placed in a glass capsule, and some of the\r\ncelloidin solution poured over it. The capsule can be placed bodily in\r\n60 to 80 per cent. alcohol, and left there until the following morning.\r\nThe celloidin should be of the consistency of wax. The piece of tissue\r\nis next cut out, and after trimming is put into water until it sinks,\r\nthen transferred to gum, and cut with the freezing microtome.\r\n\r\nSections of fresh tissues are to be floated in ·8 per cent. salt\r\nsolution, and then carefully transferred by a platinum lifter to a\r\nwatch-glass containing absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Staining Bacteria in Tissue Sections._--Weigert’s method is as\r\nfollows:--Place sections for from six to eighteen hours in a one per\r\ncent. watery solution of any of the basic aniline dyes. To hasten,\r\nplace the capsule containing solution in the incubator, or heat it to\r\n45° C., or a stronger solution may be used. In the latter case the\r\nsections must be treated with a half-saturated solution of carbonate of\r\npotash, as they are easily over-stained. In either case the sections\r\nare next washed with distilled water, passed through sixty per cent.\r\nalcohol into absolute alcohol. When almost decolourised, spread\r\nout on a platinum lifter and transfer to clove oil, or stain with\r\npicro-carmine solution (Weigert’s) for half an hour, wash in water,\r\nalcohol, and treat with clove oil, and transfer to clean glass slide.\r\n\r\n_Gram’s Method._--Sections are stained for ten minutes in a capsule\r\ncontaining aniline-gentian-violet solution, then placed in the iodine\r\nand iodide solution until uniformly brown, then placed in absolute\r\nalcohol, and washed by carefully moving sections in the liquid with a\r\nglass rod. When completely decolourised, they are transferred to clove\r\noil and then to a slide.\r\n\r\nDouble-staining is obtained by transferring the sections after\r\ndecolourisation to eosin, Bismarck brown, or vesuvin (Crookshank).\r\n\r\n_Formalin_ is an excellent preservative fluid; one part to 20,000 is\r\nsufficient to prevent fermentation. For the preservation of vegetable\r\nsections, a one per cent. solution is required; even the fresh\r\nappearance of vegetable structures is preserved for some time when\r\nimmersed in it. In the nutrient gelatine for biological specimens, if\r\nused early, will arrest the liquefaction of the gelatine by bacteria.\r\nFor hardening it saves time, and is even better than alcohol, chromic\r\nacid, pot. bich., and many others. It does not cause shrinkage of\r\nthe cells. Tissue 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick hardens in twenty-four hours\r\nin pure formalin; five to ten per cent. is best for loose tissue. In\r\nanother method, by which time can be saved, instead of placing the\r\nspecimen in the _formalin_ and afterwards in mucilage, prior to cutting\r\nsections, make the mucilage with two per cent. (or stronger) formalin\r\nwater, and it will then answer both purposes at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing, Mounting, Cementing and Collecting Objects.\r\n\r\nVarious materials are required for preparing and mounting microscopic\r\nobjects, as slips of glass, patent flatted plate measuring 3 × 1 inch,\r\nthin glass covers, glass cells, preservative media, varnishes, cements,\r\na glazier’s diamond, and a Shadbolt’s turn-table.\r\n\r\nThe glass slides and covers, although sent out packed ready for use,\r\nshould be immersed in an alkaline solution to ensure perfect freedom\r\nfrom any greasiness derived from touching by the fingers. Dr. Seller\r\nrecommends a particular solution for this purpose. (See _Formulæ_,\r\nAppendix.)\r\n\r\nVarnishes and cements must be selected with care, as these are not only\r\nexpected to adhere firmly to the glass slide, but also to resist the\r\naction of the preservative fluid in which the specimen may be mounted.\r\nAmong the numerous preparations employed, I may enumerate Canada\r\nbalsam, gum dammar, Venice turpentine, Japanners’ gold size, used for\r\nclosing up cells, asphalte varnish, Brunswick black, shellac, glue and\r\nhoney, Hollis’ liquid glue, and marine glue. To give a finish to the\r\nmounted specimen, coloured varnishes are sometimes resorted to. A red\r\nvarnish of sealing-wax is made by digesting powdered sealing-wax in\r\nstrong alcohol. Filter, and place the solution in a dish, and evaporate\r\nby means of a sand bath to reduce it to a proper consistency. This\r\nis said to resist the action of cedar oil. For white, zinc, cement\r\nis the best. This is made of benzole, gum dammar, oxide of zinc, and\r\nturpentine. Cole gives another formula, but either of these may be\r\nobtained of Squire, who supplies every kind of staining and mounting\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--Walmsley’s Cell-making Turn-table.]\r\n\r\n_Cells for Mounting._--The minuter forms of life should be mounted in\r\nthin cells, which may be readily made with Japanners’ gold size, dammar\r\nor asphalte, and a Shadbolt or Walmsley’s turntable. The glass slide\r\nbeing placed under the metal springs in such a manner that its two\r\nends shall be equi-distant from the centre (a guide to the position is\r\nafforded by the circles traced out on the brass), take a camel’s hair\r\npencil and dip it into the Japanner’s gold-size, holding it firmly\r\nbetween the finger and thumb, and set the wheel in motion, when a\r\nperfect circle will be formed; put it aside to dry, or place it in the\r\nwarm chamber to harden. To cut cover-glasses place a sheet of thin\r\nglass under the brass springs, and substitute for the pencil a cutting\r\ndiamond. A cutting diamond is not only useful to the microscopist for\r\nthe above purpose, but also for writing the names of mounted objects on\r\none end of the slide.\r\n\r\nIt will be found convenient to make a number of such cells, and keep\r\na stock ready for use. There are many objects whose structure is very\r\ntransparent. These should be mounted dry. Scales from the wings of\r\nbutterflies and moths, of the podura and lepisma, and some of the\r\ndiatomaceæ are of this class. All that is necessary in preparing\r\nobjects for dry mounting is to take care that they are free from\r\nextraneous matter, and fix them permanently in the position in which\r\ntheir structure will show to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nFor mounting specimens of greater thickness it is desirable to use\r\ndeeper cells. It will then be found convenient to make a second or a\r\nthird application of the gold-size, allowing sufficient time between\r\napplications for the varnish to dry. Cells of a still deeper kind\r\nare made up by cementing rings of glass or metal to the glass-slides\r\nwith marine glue or Brunswick black. The latter will be rendered more\r\ndurable by mixing in a small quantity of indiarubber varnish (made\r\nby dissolving small strips of caoutchouc in gas-tar). The process\r\nof mounting in glass-cells is similar to that employed in making\r\nvarnish-cells, except that a somewhat larger quantity of cementing\r\nmedium is required. Objects mounted in this way should be kept for a\r\ntime in the horizontal position, and a little fresh varnish must be\r\napplied if the cement shows a tendency to crack. In mounting objects\r\nin balsam, care must be taken to have the specimen _quite dry_ before\r\ntransferring it to turpentine. Objects mounted in cells should become\r\n_perfectly saturated_ with the mounting fluid before being finally\r\ncemented down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.--Glass-cells for Mounting.]\r\n\r\nIt is preferable to mount and preserve specimens of animal tissues\r\nin shallow cells, to avoid undue pressure on the preparation. Cells\r\nintended to contain preparations immersed in fluid must be made of\r\na substance impervious to the fluid used, such as here represented\r\n(Fig. 263). The surface of the fixed glass-circle should be slightly\r\nroughened before applying the cement.\r\n\r\nDifferent modes of mounting may be employed with advantage; for\r\ninstance, entomological specimens, as legs, wings, spiracles, tracheæ,\r\novipositors, stings, tongues, palates, corneæ, should be mounted in\r\nbalsam; the trachea of the house-cricket, however, should be mounted\r\ndry. Sections of bone may either be mounted dry or in a fluid. Other\r\nobjects, as sections of wood and stones of fruit, exhibit their\r\nstructure best in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nIn mounting entomological specimens, the first thing, of course,\r\nis the dissection of the insect. This is best accomplished by the\r\naid of a dissecting microscope, a pair of small brass forceps, and\r\nfinely-pointed scissors; the parts to be prepared and mounted should\r\nfirst be carefully detached from the insect with the scissors, then\r\nimmersed in a solution of caustic alkali (_liquor potassæ_) for a few\r\ndays, to soften and dissolve out the fat and soft parts. The length\r\nof time necessary for their immersion can only be determined by\r\nexperience, but, as a general rule, the objects assume a certain amount\r\nof transparency when they have been long enough in the alkali; when\r\nthis is ascertained, the object must be placed in a proper receptacle\r\nand put by to soak for two or three hours in soft or distilled water.\r\nIt should then be placed between two slips of glass, and gently pressed\r\ntill the softer parts are removed. Should any adhere to the edge of\r\nthe object, it will be necessary to wash the specimen carefully in\r\nwater, a process that will be much assisted by the delicate touches\r\nof a camel’s-hair brush. Place the object now and then under the\r\nmicroscope to see that all extraneous matter is removed, and when this\r\nis accomplished take the specimen up carefully with the camel’s-hair\r\nbrush, or a lifter, and place it on a piece of very smooth paper (thick\r\nivory note is the best for the purpose), arrange it carefully with the\r\nbrush and a finely pointed needle, place a second piece of paper over\r\nit, and press it flat between two slips of glass, and compress it by a\r\nsmall spring clip (Fig. 264). A dozen clips may be had for a few pence.\r\nWhen _thoroughly_ dry (which it will probably be in about twenty-four\r\nhours, if in a warm room), separate the glasses, and gently unfold the\r\npaper; then, with a little careful manipulation, the object may be\r\nreadily detached, and placed in a little spirit of turpentine, where\r\nit should be allowed to remain until rendered transparent and fit for\r\nmounting. The time during which it should remain in this liquid will\r\ndepend on the structure; some objects, such as wings of flies, will be\r\nquickly permeated, while horny and dense objects require an immersion\r\nof a fortnight or even longer. A pomatum pot with a _concave_ bottom\r\nand well-fitting lid will answer admirably for conducting the soaking\r\nprocess in; and it is well, in preparing several specimens at a time,\r\nto have two pots, one for large and medium, the other for very small\r\nobjects, otherwise the smaller will adhere to the larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.--Spring Clip for Mounting.]\r\n\r\nIn mounting objects in fluid, the glass cover should come nearly, but\r\n_not quite_, to the edge of the cell, a slight margin being left for\r\nthe cement, which should project slightly over the edge of the cover,\r\nin order to secure it to the cell.\r\n\r\n_Media for Preserving Algæ._--The most useful preservative media for\r\nalgæ are chrome-alum, formalin, and camphor water. The solution should\r\nconsist of one per cent. of chrome-alum and one per cent. of formalin;\r\nthis will render the gelatinous sheath and matrix form clear, while it\r\nwill retain the colour of the algæ in most cases. The Chlorophyceæ do\r\nwell in any of these media; but other species, as _Ulva Lactuca_, are\r\nrendered somewhat brittle. For such use formalin alone. The Phæophyceæ\r\nshould be placed while fresh in the formalin; the larger forms are\r\nbetter fixed by placing them for an hour or two in chrome-alum\r\nsolution. The Florideæ do well in any of the three solutions, but the\r\nmore delicate species, _Griffithsia_, require a two per cent. formalin\r\nsolution in sea-water; the plant preserves its natural appearance in\r\nthis medium.\r\n\r\nTo preserve and mount diatomaceæ in as nearly as possible a natural\r\ncondition, they should be first well washed in distilled water and\r\nmounted in a medium composed of one part of spirits of wine to seven\r\nparts of distilled water. The siliceous coverings of the diatoms,\r\nhowever, which show various beautiful forms under the higher powers\r\nof the microscope, require more care in preparation. The guano, or\r\ninfusorial earth containing them, should first be washed several times\r\nin water till the water is colourless, allowing sufficient time for\r\nprecipitation between each washing. The deposit must then be put into\r\na test tube and nitro-hydrochloric acid (equal parts of nitric and\r\nhydrochloric acids) added to it, when a violent effervescence will\r\ntake place. When this has subsided, the whole should be subjected to\r\nheat, brought nearly to the boiling point for six or eight hours. The\r\nacid must now be carefully poured off, and the precipitate washed\r\nin a _large_ quantity of water, allowing some three or four hours\r\nbetween each washing, for the subsidence of some of the lighter forms.\r\nThe sediment must be examined under the microscope with an inch\r\nobject-glass, and the siliceous valves of the diatoms picked out with a\r\ncoarse hair or bristle.\r\n\r\nDr. Rezner’s Mechanical Finger (Fig. 265) for selecting and arranging\r\ndiatoms, adaptable to any microscope, is made to slip on to the\r\nobjective far enough to have a firm bearing, and so that the bristle\r\npoint can be brought into focus when depressed to its limit. It is\r\nclamped in its place by a small thumb-screw. The bristle holder slides\r\ninto its place, and is carefully adjusted to the centre of the field.\r\nWhen using the finger, the bristle is first raised by means of the\r\nmicrometer screw till so far within focus as to be nearly or quite\r\ninvisible, then the objective is focussed on to the slide, and the\r\ndesired object sought for and brought into the centre of the field;\r\nthe bristle point is then lowered by the screw until it reaches the\r\nobject, which usually adheres to it at once, and can then be examined\r\nby rotating the bristle wire by means of the milled head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.--Rezner’s Mechanical Finger.]\r\n\r\nThe medium used for mounting diatomaceæ is of considerable importance,\r\ninasmuch as their visibility is either diminished or much increased\r\nthereby. Professor Abbe, experimenting with the more minute test\r\nobjects, diatoms, &c., found monobromide of naphthaline gave increased\r\ndefinition to most of them. This liquid is colourless, somewhat of an\r\noleaginous nature, and is soluble in alcohol. Its density is 1·555, and\r\nrefractive index 1·6. Its index of visibility is about twice that of\r\nCanada balsam.\r\n\r\nTaking the refractive index of air as 1·0, and diatomaceous silex as\r\n1·43, the visibility may be expressed by the _difference_ ·43.\r\n\r\nThe following table may be constructed :--\r\n\r\n     Refractive indices                  Visibility of silex\r\n   (taken approximately).               (Refr. index = 1·43).\r\n  Water                        =  1·33           10\r\n  Canada balsam                =  1·54           11\r\n  Bisulphide of carbon         =  1·68           25\r\n  Sol. of sulphur in bisulph.  =  1·75           32\r\n     \"    phosphorus    \"      =  2·11           67\r\n\r\nThese data relating to visibility must be taken in connection with the\r\nnumerical aperture of the objectives and of the illuminating pencil.\r\nThe effect produced on diatoms is very remarkable, the markings on\r\ntheir siliceous frustules being visible under much lower powers.\r\n\r\nSo that the visibility of the diatom mounted in phosphorus as compared\r\nwith balsam is as sixty-seven to eleven; in other words, the image is\r\nsix times more visible. Mr. Stephenson’s phosphorus medium is composed\r\nof a solution of solid or stick phosphorous dissolved in bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. Great care is required in preparing the solution owing to the\r\nvery inflammable nature of the materials. So small a quantity of the\r\nbisulphide of carbon is required to dissolve the phosphorus that the\r\ndiatom may be said to be mounted in nearly pure phosphorus. Remarkable\r\nenough, this medium has the reverse effect upon such test-objects as\r\npodura and lepisma scales. These lose their characteristic markings.\r\n\r\nFor mounting minute objects, carbolic acid solution will be found a\r\nuseful medium--the purest crystals of carbolic acid dissolved in just\r\nsufficient water to render them fluid. No more should be dissolved than\r\nmay be wanted for the time being, as if left standing exposed to the\r\nlight it changes colour. Small crustacean foraminifera, the palates of\r\nmoluscs, after boiling a short time in liquid potash and well washing\r\nto remove all traces of alkali, may be preserved in carbolic acid\r\nsolution. Should the specimens appear cloudy gently warm the slide over\r\na spirit lamp.\r\n\r\n_Preserving and Killing Rotatoria with cilia in situ._--Mr. C.\r\nRousselet’s method of preserving and mounting the Rotatoria[47] has\r\nbeen attended with so much success that the old difficulty attendant\r\nupon the preservation of these various beautiful forms of infusorial\r\nlife has been practically overcome. The process resorted to consists\r\nof four stages, namely, narcotising, killing, fixing, and preserving.\r\nIn dealing with rotifers hitherto, the difficulty has been that of\r\nsuccessfully killing them with their rotating organs fully extended.\r\nIt has been found needful to have recourse in the first instance to\r\na narcotising agent, and one that acts slowly. The most suitable is\r\na weak solution of the hydrochlorate of cocaine, a one per cent.\r\nsolution, or even weaker. This was first proposed by Mr. Weber for\r\nkeeping these active little bodies quiet while under observation. Mr.\r\nRousselet carries this agent further; he applied it to narcotise them\r\nprior to killing, and this it does most effectually. The rotifers are\r\nseen to sink to the bottom of the live-cell, and the cilia gradually\r\nto slacken in motion, and the time for killing has arrived. This is\r\neffected by Flemming’s chromo-aceto-osmic acid. A rather weak solution\r\nmust be employed--consisting of 1 per cent. solution of chromic acid,\r\n15 parts; 2 per cent. osmic acid, 4 parts; glacial acetic acid, 1\r\npart--which is at the same time a killing and fixing medium. The word\r\n“fixing” must not be taken to imply simply fixing, as it includes\r\nrapidly _killing_ and _hardening_ and preventing further change in\r\nthe tissues of the rotifers by subsequent treatment, as mounting. The\r\nanimal, therefore, must remain quietly for a few minutes, and then\r\ntaken out and washed in five or six changes of distilled water, and\r\nhence transferred to the preservative fluid. All this must be effected\r\nwith great care. The best preservative fluid is simply distilled water,\r\nrendered antiseptic by a trace of the fixing solution (about eight\r\ndrops to an ounce of water) giving the slightest tinge of yellow to\r\nthe solution. This slight tinge of colour is imparted to the rotifers,\r\notherwise they remain transparent and unchanged, while the nervous\r\ntissue throughout the body is brought out to perfection.\r\n\r\nSome slight difference in treatment is required by certain species, as\r\nthat of _Asplanchna priodonta_; after the application of the cocaine\r\nsolution, which should be added slowly, that is, by letting a few\r\ndrops trickle down the side of the live-trough; this, being heavier\r\nthan water, sinks to the bottom, thus narcotising the rotifers, and\r\nassisting to kill them with the cilia fully expanded. They should be\r\nleft quietly for fifteen minutes, then thoroughly washed with distilled\r\nwater. On further experimenting, Mr. Rousselet found that a weaker\r\nsolution of osmic acid alone, 1/4 per cent., answers quite as well\r\nas, if not better than, Flemming’s fluid; even this must be allowed\r\nto act for only a very short time--a minute at most; the rotifers\r\nthen remain white and transparent, excepting the ova, in which a\r\nfat-like substance, _lecithene_, is secreted. If they become too much\r\nstained, they may be decolourised by passing them through peroxide of\r\nhydrogen. For narcotising the following solution has been found most\r\nuseful:--Take a 2 per cent. solution of cocaine hydrochlorate, 3 parts;\r\nmethylated spirit of wood naphtha, 1 part; and distilled water, 6\r\nparts. This must be added as before directed, drop by drop, watching\r\nthe effect upon the rotifers under the microscope.\r\n\r\nAll the rotatoria may be killed and preserved in the same way. For\r\nmounting, Mr. Rousselet prefers a slightly _hollowed-out_ glass cell,\r\nthe advantage of which is that the rotifers are kept to the centre,\r\nand cannot move to the edge. A little difficulty at first presents\r\nitself to exclude air-bubbles, but this, with a little care, can be\r\novercome by placing a drop of a two or three per cent. solution of\r\nformalin, just sufficient to fill the cell. Then transfer the rotifers\r\nwith a dipping pipette to the cell, and lower the cover-glass down very\r\ngently, removing any excess of fluid by blotting-paper. The best cement\r\nfor the cover-glass is gold-size.\r\n\r\n_Method of Cementing._--After many years’ experience, I have arrived\r\nat the conclusion that for cementing down the cover-glass there is\r\nnothing better than either gold size or gum dammar varnish. The latter,\r\nfor some preparations, will be improved by the addition of a small\r\nproportion of indiarubber dissolved in naphtha. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\nShould glycerine be preferred, carefully wash away any surplus quantity\r\nby gently syringing; then apply a ring of waterproof cement round the\r\ncover-glass. An inexpensive one can be made by dissolving ten grains of\r\ngum-ammoniac in an ounce of acetic acid, and adding to this solution\r\ntwo drachms of Cox’s gelatine. This liquid flows easily from the brush\r\nand is waterproof, rendered more so if subsequently brushed over with\r\na solution of ten grains of bichromate of potash in an ounce of water.\r\nAn especial recommendation to this cement is its adhesiveness to glass,\r\neven should there be a little glycerine left behind on the cover. After\r\nthe gelatine ring is thoroughly dry any kind of cement may be employed.\r\n\r\nA useful cement for fixing minute objects, diatoms, &c., temporarily to\r\nthin glass covers, before permanently mounting them in Canada balsam,\r\nis made as follows:--Dissolve, without heat, two or three grains of gum\r\narabic in one ounce of distilled water, then add glacial acetic acid,\r\nthree minims, and the least trace of sugar. Filter carefully through\r\nfilter paper, and repeat this in the course of three or four weeks.\r\nThis cement will be unaffected by the balsam.\r\n\r\n_Mounting Chara._--It is often found difficult to preserve and mount\r\nthe fruit of chara, but this can be successfully accomplished in\r\nglycerine jelly, by taking the following precautions. After cleaning\r\nthe specimen place it in 92 per cent. of alcohol for several hours,\r\nthen transfer it to a mixture of equal parts of spirit and glycerine\r\nfor several hours longer, pour off nearly all the mixture, and add pure\r\nglycerine at intervals till the glycerine becomes concentrated. The\r\nspecimen is then mounted in glycerine jelly in a cell just deep enough\r\nto take it without pressure.\r\n\r\nThere are some objects much more difficult to prepare than others, and\r\nwhich tax the patience of the beginner in a manner which can hardly\r\nbe imagined by any one who has never made the attempt. The structure\r\nof many creatures is so delicate as to require the very greatest care\r\nto prevent mutilation, and consequent spoliation, of the specimen.\r\nThe beginner, therefore, must not be discouraged by a few failures in\r\ncommencing, but should persevere in his attempts, and constant practice\r\nwill soon teach him the best way of managing intricate and difficult\r\nobjects. The room in which he operates should be free from dust, smoke,\r\nand intrusion, and everything used should be kept scrupulously clean,\r\nsince a very small speck of dirt, which may be almost invisible to the\r\nnaked eye, will assume unpleasant proportions under the microscope, and\r\nnot only mar, but possibly spoil a fine and delicate preparation.\r\n\r\nFew students on commencing to work with the microscope will fully\r\nrealise the fact that under medium or high powers the natural\r\nappearance of almost all objects is changed by the refractive nature of\r\nthe fluid medium in which they are immersed and which enters more or\r\nless into their composition. The remarkable changes effected by the law\r\nof diffusion, when alkaloid substances enter into their composition,\r\nshow the necessity of taking every precaution in the employment of\r\npreservative fluids. Glycerine affords an example of the chemical\r\nchange induced, should the preparation have been passed through an\r\nalkaline solution.\r\n\r\n_Air Bubbles_ are a constant source of annoyance both in preparing and\r\nmounting. These may be removed from the specimen by gently warming the\r\nunder part of the slide over a spirit lamp, or placing the slide in\r\nthe warm chamber, when the bubbles will move towards the edge of the\r\ncover-glass and ultimately disappear. The air-pump is preferred by many\r\nmicroscopists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollection of Objects.\r\n\r\n_Infusorial Life_, with all its fascinations, was fully unveiled to\r\nnaturalists by the celebrated Ehrenberg. It was he who termed it\r\ninfusorial, because he first met with the more interesting forms\r\nof minute life in infusions of hay and other vegetable substances.\r\nSince his day it is a well-known experience of those who take up the\r\nmicroscope that the most interesting objects to commence with are\r\ninfusorial living creatures of sufficient dimensions to be easily\r\nunderstood and seen with moderate magnifying powers. Moreover,\r\ninfusoria are more readily found in almost any pool or running stream\r\nof water, either near the surface or clinging to the under surfaces\r\nof aquatic plants. At one time all the small shallow pools in the\r\nneighbourhood of London--Hampstead Heath, Clapham, Wandsworth, and\r\nother commons--abounded in the most interesting forms of life, were\r\nfamous hunting grounds for the marvellous volvox, the charming dismid\r\nand diatom, the wonderful budding and self-dividing hydra. A few hours’\r\nramble furnished the microscopist with a bountiful supply of these and\r\nmany other forms of life. Now all is changed; our commons have been\r\ndevoted to other purposes, and with the general _levelling_ up all the\r\nlittle pools have disappeared, and the microscopist has been warned\r\noff and driven further afield, or seeks the good offices of a country\r\nfriend for an occasional peep into pond life.[48]\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful, however, judiciously taken from a well-chosen locality\r\nwill often be found to contain a variety of living forms, every one of\r\nwhich will deserve a careful and patient study.\r\n\r\nOf the microscopic organisms, the collection of which requires no\r\nother methods than those ordinarily pursued by the naturalist, most\r\nof them must be sought for in pools or running waters, basking in the\r\nsunshine, clinging to leaves and rootlets of all aquatic plants; some\r\nfreely moving about, others clinging to stones or pieces of wood at the\r\nbottom. Dismids congregate in shallow waters or rise to the surface\r\nin a quiet nook, while the diatomaceæ are seen covering the bottom of\r\nclear water, to which they give a yellowish-brown tinge of colour.\r\n\r\nInfusorial animal life, as vorticellæ, stentors, rotifers, and\r\nvarious polyzoa, cling, as also do hydra, in colonies to vallisneria,\r\nduck-weed, frogbit, or small branches dipping down under water; and\r\nif some of the water-weed is brought home the little creatures will\r\nlive and thrive for several weeks. No waters, however, are so full of\r\nminute animal life as the sphagnum bog. A number of species of diatoms,\r\nas well as protozoids and the smaller molluscs, will be found in all\r\npeat bogs. It is remarkable, too, that the same species, everywhere,\r\nare associated with this kind of moss. Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborn\r\nsupplied his friends with moss growing in a damp part of the garden\r\nwalk of his rectory; this always furnished the same species of\r\nrotifers. These proved to be most interesting objects to my friends,\r\nand in an early communication I described them as _indestructible_,\r\nsince they will bear any amount of desiccation; nevertheless, they were\r\nrevived when a drop of water was introduced into the glass-cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.--Collecting Stick, Bottle, Hook, and Net.]\r\n\r\nThe Thames mud always furnishes a number of beautiful forms of\r\ntriceratum. Lower down the river, as brackish water is reached, greater\r\nvarieties of diatoms appear. But to secure them the collector must be\r\nprovided with a collecting stick. A convenient form is furnished by\r\nMessrs. Baker (Fig. 266). This consists of an ordinary walking-stick,\r\ntogether with a lengthening rod, a cutting hook to clear away weeds,\r\nringed bottles with screw tops, and a net with a glass tube attached.\r\nTheir uses are too obvious to need further description.\r\n\r\nThe siliceous skeletons of diatoms are met with in the fossil state.\r\nAmong the first discovered of the infusorial strata were the polishing\r\nslates of Bilin and Tripoli, the berg-mehl or mountain meal, the entire\r\nmass of which is composed of the siliceous skeletons of different\r\nspecies of diatoms. Richmond, Virginia, is rich in the same organisms,\r\nwhile the great mass of our chalk cliffs are composed of foraminiferous\r\nshells, xanthidiæ, &c. One remarkable fact in connection with fossil\r\ninfusoria is that most of the forms are still found in the recent\r\nstate. The beautiful engine-turned discs, _Coscinodisci_, so abundant\r\nin the Richmond earth, may be met with in our own seas, and in great\r\nprofusion in the deposits of guano on the African and American coasts,\r\nand in the stomachs of the oyster, scallop, and other salt-water\r\nmolluscous animals common to our shores.\r\n\r\nA great number of infusorial earths may be mounted as dry objects,\r\nwhile others require careful washing and digesting in appropriate\r\nmedia. The finer portions of the sediments will be found to contain the\r\nbetter and more perfect siliceous shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing and Mounting Apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.--Mounting Apparatus.\r\n\r\n1.--Ross’s instrument for cutting thin covering-glass for objects. This\r\napparatus consists of a bent arm supporting the cutting portion of this\r\napparatus, which consists of a vertical rod with a soft cork at one\r\nend.

By its aid the foundation of mycology has been securely laid,\r\nand cryptogamic botany in particular has, during the last quarter of\r\na century, made surprising progress in the hands of those devoted to\r\npursuits which confer benefits upon mankind.\r\n\r\nLittle more than thirty years ago practically nothing was known of\r\nthe life history of a fungus, nothing of parasitism, of infectious\r\ndiseases, or even of fermentation. Our knowledge of the physiology of\r\nnutrition was in its infancy; even the significance of starches and\r\nsugars in the green plant was as yet not understood, while a number\r\nof the most important facts relating to plants and the physiology\r\nof animals were unknown and undiscovered. When we reflect on these\r\nmatters, and remember that bacteria were regarded merely as curious\r\nanimalculæ, that rusts and smuts were supposed to be emanations of\r\ndiseased states, and that spontaneous generation still-survived among\r\nus, some idea may be formed of the condition of cryptogamic botany and\r\nthe lower forms of animal life some eight or ten years after my book on\r\nthe microscope made its first appearance (1854).\r\n\r\nIndeed, long prior to this time, dating from that of even the earliest\r\nworkers with the microscope, it was known that the water of pools and\r\nditches, and especially infusions of plants and animals of all kinds,\r\nteem with living organisms, but it was not recognised definitely that\r\nvast numbers of these microscopic living beings (and even actively\r\nmoving ones) are plants, growing on and in the various solid and liquid\r\nmatters examined, and as truly as visible and accepted plants grow on\r\nsoil and in the air and water. Perhaps the most important discovery\r\nin the history of cryptogamic botany was initiated here. The change,\r\nthen, that has come over our knowledge of microscopic plant life during\r\nthis last busy quarter of a century has been almost entirely due to the\r\ninitiation and improvement, first in methods of growing them, and in\r\nthe methods of “_Microscopic Gardening_”; and secondly, to the greater\r\nknowledge gained in the use of the microscope.\r\n\r\n“If we look at the great groups of plants from a broad point of view,\r\nit is remarkable that the fungi and the phanerogams occupy attention\r\non quite other grounds than do the algæ, mosses, and ferns. Algæ are\r\nespecially a physiologist’s group, employed in questions on nutrition,\r\nreproduction, and cell division and growth; the Bryophyta and\r\nPteridophyta are, on the other hand, the domain of the morphologist.\r\nFungi and Phanerogams, while equally or even more employed by\r\nspecialists in morphology and physiology, appeal widely to general\r\ninterest on the ground of utility.\r\n\r\n“It is very significant that a group like the fungi should have\r\nattracted so much scientific attention, and aroused so general an\r\ninterest at the same time. But the fact that fungi affect our lives\r\ndirectly has been driven home; and whether as poisons or foods,\r\ndestructive moulds or fermentation agents, parasitic mildews or\r\ndisease germs, they occupy more interest than all other cryptogams put\r\ntogether, the flowering plants alone rivalling them in this respect.\r\nA marked feature of the period in which we live will be the great\r\nadvances made in our knowledge of the uses of plants, for, of course,\r\nthis development of economic botany has gone hand in hand with the\r\nprogress of geological botany, the extension of our planting, and the\r\nuseful applications of botany to the processes of home industries.”[49]\r\n\r\nThe intimate organic structure of the vegetable world is seen to\r\nconsist of a variety of different materials indeterminable by\r\nunassisted vision, and for the most part requiring high magnification\r\nfor their discrimination. Chemical analysis had, however, shown\r\nthat vegetables are composed of a few simple substances, water,\r\ncarbonic acid gas, oxygen, nitric acid, and a small portion of\r\ninorganic salts. Out of these simple elements the whole of the\r\nimmense variety of substances produced by the vegetable kingdom are\r\nconstructed. No part of the plant contains fewer than three of these\r\nuniversally distributed elements, hence the greater uniformity in\r\ntheir chemical constituents. It will be seen, then, that the methods\r\nof plant chemistry are of supreme interest both to the chemist and the\r\nphysiologist, or biologist. Plants, while they borrow materials from\r\nthe inorganic, and powers from the physical world, whereby they are\r\nenabled to pass through the several stages of germination, growth, and\r\nreproduction, could not accomplish these transformations without the\r\nall-important aid of light and heat, the combined functions of which\r\nare indispensable to the perfect development of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nLight, then, enables plants to decompose, change into living matter,\r\nand consolidate, the inorganic elements of carbonic acid gas, water,\r\nand ammonia, which are absorbed by the leaves and roots from the\r\natmosphere and earth; the quantity of carbon consolidated being exactly\r\nin proportion to the intensity of the light. Nevertheless, light in\r\nits chemical character is a deoxidising agent, by which the numerous\r\nneutral compounds common to vegetables are formed. It is the principal\r\nagent in preparing the food of plants, and it is during the chemical\r\nchanges spoken of that the specific heat of plants is slowly evolved,\r\nwhich, though generally feeble, is sometimes very sensibly evolved,\r\nespecially so when flowers and fruits are forming, on account of the\r\nincrease of chemical energy at this period.\r\n\r\nThe action of heat is measurable throughout the whole course\r\nof vegetable life, although its manifestations take on various\r\nforms--those suited to the period and circumstances of growth. Upon\r\nthe heat generated depends the formation of protein and nitrogenous\r\nsubstances, which abound more directly in the seed buds, the points of\r\nthe roots, and in all those organs of plants which are in the greatest\r\nstate of activity. The whole chemistry of plant life, in fact, is\r\nmanifest in this production of energy for drawing material from its\r\nsurroundings; therefore the organising power of plants bears a direct\r\nratio to the amount of light and heat acting upon them.\r\n\r\nThe living medium, then, which possesses the marvellous property of\r\nbeing primarily aroused into life and energy, and which either forms\r\nthe whole or the greater portion of every plant, is in its earliest and\r\nsimplest form nothing more than a microscopic cell, consisting of one\r\nor two colourless particles of matter, in closest contact, and wholly\r\nimmersed in a transparent substance somewhat resembling _albumen_\r\n(white of egg), termed _protoplasm_, but differing essentially in its\r\ncharacter and properties. This nearly colourless organisable matter\r\nis the life-blood of the cell. It is sufficiently viscid to maintain\r\nits globular form, and under high powers is seen to have a slightly\r\nconsolidated film enclosing semi-transparent particles, together with\r\nvacuoles which are of a highly refractive nature. These small bodies\r\nare termed nuclei, and they appear to be furnished with an extremely\r\ndelicate enveloping film. In a short time the nuclei increase in\r\nnumber and split up the parent body. The protoplasmic mass, however,\r\nis undoubtedly the true formative material, and is rightly regarded as\r\n“the physical basis of life” of both the vegetable and animal kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain members of the vegetable kingdom which\r\nsomewhat resemble animals in their dependence upon receiving organic\r\ncompounds already formed for them, being themselves unable to effect\r\nthe fixation of the carbon needed to effect the first stage in their\r\nafter chemical transformations. Such is the case with a large class\r\nof flowering plants, among Phanerogams, and the leafless parasites\r\nwhich draw their support chiefly from the tissues of their hosts. It\r\nis likewise the case with regard to the whole group of fungi; the\r\nlower cryptogams, which derive the greater portion of their nutritive\r\nmaterials from organic matter undergoing some form of histolysis;\r\nwhile others belonging to this group have the power of originating\r\ndecomposition by a fermentative (_zymotic_) action peculiarly their\r\nown. There are many other protophytes which live by absorption, and\r\nwhich appear to take in no solid matter, but draw nourishment from the\r\natmosphere or the water in which they exist.\r\n\r\nWith regard to motion, this was at one time considered the distinctive\r\nattribute of animal life, but many protophytes possess a spontaneity of\r\npower and motion, while others are furnished with curious motile organs\r\ntermed _cilia_, or whip-like appendages, _flagella_, by which their\r\nbodies are propelled with considerable force through the water in which\r\nthey live.\r\n\r\nHenceforth this protoplasmic substance was destined to take an\r\nimportant position in the physiological world. It is, then, desirable\r\nto enter somewhat more fully into the life history of so remarkable\r\na body. It has a limiting membrane, composed of a substance somewhat\r\nallied to starch, termed _cellulose_, one of the group of compounds\r\nknown as carbo-hydrates. The mode of formation and growth of this\r\ncell wall is not yet definitely determined; nevertheless, it is the\r\nuniversal framework or skeleton of the vegetable world, although it\r\nappears to play no special part in their vital functions. It merely\r\nserves the purpose of a protecting membrane to the globular body called\r\nthe “_primordial cell_,” which permanently constitutes the living\r\nprinciple upon which the whole fundamental phenomena of growth and\r\nreproduction depend.\r\n\r\nSometimes this protoplasmic material is seen to constitute the whole\r\nplant; and so with regard to the simplest known forms of animal\r\nlife--the amœba, for example. That so simple and minute an organism\r\nshould be capable of independent motion is indeed surprising. Dujardin,\r\na French physiologist, termed this animated matter _sarcode_. On a\r\ncloser study of the numerous forms of animal life it was found that\r\nall were alike composed of this sarcode substance, some apparently not\r\nhaving a cell wall. The same seemed to hold good of certain higher\r\nforms of cells, the colourless blood corpuscles for instance, which\r\nunder high powers of the microscope are seen to change their shape,\r\nmoving about by the streaming out of this sarcode. At length the truth\r\ndawned on histologists that the cell contents, rather than the closing\r\nwall, must be the essential structure. On further investigation it\r\nbecame apparent that a far closer similarity existed between vegetables\r\nand animals than was before supposed. Ultimately it was made clear that\r\nthe vegetable protoplasm and the animal sarcode were one and the same\r\nstructure. Max Schultz found this to be the case, and to all intents\r\nand purposes they are identical.\r\n\r\nWe have now to retrace our steps and look somewhat more closely\r\ninto the discovery of that important body, the _cell-nucleus_. It\r\nwas an English botanist, Dr. Robert Brown, who, in 1833, during his\r\nmicroscopical studies of the epidermis of orchids, discovered in their\r\ncells “an opaque spot,” to which soon afterwards he gave the name\r\nof _nucleus_. Schleiden and Schwann’s later researches led them to\r\nthe conclusion that the nucleus is the most characteristic formative\r\nelement in all vegetable and animal tissues in the incipient phase\r\nof existence. It then began to be taught that there is one universal\r\nprinciple of development for the elementary parts of all organisms,\r\nhowever different, and that is the formation of cells. Thus was\r\nenunciated a doctrine which was for all practical purposes absolutely\r\nnew, and which opened out a wide field of further investigation for the\r\nphysiologist, and led up to a fuller knowledge of the cell contents. In\r\nfact, it became a question as to whether the cell contents rather than\r\nthe enclosing wall should not be considered the basis of life, since\r\nthe cell at this time had by no means lost its importance, although it\r\nno longer signified the minute cavity it did when originally discovered\r\nby Schwann. It now implied, as Schultz defined it, “a small mass of\r\nviscid matter, protoplasm, endowed with the attributes of life.” The\r\nnucleus was once more restored to its original importance, and with\r\neven greater significance. In place of being a structure generated _de\r\nnovo_ from non-cellular substance, and disappearing as soon as its\r\nfunction of cell formation is accomplished, the nucleus is now known as\r\nthe central permanent feature of every cell, and indestructible while\r\nthe cell lives, and the parent, by division of its substance, of other\r\ngenerations of nuclei and cells. The word _cell_ has at the same time\r\nreceived its final definition as “a small mass of protoplasm supplied\r\nwith a nucleus.” In short, all the activities of plant and animal life\r\nare really the product of energy liberated solely through _histolysis_,\r\nor destructive processes, amounting to the combustion that takes place\r\nin the ultimate cells of the organisms.\r\n\r\nBut there are other points of especial interest involved in the\r\nquestion of cell formation beside those already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe cell and its contents collectively are termed the _endoplasm_,\r\nor when coloured, as in algæ, _endochrome_. With regard to the outer\r\nlayer of the cell and its growth nothing satisfactory has been clearly\r\ndetermined and finally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe cell as a whole is a protoplasmic mass, and not an emulsion, as\r\nsome observers would have us suppose. It is, in fact, a reticulated\r\ntissue of the most delicate structure, made up of canaliculate spiral\r\nfibrils with hyaline walls capable of expansion and contraction. These\r\nfibrils are probably composed of still finer spirals. The visible\r\ngranulated portion of the protoplasm, the only part that takes a stain\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, is simply the contents of these canals.\r\nIt is the chromatin of Flemming, and is capable of motion within the\r\ncanals. The nucleus, then, is probably nothing more than a granule of\r\nthe extra-cellular net, and is formed by the junction of the several\r\nbands of wall-threads which traverse it in different directions. The\r\ncell wall of plants possesses the same structure as protoplasm, and is\r\nprobably protoplasm impregnated by cellulose.\r\n\r\nIt is this portion of the protoplasmic mass that is now recognised\r\nunder the term _octoplasm_, or primordial utricle, and is of so fine\r\nand delicate a nature that it is only brought into view when separated\r\nfrom the cell wall either by further developmental changes, or by\r\nreagents and certain stains or dyes. It was, in fact, discovered to be\r\na slightly condensed portion of the protoplasmic layer corresponding\r\nto the _octosare_ of the lower forms of animal life. The octoplasm\r\nand cell wall can only be distinguished from each other by chemical\r\ntests. Both nucleus and nucleoli are only rendered visible in the same\r\nway, that is, by staining for several hours in a carmine solution, and\r\nwashing in a weak acetic acid solution.\r\n\r\nWith the enlargement of the cell by the imbibition of water, clear\r\nspaces, termed vacuoles, are seen to occupy a small portion of the\r\ncell, while the nucleus and nucleoli lie close to the parietal layer.\r\n\r\nThe interesting phenomenon of cyclosis, to which I shall have occasion\r\nto refer further on, is now believed to be due to the contractility\r\nof certain wall-threads stretching from the nucleus to the outermost\r\nlayers of the cell. An intimate relationship is thereby established\r\nbetween the nucleus, the nucleolus, and the parietal layer. This much\r\nhas been made clear by the more scientific methods of investigation\r\npursued in the use of the microscope. Nevertheless a large and\r\nimportant class of cells, forming a kind of borderland between the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms, still remains to be dealt with, in which\r\nthe cell contents are only imperfectly differentiated, while numerous\r\nother unicellular organisms, owing to their extreme minuteness,\r\ntenuity, and want of all colour, are apparently devoid of any nucleus,\r\nand when present can only be differentiated by a resort to a specially\r\nconducted method of preparation and staining. There is, however, a\r\nremarkable feature in connection with many micro-organisms--that\r\ncertain of these protophytes possess motive organs, cilia or flagella,\r\nbodies at one time supposed to be characteristic of, and belonging to,\r\nthe protozoa.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, the methods of plant chemistry are of supreme\r\ninterest, the more so because physiologists are in a position to\r\nisolate a single bacterial cell, grow it in certain media, and thus\r\ndevote special attention to it, and keep it for some time under\r\nobservation. In this way it has become possible to further grasp facts\r\nin connection with cell nutrition and the nature of its waste products.\r\nWe have, then, arrived at a stage when the history of the chemical\r\nchanges brought about by bacteria can be more definitely determined, as\r\nwe have here to do with the vegetable cell in its simplest form. The\r\nchemical work performed by these micro-organisms has as yet occupied\r\nonly a few years; nevertheless, the results have been of the most\r\nremarkable and encouraging character.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period an interesting discovery in connection with the\r\npathogenic action of these bodies was, by the labours of Schöenlein,\r\nRobin, and others, brought to the notice of the medical profession,\r\nviz., that certain diseases affecting the human body were due to\r\nvegetable parasites. In 1856 an opportunity offered itself for a\r\nthorough investigation, and the microscopical part of the work fell\r\ninto my hands, with the result that I was able to add considerably to\r\nSchöenlein’s list of parasitic skin diseases. My observations were\r\nin the first instance communicated to the medical journals. But the\r\ngeneralisation arrived at was that “If there be any exceptions to\r\nthe law that parasites select for their sustenance the subjects of\r\ndebility and decay, such exceptions are rarely to be found among the\r\nvegetations belonging to fungi, which invariably derive nutrition from\r\nmatter in a state of lowered vitality, passing into degeneration, or\r\nwherein decomposition has already taken place to a certain extent....\r\nIt scarcely admits of a doubt that all diseases observed of late years\r\namong plants have been due to parasites of the same class favoured by\r\nwant of vigour of growth and atmospheric conditions, and that the\r\ncause of the various murrains of which so much has been heard is also\r\ndue to similar causes.”[50]\r\n\r\nHerein, then, is to be found the solution of a difficulty that so\r\nlong surrounded the question, but which subsequently culminated in\r\nthe specialisation and scientific development of bacteriology, due to\r\nthe unceasing labours of Pasteur, whose solid genius enabled him to\r\novercome the prejudices of those who were at work on other lines, and\r\nwho had no conception of the functions that parasitic organisms fulfil\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nGoing back to my earlier experimental researches to determine the part\r\ntaken by saccharomycetes and saprophytes in fermentation, I find,\r\nfrom correspondence in my possession, that in 1859 I demonstrated to\r\nthe satisfaction of Dr. Bell, F.R.S., the then head of the chemical\r\nlaboratory of Somerset House, that a very small portion of putrefactive\r\nmatter taken from an animal body, a parasitic fungus (_Achorion\r\nSchöenleinii_), a mould (_Aspergillus_ or _Penicillium_), and a yeast\r\n(_Torula cerevisiæ_) would in a short time, and indifferently, set up\r\na ferment in sweet-wort and transform its saccharine elements into\r\nalcohol, differing only in degree (quantitative), and not in kind\r\nor quality. This, then, was the first step in the direction towards\r\nproving symbiotic action between these several parasitic organisms. The\r\nonly apparent difference observed during the fermentative processes was\r\nthat putrefactive (saprophytic) action commenced at a somewhat earlier\r\nstage, and that the percentage of alcohol was also somewhat less.[51]\r\n\r\nIn 1856, also, the ærobic bacteria attracted my attention, and,\r\ntogether with the late Rev. Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborne, I exposed\r\nplates of glass (microscopical slides), covered with glycerine and\r\ngrape sugar, in every conceivable place where we thought it possible to\r\narrest micro-organisms. The result is known, viz., that fungoid bodies\r\n(moulds and bacterial) were taken in great numbers, and varying with\r\nthe seasons. The air of the hospital and sick-room likewise engaged\r\nattention, each of which proved especially rich in parasitic bodies.\r\nDuring the cholera visitation of 1858 the air was rich in ærobic and\r\nanærobic bacteria, while a _blue mist_ which prevailed throughout\r\nthe epidemic yielded a far greater number than at any former period\r\n(represented in Plate I., No. 13). This blue mist attracted the\r\nespecial attention of meteorologists. At a somewhat later period a more\r\nremarkable fungoid disease, the fungus foot of India, _mycetoma_, came\r\nunder my observation, a detailed description of which I contributed to\r\nthe medical journals, and also, with further details, to the “Monthly\r\nMicroscopical Journal” of 1871. Interlacing mycelia, ending in hyphæ,\r\nin this destructive form of parasitic disease were seen to pervade the\r\nwhole of the tissues of the foot, the bony structures being involved,\r\nand it was only possible to stay the action of the parasite by\r\namputation.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, the study of parasitic organisms had at an early period\r\nshared largely in my microscopical work, extending over several years,\r\nand with the result that these micro-organisms were found to exhibit on\r\noccasions great diversity of character, and that different members of\r\nthe bacteria in particular flourish under great diversity of action,\r\nand often under entirely opposite conditions; that they feed upon\r\nwholly different materials, and perform an immense variety of chemical\r\nwork in the media in which they live.\r\n\r\nThe study of the chemistry (_chemotaxis_) of bacteria has, however,\r\ngreatly enlarged our conception of the chemical value and power of\r\nthe vegetable cell, while it is obvious that no more appropriate\r\nor remunerative field of study could engage the attention of the\r\nmicroscopist, as well as the chemist, than that of bacterial life, and\r\nwhich is so well calculated to enlarge our views of created organisms,\r\nwhether belonging to the vegetable or animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogenic Fungi and Moulds.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to go back to the history of the parasitic\r\nfungi to which diseases of various kinds were early attributable.\r\nThe rude microscopes of two and a half centuries ago revealed the\r\nsimple fact that all decomposable substances swarmed with countless\r\nmultitudes of organisms, invisible to ordinary vision. Leuwenhoek, the\r\nfather of microscopy, and whose researches were generally known and\r\naccepted in 1675, tells of his discovery of extremely minute organisms\r\nin rain-water, in vegetable infusions, in saliva, and in scrapings\r\nfrom the teeth; further, he differentiated these living organisms\r\nby their size and form, and illustrated them by means of woodcuts;\r\nand there can be no doubt that his figures are intended to represent\r\nleptothrix filaments, vibrios, and spirilla. In other of his writings\r\nattempts are made to give an idea of the size of these “animalcules”;\r\nhe described them as _a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand_.\r\nFrom his investigations a belief sprung up that malaria was produced\r\nby “animalcules,” and that the plague which visited Toulon and\r\nMarseilles in 1721 arose from a similar cause. Somewhat later on the\r\nnatural history of micro-organisms was more diligently studied, and\r\nwith increasing interest. Müller, in 1786, pointed out that they had\r\nbeen too much given to occupy themselves in finding new organisms, he\r\ntherefore devoted himself to the study of their forms and biological\r\ncharacters, and it was on such data he based a classification. Thus the\r\nscientific knowledge gained of these minute bodies was considerably\r\nadvanced, and the subject now entered upon a new phase: the origin\r\nof micro-organisms. It further resolved itself into two rival\r\ntheories--spontaneous generation, and development from pre-existing\r\ngerms--the discussion over which lasted more than a century. Indeed,\r\nit only ended in 1871, when the originator of the Abiogenesis theory\r\nwithdrew from the contest, and the more scientific investigations of\r\nPasteur (1861) found general acceptance. This indefatigable worker\r\nhad been investigating fermentation, and studying the so-called\r\ndiseases of wines and a contagious disease which was committing ravages\r\namong silkworms. Pasteur in time was able to confirm the belief that\r\nthe “muscadine disease” of silkworms was due to the presence of\r\nmicro-organisms, discernible only by the microscope. The oval, shining\r\nbodies in the moth, worm, and eggs had been previously observed and\r\ndescribed by Nägeli and others, but it was reserved for Pasteur to show\r\nthat when a silkworm whose body contained these organisms was pounded\r\nup in a mortar with water, and painted over the leaves of the tree upon\r\nwhich healthy worms were fed, all took the disease and died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n  AFTER D^R CROOKSHANK      _J. T. Balcomb. del._\r\n\r\nTYPICAL FORMS OF BACTERIA, SCHIZOMYCETES, OR FISSION-FUNGI.]\r\n\r\nAs the contagious particles were transmitted to the eggs, the method\r\nadopted for preventing the spread of the disease was as follows:--Each\r\nfemale moth was kept separate from the others, and allowed to deposit\r\nher eggs, and after death her body was crushed up in a mortar as\r\nbefore, and a drop of the fluid examined under the microscope. When\r\nany trace of muscadine was found present, the whole of the eggs and\r\nbody were burnt. In this way the disease was combated, and ultimately\r\nstamped out.\r\n\r\nPasteur also pointed out that one form or cause of disease must not\r\nbe confounded with another. For example, muscadine, a true fungus\r\n(_Botrytis bassiana_), should not be confounded with another disease\r\nknown to attack silkworms, termed _pebrin_, this being caused by a\r\nbacterium, and, according to the more recent researches of Balbiani, by\r\na Psorospermia. Botrytis is a true mould, belonging to the Oomycetes,\r\nand allied to the potato fungus, Peronospora. It is propagated by\r\nspores, which, falling on a silkworm, germinate and penetrate its body.\r\nA mycelium is then developed, which spreads throughout the body. Hyphæ\r\nappear through the skin, and bear white chalky-looking spores; these\r\nbecome detached, and float in the air as an impalpable dust-like smoke.\r\nDamp further develops the fungus.\r\n\r\nInsects suffer much from the ravages of fungi. The house-fly sticking\r\nto the window-pane is seen to be surrounded by the mycelia of\r\n_Penicillium racemosum_ (_Sporendonema muscæ_, or _Saprolegnia feræ_).\r\nIn other cases Cordiceps attacks certain caterpillars belonging to the\r\ngenera Cossus and Hepialus when they are buried in the sand and before\r\ntheir metamorphosis into chrysalides; they are killed by the rapid\r\ndevelopment of hyphæ and mycelium in their tissues.\r\n\r\n_Sphæria miletaris_, a parasite of _Bombyx pilyocarpa_, the caterpillar\r\nof which is found on pine-trees, is one of the few fungi which may\r\nbe regarded as beneficial to man, since it aids in the destruction\r\nof multitudes of these caterpillars, which otherwise would devour\r\nthe young shoots and pine needles. Giard specialises other parasites\r\nof insects, which he terms Entomophoreæ. Others, _E. rimosa_, attack\r\ngrasshoppers and the diptera, enveloping them in a dense coating of\r\nmycelium and spores, which speedily kills the victim.\r\n\r\nThe study, then, of the life-history of germs, microbes,\r\nmicro-organisms, or bacteria (as they are indifferently termed), opened\r\nup a new science, that of Bacteriology. By the more recent advances\r\nin this science we are enabled to understand the very important part\r\nthese minute organisms fill in the great scheme of Nature, for almost\r\nexclusively by their agency the soil is supplied with the requisite\r\nnutritive material for plant life. And, as already pointed out,\r\nwherever organic matter is present--that is, the dead and useless\r\nsubstances which are the refuse of life--such material is promptly\r\nseized upon by micro-organisms, by means of which histolysis is rapidly\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nBacteria require a power of from 600 to 1,000 diameters or more for\r\nthe determination of the species to which they belong. The number of\r\nspecies has been so much increased of late that a bulky volume is\r\nfound to be insufficient for their enumeration. I am, however, by the\r\ncourtesy of Professor Crookshank, enabled to present my readers with\r\nthe typical forms of thirty-nine species of Bacteria, Schizomycetes, or\r\nfission-fungi, a selection, it will be seen, chiefly taken from among\r\npathogenic organisms--those believed to originate disease. But many of\r\nthe supposed _Saprophytic_ forms often described as originating disease\r\nare merely accidental associates, that is, living in companionship for\r\na time.\r\n\r\n_Size._--In ordinary terms of measurement, bacteria are on an average\r\nfrom 1/25000th to about 1/5000th of an inch long. These measurements\r\ndo not convey a definite impression to the mind. It is calculated that\r\na thousand million of them could be contained in a space of 1/25th of\r\nan inch. The best impression of the size of the bacteria is, perhaps,\r\nobtained when it is stated that a 1/25-inch immersion objective gives a\r\nmagnification of nearly 2,200 diameters, and that under this power the\r\nbacteria appear to be about the size of very small print. The standard\r\nof measurement accepted by bacteriologists is the micro-millimeter.\r\nOne millimeter is equal to about 1/25000th an English inch. The\r\nnumber of micrococci in a milligramme of a culture of _Staphylococcus\r\npyogenes aurens_ has been estimated by Bujwid by counting at eight\r\nthousand millions. Not only do various species differ in dimensions,\r\nbut considerable differences may be noted in a pure culture of the\r\nsame species. On the other hand, there are numerous species which so\r\nclosely resemble each other in size and shape that they cannot be\r\ndifferentiated by microscopic examination alone, and we have to look\r\nto other characteristics, as colour, growth in various culture media,\r\npathogenic power, chemical products, &c., in order to decide the\r\nquestion of identity.\r\n\r\n_Reproduction._--The reproduction of bacteria takes place for the\r\nmost part by fission and by spore formation. _Fission_ is a process\r\nof splitting up or division, whereby an organism divides into two or\r\nmore parts, each of which lives and divides in its turn. If certain\r\norganisms are watched under the microscope, a coccus or bacillus will\r\nbe seen to elongate and at the same time become narrower, until its\r\ntwo halves become free, the two individual organisms again dividing\r\nand subdividing in their turn. This kind of reproduction is more\r\nreadily seen in a higher class of unicellular organisms, the desmids.\r\nIf, however, the new organisms do not break away from each other, but\r\nremain connected in groups or clusters, they are termed Staphylococci;\r\nif they remain connected in the form of a chain, or like a string of\r\nbeads, they are termed Streptococci. If the division takes place in\r\none plane, Diplococci are formed; if in two directions Tetracocci, or\r\nTablet-cocci, are formed. On account of this multiplication by fission,\r\nthe generic name of Schizomycetes, or fission-fungi, has been given to\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n_Spores._--A second method by which bacteria propagate is by spores.\r\nThese bodies are distinguished by their remarkable power of resistance\r\nto the influence of temperature and the action of chemical reagents.\r\nSome of them will resist their immersion in strong acid solutions for\r\nmany hours; also freezing and very high temperatures. Spore formation\r\nmay take place in two ways: firstly, by “endogenous spores” (internal\r\nspores); secondly, by “arthrospores.”\r\n\r\n_Endogenous Spores._--When the formation of the spores takes place in\r\nthe mother-cell, the protoplasm is seen to contract, giving rise to one\r\nor more highly refractive bodies, which are the spores. The enclosing\r\nmembrane of the organism then breaks away, leaving the spores free.\r\n\r\n_Arthrospores._--When the spore is not formed in the parent bacillus,\r\nbut when entire cells (owing to lack of favourable conditions of\r\ngrowth) become converted into spores, the formation is known as\r\n“arthrogenous,” the single individual being called an arthrospore. When\r\nthe conditions are again favourable, spores germinate, giving rise to\r\nnew bacilli. The germinating spore becomes elongated, and loses its\r\nbright appearance, the outer membrane becomes ruptured, and the young\r\nbacillus is set free. Certain conditions, such as the presence of\r\noxygen in the case of the anthrax bacillus, give rise to the formation\r\nof spores; while various kinds of bacteria secure continuous existence\r\nby developing spores when there is lack of proper food material.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the incredible rapidity with which the bacteria\r\nmultiply under conditions favourable to the growth and development,\r\nCohn writes as follows:--“Let us assume that a microbe divides into\r\ntwo within an hour, then again into eight in the third hour, and so\r\non. The number of microbes thus produced in twenty-four hours would\r\nexceed sixteen and a half millions; in two days they would increase to\r\nforty-seven trillions; and in a week the number expressing them would\r\nbe made up of fifty-one figures. At the end of twenty-four hours the\r\nmicrobes descended from a single individual would occupy 1/40th of a\r\nhollow cube, with edges 1/25th of an inch long, but at the end of the\r\nfollowing day would fill a space of twenty-seven cubic inches, and in\r\nless than five days their volume would equal that of the entire ocean.”\r\n\r\nAgain, Cohn estimated that a single bacillus weighs about\r\n0·000,000,000,024,243,672 of a grain; forty thousand millions, 1 grain;\r\n289 billions, 1 pound. After twenty-four hours the descendants from a\r\nsingle bacillus would weigh 1/2666th of a grain; after two days, over\r\na pound; after three days, sixteen and a half million pounds, or 7,366\r\ntons. It is quite unneccessary to state that these figures are purely\r\ntheoretical, and could only be realised if there were no impediment to\r\nsuch rapid increase.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, various checks, such as lack of food and\r\nunfavourable physical conditions, intervene to prevent unmanageable\r\nmultiplication of these bodies.\r\n\r\nThese figures show, however, what a tremendous vital activity\r\nmicro-organisms do possess, and it will be seen later at what great\r\nspeed they increase in water, milk, broth, and other suitable media.\r\n\r\nThe following bacilli, among others, have numerous flagella distributed\r\nover the whole of the organism: the bacillus of blue milk (_Bacillus\r\ncyanogenus_)[52]; the bacillus of malignant œdema; the hay bacillus\r\n(_Bacillus subtilis_); _Proteus vulgaris_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following have only one or two flagella at the poles: the _Bacillus\r\npyocyaneus_, the _Spirillum finkleri_, the _Spirillum choleræ\r\nAsiaticæ_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Spirillum undala_, _Spirillum rubrum_, _Spirillum concentricum_,\r\nand _Sarcinæ_, pocket-cocci, have several flagella.\r\n\r\n_Micrococcus agilis_ have also several flagella; these possibly arise\r\nfrom one point. As I have already pointed out, the _classification_\r\nof the bacteria is one of great difficulty, since new kinds are\r\nbeing constantly discovered, and at present any attempt made in this\r\ndirection can only be considered as quite of a provisional nature.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which stand in the way may be surmised from the fact\r\nthat _Sarcinæ_, pocket-cocci, were originally believed to be a single\r\nspecies, described by me, under the name of _Sarcina ventriculi_, in\r\nthe fourth edition of my book, “as remarkable bodies invading the human\r\nand animal stomach, and seriously interfering with its functions.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.--Sarcinæ.]\r\n\r\nThe original woodcut of these curious parasites is reproduced in\r\nFig. 268, also in Plate IX., No. 7, and which evidently belong to a\r\ndifferent species, numbering thirty-nine altogether. Quite recently\r\nMr. G. H. Broadbent, M.R.C.S., Manchester, sent me a supply of these\r\ninteresting bodies lately discovered by him in an infusion of cow\r\nmanure. On examining a drop with a power of 1500 diameters they were\r\ndiscovered moving over the field of the microscope with a gyrating\r\nmotion by the aid of flagella projecting from each corner of the\r\npocket. After some days, having attained their full growth of four,\r\neight or sixteen in a pocket, they break up, and recommence the\r\nformative process. Sarcinæ are certainly pathogenic in their nature.\r\nCocci in groups, or asso-cocci, are similarly associated. These several\r\nforms of spiro-bacteria are enclosed in a transparent cell-wall, and\r\nare sometimes described as zooglæa.\r\n\r\nOf bacteria the most characteristic groups are bacillus, bacterium, and\r\na species of clostridium, a bottle-shaped bacillus. It is, however,\r\ndifficult to draw a sharp line between so-called _species_.\r\n\r\n_Spiro-bacteria_, or _spirilla_, possess short or long filaments,\r\nrigid or flexible, and their movements are accordingly rotatory, or in\r\nthe long axis of the filaments. These bodies are again divided into\r\ncomma bacilli, or vibrios--a name invented by the older microscopists\r\nwho first described them--some species of which have a flagellate\r\nappendage, to which their movements are due.\r\n\r\n=Anthrax=, =Splenic Fever=, has been long known to be prevalent among\r\ncattle at certain seasons of the year, and is believed to originate\r\nfrom peculiar conditions of climate and soil. This view of splenic\r\nfever on microscopical examination proved an entire fallacy. Bollinger\r\nin 1872 discovered that the blood of the affected animal was still\r\nvirulent after death, owing to the presence of the _spores_ of the\r\nbacillus, and that the soil also became infected and impregnated by\r\nthe disease germs wherever the fever first broke out. In 1877 Dr. Koch\r\nmade a more careful investigation into the source of the disease, and\r\nwas able to give a complete demonstration of the life-history of the\r\nsplenic fever bacillus, and to offer definite proofs of its pathogenic\r\nproperties. He pointed out that the rods grew in the blood and tissues\r\nby lengthening and by cross division. Further, that they not only grew\r\ninto long leptothrix filaments but they produced enormous numbers of\r\nseeds or spores. He watched the fusion of the rods to the formation\r\nof spores and the sprouting of fresh rods. He furthermore inoculated\r\na mouse, watched the effect through several generations, and fully\r\ndemonstrated that in the blood and swollen spleen of the animal the\r\nsame rods were always present. Pasteur and Paul Bret pursued the same\r\ncourse of investigations, which were always followed with precisely\r\nsimilar results. It was, however, principally due to the researches of\r\nKoch that the doctrine of _contagium vivum_ was placed on a scientific\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Koch formulated methods of cultivation, and dictated the\r\nmicroscopical apparatus needful. Furthermore, he furnished postulates\r\nfor proving beyond doubt the existence of specific pathogenic\r\nmicro-organisms.\r\n\r\n“The chain of evidence regarded by Dr. Koch as essential for\r\nproving the existence of a pathogenic organism is as follows:--1.\r\nThe micro-organism must be found in the blood, lymph, or diseased\r\ntissue of man or animal suffering from, or dead of the disease. 2.\r\nThe micro-organism must be isolated from the blood or tissue, and\r\ncultivated in suitable media--_i.e._, outside the animal body. These\r\npure cultivations must be carried on through successive generations of\r\nthe organism. 3. Pure cultivation thus obtained must, when introduced\r\ninto the body of a healthy animal, produce the disease in question. 4.\r\nIn the inoculated animal the same micro-organism must again be found.\r\nThe chain of evidence will be still more complete if, from artificial\r\nculture, a chemical substance is obtained capable of producing the\r\ndisease quite independently of the living organism. It is not enough to\r\nmerely detect, or even artificially cultivate, a bacterium associated\r\nwith disease. An endeavour must be made to establish the exact\r\nrelationship of the bacteria to disease processes. In many instances\r\ndisease bacteria regarded as the actual contagia have been found, on\r\na further searching inquiry, to be entirely misleading. It is almost\r\nneedless to remind the enthusiast that the actual contagion of the\r\ndisease must be fully demonstrated.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.--Micro-Photograph of Typhoid Fever Bacteria.\r\nMagnified 1000 ×.

Magnified 1200\r\n×.]\r\n\r\n_The Plague_ (_Pestis Bacillus_).--The Bombay plague of 1897-98 will\r\never be remembered as one of the most appalling visitations ever\r\nknown. The number of deaths will never be accurately determined,\r\nas the native population, among whom the disease chiefly prevailed\r\nand became so fatal, concealed their dead or carried them away by\r\nnight. The outbreak from the first proved to be most infectious, its\r\nincubation lasting from a few hours to a week only. It prevailed in all\r\nthe over-crowded native quarters of the city. The rats and mice that\r\ninfested the dwellings of the poor were found to be equally susceptible\r\nwith human beings, and these vermin also died by hundreds. Those that\r\nsurvived left their holes and made off, in this way helping to spread\r\nthe infective virus. On examining the bodies of dead rats, they were\r\nfound to have swollen legs, the blood being filled by bacilli and\r\ncurious monads, with whip-like appendages. The bacillus of plague\r\nwas discovered by Kitasato in 1894; it is characterised by short\r\nrods with rounded ends, and a clear space in the middle. The bacilli\r\nstain readily with aniline dyes, and when cultivated on agar, white\r\ntransparent colonies are formed which present an iridescent appearance\r\nwhen examined by reflected light. In addition to the bubonic swellings,\r\nthe neighbouring lymphatic glands were also swollen and blocked by\r\nbacilli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.--Monads in Rat’s Blood, 1,200 ×. (Crookshank.)\r\n\r\n_a_. Monad threading its way among the blood-corpuscles; _b_. Another\r\nwith pendulum movement attached to a corpuscle; _c_. Angular forms;\r\n_d_. Encysted forms; _e_ and _f_. The same seen edgeways.]\r\n\r\nMy illustration (Fig. 270) is from a micro-photograph taken in 1897,\r\nwhen the death rate stood very high. The general distribution of the\r\nbacilli, together with phagocytes and the contents of swollen lymphatic\r\nglands, magnified 1,200 ×, is from a preparation made in hospital. The\r\nmonads from the rat’s blood, 1200 ×, seen threading their way among the\r\nblood corpuscles of a rat, and represented in Fig. 271, are somewhat\r\nlarger than those found in the Bombay rats, but the flagella in the\r\nlatter were quite as marked, while the encysted forms were wholly\r\nabsent and the blood corpuscles less crenated. The white bodies (Fig.\r\n270) were in some preparations, together with the lymphatic bodies,\r\nmore numerous and more swollen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the conditions of life of the bacteria, they may\r\nbe divided broadly into two classes. When the organisms draw\r\ntheir nourishment from some living body or “host,” they are known\r\nas “parasites.” These are further termed “obligate” parasites if\r\nthey exclusively live on their “host.” If the bacteria draw their\r\nnourishment from dead organic matter, they are called “saprophytes.”\r\nThese are also divided into “obligate” and “facultative” saprophytes.\r\nThus it will be apparent that a parasite under certain circumstances\r\nmay readily become a saprophyte.\r\n\r\nSome of the more important saprophytes are those organisms which\r\nplay an important and useful part in our every-day life, such as,\r\nfor instance, in the phenomena associated with fermentation, and\r\nputrefaction agents which transform dead and decomposing organic matter\r\ninto their simpler elements, thus completing the great life cycle,\r\nand rendering the dead and effete matter again ready for the vital\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nAmong other life manifestations of certain bacteria may be mentioned\r\nthose which have the property of generating colouring matter,\r\nthough not chlorophyll. The bacteria themselves are colourless and\r\ntransparent, and the pigment is merely formed as a product of their\r\nmetabolism, especially under the influence of light. Many of the\r\nbacteria give rise to various gases and odours, particularly the\r\nanærobic organisms, which originate those foul putrefactive gases\r\n(ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen, &c.). The blood-rain, _Micrococcus\r\nprodigiosus_, gives off an odour resembling trimethylamin.\r\nMicro-organisms have the property of producing various changes in the\r\nmedium on which they are grown. In many cases albuminous bodies are\r\npeptonized and gelatine is liquefied. Many bacteria have the faculty of\r\nresolving organic bodies into their simplest elements; others, again,\r\nhave the property of converting ammonia into nitric and nitrous acid.\r\nCertain microbes have the property of becoming phosphorescent in the\r\ndark. These phosphorescent bacteria are often seen on decaying plants\r\nand wood; sometimes in tropical climates the sea becomes luminous owing\r\nto the presence of countless numbers of these organisms. Again, they\r\nare frequently seen on the surface of dead fish, particularly mackerel,\r\nwhich often become so bright as to strongly illuminate the cupboard in\r\nwhich they lie.\r\n\r\nThe particular class of fungi that produce disease in man and the\r\nhigher animals are generally known as “pathogenic.” These pathogenic\r\norganisms may exert their pernicious power in several ways. They\r\nmay be injurious on account of their abstracting nourishment from\r\nthe blood or tissues, or for the purely mechanical reason of their\r\nstopping up the minute capillaries and blood-vessels by their excessive\r\nmultiplication. But the poisonous action of most of the pathogenic\r\nbacteria is due to the chemical products secreted by the organisms,\r\nand it is to the circulation and absorption within the body of these\r\npoisons that the disturbances of the animal system, which characterise\r\ndisease, decay, and dissolution of every organism, must be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nParasitic Diseases of Plants.\r\n\r\nThe subject of fungoid diseases and fungus epidemics are of worldwide\r\ninterest, if only because of the annual losses to agriculturists from\r\nparasitic diseases of plants, amounting to millions of pounds sterling.\r\nThe history of wheat-rust, and that of oats and rye, each equally\r\nsusceptible to the ravages of the same Rufus, can be traced back to\r\nGenesis. A description of it was given in 1805 by Sir Joseph Banks. He\r\nsuggested that the germs entered the stomata, and he warned farmers\r\nagainst the use of _rusted_ litter, and made important experiments on\r\nthe sowing of rusted wheat-grains. A great discussion on the barberry\r\nquestion followed, Fries particularly insisting on the difference\r\nbetween _Æcidium berberidis_ and _Puccinia graminis_. Tulasne confirmed\r\nthe statement made by Henslow that the uredo and puccinia stages belong\r\nto the same fungus, and are not mixed species. De Bary’s investigations\r\nin 1860-64 proved that the _sporidia_ of some Uredinieæ (_e.g._,\r\n_Coleosporium_) will not infect the plant which bears the spores, and\r\nthat the æcidia of certain other forms are stages in the life-history\r\nof species of Uromyces and Puccinia. Furthermore, De Bary in 1864\r\nattacked the question of wheat rust, and by means of numerous sowings\r\nof the telentospores on barberry proved that they bring about the\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThis led to the discovery of the phenomenon of _Heterœcism_\r\n(colonisation), introducing a new idea, and clearing up many\r\ndifficulties. In 1890 the rust question entered on a new phase: it was\r\ntaken up by men of science all over the world, and active inquiries\r\nwere set on foot. The result has been the confirmation of De Bary’s\r\nresults, but with the further discovery that our four common cereals\r\nare attacked by no less than ten different forms of rust belonging to\r\nfive separate species or “form species,” and with several physiological\r\nvarieties, capable of turning the table upon the barberry by infecting\r\nit. Some of these are found to be strictly confined to one or other of\r\nthe four common cereals, infecting two or more of them, while others\r\ncan infect various kinds of our common wild grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.--_Puccinia_, displaying _uredospores_ and\r\n_telentospores_.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Aregma speciosum_; _b._ _Xenodochus paradoxus_; _c._ _P.\r\nAmorphæ_; _d._ _Triphœmium dubens_; _e._ Younger spores; _f._ _P.\r\nlateripes_; magnified 450 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that what has usually gone by the name of _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_ is an aggregate of several species, and that varietal forms\r\nof this exist so especially adapted to the host, that, although no\r\nmorphical differences can be detected between them, they cannot be\r\ntransferred from one cereal to another, pointing to physiological\r\nvariations of a kind met with among bacteria and yeasts, but hitherto\r\nunsuspected in these higher parasitic fungi. It now appears we must be\r\nprepared for similar specialisation of varietal forms among Ustilagineæ\r\nas well as among Uredineæ.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has been found that different sorts of wheat, oats,\r\nbarley, and rye are susceptible to their particular rusts in different\r\ndegrees, at the bottom of which, it is suggested, there must be some\r\ncomplex physiological causes. De Bary gave proof, in 1886, that Peziza\r\n(Plate I., Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6) succeeds in becoming parasitic only after\r\n_saprophytic_ culture to a strong mycelium, and that its form is\r\naltered thereby--probably by the excretion of a poison. Professor\r\nMarshall Ward showed that similar results took place in the case of the\r\nlily disease. Reinhardt, in 1892, showed that the apical growth of a\r\npeziza is disturbed and interrupted if the culture solution is employed\r\nconcentrated; and Büsgen, in 1893, showed that _Botrytis cinerea_\r\nexcretes poison at the tips of the hyphæ, thus confirming Professor\r\nWard’s results with the lily disease in 1888, and of later years, that\r\na similar excretion occurs in rust-fungus. He further found that the\r\nwater contents of the infected plant exercises an influence, as in the\r\ncase of _Botrytis_ attacking chrysanthemums and other plants in the\r\nautumn, and that cold increases the germinating capacity of the spores.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer, in his work on “_Chemotaxis_,” shows that bacteria will\r\ncongregate in the neighbourhood of an algal cell evolving oxygen. He\r\nalso found that many motile antherozoids, zoospores, bacteria, &c.,\r\nwhen free to move in a liquid, are attracted towards a point whence\r\na given chemical substance is diffusing. He was concerning himself\r\nless with the evolution of oxygen or movements of bacteria than with\r\na fundamental question of stimulation to movement in general. He\r\nfound the attractive power of different chemical substances vary with\r\nthe organism, and that various other bodies beside oxygen attract\r\nbacteria--peptone, dextrose, potassium salts, &c.; that swarm spores\r\nof the fungus _Saprolegnia_ are powerfully attracted towards the\r\nmuscles of a fly’s leg placed in the water in which they are swimming\r\nabout; also, that in many cases where the hyphæ of fungi suddenly and\r\nsharply bend out of their original course to enter the body of a plant\r\nor animal, the cause of the bending lies in a powerful chemotropic\r\naction, due to the attraction of some substance escaping from the body.\r\nProfessor Ward has seen zoospores of a _Pythium_ suddenly dart out on\r\nto the cut surface of a bean-stem, and there fix themselves.\r\n\r\nThis will be better understood by referring to the course pursued by\r\nthese bodies generally. When the spore of a parasitic fungus settles\r\non a plant, it frequently behaves as follows:--The spore germinates\r\nand forms a slender tube of delicate consistency, blunt at the end,\r\nand containing colourless protoplasm, as shown, highly magnified in\r\nFig. 272, and in Figs. 273 and 274 much less magnified. De Bary long\r\nago showed that such a tube--the germinal-hypha--only grows for a\r\nshort time along the surface of the organ, and its tip soon bends down\r\nand enters the plant, either through one of the stomata or by boring\r\nits way directly through the cell-walls. Professor Ward says these\r\nphenomena suggested to himself that the end of the tube is attracted in\r\nsome way, and by some force which brings its tip out of the previous\r\ndirection, and De Bary has suggested that this attraction is due to\r\nsome chemical substance excreted by the host plant. It is remarkable\r\nwith what ease the tube penetrates the cell-walls, and which Ward\r\nbelieves to be due to the solvent action of an enzyme, capable of\r\ndissolving cellulose.\r\n\r\n“Miyoshi carried these observations a step further when, in 1894,\r\nhe showed that if a leaf is injected with a substance such as\r\nammonium-chloride, dextrine, or cane-sugar (all substances capable\r\nof exerting chemotropic attraction on fungus-hyphæ), and spores of a\r\nfungus which is _not parasitic_ are then sown on it, the hyphæ of the\r\nfungus penetrate the stomata and behave exactly as if the fungus were a\r\ntrue parasite.\r\n\r\n“So surprising a result lets in a flood of light on many known cases\r\nof fungi, which are, as a rule, _non_-parasitic, becoming so, in fact,\r\nonly when the host plant is in an abnormal condition, _e.g._, the entry\r\nof species of Botrytis into living tissues when the weather is cold\r\nand damp and the light dull; the entry of Mucor into various fruits,\r\ntomatoes, apples, pears, &c., when the hyphæ meet with a slight crack\r\nor wound, through which the juices are exposed. It is exceedingly\r\nprobable that the rapid infection of potato leaves in damp weather in\r\nJuly is traceable not merely to the favouring effect of the moisture on\r\nthe fungus, but that the state of super-saturation of the cell-walls\r\nof the potato leaf--the tissues of which are now unduly filled with\r\nwater and dissolved sugars, &c., owing to the dull light and diminished\r\ntranspiration--is the primary factor which determines the easy victory\r\nof the parasite, and, as Professor Ward suggested some time ago, that\r\nthe suppressed life of Ustilagineæ in the stems of grasses is due to\r\nthe want of particular carbo-hydrates in the vegetative tissues, but\r\nwhich are present in the grain. A year later Miyoshi carried proof to\r\ndemonstration, and showed that a fungus-hypha is actually so attracted\r\nby substances on the other side of a membrane, and that its tip pierces\r\nthe latter; for the hyphæ were made to grow through films of artificial\r\ncellulose, of collodion, of cellulose impregnated with paraffin, of\r\nparchment paper, and even the chitinous coat of an insect, simply by\r\nplacing the intact films on gelatine impregnated with the attracting\r\nsubstance, and laying the spores on the opposite side of the membrane.\r\n\r\n“Now this is obviously a point of the highest importance in the theory\r\nof parasitism and parasitic diseases, because it suggests at once\r\nthat in the varying conditions of the cells, the contents of which\r\nare separated only by membranous walls from the fungus-hyphæ, whose\r\nentrance means ruin and destruction, there may be found circumstances\r\nwhich sometimes favour and sometimes disfavour the entrance of the\r\nhyphæ; and it is, at least, a remarkable fact that some of the\r\nsubstances which experiments prove to be highly attractive to such\r\nhyphæ--_e.g._, sugars, the sap of plums, phosphates, nitrates, &c.--are\r\njust the substances found in plants; and the discovery that the action\r\ndepends upon the nature of the substance as well as on the kind of\r\nfungus, and is affected by its concentration, the temperature, and\r\nother circumstances, only confirms us in this idea.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is one other fact which it is important to notice,\r\nviz., that there are substances which repel instead of attract the\r\nhyphæ. Is it not, then, asks Professor Ward, natural to conclude\r\nthat the differences in behaviour of different parasites towards\r\ndifferent host-plants, and towards the same host-plant under different\r\nconditions, probably depend on the chemotropic irritability of the\r\nhyphæ towards the substance formed in the cells on the other side of\r\nthe membranous cell-walls? And when, as often happens, the effusion of\r\nsubstances, such as the cells contain, to the exterior is facilitated\r\nby over-distension and super-saturation, or by actual wounds, we cannot\r\nbe surprised at the consequences when a fungus, hitherto unable to\r\nenter the plant, suddenly does so. To this proposition my answer is\r\nemphatically in the affirmative, since in my investigations into the\r\n“fungus-foot disease” (“_Mycetoma_”), 1871, of India, the entry of the\r\nfungus was in almost every case shown to be through an abrasion of\r\nthe skin or a direct open wound; the majority of the cases reported\r\nwere among the agricultural classes. When, then, as often happens, the\r\neffusion of substances, such as the cells contain, to the exterior\r\nis facilitated by over-distension and super-saturation, or by actual\r\nwounds, we cannot be surprised at the consequences when a fungus,\r\nhitherto unable to enter the plant, suddenly does so. Nevertheless,\r\nit must be admitted that the knowledge gained of parasites does not\r\nsatisfactorily account for epidemic visitations over large areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nHabitat of Fungi and Moulds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.--Fungi and Moulds.\r\n\r\nDescription of Figures.--_a._ Fungi Spores, taken in a sick chamber;\r\n_b._ _Aspergillus glaucus_; _c._ Yeast, recent state; _d._ Exhausted\r\nyeast, budding; _e._ Penicillium spores more highly magnified; _g._\r\nAerobic spores and mould mycelium; _h._ Aspergillus spore, grown on\r\nmelon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHabitat, Specialised Forms of Parasites.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--The habitat of vegetable parasitic fungi is extremely\r\nvariable. Fungi are found everywhere, living and flourishing on all\r\nthe families of the vegetable and animal kingdoms. They attack our\r\nhouses, foods, clothes, utensils of every kind, wall papers and\r\nbooks, the paste of which, to my astonishment, affords a sufficient\r\nsupply of nourishment. Members of the parasitic tribe of bacteria, by\r\na combined effort of countless myriads, have given rise to a sense\r\nof supernatural agency. _Bacillus prodigiosus_, described also as\r\n_Palmella mirifica_ and _Zoogalactina imetropia_, from its attacking\r\nmilk and other alimentary substances, the spores of which are often of\r\na deep red colour, have been found to cover whole tracts of country\r\nin a single night with what is called a “_gory dew_,” changing in\r\ndaylight to a deep green colour. This was at one time regarded with\r\nsuperstitious awe as a miracle, as it has been known to attack bread\r\nand even the sacred wafer, and which in mediæval ages was described as\r\nthe “bleeding-host.” This parasitic plant belongs to anærobic bacteria,\r\nand is only developed in the dark. The nitrogen required for nutrition\r\nmust be derived from the air. An algal form gives rise to the red scum\r\nseen in ponds and reservoirs in the autumn. The discharge from wounds\r\nis coloured blue by _Bacterium pyocyanine_. There are many other forms,\r\nsome of which have an orange colour, and the genus is recognised as\r\n“_chromogenic microbes_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.--Fungi and Moulds.\r\n\r\nDescription of Figures.--_d._ _Puccinia graminis_ on wheat; _c._\r\nPolycystis spore of rye-smut; _f._ Alder fungus spores, _Microspheria\r\npenicellula_; _g._ _Dactylium roseum_, rose-coloured mould; _h._\r\n_Verticillium distans_, whorled mould found on herbaceous plants; _i._\r\n_Botrytis_, vine and lily fungus; _j, j′._ _Peronospora infestans_,\r\npotato fungus; _k._ _P. gangliformis_, mould of herbaceous plants; _l._\r\nVarious _Penicillium_ and other spores taken in a bean-field.]\r\n\r\nA cryptogam belonging to anærobic bacteria, described as _Protococcus\r\ninvalis_, on being set aside in a bottle, and a little rain water\r\nadded, was seen to set up spontaneous fermentation, and in a very short\r\ntime exhibited remarkable activity. The colour of the infusion changed,\r\nit assumed a delicate pink hue in direct light, which deepened to a\r\nred in reflected light. The fluid contents were now observed to be\r\ndichoric, and the spectroscopic appearance subsequently presented was\r\none of much interest. The spectrum was a well-marked one, and might be\r\ntaken to determine the presence of a nitrogenous element or of glucose.\r\n\r\nAmong all the various plants known to suffer from the attacks of\r\nparasites, the vine has been the greatest sufferer. The oïdium, or\r\n_Erysiphe Tuckeri_, so called from the name of the discoverer by whom\r\nit was first described, has been longest known to the vine grower.\r\nThis really belongs to the group Ascomycetes, and appears to have been\r\nbrought from America in 1845, whence it was passed on to France, where\r\nit soon threatened to entirely destroy the vineyards. This was followed\r\nby another parasite, belonging in this instance to the animal kingdom,\r\n_Phylloxera vastatrix_. This oïdium appears on the grape in the form of\r\ngreyish filaments, terminating in an enlarged head, which contains an\r\nagglomeration of spores, not free or in a chaplet, as in Aspergillus\r\n(Fig. 273). These spores when ripe burst from the capsule as fine dust,\r\nand are diffused by the air in all directions, thus spreading the\r\ndisease far and away. Another of the parasitic moulds, _Peronospora\r\nviticola_, is a kind of mildew, differing from oïdium. The hyphæ\r\npenetrate more deeply than that of oïdium. On the upper surface of the\r\nleaf brown patches appear; these branch out and ramify as seen in the\r\npotato-fungus, _P. infestans_ (Fig. 274). The parasite destroys the\r\ntissue of the leaf, and it withers and dies. There are other well-known\r\nparasites, the black-rot, _Phomauvicola_, belonging to the Ascomycetes.\r\nThis appears in early shoots in the form of round black spots, and\r\ngradually spreads over leaves and young fruit. This same rot, one year,\r\ndevastated the American vineyards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.--Fungi, Moulds.\r\n\r\n_a._ Clustered Spores, _Gonatobotrys simplex_; _b._ Spore of _Puccinia\r\ncoronata_, the mildew of grapes; _c._ Barley smut; _d._ _Puccinia\r\nalthæa_; _e._ _Penicillium glaucum_; _m._ _Ixodes farinæ_, found in\r\ndamaged flour together with smut.]\r\n\r\nCereals, wheats and grasses, suffer from other well-known forms of\r\nmicroscopic fungi termed _rusts_ and _smuts_, which cover the blades\r\nor infect the full ear of the fruit. The name given indicates their\r\ncolour, and these belong, for the most part, to the genus Uredo and\r\nthe family of the Basidiomycetes. They have no endogenous spores but\r\nas many as four forms of exogenous. This is also the case with wheat\r\nand barley, whereby they are distinguished as _Uredo_ or _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_ (see Figs. 273 and 274, and Plate I., Nos. 19 and 22,\r\n_Æcidium berberidis_). For a long time it was believed that _Uredo\r\nlinearis_ and _Puccinia graminis_ were so many distinct species, but\r\nit is now known that there are only three successive phases of the\r\ndevelopmental stages of a single species--that, as a matter of fact,\r\npuccinia presents the phenomenon of alternation of generations, that\r\nis, that the complete development of the fungus is only effected by\r\nits transference from one plant to another. Other uredines, Ustilago\r\nand Tilletia smuts, are more apt to affect the ears of wheat, rye, and\r\nother grasses than puccinia. Bread made from wheat affected by smut\r\nhas an acrid and bitter taste, while that made from rye flour often\r\nproduces a serious form of disease. The propagation of either, then,\r\nshould be stopped as quickly as possible by destroying all barberry\r\nbushes growing near or within the vicinity of corn fields, and by other\r\nmeans. The ergot of rye is due to distinct species of fungi having\r\nendogenous spores enclosed in a sac or _ascus_, hence the name of the\r\nfamily, Ascomycetes or _Tuberaceæ_, which are reproduced by the spores\r\ncontained in these asci. Truffles belong to this family. But other\r\nmembers of the same family have several forms of spores, and these\r\nagain present us with the phenomenon of alternation of generations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.--Fungi, Moulds.\r\n\r\n_p._ Spores of _Tilletia caries_; _q._ Spores of _Tilletia caries_,\r\nwhen germinating, produce a fœtid olive-coloured spore in cereal\r\ngrains; _r._ Telentospores of _Puccinia graminis_; _s._ _Crystopus\r\ncandidus_, spores growing in chains; _t._ _Petronospora infestans_,\r\nmildew of turnips, &c.; _u._ A transverse section of ergot of rye,\r\nshowing spores in masses; _v._ _Claviceps purpuræ_, associated with\r\nergoted rye.]\r\n\r\nErgot of rye is used in medicine, but if not used with care it will\r\nproduce a dangerous disease. This parasitic fungi consists of minute\r\nmicroscopic masses of spores, which cover the young flower of the\r\nrye with a white flocculent mass, formerly termed _sphacelium_. The\r\nmycelium formed spreads over the ear of corn in thick felt-like masses,\r\ntermed _sclerotis_. The sphacelium changes its form in the following\r\nspring. Other changes are brought about, and it seems to pass through a\r\ncycle of alternations of generations.\r\n\r\nBread made from rye so infested is known to produce grave consequences,\r\nsoon to become fatal if not detected in time. The disease is termed\r\nergotism, and gangrene of the extremities takes place among people\r\nof the north of France and Russia, who consume bread made from rye\r\nflour. Ergot of maize will also cause similar diseases. Fowls and\r\nother animals fed upon this cereal become in a short time poisoned,\r\nand the cause of death is not rightly suspected. There is another\r\nfungus belonging to the same group of Ascomycetes, known as _Eurotium\r\nrepens_, which appears upon leather when left in a damp place, and also\r\nupon vegetable or animal substances if badly preserved, and gradually\r\ndestroys it. This mould is of a darkish green colour.\r\n\r\nThe minute spores display themselves as rows of beads when fully ripe\r\non the erect mycelium. _Aspergillus glaucus_ represents the white\r\nexogenous spores of the sphacelium of the ergot of rye; and those\r\nsubsequently produced in the yellow balls correspond with the asci\r\ndeveloped in sclerotis, the endogenous species. Many of the parasitic\r\nspecies belonging to the genera _Erysiphe_, _Sphæria_, _Sordaria_,\r\n_Penicillium_, &c., have a similar mode of propagation, and affect a\r\nlarge number of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nParasitic Fungi of Men and Animals.\r\n\r\nIn the microscopical examinations especially given to the elucidation\r\nof parasitic diseases of the skin, previously referred to, I discovered\r\nmore varieties of spores and filaments of certain cryptogamic plants\r\nassociated with a larger number of specific forms of fungi than any\r\nprevious observer. I did not, however, feel justified in concluding,\r\nwith Küchenmeister, Schœnlein, and Robin, that these fungoid growths\r\nwere the primary cause of the diseases referred to. Indeed, the\r\nforemost dermatologists of the period utterly refused to entertain\r\nthe specific germ theory of the German investigators. Nevertheless, I\r\ncontended, “the universality of their distribution is in itself a fact\r\nof very considerable importance, and one pointing to the belief that\r\nthey are scavengers ever ready to fasten on decaying matter, and, on\r\nfinding a suitable soil, spread out their invisible filaments in every\r\ndirection in so persistent a manner as to arrest growth and overwhelm\r\nthe plant in destruction.”[53]\r\n\r\nSpecial forms of fungi are given in Plate I., Nos. 10-14, and those of\r\nthe ascomycetes in Nos. 17-21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.--Healthy fresh Yeast, from a large Brewery, in\r\nan active stage of formation, × 400.]\r\n\r\n_Oïdium albicans_ affects both animals and plants. It often attacks\r\nthe mucous membrane of the mouths of young children. The spores become\r\nelongated and converted into hyphæ, and ramify about in all directions,\r\nproducing a troublesome form of disease. This parasitic fungus is\r\nbetter known under another name, _Saccharomyces mycoderma_. Oïdium\r\nresemble algæ in their mode of life, as they are mostly found in a\r\nliquid media. The structure of all ferments is very simple: each plant\r\nis composed of a single cell, either of a spherical, elliptical, or\r\ncylindrical form, varying in size, and filled with protoplasmic and\r\nnucleated matter. This grows, and is seen to bud out and divide into\r\ntwo or more parts, all resembling the mother cell.\r\n\r\nFig. 277 represents the healthy cells of yeast, _Saccharomyces\r\ncerevisiæ_, freshly taken from a brewer’s vat, and in an active stage\r\nof growth. The mode of multiplication continues as long as the plant\r\nremains in a liquid favourable to its nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe changes from one stage to another are rapid, as will be noticed on\r\nreference to the consecutive formative processes the cells are known to\r\npass through, Fig. 278 (1859).\r\n\r\nIf the development of the plant is arrested by want of a saccharine\r\nor nitrogenous substance, and the liquid dries up, the protoplasm\r\ncontained in the cell contracts, and the spores, or endogenous\r\nreproductive organs, of the plant will remain in a state of rest,\r\nbecome perfectly dry, and yet retain life. They are not easily killed,\r\neven when subjected to a very high or low temperature, they do not lose\r\nthe power of germination when favourable conditions present themselves,\r\nand at once take on a new birth.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many other ferments besides that of beer-yeasts,\r\nsuch as alcoholic and wine ferments, the commonest of which, according\r\nto Pasteur, is _Saccharomyces ellipsoideus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.--Development of Yeast Cells.\r\n\r\n1. When first taken; 2. One hour after introducing a few cells into\r\nsweet-wort; 3. Three hours after; 4. Eight hours; 5. Forty-eight hours,\r\nwhen the cells become elongated.]\r\n\r\nBut yeast-fungi and mould-fungi, like bacteria or fission-fungi, are\r\nmicro-organisms, belonging to two specific orders, the Saccharomycetes\r\nand the Hyphomycetes, which are intimately related to each other, but\r\nquite distinct from bacteria. Their germs occur widely distributed in\r\nair, soil, and water. Many species are of hygienic, while others are\r\nof pathological interest and importance in being either accidentally\r\nassociated with, or the cause of, disease processes, while others\r\nare fermentations of very essential service in various industrial\r\nprocesses. The making of beers, wines, and spirits, as we understand\r\nthem, constitutes but a small part of the province of fermentation.\r\nThe life activities of ferments open out a study of vast importance\r\nto mankind, and while they have only been regarded in their worst\r\naspect--that of a bane--they are, nevertheless, a boon to mankind.\r\nThe first clear view we obtained of this was that of Reess, who in\r\n1870 showed there were several species or forms of the yeast-fungus.\r\nHansen followed up this discovery in 1883, and, taking advantage of the\r\nstrict methods of culture introduced by bacteriologists, found that by\r\ncultivating yeast on a solid media from a single spore it was quite\r\npossible to obtain constant types of pure yeasts, each possessing its\r\nown peculiar properties. One consequence of Hansen’s labours was that\r\nit now became possible for every brewer to work with a yeast of uniform\r\ntype instead of with haphazard mixtures, in which serious disease\r\nforms might predominate and injure the beer. Among other things made\r\nclear was that a true yeast may have a mycelial stage of development.\r\nFurthermore, there is the influence exercised by the nucleus of\r\nthe yeast cell. Many other points of interest arose out of these\r\ninvestigations; one was, that many higher fungi can assume a yeast-like\r\nstage of development if submerged in fluids, as, for instance, various\r\nspecies of Mucor, Ustilago, Exoascus, and numerous others. Ascomycetes,\r\nand Basidiomycetes as well, are known to form budding cells, and it was\r\nthought that the yeasts of alcoholic fermentation are merely reduced\r\nforms of these higher fungi, which have become habituated to the\r\nbudding condition--a conclusion supported by Hansen’s discovery that a\r\ntrue Saccharomyces can develop a feeble, but a true, mycelium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.--Saccharomyces and Moulds.\r\n\r\n1. Section from a tomato, showing spores growing from cuticle; 2.\r\nPortion detached to show budding-out process; 3. Lateral view of spore\r\nsac with oospores issuing forth; 4. Apiculated ferment spores; 6 and 7.\r\n_Mycoderma cerivisiæ_ in different stages of growth, as seen on wine\r\nbottles; 8 and 9. _Torulæ diabeticæ_, torulæ and fission spores.]\r\n\r\n“This view has been entirely confirmed by an inquiry into the mode of\r\nbrewing _saké_ by the Japanese, by the aid of the Aspergillus fungus.\r\nFurther researches established the fact that other forms of fungi,\r\n_e.g._, those on the surface of fruits, developed endogenous spores,\r\nwhich cause alcoholic fermentation. More recently, and by further\r\nexperimental inquiry, partly by pure cultures of separate forms, and\r\npartly by well-devised cultures on ripening fruits still attached to\r\nthe plant but imprisoned in sterilised glass vessels, it has been found\r\nthat yeast and moulds are separate forms, not genetically connected,\r\nbut merely associated in nature, as are so many other forms of yeasts,\r\nbacteria, and moulds. Further, Hansen has discovered that several\r\nyeasts furnish quite distinct races or varieties in different breweries\r\nin various parts of the world, so that we cannot avoid the conclusion\r\nthat their race characteristics have been impressed on the cells by the\r\ncontinued action of the conditions of culture to which they have so\r\nlong been exposed--they are, in fact, domesticated races.”\r\n\r\nThe environments of yeasts are peculiar. Sauer found that a given\r\nvariety of yeast, whose activity is normally inhibited when the\r\nalcohol attains a certain degree of concentration in the liquid, can\r\nbe induced to go on fermenting until a higher degree is attained by\r\nthe addition of a certain lactic acid bacterium. The latter, indeed,\r\nappears to prepare the way for the yeast. It has been shown, also, that\r\ndamage may be done to beers and wines by allowing plant germs to gain\r\naccess with the yeast; there are, too, several forms of yeast that are\r\ninimical to the action of the required fermentation. Other researches\r\nshow that associated yeasts may ferment better than any single yeast,\r\nand such symbiotic action of two yeasts of high fermenting power has\r\ngiven better results than either alone. English ginger-beer furnishes a\r\ncurious symbiotic association of two organisms--a true yeast and a true\r\nbacterium--so closely united that the yeast cells become imprisoned\r\nin the gelatinous meshes of the bacterium; and it is a curious fact\r\nthat this symbiotic union of yeast and bacterium ferments is far more\r\nenergetic than either when used alone, and the product is different,\r\nlarge quantities of lactic and carbonic acids being formed, and little\r\nor no alcohol.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I gave an account of similar curious symbiotic results\r\nobtained by introducing into a wort-infusion a small proportion of\r\n_German yeast_, an artificial product composed of honey, malt, and a\r\ncertain proportion of spontaneously-fermented wheat flour. This, to\r\nmy astonishment, produced ten per cent. more alcohol than any of its\r\ncongeners, and did not so soon exhaust itself as brewer’s yeast.[54]\r\n\r\nIn the hephir used in Europe for fermenting milk, another symbiotic\r\nassociation of yeast and a bacterium, it is seen that in this process\r\nno less than four distinct organisms are concerned. I have already\r\ninstanced the fermentation of rice to produce saké, which is first\r\nacted upon by an Aspergillus that converts the starch into sugar and\r\nan associated yeast, and this is also shown to be a distinct fungus,\r\nsymbiotically associated in the conversion. “Starting, then, from\r\nthe fact that the constitution of the medium profoundly affects the\r\nphysiological action of the fungus, there can be nothing surprising\r\nin the discovery that the fungus is more active in a medium which\r\nhas been favourably altered by an associated organism, whether the\r\nlatter aids the fungus by directly altering the medium, or by ridding\r\nit of products of excretion, or by adding gaseous or other body. It\r\nis not difficult to see, then, that natural selection will aid in\r\nthe perpetuation of the symbiosis, and in cases like that of the\r\nginger-beer plant it is extremely difficult to get the two organisms\r\napart, a difficulty similar to that in the case of the soredia of\r\nlichens.”\r\n\r\nBuchner discovered that by means of extreme pressure a something\r\ncan be extracted from yeast which at once decomposes sugar into\r\nalcohol and carbon-dioxide. This something is regarded as a kind of\r\nincomplete protoplasm--a body, as we have already seen, composed of\r\nproteid--and in a structural condition somewhere between that of true\r\nsoluble enzymes like invertin and a complete living protoplasm. This\r\nreminds me of an older experiment of mine, the immediate conversion\r\nof cane-sugar into grape-sugar. If we take two parts of white sugar\r\nand rub it up in a mortar with one part of a perfectly dry solid, the\r\nGerman yeast before spoken of, it is immediately transformed as if by\r\nmagic into a flowing liquid mass--a syrup. This process of forming\r\n“invert sugar” can be watched under the microscope; the liberation of\r\ncarbonic acid gas in large bubbles is seen to go on simultaneously with\r\nthe assimilation of the dextrose, and the breaking up of the crystals\r\nof sugar; the cell at the same time increasing in size as well as in\r\nrefractive power; a curious state of activity appears to be going on in\r\nthe small mass, which is very interesting to watch throughout.\r\n\r\nHowever, the enzymes of Buchner are probably bits off the protoplasm,\r\nas it were, and so the essentials of the theory of fermentation remain,\r\nthe immediate agent being not that of protoplasm itself, but of\r\nsomething made by or broken off from it. Enzymes, or similar bodies,\r\nare known to be very common in plants, and the suspicion that fungi do\r\nmuch work with their aid is abundantly confirmed. It seems, indeed,\r\nthat there are a whole series of these bodies which have the power of\r\ncarrying over oxygen to other bodies, and so bringing about oxidations\r\nof a peculiar character. These curious enzymes were first observed\r\nowing to studies on the changes which wine and plant juice undergo when\r\nexposed to the action of the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nThe browning of cut apples is known to be due to the action of an\r\noxydase, that is, an oxygen carrying ferment, and the same is claimed\r\nfor the deep colouring of certain lacs obtained from the juice of\r\nplants, such as Anacardiaceæ, which are pale and transparent when\r\nfresh drawn, but which gradually darken in colour on exposure to the\r\nair. Oxydases have been isolated from beets, dahlia, potato-tubers,\r\nand several other plants. This fact explains a phenomenon known to\r\nbotanists, and partly explained by Schönbein as far back as 1868, that\r\nif certain fungi (_e.g._, _Boletus beridies_) are broken or bruised,\r\nthe yellow or white flesh at once turns blue; this action is now traced\r\nto the presence in the cell sap of an oxydase.\r\n\r\nIt is the diastatic activity of Aspergillus which is utilised in the\r\nmaking of saké from rice, and in the preparation of soy from the soja\r\nbean in Japan. Katz has recently tested the diastatic activity of\r\nAspergillus, of Penicillium, and of _Bacterium megatherium_, in the\r\npresence of large and small quantities of sugar, and found all are able\r\nto produce not only diastase, but also other enzymes; as the sugar\r\naccumulates the diastase formed diminishes, whereas the accumulation of\r\nother carbo-hydrates produces no such effect. Harting’s investigation\r\non the destruction of timber by fungi derives new interest from the\r\ndiscovery of an emulsion-like enzyme in many such wood-destroying\r\nforms, which splits up glucosides, amygdalin, and other substances into\r\nsugar, and that hyphæ feed on other carbo-hydrates. The fact, also,\r\nthat Aspergillus can form inverts of the sucrase and maltase types,\r\nas well as emulsin, inulate, and diastase, according to circumstances\r\nof nutrition, will explain why this fungus can grow on almost any\r\norganic substance it may happen to alight upon. The secretion of\r\nspecial enzymes by fungi has a further interest just now, for recent\r\ninvestigations promise to bring us much nearer to an understanding of\r\nthe phenomena of parasitism than it was possible when I was at work\r\nupon them some forty or fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was De Bary who impelled botanists to abandon older methods, and he\r\nwho laid the foundation of modern mycology. Later on he pointed out\r\nthat when the infecting germinal tube of a fungus enters a plant-cell,\r\ntwo phenomena must be taken into account, the penetration of the\r\ncell-walls and tissues, and the attraction which causes the tips of\r\nthe growing hypha to face and penetrate these obstacles, instead of\r\ngliding over them in the lines of apparent least resistance. The\r\nfurther development of these two factors shows that in the successful\r\nattack of a parasitic plant on its victim or host these fungi can\r\nexcrete cellulose-dissolving enzymes, and that they have the power of\r\ndestroying lignine. Zopf has also furnished examples of fungi which\r\ncan consume fats. There is, however, one other connection in which\r\nthese observations on enzymes in the plant-cell promise to be of\r\nconsiderable importance, viz., the remarkable action of certain rays of\r\nthe solar light on bacteria. It has been known for some time past that\r\nif bacteria in a nutrient liquid are exposed to sunlight they quickly\r\ndie. The further researches of Professor Marshall Ward and other\r\nworkers in the same direction have brought out the fact that it is\r\nreally the light rays, and not high temperatures, that it is especially\r\nthe blue-violet and ultra-violet rays, which exert the most effective\r\nbactericidal action. This proof depended upon the production of actual\r\nphotographs in bacteria of the spectrum itself. Apart from this, the\r\nProfessor demonstrated that just such spores as those of anthrax, at\r\nthe same time pathogenic and highly resistant to heat, succumb soonest\r\nto the action of these cold light-rays, and that under conditions\r\nwhich preclude their being poisoned by a liquid bath. It is in all\r\nprobability the action of these rays of light upon the enzymes, which\r\nabound in the bacterial cells, that bring about their death.\r\n\r\nThe sun, then, is seen to be our most powerful scavenger, and this\r\napparently receives confirmation in connection with Martinaud’s\r\nobservations, that the yeasts necessary for wine-making are deficient\r\nin numbers and power on grapes exposed to intense light, and to this is\r\ndue that better results are obtained in central France as contrasted\r\nwith those in the south. “When we reflect, then, that the nature of\r\nparasitic fungi, the actual demonstration of infection by a fungus\r\nspore, the transmission of germs by water and air, the meaning and\r\nsignificance of polymorphism, heteræcism, symbiosis, had already been\r\nrendered clear in the case of fungi, and that it was by these studies\r\nin fermentation, and in the life-history of the fungus Saccharomyces,\r\nthat the way was prepared for the ætiology of bacterial diseases in\r\nanimals, there should be no doubt as to the mutual bearings of these\r\nmatters.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial uses of Fungi and Saccharomycetes.\r\n\r\nThere are many industrial processes which are more or less\r\ndependent for success on bacterial fermentations. The subject is\r\nyoung, but the results already obtained are seen to be of immense\r\nimportance from a scientific point of view, and to open up vistas of\r\npractical application already being taken advantage of in commerce,\r\nwhile problems are continually being raised by the forester, the\r\nagriculturist, the gardener, the dairyman, the brewer, dyer, tanner,\r\nand with regard to various industries, which will eventually confer\r\ngreat advantages in their economic application.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable discovery made by Alvarez of the bacillus, which\r\nconverts a sterilised decoction of the indigo plant into indigo sugar\r\nand indigo white, the latter then oxidising to form the valuable\r\nblue dye, whereas the sterile decoction itself, even in presence of\r\noxygen, forms no indigo, plainly proves how these minute organisms\r\nmay be turned to a good account. There are, however, important points\r\nto be determined as to the action of the fermentation brought about\r\nby these enzymes, and the appearance of certain mysterious diseases\r\nin the indigo vats. Again, certain stages in the preparation of tea\r\nand tobacco leaves are found to depend upon very carefully regulated\r\nfermentations, which must be stopped at the right moment, or the\r\nproduct will be spoilt. Regarding the possible _rôle_ of bacteria,\r\nthe West Indian tobacco has a special bacterium, which has been\r\nisolated and found to play a very important part in its flavour.\r\nEvery botanist knows that flax and hemp are the best fibres of Linum\r\nand Cannabis respectively, separated by steeping in water until the\r\nmiddle lamella is destroyed and the fibres isolated; but it is not\r\nso well known that _not every water_ is suitable for this “retting”\r\nor steeping process; and for a long time this was as much a mystery\r\nas why some waters are so much better than others for brewing. Quite\r\nrecently Fribes has succeeded in isolating the bacillus upon which the\r\ndissolution of the middle lamella depends. This investigation brought\r\nout other interesting details as to the reaction produced by living\r\nmicro-organisms, and which can be utilised in deciding questions of\r\nplant chemistry too subtile for testing with ordinary re-agents. One\r\nother important fact connected with these researches is that botanists\r\nhave now discarded the view that the middle lamella of the plants\r\nreferred to is composed of cellulose, and know that it consists of\r\npectin compounds. Fribes’ anærobic bacillus is found to dissolve and\r\ndestroy pectins and pectinates, but does not touch cellulose or gum.\r\nIt is well known that the steeping of skins in water in preparation\r\nfor tanning involves bacterial action, owing to which the hair and\r\nepidermal coverings are removed, but it also appears that in the\r\nprocess of swelling the limed skins, the gases evolved in the substance\r\nof the tissues, and the evolution of which causes the swelling and\r\nloosens the fibre so that the tanning solutions may penetrate, are due\r\nto a particular fermentation caused by a bacterium, which, according\r\nto some investigators, is identical with a lactic ferment introduced\r\nby the pine bark, and which is responsible for the advantageous\r\nacidification of the tanning solutions.\r\n\r\nHay is made in different ways, and in those where a “spontaneous”\r\nheating process is resorted to the fermentation is no doubt dependent\r\nupon the presence of thermogenic bacteria. But probably no other\r\nsubject has attained to so much importance as the bacteriology of the\r\ndairy: the study of the bacteria found in milk, butter, and cheese in\r\ntheir various forms.\r\n\r\nOf milk, especially, much has been written and said as a\r\ndisease-transmitting medium, and with every good reason, and, if the\r\nstatement of a Continental authority may be accepted that each time we\r\neat a slice of bread and butter we devour a number of bacteria equal to\r\nthe population of Europe, we have sure grounds for seeking for further\r\ninformation as to what these bacteria are and what they are doing. And\r\nsimilarly so with cheese, which teems with millions of these minute\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n“Some few years ago it was found that the peculiar aroma of butter\r\nwas due to a bacterium. There are two species of bacteria, one of\r\nwhich develops an exquisite flavour and aroma, but the butter keeps\r\nbadly, while the other develops less aroma, but the butter keeps\r\nbetter. In America, however, they have isolated and distributed pure\r\ncultures of a particular butter bacillus which develops the famous\r\n‘June’ flavour, hitherto only met with in the butter made in a certain\r\ndistrict during a short season of the year. This fine-flavoured butter\r\nis now constantly manufactured in a hundred American dairies; and the\r\nmanufacture of pure butter with a constant flavour has become a matter\r\nof certainty.\r\n\r\n“Properly considered, the manufacture of cheese is a form of\r\n‘microscopic gardening’ even more complex and more horticultural in\r\nnature than the brewing of beer. From the first moment, when the\r\ncheesemaker guards and cools his milk, till his stock is ready he\r\nis doing his best to keep down the growth of micro-organisms rushing\r\nabout to take possession of his milk. He therefore coagulates it with\r\nrennet--an enzyme of animals, but also, as we have seen, common in\r\nplants--and the curd thus prepared is simply treated as a medium, on\r\nwhich he grows certain fungi and bacteria, with every needed precaution\r\nfor favouring their development, and protecting them against the\r\ninroads of other pests and against unsuitable temperature, moisture,\r\nand access of light. Having succeeded in growing the right kind of\r\nplants on his curd, his art then demands that he shall stop their\r\ngrowth at the critical moment, and his cheese is ready for market.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore, the particular flavour and peculiar odours of cheeses,\r\nas Camembert, Stilton, and Roquefort, have to be obtained, and this is\r\nsecured, for instance, by cultivating a certain fungus, Penicillium, on\r\nbread, and purposely adding it to Roquefort. This is found to destroy\r\nthe lactic and other acids, and so enables certain bacteria in the\r\ncheese to set to work and further change the medium; whereas in another\r\nkind of cheese the object is to prevent this fungus paving the way for\r\nthese bacteria. Another kind of bacillus has been discovered which\r\ngives a peculiar clover aroma to certain cheeses.\r\n\r\n“It is thought that more definite results will be obtained by the\r\ninvestigation of the manufacture of the vegetable cheeses of China\r\nand Japan, which are made by exposing the beans of the leguminous\r\nplant, _Glycine_--termed soja-beans--to bacterial fermentations in\r\nwarm cellars with or without certain mould-fungi. Several kinds of\r\nbean-cheeses are made in this way, known by special names. They\r\nall depend upon the peculiar decompositions of the tissues of the\r\ncotyledons of the soja-beans, which contain 35 to 40 per cent. of\r\nproteids and quantities of fatty matter. The softened beans are first\r\nrendered mouldy, and the interpenetrating hyphæ render the contents\r\naccessible to certain bacteria, which peptonise and otherwise alter\r\nthem. There is the further question of the manufacture of vinegar\r\nby fermentation, of the preparation of soy from a brine extract of\r\nmouldy and fermented soja-beans, of bread-making, and other equally\r\ninteresting manufactures.”\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of De Bary’s Investigations in Parasitism.\r\n\r\n“When the idea of parasitism was rendered definite by the fundamental\r\ndistinction drawn by De Bary between a _parasite_ and a _saprophyte_,\r\nit soon became evident that some further distinction must be made\r\nbetween _obligate facultative_ parasites and saprophytes respectively.\r\nDe Bary, when he proposed these terms for adoption, was clearly alive\r\nto the existence of transitions which we now know to be numerous\r\nand so gradual in character that we can no longer define any such\r\nphysiological groups. Twenty years ago penicillium and mucor would have\r\nbeen regarded as _saprophytes_ of the most obligate type, but we now\r\nknow that under certain circumstances these fungi can become parasites,\r\nand the borderland between facultative parasites and saprophytes on the\r\none hand, and between the former and true parasites on the other, can\r\nno longer be recognised.”\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the germ of an idea was sown which has taken root and extended.\r\nDe Bary pointed out that in the case of lichens we have either a fungus\r\nparasite on an algæ, or else certain organisms hitherto accepted as\r\nalgæ are merely incomplete forms.\r\n\r\n“In 1879 the same observer definitely launched the new hypothesis\r\nof _symbiosis_. The word itself is due to Frank, who, in a valuable\r\npaper on the biology of the thallus of certain lichens, very clearly\r\nset forth the existence of various stages of life in common among\r\nall the lower forms of plants. The details of these matters are now\r\nprincipally of historical interest. We now know that lichens are dual\r\norganisms, composed of various algæ, symbiotic with Ascomycetes, with\r\nBasidiomycetes, and, as Massee has shown, even with Gastromycetes.\r\nThe soil contains also bacterio-lichens. Hence arose a new biological\r\nidea--that a fungus may be in such nicely-balanced relationship with\r\nthe host from which it derives its sustenance, that it may be attended\r\nwith nearly equal advantage to both.\r\n\r\n“In the humus of forests we find the roots of beeches and other\r\nCupuliferæ (willows, pines, and so forth) clothed with a dense mantle\r\nof hyphæ, and swollen into fleshlike masses of mycorhiza. In similar\r\nsoils, and in moorlands, which abound in the slowly decomposing\r\nroot-fibres and other vegetable remains so characteristic of these\r\nsoils, the roots of orchids, heaths, gentians, &c., are similarly\r\nprovided with fungi, the hyphæ of which penetrate further into the\r\ntissues, and even send haustoria into the living cells, but without\r\ninjuring them. As observations multiplied it became clear that the\r\nmycorhiza, or fungus-root, was not to be dismissed as a mere case of\r\nroots affected by parasites, but that a symbiotic union, comparable\r\nto that of the lichens, exists, and we must assume that both tree and\r\nfungus derive benefit from the connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.--Fine Section through Truffle.\r\n\r\n_a._ Asci filled with spores; _b._ Mycelia, × 250.]\r\n\r\n“Frank stated, as the result of his experimental research, that\r\nseedling forest-trees cannot be grown in sterilised soil, where their\r\nroots are prevented from forming mycorhiza; and he concluded that the\r\nfungus conveys organic materials to the roots, which it obtains by\r\nbreaking down the leaf-mould and decaying plant remains, together with\r\nwater and minerals from the soil, and plays the especial part of a\r\nnitrogen-catching apparatus. In return for this import service the root\r\npays a tax to the fungus by sparing it certain of its tissue contents.\r\nIt is a curious fact then that the mycorhiza is only formed where\r\nhumus or vegetable mould abounds.”\r\n\r\nThese instructive investigations offer an intelligible explanation of\r\nthe growth of that well-known subterranean fungus, the truffle (_Tuber\r\ncibarium_), the microscopic appearances of a section of which formed\r\nthe subject of a paper I contributed to “The Popular Science Review”\r\nsome years ago (1862). The fungus, as will be seen by the fine section\r\ncut through a truffle, Fig. 280, consists of flocculent filaments,\r\nwhich in the first instance cover the ground at the fall of the leaf\r\nin autumn, under oak or beech trees, the hyphæ of which penetrate\r\nthe ground, through the humid soil to the _root-hairs_ of the tree.\r\nFilaments (mycelia) are again given off which terminate in asci or sacs\r\nfilled with minute spores of about 1/2500th of an inch in size, while\r\nthe interspaces are filled up by mycelia, that become consolidated into\r\na firm nut-like body.\r\n\r\nWhat happens, then, is this: Trees and plants with normal roots and\r\nroot-hairs, when growing in ordinary soil, can adapt their roots\r\nto life in a soil heavily charged with humus only by contracting\r\nsymbiotic association with the fungus and paying the tax demanded by\r\nthe latter in return for its supplies and services. If this adaptation\r\nis impossible, and no other suitable variation is evolved, such trees\r\ncannot grow in such soils. The physiological relations of the root\r\nto the fungus must be different in details in the case of non-green,\r\npurely saprophytic, plants, Neottia, Monotropa, &c., and in that of\r\ngreen plants like Erica, Fagus, and Pinus. It is, however, a well-known\r\nfact that ordinary green plants cannot utilize vegetable débris\r\ndirectly, and forest trees do so in appearance only, for the fungi,\r\nyeasts and bacteria there are actively decomposing the leaves and other\r\nremains. A class of pseudo-symbiotic organisms are, however, being\r\nbrought into the foreground, where the combined action of two symbionts\r\nresults in the death of or injury to a third plant, each symbiont\r\nalone proving harmless. Some time ago Vuillemin showed that a disease\r\nin olives results from the invasion of a bacillus (_B. oleæ_), which\r\ncan, however, only obtain its way into the tissues through the passages\r\ndriven by the hyphæ of a fungus (Chætophoma). The resulting injury is a\r\nsort of burr. This observer also observed the same bacillus and fungus\r\nin the canker burrs of the ash.\r\n\r\nAmong many similar cases well worth further attention are the invasion\r\nof potato-tubers by bacteria, these making their way down the decaying\r\nhyphæ of pioneer fungi. Professor Marshall Ward has seen tomatoes\r\ninfected by similar means, and other facts show that many bacteria\r\nwhich quicken the rotting of wood are thus led into the tissues by\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nProbably no subject in the whole domain of cryptogamic botany has\r\nwider bearings on agricultural science than the study of the flora\r\nand changes on and in manure and soil. Nitrifying bacteria play a\r\nvery important part by providing plant life with a most necessary\r\nfood. They occur in the soil, and two kinds have been described--the\r\none kind converting ammonia into nitrous acid, and the other changing\r\nnitrous into nitric acid. We are principally indebted to Winogradsky\r\nfor our knowledge of these bacteria; he furnishes instances of the\r\nbearing of bacteriological work on this department of science, and\r\nexplains, not only the origin of nitre-beds and deposits, but also\r\nthe way the ammonia compounds fixed by the soil in the neighbourhood\r\nof the root-hairs are nitrified, and so rendered directly available\r\nto plant life. The investigations of other observers show that the\r\nnitrifying organism is a much more highly-developed and complex form\r\nthan had been suspected; that it can be grown on various media, and\r\nthat it exhibits considerable polymorphism--_i.e._, it can be made to\r\nbranch out and show other characteristics of a true fungus. “I have,”\r\nwrites Professor Ward, “for some time insisted on the fact that river\r\nwater contains reduced forms of bacteria--_i.e._, forms so altered by\r\nexposure to light, changes of temperature, and the low nutritive value\r\nof the water, that it is only after prolonged culture in richer food\r\nmedia that their true nature becomes apparent.” Strutzer and Hartleb\r\nshow that the morphological form of the nitrifying organism can be\r\nprofoundly altered by just such variations of the conditions described\r\nby Ward, and that it occurs as a branched mycelial form; as bacilli\r\nor bacteria; or as cocci of various dimensions, according to the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n“These observations, and others made on variations in form\r\n(polymorphism) in other fungi and bacteria, open out a vast field for\r\nfurther work, and must lead to advancement in our knowledge of these\r\npuzzling organisms; they also help us to explain many inconsistencies\r\nin the existing systems of classification of the so-called ‘species’ of\r\nbacteria as determined by test-tube culture.”\r\n\r\n=Algæ.=--The algals have a special charm for microscopists. I am free\r\nto confess my interest in these organisms, and for several reasons. In\r\nthis humid climate of ours they are accessible during the greater part\r\nof the year; they can be found in any damp soil, in bog, moss, and in\r\nwater--indeed, wherever the conditions for their existence seem to be\r\nat all favourable for development. Should the soil dry up for a time,\r\nwhen the rain returns algæ are seen to spring into life and give forth\r\ntheir dormant spores, which once more resume the circle of formation\r\nand propagation. In the earliest stage of development the spore or\r\nspore cell is so very small when in a desiccated state, that any number\r\nmay be carried about by the slightest breath of air and borne away to\r\na great distance. To all such organisms I originally gave the name of\r\nÆrozoa; now recognised as ærobic and anærobic organisms (Fig. 281).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.--Ærobic Spores × 200.\r\n\r\n1. Ærobic fungi caught over a sewer; 2. Fragments of Penicillium\r\nspores; 3. Ærobic fungi taken in the time of the cholera visitation,\r\n1854.]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the ærobic bacteria I have only to add that in\r\naddition to the simple mode of taking them on glass slides smeared\r\nover with glycerine, special forms of æroscopes are now in use for the\r\npurpose, consisting of a small cylinder in which a current of air is\r\nproduced by an aspirator and diffused through a glass vessel containing\r\na sterilised fluid. These are in constant use in all bacteriological\r\nlaboratories. The results obtained are transferred to sterilised flasks\r\nor tubes as those shown in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nMiquel, who has given considerable attention to the subject of ærobic\r\nand anærobic bacteria, reckons that the number of spores that find\r\ntheir way into the human system by respiration, even should health be\r\nperfectly sound, may be estimated at 300,000 a day.\r\n\r\nOne of the most commonly met with forms of micro-organisms is\r\n_Leptothrix buccalis_. It chiefly finds its nutritive material in the\r\ninterstices of the teeth, and is composed of short rods and tufted\r\nstems of vigorous growth, to which the name of _Bacillus subtilis_ has\r\nbeen given (Fig. 282). Among numerous other fungoid bodies discovered\r\nin the mouth, Sarcinæ have been found. See Plate IX., No. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.--Section of the Mucous Membrane of the Mouth,\r\n× 350.\r\n\r\nShowing: _a._ The denser connective tissue; _b._ Teased out tissue;\r\n_c._ Muscular fibre; _d._ _Leptothrix buccalis_, together with minute\r\nforms of bacteria and micrococci; _e._ Ascomycetes and starch granules.]\r\n\r\nThe Beggiatoa, a sewage fungus, found by me in the river Lea water of\r\n1884 growing in great profusion, consists chiefly of mycelial threads\r\nand a number of globular, highly refractive bodies, and may be regarded\r\nas evidence of the presence in the water of an abnormal amount of\r\nsulphates which set free a gas, sulphuretted hydrogen, of a dangerous\r\nand offensive character. Another curious body closely allied to\r\n_Beggiatoa alba_ is Cladothrix; this assumes a whitish pellicle on the\r\nsurface of putrefying liquids.\r\n\r\nThese saprophytes obtain nourishment from organic matter; nevertheless\r\nthey are not true parasites in the first stage of their existence,\r\nduring which they live freely in the water or in damp soil; they,\r\nhowever, become pathogenic parasites when they penetrate into the\r\ntissues of animals, and necessarily live at the expense of their host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNGI, ALGÆ, LICHENS, ETC.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.]\r\n\r\nBacteria, as I have said, were for a long time classed with fungi under\r\nthe name of Schizomycetes. But the more recent researches into their\r\norganisation, and more especially into their mode of reproduction,\r\nshow that they rather more resemble a group of algæ devoid of\r\nchlorophyll. Zopf asserts that the same species of algals may at one\r\ntime be presented in the form of a plant living freely in water, or\r\nin damp ground, in association with chlorophyllaceous protoplasm,\r\nand at another in the form of a bacterium devoid of green colouring\r\nmatter, and receiving nourishment from organic substances previously\r\nelaborated by plants or animals, thus accommodating itself, according\r\nto circumstances, to two very different modes of existence.\r\n\r\nThat widely-distributed single-cell plant, the _Palmoglœa macrococca_\r\nof Kützing, that spreads itself as a green slime over damp stones,\r\nwalls, and other bodies, affords an example. If a small portion be\r\nscraped off and placed on a slip of glass, and examined with a half\r\nor a quarter-inch power, it will be seen to consist of a number of\r\novoid cells, having a transparent structureless envelope, nearly\r\nfilled by granular matter of a greenish colour. At certain periods\r\nthis mass divides into two parts, and ultimately the cell becomes two.\r\nSometimes the cells are united end to end, just as we see them united\r\nin the actively-growing yeast plant; but in this case the growth is\r\naccelerated, apparently, by cold and damp. Another plant belonging to\r\nthe same species, the _Protococcus pluvialis_, is found in every pool\r\nof water, the spores of which must be always floating in the air, since\r\nthey appear after every shower of rain.\r\n\r\n_Protococcus pluvialis_ is furnished with motile organs--two\r\nor more vibratile flagella passing through perforations in the\r\ncell-wall--whereby, at certain stages, they move rapidly about. The\r\nflagella are distinctly seen on the application of the smallest drop\r\nof iodine. The more remarkable of the several forms presented by\r\nthe plant is that of naked spores, termed by Flotow _Hæmatococcus\r\nporphyrocephalus_. These minute bodies are usually seen to consist\r\nof green, red, and colourless granules in equal proportions, and\r\noccupying different portions of the cell. They seem to have some share\r\nin the after subdivision of the cell (Fig. 283). There are also\r\n_still_-cells, which sub-divide into two, while the motile cells\r\ndivide into four or eight. It is not quite clear what becomes of the\r\nmotile zoospores, B, but as they have been seen to become encysted,\r\nthey doubtless have a special function, or become _still_-cells under\r\ncertain circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt appears that both longitudinal and transverse division of the\r\nprimordial cell takes place; and that the vibratile flagella of the\r\nparent cell retain to the last their function and their motion after\r\nthe primordial cell has become detached and transformed into an\r\nindependent secondary cell (Fig. 283, G).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.--Cell Development.

Division of an encysted nucleated cell\r\ninto four parts, with vibratile filaments projecting; G. Fission of a\r\nyoung cell.]\r\n\r\nThe most striking of the vital phenomena presented by Protococcus is\r\nthat of periodicity. Certain forms--for instance, encysted zoospores,\r\nof a certain colour, appear in a given infusion, at first exclusively,\r\nthen they gradually diminish, become more and more rare, and finally\r\ndisappear altogether. After some time their number again increases,\r\nand this may be repeated. Thus, a cell which at one time presented\r\nonly still forms at another contained only motile ones. The same may\r\nbe said with respect to segmentation. If a number of motile cells be\r\ntransferred from a larger vessel into a smaller one, in the course of\r\na few hours most of them will have subsided to the bottom, and in the\r\ncourse of the day observed to be on the point of sub-division. On the\r\nfollowing morning division will have become completed; on the next day\r\nthe bottom of the vessel will be found covered with a new generation\r\nof self-dividing cells, which, again, will produce another generation.\r\nThis regularity, however, is not always observed. The influence of\r\nevery change in the external conditions of life upon the plant is very\r\nremarkable. It is only necessary to pour water from a smaller into a\r\nlarger or shallower vessel to at once induce segmentation of cells.\r\nThe same phenomenon occurs in other algals; thus Vaucheria almost\r\nalways develops zoospores at whatever time of year they may be brought\r\nfrom their natural habitat into a warm room. Light is conducive to\r\nthe manifestation of vital action in the motile spores; they usually\r\ncollect in great numbers on the surface of the water, and at that part\r\nexposed to the strongest light.\r\n\r\nBut in the act of propagation, on the contrary, and when about to pass\r\ninto the still condition, the motile Protococcus cell seems to shun\r\nlight, and falls to the bottom of the vessel. Too strong sunlight,\r\nas when concentrated by a lens, quickly kills the young zoospores.\r\nA temperature of undue elevation is injurious to the development of\r\ntheir vital activity and the formation of the zoospores. Frost destroys\r\nmotile, but not still zoospores.[55]\r\n\r\n_Stephanosphæra pluvialis_ is a conspicuous variety of the fresh-water\r\nalgals, described by Cohn. It consists of a cell containing eight\r\nprimordial cells filled with chlorophyll, uniformly arranged (see Plate\r\nI., No. 24 _d_). The globular mother-cell rotates, somewhat in the\r\nsame way as the volvox, by vibratile flagella, two of which are seen\r\nprojecting from each cell and piercing the transparent outer cell wall.\r\nEvery cell divides first into two, then four, and lastly eight cells,\r\neach one of which again divides into a number of micro-gonidia, which\r\nhave a motion within the mother-cell, and ultimately escape from it.\r\nUnder certain circumstances each of the eight young cells is observed\r\nto change places in the interior of the cell; eventually they escape,\r\nlose their flagella, form a thicker membrane as at _b_, and for a time\r\nremain motionless, and sink to the bottom of the vessel in which they\r\nare contained. If the vessel is permitted to become thoroughly dry, and\r\nthen again has water poured into it, motile cells reappear; from which\r\ncircumstance it is probable that these represent the resting spores of\r\nthe plant. When in the condition of greatest activity its division into\r\neight is perfected during the night, and early in the morning light the\r\nyoung cells escape and pass through similar changes. It is calculated\r\nthat in eight days, under favourable circumstances, 16,777,216 families\r\nmay be formed from one resting-cell of Stephanosphæra. In certain of\r\nthe cells, and at particular periods, remarkable amœboid bodies (Plate\r\nI., No. 24 _c_) make their appearance. There is a marked difference\r\nbetween Stephanosphæra and Chlamydococcus, for while in the latter the\r\nindividual portions of a primordial cell separate entirely from one\r\nanother, each developing its own enveloping membrane, and ultimately\r\nescaping as a unicellular individual; in the former, on the other hand,\r\nthe eight portions remain for a time living in companionship.\r\n\r\n_Volvocineæ._--A fresh-water unicellular plant of singular beauty\r\nand interest to the microscopist is the _Volvox globator_ (Plate I.,\r\nNo. 15). No. 16 represents a portion of another cell, with brownish\r\namœboid bodies enclosed in the protoplasmic web. It is common to our\r\nfresh-water pools, and attains a diameter of about 1/20th or 1/30th\r\nof an inch. Its movement is peculiar, a continued roll onwards, or a\r\nrotation like that of a top; at other times it glides along smoothly.\r\nWhen examined under a sufficiently high power, it is seen to be a\r\nhollow sphere, studded with green spots, and traversed by green threads\r\nconnecting each of the spots or spores with the maternal cell. From\r\neach of the spores proceed two long flagella, lashing filaments, which\r\nkeep the globular body on the move. After a time the sphere bursts,\r\nand the contained sporules issue forth and speedily pass through a\r\nsimilar stage of development. These interesting cells were long taken\r\nto be animal bodies. Ehrenberg described them as _Monads_, possessing a\r\nmouth, stomach, and an eye.\r\n\r\nThe setting free of the young volvox is essentially a process of\r\ncell division, occurring during the warmer periods of the year, and,\r\nas Professor Cohn shows, is a considerable advance upon the simpler\r\nconjugation of two smaller cells in desmids; it more closely resembles\r\nthat which prevails among the higher algæ and a large number of\r\ncryptogams. As autumn advances the volvox spherules usually cease\r\nto multiply by the formation of zoosporanges, and certain of their\r\nordinary cells begin to undergo changes by which they are converted,\r\nsome into male or sperm-cells, others into germ-cells, but the greater\r\nnumber appear to remain sterile. Both kinds of cells at first so\r\nnearly resemble each other that it is only when the sperm cells begin\r\nto undergo sub-division that they are seen to be about three times\r\nthe size of the sterile cells. Then the primary cell resolves itself\r\ninto a cluster of peculiar secondary cells, each consisting of an\r\nelongated body containing an orange-coloured endochrome and a pair of\r\nlong flagella, as seen in the antherozoids of the higher cryptogams.\r\nAs the sperm-cells approach maturity the clusters may be seen to\r\nmove within them; the bundles then separate and show an independent\r\nactive movement while still within the cavity of the primary cell, and\r\nfinally escape through a rupture in the cell-wall, rapidly diffusing\r\nthemselves as they pass through the cavity. The germ-cells continue\r\nto increase in size without undergoing sub-division, at first showing\r\nlarge vacuoles in their protoplasm, but subsequently becoming filled\r\nwith a darker coloured endochrome. The form of the cell also changes\r\nfrom its flask-like shape to the globular, and at the same time seems\r\nto acquire a firmer envelope. Over this the swarming antherozoids\r\ndiffuse themselves and penetrate the substance to the interior,\r\nand are then lost to view. The product of this fusion, Cohn tells\r\nus, is a reproductive cell, or “oospore,” which speedily becomes\r\nenveloped in another membrane with a thicker external coat, beset with\r\nconical-pointed processes; and now the chlorophyll of the young cell\r\ngives place, as in Palmoglæ, to starch and reddish or orange-coloured,\r\nand a more highly refractive, fluid. As many as forty of such oospores\r\nhave been counted in a single sphere of volvox, which then acquires\r\nthe peculiar appearance observed by Ehrenberg, and described by him\r\nunder the name of _Volvox stellatus_. The further history of this\r\nwonderful spheroid unicellular plant has been traced out by Kirchner,\r\nwho found that their germination commences in the early months of the\r\nyear--in February--with the liberation of the spherical endospore\r\nfrom its envelope and its division into four cells. A remarkable\r\nphenomenon has been observed by Dr. Braxton Hicks--the conversion\r\nof an ordinary volvox cell into a moving mass of protoplasm that\r\nbears a striking resemblance to the well-known amœba. “Towards the\r\nend of the autumn the endochrome mass of the volvox increases to\r\nnearly double its ordinary size, but instead of undergoing the usual\r\nsub-division so as to produce a macrogonidium, it loses its colour\r\nand regularity of form, and becomes an irregular mass of colourless\r\nprotoplasm, containing a number of brownish granules.” The final change\r\nand the ultimate destination of these curious amœboid bodies have\r\nnot been satisfactorily made out, but from other observations on the\r\nprotoplasmic contents of the cells of the roots of mosses, which in the\r\ncourse of two hours become changed into ciliated bodies, it is believed\r\nthat this is the mode in which these fragile structures are enabled to\r\nretain life and to resist all the external conditions, such as damp,\r\ndryness, and the alternations of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite impossible to deny the great similarity there\r\nis between the structure of volvox and that of the motile cell of\r\n_Protococcus pluvialis_. The influence of reagents will sometimes\r\ncause the connecting processes of the young cells, as in Protococcus,\r\nto be drawn back into the central mass, and the connecting threads\r\nare sometimes seen as double lines, or tubular prolongations of the\r\nmembrane. At other times they appear to be connected by star-like\r\nprolongations to the parent cell (Plate I., No. 15), presenting an\r\nalmost identical appearance with _Pediastrum pertusum_. Another body\r\ndesignated by Ehrenberg _Sphærosira volvox_ is an ordinary volvox in\r\na different stage of development; its only features of dissimilarity\r\nbeing that a large proportion of the green cells, instead of being\r\nsingle, are double or quadruple, and that the groups of flagellate\r\ncells form by their aggregation discoid bodies, each furnished with a\r\nsingle flagellum. These clusters separate themselves from the parent\r\ncell, and swim off freely under the forms which have been designated\r\nUvella and Syncrypta by Ehrenberg. Mr. Henry Carter, F.R.S., who made\r\na careful investigation of unicellular plants, described Sphærosira as\r\nthe male, or spermatic form of _volvox_.\r\n\r\nAmong other organisms closely allied to volvox and included in\r\nVolvocineæ, affording the microscopist many interesting transitional\r\nforms in their various modes of fructification, are the Eudorina,\r\nstill-water organisms that pass through a similar process of\r\nreproduction as the volvox. In the _Pandorina morum_, its reproduction\r\nis curiously intermediate between the lower and the higher types; as\r\nwithin each cell is a mulberry-like mass, composed of cells possessing\r\na definite number of swarm spores, sixteen usually, which rupture the\r\nmother cell, and swim off furnished with a pair of flagella. A similar\r\nprocess takes place in some of the Confervaceæ and other fresh-water\r\nalgæ. The Palmella, again, consist of (Plate I., No. 21) minute\r\norganisms of very simple structure, which grow either on damp surfaces\r\nor in fresh water. The stonework of some of our churches is often\r\nseen to be covered with a species of Palmella, that take the form of\r\nan indefinite slimy film. The “red snow” of Arctic or Alpine regions,\r\nconsidered to be a species of Protococcus, is frequently placed among\r\nPalmella. A more characteristic form of the _P. cruenta_ is the\r\n_Hæmatococcus sanguinis_, the whole mass of which is sub-divided by\r\npartitions enclosing a larger or smaller number of cells, which diffuse\r\ntheir granular contents through the gelatinous mass in which their\r\nseveral changes take place. The albuminoid envelope of these masses\r\nis seen to contain parasitic growths, which have given rise to some\r\ndiscussion, especially when their filaments are observed to radiate in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\nThe _Oscillariaceæ_ constitute a genus of Confervaceæ which have\r\nalways had very great interest for the microscopist in consequence\r\nof their very remarkable animal-like movements, and from which they\r\nderive their generic name. For more than a century these Bacillaria\r\nhave excited the curiosity of all observers without any one having\r\nderived more than an approximate idea of their remarkable rhythmical\r\nmovements. The frustule consists of a number of very fine short threads\r\nattached together by a gelatinous sheath, in one species all of equal\r\nlength. Their backward and forward movement is of a most singular\r\ncharacter; the only other conferva in which I have seen a motion of\r\na similar kind is the Schizonema. In this species the frustules are\r\npacked together in regular series, the front and side views being\r\nalways in the same direction. These several bodies move along within\r\nthe filamentous sheath without leaving their respective places. On\r\ncarefully following the movement, it is seen at first much extended,\r\nand then more compressed, while the frustules become more linear in\r\ntheir arrangement, and present a closer resemblance to _Bacillaria\r\nparadoxa_, augmented by the circumstance that the frustules are\r\nseen to move in both directions. A frustule of Schizonema can move\r\nindependently of the sheath, and so will a detached frustule of\r\nbacillaria. This peculiar and exceptionally anomalous phenomenon\r\nas that of the movements of bacillaria can hardly be confined to a\r\nsolitary species. The movements of the frustules are much accelerated\r\nby warmth and light. The longer filaments of other minute species only\r\nslightly exhibit any motion of the kind, but have peculiar undulating\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.--Confervaceæ.\r\n\r\n1. _Volvox globator_; 2. A section of volvox, showing the flagellate\r\nmargin of the cell; 3.

The species consist of unbranched\r\nfilaments composed of cylindrical or moniliform cells, with starch\r\ngranules. Many are vesicular, and all multiply by zoospores generated\r\nin the interior of the plant at the expense of the granular matter.\r\nThey are, for the most part, found in fresh water attached or floating,\r\nsome in salt water, and a few in both, in colour usually green, but\r\noccasionally olive, violet, and red. The Confervaceæ proper are often\r\ndivided into four families: 1. _Hydrodictidæ_; 2. _Zygnemidæ_; 3.\r\n_Confervidæ_; 4. _Chætophoridæ_. To the microscopist all the plants\r\nof this genera are extremely interesting as subjects for the study of\r\ncell multiplication. The process usually takes place in the terminal\r\ncell, the first step in which is the division of the endochrome, and\r\nthen follows a sort of hour-glass contraction across the cavity of the\r\nparent cell, whereby it is divided into two equal parts. This is better\r\nseen in some of the desmids than in Fig. 284, Nos. 4, 5, and 6. Some\r\nspecies are characterised by a different mode of reproduction; these\r\npossess a number of nuclei, and multiply by zoospores of two kinds,\r\nthe largest of which have either two or four cilia, which germinate\r\ndirectly the smaller are biciliated; conjugation has been seen to take\r\nplace in a few instances.\r\n\r\nAllied to the Confervaceæ is an interesting plant, _Sphæroplea\r\nannulina_, which has received careful attention from Cohn. The oospores\r\nof this plant are the product of a process partaking of a sexual\r\nnature, and when mature are filled with reddish fat vesicles which\r\ndivide by segmentation.\r\n\r\nThe _Ædogoniaceæ_ also closely resemble Confervaceæ in habits of\r\nlife, but differ in some particulars, especially so in the mode of\r\nreproduction (only a single large zoospore being set free from each\r\ncell) and by the almost complete fission of the cell-wall or one of\r\nthe rings which serve as a hinge. The zoospores are the largest known\r\namong algals, and each is described as having a red eye-spot. The\r\n_Chætophoraceæ_ form an interesting group of confervoid plants, and are\r\nusually found in running streams, as they prefer pure water. One of the\r\ncharacteristics of the group is that the extremities of the branches\r\nare prolonged into an acute-shaped termination, as represented in Fig.\r\n284, No. 6. A very pretty object under the microscope is _Draparnaldia\r\nglomerata_, belonging to this species. It consists of an axis composed\r\nof a row of cells, and at regular intervals whorls of slender\r\nprolongations, containing chlorophyll or endochrome of a deeper green;\r\nthese attain to an extraordinary length.\r\n\r\nThe _Batrachospermæ_ bear a strong resemblance to frog-spawn, from\r\nwhich they derive their name, and are chiefly a marine group of\r\nalgals allied to the Rhodespermeæ or red seaweeds. The late Dr. A.\r\nHassall first described them; they have since received more careful\r\nattention from M. Sirodot. They are reddish-green, extremely flexible,\r\nand nothing can surpass the grace of their movements in water; but\r\nwhen removed from their element they lose all form, and resemble a\r\njelly-like substance without a trace of organisation; but if allowed to\r\nremain quiet they regain their original shape.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the cell-membrane will be best demonstrated by breaking\r\nup the filaments, either by moving the thin glass cover, or by cutting\r\nthrough a mass of them in all directions with a fine dissecting knife.\r\nOn now examining the slide, in most instances many detached empty\r\npieces of the cell-membrane, with its striæ, will be seen, as well as\r\nfilaments partly deprived of protoplasm. On the application of iodine\r\nall these appearances become more distinguishable in consequence of\r\nthe filament turning red or brown, while the empty cells remain either\r\nunaffected, or present a slight yellowish tint, as is frequently the\r\ncase with cellulose when old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285.--_Mesoglia vermicularis._]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the contents of the cell, the endochrome is coloured in\r\nthe Oscillatoriæ, and is distinguishable by circular bands or rings\r\naround the axis of the cylindrical filament. Iodine stains them brown\r\nor red, and syrup and dilute sulphuric acid produce a beautiful rose\r\ncolour. As to their mode of propagation, nothing positive is known. If\r\nkept for some time they gradually lose their green colour; a portion\r\nof the mass, becoming brown, sinks to the bottom of the vessel, and\r\npresents a granular layer.\r\n\r\n_Mesoglia vermicularis_ (Fig. 285) consists of strings of cells\r\ncohering and held together by their membranous covering. In the lowly\r\norganised plant Vaucheria (Plate I., No. 23, _V. sessilis_)--so\r\nnamed after its discoverer Vaucher, a German botanist--a genus of\r\nSiphonaceæ, we have an example of true processes of sexual generation.\r\nThe branching filaments are often seen to bear at their sides peculiar\r\nglobular bodies or oval protuberances, nipple-shaped buddings-out of\r\nthe cell-wall, filled with a dark-coloured endochrome and distributed\r\nin pairs, one of which curves round to meet the other, when conjugation\r\nis seen to take place. Near these bodies others are found with\r\npointed projections, which have been described as “horns,” but these,\r\nPringshelm says, are “antherids which produce antherozoids in their\r\ninterior,” while the capsule-like bodies constituting the oospores\r\nbecome, when fertilised, a new generation, which swarm out through a\r\ncavity or aperture in the parent cell-wall.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of fresh-water and most olive-green algals is enclosed\r\nin spherical cavities under the epidermis of the frond, termed\r\nconceptacles, and may be either male or female. The zoids are\r\nbottle-shaped and have flagella; the transparent vesicle in which\r\nthey are contained is itself enclosed in a second of similar form. In\r\nmonœcious and diœcious algals the female conceptacles are distinguished\r\nfrom the male by their olive colour. The spores, when developed, are\r\nborne on a pedicle emanating from the inner wall of the conceptacle.\r\nThey rupture the outer wall at its apex; at first the spore appears\r\nsimple, but soon after a series of changes takes place, consisting in a\r\nsplitting up of the endochrome into six or eight masses of spheroidal\r\nbodies. A budding-out occurs in a few hours’ time, and ultimately\r\nelongates into a cylindrical thread. The Vaucheria present a double\r\nmode of reproduction, and their fronds consist of branching tubes\r\nresembling in their general character that of the Bryophyta, from which\r\nindeed they differ only in respect of the arrangement of their green\r\ncontents. In that most remarkable plant _Saprolegnia ferox_, which is\r\nstructurally so closely allied to Vaucheria, though separated from\r\nthem by the absence of green colouring matter, a corresponding analogy\r\nin the processes of development takes place. In the formation of its\r\nzoospores, an intermediate step is presented between that of the algæ\r\nand a class of plants formally placed among fungi.\r\n\r\n_The Ulvaceæ._--The typical form of seaweeds is the _Ulva lactuca_,\r\nwell known from its fronds of dark-green “laver” on every coast\r\nthroughout the world. Ulvæ are seen to differ but little from the\r\npreceding group of fresh-water algals. The specific difference is that\r\nthe cells, when multiplied by binary subdivision, not only remain in\r\nfirm connection with each other but possess a more regular arrangement.\r\nThe frond plane of the algal is either more simple or lobed, and is\r\nformed of a double layer of cells closely packed together and producing\r\nzoospores. The whole group is chiefly distinguished from Porphyra by\r\ntheir green colour, the latter being roseate or purple. Ulvæ are mostly\r\nmarine, with one or two exceptions. One species (_U. thermalis_) grows\r\nin the hot springs of Gastein, in a temperature of about 117° Fahr.\r\nThe development of Ulvæ is seen in Fig. 286. The isolated cells, A,\r\nresemble in some points those of the Protococcus; these give rise to\r\nsuccessive subdivisions determining the clusters seen at B and C, and\r\nby their aggregation to the confervoid filament shown at D. These\r\nfilaments increase in length and breadth by successive additions, and\r\nfinally take the form of fronds, or rows of cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.--Successive Stages of Development of Ulvæ.\r\n\r\nA. Isolated spores; B and C. Clusters of cells; D. Cells in the\r\nfilamentous stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.--_Sphacelaria cirrhosa_, with spores borne at\r\nthe sides of the branchlets.]\r\n\r\nThe marine greenish-olive algæ present a general appearance which might\r\nat first sight be mistaken for plants of a higher order of cryptogams.\r\nTheir fronds have no longer the form of a filament, but assume that\r\nof a membranous expansion of cells. The cells in which zoospores are\r\nfound have an increased quantity of coloured protoplasm accumulated\r\ntowards one point of the cell-wall; while the zoospores are observed to\r\nconverge with their apices towards the same point. In some algæ, which\r\nseem to be closely related in form and structure to the Bryophyta, we\r\nnotice this important difference, that the zoospores are developed in\r\nan organ specially destined for the purpose, presenting peculiarities\r\nof form and distinguishing it from other parts of the branching tubular\r\nfrond. In the genus Derbesia distinct spore cases develop, a young\r\nbranch of which, when destined to become a spore case, instead of\r\nelongating indefinitely, begins, after having arrived at a certain\r\nlength, to swell out into an ovoid vesicle, in the cavity of which a\r\nconsiderable accumulation of protoplasm takes place. This is separated\r\nfrom the rest of the plant, and becomes an opaque mass, surrounded by a\r\ndistinct membrane. After a time a division of the mass takes place,\r\nand a number of pyriform zoospores, each of which is furnished with\r\nflagella, are set free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESMIDIACEÆ, DIATOMACEÆ, ALGÆ.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE II.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.--_Cutleria dichotoma._ Section of lacinia of a\r\nfrond, showing the stalked eight-chambered oosporanges growing on tufts\r\nwith intercalated filaments. Magnified 50 diameters.]\r\n\r\nIn _Cutleria_ (Fig. 288) we have a special feature of interest with\r\ntwo kinds of organs, seemingly opposed to each other with regard to\r\ntheir reproductive functions. The sporangia not only differ from\r\nthose of other species, but the frond consists of olive-coloured\r\nirregularly-divided flagella, on each side of which tufts (_sori_)\r\nconsisting of the reproductive organs, intermixed with hair-like\r\nbodies, are scattered. The zoospores are divided by transverse\r\npartitions into four cavities, each of which is again bisected by\r\na longitudinal median septum. When first thrown off they are in\r\nappearance so much like the spores of Puccinia that they may be\r\nmistaken for them, although so very much larger than those of other\r\nolive-coloured algæ.\r\n\r\n_Florideæ_, the red algæ (Plate II.), present many varieties of\r\nstructure, although less appears to be known of their reproductive\r\nprocesses than of lower forms of cryptogamic plants. These are,\r\nhowever, of three kinds. The first, to which the term polyspore has\r\nbeen applied, is that of a gelatinous or membranous pericarp or\r\nconceptacle, in which an indefinite number of zoospores are contained.\r\nThis organ may be either at the summit or base of a branch, or it may\r\nbe concealed in or below the cortical layer of the stem. In some cases\r\na number of spore-bearing filaments emanate from a kind of membrane\r\nat the base of a spheroidal cellular perisporangium, by the rupture\r\nof which the zoospores formed from the endochrome of the filaments\r\nmake their escape. Other changes have been observed; however, they all\r\nagree in one particular, namely, that the zoospore is developed in the\r\ninterior of a cell, the wall of which forms its perispore, and the\r\ninternal protoplasmic membrane endochrome, the zoospore itself, for\r\nthe escape of which the perispore opens out at its apex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.--_Dasya kutzingiana_, with seed vessel and two\r\nrows of tetraspores. Magnified 50 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe second form is more simple, and consists of a globular or ovoid\r\ncell, containing a central granular mass; this ultimately divides into\r\nfour quadrate-shaped spores; these, on attaining maturity, escape by\r\nrupture of the cell-wall. Another organ, called a tetraspore, takes\r\nits origin in the cortical layer. The tetraspores are arranged either\r\nin an isolated manner along the branches, or in numbers together; in\r\nsome instances the branches that contain them are so modified in form\r\nthey look like special organs, and have been called stichidia; as,\r\nfor example, in Dasya (Fig. 289). Of the third kind of reproductive\r\norgan a difference of opinion exists as to the signification of their\r\nantheridia; although always produced in precisely the same situations\r\nas the tetraspores and polyspores, they are agglomerations of little\r\ncolourless cells, either united in a bunch, as in Griffithsia, or\r\nenclosed in a transparent cylinder, as in Polysiphonia, or covering a\r\nkind of expanded disc of peculiar form, as in Laurencia. According to\r\ncompetent observers, the cells contain spermatozoids. Nägeli describes\r\nthe spermatozoid as a spiral fibre, which, as it escapes, lengthens\r\nitself in the form of a screw. Thuret, on the contrary, says the\r\ncontents are granular, and offer no trace of a spiral filament, but\r\nare expelled from the cells by a slow motion. The antheridia appear in\r\ntheir most simple form in Callithamnion (Plate II., Nos. 32 and 34),\r\nbeing reduced to a small mass of cells composed by numerous little\r\nbunches which are sessile on the bifurcations of the terminal branches.\r\nThe spores are simpler structures than the tetraspores, and mostly\r\noccupy a more important position. They are not scattered through the\r\nfrond, but grouped in definite masses, and generally enclosed in a\r\nspecial capsule or conceptacle, which may be mistaken for a tetraspore\r\ncase. The simplest form of the spore fruit consists of spherical\r\nmasses of spores attached to the wall of the frond, or imbedded in\r\nits substance, without a proper conceptacle; such a fruit is called\r\na _favellidium_, and occurs in Halymenia; the same name is applied to\r\nthe fruits of similar structures not perfectly immersed, as those of\r\nGigartina, Gelidium, &c., where they form tubercular swellings on the\r\nlobes. In some, the tubercles present a pore at the summit, through\r\nwhich the spores emerge forth. In other cases, as in Ceramium (Plate\r\nII., Nos. 27 and 37), the spores occupy a more conspicuous place; a\r\ncharacteristic species is Delessaria (Plate II., No. 39), the coccidium\r\neither occurring on lateral branches, or is sessile on the face of the\r\nfrond, when it consists of a case filled with angular-shaped spores\r\nattached to the wall of the case. The general external appearance of\r\nthe red algæ is very varied, but it seems to attain to its deepest\r\ncolouring in the Red Sea, which, it is said, is entirely due to the\r\npeculiarly vivid red seaweed. They are all exquisite objects for the\r\nmicroscope, as may be surmised from the few varieties presented in\r\nPlate II. The Florideæ of the warmer seas exhibit most elegantly formed\r\nfronds, as will be seen on reference to the “Phycologia Australica” of\r\nthe late Dr. William Harvey, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nThe Characeæ may be placed among the highest of the algals, if only\r\nfor the complexity of their reproductive organs, which certainly\r\noffer a contrast in their simplicity of structure. _Chara vulgaris_,\r\nstonewort, is a simple fresh-water plant, preferring still freshwater\r\nponds or slow-moving rivers running over a chalky soil. It thus derives\r\nthe calcareous matter found in the axis of the plant, together with a\r\nsmall portion of silica. Its filaments (or branches, as some botanists\r\nprefer to call them) are given off in whorls. The Characeæ are a small\r\nfamily of acrogens, consisting of only two or three at most. They are\r\nmonœcious and diœcious, the two kinds of fruit being often placed close\r\ntogether. They may easily be grown in a tall glass jar for observation.\r\nAll that is necessary is to put the jar occasionally under the house\r\ntap and let the water run slowly over the top for a short time, thus\r\nrenewing the contents without disturbing the plant. The hard water\r\nsupplied to London suits chara better than softer water. Both chara and\r\nnitella are objects of great interest to microscopists, since in the\r\nformer the important fact of vegetable circulation was first observed.\r\nA portion of the plant of the natural size is shown in Fig. 290, No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharaceæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.--Diagrammatic sketch of Chara.\r\n\r\n1. A stem of _Chara vulgaris_, natural size; 2. Magnified view (arrows\r\nindicating the course taken by the chlorophyll); 3. A limb, with buds\r\nprotruding; 4. Portion of a leaf of _Vallisneria spiralis_, showing\r\ncyclosis of chlorophyll granules.]\r\n\r\nEach plant is composed of an assemblage of long tubiform cells placed\r\nend to end, with fixed intervals, around which the branchlets are\r\ndisposed with great regularity. In nitella the stem and branches are\r\ncomposed of simple cells, which sometimes attain to several inches in\r\nlength. Each _node_, or zone, from which the branches spring, consists\r\nof a single plate, or layer, of small cells, which are a continuation\r\nof the cortical layer of the internode (Fig. 290, No. 3) as an\r\noutgrowth. Each cell is partially filled with chlorophyll granules,\r\nand it is these that are seen under the microscope taking the course\r\nshown by the arrows (Fig. 290, No. 2). The rate of movement of the\r\ngranules is accelerated by moderate warmth and retarded by cold. It\r\nis in viewing the circulation in water plants that the warm stage of\r\nthe microscope is brought into use. Borne along with the protoplasmic\r\nstream are a number of solid particles consisting of starch granules\r\nand other matters. The method of viewing the circulation is by\r\ncutting sections off a portion of the plant with a very sharp knife,\r\nand arranging them in a growing cell with a few drops of water, and\r\ncovering over with a thin cover-glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.--The Fructification of _Chara fragilis_.\r\n\r\nA.

Spores and elaters of Equisetum; G. Spores surrounded by\r\nelaters of Equisetum.]\r\n\r\nThe reproductive process of Chara is effected by two sets of bodies,\r\nboth of which are placed at the base of the branches (Fig. 291, E and\r\nD) either on the same or different plants, one set known as globules\r\nor _antherids_, and the other as nucules, containing the oospores or\r\n_archegones_. These are often of a bright red colour, and have covering\r\nplates, or shields (B and E), curiously marked, and the central portion\r\nis composed of a number of filaments rolled up (as in E) or free (as\r\nseen at B), projecting out from the centre of the sphere. The antherid\r\nis supported on a short flask-shaped pedicle, which projects into the\r\ninterior. At the apex of each of the eight manubria is a roundish\r\nhyaline cell, termed a capitulum, and at its apex again six smaller\r\nor secondary capitula. The long whip-shaped filaments are divided by\r\ntransverse septa into a hundred or more compartments, every one of\r\nwhich is filled with an antherozoid (as at A), consisting of a spiral\r\nthread of protoplasm packed into two or three coils; these escape and\r\nbecome free (as seen at C), each having two long fine flagella. The\r\nyoung antherozoid swims off with a lashing action, and the whole field\r\nappears for a time filled with life. They swim about freely, but their\r\nmotion gradually ceases, and soon they arrive at a state of inaction.\r\n\r\n_Nitella_ appears to have a somewhat different mode of fructification\r\nto that of its congener. It puts forth a long filamentous branch\r\nfrom one of its joints, which, on reaching the surface of the water,\r\nterminates in a whitish fruit-like cluster. It is even a more delicate\r\nand less robust algal than chara, and every care should be taken to\r\nimitate the still water in which it grows. It delights in shady woods\r\nand in calcareous open pools.\r\n\r\nSimilar care is requisite with regard to Vallisneria; and a more equal\r\ntemperature is better suited to the growth of this aquatic plant. It\r\nshould be planted in the middle of the jar or aquarium, about two\r\ninches deep in mould, closely pressed down, then gently fill the jar\r\nwith water. When the water requires changing, a small portion only\r\nshould be run off at a time. It appears to thrive in proportion to the\r\nfrequency of changing the water, and taking care that the water added\r\nrather increases the temperature than lowers it.\r\n\r\nThe natural habitat of the _Frog-bit_, another water-plant of much\r\ninterest, is found on the surface of ponds and ditches; in the autumn\r\nits seeds fall, and become buried in the mud at the bottom during\r\nthe winter; in the spring these plants rise to the surface, produce\r\nflowers, and grow throughout the summer. Chara may be found in many\r\nplaces around London, and in the upper reaches of the Thames.\r\n\r\n_Anacharis alsinastrum._--This remarkable plant is so unlike any other\r\nwater-plant that it may be at once recognised by its leaves growing _in\r\nthrees_ round a slender stem. It is also known as “Waterthyme,” from a\r\nresemblance it bears to that plant.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the plant is deep green; the leaves are nearly half an\r\ninch long, by an eighth wide, egg-shaped at the point, with serrated\r\nedges. Its powers of increase are prodigious, as every fragment is\r\ncapable of becoming an independent plant, producing roots and stems,\r\nand extending itself indefinitely in every direction. The specific\r\ngravity of it is so nearly that of water, that it is more disposed to\r\nsink than float. A small branch of the plant is represented, with a\r\nhydra attached to it, in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThe special cells in which the circulation is most readily seen are the\r\nelongated cells around the margin of the leaf and those of the midrib.\r\nOn examining the leaf with polarised light, the cells are observed to\r\ncontain a large proportion of silica, and present a very interesting\r\nappearance. A bright band of light encircles the leaf, and traverses\r\nits centre. In fact, the leaf is set, as it were, in a framework of\r\nsilica. By boiling the leaf for a short time in equal parts of nitric\r\nacid and water, a portion of the vegetable tissue is destroyed, and the\r\nsilica rendered more distinct, without changing the form of the leaf.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to make a thin section or strip from the leaf of\r\nVallisneria for the purpose of exhibiting the circulation in the cells,\r\nas shown in Fig. 290, No. 4. Among the cell granules, a few of a more\r\ntransparent character than the rest, are seen to have a nucleolus\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of cell cyclosis occurs in other plants beside those\r\ngrowing in water. The leaf of the common plantain or dock, Plantago,\r\nfurnishes a good example, the movement being seen both in the cells of\r\nthe plant and hairs of the cuticle torn from the midrib.\r\n\r\n_Cell-division._--In order to study the process of cell-division the\r\nhairs on the stamens of Tradescantia should be taken. Remove one from\r\na bud on a warm day and let a drop of a one per cent. sugar solution\r\nfall upon it, and cover it with a thin glass cover. Place it for a\r\nshort time in a _moist-chamber_ (Fig. 256), and then examine it with\r\na magnifying power of 500 diameters. The nucleus of the cell will\r\nbe seen, near its terminal position, to gradually elongate in the\r\ndirection of the longer axis of the cell and become more granular,\r\nwhile the protoplasm moves towards the extreme end; the nucleus at\r\nthe same time will present a striated appearance, with the fibrilla\r\narranged parallel to the longer axis of the nucleus, and at length\r\napproach each other at the poles. A nuclear spindle will now be\r\nproduced, and the fibres ruptured in the equatorial plane, so that\r\ntwo nuclei will be found in place of the one. The best preparations\r\nof nuclei are obtained by making thin longitudinal sections of\r\nactively-growing plants (young rootlets of Pinus, for example), and\r\nstaining them with hæmatoxylin in the manner described in a former\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesmidiaceæ and Diatomaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe two groups of Desmidiaceæ and Diatomaceæ differ so little in\r\ntheir general characters that they may be spoken of as members or\r\nrepresentative families of microscopic and unicellular algæ alike in\r\ntheir remarkable beauty and bilateral symmetry, and of such peculiar\r\ninterest as to call for special notice. Desmids differ from diatoms\r\nchiefly in colour, in lacking a non-silicious skeleton, and in their\r\ngenerative process, which for the most part consists in the conjugation\r\nof two similar cells. Diatoms, on the other hand, have dense silicious\r\nskeletons and a general absence of green colouring matter. Ralfs, in\r\nhis systematic monograph, enumerates twenty genera of desmids. The\r\nlimiting membrane is alike firm and flexible, since it exhibits some\r\nelasticity and resistance to pressure, and is not readily decomposable.\r\nTraces of silica are found in only a few of the desmids, while the\r\nfrustule of the diatom is chiefly composed of this substance; both\r\nhave an external membranous covering, so transparent and homogeneous\r\nin structure as to be in danger of being entirely overlooked, unless\r\nsome staining material is used, together with a high-power objective\r\npossessing considerable penetration. In some species, however, the\r\nmucous covering is more clearly defined, as in Staurastrum and\r\n_Didymoprium Grevelli_. Openings occur in the outer membrane of other\r\nspecies, as the Closterium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nDESMIDIACEÆ.]\r\n\r\nMany species of desmids have a power of motion, the cause of which must\r\nbe due either to cilia or a flagellate organ. This, however, is denied\r\nby some observers, who regard their movements as due to an exudation\r\nof the mucilaginous contents of the cell, to exosmose, or diffusion,\r\nneither of which hypotheses will at all help us to understand the\r\ngliding movements of the Oscillariæ or the sharp jerky movement of the\r\nSchizonema. The movements of desmids are especially exerted when in\r\nthe act of dividing, and by sunlight, towards which they are always\r\nobserved to move. The force with which some diatoms move about is very\r\ngreat, and this can only be satisfactorily explained by admitting a\r\nspecialised organ.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Desmidiaceæ (Plate X.) is much modified by\r\ntheir eminences, depressions, and processes, as well as that of the\r\nsurface, the margin of the fronds, and the depth and width of the\r\ncentral constriction. The surfaces may be dotted over irregularly,\r\nthe dots themselves being elevated or depressed points in their\r\nstructural character. The margins of some have a dentate appearance,\r\nas in Cosmarium. In the elongated forms, such as Penium, the puncta\r\nare disposed in lines parallel to the length. In several these lines\r\nare either elevations or furrows, it is not always easy to say which;\r\nthey are peculiar, however, to the elongated forms of Closterium.\r\nWhen the lines are fine they produce a striation of the surface, but\r\nin order to discover this the fronds should be viewed when empty and\r\nby a fairly good power. The modification of surface in several genera\r\nseems to be due, not to mere simple appendages, but to expansion of the\r\nlimiting membrance into thickened processes, and which may terminate\r\nin spines, as in Xanthidium and Staurastrum (Plate X., Nos. 8-19 and\r\n22). A general distribution over the surface is characteristic of the\r\nformer, but in Euastrum the surfaces are very irregular, and therefore\r\ndescribed as “swellings or inflations.” Micrasterias has its margin\r\ndeeply incised into lobes, which in some have a radiating arrangement;\r\nwhen the lobes on the margin are small they constitute crenations or\r\ndentations. The fronds of _Euastrum binatum_ are bicrenate on the\r\nsides, as are those of Desmidium and Hyalotheca and other species.\r\nAnother variety of margin exists, known as undulating or wavy, while\r\nthe general concavity or convexity of the margins furnish other\r\nspecific characteristics.\r\n\r\n_Pediastreæ_ (Plate X., Nos. 24-29).--The members of this family\r\nformerly included the Micrasterias and Arthrodesmius of Ehrenberg.\r\nFrom their arrangement of cells in determinate numbers and definite\r\nforms, it has been thought by some observers that they should be\r\nremoved from the desmids to a special or sub-family. The points\r\nof difference consist in the firmness of the outer covering, in\r\nthe frequent interruptions on the margin of the cells, and in the\r\nprotrusion of “horns,” or rather a notch more or less deep. It is true\r\nthat the cells are not made up of two symmetrical halves, and that\r\nthey are in aggregation, which is not (except in the Scenedesmus, a\r\ngenus that distinctly connects this group with desmids) in linear\r\nseries, but in the form of discoidal fronds. They, however, divide\r\ninto 8, 16, or 32 gonidia, and these move about for some time before\r\nthe formation of a new frond. It was Nägeli who first instituted a\r\nsub-genus of Pediastrum, under the designation of Anomopedium, the\r\nchief characteristic of which is the absence of bilobed peripheral\r\ncells. In Cœlastrum the cells are hexangular, the central ones very\r\nregularly so; in Sorastrum they are wedge-shaped, or triangular, with\r\nrounded-off angles. Viewed laterally the cells appear oblong. The cells\r\nof Pediastrum are considerably compressed, so that when aggregated\r\nthey form a flattened tubular structure; in figure they are polygonal,\r\nfrequently hexagonal, a shape owing, in all probability, to mutual\r\nlateral pressure during growth. There is a pervading uniformity in\r\nthe contents of the cells of the different genera, which consist of\r\nprotoplasmic endochrome. At first the colour is pale green, but it\r\nbecomes deeper with full maturity, while the decaying cells are seen\r\nto change to a deep reddish-yellow or brown. The protoplasm is also\r\nclear and homogeneous, but in time granules appear, enlarge, and\r\nmultiply in number; moreover, each cell presents a single bright green\r\nvesicle, around which are collected clear circular spaces or globules,\r\nrecalling those of Closterium, and varying in number from two to six or\r\nmore, their position not being regulated by the partition wall as in\r\nPalmellæ, but by the centre of the entire frond. Oil globules are also\r\ncontained in the cells; their presence is indicated by the addition of\r\na drop of tincture of iodine. On one occasion Nägeli saw in _Pediastrum\r\nboryanum_ the endochrome disposed in a radiating manner, an arrangement\r\nwhich often obtains in algals and in other vegetable cells with a\r\ncentral nucleus. The cells of Pediastreæ are always united together in\r\ncompound fronds, as represented in Plate X., Nos. 24 and 29.[56]\r\n\r\nThe differences pointed out in no way constitute a claim to remove\r\nPediastreæ from among Desmidiaceæ, certainly not to rank as a distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Reproduction of Desmidiaceæ._--A true reproductive act is presented\r\nby the conjugation or coupling of two fronds, and by the resulting\r\ndevelopment of a sporangium and subsequent interchange of the contents\r\nof the two cells. At another time self-division is frequently seen\r\nto take place in all respects as in the cells of other algæ. The\r\nproceeding is varied in some essential particulars by the form of\r\nthe fronds and by other circumstances; as in fission of Euastrum,\r\nfor instance (seen in Plate X., Nos. 1, 2, and 12), when the narrow\r\nconnecting bands between the two segments of the fronds are rapidly\r\npushed aside by growth and finally divide. Two modes of conjugation of\r\nfronds are represented in Plate X., Nos. 25 and 33, in Closterium and\r\nPenium. The act of conjugation admits of variations in character, as\r\nshown in Staurastrum and Microsterias; the contents of both fronds are\r\ndischarged into a delicate intermediate sac; this gradually thickens\r\nand produces spines (Plate X., Nos. 8 and 19). In Didymoprium the\r\nseparate joints unite by a narrow process pushed out from each other,\r\noften of considerable length, through which the endochrome of one\r\ncell is transferred to the other, and thus a sporangium is produced\r\nwithin one of two cells, just as in the conjugatæ (No. 5). In _Penium\r\nJennereri_ the conjugation takes a varied form; the fronds do not open\r\nand gape at the suture, but couple by small but distinct cylindrical\r\ntubes (No. 27).\r\n\r\nAmong those enumerated, the compressed and deeply constricted cells\r\nof Euastrum offer the more favourable opportunities for studying the\r\nmanner of their division; for although the frond is really a single\r\ncell, in all its stages it appears like two, the segments being\r\nalways distinct, from the earliest stage. The segments, however, are\r\nseparated by a connecting link, which is subsequently converted into\r\ntwo somewhat round hyaline bodies. These bodies gradually increase and\r\nacquire colour, and as they grow the original segments are further\r\ndivided, and at length become disconnected, each taking a new segment\r\nto supply the place of that from which it is separated. It is curious\r\nto trace the progressive development of the newer portions, which at\r\nfirst are devoid of all colour; but as they become larger a faint green\r\ntint is observed, which gradually darkens, and then assumes a granular\r\nappearance. Soon the new segments attain their normal size, while the\r\ncovering in some species shows the presence of puncta. In Xanthidium,\r\nPlate X., Nos. 9, 10, and Staurastrum, Nos. 15-18, the spines and\r\nprocesses make their appearance last, beginning as mere tubercles, and\r\nthen lengthening until they attain their perfect form and size, armed\r\nwith setæ; but complete separation frequently occurs before growth is\r\nfully completed. This singular process is repeated again and again, so\r\nthat the older segments are united successively, as it were, with many\r\ngenerations. When the cells approach maturity, molecular movements may\r\nbe at times noticed in their contents, precisely similar to what Agardh\r\nand others aptly term “swarming.” Meyen describes this granular matter\r\nas starch.[57] Closterium, early in the spring, when freshly secured\r\nand exposed to light, presents a wonderful appearance, these bodies\r\nbeing kept continually in motion at both ends of the frustule by the\r\nciliary action within the cell, and the whole frond is seen brilliantly\r\nglittering with active cilia. When a gleam of stronger light is\r\nallowed for a moment to fall on the frond, the rapid undulations of\r\nthe cilia produce a series of most delicate prismatic Newton’s rings.\r\nThe action and distribution of the cilia, together with the cyclosis\r\nof the granular bodies in the frond, are better seen by the aid of\r\nWenham’s parabola or a good condenser with a central stop. One of the\r\nwide angular objectives shows the circulation around the marginal\r\nportions of the whole frond. The stream is seen to be running up the\r\nmore external portion, internal to which is another stream following a\r\ncontrary direction; this action, confined to the space between the mass\r\nof endochrome and the outer portion of the cell-wall, is seen to pass\r\nabove or around the space in which cyclosis of the spores is taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1854, the late Rev. Lord Sidney Godolphin\r\nOsborne and myself became much interested in the remarkable family of\r\nClosteria. Fig. 292 is a highly magnified view of _Closterium lunula_\r\nwhich I drew by the aid of the camera-lucida at the time. There could\r\nbe no doubt about the ciliary action within the frond: it was in\r\nevery way similar to that of the branchiæ of the muscle, the same\r\nwavy motion, which gradually became slower as the death of the desmid\r\ndrew near. This was brought about earlier when the cell was not kept\r\nsupplied with fresh water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.--_Closterium lunula._]\r\n\r\nIn diagram A, line _b_ points to a cluster of ovoid bodies; these\r\nare seen at intervals throughout the endochrome within the investing\r\nmembrane. These bodies are attached to the membrane by small pedicles,\r\nand are occasionally seen in motion about the spot, from which they\r\neventually break away, and are carried off, by the circulating fluid,\r\nto the chambers at the extremities of the frond; there they join a\r\ncrowd of similar bodies, in constant motion within the chambers, when\r\nthe specimen is quite fresh. That the action of these free granules or\r\nspores is “Brownian,” as surmised by some writers, is in my opinion\r\nentirely fallacious. It is doubtless in a measure due to the current\r\nbrought about by the ciliary motion of the more fluid contents of the\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nThe circulation, when made out over the centre of the frond, for\r\ninstance at _a_, is in appearance of a wholly different nature from\r\nthat seen at the edges. In the latter the matter circulated is that\r\nof granules, passing each other in distinct lines, but in opposite\r\ndirections; in the circulation as seen at _a_, the streams are broad,\r\ntortuous, of far greater body, and passing with much less rapidity. To\r\nsee the centre circulation, use a Gillett’s illuminator and a 1/8th or\r\na 1/10th immersion; work the fine adjustment so as to bring the centre\r\nof the frond into focus, then almost lose it by raising the objective;\r\nafter this, with great care, work the milled head until the darker body\r\nof the endochrome is clearly brought out.\r\n\r\nAt B is an enlarged sketch of one extremity of the frond. The arrows\r\nwithin the chamber pointing to _b_ denote the direction of a strong\r\ncurrent of fluid, which can be occasionally followed throughout. It is\r\nacted upon by cilia at the edges of the chamber, the greater impetus\r\nappearing to come from the centre of the endochrome. The fluid is here\r\nacting in positive jets, that is, with an almost arterial action; and\r\naccording to the strength with which it is propelled at the time, the\r\nloose floating bodies are sent to a greater or less distance from the\r\nend of the frustule; the fluid is thus impelled from a centre, and kept\r\nin activity by the lateral cilia, that create a rapid current and give\r\na turning motion to the free bodies. The line--_a_, in this diagram,\r\ndenotes the outline of the membrane which encloses the endochrome; on\r\nboth sides cilia can be seen. The circulation exterior to it passes and\r\nrepasses in opposite directions, in three or four distinct courses;\r\nthese, when they arrive at--_c_, seem to encounter a stream making\r\nits way towards an aperture at the apex of the chamber; then they\r\nappear to be driven back again by a stronger force. Some, however, do\r\noccasionally enter the chamber, but very rarely will one of the bodies\r\nescape into the outer current, and should it do so, is carried about\r\nuntil it becomes adherent to the side wall of the frond.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the propagation of the _C. lunula_, I have never seen\r\nanything like conjugation; but I have repeatedly seen self-division\r\n(shown at D _a_ _a_). This act is chiefly the work of one half of\r\nthe frond. Having watched for some time, one half is seen to remain\r\npassive, while the other has a lateral motion from side to side, as if\r\nmoving on an axis at the point of juncture; the motion increases, is\r\nmore active, until at last with a jerk one segment separates itself\r\nfrom the other, as seen at E. It will be noticed that each end of the\r\nsegment is perfectly closed before separation finally takes place;\r\nthere is, however, only one perfect chamber, that belonging to the\r\nextremity of the original entire frond. The circulation continues\r\nfor some time previous to and after subdivision, in both fronds, and\r\nby almost imperceptible degrees increases in volume. From the end of\r\nthe endochrome symptoms of elongation of the frond take place, the\r\nsemi-lunar form gradually changes, elongates, and is more defined,\r\nuntil it takes the form and outline of the fully-formed frustule at\r\nthe extremity. The obtuse end--_b_ of the other portion of frond is at\r\nthe same time elongating and contracting, and in a few hours from the\r\ndivision of the one segment from the other the appearance of each half\r\nis that of a nearly perfect frustule, the chamber at the new end is\r\ncomplete, the globular circulation exterior to it becomes affected by\r\nthe circulation from within the said chamber, and, shortly afterwards,\r\nsome of the free bodies descend, and become exposed to the current\r\nalready going on in the chamber. E is a diagram of one end of a _C.\r\ndidymotocum_, in which the same process was well marked, and completed\r\nwhile it was under observation.\r\n\r\nIt will appear to most observers that if the continuation of the\r\nwidely-spread family of Desmidiaceæ was wholly dependent upon\r\nconjugation and subdivision of their frustules, a process requiring\r\nseveral hours for its completion, the whole species must have long\r\nago disappeared. It may be presumed then that some other mode of\r\nreproduction must prevail. In the fresh-water algæ the two more general\r\nmethods of multiplication are clearly governed by the conditions of\r\nthe seasons; the resting-spores securing continuity of life during\r\nthe winter, the swarm-spores spreading the plant profusely during the\r\nwarmer portion of the year, when rapid growth is possible. I therefore\r\nregard the actively swarming bodies seen in continuous motion at the\r\ntwo extreme portions of the frustule of _Closterium lunula_ as being\r\neither oospores or zoospores, by means of which reproduction takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n=Diatomaceæ=, commonly called brittleworts, Plate XI., are chiefly\r\ncomposed of two symmetrical valves, narrow and wand-like, navicular,\r\nminiature boat-shaped, hence their name _Navicula_ (little ship).\r\nHitherto they have excited the deepest interest among microscopists\r\nbecause of their wonderfully minute structure, and the difficulty\r\ninvolved in determining their exact nature and formation. Each\r\nindividual diatom has a silicious skeleton, spoken of as a frustule,\r\nfrond, or cell, having a rectangular or prismatic form, which mostly\r\nobtains in the whole family, the angles of the junction of the two\r\nunited valves being, as a rule, acute, and enclosing a yellowish-brown\r\nendochrome. Deeply-notched frustules, like those of the Desmidiaceæ, do\r\nnot occur, and the production of spines and tubercles so common in that\r\nfamily is rare in the Diatomaceæ. Great variety of outline prevails, so\r\nmuch so that no rule in this respect can be formulated.\r\n\r\nThe frustules, however, are usually composed of two equal and\r\nsimilar halves, but exceptions to this are found in the Actinomtheæ,\r\nCocconcidæ, and one or two other families. The extremities of some\r\nspecies, _e.g._, Nitzshia and Pleurosigma, are extremely elongated,\r\nforming long, filiform, tubular processes; in Biddulphia and\r\nRizoselenia, short tubular processes from their margins. Great variety\r\nof outline may prevail in a genus, so considerable indeed that no\r\naccurate definition can be given, the characteristics shading off\r\nthrough several species until the similarity to an assumed typical\r\nform is much diminished, which may again be modified by accidental\r\ncircumstances that surround the development of the silicious frustule.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the figure is greatly modified or\r\nentirely changed by the position of the valves, whether seen in one\r\nposition or another, as already explained in connection with “Errors\r\nof Interpretation.” Again, in the genera Navicula, Pinnularia (Plate\r\nII., Nos. 33, 38, and 40), and others, the frustules are in one aspect\r\nboat-shaped, but in the other either oblong with truncated ends, or\r\nprismatic. In the genus Triceratium (Plate XI., No. 10), the difference\r\nof figure is very remarkable as the front or side view is examined.\r\n\r\nThe sudden change in appearance presented to the eye as the frustule\r\nis seen to roll over is rather peculiar. As a rule, therefore, we must\r\nexamine all specimens in every aspect, to accomplish which very shallow\r\ncells should be selected, say of 1/100th of an inch deep, and covered\r\nwith glass 1/250th of an inch thick. A good penetrating objective\r\nshould be used, and careful illumination obtained. The Diatomaceæ are\r\nperhaps more widely distributed than any other class of infusorial\r\nlife; they are found in fresh, salt, and brackish water; many grow\r\nattached to other bodies by a stalk (Plate II., No. 33, Licmophora and\r\nAchnanthidium); while others, as Pleurosigma, No. 40, swim about freely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nDIATOMACEÆ, RECENT AND FOSSIL.]\r\n\r\nThere are a considerable number of Diatomaceæ which, when in the young\r\nstate, are enclosed in a muco-gelatinous sheath; while others are\r\nattached by stipes or stalk to algæ. It would be vain, in a limited\r\nspace, to attempt a description of this numerous and extensive family.\r\nNägeli and other observers describe a “mucilaginous pellicle on the\r\ninner layer of the valves,” while, as Menghine observes, “an organic\r\nmembrane ought to exist both inside and outside, for the silica could\r\nnot become solid except by crystallizing or depositing itself on some\r\npre-existing substance.” The surface of the frustules is generally\r\nvery beautifully sculptured, and the markings assume the appearance\r\nof dots (puncta), stripes (striæ), ribs (costæ), pinnules (pinnæ),\r\nof furrows and fine lines; longitudinal, transverse, and radiating\r\nbands; canals or canaliculi; and of cells or areolæ; whilst all present\r\nstriking varieties and modifications in their form, character, and\r\ndegree of development. Again, the fine lines or striæ of many frustules\r\nare resolvable into rows of minute dots or perforations, as occur in\r\n_Pleurosigma angulatum_, delineated in the accompanying microphotograph\r\n(Fig. 294), taken for the author purposely to show the markings on this\r\nespecially selected test diatom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293.\r\n\r\n1. _Pleurosigma attenuatum_; 2. _Pleurosigma angulatum_; 3.\r\n_Pleurosigma Spencerii_. Magnified 450 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the markings on the diatom valves is one of considerable\r\ninterest, and attempts have been made to produce them artificially, but\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294.--_Pleurosigma angulatum_, magnified 4500\r\ndiameters.\r\n\r\n(From a microphotograph taken by Zeiss with the 2 mm. aprochromatic\r\nobjective, 1·30 numerical aperture, and projection eye-piece, No. 4.)]\r\n\r\nProfessor Max Schultze devoted a great amount of time to the\r\ninvestigation of the subject, and has recorded in a voluminous\r\npaper[58] the results of his observations. He says, “Most of the\r\nspecies of the Diatomaceæ are characterised by the presence on their\r\nouter surface of certain differences of relief, referable either\r\nto elevations or to depressions disposed in rows. The opinions of\r\nmicroscopists with respect to the nature of these markings are still\r\nsomewhat divided. Whilst in the larger forms, and those distinguished\r\nby their coarser dots, the appearance is manifestly due to the\r\nexistence of thinner spots in the valve, we cannot so easily explain\r\nthe cause of the striation or punctation in _Pleurosigma angulatum_ and\r\nsimilar finely-marked forms.”\r\n\r\nDr. R. Zeiss some time ago furnished me with a microphotograph of\r\na frustule magnified 4500 diameters that seemed to confirm Mr. T.\r\nF. Smith’s view of the structure of these valves. Dr. Van Heurck\r\nhas also made a study of this diatom, and concludes that the valves\r\nconsist of two membranes of thin films, and of an intermediate layer,\r\nthe outer being pierced with openings. The outer membrane is, he\r\nbelieves, “so delicate that it is easily destroyed by acid or by\r\nfriction, and the several processes employed in cleaning and preparing\r\nit for microscopical examination. When the openings or apertures of\r\nthe internal portion are arranged in alternate rows they assume the\r\nhexagonal form; when in straight rows, the openings are seen to be\r\nsquare or oblong.” A description hardly in accord with Fig. 294.\r\n\r\n\r\nMovements of Diatoms.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Smith, in his “Synopsis of Diatoms,” refers to their\r\nmovements in the following terms: “I am constrained to believe that\r\nthe movements observed in the Diatomaceæ are due to forces operating\r\nwithin the frustule, and are probably connected with the endosmotic\r\nand exosmotic action of the cells. The fluids which are concerned in\r\nthese actions must enter, and be emitted through the minute foramina at\r\nthe extremities of the silicious valves.” Schultze’s researches, which\r\nwere made at a later date, carried this debatable question somewhat\r\nfurther. He is of opinion “that a sarcode (protoplasmic) substance\r\nenvelops the external surface of the diatoms, and its movements are due\r\nto this agent exclusively.” His investigations were mainly confined\r\nto _P. angulatum_, and to the larger _P. attenuatum_ (Fig. 293, 1 and\r\n2), as the transverse markings on the frustule do not impede to so\r\ngreat an extent the observation of what is going on within. The living\r\nspecimen of _P. angulatum_ under the microscope usually has its broad\r\nside turned to view, with one long curved “raphe” uppermost, and the\r\nother in contact with the glass cover (Fig. 293). Within the frustule\r\nthe yellow colouring matter, “endochrome,” fills the cavity more or\r\nless completely. In the broader part of the frustule these bands\r\nof endochrome describe one or two complicated windings. It is only\r\npossible in those specimens in which the bands are narrow to properly\r\ntrace their foldings, and determine their number. The next objects\r\nwhich strike the eye on examining a freshly-gathered Pleurosigma are\r\nnumerous highly refractive oil-globules. These are not, however, all in\r\nthe same place, and one globule appears nearer the observer than the\r\nother; their relative position is best seen when a view of the narrow\r\nside of the frustule can be obtained, so that one raphe is to the left\r\nand the other to the right. The blue-black colour which is assumed by\r\nthese globules after treating with acid demonstrates their oleaginous\r\nnature. The middle of the cavity of the frustule is occupied, in the\r\nlarger navicula, by two large oil-globules (seen in the diagrammatic\r\nFig. 295), and by a colourless finely granular mass, whose position\r\nin the body is not so clearly seen in the flat view as in the side\r\nview. Besides the central mass, the conical cavities at either end of\r\nthe frustule are seen to enclose granular substance, and two linear\r\nextensions from each of three masses are developed, closely underlying\r\nthe raphæ. In the side view, therefore, they appear attached to the\r\nright and left edges of the interior of the frustule. This colourless\r\ngranular substance carries in its centre, near the middle part of the\r\ndiatom, an imperfectly developed nucleus which is not very easy to see,\r\nbut may be demonstrated by the application of an acid. The colourless\r\nsubstance is protoplasm, and encloses numerous small refractive\r\nparticles; this, on adding a drop of a one per cent. solution of\r\nosmic acid, is coloured blue-black, and proves to be fat. It is,\r\nhowever, exceedingly difficult to determine the exact limitations of\r\nthe protoplasm, on account of the highly refractive character of the\r\nsilicious skeleton, and the obstruction to the light presented by the\r\nendochrome.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance the protoplasm reappears, contracted into a\r\nconsiderable mass, within the terminal ends of the frustule. Schultze\r\nobserved in this part of the protoplasm a rapid molecular movement,\r\n“cyclosis,” such as occurs in Closterium, and also a current of the\r\ngranules of the protoplasm along the raphe. “_Pleurosigma angulatum\r\n‘crawls,’_ as do all diatoms possessing a raphe, along this line of\r\nsuture. To crawl along, it must have a fixed support.” “There is\r\nobviously,” adds Schultze, “but one explanation; it is clear that there\r\nmust be a band of protoplasm lying along the raphe, which causes the\r\nparticles of colouring matter to adhere, and gives rise to a gliding\r\nmovement. For there is but one phenomenon which can be compared with\r\nthe gliding motion of foreign bodies on the Diatomaceæ, and that is,\r\nthe clinging to and casting off of particles by the pseudopodia of the\r\nrhizopod, as observed, for instance, on placing a living Gromia or\r\nMiliolina in still water with finely-powdered carmine. The nature of\r\nthe adhesion and of the motion is in both cases the same. And since,\r\nwith diatoms as unicellular organisms, protoplasm forms a large part\r\nof the cell (in many cases two distinctly moving protoplasms), this\r\nimplies that the external movements are referable to the movements of\r\nthe protoplasm.” It is quite evident to those who have studied the\r\nmovements of diatoms that they are surrounded by a sarcode structure\r\nof a more pellucid character than that of Amœba. Six years before\r\nSchultze’s observations were published, I wrote in a third edition\r\nof my book, page 307, “The act of progression favours the notion of\r\ncontractile tentacular filaments--_pseudopodia_--as the organs of\r\nlocomotion and prehension.”\r\n\r\nSince my former observations on the movements of diatoms, I have given\r\nmuch attention to two forms, _P. angulatum_ and _Pinnularia_. The\r\npowers used were Hartnack’s No. 8, and Gunlack’s 1/16-inch immersion;\r\nGillett’s condenser illumination, with lamp flame edge turned to mirror\r\nand bull’s-eye lens; a perforated slide with a square of thin glass\r\n·006 cemented to it, and a cover-glass of ·005. So far as I could\r\nsatisfy myself, no terminal space, as in the Closteria, could be seen,\r\notherwise the course of the gemmules is as freely traced as in that\r\nform. They are more minute than the _Closterium lunula_ granules, more\r\nsteadily or slowly seen to pass up and down one half the frustule\r\ntowards the extremity, one half of the current seeming to turn round\r\nupon its axis and descending towards the other. The granules were\r\nthickly scattered at the apex, but gradually became fewer, and the\r\nascending and descending current tapered away towards the central\r\nnodule, which became more filled up or closed in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.--Outline sketches of Pinnulariæ, showing\r\nvesicles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.--_Gomphonema constrictum._ (From a\r\nmicrophotograph.)]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful sight was not confined to one frustule, but was\r\nexhibited in all that were in a healthy condition. I examined several,\r\nand watched them for a long time. The phenomenon described depends\r\nmuch upon the healthy condition of the frustule at the time; as the\r\nmovements of the diatoms became sluggish, the circulation gradually\r\nslackens and then ceases altogether. I also saw a somewhat similar\r\naction in the more active specimens of _P. hippocampus_ and _Navicula\r\ncuspidata_, but the coarser markings and thickness of the wall of these\r\ndiatoms seemed to place greater difficulties in the way of observation\r\nthan the finer valves of the _P. angulatum_. One thing I believe is\r\ncertain, that the circulation described is precisely similar to that\r\nseen in the Closteria, or, on a much larger scale, in Chara and the\r\nleaf of the Anacharis, bearing in mind also that in the Closterium\r\nthe cell is divided by a transverse suture, and in _P. angulatum_\r\nby a longitudinal one (Plate II., Nos. 38-40). About the same time\r\nsome very lively specimens of the Pinnulariæ were sent to me, and the\r\nmovements of these frustules were more closely observed. One or two\r\nof the more active would attack a body relatively larger than itself,\r\nit would also force its way into a mass of granular matter, and then\r\nrecede from it with a jerky motion. In more than one instance a cell\r\nof Palmoglæa was seized and carried away by the Pinnularia, the former\r\nat the time being actively engaged in the process of cell division.\r\nOther diatoms present among my specimens were also in an active\r\ncondition, and the circulation of granular matter in all was distinctly\r\nvisible. In the Pinnulariæ two large colourless vesicles were seen on\r\neither side of the median nodule, each having a central nucleus, as\r\nrepresented in the accompanying sketch, made while under observation\r\nin two positions. The central portion of each frustule was closely\r\npacked with a rich yellowish-brown coloured endochrome, interspersed\r\nwith a few fat globules. The phenomenon of cyclosis was not seen in\r\nany of these diatoms, but I have satisfied myself, by staining, of the\r\npresence of a delicately fine external protoplasmic covering in many\r\ndiatoms. That their movements resemble the gliding movements exhibited\r\nby the Amœba can scarcely be doubted. Numerous forms of Diatomaceæ are\r\nfound growing on or attached to water-plants or pieces of detached\r\nstalks, which, although generally simple, are sometimes compound,\r\ndividing and subdividing in a beautiful ramous manner. Pinnulariæ,\r\nNitzschia, &c., are seen adherent by one extremity, about which they\r\nturn or bend themselves as on a hinge. By the process of cell-division,\r\ngroups of Synedræ become attached by a point, in a fan-like form.\r\nThe fan-like collection of frustules is said to be flabellate, or\r\nradiate. In Licmophora, Achnanthes and other species (Plate II., Nos.\r\n29-33) the double condition of union of frustules and of attachment by\r\na pedicle are illustrated. When a stipe branches it does so normally\r\nin a dichotomous manner, each new individual being produced by a\r\nsecondary pedicle. This regular dichotomy is seen in several genera:\r\nCocconema and Gomphonema, the latter more perfectly in Fig. 296, from a\r\nmicrophotograph, in which a branching, or rather longitudinal, rupture\r\nof the pedicle takes place at intervals, and the entire organism\r\npresents a more or less complete flabella, or fan-like cluster, on the\r\nsummit of the branches, and imperfect or single frustules irregularly\r\nscattered throughout the whole length of the pedicle.\r\n\r\n_Isthmia enervis_ (Fig. 297).--The unicellular frustule of this species\r\nis extremely difficult to define, owing to the large areolations of the\r\nvalves; it has a remarkable internal structure. The olive-brown cell\r\ncontents are found collected, for the most part, into a central mass,\r\nfrom which radiating, branched, granular threads extend to and unite\r\nwith the periphery. When viewed by a magnifying power of 600 or 700\r\ndiameters, these prolongations are seen to be composed of aggregations\r\nof ovate or spindle-shaped corpuscles, held together by protoplasmic\r\nmatter. These bodies are sometimes quiescent, but more often travel\r\nslowly to and fro from the central mass. The general aspect under these\r\nconditions so nearly corresponds to the characteristic circulation in\r\nthe frustules of unicellular plants and of certain rhizopoda, that it\r\nis difficult to realise that the object when under examination is an\r\nelegant marine diatom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.--_Isthmia enervis._ Microphotograph.]\r\n\r\nThere is a large section of diatoms in which the frustules are\r\ndiffused throughout a muco-gelatinous envelope in a definite manner.\r\nHistologically this is homologous with the pedicles and connecting\r\nnodules thrown out during the act of self-division, and in some species\r\n(Cocconeis, Fragillaria, &c.) it often persists after that act is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiatomaceæ, Recent and Fossil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.--Fossil Diatoms from Springfield (Barbadoes).\r\n\r\n1, Achnanthidium; 2, _Diatoma vulgare_, side view and front view; 3,\r\nBiddulphia; 4, 5, 6, 7, _Amphitetias antediluviana_, front view, with\r\nglobular and oval forms; _Gomphonema elongatum_ and _capitatum_.]\r\n\r\n_Fossilised Diatomaceæ._--Dr. Gregory was of opinion that a large\r\nnumber of diatoms separated into species are only transition forms,\r\nand more extended observations have proved that form and outline are\r\nnot always to be trusted in this matter. Species-making is a modern\r\ninvention, and can hardly apply to the indestructible fossilised forms\r\nof the frustules of Diatomaceæ, with their beautiful sculpturings and\r\ngeometrical constructions, which have not been materially changed since\r\nthey were first deposited. Startling and almost incredible as the\r\nassertion may appear to some, it is none the less a fact established\r\nbeyond all question, that some of the most gigantic mountain-ranges,\r\nas the mighty Andes, towering into space 25,250 feet above the level\r\nof the sea, their base occupying vast areas of land; as also massive\r\nlimestone rocks; the sand that covers boundless deserts; and the soil\r\nof many wide-extended plains, are each and all principally composed of\r\nDiatomaceæ. And, as Dr. Buckland once observed: “The remains of such\r\nminute animals have added much more to the mass of materials which\r\ncompose the exterior crust of the globe than the bones of elephants,\r\nhippopotami, and whales.”\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the late Mr. Sollitt, of Hull, discovered the beautiful\r\nlongitudinal and transverse _striæ_ (markings) on the _Pleurosigma\r\nhippocampus_. A curved graceful line runs down the shell, in the centre\r\nof which is an expanded oval opening. Near to the central opening the\r\ndots elongate crossways, presenting the appearance of small short bands.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of this town many interesting varieties of Diatomaceæ\r\nhave been found, the beauty of the varied forms of which are constantly\r\nunder investigation; at the same time some of them are highly useful,\r\nas forming that class of _test objects_ which are better calculated\r\nthan many others for determining the excellence and powers of certain\r\nobjectives. Mr. Sollitt carefully measured the markings on some of the\r\nfrustules and found they ranged between the 1/30000th and 1/130000th of\r\nan inch; the _Pleurosigma strigilis_ having the strongest markings, and\r\nthe _Pleurosigma acus_ the finest.\r\n\r\nMr. J. D. Sollitt not only first proposed their use, but he also\r\nfurnished the measurements of the lines of the several members of this\r\nfamily, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Amphipleura pellucida, or Acus, 130,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"       sigmoidea, 70,000 in the inch.\r\n  Navicula rhomboides, 111,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n  Pleurosigma fasciola, fine shell, 86,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"          \"   strong shell, 64,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"       strigosum, 72,000 in the inch, diagonal lines.\r\n      \"       angulatum, 51,000 in the inch, diagonal lines.\r\n      \"       quadratum, 50,000 in the inch, diagonal lines.\r\n      \"       Spencerii, 50,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"       attenuatum, 42,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"       Balticum, 40,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n      \"       formosum, 32,000 in the inch, diagonal lines.\r\n      \"       strigilis, 30,000 in the inch, cross lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nMICRO-PHOTOGRAPH OF TEST DIATOMS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLichenaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe lichens are a family of autonomous plants, an intermediary group of\r\nalgals or cellular cryptogams, drawing their nourishment from the air\r\nthrough their whole surface medium, and propagating by spores usually\r\nenclosed in asci, and always having green gonidia in their thallus.\r\nTheir gonidia, bright coloured globular cells, form layers under the\r\ncortical covering of the thallus, and generally develop in the form\r\nof incrustations, which cover stones, wood, and the bark of trees,\r\nor penetrate into the lamellæ of the epidermis of woody plants. The\r\ngonidia of lichens partake of both the character of vegetative and\r\nreproductive cells.\r\n\r\nThe thallus in the fructicose group attaches itself by a narrow base,\r\ngrowing in the form of a miniature shrub. Another group is met with\r\nin a slimy condition--the gelatinous lichens. These species, for the\r\nmost part, furnished dyes before the discovery of the coal-tar dyes.\r\nIn many of the _Palmella cruenta_, commonly found growing on the walls\r\nand roofs of houses, a colourless acid liquid is found, which, on being\r\ntreated with alkali, produces a bright yellow colour; and another,\r\n_Avernia vulpina_, furnishes a brown dye; the _Rocella fuciformis_\r\nand _R. tinctoria_ yield the purple dye substance known as orchil, or\r\narchil, from which the useful blue paper of the chemist for testing\r\nacidity is manufactured. Usnic acid, combined with green and yellow\r\nresins, seems to be more or less a constituent of many lichens.\r\n\r\nA vertical section of _Palmella stellata_ is given in Plate I., No.\r\n26, in which the emission of the ripe spores of the lichens is seen\r\nto be not unlike that which takes place in some of the fungi, Pezizæ,\r\nSphæriæ, &c. If a portion of the thallus be moistened and placed in a\r\ncommon phial, with the apotheca turned toward one side, in a few hours\r\nthe opposite surface of the glass will be found covered with patches of\r\nspores, easily perceptible by their colour; or if placed on a moistened\r\nsurface, and one of the usual glass slips laid over it, the latter\r\nwill be covered in a short time. As to the powers of dissemination of\r\nthese lowly organised plants, an observation led to the conclusion\r\nthat the gonidia of lichens have greater powers in this direction\r\nthan was formerly supposed. It is found that by placing a clean sheet\r\nof glass in the open air during a fall of snow, and receiving the\r\nmelting water in a tube or bottle, quantities of what has been looked\r\nupon as a “unicellular plant” can be taken, the cells of which may be\r\nkept in a dormant condition for a long time during cold weather, but\r\nupon the return of spring warmth and moisture they begin to increase,\r\nby a process of subdivision, into two, four or eight portions; these\r\nsoon assume a rounded form, and burst the parent cell-wall open; these\r\nsecondary cells then begin to divide and subdivide again, and the\r\nprocess may go on without much variation for a long time. The phenomena\r\ndescribed may be watched by taking a portion of the bark of a tree on\r\nwhich Chlorococcus has been deposited, and placing it under a glass to\r\nkeep it in a moderately moist atmosphere; the only difference being a\r\nchange in colour, caused by the growth of the fibres, as may be seen\r\non microscopical examination. “And this,” says Dr. Hicks, who first\r\nobserved this phenomenon in plant life, “is an instructive point,\r\nbecause it will be found that the colour varies notably according to\r\nthe lichen prevalent in its neighbourhood.”[59] He believes there can\r\nbe no doubt that what has been called Chlorococcus is nothing more\r\nthan the gonidia of a lichen; and that under suitable conditions,\r\nchiefly drought and warmth, the gonidium often throws out from its\r\nexternal envelope a small fibre, which, adhering and branching, forms\r\na “soridium.” “The soridia remain dormant for a very long time, and\r\ndo not develop into thalli unless in a favourable situation, in some\r\ncases it may be for years. It will be perceived that the soridium\r\ncontains all the elements of a thallus in miniature; in fact, a thallus\r\ndoes frequently arise from one alone, and the fibres of neighbouring\r\nsoridia interlace; thus a thallus is matured very rapidly. This is\r\none of the causes of the variation of appearance so common in many\r\nspecies of lichens, more readily seen towards the centre of the parent\r\nthallus. When the gonidia remain attached to the parent thallus, the\r\ncircumstances are, of course, more favourable, and they develop into\r\nsecondary thalli, attached more or less to the older one, which, in\r\nmany instances, decays beneath them. This process being continued\r\nyear after year gives an apparent thickness and spongy appearance to\r\nthe lichen, and is the principal cause of the various modifications in\r\nthe external aspect of the lichens which caused them formerly to be\r\nmisunderstood and wrongly classified.”[60]\r\n\r\nThe erratic lichens are found among the genus Palmella, some of which\r\ngrow among boulders of the primary and metamorphic formations, curled\r\nup into a ball, and only fixed to their matrix by a slender thread. The\r\nglobular _Lecanora esculenta_ will at times suddenly cover large tracts\r\nof country in Persia and Tartary, where it is eaten by the cattle.\r\nDuring a scarcity of food a shower of these lichens, Mr. Berkeley tells\r\nus, fell at Erzeroum, and saved the cattle from starvation.[61]\r\n\r\nAnother group of the Palmella, or Peltigeri, so named from the\r\ntarget-like discs on their surface, spread their foliaceous fronds\r\nover the ground, and as the fruit is marginal, it gives the thallus\r\na digitate appearance. These are often spotted over by a little red\r\nfungus. The Lecidinei contains numerous species of the most varied\r\nhabits, and always crustaceous, and so closely adherent to the hard\r\nrocks and stones on which they grow, that at length they disintegrate\r\nthem. From this low species a higher form arises, with erect branching\r\nstems, and clothed with foliaceous, brightly-coloured scales.\r\n\r\nThe Coccocarpei is mainly distinguished by having orbicular discs\r\nentirely deprived of the cortical envelope called an excipulum. The\r\ndiscs spring at once from the medullary stratum, and contain asci and\r\nsporidia similar to those of the minute fungi Sphæriæ. Some of the\r\nlichens are themselves parasitic, and begin existence under the thick\r\nskin of the leaves of tropical plants, and spread encrusting thallus\r\nover their surface, the excipulum and perithecia being black; but\r\nin most cases these are beautifully sculptured, and are interesting\r\nobjects for the microscope. Indeed, the sphere-bearing lichens,\r\nwith upright stems bearing globular fruit at the extremity of their\r\nbranches, are at first indicated by a swelling, but in time the outer\r\nlayer bursts and exposes sporidia, which are beautiful objects under\r\nthe microscope on account of their spherical form and more or less deep\r\nblue tint. Humble and lowly as lichens may appear to be, they have been\r\ndivided into fifty-eight or more genera and 2,500 species. The brothers\r\nTulasne, De Bary, the Rev. Mr. Berkeley, and others, devoted great\r\nattention to the peculiarities of their structure and natural history.\r\n\r\n_Hepaticæ._--An intermediary group of much interest to the microscopist\r\nare the Hepaticæ (liverworts). These are found growing on damp rocks in\r\nthe neighbourhood of springs and dripping banks. The scale-moss, the\r\n_Marchantia polymorphia_ (Fig. 299), may be taken as typical of this\r\nlittle group, with its gemmiparous conceptacles and lobed receptacles,\r\nbearing archegones on transparent glass-like fruit stalks, carrying on\r\ntheir summits either round shield-like discs or radiating bodies with a\r\nstriking resemblance to a wheel without its tyre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.--_Marchantia polymorphia._]\r\n\r\nThe liverworts are closely allied to the mosses, and as much difficulty\r\nwas experienced in dividing the two, Hooker placed the whole under one\r\ngenus, the Jungermannia. More recently, however, they have been divided\r\ninto those with a stem and leaves confluent in a frond, Marchantia;\r\nthose with stem and leaves distinct, Jungermannia; and those with a\r\nsolitary capsule, filiform, bivalved, stalked, with a free central\r\nplacentation, Anthocotaceæ. Some botanists have further divided them,\r\nbut they are all extensively propagated by gemmæ.\r\n\r\nThe fronds carry the male organs, or _antherids_, and the disc, in the\r\nfirst instance, bears the female organs, or _archegones_, and after\r\na time gives place to the _sporanges_, or spore cases. It is these\r\nbodies which are of so much interest to microscopists; if the plant is\r\nbrought into a warm room, they suddenly burst open with some violence\r\nthe moment a drop of water is applied to them, and the sporanges are\r\ndispersed in a small cloud of brownish dust. If this dust is examined\r\nunder a medium power, it is seen to consist of a number of chain-like\r\nbodies, somewhat like the spring of a small watch; and if the process\r\nof bursting be closely watched, these minute springs will be found\r\ntwisting and curling about in every direction. The structure of the\r\nfrond itself will be seen to be interesting when cut in the vertical\r\ndirection and placed under the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.--Gemmiparous conceptacle of _Marchantia\r\npolymorphia_, expanding and rising from the surface of a frond. In the\r\ninterior are seen gopidial gemmæ already detached by the splitting of\r\nthe epiderm.]\r\n\r\nThe gemmæ of _Marchantia polymorphia_ are produced in elegant\r\nmembranous cups, with a toothed margin growing on the upper surface\r\nof the frond, especially in very damp courtyards between the stones,\r\nor near running water, where its lobed fronds are found covering\r\nextensive tracts of moist soil. At the period of fructification the\r\nfronds send up stalks, which carry at their summit round shield-like\r\nradiating discs, which bear upon their surface a number of little\r\nopen basket-shaped “conceptacles.” These again expand into singularly\r\ngraceful cups (as in Fig. 300), and are found in all stages of\r\ndevelopment. When mature, the basket contains a number of little green\r\nround or oblong discs, each composed of two or more layers of cells;\r\nthe wall itself being surmounted by a glistening fringe of teeth, whose\r\nedges are themselves regularly fringed with minute outgrowths. The cup\r\nseems to be formed by a development of the superior epidermis, which is\r\nraised up, and finally bursts and spreads out, laying bare the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe archegones of Marchantia are very curious bodies, while the elater\r\nand spores are even still more so. These are elongated cells, each\r\ncontaining a double spiral fibre coiled up in the interior. It is the\r\nelasticity of this which tears apart the cell-membrane, and sends\r\nforth the spores with a jerk, and thus assists in their dispersion.\r\nMarchantia is the type of the malloid Hepaticæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusci, Bryophyta.\r\n\r\nMosses are a beautiful class of non-vascular cryptogams. Linnæus\r\ncalled them _servi_, servants or workmen, as they seem to labour to\r\nproduce vegetation in places where soil is not already formed. The\r\nBryophyta form three natural divisions: the Bryinæ, or true mosses;\r\nthe Sphagnaceæ, or peat-mosses; and the Hepaticæ, or liverworts. The\r\ntwo first are commonly united. In these the sexual organs consist of\r\nantheridia and archegonia, but they are of simpler structure than will\r\nbe found in ferns; and the first generation from the spore is asexual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.--Screw-moss.]\r\n\r\nThe common or wall screw-moss (Fig. 301) grows almost everywhere, and\r\nif examined closely, is seen to have springing from its base numerous\r\nvery slender stems, each terminating in a dark brown case, which\r\nencloses antheroids. If a patch of the moss is gathered when in this\r\nstate, and the green part of the base is put into water, the threads of\r\nthe fringe will uncoil and disentangle themselves in a most curious and\r\nbeautiful manner; from this circumstance the plant takes its popular\r\nname of screw-moss. The leaf usually consists of either a single or a\r\ndouble layer of cells, having flattened sides, by which they adhere\r\none to another. The leaf-cells (Fig. 302) of the Sphagnum or bog-moss\r\nexhibit a curious departure from the ordinary type; they are large,\r\npolygonal, and elongated, and contain spiral fibres loosely coiled in\r\ntheir interior. The young leaf does not differ from the older; both are\r\nevolved by a gradual process of differentiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.--Section of leaf of Sphagnum moss, showing\r\nlarge cells of spiral fibres and connecting apertures.]\r\n\r\nMosses, like liverworts, possess both antheridia and pistillida,\r\nwhich are engaged in the process of fructification. The fertilized\r\ncell becomes gradually developed into a conical body elevated upon a\r\nfootstalk, the walls of the flask-shaped body carrying the higher part\r\nupwards as a _calyptra_ or hood upon its summit, while the lower part\r\nremains to form a kind of collar round the base. These spore-capsules\r\nare closed on their summit by _opercula_ or lids, and their mouths\r\nwhen laid open are surrounded by a beautiful toothed fringe, termed\r\nthe _peristome_. This fringe is shown in Fig. 303, in the centre of a\r\ncapsule of Funaria, with its peristome _in situ_. The fringes of teeth\r\nare variously constructed, and are of great service in discriminating\r\nthe genera. In _Neckera antipyretica_ the peristome is double, the\r\ninner being composed of teeth united by cross bars, forming a very\r\npretty trellis. The seed spores are contained in the upper part of the\r\ncapsule, where they are clustered round the central pillar, termed the\r\n_columella_; and at the time of maturity, the interior of the capsule\r\nis almost entirely occupied by spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.--Mouth of Capsule of Funaria, showing\r\nPeristome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.--Hair-moss in Fruit.]\r\n\r\nThe undulating hair-moss, _Polytrichum undulatum_ (Fig. 304), is found\r\non moist, shady banks of pools and rivulets. The seed-vessel has a\r\ncurious shaggy cap; but in its construction it is very similar to\r\nthat of the screw-moss, except that the fringe around its opening is\r\nnot twisted. The reproductive organs of mosses are of two kinds; the\r\ncapsule containing minute spores, _archegonia_, and the _antheridia_,\r\nor male efflorescence. The capsule, _theca_, or sporangium, is\r\nlateral or terminal, sessile, or on a fruit stalk (_seta_) of various\r\nshapes, indehiscent, or bursting by four valves at the sides, or more\r\ncommonly by a deciduous cup, _operculum_. When this falls the mouth\r\nof the capsule becomes exposed. The rim is crowned with tooth-like\r\nor cilia-like appendages in sets of four or multiples of that\r\nnumber--_peristome_. These are often brightly coloured and hydroscopic.\r\nBy simply breathing upon them they suddenly fly open, and are endowed\r\nwith motion, that is, if they contain spores. The spores on germination\r\nproduce a green confervoid-like mass of threads, from which the young\r\nplant arises.\r\n\r\nThe Sphagnaceæ, or “bog mosses,” have been separated from true mosses\r\nfrom the marked differences they present. The stem is more widely\r\ndifferentiated, and throughout its structure a rapid passage of\r\nfluid takes place. It has the power of absorbing moisture from the\r\natmosphere, so that if a plant be placed dry in a glass of water with\r\nits rosette of leaves hanging over the edge, it acts like a syphon,\r\nand the water will drop from it until the glass is emptied. As may be\r\nsupposed, the leaf is composed of large open cells, and it absorbs\r\nmore water than the root. The antherids or male organs of Sphagnaceæ\r\nresemble those of liverworts, rather than those of mosses, both in\r\nform and arrangement; they are grouped in “catkins” at the tips of the\r\nlateral branches, each of the imbricated perigonal leaves enclosing\r\na single globose antherid on a slender foot-stalk, and surrounded by\r\nlong branched paraphyses of cobweb-like tenuity. The female organs,\r\nor archegones, do not differ materially in structure from those of\r\nmosses; they are grouped together in a sheath of deep green leaves at\r\nthe end of the shorter lateral branchlets at the side of the rosette\r\nor terminal crown of leaves. The sporange is very uniform in all the\r\nspecies, and the spores are in groups of fours, as in mosses, around a\r\nhemispherical columella. These plants grow so rapidly that they soon\r\ncover a pool with thin matted bundles of branches, and as they decay\r\nthey fall to the bottom, and become the foundation of the future bog or\r\npeat moss.\r\n\r\n=Felices.=--Of all the spore-bearing families the ferns are the more\r\nuniversally known. They constitute an exceedingly numerous genera and\r\nspecies, and vary from low herbaceous plants of an inch in height\r\nto that of tree ferns, which attain a height of fifty or more feet,\r\nterminating in a graceful coronet of fronds or leaves. Of whatever size\r\na fern may be, its spores are, for the most part, microscopic, produced\r\nwithin the sporangium by cell division, and are therefore free and\r\nvariously shaped.\r\n\r\nThe true mode of development of ferns from their spores was that\r\nfurnished by Nägeli, who announced the existence of antheridia. On the\r\nspore starting into life it sends out from the cell-wall of its outer\r\ncoat a white tubular projection, or root fibre (Fig. 305, A, B, and C),\r\nwhich passes through the cell-wall of its outer coat. This attracts\r\nsufficient moisture to burst open the outer, and then it begins to\r\nincrease by the subdivision of its cells, until the primary green\r\nprothallus D is formed. This falls to the ground, and, being furnished\r\non its under side with thread-like fibres, fixes itself to the earth,\r\nand thus is developed the rhizome, or root of the future plant. In each\r\nof the antheridia, which are numerous, a cell is formed, chiefly filled\r\nwith albuminous matter and free spores, each having attached a flat\r\nribbon-like filament, or stermatoid, curled in a spiral manner. These\r\nare ultimately set free by the rupture of the cell-wall, and commence\r\nrevolving rapidly by the agency of the whip-like appendage at the\r\nlarger end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.--Development of the Globular Antheridium and\r\nSpermatoids of _Pteris serrulata_.\r\n\r\nA. Spores; B, C. Early stages of development; D. Prothallus with radial\r\nfibres; _a_, _a_ and _a_, _b_ are stermatoids; and _h_, _h_. Enclosed\r\nantheridia.]\r\n\r\nThe sporangia, or spore-cases, are, for the most part, globular in\r\nform, and are nearly or quite surrounded by a strong elastic ring,\r\nwhich in some cases is continued to form a stalk. When the spores\r\nare ripe, this ring, by its elastic force, tears open the sporangia\r\nand gives exit to a quantity of microscopic filaments, curled in\r\ncorkscrew-like fashion (Figs. 305 and 307). The ring assumes various\r\nforms; in one group it passes vertically up the back of the sporangium,\r\nand is continued to a point termed the stomata, where the horizontal\r\nbursting takes place. This form is seen in Fig. 306, _a_, _b_. In other\r\ngroups it is vertical, as in _c_, _c_; in others transverse, as in _d_;\r\nor apical, as at _e_; and in a few instances it is obsolete, as in _f_.\r\nThese are the true ferns, and their systematic arrangement is chiefly\r\nfounded on the peculiarity of the sori and sporangia, characters which\r\nbecome quite intelligible by the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.--Sporangia of Polypodiaceous Ferns.\r\n\r\n_a_, _b_. Polypodiaceæ; _c._ Cyantheineæ; _d._ Gleichenineæ; _e._\r\nSchizeineæ; _f._ Osmundineæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.--Spores of _Deparia prolifera_.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful ringed sporangium of the fern (Fig. 307) when ruptured\r\ngives exit to the dust-like spores; these, examined under a moderate\r\npower, are seen to be sub-globose and pyramidal, the outer coat or\r\nexospore being a coloured hyaline cell with nuclei similar to the\r\nspores of mosses, but in which chlorophyll soon begins to form, and\r\nfrom this little green embryonic growth the organs of reproduction are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIn all ferns the pistillidia or archegonia are analogous to the ovules\r\nor nascent seeds of flowering plants, and contain, like them, a\r\ngerminal vesicle, which becomes fertilized through the agency of the\r\nspiral filaments, and then gradually develops into an embryo plant\r\npossessing a terminal bud. This bud begins at once to unfold and push\r\nout leaves with a circinate vernation, of a very simple form at first,\r\nand growing up beneath the prothallium, coming out at the notch;\r\nsingle fibrous roots are at the same time sent down into the earth,\r\nthe delicate expanded prothallium withers away, and the foundation of\r\nthe perfect fern plant is laid. When a fern acquires a considerable\r\nstem, as in a tree fern, it consists of cellular tissue and an external\r\ncortical portion forming fibro-vascular bundles, scalariform ducts, and\r\nwoody fibre. Fig. 308, _b_, shows an oblique section of the footstalk\r\nof a fern leaf with its bundle of scalariform ducts.\r\n\r\nThese observations on ferns have acquired increased interest from\r\nsubsequent investigations made on the allied Cryptogams, and on the\r\nprocesses occurring in the impregnation of the Conifers. Not only\r\nhave later researches furnished a satisfactory interpretation of the\r\narchegonia and antheridia of the mosses and liverworts, but they have\r\nmade known and co-ordinated the existence of analogous phenomena in\r\nthe Equisetaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ, and Rhizocarpeæ, and prove, moreover,\r\nthat the bodies described by Dr. Brown in the Conifers under the name\r\nof “corpuscles” are analogous to the _archegonia_ of the Cryptogams;\r\nso that a link is hereby formed between these groups and the higher\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.--_a._ Vertical section of Fern-root, showing\r\nspiral tissue and cells filled with granular bodies; _b._ Section of\r\nFootstalk.]\r\n\r\n_Equisetaceæ._--The development of _Horse-tails_ (Fig. 309), the\r\nname by which they are commonly known, corresponds in some respects\r\nwith that of ferns. They comprise a little group, and the whole of\r\ntheir structure is composed in an extraordinary degree by silex, so\r\nthat even when the organic portion has been destroyed by prolonged\r\nmaceration in strong acid, a consistent skeleton still remains. It\r\nis this flinty material that constitutes their chief interest for\r\nmicroscopists. A portion of their silicious particles is distributed\r\nin two lines, arranged parallel to the axis of the plant, others are\r\ngrouped into oval forms, and connected by a chain as in a necklace. The\r\nform and arrangement of the crystals are better seen under polarised\r\nlight. Plate VIII., No. 170, a portion of the epidermis, forms an\r\nextremely beautiful object. Sir David Brewster pointed out that each\r\nsilicious particle has a regular axis of double refraction. What is\r\nusually said to be the fructification of the Equisetaceæ forms a\r\ncone or spike-like extremity to the top of the stem (Fig. 309), the\r\nwhole resembling a series of spike-like branches (the real stem being\r\na horizontal rhizome), and a cluster of shield-like discs, each of\r\nwhich carries a circle of sporanges that open by longitudinal slits to\r\nset free the spores which are attached to it in two pairs of elastic\r\nfilaments (shown in Fig. 291, F, G), _elaters_; these are at first\r\ncoiled up around the spore in the manner represented at G, but on their\r\nliberation they extend themselves as shown at F. The slightest moisture\r\nwill close them up again, and their purpose having been served in the\r\ndistribution of the spores, they are no longer required. If a number of\r\nspores be spread out on a glass-slip under the microscope and, while\r\nwatching, a bystander breathes upon them, they immediately respond,\r\nare set in motion, presenting a curious appearance, but as soon as\r\nthe hydroscopic effect has passed off they return to their previous\r\ncondition. These spores can be mounted in a cell with a movable cover,\r\nand made to exhibit the same effect over and over again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.--Equisetum giganticum.\r\n\r\n_a._ Fragment of stem showing mode of branching out; _b._ Cone or\r\nspike of fructification; _c._ Scale detached from cone; _d._ Spore\r\nwith elastic filaments; _e._ Vertical section of stem; _f._ Transverse\r\nsection showing hexagonal cells.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vascular tissue of the Equisetaceæ (Fig. 309, _e_, _f_) shows\r\nthem to be of a higher grade than the ferns. More recently discovered\r\nHorse-tails, of Brazil, grow to a gigantic size, but even these are\r\ncomparatively small when compared with the Calamites, and other fossil\r\nEquisetaceæ of the coal measures and new red sandstone. They all\r\nrequire a calcareous flinty soil for growth. A spring water-course\r\nmaking its way to the sea, as in the Chines of the Isle of Wight, is\r\nvery favourable, the author having gathered them more than once in\r\nBramble Chine.\r\n\r\nNearly allied to ferns is a little group of small aquatic plants, the\r\nRhizocarpeæ (pepperworts), which either float on the water or creep\r\nalong shallow bottoms. These are chiefly curious from having two\r\nkinds of spores produced from separate sporanges; smaller and larger\r\n“microspores” undergoing progressive sub-division without the formation\r\nof a distinct prothallium; each cell giving origin to an antherozoid,\r\na generative process said to belong exclusively to flowering plants,\r\ncorresponding indeed to the pollen grains of higher plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nStructure of Phanerogamiæ or Flowering Plants.\r\n\r\nThe two great divisions of the vegetable kingdom are known as\r\nCryptogamia and Phanerogamia. It does not follow, however, that there\r\nis any abrupt break between the two, as will appear from the context.\r\nAlthough it is customary to speak of the flowering plants as a higher\r\ngrade of life, yet there is an intermediary class of Phanerogamiæ in\r\nwhich the conspicuous parts of the generative system partake of a\r\ncondition closely resembling those of the higher Cryptogamiæ, observed\r\nin Gymnosperms, Coniferæ, and Cycadæ. So it may be said the distinctive\r\ncharacter of the former is that of reproduction by seeds rather than\r\nflowers. The progress of botanical science during the latter half of\r\nthe Victorian reign has been quite as remarkable as that of histology;\r\nwhile the comparative physiology and morphology of plants have\r\nperhaps advanced even more rapidly because the ground was newer. The\r\nconsequence is that the specialisation of botanical science has been\r\nbrought about con-currently with a more comprehensive nomenclature.\r\nThe chief cause in this instance of modern specialisation is utility.\r\n“If we look at the great groups of plants from a broad point of view,\r\nit will be seen that the fungi and the phanerogams occupy public\r\nattention on other grounds than do the algæ, mosses and ferns. Algæ are\r\nespecially a physiologist’s group, employed in questions on nutrition,\r\nreproduction, and cell division and growth. The Bryophyta and\r\nPteridophyta, are, on the other hand, the domain of the morphologist\r\nconcerned with such questions as the alternations of generations and\r\nthe evolution of the higher plants.\r\n\r\n“Fungi and phanerogams, while equally or even more employed by\r\nspecialists in morphology and physiology, appeal widely to general\r\ninterest, and evidently so on the ground of utility. Without saying\r\nthat this enhances the importance of either group, it certainly\r\nattracts scientific attention to them. However, the histology of the\r\nminute cell, in addition to its importance from an academical point of\r\nview, has a special interest for the microscopist.”\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to find anything more remarkable in histology\r\nthan the detailed agreement in the structure and behaviour of the\r\nnucleus in the higher plants and the higher animals, an agreement which\r\nis conspicuously manifest in those special divisions which take place\r\nduring the maturation of the sexual cells.\r\n\r\nSo with regard to the question of “alternation of generations.” We\r\nhave known since the important discoveries of Hofmeister that the\r\ndevelopment of a large part of the vegetable kingdom involves a regular\r\nalternation of two distinct generations, the one which is sexual being\r\nconstantly succeeded, so far as the normal cycle is concerned, by the\r\nother which is asexual. This alternation is most marked in the mosses\r\nand ferns. In the Bryophyta the ordinary moss or liverwort plant is the\r\nsexual generation of the ovum, which, when fertilised, gives rise to\r\nthe moss-fruit, and represents the asexual stage. The latter is once\r\nmore seen to form spores from which the sexual plant is again developed.\r\n\r\nIn the Pteridophyta the alternation is equally regular, but the\r\nrelative development of the two generations is totally different,\r\nthe sexual form being the insignificant prothallus, while the whole\r\nfern-plant, as we ordinarily know it, is the asexual generation.\r\n\r\nThe thallus of some of the lower Bryophyta is quite comparable with the\r\nprothallus of a fern, so as regards the sexual generation there is no\r\ndifficulty in seeing the relation of the two classes; but when we come\r\nto the asexual generation or sporophyte the case is totally different.\r\nThere is no appreciable resemblance between the fruit of any of the\r\nBryophyta and the plant of any vascular Cryptogam.\r\n\r\n“It is now known that in the higher plants a remarkable numerical\r\nchange takes place in the constituents of the nucleus of the cell\r\nshortly before fertilisation. In angiospermous plants a reduction of\r\nthe chromosomes occurs shortly before differentiation of the sexual\r\ncells. Thus, in the case of the lily, fertilisation is not the simple\r\nfusion of nuclear bodies. These spheres are seen to fuse in pairs, and\r\nthen by position to determine the plane of first cleavage of the ovum;\r\nagreeing, in fact, closely with what is observed to take place in the\r\nanimal kingdom.”\r\n\r\nIn the higher grades of plants it will be evident that the several\r\ntissues that compose their bodies are not found in the root, stem, and\r\nleaf without definite order and purpose, but that they are grouped\r\ninto systems for the performance of different kinds of work. In all\r\nflowering plants at least three different systems may be clearly\r\ndistinguished. These are the epidermal or boundary tissue system,\r\nthe fundamental or ground tissue system, and the fibro-vascular or\r\nconducting system. All three systems of tissue originate from meristem\r\ncells, located at the growing point of the stem and root.\r\n\r\nAlthough these systems characterise the higher types of plants, the\r\nelementary tissues (represented in Plate XIII. and in other figures)\r\nenter alike into the several component parts of nearly all plants.\r\nThe stem, the branch, and the root, are alike constituted of an outer\r\ncoating which affords a mechanical support, and once formed takes no\r\nfurther share in the economy of the plant, excepting that of assisting\r\nto convey fluid from the roots to the branches and leaves, an action\r\nmore of a capillary nature than vital. The nourishment of the plant is\r\nbrought about by other material structures, as the pith, the cortex,\r\nthe cambium, and so forth, all of which greatly assist in the formative\r\nprocess. The woody portion of the plants is especially concerned in\r\nfurnishing support to the softer pulpy textures, while the tissues\r\nof leaves and flowers are chiefly composed of cells compactly held\r\ntogether by protoplasmic or albuminoid matter. Water, of course, enters\r\nlargely into the constituents of all plants. Beneath the epidermis is\r\nanother layer of importance, the parenchymatous, which becomes more\r\nor less solid with the growth of the pith and cellular wall. In the\r\npulpy substance of some leaves the epidermis presents a thin lamina\r\nof palisade-tissue, the bulk of the mesophyll consisting of spongy\r\nparenchyma or sclerenchymatous fibres (seen in Fig. 310), which also\r\nserve to show the disposition of the several layers about to be brought\r\nunder notice.\r\n\r\n_Development of the Tissue Systems._--In the growing plant the\r\nembryonic cells soon become differentiated into three primary meristem\r\nlayers, known as dermatogen, periblem, and phloem, from which are\r\ndeveloped respectively the primary cortex, epidermis, and the stele or\r\nvascular cylinder. The dermatogen forms the outermost layer of cells at\r\nthe growing point, and when present always develops into true epidermal\r\ntissue. In stems the dermatogen is always single-layered, while in\r\nroots it consists of several layers and develops a many-layered\r\nepidermis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.--Section of Leaf of Piper.\r\n\r\n_c._ Cortex; _ep._ Epidermis; _pal._ Palisade-tissue; _scl f._\r\nSclerenchymatous fibres of pericycle; _o._ Oil gland.]\r\n\r\nThe periblem occurs immediately beneath the dermatogen, forming a\r\nhollow cylinder of tissue, which surrounds the phloem. From the\r\nperiblem is developed the fundamental tissue of the primary cortex.\r\nWhen no dermatogen is present in the growing-point (stems of vascular\r\ncryptogams) the external layer of the periblem develops cells which\r\nperform epidermal functions. The phloem occupies the centre of the\r\ngrowing-point, and consists of a solid mass of somewhat elongated\r\ncells. From the phloem are developed the fibro-vascular and fundamental\r\ntissues of the vascular-cylinder or stele.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY PLANT TISSUES.]\r\n\r\n_Epidermal or Boundary Tissue System._--This system constitutes the\r\nexternal covering of the plant, and is commonly called the epidermis.\r\nIt includes, besides the ordinary epidermal cells, the guard-cells\r\nof the stomata and water pores, the plant hairs or trichomes, and\r\nthe epidermal or external glands. The epidermal tissues are chiefly\r\nprotective in function, serving to prevent excessive evaporation from\r\nthe interior tissues of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.\r\n\r\n_a._ Epidermis, reticulated ducts, and conjunctive palisade cells; _b._\r\nVertical section of alder root, woody layer, and boundary ducts.]\r\n\r\nIn stems the external layer of cells, whatever its origin, is known as\r\nthe epidermis, while in roots it is called the epiblema. The epidermis\r\nusually consists of a single layer of cells, but in some cases it is\r\ntwo or three-layered, as in the leaves of figs and begonias.\r\n\r\nIn land plants the epidermis is usually strongly cutinised, while in\r\nsubmerged plants it is never cutinised. The epidermis of land plants\r\nis also often waxy, the wax occurring on the surface as minute grains,\r\nrods or flakes, constituting the so-called bloom of leaves and fruits,\r\nand giving to them their glaucous appearance. Chlorophyll bodies are\r\nusually absent from the ordinary epidermal cells of land plants, while\r\nthey commonly occur in the epidermal cells of aquatic plants.\r\n\r\nOrdinary epidermal cells are usually thin-walled and transparent, and\r\ncontain a nucleus and colourless watery protoplasm, but are destitute\r\nof both chlorophyll-bodies and starch-grains.\r\n\r\nThe external layers of the outer walls constitute the cuticle of the\r\nplant, while the internal layers and the radial and inner walls are\r\ncomposed of cellulose. The cells of the epidermis are always very\r\ncompactly arranged, having their walls so closely adherent that the\r\nintercellular spaces are entirely obliterated except at the stomata and\r\nwater-pores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.\r\n\r\n1. Vertical section of leaf of _Iris germanica_; _a, a._ Elongated\r\ncells of the epiderm; _b._ Stomata cut through longitudinally; _c,\r\nc._ Green cells of the parenchyma; _d, d._ Colourless tissue of the\r\ninterior of the leaf. 2.

Where this occurs in a plant to any\r\nextent, the whole of the outer tissues are displaced, and the bark\r\nconsists exclusively of phloem tissues. This, although of constant\r\noccurrence in _C. calisaya_, is not so common in other species, as _C.\r\nsuccirubia_, the middle structure of which consists of parenchyma in\r\nwhich appear more or less numerous isolated store-cells, and when these\r\nare absent there is a formation of rhytidoma and displacement of the\r\ntissues containing the store-cells and ducts. The chlorophyll of _C.\r\nsuccirubia_ is very marked, and its spectrum presents seven distinct\r\nabsorption bands.\r\n\r\nThe epidermal system of plants in general includes other tissues\r\nthan those already named, as the guard-cells of the stomata, the\r\nwater-pores, plant-hairs or trichomes, and the external or epidermal\r\nglands, all of which are but modifications of ordinary epidermal tissue.\r\n\r\n_The Stomata or Breathing Pores_ are apertures in the epidermal which\r\nlie over large intercellular spaces (Fig 312, 2, _b_). These are\r\nusually bordered by two modified epidermal cells, called guard-cells.\r\nStomata are formed in the following manner: A young epidermal cell\r\ndivides into two equal portions by the formation of a septum across its\r\nmiddle, each half developing into a guard-cell; the septum now splits\r\nlengthwise and separates the guard-cells, leaving an aperture or stoma\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIn the higher plants the guard-cells of the stomata are crescent-shaped\r\nand occur in pairs, the concave sides of the cells facing each other\r\nwith the aperture between, while in mosses the stomata possesses but a\r\nsingle annular guard-cell which surrounds the aperture. The guard-cells\r\nof stomata usually contain chlorophyll-bodies in addition to the\r\nordinary protoplasm. They have the power of increasing or diminishing\r\nthe size of the aperture under the influence of light and moisture,\r\nthus regulating the amount of evaporation from the internal tissues of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n_Water Pores or Water Stomata_ are apertures in the epidermis, similar\r\nin structure to ordinary stomata, but differ from them both in function\r\nand distribution. Water-pores excrete water in the form of drops, and\r\nhave their guard-cells fixed and immovable. They always occur at the\r\nends of vasal bundles, and are found on the margin and at the apex of\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n_Plant Hairs or Trichomes_ are modified epidermal cells prolonged\r\nexternally, and may be either unicellular or multicellular. Each hair\r\nconsists of a basal portion, or foot, which is embedded among the\r\nordinary epidermal cells, and an apical portion or body, which is\r\nprolonged externally. Ordinary epidermal hairs are usually thin-walled,\r\nthe inner layers of the wall being composed of cellulose, while the\r\nouter layer is more or less strongly cutinised. The walls may become\r\nhardened by deposits of lime-salts or silica. Sometimes the cells\r\nbecome glandular and secrete oily, resinous, or irritating matters, as\r\nin stinging-nettle hairs (Plate XIII., No. 19), when they are known as\r\nglandular hairs. The development of resin-passages may be observed in\r\ntransverse sections of the stem of the ivy (_Hedera helix_) cut from\r\na young succulent stem, and mounted in glycerine. The resin is seen\r\nscattered through the cortex and pith, and in the soft bast which lies\r\noutside the cambium in various stages of development, starting from a\r\ngroup of four cells without intercellular spaces.\r\n\r\nRoot hairs spring from the epiblema and are never cutinised, but are\r\nfrequently more or less mucilaginous. The root-hairs are the principal\r\nabsorbing organs of the plant, and are confined to the younger\r\nroots, occurring just above their tips. Root-hairs are never present\r\nin aquatic plants, and are absent from the roots of certain of the\r\nConiferæ. It is a curious fact with regard to bell-heather growing in\r\nhigher latitudes, that the plants possess a peculiar root structure as\r\na protection against droughts. In most of them the sustentation of life\r\ndepends upon the formation of a number of long thin filaments on their\r\nroots resembling root-hairs, which penetrate the root, forming nodular\r\nmasses within it. These filaments belong to a fungus entirely parasitic\r\nto the root, and yet different from a common parasite, inasmuch as the\r\nplant in this way obtains so much of its nourishment, and when the\r\nfungus is not present, or is removed, the plant can no longer live\r\non a peaty soil. The leaf-blade of the coarse moorland grass Nardus\r\nis likewise endowed with a singular property--that of rolling up\r\ncylindrically and spreading out again to adapt itself to the dry and\r\nwet weather of the moorlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.\r\n\r\n_a._ Section of the testa of Gourd Seed, showing communicating cells\r\nfilled with colouring matter; _b._ Section of stem of Clematis, three\r\npores separated and more highly magnified; _c._ Transverse section of\r\nsame, showing medullary rays.]\r\n\r\n_Fundamental or Ground Tissue System._--This system constitutes the\r\ngroundwork of plants, and is the system through which the vasal bundles\r\nare distributed. The fundamental tissues are composed largely, though\r\nnot wholly, of parenchyma, and are chiefly concerned in the metabolic\r\nwork of plant life.\r\n\r\nGround tissue includes, besides ordinary parenchyma, collenchyma,\r\nselerenchymatous parenchyma, fibrous tissue, cork, laticiferous\r\nand glandular tissues. To the fundamental system also belongs the\r\nchlorophyll cells of leaves, the thin-walled cells of the pith and\r\nmedullary rays, the cells of the cortex of stems and roots, and most of\r\nthe soft cellular tissues in all plants.\r\n\r\nThe lower plants consist almost entirely of fundamental tissue. In\r\nthe herbaceous forms of the higher plants the ground tissues largely\r\npredominate, while in woody plants they are present in much smaller\r\nproportion, the vascular tissues being the most abundant. In aquatic\r\nplants generally, the fundamental tissues constitute the principal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe hypoderma occurs immediately beneath the epidermis, and consists of\r\nseveral layers of cells. A collenchymatous hypoderma is found in the\r\nstems and petioles of most herbaceous dicotyls, and frequently occurs\r\nnext the mid-rib of leaves, where it forms a strengthening tissue. A\r\nsclerenchymatous hypoderma occurs either as a continuous layer beneath\r\nthe epidermis, as in the stems of some ferns, _Pteris aquilina_, and in\r\nleaves of the pine; or it may form numerous isolated strands beneath\r\nthe epidermis, as in the stems of horsetails and in certain Umbelliferæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.\r\n\r\n_a._ Tangential section of _Taxus baccata_ (Yew), showing the woody\r\nfibre; _b._ Vertical section of same, spiral fibres, and ducts; _c._\r\nVertical section of Elm, showing ducts and dotted cells.]\r\n\r\nThe endodermis is the innermost layer of the extra-stelar fundamental\r\ntissues, and always abuts on the stele or steles. In monocotyls it\r\nmarks the boundary between the cortex and the central cylinder, and it\r\nis sometimes spoken of as the nucleus sheath.\r\n\r\nIn stems the endodermal cells are usually thin-walled and unlignified,\r\nhaving a suberous thickening band extending round the upper, lower and\r\nlateral surfaces, which in cross-section appears as a black dot on the\r\nradial wall (Fig. 314, _c_.)\r\n\r\nAccording to its position in the stele, the conjunctive tissue is\r\ndivided into three principal portions, viz., that portion which invests\r\nthe vasal bundles, the pericycle; that portion which lies between the\r\nbundles of the stele, the interfascicular conjunctive tissue; and that\r\nwhich occupies the centre of the stele, the medullary conjunctive\r\ntissue. The pericycle, formerly called the pericambium, is the\r\noutermost layer of the conjunctive tissue of the stele.\r\n\r\nThe bundle-sheath of the young stem is more easily recognised than in\r\nthe older stem. It is, in fact, a continuous layer of cells, whose\r\nradial walls have a characteristic dark spot on each radial wall. The\r\nbundle-sheath lies immediately outside the vascular bundles, curving\r\nslightly towards the centre of the stem in the spaces between the\r\nbundles. It is more prominent in the stem when very young, as the cells\r\nare then filled with starch granules. This layer of cells will be\r\nreadily seen in sections treated with iodine.\r\n\r\nIn dicotyls and gymnosperms the medullary rays consist essentially\r\nof interfascicular ground tissue. The medullary conjunctive tissue\r\noccupies the centre of the stele, constituting the so-called pith, and\r\nusually consists of parenchymatous cells, but may contain, in addition,\r\neither stone cells, sclerenchyma fibres, laticiferous or glandular\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n_The Fibro-vascular or Conducting Tissue System._--This system\r\nconstitutes the fibrous framework of the plant, and is the system by\r\nmeans of which fluids are conducted from one part of the plant to\r\nanother. Its function is partly to give strength and support, but\r\nprincipally to conduct the crude and elaborated juices to and from\r\nthe leaves. It is found only in the higher plants, constituting the\r\ntough and stringy tissues in stems and roots, and the system of veins\r\nin leaves. The fibro-vascular system consists essentially of vascular\r\ntissue (ducts, tracheids, and sieve-tubes), and forms long strands--the\r\nfibro-vascular bundles--which extend vertically through the fundamental\r\ntissues of the plant. The term “fibro-vascular,” as applied to the\r\nconducting system, is not strictly correct, since fibres do not always\r\naccompany the vascular elements, hence this system is often spoken of\r\nas the vascular system, and the bundles as vascular, or more briefly as\r\nvasal bundles.\r\n\r\nThat the arrangement, and course of the vascular bundles in\r\ndicotyledous stems are connected with those of the leaves is an\r\nobvious fact. It may be seen in sections of Helianthus, but is\r\nmore markedly shown in plants with regularly decussate leaves, as\r\nCerastium, Clematis, &c. Still, the arrangement of the bundles may\r\ndiffer radically from that of the leaves, and is, to a certain extent,\r\nindependent of them. This will be noticed in sections of _Iberis\r\namara_, where the bundles do not run longitudinally, but in tangential\r\nspirals. These, as Nägeli pointed out, have no direct relation with\r\nthe leaves; and he recommends a series of types for investigation, in\r\nwhich it will be seen how closely the arrangement of the bundles is\r\nconnected with the arrangement of the leaves, and the number of bundles\r\nentering the stem from each leaf: _Iberis amara_, leaves alternate,\r\nleaf-trace with one bundle; Lupinus, leaves alternate, leaf-trace with\r\nthree bundles; Cerastium, leaves opposite, leaf-trace with one bundle;\r\nClematis, leaves opposite, leaf-trace with three bundles; Stachys,\r\nleaves opposite, leaf-trace with two bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.\r\n\r\n1. Transverse section of the stem of Cedar, showing xylem or wood; 2.\r\nSection of stem of Conifer, the phloem and zones of annual growth; 3.\r\nSection of an Ivory Nut, cells, and radiating pores; 4. Section of the\r\nouter or ligneous portion of same, with radiating cells.]\r\n\r\nThe connection of the leaf and stem will be best seen by cutting\r\nlongitudinal sections through a _young node_ of Helianthus, so as to\r\ninclude the median plane of the leaf, or of both leaves if opposite\r\nto each other, as they often are; steep them in dilute potash for\r\ntwenty-four hours and mount in glycerine. A medium power will serve\r\nfor their examination. The course of the vascular bundles will appear\r\ndark through the more transparent parenchyma. The continuity of the\r\ntissues of the stem and petiole if followed will be seen to have no\r\ndefinite boundary between the two parts; the bundles from the petiole\r\npass into the stem, and no bundle of the upper internode lies in the\r\nsame vertical plane as that which enters from the petiole between two\r\nsuccessive bundles of the vascular ring.\r\n\r\nEvery complete _vasal bundle_ consists of xylem or wood and phloem or\r\nbast.\r\n\r\nThe former consists essentially of trachery tissue (ducts and\r\ntracheids), and may contain in addition both wood fibres and wood\r\nparenchyma. The phloem or bast consists essentially of sieve tissue,\r\nand usually contains some ordinary parenchyma. In angiosperms\r\ncompanion-cells always accompany the sieve-tubes in the phloem, while\r\nin gymnosperms they are absent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the relative positions of the xylem and phloem elements,\r\nthere are two principal kinds of conjoint bundles--the collateral and\r\nthe concentric. Of these again there are three varieties, but the\r\nexperiments with leaves bring out parallel facts; that in ordinary\r\nstems the staining of the wood by an ascending coloured liquid is due,\r\nnot to the passage of the coloured liquid up the substance of the wood,\r\nbut to the permeability of its ducts and such of its pitted cells as\r\nare united into regular canals; and the facts showing this at the same\r\ntime indicate with tolerable clearness the process by which wood is\r\nformed, for what in these cases is seen to take place with dye may be\r\nfairly presumed to take place with sap.\r\n\r\nTaking it, then, as a fact that the vessels and ducts are the channels\r\nthrough which the sap is distributed, the varying permeability of their\r\nwalls, and consequent formation of wood, is due to the exposure of the\r\nplant to intermittent mechanical strains, actual or potential, or both,\r\nin this way. If a trunk, a bough, shoot, or a petiole is bent by a gust\r\nof wind, the substance of its convex side is subject to longitudinal\r\ntension, the substance of its concave side being at the same time\r\ncompressed. This is the primary mechanical effect. The secondary is\r\nwhen the tissues of the convex side are stretched, and also produce\r\nlateral compression. In short, the formation of wood is dependent\r\nupon transverse strains, such as are produced in the aerial parts of\r\nupright plants by the action of the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.--Termination of Vascular System.\r\n\r\n1.--Absorbent organ from the leaf of _Euphorbia neriifolia_. The\r\ncluster of fibrous cells forming one of the terminations of the\r\nvascular system is here embedded in a solid parenchyma.\r\n\r\n2.--A structure of analogous kind from the leaf of _Ficus elastica_.\r\nHere the expanded terminations of the vessels are embedded in the\r\nnetwork parenchyma, the cells of which unite to form envelopes for them.\r\n\r\n3.--End view of an absorbent organ from the root of a turnip. It is\r\ntaken from the outermost layer of vessels. Its funnel-shaped interior\r\nis drawn as it presents itself when looked at from the outside of this\r\nlayer, its narrow end being directed towards the centre of the turnip.\r\n\r\n4.--Shows on a larger scale one of these absorbents from the leaf of\r\n_Panax Lessonii_. In this figure is clearly seen the way in which the\r\ncells of the network parenchyma unite into a closely-fitting case for\r\nthe spiral cells.\r\n\r\n5.--A less-developed absorbent, showing its approximate connection with\r\na duct. In their simplest forms these structures consist of only two\r\nfenestrated cells, with their ends bent round so as to meet. Such types\r\noccur in the central mass of the turnip, where the vascular system is\r\nrelatively imperfect. Besides the comparatively regular forms of these\r\nabsorbents, there are forms composed of amorphous masses of fenestrated\r\ncells. It should be added that both the regular and irregular kinds are\r\nvery variable in their numbers: in some turnips they are abundant, and\r\nin others scarcely to be found. Possibly their presence depends on the\r\nage of the turnip.\r\n\r\n6.--Represents a much more massive absorbent from the same leaf, the\r\nsurrounding tissues being omitted.\r\n\r\n7.--Similarly represents, without its sheath, an absorbent from the\r\nleaf of _Clusia flava_.\r\n\r\n8.--A longitudinal section through the axis of another such organ,\r\nshowing its annuli of reticulated cells when cut through. The cellular\r\ntissue which fills the interior is supposed to be removed.]\r\n\r\nIn concentric bundles one of the elements, either the xylem or the\r\nphloem, occupies the centre, and is more or less surrounded by the\r\nother, as seen in Fig. 310. Meristem tissue is never present, hence\r\nconcentric bundles are always closed. They, however, occur in the stems\r\nof most ferns, and are always surrounded by a pericycle and endodermis,\r\nand should be regarded as steles. Concentric bundles with a central\r\nphloem occur in the rhizomes of some monocotyles, as Calamus, Iris,\r\nConvallaria, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.--Vertical section of Sugar-cane Stem showing\r\nparachyma and crystalline cells, × 200 diameters.]\r\n\r\n_The Stele, or Vascular Cylinder_, is developed from the phloem of\r\nthe growing plant, and consists of one or more vasal bundles imbedded\r\nin fundamental tissue, the whole being enclosed by a pericycle and an\r\nendoderm. The typical _stele_ includes all the tissues evolved by the\r\nendodermis, which, however, forms no part of the vascular cylinder\r\nitself, but merely surrounds it. The pericycle is always the outermost\r\nlayer of the tissues of the stele, while the endodermis is the\r\ninnermost layer of the extra-stelar tissues.\r\n\r\nThe arboreus type of stem can be best followed by making sections\r\nof a twig of the elm (_Ulmus campestris_), which will be found to\r\nbe cylindrical hirsute, green or brown according to age, the latter\r\ncolour being due to the formation of _cork_. Small brown excrescences\r\nare scattered over its surface; these are termed _lenticels_. The cork\r\nwill be seen to lie immediately below the epidermis, and to consist\r\nof cubical cells, with little or no cell contents; they are arranged\r\nin radial rows, without intercellular spaces. The walls of these cork\r\ncells will stain yellowish-brown with Schultze’s solution. Treat a\r\nthin section with sulphuric acid and the walls will swell out and\r\ngradually lose their sharpness of outline, with the exception of the\r\ncuticularised outer wall of the epidermis and the _cork_. This material\r\nis occasionally found developed in the twigs of the elm, so that it can\r\nbe separated as thick radial plates of tissue.\r\n\r\n“By comparing sections of twigs cut of various ages, the following\r\ninformation may be gleaned: That cork cambium, or _phellogen_, appears\r\nas a layer of cortical cells below the epidermis, and that these divide\r\nparallel to the surface of the stem. The result of successive divisions\r\nin this direction is the formation of secondary tissue, which develops\r\nexternally as cork, internally as phelloderm. The true cork cambium\r\nconsists of only a single cell in each radial row, from which, by\r\nsuccessive division, all these secondary tissues are derived--_i.e._,\r\ncambium of vascular bundles. As stems grow older, layers of cork appear\r\nsuccessively further and further from the external surface; not only\r\nthe cortex, but also the outer portions of the phloem are thus cut off\r\nfrom physiological connection with the inner tissue. The term _bark_\r\nis applied to tissues thus cut off, together with the cork which forms\r\nthe physiological boundary. The stem of Vitis affords a good example of\r\nsuch successive layers of cork.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.\r\n\r\n1. Laticiferous Tissue; 2. Vertical section of a Leaf of the\r\nIndia-rubber Tree, with a central gland; 3. Vertical cast of spiral\r\ntubes of Opuntia.]\r\n\r\nFor the study of _sieve-tubes_ take the vegetable marrow, in which they\r\nare of extraordinary size. Cut transverse sections of the stem and\r\nstain with eosin, and mount them in glycerine. The general arrangement\r\nwill be seen to differ from that of most other herbaceous plants.\r\nBelow the epidermis a thick walled band of sclerenchyma with lignified\r\nwalls will be seen distinct from the vascular bundles, which readily\r\ntake a stain. The vascular bundles are separate and distinct, and the\r\nstructure of the bundle is abnormal, there being in each a separate\r\ncentral mass of xylem, with the phloem masses lying, the one central,\r\nthe other in the peripheral side. Between the xylem and the phloem\r\nmasses is the cambium layer. The structure being the same in both will\r\nserve for the study of the punctate sieve-plates; these are readily\r\nstained with eosin, as shown in Sach’s text-book.\r\n\r\n_Laticiferous Tissues_ (Fig. 318).--In cutting sections of latex care\r\nmust be taken to at once transfer them to alcohol so as to prevent the\r\nflow of the latex from the cells, otherwise the laticiferous vessels\r\nwill be much less easily traced. The better method is to plunge the\r\nroot of the dandelion (_Leontodon taraxacum_), after cleaning, into\r\nalcohol, and there let it remain until it has become hardened; then cut\r\nthin tangential sections from the phloem, and longitudinal sections\r\nthrough the cambium, and mount them in potash and glycerine. The\r\nlaticiferous vessels appear circular in the transverse sections with\r\nbrown contents; these are distributed in groups round the central\r\nxylem. Observe in such sections the presence of sphere crystals of\r\ninulin. These are formed quite irrespective of the cell-walls.\r\n\r\nLaticiferous cells are readily seen in the cortex of _Euphorbia\r\nsplendens_, cut just outside the vascular ring. Long tubes will be seen\r\nto run through the cortical parenchyma, with thick cellulose walls and\r\ngranular contents. These are the laticiferous cells, the branching of\r\nwhich distinguishes them from the preceding structure. Included in the\r\ngranular contents are starch grains of a peculiar dumb-bell form.\r\n\r\n_Leaf or Petiole._--The general morphology of leaf tissue is\r\nessentially the same as that of the stem from which it proceeds. In the\r\ntypical monostotic stem of Phanerogamæ each leaf receives a portion\r\nof the stele or central cylinder of the stem. Such portion is termed\r\na meristele, and may be either entire or split up into a number of\r\nschizosteles.\r\n\r\nThe microscopical structure of leaves should be studied in the whole\r\norgan, and by the aid of isolating elements. The whole or portion of a\r\nleaf should be soaked in chloral hydrate solution; this will render it\r\ntransparent, whereby the internal structure can be studied as a whole.\r\nSections should be prepared from fresh leaves, or dried ones softened\r\nby soaking in water. Cut them transversely, both in the direction of\r\nthe mid-rib and at right angles to it. This is best effected by placing\r\nthe material between two pieces of elder pith or fresh carrot. Sections\r\nof the whole are made and transferred to a dish of water. Leaf sections\r\nare easily made for examination by macerating the leaves in solution\r\nof caustic potash varying in strength from one to five per cent. The\r\nepidermis on both sides may be detached, and the elements of the\r\nmesophyll and vascular bundles isolated for separate examination.\r\n\r\nPotassium permanganate proves to be a useful reagent. A weak solution\r\ncauses the protoplasmic structures to swell up, thus assisting in the\r\nobservation of the structure of the chromatophores. This solution may\r\nalso be employed as a macerating fluid. Beautiful preparations are\r\nobtained in this way of the sieve-tubes of Vitis.\r\n\r\nSpecial structural peculiarities are to be observed in the leaves of\r\nvarious plants in which the epidermis consists of more than a single\r\nlayer of cells (_e.g._, the leaves of Ficus, Peperaceæ, Begoniaceæ,\r\n&c.), cystoleths in the cells of the epidermis of Urtica; glandular\r\nstructure in Ruta, Psorales; the coriaceous leaves of the Cherry\r\nLaurel, and the cylindrical leaves of Stonecrop (_Sedum acre_).\r\n\r\n_Reproductive Organs._--The development of the rudiments of flowers is\r\nof an extremely interesting nature, and the complete flower should be\r\ncarefully studied. Median sections are best suited for the purpose.\r\nIn the large majority of plants the calyx is developed first, then\r\nthe corolla, and next the stamens. Preparations should be made from\r\nmaterials hardened in alcohol, or first fixed with a strong solution of\r\npicric acid and then hardened in alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Pollen-grains._--Microspores are found lying free in sections made\r\nof the reproductive organs; these may be transferred to a glycerine\r\nfluid and examined under a high power. They are mostly spherical, with\r\ngranular protoplasmic contents, in which with much difficulty two\r\nnuclei can be made out. Mount and examine, as types of the various\r\nforms of granules, the pollen of Helianthus, Althœa, Cucurbita,\r\nÆnothera, Orchis, Mimosa, Tulipa, &c. Mount any of these pollen-grains\r\nin a weak solution of cane-sugar (about five per cent.), examine with\r\na high power, and note the configuration of their walls with a medium\r\npower under polarised light. If transverse sections be made from very\r\nyoung buds, the development of the anther and the pollen may be traced.\r\nThe material should be preserved in strong alcohol, and the sections\r\ntreated with equal parts of alcohol and glycerine, and exposed in a\r\nwatch-glass that the alcohol may evaporate. By this method sections may\r\nbe prepared for illustrating the formation of the _tapetum_, special\r\nmother-cells, and division of the nucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.--Pollen Grains.\r\n\r\nA. Pollen-grain of Clove-pink; B. Poppy; C. Passion-flower (_Passiflora\r\ncœrulea_); D. _Cobœa scandens_.]\r\n\r\n_Starch Granules._--One of the most universally distributed materials\r\nfound in plants is starch composed of two substances, _granulose_,\r\nwhich constitutes by far the largest part, and a skeleton of\r\n_farinose_. It is only the former of these that stains blue with\r\niodine solutions; the latter partially assumes a brownish colour. The\r\nstructure of starch granules is not of equal density throughout; the\r\nhilum or nuclear portion is most conspicuous, around which the rest\r\nof the material is deposited in layers, indicative of stratification.\r\nThe several layers next to the hilum are less dense than those\r\nfarthest from it. The position of the hilum determines the form of the\r\ngrain, a few being rounded, others oval or elongated. The grain also\r\ncontains different proportions of water; this conveys the appearance\r\nof concentric lines or curves about the nucleus. The latter is more\r\nconspicuous in the potato starches, as seen in Plate XIII., Nos.\r\n6-15. Starch grains, in nearly all cases, are formed by the agency\r\nof proteid bodies, either chloroplasts or amyloplasts, and under the\r\naction of sunlight are gradually broken up and employed in the process\r\nof growth. There are some plants, however, notably the Compositeæ, in\r\nwhich another carbohydrate, _inulin_, takes the place of starch from\r\nthe first, and is used as a reserve food material. For this reason we\r\nlook in vain for starch in the cells of Inula, Taraxacum, &c. From the\r\nwhole group of fungi starch is absent; this seems to explain the fact\r\nthat chlorophyll, or colouring matter, is rarely met with in the fungi,\r\nhence their inability to utilize, like green plants, carbon-dioxide as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.--Swollen Potato Starch, after the application\r\nof potassium hydrate. (Magnified 210 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nThe tissues which most commonly contain starch, or which contain it\r\nin largest quantity, are those of the parenchymatous series, though\r\nit sometimes occurs in the latex of laticiferous tissues, and even in\r\nducts and tracheids. In the stems of Dicotyledons it occurs chiefly\r\nin the parenchyma of the middle and inner bark, in the medullary ray\r\ncells, and in the cells of the pith. In the roots of these plants it\r\nhas a similar distribution, being for the most part confined to the\r\nmiddle or inner bark and the medullary rays, pith not being present in\r\nthese organs. In succulent stems and roots, of course, it also commonly\r\noccurs in the xylem tissues of the fibro-vascular bundles.\r\n\r\nA study of the various kinds of starches is important, since\r\nthis material is very largely used as an adulterant. Other than\r\nmicroscopical means of detecting frauds are practically useless;\r\nassaying is tedious and expensive, while the microscope is always\r\navailable and at hand. The limits of variation should be studied in\r\nstarches from the same species of plants; the variations are not very\r\nwide, but in most cases characteristic, so that the discrimination is\r\nat all times an easy task. The reagents required are simply iodine and\r\ndilute potassium hydrate, aided by polarised light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.\r\n\r\n_a a a._ Granules and cells of cocoa; _b b b._ Arrowroot,\r\n_Tous-les-mois_; _c c c._ Tapioca starch. (Magnified 300 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nThe starch grains of the potato are the best to study in the first\r\ninstance on account of their large size (Fig. 320).\r\n\r\nIn arrowroot starch (Fig. 321) the stratification is almost as distinct\r\nas in that of the potato; the grains much resemble each other. Although\r\nsomewhat smaller, the grains of arrowroot are more uniform in size. The\r\nstarches are much used as an adulterant of drugs and various articles\r\nsold as cocoas.\r\n\r\nWheat-starch (Fig. 322) consists of circular flattened grains varying\r\nmuch in size, the central nucleus and stratification of which are very\r\ndifficult to distinguish.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller starches the hilum becomes more indistinct, and without\r\nstratification, as in rice-starch, the latter being angular in shape.\r\nThe hilum in other leguminous plants forms a longitudinal cleft; white\r\nrye-starch exhibits distinct cracks. Compound grains are occasionally\r\nmet with, as in the oat. In Plate XIII. will be found small groups of\r\nstarches taken under the same medium power for the sake of comparison.\r\nIn the microscopical examination of starches first use a 2/3-inch or a\r\n1/2-inch and then a 1/6-inch objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.\r\n\r\n_a._ Husks of Wheat-starch, swollen by\r\nreagents and heat; _b._ A portion of cellulose; _c._ Rice-starch,\r\nmagnified 420 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe bran of the husk of wheat when broken by grinding is seen to\r\nbe composed of two coats of hexagonal cells, the outer of which\r\nis detached by the roasting process. The hexagonal cell layer is,\r\nhowever, so little altered as to be perfectly distinguishable under the\r\nmicroscope. Thus even a small admixture of roasted corn with coffee\r\nor chicory can be detected without much difficulty. As to whether\r\nstarch granules should be regarded as crystalline or colloid bodies,\r\na difference of opinion still prevails. There are, however, reasons\r\nfor believing that the polarisation effects produced by starch grains\r\nare not due to crystalline structure but to stress or strain, of the\r\nsame nature as the polarisation of glass when it is subject to strain.\r\nThe polarising phenomena are precisely such as would be induced in\r\nany transparent solid composed of layers, the inner of which being\r\nkept in a state of stress by the compression exerted by the outer\r\nlayers. Moreover, when by use of a swelling reagent, such as caustic\r\npotash solution, the outer wall of the starch is made to expand by the\r\nimbibition of water, the polarisation effects immediately disappear.\r\nWere the solid particles of crystal thus forced apart by water each\r\nparticle would still exhibit polarisation phenomena.\r\n\r\nWant of space will not permit me to further enlarge upon other\r\nmicro-chemical substances that enter into the composition of plants;\r\nas, for example, the oil secreting glands. These when present take the\r\nplace of starch. There is, however, one product among the cell contents\r\nof plants of some interest to the microscopist--those extremely\r\nfine crystals known as _raphides_, composed of calcium-phosphate\r\nand oxalate. Mr. Gulliver insisted upon the value of raphides as\r\ncharacteristic of several families of plants. Schleiden states that\r\n“needle-formed crystals, in bundles of from twenty to thirty in a cell,\r\nare present in almost all plants,” and that so really practical is the\r\npresence or absence of raphides, that by studying them he has been able\r\nto pick out pots of seedling Onagraceæ, which had been accidentally\r\nmixed with pots of other seedlings of the same age, and at that period\r\nof growth when no other botanical character would have been so readily\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nIf we examine a portion of the layers of an onion (Plate XIV., No. 3),\r\nor a thin section of the stem or root of the garden rhubarb (No. 4), we\r\nshall find many cells in which either bundles of needle-shaped crystals\r\nor masses of a stellate form occur, not strictly raphides.\r\n\r\nRaphides were first noticed by Malpighi in Opuntia, and subsequently\r\ndescribed by Jurine and Raspail. According to the latter observer,\r\nthe needle-shaped or acicular are composed of phosphate, and the\r\nstellate of oxalate of lime. There are others having lime as a basis,\r\nin combination with tartaric, malic, and citric acids, all of which\r\nare destroyed by acetic acid; others are soluble in many of the fluids\r\nemployed in mounting. These crystals vary in size from the 1/40th\r\nof an inch, while others are as small as the 1/1000th. They occur in\r\nall parts of the plant; in the stem, bark, leaf, petals, fruit, root,\r\nand even in the pollen, and occasionally in the interior of cells. In\r\ncertain species of aloe, as _Aloe verrucosa_, we are able to discern\r\nsmall silky filaments; these are bundles of the acicular form of\r\nraphides, and probably, as in sponges, act as a skeleton support to the\r\ninternal soft pulpy mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nSTELLATE AND CRYSTALLINE TISSUE OF PLANTS.]\r\n\r\nIn portions of the cuticle of the medicinal squill (_Scilla maritima_)\r\nlarge cells are found full of needle-shaped crystals. These cells,\r\nhowever, do not lie in the same plane as the smaller cells of the\r\ncuticle. In the cuticle of an onion every cell is occupied either by an\r\noctahedral or a prismatic crystal of calcium oxalate. In some specimens\r\nthe octahedral form predominates; in others, even from the same plant,\r\nthe crystals are prismatic and arranged in a stellate form, as in that\r\nof the grass (_Pharus cristatus_). (Plate XIV., No. 6.)\r\n\r\nRaphides of peculiar figure are found in the bark of certain trees. In\r\nthe hickory (_Carya alba_) may be observed masses of flattened prisms\r\nhaving both extremities pointed. In vertical sections from the stem of\r\n_Elæagnus angustifolia_, numerous raphides of large size are embedded\r\nin the pith, and also found in the bark of the apple-tree, and in elm\r\nseeds, every cell containing two or more minute crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the Graminaceæ, especially the canes; in the _Equisetum hyemale_,\r\nor Dutch rush; in the husk of rice, wheat, and other grains, silica in\r\nsome form or other is abundant. Some have beautifully-arranged masses\r\nof silica with raphides. The leaves of _Deutzia scabia_, No. 7, are\r\nremarkable for their stellate hairs, developed from the cuticle of both\r\ntheir upper and under surfaces; forming most interesting and attractive\r\nobjects examined under polarised light. (Plate VIII., No. 173.)\r\n\r\nSilica is found in the structure of Rubiaceæ both in the stem and\r\nleaves, and, if present in sufficient thickness, depolarises light.\r\nThis is especially the case in the glandular hairs on the margins of\r\nthe leaves. One of the order Compositæ, a plant popularly known as the\r\n“sneezewort” (_Archillæ ptarmica_), has a large amount of silica in the\r\nhairs found about the serratures of its leaves.\r\n\r\nAll plants are provided with hairs; some few with hairs of a defensive\r\ncharacter. Those in the _Urtica dioica_, commonly called the\r\n_Stinging-nettle_, are glandular hairs, developed from the cuticle, and\r\ncontain an irritating fluid; in other hairs a circulation is visible:\r\nexamined under a power of 100 diameters, they present the appearance\r\nseen at Plate XIII., No. 19.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323.\r\n\r\nA. Cotton; B. Fibres of Flax; C. Filaments of Silk; D. Wool of Sheep.]\r\n\r\nThe fibrous tissue of plants is of great value in many manufactures.\r\nIt supplies material for our linens, cordage, paper, and other\r\nindustries. This tissue is remarkable for toughness of fibre, and\r\nexhibits an approach to indestructibility, in the use it is put to in\r\nconnection with the electric light. It is of importance, then, to be\r\nable to distinguish it from other fibres with which it is often mixed\r\nin various manufactures. Here the use of the microscope is found of\r\nconsiderable importance. In flax and hemp, in which the fibres are\r\nof great length, there are traces of transverse markings at short\r\nintervals. In the rough condition in which flax is imported into\r\nthis country, the fibres have been separated, to a certain extent,\r\nby a process termed _hackling_, and further subjected to hackling,\r\nmaceration, and bleaching, before it can be reduced to the white silky\r\ncondition required by the spinner and weaver, and finally assumes the\r\nappearance of structureless tubes, Fig. 323 B. China-grass, New Zealand\r\nflax, and some other plants produce a similar material, but are not so\r\nstrong, in consequence of the outer membrane containing more _lignine_.\r\nIt is important to the manufacturer that he should be able to determine\r\nthe true character of some of the textures employed in articles of\r\nclothing; this he may do by the aid of the microscope. In linen we find\r\neach component thread made up of the longitudinal, unmarked fibres of\r\nflax; but if cotton has been mixed, we recognise a flattened, more or\r\nless rounded band, as in Fig. 323 A, having a very striking resemblance\r\nto hair, which, in reality, it is; since, in the condition of elongated\r\ncells, it lines the inner surface of the pod. These, again, should\r\nhe contrasted with the filaments of silk, Fig. 323 C, and also of\r\nwool, Fig. 323 D. The latter may be at once recognised by the zigzag\r\ntransverse markings on its fibres. The surface of wool is covered with\r\nfurrowed and twisted fine cross lines, of which there are from 2,000\r\nto 4,000 in an inch. On this structure depends its _felting_ property,\r\nin judging of fleeces, attention should be paid to the fineness and\r\nelasticity of the fibre--the furrowed and scaly surface, as shown by\r\nthe microscope, the quantity of fibre in a given surface, the purity\r\nof the fleece, upon which depend the success of the scouring and\r\nsubsequent operations.\r\n\r\nIn the mummy-cloths of the Egyptians flax only was used, whereas the\r\nPeruvians used cotton alone. By the many improvements introduced into\r\nmanufacturing processes, flax has been reduced to the fineness and\r\ntexture of silk, and even made to resemble other materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324.\r\n\r\n1.

Fossil wood from\r\ncoal.]\r\n\r\n_Fossil Plants._--It is well known that the primordial forests furnish\r\na number of families of plants familiar to the modern algæologist. The\r\ncord-like plant, _Chorda filium_, known as “dead men’s ropes,” from\r\nits proving fatal at times to the too adventurous swimmer who gets\r\nentangled in its thick wreaths, had a Lower Silurian representative,\r\nknown to palæontologists as _Palæochorda_, or ancient chorda, which\r\nexisted, apparently, in two species,--a larger and a smaller. The\r\nstill better known _Chondrus crispus_, the Irish moss, or Carrageen\r\nmoss, has likewise its apparent, though more distant representative,\r\nin chondritis, a Lower Silurian algal, of which there seems to exist\r\nat least three species. The fucoids, or kelpweeds, appear to have also\r\ntheir representatives in such plants as _Fucoides gracilis_, of the\r\nLower Silurians of the Malverns; in short, the Thallogens of the first\r\nages of vegetable life seem to have resembled in the group, and in at\r\nleast their more prominent features, the algæ of the existing time.\r\nAnd with the first indications of land we pass from the thallogens to\r\nthe acrogens--from the seaweeds to the fern-allies. The Lycopodiaceæ,\r\nor club-mosses, bear in the axils of their leaves minute circular\r\ncases, which form the receptacles of their spore-like seeds. And when\r\nhigh in the Upper Silurian system, and just when preparing to quit it\r\nfor the Lower Old Red Sandstone, we detect our earliest terrestrial\r\norganisms, we find that they are composed exclusively of those little\r\nspore-receptacles.\r\n\r\nThe existing plants whence we derive our analogies in dealing with the\r\nvegetation of this early period contribute but little, if at all, to\r\nthe support of animal life. The ferns and their allies remain untouched\r\nby the grazing animals. Our native club-mosses, though once used in\r\nmedicine, are positively deleterious; horsetails (_Equisetaceæ_),\r\nthough harmless, so abound in silex, which wrap them round with a\r\ncuticle of stone, that they are rarely cropped by cattle; while the\r\nthickets of fern which cover our hill and dell, and seem so temptingly\r\nrich and green in their season, scarce support the existence of a\r\nsingle creature, and remain untouched, in stem and leaf, from their\r\nfirst appearance in spring until they droop and wither under the frosts\r\nof early winter.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the coal measures was the richest and most luxuriant,\r\nin at least individual productions, with which the fossil botanist\r\nhas formed an acquaintance. Never before or since did our planet bear\r\nso rank a vegetation as that of which the numerous coal seams and\r\ninflammable shales of the carboniferous period form but a portion of\r\nthe remains--the portion spared, in the first instance, by dissipation\r\nand decay, and in the second by denuding agencies. Nevertheless almost\r\nall our coal--the stored-up fuel of a world--is not, as it is often\r\nsaid to be, the product of destroyed forests of conifers and flora\r\nof the profuse vegetation of the earliest periods in the history of\r\nour globe. Later investigations show that our coal measures are the\r\ncompressed accumulations of peat-bogs which, layer by layer, have\r\nsunken down under the superimposed weight of the next. The vertical\r\nstems of coniferous trees became imbedded by a natural process of\r\ndecay, and were subsequently overwhelmed in the erect position in\r\nwhich they are found. The true grasses scarcely appear in the fossil\r\nstate at all. For the first time, amid the remains of a flora that\r\nseems to have had but few flowers--the Oolitic ages--do we detect, in\r\na few broken fragments of the wings of butterflies, decided traces\r\nof the flower-sucking insects. Not, however, until we enter into the\r\ngreat Tertiary division do these become numerous. The first bee makes\r\nits appearance in the amber of the Eocene, locked up hermetically\r\nin its gem-like tomb--an embalmed corpse in a crystal coffin--along\r\nwith fragments of flower-bearing herbs and trees. Her tomb remains\r\nto testify to the gradual fitting up of our earth as a place of\r\nhabitation for creatures destined to seek delight for the mind and\r\neye, as certainly as for the proper senses, and in especial marks\r\nthe introduction of the stately forest trees, and the arrival of the\r\ncharmingly beautiful flowers that now deck the earth.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-kingdom Protozoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the whole special group of organisms forming the\r\nsubject matter of this chapter, under the heading of Protozoa, were\r\nformerly included among Infusoria, which also embraced every kind\r\nof microscopical aquatic body, whether belonging to the vegetable\r\nor animal series. A more critical survey of the organisation and\r\naffinities of Infusoria and the members which constituted the group\r\nled to a re-arrangement, which has been very generally accepted as\r\nforming a sub-kingdom, Protozoa. This may be defined as embracing\r\nall those forms of life, referable to the lowest grade of the animal\r\nkingdom, whose members for the most part are represented by organisms\r\npossessing a single cell or aggregation of cells (and also included\r\nunder the general term of unicellular organisms) the whole of which are\r\nengaged in feeding, moving, respiring, and reproducing by segmentation\r\nor fission much in the same way as that of the unicellular plants\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter. Following out this sub-division of the\r\nentire series of Protozoa, the several groups range themselves into\r\nfour readily distinguishable sections. In the first, the most lowly\r\norganised and most abundant have no oral orifice in the literal meaning\r\nof the word, food being intercepted at any point of the surface of the\r\nbody. This most simple elementary type of structure of the Protozoa is\r\nrepresented in the Amœba and Actinophrys, the various representatives\r\nof the Foraminifera, and certain Flagellata, as Spumella and\r\nAnthrophysa. Next in the ascending scale is a group of Protozoa, in\r\nwhich, though differentiation has not proceeded so far as to arrive\r\nat the constitution of a distinct oral aperture, the inception of\r\nfood substance is limited to a discoidal area occupying the anterior\r\nextremity of the body and is associated with the special food-arresting\r\napparatus. To this section of the Protozoa are relegated the minuter\r\nflagellate, “collar-bearing” animals, and also the entire group of\r\nsponges or Porifera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREGARINIDA, POLYCYSTINA, FORAMINIFERA, ROTIFERA, ETC.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE III.]\r\n\r\nIn the third section the highest degree of organisation is arrived\r\nat. Here is represented a single, simple, often highly-differentiated\r\noral aperture or true mouth. Associated with this section are found\r\nthe majority of those organisms that collectively constitute the class\r\nInfusoria in the proper acceptation of the term, and it embraces the\r\nmajority of the Ciliata, the Cilio-flagellata, as Euglena, Chilomonas,\r\n&c., in which the presence of a distinct and circumscribed oral\r\naperture is clearly seen. With the fourth and remaining section\r\nof Protozoa, the oral or inceptive apparatus exhibits a highly\r\ncharacteristic structural modification. This is not restricted to\r\na definite area, nor is it associated with the entire surface of\r\nthe body, but it consists of a number of flexible, retractile,\r\ntentacle-like organs radiating from diverse and definite regions of\r\nthe periphery, each of which subserves as a tubular sucking-mouth, or\r\nfor the purpose of grasping food. These may be literally described as\r\nmany-mouthed, and have been appropriately designated Polystomata. The\r\ntrue zoological position of the Spongida or Porifera is not finally\r\nsettled, the members of this important section having been formerly\r\nregarded as a subordinate group of the Rhizopoda or an independent\r\nclass of the Protozoa; consequently a tendency has been shown to\r\nassign to them a position more nearly approximating to that of the\r\nCœlenterata, or zoophytes and corals, or place them among the more\r\nhighly organised tissue-constructed animals, the Metazoa, these being\r\ncharacterised by groups of cells set apart to perform certain functions\r\nfor the whole animal. A division of labour is seen to be marked in\r\nthese lower animals as the organism becomes more specialised, and the\r\nnumber of functions a cell performs becomes more and more limited as\r\nthe body becomes more complex.\r\n\r\nIt has been found convenient to adopt the following definition of the\r\nInfusoria as one more generally acceptable. The Protozoa in their adult\r\ncondition are furnished with prehensile or locomotive organs, that take\r\nthe form of cilia, flagella, or of adhesive or suctorial tentacula, but\r\nnot of simple pseudopodia; their zooids are essentially unicellular,\r\nfree swimming or sedentary; they are either naked, loricate, or inhabit\r\na simple, mucilaginous matrix; single or united in aggregations, in\r\nwhich the individual units are distinctly recognisable; not united and\r\nforming a single gelatinous plasmodium, as in Mycetozoa, nor immersed\r\nwithin and lining the interior cavities of a complex protoplasmic\r\nand mostly spiculiferous skeleton, as in the Spongida, their food\r\nsubstances being intercepted by a single distinct oral aperture, or\r\nby several apertures through a limited terminal region or through the\r\nentire area of the general surface of the body. They increase by simple\r\nlongitudinal or transverse fission, by external or internal gemmation\r\nor division, preceded mostly by a quiescent or encysted state, into\r\na greater or less number of sporular bodies. Sexual elements, as\r\nrepresented by true ova or spermatozoa, are entirely absent, but two\r\nor more zooids frequently coalesce as an antecedent process to the\r\nphenomena of open formation.[63]\r\n\r\nThe infusorial body in its simplest type of development, as in\r\nAmœba, exhibits a structural composition substantially corresponding\r\nwith that of the lowest organised tissue cell. There is no distinct\r\nbounding membrane, or cell-wall, and it is throughout, and apart from\r\nthe nucleus or endopart, one continuous mass of granular matter, but\r\notherwise homogeneous and undifferentiated protoplasm. Professor\r\nGreef, who has made a study of the Amœba, describes motor fibrils in\r\nthe exoplasm which are active and large in _A. terricola_. These are\r\nreadily seen by staining with osmic acid, and, after washing this\r\nout with water, immersing in a weak alcoholic solution. In Amœba so\r\nprepared and examined with a high power, the whole body will be seen\r\nto be surrounded by a distinct double integumentary layer. Highly\r\nrefractive bodies may also be seen in the interior, connected together\r\nby extremely fine filaments. Professor Greef concludes that here we\r\nhave to do with muscular fibrillæ, which traverse the contractile outer\r\nzone in a radial direction and there terminate for the time being. By a\r\nsimilar method, axial filaments can be demonstrated in Heliozoa; these,\r\nit is believed, are the true motors of their pseudopodia, and also the\r\naxial structures of the Acineta, a marine animal related to ciliate\r\ninfusoria.\r\n\r\nIn the Amœba, at one time well known as the _Proteus animalcule_,\r\nFig. 325, the marvellous body creeps onward in a flowing manner,\r\noccasionally and languidly emitting a single pseudopod first on one\r\nside, then on the other. More commonly it puts on a dendroid or palmate\r\nform; then again it assumes more or less grotesque shapes in which\r\nalmost any conceivable image may be imagined. The body, as will be\r\nseen in this highly-magnified figure, is full of granules (with the\r\nexception of a thin clear outer hyaline zone), and near the centre is\r\na globular or discoid body known as the nucleus, composed of slightly\r\ndenser material than that which surrounds it. The division of the body\r\ninto two is preceded by a division of this nucleus. Near the latter\r\nis a clear spherical space--the contractile vacuole--which gradually\r\nexpands, and then rather suddenly collapses and reappears at the\r\nsame spot, the systole and diastole being slow and continuous. The\r\ncontractile vacuole contains a clear liquid which is expelled on the\r\ncollapse of the vacuole. This organ probably serves the double function\r\nof respiration and excretion. The Amœba is omnivorous, chiefly a\r\nvegetarian, and, therefore, found on the ooze of ponds or on the under\r\nsurface of the leaves of aquatic plants, especially among Confervæ. It\r\ncan be readily produced by placing a few fibres of fresh meat in an\r\ninfusion of hay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325.--Amœba, _Proteus animalcule_; magnified 600\r\ndiameters.--(Warne).]\r\n\r\nThe Gregarinæ consist of a remarkable group of organisms, but these,\r\nalthough unicellular, are, for the most part, confined to the\r\nintestinal tract of worms and of the higher animals, and will therefore\r\nbe described among internal parasites.\r\n\r\nTho fungus-animals, Mycetozoa, have already been referred to in a\r\nprevious chapter. The best known species, however, is found in tan\r\nyards in the form of creeping masses of naked protoplasm, termed\r\nPlasmodia. Cakes of protoplasm become segregated from the main mass,\r\nand break up into Amœba-like spores, which unite again to form\r\nPlasmodia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326.--Rhizopoda lobosa.\r\n\r\nA. _Difflugia proteiformis_; B. _Difflugia oblonga_; C, D. _Arcella\r\nacuminata_ and _dentata_]\r\n\r\nThe Rhizopoda, or root-footed class of animals, are among the most\r\ninteresting simple organisms with which the microscope has made us\r\nacquainted. In the living state they have the power of protruding\r\npseudopodia from the body, by which they creep about, or cling to\r\nplants when in search of food. This group, in fact, includes Amœba,\r\nForaminifera, Sun-animalcules, and Radiolarians. In the first the\r\npseudopodia are simple and lobose; in the second they are slender,\r\nconfluent and reticulate; while in the two last they are simple,\r\nradiating and somewhat stiff, and partake of a calcareous formation.\r\n\r\nOf the Lobosa, we may take a well-known representative of the group,\r\nthe Protomyxa, found at the bottom of fresh-water pools, especially\r\nthose near bog-moss, where its minute orange-coloured particles of\r\njelly-like substance are seen creeping over stones or shells. If\r\nquietly watched the pseudopodia, some of which are broad and others\r\nslender, become quiescent spheres, which break up into numerous\r\nportions, each of which becomes a new animal.\r\n\r\nThis group is divided into the shell-less (Nuda) and shell-formed\r\n(Testacea). The brown, horny covering is often finely faceted, and is\r\neither shaped like a dome, semi-circular, or flat as a box, through\r\nwhich they protrude their few or many pseudopodia (seen in Fig. 326).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nGROMIA.]\r\n\r\nIn the Difflugia the lorica or shell is strengthened by the addition of\r\nsilicious particles; in Euglypta it is sac-shaped, with a jagged free\r\nmargin, the surface being covered by overlapping scales; while Arcella\r\nare capable of secreting vesicles of air in their interior, whereby\r\nthey are enabled to rise to the surface. On some parts of our coast, if\r\nthe sea sand be carefully looked over with a pocket lens, there will\r\noften be found minute grains of a porcelain oval kind, belonging to the\r\nMiliolina, segmented or strung together not quite in the same plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327.--Section of Rotalia.\r\n\r\n_a,a_, Radiating interceptal canals; _b_, Internal bifurcations; _c_,\r\nTransverse branch; _d_, Tubular wall of chambers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 328.--_Rosalina varians_ or _Discorbina globularia_, with\r\npseudopodia protruding.]\r\n\r\nThe Foraminifera are rhizopods, whose simple protoplasmic bodies\r\nsend forth, through perforations in the membrane or outer covering\r\nof calcium carbonate and silica, branching rays of pseudopodia. The\r\norder is divided into two groups, the Imperforata and the Perforata;\r\nin the former the shell or harder structure possesses only one or more\r\napertures, whereas in the latter, in addition to the main opening,\r\nthe shell has its walls perforated throughout, which admits of minute\r\npseudopodia or fine threads being protruded (Fig. 328). (See also Plate\r\nIII., Nos. 75-85.) The vast majority of Perforata form their shells, or\r\nrather skeletons, of calcium carbonate and silica, which renders them\r\nalmost indestructible. Consequently the form is preserved through ages,\r\nand they present objects of the greatest interest to the microscopist.\r\n\r\nA curious and interesting feature of the Foraminifera--often an element\r\nof difficulty to the student--is the tendency of modifications of types\r\ncomprising the larger groups to run into parallel isomorphous series.\r\nThus, if the entire class be roughly divided, as it sometimes has been,\r\ninto three orders, comprising respectively the forms characterised\r\nby porcellaneous, arenaceous, and hyaline “tests,” the same general\r\nconformation and arrangement of chambers will be found in each of the\r\nthree series. The most remarkable example, even among the smaller\r\ngroups, is the Rotaliidæ, of which three or four genera may be arranged\r\nin parallel lines, and in more or less closely isomorphous series.\r\nIn the report appended to the “Challenger” scheme of classification\r\nmany examples are enumerated. In Arenacea we have a small family of\r\nForaminifera, the external surfaces of which present a ridge and furrow\r\narrangement, and the incrustations are entirely of a sandy nature\r\nheld together by a cement secreted by the animal. (Plate XV., No. 1,\r\n_Astrorhiza limicola_.)\r\n\r\n_Gromia._--Among the more remarkable of the Perforata group the Gromia\r\nhave a foremost place. They are very minute globular or oval-shaped\r\nbodies, about one-twenty-fourth of an inch in length, found in fresh,\r\nbrackish, and salt water. The forms brought up in Dr. Wallich’s deep\r\nsea soundings of 1860 were taken attached to pieces of corallines,\r\nor found loose among Globigerina ooze. At first there appears to be\r\nnothing peculiar about these tiny specks of matter resembling the ova\r\nof a zoophyte, but presently, at the smaller end, a very fine thread\r\nis protruded, and then another, dividing into finer branches, and,\r\nultimately, a complete network of filaments extends on all sides, and\r\nbecome attached to the side of the glass jar that contains them. Now,\r\non employing magnifying power, every thread exhibits a circulatory\r\nmotion, an up and down stream or cyclosis of granules suspended in a\r\nfluid mass. It is by means of these pseudopodia, as the threads are\r\ntermed, that the Gromia moves its body along and clings to the glass.\r\nWe may surmise, then, that these pseudopodia are either gelatinous,\r\nglutinous, or terminate in sucker-like processes. Increase in the\r\n“test,” integument, is brought about, as in Difflugia, by the secretion\r\nof calcareous matter or by cementing fine silicious particles to the\r\nouter wall, as the protoplasm is seen to flow over the test, so that\r\nwhen it comes in contact with a diatom it is thereby drawn towards the\r\noral opening and slowly digested.\r\n\r\nSome considerable time elapsed between the discovery of Gromia by Mr.\r\nW. Archer, F.R.S., and the demonstration of a nucleus and contractile\r\nvesicle by Dr. Wallich. It was thought that in the whole of the Monozoa\r\nthe nucleus was absent, but it is now known that this important body is\r\nembedded in the protoplasmic substance, and the reproduction of these\r\ncurious animals is thereby secured. Among the better known species of\r\nGromia is _G. Dujardinii_, chiefly distinguishable by the darker colour\r\nof the “test,” by the greater quantity of silica that enters into\r\nthe formation of its pseudopodia, and by the formation of isogamous\r\nzoospores, two of which are seen in conjugation in Plate XV., No. 2.\r\nAn excess of protoplasm must also be secreted to admit of so large a\r\nprotrusion outside the testa.\r\n\r\n_G. Lieberkühnia_ (of Claparède and Lachman), No. 5, differs in\r\nformation. Its shape is pyriform, and the opening whence the\r\npseudopodia streams out is situated in a lateral depression about\r\nmidway in the testa, _c, o_. Hence a trunk branch is seen to issue\r\nforth, and from this a ramification of threads, _psdp_, extends to a\r\nconsiderable distance in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe Micro-gromia of Hertwig, No. 4, is the minutest form of the genus\r\nyet discovered, and differs from those already described in the mode\r\nof reproduction. The individual takes the shape of a water bottle with\r\na short neck, whence issue forth a limited number of very slender\r\nthreads. The test is quite transparent, and it was in this species that\r\nthe nucleus and contractile vesicle, which lie embedded near the mouth,\r\nwere first clearly made out.\r\n\r\nThe zoospores of Micro-gromia have a curious habit of uniting with\r\ntheir neighbours to form a colony, No. 4. Their colonisation is\r\napparently intended to facilitate multiplication. Reproduction is\r\ncarried on somewhat after the manner of Volvox. The globular bodies\r\nformed sink to the bottom of the glass vessel, and there remain for\r\na time in a quiescent state. In the course of a day or two the mass\r\nassumes a motive appearance, increases in bulk, becomes more ovoid in\r\nshape, and ultimately the nucleus shows the first sign of division.\r\nVertical segmentation takes place, as at A, into two equal parts; each\r\nhalf is seen to possess its fair share of the nucleus and contractile\r\nvesicle. It then turns in the horizontal direction, and now there\r\nappears to be an upper and a lower division, the uppermost having a\r\nneck-like attachment, and this is making its way to the narrow oral\r\nopening in the parent testa, as at B. Here it is seen pressing forward,\r\nand at C the neck is protruding some distance, and the second half\r\nassumes a bottle shape; at D the greater part of the animal is nearly\r\nset free, and after a short rest it fully launches forth. It finally\r\npulls itself together, as at E, and either develops a pair of flagella\r\nand swims off, or assumes the form of an Actinophrys. In either case,\r\nand in a very short space of time, the separated young animal is quite\r\nready to re-unite, as at F, and assist in forming a new colony of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe Polymorphina belong to a low genus of the Foraminifera. They\r\nconsist of a number of forms and exhibit a rather extensive series of\r\nvariations, although consisting of a few simple types, and showing\r\ntransitions between forms which at first seem to be distinct. The\r\nmajority of species keep to the sea bottom; some few are pelagic,\r\nand occur in abundance on the surface of the ocean. Among the latter\r\nare the Globigerina: its shell is about one-fortieth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and usually composed of seven globular chambers arranged\r\nspirally in such a manner that all are visible from above, each chamber\r\nopening by a crescentic-shaped orifice into a depression in the middle\r\nof the next. Perfect specimens bristle with long slender spines, the\r\npores affording passage to pseudopodia, which stream out along the\r\nspines. The more carefully-conducted deep-sea investigations have\r\nbrought to light the fact that the floor of the ocean, at great depths,\r\nand over a vast area, is formed of these white or pinkish coloured\r\nbodies, all containing on an average about 60 per cent. of calcium\r\ncarbonate. It is a question whether the Globigerinidæ which make up the\r\nbulk of the ooze actually live at the bottom as well as the surface of\r\nthe sea. This question has given rise to much discussion. Dr. Murray\r\ncame to the conclusion that pelagic species do not live near the ocean\r\nfloor. This opinion is partly based on the fact that the area of the\r\nGlobigerina ooze coincides with the area of surface of temperature at\r\nwhich these bodies are found to exist. When the surface water is too\r\ncold for them, they are not to be found, neither are they found below.\r\nMajor S. R. J. Owen, while dredging the surface of mid-ocean--the\r\nIndian, and the warmer portion of the Atlantic--found attached to his\r\nnets a number of these interesting bodies, and which always made their\r\nappearance just about sunset. In Plate III., Nos. 43-52, a number of\r\nthese interesting and variously-formed bodies are given, and an attempt\r\nis also made to show the richly-tinted colour appearances presented by\r\nthe sarcode or protoplasm of the Globigerina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329.--Globigerina and other bodies taken in deep\r\nsea soundings (Atlantic).]\r\n\r\n“Many of the forms,” writes Major Owen,[64] “have hitherto been claimed\r\nby the geologist, but I have found them enjoying life in this their\r\ntrue home, the silicious shells filled with coloured sarcode, and\r\nsometimes this sarcode in a state of distension somewhat similar to\r\nthat found projecting from the Foraminifera, but not in such slender\r\nthreads. There are no objects in nature more brilliant in their\r\ncolouring or more exquisitely delicate in their forms and structure.\r\nSome are of but one colour, crimson, yellow, or blue; sometimes two\r\ncolours are found on the same individual, but always separate, and\r\nrarely if ever mixed to form green or purple. In a globular species,\r\nwhose shell is made up of the most delicate fretwork, the brilliant\r\ncolours of the sarcode shine through the little perforations very\r\nprettily. In specimens of the triangular and square forms (Plate III.,\r\nNos. 43, 44, 45 and 46), the respective tints of yellow and crimson\r\nare vivid and delicately shaded; in one the pink lines are concentric;\r\nwhile another is of a stellate form, the points and uncoloured parts\r\nbeing bright clear crystal, while a beautiful crimson ring surrounds\r\nthe central portion. A globular form resembles a specimen of the\r\nChinese ball-cutting--one sphere within another; this, however, appears\r\nto belong to a distinct species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330.--Globigerina and other bodies taken in deep\r\nsea soundings, 1856 (Atlantic).]\r\n\r\n“The shells of some of the globular forms of these Polycystina,\r\nwhose conjugation I believe I have witnessed, are composed of a fine\r\nfretwork, with one or more large circular holes; and I suspect the\r\njunction to take place by the union of two such apertures. That the\r\nfigures of these shells become elongated, lose their globular form\r\nafter death, and present a disturbed surface is seen in some of the\r\nfigures represented in Plate III., Nos. 82-85.” Those without internal\r\nchambers have been described as _Orbulina universa_, Plate III., Fig.\r\n78, while Nos. 75 and 76, although members of the same family, have\r\nbeen separated, but all should certainly be united under Globigerina.\r\n\r\n“The minute silicious shells of Polycystina present wonderful beauty\r\nand variety of form; all are more or less perforated, and often\r\nprolonged into spines or other projections, through which the sarcode\r\nbody extends itself into pseudopodial prolongations resembling those\r\nof Actinophrys. When seen disporting themselves in all their living\r\nsplendour, their brilliancy of colouring renders them objects of\r\nunusual attraction. It will appear that they wish to avoid the light,\r\nas they are rarely found on the surface of the sea in the daytime;\r\nit is after sunset and during the twilight that they make their\r\nappearance.”\r\n\r\nMany forms of Globigerina and Foraminifera are represented in Figs.\r\n329 and 330. These varied and beautiful forms were dredged up with\r\nsoundings made in 1856 for the purpose of ascertaining the depth of the\r\nAtlantic, prior to the laying down of the electric telegraph wire from\r\nEngland to America, and taken at a depth of 2,070 fathoms.\r\n\r\n_Heliozoa._--_Actinophrys-Sol_, “sun-animalcules,” belong to this\r\ngroup; most of them inhabit fresh water (Plate III., No. 66). The\r\nchief characteristic, and the one to which they owe their name, is\r\nthe possession of long, slender, somewhat stiff pseudopodia; these\r\nradiate from all parts of the body. The living animal usually contains\r\ngreen-coloured particles within a minute translucent spherical globule\r\nof about 1/250th of an inch in diameter. It is, therefore, variously\r\ndesignated the green sun-animalcule, Acanthocystis, or Actinophrys-Sol.\r\nIt is commonly found amongst the weeds in clear pools of water, where\r\ndesmids abound. The pseudopodia appear to be stiff; they are, however,\r\nquite flexible, and the body contains more than one clear vesicle with\r\na nucleus; reproduction is secured by the simple division commencing\r\nin the nucleus. The little animal can move over a hard surface by\r\nthe alternate relaxation and stiffening of its pseudopodia; when one\r\nof these touches a small organism, it is believed to paralyse it,\r\nthen envelop, and deliberately digest it. In another species, the\r\nlattice-animalcule (Cathrulina), the pseudopodia or silicious threads\r\nare arranged tangentially. It grows on a long flexible stalk, attached\r\nto an aquatic plant, the total length of which is about 1/200th an\r\ninch. The globular body is perforated in all directions, through which\r\nthe fine stiff pseudopodia are thrust out; it is often known to form\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIn this order may well be placed the Radiolaria; they are, however,\r\nusually separated. But Radiolarians, whether seen alive or in their\r\nskeleton form, are surpassingly beautiful. By the favour of Messrs.\r\nWarne, I am enabled to append a frontispiece plate to this volume taken\r\nfrom their “Royal Natural History.” These bodies are all marine, and\r\nlive in zones of several thousand fathoms, and like their congeners,\r\nthe Globigerina, they avoid a strong light, and only appear after\r\nsunset. Their bodies are supposed to emit a phosphorescent glow, but\r\nmore is known of their silicious skeletons than of their living forms;\r\nyet it is not this feature that separates them from other orders of\r\nrhizopods, but the possession of a membranous central capsule enclosing\r\nthe nucleus. The body substance outside this capsule is highly\r\nvacuolated in some species, especially in surface forms. A few are\r\nwithout a skeleton, and these consist of oval masses of protoplasm,\r\nwith slender pseudopodia. In a few species the skeleton is formed of\r\na glassy horny substance, termed acanthin, arranged in the form of\r\nradiating spines.\r\n\r\nRadiolarians secrete a silicious skeleton, which assumes a variety of\r\nforms, as trellis-work, boxes joined by radiating spines, helmets,\r\nbaskets, bee-hives, discs, rings, and numerous other forms. Haeckel\r\nhas described upwards of four thousand species, and possibly as many\r\nmore could be added to this number. Radiolaria are divided into two\r\ngroups. In the one there is either no skeleton or one of silex; in the\r\nother the skeleton is formed of radiating spines of a horny nature.\r\nThese are again subdivided according to the characters of the central\r\ncapsule. In those forms with a silicious skeleton the geometrical\r\npattern conforms more or less to the shape of the central capsule,\r\nbeing either spherical or conical. The central capsule is regarded as\r\nbeing homologous with the calcareous shell of Globigerina. Reproduction\r\ntakes place by simple division into two, or by the body breaking up\r\ninto spores, each provided with a flagellum, or two spores may fuse\r\ntogether, and the result will be an adult Radiolarian. Certain yellow\r\ncorpuscles present in the outer part of their body-surface change into\r\nunicellular parasitic algals; these can be separated and cultivated\r\nindependently of their host. The Radiolarians live floating at all\r\ndepths from 1,000 to 2,500 fathoms, and are distributed over areas in\r\nthe central Pacific and the south-eastern part of the Indian Ocean,\r\nthe ooze forming the ocean bed being made up of their skeletons to\r\nan extent of 80 per cent. of the deposit; hence it has become known\r\nas Radiolarian ooze. The chalky-looking Barbadoes earth, a Tertiary\r\nformation, is composed almost entirely of their skeletons. Somewhat\r\nsimilar deposits exist in the Nicobar Islands, in Greece, and in Sicily.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that by far the greater number of\r\nForaminifera are of marine origin, and these occur in such widespread\r\nprofusion that the finest calcareous particles which constitute the\r\nseashore in some places consist almost wholly of their microscopic\r\nremains. At former periods of the earth’s history they appear to have\r\nexisted even in greater profusion than at the present time. This is\r\nevidenced by their remains forming the principal constituent of our\r\nlargest geological formations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, during the Canadian Geological Survey large masses of what\r\nappeared to be a fossil organism were discovered in rocks situated\r\nnear the base of the Laurentian series of North America. Sir William\r\nDawson, of Montreal, referred these remains to an animal of the\r\nforaminiferal type; and specimens were sent by Sir W. Logan to the late\r\nDr. Carpenter, requesting him to subject them to a careful examination.\r\nAs far back as 1858 Sir W. Logan had suspected the existence of organic\r\nremains in specimens from the Grand Calumet limestone, on the Ottawa\r\nRiver, but a casual examination of the specimens was insufficient to\r\ndetermine the point. Similar forms being seen by Sir W. Logan in blocks\r\nfrom the Grenville bed of the Laurentian limestone were in their turn\r\ntried, and ultimately revealed their true structure to Sir William\r\nDawson and Dr. Sterry Hunt, who named the structure _Eozoon Canadense_.\r\n\r\nThe masses of which these fossils consist are composed of layers of\r\nserpentine alternating with calc spar. It was found by these observers\r\nthat the calcareous layers represented the original shell, and the\r\nsilicious layers the softer parts of the once living Foraminifera.\r\nThe results were arrived at through comparison of the appearance\r\npresented by the Eozoon with the microscopic structure which Dr.\r\nCarpenter had previously shown to characterise certain members of the\r\nForaminifera. The Eozoon not only exceeded other known Foraminifera\r\nin size to an extent that might have easily led observers astray,\r\nbut, from its apparently very irregular mode of growth and general\r\nexternal form, no help was derived in its identification, and it was\r\nonly by microscopical examination of its minute structure that its true\r\ncharacter was ascertained. Dr. Carpenter wrote:--“The minute structure\r\nof Eozoon may be determined by the microscopic examination either of\r\nthin transparent sections, or of portions which have been subjected to\r\nthe action of dilute acids, so as to remove the calcareous portion,\r\nleaving only the internal casts, or models, in silex, of the chambers\r\nand other cavities originally occupied by the substance of one animal.”\r\nSubsequently he found portions of minute structure so perfect that he\r\nwas able to say that “delicate pseudopodial threads were originally\r\nput forth through openings in the shell wall of less than 1/10000th of\r\nan inch in diameter” (Plate III., Nos. 64, 65). In a paper read at the\r\nmeeting of the Geological Society he stated that he had since detected\r\nEozoon in a specimen of ophicalcite from Bohemia, in a specimen of\r\ngneiss from near Moldau, and in specimens of serpentine limestone sent\r\nto Sir C. Lyell by Dr. Gümbel, of Bavaria. These also were found to be\r\nparts of the great formation of the “fundamental” gneiss, considered\r\nby Sir Roderick Murchison as the equivalent of the Laurentian rocks of\r\nCanada.[65]\r\n\r\nIf the remains of Foraminifera be dissolved in dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid, an organic basis is left, after the removal of the calcareous\r\nmatter, accurately retaining the form of the shell with all its\r\nopenings and pores. The earthy constituent is mainly calcium carbonate;\r\nbut there is also a small amount of phosphate of lime in the shells of\r\nmany of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.\r\n\r\n1. Separated prisms from outer layer of Pinna shell; 2. Skeletons of\r\nForaminifera from limestone; 3. Recent shell of _Polystomella crispa_;\r\nexamined under dark-ground illumination.]\r\n\r\n\r\nInfusoria.\r\n\r\nWe are now brought face to face with animals which possess considerable\r\nvariation of structure, _Infusorial animalcules_, as they are termed.\r\nIt was Ehrenberg who attributed to them a highly complex organisation,\r\nbut later observations negatived these views and showed them to\r\nbe animals formed of one or more cells, or colonies of so-called\r\nindividuals. It is true that this cell or united protoplasm may show\r\na wonderful amount of differentiation, what with its nucleus and\r\nvacuole, mouth and gullet, its variously-arranged cilia or flagella,\r\nits contractile fibres, its separation into an outer denser and a more\r\nfluid inner protoplasm, and its horny cup and stalks.\r\n\r\nIn these few lines we have a condensed summary of the special\r\nqualities of minute forms of life that afford much interesting work for\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.--Acineta, magnified 600 diameters (_Warne_).]\r\n\r\nAmong those widespread, and in some respects heterogeneous, forms\r\nof life associated under the comprehensive title of Infusoria, we\r\nencounter types that not only differ very widely from one another, but\r\nwhich occupy a different rank or position, so to speak, with regard\r\nto the relation they bear to each other, and also to the outlying\r\nrepresentatives of the series--differences that permeate throughout\r\nthe ranks of this extensive group. Furthermore, a considerable number\r\nof Infusorial animalcules foreshadow or typify, in a corresponding\r\ndegree, the separate or associated cell elements out of which higher\r\ntissue structures--metazoic organisms--are built up. We may take\r\nthe well-known example _Euglena viridis_ (Plate III., No. 67), or\r\nParamecium (No. 74), and their allies; these would appear to be the\r\nprototypes of Turbellaria. Another more lowly organised group of\r\nthe Ciliata exhibits a distinct and highly-interesting affinity to\r\nthe Opalinidæ. There are many other species (Acineta, Plate III.,\r\nNo. 68, for instance), which at first sight would seem to stand by\r\nthemselves and present no marked agreement with any metazoic type.\r\nIndeed, the function of these and other polypites consists simply in\r\nseizing food and conveying it through perforations at the extremity of\r\neach separate tentaculum to its interior. In Acineta certain of the\r\ntentacles only are suctorial, and these, being the inner ones, fulfil\r\nthe ingestive function, while the peripheral series are prehensile.\r\nThis stalked club-shaped body (Fig. 332), which fixes itself to\r\nseaweeds or Bryozoa, is seen to have a nucleus, and also clear vesicles\r\nin the body-substance; its embryos are ciliated. It is an object of\r\nconsiderable interest even among curious marine animalcules; one or two\r\nspecies inhabit fresh water. The spiral-mouthed Spirostomum are among\r\nthe largest of the class, and in sunlight are visible to the naked eye\r\nas slender golden threads of about 1/10th of an inch in length. The\r\nmouth slit, extending half the length of the body, is bordered on one\r\nside by cilia. The body is cylindrical and the surface covered with\r\nrows of cilia. Its multiplication takes place by transverse fission\r\nthrough the middle.\r\n\r\n_Flagellate Infusoria._--The characteristic of this group, as its\r\nname implies, is the possession of one or more flagella or whip-like\r\nappendages, at the base of which is an opening in the denser surface\r\nlayer of protoplasm, and in the interior a nucleus and one or more\r\ncontractile vacuoles, and not infrequently a brilliant red spot of\r\npigment known to microscopists as the eye-spot. The Monads, which\r\nconstitute the simplest members of the group, are commonly found in\r\nfresh-water pools and vegetable infusions. The typical form consists\r\nsimply of a spherical or oval cell provided with a flagellum.\r\nThe Volvox was formerly placed in this group, but as it contains\r\nchlorophyll it is properly claimed by the botanist. The collared\r\ngroup possesses cup-like collars, and these frequently secrete horny\r\nreceptacles or cups, and form elegant tree-like colonies.\r\n\r\nThe mail-coated group are of very varied form, the body being often\r\nprolonged into spiny processes. They have two long flagella which\r\nfit into grooves purposely provided. But the most interesting and\r\nremarkable are the phosphorescent animalcules (Noctiluca), whose\r\nbeautiful bluish-green luminosity on the surface of the sea has\r\nattracted attention from very early periods. It was, however, not\r\nuntil the first half of the present century that the luminosity was\r\ndiscovered to be due to the presence of multitudes of these minute\r\njelly-like spheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.--_Noctiluca miliaris_; magnified 150\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.--Pyrocystis; magnified 150 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe body of the Noctiluca (Fig. 333) is a nearly globular-shaped cyst,\r\nenclosed in a tough membranous wall, from a grooved opening in which\r\na striated muscular flagellum or proboscis is projected forth, and it\r\nis by means of this the animal swims away even in rough seas. A fine\r\nwhip-like flagellum is also located in the same groove. At the apex\r\nof the funnel there is a mass of protoplasm which extends itself as a\r\nwidely-meshed, highly-vacuolated network to the inner wall of the cyst,\r\nwhence it is believed the phosphorescent light emanates. It multiplies\r\nby self-division, first becoming encysted after withdrawing its\r\nflagellum, and then breaking up into numerous ciliated helmet-shaped\r\nswarm spores. Frequently two organisms fuse into one and then divide\r\ninto spores.\r\n\r\nNoctiluca mainly confines itself to the shallower seas, but there are\r\nrelated forms met with in the warmer open seas; these belong to the\r\ngenus Pyrocystis (Fig. 334). In one variety the body is perfectly\r\nspherical and without the big flagellum or proboscis. Professor\r\nButschli, however, regards this species as an encysted or resting phase\r\nof the commoner and better-known form.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Philip Gosse, F.R.S., was the first microscopist to\r\ndescribe the Noctiluca. After careful observation, he wrote in his\r\n“Naturalist’s Rambles” as follows:--“I had an opportunity of becoming\r\nacquainted with the minute animals to which a great portion of the\r\nluminousness of the sea is attributed. One of my large glass vases of\r\nsea-water I had observed to become suddenly at night, when tapped with\r\nthe finger, studded with minute but brilliant sparks at various points\r\non the surface of the water. I set the jar in the window, and was not\r\nlong in discovering, without the aid of a lens, a goodly number of\r\nthe tiny jelly-like globules of _Noctiluca miliaris_ swimming about\r\nin various directions. They swam with an even gliding motion, much\r\nresembling that of the _Volvox globator_ of our fresh-water pools.\r\nThey congregated in little groups, and a shake of the vessel sent\r\nthem darting down from the surface. It was not easy to keep them in\r\nview when seen, owing rather to their extreme delicacy and colourless\r\ntransparency than to their minuteness. They were, in fact, distinctly\r\nappreciable by the naked eye, measuring from 1/50th to 1/30th of an\r\ninch in diameter.”\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous fresh-water members of the flagellate infusoria,\r\nthere is one which especially calls for notice, Codosiga, discovered\r\nby the late Professor H. J. Clark. This minute body bears a delicate\r\nfunnel-shaped protoplasmic expansion or collar, common to the several\r\nmembers of this organic series. The flagellum is placed at the base\r\nof the oral opening, and within the circumscribed area of the collar,\r\nwhich is of such extreme tenuity that its true form and nature can\r\nonly be determined by a very careful adjustment of the achromatic\r\ncondenser and accessory apparatus employed, together with a wide-angled\r\nobjective. It is seen to greater advantage by supplying the animal\r\nwith very fine particles of colouring matter. In this way it is found\r\nthat the infundibuliform cup consists of protoplasm, through which\r\nthe flagellum is protruded and withdrawn into the general substance\r\nof the Monad’s body (Fig. 335). As many as twenty or more zooids are\r\nattached to the extremity of a slender footstalk. The length of the\r\nbody, exclusive of the collar, is 1/2500th to the 1/1200th of an inch.\r\nThe habitat of these bodies is fresh water. Mr. Saville Kent in 1869\r\ndiscovered some of these interesting infusoria in the London Docks.\r\n\r\n“The more exact significance of the special organ, the collar, is\r\nmanifest by the circulatory currents or cyclosis induced, and there can\r\nbe no room for doubt that this structure finds its precise homologue\r\nin the pseudopodia of the foraminiferous group of the Rhizopoda, in\r\nwhich a similar circulation or cyclosis of the constituent sarcode is\r\nexhibited. The whole of this highly-interesting flagellate order, a\r\ncomparatively small one as yet, are remarkable for their pale glaucous\r\ngreen or florescent hue, such colour assisting materially in their\r\nrecognition, even when the magnifying power employed is insufficient\r\nfor the detection of the very characteristic collar with its enclosed\r\nflagellum.”[66]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 335.--_Codosiga umbellata_; a few colonies of Zooids diverging\r\nfrom the parent foot-stalk with flagella extended, magnified 650\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\n_Ciliata._--Types of Ciliata obtained from hay infusions are very\r\nnumerous. Ehrenberg’s animalcules were mainly of a large size, and\r\nof those belonging to the higher order of the Ciliata, pertaining\r\nto such genera as Paramecium, Colpoda, Cyclidium, Oxytricha, and\r\nVorticella. These, however, represent but an insignificant minority\r\nof the hosts of flagellate forms which abound in our humid climate,\r\nand in hay infusions in particular. In such infusions, watched from\r\nday to day and produced from hay obtained from different localities,\r\nthe number of types developed in regular sequence is found to be\r\nperfectly marvellous, commencing with the _Monas_ proper, Amphimonas\r\nand Heteromita; while Bacteria, in their motile and quiescent forms,\r\nare invariably present and furnish an abundant supply of material for\r\nthe microscope.[67]\r\n\r\nVorticellidæ constitute one of the most numerous families of the\r\nciliate infusoria. All its members are at once recognised by their\r\nnormal stationary condition, and by the structure of their oral\r\nsystem. In but few of the genera is there any marked divergence\r\nfrom this formula, and when any exists it is made manifest by an\r\nincrease in development of some one of its elements at the expense\r\nof another. For instance, in the genus Spirochona, the external edge\r\nof the encircling border or peristome is suppressed, while the inner\r\nportion is abnormally developed into a transparent and highly elevated\r\nspiral membrane. The bell-animalcules usually possess stalks, and are\r\neither solitary or form branching colonies. _Conichilus vorticella_\r\n(Plate III., No. 80) is a well-known member of the colony stock, all\r\nthe zooids of which are united on a slender branching pedicle, which\r\nconsists of a central contractile cord enclosed within a tubular\r\nhyaline sheath. There are many other shrub-like colonies all variously\r\nmodified in form and character. The _Epistylis opercularia_, or\r\nnodding-bell animalcule, is an interesting member of a numerous host of\r\nsolitary short-stalked forms (Fig. 337). When the animal is disturbed,\r\nthe heads drop down towards the stalk. This animalcule has been\r\nfound to form a colony; and another, Carchesium, whose tiny branched\r\ntree-like colonies resemble little white globular masses of moulds, are\r\nseen at once to drop down towards the base of the colony with a jerky\r\nmovement if the cell be touched. By a process of encysting, all the\r\nVorticellæ and many of the more highly-organised ciliata have the means\r\nof what may be termed self-preservation. Should the water dry up in\r\nwhich they have been living, the little animal encases itself in mud at\r\nthe bottom of the pool. Should this be baked by the sun not the least\r\ninjury arises, for at this stage it crumbles into dust, and is carried\r\nby the wind to long distances, but the first shower of rain calls it\r\nback to active life, and soon after it is seen to issue forth as a free\r\nswimming bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336.--_Vorticella microstoma._]\r\n\r\n_Thuricola valvata_ (Plate III., No. 72) possesses a hinge-like process\r\nwhich closes up like a door when the animal contracts itself into its\r\ncase. This very effectually protects it from assault. Both portions of\r\nthe valve are capable of extension. Another group of ciliate infusoria\r\nalso possess a limited number of cilia, but these, although restricted\r\nto the under surface of their bodies, have an unrestricted range\r\nof motion. The group are all free swimmers, belonging to the genus\r\nOxytricha. They possess two separate alimentary orifices, neither of\r\nwhich are situated at the extremities or encased by a dense integument.\r\nTheir locomotive organs consist either of setæ, vibratile cilia, or\r\nnon-vibratile styles or uncini, variously situated, and all serving\r\nto make these infusorial animals very active (Plate III., Nos. 73 and\r\n77). A typical species is the mussel-animalcule (Stylonychia, Fig.\r\n338), common in all infusions and pools of water. Its body is oval\r\nand flattened, and about 1/100th of an inch in length. At one end a\r\nfunnel-shaped depression or mouth, with a ciliated margin, leads to\r\nthe inner part of the body, in which are two oval bodies, a nucleus\r\nand a contractile vacuole, which is seen to contract rhythmically. The\r\ncreature can also stalk along by means of its cilia or setæ, and set\r\nup currents to the mouth. Plate III., Nos. 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74, are\r\ntypes of these interesting bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.--Nodding-bell animalcule (_Epistyles\r\noperculata_) × 250 (Warne).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338.--Mussel-animalcule (_Stylonychia mytilus_)\r\nunder surface.\r\n\r\n_a._ Mouth; _b._ Contractile vacuole; _c._ Nucleus. (Magnified 150\r\ndiameters.)]\r\n\r\nDr. Balbini believes a true sexual generation occurs among these\r\norganisms, but, with the exception of the Paramecium, this has not been\r\nseen to take place; even Gruber’s more recent investigations appear to\r\nbe inconclusive on this point. Conjugation, however, it is said takes\r\nplace among some attached forms, as in the Stentors. These have been\r\nseen to put forth a bud from the body base, and soon after become free\r\nswimming bodies. The trumpet-animalcule (Stentor), a conspicuous member\r\nof the ciliata, is comparatively large, being about the 1/25th of an\r\ninch in length when extended to the full size. It is usually found\r\nattached to the under sides of duckweed, and is continually changing\r\nits form from that of a small knob when contracted, to the trumpet\r\nshape seen in Fig. 339, No. 6, when fully extended, and from which it\r\nderives its name. The long cilia projected from the upper part form a\r\nspiral within the margin of the open mouth leading to the digestive\r\nsac. A contractile vacuole lies to the right of the oral opening. New\r\nindividuals are produced by the process of budding, and in the form of\r\nciliated embryos from the nucleus. Stentors are commonly met with in\r\nfresh water, and are usually of a brilliant green colour. These little\r\nbodies will bear cutting up: if only a fragment of the nucleus be\r\nincluded in the section, the injury is soon repaired.\r\n\r\n_Rotifera_, or _Wheel-animalcules_ (Fig. 339).--In this group we have\r\na higher type of animal, with a more complex organisation than those\r\npreviously noticed. The great majority inhabit fresh water, and are\r\nreadily developed in hay infusions, in bog-moss, in house-top gutters,\r\neverywhere if looked for after a shower of rain. The rotating organs\r\nfrom which these fascinating animalcula derive their name consist of\r\ntwo disc-like bodies whose margins are fringed with rows of cilia,\r\nwhich create currents toward the oral aperture, and which have given\r\nrise to the optical delusion of rotating wheels. The disposition of the\r\ncilia is so arranged as to bring food to the rotifer and conduct it to\r\nthe mastax or digesting apparatus--a muscular bulb moved by a series\r\nof muscles--the gastric glands and stomach. The great transparency of\r\nthe whole structure permits of the animal economy being easily studied.\r\nThe body is covered with a horny envelope of two layers, and is divided\r\ninto segmental divisions, which slide into each other telescopic\r\nfashion. Consequently, as the water dries up, the animal is for a\r\nlong time rendered indestructible and capable of resisting varying\r\ntemperatures and the action of caustic reagents.\r\n\r\nRotifers are oviparous, and their eggs are conspicuous and of three\r\nkinds. The common soft-shelled eggs produce females, the smaller and\r\nmore spherical produce males. The ephippial, or summer eggs, are often\r\nbeset with spines or bosses; these have only a membranous covering,\r\nand are hatched soon after they are laid, or before leaving the ova\r\nsac. The male rotifer is but a third of the length of the female, often\r\nwithout cilia, and appears to have no alimentary tract; indeed, the\r\nonly internal organ is a large sperm sac. Rotifers have been divided\r\nby Dr. Hudson and the late Mr. Gosse in their charming work on these\r\nvery interesting “Wheel-animalcules” into four orders, according to\r\ntheir powers of locomotion, as follows:--(1) Rhizota, the rooted;\r\n(2) Bdelloida, the leech-like, that swim and creep like a leech; (3)\r\nPloïma, the sea-worthy, that only swim with their ciliary wreath; (4)\r\nScirtopoda, the skippers, that swim with their cilia and skip with\r\narthropodous limbs. These, again, are subdivided into families. With\r\nsuch hardy creatures as Philodina, Adineta, Brachionus, &c., creatures\r\nto whom extremes of cold, heat, and drought are the ordinary conditions\r\nof life, nothing can be easier to keep going throughout the year. Mr.\r\nC. F. Rousselet, who has so thoroughly succeeded in mounting Rotifers\r\nwith their cilia fully extended, recently exhibited at one of the\r\nevening meetings of the Royal Microscopical Society, London, no less\r\nthan four hundred specimens in a natural and perfect condition, the\r\nnervous system being seen more clearly from its successful staining\r\nthroughout the body than in the living rotifer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339.\r\n\r\n1. _Rotifer vulgaris_ with its cilia; _b._ rotating; _c._ horn;\r\n_d._ œsophagus; _f._ outer case; _g._ ova, foot protruding through\r\nouter case. 2.

This comprises at present a\r\nvery small group. The Œcistes is a member of the family (Plate III.,\r\nNo. 69). A single ciliary wreath leads to the alimentary canal, and a\r\npharyngeal bulb or mastax comprises the apparatus of nutrition. The\r\nvisual organs are red, as in other rotifers, and the ovarium contains\r\nseveral ova, shown in No. 69. The envelope is a gelatinous transparent\r\nsheath, into which the animalcule can withdraw itself, its attachment\r\nto the bottom being by the end of the foot-like tail. The most\r\ninteresting among this genus are the Floscularians. These creatures may\r\nundoubtedly be described as among the most beautiful and interesting of\r\ninfusorial animals.\r\n\r\nThe Stephanoceros, “crowned animalcule,” as it is termed, is about\r\n1/36th of an inch in length, and enclosed in a transparent cylindrical\r\nflexible case, beyond which it protrudes five long arms in a graceful\r\nmanner. These, touching at their points, give a form from which it\r\nderives its name. These arms are furnished with several rows of short\r\ncilia, which seize the food brought within their grasp until it can be\r\nswallowed. In addition to the rotatory organs, they have short flexible\r\nprocesses, or cornu, attached to the outside of one or more of their\r\nlobes. The water vascular system consists of two canals arising from\r\na small pyriform contractile vesicle, situated below the stomach. The\r\nova, after leaving the ova sac, remain quiescent until their cilia are\r\ndeveloped. Floscularians, like Melicertans, have a certain affinity in\r\nform with Vorticellians and Stentors, and also with Campanulariæ, among\r\npolypes. Their cilia are less regular when in action than in other\r\nRotatoria. When they retreat into their transparent cells they appear\r\nto fold themselves up. Their internal structure can be seen through the\r\nexternal case, and ova are observed enclosed in an ova sac; when thrown\r\noff they remain quiescent until the formation of their cilia. The whole\r\nfamily furnish interesting objects for microscopic investigation.\r\n\r\n_Melicerta ringens_ (“beaded Melicerta”).--Of all the Melicerta, or\r\n“horny floscularia,” this is the most beautiful. Its crystalline body\r\nis enclosed in a pellucid covering, wider at the top than the bottom,\r\nof a dark yellow or reddish-brown colour, which gradually becomes\r\nencrusted by zones of a variety of shapes, cemented together with a\r\npeculiar secretion that hardens in water. It derives its name from\r\nthese pellets, which have the appearance of rows of beads. Mr. Gosse\r\nfurnished an excellent account of the architectural instincts of\r\n_Melicerta ringens_: “An animalcule so minute as to be with difficulty\r\nappreciable by the naked eye, inhabiting a tube composed of pellets,\r\nwhich it forms and lays one by one. It is a mason who not only builds\r\nup his mansion brick by brick, but makes his bricks as he goes on, from\r\nsubstances which he collects around him, shaping them in a mould which\r\nhe carries on his body.\r\n\r\n“The pellets composing the case are very regularly placed in position;\r\nin a fine specimen, about the 1/30th of an inch in length, when fully\r\nexpanded, as many as fifteen longitudinal rows of pellets were counted,\r\nwhich gave about thirty-two rows in all. As it exposes itself more and\r\nmore, suddenly two large rounded discs are expanded, around which,\r\nat the same instant, a wreath of cilia is seen performing surprising\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n“On mixing carmine with the water, the course of the ciliary current\r\nis readily traced, and forms a fine spectacle. The particles are\r\nhurled round the margin of the disc, until they pass off in front\r\nthrough the great sinus, between the larger petals. If the pigment be\r\nabundant, the cloudy torrent for the most part rushes off, and prevents\r\nour seeing what takes place; but if the atoms be few, we see them\r\nswiftly glide along the facial surface, following the irregularities\r\nof outline with beautiful precision, dash round the projecting chin\r\nlike a fleet of boats doubling a bold headland, and lodge themselves,\r\none after another, in the little cup-like receptacle beneath. Mr.\r\nGosse, believing that the pellets of the case might be prepared in\r\nthe cup-like receptacle, watched the animal, and presently had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing it bend its head forward, as anticipated, and\r\nafter a second or two raise it again; the little cup having in the\r\nmeantime lost its contents. It immediately began to fill again; and\r\nwhen it was full, and the contents were consolidated by rotation,\r\naided probably by the admixture of a salivary secretion, it was again\r\nbent down to the margin of the case, and emptied of its pellet. This\r\nprocess he saw repeated many times in succession, until a goodly array\r\nof dark-red pellets were laid upon the yellowish-brown ones, but\r\nvery irregularly. After a certain number were deposited in one part,\r\nthe animal would suddenly turn itself round in its case, and deposit\r\nsome in another part. It took from two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half\r\nminutes to make and deposit a pellet.”\r\n\r\nMelicerta may be found in clear pools, mill-ponds, and other places\r\nthrough which a current of water gently flows. If a portion of\r\nwater-weed be brought home and placed in a small glass zoophyte-trough,\r\nand carefully examined with a magnifying power of about fifty\r\ndiameters, a few delicate-looking projections of a reddish-brown colour\r\nwill probably be seen adhering to the plant; these are the tubular\r\ncases of Melicerta, which, after a short period of rest, will be seen\r\nto be animals of 1/12th of an inch or more in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nPorifera. Spongiadæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340.--_Spongia panicea._\r\n\r\nBread-crumb Sponge, showing currents entering surface _a_, and leaving\r\nby oscules _b_.]\r\n\r\n_Sponges._--The term Porifera, or “canal-bearing zoophytes,” was\r\napplied by the late Dr. Grant to designate the remarkable class of\r\norganisms known as sponges, met with in every sea, and numbering\r\nabout two thousand species, varying in size from a pin’s head to\r\nmasses several feet in height; and weighing from a few grains to\r\nover a hundred pounds. Sponges assume an endless variety of shapes,\r\nas cups, vases, spheres, tubes, baskets, branched-like trees, but\r\noften as shapeless masses. When living they are all colours and all\r\nconsistences, soft and gelatinous, fleshy, leathery or stony. A fuller\r\nknowledge of sponges was gained in 1825, when Dr. Robert Grant examined\r\na fragment of living sponge under the microscope. On bringing it to\r\nthe side of the glass cell in which he had preserved it, he beheld\r\nthis living fountain pouring forth a torrent of liquid matter in rapid\r\nsuccession, and he was at once convinced that a current flowed out of\r\nthe larger orifices. He introduced a small portion of fine chalk, and\r\nsaw particles driven into the interior, and pass out again by different\r\nways. To determine the cause of the currents, it was necessary to make\r\na closer examination of the anatomy of the sponge. For this purpose\r\nhe cut or peeled off thin sections, and saw that the whole substance\r\nwas divided into flagellated chambers, enclosing spherical and other\r\nbodies, and perforated by pores. Each chamber proved to be about\r\n1/500th of an inch in diameter, groups of them opening by a wider\r\norifice into a common space, or canaliculus, and joining others to\r\nform canals terminating in larger oscular canals. The walls throughout\r\nare lined with flat cells, but in the flagellated chambers the living\r\ncells are more or less cylindrical, and each is provided at the free\r\nend with a whip-like appendage, or flagellum. Furthermore the upper\r\nmargin was seen to be expanded into a thin hyaline collar, so that the\r\nwhip appeared to have its origin in the centre of a basin or funnel.\r\nThe currents of water traversing the body of the sponge are kept up by\r\nthe movements of the flagella of the collar-cells. These beat the water\r\nin the flagellated chambers into the rootlets of the canals leading to\r\nthe oscules. To replace this, water flows into the flagellated chambers\r\nfrom the rootlets of the canals passing down from the groups of pores\r\nin the skin. The currents entering the sponge bring in oxygenated\r\nsea-water and minute food particles, such as diatoms and infusorial\r\norganisms; the currents from the oscules contain an excess of carbonic\r\nacid of waste products, resulting from vital activity and indigestible\r\nremains. The cells lining the canals effect the exchange of gases, and\r\ntake up food particles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 341.--A section of a flagellate chamber of a Fresh-water Sponge,\r\nshowing collar-cells (Vosmaer).]\r\n\r\nProfessor Grant’s careful and instructive researches were begun on\r\nthe smaller kind of British sponges hanging down from rocks (_Spongia\r\ncoalita_), and on which he gazed for “twenty-five minutes, until\r\nobliged to withdraw his eyes from fatigue.” This sponge fixes itself\r\nby a root; and the currents enter through the stem and body, and leave\r\nprincipally by oscules placed on the branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342.--An Ascon Sponge.\r\n\r\nA. Magnified × 20 diameters; B. × 80 diameters; C. Transverse section;\r\nD. Collar-cells, × 700 diameters. The embryo, an extremely minute oval\r\ncyst, is furnished with a flagellum for swimming; in the third it\r\nassumes an amœboid form (Warne.)]\r\n\r\nAt present too little is known as to the physiology of digestion in\r\nsponges to permit of a definite statement on the subject. In specimens\r\nfed upon carmine the collar-cells have been found loaded with granules;\r\nin others, again, the flat cells lining the subdermal cavities have\r\nbeen found gorged with colour granules. From Bowerbank’s monograph\r\non the British Spongiadæ (1864 and 1874) nothing of importance can\r\nbe gained on the subject; in fact, it relates almost entirely to the\r\nstructure and organisation of sponges in their dried or preserved\r\ncondition, and therefore is only of value for purposes of specific\r\nidentification. One of the simplest of living sponges, the microscopic\r\nstructure of which it is possible to trace, _Ascetta primordialis_,\r\nis found on seaweeds in the Mediterranean. In its simple unbranched\r\ncondition it forms a minute white sac about one twenty-fifth of an inch\r\nin height, opening above by a wide round oscule and narrowing below to\r\na stalk (Fig. 342). The walls are very thin and perforated by pores,\r\nthrough which the water passes into the interior. The walls of the\r\nsac are composed of two layers, an inner lining of collar-cells, and\r\nan outer layer consisting of a gelatinous matrix containing amœboid\r\nbodies and transparent three-rayed spicules. These serve to support\r\nthe walls and as a frame-work for the pores, as in all the sponges. By\r\neliminating the spicular skeleton, and by supposing the tube to be more\r\nglobular, the “olynthus form” will be obtained, which has been regarded\r\nas the hypothetical ancestor of all sponges. A canal system arises when\r\nthe walls grow thick or form folds, or give off pouches or tubes. From\r\nthese channels arise incipient in-current canals, between the inside\r\nor lumen of the folds and that forming the out-current canal system.\r\n\r\nThere is a common ciliated Sycon found on seaweed round the British\r\ncoast; it has the appearance of a white sac about an inch in height,\r\nwith a crown of glassy spicules around the orifice. The vertical cavity\r\nof the sac is surrounded by a wall of closely-packed horizontal tubes,\r\nopening at their inner ends into the central cavity, but externally\r\nending blindly. The central cavity of the sac is surrounded or lined\r\nwith flat-cells, and the radial tubes with collar-cells, and the walls\r\nof the tubes are perforated. Here the spaces between and outside\r\nthe densely-packed tubes are the in-current canals. In an equally\r\ncommon British sponge, Grantia, which forms small flat white bags, a\r\nrudimentary cortex covers the outer ends of the tubes. In Grantiopois,\r\nthe cortex becomes quite thick; as the radial tubes in this species\r\nbecome more branched and the mesoderm thicker, so the passages or\r\nin-current canals become more complicated. Common silicious, sponges\r\ndevelop in a different manner from the calcareous ones, namely, from a\r\nhollow conical sac open at the top and with a flat base; the spherical\r\nflagellated chambers at a very early stage forming a mammillated\r\nlayer in the walls. Plakina, one of the simplest silicious sponges,\r\nencrusts stones with a fleshy crust, consisting of a sac with a flat\r\nbase attached to the stone in sucker-like fashion, and with the rest\r\nof the walls forming simple folds. The spaces between and outside the\r\nfolds form the in-current, and those in the lumen of the folds the\r\nout-current, channels. Each of the flagellated chambers in the walls\r\nof the folds communicates with the in-current spaces through several\r\npores, and opens into the out-current spaces by one large pore, the\r\ncurrents of water passing out by the central oscule. Here we have a\r\ngeneral idea of the formation of all the commoner forms of sponges. In\r\nthe more delicate species, as that of Venus’ flowerbasket, the cells\r\nare formed by a trellis work of large spicules of silica. Groups of\r\ncells congregate in the ground substance and secrete a network of\r\ncylindrical fibres and spicules, which, although they remain to a\r\ncertain extent separate, are always beautifully adapted for purposes of\r\nsupport. In addition to the support these afford, the skeleton spicules\r\nafford a means of defence against the attacks of small animals.[68]\r\n\r\nA fairly good idea will be gained of the internal structure of sponges\r\nfrom the section made of a _Geodia Barretti_, Fig. 343.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343.--_Geodia Barretti_ (Bowerbank).\r\n\r\nA tangential section of geodia sponge exhibiting the radial d\r\nisposition of the fasciculi of the skeleton, and a portion of the\r\nmesoderm of the sponge, magnified 50 diameters; _a._ intermarginal\r\ncavities; _b._ a basal intermarginal cavity; _c._ ova imbedded in the\r\ndermal crust of the sponge; _d._ large patentoternate spicula, the\r\nheads of which form areas for the valvular bases of the intermarginal\r\ncavities; _e._ recurvo-ternate defensive and aggressive spicula within\r\nthe summits of the intercellular spaces of the sponge; _f._ portion\r\nof the interstitial membrane of sponge, crowded with minute stellate\r\nspicula; _g._ portions of the secondary system of external defensive\r\nspicula.]\r\n\r\n_Reproduction._--As regards the modes of reproduction, both male and\r\nfemale cells are found in the mesoderm. The male cells generally\r\ngive rise by division of the nucleus to masses of spermatozoa, each\r\nof which possesses a conical head and a long vibratile filament. The\r\nova appear as large round cells, and when conglomerated in masses,\r\nresemble those of Micro-gromia, which, after fertilisation, undergo\r\nsegmentation or division, first into two cells, and again dividing and\r\nsub-dividing, until a cluster or mass of cells results (as seen\r\nin Fig. 343). The outer layer of the egg-shaped embryo becomes more\r\ncylindrical in shape, and is now provided with cilia, and soon appears\r\nas an independent minute oval body. If a bread-crumb sponge be cut open\r\nin the autumn, the embryos will be seen as bright yellow spots within\r\nthe body-substance. By keeping specimens in a vessel of water, the\r\nembryos will be seen to escape from the oscules, and swim freely about\r\nwith the broad end forwards. After twenty-four hours of independent\r\nexistence, the embryo remains stationary, and fixes itself by its broad\r\nend, which becomes flattened out. By a remarkable transformation, the\r\nlarger granular cells of the interior burst out and grow over the outer\r\nflagellate layer of cells, and the latter become the collar-cells of\r\nthe adult sponge. A minute sponge with one oscule results from the\r\ndevelopment of the fertilised ovum. An extensive crust with numerous\r\noscules may be regarded either as a colony in which each oscule\r\nrepresents an individual, or simply as one individual in which the\r\ngrowth of the body necessitates the formation of new channels for the\r\nconveyance of food materials. The embryos of some of the fresh-water\r\nsponges (Spongillidæ) living in ponds, canals, lakes and rivers all\r\nover the world, as soon as they become fertilised undergo segmentation,\r\nand form oval ciliated bodies, in appearance somewhat resembling the\r\ngastrula of Monoxenia, one of the simplest kinds of corals. Fresh-water\r\nsponges are green in colour, due to the granular bodies which crowd the\r\ncells near the surface of the sponge; that this colour is not due to\r\nthe formation of chlorophyll is seen on keeping them in a shady place,\r\nwhen they become pale grey or yellowish-brown, and if kept quite in the\r\ndark they entirely lose all colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nSKELETONS AND SPICULA OF SPONGES.]\r\n\r\nA few sponges possess no skeleton whatever, excepting the gelatinous\r\nground substance; in some specimens the skeleton is mainly or entirely\r\ncomposed of foreign particles of sand or the remains of Foraminifera.\r\nOthers are composed of calcium carbonate, and form the class Calcarea,\r\nthe spicules of which are white, and opaque in mass; but on placing\r\nportions in hydrochloric acid, the skeleton is dissolved away with\r\neffervescence, and the spicules are left behind transparent and glassy.\r\nA great variety is seen in the different species, as will be gathered\r\nfrom the few typical forms shown in Plate XVI., and which even in\r\ntheir fossilised state remain unaltered, the silica which enters so\r\nlargely into their composition being indestructible, the calcareous\r\nmatter alone becoming separated in exposure to the action of air, or by\r\nboiling in hydrochloric acid. The only perceptible difference noticed\r\nis an increase in transparency, and this, on mounting them in Canada\r\nbalsam, adds to their beauty when examined by polarised light.\r\n\r\nHyalonema, the “glass-rope” sponge of Japan, consists of a bundle\r\nof from 200 to 300 threads of transparent silica, glistening with a\r\nsatiny lustre like the most brilliant spun glass; each thread is about\r\neighteen inches long, in the middle the thickness of a knitting-needle,\r\nand gradually tapering towards either end to a fine point; the whole\r\nbundle coiled like a strand of rope into a lengthened spiral, the\r\nthreads of the middle and lower portions remaining compactly coiled\r\nby a permanent twist of the individual threads; the upper portions of\r\nthe coil frayed out, so that the glassy threads stand separate from\r\neach other. The spicules on the outside of the coil stretch its entire\r\nlength, each taking about two and a half turns of the spiral. One of\r\nthese long needles is about one-third of a line in diameter in the\r\ncentre, gradually tapering towards either end. The spirally-twisted\r\nportion of the needle occupies rather more than the middle half of its\r\nentire length. In the lower portion of the coil, which is embedded in\r\nthe sponge, the spicule becomes straight, and tapers down to an extreme\r\ntenuity, ultimately becoming so fine that it is scarcely possible to\r\ntrace it to its termination.\r\n\r\nWithin the mesoderm, and in oscule, was noticed a deep brownish-orange\r\ncoloured shrunken membrane; this was traced to a parasitic polyp.\r\nSince this was first observed on an early specimen of the Japanese\r\nglass-sponge, the same parasite has always been found growing on and\r\nin all these curious sponges. The surface of the stalk above the\r\nportion embedded in the mud is seen to be covered with a warty crust\r\nof parasitic polyps. All the specimens of Hyalonema in the European\r\nmuseums in 1860 had their stalks overgrown with Palythoa, while many\r\nhad their bodies also covered with another parasite, and which,\r\nfortunately for the sponge, did not form a sandy crust. The polyps,\r\nhaving no skeleton, dry up entirely, and leave behind no trace except\r\nthe stain first referred to. Unlike a parasite, however, the polyps do\r\nnot feed upon the juices and soft parts of the sponge, nor indeed do\r\nthey share its food, but simply settle upon the sponge and feed upon\r\nany food that may chance to come within their reach.\r\n\r\nThe dredgings of the _Challenger_ brought to the surface many entirely\r\nnew forms of glass-sponges and from great depths. One of the most\r\nbeautiful, known as Carpenter’s glass-sponge (Pheronema), is composed\r\nof concentric laminæ of silica deposited around a fine central axial\r\ncanal. These form a gauze-like network throughout, but with no\r\nregularity of structure.\r\n\r\n_Clionæ._--Not the least wonderful circumstance connected with the\r\nhistory of sponges is the power possessed by certain species of boring\r\ninto substances, the hardness of which might be considered as a\r\nsufficient protection against such apparently contemptible foes. Shells\r\n(both living and dead), coral, and even solid rocks are attacked by\r\nthese humble destroyers, gradually broken up, and, no doubt, finally\r\nreduced to such a state as to render substances which would otherwise\r\nremain dead and useless in the economy of nature available for the\r\nsupply of the necessities of other living creatures.\r\n\r\nThese boring sponges constitute the genus Cliona of Dr. Grant. They are\r\nbranched in form, or consist of lobes united by delicate stems, and\r\nafter having buried themselves in shells or other calcareous objects,\r\npreserve their communication with the water by means of perforations in\r\nthe outer wall of the shell. The mechanism by which a creature of so\r\nlow a type of organisation contrives to produce effects so remarkable\r\nis still doubtful, from the great difficulties which lie in the way of\r\ncoming to any satisfactory conclusions upon the habits of an animal\r\nthat works so completely in the dark as the _Cliona celata_. Mr.\r\nHancock, in his valuable memoir upon the boring sponges, attributes\r\ntheir excavating power to the presence of the multitude of minute\r\nsilicious crystalline particles adhering to the surface of the sponge;\r\nthese he supposes are set in motion by ciliary action. In whatever\r\nway this action may be produced, however, there can be no doubt that\r\nthese sponges are constantly and silently effecting the disintegration\r\nof submarine calcareous bodies--the shelly coverings, it may be, of\r\nanimals far higher in organisation, and in many instances they prove\r\nthemselves formidable enemies even to living molluscs, by boring\r\ncompletely through the shell. In this case the animal whose domicile it\r\nso unceremoniously invades has no alternative but to raise a wall of\r\nnew shelly matter between himself and his unwelcome guest, and in this\r\nmanner generally succeeds in barring him out.\r\n\r\nFrom a close examination of the structural and developmental\r\ncharacters of the Spongideæ, it must be conceded that they belong\r\nrather to the flagellata Protozoa than to any other order. This was\r\nthe view held by the late Professor Clark, and Mr. Saville Kent quite\r\nconcurs in it.[69] Summing up the entire evidence adduced, scarcely\r\na shadow of doubt is admissible concerning the intimate relationship\r\nthat subsists between the Choano-flagellata and other flagellate\r\nProtozoa and that of sponges. The primary and essential element of\r\nthe apparently complex sponge stock is the assemblage of collared\r\nflagellate zooids that inhabit its interstitial cavities under various\r\nplans of distribution. Individually these collared zooids correspond\r\nstructurally and functionally in every detail with the collared units\r\nof such genera as Codosiga, Salpingœca, and Proto-spongia. The collar\r\nin either case presents the same structure and functions, exhibits\r\nthe same circulatory currents or cyclosis, and acts in the same way\r\nfor the capture of food. The body contains an identical centrally\r\nlocated spheroidal nucleus or endoplast, and a corresponding series\r\nof rhythmically pulsating contractile vesicles. The developmental\r\nreproductive phenomena are also strictly parallel. Both originate as\r\nsimple Amœba or simple flagellate Monads, exhibiting no trace in their\r\nearliest stage of the subsequently acquired characteristic collar. Both\r\nagain after a time withdraw their collar and flagellum, and assume the\r\namœboid state; then, coalescing, enter upon a quiescent or encysted\r\ncondition, and break up into a number of sporular bodies, and thus\r\nprovide for the further existence and distribution of the species.\r\nThe whole process again is much akin to that which obtains in the\r\nprotophytic type, _Volvox globator_, which liberates from its interior\r\nfree swimming gemmules that take the form of spherical aggregation of\r\nbiflagellate daughter-cells. In their isolated state, on the other\r\nhand, the swarm gemmules of the sponge stock are directly comparable\r\nwith the free swimming subspheroidal colony stock of the flagellate\r\ninfusoria Synura, Syncrypta, and Uroglena, or with the attached\r\nsubspheroidal clusters of Codosiga and Anthophysa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ECHINODERMATA, HYDROZOA, POLYZOA, HELMINTHOIDA.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nZoophytes, Cœlenterata, Medusæ, Corals, Hydrozoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344.--Gorgonia Nobilis.]\r\n\r\nA study of the earliest growth of the Cœlenterata has shown that their\r\ninternal cavities are nothing more than regular radiate out-growths of\r\nthe internal structures. The result of this development is a condition\r\nwhich does not occur again in the whole of the animal kingdom. There\r\nis a system of cavities all in open communication one with another, no\r\nclosed blood vascular system, and no specialised respiratory apparatus.\r\nAgain, all the animals that constitute this large group are radiate\r\nin structure, that is, when viewed from above they are typically\r\nstar-shaped, and if cut across, every horizontal section shows a\r\nsymmetrical arrangement of the several parts around a centre. There\r\nare other radiate animals, as the Echinoderms, but while in these five\r\nis the fundamental number of rays, in the Cœlenterata the rays are a\r\nmultiple of four, six and upwards. The skeleton or framework of each\r\ndiffers, and when the Cœlenterata form calcareous structures, these are\r\nquite different from the tests of the sea-urchins; and in all cases\r\nthe anterior portion of the body is crowned with one or more circles\r\nof tentacles, which remain perfectly flexible and flower-like. The\r\nmost highly-developed of the free forms are the sea-anemones and the\r\njelly-fish. These have no hard or calcareous skeleton whatever, but\r\nwithal they are, in the opinion of naturalists and microscopists, the\r\nmost beautiful objects among Zoophytes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their variety of forms, the Cœlenterata seem to be as\r\nincapable of higher development as do the Echinoderms, and they have\r\nfailed to make headway in fresh water, but it is not improbable that\r\nsome of the simplest forms of the whole group may have given rise to\r\nhigher animal forms, while the sea anemones, corals, &c., being those\r\ndescendants of the primitive simple form, have retained the original\r\ntype of organization almost unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345.--_Hydra viridis_, adhering to a stalk of\r\n_Anacharis alsinastrum_.]\r\n\r\nThe type of the group is the Hydra, a fresh-water polyp, commonly found\r\nattached to the leaves and stems of many aquatic plants, or floating\r\npieces of stick. Two species are well known to microscopists, the _H.\r\nviridis_, or green polyp, and the _H. vulgaris_, somewhat darker in\r\ncolour, probably dependent upon the nature of its food. The third,\r\nless common species, the _H. fasca_, is distinguished from both by the\r\nlength of its tentacles, which, when fully extended, greatly exceed\r\nthose of either of the before-mentioned. The fresh-water group measures\r\nfrom one-eighth to the one-third of an inch in length, and form simple\r\nstocks of one, two or more branches. They almost exactly resemble in\r\nform the polyps of the Hydractinia, which are provided with a circle of\r\ntentacles. When placed in a vessel of water and left undisturbed they\r\noften attach themselves to the side, where they may be examined with\r\na moderate power at leisure. They are then seen to spread out their\r\ntentacles like fine threads, and seize upon any small creature that may\r\ncome in their way, and by the same means convey it to a mouth capable\r\nof great extension. All Hydra possess stinging-cells, by means of which\r\nthey paralyse their prey. Many Hydra attain to a large size, and shoot\r\nout long poisonous filaments; they also possess smaller kinds of smooth\r\ncells, which appear to be employed for an entirely different purpose,\r\nbut for what is not positively known. Hydra usually multiply by means\r\nof buds, an out-growth from the body, and these remain attached to\r\nthe mother stalk for some time, often long enough to give rise to one\r\nor two smaller buds. Single eggs are also developed in the ectoderm\r\nbeneath capsules, or wart-like prominences. The adult animal can be cut\r\nto pieces, and from each piece a new individual will be developed. This\r\nmethod of reproduction was first tried by the naturalist Trembley in\r\n1739, whose experiments in this direction excited the greatest interest\r\namong the naturalists of the middle of the last century. _Hydra fusca_\r\nin various stages of development is given in outline in Fig. 346.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346.\r\n\r\n1, 2, 3. Hydra in various stages of development; 4. Group of _Stentor\r\npolymorphus_, many-shaped Stentor; 5. Englena; 6. Monads.]\r\n\r\nIn the polyps belonging to this family the body-structure for the most\r\npart consists of a homogeneous aggregation of vesicular granules, held\r\ntogether by an intercellular sarcode, and capable of great extension\r\nand contraction, so that these animals can assume a variety of forms\r\nand extend their body and tentacles until the latter become almost\r\ninvisible. It was the resemblance in this respect to the fabled Hydra\r\nthat originated the name. Its organ of prehension is termed the\r\n_hasta_; this consists of a sac or opening at the terminal end of the\r\ntentacle, within which is seen a saucer-shaped vesicle, supporting a\r\nminute ovate body, which carries a sharp calcareous piece termed a\r\n_sagitta_ or arrow. Although the fresh-water Hydra may be regarded\r\nas typical of this group of animals, marine fauna furnish a far more\r\nextensive group in the corals, jelly-fish, and sea-anemones.\r\n\r\nA smaller group, the Ctenophora, although members of this sub-kingdom,\r\nhave not yet found their true position; nevertheless they are\r\ninteresting glassy, transparent creatures, either shaped like apples,\r\nmelons, or Phrygian caps, or else forming bands of some considerable\r\nlength; all are wonderfully transparent, with the single exception of\r\nthe Beroë. These inhabit the open sea, and are only seen inshore when\r\ndriven in by currents or strong winds. Their position in the water is\r\nusually more or less vertical, the mouth being turned downwards. The\r\nportion from which this group derives its name is the ribs, which are\r\nsymmetrically arranged, and consist of rows of short transverse combs,\r\neach forming rows of cilia, which, as they wave to and fro, constitute\r\na swimming or rowing plate, their activity in the water depending upon\r\nthe will of the animal. They are also provided with an oral umbrella,\r\nand capturing filaments or tentacles with hair-like branches. These\r\ntentacles, attached to the sides of the animal, are capable of erection\r\nor withdrawal into pockets. Great variety is seen in these accessory\r\norgans of locomotion; for instance, the Cydippidæ (Plate XVII.) have\r\nonly arms, but these are remarkable for their length, and serve for\r\nthe purpose of capturing food as well as for steering. The most\r\ninteresting, if not the most beautiful of the Ctenophora, are the\r\nBeroidæ; it is this family that bear a resemblance to the Phrygian\r\ncap (Plate XVII., _e_). The mouth is wide, but it appears to have no\r\ncapturing tentacles, and yet their habits are carnivorous; they will\r\neven devour their own relations. Many of the genus are phosphorescent,\r\nand in place of stinging-cells have small spherical knobs beset with\r\nsticky globules, in which their food becomes entangled, and these are\r\napparently in constant use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nZOOPHYTES, ASTEROIDS, NUDIBRANCHIS, ACALEPS, ECHINOIDS, CTENOPHORA,\r\nTUNICATA, AND CRUSTACEANS.]\r\n\r\n_The Stinging Series_, _Cnidaria_, comprise sea-anemones, corals,\r\njelly-fish among marine animals, and Hydra among the fresh-water\r\nCœlenterata; and derive their name from a remarkably curious feature,\r\nthe so-called stinging capsules. These are not only offensive, but\r\nalso defensive weapons with all the animals belonging to this group;\r\nthe possession of which has converted the bell-like jelly-fish into\r\na simple Cnidarian. The principal change is in the gelatinous layer\r\nbetween the outer wall and the inner digesting layer of the ectoderm.\r\nBut without entering further into their structure and relations, the\r\nstinging-cells and batteries claim especial attention. These cells vary\r\nconsiderably in size without their characteristics being essentially\r\nchanged. The protoplasm of the cell is modified into a tolerably firm\r\nsubstance, enclosing an oval or cylindrical vesicle. Closely associated\r\nwith this is a pointed process, standing up far above the level of the\r\nouter covering, known as the _cnidocil_. Within the vesicle is found,\r\neither spirally rolled up or in an irregular tangle, a long filament\r\nor hollow tube, a prolongation of the vesicle, but turned outside in.\r\nThis tube is more than twenty times as long as the cell, is pointed\r\nat the tip, and beset with two rows of fine spirally-arranged barbed\r\nhooks. When the cnidocil is touched or irritated, this filament is\r\nviolently shot out, being then turned inside-out, like the fingers of\r\na glove. So long as the thread remains rolled up within the vesicle\r\nthe barbed hooks remain in their tube, but when shot out, they change\r\nto the outside. The rolled-up filament appears to be filled with\r\nsome poisonous material, which is ejected when the tube is shot out,\r\nand where the point strikes a wound is inflicted, so that unless the\r\nprey is stronger than the attacker it cannot escape. The greater the\r\nstruggle, the larger the number of capsules discharged in order to kill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347.--The Stinging Capsules of Cnidaria.\r\n\r\n1 and 2. Retracted filaments; 3. Partly protruded; 4. Fully protruded.\r\nMagnified × 600. (Warne.)]\r\n\r\n_Polypomedusæ._--Among the higher development of the stinging\r\ngroup is the jelly-fish. The Siphonophora, as represented by the\r\nPortuguese man-of-war, are in their turn the highest development of\r\nswimming-bells, and exhibit many modifications and combinations of\r\nindividuals. The tentacles of the Physalia, the best known, are stiff\r\nwith batteries of stinging-capsules, the sting of which is more like\r\nthe shock of the electric current. The _Challenger_ soundings brought\r\nto light some remarkably interesting forms, and these have furnished\r\nmuch work for the microscope, as all their larval forms are extremely\r\ncurious. Among the Hydromedusæ there are many different life histories.\r\nTake the jelly-fish, the eggs of which have given up forming stocks,\r\nand are hatched out at once as Medusæ. There are others, the eggs of\r\nwhich form stocks; others, again, in which the sexual individuals do\r\nnot swim away as jelly-fish. The last were at one time described under\r\na new name, because of one or two curious forms being taken creeping on\r\nthe ground. This creeping Medusa (_Clavatella prolifera_) has six arms,\r\nthe tips of which are provided with true suckers, and on these it walks\r\nas on stilts, while from each arm a short stalk arises, the swollen\r\nend of which is beset with stinging capsules. It has an extensile\r\nmouth-tube, and feeds upon small crustaceans found on seaweeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 348.--_Plumularia primata._ _Doris tuberculata_ seen clinging to a\r\nfucus.]\r\n\r\nAmong the forms that swim away as jelly-fish a very curious example\r\nis presented in _Corymorpha mutans_. These swim about for a time, and\r\nthen firmly attach themselves by numerous thread-like appendages,\r\nforced into the sand, and where the young prepare for their next\r\nmetamorphosis. As an example of the stocks of those representatives\r\nwhich do not swim away as jelly-fish, take the beautifully-feathered,\r\nplant-like creatures found erect along the seashore, the Sertularia\r\n(Fig. 358, No. 12) and Plumularia. _Plumularia primata_, Fig. 348.\r\nOther members of these groups will be found in Plate IV., Nos. 95-99.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.--Group of female stock of _Hydractinia\r\nechinata_.\r\n\r\n_a, a._ Nutritive individuals; _b, b._ Female individuals and groups of\r\neggs. Highly magnified.--(Warne.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nutritive individuals, there are the egg-bearing;\r\nthese do not become free-swimming individuals. One small family is\r\nneither branched nor feathered--the _Hydractinia echinata_, found in\r\nthe North Sea and on the Norwegian coasts, where it attaches itself to\r\nthe shells of gastropods, selecting those inhabited by hermit crabs.\r\nThe part of the stock common to all the individuals is the skin-like\r\nportion which adheres to the surface of the shell. In some spiny\r\nprocesses are produced, and the nutritive canals running down the stems\r\nof the polyps are continued into the membrane belonging to the stock,\r\nas seen in Fig. 349.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive individuals are distinguished by long tentacles, mouths,\r\nand digestive canals. The females have no mouths, and are supplied with\r\nfood through the system of canals running to them from the nutritive\r\nmales. These reproductive members are furnished with stinging threads\r\ninstead of tentacles for the protection of their ova. The ciliated\r\nlarvæ, in a very short time, swim off to found new colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350.--Medusæ, Jelly-fish.]\r\n\r\nThe free-swimming jelly-fish (Fig. 350, and Plate XVII., _c_ and _d_)\r\nbelong to the order Scyphomedusæ. These are characterised by their\r\ndelicate colouring, and from the arrangement of their nervous system,\r\nwhich can only be made out by staining. Some new and curious forms\r\nwere dredged from a depth of more than 6,000 feet off the coast of New\r\nZealand, varying in size from an inch to twenty inches; many having\r\nfrom four to eight or ten eyes arranged along the margin.\r\n\r\n_Anthozoa._--From the free-swimming we turn to a group of permanently\r\nfixed polyp forms, the sea-anemones and corals. The development of\r\nMonoxenia commences with the egg, repeatedly dividing into many parts\r\n(Fig. 351, C, D, and E), by a process common to the animal kingdom,\r\ntermed egg-segmentation, in this particular instance proceeding from\r\nan apparently hollow sphere, A, enclosing a single layer of cells,\r\nG. Each cell sends out a long cilia, or whip-like process, _F_, by\r\nmeans of which the larva turns about and swims in the body fluid of\r\nthe parent polyp. One half of the sphere now becomes enfolded into\r\nthe other half, H, and forms what is termed a _gastrula_, I, K. The\r\ngastrula stage of Monoxenia is of the simplest kind, the larva forming\r\na sac, with walls consisting of two layers, an outer, or ectoderm,\r\nand an inner, or endoderm. The transition from the flat dish shape,\r\nH, to the sac with a narrow mouth is at once clear, and the knowledge\r\nthat all the Cœlenterates proceed from similar larvæ, and that all the\r\ncomplications of their various systems are developed from a simple\r\ngastrula, throws much light on their anatomy. During these transitions\r\nthe endoderm, whose cells multiply, continues as an uninterrupted\r\nlining to the stomach and its appendages, while the ectoderm yields the\r\ncuticular elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.--Stages in development of _Monoxenia\r\nDarwinii_, × 600.--(Warne.)]\r\n\r\nA third intermediate gelatinous layer, the _mesoglæa_, arises between\r\nthe two layers in which muscles and connective interstitial tissue\r\nappear. In the mesoglæa of one species of coral calcification takes\r\nplace; this internal calcification has but a small share in the work of\r\nthe great rock-making corals, their most important calcification being\r\nexternal. In Monoxenia, although the transition from the gastrula larva\r\nto the adult animal has not been seen, there can be no doubt as to how\r\nthis is carried out, the transformations having been watched throughout\r\nin other species. The larva attaches itself with the end opposite the\r\nmouth, the cilia disappear, and after the mouth-tube has been formed\r\nby the folding in of the anterior end along the longitudinal axis of\r\nthe body, and has thus become marked off from the stomach, eight hollow\r\ntentacles rise round the mouth as outgrowths of the body cavity, or as\r\ndirect continuations of the stomach.\r\n\r\nLike all other corals, Monoxenia periodically multiply by means of\r\neggs, which are formed either in the walls of the radiating partitions\r\nor septa, or along the free edges. These are ejected through the oral\r\nopening. As a rule, the polyps are either male or female; but in\r\nstock-forming species individuals of the two sexes are often mixed.\r\nMonoxenia may be taken as the simplest type of the regularly radiate\r\npolyps; in all the different organs being repeated in regular rings\r\nround a central axis; the mouth also is circular. From this interesting\r\naccount, drawn by Haeckel, of a simple polyp, it will be at once seen\r\nwhat kind of radiate animal it is that builds up the coral reefs.\r\n“No garden on earth can match the gardens of the sea that circle\r\nthe northern part of Australia. As the tide ebbs in azure sunset,\r\ncoral-reefs peer out symmetrically arranged in beds and intersected by\r\nemerald pathways coursing through corals of all hues and tints fathoms\r\ndeep in the channels.”\r\n\r\nIn a growing polyp-stock the individuals usually remain in organic\r\nconnection; that is to say, each first provides for itself and then\r\nshares its superfluity with others, sometimes by means of a continuous\r\nreticulated system of canals perforating the calcareous substance which\r\noften separates the members of one stock from another. The whole colony\r\nmay thus be physiologically one creature with many mouths. There are\r\nothers that remain single, as the inverted pyramidal-looking bodies,\r\nFungidæ, commonly called “Sea-mushrooms,” found in great variety. The\r\ncolour of the polypidom is white, of a flattened round shape, made\r\nup of thin plates or scales, imbedded in a translucent jelly-like\r\nsubstance, and within is concealed a polyp; the footstalk, by means of\r\nwhich the animal is attached to the rock, is of a calcareous nature\r\n(Fig. 352, No. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.--Sea-Anemones.\r\n\r\n1. _Actinia rubra_, tentacles displayed and retracted; 2. _Heticictis\r\nbellis_; 3. _H. bellis_, seen from above.]\r\n\r\n_Hexactinia_ (six-rayed polyps) are not limited to six rays, as the\r\nname given them may seem to imply; they are, in fact, very numerous\r\nin some of the largest and most gorgeous of the sea-anemones. All are\r\ndistinguished by their solitary manner of life, their size, and their\r\nvivid and variedly beautiful colouring. The endoderm is firm, and when\r\nthe animal withdraws its tentacles and shuts its body substance in,\r\nthere is some difficulty in penetrating to the interior. It does not,\r\nhowever, secrete a calcareous skeleton inside or out, as do the true\r\ncoral polyps. Among the Hexactinia the sea-anemone (Fig. 352) takes the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nThese beautifully coloured creatures are, for the most part, found\r\nattached to the spot selected by the larvæ; a few species bore into the\r\nsand with the posterior part of the body, or build a sheath, which they\r\ninhabit. They are voracious feeders, and devour large pieces of flesh,\r\nand even mussel and oysters, sucking them in by means of their long\r\ngrasping tentacles. Well-fed anemones change their skin frequently,\r\nduring which process they remain closely retracted; the shed skin forms\r\na loose girdle around the base. _Actinia bellis_ not infrequently\r\nattach themselves to the shells of crabs and whelks, and are thus\r\ncarried to pastures new.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.--Larvæ of Sea-Anemones, _Actinia effœta_,\r\nhighly magnified.]\r\n\r\nOn account of the ease with which anemones are kept in captivity, their\r\nmode of reproduction can be closely observed. With but few exceptions\r\nthey develop from eggs, and in the course of a few weeks are hatched\r\ninto ciliated infusorial larvæ, presenting most curious and exquisite\r\nrepresentations of jugs and jars, with cover lids (as seen in Fig. 353,\r\n_Actinia effœta_). These evince the handiwork of a master hand in the\r\nceramic art. They are, however, of so translucent a nature as to permit\r\nof the internal structure being seen to consist of nerves and vessels,\r\nand which are rendered more apparent by staining. These settle down\r\nin a week or ten days, and then shed their cilia, the first tentacle\r\nappearing during the process of attachment.\r\n\r\nIn some species the young Actiniæ are seen to pass through their whole\r\ndevelopment within the body cavity of the parent. Most anemones are\r\nprovided with several circles of more or less cylindrical tentacles,\r\nand there are a few specially beautiful species which, besides\r\ntentacles of the usual form, have, either within or without the\r\nordinary circle of tentacles, lobed or leaf-like tactile and seizing\r\norgans. These belong to the family of the beautiful Crambactis of the\r\nRed Sea. Below these grasping tentacles comes a circle of thicker arms\r\nunlike the former, being spindle shaped. All the tentacles of the\r\nsea-anemones are hollow with a fine aperture at the tip, through which,\r\non closing rapidly, it is seen to expel a jet of water.\r\n\r\n_True Corals._--It will have been noticed in the foregoing remarks\r\nthat in the soft body-division of the Hexactinia there are both single\r\nindividuals and colonies joined together to form stocks. The same\r\ndiversity in this respect will be found among corals proper, with this\r\ndifference, that the skeleton-forming polyps, by combining, build up\r\nsubstantial structures in the most secure and advantageous positions.\r\nNow it so happens that all the corals found about our coasts are\r\ngenerally small and solitary dwellers, one of the best known of which\r\nis the scarlet crisp coral, Flabellum, and is characterised by the\r\nslit-like form of the mouth. Viewed sideways it resembles a small fan\r\nfastened along the edges, and just inside a row of fully developed\r\ntentacles is seen protruding. An interesting form of budding occurs\r\nin these corals: the buds fall off, and in this budding condition the\r\ncoral might pass, and indeed has been described as a different species\r\nof Flabellum. The colour of the coral is a beautifully transparent\r\nred. Remarkable as the solitary corals are, they are surpassed both in\r\nnumber and in form by those which form compound stocks, that is to say,\r\nin which the buds do not fall off, but go on building up coral islands\r\nand barrier reefs in the warmer seas. Some very few typical forms only\r\nare given in the group accompanying, shown in Fig. 358.\r\n\r\nA different kind of stock is developed in a number of forms, some\r\nproducing many buds, as in the Madrepores, in which selected polyps\r\nspring up above the rest, their sides also becoming covered with small\r\nbuds, each one of which is a living, feeding, coral animal surrounded\r\nby a crown of tentacles. These Madrepores play a very important part in\r\nthe building up of coral reefs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354. Developmental stages of Larvæ, _Astroides\r\ncalycularis_, × 40.]\r\n\r\nAnother massive coral, the _Astroides calycularis_, has a different\r\nmode of growth, the tubes not being fused together. When seen standing\r\nout these yellowish-red polyps have been mistaken for small anemones.\r\nThe larvæ of this coral leave the egg while still in the large\r\nchambered body cavity of the parent, where they swim about for a time,\r\ntill they escape through the mouth. They are worm-like in form, and\r\nswim by means of cilia, which are thicker at the foremost end. The\r\nmouth first appears after leaving the parent, but as they soon become\r\nexhausted by the effort they assume a contracted form, and attach\r\nthemselves, as do anemones, by pressing the thicker end of the body\r\nagainst a rock, the whole contracting into a thick round disc, while\r\nlongitudinal furrows become visible at the upper part where the mouth\r\nsinks in. At the end of these furrows twelve tentacles appear. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows the various stages through which the\r\nlarvæ pass in rapid succession (Fig. 354); at the same time it has\r\nalready commenced to secrete its calcareous skeleton. This is not\r\nformed as a connected whole but from a number of separate centres\r\nof secretion formed between the polyp and the substance to which it\r\nhas attached itself, and which become gradually fused into a perfect\r\nskeleton. A section of the polyp at this stage forms an interesting\r\nmicroscopical object.\r\n\r\nThe so-called eight-rayed corals consist of the one genus Tubipora, the\r\nmembers of which are few in number and not varied in form (Fig. 358,\r\nNo. 10). In the structure, however, of skeletons they are unique among\r\nextant corals. Each individual secretes a smooth-walled tube without\r\ncalcification of the vertical septa. These tubes, like the pipes of an\r\norgan, stand almost parallel, and are united to form a stock by means\r\nof transverse platforms. The formation of buds does not appear to take\r\nplace in this family.\r\n\r\nAnother of the eight-rayed corals is Gorgoniidæ. These are permanently\r\nfixed to the spot on which they are found, and form a bush-like growth,\r\ngiving no idea of the living coral, as it rises in graceful branching\r\ncolonies, in deep water, and represents a portion of _Gorgonia nobilis_\r\nwith polyps expanded (Figs. 344 and 358, No. 9).\r\n\r\nOther corals present numerous other departures from the types we have\r\nbeen considering, but so far modified in form as that of the Sea-pen,\r\nVeretillum (Fig. 355), the stock part of which is surrounded by polyps\r\ncontinued down a portion of the cylindrical stalk. The best known of\r\nthe species is _Pennatula phosphorea_ of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.\r\n\r\n1. _Pennatula phosphorea_; 2. _Synapta chirodata_; 3. Anchor-shaped\r\nspiculum and plate from the ectoderm of same.]\r\n\r\n_Pennatulidæ._--This family derives its name from _penna_, a quill.\r\nTheir spicula also resemble a penholder in appearance, shown in\r\nFig. 358, No. 3. The polyps are without colour, provided with eight\r\nrather long retractile tentacula, beautifully ciliated on the inner\r\naspect with two series of short processes, and strengthened by these\r\ncrystalline spicula, a row being carried up the stalk, together with a\r\nseries of ciliated processes. The mouth, occupying the centre of the\r\ntentacula, is somewhat angular. The ova lie between the membranous\r\npart of the pinnæ; these are globular, of a yellowish colour, and by\r\npressure can be made to pass through the mouth. Dr. Grant wrote:--“A\r\nmore singular and beautiful spectacle could scarcely be conceived than\r\nthat of a deep purple _Pennatula phosphorea_, with all its delicate\r\ntransparent polyps expanded and emitting their usual brilliant\r\nphosphorescent light, sailing through the still and dark abyss, by the\r\nregular and synchronous pulsations of the minute fringed arms of the\r\npolyps.”\r\n\r\nThe spicula are seen to be a continuous series of cones fitting into\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryozoa, Moss-animals.\r\n\r\nThe exact position in which the Bryozoa, or moss-animals, should be\r\nplaced in the animal kingdom has not been finally determined. They were\r\nat one time associated with corals; then with sponges; but, on further\r\nacquaintance, it became evident that they did not belong to either.\r\nNaturalists also claimed them as Rotifers and Ciliata, but this claim\r\nmet with no better reception. Since they appear to have no settled\r\nclassification, there can be no objection to linking them once more to\r\ncorals, as they apparently resemble these animals by always living in\r\ncolonies, the individual members of which are joined in a number of\r\ndifferent ways to form stocks, the individuals themselves, however,\r\nbeing very much smaller than those of corals proper. The advantage is\r\nthat the structure of the Bryozoans can be more readily studied, as\r\nmany of them live in transparent chambers or cells, the walls of which,\r\nalthough somewhat firmly agglutinated together, are flexible enough to\r\nfold up, as the animals instantly withdraw their bodies and close up\r\nthe top on the slightest alarm (Fig. 356).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.--Paludicella, tentacles expanded and cell\r\nclosed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.--Sea-moss, Flustra, the body having been\r\nwithdrawn from its cell.]\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the Bryozoan individual, figured attached\r\nby its footstalk to a stem of wood, consists of a mouth at the\r\nanterior part of the body opening into a muscular pharynx in the\r\nalimentary canal, together occupying a considerable amount of space.\r\nThe terminal portion turns upon itself towards the oral opening, its\r\nchief attachment being a short strand of tissue termed the funiculus\r\n(shown in Fig. 358, No. 11). In all adults two masses of cells are\r\nfound attached to the wall of the chamber; the upper yields the\r\neggs, within the lower the male elements are developed. Moss-animals\r\nare hermaphrodite, fertilisation being effected by the two elements\r\nmingling together in the body fluid. These are the essential points\r\nin the structure of the whole seventeen hundred species. Among the\r\nlarger colonies a number of fresh-water genera are found attached to\r\nthe roots and branches of aquatic plants, most of which, however, are\r\ninconspicuous. The beauty of these minute bodies can only be seen\r\nunder the microscope. Many consist of delicate branching growths, the\r\nSea-mats (Flustra), for instance; others again appear as attractive\r\nlace corals, between the open meshes of which multitudes of minute\r\napertures crowned with tentacles are displayed. The several individuals\r\nof the genus Lepralia are arranged in rows, and further distinguished\r\nby the animals being developed only on one side of the stock. The\r\nmarvellous variety of forms presented by these small animals is in\r\na measure determined by the particular manner of their buddings.\r\nThe greater number of fresh-water moss-animals belong to the order\r\nPhylactolæmata, so called because the mouth is provided with a\r\ntongue-shaped lid. The crown of tentacles is furnished with rows of\r\ncilia, and is horseshoe-shaped, the whole being surrounded at its base\r\nby an integument forming a kind of cup, which is either soft or horny.\r\nThose belonging to the wandering types (Cristatella, Plate IV., Nos.\r\n95-98) form flattened elliptical colonies, some of which creep or move\r\nabout on a kind of foot. A nervous system pervades the mass of polyps,\r\nwhile in each separate polyp a nerve ganglion is seen to be situated\r\nbetween the œsophagus and the posterior part of the alimentary canal.\r\nThe colony nerve system regulates the movements of the stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.--Typical forms of Corals.\r\n\r\n1. _Fungia agariciformis_; 2.

A tentacle detached and magnified 200\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\nThere are many beautifully formed freshwater polyps deserving of more\r\nthan a passing notice, as the slender Coryne (_Coryne stauridia_),\r\nfound adhering to the footstalk of a _Rhodymenia_ (Fig. 359), about\r\nwhich it creeps in the form of a white thread. On placing both under\r\nthe microscope, the thread-like body of the little animal appears\r\ncylindrical and tubular, perfectly transparent, and permeated by a\r\ncentral core, apparently cellular in texture, hollow, and within which\r\na rather slow circulation of globules is perceived. The parent Coryne\r\nsends off numerous branches, the terminal head of which is oblong,\r\ncylindrical, and at the extreme end there are arranged four tentacles,\r\nlong and slender, each being furnished with a nodular head. A magnified\r\nview of one detached is shown erect (Fig. 359, No. 2). This polyp\r\nis much infested by parasites, vorticella growing on it in immense\r\nnumbers, forming aggregated clusters here and there, individuals of the\r\nparasitic colony adhering to each other, and projecting outwards in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nAlcyonella, another fresh-water polyp, is found in the autumn of the\r\nyear in all the London Docks adhering to pieces of floating timber. _A.\r\nstagnorum_ partakes of the character of a sponge rather than that of a\r\npolyp. It is usually found in gelatinous colonies, and when stood aside\r\nfor a short time these put forth a number of ciliated tentacles (shown\r\nin Fig. 360, magnified 100 diameters).\r\n\r\nThe ova contained within the sac, and viewed by transmitted light,\r\nappear as opaque spheres surrounded by a thin transparent margin; these\r\nincrease in thickness as the ova is developed, and such of the ova as\r\nlie in contact seem to unite and form a statoblast. A rapid current\r\nin the water around each animal, drawing with it loose particles and\r\nfloating animalcules, is seen moving with some velocity as in other\r\nciliated bodies; and a zone of very minute vibrating cilia surrounds\r\nthe transparent margin of each tentacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.--_Alcyonella fluviatella._]\r\n\r\nDr. Percival Wright discovered on the western coast of Ireland a new\r\ngenus of Alcyonidæ, which he named after the well-known naturalist\r\nHarte, _Hartea elegans_ (Plate IV., No. 86). This polyp is solitary,\r\nthe body cylindrical, and fixed by its base to the rock; it has eight\r\nciliated tentacles, which are knobbed at their base and most freely\r\ndisplayed. It is a very beautiful polyzoon of a clear white colour, and\r\nwhen fully expanded stands three-quarters of an inch high.\r\n\r\n_Lophopus crystallinus_ (Plate IV., No. 98) displays beautiful plumes\r\nof tentacles arranged in a double horseshoe-shaped series. When\r\nfirst observed these polyps resemble in many respects masses of the\r\nwater snail ova, for which they are often mistaken. On placing these\r\njelly-like masses into a glass trough with some of the clear water\r\ntaken from the stream in which they are found, delicate tubes are\r\nseen to cautiously protrude, and the beautiful fringes of cilia are\r\nquickly brought into play. The organisation of _L. crystallinus_ is\r\nsimple, although it is provided with organs of digestion, circulation,\r\nrespiration, and generation. The nervous[70] and muscular systems are\r\nwell developed. This polyp increases both by budding and by ova,\r\nboth of which conditions are shown in Plate IV., No. 98. The ova are\r\nenclosed in the transparent case of the parent. In Lophopus and some\r\nother fresh-water genera, Cristatella, Plumatella, and Alcyonella, the\r\nneural margin of the Lophopore is extended into two triangular arms,\r\ngiving it the appearance of a deep crescent.\r\n\r\nAnother family presents a contrast: there is no lid to the mouth, and\r\nthe tentacles are arranged in a circle on a disc. An important rise in\r\norganisation is found in the Gymnolæmata, especially in the lip-mouthed\r\nforms; the individuals belonging to this order vary in structure and\r\nfulfil different physiological functions. There are structures known\r\nas zoæcia, stolons, avicularia, vibracula, and ovicells, some of which\r\nare merely modified individuals. The zoæcia are the normal individuals\r\nof the colony, fully developed for most of the functions of life; the\r\nstolons have a much humbler function, but are indispensable--they\r\nare the root-like outgrowths of the stock, and serve for attaching\r\nthe colony to foreign objects. The most remarkable are those known\r\nas _avicularia_, so called because they resemble the head of a bird.\r\nThis process acts as a pair of forceps, the large upper blade of\r\nwhich is very like the skull and upper jaw of a bird, and the smaller\r\nlower blade (like the lower jaw) constantly opens and shuts by means\r\nof a complicated arrangement of muscles (shown in Fig. 361). These\r\navicularia are movably attached by short muscles to the neck, and are\r\nfound near the entrance to a zoæcium. They turn from side to side,\r\nsnapping in all directions, catching at every particle of food that may\r\ncome near; at length the morsel is drawn into the mouth by the cilia\r\non the tentacles. From this very peculiar structure the Chilostomata\r\nwere originally named bird’s-head corallines, then specifically\r\nshepherd’s-purse corallines, _Notamia bursaria_. Equally interesting,\r\nagain, are the _vibracula_, long thread-like structures, attached by\r\nshort footstalks. These keep up a constant whip-like motion, the object\r\nof which is not quite clear. The ovicells, or egg receptacles, are\r\nfound at the lower ends of the zoæcia in the form of shields, helmets,\r\nor vesicles. In Plate IV., Nos. 95 and 96, a front and edge view of the\r\nstatoblast is shown highly magnified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.\r\n\r\n1. _Notamia bursaria_, shepherd’s-purse Bryozoa; 2. Polyp magnified and\r\nwithdrawn into its cell; 3. Portion of a colony of Hydroid polyps.]\r\n\r\nAnother sub-order consists of the Cyclostomata, or round-mouthed\r\nBryozoans, of which the Tubulipora is the typical form. The stocks are\r\ncup-shaped incrustations, the individuals radiating outwards, as in\r\nPlate IV., No. 92. _Tubularia dumortierii_ is a very interesting form,\r\nthe germinal bodies, statoblasts, being formed as cell masses on the\r\nstrand, or funiculus, which also maintains the stomach in its place.\r\nThey are round or oval in shape, and brown or yellow in colour, and\r\nconsist of two valves fitted one upon the other like watch glasses, as\r\nshown in No. 96. A number of other statoblasts are shown, Nos. 97, 98,\r\nand 99. The edge running round No. 95 is seen to have barbed tips; the\r\nring itself contains small air chambers, and is termed the swimming\r\nbelt. It is, in fact, a perfect hydrostatic apparatus, giving support\r\nto the winter buds or statoblasts on the surface of the water. The\r\nbarbed hooks apparently act as anchors, and by their means they catch\r\non at points suitable for their development during the coming spring.\r\nAs soon as the time comes, the two halves split apart and the germinal\r\nmass emerges forth. Out of these winter buds and statoblasts asexually\r\nproduced individuals arise, which reproduce themselves sexually, their\r\ndescendants again yielding winter germs. In short, an alternation of\r\ngenerations is a continually recurring process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.--_Lingula pyramidata._]\r\n\r\n_Brachiopoda._--Here again we have to do with an enigmatical class\r\nof arm-footed animals, of which the Lamp-shells may be regarded as\r\ntypical. These have remained unaltered from the earliest geological\r\nepochs. Brachiopods are divided into two orders: those having shells\r\nwithout hinges, and those with shells hinged together. On the whole\r\nthey possess less interest for the microscopists than many other\r\nanimals, except in their earliest developmental stages of existence.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the hinge-class group, living chiefly\r\nnear the shores of the warmer seas, is the Lingulidæ. The valves\r\nare almost exactly similar, but are not hinged together, and have\r\nno processes for the support of the thick fleshy spiral arms of the\r\nanimals. In _L. pyramidata_, found around the Philippine Islands (Fig.\r\n362), the stalk is nine times longer than the body. The animal does not\r\nattach itself by this, but moves about like a worm, making tubes out\r\nof sand, into which it can withdraw itself and disappear. The cilia at\r\nthe mantle edge form a fine sieve, thus preventing foreign particles\r\nfrom entering the gills. Its internal structure possesses points\r\nof interest, and the parasitic growths covering the cartilaginous\r\nstructure, miscalled a shell, are curious, and excite the attention of\r\nthe naturalist.\r\n\r\nAnother bivalve so unlike a crustacean, among which it has been\r\nplaced, I may venture to describe among Lamp-shells. I refer to the\r\nbarnacle (Lepas) generally met with covering the bottoms of ships.\r\nThese, as in the former genus, are more interesting to the microscopist\r\nin the early stage of existence, and also for the curious parasites\r\nknown to infest them. The barnacle protrudes through its two valves\r\nsix pairs of slender, bristly, two-branched filamentous limbs, which\r\nkeep up a constant sweeping motion, and whereby it secures its supply\r\nof food (Fig. 363). When first hatched the young are in the Nauplius\r\nstage, being furnished with a median eye and three pairs of flagellated\r\nappendages. After enjoying a free life the larva moults and passes into\r\na second stage, in which with its two eyes and compressed carapace\r\n(shown in Fig. 364) it so nearly resembles a Daphnia. Before these\r\nthoracic appendages entirely disappear they first change places, and\r\nthen each is seen to be provided with a sucker; by this means the larva\r\nfixes itself to its permanent resting-place, while a cement gland\r\npours out a secretion that glues it firmly to the point of attachment\r\nchosen. These Cirripedes are not true parasites, inasmuch as they do\r\nnot extract nourishment from the body to which they are attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.\r\n\r\n1. Spat of oyster, some ciliated; 2. Barnacles attached by footstalks.]\r\n\r\nOne species, the Proteolepas, is in the adult stage a maggot-like,\r\nlimbless, shell-less animal found living within the mantle chamber\r\nof other members of the same order, while the root-headed Cirripedes\r\n(_Peltogaster curvatus_, as Fig. 364, No. 1) live parasitically upon\r\nhigher crustaceans.\r\n\r\n_Echinodermata._--This sub-kingdom includes the star-fishes,\r\nstone-lilies, sea-urchins, feather-stars, and sea-cucumbers, some\r\nof which have been already alluded to, and are so well known that\r\nthey need no lengthy description, while of the fossil sea-urchins of\r\nour chalk formations, the Pentremites and Crinoids, whose silicious\r\nremains are so abundant and so familiar to naturalists and geologists,\r\nbut little remains to be said. They are chiefly interesting to the\r\nmicroscopist from their calcareous and silicious appendages, known as\r\nspicula. In the sea-urchin, brittle-star, or feather-star, the outer\r\nbody surface consists almost wholly of a deposit of calcium carbonate,\r\ncombined in the form of little plates built up into a rigid “test,”\r\nwhereas in the star-fish it usually forms a kind of scaffolding,\r\nbetween the layers of which there stretches a firm leathery skin. Among\r\nthe sea-cucumbers, the living specimens of which present extraordinary\r\nvariations both in form and character, the deposit consists chiefly\r\nof small spicules which grate when the skin is cut with a knife. If a\r\nthin section of the skin is examined under the microscope, the spicules\r\nare seen to be profusely distributed in the middle layer. The\r\nsame deposit takes place in the stalked column of a crinoid and in\r\nsea-urchins (Echinodermata), which has tended to preserve them in the\r\nfossilised state. Fig. 365 is selected as exhibiting to perfection the\r\nMedusa-headed Pentacrinoid. This echinoderm differs in two characters:\r\nfirst, its microscopic structure is that of a meshwork deposited in\r\nthe spaces of a network of soft tissue; secondly, that each element,\r\nwhether a spicule or a plate, is, despite its trellised structure,\r\ndeposited around regular lines of crystallisation (shown in Plate IV.,\r\nNos. 89 and 90). Owing to these characteristics the minutest portion\r\nof an echinoderm skeleton is readily recognised, even when fossilised,\r\nunder the microscope. Even the species of the sea-cucumber can be\r\ndetermined by the shape of their spicules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364.--Parasitic Barnacles.\r\n\r\n1. _Peltogaster curvatus_; 2. Nauplius larva of Parthenopea; × 200.]\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable feature in the radiate structure is that in many\r\ncases it gives to the animal a star-shape, to which the names of\r\nstar-fish and brittle-star are given (see Plate IV., No. 91, and\r\nPlate XVII., _f_ and _n_). The ordinary five-rayed star-fish is found\r\neverywhere around the English coasts. This constant arrangement of\r\norgans holds good in the majority of the echinoderms; it can be\r\ndetected in the Holothurians, where, beside the feathery tentacles of\r\nthe head, rows of shorter sucker-like processes will be found, which in\r\nsome instances extend the whole length of the body, the fixed number of\r\nrows being also five in their internal organs. Hence these animals were\r\nformerly grouped under Radiata. But if a sea-cucumber or sea-urchin\r\nbe dissected, a marked distinction will be found between them, in one\r\nportion of the organism in particular: the intestine is shut off from\r\nthe rest of the body-cavity, often coiling round inside. Examine a\r\nstar-fish or sea-urchin on the under-surface of the rays, and, passing\r\nin five bands from top to bottom, a number of small cylindrical\r\nprocesses are seen gently waving about; these lie in two rows with a\r\nclear space between them, and are termed in consequence _ambulacrum_.\r\nThey end in sucker-like discs, which enable the animal to attach\r\nitself, or pull itself against strong currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.--Medusa-headed Pentacrinoid.\r\n\r\n_a._ Crown and part of stem; _b._ Upper surface of body, the arms\r\nbroken away, showing the food grooves passing to the central\r\nmouth.--(Warne.)]\r\n\r\nJust one other special feature should be noticed: radial canals pass\r\nalong under the ambulacra, and join a ring-canal around the mouth, well\r\nsupplied by nerve cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366.\r\n\r\n1. Transverse section of a branch of Myriapore; 2, and the others]\r\nSection of the stem of _Virgularia mirabilis_; 3, Spiculum from\r\nthe outer surface of Sea-pen; 4, Spicula from _Isis hippuris_; 5,\r\nfrom _Gorgonia elongata_; 6, from Alcyonium; 7, and from _Gorgonia\r\numbraculum_; 8, Calcareous remains of a Crinoid.]\r\n\r\n_Crinoids_ (stone-lilies), on the other hand, are formed of a series\r\nof flat rings, pierced through by a narrow canal. The ossicles, as\r\nthey are termed, are joined by ligaments passing through their solid\r\nsubstance and endowed with muscular power; the central part serves for\r\nthe passage of blood-vessels, and is surrounded by a sheath of nervous\r\ntissue that controls the movements of the stem, the latter being\r\nencrusted by a number of fine rootlets. The stems possess a limited\r\npower of bending. In the words of Professor Agassiz, “The stem itself\r\npasses slowly from a rigid vertical attitude to a curved or even a\r\ndrooping position; the cirri move more rapidly than the arms, and the\r\nanimal uses them as hooks to catch hold of objects, and on account of\r\ntheir sharp extremities they are well adapted to retain their hold of\r\nprey.” The rosy-feather star-fish is often found clinging to a tube\r\nof the Sabella worm; the food of crinoids consists of foraminifera,\r\ndiatoms, and the larvæ of crustaceans. There are so many curious\r\nfeatures in connection with the Echinodermata that my readers may with\r\nadvantage consult “The _Challenger_ Reports” and Warne’s “Natural\r\nHistory” on other points of interest.\r\n\r\n_Holothuroidea_ (sea-cucumbers) are elongated slug-like creatures,\r\nthe skin being in structure similar to that of the slug, with a\r\ncomparatively small amount of calcareous matter. Usually this occurs\r\nin small spicules, which assume very definite shapes, as the anchors\r\nof Synapta (Plate IV., No. 87, and in Fig. 355). There are also rings\r\nof calcareous plates around the gullet, five of which have the same\r\nrelation to the radial water-vessels as the auricles round the jaws of\r\na sea-urchin, and which likewise serve for the attachment of muscles.\r\nThese plates are seen in Plate VIII., Nos. 171 and 172, as they appear\r\ncoloured by selenite films under polarised light. Around the mouth\r\nin Cucumaria is a fringe of branched tentacles connected with the\r\nwater-vascular ring; these appear to be used as a net to intercept\r\nfloating organisms.\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the star-fishes is a small family based on the\r\ncharacter of their pincer-like organs, called pedicellariæ, on the\r\nsurface of the test (shown in Plate IV., Nos. 93 and 94, magnified ×\r\n25). Movable spines cover the surface of these echinoderms, varying\r\nin size from minute bristle-like structures to long rods. The\r\npedicellariæ are, it is believed, derived from the smaller spines,\r\nand two of them are united at the base by muscles, slightly curved,\r\nand made to approach each other at their extremities. There is a\r\ngradual modification of this type through the whole series. Many uses\r\nhave been assigned to them, as the holding of food, as they have been\r\nseen to hold to the fronds of seaweed and keep them steady until the\r\nspines and tube feet can be brought into action. The inner surface of\r\nthe pedicellariæ are known to be the most sensitive, and the blades\r\nclose on the minutest object touching the inner surface. Beside these\r\npeculiar bodies the surface of the skin has small tubular processes,\r\nand tubular feet with suckers at the end. At the extremity of each arm\r\nis a single tube-foot with an impaired tentacle, and above this again\r\nis a small eye coloured by red pigment.\r\n\r\nPassing by many other points of interest in the Echinoidæ, the spines\r\nare seen to be attached to the test or shell by a ball and socket joint\r\nand well-arranged muscles, whereby the spines can be moved in any\r\ndirection. The tubercles, however, do not cover the whole test, but\r\nare disposed chiefly in five broad zones extending from one pole to\r\nanother. When a transverse section of a spine is examined by a medium\r\npower it is seen to be made up of a series of concentric and radiating\r\nlayers (shown in Plate XVIII., Nos. 1 and 2), the centre being occupied\r\nby reticulated structure and structureless spots arranged at equal\r\ndistances; these may be termed ribs or pillars. Passing towards the\r\nmargin are other rows conveying the impression of a beautiful indented\r\nreticulated tissue. Many of the spines present no structure, while\r\nothers exhibit a series of concentric rings of successive growth,\r\nwhich strongly remind one of the medullary rays of plants. When a\r\nvertical section of a spine is submitted to examination, it is seen to\r\nbe composed of cones placed one above the other, the outer margin of\r\neach cone being formed by the series of pillars. In certain species of\r\nEchinus the number of cones is very considerable, while in others there\r\nare seldom more than one or two to be found; from these, transverse\r\nsections may when made show no concentric rings, only the external row\r\nof pillars.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of echinoderms contains but a small amount of organic\r\nmatter, as will be seen on dissolving out the calcareous portion in\r\ndilute nitric or hydrochloric acids. The residuum structure will\r\nappear to be meshes or areolæ, bounded by a substance having a fibrous\r\nappearance, intermingled with granulous matter; in fact, it bears a\r\nclose resemblance to the areolar tissue of higher animals, and the test\r\nmay be considered as formed, not by the consolidation of the cells\r\nof the ectoderm, as in the mollusc, but by the calcification of the\r\nfibro-areolar tissue of the endoderm. This calcification of a simple\r\nfibrous tissue by the deposit of a mineral substance, not in the meshes\r\nof areolæ but in intimate union with the organic basis, is a condition\r\nof much interest to the physiologist; it presents an example of a\r\nprocess which seems to have an important share in the formation and\r\ngrowth of bone, namely, in the progressive calcification of the fibrous\r\ntissue of the periosteum membrane covering of the bone.\r\n\r\nThe development of the sea-urchin from the fertilised egg first divides\r\nand then sub-divides, and in a short time the embryo issues forth\r\nwith a small tuft of cilia, by means of which it swims off freely.\r\nThe larvæ, in its full development, measures about one millimetre in\r\ndiameter, and is a curious and remarkable creature.\r\n\r\n=The sub-kingdom Mollusca= comprises some fifty thousand species, and\r\nfresh forms are being constantly discovered, the number of the aquatic\r\ngenera being more than double that of the terrestrial species, for\r\nit matters not to what depth of ocean the dredge is let down, some\r\nnew form is certain to be gathered. The _Challenger_ expedition has\r\nenriched our knowledge of the deep-sea fauna to an enormous extent; so\r\nmuch so, that fifty volumes have already been published descriptive\r\nof animals brought to the surface. Nevertheless, we are told that\r\nthe great coast lines of South America, Africa, Asia, and parts of\r\nAustralia have been but imperfectly explored for smaller kinds of\r\nMollusca.\r\n\r\nMolluscs are soft-bodied, cold-blooded animals, without any internal\r\nskeleton, but this is compensated for by the external hardened shell,\r\nwhich at once serves the purpose of bones, and is a means of defence.\r\nThese bodies are not divided into segments like those of worms and\r\ninsects, but are enveloped in a muscular covering or skin, termed\r\nthe mantle, the special function of which in most species is the\r\nformation and secretion of the shell. The foot, which serves the\r\ndouble purpose of locomotion and burrowing in the sand or rock, is an\r\norgan particularly characteristic of most molluscs. There are many\r\ndepartures from this rule, as, for instance, in the group Chitonidæ,\r\nwhere the shell takes the form of a series of eight adjacent plates;\r\nand in another, the Pholadidæ, there are one or more accessory pieces\r\nin addition to the two principal valves. Some are bivalved, others\r\nunivalved, and concealed beneath the skin. All shells are mainly\r\ncomposed of carbonate of lime, with a small admixture of animal\r\nmatter. Their microscopic examination reveals a great diversity of\r\nstructure, as we shall presently see, and they are accordingly termed\r\nporcellaneous, nacreous, glassy, horny, and fibrous. Most molluscs\r\nhave the power of repairing injuries to their shells; many exhibit an\r\nouter coat of animal matter, termed the _peristracum_, the special\r\nfunction of which is to preserve the shell from atmospheric and\r\nchemical action of the carbonic acid in the water in which they dwell.\r\n\r\nThe shells of gastropods are enlarged with the growth of the mollusc\r\nby the addition of fresh layers to the margin. In some species the\r\nperiodic formation of spines occurs; a typical case will be found among\r\nMuricidæ. The varied colours of shells are due to glands situated on\r\nthe margin of the mantle, and beneath the peristracum; occasionally\r\nthe inner layer of porcellaneous shells is of a different colour to\r\nthe outer, as, for example, in the helmet-shells (Cassis), much used\r\nby carvers of shell cameos. Light and warmth, as in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, are the great factors in the production of brilliant colours.\r\nIn cold climates land snails bury themselves in winter time in the\r\nground or beneath decaying vegetable matter, and in hot seasons they\r\nclose up the aperture of the shells with a temporary lid, called an\r\n_epiphragm_. These exhibit great tenacity of life, as, for instance,\r\nin the Egyptian desert-snail, _Helix desertorum_. The reproductive\r\nsystem is in all cases effected by means of eggs. The ova are usually\r\nenclosed in capsules, and deposited in masses, and the number of eggs\r\ncontained in the squid and the whelk have been stated to be thirty or\r\nforty thousand. The ova of molluscs may be gradually developed into\r\nthe adult, or there may be a free-swimming ciliated larval stage, or a\r\nspecial larval form, as in the fresh-water mussel. Most are provided\r\nwith a more or less distinct head; both cephalopods and gastropods\r\nare furnished with eyes. In land snails these are found placed on\r\nprojecting stalks. In most cases the utility of molluscs far outweighs\r\nthe injury occasioned by a few species, as, for instance, the Teredo,\r\nand the burrowing habits of the Pholas and Saxicava, compact marble\r\nhaving been found bored through by them.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Robertson wrote me in 1866:--“Having, while residing here\r\n(Brighton), opportunities of studying the _Pholas dactylus_, I\r\nhave endeavoured during the last six months to discover how this\r\nmollusc makes its hole or crypt in the chalk--by a chemical solvent?\r\nby absorption? by ciliary currents? or by rotatory motions? My\r\nobservations, dissections, and experiments set at rest controversy\r\non this point. Between twenty and thirty of these creatures have been\r\nat work in lumps of chalk in sea water in a finger glass and a pan,\r\nat my window for the last three months. The _Pholas dactylus_ makes\r\nits hole by grating the chalk with its rasp-like valves, licking it up\r\nwhen pulverised with its foot, forcing it up through its principal or\r\nbranchial siphon, and squirting it out in oblong nodules. The crypt\r\nprotects the Pholas from Conferveæ, often found growing parasitically\r\nnot only outside the shell but even within the lips of the valves, thus\r\npreventing the action of the siphons. In the foot there is a spring,\r\nor style, which when removed is found to possess great elasticity, and\r\nthis seems to be the mainspring of the motion of the Pholas.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.--Hexabranchus.]\r\n\r\nI must pass by many groups and orders to more aberrant types,\r\nrepresented by the naked-gilled orders, Opisthobranchiata and\r\nNudibranchiata. These gastropods constitute a large sub-order of\r\nextremely beautiful molluscs, remarkable in shape, and often brilliant\r\nin colour. The distinguishing character of these typical forms consists\r\nin the peculiar nature and situation of their breathing organs, which\r\nare exposed on the back of the animal or around the anterior part, and\r\nare not protected by the mantle. But the situation is varied, and the\r\ngills are sometimes placed on each side of the body, respiration being\r\neffected by the ciliated surface of the whole. For these and other\r\nreasons they have been placed in four groups. Nudibranchs are found\r\nin all parts of the world, and are most abundant in depths where the\r\nchoicest seaweeds and corallines abound. Their fecundity is very great,\r\nas many as sixty thousand eggs being deposited by a single female at\r\none time. They are eaten as a luxury where they most abound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.--Longitudinal section of _Pleurobranchus\r\naurantiacus_, showing circulation and gills or branchiæ.--(Warne.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Opisthobranchs the branched veins as well as the auricle are\r\nplaced behind the ventricle of the heart. They differ from Nudibranchs\r\ninasmuch as they are usually furnished with a pair of tentacles and\r\nlabial palpi, or an expansion of the skin like the veil of the larval\r\nform. To clearly understand the character of the internal organisation\r\nof these curious animals, the longitudinal section given in Fig. 368\r\nmust be consulted: _p_ is the foot; _a_ the mouth, covered above\r\nwith the veil-like expansion, over which are the tentacles, _c_; the\r\nbranchial veins, _v_, carry the blood to the gills, from which it flows\r\ninto the heart at _h_. This disposition is the opposite of that which\r\ncharacterises the Prosobranchus. Another anatomical peculiarity, which\r\nmay here be referred to, is the direct communication of the system of\r\nblood vessels with the surrounding medium; a characteristic common\r\nto most other molluscs, and on which depends the changeable external\r\nappearance of the animal. In the illustration of Pleurobranchus here\r\ngiven, _g_ indicates the opening of the duct which conveys water direct\r\nto the blood, and through which the blood vessels permeate the back and\r\nfoot. Like the holes in the sponges, it can be filled or emptied at the\r\nwill of the animal.\r\n\r\nAlthough this, in the main, is the principle of the circulation in\r\nmost of this order, one branch possesses no special breathing organs,\r\nrespiration being carried on throughout the naked skin of the body.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Nudibranchiata, the group having the most\r\nsymmetrical form is the extensive family Dorididæ, characterised by\r\ndifferences in the branchiæ, the relative proportion of the mantle to\r\nthe foot, and variations in the radula and jaws. The general aspect of\r\nthe genus Doris, although drawn on a small scale, is represented in\r\nPlate XVII., Fig. _b_. The whole sub-order of Nudibranchs has become\r\nmore generally known and admired since the publication of Alder and\r\nHancock’s monograph with its many attractive coloured illustrations.\r\n\r\nThese gastropods can be kept alive for some time in a small aquarium\r\nif the precaution is observed of often changing the water and adding a\r\nlittle fresh seaweed. Numerous curious microscopic forms of life may be\r\nfound adhering to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.--_Aplysia dipilans._]\r\n\r\n_Tunicata._--The most remarkable group of animals belonging to this\r\nsub-order are the Ascidians. They derive their name from the test or\r\ntunic, a membranous consistence, in which they dwell, and which often\r\nincludes calcareous spicules. The test has two orifices, within which\r\nis the mantle. Few microscopic spectacles are more interesting than the\r\ncirculation along this network of muslin-like fabric, and that of the\r\nciliary movement by which the fluid is kept moving. In the transparent\r\nspecies, as Clavelina and Perophora, the ciliary movement is seen to\r\ngreater advantage. The animals are found adhering to the broad fronds\r\nof fuci near low water-mark. They thrive in tanks, and multiply both\r\nby fission and budding. Two species are figured in Plate XVII., Figs.\r\n_i_ and _k_, the zooids of which were found arranged in clusters, as\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n_Aplysiidæ_ (sea-hares), so called on account of a slight resemblance\r\nto a crouching hare. The body form is elongated with a partially\r\ndeveloped neck and head, oral and dorsal tentacles, and furnished\r\nbeneath the mantle with a shelly plate to protect the branchiæ. The\r\nmouth is provided with horny jaws, and the gizzard is armed with\r\nspines, to prepare the food for digestion. The side lobes are thin and\r\nlarge, and are either folded over the back or used in swimming. Fig.\r\n369 is a reduced drawing of _A. dipilans._\r\n\r\nThe Pectinibranchs are known as violet sea-snails, Ianthinidæ and\r\nScalariidæ. The radula consists of numerous rows of pointed teeth\r\narranged in cross series, forming an angle in the middle. There is\r\nno central or rachidian tooth, and they have thin trochiform shells\r\nadapted for a pelagic life. They are mostly of a violet colour, from\r\nwhich they derive their name, the colour being more vivid on the\r\nunderside, which is turned up towards the light when the animal is\r\nswimming near the surface of the sea (Fig. 370).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.--Ianthinia, Violet Sea-snail.--(Warne.)\r\n\r\nThe bubble _b_, drawn somewhat too large, is about to be joined to the\r\nanterior end of the float; _c._ Shell; _l._ Float; _p._ Foot; _t._\r\nHead.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature in connection with these oceanic\r\nsnails is the curious float which they construct to support their\r\negg-capsules. It is a gelatinous raft, in fact, enclosing air-bubbles,\r\nwhich is attached to the foot, the egg capsules being suspended from\r\nits under-surface. They are unable to sink so long as they are in\r\nconnection with their floats, and are therefore often cast on shore\r\nduring storms, and furnish an endless series of microscopic specimens.\r\nThe violet snails feed on various kinds of jelly-fish, and occur in\r\nshoals.\r\n\r\n_Pond Snails._--The three families, Limnœidæ, Physidæ, and Chilinidæ,\r\nform a special group of the pulminate, sessile-eyed fresh-water snails.\r\nThe larger family of these belongs to the genus Limnœa, having a\r\ncompressed and triangular head with two tentacles and eyes placed at\r\ntheir inner base. They are prolific and gregarious, and their ova are\r\nenclosed in transparent gelatinous capsules, deposited in continuous\r\nseries, and firmly glued to submerged stems and leaves of aquatic\r\nplants. _L. stagnalis_ is common in all ponds, marshes and slow-running\r\nrivers of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.--Ova and young of _Limnæus stagnalis_.]\r\n\r\nOne of the species, _L. trancatula_, is the host of the liver-fluke so\r\nfatal to sheep. The fluke parasite passes one stage of its existence in\r\nthe intestine of the pond snail.\r\n\r\nEach ova-sac of Limnœa contains from fifty to sixty ova (represented\r\nin Fig. 371, at _a_). If examined with a low power soon after the eggs\r\nare deposited, they appear to consist simply of a pellucid protoplasmic\r\nsubstance. In about twenty-four hours a very minute yellowish spot,\r\nthe nucleus, is discovered near the cell-wall. In another twenty-four\r\nhours the nucleus referred to is seen to have assumed a somewhat deeper\r\ncolour and to contain within it a minute spot--a nucleolus.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the nucleus has changed its position, and is\r\nenlarged to double the size; a slightly magnified view is seen at _b_.\r\nOn a closer examination a tranverse fissure is seen; this on the eighth\r\nday divides the small mass as at _c_, and the outer wall is thickened.\r\nThe embryo becomes detached from the side of the cell, and moves with\r\na rotatory motion around the interior; the direction of this motion\r\nis from the right to the left, and is always increased when sunlight\r\nfalls upon it. The increase is gradual up to the eighteenth day, when\r\nthe changes are more distinctly visible, and the ova crowd down to\r\nthe mouth of the ova-sac, as at _d_. By employing a higher magnifying\r\npower a minute black spec, the future eye (_e_) and tentacles of the\r\nsnail, is quite visible. Upon closely observing it, a fringe of cilia\r\nis noticed in motion near the edge of the shell. It is now apparent\r\nthat the rotatory motion first observed must have been in a great\r\nmeasure due to this; and the current kept up in the fluid contents of\r\nthe cell by the ciliary fringes. For days after the young animal has\r\nescaped from the egg, this ciliary motion is carried on, not alone by\r\nthe fringe surrounding the mouth, but by cilia entirely surrounding the\r\ntentacles themselves, which whips up a supply of nourishment, and at\r\nthe same time aeration of the blood is effected. From the twenty-sixth\r\nto the twenty-eighth day it appears actively engaged near the side of\r\nthe egg, using force to break through the cell-wall, which at length\r\nit succeeds in accomplishing; leaving its shell in the ova-sac, and\r\nimmediately attaching itself to the side of the glass its ciliary\r\naction recommences, and it appears to have advanced a stage, as at _f_.\r\nIt is still some months before the embryo grows to the perfect form,\r\nFig. 372; the animal is here shown with its sucker-like foot adhering\r\nclosely to the glass of the aquarium. A single snail will deposit from\r\ntwo to three of these ova-sacs a week, producing, in the course of six\r\nweeks or two months, from 900 to 1,000 young.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 372.--_Limnæus stagnalis_ (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThe shell itself is deposited in minute cells, which take up a circular\r\nposition around the axis; on its under-surface a hyaline membrane is\r\nsecreted. The integument expands, and at various points an internal\r\ncolouring-matter or pigment is deposited. The increase of the animal\r\ngoes on until the expanded foot is formed, the outer edge of which\r\nis rounded off and turned over by condensed tissue in the form of a\r\ntwisted wire; this encloses a network of small vessels filled with a\r\nfluid in constant and rapid motion. The course of the blood or fluid,\r\nas it passes from the heart, may be traced through the larger branches\r\nto the respiratory organs, consisting of branchial-fringes placed\r\nnear the mouth; the blood may also be seen returning through other\r\nvessels. The heart, a strong muscular apparatus, is pear-shaped, and\r\nenclosed within a pericardium or extremely thin and pellucid enveloping\r\nmembrane. The heart is seen to be furnished with muscular bands of\r\nconsiderable strength, the action of which appears like the alternate\r\nto-and-fro motion occasioned by drawing out a band of indiarubber, and\r\nwhich, although so minute, are clearly analogous to the muscular fibres\r\nof the mammal heart; it beats or contracts at the rate of about sixty\r\ntimes a minute, and is placed rather far back in the body, towards the\r\naxis of the shell. The nervous system is made up of ganglia, or nervous\r\ncentres, and distributed throughout the various portions of the body.\r\n\r\nThe singular arrangement of the eye cannot be omitted; it appears at an\r\nearly stage of life to be within the tentacle, and consequently capable\r\nof being retracted into it. In the adult animal the eye is situated at\r\nthe base of the tentacle; and although it can be protruded at pleasure\r\nfor a short distance, it seems to depend much upon the tentacle for\r\nprotection as a coverlid--it invariably draws down the tentacle over\r\nthe eye when that organ needs protection. The eye itself is pyriform,\r\nsomewhat resembling the round figure of the human eye-ball, with its\r\noptic-nerve attached. In colour it is very dark, having a central\r\npupillary-opening for the admission of light. The tentacle, which is\r\ncylindrical in the young animal, becomes flat and triangular in shape\r\nin the adult. The tentacles serve in some respect to distinguish\r\nspecies. In Limnœa they are, as I have said, compressed and triangular,\r\nwith the eyes at their inner base. In Physa they are cylindrical and\r\nslender and without lateral mantle lobes. The development of the\r\nlingual membrane is delayed; consequently, the young animal does not\r\nearly take to a vegetable sustenance: in place of teeth it has two rows\r\nof cilia, as before stated, which drop off when the teeth are fully\r\nformed. The lingual band bearing the teeth, or the “tongue,” as it is\r\ntermed, consists of several rows of cutting spines, pointed with silica.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of some interest, physiologically, to know that if the\r\nyoung animal is kept in fresh water alone, without vegetable matter\r\nof any kind, it retains its cilia, and arrest of development follows,\r\nand it more slowly acquires gastric teeth, and attains to perfection\r\nin form or size. If, at the same time, it is confined within a narrow\r\ncell or space, it grows only to such a size as will enable it to move\r\nabout freely; thus it is made to adapt itself to the necessities\r\nof a restricted state of existence. Some young animals in a narrow\r\nglass-cell, at the end of six months, were alive and well; the cilia\r\nwere seen to be retained around the tentacles in constant activity,\r\nwhilst other animals of the same brood and age, placed in a situation\r\nfavourable to growth, attained their full size, and produced young,\r\nwhich grew in three weeks to the size of their elder relations.[71]\r\n\r\nMy experimental investigations were further extended to the development\r\nof the lingual membrane, or teeth, of Gastropoda, as well as the jaw\r\nand radula. In Limnœa, the teeth when fully developed resemble those\r\nof Helix; that is to say, in the fully grown animal are found several\r\nrows or bands of similar teeth, with simple obtuse cusps and a much\r\nsuppressed central tooth. In the young snail a high power of the\r\nmicroscope is required to make them out. The dental band, however,\r\nin most Mollusca is disposed in longitudinal series, but varies a\r\ngood deal in this respect, as will be seen on reference to my several\r\npapers, with illustrations of upwards of a hundred different species,\r\npublished in “Linnæan Transactions” of 1866, and in the “Microscopical\r\nSociety’s Transactions” of 1868. By way of example I may say, in the\r\nPulmonata the lingual band usually consists of a single median row, the\r\nlaterals on each side being broad and similar. But in many other groups\r\nthe teeth are arranged in three, five, or seven dissimilar series.\r\nTaking Nerita as a type, the broad teeth on each side of the median\r\nare termed _laterals_; and the numerous small teeth on the outside of\r\nthe band, known as the _pleuræ_, are termed _uncini_.\r\n\r\nSince the investigations of Lovén into the lingual dentition of the\r\nMollusca, various observers have studied the subject, with great\r\nadvantage to our knowledge of the affinities of these animals. That\r\nthese investigations have proved of value is shown by the light which\r\nhas been shed on the true position of many species. When once we have\r\nascertained the homology of a genus, whose relations were otherwise\r\nsomewhat doubtful, it is surprising how other characteristics, even\r\nof the shell, probably misunderstood before, concur to bear out\r\nthe affinities indicated by the lingual band. These tooth-bearing\r\nmembranes, armed with sharp cutting points, admirably adapted for the\r\ndivision of the food on which they feed, are most of them beautiful\r\nobjects for the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.\r\n\r\n1. Palate of _Buccinum undatum_, common Whelk, seen under polarised\r\nlight; 2. Palate of _Doris tuberculata_, Sea-slug.]\r\n\r\nThe two ends of each longitudinal row of teeth are connected with\r\nmuscles attached to the upper and lower surfaces of cartilaginous\r\ncushions; the alternate contractions and extensions of the muscles\r\ncause the bands of teeth to work backwards and forwards, after the\r\nfashion of a chain-saw, or rather of a rasp, upon any substance to\r\nwhich it is applied, and the resulting wear and tear of the anterior\r\nteeth are made good by a development of new teeth in the secreting\r\nsac in which the hinder end of the band is lodged. Besides the\r\nchain-saw-like motion of the band the lingual membrane has a kind of\r\nlicking or scraping action as a whole. With the constant growth of the\r\nband new teeth are developed, when the teeth on the extreme portion of\r\nthe band differ much in size and form from those in the median line.\r\n\r\nAs I have shown in the papers already referred to, that as each row\r\nis a repetition of the first, the arrangement of teeth admits of easy\r\nrepresentation by a numerical formula, in which, when the uncini are\r\nvery numerous, they are indicated by the sign ∞ (infinity), and the\r\nothers by the proper figure. Thus, ∞ · 5 · 1 · 5 · ∞, which, in the\r\ngenus Trochus, signifies that each row consists of one median, flanked\r\non both sides by five lateral teeth, and these again by a large number\r\nof uncini. When only three areas are found, the outer ones must be\r\nconsidered the pleuræ, inasmuch as there is frequently a manifest\r\ndivision in the membrane between them and the lateral areas.\r\n\r\nMost of the Cephalopod molluscs are provided with well-developed\r\nteeth, and they are, as we know, carnivorous. The teeth of the\r\ncuttle-fish, _Sepia officinalis_ (Plate V., No. 111), resemble those\r\nof the Pteropoda, and have the same formula, 3 · 1 · 3. Sepia are also\r\nfurnished with a retractile proboscis, and a prehensile spiny collar,\r\napparently for the purpose of seizing and holding prey while the teeth\r\nare tearing it to pieces. In the squid Loligo (Plate V., No. 113) the\r\nmedian teeth are broad at the base, approach the tricuspid form with\r\na prolonged acute central cusp, while the uncini are much prolonged\r\nand slightly curved. The lingual band increases in breadth towards\r\nthe base, sometimes to twice that of the anterior portion. This band,\r\nmounted dry, forms an attractive object for black-ground illumination.\r\n\r\nIn another family, that of the rock-limpet, _Patella radiata_, the\r\nlingual band (Plate V., No. 116) well serves to distinguish it from\r\nthe better-known common limpet. It is furnished with a remarkable long\r\nribbon, studded by numerous rows of strong dark-brown tricuspid teeth.\r\nThe lingual membrane when not in use lies folded up in the abdominal\r\ncavity. The teeth of Acmæa are somewhat differently arranged (Plate V.,\r\nNo. 117); their formula is 3 · 1 · 3.\r\n\r\n_Testacella maugei_, belonging to Pulmonifera, is slug-like in\r\nappearance, and subterranean in its habits, chiefly feeding on\r\nearth-worms. During winter and in dry weather it forms a kind of\r\ncocoon, and thus completely encloses itself in an opaque white mantle;\r\nin this way it protects itself from frost and cold. Its lingual\r\nmembrane is large, and covered with about fifty rows of divergent\r\nteeth, gradually diminishing in size towards the median row; each\r\ntooth is barbed and pointed, broader towards the base, and with an\r\narticulating nipple set in the basement membrane. A few rows are\r\nrepresented slightly magnified (Plate V., No. 121). Their formula is 0\r\n0 · 1 · 0 0.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONGUES, ETC., OF GASTEROPODS.\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      W. F. Maples, ad. nat. del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE V.]\r\n\r\nThe boat-shell, _Cymba olla_, belonging to the Velutinidæ, formula 0 ·\r\n1 · 0, or 1 · 1 · 1. The lingual band (Plate V., No. 118) is narrow and\r\nribbon-like in its appearance, with numerous trident-shaped teeth set\r\non a strong muscular membrane. The end of the band and its connection\r\nwith the muscles at the extremity of the cartilaginous cushion is shown\r\nin the drawing. The blueish appearance is produced by a selenite film\r\nand polarised light. In _Scapander ligniarius_ the band (Plate V.,\r\nNo. 119) is also narrow, but the teeth are bold and of extraordinary\r\nsize; their formula is 1 · 0 · 1. This mollusc is said to be eyeless.\r\n_Pleurobranchus plumula_ belongs to the same family; its teeth are\r\nsimple, recurved, and convex, and arranged in numerous divergent rows,\r\nthe medians of which are largest. The mandible (Plate V., No. 122)\r\npresents an exceedingly pretty tesselated appearance, and the numerous\r\ndivergent rows of teeth are tricuspid.\r\n\r\nThe velvety-shell, _Velutina lævigata_, formula 3 · 1 · 3. The teeth\r\n(Plate V., No. 108) are small and fine; medians recurved, with a series\r\nof delicate denticulations on either side of the central cusp, which is\r\nmuch prolonged: 1st laterals, denticulate, with outer cusp prolonged;\r\n2nd and 3rd laterals, simple curved or hooked-shaped. The mandible\r\n(No. 109), divided in the centre, forms two plates of divergent\r\ndenticulations.\r\n\r\nThe ear-shell, _Haliotis tuberculatus_, is a well-known beautiful\r\nshell, much used for ornamental purposes. The lingual band (Plate V.,\r\nNo. 114), is well developed. The medians are flattened-out, recurved\r\nobtuse teeth; 1st laterals, trapezoidal or beam-like; uncini numerous,\r\nabout sixty, denticulate, the few first pairs prolonged into strong\r\npointed cusps.\r\n\r\nThe top-shell, _Turbo marmoratus_. After the outer layer of shell is\r\nremoved, it presents a delicate pearly appearance. Its lingual band\r\n(No. 123) closely resembles Trochus; it is long and narrow, the median\r\nteeth are broadest, with five recurved laterals, and numerous rows of\r\nuncini, slender and hooked. A single row only is represented in the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n_Cyclotus translucidus_, a family of operculate land-shells, belongs\r\nto the Cyclostomatidæ. The teeth shown in No. 110, formula 3 · 1 · 3,\r\nare arranged in slightly divergent rows on a narrow band; they are more\r\nor less subquadrate, recurved, with their central cusps prolonged.\r\n_Cistula catenata_, one of the family Cyclophoridæ; its band (No. 115)\r\nformula, 2 · 1 · 2. Its teeth resemble those of Littorina. The lingual\r\nband of Cyclostomatidæ points out a near alliance to the Trochidæ;\r\nbut this question can only be determined by an examination of several\r\nspecies, when it may, perhaps, be decided to give them rank as a\r\nsub-order. They are numerous enough; the West Indian islands alone\r\nfurnish 200 species.\r\n\r\nThe length of the lingual band, and number of rows of teeth borne on\r\nit, vary greatly in different species. But it is among the Pulmonifera\r\nwe meet with the most astonishing instances of large numbers of teeth.\r\n_Limax maximus_ possesses 26,800, distributed through 180 rows of 160\r\neach, the individual teeth measuring only one 10,000th of an inch.\r\n_Helix pomatia_ has 21,000, and its comparatively dwarfed congener, _H.\r\nabsoluta_, no less than 15,000.\r\n\r\n_Structure of the Shell of Mollusca._--In my opening sketch of the\r\nsub-order Mollusca an idea may have been gathered of the general\r\ncharacter of the shell covering of these animals. The simplest form of\r\nshell occurs in the rudimentary oval plate of the common slug, _Limax\r\nrufus_. It is embedded in the shield situated at the back, near the\r\nhead of the animal. In the Chitons, a small but singular group of\r\nmolluscs allied to the univalve limpets, we have an ovoid shell, made\r\nup of eight segments, or movable plates, which give them a resemblance\r\nto enormous woodlice. These have been regarded as forming a transition\r\nseries--a link between one division and the other. The shell in by\r\nfar the greater portion of all the molluscs is developed from cells\r\nthat in process of growth have become hardened by the deposition\r\nof calcareous matter in the interior. This earthy matter consists\r\nprincipally of calcium carbonate deposited in a crystalline state; and\r\nin certain shells, as in that of the oyster (Plate XVIII., Fig. 8),\r\nfrom the animal cell not having sufficiently controlled the mode\r\nof deposition of the earth particles, they have assumed the form of\r\nperfect rhomboidal crystals.[72]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nSECTIONS OF SHELL-STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nThe shell of the wing-shells, _Pinna ingens_ (Plate XVIII., No. 7),\r\nis composed of hexagonal cells, filled with partially translucent\r\ncalcareous matter, the outer layer of which can be split up into\r\nprism-like columns. Figs. 3 and 6 are horizontal sections of the\r\n_Haliotis splendens_, with stellate pigment in a portion of the\r\nsection, and wavy lines, as in the dentine of the human tooth, and of\r\n_Terebratulata rubicuna_, showing radiating perforations. Nos. 4 and\r\n5, sections of the shell of a crab, show pigment granules beneath the\r\narticular layer and the general hexagonal structure of the next layer.\r\n\r\nSome difference of opinion has been expressed with regard to the\r\nformation of pearls, but it is now generally understood to be a\r\ndiseased condition. Pearls are matured on a nucleus, consisting of the\r\nsame matter as that from which the new layers of shell proceed at the\r\nedge of the mussel or oyster. The finest kinds are formed in the body\r\nof the animal, or originate in the pearly-looking part of the shell. It\r\nis from the size, roundness, and brilliancy of pearls that their value\r\nis estimated.\r\n\r\nThe microscope discloses a difference in the structure of pearls: those\r\nhaving a prismatic cellular structure have a brown horny nucleus,\r\nsurrounded by small imperfectly-formed prismatic cells; there is\r\nalso a ring of horny matter, followed by other prisms, and so on, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 374; and all transverse sections of pearls from\r\noysters show the same successive rings of growth or deposit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.\r\n\r\n1. A transverse section of a Pearl from Oyster, showing its prismatic\r\nstructure 2. A transverse section of another Pearl, showing its\r\ncentral cellular structure, with outside rings of true pearly matter.\r\n(Magnified 50 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nIn a segment of a transverse section of a small purple pearl from a\r\nspecies of Mytilus (Fig. 375), all trace of prismatic structure has\r\ndisappeared, and only a series of fine curved or radiating lines is\r\nseen. This pearl consists of a beautiful purple-coloured series of\r\nregular laminæ, many of which have a series of concentric zones, and\r\nare of a yellow tint. The most beautiful sections for microscopic\r\nexamination are obtained from Scotch pearls.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Teeth and Shell of Mollusca for Microscopical\r\nExamination._--The method of preparing lingual membranes of Mollusca\r\nis as follows: Under a dissecting microscope, and with a large bull’s\r\neye lens, cut open and expose to view the floor of the mouth; pin back\r\nthe cut edges throughout its length, and work out the dental band with\r\nknife and forceps. The band being detached, place it in a watch-glass,\r\nand boil in caustic potash solution for a few minutes. Having by this\r\nprocess freed the tongue from its integuments, remove it, wash it well,\r\nand place it for a short time in a dilute acid solution, either acetic\r\nor hydrochloric. Wash it well and float it upon a slide; with a fine\r\nsable brush open it out flat, and remove whatever dirt or fibre may be\r\nadhering to it. Lastly, place it in weak spirit and water, and there\r\nlet it remain for a few days before mounting in formalin. Canada balsam\r\nrenders them rather too pellucid, and the finer teeth are thereby lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.\r\n\r\n1. Transverse section of a small Pearl from a Mytilus; 2. Horizontal\r\nsection magnified 240 diameters to show prismatic structure and\r\ntransverse striæ.]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of shell structure must be proceeded with with some\r\namount of care and caution, or the delicate reticulated network\r\nmembrane will be destroyed. If any acid solvent be used to remove the\r\ncalcareous structure it should be much diluted, so that the action\r\nmay proceed slowly rather than hastily. In the young hermit-crab, for\r\nexample, where the calcareous and membranous portions of the shell\r\nare continuous, and the calcium carbonate in a relatively small\r\nproportion, a strong acid solution would entirely destroy the specimen.\r\nIn the case of nacreous shells the process of cutting and grinding\r\nmust also be proceeded with with some amount of caution. The operation\r\nshould be examined as the process proceeds, and under polarised light.\r\nSections of shell structure are usually mounted in Canada balsam. Under\r\nthe heading _Technique_ much useful information on this and kindred\r\nsubjects will be found in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical\r\nSociety.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnulosa, Worms, and Entozoa.\r\n\r\nThe Annulosa of Huxley embraces the lowest grade of articulated\r\nanimals, most of which are now grouped with Metazoa, while some\r\nwriters place them in a sub-kingdom Vermes. It appears to me then only\r\npossible to describe this heterogeneous group of worm-like animals\r\namong those which resemble each other in certain negative features, but\r\nnot possessing any of the distinctive characters of those previously\r\ndescribed. There are numerous species among Entozoa, every one of which\r\nis of the highest interest to mankind in general, and to animal life as\r\na whole. To these I shall devote some attention, from the wide-spread\r\nimportance attached to them. They are characterised by having a soft\r\nabsorbent body with little or no colour, in consequence of being\r\nexcluded from light, living within the bodies of animals and absorbing\r\ntheir vital juices, thereby inflicting a large amount of injury and\r\ndeath upon the whole vertebrate kingdom. They bear in this respect a\r\nclose analogy to parasitic Fungi in the nature of their destructive\r\naction upon plant life, which I have fully discussed in a previous\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe relations which obtain between parasites and their hosts are in all\r\nrespects conditioned by their natural history; and without a detailed\r\nknowledge of the organisation, the development, and the mode of life\r\nof the different species, it is impossible to determine the nature and\r\nextent of the pathological conditions to which they give rise, and at\r\nthe same time find means of protection against guests in every way so\r\nunwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive system of the entozoa must be regarded as in the lowest\r\nstate of development, yet there are some among them of a higher grade,\r\nas will be seen as we proceed. All are remarkable alike for their\r\nvast productiveness and for their peculiar metamorphoses. For example,\r\nthe greater number of the Tænia begin their lives as sexless, encysted\r\nlarvæ, and on entering their final abode, segments are successively\r\nadded, until the worm has finally reached the adult stage. Again, the\r\ntapeworm of the cat has its origin in the encysted larvæ found in the\r\nlivers of the mouse and rat. Another species of entozoa inhabit the\r\nstomach of the stickle-back, and only attain their perfect form in\r\nthe stomachs of aquatic birds that feed exclusively on fish. Another\r\ninfests the mantle of pond-snails, and through their agency, the\r\nembryos pass into the stomach of sheep.\r\n\r\nAn almost endless number of similar transformations take place in other\r\ngenera. The simplest form among internal parasites is the Gregarinæ,\r\nformerly grouped among Protozoa. They consist of a simple limiting\r\nmembrane, with a mass of granular matter enclosed and surrounding a\r\nnucleus (Plate III., No. 53). These parasites pass through a crystoid\r\nstage in the body of one of the lower animals, usually the earthworm,\r\n_Lumbricus agricola_. In the more mature organism an envelope,\r\ndifferentiated from the protoplasm within, can be made out (No. 54);\r\nthis affords an indication of greater differentiation in the subjacent\r\nlayer of protoplasm. An anterior portion is in many cases separated\r\nby a constriction from the cylindrical or band-like body (No. 56).\r\nGregarinæ multiply when encysted, and divide into a multitude of\r\nminute _pseudo-navicula_, so named from their resemblance in shape to\r\na well-known form of Diatomaceæ. When a young pseudo-navicule escapes\r\nit behaves somewhat like an amœba, and if perchance it is swallowed by\r\nan appropriate host, it develops at once into the higher stage. The\r\nvarious forms are represented in Plate III., Nos. 53--61. Miescher, in\r\n1843, described suchlike bodies, taken from the muscles of a mouse.\r\nA good account of specimens obtained from the muscles of a pig was\r\npublished by the late Mr. Rainey in the “Philosophical Transactions,”\r\n1857. He regarded them as cestoid entozoa. They have been described\r\nunder a variety of names, as worm-nodules, egg-sacs, eggs of the fluke,\r\nyoung measles, &c. M. Lieberkühn carefully traced the pseudo-naviculæ\r\nafter leaving the perivisceral cavity of the earth-worm; he found\r\nlarge numbers of small corpuscles, exhibiting amœba-like movements,\r\nas well as pseudo-naviculæ, containing granules, formed in an encysted\r\nGregarinæ. He imagines that these latter bodies burst, and that their\r\ncontained granules develop into the amœbiform bodies which subsequently\r\nbecome Gregarinæ.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ray Lankester made a careful examination of more than a\r\nhundred worms for the purpose of studying these questions, but he\r\nsucceeded in arriving at no other conclusion than that certain forms\r\nmay be the by-products of encysted Gregarinæ. The _G. lumbricus_ is one\r\nof those forms which are unilocular. The vesicle is not always very\r\ndistinct, and is sometimes altogether absent; occasionally it contains\r\nno granules, sometimes several, one of which is generally nucleated. In\r\nother of these cysts a number of nucleated cells may be seen developing\r\nfrom the enclosed Gregarina, which gradually become fused together and\r\nbroken up, until the entire mass is converted into nucleated bodies,\r\noften seen in different stages of development, assuming the form of\r\na double cone, as that presented by certain species of Diatomaceæ.\r\nAt length the cyst contains nothing but pseudo-naviculæ, sometimes\r\nenclosing granules; these gradually disappear, and finally the cyst\r\nbursts. Encystation seems to take place much more rarely among the\r\nbilocular forms of Gregarinæ than in the unilocular species found in\r\nthe earthworm and other Annelids.[73]\r\n\r\nDr. J. Leidy published in the “Transactions of the Philadelphia\r\nSociety,” 1853, the results of his examinations of several new species\r\nof Gregarinæ. He described a double membrane “within the parietal tunic\r\nof the posterior sac, this being transparent, colourless, and marked\r\nby a most beautiful set of exceedingly regular parallel longitudinal\r\nlines.”\r\n\r\nProfessor R. Leuckart is the latest writer on the parasites of animals,\r\nand to him we are indebted for a more systematic account of the whole\r\ngroup, and their life-history, than to any previous investigator. I\r\ncan only attempt to give a mere outline of the developmental stages\r\nof a few typical forms of parasites, commencing with the cystic\r\ntapeworm, Tænia. These worms are ribbon-like in appearance, and are\r\ndivided throughout the greater part of their length into segments,\r\nand their usual habitation is the intestinal cavity of vertebrate\r\nanimals. The anterior extremity of a tænoid worm is usually called\r\nthe head, and bears the organ by which the animal attaches itself to\r\nthe mucous membrane of the creature which it infests. These organs\r\nare either suckers, or hooks, or both conjoined. In Tænia, four\r\nsuckers are combined with a circlet of hooks, disposed around a median\r\nterminal prominence. The embryo passes through certain stages of\r\ndevelopment--viz., four forms or changes: but the embryo itself is\r\nvery peculiar, consisting of an oval non-ciliated mass, provided with\r\nsix hooks, three upon each side of the middle line. Tænia are found\r\nenclosed in various situations besides that of the alimentary canal:\r\nthe eye, the brain, the muscular tissues, the liver, &c., of animals.\r\nThe following cystic worms are usually included in this genera,\r\n_Cysticercus Anthocephalus_, _Cœnurus_, and _T. Echinococcus_. Plate\r\nIV., No. 100, shows an adult specimen of the latter with rostellum\r\nsuckers, and three successive segments, the last of which is the ova\r\nsac. The water-vascular system is represented coloured by carmine. This\r\nparasite infests the human body as frequently as many other species. My\r\naccurately-drawn figure is copied from Cobbold’s “Introduction to the\r\nStudy of Entozoa.”\r\n\r\n_Cysticercus fasciolaris_ is developed within the liver of white\r\nmice; _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ in the muscles of the pig; hence we\r\nhave the diseased state of pork familiarly known as “_measly pork_.”\r\nShould a lamb become infested with Tænia the final transformation\r\nwill be different; within a fortnight symptoms of a disease known as\r\n“staggers” manifest themselves, and in the course of a few weeks the\r\n_Cœnurus cerebralis_ will be developed within the brain. Von Siebold\r\npointed out the bearing of this fact upon the important practical\r\nproblem of the prevention of “staggers.” Others belonging to the same\r\nclass of parasites are quite as remarkable in their preference for the\r\nalimentary canal of fishes. The Echinorhynchus is developed in the\r\nintestinal canal of the flounder, _Triænophorus nodulus_ in the liver\r\nof the salmon. Thus, by careful and repeated observation with the\r\nmicroscope, a close connection is found to exist between the cystic and\r\ncestoid entozoa.\r\n\r\nThe Echinococcus (Plate IV., No. 101) infests the human liver. These\r\nparasites are always found in cysts, and in closed cavities in the\r\ninterior of the body. They are united in fours by a very short stalk\r\nor pedicle, common to the whole. By an increase of magnification the\r\ncontents of a cyst present the several structures represented in Fig.\r\n376.\r\n\r\nEchinorhynchus, or spiny-headed threadworms, constitute a group\r\nof entozoa which undergo a metamorphosis hardly, perhaps, less\r\nremarkable than that known to take place in other Nematode worms.\r\nLeuckart instituted, in 1861, a series of experiments with the ova of\r\n_Echinorhynchus proteus_ found parasitic upon the _Gammarus pulex_.\r\nThe ova of _E. proteus_ resemble in form and structure those of allied\r\nspecies. They are of a fusiform shape, surrounded with two membranes,\r\nan _external_ of a more albuminous nature, and an _internal_ chitinous\r\none. When the eggs reach the intestine the outer of these membranes is\r\nabsent, being in fact digested, while the inner remains intact until\r\nruptured by the embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376.--Cystic Disease of Liver (Human).\r\n\r\n_a._ Cyst with Echinococcus enclosed; _b._ detached hooklets from the\r\nhead of Echinococcus, magnified 250 diameters; _c._ crystals found in\r\ncyst, chiefly cholesterine; _d._ cylindrical epithelium, some enclosed\r\nin structureless vesicles; _e._ Puro-muculent granules, fat and blood\r\ncorpuscles.]\r\n\r\nThe typical Threadworm belonging to the order Nematoidea infest the\r\nintestines of children, and are a source of much suffering. The egg is\r\nelliptical, and contains a mass of granular protoplasm, the external\r\nwall of which soon becomes marked out into a layer of cells. The mouth\r\nof the worm appears as a depression at the end of the blunt head. When\r\nthe muscular system and alimentary canal are developed the embryo\r\nhatches out, some few of which are free living forms; most of them\r\nlead a parasitic life. Their reproduction is enormous, representing\r\nthousands of eggs and embryos.\r\n\r\nOf the non-parasitic species of thread-worm, the common vinegar\r\neel, Anguillula,[74] affords an example. This is found in polluted\r\nwater, bog-moss, and moist earth, as well as in vinegar; also in the\r\nalimentary canal of the pond-snail, the frog, fish, &c. Another species\r\nis met with in the ears of wheat affected with a blight termed the\r\n“cockle”; another, the _A. glutinis_, in sour paste. If grains of the\r\naffected wheat are soaked in water for an hour or two before they are\r\ncut open, the so called “eels” will be found. The paste-eel makes its\r\nappearance spontaneously just as the pasty mass is turning sour; the\r\nmeans of securing a supply for microscopical examination consists in\r\nallowing a portion of the paste in which they show themselves to dry\r\nup, and laying it by for stock; if at any time a portion of this is\r\nintroduced into a little fresh-made paste, and the whole kept warm and\r\nmoist for a few hours, it will be found to swarm with these wriggling\r\nlittle worms. A small portion of paste spread over the face of a\r\nCoddington lens is a ready way of viewing them.\r\n\r\n_Trichina spiralis._--One of the smallest and most dangerous of all\r\nhuman internal parasites is _T. spiralis_, since it finds its way into\r\nthe muscles throughout the human body. The young animal presents the\r\nform of a spirally-coiled worm in the interior of a minute oval-shaped\r\ncyst (Plate IV., No. 104), a mere speck scarcely visible to the naked\r\neye. In the muscular structure it resembles a small millet seed,\r\nsomewhat calcareous in composition. The history of the development of\r\nTrichina in the human muscle is briefly that in a few hours after the\r\ningestion of infected pork, Trichina, disengaged from the muscle, will\r\nbe found in the stomach: hence they pass into the small intestine,\r\nwhere they are further developed. Continuing their migrations, they\r\npenetrate far into the interior of the primitive muscular fasciculi,\r\nwhere they will be found, in about three days after ingestion, in\r\nconsiderable numbers, and so far developed that the young entozoa have\r\nalmost attained a size equal to that of the full-grown Trichina (Plate\r\nIV., No. 105). They quickly advance into the interior of the muscular\r\nfasciculi, where they live and multiply in continuous series, while\r\nthe surrounding structures as well as the muscular tissue undergo a\r\nprocess of histolysis. The destructive nature of the parasite is very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe number of progeny produced by one female may amount to several\r\nthousands, and as soon as they leave the egg they either penetrate\r\nthrough the blood-vessels, or are carried on by the circulation, and\r\nultimately become lodged in the muscles situated in the most distant\r\nparts of the body. Here, as already explained, they become encysted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 377.--Monads in Rat’s Blood, stained with methyl violet, showing\r\nmembrane under different aspects; blood-corpuscles, some crenated and\r\nothers with stained discs (× 1,200).--(Crookshank.)]\r\n\r\nProfessor Virchow draws the following conclusions:--“1. The ingestion\r\nof pig’s flesh, fresh or badly dressed, containing Trichinæ, is\r\nattended with the greatest danger, and may prove the proximate cause of\r\ndeath. 2. The Trichinæ maintain their living properties in decomposed\r\nflesh; they resist immersion in water for weeks together, and when\r\nencysted may, without injury to their vitality, be plunged in a\r\nsufficiently dilute solution of chromic acid for at least ten days. 3.\r\nOn the contrary, they perish and are deprived of all noxious influence\r\nin ham which has been well smoked, kept a sufficient length of time,\r\nand then well boiled before it is consumed.”\r\n\r\nA more minute Filarian worm has been detected in the human\r\nblood-vessels, known as _Filaria sanguinis hominis_. This worm carries\r\non its work of destruction throughout the night; during the day it\r\nremains perfectly passive. It increases rapidly, and produces swellings\r\nof the glandular structures of the body, somewhat after the nature of\r\nthose characteristic of the Bombay plague, with a slight difference,\r\nthat after death the swellings are seen to be due to the vast\r\naccumulations of the _Filaria sanguinis_ blocking the blood-vessels.\r\nThe accompanying Fig. 377 shows a similar infiltration of monads in the\r\nblood of rats dying of plague in Bombay.\r\n\r\n_Trematode Worms._--In the order Trematoda, to which the fluke belongs,\r\nthe body is unsegmented, and to the naked eye smooth throughout, with\r\na blood circulatory system, and two suctorial discs at the hinder end.\r\nThere is a distinct digestive canal, usually forked, furnished with\r\nonly one aperture, the mouth. The excretory organs open out as in tape\r\nworms, and the male and female organs co-exist in the same individual.\r\n\r\nThe Fluke (shown in Plate IV., No. 103) is cone-shaped, and is the\r\n_Amphistome conicum_ of Rudolphi. This parasite is common in oxen,\r\nsheep, and deer, and it has also been found in the Dorcas antelope.\r\nIt invariably takes up its abode in the first stomach, or rumen,\r\nattaching itself to the papillated folds of the mucous membrane. In the\r\nfull-grown, adult stage, it rarely exceeds half an inch in length. It\r\nis certainly one of the most remarkable in form and organisation of any\r\nof the internal parasites.\r\n\r\nThe larger fluke (_Fasciola hepatica_) often attains to an inch or\r\nmore in size. It is not only of frequent occurrence in all varieties\r\nof grazing cattle, but has likewise been found in the horse, the ass,\r\nand also in the hare and rabbit and other animals. Its occurrence\r\nin man has been recorded by more than one observer. The oral sucker\r\nforming the mouth leads to a short œsophagus, which very soon divides\r\ninto two primary stomachal or intestinal trunks, the latter in their\r\nturn sending off branches; the whole together forming that attractive\r\ndendritic system of vessels so often compared to plant-venation.\r\nThis remarkably-formed digestive apparatus is represented in Plate\r\nIV., Nos. 106 and 107, _Fasciola gigantea_ of Cobbold, and should\r\nbe contrasted with the somewhat similarly racemose character of the\r\nwater-vascular system. Let it be expressly noted, however, that in the\r\ndigestive system the majority of the tubes branch out in a direction\r\nobliquely downwards, whereas those of the vascular system slope\r\nobliquely upwards. A further comparison of the disposition of these\r\ntwo systems of structure, with the same systems figured and described\r\nas characteristic of the Amphistoma, will at once serve to demonstrate\r\nthe important differences which subsist between the several members\r\nof the two genera, if we turn to the consideration of the habits of\r\n_Fasciola hepatica_, which, in so far as they relate to excitation of\r\nthe liver disease in sheep, acquire the highest practical importance.\r\nIntelligent cattle-breeders, agriculturists, and veterinarians have\r\nall along observed that the _rot_, as this disease is commonly called,\r\nis particularly prevalent after long-continued wet weather, and more\r\nespecially so if there have been a succession of wet seasons; and\r\nfrom this circumstance they have very naturally inferred that the\r\nhumidity of the atmosphere, coupled with a moist condition of the soil,\r\nforms the sole cause of the malady. Co-ordinating with these facts,\r\nit has likewise been noticed that the flocks grazing in low pastures\r\nand marshy districts are much more liable to the invasion of this\r\nendemic disease than are those pasturing on higher and drier grounds;\r\na noteworthy exception occurring in the case of those flocks feeding\r\nin the salt-water marshes on our eastern shores. Plate IV., No. 106,\r\n_Fasciola gigantea_: the anterior surface is exposed to display oral\r\nand ventral suckers, and the dendriform digestive apparatus injected\r\nwith ultra-marine; No. 107 shows the dorsal aspect of the specimen and\r\nthe multiramose character of the water-vascular system, the vessels\r\nbeing injected with vermilion.\r\n\r\nIn their larval condition the Amphistoma live in or upon the body of\r\nthe pond-snail. This we infer from the circumstance that the larvæ, or\r\ncercariæ, of a closely-allied species, the _Amphistoma subclavatum_,\r\nare known to infest the alimentary canal of frogs and newts, and have\r\nalso been found on the body of the Planorbis by myself. The cercariæ\r\nlarvæ are taken, it is believed, by the sheep and the cattle while\r\ndrinking. The earliest embryotic stage in which I have found the embryo\r\nfluke is represented at Fig. 378, No. 1. In the year 1854, whilst\r\nobserving the habits of Limnœa and other water-snails, I brought home\r\nspecimens from the ornamental water in the Botanic Gardens; upon these\r\nwere discovered thousands of minute thread-like worms, subsequently\r\nmet with on other embryos, and at first taken to be simple infusorial\r\nanimals, but upon placing them in a glass vessel these minute bodies\r\nwere observed to detach themselves and commence a free-swimming\r\nexistence. A fringe of cilia was seen to surround the flask-shaped body\r\n(No. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378.--Forms of Cercaria; stages in the development\r\nof the Fluke.\r\n\r\n1. An infusorial embryo; 2. a Trematode embryo having quite recently\r\nescaped from the egg; 3. embryo cercaria; 4. fully-formed cercaria,\r\nshowing alimentary canal and sucker-like head; 5. encysted form of\r\nsame; 6. _Cercaria furcata_, with the nervous system and forked tail\r\ndisplayed; 7. in the act of breaking up; 8. tail portion half an hour\r\nafter division; 9. parasitic worm of another species of Trematoda.\r\n(Magnified from 10 to 25 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nThe study of these embryos throws a flood of light upon the obscure\r\nhistory of Cercariæ. After a short period of wandering, their embryos\r\nfasten upon the water-snail, and compel it to act as a wet-nurse,\r\nand prepare it for a further and higher stage of life. The earliest\r\ncondition in which I have discovered them concealed about the body of\r\nthe water-snail is shown at No. 2; in appearance, a simple elongated\r\nsac filled with ova or germs, and which in a short time develop into\r\nthe caudate worms already spoken of; their tails gradually attaining\r\nto the length of the mature embryos, Nos. 3 and 4, the latter being a\r\nfull-grown _Cercaria ephemera_.\r\n\r\nDiesing described no less than twelve species of Cercariæ, some of\r\nthe most curious of which live on the puddle-snail, in colonies of\r\nthousands. All throw off their tails at the moment of changing into\r\na fluke. On placing some _Cercaria furcata_ (Nos. 6 and 7) under\r\nthe microscope, they were seen to plunge about in frantic attempts\r\nto escape from confinement. Suddenly I saw them shed their tails\r\nand their bodies divide into two parts, each half swimming about as\r\nvigorously as before, quite indifferent as to the severance, and\r\napparently dying from exhaustion. Those represented in Nos. 6 and 7\r\nhave a highly-organised nervous system, forming a continuous circuit\r\nthroughout the body and tail. The mouth is furnished with a sucker and\r\nhooklets, which can be projected out some distance, while a digestive\r\napparatus and ventral opening or sucker can be differentiated.\r\nThe tail is bifurcated and articulated with the body by a sort of\r\nball-and-socket joint, and when broken off, the convexity of one part\r\nis seen to accurately fit into the concavity of the other; it lashes\r\nabout this appendage with considerable dexterity, rarely attaching\r\nitself to any of the small aquatic plants.[75]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another Filarian worm, a pest to the poultry-yard, the\r\nGape-worm, _Sclerostoma syngamus_. This parasite is widely distributed,\r\nand is invested with special interest, since it produces disease, and\r\nkills annually thousands of young chickens, pheasants, partridges,\r\nand many of the larger kinds of wild birds. The worms find their way\r\ninto the windpipe or tracheæ, through the drinking water, while in\r\nthe embryotic or cercarian stage of existence, and their increase is\r\nso rapid, the birds quickly die of suffocation. The female gape-worm\r\noften attains to a considerable size, and when full grown resembles the\r\nwell-known mud-worm of the Thames (_Gordius aquaticus_). She measures\r\nfull six-eighths of an inch in length, while the male only measures\r\none-eighth. So insignificantly small is he that the female carries him\r\nabout tucked into a side pocket. The ova sac occupies a considerable\r\nportion of the internal body space, and is always found loaded with\r\neggs in all stages of development, numbering some five hundred or a\r\nthousand. In shape these are ovoid. On cutting open the windpipe of\r\nchicken and partridges, I have found their tracheæ literally swarming\r\nwith the gape-worm.[76]\r\n\r\nA remarkable form of the Trematode worm is _Bilharzia hæmatobra_ of\r\nCobbold, _Distomia hæmatobium_ of other authors (Plate IV., No. 102).\r\nThis genus of fluke, discovered by Dr. Bilharz in the human portal\r\nsystem of blood vessels, gives rise to a very serious state of disease\r\namong the Egyptians. So common is the occurrence of this worm, that\r\nthis physician expressed his belief that half the grown-up population\r\nof Egypt suffer from it. Griesinger conjectures that the young of the\r\nparasite exist in the waters of the Nile, and in the fish which abound.\r\nDr. Cobbold thinks “it more probable that the larvæ, in the form of\r\ncercariæ, rediæ, and sporocysts, will be found in certain gasteropod\r\nmollusca proper to the locality.” The anatomy of this fluke is fully\r\ndescribed by Küchenmeister in his book on parasites, by Leuckart,[77]\r\nand by Cobbold. The eggs and embryos of Bilharzia are peculiar in\r\npossessing the power of altering their forms in both stages of life;\r\nand it is more than probable that the embryo form has been mistaken for\r\nsome extraordinary form of ciliated infusorial animal, its movements\r\nbeing quick and lively. We cannot fail to notice the curious form of\r\nthe male animal, and, unlike the Filarian previously described, it is\r\nhe who carries the female about and feeds her. The whip-like appendage\r\nseen in the figure is a portion of the body of the female. The disease\r\nproduced by this parasite is said to be more virulent in the summer\r\nmonths, probably owing to the greater abundance of cercarian larvæ at\r\nthis period of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.--The double parasitic worm (_Diplozoum\r\nparadoxum_).]\r\n\r\nThere are also double parasitic worms, which may be described as a\r\nsub-order of Trematoda, differing very much from those previously\r\ndescribed. These live on the gills of several species of fresh-water\r\nfish, the gudgeon and minnow, for instance. Among them is a most\r\nremarkable creature well deserving the name of _Diplozoum paradoxum_\r\nwhich has been bestowed upon it. It consists of two complete mature\r\nsimilar halves, each possessing every attribute of a perfect animal\r\n(_a_). Each of the pointed front ends has a mouth aperture, and close\r\nto it two small sucking discs; while each individual has a separate\r\nintestine, consisting of a medium tube and innumerable side-branches.\r\nAt the hinder end of the body are two suckers sunk in a depression, and\r\nprotected by four hard buckle-shaped organs. The eggs are elongated,\r\nand provided at one end with a fine thread-like appendage (_b_). In\r\nthis egg the young (_c_)--which at the time of hatching is only about\r\none-hundredth of an inch--takes about a fortnight to develop. It is\r\ncovered with cilia, has two eyes and two suckers; after quitting the\r\negg, the larvæ are very lively and restless in their movements,\r\ngliding about and then swimming off with rapidity. If unable to find\r\nthe fish into which they are destined to live, they grow feeble and\r\nperish, but if successful they grow into the Diporpa (_d_), which is\r\nflattened and lancet-shaped, and bears a small sucking disc on the\r\nunder surface and a conical excrescence on the back. After living in\r\nthis state for some weeks, and gaining nourishment by sucking the blood\r\nfrom the fish’s gills, the worms begin to join together in pairs, one\r\nspecimen seizing the conical excrescence of another by its ventrical\r\nsucker; then, by a truly acrobatic feat, the second twists itself to\r\nthe dorsal excrescence of the first, and in this state an inseparable\r\nfusion takes place between the suckers and the excrescences involved in\r\nthe adhesion.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the group Vermes, the more highly-organised Annelida must be\r\nincluded. These, for the most part, live either in fresh or salt water.\r\nThe Annelids are various, while the Planaria, a genus of Turbellaria,\r\nare very common in pools, and resemble minute leeches; their motion is\r\ncontinuous and gliding, and they are always found crawling over the\r\nsurfaces of aquatic plants and animals, both in fresh and salt water.\r\nThe body has the flattened sole-like shape of the _Trematode entozoa_\r\n(Fig. 378, No. 9), the mouth is surrounded by a circular sucker; this\r\nis applied to the surface of the plant from which the animal draws its\r\nnourishment; it is also furnished with a rather long proboscis, which\r\nis probably employed for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nPlanariæ multiply by eggs, and by spontaneous fissuration in a\r\ntransverse direction, each segment becoming a perfect animal. Professor\r\nAgassiz believes that the infusorial animals, Paramæcium and Kolpoda,\r\nare simply planarian larvæ.\r\n\r\nHirudinidæ, the leech tribe, are usually believed to form a link\r\nbetween the Annelida on the one hand, and the Trematoda on the other;\r\ntheir affinities place them closer with the latter than the former.\r\nAlthough deprived of the characteristic setæ of the Annelida, and\r\nexhibiting no sectional divisions, they are provided with a sucker-like\r\nmouth possessed by Trematoda, but they present no resemblance to them\r\nin their reproductive organs. On the other hand, in the arrangement\r\nof the nervous system and in their vascular system, the Hirudinidæ\r\nresemble Annelida. The head in most of the Annelida is distinctly\r\nmarked, and furnished with eyes, tentacles, mouth, and teeth, and\r\nin some instances with auditory vesicles, containing otolithes. The\r\nnervous system consists of a series of ganglia running along the\r\nventral portion of the animal, and communicating with a central mass of\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n_Hirudina medicinalis_ puts forth a claim for special attention on\r\nthe ground of services rendered to mankind. The whole of the family\r\nlive by sucking the blood of other animals; and for this purpose the\r\nmouth of the leech is furnished with a number of strong horny teeth,\r\nby which they cut through the skin. In the common leech three rows of\r\nteeth exist, arranged in a triangular, or rather triradiate form, a\r\nstructure that accounts for the peculiar appearance of leech bites.\r\nThe most interesting part of the anatomy of the leech to microscopists\r\nis certainly the structure of the mouth (Fig. 380). This is a muscular\r\ndilatable orifice, within which three beautiful little semi-circular\r\nsaws are situated, arranged so that their edges meet in the centre. It\r\nis by means of these saws that the leech makes the incisions whence\r\nblood is to be procured, an operation which is performed in the\r\nfollowing manner. No sooner is the sucker firmly fixed to the skin,\r\nthan the mouth becomes slightly everted, and the edges of the saws are\r\nthus made to press upon the tense skin, a sawing movement being at the\r\nsame time given to each, whereby it is made gradually to pierce the\r\nsurface, and cut its way to the capillary blood-vessels beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.--Mouth of Leech.]\r\n\r\nIn Clepsinidæ the body is of a leech-like form, but very much narrowed\r\nin front, and the mouth is furnished with a prehensile proboscis. These\r\nanimals live in fresh water, where they may often be seen creeping over\r\naquatic plants. Their prey is the pond-snail.\r\n\r\n_Tubicola._--The worms belonging to this series of branchiferous\r\nAnnelida are all marine, and distinguished by their invariable habit\r\nof forming a tube or case, within which the soft parts of the animal\r\ncan be entirely retracted. This tube is usually attached to stones or\r\nother submarine bodies. Externally it is composed of various foreign\r\nmaterials, sand, crystalline bodies, and the _débris_ of shells;\r\ninternally it is lined with a smooth coating of sarcode, sometimes of a\r\nharder consistency. The Tubicola generally live in societies, winding\r\ntheir tubes into a mass which often attains a considerable size; only a\r\nfew are solitary in their habits. They retain their position in their\r\ncases by means of tufts of bristles and spines; the latter, in the\r\ntubicular Annelids, are usually hooked, so that by applying them to\r\nthe walls of the case, the animal is enabled to oppose a considerable\r\nresistance to any effort made to withdraw it. In the best known family\r\nof the order (Sabellia), the branchiæ are placed in the head, and form\r\na circle of plumes, or a tuft of branched organs. The Serpulidæ form\r\nirregularly twisted calcareous tubes, and often grow together in large\r\nmasses, when they secure themselves to shells and similar objects;\r\nother species, Terebellidæ, which build their cases of sand and stones,\r\nappear to prefer a life of solitude. The best known form is _Terebella\r\nlittoralis_.[79] The curious little spiral shells seen upon the fronds\r\nof seaweeds are formed by an animal belonging to the Spirorbis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381.--Serpula with extended tentacles and body\r\nprotruding from calcareous case.]\r\n\r\nIf the animals be placed in a vessel of sea-water a very pleasing\r\nspectacle will soon be witnessed. The top part of the tube is seen to\r\nopen, and the creature cautiously protrudes a fringe of tentacles;\r\nthese gradually spread out two beautiful fan-like rows of tentacles,\r\nsurrounded by cilia of a rich purple or red colour. These serve the\r\ndouble purpose of breathing and feeding organs. When withdrawn from its\r\ncalcareous case, the soft body is seen to be constructed of a series of\r\nrings, with a terminal prehensile foot by which it attaches itself.\r\n\r\nMany Annelids are without tubes or cells of any kind, simply burying\r\ntheir bodies in the sand near tidal mark. The Arenicola, lob-worm,\r\nis a well-known specimen of the class; its body is so transparent\r\nthat the circulating fluids can be distinctly seen under a moderate\r\nmagnifying power. Two kinds of fluids flow through the vessels, one\r\nnearly colourless, the other red; the vessels through which the latter\r\ncirculate are described as blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nNot very much interest attaches to the developmental stage of the\r\nAnnelida. They issue forth from ova, and the embryo so closely resemble\r\nciliated polypes, that competent observers have mistaken them for\r\nanimals belonging to a lower class; a few hours’ careful watching\r\nis sufficient to dispel a belief of the kind, when the embryonic,\r\nglobular, or shapeless mass is seen to assume a form of segmentation,\r\nand soon the various internal organs become more and more developed,\r\neye spots appear, and the young animal arrives at the adult stage of\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrustacea.\r\n\r\nThe crustaceans comprise a large assemblage of Arthropods, presenting\r\ngreat diversity of structure. Some of the parasitic species have\r\nbecome so simplified in organisation that they appear to present\r\nno relationship with the higher members of the class, yet it is\r\ncertain that all the species, whether terrestrial or aquatic, belong\r\nto the same stock, and may have had origin in the same fundamental\r\nplan of structure. Essentially, the body consists of a large number\r\nof segments, to each of which is attached a pair of two-branched\r\nappendages; the external branch is termed the exopodite and the\r\ninternal the endopodite. Five segments at the front end of the body\r\nunite to form a head, the appendages of the first two being situated in\r\nfront of the mouth, and performing the office of feelers or antennæ,\r\nwhile those of the remaining three segments are transformed into jaws,\r\nthe first pair of jaws being the mandibles and the following two\r\npairs the maxillæ. The rest of the appendages are variously modified\r\nand to some are attached respiratory organs in the form of gills.\r\nCrustaceans are broadly divided from Centipedes, Millipedes, Insects,\r\n&c., by the presence of two pairs instead of one pair of antennæ, and\r\nby the possession of branchial and not tubular (tracheal) respiratory\r\norgans. Arachnida and some other species are again widely separated.\r\nThe majority of the young on leaving the egg are quite unlike the\r\nparent, and only acquires their definite form after undergoing a series\r\nof changes. The earliest stage, which has been called the Nauplius,\r\nalready referred to in connection with the barnacle, is a minute body\r\nshowing no trace of segmentation, and provided with a single eye, and\r\nthree pairs of swimming appendages, which become the two pairs of\r\nantennæ and the mandibles of the adult. This stage is by no means of\r\ninvariable occurrence, but is chiefly characteristic of the lowest\r\nmembers, the Entomostraca, and is rare in the higher, Malacostraca. The\r\ntypical crustaceans are shrimps, crayfish, &c., so familiarly described\r\nby Huxley. The zoæa stage of the crab, a minute transparent creature,\r\nwhich undergoes several changes, swims about flapping its long jointed\r\nabdomen, like some of the Entomostraca, and the shrimp in particular.\r\nThe larva of crayfish, the so-called glass-crab, is very peculiar and\r\ninteresting. The sessile-eyed series, in which the compound eyes are\r\nnever mounted on a movable stalk, and to which the Isopoda belong,\r\nexhibits great diversity of structure as well as of habits and habitat.\r\nSome live in fresh water, most are marine, while others live on land\r\nand take to a parasitic life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382.--Male Gnathia, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThis genus contains Gnathia, in which the male and female are so\r\ndissimilar, that they are frequently referred to as members of two\r\nfamilies. In the adult male the mandibles are powerful and prominent,\r\nand the head is large, squared, and as wide as the thorax. In the\r\nfemale, on the contrary, the head is curiously small and triangular,\r\nwithout visible mandibles, and the thorax is much dilated. The\r\ncreatures are about one-sixth of an inch long, and of a greyish colour,\r\nand the destruction they bring about is due to their habit of boring\r\ninto timber below water mark. Fig. 382 represents an enlarged view\r\nof the male Gnathia. These crustaceans are vegetarians, and feed on\r\nwood. Other members of the group, known as fish lice, are much larger\r\nin size, and chiefly infest the cetacea, and bear in addition two\r\nlarge eyes. By means of their powerful fore feet the Cymothordæ attach\r\nthemselves to both marine and fresh-water fish, showing a preference\r\nfor the inside of the mouth of their host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383.--1. Cypris; 2. Cyclops; 3. _Branchipus\r\ngrubei_.]\r\n\r\nThe bar-footed group Copepoda are free living, and the thorax bears\r\nfour or five swimming feet; the abdomen is without appendages. The best\r\nknown fresh-water form is Cyclops, the structure of which serves as\r\na type of the order. The body is, as is well known to microscopists,\r\nbroad in front and tapering behind, being thus, when viewed swimming,\r\npear-shaped in outline. The dorsal elements of the head are fused to\r\nform a carapace, which bears a single eye, from which circumstance it\r\nderives its name. The eggs are carried by the female in a couple of\r\nova-sacs attached to the last segment of the thorax, and so prolific\r\nare these creatures that a female will produce over four thousand\r\nmillion young. The young when hatched is an oval Nauplius, which after\r\ntwo or three moults acquires the adult state. In the family of the\r\nApodidæ we have an equally well-known crustacean, the Branchipus.\r\nIn the Branchipodidæ the body is also elongated, but there are no\r\nappendages to the abdomen, which consists of nine segments, while\r\nthere are eleven pairs of thoracic appendages. The head shield is not\r\ndeveloped backwards, and the large separated eyes are supported on\r\ndistinct stalks. In the male the second antennæ are converted into\r\nclaspers. These crustaceans swim upside down (Fig. 383).\r\n\r\n=Cladocera= (_Daphniadæ_ of Dr. Baird).--The water-flea (_Daphnia\r\npulex_) may be taken as the best known example of the order. The\r\nbody of this little active animal is narrowed in front, and at the\r\nposterior end, where the carapace is deeply notched, is the tip of the\r\nabdomen bearing the pair of rigid barbed setæ from which the genus\r\ntakes its name. At the front of the head is a large compound eye and\r\ntwo pairs of branched plumed appendages, antennæ. The first pair of\r\nthese are small and simple. The jaws consist of the mandibles and the\r\nfirst pair of maxillæ, the second pair of maxillæ being obsolete in\r\nthe adult. The thorax comprises five segments, each bearing a pair of\r\nleaf-like swimming limbs. The abdomen consists of three segments, and\r\nis destitute of limbs. The males are usually smaller than the females,\r\nand much rarer, being rarely met with before the end of summer.\r\n\r\nEggs are laid both in summer and winter, and are passed into a\r\nbrood-pouch, separating the upper surface of the thorax from the\r\nbackward extension of the carapace. Here the summer eggs hatch, but\r\nthe winter set are enclosed in a kind of capsule developed from the\r\ncarapace. This capsule, termed the _ephippium_, is cast off with the\r\nnext moult of the mother’s integument (a process necessary for the\r\ngradual growth of the crustacean), and falling to the bottom of the\r\nwater, gives exit to the embryos, which hatch in its interior, and the\r\nyoung born from these “ephippial” eggs produce young, which in their\r\nturn become mothers. It appears, then, the winter eggs are enclosed\r\nin capsules of more than usual hardness to enable them to withstand\r\nany degree of cold that might otherwise prove fatal to the parent.\r\nDr. Baird found, on examining ponds that had been again filled up by\r\nrain after remaining two months dry, numerous specimens of Daphnia and\r\n_Cyclops quadricornis_ in all stages of growth.[80]\r\n\r\nWe learn also from his investigations that the Daphnia have many\r\nenemies. “The larva of the _Corethra plumicornis_, known to\r\nmicroscopical observers as the skeleton larva, is exceedingly rapacious\r\nof Daphnia. Pritchard says they are the choice food of a species\r\nof Nais; and Dr. Parnell states that the Lochleven trout owes its\r\nsuperior sweetness and richness of flavour to its food, which consists\r\nof small shell-fish and Entomostraca.” These crustaceans abound in\r\nfresh and salt water. Artemiæ are formed exclusively in salt water, in\r\nsalt marshes, and in water highly charged with salt. Myriads of these\r\nEntomostraca are found in the salterns at Lymington, in the open tanks\r\nor reservoirs where the brine is deposited previous to boiling. A pint\r\nof the fluid contains about a quarter of a pound of salt, and this\r\nconcentrated solution destroys most other marine animals. During the\r\nfine days in summer Artemiæ may be observed in immense numbers near\r\nthe surface of the water, and, as they are frequently of a lively red\r\ncolour, the water appears tinged with the same hue. The movements of\r\nthis little animal are peculiar. It swims about on its back, and by\r\nmeans of its tail, its feet being at the same time in constant motion.\r\nThey are both oviparous and ovoviviparous, according to the season of\r\nthe year. At certain periods they only lay eggs, while during the hot\r\nsummer months they produce their young alive. In about fifteen days\r\nthe eggs are expelled in numbers varying from 50 to 150. As is the\r\ncase with many of the Entomostraca, the young present a very different\r\nappearance from the adult animals; and they are so exactly like the\r\nyoung of _Chirocephalus_, that with difficulty are they distinguishable\r\none from the other. The ova of other species are furnished with\r\nthick capsules, and imbedded in a dark opaque substance, presenting\r\na minutely cellular appearance, and occupying the interspace between\r\nthe body of the animal and the back of the shell; this is called the\r\nephippium. The shell is often beautifully transparent, sometimes\r\nspotted with pigment; it consists of a substance known as chitine,\r\nimpregnated with a variable amount of calcium carbonate, which produces\r\na copious effervescence on the addition of a small quantity of a strong\r\nacid to the water in which the shell is immersed. When boiled, Artemiæ\r\nturn red as their congeners, lobsters. Their shells may be said to\r\nconsist of two valves united at the back, resembling the bivalve shell\r\nof a mussel, or simply folded at the back to appear like a bivalve,\r\nbut are really not so; or they may consist of a number of rings or\r\nsegments. The body of Cypris presents a reticulated appearance,\r\nsomewhat resembling cell structure. Entomostraca should be narcotised\r\nand prepared for examination under the microscope as directed by Mr.\r\nRousselet at pages 345, 346.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS’ EGGS, ETC.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.       Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nArthropoda--Insecta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distinctive Characters of Insects._--The term Insect, although\r\noriginally and according to the meaning of the word correctly employed\r\nin a wide sense to embrace all those articulate creatures in which\r\nthe body is externally divided into a number of segments, including,\r\nof course, flies, butterflies, beetles, bugs, spiders, scorpions,\r\ncrabs, shrimps, &c., is now by common consent used in a much more\r\nrestricted sense to apply only to such of these animals as have\r\nsix walking legs. Insects belong to a class of Arthropoda, and are\r\ndistinguished by having the head, chest, and abdomen distinctly marked\r\nout and separable; by having not more than three pairs of legs in the\r\nadult state; by having the legs borne by the thoracic segments only;\r\nby having usually two pairs of wings; by the possession of tracheæ,\r\nor air-tubes, as respiratory organs; and by being provided with a\r\nsingle pair of antennæ, or feelers. The insect class is one exhibiting\r\nuniformity of type and structure. Extreme variations are no doubt seen\r\nwithin certain limits, but these variations are sharply marked off\r\nfrom the groups we have been previously considering. The examination\r\nof insects may be pursued according to a defined order, and it will\r\nbe found that no class of animals will afford the microscopist a more\r\nwonderful field of observation and a greater variety of interesting\r\nobjects than that of the insect tribes.\r\n\r\nIn the insect, as in the crustacean, the hard parts of the body form\r\nan outer and protecting covering, and also serve for the attachment\r\nof muscles. The casing, however, in insects is purely of a chitinous,\r\nor horny nature, and has in its composition only a trace of calcium\r\ncarbonate. Each somite, or joint of the body, is usually composed of\r\nsix pieces; the upper, or dorsal half of each segment is named the\r\ntergum, the lower half the sternum, the side pieces pleura, the sternum\r\nbeing further sub-divided into epimeral and espisternal pieces. The\r\nbody as a whole consists of some twenty segments, of which five or six\r\nform the head, the thorax of three joints, while the abdomen may number\r\nfrom nine to eleven. The head segments are united to form apparently\r\na single mass, and the appendages of this region are modified for\r\nsensory purposes, and also serve as cutting and masticatory organs. The\r\nappendages of the head, examined in order, will be found to consist\r\nof eyes, antennæ, or feelers, and organs of the mouth. The antennæ of\r\ninsects rarely exceed two in number, but these present great variations\r\nin form and size. In their simplest form they exist as straight jointed\r\nfilaments, but in many insects they are forked, in others club-shaped,\r\nwhile in others they mimic forms of vegetation, and for the most part\r\nare extremely interesting objects for the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384.--Vertical section of cornea of Eye of Fly.]\r\n\r\nThe principal use of these antennæ is that of organs of touch, but\r\nit is quite probable that they may subserve other functions, as of\r\ntaste or even hearing. The eyes of insects consist of either a pair of\r\n_ocelli_, or of a great number, when they are termed compound eyes,\r\nformed of an aggregation of external hexagonal facets and lenses, and\r\nnerve filaments, all of which have a distinct connection with the mass\r\nof ganglia recognised as the brain, as will be seen in Fig. 384, a\r\nsection of the eye of a fly. The number of facets varies very greatly\r\nin these compound eyes; ants, for example, have fifty facets, flies\r\ntwo thousand or more, and butterflies as many. Dr. Hooke counted seven\r\nthousand, and Leuwenhoeck as many as twelve thousand in the eye of a\r\ndragon fly. The eyes of some insects are supported on short stalks or\r\npedicles, but these are never movable, as, for example, in Stalk-eyed\r\ncrustaceans.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the mouth in insects present a striking homology or\r\nsimilarity in their fundamental structure. Two chief types of mouth are\r\nfound. The biting or masticatory, as in beetles, includes a labium or\r\nupper lip, a pair of mandibles or lower jaws, a pair of lesser jaws\r\nor maxillæ, which bear one or two pairs of palpi, and a lower lip or\r\nlabium, also with palpi. This latter and primitive condition of the\r\nlabium is seen in Orthropterous insects and some Neuroptera. Other\r\nstructures occurring in those of the mouth are the ligula, this being\r\nsometimes divided, as in bees, into three lobes, of which the two\r\nouter are the paraglossæ and the middle process the lingua or tongue.\r\nThere is a second form of mouth, termed the suctorial. This is seen in\r\nLepidoptera (butterflies), and is adapted for extracting the pollen and\r\njuices of flowers, and in which the palpi are greatly developed, and\r\nform two hairy pads or cushions, between which the proboscis is coiled\r\nup when at rest. Thus we find in the Lepidoptera the same fundamental\r\ncondition of mouth as in some Coleoptera. In Hymenoptera (wasps and\r\nbees), a variety of mouth is found which presents a combination of\r\nthe masticatory with the suctorial types. The labium and mandibles\r\nexist as in the beetle, the maxillæ being developed to form long\r\nsheaths protecting the labium, which now takes the form of a tongue.\r\nIn Hemiptera (bugs and their allies), the mandibles and maxillæ exist\r\nas sharp lancets, while the labium forms a protective sheath. In the\r\nDiptera (flies, gnats, &c.), the labium undergoes a great development,\r\nand forms a very prominent tongue, the other parts of the mouth being\r\ndeveloped simply as sheaths to the labium. See Figs. 389 and 390.\r\n\r\nThe thorax or chest of insects consists of three segments, named from\r\nbefore backwards: the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. The first\r\nbears the anterior pair of legs; the mesothorax, the second pair of\r\nlegs and the first pair of wings; and the metathorax, the third pair of\r\nlegs and second pair of wings. The last joints of the leg constitute\r\nthe tarsus or foot-claws. The nervures of the wings are in reality\r\nhollow tubes, and are extensions of the spiracles, or respiratory\r\napertures.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of insects lie concealed beneath the integument; they are\r\nnot gathered into distinct bundles as in the higher animals, although\r\nthey exhibit in many cases a striated or striped structure. This is\r\nwell seen in some of the beetle tribe, the water-beetle in particular.\r\nIn certain larvæ the muscles are exceedingly complicated. Lyonnet found\r\nin the larva of the goat-moth, two hundred and twenty-eight muscles in\r\nthe head alone, and in the whole body no less than three thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-three. The muscular power of insects is, relatively\r\nto the size of the body, very great. The flea, for instance, leaps two\r\nhundred times its own height. There are beetles weighing a few grammes\r\nthat will escape from a pressure of from twenty to thirty ounces.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schäfer infers that the structure of the wing-muscles of\r\ninsects furnishes the key to the comprehension of the more intricate\r\nmuscular structure of vertebrates. The sarcode element, however, is\r\nnot made up of a bundle of rods, but of a continuous sarcous element,\r\nreadily made out by staining with hæmatoxylin. This substance is then\r\nseen to be pierced by minute tubular canals, and the longitudinal\r\nstriation of muscle is due to this canalisation. The whole is connected\r\nand enclosed by a membrane of extreme delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe digestive system of insects varies with their habits and food.\r\nIn Stylops, bee-parasites, and in young bees living on fluids, the\r\nintestine ends in a blind sac. There are three coats of structure\r\nthroughout the digestive system. The œsophagus or gullet is provided\r\nwith a crop in flies, bees, and butterflies; a true analogue of the\r\ngizzard in birds. There is in some respects a curious likeness between\r\nthe conformation of the digestive organs of birds and that of insects.\r\nNo true liver, but salivary glands in the mouth have been made out;\r\nthe heart lies dorsally, and consists of a pulsating sac divided into\r\ncompartments, and the fluid flows through it towards the head, whence\r\nit circulates freely to other parts of the body. Each trachea is an\r\nelastic tube formed of two delicate membranes, between which the spiral\r\nfilament is coiled up, and is of sufficient density to prevent the\r\ncollapse of the tube by the movements of the body. These tracheæ are\r\ndistributed throughout the muscular tissue and the whole of the body.\r\nThus the insect, like the bird, may be said to breathe in every part\r\nof the body, and is in this way rendered light and buoyant for flight.\r\nThe air is admitted to the tracheæ by apertures termed spiracles, which\r\nthe insect can close at will, and these are distributed to the number\r\nof eleven on each side of the body. The nervous system consists of a\r\nchain of ganglia or nerve-knots, which unite towards the head to form a\r\nsingle cord, as seen in the section made through the spider (Fig. 409).\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of all insects takes place by ova, and they are\r\ndiæceous--that is, have two distinct sexes. In some few instances,\r\nas that of Aphides, or plant-lice, we have the peculiar phenomenon\r\nof parthenogenesis, the process of reproduction being performed by\r\nimperfect wingless females. These bring forth living young ones, which\r\nbegin to feed the moment they are born, and constitute a viviparous\r\nbrood; in other cases females lay eggs, and the process proceeds in the\r\nordinary way, and nearly all the year round. The former is provided\r\nwith a lancet-like beak for piercing and sucking the juices of the\r\nleaf, and a pair of curious honey-tubes. Insects generally undergo a\r\ntransformation or metamorphosis in passing from the egg to the adult\r\nstage. While within the egg the body may be seen to become segmented,\r\nand in the course of time--in such insects as flies, bees, beetles,\r\nand butterflies--issue forth from the egg as larvæ, or caterpillars.\r\nThis worm-like creature makes for itself an investing case or cocoon,\r\nin which it passes into the pupa stage of its existence. Within the\r\npupa case a wonderful transformation takes place; the larval body\r\nbeing literally broken down by the process of histolysis, while its\r\nelements are rebuilt and transformed into that of the _imago_, or\r\nperfect insect. In grasshoppers, crickets, dragon-flies, bugs, &c.,\r\nthe metamorphosis is incomplete (hemimetabolic). Some few lower insect\r\nforms (lice, spring-tails, &c.) undergo no change of the kind, and\r\nin no way differ from the adult except in size. These are termed\r\nametabolic insects. Others again, as the cockchafer and gold beetle,\r\npass three years in the larval stage. Development in all cases is\r\narrested or retarded by cold. Reaumur kept a butterfly pupa for two\r\nyears in an ice-house, and it exhibited no tendency towards a change\r\nuntil removed to a warm temperature.\r\n\r\nFrom the short natural history of insect life I have endeavoured to\r\nsketch out, it will have been surmised that insects offer a wide field\r\nof research, and an almost endless number of objects of interest for\r\nthe microscope. The variety of material is great, and the structure and\r\nadaptation of means to an end is of the most fascinating kind. Most\r\ncabinets abound in preparations gathered together with some care and\r\nmounted with all the skill at the command of the collector, affording,\r\nas a rule, as endless an amount of pleasure to the tyro as to the more\r\npractised entomologist. It may be surmised, then, that to enter fully\r\ninto a description of the several parts of insect structure would\r\nrequire a volume[81] of very large bulk, and occupy months and years.\r\nI will, therefore, take some points of interest in the structural\r\ncharacteristics of insects, and take them in the order in which\r\nthey have already been brought to notice. The head, eyes, and other\r\nappendages of these insects we are more or less acquainted with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 385.--A tangential or side section of Eye of Fly, with palp or\r\npads protruded.]\r\n\r\nWe will take for examination a typical member of Muscidæ, a family\r\nembracing a large and varied assortment of species, among which\r\nthe house-fly and the blow-fly are the best known forms. _Musca\r\ndomestica_ needs no description. An interesting part of the house-fly\r\nto the microscopist is the wonderful component parts of the head. On\r\nexamination we find a couple of protuberances, more or less prominent,\r\nand situated symmetrically one on each side. Their outline at the base\r\nis for the most part oval, elliptical, circular, or truncated; while\r\ntheir curved surfaces are spherical, spheroidal, or pyriform. These\r\nhorny, round, and naked parts are the corneæ of the compound eye of the\r\nfly, and they are appropriately so termed, from the analogy they bear\r\nto the larger transparent tunics in the higher classes of animals. They\r\ndiffer, however, from the latter, as when viewed by the microscope they\r\ndisplay a large number of hexagonal facets, which constitute the medium\r\nfor the admission of light to several hundred simple eyes. Under an\r\nordinary lens, and by reflected light, the entire surface of one cornea\r\npresents a beautiful reticulation, like very fine wire gauze, with\r\nminute papilla, or at least a slight elevation, in the centre of each\r\nmesh. These are resolved, however, by the aid of a compound microscope,\r\nand with a power of from 80 to 100 diameters, into an almost incredible\r\nnumber (when compared with the space they occupy) of minute, regular,\r\ngeometrical hexagons, well defined, and capable of being computed\r\nwith tolerable ease, their exceeding minuteness being taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFig. 386 represents a vertical section of the eye, showing the\r\nhexagonal faceted arrangement of cylindrical tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.--Section of Eye of Fly.\r\n\r\n_l._ Lenses; _co._ Cones; _pl._ Pigment layer, consisting of rings\r\nround the rods; _r.r._ Rods; _a.v^1._ Air vessels between the rods;\r\n_m^1._ Membrane on which the rods and air vessels rest; _a.v^2._\r\nShorter lengths of air vessels which form a layer above the first nerve\r\njunction; _n.j^1._ First nerve junction; _m^2._ Membrane on which it\r\nstands; A.

(Magnified × 160.)]\r\n\r\nIn this section it appears to be questionable whether the normal\r\nshape of the lenses is not round, assuming the hexagonal shape during\r\nthe process of growth in consequence of their agglomeration. The\r\ncorneal surface can be peeled off, and if carefully flattened out and\r\nmounted it will be seen that each lens is not a simple lens, but a\r\ndouble-convex compound one, composed of two plano-convex lenses of\r\ndifferent densities or refracting power joined together.\r\n\r\nExperiments made on the eyes of insects, and also of crustaceæ, show\r\nthat in the insect a real and reversed image of external bodies is\r\nformed in each ommatidium; it coincides with the internal face of\r\nthe crystalline cone in immediate contact with the retina. Although\r\nsmall, the retinal image is distinct and subtends an angle of nearly\r\nforty-five. In the same way in the crustacean, the crystalline lens\r\nforms on the retinula a reversed image, but the refractive media\r\nhave a longer focus, and the retinal membrane is not connected with\r\nthe lens, the interval being filled up by a substance analogous to\r\nthe vitreous of vertebrates. In both cases it would appear that light\r\ndoes not act directly on the rods; these latter can only receive\r\nimpressions through the intermediary retinal cells. The retinal images\r\nof arthropods, as might have been surmised, are much less perfect than\r\nthose of the higher orders; on the other hand, their eyes seem to\r\nbe better adapted for seeing objects in relief and the movements of\r\nbodies. The shyness of butterflies and moths is certainly an inherited\r\ninstinct as a protection against danger from their many enemies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387.\r\n\r\nA. Vertical section of Eye of _Melolontha vulgans_, Cockchafer; B. A\r\nfew facets more highly magnified, showing facets and pigment layer.]\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying Fig. 387, A is a vertical section of the eye\r\nof _Melolontha vulgans_, the fan-like arrangement of the facets,\r\ntogether with the transparent pyramidal gathering of the retinal rods\r\nproceeding towards the brain; B is a few of the corneal tubes more\r\nhighly magnified, the darker portion representing the pigment layer\r\nof the corneal tubes. In Plate VI., No. 133, the under surface of the\r\nhead and mouth of the “Tsetse” fly, _Glossina morsitans_, is shown.\r\nThe proboscis of this fly is long and prominent, and the antennæ\r\nare peculiar, inasmuch as the third segment is long, and produced\r\nalmost as far as the flagellum, which is furnished with barbed hairs\r\nalong its outer surface only. Although this fly barely equals the\r\nblow-fly in size, it is one of the greatest pests to the domestic\r\ncattle of Equatorial Africa. The palpi, although arising from two\r\nroots, are seen joined together when the fly is at rest, but when in\r\nthe act of piercing or sucking they divide and the sheath is thrown\r\ndirectly upwards. The palpi are furnished on their convex sides with\r\nlong and sharply-pointed dark-brown setæ or hairs, while the inner\r\nconcave sides, which are brought into contact with the proboscis, are\r\nperfectly smooth and fleshy. Three circular openings seem to indicate\r\nthe tubular nature of what in the house-fly is a fleshy, expanded,\r\nand highly-developed muscular proboscis (seen in Fig. 388, _Musca\r\ndomestica_). The proboscis (labium) forms the chief part of the organ,\r\ndilates into wonderful muscular lips, and enables the insect to employ\r\nthe tongue as a prehensile organ. The lips are covered with rows of\r\nminute setæ, directed a little backwards and arranged rather closely\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388.--Proboscis of House-fly, _Musca domestica_.\r\n(The small circle indicates the object about the natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThere are very many rows of these minute hairs on each of the lips,\r\nand from being arranged in a similar direction are employed by the\r\ninsect in scraping or tearing delicate surfaces. These hairs are tests\r\nfor the best of high powers. It is by means of these that it teases\r\nhuman beings in the heat of summer, when it alights on the hand or\r\nface, to sip the perspiration as it exudes from the skin. The fluid\r\nascends the proboscis, partly by a sucking action, assisted by the\r\nmuscles of the lips themselves, which are of a spiral form, arranged\r\naround a highly elastic, tendinous, and ligamentous structure, with\r\nother retractile additions for rapidity and facility of motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 389.--Spiral structure of Tongue of House-fly, from a\r\nmicro-photograph made with a Zeiss 16 mm. and apochromatic projection\r\neye-piece × 150.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful form of the spiral structure of the tongue should be\r\nviewed under a high magnifying power, when it will be seen that no\r\ncontinuing spiral structure really exists; each ring, apparently\r\ndetached, does not extend quite round; their action is that of sucking\r\ntubes. Fluids are evidently drawn up through the entire fissure caused\r\nby the opening between the ends of the whole series of rings. It may\r\nwell be pronounced a marvellous structure. The mounting of the tongue\r\nmust be done with a considerable amount of care to show this structure,\r\nimperfectly represented in my woodcut.\r\n\r\nThese insects are of some service in the economy of nature, by their\r\nconsumption of decaying animal matter, found about in quantities\r\nordinarily imperceptible to most people, and that would not be removed\r\nby ordinary means during hot weather. It was asserted by Linnæus that\r\nthree flies would consume a dead horse as quickly as a lion. This\r\nwas, of course, said with reference to the offspring of such three\r\nflies; and it is quite possible the assertion may be correct, since\r\nthe young begin to eat as soon as hatched, and a female blow-fly will\r\nproduce twenty thousand living larvæ (one of which is represented in\r\nPlate VI., No. 141). In twenty-four hours, each will have increased in\r\nweight two hundred times, in five days it attains to its full size, and\r\nchanges into the pupa, and then to the perfect insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONGUE OF DRONE-FLY.\r\n\r\nFig. 390.--Tongue, Proboscis, and piercing apparatus of Drone-fly\r\n(_Eristalis tenax_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391.--Under-surface of a Wasp’s Tongue, Feelers,\r\n&c. (Seen within the circle is the tongue about life-size.)]\r\n\r\nIn the drone-fly (_Eristalis tenax)_, the mouth organs are larger\r\nthan in the house-fly, and differ in many respects. The tongue is\r\nsplit up for a certain distance, and then again united, as represented\r\nin Fig. 390. The labium, mandibles, and maxillæ are converted into\r\nwell-developed lancet-shaped organs; these both pierce the skin of\r\nanimals, and form tubes by which their blood may be sucked up. Next\r\nto the maxillary palpi a couple of lancets are seen to project out;\r\nthese again are associated with two other instruments, one resembling\r\nin appearance a two-edged sword, and a peculiar one with pincers or\r\ncutting teeth at the extremity. It is very peculiar, and resembles\r\nan instrument used in surgery for enlarging the wound, and in this\r\ncase to increase the flow of blood. This remarkable compound piercing\r\napparatus of the drone-fly is of exquisite finish, and must strike\r\nthe observer with amazement, while it greatly transcends the work of\r\nhuman mechanism. The fleshy tongue itself projects some distance from\r\nthe apparatus described, and is furnished with setæ or hairs, shorter\r\nand fewer in number than those of the house-fly, and while its spiral\r\nstructure is not so fully developed, its retractor, muscles, and\r\nligaments are even more so.\r\n\r\nThe further development of the mouth organs must be looked for in other\r\nmembers of the insect tribe, when it will be seen many assume a more or\r\nless modified form of structure, that, for example, in Hymenoptera (the\r\nbee and wasp), in which insects the mouth and tongue are divided into\r\nlobes which are used to extract the nectary (as Linnæus termed it) from\r\nthe plants on which they feed. The tongue in most species is capable of\r\nextension and contraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.\r\n\r\n1. Sting of Wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_), with its muscular attachments and\r\npalpi for cleansing the apparatus; 2. Sting of Bee.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 391 the under-surface of the wasp’s tongue is shown, together\r\nwith its two pairs of antennæ, and pair of brushes on either side, for\r\nbrushing off the gathered pollen and honey from the broad tongue. It is\r\namply provided with muscular structure. The antennæ, or feelers, are as\r\ncurious in form as they are delicate in structure. Those of the male\r\ndiffer from those of the female.\r\n\r\nBoth the bee and the wasp are armed with an exceedingly venomous\r\nsting, as is well known. This structure takes the form of a\r\nwell-adapted mechanical contrivance, and is a weapon of offence as\r\nwell as of defence. The sting consists of two barbed needle-points,\r\nof a sufficient length to pierce the flesh to some depth. From the\r\npeculiar arrangement of their serrated edges their immediate withdrawal\r\ncannot take place, and it is this circumstance, with the drop of\r\npoison injected into the open wound, that renders their sting of the\r\nmost painful and irritating kind. The gland containing the poison\r\nis contained in a minute sac situated at the root of the piercing\r\napparatus. In Fig. 392 is shown the sting of the wasp and the bee.\r\n\r\nVery many insects are provided with instruments for boring into the\r\nbark or solid wood itself. The female Cynip bores into the oak-apple\r\nfor the purpose of depositing her egg. The larva, when full grown, eats\r\nits way out of the nut, and drops to the ground, where it attains the\r\nform of the perfect fly (Fig. 393).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393.--Female Gall-fly and Larva.]\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of species living exclusively upon the leaves of\r\nplants, to which they do much damage by the excrescences or galls they\r\nform. Each tree seems to be infested by its own species of gall-mite,\r\nthe so-called _nail-gall_ of the lime being caused by a species named\r\n_Phytoptus tibiæ_. These galls take the form of a pointed column,\r\nstanding erect on the upper side of the leaf. Galls of much the same\r\nstructure occur in the sycamore, maple, elm, and various fruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe gnat (_Culex pipiens_) is furnished with a sting curiously\r\nconstructed (Fig. 394), and enclosed in a perfectly clothed sheath\r\ncovered throughout by scales or feathers. This is folded up when not in\r\nuse. The mouth is provided with a complete set of lancets for piercing\r\nthe flesh; after having inflicted a severe wound, it injects an acid\r\npoison through the proboscis. The scales of the gnat vary in structure\r\naccordingly as these are found on the wing, the body, or the proboscis.\r\nA magnified wing is shown at No. 2, Fig. 394, and a magnified scale\r\nfrom the proboscis at No. 3. In Fig. 405, Nos. 3 and 5, more highly\r\nmagnified wing and body scales are given. The proboscis is protected on\r\neither side by antennæ and feelers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394.\r\n\r\n1. Head of _Culex pipiens_, female Gnat, detached from body; 2. Wing,\r\nshowing nervature and fringed edges; 3. Scale from Proboscis; 4.\r\nProboscis and Lancets. The reticulated markings on each side of the\r\nhead show the proportionate space occupied by the eyes.]\r\n\r\nThe giant-tailed wasp, _Sirax gigas_, is furnished with an even more\r\ncurious mechanical boring apparatus (Fig. 395) than its congeners.\r\nThis is a boring ovipositor, skilfully contrived for piercing the bark\r\nof trees, in which the insect deposits her eggs, and where the larva,\r\nwhen hatched, will find an ample supply of food to carry it through\r\nthis stage of existence. The boring tube, it will be seen, is a perfect\r\nmuscular structure (_c_, _c_, _a_, and _x_); in short, it is an endless\r\nform of drill, well known to the mechanic, such as is employed in fine\r\nwork for drilling holes. The females are of some size, and may be\r\nsurprised and taken in the act of boring through the bark of the pine\r\ntree, for which they have a preference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 395.--Boring apparatus of Giant-tailed Wasp (_Sirex gigas_), ×\r\n350.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a species of the broad-bodied saw-fly, _Lyda campestris_.\r\nThese bore the Scotch fir, and deposit their eggs. The larvæ from these\r\neggs, when hatched out, feed upon the pine-needles, first spinning\r\na fine web to conceal their work of depredation. A better known\r\nsaw-fly, _Abraxas grossulariata_, plays havoc among our gooseberry\r\ntrees. The female is provided with a curious mechanical apparatus as\r\nan ovipositor, with which she cuts into the thicker under-leaf of the\r\nplant. This penetrating and cutting tool consists of a double-saw (Fig.\r\n396) of elaborate construction, which when not in use is kept concealed\r\nin a long narrow case situated beneath the abdomen. It is further\r\nprotected by two horny plates. The saws pass out through a deep groove\r\nso arranged that the saws work side by side backwards and forwards,\r\nwithout a possibility of running out of the groove. When the cut is\r\nmade, the four are drawn together and form a central canal, through\r\nwhich an egg is forced into the leaf. The cutting edges of the saws are\r\nprovided with about eighteen or twenty teeth; these have sharp points\r\nof extreme delicacy, and together make a serrated edge of the exact\r\nform given to the finest and best-made surgical saws of the present\r\nday. In the summer-time the proceedings of the female insect may be\r\nwitnessed, and the method of using this curious instrument seen, by the\r\naid of a hand magnifier. These insects are not easily alarmed when busy\r\nat work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.--Saws of the Gooseberry-fly (_Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata_).]\r\n\r\nBefore bringing my remarks on proboscides of insects to a conclusion,\r\nattention must be given to that of the honey bee (_Apis mellifica_),\r\nand its curious accessories. The mouth of bees exhibits a combination\r\nof the suctorial and the masticatory form of oral apparatus. Thus\r\nthe labial, or upper lip, and the mandibles, or large pair of jaws,\r\nare well developed, while the maxillæ, or lesser pair, are elongated\r\nto form a tubular organ, through which, together with the tongue,\r\nthe flower juices, “honey-dew,” may be sucked up. The labium, lower\r\nlip, is also rather prolonged, and the palpi, or organs of touch,\r\nwith which it is endowed form a useful protective apparatus. The\r\nmandibles are employed by bees in the construction of their abodes,\r\nwhile the suctorial portion of the mouth is devoted to the reception\r\nof nourishment and to prehension. The sting of the bee, already\r\nnoticed, is in fact an ovipositor, the female alone being provided\r\nwith this weapon as an egg-depositing organ, although better known\r\nas an _aculeus_ or sting; but it forms no part of the oral apparatus\r\n(as shown in Fig. 397). The proboscis itself will be seen to be\r\ncuriously divided; the divisions are elegant and regular, beset\r\nwith numerous setæ or hairs. The two horny outside lancets are\r\nspear-shaped and partially set with short hairs; at the base of each is\r\na hinge articulation; this permits of considerable motion in several\r\ndirections, and is much used by the busy insect for forcing open the\r\nmore internal parts of flowers, thus facilitating the introduction\r\nof the proboscis. The two shorter feelers are closely connected with\r\nthe proboscis, and terminate in three-jointed articulations. The\r\nstructure of the proboscis is so arranged that it can be enlarged\r\nat the base, and thus made to contain a greater quantity of the\r\ncollected honey-dew; at the same time it is in this cavity the nectar\r\nappears to be converted into pure honey. The proboscis tapers off to a\r\nlittle nipple-like extremity, and at its base is seen two shorter and\r\nstronger mandibles, from between which is protruded a long and narrow\r\nlance-like tongue, the whole being most curiously connected by a series\r\nof strong muscles and ligaments. The basal or first joint of the hind\r\nleg in the neuter or working bee is developed into an enlarged form of\r\npocket, used by the insect for conveying the pollen of flowers and the\r\npropolis to the hive. Indeed, both the tibia and the first joint of the\r\ntarsus are broadened out into plates, but the two sides of the plates\r\nare differently furnished. On one side is a thick coating of hairs,\r\nthose on the tarsus taking the form of a brush, evidently used for\r\nbrushing out the pollen, as these special developments are not found on\r\nthe hind legs of the drones or of the queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397.\r\n\r\n1. Honey bee’s tongue; 2. Leg of worker bee. (The small circles show\r\nthe objects about the natural size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398.\r\n\r\n1. Foot and leg of Ophion; 2. Foot and leg of Flesh-fly; 3. Foot and\r\nleg of Drone-fly, with pad or sucker appendage.]\r\n\r\nThe wax used in the formation of cells is a secretion that exudes\r\nthrough certain portions of the body of the bee, since it is found in\r\nlittle pouches situated on the under part of the body, but it is not\r\nbrought home ready for use. The walls of the cells are strengthened\r\nwhen completed by a kind of varnish, already referred to as the\r\npropolis, collected from the buds of poplar and lime trees, and this\r\nis spread over the walls of the cell by that wonderful pair of broad\r\nspatulæ, represented in the drawing.\r\n\r\nMany interesting variations will be found in the legs and feet of\r\nflies, as well as in those of other orders of insects (Lepidoptera).\r\nOne or two typical forms are represented in Plate VI., and in Fig. 398.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 399.--Sucker on the leg of Water-beetle. (The dot in the circle\r\nrepresents the object natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThe tarsus, or foot of the fly (Fig. 398), consists of a deeply bifid,\r\nmembranous structure, _pulvillus_; anterior to its attachment to the\r\nfifth tarsal joint, or the upper surface, are seated two claws, or\r\n“tarsal ungues”; these are freely movable in every direction. These\r\nungues differ greatly in their outline, size, and relative development\r\nto the tarsi, and to the bodies of the insects possessing them,\r\nand in their covering; most are naked over their entire surface,\r\nhaving however a hexagonal network at their bases, which indicates a\r\nrudimentary condition of minute scale-like hairs, such as are common\r\non some part of the integument of all insects. Flexor and extensor\r\nmuscles are attached to both ungues and flaps; the flaps are either\r\ncorrugated or arranged on the ridge and furrow plan, in other cases\r\nthey are perfectly smooth on their free surface, while others are\r\ncovered with minute scale-like hairs. The thickness of the divided\r\nmembrane on the blow-fly does not exceed the 1/2000th of an inch at\r\nthe margin; they somewhat increase in thickness towards the point of\r\nattachment. Projecting from the flap are organs which have been termed\r\n“hairs,” “hair-like appendages,” “trumpet-shaped hairs.” These are\r\ndoubtless the immediate agents in holding on to a smooth surface, as\r\nthat of glass, and are termed “tenent-hairs,” in allusion to their\r\noffice. The under surface of left forefoot of _Musca vomitoria_ is\r\nshown with tenent-hairs (Plate VI., No. 140); _a_ and _b_ are more\r\nmagnified hairs, _a_ from below, _b_ from the side. No. 142 is the\r\nleft forefoot of _Amara communis_, showing the under surface and form\r\nof tenent appendages, one of which is seen more magnified at _a_; No.\r\n143, under surface of left forefoot, _Ephydra riparia_. This fly is\r\nmet with in immense numbers on the surface water in salt marshes. It\r\ndoes not possess the power of climbing glass; this is explained by the\r\nstructure of the tenent-hairs; the central tactile organ is also very\r\npeculiar, the whole acting as a float, one to each foot, to enable the\r\nfly to rest on the surface of the water; _a_ is one of the external\r\nhairs, No. 135, under surface of left forefoot of _Cassida viridis_\r\n(tortoise-beetle), showing the bifurcate tenent appendages, one of\r\nwhich is given at _a_ more magnified. These, in ground beetles, are\r\nmet with only in males, and are used for sexual purposes. The delicacy\r\nof the structure of these hairs in the fly and the elastic membranous\r\nexpansion of the foot are marvellous. When the fly is climbing, a\r\nminute quantity of some glutinous fluid is exuded, so that the tubular\r\nnature of the tenent-hairs hardly admits of a doubt.\r\n\r\n“At the root of the pulvillus, or its under surface, is a process,\r\nwhich in some instances is short and thick, in others long and curved,\r\nand tapering to its extremity (Scatophaga), setose (Empis), plumose\r\n(Hippoboscidæ), or, in one remarkable example (Ephydra), closely\r\nresembling in its appearance the very rudimentary pulvillus with which\r\nit is associated. Just at the base of the fifth tarsal joint, on its\r\nunder surface, there is present, in Eristalis, a pair of short, very\r\nslightly curved hairs, which point almost directly downwards.”[82]\r\n\r\nTenent-hairs are usually present in some modification or other. It is\r\nreally difficult to name a beetle which has not some form of them;\r\nthe only one I yet know that seems to me really to possess nothing of\r\nthe kind is a species of Helops, living on sandy heaths. I suppose\r\nthe dense cushion of hairs on the tarsi to be for the protection,\r\nsimply, of the joints to which they are attached. I have detected them\r\non the tarsal joints of species of Ephydra, and on the first basal\r\ntarsal joint of the drone of the hive-bee. A very rudimentary form of\r\ntenent-hairs is present on the under surface of some of the tree-bugs\r\n(Pentatomidæ), which have in addition a large, deeply-cleft organ at\r\nthe extremity of the tarsus; this appears to be a true sucker.\r\n\r\nWhen walking on a rough surface, the foot represents that of a\r\nColeopterous insect without any tenent appendages. The ungues are\r\nalways attached to the last joint of an insect’s tarsus. They are not\r\nattached to the fifth tarsal joint of a Dipterous insect, neither are\r\nthey attached to the fifth tarsal joint of a Hymenopterous insect,\r\nbut to the terminal sucker, which again, in this great order, is a\r\nsixth tarsal joint, membranous, flexible, elastic in the highest\r\ndegree, retractile to almost its fullest extent within the fifth tarsal\r\njoint--a joint modified to an extraordinary degree for special purposes.\r\n\r\nIn plantula of Lucanus, with its pair of minute claws, the ungues are\r\nhairs modified for special purposes; and they have the structure of\r\ntrue hairs. The sustentacula of Epeira, the analogous structures on\r\nthe entire under surface of the last tarsal joints in Pholcus, the\r\ncondition of the parts in the hind limbs of Notonecta, in both its\r\nmature and earlier conditions, as well as in Sarcoptes, Psoroptes, and\r\nsome other Acari, all may be cited in proof of this fact. The various\r\norders of insects have, for the most part, each their own type of\r\nfoot. Thus there is the Coleopterous type, the Hymenopterous type, the\r\nDipterous type, the Homopterous type, &c.; each so very distinctive,\r\nthat in critical instances they will sometimes serve at once to show\r\nto which order an insect should be referred. Thus, amongst all the\r\nDiptera, I have as yet met with but one subdivision which presents\r\nan exception to the structure described. This exception is furnished\r\nby the Tipulidæ, which have the Hymenopterous foot. With hardly an\r\nexception, then, I believe the form of foot described will be found\r\nuniversal among the Diptera.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to add a few words on the best plan of conducting\r\nobservations on the feet of insects. Their action should be studied\r\nby placing the insect under the influence of chloroform. It is of\r\nadvantage to carefully preserve the parts examined, and for this\r\npurpose Deane’s medium or glycerine jelly suits very well; some of\r\nthe more delicate preparations, however, can only be kept unchanged\r\nin a solution of chloride of zinc. The plan of soaking in caustic\r\npotash, crushing, washing, putting into spirits of wine and then into\r\nturpentine, and lastly into Canada balsam, is perfectly useless,\r\nexcepting in rare instances where points connected with the structure\r\nof the integument have to be made out. Of course, the parts should be\r\nviewed from above, from below, and in profile, in order to gain exact\r\nideas of their relations. The binocular microscope diminishes the\r\ndifficulties which formerly had to be encountered, as by its aid many\r\nparts may be clearly viewed without preparation of any kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400.\r\n\r\n1.

(The small circles enclose each object\r\nsomewhat near the natural size.)]\r\n\r\nMoths and butterflies supply the microscopist with some of the most\r\nbeautiful objects for examination. What can be more wonderful in its\r\nadaptation than the antenna of the moth (represented in Fig. 400, No.\r\n1), with a thin, finger-like extremity almost supplying the insect\r\nwith a perfect and useful hand, moved throughout its extent by a\r\nmuscular apparatus of the most exquisite construction. The tongue of\r\nbutterfly (No. 2) is evidently made for the purpose of dipping into the\r\ninterior of flowers and extracting the juices; this act is assisted by\r\na series of fine muscles. An enlarged view of a portion is given at No.\r\n3; see Plate VI., Nos. 132 and 133, antennæ of Vapour Moth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 401.--Breathing aperture or spiracle of silkworm. (In the circle\r\nit is shown about the natural size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 402.--Magnified portions of the trachea of the Hydrophilus,\r\nshowing spiral tubes.]\r\n\r\nThe inconceivably delicate structure of the maxillæ or tongues (for\r\nthere are two) of the butterfly, rolled up like the trunk of an\r\nelephant, and capable, like it, of every variety of movement, has been\r\ncarefully examined and described by Mr. Newport. “Each maxilla is\r\nconvex on its outer surface, but concave on its inner; so that when the\r\ntwo are united they form a tube, _haustellium_, by their union, through\r\nwhich fluids may be drawn into the mouth. The inner or concave surface,\r\nwhich forms the tube, is lined with a very smooth membrane, and extends\r\nthroughout the whole length of the organ; while that of each maxilla is\r\nhollow in its interior, apparently forming a tube ‘in itself,’ but this\r\nis not so; the mistake has arisen from the existence of large tracheæ,\r\nor breathing tubes, in the interior of the proboscis. In some species\r\nthe extremity of the haustellium is studded externally with a number\r\nof minute papillæ, or fringes--as in _Vanessa atalanta_--in which they\r\nbecome small elongated barrel-shaped bodies, terminated by smaller\r\npapillæ at their extremities. On alighting on a flower, the insect\r\nmakes a powerful expiratory effort, by which the air is expelled from\r\nthe interior air-tubes, and from those with which they are connected\r\nin the head and body; and at the moment of applying its proboscis to\r\nthe food, it makes an inspiratory effort, by which the central canal in\r\nthe proboscis is dilated, and the food ascends it at the same instant\r\nto supply the vacuum produced; and thus it passes into the mouth and\r\nstomach, the constant ascent of the fluid being assisted by the action\r\nof the muscles of the proboscis, which continues during the whole\r\ntime that the insect is feeding. By this combined agency of the acts\r\nof respiration and the muscles of the proboscis we are also enabled\r\nto understand the manner in which the humming-bird sphynx extracts in\r\nan instant the honey from a flower while hovering over it, without\r\nalighting; and which it certainly would be unable to do were the ascent\r\nof the fluid entirely dependent upon the action of the muscles of the\r\norgan.”\r\n\r\nThe trachæal or respiratory system of insects varies, or rather is\r\nfound to exist in modified forms to suit their varied conditions of\r\nlife. While in the larval stage the breathing apertures are seen\r\nto recur at intervals on each side of the abdomen (as that of the\r\nsilkworm, Fig. 401), thus ensuring a continuous supply of air to\r\nthe circulating fluids throughout the whole body. These spiracles\r\nare usually nine or ten in number, and consist of a membranous ring\r\nof an oval form. The air-tubes are exquisitely composed of two thin\r\nmembranes, between which a delicate elastic thread or spiral fibre\r\nis interposed, forming a cylindrical opening and keeping the tube in\r\na distended condition, thus mechanically preserving the sides from\r\ncollapse or pressure in their passage through the air, which otherwise\r\nmight occasion suffocation. Fig. 402 represents the double spiral\r\narrangement of a portion of a trachea of Hydrophilus, which ensures\r\nboth elasticity and strength.\r\n\r\nThere are other points of interest confined to the water-beetle tribe,\r\namong the more striking of which is the foreleg of the _Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_. Here the first three joints of the tarsus are expanded\r\ninto a broad surface, and fringed throughout with curved hairs. From\r\nthe surface of these spring a number of short hairs, with cup-like\r\ndiscs at their extremities, one of which is seen highly magnified in\r\nPlate VI., No. 142. These are so cup-like in form that they have been\r\nhitherto described as “suckers,” but it is believed they are simply a\r\nspecial apparatus for the development of the hairs seen on the leg and\r\nfoot of the beetle. Another curious example occurs in the Gyrinus, or\r\nwhirligig-beetle. The front pair of legs are of the ordinary kind, but\r\nthe under pair are furnished with expanding paddles. The trochanter,\r\nfemur, and tibia, are flat plates of a triangular shape, pointed at\r\ntheir outer angles, from which the apex springs. But the tarsus is\r\njointed on the inner angle of the furthermost end of the tibia, and\r\neach of its four joints expands into a flat paddle blade. In the\r\naccompanying Fig. 403 one paddle is seen expanded, the other closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403.\r\n\r\n1. Leg of Gyrinus, Whirligig, paddle shown expanded. 2. Paddle closed\r\nup.]\r\n\r\nThese paddles are adapted with much precision to ensure the most\r\neffectual application of the propelling power; as the beetle strikes\r\nout in the act of swimming, the membranous expansion described enables\r\nit to move about with great rapidity; upon the legs being drawn back\r\ntowards the body, the membrane closes up, and thus offers no resistance\r\nto the water. The eyes are not the least curious part of the merry\r\nlittle beetle: the upper section is fitted for seeing in the air,\r\nand is adapted to the upper or superior part of the head; the lower\r\nportion, for seeing under the water, being placed at a lower angle, a\r\nthin division only separating the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404.--Scales from Butterflies’ and Moths’ wings,\r\nmagnified 200 diameters.\r\n\r\n1. Scale of _Morpho menelaus_; 2. Large scale of _Polyommatus\r\nargiolus_, azure blue; 3. _Hipparchia janira argiolus_; 4. _Pontia\r\nbrassica_; 5. _Podura plumbea_; 6. Small scale of azure blue.]\r\n\r\n_Wings of Insects._--These exhibit variety of form and structure,\r\nas well as of beauty of colouring. At an early period the orders of\r\ninsects were mainly founded upon these interesting appendages. The\r\nOrthoptera were the straight wings; the Neuroptera the nerved; the\r\nTrichoptera the hairy wings; the Coleoptera the cased or sheathed\r\nwings; the Diptera the two wings; the Hymenoptera the married wings;\r\nand the Lepidoptera the scaled wings. A number of wings are small\r\nand membranous, and may be mounted dry for examination under the\r\nmicroscope. Others are better seen mounted in benzol-balsam. The\r\nelytra, iridescent wing cases of the diamond, and other beetles, as\r\nwell as the wings of the more highly coloured butterflies, make pretty\r\nobjects mounted dry for opaque illumination by the Lieberkühn or\r\nreflector. The thicker horny cases of other members of the beetle tribe\r\nrequire long soaking, as described in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nThe wings of moths and butterflies are covered with scales or feathers,\r\ncarefully overlapping each other, as tiles are made to cover the tops\r\nof houses. The iridescent variety of colouring on insects’ wings arises\r\nfrom the peculiar wavy arrangement of the scales. Figs. 404 and 405\r\nare magnified representations of a few of them. No. 1, a scale of the\r\n_Morpho menelaus_, taken from the side of the wing, is of a pale-blue\r\ncolour; it measures about 1/120th of an inch in length, and exhibits\r\na series of longitudinal striæ or lines, between which are disposed\r\ncross-lines or other striæ, giving it very much an appearance of\r\nbrick-work (better seen in Fig. 405, No. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405.--Portions of Scales, magnified 500 diameters.\r\n\r\n1. Portion of scale of _Morpho menelaus;_ 2. Portion of large scale of\r\n_Podura plumbea;_ 3. Scale from the wing of Gnat, its two layers being\r\nrepresented; 4. Portion of a large scale of _Lepisma Saccharina;_ 5.\r\nBody scale of Gnat, magnified 650 diameters.]\r\n\r\n_Polyommatus argiolus_, azure-blue (Fig. 404, Nos. 2 and 6), are\r\nlarge and small scales taken from the under-side of the wing of this\r\nbeautiful blue butterfly; the small scale is covered with a series\r\nof spots, and exhibits both longitudinal and transverse striæ, these\r\nshould be clearly defined, and the spots separated by a quarter-inch\r\nobject-glass. No. 3, _Hipparchia janira_, is a scale from the\r\nmeadow-brown butterfly: on this brown spots, having an irregular shape\r\nwith longitudinal striæ, are seen. No. 4, _Pontia brassica_, cabbage\r\nbutterfly, was at one time taken to be an excellent criterion of the\r\npenetration and definition of an object glass. It is seen to have a\r\nfree extremity or brush-like appendage. With a fairly good power,\r\nthe longitudinal markings appear like rows of small beads. Chevalier\r\nselected for his test object the scale of the _Pontia brassica_. Mohl\r\nand Schacht extolled _Hipparchia janira_ as a good test of penetration\r\nin an objective of moderate angular aperture. Amici’s test object is\r\n_Navicula rhomboides_, the display of the lines forming the test.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406.--_Podura villosa_, male and female, highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe _Tinea vestianella_, clothes-moth, is furnished with unique scales.\r\nSmall and destructive as this moth is, it suffers much from a parasitic\r\nmite, and from which it is unable to free itself.\r\n\r\nThe Podura scale (Fig. 405), with its delicate transparent membrane\r\nand curiously inserted “notes of admiration,” as they were called,\r\nwas long believed to be an excellent test object for the highest\r\npowers of the microscope, but I believe it is no longer regarded in\r\nthat light: indeed, most insect scales have declined in the value\r\nand estimation of the skilled microscopist. This is in part due to\r\nthe improvements made in the objective. The high-angled glasses have\r\ncleared up obscure points in the structural characters of the minuter\r\nforms of life, and the scales of insects are no longer found to be\r\ndifficult test objects for the modern objective of a Zeiss or a Powell\r\nto resolve. Nevertheless, the scale of the Podura belonging to the\r\norder Thysanura, a curious little insect commonly known by the name of\r\nspringtail, usually found living in most obscure places, and too small\r\nto attract attention, is not likely to be entirely thrust aside. The\r\nspringtails (Collembola) are furnished on the under-side of the first\r\nabdominal segment with a curious tube or sucker, from the orifice of\r\nwhich glandular process a secreted viscid matter is protruded; they\r\nare remarkable also from the fact that in most of them no trace of a\r\ntracheal system has yet been discovered. The eyes when present are in\r\nthe form of simple or grouped ocelli, the antennæ number six joints,\r\nand the abdomen has but six segments, often only three. The forked tail\r\nis a curious process turned forward and attached to one of the tender\r\nsegments and held in position under the body; when released it springs\r\nback and bounds up to a very considerable height. Fig. 406 represents\r\n_Podura villosa_. There are several species, one of which (_P.\r\naquatica_) is found floating in patches on pools of water on bright\r\nsummer days.\r\n\r\n_Lepisma saccharina_ belongs to the same genus as Podura. This minute\r\nspringtail derives its name from having been discovered in old\r\nsugar-casks. It has a spindle-shaped body covered with silvery scales,\r\nlong used as test objects. The sides of the abdomen are furnished with\r\na series of appendages with long bristle-like setæ, or hairs, at their\r\nextremities. The head is concealed under a prothorax, the antennæ are\r\nlong, and the maxillary palpi are either five or seven-jointed, and\r\nvery conspicuous, to enable them to cut the dry wood on which they\r\nprincipally feed. The scales must be mounted under thin cover-glasses;\r\noblique illumination shows up some portions to advantage, while central\r\nlight from an achromatic condenser and a wide-angled objective renders\r\ntheir markings more distinct. Portion of a scale more highly magnified\r\nis shown in Fig. 405.\r\n\r\n_Eggs of Insects_ (Plate VI., Nos. 124-139).--In form, colour, and\r\nvariety of design, the eggs of insects are more surprisingly varied\r\nthan those of the feathered tribes; but as from extreme smallness\r\nthey escape observation, an acquaintance with their structure is\r\nnot so familiar as it might be. Although the eggs of the bird tribe\r\ndiffer much in their external characteristics, they closely resemble\r\neach other while yet a part of the ovarian ova, and prior to their\r\ndetachment from the ovary. At one period of their formation all\r\neggs consist of three similar parts:--1st. The internal nucleated\r\ncell, or germinal vesicle, with its macula; 2nd. The vitellus, or\r\nyolk-substance; and 3rd. The vesicular envelope, or vitelline membrane.\r\nThe germinal vesicle is the first produced, then the yolk substance,\r\nwhich gradually envelops it, and the vitelline membrane, the latest\r\nformed, incloses the whole. The chemical constituents of the egg are\r\nthe same in all cases, albumen, fatty matters, and a proportion of a\r\nsubstance precipitable by water. The production of the chorion, or\r\nshell membrane, does not take place till the ovum has attained nearly\r\nits full size, and it then appears to proceed, in part at least, from\r\nthe consolidation over the whole surface of one or more layers of an\r\nalbuminous fluid secreted from the wall of the oviduct.\r\n\r\nThe embryo cell is so directly connected with the germinal vesicle\r\nthat at a certain period it disappears altogether, and is absorbed\r\ninto the germinal yolk, or rather becomes the nucleus of the embryo,\r\nwhen a greater degree of compactness is observed in the yolk, and all\r\nthat remains of the germinal vesicle is one or more highly refracting\r\nfat globules and albuminoid bodies. Towards the end of the period of\r\nincubation, the head of the young caterpillar is said to lie towards\r\nthe dot or opening in the lid, termed the micropyle,[83] from its\r\nresemblance to a small gate, or opening through which the larva emerges\r\nforth as a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe germinal vesicle is comparatively large and well-marked while the\r\negg is yet in the ova-sac. By preparing sections after Dr. Halifax’s\r\nmethod,[84] we find that the germinal vesicle in the bee’s egg is not\r\nsituated immediately near or even below the so-called micropyle, but\r\nrather more to the side of the egg; just in the position which the head\r\nof the embryo is subsequently found to occupy at maturity.\r\n\r\nThe egg membrane, or envelope, of all the Lepidoptera is composed\r\nof three separate and distinct layers: an external slightly raised\r\ncoat, tough and hard in its character, a middle one of united cells,\r\nand a fine transparent vitelline lining membrane, perfectly smooth\r\nand homogeneous in structure, imparting solidity, and giving a\r\nfine iridescent hue to the surface. The germinal vesicle is of a\r\nproportionately large size for the egg, and its macula is at first\r\nsingle, then multiple. In the egg of the silkworm the outer membrane is\r\ncomprised of an inner reticulated membrane of non-nucleated cells, in\r\nthe outer layer the cells are arranged in an irregular circular form,\r\nalso non-nucleated, with minute interstitial setæ or hairs projecting\r\noutward.\r\n\r\nThe outer surface of the egg-shell of _Coccus Persicæ_ is covered by\r\nminute rings, of which the ends somewhat overlap. These rings are\r\nthought to be identical in their character with the whitish substance\r\nwhich exudes through pores on the under-side of the body; it is more\r\nthan probable that a succession of layers of rings fully accounts for\r\nthe beautiful prismatic hues they present viewed as opaque objects\r\nunder the microscope, and illuminated by Lieberkühn or side-condenser.\r\nThis white substance, it should be observed, forms a part of the\r\nintimate structure of the egg-shell, and is in nowise affected by\r\nmethylated spirit or dilute acids. Sir John Lubbock[85] states that in\r\nthe greenish eggs of Phryganea, “the colour is due to the yolk-globules\r\nthemselves. In Coccus, however, this is not so; the yolk-globules are\r\nslightly yellow, and the green hue of the egg is owing to the green\r\ngranules, which are minute oil globules. When, however, the egg arrives\r\nat maturity, and the upper chamber has been removed by absorption,\r\nthese green granules will be found to be replaced by dark-green\r\nglobules, regular in size, and about 1/8000th of an inch in diameter,\r\nand which appear to be in no way the same in the yolk of Phryganea\r\neggs.” Another curious fact has been noticed, which partially bears on\r\nthe question of colour: the production of parasite bodies within the\r\neggs of some insects. In the Coccus, for instance, parasitic cells of a\r\ngreen colour occur, “shaped like a string of sausages, in length about\r\nthe 1/2000th of an inch by about the 1/7000th in breadth.”\r\n\r\nThe eggs of moths and butterflies present many varying tints of colour;\r\nin speaking of this quality I do not restrict the term solely to those\r\nprismatic changes to which allusion has been made, and which are liable\r\nto constant mutations according to the accident of the rays of light\r\nthrown upon them; but I more particularly refer to the several natural\r\ntransitions of colour, the prevailing tints of which are yellow,\r\nwhite, grey, and a light-brown. In some eggs the yellow, white,\r\nand grey are delicately blended, and, when viewed with a magnifying\r\npower of about fifty diameters, and by the aid of the side-reflector\r\n(parabolic-reflector), exhibit many beautiful combinations. The more\r\ndelicate opalescent, or rather iridescent, tints appear on the eggs of\r\ninsects, while those of the feathered tribes furnish no like example.\r\nThe egg of the mottled umber moth, _Erannis defoliaria_ (Plate VI.,\r\nNo. 137), is in every way very beautiful. It is in shape ovoid, with\r\nregular hexagonal reticulations, each corner being studded with a knob\r\nor button; the space within the hexagon is finely punctated, and the\r\nplay of colours is exquisitely delicate. In this egg no micropyle can\r\nbe seen. The egg of the thorn moth, _Ennomos erosaria_ (Plate VI.,\r\nNo. 138), is of an elongated brick-looking form, one end of which is\r\nslightly tapered off, while the other, in which the lid is placed,\r\nis flattened and surrounded by a beautifully white-beaded border,\r\nhaving for its centre a slightly raised reticulated micropyle. The\r\nempty egg-shell gives a fine opalescent play of colours, while that\r\ncontaining the young worm is of a brownish-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe egg of the straw-belle moth, _Aspillates gilvaria_ (Plate VI.,\r\nNo. 139), is delicately tinted, somewhat long and narrow, with sides\r\nslightly flattened or rounded off, and irregularly serrated. The top is\r\nconvex, and the base a little indented, in which are seen the lid and\r\nmicropyle. The young worm, however, usually makes its way through the\r\nupper convex side: the indentation represented in the drawing shows the\r\nplace of exit.\r\n\r\nAn example of those eggs possessing a good deal of natural colour is\r\npresented in that of the common puss-moth, _Cerura vinula_, a large\r\nspheroidal-shaped egg, having, under the microscope, the appearance of\r\na fine ripe orange; the micropyle exactly corresponds to the depression\r\nleft in this fruit on the removal of the stalk. The surface is finely\r\nreticulated, and the natural colour a deep orange.\r\n\r\nThe egg of the mottled rustic moth, _Caradina morpheus_ (No. 124), is\r\nsubconical, and equally divided throughout by a series of ribs, which\r\nterminate in a well-marked geometrically-formed lid. The egg of the\r\ntortoise-shell butterfly, _Vanessa urticæ_ (No. 125), is ovoid and\r\ndivided into segments, the ribs turning in towards the micropyle. The\r\ncommon footman, _Lithosia campanula_ (No. 126), produces a perfectly\r\nglobular egg covered with fine reticulations of a delicate buff\r\ncolour. The egg of the shark moth, _Cucullia umbratica_ (No. 127),\r\nis subconical in form, with ribs and cross-bars passing up from a\r\nflattened base to the summit, and turning over to form the lid. No.\r\n136 is the egg of blue argus butterfly, _Polyommatus argus_. That\r\nof the small emerald moth, _Jodis Vernaria_ (No. 134), is an egg of\r\nsingular form and beauty--an oval, flattened on both sides, of silvery\r\niridescence, and covered throughout with minute reticulations and\r\ndots. It is particularly translucent, so much so that the yellow-brown\r\nworm is readily seen curled up within. The lid or micropyle is not\r\ndetected until the larva eats its way out of the shell. It should be\r\nnoted that the series of eggs in Plate VII. are somewhat over-coloured,\r\nand consequently lose much of their natural transparency. The eggs of\r\nflies and parasites also present much variety in form, colour, and\r\nconstruction. Many of their eggs are provided with a veritable lid,\r\nwhich opens up with a hinge-like articulation. This lid is seen in\r\nthe egg of bot-fly, Plate VI., No. 144, from which the larva is just\r\nescaping; No. 146, egg of Scatophaga; No. 147, egg of parasite of\r\nmagpie.[86] Still more remarkable in the delicate and beautiful forms\r\nare some of the parasities which infest birds in particular: Plate VI.,\r\nNo. 145, the egg of parasite of pheasant; No. 147, that of the magpie,\r\nwhile that of the peacock is curiously interesting. In Fig. 407 the\r\nlarvæ of the horn-bill are seen just about to emerge from their eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407.--Larvæ of the Hornbill emerging from eggs.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of most Hymenoptera are footless grubs, furnished with a soft\r\nhead, and exhibiting but little, if any, advance upon those of Diptera\r\n(Plate VI., No. 141). In the saw-fly, however, the larva, instead of\r\nbeing as above described, a mere footless maggot, presents the closest\r\nresemblance to the caterpillar of the Lepidoptera; it is provided with\r\na distinct head, with six thoracic legs, and in most cases from twelve\r\nto sixteen pro-legs are appended to the abdominal segments.\r\n\r\nOne other conspicuous object represented in Plate VI., No. 128, is the\r\nmaple Aphis, also known as the leaf-insect, averaging in size about the\r\none-fiftieth of an inch in length. Although recognised and described\r\nunder the name of the leaf-insect, nothing was known of its origin and\r\nhistory, with the exception of what the Rev. J. Thornton published in\r\n1852, and to whom we owe its re-discovery on the leaves of the maple.\r\nSubsequently it attracted the attention of the Dutch naturalist, Van\r\nder Hoeven, who regarded it as the larval form of a species of Aphis,\r\nand named it Periphyllus. It has more recently engaged the attention\r\nof Dr. Balbiani and M. Siguoret, whose united investigations will be\r\nfound in “Comptes Rendus,” 1867. These observers assigned it definitely\r\nto Aphis. A brown species is also met with during a great part of the\r\nyear feeding upon the young shoots of the maple. The female produces\r\ntwo kinds of young, as do all the genus Aphis, one normal the other\r\nabnormal; the first are alone capable of reproducing their species,\r\nwhile the latter retain their original form, which is not changed\r\nthroughout their existence. They increase so slowly in size that it\r\nmay appear doubtful whether they eat, the mouth being rudimentary;\r\nthey undergo no change; do not acquire wings, and their antennæ\r\nalways retain the five joints peculiar to all young Aphides before\r\nthe first moult. Neither are they all of the same colour, some being\r\nof a bright green, as represented in Plate VI., while others are of\r\na darker, or brownish-green colour. The brown-green embryos differ\r\nfrom the adult female only in those characters analogous to all other\r\nspecies, and this chiefly with regard to the minute hairs, which are\r\nlong and simple. In the green embryos, in the place of setæ, the body\r\nis surrounded by transparent lamellæ, oblong in shape. These scales\r\nnot only cover the body, but also the anterior portion of the head,\r\nthe first joint of the antennæ, and the outer edge of the tibiæ of the\r\nfirst pair of legs. The dorsal surface in these insects is covered\r\nwith a mosaic of hexagonal plates, very closely resembling the plates\r\nof the carapace of the tortoise. In this particular my artist has\r\nfallen into a slight error. Another peculiarity is that the body is\r\nmuch flattened out, and looks so much like a scale on the surface of\r\nthe leaf that it requires considerable practice, as well as quickness\r\nof sight, to detect the young maple Aphis. One of the lamellæ is\r\nseen highly magnified at _c_, and a tenent-hair at _b_. The antennæ,\r\ntapering off towards the apex, are serrate on both edges, and terminate\r\nin a fine lancet (shown at _a_), with which it penetrates the leaf of\r\nthe plant. Beneath the insertions of the antennæ is a complex form\r\nof sucking mouth, and on either side of the head are two brilliant\r\nscarlet-coloured eyes.\r\n\r\n_Aphides_, as is well known, live upon the juices of plants, which they\r\nsuck, and when they occur in great numbers cause considerable damage\r\nto the gardener and farmer. Many plants are liable to be attacked by\r\nswarms of these insects, when their leaves curl up, they grow sickly,\r\nand their produce is either greatly reduced or utterly ruined. One\r\nstriking instance is presented in the devastation caused by the hop-fly\r\n(_Aphis humuli_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.--_Aphrophora spumaria_, Cuckoo-spit.\r\n\r\n_a._ The frothy substance; _b._ The pupa.]\r\n\r\nThe _Aphrophora bifasciata_, common frog-hopper, is a well-known garden\r\npest. The antennæ of this insect are placed between the eyes, and the\r\nscutellum is not covered; the eyes, never more than two in number, are\r\noccasionally wanting. These pests are furnished with long hind legs,\r\nthat enable them to perform most extraordinary leaping feats. The\r\nbest-known British species is the cuckoo-spit, froth-fly (Fig. 408).\r\nThe names cuckoo-spit and froth-fly both allude to the peculiar habit\r\nof the insect, while in the larva state, of enveloping itself in a kind\r\nof frothy secretion, somewhat resembling saliva.\r\n\r\n_Arachnidæ._--In this class of insects, spiders, scorpions, and mites\r\nare included, all of which belong to a sub-class of Arthropoda, and\r\nare appropriately placed between the Crustacea on the one hand and\r\nthe Insecta on the other. The highest Crustaceans have ten feet, the\r\nArachnidæ eight, and insects six. The Arachnidæ are wingless, have no\r\nantennæ, and breathe by means of tracheal tubes, or pulmonary sacs,\r\nthese performing the function of lungs. As a rule they have several\r\nsimple eyes, have no proper metamorphosis, and they are essentially\r\npredaceous, the females being larger than the males. Most of the\r\nArachnidæ live on insects, and may therefore be regarded in the light\r\nof a friend to the florist and gardener.\r\n\r\nThe _Epeira diadema_ is the best known member of the species; in summer\r\nspiders abound on every shrub, and spin out their wonderful webs from\r\nbranch to branch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409.--A lengthways section through the body of\r\nfemale _Epeira diadema_.\r\n\r\nExplanation of reference.--_ey._ Eyes; _p.g._ Poison gland; _ht._\r\nHeart; _in._ Intestine, alimentary canal; _l._ Liver; _r._ Rectum or\r\ncloaca; _dt._ and _sp._ Discharge tubes of spinnerets; _o._ Slit, or\r\nair opening; _ov._ Ovipositor; _ph._ Pharynx; _br._ Brain; _thr._\r\nThroat, or gullet, filled with eggs; _un. l._ Under lip; _m._ Mouth;\r\n_f._ Fang, or claw; _j._ Jaw. The gills, or breathing apparatus are\r\nsituated at the air opening, _o_; and the silk glands are above this.\r\n(Magnified 20 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nThe body, seen in my illustration, Fig. 409, in section, consists of\r\ntwo parts; the foremost is the cephalothorax, or head, upon which is\r\nmounted four pairs of eyes (two of which are seen in section), while to\r\nthe thorax is attached eight jointed well-developed legs terminating in\r\nfeet, with claws adapted for climbing and holding on. The other half\r\nconsists, of the abdomen, together with spinnerets and glands, which\r\nsecrete the fluid out of which the web is spun, and this, although\r\nit hardens to some extent on exposure to the air, retains its viscid\r\nnature for the purpose of entangling its prey. The spinnerets are the\r\nmost interesting feature in the anatomy of the Epeira (Figs. 410 and\r\n411).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410.\r\n\r\n1. Spinnerets of Spider; 2. Extreme end of one of the upper pair of\r\nspinnerets; 3. End of under pair of spinnerets; 4. Foot of Spider; 5.\r\nSide view of eye; 6. The arrangement of the four pairs of eyes.]\r\n\r\nFive kinds of spinning glands are found in spiders. The glandulæ\r\naciniformes are those which consist of a proper tunica and an\r\nepithelium; these exhibit in all parts the same reaction to staining\r\nagents. The glandulæ pyriformes consist of a tunica proper and an\r\nepithelium, which in their lower parts (or those near the efferent\r\nducts) stain more deeply than the upper. The glandulæ ampullaceæ and\r\nglandulæ tubuliformes have similar coverings, the latter terminating in\r\na large spool. The glandulæ aggregatæ have a wide and branched lumen,\r\nthe efferent duct of which is provided with cells and an accessory\r\npiece, which draws out to a tip. All the glands have secreting\r\nportions, which serve as collecting cavities for the spinning material.\r\nThe spools are two-jointed basal and one-jointed accessory pieces.\r\nIn addition to the five glands enumerated, there are also lobate and\r\ncribelleum glands; these are variously distributed, and exercise\r\ndifferent functions, one set preparing the so-called moist filaments\r\nfrom the moist droplets, another spins the egg-cocoon, as nearly all\r\nspiders envelop their eggs in a covering of silken threads and store\r\nthem up in some sheltered place awaiting the warm weather of spring to\r\nhatch them out. The bag that holds the eggs is not one of the least\r\ncurious efforts of skill and care. The mother uses her body as a gauge\r\nto measure her work, precisely as a bird uses her body to gauge the\r\nsize and form of its nest. The spider first spreads a thin coating of\r\nsilk as a foundation, taking care to have this circular by turning its\r\nbody round during the process. In the same manner it spins a raised\r\nborder round this till it takes the form of a cup; it is at this stage\r\nof the work the female begins to lay her eggs in the cup, and not\r\ncontent to fill it up to the brim, she also piles up a heap as high\r\nas the cup is deep. Here, then, is a cup full of eggs, the under half\r\ncovered and protected by the silken sides of the cup, but the upper\r\nstill exposed to the air and the cold. She now sets to work to cover\r\nthis; the process is similar to the preceding--that is, she weaves a\r\nthick web of silk all round the top, and instead of a cup-shaped nest,\r\nlike those of the bird tribe, the whole partakes of the form of a ball\r\nmuch larger than the body of the spider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411.--Spinnerets of Spider greatly enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe eight legs and feet of the spider (one only is represented Fig.\r\n410, No. 4) are curiously constructed. Each foot, when magnified, is\r\nseen to be armed with strong horny claws, with serrations on their\r\nunder-surface. By this arrangement the spider is enabled to regulate\r\nthe issue of its web from the spinnerets. In addition, a remarkable\r\ncomb-like claw is provided for the purpose of separating certain\r\nthreads which enter into the composition of the delicate web, so that\r\neverything is arranged and planned in the most geometrical order, while\r\nthe mouth or jaws with their two movable poison-fangs convert the\r\nArachnidæ into formidable and dangerous foes. The maternal industry\r\nand instincts of spiders, the ballooning habits of others, the cave\r\ndwellers, with their limited vision, combined with an increased\r\ndelicacy of touch and hearing, their disguise of feigned death when a\r\nstrong enemy approaches, are all of the most interesting character.\r\n\r\nOne of the more remarkable, the _Argyroneta aquatica_ (diving spider),\r\nweaves itself a curious little bell-shaped globule, which it takes with\r\nit to the bottom of the water, whither it retires to devour its prey.\r\nNotwithstanding its aquatic habits, this, like the rest of its species,\r\nis fitted only for aerial respiration; it therefore carries down,\r\nentangled amongst the hairs of its body, a small bubble of air. This\r\ncontrivance presents us with the earliest form of diving-bell.\r\n\r\n_Mites and Ticks_ constitute a group which for diversity of structure,\r\nnumber of species and individuals, and minuteness of size, has no\r\nequal. The typical genus of the family--Ixodidæ--being wholly parasitic\r\nin their habits, are so modified in organisation, so marked by\r\ndegeneration, that some authors have proposed to remove them into a\r\nclass by themselves. One leading character distinguishes the whole: the\r\nabdomen rarely presents a trace of segmentation, but is confluent with\r\nthe cephalothorax, the fusion between the two being so complete that,\r\nas in the harvest spiders belonging to Palpatores, the anterior sternal\r\nplates of the abdomen are thrust far forward between the coxæ of the\r\ncephalothoracic limbs. As in Arachnidæ, however, the mouth is adapted\r\nfor sucking, but the jaws are often partially united, and form, with\r\na plate termed the _epistome_ and the labium, a beak. The mandibles\r\nare either pincer-like, or simply pointed at the tip, forming piercing\r\norgans; the palpi have their basal segments, or maxillæ, united, which\r\nform a conspicuous plate, or _hypostomes_, constituting the floor of\r\nthe mouth. These organs are often seen to be separated from the rest of\r\nthe cephalothorax by a membranous joint, and constitute a kind of head,\r\nthe _capitulum_. In most cases no trace of special respiratory organs\r\ncan be found. Another characteristic of value in separating ticks from\r\nharvest-spiders is that in the former the young undergo a metamorphosis\r\nin the course of growth, being hatched as six-footed larvæ, and\r\nacquiring later in life a fourth pair of legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412.\r\n\r\nA. _Atax spinipes_, water mite seen from below; B. Water Scorpion\r\ninfested by Atax.]\r\n\r\nThe Acariæ include a number of families, all distinguished by the\r\nposition of the respiratory stigmata and the form of the mandibles and\r\npalpi. In the velvety mites (Trombidiidæ), the integument is soft and\r\ncovered with variously-coloured fine hairs, and the legs are adapted\r\nfor walking, running or swimming. The latter live in fresh-water ponds,\r\ncreeping over the leaves of aquatic plants. The fresh-water mites\r\n(_Atax spinipes_, Fig. 412) swim about freely by means of vigorous\r\nstrokes of their legs, which act as oars. In the adult the body is more\r\nor less spherical, and usually of a bright red or greenish colour. The\r\nmales of one species have a curious blunt tail-like prolongation from\r\nthe hinder end of the abdomen. The eggs are laid in the spring on the\r\nstems of water plants, and the six-footed larvæ when hatched attach\r\nthemselves to water-bugs (Nepa) or water-beetles (Dytiscus) by means of\r\na large sucker developed on the front of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413.--_Ixodes ricinus_ or Sheep-tick (under\r\nsurface). The small circle encloses one life-size.]\r\n\r\nOf all the Acari, the best known and most troublesome are those\r\nbelonging to the family Ixodidæ; these infest the whole animal\r\ncreation. They are furnished with a long cylindrical beak, armed with\r\nrecurved hooks, formed of the two mandibles above and the long slender\r\nlabium below. They have no eyes, nor apparently any dermaploptic\r\nsense, but there are various seemingly sensitive setæ distributed\r\nover the body and on the appendages. The whole of the mites will be\r\nfound suitable objects for the study of development, as the process\r\nis slow and their eggs do not require much care. The segmentation of\r\nthe eggs differs; some of the cells are distinguished by their large\r\nnuclei, which stain feebly by carmine. During the cleavage of the egg\r\nno division of the so-called yolk has been observed, but later on this\r\nbreaks up into several minute pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 414.--Mouth organs of Sheep-tick.\r\n\r\n_c._ Capitulum; _d, e, f, g._ Segments of palpi; _h._ Labial process;\r\n_i._ Spiny beak formed of fused mandibles.--(Warne.)]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying Fig. 413 shows the under surface of the body and the\r\nmouth parts of the common English dog and sheep tick, _Ixodes ricinus_,\r\nwith its six formidable legs. The upper surface is shown in Fig. 415;\r\nthe head (_capitulum_) and mouth organs in Fig. 414, _c_, _d_, _e_,\r\n_f_, _g_, together with the four segments of the palpi; _h_ the labial\r\nprocess armed with hooks forming the lower side of the beak, and _i_\r\nindicating the tips of the two mandibles forming the upper side, and\r\nprojecting beyond the apex of the labium. By means of this beak, which\r\nis thrust to its base into the integument, the tick adheres firmly to\r\nits host, and in detaching them care must be taken that the head is\r\nnot left behind buried in the skin. This tick is found in all stages\r\nof growth; the females, gorging themselves with blood, swell up to the\r\nsize of a pea, as seen in Fig. 413, but the male, formerly regarded as\r\na distinct species, is of a much smaller size. In distribution these\r\npests are almost cosmopolitan, and in tropical countries they grow to\r\nmuch greater dimensions, the females sometimes attaining the size of a\r\nlarge gooseberry.\r\n\r\nThe family of true mites is that of the Sarcoptidæ; these are either\r\nfree or parasitic. They have no breathing organs; the palpi are\r\nbasally fused to the rostrum, the mandibles are pincer-like, and\r\nthe tarsi are often furnished at their tips with a sucker. The most\r\nfamiliar is the cheese mite, Tyroglyphus, which feeds upon decaying\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415.\r\n\r\n1. Female Sheep-tick; 2. Rat-tick; 3. Head of Cat-flea; 4. Larva of\r\nFlea. (The life size is given in circles.)]\r\n\r\nThe well-known cheese mite attains to a size plainly visible to the\r\nnaked eye, but when first hatched out from the egg (shown in its\r\nseveral stages of development in Fig. 417), requires a moderate amount\r\nof magnification. Its growth, however, is rapid and the young begin\r\nto feed as soon as they leave the egg. The body is partially covered\r\nover by setæ, or hairs, and the feet terminate in hooklets, as seen\r\nin the full-grown acarus. The mandibles are cutting, but as a rule\r\nthey prefer soft and partially-decayed kinds of food. It also feeds\r\nupon damaged flour, sugar, and other domestic articles. The _Dermestes\r\nlardarius_, one of the minute beetle tribe (Fig. 418), commits even\r\ngreater depredations among insect and other collections during the\r\nlarval stage of its existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416.\r\n\r\nTyroglyphus. 1. _Pediculus vulgaris_ × 50 diameters; 2. _Acarus\r\ndestructor_ under surface; 3. _Sarcoptes scabici_, Itch-insect,\r\nmagnified 350 diameters; 4. _Demodex folliculorum_ from the human\r\nskin in various stages of growth, from the egg upwards, magnified 400\r\ndiameters. (The small circles enclose the objects of the natural size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417.--The Cheese Mite, _Acarus domesticus_, seen in\r\nits several stages of development.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 418.--_Dermestes lardarius_: larva, pupa, and imago. (Natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nBirds suffer much from mites living parasitically upon them belonging\r\nto Sarcoptidæ; these likewise infest mankind, and give rise to a\r\ndisease known as the itch (Fig. 416, No. 3). This malady and the\r\nirritation accompanying it are caused by the mite excavating tunnels\r\nunder the skin. In these the eggs are laid and hatched, and the young\r\nthen start burrowing on their own account; their burrows are traced as\r\nwhitish lines on the surface of the skin.\r\n\r\nFig. 416, No. 4, _Demodex folliculorum_, is another remarkable parasite\r\nfound beneath the skin; this is usually obtained from a spot where the\r\nsebaceous follicles or fat glands are abundant, such as the forehead,\r\nthe side of the nose, and the angles between the nose and lip. If\r\nthe part where a little black spot or a pustule is seen be squeezed\r\nrather hard, the oily matter there accumulated will be forced out in\r\na globular form. This minute mite is less than one-fiftieth of an\r\ninch in length; if it be laid on a glass slide, and a small quantity\r\nof glycerine added to cause the separation of the harder portions,\r\nthe parasite in all probability will float out, and, by means of a\r\nfine-pointed pencil or brush, can be transferred to a clean slide and\r\nmounted in Canada balsam. An allied species is found in the skin of\r\ndogs suffering from mange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419.\r\n\r\n1. Parasite of Turkey; 2. Acarus of common Fowl, under surface; 3.\r\nParasite of Pheasant. (The small circles enclose each about life size.)]\r\n\r\nThe Stylopidæ are remarkable parasites, living upon the bodies of\r\nwasps, bees, and bugs, and present a type of structure quite distinct\r\nfrom beetles or the ticks described. The male (_Xenos peckii_, Fig.\r\n420) is a winged insect with coarsely faceted eyes, large fan-shaped\r\nwings, extremely small inconspicuous elytra, the two first thoracic\r\nrings short, while the metathorax is elongated and covers the base of\r\nthe abdomen, and the hind legs are placed a long way behind the middle\r\npair. The female, on the other hand, is a grub-like creature, without\r\nlegs, wings, or eyes; she never leaves the body of her host, and from\r\nher eggs active little larvæ develop and get carried into the nests of\r\nbees and wasps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420.--_Xenos peckii._ 1. Male; 2. Female.]\r\n\r\nMites are very numerous, differ in form, and are interesting objects\r\nunder the microscope. The body of the common flea (Fig. 421) is divided\r\ninto distinct segments, those about the thorax being separated.\r\nAlthough apterous, the flea has the rudiments of four wings in the\r\nform of horny plates on both sides of the thoracic segments. Its mouth\r\nconsists of a pair of sword-shaped mandibles, finely serrated; these,\r\nwith a sharp, penetrating, needle-like organ, constitute the formidable\r\nweapons with which it pierces through the skin.\r\n\r\nThe neck is distinctly separated, and the body covered with scales, the\r\nedges of which are beset with short setæ; from the head project a short\r\npair of antennæ, below which are a proboscis and a lance-shaped cutting\r\napparatus. On each side of the head a large compound eye is placed; it\r\nhas six many-jointed powerful legs, terminating in two-hooked claws; a\r\npair of long hind legs are kept folded up when the insect is at rest,\r\nwhich, in the act of jumping, it suddenly straightens out with great\r\nmuscular force. The female flea (Fig. 421) lays a great number of eggs,\r\nsticking them together with a glutinous secretion; the flea infesting\r\nthe dog or cat glues its eggs to the roots of the hairs. In about four\r\ndays the eggs are hatched out, and a small white larva or grub is seen\r\ncrawling about, and feeding most actively. Plate VI., No. 141, is a\r\nmagnified view of one covered with short hairs. After nine or ten days\r\nthe larva assumes the pupa form; this it retains four days, and in\r\nnine days more it becomes a perfect flea. The head of the flea found\r\nin the cat (Fig. 415, No. 3) somewhat differs in form from that of the\r\nspecies infesting the human being; its jaws are furnished with more\r\nformidable-looking mandibles, and from between the first and second\r\njoints behind the head short strong spines project.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421.\r\n\r\n1. Female Flea; 2. Male Flea. (The small circles enclose fleas of about\r\nlife size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422.\r\n\r\n1. Parasite of Eagle; 2. Parasite of Vulture; 3. Parasite of Pigeon,\r\n_Sarcoptes palumbinus._ (The circles enclose each about life size.)]\r\n\r\nTwo small and obscure groups of the mites and ticks have been\r\nassociated with the latter, but for no better reason than that their\r\naffinities are unknown. The first of these are the Tardigrada, or bear\r\nanimalcules, which comprise microscopical animals living in damp,\r\nsandy, and mossy places; the body is long and oval in shape, and\r\npossesses four pairs of bud-like unjointed appendages, each tipped with\r\nclaws: the last pair of legs project from the hinder part of the body.\r\nThe mouth is much subdued, and only a trace of jaws is found as a pair\r\nof stylets; there appear to be no organs of respiration or circulation,\r\nand, unlike what obtains in all true Arachnida, the sexes are united in\r\neach individual. These curious infusorial creatures have been found by\r\nmyself in an infusion of cow manure.\r\n\r\n_Injurious Insects._--In describing some of the more interesting points\r\nin connection with insect life, I have only quite incidentally referred\r\nto the destructive habits of the larger number of insects and the\r\nravages annually inflicted, chiefly by the smaller parasitical tribes,\r\nupon our cultivated crops of all kinds.\r\n\r\nHere we have a wide field of research open to the microscopist, whose\r\ninvestigations must be carried out systematically, day by day, and for\r\nwhich a moderate power will effectually serve his purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are some ten or twelve species of injurious insects that attack\r\nthe hop plant. By way of example, I will select one of the least known\r\namong them, the hop-flea, or beetle (_Haltica concinna_). This is\r\nsufficiently minute to require the aid of the microscope, and very\r\nclosely resembles the turnip-flea proper, _H. nemorum_. Under the\r\nmicroscope the former will be seen to differ considerably. Its colour\r\nis brassy, whereas the colour of its congener is dusky or black, and\r\nits wing-cases are striped. They both have wonderful powers of jumping.\r\n_H. concinna_ has a curious toothed formation of the tibia, with a set\r\nof spines, while the tibia of the turnip-flea is without any curve.\r\nIt presents other points of difference. The hop-flea is, in fact, a\r\nwinged beetle, and passes the winter in the perfect state under clods,\r\ntufts of grass, or weeds outside the hop-plantation, and here it lays\r\nits eggs. In the early spring the larvæ are hatched out as a little\r\nwhite maggot, which immediately makes its way to the hop-plant and\r\nburrows into the young leaves and feeds upon its tissues. Here we have\r\nan insect taken at random from among thousands of others of the most\r\ndestructive kinds which annually destroy crops of enormous value to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tuffen West, del.      Edmund Evans.\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVertebrata.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most complicated condition in which matter exists is where, under\r\nthe influence of life, it forms bodies with a structure of tubes and\r\ncavities in which fluids are incessantly in motion, and producing\r\ncontinuous changes. These have been rightly designated “organised\r\nbodies,” because of the various organs they contain. The two principal\r\nclasses into which organised bodies have been divided are recognised as\r\nvegetable and animal. It was Bichat who taught that our animal life is\r\ndouble, while our organic life is single. In organic life, to stop is\r\nto die; and the life we have in common with vegetables never sleeps,\r\nand if the circulation of the fluids within the animal body ceases for\r\na few seconds, it ceases for ever. In the vertebrate body, however, the\r\ncombination of organs attains to the highest development, in striking\r\ncontrast with that of the class we have previously considered, the\r\nInvertebrata, the animal kingdom being divided into Vertebrates and\r\nInvertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe Vertebrata are distinguished from all other animals by the\r\ncircumstance that a transverse and a vertical section of the body\r\nexhibits two cavities completely separated from one another by a\r\npartition. A still more characteristic feature separates the one from\r\nthe other; it is the specialisation of the chief nervous centres, and\r\ntheir peculiar relation to the other systems of the body.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal cavity of the body contains the cerebro-spinal nervous\r\nsystem, the ventral, the alimentary canal, the heart, and usually a\r\ndouble chain of ganglia; these pass under the name of the sympathetic\r\nsystem. It is very probable that this sympathetic nervous system\r\nrepresents, wholly or partially, the principal nervous system of\r\nthe Annulosa and Mollusca. In any case, the central parts of the\r\ncerebro-spinal nervous system--_i.e._, the brain and the spinal\r\ncord--would appear to be unrepresented among invertebrate animals.\r\nLikewise, in the partition between the cerebro-spinal and visceral\r\ntubes, certain structures which are not represented in Invertebrates\r\nare contained. During the embryonic condition of all Vertebrates,\r\nthe centre of the partition is occupied by an elongated cellular\r\ncylindrical mass, the notochord, or chorda dorsalis. This structure\r\npersists throughout the life in some Vertebrata, but in most it\r\nis more or less completely replaced by a jointed, partly fibrous,\r\ncartilaginous, and bony vertical column. All vertebrate animals have\r\na complete vascular system. In the thorax and abdomen, in place of a\r\nsingle perivisceral cavity, in communication with the vascular system,\r\nand serving as a blood-sinus, there are one or more serous sacs. These\r\ninvest the principal viscera, and may or may not communicate with\r\nthe exterior, recalling in the latter case the atrial cavities of\r\nthe Mollusca. In all Vertebrata, except Amphioxus, there is a single\r\nvalvular heart, and all possess a hepatic portal system, the blood of\r\nthe alimentary canal never being wholly returned directly to the heart\r\nby the ordinary veins, but being more or less completely collected into\r\na trunk (the portal vein), which ramifies through and supplies the\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nWith reference to one other point of importance, the development of the\r\nova of Vertebrates, these have the same primary composition as those of\r\nother animals, consisting of a germinal vesicle containing one or more\r\ngerminal nuclei, and included within a vitellus. But as this forms a\r\npart of general anatomy, and as my object is simply the investigation\r\nof the fundamental and microscopical structure of animal organisms,\r\nI shall not further pursue the morphological part of the subject,\r\nespecially as so many excellent text-books are within reach of the\r\nstudent who desires to fully acquaint himself with precise information.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, then, the apparent diversity in the structure of\r\nthe vertebrate and the invertebrate and the various tissues of which\r\nanimals and vegetables are constituted, microscopical research has\r\nsatisfactorily demonstrated that all textures have their origin in\r\ncells; in fact, when the formative process is complete, the animal\r\ncell is seen to consist of the same parts and almost the same chemical\r\nconstituents as the typical cell of the plant--namely, a definite\r\ncell-wall enclosing cell contents, of which the nature may be diverse,\r\nbut the cell nucleus is precisely the same and is the actual seat\r\nand origin of all formative activity. The cell and nucleus grow by\r\nassimilation or intersusception, that is, by inflowing of nutrition\r\namong all parts, the new replacing the old, yet maintaining its\r\noriginal structure and composition. That which was once thought special\r\nto animals is now found to be common to both plants and animals: they\r\nare found to be alike fundamentally in internal structure, and in the\r\ndischarge of the mysterious processes of reproduction and of nutrition,\r\nalthough the latter forms a convenient line of separation. Life in\r\nplants goes on indefinitely; cuttings may be taken without injury to\r\ntheir vigour and duration of life. The same may be said of some of the\r\nlower forms of invertebrate life; for example, the hydra, the anemone,\r\nand some other well-known animals, may be cut up, divided into several\r\nparts, each one of which will form a new animal, provided a nucleus be\r\nincluded in the section. Nevertheless, the organisation of the amœba\r\nand the hydra is as complete for its purpose as that of man for his,\r\nand the evidence of continuity forbids the drawing of hard and fast\r\nlines, as was formerly done between the two kingdoms, the animal and\r\nvegetable. The amount of similarity or agreement in the organisation\r\nof animals is various. Animals indeed differ from each other in slight\r\npoints only, for the discovery of which the microscope must be brought\r\ninto requisition. Living matter in its earliest stage and simplest form\r\nappears to the naked eye as a homogeneous structure, but when placed\r\nunder the highest powers of the microscope, it is seen not to be so.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most marked feature of the age has been the increasing\r\nattention given to the study of the lower forms of life, using their\r\nsimpler structures and more diffuse phenomena to elucidate the more\r\ngeneral properties of living matter. To understand life we must\r\nunderstand protoplasm. Of this there can be no doubt, as we have seen\r\nin a previous chapter that a whole family, the Monera, consists of\r\nthis simple living, microscopic, jelly-like substance, which has not\r\neven begun to be differentiated, as in the amœba, which has as yet no\r\nspecial organs, and every speck becomes a mouth or a stomach, and which\r\ncan be turned inside out and shoot out tongues of jelly to move and\r\nfeel with. “Reproduction is the faculty most characteristic of life,\r\nand sharply distinguishes the organic from the inorganic.” It is,\r\nthen, the corpuscles of protoplasm, called cells (cellulæ), which have\r\nso much interest for the physiologist, and these, like the cytods, may\r\nform independent organisms, which are then termed unicellular. Again,\r\ncells form other cells, and a multicellular organism results, and goes\r\non increasing in geometrical progression. In the Vertebrata the cell\r\nretains its characteristic spheroidal shape, as seen in Fig. 423, and\r\nundergoes division by virtue of its living protoplasmic mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423.\r\n\r\n1. Newly formed cell structure; 2. Division of the nucleus; 3. It\r\nchanges its situation in the cell; 4. Subdivides and breaks up; 5.\r\nCell-walls increase in thickness; 6.

Become multicellular.]\r\n\r\n_Epithelial Cells._--All free surfaces of the human body, both internal\r\nand external, are to a very considerable extent covered by epithelium\r\ncells. These cells are everywhere the same, but with modifications in\r\nshape and arrangement. Epithelial cells are nucleated and always joined\r\nby their surfaces or edges, without, on the external surfaces, the\r\nintervention of connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThere are four essential varieties:--1. Tesselated; 2. Columnar; 3.\r\nSpheroidal; 4. Ciliated; in all of which the nucleus remains remarkably\r\nuniform in its characters, is either round or oval, and flattened\r\nout, measuring 1/6000th to 1/4000th of an inch in diameter. They\r\nare insoluble in acetic acid, colourless, or slightly tinted by the\r\nstructure with which they are in contact, and usually contain one or\r\nmore nucleoli with a few minute irregular granules, as represented in\r\nFig. 424.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most commonly distributed variety is the tesselated,\r\nknown also as the scaly, squamous, pavement, and flattened\r\nepithelium, always arranged in single layers, lining serous cavities,\r\nmany parts of the mucous membrane, and the interior of ducts and\r\nblood vessels. Upon the external surface of the body it occurs in\r\nsuperimposed layers, forming the “stratified epidermis.” To obtain\r\nspecimens of lamellar epithelium it is only necessary to collect a\r\nlittle saliva, or pass a glass slide over the lining membrane of the\r\ncheek, cover it with a thin cover glass, and examine it with a 1/4-inch\r\nobjective. Pavement epithelium is the elementary structure of hair,\r\nnails, and horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nANIMAL TISSUES.]\r\n\r\nColumnar epithelium exists upon the mucous membrane of the stomach, on\r\nthe villi of the intestines, and in the several canals. It occupies\r\neither a vertical or horizontal position, and may be detached in rows,\r\nas shown in Plate XIX., No. 2, a section taken from the intestine of a\r\nrabbit. This variety, when more highly magnified, as in Fig. 424, is\r\nseen to consist of club-shaped nucleated cells, the thicker end being\r\nturned towards the surface. The protoplasm of the cell is granular,\r\nand the presence of minute vacuoles and fatty globules occupy a great\r\npart of the space. The nucleus is now seen to contain a fine network.\r\nAt times the outer end of the cell is distended, as in Fig. 3. This\r\nform of columnar epithelium (known as the “goblet” cell) presents a\r\nclose and remarkable resemblance to the cilio-flagellate “collared”\r\ninfusorial monad in its extended “wine-glass” form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Pavement epithelium, taken from an internal membrane; 2.\r\nColumnar epithelium, from the intestine of a rabbit, showing central\r\nfat globules, and at str a fine ciliated border; 3. A so-called\r\n“goblet”-cell.]\r\n\r\nSpheroidal epithelium is confined to the closed cavities of the body,\r\nand in the internal structure of the ducts of secreting glands. The\r\ncells are, for the most part, circular, although some are flattened\r\nout at the sides in which they are in contact with each other (Plate\r\nXIX., No. 1_a_). Specimens of this form may be taken from the internal\r\nsurface of one of the lower animals with a scalpel. The collected\r\nmatter must be placed in a drop of distilled water and examined with a\r\nhigh power.\r\n\r\nCiliated epithelium is characterised by the presence of those fine\r\nhair-like filaments (cilia) attached to the free surface of the\r\ncell. During life, and for some time after death, the cilia are seen\r\nto retain their constant waving motion. The cilia all move in one\r\ndirection and rhythmically, thus giving rise to the appearance of a\r\nsuccession of undulations. Ciliated epithelium is found lining the\r\nmucous membrane of the air passages and nasal ducts, and wherever it\r\nis necessary to urge on a secretion by mechanical means, ciliated\r\nepithelium exists. Specimens for examination are easily obtained\r\nfrom the oyster, and with care will show the characteristic motion.\r\nA portion of a gill separated from the mollusc will live on for a\r\nconsiderable time if kept in a little of its natural secretion. The\r\nparameciæ, rotifera, and all the ciliata, are furnished with cilia\r\nas a means of locomotion and obtaining sustenance. By snipping off\r\na small piece from the gills of the mussel, always accessible to\r\nthe microscopist, and covering it over with thin glass to prevent\r\nevaporation of the animal juices, its cilia will continue to work for\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Lymph and Blood_, Fig. 425 B, _a a_.--There are other cells in the\r\nanimal body which possess a certain amount of resemblance to those\r\nconfined to the more superficial structures--_i.e._, the lymph, chyle,\r\nand blood. These fluids present in one respect a physical uniformity\r\nof composition, and a resemblance in the size of their characteristic\r\ncorpuscles. Chyle contains besides the corpuscles of lymph, a quantity\r\nof minute granules which imparts a white colour to the fluid.\r\nIntermixed are oil globules, free nuclei, and sometimes a few red blood\r\ndiscs. Chyle may be had for microscopic examination by squeezing a\r\nlittle juice from the lymphatic gland of a sheep just slaughtered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425.--Human Blood Corpuscles and Crystals.\r\n\r\nA. _a a._ Red blood corpuscles lying flat on the warm stage; _b b._\r\nin profile; _c c._ arranged in rouleaux; _d_. crenated; _e_. rendered\r\nspherical by water; I. leucocytes and white amœboid corpuscles; B.\r\nBlood discs of fowl, red and white, others seen in convexity and with a\r\nnucleus. Blood Crystals.--C. Hæmatin from human blood; D. Hæmatoidin;\r\nE. Hæmin; F. Tetrahedral; G. Pentagonal; H. Octahedral crystals from\r\nblood of mouse.]\r\n\r\n_Blood Corpuscles_ or cells vary considerably in mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, and fishes. Fig. 102 (page 143) is a microphotograph of a\r\ndrop of blood magnified 3,500 times; and Fig. 425, A, shows both red\r\nand white discs drawn to scale, magnified 1,200 diameters. The red\r\ncorpuscles of human blood are distinguished by their clearly defined\r\noutlines and dark centres. Each disc is biconcave in form, and hence\r\nthe whole surface cannot be focussed at the same time. When the\r\ncircumference is well illuminated the centre is dark, but by bringing\r\nthe objective nearer to the object, the concavity of the disc is\r\nbrought into focus. It generally happens that blood corpuscles, on\r\nbeing first drawn, run together, and present the appearance of rolls\r\nof coins; or they may be scattered about over the field. There is a\r\nconsiderable difference in the form of the discs; they are circular in\r\nall mammals, except the camel, dromedary, and llama, these being oval.\r\nIn profile blood corpuscles are biconcave, their investing membrane\r\nis homogeneous and elastic, and will readily move along the smallest\r\ncapillary vessels. There is no trace of a nucleus in the blood-discs of\r\nthe adult Mammalia, while in size they bear no proportion to the bulk\r\nof the animal in whose blood-vessels they circulate. The corpuscles\r\nof Mammalia in general are like those of man in form and size, being\r\neither a little larger or smaller. The most marked exception is\r\nthe blood of the musk-deer, in which the corpuscles are of extreme\r\nsmallness, about the 1/12000th of an inch in diameter. In the elephant\r\nthey are large, about 1/2700th of an inch in diameter. The goat, among\r\ncommon animals, has very small corpuscles, but they are, withal, twice\r\nas large as those of the musk-deer. In the _Menobranchus lateralis_\r\nthey are of a much larger size than in any animal, being the 1/350th\r\nof an inch; in the proteus, the 1/400th of an inch in the longest\r\ndiameter; in the salamander, or water-newt, 1/600th; in the frog,\r\n1/900th; lizards, 1/1400th; in birds, 1/1700th; and in man, 1/3200th\r\nof an inch. Of fishes, the cartilaginous have the largest corpuscles;\r\nin gold-fish, they are about the 1/1700th of an inch in their longest\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe large size of the blood discs in reptiles, especially in the\r\nBatrachia, has been of great service to physiologists by enabling them\r\nto ascertain many particulars regarding structure which could not have\r\nbeen otherwise determined with certainty. The value of the spectroscope\r\nin the chemical examination of the blood has been already referred to.\r\nSee page 252.\r\n\r\nWhite corpuscles or leucocytes (Fig. 425, I) differ materially from\r\nthe red. They are large, spheroidal, finely granular masses of about\r\n1/2800th of an inch in diameter. In a cubic millimètre of human blood\r\nthere are about 10,000 white corpuscles. They have a lower specific\r\ngravity than the red, have no cell-wall, and their substance mainly\r\nconsists of protoplasm. The internal granular appearance is now\r\nbelieved to be due to a fine intercellular network having small dots\r\nat the intersections of the web. In the meshes of the net a hyaline\r\nsubstance is interspersed. They possess one or more nuclei; these are\r\nseen on the application of a few drops of acetic acid. When examined\r\nin a perfectly fresh state, especially if the glass slide be placed on\r\nthe warm stage of the microscope, they exhibit a spontaneous change\r\nof shape, amœba-like, such movements being accordingly termed amœboid.\r\nThe movements referred to consist in the protrusion of processes\r\nof protoplasm which are retracted and other processes protruded as\r\nrepresented (Fig. 425, I). Both in human blood and in newts there are\r\ncolourless corpuscles which contain coarser granules than others; these\r\nare called granular corpuscles. Some are shown near the amœboid bodies.\r\nThe white corpuscles are readily found in various tissues of the body,\r\nas in the lymphatic glands. In inflammatory diseases these _leucocytes_\r\npass through the walls of the capillaries into the tissues, and form\r\nmorbid products, pus-cells.\r\n\r\nSections of blood discs are made by dipping a fine needle in a drop of\r\nblood as it exudes from a prick of the finger and drawing thin lines\r\nacross the glass slip, allowing time to dry, and then cutting the lines\r\nacross in all directions with a razor. The loosened portions should be\r\nremoved with a camel’s-hair brush.\r\n\r\nIn birds, the blood discs are oval in shape and possess a nucleus,\r\nshown in Fig. 425 B, in the blood of the fowl; this is rendered more\r\napparent on adding a drop of acetic acid. The blood of fishes is also\r\noval and nucleated, rather more pointed than that of birds. In reptiles\r\ngenerally the red blood discs are large, oval, nucleated bodies, the\r\nwhite corpuscles still preserving their invariable circular form and\r\ngranular appearance. In the salamander and proteus the discs attain to\r\ntheir greatest size. In the former they measure 1/700th of an inch, and\r\nin the latter 1/400th.\r\n\r\n_Blood Crystals._--In addition to the elements described, the blood\r\ncontains various crystalline forms, represented in Fig. 425, C to H. In\r\nconnection with the micro-spectroscope (p. 253), the spectra of certain\r\nblood crystals are given; although varying in different animals,\r\nsufficient uniformity prevails as to render them characteristic. The\r\ncrystals are formed when a little blood is mixed with water on the\r\nslide, allowing a short time for crystallisation. Near the edge of the\r\ncover-glass, where crystals begin to form, they are more distinct, but\r\na high power is required for their examination. In human blood the\r\ncrystals are prismatic; in that of the guinea-pig, tetrahedral; in the\r\nblood of the mouse, octahedral. Other forms may be obtained by the aid\r\nof chemical reagents.\r\n\r\nIn human blood there are at least three distinct forms of crystals:\r\n_Hæmatin_ is formed in normal blood, is made visible on the addition\r\nof a little water to blood, or by agitation with ether, so as to\r\ndissolve the cell-wall of the blood corpuscles, and allow the contents\r\nto escape. A drop of blood will furnish crystals large enough to\r\nbe seen with a moderate power. _Hæmatoidin_ crystals are abnormal\r\nproducts, found in connection with certain diseased conditions. These\r\ncrystals are seen as represented at D. _Hæmin_ crystals must be\r\nregarded as artificial chemical products, the result of treating blood\r\nwith glacial acetic acid; the acicular crystals at E, reddish-brown in\r\ncolour, are artificially produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426.\r\n\r\n1. White fibrous or non-elastic tissue; 2. Yellow fibrous elastic\r\ntissue.]\r\n\r\n_Basement Membrane--Connective Tissue System._--Connective or areolar\r\ntissue is present almost throughout the whole of the human body, and\r\nserves to connect the various organs with one another, as well as\r\nto bind together the several parts. The muscles are surrounded by a\r\nconnective tissue sheath; this penetrates into their substance, and\r\nbinds together fasciculi and fibres. The same tissue is present in the\r\nskin and the mucous membranes; it also forms a sheath for the arteries,\r\nveins, and nerves. It is plentifully supplied by blood-vessels, and\r\nnerves pass through its substance. Microscopically, four different\r\nelements can be clearly made out:--1. Connective tissue cells or\r\ncorpuscles; 2. White fibrous tissue; 3. Yellow fibrous tissue; 4.\r\nGround substance.\r\n\r\nOn examining the connective tissue cells of young animals, various\r\ncells will be seen with fine granular contents, together with nuclei,\r\nlying in spaces in the ground substance, some branched, others\r\nflattened or rounded. Even tissues supposed to be homogeneous in\r\nstructure, are on staining seen to have connective tissue cells, such\r\nas those represented in a section of the cornea of the eye (see p. 31).\r\nIn this case the connective tissue cells are termed corneal corpuscles;\r\nthe branched cells, it will be noticed, are united by branches.\r\n\r\nThe cells in the fibrous tissue of tendons are square or oblong, and\r\nform continuous rows. White fibrous tissue is distributed throughout\r\nthe animal body, but in a variety of forms; it is found in the skin and\r\nother membranes, and in all parts where strength and flexibility are\r\nnecessary. The structure of white and yellow fibrous tissues is shown\r\nin Figs. 426 and 427.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427.\r\n\r\n1. White fibrous tissue lining the interior of the egg shell, with the\r\ncalcium carbonate removed by immersion in hydrochloric acid; 2. White\r\nfibrous tissue, from the sclerotic coat of the eye.]\r\n\r\nWhite fibrous tissue presents silver-lustre bundles, running for the\r\nmost part in parallel directions through and over the muscles and\r\ntendons. For examination under the microscope, obtain a fragment of\r\nfresh meat cut in the longitudinal direction; place it in water, and\r\ntease it out with needles as directed in a former chapter. The smallest\r\nfragment will suffice for examination under a quarter or one-sixth inch\r\nobjective. These filaments are exceedingly minute, measuring 1/3000th\r\nto 1/2500th of an inch in diameter, and do not interlace through the\r\nbundles, although they intersect each other occasionally. Transverse\r\nsections may be made by drying a piece of tendon until it becomes\r\nsufficiently firm to cut with a razor or microtome, and mounted as a\r\npermanent specimen. From the cut ends of the fibres small dark points\r\nwill be seen, especially in the denser structure of the tendons; these\r\nare termed “connective tissue corpuscles.”\r\n\r\nYellow elastic fibrous tissue is remarkable in contradistinction to\r\nthe white for its elasticity and capability of extension. It is found\r\non the coats of blood-vessels, between the vertebral arches, and in\r\nquadrupeds it forms a strong elastic band, extending from the occiput,\r\nthroughout the spines of the vertebra, and enabling the animal to\r\nsupport the head in the pendent position, without muscular exertion.\r\nThese fibres can only be separated from each other with difficulty, and\r\ntheir elasticity is shown by a tendency to curl up. These yellow fibres\r\nare somewhat coarser than the white, and they remain unaffected by\r\nacetic acid of the ordinary strength. Elastic tissue is a constituent\r\nof the skin, mucous, and serous membranes, and of the areolar or\r\ncellular tissue.\r\n\r\nIn order to microscopically examine this structure, take a small\r\nportion of the strong ligament of the neck of the ox, place it as\r\nbefore in water, and tease it out with needles; place a fragment on\r\na glass slip, cover with a thin cover-glass, and submit it to a high\r\nmagnifying power. Transverse sections made as directed in the case of\r\nwhite tissue will be seen to be hexagonal in form.\r\n\r\n_Adipose Tissue._--Fat is found in many situations in the animal body,\r\nand on examination is seen to consist entirely of vesicles, distributed\r\nthrough a delicate membrane of connective tissue, shown in Plate XIX.,\r\nNos. 4 and 5. On pressure, the circular or oval form of the cells\r\nbecomes polyhedral; occasionally the fatty acids in the interior of the\r\nvesicles crystallise, and give rise to a star-like appearance. For the\r\nexamination of adipose tissue, take a portion of the mesentery of any\r\nsmall animal--a mouse, or rat.\r\n\r\n_Retiform Tissue._--Adenoid, or retiform tissue, consists of a delicate\r\nnetwork of connective tissue corpuscles, joining their branches\r\ntogether. This forms the stroma or framework of lymphoid tissue. It is\r\nfound in connection with all the lymphatic glands, spleen, &c. Plate\r\nXIX., No. 3, _a b_, shows small sections of a lymphatic, together with\r\ncapillary vessels.\r\n\r\n_Muscular Fibre._--There are two varieties of muscular fibre in the\r\nbody--_i.e._, striated, and non-striated. The striated is formed in\r\nmuscles attached to bony structures, as those of the arm and leg, and\r\nin some of the soft structures, as the tongue, palate, œsophagus, in\r\nshort, all muscles under the control of the will. Striped muscle is of\r\na dull red colour and marked with peculiar longitudinal furrows on its\r\nsurface. Voluntary muscle consists of:--1, a connective tissue sheath;\r\n2, fasciculi; 3, fibres and sarcolemma; 4, discs, fibrilla and sarcous\r\nelements. These are shown in connection with other tissues in Plate\r\nXIX., Nos. 11 and 12, and also in Fig. 428 (1, 2, 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 428.\r\n\r\n1. Muscular fibre broken across, the fragments connected by the\r\nconnective tissue membrane × 100; 2. Fibre broken up into irregular\r\ndistinct bands: a few blood corpuscles distributed about × 200; 3. A\r\nfasciculus of muscular fibre from leg of pig × 600.]\r\n\r\nIn Plate XIX., Fig. 11, the muscular fibre taken from the tongue of\r\na lamb shows the continuity of the upper portion with the connective\r\ntissue membrane. In Fig. 12, a branching-out bundle of muscular fibre,\r\ntaken from the upper lip of the rat, is seen to end in stellate\r\nconnective cells. The delicate homogeneous sheath that binds the fibres\r\ntogether is termed _sarcolemma_. This is readily seen in prepared\r\nmuscle of the frog and water-beetle, less plainly in man. Each muscle\r\nis provided with a sheath of connective tissue; this surrounds it,\r\nbinds the fasciculi together, and supports the blood-vessels; it is\r\ncalled the _perimysium_, and sends fine prolongations in between the\r\nfibres, termed _endomysium_. The intervals seen on high amplification\r\nbetween the dark striæ are called Kruse’s membrane. On breaking up the\r\nstriated structure it is resolvable into fibrillæ and furthermore into\r\ndiscs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429.\r\n\r\n1. Vertical section of epidermis; 2. Pigment cells from a lower layer\r\nof cutis.]\r\n\r\nAmong mammalia the pig furnishes the best examples of muscle fibrillæ;\r\namong insects the water-beetle and the thorax of the housefly. A\r\npower of 600 or 800 diameters is required to separate the fibrillæ.\r\nBlood-vessels are well supplied with striated muscle, but none of\r\ntheir minuter branches penetrate the sarcolemma. The involuntary or\r\nnon-striated variety of muscular fibre exists in all parts of the body\r\nwhere movements occur independently of the will, also in the ciliary\r\nmuscle and the iris of the eye, as well as in the middle coats of the\r\narteries. Non-striated fibres are pale in colour, prismatic in shape,\r\nand easily flattened by pressure. In size, they vary from 1/7000th to\r\n1/3500th of an inch in diameter, and are marked at short intervals by\r\noblong corpuscles.\r\n\r\n_The Integument or Skin_ consists of epidermis or cuticle, dermis,\r\ncorium or cutis vera, sweat-glands, nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and\r\nnumerous nerves and vessels. The epidermis forms a protective covering\r\nover the whole surface of the body, and is moulded on to the surface\r\nof the corium beneath, covering the ridges, depressions and papillæ.\r\nIt is made up of three principal layers: the horny layer or _stratium\r\ncorneum_, the most superficial, this consists of layers of flattened\r\ncells, which are without a nucleus; the _stratum lucidum_, composed\r\nof layers of nucleated cells, more or less indistinct in section; the\r\n_rete mucosum_ or malpighian layer; is composed in its upper part of\r\nlayers of “prickle cells” and its inferior of a single stratum of\r\ncolumnar cells. Pigment is principally found in the lowest layer, Fig.\r\n429.\r\n\r\nThe gradations of colour in the skin are due to the granular contents\r\nof the pigment cells. This is seen on steeping sections cut from the\r\nskin of a negro in chlorine; the colour is discharged. In Plate XIX.,\r\nNo. 13, the pigment cells of the choroid coat of eye are shown. Here\r\nthe pigment is darker in colour, and its function is the absorption of\r\nlight and the prevention of disturbing effects occasioned by circles of\r\ndispersion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430.--Vertical section of skin and subcutaneous\r\ntissues, showing the sweat-glands and fat-globules, ducts passing\r\nupwards to the epidermis or external cuticle. Magnified 250 diameters.]\r\n\r\n_The Dermis_, or true skin, consists of an interlacing network of\r\nconnective tissue, yellow elastic tissue corpuscles, vessels, and\r\nnerves. There are also small muscular fibres in connection with the\r\nhair follicles, and beneath the subcutaneous tissues contain an\r\nabundant supply of fat adipose tissue. Numerous ridges are seen on\r\nthe surface, especially on the palm of the hand and sole of the foot,\r\ncaused by rows of little elevations of the cutis vera, termed papillæ.\r\nThese are more or less conical, and contain a capillary loop, nerve,\r\nand touch corpuscle, which serve to increase the sensitiveness of the\r\npart, lodging a touch corpuscle in a favourable position for receiving\r\nsensations of touch, Fig. 430.\r\n\r\nSweat glands are situated in the subcutaneous tissue, and consist\r\nof fine tubes, which form the duct (seen in the section, Fig. 430);\r\nthese are continuous with a blind extremity, coiled up into a ball\r\none-sixtieth of an inch in diameter, and surrounded by a plexus of\r\ncapillaries to form the gland (Fig. 431, No. 2). Between the layer of\r\ncolumnar cells and the limiting membrane is a layer of non-striated\r\nmuscle, and beneath the rite mucosum there are several layers of\r\npolyhedral cells, and an external and internal limiting membrane; the\r\nepithelium of the duct is at its mouth continuous with the epithelium\r\nof the epidermis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431.\r\n\r\n1. Blood vessels of papillæ supplied to cutis; 2. Perpendicular section\r\nthrough the scalp, with two hair-sacs; _a._ epidermis; _b._ cutis; _c._\r\nmuscles of the hair follicles.]\r\n\r\n_Nails_ consist of a root and body, the lunular of which is the\r\nwhitish portion of the body near the root, where the skin beneath is\r\nless vascular than any other portion of the finger. The nail closely\r\nresembles the epidermis, and consists of hard and thin layers of cells\r\non the surface, and round, moist cells beneath. Posteriorly the nail\r\nfits into a groove which lodges its root. The part to which the nail is\r\nattached is known as the nail-bed. The stratified appearance produced\r\nby the coalescence of the cells, and their lying over each other, is\r\nshown in Plate VII., No. 149, the toe of the mouse; while the special\r\narrangement of tissue is better seen under polarised light (Plate\r\nVIII., No. 174).\r\n\r\n_Hairs_ consist of a shaft and root. The shaft is cylindrical, and\r\ncovered with a layer of imbricated scales, arranged with their edges\r\nupwards. The substance of the hair consists of fibres, or elongated\r\nfusiform cells, in which nuclei are seen. There are present in some\r\nhairs (Fig. 432) small air spaces or lacunæ. In the coarser hair of the\r\nbody there is a pith (medulla), occupied by small angular cells and fat\r\ngranules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432.\r\n\r\n1. Single Hair-root and Shaft; 2. Vertical section, showing fibrous\r\ncharacter of the hair together with colouring matter, external edges\r\nserrated; 3. Transverse section of human hair, medullary substance, and\r\ncentral pith.]\r\n\r\nThe root of the hair is seen to dilate that it may fit more firmly into\r\nthe skin hair-follicle. The latter consists of two coats, an outer\r\nand an inner, continuous with the epidermis, and this is called the\r\nroot sheath. The outer portion consists of three layers, formed of\r\nconnective tissue, blood-vessels, and nerves. The inner, or epidermic,\r\ncoat comes away when the hair is pulled out, and hence is called\r\nthe root sheath. This again is made up of two layers, the outer of\r\nwhich corresponds with the horny layer, and is composed of flattened\r\ncells. The bulbous root of the hair is connected with the papilla.\r\nIn the cat the tactile nasal hairs are very large. Small bundles of\r\ninvoluntary muscular fibres connect the corium with the root, so that\r\nin contracting they elevate or expand the hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433.\r\n\r\n1. Jointed hairs of Indian bat; 2. Hair of flying-fox, showing\r\nimbricated scales; 3. Hair of mouse, showing pigment layers; 4. Hair of\r\na small beetle (Dermestes). × 250.]\r\n\r\nThe hair of the lower animals presents a diversity of structure,\r\nespecially on the outer surface, and with reference to the arrangement\r\nof the scales. The hair of the Indian bat, for instance, consists of a\r\nshaft invested with erectile scales, placed at regular intervals; these\r\nstand out from the shaft, as in Fig. 433, No. 1. This form of scale\r\nvaries considerably in the different species of these animals, and a\r\nportion of hair near the root is nearly divested of scales. Many of\r\nthe scales are not unlike those of certain of the insect tribe, seen\r\nin that of Dermestes, No. 3, while the hair of the mouse has a series\r\nof transverse imbricated scales arranged as tiles on a house, due to\r\naccumulated pigment. Hairs taken from various animals form interesting\r\nobjects of study for the microscope, as already noticed. Other hairs\r\nare shown in Fig. 434. No. 1 is a transverse section of a hair from\r\nthe ant-eater; the central part consists of air-cells, the outer of a\r\ngranular pith. No. 2 is a transverse section of hair of peccary, with\r\na diversified arrangement of the cortical envelope, sending outward\r\na set of radial prolongations and air-cells; this kind of structure\r\nis also found in the quills of the porcupine. No. 3 is a transverse\r\nsection of a hair of the elephant, which shows a combination of a\r\nnumber of tubes united together, somewhat resembling the arrangement\r\nof the hoof-horn of some of the ruminants, and the denser horny growth\r\non the snout of the rhinoceros, No. 4. The curious modification of\r\nthese horny structures is seen in the horns of other animals, and which\r\nmay be likened to a bundle of hairs. On making a transverse section,\r\nas in Fig. 434, and submitting it to polarised light, on rotating the\r\nanalyser, the dark central spot shown is replaced by a bright one with\r\na play of colours due to the interference of light (Plate VIII., No.\r\n178). The scales of fish are also of interest (Fig. 435). These have\r\nbeen shown to afford an unerring guide in the classification of fishes\r\nand in the examination of their fossil remains. As a class of objects\r\nfor the microscope, they are found to be both curious and beautiful.\r\nPlate VIII., No. 176, is a scale of the grayling, seen under polarised\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 434.\r\n\r\n1. Hair of ant-eater; 2. Hair of peccary; 3. Hair of elephant; 4. Horn\r\nof Rhinoceros.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435.--Fish Scale (Sole).]\r\n\r\nOf the harder outgrowths of the dermal structures, the teeth afford the\r\nchief example among animals. The rough anatomy of the tooth in mankind\r\nconsists of a crown, that projects from the gum; a root, or fangs,\r\nfixed in a socket of the jawbone, and a short intermediary neck. Each\r\ntooth is supplied with an artery and nerve, and has a central cavity\r\nfilled with a soft, vascular, sensitive substance, the pulp. On making\r\na vertical section of a tooth, we recognise the several structures in\r\nthe order of, pulp, crusta, petrosa, dentine, and enamel. A section\r\nthrough a human molar tooth (shown in Fig. 436) will convey some idea\r\nof the arrangement of the denser structures referred to above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 436.--Sections of Human Molar Tooth (magnified 50\r\ndiameters). 1. Vertical section; 2. Horizontal section.]\r\n\r\nBlandin was the first to demonstrate that teeth are developed in the\r\nmucous membrane, similar to that of hair and nails. Teeth are formed in\r\ngrooves of the mucous membrane, and subsequently converted into closed\r\nsacs by a process of involution, and their final adhesion to the jaw\r\nis a later process. It is very generally conceded that teeth belong\r\nto the _muco-dermoid_, and not to the periosteal, series of tissues;\r\nthat, instead of standing in close relation to the endo-skeleton, they\r\nare part of the dermal or exo-skeleton; their true analogues being the\r\nhair, and some other epidermic appendages. Huxley proved that, although\r\nteeth are developed in two ways, they are mere varieties of the usual\r\nmode in the animal kingdom. In the first, which is typified by the\r\nmackerel and the frog, the pulp is never free, but from the first is\r\ninclosed within the capsule, seeming to sink down as fast as it grows.\r\nIn the other, the pulp projects freely at one period above the surface\r\nof the mucous membrane, becoming subsequently included within a capsule\r\nformed by the involution of the latter; this occurs in the human\r\nsubject. The skate offers a sort of intermediate structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437.\r\n\r\n1. Section of a cusp of the posterior molar of a child. The inner\r\noutline represents it before the addition of acetic acid--the outer\r\nafterwards, when Nasmyth’s membrane _g_ is seen raised up in folds;\r\n_f._ the enamel organ; _c._ the dentine; the central portion being\r\nfilled with pulp. 2.

Decalcified tooth-structure; _a._ the dentine; _b._ enamel\r\norgan; _c._ enamel; _d._ Nasmyth’s membrane.]\r\n\r\nThe _enamel_ forms a continuous layer, and invests the crown of the\r\ntooth; it is thickest upon the masticating surface, and decreases\r\ntowards the neck, where it usually terminates. The external surface\r\nof the enamel appears smooth, but is always marked by delicate\r\nelevations and transverse ridges, and covered by a fine membrane\r\n(Nasmyth’s membrane), containing calcareous matter. This membrane is\r\nseparable after being subjected to hydrochloric acid; it then appears\r\nlike a network of areolar tissue, shown in Fig. 438, No. 6; Huxley’s\r\n“_calcified membrana_,” which commence at the pulp cavity, and pass up\r\nto the enamel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438.--Tooth Structure.\r\n\r\n1. Longitudinal section of superior canine tooth, exhibiting general\r\narrangement, and contour markings, slightly magnified; 2 and 3.\r\nPortions from same, highly magnified, showing the relative position of\r\nbone-cells, cementum at 2, dentine fibres, and commencement of enamel\r\nat 3; 4.

A transverse section of\r\nenamel, showing the sheaths of fibres, contents removed, and magnified\r\n300 diameters.]\r\n\r\nCzermak discovered that the curious appearances of globular\r\nconglomerate formations in the substance of dentine depend on its\r\nmode of _calcification_ and the presence of earthy material; and he\r\nattributed the contour lines to the same cause. Contour markings vary\r\nin intensity and number; they are most abundant in the root, and most\r\nmarked in the crown. Vertical sections exhibit them the best; as Fig.\r\n440, No. 1. In preparing a specimen, first make the section accurately,\r\nthen decalcify it by submersion in dilute hydrochloric acid; dry it and\r\nmount in Canada balsam; place the specimen in the hot chamber for some\r\ntime to soak in the fluid resin before it cools. The white opacity at\r\nthe extremity of the contour markings gives the appearance of rings to\r\nthe tooth-fang.\r\n\r\n“The tooth-substance appears,” says Czermak, “on its inner surface, not\r\nas a symmetrical whole, but consisting of balls of various diameter,\r\nwhich are fused together into a mass with one another in different\r\ndegrees, and in which the dentine tubes in contact with the germ\r\ncavity terminate. By reflected light, _dark-ground_ illumination, one\r\nperceives this stalactite-like condition of the inner surface of the\r\ntooth-substance very distinctly, by means of the varied illumination of\r\nthe globular elevations, and by the shadows which they cast.” To see\r\nthis structure to advantage the preparation should be made from a tooth\r\nroot, the growth of which is not complete. With such preparations,\r\nthe ground-substance of the last formed layer of the tooth-substance\r\nis seen to be, at least partly, in the form of globular masses, fused\r\ntogether with those of the penultimate layers.\r\n\r\nThe cementum is the cortical layer of osseous tissue, forming an outer\r\ncoating to the fangs, which it sometimes cements together. Its internal\r\nsurface is intimately united with the _dentine_, and in many teeth it\r\nwould appear as if the earliest determined arrangement of the fibres\r\nof the dentine started from the _canaliculi_, as they radiate from the\r\nlacunæ in the cement. The inter-lacunar layer is often striated, and\r\nexhibits a laminated structure: sometimes it appears as if Haversian\r\ncanals were running in a perpendicular direction to the pulp cavity.\r\nThe _canaliculi_ frequently run out into numerous branches, connecting\r\none with another, and anastomising with the ends of the dentine fibres.\r\nThe thick layers of cement which occur in old teeth show immense\r\nquantities of aggregated lacunæ of an irregular and elongated form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 439.--Transverse section of Tooth of Pristis, showing orifices of\r\nmedullary canals, with systems of radiating fibres (_tubuli_) analogous\r\nto the Haversian canals in true bone.]\r\n\r\n_Compact Tissues, Cartilage and Bone._--Cartilage is a bluish or\r\nyellowish-white, semi-transparent, elastic substance, without vessels\r\nor nerves, and surrounded by a membrane, termed pericondrium, of a\r\ndense fibrous nature. That kind, however, known as articular cartilage,\r\nreceives a layer of epithelium from the synovial membrane, but this\r\nis confined to marginal portions, in consequence of the central wear\r\nwhich occurs as soon as the parts are subjected to friction, during\r\nthe movement of the limbs. Cartilage covers the ends of all bones in\r\napposition to form joints, and thus lessens the effects of concussion.\r\nBesides the ordinary kind of cartilage, temporary and permanent, there\r\nare two modifications of the tissue, confined to certain portions of\r\nthe body: cellular cartilage, composed of cells lying close together,\r\nin a mesh formed of fine fibres; and fibro-cartilage, cells distributed\r\nin a matrix of fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nExamined with a low power, cartilage appears to be homogeneous in\r\nstructure, studded over with numerous round, oval, oblong, semilunar,\r\nand irregular-shaped corpuscles, as seen in Plate XIX., No. 8, a\r\nvertical section of animal cartilage, arranged in columns, and\r\ncondensed at the lower surface previous to its conversion into bone.\r\nThe greater opacity of this portion is owing to the increase of osseous\r\nfibres, and the multiplication of oil globules, and the intercellular\r\nspaces becoming filled with vessels. No. 9 shows a small transverse\r\nsection of the same, with a further change of the cartilage cells at\r\n_a_ into bone cells, and at _b_ with the characteristic canaliculi and\r\nlacunæ. No. 7 further shows a section of the large tendon fixed to the\r\nback of the heel of the foot, near the juncture of the tendo-Archillis\r\nwith the cartilage. For the examination of these several changes a high\r\npower is necessary, and for the purpose pieces taken from the ox may be\r\neasily obtained from the butcher, and fine sections cut with a razor\r\nparallel to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 440.\r\n\r\n1. Cartilage from a mouse’s ear closely resembling vegetable tissue\r\n×200; 2. Cartilage from rabbit’s ear, with nucleated cells embedded in\r\nmatrix; 3. Cartilage from the end of a human rib ×300.]\r\n\r\nThe better specimens for microscopical examination are those taken from\r\nvery young animals, in whom the ossific process is still incomplete. In\r\norder to examine cellular cartilage, the ear of the mouse should be\r\ntaken and just dried sufficiently to enable fine sections to be cut by\r\nthe microtome transversely (Fig. 440).\r\n\r\nCartilage forms the entire skeleton of a certain number of fishes, as\r\nthe skate, lamprey, ray, shark, &c., the cells of which are embedded\r\nin a matrix of granular matter, which has been properly termed\r\nintercellular. The nearest approach to ossification of cartilage in\r\nfishes is that of the cuttle-fish; in this stellate cells are freely\r\ndistributed, as shown in Fig. 441, No. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441.\r\n\r\n1. Cartilage from the head of the skate, cells filled with nuclei;\r\n2. Cartilage from frog, oblong cells with nuclei; 3. Cartilage from\r\ncuttle-fish, with stellate cells, × 200.]\r\n\r\nWhite fibro-cartilage occurs between the bodies of the vertebræ as a\r\nconnecting medium. In this kind the cells are more widely distributed,\r\nspecimens of which may be taken from the central portion of an\r\ninterarticular disc of any animal. The oval or circular corpuscles will\r\nbe seen surrounded by an abundance of fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance with the degeneration of the textures with which we\r\nhave been dealing may be of service to the student, as he may, in the\r\ncourse of his examination, meet with an abnormal condition altogether\r\ndifferent to those described. The process of degeneration is usually\r\na slow one, except in the case of fatty infiltration, an example of\r\nwhich is furnished by the fatty degeneration of the liver in Strasburg\r\ngeese. Muscular tissue is very prone to fatty degeneration, and fatty\r\nheart is often met with. Calcareous degeneration of the muscles,\r\nligaments, and cartilages, as well as morbid deposits, are not at all\r\nuncommon in these structures. In Plate XIX., No. 9, a small section\r\nis given of an enchondroma, and in which the round or ovoid cells of\r\nthe cartilage are seen degenerated and converted into granular masses\r\nof a calcareous nature. Fig. 442 is a somewhat more highly magnified\r\nsection of a calcareous or morbid growth, taken from a human subject in\r\nwhich a morbid growth was seen to be gradually destroying the bone and\r\ncartilage cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFig. 442.--Cartilage taken from a diseased finger, in which both\r\ncartilage and bone were in a state of degeneration.]\r\n\r\n_Bone._--Bone is a hard unyielding structure, and which in the\r\nvertebrata forms the skeleton of the adult. It is the framework for the\r\nsupport of the soft tissues of the body, and forms various cavities for\r\nthe reception of important organs, as the brain, spinal cord, eyes,\r\nheart and lungs, and acts as levers for the action of the muscles and\r\njoints. The partial elasticity of bone is seen in the ribs, and the\r\nrebound when the skull is dropped on the ground. Bone consists of\r\nearthy and animal matters intimately combined; the removal of either,\r\nhowever, does not destroy the form of the bone, if the process of\r\nseparation be carefully conducted. The earthy constituents may all\r\nbe dissolved out by hydrochloric acid, but the form of the bone is\r\npreserved in its minute particular, and in this state sections may\r\nbe cut for microscopical examination. If allowed to become dry it\r\nshrivels, and assumes the density of horn. The interior of a bone is\r\nof a spongy or cancellated structure, particularly at the ends. The\r\nouter portion of the bone is more dense than the internal part. The\r\nstudy of bone should commence with sections of the softened structure.\r\nDirections for making sections of bone are given in the chapter on\r\nPractical Microscopy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATA, BONE STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\nThe intimate structure of bone will be studied in connection with Plate\r\nXX. Two series of lamellæ may be demonstrated in bone after maceration\r\nin acid, a larger system surrounding the medullary canal, and a smaller\r\nsurrounding the Haversian canals, both of which are seen in Nos. 1 and\r\n2. In macerating bones, the lamellæ of the layer concentric system\r\nmay be peeled off in layers; these are seen to be pierced with fine\r\napertures, caused by the canaliculi. In some parts larger apertures\r\nare seen through which bundles of fibres pass, pinning, as it were,\r\nthe several layers together; these are the perforating fibres. The\r\noutermost of the layers, being near the periosteum, the membrane\r\ncovering the bone, are termed periosteal layers; the innermost, being\r\nclose to the canal, are called medullary layers. No. 1 is a transverse\r\nsection of a flat bone, the clavicle, and it shows the Haversian\r\ncanals, varying in size from 1/2000th to 1/200th of an inch in\r\ndiameter, the largest being near the medullary canal. In shape they are\r\nround, oval, or oblong, according to the line of section. Each canal\r\nis surrounded by rings, none of which are complete, and running one\r\ninto the other at various parts. Under a higher power, those irregular\r\nshaped bodies termed lacunæ, with fine radiating fibres, are seen to be\r\nsmaller canals, canaliculi.\r\n\r\nBy means of this complete and intricate distribution of the canals of\r\nthe Haversian system, the nutritive fluids pass into the most compact\r\nparts of the osseous tissue. Longitudinal sections of the long bones\r\nshow these canals as continuous branching-out cells.\r\n\r\nIn many of the lower animals the bony structure differs from those of\r\nman, as will be seen in Plate XX. No. 3 shows a transverse section of\r\nthe femur, or leg-bone of an ostrich, magnified ninety-five times,\r\nin which the Haversian canals are much smaller and more numerous,\r\nand many of them run in the transverse direction. No. 4, again, is\r\na transverse section of the humerus, or fore-arm bone of a turtle\r\n(_Chelonia mydas_). This exhibits traces of Haversian canals, with a\r\nslight tendency to a concentric arrangement of bone-cells around them,\r\nthe bone-cells being large and numerous, and occur, for the most part,\r\nin parallel rows. In No. 5, a horizontal section of the lower jaw-bone\r\nof a conger-eel exhibits a single plane of bone-cells arranged in\r\nparallel lines. There are no Haversian canals present, and when this\r\nspecimen is contrasted with that of No. 4, it will be noticed that\r\nthe canaliculi given off from each of the bone-cells of this fish are\r\nvery few in number in comparison with that of the reptile. No. 6 is a\r\nsection of a portion of the cranium of a siren (_Siren lacertina_),\r\nremarkable for the large size of the bone-cells, and of the canaliculi,\r\nwhich are larger in this animal than in any other yet examined; and as\r\nin the preceding specimen, no Haversian canals are present. No. 7 is a\r\nsection of bone taken from the exterior of the shaft of the humerus of\r\na Pterodactyle; this exhibits the elongated bone-cells characteristic\r\nof the order Reptilia. No. 8 is a horizontal section of a scale, or\r\nflattened spine, from the skin of a Trygon, or sting ray; this exhibits\r\nlarge Haversian canals, with numerous wavy parallel tubes, like those\r\nof dentine, communicating with them. This specimen shows, besides wavy\r\ntubes, numerous bone-cells, whose canaliculi communicate with the\r\ntubes, as in dentine.\r\n\r\nThe following points may be noted with regard to the several sections\r\nof bone described. That of the bird, for instance, contrasted with that\r\nof the mammal, exhibits the following peculiarities: the Haversian\r\ncanals are more abundant, much smaller, and often run in a direction\r\nat right angles to that of the shaft, by which means the concentric\r\nlaminated arrangement is in some cases lost; the direction of the\r\ncanals follows the curve of the bone; the bone-cells are much smaller\r\nand more numerous; while the number of canaliculi sent off from the\r\ncells is less than in those of mammals. No. 3 is the average length of\r\na bone-cell of the ostrich, 1/2000th of an inch, in breadth 1/6000th.\r\n\r\nIn the Reptilia, the bones may be either hollow, cancellated, or solid;\r\nand their specific gravity is less than that of birds or mammals. The\r\nshort bones of most of the chelonian reptiles are solid, and the long\r\nbones are either hollow or cancellated; the ribs of the serpent-tribe\r\nare hollow, the medullary cavity performing the office of a Haversian\r\ncanal; the bone-cells are accordingly arranged in concentric circles\r\naround their canals. The vertebræ of these animals are solid; and\r\nthe bone, like that of certain birds, is remarkable for density and\r\nwhiteness. When a transverse section is taken from one of the long\r\nbones, and contrasted with that of a mammal or bird, the difference\r\nwill be noticed; there are very few, if any, Haversian canals, and\r\nthese are large; and at one view, in the section, No. 7, the canals\r\nand bone-cells are arranged both vertically and longitudinally. The\r\nbone-cells are remarkable for the great size to which they attain; in\r\nthe turtle they are 1/375th of an inch in length, the canaliculi are\r\nextremely numerous, and are of a size proportionate to that of the\r\nbone-cell.\r\n\r\nIn fishes a greater variation occurs in the minute structure of\r\nthe skeleton than in either of the three preceding classes. A rare\r\nstructure is that of the sword of the sword-fish (Istiophorus). In\r\nthis, Haversian canals and a concentric laminated arrangement of the\r\nbone are found, but no bone-cells. The Haversian canals, when they are\r\npresent, are of large size, and very numerous, and then the bone-cells\r\nare, generally speaking, either absent or but few in number, their\r\nplace being occupied by tubes or canaliculi, which are often of a\r\nvery large size. The bone-cells are remarkable for their graduate\r\nfigure, and the canaliculi derived from them are comparatively few in\r\nnumber. In a thin section of the scale of an osseous fish, the cells\r\nlie nearly all in one plane, and the anastomoses of the canaliculi are\r\nmore distinctly seen; in the hard scales of many, as the Lepidosteus\r\nand Calicthys, and in spines of the Siluridæ, the bone-cells are well\r\ndifferentiated. In the true bony scales comprising the exo-skeleton of\r\ncartilaginous fishes the bone-cells are seen in great numbers.\r\n\r\nNow, if we proceed at once to the application of the facts which have\r\nbeen laid down, and make a fragment of bone of an extinct animal\r\nthe subject of investigation, it will be found that the bone-cells\r\nin Mammalia are tolerably uniform in size; and if we take 1/2000th\r\nof an inch as a standard, the bone-cells of birds fall below that\r\nstandard; but the bone-cells of reptiles are much above either of\r\nthe two preceding, while those of fishes are essentially different,\r\nboth in size and shape, and are not likely to be mistaken for one or\r\nthe other; so that the determination of a minute yet characteristic\r\nfragment of fishes’ bone is a task easily performed. If the portion of\r\nbone does not exhibit bone-cells, but presents either one or other of\r\nthe characters indicated, the task of discrimination is equally easy.\r\nWe have now the mammal, the bird, and the reptile to deal with. In\r\nconsequence of the very great size of the cells and their canaliculi\r\nin the reptile, a portion of bone of one of these animals can readily\r\nbe distinguished from that of a bird, or a mammal. The only difficulty\r\nlies between these two last; but, notwithstanding that on a cursory\r\nglance the bone of a bird appears very like that of a mammal, there are\r\ncertain points in their minute structure in which they differ; and one\r\nis the difference in size of the bone-cells. To determine accurately,\r\ntherefore, between the two, we must, if the section be a transverse\r\none, also note the comparative sizes of the Haversian canals, and\r\nthe tortuosity of their course; for the diameter of the canal bears\r\na certain proportion to the size of the bone-cells, and after close\r\nexamination the eye will readily detect differences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443.\r\n\r\n1. A portion of the web of frog’s foot, spread out and slightly\r\nmagnified to show distribution of blood-vessels; 2. Is a portion\r\nmagnified 250 diameters to show the ovoid form of the blood discs in a\r\nvessel, beneath which hexagonal nucleated epithelium cells appear.]\r\n\r\n_Arteries and Veins._--The circulation of the animal frame is\r\nmaintained by arteries, veins, and capillaries. The arteries are\r\nelastic and contractile tubes; these convey the blood from the heart\r\nto the capillaries. The larger arteries are exceedingly elastic,\r\nbut feebly contractile on account of the muscular tissue in their\r\nwalls. The veins ramify throughout the body, are more numerous than\r\nthe arteries, and of greater capacity. They usually accompany the\r\narteries and correspond to them in structure, the larger veins\r\npossessing semi-lunar valves; these project into their interiors, and\r\nthus prevent the regurgitation of the blood. They have four coats,\r\nconsisting of areolar tissue, yellow fibres combined with muscular\r\nfibres, and white fibrous tissue, two layers of yellow fibres arranged\r\nlongitudinally, and a single layer of epithelial cells. Intermediate\r\nbetween the arteries and veins there are exceedingly fine tubes, termed\r\ncapillaries, in which the arteries terminate, and from which the veins\r\narise. These are composed of a fine homogeneous membrane, with here and\r\nthere a nucleus. The capillary circulation of the blood is readily seen\r\nin the tail of the newt and the foot of the frog, Fig. 443.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 444.--A network of capillaries.]\r\n\r\nA network of capillaries conveying blood to the lungs, and ramifying\r\nthroughout the structure, is shown in Fig. 444, and in Plate XIX., No.\r\n6, the termination of a capillary of a blood-vessel in the fat-cells of\r\nthe human body. Plate VII. illustrates the distribution of the arteries\r\nand veins to various parts of the animal body. This coloured plate,\r\nhowever, is designed to show the value of injected preparations in\r\nthe delineation of animal structures. By thus artificially restoring\r\nthe blood and distending the tissues, a much better idea is obtained\r\nof the relative condition of parts, the appearance presented by the\r\nerectile papillæ, &c. In the section of foot of mouse (No. 149), the\r\nbone is seen surrounded by its vascular supply, arterial and venous;\r\nin No. 150, the papillæ of the tongue are distended and seen erect; in\r\nNo. 152, a vertical section of the fungi-form papillæ on the tongue of\r\ncat, with capillary loops passing into them, is demonstrated; in No.\r\n151, the vertical section of brain of a rat, the vascular supply is\r\nshown; No. 153, the malpighian tufts (circular bodies) and arteries\r\nramifying about the structure; in No. 154, the vertical section through\r\nthe intestine of the rat, shows villi (arteries and veins) surmounted\r\nby epithelium, and supported on a layer of the mucous membrane; in\r\nNo. 155, the vascular supply sent to the roots of the whisker of the\r\nnose of the mouse; in No. 157, a tangential section cut through the\r\nseveral textures, the sclerotic coat and retina of the eye of a cat\r\nis clearly made out although not highly magnified; again, in No. 156,\r\nthe beautiful vascular arrangement of the internal gill of the tadpole\r\ncould scarcely be so strikingly illustrated in any other way; while in\r\nthe central, No. 158, the vascular system throughout the whole of the\r\nbody of a fully developed tadpole, with the way in which the blood is\r\ncarried from the remotest part of the tail to the heart, and sent to\r\nthe gills, the brain, &c., it is quite unnecessary to enlarge upon.\r\nThese are seen under a low power, but for the purpose of studying\r\nthe basement membrane, together with the intimate association and\r\ntermination of the nerves accompanying the arteries and veins, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to resort to a staining process, and cutting fine\r\nsections with the microtome. Small portions of a nerve may be cut off\r\nwith fine scissors, teased out with needles, and a drop of acetic\r\nacid added to render the sheath more transparent; in a few seconds\r\nthe connective tissue corpuscles will be brought into view. For the\r\nmicroscopical examination of nerve-fibrillæ take a small section from\r\nthe leg of a frog, and tease it out in blood serum or white of egg. In\r\nsize the fibrillæ vary, even in the same nerve, from the 1/12000th to\r\nthe 1/1500th of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 445.]\r\n\r\nTo show the circulation of the blood in the frog’s foot, and without\r\ncausing the animal pain or much inconvenience, it is better to\r\nenclose it in a black silk bag, and draw out the foot as shown at _a\r\na a_, Fig. 445. The bag provided should be from three to four inches\r\nin length, and two and a half inches broad, shown at _b b_, having\r\na piece of tape, _c c_, sewn to each side, about midway between the\r\nmouth and the bottom, and the mouth itself capable of being closed\r\nby a drawing-in string, _d d_. Into this bag the frog is placed, and\r\nonly the leg which is about to be examined kept outside; the string\r\n_d d_ must then be drawn sufficiently tight around the small part of\r\nthe leg to prevent the foot from being pulled into the bag, but not to\r\nstop the circulation; three short pieces of thread, _f f f_, are now\r\npassed around the three principal toes; and the bag with the frog must\r\nbe fastened to the plate _a a_ by means of the tapes _c c_. When this\r\nis accomplished, the threads _f f f_ are passed either through some of\r\nthe holes in the edge of the plate, three of which are shown at _g g\r\ng_, in order to keep the web open; or, what answers better, in a series\r\nof pegs of the shape represented by _h_, each having a slit, _i_,\r\nextending more than halfway down it; the threads are wound round these\r\ntwo or three times, and then the end is secured by putting it into the\r\nslit _i_. The plate is now ready to be adapted to the stage of the\r\nmicroscope: the square opening over which the foot is secured must be\r\nbrought over the aperture in the stage through which the light passes\r\nfrom the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe tadpole circulation is readily seen by placing the creature on its\r\nback, when we immediately observe the beating heart, a bulbous-looking\r\ncavity, formed of delicate, transparent tissue, through which the blood\r\nalternately enters by one orifice and leaves by a more distant exit.\r\nThe heart, it will be noticed, is enclosed within its pericardium,\r\nthis being the more delicate part of the creature’s organisation.\r\nThe binocular microscope should be used for viewing the circulation.\r\nPassing along the course of the great blood-vessels to the right\r\nand left of the heart, the eye is arrested by a large oval body,\r\nof a more complicated structure. This is the inner gill, formed of\r\ndelicate, transparent tissue, traversed by arteries, and a network\r\nof blood-vessels. It is almost unnecessary to say the tadpole has a\r\nrespiratory and circulatory system resembling those of fishes.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all fish the heart has but two cavities, an auricle and\r\nventricle; the blood is returned by the veins to the auricle, passes\r\ninto the ventricle, and is then transmitted to the gills, where, being\r\nexposed to the air contained in the water, it becomes deprived of\r\ncarbonic acid, aerated, and rendered fit to breathe. In the reptile we\r\nfind a modification of plan. The heart has three cavities, two auricles\r\nand one ventricle; by this contrivance there is a perpetual mixture in\r\nthe heart of the impure carbonized blood which has already circulated\r\nthrough the body, and flows into the ventricle from the _right_\r\nauricle, with the purer aerated blood returned from the lungs, which\r\nflows at the same instant into the ventricle from the _left_ auricle.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of subsequent observations the tadpole should be\r\nselected at a period in which the skin is perfectly transparent,\r\notherwise the appearances already described of the form and situation\r\nof the heart, and the three great arterial trunks (proceeding right and\r\nleft), will not be clearly made out. The anatomical arrangement of the\r\nvessels will be seen to be closely connected with the corresponding\r\ngill, the upper one (the _cephalic_) running along the upper edge of\r\nthe gill, giving off, in its course, a branch which ascends to the\r\nmouth, with its accompanying vein; this is termed the _labial_ artery\r\nand vein. The cephalic artery continues its course around the gill,\r\nuntil it suddenly curves upwards and backwards, and reaches the upper\r\nsurface of the head, when it dips down between the eye and the brain.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that this can be made out in the average\r\ntadpole, the obstacle to which is the large coil of intestines, usually\r\ndistended with dark-coloured food. This must first be reduced by making\r\nyour tadpole live on plain water for some days. Plate VII., No. 158,\r\naffords a view of the vessels obtained under the influence of low diet,\r\nand whereby we are enabled to trace the course of the three large\r\narteries. The third trunk, traversing the lung, is seen to emerge from\r\nthe lower edge and descend into the abdomen to form the great abdominal\r\naorta. A small half-starved tadpole shows the heart beating and the\r\nblood circulating, but the latter is quite colourless, not a single red\r\nglobule visible anywhere. The heart is a colourless globe, the gills\r\ntwo transparent ovals, and the intestines a colourless, transparent\r\ncoil. Through the empty coil the artery is seen on either side leaving\r\nthe gills, and converging towards the spine, and uniting to form the\r\nabdominal aorta, the large central vessel coloured red in the figure.\r\nAfter the aorta has supplied the abdominal viscera, a prolongation,\r\nor _caudal_ artery is seen descending to the tail, the all-important\r\norgan of locomotion in the tadpole. This artery, entering the root\r\nof the tail, is imbedded deeply in the flesh, whence it emerges, and\r\nthen continues its course, closely accompanied by the vein, to within\r\na short distance of the extremity, where, being reduced to a state\r\nof extreme fineness, it terminates in a capillary loop, composed of\r\nthe end of the artery and the beginning of the vein. The artery, in\r\nits course, gives off branches continually to supply the neighbouring\r\ntissue. The blood-current in the tail is often seen, even in the\r\nmain artery or vein, to be sluggish. This occurs independently of\r\nthe heart, which will continue to beat as usual; it happens, because\r\nthe circulation in the tail depends very much on the motion of the\r\norgan. When this is suspended (as in the confined tadpole under the\r\nmicroscope), the blood moves sluggishly, or stops, till the tail\r\nregains its freedom and motion, when the activity of the current is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the arterial system which conveys the blood from the\r\nheart to the extremities, we will now note its return by the veins back\r\nagain to the heart.\r\n\r\nThe caudal vein runs near the artery during the greater part of its\r\ncourse, with its stream of blood _towards_ the heart. This stream is\r\nswollen by perpetual tributaries from numerous vessels. As the vein\r\napproaches the root of the tail it is inclined towards the artery,\r\nand diverges from it at the point of entering the abdomen. Here it\r\napproaches the kidneys and sends off branches, while the main trunk\r\ncontinues its course onward; and, passing upwards behind a coil of\r\nintestine, it approaches the liver, and runs in a curved course along\r\nthe margin of that organ. The blood is now seen to enter the vena\r\ncava by several channels, that converge towards the great vein as it\r\npasses in close proximity to the organ. Beyond the liver the vena cava\r\ncontinues its course upwards and inwards to its termination in the\r\nsinus venosus or rudimentary auricle of the heart. This termination is\r\nthe junction of not less than six distinct venous trunks, incessantly\r\npouring their blood into the heart. The circulation in the fringed lips\r\nforms a most complicated network of vessels, out of which proceeds\r\na vein corresponding to the artery already traced. This descends in\r\na direct course till it joins the principal vein of the head, which\r\ncorresponds to the _jugular_ in the mammalia.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen the blood is driven by the heart into each inner\r\ngill through three large blood-vessels, which arise directly from the\r\n_truncus arteriosus_, and may be called the _afferent vessels of the\r\ngill_. In Plate VII., No. 156, an enlarged view of a gill is shown.\r\n\r\nOn closer examination “each _internal gill_ or entire branchial organ\r\nis seen to consist of cartilaginous arches, with a piece of additional\r\nframework of a triangular form, stretching beyond the arches, composed\r\nof semi-transparent, gelatinous-looking material. These form the\r\nframework of the organ and support upon their upper surface the three\r\nrows of crests with their vascular network, and the main arterial and\r\nvenous trunks lying parallel to and between them. The three systemic\r\narteries arising, right and left, from the _truncus arteriosus_,\r\nenter each gill on its cardiac side, and then follow the course of\r\nthe crests, lying in close proximity to them. The upper of these\r\nbranchial arteries runs alone on the outside of the upper crest, and\r\nanother branch leaving the trunk and passing into the network of the\r\ncrest, whence a returning vessel may be traced carrying back the blood\r\n_across_ the branchial artery, and to a vessel lying close to and\r\ntaking the same course as the artery itself. Carrying the eye along\r\nthe latter vessel we find, at a short distance from the first of these\r\ncrest branches, a second, leaving the main trunk and entering the\r\ncrest, when a corresponding returning vessel conveys the blood across\r\nthe arterial trunk into the vessel lying beside it, as in the former\r\ninstance. A number of these branches may be traced from one crest to\r\nthe other. But it is now seen that the trunk from which these arterial\r\nbranches spring diminishes in size as it proceeds in its course (like\r\nthe gill artery in fishes), while the vessel running parallel to it\r\nand receiving the stream as it returns from the crest enlarges to some\r\nextent. Thus, the artery or _afferent_ vessel which brings the blood\r\nto the gill is large at its entrance, but gradually diminishes and\r\ndwindles to a point at the opposite end of the crest; while the venous\r\nor _efferent_ vessel, beginning as a mere radical, gradually enlarges,\r\nand thus becomes the trunk that conveys the blood out of the gill to\r\nits ultimate destination. This vessel is the _upper branchial vein_ so\r\nlong as it remains in contact with the gill; subsequently it changes\r\nits name on leaving the gill and as it passes upwards for distribution\r\nto the head, when it is designated the _cephalic artery_. The _middle\r\nbranchial artery and vein_ proceed in like manner in connection with\r\nthe middle crest, and the _lower artery and vein_ in connection with\r\nthe lower crest. The middle and lower venous trunks, having reached the\r\nextremity of the crests, curve downwards and inwards, and leave the\r\ngill. The former trunk, converging towards the spine, meets its fellow,\r\nand with it forms the _ventral aorta_. The latter gives origin to the\r\n_pulmonary artery_, and supplies also the integuments of the neck.\r\nCurious and interesting is the final stage of the metamorphosis, when\r\nthe waning tadpole and incipient frog coexist, and are actually seen\r\ntogether in the same subject. The dwindling gills and the shrinking\r\ntail--the last remnants of the tadpole form--are yet seen, in company\r\nwith the coloured, spotted skin, the newly formed and slender legs, the\r\nflat head, the wide and toothless mouth, and the crouching attitude of\r\nthe all but perfect reptile.”[87]\r\n\r\nTo observe the circulation and how it is carried on during life in the\r\ngills, the outer covering must be carefully raised, or even stripped\r\noff. This will be better accomplished by putting the tadpole under the\r\ninfluence of cocaine or chloroform--a drop of the fluid is sufficient\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosis in the embryo of the frog is by no means exceptional.\r\nThe ascidian begins life in the form of a tadpole, with a muscular\r\ntail; subsequently it fixes itself by its head to a rock, and its tail\r\ndisappears. The changes the tadpole of the frog passes through are in\r\nevery respect, except in one or two minor details, similar to those of\r\nadult amphibia which pass their whole lives in water. The newly-hatched\r\nflat-fish is symmetrical, an eye being placed on each side of its head,\r\nwith the adults of other fishes. The fœtal whale has well-developed\r\nhind limbs, and which, after passing into a condition almost perfect in\r\nproportion to the rest of the body, gradually dwindle away again to the\r\nmerest rudimentary structures. In all these, and a number of similar\r\ncases, it is seen that the earlier condition of existing animals\r\nrepresents, and is in agreement with that of its adult ancestor of a\r\nremote period in the past. Collected facts bearing upon this question\r\nhave been made the groundwork of a theory of hereditary properties in\r\nthe germ, and a disposition to go through the same phases of life as\r\nthe parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Mineral and Geological Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure of rocks and the formation of crystals will be found to\r\nfurnish an endless supply of instructive material for the microscope.\r\nIn sciences of pure observation, as those of mineralogy and geology,\r\nthe facts to be observed are of several different kinds, and where\r\nso many observers are at work all over the world, constant progress\r\nwill necessarily be made, as well as continued correction required\r\nfrom change and improvement in the methods of observation. It would\r\nbe impossible to give even a slight sketch of what has been done in\r\nthe two departments of nature referred to during the past few years.\r\nMineralogical and geological research have derived very great advantage\r\nfrom having been assigned to professional teaching. But, as Professor\r\nBonney reminds us, the progress made in geological work in particular,\r\nhas been directly due to the revelations of the microscope. It called\r\nforth an instrument of special construction for the purpose, the\r\npetrological microscope (Fig. 79), well equipped with Nicol’s prisms,\r\nand numerous other appliances demanded for the important investigations.\r\n\r\n“Upon the history of the two main groups of rocks the microscope has\r\nthrown much light. For the igneous rocks it has simplified their\r\nclassification and determined their mutual relations; while for the\r\nrudimentary group, it has shown the true nature of their constituents,\r\nand pointed out the sources from which they were derived. But it is in\r\nhelping to elucidate the problem of the metamorphic rocks, of which\r\nmuch less was known, that the microscope has been of the most service.\r\nIt has likewise greatly assisted in the attempt to determine the\r\nhistory and mutual relation of these rocks. One of the most important\r\nresults within the last few years has been the demonstration that\r\nwithout exception these crystallin schists are very old, all probably\r\nolder than the first rocks in which traces of life have been found. The\r\nconclusion arrived at, is that “the environment necessary for changing\r\nan ordinary sediment into a crystalline schist existed generally only\r\nin the earliest ages, and but very rarely and locally, if ever, since\r\npalæozoic time began.”\r\n\r\nThe crystalline schists then are the relics still preserved to us\r\nof the early days of the earth’s history, when the temperature near\r\nthe surface was still high. Since that time the zone for marked\r\nmineralogical changes has been continually sinking, until at the\r\npresent day it has reached a depth practically unattainable. “The\r\nsubterranean laboratory still exists, but the way to it was virtually\r\nclosed at a comparatively early period in the earth’s history.”\r\nGreater progress has been made since the microscope was pressed into\r\nthe service of geology, and inspires the hope that we shall yet learn\r\nsomething more of the earliest ages, when the mystery of life began.\r\n\r\n“It may be regarded as one of the most remarkable results of geological\r\nscience, that an acquaintance with organic forms is at least as\r\nnecessary for a geologist as a knowledge of minerals, and that a\r\ncorrect knowledge of organic remains (portions of fossil plants and\r\nanimals) should prove a more certain and unerring guide in unravelling\r\nthe structure of complicated districts of countries, than the most\r\nwide and general acquaintance with inorganic substances. The cause of\r\nthis, however, is obvious, as the mineral substances produced at any\r\none period of a vast succession of ages, do not appear to have had\r\nany essential difference from those formed under like circumstances\r\nat another. The animals and plants, however, living at one period of\r\nthe earth’s history were widely different from those living at other\r\nperiods. There has been a continuous succession of different races of\r\nliving beings on the earth following each other in a certain regular\r\nand ascertainable order, and when that order has been determined, it\r\nis equally certain that we can at once assign to its proper period of\r\nproduction, and therefore to its proper place in the series of rocks,\r\nany portion of earthy matter we may meet with containing any one, or\r\neven any recognisable fragment of one, of these once living beings.”\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing sections of minerals and rocks for microscopic\r\nexamination will be found at pp. 241, 307-309. The sections, it is\r\nalmost needless to say, must be prepared thin enough to permit the use\r\nof transmitted light, as well as for that of polarised light: that is\r\nto say, they should range from about 1/100th to 1/1000th of an inch.\r\nAlmost any lapidary will cut sections of any choice specimen.[88]\r\nThe formation of crystals, and the method of preparing them for\r\nexamination, has also been fully explained in the chapter on polarised\r\nlight, pp. 219 et seq., and illustrated on Plate VIII. It is well known\r\nin micro-chemistry that “almost every substance, simple or compound,\r\ncapable of existing in the solid state, assumes, under favourable\r\nconditions, a distinct geometrical figure, usually bounded by plane\r\nsurfaces and having angles of constant value.\r\n\r\nMuch useful information may be gained upon micro-crystallography, as\r\nwell as on almost everything having any relation to the _technique_ of\r\nthe microscope, in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society.” To\r\nthe June number (1898) Mr. T. Charters White contributes an article on\r\ncrystals, and reminds us that the presence of much or little moisture\r\nwill modify and alter forms, as much and as often as varying degrees of\r\ntemperature. At the same time he offers a few useful suggestions for\r\nthe purpose of securing better results, for which purpose he employs\r\nhippuric acid, hydroquinine, and picric acid alone or in combination\r\nwith hippuric acid, and an aqueous solution of bichromate of potassium,\r\ncrystallised in a tolerably thick emulsion of gum arabic. This is the\r\nonly aqueous solution; the other solvents have been methylated spirit,\r\nacetone, and absolute alcohol, taking these three solvents as types\r\nof the greatest volatility, because in making certain crystals it is\r\nnecessary that the solvent should evaporate quickly, otherwise the\r\ncrystals will assume their original forms. It is further desirable\r\nto make saturated, or even super-saturated solutions of the three\r\nchemicals named, as the colours produced under polarised light are\r\nof a deeper and richer character than they are if made from weaker\r\nsolutions. Of the three chemicals named he prefers hippuric acid, for\r\nreasons stated, that it is the most manageable, and allows of more time\r\nbeing taken in modifying the formation of the crystals. It is also\r\nadvisable to slightly warm the glass slide before the drop of fluid is\r\napplied. On the whole, picric acid appears to furnish a greater variety\r\nof crystals when used in combination with bichromate of potassium and a\r\nsolution of gum arabic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES AND TABLES USEFUL TO THE MICROSCOPIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nILLUMINATION ARRANGEMENTS OF THE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nA doubt has of late been expressed among practical microscopists\r\nas to the value of the illumination arrangements of the lamp and\r\nthe microscope, so as to secure the more perfect definition of the\r\nflagellate organ of the monas and other minute forms of infusorial\r\nlife. We have been told that better results will be obtained by\r\nturning the mirror aside, and so disposing the microscope and lamp\r\nin the horizontal position, that the central rays of light from the\r\nmirror-edge of the lamp-flame shall pass through the optical axis of\r\nthe achromatic condenser, the focus of which must be accurately brought\r\nupon the field of view by means of the substage centring screws and\r\nrack-work, and in such a manner, that by employing a 1-inch objective,\r\na sharply-defined image of the lamp-flame, edge-on, is projected on\r\nto the centre of the field in association with the specimen under\r\nexamination. If the 1-inch objective be now replaced by a 1-12th or\r\n1-16th inch immersion and once again focussed into place, and a slight\r\nre-adjustment of the centring made, it will be found that the field is\r\nbrilliantly illuminated, and the most minute portions of infusorial\r\nlife are well defined, and with a sharpness otherwise unattainable. At\r\nthe same time the graduating or iris diaphragm must be brought into use.\r\n\r\nDr. Clifford Mercer, the President of the American Microscopical\r\nSociety, who has quite recently reinvestigated the question of\r\nillumination, utterly condemns the narrow cone, as well as that of\r\noblique light in all such investigations, and considers the 3-4ths axil\r\ncone as the most suitable method for microscopical illumination, and\r\nhe bases his resolving limit accordingly. Some important experiments\r\nare brought forward by Dr. Mercer, which at the same time demonstrate\r\nthe correctness of Lord Rayleigh’s limit of resolution (referred to in\r\na previous chapter, p. 44), for circular apertures as contrasted with\r\nthat calculated by the late Sir George Airy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Abbé Theory, Dr. Mercer says: “Resolution in the\r\nAbbé Theory may be said to increase by bounds. So long as the central\r\nimage of the source of light alone is to be seen at the back of the\r\nobjective, resolution is not present. The aperture may be increased\r\nwithout change in the contraction of the diffraction pattern, and in\r\naccompanying resolution, so long as the central image alone is to\r\nbe seen at the back of the objective; but the moment the increase\r\nin aperture is sufficient to uncover or admit one flanking spectrum\r\nimage, resolution is present. With greater increase in aperture, no\r\nimprovement in the picture as to the contraction of the diffraction\r\npattern is to be seen until another spectrum image is uncovered or\r\nadmitted. Dr. Mercer gives his reasons for considering that the\r\nadvantageous reduction in a cone of light between an object and the\r\nobjective should not exceed, in the case of first-class objectives,\r\none-fourth to one-third (never more than one-half) of the diameter of\r\nthe cone. On the other hand, with full cone illumination, resolution\r\nincreases continuously, and not by jumps or by periodic accessions.\r\nWith regard to the use of oblique light, he says his Photos 2, 3, and\r\n4[89] are a pictorial warning for a second time against the use of\r\noblique illumination in ordinary work us a means of increasing, or of\r\nattempting to exhaust the resolving power of the microscope. At the\r\nsame time it becomes evident that every substage should be provided\r\nwith a means by which its condenser may be accurately centred, and that\r\nevery student using the microscope should be familiar with a method of\r\ncentring his substage condenser.\r\n\r\nDr. Mercer summarises the results of his experiments thus:--\r\n\r\n1. “Diffraction rays on leaving an object may be considered in the same\r\ncategory with other rays changed in direction by an object.\r\n\r\n2. “The diffraction phenomena seen in a projected image are essentially\r\nthe effect of changes in light _above_ the objective, due to a\r\nfunction of aperture, and not to changes _below_ the objective, due to\r\ndiffraction of light in the plane of the object.\r\n\r\n3. “Diffraction in the plane of the object does, under some\r\ncircumstances, furnish light to certain parts of an aperture from\r\nwhich primary rays are absent, and this enables aperture to more fully\r\ndetermine the character of the projected image, resulting in a more\r\nnearly truthful image, or, on the other hand, in false appearances.\r\nThis is the gist of the Abbé phenomena of microscopic vision.\r\n\r\n4. “But such phenomena are not peculiar to microscopic vision,\r\nnotwithstanding Professor Abbé’s claim to the contrary.\r\n\r\n5. “With any positive lens similar and more brilliant results may be\r\ngot by utilising corresponding pencils of primary rays, instead of\r\nisolated pencils of diffracted rays.\r\n\r\n6. “Still more trustworthy results may be got by using primary rays in\r\nplace of the isolated pencils of primary rays.\r\n\r\n7. “An advantage peculiar to using narrow cone illumination with\r\nan objective of wide aperture (the only illumination admissible in\r\nthe Abbé theory), consists in giving, under suitable conditions,\r\napproximately the acme of resolving power simultaneously in each\r\nseveral diameters. Thus a circular aperture is approximately squared\r\nor made rectangular as to resolving power in several of its diameters\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n8. “Special attention is called to the fact that the Abbé theory\r\ndeals with complex objects; for only such objects are subject to\r\nresolution. Single particles and uniform areas are outside its domain.\r\nThese latter, however, are microscopic objects, and all objects are\r\nessentially different shaped aggregations of points. An isolated\r\npoint-like particle, no matter what its minuteness, may be seen if it\r\npresent sufficient contrast with the surrounding microscopic field.\r\nThe size of the disc image is no less than a limit determined finally\r\nby aperture. That limit in size varying inversely with aperture,\r\ndetermines the limit of resolving power. This is the gist of the theory\r\nof microscopic vision which harmonises with our experimental study of\r\naperture.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nMICRO-PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nOwing in some measure to the more complete knowledge of the subject\r\ngained by the experience of years, and the extreme value of\r\nmicro-photography in the delineation of bacteria, and perhaps in a\r\nmeasure to the advent of the perfected dry-plate process, photography\r\nis being rapidly pressed forward in conjunction with the microscope. In\r\nthe course of the year [1898] no less than six, more or less, new forms\r\nof micro-photographic apparatus have appeared; two are simple, one\r\nfor daylight, one for lamp, one for electric, and one for lime-light\r\nillumination. Passing over the simpler forms, for a notice of which I\r\nam unable to find room, there is one piece of new apparatus, that of\r\nMr. E. B. Stringer, which is not only new, but is in every way adapted\r\nto the work of micro-photography. It is in fact a well-arranged camera,\r\nfitted with a powerful condensing arrangement, each portion of which\r\nis capable of being independently centred and controlled. Indeed, the\r\nspecially interesting feature of the apparatus is the control of the\r\ngas and the beautiful and uniformally illuminating disc of zircon,\r\nabout a quarter of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446.--Mr. E.

Dark slide.]\r\n\r\nThis efficient photo-micrographic apparatus (Fig. 446) is made by\r\nMessrs. W. Watson & Sons, under the instructions of Mr. E. B. Stringer.\r\nThe illuminating condensing system is mounted on a square brass bar,\r\nthe illuminant being oxygen-hydrogen light burning on zirconium.\r\nImmediately in front of this is a condenser, c, four and a half\r\ninches diameter, with an iris diaphragm, D, immediately in front of\r\nit. The holder, E, carries the light filtering media through which the\r\nbeam passes and enters the condenser, F. It then goes through a tank of\r\nwater contained in the cone, F to H, and emerges a practically parallel\r\nbeam of great intensity through a plano-concave lens, h, of such a\r\ndiameter as to exactly fill the back lens of the substage condenser.\r\nThere is an iris diaphragm, T, for cutting off stray light.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the apparatus is fitted with centring screws and clamps,\r\nand after having been once adjusted it is ready for use at any moment\r\nwithout preparation. By means of this apparatus, instantaneous pictures\r\ncan be taken of living rotifers, so brilliant is the illumination,\r\nwhile photographs of such fine objects as the flagella of bacteria\r\ncannot be secured with the same amount of certainty by any other\r\nmicrophotographic apparatus with which I have made myself acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nFORMULÆ AND METHODS:--CEMENTING, CLEARING, HARDENING AND MOUNTING.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARING AGENTS.\r\n\r\nThe object of employing a clearing agent is to replace the alcohol in\r\nthe dehydrated section by a liquid which has a refractive index about\r\nthe same as the balsam into which it is to be placed, and which will\r\nreadily mix with it.\r\n\r\nOIL OF BERGAMOT will clear quickly from 90 per cent. of alcohol.\r\nClove oil clears more rapidly, but it dissolves out aniline colours\r\nto a considerable extent. Xylol is without action on aniline colours.\r\nThis strength of alcohol is chosen because of its being that of the\r\nmethylated spirit sold in London, and which is much used in washing and\r\ndehydrating on account of its cheapness.\r\n\r\nOIL OF CEDAR WOOD, although an essential oil, resembles xylol, but\r\nevaporates slowly. It has very little solvent action on the aniline\r\ncolours. It clears rapidly from absolute alcohol, but not well from\r\n90 per cent. Sections can be left in it for several days. It is a\r\nconvenient medium in which to examine tissues before mounting them\r\npermanently. It clears celloidin without dissolving it; and as a\r\nconnecting fluid between the object and objective nothing better has\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nOther clearing agents have been tried, but as they dissolve out the\r\naniline colours, are no longer used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEMENTS.\r\n\r\nGROVE’S MASTIC AND BISMUTH.--Dissolve gum mastic in chloroform, and\r\nthicken with nitrate of bismuth. The solution of mastic should be\r\nnearly saturated.\r\n\r\nGROVE’S OXIDE OF ZINC, DAMMAR, AND DRYING OIL.--Rub up well-ground\r\noxide of zinc, 2 ozs., with drying oil, to the consistence of\r\nthick paint. Then add an equal quantity of gum dammar, previously\r\ndissolved in benzoline, and of the thickness of syrup. Strain through\r\nclose-meshed muslin. Keep in well-corked bottle, and, if necessary,\r\nthin with benzoline.\r\n\r\nISINGLASS CEMENT.--Heat the isinglass in a covered vessel on the\r\nwater-bath with a little glacial acetic acid, until it is thoroughly\r\nsoftened and forms a stiff mass, then gradually add more acid until it\r\nproduces a thick solution which is of uniform consistence, and just\r\nfluid while hot. Then run into wide-mouth bottles and close with good\r\ncorks.\r\n\r\nKITTON’S CEMENT of white lead and red lead in powder, and litharge\r\npowder in equal parts. Grind together with a little turpentine, until\r\nthoroughly incorporated, and mix with gold size. The mixture should be\r\nthin enough to use with a brush; in using, one coat should be allowed\r\nto dry before applying another. No more cement should be mixed with the\r\ngold size than is required for immediate use, as it sets quickly, and\r\nbecomes unworkable.\r\n\r\nKRÖNIG’S CEMENT.--Gradually add ordinary resin, 7 to 9 parts, to melted\r\nbeeswax, 2 parts, then steam and cool.\r\n\r\nSHELLAC CEMENT.--Dissolve shellac in an equal weight of methylated\r\nspirit, then pour off the clear portion and add a few drops of balsam\r\nand castor oil.\r\n\r\nMARINE GLUE.--Dissolve indiarubber in mineral naphtha, and add twice\r\nthe quantity of powdered shellac; or make chloroform the solvent,\r\nand use mastic instead of shellac. For casting battery trays, use a\r\ncomposition of 4 parts resin and 1 of gutta percha, with a little\r\nboiled oil.\r\n\r\nSELIER (_Cleaning Glass Slides_).--New slides or cover-glasses must be\r\nplaced for a few hours in a mixture of 1 part of potassium bichromate,\r\n1 of sulphuric acid, and 25 of water. Subsequently wash with water and\r\nwipe dry with a linen rag, after draining off the excess of moisture.\r\nCovers that have been used should be previously immersed for a few\r\ndays in a mixture of equal parts of alcohol and hydrochloric acid.\r\nScrape old slides free of mounting medium before immersing them in the\r\nbichromate solution.\r\n\r\nELSCHING’S CELLOIDIN SOLUTION.--Allow the celloidin shavings to swell\r\nup for 24 hours in the necessary quantity of absolute alcohol, then add\r\nthe proper amount of ether.\r\n\r\nKOCH’S COPAL.--Stain small pieces of material in bulk, and dehydrate\r\nwith alcohol, then immerse in a thin solution of copal in chloroform.\r\nEvaporate with a gentle heat until the solution is so far concentrated\r\nas to draw out into threads that are brittle on cooling. Then remove\r\nthe objects and leave on a tile for a few days to dry. Sections may\r\nthen be cut by means of a fine saw. If objects are imbedded unstained,\r\nremove copal from sections by soaking in chloroform, decalcify if\r\nnecessary, and stain.\r\n\r\nEULENSTEIN’S CEMENT.--Mix equal parts of Brunswick black and gold size\r\nwith a very little Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECALCIFYING AND BLEACHING.\r\n\r\nIn the case of bony structures, or tissues so impregnated with\r\ncalcium salts, the material should be decalcified by an acid capable\r\nof dissolving out the mineral matter. Hydrochloric acid with alcohol\r\nis in more general use. The older the bone the stronger will be the\r\nacid required, nitric with alcohol and chromic acid. Picric acid is\r\npreferred for fœtal bone.\r\n\r\nANDEER, J. J., finds an aqueous solution of phloroglucin acts as a\r\npowerful decalcifying agent on the bones of animals, but is without\r\naction on the most delicate organic tissue. If treatment with\r\nhydrochloric acid be employed as well, the residual “ossein” will be\r\nwithout a trace of either calcium phosphate or carbonate.\r\n\r\nEBNER’S FLUIDS.--(1) Mix 100 C.c. of cold saturated aqueous solution of\r\nsodium chloride, 100 C.c. of water, and 4 C.c. of hydrochloric acid.\r\nPreparations are placed in the fluid, and 1 to 2 C.c. of hydrochloric\r\nacid added daily until they are soft. (2) Mix 2·5 parts of hydrochloric\r\nacid (sp. gr. 1·16) with 500 of alcohol (90 per cent.), 100 of water,\r\nand 2·5 of sodium chloride.\r\n\r\nFOL’S LIQUID.--Mix 70 volumes of 1 per cent. chromic acid, 3 of nitric\r\nacid, and 200 of water.\r\n\r\nMAYER’S DESILIFICATION PROCESS.--Place the objects in alcohol\r\ncontained in a glass vessel coated internally with paraffin, then\r\nadd hydrofluoric acid drop by drop until desilification is complete,\r\navoiding the fumes meanwhile.\r\n\r\nMARSH’S CHLORINE METHOD.--Chlorine is generated in a small bottle by\r\ntreating crystals of potassium chlorate with strong HCl., and the gas\r\nis led through a piece of glass tubing, bent twice at right angles, to\r\nthe bottom of a bottle containing the sections immersed in water.\r\n\r\nRANVIER’S FLUID.--Use 50 per cent. hydrochloric acid with the addition\r\nof sodium chloride to counteract its swelling action.\r\n\r\nSQUIRE’S FLUID.--(1) Mix 95 parts of glycerine with 5 parts of\r\nhydrochloric acid; used for softening teeth. (2) Use a 4 per cent.\r\naqueous solution of arsenic acid at a temperature of 30° to 40° C.\r\nAfter softening tissues in this solution, keep them in alcohol.\r\n\r\nWALDEYER.--To a 0·1 per cent. solution of palladium chloride, add\r\none-tenth its volume of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDENING, FREEZING, AND EMBEDDING.\r\n\r\nALTMANN (_Fixing Solution_).--A mixture of equal parts of 5 per cent.\r\npotassium bichromate solution and 2 per cent. osmic acid.\r\n\r\nALCOHOL.--Strengths of alcoholic solutions, as given by Squire, will be\r\nfound of practical value. Absolute alcohol (sp. gr. O·797) containing\r\nabout 98 per cent. of ethylic alcohol is taken as the basis in most\r\ninstances. Alcohol of 90 per cent. (sp. gr. 0·823) is prepared by\r\nmixing 14 volumes of absolute alcohol and 1 volume of distilled water;\r\n84 per cent. alcohol (sp. gr. 0·838) is rectified spirit B.P.; 70\r\nper cent. alcohol (sp. gr. 0·872) may be obtained by adding 1 volume\r\nof distilled water to 3 volumes of absolute alcohol, 6 volumes of\r\nrectified spirit, or 4 volumes of methylated spirit; 50 per cent.\r\nalcohol (sp. gr. 0·918) is prepared by adding 4 volumes of distilled\r\nwater to 5 volumes of absolute alcohol, 3 volumes of water to 5 volumes\r\nof rectified spirit, or 3·5 volumes of water to 5 volumes of methylated\r\nspirit. Absolute alcohol, 75 C.c., mixed with acetic acid, 25 C.c.,\r\nserves as an excellent fixing agent for nuclei. Immerse tissues in\r\nit for 6 to 12 hours, then transfer to 90 per cent. alcohol until\r\nhardened, afterwards preserving in 70 per cent. alcohol till wanted.\r\n\r\nBETZ’S HARDENING FLUID.--A mixture of equal parts of sulphuric ether\r\nand alcohol. This is used for hardening the brain of insects prior to\r\ncutting sections.\r\n\r\nCOLE’S FREEZING PROCESS.--Dissolve picked gum acacia, 4 ozs., in\r\ndistilled water, 6 ozs., and to each 5 parts of the resulting\r\nmucilage add 3 parts of syrup made by dissolving loaf sugar, 1 lb.,\r\nin distilled water, 1 pint. To each ounce of the medium add 5 grains\r\nof pure carbolic acid, and soak the tissues in it prior to freezing.\r\nFor tissues liable to come to pieces, mix 4 parts of syrup with 5 of\r\nmucilage.\r\n\r\nFLEMMING’S FIXING SOLUTION.--Osmic acid (1 per cent. solution), 80\r\nC.c.; chromic acid (10 per cent. solution), 15 C.c.; glacial acetic\r\nacid, 10 C.c.; distilled water, 95 C.c.\r\n\r\nFOL’S FIXING--Osmic acid (1 per cent. solution), 4 C.c.; chromic\r\nacid (10 per cent. solution), 5 C.c.; glacial acetic acid, 10 C.c.;\r\ndistilled water, 181 C.c.\r\n\r\nFISCHER’S IMBEDDING MASS.--Dissolve 15 parts of transparent soap in\r\n17·5 parts of 96 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nKLEIN’S HARDENING.--Mix 1 C.c. of 10 per cent. chromic acid solution\r\nwith 60 C.c. of water, and add 30 C.c. of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nMÜLLER’S FLUID FORMULA, see page 288.--This solution is sometimes mixed\r\nwith one-third its volume of 90 per cent. alcohol, its hardening action\r\nbeing then much more rapid.\r\n\r\nRABL’S HARDENING FLUID.--Chromic acid solution (10 per cent.), 7 C.c.;\r\nwater, 200 C.c.; formic acid (sp. gr. 1·2), 5 drops.\r\n\r\nROLLETT’S FREEZING PROCESS.--Small portions of tissue placed on the\r\nstage of microtome, after immersion in the white of an egg, then frozen\r\nand cut with a very cold knife.\r\n\r\nRYDER (_Double Embedding_).--After the celloidin bath, soak objects\r\nin chloroform, then remove into a mixture of chloroform and paraffin,\r\nheated to not more than 40° C., and finally into a bath of pure\r\nparaffin.\r\n\r\nSTRICKER (_Imbedding Mass_).--Prepare the objects in alcohol and imbed\r\nin a concentrated solution in gum arabic in a paper case, then throw\r\nthe whole into alcohol and cut after 2 or 3 days.\r\n\r\nWEBB (_Dextrin Freezing_).--A thick solution of dextrin (1:40)\r\nin aqueous solution of carbolic acid is used for imbedding, and\r\nsubsequently frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTING MEDIA.\r\n\r\nSections are usually mounted in balsam, dammar, glycerine, &c., but it\r\nis not a necessity that the cover-glass should be fixed or cemented\r\ndown. Some cements (caoutchouc by preference) should be employed when\r\nglycerine or aqueous (Farrant’s) media are used.\r\n\r\nALLEGER’S GELATINE PROCESS.--Add a few drops of formalin to each gramme\r\nof 0·5 to 1 per cent. gelatine solution. After mounting the section in\r\nthis, apply heat to the slide until the paraffin is softened, and allow\r\nthe superfluous gelatine to drain from the edge of the slide.\r\n\r\nAPÁTHY’S MOUNTING MEDIUM.--Picked gum arabic, 50 Gm.; cane-sugar, 50\r\nGm.; distilled water, 50 Gm.; dissolve over a warm bath and add 0·05\r\nGm. of thymol. This medium sets very hard, and combined with a paper\r\ncell it may be used for ringing glycerine mounts.\r\n\r\nCOLE’S SLOW OR EXPOSURE METHOD OF MOUNTING.--Dissolve dried Canada\r\nbalsam, 3 ozs., in benzole, 3 fl. ozs., and filter. Apply a clean\r\ncover-glass to a slide that has been moistened by breathing on it,\r\nand place a few drops of the balsam solution on the cover-glass. Then\r\nremove a section from turpentine, and put it into the balsam. Put\r\naside for 12 hours to allow the benzole to evaporate, and having\r\nwarmed a slide and added a drop of fresh balsam solution to that on the\r\ncover-glass, bring the fluid balsam in contact with the warmed slide.\r\nPress the cover down carefully to avoid the inclusion of air bubbles,\r\nand when the excess of balsam is squeezed out, put the slide aside to\r\ncool, after which it may be cleaned with a camel-hair brush or soft rag\r\nmoistened with methylated spirit.\r\n\r\nFARRANT’S SOLUTION.--Take of gum arabic 5 parts; water 5 parts; when\r\nthe gum is fairly dissolved add 10 parts of a 5 per cent. solution of\r\ncarbolic acid.\r\n\r\nFLEMMING’S GLYCERINE PRESERVATIVE.--Mix equal parts of alcohol,\r\nglycerine, and water.

After cutting sections from\r\nmaterial thus prepared they must be well washed with water.\r\n\r\nGRAM’S STAIN FOR BACTERIA.--This is prepared by shaking 15 drops of\r\naniline oil with 15 Gm. of water, filtering the solution and adding to\r\nthe filtrate 4 to 5 drops of saturated alcoholic solution of gentian\r\nviolet. Or shake 3·3 C.c. of aniline with 100 C.c. of distilled water\r\nand, after filtering, add 11 C.c. of concentrated alcoholic solution of\r\ngentian violet and 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol. After preparations have\r\nbeen stained for 1 to 3 minutes in one of the above they are quickly\r\nrinsed in absolute alcohol and then placed in Gram’s solution of iodine\r\nin potassium iodine (iodine, 1 Gm.; potassium iodine, 2 Gm.; water, 300\r\nC.c.), until they have acquired a brown colour. This takes about 1 to\r\n3 minutes, and they are next washed in 90 per cent. alcohol until they\r\nbecome pale yellow, then dehydrated, cleared, and mounted in balsam.\r\nCounterstain with eosine or vesuvine if desired.\r\n\r\nGRAM’S SOLUTION.--Iodine, 1 Gm.; potassium iodine, 2 Gm.; distilled\r\nwater, 300 Gm.\r\n\r\nGRENACHER’S ALUM CARMINE.--Dissolve 5 Gm. of ammonium alum in 100 C.c.\r\nof distilled water, add 1 Gm. of carmine, and boil for 20 minutes,\r\nfilter when cool, and add distilled water to make up to 100 C.c.\r\n\r\nGRENACHER’S ALCOHOLIC BORAX CARMINE.--Dissolve 4 Gm. of borax in 100\r\nC.c. of distilled water, then add 3 Gm. of carmine, and heat gently.\r\nFinally, add 100 C.c. of 70 per cent. alcohol, filter the solution, if\r\nnecessary, before use. Pieces of tissues are stained in this for 1 to 3\r\ndays, and then transferred to 70 per cent. alcohol, containing 0·5 to 1\r\nper cent. of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nHEIDENHAIN’S HÆMATOXYLIN METHOD.--Dissolve (_a_) hæmatoxylin, 1 Gm.,\r\nin distilled water, 300 C.c.; (_b_) potassium chromate, 1 Gm., in\r\ndistilled water, 200 C.c. Small pieces of tissue hardened in alcohol\r\nor picric acid are placed in (_a_) for 12 to 24 hours, and then\r\ntransferred for a similar length of time to (_b_). Wash thoroughly in\r\nwater, dehydrate in alcohol, and imbed in paraffin.\r\n\r\nHENLE’S STAIN (_for nervous tissue_).--Sections are left in palladium\r\nchloride solution (1:300 to 1:600) till they are of a straw colour,\r\nthen rinsed in water and stained with strong ammonia carmine.\r\n\r\nHENNEGUY’S ALUM CARMINE.--Excess of carmine is boiled in saturated\r\nsolution of potash alum, and 10 per cent. of glacial acetic acid added\r\non cooling. Allow to settle for some days, and then filter.\r\n\r\nHENNEGUY’S PERMANGANATE METHOD.--Treat sections for 5 minutes with 1\r\nper cent. potassium permanganate solution, then wash in water and stain\r\nwith safranine, rubin, gentian violet, vesuvine, preference being given\r\nto a safranine solution prepared with aniline water.\r\n\r\nHERMANN’S PLATINO-ACETO-OSMIC MIXTURE.--Mix 15 parts of 1 per cent.\r\nplatinic chloride solution, 1 part of glacial acetic acid, and 2 or 4\r\nparts of 2 per cent. osmic acid.\r\n\r\nHERTWIG’S MACERATING FLUID.--Mix equal parts of 0·05 per cent. osmic\r\nacid, and 0·2 per cent. acetic acid. Medusæ are treated with this\r\nmixture for 2 or 3 minutes, then washed in 0·1 per cent. acetic acid\r\nuntil free from osmic acid. Leave them for 24 hours in the dilute\r\nacetic acid, then wash in water, stain with Beale’s carmine, and mount\r\nin glycerine. For Actiniæ use 0·04 per cent. osmic acid and make both\r\nsolutions with sea water. Wash out with 0·2 per cent. acetic acid, and\r\nstain with picro-carmine.\r\n\r\nHESSERT’S METHOD FOR STAINING FLAGELLA.--Fix the film by treating\r\ncover-glass preparations with a saturated alcoholic solution of\r\nmercuric chloride, wash, and stain for 30 or 40 minutes in a hot 10 per\r\ncent. aqueous solution of saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsine.\r\n\r\nHOFFMANN’S BLUE STAIN.--Dissolve 1 Gm. of Hoffmann’s blue in 20 C.c.\r\nof rectified spirit and 80 C.c. of distilled water, then add 0·5\r\nC.c. of glacial acetic acid. As a nuclear stain immerse sections for\r\n10 minutes or more, rinse in water, wash in 90 per cent. alcohol,\r\ndehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam. To stain sieve areas, less time\r\nis required, 5 to 10 minutes, rinse in distilled water, and mount in\r\nglycerine; or dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nHOYER’S SHELLAC INJECTION MASS.--Dissolve shellac in 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol to the consistency of a thin syrup, and strain through muslin\r\nof medium thickness. Colour with aniline colours in alcoholic solution,\r\nor by means of vermilion or other pigment suspended in alcohol.\r\n\r\nHOYER’S SILVER NITRATE GELATINE MASS.--Mix a concentrated solution of\r\ngelatine with an equal volume of a 4 per cent. silver nitrate solution\r\nand warm, then add a very small quantity of aqueous pyrogallic acid\r\nsolution to reduce the silver salt, and add chloral and glycerine as in\r\nthe carmine gelatine mass.\r\n\r\nHOYER’S SILVER STAIN.--Add ammonia to a solution of silver nitrate of\r\nknown strength, until the precipitate formed just re-dissolves, then\r\ndilute the solution until it contains 0·75 to 0·50 per cent. of the\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nKAISER’S BISMARCK BROWN STAIN. Sections are stained for 48 hours, at a\r\ntemperature of 60 C., in a saturated solution of Bismarck brown in 60\r\nper cent. alcohol, and washed out in 60 per cent. alcohol containing 2\r\nper cent. of H.C.L., or 3 per cent. of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nKAISER’S NERVE STAIN.--This is a modification of Weigert’s process.\r\nThe material is hardened in Müller’s solution for 2 or 3 days, then\r\ncut into slices 2 to 4 Mm. thick, and treated with the solution for 5\r\nor 6 days more. Subsequently immerse in Marchi’s solution for 8 days,\r\nthen wash, pass through alcohol, and imbed in celloidin. Sections are\r\nmordanted for 5 minutes in the following mixture:--Solutions of ferric\r\nchloride, 1 part; distilled water, 1 part; rectified spirit, 8 parts.\r\nNext wash in Weigert’s hæmatoxylin, and warm in a fresh quantity of\r\nthe same for a few minutes, wash with water, differentiate in Pal’s\r\nsolution, and neutralise the oxalic acid by washing in water containing\r\na little ammonia.\r\n\r\nKAISER’S STAIN FOR THE SPINAL CORD.--Sections are stained for a few\r\nhours in solution of náphthylamine brown, 1 part, in water, 200 parts,\r\nand alcohol, 100 parts. Afterwards wash with alcohol and clear with\r\noriganum oil.\r\n\r\nKALLIN’S NEUROLOGICAL METHOD.--Dissolve hydroquinone, 5 Gm., sodium\r\nsulphite, 40 Gm., and potassium carbonate, 75 Gm., in 25 Gm. of\r\ndistilled water. At the time of using, dilute this solution with\r\none-third to one-half its bulk of absolute alcohol; immerse sections\r\nof silvered material for several minutes until reduction is complete.\r\nThen place them in 70 per cent. alcohol for 10 to 15 minutes, and\r\nsubsequently leave in aqueous solution of sodium hyposulphite (1:5) for\r\n24 hours or more. Finally dehydrate and mount. Carmine may be used as\r\nan afterstain.\r\n\r\nKLEINENBERG’S SOLUTION (_Improved Formula_).--Hæmatoxylin, 2-1/2 Gm.;\r\ncrystallised calcium chloride, 20 Gm. in 10 C.c. of distilled water;\r\nalum, 3 Gm. in 16 C.c. of distilled water; rectified spirit, 240 C.c.\r\nDissolve the calcium chloride and alum in their respective quantities\r\nof water by the aid of heat; mix the solutions and immediately dilute\r\nwith rectified spirit; after an hour filter and add the hæmatoxylin.\r\nThis makes a good working solution which keeps well. Of course it\r\ncontains the alumina in solution, not as alum but aluminium chloride.\r\nIf in special cases the colour is considered too strong, the dilution\r\n(when staining in bulk) must be made with some of the solution to which\r\nhæmatoxylin has not been added.\r\n\r\nKOCH’S METHOD FOR STAINING FLAGELLA.--Immerse cover-glass preparations\r\nin a 1 per cent. aqueous solution of hæmatoxylin, then transfer to a 5\r\nper cent. solution of chromic acid or to Müller’s fluid; dry and mount\r\nin balsam.\r\n\r\nKOCH-EHRLICH, BACILLI.--Place sections, or cover-glass preparations,\r\nfor at least 12 hours in gentian violet, or fuchsine aniline water\r\n(aniline water, 100 C.c.; concentrated alcoholic solution of gentian\r\nviolet, or fuchsine, 11 C.c.; absolute alcohol, 10 C.c.), then immerse\r\nin a mixture of pure nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·42), 10 C.c., and distilled\r\nwater, 30 C.c., for some seconds. Rinse in 60 per cent. alcohol for a\r\nfew minutes, and then counterstain with vesuvine (vesuvine, 0·5 Gm.;\r\nrectified spirit, 20 C.c.; distilled water, 80 C.c.) after gentian\r\nviolet; or methylene blue (methylene blue, 0·25 Gm.; rectified spirit,\r\n20 C.c.; distilled water, 80 C.c.) after fuchsine. Finally rinse in\r\nwater, dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam. According to Squire, who\r\npoints out that nitric acid is apt to injure delicate sections, Watson\r\nCheyne recommends that sections should be transferred from fuchsine\r\naniline water to distilled water, then rinsed in alcohol, and placed\r\nin the following contrast stain for 1 or 2 hours:--Saturated alcoholic\r\nsolution of methylene blue, 20 C.c.; distilled water, 100 C.c.; formic\r\nacid (sp. gr. 1·2), 1 C.c.\r\n\r\nKÜHNE’S CARBOLIC METHYLENE BLUE.--Rub up 1·5 Gm. of methylene blue with\r\n10 C.c. of absolute alcohol, and add 100 C.c. of a 5 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nKÜHNE’S METHYL VIOLET SOLUTION.--Dissolve 1 Gm. of methyl violet in 90\r\nC.c. of distilled water and 100 C.c. of alcohol.\r\n\r\nKÜHNE’S ANILINE OIL SOLUTIONS.--Rub up as much methylene blue, methyl\r\ngreen, or safranine as will go upon the point of a knife, with 10 C.c.\r\nof aniline, and allow to settle.\r\n\r\nKÜHNE’S CARBOLIC FUCHSINE OR BLACK BROWN.--Dissolve 1 Gm. of fuchsine\r\nor black brown in 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol, and add 100 C.c. of a 5\r\nper cent. aqueous solution of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nKÜHNE’S MODIFICATION OF GRAM’S METHOD.--Stain nuclei with carmine,\r\nthen treat sections for 5 minutes in methyl violet solution, diluted\r\none-sixth with a 1 per cent. aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate,\r\nor in a solution of Victoria blue, 0·25 Gm., in rectified spirit, 20\r\nC.c., and distilled water, 80 C.c. Next rinse thoroughly in water and\r\ntransfer to Grain’s solution for 2 to 3 minutes; again rinse in water\r\nand extract excess of stain with solution of yellow fluorescine, 1\r\nGm., in absolute alcohol, 50 C.c. Finally, pass through pure alcohol,\r\naniline, terebene, and xylol, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nLÖFFLER’S SOLUTION.--Concentrated alcoholic solution of methylene blue,\r\n30 C.c.; solution of (caustic potash) potassium hydrate (1:10,000), 100\r\nC.c. Mix and filter shortly before use. Sections are stained for a few\r\nminutes (tubercle sections for some hours), and excess of stain can be\r\nremoved by immersion for a few seconds in 0·5 per cent. acetic acid.\r\nDehydrate in absolute alcohol, clear in cedar oil, and mount in balsam.\r\nLöffler found that most bacteria stained better in this solution than\r\nin the weaker solutions used by Koch for turbercle bacillus.\r\n\r\nLAVDOWSKY’S BILBERRY JUICE STAIN.--Well wash the fresh berries of\r\n_Vaccinium myrtillus_, then express the juice and mix with twice its\r\nbulk of distilled water, mixed with a little 90 per cent. alcohol. Heat\r\nfor a short time and filter whilst warm. Dilute the stain with 2 or 3\r\nvolumes of distilled water before use.\r\n\r\nLEE’S FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTIONS.--(1) Mix 1 part of 40 per cent.\r\nformaldehyde solution with two parts of 1 per cent. chromic acid\r\nsolution, and add 4 per cent. of acetic acid. (2) Mix 1 part of 40\r\nper cent. formaldehyde solution with 4 parts of 1 per cent. platinic\r\nchloride solution, and add 2 per cent. of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nLEE’S OSMIC ACID AND PYROGALLOL STAIN.--Fix the tissues in Hermann’s\r\nmixture or Flemming’s mixture for half an hour, then place in a weak\r\nsolution of pyrogallol, which may be prepared with alcohol in some\r\ncases. Safranine may be used as a second stain.\r\n\r\nMARTINOTTI’S PICRO-NIGROSINE STAIN.--Pathological objects are stained\r\nfor 2 or 3 hours or days, in a saturated solution of nigrosine in\r\nsaturated alcoholic picric acid solution. Then wash out in a mixture\r\nof 1 part of formic acid with 2 parts of alcohol until the grey matter\r\nappears clearly differentiated from the white to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nMAYER’S ALUMINIUM CHLORIDE CARMINE.--Dissolve 1 Gm. of carminic acid\r\nand 3 Gm. of aluminium chloride in 200 C.c. of water.\r\n\r\nMAYER’S BERLIN BLUE INJECTION.--Add a solution of 10 C.c. of tincture\r\nof ferric chloride in 500 C.c. of water, to a solution of 20 Gm. of\r\npotassium ferrocyanide in 500 C.c. of water, allow to stand for 12\r\nhours, decant, wash the deposit for 1 or 2 days with distilled water\r\nuntil the washings come through dark blue, then dissolve the blue in\r\nabout a litre of water.\r\n\r\nMAYER’S CARMALUM.--Dissolve 1 Gm. of carminic acid and 10 Gm. of alum\r\nin 200 C.c. of distilled water; decant, or filter, and add a few\r\ncrystals of thymol, 0·1 per cent. of salicylic acid, or 0·5 per cent.\r\nof sodium salicylate. A weaker solution contains 3 to 5 times as much\r\nalum and 5 times as much water.\r\n\r\nMERBEL’S CARMINE AND INDIGO FLUIDS (give a blue and red stain, and\r\nare very selective).--To prepare the red fluid, take--Carmine, 2 dr.;\r\nborax, 2 dr.; distilled water, 4 ozs. For the blue fluid, take--Indigo\r\ncarmine, 2 dr.; borax, 2 dr.; distilled water, 4 ozs. Mix each in a\r\nmortar, and allow it to stand, then pour off the supernatant fluid.\r\nIf the sections have been hardened in chromic acid, picric acid, or a\r\nbichromate, they must be washed in water till no tinge appears. Place\r\nthem in alcohol for fifteen or twenty minutes, then in the two fluids\r\nmixed in equal proportions, after which wash them in a saturated\r\naqueous solution of oxalic acid, where they should remain a rather\r\nshorter time than in the staining fluids. When sufficiently bleached,\r\nwash them in water, to get rid of the acid, then pass them through\r\nspirit and oil of cloves, and mount in balsam or dammar.\r\n\r\nMITROPHANOW’S GOLD PROCESS FOR PRICKLE-CELLS AND INTERCELLULAR\r\nCANALS.--Wash the tail of an axolotl larva with distilled water, place\r\nfor an hour in a watch-glassful of 0·25 per cent. solution of gold\r\nchloride, containing 1 drop of hydrochloric acid; wash, and reduce in a\r\nmixture of 1 part of formic acid with 6 parts of water.\r\n\r\nMITROPHANOW’S MACERATION METHOD FOR EPITHELIUM.--Fix the embryo for 15\r\nminutes in 3 per cent. nitric acid; then place for an hour in a mixture\r\nof alcohol, 1 volume, and water 2 volumes, and finally treat with\r\nstronger alcohol for 24 hours to separate the epidermis.\r\n\r\nMÜLLER’S BERLIN BLUE FOR INJECTIONS.--Precipitate a concentrated\r\nsolution of Berlin blue by means of 90 per cent. alcohol. The\r\nprecipitate is very finely divided, whilst the fluid is perfectly\r\nneutral and much easier to prepare than that of Beale.\r\n\r\nNEILSEN’S SOLUTION OF METHYL VIOLET.--Dissolve fuchsine, 1 part, in\r\nalcohol, 10 parts, and add a 5 per cent. watery solution of carbolic\r\nacid, 100 parts.\r\n\r\nNEISSER’S DOUBLE-STAINING FOR SPORE-BEARING BACILLI.--Cover-glass\r\npreparations are immersed for 20 minutes in fuchsine aniline water\r\n(concentrated alcoholic solution of fuchsine, 11 C.c.; absolute\r\nalcohol, 10 C.c.; aniline water, 100 C.c.; then heat to 80° or 90° C.;\r\nnext rinse in water, alcohol, or weak acid, according to the nature\r\nof the bacilli, counterstain with aqueous solution of methylene blue,\r\nrinse in water, dry and mount in balsam). The spores are stained red\r\nand the rest of the bacilli blue.\r\n\r\nNISSL’S FUCHSINE STAIN FOR NERVE CELLS.--(1) Fresh material in pieces\r\nmeasuring 1 C.c. are hardened in a “chromic solution in 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol” for 2 days, then transferred to absolute alcohol for 5 days,\r\nand afterwards cut. Stain the sections singly in a saturated solution\r\nof fuchsine, warming in a deep watch-glass until vapours begin to be\r\ngiven off. Next plunge the section into absolute alcohol for 1 or 2\r\nminutes, then place it on a slide, flood with clove oil, and when no\r\nmore colour is given off, drain and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nOHLMACHER’S FORMALDEHYDE STAINING.--Formalin in a 2 to 4 per cent.\r\nsolution is used as a mordant for tar colours. The tissues may be\r\nmordanted separately by treatment for 1 minute or longer, or the\r\nformalin may be added to the stain. Dissolve 1 Gm. of fuchsine in 10\r\nC.c. of absolute alcohol, and add to 100 C.c. of 4 per cent. formalin\r\nsolution. Or, add saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet or\r\nmethyl violet 5 B. to the formalin solution, in the proportion of 1:10.\r\nIn the case of methylene blue, dissolve 1 G.m. in 100 C.c. of the\r\nformalin solution. Sections stain in half a minute, and are said to\r\nresist alcohol much more than if formalin were not used.\r\n\r\nOPPITZ’S SILVER STAINING.--Reduction is very rapidly effected by\r\nplacing the preparations for 2 or 3 minutes in a 0·25 to 0·5 per cent.\r\nsolution of chloride of tin.\r\n\r\nPAL’S HÆMATOXYLIN STAIN.--Dissolve 0·75 Gm. of hæmatoxylin in 90 C.c.\r\nof distilled water and 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol. Just before use add\r\nsaturated solution of lithium carbonate in the proportion of 3 drops to\r\neach 10 C.c. of hæmatoxylin solution. (See Weigert.)\r\n\r\nPAL’S HÆMATOXYLIN METHOD.--Proceed at first as in Weigert’s process for\r\nnerve fibre, omitting the copper bath, and stain in Pal’s hæmatoxylin\r\nsolution (see above) for 5 or 6 hours. Then wash the sections in\r\ndistilled water (containing a trace of lithium carbonate if the\r\nsections are not deep blue), next treat for 15 to 30 seconds with\r\na 0·25 per cent. potassium permanganate solution, rinse in water,\r\nand decolourise in Pal’s bleaching solution. (If black spots appear\r\nreplace in the permanganate solution, again bleach, and wash for 15\r\nminutes in water.) The grey substance of the sections is decolourised\r\nin a few sections; the sections should then be well washed out, and\r\nmay be double-stained with picro-carmine or acetic acid carmine (see\r\nSchneider), Magdala red, or eosine. The nuclei may be stained with alum\r\ncarmine. Finally dehydrate, clear, and mount.\r\n\r\nPAL-EXNER’S OSMIC ACID METHOD.--Spinal cord or brain in 0·25 inch\r\ncubes is immersed in 0·5 per cent. osmic acid solution for 2 days,\r\nthe solution being changed each day; then wash in water, transfer to\r\nabsolute alcohol, and imbed in celloidin or paraffin. Place sections as\r\ncut in glycerine, then wash in water, treat with potassium permanganate\r\nand Pal’s solution, as in Pal’s hæmatoxylin method, counter-stain with\r\ncarmine, dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nPLANT’S METHOD OF STAINING ACTINOMYCOSIS.--Sections are placed for 10\r\nminutes in Gibbes’ magenta solution or carbolic fuchsine, at 45° C.;\r\nnext they are rinsed in water and placed in saturated aqueous solution\r\nof picric acid, mixed with an equal volume of absolute alcohol, for 5\r\nor 10 minutes; they are then washed once more, passed through 50 per\r\ncent. alcohol into absolute alcohol, cleared in cedar oil, and mounted\r\nin balsam.\r\n\r\nRANVIER’S LEMON JUICE METHOD.--Soak pieces of fresh tissue in fresh\r\nlemon juice until transparent (5 to 10 minutes), then rapidly wash\r\nin distilled water, treat for 10 to 60 minutes with 1 per cent.\r\ngold chloride solution, again wash and expose to light in a bottle\r\ncontaining 50 C.c. of distilled water and 2 drops of acetic acid.\r\nReduction is complete in 24 to 48 hours. If it is not desired to retain\r\nthe superficial epithelium, reduction may be more completely effected\r\nin the dark, by treatment with formic acid (sp. gr. 1·2), diluted with\r\n3 times its volume of water. The lemon juice in the above process may\r\nbe replaced by an aqueous solution of citric acid (40 grains in each\r\nounce).\r\n\r\nRANVIER’S PICRO-CARMINE.--Carmine, 1 part; distilled water, 10 parts;\r\nsolution of ammonia, 3 parts; mix and add of a cold saturated solution\r\nof picric acid 200 parts.\r\n\r\nRENAUT’S HÆMATOXYLIC EOSINE.--Mix 30 C.c. of concentrated aqueous\r\nsolution of eosine, 40 C.c. of saturated alcoholic solution of\r\nhæmatoxylin (which has been kept for some time and precipitated),\r\nand 130 C.c. of saturated solution of potash alum in glycerine (sp.\r\ngr. 1·26). Stand for 5 or 6 weeks in a partially covered vessel,\r\nprotected from dust, until the alcohol is evaporated, and then filter.\r\nThe filtrate can be diluted with glycerine if desired. Mount objects\r\nin this fluid diluted with 1 or 2 volumes of glycerine, or, stain\r\nseparately for some days or weeks and mount in balsam, after washing in\r\nalcohol charged with a sufficient quantity of eosine.\r\n\r\nRANVIER AND VIGNAL’S OSMIUM MIXTURE.--Fix tissues in a freshly-prepared\r\nmixture of equal volumes of 1 per cent. osmic acid and 90 per cent.\r\nalcohol, then wash out in 80 per cent. alcohol, next with water, and\r\nstain for 48 hours with picro-carmine or hæmatoxylin. This method has\r\nbeen applied to the histology of insects.\r\n\r\nRENAUT’S GLYCERINE HÆMATOXYLIN.--To a saturated solution of potash alum\r\nin glycerine, add a saturated solution of homatoxylin in 90 per cent.\r\nalcohol drop by drop, so as to form a deeply coloured solution. Expose\r\nto daylight for a week, and then filter. This solution, like Renaut’s\r\nhæmatoxylic cosine, may be used for mounting unstained sections, which\r\nafter some time absorb the colour from the liquid and become stained.\r\n\r\nSAFRANINE.--Safranine, 0·5 Gm.; rectified spirit, 20 C.c.; distilled\r\nwater, 80 C.c.\r\n\r\nSCHÄFER’S ACID LOGWOOD SOLUTION is especially useful for certain\r\nstructures, as tendon, cells, &c. It is thus prepared:--A 1 per cent.\r\nsolution of acetic acid is coloured by the addition of 1·3 of its\r\nvolume of logwood solution.\r\n\r\nSCHÄFER’S ANILINE DYES, whether in aqueous or alcoholic solutions,\r\ngive good results, and are prepared as follows:--Roseanilin or magenta\r\n(1 gr. to 1 oz. of alcohol), red; acetate of mauvein (4 gr., alcohol\r\n1 oz., acid nitric 2 drops), blue; aniline black (2 gr., water 1\r\noz.), grey-black; Nicholson’s soluble blue (1-6 gr., alcohol 1 oz.,\r\nand nitric 2 m.), blue. These stains should be used weak; and after\r\nsections are stained they should be passed through alcohol and oil of\r\ncloves as rapidly as possible; otherwise the colour will dissolve out\r\nbefore they can be mounted in balsam.\r\n\r\nSCHULTZE (_Staining Bacilli_).--Stain sections and cover-glass\r\npreparations for some hours in aqueous methylene blue solution,\r\ndifferentiate in 0·5 per cent. acetic acid, dehydrate in alcohol, clear\r\nin cedar oil, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nSCLAVO’S STAIN FOR FLAGELLA.--Leave the preparations for 1 minute in\r\na solution of 1 Gm. of tannin in 100 C.c. of 50 per cent. alcohol;\r\nwash in distilled water; transfer for 1 minute to 50 per cent.\r\nphospho-molybdic acid; again wash, and stain for 3 to 5 minutes in\r\na hot saturated solution of fuchsine in aniline water. Then wash in\r\nwater, dry on filter paper, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nSQUIRE’S PICRO-CARMINE.--(1) Dissolve 1 Gm. of carmine with a gentle\r\nheat in 3 C.c. of strong solution of ammonia, and 5 C.c. of distilled\r\nwater, then add 200 C.c. of saturated aqueous solution of picric\r\nacid, heat to boiling, and filter. (2) Dissolve 10 Gm. of carmine in\r\na solution of 1 Gm. of caustic soda in 1000 C.c. of distilled water;\r\nboil, filter and make up to 1000 C.c. with water. Mix the solution with\r\nan equal quantity of water, and add 1 per cent. aqueous solution of\r\npicric acid so long as the turbidity produced disappears on agitation.\r\n\r\nSQUIRE’S BLUEING OF SECTIONS.--After staining with hæmatoxylin, treat\r\nfor a few seconds with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (1:1000) in\r\ndistilled water.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE (_Fuchsine_).--Ether shaken with a solution containing\r\nfuchsine is coloured violet after adding ferrous iodide, but not before.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA BLUE.--Victoria blue, 0·25 Gm.; rectified spirit, 20 C.c.;\r\ndistilled water, 80 C.c.\r\n\r\nWEDL’S ORSEILLE OR ORCHELLA STAIN.--Mix 5 C.c. of acetic acid, 20\r\nC.c. of absolute alcohol, and 40 C.c. of distilled water; then add\r\nsufficient archil, from which excess of ammonia has been driven off, to\r\nform a dark reddish fluid.\r\n\r\nWEIGERT’S HÆMATOXYLIN.--Dissolve 1 part of hæmatoxylin in 10 parts of\r\nabsolute alcohol; then add 90 parts of distilled water and 1 part of\r\naqueous solution (1:70) of lithium carbonate.\r\n\r\nWEIGERT (_Gram’s Method_).--In this modification aniline is substituted\r\nfor alcohol, in order to avoid prolonged washing with the latter, and\r\nthe process is conducted on a slide. The section is placed on a slide,\r\nstained with a few drops of gentian violet aniline water, prepared\r\nas in Gram’s method, the excess of fluid removed, and a few drops of\r\nGram’s solution applied. Subsequently remove the liquid by gently\r\nblotting it off, then wash the section by allowing aniline to flow’\r\nbackwards and forwards over it, and when colour ceases to come away,\r\nrepeat the operation with xylol for about 1 minute, then mount in\r\nbalsam.\r\n\r\nWEIGERT (_Staining in Actinomycosis_).--Immerse sections for 1 hour in\r\nWedl’s Orseille stain, then quickly rinse with alcohol and counterstain\r\nwith gentian violet. If it be desired to stain the mycelium also,\r\nafterwards submit the sections to Weigert’s modification of Gram’s\r\nmethod. See page 335.\r\n\r\nWEIGERT (_Staining Brain Tissue_).--Pieces of brain and spinal cord are\r\nhardened in bichromate solution, followed by alcohol, then imbedded in\r\ncelloidin or gum. If imbedded in celloidin, the pieces are subsequently\r\ntaken from the spirit in which they are immersed, and placed for one\r\nor two days in saturated aqueous solution of copper acetate, diluted\r\nwith an equal bulk of water, the mixture being kept at about 40° C.\r\nAfterwards transfer the pieces to 80 per cent. alcohol until required\r\nfor cutting. Or, the sections can be cut first, and then treated with\r\ncopper acetate. To stain the sections, after being well washed in 90\r\nper cent. alcohol, they are transferred to Weigert’s hæmatoxylin and\r\nleft from a few hours to two days, according to the differentiation\r\nrequired. When opaque and of a deep blue-black colour, they should be\r\nwell washed for two or three days in distilled water. Next decolourise\r\nfor 0·5 to 2 hours in a solution of 2 Gm. of borax and 2·5 Gm. of\r\npotassium ferrocyanide in 200 C.c. of water. As soon as the grey and\r\nwhite substances are sharply defined, again wash the sections in water\r\nfor half an hour, then dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nWOODHEAD’S METHOD OF STAINING TUBERCLE BACILLI.--Take a small quantity\r\nof sputum rich in bacilli, and spread it out by pressure between\r\ntwo cover-glasses, so that a fairly thin film remains on each. Then\r\ncarefully slip one over the other until they come apart. Thoroughly\r\ndry the covers, and pass them rapidly three times through the flame\r\nof a spirit lamp, care being taken not to scorch the film, then float\r\nthem face downwards on the staining solution, which has been previously\r\nprepared and filtered into a watch-glass. The stain should consist\r\nof saturated alcoholic solution of basic fuchsine, 1 part; absolute\r\nalcohol or rectified spirit, 10 parts; carbolic acid solution (5 per\r\ncent.), 10 parts. Leave the preparations in the watch-glass for 12\r\nto 24 hours, unless time is an object. In the latter case heat the\r\nfluid gently until vapour is given off, then drop the films on the\r\nsurface, and leave them for 3 to 5 minutes only. Next transfer the\r\ncovers to an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid (25 per cent.), and\r\nwhen decolourisation is complete, as evidenced by the pink colouration\r\nnot returning when the specimens are plunged into a bowl of tap-water\r\ncontaining a single drop of ammonia solution, thoroughly rinse in the\r\nslightly alkaline water and counter-stain in an aqueous solution of\r\nmethylene blue. Finally, wash in water, carefully dry and mount in\r\nCanada balsam. The bacilli should stand out as bright red rods on a\r\nblue background of cells.\r\n\r\nZIEHL-NEELSEN (_Staining Bacilli_).--Sections are removed from weak\r\nspirit into Neelsen’s carbolic fuchsine and left for 10 or 15 minutes;\r\nnext decolourise in sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1·84) or nitric acid (sp.\r\ngr. 1·42) diluted with 3 volumes of water, rinse in 60 per cent.\r\nalcohol, and wash in a large volume of water to remove the acid.\r\nTubercle and leprosy bacilli are the only micro-organisms that can\r\nretain the stain after treatment with acid. If the presence of traces\r\nof nitrous acid in the nitric acid be suspected, Squire recommends\r\nthe use of saturated aqueous solution of sulphanilic acid mixed with\r\none-third its bulk of nitric acid. The sulphanilic acid destroys any\r\nfree nitrous acid, which would otherwise exercise a bleaching action on\r\nthe fuchsine-stained bacilli. The sections may be counterstained with\r\na solution of 0·5 Gm. of methyl green (or 0·25 Gm. of methylene blue)\r\nin 20 C.c. of rectified spirit and 80 C.c. of distilled water. Finally\r\ndehydrate in absolute alcohol, clear in cedar oil, and mount in balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nTHE METRIC SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\nThe initial unit of the Metric System is the Metre or unit of length,\r\nwhich represents one ten millionth part of the earth’s quadrant, or\r\none forty-millionth part of the circumference of the earth around the\r\npoles. The multiples and sub-divisions of this and all the other units\r\nare obtained by the use of decimals, and for this reason the system is\r\nalso known as the _decimal system_. The multiples are designated by the\r\nGreek prefixes, _deca_ = 10; _hecto_ = 100; _kilo_ = 1000; _myria_ =\r\n10,000. For the sub-divisions Latin prefixes are employed, as follows:\r\n_deci_ = 1/10; _centi_ = 1/100; _milli_ = 1/1000. Thus for measures of\r\nlength we have the following expressions, showing the abbreviations\r\ncommonly employed, and the equivalents in the ordinary English\r\nstandards of measurement--\r\n\r\n  1 Myriametre, Mm.  = 10,000.0   M. =   6.2137 miles.\r\n  1 Kilometre,  Km.  =  1,000.0   M. =   0.6213 mile.\r\n  1 Hectometre, Hm.  =    100.0   M. = 109.362  yards.\r\n  1 Decametre,  Dm.  =     10.0   M. =  32.8086 feet.\r\n  1 Metre,      M.   =      1.0   M. =  39.3704 inches.\r\n  1 Decimetre,  dm.  =      0.1   M. =   3.9370   \"\r\n  1 Centimetre, cm.  =      0.01  M. =   0.3937   \"\r\n  1 Millimetre, mm.  =      0.001 M. =   0.0393   \"\r\n\r\nFrom the unit of linear measure of metre is derived the unit of the\r\nmeasure of capacity or LITRE. This represents the cube of one-tenth\r\npart of a metre, or a cubic decimetre, and its multiples and\r\nsub-divisions with their corresponding equivalents in Imperial fluid\r\nmeasure are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1 Myrialitre,      Ml. = 10,000.0   L.  =  2200.9667 imperial gallons.[91]\r\n  1 Kilolitre,       Kl. =  1,000.0   \"   =   220.0966      \"      \"\r\n  1 Hectolitre       Hl. =    100.0   \"   =    22.0096      \"      \"\r\n  1 Decalitre,       Dl. =     10.0   \"   =     2.2009       \"     \"\r\n  1 Litre,           L.  =      1.0   \"   =    35.2154 fluid ounces imperial.\r\n  1 Decilitre,       dl. =      0.1   \"   =     3.5215    \"    \"       \"\r\n  1 Centilitre,      cl. =      0.01  \"   =     0.3521    \"    \"       \"\r\n  1 Millilitre,      ml. =      0.001 \"   =     0.0352    \"    \"       \"\r\n         or\r\n  1 Cubic Centimetre, ccm. =    0.001 L.  =     0.0352    \"    \"       \"\r\n\r\nThe unit of weight in the metric system is the GRAMME. This is also\r\nderived from the metre, and represents the weight of one cubic\r\ncentimetre, of water, or the quantity of distilled water, at its\r\nmaximum density, 4° C. (39·2° F.), which would fill the cube of\r\none-hundredth part of a metre. The relative value of the gramme,\r\ntogether with its multiples and sub-divisions, as compared with the\r\nEnglish standards of weight, may be seen from the following table:--\r\n\r\n  1 Myriagramme,   Mg.  = 10,000.0  Gm. =  22.0461 pounds.\r\n  1 Kilogramme,    Kg.  =  1,000.0   \"  =   2.2046   \"\r\n  1 Hectogramme,   Hg.  =    100.0   \"  =   3.5273 ounces avoir.\r\n  1 Decagramme,    Dg.  =     10.0   \"  = 154.3235 grains.\r\n  1 Gramme,        Gm.  =      1.0   \"  =   15.4323   \"\r\n  1 Decigramme,    dg.  =      0.1   \"  =    1.5432   \"\r\n  1 Centigramme,   cg.  =      0.01  \"  =    0.1543   \"\r\n  1 Milligramme,   mg.  =      0.001 \"  =    0.0154   \"\r\n\r\nThe expression _micro-millimetre_ is used for microscopic measurements,\r\nand denotes the thousandth part of a millimetre. Of the measures of\r\ncapacity, the terms most commonly employed are the litre and the cubic\r\ncentimetre. Thus a decalitre may also be expressed as 10 litres, a\r\ncentilitre as 10 cubic centimetres, etc. Of the metric weights the\r\ngramme and its fractional parts, with their respective prefixes, are\r\nmuch used in analytical work. The kilogramme is largely employed in\r\ncommercial transactions, and is commonly abbreviated _kilo_.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison of the values of some of the more frequently employed\r\nexpressions of the metric and English systems, the following may be\r\nfound convenient for reference:--\r\n\r\n  1 mm. (millimetre) = 1/25 of an inch.\r\n  1 cm. (centimetre) = 2/5 of an inch.\r\n  1 inch = 25 millimetres or 2-1/2 centimetres.\r\n  1 mg. (milligramme) = 0.01543 grain (or approx. 1/64 grain).\r\n  1 gm. (gramme) = 15.4324 grains.\r\n  1 Kg. (“Kilo” or kilogramme) = 2 lbs. 3-1/4 ozs. av.\r\n  1 pound avoir. = 453,592 grammes.\r\n  1 ounce avoir. = 28,350 grammes.\r\n  1 grain = 0.06479 gramme or 64.79 milligrammes.\r\n  1 cc. (cubic centimetre) = 16.9 minims Imperial measure.\r\n  1 L. (litre) = 35.21 fluid ounces Imperial measure, or 33.815 fluid\r\n      ounces Wine measure.\r\n  1 fluid ounce Imperial measure = 28.350 grammes.\r\n  1 pint Imperial measure = 567.0 grammes.\r\n  1 gallon Imperial measure = 4.536 litres, or 10 lbs. avoir. of pure water\r\n      at 62° F. and under an atmospheric pressure of 30 inches of mercury.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to bear in mind that on the Continent liquids are always\r\nweighed, not measured.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN THE CENTIGRADE AND FAHRENHEIT THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n   F.

It is composed of\r\nseveral layers, the most important of which is the nerve layer,\r\nconsisting of innumerable ganglionic stellate plexus of cells held\r\ntogether by a network, as seen in Fig. 21, a small section stained by\r\nchloride of gold, and magnified 300 diameters. Beneath the nucleated\r\nnerve cells is a second layer of stellate cells, varying a little\r\nin their form. These nerve and stellate cells serve the purpose of\r\nmaintaining the cornea in health, and must play a significant part in\r\nthe dioptric system.\r\n\r\n[7] The standard condition of perfect vision is termed _emmetropia_.\r\n\r\n[8] _Landolt_; “The Accommodation and Refraction of the Eye,” 1886.\r\n\r\n[9] µ = ·001 of a millimetre. This measurement is now universally\r\nemployed in microscopy.\r\n\r\n[10] Diffraction effects may be observed without a microscope, indeed,\r\nthe more striking are seen in connection with telescopic vision. A\r\nbeautiful series of phenomena in illustration of the diffraction of\r\nlight may be produced as follows: Draw on a large sheet of paper a\r\nseries of geometrical figures, arranged at equal distances in a circle.\r\nA collodion photographic picture of these being taken, a series of\r\nsmall transparent apertures in the elsewhere opaque film will result.\r\nThis film is then mounted, so that it may be in turn brought before\r\nthe centre of a small hand telescope, previously adjusted to view an\r\nimage of the sun. In this way we have an apparatus of the most compact\r\nform, and by means of which a series of fifty or more phenomena may be\r\nbrought into view in a few minutes. These pictures being very small\r\n(occupying on an average area one-tenth of an inch in diameter),\r\ninaccuracies of surface and substance of the glass may be neglected. A\r\nfilm of Canada balsam with which the glass is cemented over the picture\r\nproduces no disturbance. There is a manifest advantage in the figures\r\nbeing small, as the size of the image is in inverse proportion to the\r\nsize of the aperture.\r\n\r\n[11] Carpenter, “The Microscope,” p. 65, 1891.\r\n\r\n[12] “Phil. Mag.,” viii., p. 167 (1896).\r\n\r\n[13] Professor Stokes wrote me in the following flattering\r\nterms:--“What you have submitted to me on the subject of apertures is\r\nso sound, clear, and succinct, that I have nothing to add to it. The\r\nmethod adapted as you have explained respecting the immersion system,\r\nI consider to be perfectly satisfactory.” Subsequently, and at my\r\nrequest, Sir George Stokes contributed a valuable paper on the subject\r\nto the “Transactions of the Royal Microscopical Society,” 1876, on “The\r\nTheoretical Limit of Aperture.”\r\n\r\n[14] “On the Estimation of Aperture in the Microscope,” “Journal of the\r\nRoyal Microscopical Society,” series ii. vol. i.; “Notes on Aperture,\r\nMicroscopic Vision, and the Value of Wide-angled Immersion Objectives,”\r\n1881.\r\n\r\n[15] _Numerical aperture_ is generally used in the sense in which\r\nit was introduced in 1873 by Professor Abbe, on the basis of his\r\ntheoretical investigations. Numerical aperture represents the ratio\r\nbetween the radius of the effective aperture (_p_) of the system\r\non the side where the image is formed--more accurately the radius\r\nof the emerging pencils measured in the upper focal plane of the\r\nobjective--and the equivalent focal length (_f_) of the latter, _i.e._,\r\n\r\n  Numerical aperture = _p_/_f_.\r\n\r\nThis ratio is equal to the product of the sine of half the angle of\r\naperture _u_ of the incident pencils and the refractive index _n_ of\r\nthe medium, situated in front of the objective. With dry lenses _n_\r\nhas therefore the value 1; with immersion lenses it is equal to the\r\nrefractive index of the particular immersion fluid:\r\n\r\n  Numerical aperture = _n_ Sin _u_.\r\n\r\nThe numerical aperture of a lens determines all its essential\r\nqualities; the brightness of the image increases with a given\r\nmagnification and, other things being equal, as the square of the\r\naperture; the resolving and defining powers are directly related to it,\r\nthe focal depth of differentiation of depths varies inversely as the\r\naperture, and so forth.

Ross have two series of eye-pieces, both Huyghenian.\r\nOne series is for use with the English 10-inch tube-body, and is\r\ndistinguished by Roman letters, and the other by numerals, and made\r\nas is usual on the Continent, and for use with the shorter tube-body\r\n6-1/2-inch. The initial powers given in the table are for the 10-inch\r\ntube, and for the shorter must be read as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1     2     3     4    }   with 6-1/2-inch tube.\r\n  4     6     8    12    }\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] This centring-glass consists of a tubular cap with a minute\r\naperture, containing two plano-convex lenses, so adjusted that the\r\nimage of the aperture in the object-glass and the images of the\r\naperture of the lenses and the diaphragms contained in the tube which\r\nholds the illuminating combination, may be all in focus at the same\r\ntime, so that by the same adjustment they may be brought sufficiently\r\nnear to recognise their centricity.\r\n\r\n[27] Summary of the value of parabolic illumination and immersion\r\nilluminators, by the late Mr. J. Mayall, will be found on p. 27,\r\n“Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society” (1879).\r\n\r\n[28] Messrs. Baker and Swift have constructed lamps with removal and\r\nfixed achromatic bull’s-eye lenses in gymbal, and changeable tinted\r\nglass screens. Either of these will add to the usefulness of the\r\nlamp in bacteriological research work. Baker’s is constructed on the\r\nHerschel doublet formula, and should therefore be free from aberration.\r\nIt is mounted on a heavy brass tripod foot, has vertical and horizontal\r\nmovements by rack and pinion, brass reservoir, with screw opening for\r\nfilling, metal chimney to take 3 × 1-1/2-inch glass slip, removable\r\nframe for carrying tinted glass screens, &c.\r\n\r\n[29] “Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society,” p. 365, 1896.\r\n\r\n[30] Dr. G.

Saville Kent, F.L.S., Op.

Drysdale and\r\nDallinger, whose joint investigations were published in the Journal\r\nof the Royal Microscopical Society, 1873-75. By employing the highest\r\nand most perfectly constructed powers of the microscope, and devoting\r\nan enormous amount of time and attention to unravelling mysteries\r\nso long associated with the production of the lowly organised\r\nflagellate organisms, monads, and patiently watching hour by hour, the\r\nlife-history of numerous species of these minute infusorial animalcules\r\nwere obtained. Not only was it discovered that these organisms\r\nincreased indefinitely by fission, but that under certain conditions\r\ntwo or more individuals were united into encystments, and whose\r\ncontents broke up into a greater or less number of spore-like bodies,\r\nwere speedily developed into the parent type. In the examination of\r\nthese minute bodies, it has been found that talc-films, that is, talc\r\nsplit into extremely fine laminæ, offer the best kind of cover, in\r\nfact, supersede ordinary glass covers, and possess an advantage, that\r\nof bending readily, thus permitting the objective to be brought close\r\ndown upon the object.\r\n\r\n[68] R. Kirkpatrick, Warne, Op. Cit., pp. 532-3.\r\n\r\n[69] Saville Kent, _op. cit._, p. 191.\r\n\r\n[70] Fritz Müller first demonstrated a nervous system in the\r\nPolyzoa:--“The nervous system of each branch consisting of--1st, a\r\nconsiderable sized ganglion situated at its origin; 2nd, of a nervous\r\ntrunk running the entire length of the branch, at the upper part\r\nof which it subdivides into branches, going to the ganglia of the\r\ninternodes arising at this part; and 3rd, of a rich nervous plexus\r\nresting on the trunk, and connecting the ganglia just mentioned, as\r\nwell as the basal ganglia of the individual polypides.” For further\r\naccount, see paper in the “Micros. Journ.,” vol. i., New Series, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[71] I have ventured to devote some considerable space to the\r\ndevelopment of the pond-snail, and for an obvious reason, that\r\nof making it perfectly clear to my readers that my microscopical\r\ninvestigations of Limnœa, made in 1853, were published in the “Journal\r\nof the Microscopical Society,” June, 1854, and republished in extenso\r\nin the several editions of this book, dating from the last mentioned\r\nperiod. Nevertheless, the fringe of cilia was, it appears, rediscovered\r\nin 1874, just twenty years after my paper was published. It is almost\r\nunnecessary to add that Carpenter gravely errs in his statement “that\r\nthe existence of the fringe of cilia in the embryo snail had been\r\noverlooked until 1874.”\r\n\r\n[72] Mr. George Rainey many years ago made us acquainted with the fact\r\nthat certain of the appearances presented by the shell or other hard\r\nstructures of animals, and which had hitherto been referred to as\r\ncell-development, are really governed by the physical laws which govern\r\nthe aggregation of certain crystalline salts when exposed to the action\r\nof vegetable and animal substances in a state of solution. Mr. Rainey\r\nfurnished a process for obtaining artificially a crystalline substance\r\nwhich shall so closely resemble shell structure that it can barely\r\nbe distinguished from it. The chemical substances to be used in the\r\npreparation of the artificial shell, or calculi, are a soluble compound\r\nof lime and carbonate of potash or soda, dissolved in separate portions\r\nof water, and mixed with some viscid vegetable or animal substance,\r\nas gum or albumen, and mixing the several solutions together. The\r\nmechanical conditions required are that such a quantity of each of the\r\nviscid materials in each solution shall be of about the same density as\r\nthat of the nascent carbonate of lime, and at perfect rest. This state\r\nof rest will require from two to three weeks or longer. Mr. Rainey\r\nshows the analogy or identity of his artificially formed crystals with\r\nthose found in natural products both in animals and vegetables, chiefly\r\nconfining himself to the structure and formation of shells and bone,\r\npigmental and other cells, and the structure and development of the\r\ncrystalline lenses, which he contends are all formed upon precisely the\r\nsame physical principles as the artificial crystals.\r\n\r\n[73] E.
