No resemblance is intended between any character\r\nherein and any person (Here or Out There), living or dead; any such\r\nresemblance is purely coincidental.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished by Pyramid Books\r\nFirst printing: _October 1961_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed in the United States of America_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Archer Five came in a big packing box, bound with steel ribbons and\r\nmarked, _This end up--handle with care_. It was delivered at a\r\nsubsidized government surplus price of fifty dollars to Hendricks'\r\nSports and Hobbies Center, a store in Jarviston, Minnesota, that used to\r\ndeal mostly in skin diving equipment, model plane kits, parts for\r\nsouping up old cars, and the like. The Archer Five was a bit obsolete\r\nfor the elegant U.S. Space Force boys--hence the fantastic drop in price\r\nfrom two thousand dollars since only last June. It was still a\r\nplenty-good piece of equipment, however; and the cost change was a real\r\nbreak for the Bunch.\r\n\r\nBy 4:30 that bright October afternoon, those members who were attending\r\nregular astronautics classes at Jarviston Technical College had gathered\r\nat Hendricks' store. Ramos and Tiflin, two wild characters with\r\nseldom-cut hair and pipe stem pants, who didn't look as if they could be\r\ntrusted with a delicate unpacking operation, broke the Archer out with a\r\ncare born of love, there in Paul Hendricks' big backroom shop, while the\r\nmore stolid members--and old Paul, silent in his swivel chair--watched\r\nlike hawks.\r\n\r\n\"So who tries it on first?\" Ramos challenged. \"Dumb question. You,\r\nEileen--naturally.\"\r\n\r\nMost Bunches have a small, hard, ponytailed member, dungareed like the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nStill kidding around, Ramos dropped an arm across Eileen Sands'\r\nshoulders, and got her sharp elbow jabbed with vigor into his stomach.\r\n\r\nShe glanced back in a feminine way at Frank Nelsen, a tall, lean guy of\r\nnineteen, butch-haircutted and snub featured. But he was the purposeful,\r\nstudious kind, more an observer and a personal doer than a leader; he\r\nhadn't much time for the encouraging smiles of girls, and donning even\r\nan Archer Five now instead of within a few hours, didn't exactly\r\nrepresent his kind of hurry.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait, Eileen,\" he said. Then he nodded toward Gimp Hines. That the\r\nothers would also pick Gimp was evident at once. There were bravos and\r\nclapping, half for a joke.\r\n\r\n\"Think I won't?\" Gimp growled, tossing his crutches on a workbench\r\nlittered with scraps of color-coded wire, and hopping forward on the one\r\nleg that had grown to normal size. He sort of swaggered, Frank Nelsen\r\nnoticed. Maybe the whole Bunch swaggered with him in a way, because,\r\nright now, he represented all of them in their difficult aim. Gimp\r\nHines, with the nylon patch in his congenitally imperfect heart, and\r\nwith that useless right underpinning, had less chance of taking part in\r\nspace-development than any of them--even with all his talent for\r\nmechanics and electronics.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two (George) Baines, a large, mild person who was an expert\r\nbricklayer in his spare time, while he struggled to absorb the intricate\r\nmath that spacemen are supposed to know--he used to protest that he\r\ncould at least add two and two--bounced forward, saying, \"I'll give yuh\r\na hand, Gimp.\"\r\n\r\nMitch Storey, the lean colored kid with the passion for all plant life,\r\nand the specific urge to get somehow out to Mars, was also moving to\r\nhelp Gimp into the Archer. Gimp waved them off angrily, but they valeted\r\nfor him, anyhow.\r\n\r\n\"Shucks, Gimp,\" Storey soothed. \"Anybody needs assistance--the first\r\ntime...\"\r\n\r\nThey got his good leg, and what there was of the other, into the boots.\r\nThey laced carefully, following all they had learned from books. They\r\nrolled the wire-braced silicone rubber body-section up over his torso,\r\nguided his arms into the sleeves, closed the zipper-sealers and centered\r\nthe chest plate. While the others checked with their eyes, they\r\ninspected the nipples of the moisture-reclaimer and chlorophane\r\nair-restorer capsules. They lifted the helmet of clear, darkened plastic\r\nover his head, and dogged it to the gasket with the automatic\r\nturnbuckles. By then, Gimp Hines' own quick fingers, in the gloves, were\r\nbusy snapping this and adjusting that. There was a sleepy hum of\r\naerating machinery.\r\n\r\n\"It even _smells_ right, in here,\" Gimp growled muffledly, trying to be\r\nnonchalant.\r\n\r\nThere was loud laughter and clapping. Ramos whistled piercingly, with\r\ntwo fingers. The huge Kuzak twins, Art and Joe--both had football\r\nscholarships at Tech--gave Indian yells. Eileen Sands clasped her hands\r\nover her head and went up on her toes like the ballet dancer she had\r\nonce meant to be. Old Paul, in his chair, chortled, and slapped his arm.\r\nEven little David Lester said \"Bravo!\" after he had gulped. The applause\r\nwasn't entirely facetious.\r\n\r\nGimp's whole self had borrowed hard lines and an air of competence from\r\nthe Archer Five. For a second he looked like somebody who could really\r\ncross millions of miles. There was a tiny, solar-powered\r\nionic-propulsion unit mounted on the shoulders of the armor, between\r\nthe water-tank and the beam-type radio transmitter and receiver. A\r\nminiaturized radar sprouted on the left elbow joint. On the inside of\r\nthe Archer's chest plate, reachable merely by drawing an arm out of a\r\nsleeve, emergency ration containers were racked. In the same place was a\r\nsmall airlock for jettisoning purposes and for taking in more supplies.\r\n\r\n\"What do yuh know--toilet facilities, yet!\" Ramos chirped with spurious\r\nnaivete, and there were guffaws which soon died out. After all, this\r\n_was_ a serious occasion, and who wanted to be a jerk? Now that the\r\nprice had been shoved down into the ground, they could probably get\r\ntheir Archer Fives--their all-important vacuum armor. They were one more\r\nhurdle nearer to the stars.\r\n\r\nTwo regular members of the Bunch hadn't yet shown up. Ten were present,\r\nincluding Gimp in the Archie. All were different. Each had a name.\r\n\r\nBut Frank Nelsen figured that numbers, names, and individual variations\r\ndidn't count for much, just then. They were a crowd with an overall\r\npersonality--often noisy, sometimes quiet like now, always a bit grim to\r\nsustain their nerve before all they had to learn in order to reduce\r\ntheir inexperienced greenness, and before the thought of all the\r\nexpensive equipment they had to somehow acquire, if they were to take\r\npart in the rapid adaptation of the solar system to human uses. Most of\r\nall, their courage was needed against fear of a region that could be\r\ndeadly dangerous, but that to them seemed wonderful like nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe shop smelled of paint, solvent and plastic, like most any other.\r\nGimp, sitting in the Archer, beside the oil-burning stove, didn't say\r\nany more. He forgot to play tough, and seemed to lose himself in a\r\nmind-trip Out There--probably as far as he would ever get. His face,\r\ninside the helmet, now looked pinched. His freckles were very plain in\r\nhis paled cheeks. Gimp was awed.\r\n\r\nSo was everybody else, including Paul Hendricks, owner of the Hobby\r\nCenter, who was approaching eighty and was out of the running, though\r\nhis watery blue eyes were still showing the shine of boyhood, right now.\r\n\r\nWay back, Paul Hendricks used to barnstorm county fairs in a\r\nwood-and-fabric biplane, giving thrill rides to sports and their girls\r\nat five dollars a couple, because he had been born sixty years too soon.\r\n\r\nMuch later in his spotty career, he had started the store. He had also\r\nmeant to do general repair work in the backroom shop. But in recent\r\nyears it had degenerated into an impromptu club hall, funk hole,\r\ngriping-arguing-and-planning pit, extracurricular study lab and project\r\nsite for an indefinite horde of interplanetary enthusiasts who were\r\nthought of in Jarviston as either young adults of the most resourceful\r\nkind--for whom the country should do much more in order to insure its\r\nfuture in space--or as just another crowd of delinquents, more bent on\r\nsuicide and trouble-making than any hot rod group had ever been. Paul\r\nHendricks was either a fine, helpful citizen--among so many who were\r\ndisinterested and preoccupied--or a corrupting Socrates who deserved to\r\ndrink hemlock.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen knew all this as well as most. He had been acquainted with\r\nPaul ever since, at the age of seven, he had come into the store and had\r\ntried to make a down payment on a model building kit for a Y-71\r\nground-to-orbit freight rocket--clearly marked $49.95 in the display\r\nwindow--with his fortune of a single dime. Frank had never acquired a\r\nY-71 kit, but he had found a friend in Paul Hendricks, and a place to\r\nhang around and learn things he wanted to know. Later on, as now, he had\r\nworked in the store whenever he had some free time.\r\n\r\nFrank leaned against a lathe, watching the others, the frosty thrill and\r\nsoul-searching hidden inside himself. Maybe it was hard to guess what\r\nEileen Sands, standing near, was thinking, but she was the firm kind who\r\nwould have a definite direction. Perhaps unconsciously, she hummed a\r\ntune under her breath, while her feet toyed with graceful steps. No\r\ndoubt, her mind was also on the Big Vacuum beyond the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut what is there about a dangerous dream? When it is far out of reach,\r\nit has a safe, romantic appeal. Bring its fulfillment a little closer,\r\nand its harsh aspects begin to show. You get a kick out of that, but you\r\nbegin to wonder nervously if you have the guts, the stamina, the\r\nresistance to loneliness and complete strangeness.\r\n\r\nLooking at a real Archie--with a friend inside it, even--did this to\r\nFrank Nelsen. But he could see similar reactions in some of the others.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey sat, bent forward, on a box, staring at his big, sepia\r\nhands, in which he tossed back and forth a tiny, clear capsule\r\ncontaining a fuzzy fragment of vegetation from Mars. He had bought this\r\nsealed curio from Paul a year ago for fifty dollars--souvenirs that came\r\nfrom so far were expensive. And now, in view of what was happening to\r\nhopeful colonists of that once inhabited and still most Earth-like other\r\nplanet, ownership of such a capsule on Earth seemed about to be banned,\r\nnot only by departments of agriculture, but by bodies directly concerned\r\nwith public safety.\r\n\r\nDid the color photographs of Mars, among all the others that the Bunch\r\nhad thumbtacked to the shop walls, still appeal as strongly to Mitch?\r\nDid he still want to go out to that world of queer, swirled markings,\r\nlike the fluid flow in the dregs of a paper coffee cup? Mitch\r\nwould--more so than ever. He had plant life in his soul, maybe from\r\nwandering in the swamps near his home in Mississippi. He had been\r\nsupporting himself here at school by fixing gardens. If it was plant\r\nlife of a different, dangerous sort, with other billions of years of\r\ndevelopment behind it, that just made the call stronger. Mitch just sat\r\nand thought, now, the mouth organ he seldom played sagging forward in\r\nhis frayed shirt pocket.\r\n\r\nRamos--Miguel Ramos Alvarez--only stood with his black-visored cap\r\npushed back on his head, and a cocky smirk of good humor on his mouth.\r\nReckless Ramos, who went tearing around the country in an ancient motor\r\nscooter, decorated with squirrel tails and gaudy bosses, would hardly be\r\ndisturbed by any risky thing he wanted to do. The thumbtacked pictures\r\nof the systems of far, cold Jupiter and Saturn--Saturn still\r\nunapproached, except by small, instrumented rockets--would be the things\r\nto appeal to him.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzak twins stood alertly, as if an extra special homecoming\r\nfootball game was in prospect. But they weren't given to real doubts,\r\neither. From their previous remarks it was clear that the asteroids,\r\nthose fragments of an exploded and once populated world, orbiting out\r\nbeyond Mars, would be for them. Osmium, iridium, uranium. The rich,\r\nmetallic guts of a planet exposed for easy mining. Thousands of\r\nprospectors, hopeful characters, and men brutalized by the life in\r\nspace, were already drifting around in the Asteroid Belt.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two Baines wore a worried, perplexed expression. He was a\r\nmassive, rather lost young man who had to keep up with the times, and\r\nwith his companions, and was certainly wondering if he was able.\r\n\r\nLittle David Lester, the pedant, the mother's boy, who looked eighteen\r\nbut was probably older, pouted, and his heavy lips in his thin face\r\nmoved. \"Cores,\" Nelsen heard him whisper. He had the habit of talking to\r\nhimself. Frank knew his interests. Drill cores withdrawn from the strata\r\nof another planet, and inspected for fossils and other evidences of its\r\nlong history, was what he probably meant. Seeing Gimp in the Archie had\r\nset off another scientific reverie in his head. He was a whizz in any\r\nbook subject. Maybe he had the brains to be a great investigator of the\r\npast, in the Belt or on Mars, if his mind didn't crack first, which\r\nseemed sure to happen if he left Earth at all.\r\n\r\nBut it was Glen Tiflin's reactions that were the strangest. He had his\r\nswitch blade out, and was tossing it expertly against a wall\r\ntwo-by-four, in which it stuck quivering each time. This seemed his one\r\nskill, his pride, his proof of manhood. And he wanted to get into space\r\nlike nobody else around, except maybe Gimp Hines. It wasn't hard to\r\nsense how his head worked--the whole Bunch knew.\r\n\r\nTiflin's face seemed to writhe, now, with self-doubt and truculence; his\r\neyes were on the photos of the heroes, beginning way back; Goddard. Von\r\nBraun. Clifford, who had first landed on the far side of the Moon.\r\nLaCrosse, who had reached Mercury, closest to the sun. Vasiliev, who had\r\njust come back from the frozen moons of Jupiter, scoring a triumph for\r\nthe Tovies--somebody had started calling them that, a few years ago--up\r\nin high Eurasia, the other side of an ideological rift that still\r\nthreatened the ever more crowded and competitive Earth, though mutual\r\nfear had so far kept the flare ups within limits. Bannon, whose\r\nexpedition was even now exploring the gloomy cellar of Venus' surface,\r\nsmothered in steam, carbon dioxide and poisonous formaldehyde.\r\n\r\nTo Tiflin, as to the others, even such places were glamorous. But he\r\nwanted to be a big shot, too. It was like a compulsion. He was touchy\r\nand difficult. Three years back, he had been in trouble for breaking and\r\nentering. Maybe his worship of space, and his desire to get there and\r\nprove himself, were the only things that had kept him straight for so\r\nlong--grimly attentive at Tech, and at work at his car-washing job,\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nIn his nervousness, now, he stuck a cigarette savagely between his lips,\r\nand lighted it with a quick, arrogant gesture, hardly slowing down the\r\ncontinuous toss and recovery of his knife.\r\n\r\nThis had begun to annoy big Art Kuzak. For one thing, Tiflin was doing\r\nhis trick too close to the mass of crinkly, cellophane-like stuff draped\r\nover a horizontal wooden pole suspended by iron straps from the ceiling.\r\nThe crinkly mass was one of the Bunch's major projects--their first\r\nspace bubble, or bubb which they had been cutting and shaping with more\r\ncare and devotion than skill.\r\n\r\n\"Cripes--put that damn shiv away, Tif!\" Art snapped. \"Or lose it\r\nsomeplace!\"\r\n\r\nRamos, who was a part-time mechanic at the same garage where Tiflin\r\nworked, couldn't help taunting. \"Yeah--smoking, too. Oh-oh. Using up\r\nprecious oxygen. Better quit, pal. Can't do much of that Out There.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a wrong moment to rib Tiflin. He was in an instant flare. But\r\nhe ground out the cigarette at once, bitterly. \"What do _you_ care what\r\nI do, Mex?\" he snarled. \"And as for you two Hunky Kuzaks--you oversized\r\nbulldozers--how about weight limits for blastoff? Damn--I don't care\r\n_how_ big you are!\"\r\n\r\nIn mounting rage, he was about to lash out with his fists, even at the\r\ntwo watchful football men. But then he looked surprised. With a terrible\r\neffort, he bottled up even his furious words.\r\n\r\nThe Bunch was a sort of family. Members of families may love each other,\r\nbut it doesn't have to happen. For a second it was as if Ramos had\r\nTiflin spitted on some barb of his taunting smile--aimed at Tiflin's\r\nmost vulnerable point.\r\n\r\nRamos clicked his tongue. What he was certainly going to remark was that\r\npeople who couldn't pass the emotional stability tests, just couldn't\r\nget a space-fitness card. But Ramos wasn't unkind. He checked himself in\r\ntime. \"No sweat, Tif,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Gimp--are you going to sit in that Archie all night?\" Joe Kuzak,\r\nthe easy-going twin, boomed genially. \"How about the rest of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--how about that, Gimp?\" Dave Lester put in, trying to sound as\r\nbrash and bold as the others, instead of just bookish.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two Baines, still looking perplexed, spoke in a hoarse voice\r\nthat sounded like sorrow. \"What I wanna know is just how far this fifty\r\nbuck price gets us. Guess we have enough dough left in the treasury to\r\nbuy us each an Archer Five, huh, Paul?\"\r\n\r\nPaul Hendricks rubbed his bald head and grinned in a way that attempted\r\nto prove him a disinterested sideliner. \"Ask Frank,\" he said. \"He's your\r\nhistorian-secretary and treasurer.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen came out of his attitude of observation enough to warn,\r\n\"That much we've got, if we want as many as twelve Archies. And a little\r\nbetter than a thousand dollars more, left over from the prize money.\"\r\n\r\nThey had won twenty-five hundred dollars during the summer for building\r\na working model of a sun-powered ionic drive motor--the kind useful for\r\ndeep-space propulsion, but far too weak in thrust to be any good,\r\nstarting from the ground. The contest had been sponsored by--of all\r\noutfits--a big food chain, Trans-Columbia. But this wasn't so strange.\r\nEverybody was interested in, or affected by, interplanetary travel, now.\r\n\r\nOn a workbench, standing amid a litter of metal chips and scraps of\r\ncolor-coded wire, was the Bunch's second ionic, full-size this time, and\r\nalmost finished. On crossed arms it mounted four parabolic mirrors; its\r\nion guide was on a universal joint. Out There, in orbit or beyond, and\r\nin full, spatial sunlight, its jetting ions would deliver ten pounds of\r\ncontinuous thrust.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand bucks--that's nowhere near enough,\" Two-and-Two mourned\r\nfurther. \"Doggone, why can't we get blasted up off the Earth--that costs\r\nthe most, all by itself--just in our Archies? They've got those little\r\nionic drives on their shoulders, to get around with, after we're in\r\norbit. Lots of asteroid hoppers live and ride only in their space suits.\r\nWhy do they make us get all that other expensive equipment? Space bubbs,\r\nfull-size ionics, lots of fancy instruments!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause it isn't legal, otherwise,\" Mitch Storey pointed out. \"'Cause\r\nnew men are green--it isn't safe for them, otherwise--the\r\nExtra-Terrestrial Commission thinks. Got to have all the gear to get\r\nclearance. Travelling light isn't even legal in the Belt. You know\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we'll win us another prize,\" Ramos laughed, touching the crinkly\r\nsubstance of their first bubb, hanging like a deflated balloon over the\r\nceiling pole.\r\n\r\nTiflin sneered. \"Oh, sure, you dumb Mex. Too many other Bunches, now.\r\nToo much competition. Like companies starting up on the Moon not hiring\r\nordinary help on Earth and shipping them out, anymore--saying contract\r\nguys don't stick. Nuts--it's because enough slobs save them the expense\r\nby showing up on their own... Or like most all of us trying to get into\r\nthe Space Force. The _Real Elite_--sure. Only 25,000 in the Force, when\r\nthere are over 200,000,000 people in the country to draw from. Just one\r\nguy from Jarviston--Harv Diamond--ever made it. Choosy? We can get old\r\nwaiting for them to review our submitted personal data, only to have a\r\nchance to take their lousy tests!\"\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak grinned. \"So down with 'em--down with the worthy old U.S.S.F.!\r\nWe're on our own--to Serenitatis Base on the Moon, to the Belt,\r\nPallastown, and farther!\"\r\n\r\nRamos still hovered near Eileen Sands. \"What do you say, Sweetie?\" he\r\nasked. \"You haven't hardly made a comment.\"\r\n\r\nEileen remained tough and withdrawn. \"I'm just listening while you smart\r\nmale characters figure out everything,\" she snapped. \"Why don't you\r\nbecome a listener, too, for a change, and go help Gimp out of that\r\nArcher?\"\r\n\r\nRamos bowed elegantly, and obeyed the latter half of her suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"I have a premonition--a hunch,\" little Lester offered, trying to sound\r\nfirm. \"Our request for a grant from the Extra-Terrestrial Development\r\nBoard will succeed. Because we will be as valuable as anybody, Out\r\nThere. Then we will have money enough to buy the materials to make most\r\nof our equipment.\"\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak, the gentler twin, answered him. \"You're right about one\r\nthing, Les. We'll wind up building most of our own stuff--with our own\r\nmitts...!\"\r\n\r\nSome noisy conversation about who should try the Archer next, was\r\ninterrupted when the antique customer's bell over the street door of\r\nthe store, jangled. There was a scrape of shoe soles, as the two\r\npreviously absent members of the Bunch, Jig Hollins and Charlie\r\nReynolds, arriving together by chance, came into the shop.\r\n\r\nJig (Hilton) Hollins was a mechanic out at the airport. He was lean,\r\ncocky, twenty-four, with a stiff bristle of blond hair. Like Charlie\r\nReynolds, he added up what had just been happening, here, at a glance.\r\nBoth were older than the others. They had regular jobs. Their educations\r\nwere completed, except for evening supplementary courses.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the _men_ have arrived,\" Jig announced.\r\n\r\nMaybe Charlie Reynolds' faint frown took exception to this remark. He\r\nwas the only one in a suit, grey and tasteful, with a subdued flash to\r\nmatch the kind of car he drove. Few held this against him, nor the fact\r\nthat he usually spent himself broke, nor the further fact that J. John\r\nReynolds, tight-fisted president of the Jarviston First National Bank,\r\nwas his grandfather. Charlie was an engineer at the new nuclear\r\npowerhouse, just out of town. Charlie was what is generally known as a\r\nGood Guy. He was brash and sure--maybe too sure. He had a slight\r\nswagger, balanced by a certain benignancy. He was automatically the\r\nleader of the Bunch, held most likely to succeed in their aims.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, gang,\" he breezed. \"Otto is bringing beer, Pepsi and sandwiches\r\nfrom his joint across the street. Special day--so it's on me. Time to\r\nrelax--maybe unsnarl. Any new problems?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still plenty of old ones,\" Frank Nelsen commented laconically.\r\n\r\n\"Has anybody suddenly decided to back out?\" Charlie chuckled. \"It's\r\ntiresome for me always to be asking that.\" He looked around, meeting\r\ncarefully easy grins and grim expressions. \"Nope--I guess we're all\r\nshaggy folk, bent on high and wild living, so far. So you know the only\r\nanswer we _can_ have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Umhmm, Charlie,\" Art Kuzak, the tough, business-like twin, gruffed. \"We\r\ncan get the Archers, now. I think Frank has our various sizes noted\r\ndown. Let everybody sign up that wants an Archie. Better hurry,\r\nthough--there'll be a run on them now that they're being almost given\r\naway... List all the other stuff we need--with approximate purchase\r\nprice, or cost of construction materials, attached. Sure--we'll be way\r\nshort of funds. But we can start with the items we can make, ourselves,\r\nnow. The point is not to lose time. New restrictions may turn up, and\r\ngive us trouble, if we do. We'll have to ride our luck for a break.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell--you know the lists are ready, Art,\" Frank Nelsen pointed out. \"A\r\nbubb for everybody--or the stuff to make it. Full-scale ionic drives,\r\nair-restorers and moisture-reclaimers, likewise. Some of the navigation\r\ninstruments we'll almost have to buy. Dehydrated food, flasks of oxygen\r\nand water, and blastoff drums to contain our gear, are all relatively\r\nsimple. Worst, of course, is the blastoff price, from one of the\r\nspaceports. Who could be rich enough to have a ground-to-orbit nuclear\r\nrocket of his own? Fifteen hundred bucks--a subsidized rate at\r\nthat--just to lift a man and a thousand pounds of equipment into orbit.\r\nFive thousand dollars, minimum per person, is what we're going to need,\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\nGimp Hines, who always acted as if he expected to get off the Earth,\r\ntoo, had yielded his position inside the Archer to Tiflin, and had\r\nhobbled close.\r\n\r\n\"The cost scares a guy who has to go to school, too, so he can pass the\r\ntests,\" he said. \"Well, don't worry, Frank. A thousand dollars buys a\r\nlot of stellene for bubbs. And we can scratch up a few bucks of our own.\r\nI can find a hundred, myself, saved from my TV repair work, and my\r\nnovelties business. Charlie, here, ought to be able to contribute a\r\nthousand. Same for you, Hollins. That'll buy parts and materials for\r\nsome ionic motors, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, Gimp,\" Hollins growled.\r\n\r\nBut Charlie Reynolds grinned. \"I can kick in that much, if I hold down a\r\nwhile,\" he said. \"Maybe more, later. What we've got to have, however, is\r\na loan. We can't expect a grant from the Board. Sure they want more\r\npeople helping to develop resources in space, but they're swamped with\r\nrequests. Let's not sweat, though. With a little time, I'll swing\r\nsomething... Hey, everybody! Proposition! I move that whoever wants an\r\nArcher put his name down for Frank. I further move that we have him\r\norder us a supply of stellene, and basic materials for at least three\r\nmore ionic motors. I also suggest that everybody donate as much cash as\r\nhe can, no matter how little, and as much time as possible for making\r\nequipment. With luck, and if we get our applications for space-fitness\r\ntests mailed to Minneapolis within a week, at least some of us should\r\nget off Earth by next June. Now, shall we sign for the whole deal?\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak hunched his shoulders and displayed white teeth happily. \"I'm\r\na pushover,\" he said. \"Here I come. I like to see things roll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likewise,\" said his brother, Joe. Their signatures were both small, in\r\ncontrast to their size.\r\n\r\nRamos, fully clad in the Archer, clowned his way forward to write his\r\nname with great flourishes, his ball point clutched in a space glove.\r\n\r\nTiflin made a fierce, nervous scrawl.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey wrote patiently, in big, square letters.\r\n\r\nGimp chewed his lip, and signed, \"Walter Hines,\" in a beautiful, austere\r\nscript, with a touch as fine as a master scientist's. \"I'll go along as\r\nfar as they let me,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be the same--in my case,\" David Lester stammered. He\r\nshook so much that his signature was only a quavering line.\r\n\r\n\"For laughs,\" Eileen Sands said, and wrote daintily.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two Baines gulped, sighed, and made a jagged scribble, like the\r\ntrail of a rocket gone nuts.\r\n\r\nJig Hollins wrote in swooping, arrogant circles, that came, perhaps,\r\nfrom his extra jobs as an advertising sky writer with an airplane.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen was next, and Charlie Reynolds was last. Theirs were the\r\nmost indistinctive signatures in the lot. Just ordinary writing.\r\n\r\n\"So here we all are, on a piece of paper--pledged to victory or death,\"\r\nReynolds laughed. \"Anyhow, we're out of a rut.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen figured that that was the thing about Charlie Reynolds. Some\r\nmight not like him, entirely. But he could get the Bunch unsnarled and\r\nin motion.\r\n\r\nOld Paul Hendricks had come back from waiting on some casual customers\r\nin the store.\r\n\r\n\"Want to sign, too, Paul?\" Reynolds chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"Nope--that would make thirteen,\" Paul answered, his eyes twinkling.\r\n\"I'll watch and listen--and maybe tell you if I think you're off beam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here comes Otto with the beer and sandwiches,\" Ramos burst out.\r\n\r\nThey all crowded around heavy Otto Kramer and his basket--all except\r\nFrank Nelsen and Paul Hendricks, and Eileen Sands who made the ancient\r\ntypewriter click in the little office-enclosure, as she typed up the\r\norder list that Nelsen would mail out with a bank draft in the morning.\r\n\r\nNelsen had a powerful urge to talk to the old man who was his long-time\r\nfriend, and who had said little all during the session, though he knew\r\nmore about space travel than any of them--as much as anybody can know\r\nwithout ever having been off the Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Paul,\" Frank called in a low tone, leaning his elbows across a\r\nworkbench.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" Frank Nelsen answered with a lopsided smile.\r\n\r\nBut he felt that that was the right word, when your thoughts and\r\nfeelings became too huge and complicated for you to express with any\r\nease.\r\n\r\nGrandeur, poetry, music--for instance, the haunting popular song, _Fire\r\nStreak_, about the burial of a spaceman--at orbital speed--in the\r\natmosphere of his native planet. And fragments of history, such as\r\ncovered wagons. All sorts of subjects, ideas and pictures were swirling\r\ninside his head. Wanting to sample everything in the solar system...\r\nHome versus the distance, and the fierce urge to build a wild history of\r\nhis own... Gentleness and lust to be fulfilled, sometime. There would be\r\na girl... And there were second thoughts to twist your guts and make you\r\nwonder if all your savage drives were foolish. But there was a duty to\r\nbe equal to your era--helping to give dangerously crowded humanity on\r\nEarth more room, dispersal, a chance for race survival, if some\r\nunimaginable violence were turned loose...\r\n\r\nHe thought of the names of places Out There. Serenitatis\r\nBase--Serene--on the Moon. Lusty, fantastic Pallastown, on the Golden\r\nAsteroid, Pallas... He remembered his parents, killed in a car wreck\r\njust outside of Jarviston, four Christmases ago. Some present!... But\r\nthere was one small benefit--he was left free to go where he wanted,\r\nwithout any family complications, like other guys might have. Poor Dave\r\nLester. How was it that his mother allowed him to be with the Bunch at\r\nall? How did he work it? Or was she the one that was right?...\r\n\r\nPaul Hendricks had leaned his elbows on the workbench, too.\r\n\"Sure--_nothing_--Frank,\" he said, and his watery eyes were bland.\r\n\r\nThe old codger understood. Neither of them said anything for a minute,\r\nwhile the rest of the Bunch, except Eileen who was still typing, guzzled\r\nPepsi and beer, and wolfed hotdogs. There was lots of courage-lifting\r\nnoise and laughter.\r\n\r\nRamos said something, and Jig Hollins answered him back. \"Think there'll\r\nbe any girls in grass skirts out in the Asteroid Belt, Mex?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll arrive,\" Ramos assured him.\r\n\r\nNelsen didn't listen anymore. His and Paul's attention had wandered to\r\nthe largest color photo thumbtacked to the wall, above the TV set, and\r\nthe shelf of dog-eared technical books. It showed a fragile, pearly\r\nring, almost diaphanous, hanging tilted against spatial blackness and\r\npinpoint stars. Its hub was a cylindrical spindle, with radial guys of\r\nfine, stainless steel wire. It was like the earliest ideas about a space\r\nstation, yet it was also different. To many--Frank Nelsen and Paul\r\nHendricks certainly included--such devices had as much beauty as a yacht\r\nunder full sail had ever had for anybody.\r\n\r\nOld Paul smirked with pleasure. \"It's a shame, ain't it, Frank--calling\r\na pretty thing like that a 'bubb'--it's an ugly word. Or even a 'space\r\nbubble.' Technical talk gets kind of cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Frank Nelsen answered. \"Our first one, here, could look\r\njust as nice--inflated, and riding free against the stars.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched the crinkly material, draped across its wooden support.\r\n\r\n\"It _will_,\" the old man promised. \"Funny--not so long ago people\r\nthought that space ships would have to be really rigid--all metal. So\r\nhow did they turn out? Made of stellene, mostly--an improved form of\r\npolyethylene--almost the same stuff as a weather balloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few millimeters thick, light, perfectly flexible when deflated,\"\r\nNelsen added. \"Cut out and cement your bubb together in any shape you\r\nchoose. Fold it up firmly, like a parachute--it makes a small package\r\nthat can be carried up into orbit in a blastoff rocket with the best\r\nefficiency. There, attached flasks of breathable atmosphere fill it out\r\nin a minute. Eight pounds pressure makes it fairly solid in a vacuum.\r\nSo, behold--you've got breathing and living room, inside. There's nylon\r\ncording for increased strength--as in an automobile tire--though not\r\nnearly as much. There's a silicone gum between the thin double layers,\r\nto seal possible meteor punctures. A darkening lead-salt impregnation in\r\nthe otherwise transparent stellene cuts radiation entry below the danger\r\nlevel, and filters the glare and the hard ultra-violet out of the\r\nsunshine. So there you are, all set up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rig your hub and guy wires,\" old Paul carried on, cheerfully. \"Attach\r\nyour sun-powered ionic drive, set up your air-restorer, spin your\r\nvehicle for centrifuge-gravity, and you're ready to move--out of orbit.\"\r\n\r\nThey laughed, because getting into space wasn't as easy as they made it\r\nsound. The bubbs, one of the basic inventions that made interplanetary\r\ntravel possible, were, for all their almost vagabondish simplicity,\r\nstill a concession in lightness and compactness for atmospheric transit,\r\nto that first and greatest problem--breaking the terrific initial grip\r\nof Earth's gravity from the ground upward, and gaining stable orbital\r\nspeed. Only a tremendously costly rocket, with a thrust greater than its\r\nown weight when fully loaded, could do that. Buying a blastoff passage\r\n_had_ to be expensive.\r\n\r\n\"Figuring, scrounging, counting our pennies, risking our necks,\" Nelsen\r\nchuckled. \"And maybe, even if we make it, we'll be just a third-rate\r\ngroup, lost in the crowd that's following the explorers... Just the\r\nsame, I wish you could plan to go, too, Paul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't rub it in, kid. But I figure on kicking in a couple of thousand\r\nbucks, soon, to help you characters along.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen felt an embarrassed lift of hope.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't, Paul,\" he advised. \"We've overrun and taken possession\r\nof your shop--almost your store, too. You've waived any profit, whenever\r\nwe've bought anything. That's enough favors.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dough, my pleasure... Let's each get one of Reynolds' beers and\r\nhotdogs, if any are left...\"\r\n\r\nLater, when all the others had gone, except Gimp Hines, they uncovered\r\nthe Archer, which everyone else had tried. Paul got into it, first. Then\r\nNelsen took his turn, sitting as if within an inclosed vault, hearing\r\nthe gurgle of bubbles passing through the green, almost living fluid of\r\nthe air-restorer capsule. Chlorophane, like the chlorophyl of green\r\nplants, could break up exhaled carbon dioxide, freeing the oxygen for\r\nre-breathing. But it was synthetic, far more efficient, and it could use\r\nmuch stronger sunlight as an energy source. Like chlorophyl, too, it\r\nproduced edible starches and sugars that could be imbibed, mixed with\r\nwater, through a tube inside the Archer's helmet.\r\n\r\nEven with the Archer enclosing him, Nelsen's mind didn't quite reach. He\r\nhad learned a lot about space, but it remained curiously inconceivable\r\nto him. He felt the frost-fringed thrill.\r\n\r\n\"Now we know--a little,\" he chortled, after he stood again, just in his\r\nusual garb.\r\n\r\nIt was almost eight o'clock. Gimp Hines hadn't gone to supper, or to\r\ncelebrate decision on one of the last evenings of any kind of freedom\r\nfrom work. He couldn't wait for that... Under fluorescent lights, he was\r\nthreading wire through miniature grommets, hurrying to complete the\r\nfull-size ionic drive. He said, \"Hi, Frank,\" and let his eyes drop,\r\nagain, into absorption in his labors. Mad little guy. Tragic, sort of. A\r\ncripple...\r\n\r\n\"I'll shove off, Paul,\" Nelsen was saying in a moment.\r\n\r\nOut under the significant stars of the crisp October night, Nelsen was\r\napproached at once by a shadow. \"I was waiting for you, Frank. I got a\r\nproblem.\" The voice was hoarse sorrow--almost lugubrious comedy.\r\n\r\n\"Math again, Two-and-Two? Sure--shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--that kind is always around--with me,\" Two-and-Two Baines chuckled\r\nshakily. \"This is something else--personal. We're liable--honest to\r\ngosh--to _go_, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of us, maybe,\" Nelsen replied warily. \"Sixty thousand bucks for\r\nthe whole Bunch looks like a royal heap of cabbage to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Split among a dozen guys, it looks smaller,\" Two-and-Two persisted.\r\n\"And you can earn royal dough on the Moon--just for example. Plenty to\r\npay back a loan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, you don't pick loans off trees,\" Nelsen gruffed. \"Not for a\r\nshoestring crowd like us. We look too unsubstantial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Frank--have that part your way. I believe there still is a good\r\nchance we _will_ go. I _want_ to go. But I get to thinking. Out There is\r\nlike being buried in millions of miles of nothing that you can breathe.\r\nCan a guy stand it? You hear stories about going loopy from\r\nclaustrophobia and stuff. And I got to think about my mother and dad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh--other people could be having minor second thoughts--including\r\nme,\" Frank Nelsen growled.\r\n\r\n\"You don't get what I mean, Frank. Sure I'm scared some--but I'm gonna\r\ntry to go. Well, here's my point. I'm strong, willing, not too clumsy.\r\nBut I'm no good at figuring what to do. So, Out There, in order to have\r\na reasonable chance, I'll have to be following somebody smart. I thought\r\nI'd fix it now--beforehand. You're the best, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen felt the scared earnestness of the appeal, and the achy shock of\r\nthe compliment. But in his own uncertainty, he didn't want to be\r\ncarrying any dead weight, in the form of a dependent individual.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Two-and-Two,\" he said. \"But I can't see myself as any leader,\r\neither. Talk about it to me tomorrow, if you still feel like it. Right\r\nnow I want to sweat out a few things for myself--alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Frankie.\" And Two-and-Two was gone.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen looked upward, over the lighted street. There was no\r\nMoon--site of many enterprises, these days--in the sky, now. Old Jupiter\r\nrode in the south. A weather-spotting satellite crept across zenith,\r\nwinking red and green. A skip glider, an orbit-to-ground freight\r\nvehicle, possibly loaded with rich metals from the Belt, probably about\r\nto land at the New Mexico spaceport far to the west, moved near it.\r\nFrank felt a deliciously lonesome chill as he walked through the\r\nbusiness section of Jarviston. From somewhere, dance music lilted.\r\n\r\nIn front of Lehman's Drug Store he looked skyward again, to see a\r\ndazzling white cluster, like many meteors, falling. The gorgeous display\r\nlasted more than a second.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Franklin Nelsen--what was that?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the slight, aging woman, and stiffened slightly. Miss\r\nRosalie Parks had been his Latin teacher in high school. Plenty of times\r\nshe used to scold him for not having his translations of Caesar worked\r\nout. A lot she understood about a fella who had to spend plenty of time\r\nworking to support himself, while attending school!\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Miss Parks,\" he greeted rather stiffly. \"I think it was\r\nthat manned weather satellite dumping garbage. It hits the atmosphere at\r\norbital velocity, and is incinerated.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be immensely pleased and amused. \"Garbage becoming beauty!\r\nThat is rather wonderful, Franklin. I'll remember. Thank you and good\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nShe marched off with the small purchase she had made, in the direction\r\nopposite his own.\r\n\r\nHe got almost to the house where he had his room, when there was another\r\nencounter. But it was nothing new to run into Nancy Codiss, the spindly\r\nfifteen-year-old next door. He had a sudden, unbelievably expansive\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Nance,\" he said. \"I didn't get much supper. Let's go down to\r\nLehman's for a hamburger and maybe a soda.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--_good_--Frankie!\"\r\n\r\nThey didn't talk very much, walking down, waiting for their orders, or\r\neating their hamburgers. But she wasn't as spindly as he used to think.\r\nAnd her dark hair, even features and slim hands were nicer than he\r\nrecalled.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you fellas got your space-armor sample, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep--we did. We're ordering more.\"\r\n\r\nHer expression became speculative. Her brown eyes lighted. \"I've been\r\nwondering if I should look Outward, too. Whether it makes sense--for a\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could be--I've heard.\"\r\n\r\nTheir conversation went something like that, throughout, with long\r\nsilences. Finally she smiled at him, very brightly.\r\n\r\n\"The Junior Fall dance is in two weeks,\" she said. \"But I guess you'll\r\nbe too busy to be interested?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Guess' just isn't the word, Nance. I regret that--truly.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked and sounded as though he meant it. In some crazy way, it\r\nseemed that he _did_ mean it.\r\n\r\nHe walked her home. Then he went to the next house, and up to his rented\r\nroom. He showered, and for once climbed very early into bed, feeling\r\nthat he must have nightmares. About strange sounds in the thin winds,\r\nover the mysterious thickets of Mars. Or about some blackened, dried-out\r\nbody of a sentient being, sixty million years dead, floating free in the\r\nAsteroid Belt. A few had been found. Some were in museums.\r\n\r\nInstead, he slept the dreamless sleep of the just--if there was any\r\nparticular reason for him to consider himself just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nGimp Hines put the finishing touches on the first full-scale ionic\r\nduring that next week. The others of the Bunch, each working when he\r\ncould, completed cementing the segments of the first bubb together.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday morning they carried the bubb out into the yard behind the\r\nstore and test inflated the thirty-foot ring by means of a line of hose\r\nfrom the compressor in the shop. Soapsuds dabbed along the seams\r\nrevealed a few leaks by its bubbling. These were fixed up.\r\n\r\nBy late afternoon the Bunch had folded up the bubb again, and were\r\nsimulating its practice launching from a ground-to-orbit rocket--as well\r\nas can be done on the ground with a device intended only for use in a\r\nstate of weightlessness, when the operators are supposed to be\r\nweightless, too. The impossibility of establishing such conditions\r\nproduced some ludicrous results:\r\n\r\nThe two Kuzaks diving with a vigor, as if from a rocket airlock, hitting\r\nthe dirt with a thud, scrambling up, opening and spreading the great\r\nbundle, attaching the air hose. Little Lester hopping in to help fit\r\nwire rigging, most of it still imaginary. A friendly dog coming over to\r\nsniff, with a look of mild wonder in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh, you leather-heads!\" Art Kuzak roared at the others. He grinned,\r\nwiping his muddy face. \"We've got to learn, don't we? Only, it's like\r\nmake-believe. Hell, I haven't played make-believe since I was four! But\r\nif we keep doing it here, all the kids and townspeople will be peeking\r\nover the fence to see how nuts we've gone.\"\r\n\r\nThis was soon literally true. In some embarrassment, the Bunch rolled up\r\ntheir bubb and lugged it into the shop.\r\n\r\n\"I can borrow a construction compressor unit on a truck,\" Two-and-Two\r\noffered. \"And there's a farm I know...\"\r\n\r\nA great roll of stellene tubing, to have a six-feet six-inch inside\r\ndiameter when inflated, was delivered on Monday. Enough for three bubbs.\r\nThe Archer Fives were expected to be somewhat delayed, due to massive\r\nordering. But small boxes of parts and raw stock for the ionics had\r\nbegun to arrive, too. Capacitors, resistors, thermocouple units.\r\nMagnesium rods for Storey or Ramos or the Kuzaks to shape in a lathe.\r\nSheet aluminum to be spun and curved and polished. With Eileen Sands\r\nhelping, Gimp Hines would do most of that.\r\n\r\nSo the real work began. Nobody in the Bunch denied that it was a grind.\r\nFor most, there were those tough courses at Tech. And a job, for money,\r\nfor sustenance. And the time that must be spent working for--Destiny.\r\nSleep was least important--a few hours, long after midnight, usually.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen figured that he had it relatively easy--almost as easy as\r\nthe Kuzak twins, who, during football season, were under strict orders\r\nto get their proper sack time. He worked at Hendricks'--old Paul didn't\r\nmind his combining the job with his labors of aspiration. Ramos, the\r\nnight-mechanic, Tiflin, the car-washer, and Two-and-Two Baines, the\r\npart-time bricklayer, didn't have it so easy. Eileen, a first-rate legal\r\ntypist employed for several hours a day by a partnership of lawyers,\r\ncould usually work from notes, at the place where she lived.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two would lift a big hand facetiously, when he came into the\r\nshop. Blinking and squinting, he would wiggle his fingers. \"I can still\r\nsee 'em--to count!\" he would moan. \"Thanks, all you good people, for\r\ncoaching me in my math.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" Charlie Reynolds or David Lester, or most any of\r\nthe others, would tell him. Two-and-Two hadn't come near Frank Nelsen\r\nvery much, during the last few days, though Frank had tried to be\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nLester was the only one without an activity to support himself. But he\r\nwas at the shop every weekday, six to ten p.m., cementing stellene with\r\nmeticulous care, while he muttered and dreamed.\r\n\r\nThe Bunch griped about courses, jobs, and the stubbornness of materials,\r\nbut they made progress. They had built their first bubb and ionic. The\r\nothers would be easier.\r\n\r\nEarly in November, Nelsen collected all available fresh capital,\r\nincluding a second thousand from Paul Hendricks and five hundred from\r\nCharlie Reynolds, and sent it in with new orders.\r\n\r\nThat about exhausted their own finances for a long time to come. Seven\r\nbubbs, minus most of even their simpler fittings, and five ionics,\r\nseemed as much as they could pay for, themselves. Charlie Reynolds\r\nhadn't yet lined up a backer.\r\n\r\n\"We should have planned to outfit one guy completely,\" Jig Hollins\r\ngrumbled on a Sunday afternoon at the shop. \"Then we could have drawn\r\nlots about who gets a chance to use the gear. That we goofed there is\r\nyour fault, Reynolds. Or--your Grandpappy didn't come through, huh?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie met Hollins' sneering gaze for a moment. \"Never mind the\r\n'Grandpappy', Jig,\" he said softly. \"I knew that chances weren't good,\r\nthere. However, there are other prospects which I'm working on. I\r\nremember mentioning that it might take time. As for your other remarks,\r\nwhat good is equipping just one person? I thought that this was a\r\nproject for all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm with Charlie,\" Joe Kuzak commented.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fight, guys--we've got to figure on training, too,\" Ramos\r\nlaughed. \"I've got the problem of an expensive training centrifuge about\r\nbeat. Out at my old motor scooter club. Come on, Charlie--you, too,\r\nJig--get your cars and let's go! It's only seven miles, and we all need\r\na break.\"\r\n\r\nPaul Hendricks had gone for a walk. So Nelsen locked the shop, and they\r\nall tore off, out to the place, Ramos leading the way in his scooter. At\r\nthe scooter club they found an ancient carnival device which used to be\r\ncalled a motordrome. It was a vertical wooden cylinder, like a huge,\r\nironbound, straight sided cask, thirty feet high and wide, standing on\r\nits bottom.\r\n\r\nRamos let himself and the scooter through a massive, curved\r\ndoor--conforming to the curvature of the walls--at the base of the\r\n'drome.\r\n\r\n\"Secure the latch bar of this door from the outside, fellas,\" he said.\r\n\"Then go to the gallery around the top to watch.\"\r\n\r\nRamos started riding his scooter in a tight circle around the bottom of\r\nthe 'drome. Increasing speed, he swung outward to the ramped juncture\r\nbetween floor and smooth, circular walls. Then, moving still faster, he\r\nwas riding around the vertical walls, themselves, held there by\r\ncentrifugal force. He climbed his vehicle to the very rim of the great\r\ncask, body out sideways, grinning and balancing, hands free, the\r\nsquirrel tails flapping from his gaudily repainted old scooter.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you characters!\" he shouted through the noise and smoke. \"You\r\nshould try this, too! It's good practice for the rough stuff to come,\r\nwhen we blast out!... Hey, Eileen--you try it first--ride with me--then\r\nalone--when you get the hang of it!...\"\r\n\r\nThis time she accepted. Soon she was riding by herself, smiling\r\nrecklessly. Reynolds rode after that, then the Kuzaks. Like most of\r\nthem, Frank Nelsen took the scooter up alone, from the start. He was a\r\nbit scared at first, but if you couldn't do a relatively simple stunt\r\nlike this, how could you get along in space? He became surer, then\r\ngleeful, even when the centrifugal force made his head giddy, pushed his\r\nbuttocks hard against the scooter's seat, and his insides down against\r\nhis pelvis.\r\n\r\nStorey, Hollins and Tiflin all accomplished it. Even Gimp Hines rode\r\nbehind Ramos in some very wild gyrations, though he didn't attempt to\r\nguide the scooter, himself.\r\n\r\nThen it was David Lester's turn. It was a foregone conclusion that he\r\ncouldn't take the scooter up, alone. Palefaced, he rode double. Ramos\r\nwas careful this time. But on the downward curve before coming to rest,\r\nthe change of direction made Lester grab Ramos' arm at a critical\r\ninstant. The scooter wavered, and they landed hard, even at reduced\r\nspeed. Agile Ramos skipped clear, landing on his feet. Lester flopped\r\nheavily, and skidded across the bottom of the 'drome.\r\n\r\nWhen the guys got to him, he was covered with friction burns, and with\r\nblood from a scalp gash. Ramos, Storey and Frank worked on him to get\r\nhim cleaned up and patched up. Part of the time he was sobbing bitterly,\r\nmore from failure, it seemed, than from his physical hurt. By luck there\r\ndidn't seem to be any bones broken.\r\n\r\n\"Darn!\" he choked in some infinite protest, beating the ground with his\r\nfists. \"Damn--that's the end of it for me...! So soon... Pop...\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drive you to Doc Miller's, Les,\" Charlie Reynolds said briskly.\r\n\"Then home. You other people better stay here...\"\r\n\r\nCharlie had a baffled, subdued look, when he returned an hour later. \"I\r\nthought his mother would chew my ear, sure,\" he said. \"She didn't. She\r\nwas just polite. That was worse. She's small--not much color. Of course\r\nshe was scared, and mad clean through. Know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we've all seen her around,\" Nelsen answered. \"Widow. Les was in\r\none of my classes during my first high school year. He was a senior,\r\nthen. They haven't been in Jarviston more than a few years. I never\r\nheard where they came from...\"\r\n\r\nWarily, back at the shop, the Bunch told Paul what had happened.\r\n\r\nFor once his pale eyes flashed. \"You Bright Boys,\" he said. \"Especially\r\nyou, Ramos...! Well, I'm most to blame. I let him hang around, because\r\nhe was so doggone interested. And _driven_--somehow. Lucky nothing too\r\nbad happened. Last August, when you romantics got serious about space, I\r\nmade him prove he was over twenty-one...\"\r\n\r\nThey sweated it out, expecting ear-burning phone calls, maybe legal\r\nsuits. Nothing happened. Nelsen felt relieved that Lester was gone. One\r\ndangerous link in a chain was removed. Contempt boosted his own arrogant\r\npride of accomplishment. Then pity came, and anger for the sneers of Jig\r\nHollins. Then regret for a fallen associate.\r\n\r\nThe dozen Archers were delivered--there would be a spare, now. The Bunch\r\ncontinued building equipment, they worked out in the motordrome, they\r\ndrilled at donning their armor and at inflating and rigging a bubb. Gimp\r\nHines exercised with fierce, perspiring doggedness on a horizontal bar\r\nhe had rigged in the back of the shop. He meant to compensate for his\r\nbad leg by improving his shoulder muscles.\r\n\r\nMost of the guys still figured that Charlie Reynolds would solve their\r\nmoney problem. But in late November he had a bad moment. Out in front of\r\nHendricks', he looked at his trim automobile. \"It's a cinch I can't use\r\nit Out There,\" he chuckled ruefully and unprompted. Then he brightened.\r\n\"Nope--selling it wouldn't bring one tenth enough, anyhow. I'll get what\r\nwe need--just got to keep trying... I don't know why, but some so-called\r\nexperts are saying that off-the-Earth enterprises have been\r\noverextended. That makes finding a backer a bit tougher than I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to just take off on your own, Reynolds,\" Jig Hollins\r\nsuggested airily. \"I'll bet it's in your mind. The car would pay for\r\nthat. Or since you're a full-fledged nuclear engineer, some company on\r\nthe Moon might give you a three year contract and send you out free in a\r\ncomfortable vehicle. Or wouldn't you like to be tied that long? I\r\nwouldn't. Maybe I could afford to be an independent, too. Tough on these\r\nshoestring boys, here, but is it _our_ fault?\"\r\n\r\nHollins was trying to taunt Reynolds. \"You're tiresome, Jig,\" Reynolds\r\nsaid without heat. \"Somebody's going to poke you sometime...\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, before going to classes at Tech, Frank Nelsen, with the\r\npossibility of bitter disappointment looming in his own mind, spotted\r\nGlen Tiflin, the switch blade tosser, standing on the corner, not quite\r\nopposite the First National Bank. Tiflin's mouth was tight and his eyes\r\nwere narrowed.\r\n\r\nNelsen felt a tingle in his nerves--very cold.\r\n\r\n\"Hi--what cooks, Tif?\" he said mildly.\r\n\r\n\"To you it's which?\" Tiflin snapped.\r\n\r\nNelson led him on. \"Sometimes I think of all the dough in that bank,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tiflin snarled softly. \"That old coot, Charlie Reynolds'\r\ngrandpa, sitting by his vault door. Too obvious, though--here. Maybe in\r\nanother bank--in another town. We could get the cash we need. Hell,\r\nthough--be cavalier--it's just a thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You damned fool!\" Nelsen hissed slowly.\r\n\r\nIt was harder than ever to like Tiflin for anything at all. But he did\r\nhave that terrible, star-reaching desperation. Nelsen had quite a bit of\r\nit, himself. He knew, now.\r\n\r\n\"Get up to Tech, Tif,\" he said like an order. \"If you have a chance,\r\ntell my math prof I might be a little late...\"\r\n\r\nThat was how Frank Nelsen happened to face J. John Reynolds, who, in a\r\nquestion of progress, would still approve of galley slaves. Nelsen had\r\nheard jokes like that laughed about, around Jarviston. J. John, by\r\nreputation, was all hard business.\r\n\r\nNelsen got past his secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Young man--I hope you have something very special to say.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a cold, amused challenge in the old man's tone, and an\r\nimplication of a moment of casual audience granted generously, amid\r\nmountains of more important affairs.\r\n\r\nNelsen didn't waver. The impulse to do what he was doing had come too\r\nsuddenly for nervousness to build up. He hadn't planned what to say, but\r\nhis arguments were part of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Reynolds--I'm Frank Nelsen, born here in Jarviston. Perhaps you\r\nknow me on sight. I believe you are acquainted with Paul Hendricks, and\r\nyou must have heard about our group, which is aiming at space, as people\r\nlike ourselves are apt to be doing, these days. We've made fair\r\nprogress, which proves we're at least earnest, if not dedicated. But\r\nunless we wait and save for years, we've come about as far as we can,\r\nwithout a loan. Judging from the success of previous earnest groups, and\r\nthe development of resources and industries beyond the Earth, we are\r\nsure that we could soon pay you back, with considerable interest.\"\r\n\r\nJ. John Reynolds seemed to doze, hardly listening. But at the end his\r\neyes opened, and sparks of anger--or acid humor--seemed to dance in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I know very well what sort of poetic tomfoolery you are talking about,\r\nNelsen,\" he said. \"I wondered how long it would be before one of\r\nyou--other than my grandson with his undiluted brass, and knowing me far\r\ntoo well in one sense, anyway--would have the gall to come here and talk\r\nto me like this. You'd probably be considered a minor, too, in some\r\nstates. Dealing with you, I could even get into trouble.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen's mouth tightened. \"I came to make a proposition and get an\r\nanswer,\" he responded. \"Thank you for your no. It helps clear the view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, Nelsen,\" J. John growled. \"I don't remember saying no. I said\r\n'gall,' intending it to mean guts. That's what young spacemen need,\r\nisn't it? They've almost got to be _young_, so legal viewpoints about\r\nthe age at which competence is reached are changing. Oh, there is plenty\r\nof brass among your generation. But it fails in peculiar places. I was\r\nwaiting for one place where it didn't fail. Charlie, my grandson,\r\ndoesn't count. It has never taken him any courage to talk to me any way\r\nhe wants.\"\r\n\r\nThis whole encounter was still dreamlike to Frank Nelsen.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are saying yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might. Do you foolishly imagine that my soul is so completely sour\r\nmilk that in youth I couldn't feel the same drives that you feel, now,\r\nfor the limited opportunity there was, then? But under some damnable\r\npressure toward conformity, I took a desk job in a bank. I am now\r\neighty-one years old... How much does your 'Bunch' need--at minimum,\r\nmind you--for the opportunity to ride in space-armor till the rank smell\r\nof their bodies almost chokes them, for developing weird allergies or\r\ngoing murdering mad, but, in the main, doing their best, anyway,\r\npathfinding and building, if they've got the guts? Come on, Nelsen--you\r\nmust know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty thousand,\" Frank answered quickly. \"There are still eleven in our\r\ngroup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes... More may quit along the way... Here is _my_ proposition: I would\r\nmake funds available for your expenses up to that amount--from my\r\npersonal holdings, separate from this bank. The amount due from each\r\nindividual shall be ten percent of whatever his gains or earnings are,\r\noff the Earth, over a period of ten years, but he will not be required\r\nto pay back any part of the original loan. This is a high-risk,\r\nhigh-potential profit arrangement for me--with an experimental element.\r\nI will ask for no written contract--only a verbal promise. I have found\r\nthat people are fairly honest, and I know that, far in space,\r\ncircumstances become too complicated to make legal collections very\r\npractical, anyway, even if I ever felt inclined to try them... Now,\r\nif--after I see your friends, whom you will send to me for an interview\r\nand to give me their individual word, also, I decide to make my\r\nproposition effective--will you, yourself, promise to abide by these\r\nterms?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen was wary for a second. \"Yes--I promise,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good. I am glad you paused to think, Nelsen. I am not fabulously rich.\r\nBut having more or less money hardly matters to me at this late date, so\r\nI am not likely to try to trap you. Yet there is still a game to play,\r\nand an outcome to watch--the future. Now get out of here before you\r\nbecome ridiculous by saying more than a casual thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right--thanks. Thank you, sir...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen felt somewhat numb. But a faint, golden glow was increasing\r\ninside his mind.\r\n\r\nTiflin hadn't gone up to Tech. He was still waiting on the street\r\ncorner. \"What the hell, Frank?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I think we've got the loan, Tif. But he wants to see all of us. Can you\r\ngo in there, be polite, say you're a Bunch member, make a promise,\r\nand--above all--avoid blowing your top? Boy--if you queer this...!\"\r\n\r\nTiflin's mouth was open. \"You kidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nTiflin gulped, and actually looked subdued. \"Okay, Frank. Be cavalier.\r\nHell, I'd croak before I'd mess this up...!\"\r\n\r\nBy evening, everybody had visited J. John Reynolds, including Charlie\r\nReynolds and Jig Hollins. Nelsen got the backslapping treatment.\r\n\r\nCharlie sighed, rubbed his head, then grinned with immense relief.\r\n\"That's a load off,\" he said. \"Glad to have somebody else fix it.\r\nCongrats, Frank. I wonder if Otto has got any champagne to go with the\r\nhotdogs...?\"\r\n\r\nOtto had a bottle--enough for a taste, all around. Eileen kissed Frank\r\nimpulsively. \"You ought to get _real_ smart,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" he answered. \"Now let's get some beer--more our speed.\"\r\n\r\nBut none of them overdid the beer either...\r\n\r\nJust after New Year's they had eight bubbs completed, tested, folded\r\ncarefully according to government manuals, and stowed in an attic they\r\nhad rented over Otto's place. They had seven ionics finished and stored.\r\nMore parts and materials were arriving. The air-restorers were going to\r\nbe the toughest and most expensive to make. They were the really vital\r\nthings to a spaceman. Every detail had to be carefully fitted and\r\nassembled. The chlorophane contained costly catalytic agents.\r\n\r\nA winter of hard work was ahead, but they figured on a stretch of clear\r\nsailing, now. They didn't expect anyone to shake their morale, least of\r\nall a nice, soft-spoken guy in U.S.S.F. greys. Harv Diamond was the one\r\nman from Jarviston who had gotten into the Space Force. He used to hang\r\naround Hendricks'.\r\n\r\nHe dropped in on a Sunday evening, when the whole Bunch was in the shop.\r\nThey were around him at once, like around a hero, shouting and\r\nquestioning. There were mottled patches on his hands, and he wore dark\r\nglasses, but he seemed at ease and happy.\r\n\r\n\"There have been some changes in the old joint, huh, Paul?\" he said. \"So\r\nyou guys are one of the outfits building its own gear... Looks pretty\r\ngood... Of course you can get some bulky supplies cheaper on the Moon,\r\nbecause everything from Earth has to be boosted into space against a\r\ngravity six times as great as the lunar, which raises the price like\r\nhell. Water and oxygen, for instance. Peculiar, on the dry, almost\r\nairless Moon. But roasting water out of lunar gypsum rock is an easy\r\ntrick. And oxygen can be derived from water by simple electrolysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, we know all that, Harv,\" Ramos laughed.\r\n\r\nSo Harv Diamond gave them the lowdown on the shortage of girls--yet--in\r\nSerenitatis Base, on the Moon. Just the same, it was growing like corn\r\nin July, and was already a pretty good leave-spot, if you liked to look\r\naround. Big vegetable gardens under sealed, stellene domes. Metal\r\nrefineries, solar power plants, plastic factories and so forth, already\r\nin operation... But there was nothing like Pallastown, on little Pallas,\r\nout in the Asteroid Belt... Mars? That was the heebie-jeebie planet.\r\n\r\nGimp asked Harv how much leave he had on Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Not long, I guess,\" Harv laughed. \"I've got to check back at the Force\r\nHospital in Minneapolis tomorrow...\"\r\n\r\nBut right away it was evident that his thoughts had been put on the\r\nwrong track. His easy smile faded. He gasped and looked kind of\r\nsurprised. He hung onto Paul's old swivel chair, in which he was\r\nsitting, as if he was suddenly terribly afraid of falling. His eyes\r\nclosed tight, and there was a funny gurgle in his throat.\r\n\r\nThe Bunch surrounded him, wanting to help, but he half recovered.\r\n\r\n\"Even a good Space Force bubb, manufactured under rigid government\r\nspecifications, can tear,\" he said in a thick tone. \"If some jerk,\r\nhorsing around with another craft, bumps you even lightly.\r\nCompartmentation helps, but you can still be unlucky. I was\r\nfortunate--almost buttoned into my Archer Six, already. _But did you\r\never see a person slowly swell up and turn purple, with frothy bubbles\r\nforming under the skin, while his blood boils in the Big Vacuum?_ That\r\nwas my buddy, Ed Kraft...\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Harvey Diamond gasped. Huge, strangling hiccups came out of\r\nhis throat. His eyes went wild. The Kuzaks had to hold him, while Mitch\r\nStorey ran to phone Doc Miller. A shot quieted Diamond somewhat, and an\r\nambulance took him away.\r\n\r\nThat incident shook up the Bunch a little. A worse one came on a Tuesday\r\nevening, when not everybody was at the shop.\r\n\r\nThe TV was on, showing the interior of the _Far Side_, one of those big,\r\ncomparatively luxurious tour bubbs that take rubbernecks that can afford\r\nit on a swing around the Moon. The _Far Side_ was just coming into\r\norbit, where tending skip gliders would take off the passengers for\r\ngrounding at the New Mexico spaceport. Aboard the big bubb you could see\r\npeople moving about, or sitting with drinks on curved benches. A girl\r\nwas playing soft music on a tiny, lightweight piano.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't any sign of trouble except that the TV channel went dead\r\nfor a second, until a stand by commercial with singing cartoon figures\r\ncut in.\r\n\r\nBut Frank Nelsen somehow put his hands to his head, as if to protect it.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey, with a big piece of stellene in his brown mitts, stood up\r\nvery straight.\r\n\r\nGimp, at a bench, handed a tiny capacitor to Eileen, and started\r\ncounting, slow and even. \"One--two--three--four--five--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's with you slobs?\" Jig Hollins wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno--we're nuts, maybe,\" Gimp answered. \"Ten--eleven--twelve--\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Reynolds and Paul Hendricks were alert, too.\r\n\r\nThen a big, white light trembled on the thin snow beyond the windows,\r\nturning the whole night landscape into weird day. The tearing, crackling\r\nroar was delayed. By the time the sound arrived, all of the stellene in\r\nthe _Far Side_ must have been consumed. It had no resistance to\r\natmospheric friction at five miles per second, or faster. There were\r\njust the heavier metallic details left to fall and burn. Far off, there\r\nwas a thumping crash that seemed to make the ground sag and recover.\r\n\r\n\"Here we go!\" Charlie Reynolds yelled.\r\n\r\nIn his and Hollins' cars, they got to the scene of the fragment's fall,\r\ntwo miles out of town, by following a faint, fading glow. They were\r\nalmost the first to reach the spot. Tiflin and Ramos, who had been\r\nworking on their jobs, came with their boss, along with a trailing horde\r\nof cars from town.\r\n\r\nFlashlights probed into the hot impact pit in the open field, where the\r\nfrozen soil had seemed to splash like a liquid. Crumpled in the hole was\r\na lump of half-fused sheet steel, wadded up like paper. It was probably\r\npart of the _Far Side_'s central hub. Magnesium and aluminum, of which\r\nthe major portions had certainly been made, were gone; they could never\r\nhave endured the rush through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nRamos got down into the pit. After a minute, he gave a queer cry, and\r\nclimbed out again. His mitten smoked as he opened it, to show something.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been behind a heavy object,\" he said very seriously, not\r\nlike his usual self at all. \"That broke the molecular impact with the\r\nair--like a ceramic nose cone. Kept it from burning up completely.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing was a lady's silver compact, from which a large piece had been\r\nfused away. A bobbypin had gotten welded to it.\r\n\r\nOld Paul Hendricks cursed. Poor Two-and-Two moved off sickly, with a\r\npalm clamped over his mouth.\r\n\r\nEileen Sands gasped, and seemed about to yell. But she got back most of\r\nher poise. Women have nursed the messily ill and dying, and have tended\r\nghastly wounds during ages of time. So they know the messier side of\r\nbiology as well as men.\r\n\r\nRamos gave the pathetic relic to a cop who was trying to take charge.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody must have goofed bad on the _Far Side_, for it to miss orbit\r\nlike that,\" Ramos grated. \"Or was something wrong, beforehand? Their TV\r\ntransmitter went out--we were watching, too, at the garage... You can\r\nsee the aurora--the Northern Lights... Those damn solar storms might\r\nhave loused up instruments...! But who'll ever know, now...?\"\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks, who had been to an Athletic Association meeting at Tech, had\r\ngrabbed a ride out with the stream of cars from town. Both looked grim.\r\n\"No use hanging around here, Charlie,\" Art urged. \"Let's get back to the\r\nshop.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he drove off, Jig Hollins tried to chuckle mockingly at\r\neverybody, especially Charlie Reynolds. \"Time to think about keeping a\r\nnice safe job in the Jarviston powerhouse--eh, Reynolds? And staying\r\nnear granddad?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're supposed not to be children, Hollins,\" Charlie shot back at him\r\nfrom his car window. \"We're supposed to have known long ago that these\r\nthings happen, and to have adjusted ourselves to our chances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ninnies that get scared first thing, when the facts begin to show!\"\r\nTiflin snarled. \"Cripes--let's don't be like soft bugs under boards!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Tif,\" Frank Nelsen agreed, feeling that for once the\r\nne'er-do-well--the nuisance--might be doing them all some good. Frank\r\ncould feel how Tiflin shamed some of the quiver out of his own insides,\r\nand helped bring back pride and strength.\r\n\r\nThe _Far Side_ disaster had been pretty disturbing, however. And next\r\nday, Thursday, the blue envelopes came to the members of the Bunch. A\r\nprinted card with a typed-in date, was inside each: \"Report for\r\nspace-fitness tests at Space-Medicine Center, February 15th...\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a couple of weeks!\" Two-and-Two was moaning that night. \"How'll I\r\nget through, with my courses only half-finished. You've gotta help me\r\nsome more, people! With that stinking math...!\"\r\n\r\nSo equipment building was almost suspended, while the Bunch crammed and\r\nsweated and griped and cursed. But maybe now some of them wouldn't care\r\nso very much if they flunked.\r\n\r\nTwo loaded automobiles took off for Minneapolis on the night before the\r\nordeal. The Bunch put up at motels to be fresh the next morning. Maybe\r\nsome of them even slept.\r\n\r\nAt the Center, there were more forms to fill out. Then complete\r\nphysicals started the process. Next came the written part. Right off,\r\nFrank Nelsen knew that this was going a familiar way, which had\r\nhappened quite often at Tech: Struggle through a tough course, hear dire\r\npromises of head-cracking questions and math problems in the final quiz.\r\nThen the switch--the easy letdown.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the tests proceeded like assembly-line operations, each\r\nperson taking each alone, in the order of his casual position in the\r\nwaiting line.\r\n\r\nFirst there was the dizzying, mind-blackening centrifuge test, to see if\r\nyou could take enough Gs of acceleration, and still be alert enough to\r\nfit a simple block puzzle together.\r\n\r\nThen came the free fall test, from the top of a thousand foot tower. A\r\nparachute-arrangement broke your speed at the bottom of the track. As in\r\nthe centrifuge, instruments incorporated into the fabric of a coverall\r\nsuit with a hood, were recording your emotional and bodily reactions.\r\nThe medics wanted to be sure that your panic level was high and cool.\r\nNelsen didn't find free fall very hard to take, either.\r\n\r\nRight after that came the scramble to see how fast you could get into an\r\nArcher, unfold and inflate a bubb and rig its gear.\r\n\r\n\"That's all, Mister,\" the observer with the camera told Nelsen in a\r\nbored tone.\r\n\r\n\"Results will be mailed to your home within twelve hours--Mr. Nelsen,\" a\r\ngirl informed him as she read his name from a printed card.\r\n\r\nSo the Bunch returned tensely to Jarviston, with more time to sweat out.\r\nEverybody looked at Gimp Hines--and then looked away. Even Jig Hollins\r\ndidn't make any comments. Gimp, himself, seemed pretty subdued.\r\n\r\nThe small, green space-fitness cards were arriving at Jarviston\r\naddresses in the morning.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the noon hour, Two-and-Two Baines was waving his around\r\nthe Tech campus, having gone home to look, as of course everybody else\r\nwho could, had also done. \"Cripes!--Hi-di-ho--here it is!\" he was\r\nyelling at the frosty sky, when Frank came with his own ticket.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks had theirs, and were calm about it. Eileen Sands' card was\r\ntucked neatly into her sweater pocket, as she joined those who were\r\nwaiting for the others on the front steps of Tech's Carver Hall.\r\n\r\nRamos had to make a noise. \"See what Santa brought the lady! But he\r\ndidn't forget your Uncle Miguel, either--see! We're in, kid--be happy.\r\nYippee!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to whirl her in some crazy dance, but Gimp was swinging along\r\nthe slushy walk on his crutches. His grin was a mile wide. Mitch Storey\r\nwas with him, looking almost as pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Guess legs don't count, Out There,\" Gimp was saying. \"Or patched\r\ntickers, either, as long as they work good! I kind of figured on it...\r\nHey--I don't want to ride anybody's shoulders, Ramos--cut it out...! We\r\nwon't know about Charlie and Jig till tonight, when they come to Paul's\r\nfrom their jobs. But I don't think that there's any sweat for them,\r\neither... Only--where's Tif? He should be back by now from where he\r\nlives with his father...\"\r\n\r\nTiflin didn't show up at Hendricks' at all that evening, or at his\r\ngarage job either. Ramos phoned from the garage to confirm that.\r\n\r\n\"And he's not at home,\" Ramos added. \"The boss sent me to check. His Old\r\nMan says he doesn't know where Tif is and cares less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just leave Tif be,\" Mitch Storey said softly.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe that's best, at that,\" old Paul growled. \"Only I hope the darned\r\nidiot doesn't cook himself up another jam...\"\r\n\r\nThey all knew then, for sure, what had happened. Right now, Glen Tiflin\r\nwas wandering alone, somewhere, cursing and suffering. As likely as not,\r\nhe'd start hitchhiking across the country, to try to get away from\r\nhimself... Somewhere the test instruments--which had seemed so\r\nlenient--had tripped him up, spotting the weakness that he had tried to\r\nfight. Temper, nerves--emotional instability. So there was no green card\r\nfor Tif, to whom space was a kind of Nirvana...\r\n\r\nThe Bunch worked on with their preparations. Things got done all right,\r\nbut the fine edge of enthusiasm had dulled. Jig Hollins flung his usual\r\nremarks, with their derisive undertone, around for a couple of weeks.\r\nThen he came into the shop with a girl who had a pretty, rather blank\r\nface, and a mouth that could twist with stubborn anger.\r\n\r\n\"Meet Minnie,\" Jig said loudly. \"She is one reason why I have decided\r\nthat I've had enough of this kid stuff. I gave it a whirl--for kicks.\r\nBut who, with any sense, wants to go batting off to Mars or the\r\nAsteroids? That's for the birds, the crackpots. Wife, house, kids--right\r\nin your own home town--that's the only sense there is. Minnie showed me\r\nthat, and we're gonna get married!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bunch looked at Jig Hollins. He was swaggering. He was making sour\r\nfun of them, but in his eyes there were other signs, too. A pleading:\r\nAgree with me--back me up--quit! Don't see through me--it's not so,\r\nanyhow! Don't say I'm hiding behind a skirt... Above all, don't call me\r\nyellow! I'm _not_ yellow, I tell you! I'm tough Jig Hollins! You're the\r\ndopes!...\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen spoke for the others. \"We understand, Jig. We'll be getting\r\nyou a little wedding present. Later on, maybe we'll be able to send you\r\nsomething really good. Best of luck...\"\r\n\r\nThey let Jig Hollins and his Minnie go. They felt their contempt and\r\npity, and their lifting, wild pride. Maybe Jig Hollins, wise guy and big\r\nmouth, boosted their own selves quite a bit, by contrast.\r\n\r\n\"Poor sap,\" Joe Kuzak breathed. \"Who's he kidding--us or himself, or\r\nneither...?\"\r\n\r\nSoon Eileen began to show symptoms: Sighs. A restlessness. Sudden angry\r\npouts that would change as quickly to the secret smiles of reverie,\r\nwhile she hummed a soft tune to herself, and rose on her toes, dancing a\r\nfew steps. Speculative looks at Nelsen, or the other guys around her.\r\nMaybe she envied men. Her eyes would narrow thoughtfully for a second.\r\nThen she might look scared and very young, as if her thoughts frightened\r\nher. But the expression of determined planning would return.\r\n\r\nAfter about ten days of this, Gimp asked, \"What's with you, Eileen? You\r\ndon't usually say much, but now there must be something else.\"\r\n\r\nShe tossed down a fistful of waste with which she had been wiping her\r\nhands--she had been cementing segments of the last of the ten bubbs they\r\nwould make--more than they needed, now, but spares might be useful.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, all,\" she said briskly. \"You should hear this, without any\r\nfurther delay. I'm clearing out, too. Reasons? Well--at least since Tif\r\nflunked his emotional I've been getting the idea that possibly I've been\r\nplaying on a third-rate team. No offense, please--I don't really believe\r\nit's so, and if it isn't so you're tough enough not to be hurt. Far\r\nworse--I'm a girl. So why am I trying to do things in a man's way, when\r\nthere are means that are made for me? I'm all of twenty-two. I've got\r\nnobody except an aunt in Illinois. Meanwhile, out in New Mexico, there's\r\na big spaceport, and a lot of the right people who can help me. I'll bet\r\nI can get where you want to go, before you do. Tell Mr. J. John Reynolds\r\nthat he can have my equipment--most of which he paid for. But perhaps\r\nI'll still be able to give him his ten percent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eileen! Cripes, what are you talking about?\" This was Ramos yelping, as\r\nif the clown could be hurt, after all.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean anything so bad, Fun Boy,\" she said more gently. \"Lots of\r\nmen are remarkably chivalrous. But no arguments. Now that I have\r\ndeclared my intentions, I'll pick up and pull out of here this\r\nminute--taking some pleasant memories with me, as well as a\r\nspace-fitness card. You're all good, plodding joes--honest. But there'll\r\nbe a plane west from Minneapolis tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe was getting into her blazer. Even Ramos saw that arguments would be\r\nfutile. Frank Nelsen's throat ached suddenly, as if at sins of omission.\r\nBut that was wrong. Eileen Sands was too old for him, anyhow.\r\n\r\n\"So long, you characters,\" she said. \"Good luck. Don't follow me\r\noutside. Maybe I'll see you, someplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, Eileen--we'll miss yuh,\" Storey said. \"And we better sure enough\r\nsee you that someplace!\"\r\n\r\nThere were ragged shouts. \"Good luck, kid. So long, Eileen...\"\r\n\r\nShe was gone--a small, scared, determined figure, dressed like a boy. On\r\nher wrist was a watch that might get pawned for a plane ticket.\r\n\r\nRamos was unbelievably glum for days. But he worked harder building\r\nair-restorers than most of the Bunch had ever worked before. \"We're\r\nhardcore, now--we'll last,\" he would growl. \"Final, long lap--March,\r\nApril and May--with no more interruptions. In June, when our courses at\r\nTech are finished, we'll be ready to roll...\"\r\n\r\nThat was about how it turned out. Near the end of May, the Bunch lined\r\nup in the shop, the ten blastoff drums they had made, including two\r\nspares. The drums were just large tubes of sheet magnesium, in which\r\nabout everything that each man would need was compactly stowed: Archer\r\nFive, bubb, sun-powered ionic drive motor, air-restorer,\r\nmoisture-reclaimer, flasks of oxygen and water, instruments, dehydrated\r\nfoods, medicines, a rifle, instruction manuals, a few clothes, and\r\nvarious small, useful items. Everything was cut to minimum, to keep the\r\nweight down. The lined up drums made a utilitarian display that looked\r\nrather grim.\r\n\r\nThe gear was set out like this, for the safety inspectors to look at\r\nduring the next few days, and provide their stamp of approval.\r\n\r\nThe blastoff tickets had also been purchased--for June tenth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how do you think the Bunch should travel to New Mexico, Paul?\"\r\nFrank Nelsen joshed.\r\n\r\n\"Like other Bunches, I guess,\" Paul Hendricks laughed. \"A couple of\r\nmoving vans should do the trick...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June first, ten days before blastoff, David Lester came back to the\r\nshop, sheepishness, pleasure and worry showing in his face.\r\n\r\n\"I cleared up matters at home, guys,\" he said. \"And I went to\r\nMinneapolis and obtained one of these.\" He held up the same kind of\r\nspace-fitness card that the others had.\r\n\r\n\"The tests are mostly passive,\" he explained further. \"Anybody can be\r\nwhirled in a centrifuge, or take a fall. That is somewhat simpler, in\r\nits own way, than clinging to a careening motor scooter. Though I do\r\nadmit that I was still almost rejected...! So, I'll join you, again--if\r\nI'm permitted? I understand that my old gear has been completed, as a\r\nspare? Paul told me. Of course I'm being crusty, in asking to have it\r\nback, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-uh, Les--I'm sure that's okay,\" Ramos grunted. \"Right, fellas?\"\r\n\r\nThe others nodded.\r\n\r\nA subdued cheerfulness seemed to possess Lester, the mamma's boy, as if\r\nhe had eased and become less introverted. The Bunch took him back\r\nreadily enough, though with misgivings. Still, the mere fact that a\r\ncompanion could return, after defeat, helped brace their uncertain\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\n\"I'll order you a blastoff ticket, Les,\" Frank Nelsen said. \"In one of\r\nthe two GOs--ground-to-orbit rockets--reserved for us. The space is\r\nstill there...\"\r\n\r\nDavid Lester had won a battle. He meant to win through, completely.\r\nPerhaps some of this determination was transmitted to the others.\r\nTwo-and-Two Baines, for example, seemed more composed.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much work to do during those last days, after the equipment\r\nhad been inspected and approved, the initials of each man painted in red\r\non his blastoff drum, and all the necessary documents put in order.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey rode a bus to Mississippi, to say goodbye to his folks. The\r\nKuzaks flew to Pennsylvania for the same reason. Likewise, Gimp Hines\r\nwent by train to Illinois. Ramos rode his scooter all the way down to\r\nEast Texas and back, to see his parents and a flock of younger brothers\r\nand sisters. When he returned, he solemnly gave his well-worn vehicle\r\nto an earnest boy still in high school.\r\n\r\n\"No dough,\" Ramos said. \"I just want her to have a good home.\"\r\n\r\nThose of the Bunch who had families didn't run into any serious last\r\nminute objections from them about their going into space. Blasting out\r\nwas getting to be an accepted destiny.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of trouble with Two-and-Two Baines about a kid of\r\neight years named Chippie Potter, who had begun to hang around\r\nHendricks' just the way Frank Nelsen had done, long ago. But more\r\nespecially, the trouble was about Chippie's fox terrier, Blaster.\r\n\r\n\"The lad of course can't go along with us, Out There, on account of\r\nschool and his Mom,\" Two-and-Two said sentimentally, on one of those\r\nfinal evenings. \"So he figures his mutt should go in his place. Shucks,\r\nmaybe he's right! A lady mutt first made it into orbit, ahead of any\r\npeople, remember? And we ought to have a mascot. We could make a sealed\r\nair-conditioned box and smuggle old Blaster. Afterwards, he'd be all\r\nright, inside a bubb.\"\r\n\r\n\"You try any stunt like that and I'll shoot you,\" Frank Nelsen promised.\r\n\"Things are going to be complicated enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You always tell me no, Frank,\" Two-and-Two mourned.\r\n\r\n\"I know something else,\" said Joe Kuzak--he and his tough twin had\r\nreturned to Jarviston by then, as had all the others who had visited\r\ntheir homes. \"There's a desperate individual around, again. Tiflin. He\r\nappealed his test--and lost. Kind of a good guy--someways...\"\r\n\r\nThe big Kuzaks, usually easy and steady and not too comical, both had a\r\ncertain kind of expression, now--like amused and secretive gorillas.\r\nFrank wasn't sure whether he got the meaning of this or not, but right\r\nthen he felt sort of sympathetic to Tiflin, too.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hear anything; I won't say or do anything,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, under the pressure of events, he forgot the whole matter.\r\n\r\nIt would take about thirty-six hours to get to the New Mexico spaceport.\r\nCalculating accordingly, the Bunch hoisted their gear aboard two\r\ncanvas-covered trucks parked in the driveway beside Hendricks', just\r\nbefore sundown of their last day in Jarviston.\r\n\r\nPeople had begun to gather, to see them off. Two-and-Two's folks, a\r\nsolid, chunky couple, looking grave. David Lester's mother, of course,\r\nseeming younger than the Bunch remembered her. Make-up brought back some\r\nof her good-looks. She was more Spartan than they had thought, too.\r\n\r\n\"I have made up a basket of sandwiches for you and your comrades,\r\nLester,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOtto Kramer was out with free hotdogs, beer and Pepsi, his face sad. J.\r\nJohn Reynolds, backer of the Bunch, had promised to come down, later.\r\nChief of Police, Bill Hobard, was there, looking grim, as if he was half\r\nglad and half sorry to lose this passel of law-abiding but worrisome\r\nyoung eccentrics. There were various cynical and curious loafers around,\r\ntoo. There were Chippie Potter and his mutt--a more wistful and\r\nworshipping pair would have been hard to imagine.\r\n\r\nSophia Jameson, one of Charlie Reynolds' old flames, was there. Charlie\r\nhad sold his car and given away his wardrobe, but he still managed to\r\nlook good in a utilitarian white coverall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we had a lot of laughs, anyway, you big ape!\" Sophia was saying\r\nto Charlie, when Roy Harder, the mailman with broken-down feet, shuffled\r\nup, puffing.\r\n\r\n\"One for you, Reynolds,\" he said. \"Also one for you, Nelsen. They just\r\ncame--ordinarily I wouldn't deliver them till tomorrow morning. But you\r\nsee how it is.\"\r\n\r\nA long, white envelope was in Frank Nelsen's hands. In its upper\r\nleft-hand corner was engraved:\r\n\r\n                 UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE\r\n                 RECRUITING SECTION\r\n                 WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\n\"Jeez, Frankie--Charlie--you made it--open 'em, quick!\" Two-and-Two\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nFrank was about to do so. But everybody knew exactly what was inside\r\nsuch an envelope--the only thing that was ever so enclosed, unless you\r\nwere already in the Force. An official summons to report, on such and\r\nsuch a date and such and such a place, for examination.\r\n\r\nFor a minute Frank Nelsen suffered the awful anguish of indecision over\r\na joke of circumstance. Like most of the others, he had tried to get\r\ninto the Force. He had given it up as hopeless. Now, when he was ready\r\nto move out on his own, the chance came. Exquisite irony.\r\n\r\nFrank felt the lift of maybe being one of--well--the Chosen. To wear the\r\nred, black and silver rocket emblem, to use the finest equipment, to\r\ncarry out dangerous missions, to exercise authority in space, and yet to\r\nbe pampered, as those who make a mark in life are pampered.\r\n\r\n\"_Que milagro!_--holy cow!\" Ramos breathed.\r\n\"Charlie--Frankie--congratulations!\"\r\n\r\nFrank saw the awed faces around them. They were looking up to him and\r\nCharlie in a friendly way, but already he felt that he had kind of lost\r\nthem by being a little luckier. Or was this all goof ball sentiment in\r\nhis own mind, to make himself feel real modest?\r\n\r\nSo maybe he got sentimental about this impoverished, ragtag Bunch that,\r\neven considering J. John Reynolds' help, still were pulling themselves\r\nup into space almost literally by their own bootstraps. He had always\r\nbelonged to the Bunch, and he still did. So perhaps he just got sore.\r\n\r\nCharlie's and his eyes met for a second, in understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Postman Roy,\" Charlie said. \"Only you were right the first\r\ntime. These letters shouldn't be delivered until your next trip around,\r\ntomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nThey both handed the envelopes back to Roy Harder.\r\n\r\nThe voices of their Bunch-mates jangled in a conflicting chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--yuh damfools!\" Two-and-Two bleated.\r\n\r\n\"Good for them!\" Art Kuzak said, perhaps mockingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hey--they're us--they'll stay with us--shut up--didn't we lose enough\r\npeople, already?\" Gimp said.\r\n\r\nFrank grinned with half of his mouth. \"We always needed a name,\" he\r\nremarked. \"How about _The Planet Strappers_? Hell--if the chairborne\r\nechelon of the U.S.S.F. is so slow and picky, let 'em go sit on a\r\nsunspot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need some white paint and a brush, Paul,\" Ramos declared, running\r\ninto the shop.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of minutes more, the name for the Bunch was crudely and\r\nboldly lettered on the sides of both trucks.\r\n\r\n\"Salute your ladies, shake hands with your neighbors, and then let's get\r\nmoving,\" Charlie Reynolds laughed genially.\r\n\r\nAnd so they did. Old Paul Hendricks, born too soon, blinked a little as\r\nhe grinned, and slapped shoulders. \"On your way, you lucky tramps...!\"\r\n\r\nThere were quick movements here and there--a kiss, a touch of hands, a\r\nsmall gesture, a strained glance.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen blew a kiss jauntily to Nance Codiss, the neighbor girl,\r\nwho waved to him from the background. \"So long, Frank...\" He wondered if\r\nhe saw a fierce envy showing in her face.\r\n\r\nMiss Rosalie Parks, his high school Latin teacher, was there, too. Old\r\nJ. John Reynolds appeared at the final moment to smile dryly and to flap\r\na waxy hand.\r\n\r\n\"So long, sir... Thanks...\" they all shouted as the diesels of the\r\ntrucks whirred and then roared. J. John still had never been around the\r\nshop. It was only Frank who had seen him regularly, every week. It might\r\nhave been impertinent for them to say that they'd make him really rich.\r\nBut some must have hoped that they'd get rich, themselves.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen was perched on his neatly packed blastoff drum in the back\r\nof one of the trucks, as big tires began to turn. Near him, similarly\r\nperched, were Mitch Storey, dark and thoughtful, Gimp Hines with a\r\ntriumph in his face, Two-and-Two Baines biting his lip, and Dave Lester\r\nwith his large Adam's apple bobbing.\r\n\r\nSo that was how the Bunch left Jarviston, on a June evening that smelled\r\nof fresh-cut hay and car fumes--home. Perhaps they had chosen this hour\r\nto go because the gathering darkness might soften their haunting\r\nsuspicions of complete folly before an adventure so different from the\r\nlife they knew--neat streets, houses, beds, Saturday nights, dances,\r\nstruggling for a dream at Hendricks'--that even if they survived the\r\nchange, the difference must seem a little like death.\r\n\r\nSeeking the lifting thread of magical romance again, Frank Nelsen looked\r\nup at the ribbed canvas top of the truck. \"Covered wagon,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Sure--Indians--boom-boom,\" Two-and-Two chuckled, brightening. \"Wild\r\nWest... Yeah--_wild_--that's a word I kind of like.\"\r\n\r\nUp ahead, in the other truck, Ramos and Charlie Reynolds had begun to\r\nsing a funny and considerably ribald song. They made lots of lusty,\r\nprimitive noise. When they were finished, Ramos, still in a spirit of\r\nhumor, corned up an old Mexican number about disappointed love.\r\n\r\n_\"Adios, Mujer--\r\n\r\nAdios para siempre--\r\n\r\nAdios...\"_\r\n\r\nRamos wailed out the last syllable with lugubrious emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Always it's girls,\" Dave Lester managed to chuckle. \"I still don't see\r\nhow they expect to find many, Out There.\"\r\n\r\n\"If our Eileen has--or will--make it, she won't be the first--or last,\"\r\nFrank offered, almost mystically.\r\n\r\n\"Hey--I was right about the word, _wild_,\" Two-and-Two mused.\r\n\"Yeah--we're all just plum-full of wanting to be wild. Not _mean_ wild,\r\nmostly--constructive wild, instead. And, damn, we'll _do_ it...!\r\nCripes--we ought to come back to old Paul's place in June, ten years\r\nfrom now, and tell each other what we've accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn--that's a fine idea, Two-and-Two!\" David Lester piped up. \"I'll\r\nsuggest it to the other guys, first chance I get...!\"\r\n\r\nOf course it was another piece of callow whistling in the dark, but it\r\nwas a buildup, too. Coming home at a fixed, future time, to compare\r\nglittering successes. Eldorados found and exploited, cities built, giant\r\nbusinesses established, hearts won, real manhood achieved past\r\nstaggering difficulties. But they all had to believe it, to combat the\r\nicy sliver of dread concerning an event that was getting very near, now.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey sat with his mouth organ cupped in his hands. He began to\r\nmake soft, musing chords, tried a fragment of Old Man River, shifted\r\nbriefly to a spiritual, and wound up with some eerie, impromptu\r\nfragments, partly like the drums and jingling brass of old Africa,\r\npartly like a joyful battle, partly like a lonesome lament, and then,\r\nmysteriously like absolute silence.\r\n\r\nStorey stopped, abashed. He grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Reaching for Out There, Mitch?\" Frank Nelsen asked. \"Music of your own,\r\nto tell about space? Got any words for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" Mitch said. \"Maybe it shouldn't have any words. Anyhow, the tune\r\ndoesn't come clear, yet. I haven't been--There.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe some more of Otto's beer will help,\" Frank suggested. \"Here--one\r\ncan, each, to begin.\" For once, Frank had an urge to get slightly\r\npie-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"High's a good word,\" he amended. \"High and sky! Mars and stars!\"\r\n\r\n\"Space and race, nuts and guts!\" Lester put in, trying to belong, and be\r\nlight-minded, like he thought the others were, instead of a scared,\r\npedantic kid. He slapped the blastoff drum under him, familiarly, as if\r\nto draw confidence from its grim, cool lines.\r\n\r\nThe whole Bunch was quite a bit like that, for a good part of the night,\r\nshouting lustily back and forth between the two trucks, laughing,\r\nsinging, wise-cracking, drinking up Otto Kramer's Pepsi and beer.\r\n\r\nBut at last, Gimp Hines, remembering wisdom, spoke up. \"We're supposed\r\nto be under mild sedation--a devil-killer, a tranquilizer--for at least\r\nthirty hours. It's in the rules for prospective ground-to-orbit\r\ncandidates. We're supposed to be sleeping good. Here goes my pill--down,\r\nwith the last of my beer...\"\r\n\r\nFaces sobered, and became strained and careful, again. The guys on the\r\ntrucks bedded down as best they could, among their gaunt equipment. Soon\r\nthere were troubled snores from huddled figures that quivered with the\r\nmotion of the vehicles. The mottled Moon rode high. Big tires whispered\r\non damp concrete. Lights blinked past. The trucks curved around corners,\r\ngrowled up grades, highballed down. There were pauses at all-night\r\ndrive-ins, coffees misguidedly drunk in a blurred, fur-tongued half\r\nwakefulness that seemed utterly bleak. Oh, hell, Frank Nelsen thought,\r\nwasn't it far better to be home in bed, like Jig Hollins?\r\n\r\nAt grey dawn, there was a breakfast stop, the two truck drivers and\r\ntheir relief man grinning cynically at the Bunch. Then there was more\r\ncountry, rolling and speeding past. Wakefulness was half sleep, and\r\nvice-versa. And the hours, through the day and another night, dwindled\r\ntoward blastoff time, at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the second dawn came, the Bunch were all tautly and wearily alert\r\nagain, peering ahead, across dun desert. There wasn't much fallout from\r\nthe carefully developed hydrogen-fusion engines of the GO rockets, but\r\nmaybe there was enough to distort the genes of the cacti a little,\r\nmaking their forms more grotesque.\r\n\r\nAlong the highway there were arrows and signs. When the trucks had\r\nlabored to the top of a ridge, the spaceport installations came into\r\nview all at once:\r\n\r\nBarbed-wire fences, low, olive-drab gate buildings, guidance tower, the\r\nmagnesium dome of a powerhouse reactor, repair and maintenance shops,\r\npersonnel-housing area carefully shielded against radiation by a huge\r\nstellene bubble, sealed and air-conditioned, with double-doored\r\nentrances and exits. Inside it were visible neat bungalows, lawns,\r\ngardens, supermarket, swimming pools, swings, a kid's bike left casually\r\nhere or there.\r\n\r\nThe first sunshine glinted on the two rockets and their single,\r\nattendant gantry tower, waiting on the launching pad. The rockets were\r\nas gaunt as sharks. They might almost have been natural spires on the\r\nMoon, or ruined towers left by the extinct beings of Mars. At first they\r\nwere impersonal and expected parts of the scene, until the numbers,\r\nceramic-enamelled on their striped flanks, were noticed: GO-11 and\r\nGO-12.\r\n\r\n\"They're us--up the old roller coaster!\" Charlie Reynolds shouted.\r\n\r\nThen everybody was checking his blastoff ticket, as if he didn't\r\nremember the number primly typed on it. Frank Nelsen had GO-12.\r\nGO--Ground-to-Orbit. But it might as well mean go! glory, or gallows, he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe trucks reached the gate. The Bunch met the bored and cynical\r\nreception committee--a half-dozen U.S.S.F. men in radiation coveralls.\r\n\r\nEach of the Bunch held his blastoff ticket, his space-fitness and his\r\nequipment-inspection cards meekly in sweaty fingers. It was an old\r\nstory--the unknowing standing vulnerable before the knowing and perhaps\r\nharsh.\r\n\r\nNelsen guessed at some of the significance of the looks they all\r\nreceived: Another batch of greenhorns--to conquer and develop and\r\npopulate the extra-terrestrial regions. They all come the same way, and\r\nlook alike. Poor saps...\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen longed to paste somebody, even in the absence of absolute\r\nimpoliteness.\r\n\r\nThe blastoff drums were already being lifted off the trucks, weighed,\r\nscreened electronically, and moved toward a loading elevator on a\r\nconveyor. The whole process was automatic.\r\n\r\n\"Nine men--ten drums--how come?\" one of the U.S.S.F. people inquired.\r\n\r\n\"A spare. Its GO carriage charge is paid,\" Reynolds answered.\r\n\r\nHe got an amused and tired smirk. \"Okay, Sexy--it's all right with us.\r\nAnd I hope you fellas were smart enough not to eat any breakfast. Of\r\ncourse we'd like to have you say--tentatively--where you'll be headed,\r\non your own power, after we toss you Upstairs. Toward the Moon, huh,\r\nlike most fledglings say? It helps a little to know. Some new folks\r\nstart to scream and get lost, up there. See how it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--we see--thanks. Yes--the Moon.\" This was still Charlie Reynolds\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\"No problem, then, Sexy. We mean to be gentle. Now let's move along, in\r\nline. Never mind consulting wristwatches--we've got over four hours\r\nleft. Final blood pressure check, first. Then the shot, the\r\ndevil-killer, the wit-sharpener. And try to remember some of what you're\r\nsupposed to have learned. Relax, don't talk too much, and try not to\r\nswallow any live butterflies.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician, looking them over, shook his head and made a wry face of\r\ninfinite sadness, when he came to Gimp and Lester, but he offered no\r\ncomment except a helpless shrug.\r\n\r\nThe U.S.S.F. spokesman was still with them. \"All right--armor up. Let's\r\nsee how good you are at it.\"\r\n\r\nThey scrambled to it grimly, and still a little clumsily. Gimp Hines\r\nhad, of course, long ago tailored his Archer to fit that shrunken right\r\nleg. Then they just sat around in the big locker room, trying to get\r\nused to being enclosed like this, much of the time, checking to see that\r\neverything was functioning right, listening to the muffled voices that\r\nstill reached them from beyond their protecting encasement. They could\r\nstill have conversed, by direct sound or by helmet-radio, but the\r\ndevil-killer seemed to subdue the impulse, and for a while caused a\r\ndreaminess that shortened the long wait...\r\n\r\n\"Okay--time to move!\"\r\n\r\nHeavy with their Archies, they filed out into desert sun-glare that\r\ntheir darkened helmets made feeble. They arose in the long climb of the\r\ngantry elevator and split into two groups, for the two rockets,\r\naccording to their GO numbers. It didn't seem to matter, now, who went\r\nwith whom. Each man had his own private sweating party. The padded\r\npassenger compartments were above the blastoff drum freight sections.\r\n\r\n\"Helmets secure? Air-restorer systems on? Phones working? Answer roll\r\ncall if you hear me. Baines, George?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" Two-and-Two responded, loud and plain in Frank Nelsen's phone,\r\nfrom the other rocket.\r\n\r\n\"Hines, Walter?\"\r\n\r\nOne by one the names were called... \"Kuzak, Arthur?... Kuzak,\r\nJoseph?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay--the Mystic Nine, eh? Lash down!\"\r\n\r\nThey lay on their backs on the padded floors, and fastened the straps.\r\nGimp Hines, next to Frank, seemed to have discarded his crutches,\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nThe inspector swaggered around among them, jerking straps, and tapping\r\nshoulders and buttocks straight on the floor padding with a boot toe.\r\n\r\n\"All right--not good, not too bad. Ease off--shut your eyes, maybe. The\r\nnext twenty minutes are ours. The rest are yours, except for orders. I\r\nhope you remember your jump procedures. Also that there are a lot of\r\nwooden nickels Upstairs--in orbit, on the Moon, anyplace. We'll call\r\nsome of your shots from the ground. Good luck--and Glory help you...\"\r\n\r\nThe growl in their phones died away with the muffled footsteps. Doors\r\nclosed on their gaskets and were dogged, automatically.\r\n\r\nThen it was like waiting five minutes more, inside a cannon barrel.\r\nThere was a buzzing whisper of nuclear exciters. The roar of power cut\r\nin. A soft lurch told that the rockets were off the ground--fireborne.\r\nThe pressure of acceleration mounted. You closed your eyes to make the\r\nblackness seem natural, instead of a blackout in your optic nerves, and\r\nthe threadiness of your mind seem like sleep. But you felt smothered,\r\njust the same. Somebody grunted. Somebody gave a thick cry.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen had the strange thought that, by his body's mounting\r\nvelocity, enough kinetic energy was being pumped into it to burn it to\r\nvapor in an instant, if it ever hit the air. But it was the energy of\r\nfreedom from gravity, from the Earth, from home--_for_ adventure.\r\nFreedom to wander the solar system, at last! He tried, still, to believe\r\nin the magnificence of it, as the thrust of rocket power ended, and the\r\nweightlessness of orbital flight came dizzily.\r\n\r\nHe didn't consciously hear the order to leave the orbiting GO-12, which\r\nwas moving only about five hundred feet from it's companion, GO-11. But,\r\nlike most of the others, he worked his way with dogged purpose through\r\nwhat seemed a fuzzy nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the passenger compartments had opened; likewise the\r\nblastoff drums had been ejected automatically, and were orbiting free.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was Gimp who moved ahead of him. Looking out, Frank saw what\r\nwas certainly Ramos, already straddling a drum marked with a huge red\r\nM.R., riding it like a jaunty troll on a seahorse. He saw the Kuzaks\r\ndive for their initialled drums, big men not yet as apt in this new game\r\nas in football, but grimly determined to learn fast. The motion was all\r\nas silent as a shadow.\r\n\r\nThen Frank jumped for his own drum, and found himself turning slowly\r\nend-over-end, seeing first the pearl-mist curve that was the Earth, then\r\nthe brown-black, chalk-smeared sky, with the bright needle points and\r\nthe corona-winged sun in it. Instinct made him grab futilely outward,\r\nfor the sense of weightlessness was the same as endless fall. He _was_\r\nfalling, around the Earth, his forward motion exactly balancing his\r\ndownward motion, in a locked ellipse, a closed trajectory.\r\n\r\nHis mind cleared very fast--that must have been another phase of the\r\ndevil-killer shot coming into action. Controlling panic, he relocated\r\nhis drum, marked by a splashed red F.N., set his tiny shoulder ionic in\r\noperation, and reached back to move its flexible guide, first to stop\r\nhis spin, then to produce forward motion. He got to the drum, and just\r\nclung to it for a moment.\r\n\r\nBut in the next instant he was looking into the embarrassed, anguished\r\nface of a person, who, like a drowning man, had come to hang onto it for\r\ndear life, too.\r\n\r\n\"Frank, I--I even dirtied myself...\"\r\n\r\n\"So what? Over there is your gear, Two-and-Two--go get it!\" Frank\r\nshouted into his phone, the receiver of which was now full of sounds--a\r\nmoaning grunt, a vast hiccuping, shouts, exhortations.\r\n\r\n\"Easy, Les,\" Reynolds was saying. \"Can you reach a pill from the rack\r\ninside your chest plate, and swallow it? Just float quietly--nothing'll\r\nhappen. We've got work to do for a few minutes... We'll look after you\r\nlater... Cripes, Mitch--he can't take it. Jab the knockout needle right\r\nthrough the sleeve of his Archer, like we read in the manuals. The\r\ninterwall gum will seal the puncture...\"\r\n\r\nJust then the order came, maddeningly calm and hard above the other\r\nsounds in Frank's phone: \"All novices disembarked from GOs-11 and -12\r\nmust clear four-hundred mile take-off orbital zone for other traffic\r\nwithin two hours.\"\r\n\r\nAt once Frank was furiously busy, working the darkened stellene of his\r\nbubb from the drum, letting it spread like a long wisp of silvery cobweb\r\nagainst the stars, letting it inflate from the air-flasks to a firm and\r\nbeautiful circle, attaching the rigging, the fine, radial\r\nspokewires--for which the blastoff drum itself now formed the hub. To\r\nthe latter he now attached his full-size, sun-powered ionic motor. Then\r\nhe crept through the double sealing flaps of the airlock, to install the\r\nair-restorer and the moisture-reclaimer in the circular, tunnel-like\r\ninterior that would now be his habitation.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't racing anything except time, but he had worked as fast as he\r\ncould. Still, Gimp Hines had finished rigging his bubb, minutes ahead of\r\nFrank, or anybody else. On second thought, maybe this was natural\r\nenough. Here, where there was no weight, his useless leg made no\r\ndifference--as the space-fitness examiners must have known. Besides,\r\nGimp had talented fingers and a keen mechanical sense, and had always\r\ntried harder than anybody.\r\n\r\nRamos was almost as quick. Frank wasn't much farther behind. The Kuzaks\r\nwere likewise doing all right. Two-and-Two was trailing some, but not\r\nvery badly.\r\n\r\n\"Spin 'em!\" Gimp shouted. \"Don't forget to spin 'em for\r\ncentrifuge-gravity and stability!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they did, each gripping the rigging at their bubb rims, and using\r\nthe minute but accumulative thrust of the shoulder ionics of their\r\nArchers, to provide the push. The inflated rings turned like wheels with\r\nperfect bearings. In the all but frictionless void, they could go on\r\nturning for decades, without additional impetus.\r\n\r\n\"We've made it--we're Out Here--we're all right!\" Ramos was shouting\r\nwith a fierce exultation.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Ramos!\" Frank Nelsen yelled back. \"Don't ever say that, too\r\nsoon. Look around you!\"\r\n\r\nStorey and Reynolds were still struggling with their bubbs. They had\r\nbeen delayed by trying to quiet Dave Lester, who now floated in a\r\ndrugged stupor, lashed to his blastoff drum.\r\n\r\nSlowly, pushed by their shoulder ionics, Gimp, Ramos and Frank Nelsen\r\ndrifted over to see what they could do for Lester.\r\n\r\nHe was vaguely conscious, his eyes were glassy, his mouth drooled watery\r\nvomit.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want us to do, Les?\" Frank asked gently. \"We could put you\r\nback in one of the rockets. You'd be brought back to the spaceport, when\r\nthey are guided back by remote control.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know!\" Lester wailed in a hoarse voice. \"Fellas--I don't know!\r\nA little falling is all right... But it goes on all the time. I can't\r\nstand it! But if I'm sent back--I can't ever live with myself!...\"\r\n\r\nFrank felt the intense anguish of trying to decide somebody else's\r\nquandary that might be a life or death matter which would surely involve\r\nthem all. Damn, weak-kneed kid! How had he ever gotten so far?\r\n\r\n\"We should have set up his bubb first, put him inside, and spun it to\r\nkill that sense of fall!\" Gimp said. \"We'll do it, now! He should be all\r\nright. He _did_ pass his space-fitness tests, and the experts ought to\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nWith the three of them at it, and with the Kuzaks joining them in a\r\nmoment, the job was quickly finished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the sharp, commanding voice of Ground Control sounded in\r\ntheir phones, again: \"GOs-11 and -12 returning to port. Is all in order\r\namong delivered passengers? Sound out if true. Baines, George?...\"\r\n\r\nDavid Lester's name was called just before Frank Nelsen's, and he\r\nmanaged to say, \"In order!\" almost firmly, creating a damnable illusion,\r\nFrank thought. But for a moment, mixed with his anger, Frank felt a\r\nstrange, almost paternal gentleness, too.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the roll call, the doors of the GO rockets closed. Stubby\r\nwings, useful for the ticklish operation of skip-glide deceleration and\r\nre-entry into the atmosphere, slid out of their sheaths. Little, lateral\r\njets turned the vehicles around. Their main engines flamed lightly;\r\nlosing speed, they dipped in their paths, beginning to fall.\r\n\r\nWatching the rockets leave created a tingling sense of being left all\r\nalone, at an empty, breathless height from which you could never get\r\ndown--a height full of dazzling, unnatural sunshine, that in moments\r\nwould become the dreadful darkness of Earth's shadow.\r\n\r\n\"Hey--our spare drum--it'll drift off!\" Ramos shouted.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks dived to retrieve the cylinder. Others followed. But there\r\nwas a peculiar circumstance. The friction cover at one of its ends hung\r\nopen. There was a trailing wisp of stellene--part of the bubb packed\r\ninside--and a thin, angry face with rather hysterical eyes, within the\r\nhelmet of an Archer Five.\r\n\r\n\"Shhh--it ain't safe for me to come out yet,\" Glen Tiflin hissed\r\nthreateningly. \"Damn you all--if you dare queer me...!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cripes--another Jonah!\" Charlie Reynolds growled.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen looked at the Kuzaks, floating near.\r\n\r\n\"Well--what could we do?\" Joe Kuzak, the gentler twin, whispered. \"He\r\ncame back to Jarviston, to our rooming house, one night. We promised to\r\nhelp him a little. What are you going to do with a character nuts enough\r\nabout space to armor up and stuff himself inside a blastoff drum? Of\r\ncourse he didn't come that way from home. There's that electronic check\r\nof drum contents at the gate of the port. But he was there on a\r\nvisitor's pass, waiting--having hitchhiked all the way to here. After\r\nthe electronic check, he figured on stowing away, while the drums were\r\nwaiting to be loaded. The only thing we did to help was to take a little\r\nof the stuff out of the spare drum and stow it in our two drums, to\r\nleave him some room. We thought sure he'd be caught, quick. But you can\r\nsee how he got away with it. Those U.S.S.F. boys at the port don't\r\nreally give a damn who gets Out Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay--I'll buy it,\" Reynolds sighed heavily. \"Good luck with the stunt,\r\nTif.\"\r\n\r\nTiflin only gave him a poisonous glare, as the nine fragile, gleaming\r\nrings, the drifting men and the spare drum, orbited on into the Earth's\r\nshadow, not nearly as dark as it might have been because the Moon was\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better rig the parabolic mirrors of the ionics to catch the first\r\nsunshine in about forty minutes, so we can start moving out of orbit,\"\r\nRamos said. \"We'll have to think of food, sometime, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Food, yet--ugh!\" Art Kuzak grunted.\r\n\r\nFrank felt the fingers of spasm taking hold of his stomach. Most\r\neverybody was getting fall-sick, now, their insides not finding any up\r\nor down direction. But the guys wavered back to their bubbs. The\r\nshoulder ionics of their Archers, though normally sun-energized, could\r\ndraw power from the small nuclear batteries of the armor during the rare\r\nmoments when there could be darkness anywhere in solar space.\r\n\r\nThe Planet Strappers stood in the rigging of their fragile vehicles,\r\nsetting the full-sized ionics to produce increased acceleration which\r\nwould gradually push the craft beyond orbit. Joe Kuzak ran a steel wire\r\nfrom a pivot bolt at the hub of his ring, to tow Tiflin and his drum.\r\n\r\nThen everybody crawled into their respective bubbs, most of them needing\r\nthe centrifugal gravity to help straighten out their fall-sickness.\r\n\r\n\"My neck is swelling, too,\" Frank Nelsen heard Charlie Reynolds say.\r\n\"Lymphatic glands sometimes bog down in the absence of weight. Don't\r\nworry if it happens to some of you. We know that it straightens out.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes it seemed that they had a small respite in their\r\nstruggle for adjustment to a fantastic environment.\r\n\r\n\"Well--I got cleaned up, some--that's better,\" Two-and-Two said. \"But\r\nlook at the fuzzy lights down on Earth. Hell, is it right for a fella to\r\nbe looking down on the lights of Paris, Moscow, Cairo, and Rangoon--when\r\nhe hasn't ever been any farther than Minneapolis?\" Two-and-Two sounded\r\nfabulously befuddled.\r\n\r\nDavid Lester started screaming again. They had left him alone and\r\napparently unconscious, inside his ring, because all ionics, including\r\nhis, had had to be set. Then, in the pressure of events, they had almost\r\nforgotten him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go look,\" Frank Nelsen said.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey was there ahead of him. Mitch's helmet was off; his dark\r\nface was all planes and hollows in the moonlight coming through the\r\nthin, transparent walls of the vehicle. \"Should we call the U.S.S.F.\r\npatrol, Frank?\" he asked anxiously. \"Have them take him off? 'Cause he\r\nsure can't stand another devil-killer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better,\" Frank answered quickly.\r\n\r\nBut now Tiflin, having deserted his blastoff drum, was coming through\r\nthe airlock flaps, too. He stepped forward gingerly, along the spinning,\r\nring-shaped tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"Poor bookworm,\" he growled in a tone curiously soft for Glen Tiflin.\r\n\"Think I don't understand how it is? And how do you know if he _wants_\r\nto get sent back?\"\r\n\r\nMitch had removed Lester's helmet, too. Tiflin knelt. His arm moved with\r\nsavage quickness. There was the crack of knuckles, in a rubberized\r\nsteel-fabric space glove, against Lester's jaw. His hysterical eyes\r\nglazed and closed; his face relaxed.\r\n\r\nFor a second of intolerable fury, Frank wanted to tear Tiflin apart.\r\n\r\nBut Mitch half-grinned. \"That might be an answer,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThey plopped where they were, and tried to rest until the orbiting\r\ncluster of rings emerged from Earth's shadow into blazing sunshine,\r\nagain. Then Mitch and Frank returned to their own bubbs to check on the\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\nIt was soon plain that Joe Kuzak's bubb, towing Tiflin's drum, would\r\nlag.\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" Art Kuzak snapped. \"Get that character out here to help us\r\ninflate and rig his own equipment! We did enough for him! So if the\r\nForce notices that there are ten bubbs instead of nine, the extra is\r\nstill just our spare... Hey--Tiflin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts--I'm looking after Pantywaist,\" Tiflin growled back.\r\n\r\n\"Awright,\" Art returned. \"So we just cast your junk adrift! Come on,\r\nboy!\" There was no kidding in the dry tone.\r\n\r\nTiflin snarled but obeyed.\r\n\r\nIons jetting from the Earthward hub-ends of the rotating rings, yielded\r\ntheir steady few pounds of thrust. The gradual outward spiral began.\r\n\r\n\"Cripes--I'm not sure I can even astrogate to the Moon,\" Two-and-Two was\r\nheard to complain.\r\n\r\n\"I'll check your ionic setting for you, Two-and-Two,\" Gimp answered him.\r\n\"After that the acceleration should continue properly without much\r\nattention. So how about you and me taking first watch, while the others\r\nease off a little...?\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen crept carefully back into his own rotating ring, still half\r\nafraid that an armored knee or elbow might go right through the thin,\r\nyielding stellene. Prone, and with his helmet still sealed, he slipped\r\ninto the fog which the tranquilizer now induced in his brain, while the\r\nuniverse of stars, Moon, sun and Earth tumbled regularly around him.\r\n\r\nHe dreamed of yelling in endless fall, and of climbing over metal-veined\r\nchunks of a broken world, where once there had been air, sea, desert and\r\nforest, and minds not unlike those of men, but in bodies that were far\r\ndifferent. Gurgling thickly, he awoke, and snapped on his helmet phone\r\nto kill the utter silence.\r\n\r\nSomeone muttered a prayer in a foreign tongue:\r\n\r\n\"... _Nuestra Dama de Guadalupe--te pido, por favor... Tengo miedo_--I'm\r\nscared... _Pero pienso mas en ella_--I think more of her. _Mi chula, mi\r\nlinda_... My beautiful Eileen... Keep her--\"\r\n\r\nThe prayer broke off, as if a switch was turned. It had been brash\r\nRamos... Now there were only some fragments of harmonica music...\r\n\r\nFrank slipped into the blur, again, awakening at last with Two-and-Two\r\nshaking his shoulder. \"Hey, Frankie--we're five hours out, by the\r\nchronometers--look how small the Earth has got...! We're all gonna have\r\nbrunch in Ramos' vehicle... Know what that goof ball Mex was doing,\r\nbefore? Stripped down to his shorts, and with the spin stopped for\r\nzero-G, he was bouncing back and forth from wall to wall inside his\r\nbubb! The sun makes it nice and warm in there. Think I might try it,\r\nmyself, sometime. Shucks, I feel pretty good, now... Frankie, ain't you\r\nhungry?\"\r\n\r\nFrank felt limp as a rag, but he felt much better than before, and he\r\ncould stand some nourishment. \"Lead on, Two-and-Two,\" he said.\r\n\r\nRamos' bubb was spinning once more, but he was wearing just dungarees.\r\nThe Bunch--the Planet Strappers--with only their helmets off, were\r\ncrouched, evenly spaced, around the circular interior of the ring. Dave\r\nLester was there, too--staring, but fairly calm, now. In this curious\r\nplace, there was a delicious and improbable aroma of coffee--cooked by\r\nmirror-reflected sunlight on a tiny solar stove.\r\n\r\n\"So that's the way it goes,\" Charlie Reynolds commented profoundly. \"We\r\nreach out for strangeness. Then we try to make it as familiar as home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stew, warmed in the cans, too,\" Ramos declared. \"Enough for a light\r\none-time-around. I brought the stew along. Hope you birds remember.\r\nThen we're back on dehydrates. Hell, except for that weight problem and\r\nconsequent cost of stuff from Earth, we'd have it made, Out Here. The\r\nBig Vacuum ain't so tough--no storms in it, even, to tear our bubbs\r\napart. I guess we won't ever have a bigger adventure than finding out\r\nfor ourselves that we can get along with space.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had a beef roast, we'd put it in a sealed container of clear\r\nplastic,\" Gimp laughed. \"Set it turning, outside the bubb, on a swiveled\r\ntether wire. It would rotate for hours like on a spit--almost no\r\nfriction. Rig some mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat. Space Force\r\nmen do things like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up--I'm getting _hong_-gry!\" Art Kuzak roared.\r\n\r\nRamos poured the coffee in the thin magnesium cups that each of the\r\nBunch had brought. Their squeeze bottles, for zero-G drinking, were not\r\nnecessary, here. Their skimpy portions of stew were spooned on magnesium\r\nplates. Knife and fork combinations were brought out. An apple purée\r\nwhich had been powder, followed the stew. Brunch was soon over.\r\n\r\n\"That's all for now, folks,\" Ramos said ruefully.\r\n\r\nTiflin snaked a cigarette out from inside the collar of his Archer.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Reynolds said mildly. \"Oxygen, remember? Shouldn't you ask our\r\nhost, first?\"\r\n\r\nRamos had eased up on ribbing Tiflin months ago. \"It's okay,\" he said.\r\n\"The air-restorers are new.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tiflin's explosive nerves, under strain for a long time, didn't take\r\nit. He threw down the unlighted fag. He snicked his switch blade from a\r\nthigh pocket. For an instant it seemed that he would attack Reynolds.\r\nThen the knife flew, and penetrated the thin, taut wall, to its handle.\r\nThere was a frightening hiss, until the sealing gum between the double\r\nlayers, cut off the leak.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks had Tiflin helpless and snarling, at once.\r\n\r\n\"Get a patch, somebody--fix up the hole,\" Joe, the mild one, growled.\r\n\"Tiflin--me and my brother helped you. Now we're gonna sit on you--just\r\nto make sure your funny business doesn't kill us all. Try anything just\r\n_once_, and we'll feed you all that vacuum--without an Archer. If you're\r\na good boy, maybe you'll live to get dumped on the Moon as we pass by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts--let's give this sick rat to the Space Force right now.\" Art Kuzak\r\nhissed. \"Here comes their patrol bubb.\"\r\n\r\nThe glinting, transparent ring with the barred white star was passing at\r\na distance.\r\n\r\n\"All is well with you novices?\" The enquiring voice was a gruff drawl,\r\nmingled with crunching sounds of eating--perhaps a candy bar.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Tiflin whispered, pleading. \"I'll watch myself!\"\r\n\r\nThe United Nations patrol was out, too, farther off. Another, darker\r\nbubb, with other markings, passed by, quite close. It had foreign lines,\r\nmore than a bit sinister to the Bunch's first, startled view. It was a\r\nTovie vehicle, representing the other side of the still--for the most\r\npart--passively opposed forces, on Earth, and far beyond. But through\r\nthe darkened transparency of stellene, the armored figures--again\r\nsomewhat sinister--only raised their hands in greeting.\r\n\r\nIn a minute, Frank Nelsen emerged from Ramos' ring. Floating free, he\r\nstabilized himself, fussed with the radio antenna of his helmet-phone\r\nfor a moment, making its transmission and reception directional. On the\r\nmisty, shrinking Earth, North America was visible.\r\n\r\n\"Frank Nelsen to Paul Hendricks,\" he said. \"Frank Nelsen to Paul\r\nHendricks...\"\r\n\r\nPaul was waiting, all right. \"Hello, Frankie. Some of the guys talked\r\nalready--said you were asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Paul--yeah! Terra still looks big and beautiful. We're okay.\r\nAmazing, isn't it, how just a few watts of power, beamed out in a thin\r\nthread, will reach this far, and lots farther? Hey--will you open and\r\nshut your front door? Let's hear the old customer's bell jingle... Best\r\nto you, to J. John, to Nance Codiss, Miss Parks--everybody...\"\r\n\r\nThe squeak of hinges and the jingling came through, clear and\r\nnostalgically.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Frank,\" Two-and-Two urged. \"Other guys would like to talk to\r\nPaul... Hey, Paul--maybe you could get my folks down to the store to say\r\nhello to me on your transmitter. And I guess Les would appreciate it if\r\nyou got his mother...\"\r\n\r\nWhen the talk got private, Frank went to Mitch Storey's bubb.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to show you,\" Mitch said. \"I brought seeds, and these little\r\nplastic tubes with holes in them, that you can string around inside a\r\nbubb. The weight is next to nothing. Put the seeds in the tubes, and\r\nwater with plant food in solution. The plants come up through the holes.\r\nHydroponics. Gotta almost do it, if I'm going way out to Mars without\r\nmuch supplies. Maybe, before I get there, I'll have even ripe tomatoes!\r\n'Cause, with sun all the time, the stuff grows like fury, they say. I'll\r\nhave string beans and onions and flowers, anyhow! Helps keep the air\r\noxygen-fresh, too. Wish I had a few bumble bees! 'Cause now I'll have to\r\npollenate by hand...\"\r\n\r\nNope--Mitch couldn't get away from vegetation, even in space.\r\n\r\nThe Planet Strappers soon established a routine for their journey out as\r\nfar as the Moon. There were watches, to be sure that none of the bubbs\r\nveered, while somebody was asleep or inattentive. Always at hand were\r\nloaded rifles, because you never knew what kind of space-soured men--who\r\nmight once have been as tame as neighbors going for a drive on Sundays\r\nwith their families--might be around, even here.\r\n\r\nNeither Kuzak slept, if the other wasn't awake. They were watching\r\nTiflin, whose bubb rode a little ahead of the others. He was ostracized,\r\nmore or less.\r\n\r\nEverybody took to Ramos' kind of exercise, bouncing around inside a\r\nbubb--even Lester, who was calmer, now, but obviously strained by the\r\nvast novelty and uncertainty ahead.\r\n\r\n\"I gave you guys a hard time--I'm sorry,\" he apologized. \"But I hope\r\nthere won't be any more of that. The Bunch will be breaking up, soon, I\r\nguess--going here and there. And if I get a job at Serenitatis Base, I\r\nthink I'll be okay.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen hoped that he could escape any further part of Lester, but\r\nhe wasn't sure that he had the guts to desert him.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before the ionics were shut off. Enough velocity had been\r\nattained. Soon, the thrust would be needed in reverse, for braking\r\naction, near the end of the sixty hour journey into a circumlunar orbit.\r\n\r\nSleep was a fitful, dream-haunted thing. Food was now mostly a kind of\r\ngruel, rich in starches, proteins, fats and vitamins--each meal\r\ndifferently flavored, up to the number of ten flavors, in a\r\nmanufacturer's attempt to mask the sameness. Add water to a powder--heat\r\nand eat. The spaceman's usual diet, while afield...\r\n\r\nOne of the functions of the moisture-reclaimers was a rough joke, or a\r\nsqueamishness. A man's kidneys and bowels functioned, and precious water\r\nmolecules couldn't be wasted, here in the dehydrated emptiness. But what\r\ndifference did it really make, after the sanitary distillation of a\r\nreclaimer? Accept, adjust...\r\n\r\nDecision about employment or activity in the immediate future, was one\r\nthing that couldn't be dismissed. And announcements, beamed from the\r\nMoon, emphasized it:\r\n\r\n\"Serenitatis Base, seventeenth month-day, sixteenth hour. (There was a\r\nchime) Lunar Projects Placement is here to serve you. Plastics-chemists,\r\nhydroponics specialists, machinists, mechanics, metallurgists, miners,\r\nhelpers--all are urgently needed. The tax-free pay will startle you.\r\nFree subsistence and quarters. Here at Serene, at Tycho Station or at a\r\ndozen other expanding sites...\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Reynolds sat with Frank Nelsen while he listened. \"The lady has\r\na swell voice,\" said Charlie. \"Otherwise, it _sounds_ good, too. But I'm\r\none that's going farther. To Venus--just being explored. All fresh, and\r\nno man-made booby traps, at least. Maybe they'll even figure out a way\r\nto make it rotate faster, give it a reasonably short day, and a\r\nbreathable atmosphere--make a warmer second Earth out of it...\r\nSometimes, when you jump farther, you jump over a lot of trouble. Better\r\nthan going slow, with the faint-hearts. Their muddling misfortunes begin\r\nto stick to you. I'd rather be Mitch, headed for heebie-jeebie Mars, or\r\nthe Kuzaks, aiming for the crazy Asteroid Belt.\"\r\n\r\nThat was Charlie, talking to him--Frank Nelsen--like an older brother.\r\nIt made a sharp doubt in him, again. But then he grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I am a slow starter,\" he said. \"The Moon is near and humble, but\r\nsome say it's good training--even harsher than space. And I don't want\r\nto bypass and miss anything. Oh, hell, Charlie--I'll get farther, soon,\r\ntoo! But I really don't even know what I'll do, yet. Got to wait and see\r\nhow the cards fall...\"\r\n\r\nSeveral hours before the rest of the Bunch curved into a slow orbit a\r\nthousand miles above the Moon, Glen Tiflin set the ionic of his bubb for\r\nfull acceleration, and arced away, outward, perhaps toward the Belt.\r\n\r\n\"So long, all you dumb slobs!\" his voice hissed in their helmet-phones.\r\n\"Now I get really lost! If you ever cross my path again, watch your\r\nheads...\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak's flare of anger died. \"Good riddance,\" he breathed. \"How long\r\nwill he last, alone? Without a space-fitness card, the poor idiot\r\nprobably imagines himself a big, dangerous renegade, already.\"\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak's answering tone almost had a shrug in it. \"Don't jinx our\r\nluck, twin brother,\" he said. \"For that matter, how long will _we_\r\nlast...? Mex, did you toss Tiflin back his shiv?\"\r\n\r\n\"A couple of hours ago,\" Ramos answered mildly.\r\n\r\nEverybody was looking down at the Moon, whose crater-pocked ugliness and\r\nbeauty was sparsely dotted with the blue spots of stellene domes, many\r\nof them housing embryo enterprises that were trying to beat the blastoff\r\ncost of necessities brought from Earth, and to supply spacemen and\r\ncolonists with their needs, cheaply.\r\n\r\nThe nine fragile rings were soon in orbit. One worker-recruiting rocket\r\nand several trader-rockets--much less powerful than those needed to\r\nachieve orbit around Earth--because lunar gravity was only one-sixth of\r\nthe terrestrial--were floating in their midst. On the Moon it had of\r\ncourse been known that a fresh Bunch was on the way. Even telescopes\r\ncould have spotted them farther off than the distance of their 240,000\r\nmile leap.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's tongue tasted of brassy doubt. He didn't know where he'd\r\nbe, or what luck, good or bad, he might run into, within the next hour.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks were palavering with the occupants of two heavily-loaded\r\ntrader rockets. \"Sure we'll buy--if the price is right,\" Art was saying.\r\n\"Flasks of water and oxygen, medicines, rolls of stellene. Spare parts\r\nfor Archies, ionics, air-restorers. Food, clothes--anything we can sell,\r\nourselves...\"\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks must have at least a few thousand dollars, which they had\r\nprobably managed to borrow when they had gone home to Pennsylvania to\r\nsay goodbye.\r\n\r\nOut here, free of the grip of any large sphere, there was hardly a limit\r\nto the load which their ionics could eventually accelerate sufficiently\r\nto travel tremendous distances. Streamlining, in the vacuum, of course\r\nwasn't necessary, either.\r\n\r\nNow a small, sharp-featured man in an Archie, drifted close to Ramos and\r\nFrank, as they floated near their bubbs. \"Hello, Ramos, hello, Nelsen,\"\r\nhe said. \"Yes--we know your names. We investigate, beforehand, down on\r\nterra firma. We even have people to snap photographs--often you don't\r\neven notice. We like guys with talent who get out here by their own\r\nefforts. Shows they got guts--seriousness! But now you've arrived. We\r\nare Lunar Projects Placement. We need mechanics, process technicians,\r\nadministrative personnel--anything you can name, almost. Any bright lad\r\nwith drive enough to learn fast, suits us fine. Five hundred bucks an\r\nEarth-week, to start, meals and lodging thrown in. Quit any time you\r\nwant. Plenty of different working sites. Mines, refineries, factories,\r\nconstruction...\"\r\n\r\n\"Serenitatis Base?\" Ramos asked almost too quickly, Frank thought. And\r\nhe sounded curiously serious. Was this the Ramos who should be going a\r\nlot farther than the Moon, anyway?\r\n\r\n\"Hell, yes, fella!\" said the job scout.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent... You, too, guy?\" The scout was looking at Frank. \"And your\r\nother friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking about it,\" Frank answered cagily. \"Some of them aren't\r\nstopping on the Moon, as you can see.\"\r\n\r\nMitch Storey was lashing a few flasks of oxygen and water to the rim of\r\nhis bubb, being careful to space them evenly for static balance. He\r\ndidn't have the money to buy much more, even here.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks were preparing two huge bundles of supplies, which they\r\nintended to tow. Reynolds was also loading up a few things, with\r\nTwo-and-Two helping him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all set, Frank!\" Two-and-Two shouted. \"I'm going along with\r\nCharlie, maybe to crash the Venus exploration party!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" Frank shouted back, glad that this large, unsure person had\r\nfound himself a leader.\r\n\r\nNow he looked at Gimp Hines, riding the spinning rim of his ring with\r\nhis good and bad leg dangling, an expectant, quizzical, half-worried\r\nlook on his freckled face.\r\n\r\nBut Dave Lester was more pathetic. He had stopped the rotation of his\r\nbubb. He looked down first at the pitted, jagged face of the Moon, with\r\nan expression in which rapture and terror may have been mingled, glanced\r\nwith the hope of desperation toward the job scout, and then distractedly\r\ncontinued dismantling the rigging of his vehicle, as if to repack it in\r\nthe blastoff drum for a landing.\r\n\r\n\"Hey--hold on, Les!\" Two-and-Two shouted. \"You gotta know where you're\r\ngoing, first!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make up your mind, Nelsen,\" said the job scout, getting impatient. \"We\r\nhandle just about everything lunar--except in the Tovie areas. Without\r\nus, you're just a lost, fresh punk!\"\r\n\r\nBut another man had approached from another lunar GO rocket, which had\r\njust appeared. He had a thin intellectual face, dark eyes, trap mouth,\r\nwhite hair, soft speech that was almost shy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Xavier Rodan,\" he said. \"I search out my own employees. I do\r\nminerals survey--for gypsum, bauxite--anything. And site survey, for\r\nfactories and other future developments. I also have connections with\r\nthe Selenographic Institute of the University of Chicago. It is all\r\ninteresting work, but in a rather remote region, I'm afraid--the far\r\nside of the Moon. And I can pay only three hundred a week. Of course you\r\ncan resign whenever you wish. Perhaps you'd be interested--Mr. Nelsen,\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\nFrank had an impulse to jump at the chance--though there was a warning\r\ncoming to him from somewhere. But how could you ever know? You would\r\nalways have to go down to that devils' wilderness to find out.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try it, Mr. Rodan,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Selenography--that's one of my favorite subjects, sir!\" David Lester\r\nburst out, making a gingerly leap across the horrible void of spherical\r\nsky--stars in all directions except where the Moon's bulk hung. \"Could\r\nI--too?\" His trembling mouth looked desperate.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, boy,\" Rodan said at last. \"A hundred dollars for a week's\r\nwork period.\"\r\n\r\nFrank was glad that Lester had a place to go--and furious that he would\r\nprobably have to nursemaid him, after all.\r\n\r\nGimp Hines kept riding the rim of his ring like a merry-go-round, his\r\nface trying to show casual humor and indifference over ruefulness and\r\nscare. \"Nobody wants me,\" he said cheerfully. \"It's just prejudice and\r\npoor imagination. Well--I don't think I'll even try to prove how good I\r\nam. Of course I could shoot for the asteroids. But I'd like to look\r\naround Serenitatis Base--some, anyway. Will fifty bucks get me and my\r\nrig down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk to our pilot, Lame Fella,\" said the job scout. \"But you must be\r\nsuicidal nuts to be around here at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe others leapt to help Nelsen, Ramos, Gimp and Lester strip and pack\r\ntheir gear. Ramos' and Gimp's drums were loaded into the job scout's\r\nrocket. Nelsen's and Lester's went into Rodan's.\r\n\r\nGloved hands clasped gloved hands all around. The Bunch, the Planet\r\nStrappers, were breaking up.\r\n\r\n\"So long, you characters--see you around,\" said Art Kuzak. \"It won't be\r\nten years, before you all wind up in the Belt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring back the Mystery of Mars, Mitch!\" Frank was saying.\r\n\r\n\"When you get finished Mooning, come to Venus, Lover Lad,\" Reynolds told\r\nRamos. \"But good luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeez--I'm gonna get sentimental,\" Two-and-Two moaned. \"Luck everybody.\r\nCome on, Charlie--let's roll! I don't want to slobber!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll catch up with you all--watch!\" Gimp promised.\r\n\r\n\"So long, Frank...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--over the Milky Way, Frankie!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hasta luego_, Gang.\" This was all Ramos, the big mouth, had to say. He\r\nwasn't glum, exactly. But he was sort of preoccupied and impatient.\r\n\r\nThe five remaining rings--a wonderful sight, Frank thought--began to\r\nmove out of orbit. Ships with sails set for far ports. No--mere ships of\r\nthe sea were nothing, anymore. But would all of the Bunch survive?\r\n\r\nCharlie Reynolds, the cool one, the most likely to succeed, waved\r\njauntily and carelessly from his rotating, accelerating ring.\r\nTwo-and-Two wagged both arms stiffly from his.\r\n\r\nMitch Storey's bubb, lightest loaded, was jumping ahead. But you could\r\nhear him playing _Old Man River_ on his mouth organ, inside his helmet.\r\n\r\nThe Kuzaks' bubbs, towing massive loads, were accelerating slowest, with\r\nthe ex-gridiron twins riding the rigging. But their rings would dwindle\r\nto star specks before long, too.\r\n\r\nThe job scout's rocket, carrying Ramos and Gimp, began to flame for a\r\nlanding at Serene.\r\n\r\nIn the airtight cabin of Xavier Rodan's vehicle, Frank Nelsen and David\r\nLester had read and signed their contracts and had received their\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nRodan didn't smile. \"Now we'll go down and have a look at the place I'm\r\ninvestigating,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's view of empire-building on the Moon was brief, all\r\nencompassing, and far too sketchy to be very satisfying, as\r\nRodan--turned about in his universal-gimbaled pilot seat--spiralled his\r\nbattered rocket down backwards, with the small nuclear jets firing\r\nforward in jerky, tooth-cracking bursts, to check speed further.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to go around the abortive sub-planet that had always\r\naccompanied the Earth, almost once, to reduce velocity enough for a\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nThus, Nelsen glimpsed much territory--the splashed, irregular shape of\r\nSerenitatis, the international base on the mare, the dust sea of the\r\nsame name; the radiating threads of trails and embryo highways, the\r\never-widening separation of isolated domes and scattered human diggings\r\nand workings faintly scratched in the lunar crust, as, at a still great\r\nheight, Frank's gaze swept outward from the greatest center of human\r\nendeavor on the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt was much the same around Tycho Station, except that this base was\r\nsmaller, and was built in a great, white-rayed crater, whose walls were\r\npierced by tunnels for exit and entry.\r\n\r\nThe Tovie camp, glimpsed later, and only at the distant horizon, seemed\r\nnot very different from the others, except for the misleading patterns\r\nof camouflage. That the Tovies should have an exclusive center of their\r\nown was not even legal, according to U.N. agreements. But facts were\r\nfacts, and what did anyone do about them?\r\n\r\nFrank was not very concerned with such issues just then, for there was\r\nan impression that was overpowering: The slightness of the intrusion of\r\nhis kind on a two thousand-something miles-in-diameter globe of\r\nincredible desert, overlapping ring-walls, craters centered in radiating\r\nstreaks of white ash, mountain ranges that sank gradually into dust,\r\nwhich once, two billion years ago, after probable ejection from\r\nvolcanoes, had no doubt floated in a then palpable atmosphere. But now,\r\nto a lone man down there, they would be bleak plains stretching to a\r\ndisconcertingly near horizon.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's view was one of fascination, behind which was the chilly\r\nthought: This is my choice; here is where I will have to live for a\r\nshort while that can seem ages. Space looks tame, now. Can I make it all\r\nright? Worse--_how about Lester?_\r\n\r\nFrank looked around him. Like Rodan, Lester and he had both pivoted\r\naround in their gimbaled seats--to which they had safety-strapped\r\nthemselves--to face the now forward-pointing stern jets.\r\n\r\nRodan, looking more trap-mouthed than before, had said nothing further\r\nas he guided the craft gingerly lower. Lester was biting his heavy lip.\r\nHis narrow chin trembled.\r\n\r\nA faint whisper had begun. As far back as the 1940s, astronomers had\r\nbegun to suspect that the Moon was, after all, not entirely airless.\r\nThere would be traces of heavy gases--argon, neon, xenon, krypton, and\r\nvolcanic carbon dioxide. It would be expanded far upward above the\r\nsurface, because the feeble lunar gravity could not give it sufficient\r\nweight to compress it very much. So it would thin out much less rapidly\r\nwith altitude than does the terrestrial atmosphere. From a density of\r\nperhaps 1/12,000th of Earth's sea level norm at the Moon's surface, it\r\nwould thin to perhaps 1/20,000th at a height of eighty miles, being thus\r\nroughly equivalent in density to Earth's gaseous envelope at the same\r\nlevel! And at this height was the terrestrial zone where meteors flare!\r\n\r\nThis theory about the lunar atmosphere had proven to be correct. The\r\ntiny density was still sufficient to give the Moon almost as effective\r\nan atmospheric meteor screen as the Earth's. The relatively low velocity\r\nneeded to maintain vehicles in circumlunar orbits, made its danger to\r\nsuch vehicles small. It could help reduce speed for a landing; it caused\r\nthat innocuous hiss of passage. But it could sometimes be treacherous.\r\n\r\nFrank thought of these things as the long minutes dragged. Perhaps\r\nRodan, hunched intently over his controls, had reason enough, there, to\r\nbe silent...\r\n\r\nThe actual landing still had to be made in the only way possible on\r\nworlds whose air-covering was so close to a complete vacuum as\r\nthis--like a cat climbing down a tree backwards. With flaming jets still\r\nholding it up, and spinning gyros keeping it vertical, the rocket\r\nlowered gradually. The seats swung level, keeping their occupants right\r\nside up. There was a hovering pause, then the faint jolt of contact. The\r\njet growl stopped; complete silence closed in like a hammer blow.\r\n\r\n\"Do you men know where you are?\" Rodan asked after a moment.\r\n\r\n\"At the edge of Mare Nova, I think,\" Frank answered, his eyes combing\r\nthe demons' landscape beyond the thick, darkened glass of the cabin's\r\nports.\r\n\r\nThe dazzling sun was low--early morning of two weeks of daylight. The\r\nshadows were long, black shafts.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--there's Tower Rock,\" Lester quavered. \"And the Arabian Range going\r\ndown under the dust of the plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Correct,\" Rodan answered. \"We're well over the rim of the Far Side.\r\nYou'll never see the Earth from here. The nearest settlement is eight\r\nhundred miles away, and it's Tovie at that. This is a really remote\r\nspot, as I intimated before.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, as if to let this significant information be appreciated. \"So\r\nthat's settled,\" he went on. \"Now I'll enlighten you about what else you\r\nneed to know... Come along.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen felt the dust crunch under the rubberized boot-soles of his\r\nArcher. There was a brief walk, then a pause.\r\n\r\nRodan pointed to a pit dynamited out of the dust and lava rock, and to\r\nsmall piles of greyish material beside six-inch borings rectangularly\r\nspaced over a wide area.\r\n\r\n\"There is an extensive underlying layer of gypsum, here,\" he said. \"The\r\nwater-bearing rock. A mile away there's an ample deposit of\r\ngraphite--carbon. Thus, there exists a complete local source of\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and carbon, ideal for synthesizing various\r\nhydrocarbonic chemicals or making complicated polyethylene materials\r\nsuch as stellene, so useful in space. Lead, too, is not very far off.\r\nSilicon is, of course, available everywhere. There'll be a plant\r\nbelonging to Hoffman Chemicals here, before too long. I was prospecting\r\nfor them, for a site like this. Actually I was very lucky, locating this\r\nspot almost right away--which is fortunate. They think I'm still\r\nlooking, and aren't concerned...\"\r\n\r\nRodan was quiet for a moment before continuing. The pupils of his eyes\r\ndilated and contracted strangely.\r\n\r\n\"Because I found something else,\" he went on. \"It was luck beyond\r\ndreams, and it must be my very own. I intend to investigate it\r\nthoroughly, even if it takes years! Come along, again!\"\r\n\r\nThis time the walk was about three hundred yards, past three small\r\nstellene domes, the parabolic mirrors of a solar-power plant, a\r\nsun-energized tractor, and onward almost to the mountain wall, imbedded\r\nin the dust of the mare. There Frank noticed a circular, glassy area.\r\n\r\nStrips of magnesium were laid like bridging planks across chunks of\r\nlava, and in the dust all around were countless curious scrabbled marks.\r\n\r\nRodan stood carefully on a magnesium strip, and looked back at Nelsen\r\nand Lester, his brows crinkling as if he was suspicious that he had\r\nalready told them too much. Frank Nelsen became more aware of the heavy\r\nautomatic pistol at Rodan's hip, and felt a tingling urge to get away\r\nfrom here and from this man--as if a vast mistake had been made.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary for you to be informed about _some_ matters,\" Rodan\r\nsaid slowly. \"For instance, unless it is otherwise disturbed, a\r\nfootprint, or the like, will endure for millions of years on the\r\nMoon--as surely as if impressed in granite--because there is no weather\r\nleft to rub it out. You will be working here. I am preserving some of\r\nthese markings. So please walk on these strips, which Dutch and I have\r\nlaid down.\"\r\n\r\nRodan indicated a large, Archer-clad man, who also carried an automatic.\r\nHe had the face of a playful but dangerous mastiff. He was hunkered down\r\nin a shallow pit, scanning the ground with a watch-sized device probably\r\nintended for locating objects hidden just beneath the surface,\r\nelectronically. Beside him was a screen-bottomed container, no doubt\r\nmeant for sifting dust.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, Novices!\" he gruffed with genial contempt. But his pale\r\neyes, beyond the curve of his helmet, had a masked puzzlement, as if\r\nsomething from the lunar desolation had gotten into his brain, leaving\r\nthe realization of where he was, permanently not altogether clear to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nRodan pulled a shiny object from his thigh pouch, and held it out in a\r\ngloved palm for his new employees to peer at.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things we found,\" he remarked. \"Incomplete. If we could, for\r\ninstance, locate the other parts...\"\r\n\r\nFrank saw a little cylinder, with grey coils wrapped inside it--a power\r\nchamber, perhaps, to be lined with magnetic force, the only thing that\r\ncould contain what amounted to a tiny twenty-million degree piece of a\r\nstar's hot heart. It was a familiar principle for releasing and managing\r\nnuclear power. But the device, perhaps part of a small weapon, was\r\nsubtly marked by the differences of another technology.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I have said enough,\" Rodan stated with a thin smile. \"Though\r\nsome facts will be unavoidably obvious to you, working here. But at\r\nleast I will let you figure them out for yourselves, since you are\r\nwell-informed young men, by your own statement.\" Here Rodan looked hard\r\nat the pale, unsteady Lester. \"We will go back, now, so I can show you\r\nthe camp, its routine, and your place in it. We have three domes--garden\r\nand living quarters, with a workshop and supply dome between them...\"\r\n\r\nQuarters proved to be okay--two bunks and the usual compact accessories.\r\n\r\n\"Leave your Archers in the lockers outside your door--here are your\r\nkeys,\" Rodan suggested. \"Helen will have a meal ready for you in the\r\nadjacent dining room. Afterwards, take a helpful tranquilizer, and\r\nsleep. No work until you awaken. I shall leave you, now...\"\r\n\r\nIt was a good meal--steak cultured and grown in a nourishing solution,\r\non the Moon, perhaps at Serene, much as Dr. Alexis Carrel had long ago\r\ngrown and kept for years a living fragment of a chicken's heart.\r\nPotatoes, peas and tomatoes, too--all had become common staples in\r\nhydroponic gardens off the Earth.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of what Rodan was talking about, Les?\" Frank asked\r\nconversationally.\r\n\r\nBut David Lester was lost and vague, his food almost untouched. \"I--I\r\ndon't know!\" he stammered.\r\n\r\nScared and embittered further by this bad sign, Frank turned to Helen.\r\n\"And how are you?\" he asked hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"I am all right,\" she answered, without a trace of encouragement.\r\n\r\nShe was in jeans, maybe she was eighteen, maybe she was Rodan's\r\ndaughter. Her face was as reddened as a peasant's. It was hard to tell\r\nthat she was a girl at all. She wasn't a girl. It was soon plain that\r\nshe was a zombie with about ten words in her vocabulary. How could a\r\ngirl have gotten to this impossible region, anyway?\r\n\r\nNow Frank tried to delay Lester's inevitable complete crackup by\r\nencouraging his interest in their situation.\r\n\r\n\"It's big, Les,\" he said. \"It's got to be! An expedition came here to\r\ninvestigate the Moon--it couldn't be any more recently than sixty\r\nmillion years ago, if it was from as close as Mars, or the Asteroid\r\nPlanet! Two adjacent worlds were competing, then, the scientists know.\r\nBoth were smaller than the Earth, cooled faster, bore life sooner. Which\r\nsent the party? I saw where there rocket ship must have stood--a glassy,\r\nspot where the dust was once fused!... From all the markings, they must\r\nhave been around for months. Nowhere else on the Moon--that I ever heard\r\nof--is there anything similar left. So maybe they did most of their\r\nsurvey work by gliding, somehow, above the ground, not disturbing the\r\ndust... I think the little indentations we saw look Martian. That would\r\nbe a break! Mars still has weather. Archeological objects wouldn't stay\r\nnew there for millions of years, but here they would! Rodan is\r\nright--he's got something that'll make him famous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I think I'll have a devil-killer and hit the sack, Frank,\" Lester\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--all right,\" Frank agreed wearily. \"Me, likewise.\"\r\n\r\nFrank awoke naturally from a dreamless slumber. After a breakfast of\r\neggs that had been a powder, Lester and he were at the diggings,\r\nsifting dust for the dropped and discarded items of an alien visitation.\r\n\r\nThus Frank's job began. In the excitement of a hunt, as if for ancient\r\ntreasure, for a long time, through many ten hour shifts, Frank Nelsen\r\nfound a perhaps unfortunate Lethe of forgetfulness for his worries, and\r\nfor the mind-poisoning effects of the silence and desolation in this\r\nremote part of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThey found things, thinly scattered in the ten acre area that Rodan\r\nmeant tediously to sift. The screws and nuts, bright and new, were\r\nalmost Earthly. But would anyone ever know what the little plastic rings\r\nwere for? Or the sticks of cellulose, or the curved, wire device with\r\nfuzz at the ends? But then, would an off-Earth being ever guess the use\r\nof--say--a toothbrush or a bobbypin?\r\n\r\nThe metal cylinders, neatly cut open, might have contained food--dried\r\nleaf-like dregs still remained inside. There were small bottles made of\r\npearly glass, too--empty except for gummy traces. They were stoppered\r\nwith a stuff like rubber. There were also crumpled scraps, like paper or\r\ncellophane, most of them marked with designs or symbols.\r\n\r\nAfter ten Earth-days, in the lunar afternoon, Frank found the grave. He\r\nshouted as his brushing hands uncovered a glassy, flexible surface.\r\n\r\nRodan took charge at once. \"Back!\" he commanded. Then he was avidly busy\r\nin the pit, working as carefully as a fine jeweller. He cleared more\r\ndust away, not with a trowel, not with his gloved fingers, but with a\r\nlittle nylon brush.\r\n\r\nThe thing was like a seven-pointed star, four feet across. And was the\r\nripped, transparent casing of its body and limbs another version of a\r\nvacuum armor? The material resembled stellene. As in an Archer, there\r\nwere metal details, mechanical, electronic, and perhaps nuclear.\r\n\r\nIn the punctured covering, the corpse was dry, of course--stomach, brain\r\nsac, rough, pitted skin, terminal tendrils--some coarse, some fine,\r\nalmost, as thread, for doing the most delicate work, half out of\r\nprotecting sheaths at the ends of its arms or legs.\r\n\r\nIn the armor, the being must have walked like a toe dancer, on metal\r\nspikes. Or it might even have rolled like a wheel. The bluish tint of\r\nits crusty body had half-faded to tan. Perhaps no one would ever explain\r\nthe gaping wound that must have killed the creature, unless it had been\r\na rock fall.\r\n\r\n\"Martian!\" Lester gasped. \"At least we know that they were like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Rodan agreed softly. \"_I'll_ look after _this_ find.\"\r\n\r\nMoving very carefully, even in the weak lunar gravity, he picked up the\r\nproduct of another evolution and bore it away to the shop dome.\r\n\r\nFrank was furious. This was his discovery, and he was not even allowed\r\nto examine it.\r\n\r\nStill, something warned him not to argue. In a little while, his\r\ntreasure hunter's eagerness came back, holding out through most of that\r\nprotracted lunar night, when they worked their ten hour periods with\r\nelectric lamps attached to their shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut gradually Frank began to emerge from his single line of attention.\r\nKnowing that Lester must soon collapse, and waiting tensely for it to\r\nhappen, was part of the cause. But there was much more. There was the\r\nfact that direct radio communication with the Earth, around the curve of\r\nthe Moon, was impossible--the Tovies didn't like radio-relay orbiters,\r\nuseful for beamed, short-wave messages. They had destroyed the few\r\nunmanned ones that had been put up.\r\n\r\nThere were the several times when he had casually sent a slender beam of\r\nradio energy groping out toward Mars and the Asteroid Belt, trying to\r\ncall Storey or the Kuzaks, and had received no answer. Well, this was\r\nnot remarkable. Those regions were enormous beyond imagining; you had to\r\npinpoint your thread of tiny energy almost precisely.\r\n\r\nBut once, for an instant, while at work, he heard a voice which could be\r\nMitch Storey's, call \"Frank! Frankie!\" in his helmet phone. There was no\r\nchance for him to get an instrument-fix on the direction of the incoming\r\nwaves. And of course his name, Frank, was a common one. But an immediate\r\nattempt to beam Mars--yellow in the black sky--and its vicinity,\r\nproduced no result.\r\n\r\nHis trapped feeling increased, and nostalgia began to bore into him. He\r\nhad memories of lost sounds. Rodan tried to combat the thick silence\r\nwith taped popular music, broadcast on very low power from a field set\r\nat the diggings. But the girl voices, singing richly, only made matters\r\nworse for Frank Nelsen. And other memories piled up on him: Jarviston,\r\nMinnesota. Wind. Hay smell, car smell. Home... Cripes...! Damn...!\r\n\r\nLester's habit of muttering unintelligibly to himself was much worse,\r\nnow. Frank was expecting him to start screaming at any minute. Frank\r\nhadn't tried to talk to him much, and Lester, more introverted than\r\never, was no starter of conversations.\r\n\r\nBut now, at the sunrise--S.O.B., was it possible that they had been here\r\nalmost a month?--Frank at the diggings, indulged in some muttering,\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Frank?\" Lester asked mildly.\r\n\r\n\"Not altogether!\" Frank Nelsen snapped dryly. \"How about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I believe I'm okay at last,\" Lester replied with startling\r\nbrightness. \"I was afraid I wouldn't be. I guess I had an inferiority\r\ncomplex, and there was also something to live up to. You see, my dad was\r\nhere with the original Clifford expedition. We always agreed that I\r\nshould become a space-scientist, too. Mom went along with that--until\r\nDad was killed, here... Well, I'm over the hump, now. You see, I'm so\r\ninterested in everything around me, that the desolation has a cushion of\r\nromance that protects me. I don't see just the bleakness. I imagine the\r\nMoon as it once was, with volcanoes spitting, and with thundrous sounds\r\nin its steamy atmosphere. I see it when the Martians were here--they\r\nsurely visited Earth, too, though there all evidence weathered away. I\r\neven see the Moon as it is, now, noticing details that are easy to\r\nmiss--the little balls of ash that got stuck together by raindrops, two\r\nbillion years ago. And the pulpy, hard-shelled plants that you can still\r\nfind, alive, if you know where to look. There are some up on the ridge,\r\nwhere I often go, when offshift. Carbon dioxide and a little water vapor\r\nmust still come out of the deep crack there... Anyhow, they used to say\r\nthat a lonesome person--with perhaps a touch of schizophrenia--might do\r\nbetter off the Earth than the more usual types.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen was surprised as much by this open, self-analytical\r\nexplanation, and the clearing up of the family history behind him, as by\r\nthe miracle that had happened. Cripes, was it possible that, in his own\r\nway, Lester was more rugged than anybody else of the old Bunch? Of\r\ncourse even Lester was somewhat in wonder, himself, and had to talk it\r\nall out to somebody.\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Les,\" Nelsen enthused, relieved. \"Only--well, skip it,\r\nfor now.\"\r\n\r\nTwo work periods later, he approached Rodan. \"It will take months to\r\nsift all this dust,\" he said. \"I may not want to stay that long.\"\r\n\r\nThe pupils of Rodan's eyes flickered again. \"Oh?\" he said. \"Per\r\ncontract, you can quit anytime. But I provide no transportation. Do you\r\nwant to walk eight hundred miles--to a Tovie station? On the Moon it is\r\ndifficult to keep hired help. So one must rely on practical\r\ncounter-circumstances. Besides, I wouldn't want you to be at Serenitatis\r\nBase, or anywhere else, talking about my discovery, Nelsen. I'm afraid\r\nyou're stuck.\"\r\n\r\nNow Nelsen had the result of his perhaps incautious test statement. He\r\nknew that he was trapped by a dangerous tyrant, such as might spring up\r\nin any new, lawless country.\r\n\r\n\"It was just a thought, sir,\" he said, being as placating as he dared,\r\nand controlling his rising fury.\r\n\r\nFor there was something that hardened too quickly in Rodan. He had the\r\nfame-and-glory bug, and could be savage about it. If you wanted to get\r\naway, you had to scheme by yourself. There wasn't only Rodan to get\r\npast; there was Dutch, the big ape with the dangling pistol.\r\n\r\nNelsen decided to work quietly, as before, for a while... There were a\r\nfew more significant finds--what might have been a nuclear-operated\r\nclock, broken, of course, and some diamond drill bits. Though the long\r\nlunar day dragged intolerably, there was the paradox of time seeming to\r\nescape, too. Daylight ended with the sunset. Two weeks of darkness was\r\nno period for any moves. At sunup, a second month was almost finished!\r\nAnd ten acres of dust was less than half-sifted...\r\n\r\nIn the shop and supply dome, David Lester had been chemically analyzing\r\nthe dregs of various Martian containers for Rodan. In spare moments he\r\nclassified those scarce and incredibly hardy lunar growths that he found\r\nin the foothills of the Arabian Range. Some had hard, bright-green\r\ntendrils, that during daylight, opened out of woody shells full of\r\nspongy hollows as an insulation against the fearsome cold of night. Some\r\nwere so small that they could only be seen under a microscope. Frank's\r\ninterest, here, however, palled quickly. And Lester, in his mumbling,\r\nstudious preoccupation, was no companionable antidote for loneliness.\r\n\r\nFrank tried a new approach on Helen, who really was Rodan's daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like poetry, Helen? I used to memorize Keats, Frost,\r\nShakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nThey were there in the dining room. She brightened a little. \"I\r\nremember--some.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember clouds, the sound of water? Trees, grass...?\"\r\n\r\nShe actually smiled, wistfully. \"Yes. Sunday afternoons. A blue dress.\r\nMy mother when she was alive... A dog I had, once...\"\r\n\r\nHelen Rodan wasn't quite a zombie, after all. Maybe he could win her\r\nconfidence, if he went slow...\r\n\r\nBut twenty hours later, at the diggings, when Dutch stumbled over\r\nFrank's sifter, she reverted. \"I'll learn you to leave junk in my way,\r\nyou greenhorn squirt!\" Dutch shouted. Then he tossed Frank thirty feet.\r\nFrank came back, kicked him in his thinly armored stomach, knocked him\r\ndown, and tried to get his gun. But Dutch grabbed him in those big arms.\r\nHelen was also pointing a small pistol at him.\r\n\r\nShe was trembling. \"Dad will handle this,\" she said.\r\n\r\nRodan came over. \"You don't have much choice, do you, Nelsen?\" he\r\nsneered. \"However, perhaps Dutch was crude. I apologize for him. And I\r\nwill deduct a hundred dollars from his pay, and give it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged,\" Frank said dryly.\r\n\r\nAfter that, everything happened to build his tensions to the breaking\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAt a work period's end, near the lunar noon, he heard a voice in his\r\nhelmet-phone. \"Frank--this is Two-and-Two...! Why don't you ever call or\r\nanswer...?\"\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two's usually plaintive voice had a special quality, as if he\r\nwas maybe in trouble. This time, Frank got a directional fix, adjusted\r\nhis antenna, and called, \"Hey, Two-and-Two...! Hey, Pal--it's me--Frank\r\nNelsen...!\"\r\n\r\nVenus was in the sky, not too close to the sun. But still, though Nelsen\r\ncalled repeatedly, there was no reply.\r\n\r\nHe got back to quarters, and looked over not only his radio but his\r\nentire Archer. The radio had been fiddled with, delicately; it would\r\nstill work, but not in a narrow enough beam to reach millions of miles,\r\nor even five hundred. An intricate focusing device had been removed from\r\na wave guide.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't the worst that was wrong with the Archer. The small nuclear\r\nbattery which energized the moisture-reclaimer, the heating units, and\r\nespecially the air-restorer--not only for turning its pumps but for\r\nproviding the intense internal illumination necessary to promote the\r\nrelease of oxygen in the photosynthetic process of the chlorophane when\r\nthere was no sun--had been replaced by a chemical battery of a far\r\nsmaller active life-span! The armor locker! Rodan had extra keys, and\r\ncould tamper and make replacements, any time he considered it necessary.\r\n\r\nLester had wandered afield, somewhere. When he showed up, Nelsen jarred\r\nhim out of his studious preoccupations long enough for them both to\r\nexamine his armor. Same, identical story.\r\n\r\n\"Rodan made sure,\" Frank gruffed. \"That S.O.B. put us on a real short\r\ntether!\"\r\n\r\nDavid Lester looked frightened for a minute. Then he seemed to ease.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it doesn't make any difference,\" he said. \"Though I'd like to\r\ncall my mother... But I'm doing things that I like. After a while, when\r\nthe job is finished, he'll let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" Frank breathed.\r\n\r\nThere was the big question. Nelsen figured that an old, corny pattern\r\nstuck out all over Rodan. Personal glory emphasized to a point where it\r\ngot beyond sense. And wouldn't that unreason be more likely to get worse\r\nin the terrible lunar desert than it ever would on Earth?\r\n\r\nWould Rodan ever release them? Wouldn't he fear encroachment on his\r\narcheological success, even after all his data had been made public?\r\nThis was all surmise-prediction, of course, but his extreme precautions,\r\nalready taken, did not look good. On the Moon there could easily be an\r\narranged accident, killing Lester, and him--Frank Nelsen--and maybe even\r\nDutch. Rodan's pupils had that nervous way of expanding and contracting\r\nrapidly, too. Nelsen figured that he might be reading the signs somewhat\r\nwarpedly himself. Still...?\r\n\r\nAt the end of another shift, Nelsen took a walk, farther than ever\r\nbefore, up through a twisted pass that penetrated to the other side of\r\nthe Arabian Mountains. He still had that much freedom. He wanted to\r\nthink things out. In bitter, frustrating reversal of all his former\r\nurges to get off the Earth, he wanted, like a desperate weakling, to be\r\nback home.\r\n\r\nUp beyond the Arabians, he saw the tread marks of a small tractor\r\nvehicle in a patch of dust. There was a single boot print. A short\r\ndistance farther on, there was another. He examined them with a\r\nquizzical excitement. But there weren't any more. For miles, ahead and\r\nbehind, unimpressable lava rock extended.\r\n\r\nAnother curious thing happened, only minutes later. A thousand miles\r\noverhead, out of reach of his sabotaged transmitter, one of those around\r\nthe Moon tour bubbs, like the unfortunate _Far Side_, was passing. He\r\nheard the program they were broadcasting. A male voice crooned out what\r\nmust be a new, popular song. He had heard so few new songs.\r\n\r\n\"Serene...\r\n\r\nFound a queen...\r\n\r\nAnd her name is Eileen...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen's reaction wasn't even a thought, at first; it was only an eerie\r\ntingle in all his flesh. Then, realizing what his suspicion was, he\r\nlistened further, with all his nerves taut. But no explanation of the\r\nsong's origin was given... He even tried futilely to radio the pleasure\r\nbubb, full of Earth tourists. In minutes it had sunk behind the abrupt\r\nhorizon, leaving him with his unanswered wonder.\r\n\r\nGirls, he thought, in the midst of his utter solitude. All girls, to\r\nlove and have ... Eileen? Cripes, could it be little old Eileen Sands,\r\nup on her ballet-dancing toes, sometimes, at Hendricks', and humming\r\nherself a tune? Eileen who had deserted the Bunch, meaning to approach\r\nspace in a feminine way? Holy cow, had even _she_ gotten _that_ far, so\r\nfast?\r\n\r\nSuddenly the possibility became a symbol of what the others of the\r\nBunch must be accomplishing, while here he was, trapped, stuck futilely,\r\ninside a few bleak square miles on the far side of Earth's own\r\nsatellite!\r\n\r\nSo here was another force of Frank Nelsen's desperation.\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind--which perhaps just then was a bit mad.\r\n\r\nWith outward calm he returned to camp, slept, worked, slept and worked\r\nagain. He decided that there was no help to be had from Lester, who was\r\nstill no man of action. Better to work alone, anyway.\r\n\r\nFortunately, on the Moon, it was easy to call deadly forces to one's\r\naid. Something as simple as possible, the trick should be. Of course all\r\nhe wanted to do was to get the upper hand on Rodan and Dutch, take over\r\nthe camp, get the missing parts of his radio and Archer, borrow the\r\nsolar tractor, and get out of here. To Serenitatis Base--Serene.\r\n\r\nHis only preparation was to sharpen the edges of a diamond-shaped trowel\r\nused at the diggings, with a piece of pumice. Then he waited.\r\n\r\nOpportunity came near sundown, after a shift. Rodan, Dutch, and he had\r\ncome into the supply and shop dome, through its airlock. Lester and\r\nHelen--these two introverts had somehow discovered each other, and were\r\ngetting along well together--were visible through the transparent wall,\r\nlingering at the diggings.\r\n\r\nNelsen saw Rodan and Dutch unlatch the collars of their helmets,\r\npreparatory for removing them, as they usually did if they stayed here a\r\nwhile, to pack new artifacts or stow tools. Nelsen made as if to unlatch\r\nhis collar, too. But if he did it, the gasket would be unsealed, and his\r\nhelmet would no longer be airtight.\r\n\r\nNow!--he told himself. Or would it be better to wait fourteen more\r\nEarth-days, till another lunar dawn? Hell no--that would be chickenish\r\nprocrastination. Rodan and Dutch were a good ten feet away from him--he\r\nwas out of their reach.\r\n\r\nWith the harmless-looking trowel held like a dagger, he struck with all\r\nhis might at the stellene outer wall of the dome, and then made a\r\nripping motion. Like a monster gasping for breath, the imprisoned air\r\nsighed out.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the moment when Rodan's and Dutch's hands moved in\r\nlife-saving instinct to reseal their collars, Frank Nelsen leaped, and\r\nthen kicked twice, as hard as he could, in rapid succession. At Dutch's\r\nstomach, first. Then Rodan's.\r\n\r\nThey were down--safe from death, since they had managed to re-latch\r\ntheir collars. But with a cold fury that had learned to take no chances\r\nwith defeat, Nelsen proceeded to kick them again, first one and then\r\nthe other, meaning to make them insensible.\r\n\r\nHe got Dutch's pistol. He was a shade slow with Rodan. \"You won't get\r\nanything that is mine!\" he heard Rodan grunt.\r\n\r\nFrank managed to deflect the automatic's muzzle from himself. But Rodan\r\nmoved it downward purposefully, lined it up on a box marked dynamite,\r\nand fired.\r\n\r\nNelsen must have thrown himself prone at the last instant, before the\r\nticklish explosive blew. He saw the flash and felt the dazing thud,\r\nthough most of the blast passed over him. Results far outstripped the\r\nmost furious intention of his plan, and became, not freedom, but a\r\nthreat of slow dying, an ordeal, as the sagging dome was torn from above\r\nhim, and supplies, air-restorer equipment, water and oxygen flasks, the\r\nvitals and the batteries of the solar-electric plant--all for the most\r\npart hopelessly shattered--were hurled far and wide, along with the\r\nrelics from Mars. The adjacent garden and quarters domes were also\r\nshredded and swept away.\r\n\r\nDazed, Nelsen still got Rodan's automatic, picked himself up, saw that\r\nDutch and Rodan, in armor, too, had apparently suffered from the\r\nexplosion no worse than had he. He glanced at the hole in the lava rock,\r\nstill smoking in the high vacuum. Most of the force of the blast had\r\ngone upward. He looked at Helen's toppled tomatoes and petunias--yes,\r\npetunias--where the garden dome had been. Oddly, they didn't wilt at\r\nonce, though the little water in the hydroponic troughs was boiling away\r\nfuriously, making frosty rainbows in the slanting light of the sun.\r\nFragments of a solar lamp, to keep the plants growing at night, lay in\r\nthe shambles.\r\n\r\nRodan and Dutch were pretty well knocked out from Frank Nelsen's\r\nfootwork. Now Dave Lester and Helen Rodan came running. Lester's face\r\nwas all stunned surprise. Helen was yelling.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you do it--you--murderer!\"\r\n\r\nWhen she kneeled beside her father, Frank got her gun, too. He felt an\r\nawful regret for a plan whose results far surpassed his intentions, but\r\nthere was no good in showing it, now. Someone had to be in command in a\r\nsituation which already looked black.\r\n\r\n\"Frank--I didn't suppose--\" Lester stammered. \"Now--what are we going to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that we can do--try to get out of here!\" Frank snapped back at him.\r\n\r\nWith some shreds of stellene, he tied Dutch's arms behind his back, and\r\nlashed his feet together. Then he pulled Helen away from Rodan.\r\n\r\n\"Hold her, Les,\" he ordered. \"Maybe I overplayed my hand, but just the\r\nsame, I still think I'm the best to say what's to be done and maybe get\r\nus out of a jam, and I can't have Helen or Rodan or anybody else doing\r\nany more cockeyed things to screw matters up even worse than they are.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen trussed Rodan up, too, then searched Rodan's thigh pouch and\r\nfound a bunch of keys.\r\n\r\n\"You come along with me, Les and Helen,\" he said. \"First we'll find out\r\nwhat we've got left to work with.\"\r\n\r\nHe investigated the rocket. That the blast had toppled it over, wasn't\r\nthe worst. When he unlocked its servicing doors, he found that Rodan had\r\nremoved a vital part from the nuclear exciters of the motors. His and\r\nLester's blastoff drums were still in the freight compartment, but the\r\nionics and air-restorers had been similarly rendered unworkable. Their\r\noxygen and water flasks were gone. Only their bubbs were intact, but\r\nthere was nothing with which to inflate them.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank examined the sun-powered tractor, he found that tiny platinum\r\nplates had been taken from the thermocouple units. It was clear that,\r\nwith paranoid thoroughness, Rodan had concentrated all capacity to move\r\nfrom the camp's vicinity in himself. He had probably locked up the\r\nmissing items in the supply dome, and now the exploding dynamite had\r\nruined them.\r\n\r\nExploring the plain, Nelsen even found quite a few of the absent parts,\r\nall useless. Only one oxygen flask and one water flask remained intact.\r\nHere was a diabolical backfiring of schemes, all around.\r\n\r\nReturning to Rodan and Dutch, he examined their Archers through their\r\nservicing ports. Rodan's was as the manufacturer intended it. But\r\nDutch's was jimmied the same as his and Lester's.\r\n\r\nNelsen swung Helen around to face him, and unlatched a port at her\r\nArcher's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"He put even you on a short string, kid,\" he pronounced bitterly, after\r\na moment. \"Well, at least we can give you his nuclear battery for a\r\nwhile, and let him have his chemical cell back.\"\r\n\r\nHelen seemed about to attack him. But then her look wavered; confusion\r\nand pain came into her face.\r\n\r\nNelsen was aware that he was doing almost all of the talking, but maybe\r\nthis had to be.\r\n\r\n\"So we've got a long walk,\" he said. \"Toward the Tovie settlement. In\r\nArchers of mostly much-reduced range. Whose fault the situation is,\r\ncan't change anything a bit. This is a life-or-death proposition, with\r\nlasting-time the most important factor. So let's get started. Has\r\nanybody got any suggestions to increase our chances?\"\r\n\r\nBoth Rodan and Dutch had come to. Rodan said nothing. His look was pure\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nDutch sneered. \"Smart damn kid you are, huh, Nelsen? _You think!_ Wait\r\ntill you and your mumblin' crackpot pal get out there! I'll watch both\r\nof you go bust, squirt!\"\r\n\r\nLester seemed not to hear these remarks. \"All that gypsum, Frank,\" he\r\nsaid. \"The water-and-oxygen mineral. But this is for real. There's no\r\ngimmick--no energy-source--to release it and save us...\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen untied Rodan's and Dutch's feet, and, at pistol point,\r\nordered them to move out ahead. From the charts he knew the\r\nbearing--straight toward the constellation Cassiopeia, at this hour,\r\nacross an arm of Mare Nova, then along a pass that cut through the\r\nmountains. Eight hundred hopeless miles...! Well, how did he know,\r\nreally? How much could a human body take? How fast could they go? How\r\nlong would the chemical batteries actually last? What breaks _might_\r\nappear?\r\n\r\nThey loped along, even Rodan hurrying. They made a hundred miles in the\r\nhours before darkness. With just Helen's shoulder lamp showing the way,\r\nthey continued onward through the mountains.\r\n\r\nWas there truly much to tell, in that slow, losing struggle? Nelsen\r\nattached the oxygen flask to his air system for a while, relieving the\r\ndrain on his battery. Then he gave the flask to Lester. Later he began\r\nto move the nuclear battery around to all the Archers, to conserve all\r\nof the other batteries a little. Soon they filled the drinking-water\r\ntanks of their armor, so that they could discard the flask, whose slight\r\nweight seemed to have tripled.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty hours, the power of the chemical batteries began to wane.\r\nDavid Lester, hovering close to Helen, muttered to himself, or to her.\r\nRodan, still marching quite strongly, retreated into an unreality of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"Have another scotch on the rocks, Ralph,\" he said genially. \"I knew I'd\r\nmake it... Nobel Prize... Oh, you have no idea what I went through...\r\nMost of my staff dead... But it's over, now, Ralph... Another good,\r\nstomach-warming scotch...\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn, loony squirt's crackin' up!\" Dutch screamed suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe began to run, promptly falling into a volcanic crack, the bottom of\r\nwhich couldn't even be found with the light. Fortunately he wasn't\r\nwearing the nuclear battery just then.\r\n\r\nSomehow, Lester remained cool. It was as if, with everyone else scared,\r\ntoo, and nobody to show superior courage, he had found himself.\r\n\r\nThe batteries waned further. The cold of the inky lunar night--much\r\nworse than that of interplanetary space, where there is practically\r\nalways sunshine, began to bite through the insulation of the Archers,\r\nand power couldn't be wasted on the heating coils.\r\n\r\nWorst was the need for rest. They all lay down at last, except Frank\r\nNelsen, who moved around, clipping the nuclear battery into one Archer\r\nfor a minute, to freshen the air, and then into another. It was the only\r\ntrick--or gimmick--that they found. After a while, Lester made the\r\nrounds, while Nelsen rested.\r\n\r\nThey got a few more miles by swapping batteries in quick succession. But\r\nthe accumulating carbon dioxide in the air they breathed, made them\r\nsleepier. They had to sit down, then lie down. Frank figured that they\r\nhad come something over a quarter of the eight hundred miles. This was\r\nabout the end of Frank Nelsen, would-be Planet Strapper from Jarviston,\r\nMinnesota. Well--his coffin would be a common one--an Archer Five...\r\nSomehow, he thought of a line from Kipling: \"If you can keep your head\r\nwhen all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you...\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to clip the nuclear battery back in Helen's armor, again. She\r\n_might_ make the remaining five hundred-something miles, alone...! He\r\njust barely managed to accomplish it... There was still a little juice,\r\nfrom his chemical cell, feeding his helmet phone... Now, he thought he\r\nheard someone singing raucously one of those improvised doggerel songs\r\nof spacemen and Moonmen... Folklore, almost...\r\n\r\n\"If this goddam dust\r\n\r\nJust holds its crust,\r\n\r\nI'll get on to hell\r\n\r\nIf my gear don't bust...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Nelsen gurgled thickly into his phone. \"Hey...\" Then it was as if\r\nhe sort of sank...\r\n\r\nHell was real, all right, because, with needles in his eyes and all\r\nthrough his body, Nelsen seemed to be goaded on by imps to crawl, in\r\ninfinite weariness, through a hot steel pipe, to face Old Nick\r\nhimself--or was it somebody he'd met before?\r\n\r\nMaybe he asked, because he got an answer--from the grinning, freckled\r\nface bending over him, as he lay, armorless, on a sort of pallet, under\r\nthe taut stellene roof of a Moontent.\r\n\r\n\"Sure Frankie--me, Gimp Hines, the itinerant trader and repairman of the\r\nlunar wilderness... What a switch--didn't think _you'd_ goof! The\r\nBunch--especially Two-and-Two--couldn't contact you. So I was sort of\r\nlooking, knowing about where you'd be. Just made it in time. Les and the\r\ngirl, and that ornery professor-or-whatever, are right here, too--still\r\nknocked out with a devil-killer. You've been out twenty hours, yourself.\r\nI'll fill you in on the news. Just shut up and drink up. Good Earth\r\nwhiskey--a hundred bucks just to shoot a fifth into orbit.\"\r\n\r\nFrank gulped and coughed. \"Thanks, Gimp.\" His voice was like pumice.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, I said!\" Gimp ordered arrogantly. \"About me--first. When I got\r\nto Serene, I could have convinced them I was worth a job. But I'm\r\nindependent. I hocked my gear, bought some old parts, built myself a\r\ntractor and trailer, loaded it with water, oxygen, frozen vegetables,\r\nspare parts, cigarettes, pin-up pictures, liquor and so forth, and came\r\ntravelling. I didn't forget tools. You'd be astonished by what you can\r\nsell and fix--and for what prices--out in the isolated areas, or what\r\nyou can bring back. I even got a couple of emeralds as big as pigeon\r\neggs. I'm getting myself a reputation, besides. What difference does\r\njust one good leg make--at only one-sixth Earth grav? You still hop\r\nalong, even when you don't ride. And everywhere I go, I leave that left\r\nboot print behind in the dust, like a record that could last a thousand\r\nages. I'm getting to be Left Foot, the legend.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen cleared his throat, found his voice. \"Cocky, aren't you, Pal?\" he\r\nchuckled. So another thing was happening in reverse from what most\r\npeople had expected. Gimp Hines was finding a new, surer self, off the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Gimp,\" Nelsen added. \"I figured that I saw your tracks\r\nand your tractor tread marks, up in the hills, just before I decided to\r\nbreak away from Rodan...\"\r\n\r\nThen he was telling the whole story.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was there,\" Gimp said at the end. \"I missed you on the first\r\npass, prospected for a couple of Earth-days, found a small copper\r\ndeposit. High ground gave me a good position to receive short-wave\r\nmessages--thought I heard your voices a couple of times. So I doubled\r\nback, and located what is left of Rodan's camp, and yours and Les'\r\ninitialed blastoff drums, which I've brought along in my trailer. Lucky\r\na trader needs an atom-powered tractor that can move at night. I\r\nfollowed your tracks, though going through rough country, you were\r\nscreened from my radio calls until I was almost on you. Though on my\r\nfirst pass, when you were still in camp, I guess I could have reached\r\nyou by bouncing a beam off a mountain top, had I known... Well, it\r\ndoesn't matter, now. I'm out of stock, again, and full of money--got to\r\nhead back to Serene... You were trying for the Tovie station, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see what you mean, Frank. If you could have made it, and missed\r\ngetting shot by some trigger-happy guard--where a frontier isn't even\r\nsupposed to exist--they probably would have held you for a while, and\r\nthen let you go.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the rest of the Bunch?\" Frank Nelsen prompted.\r\n\r\n\"The Kuzaks got to the Belt okay--though they had to fight off some\r\nrough and humorous characters. Storey reached his Mars. Charlie Reynolds\r\nand Two-and-Two got to Venus, and hooked up with the exploring\r\nexpedition. Tiflin? Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ramos?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--a real disappointing case, Frank. Darn wild idiot who ought to be\r\nprobing the farther reaches of the solar system, got himself a job in a\r\nchemical plant in Serene. A synthesizing retort exploded. He was burned\r\npretty bad. Just out of the hospital when I last left. It was on account\r\nof a woman that he was on the Moon at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eileen, the Queen of Serene? Gimp!--is _that_ so, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep--sort of. Our Eileen. Back in Jarviston, Ramos found out that she\r\nwas there. She's a good kid. Even admits that she hasn't got much\r\ncompetition, on a mostly--yet--masculine world... Well, I guess we start\r\nrolling, eh? I didn't want to jolt any of you poor sick people, so I\r\ncamped. Let's get you all into Archers, for which I have a few spare\r\nparts left. Then, after we roll up this sealed, air-conditioned tent of\r\na familiar material, we can be on our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just let's watch Rodan--that's all,\" Frank Nelsen warned.\r\n\r\n\"Sure--we'll keep him good and dopey with a tranquilizer...\"\r\n\r\nThey aroused Dave Lester and Helen Rodan, helped them armor up,\r\nexplained briefly what the situation was, stuffed Xavier Rodan into his\r\nArcher, and climbed with him into the sealable cab of the tractor. Here\r\nthey could all remove their helmets.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours of bumping over rugged country, with the tractor's\r\nheadlights blazing through the star-topped blackness, they reached a\r\nsolid trail over a mare. Then they could zip along, almost like on a\r\nhighway. There were other rough stretches, but most of the well selected\r\nroute was smooth. Half the time, Nelsen drove, while Gimp rested or\r\nslept. They ate spaceman's gruel, heated on a little electric stove. And\r\nafter a certain number of hours, they climbed over the side of the Moon,\r\nand made their own sunrise. After that, the going seemed easier.\r\n\r\nGimp and Frank were just about talked out, by then. Helen Rodan looked\r\nafter her slumbering father. Otherwise, she and Lester seemed wrapped up\r\nin each other. Frank hardly listened to the few words they exchanged.\r\nThey kept peering eagerly and worriedly along the trail, that wound\r\npast fantastic scenery.\r\n\r\nNelsen was eager and tense, himself. Serene, he was thinking with\r\ngratitude. Back to some of civilization. Back to freedom--if there\r\nwasn't too much trouble on account of all that had happened. Speeding\r\nalong, they passed the first scattered domes, a hydroponic garden, an\r\nisolated sun-power plant.\r\n\r\nIt was another hour before they reached the checking-gate of one of the\r\nmain airlocks. Frank Nelsen didn't try any tricks before the\r\nwhite-armored international guards.\r\n\r\n\"There have been some difficulties,\" he said. \"I think you will want all\r\nof our names.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Helen Rodan,\" Helen interrupted. \"My father, Xavier Rodan, here,\r\nis sick. He needs a hospital. I will stay with him. These are our\r\nfriends. They brought us all the way from Far Side.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the broad airlock compartment, Lester also got down from the\r\ntractor. \"I'll stay, too,\" he said. \"Go ahead, Frank. You and Gimp have\r\nhad enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"A moment,\" gruffed one of the guards with a slight accent. \"We shall\r\nsay who shall do what--passing this lock. Difficulties? Very well.\r\nNames, and space-fitness cards, please, from everybody. And where you\r\nwill be staying, here in Serene...\"\r\n\r\nGimp and Frank got permission to pass the lock after about fifteen\r\nminutes. Without Helen and Les agreeing to stay, it might have been\r\ntougher. They spoke their thanks. For the time being, Frank was free to\r\nbreathe open air under big, stellene domes. But he didn't know in what\r\nweb of questioning and accusation he might soon be entangled.\r\n\r\nLooking back to his first action against Rodan--with a sharpened trowel\r\nthat had pierced the wall of a stellene dome--eventually leading up to\r\nDutch's death, and very nearly precipitating his own demise and that of\r\nhis other companions, he wondered if it wouldn't be regarded as\r\ncriminal. Now he wasn't absolutely sure, himself, that it hadn't been\r\ncriminal--or Moonmad. Yet he didn't hate Xavier Rodan any less.\r\n\r\n\"The S.O.B. might just get sent to a mental hospital--at the worst,\"\r\nGimp growled loyally. \"Well, come on, Frank--let's forget it, ditch our\r\nArchies at the Hostel, get a culture steak, and look around to see what\r\nyou've missed...\"\r\n\r\nSo that was how Frank Nelsen began to get acquainted with\r\nSerene--fifteen thousand population, much of it habitually transient; a\r\ntown of vast aspirations, careful discipline, little spotless cubicles\r\nfor living quarters, pay twenty dollars a day just for the air you\r\nbreathe, Earth-beer twenty dollars a can, a dollar if synthesized\r\nlocally. Hydroponic sunflowers, dahlias, poppies, tomatoes, cabbages,\r\nall grown enormous in this slight gravity. New chemical-synthesis\r\nplants, above ground and far below; metal refineries, shops making\r\nelectronic and nuclear devices, and articles of fabric, glass, rubber,\r\nplastic, magnesium. A town of supply warehouses and tanks around a great\r\nspace port; a town of a thousand unfinished enterprises, and as many\r\nparadoxes and inconveniencies. No water in fountains, water in toilets\r\nonly during part of an Earth-day. English, French, Spanish, German,\r\nGreek and Arabic spoken, to mention a few of the languages. An\r\nastronomical observatory; a selenographic museum, already open, though\r\nless than half completed. And of course it was against the law not to\r\nwork for more than seventy-two consecutive hours. And over the whole\r\nsetup there seemed to hang the question: Can Man really live in space,\r\nor does his invasion of it signal his final downfall?\r\n\r\nAt a certain point, Nelsen gave up trying to figure out all of the\r\naspects of Serene. Of course he and Gimp had one inevitable goal. There\r\nwas a short walk, Gimp hopping along lightly; then there was an elevator\r\nride downward, for the place, aggressively named _The First Stop_, was\r\nnestled cosily in the lava-rock underlying the dust of Mare Serenitatis.\r\n\r\nIt had an arched interior, bar, stage, blaring jukebox, tables, and a\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder press of tough men, held in curious orderliness in\r\npart by the rigid caution needed in their dangerous and artificial\r\nexistences, in part by the presence of police, and in part perhaps by a\r\nkind of stored-up awe and tenderness for girls--all girls--who had been\r\nout of their lives for too long. In a way, it was a crude, tawdry joint;\r\nbut it was not the place that Frank and Gimp--or even many of the\r\nothers--had come to see.\r\n\r\nEileen Sands was there, dancing crazy, swoopy stuff, possible at lunar\r\ngravity, as Frank and Gimp entered. Her costume was no feminine fluff;\r\ncheesecake, of which she presumably didn't have much, was not on\r\ndisplay, either. Dungarees, still? No, not quite. Slender black\r\ntrousers, like some girls use for ballet practice, instead.\r\n\r\nMaybe she wasn't terribly good, or sufficiently drilled, yet, in her\r\nroutines. But she had a pert, appealing face, a quick smile; her hair\r\nwas brushed close to her head. She was a cute, utterly bold pixy to\r\nremember smiling at you--just you--like a spirit of luck and love, far\r\nout in the thick silence.\r\n\r\nHer caper ended. She was puffing and laughing and bowing--and maybe\r\nsweating, some, besides. The clapping was thunderous. She came out again\r\nand sang _Fire Streak_ in a haunting, husky voice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a barman touched Frank's and Gimp's shoulders. \"Hines and\r\nNelsen? She has spotted you two. She wants to see you in her quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, lads,\" she laughed. \"Beer for old times?... You look like hell,\r\nFrank. Brief me on the missing chapter. You had everybody scared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-uh--you first, Your Majesty,\" Nelsen chuckled in return.\r\n\r\nShe wrinkled her nose at him. \"Well, I got here. There was a need.\r\nSomebody decided that I was the best available talent. This is the first\r\nstep. Maybe I'll have my own spot--bigger and better. Or get back to my\r\nown regular self, working Out There with the men.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe it was bad taste, but Nelsen felt like teasing. \"Ever hear of a\r\nperson named Miguel Ramos?\"\r\n\r\nThat didn't bother her. She shrugged. \"Still around, though I hope not\r\nfor long, the buffoon! Who could ever put up with a show-off small boy\r\nlike that for more than ten minutes? Besides, he's wasting himself. Why\r\nshould he pick me for a bad influence...? Now, your chapter, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nHe told her the story, briefly.\r\n\r\nAt last she said, \"Frank, you must be spiritually all jammed up. Gimp is\r\nset, I know...\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more, Eileen introduced him to a girl. Jennie Harper\r\nhad large dark eyes, and a funny, achy sort of voice. Gimp disappeared\r\ndiscreetly with his date. Frank and Jennie sat at a table in a private\r\nbooth, high up in the arches of _The First Stop_, and watched Eileen do\r\nanother number.\r\n\r\nJennie explained herself. \"I'm another one. I've got to go where the\r\nheroes go. That's me--Frankie, is it? So I'm here...\"\r\n\r\nShe had a perfume. While he was Rodan's prisoner for two and a half\r\nmonths, there were special things that had driven him almost wild. Now\r\nhe made hints, inevitably.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need Eileen to tell me you're a good guy, Frank,\" she said with\r\na small, warm smile. \"We're just entertainers. They wouldn't let us be\r\nanything else--here...\"\r\n\r\nIt hardly mattered what else they said. Maybe it was fifteen hours later\r\nthat Frank Nelsen found himself walking along a stellene-covered\r\ncauseway, looking for Left Foot Gimp Hines. He had memories of a tiny\r\nroom, very neat and compact, with even a single huge rose in a vase on\r\nthe bed table. But the time had a fierce velvet-softness that tried to\r\ndraw him to it forevermore. It was like the grip of home, and the lost\r\nEarth, and the fear that he would chicken out and return.\r\n\r\nHe found Gimp, who seemed worried. \"You might get stuck, here, on\r\naccount of Rodan,\" he said. \"Even I might. We'd better go see.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen had bitter, vengeful thoughts of Rodan being set at liberty--with\r\nhimself the culprit.\r\n\r\nThe official at the police building was an American--a gruff one, but\r\nhuman. \"I got the dope from the girl, Nelsen,\" he said. \"And from\r\nLester. You're lucky. Rodan confessed to a murder--another\r\nemployee--just before he hired you. Apparently just before he made his\r\ndiscovery. He was afraid that the kid would try to horn in. Oh, he's not\r\ninsane--not enough to escape punishment, anyhow. Here the official means\r\nof execution is simple exposure to the vacuum. Now, if you want to leave\r\nSerene, you'd better do so soon, before somebody decides to subpoena you\r\nas a witness...\"\r\n\r\nFrank felt a humbled wonder. Was Rodan really accountable, or was it the\r\nMoon and space, working on people's emotions?\r\n\r\nLeaving the building, Frank and Gimp found Dave Lester and Helen Rodan\r\nentering. They talked for a moment. Then Lester said:\r\n\r\n\"Helen's had lots of trouble. And we're in love. What do we do, guys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunno--get married?\" Nelsen answered, shrugging. \"It must happen here,\r\ntoo. Oh, I get it--living costs, off the Earth, are high. Well--I've got\r\nwhat Helen's father paid me. Of course I have to replace the missing\r\nparts of my equipment. But I'll loan you five hundred. Wish it could be\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks, I can do better,\" Gimp joined in. \"Pay us sometime, when you\r\nsee us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know...\" Lester protested worriedly, like an honest man.\r\n\r\nBut Gimp and Frank were already shelling out bills, like vagabonds who\r\nhappened to be flush.\r\n\r\n\"Poor simpletons,\" Gimp wailed facetiously afterwards, when they had\r\nmoved out of earshot. \"Even here, it happens. But that's worse. And if\r\nher Daddy had stayed human, she might almost have been an heiress...\r\nWell, come on, Frank. I've got my space gear out of hock, and my tractor\r\nsold. And an old buddy of ours is waiting for us at a repair and\r\noutfitting shop near the space port. I hope we didn't jump the gun,\r\nassuming you want to get out into the open again, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't,\" Nelsen answered. \"You sure you don't want to look at\r\nRodan's site--see if we can find any more Martian stuff?\"\r\n\r\nGimp looked regretful for a second. \"Uh-uh--it's jinxed,\" he said.\r\n\r\nRamos, scarred, somewhat, along the neck and left cheek, and a bit stiff\r\nof shoulder, was rueful but very eager. Frank's gutted gear was out of\r\nthe blastoff drum, and spread around the shop. Most of it was already\r\nfixed. Ramos had been helping.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frankie--here's one loose goose who is really glad to be leaving\r\nLuna,\" he said. \"Are the asteroids all right with you for a start?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" Nelsen told him.\r\n\r\n\"Passing close to Mars, which is lined up orbitally along our route,\"\r\nGimp put in. \"Did you beam Two-and-Two and Charlie on Venus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh--they're just kind of bored,\" Ramos said. \"I even got Storey at\r\nthe Martian Survey Station. But he's going out into those lousy\r\nthickets, again. Old Paul, in Jarviston, sounds the same. Can't get him\r\nright now--North America is turned away... I couldn't pinpoint the\r\nKuzaks in the Belt, but that's not unusual.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll finance a load of trade stuff for them,\" Gimp chuckled. \"We ought\r\nto be able to move out in about five hours, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Should,\" Ramos agreed. \"Weapons--we might need 'em this trip--and\r\neverything else is about ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we'll get a good meal, and then buy our load,\" Frank enthused.\r\n\r\nHe felt the texture of his deflated bubb. The hard lines of deep-space\r\nequipment quickened his pulses. He forgot the call of Earth. He felt as\r\nfree and easy as a hobo with cosmic dust in his hair.\r\n\r\nBlastoff from Serene's port, even with three heavily loaded trader\r\nrockets, was comparatively easy and inexpensive.\r\n\r\nOut in orbit, three reunited Bunch members inflated and rigged their\r\nbubbs. For Nelsen it seemed an old, splendid feeling. They lashed the\r\nsupplies from the trader rockets into great bundles that they could tow.\r\n\r\nBefore the rockets began to descend, the trio of beautiful, fragile\r\nrings, pushed by ions streaming from their centers, started to\r\naccelerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's the life of Reilly, Paul,\" Ramos was beaming back to Jarviston,\r\nMinnesota, not many hours after Frank Nelsen, Gimp Hines and he started\r\nout from the Moon, with their ultimate destination--after the delivery\r\nof their loads of supplies to the Kuzaks--tentatively marked in their\r\nminds as Pallastown on Pallas, the Golden Asteroid.\r\n\r\nRamos was riding a great bale, drawn by his spinning and still\r\naccelerating ring, to the hub of which it was attached by a thin steel\r\ncable, passed through a well-oiled swivel bolt. One of his booted feet\r\nwas hooked under a bale lashing, to keep him from drifting off in the\r\nabsence of weight. He held a rifle casually, but at alert, across his\r\nknees. Its needle-like bullets were not intended to kill. They were tiny\r\nrockets that could flame during the last second of a long flight, homing\r\nin on a target by means of a self-contained and marvelously miniaturized\r\nradar guidance system. Their tips were anesthetic.\r\n\r\nThe parabolic antenna mounted on the elbow of Ramos' Archer, swung a\r\ntiny bit, holding the beam contact with Paul Hendricks automatically,\r\nafter it was made. Yet Ramos kept his arm very still, to avoid making\r\nthe slender beam swing wide. Meanwhile, he was elaborating on his first\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"... Not like before. No terrestrial ground-to-orbit weight problem to\r\nbeat, this trip, Paul. And we've got some of about everything that the\r\nMoon could provide, thanks to Gimp, who paid the bill. Culture steak in\r\nthe shadow refrigerators. That's all you need, Out Here, to keep things\r\nfrozen--just a shadow... We've got hydroponic vegetables, tinned bread,\r\nchocolate, beer. We've got sun stoves to cook on. We've got numerous\r\nluxury items not meant for the stomach. We're living high for a while,\r\nanyhow. Of course we don't want to use up too much of the fancy stuff.\r\nTell Otto Kramer about us...\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen and Gimp Hines, who were riding the rigging of their\r\nrespective bubbs, which were also hauling big bales of supplies, were\r\npart of the trans-spatial conversation, too. There was enough leakage\r\nfrom Ramos' tightened beam, here at its source, for them to hear what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut when, after a moment, Paul Hendricks answered from the distance,\r\n\"Easy with the talk, fella--overinterested people might be listening,\"\r\nthey suddenly forgot their own enthusiasms. They realized. Their hides\r\ntingled unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nRamos' dark face hardened. Still he spoke depreciatingly. \"Shucks, Paul,\r\nthis is a well-focused beam. Besides it's pointing Earthward and\r\nsunward; not toward the Belt, where most of the real mean folks are...\"\r\nBut he sounded defensive, and very soon he said, \"'Bye for now, Paul.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, Frank Nelsen contacted Art Kuzak, out in the Asteroid\r\nBelt, across a much greater stretch of space. He thought he was cautious\r\nwhen he said, \"We're riding a bit heavy--for you guys...\" But after the\r\ntwenty minute interval it took to get an answer back over ten\r\nlight-minutes of distance traversed twice--186,000 miles for every\r\nsecond, spanned by slender threads of radio energy which were of\r\nlow-power but of low-loss low-dispersal, too, explaining their\r\ntremendous range--Art Kuzak's warning was carefully cryptic, yet plain\r\nto Nelsen and his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for all the favors,\" he growled dryly. \"Now keep still, and be\r\n_real_ thoughtful, Frankie Boy. That also goes for you other two naive\r\nboneheads...\"\r\n\r\nOpen space, like open, scarcely touched country, had produced its\r\noutlaws. But the distances were far greater. The pressures of need were\r\ninfinitely harsher.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, there's a leader named Fessler,\" Gimp rasped, with his phone\r\nturned low so that only his companions could hear him. \"But there are\r\nother names... Art's right. We'd better keep our eyes open and our\r\nmouths shut.\"\r\n\r\nAsteroid miners who had had poor luck, or who had been forced to kill to\r\nwin even the breath of life; colonists who had left Mars after terrible\r\nmisfortunes, there; adventurers soured and maddened by months in a\r\nvacuum armor, smelling the stench of their own unwashed bodies; men\r\nflush with gains, and seeking merely to relieve the tensions of their\r\nrestrained, artificial existences in a wild spree; refugees from rigid\r\nTovie conformism--all these composed the membership of the wandering,\r\nrobbing, hijacking bands, which, though not numerous, were significant.\r\nOnce, most of these men had been reasonably well-balanced individuals,\r\neasily lost in a crowd. But the Big Vacuum could change that.\r\n\r\nRamos, Hines, and Nelsen had heard the stories. Now, their watchfulness\r\nbecame almost exaggerated. They felt their inexperience. They made no\r\nmore radio beam contacts. One of them was always on lookout, clutching a\r\nrifle, peering all around, glancing every few seconds at the\r\nminiaturized radar screen set inside the collar of his helmet. But the\r\nspherical sky remained free of any unexplained blip or luminous speck.\r\nFragments of conversations picked up in their phones--widely separated\r\nasteroid-miners talking to each other, for the most part--obviously came\r\nfrom far away. There was a U.S.S.F. bubb cruising a few million miles\r\noff. Otherwise, the enormous emptiness was safely and perversely empty,\r\nall around.\r\n\r\nThey kept accelerating. For a planned interval, they enjoyed all the\r\ngood things. They found that masculine guardedness and laziness went\r\nwell together. They ate themselves full. Like Mitch Storey had once\r\ndone, they all started hydroponic gardens inside their bubbs. In the\r\npleasant, steamy sun-warmth of those stellene interiors, they bounced\r\nback and forth from elastic wall to elastic wall, with gravity\r\ntemporarily at zero because they had stopped the spin of their bubbs.\r\nThus they loosened their muscles, worked up a sweat. Afterwards they\r\ndozed, slept, listened to beamed radio music or taped recordings of\r\ntheir own. They smiled at pin-up pictures, read microfilmed books\r\nthrough a viewer, looked at the growing plants around them.\r\n\r\nThere was an arrogance in them, because they had succeeded in bringing\r\nso much of home out here. There was even a mood like that of a lost,\r\nlanguid beach in the tropics. And how was that possible, with only a\r\nthin skin of stellene between them and frigid nothing?\r\n\r\nRamos said just about what he had said--long ago, it seemed, now.\r\n\"Nuts--the Big Vacuum ain't so tough.\" But he amended quickly, \"Yeah, I\r\nknow, Frank--don't scowl. When you aren't looking, it can up and kill\r\nyou. Like with my Uncle José, only worse. He was a powder monkey in\r\nMexico. It got so he thought dynamite was his friend. Well, there wasn't\r\neven anything to put in his coffin...\"\r\n\r\nThe luxurious interlude passed, and they reverted mostly to Spartan\r\nmeals of space-gruel, except for some fresh-grown lettuce. Mars became\r\nan agate bead, then a hazy sphere with those swirled, almost fluid\r\nmarkings, where the spores of a perhaps sentient vegetable life followed\r\nthe paths of thin winds, blowing equatorward from the polar caps of\r\nhoarfrost.\r\n\r\nThe three stellene rings bumped lightly on the ten mile chunk of\r\ncaptured asteroidal rock and nickel-iron that was Phobos, Mars' nearer\r\nmoon. Gravitation was almost nil. There was no need, here, for rockets,\r\nto land or take off. The sun-powered ionics were more than enough.\r\n\r\nA small observatory, a U.N.-tended between ground-and-orbit rocket port,\r\nand a few hydroponic garden domes nestled in the jaggedness were about\r\nall that Phobos had--other than the magnificent view of the Red Planet,\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nGimp Hines' freckled face shone in the ruddy light. \"_I'm_ going down,\"\r\nhe declared. \"Just for a few days, to look around near the Survey\r\nStation. You guys?\"\r\n\r\nRamos shrugged, almost disinterested. \"People have been there--some\r\nstill are. And what good is poking around the Station? But who wants to\r\ngoof up, going into the thickets? Others have done that, often enough.\r\nMe for Pallastown, and maybe lots farther, pal.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen wasn't that blasé. On the Moon, he had seen some of the old\r\nMars of advanced native technology, now long extinct. But there was also\r\nthe recent Mars of explorers and then footloose adventurers, wondering\r\nwhat they could find to do with this quiet, pastel-tinted world of\r\ntremendous history. Then had come the colonists, with their tractors and\r\ntheir rolls of stellene to make sealed dwellings and covered fields in\r\nthat thin, almost oxygenless atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut their hopes to find peace and isolation from the crowded and\r\ntroubled Earth by science and hard work even in so harsh a place, had\r\ncome into conflict with a third Mars that must have begun soon after the\r\noriginal inhabitants had been destroyed. Though maybe it had had its\r\nstart, billions of years before, on the planets of another star. The\r\nthickets had seemed harmless. Was this another, _different_\r\ncivilization, that had risen at last in anger, using its own methods of\r\nallergy, terrible repellant nostalgia, and mental distortions?\r\n\r\nFrank felt the call of mystery which was half dread. But then he\r\nshrugged. \"Uh-uh, Gimp. I'd like to go down, too. But the gravity is\r\ntwice that of the Moon--getting up and down isn't so easy. Besides, once\r\nwhen I made a stopover in space, after a nice short hop, I got into\r\ntrouble. I'll pass this one up. I'd like to talk to Mitch Storey,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\nThey all tried to reach him, beaming the Survey Station at the edge of\r\nSyrtis Major, the great equatorial wedge of blue-green growths on the\r\nfloor of a vanished ocean, first.\r\n\r\n\"Mitchell Storey is not around right now,\" a young man's voice informed\r\nthem. \"He wandered off again, three days ago. Does it often... No--we\r\ndon't know where to reach him...\"\r\n\r\nWidening their beams over the short range of considerably less than four\r\nthousand miles, they tried to call Mitch directly. No luck. Contact\r\nshould have been easy. But of course he could be wandering with his\r\nArcher helmet-phone turned off.\r\n\r\nConsidering the reputation of Mars, Nelsen was a bit worried. But he had\r\na perhaps treacherous belief that Mitch was special enough to take care\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\nRamos was impatient. \"We'll hook old Mitch on our party line, sometime,\r\nFrank,\" he said. \"Right now we ought to get started. Space is still nice\r\nand empty ahead, toward the Kuzaks and Pallastown. That condition might\r\nnot last... Gimp, are you honest-to-gosh set on going down to this\r\ndried-up, museum-world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Umhmm. See you soon, though,\" Gimp answered, grinning. \"I'll leave my\r\nbubb and my load of supplies up here on Phobos. Be back for it probably\r\nin a week. And there'll be a freight-bubb cluster, or something, for me\r\nto join up with, and follow you Out...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen and Ramos left Gimp Hines before he boarded the winged skip-glide\r\nrocket that would take him below. Parting words flew back and forth.\r\n\"See you... Take care... Over the Milky Way, suckers...\"\r\n\r\nThen they were standing off from Mars and its two moons. During the next\r\nseveral Earth-days of time, they accelerated with all the power that\r\ntheir bubb ionics could wring out of the sunshine, weakened now, with\r\ndistance. They knew about where to find the Kuzaks. But contact was\r\nweeks off. When they were close enough, they could radio safely,\r\nchecking the exact position of Art's and Joe's supply post. And they\r\nknew enough to steer clear of Ceres, the largest Asteroid, which was\r\nTovie-occupied. All the signs were good. They were well-armed and\r\nwatchful. They should have made the trip without trouble.\r\n\r\nAhead, dim still with distance, but glinting with a pinkish, metallic\r\nshine which made it much brighter than it would otherwise have been, was\r\nPallas, which Ramos watched like a beacon.\r\n\r\n\"Eldorado,\" he said once, cockily, as if he remembered something from\r\nthe Spanish part of his background.\r\n\r\nThey got almost three-quarters across that unimaginable stretch of\r\nemptiness before there was a bad sign. It was a catcall--literally--in\r\ntheir helmet phones. \"Meow!\" It was falsely plaintive and innocuous. It\r\nwas a maliciously childish promise of trouble.\r\n\r\nA little later, there was a chuckle. \"Be cavalier, fellas. Watch\r\nyourselves. I mean it.\" The tone had a strange intensity.\r\n\r\nRamos was on lookout, then, with eyes, radar and rifle. But the spoken\r\nmessage had been too brief to get a fix on the direction of its radio\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nRamos stiffened. With his phone power turned very low, he said,\r\n\"Frank--lots of people say 'Be cavalier', nowadays. But that includes\r\none of the old Bunch. The voice _might_ match, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh--Tiflin, the S.O.B.,\" Nelsen growled softly.\r\n\r\nFor ten hours, nothing else happened. Then there were some tiny\r\nradar-blips, which could have indicated meteors. Nelsen and Ramos\r\nchanged the angle of the ion guides of their ionic motors to move their\r\nbubbs from course, slightly, and dodge. During the first hour, they were\r\nsuccessful. But then there were more blips, in greater numbers.\r\n\r\nFist-sized chunks flicked through their vehicles almost simultaneously.\r\nAir puffed out. Their rings collapsed under them--the sealer was no good\r\nfor holes of such size. At once, the continued spin of the bubbs wound\r\nthem, like limp laundry, into knots.\r\n\r\nWhile Nelsen and Ramos were trying to untangle the mess, visible specks\r\nappeared in the distance. They fired at them. Then something slammed\r\nhard into the fleshy part of Nelsen's hip, penetrating his armor, and\r\npassing on out, again. The sealing gum in the Archer's skin worked\r\neffectively on the needle-like punctures, but the knockout drug had been\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nAs his awareness faded, Nelsen fired rapidly, and saw Ramos doing the\r\nsame--until his hand slapped suddenly at his side...\r\n\r\nAfter that there was nothing, until, for a few seconds, Frank Nelsen\r\nregained a blurred consciousness. He was lying, unarmored, inside a\r\nbubb--perhaps his own, which had been patched and reinflated. All around\r\nhim was loud laughter and talk, the gurgle of liquor, the smells of\r\ncooked meat, a choking concentration of tobacco smoke. Music blared\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n\"Busht out shummore!\" somebody was hollering. \"We got jackpot--the whole\r\nfanshy works! I almost think I'm back in Sputtsberg--wherever hell that\r\nis... But where's the wimmin? Nothing but dumb, prissy pitchers! Not\r\neven _good_ pitchers...!\"\r\n\r\nThere were guys of all sizes, mostly young, some armored, some not. One\r\nwith a pimply face stumbled near. Frank Nelsen choked down his fury at\r\nthe vandalism. He had a blurred urge to find a certain face, and almost\r\nthought he succeeded. But everything, including his head, was a fuzzy\r\njumble.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" the pimply guy gurgled. \"Hey--Boss! Our benefactors--they're half\r\nawake! You should shleep, baby greenhorns...!\"\r\n\r\nA large man with shovel teeth ambled over. Frank managed half to rise.\r\nHe met the blow and gave some of it back. Ramos was doing likewise,\r\ngamely. Then Nelsen's head zeroed out again in a pyrotechnic burst...\r\n\r\nHe awoke to almost absolute silence, and to the turning of the whole\r\nuniverse around him. But of course it was himself that was\r\nrotating--boots over head. There was a bad smell of old sweat, and\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nHis hip felt numb from the needle puncture. In all except the most vital\r\nareas, those slim missiles would not usually cause death, or even\r\nserious injury; but soon the wound would ache naggingly.\r\n\r\nFirst, Frank Nelsen hardly knew where he was. Then he understood that he\r\nwas drifting free in space, in an armor. He thought it was his own until\r\nhe failed to recognize the scuffed, grimy interior. Even the workshirt\r\nhe was wearing wasn't the new blue one he had put on, it seemed only\r\nhours ago. It was a greasy grey.\r\n\r\nEtched into the scratched plastic of the helmet that covered his head,\r\nhe saw \"Archer III--ser. no. 828211.\" And casually stuck into the\r\ngasketted rim of the collar, was a note, pencilled jaggedly on a scrap\r\nof paper:\r\n\r\n\"Honest, Greenie, your a pal. All that nice stuff. Thanks a 1,000,000!\r\nCouple of my boys needed new Archies, bad. Thanks again. You and your\r\nbuddie are not having so bad a brake. These old threes been all over\r\nhell. They will show you all about Asteroid hopping and mining. So will\r\nthe load-hauling net and tools. Thanks for the little dough, too. Find\r\nyour space fitness card in shirt pocket. We don't need it. Have lots of\r\nfun. Just remember me as The Stinker.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen was quivering with anger and scare. He saw that a mended\r\nsteel net, containing a few items, had got wrapped around him with his\r\nturning. He groped for the ion-guide of the ancient shoulder-ionic, and\r\ntouched a control. Slowly his spin was checked. Meanwhile he untangled\r\nhimself, and saw what must be Ramos, adrift like himself in a battered\r\nArcher Three, doing the same.\r\n\r\nGradually they managed to ion glide over to each other. Their eyes met.\r\nThey were the butts of a prank that no doubt had been the source of many\r\nguffaws.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get a letter, too, Frank?\" Ramos asked. For close\r\ncommunication, the old helmet-phones still worked okay.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" Nelsen breathed. \"Why didn't they just knock us off? Alive, we\r\nmight tell on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not slow and funny enough, maybe,\" Ramos answered dolefully. \"In these\r\nbroken-down outfits, we might not live to tell. Besides, even with these\r\nnotes for clues, who'd ever find out who they are, way out here?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen figured that all this was probably the truth. In the Belt, life\r\nwas cheap. Death got to be a joke.\r\n\r\n\"There was an ox of a guy with big teeth!\" he hissed furiously. \"Thought\r\nI saw Tiflin, too--the S.O.B.! Cripes, do I always land in the soup?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bossman with the teeth, I remember,\" Ramos grated. \"Tiflin I don't\r\nknow about. Could be... Hell, though--what now? I suppose we're going in\r\nabout the same direction and at the same speed as before? Have to watch\r\nthe sun and planets to make sure. Did they leave us any instruments?\r\nMeanwhile, we might try to decelerate. I'd like to get out to Pluto\r\nsometime, but not equipped like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll check everything--see how bad off they left us,\" Nelsen said.\r\n\r\nSo that was what they did, after they had set their decrepit\r\nshoulder-ionics to slow them down in the direction of the Belt.\r\n\r\nEach of their hauling nets contained battered chisels, hammers, saws for\r\nmetal, a radiation counter, a beaten-up-looking pistol, some old\r\nposition-finding instruments, including a wristwatch that had seen much\r\nbetter days to be used as a chronometer. There were also two large\r\nflasks of water and two month-supply boxes of dehydrated\r\nspace-gruel--these last items obviously granted them from their own, now\r\nvanished stores. Here was weird generosity--or perhaps just more\r\nghoulish fun to give them the feeble hope of survival.\r\n\r\nNow they checked each other's Archer Threes as well as they could while\r\nthey were being worn. No use even to try to communicate over any\r\ndistance with the worn-out radio transmitters. The nuclear batteries\r\nwere ninety-percent used up, which still left considerable\r\ntime--fortunately, because they had to add battery power to the normally\r\nsun-energized shoulder-ionics, in order to get any reasonable\r\ndecelerating effect out of them. Out here, unlike on the Moon at night,\r\nthe air-restorers could also take direct solar energy through their\r\nwindows. They needed current only for their pumps. But the green\r\nchlorophane, key to the freshening and re-oxygenation of air, was\r\ngetting slightly pale. The moisture-reclaimers were--by luck--not as bad\r\nas some of the other vital parts.\r\n\r\nRamos touched his needled side. His wry grin showed some of his reckless\r\nhumor. \"It's not utterly awful, yet,\" he said. \"How do you feel?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen's hip hurt. And he found that he had an awful hangover from the\r\nknockout drug, and the slapping around he had received. \"Bad enough,\" he\r\nanswered. \"Maybe if we ate something...\"\r\n\r\nThey took small, sealed packets of dehydrated food in through their\r\nchest airlocks, unsleeved their arms, emptied the packets into plastic\r\nsqueeze bottles from the utensil racks before them, injected water from\r\nthe pipettes which led to their shoulder tanks, closed the bottles and\r\nlet the powdered gruel swell as it reabsorbed moisture. The gruel turned\r\nout hot all by itself. For it was a new kind which contained an\r\nexothermic ingredient. They ate, in the absence of gravity, by squeezing\r\nthe bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Guess we'll have to become asteroid-hoppers--miners--like the slob\r\nsaid,\" Nelsen growled. \"Well--I _did_ want to try everything...\"\r\n\r\nThis was to become the pattern of their lives. But not right away. They\r\nstill had an incomplete conception of the vast distances. They hurtled\r\non, certainly decelerating considerably, for days, yet, before they were\r\nin the Belt. Even that looked like enormous emptiness.\r\n\r\nAnd the brightened speck of Pallas was too far to one side. Tovie Ceres\r\nwas too near on the other side--left, it would be, if they considered\r\nthe familiar northern hemisphere stars of Earth as showing \"up\"\r\nposition. The old instruments had put them off-course. Still, they had\r\nto bear even farther left to try to match the direction and the average\r\norbital speed--about twelve miles per second--of the Belt. Otherwise,\r\nsmall pieces of the old planet, hurtling in another direction--and/or at\r\na different velocity--than themselves, could smash them.\r\n\r\nMaybe they thought that they would be located and picked up--the gang\r\nthat had robbed and dumped them had found them easily enough. But there,\r\nagain, was a paradox of enormity. Bands might wait for suckers somewhere\r\nbeyond Mars. Elsewhere, there could be nobody for millions of miles.\r\n\r\nThey saw their first asteroid--a pitted, mesoderm fragment of\r\nnickel-iron from middle-deep in the blasted planet. It was just drifting\r\nslightly before them. So they had achieved the correct orbital speed.\r\nThey ion-glided to the chunk, and began to search clumsily for\r\nworthwhile metal. It was fantastic that somebody had been there before\r\nthem, chiselling and sawing out a greyish material, of which there was a\r\nlittle left that made the needles of their radiation counters swing\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\nThey got a few scraps of the stuff to put into the nets which they were\r\ntowing.\r\n\r\n\"For luck,\" Ramos laughed. \"Without it we'll never pay J. John.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up. Big deal,\" Nelsen snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Okay. Shut up it is!\" Ramos answered him.\r\n\r\nSo they stayed silent until they couldn't stand that, either. Everything\r\nwas getting on their nerves.\r\n\r\nTheir next asteroids were mere chips a foot long--core fragments of the\r\nplanet, heavy metals that had sunk deep. No crust material of any\r\nnormally formed world could ever show such wealth. It gleamed with a\r\npale yellow shine, and made Ramos' sunken eyes light up with an ancient\r\nfever, until he remembered, and until Nelsen said:\r\n\r\n\"Not for the gold, anymore, pal. Common, out here. So it's almost\r\nworthless, everywhere. Not much use as an industrial metal. But the\r\nosmium and uranium alloyed with it are something else. One hunk for each\r\nof our nets. Too bad there isn't more.\"\r\n\r\nThe uranium was driving their radiation-counters wild.\r\n\r\n\"Could we drag it, if there was more?\" Ramos growled. \"With just\r\nsun-power on these lousy shoulder-ionics?\"\r\n\r\nEverything was going sour, even Ramos. After a long deceleration they\r\nwere afraid to draw any more power for propulsion from their weakened\r\nbatteries. They needed the remaining current for the moisture-reclaimers\r\nand the pumps of the air-restorers--a relatively much lighter but vital\r\ndrain. The sunlight was weak way out here. Worse, the solar\r\nthermocouples to power the ionics were almost shot. They tried to fix\r\nthem up, succeeding a little, but using far more time than they had\r\nexpected. Meanwhile, the changed positions of the various large\r\nasteroids, moving in their own individual orbits, lost them any definite\r\nidea of where the Kuzaks' supply post was, and the dizzying distance to\r\nPallas, with only half-functioning ionics to get them there, fuddled\r\nthem in their inexperience.\r\n\r\nSoon their big hope was that some reasonable asteroid-hoppers would come\r\nwithin the few thousand mile range of their weakened transmitters. Then\r\nthey could call, and be picked up.\r\n\r\nMostly to keep themselves occupied, they hunted paymetal, taking only\r\nthe very best that they could find, to keep the towage mass down. Right\r\nfrom the start they cut their food ration--a good thing, because one\r\nmonth went, and then two, as near as they could figure. Cripes, how much\r\nlonger could they last?\r\n\r\nOften they actually encouraged their minds to create illusions. Frank\r\nwould hold his body stiff, and look at the stars. After a while he would\r\nget the soothing impression that he was swimming on his back in a lake,\r\nand was looking up at the night sky.\r\n\r\nMostly, they were out of the regular radio channels. But sometimes,\r\nbecause of the movement of distant bubb clusters that must be kept in\r\ntouch, they heard music and news briefly, again. They heard ominous\r\nreports from the ever more populous Earth. Now it was about areas of\r\nocean to become boundaried and to be \"farmed\" for food. Territorial\r\ndisputes were now extending far beyond the land. Once more, the weapons\r\nwere being uncovered. Of course there were repercussions out here. Ceres\r\nStation was beaming pronouncements, too--rattling the saber.\r\n\r\nNelsen and Ramos listened avidly because it was life, because it was\r\ncontact with lost things, because it was not dead silence.\r\n\r\nTheir own tribulations deepened.\r\n\r\n\"Cripes but my feet stink!\" Ramos once laughed. \"They must be rotten.\r\nThey're sore, and they itch something awful, and I can't scratch them,\r\nor change my socks, even. The fungus, I guess. Just old athlete's foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"The stuff is crawling up my legs,\" Nelsen growled.\r\n\r\nThey knew that the Kuzaks, maybe Two-and-Two, Reynolds, Gimp, Storey,\r\nmust be trying to call them. They kept listening in their helmet-phones.\r\nBut this time Frank Nelsen knew that he'd gotten himself a real haystack\r\nof enormity in which to double for a lost needle. The slender beams\r\ncould comb it futilely and endlessly, in the hope of a fortunate\r\naccident. Only once they heard, \"Nelsen! Ra...\" The beam swept on. It\r\ncould have been Joe Kuzak's voice. But inevitably, somewhere, there had\r\nto be a giving up point for the searchers.\r\n\r\n\"This is where I came in,\" Nelsen said bitterly. \"Damn these beam\r\nsystems that are so delicate and important!\"\r\n\r\nThey did pick up the voices of scattered asteroid-hoppers, talking\r\ncautiously back and forth to each other, far away. \"... Got me\r\npinpointed, Ed? Coming in almost empty, this trip. Not like the last...\r\nStake me to a run into Pallastown...?\" Most of such voices sounded\r\nregular, friendly.\r\n\r\nOnce they heard wild laughter, and what could have been a woman's\r\nscream. But it could have been other things, too.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, they almost believed that they had their rescue\r\nmade. Even their worn-out direction and distance finders could place the\r\nten or so voices as originating not much over a hundred miles away. But\r\nthey checked their trembling enthusiasm just in time. That was sheerest\r\nluck. The curses, and the savage, frightened snarls were all wrong. \"If\r\nwe don't catch us somebody, soon...\"\r\n\r\nOut here, the needs could get truly primitive. Oxygen, water, food,\r\nrepair parts for vital equipment. Cannibalism and blood-drinking could\r\nalso be part of blunt necessity.\r\n\r\nNelsen and Ramos were fortunate. Twenty miles off was a haze against the\r\nstars--a cluster of small mesoderm fragments. Drawing power for their\r\nshoulder-ionics from their almost spent nuclear batteries, they glided\r\ntoward the cluster, and got into its midst, doubling themselves up to\r\nlook as much like the other chunks as possible. They were like hiding\r\nrats for hours, until long after the distant specks moved past.\r\n\r\nWhile he waited, Frank Nelsen's mind fumbled back to the lost phantom of\r\nJarviston, Minnesota, again. To a man named Jig Hollins who had got\r\nmarried, stayed home. Yellow? Hell...! Nelsen imagined the comforts he\r\nmight have had in the Space Force. He coaxed up a dream girl--blonde,\r\ndark, red-headed--with an awful wistfulness. He thought of Nance Codiss,\r\nthe neighbor kid. He fumbled at the edge of a vast, foggy vision, where\r\nthe wanderlust and spacelust of a man, and needs of the expanding race,\r\nseemed to blend with his home-love and love-love, and to become,\r\nimpossibly, a balanced unit...\r\n\r\nLater--much later--he heard young, green asteroid-hoppers yakking\r\nhappily about girls and about how magnificent it was, out here.\r\n\r\n\"Haw-haw,\" he heard Ramos mock.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nelsen said thickly. \"Lucky for them that they aren't near\r\nus--being careless with their beams, that way...\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen sneered, despising these innocent novices, sure that he\r\ncould have beaten and robbed them without compunction. That far he had\r\ncome toward understanding the outlaws, the twisted men of the Belt.\r\n\r\nRamos and he seemed to go on for an indefinite period longer. In a\r\nsense, they toughened. But toward the last they seemed to blunder\r\nslowly in the mind-shadows of their weakening body forces. They had a\r\nlittle food left, and water from the moisture-reclaimers. At\r\nzero-gravity, where physical exertion is slight, men can get along on\r\nsmall quantities of food. The sweetish, starchy liquid that they could\r\nsuck through a tube from the air-restorers--it was a by-product of the\r\nphotosynthetic process--might even have sustained them for a\r\nconsiderable interval.\r\n\r\nBut the steady weakening of their nuclear batteries was another matter.\r\nThe pumps of their air-restorers and moisture-reclaimers were dependent\r\non current. Gradually the atmosphere they breathed was getting worse.\r\nBut from reports they had read and TV programs they had seen long ago,\r\nthey found themselves another faint hope, and worked on it. With only\r\nsolar power--derived through worn-out thermocouple units--to feed their\r\nuncertain ionics, they could change course only very slowly, now.\r\n\r\nYet maybe they had used up their bad luck. At last they came to a\r\nsurface-fragment a couple of hundred yards long. They climbed over its\r\nedge. The thin sunshine hit dried soil, and something like corn-stubble\r\nin rows. Ahead was a solid stone structure, half flattened. Beside it a\r\nfallen trunk showed its roots. Vegetation was charred black by the\r\nabsolute dryness of space. There was a fragment of a road, a wall, a\r\nhillside.\r\n\r\nHere, there must have been blue sky, thin, frosty wind. The small,\r\nMars-sized planet had been far from the sun. Yet perhaps the greenhouse\r\neffect of a high percentage of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere and the\r\nradioactive heat of its interior had helped warm it. At least it had\r\nbeen warm enough to evolve life of the highest order, eons ago.\r\n\r\nPoof had gone the blue sky and this whole world, all in a moment, the\r\nscattered pieces forming the asteroids. Accident? More likely it was a\r\nhuge, interplanetary missile from competing Mars. The Martians had died,\r\ntoo--as surely, though less spectacularly. Radioactive poison,\r\nperhaps... Here, there had been an instant of unimaginable concussion,\r\nand of swift-passing flame. The drying out was soon ended. Then, what\r\nwas left had been preserved in a vacuum through sixty millions of years.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen had glimpsed ancient Mars, preserved on the Moon. Now he\r\nglimpsed its opponent culture, about which more was generally known.\r\n\r\n\"It's real,\" Ramos grunted. \"Hoppers find surface-fragments like this,\r\nquite often.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen hardly cared about the archeological aspects just then.\r\nExcitement and hope that became certainty, enlivened his dulled brain.\r\n\r\n\"An energy source,\" he grated joyfully. \"The Big Answer to Everything,\r\nout here! And it's always self-contained in their buildings...\"\r\n\r\nThey pushed the collapsed and blackened thing with the slender bones,\r\naside. They crept into the flat, horizontal spaces of the dwelling--much\r\nmore like chinks than the rooms that humans would inhabit. They shoved\r\naway soft, multi-colored fabrics spun from glass-wool, a metal case with\r\ngraduated dials and a lens, baubles of gold and glinting mineral.\r\n\r\nIn a recess in the masonry, ribboned with glazed copper strips that led\r\nto clear globes and curious household appliances, they found what they\r\nwanted. Six little oblong boxes bunched together. Their outsides were\r\nblue ceramic.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen and Miguel Ramos began to work gingerly, though the gloves\r\nof their old Archer Threes were insulated. Here, sixty million years of\r\nstopped time had made no difference to these nuclear batteries, that,\r\nbecause of the universal character of physical laws, almost had to be\r\nsimilar in principle to their own. They had almost known that it would\r\nmake no difference. There had been no drain of power through the\r\nautomatic safety switches.\r\n\r\n\"DC current, huh?\" Ramos said, breathing hard of the rotten air in his\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--gotta be,\" Frank answered quickly. \"Same as from a thermocouple.\r\nVoltage about two hundred. Lots of current, though. Hope these old\r\nionics'll take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can tap off lower, if we have to... Here--I'll fix you, first...\r\nGrab this end...\"\r\n\r\nThey had a sweating two hours of rewiring to get done.\r\n\r\nWith power available, they might even have found a way to distill and\r\ncollect the water, usually held in the form of frost, deep-buried in the\r\nsoil of any large surface-fragment. They might have broken down some of\r\nthe water electrolytically, to provide themselves with more oxygen to\r\nbreathe. But perhaps now such efforts were not necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen they switched in the new current, the pumps of their equipment\r\nworked better at once. The internal lights of their air-restorers could\r\nbe used again, augmenting the action of the pale sunshine on the\r\nphotosynthetic processes of the chlorophane. The air they breathed\r\nimproved immediately. They tested the power on the shaky ionics, and got\r\na good thrust reaction.\r\n\r\n\"We can make it--I think,\" Frank Nelsen said, speaking low and quick,\r\nand with the boldness of an enlivened body and brain. \"We'll shoot up,\r\nout of the Belt entirely, then move parallel to it, backwards--contrary\r\nto its orbital flow, that is. But being outside of it, we won't chance\r\ngetting splattered by any fragments. Probably avoid some slobs, too.\r\nWe'll decelerate, and cut back in, near Pallas. There'll be a way to\r\nfind the Kuzak twins.\"\r\n\r\nRamos chuckled recklessly. \"Let's not forget to pack these historical\r\nobjects in our nets. Especially that camera, or whatever it is. Money in\r\nthe bank at last, boy...\"\r\n\r\nBut after they set out, it wasn't long before they knew that two people\r\nwere following them. There was no place to hide. And a mocking voice\r\ncame into their phones.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Nelsen... Oh, Mex... Wait up... I've been looking for you for over\r\nthree months...\"\r\n\r\nThey tried first to ignore the hail. They tried to speed up. But their\r\npursuers still had better propulsion. Nelsen gritted his teeth. He felt\r\nthe certainty of disaster closing in.\r\n\r\n\"There's just two of them--so far,\" Ramos hissed. \"Maybe here's our\r\nchance, Frank, to really smear that rat!\" Ramos' eyes had a battlelight.\r\n\"All right, Tiflin--approach. These guns are lined up and loaded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw--is _that_ friendship, Mex?\" the renegade seemed to wheedle. But\r\ninsolently, he and his larger companion came on.\r\n\r\n\"Toss us your pistols,\" Ramos commanded, as they drifted close, checking\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nTiflin flashed a smirk that showed that his front teeth were missing.\r\n\"Honest, Mex--do you expect us to do that? Be cavalier--I haven't even\r\ngot a pistol, right now. Neither has Igor, here. Come look-see... Hi,\r\nFrankie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just stay there,\" Nelsen gruffed.\r\n\r\nTiflin cocked his head inside the helmet of a brand-new Archer Six, in a\r\nburlesqued pose for inspection. He looked bad. His face had turned hard\r\nand lean. There were scars on it. The nervous, explosive-tempered kid,\r\nwho couldn't have survived out here, had been burned out of him. For a\r\nsecond, Nelsen almost thought that the change could be for the good. But\r\nit was naive to hope that that could happen. Glen Tiflin had become\r\npassive, yielding, mocking, with an air of secret knowledge withheld.\r\nWhat did an attitude like that suggest? Treachery, or, perhaps worse, a\r\nkind of poised--and poisonous--mental judo?\r\n\r\nNelsen looked at the other man, who wore a Tovie armor. Tall,\r\nstarvation-lean. Horse-faced, with a lugubrious, bumpkinish smile that\r\nalmost had a whimsical appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Honest--I just picked up Igor--which ain't his real name--in the course\r\nof my travels,\" Tiflin offered lightly. \"He used to be a comic back in\r\nEurasia. He got bored with life on Ceres, and sort of tumbled away.\"\r\n\r\nWith his body stiff as a stick, Igor toppled forward, his mouth gaping\r\nin dismay. He turned completely over, his great boots kicking awkwardly.\r\nHis angular elbows flapped like crow-wings. He righted himself, looked\r\nastonished, then beatifically self-approving. He burped delicately,\r\npatted his chest plate, then sniffed in sad protest at the leveled\r\npistols.\r\n\r\nNow Nelsen and Ramos cast off the loaded nets they had been towing, and\r\nclosed in on this strange pair. Nelsen did the searching, while Ramos\r\npointed the guns.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't even got my shiv anymore, Frankie,\" Tiflin remarked, casually.\r\n\"Threw it at a guy named Fessler, once. Missed by an inch. Guess it's\r\nstill going--round and round the sun, for millions of years. Longest\r\nknife throw there ever was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fessler!\" Frank snapped. \"Now we're getting places, you S.O.B.! The\r\nfunny character that robbed and dumped Ramos and me, I'll bet. Probably\r\nwith your help! You know him, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Knew_--for a while--past tense,\" Tiflin chuckled wickedly. \"Nope--it\r\nwasn't me that stripped off his armor in space. He wasn't even around,\r\nanymore, when you beauties got caught. They come and they go.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _you_ were around, Tiflin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not. Maybe I was twenty million miles off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like hell!\" Nelsen gritted his teeth, grabbed Tiflin's shoulder, and\r\nswung his gloved fist as hard as he could against the thin layer of\r\nrubber and wire over Tiflin's stomach. He struck three times.\r\n\r\n\"Damn you!\" Nelsen snarled. \"I promised myself I'd get you good, Tiflin!\r\nNow tell us what else you and your friends are cooking for us, or by the\r\nBig Silence, you'll be a drifting, explosively decompressed mummy!\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen didn't know till now, after exerting himself, how weak\r\nprivations had made him. He felt dizzy.\r\n\r\nTiflin's eyes had glazed slightly, as he and Frank did a slow roll,\r\ntogether. He gasped. But that insulting smirk came back.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't had your Wheaties lately, have you, Frank? Go ahead--hit, knock\r\nyourself out. You, too, Mex. I've been slugged before, by big men, in\r\nshape...! Could be I'm not cooking anything. Except I notice that you\r\ntwo have found yourselves some very interesting local objects of ancient\r\nhistory, worth a little money. Also, some good, raw metal... Well, I\r\nsuppose you want to get the load and yourselves to the famous twins, Art\r\nand Joe. That's easy--with luck. Though the region is a trifle\r\ndisturbed, right now. But I can tell you where they are. You won't have\r\nto fiddle around, hunting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, hold these guns, Frank. Lemme have a couple of pokes at the\r\nslob,\" Ramos snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Aw-right, aw-right--who's asking you guys to believe me?\" Tiflin cut\r\nin. \"I'll beam the twins for you--since I'd guess your transmitter won't\r\nreach. You can listen in, and talk back through my set. Okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see what happens--just for kicks,\" Ramos said softly. \"If you're\r\ncalling some friends to come and get us, or anything, Tif--well, you've\r\nhad it!\"\r\n\r\nThey watched Tiflin spin and focus the antenna. \"Kuzak... Kuzak...\r\nKuzak... Kuzak...\" he said into his phone. \"Missing boys alive and\r\ncoming to you. Mex and old Guess Which... Kicking and independent, but\r\nvery hungry, I think... Put on the coffee pot, you storekeepers...\r\nKuzak... Kuzak... Kuzak... Talk up, Frank and Miguel. Your voices will\r\nrelay through my phone...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Art and Joe--it's us,\" Ramos almost apologized.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--we don't quite know yet what Tiflin is pulling. But here we\r\nare--if it's you we're talking to...\"\r\n\r\nThere was the usual long wait as impulses bridged the light-minutes.\r\n\r\nThen Art Kuzak's voice snarled guardedly. \"I hear you, Ram and Nel. Come\r\nin, if you can...! Tif, you garbage! Someday...! This is all. This is\r\nall...\" The message broke off.\r\n\r\nTiflin smirked. \"Third quadrant of the Belt,\" he said, giving a position\r\nin space almost like latitude and longitude on Earth. \"About twenty\r\nminutes of the thirty-first degree. Three degrees above median orbital\r\nplane. Approximately two hundred hours from here. Can Igor and I leave\r\nyou, now, or do you want us to escort you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"_We'll_ escort _you_,\" Ramos said.\r\n\r\nSo it was, until, near the end of a long ride, a cluster of bubbs was in\r\nview in the near distance, and Ramos and Nelsen could contact Art Kuzak\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"We've got Tiflin and his Tovie pal with us, Art,\" Frank Nelsen said.\r\n\"They showed us the way, more or less because we made them. But Tif did\r\ngive us the right position at the start. A favor, maybe. I don't know.\r\nAnd now he's saying, 'Be cavalier--it might be awkward for me to meet\r\nArt and Joe just at present.' Do you want to fix this character's wagon\r\nbad enough? Your customers could get mean--if he ever did them dirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one thing I've got against Tiflin!\" Art snarled back. \"Every time\r\nI hear his voice, it means trouble. But I've never seen the crumb\r\nface-to-face since that Moonhop. Okay, let's not spoil my stomach. Turn\r\nhim loose. It can't make much difference. Or maybe I'm sentimental about\r\nthe old Bunch. He was our cracked, space-wild punk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Art,\" Tiflin laughed.\r\n\r\nIn a minute he, and his comic, scarecrow pal who originated from the\r\ndark side of trouble, on Earth and out here, too, were fading against\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\nNelsen and Ramos, the long-lost, glided in, past some grim hoppers. A\r\nbubb and sweet air were around them once more. They shed their stinking\r\nArcher Threes. Hot showers--miraculous luxury--played over them. They\r\nrubbed disinfectant salves into their fungus-ridden hides.\r\n\r\nThen there was a clean, white table, with plates, knives, forks. They\r\nhad to treat their shrunken stomachs gently--just a little of\r\neverything--beer, steak, vegetables, fruit... Somewhere during the past,\r\nunmarked days Frank Nelsen had gotten to be twenty years old. Only\r\ntwenty? Well--maybe this was his celebration.\r\n\r\nRamos and he told their story very briefly. Little time was wasted on\r\ncongratulations for survival or talk of losses long past. The Kuzaks\r\nlooked leaner and tougher, now, and there were plenty of present\r\ndifficulties to worry them. Joe Kuzak hurried out to argue with the\r\nminers at the raw metal receiving bins and at the store bubbs. Art\r\nstayed to explain the present situation.\r\n\r\n\"Three big loads of supplies were shipped through to us from the Moon,\"\r\nhe growled. \"We did fine, trading for metal. We sent J. John Reynolds\r\nhis percentage--a fair fraction of his entire loan. We sent old Paul\r\nfive thousand dollars. But the fourth and fifth loads of trade stuff got\r\npirated en route. When there's trouble on Earth, it comes out here, too.\r\nCeres, colonized by our socialist Tovie friends of northern Eurasia,\r\nhelps stir up the bums, who think up plenty of hell on their own. It's a\r\nforce-out attempt aimed at us or at anybody who thinks our way. After\r\ntwo lost shipments, and a lot of new installations here at the Post,\r\nwe're about broke, again. Worse, we've got the asteroid-hoppers\r\nexpecting us to come through with pay for the new metal in their nets,\r\nand with stuff they need. Back home, some people used to raise hell\r\nabout a trifle like a delayed letter. How about a spaceman's reaction,\r\nwhen what is delayed may be something to keep him alive? They could get\r\nreally annoyed, and kick this place apart.\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak blew air up past his pug nose, and continued. \"Finance--here\r\nwe go again, Frank!\" he chuckled. \"Gimp Hines is helping us. After Mars,\r\nhe came here without trouble. He's in Pallastown, now, trying to raise\r\nsome fast cash, and to rush supplies through from there, under Space\r\nForce guard. You know he's got a head for commerce as well as science.\r\nBut our post, here, perhaps isn't considered secure enough to back a\r\nloan, anymore.\"\r\n\r\nArt grinned wryly at Nelsen and Ramos. His hint was plain. He had seen\r\nthe museum pieces that they had brought in.\r\n\r\n\"Should we, Frank?\" Ramos chuckled after a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly... We've got some collateral, Art. Lots more valuable per unit\r\nmass than any raw metal, I should think.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you might want to work for us?\" Art inquired blandly.\r\n\r\n\"Not 'for',\" Nelsen chuckled. \"We might say 'with'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Cuties,\" Art laughed.\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak had just come back into the dwelling and office bubb.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let my twin sell you any rotten apples, fellas,\" he warned\r\nlightly. \"He might be expecting you to transport your collateral to\r\nPallastown. Naturally anybody trying to strangle this Post will be\r\nblocking the route. You might get robbed again. Also murdered.\"\r\n\r\nRamos' gaunt face still had its daring grin. \"Frank and I know that,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I'm past bragging. But we've had experience. Now, we might be\r\nsmart enough to get through. A few more days out there won't hurt. How\r\nabout it, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten hours sleep and breakfast,\" Frank said. \"Then a little camouflage\r\nmaterial, new weapons, a pair of Archers in condition--got any left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five in stock,\" Joe answered.\r\n\r\n\"Settled, then?\" Art asked.\r\n\r\n\"Here, it is,\" Ramos answered, and Nelsen nodded.\r\n\r\nIt would have been rough going for them to try to sleep in beds. They\r\nhad lost the habit. They slept inside their new Archer Fives.\r\n\r\nAfterwards they painted their armor a dark grey, like chunks of mesoderm\r\nstone. They did likewise to the two bundles in which they wrapped their\r\nrelics.\r\n\r\nThey were as careful as possible to get away from the post without being\r\nobserved, visually or by radar. But of course you could never be sure.\r\n\r\nHuddled up to resemble stray fragments, they curved out of the\r\nBelt--toward the Pole Star, north of its orbital plane. Moving in a\r\nparallel course, they proceeded toward Pallastown. The only thing that\r\nwould seem odd was that they were moving contrary to the general orbital\r\nrotation of most of the permanent bodies of the solar system. Of course\r\nthey and their bundles _might_ have been stray meteors from deep in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nFour watchful, armored figures seemed to notice the peculiarity of their\r\ndirection, and to become suspicious. These figures seemed too wary for\r\nhonesty as they approached. They got within twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\nEven without the memory that Tiflin might make guesses about what they\r\nmeant to do, Nelsen and Ramos would have taken no chances. They had to\r\nbe brutal. Homing darts pierced armor. The four went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe asteroid, Pallas, was a chunk of rich core material, two\r\nhundred-some miles in its greatest dimension. It had a mottled, pinkish\r\nshine, partly from untarnished lead, osmium, considerable uranium, some\r\niron, nickel, silver, copper. The metals were alloyed, here; almost\r\npure, there. There was even a little rock. But thirty-five percent of\r\nPallas' roughly spherical mass was said to be gold.\r\n\r\nGold is not rare at the cores of the worlds, to which most of the heavy\r\nelements must inevitably sink, during the molten stage of planetary\r\ndevelopments. On Earth it must be the same, though who could dig three\r\nthousand miles into a zone of such heat and pressure? But the asteroid\r\nworld had exploded. Pallas was an exposed and cooled piece of its heart.\r\n\r\nPallas had a day of twenty-four hours because men, working with great\r\nion jets angling toward the stars, had adjusted its natural rate of\r\nrotation for their own convenience to match the terrestrial. A greater\r\nchange was Pallastown.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen and Miguel Ramos made the considerable journey to it\r\nwithout further incident. Because he was tense with hurry, Nelsen's\r\nimpressions were superficial: Something like Serene, but bigger and more\r\nfantastic. A man weighed only a few ounces, here. Spidery guidance\r\ntowers could loom impossibly high. There were great storage bins for raw\r\nmetal brought in from all over the Belt. There were rows of water tanks.\r\nAs on the Moon, the water came mostly from gypsum rock or occasionally\r\nfrom soil frost, both found on nearby crustal asteroids. Beyond the\r\nrefineries bulged the domes of the city itself, housing factories,\r\ngardens, recreation centers, and sections that got considerably lost and\r\ndivergent trying to imitate the apartment house areas of Earth.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's wonder was hurried and dulled.\r\n\r\nGimp Hines and David Lester were waiting inside the stellene reception\r\ndome when Nelsen and Ramos landed lightly at the port on their own feet,\r\nwith no more braking assistance than their own shoulder-ionics.\r\n\r\nGreetings were curiously breathless yet casual, but without any\r\nbackslapping.\r\n\r\n\"We'd about given you two up,\" Gimp said. \"But an hour ago Joe Kuzak\r\nbeamed me, and said you'd be along with some museum stuff... Les lives\r\nhere, now, working with the new Archeological Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi-hi--good to see you guys,\" Ramos said.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise. Hello, Les,\" Frank put in.\r\n\r\nWhile Frank was gripping David Lester's limp, diffident hand, which\r\nseemed almost to apologize for his having come so far from home, Gimp\r\nteased a little. \"So you latched onto Art Kuzak, too. Or was it the\r\nother way around?\"\r\n\r\nFrank's smile was lopsided. \"I didn't analyze motives. Art's a pretty\r\ngood guy. I suppose we just wanted to help Joe and him out. Or maybe it\r\nwas instinct. Anyhow, what's wrong with latching onto--or being latched\r\nonto by--somebody whom you feel will get himself and you ahead, and make\r\nyou both a buck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Check. Not a darn thing,\" Gimp laughed. \"Now let's go to my hotel and\r\nhave a look at what you brought in. Did you really examine it, yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some--on the way. Not very much,\" Ramos said. \"There's a camera.\"\r\n\r\nIn the privacy of Gimp's quarters, the bundles were opened; the\r\ncontents, some of them dried and gruesome, all of them rather wonderful,\r\nwere exposed.\r\n\r\nDavid Lester and Gimp Hines were both quietly avid. Lester knew the most\r\nabout these things, but Gimp's hands, on the strange camera, were more\r\nskillful. The cautious scrutiny of dials and controls marked with\r\ncryptic numerals and symbols, and the probing of detail parts and their\r\nfunctions, took about an hour.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Les?\" Gimp asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not an expert, yet,\" Lester answered. \"But as far as I know, this\r\nis the first undamaged camera that has yet been found. That makes it\r\nunique. Of course by now, hoppers are bringing in quite a lot of\r\nartifacts from surface-asteroids. But there's not much in the way of new\r\nprinciple for our camera manufacturers to buy. Lens systems, shutters,\r\nshock mountings, self-developing, integral viewing, projecting and sonic\r\nfeatures, all turn out to be similar to ours. It's usually that way with\r\nother devices, too. It's as if all their history, and ours, were\r\nparallel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dammit--let's see what the thing can show!\" Ramos gruffed.\r\n\r\nIn the darkened room, the device threw a rectangle of light on the wall.\r\nThen there was shape, motion, and color, kept crystallized from sixty\r\nmillion years before. A cloud, pinked by sunrise, floating high in a\r\nthin, expanded atmosphere. Did clouds everywhere in the universe always\r\nlook much the same? Wolfish, glinting darts, vanishing away. Then a\r\nmountainside covered with spiny growths that, from a distance, seemed\r\nhalf cactus and half pine. A road, a field, a dull-hued cylinder\r\npointing upward. Shapes of soft, bluish grey, topped like rounded roofs,\r\nunfolding out of a chink, and swaying off in a kind of run--with little\r\nclinkings of equipment, for there were sounds, too. Two eyelike organs\r\nprojecting upward, the pupils clear and watchful. A tendril with a\r\nridged, dark hide, waving what might have been a large, blue flower,\r\nwhich was attached to the end of a metal tube by means of a bit of fibre\r\ntied in a granny knot. A sunburst of white fire in the distance...\r\n\r\nIt could have gone on, perhaps for many hours. Reality, with every\r\ndetail sharp. Parallels with Earthly life. Maybe even sentiment was\r\nthere, if you only knew how it was shown. But in the differences you got\r\nlost, as if in a vivid dream that you couldn't fully understand. Though\r\nwhat was pictured here was certainly from the last beautiful days of a\r\ncompeting planet.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's mouth often hung open with fascination. But his own\r\nrealities kept intruding. They prodded him.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to break this off,\" he said. \"But a lot of asteroid-hoppers are\r\nout at the post, waiting for Ramos and me to bring stuff back. It's a\r\nlong ride through a troubled region. There's plenty to get arranged\r\nbeforehand... So first, what do we do to realize some quick funds out of\r\nthese relics?\"\r\n\r\nHines terminated the pictured sequence. \"Frank--Ramos--I'd keep this\r\ncamera,\" he said urgently. \"It's a little bit special, at least. History\r\nis here, to be investigated. Offers--bids--could come up. Okay--I'm\r\ntalking about dough, again. Still, who wants to detach himself, right\r\naway, from something pretty marvelous, by selling it? I'd dump most of\r\nthe other things. Getting a loan--the hock-shop approach--is no good...\r\nAm I telling it right, Les?\"\r\n\r\nLester nodded. \"More of the same will be brought in. Prices will drop.\r\nArcheological Survey has a buying service for museums back home. I've\r\nbeen working for them for a month. I don't claim to love them entirely,\r\nbut they'll give you the safest break. You should get enough, for your\r\npurposes, without the camera. With a load like this, you can see Doc\r\nLinford, the boss, any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now, then,\" Frank said.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you impolite slobs!\" Ramos laughed. \"When do you consult me,\r\nco-discoverer and -owner? Awright, skip it--you're the Wizards of Oz.\r\nI'll just grab out a few items for my Ma and the kids, and maybe a girl\r\nor two I'll meet someplace. You guys might as well do the same.\"\r\n\r\nHe took some squares of fabric, silken-soft, though spun from fibre of\r\ncolored glass. And some wheeled devices, which might have been toys.\r\nLester and Hines picked up only token pieces of the fabric. Frank took a\r\nthree inch golden ring that glinted with mineral. Except that it looked\r\ndecorative, he had no idea of its original purpose.\r\n\r\nThe broken, fine-boned mummy and the other items were appraised and\r\nbought in a large room across the city. It was already cluttered with\r\nqueer fossils and objects. The numbers printed on the two equal checks,\r\nand on the cash in their hands, still looked slightly mythical to Nelsen\r\nand Ramos, to whom a thousand dollars had seemed a fortune.\r\n\r\nLater, at the U.S.S.F. headquarters, he was prepared to argue grimly.\r\nWords were in his mind: A vital matter of supply... Without an escort,\r\nwe'll still have to try to get through, alone. You have been informed,\r\ntherefore, if anything happens, you will be responsible...\r\n\r\nHe didn't have to say anything like this. They knew. Maybe an old\r\nbitterness had made him misjudge the U.S.S.F. A young colonel smiled\r\ntiredly.\r\n\r\n\"This has been happening,\" he said. \"We have limited facilities for this\r\npurpose. The U.N.S.F. even less. However, an escort is due in, now. We\r\ncan move out again, with you, in seven hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Nelsen responded.\r\n\r\nGimp Hines had the better part of the supplies to be purchased already\r\nlined up at the warehouses.\r\n\r\nNelsen counted the money he had left. \"Figuring losses and gains, I have\r\nno idea how much I owe J. John--if anything,\" he laughed. \"So I'll make\r\nit a grand--build up my ego... But we owe old Paul more than dough.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'm another idiot--I'll mail J. John a similar draft,\" Ramos\r\ngruffed. \"Paul's a problem. He can use money, but he never lived for it.\r\nAnd you can't buy a friend. We'll have to rig something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--we will,\" Gimp said. \"Couple of times I forgot J. John. But I\r\nlost my shirt on those loads that were lifted off you boneheads. The\r\nKuzaks reimbursed me for half. Do you two want to cover the other half?\r\nAw--forget it! Who's got time to figure all this? That old coot doped\r\nhimself out a nice catch-dollar scheme, making us promise. Or was it a\r\nleg pull on a highly elusive proposition, where big sums and the\r\nvastness of space seem to match? Hell--I'm getting mixed up again...\"\r\n\r\nDave Lester had wandered off embarrassedly, there in the warehouse. But\r\nnow he returned, clearing his throat for attention.\r\n\r\n\"Fellas,\" he said. \"Helen and I want you to come out to our apartment,\r\nnow, for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks, that's swell, Les,\" Ramos responded, suddenly curious.\r\n\r\n\"Here, also,\" Nelsen enthused.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Gimp said. But his smile thinned.\r\n\r\nIn this gravity, going to Lester's place was a floating glide rather\r\nthan a walk. Along a covered causeway, into a huge dome, up a wall with\r\nhandholds, onto a wispy balcony. Nelsen and Ramos brought liquor and\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nMuch of what followed was painful and familiar--in a fantastic setting.\r\nTwo young people, recently married, struggling with problems that they\r\nhadn't been able to plan for very well.\r\n\r\nWhile his wife was out of earshot, Lester put his hand on the back of a\r\nchair constructed entirely of fine golden wire--later it developed that\r\nhe had made it, do-it-yourself fashion, to be economical--and seemed\r\nmore intent on holding it down than to rest his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Gimp... Frank...\" he began nervously. \"You helped Helen and me to get\r\nmarried and get set up out here. The Archeological Institute paid our\r\nway to Pallastown. But there were other expenses... Her--my\r\nfather-in-law, died by his own hand while still awaiting trial...\r\nEverything he owned is still tied up... Now, well--you know human\r\nbiology... I hope you can wait a little longer for us to begin paying\r\nback your loan...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen had a vagrant thought about how money now had to stand on its own\r\ncommercial value, rather than rely on the ancient witchcraft of a gold\r\nstandard. Then he almost suspected that Lester was being devious and\r\nclever. But he knew the guy too well.\r\n\r\n\"Cripes, Les!\" he burst out almost angrily. \"How about your services,\r\njust now, as an archeological consultant? If you won't consider that we\r\nmight have meant to make you a gift. Pretty soon you'll have us\r\ncompletely confused!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a topic for an evening of fun,\" Gimp complained. \"Hey, Helen--can\r\nI mix the drinks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--of course, Mr. Hines. I'll get you the things,\" she said with\r\napology in her eyes and voice, as if fussy celebrities had descended on\r\nher small, unsettled, and poor household.\r\n\r\n\"On the Moon you were a swell cook, Helen,\" Frank reminded her.\r\n\r\nShe flashed a small smile. \"It was different, there. Things weighed\r\nsomething, and stayed in place. Here--just breathe hard and you have a\r\nkitchen accident. Besides, I had a garden. We'd like one here, but\r\nthere's no room... And in the market...\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks--it's new here to us, too,\" Ramos soothed. \"Riding an Archer in\r\nspace, at zero-G, is different from this...\"\r\n\r\nThings were a bit less strained, after that, through the skimpy meal,\r\nwith its special devices, unique to the asteroids and their tiny\r\ngravity. Clamps to fasten plates to tables and victuals to plates.\r\nDrinking vessels that were half-squeeze bottles. Such equipment was now\r\navailable in what might once have been called a dime store--but with\r\nanother price-level.\r\n\r\nThe visitors made a game of being awkward and inept, together. It was\r\nbalm for Helen's sensitivity.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's got to keep the camera for us, Mex,\" Frank Nelsen said\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--I know. Les'll do it for us,\" Ramos answered. \"He's the best,\r\nthere. He can run through all the pictures--make copies with an ordinary\r\ncamera... See if he can market them. Twenty percent ought to be about\r\nright for his cut.\"\r\n\r\nLester tried to interrupt, but Frank got ahead of him. \"We owe Gimp for\r\nthose loads we lost. Got to cut him into this, as a consultant. You'll\r\nbe around Pallastown for a while, helping out with this end of the\r\nTwin's enterprises, won't you, Gimp?\"\r\n\r\nHines grinned. \"Probably. Glad you slobs got memories. Glad to be of\r\nassistance, anytime. Les is no louse--he'll help old friends. I'll bring\r\nhim the camera, out of the safe at my hotel, as soon as we leave\r\nhere...\"\r\n\r\nLester smiled doubtfully, and then happily. That was how they worked the\r\nfabulous generosity of spacemen in the chips on him.\r\n\r\nNelsen, Ramos and Hines escaped soon after that.\r\n\r\n\"Three hours left. I guess you guys want to get lost--separately,\" Gimp\r\nchuckled. \"I'll say so long at the launching catapults, later. I've got\r\nsome tough guards, fresh from the Moon, who will go along with you. Art\r\nand Joe need them...\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen wandered alone in the recreation area. He heard\r\nmusic--_Fire Streak_, _Queen of Serene_... He searched faces, looking\r\nfor an ugly one with shovel teeth. He thought, with an achy wistfulness,\r\nof a small hero-worshipping girl named Jennie Harper, at Serene.\r\n\r\nHe found no one he had ever seen before. In a joint he watched a girl\r\nwith almost no clothes, do an incredible number of spinning somersaults\r\nin mid-air. He thought he ought to find himself a friend--then decided\r\nperversely, to hell with it.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the trouble on Earth, of Ceres, of Tiflin and Igor, of\r\nFanshaw, the latest leader of the Asteroid Belt toughs--the Jolly\r\nLads--that you heard about. He thought about how terribly vulnerable to\r\nattack Pallastown seemed, even with its encirclement of outriding guard\r\nstations. He thought of Paul Hendricks, Two-and-Two Baines, Charlie\r\nReynolds, Otto Kramer, Mitch Storey, and Miss Rosalie Parks who was his\r\nold Latin teacher.\r\n\r\nHe thought of trying to beam some of them. But hell, they all seemed so\r\nlong-lost, and he wasn't in the mood, now. He even thought about how it\r\nwas, trying to give yourself a dry shave with a worn-out razor, inside\r\nan Archer. He thought that sometime, surely, perhaps soon, the Big\r\nVacuum would finish him.\r\n\r\nHe wound up with a simple sentimental impulse, full of nostalgia and\r\ntenderness for things that seemed to stay steady and put. The way he\r\nfelt was half-hearted apology for human moods in which murder would have\r\nbeen easy. He even had a strange envy for David Lester.\r\n\r\nInto the synthetic cellulose lining of a small carton bought at a\r\nsouvenir shop, he placed the sixty million-year old golden band with its\r\nodd arabesques and its glinting chips of mineral. Regardless of its\r\nmysterious intentional function, it could be a bracelet. To him, just\r\nthen, it was only a trinket that he had picked up.\r\n\r\nBefore he wrapped and addressed the package, he put a note inside:\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Nance Codiss! Thinking about you and all the neighbors. This might\r\nreach you by Christmas. Remember me? Frank Nelsen.\"\r\n\r\nPostage was two hundred dollars, which seemed a trifle. And he didn't\r\nquite realize how like a king's ransom a gift like this would seem in\r\nJarviston, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the post office, he promptly forgot the whole matter, as\r\nhard, practical concerns took hold of him, again.\r\n\r\nAt the loading quays, special catapults hurled the gigantic bales of\r\nsupplies clear of Pallas. To the Kuzaks, this shipment would now have\r\nseemed small, but it was much larger than the loads Ramos and Nelsen had\r\nhandled before. Gimp and Lester saw them off. Then they were in space,\r\nwith extra ionics pushing the bales. The guard of six new men was\r\nposted. Nelsen wasn't sure that they'd be any good, or whether he could\r\ntrust them all, but they looked eagerly alert. Riding a mile off was the\r\nSpace Force patrol bubb.\r\n\r\nAll through the long journey--beam calls ahead were avoided for added\r\nsafety--Nelsen kept wondering if he'd find the post in ruins, with what\r\nwas left of Art and Joe drifting and drying. But nothing like that\r\nhappened yet, and the shipment was brought through. Business with the\r\nasteroid-hoppers was started at once.\r\n\r\nWhen there was a lull, Art Kuzak talked expansively in his office bubb:\r\n\r\n\"Good work, Frank. Same to you, Ramos--except that I know you're itching\r\nwith your own ideas, and probably won't be around long. Which is your\r\naffair... Never mind what anybody says about Venus, or any other place.\r\nThe Belt, with its history, its metals, and its possibilities, is the\r\nbest part of the solar system. Keep your defenses up, your line of\r\ncommunication covered, and you can't help but make money. There are new\r\nposts to set up, help to recruit and bring out, stellene plants and\r\nother factories to construct. There'll be garden bubbs, repair\r\nshops--everything. Time, work, and a little luck will do it. You\r\nlistening, Frank?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen got a bit cagy with Art, again. \"Okay, Art--you seem like a\r\nformal fella. Mex and I joined up and helped out pretty much as informal\r\ncompany members. But as long as we've put in our dough, let's make it\r\nofficial, in writing and signed. The KRNH Enterprises--_K_uzak, _R_amos,\r\n_N_elsen and _H_ines. The 'H' could also stand for Hendricks--Paul\r\nHendricks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _like_ it that way, you suspicious slob,\" Art Kuzak chuckled.\r\n\r\nSo another phase began for Nelsen. Offices bored him. Amassing money,\r\nper se, meant little to him, except as a success symbol that came out of\r\nthe life he had known. He figured that a man ought to be a success, even\r\na rough-and-tumble romantic like Ramos, or Joe Kuzak. Or himself, with\r\nboth distance and home engrained confusingly into his nature.\r\n\r\nOne thing that Nelsen was, was conscientious. He could choose and stick\r\nto a purpose for even longer than it seemed right for him.\r\n\r\nMostly, now, during the long grind of expansion, he was afield.\r\nDisturbances on Earth quieted for a while, as had always happened, so\r\nfar. The Belt responded with relative peace. Tovie Ceres, the Big\r\nAsteroid, which, like the others, should have been open to all nations,\r\nbut wasn't, kept mostly to its own affairs. There were only the constant\r\ndangers, natural, human, and a combination. There was always a job--a\r\nconvoy to meet, a load of supplies to rush to a distant point, Jolly\r\nLads to scare off. Reckless Ramos might be with Nelsen, or Joe Kuzak who\r\nusually operated separately, or a few guards, or several\r\nasteroid-hoppers, most of whom were tough and steady and good friends to\r\nknow. Often enough, Nelsen was alone.\r\n\r\nAt first, KRNH just handled the usual supplies. But when factory and\r\nhydroponic equipment began to arrive, Joe Kuzak and Frank Nelsen might\r\nbe out establishing a new post. There'd be green help, bubbing out from\r\nthe Moon, to break in. Nelsen would see new faces that still seemed\r\nfamiliar, because they were like those of the old Bunch, as it had been.\r\nGrim, scared young men, full of wonder. But the thin stream of the\r\nadventurous was thickening, as more opportunities opened. Occasionally\r\nthere was a young couple. _Oh, no_, you thought. Then--_well, maybe_.\r\nThat is, if somebody didn't crack up, or get lymph node swellings that\r\nwouldn't reduce, and if you didn't have to try to play nursemaid.\r\n\r\nNow and then Nelsen was in Pallastown--for business, for relief, for a\r\nbit of hell-raising; to see Gimp and the David Lesters. Pretty soon\r\nthere was an heir in the Lester household. Red, healthy, and male.\r\nCripes--Out Here, too? Okay--josh the parents along. The most wonderful\r\nboy in the solar system! Otherwise, matters, there, were much better\r\nthan before. The camera was in a museum in Washington. The pictures it\r\nhad contained were on TV, back home. Just another anti-war film, maybe.\r\nBut impressive, and _different_. The earnings didn't change Nelsen's\r\nlife much, nor Gimp's, nor Ramos'. But it sure helped the Lesters.\r\n\r\nDavid Lester had resigned from Archeological Survey. He was getting\r\nactually sharp. He was doing independent research, and was setting up\r\nhis own business in Belt antiques.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen had another reason for coming to Pallastown. Afield, you\r\navoided beam communication, nowadays, whenever you could. Someone might\r\ntrace your beam to its source, and jump you for whatever you had. But\r\nGimp Hines could tell Nelsen about the absent Bunch members and the old\r\nfriends, while they both sat in the little KRNH office in Town.\r\n\r\n\"... Paul Hendricks is still the same, Frank. New bunch around him...\r\nToo bad we can't call him, now--because the Earth is on the far side of\r\nthe sun. Mitch Storey just vanished into the Martian thickets, during\r\none of his jaunts. Almost a year ago, now... I didn't see him when I\r\nstopped over on Mars, but he was back at the Station once, after that.\r\nTake it easy, Frank. They've looked with helicopters, and even on the\r\nground; you couldn't do any more. I'll keep in touch, to see if anything\r\nturns up...\"\r\n\r\nAfter a minute, Nelsen relaxed, slightly. \"Two-and-Two? I guess he's\r\nokay--with Charlie Reynolds looking after him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar about Charlie,\" Gimp answered, looking awed and puzzled. \"Got\r\nthe news from old J. John, his granddad, when he acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of our latest draft, by letter. Hold your hat. Charlie got\r\nhimself killed... I'll dig the letter out of the file.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen sat up very straight. \"Never mind,\" he said. \"Just tell me more.\r\nAnything can happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our most promising member,\" Gimp mused. \"He didn't get much. The Venus\r\nExpedition had to move some heavy equipment to the top of a mountain, to\r\nmake some electrostatic tests before a storm. Charlie had just climbed\r\ndown from the helicopter. A common old lightning bolt hit him. Somebody\r\nplayed _Fire Streak_ on the bagpipes--inside a sealed tent--while they\r\nburied him. Otherwise, he didn't even get a proper spaceman's funeral.\r\nVenus' escape velocity is almost as high as Earth's. Boosting a corpse\r\nup into orbit, just for atmospheric cremation, would have been too much\r\nof a waste for the Expedition's rigid economy.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen had never really been very close to Charlie Reynolds, though he\r\nhad liked the flamboyant Good Guy. Now, it was all a long ways back,\r\nbesides. Nelsen didn't feel exactly grief. Just an almost mystical\r\nbitterness, a shock and an uncertainty, as if he could depend on\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"So what about Two-and-Two?\" he growled, remembering how he used to\r\navoid any responsibility for the big, good-hearted lug; but now he felt\r\nsurer about himself, and things seemed different.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the Expedition medic had to straighten him out with\r\ndevil-killers,\" Hines answered. \"He bubbed all the way back to Earth,\r\nalone, to see J. John about Charlie. I beamed him, there, before the\r\nEarth hid behind the sun. He was still pretty shaken up. Funny,\r\ntoo--Charlie's opportunity-laden Venus has turned out to be a bust, for\r\ntwo centuries, at least, unless new methods, which aren't in sight, yet,\r\nturn up. Sure--at staggering expense, and with efforts on the order of\r\nfantasy, reaction motors could be set up around its equator, to make it\r\nspin as fast as the Earth. Specially developed green algae have already\r\nbeen seeded all over the planet. They're rugged, they spread fast. But\r\nit will take the algae about two hundred years to split the carbon\r\ndioxide and give the atmosphere a breathable amount of free oxygen, to\r\nsay nothing of cracking the poisonous formaldehyde.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two-and-Two's back in Jarviston, then?\" Nelsen demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No--not anymore--just gimme breath,\" Hines went on. \"He and Charlie had\r\nfigured another destination of opportunity--Mercury, the planet nearest\r\nthe sun, everlasting frozen night on one side, eternal, zinc-melting\r\nsunshine on the other. But there's the fringe zone between the two--the\r\nTwilight Zone. If you can live under stellene, you've got a better place\r\nthere than Mars might have been. Colonists are going there, to quit the\r\nEarth, to get away from it all. Two-and-Two was about to leave for\r\nMercury, when I last spoke to him. By now he's probably almost there.\r\nAnd even under the most favorable conditions, Mercury is hard to\r\nbeam--too much solar magnetic interference.\"\r\n\r\n\"That poor sap,\" Nelsen gruffed.\r\n\r\n\"It probably isn't that bad, anymore,\" Hines commented. \"Sometime I\r\nmight go to Mercury, myself--when I get good and sick of sitting on my\r\ntail, here--when I always was a man of action! Mercury does have\r\npossibilities--plenty of solar power, certainly; plenty of frozen\r\natmosphere on the dark face. Interesting, Frank... Oh, hell, I\r\nforgot--there's a letter here for you. And a package. Just arrived...\r\nI'll scram, now. Got to go down to the quays. Hold the fort, here, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nGimp Hines grinned as he left.\r\n\r\nNelsen was glad to be alone. The lonesomeness of the Big Vacuum was\r\ngetting grimed into him. When he saw the return name and address on the\r\npackage, and the two hundred-ten dollar postage sticker, he thought,\r\n_Cripes--that poor kid--what did I start?_ Then the awful wave of\r\nnostalgia for Jarviston, Minnesota, hit him, as he fumbled to open the\r\nmicrofilmed letter capsule, and put it in the viewer.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Frank--it has to be that, doesn't it, and not Mr. Nelsen, since\r\nyou've sent me this miraculous bracelet--which I don't dare wear very\r\nmuch, since I don't want to lose an arm to some international--or even\r\ninterstellar--jewel thief! It makes me feel like the Queen of\r\nSomething--certainly not Serene, since it implies calmness and repose,\r\nwhich I certainly don't feel--no offense to our Miss Sands, whom I\r\nadmire enormously. In a very small way I am repaying to you in kind--an\r\nitem which I made, myself, and which I know that some spacemen use\r\ninside their Archers. You see, we are all informed in details. Paul,\r\nOtto, Chippie Potter and his dog, and other characters whom you won't\r\nremember, send their best greetings. Oh, I've got Stardust fever, too,\r\nbut I'll yield to my folks' wishes and wait, and learn a profession that\r\nwill be of some use Out There. May you wear what I'm sending in good\r\nhealth, safety and fortune. Send no more staggering gifts, please--I\r\ncouldn't stand it--but please do write. Tell me how it really is in the\r\nBelt. You simply don't realize how much--\"\r\n\r\nNance Codiss' missive rattled along, and the scrawled words got to be\r\nlike small, happy bells inside Nelsen's skull. His crooked grin came\r\nout; he unpacked the sweater--creylon wool, very warm, bright red, a bit\r\ncrude in workmanship here and there--but imagine a girl bothering, these\r\ndays! He donned the garment and decided it fit fine.\r\n\r\nThen he tried to write a letter:\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Nance! I've just put it on--first time--beautiful! It'll stay right\r\nwith me. Thanks. Talk about being staggered...\"\r\n\r\nThere he bogged down, some, wondering how much she had changed,\r\nwondering just what he ought to say to her, and who these characters\r\nthat he wouldn't remember, might be. Cripes, how old was she, now?\r\nSeventeen? He ended up taking her at her word. He described Pallastown\r\nrather heavy-handedly, and bought some microfilm postcards to go along\r\nwith his missive, as soon as he went out to mail it.\r\n\r\nBut a few hours later, from deep in space, he looked back at the Town,\r\nshining in the distance, and in the blue mood of thinking about Charlie\r\nReynolds, Mitch Storey, and Two-and-Two, he wondered how much longer it,\r\nor Nance, or anything else, could last. Then he glanced down at the\r\nbright sweater, and chuckled...\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, Ramos remained an active member of KRNH Enterprises for\r\nover a year. But the end had to come. \"I told Art I'd let my dough ride,\r\nFrank,\" he said to Nelsen in the lounge of Post One. \"I'll only draw\r\nenough earnings to build me a real, deep-space bubb, nuclear-propelled,\r\nand with certain extra gadgets. A few guys have tried to follow the\r\nunmanned, instrumented rockets, out to the system of Saturn. Nobody got\r\nback, yet. I think I know what they figured wrong. The instruments\r\nshowed--well, skip it... I'm going into Town to prepare. It'll take\r\nquite a while, so I'll have some fun, too.\"\r\n\r\nRamos' eyes twinkled with a secret triumph--before the fact.\r\n\r\n\"You don't argue a fighting rooster out of fighting,\" Nelsen laughed.\r\n\"Besides, it wouldn't be Destiny--or any fun--to succeed. So accept the\r\ncomplimentary comparison--if it fits--which maybe it doesn't, you\r\negotistical bonehead. Good luck--_buena suerte, amigo_. I'll look you up\r\nin Town, if I get a chance...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen was always busy to the gills. Progress was so smooth for another\r\ncouple of years, that the hunch of Big Trouble building up, became a\r\ngnawing certainty in his nerves.\r\n\r\nOf course there were always the Jolly Lads to watch out for--the extreme\r\nindividualists, space-twisted and wild. Robbing and murdering could seem\r\neasier than digging. Take your loot into Pallastown--who knew you hadn't\r\ngrubbed it, yourself? Sell it. Get the stink blown off you--forget some\r\nterrible things that had happened to you. Have yourself a time. Strike\r\nOut again. Repeat...\r\n\r\nNelsen knew that, through the months, he had killed defensively at least\r\ntwice. Once, with a long-range homing bullet--weapons sanctioned by\r\npious and cautious international agreement, were more lethal, now, to\r\nmatch the weapons of the predatory. Once by splitting a helmet with a\r\nrifle barrel. When he was out alone, exploring a new post site on a\r\nsmall asteroid, a starved Tovie runaway had jumped him. Maybe he should\r\nregret the end of that incident.\r\n\r\nTrips to Pallastown were increasingly infrequent. But there was one time\r\nwhen he almost had come specially to see Ramos' new bubb, still under\r\nwraps, supposedly. Well--that erratic character had it out on a long\r\ntest run. Damn him! As usual, time was crowding Nelsen. He had to get\r\nback on the job. He had just a couple of hours left.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a letter to Nance Codiss, answering one of hers--funny, he'd\r\nnever yet tried to contact her vocally. Being busy, being cautious about\r\nusing a beam--these were good reasons. Now there was hardly enough spare\r\ntime to reach twice across the light-minutes. Maybe the real truth was\r\nthat men got strangely shy in the silences of the Belt.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Nance: You seem to be making fine headway in your new courses. All\r\nthe good words, for that...\"\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of good words, but he didn't put many of them down. He\r\ndidn't know if the impulse to write _Darling_, was just his own\r\nloneliness, which any girl with a kind word would have filled. He didn't\r\nknow her, or that part of himself, very well. He kept remembering her as\r\nshe had been. Then he'd realize that memory wasn't a stable thing to\r\nhang onto. Everything changed--how well he had learned that! She was\r\nolder, now, intelligent, and at school again, studying some kind of\r\nmedical laboratory technology. Certainly she had become more\r\nsophisticated and elusive--her gay letters were just a superficial part\r\nof what she must be. And certainly there were dates and boyfriends, and\r\nall the usual phases of getting out of step with a mere recollection,\r\nlike himself. Nelsen had some achy emotions. Should he ask for her\r\npicture? Should he send one of himself?\r\n\r\nHe just scribbled on, ramblingly, as usual. Yep, in a new Archer Seven,\r\nyou could undo a few clamps, pull a foot up out of a boot, and actually\r\nchange your socks... Inconsequential nonsense like that. He ended by\r\ntelling her not to worry about any knicknacks he might send--that they\r\ncame easy, out here. He microposted the letter, and mailed a square of\r\nsoft glass-silk of many colors.\r\n\r\nThen he pronounced a few cuss words, laughed at himself for getting so\r\nserious, shrugged, and with the casualness of hopper with his pockets\r\nloaded, moved toward the rec area, which was some distance off.\r\n\r\nIt was night over this part of rapidly growing Pallastown. Moving along\r\na lighted causeway, he saw the man with the shovel teeth. Glory, had\r\n_he_ managed to survive so long? His mere presence, here, seemed like a\r\nsignal of the end of peace. Nelsen and Ramos used to practice\r\nclose-contact tactics at zero-G, in space. So Nelsen didn't even wait\r\nfor the man to notice him. He leaped, and sped like an arrow, thudding\r\ninto the guy's stomach with both of his boot heels. Shovel Teeth was\r\nhurled fifty yards backward, Nelsen hurtling with him all the way.\r\nUnless Nelsen wanted to kill him, there wasn't any more to do. Partial\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't worried about anybody except the guy's Jolly Lad henchmen.\r\nThere was nobody close by. Now he did a quick fade, sure that nobody had\r\nseen who he was, during the entire episode. No use to call the\r\ncops--there were too many uncertainties about the setup in wild,\r\npolyglot Pallastown. Nelsen moved on to the rec area.\r\n\r\nHe didn't go into a garishly splendid place, named _The Second Stop_.\r\nThus, he didn't see its owner, whose identity he had already heard\r\nabout, of course. Not that he wouldn't have liked to. But there wasn't\r\nany time to get involved in a long chat with a woman... Nor did he see\r\nthe tall, skinny, horse-faced comic, known only as Igor, go through\r\nslapstick acrobatics that once would have been impossible...\r\n\r\nBy a round-about route he proceeded to the catapults, where Gimp Hines\r\nwas waiting for him. They had been conversing just a short while ago.\r\n\r\n\"Did you drop in on Eileen?\" Gimp asked right away.\r\n\r\n\"No. There'll be other occasions,\" Nelsen laughed. \"Someday, if we live,\r\nshe'll own all the joints in the solar system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh--I'd bet on it... By the way, there's a grapevine yarn around.\r\nSomebody kicked Fanshaw--the Jolly Lad big-shot--in the belly. You,\r\nperhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't listen to gossip,\" Nelsen said primly. \"Are you serious about\r\ngoing to Mercury?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. There are people to take over my office duties. I'll be on\r\nmy way in a couple of weeks. I think you'd like to come along, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen felt an urge that was like a crying for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I would. But I'm bound to the wheel. Cripes, though--watch\r\nyourself, fella. Don't _you_ get into a mess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell--you're the mess specialist, Frank. Fanshaw isn't here for fun.\r\nAnd there's been that new trouble at home...\"\r\n\r\nA Tovie bubb, loaded with people, and a Stateside bubb, both in orbit\r\naround the Earth, had collided. No survivors. But there was plenty of\r\nblaming and counter-blaming. Another dangerous incident. Glory--with all\r\nthe massed destructive power there was, could luck really last forever?\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen got back to Post One, okay. But later, riding in to Post\r\nThree, just in an Archer Six, with a couple of guards for company, he\r\npicked up a long-lost voice, falsely sweet, then savage at the end:\r\n\r\n\"I'm a Jinx, aren't I, Frankie? A vulture. Nice and cavalier, you are. I\r\nbet you hoped I was dead. Okay--Sucker...!\"\r\n\r\nTiflin didn't even answer when Nelsen tried to beam him.\r\n\r\nNelsen was able to save Post Three. The guards and most of the personnel\r\nwere experienced and tough. They drove the Jolly Lads back and deflected\r\nsome chunks of aimed and accelerated asteroid chips, with new defense\r\nrockets.\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak, at Post Seven, wasn't so lucky, though Frank had tipped him\r\noff. Half of the post was scattered and pirated. Six fellas and the wife\r\nof one of them--a Bunch from Baltimore--were just drying shreds that\r\ndrifted in the wreckage. Big Joe, though he had a rocket chip through\r\nhis chest, had been able to beat off the attackers, with the help of a\r\nfew asteroid-hoppers and his novice crew which turned out to be more\r\nrugged than some people might have expected.\r\n\r\nFrank got to them just as it was over--except for the cursing, the\r\nmasculine tears of grief and rage, the promises of revenge. Luckily,\r\nnone of the women had been captured.\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak, full of new antibiotics and coagulants, was still up and\r\naround. \"So we knocked off a few of them, Frank,\" he said ruefully in\r\nhis office bubb. \"Several were in Tovie armor. Runaways, or agents?\r\nThey're crowding us, boy. Hell, what a junk heap this post is going to\r\nbe, to sort out...\"\r\n\r\n\"Get to it,\" Nelsen commented.\r\n\r\n\"You've got something in mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh. Coming in, I heard somebody address somebody else as Fan.\r\nFanshaw, that would be. And I kind of remembered his voice, as he\r\ncracked out orders. He was with this group. I'm going after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night...! I'll send some of my crowd along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope, Joe. They'd spot two or more guys. One, they won't even believe\r\nin. This is a lone-wolf deal. Besides, it's personal... Shucks--I don't\r\neven think there's a risk...\"\r\n\r\nThere, he knew he exaggerated--especially as, huddled up to resemble a\r\nsmall asteroid-fragment, he followed the retreating specks. His only\r\nweapon was a rapid-fire launcher, using small rockets loaded only with\r\nchemical explosive. He felt a tingle all through him. Scare, all right.\r\n\r\nAhead, as he expected, he saw three stolen bubbs blossom out. There'd be\r\na real pirates' party, like he'd seen, once. They'd have a lookout\r\nposted, of course. But the enormity of the Belt made them cocky. Who\r\ncould ever really police very much of it? One other advantage was that\r\nJolly Lads were untidy. Around the distant bubbs floated a haze of\r\njettisoned refuse. Boxes, wrappings, shreds of stellene. Nelsen had\r\nfigured on that.\r\n\r\nDecelerating, he draped a sheet of synthetic cellulose that he'd brought\r\nalong, loosely over his armored shape. Then he drifted unobtrusively\r\nclose. At a half-mile distance, he peered through the telescope sight of\r\nhis launcher. The bubbs were close together. The lookout floated free.\r\nHim, he got first, with a careful, homing shot.\r\n\r\nImmediately he fired a burst into each bubb, saw them collapse around\r\ntheir human contents. The men inside were like cats in limp bags, the\r\nexits of which could no longer be found. Calmly he picked the biggest\r\nlumps of struggling forms, and fired again and again, until there was no\r\nmore motion left except an even rotation.\r\n\r\nHe soon located Fanshaw. His unarmored body was bloated and drying, his\r\nmouth gaped, his shovel teeth were exposed to the stars and the distant,\r\nnaked sun. Nelsen had to think back to six dead young men and a girl, to\r\nkeep from feeling lousy. Had Fanshaw been just another guy invading a\r\nregion that was too big and terrible for humans?\r\n\r\nWith something like dread, Nelsen looked for Tiflin, too. But, of\r\ncourse, that worthy wasn't around.\r\n\r\nNelsen picked up some space-fitness cards. Quite a few nations were\r\nrepresented. Joe would have to turn in the cards to the respective\r\nauthorities. Noting its drift course, Nelsen left the wreckage, and\r\nhurried back to Post Seven, before other Jolly Lads could catch up and\r\navenge their pals.\r\n\r\n\"Fanshaw's groups will fight it out for a new leader, Joe,\" he said.\r\n\"That should keep them busy, for a while...\"\r\n\r\nSucceeding months were quieter. But the Tovies had lost no advantage.\r\nThey had Ceres, the biggest of the asteroids, and their colonies were\r\nmoving in on more and more others that were still untouched, closing\r\nthem, against all agreements, to any competition.\r\n\r\nThe new Archer Seven which Nelsen presently acquired, had a miniature TV\r\nscreen set in its collar. Afield, he was able to pick up propaganda\r\nbroadcasts from Ceres. They showed neat, orderly quarters, good food,\r\ngood facilities, everything done by command and plan. He wondered glumly\r\nif that was better for men who were pitted against space. The rigid\r\ndiscipline sheltered them. They didn't have to think in a medium that\r\nmight be too huge for their brains and emotions. Maybe it was more\r\npractical than rough-and-tumble individualism. He had a bitter picture\r\nof the whole solar system without a free mind in its whole extent--that\r\nis, if another gigantic blowup didn't happen first...\r\n\r\nNelsen didn't see Ramos' new bubb, nor did he see him leave for Saturn\r\nand its moons. The guy had avoided him, and gone secretive. But over a\r\nyear later, the news reached Nelsen at Post Eight. A man named Miguel\r\nRamos had got back, more dead than alive, after a successful venture,\r\nalone, to the immediate vicinity of the Ringed Planet. His vehicle was\r\nriddled. He was in a Pallastown hospital.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen delegated his duties, and went to see Ramos. The guy seemed\r\nhardly more than half-conscious. He had no hands left. His legs were off\r\nat the knee. Frostbite. Only the new antibiotics he had taken along, had\r\nkept the gangrene from killing him. There was a light safety belt across\r\nhis bed. But somehow he knew Nelsen. And his achievement seemed like a\r\nmechanical record fixed in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Frank,\" he whispered hurriedly. \"I figured it right. Out there,\r\nnear Saturn, clusters of particles of frozen methane gas are floating\r\nfree like tiny meteors. The instrumented rockets didn't run into them,\r\nand they were too light to show clearly on radar. But a bubb with a man\r\nin it is lots bigger, and can be hit and made like a sieve. That's what\r\nhappened to those who went first. Their Archers were pierced too. I had\r\nmine specially armored, with a heavy helmet and body plating... The\r\nparticles just got my gloves and my legs. Cripes, I got pictures--right\r\nfrom the rim of the Rings! And lots of data...\"\r\n\r\nRamos showed the shadow of a reckless grin of triumph. Then he passed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nLater, Nelsen saw the photographs, and the refrigerated box with the\r\nclear, plastic sides. Inside it was what looked like dirty, granular\r\nsnow--frozen water. Which was all it was. Unless the fact that it was\r\nalso the substance of Saturn's Rings made a difference.\r\n\r\nSaturn--another of the great, cold, largely gaseous planets, where it\r\nwould perhaps always be utterly futile for a man to try to land...\r\nRamos, the little Mex who chased the girls. Ramos, the hero, the\r\nhistorical figure, now...\r\n\r\nCursing under his breath, Nelsen wandered vaguely to _The Second Stop_.\r\nThere, he saw what probably every spaceman had dreamed of. Lucette of\r\nParis swimming nude in a gigantic dewdrop--possible where gravity was\r\nalmost nil. Music played. Beams of colored light swung majestically,\r\nwith prismatic effects through the great, flattened, shimmering ovoid of\r\nwater, while Lucette's motions completed a beautiful legend...\r\n\r\nTwo figures moved past Nelsen in the darkened interior. The first one\r\nwas tall and lean. Then he saw the profile of a lean face with a bent\r\nnose, heard a mockingly apologetic \"Oh-oh...\" and didn't quite realize\r\nthat this was Tiflin, the harbinger of misfortune, before it was too\r\nlate to collar him. Nelsen followed as soon as he could push his way\r\nfrom the packed house. But pursuit was hopeless in the crowded causeway\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, he was in Eileen Sands' apartment. It was not his\r\nfirst visit. Eileen seldom danced or sang, anymore, herself. She was\r\ndifferent, now. She wore an evening dress--soft blue, tasteful. Here,\r\nshe was the cool, poised owner, the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Tiflin hasn't been around here for a long time, Frank,\" she was saying.\r\n\"You know that his buddy entertained for me for a while. I have an\r\ninterested nature, but Tiflin never gave me anything but wisecracks.\r\nThere are lots of Tovies around--there's even a center for runaways. I\r\ndon't ask questions of customers usually. And technically, all I can\r\nrequire of a comic is talent. This Igor had a certain kind. What is the\r\ndifficulty now?\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen looked at Eileen almost wearily for a second. \"Just that\r\nTiflin is somehow involved with most of the bad luck that I've ever had\r\nout here,\" he said, grimly. \"And if Pallastown were destroyed, everybody\r\nbut the Tovies might as well go home from the Belt. The timing seems to\r\nme to be about right. They'd risk it, feeling we're too scared to strike\r\nback at home. The Jolly Lads--who are international--could be encouraged\r\nto do the job for them.\"\r\n\r\nSudden hollows showed in Eileen's cheeks. \"What are you going to do?\"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much for me to do,\" he answered. \"I only happened to notice,\r\nwhile I was coming in to Pallas, that all the guard stations, extending\r\nway out, were quietly very alert. But is that enough? Well, if they\r\ncan't cope with an attack, what good am I? We're vulnerable, here. I\r\nguess we just sit tight and wait.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly. \"All right--let's. Sit, relax, converse. Stop being\r\nthe Important Personage for a while, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look who's talking. Okay--what do you know that's new to tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few things. I keep track of most everybody.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her slender hand, brown in his angular fist, that was pale from\r\nhis space gloves. \"Gimp, first,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Still on Mercury, with Two-and-Two. Two-and-Two was a bricklayer, a\r\ngood beginning for a construction man. That seems to be paying off, as\r\ncolonists move in. Gimp is setting up solar power stations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encouraging information, for once. Here's a hard one--Jig Hollis. The\r\nreal intelligent man who stayed home. I've envied him for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmmm--yes, Frank. Intelligent, maybe--but he never quite believed it,\r\nhimself. His wife stayed with him, even after he turned real sour and\r\nreckless. One night he hit a big oak tree with his car. Now, he is just\r\nas dead as if he had crashed into the sun at fifty miles per second. He\r\ncouldn't take knowing that he was scared to do what he wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" Nelsen said flatly.\r\n\r\n\"Now who else should I gossip about?\" Eileen questioned. \"Oh, yes--Harv\r\nDiamond, hero of our lost youth, who got space fatigue. Well, he\r\nrecovered and returned to active duty in the U.S.S.F. Which perhaps\r\nleaves me with just my own love life to confess.\" She smiled lightly.\r\n\"Once there was a kid named Frankie Nelsen, who turned out to be a very\r\nconscientious jerk. Since then, there have been scads of rugged,\r\nromantic characters on all sides... You're going to ask about Miguel\r\nRamos.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, looked unhappy and tired. \"The celebrity,\" she said. \"Mashed\r\nup. But he'll recover--this time. I've seen him--sent him flowers, sat\r\nbeside him. But what do you do with a clown like that? Lock him in the\r\ncloset or look at him through a telescope? Goodbye--hello--goodbye. A\r\nkid with gaudy banners flying, if he lives to be forty--which he never\r\nwill. They'll be giving him artificial hands and feet, and he'll be\r\ntrying for Pluto. A friend. I guess I'm proud. That's all. Anything else\r\nyou want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. There was a cute little girl at Serene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jennie Harper. She married one of those singing Moon prospectors.\r\nSomebody murdered them both--way out on Far Side.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's mouth twisted. \"That's enough, pal,\" he said. \"I better\r\ngo do my sitting tight someplace else. Keep your Archer handy. Thanks,\r\nand see you...\"\r\n\r\nWithin forty minutes David Lester was showing him some pictures that a\r\nhopper had brought in from a vault in a surface-asteroid.\r\n\r\nOn the screen, great, mottled shapes moved through a lush forest.\r\nThousands of tiny, flitting bat-like creatures--miniature pterodactyls\r\nof the terrestrial Age of Reptiles--hovered over a swamp, where millions\r\nof insects hung like motes in the light of the low sun. A much larger\r\npterodactyl, far above, glided gracefully over a cliff, and out to sea,\r\nits long, beaked head turning watchfully.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Nelsen said mildly, as his jaded mind responded.\r\n\r\nLester nodded. \"_They_ were on Earth, too--as the Martians must have\r\nbeen--exploring and taking pictures, during the Cretaceous Period. Oh,\r\nbut there's a perhaps even better sequence! Like the Martians, they had\r\na world-wrecking missile, which they were building in space. Spherical.\r\nAbout six miles in diameter, I calculate. Shall I show you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No... I think I'll toddle over to the offices, Les. Keep wearing those\r\nArchers, people. Glad the kid likes to play in his...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen had donned his own Seven, with the helmet fastened across his\r\nchest by a strap. At the KRNH office, there was a letter, which luckily\r\nhadn't been sent out to Post Eight. The tone was more serious than that\r\nof any that Nance Codiss had sent before.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Frank: I'm actually coming your way. I'll be stopping to work at\r\nthe Survey Station Hospital on Mars for two months en route...\"\r\n\r\nHe read that far when he heard the sirens and saw the flashes of\r\ndefending batteries that were trying to ward off missiles from\r\nPallastown. He latched his helmet in place. He was headed for the\r\nunderground galleries when the first impacts came. He saw four domes\r\nvanish in flashes of fire. Then he didn't run anymore. He had his small\r\nrocket launcher, from the office. If they ever came close enough... But\r\nof course they'd stay thousands of miles off. He got to the nearest\r\nfallen dome as fast as he could. Everybody had been in armor, but there\r\nwere over a hundred dead. Emergency and rescue crews were operating\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\nHe glanced around for indications. No explosive, chemical or nuclear,\r\nhad yet been used. But there was the old Jolly Lad trick: Accelerate a\r\nchunk of asteroid-material to a speed of several miles per second by\r\ngrasping it with your gloved hands, while the shoulder-ionic of your\r\narmor was at full power. Start at a great distance, aim your missile\r\nwith your body, let it go... Impact would be sheer, blasting\r\nincandescence. A few hundred chunks of raw metal could finish\r\nPallastown... Were these just crazy, wild slobs whooping it up, or real\r\ncrud provided with a purpose and reward? Either way, here was the\r\neternal danger to any Belt settlement.\r\n\r\nNelsen could have tried to reach an escape-exit into open space, but he\r\nhelped with the injured while he waited for more impacts to come. There\r\nwas another series of deflecting flashes from the defense batteries. Two\r\nmore domes vanished... Then--somehow--nothing more. Evidently some of\r\nthe attackers had been only half hearted, _this time_. Reprieve...\r\n\r\nAlmost four hundred people were dead. It could have been the whole Town.\r\nThen spreading disaster. All Nelsen's friends were okay. The Posts\r\ncalled in--okay, too. Nelsen waited three days. He wanted to help\r\ndefend, if the attack was renewed. But now the U.N.S.F. was\r\nconcentrating in the vicinity. For a while, things would be quiet, Out\r\nHere. Just the same, he felt kind of fed up. He felt as if the end of\r\neverything he knew had crept inevitably a little closer.\r\n\r\nHe beamed Mars--the Survey Station. He contacted Nance. He had known\r\nthat she should have arrived already. He was relieved. He knew what the\r\nregion between here and there could be like when there was trouble.\r\n\r\n\"It's me--Frank Nelsen--Nance,\" he said into his helmet-phone, as he\r\nstood beyond the outskirts of the Town, on the barren, glittering\r\nsurface of Pallas. \"I'm still wearing the sweater. Stay where you are.\r\nI've never been on Mars, either. But I'll be there, soon...\"\r\n\r\nHis old uncertainties about talking to her evaporated now that he was\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\n\"For Pete's sake--Frank!\" he heard her laugh happily, still sounding\r\nlike the neighbor kid. \"Gosh, it's good to hear you!\"\r\n\r\nHe left for Post One, soon after that. Nowadays, it was almost a\r\nminiature of the ever more magnificent--if insecure--Pallastown. He kept\r\nthinking angrily of Art Kuzak, getting a little overstuffed, it seemed.\r\nThe hunkie kid, the ex-football player who had become a big commercial\r\nand industrial baron of the Belt. Easy living. Cuties around. And poor\r\ntwin Joe--just another stooge...\r\n\r\nNelsen went into the office, his fists clenched overdramatically. \"I'm\r\ntaking a leave, Art--maybe a long one,\" he said.\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak stared at him. \"You damned, independent bums--you, too,\r\nNelsen!\" he began to growl. But when he saw Nelsen's jaw harden, he got\r\nthe point, and grinned, instead. \"Okay, Frank. Nobody's indispensible. I\r\nmight do the same when you come back--who knows...?\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen joined a KRNH bubb convoy--Earthbound, but also passing\r\nfairly close to Mars--within a few hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen meant the journey to be vagabond escape, an interlude of to\r\nhell with it relief from the grind, and from the increasingly uncertain\r\nmainstream of the things he knew best.\r\n\r\nHe rode with a long train of bubbs and great sheaves of smelted metal\r\nrods--tungsten, osmium, uranium 238. The sheaves had their own\r\npropelling ionic motors. He lazed like a tramp. He talked with\r\nasteroid-hoppers who meant to spend some time on Earth. Several had\r\nbecome almost rich. Most had strong, quiet faces that showed both\r\ndistance- and home-hunger. A few had broken, and the angry sensitivity\r\nwas visible.\r\n\r\nNelsen treated himself well. He was relieved of the duty of eternal\r\nvigilance by men whose job it was. So, for a while, his purpose was\r\nalmost successful.\r\n\r\nBut the memory--or ghost--of Mitch Storey was never quite out of his\r\nmind. And, as a tiny, at first telescopic crescent with a rusty light\r\nenlarged with lessened distance ahead, the ugly enigma of present-day\r\nMars dug deeper into his brain.\r\n\r\nEvery twenty-four hours and thirty-eight minutes--the length of the\r\nMartian day--whenever the blue-green wedge of Syrtis Major appeared in\r\nthe crescent, he beamed the Survey Station, which was still maintained\r\nfor the increase of knowledge, and as a safeguard for incautious\r\nadventurers who will tackle any dangerous mystery or obstacle. His\r\nobject was to talk to Nance Codiss.\r\n\r\n\"I thought perhaps you and your group had gotten restless and had\r\nstarted out for the Belt already,\" he laughed during their first\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no--a lab technician like me is far too busy here, for one thing,\"\r\nshe assured him, her happy tone bridging the distance. \"We came this far\r\nwith a well-armed freight caravan, in good passenger quarters. If we\r\nwent on, I suppose it would be the same... Anyway, for years you didn't\r\nworry much about me. Why now, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mystery,\" he teased in return. \"Or perhaps because I considered Earth\r\nsafe--instinctively.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was right in the first place. It _was_ a mystery--something to do\r\nwith the startling news that she was on the way, that closer friendship\r\nwas pending. The impulse to go meet her had been his first, almost\r\nthoughtless impulse.\r\n\r\nHe was still glad that she wasn't out between Mars and the Belt, where\r\ndisaster had once hit him hard. But now he wondered if the Survey\r\nStation was any better for anybody, even though it was reputed to be\r\nquite secure.\r\n\r\nThe caravan he rode approached his destination no closer than ten\r\nmillion miles. Taking cautious note of radar data which indicated that\r\nspace all around was safely empty, he cast off in his Archer with a\r\nsmall, new, professional-type bubb packed across his hips. Inside his\r\nhelmet he lighted a cigarette--quite an unusual luxury.\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to reach Phobos. They gave him shots there--new\r\npreventative medicine that was partially effective against the viruses\r\nof Mars. Descent in the winged rocket was rough. But then he was gliding\r\nwith a sibilant whistle through a natural atmosphere, again. Within\r\nminutes he was at the Station--low, dusty domes, many of them deserted,\r\nnow, at the edge of the airfield, a lazily-spinning wind gauge,\r\ntractors, auto-jeeps, several helicopters.\r\n\r\nHe stepped down with his gear. Mars was all around him: A few\r\nground-clinging growths nearby--harmless, locally evolved vegetation.\r\nDistant, coppery cliffs reflecting the setting sun. Ancient excavations\r\nnotched them. Dun desert to the east, with little plumes of dust\r\nblowing. Through his Archer--a necessary garment here not only because\r\nthe atmosphere was only one-tenth as dense as Earth-air and poor in\r\noxygen, but because of the microscopic dangers it bore--Nelsen could\r\nhear the faint sough of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-eight percent of terrestrial gravity actually seemed strong\r\nto him now, and made him awkward, as he turned and looked west. Perhaps\r\ntwo miles off, past a barbed-wire fence and what must be an old tractor\r\ntrail of the hopeful days of colonization, he saw the blue-green edge of\r\nSyrtis Major, the greatest of the thickets, with here and there a\r\njutting spur of it projecting toward him along a gully. Nelsen's hide\r\ntingled. But his first glimpse was handicapped by distance. He saw only\r\nan expanse of low shagginess that might have been scrub growths of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nDug into the salt-bearing ground at intervals, he knew, were the fire\r\nweapons ready to throw oxygen and synthetic napalm--jellied gasoline.\r\nNever yet had they been discharged, along this defense line. But you\r\ncould never be sure just what might be necessary here.\r\n\r\nA man of about thirty had approached. \"I meet the new arrivals,\" he\r\nsaid. \"If you'll come along with me, Mr. Nelsen...\"\r\n\r\nHe was dark, and medium large, and he had a genial way. He looked like a\r\nhopper--an asteroid-miner--the tough, level-headed kind that adjusts to\r\nspace and keeps his balance.\r\n\r\n\"Name's Ed Huth,\" he continued, as they walked to the reception dome.\r\n\"Canadian. Good, international crowd here--however long you mean to\r\nstay. Most interesting frontier in the solar system, too. Probably\r\nyou've heard most of the rules and advice. But here's a paper. Refresh\r\nyour memory by reading it over as soon as you can. There is one thing\r\nwhich I am required to show everybody who comes here. Inside this peek\r\nbox. You are instructed to take a good look.\"\r\n\r\nHuth's geniality had vanished.\r\n\r\nThe metal box was a yard high, and twice as long and wide. It stood,\r\nlike a memorial, before the reception dome entrance. A light shone\r\nbeyond the glass-covered slot, as Nelsen bent to peer.\r\n\r\nHe had seen horror before now. He had seen a pink mist dissolve in the\r\nsunshine as a man in armor out in the Belt was hit by an explosive\r\nmissile, his blood spraying and boiling. Besides, he had read up on the\r\nthickets of Mars, watched motion pictures, heard Gimp Hines' stories of\r\nhis brief visit here. So, at first, he could be almost casual about what\r\nhe saw in the peek box. There were many ghastly ways for a man to die.\r\n\r\nEven the thicket plant in the box seemed dead, though Nelsen knew that\r\nplant successors to the original Martians had the rugged power of\r\nrevival. This one showed the usual paper-dry whorls or leaves, and the\r\nusual barrel-body, perhaps common to arid country growths, everywhere.\r\nScattered over the barrel, between the spines, were glinting\r\nspecks--vegetable, light-sensitive cells developed into actual visual\r\norgans. The plant had the usual tympanic pods of its kind--a band of\r\nmuscle-like tissue stretched across a hollow interior--by which it could\r\nmake buzzing sounds. Nelsen knew that, like any Earthly green plant, it\r\nproduced oxygen, but that, instead of releasing it, it stored the gas in\r\nspongy compartments within its horny shell, using it to support an\r\nanimal-like tissue combustion to keep its vitals from freezing during\r\nthe bitterly frigid nights.\r\n\r\nNelsen also knew that deeper within the thing was a network of whitish\r\npulp, expanded at intervals to form little knobs. Sectioned, under a\r\nmicroscope, they would look like fibred masses of animal or human nerve\r\nand brain cells, except that, chemically, they were starch and cellulose\r\nrather than protein.\r\n\r\nWorst to see was the rigid clutch of monster's tactile organs, which\r\ngrew from the barrel's crown. It was like a powerful man struggling to\r\nuproot a rock, or a bear or an octopus crushing an enemy. It was\r\ndark-hole drama, like something from another galaxy. Like some horribly\r\neffective piece of sculpture, the tableau in the box preserved the last\r\ngasp of an incautious youth in armor.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils of the thicket plant were furred with erect spines of a\r\nshiny, russet color. They were so fine that they looked almost soft. But\r\nNelsen was aware that they were sharper than the hypodermic needles they\r\nresembled--in another approach to science. Now, Nelsen felt the tingling\r\nrevulsion and hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you know that you don't have to get caught like that poor\r\nbloke did,\" Huth said dryly. \"Just not to disinfect the outside of your\r\nArcher well enough and then leave it near you, indoors, is sufficient.\r\nI was here before there was any trouble. When it came, it was a\r\nshambles...\"\r\n\r\nHuth eyed Nelsen for a moment, then continued on another tack.\r\n\"Biology... Given the whole universe to experiment in, I suppose you can\r\nnever know what it will come up with--or what is possible. These\r\ndevils--you get to hate them in your sleep. If their flesh--or their\r\nmethods--were something like ours, as was the case with the original\r\nMartians or the people of the Asteroid Planet, it wouldn't seem so bad.\r\nStill, they make you wonder: What would you do, if, in your own way, you\r\ncould think and observe, but were rooted to the ground; if you were\r\ndenied the animal ability of rapid motion, if you didn't have hands with\r\nwhich to fashion tools or build apparatus, if fire was something you\r\ncould scarcely use?...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen smiled. \"I _am_ wondering,\" he said. \"I promise to do a lot more\r\nof it as soon as I get squared away. I could inflate my bubb, and sleep\r\nin the yard in it, if I had to. Then, as usual, off the Earth, you'll\r\nexpect me to earn my breathing air and keep, after a couple of days,\r\nwhether I can pay instead or not. That's fine with me, of course.\r\nThere's another matter which I'd like to discuss, but that can be\r\nlater.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sleeping out,\" Huth laughed. \"That's just where people get careless.\r\nThere are plenty of quarters available since the retreat of settlers\r\nalmost emptied this world of terrestrial intrusion--except for us here\r\nand the die-hard desert rats, and the new, screwball adventurers... By\r\nthe way, if it ever becomes important, the deserts are safe--at least\r\nfrom what you just saw--as you probably know...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen passed through an airlock, where live steam and a special\r\nsilicone oil accomplished the all-important disinfection of his Archer,\r\nhis bubb, and the outside of his small, sealed baggage roll. Armor and\r\nbubb he left racked with rows of others.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't till he got into the reception dome lounge that he saw Nance\r\nCodiss. She didn't rush at him. Reserve had dropped over them both again\r\nas if in reconsideration of a contact made important too suddenly. He\r\nclasped her fingers, then just stood looking at her. Lately, they had\r\nexchanged a few pictures.\r\n\r\n\"Your photographs don't lie, Nance,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Yours do, Frank,\" she answered with complete poise. \"You look a lot\r\nless grim and tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" he told her. \"I'll be right back...\"\r\n\r\nHe went with Ed Huth to ditch his roll in his sleeping cubicle, get\r\ncleaned up and change his clothes.\r\n\r\nShe _was_ beautiful, she had grave moods, she was wearing his fabulous\r\nbracelet--if only not to offend him. But when he returned, he met two of\r\nthe girls who had come out to Mars with her--a nurse and another lab\r\ntechnician. They were the bubbly type, full of bravado and giggles for\r\ntheir strange, new surroundings. For a moment he felt far too old at\r\ntwenty-four for Nance's twenty. He wondered regretfully if her being\r\nhere was no more than part of his excuse for getting away from the Belt\r\nand from the sense of ultimate human disaster building up.\r\n\r\nBut much of his feeling of separation from her disappeared as they sat\r\nalone in the lounge, talking--first about Jarviston, then about here.\r\nNance had available information about the thickets pretty well down pat.\r\n\r\n\"You can't keep those plants alive here at the Station, Frank,\" she said\r\nquietly. \"They make study difficult by dying. It's as if they knew that\r\nthey couldn't win here. So they retreat--to keep their secrets. But Dr.\r\nPacetti, our head of Medical Research, says that we can never know that\r\nthey won't find a way to attack us directly. That's what the waiting\r\nnapalm line is for. I don't think he is exaggerating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" Nelsen asked.\r\n\r\nHe was encouraging her, of course. But he wasn't being patronizing.\r\nFrost tingled in his nerves. He wanted to know her version.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you the little museum we have,\" she replied, her eyes\r\nwidening slightly. \"This is probably old hat to you--but it's weird--it\r\ngives you the creeps...\"\r\n\r\nHe followed her along a covered causeway to another dome. In a gallery\r\nthere, a series of dry specimens were set up, inside sealed boxes made\r\nof clear plastic.\r\n\r\nThe first display was centered around a tapered brass tube--perhaps one\r\nof the barrels of an antique pair of fieldglasses. Wrapping it was a\r\nspiny brown tendril from which grew two sucker-like organs, shaped like\r\nacorn tops. One was firmly attached to the metal. The other had been\r\npulled free, its original position on the barrel marked by a circular\r\narea of corrosion. The face of the detached sucker was also shown--a\r\nhoneycomb structure of waxy vegetable tissue, detailed with thousands of\r\ntiny ducts and hairlike feelers.\r\n\r\n\"Some settler dropped the piece of brass out on a trail in Syrtis\r\nMajor,\" Nance explained. \"Later, it was found like this. Brass is\r\nsomething that people have almost stopped using. So, it was new to\r\n_them_. They wouldn't have been interested in magnesium, aluminum, or\r\nstainless steel anymore. The suckers aren't a usual part of them either.\r\nBut the suckers grow--for a special purpose, Dr. Pacetti believes. A\r\ntest--perhaps an analysis. They exude an acid, to dissolve a little of\r\nthe metal. It's like a human chemist working. Only, perhaps,\r\nbetter--more directly--with specialized feelers and sensing organs.\"\r\n\r\nNance's quiet voice had a slight, awed quaver at the end.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen nodded. He had examined printed pictures and data before\r\nthis. But here the impact was far more real and immediate; the impact of\r\nstrange minds with an approach of their own was more emphatic.\r\n\r\n\"What else?\" he urged.\r\n\r\nThey stood before another sealed case containing a horny, oval pod, cut\r\nopen. It had closed around a lump of greenish stone.\r\n\r\n\"Malachite,\" Nance breathed. \"One kind of copper ore. _They_ reduced it,\r\nextracted some of the pure metal. See all the little reddish specks\r\nshining? It is pretty well established that the process is something\r\nlike electroplating. There's a dissolving acid--then a weak electric\r\ncurrent--from a kind of battery... Oh, nobody should laugh, Frank--Dr.\r\nPacetti keeps pointing out that there are electric eels on Earth, with\r\nspecialized muscle-tissue that acts as an electric cell... But this is\r\nsomewhat different. Don't ask me exactly how it functions--I only heard\r\nour orientation lecture, while we toured this museum. But see those\r\nsmall compartments in the thick shells of the pod--with the membranes\r\nseparating them? All of them contained fluids--some acid, others\r\nalkaline. Mixed in with the cellulose of the membranes, you can see both\r\nsilvery and reddish specks--as if _they_ had to incorporate both a\r\nconductor and a difference of metals to get a current. At least, that\r\nwas what was suggested in the lecture...\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen and Nance Codiss moved on from display case to display\r\ncase, each of which showed another kind of pod cut in half. The\r\ninteriors were all different and all complicated... Membranes with a\r\nfaint, metallic sheen--laminated or separated by narrow air spaces as in\r\na capacitor, for instance... Balls of massed fibre, glinting... Curious,\r\nspiral formations of waxy tissue...\r\n\r\n\"They use electricity as a minor kind of defense,\" Nance went on, her\r\ntone still low with suppressed excitement that was close to dread. \"We\r\nknow that some of them can give you a shock--if you're fool enough to\r\nget so close that you can touch them. And they do emit radio impulses on\r\ncertain wavelengths. Signals--communication...? As for the rest, perhaps\r\nyou'd better do your own guessing, Frank. But the difference between us\r\nand them seems to be that we _make_ our apparatus. They _grow_ them,\r\n_build_ them--with their own living tissue cells--in a way that must be\r\nunder their constant, precise control. I suppose they even work from a\r\ncarefully thought-out design--a kind of cryptic blueprint... Go along\r\nwith the idea--or not--as you choose. But our experts suspect that much\r\nof what we have here represents research apparatus--physical, chemical,\r\nelectrical. That _they_ may get closer to understanding the ultimate\r\nstructure of matter than we can, because their equipment is part of\r\nthemselves, in which they can develop senses that we don't possess...\r\nWell, I'll skip any more of that. Because the best--or the worst--is\r\nstill coming. Right here, Frank...\"\r\n\r\nThe case showed several small, urn-like growths, sectioned like the\r\nother specimens.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen grinned slightly. \"All right--let me tell it,\" he said.\r\n\"Because this is something I really paid attention to! Like you imply,\r\ntheir equipment is alive. So they work best with life--viruses, germs,\r\nvegetable-allergy substances. These are their inventing, developing and\r\nbrewing bottles--for the numerous strains of Syrtis Fever virus. The\r\nliving molecule chains split off from the inner tissue walls of the\r\nbottles, and grow and multiply in the free fluid. At least, that's how I\r\nread it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is where my lab job begins, Frank,\" she told him. \"Helping\r\ndevelop anti-virus shots--testing them on bits of human tissue, growing\r\nin a culture bath. An even partially effective anti-virus isn't found\r\neasily. And when it is, another virus strain will soon appear, and the\r\ndoctors have to start over... Oh, the need isn't as great, any more, as\r\nwhen the Great Rush away from Mars was on. There are only half a dozen\r\nreally sick people in the hospital now. Late comers and snoopers who got\r\ncareless or curious. You've got to remember that the virus blows off the\r\nthickets like invisible vapor. There's one guy from Idaho--Jimmy--James\r\nScanlon. Come along. I'll show you, Frank...\"\r\n\r\nHe lay behind plastic glass, in a small cubicle. A red rash, with the\r\npattern of frostwork on a Minnesota windowpane in January, was across\r\nhis lean, handsome face. Maybe he was twenty--Nance's age. His bloodshot\r\neyes stared at terrors that no one else could see.\r\n\r\nNance called softly through the thin infection barrier. \"Jimmy!\"\r\n\r\nHe moaned a little. \"Francy...\"\r\n\r\n\"High fever, Frank,\" Nance whispered. \"Typical Syrtis. He wants to be\r\nhome--with his girl. I guess you know that nostalgia--yearning terribly\r\nfor old, familiar surroundings--is a major symptom. It's like a command\r\nfrom _them_--to get out of Mars. The red rash is something extra he\r\npicked up. An allergy... Oh, we think he'll survive. Half of them now\r\ndo. He's big and strong. Right now, even the nurses don't go in there,\r\nexcept in costumes that are as infection-tight as armor. Later on, when\r\nthe fever dwindles to chronic intermittence, it will no longer be\r\ncontagious. Even so, the new laws on Earth won't let him return there\r\nfor a year. I don't know whether such laws are fair or not. We've got a\r\nhundred here, who were sick, and are now stranded and waiting, working\r\nat small jobs. Others have gone to the Belt--which seems terrible for\r\nsomeone not quite well. I hope that Jimmy bears up all right--he's such\r\na kid... Let's get out of here...\"\r\n\r\nHer expression was gently maternal. Or maybe it was something more?\r\n\r\nBack in the lounge, she asked, \"What will you do here, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is, there is one thing I want to include,\" he answered. \"I\r\nwant to try to find out just what happened to Mitch Storey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Natch. I remember him. So I looked the incident up. He disappeared,\r\ndeep in Syrtis Major, over three years ago. He had carried a sick\r\nsettler in--on foot. He always seemed lucky or careful, or smart. After\r\nhe got lost, his wife--a nurse from here whose name had been Selma\r\nWashington--went looking for him. She never was found either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" Nelsen said in mild startlement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes... Talk to Ed Huth. There still are helicopter patrols--watching\r\nfor signs of a long list of missing people, and keeping tabs on late\r\ncomers who might turn out to be screwballs. You look as though you might\r\nbe Ed's type for that kind of work... I'll have to go, now, Frank. Duty\r\nin half an hour...\"\r\n\r\nHuth was grinning at him a little later. \"This department doesn't like\r\nmen who have a vanished friend, Nelsen,\" he said. \"It makes their\r\napproach too heroically personal. On the other hand, some of our lads\r\nseem underzealous, nowadays... If you can live up to your successful\r\nrecord in the Belt, maybe you're the right balance. Let's try you.\"\r\n\r\nFor a week, about all Nelsen did was ride along with Huth in the heli.\r\nAt intervals, he'd call, \"Mitch... Mitch Storey...!\" into his\r\nhelmet-phone. But, of course, that was no use.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't say that he didn't see Mars--from a safe altitude of two\r\nthousand feet: The vast, empty deserts where, fairly safe from the\r\npresent dominant form of Martian life, a few adventurers and\r\narcheologists still rummaged among the rust heaps of climate control and\r\nother machines, and among the blasted debris of glazed ceramic\r\ncities--still faintly tainted with radioactivity--where the original\r\ninhabitants had died. The straight ribbons of thicket growths, crossing\r\neven the deserts, carrying in their joined, hollow roots the irrigation\r\nwater of the otherwise mythical \"canals.\" The huge south polar cap of\r\nhoarfrost melting, blackening the soil with brief moisture, while the\r\nfrost line retreated toward the highlands. Syrtis, itself, where the\r\ntrails, once burned out with oxygen and gasoline-jelly to permit the\r\npassage of vehicles, had again become completely overgrown--who could\r\nhope to stamp out that devilishly hardy vegetation, propagating by means\r\nof millions of windblown spores, with mere fire? The broken-down trains\r\nof tractors and trailers, now almost hidden. The stellene garden domes\r\nthat had flattened. Here were the relics left by people who had sought\r\nto spread out to safety, to find old goals of freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nSeveral times in Syrtis, Huth and Nelsen descended, using a barren\r\nhillock or an isolated spot of desert as a landing area. That was when\r\nNelsen first heard the buzzing of the growths.\r\n\r\nTwice, working warily with machetes, and holding their flame weapons\r\nready, they chopped armored mummies from enwrapping tendrils, while\r\nlittle eye cells glinted at them balefully, and other tendrils bent\r\nslowly toward them. They searched out the space-fitness cards, which\r\nbore old dates, and addresses of next of kin.\r\n\r\nIn a few more days, Nelsen was flying the 'copter. Then he was out on\r\nhis own, watching, searching. For a couple of weeks he hangared the heli\r\nat once, after each patrol, and Nance always was there to meet him as he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\nInevitably the evening came when he said, \"We could fly out again,\r\nNance. For an hour or two. It doesn't break any rules.\"\r\n\r\nThose evening rides, high over Syrtis Major, toward the setting sun,\r\nbecame an every other day custom, harmless in itself. A carefully kept\r\nnuclear-battery motor didn't conk; the vehicle could almost fly without\r\nguidance. It was good to look down at the blue-green shagginess,\r\nbelow... Familiarity bred, not contempt, but a decline of dread to the\r\npoint where it became a pleasant thrill--an overtone to the process of\r\nfalling in love. Otherwise, perhaps they led each other on, into\r\nincaution. Out in the lonely fastnesses of Mars they seemed to find the\r\nsort of peace and separation from danger on the hectic Earth that the\r\nsettlers had sought here.\r\n\r\n\"We always pass over that same hill,\" Nance said during one of their\r\nflights. \"It must have been a beautiful little island in the ancient\r\nocean, when there was that much water. Now it belongs to us, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's barren--we could land,\" Nelsen suggested quickly.\r\n\r\nThey visited the hill a dozen times safely, breaking no printed rule.\r\nBut maybe they shouldn't have come so often to that same place. In life\r\nthere is always a risk--which is food for a fierce soul. Frank Nelsen\r\nand Nance Codiss were fierce souls.\r\n\r\nThey'd stand by the heli and look out over Syrtis, their gloved fingers\r\nentwined. If they couldn't kiss, here, through their helmets, that was\r\nmerely comic pathos--another thing to laugh and be happy over.\r\n\r\n\"Our wind-blown hill,\" Nance chuckled on that last evening. \"Looking\r\ndown over a culture, a history--maybe arguments, lawsuits, jokes,\r\nparties; gossip too, for all we know--disguised as a huge briar patch\r\nthat makes funny noises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up--I love you,\" Nelsen gruffed.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up yourself--it's you I love,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nThe little sun was half sunk behind the Horizon. The 'copter was only a\r\nhundred feet away, along the hillcrest. That was when it happened. Two\r\ndull, plopping sounds came almost together.\r\n\r\nIf a thinking animal can use the pressure of a confined gas to propel\r\nsmall missiles, is there any reason why other intelligences can't do the\r\nsame? From two bottle-like pods the clusters of darts--or long, sharp\r\nthorns--were shot. Only a few of them struck their targets. Fewer,\r\nstill, found puncturable areas and struck through silicone rubber and\r\nfine steelwire cloth into flesh. Penetration was not deep, but deep\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nNance screamed. Nelsen wasn't at all sure that he didn't scream himself\r\nas the first anguish dizzied and half blinded him.\r\n\r\nFrom the start it was really too late. Nelsen was as hardy and\r\ndetermined as any. He tried to get Nance to the 'copter. Less than\r\nhalfway, she crumpled. With a savage effort of will he managed to drag\r\nher a few yards, before his legs refused to obey him, or support him.\r\n\r\nHis blood carried a virus to his brain about as quickly as it would have\r\ncarried a cobra's venom. _They_ probably could have made such\r\nprotein-poisons, too; but they had never used them against men, no doubt\r\nbecause something that could spread and infect others was better.\r\n\r\nFor a while, as the black, starshot night closed in, Nelsen knew, or\r\nremembered, nothing at all--unless the mental distortions were too\r\nhorrible. Then he seemed to be in a pit of stinking, viscous fluid,\r\nalive with stringy unknowns that were boring into him... Unreachable in\r\nanother universe was a town called Jarviston. He yelled till his wind\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nHe had a half-lucid moment in which he knew it was night, and understood\r\nthat he had a raging fever. He was still clinging to Nance, who clung to\r\nhim. So instinct still worked. He saw that they had blundered--its black\r\nbulk was visible against the stars. Phobos hadn't risen; Deimos, the\r\nfarther moon, was too small to furnish appreciable light.\r\n\r\nSomething touched him from behind, and he recoiled, pushing Nance back.\r\nHe yanked the machete from his belt, and struck blindly... Oh,\r\n_no!_--you didn't get caught like this--not usually, he told himself.\r\nNot in their actual grip! They were too slow--you could always dodge! It\r\nwas only when you were near something not properly disinfected that you\r\ngot Syrtis Fever, which was the worst that could happen--wasn't it...?\r\n\r\nHe heard an excited rhythm in the buzzing. Now he remembered his\r\nshoulder-lamp, fumbled to switch it on, failed, and stumbled a few steps\r\nwith Nance toward the hill. Something caught his feet--then hers. Trying\r\nto get her free, he dropped his machete...\r\n\r\nHuth's voice spoke in his helmet-phone. \"We hear you, Nelsen! Hold\r\nout... We'll be there in forty minutes...\"\r\n\r\nYeah--forty minutes.\r\n\r\n\"It's--it's silly to be so scared, Frankie...\" he heard Nance stammer\r\nalmost apologetically. Dear Nance...\r\n\r\nScreaming, he kicked out again and again with his heavy boots, and got\r\nboth her and himself loose.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't any good. A shape loomed near them. A thing that must have\r\nsprung from _them_--someway. A huge, zombie form--the ugliest part of\r\nthis night of anguish and distortion. But he was sure that it was real.\r\n\r\nThe thing struck him in the stomach. Then there was a biting pain in his\r\nshoulder...\r\n\r\nThere wasn't any more, just then. But this wasn't quite the end, either.\r\nThe jangled impressions were like split threads of consciousness,\r\nmisery-wracked and tenuous. They were widely separated. His brain seemed\r\nto crack into a million needle-pointed shards, that made no sense except\r\nto indicate the passage of time. A month? A century...?\r\n\r\nIt seemed that he was always struggling impossibly to get himself and\r\nNance somewhere--out of hot, noisesome holes of suffocation, across\r\ndeserts, up endless walls, and past buzzing sounds that were mixed\r\nincongruously with strange harmonica music that seemed to express all\r\ntime and space... He could never succeed though the need was desperate.\r\nBut sometimes there was a coolness answering his thirst, or rubbed into\r\nhis burning skin, and he would seem to sleep... Often, voices told him\r\nthings, but he always forgot...\r\n\r\nIt wasn't true that he came out of the hot fog suddenly, but it seemed\r\nthat he did. He was sitting in dappled sunshine in an ordinary lawn\r\nchair of tubular magnesium with a back and bottom of gaudy fabric. Above\r\nhim was a narrow, sealed roof of stellene. The stone walls showed the\r\nbeady fossils of prehistoric Mars. More than probably, these chambers\r\nhad been cut in the living rock, by the ancients.\r\n\r\nReclining in another lawn chair beside his was Nance, her eyes closed,\r\nher face thin and pale. He was frightened--until he remembered,\r\nsomehow, that she was nearly as well as he was. Beyond her was a\r\ndoorway, leading into what seemed a small, modern kitchen. There was a\r\npassage to a small, neat garden, where Earthly vegetables and flowers\r\ngrew. It was ceiled with stellene; its walls were solid rock. Looking up\r\nthrough the transparent roof above him, he saw how a thin mesh of fuzzy\r\ntendrils and whorls masked this strange Shangri-la.\r\n\r\nNelsen closed his eyes, and thought back. Now he remembered most of what\r\nhe had been told. \"Mitch!\" he called quietly, so as not to awaken Nance.\r\n\"Hey, Mitch...! Selma...!\"\r\n\r\nMitch Storey was there in a moment--dressed in dungarees and work shirt\r\nlike he used to be, but taller, even leaner, and unsmiling.\r\n\r\nNelsen got up. \"Thanks, Mitch,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTheir voices stayed low and intense.\r\n\r\n\"For nothing, Frank. I'm damned glad to see you, but you still shouldn't\r\nhave come nosing. 'Cause--I told you why. Looking for you, Huth burned\r\nout more than five square miles. And if folks get too smart and too\r\ncurious, it won't be any good for what's here...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen felt angry and exasperated. But he had a haunting thought about a\r\nlanky colored kid in Jarviston, Minnesota. A guy with a dream--or\r\nperhaps a prescient glimpse of his own future.\r\n\r\n\"What's a pal supposed to do?\" he growled. \"For a helluva long time\r\nyou've answered nobody--though everyone in the Bunch must have tried\r\nbeaming you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Frank... Blame, from me, would be way out of line. I heard you\r\nguys lots of times. But it was best to get lost--maybe help keep the\r\nthickets like they are for as long as possible... A while back, I began\r\npicking up your voice in my phones again. I figured you were heading for\r\ntrouble when you kept coming with your girl to that same hill. So I was\r\naround, like I told you before... Sorry I had to hit you and give you\r\nthe needle, but you were nuts--gone with Syrtis. Getting you back here,\r\nwithout Huth spotting the old heli I picked up once at a deserted\r\nsettlers' camp was real tough going. I had to land, hide it and wait,\r\nfour or five times. And you were both plenty sick. But there are a few\r\nmedical gimmicks I learned from the thickets--better than those at the\r\nStation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done all right for yourself here, haven't you, Mitch?\" Nelsen\r\nremarked with a dash of mockery. \"All the modern conveniences--in the\r\nmiddle of the forbidden wilds of Syrtis Major.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Frank--'cause maybe I'm selfish. Though it's just stuff the\r\nsettlers left behind. Anyway, it wasn't so good at the start. I was\r\ncareful, but I got the fever, too. Light. Then I fell--broke my leg--out\r\nthere. I thought sure I was finished when they got hold of me. But I\r\njust lay there, playing on my mouth organ--an old hymn--inside my\r\nhelmet. Maybe it was the music--they must have felt the radio impulses\r\nof my tooting before. Or else they knew, somehow, that I was on their\r\nside--that I figured they were too important just to disappear and that\r\nI meant to do anything I could, short of killing, to keep them all\r\nright... Nope, I wouldn't say that they were so friendly, but they might\r\nhave thought I'd be useful--a guinea-pig to study and otherwise. For all\r\nI know, examining my body may have helped them improve their weapons...\r\nAnyhow--you won't believe this--'cause it's sort of fantastic--but you\r\nknow they work best with living tissue. They fixed that leg, bound it\r\ntight with tendrils, went through the steel cloth of my Archer with\r\nhollow thorns. The bone knit almost completely in four days. And the\r\nfever broke. Then they let me go. Selma was already out looking for me.\r\nWhen I found her, she had the fever, too. But I guess we're immune now.\"\r\n\r\nStorey's quiet voice died away.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do, Mitch? Just stay here for good?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else--if I can? This is better than anything I remember. Peaceful,\r\ntoo. If they study me, I study them--not like a real scientist--but by\r\njust having them close around. I even got to know some of their buzzing\r\ntalk. Maybe I'll have to be their ambassador to human folks, sometime.\r\nThey _are_ from the planets of the stars, Frank. Sirius, I think. Tough\r\nlittle spores can be ejected from one atmosphere, and drift in space for\r\nmillions of years... They arrived after the first Martians were extinct.\r\nNow that you're here, Frank, I wish you'd stay. But that's no good.\r\nSomebody lost always makes people poke around.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen might have argued a few points. But for one thing, he felt too\r\ntired. \"I'll buy it all, your way, Mitch,\" he said. \"I hope Nance and I\r\ncan get out of here in a couple more days. Maybe I shouldn't have run\r\nout on the Belt. Can't run--thoughts follow you. But now--dammit--I want\r\nto go home!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's regular, Frank. 'Cause you've got Syrtis. Chronic,\r\nnow--intermittent. But it'll fade. Same with your girl. Meanwhile, they\r\nwon't let you go Earthside, but you'll be okay. I'll fly you out, close\r\nenough to the Station to get back, any morning before daylight, that you\r\npick... Only, you won't tell, will you, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I promise--if you think secrecy makes any difference.\r\nOtherwise--thanks for everything... By the way--do you ever listen in\r\non outside news?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough. Still quiet... And a fella named Miguel Ramos--with\r\nnerve-controlled clamps for hands--got a new, special bubb and took off\r\nfor Pluto.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Damn fool... Almost as loony as you are, Mitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Less... Wake up, Nance. Dinner... Chicken--raised right here...\"\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, Frank Nelsen and Nance Codiss sat in the garden.\r\n\"If I blur, just hold me tight, Frankie,\" she said. \"Everything is still\r\ntoo strange to quite get a grip on--yet... But I'm _not_ going home,\r\nFrank--not even when it is allowed. I set out--I'm sticking--I'm not\r\nturning tail. It's what people have got to do--in space more than\r\never...\"\r\n\r\nEven when the seizure of fever came, and the sweat gathered on her lips,\r\nand her eyes went wild, she gritted her teeth and just clung to him. She\r\nhad spunk--admirable, if perhaps destructive. \"Love yuh,\" Frank kept\r\nsaying. \"Love yuh, Sweetie...\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later, before the frigid dawn, they saw the last of Mitch\r\nStorey and his slender, beautiful wife with her challenging brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful that you do right for Mitch and--these _folks_,\" she warned\r\nalmost commandingly as the old heli landed in the desert a few miles\r\nfrom the Station. \"What would you do--if outsiders came blundering into\r\nyour world by the hundreds, making trails, killing you with fire? At\r\nfirst, _they_ didn't even fight back.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was ancient but valid. In spite of his experiences, Nelsen\r\nagreed with the logic and the justice. \"We'll make up a story, Selma,\"\r\nhe said solemnly.\r\n\r\nMitch looked anxious. \"Human people will find a way, won't they, Frank?\"\r\nhe asked. \"To win, to come to Mars and live, I mean--to change\r\neverything. Sure--some will be sympathetic. But when there's practical\r\npressure--need--danger--economics...?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Mitch,\" Nelsen answered in the same tone as before. \"Your\r\nthickets do have a pretty good defense.\"\r\n\r\nBut in his heart he suspected that fierce human persistence couldn't be\r\nstopped--_as long as there were humans left_. Mitch and his star folk\r\ncouldn't withdraw from the mainstream of competition--inherent in\r\nlife--that was spreading again across the solar system. They could only\r\nstand their ground, take their fearful chances, be part of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the last things Mitch said, was, \"Got any cigarettes, Frank?\r\nSelma likes one, once in a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Three packs here inside my Archer. Mighty small hospitality gift,\r\nMitch...\"\r\n\r\nAfter the 'copter drifted away, it seemed that a curtain drew over\r\nNelsen's mind, blurring the whole memory. It was as though _they_ had\r\nplanned that. It was almost as though Mitch, and Selma, as he had just\r\nseen them, were just another mind-fantasy of the Heebie-Jeebie Planet,\r\ncreated by its present masters.\r\n\r\n\"Should we believe it?\" Nance whispered.\r\n\r\n\"My cigarettes are gone,\" Frank told her.\r\n\r\nAt the Survey Station they got weary looks from Ed Huth. \"I guess I\r\npicked a wrong man, Nelsen,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as though you did, Ed,\" Frank replied. \"I'm really sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThey got worse hell from a little doctor from Italy, whose name was\r\nPadetti. They were asked a lot of questions. They fibbed some, but not\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\"We sort of blanked out, Doctor,\" Nance told him. \"I suppose we spent\r\nmost of our time in the desert, living in our Archers. There were the\r\nusual distorted hallucinations of Syrtis Fever. A new strain, I\r\nsuspect... Four months gone? Oh, no...!\"\r\n\r\nShe must have had a time evading his questions for the next month, while\r\nshe worked, again, in the lab. Maybe he did divine half of the truth, at\r\nlast. Maybe he even was sympathetic toward the thickets that he was\r\ntrying to defeat.\r\n\r\nNelsen wasn't allowed to touch another helicopter. During that month,\r\nbetween brief but violent seizures of the fever, he was employed as a\r\nmaintenance mechanic.\r\n\r\nThen the news came. There had been an emergency call from Pallastown.\r\nRescue units were to be organized, and rocketed out in high-velocity\r\nU.N.S.F. and U.S.S.F bubbs. There had been sabotage, violence. The Town\r\nwas three-quarters gone, above the surface. Planned attack or--almost\r\nworse--merely the senseless result of space-poisoned men kicking off the\r\nlid in a spree of hell-raising humor and fun?\r\n\r\nNelsen was bitter. But he also felt the primitive excitement--almost an\r\neagerness. That was the savage paradox in life.\r\n\r\n\"You still have the dregs of Syrtis Fever,\" a recruiting physician told\r\nhim. \"But you know the Belt. That makes a big difference... All\r\nright--you're going...\"\r\n\r\nNance Codiss didn't have that experience. Her lab background wasn't\r\nenough. So she was stuck, on Mars.\r\n\r\nNelsen had been pestering her to marry him. Now, in a corner of the\r\ncrowded lounge, he tried again.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"You'd still have to leave me, Frank,\" she told him.\r\n\"Because that's the way strong people _have_ to be--when there's\r\ntrouble to be met. Let's wait. Let's know a little better where we're\r\nat--please, darling. I'll be all right. Contact me when you can...\"\r\n\r\nHer tone was low and tender and unsteady. He hugged her close.\r\n\r\nSoon, he was aboard a GO-rocket, shooting up to Phobos to join the\r\nassembling rescue team. He wondered if this was the beginning of the\r\nend...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen missed the first shambles at Pallastown, of course, since\r\neven at high speed, the rescue unit with which he came did not arrive\r\nuntil days after the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThere had been hardly any warning, since the first attack had sprung\r\nfrom the sub-levels of the city itself.\r\n\r\nA huge tank of liquid oxygen, and another tank of inflammable synthetic\r\nhydrocarbons to be used in the manufacture of plastics, had been\r\nsimultaneously ruptured by charges of explosive, together with the\r\nheavy, safety partition between them. The resulting blast and fountain\r\nof fire had jolted even the millions of tons of Pallas' mass several\r\nmiles from its usual orbit.\r\n\r\nThe sack of the town had begun at once, from within, even before chunks\r\nof asteroid material, man-accelerated and--aimed, had begun to splatter\r\nblossoms of incandescence into the confusion of deflating domes and\r\ndying inhabitants. Other vandal bands had soon landed from space.\r\n\r\nThe first hours of trying to regain any sort of order, during the\r\nassault and after it was finally beaten off, must have been heroic\r\neffort almost beyond conception. Local disaster units, helped by hoppers\r\nand citizens, had done their best. Then many had turned to pursuit and\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nAfter Nelsen's arrival, his memory of the interval of acute emergency\r\ncould have been broken down into a series of pictures, in which he was\r\noften active.\r\n\r\nFirst, the wreckage, which he helped to pick up, like any of the others.\r\nPallastown had been like froth on a stone, a castle on a floating,\r\ngolden crag. It had been a flimsy, hastily-built mushroom city, with a\r\nbeautiful, tawdry splendor that had seemed out of place, a target\r\nshining for thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nHaw, haw...! Nelsen could almost hear the coarse laughter of the Jolly\r\nLads, as they broke it up, robbed it, raped it--because they both\r\nsneered at its effeteness, and missed what it represented to them...\r\nNelsen remembered very well how a man's attitudes could be warped while\r\nhe struggled for mere survival in an Archer drifting in space.\r\n\r\nYet even as he worked with the others, to put up temporary domes and to\r\ngather the bloated dead, the hatred arose in him, and was strengthened\r\nby the fury and grief in the grim, strong faces around him. To exist\r\nwhere it was, Pallastown could not be as soft as it seemed. And to the\r\nhoppers--the rugged, level-headed ones who deserved the name--it had\r\nmeant much, though they had visited it for only a few days of fun, now\r\nand then.\r\n\r\nThe Jolly Lads had been routed. Some must have fled chuckling and\r\ncursing almost sheepishly, like infants the magnitude of whose mischief\r\nhas surpassed their intention, and has awed and frightened them, at\r\nlast. They had been followed, even before the various late-coming space\r\nforces could get into action.\r\n\r\nNelsen overheard words that helped complete the pictures:\r\n\r\n\"I'll get them... They had my wife...\"\r\n\r\n\"This was planned--you know where...\"\r\n\r\nIt was planned, all right. But if Ceres, the Tovie colony, had actually\r\nbeen the instigator, there was evidence that the scheme had gotten out\r\nof hand. The excitement of destruction had spread. Stories came back\r\nthat Ceres had been attacked, too.\r\n\r\n\"I killed a man, Frank--with this pre-Asteroidal knife. He was after\r\nHelen and my son...\"\r\n\r\nThis was timid David Lester talking, awed at himself, proud, but\r\ncuriously ashamed. This made another picture. By luck the Lesters lived\r\nin the small above-the-surface portion of Pallastown that had not been\r\nseriously damaged.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen also killed, during a trip to Post One of the KRNH\r\nEnterprises, to get more stellene and other materials to expand the\r\ntemporary encampments for the survivors. He killed two fleeing men\r\ncoldly and at a distance, because they did not answer his hail. The\r\nshreds of their bodies and the loot they had been carrying were\r\nscattered to drift in the vacuum, adding another picture of retribution\r\nto thousands like it.\r\n\r\nBelt Parnay was the name of the leader whom everybody really wanted to\r\nget. Belt Parnay--another Fessler, another Fanshaw. That was a curious\r\nthing. There was another name and face; but as far as could be told, the\r\npersonality was very similar. It was as if, out of the darker side of\r\nhuman nature, a kind of reincarnation would always take place.\r\n\r\nThey didn't get Parnay. Inevitably, considering the enormity of space,\r\nmany of the despoilers of Pallastown escaped. The shrewdest, the most\r\nexperienced, the most willing to shout and lead and let others do the\r\ndangerous work, had the advantage. For they also knew how to run and\r\nhide and be prudently quiet. Parnay was one of these.\r\n\r\nSome captives were recovered. Others were found, murdered. Fortunately,\r\nPallastown was still largely a man's city. But pursuit and revenge still\r\nwent on...\r\n\r\nPost One was intact. Art Kuzak had surrounded it with a cordon of tough\r\nand angry asteroid-hoppers. It was the same with the other posts, except\r\nFive and Nine, which were wiped out.\r\n\r\n\"Back at last, eh, Nelsen?\" Art roared angrily, as soon as Frank had\r\nentered his office.\r\n\r\n\"A fact we should accept, not discuss,\" Nelsen responded dryly. \"You\r\nknow the things we need.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um-hmm--Nelsen. To rescue and restore Pallastown--when it's pure\r\nnonsense, only inviting another assault! When we know that dispersal is\r\nthe only answer. The way things are, everywhere, the whole damned human\r\nrace needs to be dispersed--if some of it is to survive!\"\r\n\r\nIt made another picture--Art Kuzak, the old friend, gone somewhat too\r\nbig for his oversized britches, perhaps... No doubt Art had had to put\r\naside some grandiose visions, considering the turn that events had\r\ntaken: Whole asteroids moved across the distance, and put into orbit\r\naround the Earth, so that their mineral wealth could be extracted more\r\nconveniently. Space resorts established for tourists; new sports made\r\npossible by zero-gravity, invented and advertised. Art Kuzak had the\r\ngift of both big dreaming and of practice. He'd talked of such things,\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nNelsen's smirk was wry. \"Dispersal for survival. I agree,\" he said.\r\n\"When they tried to settle Mars, it was being mentioned. Also, long\r\nbefore that. Your wisdom is not new, Art. It wasn't followed perhaps\r\nbecause people are herding animals by instinct. Anyhow, our side has to\r\nhold what it has _really_ got--one-fourth of Pallastown above the\r\nsurface, and considerably more underground, including shops,\r\ninstallations, and seventy per cent of its skilled inhabitants,\r\ndetermined to stay in the Belt after the others were killed or wounded,\r\nor ran away. Unless you've quit claiming to be a practical man, Art,\r\nyou'll have to go along with helping them. You know what kind of\r\nmaterials and equipment are needed, and how much we can supply, better\r\nthan I do. Or do I have to withdraw my fraction of the company in\r\ngoods? We'll take up the dispersal problem as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak could only sigh heavily, grin a lopsided grin, and produce.\r\nSoon a great caravan of stuff was on the move.\r\n\r\nThere was another picture: Eileen Sands, the old Queen of Serene in a\r\nnot-yet-forgotten song, sitting on a lump of yellow alloy splashed up\r\nfrom the surface of Pallas, where a chunk of mixed metal and stone had\r\nstruck at a speed of several miles per second, fusing the native alloy\r\nand destroying her splendid _Second Stop_ utterly in a flash of\r\nincandescence. Back in Archer, she looked almost as she used to look at\r\nHendricks'. Her smile was rueful.\r\n\r\n\"Shucks, I'm all right, Frank,\" she said. \"Even if Insurance, with so\r\nmany disaster-claims, can't pay me--which they probably still can. The\r\nboys'll keep needing entertainment, if it's only in a stellene space\r\ntent. They won't let me just sit... For two bits, though, I'd move into\r\na nice, safe orbit, out of the Belt and on the other side of the sun\r\nfrom the Earth, and build myself a retreat and retire. I'd become a\r\nspacewoman, like I wanted to, in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Nelsen joshed. \"Otherwise, what have you heard and seen?\r\nThere's a certain fella...\"\r\n\r\nRight away, she thought he meant Ramos. \"The damfool--why ask me,\r\nFrank?\" she sniffed, her expression sour and sad. \"How long has he been\r\ngone again, now? As usual he was proposing--for the first few days after\r\nhe set out. After that, there were a few chirps of messages. Then\r\npractically nothing. Anyway, how long does it take to get way out to\r\nPluto and back, even if a whole man can have the luck to make it. And is\r\nthere much more than half of him left...? For two bits I'd--ah--skip\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nNelsen smiled with half of his mouth. \"I wanted to know about Ramos,\r\ntoo, Eileen. Thanks. But I was talking about Tiflin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Umhmm--you're right. He and Pal Igor were both around at my place about\r\nan hour before we were hit. I called him something worse than a bad\r\nomen. He was edgy--almost like he used to be. He said that, one of these\r\ndays--be cavalier--I was going to get mine. He and Igor eeled away\r\nbefore my customers could break their necks.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen showed his teeth. \"Thanks again. I wondered,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe stayed in Pallastown until, however patched it looked, it was\r\nfunctioning as the center of the free if rough-and-tumble part of the\r\nBelt once more--though he didn't know for how long this would be true.\r\nOrder of one kind had been fairly restored. But out of the disaster, and\r\nsomething very similar on Ceres, the thing that had always been most\r\nfeared had sprung. It was the fact of opposed organized might in close\r\nproximity in the region between Pallas and Ceres. Again there was\r\nblaming and counter-blaming, about incidents the exact sources of which\r\nnever became clear. What each of the space forces, patrolling opposite\r\neach other, had in the way of weapons, was of course no public matter,\r\neither; but how do you rate two inconceivables? Nor did the threat stay\r\nout in the vastness between the planets.\r\n\r\nFrom Earth came the news of a gigantic, incandescent bubble, rising from\r\nthe floor of the Pacific Ocean, and spreading in almost\r\nradioactivity-free waves and ripples, disrupting penned-in areas of\r\nfood-producing sea, and lapping at last at far shores. Both sides\r\ndisclaimed responsibility for the blast.\r\n\r\nEverybody insisted hopefully that this latest danger would die down,\r\ntoo. Statesmen would talk, official tempers would be calmed, some new\r\nworking arrangements would be made. But meanwhile, the old Sword of\r\nDamocles hung by a thinner hair than ever before. One trigger-happy\r\nindividual might snap it for good. If not now, the next time, or the\r\nnext. A matter of hours, days, or years. The mathematics of\r\nprobabilities denied that luck could last forever. In this thought there\r\nwas a sense of helplessness, and the ghost of a second Asteroid Belt.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen might have continued to make himself useful in Pallastown,\r\nor he might have rejoined the Kuzaks, who had moved their mobile posts\r\nback into a safer zone on the other side of Pallas. But his instincts,\r\nnow, all pointed along another course of action--the only course that\r\nseemed to make any sense just then.\r\n\r\nHe approached Art Kuzak at Post One. \"About deployment,\" he began. \"I've\r\nmade up some sketches, showing what I'd like the factories to turn out.\r\nThe ideas aren't new--now they'll spring up all around like thoughts of\r\nfood in a famine. If anything will approach answering all problems, they\r\nwill. And KRNH is as well able to put them into effect as anybody...\r\nSo--unless you've got some better suggestions?\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak looked the sketches over shrewdly for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Frank,\" he said after some further conversation. \"It looks\r\ngood enough. I'll chip in. Whether they're sucker bait or not, these\r\nthings will sell. Only--could it be you're running away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Nelsen answered. \"Or following my nose--by a kind of natural\r\ncompulsion which others will display, too. Two hundred of these to\r\nstart. The men going with me will pay for theirs. I'll cover the rest of\r\nthis batch: You'll be better than I am at figuring out prices and terms\r\nfor later batches. Just on a hunch, I'll always want a considerable\r\noversupply. Post One's shops can turn them out fast. All they are,\r\nmostly, is just stellene, arranged in a somewhat new way. The\r\nfittings--whatever can't be supplied now, can follow.\"\r\n\r\nFifty asteroid-hoppers, ten of them accompanied by wives, went with\r\nNelsen as he started out with a loaded caravan toward an empty region\r\nhalfway between the orbits of Earth and Mars. Everyone in the group was\r\nconvinced by yearnings of his own.\r\n\r\nThinking of Nance Codiss, Nelsen planned to keep within beam range of\r\nthe Red Planet. He had called Nance quite often. She was still working\r\nin the Survey Station hospital, which was swamped with injured from\r\nPallastown.\r\n\r\nNelsen could tag all of the fierce drives in him with single words.\r\n\r\nHome was the first. After all his years away from Earth, the meaning of\r\nthe word would have been emphatic in him, even without the recurrent\r\nspasms of hot-cold weakness, which, though fading, still legally denied\r\nhim the relief of going back to old familiar things. Besides, Earth\r\nseemed insecure. So he could only try to make home possible in space.\r\nRemembering his first trip, long ago, from the Moon to Mars, he knew how\r\ngentle the Big Vacuum could sometimes seem, with just a skin of stellene\r\nbetween it and himself. Home was a plain longing, too, in the hard,\r\nlevel eyes around him.\r\n\r\nLove. Well, wasn't that part of the first item he had tagged?\r\n\r\nWanderlust. The adventurous distance drive--part of any wild-blooded\r\nvagabond male. Here in his idea, this other side of a human paradox\r\nseemed possible to answer, too. You could go anywhere. Home went with\r\nyou. Your friends could go along, if they wished.\r\n\r\nFreedom. In the billions of cubic miles could any system ever be big\r\nenough to pen you in, tell you what to think or do, as long as you hurt\r\nno one? Well--he thought not, but perhaps that remained to be seen.\r\n\r\nSafety. Deployment was supposed to be the significant factor, there. And\r\nhow could you make it any better than it was going to be now? Even if\r\nthere were new dangers?\r\n\r\nThe future. There was no staying with the past. The Earth was becoming\r\ntoo small for its expanding population. It was a stifling, dangerous\r\nlittle world that, if the pressures were not relieved, might puff into\r\nfire and fragments at any moment during any year. And the era of\r\nprospecting and exploration in the Asteroid Belt seemed destined soon to\r\ncome to an end, in any event.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen's drives were very strong, after so much had passed around\r\nhim for so long a time. Thus, maybe he became too idealistic and--at\r\nmoments--almost fanatically believing, without enough of the saving\r\ngrain of doubt and humor. The hoppers with him were much like\r\nhimself--singly directed by what they had lacked for years.\r\n\r\nThe assembly operation was quickly accomplished, as soon as they were\r\nwhat they considered a safe distance from the Belt. On a greater scale,\r\nit was almost nothing more than the first task that Nelsen had ever\r\nperformed in space--the jockying of a bubb from its blastoff drum,\r\ninflating it, rigging it, spinning it for centrifugal gravity, and\r\nfitting in its internal appointments.\r\n\r\nNelsen looked at the fifty-odd stellene rings that they had broken out\r\nof their containers--the others, still packed, were held in reserve.\r\nThose that had been freed glistened translucently in the sunlight.\r\nNelsen had always thought that bubbs were beautiful. And these were\r\nstill bubbs, but they were bigger, safer, more complicated.\r\n\r\nA bantam-sized hopper named Hank Janns spoke from beside Nelsen as they\r\nfloated near each other. \"Pop--sizzle--and it's yours, Chief. A prefab,\r\na house, a dwelling. A kitchen, a terrace, a place for a garden, a place\r\nfor kids, even... With a few personal touches, you've got it made.\r\nBetter than the house trailer my dad used to hook onto the jalopy when I\r\nwas ten... My Alice likes it, too, Chief--that's the _real_ signal! Tell\r\nyour pals Kuzak that this is the Idea of the Century.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen kind of thought so, too, just then. The first thing he did\r\nwas to beam the Survey Station on Mars, like he was doing twice a\r\nweek--to communicate more often would have courted the still dangerous\r\nchance of being pinpointed. For similar reasons he couldn't explain too\r\nclearly what his project was, but he hoped that he had gotten a picture\r\nof what it was like across to his girl.\r\n\r\n\"Come see for yourself, Nance,\" he said enthusiastically. \"I'll arrange\r\nfor a caravan from Post One to stop by on Phobos and pick you up.\r\nAlso--there's my old question... So, what'll it be, Nance? Maybe we can\r\nfeel a little surer of ourselves, now. We can work the rest out. Come\r\nand look, hang around--see how everything shakes down, if you'd rather.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited for the light-minutes to pass, before he could hear her voice.\r\n\"Hello, Frank...\" There was the same eager quaver. \"Still pretty jammed,\r\nFrank... But we know about it here--from Art... Some of the Pallastown\r\nconvalescents will be migrating your way... I'll wrangle free and come\r\nalong... Maybe in about a month...\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't know quite whether to take her at her word--or whether she was\r\nsomehow hedging. In the Big Vacuum, the human mind seemed hard put,\r\nquite, to know itself. Distances and separations were too great.\r\nEmotions were too intense or too stunned. This much he had learned to\r\nunderstand. Perhaps he had lost Nance. But maybe, still--in some bleak,\r\nfatalistic way--it would be just as well in the end, for them both.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Nance,\" he said gently. \"I'll call again--the regular time...\"\r\n\r\nRight after that he was talking, over a much greater span, to Art Kuzak.\r\n\"First phase about completed, Art... Finger to thumb--in spite of the\r\ntroubles elsewhere. So let it roll...!\"\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak's reply had an undercurrent of jubilance, as if whatever he\r\nknew now was better than he had expected. \"Second phase is en route. Joe\r\nwill be along... Don't be surprised...\"\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak's approach, a few hundred hours later, made a luminous cluster\r\nin the sky, like a miniature galaxy. It resolved itself into vast bales,\r\nand all of the stellene rings--storage and factory--of Post Three. Also\r\nthere were over a hundred men and thirty-three wives. Many of them were\r\nPallastown refugees.\r\n\r\nNelsen helped Joe through the airlock of the ring that he had hoped\r\nwould be his and Nance's. \"Bubbtown, huh, Frank?\" Joe chuckled. \"The\r\nidea is spreading faster than we had believed, and we aren't the only\r\nones that have got it. The timing is just right. People are scared, fed\r\nup. Out Here--and on Earth, too... Most of the guys that are single in\r\nthis crowd have girls who will be on the way soon. Some of the tougher\r\nspace-fitness tests are being junked. We're even screening a small batch\r\nof runaways from Ceres--to be included in the next load. An experiment.\r\nBut it should work out. They're just like anybody... Art is all of\r\nsudden sort of liberal--the way he gets when things seem to break\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nEverything went fine for quite a while. Art Kuzak was out playing his\r\nhunches, giving easy terms to those who couldn't pay at once.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well gamble,\" he growled from the distance. \"Space and\r\nterrestrial forces are still poised. If we lose at all, we lose the\r\nwhole works, anyway. So let's bring them from all around the Belt, from\r\nEarth, Venus and from wherever they'll come. Give them a place to work,\r\nor let them start their own deal. It all helps... You know what I hear?\r\nThe Tovies are letting men do things by themselves. To hold their own in\r\nroom as big as this, they have to. Their bosses are over a barrel. Just\r\norganized discipline ain't gonna work. A guy has to want things his own\r\nway...\"\r\n\r\nIn a more general view, doubts were sneaking up on Frank Nelsen, though\r\nas far as KRNH was concerned, he had started the ball rolling. \"We'll\r\nkeep our fingers crossed,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was only a couple of Earth-days later that another member of the old\r\nBunch showed up. \"I had to bubb all the way from Mercury to Post One to\r\nget your location from Art, Frankie,\" he complained. \"Cripes--why didn't\r\nanybody ever try to beam Gimp and me, anymore? Solar radiation ain't\r\n_that_ hard to get past... So I had to come sneak a look for myself, to\r\nsee what the Big Deal on the grapevine is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We left the back door unlatched for you, Two-and-Two,\" Nelsen laughed.\r\n\"And you crept in quietly. Swell to see you.\"\r\n\r\nSitting showered and in fresh clothes on Frank Nelsen's sundeck, any\r\nchanges in Two-and-Two Baines were less evident than one might have\r\nsupposed. His eyes had a much surer, farther look. Otherwise he was\r\nstill the same large hulk with much the same lugubrious humor.\r\n\r\n\"Mercury's okay, Frankie,\" he said. \"About four thousand people are\r\nliving in the Twilight Zone, already. I could show you pictures, but I\r\nguess you know. Whole farms and little towns under stellene. Made me\r\nsome dough doing lots of the building. Could have been more, but who\r\ncares? Oh, Gimp'll be along out here sometime, soon. He was putting up\r\nanother solar powerhouse. But he's beginning to say, what the hell, the\r\nfuture ain't there, or on any planet... So this is how it's gonna be,\r\nhuh? With some additions, sure. Factories, super markets, cornfields,\r\npig farms, parks, playgrounds, beauty parlors, all encased in stellene,\r\nand orbiting in clusters around the sun, eh...? 'Hey, Pop!' some small\r\nfry will say to his old man. 'Gimme ten bucks, please, for an ice cream\r\ncone down at the soda bubb?' And his mom'll say to his dad, 'George,\r\nDear--is the ionocar nice and shiny? I have to go play bridge with the\r\ngirls over in Nelsenville...' No, I'm not ribbing you, Frankie. It'll be\r\nkind of nice to hear that type of talk, again--if they only include a\r\nplace for a man to be a little bit himself.\"\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two (George) Baines sighed rapturously and continued. \"Figure it\r\nout to the end, Frankie. No planets left--all the materials in them used\r\nup to build these bubbtowns. There'll be just big shining, magnificent\r\nrings made up of countless little floating stellene houses all around\r\nthe sun. A zillion people, maybe more. Gardens, flowers, everything\r\nbeautiful. Everybody free to move anywhere. Uh-uh--I'm not making fun,\r\nFrankie. I'm joining in with all the relief and happiness of my heart.\r\nOnly, it'll be kind of sad to see the old planets go--to be replaced by\r\na wonderful super-suburbia. Or maybe we should say, superbia.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen burst out laughing, at last. \"You sly slob...! Anyhow, _that_\r\nextreme is millenniums off--if it has a chance of happening, at all.\r\nEven so, our descendants, if any, will be going to the stars by then.\r\nThere won't be any frustration of their thirst for danger... Just as\r\nthere isn't any, now, for us. Except that we can keep our weapons handy,\r\nand hope... Me--I'm a bit bored with adventure, just at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" Two-and-Two affirmed fervently. \"Now, have you got me a job,\r\nFrankie?\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be something,\" Nelsen answered him. \"Meanwhile, to keep from\r\nfeeling regimented by civilization, you could take your rocket launcher\r\nand join the perimeter watchers that range out a thousand miles...\"\r\n\r\nNance Codiss arrived a week later, with a group of recent Pallastown\r\nconvalescents. Bad signs came with her, but that fact got lost as she\r\nhugged Nelsen quickly there in the dwelling he had set up with the\r\nthought it would be their home. At once she went on a feminine exploring\r\nexpedition of the prefab's interior, and its new, gleaming appointments.\r\nKitchen, living room, sundeck. Nelsen's garden was already well along.\r\n\r\n\"Like the place?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Love it, Frank,\" she answered quietly.\r\n\r\n\"It could have been more individual,\" he commented. \"But we were in a\r\nhurry. So they are all identical. That can be fixed, some, soon. You're\r\nthinking about improvements?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes twinkled past the shadow in her expression. \"Always some,\" she\r\nlaughed. Then her face went solemn. \"Let them ride, for now, Frank. It's\r\nall wonderful and unbelievable. Hug me again--I love you. Only--all this\r\nis even more fantastically new to me than it is to you. Realize that,\r\nplease, Frank. I'm a month late in getting here and I'm still groping my\r\nway. A little more time--for us both... Because you might be fumbling,\r\nsome, too.\"\r\n\r\nHer tone was gentle. He saw that her eyes, meeting his, were honest and\r\nclear. He felt the careful strength behind them, after a moment of hurt.\r\nThere was no rushing, one-way enthusiasm that might easily burn out and\r\nblow up in a short time.\r\n\r\nHe held her close. \"Sure, Nance,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You probably know that our group from Mars was followed, Frank. I hope\r\nI'm not a jinx.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you're not. Somebody would have followed--sometime. We're\r\nwatching and listening. Just keep your Archer handy...\"\r\n\r\nThe faint, shifting blips in the radar screens was an old story,\r\nreminding him that certain things were no better than before, and that\r\nsome were worse. Somewhere there were other bubbtowns. There were\r\npolicing space forces, too. But for millions of miles around, this\r\ncluster of eight hundred prefabs and the numerous larger bubbs that\r\nserved them, were all alone.\r\n\r\nNelsen looked out from his sundeck, and saw dangerous contrasts. The\r\nworst, perhaps, was a spherical bubble of stellene. Inside it was a\r\ngreat globe of water surrounded by air--a colossal dewdrop. Within it, a\r\nman and two small boys--no doubt father and sons from Pallastown, were\r\nswimming, horsing around, having a swell time--only a few feet from\r\nnothing. Nelsen spoke softly into his radio-phone. \"Leland--close down\r\nthe pool...\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before the perimeter watch, returning from a patrol that\r\nhad taken them some distance out, brought in a makeshift dwelling bubb\r\nmade from odds and ends of stellene. They had also picked up its\r\noccupant, a lean comic character with an accent and a strange way of\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\n\"Funny that you'd turn up, here--Igor, is it?\" Nelsen said dryly.\r\n\r\nIgor sniffed, as if with sorrow. He had been roughed up, some. \"Very\r\nfunny--also simple. You making a house, so I am making a house for this\r\nidentical purpose. People from Ceres are already being here; in\r\nconsequence, I am also arriving. Nobody are saying what are proper doing\r\nand thinking--so I am informed. I am believing--okay, Igor. When being\r\nnot true, I am going away again.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone was bland. The pale eyes looked naive and artless, except,\r\nperhaps, for a hard, shrewd glint, deep down.\r\n\r\nJoe Kuzak was present. \"We searched him, Frank,\" he said. \"His bubb,\r\ntoo. He's clean--as far as we can tell. Not even a weapon. I also asked\r\nhim some questions. I savvy a little of his real lingo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask them over,\" Nelsen answered. \"Igor--a friend named Tiflin\r\nwouldn't be being around some place, would he?\"\r\n\r\nThe large space comedian didn't even hesitate. \"I am thinking not very\r\nfar--not knowing precisely. Somebody more is being here, likewise. Belt\r\nParnay. You are knowing this one? Plenty Jollies--new fellas--not having\r\nmuch supplies--only many new rocket launchers they are receiving from\r\nsomeplace. You are understanding this? Bad luck, here, it is meaning.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen eyed the man warily, with mixed doubt and liking. \"I don't think\r\nyou can be going away again, right now, Igor,\" he said. \"We don't have a\r\njail, but a guard will be as good...\"\r\n\r\nThe watch didn't give the alarm for several hours. Three hisses in the\r\nphones, made vocally. Then one, then two more. North, second quadrant,\r\nthat meant. Direction of first attack. Ionic drives functioned. The\r\ncluster of bubbs began to scatter further. Nelsen knew that if Igor had\r\ntold the truth, the outlook was very poor. Too much deployment would\r\nthin the defenses too much. And against new, homing rockets--if Parnay\r\nreally had them--it would be almost useless. A relatively small number\r\nof men, riding free in armor, could smash the much larger targets from\r\nalmost any distance.\r\n\r\nNelsen didn't stay in his prefab. Floating in his Archer, he could be\r\nhis own, less easily identifiable, less easily hit command post, while\r\nhe fired his own homing missiles at the far-off radar specks of the\r\nattackers. He ordered everyone not specifically needed inside the bubbs\r\nfor some defense purpose to jump clear.\r\n\r\nIn the first half-minute, he saw at least fifty compartmented prefabs\r\npartly crumple, as explosives tore into them. A dozen, torn open, were\r\ndeflated entirely. The swimming pool globe was punctured, and a cloud of\r\nfrosty vapor made rainbows in the sunshine, as the water boiled away.\r\nFar out, Nelsen saw the rockets he and his own men had launched,\r\nsparkling soundlessly, no doubt scoring, some, too.\r\n\r\nThe attackers didn't even try to get close yet. Far greater damage would\r\nhave to be inflicted, before panic and disorganization might give them\r\nsufficient advantage. But such damage would take only minutes. Too much\r\nwould reduce the loot. So now there was a halt in the firing, and\r\nanother component of fear was applied. It was a growling, taunting\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Nelsen! And all of you silly bladder-brains...! This is Belt Parnay...!\r\nEver hear of him? Come back from hell, eh? Not with just rocks, this\r\ntime! The latest, surest equipment! Want to give up, now, Nelsen--you\r\nand your nice, civilized people? Cripes, what will you cranks try next?\r\nVillages built in nothing and on nothing! Thanks, though. Brother, what\r\na blowout this is gonna provide!\"\r\n\r\nParnay's tone had shifted, becoming mincingly mocking, then hard and\r\njoyful at the end.\r\n\r\nMaybe he shouldn't have suggested so plainly what would happen--unless\r\nsomething was done, soon. Maybe he shouldn't have sounded just a little\r\nbit unsure of himself under all his bluff. Because Nelsen had made\r\npreparations that matched a general human trend. Now, he saw a condition\r\nthat fitted in, making an opportunity... So he began to taunt Parnay\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"We've got a lot of the latest type rockets to throw, too, Parnay. You'd\r\nhave quite a time, trying to take us. But there's more... Just look\r\nbehind you, Parnay. And all around. Not too far. Who's silly? Who's the\r\njerk? Some new guys are in your crowd, I hear? Then they won't have much\r\nagainst them--they aren't real outlaws. Do you think they want to keep\r\nfollowing you around, stinking in their armor--when what we've got is\r\nwhat they're bound to want, right now, too? They can hear what I'm\r\nsaying, Parnay. Every one of them must have a weapon in his hands. Why,\r\nyou stupid clown, you're in a trap! We will give them what they need\r\nmost, without them having to risk getting killed. In space, there'll\r\nhave to be a lot of things forgotten, but not for you or for the rough\r\nold-timers with you... Come on, you guys out there. There's a folded\r\nbubb right here waiting for each of you. Take it anywhere you want--away\r\nfrom here, of course... Parnay--big, important Belt Parnay--are you\r\nstill alive...?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen had his own sneering tone of mockery. He used it to best\r\nadvantage--but with fear in his heart. Plenty of his act was only\r\ncounter-bluff. But now, as he paused, he heard Two-and-Two Baines'\r\nmournful voice continue the barrage of persuasion.\r\n\r\n\"Flowers, Parnay? We ain't got many, yet. But you won't care...\r\nFellas--do you want to keep being pushed around by this loud mouth who\r\nlikes to run and lets you sweat for him, because he's mostly alone and\r\nneeds company? Believe me, I know what it's like out there, too. At a\r\ncertain point, all you really want is something a little like home. And\r\nthe Chief ain't kidding. It was all planned. Try us and see. Send a\r\ncouple of guys in. They'll come out with the proof...\"\r\n\r\nOther voices were shouting. \"Wake up, you suckers...! You'll never take\r\nus, you stupid slobs...! Come on and try it, if that's what you want to\r\nbe...\"\r\n\r\nWhat happened, could never have happened so quickly if Parnay's\r\ndoubtless considerably disgruntled following hadn't been disturbed\r\nfurther by intrigue beforehand. Nelsen heard Parnay roar commands and\r\ncurses that might have awed many a man. But then there was a cluster of\r\nminute sparks in the distance, as rockets, not launched by the\r\ndefenders, homed and exploded.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then many voices were audible, shouting at the same\r\ntime, with scarcely any words clear... Several minutes passed like that.\r\nThen there was almost silence.\r\n\r\n\"So--has it happened?\" Nelsen growled into his phone.\r\n\r\n\"It has,\" came the mocking answer. \"Be cavalier, Nelsen. Salute the new\r\ntop outlaw... Don't faint-- I knew I'd make it... And don't try anything\r\nyou might regret... I'm coming in with a couple of my Jolly Lads. You'd\r\nbetter not welsh on your promises. Because the others are armed and\r\nwaiting...\"\r\n\r\nThe guys with Tiflin looked more tired than tough. Out from under their\r\nfierce, truculent bravado showed the fiercer hunger for common things\r\nand comforts. Nelsen knew. The record was in his own memory.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get your bubbs right away,\" he told them. \"Then send the others\r\nin, a pair at a time. After that, go and get lost. Make your own\r\nplace--town--whatever you want to call it... Leland, Crobert,\r\nSharpe--fit these guys out, will you...?\"\r\n\r\nAll this happened under the sardonic gaze of Glen Tiflin, and before the\r\npuzzled eyes of Joe Kuzak and Two-and-Two Baines. A dozen others were\r\nhovering near.\r\n\r\nNelsen lowered his voice and called, \"Nance?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered at once. \"I'm all right, Frank. A few people to patch. Some\r\nbeyond that. I'm in the hospital with Doc Forbes...\"\r\n\r\n\"You guys can find something useful to do,\" Nelsen snapped at the\r\ngathering crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frankie,\" Tiflin taunted. \"Aren't you going to invite me into\r\nyour fancy new quarters? Joe and Two-and-Two also look as though they\r\ncould stand a drink.\"\r\n\r\nOn the sundeck, Tiflin spoke again. \"I suppose you've got it figured,\r\nNelsen?\"\r\n\r\nNelsen answered him in clipped fashion. \"Thanks. But let's not dawdle\r\ntoo much. I've got a lot of wreckage to put back together... Maybe I've\r\nstill got it figured wrong, Tiflin. But lately I began to think the\r\nother way. You were always around when trouble was cooking--like part of\r\nit, _or like a good cop_. The first might still be right.\"\r\n\r\nTiflin sneered genially. \"Some cops can't carry badges. And they don't\r\nalways stop trouble, but they try... Anyhow, what side do you think I\r\nwas on, after Fessler kicked me around for months...? Let Igor go. He's\r\ngot law and order in his soul. I kind of like having him around... But\r\nkeep your mouths buttoned, will you? I'm talking to you, Mr. Baines, and\r\nyou, Mr. Kuzak, as well as to you, Nelsen. And I'm take my bubb along,\r\nthe same as the other ninety or so guys who are left from Parnay's\r\ncrowd. I've got to look good with them... Cheers, you slobs. See you\r\naround...\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Joe growled, \"Hell--what do you know! Him...! Special\r\nPolice. Undercover. U.N., U.S., or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up,\" Nelsen growled.\r\n\r\nThough he had sensed it coming and had met it calmly, the Tiflin switch\r\nwas something that Frank Nelsen had trouble getting over. It confused\r\nhim. It made him want to laugh.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that began to bother him even more was the realization\r\nthat the violence, represented by Fessler, Fanshaw, Parnay, and\r\nthousands of others like them back through history, was bound to crop up\r\nagain. It was part of the complicated paradox of human nature. And it\r\nwas hard to visualize a time when there wouldn't be followers--frustrated\r\nslobs who wanted to get out and kick over the universe. Nelsen had felt\r\nsuch urges cropping up within himself. So this wasn't the end of\r\ntrouble--especially not out here in raw space, that was still far too\r\nbig for man-made order.\r\n\r\nSo it wasn't just the two, opposed space navies patrolling, more quietly\r\nnow, between Ceres and Pallas. That condition could pass. The way people\r\nalways chose--or were born to--different sides was another matter. Or\r\nwas it just the natural competition of life in whatever form? More\r\ndisturbing, perhaps, was the mere fact of trying to live here, so close\r\nto natural forces that could kill in an instant.\r\n\r\nFor example, Nelsen often saw two children and a dog racing around\r\ninside one of the rotating bubbs--having fun as if just in a back yard.\r\nIf the stellene were ripped, the happy picture would change to horror...\r\nHow long would it take to get adjusted to--and accept--such a chance?\r\nThoughts like that began to disturb Nelsen. Out here, in all this\r\nenormous freedom, the shift from peaceful routine to tragedy could be\r\nquicker than ever before.\r\n\r\nBut is wasn't thinking about such grim matters that actually threw Frank\r\nNelsen--that got him truly mixed up. In Parnay's attack, ten men and two\r\nwomen had been killed. There were also twenty-seven injured. Such facts\r\nhe could accept--they didn't disturb him too much, either. Yet there was\r\na curious sort of straw that broke the camel's back, one might have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe incident took place quite a while after the assault. Out on an\r\ninspection tour in his Archer, he happened to glance through the\r\ntransparent wall of the sundeck of a prefab he was passing...\r\n\r\nIn a moment he was inside, grinning happily. Miss Rosalie Parks was\r\nlecturing him: \"... You needn't be surprised that I am here, Franklin.\r\n'O, tempora O, mores!' Cicero once said. 'O, the times! O, the customs!'\r\nBut we needn't be so pessimistic. I am in perfect health--and ten years\r\nbelow retirement age. Young people, I suspect, will still be taught\r\nLatin if they choose... Or there will be something else... Of course I\r\nhad heard of your project... It was quite easy for you not to notice my\r\narrival. But I came with the latest group, straight from Earth...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen was very pleased that Miss Parks was here. He told her so. He\r\nstayed for cakes and coffee. He told her that it was quite right for her\r\nto keep up with the times. He believed this, himself...\r\n\r\nAfterwards, though, in his own quarters, he began to laugh. Her presence\r\nwas so incongruous, so fantastic...\r\n\r\nHis laughter became wild. Then it changed to great rasping hiccups. Too\r\nmuch that was unbelievable by old standards had happened around him.\r\nThis was delayed reaction to space. He had heard of such a thing. But he\r\nhad hardly thought that it could apply to him, anymore...! Well, he\r\nknew what to do... Tranquilizer tablets were practically forgotten\r\nthings to him. But he gulped one now. In a few minutes, he seemed okay,\r\nagain...\r\n\r\nYet he couldn't help thinking back to the Bunch, the Planet Strappers.\r\nTo the wild fulfillment they had sought... So--most of them had made it.\r\nThey had become men--the hard way. Except, of course, Eileen--the\r\ndistaff side... They had planned, callowly, to meet and compare\r\nadventures in ten years. And this was still less than seven...\r\n\r\nHow long had it been since he had even beamed old Paul, in Jarviston...?\r\nNow that most of the Syrtis Fever had left him, it seemed futile even to\r\nconsider such a thing. It involved memories buried in enormous time,\r\ndistance, change, and unexpectedness.\r\n\r\nGlen Tiflin--the sour, space-wild punk who had become a cop. Had Tiflin\r\neven saved his--Frank Nelsen's--life, once, long ago, persuading a Jolly\r\nLad leader to cast him adrift for a joke, rather than to kill him and\r\nRamos outright...?\r\n\r\nCharlie Reynolds--the Bunch-member whom everybody had thought most\r\nlikely to succeed. Well, Charlie was dead from a simple thing, and\r\nburied on Venus. He was unknown--except to his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nJig Hollins, the guy who had played it safe, was just as dead.\r\n\r\nEileen Sands was a celebrity in Serene, in Pallastown and the whole\r\nBelt.\r\n\r\nMex Ramos--of the flapping squirrel tails on an old motor scooter--now\r\nbelonged to the history of exploration, though he no longer had real\r\nhands or feet, and, very likely, was now dead, somewhere out toward\r\ninterstellar space.\r\n\r\nDavid Lester, the timid one, had become successful in his own way, and\r\nwas the father of one of the first children to be born in the Belt.\r\n\r\nTwo-and-Two Baines had won enough self-confidence to make cracks about\r\nthe future. Gimp Hines, once the saddest case in the Whole Bunch, had\r\nbeen, for a long time, perhaps the best adjusted to the Big Vacuum.\r\n\r\nArt Kuzak, one-time hunkie football player, was a power among the\r\nasteroids. His brother, Joe, had scarcely changed, personally.\r\n\r\nAbout himself, Nelsen got the most lost. What had he become, after his\r\nwrong guesses and his great luck, and the fact that he had managed to\r\nsee more than most? Generally, he figured that he was still the same\r\nfree-wheeling vagabond by intention, but too serious to quite make it\r\nwork out. Sometimes he actually gave people orders. It came to him as a\r\nsurprise that he must be almost as rich as old J. John Reynolds, who\r\nwas still drawing wealth from a comparatively small loan--futilely at\r\nhis age, unless he had really aimed at the ideal of bettering the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nNelsen's busy mind couldn't stop. He thought of three other-world\r\ncultures he had glimpsed. Two had destroyed each other. The third and\r\nstrangest was still to be reckoned with...\r\n\r\nThere, he came to Mitch Storey, the colored guy with the romantic name.\r\nOf all the Planet Strappers, his history was the most fabulous. Maybe,\r\nnow, with a way of living in open space started, and with the planets\r\nultimately to serve only as sources of materials, Mitch's star people\r\nwould be left in relative peace for centuries.\r\n\r\nFrank Nelsen began to chuckle again. As if something, everything, was\r\nfunny. Which, perhaps, it was in a way. Because the whole view, personal\r\nand otherwise, seemed too huge and unpredictable for his wits to grasp.\r\nIt was as if neither he, nor any other person, belonged where he was at\r\nall. He checked his thoughts in time. Otherwise, he would have commenced\r\nhiccuping.\r\n\r\nThat was the way it went for a considerable succession of arbitrary\r\ntwenty-four hour day-periods. As long as he kept his attention on the\r\ntasks in hand, he was okay--he felt fine. Still, the project was\r\nproceeding almost automatically, just now. The first cluster of prefabs\r\nhad grown until it had been split into halves, which moved a million\r\nmiles apart, circling the sun. And he knew that there were other\r\nclusters, built by other outfits, growing and dividing into widely\r\nseparated portions of the same great ring-like zone.\r\n\r\nMaybe the old problems were beat. Safety? If deployment was the answer\r\nto that, it was certainly there--to a degree, at least. Room enough?\r\nCheck. It was certainly available. Freedom of mind and action? There\r\nwasn't much question that that would work out, too. Home, comfort, and a\r\nkind of life not too unfamiliar? In the light of detached logic and\r\nobservation, that was going fine, too. In the main, people were\r\nadjusting very quickly and eagerly. Perhaps _too_ quickly.\r\n\r\nThat was where Nelsen always got scared, as if he had become a nervous\r\nold man. The Big Vacuum had a grandeur. It could seem gentle. Could\r\nchildren, women and men--everybody sometimes forgot--learn to live with\r\nit without losing their respect for it, until suddenly it killed them?\r\n\r\nThat was the worst point, if he let himself think. And how could he\r\nalways avoid that? From there his thoughts would branch out into his\r\nmultiple uncertainties, confusions and puzzlements. Then those\r\nstrangling hiccups would come. And who could be taking devil-killers\r\nall the time?\r\n\r\nHe hadn't avoided Nance Codiss. He talked with her every day, lunched\r\nwith her, even held her hand. Otherwise, a restraint had come over him.\r\nBecause something was all wrong with him, and was getting worse. Just\r\none urge was clear, now, inside him. She knew, of course, that he was\r\nloused up; but she didn't say anything. Finally he told her.\r\n\r\n\"You were right, Nance. I was fumbling my way, too. Space fatigue, the\r\nmedic told me just a little while ago. He agrees with me that I should\r\ngo back to Earth. I've got to go--to take a look at everything from the\r\nsmall end, again. Of course I've always had the longing. And now I can\r\ngo. It has been a year since the worst of the Syrtis Fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had the fever. And sometimes the longing, Frank,\" she said after\r\nshe had studied him for a moment. \"I think I'd like to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only if you want to, Nance. It's me that's flunking out, pal.\" He\r\nchuckled apologetically, almost lightly. \"My part has to be a one-person\r\ndeal. I don't know whether I'll ever come back. And you seem to fit, out\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him coolly for almost a minute. \"All right, Frank,\" she\r\nsaid quietly. \"Follow your nose. It's just liable to be right on the\r\nbeam--for you. I might follow mine. I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joe and Two-and-Two are around--if you need anything, Nance,\" he said.\r\n\"I'll tell them. Gimp, I hear, is on the way. Not much point in my\r\nwaiting for him, though...\"\r\n\r\nSomehow he loved Nance Codiss as much or more than ever. But how could\r\nhe tell her that and make sense? Not much made sense to him anymore. It\r\nseemed that he had to get away from everybody that he had ever seen in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nFifty hours before his departure with a returning bubb caravan that had\r\nbrought more Earth-emigrants, Nelsen acquired a travelling companion who\r\nhad arrived from Pallastown with a small caravan bringing machinery. The\r\npassenger-hostess brought him to Nelsen's prefab. He was a grave little\r\nguy, five years old. He was solemn, polite, frightened, tall for his\r\nage--funny how corn and kids grew at almost zero-gravity.\r\n\r\nThe boy handed Nelsen a letter. \"From my father and mother, sir,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nNelsen read the typed missive.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Frank: The rumor has come that you are going home. You have our\r\nvery best wishes, as always. Our son, Davy, is being sent to his\r\npaternal grandmother, now living in Minneapolis. He will go to school\r\nthere. He is capable of making the trip without any special attention.\r\nBut--a small imposition. If you can manage it, please look in on him\r\nonce in a while, on the way. We would appreciate this favor. Thank you,\r\ntake care of yourself, and we shall hope to see you somewhere within the\r\nnext few months. Your sincere friends, David and Helen Lester.\"\r\n\r\nA lot of nerve, Nelsen thought first. But he tried to grin engagingly at\r\nthe kid and almost succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"We're in luck, Dave,\" he said. \"I'm going to Minneapolis, too. I'm\r\nafraid of a lot of things. What are you afraid of?\"\r\n\r\nThe small fry's jutting lip trembled. \"Earth,\" he said. \"A great big\r\nplanet. Hoppers tell me I won't even be able to stand up or breathe.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen very nearly laughed and went into hiccups, again. Fantastic.\r\nAnother viewpoint. Seeing through the other end of the telescope. But\r\nhow else would it be for a youngster born in the Belt, while being\r\nsent--in the old colonial pattern--to the place that his parents\r\nregarded as home?\r\n\r\n\"Those jokers,\" Nelsen scoffed. \"They're pulling your leg! It just isn't\r\nso, Davy. Anyhow, during the trip, the big bubb will be spun fast\r\nenough, so that we will get used to the greater Earth-gravity. Let me\r\ntell you something. I guess it's space and the Belt that _I'm_ afraid\r\nof. I never quite got over it. Silly, huh?\"\r\n\r\nBut as Nelsen watched the kid brighten, he remembered that he, himself,\r\nhad been scared of Earth, too. Scared to return, to show weakness, to\r\nlack pride... Well, to hell with that. He had accomplished enough, now,\r\nmaybe, to cancel such objections. Now it seemed that he had to get to\r\nEarth before it vanished because of something he had helped start.\r\nSilly, of course...\r\n\r\nHe and Davy travelled fast and almost in luxury. Within two weeks they\r\nwere in orbit around the bulk of the Old World. Then, in the powerful\r\ntender with its nuclear retard rockets, there was the Blast In--the\r\nreverse of that costly agony that had once meant hard won and enormous\r\nfreedom, when he was poor in money and rich in mighty yearning. But now\r\nNelsen yielded in all to the mother clutch of the gravity. The whole\r\nprocess had been gentled and improved. There were special anti-knock\r\nseats. There was sound- and vibration-insulation. Even Davy's slight\r\nfear was more than half thrill.\r\n\r\nAt the new Minneapolis port, Nelsen delivered David Lester, Junior into\r\nthe care of his grandmother, who seemed much more human than Nelsen once\r\nhad thought long ago. Then he excused himself quickly.\r\n\r\nSeeking the shelter of anonymity, he bought a rucksack for his few\r\nclothes, and boarded a bus which dropped him at Jarviston, Minnesota, at\r\ntwo a.m. He thrust his hands into his pockets, partly like a lonesome\r\ntramp, partly like some carefree immortal, and partly like a mixed-up\r\nwraith who didn't quite know who or what he was, or where he belonged.\r\n\r\nIn his wallet he had about five hundred dollars. How much more he might\r\nhave commanded, he couldn't even guess. Wups, fella, he told himself.\r\nThat's too weird, too indigestible--don't start hiccuping again. How old\r\nare you--twenty-five, or twenty-five thousand years? Wups--careful...\r\n\r\nThe full Moon was past zenith, looking much as it always had. The\r\nblue-tinted air domes of colossal industrial development, were mostly\r\ntoo small at this distance to be seen without a glass. Good...\r\n\r\nWith wondering absorption he sniffed the mingling of ripe field and road\r\nsmells, borne on the warm breeze of the late-August night. Some few cars\r\nevidently still ran on gasoline. For a moment he watched neon signs\r\nblink. In the desertion he walked past Lehman's Drug Store and Otto\r\nKramer's bar, and crossed over to pause for a nameless moment in front\r\nof Paul Hendricks' Hobby Center, which was all dark, and seemed little\r\nchanged. He took to a side street, and won back the rustle of trees and\r\nthe click of his heels in the silence.\r\n\r\nA few more buildings--that was about all that was visibly different in\r\nJarviston, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nA young cop eyed him as he returned to the main drag and paused near a\r\nstreet lamp. He had a flash of panic, thinking that the cop was\r\nsomebody, grown up, now, who would recognize him. But at least it was no\r\none that he remembered.\r\n\r\nThe cop grinned. \"Get settled in a hotel, buddy,\" he said. \"Or else move\r\non, out of town.\"\r\n\r\nNelsen grinned back, and ambled out to the highway, where intermittent\r\nclumps of traffic whispered.\r\n\r\nThere he paused, and looked up at the sky, again. The electric beacon of\r\na weather observation satellite blinked on and off, moving slowly. Venus\r\nhad long since set, with hard-to-see Mercury preceding it. Jupiter\r\nglowed in the south. Mars looked as remote and changeless as it must\r\nhave looked in the Stone Age. The asteroids were never even visible here\r\nwithout a telescope.\r\n\r\nThe people that he knew, and the events that he had experienced Out\r\nThere, were like myths, now. _How could he ever put Here and There\r\ntogether, and unite the mismatched halves of himself and his\r\nexperience?_ He had been born on Earth, the single home of his kind from\r\nthe beginning. How could he ever even have been Out There?\r\n\r\nHe didn't try to hitch a ride. He walked fourteen miles to the next\r\ntown, bought a small tent, provisions and a special, miniaturized\r\nradio. Then he slipped into the woods, along Hickman's Lake, where he\r\nused to go.\r\n\r\nThere he camped, through September, and deep into October. He fished, he\r\nswam again. He dropped stones into the water, and watched the circles\r\nform, with a kind of puzzled groping in his memory. He retreated from\r\nthe staggering magnificence of his recent past and clutched at old\r\nsimplicities.\r\n\r\nOn those rare occasions when he shaved, he saw the confused sickness in\r\nhis face, reflected by his mirror. Sometimes, for a moment, he felt hot,\r\nand then cold, as if his blood still held a tiny trace of Syrtis Fever.\r\nIf there _was_ such a thing? No--don't start to laugh, he warned\r\nhimself. Relax. Let the phantoms fade away. Somewhere, that multiple\r\nbigness of Nothing, of life and death, of success and unfairness and\r\nsurprise, must have reality--but not here...\r\n\r\nOccasionally he listened to news on the radio. But mostly he shut it\r\noff--out. Until boredom at last began to overtake him--because he had\r\nbeen used to so much more than what was here. Until--specifically--one\r\nmorning, when the news came too quickly, and with too much impact. It\r\nwas a recording, scratchy, and full of unthinkable distance.\r\n\r\n\"... Frank, Gimp, Two-and-Two, Paul, Mr. Reynolds, Otto, Les, Joe, Art,\r\neverybody--especially you, Eileen--remember what you promised, when I\r\nget back, Eileen...! Here I am, on Pluto--edge of the star desert! Clear\r\nsailing--all the way. All I see, yet, is twilight, rocks, mountains,\r\nsnow which must be frozen atmosphere--and one big star, Sol. But I'll\r\nget the data, and be back...\"\r\n\r\nNelsen listened to the end, with panic in his face--as if such\r\nadventures and such living were too gigantic and too rich... He hiccuped\r\nonce. Then he held himself very still and concentrated. He had known\r\nthat voice Out There and Here, too. Now, as he heard it again--Here, but\r\nfrom Out There--it became like a joining force to bring them both\r\ntogether within himself. Though how could it be...?\r\n\r\n\"Ramos,\" he said aloud. \"Made it... Another good guy, accomplishing what\r\nhe wanted... Hey...! Hey, that's swell... Like things should happen.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't hiccup anymore, or laugh. By being very careful, he just\r\ngrinned, instead. He arose to his feet, slowly.\r\n\r\n\"What am I doing here--wasting time?\" he seemed to ask the woods.\r\n\r\nWithout picking up his camping gear at all, he headed for the road,\r\nthumbed a ride to Jarviston, where he arrived before eight o'clock.\r\nSomebody had started ringing the city hall bell. Celebration?\r\n\r\nHendricks' was the most logical place for Nelsen to go, but he passed\r\nit by, following a hunch to his old street. _She_ had almost said that\r\nshe might come home, too. He touched the buzzer.\r\n\r\nNot looking too completely dishevelled himself, he stood there, as a\r\ngirl--briskly early in dress and impulse, so as not to waste the bright\r\nmorning--opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, Nance--me,\" he croaked apologetically. \"Ramos has reached Pluto!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, _Frankie_!\" she burst out.\r\n\r\nBut his words rushed on. \"I've been goofing off--by Hickman's Lake. Over\r\nnow. Emotional indigestion, I guess--from living too big, before I could\r\ntake it. I figured you _might_ be here. If you weren't, I'd come...\r\nBecause I know where I belong. Nance--I hope you're not angry. Maybe\r\nwe're pulling together, at last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Angry--when I was the first fumbler? How could that be, Frank? Oh, I\r\nknew where you were--folks found out. I told them to leave you alone,\r\nbecause I understood some of what you were digging through. Because it\r\nwas a little the same--for me... So, you see, I didn't just tag after\r\nyou.\" She laughed a little. \"That wouldn't be proud, would it? Even\r\nthough Joe and Two-and-Two said I had to go bring you back...\"\r\n\r\nHis arms went tight around her, right there on the old porch.\r\n\"Nance--love you,\" he whispered. \"And we've got to be tough. Everybody's\r\ngot to be tough--to match what we've come to. Even little kids. But it\r\nwas always like that--on any kind of frontier, wasn't it? A few will get\r\nkilled, but more will live--many more...\"\r\n\r\nLike that, Frank Nelsen shook the last of the cobwebs out of his\r\nbrain--and got back to his greater destiny.\r\n\r\n\"I'll buy all of that philosophy,\" Nance chuckled gently. \"But you still\r\nlook as though you needed some breakfast, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned. \"Later. Let's go to see Paul, first. A big day for\r\nhim--because of Ramos. Paul is getting feeble, I suppose?\" Nelsen's face\r\nhad sobered.\r\n\r\n\"Not so you could notice it much, Frank,\" Nance answered. \"There's a new\r\ntherapy--another side of What's Coming, I guess...\"\r\n\r\nThey walked the few blocks. The owner of the Hobby Center was now a\r\nlong-time member of KRNH Enterprises. He had the means to expand and\r\nmodernize the place beyond recognition. But clearly he had realized that\r\nsome things should not change.\r\n\r\nIn the display window, however, there gleamed a brand-new Archer Nine,\r\nbeautiful as a garden or a town floating, unsupported, under the\r\nstars--beautiful as the Future, which was born of the Past.\r\n\r\nA Bunch of fellas--the current crop of aficionados--were inside the\r\nstore, making lots of noise over the news. Was that Chip Potter, grown\r\ntall? Was that his same old dog, Blaster? Frank Nelsen could see Paul\r\nHendricks' white-fringed bald-spot.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead--open the door. Or are you still scared?\" Nance challenged\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\"No--just anticipating,\" Nelsen gruffed. \"And seeing if I can remember\r\nwhat's Out There ... Serene, bubb, Belt, Pallas...\" He spoke the words\r\nlike comic incantations, yet with a dash of reverence.\r\n\r\n\"Superbia?\" Nance teased.\r\n\r\n\"That is somebody's impertinent joke!\" he growled in feigned solemnity.\r\n\"Anyhow, it would be too bad if something _that_ important couldn't take\r\na little ribbing. Shucks--we've hardly _started_ to work, yet!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew Nance back a pace, out of sight of those in the store, and\r\nkissed her long and rather savagely.\r\n\r\n\"With all its super-complications, life still seems pretty nice,\" he\r\ncommented.\r\n\r\nThe door squeaked, just as it used to, as Nelsen pushed it open. The old\r\noverhead bell jangled.\r\n\r\nPale, watery eyes lifted and lighted with another fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank!
