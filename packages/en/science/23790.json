CAMPBELL\r\n THE ULTIMATE WEAPON\r\n\r\n When star fights star,\r\n is chaos the best defense?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SUN RISING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe star Mira was unpredictably variable. Sometimes it was blazing,\r\nbrilliant and hot. Other times it was oddly dim, cool, shedding little\r\nwarmth on its many planets. Gresth Gkae, leader of the Mirans, was\r\nseeking a better star, one to which his \"people\" could migrate. That\r\nstar had to be steady, reliable, with a good planetary system. And in\r\nhis astronomical searching, he found Sol.\r\n\r\nWith hundreds of ships, each larger than whole Terrestrial spaceports,\r\nand traveling faster than the speed of light, the Mirans set out to move\r\nin to Solar regions and take over.\r\n\r\nAnd on Earth there was nothing which would be capable of beating off\r\nthis incredible armada--until Buck Kendall stumbled upon THE ULTIMATE\r\nWEAPON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN W. CAMPBELL first started writing in 1930 when his first short\r\nstory, _When the Atoms Failed_, was accepted by a science-fiction\r\nmagazine. At that time he was twenty years old and still a student at\r\ncollege. As the title of the story indicates, he was even at that time\r\noccupied with the significance of atomic energy and nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nFor the next seven years, Campbell, bolstered by a scientific background\r\nthat ran from childhood experiments, to study at Duke University and the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote and sold science-fiction,\r\nachieving for himself an enviable reputation in the field.\r\n\r\nIn 1937 he became the editor of _Astounding Stories_ magazine and\r\napplied himself at once to the task of bettering the magazine and the\r\nfield of s-f writing in general. His influence on science-fiction since\r\nthen has been great. Today he still remains as the editor of that\r\nmagazine's evolved and redesigned successor, _Analog_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            _THE\r\n          ULTIMATE\r\n           WEAPON_\r\n\r\n\r\n             by\r\n      JOHN W.

Her six-man crew was taking it very easy, and\r\neasy meant two-man watches, and low speed, to watch for the instrument\r\npanel and attend ship into the bargain.\r\n\r\nShe was about thirty million miles off Pluto, just beginning to get in\r\ntouch with some of the larger mining stations out there, when Buck\r\nKendall's turn at the controls came along. Buck Kendall was one of\r\nlife's little jokes. When Nature made him, she was absentminded. Buck\r\nstood six feet two in his stocking feet, with his usual slight stoop in\r\noperation. When he forgot, and stood up straight, he loomed about two\r\ninches higher. He had the body and muscles of a dock navvy, which Nature\r\nstarted out to make. Then she forgot and added something of the same\r\nstuff she put in Sir Francis Drake. Maybe that made Old Nature nervous,\r\nand she started adding different things. At any rate, Kendall, as\r\nfinally turned out, had a brain that put him in the first rank of\r\nscientists--when he felt like it--the general constitution of an ostrich\r\nand a flair for gambling.\r\n\r\nThe present position was due to such a gamble. An IP man, a friend of\r\nhis, had made the mistake of betting him a thousand dollars he wouldn't\r\nget beyond a Captain's bars in the Patrol. Kendall had liked the idea\r\nanyway, and adding a bit of a bet to it made it irresistible. So, being\r\na very particular kind of a fool, the glorious kind which old Nature\r\nturns out now and then, he left a five million dollar estate on Long\r\nIsland, Terra, that same evening, and joined up in the Patrol. The Sir\r\nFrancis Drake strain had immediately come forth--and Kendall was having\r\nthe time of his life. In a six-man cruiser, his real work in the\r\nInterplanetary Patrol had started. He was still in it--but it was his\r\ncommand now, and a blue circle on his left sleeve gave his lieutenant's\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall had immediately proceeded to enlist in his command the IP\r\nman who had made the mistaken bet, and Rad Cole was on duty with him\r\nnow. Cole was the technician of the T-247. His rank as Technical\r\nEngineer was practically equivalent to Kendall's circle-rank, which made\r\nthe two more comfortable together.\r\n\r\nCole was listening carefully to the signals coming through from Pluto.\r\n\"That,\" he decided, \"sounds like Tad Nichols' fist. You can recognize\r\nthat broken-down truck-horse trot of his on the key as far away as you\r\ncan hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what it is?\" sighed Buck. \"I thought it was static mushing him\r\nat first. What's he like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like all the other damn fools who come out two billion miles to scratch\r\nrock, as if there weren't enough already on the inner planets. He's got\r\na rich platinum property. Sells ninety percent of his output to buy his\r\npower, and the other eleven percent for his clothes and food.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be an efficient miner,\" suggested Kendall, \"to maintain 101%\r\nproduction like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but his bank account is. He's figured out that's the most economic\r\nlevel of production. If he produces less, he won't be able to pay for\r\nhis heating power, and if he produces more, his operation power will\r\nburn up his bank account too fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmmm--sensible way to figure. A man after my own heart. How does he\r\nplan to restock his bank account?\"\r\n\r\n\"By mining on Mercury. He does it regularly--sort of a commuter. Out\r\nhere his power bills eat it up. On Mercury he goes in for potassium, and\r\nsells the power he collects in cooling his dome, of course. He's a good\r\nminer, and the old fool can make money down there.\" Like any really\r\nskilled operator, Cole had been sending Morse messages while he talked.\r\nNow he sat quiet waiting for the reply, glancing at the chronometer.\r\n\r\n\"I take it he's not after money--just after fun,\" suggested Buck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. He's after money,\" replied Cole gravely. \"You ask him--he's\r\ngoing to make his eternal fortune yet by striking a real bed of jovium,\r\nand then he'll retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, one of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all are,\" Cole laughed. \"Eternal hope, and the rest of it.\" He\r\nlistened a moment and went on. \"But old Nichols is a first-grade\r\nengineer. He wouldn't be able to remake that bankroll every time if he\r\nwasn't. You'll see his Dome out there on Pluto--it's always the best on\r\nthe planet. Tip-top shape. And he's a bit of an experimenter too.\r\nAh--he's with us.\"\r\n\r\nNichols' ragged signals were coming through--or pounding through. They\r\nwere worse than usual, and at first Kendall and Cole couldn't make them\r\nout. Then finally they got them in bursts. The man was excited, and his\r\nbad key-work made it worse. \"--Randing stopped. They got him I think. He\r\nsaid--th--ship as big--a--nsport. Said it wa--eaded my--ay. Neutrons--on\r\ninstruments--he's coming over the horizon--it's huge--war ship I\r\nthink--register--instru--neutrons--.\" Abruptly the signals were blanked\r\nout completely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCole and Kendall sat frozen and stiff. Each looked at the other abruptly,\r\nthen Kendall moved. From the receiver, he ripped out the recording coil,\r\nand instantly jammed it into the analyzer. He started it through once,\r\nthen again, then again, at different tone settings, till he found a very\r\nshrill whine that seemed to clear up most of Nichols' bad key-work.\r\n\"T-247--T-247--Emergency. Emergency. Randing reports the--over his\r\nhorizon. Huge--ip--reign manufacture. Almost spherical. Randing's stopped.\r\nThey got him I think. He said the ship was as big as a transport. Said\r\nit was headed my way. Neutrons--ont--gister--instruments. I think--is\r\nh--he's coming over the horizon. It's huge, and a war ship I\r\nthink--register--instruments--neutrons.\"\r\n\r\nKendall's finger stabbed out at a button. Instantly the noise of the\r\nother men, wakened abruptly by the mild shocks, came from behind.\r\nKendall swung to the controls, and Cole raced back to the engine room.\r\nThe hundred-foot ship shot suddenly forward under the thrust of her tail\r\nion-rockets. A blue-red cloud formed slowly behind her and expanded.\r\nTalbot appeared, and silently took her over from Kendall. \"Stations,\r\nmen,\" snapped Kendall. \"Emergency call from a miner of Pluto reporting a\r\nlarge armed vessel which attacked them.\" Kendall swung back, and eased\r\nhimself against the thrusting acceleration of the over-powered little\r\nship, toward the engine room. Cole was bending over his apparatus,\r\nmaking careful check-ups, closing weapon-circuits. No window gave view\r\nof space here; on the left was the tiny tender's pocket, on the right,\r\nabove and below the great water tanks that fed the ion-rockets, behind\r\nthe rockets themselves. The tungsten metal walls were cold and gray\r\nunder the ship lights; the hunched bulks of the apparatus crowded the\r\ntiny room. Gigantic racked accumulators huddled in the corners. Martin\r\nand Garnet swung into position in the fighting-tanks just ahead of the\r\npower rooms; Canning slid rapidly through the engine room, oozed through\r\na tiny door, and took up his position in the stern-chamber, seated\r\nhalf-over the great ion-rocket sheath.\r\n\r\n\"Ready in positions, Captain Kendall,\" called the war-pilot as the\r\nlittle green lights appeared on his board.\r\n\r\n\"Test discharges on maximum,\" ordered Kendall. He turned to Cole. \"You\r\nstart the automatic key?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, Captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"All shipshape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right as can be. Accumulators at thirty-seven per cent, thanks to the\r\nloaf out here. They ought to pick up our signal back on Jupiter, he's\r\nnearest now. The station on Europa will get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talbot--we are only to investigate if the ship is as reported. Have you\r\nseen any signs of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No sir, and the signals are blank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll work from here.\" Kendall took his position at the commanding\r\ncontrol. Cole made way for him, and moved to the power board. One by one\r\nhe tested the automatic doors, the pressure bulkheads. Kendall watched\r\nthe instruments as one after another of the weapons were tested on\r\nmomentary full discharge--titanic flames of five million volt protons.\r\nThen the ship thudded to the chatter of the Garnell rifles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTensely the men watched the planet ahead, white, yet barely visible in\r\nthe weak sunlight so far out. It was swimming slowly nearer as the tiny\r\nship gathered speed.\r\n\r\nKendall cast a glance over his detector-instruments. The radio network\r\nwas undisturbed, the magnetic and electric fields recognized only the\r\nslight disturbances occasioned by the planet itself. There was nothing,\r\nnoth--\r\n\r\nFive hundred miles away, a gigantic ship came into instantaneous being.\r\nSimultaneously, and instantaneously, the various detector systems howled\r\ntheir warnings. Kendall gasped as the thing appeared on his view screen,\r\nwith the scale-lines below. The scale must be cock-eyed. They said the\r\nship was fifteen hundred feet in diameter, and two thousand long!\r\n\r\n\"Retreat,\" ordered Kendall, \"at maximum acceleration.\"\r\n\r\nTalbot was already acting. The gyroscopes hummed in their castings, and\r\nthe motors creaked. The T-247 spun on her axis, and abruptly the\r\nacceleration built up as the ion-rockets began to shudder. A faint smell\r\nof \"heat\" began to creep out of the converter. Immense \"weight\" built\r\nup, and pressed the men into their specially designed seats--\r\n\r\nThe gigantic ship across the way turned slowly, and seemed to stare at\r\nthe T-247. Then it darted toward them at incredible speed till the poor\r\nlittle T-247 seemed to be standing still, as sailors say. The stranger\r\nwas so gigantic now, the screens could not show all of him.\r\n\r\n\"God, Buck--he's going to take us!\"\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the T-247 rolled, and from her broke every possible\r\nstream of destruction. The ion-rocket flames swirled abruptly toward\r\nher, the proton-guns whined their song of death in their housings, and\r\nthe heavy pounding shudder of the Garnell guns racked the ship.\r\n\r\nStrangely, Kendall suddenly noticed, there was a stillness in the ship.\r\nThe guns and the rays were still going--but the little human sounds\r\nseemed abruptly gone.\r\n\r\n\"Talbot--Garnet--\" Only silence answered him. Cole looked across at him\r\nin sudden white-faced amazement.\r\n\r\n\"They're gone--\" gasped Cole.\r\n\r\nKendall stood paralyzed for thirty seconds. Then suddenly he seemed to\r\ncome to life. \"Neutrons! Neutrons--and water tanks! Old Nichols was\r\nright--\" He turned to his friend. \"Cole--the tender--quick.\" He darted a\r\nglance at the screen. The giant ship still lay alongside. A wash of ions\r\nwas curling around her, splitting, and passing on. The pinprick\r\nexplosions of the Garnell shells dotted space around her--but never on\r\nher.\r\n\r\nCole was already racing for the tender lock. In an instant Kendall piled\r\nin after him. The tiny ship, scarcely ten feet long, was powered for\r\nflights of only two hours acceleration, and had oxygen for but\r\ntwenty-four hours for six men, seventy-two hours for two men--maybe. The\r\nheavy door was slammed shut behind them, as Cole seated himself at the\r\npanel. He depressed a lever, and a sudden smooth push shot them away\r\nfrom the T-247.\r\n\r\n\"DON'T!\" called Kendall sharply as Cole reached for the ion-rocket\r\ncontrol. \"Douse those lights!\" The ship was dark in dark space. The\r\nlighted hull of the T-247 drifted away from the little tender--further\r\nand further till the giant ship on the far side became visible.\r\n\r\n\"Not a light--not a sign of fields in operation.\" Kendall said,\r\nunconsciously speaking softly. \"This thing is so tiny, that it may\r\nescape their observation in the fields of the T-247 and Pluto down\r\nthere. It's our only hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened? How in the name of the planets did they kill those men\r\nwithout a sound, without a flash, and without even warning us, or\r\ninjuring us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neutrons--don't you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, I don't. I'm no scientist--merely a technician. Neutrons\r\naren't used in any process I've run across.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, remember they're uncharged, tiny things. Small as protons, but\r\nwithout electric field. The result is they pass right through an\r\nordinary atom without being stopped unless they make a direct hit.\r\nTungsten, while it has a beautifully high melting point, is mostly open\r\nspace, and a neutron just sails right through it, or any heavy atom.\r\nLight atoms stop neutrons better--there's less open space in 'em.\r\nHydrogen is best. Well--a man is made up mostly of light elements, and a\r\nman stops those neutrons--it isn't surprising it killed those other\r\nfellows invisibly, and without a sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they bathed that ship in neutrons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shot it full of 'em. Just like our proton guns, only sending neutrons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why weren't we killed too?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Water stops neutrons,' I said. Figure it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rocket-water tanks--all around us! Great masses of water--\" gasped\r\nCole. \"That saved us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. I wonder if they've spotted us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stranger ship was moving slowly in relation to the T-247. Suddenly\r\nthe motion changed, the stranger spun--and a giant lock appeared in her\r\nside, opened. The T-247 began to move, floated more and more rapidly\r\nstraight for the lock. Her various weapons had stopped operating now,\r\nthe hoppers of the Garnell guns exhausted, the charge of the\r\naccumulators aboard the ship down so low the proton guns had died out.\r\n\r\n\"Lord--they're taking the whole ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say--Cole, is that any ship you ever heard of before? _I don't think\r\nthat's just a pirate!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a pirate--what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"How'd he get inside our detector screens so fast? Watch--he'll either\r\nleave, or come after us--\" The T-247 had settled inside the lock now,\r\nand the great metal door closed after it. The whole patrol ship had been\r\nswallowed by a giant. Kendall was sketching swiftly on a notebook,\r\nwatching the vast ship closely, putting down a record of its lines, and\r\nformation. He glanced up at it, and then down for a few more lines, and\r\nup at it--\r\n\r\nThe stranger ship abruptly dwindled. It dwindled with incredible speed,\r\nrushing off along the line of sight at an impossible velocity, and\r\nabruptly clicking out of sight, like an image on a movie-film that has\r\nbeen cut, and repaired after the scene that showed the final\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Cole--Cole--did you get that? Did you see--do you understand what\r\nhappened?\" Kendall was excitedly shouting now.\r\n\r\n\"He missed us,\" Cole sighed. \"It's a wonder--hanging out here in space,\r\nwith the protector of the T-247's fields gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, you asteroid--that's not it. _He went off faster than light\r\nitself!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh--what? Faster than _light_? That can't be done--\"\r\n\r\n\"He did it, I know he did. That's how he got inside our screens. He came\r\ninside faster than the warning message could relay back the information.\r\nDidn't you see him accelerate to an impossible speed in an impossible\r\ntime? Didn't you see how he just vanished as he exceeded the speed of\r\nlight, and stopped reflecting it? _That ship was no ship of this solar\r\nsystem!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did he come from then?\"\r\n\r\n\"God only knows, but it's a long, long way off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IP-M-122 picked them up. The M-122 got out there two days later, in\r\nresponse to the calls the T-247 had sent out. As soon as she got within\r\nten million miles of the little tender, she began getting Cole's\r\nsignals, and within twelve hours had reached the tiny thing, located it,\r\nand picked it up.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jim Warren was in command, one of the old school commanders of\r\nthe IP. He listened to Kendall's report, listened to Cole's tale--and\r\nradioed back a report of his own. Space pirates in a large ship had\r\nattacked the T-247, he said, and carried it away. He advised a close\r\nwatch. On Pluto, his investigations disclosed nothing more than the fact\r\nthat three mines had been raided, all platinum supplies taken, and the\r\nrecords and machinery removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe M-122 was a fifty-man patrol cruiser, and Warren felt sure he could\r\nhandle the menace alone, and hung around for over two weeks looking for\r\nit. He saw nothing, and no further reports came of attack. Again and\r\nagain, Kendall tried to convince him this ship he was hunting was no\r\nmere space pirate, and again and again Warren grunted, and went on his\r\nway. He would not send in any report Kendall made out, because to do so\r\nwould add his endorsement to that report. He would not take Kendall\r\nback, though that was well within his authority.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was a full month before Kendall again set foot on any of the\r\nMinor Planets, and then it was Mars, the base of the M-122. Kendall and\r\nCole took passage immediately on an IP supply ship, and landed in New\r\nYork six days later. At once, Kendall headed for Commander McLaurin's\r\noffice. Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP, found he would have to make\r\nregular application to see McLaurin through a dozen intermediate\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Kendall was savagely determined to see McLaurin himself,\r\nand see him in the least possible time. Cole, too, was beginning to\r\nbelieve in Kendall's assertion of the stranger ship's extra-systemic\r\norigin. As yet neither could understand the strange actions of the\r\nmachine, its attack on the Pluto mines, and the capture and theft of a\r\npatrol ship.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" said Kendall angrily, \"just one way to see McLaurin and see\r\nhim quick. And, by God, I'm going to. Will you resign with me, Cole?\r\nI'll see him within a week then, I'll bet.\"\r\n\r\nFor a minute, Cole hesitated. Then he shook hands with his friends.\r\n\"Today!\" And that day it was. They resigned, together. Immediately, Buck\r\nKendall got the machinery in motion for an interview, working now from\r\nthe outside, pulling the strings with the weight of a hundred million\r\ndollar fortune. Even the IP officers had to pay a bit of attention when\r\nBernard Kendall, multi-millionaire began talking and demanding things.\r\nWithin a week, Kendall _did_ see McLaurin.\r\n\r\nAt that time, McLaurin was fifty-three years old, his crisp hair still\r\nblack as space, with scarcely a touch of the gray that appears in his\r\nmore recent photographs. He stood six feet tall, a broad-shouldered,\r\npowerful man, his face grave with lines of intelligence and character.\r\nThere was also a permanent narrowing of the eyes, from years under the\r\nblazing sun of space. But most of all, while those years in space had\r\nnarrowed and set his eyes, they had not narrowed and set his mind. An\r\ninfinitely finer character than old Jim Warren, his experience in space\r\nhad taught him always to expect the unexpected, to understand the\r\nincomprehensible as being part of the unknown and incalculable\r\nproperties of space and the worlds that swam in it. Besides the fine\r\ntechnical education he had started with, he had acquired a liberal\r\neducation in mankind. When Buck Kendall, straight and powerful, came\r\ninto his office with Cole, he recognized in him a character that would\r\ndrive steadily and straight for its goal. Also, he recognized behind the\r\nmillionaire that had succeeded in pulling wires enough to see him, the\r\nscientist who had had more than one paper published \"in an amateur way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Bernard Kendall?\" he asked, rising.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Late Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP. I quit and got Cole\r\nhere to quit with me, so we could see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unusual tactics. I've had several men join up to get an interview with\r\nme.\" McLaurin smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can imagine that, but we had to see you in a hurry. A hidebound\r\nold rapscallion by the name of Jim Warren picked us up out by Pluto,\r\nfloating around in a six-man tender. We made some reports to him, but he\r\nwouldn't believe, and he wouldn't send them through--so we had to send\r\nourselves through. Sir, this system is about to be attacked by some\r\nextra-systemic race. The IP-T-247 was so attacked, her crew killed off,\r\nand the ship itself carried away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got the report Captain Jim Warren sent through, stating it was a gang\r\nof space pirates. Now what makes you believe otherwise?\"\r\n\r\n\"That ship that attacked us, attacked with a neutron gun, a gun that\r\nshot neutrons through the hull of our ship as easily as protons pass\r\nthrough open space. Those neutrons killed off four of the crew, and\r\nspared us only because we happened to be behind the water tanks. Masses\r\nof hydrogen will stop neutrons, so we lived, and escaped in the tender.\r\nThe little tender, lightless, escaped their observation, and we were\r\npicked up. Now, when the 247 had been picked up, and locked into their\r\nship, that ship started accelerating. It accelerated so fast along my\r\nline of sight that it just dwindled, and--vanished. It didn't vanish in\r\ndistance, it vanished _because it exceeded the speed of light_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. It can be done--if you can find some way of escaping from\r\nthis space to do it. Now if you could cut across through a higher\r\ndimension, your _projection_ in this dimension might easily exceed the\r\nspeed of light. For instance, if I could cut directly through the Earth,\r\nat a speed of one thousand miles an hour, my projection on the surface\r\nwould go twelve thousand miles while I was going eight. Similar, if you\r\ncould cut _through_ the four dimensional space instead of following its\r\nsurface, you'd attain a speed greater than light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not still be a space pirate? That's a lot easier to believe,\r\neven allowing your statement that he exceeded the speed of light.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you invented a neutron gun which could kill through tungsten walls\r\nwithout injuring anything within, a system of accelerating a ship that\r\ndidn't affect the inhabitants of that ship, and a means of exceeding the\r\nspeed of light, all within a few months of each other, would you become\r\na pirate? I wouldn't, and I don't think any one else would. A pirate is\r\na man who seeks adventure and relief from work. Given a means of\r\nexceeding the speed of light, I'd get all the adventure I wanted\r\ninvestigating other planets. If I didn't have a cent before, I'd have\r\nrelief from work by selling it for a few hundred millions--and I'd sell\r\nit mighty easily too, for an invention like that is worth an\r\nincalculable sum. Tie to that the value of compensated acceleration, and\r\nno man's going to turn pirate. He can make more millions selling his\r\ninventions than he can make thousands turning pirate with them. So who'd\r\nturn pirate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\" McLaurin nodded. \"I see your point. Now before I'd accept your\r\nstatements _in re_ the 'speed of light' thing, I'd want opinions from\r\nsome IP physicists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's have a conference, because something's got to be done soon.\r\nI don't know why we haven't heard further from that fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Privately--we have,\" McLaurin said in a slightly worried tone. \"He was\r\ndetected by the instruments of every IP observatory I suspect. We got\r\nthe reports but didn't know what to make of them. They indicated so many\r\nfunny things, they were sent in as accidental misreadings of the\r\ninstruments. But since _all_ the observatories reported them, similar\r\nmisreadings, at about the same times, that is with variations of only a\r\nfew hours, we thought something must have been up. The only thing was\r\nthe phenomena were reported progressively from Pluto to Neptune, clear\r\nacross the solar system, in a definite progression, but at a velocity of\r\ncrossing that didn't tie in with any conceivable force. They crossed\r\nfaster than the velocity of light. That ship must have spent about half\r\nan hour off each planet before passing on to the next. And, accepting\r\nyour faster-than-light explanation, we can understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think you have proof.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we have, what would you do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get to work on those 'misreadings' of the instruments for one thing,\r\nand for a second, and more important, line every IP ship with paraffin\r\nblocks six inches thick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paraffin--why?\"\r\n\r\n\"The easiest form of hydrogen to get. You can't use solid hydrogen,\r\nbecause that melts too easily. Water can be turned into steam too\r\neasily, and requires more work. Paraffin is a solid that's largely\r\nhydrogen. That's what they've always used on neutrons since they\r\ndiscovered them. Confine your paraffin between tungsten walls, and\r\nyou'll stop the secondary protons as well as the neutrons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmmm--I suppose so. How about seeing those physicists?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see them today, sir. The sooner you get started on this\r\nwork, the better it will be for the IP.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having seen me, will you join up in the IP again?\" asked McLaurin.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I don't think I will. I have another field you know, in which\r\nI may be more useful. Cole here's a better technician than fighter--and\r\na darned good fighter, too--and I think that an inexperienced\r\nspace-captain is a lot less useful than a second-rate physicist at work\r\nin a laboratory. If we hope to get anywhere, or for that matter, I\r\nsuspect, stay anywhere, we'll have to do a lot of research pretty\r\npromptly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your explanation of that ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of two things: an inventor of some other system trying out his\r\nlatest toy, or an expedition sent out by a planetary government for\r\nexploration. I favor the latter for two reasons: that ship was _big_. No\r\ninventor would build a thing that size, requiring a crew of several\r\nhundred men to try out his invention. A government would build just\r\nabout that if they wanted to send out an expedition. If it were an\r\ninventor, he'd be interested in meeting other people, to see what they\r\nhad in the way of science, and probably he'd want to do it in a\r\npeaceable way. That fellow wasn't interested in peace, by any means. So\r\nI think it's a government ship, and an unfriendly government. They sent\r\nthat ship out either for scientific research, for trade research and\r\nexploration, or for acquisitive exploration. If they were out for\r\nscientific research, they'd proceed as would the inventor, to establish\r\nfriendly communication. If they were out for trade, the same would\r\napply. If they were out for acquisitive exploration, they'd investigate\r\nthe planets, the sun, the people, only to the extent of learning how\r\nbest to overcome them. They'd want to get a sample of our people, and a\r\nsample of our weapons. They'd want samples of our machinery, our\r\nliterature and our technology. That's exactly what that ship got.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody, somewhere out there in space, either doesn't like their home,\r\nor wants more home. They've been out looking for one. I'll bet they sent\r\nout hundreds of expeditions to thousands of nearby stars, gradually\r\ngoing further and further, seeking a planetary system. This is probably\r\nthe one and only one they found. It's a good one too. It has planets at\r\nall temperatures, of all sizes. It is a fairly compact one, it has a\r\nstable sun that will last far longer than any race can hope to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm--how can there be good and bad planetary systems?\" asked McLaurin.\r\n\"I'd never thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nKendall laughed. \"Mighty easy. How'd you like to live on a planet of a\r\nCepheid Variable? Pleasant situation, with the radiation flaring up and\r\ndown. How'd you like to live on a planet of Antares? That blasted sun\r\nis so big, to have a comfortable planet you'd have to be at least ten\r\nbillion miles out. Then if you had an interplanetary commerce, you'd\r\nhave to struggle with orbits tens of billions of miles across instead of\r\nmere millions. Further, you'd have a sun so blasted big, it would take\r\nan impossible amount of energy to lift the ship up from one planet to\r\nanother. If your trip was, say, twenty billions of miles to the next\r\nplanet, you'd be fighting a gravity as bad as the solar gravity at Earth\r\nhere all the way--no decline with a little distance like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-m-m-m--quite true. Then I should say that Mira would take the prize.\r\nIt's a red giant, and it's an irregular variable. The sunlight there\r\nwould be as unstable as the weather in New England. It's almost as big\r\nas Antares, and it won't hold still. Now that _would_ make a bad\r\nplanetary system.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would!\" Kendall laughed. But as we know--he laughed too soon, and he\r\nshouldn't have used the conditional. He should have said, \"It does!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae, Commander of Expeditionary Force 93, of the Planet Sthor,\r\nwas returning homeward with joyful mind. In the lock of his great ship,\r\nlay the T-247. In her cargo holds lay various items of machinery, mining\r\nsupplies, foods, and records. And in her log books lay the records of\r\nmany readings on the nine larger planets of a highly satisfactory\r\nplanetary system.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae had spent no less than three ultra-wearing years going from\r\none sun to another in a definitely mapped out section of space. He had\r\ninvestigated only eleven stars in that time, eleven stars, progressively\r\nfurther from the titanic red-flaming sun he knew as \"the\" sun. He knew\r\nit as \"the\" sun, and had several other appellations for it. Mira was\r\nso-named by Earthmen because it was indeed a \"wonder\" star, in Latin,\r\nmirare means \"to wonder.\" Irregularly, and for no apparent reason it\r\nwould change its rate of radiation. So far as those inhabitants of Sthor\r\nand her sister world Asthor knew, there was no reason. It just did it.\r\nPerhaps with malicious intent to be annoying. If so, it was\r\nexceptionally successful. Sthor and Asthor experienced, periodically, a\r\nyoung ice age. When Mira decided to take a rest, Sthor and Asthor froze\r\nup, from the poles most of the way to the equators. Then Mira would\r\nstretch herself a little, move about restlessly and Sthor and Asthor\r\nwould become uninhabitably hot, anywhere within twenty degrees of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nThose Sthorian people had evolved in a way that made the conditions\r\nendurable for savage or uncivilized people, but when a scientific\r\ncivilization with a well-ordered mode of existence tried to establish\r\nitself, Mira was all sorts of a nuisance.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae was a peculiar individual to human ways of thinking. He\r\nstood some seven feet tall, on his strange, double-kneed legs and his\r\nfour toed feet. His body was covered with little, short feather-like\r\nthings that moved now with a volition of their own. They were moving\r\nvery slowly and regularly. The space-ship was heated to a comfortable\r\ntemperature, and the little fans were helping to cool Gresth Gkae. Had\r\nit been cold, every little feather would have lain down close against\r\nits neighbors, forming an admirable, wind-proof and cold-proof blanket.\r\n\r\nNature, on Sthor, had original ideas of arrangement too. Sthorians\r\npossessed two eyes--one directly above the other, in the center of their\r\nfaces. The face was so long, and narrow, it resembled a blunt hatchet,\r\nwith the two eyes on the edge. To counter-balance this vertical\r\narrangement of the eyes, the nostrils had been separated some four\r\ninches, with one on each of the sloping cheeks. His ears were little\r\npink-flesh cups on short, muscular stems. His mouth was narrow, and\r\nsmall, but armed with quite solid teeth adapted to his diet, a diet\r\nconsisting of almost anything any creature had ever considered edible.\r\nLike most successful forms of intelligent life, Gresth Gkae was\r\nomnivorous. An intelligent form of life is necessarily adaptable, and\r\nadaptation meant being able to eat what was at hand.\r\n\r\nOne of his eyes, the upper one, was fully twice the size of the lower\r\none. This was his telescopic eye. The lower, or microscopic eye was\r\nadapted to work for which a human being would have required a low power\r\nmicroscope, the upper eye possessed a more normal power of vision,\r\n_plus_ considerable telescopic powers.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae was using it now to look ahead in the blank of space to\r\nwhere gigantic Mira appeared. On his screens now, Mira appeared deep\r\nviolet, for he was approaching at a speed greater than that of light,\r\nand even this projected light of Mira was badly distorted.\r\n\r\n\"The distance is half a light-year now, sir,\" reported the navigation\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\"Reduce the speed, then, to normal velocity for these ranges. What\r\nreserve of fuel have we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Less than one thousand pounds. We will barely be able to stop. We were\r\ntoo free in the use of our weapons, I fear,\" replied the Chief\r\nTechnician.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what would you? We needed those things in our reports. Besides,\r\nwe could extract fuel from that ore we took on at Planet Nine of Phahlo.\r\nIt is merely that I wish speed in the return.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we all do. How soon do you believe the Council will proceed against\r\nthe new system?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be fully a year, I fear. They must gather the expeditions\r\ntogether, and re-equip the ships. It will be a long time before all will\r\nhave come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could they not send fast ships after them to recall them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could they have traced us as we wove our way from Thart to Karst to\r\nRaloork to Phahlo? It would be impossible.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSteadily the great ship had been boring on her way. Mira had been a disc\r\nfor nearly two days, gigantic, two-hundred-and-fifty-million-mile Mira\r\ntook a great deal of dwarfing by distance to lose her disc. Even at the\r\nTwin Planets, eight thousand two hundred and fifty millions of miles\r\nout, Mira covered half the sky, it seemed, red and angry. Sometimes,\r\nthough, to the disgust of the Sthorians it was just red-faced and lazy.\r\nThen Sthor froze.\r\n\r\n\"Grih is in a descendant stage,\" said the navigation officer presently.\r\n\"Sthor will be cold when we arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will warm quickly enough with our news!\" Gresth laughed. \"A\r\nsystem--a delightful system--discovered. A system of many close-grouped\r\nplanets. Why think--from one side of that system to the other is less of\r\na distance than from Ansthat, our first planet's orbit, to Insthor's\r\norbit! That sun, as we know, is steady and warm. All will be well, when\r\nwe have eliminated that rather peculiar race. Odd, that they should, in\r\nsome ways, be so nearly like us! Nearly Sthorian in build. I would not\r\nhave expected it. Though they did have some amazing peculiarities!\r\nImagine--two eyes just alike, and in a horizontal row. And that flat\r\nface. They looked as though they had suffered some accident that smashed\r\nthe front of the face in. And also the peculiar beak-like projection.\r\nWhy should a race ever develop so amazing a projection in so peculiar\r\nand exposed a position? It sticks out inviting attack and injury. Right\r\nin the middle of the face. And to make it worse, there is the\r\nair-channel, and the only air channel. Why, one minor injury to the\r\nthroat would be certain to damage that passage beyond repair, and bring\r\ndeath. Yet such relatively unimportant things as ears, and eyes are\r\ndoubled. Surely you would expect that so important a member as the\r\nair-passage would be doubled for safety.\r\n\r\n\"Those strange, awkward arms and legs were what puzzled me. I have been\r\nattempting to manipulate myself as they must be forced to, and I cannot\r\nsee how delicate or accurate manual manipulation would be possible with\r\nthose rigid, inflexible arms. In some ways I feel they must have had\r\nclever minds to overcome so great a handicap to constructive work. But I\r\nsuppose single joints in the arms become as natural to them as our own\r\nmore mobile two.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if life in any intelligent form wouldn't develop somewhat\r\nsimilar formations, though. Think, in all parts of Sthor, before men\r\nbecame civilized and developed communication, even so much as twenty\r\nthousand years ago, our records show that seats and chairs were much as\r\nthey are today, and much as they are, in all places among all groups.\r\nThen too, the eye has developed in many different species, and always\r\nreached much the same structure. When a thing is intended and developed\r\nto serve a given purpose, no matter who develops it, or where or how, is\r\nit not apt to have similar shapes and parts? A chair must have legs, and\r\na seat and arm-rests and a back. You may vary their nature and their\r\nshape, but not widely, and they must be there. An eye must, anywhere,\r\nhave a sensitive retina, an adjustable lens, and an adjustable device\r\nfor controlling the entrance of light. Similarly there are certain\r\nfunctions that the body of an intelligent creature must serve which\r\nnaturally tend to make intelligent creatures similar. He must have a\r\ntool--the hand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--I see your point. It must be so, for surely these creatures\r\nout there are strange enough in other ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell me, have you calculated when we shall land?\"\r\n\r\n\"In twelve hours, thirty-three minutes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nEleven hours later, the expedition ship had slowed to a normal\r\nspace-speed. On her left hung the giant globe of Asthor, rotating\r\nslowly, moving slowly in her orbit. Directly ahead, Sthor loomed even\r\ngreater. Tiny Teelan, the thousand-mile diameter moon of the Insthor\r\nsystem shone dull red in the reflected light of gigantic Mira. Mira\r\nherself was gigantic, red and menacing across eight and a quarter\r\nbillions of miles of space.\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand miles apart, the twin worlds Sthor and Asthor\r\nrotated about their common center of gravity, eternally facing each\r\nother. Ten million miles from their common center of gravity, Teelan\r\nrotated in a vast orbit.\r\n\r\nSthor and Asthor were capped at each pole now by gigantic white icecaps.\r\nMira was sulking, and as a consequence the planets were freezing.\r\n\r\nThe expedition ship sank slowly toward Sthor. A swarm of smaller craft\r\nhad flown up at its approach to meet it. A gaily-colored small ship\r\nmarked the official greeting-ship. Gresth had withheld his news\r\npurposely. Now suddenly he began broadcasting it from the powerful\r\ntransmitter on his ship. As the words came through on a thousand sets,\r\nall the little ships began to whirl, dance and break out into glowing,\r\nsparkling lights. On Sthor and Asthor even commotions began to be\r\nvisible. A new planetary system had been found-- They could move! Their\r\noverflowing populations could be spread out!\r\n\r\nThe whole Insthor system went mad with delight as the great\r\nExpeditionary Ship settled downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a glint of humor in Buck Kendall's eyes as he passed the sheet\r\nover to McLaurin. Commander McLaurin looked down the columns with\r\ntwinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Petition to establish the Lunar Mining Bank,'\" he read. \"What a bank!\r\nOfficers: President, General James Logan, late of the IP;\r\nVice-president, Colonel Warren Gerardhi, also late of the IP; Staff,\r\nconsists of 90% ex-IP men, and a few scattered accountants. Designed by\r\nthe well-known designer of IP stations, Colonel Richard Murray.\"\r\nCommander McLaurin looked up at Kendall with a broad grin. \"And you\r\nactually got Interplanetary Life to give you a mortgage on the\r\nstructure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It'll cut cost fifty-eight millions, with its twelve-foot\r\ntungsten-beryllium walls and the heavy defense weapons against those\r\nterrible pirates. You know we must defend our property.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the thing you're setting up out there on Luna, you could more\r\nreadily wipe out the IP than anything else I know of. Any new defense\r\nideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty. Did you get any further appropriations from the IP\r\nAppropriations Board?\"\r\n\r\nMcLaurin looked sour. \"No. The dear taxpayers might object, and those\r\nthickheaded, clogged rockets on the Board can't see your data on the\r\nStranger. They gave me just ten millions, and that only because you\r\ndemonstrated you could shoot every living thing out of the latest IP\r\ncruiser with that neutron gun of yours. By the way, they may kick when I\r\ndon't install more than a few of those.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em. You can stall for a few months. You'll need that money more\r\nfor other purposes. You've installed that paraffin lining?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I got a report on that of 'finished' last week. How have you made\r\nout?\"\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall's face fell. \"Not so hot. Devin's been the biggest help--he\r\ndid most of the work on that neutron gun really--\"\r\n\r\n\"After,\" McLaurin interrupted, \"you told him how.\"\r\n\r\n\"--but we're pretty well stuck now, it seems. You'll be off duty\r\ntomorrow evening, can't you drop around to the lab? We're going to try\r\nout a new system for releasing atomic energy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that a pretty faint hope? We've been trying to get it for three\r\ncenturies now, and haven't yet. What chance at it within a year or\r\nso?--which is the time you allow yourself before the Stranger returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, I'll admit that. But there's another factor, not to be\r\nforgotten. The data we got from correlating those 'misreadings' from the\r\nvarious IP posts mean a lot. We are working on an entirely different\r\ntrail now. You come on out, and you can see our new apparatus. They are\r\nworking on tremendous voltages, and hoping to smash the thing by a\r\nbrutal bombardment of terrific voltage. We're trying, thanks to the\r\nresults of those instruments, to get results with small, terrifically\r\nintense fields.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that's their general system?\"\r\n\r\n\"They left traces on the records of the post instruments. These records\r\nshow such intensities as we never got. They have atomic energy,\r\nnecessarily, and they might have had material energy, actual destruction\r\nof matter, but apparently, from the field readings it's the former. To\r\nbe able to make those tremendous hops, light-years in length, they\r\nneeded a real store of energy. They have accumulators, of course, but I\r\ndon't think they could store enough power by the system they use to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how's your trick 'bank' out on Luna, despite its twelve-foot\r\nwalls, going to stand an atomic explosion?\"\r\n\r\n\"More protective devices to come is our only hope. I'm working on three\r\ntrails: atomic energy, some type of magnetic shield that will stop any\r\nmoving material particle, and their faster-than-light thing. Also, that\r\nfortress--I mean, of course, bank--is going to have a lot of lead-lined\r\nrooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could use the remaining money the Board gave me to lead-line a\r\nlot of those IP ships,\" said McLaurin wistfully. \"Can't you make a\r\ngamma-ray bomb of some sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not without their atomic energy release. With it, of course, it's easy\r\nto flood a region with rays. It'll be a million times worse than radium\r\n'C,' which is bad enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll send through this petition for armaments. They'll pass it\r\nall right, I think. They may get some kicks from old Jacob Ezra Stubbs.\r\nJacob Ezra doesn't believe in anything war-like. I wish they'd find some\r\nway to keep him off of the Arms Petition Board. He might just as well\r\nstay home and let 'em vote his ticket uniformly 'nay.'\" Buck Kendall\r\nleft with a laugh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall had his troubles though. When he had reached Earth again,\r\nhe found that his properties totaled one hundred and three million\r\ndollars, roughly. One doesn't sell properties of that magnitude, one\r\nborrows against them. But to all intents and purposes, Buck Kendall\r\nowned two half-completed ship's hulls in the Baldwin Spaceship Yards, a\r\ngreat deal of massive metal work on its way to Luna, and contracts for\r\nsome very extensive work on a \"bank.\" Beyond that, about eleven million\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the money had been invested in a laboratory, the like\r\nof which the world had never seen. It was devoted exclusively to\r\nphysics, and principally the physics of destruction. Dr. Paul Devin was\r\nthe Director, Cole was in charge of the technical work, and Buck Kendall\r\nwas free to do all the work he thought needed doing.\r\n\r\nReturned to his laboratory, he looked sourly at the bench on which seven\r\nmechanicians were working. The ninth successive experiment on the\r\nrelease of atomic energy had failed. The tenth was in process of\r\nconstruction. A heavy pure tungsten dome, three feet in diameter, three\r\ninches thick, was being lowered over a clear insulum dome, a foot\r\nsmaller. Inside, the real apparatus was arranged around the little pool\r\nof mercury. From it, two massive tungsten-copper alloy conductors led\r\nthrough the insulum housing, and outside. These, so Kendall had hoped,\r\nwould surge with the power of broken atoms, but he was beginning to\r\nbelieve rather bitterly, they would never do so.\r\n\r\nBuck went on to his offices, and the main calculator room. There were\r\nten calculator tables here, two of them in operation now.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Devin. Getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Devin bitterly, \"I'm getting off. Look at these results.\" He\r\nbrought over a sheaf of graphs, with explanatory tables attached.\r\nRapidly Buck ran through them with him. Most of them were graphs of\r\nfunctions of light, considered as a wave in these experiments.\r\n\r\n\"H-m-m-m--not very encouraging. Looks like you've got the field--but it\r\njust snaps shut on itself and won't work. The lack of volume makes it\r\nbreak down, if you establish it, and makes it impossible to establish in\r\nthe first place without the energy of matter. Not so hot. That's\r\ncertainly cock-eyed somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not. The math may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well\"--Kendall grinned--\"it amounts to the same thing. The point is,\r\nlight doesn't. Let's run over that theory again. Light is not only\r\nmagnetic; but electric. Somehow it transforms electric fields cyclically\r\ninto magnetic fields and back again. Now what we want to do is to\r\ntransform an electric into a magnetic field and have it stay there.\r\nThat's the first step. The second thing, is to have the lines of\r\nmagnetic force you develop, lie down like a sheath around the ship,\r\ninstead of standing out like the hairs on an angry cat, the way they\r\nwant to. That means turning them ninety degrees, and turning an electric\r\ninto a magnetic field means turning the space-strain ninety degrees.\r\nLight evidently forms a magnetic field whose lines of force reach along\r\nits direction of motion, so that's your starting point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and _that_,\" growled Devin, \"seems to be the finishing point.\r\nQuite definitely and clearly, the graph looped down to zero. In other\r\nwords, the field closed in on itself, and destroyed itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Light doesn't vanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you all the lights you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I simply mean there must be something that will stop it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Transform it back to electric field before it gets a chance\r\nto close in, then repeat the process--the way light does.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't make such a good magnetic shield. Every time that field\r\nstarted pulsing out through the walls of the ship it would generate\r\nheat. We want a permanent field that will stay on the job out there. I\r\nwonder if you couldn't make a conductor device that would open that\r\nfield out--some special type of oscillating field that would keep it\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-m-m-m--that's an angle I might try. Any suggestions?\"\r\n\r\nKendall had suggestions, and rapidly he outlined a development that\r\nappeared from some of the earlier mathematics on light, and might be\r\nwhat they wanted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKendall, however, had problems of his own to work on. The question of\r\natomic energy he was leaving alone, till the present experiment either\r\nsucceeded, or, as he rather suspected, failed as had its predecessors.\r\nHis present problem was to develop more fully some interesting lines of\r\nresearch he had run across in investigating mathematically the trick of\r\nturning electric to magnetic fields and then turning them back again. It\r\nmight be that along this line he would find the answer to the speed\r\ngreater than that of light. At any rate, he was interested.\r\n\r\nHe worked the rest of that day, and most of the next on that line--till\r\nhe ran it into the ground with a pair of equations that ended with the\r\nexpression: dx.dv=h/(4[pi]m). Then Kendall looked at them for a long\r\nmoment, then he sighed gently and threw them into a file cabinet.\r\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty. He'd reduced the thing to a form that simply\r\ntold him it was beyond the limits of certainty and he ran it into the\r\nnormal, natural uncertainty inevitable in Nature.\r\n\r\nAnyway he had real work to do now. The machine was about ready for his\r\nattention. The mechanicians had finished putting it in shape for\r\ndemonstration and trial. He himself would have to test it over the rest\r\nof the afternoon and arrange for power and so forth.\r\n\r\nBy evening, when Commander McLaurin called around with some of the other\r\ninvestors in Kendall's \"bank\" on Luna, the thing was already started,\r\nwarming up. The fields were being fed and the various scientists of the\r\ngroup were watching with interest. Power was flowing in already at a\r\nrate of nearly one hundred thousand horsepower per minute, thanks to a\r\nspecial line given them by New York Power (a Kendall property). At ten\r\no'clock they were beginning to expect the reaction to start. By this\r\ntime the fields weren't gaining in intensity very rapidly, a maximum\r\nintensity had been reached that should, they felt, break the atoms soon.\r\n\r\nAt eleven-thirty, through the little view window, Buck Kendall saw\r\nsomething that made him cry out in amazement. The mercury metal in the\r\nreceiver, behind its layers of screening was beginning to glow, with a\r\ndull reddish light, and little solidifications were appearing in it!\r\nEagerly the men looked, as the solidifications spread slowly, like\r\ncrystals growing in an evaporating solution.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock came and went, and one o'clock and two o'clock. Still the\r\nslow crystallization went on. Buck Kendall was casting furtive glances\r\nat the kilowatt-hour meter. It stood at a figure that represented\r\ntwenty-seven thousand dollars' worth of power. Long since the power rate\r\nhad been increased to the maximum available, as the power plant's normal\r\nload reduced as the morning hours came. Surely, this time something\r\nwould start, but Buck had two worries. If all the enormous amount of\r\nenergy they had poured in there decided to release itself at once--\r\n\r\nAnd at any rate, Buck saw they'd never dare to let a generator stop,\r\nonce it was started!\r\n\r\nThe men were a tense group around the machine at three-fifteen A.M.\r\nThere remained only a tiny, dancing globule of silvery mercury\r\nskittering around on the sharp, needle-like crystals of the dull red\r\nmetal that had resulted. Slowly that skittering drop was shrinking--\r\n\r\nThree twenty-two and a half A.M. saw the last fraction of it vanish.\r\nTensely the men stared into the machine--backing off slowly--watching\r\nthe meters on the board. At nearly eighty thousand volts the power had\r\nbeen fed into it.\r\n\r\nThe power continued to flow, and a growing halo of intense violet light\r\nappeared suddenly on those red, needle-like crystals, a swiftly\r\nexpanding halo--\r\n\r\nWithout a sound, without the slightest disturbance, the halo vanished,\r\nand softly, gently, the needle-like crystals relapsed, melted away, and\r\na dull pool of metallic mercury rested in the receiver.\r\n\r\nAt eighty thousand volts, power was flowing in--\r\n\r\nAnd it didn't even sparkle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of the magnetic shield had been completed two days later,\r\nand set up in Buck's own laboratory. On the bench was the powerful, but\r\nsmall, little projector of the straight magnetic field, simply a\r\nspecially designed accumulator, a super-condenser, and the peculiar\r\napparatus Devin had designed to distort the electric field through\r\nninety degrees to a magnetic field. Behind this was a curious,\r\nparaboloid projector made up of hundreds of tiny, carefully orientated\r\ncoils. This was Buck's own contribution. They were ready for the tests.\r\n\r\n\"I would invite McLaurin in to see this,\" said Kendall looking at them,\r\nand then across the room bitterly toward the alleged atomic power\r\napparatus on the opposite bench. \"I think it will work. But after\r\n_that_--\" He stared, glaring, at the heavy tungsten dome with its heavy\r\ntungsten contacts, across which the flame of released atomic energy was\r\nsupposed to have leapt. \"That was probably the flattest flop any\r\nexperiment ever flopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--it didn't blow up. That's one comfort,\" suggested Devin.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it had. Then at least it would have shown some response. The\r\nonly response shown, actually, was shown on the power meter. It damn\r\nnear wore out the bearings turning so fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I prefer the lack of action.\" Devin laughed. \"Have you got\r\nthat circuit hooked up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" sighed Kendall, turning back to the work in hand. \"Is Douglass\r\nin on this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--in the next room. He'll let us know when he's ready. He's setting\r\nup those instruments.\"\r\n\r\nDouglass, a young junior physicist, late of the IP Physics Department,\r\nstuck his head in the door and announced his instruments were all set\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Keep an eye on them. They'll move somehow, at any rate. This thing\r\ncouldn't go as flat as that atom-buster of mine.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully Kendall made a few last-minute adjustments on the limiting\r\nrelays, and took up his position at the power board. Devin took his\r\nplace near the apparatus, with another series of instruments, similar to\r\nthose Douglass was now watching in the next room, some thirty feet away,\r\nthrough the two-inch metal wall. \"Ready,\" called Kendall.\r\n\r\nThe switch shot home. Instantly Kendall, Devin, and all the men in the\r\nbuilding jumped some six feet from their former positions. A monstrous\r\nroar of sound crashed out in that laboratory that thundered from one\r\nwall to the other, and bellowed in a Titan's fury. It thundered and\r\ngrowled, it bellowed and howled, the walls shook with the march and\r\ncounter-march of crashing waves of sound.\r\n\r\nAnd a ten-foot wavering flame of blue-white, bellying electric fire\r\nshuddered up to the ceiling from the contact points of the alleged\r\natomic generator. The heat, pouring out from the flashing, roaring arc\r\nsent prickles of aching burns over Kendall's skin. For ten seconds he\r\nstood in utter, paralyzed surprise as his flop of flops bellowed its\r\nanger at his disdain. Then he leapt to the power board and shut off the\r\nroaring thing, by cutting the switch that had started it.\r\n\r\n\"Spirits of Space! Did _that_ come to life!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Atomic Energy!_\" Devin cried.\r\n\r\n\"Atomic energy, hell. That's my thirty thousand dollars' worth of power\r\nbreaking loose again,\" chortled Kendall. \"We missed the atomic energy,\r\nbut, sweet boy, what an accumulator we stubbed our toes on! I wondered\r\nwhere in blazes all that power went to. That's the answer. I'll bet I\r\ncan tell you right now what happened. We built that mercury up to a new\r\nlevel, and that transitional stage was the red, crystalline metal. When\r\nit reached the higher stage, it was temporarily stable--but that\r\nprojector over there that we designed for the purpose of holding open\r\nelectric and magnetic fields just opened the door and let all that power\r\nright out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why isn't it atomic energy? How do you know that no more than your\r\npower that you put in is coming out?\" demanded Devin.\r\n\r\n\"The arc, man, the arc. That was a high-current, and low-voltage arc.\r\nCouldn't you tell by the sound that no great voltage--as atomic voltages\r\ngo--was smashing across there? If we were getting atomic voltage--and\r\npower--there'd have been a different tone to it, high and shriller.\r\n\r\n\"Now, did you take any readings?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, man? I'm human. Do you think I got any readings with\r\nthat thing bellowing and shrieking in my ears, and burning my skin with\r\nultra-violet? It itches now.\"\r\n\r\nKendall laughed. \"You know what to do for an itch. Now, I'm going to\r\nmake a bet. We had those points separated for a half-million volts\r\ndischarge, but there was a dust-cover thrown over them just now. That,\r\nyou notice, is missing. I'll bet that served as a starter lead for the\r\nmain arc. Now I'm going to start that projector thing again, and move\r\nthe points there through about six inches, and that thing probably won't\r\nstart itself.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of the laboratory staff had collected at the doorway, looking in at\r\nthe white-hot tungsten discharge points, and the now silent \"atomic\r\nengine.\" Kendall turned to them and said: \"The flop picked itself up.\r\nYou go on back, we seem to be all in one piece yet. Douglass, you didn't\r\nget any readings, did you?\"\r\n\r\nSheepishly, Douglass grinned at him. \"Eh--er--no--but I tore my pants.\r\nThe magnetic field grabbed me and I jumped. They had some steel buttons,\r\nand a lot of steel keys--they're kinda' hard to keep on now.\"\r\n\r\nThe laboratory staff broke into a roar of laughter, as Douglass, holding\r\nup his trousers with both hands was beheld.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the field worked,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I guess maybe it did,\" adjudged Kendall solemnly. \"We have some rope\r\nhere if you need it--\"\r\n\r\nDouglass returned to his post.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, Kendall altered the atomic distortion storage apparatus, and\r\nreturned to the power-board. \"Ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Check.\"\r\n\r\nKendall shoved home the switch. The storage device was silent. Only a\r\nslight feeling of strain made itself felt, and the sudden noisy hum of a\r\nsmall transformer nearby. \"She works, Buck!\" Devin called. \"The readings\r\ncheck almost exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"All good then. Now I want to get to that atomic thing. We can let that\r\nslide for a little bit--I'll answer it.\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone had rung noisily. \"Kendall Labs--Kendall speaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Superintendent Foster, of the New York Power, Mr. Kendall. We\r\nhave some trouble just now that we think your operations may be\r\nresponsible for. The sub-station at North Beaumont blew all the fuses,\r\nand threw the breakers at the main station. The men out there said the\r\ntransformers began howling--\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are--I'm afraid I did do that. I had no idea that it would\r\nreach so far. How far is that from my place here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about a thousand yards, according to the survey maps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks--and I'll be careful about it. Any damage, I am responsible for?\r\nAll okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Kendall.\"\r\n\r\nKendall hung up. \"We stirred up a lot more dust\r\nthan we expected, Devin. Now let's start seeing if we can keep track of\r\nit. Douglass, how did your readings show?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took them at the ten stations, and here they are. The stations are\r\ntwo feet apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-m-m--.5--.55--.6--.7--20--198--5950--6010--6012--5920. Very, very\r\nnice--only the darned thing's got an arm as long as the law. Your\r\nreadings were about .2, Devin?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then these little readings are just leakage. What's our normal\r\nintensity here?\"\r\n\r\n\"About .19. Just a very small fraction less than the readings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect--we have what amounts to a hollow shell of magnetic force--we\r\ncan move inside, and you can move outside--far enough. But you can't get\r\na conductor or a magnetic field through it.\" He put the readings on the\r\nbench, and looked at the apparatus across the room. \"Now I want to start\r\nright on that other. Douglass, you move that magnetostat apparatus out\r\nof the way, and leave just the 'can-opener' of ours--the projector. I'm\r\npretty sure that's what does the deed. Devin, see if you can hunt up\r\nsome electrostatic voltmeters with a range in the neighborhood of--I\r\nthink it'll be about eighty thousand.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRapidly, Douglass was dismounting the apparatus, as Devin started for\r\nthe stock room. Kendall started making some new connections,\r\nreconnecting the apparatus they had intended using on the \"atomic\r\nengine,\" largely high-capacity resistances. He seemed to perform this\r\nwork mechanically, his mind definitely on something else. Suddenly he\r\nstopped, and looked carefully into the receiver of the machine. The\r\nmetal in it was silvery, liquid, and here and there a floating crystal\r\nof the dull red metal. Slowly a smile spread across his face. He turned\r\nto Douglass.\r\n\r\n\"Douglass--ah, you're through. Get on the trail of MacBride, and get him\r\nand his crew to work making half a dozen smaller things like this. Tell\r\n'em they can leave off the tungsten shield. I want different metals in\r\nthe receiver of each. Use--hmmm--sodium--copper--magnesium--aluminium,\r\niron and chromium. Got it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" He left, just as Devin returned with a large electrostatic\r\nvoltmeter.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like,\" said he, \"to know how you know the voltage will range around\r\neighty thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"K-ring excitation potential for mercury. I'm willing to bet that thing\r\nsimply shoved the whole electron system of the mercury out a notch--that\r\nit simply _hasn't_ any K-ring of electrons now. I'm trying some other\r\nmetals. Douglass is going to have MacBride make up half a dozen more\r\nmachines. Machines--they need a name. This--ah--this is an 'atostor.'\r\nMacBride's going to make up half a dozen of 'em, and try half a dozen\r\nmetals. I'm almost certain that's not mercury in there now, at all. It's\r\nprobably element 99 or something like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like mercury--\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. So would 99. Following the periodic table, 99 would probably\r\nhave an even lower melting point than mercury, be silvery, dense and\r\nheavy--and perhaps slightly radioactive. The series under the B family\r\nof Group II is Magnesium, Zinc, Cadmium, Mercury--and 99. The melting\r\npoint is going down all the way, and they're all silvery metals. I'm\r\ngoing to try copper, and I fully expect it to turn silvery--in fact, to\r\nbecome silver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's see.\" Swiftly they hooked up the apparatus, realigned the\r\nprojector, and again Kendall took his place at the power-board. As he\r\nclosed the switch, on no-load, the electrostatic voltmeter flopped over\r\ninstantly, and steadied at just over 80,000 volts.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to say 'I told you so,'\" said Kendall. \"But let's hook in a\r\nload. Try it on about 100 amps first.\"\r\n\r\nDevin began cutting in load. The resistors began heating up swiftly as\r\nmore and more current flowed through them. By not so much as by a\r\nvibration of the voltmeter needle, did the apparatus betray any strain\r\nas the load mounted swiftly. 100--200--500--1000 amperes. Still, that\r\nneedle held steady. Finally, with a drain of ten thousand amperes, all\r\nthe equipment available could handle, the needle was steady as a rock,\r\nthough the tremendous load of 800,000,000 watts was cut in and out.\r\nThat, to atoms, atoms by the nonillions, was no appreciable load at all.\r\nThere was _no_ internal resistance whatever. The perfect accumulator\r\nhad certainly been discovered.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to call McLaurin--\" Kendall hurried away with a broad, broad\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Tom?\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone rattled in a peeved sort of way. \"Yes, it is. What now?\r\nAnd when am I going to see you in a social sort of way again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a long, long time; I'm busy. I'm busy right now as a matter of\r\nfact. I'm calling up the vice-president of Faragaut Interplanetary\r\nLines, and I want to place an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why bother me? We have clerks, you know, for that sort of thing,\"\r\nsuggested Faragaut in a pained voice.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, do you know how much I'm worth now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" replied Faragaut promptly. \"What of it? I hear, as a matter\r\nof fact that you're worth even less in a business way. They're talking\r\nquite a lot down this way about an alleged bank you're setting up on\r\nLuna. I hear it's got more protective devices, and armor than any IP\r\nstation in the System, that you even had it designed by an IP designer,\r\nand have a gang of Colonels and Generals in charge. I also hear that\r\nyou've succeeded in getting rid of money at about one million dollars a\r\nday--just slightly shy of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You overestimate me, my friend. Much of that is merely contracted for.\r\nActually it'll take me nearly nine months to get rid of it. And by that\r\ntime I'll have more. Anyway, I think I have something like ten million\r\nleft. And remember that way back in the twentieth century some old\r\nfellow beat my record. Armour, I think it was, lost a million dollars a\r\nday for a couple of months running.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, what I called you up for was to say I'd like to order five\r\nhundred thousand tons of mercury, for delivery as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Oh, say, I thought you were going in for business.\" Faragaut gave\r\na slight laugh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, I am. I mean exactly what I say. I want\r\nfive--hundred--thousand--_tons_ of metallic mercury, and just as soon as\r\nyou can get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, there isn't that much in the system.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it. Get all there is on the market for me, and contract to take\r\nall the 'Jupiter Heavy-Metals' can turn out. You send those orders\r\nthrough, and clean out the market completely. Somebody's about to pay\r\nfor the work I've been doing, and boy, they're going to pay through the\r\nnose. After you've got that order launched, and don't make a christening\r\nparty of the launching either, why just drop out here, and I'll show you\r\nwhy the value of mercury is going so high you won't be able to follow it\r\nin a space ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cost of that,\" said Faragaut, seriously now, \"will be\r\nabout--fifty-three million at the market price. You'd have to put up\r\ntwenty-six cash, and I don't believe you've got it.\"\r\n\r\nBuck laughed. \"Tom, loan me a dozen million, will you? You send that\r\norder through, and then come see what I've got. I've got a break, too!\r\nMercury's the best metal for this use--and it'll stop gamma rays too!\"\r\n\r\n\"So it will--but for the love of the system, what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and see--tonight. Will you send that order through?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Buck. I hope you're right. Cash is tight now, and I'll probably\r\nhave to put up nearer twenty million, when all that buying goes through.\r\nHow long will it be tied up in that deal, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not over three weeks. And I'll guarantee you three hundred percent--if\r\nyou'll stay in with me after you start. Otherwise--I don't think making\r\nthis money would be fair just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be out to see you in about two hours, Buck. Where are you? At the\r\nestate?\" asked Faragaut seriously.\r\n\r\n\"In my lab out there. Thanks, Tom.\"\r\n\r\nMcLaurin was there when Tom Faragaut arrived. And General Logan, and\r\nColonel Gerardhi. There was a restrained air of gratefulness about all\r\nof them that Tom Faragaut couldn't quite understand. He had been looking\r\nup Buck Kendall's famous bank, and more and more he had begun to wonder\r\njust what was up. The list of stockholders had read like a list of IP\r\nheroes and executives. The staff had been a list of IP men with a\r\nslender sprinkling of accountants. And the sixty-million dollar\r\nstructure was to be a bank without advertising of any sort! Usually such\r\na venture is planned and published months in advance. This had sprung up\r\nsuddenly, with a strange quietness.\r\n\r\nAlmost silently, Buck Kendall led the way to the laboratory. A small\r\nmetal tank was supported in a peculiar piece of apparatus, and from it\r\nled a small platinum pipe to a domed apparatus made largely of insulum.\r\nA little pool of mercury, with small red crystals floating in it rested\r\nin a shallow hollow surrounded by heavy conductors.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, Tom. I wanted to show you first what we have, and why I\r\nwanted all that mercury. Within three weeks, every man, woman and child\r\nin the system will be clamoring for mercury metal. That's the perfect\r\naccumulator.\" Quickly he demonstrated the machine, charging it, and then\r\ndischarging it. It was better than 99.95% efficient on the charge, and\r\nwas 100% efficient on the discharge.\r\n\r\n\"Physically, any metal will do. Technically, mercury is best for a\r\nnumber of reasons. It's a liquid. I can, and do it in this, charge a\r\ncertain quantity, and then move it up to the storage tank. Charge\r\nanother pool, and move it up. In discharge, I can let a stream flow in\r\ncontinuously if I required a steady, terrific drain of power without\r\ninterruption. If I wanted it for more normal service, I'd discharge a\r\npool, drain it, refill the receiver, and discharge a second pool. Thus,\r\nmercury is the metal to use.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see why I wanted all that metal?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, Buck--Lord, I do,\" gasped Faragaut. \"That is the perfect power\r\nsupply.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, confound it, it isn't. It's a secondary source. It isn't primary.\r\nWe're just as limited in the _supply_ of power as ever--only we have\r\nincreased our distribution of power. Lord knows, we're going to need a\r\npower _supply_ badly enough before long--\" Buck relapsed into moody\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" asked Faragaut, looking around him, \"does that mean?\"\r\n\r\nIt was McLaurin who told him of the stranger ship, and Kendall's\r\ninterpretation of its meaning. Slowly Faragaut grasped the meaning\r\nbehind Buck's strange actions of the past months.\r\n\r\n\"The Lunar Bank,\" he said slowly, half to himself. \"Staffed by trained\r\nIP men, experts in expert destruction. Buck, you said something about\r\nthe profits of this venture. What did you mean?\"\r\n\r\nBuck smiled. \"We're going to stick up IP to the extent necessary to pay\r\nfor that fort--er--bank--on Luna. We'll also boost the price so that\r\nwe'll make enough to pay for those ships I'm having made. The public\r\nwill pay for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. And we aren't to stick the price too high, and just make money?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the general idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The IP Appropriations Board won't give you what you need, Commander,\r\nfor real improvements on the IP ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't believe Kendall. Therefore they won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean about gamma rays, Buck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercury will stop them and the Commander here intends to have the\r\nrefitted ships built so that the engine room and control room are one,\r\nand completely surrounded by the mercury tanks. The men will be\r\nprotected against the gamma rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't the rays affect the power stored in the mercury--perhaps release\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"We tried it out, of course, and while we can't get the intensities we\r\nexpect, and can't really make any measurements of the gamma-ray energy\r\nimpinging on the mercury--it seems to absorb, and store that energy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's next on the program, Buck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish those ships I have building. And I want to do some more\r\ndevelopment work. The Stranger will return within six months now, I\r\nbelieve. It will take all that time, and more for real refitting of the\r\nIP ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about more forts--or banks, whichever you want to call them. Mars\r\nisn't protected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mars is abandoned,\" replied General Logan seriously. \"We haven't any\r\ntoo much to protect old Earth, and she must come first. Mars will, of\r\ncourse, be protected as best the IP ships can. But--we're expecting\r\ndefeat. This isn't a case of glorious victory. It will be a case of hard\r\nwon survival. We don't know anything about the enemy--except that they\r\nare capable of interstellar flights, and have atomic energy. They are\r\nevidently far ahead of us. Our battle is to survive till we learn how to\r\nconquer. For a time, at least, the Strangers will have possession of\r\nmost of the planets of the system. We do not think they will be able to\r\nreach Earth, because Commander McLaurin here will withdraw his ships to\r\nEarth to protect the planet--and the great 'Lunar Bank' will display its\r\ntrue character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFaragaut looked unsympathetically at Buck Kendall, as he stood glaring\r\nperplexedly at the apparatus he had been working on.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Buck, won't she perk?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, damn it, and it should.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" pointed out Faragaut, \"is just what you think. Nature thinks\r\notherwise. We generally have to abide by her opinions. What is it--or\r\nwhat is it meant to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect reflector.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a nice mirror. What else, and how come?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mirror is just what I want. I want something that will reflect _all_\r\nthe radiation that falls on it. No metal will, even in its range of\r\nmaximum reflectivity. Aluminum goes pretty high, silver, on some ranges,\r\na bit higher. But none of them reaches 99%. I want a perfect reflector\r\nthat I can put behind a source of wild, radiant energy so I can focus\r\nit, and put it where it will do the most good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ninety-nine percent. Sounds pretty good. That's better efficiency than\r\nmost anything else we have, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't. The accumulator is 100% efficient on the discharge, and a\r\ngood transformer, even before that, ran as high as 99.8 sometimes. They\r\nhad to. If you have a transformer handling 1,000,000 horsepower, and\r\nit's even 1% inefficient, you have a heat loss of nearly 10,000\r\nhorsepower to handle. I want to use this as a destructive weapon, and if\r\nI hand the other fellow energy in distressing amounts, it's even worse\r\nat my end, because no matter how perfect a beam I work out, there will\r\nstill be some spread. I can make it mighty tight though, if I make my\r\nsurface a perfect parabola. But if I send a million horse, I have to\r\nhandle it, and a ship can't stand several hundred thousand horsepower\r\nroaming around loose as heat, let alone the weapon itself. The thing\r\nwill be worse to me than to him.\r\n\r\n\"I figured there was something worth investigating in those fields we\r\ndeveloped on our magnetic shield work. They had to do, you know, with\r\nlight, and radiant energy. There must be some reason why a metal\r\nreflects. Further, though we can't get down to the basic root of matter,\r\nthe atom, yet, we can play around just about as we please with molecules\r\nand molecular forces. But it is molecular force that determines whether\r\nlight and radiant energy of that caliber shall be reflected or\r\ntransmitted. Take aluminum as an example. In the metallic molecule\r\nstate, the metal will reflect pretty well. But volatilize it, and it\r\nbecomes transparent. All gases are transparent, all metals reflective.\r\nThen the secret of perfect reflection lies at a molecular level in the\r\norganization of matter, and is within our reach. Well--this thing was\r\nsupposed to make that piece of silver reflective. I missed it that\r\ntime.\" He sighed. \"I suppose I'll have to try again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you'd use tungsten for that. If you do have a slight\r\nleak, that would handle the heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it would hold it. Silver is a better conductor of heat. But the\r\ndarned thing won't work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your other scheme has.\" Faragaut laughed. \"I came out principally for\r\nsome signatures. IP wants one hundred thousand tons of mercury. I've\r\nsold most of mine already in the open market. You want to sell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And I told you my price.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" sighed Faragaut. \"It seems a shame though. Those IP board men\r\nwould pay higher. And they're so damn tight it seems a crime not to make\r\n'em pay up when they have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"The IP will need the money worse elsewhere. Where do I--oh, here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. I'll be out again this evening. The regular group will be here?\"\r\n\r\nKendall nodded as he signed in triplicate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening, Buck had found the trouble in his apparatus, for as he\r\nwell knew, the theory was right, only the practical apparatus needed\r\nchanging. Before the group composed of Faragaut, McLaurin and the\r\nmembers of Kendall's \"bank,\" he demonstrated it.\r\n\r\nIt was merely a small, model apparatus, with a mirror of space-strained\r\nsilver that was an absolutely perfect reflector. The mirror had been\r\nground out of a block of silver one foot deep, by four inches square,\r\ncarefully annealed, and the work had all been done in a cooling bath.\r\nThe result was a mirror that was so nearly a perfect paraboloid that the\r\nbeam held sharp and absolutely tight for the half-mile range they tested\r\nit on. At the projector it was three and one-half inches in diameter. At\r\nthe target, it was three and fifty-two one hundredths inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got the mirror, what are you going to reflect with it\r\nnow?\" asked McLaurin. \"The greatest problem is getting a radiant source,\r\nisn't it? You can't get a temperature above about ten thousand degrees,\r\nand maintain it very long, can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Kendall smiled.\r\n\r\n\"It'll volatilize and leave the scene of action, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if it's a gaseous source already?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Just a gas-flame? That won't give you the point source you need.\r\nYou're using just a spotlight here, with a Moregan Point-light. That\r\nwon't give you energy, and if you use a gas-flame, the spread will be so\r\ngreat, that no matter how perfectly you figure your mirror, it won't\r\nbeam.\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer is easy. Not an ordinary gas-flame--a very extra-special\r\nkind of gas-flame. Know anything about Renwright's ionization-work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Renwright--he's an IP man isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. He's developed a system, which, thanks to the power we can get\r\nin that atostor, will sextuply ionize oxygen gas. Now: what does that\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spirits of space! Concentrated essence of energy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. And in preparation, Cole here had one made up for me. That--and\r\nsomething else. We'll just hook it up--\"\r\n\r\nWith Devin's aid, Kendall attached the second apparatus, a larger device\r\ninto which the silver block with its mirror surface fitted. With the\r\nuttermost care, the two physicists lined it up. Two projectors pointed\r\ntoward each other at an angle, the base angles of a triangle, whose apex\r\nwas the center of the mirror. On very low power, a soft, glowing violet\r\nlight filtered out through the opening of the one, and a slight green\r\nlight came from the other. But where the two streams met, an intense,\r\nviolet glare built up. The center of action was not at the focus, and\r\nslowly this was lined up, till a sharp, violet beam of light reached out\r\nacross the open yard to the target set up.\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall cut off the power, and slowly got into position. \"Now. Keep\r\nout from in front of that thing. Put on these glasses--and watch out.\"\r\nHeavy, thick-lensed orange-brown goggles were passed out, and Kendall\r\ntook his place. Before him, a thick window of the same glass had been\r\narranged, so that he might see uninterruptedly the controls at hand, and\r\nyet watch unblinded, the action of the beam.\r\n\r\nDully the mirror-force relay clicked. A hazy glow ran over the silver\r\nblock, and died. Then--simultaneously the power was thrown from two\r\nsmall, compact atostors into the twin projectors. Instantly--a titanic\r\neruption of light almost invisibly violet, spurted out in a solid,\r\ncompact stream. With a roar and crash, it battered its way through the\r\nthick air, and crashed into the heavy target plate. A stream of flame\r\nand scintillating sparks erupted from the armor plate--and died as\r\nKendall cut the beam. A white-hot area a foot across leaked down the\r\nface of the metal.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Faragaut gently, removing his goggles. \"That's not a\r\nspotlight, and it's not exactly a gas-flame. But I still don't know what\r\nthat blue-hot needle of destruction is. Just what do you call that tame\r\nstellar furnace of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so far off, Tom,\" said Kendall happily, \"except that even S Doradus\r\nis cold compared to that. That sends almost pure ultra-violet\r\nlight--which, by the way, it is almost impossible to reflect\r\nsuccessfully, and represents a temperature to be expressed not in\r\nthousands of degrees, nor yet in tens of thousands. I calculated the\r\ntemperature would be about 750,000 degrees. What is happening is that a\r\nstream of low-voltage electrons--cathode rays--in great quantity are\r\nmeeting great quantities of sextuply ionized oxygen. That means that a\r\nnucleus used to having two electrons in the K-ring, and six in the next,\r\nhas had that outer six knocked off, and then has been hurled violently\r\ninto free air.\r\n\r\n\"All by themselves, those sextuply ionized oxygen atoms would have a\r\ngood bit to say, but they don't really begin to talk till they start\r\nroaring for those electrons I'm feeding them. At the meeting point, they\r\ngrab up all they can get--probably about five--before the competition\r\nand the fierce release of energy drives them out, part-satisfied. I lose\r\na little energy there, but not a real fraction. It's the howl they put\r\nup for the first four that counts. The electron-feed is necessary,\r\nbecause otherwise they'd smash on and ruin that mirror. They work\r\npractically in a perfect vacuum. That beam smashes the air out of the\r\nway. Of course, in space it would work better.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could it?\" asked Faragaut, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Kendall,\" asked McLaurin, \"can we install that in the IP ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can start.\" Kendall shrugged. \"There isn't a lot of apparatus. I'm\r\ngoing to install them in my ships, and in the--bank. I suspect--we\r\nhaven't a lot of time left.\"\r\n\r\n\"How near ready are those ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"About. That's all I can say. They've been torn up a bit for\r\ninstallation of the atostor apparatus. Now they'll have to be changed\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything more coming?\"\r\n\r\nBuck smiled slowly. He turned directly to McLaurin and replied:\r\n\"Yes--the Strangers. As to developments--I can't tell, naturally. But if\r\nthey do, it will be something entirely unexpected now. You see, given\r\none new discovery, a half-dozen will follow immediately from it. When we\r\nannounced that atostor, look what happened. Renwright must have thought\r\nit was God's gift to suffering physicists. He stuck some oxygen in the\r\nthing, added some of his own stuff--and behold. The magnetic apparatus\r\ngave us directly the shield, and indirectly this mirror. Now, I seem to\r\nhave reached the end for the time. I'm still trying to get that\r\nspace-release for high speed--speed greater than light, that is. So\r\nfar,\" he added bitterly, \"all I've gotten as an answer is a single\r\nexpression that simply means practical zero--Heisenberg's Uncertainty\r\nExpression.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm uncertain as to your meaning\"--McLaurin smiled--\"but I take it\r\nthat's nothing new.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Nearly four centuries old--twentieth century physics. I'll have to\r\ntry some other line of attack, I guess, but that did seem so darned\r\nright. It just sounded right. Something ought to happen--and it just\r\nkeeps saying 'nothing more except the natural uncertainty of nature.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Try it out, your math might be wrong somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nKendall laughed. \"If it was--I'd hate to try it out. If it wasn't I'd\r\nhave no reason to. And there's plenty of other work to do. For one\r\nthing, getting that apparatus in production. The IP board won't like\r\nme.\" Kendall smiled.\r\n\r\n\"They don't,\" replied McLaurin. \"They're getting more and more and more\r\nworried--but they've got to keep the IP fleet in such condition that it\r\ncan at least catch an up-to-date freighter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae looked back at Sthor rapidly dropping behind, and across at\r\nher sister world, Asthor, circling a bare 100,000 miles away. Behind his\r\ngreat interstellar cruiser came a long line of similar ships. Each was\r\nloaded now not with instruments and pure scientists, but with weapons,\r\nfuel and warriors. Colonists too, came in the last ships. One hundred\r\nand fifty giant ships. All the wealth of Sthor and Asthor had been\r\nconcentrated in producing those great machines. Every one represented\r\nnearly the equivalent of thirty million Earth-dollars. Four and a half\r\nbillions of dollars for mere materials.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae had the honor of lead position, for he had discovered the\r\nplanets and their stable, though tiny, sun. Still, Gresth Gkae knew his\r\nown giant Mira was a super-giant sun--and a curse and a menace to any\r\nrational society. Our yellow-white sun (to his eyes, an almost invisible\r\ncolor, similar to our blue) was small, but stable, and warm enough.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour, all the ships were in space, and at a given signal, at\r\nten-second intervals, they sprang into the superspeed, faster than\r\nlight. For an instant, giant Mira ran and seemed distorted, as though\r\nseen through a porthole covered with running water, then steadied,\r\ncuriously distorted. Faster than light they raced across the galaxy.\r\n\r\nEven in their super-fast ships, nearly three and a half weeks passed\r\nbefore the sun they sought, singled itself from the star-field as an\r\nextra bright point. Two days more, and the sun was within planetary\r\ndistance. They came at an angle to the plane of the ecliptic, but they\r\nleveled down to it now, and slanted toward giant Jupiter and Jovian\r\nworlds. Ten worlds, in one sweep, it was--four habitable worlds. The\r\nnine satellites would be converted into forts at once, nine\r\nspace-sweeping forts guarding the approaches to the planet. Gresth Gkae\r\nhad made a fairly good search of the worlds, and knew that Earth was the\r\nmain home of civilization in this system. Mars was second, and Venus\r\nthird. But Jupiter offered the greatest possibilities for quick\r\nsettlement, a base from which they could more easily operate, a base for\r\nfuels, for the heavy elements they would need--\r\n\r\nFifteen million miles from Jupiter they slowed below the speed of\r\nlight--and the IP stations observed them. Instantly, according to\r\ninstructions issued by Commander McLaurin, a fleet of ten of the\r\ntiniest, fastest scouts darted out. As soon as possible, a group of\r\nthree heavy cruisers, armed with all the inventions that had been\r\ndiscovered, the atostor power system, perfectly conducting power leads,\r\nthe terrible UV ray, started out.\r\n\r\nThe scouts got there first. Cameras were grinding steadily, with long\r\nrange telescopic lenses, delicate instruments probed and felt and caught\r\ntheir fingers in the fields of the giant fleet.\r\n\r\nAt ten-second intervals, giant ships popped into being, and glided\r\nsmoothly toward Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThen the cruisers arrived. They halted at a respectful distance, and\r\nwaited. The Miran ships plowed on undisturbed. Simultaneously, from the\r\nthree leaders, terrific neutron rays shot out. The paraffin block walls\r\nstopped those--and the cruisers started to explain their feelings on the\r\nsubject. They were the IP-J-37, 39, and 42. The 37 turned up the full\r\npower of the UV ray. The terrific beam of ultra-violet energy struck the\r\nsecond Miran ship, and the spot it touched exploded into incandescence,\r\nburned white-hot--and puffed out abruptly as the air pressure within\r\nblew the molten metal away.\r\n\r\nThe Mirans were startled. This was not the type of thing Gresth Gkae had\r\nwarned them of. Gresth Gkae himself frowned as the sudden roar of the\r\nmachines of his ship rose in the metal walls. A stream of ten-inch\r\natomic bombs shrieked out of their tubes, fully glowing green things\r\nfloated out more slowly, and immediately waxed brilliant. Gamma ray\r\nbombs--but they could be guarded against--\r\n\r\nThe three Solarian cruisers were washed in such frightful flame as they\r\nhad never imagined. Streams of atomic bombs were exploding soundlessly,\r\nineffectively in space, not thirty feet from them as they felt the\r\nsudden resistance of the magnetic shields. Hopefully, the 39 probed with\r\nher neutron gun. Nothing happened save that several gamma ray bombs went\r\noff explosively, and all the atomic bombs in its path exploded at once.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae knew what that meant. Neutron beam guns. Then this race was\r\nmore intelligent than he had believed. They had not had them before. Had\r\nhe perhaps given them too much warning and information?\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden, deeper note in the thrumming roar of the great\r\nship. Eagerly Gresth Gkae watched--and sighed in relief. The nearer of\r\nthe three enemy ships was crumbling to dust. Now the other two were\r\nbeginning to become blurred of outline. They were fleeing--but oh, so\r\nslowly. Easily the greater ship chased them down, till only floating\r\ndust, and a few small pieces of--\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae shrieked in pain, and horror. The destroyed ships had fought\r\nin dying. All space seemed to blossom out with a terrible light, a light\r\nthat wrapped around them, and burned into him, and through him. His eyes\r\nwere dark and burning lumps in his head, his flesh seemed crawling,\r\nstinging--he was being flayed alive--in shrieking agony he crumpled to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nHospital attaches came to him, and injected drugs. Slowly torturing\r\nconsciousness left him. The doctors began working over his horribly\r\nburned body, shuddering inwardly as the protective, feather-like\r\ncovering of his skin loosened, and dropped from his body. Tenderly they\r\nlowered him into a bath of chemicals--\r\n\r\n\"The terrible light which caused so much damage to our men,\" reported a\r\nphysicist, \"was analyzed, and found to have some extraordinary lines. It\r\nwas largely mercury-vapor spectrum, but the spectrum of mercury-atoms in\r\nan impossibly strained condition. I would suggest that great care be\r\nused hereafter, and all men be equipped with protective masks when\r\nobservations are needed. This sun is very rich in the infra-X-rays and\r\nultra-visible light. The explosion of light, we witnessed, was dangerous\r\nin its consisting almost wholly of very short and hard infra-X-rays.\"\r\n\r\nThe physicist had a special term for what we know as ultra-violet light.\r\nTo him, blue was ultra-violet, and exceedingly dangerous to\r\nred-sensitive eyes. To him, our ultra-violet was a long X-ray, and was\r\ndesignated by a special term. And to him--the explosion of the atostor\r\nreservoirs was a terrible and mystifying calamity.\r\n\r\nTo the men in the five tiny scout-ships, it was also a surprise, and a\r\npainful one. Even space-hardened humans were burned by the terrifically\r\nhard ultra-violet from the explosion. But they got some hint of what it\r\nhad meant to the Mirans from the confusion that resulted in the fleet.\r\nSeveral of the nearer ships spun, twisted, and went erratically off\r\ntheir courses. All seemed uncontrolled momentarily.\r\n\r\nThe five scouts, following orders, darted instantly toward the Lunar\r\nBank. Why, they did not know. But those were orders. They were to land\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that, faster than any Solarian ship, radio signals had\r\nreached McLaurin, and he, and most of the staff of the IP service had\r\nbeen moved to the Lunar Bank. Buck Kendall had extended an invitation in\r\nthis \"unexpected emergency.\" It so happened that Buck Kendall's\r\ninvitation got there before any description of the Strangers, or their\r\nactions had arrived. The staff was somewhat puzzled as to how this\r\nhappened--\r\n\r\nAnd now for the satellites of great Jupiter.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty giant interstellar cruisers advanced on Callisto.\r\nThey didn't pause to investigate the mines and scattered farms of the\r\nsatellite, but ten great ships settled, and a horde of warriors began\r\npouring out.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty ships reached Ganymede. One hundred and thirty\r\nsailed on. One hundred and thirty ships reached Europa--and they sailed\r\non hurriedly, one hundred and twenty-nine of them. Gresth Gkae did not\r\nknow it then, but the fleet had lost its first ship. The IP station on\r\nEuropa had spoken back.\r\n\r\nThey sailed in, a mighty armada, and the first dropped through Europa's\r\nthin, frozen atmosphere. They spotted the dome of the station, and a\r\nneutron ray lashed out at it. On the other, undefended worlds, this had\r\nbeen effective. Here--it was answered by ten five-foot UV rays. Further,\r\nthese men had learned something from the destruction of the cruisers,\r\nand ten torpedoes had been unloaded, reloaded with atostor mercury, and\r\nsent out bravely.\r\n\r\nEasily the Mirans wiped out the first torpedo--\r\n\r\nShrieking, the Miran pilots clawed their way from the controls as the\r\nfearful flood of ultra-violet light struck their unaccustomed skins.\r\nOthers too felt that burning flood.\r\n\r\nThe second torpedo they caught and deflected on a beam of\r\nalternating-current magnetism that repelled it. It did not come nearer\r\nthan half a mile to the ship. The third they turned their deflecting\r\nbeam on--and something went strangely wrong with the beam. It pulled\r\nthat torpedo toward the ship with a sickening acceleration--and the\r\ntorpedo exploded in that frightful violet flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive-foot diameter UV beams are nothing to play with. The Mirans were\r\ndodging these now as they loosed atomic bombs, only to see them exploded\r\nharmlessly by neutron guns, or caught in the magnetic screen. Gamma ray\r\nbombs were as useless. Again the beam of disintegrating force was turned\r\non--\r\n\r\nThe present opponent was not a ship. It was an IP defense station,\r\nequipped with everything Solarian science knew, and the dome was an\r\neight-foot wall of tungsten-beryllium. The eight feet of solid,\r\nultra-resistant alloy drank up that crumbling beam, and liked it. The\r\nwall did not fail. The men inside the fort jerked and quivered as the\r\nstrange beam, a small, small fraction of it, penetrated the eight feet\r\nof outer wall, the six feet or so of intervening walls, and the mercury\r\natostor reserves.\r\n\r\n\"Concentrate all those UV beams on one spot, and see if you can blast a\r\nhole in him before he shakes it loose,\" ordered the ray technician.\r\n\"He'll wiggle if you start off with the beam. Train your sights on the\r\nnose of that first ship--when you're ready, call out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready--ready--\" Ten men replied. \"Fire!\" roared the technician. Ten\r\ntitanic swords of pure ultra-violet energy, energy that practically no\r\nunconditioned metal will reflect to more than fifty per cent, emerged.\r\nThere was a single spot of intense incandescence for a single hundredth\r\nof a second--and then the energy was burning its way through the inner,\r\nthinner skins with such rapidity that they sputtered and flickered like\r\na broken televisor.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-nine ships retreated hastily for conference,\r\nleaving a gutted, wrecked hull, broken by its fall, on Europa.\r\nTriumphantly, the Europa IP station hurled out its radio message of the\r\nfirst encounter between a fort and the Miran forces.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, it sent a great deal of badly wanted information\r\nregarding the Miran weapons. Particularly interesting was the fact that\r\nit had withstood the impact of that disintegrating ray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGrimly Buck Kendall looked at the reports. McLaurin stood beside him,\r\nDevin sat across the table from him. \"What do you make of it, Buck?\"\r\nasked the Commander.\r\n\r\n\"That we have just one island of resistance left on the Jovian worlds.\r\nAnd that will, I fear, vanish. They haven't finished with their arsenal\r\nby any means.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was it, man, what was it that ruined those ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vibration. Somehow--Lord only knows how it's done--they can project\r\nelectric fields. These projected fields are oscillated, and they are\r\ntuned in with some parts of the ship. I suspect they are crystals of the\r\nmetals. If they can start a vibration in the crystals of the\r\nmetal--that's fatigue, metal fatigue enormously speeded. You know how a\r\nquartz crystal oscillator in a radio-control apparatus will break, if\r\nyou work it on a very heavy load at the peak? They simply smash the\r\ncrystals of metal in the same way. Only they project their field.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our toughest metals are useless? Can't something tough, rather\r\nthan hard, like copper or even silver for instance, stand it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Calcium metal's the toughest going--and even that would break under the\r\nbeating those ships give it. The only way to withstand it is to have\r\nsuch a mass of metal that the oscillations are damped out. But--\"\r\n\r\nThe set tuned in on the IP station on Europa was speaking again. \"The\r\nships are returning. There are one hundred and twenty-nine by accurate\r\ncount. Jorgsen reports that telescopic observation of the dead on the\r\nfallen cruiser show them to be a _completely un-human race_! They are\r\nof mottled coloring, predominately grayish brown. The ships are\r\nreturning. They have divided into ten groups, nine groups of two each,\r\nand a main body of the rest of the fleet. The group of eighteen is\r\ndescending within range, and we are focusing our beams on them--\"\r\n\r\nOut by Europa, ten great UV beams were stabbing angrily toward ten great\r\ninterstellar ships. The metal of the hulls glowed brilliant, and\r\ndistorted slowly as the thick walls softened under the heat, and the air\r\nbehind pressed against it. Grimly the ten ships came on. Torpedoes were\r\nbeing launched, and exploded, and now they had no effect, for the Mirans\r\nwithin were protected.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen grouped ships separated, and arranged themselves in a\r\ncircle around the fort. Suddenly one staggered as a great puff of gas\r\nshot out through the thin atmosphere of Europa to flare brilliantly in\r\nthe lash of the stabbing UV beam. Instantly the ship righted itself, and\r\nlabored upward. Another dropped to take its place--\r\n\r\nAnd the great walls of the IP fort suddenly groaned and started in their\r\nwelded joints. The faint, whispering rustle of the crumbling beam was\r\nmurmuring through the station. Engineers shouted suddenly as meters\r\nleapt the length of their scales, and the needles clicked softly on the\r\nstop pins. A thin rustle came from the atostors grouped in the great\r\npower room. \"Spirits of Space--a revolving magnetic field!\" roared the\r\nChief Technician. \"They're making this whole blasted station a squirrel\r\ncage!\"\r\n\r\nThe mighty walls of eight-foot metal shuddered and trembled. The UV\r\nbeams lashed out from the fort in quivering arcs now, they did not hold\r\ntheir aim steady, and the magnetic shield that protected them from\r\natomic bombs was working and straining wildly. Eighteen great ships\r\nquivered and tugged outside there now, straining with all their power to\r\nremain in the same spot, as they passed on from one to another the\r\nmagnetic impulses that were now creating a titanic magnetic vortex about\r\nthe fort.\r\n\r\n\"The atostors will be exhausted in another fifteen minutes,\" the Chief\r\nTechnician roared into his transmitter. \"Can the signals get through\r\nthose fields, Commander?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mac. They've been stopped, Sparks tells me. We're here--and let's\r\nhope we stay. What's happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"They've got a revolving magnetic field out there that would spin a\r\nminor planet. The whole blasted fort is acting like the squirrel cage in\r\nan induction motor! They've made us the armature in a five hundred\r\nmillion horsepower electric motor.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't tear this place loose, can they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--it was never--\" The Chief stopped. Outside a terrific\r\nroar and crash had built up. White darts of flame leapt a thousand feet\r\ninto the air, hurling terrific masses of shattered rock and soil.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to say,\" the Chief went on, \"this place wasn't designed for\r\nthat sort of a strain. Our own magnetic field is supporting us now,\r\npreventing their magnetic field from getting its teeth on metal. When\r\nthe strain comes--well, they're cutting loose our foundation with atomic\r\nbombs!\"\r\n\r\nFive UV beams were combined on one interstellar ship. Instantly the\r\ngreat machine retreated, and another dropped in to take its place while\r\nthe magnetic field spun on, uninterruptedly.\r\n\r\n\"Can they keep that up long?\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows--but they have a hundred and more ships to send in when the\r\npower of one gives out, remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's our reserve now?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief paused a moment to look at the meters. \"Half what it was ten\r\nminutes ago!\"\r\n\r\nCommander Wallace sent some other orders. Every torpedo tube of the\r\nstation suddenly belched forth deadly, fifteen-foot torpedoes, most of\r\nthem mud-torpedoes, torpedoes loaded with high explosive in the nose, a\r\ndelayed fuse, and a load of soft clinging mud in the rear. The mud would\r\nflow down over the nose and offer a resistance foot-hold for the\r\nexplosive which empty space would not. Four hundred and three torpedoes,\r\nequipped with anti-magnetic apparatus darted out. One hundred and four\r\npassed the struggling fields. One found lodgement on a Miran ship, and\r\ncrushed in a metal wall, to be stopped by a bulkhead.\r\n\r\nThe Chief engineer watched his power declining. All ten UV beams were\r\nunited in one now, driving a terrible sword of energy that made the\r\nattacked ship skip for safety instantly, yet the beams were all but\r\nuseless. For the Miran reserves filled the gap, and the magnetic tornado\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nFor seventeen long minutes the station resisted the attack. Then the\r\nlast of the strained mercury flowed into the receivers, and the vast\r\npower of the atostors was exhausted. Slowly the magnetic fields\r\ndeclined. The great walls of the station felt the clutching lines of\r\nforce--they began to heat and to strain. A low, harsh grinding became\r\naudible over the roar of the atomic bombs. The whole structure trembled,\r\nand jumped slightly. The roar of bombs ceased suddenly, as the station\r\njerked again, more violently. Then it turned a bit, rolled clumsily.\r\nAbruptly it began to spin violently, more and more rapidly. It started\r\nrolling clumsily across the plateau--\r\n\r\nA rain of atomic bombs struck the unprotected metal, and the eighth\r\nbreached the walls. The twentieth was the last. There was no longer an\r\nIP station on Europa.\r\n\r\n\"The difference,\" said Buck Kendall slowly, when the reports came in\r\nfrom scout-ships in space that had witnessed the last struggle, \"between\r\nan atomic generator and an atomic power-store, or accumulator, is\r\nclearly shown. We haven't an adequate _source_ of power.\"\r\n\r\nMcLaurin sighed slowly, and rose to his feet. \"What can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank our lucky stars that Faragaut here, and I, bought up all the\r\nmercury in the system, and had it brought to Earth. We at least have a\r\nsupply of materials for the atostors.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't seem to do much good.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're the best we've got. All the photocells on Earth and Venus and\r\nMercury are at present busy storing the sun's power in atostors. I have\r\ntwo thousand tons of charged mercury in our tanks here in the 'Lunar\r\nBank.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Much good that will do--they can just pull and pull and pull till it's\r\nall gone. A starfish isn't strong, but he can open the strongest oyster\r\njust because he can pull from now on. You may have a lot of power--but.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--we also have those new fifteen-foot UV beams. And one fifteen-foot\r\nUV beam is worth, theoretically, nine five-foot beams, and practically,\r\na dozen. We have a dozen of them. Remember, this place was designed not\r\nonly to protect itself, but Earth, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can still pull, can't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll stop pulling when they get their fingers burned. In the\r\nmeantime, why not use some of those IP ships to bring in a few more\r\ncargoes of charged mercury?\"\r\n\r\n\"They aren't good for much else, are they? I wonder if those fellows\r\nhave anything more we don't know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, probably. I'm going to work on that crumbler thing. That's the\r\nfirst consideration now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"So we can move a ship. As it is, even those two we built aren't any\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they be anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I think I might disturb those gentlemen slightly. Remember, they\r\neach have a nose-beam eighteen feet across. Exceedingly unpleasant\r\ncustomers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Score: Strangers; magnetic field, atomic bombs, atomic power, crumbler\r\nray. Home team; UV beams.\"\r\n\r\nKendall grinned. \"I'd heard you were a pessimistic cuss when battle\r\nstarted--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pessimistic, hell, I'm merely counting things up.\"\r\n\r\n\"McClellan had all the odds on Lee back in the Civil War of the\r\nStates--but Lee sent him home faster than he came.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Lee lost in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why bring that up? I've got work to do.\" Still smiling, Kendall went to\r\nthe laboratory he had built up in the \"Lunar Bank.\" Devin was already\r\nthere, calculating. He looked unhappy.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do anything, as far as I can see. They're using an electric\r\nfield all right, and projecting it. I can't see how we can do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can I,\" agreed Kendall, \"so we can't use that weapon. I really\r\ndidn't want to anyway. Like the neutron gun which I told Commander\r\nMcLaurin would be useless as a weapon, they'd be prepared for it, you\r\ncan be sure. All I want to do is fight it, and make their projection\r\nuseless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have to know how they project it before we can break up the\r\nprojection, don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. They're using an electric field of very high frequency, but\r\nvariable frequency. As far as I can see, all we need is a similar\r\nvariable electric field of a slightly different frequency to heterodyne\r\ntheirs into something quite harmless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Devin. \"We could, couldn't we? But how are you going to do\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to learn, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall started trying to learn. In the meantime, the Mirans were\r\ntaking over Jupiter. There were three IP stations on the planet itself,\r\nbut they were vastly hindered by the thick, almost ultra-violet-proof\r\natmosphere of Jupiter. Their rays were weak. And the magnetic fields of\r\nthe Mirans were unaffected. Only their atomic bombs were hindered by the\r\nheavier gravity that pulled the rocks back in place faster than the\r\nbombs could throw them out. Still--a few hours of work, and the IP\r\nstations on Jupiter had rolled wildly across the flat plains of the\r\nplanet like dented cans, to end in utter destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Mirans had paid no attention to the fleeing passenger and freighter\r\nships that left the planet, loaded to the utmost with human cargo, and\r\nabsolutely no freight. The IP fleet had to go to their rescue with\r\noxygen tanks to take care of the extra humans, but nearly three-quarters\r\nof the population of Jupiter, a newly established population, and hence\r\na readily mobile one, was saved. The others, the Mirans did not bother\r\nwith particularly except when they happened to be near where the Mirans\r\nwanted to work. Then they were instantly destroyed by atomic bombing, or\r\ngamma rays.\r\n\r\nThe Mirans settled almost at once, and began their work of finding on\r\nJupiter the badly needed atomic fuels. Machines were set up, and work\r\nbegun, Mirans laboring under the gravity of the heavy planet. Then,\r\nfifty ships swam up again, reloaded with fuel, and with crews consisting\r\nsolely of uninjured warriors, and started for Mars.\r\n\r\nMars was half way between her near conjunction and her maximum\r\nelongation with respect to Jupiter at that time. The Mirans knew their\r\nbusiness though, for they started in on the IP station on Phobos. They\r\nwere practiced by this time, and this IP station had only seven\r\nfive-foot beams. In half an hour that station fell, and its sister\r\nstation on Deimos followed. Three wounded ships returned to Jupiter, and\r\nten new ships came out. The attack on Mars itself was started.\r\n\r\nMars was a different proposition. There were thirty-two IP stations\r\nhere, one of them nearly as powerful as the Lunar Bank station. It was\r\nequipped with four of the huge fifteen-foot beams. And it had fifteen\r\ntons of mercury, more than seven-eighths charged. The Mars Center\r\nStation was located a short ten miles from the Mars Center City, and\r\nunder the immediate orders of the IP heads, Mars Center City had been\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\nFor two days the Mirans hung off Mars, solidifying their positions on\r\nPhobos and Deimos. Then, with sixty-two ships, they attacked. They had\r\nmade some very astute observations, and they started on the smaller\r\nstations just beyond the range of the Mars Center Station. Naturally,\r\nnear so powerful a center, these stations had never been strong. They\r\nfell rapidly. But they had been counted on by Mars Center as auxiliary\r\nsupports. McLaurin had sent very definite orders to Mars Center\r\nforbidding any action on their part, save gathering of power-supplies.\r\n\r\nAt last the direct attack on Mars Center was launched. For the first\r\ntime, the Mirans saw one of the fifteen-foot beams. Mars' atmosphere is\r\nthin, and there is little ozone. The ultra-violet beams were nearly as\r\neffective as in empty space. When the Mirans dropped their ships, a full\r\nthirty of them, into the circle formation, Mars Center answered at once.\r\nAll four beams started.\r\n\r\nThose fifteen-foot beams, connected directly to huge atostor release\r\napparatus, delivered a maximum power of two and three-quarter billion\r\nhorsepower, each. The first Miran ship struck, sparkled magnificently,\r\nand a terrific cascade of white-hot metal rolled down from its nose. The\r\ngreat ship nosed down and to the left abruptly, accelerated swiftly--and\r\ncrashed with tremendous energy on the plain outside of Mars Center City.\r\nWhite, unwavering flames licked up suddenly, and made a column five\r\nhundred feet high against the dark sky. Then the wreck exploded with a\r\nviolence that left a crater half a mile across.\r\n\r\nThree other ships had been struck, and were rapidly retreating. Another\r\ntry was made for the ring formation, and four more ships were wounded,\r\nand replaced. The ring did not retreat, but the great magnetic field\r\nstarted. Atomic and gamma ray bombs started now, flashing sometimes\r\ndangerously close to the station as its magnetic field battled the\r\nrotating field of the ships. The four greater beams, and many smaller\r\nones were in swift and angry action. Not more than a ten-second exposure\r\ncould be endured by any one ship, before it must retreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor five minutes the Mirans hung doggedly at their task. Then, wisely,\r\nthey retreated. Of the fleet, not more than seven ships remained\r\nuntouched. Mars Center Station had held--at what cost only they knew.\r\nFive hundred tons of their mercury had been exhausted in that brief five\r\nminutes. One hundred tons a minute had flowed into and out of the\r\natostor apparatus. Mars Center radioed for help, when the fleet lifted.\r\n\r\nThere was one other station on Mars that stood a good chance of\r\nsurvival, Deenmor Station, with three of the big beams installed, and\r\napparatus for their fourth was in the station, and being rapidly worked\r\nover. McLaurin did a wise and courageous thing, at which every man on\r\nMars cursed. He ordered that all IP stations save these two be deserted,\r\nand all mercury fuel reserves be moved to Deenmor and Mars Center.\r\n\r\nThe Mirans could not land on the North Western section of Mars, nor in\r\nthe South Central region. Therefore Mars was not exactly habitable to\r\nMiran ships, because the great beams had been so perfectly figured that\r\nthey were effective at a range of nearly twelve hundred miles.\r\n\r\nDeenmor station was attacked--but it was a half-hearted attack, for\r\nMirans were becoming distinctly skittish about fifteen-foot UV beams.\r\nTwo badly blistered ships--and the Mirans retreated to Jupiter. But Mira\r\nheld Phobos and Deimos. In two weeks, they had set up cannon there, and\r\nproved themselves accurate long-range gunners. Against the feeble\r\nattraction of Deimos, and with Mars' gravity to help them, they began\r\nbombarding the two stations, and anything that attempted to approach\r\nthem, with gamma and atomic explosive bombs. Meanwhile they amused\r\nthemselves occasionally by planting a gamma-ray bomb in each of Mars'\r\nmajor cities. They made Mars uninhabitable for Solarians as well as for\r\nMirans, at least until the deadly slow-action atomic explosives wore\r\noff, or were removed.\r\n\r\nThen the Mirans, after a lapse of three weeks while they dug in their\r\ntoes on Jupiter, prepared to leap. Earth was the next goal. Miran\r\nscout-ships had been sent out before this--and severely handled by the\r\nconcentrated fleets of the IP that hung grimly off Earth and Luna now.\r\nBut the scouts had learned one thing. Mirans could never hope to attain\r\na firm grasp on Earth while terribly armed Luna hung like a Sword of\r\nDamocles over their heads. Further, attack on Earth directly would be\r\nnext to impossible, for, thanks to Faragaut's Interplanetary Company,\r\nnearly all the mercury metal in the system was safely lodged on Earth,\r\nand saturated with power. Every major city had been equipped with great\r\nUV apparatus. And neutron guns in plenty waited on small ships just\r\noutside the atmosphere to explode harmlessly any atomic or gamma bombs\r\nMiran ships might attempt to deposit.\r\n\r\nAn attack on Luna was the first step. But that terrible, gigantic fort\r\non Luna worried them. Yet while that fort existed, Earth ships were free\r\nto come and go, for Mirans could not afford to stand near. At a distance\r\nof twenty thousand miles, small Miran ships had felt the touch of those\r\ngreat UV beams.\r\n\r\nFinally, a brief test-attack was made, with an entire fleet of one\r\nhundred ships. They drew almost into position, faster than light, faster\r\nthan the signaling warnings could send their messages. In position, all\r\nthose great ships strained and heaved at the mighty magnetic vortex that\r\ntwisted at the field of the fort. Instantly, twelve of the fifteen-foot\r\nUV beams replied. And--two great UV beams of a size the Mirans had never\r\nseen before, beams from the two ships, \"S Doradus\" and \"Cepheid.\"\r\n\r\nThe test-attack dissolved as suddenly as it had come. The Mirans\r\nreturned to Jupiter, and to the outer planets where they had further\r\nestablished themselves. Most of the Solar system was theirs. But the\r\nSolarians still held the choicest planets--and kept the Mirans from\r\nusing the mild-temperatured Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They can't take this, at least,\" sighed McLaurin as they retreated from\r\nLuna.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think they could--right away. I'm wondering though if they\r\nhaven't something we haven't seen yet. Besides which--give them time,\r\ngive them time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, give us time, too,\" snapped McLaurin. \"How are you coming?\"\r\n\r\nBuck smiled. \"I'm sure I don't know. I have a machine but I haven't the\r\nslightest idea of whether or not it's any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can destroy--I hope--but I can't build up their ray. I can't test the\r\nmachine because I haven't their ray to test it against.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do to test it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I can see is to call for volunteers--and send out a\r\nsix-man cruiser. If the ship's too small, they may not destroy it with\r\nthe big crumbler rays. If it's too large--and the machine didn't\r\nwork--we'd lose too much.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve hours later, the IP men at the Lunar Bank fort were lined up.\r\nMcLaurin stepped up on the platform, and addressed the men briefly, told\r\nthem what was needed. Six volunteers were selected by a process of\r\nelimination, those who were married, had dependents, officers, and\r\nothers were refused. Finally, six men of the IP were chosen, neither\r\nrookies nor veterans, six average men. And one average six-man cruiser,\r\none hundred and eleven feet long, twenty-two in diameter. It was the\r\nT-208, a sister ship of the T-247, the first ship to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe T-208 started out from Luna, and with full acceleration, sped out\r\ntoward Phobos. Slowly she circled the satellite, while distant scouts\r\nkept her under view. Lazily, the Miran patrol on Phobos watched the\r\nT-208, indifferent to her. The T-208 dove suddenly, after five fruitless\r\ncircles of the tiny world, and with her four-foot UV beam flaming,\r\nstabbed angrily at a flight of Miran scouts berthed in the very shadow\r\nof a great battle cruiser, one of the interstellar ships stationed here\r\non Phobos.\r\n\r\nFour of the little ships slumped in incandescence. Angrily the terrific\r\nsword of energy slashed at the frail little scouts.\r\n\r\nAngrily the Miran interstellar ship shot herself abruptly into action\r\nagainst this insolent cruiser. The cruiser launched a flight of the\r\nmercury-torpedoes. Flashing, burning, ultra-violet energy flooded the\r\ngreat ship, harmlessly, for the men were, as usual, protected. The Miran\r\nanswered with the neutron beam, atomic and gamma bombs--and the crumbler\r\nray.\r\n\r\nGently, softly a halo of shimmering-violet luminescence built up about\r\nthe T-208. The UV beam continued to flare, wavering slightly in its\r\naim--then fell way off to one side. The T-208 staggered suddenly,\r\nwandered from her course--whole, but uncontrolled. For the men within\r\nthe ship were dead.\r\n\r\nMajestically the Miran swung along beside the dead ship, a great\r\nmagnetic tow-cable shot out toward it, to shy off at first, then slowly\r\nto be adjusted, and take hold in the magnetic shield of the T-208. The\r\npilots of the watching scout-ships turned away. They knew what would\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nIt did. Five--ten--twenty seconds passed. Then the \"dead-man\" took over\r\nthe ship--and the stored power in the atostor tanks blasted in a\r\nterrible flame that shattered the metal hull to molecular fragments. The\r\ninterstellar cruiser shuddered, and rolled half over at the blasting\r\npressure. Leaking seams appeared in her plates.\r\n\r\nThe scouts raced back to Luna as the Miran settled heavily, and a trifle\r\nclumsily to Phobos. Miran radio-beams were forcing their way out toward\r\nthe Miran station on Europa, to be relayed to the headquarters on\r\nJupiter, just as Solarian radio beams were thrusting through space\r\ntoward Luna. Said the Miran messages: \"Their ships no longer crumble.\"\r\nSaid the Solarian messages: \"The ships no longer crumble--but the men\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis deep eyes burning tensely, Buck Kendall heard the messages coming\r\nin, and rose slowly from his seat to pace the floor. \"I think I know\r\nwhy,\" he said at last. \"I should have thought. For that too can be\r\nprevented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--what in the name of the Planets?\" asked McLaurin. \"It didn't kill\r\nthe men in the forts--why does it kill the men in the ships, when the\r\nships are protected?\"\r\n\r\n\"The protection kills them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but they had the protective oscillations on all the way out!\"\r\nprotested the Commander.\r\n\r\n\"Think how it works though. Think, man. The enemy's field is an\r\nelectric-field oscillation. We combat it by setting up a similar\r\noscillating field in the metal of the hull ourselves. Because the metal\r\nconducts the strains, they meet, and oppose. It is not a shield--a\r\nshield is impossible, as I have said, because of energy concentration\r\nfactors. If their beam carried a hundred thousand horsepower in a\r\nten-foot square beam, in every ten square feet of our shield, we'd have\r\nto have one hundred thousand horsepower. In other words, hundreds of\r\ntimes as much energy would be needed in the shield, as they used in\r\ntheir beam. We can't afford that. We had to let the beams oppose our\r\noscillations in the metal, where, because the metal conducts, they meet\r\non an equal basis. But--when two oscillations of slightly different\r\nfrequency meet, what is the result?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case, a heterodyne frequency of a lower, and harmless\r\nfrequency.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought. I was partly right. It does _not_ harm the metal. But it\r\nkills the men. It is super-sonic. The terrible, shrill sounds destroy\r\nthe cells of the men's bodies. Then, when their dead hands release the\r\ncontrols, the automatic switches blow up the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"God! We stop one menace--and it is like the Hydra. For every head we\r\nlop off, two spring up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--but they are lesser heads. Look, what is the fundamental difference\r\nbetween sound and light?\"\r\n\r\n\"One is a vibration of matter and the--ah--eliminate the material\r\ncontact!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! All we need to do is to let the ships operate airless, the men\r\nin space suits. Then the air cannot carry the sounds to them. And by\r\nputting special damping materials in their suits, we can stop the\r\nvibrations that would reach them through their feet and hands. Another\r\nsix-man ship must go out--but this ship will come back!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the order for another experimental ship, went the orders for\r\ncommercial supplies of this new apparatus. Every IP ship must be\r\nequipped to resist it.\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall sailed on the six-man scout that went out this time. Again\r\nthey swooped once at Phobos, again Miran scout-ships crumbled under the\r\nattack of the vicious UV beams. The Mirans were not waiting\r\ncontemptuously this time. In an instant the great interstellar ship rose\r\nfrom its berth, its weapons working angrily. The crumbler ray snapped\r\nout at the T-253.\r\n\r\nKendall stared into the periscope visor intently. Clumsily his padded\r\nhands worked at the specially adapted controls. The soft hiss of the\r\noxygen release into his suit disturbed him slightly. The radio-phones in\r\nhis helmet carried all the conversations in the ship to him with equal\r\nclarity. He watched as the great ship angled angrily up--\r\n\r\nHis vision was momentarily obscured by a violet glow that built up and\r\nreached out gently from every point of metal in the ship. The instant\r\nKendall saw that, the T-253 was fleeing under his hands. The test had\r\nbeen made. Now all he desired was safety again. The ion-rockets flared\r\nrecklessly as, crushed under an acceleration of four Earth-gravities, he\r\nsank heavily into his seat. Grimly the Miran ship was pursuing them,\r\neasily keeping up with the fleeing midget. The crumbler became more\r\nintense, the violet glow more vivid.\r\n\r\nThe UV beam was reaching out directly behind now. The--\r\n\r\nWith a cry of agony, Kendall ripped the radio-phone connection out of\r\nhis suit. A soft hiss of leaking air warned him of too great violence\r\nonly minutes later. For his ears had been deafened by the sudden shriek\r\nof a tremendous signal from outside!\r\n\r\nInstantly Kendall knew what that meant. And he could not communicate\r\nwith his men! There was no metal in these special suits, even the oxygen\r\ntanks were made of synthetic plastics of tremendous strength. No scrap\r\nof vibrating metal was permissible. The padded gloves and boots\r\nprotected him--but there was a new and different type of crackle and\r\nhaze from the metal points now. It was almost invisible in the\r\npractically airless ship, but Kendall saw it.\r\n\r\nPresently he felt it, as he desperately increased his acceleration. Slow\r\ncreeping heat was attacking him. The heat was increasing rapidly now.\r\nDesperately he was working at the crumbler-protection controls--but\r\nimmediately set them back as they were. He had to have the crumbler\r\nprotection as well--!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrimly the great Miran ship hung right beside them. Angrily the two\r\nfour-foot UV beams flashed back--seeking some weak spot. There were\r\nnone. At her absolute maximum of acceleration the little ship plunged\r\non. Gamma and atomic bombs were washing her in flame. The heavy blocks\r\nof paraffin between her walls were long since melted, retained only by\r\nthe presence of the metal walls. Smoke was beginning to filter out now,\r\nand Kendall recognized a new, and deadlier menace! Heat--quantities of\r\nheat were being poured into the little ship, and the neutron guns were\r\ndoing their best to add to it. The paraffin was confined in there--and\r\nlike any substance, it could be volatilized, and as a vapor, develop\r\npressure--explosive pressure!\r\n\r\nThe Miran seemed satisfied in his tactics so far--and changed them.\r\nForty-seven million miles from Earth, the Miran simply accelerated a bit\r\nmore, and crowded the Solarian ship a bit. White-faced, Buck Kendall was\r\nforced to turn a bit aside. The Miran turned also. Kendall turned a bit\r\nmore--\r\n\r\nFlashing across his range of vision at an incredible speed, a tiny\r\nthing, no more than twenty feet long and five in diameter, a scout-ship\r\nappeared. Its tiny nose ultra-violet beam was blasting a solid cylinder\r\nof violet incandescence a foot across in the hull of the Miran--and, to\r\nthe Miran, angling swiftly across his range of vision. Its magnetic\r\nfield clashed for a thousandth of a second with the T-253, instantly\r\nmeeting, and absorbing the fringing edges. Then--it swept through the\r\nMiran's magnetic shield as easily. The delicate instruments of the scout\r\ninstantaneously adjusted its own magnetic field as much as possible.\r\nThere was resistance, enormous resistance--the ship crumpled in on\r\nitself, the tail vanished in dust as a sweeping crumbler beam caught it\r\nat last--and the remaining portion of the ship plowed into the nose of\r\nthe Miran.\r\n\r\nThe Miran's force-control-room was wrecked. For perhaps a minute and a\r\nhalf, the ship was without control, then the control was\r\nre-established--and in vain the telescopes and instruments searched for\r\nthe T-253. Lightless, her rockets out now, her fields damped down to\r\nextinction, the T-253 was lost in the pulsing, gyrating fields of half a\r\ndozen scout-ships.\r\n\r\nKendall looked grimly at the crushed spot on the nose of the Miran. His\r\nship was drifting slowly away from the greater ship. Presently, however,\r\nthe Miran put on speed in the direction of Earth, and the T-253 fell far\r\nbehind. The Miran was not seriously injured. But that scout pilot, in\r\nsacrificing life, had thrown dust in their eyes for just those few\r\nmoments Kendall had needed to lose a lightless ship in lightless\r\nspace--lightless--for the Mirans at any rate. The IP ships had been\r\ncovered with a black paint, and in no time at all, Kendall had gotten\r\nhis ship into a position where the energy radiations of the sun made him\r\nundetectable from the Miran's position, since the radiation of his own\r\nship, even in the heat range, was mingled with the direct radiation of\r\nthe sun. The sun was in the Miran's \"eyes,\" both actual and\r\ninstrumental.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the Miran returned, passed the still-lightless ship at a\r\ndistance of five million miles, and settled to Phobos for the slight\r\nrepairs needed.\r\n\r\nTwelve hours later, the T-253 settled to Luna, for the many\r\nrearrangements she would need.\r\n\r\n\"I rather knew it was coming,\" Kendall admitted sadly, \"but danged if I\r\ndidn't forget all about it. And--cost the life of one of the finest men\r\nin the system. Jehnson's family get a permanent pension just twice his\r\nsalary, McLaurin. In the meantime--\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it? Pure heat, but how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure radio. Nothing but short-wave radio directed at us. They probably\r\nhad the apparatus, knew how to make it, but that's not a good type of\r\nheat ray, because a radio tube is generally less than eighty percent\r\nefficient, which is a whale of a loss when you're working in a battle,\r\nand a whale of an inconvenience. We were heated only four times as much\r\nas the Miran. He had to pump that heat into a heat-reservoir--a water\r\ntank probably--to protect himself. Highly inefficient and ineffective\r\nagainst a large ship. Also, he had to hold his beam on us nearly ten\r\nminutes before it would have become unbearable. He was again, trying to\r\nkill the men, and not the ship. The men are the weakest point,\r\nobviously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you overcome that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, no. The thing works on pure energy. I'd have to match his\r\nenergy to neutralize it. You knew it's an old proposition, that if you\r\ncould take a beam of pure, monochromatic light and divide it exactly in\r\nhalf, and then recombine it in perfect interference, you'd have\r\nannihilation of energy. Cancellation to extinction. The trouble is, you\r\nnever do get that. You can't get monochromatic light, because light\r\ncan't be monochromatic. That's due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty--my pet\r\nbug-bear. The atom that radiates the light, must be moving. If it isn't,\r\nthe emission of the light itself gives it a kick that moves it. Now, no\r\nmatter what the quantum _might_ have been, it loses energy in kicking\r\nthe atom. That changes the situation instantly, and incidentally the\r\n'color' of the light. Then, since all the radiating atoms won't be\r\nmoving alike, etc., the mass of light can't be monochromatic. Therefore\r\nperfect interference is impossible.\r\n\r\n\"The way that relates to the problem in hand, is that we can't possibly\r\ndestroy his energy. We can, as we do in the crumbler stunt, change it.\r\nHe can't, I suspect, put too much power behind his crumbler, or he'd\r\nhave crumbling going on at home. We get a slight heating from it,\r\nanyway. Into the bargain, his radio was after us, and his neutrons\r\nnaturally carried energy. Now, no matter what we do, we've got that to\r\nhandle. When we fight his crumbler, we actually add heat-energy to it,\r\nourselves, and make the heating effect just twice as bad. If we try to\r\nheterodyne his radio--presto--it has twice the heat energy anyway,\r\nthough we might reduce it to a frequency that penetrated the ship\r\ninstead of all staying in it. But by the proposition, we have to use as\r\nmuch energy, and in fact, remember the 80% rule. We've got to take it\r\nand like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected McLaurin, \"we _don't_ like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then build ships as big as his, and he'll quit trying to roast you.\r\nParticularly if the inner walls are synthetic plastics. Did you know I\r\nused them in the 'S Doradus' and 'Cepheid'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Were you thinking of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--just luck--and the fact that they're light, strong as steel almost,\r\nand can be manufactured in forms much more quickly. Only the outer hull\r\nis tungsten-beryllium. The advantage in this will be that nearly all the\r\nenergy will be absorbed outside, and we'll radiate pretty fast,\r\nparticularly as that tungsten-beryllium has a high radiation-factor in\r\nthe long heat range.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ordinary polished silver is a mighty poor radiator. Homely\r\nexample: Try waiting for your coffee to cool if it's in a polished\r\nsilver pot. Then try it in a tungsten-beryllium pot. No matter how you\r\npolish that tungsten-beryllium, the stuff WILL radiate heat. That's why\r\nan IP ship is always so blamed cold. You know the passenger ships use\r\npolished aluminum outer walls. The big help is, that the\r\ntungsten-beryllium will throw off the energy pretty fast, and in a big\r\nship, with a whale of a lot of matter to heat, the Strangers will simply\r\ngive up the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but only two ships in the system compare with them in size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry--but I didn't build the IP fleet, and there are lots of tungsten\r\nand beryllium on Earth. Enough anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they use that beam on the fort? And can't we use the thing on\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't and we won't--though we could. A bank of those new million\r\nwatt tubes--perhaps a hundred of them--and we'd have a pretty effective\r\nheater--but an awful waste of power. I've got something better.\"\r\n\r\n\"New?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat. I've found out how to make the mirror field in a plate of\r\nmetal, instead of a block. Come on to the lab, and I'll show you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the advantage? Oh--weight saved, and silver metal saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot more than that, Mac. Watch.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the laboratory, the new apparatus looked immensely lighter and\r\nsimpler than the old. The atostor, the ionizer, and the twin\r\nion-projectors were as before, great, rigid, metal structures that would\r\nmaintain the meeting point of the ions with inflexible exactitude under\r\nany acceleration strains. But now, instead of the heavy silver block in\r\nwhich a mirror was figured, the mirror consisted of a polished silver\r\nplate, parabolic to be sure, but little more than a half-inch in\r\nthickness. It was mounted in a framework of complex, stout metal braces.\r\n\r\nKendall started the ion-flame at low intensity, so the UV beam was\r\nlittle more than a spotlight.\r\n\r\n\"You missed the point, Mac. Now--watch that tungsten-beryllium plate.\r\nI'll hold the power steady. It's an eighteen-inch beam--and now the\r\nenergy is just sufficient to heat that tungsten plate to bright red.\r\nBut--\"\r\n\r\nKendall turned over a small rheostat control--and abruptly the\r\neighteen-inch diameter spot on the tungsten-beryllium plate began\r\ncontracting; it contracted till it was a blazing, sparkling spot of\r\nmolten incandescence less than an inch across!\r\n\r\n\"That's the advantage of focus. At this distance of a few hundred feet\r\nwith a small beam I can do that. With a twenty-foot beam, I can get a\r\ntwo-foot spot at a distance of nearly ten miles! That means that the\r\nreceiving end will have the pleasure of handling _one hundred times the\r\nenergy concentration_. That would punch a hole through most anything.\r\nAll you have to do is focus it. The trouble being, if it's out of focus\r\nthe advantage is more than lost. So if there's any question about\r\ngetting the focus, we'll get along without it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A real help, if you do. That would punch a hole before the Stranger\r\nship could turn away as they do now.\"\r\n\r\nKendall nodded. \"That's what I was after. It is mainly for the forts,\r\nthough. We'll have to signal the dope to the Mars Center and Deenmor\r\nstations. They can fix it up, themselves. In the meantime--all we can do\r\nis hold on and hunt, and let's hope better than the Strangers do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nSadly the convalescent Gresth Gkae listened to the reports of his\r\nlieutenants. More and more disgraced he felt as he realized how badly he\r\nhad blundered in reporting the people of this system unable to cope with\r\nthe attackers' weapons. Gresth Gkae looked up at his old friend and\r\nphysician, Merth Skahl. He shook his head slowly. \"I'm afraid, Merth\r\nSkahl. I am afraid. We have, perhaps, made a mistake. The better and the\r\nstronger alone should rule. Aye, but is the _stronger_ always the\r\n_better_? I am afraid we have mistaken the Truth in assuming this. If we\r\nhave--then may Jarth, Lord of Truth and Wisdom punish us. Mighty Jarth,\r\nif I have mistaken in following my judgments, it is not from\r\ndisobedience, it is lack of Thy knowledge. The strongest--they are not\r\nalways the better, are they?\"\r\n\r\nMerth Skahl bent sharply over his friend. \"Quiet thyself, Gresth Gkae.\r\nYou know, and I know, you have done only your best, and surely Jarth\r\nhimself can ask no better of any one. You must rest, for only by rest\r\ncan those terrible burns be healed. All your _stheen_ over half the\r\nbody-area was burned off. You have been delirious for many days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Merth Skahl, think--have we disobeyed Jarth's will? It is, we know,\r\nhis will that only the best and the strongest shall rule--but are the\r\nbest always the strongest? An imbecile adult could destroy the life of a\r\ngenius-grade child. The strongest wins, but not the best. Such would not\r\nbe the will of Jarth. If we be the stronger, _and_ the best, then it is\r\nright and just that these strange creatures should be destroyed that we\r\nmay have a stable world of stable light and heat. But look and see, with\r\nwhat terrible swiftness these strange creatures have learned! May it not\r\nbe they are the better race--that it is _we_ who are the weaker and the\r\npoorer? Can it be that Jarth has brought us together that these people\r\nmight learn--and destroy us? If they be the stronger, and the\r\nbetter--then may Jarth's will be done. But we must test our strength to\r\nthe utmost. I must rise, and go to my laboratory soon. They have set it\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, they have, Gresth Gkae. But remember, the weak and the sick make\r\nfaults the strong and the well do not. Better that you rest yourself.\r\nThere is little you can do while your body seeks to recover from these\r\nterrible burns.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, my friend, wrong. Don't you see that my mind is\r\nclear--that it is the mind which must fight in these battles, for surely\r\nthe man is weak against such things as this infra-X-radiation? Why, I am\r\nbetter able to fight now than are you, for I am a trained fighter of the\r\nmind, while you are a trained healer of the body. These strange beings\r\nwith their stiff arms and legs, their tender skins, and--and their swift\r\nminds have fought us all too well. If we must test, let it be a test. I\r\nhave heard how they so quickly solved the riddle of the crumbling field.\r\nThat took us longer, and we designed it. The Counsel of Worlds put me in\r\ncommand, let me up, Skahl, I must work.\"\r\n\r\nConcerned, the physician looked down at him. Finally he spoke again.\r\n\"No, I will not permit you to leave the hospital-ship. You must stay\r\nhere, but if, as you have said, the mind is what must fight, then surely\r\nyou can fight well from here, for your mind is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot, and you well know it. I may shorten my life, but what\r\nmatter. 'Death is the end toward which the chemical reaction, Life,\r\ntends,'\" quoted the scientist. \"You know I have left my children--my\r\nimmortality is assured through them. I can afford to die in peace, if it\r\nassures their welfare. Time is precious, and while my mind might work\r\nfrom here, it must have data on which to work. For that, I must go to\r\nthe laboratories. Help me, Merth Skahl.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly the physician granted the request, but begged of Gresth Gkae\r\na promise of at least six hours rest in every fifteen, and a good sleep\r\nof at least twenty-seven hours every \"night.\" Gresth Gkae agreed, and\r\nfrom a wheelchair, conducted his work, began a new line of\r\nexperimentation he hoped would yield them the weapon they needed. Under\r\nhim, the staff of scientists worked, aiding and advising and suggesting.\r\nThe apparatus was built, tested, and found wanting. Time and again as\r\nthe days passed, they watched Gresth Gkae, gaining strength very, very\r\nslowly, taken away despondent at the end of his forty hours of work.\r\n\r\nA dozen expeditions were sent to Jupiter's poles to watch and measure\r\nand study the tremendous auroral displays there, where Jupiter's vast\r\nmagnetic field sucked in countless quintillions of the flying electrons\r\nfrom the sun, and brought them circling in, in a vast, magnificent\r\ndisplay of auroral ionization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExpeditions went to the great Southern Plateau, the Plateau of Storms,\r\nwhere the titanic air currents resulted in an everlasting display of\r\nterrific lightnings, great burning balls of electric force floating\r\ndangerous and deadly across the frozen, ultra-cold plain.\r\n\r\nAnd the expeditions brought back data. Yet still Gresth Gkae could not\r\nsleep, his thoughts intruding constantly. Hours Merth Skahl spent with\r\nhim, calming him to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"But what is this constant search? It is little enough I know of\r\nscience, but why do you send our men to these spots of wonderfully\r\nbeautiful, but useless natural forces. Can we somehow, do you think,\r\nturn them against the people of these worlds?\"\r\n\r\nSoftly the old Miran smiled. \"Yes, you might say so. For look, it is the\r\nstrange balls of electric force I want to know about. Sthor had few, but\r\noccasionally we saw them. Never were they properly investigated. I want\r\nto know their secret, for I am sure they are balls of electric forces\r\nnot vastly dissimilar from the nucleus of the atom. Always we have known\r\nthat no system of purely electrical forces could remain stable. Yet\r\nthese strange balls of energy do. How is it? I am sure it will be of\r\nvast importance. But the direct secret I hope to learn is in this: What\r\ncan be done with electric fields can nearly always be duplicated, or\r\nparalleled in magnetic fields. If I can learn how to make these\r\nelectric balls of energy, can I not hope to make similar magnetic balls\r\nof energy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see--that would seem true. But what benefit would you derive\r\nfrom that? You have magnetic beams now, and yet they are useless because\r\nyou can get nowhere near the forts. How then would these benefit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do nothing to those forts, because of that magnetic shield.\r\nCould we once break it down, then the fort is helpless, and one or two\r\nsmall atomic bombs destroy it. But--we cannot stay near, for the\r\nterrible infra-X-rays of theirs burn holes in our ships, and--in our\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"But look you, I can drop many atomic bombs from a distance where their\r\nbeams are ineffective. Suppose I _do_ make a magnetic ball of energy, a\r\nmagnetic bomb. Then--I can drop it from a distance! We have learned that\r\nthe power supply of these forts is very great--but not endless, as is\r\nours now, thanks to the vast supplies of power metal on this heavy\r\nplanet. Then all we need do is stay at a distance where they cannot\r\nreach us--and drop magnetic bombs. Ah, they will be stopped, and their\r\nenergy absorbed. But we can keep it up, day after day, and slowly drain\r\nout their power. Then--then our atomic bombs can destroy those forts,\r\nand we can move on!\" But suddenly the animation and strength left his\r\nvoice. He turned a sad, downcast face to his friend. \"But Merth Skahl,\r\nwe can't do it,\" he complained.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--now I can see why you so want to continue this wearing and worrying\r\nwork. You need time, Gresth Gkae, only time for success. Tomorrow it may\r\nbe that you will see the first hint that will lead you to success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--I only hope it, Merth Skahl, I only hope it.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was the next day that they saw the first glimpse of the secret,\r\nand saw the path that might lead to hope and success. In a week they\r\nwere sending electric bombs across the laboratory. And in three days\r\nmore, a magnetic bomb streaked dully across the laboratory to a magnetic\r\nshield they had set up, and buried itself in it, to explode in brilliant\r\nlight and heat.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Gresth Gkae began to mend. In the three weeks that were\r\nneeded to build the apparatus into ships, he regained strength so that\r\nwhen the first flight of five interstellar ships rose from Jupiter, he\r\nwas on the flagship.\r\n\r\nTo Phobos they went first, to the little inner satellite of Mars,\r\nscarcely eight miles in diameter, a tiny bit of broken metal and rock,\r\nutterly airless, but scarcely more than 3700 miles from the surface of\r\nMars below. The Mars Center and Deenmor forts were wasting no power\r\nraying a ship at that distance. They could, of course, have damaged it,\r\nbut not severely enough to make up for the loss of their strictly\r\nlimited power. The photocells had been working overtime, every minute of\r\navailable light had been used, and still scarcely 2100 tons of charged\r\nmercury remained in the tanks of Mars Center and 1950 in the tanks at\r\nDeenmor.\r\n\r\nThe flight of five ships settled comfortably upon Phobos, while the\r\nthree relieved of duty started back to Jupiter. Immediately work was\r\nbegun on the attack. The ships were first landed on the near side, while\r\nthe apparatus of the projectors was unloaded, then the great ships moved\r\naround to the far side. Phobos of course rotated with one face fixed\r\nirrevocably toward Mars itself, the other always to the cold of space.\r\nGreat power leads trailed beneath the ships, and to the dark side. Then\r\nthere were huge water lines for cooling. On this almost weightless\r\nworld, where the great ships weighing hundreds of thousands of tons on a\r\nplanet, weighed so little they were frequently moved about by a single\r\nman, the laying of five miles of water conduit was no impossibility.\r\n\r\nThen they were ready. Mars Center came first. Automatic devices kept the\r\naim exact, as the first of the magnetic bombs started down. At\r\nfive-second intervals they were projected outward, invisible globes of\r\nconcentrated magnetic energy, undetectable in space. Seven seconds\r\npassed before the first became dimly visible in the thin air of Mars. It\r\nfloated down, it would miss the fort it seemed--so far to one side--\r\nAbruptly it turned, and darted with tremendously accelerating speed for\r\nthe great magnetic field of the fort. With a vast blast of light, it\r\nexploded. Five seconds later a second exploded. And a third.\r\n\r\nMars Center signaled scoffingly that the bombs were all being stopped\r\ndead in the magnetic atmosphere, after the bombardment had been\r\nwitnessed from Earth and Luna. An hour later they gave a report that\r\nthey were concentrated magnetic fields of energy that would be rather\r\ndangerous--if it weren't that they couldn't even stand into the magnetic\r\natmosphere. Three hours later Mars Center reported that they contained\r\nconsiderably more energy than had at first been thought. Further, which\r\nthey had not carefully considered at first, they were taking energy with\r\nthem! They were taking away about an equal amount of energy as each blew\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt was only a half-hour after that that the men at Mars Center realized\r\nperfectly what it meant. Their power was being drained just a little bit\r\nbetter than twice as fast as they generated during the day--and since\r\nPhobos spun so swiftly across the sky.\r\n\r\nDeenmor got the attack just about the time Mars Center was released.\r\nDeenmor immediately began seeking for the source of it. Somewhere on\r\nPhobos--but where?\r\n\r\nThe Mirans were experts at camouflage. Deenmor Station, realizing the\r\nmenace, immediately rayed the \"projector.\" They tore up a great deal of\r\nharmless rock with their huge UV rays. But the bomb device continued to\r\nthrow one bomb each five seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen Deenmor operated from Phobos' position, Mars Center was exposed to\r\nthe deadly, constant drain. A day or two later, the bombs were coming\r\none each second and a half, for more ships had joined in the work on\r\nPhobos.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae saw the work was going nicely. He knew that now it was only\r\na question of time before those magnetic shields would fail--and then\r\nthe whole fort would be powerless. Maybe--it might be a good idea, when\r\nthe forts were powerless to investigate instead of blowing them up.\r\nThere might be many interesting and worthwhile pieces of\r\napparatus--particularly the UV beam's apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall entered the Communications room rather furtively. He hated\r\nthe place. Cole was there, and McLaurin. Mac was looking tired and\r\ndrawn, Cole not so tired, but equally drawn. The signals were coming\r\nthrough fairly well, because most of the disturbance was rising where\r\nthe signals rose, and all the disturbance, practically, was magnetic\r\nrather than electric.\r\n\r\n\"Deenmor is sending, Buck,\" McLaurin said as he entered. \"They're down\r\nto the last fifty-five tons. They'll have more time now--a rest while\r\nPhobos sinks. Mars Center has another 250 tons, but--it's just a\r\nquestion of time. Have you any hope to offer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Kendall in a strained voice. \"But, Mac, I don't think men\r\nlike those are afraid to die. It's dying uselessly they fear. Tell\r\n'em--tell 'em they've defended not alone Mars, but all the system, in\r\nholding up the Strangers on Mars. We here on Luna have been safer\r\nbecause of them. And tell--Mac, tell them that in the meantime, while\r\nthey defended us, and gave us time to work, we have begun to see the\r\ntrail that will lead to victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You have!_\" gasped McLaurin.\r\n\r\n\"No--but they will never know!\" Kendall left hastily. He went and stood\r\nmoodily looking at the calculator machines--the calculator machines that\r\nrefused to give the answers he sought. No matter how he might modify\r\nthat original idea of his, no matter what different line of attack he\r\nmight try in solving the problems of Space and Matter, while he used the\r\nsystem he _knew_ was right--the answer came down to that deadly,\r\nhope-blasting expression that meant only \"uncertain.\"\r\n\r\nEven Buck was beginning to feel uncertain under that constant crushing\r\nof hope. Uncertainty--uncertainty was eating into him, and destroying--\r\n\r\nFrom the Communications room came the hum and drive of the great sender\r\nflashing its message across seventy-two millions of miles of nothing.\r\n\"B-u-c-k K-e-n-d-a-l-l s-a-y-s h-e h-a-s l-e-a-r-n-e-d s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g\r\nt-h-a-t w-i-l-l l-e-a-d t-o v-i-c-t-o-r-y w-h-i-l-e y-o-u h-e-l-d\r\nb-a-c-k t-h-e--\"\r\n\r\nKendall switched on a noisy, humming fan viciously. The too-intelligible\r\nsignals were drowned in its sound.\r\n\r\n\"And--tell them to--destroy the apparatus before the last of the power\r\nis gone,\" McLaurin ordered softly.\r\n\r\nThe men in Deenmor station did slightly better than that. Gradually they\r\ncut down their magnetic shield, and some of the magnetic bombs tore and\r\ntwisted viciously at the heavy metal walls. The thin atmosphere of Mars\r\nleaked in. Grimly the men waited. Atomic bombs--or ships to investigate?\r\nIt did not matter much to them personally--\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae smiled with his old vigor as he ordered one of the great\r\ninterstellar ships to land beside the powerless station, approaching\r\nfrom such an angle that the still-active Mars Center station could not\r\nattack. One of the fleet of Phobos rose, and circled about the planet,\r\nand settled gracefully beside the station. For half an hour it lay there\r\nquietly, waiting and watching. Then a crew of two dozen Mirans started\r\nacross the dry, crumbly powder of Mars' sands, toward the fort.\r\nSimultaneously almost, three things happened. A three-foot UV beam wiped\r\nout the advancing party. A pair of fifteen-foot beams cut a great gaping\r\nhole in the wall of the interstellar ship, as it darted up, like a\r\nstartled quail, its weapons roaring defiance, only to fall back,\r\nseverely wounded.\r\n\r\nAnd the radio messages pounded out to Earth the first description of the\r\nMiran people. Methodically the men in Deenmor station used all but one\r\nton of their power to completely and forever wreck and destroy the\r\ninterstellar cripple that floundered for a few moments on the sands a\r\nbare mile away. Presently, before Deenmor was through with it, the\r\natomic bombs stopped coming, and the atomic shells. The magnetic shield\r\nthat had been re-established for the few minutes of this last, dying\r\nsting, fell.\r\n\r\nDeenmor station vanished in a sudden, colossal tongue of blue-green\r\nlight as the ton of atomically distorted mercury was exploded by a\r\nprojector beam turned on the tank.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was long gone, when the first atomic bombs and magnetic bombs dropped\r\nfrom Phobos reached the spot, and only hot rock and broken metal\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nMars Center failed in fact the next time Phobos rode high over it. The\r\napparatus here had been carefully destroyed by technicians with a view\r\nof making it indecipherable, but the Mirans made it even more certain,\r\nfor no ship settled here to investigate, but a stream of atomic bombs\r\nthat lasted for over an hour, and churned the rock to dust, and the dust\r\nto molten lava, in which pools of fused tungsten-beryllium alloy bubbled\r\nslowly and sank.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Jarth--they are a brave race, whatever we may say of their queer\r\nshape,\" sighed Gresth Gkae as the last of Mars Center sank in bubbling\r\nlava. \"They stung as they died.\" For some minutes he was silent.\r\n\r\n\"We must move on,\" he said at length. \"I have been thinking, and it\r\nseems best that a few ships land here, and establish a fort, while some\r\ntwenty move on to the satellite of the third planet and destroy the fort\r\nthere. We cannot operate against the planet while that hangs above us.\"\r\n\r\nSeven ships settled to Mars, while the fleet came up from Jupiter to\r\njoin with Gresth Gkae's flight of ships on its way to Luna.\r\n\r\nAn automatically controlled ship was sent ahead, and began the\r\nbombardment. It approached slowly, and was not destroyed by the UV beams\r\ntill it had come to within 40,000 miles of the fort. At 60,000 Gresth\r\nGkae stationed his fleet--and returned to 150,000 immediately as the\r\ntitanic UV beams of the Lunar Fort stretched out to their maximum range.\r\nThe focus made a difference. One ship started limping back to Jupiter,\r\nin tow of a second, while the rest began the slow, methodical work of\r\nwearing down the defenses of the Lunar Fort.\r\n\r\nKendall looked out at the magnificent display of clashing, warring\r\nenergies, the great, whirling spheres and discs of opalescent flame, and\r\nturned away sadly. \"The men at Deenmor must have watched that for days.\r\nAnd at Mars Center.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long can we hold out?\" asked McLaurin.\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks or so, at the present rate. That's a long time, really. And\r\nwe can escape if we want to. The UV beams here have a greater range than\r\nany weapon the Strangers have, and with Earth so near--oh, we could\r\nescape. Little good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Buck Kendall, suddenly savage, \"am going to consign all the\r\nmath machines in the universe to eternal damnation--and go ahead and\r\nbuild a machine anyway. I _know_ that thing ought to be right. The\r\nmath's wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no other thing to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"A billion others. I don't know how many others. We ought to get atomic\r\nenergy somehow. But that thing infuriates me. A hundred things that math\r\nhas predicted, that I have checked by experiment, simple little things.\r\nBut--when I carry it through to the point where I can get something\r\nuseful--it wriggles off into--uncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nKendall stalked off to the laboratory. Devin was there working over the\r\ncalculus machines, and Kendall called him angrily. Then more apologetic,\r\nhe explained it was anger at himself. \"Devin, I'm going to make that\r\nthing, if it blows up and kills me. I'm going to make that thing if this\r\nwhole fort blows up and kills me. That math has blown up in my face for\r\nfour solid months, and half killed me, so I'm going to kill it. Come on,\r\nwe'll make that damned junk.\"\r\n\r\nAngrily, furiously, Kendall drove his helpers to the task. He had worked\r\nout the apparatus in plan a dozen times, and now he had the plans turned\r\ninto patterns, the patterns into metal.\r\n\r\nSaucily, the \"S Doradus\" made the trip to and from Earth with patterns,\r\nand with metal, with supplies and with apparatus. But she had to dodge\r\nand fight every inch of the way as the Miran ships swooped down angrily\r\nat her. A fighting craft could get through when the Miran fleet was\r\nwithdrawn to some distance, but the Mirans were careful that no\r\nheavy-loaded freighter bearing power supply should get through.\r\n\r\nAnd Gresth Gkae waited off Luna in his great ship, and watched the\r\nsteady streams of magnetic bombs exploding on the magnetic shield of the\r\nLunar Fort. Presently more ships came up, and added their power to the\r\nattack, for here, the photo-cell banks could gather tremendous energy,\r\nand Gresth Gkae knew he would need to overcome this, and drain the\r\naccumulated power.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae felt certain if he could once crack this nut, break down\r\nEarth, he would have the system. This was the home planet. If this fell,\r\nthen the two others would follow easily, despite the fact that the few\r\nforts on the innermost planet, Mercury, could gather energy from the sun\r\nat a rate greater than their ships could generate.\r\n\r\nIt took Kendall two weeks and three days to set up his preliminary\r\napparatus. They had power for perhaps four days more, thanks to the fact\r\nthat the long Lunar day had begun shortly after Gresth Gkae's impatient\r\nattack had started. Also, the \"S Doradus\" had brought in several hundred\r\ntons of charged mercury on each trip, though this was no great quantity\r\nindividually, it had mounted up in the ten trips she had made. The\r\n\"Cepheid,\" her sister ship, had gone along on seven of the trips, and\r\nadded to the total.\r\n\r\nBut at length the apparatus was set up. It was peculiar looking, and it\r\nemployed a great deal of power, nearly as much as a UV beam in fact.\r\nMcLaurin looked at it sceptically toward the last, and asked Buck: \"What\r\ndo you expect it to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" said Kendall sourly, \"uncertain. The result will be uncertainty\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nWhich, considering things, was a surprisingly accurate statement.\r\nKendall gave the exact answer. He meant to give an ironic comment. For\r\nthe mathematics had been perfectly correct, only Buck Kendall\r\nmisinterpreted the answer.\r\n\r\n\"I've followed the math with mechanism all the way through,\" he\r\nexplained, \"and I'm putting power into it. That's all I know. Somewhere,\r\nby the laws of cause and effect, this power _must_ show itself\r\nagain--despite what the damn math says.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in that, of course, Kendall was wrong. Because the laws of cause and\r\neffect didn't hold in what he was doing now.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to watch?\" he asked at length. \"I'm all set to try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I may as well.\" McLaurin smiled. \"In our close-knit little\r\ncommunity the fate of one is of interest to all. If it's going to blow\r\nup, I might as well be here, and if it isn't, I want to be.\"\r\n\r\nKendall smiled appreciatively and replied: \"Let it be on thy own head.\r\nHere she goes.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the power board, and took command. Devin, and a squad\r\nof other scientists were seated about the room with every conceivable\r\ntype and combination of apparatus. Kendall wanted to see what this was\r\ndoing. \"Tubes,\" he called. \"Circuits A and D. Tie-ins.\" He stopped, the\r\npreliminary switches in. \"Main circuit coming.\" With a jerk he threw\r\nover the last contact. A heavy relay thudded solidly. The hum of a\r\nstraining atostor. Then--\r\n\r\nAn electric motor, humming smoothly stopped with a jerk. \"This,\" it\r\nremarked in a deep throaty voice, \"is probably the last stand of\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe galvanometer before which Devin was seated apparently agreed. In a\r\nrather high pitched voice it pointed out that: \"If the Lunar Fort falls,\r\nthe Earth--\" It stopped abruptly, and an electroscope beside Douglass\r\ntook up the thread in a high, shrill voice, rather slurred, \"--will be\r\ndirectly attacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" resumed the motor in a hoarse voice, \"will certainly mean the\r\nend of humanity.\" The motor gave up the discourse and hummed violently\r\ninto action--in reverse!\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" Kendall pulled the switch open with a sagging jaw and staring\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe men in the room burst into sudden startled exclamations.\r\n\r\nKendall didn't give them time. His jaw snapped shut, and a blazing light\r\nof wondrous joy shone in his eyes. He instantly threw the switch in\r\nagain. Again the humming atostor, the strain--\r\n\r\nSlowly Devin lifted from his seat. With thrashing arms and startled,\r\nstaring eyes, he drifted gently across the room. Abruptly he fell to the\r\nfloor, unhurt by the light Lunar gravity.\r\n\r\n\"I advise,\" said the motor in its grumbling voice, \"an immediate\r\nexodus.\" It stopped speaking, and practiced what it preached. It was a\r\nfifty-horse motor-generator, on a five-ton tungsten-beryllium base, but\r\nit rose abruptly, spun rapidly about an axis at right angles to the axis\r\nof its armature, and stopped as suddenly. In mid air it continued its\r\ninterrupted lecture. \"Mercury therefore is the destination I would\r\nadvise. There power is sufficient for--all machines.\" Gently it inverted\r\nitself and settled to the middle of the floor. Kendall instantly cut the\r\nswitch. The relay did not chunk open. It refused to obey. Settled in the\r\nmiddle of the floor now, torn loose from its power leads, the\r\nmotor-generator began turning. It turned faster and faster. It was\r\nshrilling in a thin scream of terrific speed, a speed that should have\r\ntorn its windings to fragments under the lash of centrifugal force.\r\nContentedly it said throatily. \"Settled.\"\r\n\r\nThe galvanometer spoke again in its peculiar harsh voice. \"Therefore,\r\nmove.\" Abruptly, without apparent reason, the stubborn relay clicked\r\nopen. The shrilly screaming motor stopped dead instantly, as though it\r\nhad had no real momentum, or had been inertialess.\r\n\r\nStartled, white-faced men looked at Kendall. Buck's eyes were shining\r\nwith an unholy glee.\r\n\r\n\"_Uncertainty!_\" he shouted. \"Uncertainty--uncertainty--uncertainty,\r\nyou fools! Don't you see it? All the math--it said uncertainty--man,\r\nman--_we've got just that--uncertainty_!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy,\" gasped McLaurin. \"I'm crazy, everything's gone crazy.\"\r\n\r\nKendall roared with sudden, joyous laughter. \"Absolutely. Everything\r\ngoes crazy--_the laws of nature break down_! Heisenberg's principle\r\nshowed that the law of cause and effect weren't absolute. We've made\r\nthem absolutely uncertain!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but motors _talking_, instruments giving lectures--\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--or rather uncertainly--anything, absolutely anything. The\r\ndestruction of the laws of gravity, freedom from inertia--why, merely\r\npicking up a radio lecture is nothing!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, abruptly, a thousand questions poured in on him. Jubilantly he\r\nanswered what he could, told what he thought--and then brought order.\r\n\"The battle's still on, men--we've still got to find out how to use\r\nthis, now we've got it. I have an idea--that there's a lot more. I know\r\nwhat I'll get this time. Now help me remake this apparatus so we don't\r\nbroadcast the thing.\"\r\n\r\nAt once, ten times the former pace, work was done. On the radio, news\r\nwas sent out that Kendall was on the right track after all. In two hours\r\nthe apparatus had been vastly altered, it was in the final stage, and an\r\nentirely different sort of field set up. Again they watched as Buck\r\napplied the power.\r\n\r\nThe atostor hummed--but no strange tricks of matter happened this time.\r\nThe more concentrated, altered field was, as Buck was to find out later,\r\n\"Uncertainty of the Second Degree.\" It was molecular uncertainty. In a\r\nfield a foot and a half in diameter, Buck saw the thing created--and\r\nsuddenly a brilliant green-blue flame shot up, and a great dark cloud of\r\nterrible, red-brown deadly vapor. Then an instant later, Kendall had\r\nopened the relay. Gasping, the men ran from the laboratory, shutting the\r\ndeadly fumes in. \"N{2}O{4}\" gasped Morton, the chemist, as they reached\r\nsafety. \"It's exothermic--but it formed there!\"\r\n\r\nIn that instant, Kendall grasped the meaning the choking fumes carried.\r\n\"Molecular uncertainty!\" he decided. \"We're going back--we're getting\r\nthere--\"\r\n\r\nHe altered the apparatus again, added another atostor in series, reduced\r\nthe size of his sphere of forces--of strange chaos of uncertainty.\r\nWithin--little was certain. Without--the laws of nature applied as ever.\r\n\r\nAgain the apparatus was started, cautiously this time. Only a strange\r\njumbled ionization appeared this time, then a slow, rising blue flame\r\nbegan to creep up, and burn hot and blue. Buck looked at it for a\r\nmoment, then his face grew tense and thoughtful. \"Devin--give me a\r\nhalf-dollar.\" Blankly, Devin reached in his pocket, and handed over the\r\nmetal disc. Cautiously Buck Kendall tossed it toward the sphere of\r\nforce. Instantly there was a flash of flame, soundless and soft-colored.\r\nThen the silver disc was outlined in light, and swiftly, inevitably\r\ncrumbling into dust so fine only a blue haze appeared. In less than two\r\nseconds, the metal was gone. Only the dense blue fog remained. Then this\r\nbegan to go, and the leaping blue flame grew taller, and stronger.\r\n\r\n\"We're on the track--I'm going to stop here, and calculate. Bring the\r\ndata--\"\r\n\r\nKendall shut off the machine, and went to the calculation room. Swiftly\r\nhe selected already prepared graphs, graphs of the math he had worked\r\non. Devin came soon, and others. They assembled the data and with tables\r\nand arithmetical machines turned it into graphs.\r\n\r\nThen all these graphs were fed into the machine. There were curves, and\r\nsine-curves, abrupt breaking lines--but the answer that came when all\r\nwere compounded was a perfect diagram of a flight of four steps,\r\ndescending in unequal treads to zero.\r\n\r\nKendall looked at it for long minutes. \"That,\" he said at length, \"is\r\nwhat I expected. There are four degrees of uncertainty, we generated\r\n'Uncertainty of the First Degree,' 'Mass Uncertainty,' when we started.\r\nThat, as here shown, takes little energy concentration. Then we\r\nincreased the energy concentration and got 'Uncertainty of the Second\r\nDegree,' 'Molecular Uncertainty.' Then I added more power, and reduced\r\nthe field, and got 'Uncertainty of the Third Degree'--'Atomic\r\nUncertainty.' There is 'Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree.' It is barely\r\nattainable with our atostors. It is--utter uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"In the First Degree, the laws of mass action fail, the great\r\nbroad-reaching laws. In the Second Degree, the laws of the molecules, a\r\nfiner organization, break down, and anything can happen in chemistry. In\r\nthe Third Degree, the laws of atomic physics break down slowly. The atom\r\nis tough. It is very compact, and we just barely attained the\r\nconcentration needed with that apparatus. But--in the Third Degree, when\r\nthe Atomic Laws break down into utter uncertainty, the atoms break, and\r\nonly hydrogen can exist. That was the blue flame.\r\n\r\n\"But the Fourth Degree--_there is no law whatsoever_, nothing in all the\r\nUniverse can exist. It means--_the utter destruction and release of the\r\nenergy of matter_!\" Kendall paused for a moment. \"We have won, with\r\nthis. We need only make up this apparatus--and maybe make it into a\r\nweapon. You know, in the Fourth Degree, nothing in all the Universe\r\ncould resist, deflect, or control it, if launched freely, and\r\nself-maintaining. I think that might be done. You see, no law affects\r\nit, for it breaks down the law. Magnetism cannot attract or repel it\r\nbecause magnetic fields cannot exist; there is no law of magnetic force,\r\nwhere this field is.\r\n\r\n\"And you know, Devin, how I have analyzed and duplicated their magnetic\r\nball-fields. This should be capable of formation into a ball-field.\r\n\r\n\"We need only make it up now. We will install it in the 'S Doradus' and\r\nthe 'Cepheid' as a weapon. We need only install it as an energy source\r\nhere. Let us start.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nBuck Kendall with a slow smile, looked out of the port in the thick\r\nmetal wall. The magnetic shield of the Lunar Fort was washed constantly\r\nwith the fires of exploding magnetic bombs. The smile spread broader.\r\n\"My friends,\" he said softly, \"you can pull from now till doomsday as\r\nfar as I'm concerned, and you won't even disturb us now.\" He looked back\r\nover his shoulder into the power room. A hunched bulk, beautifully\r\ndesigned and carefully finished, the apparatus that created 'Uncertainty\r\nof the Fourth Degree' was destroying matter, and creating by its\r\ndestruction terrific electric fields. These fields were feeding the\r\nmagnetic shield now. Under the present drain, the machine was not\r\nnoticeably working. In fact, Kendall was a bit annoyed. He had tested\r\nout the energy generating properties of this machine, trying to find a\r\nlimit. He had found there was no limit. The great copper conductors,\r\ncharged with the same atostor force that was used in the mercury fuel,\r\nwere perfect conductors, they had not heated. But the eleven thousand\r\ntons of discharged mercury metal had been completely charged in just a\r\nbit better than eleven minutes. The pumps wouldn't force it through the\r\ncharging apparatus any faster than that.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks more had passed, while the \"S Doradus\" and the \"Cepheid\" were\r\nfitted out with the new apparatus Buck had designed. They were almost\r\nready to start now.\r\n\r\nMcLaurin came down the corridor, and stopped near Kendall. He too smiled\r\nat the Miran's attempts. \"They've got a long way to go, Buck.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're going a long way. Clear back home--and we'll be right along. I\r\ndon't think they can outdistance us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still don't see why you couldn't use one of those Uncertainty\r\nconditions--the First Degree perhaps, and annihilate our inertia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't control Uncertainty. By its essential character it's beyond\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that Fourth Degree machine of yours--the material energy--if it\r\nisn't controlled and utilized Uncertainty?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's utter and utterly uncontrolled Uncertainty. The matter within that\r\nfield breaks down to absolutely nothing. Within, no law whatsoever\r\napplies, but fortunately, outside the old laws of physics apply--and we\r\ncan gather and use the energy which is released outside, though nothing\r\ncan be done inside. Why, think, man, if I could control that\r\nUncertainty, I could do anything at all, absolutely anything. It would\r\nbe a world as unreasonable as a bad dream. Think how unreasonable those\r\nmanifestations we first got were!\"\r\n\r\n\"But can't you get any control at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little. Anyway, if I could get inertialess conditions at will, I'd\r\nbe afraid of them. They'd make chemical reactions impossible in all\r\nprobability--and life is chemical. Two atoms must come into more or less\r\nviolent contact before a union takes place, and cannot if they have\r\nneither momentum nor inertia.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway--why worry. I can't do it, because I can't control this thing.\r\nAnd we have the extra-space drive.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does that darned thing work? Can't you drop the math and tell me\r\nabout it?\"\r\n\r\nKendall smiled. \"Not too readily. Remember first, as to the driving\r\nsystem, that it works on the fabric of space. Space is, in the physical\r\nsense, a fabric woven of the threads of lines of force from every body\r\nin the universe, made up of fields and forces. It is elastic, and can\r\ntransmit strains. But anything that can transmit strains, can be\r\nstrained against. With the tremendous field intensities available by the\r\nmaterial engines, I can get such fields as will 'dig their toes' into\r\nspace and push.\r\n\r\n\"That's the drive itself. It is accelerationless, because it enfolds us,\r\nand acts equally on every atom of us. By maintaining in addition a\r\nslight artificial gravity--thanks also to the intensity of those\r\nmaterial engine fields--we can be comfortable, while we accelerate at\r\ntremendous rates.\r\n\r\n\"That is, I think, at least allied to the Stranger's system. For the\r\nhigh-speed drive, I do in fact use the Uncertainty. I can control it in\r\na certain sense by determining its powers, and the limits of\r\nuncertainty, whether First, Second, Third or Fourth Degree. It advances\r\nin jumps--but on a finer plotting of the curve, you can see that each\r\njump represents a vast series of smaller jumps. That is, there is Class\r\nA, B, C, D, and so forth Uncertainty of the First Degree. Now Class A\r\nFirst Degree Uncertainty involves only the deepest, broadest principles.\r\nOnly they break down. One of these is the law of the speed of light.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure that isn't the system the Strangers use, but I'm also sure\r\nthere's no limit to the speed we can get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't that wreck your drive system?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, because gravity and the fields I use in driving are First Degree\r\nUncertainties of the higher classes.\r\n\r\n\"But at any rate, it will work. And--I suspect you came to say you were\r\nready to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\" McLaurin nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Still stick to your original plan?\"\r\n\r\nMcLaurin nodded. \"I think it's best. You follow those fellows back to\r\ntheir system in the 'S Doradus' and I'll stay here in the 'Cepheid' to\r\nprotect the system. They may need some time to get out of the place\r\nhere. And remember, we ought to be as decent as they were. They didn't\r\nbother the transports leaving Jupiter when they came in, only attacked\r\nthe warships. We're bound to do the same, but we'll have to keep a watch\r\non them, nonetheless. So you go on ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThey started down the corridor, and came presently to the huge locks\r\nwhere the \"S Doradus\" and the \"Cepheid\" were berthed. The super-ships\r\nlay cold and gray now, men swarming in and out with last-minute\r\nsupplies. Air, water, spare parts, bedding and personal equipment.\r\nDouglass, Cole, and most of the laboratory staff would go with Kendall\r\nwhen he followed the Strangers home. Devin and a few of the most\r\nadvanced physicists would stay with McLaurin in case of need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later the \"S Doradus\" rose gently, soundlessly from her berth,\r\nand floated out of the open lock-door. The \"Cepheid\" followed her in\r\nfive seconds. Still under the great screen of the fort, the lashing,\r\ncoruscating colors of the magnetic bombs and the magnetic screen flashed\r\nand was iridescent. The \"S Doradus\" poked her great nose gently through\r\nthe screen, and an instant later her titanically powerful,\r\nmaterial-engine effortlessly discharged a great magnetic bomb, sent with\r\nthe combined power of five atomic-powered interstellar ships. The two\r\nships separated now, the \"Cepheid\" under McLaurin flashing ahead with\r\nsudden, terrific acceleration toward Mars, whispering through space at a\r\nspeed that made it undetectable, faster than light. The \"S Doradus\"\r\njourneyed out leisurely toward the fleet of forty-seven Miran ships.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae saw the \"S Doradus\" and as he watched the steady progress,\r\nfelt sudden fear at his heart. The ship seemed so certain--\r\n\r\nAt a distance of thirty thousand miles, Kendall stopped. Magnetic bombs\r\nwere washing his screen continuously now, seeking to exhaust the ship as\r\nall the great ships beyond poured their energy against it. A slow smile\r\nspread over Kendall's mouth as he heard the gentle hum of the barely\r\nworking material-engine. Carefully he aligned the nose UV beam of the \"S\r\nDoradus\" on the nearest of the Miran ships. Then he depressed a switch.\r\n\r\nThere was no ion-release before the force-mirror now. Just a jet of gas\r\nwhirling into a half-inch field of \"Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree.\"\r\nThe matter vanished instantly in released energy so stupendous that the\r\ngreatest previous UV beams had been harmless things by comparison.\r\nMaterial energy maintained the mirror forces. Material energy gave the\r\npower that was released. And only material energy could have stood up\r\nbefore it. Thirty thousand miles away, a Miran ship flamed\r\ninstantaneously into inconceivable incandescence, vanishing almost in\r\nblue-violet light of terrific intensity. The ship reeled away, a\r\nhalf-molten wreck.\r\n\r\nThe beam spotted two more ships before it winked out. Then Kendall began\r\nsending bombs. He moved up to within 2000 miles that his aim might be\r\naccurate. They were bombs of \"Uncertainty of the Third Degree,\" the\r\nUncertainty of atomic law in bomb form. One hit the nose of the nearest\r\nship, and a sphere five feet in diameter glowed mistily blue for a\r\nmoment. Then very easily, the matter that formed the wall of the cruiser\r\nbegan to run and change, and presently there was only a hole, and an\r\nexpanding cloud of gas. Three more flowed toward it--and the hole\r\nenlarged, and another hole appeared in a bulkhead behind.\r\n\r\nKendall made a change. For the first time there came the staccato bark\r\nof the material engine under strain, as it fashioned the terrific fields\r\nof \"Uncertainty of the Ultimate Degree.\" Abruptly they leapt out,\r\ninvisible till they entered a magnetic screen, then run over with\r\nopalescent light as the energy of the field was sucked into them and\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nIt struck the nose of a ship--a field no larger than an apple--\r\n\r\nA titanic gout of energy burst out that was soundless in space. The ship\r\nsuddenly opened back, opened like the peel of a banana, till a little\r\nnub remained at the further end, and the metal flaps dropped back across\r\nand behind it dejectedly. A second ship was struck, and it was struck on\r\none side, so that it was shattered like a spent firecracker.\r\n\r\nThen the Miran fleet vanished in speed.\r\n\r\nKendall followed them. \"I think,\" he said with a grin, \"they tried to\r\nuse their radio beam, but it spread too much to do anything at that\r\ndistance. And they used their rotating magnetic field, which we couldn't\r\nfeel. And their crumbler ray too, of course. I wonder--are they headed\r\nonly for Jupiter? No--no, they've passed it!\"\r\n\r\nFaster than light, faster than energy could follow through space, or\r\nUncertainty Bombs pursue, the Mirans were fleeing for home. They knew\r\nnow that only in speed lay safety. Already they knew that a similar ship\r\nhad appeared off Jupiter, and, after wiping out the Phobos and Mars\r\nstations with one bomb each, had cleared the Jovian Satellites with\r\nequal terrible efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn one of the fleeing ships was a broken, tired old man, and his staff.\r\nGresth Gkae looked back at the blank, distorted space behind them, at\r\nthe swiftly dwindling sun, and spoke. \"I was at fault, my friends. Jarth\r\nhas spoken. _They_ are the stronger and the wiser race. Farth Skalt has\r\nshown you--they use space fields of intensity 100. That means the energy\r\nof the ultimate destruction. Jarth used us as his instrument of testing,\r\nonly to drive and stimulate that race. I do not--nay. There is no doubt\r\nnow, for look.\"\r\n\r\nPlainly visible, rapidly overtaking them, the \"S Doradus\" appeared\r\nsharp, and luminous on the jet of distorted space.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot escape, my friends. Shall we return to Sthor or remain in\r\nspace, lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us deflect our course--at least he may not know our destination.\"\r\nThe interstellar ship turned very slightly in her course. Plainly they\r\nsaw the \"S Doradus\" flash on, in a straight line, headed for distant,\r\nred-glowing Mira. Gresth Gkae watched, and shrugged. Silently he put the\r\nship back on its course, at its utmost speed. Parallel with them, near\r\nto them, the \"S Doradus\" flashed on. Day after day, the two hurled\r\nthrough space faster than light. Gradually Mira brightened, and at last\r\nbecame a disc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae slowed his ships, and Kendall, watching, slowed to match his\r\nspeed. Five billion miles from Sthor, they had reached normal space\r\nspeeds. Viciously the Miran fleet attacked the lone ship from Earth.\r\nTheir rays, their bombs, their every weapon was flaming. Great\r\ninterstellar ships flashed suddenly into speeds greater than that of\r\nlight, seeking to ram and destroy the smaller ship. The \"S Doradus\"\r\nflashed into equal or greater speed, and eluded them.\r\n\r\nKendall had determined now, which was the leader's ship.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae watched dully as his ships attempted to destroy the single,\r\nsmall ship. He sighed in resignation, and turned to walk back to the\r\nchapel aboard the ship. One last prayer to Jarth--\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae stopped abruptly. The great ship was lurching strangely. Men\r\nshouted sudden, frightened cries. The clanking and thud of relays\r\nsounded, the shrill of alarms. Then the alarms stopped, and suddenly the\r\nwhole great ship vibrated to an infinitely deep voice speaking in\r\nperfect Sthorian. The voice remarked solemnly, in great, vibrant tones,\r\nthat they would certainly receive news presently from the Expeditions.\r\nIt went on for some seconds to discuss the conditions as reported in the\r\nnew system. Then it stopped abruptly. An electric motor just above\r\nGresth Gkae's head suddenly hummed into action without reason or power\r\nconnection. Almost simultaneously he heard the shouts of startled men as\r\nthe great lock doors began to open into space of their own accord,\r\nbulkhead doors slipped shut as the roar of escaping air echoed in the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThen it was all over. Gresth Gkae ran to the control room. The Mirans\r\nthere looked up at him with drawn faces.\r\n\r\n\"The instruments--Gresth Gkae--the instruments. The instruments read\r\nimpossible things, the motors worked without reason, the fields\r\nfluctuated--the atomic engines stopped and the magnetic shield broke\r\ndown and gripped part of the ship instead!\" reported the bewildered\r\npilot.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know--some strange weapon of--\" began the old scientist.\r\nSomething luminous and huge twisted suddenly through space toward them,\r\na bomb of \"Uncertainty of the First Degree.\" It wrapped the ship\r\nsilently--and again strange things happened. Abruptly the ship started\r\nwhirling violently, yet without centrifugal force. The heavens wheeled\r\ncrazily, and turned about three axes simultaneously. There was no\r\ngyroscopic effect to hold them!\r\n\r\nGradually the thing died out. Then a great field seemed to catch the\r\nship, and hurl it away from its companions. Abruptly the pilot applied\r\nall his power to pull free. In vain.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae shook his head slowly, and raised the pilot's hands from the\r\nboard. \"Let them do as they will. I think they mean us no real harm,\r\nThart Kralt. They can, we know, destroy us in an instant. Perhaps he\r\nwants us to go somewhere with him\"--Gresth Gkae smiled sadly--\"and\r\nanyway, we can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly a billion miles the great ship was hurled through space at\r\ntremendous normal-space velocity. Then abruptly it was halted, without a\r\nsign of strain or hurt. The great twenty-foot UV beam on the nose of the\r\n\"S Doradus\" broke into glowing gentle red light. It flashed twice. There\r\nwas a pause. Then it flashed four times. A long wait. Then three times,\r\na pause and nine times. A wait. Four times, a pause, sixteen times. Then\r\nit stopped.\r\n\r\nA slow smile of ineffable joy spread over Gresth Gkae's face. \"Jarth Be\r\nPraised. He can destroy, but does not wish to. Ah, Thart Kralt, turn\r\nyour spotlight toward him, and flash it twenty-five times, for he is\r\ntrying to start communications with us. Jarth is wise beyond all\r\nunderstanding. They were the weaker race, and they are the stronger. But\r\nalso they are the better, for they could destroy, and they do not, but\r\nseek only to communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interstellar liner \"Mirasol\" settled gently to Sthor, having circled\r\nwide of Asthor, and from her hold a cargo of the heavy Jovian elements\r\nwas discharged, while a mixed stream of Solarians and Mirans came from\r\nher passenger quarters.\r\n\r\nA delegation of Mirans met the new Ambassador from Sol, Commander\r\nMcLaurin, and conducted him joyfully to the Central Government Group.\r\nBeside the great buildings, a battered, scarred interstellar ship lay,\r\nher rear section a mass of great patches, rudely applied, and rudely\r\nmade, mere cast metal plates.\r\n\r\nGresth Gkae welcomed Commander McLaurin to the Government Hall. \"Your\r\narrival today, Commander McLaurin, was most fortunate,\" he said in the\r\ninterstellar language that had been developed, \"for but yesterday Gresth\r\nTalak, my brother, arrived in his ship. Before we made that\r\nfortunate-unfortunate expedition against your system, we waited for him,\r\nand he did not come, so we knew his ship had, like others, been lost.\r\n\r\n\"He arrived only yesterday, some seventy hours ago, and explained how it\r\nhad come about. He too found a solar system. But he was less fortunate\r\nthan I, and while exploring this uninhabited system, far out still from\r\nthe central sun, where there should have been no masses of matter, one\r\nof those rare things, a giant stony meteor that even a magnetic shield\r\nwill not stop careened into the rear of his ship. Damaged badly, barely\r\nable to move, they settled to a planet. The atmosphere was breathable,\r\nthe temperature mild. But while they could navigate planetary\r\ndistances, they could not return, so for nearly four and a half of your\r\nyears they remained there, working, working to repair their ship.\r\n\r\n\"They have done it at last. And they have returned. And best of all,\r\nafter a four-year stay there, they know all they need know about that\r\nsystem of eleven planets. It is compact as yours, with an ultra-light\r\nsun such as yours, and four of the planets are habitable. Together we\r\ncan colonize that system! It is a system of stable heat and stable\r\nlight. And it is small, yet large enough. And with the devices such as\r\nyour new energy has permitted, we need never fear the stony meteors\r\nagain.\" Gresth Gkae smiled happily. \"Still better--it is inhabited only\r\nby the lowest forms of life. It is too costly to both races when Jarth\r\nsees fit to stimulate them by throwing one against the other, despite\r\nthe good things that may come later.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Ultimate Weapon, by John Wood Campbell",
