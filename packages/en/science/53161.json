For his philosophy operations of nature, which for so many\r\nages had imployed the curiosity of mankind; though no one before him\r\nwas furnished with the strength of mind necessary to go any depth in\r\nthis difficult search. However, I am encouraged to hope, that this\r\nattempt, imperfect as it is, to give our countrymen in general some\r\nconception of the labours of a person, who shall always be the boast\r\nof this nation, may be received with indulgence by one, under whose\r\ninfluence these kingdoms enjoy so much happiness. Indeed my admiration\r\nat the surprizing inventions of this great man, carries me to conceive\r\nof him as a person, who not only must raise the glory of the country,\r\nwhich gave him birth; but that he has even done honour to human nature,\r\nby having extended the greatest and most noble of our faculties,\r\nreason, to subjects, which, till he attempted them, appeared to be\r\nwholly beyond the reach of our limited capacities. And what can give us\r\na more pleasing prospect of our own condition, than to see so exalted\r\na proof of the strength of that faculty, whereon the conduct of our\r\nlives, and our happiness depends; our passions and all our motives to\r\naction being in such manner guided by our opinions, that where these\r\nare just, our whole behaviour will be praise-worthy? But why do I\r\npresume to detain you, SIR, with such reflections as these, who must\r\nhave the fullest experience within your own mind, of the effects of\r\nright reason? For to what other source can be ascribed that amiable\r\nfrankness and unreserved condescension among your friends, or that\r\nmasculine perspicuity and strength of argument, whereby you draw the\r\nadmiration of the publick, while you are engaged in the most important\r\nof all causes, the liberties of mankind?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI humbly crave leave to make the only acknowledgement within my power,\r\nfor the benefits, which I receive in common with the rest of my\r\ncountrymen from these high talents, by subscribing my self\r\n\r\n  ~_SIR_~,\r\n  _Your most faithful_,\r\n  _and_\r\n  _Most humble Servant_,\r\n\r\n  ~HENRY PEMBERTON~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~PREFACE~.\r\n\r\n\r\nI _Drew up the following papers many years ago at the desire of some\r\nfriends, who, upon my taking care of the late edition of Sir_ ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON’S~ _Principia, perswaded me to make them publick. I laid hold\r\nof that opportunity, when my thoughts were afresh employed on this\r\nsubject, to revise what I had formerly written. And I now send it\r\nabroad not without some hopes of answering these two ends. My first\r\nintention was to convey to such, as are not used to mathematical\r\nreasoning, some idea of the philosophy of a person, who has acquired\r\nan universal reputation, and rendered our nation famous for these\r\nspeculations in the learned world. To which purpose I have avoided\r\nusing terms of art as much as possible, and taken care to define such\r\nas I was obliged to use. Though this caution was the less necessary at\r\npresent, since many of them are become familiar words to our language,\r\nfrom the great number of books wrote in it upon philosophical subjects,\r\nand the courses of experiments, that have of late years been given by\r\nseveral ingenious men. The other view I had, was to encourage such\r\nyoung gentlemen as have a turn for the mathematical sciences, to pursue\r\nthose studies the more chearfully, in order to understand in our\r\nauthor himself the demonstrations of the things I here declare. And to\r\nfacilitate their progress herein, I intend to proceed still farther in\r\nthe explanation of Sir_ ~ISAAC NEWTON’S~ _philosophy. For as I have\r\nreceived very much pleasure from perusing his writings, I hope it is\r\nno illaudable ambition to endeavour the rendering them more easily\r\nunderstood, that greater numbers may enjoy the same satisfaction._\r\n\r\n_It will perhaps be expected, that I should say something particular\r\nof a person, to whom I must always acknowledge my self to be much\r\nobliged. What I have to declare on this head will be but short; for\r\nit was in the very last years of Sir_ ~ISAAC~_’s life, that I had the\r\nhonour of his acquaintance. This happened on the following occasion.\r\nMr._ Polenus, _a Professor in the University of_ Padua, _from a\r\nnew experiment of his, thought the common opinion about the force\r\nof moving bodies was overturned, and the truth of Mr._ Libnitz_’s\r\nnotion in that matter fully proved. The contrary of what Polenus had\r\nasserted I demonstrated in a paper, which Dr._ ~MEAD~, _who takes all\r\nopportunities of obliging his friends, was pleased to shew Sir_ ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ _This was so well approved of by him, that he did me the honour\r\nto become a fellow-writer with me, by annexing to what I had written,\r\na demonstration of his own drawn from another consideration. When I\r\nprinted my discourse in the philosophical transactions, I put what Sir_\r\n~ISAAC~ _had written in a scholium by it self, that I might not seem to\r\nusurp what did not belong to me. But I concealed his name, not being\r\nthen sufficiently acquainted with him to ask whether he was willing\r\nI might make use of it or not. In a little time after he engaged me\r\nto take care of the new edition he was about making if his Principia.\r\nThis obliged me to be very frequently with him, and as he lived at some\r\ndistance from me, a great number of letters passed between us on this\r\naccount. When I had the honour of his conversation, I endeavoured to\r\nlearn his thoughts upon mathematical subjects, and something historical\r\nconcerning his inventions, that I had not been before acquainted\r\nwith. I found, he had read fewer of the modern mathematicians, than\r\none could have expected; but his own prodigious invention readily\r\nsupplied him with what he might have an occasion for in the pursuit of\r\nany subject he undertook. I have often heard him censure the handling\r\ngeometrical subjects by algebraic calculations; and his book of Algebra\r\nhe called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition to the\r\ninjudicious title of Geometry, which_ Des Cartes _had given to the\r\ntreatise, wherein he shews, how the geometer may assist his invention\r\nby such kind of computations. He frequently praised_ Slusius, Barrow\r\n_and_ Huygens _for not being influenced by the false taste, which then\r\nbegan to prevail. He used to commend the laudable attempt of_ Hugo\r\nde Omerique _to restore the ancient analysis, and very much esteemed\r\nApollonius’s book De sectione rationis for giving us a clearer notion\r\nof that analysis than we had before. Dr._ Barrow _may be esteemed as\r\nhaving shewn a compass of invention equal, if not superior to any of\r\nthe moderns, our author only excepted; but Sir_ ~ISAAC NEWTON~ _has\r\nseveral times particularly recommended to me_ Huygens_’s stile and\r\nmanner. He thought him the most elegant of any mathematical writer of\r\nmodern times, and the most just imitator of the antients. Of their\r\ntaste, and form of demonstration Sir_ ~ISAAC~ _always professed\r\nhimself a great admirer: I have heard him even censure himself for\r\nnot following them yet more closely than he did; and speak with\r\nregret of his mistake at the beginning of his mathematical studies,\r\nin applying himself to the works of_ Des Cartes _and other algebraic\r\nwriters, before he had considered the elements of_ Euclide _with that\r\nattention, which so excellent a writer deserves. As to the history\r\nof his inventions, what relates to his discoveries of the methods of\r\nseries and fluxions, and of his theory of light and colours, the world\r\nhas been sufficiently informed of already. The first thoughts, which\r\ngave rise to his Principia, he had, when he retired from_ Cambridge\r\n_in 1666 on account of the plague. As he sat alone in a garden, he\r\nfell into a speculation on the power of gravity: that as this power\r\nis not found sensibly diminished at the remotest distance from the\r\ncenter of the earth, to which we can rise, neither at the tops of the\r\nloftiest buildings, nor even on the summits of the highest mountains;\r\nit appeared to him reasonable to conclude, that this power must extend\r\nmuch farther than was usually thought; why not as high as the moon,\r\nsaid he to himself? and if so, her motion must be influenced by it;\r\nperhaps she is retained in her orbit thereby. However, though the power\r\nof gravity is not sensibly weakened in the little change of distance,\r\nat which we can place our selves from the center of the earth; yet it\r\nis very possible, that so high as the moon this power may differ much\r\nin strength from what it is here. To make an estimate, what might be\r\nthe degree of this diminution, he considered with himself, that if the\r\nmoon be retained in her orbit by the force of gravity, no doubt the\r\nprimary planets are carried round the sun by the like power. And by\r\ncomparing the periods of the several planets with their distances from\r\nthe sun, he found, that if any power like gravity held them in their\r\ncourses, its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the\r\nincrease of distance. This be concluded by supposing them to move in\r\nperfect circles concentrical to the sun, from which the orbits of the\r\ngreatest part of them do not much differ. Supposing therefore the power\r\nof gravity, when extended to the moon, to decrease in the same manner,\r\nhe computed whether that force would be sufficient to keep the moon\r\nin her orbit. In this computation, being absent from books, he took\r\nthe common estimate in use among geographers and our seamen, before_\r\nNorwood _had measured the earth, that 60 English miles were contained\r\nin one degree of latitude on the surface of the earth. But as this is\r\na very faulty supposition, each degree containing about 69½ of our\r\nmiles, his computation did not answer expectation; whence he concluded,\r\nthat some other cause must at least join with the action of the power\r\nof gravity on the moon. On this account he laid aside for that time\r\nany farther thoughts upon this matter. But some years after, a letter\r\nwhich he received from Dr._ Hook, _put him on inquiring what was the\r\nreal figure, in which a body let fall from any high place descends,\r\ntaking the motion of the earth round its axis into consideration.\r\nSuch a body, having the same motion, which by the revolution of the\r\nearth the place has whence it falls, is to be considered as projected\r\nforward and at the same time drawn down to the center of the earth.\r\nThis gave occasion to his resuming his former thoughts concerning the\r\nmoon; and_ Picart _in_ France _having lately measured the earth, by\r\nusing his measures the moon appeared to be kept in her orbit purely by\r\nthe power of gravity; and consequently, that this power decreases as\r\nyou recede from the center of the earth in the manner our author had\r\nformerly conjectured. Upon this principle he found the line described\r\nby a falling body to be an ellipsis, the center of the earth being one\r\nfocus. And the primary planets moving in such orbits round the sun, he\r\nhad the satisfaction to see, that this inquiry, which he had undertaken\r\nmerely out of curiosity, could be applied to the greatest purposes.\r\nHereupon he composed near a dozen propositions relating to the motion\r\nof the primary planets about the sun. Several years after this, some\r\ndiscourse he had with Dr._ Halley, _who at Cambridge made him a\r\nvisit, engaged Sir_ ~ISAAC NEWTON~ _to resume again the consideration\r\nof this subject; and gave occasion to his writing the treatise\r\nwhich he published under the title of mathematical principles of\r\nnatural philosophy. This treatise, full of such a variety of profound\r\ninventions, was composed by him from scarce any other materials than\r\nthe few propositions before mentioned, in the space of one year and an\r\nhalf._\r\n\r\n_Though his memory was much decayed, I found he perfectly understood\r\nhis own writings, contrary to what I had frequently heard in discourse\r\nfrom many persons. This opinion of theirs might arise perhaps from his\r\nnot being always ready at speaking on these subjects, when it might\r\nbe expected he should. But as to this, it may be observed, that great\r\ngenius’s are frequently liable to be absent, not only in relation to\r\ncommon life, but with regard to some of the parts of science they are\r\nthe best informed of. Inventors seem to treasure up in their minds,\r\nwhat they have found out, after another manner than those do the same\r\nthings, who have not this inventive faculty. The former, when they\r\nhave occasion to produce their knowledge, are in some measure obliged\r\nimmediately to investigate part of what they want. For this they are\r\nnot equally fit at all times: so it has often happened, that such as\r\nretain things chiefly by means of a very strong memory, have appeared\r\noff hand more expert than the discoverers themselves._\r\n\r\n_As to the moral endowments of his mind, they were as much to be\r\nadmired as his other talents. But this is a field I leave others to\r\nexspatiate in. I only touch upon what I experienced myself during\r\nthe few years I was happy in his friendship. But this I immediately\r\ndiscovered in him, which at once both surprized and charmed me: Neither\r\nhis extreme great age, nor his universal reputation had rendred him\r\nstiff in opinion, or in any degree elated. Of this I had occasion\r\nto have almost daily experience. The Remarks I continually sent him\r\nby letters on his Principia were received with the utmost goodness.\r\nThese were so far from being any ways displeasing to him, that on\r\nthe contrary it occasioned him to speak many kind things of me to my\r\nfriends, and to honour me with a publick testimony of his good opinion.\r\nHe also approved of the following treatise, a great part of which we\r\nread together. As many alterations were made in the late edition of\r\nhis Principia, so there would have been many more if there had been\r\na sufficient time. But whatever of this kind may be thought wanting,\r\nI shall endeavour to supply in my comment on that book. I had reason\r\nto believe he expected such a thing from me, and I intended to have\r\npublished it in his life time, after I had printed the following\r\ndiscourse, and a mathematical treatise Sir_ ~ISAAC NEWTON~ _had written\r\na long while ago, containing the first principles of fluxions, for I\r\nhad prevailed on him to let that piece go abroad. I had examined all\r\nthe calculations, and prepared part of the figures; but as the latter\r\npart of the treatise had never been finished, he was about letting me\r\nhave other papers, in order to supply what was wanting. But his death\r\nput a stop to that design. As to my comment on the Principia, I intend\r\nthere to demonstrate whatever Sir_ ~ISAAC NEWTON~ _has set down without\r\nexpress proof, and to explain all such expressions in his book, as\r\nI shall judge necessary. This comment I shall forthwith put to the\r\npress, joined to an english translation of his Principia, which I have\r\nhad some time by me. A more particular account of my whole design has\r\nalready been published in the new memoirs of literature for the month\r\nof march 1727._\r\n\r\n_I have presented my readers with a copy of verses on Sir_ ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~, _which I have just received from a young Gentleman, whom I am\r\nproud to reckon among the number of my dearest friends. If I had any\r\napprehension that this piece of poetry stood in need of an apology,\r\nI should be desirous the reader might know, that the author is but\r\nsixteen years old, and was obliged to finish his composition in a very\r\nshort space of time. But I shall only take the liberty to observe, that\r\nthe boldness of the digressions will be best judged of by those who are\r\nacquainted with_ ~PINDAR~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n                                ~POEM~\r\n                                  ON\r\n                         Sir ~_ISAAC NEWTON_~.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO ~NEWTON~’s genius, and immortal fame\r\n  Th’ advent’rous muse with trembling pinion soars.\r\n  Thou, heav’nly truth, from thy seraphick throne\r\n  Look favourable down, do thou assist\r\n  My lab’ring thought, do thou inspire my song.\r\n  NEWTON, who first th’ almighty’s works display’d,\r\n  And smooth’d that mirror, in whose polish’d face\r\n  The great creator now conspicuous shines;\r\n  Who open’d nature’s adamantine gates,\r\n  And to our minds her secret powers expos’d;\r\n  NEWTON demands the muse; his sacred hand\r\n  Shall guide her infant steps; his sacred hand\r\n  Shall raise her to the Heliconian height,\r\n  Where, on its lofty top inthron’d, her head\r\n  Shall mingle with the Stars. Hail nature, hail,\r\n  O Goddess, handmaid of th’ ethereal power,\r\n  Now lift thy head, and to th’ admiring world\r\n  Shew thy long hidden beauty. Thee the wise\r\n  Of ancient fame, immortal ~PLATO~’s self,\r\n  The Stagyrite, and Syracusian sage,\r\n  From black obscurity’s abyss to raise,\r\n  (Drooping and mourning o’er thy wondrous works)\r\n  With vain inquiry sought. Like meteors these\r\n  In their dark age bright sons of wisdom shone:\r\n  But at thy ~NEWTON~ all their laurels fade,\r\n  They shrink from all the honours of their names.\r\n  So glimm’ring stars contract their feeble rays,\r\n  When the swift lustre of ~AURORA~’s face\r\n  Flows o’er the skies, and wraps the heav’ns in light.\r\n\r\n  THE Deity’s omnipotence, the cause,\r\n  Th’ original of things long lay unknown.\r\n  Alone the beauties prominent to sight\r\n  (Of the celestial power the outward form)\r\n  Drew praise and wonder from the gazing world.\r\n  As when the deluge overspread the earth,\r\n  Whilst yet the mountains only rear’d their heads\r\n  Above the surface of the wild expanse,\r\n  Whelm’d deep below the great foundations lay,\r\n  Till some kind angel at heav’n’s high command\r\n  Roul’d back the rising tides, and haughty floods,\r\n  And to the ocean thunder’d out his voice:\r\n  Quick all the swelling and imperious waves,\r\n  The foaming billows and obscuring surge,\r\n  Back to their channels and their ancient seats\r\n  Recoil affrighted: from the darksome main\r\n  Earth raises smiling, as new-born, her head,\r\n  And with fresh charms her lovely face arrays.\r\n  So his extensive thought accomplish’d first\r\n  The mighty task to drive th’ obstructing mists\r\n  Of ignorance away, beneath whose gloom\r\n  Th’ inshrouded majesty of Nature lay.\r\n  He drew the veil and swell’d the spreading scene.\r\n  How had the moon around th’ ethereal void\r\n  Rang’d, and eluded lab’ring mortals care,\r\n  Till his invention trac’d her secret steps,\r\n  While she inconstant with unsteady rein\r\n  Through endless mazes and meanders guides\r\n  In its unequal course her changing carr:\r\n  Whether behind the sun’s superior light\r\n  She hides the beauties of her radiant face,\r\n  Or, when conspicuous, smiles upon mankind,\r\n  Unveiling all her night-rejoicing charms.\r\n  When thus the silver-tressed moon dispels\r\n  The frowning horrors from the brow of night,\r\n  And with her splendors chears the sullen gloom,\r\n  While sable-mantled darkness with his veil\r\n  The visage of the fair horizon shades,\r\n  And over nature spreads his raven wings;\r\n  Let me upon some unfrequented green\r\n  While sleep sits heavy on the drowsy world,\r\n  Seek out some solitary peaceful cell,\r\n  Where darksome woods around their gloomy brows\r\n  Bow low, and ev’ry hill’s protended shade\r\n  Obscures the dusky vale, there silent dwell,\r\n  Where contemplation holds its still abode,\r\n  There trace the wide and pathless void of heav’n,\r\n  And count the stars that sparkle on its robe.\r\n  Or else in fancy’s wild’ring mazes lost\r\n  Upon the verdure see the fairy elves\r\n  Dance o’er their magick circles, or behold,\r\n  In thought enraptur’d with the ancient bards,\r\n  Medea’s baleful incantations draw\r\n  Down from her orb the paly queen of night.\r\n  But chiefly ~NEWTON~ let me soar with thee,\r\n  And while surveying all yon starry vault\r\n  With admiration I attentive gaze,\r\n  Thou shalt descend from thy celestial seat,\r\n  And waft aloft my high-aspiring mind,\r\n  Shalt shew me there how nature has ordain’d\r\n  Her fundamental laws, shalt lead my thought\r\n  Through all the wand’rings of th’ uncertain moon,\r\n  And teach me all her operating powers.\r\n  She and the sun with influence conjoint\r\n  Wield the huge axle of the whirling earth,\r\n  And from their just direction turn the poles,\r\n  Slow urging on the progress of the years.\r\n  The constellations seem to leave their seats,\r\n  And o’er the skies with solemn pace to move.\r\n  You, splendid rulers of the day and night,\r\n  The seas obey, at your resistless sway\r\n  Now they contract their waters, and expose\r\n  The dreary desart of old ocean’s reign.\r\n  The craggy rocks their horrid sides disclose;\r\n  Trembling the sailor views the dreadful scene,\r\n  And cautiously the threat’ning ruin shuns.\r\n  But where the shallow waters hide the sands,\r\n  There ravenous destruction lurks conceal’d,\r\n  There the ill-guided vessel falls a prey,\r\n  And all her numbers gorge his greedy jaws.\r\n  But quick returning see th’ impetuous tides\r\n  Back to th’ abandon’d shores impell the main.\r\n  Again the foaming seas extend their waves,\r\n  Again the rouling floods embrace the shoars,\r\n  And veil the horrours of the empty deep.\r\n  Thus the obsequious seas your power confess,\r\n  While from the surface healthful vapours rise\r\n  Plenteous throughout the atmosphere diffus’d,\r\n  Or to supply the mountain’s heads with springs,\r\n  Or fill the hanging clouds with needful rains,\r\n  That friendly streams, and kind refreshing show’rs\r\n  May gently lave the sun-burnt thirsty plains,\r\n  Or to replenish all the empty air\r\n  With wholsome moisture to increase the fruits\r\n  Of earth, and bless the labours of mankind.\r\n  O ~NEWTON~, whether flies thy mighty soul,\r\n  How shall the feeble muse pursue through all\r\n  The vast extent of thy unbounded thought,\r\n  That even seeks th’ unseen recesses dark\r\n  To penetrate of providence immense.\r\n  And thou the great dispenser of the world\r\n  Propitious, who with inspiration taught’st\r\n  Our greatest bard to send thy praises forth;\r\n  Thou, who gav’st ~NEWTON~ thought; who smil’dst serene,\r\n  When to its bounds he stretch’d his swelling soul;\r\n  Who still benignant ever blest his toil,\r\n  And deign’d to his enlight’ned mind t’ appear\r\n  Confess’d around th’ interminated world:\r\n  To me O thy divine infusion grant\r\n  (O thou in all so infinitely good)\r\n  That I may sing thy everlasting works,\r\n  Thy inexhausted store of providence,\r\n  In thought effulgent and resounding verse.\r\n  O could I spread the wond’rous theme around,\r\n  Where the wind cools the oriental world,\r\n  To the calm breezes of the Zephir’s breath,\r\n  To where the frozen hyperborean blasts.\r\n  To where the boist’rous tempest-leading south\r\n  From their deep hollow caves send forth their storms.\r\n  Thou still indulgent parent of mankind,\r\n  Left humid emanations should no more\r\n  Flow from the ocean, but dissolve away\r\n  Through the long series of revolving time;\r\n  And left the vital principle decay,\r\n  By which the air supplies the springs of life;\r\n  Thou hast the fiery visag’d comets form’d\r\n  With vivifying spirits all replete,\r\n  Which they abundant breathe about the void,\r\n  Renewing the prolifick soul of things.\r\n  No longer now on thee amaz’d we call,\r\n  No longer tremble at imagin’d ills,\r\n  When comets blaze tremendous from on high,\r\n  Or when extending wide their flaming trains\r\n  With hideous grasp the skies engirdle round,\r\n  And spread the terrors of their burning locks.\r\n  For these through orbits in the length’ning space\r\n  Of many tedious rouling years compleat\r\n  Around the sun move regularly on;\r\n  And with the planets in harmonious orbs,\r\n  And mystick periods their obeysance pay\r\n  To him majestick ruler of the skies\r\n  Upon his throne of circled glory fixt.\r\n  He or some god conspicuous to the view,\r\n  Or else the substitute of nature seems,\r\n  Guiding the courses of revolving worlds.\r\n  He taught great ~NEWTON~ the all-potent laws\r\n  Of gravitation, by whose simple power\r\n  The universe exists. Nor here the sage\r\n  Big with invention still renewing staid.\r\n  But O bright angel of the lamp of day,\r\n  How shall the muse display his greatest toil?\r\n  Let her plunge deep in Aganippe’s waves,\r\n  Or in Castalia’s ever-flowing stream,\r\n  That re-inspired she may sing to thee,\r\n  How ~NEWTON~ dar’d advent’rous to unbraid\r\n  The yellow tresses of thy shining hair.\r\n  Or didst thou gracious leave thy radiant sphere,\r\n  And to his hand thy lucid splendours give,\r\n  T’ unweave the light-diffusing wreath, and part\r\n  The blended glories of thy golden plumes?\r\n  He with laborious, and unerring care,\r\n  How different and imbodied colours form\r\n  Thy piercing light, with just distinction found.\r\n  He with quick sight pursu’d thy darting rays,\r\n  When penetrating to th’ obscure recess\r\n  Of solid matter, there perspicuous saw,\r\n  How in the texture of each body lay\r\n  The power that separates the different beams.\r\n  Hence over nature’s unadorned face\r\n  Thy bright diversifying rays dilate\r\n  Their various hues: and hence when vernal rains\r\n  Descending swift have burst the low’ring clouds,\r\n  Thy splendors through the dissipating mists\r\n  In its fair vesture of unnumber’d hues\r\n  Array the show’ry bow. At thy approach\r\n  The morning risen from her pearly couch\r\n  With rosy blushes decks her virgin cheek;\r\n  The ev’ning on the frontispiece of heav’n\r\n  His mantle spreads with many colours gay;\r\n  The mid-day skies in radiant azure clad,\r\n  The shining clouds, and silver vapours rob’d\r\n  In white transparent intermixt with gold,\r\n  With bright variety of splendor cloath\r\n  All the illuminated face above.\r\n  When hoary-headed winter back retires\r\n  To the chill’d pole, there solitary sits\r\n  Encompass’d round with winds and tempests bleak\r\n  In caverns of impenetrable ice,\r\n  And from behind the dissipated gloom\r\n  Like a new Venus from the parting surge\r\n  The gay-apparell’d spring advances on;\r\n  When thou in thy meridian brightness sitt’st,\r\n  And from thy throne pure emanations flow\r\n  Of glory bursting o’er the radiant skies:\r\n  Then let the muse Olympus’ top ascend,\r\n  And o’er Thessalia’s plain extend her view,\r\n  And count, O Tempe, all thy beauties o’er.\r\n  Mountains, whose summits grasp the pendant clouds,\r\n  Between their wood-invelop’d slopes embrace\r\n  The green-attired vallies. Every flow’r\r\n  Here in the pride of bounteous nature clad\r\n  Smiles on the bosom of th’ enamell’d meads.\r\n  Over the smiling lawn the silver floods\r\n  Of fair Peneus gently roul along,\r\n  While the reflected colours from the flow’rs,\r\n  And verdant borders pierce the lympid waves,\r\n  And paint with all their variegated hue\r\n  The yellow sands beneath. Smooth gliding on\r\n  The waters hasten to the neighbouring sea.\r\n  Still the pleas’d eye the floating plain pursues;\r\n  At length, in Neptune’s wide dominion lost,\r\n  Surveys the shining billows, that arise\r\n  Apparell’d each in Phœbus’ bright attire:\r\n  Or from a far some tall majestick ship,\r\n  Or the long hostile lines of threat’ning fleets,\r\n  Which o’er the bright uneven mirror sweep,\r\n  In dazling gold and waving purple deckt;\r\n  Such as of old, when haughty Athens power\r\n  Their hideous front, and terrible array\r\n  Against Pallene’s coast extended wide,\r\n  And with tremendous war and battel stern\r\n  The trembling walls of Potidæa shook.\r\n  Crested with pendants curling with the breeze\r\n  The upright masts high bristle in the air,\r\n  Aloft exalting proud their gilded heads.\r\n  The silver waves against the painted prows\r\n  Raise their resplendent bosoms, and impearl\r\n  The fair vermillion with their glist’ring drops:\r\n  And from on board the iron-cloathed host\r\n  Around the main a gleaming horrour casts;\r\n  Each flaming buckler like the mid-day sun,\r\n  Each plumed helmet like the silver moon,\r\n  Each moving gauntlet like the light’ning’s blaze,\r\n  And like a star each brazen pointed spear.\r\n  But lo the sacred high-erected fanes,\r\n  Fair citadels, and marble-crowned towers,\r\n  And sumptuous palaces of stately towns\r\n  Magnificent arise, upon their heads\r\n  Bearing on high a wreath of silver light.\r\n  But see my muse the high Pierian hill,\r\n  Behold its shaggy locks and airy top,\r\n  Up to the skies th’ imperious mountain heaves\r\n  The shining verdure of the nodding woods.\r\n  See where the silver Hippocrene flows,\r\n  Behold each glitt’ring rivulet, and rill\r\n  Through mazes wander down the green descent,\r\n  And sparkle through the interwoven trees.\r\n  Here rest a while and humble homage pay,\r\n  Here, where the sacred genius, that inspir’d\r\n  Sublime ~MÆONIDES~ and ~PINDAR’S~ breast,\r\n  His habitation once was fam’d to hold.\r\n  Here thou, O ~HOMER~, offer’dst up thy vows,\r\n  Thee, the kind muse ~CALLIOPÆA~ heard,\r\n  And led thee to the empyrean feats,\r\n  There manifested to thy hallow’d eyes\r\n  The deeds of gods; thee wise ~MINERVA~ taught\r\n  The wondrous art of knowing human kind;\r\n  Harmonious ~PHŒBUS~ tun’d thy heav’nly mind,\r\n  And swell’d to rapture each exalted sense;\r\n  Even ~MARS~ the dreadful battle-ruling god,\r\n  ~MARS~ taught thee war, and with his bloody hand\r\n  Instructed thine, when in thy sounding lines\r\n  We hear the rattling of Bellona’s carr,\r\n  The yell of discord, and the din of arms.\r\n  ~PINDAR~, when mounted on his fiery steed,\r\n  Soars to the sun, opposing eagle like\r\n  His eyes undazled to the fiercest rays.\r\n  He firmly seated, not like ~GLAUCUS’~ son,\r\n  Strides his swift-winged and fire-breathing horse,\r\n  And born aloft strikes with his ringing hoofs\r\n  The brazen vault of heav’n, superior there\r\n  Looks down upon the stars, whose radiant light\r\n  Illuminates innumerable worlds,\r\n  That through eternal orbits roul beneath.\r\n  But thou all hail immortalized son\r\n  Of harmony, all hail thou Thracian bard,\r\n  To whom ~APOLLO~ gave his tuneful lyre.\r\n  O might’st thou, ~ORPHEUS~, now again revive,\r\n  And ~NEWTON~ should inform thy list’ning ear\r\n  How the soft notes, and soul-inchanting strains\r\n  Of thy own lyre were on the wind convey’d.\r\n  He taught the muse, how sound progressive floats\r\n  Upon the waving particles of air,\r\n  When harmony in ever-pleasing strains,\r\n  Melodious melting at each lulling fall,\r\n  With soft alluring penetration steals\r\n  Through the enraptur’d ear to inmost thought,\r\n  And folds the senses in its silken bands.\r\n  So the sweet musick, which from ~ORPHEUS~’ touch\r\n  And fam’d ~AMPHION’S~, on the sounding string\r\n  Arose harmonious, gliding on the air,\r\n  Pierc’d the tough-bark’d and knotty-ribbed woods,\r\n  Into their saps soft inspiration breath’d\r\n  And taught attention to the stubborn oak.\r\n  Thus when great ~HENRY~, and brave ~MARLB’ROUGH~ led\r\n  Th’ imbattled numbers of ~BRITANNIA’S~ sons,\r\n  The trump, that swells th’ expanded cheek of fame,\r\n  That adds new vigour to the gen’rous youth,\r\n  And rouzes sluggish cowardize it self,\r\n  The trumpet with its Mars-inciting voice,\r\n  The winds broad breast impetuous sweeping o’er\r\n  Fill’d the big note of war. Th’ inspired host\r\n  With new-born ardor press the trembling ~GAUL~;\r\n  Nor greater throngs had reach’d eternal night,\r\n  Not if the fields of Agencourt had yawn’d\r\n  Exposing horrible the gulf of fate;\r\n  Or roaring Danube spread his arms abroad,\r\n  And overwhelm’d their legions with his floods.\r\n  But let the wand’ring muse at length return;\r\n  Nor yet, angelick genius of the sun,\r\n  In worthy lays her high-attempting song\r\n  Has blazon’d forth thy venerated name.\r\n  Then let her sweep the loud-resounding lyre\r\n  Again, again o’er each melodious string\r\n  Teach harmony to tremble with thy praise.\r\n  And still thine ear O favourable grant,\r\n  And she shall tell thee, that whatever charms,\r\n  Whatever beauties bloom on nature’s face,\r\n  Proceed from thy all-influencing light.\r\n  That when arising with tempestuous rage,\r\n  The North impetuous rides upon the clouds\r\n  Dispersing round the heav’ns obstructive gloom,\r\n  And with his dreaded prohibition stays\r\n  The kind effusion of thy genial beams;\r\n  Pale are the rubies on ~AURORA’S~ lips,\r\n  No more the roses blush upon her cheeks,\r\n  Black are Peneus’ streams and golden sands\r\n  In Tempe’s vale dull melancholy sits,\r\n  And every flower reclines its languid head.\r\n  By what high name shall I invoke thee, say,\r\n  Thou life-infusing deity, on thee\r\n  I call, and look propitious from on high,\r\n  While now to thee I offer up my prayer.\r\n  O had great ~NEWTON~, as he found the cause,\r\n  By which sound rouls thro’ th’ undulating air,\r\n  O had he, baffling times resistless power,\r\n  Discover’d what that subtle spirit is,\r\n  Or whatsoe’er diffusive else is spread\r\n  Over the wide-extended universe,\r\n  Which causes bodies to reflect the light,\r\n  And from their straight direction to divert\r\n  The rapid beams, that through their surface pierce.\r\n  But since embrac’d by th’ icy arms of age,\r\n  And his quick thought by times cold hand congeal’d,\r\n  Ev’n ~NEWTON~ left unknown this hidden power;\r\n  Thou from the race of human kind select\r\n  Some other worthy of an angel’s care,\r\n  With inspiration animate his breast,\r\n  And him instruct in these thy secret laws.\r\n  O let not ~NEWTON~, to whose spacious view,\r\n  Now unobstructed, all th’ extensive scenes\r\n  Of the ethereal ruler’s works arise;\r\n  When he beholds this earth he late adorn’d,\r\n  Let him not see philosophy in tears,\r\n  Like a fond mother solitary sit,\r\n  Lamenting him her dear, and only child.\r\n  But as the wise ~PYTHAGORAS~, and he,\r\n  Whose birth with pride the fam’d Abdera boasts,\r\n  With expectation having long survey’d\r\n  This spot their ancient seat, with joy beheld\r\n  Divine philosophy at length appear\r\n  In all her charms majestically fair,\r\n  Conducted by immortal ~NEWTON’S~ hand.\r\n  So may he see another sage arise,\r\n  That shall maintain her empire: then no more\r\n  Imperious ignorance with haughty sway\r\n  Shall stalk rapacious o’er the ravag’d globe:\r\n  Then thou, O ~NEWTON~, shalt protect these lines.\r\n  The humble tribute of the grateful muse;\r\n  Ne’er shall the sacrilegious hand despoil\r\n  Her laurel’d temples, whom his name preserves:\r\n  And were she equal to the mighty theme,\r\n  Futurity should wonder at her song;\r\n  Time should receive her with extended arms,\r\n  Seat her conspicuous in his rouling carr,\r\n  And bear her down to his extreamest bound.\r\n\r\n  ~FABLES~ with wonder tell how Terra’s sons\r\n  With iron force unloos’d the stubborn nerves\r\n  Of hills, and on the cloud-inshrouded top\r\n  Of Pelion Ossa pil’d. But if the vast\r\n  Gigantick deeds of savage strength demand\r\n  Astonishment from men, what then shalt thou,\r\n  O what expressive rapture of the soul,\r\n  When thou before us, ~NEWTON~, dost display\r\n  The labours of thy great excelling mind;\r\n  When thou unveilest all the wondrous scene,\r\n  The vast idea of th’ eternal king,\r\n  Not dreadful bearing in his angry arm\r\n  The thunder hanging o’er our trembling heads;\r\n  But with th’ effulgency of love replete,\r\n  And clad with power, which form’d th’ extensive heavens.\r\n  O happy he, whose enterprizing hand\r\n  Unbars the golden and relucid gates\r\n  Of th’ empyrean dome, where thou enthron’d\r\n  Philosophy art seated. Thou sustain’d\r\n  By the firm hand of everlasting truth\r\n  Despisest all the injuries of time;\r\n  Thou never know’st decay when all around,\r\n  Antiquity obscures her head. Behold\r\n  Th’ Egyptian towers, the Babylonian walls,\r\n  And Thebes with all her hundred gates of brass,\r\n  Behold them scatter’d like the dust abroad.\r\n  Whatever now is flourishing and proud,\r\n  Whatever shall, must know devouring age.\r\n  Euphrates’ stream, and seven-mouthed Nile,\r\n  And Danube, thou that from Germania’s soil\r\n  To the black Euxine’s far remoted shore,\r\n  O’er the wide bounds of mighty nations sweep’st\r\n  In thunder loud thy rapid floods along.\r\n  Ev’n you shall feel inexorable time;\r\n  To you the fatal day shall come; no more\r\n  Your torrents then shall shake the trembling ground,\r\n  No longer then to inundations swol’n\r\n  Th’ imperious waves the fertile pastures drench,\r\n  But shrunk within a narrow channel glide;\r\n  Or through the year’s reiterated course\r\n  When time himself grows old, your wond’rous streams\r\n  Lost ev’n to memory shall lie unknown\r\n  Beneath obscurity, and Chaos whelm’d,\r\n  But still thou sun illuminatest all\r\n  The azure regions round, thou guidest still\r\n  The orbits of the planetary spheres;\r\n  The moon still wanders o’er her changing course,\r\n  And still, O ~NEWTON~, shall thy name survive:\r\n  As long as nature’s hand directs the world,\r\n  When ev’ry dark obstruction shall retire,\r\n  And ev’ry secret yield its hidden store,\r\n  Which thee dim-sighted age forbad to see\r\n  Age that alone could stay thy rising soul.\r\n  And could mankind among the fixed stars,\r\n  E’en to th’ extremest bounds of knowledge reach,\r\n  To those unknown innumerable suns,\r\n  Whose light but glimmers from those distant worlds,\r\n  Ev’n to those utmost boundaries, those bars\r\n  That shut the entrance of th’ illumin’d space\r\n  Where angels only tread the vast unknown,\r\n  Thou ever should’st be seen immortal there:\r\n  In each new sphere, each new-appearing sun,\r\n  In farthest regions at the very verge\r\n  Of the wide universe should’st thou be seen.\r\n  And lo, th’ all-potent goddess ~NATURE~ takes\r\n  With her own hand thy great, thy just reward\r\n  Of immortality; aloft in air\r\n  See she displays, and with eternal grasp\r\n  Uprears the trophies of great ~NEWTON~’s fame.\r\n\r\n  R.

He once,\r\nindeed, intended to deliver, in a more familiar way, that part of\r\nhis inventions, which relates to the system of the world; but upon\r\nfarther consideration he altered his design. For as the nature of\r\nthose discoveries made it impossible to prove them upon any other than\r\ngeometrical principles; he apprehended, that those, who should not\r\nfully perceive the force of his arguments, would hardly be prevailed\r\non to exchange their former sentiments for new opinions, so very\r\ndifferent from what were commonly received[1]. He therefore chose\r\nrather to explain himself only to mathematical readers; and declined\r\nthe attempting to instruct such in any of his principles, who, by\r\nnot comprehending his method of reasoning, could not, at the first\r\nappearance of his discoveries, have been persuaded of their truth. But\r\nnow, since Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~’s doctrine has been fully established\r\nby the unanimous approbation of all, who are qualified to understand\r\nthe same; it is without doubt to be wished, that the whole of his\r\nimprovements in philosophy might be universally known. For this purpose\r\ntherefore I drew up the following papers, to give a general notion\r\nof our great philosopher’s inventions to such, as are not prepared\r\nto read his own works, and yet might desire to be informed of the\r\nprogress, he has made in natural knowledge; not doubting but there were\r\nmany, besides those, whose turn of mind had led them into a course of\r\nmathematical studies, that would take great pleasure in tasting of this\r\ndelightful fountain of science.\r\n\r\n2. IT is a just remark, which has been made upon the human mind, that\r\nnothing is more suitable to it, than the contemplation of truth; and\r\nthat all men are moved with a strong desire after knowledge; esteeming\r\nit honourable to excel therein; and holding it, on the contrary,\r\ndisgraceful to mistake, err, or be in any way deceived. And this\r\nsentiment is by nothing more fully illustrated, than by the inclination\r\nof men to gain an acquaintance with the operations of nature; which\r\ndisposition to enquire after the causes of things is so general, that\r\nall men of letters, I believe, find themselves influenced by it. Nor\r\nis it difficult to assign a reason for this, if we consider only, that\r\nour desire after knowledge is an effect of that taste for the sublime\r\nand the beautiful in things, which chiefly constitutes the difference\r\nbetween the human life, and the life of brutes. These inferior animals\r\npartake with us of the pleasures, that immediately flow from the bodily\r\nsenses and appetites; but our minds are furnished with a superior\r\nsense, by which we are capable of receiving various degrees of delight,\r\nwhere the creatures below us perceive no difference. Hence arises\r\nthat pursuit of grace and elegance in our thoughts and actions, and\r\nin all things belonging to us, which principally creates imployment\r\nfor the active mind of man. The thoughts of the human mind are too\r\nextensive to be confined only to the providing and enjoying of what\r\nis necessary for the support of our being. It is this taste, which\r\nhas given rise to poetry, oratory, and every branch of literature and\r\nscience. From hence we feel great pleasure in conceiving strongly, and\r\nin apprehending clearly, even where the passions are not concerned.\r\nPerspicuous reasoning appears not only beautiful; but, when set forth\r\nin its full strength and dignity, it partakes of the sublime, and not\r\nonly pleases, but warms and elevates the soul. This is the source of\r\nour strong desire of knowledge; and the same taste for the sublime\r\nand the beautiful directs us to chuse particularly the productions of\r\nnature for the subject of our contemplation: our creator having so\r\nadapted our minds to the condition, wherein he has placed us, that all\r\nhis visible works, before we inquire into their make, strike us with\r\nthe most lively ideas of beauty and magnificence.\r\n\r\n3. BUT if there be so strong a passion in contemplative minds for\r\nnatural philosophy; all such must certainly receive a particular\r\npleasure in being informed of Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~’s discoveries, who\r\nalone has been able to make any great advancements in the true course\r\nleading to natural knowledge: whereas this important subject had before\r\nbeen usually attempted with that negligence, as cannot be reflected\r\non without surprize. Excepting a very few, who, by pursuing a more\r\nrational method, had gained a little true knowledge in some particular\r\nparts of nature; the writers in this science had generally treated of\r\nit after such a manner, as if they thought, that no degree of certainty\r\nwas ever to be hoped for. The custom was to frame conjectures; and if\r\nupon comparing them with things, there appeared some kind of agreement,\r\nthough very imperfect, it was held sufficient. Yet at the same time\r\nnothing less was undertaken than intire systems, and fathoming at once\r\nthe greatest depths of nature; as if the secret causes of natural\r\neffects, contrived and framed by infinite wisdom, could be searched\r\nout by the slightest endeavours of our weak understandings. Whereas\r\nthe only method, that can afford us any prospect of success in this\r\ndifficult work, is to make our enquiries with the utmost caution, and\r\nby very slow degrees. And after our most diligent labour, the greatest\r\npart of nature will, no doubt, for ever remain beyond our reach.\r\n\r\n4. THIS neglect of the proper means to enlarge our knowledge, joined\r\nwith the presumption to attempt, what was quite out of the power of our\r\nlimited faculties, the Lord BACON judiciously observes to be the great\r\nobstruction to the progress of science[2]. Indeed that excellent person\r\nwas the first, who expresly writ against this way of philosophizing;\r\nand he has laid open at large the absurdity of it in his admirable\r\ntreatise, intitled NOVUM ORGANON SCIENTIARUM; and has there likewise\r\ndescribed the true method, which ought to be followed.\r\n\r\n5. THERE are, saith he, but two methods, that can be taken in the\r\npursuit of natural knowledge. One is to make a hasty transition\r\nfrom our first and slight observations on things to general axioms,\r\nand then to proceed upon those axioms, as certain and uncontestable\r\nprinciples, without farther examination. The other method; (which he\r\nobserves to be the only true one, but to his time unattempted;) is to\r\nproceed cautiously, to advance step by step, reserving the most general\r\nprinciples for the last result of our inquiries[3]. Concerning the\r\nfirst of these two methods; where objections, which happen to appear\r\nagainst any such axioms taken up in haste, are evaded by some frivolous\r\ndistinction, when the axiom it self ought rather to be corrected[4];\r\nhe affirms, that the united endeavours of all ages cannot make it\r\nsuccessful; because this original error in the first digestion of\r\nthe mind (as he expresses himself) cannot afterwards be remedied[5]:\r\nwhereby he would signify to us, that if we set out in a wrong way; no\r\ndiligence or art, we can use, while we follow so erroneous a course,\r\nwill ever bring us to our designed end. And doubtless it cannot prove\r\notherwise; for in this spacious field of nature, if once we forsake\r\nthe true path, we shall immediately lose our selves, and must for ever\r\nwander with uncertainty.\r\n\r\n6. THE impossibility of succeeding in so faulty a method of\r\nphilosophizing his Lordship endeavours to prove from the many false\r\nnotions and prejudices, to which the mind of man is exposed[6]. And\r\nsince this judicious writer apprehends, that men are so exceeding\r\nliable to fall into these wrong tracts of thinking, as to incur great\r\ndanger of being misled by them, even while they enter on the true\r\ncourse in pursuit of nature[7]; I trust, I shall be excused, if, by\r\ninsisting a little particularly upon this argument, I endeavour to\r\nremove whatever prejudice of this kind, might possibly entangle the\r\nmind of any of my readers.\r\n\r\n7. HIS Lordship has reduced these prejudices and false modes of\r\nconception under four distinct heads[8].\r\n\r\n8. THE first head contains such, as we are subject to from the very\r\ncondition of humanity, through the weakness both of our senses, and of\r\nthe faculties of the mind[9]; seeing, as this author well observes, the\r\nsubtilty of nature far exceeds the greatest subtilty of our senses or\r\nacutest reasonings[10]. One of the false modes of conception, which\r\nhe mentions under this head, is the forming to our selves a fanciful\r\nsimplicity and regularity in natural things. This he illustrates by\r\nthe following instances; the conceiving the planets to move in perfect\r\ncircles; the adding an orb of fire to the other three elements, and\r\nthe supposing each of these to exceed the other in rarity, just in a\r\ndecuple proportion[11]. And of the same nature is the assertion of\r\n~DES CARTES~, without any proof, that all things are made up\r\nof three kinds of matter only[12]. As also this opinion of another\r\nphilosopher; that light, in passing through different mediums, was\r\nrefracted, so as to proceed by that way, through which it would move\r\nmore speedily, than through any other[13]. The second erroneous turn\r\nof mind, taken notice of by his Lordship under this head, is, that\r\nall men are in some degree prone to a fondness for any notions, which\r\nthey have once imbibed; whereby they often wrest things to reconcile\r\nthem to those notions, and neglect the consideration of whatever will\r\nnot be brought to an agreement with them; just as those do, who are\r\naddicted to judicial astrology, to the observation of dreams, and to\r\nsuch-like superstitions; who carefully preserve the memory of every\r\nincident, which serves to confirm their prejudices, and let slip out of\r\ntheir minds all instances, that make against them[14]. There is also\r\na farther impediment to true knowledge, mentioned under the same head\r\nby this noble writer, which is; that whereas, through the weakness\r\nand imperfection of our senses, many things are concealed. from us,\r\nwhich have the greatest effect in producing natural appearances; our\r\nminds are ordinarily most affected by that, which makes the strongest\r\nimpression on our organs of sense; whereby we are apt to judge of\r\nthe real importance of things in nature by a wrong measure[15]. So,\r\nbecause the figuration and the motion of bodies strike our senses more\r\nimmediately than most of their other properties, DES CARTES and his\r\nfollowers will not allow any other explication of natural appearances,\r\nthan from the figure and motion of the parts of matter. By which\r\nexample we see how justly his Lordship observes this cause of error to\r\nbe the greatest of any[16]; since it has given rise to a fundamental\r\nprinciple in a system of philosophy, that not long ago obtained almost\r\nan universal reputation.\r\n\r\n9. THESE are the chief branches of those obstructions to knowledge,\r\nwhich this author has reduced under his first head of false\r\nconceptions. The second head contains the errors, to which particular\r\npersons are more especially obnoxious[17]. One of these is the\r\nconsequence of a preceding observation: that as we are exposed to be\r\ncaptivated by any opinions, which have once taken possession of our\r\nminds; so in particular, natural knowledge has been much corrupted by\r\nthe strong attachment of men to some one part of science, of which\r\nthey reputed themselves the inventers, or about which they have spent\r\nmuch of their time; and hence have been apt to conceive it to be of\r\ngreater use in the study of natural philosophy than it was: like\r\nARISTOTLE, who reduced his physics to logical disputations; and the\r\nchymists, who thought, that nature could be laid open only by the\r\nforce of their fires[18]. Some again are wholly carried away by an\r\nexcessive veneration for antiquity; others, by too great fondness\r\nfor the moderns; few having their minds so well balanced, as neither\r\nto depreciate the merit of the ancients, nor yet to despise the real\r\nimprovements of later times[19]. To this is added by his Lordship a\r\ndifference in the genius of men, that some are most fitted to observe\r\nthe similitude, there is in things, while others are more qualified to\r\ndiscern the particulars, wherein they disagree; both which dispositions\r\nof mind are useful: but to the prejudice of philosophy men are apt to\r\nrun into excess in each; while one sort of genius dwells too much upon\r\nthe gross and sum of things, and the other upon trifling minutenesses\r\nand shadowy distinctions[20].\r\n\r\n10. UNDER the third head of prejudices and false notions this writer\r\nconsiders such, as follow from the lax and indefinite use of words in\r\nordinary discourse; which occasions great ambiguities and uncertainties\r\nin philosophical debates (as another eminent philosopher has since\r\nshewn more at large[21];) insomuch that this our author thinks a strict\r\ndefining of terms to be scarce an infallible remedy against this\r\ninconvenience[22]. And perhaps he has no small reason on his side: for\r\nthe common inaccurate sense of words, notwithstanding the limitations\r\ngiven them by definitions, will offer it self so constantly to the\r\nmind, as to require great caution and circumspection for us not to be\r\ndeceived thereby. Of this we have a very eminent instance in the great\r\ndisputes, that have been raised about the use of the word attraction in\r\nphilosophy; of which we shall be obliged hereafter to make particular\r\nmention[23]. Words thus to be guarded against are of two kinds. Some\r\nare names of things, that are only imaginary[24]; such words are wholly\r\nto be rejected. But there are other terms, that allude to what is real,\r\nthough their signification is confused[25]. And these latter must of\r\nnecessity be continued in use; but their sense cleared up, and freed,\r\nas much as possible, from obscurity.\r\n\r\n11. THE last general head of these errors comprehends such, as follow\r\nfrom the various sects of false philosophies; which this author divides\r\ninto three sorts, the sophistical, empirical, and superstitious[26]. By\r\nthe first of these he means a philosophy built upon speculations only\r\nwithout experiments[27]; by the second, where experiments are blindly\r\nadhered to, without proper reasoning upon them[28]; and by the third,\r\nwrong opinions of nature fixed in mens minds either through false\r\nreligions, or from misunderstanding the declarations of the true[29].\r\n\r\n12. THESE are the four principal canals, by which this judicious author\r\nthinks, that philosophical errors have flowed in upon us. And he\r\nrightly observes, that the faulty method of proceeding in philosophy,\r\nagainst which he writes[30], is so far from assisting us towards\r\novercoming these prejudices; that he apprehends it rather suited to\r\nrivet them more firmly to the mind[31]. How great reason then has his\r\nLordship to call this way of philosophizing the parent of error, and\r\nthe bane of all knowledge[32]? For, indeed, what else but mistakes can\r\nso bold and presumptuous a treatment of nature produce? have we the\r\nwisdom necessary to frame a world, that we should think so easily,\r\nand with so slight a search to enter into the most secret springs of\r\nnature, and discover the original causes of things? what chimeras, what\r\nmonsters has not this preposterous method brought forth? what schemes,\r\nor what hypothesis’s of the subtilest wits has not a stricter enquiry\r\ninto nature not only overthrown, but manifested to be ridiculous and\r\nabsurd? Every new improvement, which we make in this science, lets us\r\nsee more and more the weakness of our guesses. Dr. HARVEY, by that\r\none discovery of the circulation of the blood, has dissipated all the\r\nspeculations and reasonings of many ages upon the animal oeconomy.\r\nASELLIUS, by detecting the lacteal veins, shewed how little ground all\r\nphysicians and philosophers had in conjecturing, that the nutritive\r\npart of the aliment was absorbed by the mouths of the veins spread\r\nupon the bowels: and then PECQUET, by finding out the thoracic duct,\r\nas evidently proved the vanity of the opinion, which was persisted in\r\nafter the lacteal vessels were known, that the alimental juice was\r\nconveyed immediately to the liver, and there converted into blood.\r\n\r\n13. AS these things set forth the great absurdity of proceeding in\r\nphilosophy on conjectures, by informing us how far the operations\r\nof nature are above our low conceptions; so on the other hand, such\r\ninstances of success from a more judicious method shew us, that our\r\nbountiful maker has not left us wholly without means of delighting\r\nour selves in the contemplation of his wisdom. That by a just way of\r\ninquiry into nature, we could not fail of arriving at discoveries\r\nvery remote from our apprehensions; the Lord ~BACON~ himself\r\nargues from the experience of mankind. If, says he, the force of guns\r\nshould be described to any one ignorant of them, by their effects only,\r\nhe might reasonably suppose, that those engines of destruction were\r\nonly a more artificial composition, than he knew, of wheels and other\r\nmechanical powers: but it could never enter his thoughts, that their\r\nimmense force should be owing to a peculiar substance, which would\r\nenkindle into so violent an explosion, as we experience in gunpowder:\r\nsince he would no where see the least example of any such operation;\r\nexcept perhaps in earthquakes and thunder, which he would doubtless\r\nlook upon as exalted powers of nature, greatly surpassing any art of\r\nman to imitate. In the same manner, if a stranger to the original\r\nof silk were shewn a garment made of it, he would be very far from\r\nimagining so strong a substance to be spun out of the bowels of a small\r\nworm; but must certainly believe it either a vegetable substance, like\r\nflax or cotton; or the natural covering of some animal, as wool is\r\nof sheep. Or had we been told, before the invention of the magnetic\r\nneedle among us, that another people was in possession of a certain\r\ncontrivance, by which they were inabled to discover the position of\r\nthe heavens, with vastly more ease, than we could do; what could have\r\nbeen imagined more, than that they were provided with some fitter\r\nastronomical instrument for this purpose than we? That any stone should\r\nhave so amazing a property, as we find in the magnet, must have been\r\nthe remotest from our thoughts[33].\r\n\r\n14. BUT what surprizing advancements in the knowledge of nature may be\r\nmade by pursuing the true course in philosophical inquiries; when those\r\nsearches are conducted by a genius equal to so divine a work, will be\r\nbest understood by considering Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ discoveries.\r\nThat my’s reader may apprehend as just a notion of these, as can be\r\nconveyed to him, by the brief account, which I intend to lay before\r\nhim; I have set apart this introduction for explaining, in the fullest\r\nmanner I am able, the principles, whereon Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ proceeds.\r\nFor without a clear conception of these, it is impossible to form any\r\ntrue idea of the singular excellence of the inventions of this great\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n15. THE principles then of this philosophy are; upon no consideration\r\nto indulge conjectures concerning the powers and laws of nature, but\r\nto make it our endeavour with all diligence to search out the real\r\nand true laws, by which the constitution of things is regulated. The\r\nphilosopher’s first care must be to distinguish, what he sees to be\r\nwithin his power, from what is beyond his reach; to assume no greater\r\ndegree of knowledge, than what he finds himself possessed of; but to\r\nadvance by slow and cautious steps; to search gradually into natural\r\ncauses; to secure to himself the knowledge of the most immediate cause\r\nof each appearance, before he extends his views farther to causes\r\nmore remote. This is the method, in which philosophy ought to be\r\ncultivated; which does not pretend to so great things, as the more\r\nairy speculations; but will perform abundantly more: we shall not\r\nperhaps seem to the unskilful to know so much, but our real knowledge\r\nwill be greater. And certainly it is no objection against this method,\r\nthat some others promise, what is nearer to the extent of our wishes:\r\nsince this, if it will not teach us all we could desire to be informed\r\nof, will however give us some true light into nature; which no other\r\ncan do. Nor has the philosopher any reason to think his labour lost,\r\nwhen he finds himself stopt at the cause first discovered by him, or\r\nat any other more remote cause, short of the original: for if he has\r\nbut sufficiently proved any one cause, he has entered so far into the\r\nreal constitution of things, has laid a safe foundation for others to\r\nwork upon, and has facilitated their endeavours in the search after\r\nyet more distant causes; and besides, in the mean time he may apply\r\nthe knowledge of these intermediate causes to many useful purposes.\r\nIndeed the being able to make practical deductions from natural causes,\r\nconstitutes the great distinction between the true philosophy and the\r\nfalse. Causes assumed upon conjecture, must be so loose and undefined,\r\nthat nothing particular can be collected from them. But those causes,\r\nwhich are brought to light by a strict examination of things, will be\r\nmore distinct. Hence it appears to have been no unuseful discovery,\r\nthat the ascent of water in pumps is owing to the pressure of the\r\nair by its weight or spring; though the causes, which make the air\r\ngravitate, and render it elastic, be unknown: for notwithstanding\r\nwe are ignorant of the original, whence these powers of the air are\r\nderived; yet we may receive much advantage from the bare knowledge of\r\nthese powers. If we are but certain of the degree of force, wherewith\r\nthey act, we shall know the extent of what is to be expected from\r\nthem; we shall know the greatest height, to which it is possible by\r\npumps to raise water; and shall thereby be prevented from making any\r\nuseless efforts towards improving these instruments beyond the limits\r\nprescribed to them by nature; whereas without so much knowledge as\r\nthis, we might probably have wasted in attempts of this kind much time\r\nand labour. How long did philosophers busy themselves to no purpose\r\nin endeavouring to perfect telescopes, by forming the glasses into\r\nsome new figure; till Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ demonstrated, that\r\nthe effects of telescopes were limited from another cause, than was\r\nsupposed; which no alteration in the figure of the glasses could\r\nremedy? What method Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ himself has found for\r\nthe improvement of telescopes shall be explained hereafter[34]. But\r\nat present I shall proceed to illustrate, by some farther instances,\r\nthis distinguishing character of the true philosophy, which we have now\r\nunder consideration. It was no trifling discovery, that the contraction\r\nof the muscles of animals puts their limbs in motion, though the\r\noriginal cause of that contraction remains a secret, and perhaps may\r\nalways do so; for the knowledge of thus much only has given rise to\r\nmany speculations upon the force and artificial disposition of the\r\nmuscles, and has opened no narrow prospect into the animal fabrick.\r\nThe finding out, that the nerves are great agents in this action,\r\nleads us yet nearer to the original cause, and yields us a wider\r\nview of the subject. And each of these steps affords us assistance\r\ntowards restoring this animal motion, when impaired in our selves,\r\nby pointing out the seats of the injuries, to which it is obnoxious.\r\nTo neglect all this, because we can hitherto advance no farther, is\r\nplainly ridiculous. It is confessed by all, that ~GALILEO~\r\ngreatly improved philosophy, by shewing, as we shall relate hereafter,\r\nthat the power in bodies, which we call gravity, occasions them to\r\nmove downwards with a velocity equably accelerated[35]; and that when\r\nany body is thrown forwards, the same power obliges it to describe in\r\nits motion that line, which is called by geometers a parabola[36]:\r\nyet we are ignorant of the cause, which makes bodies gravitate. But\r\nalthough we are unacquainted with the spring, whence this power in\r\nnature is derived, nevertheless we can estimate its effects. When a\r\nbody falls perpendicularly, it is known, how long time it takes in\r\ndescending from any height whatever: and if it be thrown forwards,\r\nwe know the real path, which it describes; we can determine in what\r\ndirection, and with what degree of swiftness it must be projected,\r\nin order to its striking against any object desired; and we can also\r\nascertain the very force, wherewith it will strike. Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ has farther taught, that this power of gravitation extends\r\nup to the moon, and causes that planet to gravitate as much towards\r\nthe earth, as any of the bodies, which are familiar to us, would, if\r\nplaced at the same distance[37]: he has proved likewise, that all\r\nthe planets gravitate towards the sun, and towards one another; and\r\nthat their respective motions follow from this gravitation. All this\r\nhe has demonstrated upon indisputable geometrical principles, which\r\ncannot be rendered precarious for want of knowing what it is, which\r\ncauses these bodies thus mutually to gravitate: any more than we can\r\ndoubt of the propensity in all the bodies about us, to descend towards\r\nthe earth; or can call in question the forementioned propositions\r\nof ~GALILEO~, which are built upon that principle. And as\r\n~GALILEO~ has shewn more fully, than was known before, what\r\neffects were produced in the motion of bodies by their gravitation\r\ntowards the earth; so Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~, by this his\r\ninvention, has much advanced our knowledge in the celestial motions.\r\nBy discovering that the moon gravitates towards the sun, as well as\r\ntowards the earth; he has laid open those intricacies in the moon’s\r\nmotion, which no astronomer, from observations only, could ever find\r\nout[38]: and one kind of heavenly bodies, the comets, have their motion\r\nnow clearly ascertained; whereof we had before no true knowledge at\r\nall[39].\r\n\r\n16. DOUBTLESS it might be expected, that such surprizing success should\r\nhave silenced, at once, every cavil. But we have seen the contrary.\r\nFor because this philosophy professes modestly to keep within the\r\nextent of our faculties, and is ready to confess its imperfections,\r\nrather than to make any fruitless attempts to conceal them, by seeking\r\nto cover the defects in our knowledge with the vain ostentation of\r\nrash and groundless conjectures; hence has been taken an occasion\r\nto insinuate that we are led to miraculous causes, and the occult\r\nqualities of the schools.\r\n\r\n17. BUT the first of these accusations is very extraordinary. If by\r\ncalling these causes miraculous nothing more is meant than only, that\r\nthey often appear to us wonderful and surprizing, it is not easy\r\nto see what difficulty can be raised from thence; for the works of\r\nnature discover every where such proofs of the unbounded power, and\r\nthe consummate wisdom of their author, that the more they are known,\r\nthe more they will excite our admiration: and it is too manifest to\r\nbe insisted on, that the common sense of the word miraculous can have\r\nno place here, when it implies what is above the ordinary course of\r\nthings. The other imputation, that these causes are occult upon the\r\naccount of our not perceiving what produces them, contains in it great\r\nambiguity. That something relating to them lies hid, the followers\r\nof this philosophy are ready to acknowledge, nay desire it should be\r\ncarefully remarked, as pointing out proper subjects for future inquiry.\r\nBut this is very different from the proceeding of the schoolmen in\r\nthe causes called by them occult. For as their occult qualities were\r\nunderstood to operate in a manner occult, and not apprehended by us; so\r\nthey were obtruded upon us for such original and essential properties\r\nin bodies, as made it vain to seek any farther cause; and a greater\r\npower was attributed to them, than any natural appearances authorized.\r\nFor instance, the rise of water in pumps was ascribed to a certain\r\nabhorrence of a vacuum, which they thought fit to assign to nature. And\r\nthis was so far a true observation, that the water does move, contrary\r\nto its usual course, into the space, which otherwise would be left\r\nvoid of any sensible matter; and, that the procuring such a vacuity\r\nwas the apparent cause of the water’s ascent. But while we were not in\r\nthe least informed how this power, called an abhorrence of a vacuum,\r\nproduced the visible effects; instead of making any advancement in the\r\nknowledge of nature, we only gave an artificial name to one of her\r\noperations: and when the speculation was pushed so beyond what any\r\nappearances required, as to have it concluded, that this abhorrence\r\nof a vacuum was a power inherent in all matter, and so unlimited as\r\nto render it impossible for a vacuum to exist at all; it then became\r\na much greater absurdity, in being made the foundation of a most\r\nridiculous manner of reasoning; as at length evidently appeared, when\r\nit came to be discovered, that this rise of the water followed only\r\nfrom the pressure of the air, and extended it self no farther, than\r\nthe power of that cause. The scholastic stile in discoursing of these\r\noccult qualities, as if they were essential differences in the very\r\nsubstances, of which bodies consisted, was certainly very absurd; by\r\nreason it tended to discourage all farther inquiry. But no such ill\r\nconsequences can follow from the considering of any natural causes,\r\nwhich confessedly are not traced up to their first original. How\r\nshall we ever come to the knowledge of the several original causes of\r\nthings, otherwise than by storing up all intermediate causes which we\r\ncan discover? Are all the original and essential properties of matter\r\nso very obvious, that none of them can escape our first view? This is\r\nnot probable. It is much more likely, that, if some of the essential\r\nproperties are discovered by our first observations, a stricter\r\nexamination should bring more to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. BUT in order to clear up this point concerning the essential\r\nproperties of matter, let us consider the subject a little distinctly.\r\nWe are to conceive, that the matter, out of which the universe of\r\nthings is formed, is furnished with certain qualities and powers,\r\nwhereby it is rendered fit to answer the purposes, for which it was\r\ncreated. But every property, of which any particle of this matter is\r\nin it self possessed, and which is not barely the consequence of the\r\nunion of this particle with other portions of matter, we may call an\r\nessential property: whereas all other qualities or attributes belonging\r\nto bodies, which depend on their particular frame and composition, are\r\nnot essential to the matter, whereof such bodies are made; because\r\nthe matter of these bodies will be deprived of those qualities, only\r\nby the dissolution of the body, without working any change in the\r\noriginal constitution of one single particle of this mass of matter.\r\nExtension we apprehend to be one of these essential properties, and\r\nimpenetrability another. These two belong universally to all matter;\r\nand are the principal ingredients in the idea, which this word matter\r\nusually excites in the mind. Yet as the idea, marked by this name,\r\nis not purely the creature of our own understandings, but is taken\r\nfor the representation of a certain substance without us; if we\r\nshould discover, that every part of the substance, in which we find\r\nthese two properties, should likewise be endowed universally with any\r\nother essential qualities; all these, from the time they come to our\r\nnotice, must be united under our general idea of matter. How many\r\nsuch properties there are actually in all matter we know not; those,\r\nof which we are at present apprized, have been found out only by our\r\nobservations on things; how many more a farther search may bring to\r\nlight, no one can say; nor are we certain, that we are provided with\r\nsufficient methods of perception to discern them all. Therefore, since\r\nwe have no other way of making discoveries in nature, but by gradual\r\ninquiries into the properties of bodies; our first step must be to\r\nadmit without distinction all the properties, which we observe; and\r\nafterwards we must endeavour, as far as we are able, to distinguish\r\nbetween the qualities, wherewith the very substances themselves are\r\nindued, and those appearances, which result from the structure only of\r\ncompound bodies. Some of the properties, which we observe in things,\r\nare the attributes of particular bodies only; others universally belong\r\nto all, that fall under our notice. Whether some of the qualities and\r\npowers of particular bodies, be derived from different kinds of matter\r\nentring their composition, cannot, in the present imperfect state\r\nof our knowledge, absolutely be decided; though we have not yet any\r\nreason to conclude, but that all the bodies, with which we converse,\r\nare framed out of the very same kind of matter, and that their\r\ndistinct qualities are occasioned only by their structure; through\r\nthe variety whereof the general powers of matter are caused to produce\r\ndifferent effects. On the other hand, we should not hastily conclude,\r\nthat whatever is found to appertain to all matter, which falls under\r\nour examination, must for that reason only be an essential property\r\nthereof, and not be derived from some unseen disposition in the frame\r\nof nature. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has found reason to conclude,\r\nthat gravity is a property universally belonging to all the perceptible\r\nbodies in the universe, and to every particle of matter, whereof they\r\nare composed. But yet he no where asserts this property to be essential\r\nto matter. And he was so far from having any design of establishing\r\nit as such, that, on the contrary, he has given some hints worthy of\r\nhimself at a cause for it[40]; and expresly says, that he proposed\r\nthose hints to shew, that he had no such intention[41].\r\n\r\n19. IT appears from hence, that it is not easy to determine, what\r\nproperties of bodies are essentially inherent in the matter, out of\r\nwhich they are made, and what depend upon their frame and composition.\r\nBut certainly whatever properties are found to belong either to any\r\nparticular systems of matter, or universally to all, must be considered\r\nin philosophy; because philosophy will be otherwise imperfect. Whether\r\nthose properties can be deduced from some other appertaining to\r\nmatter, either among those, which are already known, or among such as\r\ncan be discovered by us, is afterwards to be sought for the farther\r\nimprovement of our knowledge. But this inquiry cannot properly have\r\nplace in the deliberation about admitting any property of matter or\r\nbodies into philosophy; for that purpose it is only to be considered,\r\nwhether the existence of such a property has been justly proved or not.\r\nTherefore to decide what causes of things are rightly received into\r\nnatural philosophy, requires only a distinct and clear conception of\r\nwhat kind of reasoning is to be allowed of as convincing, when we argue\r\nupon the works of nature.\r\n\r\n20. THE proofs in natural philosophy cannot be so absolutely\r\nconclusive, as in the mathematics. For the subjects of that science\r\nare purely the ideas of our own minds. They may be represented to our\r\nsenses by material objects, but they are themselves the arbitrary\r\nproductions of our own thoughts; so that as the mind can have a full\r\nand adequate knowledge of its own ideas, the reasoning in geometry\r\ncan be rendered perfect. But in natural knowledge the subject of\r\nour contemplation is without us, and not so compleatly to be known:\r\ntherefore our method of arguing must fall a little short of absolute\r\nperfection. It is only here required to steer a just course between\r\nthe conjectural method of proceeding, against which I have so largely\r\nspoke; and demanding so rigorous a proof, as will reduce all philosophy\r\nto mere scepticism, and exclude all prospect of making any progress in\r\nthe knowledge of nature.\r\n\r\n21. THE concessions, which are to be allowed in this science, are by\r\nSir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ included under a very few simple precepts.\r\n\r\n22. THE first is, that more causes are not to be received into\r\nphilosophy, than are sufficient to explain the appearances of nature.\r\nThat this rule is approved of unanimously, is evident from those\r\nexpressions so frequent among all philosophers, that nature does\r\nnothing in vain; and that a variety of means, where fewer would\r\nsuffice, is needless. And certainly there is the highest reason\r\nfor complying with this rule. For should we indulge the liberty of\r\nmultiplying, without necessity, the causes of things, it would reduce\r\nall philosophy to mere uncertainty; since the only proof, which we can\r\nhave, of the existence of a cause, is the necessity of it for producing\r\nknown effects. Therefore where one cause is sufficient, if there really\r\nshould in nature be two, which is in the last degree improbable, we can\r\nhave no possible means of knowing it, and consequently ought not to\r\ntake the liberty of imagining, that there are more than one.\r\n\r\n23. THE second precept is the direct consequence of the first, that to\r\nlike effects are to be ascribed the same causes. For instance, that\r\nrespiration in men and in brutes is brought about by the same means;\r\nthat bodies descend to the earth here in EUROPE, and in AMERICA from\r\nthe same principle; that the light of a culinary fire, and of the sun\r\nhave the same manner of production; that the reflection of light is\r\neffected in the earth, and in the planets by the same power; and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n24. THE third of these precepts has equally evident reason for it.\r\nIt is only, that those qualities, which in the same body can neither\r\nbe lessened nor increased, and which belong to all bodies that are\r\nin our power to make trial upon, ought to be accounted the universal\r\nproperties of all bodies whatever.\r\n\r\n25. IN this precept is founded that method of arguing by induction,\r\nwithout which no progress could be made in natural philosophy. For as\r\nthe qualities of bodies become known to us by experiments only; we\r\nhave no other way of finding the properties of such bodies, as are\r\nout of our reach to experiment upon, but by drawing conclusions from\r\nthose which fall under our examination. The only caution here required\r\nis, that the observations and experiments, we argue upon, be numerous\r\nenough, and that due regard be paid to all objections, that occur, as\r\nthe Lord BACON very judiciously directs[42]. And this admonition is\r\nsufficiently complied with, when by virtue of this rule we ascribe\r\nimpenetrability and extension to all bodies, though we have no sensible\r\nexperiment, that affords a direct proof of any of the celestial bodies\r\nbeing impenetrable; nor that the fixed stars are so much as extended.\r\nFor the more perfect our instruments are, whereby we attempt to find\r\ntheir visible magnitude, the less they appear; insomuch that all the\r\nsensible magnitude, which we observe in them, seems only to be an\r\noptical deception by the scattering of their light. However, I suppose\r\nno one will imagine they are without any magnitude, though their\r\nimmense distance makes it undiscernable by us. After the same manner,\r\nif it can be proved, that all bodies here gravitate towards the earth,\r\nin proportion to the quantity of solid matter in each; and that the\r\nmoon gravitates to the earth likewise, in proportion to the quantity\r\nof matter in it; and that the sea gravitates towards the moon, and\r\nall the planets towards each other; and that the very comets have the\r\nsame gravitating faculty; we shall have as great reason to conclude by\r\nthis rule, that all bodies gravitate towards each other. For indeed\r\nthis rule will more strongly hold in this case, than in that of the\r\nimpenetrability of bodies; because there will more instances be had of\r\nbodies gravitating, than of their being impenetrable.\r\n\r\n25. THIS is that method of induction, whereon all philosophy is\r\nfounded; which our author farther inforces by this additional precept,\r\nthat whatever is collected from this induction, ought to be received,\r\nnotwithstanding any conjectural hypothesis to the contrary, till such\r\ntimes as it shall be contradicted or limited by farther observations on\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ~BOOK I.~\r\n  CONCERNING THE\r\n  MOTION of BODIES\r\n  IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP. I.\r\n  Of the LAWS of MOTION.\r\n\r\nHAVING thus explained Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON’s~ method of reasoning\r\nin philosophy, I shall now proceed to my intended account of his\r\ndiscoveries. These are contained in two treatises. In one of them, the\r\nMATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, his chief design is to\r\nshew by what laws the heavenly motions are regulated; in the other,\r\nhis OPTICS, he discourses of the nature of light and colours, and of\r\nthe action between light and bodies. This second treatise is wholly\r\nconfined to the subject of light: except some conjectures proposed\r\nat the end concerning other parts of nature, which lie hitherto more\r\nconcealed. In the other treatise our author was obliged to smooth the\r\nway to his principal intention, by explaining many things of a more\r\ngeneral nature: for even some of the most simple properties of matter\r\nwere scarce well established at that time. We may therefore reduce Sir\r\n~ISAAC NEWTON~’s doctrine under three general heads; and I\r\nshall accordingly divide my account into three books. In the first I\r\nshall speak of what he has delivered concerning the motion of bodies,\r\nwithout regard to any particular system of matter; in the second I\r\nshall treat of the heavenly motions; and the third shall be employed\r\nupon light.\r\n\r\n2. IN the first part of my design, we must begin with an account of the\r\ngeneral laws of motion.\r\n\r\n3. THESE laws are some universal affections and properties of matter\r\ndrawn from experience, which are made use of as axioms and evident\r\nprinciples in all our arguings upon the motion of bodies. For as it\r\nis the custom of geometers to assume in their demonstrations some\r\npropositions, without exhibiting the proof of them; so in philosophy,\r\nall our reasoning must be built upon some properties of matter, first\r\nadmitted as principles whereon to argue. In geometry these axioms are\r\nthus assumed, on account of their being so evident as to make any\r\nproof in form needless. But in philosophy no properties of bodies can\r\nbe in this manner received for self-evident; since it has been observed\r\nabove, that we can conclude nothing concerning matter by any reasonings\r\nupon its nature and essence, but that we owe all the knowledge, we\r\nhave thereof, to experience. Yet when our observations on matter have\r\ninform’d us of some of its properties, we may securely reason upon them\r\nin our farther inquiries into nature. And these laws of motion, of\r\nwhich I am here to speak, are found so universally to belong to bodies,\r\nthat there is no motion known, which is not regulated by them. These\r\nare by Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ reduced to three[43].\r\n\r\n4. THE first law is, that all bodies have such an indifference to rest,\r\nor motion, that if once at rest they remain so, till disturbed by some\r\npower acting upon them: but if once put in motion, they persist in\r\nit; continuing to move right forwards perpetually, after the power,\r\nwhich gave the motion, is removed; and also preserving the same degree\r\nof velocity or quickness, as was first communicated, not stopping or\r\nremitting their course, till interrupted or otherwise disturbed by some\r\nnew power impressed.\r\n\r\n5. THE second law of motion is, that the alteration of the state of\r\nany body, whether from rest to motion, or from motion to rest, or\r\nfrom one degree of motion to another, is always proportional to the\r\nforce impressed. A body at rest, when acted upon by any power, yields\r\nto that power, moving in the same line, in which the power applied\r\nis directed; and moves with a less or greater degree of velocity,\r\naccording to the degree of the power; so that twice the power shall\r\ncommunicate a double velocity, and three times the power a threefold\r\nvelocity. If the body be moving, and the power impressed act upon the\r\nbody in the direction of its motion, the body shall receive an addition\r\nto its motion, as great as the motion, into which that power would\r\nhave put it from a state of rest; but if the power impressed upon a\r\nmoving body act directly opposite to its former motion, that power\r\nshall then take away from the body’s motion, as much as in the other\r\ncase it would have added to it. Lastly, if the power be impressed\r\nobliquely, there will arise an oblique motion differing more or less\r\nfrom the former direction, according as the new impression is greater\r\nor less. For example, if the body A (in fig. 1.) be moving in the\r\ndirection A B, and when it is at the point A, a power be impressed upon\r\nit in the direction A C, the body shall from henceforth neither move\r\nin its first direction A B, nor in the direction of the adventitious\r\npower, but shall take a course as A D between them: and if the power\r\nlast impressed be just equal to that, which first gave to the body\r\nits motion; the line A D shall pass in the middle between A B and A\r\nC, dividing the angle under B A C into two equal parts; but if the\r\npower last impressed be greater than the first, the line A D shall\r\nincline most to A C; whereas if the last impression be less than the\r\nfirst, the line A D shall incline most to A B. To be more particular,\r\nthe situation of the line A D is always to be determined after this\r\nmanner. Let A E be the space, which the body would have moved through\r\nin the line A B during any certain portion of time; provided that body,\r\nwhen at A, had received no second impulse. Suppose likewise, that A F\r\nis the part of the line A C, through which the body would have moved\r\nduring an equal portion of time, if it had been at rest in A, when it\r\nreceived the impulse in the direction A C: then if from E be drawn a\r\nline parallel to, or equidistant from A C, and from F another line\r\nparallel to A B, those two lines will meet in the line A D.\r\n\r\n6. THE third and last of these laws of motion is, that when any body\r\nacts upon another, the action of that body upon the other is equalled\r\nby the contrary reaction of that other body upon the first.\r\n\r\n7. THESE laws of motion are abundantly confirmed by this, that all the\r\ndeductions made from them, in relation to the motion of bodies, how\r\ncomplicated soever, are found to agree perfectly with observation. This\r\nshall be shewn more at large in the next chapter. But before we proceed\r\nto so diffusive a proof; I chuse here to point out those appearances of\r\nbodies, whereby the laws of motion are first suggested to us.\r\n\r\n8. DAILY observation makes it appear to us, that any body, which we\r\nonce see at rest, never puts it self into fresh motion; but continues\r\nalways in the same place, till removed by some power applied to it.\r\n\r\n9. AGAIN, whenever a body is once in motion, it continues in that\r\nmotion some time after the moving power has quitted it, and it is left\r\nto it self. Now if the body continue to move but a single moment, after\r\nthe moving power has left it, there can no reason be assigned, why it\r\nshould ever stop without some external force. For it is plain, that\r\nthis continuance of the motion is caused only by the body’s having\r\nalready moved, the sole operation of the power upon the body being the\r\nputting it in motion; therefore that motion continued will equally be\r\nthe cause of its farther motion, and so on without end. The only doubt\r\nthat can remain, is, whether this motion communicated continues intire,\r\nafter the power, that caused it, ceases to act; or whether it does not\r\ngradually languish and decrease. And this suspicion cannot be removed\r\nby a transient and slight observation on bodies, but will be fully\r\ncleared up by those more accurate proofs of the laws of motion, which\r\nare to be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n10. LASTLY, bodies in motion appear to affect a straight course without\r\nany deviation, unless when disturbed by some adventitious power acting\r\nupon them. If a body be thrown perpendicularly upwards or downwards,\r\nit appears to continue in the same straight line during the whole time\r\nof its motion. If a body be thrown in any other direction, it is found\r\nto deviate from the line, in which it began to move, more and more\r\ncontinually towards the earth, whither it is directed by its weight:\r\nbut since, when the weight of a body does not alter the direction of\r\nits motion, it always moves in a straight line, without doubt in this\r\nother case the body’s, declining from its first course is no more,\r\nthan what is caused by its weight alone. As this appears at first\r\nsight to be unquestionable, so we shall have a very distinct proof\r\nthereof in the next chapter, where the oblique motion of bodies will be\r\nparticularly considered.\r\n\r\n11. THUS we see how the first of the laws of motion agrees with\r\nwhat appears to us in moving bodies. But here occurs this farther\r\nconsideration, that the real and absolute motion of any body is not\r\nvisible to us: for we are our selves also in constant motion along with\r\nthe earth whereon we dwell; insomuch that we perceive bodies to move\r\nso far only, as their motion is different from our own. When a body\r\nappears to us to lie at rest, in reality it only continues the motion,\r\nit has received, without putting forth any power to change that motion.\r\nIf we throw a body in the course or direction, wherein we are carried\r\nour selves; so much motion as we seem to have given to the body, so\r\nmuch we have truly added to the motion, it had, while it appeared to us\r\nto be at rest. But if we impel a body the contrary way, although the\r\nbody appears to us to have received by such an impulse as much motion,\r\nas when impelled the other way; yet in this case we have taken from the\r\nbody so much real motion, as we seem to have given it. Thus the motion,\r\nwhich we see in bodies, is not their real motion, but only relative\r\nwith respect to us; and the forementioned observations only shew us,\r\nthat this first law of motion has place in this relative or apparent\r\nmotion. However, though we cannot make any observation immediately on\r\nthe absolute motion of bodies, yet by reasoning upon what we observe\r\nin visible motion, we can discover the properties and effects of real\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n12. WITH regard to this first law of motion, which is now under\r\nconsideration, we may from the foregoing observations most truly\r\ncollect, that bodies are disposed to continue in the absolute motion,\r\nwhich they have once received, without increasing or diminishing their\r\nvelocity. When a body appears to us to lie at rest, it really preserves\r\nwithout change the motion, which it has in common with our selves:\r\nand when we put it into visible motion, and we see it continue that\r\nmotion; this proves, that the body retains that degree of its absolute\r\nmotion, into which it is put by our acting upon it: if we give it such\r\nan apparent motion, which adds to its real motion, it preserves that\r\naddition; and if our acting on the body takes off from its real motion,\r\nit continues afterwards to move with no more real motion, than we have\r\nleft it.\r\n\r\n13. AGAIN, we do not observe in bodies any disposition or power within\r\nthemselves to change the direction of their motion; and if they had any\r\nsuch power, it would easily be discovered. For suppose a body by the\r\nstructure or disposition of its parts, or by any other circumstance in\r\nits make, was indued with a power of moving it self; this self-moving\r\nprinciple, which should be thus inherent in the body, and not depend on\r\nany thing external, must change the direction wherein it would act, as\r\noften as the position of the body was changed: so that for instance,\r\nif a body was lying before me in such a position, that the direction,\r\nwherein this principle disposes the body to move, was pointed directly\r\nfrom me; if I then gradually turned the body about, the direction\r\nof this self-moving principle would no longer be pointed directly\r\nfrom me, but would turn about along with the body. Now if any body,\r\nwhich appears to us at rest, were furnished with any such self-moving\r\nprinciple; from the body’s appearing without motion we must conclude,\r\nthat this self-moving principle lies directed the same way as the\r\nearth is carrying the body; and such a body might immediately be put\r\ninto visible motion only by turning it about in any degree, that this\r\nself-moving principle might receive a different direction.\r\n\r\n14. FROM these considerations it very plainly follows, that if a body\r\nwere once absolutely at rest; not being furnished with any principle,\r\nwhereby it could put it self into motion, it must for ever continue in\r\nthe same place, till acted upon by something external: and also that\r\nwhen a body is put into motion, it has no power within it self to make\r\nany change in the direction of that motion; and consequently that the\r\nbody must move on straight forward without declining any way whatever.\r\nBut it has before been shewn, that bodies do not appear to have in\r\nthemselves any power to change the velocity of their motion: therefore\r\nthis first law of motion has been illustrated and confirmed, as much as\r\ncan be from the transient observations, which have here been discoursed\r\nupon; and in the next chapter all this will be farther established by\r\nmore correct observations.\r\n\r\n15. BUT I shall now pass to the second law of motion; wherein, when it\r\nis asserted, that the velocity, with which any body is moved by the\r\naction of a power upon it, is proportional to that power; the degree of\r\npower is supposed to be measured by the greatness of the body, which\r\nit can move with a given celerity. So that the sense of this law is,\r\nthat if any body were put into motion with that degree of swiftness, as\r\nto pass in one hour the length of a thousand yards; the power, which\r\nwould give the same degree of velocity to a body twice as great, would\r\ngive this lesser body twice the velocity, causing it to describe in the\r\nsame space of an hour two thousand yards. But by a body twice as great\r\nas another, I do not here mean simply of twice the bulk, but one that\r\ncontains a double quantity of solid matter.\r\n\r\n16. WHY the power, which can move a body twice as great as another with\r\nthe same degree of velocity, should be called twice as great as the\r\npower, which can give the lesser body the same velocity, is evident.\r\nFor if we should suppose the greater body to be divided into two equal\r\nparts, each equal to the lesser body, each of these halves will require\r\nthe same degree of power to move them with the velocity of the lesser\r\nbody, as the lesser body it self requires; and therefore both those\r\nhalves, or the whole greater body, will require the moving power to be\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\n17. THAT the moving power being in this sense doubled, should just\r\ndouble likewise the velocity of the same body, seems near as evident,\r\nif we consider, that the effect of the power applied must needs be\r\nthe same, whether that power be applied to the body at once, or in\r\nparts. Suppose then the double power not applied to the body at\r\nonce, but half of it first, and afterwards the other half; it is not\r\nconceivable for what reason the half last applied should come to have\r\na different effect upon the body, from that which is applied first;\r\nas it must have, if the velocity of the body was not just doubled by\r\nthe application of it. So far as experience can determine, we see\r\nnothing to favour such a supposition. We cannot indeed (by reason of\r\nthe constant motion of the earth) make trial upon any body perfectly at\r\nrest, whereby to see whether a power applied in that case would have a\r\ndifferent effect, from what it has, when the body is already moving;\r\nbut we find no alteration in the effect of the same power on account of\r\nany difference there may be in the motion of the body, when the power\r\nis applied. The earth does not always carry bodies with the same degree\r\nof velocity; yet we find the visible effects of any power applied to\r\nthe same body to be, at all times the very same: and a bale of goods,\r\nor other moveable body lying in a ship is as easily removed from place\r\nto place, while the ship is under sail, if its motion be steady, as\r\nwhen it is fixed at anchor.\r\n\r\n18. NOW this experience is alone sufficient to shew to us the whole of\r\nthis law of motion.\r\n\r\n19. SINCE we find, that the same power will always produce the same\r\nchange in the motion of any body, whether that body were before moving\r\nwith a swifter or slower motion; the change wrought in the motion of\r\na body depends only on the power applied to it, without any regard to\r\nthe body’s former motion: and therefore the degree of motion, which the\r\nbody already possesses, having no influence on the power applied to\r\ndisturb its operation, the effects of the same power will not only be\r\nthe same in all degrees of motion of the body; but we have likewise no\r\nreason to doubt, but that a body perfectly at rest would receive from\r\nany power as much motion, as would be equivalent to the effect of the\r\nsame power applied to that body already in motion.\r\n\r\n20. AGAIN, suppose a body being at rest, any number of equal powers\r\nshould be successively applied to it; pushing it forward from time to\r\ntime in the same course or direction. Upon the application of the first\r\npower the body would begin to move; when the second power was applied,\r\nit appears from what has been said, that the motion of the body would\r\nbecome double; the third power would treble the motion of the body; and\r\nso on, till after the operation of the last power the motion of the\r\nbody would be as many times the motion, which the first power gave it,\r\nas there are powers in number. and the effect of this number of powers\r\nwill be always the same, without any regard to the space of time taken\r\nup in applying them: so that greater or lesser intervals between the\r\napplication of each of these powers will produce no difference at all\r\nin their effects. Since therefore the distance of time between the\r\naction of each power is of no consequence; without doubt the effect\r\nwill still be the same, though the powers should all be applied at\r\nthe very same instant; or although a single power should be applied\r\nequal in strength to the collective force of all these powers. Hence\r\nit plainly follows, that the degree of motion, into which any body\r\nwill be put out of a state of rest by any power, will be proportional\r\nto that power. A double power will give twice the velocity, a treble\r\npower three times the velocity, and so on. The foregoing reasoning will\r\nequally take place, though the body were not supposed to be at rest,\r\nwhen the powers began to be applied to it; provided the direction, in\r\nwhich the powers were applied, either conspired with the action of\r\nthe body, or was directly opposite to it. Therefore if any power be\r\napplied to a moving body, and act upon the body either in the direction\r\nwherewith the body moves, so as to accelerate the body; or if it act\r\ndirectly opposite to the motion of the body, so as to retard it: in\r\nboth these cases the change of motion will be proportional to the\r\npower applied; nay, the augmentation of the motion in one case, and\r\nthe diminution thereof in the other, will be equal to that degree of\r\nmotion, into which the same power would put the body, had it been at\r\nrest, when the power was applied.\r\n\r\n21. FARTHER, a power may be so applied to a moving body, as to act\r\nobliquely to the motion of the body. And the effects of such an oblique\r\nmotion may be deduced from this observation; that as all bodies are\r\ncontinually moving along with the earth, we see that the visible\r\neffects of the same power are always the same, in whatever direction\r\nthe power acts: and therefore the visible effects of any power upon\r\na body, which seems only to be at rest, is always to appearance the\r\nsame as the real effect would be upon a body truly at rest. Now\r\nsuppose a body were moving along the line A B (in fig. 2.) and the eye\r\naccompanied it with an equal motion in the line C D equidistant from A\r\nB; so that when the body is at A, the eye shall be at C, and when the\r\nbody is advanced to E in the line A B, the eye shall be advanced to F\r\nin the line C D, the distances A E and C F being equal. It is evident,\r\nthat here the body will appear to the eye to be at rest; and the line\r\nF E G drawn from the eye through the body shall seem to the eye to be\r\nimmoveable; though as the body and eye move forward together, this\r\nline shall really also move; so that when the body shall be advanced\r\nto H and the eye to K, the line F E G shall be transferred into the\r\nsituation K H L, this line K H L being equidistant from F E G. Now\r\nif the body when at E were to receive an impulse in the direction of\r\nthe line F E G; while the eye is moving on from F to K and carrying\r\nalong with it the line F E G, the body will appear to the eye to move\r\nalong this line F E G: for this is what has just now been said; that\r\nwhile bodies are moving along with the earth, and the spectator’s eye\r\npartakes of the same motion, the effect of any power upon the body\r\nwill appear to be what it would really have been, had the body been\r\ntruly at rest, when the power was applied. From hence it follows, that\r\nwhen the eye is advanced to K, the body will appear somewhere in the\r\nline K H L. Suppose it appear in M; then it is manifest, from what has\r\nbeen premised at the beginning of this paragraph, that the distance H\r\nM is equal to what the body would have run upon the line E G, during\r\nthe time, wherein the eye has passed from F to K, provided that the\r\nbody had been at rest, when acted upon in E. If it be farther asked,\r\nafter what manner the body has moved from E to M? I answer, through a\r\nstraight line; for it has been shewn above in the explication of the\r\nfirst law of motion, that a moving body, from the time it is left to it\r\nself, will proceed on in one continued straight line.\r\n\r\n22. IF E N be taken equal to H M and N M be drawn; since H M is\r\nequidistant from E N, N M will be equidistant from E H. Therefore the\r\neffect of any power upon a moving body, when that power acts obliquely\r\nto the motion of the body, is to be determined in this manner. Suppose\r\nthe body is moving along the straight line A E B, if when the body is\r\ncome to E, a power gives it an impulse in the direction of the line E\r\nG, to find what course the body will afterwards take we must proceed\r\nthus. Take in E B any length E H, and in E G take such a length E N,\r\nthat if the body had been at rest in E, the power applied to it would\r\nhave caused it to move over E N in the same space of time, as it would\r\nhave employed in passing over E H, if the power had not acted at all\r\nupon it. Then draw H L equidistant from E G, and N M equidistant from\r\nE B. After this, if a line be drawn from E to the point M, where these\r\ntwo lines meet, the line E M will be the course into which the body\r\nwill be put by the action of the power upon it at E.\r\n\r\n23. A MATHEMATICAL reader would here expect in some particulars more\r\nregular demonstrations; but as I do not at present address my self to\r\nsuch, so I hope, what I have now written will render my meaning evident\r\nenough to those, who are unacquainted with that kind of reasoning.\r\n\r\n24. NOW as we have been shewing, that some actual force is necessary\r\neither to put bodies out of a state of rest into motion, or to change\r\nthe motion, which they have once received; it is proper here to\r\nobserve, that this quality in bodies, whereby they preserve their\r\npresent state, with regard to motion or rest, till some active force\r\ndisturb them, is called the ~VIS INERTIAE~ of matter: and\r\nby this property, matter, sluggish and unactive of it self, retains\r\nall the power impressed upon it, and cannot be made to cease from\r\naction, but by the opposition of as great a power, as that which first\r\nmoved it. By the degree of this ~VIS INERTIAE~, or power of\r\ninactivity, as we shall henceforth call it, we primarily judge of the\r\nquantity of solid matter in each body; for as this quality is inherent\r\nin all the bodies, upon which we can make any trial, we conclude it to\r\nbe a property essential to all matter; and as we yet know no reason\r\nto suppose, that bodies are composed of different kinds of matter, we\r\nrather presume, that the matter of all bodies is the same; and that\r\nthe degree of this power of inactivity is in every body proportional\r\nto the quantity of the solid matter in it. But although we have no\r\nabsolute proof, that all the matter in the universe is uniform, and\r\npossesses this power of inactivity in the same degree; yet we can with\r\ncertainty compare together the different degrees of this power of\r\ninactivity in different bodies. Particularly this power is proportional\r\nto the weight of bodies, as Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has demonstrated[44].\r\nHowever, notwithstanding that this power of inactivity in any body can\r\nbe more certainly known, than the quantity of solid matter in it; yet\r\nsince there is no reason to suspect that one is not proportional to\r\nthe other, we shall hereafter speak without hesitation of the quantity\r\nof matter in bodies, as the measure of the degree of their power of\r\ninactivity.\r\n\r\n25. THIS being established, we may now compare the effects of the\r\nsame power upon different bodies, as hitherto we have shewn the\r\neffects of different powers upon the same body. And here if we limit\r\nthe word motion to the peculiar sense given to it in philosophy, we\r\nmay comprehend all that is to be said upon this head under one short\r\nprecept; that the same power, to whatever body it is applied, will\r\nalways produce the same degree of motion. But here motion does not\r\nsignify the degree of celerity or velocity with which a body moves,\r\nin which sense only we have hitherto used it; but it is made use of\r\nparticularly in philosophy to signify the force with which a body\r\nmoves: as if two bodies A and B being in motion, twice the force\r\nwould be required to stop A as to stop B, the motion of A would be\r\nesteemed double the motion of B. In moving bodies, these two things are\r\ncarefully to be distinguished; their velocity or celerity, which is\r\nmeasured by the space they pass through during any determinate portion\r\nof time; and the quantity of their motion, or the force, with which\r\nthey will press against any resistance. Which force, when different\r\nbodies move with the same velocity, is proportional to the quantity of\r\nsolid matter in the bodies; but if the bodies are equal, this force is\r\nproportional to their respective velocities, and in other cases it is\r\nproportional both to the quantity of solid matter in the body, and also\r\nto its velocity. To instance in two bodies A and B: if A be twice as\r\ngreat as B, and they have both the same velocity, the motion of A shall\r\nbe double the motion of B; and if the bodies be equal, and the velocity\r\nof A be twice that of B, the motion of A shall likewise be double that\r\nof B; but if A be twice as large as B, and move twice as swift, the\r\nmotion of A will be four times the motion of B; and lastly, if A be\r\ntwice as large as B, and move but half as fast, the degree of their\r\nmotion shall be the same.\r\n\r\n26. THIS is the particular sense given to the word motion by\r\nphilosophers, and in this sense of the word the same power always\r\nproduces the same quantity or degree of motion. If the same power act\r\nupon two bodies A and B, the velocities, it shall give to each of them,\r\nshall be so adjusted to the respective bodies, that the same degree\r\nof motion shall be produced in each. If A be twice as great as B, its\r\nvelocity shall be half that of B; if A has three times as much solid\r\nmatter as B, the velocity of A shall be one third of the velocity of B;\r\nand generally the velocity given to A shall bear the same proportion to\r\nthe velocity given to B, as the quantity of solid matter contained in\r\nthe body B bears to the quantity of solid matter contained in A.\r\n\r\n27. THE reason of all this is evident from what has gone before. If\r\na power were applied to B, which should bear the same proportion to\r\nthe power applied to A, as the body B bears to A, the bodies B and\r\nA would both receive the same velocity; and the velocity, which B\r\nwill receive from this power, will bear the same proportion to the\r\nvelocity, which it would receive from the action of the power applied\r\nto A, as the former of these powers bears to the latter: that is, the\r\nvelocity, which A receives from the power applied to it, will bear\r\nto the velocity, which B would receive from the same power, the same\r\nproportion as the body B bears to A.\r\n\r\n28. FROM hence we may now pass to the third law of motion, where\r\nthis distinction between the velocity of a body and its whole motion\r\nis farther necessary to be regarded, as shall immediately be shewn;\r\nafter having first illustrated the meaning of this law by a familiar\r\ninstance. If a stone or other load be drawn by a horse; the load\r\nre-acts upon the horse, as much as the horse acts upon the load; for\r\nthe harness, which is strained between them, presses against the horse\r\nas much as against the load; and the progressive motion of the horse\r\nforward is hindred as much by the load, as the motion of the load is\r\npromoted by the endeavour of the horse: that is, if the horse put forth\r\nthe same strength, when loosened from the load, he would move himself\r\nforwards with greater swiftness in proportion to the difference between\r\nthe weight of his own body and the weight of himself and load together.\r\n\r\n29. THIS instance will afford some general notion of the meaning of\r\nthis law. But to proceed to a more philosophical explication: if a body\r\nin motion strike against another at rest, let the body striking be\r\never so small, yet shall it communicate some degree of motion to the\r\nbody it strikes against, though the less that body be in comparison\r\nof that it impinges upon, and the less the velocity is, with which\r\nit moves, the smaller will be the motion communicated. But whatever\r\ndegree of motion it gives to the resting body, the same it shall lose\r\nit self. This is the necessary consequence of the forementioned power\r\nof inactivity in matter. For suppose the two bodies equal, it is\r\nevident from the time they meet, both the bodies are to be moved by the\r\nsingle motion of the first; therefore the body in motion by means of\r\nits power of inactivity retaining the motion first given it, strikes\r\nupon the other with the same force, wherewith it was acted upon it\r\nself: but now both the bodies being to be moved by that force, which\r\nbefore moved one only, the ensuing velocity will be the same, as if the\r\npower, which was applied to one of the bodies, and put it into motion,\r\nhad been applied to both; whence it appears, that they will proceed\r\nforwards, with half the velocity, which the body first in motion had:\r\nthat is, the body first moved will have lost half its motion, and the\r\nother will have gained exactly as much. This rule is just, provided\r\nthe bodies keep contiguous after meeting; as they would always do, if\r\nit were not for a certain cause that often intervenes, and which must\r\nnow be explained. Bodies upon striking against each other, suffer an\r\nalteration in their figure, having their parts pressed inwards by the\r\nstroke, which for the most part recoil again afterwards, the bodies\r\nendeavouring to recover their former shape. This power, whereby bodies\r\nare inabled to regain their first figure, is usually called their\r\nelasticity, and when it acts, it forces the bodies from each other,\r\nand causes them to separate. Now the effect of this elasticity in the\r\npresent case is such, that if the bodies are perfectly elastic, so\r\nas to recoil with as great a force as they are bent with, that they\r\nrecover their figure in the same space of time, as has been taken up\r\nin the alteration made in it by their compression together; then this\r\npower will separate the bodies as swiftly, as they before approached,\r\nand acting upon both equally, upon the body first in motion contrary\r\nto the direction in which it moves, and upon the other as much in the\r\ndirection of its motion, it will take from the first, and add to the\r\nother equal degrees of velocity: so that the power being strong enough\r\nto separate them with as great a velocity, as they approached with, the\r\nfirst will be quite stopt, and that which was at rest, will receive all\r\nthe motion of the other. If the bodies are elastic in a less degree,\r\nthe first will not lose all its motion, nor will the other acquire\r\nthe motion of the first, but fall as much short of it, as the other\r\nretains. For this rule is never deviated from, that though the degree\r\nof elasticity determines how much more than half its velocity the body\r\nfirst in motion shall lose; yet in every case the loss in the motion\r\nof this body shall be transferred to the other, that other body always\r\nreceiving by the stroke as much motion, as is taken from the first.\r\n\r\n30. This is the case of a body striking directly against an equal body\r\nat rest, and the reasoning here used is fully confirmed by experience.\r\nThere are many other cases of bodies impinging against one another: but\r\nthe mention of these shall be reserved to the next chapter, where we\r\nintend to be more particular and diffusive in the proof of these laws\r\nof motion, than we have been here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nFarther proofs of the LAWS OF MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING in the preceding chapter deduced the three laws of motion,\r\ndelivered by our great philosopher, from the most obvious observations,\r\nthat suggest them to us; I now intend to give more particular proofs\r\nof them, by recounting some of the discoveries which have been made in\r\nphilosophy before Sir Isaac Newton. For as they were all collected by\r\nreasoning upon those laws; so the conformity of these discoveries to\r\nexperience makes them so many proofs of the truth of the principles,\r\nfrom which they were derived.\r\n\r\n2. LET us begin with the subject, which concluded the last chapter.\r\nAlthough the body in motion be not equal to the body at rest, on which\r\nit strikes; yet the motion after the stroke is to be estimated in the\r\nsame manner as above. Let A (in fig. 3.) be a body in motion towards\r\nanother body B lying at rest. When A is arrived at B, it cannot proceed\r\nfarther without putting B into motion; and what motion it gives to\r\nB, it must lose it self, that the whole degree of motion of A and B\r\ntogether, if neither of the bodies be elastic, shall be equal, after\r\nthe meeting of the bodies, to the single motion of A before the stroke.\r\nTherefore, from what has been said above, it is manifest, that as soon\r\nas the two bodies are met, they will move on together with a velocity,\r\nwhich will bear the same proportion to the original velocity of A, as\r\nthe body A bears to the sum of both the bodies.\r\n\r\n3. IF the bodies are elastic, so that they shall separate after the\r\nstroke, A must lose a greater part of its motion, and the subsequent\r\nmotion of B will be augmented by this elasticity, as much as the motion\r\nof A is diminished by it. The elasticity acting equally between both\r\nthe bodies, it will communicate to each the same degree of motion; that\r\nis, it will separate the bodies by taking from the body A and adding\r\nto the body B different degrees of velocity, so proportioned to their\r\nrespective quantities of matter, that the degree of motion, wherewith\r\nA separates from B, shall be equal to the degree of motion, wherewith\r\nB separates from A. It follows therefore, that the velocity taken from\r\nA by the elasticity bears to the velocity, which the same elasticity\r\nadds to B, the same proportion, as B bears to A: consequently the\r\nvelocity, which the elasticity takes from A, will bear the same\r\nproportion to the whole velocity, wherewith this elasticity causes the\r\ntwo bodies to separate from each other, as the body B bears to the sum\r\nof the two bodies A and B; and the velocity, which is added to B by the\r\nelasticity, bears to the velocity, wherewith the bodies separate, the\r\nsame proportion, as the body A bears to the sum of the two bodies A\r\nand B. Thus is found, how much the elasticity takes from the velocity\r\nof A, and adds to the velocity of B; provided the degree of elasticity\r\nbe known, whereby to determine the whole velocity wherewith the bodies\r\nseparate from each other after the stroke[45].\r\n\r\n4. AFTER this manner is determined in every case the result of a body\r\nin motion striking against another at rest. The same principles will\r\nalso determine the effects, when both bodies are in motion.\r\n\r\n5. LET two equal bodies move against each other with equal swiftness.\r\nThen the force, with which each of them presses forwards, being equal\r\nwhen they strike; each pressing in its own direction with the same\r\nenergy, neither shall surmount the other, but both be stopt, if they\r\nbe not elastic: for if they be elastic, they shall from thence recover\r\nnew motion, and recede from each other, as swiftly as they met, if they\r\nbe perfectly elastic; but more slowly, if less so. In the same manner,\r\nif two bodies of unequal bigness strike against each other, and their\r\nvelocities be so related, that the velocity of the lesser body shall\r\nexceed the velocity of the greater in the same proportion, as the\r\ngreater body exceeds the lesser (for instance, if one body contains\r\ntwice the solid matter as the other, and moves but half as fast) two\r\nsuch bodies will entirely suppress each other’s motion, and remain from\r\nthe time of their meeting fixed; if, as before, they are not elastic:\r\nbut, if they are so in the highest degree, they shall recede again,\r\neach with the same velocity, wherewith they met. For this elastic\r\npower, as in the preceding case, shall renew their motion, and pressing\r\nequally upon both, shall give the same motion to both; that is, shall\r\ncause the velocity, which the lesser body receives, to bear the same\r\nproportion to the velocity, which the greater receives, as the greater\r\nbody bears to the lesser: so that the velocities shall bear the same\r\nproportion to each other after the stroke, as before. Therefore if the\r\nbodies, by being perfectly elastic, have the sum of their velocities\r\nafter the stroke equal to the sum of their velocities before the\r\nstroke, each body after the stroke will receive its first velocity.\r\nAnd the same proportion will hold likewise between the velocities,\r\nwherewith they go off, though they are elastic but in a less degree;\r\nonly then the velocity of each will be less in proportion to the defect\r\nof elasticity.\r\n\r\n6. IF the velocities, wherewith the bodies meet, are not in the\r\nproportion here supposed; but if one of the bodies, as A, has a swifter\r\nvelocity in comparison to the velocity of the other; then the effect\r\nof this excess of velocity in the body A must be joined to the effect\r\nnow mentioned, after the manner of this following example. Let A be\r\ntwice as great as B, and move with the same swiftness as B. Here A\r\nmoves with twice that degree of swiftness, which would answer to the\r\nforementioned proportion. For A being double to B, if it moved but\r\nwith half the swiftness, wherewith B advances, it has been just now\r\nshewn, that the two bodies upon meeting would stop, if they were not\r\nelastic; and if they were elastic, that they would each recoil, so as\r\nto cause A to return with half the velocity, wherewith B would return.\r\nBut it is evident from hence, that B by encountring A will annul half\r\nits velocity, if the bodies be not elastic; and the future motion of\r\nthe bodies will be the same, as if A had advanced against B at rest\r\nwith half the velocity here assigned to it. If the bodies be elastic,\r\nthe velocity of A and B after the stroke may be thus discovered. As\r\nthe two bodies advance against each other, the velocity, with which\r\nthey meet, is made up of the velocities of both bodies added together.\r\nAfter the stroke their elasticity will separate them again. The degree\r\nof elasticity will determine what proportion the velocity, wherewith\r\nthey separate, must bear to that, wherewith they meet. Divide this\r\nvelocity, with which the bodies separate into two parts, that one of\r\nthe parts bear to the other the same proportion, as the body A bears to\r\nB; and ascribe the lesser part to the greater body A, and the greater\r\npart of the velocity to the lesser body B. Then take the part ascribed\r\nto A from the common velocity, which A and B would have had after the\r\nstroke, if they had not been elastic; and add the part ascribed to B to\r\nthe same common velocity. By this means the true velocities of A and B\r\nafter the stroke will be made known.\r\n\r\n7. IF the bodies are perfectly elastic, the great ~HUYGENS~\r\nhas laid down this rule for finding their motion after concourse[46].\r\nAny straight line C D (in fig. 4, 5.) being drawn, let it be divided\r\nin E, that C E bear the same proportion to E D, as the swiftness of A\r\nbore to the swiftness of B before the stroke. Let the same line C D be\r\nalso divided in F, that C F bear the same proportion to F D, as the\r\nbody B bears to the body A. Then F G being taken equal to F E, if the\r\npoint G falls within the line C D, both the bodies shall recoil after\r\nthe stroke, and the velocity, wherewith the body A shall return, will\r\nbear the same proportion to the velocity, wherewith B shall return, as\r\nG C bears to G D; but if the point G falls without the line C D, then\r\nthe bodies after their concourse shall both proceed to move the same\r\nway, and the velocity of A shall bear to the velocity of B the same\r\nproportion, that G C bears to G D, as before.\r\n\r\n8. IF the body B had stood still, and received the impulse of the other\r\nbody A upon it; the effect has been already explained in the case, when\r\nthe bodies are not elastic. And when they are elastic, the result of\r\ntheir collision is found by combining the effect of the elasticity with\r\nthe other effect, in the same manner as in the last case.\r\n\r\n9. WHEN the bodies are perfectly elastic, the rule of\r\n~HUYGENS~[47] here is to divide the line C D (fig. 6.) in E as\r\nbefore, and to take E G equal to E D. And by these points thus found,\r\nthe motion of each body after the stroke is determined, as before.\r\n\r\n10. IN the next place, suppose the bodies A and B were both moving the\r\nsame way, but A with a swifter motion, so as to overtake B, and strike\r\nagainst it. The effect of the percussion or stroke, when the bodies are\r\nnot elastic, is discovered by finding the common motion, which the two\r\nbodies would have after the stroke, if B were at rest, and A were to\r\nadvance against it with a velocity equal to the excess of the present\r\nvelocity of A above the velocity of B; and by adding to this common\r\nvelocity thus found the velocity of B.\r\n\r\n11. IF the bodies are elastic, the effect of the elasticity is to be\r\nunited with this other, as in the former cases.\r\n\r\n12. WHEN the bodies are perfectly elastic, the rule of HUYGENS[48] in\r\nthis case is to prolong C D (fig. 7.) and to take in it thus prolonged\r\nC E in the same proportion to E D, as the greater velocity of A bears\r\nto the lesser velocity of B; after which F G being taken equal to F E,\r\nthe velocities of the two bodies after the stroke will be determined,\r\nas in the two preceding cases.\r\n\r\n13. THUS I have given the sum of what has been written concerning the\r\neffects of percussion, when two bodies freely in motion strike directly\r\nagainst each other; and the results here set down, as the consequence\r\nof our reasoning from the laws of motion, answer most exactly to\r\nexperience. A particular set of experiments has been invented to make\r\ntrial of these effects of percussion with the greatest exactness. But\r\nI must defer these experiments, till I have explained the nature of\r\npendulums[49]. I shall therefore now proceed to describe some of the\r\nappearances, which are caused in bodies from the influence of the power\r\nof gravity united with the general laws of motion; among which the\r\nmotion of the pendulum will be included.\r\n\r\n14. THE most simple of these appearances is, when bodies fall down\r\nmerely by their weight. In this case the body increases continually\r\nits velocity, during the whole time of its fall, and that in the very\r\nsame proportion as the time increases. For the power of gravity acts\r\nconstantly on the body with the same degree of strength: and it has\r\nbeen observed above in the first law of motion, that a body being once\r\nin motion will perpetually preserve that motion without the continuance\r\nof any external influence upon it: therefore, after a body has been\r\nonce put in motion by the force of gravity, the body would continue\r\nthat motion, though the power of gravity should cease to act any\r\nfarther upon it; but, if the power of gravity continues still to draw\r\nthe body down, fresh degrees of motion must continually be added to\r\nthe body; and the power of gravity acting at all times with the same\r\nstrength, equal degrees of motion will constantly be added in equal\r\nportions of time.\r\n\r\n15. THIS conclusion is not indeed absolutely true: for we shall find\r\nhereafter[50], that the power of gravity is not of the same strength at\r\nall distances from the center of the earth. But nothing of this is in\r\nthe least sensible in any distance, to which we can convey bodies. The\r\nweight of bodies is the very same to sense upon the highest towers or\r\nmountains, as upon the level ground; so that in all the observations\r\nwe can make, the forementioned proportion between the velocity of a\r\nfalling body and the time, in which it has been descending, obtains\r\nwithout any the least perceptible difference.\r\n\r\n16. FROM hence it follows, that the space, through which a body falls,\r\nis not proportional to the time of the fall; for since the body\r\nincreases its velocity, a greater space will be passed over in the same\r\nportion of time at the latter part of the fall, than at the beginning.\r\nSuppose a body let fall from the point A (in fig. 8.) were to descend\r\nfrom A to B in any portion of time; then if in an equal portion of time\r\nit were to proceed from B to C; I say, the space B C is greater than A\r\nB; so that the time of the fall from A to C being double the time of\r\nthe fall from A to B, A C shall be more than double of A B.\r\n\r\n17. THE geometers have proved, that the spaces, through which bodies\r\nfall thus by their weight, are just in a duplicate or two-fold\r\nproportion of the times, in which the body has been falling. That is,\r\nif we were to take the line D E in the same proportion to A B, as the\r\ntime, which the body has imployed in falling from A to C, bears to the\r\ntime of the fall from A to B; then A C will be to D E in the same\r\nproportion. In particular, if the time of the fall through A C be twice\r\nthe time of the fall through A B; then D E will be twice A B, and A C\r\ntwice D E; or A C four times A B. But if the time of the fall through\r\nA C had been thrice the time of the fall through A B; D E would have\r\nbeen treble of A B, and A C treble of D E; that is, A C would have been\r\nequal to nine times A B.\r\n\r\n18. IF a body fall obliquely, it will approach the ground by slower\r\ndegrees, than when it falls perpendicularly. Suppose two lines A B, A\r\nC (in fig. 9.) were drawn, one perpendicular, and the other oblique to\r\nthe ground D E: then if a body were to descend in the slanting line\r\nA C; because the power of gravity draws the body directly downwards,\r\nif the line A C supports the body from falling in that manner, it\r\nmust take off part of the effect of the power of gravity; so that\r\nin the time, which would have been sufficient for the body to have\r\nfallen through the whole perpendicular line A B, the body shall not\r\nhave passed in the line A C a length equal to A B; consequently the\r\nline A C being longer than A B, the body shall most certainly take up\r\nmore time in passing through A C, than it would have done in falling\r\nperpendicularly down through A B.\r\n\r\n19. THE geometers demonstrate, that the time, in which the body\r\nwill descend through the oblique straight line A C, bears the same\r\nproportion to the time of its descent through the perpendicular A B,\r\nas the line it self A C bears to A B. And in respect to the velocity,\r\nwhich the body will have acquired in the point C, they likewise\r\nprove, that the length of the time imployed in the descent through A\r\nC so compensates the diminution of the influence of gravity from the\r\nobliquity of this line, that though the force of the power of gravity\r\non the body is opposed by the obliquity of the line A C, yet the time\r\nof the body’s descent shall be so much prolonged, that the body shall\r\nacquire the very same velocity in the point C, as it would have got at\r\nthe point B by falling perpendicularly down.\r\n\r\n20. IF a body were to descend in a crooked line, the time of its\r\ndescent cannot be determined in so simple a manner; but the same\r\nproperty, in relation to the velocity, is demonstrated to take place in\r\nall cases: that is, in whatever line the body descends, the velocity\r\nwill always be answerable to the perpendicular height, from which the\r\nbody has fell. For instance, suppose the body A (in fig. 10.) were hung\r\nby a string to the pin B. If this body were let fall, till it came to\r\nthe point C perpendicularly under B, it will have moved from A to C in\r\nthe arch of a circle. Then the horizontal line A D being drawn, the\r\nvelocity of the body in C will be the same, as if it had fallen from\r\nthe point D directly down to C.\r\n\r\n21. IF a body be thrown perpendicularly upward with any force, the\r\nvelocity, wherewith the body ascends, shall continually diminish,\r\ntill at length it be wholly taken away; and from that time the body\r\nwill begin to fall down again, and pass over a second time in its\r\ndescent the line, wherein it ascended; falling through this line with\r\nan increasing velocity in such a manner, that in every point thereof,\r\nthrough which it falls, it shall have the very same velocity, as it\r\nhad in the same place, when it ascended; and consequently shall come\r\ndown into the place, whence it first ascended, with the velocity which\r\nwas at first given to it. Thus if a body were thrown perpendicularly\r\nup in the line A B (in fig. II.) with such a force, as that it should\r\nstop at the point B, and there begin to fall again; when it shall have\r\narrived in its descent to any point as C in this line, it shall there\r\nhave the same velocity, as that wherewith it passed by this point C\r\nin its ascent; and at the point A it shall have gained as great a\r\nvelocity, as that wherewith it was first thrown upwards. As this is\r\ndemonstrated by the geometrical writers; so, I think, it will appear\r\nevident, by considering only, that while the body descends, the power\r\nof gravity must act over again, in an inverted order, all the influence\r\nit had on the body in its ascent; so as to give again to the body the\r\nsame degrees of velocity, which it had taken away before.\r\n\r\n22. AFTER the same manner, if the body were thrown upwards in the\r\noblique straight line C A (in fig. 9.) from the point C, with such a\r\ndegree of velocity as just to reach the point A; it shall by its own\r\nweight return again through the line A C by the same degrees, as it\r\nascended.\r\n\r\n23. AND lastly, if a body were thrown with any velocity in a line\r\ncontinually incurvated upwards, the like effect will be produced upon\r\nits return to the point, whence it was thrown. Suppose for instance,\r\nthe body A (in fig. 12.) were hung by a string A B. Then if this body\r\nbe impelled any way, it must move in the arch of a circle. Let it\r\nreceive such an impulse, as shall cause it to move in the arch A C; and\r\nlet this impulse be of such strength, that the body may be carried from\r\nA as far as D, before its motion is overcome by its weight: I say here,\r\nthat the body forthwith returning from D, shall come again into the\r\npoint A with the same velocity, as that wherewith it began to move.\r\n\r\n24. IT will be proper in this place to observe concerning the power of\r\ngravity, that its force upon any body does not at all depend upon the\r\nshape of the body; but that it continues constantly the same without\r\nany variation in the same body, whatever change be made in the figure\r\nof the body: and if the body be divided into any number of pieces,\r\nall those pieces shall weigh just the same, as they did, when united\r\ntogether in one body: and if the body be of a uniform contexture,\r\nthe weight of each piece will be proportional to its bulk. This has\r\ngiven reason to conclude, that the power of gravity acts upon bodies\r\nin proportion to the quantity of matter in them. Whence it should\r\nfollow, that all bodies must fall from equal heights in the same space\r\nof time. And as we evidently see the contrary in feathers and such\r\nlike substances, which fall very slowly in comparison of more solid\r\nbodies; it is reasonable to suppose, that some other cause concurs to\r\nmake so manifest a difference. This cause has been found by particular\r\nexperiments to be the air. The experiments for this purpose are made\r\nthus. They set up a very tall hollow glass; within which near the top\r\nthey lodge a feather and some very ponderous body, usually a piece\r\nof gold, this metal being the most weighty of any body known to us.\r\nThis glass they empty of the air contained within it, and by moving a\r\nwire, which passes through the top of the glass, they let the feather\r\nand the heavy body fall together; and it is always found, that as the\r\ntwo bodies begin to descend at the same time, so they accompany each\r\nother in the fall, and come to the bottom at the very same instant,\r\nas near as the eye can judge. Thus, as far as this experiment can be\r\ndepended on, it is certain, that the effect of the power of gravity\r\nupon each body is proportional to the quantity of solid matter, or\r\nto the power of inactivity in each body. For in the limited sense,\r\nwhich we have given above to the word motion, it has been shown, that\r\nthe same force gives to all bodies the same degree of motion, and\r\ndifferent forces communicate different degrees of motion proportional\r\nto the respective powers[51]. In this case, if the power of gravity\r\nwere to act equally upon the feather, and upon the more solid body,\r\nthe solid body would descend so much slower than the feather, as to\r\nhave no greater degree of motion than the feather: but as both bodies\r\ndescend with equal swiftness, the degree of motion in the solid body is\r\ngreater than in the feather, bearing the same proportion to it, as the\r\nquantity of matter in the solid body to the quantity of matter in the\r\nfeather. Therefore the effect of gravity on the solid body is greater\r\nthan on the feather, in proportion to the greater degree of motion\r\ncommunicated; that is, the effect of the power of gravity on the solid\r\nbody bears the same proportion to its effect on the feather, as the\r\nquantity of matter in the solid body bears to the quantity of matter\r\nin the feather. Thus it is the proper deduction from this experiment,\r\nthat the power of gravity acts not on the surface of bodies only, but\r\npenetrates the bodies themselves most intimately, and operates alike\r\non every particle of matter in them. But as the great quickness, with\r\nwhich the bodies fall, leaves it something uncertain, whether they do\r\ndescend absolutely in the same time, or only so nearly together, that\r\nthe difference in their swift motion is not discernable to the eye;\r\nthis property of the power of gravity, which has here been deduced from\r\nthis experiment, is farther confirmed by pendulums, whose motion is\r\nsuch, that a very minute difference would become sufficiently sensible.\r\nThis will be farther discoursed on in another place[52]; but here I\r\nshall make use of the principle now laid down to explain the nature of\r\nwhat is called the center of gravity in bodies.\r\n\r\n25. THE center of gravity is that point, by which if a body be\r\nsuspended, it shall hang at rest in any situation. In a globe of a\r\nuniform texture the center of gravity is the same with the center of\r\nthe globe; for as the parts of the globe on every side of its center\r\nare similarly disposed, and the power of gravity acts alike on every\r\npart; it is evident, that the parts of the globe on each side of the\r\ncenter are drawn with equal force, and therefore neither side can\r\nyield to the other; but the globe, if supported at its center, must\r\nof necessity hang at rest. In like manner, if two equal bodies A and\r\nB (in fig. 13.) be hung at the extremities of an inflexible rod C D,\r\nwhich should have no weight; these bodies, if the rod be supported at\r\nits middle E, shall equiponderate; and the rod remain without motion.\r\nFor the bodies being equal and at the same distance from the point of\r\nsupport E, the power of gravity will act upon each with equal strength,\r\nand in all respects under the same circumstances; therefore the weight\r\nof one cannot overcome the weight of the other. The weight of A can no\r\nmore surmount the weight of B, than the weight of B can surmount the\r\nweight of A. Again, suppose a body as A B (in fig. 14.) of a uniform\r\ntexture in the form of a roller, or as it is more usually called a\r\ncylinder, lying horizontally. If a straight line be drawn between C and\r\nD, the centers of the extreme circles of this cylinder; and if this\r\nstraight line, commonly called the axis of the cylinder, be divided\r\ninto two equal parts in E: this point E will be the center of gravity\r\nof the cylinder. The cylinder being a uniform figure, the parts on each\r\nside of the point E are equal, and situated in a perfectly similar\r\nmanner; therefore this cylinder, if supported at the point E, must hang\r\nat rest, for the same reason as the inflexible rod above-mentioned\r\nwill remain without motion, when suspended at its middle point. And it\r\nis evident, that the force applied to the point E, which would uphold\r\nthe cylinder, must be equal to the cylinder’s weight. Now suppose two\r\ncylinders of equal thickness A B and C D to be joined together at C B,\r\nso that the two axis’s E F, and F G lie in one straight line. Let the\r\naxis E F be divided into two equal parts at H, and the axis F G into\r\ntwo equal parts at I. Then because the cylinder A B would be upheld\r\nat rest by a power applied in H equal to the weight of this cylinder,\r\nand the cylinder C D would likewise be upheld by a power applied in I\r\nequal to the weight of this cylinder; the whole cylinder A D will be\r\nsupported by these two powers: but the whole cylinder may likewise be\r\nsupported by a power applied to K, the middle point of the whole axis\r\nE G, provided that power be equal to the weight of the whole cylinder.\r\nIt is evident therefore, that this power applied in K will produce the\r\nsame effect, as the two other powers applied in H and I. It is farther\r\nto be observed, that H K is equal to half F G, and K I equal to half\r\nE F; for E K being equal to half E G, and E H equal to half E F, the\r\nremainder H K must be equal to half the remainder F G; so likewise G\r\nK being equal to half G E, and G I equal to half G F, the remainder I\r\nK must be equal to half the remainder E F. It follows therefore, that\r\nH K bears the same proportion to K I, as F G bears to E F. Besides,\r\nI believe, my readers will perceive, and it is demonstrated in form\r\nby the geometers, that the whole body of the cylinder C D bears the\r\nsame proportion to the whole body of the cylinder A B, as the axis F G\r\nbears to the axis E F[53]. But hence it follows, that in the two powers\r\napplied at H and I, the power applied at H bears the same proportion to\r\nthe power applied at I, as K I bears to K H. Now suppose two strings\r\nH L and I M extended upwards, one from the point H and the other from\r\nI, and to be laid hold on by two powers, one strong enough to hold up\r\nthe cylinder A B, and the other of strength sufficient to support the\r\ncylinder C D. Here as these two powers uphold the whole cylinder, and\r\ntherefore produce an effect, equal to what would have been produced\r\nby a power applied to the point K of sufficient force to sustain the\r\nwhole cylinder: it is manifest, that if the cylinder be taken away,\r\nthe axis only being left, and from the point K a string, as K N, be\r\nextended, which shall be drawn down by a power equivalent to the weight\r\nof the cylinder, this power shall act against the other two powers, as\r\nmuch as the cylinder acted against them; and consequently these three\r\npowers shall be upon a balance, and hold the axis H I fixed between\r\nthem. But if these three powers preserve a mutual balance, the two\r\npowers applied to the strings H L and I M are a balance to each other;\r\nthe power applied to the string H L bearing the same proportion to\r\nthe power applied to the string I M, as the distance I K bears to the\r\ndistance K H. Hence it farther appears, that if an inflexible rod A B\r\n(in fig. 15.) be suspended by any point C not in the middle thereof;\r\nand if at A the end of the shorter arm be hung a weight, and at B\r\nthe end of the longer arm be also hung a weight less than the other,\r\nand that the greater of these weights bears to the lesser the same\r\nproportion, as the longer arm of the rod bears to the shorter; then\r\nthese two weights will equiponderate: for a power applied at C equal to\r\nboth these weights will support without motion the rod thus charged;\r\nsince here nothing is changed from the preceding case but the situation\r\nof the powers, which are now placed on the contrary sides of the line,\r\nto which they are fixed. Also for the same reason, if two weights A\r\nand B (in fig. 16.) were connected together by an inflexible rod C D,\r\ndrawn from C the center of gravity of A to D the center of gravity of\r\nB; and if the rod C D were to be so divided in E, that the part D E\r\nbear the same proportion to the other part C E, as the weight A bears\r\nto the weight B: then this rod being supported at E will uphold the\r\nweights, and keep them at rest without motion. This point E, by which\r\nthe two bodies A and B will be supported, is called their common center\r\nof gravity. And if a greater number of bodies were joined together,\r\nthe point, by which they could all be supported, is called the common\r\ncenter of gravity of them all. Suppose (in fig. 17.) there were three\r\nbodies A, B, C, whose respective centers of gravity were joined by the\r\nthree lines D E, D F, E F: the line D E being so divided in G, that D\r\nG bear the same proportion to G E, as B bears to A; G is the center\r\nof gravity common to the two bodies A and B; that is, a power equal\r\nto the weight of both the bodies applied to G would support them, and\r\nthe point G is pressed as much by the two weights A and B, as it would\r\nbe, if they were both hung together at that point. Therefore, if a\r\nline be drawn from G to F, and divided in H, so that G H bear the same\r\nproportion to H F, as the weight C bears to both the weights A and\r\nB, the point H will be the common center of gravity of all the three\r\nweights; for H would be their common center of gravity, if both the\r\nweights A and B were hung together at G, and the point G is pressed as\r\nmuch by them in their present situation, as it would be in that case.\r\nIn the same manner from the common center of these three weights, you\r\nmight proceed to find the common center, if a fourth weight were added,\r\nand by a gradual progress might find the common center of gravity\r\nbelonging to any number of weights whatever.\r\n\r\n26. AS all this is the obvious consequence of the proposition laid down\r\nfor assigning the common center of gravity of any two weights, by the\r\nsame proposition the center of gravity of all figures is found. In a\r\ntriangle, as A B C (in fig. 18.) the center of gravity lies in the line\r\ndrawn from the middle point of any one of the sides to the opposite\r\nangle, as the line B D is drawn from D the middle of the line A C to\r\nthe opposite angle B[54]; so that if from the middle of either of the\r\nother sides, as from the point E in the side A B, a line be drawn, as\r\nE C, to the opposite angle; the point F, where this line crosses the\r\nother line B D, will be the center of gravity of the triangle[55].\r\nLikewise D F is equal to half F B, and E F equal to half F C[56]. In a\r\nhemisphere, as A B C (fig. 19.) if from D the center of the base the\r\nline D B be erected perpendicular to that base, and this line be so\r\ndivided in E, that D E be equal to three fifths of B E, the point E is\r\nthe center of gravity of the hemisphere[57].\r\n\r\n27. IT will be of use to observe concerning the center of gravity of\r\nbodies; that since a power applied to this center alone can support\r\na body against the power of gravity, and hold it fixed at rest; the\r\neffect of the power of gravity on a body is the same, as if that whole\r\npower were to exert itself on the center of gravity only. Whence it\r\nfollows, that, when the power of gravity acts on a body suspended by\r\nany point, if the body is so suspended, that the center of gravity\r\nof the body can descend; the power of gravity will give motion to\r\nthat body, otherwise not: or if a number of bodies are so connected\r\ntogether, that, when any one is put into motion, the rest shall, by\r\nthe manner of their being joined, receive such motion, as shall keep\r\ntheir common center of gravity at rest; then the power of gravity\r\nshall not be able to produce any motion in these bodies, but in all\r\nother cases it will. Thus, if the body A B (in fig. 20, 21.) whose\r\ncenter of gravity is C, be hung on the point A, and the center C be\r\nperpendicularly under A (as in fig. 20.) the weight of the body will\r\nhold it still without motion, because the center C cannot descend any\r\nlower. But if the body be removed into any other situation, where the\r\ncenter C is not perpendicularly under A (as in fig. 21.) the body by\r\nits weight will be put into motion towards the perpendicular situation\r\nof its center of gravity. Also if two bodies A, B (in fig. 22.) be\r\njoined together by the rod C D lying in an horizontal situation, and\r\nbe supported at the point E; if this point be the center of gravity\r\ncommon to the two bodies, their weight will not put them into motion;\r\nbut if this point E is not their common center of gravity, the bodies\r\nwill move; that part of the rod C D descending, in which the common\r\ncenter of gravity is found. So in like manner, if these two bodies were\r\nconnected together by any more complex contrivance; yet if one of\r\nthe bodies cannot move without so moving the other, that their common\r\ncenter of gravity shall rest, the weight of the bodies will not put\r\nthem in motion, otherwise it will.\r\n\r\n28. I SHALL proceed in the next place to speak of the mechanical\r\npowers. These are certain instruments or machines, contrived for the\r\nmoving great weights with small force; and their effects are all\r\ndeducible from the observation we have just been making. They are\r\nusually reckoned in number five; the lever, the wheel and axis, the\r\npulley, the wedge, and the screw; to which some add the inclined\r\nplane. As these instruments have been of very ancient use, so the\r\ncelebrated ~ARCHIMEDES~ seems to have been the first, who discovered\r\nthe true reason of their effects. This, I think, may be collected\r\nfrom what is related of him, that some expressions, which he used to\r\ndenote the unlimited force of these instruments, were received as very\r\nextraordinary paradoxes: whereas to those, who had understood the cause\r\nof their great force, no expressions of that kind could have appeared\r\nsurprizing.\r\n\r\n29. ALL the effects of these powers may be judged of by this one rule,\r\nthat, when two weights are applied to any of these instruments, the\r\nweights will equiponderate, if, when put into motion, their velocities\r\nwill be reciprocally proportional to their respective weights. And what\r\nis said of weights, must of necessity be equally understood of any\r\nother forces equivalent to weights, such as the force of a man’s arm,\r\na stream of water, or the like.\r\n\r\n30. BUT to comprehend the meaning of this rule, the reader must know,\r\nwhat is to be understood by reciprocal proportion; which I shall now\r\nendeavour to explain, as distinctly as I can; for I shall be obliged\r\nvery frequently to make use of this term. When any two things are so\r\nrelated, that one increases in the same proportion as the other, they\r\nare directly proportional. So if any number of men can perform in a\r\ndetermined space of time a certain quantity of any work, suppose drain\r\na fish-pond, or the like; and twice the number of men can perform twice\r\nthe quantity of the same work, in the same time; and three times the\r\nnumber of men can perform as soon thrice the work; here the number\r\nof men and the quantity of the work are directly proportional. On\r\nthe other hand, when two things are so related, that one decreases\r\nin the same proportion, as the other increases, they are said to be\r\nreciprocally proportional. Thus if twice the number of men can perform\r\nthe same work in half the time, and three times the number of men can\r\nfinish the same in a third part of the time; then the number of men\r\nand the time are reciprocally proportional. We shewed above[58] how to\r\nfind the common center of gravity of two bodies, there the distances of\r\nthat common center from the centers of gravity of the two bodies are\r\nreciprocally proportional to the respective bodies. For C E in fig. 16.\r\nbeing in the same proportion to E D, as B bears to A; C E is so much\r\ngreater in proportion than E D, as A is less in proportion than B.\r\n\r\n31. NOW this being understood, the reason of the rule here stated will\r\neasily appear. For if these two bodies were put in motion, while the\r\npoint E rested, the velocity, wherewith A would move, would bear the\r\nsame proportion to the velocity, wherewith B would move, as E C bears\r\nto E D. The velocity therefore of each body, when the common center of\r\ngravity rests, is reciprocally proportional to the body. But we have\r\nshewn above[59], that if two bodies are so connected together, that the\r\nputting them in motion will not move their common center of gravity;\r\nthe weight of those bodies will not produce in them any motion.\r\nTherefore in any of these mechanical engines, if, when the bodies are\r\nput into motion, their velocities are reciprocally proportional to\r\ntheir respective weights, whereby the common center of gravity would\r\nremain at rest; the bodies will not receive any motion from their\r\nweight, that is, they will equiponderate. But this perhaps will be yet\r\nmore clearly conceived by the particular description of each mechanical\r\npower.\r\n\r\n32. THE lever was first named above. This is a bar made use of to\r\nsustain and move great weights. The bar is applied in one part to\r\nsome strong support; as the bar A B (in fig. 23, 24.) is applied at\r\nthe point C to the support D. In some other part of the bar, as E, is\r\napplied the weight to be sustained or moved; and in a third place, as\r\nF, is applied another weight or equivalent force, which is to sustain\r\nor move the weight at E. Now here, if, when the level should be put in\r\nmotion, and turned upon the point C, the velocity, wherewith the point\r\nF would move, bears the same proportion to the velocity, wherewith the\r\npoint E would move, as the weight at E bears to the weight or force at\r\nF; then the lever thus charged will have no propensity to move either\r\nway. If the weight or other force at F be not so great as to bear this\r\nproportion, the weight at E will not be sustained; but if the force at\r\nF be greater than this, the weight at E will be surmounted. This is\r\nevident from what has been said above[60], when the forces at E and F\r\nare placed (as in fig. 23.) on different sides of the support D. It\r\nwill appear also equally manifest in the other case, by continuing\r\nthe bar B C in fig. 24. on the other side of the support D, till C G\r\nbe equal to C F, and by hanging at G a weight equivalent to the power\r\nat F; for then, if the power at F were removed, the two weights at G\r\nand E would counterpoize each other, as in the former case: and it is\r\nevident, that the point F will be lifted up by the weight at G with the\r\nsame degree of force, as by the other power applied to F; since, if the\r\nweight at E were removed, a weight hung at F equal to that at G would\r\nbalance the lever, the distances C G and C F being equal.\r\n\r\n33. IF the two weights, or other powers, applied to the lever do\r\nnot counterbalance each other; a third power may be applied in any\r\nplace proposed of the lever, which shall hold the whole in a just\r\ncounterpoize. Suppose (in fig. 25.) the two powers at E and F did not\r\nequiponderate, and it were required to apply a third power to the point\r\nG, that might be sufficient to balance the lever. Find what power in\r\nF would just counterbalance the power in E; then if the difference\r\nbetween this power and that, which is actually applied at F, bear the\r\nsame proportion to the third power to be applied at G, as the distance\r\nC G bears to C F; the lever will be counterpoized by the help of this\r\nthird power, if it be so applied as to act the same way with the power\r\nin F, when that power is too small to counterbalance the power in E;\r\nbut otherwise the power in G must be so applied, as to act against the\r\npower in F. In like manner, if a lever were charged with three, or any\r\ngreater number of weights or other powers, which did not counterpoize\r\neach other, another power might be applied in any place proposed,\r\nwhich should bring the whole to a just balance. And what is here said\r\nconcerning a plurality of powers, may be equally applied to all the\r\nfollowing cases.\r\n\r\n34. IF the lever should consist of two arms making an angle at the\r\npoint C (as in fig. 26.) yet if the forces are applied perpendicularly\r\nto each arm, the same proportion will hold between the forces applied,\r\nand the distances of the center, whereon the lever rests, from the\r\npoints to which they are applied. That is, the weight at E will be to\r\nthe force in F in the same proportion, as C F bears to C E.\r\n\r\n35. BUT whenever the forces applied to the lever act obliquely to the\r\narm, to which they are applied (as in fig. 27.) then the strength of\r\nthe forces is to be estimated by lines let fall from the center of\r\nthe lever to the directions, wherein the forces act. To balance the\r\nlevers in fig. 27, the weight or other force at F will bear the same\r\nproportion to the weight at E, as the distance C E bears to C G the\r\nperpendicular let fall from the point C upon the line, which denotes\r\nthe direction wherein the force applied to F acts: for here, if the\r\nlever be put into motion, the power applied to F will begin to move in\r\nthe direction of the line F G; and therefore its first motion will be\r\nthe same, as the motion of the point G.\r\n\r\n36. WHEN two weights hang upon a lever, and the point, by which the\r\nlever is supported, is placed in the middle between the two weights,\r\nthat the arms of the lever are both of equal length; then this lever is\r\nparticularly called a balance; and equal weights equiponderate as in\r\ncommon scales. When the point of support is not equally distant from\r\nboth weights, it constitutes that instrument for weighing, which is\r\ncalled a steelyard. Though both in common scales, and the steelyard,\r\nthe point, on which the beam is hung, is not usually placed just in the\r\nsame straight line with the points, that hold the weights, but rather\r\na little above (as in fig. 28.) where the lines drawn from the point\r\nC, whereon the beam is suspended, to the points E and F, on which the\r\nweights are hung, do not make absolutely one continued line. If the\r\nthree points E, C, and F were in one straight line, those weights,\r\nwhich equiponderated, when the beam hung horizontally, would also\r\nequiponderate in any other situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut we see in these instruments, when they are charged with weights,\r\nwhich equiponderate with the beam hanging horizontally; that, if\r\nthe beam be inclined either way, the weight most elevated surmounts\r\nthe other, and descends, causing the beam to swing, till by degrees\r\nit recovers its horizontal position. This effect arises from the\r\nforementioned structure: for by this structure these instruments are\r\nlevers composed of two arms, which make an angle at the point of\r\nsupport (as in fig. 29, 30.) the first of which represents the case\r\nof the common balance, the second the case of the steelyard. In the\r\nfirst, where C E and C F are equal, equal weights hung at E and F will\r\nequiponderate, when the points E and F are in an horizontal situation.\r\nSuppose the lines E G and F H to be perpendicular to the horizon, then\r\nthey will denote the directions, wherein the forces applied to E and\r\nF act. Therefore the proportion between the weights at E and F, which\r\nshall equiponderate, are to be judged of by perpendiculars, as C I, C\r\nK, let fall from C upon E G and F H: so that the weights being equal,\r\nthe lines C I, C K, must be equal also, when the weights equiponderate.\r\nBut I believe my readers will easily see, that since C E and C F are\r\nequal, the lines C I and C K will be equal, when the points E and F are\r\nhorizontally situated.\r\n\r\n37. IF this lever be set into any other position (as in fig. 31.) then\r\nthe weight, which is raised highest, will outweigh the other. Here,\r\nif the point F be raised higher than E, the perpendicular C K will be\r\nlonger than C I: and therefore the weights would equiponderate, if\r\nthe weight at F were less than the weight at E. But the weight at\r\nF is equal to that at E; therefore is greater, than is necessary to\r\ncounterbalance the weight at E, and consequently will outweigh it, and\r\ndraw the beam of the lever down.\r\n\r\n38. IN like manner in the case of the steelyard (fig. 32.) if the\r\nweights at E and F are so proportioned, as to equiponderate, when the\r\npoints E and F are horizontally situated; then in any other situation\r\nof this lever the weight, which is raised highest, will preponderate.\r\nThat is, if in the horizontal situation of the points E and F the\r\nweight at F bears the same proportion to the weight at E, as C I bears\r\nto C K; then, if the point F be raised higher than E (as in fig. 32.)\r\nthe weight at F shall bear a greater proportion to the weight at E,\r\nthan C I bears to C K.\r\n\r\n39. FARTHER a lever may be hung upon an axis, and then the two arms\r\nof the lever need not be continuous, but fixed to different parts of\r\nthis axis; as in fig. 33, where the axis A B is supported by its two\r\nextremities A and B. To this axis one arm of the lever is fixed at the\r\npoint C, the other at the point D. Now here, if a weight be hung at E,\r\nthe extremity of that arm, which is fixed to the axis at the point C;\r\nand another weight be hung at F, the extremity of the arm, which is\r\nfixed on the axis at D; then these weights will equiponderate, when the\r\nweight at E bears the same proportion to the weight at F, as the arm D\r\nF bears to C E.\r\n\r\n40. THIS is the case, if both the arms are perpendicular to the axis,\r\nand lie (as the geometers express themselves) in the same plane; or, in\r\nother words, if the arms are so fixed perpendicularly upon the axis,\r\nthat, when one of them lies horizontally, the other shall also be\r\nhorizontal. If either arm stand not perpendicular to the axis; then, in\r\ndetermining the proportion between the weights, instead of the length\r\nof that arm, you must use the perpendicular let fall upon the axis from\r\nthe extremity of that arm. If the arms are not so fixed as to become\r\nhorizontal, at the same time; the method of assigning the proportion\r\nbetween the weights is analogous to that made use of above in levers,\r\nwhich make an angle at the point, whereon they are supported.\r\n\r\n41. FROM this case of the lever hung on an axis, it is easy to make a\r\ntransition to another mechanical power, the wheel and axis.\r\n\r\n42. THIS instrument is a wheel fixed on a roller, the roller being\r\nsupported at each extremity so as to turn round freely with the wheel,\r\nin the manner represented in fig. 34, where A B is the wheel, C D the\r\nroller, and E F its two supports. Now suppose a weight G hung by a cord\r\nwound round the roller, and another weight H hung by a cord wound about\r\nthe wheel the contrary way: that these weights may support each other,\r\nthe weight H must bear the same proportion to the weight G, as the\r\nthickness of the roller bears to the diameter of the wheel.\r\n\r\n43. SUPPOSE the line _k l_ to be drawn through the middle of the\r\nroller; and from the place of the roller, where the cord, on which the\r\nweight G hangs, begins to leave the roller, as at _m_, let the line_\r\nm n_ be drawn perpendicularly to _k l_; and from the point, where\r\nthe cord holding the weight H begins to leave the wheel, as at _o_,\r\nlet the line _o p_ be drawn perpendicular to _k l_. This being done,\r\nthe two lines _o p_ and _m n_ represent two arms of a lever fixed on\r\nthe axis _k l_; consequently the weight H will bear to the weight G\r\nthe same proportion, as _m n_ bears to _o p_. But _m n_ bears the\r\nsame proportion to _o p_, as the thickness of the roller bears to the\r\ndiameter of the wheel; for _m n_ is half the thickness of the roller,\r\nand _o p_ half the diameter of the wheel.\r\n\r\n44. IF the wheel be put into motion, and turned once round, that the\r\ncord, on which the weight G hangs, be wound once more round the axis;\r\nthen at the same time the cord, whereon the weight H hangs, will be\r\nwound off from the wheel one circuit. Therefore the velocity of the\r\nweight G will bear the same proportion to the velocity of the weight H,\r\nas the circumference of the roller to the circumference of the wheel.\r\nBut the circumference of the roller bears the same proportion to the\r\ncircumference of the wheel, as the thickness of the roller bears to\r\nthe diameter of the wheel, consequently the velocity of the weight\r\nG bears to the velocity of the weight H the same proportion, as the\r\nthickness of the roller bears to the diameter of the wheel, which is\r\nthe proportion that the weight H bears to the weight G. Therefore as\r\nbefore in the lever, so here also the general rule laid down above is\r\nverified, that the weights equiponderate, when their velocities would\r\nbe reciprocally proportional to their respective weights.\r\n\r\n45. IN like manner, if on the same axis two wheels of different sizes\r\nare fixed (as in fig. 35.) and a weight hung on each; the weights will\r\nequiponderate, if the weight hung on the greater wheel bear the same\r\nproportion to the weight hung on the lesser, as the diameter of the\r\nlesser wheel bears to the diameter of the greater.\r\n\r\n46. IT is usual to join many wheels together in the same frame, which\r\nby the means of certain teeth, formed in the circumference of each\r\nwheel, shall communicate motion to each other. A machine of this nature\r\nis represented in fig. 36. Here A B C is a winch, upon which is fixed\r\na small wheel D indented with teeth, which move in the like teeth of\r\na larger wheel E F fixed on the axis G H. Let this axis carry another\r\nwheel I, which shall move in like manner a greater wheel K L fixed on\r\nthe axis M N. Let this axis carry another small wheel O, which after\r\nthe same manner shall turn about a larger wheel P Q fixed on the roller\r\nR S, on which a cord shall be wound, that holds a weight, as T. Now\r\nthe proportion required between the weight T and a power applied to\r\nthe winch at A sufficient to support the weight, will most easily be\r\nestimated, by computing the proportion, which the velocity of the point\r\nA would bear to the velocity of the weight. If the winch be turned\r\nround, the point A will describe a circle as A V. Suppose the wheel E F\r\nto have ten times the number of teeth, as the wheel D; then the winch\r\nmust turn round ten times to carry the wheel E F once round. If wheel K\r\nL has also ten times the number of teeth, as I, the wheel I must turn\r\nround ten times to carry the wheel K L once round; and consequently\r\nthe winch A B C must turn round an hundred times to turn the wheel K L\r\nonce round. Lastly, if the wheel P Q has ten times the number of teeth,\r\nas the wheel O, the winch must turn about one thousand times in order\r\nto turn the wheel P Q, or the roller R S once round. Therefore here\r\nthe point A must have gone over the circle A V a thousand times, in\r\norder to lift the weight T through a space equal to the circumference\r\nof the roller R S: whence it follows, that the power applied at A will\r\nbalance the weight T, if it bear the same proportion to it, as the\r\ncircumference of the roller to one thousand times the circle A V; or\r\nthe same proportion as half the thickness of the roller bears to one\r\nthousand times A B.\r\n\r\n47. I SHALL now explain the effect of the pulley. Let a weight hang by\r\na pulley, as in fig. 37. Here it is evident, that the power A, by which\r\nthe weight B is supported, must be equal to the weight; for the cord C\r\nD is equally strained between them; and if the weight B move, the power\r\nA must move with equal velocity. The pulley E has no other effect, than\r\nto permit the power A to act in another direction, than it must have\r\ndone, if it had been directly applied to support the weight without the\r\nintervention of any such instrument.\r\n\r\n48. AGAIN, let a weight be supported, as in fig. 38; where the weight\r\nA is fixed to the pulley B, and the cord, by which the weight is\r\nupheld, is annexed by one extremity to a hook C, and at the other end\r\nis held by the power D. Here the weight is supported by a cord doubled;\r\ninsomuch that although the cord were not strong enough to hold the\r\nweight single, yet being thus doubled it might support it. If the\r\nend of the cord held by the power D were hung on the hook C, as well\r\nas the other end; then, when both ends of the cord were tied to the\r\nhook, it is evident, that the hook would bear the whole weight; and\r\neach end of the string would bear against the hook with the force of\r\nhalf the weight only, seeing both ends together bear with the force of\r\nthe whole. Hence it is evident, that, when the power D holds one end\r\nof the weight, the force, which it must exert to support the weight,\r\nmust be equal to just half the weight. And the same proportion between\r\nthe weight and power might be collected from comparing the respective\r\nvelocities, with which they would move; for it is evident, that the\r\npower must move through a space equal to twice the distance of the\r\npulley from the hook, in order to lift the pulley up to the hook.\r\n\r\n49. IT is equally easy to estimate the effect, when many pulleys are\r\ncombined together, as in fig. 39, 40; in the first of which the under\r\nset of pulleys, and consequently the weight is held by six strings; and\r\nin the latter figure by five: therefore in the first of these figures\r\nthe power to support the weight, must be one sixth part only of the\r\nweight, and in the latter figure the power must be one fifth part.\r\n\r\n50. THERE are two other ways of supporting a weight by pulleys, which I\r\nshall particularly consider.\r\n\r\n51. ONE of these ways is represented in fig. 41. Here the weight being\r\nconnected to the pulley B, a power equal to half the weight A would\r\nsupport the pulley C, if applied immediately to it. Therefore the\r\npulley C is drawn down with a force equal to half the weight A. But if\r\nthe pulley D were to be immediately supported by half the force, with\r\nwhich the pulley C is drawn down, this pulley D will uphold the pulley\r\nC; so that if the pulley D be upheld with a force equal to one fourth\r\npart of the weight A, that force will support the weight. But, for the\r\nsame reason as before, if the power in E be equal to half the force\r\nnecessary to uphold the pulley D; this pulley, and consequently the\r\nweight A, will be upheld: therefore, if the power in E be one eighth\r\npart of the weight A, it will support the weight.\r\n\r\n52. ANOTHER way of applying pulleys to a weight is represented in fig.\r\n42. To explain the effect of pulleys thus applied, it will be proper to\r\nconsider different weights hanging, as in fig. 43. Here, if the power\r\nand weights balance each other, the power A is equal to the weight B;\r\nthe weight C is equal to twice the power A, or the weight B; and for\r\nthe same reason the weight D is equal to twice the weight C, or equal\r\nto four times the power A. It is evident therefore, that all the three\r\nweights B, C, D together are equal to seven times the power A. But if\r\nthese three weights were joined in one, they would produce the case of\r\nfig. 40: so that in that figure the weight A, where there are three\r\npulleys, is seven times the power B. If there had been but two pulleys,\r\nthe weight would have been three times the power; and if there had been\r\nfour pulleys, the weight would have been fifteen times the power.\r\n\r\n53. THE wedge is next to be considered. The form of this instrument is\r\nsufficiently known. When it is put under any weight (as in fig. 44.)\r\nthe force, with which the wedge will lift the weight, when drove under\r\nit by a blow upon the end A B, will bear the same proportion to the\r\nforce, wherewith the blow would act on the weight, if directly applied\r\nto it; as the velocity, which the wedge receives from the blow, bears\r\nto the velocity, wherewith the weight is lifted by the wedge.\r\n\r\n54. THE screw is the fifth mechanical power. There are two ways of\r\napplying this instrument. Sometimes it is screwed into a hole, as\r\nin fig. 45, where the screw A B is screwed through the plank C D.\r\nSometimes the screw is applied to the teeth of a wheel, as in fig. 46,\r\nwhere the thread of the screw A B turns in the teeth of a wheel C D. In\r\nboth these cases, if a bar, as A E, be fixed to the end A of the screw;\r\nthe force, wherewith the end B of the screw in fig. 45 is forced down,\r\nand the force, wherewith the teeth of the wheel C D in fig. 44 are\r\nheld, bears the same proportion to the power applied to the end E of\r\nthe bar; as the velocity, wherewith the end E will move, when the screw\r\nis turned, bears to the velocity, wherewith the end B of the screw in\r\nfig. 43, or the teeth of the wheel C D in fig. 46, will be moved.\r\n\r\n55. THE inclined plane affords also a means of raising a weight with\r\nless force, than what is equal to the weight it self. Suppose it were\r\nrequired to raise the globe A (in fig. 47.) from the ground B C up\r\nto the point, whose perpendicular height from the ground is E D. If\r\nthis globe be drawn along the slant D F, less force will be required\r\nto raise it, than if it were lifted directly up. Here if the force\r\napplied to the globe bear the same proportion only to its weight, as\r\nE D bears to F D, it will be sufficient to hold up the globe; and\r\ntherefore any addition to that force will put it in motion, and draw\r\nit up; unless the globe, by pressing against the plane, whereon it\r\nlies, adhere in some degree to the plane. This indeed it must always\r\ndo more or less, since no plane can be made so absolutely smooth as\r\nto have no inequalities at all; nor yet so infinitely hard, as not to\r\nyield in the least to the pressure of the weight. Therefore the globe\r\ncannot be laid on such a plane, whereon it will slide with perfect\r\nfreedom, but they must in some measure rub against each other; and this\r\nfriction will make it necessary to imploy a certain degree of force\r\nmore, than what is necessary to support the globe, in order to give\r\nit any motion. But as all the mechanical powers are subject in some\r\ndegree or other to the like impediment from friction; I shall here\r\nonly shew what force would be necessary to sustain the globe, if it\r\ncould lie upon the plane without causing any friction at all. And I\r\nsay, that if the globe were drawn by the cord G H, lying parallel to\r\nthe plane D F; and the force, wherewith the cord is pulled, bear the\r\nsame proportion to the weight of the globe, as E D bears to D F; this\r\nforce will sustain the globe. In order to the making proof of this, let\r\nthe cord G H be continued on, and turned over the pulley I, and let\r\nthe weight K be hung to it. Now I say, if this weight bears the same\r\nproportion to the globe A, as D E bears to D F, the weight will support\r\nthe globe. I think it is very manifest, that the center of the globe A\r\nwill lie in one continued line with the cord H G. Let L be the center\r\nof the globe, and M the center of gravity of the weight K. In the first\r\nplace let the weight hang so, that a line drawn from L to M shall lie\r\nhorizontally; and I say, if the globe be moved either up or down the\r\nplane D F, the weight will so move along with it, that the center of\r\ngravity common to both the weights shall continue in this line L M, and\r\ntherefore shall in no case descend. To prove this more fully, I shall\r\ndepart a little from the method of this treatise, and make use of a\r\nmathematical proportion or two: but they are such, as any person, who\r\nhas read ~EUCLID’S ELEMENTS~, will fully comprehend; and are\r\nin themselves so evident, that, I believe, my readers, who are wholly\r\nstrangers to geometrical writings, will make no difficulty of admitting\r\nthem. This being premised, let the globe be moved up, till its center\r\nbe at G, then will M the center of gravity of the weight K be sunk to\r\nN; so that M N shall be equal to G L. Draw N G crossing the line M L\r\nin O; then I say, that O is the common center of gravity of the two\r\nweights in this their new situation. Let G P be drawn perpendicular to\r\nM L; then G L will bear the same proportion to G P, as D F bears to D\r\nE; and M N being equal to G L, M N will bear the same proportion to G\r\nP, as D F bears to D E. But N O bears the same proportion to O G, as\r\nM N bears to G P; consequently N O will bear the same proportion to\r\nO G, as D F bears to D E. In the last place, the weight of the globe\r\nA bears the same proportion to the other weight K, as D F bears to D\r\nE; therefore N O bears the same proportion to O G, as the weight of\r\nthe globe A bears to the weight K. Whence it follows, that, when the\r\ncenter of the globe A is in G, and the center of gravity of the weight\r\nK is in N, O will be the center of gravity common to both the weights.\r\nAfter the same manner, if the globe had been caused to descend, the\r\ncommon center of gravity would have been found in this line M L. Since\r\ntherefore no motion of the globe either way will make the common center\r\nof gravity descend, it is manifest, from what has been said above, that\r\nthe weights A and K counterpoize each other.\r\n\r\n56. I SHALL now consider the case of pendulums. A pendulum is made\r\nby hanging a weight to a line, so that it may swing backwards and\r\nforwards. This motion the geometers have very carefully considered,\r\nbecause it is the most commodious instrument of any for the exact\r\nmeasurement of time.\r\n\r\n57. I HAVE observed already[61], that if a body hanging perpendicularly\r\nby a string, as the body A (in fig. 48.) hangs by the string A B, be\r\nput so into motion, as to be made to ascend up the circular arch A C;\r\nthen as soon as it has arrived at the highest point, to which the\r\nmotion, that the body has received, will carry it; it will immediately\r\nbegin to descend, and at A will receive again as great a degree of\r\nmotion, as it had at first. This motion therefore will carry the\r\nbody up the arch A D, as high as it ascended before in the arch A C.\r\nConsequently in its return through the arch D A it will acquire again\r\nat A its original velocity, and advance a second time up the arch\r\nA C as high as at first; by this means continuing without end its\r\nreciprocal motion. It is true indeed, that in fact every pendulum,\r\nwhich we can put in motion, will gradually lessen its swing, and\r\nat length stop, unless there be some power constantly applied to\r\nit, whereby its motion shall be renewed; but this arises from the\r\nresistance, which the body meets with both from the air, and the string\r\nby which it is hung: for as the air will give some obstruction to the\r\nprogress of the body moving through it; so also the string, whereon the\r\nbody hangs, will be a farther impediment; for this string must either\r\nslide on the pin, whereon it hangs, or it must bend to the motion of\r\nthe weight; in the first there must be some degree of friction, and\r\nin the latter the string will make some resistance to its inflection.\r\nHowever, if all resistance could be removed, the motion of a pendulum\r\nwould be perpetual.\r\n\r\n58. BUT to proceed, the first property, I shall take notice of in this\r\nmotion, is, that the greater arch the pendulous body moves through, the\r\ngreater time it takes up: though the length of time does not increase\r\nin so great a proportion as the arch. Thus if C D be a greater arch,\r\nand E F a lesser, where C A is equal to A D, and E A equal to A F;\r\nthe body, when it swings through the greater arch C D, shall take up\r\nin its swing from C to D a longer time than in swinging from E to F,\r\nwhen it moves only in that lesser arch; or the time in which the body\r\nlet fall from C will descend through the arch C A is greater than the\r\ntime, in which it will descend through the arch E A, when let fall from\r\nE. But the first of these times will not hold the same proportion to\r\nthe latter, as the first arch C A bears to the other arch E A; which\r\nwill appear thus. Let C G and E H be two horizontal lines. It has been\r\nremarked above[62], that the body in falling through the arch C A will\r\nacquire as great a velocity at the point A, as it would have gained by\r\nfalling directly down through G A; and in falling through the arch E A\r\nit will acquire in the point A only that velocity, which it would have\r\ngot in falling through H A. Therefore, when the body descends through\r\nthe greater arch C A, it shall gain a greater velocity, than when it\r\npasses only through the lesser; so that this greater velocity will in\r\nsome degree compensate the greater length of the arch.\r\n\r\n59. THE increase of velocity, which the body acquires in falling from\r\na greater height, has such an effect, that, if straight lines be drawn\r\nfrom A to C and E, the body would fall through the longer straight\r\nline C A just in the same time, as through the shorter straight line\r\nE A. This is demonstrated by the geometers, who prove, that if any\r\ncircle, as A B C D (fig. 49.) be placed in a perpendicular situation;\r\na body shall fall obliquely through every line, as A B drawn from the\r\nlowest point A in the circle to any other point in the circumference\r\njust in the same time, as would be imployed by the body in falling\r\nperpendicularly down through the diameter C A. But the time in which\r\nthe body will descend through the arch, is different from the time,\r\nwhich it would take up in falling through the line A B.\r\n\r\n60. IT has been thought by some, that because in very small arches this\r\ncorrespondent straight line differs but little from the arch itself;\r\ntherefore the descent through this straight line would be performed\r\nin such small arches nearly in the same time as through the arches\r\nthemselves: so that if a pendulum were to swing in small arches,\r\nhalf the time of a single swing would be nearly equal to the time,\r\nin which a body would fall perpendicularly through twice the length\r\nof the pendulum. That is, the whole time of the swing, according to\r\nthis opinion, will be four fold the time required for the body to fall\r\nthrough half the length of the pendulum; because the time of the body’s\r\nfalling down twice the length of the pendulum is half the time required\r\nfor the fall through one quarter of this space, that is through half\r\nthe pendulum’s length. However there is here a mistake; for the whole\r\ntime of the swing, when the pendulum moves through small arches, bears\r\nto the time required for a body to fall down through half the length of\r\nthe pendulum very nearly the same proportion, as the circumference of a\r\ncircle bears to its diameter; that is very nearly the proportion of 355\r\nto 113, or little more than the proportion of 3 to 1. If the pendulum\r\ntakes so great a swing, as to pass over an arch equal to one sixth part\r\nof the whole circumference of the circle, it will swing 115 times,\r\nwhile it ought according to this proportion to have swung 117 times; so\r\nthat, when it swings in so large an arch, it loses something less than\r\ntwo swings in an hundred. If it swing through 1/10 only of the circle,\r\nit shall not lose above one vibration in 160. If it swing in 1/20 of\r\nthe circle, it shall lose about one vibration in 690. If its swing be\r\nconfined to 1/40 of the whole circle, it shall lose very little more\r\nthan one swing in 2600. And if it take no greater a swing than through\r\n1/60 of the whole circle, it shall not lose one swing in 5800.\r\n\r\n61. NOW it follows from hence, that, when pendulums swing in small\r\narches, there is very nearly a constant proportion observed between\r\nthe time of their swing, and the time, in which a body would fall\r\nperpendicularly down through half their length. And we have declared\r\nabove, that the spaces, through which bodies fall, are in a two fold\r\nproportion of the times, which they take up in falling[63]. Therefore\r\nin pendulums of different lengths, swinging through small arches, the\r\nlengths of the pendulums are in a two fold or duplicate proportion of\r\nthe times, they take in swinging; so that a pendulum of four times the\r\nlength of another shall take up twice the time in each swing, one of\r\nnine times the length will make one swing only for three swings of the\r\nshorter, and so on.\r\n\r\n62. THIS proportion in the swings of different pendulums not only holds\r\nin small arches; but in large ones also, provided they be such, as the\r\ngeometers call similar; that is, if the arches bear the same proportion\r\nto the whole circumferences of their respective circles. Suppose (in\r\nfig. 48.) A B, C D to be two pendulums. Let the arch E F be described\r\nby the motion of the pendulum A B, and the arch G H be described by\r\nthe pendulum C D; and let the arch E F bear the same proportion to the\r\nwhole circumference, which would be formed by turning the pendulum A\r\nB quite round about the point A, as the arch G H bears to the whole\r\ncircumference, that would be formed by turning the pendulum C D quite\r\nround the point C. Then I say, the proportion, which the length of the\r\npendulum A B bears to the length of the pendulum C D, will be two fold\r\nof the proportion, which the time taken up in the description of the\r\narch E F bears to the time employed in the description of the arch G H.\r\n\r\n63. THUS pendulums, which swing in very small arches, are nearly an\r\nequal measure of time. But as they are not such an equal measure to\r\ngeometrical exactness; the mathematicians have found out a method of\r\ncausing a pendulum so to swing, that, if its motion were not obstructed\r\nby any resistance, it would always perform each swing in the same time,\r\nwhether it moved through a greater, or a lesser space. This was first\r\ndiscovered by the great ~HUYGENS~, and is as follows. Upon the\r\nstraight line A B (in fig. 49.) let the circle C D E be so placed, as\r\nto touch the straight line in the point C. Then let this circle roll\r\nalong upon the straight line A B, as a coach-wheel rolls along upon\r\nthe ground. It is evident, that, as soon as ever the circle begins to\r\nmove, the point C in the circle will be lifted off from the straight\r\nline A B; and in the motion of the circle will describe a crooked\r\ncourse, which is represented by the line C F G H. Here the part C H of\r\nthe straight line included between the two extremities C and H of the\r\nline C F G H will be equal to the whole circumference of the circle C D\r\nE; and if C H be divided into two equal parts at the point I, and the\r\nstraight line I K be drawn perpendicular to C H, this line I K will\r\nbe equal to the diameter of the circle C D E. Now in this line if a\r\nbody were to be let fall from the point H, and were to be carried by\r\nits weight down the line H G K, as far as the point K, which is the\r\nlowest point of the line C F G H; and if from any other point G a body\r\nwere to be let fall in the same manner; this body, which falls from\r\nG, will take just the same time in coming to K, as the body takes up,\r\nwhich falls from H. Therefore if a pendulum can be so hung, that the\r\nball shall move in the line A G F E, all its swings, whether long or\r\nshort, will be performed in the same time; for the time, in which the\r\nball will descend to the point K, is always half the time of the whole\r\nswing. But the ball of a pendulum will be made to swing in this line by\r\nthe following means. Let K I (in fig. 52.) be prolonged upwards to L,\r\ntill I L is equal to I K. Then let the line L M H equal and like to K\r\nH be applied, as in the figure between the points L and H, so that the\r\npoint which in this line L M H answers to the point H in the line K H\r\nshall be applied to the point L, and the point answering to the point\r\nK shall be applied to the point H. Also let such another line L N C be\r\napplied between L and C in the same manner. This preparation being\r\nmade; if a pendulum be hung at the point L of such a length, that the\r\nball thereof shall reach to K; and if the string shall continually bend\r\nagainst the lines H M L and L N C, as the pendulum swings to and fro;\r\nby this means the ball shall constantly keep in the line C K H.\r\n\r\n64. NOW in this pendulum, as all the swings, whether long or short,\r\nwill be performed in the same time; so the time of each will exactly\r\nbear the same proportion to the time required for a body to fall\r\nperpendicularly down, through half the length of the pendulum, that is\r\nfrom I to K, as the circumference of a circle bears to its diameter.\r\n\r\n65. IT may from hence be understood in some measure, why, when\r\npendulums swing in circular arches, the times of their swings are\r\nnearly equal, if the arches are small, though those arches be of very\r\nunequal lengths; for if with the semidiameter L K the circular arch O\r\nK P be described, this arch in the lower part of it will differ very\r\nlittle from the line C K H.\r\n\r\n66. IT may not be amiss here to remark, that a body will fall in this\r\nline C K H (fig. 53.) from C to any other point, as Q or R in a shorter\r\nspace of time, than if it moved through the straight line drawn from\r\nC to the other point; or through any other line whatever, that can be\r\ndrawn between these two points.\r\n\r\n67. BUT as I have observed, that the time, which a pendulum takes in\r\nswinging, depends upon its length; I shall now say something concerning\r\nthe way, in which this length of the pendulum is to be estimated. If\r\nthe whole ball of the pendulum could be crouded into one point, this\r\nlength, by which the motion of the pendulum is to be computed, would\r\nbe the length of the string or rod. But the ball of the pendulum must\r\nhave a sensible magnitude, and the several parts of this ball will not\r\nmove with the same degree of swiftness; for those parts, which are\r\nfarthest from the point, whereon the pendulum is suspended, must move\r\nwith the greatest velocity. Therefore to know the time in which the\r\npendulum swings, it is necessary to find that point of the ball, which\r\nmoves with the same degree of velocity, as if the whole ball were to be\r\ncontracted into that point.\r\n\r\n68. THIS point is not the center of gravity, as I shall now endeavour\r\nto shew. Suppose the pendulum A B (in fig. 54.) composed of an\r\ninflexible rod A C and ball C B, to be fixed on the point A, and lifted\r\nup into an horizontal situation. Here if the rod were not fixed to the\r\npoint A, the body C B would descend directly with the whole force of\r\nits weight; and each part of the body would move down with the same\r\ndegree of swiftness. But when the rod is fixed at the point A, the\r\nbody must fall after another manner; for the parts of the body must\r\nmove with different degrees of velocity, the parts more remote from A\r\ndescending with a swifter motion, than the parts nearer to A; so that\r\nthe body will receive a kind of rolling motion while it descends. But\r\nit has been observed above, that the effect of gravity upon any body\r\nis the same, as if the whole force were exerted on the body’s center of\r\ngravity[64].\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSince therefore the power of gravity in drawing down the body must also\r\ncommunicate to it the rolling motion just described; it seems evident,\r\nthat the center of gravity of the body cannot be drawn down as swiftly,\r\nas when the power of gravity has no other effect to produce on the\r\nbody, than merely to draw it downward. If therefore the whole matter of\r\nthe body C B could be crouded into its center of gravity, so that being\r\nunited into one point, this rolling motion here mentioned might give\r\nno hindrance to its descent; this center would descend faster, than it\r\ncan now do. And the point, which now descends as fast, as if the whole\r\nmatter or the body C B were crouded into it, will be farther removed\r\nfrom the point A, than the center of gravity of the body C B.\r\n\r\n69. AGAIN, suppose the pendulum A B (in fig. 55.) to hang obliquely.\r\nHere the power of gravity will operate less upon the ball of the\r\npendulum, than before: but the line D E being drawn so, as to stand\r\nperpendicular to the rod A C of the pendulum; the force of gravity\r\nupon the body C B, now it is in this situation, will produce the same\r\neffect, as if the body were to glide down an inclined plane in the\r\nposition of D E. But here the motion of the body, when the rod is fixed\r\nto the point A, will not be equal to the uninterrupted descent of the\r\nbody down this plane; for the body will here also receive the same\r\nkind of rotation in its motion, as before; so that the motion of the\r\ncenter of gravity will in like manner be retarded; and the point, which\r\nhere descends with that degree of swiftness, which the body would have,\r\nif not hindered by being fixed to the point A; that is, the point,\r\nwhich descends as fast, as if the whole body were crouded into it, will\r\nbe as far removed from the point A, as before.\r\n\r\n70. THIS point, by which the length of the pendulum is to be estimated,\r\nis called the center of oscillation. And the mathematicians have laid\r\ndown general directions, whereby to find this center in all bodies. If\r\nthe globe A B (in fig. 56.) be hung by the string C D, whose weight\r\nneed not be regarded, the center of oscillation is found thus. Let the\r\nstraight line drawn from C to D be continued through the globe to F.\r\nThat it will pass through the center of the globe is evident. Suppose E\r\nto be this center of the globe; and take the line G of such a length,\r\nthat it shall bear the same proportion to E D, as E D bears to E C.\r\nThen E H being made equal to ⅖ of G, the point H shall be the center of\r\noscillation[65]. If the weight of the rod C D is too considerable to\r\nbe neglected, divide C D (fig. 57) in I, that D I be equal to ⅓, part\r\nof C D; and take K in the same proportion to C I, as the weight of the\r\nglobe A B to the weight of the rod C D. Then having found H, the center\r\nof oscillation of the globe, as before, divide I K in I, so that I L\r\nshall bear the same proportion to L H, as the line C H bears to K; and\r\nL shall be the center of oscillation of the whole pendulum.\r\n\r\n71. THIS computation is made upon supposition, that the center of\r\noscillation of the rod C D, if that were to swing alone without any\r\nother weight annexed, would be the point I. And this point would be\r\nthe true center of oscillation, so far as the thickness of the rod is\r\nnot to be regarded. If any one chuses to take into consideration the\r\nthickness of the rod, he must place the center of oscillation thereof\r\nso much below the point I, that eight times the distance of the center\r\nfrom the point I shall bear the same proportion to the thickness of the\r\nrod, as the thickness of the rod bears to its length C D[66].\r\n\r\n72. IT has been observed above, that when a pendulum swings in an\r\narch of a circle, as here in fig. 58, the pendulum A B swings in the\r\ncircular arch C D; if you draw an horizontal line, as E F, from the\r\nplace whence the pendulum is let fall, to the line A G, which is\r\nperpendicular to the horizon: then the velocity, which the pendulum\r\nwill acquire in coming to the point G, will be the same, as any body\r\nwould acquire in falling directly down from F to G. Now this is to be\r\nunderstood of the circular arch, which is described by the center of\r\noscillation of the pendulum. I shall here farther observe, that if the\r\nstraight line E G be drawn from the point, whence the pendulum falls,\r\nto the lowest point of the arch; in the same or in equal pendulums the\r\nvelocity, which the pendulum acquires in G, is proportional to this\r\nline: that is, if the pendulum, after it has descended from E to G, be\r\ntaken back to H, and let fall from thence, and the line H G be drawn;\r\nthe velocity, which the pendulum shall acquire in G by its descent from\r\nH, shall bear the same proportion to the velocity, which it acquires\r\nin falling from E to G, as the straight line H G bears to the straight\r\nline E G.\r\n\r\n73. WE may now proceed to those experiments upon the percussion of\r\nbodies, which I observed above might be made with pendulums. This\r\nexpedient for examining the effects of percussion was first proposed\r\nby our late great architect Sir ~CHRISTOPHER WREN~. And it\r\nis as follows. Two balls, as A and B (in fig. 59.) either equal or\r\nunequal, are hung by two strings from two points C and D, so that, when\r\nthe balls hang down without motion, they shall just touch each other,\r\nand the strings be parallel. Here if one of these balls be removed to\r\nany distance from its perpendicular situation, and then let fall to\r\ndescend and strike against the other; by the last preceding paragraph\r\nit will be known, with what velocity this ball shall return into its\r\nfirst perpendicular situation, and consequently with what force it\r\nshall strike against the other ball; and by the height to which this\r\nother ball ascends after the stroke, the velocity communicated to this\r\nball will be discovered. For instance, let the ball A be taken up to\r\nE, and from thence be let fall to strike against B, passing over in\r\nits descent the circular arch E F. By this impulse let B fly up to G,\r\nmoving through the circular arch H G. Then E I and G K being drawn\r\nhorizontally, the ball A will strike against B with the velocity,\r\nwhich it would acquire in falling directly down from I; and the ball\r\nB has received a velocity, wherewith, if it had been thrown directly\r\nupward, it would have ascended up to K. Likewise if straight lines be\r\ndrawn from E to F and from H to G, the velocity of A, wherewith it\r\nstrikes, will bear the same proportion to the velocity, which B has\r\nreceived by the blow, as the straight line E F bears to the straight\r\nline H G. In the same manner by noting the place to which A ascends\r\nafter the stroke, its remaining velocity may be compared with that,\r\nwherewith it struck against B. Thus may be experimented the effects of\r\nthe body A striking against B at rest. If both the bodies are lifted\r\nup, and so let fall as to meet and impinge against each other just upon\r\nthe coming of both into their perpendicular situation; by observing\r\nthe places into which they move after the stroke, the effects of their\r\npercussion in all these cases may be found in the same manner as before.\r\n\r\n74. SIR ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has described these experiments;\r\nand has shewn how to improve them to a greater exactness by making\r\nallowance for the resistance, which the air gives to the motion of the\r\nballs[67]. But as this resistance is exceeding small, and the manner\r\nof allowing for it is delivered by himself in very plain terms, I need\r\nnot enlarge upon it here. I shall rather speak to a discovery, which\r\nhe made by these experiments upon the elasticity of bodies. It has\r\nbeen explained above[68], that when two bodies strike, if they be not\r\nelastic, they remain contiguous after the stroke; but that if they\r\nare elastic, they separate, and that the degree of their elasticity\r\ndetermines the proportion between the celerity wherewith they separate,\r\nand the celerity wherewith they meet. Now our author found, that the\r\ndegree of elasticity appeared in the same bodies always the same, with\r\nwhatever degree of force they struck; that is, the celerity wherewith\r\nthey separated, always bore the same proportion to the celerity\r\nwherewith they met: so that the elastic power in all the bodies, he\r\nmade trial upon, exerted it self in one constant proportion to the\r\ncompressing force. Our author made trial with balls of wool bound up\r\nvery compact, and found the celerity with which they receded, to bear\r\nabout the proportion of 5 to 9 to the celerity wherewith they met; and\r\nin steel he found nearly the same proportion; in cork the elasticity\r\nwas something less; but in glass much greater; for the celerity,\r\nwherewith balls of that material separated after percussion, he found\r\nto bear the proportion of 15 to 16 to the celerity wherewith they\r\nmet[69].\r\n\r\n75. I SHALL finish my discourse on pendulums, with this farther\r\nobservation only, that the center of oscillation is also the center\r\nof another force. If a body be fixed to any point, and being put in\r\nmotion turns round it; the body, if uninterrupted by the power of\r\ngravity or any other means, will continue perpetually to move about\r\nwith the same equable motion. Now the force, with which such a body\r\nmoves, is all united in the point, which in relation to the power of\r\ngravity is called the center of oscillation. Let the cylinder A B C D\r\n(in fig. 60.) whose axis is E F, be fixed to the point E. And supposing\r\nthe point E to be that on which the cylinder is suspended, let the\r\ncenter of oscillation be found in the axis E F, as has been explained\r\nabove[70]. Let G be that center: then I say, that the force, wherewith\r\nthis cylinder turns round the point E, is so united in the point G,\r\nthat a sufficient force applied in that point shall stop the motion of\r\nthe cylinder, in such a manner, that the cylinder should immediately\r\nremain without motion, though it were to be loosened from the point E\r\nat the same instant, that the impediment was applied to G: whereas, if\r\nthis impediment had been applied to any other point of the axis, the\r\ncylinder would turn upon the point, where the impediment was applied.\r\nIf the impediment had been applied between E and G, the cylinder would\r\nso turn on the point, where the impediment was applied, that the end\r\nB C would continue to move on the same way it moved before along with\r\nthe whole cylinder; but if the impediment were applied to the axis\r\nfarther off from E than G, the end A D of the cylinder would start out\r\nof its present place that way in which the cylinder moved. From this\r\nproperty of the center of oscillation, it is also called the center of\r\npercussion. That excellent mathematician, Dr. BROOK TAYLOR, has farther\r\nimproved this doctrine concerning the center of percussion, by shewing,\r\nthat if through this point G a line, as G H I, be drawn perpendicular\r\nto E F, and lying in the course of the body’s motion; a sufficient\r\npower applied to any point of this line will have the same effect, as\r\nthe like power applied to G[71]: so that as we before shewed the center\r\nof percussion within the body on its axis; by this means we may find\r\nthis center on the surface of the body also, for it will be where this\r\nline H I crosses that surface.\r\n\r\n76. I SHALL now proceed to the last kind of motion, to be treated on\r\nin this place, and shew what line the power of gravity will cause a\r\nbody to describe, when it is thrown forwards by any force. This was\r\nfirst discovered by the great ~GALILEO~, and is the principle,\r\nupon which engineers should direct the shot of great guns. But as in\r\nthis case bodies describe in their motion one of those lines, which in\r\ngeometry are called conic sections; it is necessary here to premise a\r\ndescription of those lines. In which I shall be the more particular,\r\nbecause the knowledge of them is not only necessary for the present\r\npurpose, but will be also required hereafter in some of the principal\r\nparts of this treatise.\r\n\r\n77. THE first lines considered by the ancient geometers were the\r\nstraight line and the circle. Of these they composed various figures,\r\nof which they demonstrated many properties, and resolved divers\r\nproblems concerning them. These problems they attempted always to\r\nresolve by the describing straight lines and circles. For instance, let\r\na square A B C D (fig. 61.) be proposed, and let it be required to make\r\nanother square in any assigned proportion to this. Prolong one side,\r\nas D A, of this square to E, till A E bear the same proportion to A D,\r\nas the new square is to bear to the square A C. If the opposite side B\r\nC of the square A C be also prolonged to F, till B F be equal to A E,\r\nand E F be afterwards drawn, I suppose my readers will easily conceive,\r\nthat the figure A B F E will bear to the square A B C D the same\r\nproportion, as the line A E bears to the line A D. Therefore the figure\r\nA B F E will be equal to the new square, which is to be found, but is\r\nnot it self a square, because the side A E is not of the same length\r\nwith the side E F. But to find a square equal to the figure A B F E\r\nyou must proceed thus. Divide the line D E into two equal parts in the\r\npoint G, and to the center G with the interval G D describe the circle\r\nD H E I; then prolong the line A B, till it meets the circle in K; and\r\nmake the square A K L M, which square will be equal to the figure A B F\r\nE, and bear to the square A B C D the same proportion, as the line A E\r\nbears to A D.\r\n\r\n78. I SHALL not proceed to the proof of this, having only here set it\r\ndown as a specimen of the method of resolving geometrical problems\r\nby the description of straight lines and circles. But there are some\r\nproblems, which cannot be resolved by drawing straight lines or circles\r\nupon a plane. For the management therefore of these they took into\r\nconsideration solid figures, and of the solid figures they found that,\r\nwhich is called a cone, to be the most useful.\r\n\r\n79. A CONE is thus defined by EUCLIDE in his elements of geometry[72].\r\nIf to the straight line A B (in fig. 62.) another straight line, as A\r\nC, be drawn perpendicular, and the two extremities B and C be joined by\r\na third straight line composing the triangle A C B (for so every figure\r\nis called, which is included under three straight lines) then the two\r\npoints A and B being held fixed, as two centers, and the triangle A C B\r\nbeing turned round upon the line A B, as on an axis; the line A C will\r\ndescribe a circle, and the figure A C B will describe a cone, of the\r\nform represented by the figure B C D E F (fig. 63.) in which the circle\r\nC D E F is usually called the base of the cone, and B the vertex.\r\n\r\n80. NOW by this figure may several problems be resolved, which cannot\r\nby the simple description of straight lines and circles upon a plane.\r\nSuppose for instance, it were required to make a cube, which should\r\nbear any assigned proportion to some other cube named. I need not here\r\ninform my readers, that a cube is the figure of a dye. This problem\r\nwas much celebrated among the ancients, and was once inforced by the\r\ncommand of an oracle. This problem may be performed by a cone thus.\r\nFirst make a cone from a triangle, whose side A C shall be half the\r\nlength of the side B C Then on the plane A B C D (fig. 64.) let the\r\nline E F be exhibited equal in length to the side of the cube proposed;\r\nand let the line F G be drawn perpendicular to E F, and of such a\r\nlength, that it bear the same proportion to E F, as the cube to be\r\nsought is required to bear to the cube proposed. Through the points E,\r\nF, and G let the circle F H I be described. Then let the line E F be\r\nprolonged beyond F to K, that F K be equal to F E, and let the triangle\r\nF K L, having all its sides F K, K L, L F equal to each other, be hung\r\ndown perpendicularly from the plane A B C D. After this, let another\r\nplane M N O P be extended through the point L, so as to be equidistant\r\nfrom the former plane A B C D, and in this plane let the line Q L R\r\nbe drawn so, as to be equidistant from the line E F K. All this being\r\nthus prepared, let such a cone, as was above directed to be made, be so\r\napplied to the plane M N O P, that it touch this plane upon the line\r\nQ R, and that the vertex of the cone be applied to the point L. This\r\ncone, by cutting through the first plane A B C D, will cross the circle\r\nF H I before described. And if from the point S, where the surface of\r\nthis cone intersects the circle, the line S T be drawn so, as to be\r\nequidistant from the line E F; the line F T will be equal to the side\r\nof the cube sought: that is, if there be two cubes or dyes formed, the\r\nside of one being equal to E F, and the side of the other equal to F T;\r\nthe former of these cubes shall bear the same proportion to the latter,\r\nas the line E F bears to F G.\r\n\r\n81. INDEED this placing a cone to cut through a plane is not a\r\npracticable method of resolving problems. But when the geometers had\r\ndiscovered this use of the cone, they applied themselves to consider\r\nthe nature of the lines, which will be produced by the intersection\r\nof the surface of a cone and a plane; whereby they might be enabled\r\nboth to reduce these kinds of solutions to practice, and also to render\r\ntheir demonstrations concise and elegant.\r\n\r\n82. WHENEVER the plane, which cuts the cone, is equidistant from\r\nanother plane, that touches the cone on the side; (which is the case of\r\nthe present figure;) the line, wherein the plane cuts the surface of\r\nthe cone, is called a parabola. But if the plane, which cuts the cone,\r\nbe so inclined to this other, that it will pass quite through the cone\r\n(as in fig. 65.) such a plane by cutting the cone produces the figure\r\ncalled an ellipsis, in which we shall hereafter shew the earth and\r\nother planets to move round the sun. If the plane, which cuts the cone,\r\nrecline the other way (as in fig. 66.) so as not to be parallel to any\r\nplane, whereon the cone can lie, nor yet to cut quite through the cone;\r\nsuch a plane shall produce in the cone a third kind of line, which\r\nis called an hyperbola. But it is the first of these lines named the\r\nparabola, wherein bodies, that are thrown obliquely, will be carried\r\nby the force of gravity; as I shall here proceed to shew, after having\r\nfirst directed my readers how to describe this sort of line upon a\r\nplane, by which the form of it may be seen.\r\n\r\n83. TO any straight line A B (fig. 67.) let a straight ruler C D be\r\nso applied, as to stand against it perpendicularly. Upon the edge of\r\nthis ruler let another ruler E F be so placed, as to move along upon\r\nthe edge of the first ruler C D, and keep always perpendicular to it.\r\nThis being so disposed, let any point, as G, be taken in the line A B,\r\nand let a string equal in length to the ruler E F be fastened by one\r\nend to the point G, and by the other to the extremity F of the ruler E\r\nF. Then if the string be held down to the ruler E F by a pin H, as is\r\nrepresented in the figure; the point of this pin, while the ruler E F\r\nmoves on the ruler C D, shall describe the line I K L, which will be\r\none part of the curve line, whose description we were here to teach:\r\nand by applying the rulers in the like manner on the other side of\r\nthe line A B, we may describe the other part I M of this line. If the\r\ndistance C G be equal to half the line E F in fig. 64, the line M I L\r\nwill be that very line, wherein the plane A B C D in that figure cuts\r\nthe cone.\r\n\r\n84. THE line A I is called the axis of the parabola M I L, and the\r\npoint G is called the focus.\r\n\r\n85. NOW by comparing the effects of gravity upon falling bodies, with\r\nwhat is demonstrated of this figure by the geometers, it is proved,\r\nthat every body thrown obliquely is carried forward in one of these\r\nlines, the axis whereof is perpendicular to the horizon.\r\n\r\n86. THE geometers demonstrate, that if a line be drawn to touch a\r\nparabola in any point, as the line A B (in fig. 68.) touches the\r\nparabola C D, whose axis is Y Z, in the point E; and several lines F\r\nG, H I, K L be drawn parallel to the axis of the parabola: then the\r\nline F G will be to H I in the duplicate proportion of E F to E H,\r\nand F G to K L in the duplicate proportion of E F to E K; likewise\r\nH I to K L in the duplicate proportion of E H to E K. What is to be\r\nunderstood by duplicate or two-fold proportion, has been already\r\nexplained[73]. Accordingly I mean here, that if the line M be taken to\r\nbear the same proportion to E H, as E H bears to E F, H I will bear\r\nthe same proportion to F G, as M bears to E F; and if the line N bears\r\nthe same proportion to E K, as E K bears to E F, K L will bear the\r\nsame proportion to F G, as N bears to E F; or if the line O bear the\r\nsame proportion to E K, as E K bears to E H, K L will bear the same\r\nproportion to H I, as O bears to E H.\r\n\r\n87. THIS property is essential to the parabola, being so connected with\r\nthe nature of the figure, that every line possessing this property is\r\nto be called by this name.\r\n\r\n88. NOW suppose a body to be thrown from the point A (in fig. 69.)\r\ntowards B in the direction of the line A B. This body, if left to\r\nit self, would move on with a uniform motion through this line A B.\r\nSuppose the eye of a spectator to be placed at the point C just under\r\nthe point A; and let us imagine the earth to be so put into motion\r\nalong with the body, as to carry the spectator’s eye along the line C D\r\nparallel to A B; and that the eye would move on with the same velocity,\r\nwherewith the body would proceed in the line A B, if it were to be\r\nleft to move without any disturbance from its gravitation towards the\r\nearth. In this case if the body moved on without being drawn towards\r\nthe earth, it would appear to the spectator to be at rest. But if the\r\npower of gravity exerted it self on the body, it would appear to the\r\nspectator to fall directly down. Suppose at the distance of time,\r\nwherein the body by its own progressive motion would have moved from A\r\nto E, it should appear to the spectator to have fallen through a length\r\nequal to E F: then the body at the end of this time will actually have\r\narrived at the point F. If in the space of time, wherein the body\r\nwould have moved by its progressive motion from A to G, it would have\r\nappeared to the spectator to have fallen down the space G H: then the\r\nbody at the end of this greater interval of time will be arrived at\r\nthe point H. Now if the line A F H I be that, through which the body\r\nactually passes; from what has here been said, it will follow, that\r\nthis line is one of those, which I have been describing under the name\r\nof the parabola. For the distances E F, G H, through which the body\r\nis seen to fall, will increase in the duplicate proportion of the\r\ntimes[74]; but the lines A E, A G will be proportional to the times\r\nwherein they would have been described by the single progressive motion\r\nof the body: therefore the lines E F, G H will be in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the lines A F, A G; and the line A F H I possesses the\r\nproperty of the parabola.\r\n\r\n89. IF the earth be not supposed to move along with the body, the\r\ncase will be a little different. For the body being constantly drawn\r\ndirectly towards the center of the earth, the body in its motion will\r\nbe drawn in a direction a little oblique to that, wherein it would be\r\ndrawn by the earth in motion, as before supposed. But the distance to\r\nthe center of the earth bears so vast a proportion to the greatest\r\nlength, to which we can throw bodies, that this obliquity does not\r\nmerit any regard. From the sequel of this discourse it may indeed\r\nbe collected, what line the body being thrown thus would be found\r\nto describe, allowance being made for this obliquity of the earth’s\r\naction[75]. This is the discovery of Sir IS. NEWTON; but has no use in\r\nthis place. Here it is abundantly sufficient to consider the body as\r\nmoving in a parabola.\r\n\r\n90. THE line, which a projected body describes, being thus known,\r\npractical methods have been deduced from hence for directing the\r\nshot of great guns to strike any object desired. This work was first\r\nattempted by ~GALILEO~, and soon after farther improved by\r\nhis scholar ~TORRICELLI~; but has lately been rendred more\r\ncomplete by the great Mr. ~COTES~, whose immature death is an\r\nunspeakable loss to mathematical learning. If it be required to throw\r\na body from the point A (in fig. 70.) so as to strike the point B;\r\nthrough the points A, B draw the straight line C D, and erect the line\r\nA E perpendicular to the horizon, and of four times the height, from\r\nwhich a body must fall to acquire the velocity, wherewith the body is\r\nintended to be thrown. Through the points A and E describe a circle,\r\nthat shall touch the line C D in the point A. Then from the point\r\nB draw the line B F perpendicular to the horizon, intersecting the\r\ncircle in the points G and H. This being done, if the body be projected\r\ndirectly towards either of these points G or H, it shall fall upon\r\nthe point B; but with this difference, that, if it be thrown in the\r\ndirection A G, it shall sooner arrive at B, than if it were projected\r\nin the direction A H. When the body is projected in the direction A\r\nG; the time, it will take up in arriving at B, will bear the same\r\nproportion to the time, wherein it would fall down through one fourth\r\npart of A E, as A G bears to half A E. But when the body is thrown in\r\nthe direction of A H, the time of its passing to B will bear the same\r\nproportion to the time, wherein it would fall through one fourth part\r\nof A E, as A H bears to half A E.\r\n\r\n91. IF the line A I be drawn so as to divide the angle under E A D in\r\nthe middle, and the line I K be drawn perpendicular to the horizon;\r\nthis line will touch the circle in the point I, and if the body be\r\nthrown in the direction A I, it will fall upon the point K: and this\r\npoint K is the farthest point in the line A D, which the body can be\r\nmade to strike, without increasing its velocity.\r\n\r\n92. THE velocity, wherewith the body every where moves, may be found\r\nthus. Suppose the body to move in the parabola A B (fig. 71.) Erect A\r\nC perpendicular to the horizon, and equal to the height, from which a\r\nbody must fall to acquire the velocity, wherewith the body sets out\r\nfrom A. If you take any points as D and E in the parabola, and draw\r\nD F and E G parallel to the horizon; the velocity of the body in D\r\nwill be equal to what a body will acquire in falling down by its own\r\nweight through C F, and in E the velocity will be the same, as would\r\nbe acquired in falling through C G. Thus the body moves slowest at\r\nthe highest point H of the parabola; and at equal distances from this\r\npoint will move with equal swiftness, and descend from that highest\r\npoint through the line H B altogether like to the line A H in which it\r\nascended; abating only the resistance of the air, which is not here\r\nconsidered. If the line H I be drawn from the highest point H parallel\r\nto the horizon, A I will be equal to ¼ of B G in fig. 70, when the body\r\nis projected in the direction A G, and equal to ¼ of B H, when the body\r\nis thrown in the direction A H provided A D be drawn horizontally.\r\n\r\n93. THUS I have recounted the principal discoveries, which had been\r\nmade concerning the motion of bodies by Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~’S\r\npredecessors; all these discoveries, by being found to agree with\r\nexperience, contributing to establish the laws of motion, from whence\r\nthey were deduced. I shall therefore here finish what I had to say\r\nupon those laws; and conclude this chapter with a few words concerning\r\nthe distinction which ought to be made between absolute and relative\r\nmotion. For some have thought fit to confound them together; because\r\nthey observe the laws of motion to take place here on the earth, which\r\nis in motion, after the same manner as if it were at rest. But Sir\r\n~ISAAC NEWTON~ has been careful to distinguish between the\r\nrelative and absolute consideration both of motion and time[76]. The\r\nastronomers anciently found it necessary to make this distinction in\r\ntime. Time considered in it self passes on equably without relation to\r\nany thing external, being the proper measure of the continuance and\r\nduration of all things. But it is most frequently conceived of by us\r\nunder a relative view to some succession in sensible things, of which\r\nwe take cognizance. The succession of the thoughts in our own minds\r\nis that, from whence we receive our first idea of time, but is a very\r\nuncertain measure thereof; for the thoughts of some men flow on much\r\nmore swiftly, than the thoughts of others; nor does the same person\r\nthink equally quick at all times. The motions of the heavenly bodies\r\nare more regular; and the eminent division of time into night and day,\r\nmade by the sun, leads us to measure our time by the motion of that\r\nluminary: nor do we in the affairs of life concern our selves with any\r\ninequality, which there may be in that motion; but the space of time\r\nwhich comprehends a day and night is rather supposed to be always the\r\nsame. However astronomers anciently found these spaces of time not to\r\nbe always of the same length, and have taught how to compute their\r\ndifferences. Now the time, when so equated as to be rendered perfectly\r\nequal, is the true measure of duration, the other not. And therefore\r\nthis latter, which is absolutely true time, differs from the other,\r\nwhich is only apparent. And as we ordinarily make no distinction\r\nbetween apparent time, as measured by the sun, and the true; so we\r\noften do not distinguish in our usual discourse between the real, and\r\nthe apparent or relative motion of bodies; but use the same words for\r\none, as we should for the other. Though all things about us are really\r\nin motion with the earth; as this motion is not visible, we speak of\r\nthe motion of every thing we see, as if our selves and the earth stood\r\nstill. And even in other cases, where we discern the motion of bodies,\r\nwe often speak of them not in relation to the whole motion we see, but\r\nwith regard to other bodies, to which they are contiguous. If any body\r\nwere lying on a table; when that table shall be carried along, we say\r\nthe body rests upon the table, or perhaps absolutely, that the body is\r\nat rest. However philosophers must not reject all distinction between\r\ntrue and apparent motions, any more than astronomers do the distinction\r\nbetween true and vulgar time; for there is as real a difference between\r\nthem, as will appear by the following consideration. Suppose all the\r\nbodies of the universe to have their courses stopped, and reduced to\r\nperfect rest. Then suppose their present motions to be again restored;\r\nthis cannot be done without an actual impression made upon some of them\r\nat least. If any of them be left untouched, they will retain their\r\nformer state, that is, still remain at rest; but the other bodies,\r\nwhich are wrought upon, will have changed their former state of rest,\r\nfor the contrary state of motion. Let us now suppose the bodies left\r\nat rest to be annihilated, this will make no alteration in the state\r\nof the moving bodies; but the effect of the impression, which was made\r\nupon them, will still subsist. This shews the motion they received to\r\nbe an absolute thing, and to have no necessary dependence upon the\r\nrelation which the body said to be in motion has to any other body[77].\r\n\r\n94. BESIDES absolute and relative motion are distinguishable by their\r\nEffects. One effect of motion is, that bodies, when moved round any\r\ncenter or axis, acquire a certain power, by which they forcibly\r\npress themselves from that center or axis of motion. As when a body\r\nis whirled about in a sling, the body presses against the sling, and\r\nis ready to fly out as soon as liberty is given it. And this power\r\nis proportional to the true, not relative motion of the body round\r\nsuch a center or axis. Of this Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ gives the following\r\ninstance[78]. If a pail or such like vessel near full of water be\r\nsuspended by a string of sufficient length, and be turned about till\r\nthe string be hard twisted. If then as soon as the vessel and water\r\nin it are become still and at rest, the vessel be nimbly turned about\r\nthe contrary way the string was twisted, the vessel by the strings\r\nuntwisting it self shall continue its motion a long time. And when the\r\nvessel first begins to turn, the water in it shall receive little or\r\nnothing of the motion of the vessel, but by degrees shall receive a\r\ncommunication of motion, till at last it shall move round as swiftly\r\nas the vessel it self. Now the definition of motion, which ~DES\r\nCARTES~ has given us upon this principle of making all motion\r\nmeerly relative, is this: that motion, is a removal of any body from\r\nits vicinity to other bodies, which were in immediate contact with\r\nit, and are considered as at rest[79]. And if this be compared with\r\nwhat he soon after says, that there is nothing real or positive in the\r\nbody moved, for the sake of which we ascribe motion to it, which is\r\nnot to be found as well in the contiguous bodies, which are considered\r\nas at rest[80]; it will follow from thence, that we may consider the\r\nvessel as at rest and the water as moving in it: and the water in\r\nrespect of the vessel has the greatest motion, when the vessel first\r\nbegins to turn, and loses this relative motion more and more, till\r\nat length it quite ceases. But now, when the vessel first begins to\r\nturn, the surface of the water remains smooth and flat, as before the\r\nvessel began to move; but as the motion of the vessel communicates by\r\ndegrees motion to the water, the surface of the water will be observed\r\nto change, the water subsiding in the middle and rising at the edges:\r\nwhich elevation of the water is caused by the parts of it pressing from\r\nthe axis, they move about; and therefore this force of receding from\r\nthe axis of motion depends not upon the relative motion of the water\r\nwithin the vessel, but on its absolute motion; for it is least, when\r\nthat relative motion is greatest, and greatest, when that relative\r\nmotion is least, or none at all.\r\n\r\n95. THUS the true cause of what appears in the surface of this water\r\ncannot be assigned, without considering the water’s motion within the\r\nvessel. So also in the system of the world, in order to find out the\r\ncause of the planetary motions, we must know more of the real motions,\r\nwhich belong to each planet, than is absolutely necessary for the uses\r\nof astronomy. If the astronomer should suppose the earth to stand\r\nstill, he could ascribe such motions to the celestial bodies, as should\r\nanswer all the appearances; though he would not account for them in so\r\nsimple a manner, as by attributing motion to the earth. But the motion\r\nof the earth must of necessity be considered, before the real causes,\r\nwhich actuate the planetary system, can be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOf CENTRIPETAL FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have just been describing in the preceding chapter the effects\r\nproduced on a body in motion, from its being continually acted upon\r\nby a power always equal in strength, and operating in parallel\r\ndirections[81]. But bodies may be acted upon by powers, which in\r\ndifferent places shall have different degrees of force, and whose\r\nseveral directions shall be variously inclined to each other. The most\r\nsimple of these in respect to direction is, when the power is pointed\r\nconstantly to one center. This is truly the case of that power, whose\r\neffects we described in the foregoing chapter; though the center of\r\nthat power is so far removed, that the subject then before us is most\r\nconveniently to be considered in the light, wherein we have placed it:\r\nBut Sir ISAAC NEWTON has considered very particularly this other case\r\nof powers, which are constantly directed to the same center. It is upon\r\nthis foundation, that all his discoveries in the system of the world\r\nare raised. And therefore, as this subject bears so very great a share\r\nin the philosophy, of which I am discoursing, I think it proper in this\r\nplace to take a short view of some of the general effects of these\r\npowers, before we come to apply them particularly to the system of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n2. THESE powers or forces are by Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ called centripetal;\r\nand their first effect is to cause the body, on which they act, to quit\r\nthe straight course, wherein it would proceed if undisturbed, and to\r\ndescribe an incurvated line, which shall always be bent towards the\r\ncenter of the force. It is not necessary, that such a power should\r\ncause the body to approach that center. The body may continue to\r\nrecede from the center of the power, notwithstanding its being drawn\r\nby the power; but this property must always belong to its motion, that\r\nthe line, in which it moves, will continually be concave towards the\r\ncenter, to which the power is directed. Suppose A (in fig. 72.) to be\r\nthe center of a force. Let a body in B be moving in the direction of\r\nthe straight line B C, in which line it would continue to move, if\r\nundisturbed; but being attracted by the centripetal force towards A,\r\nthe body must necessarily depart from this line B C, and being drawn\r\ninto the curve line B D, must pass between the lines A B and B C. It is\r\nevident therefore, that the body in B being gradually turned off from\r\nthe straight line B C, it will at first be convex toward the line B C,\r\nand consequently concave towards the point A: for these centripetal\r\npowers are supposed to be in strength proportional to the power of\r\ngravity, and, like that, not to be able after the manner of an impulse\r\nto turn the body sensibly out of its course into a different one in\r\nan instant, but to take up some space of time in producing a visible\r\neffect. That the curve will always continue to have its concavity\r\ntowards A may thus appear. In the line B C near to B take any point as\r\nE, from which the line E F G may be so drawn, as to touch the curve\r\nline B D in some point as F. Now when the body is come to F, if the\r\ncentripetal power were immediately to be suspended, the body would no\r\nlonger continue to move in a curve line, but being left to it self\r\nwould forthwith reassume a straight course; and that straight course\r\nwould be in the line F G: for that line is in the direction of the\r\nbody’s motion at the point F. But the centripetal force continuing its\r\nenergy, the body will be gradually drawn from this line F G so as to\r\nkeep in the line F D, and make that line near the point F to be convex\r\ntoward F G, and concave toward A. After the same manner the body may be\r\nfollowed on in its course through the line B D, and every part of that\r\nline be shewn to be concave toward the point A.\r\n\r\n3. THIS then is the constant character belonging to those motions,\r\nwhich are carried on by centripetal forces; that the line, wherein the\r\nbody moves, is throughout concave towards the center of the force. In\r\nrespect to the successive distances of the body from the center there\r\nis no general rule to be laid down; for the distance of the body from\r\nthe center may either increase, or decrease, or even keep always the\r\nsame. The point A (in fig. 73.) being the center of a centripetal\r\nforce, let a body at B set out in the direction of the straight line B\r\nC perpendicular to the line A B drawn from A to B. It will be easily\r\nconceived, that there is no other point in the line B C so near to A,\r\nas the point B; that A B is the shortest of all the lines, which can\r\nbe drawn from A to any part of the line B C; all other lines, as A D,\r\nor A E, drawn from A to the line B C being longer than A B. Hence it\r\nfollows, that the body setting out from B, if it moved in the line B\r\nC, it would recede more and more from the point A. Now as the operation\r\nof a centripetal force is to draw a body towards the center of the\r\nforce: if such a force act upon a resting body, it must necessarily put\r\nthat body so into motion, as to cause it to move towards the center\r\nof the force: if the body were of it self moving towards that center,\r\nthe centripetal force would accelerate that motion, and cause it to\r\nmove faster down: but if the body were in such a motion, as being left\r\nto itself it would recede from this center, it is not necessary, that\r\nthe action of a centripetal power upon it should immediately compel\r\nthe body to approach the center, from which it would otherwise have\r\nreceded; the centripetal power is not without effect, if it cause the\r\nbody to recede more slowly from that center, than otherwise it would\r\nhave done. Thus in the case before us, the smallest centripetal power,\r\nif it act on the body, will force it out of the line B C, and cause it\r\nto pass in a bent line between B C and the point A, as has been before\r\nexplained. When the body, for instance, has advanced to the line A D,\r\nthe effect of the centripetal force discovers it self by having removed\r\nthe body out of the line B C, and brought it to cross the line A D\r\nsomewhere between A and D: suppose at F. Now A D being longer than A B,\r\nA F may also be longer than A B. The centripetal power may indeed be\r\nso strong, that A F shall be shorter than A B; or it may be so evenly\r\nbalanced with the progressive motion of the body, that A F and A B\r\nshall be just equal: and in this last case, when the centripetal force\r\nis of that strength, as constantly to draw the body as much toward the\r\ncenter, as the progressive motion would carry it off, the body will\r\ndescribe a circle about the center A, this center of the force being\r\nalso the center of the circle.\r\n\r\n4. IF the body, instead of setting out in the line B C perpendicular\r\nto A B, had set out in another line B G more inclined towards the\r\nline A B, moving in the curve line B H; then as the body, if it were\r\nto continue its motion in the line B G, would for some time approach\r\nthe center A; the centripetal force would cause it to make greater\r\nadvances toward that center. But if the body were to set out in the\r\nline B I reclined the other way from the perpendicular B C, and were to\r\nbe drawn by the centripetal force into the curve line B K; the body,\r\nnotwithstanding any centripetal force, would for some time recede from\r\nthe center; since some part at least of the curve line B K lies between\r\nthe line B I and the perpendicular B C.\r\n\r\n5. THUS far we have explained such effects, as attend every centripetal\r\nforce. But as these forces may be very different in regard to the\r\ndifferent degrees of strength, wherewith they act upon bodies in\r\ndifferent places; I shall now proceed to make mention in general of\r\nsome of the differences attending these centripetal motions.\r\n\r\n6. TO reassume the consideration of the last mentioned case. Suppose a\r\ncentripetal power directed toward the point A (in fig. 74.) to act on\r\na body in B, which is moving in the direction of the straight line B\r\nC, the line B C reclining off from A B. If from A the straight lines A\r\nD, A E, A F are drawn at pleasure to the line C B; the line C B being\r\nprolonged beyond B to G, it appears that A D is inclined to the line\r\nG C more obliquely, than A B is inclined to it, A E is inclined more\r\nobliquely than A D, and A F more than A E. To speak more correctly, the\r\nangle under A D G is less than that under A B G, the angle under A E G\r\nless than that under A D G, and the angle under A F G less than that\r\nunder A E G. Now suppose the body to move in the curve line B H I K.\r\nThen it is here likewise evident, that the line B H I K being concave\r\ntowards A, and convex towards the line B C, it is more and more turned\r\noff from the line B C; so that in the point H the line A H will be less\r\nobliquely inclined to the curve line B H I K, than the same line A H\r\nD is inclined to B C at the point D; at the point I the inclination\r\nof the line A I to the curve line will be more different from the\r\ninclination of the same line A I E to the line B C, at the point E;\r\nand in the points K and F the difference of inclination will be still\r\ngreater; and in both the inclination at the curve will be less oblique,\r\nthan at the straight line B C. But the straight line A B is less\r\nobliquely inclined to B G, than A D is inclined towards D G: therefore\r\nalthough the line A H be less obliquely inclined towards the curve H B,\r\nthan the same line A H D is inclined towards D G; yet it is possible,\r\nthat the inclination at H may be more oblique, than the inclination at\r\nB. The inclination at H may indeed be less oblique than the other, or\r\nthey may be both the same. This depends upon the degree of strength,\r\nwherewith the centripetal force exerts it self, during the passage of\r\nthe body from B to H. After the same manner the inclinations at I and K\r\ndepend entirely on the degree of strength, wherewith the centripetal\r\nforce acts on the body in its passage from H to K: if the centripetal\r\nforce be weak enough, the lines A H and A I drawn from the center A to\r\nthe body at H and at I shall be more obliquely inclined to the curve,\r\nthan the line A B is inclined towards B G. The centripetal force may\r\nbe of that strength as to render all these inclinations equal, or if\r\nstronger, the inclinations at I and K will be less oblique than at\r\nB. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has particularly shewn, that if the\r\ncentripetal power decreases after a certain manner with the increase\r\nof distance, a body may describe such a curve line, that all the\r\nlines drawn from the center to the body shall be equally inclined to\r\nthat curve line.[82] But I do not here enter into any particulars, my\r\npresent intention being only to shew, that it is possible for a body to\r\nbe acted upon by a force continually drawing it down towards a center,\r\nand yet that the body shall continue to recede from that center; for\r\nhere as long as the lines A H, A I, &c drawn from the center A to the\r\nbody do not become less oblique to the curve, in which the body moves;\r\nso long shall those lines perpetually increase, and consequently the\r\nbody shall more and more recede from the center.\r\n\r\n7. BUT we may observe farther, that if the centripetal power, while\r\nthe body increases its distance from the center, retain sufficient\r\nstrength to make the lines drawn from the center to the body to become\r\nat length less oblique to the curve; then if this diminution of the\r\nobliquity continue, till at last the line drawn from the center to\r\nthe body shall cease to be obliquely inclined to the curve, and shall\r\nbecome perpendicular thereto; from this instant the body shall no\r\nlonger recede from the center, but in its following motion it shall\r\nagain descend, and shall describe a curve line in all respects like to\r\nthat, which it has described already; provided the centripetal power,\r\nevery where at the same distance from the center, acts with the same\r\nstrength. So we observed in the preceding chapter, that, when the\r\nmotion of a projectile became parallel to the horizon, the projectile\r\nno longer ascended, but forthwith directed its course downwards,\r\ndescending in a line altogether like that, wherein it had before\r\nascended[83].\r\n\r\n8. THIS return of the body may be proved by the following proposition:\r\nthat if the body in any place, suppose at I, were to be stopt, and\r\nbe thrown directly backward with the velocity, wherewith it was\r\nmoving forward in that point I; then the body, by the action of the\r\ncentripetal force upon it, would move back again over the path I H B,\r\nin which it had before advanced forward, and would arrive again at the\r\npoint B in the same space of time, as was taken up in its passage from\r\nB to I; the velocity of the body at its return to the point B being\r\nthe same, as that wherewith it first set out from that point. To give\r\na full demonstration of this proposition, would require that use of\r\nmathematics, which I here purpose to avoid; but, I believe, it will\r\nappear in great measure evident from the following considerations.\r\n\r\n9. SUPPOSE (in fig. 75.) that a body were carried after the following\r\nmanner through the bent figure A B C D E F, composed of the straight\r\nlines A B, B C, C D, D E, E F. First let it be moving in the line A B,\r\nfrom A towards B, with any uniform velocity. At B let the body receive\r\nan impulse directed toward some point, as G, taken within the concavity\r\nof the figure. Now whereas this body, when once moving in the straight\r\nline A B, will continue to move on in this line, so long as it shall be\r\nleft to it self; but being disturbed at the point B in its motion by\r\nthe impulse, which there acts upon it, it will be turned out of this\r\nline A B into some other straight line, wherein it will afterwards\r\ncontinue to move, as long as it shall be left to itself. Therefore\r\nlet this impulse have strength sufficient to turn the body into the\r\nline B C. Then let the body move on undisturbed from B to C, but at C\r\nlet it receive another impulse pointed toward the same point G, and\r\nof sufficient strength to turn the body into the line C D. At D let a\r\nthird impulse, directed like the rest to the point G, turn the body\r\ninto the line D E. And at E let another impulse, directed likewise to\r\nthe point G, turn the body into the line E F. Now, I say, if the body\r\nwhile moving in the line E F be stopt, and turned back again in this\r\nline with the same velocity, as that wherewith it was moving forward in\r\nthis line; then by the repetition of the former impulse at E the body\r\nwill be turned into the line E D, and move in it from E to D with the\r\nsame velocity as before it moved with from D to E; by the repetition of\r\nthe impulse at D, when the body shall have returned to that point, it\r\nwill be turned into the line D C; and by the repetition of the other\r\nimpulses at C and B the body will be brought back again into the line\r\nB A, with the velocity, wherewith it first moved in that line.\r\n\r\n10. THIS I prove as follows. Let D E and F E be continued beyond E. In\r\nD E thus continued take at pleasure the length E H, and let H I be so\r\ndrawn, as to be equidistant from the line G E. Then, by what has been\r\nwritten upon the second law of motion[84], it follows, that after the\r\nimpulse on the body in E it will move through E I in the same time, as\r\nit would have imployed in moving from E to H, with the velocity which\r\nit had in the line D E. In F E prolonged take E K equal to E I, and\r\ndraw K L equidistant from G E. Then, because the body is thrown back in\r\nthe line F E with the same velocity as that wherewith it went forward\r\nin that line; if, when the body was returned to E, it were permitted\r\nto go straight on, it would pass through E K in the same time, as it\r\ntook up in passing through E I, when it went forward in the line E F.\r\nBut, if at the body’s return to the point E, such an impulse directed\r\ntoward the point D were to be given it, whereby it should be turned\r\ninto the line D E; I say, that the impulse necessary to produce this\r\neffect must be equal to that, which turned the body out of the line D E\r\ninto E F; and that the velocity, with which the body will return into\r\nthe line E D, is the same, as that wherewith it before moved through\r\nthis line from D to E. Because E K is equal to E I, and K L and H I,\r\nbeing each equidistant from G E, are by consequence equidistant from\r\neach other; it follows, that the two triangular figures I E H and K\r\nE L are altogether like and equal to each other. If I were writing to\r\nmathematicians, I might refer them to some proportions in the elements\r\nof EUCLID for the proof of this[85] but as I do not here address my\r\nself to such, so I think this assertion will be evident enough without\r\na proof in form; at least I must desire my readers to receive it as a\r\nproposition true in geometry. But these two triangular figures being\r\naltogether like each other and equal; as E K is equal to E I, so E L is\r\nequal to E H, and K L equal to H I. Now the body after its return to\r\nE being turned out of the line F E into E D by an impulse acting upon\r\nit in E, after the manner above expressed; the body will receive such\r\na velocity by this impulse, as will carry it through E L in the same\r\ntime, as it would have imployed in passing through E K, if it had gone\r\non in that line undisturbed. And it has already been observed, that the\r\ntime, in which the body would pass over E K with the velocity wherewith\r\nit returns, is equal to the time it took up in going forward from E to\r\nI; that is, equal to the time, in which it would have gone through E H\r\nwith the velocity, wherewith it moved from D to E. Therefore the time,\r\nin which the body will pass through E L after its return into the line\r\nE D, is the same, as would have been taken up by the body in passing\r\nthrough E H with the velocity, wherewith the body first moved in the\r\nline D E. Since therefore E L and E H are equal, the body returns into\r\nthe line D E with the velocity, which it had before in that line. Again\r\nI say, the second impulse in E is equal to the first. By what has\r\nbeen said on the second law of motion concerning the effect of oblique\r\nimpulses[86], it will be understood, that the impulse in E, whereby\r\nthe body was turned out of the line D E into the line E F, is of such\r\nstrength, that if the body had been at rest, when this impulse had\r\nacted upon it, this impulse would have communicated so much motion to\r\nthe body, as would have carried it through a length equal to H I, in\r\nthe time wherein the body would have passed from E to H, or in the time\r\nwherein it passed from E to I. In the same manner, on the return of the\r\nbody, the impulse in E, whereby the body is turned out of the line F\r\nE into E D, is of such strength, that if it had acted on the body at\r\nrest, it would have caused the body to move through a length equal to\r\nK L, in the same time, as the body would imploy in passing through E K\r\nwith the velocity, wherewith it returns in the line F E. Therefore the\r\nsecond impulse, had it acted on the body at rest, would have caused it\r\nto move through a length equal to K L in the same space of time, as\r\nwould be taken up by the body in passing through a length equal to H I,\r\nwere the first impulse to act on the body when at rest. That is, the\r\neffects of the first and second impulse on the body when at rest would\r\nbe the same; for K L and H I are equal: consequently the second impulse\r\nis equal to the first.\r\n\r\n11. THUS if the body be returned through F E with the velocity,\r\nwherewith it moved forward; we have shewn how by the repetition of the\r\nimpulse, which acted on it at E, the body will return again into the\r\nline D E with the velocity, which it had before in that line. By the\r\nsame process of reasoning it may be proved, that, when the body is\r\nreturned back to D, the impulse, which before acted on the body at that\r\npoint, will throw the body into the line D C with the velocity, which\r\nit first had in that line; and the other impulses being successively\r\nrepeated, the body will at length be brought back again into the line B\r\nA with the velocity, wherewith it set out in that line.\r\n\r\n12. THUS these impulses, by acting over again in an inverted order\r\nall their operation on the body, bring it back again through the\r\npath, in which it had proceeded forward. And this obtains equally,\r\nwhatever be the number of the straight lines, whereof this curve\r\nfigure is composed. Now by a method of reasoning, which Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ makes great use of, and which he introduced into geometry,\r\nthereby greatly inriching that science[87]; we might make a transition\r\nfrom this figure composed of a number of straight lines to a figure\r\nof one continued curvature, and from a number of separate impulses\r\nrepeated at distinct intervals to a continual centripetal force, and\r\nshew, that, because what has been here advanced holds universally\r\ntrue, whatever be the number of straight lines, whereof the curve\r\nfigure A C F is composed, and howsoever frequently the impulses at\r\nthe angles of this figure are repeated; therefore the same will still\r\nremain true, although this figure should be converted into one of a\r\ncontinued curvature, and these distinct impulses should be changed\r\ninto a continual centripetal force. But as the explaining this method\r\nof reasoning is foreign to my present design; so I hope my readers,\r\nafter what has been said, will find no difficulty in receiving the\r\nproposition laid down above: that, if the body, which has moved through\r\nthe curve line B H I (in fig. 74.) from B to I, when it is come to I,\r\nbe thrown directly back with the same velocity as that, wherewith it\r\nproceeded forward, the centripetal force, by acting over again all its\r\noperation on the body, shall bring the body back again in the line I H\r\nB: and as the motion of the body in its course from B to I was every\r\nwhere in such a manner oblique to the line drawn from the center to\r\nthe body, that the centripetal power acted in some degree against the\r\nbody’s motion, and gradually diminished it; so in the return of the\r\nbody, the centripetal power will every where draw the body forward, and\r\naccelerate its motion by the same degrees, as before it retarded it.\r\n\r\n13. THIS being agreed, suppose the body in K to have the line A K no\r\nlonger obliquely inclined to its motion. In this case, if the body\r\nbe turned back, in the manner we have been considering, it must be\r\ndirected back perpendicularly to A K. But if it had proceeded forward,\r\nit would likewise have moved in a direction perpendicular to A K;\r\nconsequently, whether it move from this point K backward or forward, it\r\nmust describe the same kind of course. Therefore since by being turned\r\nback it will go over again the line K I H B; if it be permitted to go\r\nforward, the line K L, which it shall describe, will be altogether\r\nsimilar to the line K H B.\r\n\r\n14. IN like manner we may determine the nature of the motion, if\r\nthe line, wherein the body sets out, be inclined (as in fig. 76.)\r\ndown toward the line B A drawn between the body and the center. If\r\nthe centripetal power so much increases in strength, as the body\r\napproaches, that it can bend the path, in which the body moves, to\r\nthat degree, as to cause all the lines as A H, A I, A K to remain no\r\nless oblique to the motion of the body, than A B is oblique to B C;\r\nthe body shall continually more and more approach the center. But if\r\nthe centripetal power increases in so much less a degree, as to permit\r\nthe line drawn from the center to the body, as it accompanies the\r\nbody in its motion, at length to become more and more erect to the\r\ncurve wherein the body moves, and in the end, suppose at K, to become\r\nperpendicular thereto; from that time the body shall rise again. This\r\nis evident from what has been said above; because for the very same\r\nreason here also the body shall proceed from the point K to describe a\r\nline altogether similar to the line, in which it has moved from B to K.\r\nThus, as it was observed of the pendulum in the preceding chapter[88],\r\nthat all the time it approaches towards being perpendicular to the\r\nhorizon, it more and more descends; but, as soon as it is come into\r\nthat perpendicular situation, it immediately rises again by the same\r\ndegrees, as it descended by before: so here the body more and more\r\napproaches the center all the time it is moving from B to K; but thence\r\nforward it rises from the center again by the same degrees, as it\r\napproached by before.\r\n\r\n15. IF (in fig. 77.) the line B C be perpendicular to A B; then it has\r\nbeen observed above[89], that the centripetal power may be so balanced\r\nwith the progressive motion of the body, that the body may keep moving\r\nround the center A constantly at the same distance; as a body does,\r\nwhen whirled about any point, to which it is tyed by a string. If the\r\ncentripetal power be too weak to produce this effect, the motion of\r\nthe body will presently become oblique to the line drawn from itself\r\nto the center, after the manner of the first of the two cases, which\r\nwe have been considering. If the centripetal power be stronger, than\r\nwhat is required to carry the body in a circle, the motion of the body\r\nwill presently fall in with the second of the cases, we have been\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n16. IF the centripetal power so change with the change of distance,\r\nthat the body, after its motion has become oblique to the line drawn\r\nfrom itself to the center, shall again become perpendicular thereto;\r\nwhich we have shewn to be possible in both the cases treated of\r\nabove; then the body shall in its subsequent motion return again to\r\nthe distance of A B, and from that distance take a course similar\r\nto the former: and thus, if the body move in a space free from all\r\nresistance, which has been here all along supposed; it shall continue\r\nin a perpetual motion about the center, descending and ascending\r\nalternately therefrom. If the body setting out from B (in fig. 78.) in\r\nthe line B C perpendicular to A B, describe the line B D E, which in D\r\nshall be oblique to the line A D, but in E shall again become erect to\r\nA E drawn from the body in E to the center A; then from this point E\r\nthe body shall describe the line E F G altogether like to the line B D\r\nE, and at G shall be at the same distance from A, as it was at B. But\r\nlikewise the line A G shall be erect to the body’s motion. Therefore\r\nthe body shall proceed to describe from G the line G H I altogether\r\nsimilar to the line G F E, and at I have the same distance from the\r\ncenter, as it had at E; and also have the line A I erect to its motion:\r\nso that its following motion must be in the line I K L similar to I H\r\nG, and the distance A L equal to A G. Thus the body will go on in a\r\nperpetual round without ceasing, alternately inlarging and contracting\r\nits distance from the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n17. IF it so happen, that the point E fall upon the line B A continued\r\nbeyond A; then the point G will fall on B, I on E, and L also on B;\r\nso that the body will describe in this case a simple curve line round\r\nthe center A, like the line B D E F in fig. 79, in which it will\r\ncontinually revolve from B to E and from E to B without end.\r\n\r\n18. IF A E in fig. 78 should happen to be perpendicular to A B, in this\r\ncase also a simple line will be described; for the point G will fall on\r\nthe line B A prolonged beyond A, the point I on the line A E prolonged\r\nbeyond A, and the point L on B: so that the body will describe a line\r\nlike the curve line B E G I in fig. 80, in which the opposite points B\r\nand G are equally distant from A, and the opposite points E and I are\r\nalso equally distant from the same point A.\r\n\r\n19. IN other cases the line described will have a more complex figure.\r\n\r\n20. THUS we have endeavoured to shew how a body, while it is constantly\r\nattracted towards a center, may notwithstanding by its progressive\r\nmotion keep it self from falling down to that center; but describe\r\nabout it an endless circuit, sometimes approaching toward that center,\r\nand at other times as much receding from the same.\r\n\r\n21. BUT here we have supposed, that the centripetal power is of equal\r\nstrength every where at the same distance from the center. And this is\r\nthe case of that centripetal power, which will hereafter be shewn to be\r\nthe cause, that keeps the planets in their courses. But a body may be\r\nkept on in a perpetual circuit round a center, although the centripetal\r\npower have not this property. Indeed a body may by a centripetal\r\nforce be kept moving in any curve line whatever, that shall have its\r\nconcavity turned every where towards the center of the force.\r\n\r\n22. TO make this evident I shall first propose the case of a body\r\nmoving through the incurvated figure A B C D E (in fig. 81.) which is\r\ncomposed of the straight lines A B, B C, C D, D E, and E A; the motion\r\nbeing carried on in the following manner. Let the body first move in\r\nthe line A B with any uniform velocity. When it is arrived at the point\r\nB, let it receive an impulse directed toward any point F taken within\r\nthe figure; and let the impulse be of that strength as to turn the body\r\nout of the line A B into the line B C. The body after this impulse,\r\nwhile left to itself, will continue moving in the line B C. At C let\r\nthe body receive another impulse directed towards the same point F, of\r\nsuch strength, as to turn the body from the line B C into the line C D.\r\nAt D let the body by another impulse, directed likewise to the point F,\r\nbe turned out of the line C D into D E. And at E let another impulse,\r\ndirected toward the point F, turn the body from the line D E into E\r\nA. Thus we see how a body may be carried through the figure A B C D E\r\nby certain impulses directed always toward the same center, only by\r\ntheir acting on the body at proper intervals, and with due degrees of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n23. BUT farther, when the body is come to the point A, if it there\r\nreceive another impulse directed like the rest toward the point F, and\r\nof such a degree of strength as to turn the body into the line A B,\r\nwherein it first moved; I say that the body shall return into this line\r\nwith the same velocity, as it had at first.\r\n\r\n24. LET A B be prolonged beyond B at pleasure, suppose to G; and from G\r\nlet G H be drawn, which if produced should always continue equidistant\r\nfrom B F, or, according to the more usual phrase, let G H be drawn\r\nparallel to B F. Then it appears, from what has been said upon the\r\nsecond law of motion[90], that in the time, wherein the body would have\r\nmoved from B to G, had it not received a new impulse in B, by the means\r\nof that impulse it will have acquired a velocity, which will carry it\r\nfrom B to H. After the same manner, if C I be taken equal to B H,\r\nand I K be drawn equidistant from or parallel to C F; the body will\r\nhave moved from C to K with the velocity, which it has in the line C\r\nD, in the same time, as it would have employed in moving from C to I\r\nwith the velocity, it had in the line B C. Therefore since C I and B\r\nH are equal, the body will move through C K in the same time, as it\r\nwould have taken up in moving from B to G with the original velocity,\r\nwherewith it moved through the line A B. Again, D L being taken equal\r\nto C K and L M drawn parallel to D F; for the same reason as before the\r\nbody will move through D M with the velocity, which it has in the line\r\nD E, in the same time, as it would imploy in moving through B G with\r\nits original velocity. In the last place, if E N be taken equal to D M,\r\nand N O be drawn parallel to E F; likewise if A P be taken equal to E\r\nO, and P Q be drawn parallel to A F: then the body with the velocity,\r\nwherewith it returns into the line A B, will pass through A Q in the\r\nsame time, as it would have imployed in passing through B G with its\r\noriginal velocity. Now as all this follows directly from what has above\r\nbeen delivered, concerning the effect of oblique impulses impressed\r\nupon bodies in motion; so we must here observe farther, that it can be\r\nproved by geometry, that A Q will always be equal to E G. The proof of\r\nthis I am obliged, from the nature of my present design, to omit; but\r\nthis geometrical proportion being granted, it follows, that the body\r\nhas returned into the line A B with the velocity, which it had, when\r\nit first moved in that line; for the velocity, with which it returns\r\ninto the line A B, will carry it over the line A Q in the same time, as\r\nwould have been taken up in its passing over an equal line B G with\r\nthe original velocity.\r\n\r\n25. THUS we have found, how a body may be carried round the figure A\r\nB C D E by the action of certain impulses upon it which should all be\r\npointed toward one center. And we likewise see, that when the body is\r\nbrought back again to the point, whence it first set out; if it there\r\nmeet with an impulse sufficient to turn it again into the line, wherein\r\nit moved at first, its original velocity will be again restored; and by\r\nthe repetition of the same impulses, the body will be carried again in\r\nthe same round. Therefore if these impulses, which act on the body at\r\nthe points B, C, D, E, and A, continue always the same, the body will\r\nmake round this figure innumerable revolutions.\r\n\r\n26. THE proof, which we have here made use of, holds the same in any\r\nnumber of straight lines, whereof the figure A B D should be composed;\r\nand therefore by the method of reasoning referred to above[91] we are\r\nto conclude, that what has here been said upon this rectilinear figure,\r\nwill remain true, if this figure were changed into one of a continued\r\ncurvature, and instead of distinct impulses acting by intervals at the\r\nangles of this figure, we had a continual centripetal force. We have\r\ntherefore shewn, that a body may be carried round in any curve figure\r\nA B C ( fig. 82.) which shall every where be concave towards any one\r\npoint as D, by the continual action of a centripetal power directed to\r\nthat point, and when it is returned to the point, from whence it set\r\nout, it shall recover again the velocity, with which it departed from\r\nthat point. It is not indeed always necessary, that it should return\r\nagain into its first course; for the curve line may have some such\r\nfigure as the line A B C D B E in fig. 83. In this curve line, if the\r\nbody set out from B in the direction B F, and moved through the line B\r\nC D, till it returned to B; here the body would not enter again into\r\nthe line B C D, because the two parts B D and B C of the curve line\r\nmake an angle at the point B: so that the centripetal power, which at\r\nthe point B could turn the body from the line B F into the curve, will\r\nnot be able to turn the body into the line B C from the direction, in\r\nwhich it returns to the point B; a forceable impulse must be given the\r\nbody in the point B to produce that effect.\r\n\r\n27. IF at the point B, whence the body sets out, the curve line return\r\ninto it self (as in fig. 82;) then the body, upon its arrival again at\r\nB, may return into its former course, and thus make an endless circuit\r\nabout the center of the centripetal power.\r\n\r\n28. WHAT has here been said, I hope, will in some measure enable my\r\nreaders to form a just idea of the nature of these centripetal motions.\r\n\r\n29. I HAVE not attempted to shew, how to find particularly, what kind\r\nof centripetal force is necessary to carry a body in any curve line\r\nproposed. This is to be deduced from the degree of curvature, which\r\nthe figure has in each point of it, and requires a long and complex\r\nmathematical reasoning. However I shall speak a little to the first\r\nproportion, which Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ lays down for this\r\npurpose. By this proposition, when a body is found moving in a curve\r\nline, it may be known, whether the body be kept in its course by a\r\npower always pointed toward the same center; and if it be so, where\r\nthat center is placed. The proposition is this: that if a line be drawn\r\nfrom some fixed point to the body, and remaining by one extream united\r\nto that point, it be carried round along with the body; then, if the\r\npower, whereby the body is kept in its course, be always pointed to\r\nthis fixed point as a center, this line will move over equal spaces in\r\nequal portions of time. Suppose a body were moving through the curve\r\nline A B C D (in fig. 84.) and passed over the arches A B, B C, C D\r\nin equal portions of time; then if a point, as E, can be found, from\r\nwhence the line E A being drawn to the body in A, and accompanying the\r\nbody in its motion, it shall make the spaces E A B, E B C, and E C D\r\nequal, over which it passes, while the body describes the arches A B, B\r\nC, and C D: and if this hold the same in all other arches, both great\r\nand small, of the curve line A B C D, that these spaces are always\r\nequal, where the times are equal; then is the body kept in this line by\r\na power always pointed to E as a center.\r\n\r\n30. THE principle, upon which Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has\r\ndemonstrated this, requires but small skill in geometry to comprehend.\r\nI shall therefore take the liberty to close the present chapter with\r\nan explication of it; because such an example will give the clearest\r\nnotion of our author’s method of applying mathematical reasoning to\r\nthese philosophical subjects.\r\n\r\n31. HE reasons thus. Suppose a body set out from the point A (in fig.\r\n85.) to move in the straight line A B; and after it had moved for some\r\ntime in that line, it were to receive an impulse directed to some point\r\nas C. Let it receive that impulse at D; and thereby be turned into the\r\nline D E; and let the body after this impulse take the same length of\r\ntime in passing from D to E, as it imployed in the passing from A to\r\nD. Then the straight lines C A, C D, and C E being drawn, Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ proves, that the and triangular spaces C A D and C D E are\r\nequal. This he does in the following manner.\r\n\r\n32. LET E F be drawn parallel to C D. Then, from what has been said\r\nupon the second law of motion[92], it is evident, that since the\r\nbody was moving in the line A B, when it received the impulse in the\r\ndirection D C; it will have moved after that impulse through the line\r\nD E in the same time, as it would have taken up in moving through D\r\nF, provided it had received no disturbance in D. But the time of the\r\nbody’s moving from D to E is supposed to be equal to the time of its\r\nmoving through A D; therefore the time, which the body would have\r\nimployed in moving through D F, had it not been disturbed in D, is\r\nequal to the time, wherein it moved through A D: consequently D F is\r\nequal in length to A D; for if the body had gone on to move through\r\nthe line A B without interruption, it would have moved through all\r\nparts thereof with the same velocity, and have passed over equal parts\r\nof that line in equal portions of time. Now C F being drawn, since\r\nA D and D F are equal, the triangular space C D F is equal to the\r\ntriangular space C A D. Farther, the line E F being parallel to C D, it\r\nis proved by EUCLID, that the triangle C E D is equal to the triangle C\r\nF D[93]: therefore the triangle C E D is equal to the triangle C A D.\r\n\r\n33. AFTER the same manner, if the body receive at E another impulse\r\ndirected toward the point C, and be turned by that impulse into the\r\nline E G; if it move afterwards from E to G in the same space of time,\r\nas was taken up by its motion from D to E, or from A to D; then C G\r\nbeing drawn, the triangle C E G is equal to C D E. A third impulse at\r\nG directed as the two former to C, whereby the body shall be turned\r\ninto the line G H, will have also the like effect with the rest. If the\r\nbody move over G H in the same time, as it took up in moving over E\r\nG, the triangle C G H will be equal to the triangle C E G. Lastly, if\r\nthe body at H be turned by a fresh impulse directed toward C into the\r\nline H I, and at I by another impulse directed also to C be turned into\r\nthe line I K; and if the body move over each of the lines H I, and I K\r\nin the same time, as it imployed in moving over each of the preceding\r\nlines A D, D E, E G, and G H: then each of the triangles C H I, and C\r\nI K will be equal to each of the preceding. Likewise as the time, in\r\nwhich the body moves over A D E, is equal to the time of its moving\r\nover E G H, and to the time of its moving over H I K; the space C A D\r\nE will be equal to the space C E G H, and to the space C H I K. In the\r\nsame manner as the time, in which the body moved over A D E G is equal\r\nto the time of its moving over G H I K, so the space C A D E G will be\r\nequal to the space C G H I K.\r\n\r\n34. FROM this principle Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ demonstrates the proposition\r\nmentioned above, by that method of arguing introduced by him into\r\ngeometry, whereof we have before taken notice[94], by making according\r\nto the principles of that method a transition from this incurvated\r\nfigure composed of straight lines, to a figure of continued curvature;\r\nand by shewing, that since equal spaces are described in equal times\r\nin this present figure composed of straight lines, the same relation\r\nbetween the spaces described and the times of their description will\r\nalso have place in a figure of one continued curvature. He also deduces\r\nfrom this proposition the reverse of it; and proves, that whenever\r\nequal spaces are continually described; the body is acted upon by\r\na centripetal force directed to the center, at which the spaces\r\nterminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOf the RESISTANCE of FLUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE the cause can be discovered, which keeps the planets in motion,\r\nit is necessary first to know, whether the space, wherein they move, is\r\nempty and void, or filled with any quantity of matter. It has been a\r\nprevailing opinion, that all space contains in it matter of some kind\r\nor other; so that where no sensible matter is found, there was yet a\r\nsubtle fluid substance by which the space was filled up; even so as\r\nto make an absolute plenitude. In order to examine this opinion, Sir\r\n~ISAAC NEWTON~ has largely considered the effects of fluids upon bodies\r\nmoving in them.\r\n\r\n2. THESE effects he has reduced under these three heads. In the\r\nfirst place he shews how to determine in what manner the resistance,\r\nwhich bodies suffer, when moving in a fluid, gradually increases in\r\nproportion to the space, they describe in any fluid; to the velocity,\r\nwith which they describe it; and to the time they have been in motion.\r\nUnder the second head he considers what degree of resistance different\r\nbodies moving in the same fluid undergo, according to the different\r\nproportion between the density of the fluid and the density of the\r\nbody. The densities of bodies, whether fluid or solid, are measured by\r\nthe quantity of matter, which is comprehended under the same magnitude;\r\nthat body being the most dense or compact, which under the same bulk\r\ncontains the greatest quantity of solid matter, or which weighs most,\r\nthe weight of every body being observed above to be proportional\r\nto the quantity of matter in it[95]. Thus water is more dense than\r\ncork or wood, iron more dense than water, and gold than iron. The\r\nthird particular Sir ~IS. NEWTON~ considers concerning the\r\nresistance of fluids is the influence, which the diversity of figure in\r\nthe resisted body has upon its resistance.\r\n\r\n3. FOR the more perfect illustration of the first of these heads, he\r\ndistinctly shews the relation between all the particulars specified\r\nupon three different suppositions. The first is, that the same body\r\nbe resisted more or less in the simple proportion to its velocity; so\r\nthat if its velocity be doubled, its resistance shall become threefold.\r\nThe second is of the resistance increasing in the duplicate proportion\r\nof the velocity; so that, if the velocity of a body be doubled, its\r\nresistance shall be rendered four times; and if the velocity be\r\ntrebled, nine times as great as at first. But what is to be understood\r\nby duplicate proportion has been already explained[96]. The third\r\nsupposition is, that the resistance increases partly in the single\r\nproportion of the velocity, and partly in the duplicate proportion\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n4. IN all these suppositions, bodies are considered under two respects,\r\neither as moving, and opposing themselves against the fluid by\r\nthat power alone, which is essential to them, of resisting to the\r\nchange of their state from rest to motion, or from motion to rest,\r\nwhich we have above called their power of inactivity; or else, as\r\ndescending or ascending, and so having the power of gravity combined\r\nwith that other power. Thus our author has shewn in all those three\r\nsuppositions, in what manner bodies are resisted in an uniform fluid,\r\nwhen they move with the aforesaid progressive motion[97]; and what the\r\nresistance is, when they ascend or descend perpendicularly[98]. And\r\nif a body ascend or descend obliquely, and the resistance be singly\r\nproportional to the velocity, it is shewn how the body is resisted in\r\na fluid of an uniform density, and what line it will describe[99],\r\nwhich is determined by the measurement of the hyperbola, and appears\r\nto be no other than that line, first considered in particular by Dr.\r\n~BARROW~[100], which is now commonly known by the name of the\r\nlogarithmical curve. In the supposition that the resistance increases\r\nin the duplicate proportion of the velocity, our author has not given\r\nus the line which would be described in an uniform fluid; but has\r\ninstead thereof discussed a problem, which is in some sort the reverse;\r\nto find the density of the fluid at all altitudes, by which any given\r\ncurve line may be described; which problem is so treated by him, as\r\nto be applicable to any kind of resistance whatever[101]. But here\r\nnot unmindful of practice, he shews that a body in a fluid of uniform\r\ndensity, like the air, will describe a line, which approaches towards\r\nan hyperbola; that is, its motion will be nearer to that curve line\r\nthan to the parabola. And consequent upon this remark, he shews how to\r\ndetermine this hyperbola by experiment, and briefly resolves the chief\r\nof those problems relating to projectiles, which are in use in the art\r\nof gunnery, in this curve[102]; as ~TORRICELLI~ and others\r\nhave done in the parabola[103], whose inventions have been explained at\r\nlarge above[104].\r\n\r\n5. OUR author has also handled distinctly that particular sort of\r\nmotion, which is described by pendulums[105]; and has likewise\r\nconsidered some few cases of bodies moving in resisting fluids round a\r\ncenter, to which they are impelled by a centripetal force, in order to\r\ngive an idea of those kinds of motions[106].\r\n\r\n6. THE treating of the resistance of pendulums has given him\r\nan opportunity of inserting into another part of his work some\r\nspeculations upon the motions of them without resistance, which have\r\na very peculiar elegance; where in he treats of them as moved by a\r\ngravitation acting in the law, which he shews to belong to the earth\r\nbelow its surface[107]; performing in this kind of gravitation, where\r\nthe force is proportional to the distance from the center, all that\r\nHUYGENS had before done in the common supposition of its being uniform,\r\nand acting in parallel lines[108].\r\n\r\n7. HUYGENS at the end of his treatise of the cause of gravity[109]\r\ninforms us, that he likewise had carried his speculations on the\r\nfirst of these suppositions, of the resistance in fluids being\r\nproportional to the velocity of the body, as far as our author. But\r\nfinding by experiment that the second was more conformable to nature,\r\nhe afterwards made some progress in that, till he was stopt, by not\r\nbeing able to execute to his wish what related to the perpendicular\r\ndescent of bodies; not observing that the measurement of the curve\r\nline, he made use of to explain it by, depended on the hyperbola.\r\nWhich oversight may well be pardoned in that great man, considering\r\nthat our author had not been pleased at that time to communicate to\r\nthe publick his admirable discourse of the QUADRATURE or MEASUREMENT\r\nOF CURVE LINES, with which he has since obliged the world: for without\r\nthe use of that treatise, it is I think no injury even to our author’s\r\nunparalleled abilities to believe, it would not have been easy for\r\nhimself to have succeeded so happily in this and many other parts of\r\nhis writings.\r\n\r\n8. WHAT HUYGENS found by experiment, that bodies were in reality\r\nresisted in the duplicate proportion of their velocity, agrees with the\r\nreasoning of our author[110], who distinguishes the resistance, which\r\nfluids give to bodies by the tenacity of their parts, and the friction\r\nbetween them and the body, from that, which arises from the power of\r\ninactivity, with which the constituent particles of fluids are endued\r\nlike all other portions of matter, by which power the particles of\r\nfluids like other bodies make resistance against being put into motion.\r\n\r\n9. THE resistance, which arises from the friction of the body\r\nagainst the parts of the fluid, must be very inconsiderable; and the\r\nresistance, which follows from the tenacity of the parts of fluids, is\r\nnot usually very great, and does not depend much upon the velocity of\r\nthe body in the fluid; for as the parts of the fluid adhere together\r\nwith a certain degree of force, the resistance, which the body receives\r\nfrom thence, cannot much depend upon the velocity, with which the body\r\nmoves; but like the power of gravity, its effect must be proportional\r\nto the time of its acting. This the reader may find farther explained\r\nby Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ himself in the postscript to a discourse\r\npublished by me in THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS, N^o 371. The\r\nprincipal resistance, which most fluids give to bodies, arises from the\r\npower of inactivity in the parts of the fluids, and this depends upon\r\nthe velocity, with which the body moves, on a double account. In the\r\nfirst place, the quantity of the fluid moved out of place by the moving\r\nbody in any determinate space of time is proportional to the velocity,\r\nwherewith the body moves; and in the next place, the velocity with\r\nwhich each particle of the fluid is moved, will also be proportional\r\nto the velocity of the body: therefore since the resistance, which\r\nany body makes against being put into motion, is proportional both\r\nto the quantity of matter moved and the velocity it is moved with;\r\nthe resistance, which a fluid gives on this account, will be doubly\r\nincreased with the increase of the velocity in the moving body; that\r\nis, the resistance will be in a two-fold or duplicate proportion of the\r\nvelocity, wherewith the body moves through the fluid.\r\n\r\n10. FARTHER it is most manifest, that this latter kind of resistance\r\nincreasing with the increase of velocity, even in a greater degree than\r\nthe velocity it self increases, the swifter the body moves, the less\r\nproportion the other species of resistance will bear to this: nay that\r\nthis part of the resistance may be so much augmented by a due increase\r\nof velocity, till the former resistances shall bear a less proportion\r\nto this, than any that might be assigned. And indeed experience shews,\r\nthat no other resistance, than what arises from the power of inactivity\r\nin the parts of the fluid, is of moment, when the body moves with any\r\nconsiderable swiftness.\r\n\r\n11. THERE is besides these yet another species of resistance, found\r\nonly in such fluids, as, like our air, are elastic. Elasticity belongs\r\nto no fluid known to us beside the air. By this property any quantity\r\nof air may be contracted into a less space by a forcible pressure, and\r\nas soon as the compressing power is removed, it will spring out again\r\nto its former dimensions. The air we breath is held to its present\r\ndensity by the weight of the air above us. And as this incumbent\r\nweight, by the motion of the winds, or other causes, is frequently\r\nvaried (which appears by the barometer;) so when this weight is\r\ngreatest, we breath a more dense air than at other times. To what\r\ndegree the air would expand it self by its spring, if all pressure\r\nwere removed, is not known, nor yet into how narrow a compass it is\r\ncapable of being compressed. Mr. BOYLE found it by experiment capable\r\nboth of expansion and compression to such a degree, that he could cause\r\na quantity of air to expand it self over a space some hundred thousand\r\ntimes greater, than the space to which he could confine the same\r\nquantity[111]. But I shall treat more fully of this spring in the air\r\nhereafter[112]. I am now only to consider what resistance to the motion\r\nof bodies arises from it.\r\n\r\n12. BUT before our author shews in what manner this cause of resistance\r\noperates, he proposes a method, by which fluids may be rendered\r\nelastic, demonstrating that if their particles be provided with a power\r\nof repelling each other, which shall exert it self with degrees of\r\nstrength reciprocally proportional to the distances between the centers\r\nof the particles; that then such fluids will observe the same rule in\r\nbeing compressed, as our air does, which is this, that the space, into\r\nwhich it yields upon compression, is reciprocally proportional to the\r\ncompressing weight[113]. The term reciprocally proportional has been\r\nexplained above[114]. And if the centrifugal force of the particles\r\nacted by other laws, such fluids would yield in a different manner to\r\ncompression[115].\r\n\r\n13. WHETHER the particles of the air be endued with such a power,\r\nby which they can act upon each other out of contact, our author\r\ndoes not determine, but leaves that to future examination, and to\r\nbe discussed by philosophers. Only he takes occasion from hence to\r\nconsider the resistance in elastic fluids, under this notion; making\r\nremarks, as he passes along, upon the differences, which will arise,\r\nif their elasticity be derived from any other fountain[116]. And this,\r\nI think, must be confessed to be done by him with great judgment;\r\nfor this is far the most reasonable account, which has been given of\r\nthis surprizing power, as must without doubt be freely acknowledged\r\nby any one, who in the least considers the insufficiency of all the\r\nother conjectures, which have been framed; and also how little reason\r\nthere is to deny to bodies other powers, by which they may act upon\r\neach other at a distance, as well as that of gravity; which we shall\r\nhereafter shew to be a property universally belonging to all the bodies\r\nof the universe, and to all their parts[117]. Nay we actually find\r\nin the loadstone a very apparent repelling, as well as an attractive\r\npower. But of this more in the conclusion of this discourse.\r\n\r\n14. BY these steps our author leads the way to explain the resistance,\r\nwhich the air and such like fluids will give to bodies by their\r\nelasticity; which resistance he explains thus. If the elastic power\r\nof the fluid were to be varied so, as to be always in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the velocity of the resisted body, it is shewn that\r\nthen the resistance derived from the elasticity, would increase in\r\nthe duplicate proportion of the velocity; in so much that the whole\r\nresistance would be in that proportion, excepting only that small\r\npart, which arises from the friction between the body and the parts\r\nof the fluid. From whence it follows, that because the elastic power\r\nof the same fluid does in truth continue the same, if the velocity of\r\nthe moving body be diminished, the resistance from the elasticity, and\r\ntherefore the whole resistance, will decrease in a less proportion,\r\nthan the duplicate of the velocity; and if the velocity be increased,\r\nthe resistance from the elasticity will increase in a less proportion,\r\nthan the duplicate of the velocity, that is in a less proportion, than\r\nthe resistance made by the power of inactivity of the parts of the\r\nfluid. And from this foundation is raised the proof of a property of\r\nthis resistance, given by the elasticity in common with the others from\r\nthe tenacity and friction of the parts of the fluid; that the velocity\r\nmay be increased, till this resistance from the fluid’s elasticity\r\nshall bear no considerable proportion to that, which is produced by the\r\npower of inactivity thereof[118]. From whence our author draws this\r\nconclusion; that the resistance of a body, which moves very swiftly in\r\nan elastic fluid, is near the same, as if the fluid were not elastic;\r\nprovided the elasticity arises from the centrifugal power of the\r\nparts of the medium, as before explained, especially if the velocity\r\nbe so great, that this centrifugal power shall want time to exert it\r\nself[119]. But it is to be observed, that in the proof of all this our\r\nauthor proceeds upon the supposition of this centrifugal power in the\r\nparts of the fluid; but if the elasticity be caused by the expansion\r\nof the parts in the manner of wool compressed, and such like bodies,\r\nby which the parts of the fluid will be in some measure entangled\r\ntogether, and their motion be obstructed, the fluid will be in a manner\r\ntenacious, and give a resistance upon that account over and above what\r\ndepends upon its elasticity only[120]; and the resistance derived from\r\nthat cause is to be judged of in the manner before set down.\r\n\r\n15. IT is now time to pass to the second part of this theory; which\r\nis to assign the measure of resistance, according to the proportion\r\nbetween the density of the body and the density of the fluid. What\r\nis here to be understood by the word density has been explained\r\nabove[121]. For this purpose as our author before considered two\r\ndistinct cases of bodies moving in mediums; one when they opposed\r\nthemselves to the fluid by their power of inactivity only, and another\r\nwhen by ascending or descending their weight was combined with that\r\nother power: so likewise, the fluids themselves are to be regarded\r\nunder a double capacity; either as having their parts at rest, and\r\ndisposed freely without restraint, or as being compressed together by\r\ntheir own weight, or any other cause.\r\n\r\n16. IN the first case, if the parts of the fluid be wholly disingaged\r\nfrom one another, so that each particle is at liberty to move all ways\r\nwithout any impediment, it is shewn, that if a globe move in such\r\na fluid, and the globe and particles of the fluid are endued with\r\nperfect elasticity; so that as the globe impinges upon the particles\r\nof it, they shall bound off and separate themselves from the globe,\r\nwith the same velocity, with which the globe strikes upon them; then\r\nthe resistance, which the globe moving with any known velocity suffers,\r\nis to be thus determined. From the velocity of the globe, the time,\r\nwherein it would move over two third parts of its own diameter with\r\nthat velocity, will be known. And such proportion as the density of the\r\nfluid bears to the density of the globe, the same the resistance given\r\nto the globe will bear to the force, which acting, like the power of\r\ngravity, on the globe without intermission during the space of time now\r\nmentioned, would generate in the globe the same degree of motion, as\r\nthat wherewith it moves in the fluid[122]. But if neither the globe nor\r\nthe particles of the fluid be elastic, so that the particles, when the\r\nglobe strikes against them, do not rebound from it, then the resistance\r\nwill be but half so much[123]. Again, if the particles of the fluid and\r\nthe globe are imperfectly elastic, so that the particles will spring\r\nfrom the globe with part only of that velocity wherewith the globe\r\nimpinges upon them; then the resistance will be a mean between the two\r\npreceding cases, approaching nearer to the first or second, according\r\nas the elasticity is more or less[124].\r\n\r\n17. THE elasticity, which is here ascribed to the particles of the\r\nfluid, is not that power of repelling one another, when out of\r\ncontact, by which, as has before been mentioned, the whole fluid may be\r\nrendred elastic; but such an elasticity only, as many solid bodies have\r\nof recovering their figure, whenever any forcible change is made in it,\r\nby the impulse of another body or otherwise. Which elasticity has been\r\nexplained above at large[125].\r\n\r\n18. THIS is the case of discontinued fluids, where the body, by\r\npressing against their particles, drives them before itself, while\r\nthe space behind the body is left empty. But in fluids which are\r\ncompressed, so that the parts of them removed out of place by the body\r\nresisted immediately retire behind the body, and fill that space, which\r\nin the other case is left vacant, the resistance is still less; for a\r\nglobe in such a fluid which shall be free from all elasticity, will\r\nbe resisted but half as much as the least resistance in the former\r\ncase[126]. But by elasticity I now mean that power, which renders\r\nthe whole fluid so; of which if the compressed fluid be possessed,\r\nin the manner of the air, then the resistance will be greater than\r\nby the foregoing rule; for the fluid being capable in some degree\r\nof condensation, it will resemble so far the case of uncompressed\r\nfluids[127]. But, as has been before related, this difference is most\r\nconsiderable in slow motions.\r\n\r\n19. IN the next place our author is particular in determining the\r\ndegrees of resistance accompanying bodies of different figures; which\r\nis the last of the three heads, we divided the whole discourse of\r\nresistance into. And in this disquisition he finds a very surprizing\r\nand unthought of difference, between free and compressed fluids.\r\nHe proves, that in the former kind, a globe suffers but half the\r\nresistance, which the cylinder, that circumscribes the globe, will\r\ndo, if it move in the direction of its axis[128]. But in the latter\r\nhe proves, that the globe and cylinder are resisted alike[129]. And\r\nin general, that let the shape of bodies be ever so different, yet if\r\nthe greatest sections of the bodies perpendicular to the axis of their\r\nmotion be equal, the bodies will be resisted equally[130].\r\n\r\n20. PURSUANT to the difference found between the resistance of the\r\nglobe and cylinder in rare and uncompressed fluids, our author gives us\r\nthe result of some other inquiries of the same nature. Thus of all the\r\nfrustums of a cone, that can be described upon the same base and with\r\nthe same altitude, he shews how to find that, which of all others will\r\nbe the least resisted, when moving in the direction of its axis[131].\r\nAnd from hence he draws an easy method of altering the figure of any\r\nspheroidical solid, so that its capacity may be enlarged, and yet the\r\nresistance of it diminished[132]: a note which he thinks may not be\r\nuseless to ship-wrights. He concludes with determining the solid, which\r\nwill be resisted the least that is possible, in these discontinued\r\nfluids[133].\r\n\r\n21. THAT I may here be understood by readers unacquainted with\r\nmathematical terms, I shall explain what I mean by a frustum of a cone,\r\nand a spheroidical solid. A cone has been defined above. A frustum is\r\nwhat remains, when part of the cone next the vertex is cut away by a\r\nsection parallel to the base of the cone, as in fig. 86. A spheroid is\r\nproduced from an ellipsis, as a sphere or globe is made from a circle.\r\nIf a circle turn round on its diameter, it describes by its motion a\r\nsphere; so if an ellipsis (which figure has been defined above, and\r\nwill be more fully explained hereafter[134]) be turned round either\r\nupon the longest or shortest line, that can be drawn through the middle\r\nof it, there will be described a kind of oblong or flat sphere, as\r\nin fig. 87. Both these figures are called spheroids, and any solid\r\nresembling these I here call spheroidical.\r\n\r\n22. IF it should be asked, how the method of altering spheroidical\r\nbodies, here mentioned, can contribute to the facilitating a ship’s\r\nmotion, when I just above affirmed, that the figure of bodies, which\r\nmove in a compressed fluid not elastic, has no relation to the\r\naugmentation or diminution of the resistance; the reply is, that what\r\nwas there spoken relates to bodies deep immerged into such fluids, but\r\nnot of those, which swim upon the surface of them; for in this latter\r\ncase the fluid, by the appulse of the anterior parts of the body, is\r\nraised above the level of the surface, and behind the body is sunk\r\nsomewhat below; so that by this inequality in the superficies of\r\nthe fluid, that part of it, which at the head of the body is higher\r\nthan the fluid behind, will resist in some measure after the manner\r\nof discontinued fluids[135], analogous to what was before observed to\r\nhappen in the air through its elasticity, though the body be surrounded\r\non every side by it[136]. And as far as the power of these causes\r\nextends, the figure of the moving body affects its resistance; for\r\nit is evident, that the figure, which presses least directly against\r\nthe parts of the fluid, and so raises least the surface of a fluid\r\nnot elastic, and least compresses one that is elastic, will be least\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\n23. THE way of collecting the difference of the resistance in rare\r\nfluids, which arises from the diversity of figure, is by considering\r\nthe different effect of the particles of the fluid upon the body moving\r\nagainst them, according to the different obliquity of the several\r\nparts of the body upon which they respectively strike; as it is known,\r\nthat any body impinging against a plane obliquely, strikes with a less\r\nforce, than if it fell upon it perpendicularly; and the greater the\r\nobliquity is, the weaker is the force. And it is the same thing, if the\r\nbody be at rest, and the plane move against it[137].\r\n\r\n24. THAT there is no connexion between the figure of a body and its\r\nresistance in compressed fluids, is proved thus. Suppose A B C D (in\r\nfig. 88.) to be a canal, having such a fluid, water for instance,\r\nrunning through it with an equable velocity; and let any body E, by\r\nbeing placed in the axis of the canal, hinder the passage of the water.\r\nIt is evident, that the figure of the fore part of this body will have\r\nlittle influence in obstructing the water’s motion, but the whole\r\nimpediment will arise from the space taken up by the body, by which it\r\ndiminishes the bore of the canal, and straightens the passage of the\r\nwater[138]. But proportional to the obstruction of the water’s motion,\r\nwill be the force of the water upon the body E[139]. Now suppose both\r\norifices of the canal to be closed, and the water in it to remain at\r\nrest; the body E to move, so that the parts of the water may pass by\r\nit with the same degree of velocity, as they did before; it is beyond\r\ncontradiction, that the pressure of the water upon the body, that\r\nis, the resistance it gives to its motion, will remain the same; and\r\ntherefore will have little connexion with the figure of the body[140].\r\n\r\n25. BY a method of reasoning drawn from the same fountain is determined\r\nthe measure of resistance these compressed fluids give to bodies, in\r\nreference to the proportion between the density of the body and that of\r\nthe fluid. This shall be explained particularly in my comment on Sir\r\n~IS. NEWTON~’s mathematical principles of natural philosophy;\r\nbut is not a proper subject to be insisted on farther in this place.\r\n\r\n26. WE have now gone through all the parts of this theory. There\r\nremains nothing more, but in few words to mention the experiments,\r\nwhich our author has made, both with bodies falling perpendicularly\r\nthrough water, and the air[141], and with pendulums[142]: all which\r\nagree with the theory. In the case of falling bodies, the times\r\nof their fall determined by the theory come out the same, as by\r\nobservation, to a surprizing exactness; in the pendulums, the rod, by\r\nwhich the ball of the pendulum hangs, suffers resistance as well as the\r\nball, and the motion of the ball being reciprocal, it communicates such\r\na motion to the fluid, as increases the resistance, but the deviation\r\nfrom the theory is no more, than what may reasonably follow from these\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n27. BY this theory of the resistance of fluids, and these experiments,\r\nour author decides the question so long agitated among natural\r\nphilosophers, whether all space is absolutely full of matter. The\r\nAristotelians and Cartesians both assert this plenitude; the Atomists\r\nhave maintained the contrary. Our author has chose to determine this\r\nquestion by his theory of resistance, as shall be explained in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ~BOOK II.~\r\n  CONCERNING THE\r\n  SYSTEM of the WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nThat the Planets move in a space empty of all sensible matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE now gone through the first part of my design, and have\r\nexplained, as far as the nature of my undertaking would permit, what\r\nSir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has delivered in general concerning the motion\r\nof bodies. It follows now to speak of the discoveries, he has made\r\nin the system of the world; and to shew from him what cause keeps\r\nthe heavenly bodies in their courses. But it will be necessary for\r\nthe use of such, as are not skilled in astronomy, to premise a brief\r\ndescription of the planetary system.\r\n\r\n2. THIS system is disposed in the following manner. In the middle is\r\nplaced the sun. About him six globes continually roll. These are the\r\nprimary planets; that which is nearest to the sun is called Mercury,\r\nthe next Venus, next to this is our earth, the next beyond is Mars,\r\nafter him Jupiter, and the outermost of all Saturn. Besides these there\r\nare discovered in this system ten other bodies, which move about some\r\nof these primary planets in the same manner, as they move round the\r\nsun. These are called secondary planets. The most conspicuous of them\r\nis the moon, which moves round our earth; four bodies move in like\r\nmanner round Jupiter; and five round Saturn. Those which move about\r\nJupiter and Saturn, are usually called satellites; and cannot any of\r\nthem be seen without a telescope. It is not impossible, but there may\r\nbe more secondary planets, beside these; though our instruments have\r\nnot yet discovered any other. This disposition of the planetary or\r\nsolar system is represented in fig. 89.\r\n\r\n3. THE same planet is not always equally distant from the sun. But\r\nthe middle distance of Mercury is between ⅕ and ⅖ of the distance of\r\nthe earth from the sun; Venus is distant from the sun almost ¾ of the\r\ndistance of the earth; the middle distance of Mars is something more\r\nthan half as much again, as the distance of the earth; Jupiter’s\r\nmiddle distance exceeds five times the distance of the earth, by\r\nbetween ⅕ and 1/6 part of this distance; Saturn’s middle distance is\r\nscarce more than 9½ times the distance between the earth and sun; but\r\nthe middle distance between the earth and sun is about 217⅛ times the\r\nsun’s semidiameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n4. ALL these planets move one way, from west to east; and of the\r\nprimary planets the most remote is longest in finishing its course\r\nround the sun. The period of Saturn falls short only sixteen days of 29\r\nyears and a half. The period of Jupiter is twelve years wanting about\r\n50 days. The period of Mars falls short of two years by about 43 days.\r\nThe revolution of the earth constitutes the year. Venus performs her\r\nperiod in about 224½ days, and Mercury in about 88 days.\r\n\r\n5. THE course of each planet lies throughout in one plane or flat\r\nsurface, in which the sun is placed; but they do not all move in the\r\nsame plane, though the different planes, in which they move, cross each\r\nother in very small angles. They all cross each other in lines, which\r\npass through the sun; because the sun lies in the plane of each orbit.\r\nThis inclination of the several orbits to each other is represented in\r\nfig. 90. The line, in which the plane of any orbit crosses the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion, is called the line of the nodes of that orbit.\r\n\r\n6. EACH planet moves round the sun in the line, which we have mentioned\r\nabove[143] under the name of ellipsis; which I shall here shew more\r\nparticularly how to describe. I have there said how it is produced in\r\nthe cone. I shall now shew how to form it upon a plane. Fix upon any\r\nplane two pins, as at A and B in fig. 91. To these tye a string A C B\r\nof any length. Then apply a third pin D so to the string, as to hold\r\nit strained; and in that manner carrying this pin about, the point of\r\nit will describe an ellipsis. If through the points A, B the straight\r\nline E A B F be drawn, to be terminated at the ellipsis in the points\r\nE and F, this is the longest line of any, that can be drawn within the\r\nfigure, and is called the greater axis of the ellipsis. The line G H,\r\ndrawn perpendicular to this axis E F, so as to pass through the middle\r\nof it, is called the lesser axis. The two points A and B are called\r\nfocus’s. Now each planet moves round the sun in a line of this kind, so\r\nthat the sun is found in one focus. Suppose A to be the place of the\r\nsun. Then E is the point, wherein the planet will be nearest of all to\r\nthe sun, and at F it will be most remote. The point E is called the\r\nperihelion of the planet, and F the aphelion. In G and H the planet is\r\nsaid to be in its middle or mean distance; because the distance A G or\r\nA H is truly the middle between A E the least, and A F the greatest\r\ndistance. In fig. 92. is represented how the greater axis of each orbit\r\nis situated in respect of the rest. The proportion between the greatest\r\nand least distances of the planet from the sun is very different in the\r\ndifferent planets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn Saturn the proportion of the greatest distance to the least is\r\nsomething less, than the proportion of 9 to 8, but much nearer to\r\nthis, than to the proportion of 10 to 9. In Jupiter this proportion\r\nis a little greater, than that of 11 to 10. In Mars it exceeds the\r\nproportion of 6 to 5. In the earth it is about the proportion of 30 to\r\n29. In Venus it is near to that of 70 to 69. And in Mercury it comes\r\nnot a great deal short of the proportion of 3 to 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7. EACH of these planets so moves through its ellipsis, that the line\r\ndrawn from the sun to the planet, by accompanying the planet in its\r\nmotion, will describe about the sun equal spaces in equal times, after\r\nthe manner spoke of in the chapter of centripetal forces[144]. There is\r\nalso a certain relation between the greater axis’s of these ellipsis’s,\r\nand the times, in which the planets perform their revolutions through\r\nthem. Which relation may be expressed thus. Let the period of one\r\nplanet be denoted by the letter A, the greater axis of its orbit by\r\nD; let the period of another planet be denoted by B, and the greater\r\naxis of this planet’s orbit by E. Then if C be taken to bear the same\r\nproportion to B, as B bears to A; likewise if F be taken to bear the\r\nsame proportion to E, as E bears to D; and G taken to bear the same\r\nproportion likewise to F, as E bears to D; then A shall bear the same\r\nproportion to C, as D bears to G.\r\n\r\n8. THE secondary planets move round their respective primary, much\r\nin the same manner as the primary do round the sun. But the motions\r\nof these shall be more fully explained hereafter[145]. And there is,\r\nbesides the planets, another sort of bodies, which in all probability\r\nmove round the sun; I mean the comets. The farther description of which\r\nbodies I also leave to the place, where they are to be particularly\r\ntreated on[146].\r\n\r\n9. FAR without this system the fixed stars are placed. These are all so\r\nremote from us, that we seem almost incapable of contriving any means\r\nto estimate their distance. Their number is exceeding great. Besides\r\ntwo or three thousand, which we see with the naked eye, telescopes open\r\nto our view vast numbers; and the farther improved these instruments\r\nare, we still discover more and more. Without doubt these are luminous\r\nglobes, like our sun, and ranged through the wide extent of space; each\r\nof which, it is to be supposed, perform the same office, as our sun,\r\naffording light and heat to certain planets moving about them. But\r\nthese conjectures are not to be pursued in this place.\r\n\r\n10. I SHALL therefore now proceed to the particular design of this\r\nchapter, and shew, that there is no sensible matter lodged in the space\r\nwhere the planets move.\r\n\r\n11. THAT they suffer no sensible resistance from any such matter, is\r\nevident from the agreement between the observations of astronomers in\r\ndifferent ages, with regard to the time, in which the planets have\r\nbeen found to perform their periods. But it was the opinion of DES\r\nCARTES[147], that the planets might be kept in their courses by the\r\nmeans of a fluid matter, which continually circulating round should\r\ncarry the planets along with it. There is one appearance that may seem\r\nto favour this opinion; which is, that the sun turns round its own\r\naxis the same way, as the planets move. The earth also turns round its\r\naxis the same way, as the moon moves round the earth. And the planet\r\nJupiter turns upon its axis the same way, as his satellites revolve\r\nround him. It might therefore be supposed, that if the whole planetary\r\nregion were filled with a fluid matter, the sun, by turning round on\r\nits own axis, might communicate motion first to that part of the fluid,\r\nwhich was contiguous, and by degrees propagate the like motion to the\r\nparts more remote. After the same manner the earth might communicate\r\nmotion to this fluid, to a distance sufficient to carry round the moon,\r\nand Jupiter communicate the like to the distance of its satellites.\r\nSir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has particularly examined what might be\r\nthe result of such a motion as this[148]; and he finds, that the\r\nvelocities, with which the parts of this fluid will move in different\r\ndistances from the center of the motion, will not agree with the motion\r\nobserved in different planets: for instance, that the time of one\r\nintire circulation of the fluid, wherein Jupiter should swim, would\r\nbear a greater proportion to the time of one intire circulation of the\r\nfluid, where the earth is; than the period of Jupiter bears to the\r\nperiod of the earth. But he also proves[149], that the planet cannot\r\ncirculate in such a fluid, so as to keep long in the same course,\r\nunless the planet and the contiguous fluid are of the same density,\r\nand the planet be carried along with the same degree of motion, as\r\nthe fluid. There is also another remark made upon this motion by\r\nour author; which is, that some vivifying force will be continually\r\nnecessary at the center of the motion[150]. The sun in particular, by\r\ncommunicating motion to the ambient fluid, will lose from it self as\r\nmuch motion, as it imparts to the fluid; unless some acting principle\r\nreside in the sun to renew its motion continually. If the fluid be\r\ninfinite, this gradual loss of motion would continue till the whole\r\nshould stop[151]; and if the fluid were limited, this loss of motion\r\nwould continue, till there would remain no swifter a revolution in the\r\nsun, than in the utmost part of the fluid; so that the whole would turn\r\ntogether about the axis of the sun, like one solid globe[152].\r\n\r\n12. IT is farther to be observed, that as the planets do not move in\r\nperfect circles round the sun; there is a greater distance between\r\ntheir orbits in some places, than in others. For instance, the distance\r\nbetween the orbit of Mars and Venus is near half as great again in one\r\npart of their orbits, as in the opposite place. Now here the fluid,\r\nin which the earth should swim, must move with a less rapid motion,\r\nwhere there is this greater interval between the contiguous orbits; but\r\non the contrary, where the space is straitest, the earth moves more\r\nslowly, than where it is widest[153].\r\n\r\n13. FARTHER, if this our globe of earth swam in a fluid of equal\r\ndensity with the earth it self, that is, in a fluid more dense than\r\nwater; all bodies put in motion here upon the earth’s surface must\r\nsuffer a great resistance from it; where as, by Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~’s experiments mentioned in the preceding chapter, bodies,\r\nthat fell perpendicularly down through the air, felt about 1/860 part\r\nonly of the resistance, which bodies suffered that fell in like manner\r\nthrough water.\r\n\r\n14. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ applies these experiments yet farther,\r\nand examines by them the general question concerning the absolute\r\nplenitude of space. According to the Aristotelians, all space was\r\nfull without any the least vacuities whatever. DESCARTES embraced the\r\nsame opinion, and therefore supposed a subtile fluid matter, which\r\nshould pervade all bodies, and adequately fill up their pores. The\r\nAtomical philosophers, who suppose all bodies both fluid and solid to\r\nbe composed of very minute but solid atoms, assert that no fluid, how\r\nsubtile soever the particles or atoms whereof it is composed should be,\r\ncan ever cause an absolute plenitude; because it is impossible that\r\nany body can pass through the fluid without putting the particles of\r\nit into such a motion, as to separate them, at least in part, from one\r\nanother, and so perpetually to cause small vacuities; by which these\r\nAtomists endeavour to prove, that a vacuum, or some space empty of\r\nall matter, is absolutely necessary to be in nature. Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ objects against the filling of space with such a subtile\r\nfluid, that all bodies in motion must be unmeasurably resisted by a\r\nfluid so dense, as absolutely to fill up all the space, through which\r\nit is spread. And lest it should be thought, that this objection might\r\nbe evaded by ascribing to this fluid such very minute and smooth parts,\r\nas might remove all adhesion or friction between them, whereby all\r\nresistance would be lost, which this fluid might otherwise give to\r\nbodies moving in it; Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ proves, in the manner\r\nabove related, that fluids resist from the power of inactivity of their\r\nparticles; and that water and the air resist almost entirely on this\r\naccount: so that in this subtile fluid, however minute and lubricated\r\nthe particles, which compose it, might be; yet if the whole fluid was\r\nas dense as water, it would resist very near as much as water does; and\r\nwhereas such a fluid, whose parts are absolutely close together without\r\nany intervening spaces, must be a great deal more dense than water,\r\nit must resist more than water in proportion to its greater density;\r\nunless we will suppose the matter, of which this fluid is composed, not\r\nto be endued with the same degree of inactivity as other matter. But if\r\nyou deprive any substance of the property so universally belonging to\r\nall other matter, without impropriety of speech it can scarce be called\r\nby this name.\r\n\r\n15. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ made also an experiment to try\r\nin particular, whether the internal parts of bodies suffered any\r\nresistance. And the result did indeed appear to favour some small\r\ndegree of resistance; but so very little, as to leave it doubtful,\r\nwhether the effect did not arise from some other latent cause[154].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nConcerning the cause, which keeps in motion the primary planets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the planets move in a void space and are free from resistance;\r\nthey, like all other bodies, when once in motion, would move on in a\r\nstraight line without end, if left to themselves. And it is now to be\r\nexplained what kind of action upon them carries them round the sun.\r\nHere I shall treat of the primary planets only, and discourse of the\r\nsecondary apart in the next chapter. It has been just now declared,\r\nthat these primary planets move so about the sun, that a line extended\r\nfrom the sun to the planet, will, by accompanying the planet in its\r\nmotion, pass over equal spaces in equal portions of time[155]. And\r\nthis one property in the motion of the planets proves, that they are\r\ncontinually acted on by a power directed perpetually to the sun as a\r\ncenter. This therefore is one property of the cause, which keeps the\r\nplanets in their courses, that it is a centripetal power, whose center\r\nis the sun.\r\n\r\n2. AGAIN, in the chapter upon centripetal forces[156] it was observ’d,\r\nthat if the strength of the centripetal power was suitably accommodated\r\nevery where to the motion of any body round a center, the body might\r\nbe carried in any bent line whatever, whose concavity should be every\r\nwhere turned towards the center of the force. It was farther remarked,\r\nthat the strength of the centripetal force, in each place, was to be\r\ncollected from the nature of the line, wherein the body moved[157].\r\nNow since each planet moves in an ellipsis, and the sun is placed in\r\none focus; Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ deduces from hence, that the\r\nstrength of this power is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of\r\nthe distance from the sun. This is deduced from the properties, which\r\nthe geometers have discovered in the ellipsis. The process of the\r\nreasoning is not proper to be enlarged upon here; but I shall endeavour\r\nto explain what is meant by the reciprocal duplicate proportion. Each\r\nof the terms reciprocal proportion, and duplicate proportion, has been\r\nalready defined[158]. Their sense when thus united is as follows.\r\nSuppose the planet moved in the orbit A B C (in fig. 93.) about the sun\r\nin S. Then, when it is said, that the centripetal power, which acts on\r\nthe planet in A, bears to the power acting on it in B a proportion,\r\nwhich is the reciprocal of the duplicate proportion of the distance S\r\nA to the distance S B; it is meant that the power in A bears to the\r\npower in B the duplicate of the proportion of the distance S B to the\r\ndistance S A. The reciprocal duplicate proportion may be explained\r\nalso by numbers as follows. Suppose several distances to bear to each\r\nother proportions expressed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; that is, let\r\nthe second distance be double the first, the third be three times,\r\nthe fourth four times, and the fifth five times as great as the\r\nfirst. Multiply each of these numbers by it self, and 1 multiplied by\r\n1 produces still 1, 2 multiplied by 2 produces 4, 3 by 3 makes 9, 4\r\nby 4 makes 16, and 5 by 5 gives 25. This being done, the fractions ¼,\r\n1/9, 1/16, 1/25, will respectively express the proportion, which the\r\ncentripetal power in each of the following distances bears to the power\r\nat the first distance: for in the second distance, which is double the\r\nfirst, the centripetal power will be one fourth part only of the power\r\nat the first distance; at the third distance the power will be one\r\nninth part only of the first power; at the fourth distance, the power\r\nwill be but one sixteenth part of the first; and at the fifth distance,\r\none twenty fifth part of the first power.\r\n\r\n3. THUS is found the proportion, in which this centripetal power\r\ndecreases, as the distance from the sun increases, within the compass\r\nof one planet’s motion. How it comes to pass, that the planet can be\r\ncarried about the sun by this centripetal power in a continual round,\r\nsometimes rising from the sun, then descending again as low, and from\r\nthence be carried up again as far remote as before, alternately rising\r\nand falling without end; appears from what has been written above\r\nconcerning centripetal forces: for the orbits of the planets resemble\r\nin shape the curve line proposed in § 17 of the chapter on these\r\nforces[159].\r\n\r\n4. BUT farther, in order to know whether this centripetal force\r\nextends in the same proportion throughout, and consequently whether\r\nall the planets are influenced by the very same power, our author\r\nproceeds thus. He inquires what relation there ought to be between\r\nthe periods of the different planets, provided they were acted\r\nupon by the same power decreasing throughout in the forementioned\r\nproportion; and he finds, that the period of each in this case would\r\nhave that very relation to the greater axis of its orbit, as I have\r\ndeclared above[160] to be found in the planets by the observations\r\nof astronomers. And this puts it beyond question, that the different\r\nplanets are pressed towards the sun, in the same proportion to their\r\ndistances, as one planet is in its several distances. And thence in the\r\nlast place it is justly concluded, that there is such a power acting\r\ntowards the sun in the foresaid proportion at all distances from it.\r\n\r\n5. THIS power, when referred to the planets, our author calls\r\ncentripetal, when to the sun attractive; he gives it likewise the\r\nname of gravity, because he finds it to be of the same nature with\r\nthat power of gravity, which is observed in our earth, as will appear\r\nhereafter[161]. By all these names he designs only to signify a power\r\nendued with the properties before mentioned; but by no means would he\r\nhave it understood, as if these names referred any way to the cause of\r\nit. In particular in one place where he uses the name of attraction, he\r\ncautions us expressly against implying any thing but a power directing\r\na body to a center without any reference to the cause of it, whether\r\nresiding in that center, or arising from any external impulse[162].\r\n\r\n6. BUT now, in these demonstrations some very minute inequalities in\r\nthe motion of the planets are neglected; which is done with a great\r\ndeal of judgment; for whatever be their cause, the effects are very\r\ninconsiderable, they being so exceeding small, that some astronomers\r\nhave thought fit wholly to pass them by[163]. However the excellency\r\nof this philosophy, when in the hands of so great a geometer as our\r\nauthor, is such, that it is able to trace the least variations of\r\nthings up to their causes. The only inequalities, which have been\r\nobserved common to all the planets, are the motion of the aphelion and\r\nthe nodes. The transverse axis of each orbit does not always remain\r\nfixed, but moves about the sun with a very slow progressive motion:\r\nnor do the planets keep constantly the same plane, but change them,\r\nand the lines in which those planes intersect each other by insensible\r\ndegrees. The first of these inequalities, which is the motion of the\r\naphelion, may be accounted for, by supposing the gravitation of the\r\nplanets towards the sun to differ a little from the forementioned\r\nreciprocal duplicate proportion of the distances; but the second,\r\nwhich is the motion of the nodes, cannot be accounted for by any\r\npower directed towards the sun; for no such can give the planet any\r\nlateral impulse to divert it from the plane of its motion into any new\r\nplane, but of necessity must be derived from some other center. Where\r\nthat power is lodged, remains to be discovered. Now it is proved, as\r\nshall be explained in the following chapter, that the three primary\r\nplanets Saturn, Jupiter, and the earth, which have satellites revolving\r\nabout them, are endued with a power of causing bodies, in particular\r\nthose satellites, to gravitate towards them with a force, which is\r\nreciprocally in the duplicate proportion of their distances; and the\r\nplanets are in all respects, in which they come under our examination,\r\nso similar and alike, that there is no reason to question, but they\r\nhave all the same property. Though it be sufficient for the present\r\npurpose to have it proved of Jupiter and Saturn only; for these\r\nplanets contain much greater quantities of matter than the rest, and\r\nproportionally exceed the others in power[164]. But the influence of\r\nthese two planets being allowed, it is evident how the planets come to\r\nshift continually their planes: for each of the planets moving in a\r\ndifferent plane, the action of Jupiter and Saturn upon the rest will\r\nbe oblique to the planes of their motion; and therefore will gradually\r\ndraw them into new ones. The same action of these two planets upon\r\nthe rest will cause likewise a progressive motion of the aphelion; so\r\nthat there will be no necessity of having recourse to the other cause\r\nfor this motion, which was before hinted at[165]; viz, the gravitation\r\nof the planets towards the sun differing from the exact reciprocal\r\nduplicate proportion of the distances. And in the last place, the\r\naction of Jupiter and Saturn upon each other will produce in their\r\nmotions the same inequalities, as their joint action produces in the\r\nrest. All this is effected in the same manner, as the sun produces the\r\nsame kind of inequalities and many others in the motion of the moon and\r\nthe other secondary planets; and therefore will be best apprehended by\r\nwhat shall be said in the next chapter. Those other irregularities in\r\nthe motion of the secondary planets have place likewise here; but are\r\ntoo minute to be observable: because they are produced and rectified\r\nalternately, for the most part in the time of a single revolution;\r\nwhereas the motion of the aphelion and nodes, which continually\r\nincrease, become sensible in a long series of years. Yet some of these\r\nother inequalities are discernible in Jupiter and Saturn, in Saturn\r\nchiefly; for when Jupiter, who moves faster than Saturn, approaches\r\nnear to a conjunction with him, his action upon Saturn will a little\r\nretard the motion of that planet, and by the reciprocal action of\r\nSaturn he will himself be accelerated. After conjunction, Jupiter will\r\nagain accelerate Saturn, and be likewise retarded in the same degree,\r\nas before the first was retarded and the latter accelerated. Whatever\r\ninequalities besides are produced in the motion of Saturn by the action\r\nof Jupiter upon that planet, will be sufficiently rectified, by placing\r\nthe focus of Saturn’s ellipsis, which should otherwise be in the sun,\r\nin the common center of gravity of the sun and Jupiter. And all the\r\ninequalities in the motion of Jupiter, caused by Saturn’s action upon\r\nhim, are much less considerable than the irregularities of Saturn’s\r\nmotion[166].\r\n\r\n7. THIS one principle therefore of the planets having a power, as well\r\nas the sun, to cause bodies to gravitate towards them, which is proved\r\nby the motion of the secondary planets to obtain in fact, explains\r\nall the irregularities relating to the planets ever observed by\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\n8. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ after this proceeds to make an\r\nimprovement in astronomy by applying this theory to the farther\r\ncorrection of their motions. For as we have here observed the planets\r\nto possess a principle of gravitation, as well as the sun; so it will\r\nbe explained at large hereafter, that the third law of motion, which\r\nmakes action and reaction equal, is to be applied in this case[167];\r\nand that the sun does not only attract each planet, but is it self\r\nalso attracted by them; the force, wherewith the planet is acted on,\r\nbearing to the force, wherewith the sun it self is acted on at the same\r\ntime, the proportion, which the quantity of matter in the sun bears\r\nto the quantity of matter in the planet. From the action between the\r\nsun and planet being thus mutual Sir ISAAC NEWTON proves that the sun\r\nand planet will describe about their common center of gravity similar\r\nellipsis’s; and then that the transverse axis of the ellipsis described\r\nthus about the moveable sun, will bear to the transverse axis of the\r\nellipsis, which would be described about the sun at rest in the same\r\ntime, the same proportion as the quantity of solid matter in the sun\r\nand planet together bears to the first of two mean proportionals\r\nbetween this quantity and the quantity of matter in the sun only[168].\r\n\r\n9. ABOVE, where I shewed how to find a cube, that should bear any\r\nproportion to another cube[169], the lines F T and T S are two mean\r\nproportionals between E F and F G; and counting from E F, F T is called\r\nthe first, and F S the second of those means. In numbers these mean\r\nproportionals are thus found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuppose A and B two numbers, and it be required to find C the first,\r\nand D the second of the two mean proportionals between them. First\r\nmultiply A by it self, and the product multiply by B; then C will be\r\nthe number which in arithmetic is called the cubic root of this last\r\nproduct; that is, the number C being multiplied by it self, and the\r\nproduct again multiplied by the same number C, will produce the product\r\nabove mentioned. In like manner D is the cubic root of the product\r\nof B multiplied by it self, and the produce of that multiplication\r\nmultiplied again by A.\r\n\r\n10. IT will be asked, perhaps, how this correction can be admitted,\r\nwhen the cause of the motions of the planets was before found by\r\nsupposing the sun the center of the power, which acted upon them: for\r\naccording to the present correction this power appears rather to be\r\ndirected to their common center of gravity. But whereas the sun was\r\nat first concluded to be the center, to which the power acting on the\r\nplanets was directed, because the spaces described round the sun in\r\nequal times were found to be equal; so Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~\r\nproves, that if the sun and planet move round their common center of\r\ngravity, yet to an eye placed in the planet, the spaces, which will\r\nappear to be described about the sun, will have the same relation to\r\nthe times of their description, as the real spaces would have, if the\r\nsun were at rest[170]. I farther asserted, that, supposing the planets\r\nto move round the sun at rest, and to be attracted by a power, which\r\nevery where should act with degrees of strength reciprocally in the\r\nduplicate proportion of the distances; then the periods of the planets\r\nmust observe the same relation to their distances, as astronomers find\r\nthem to do. But here it must not be supposed, that the observations of\r\nastronomers absolutely agree without any the least difference; and the\r\npresent correction will not cause a deviation from any one astronomer’s\r\nobservations, so much as they differ from one another. For in Jupiter,\r\nwhere this correction is greatest, it hardly amounts to the 3000^{th}\r\npart of the whole axis.\r\n\r\n11. UPON this head I think it not improper to mention a reflection made\r\nby our excellent author upon these small inequalities in the planets\r\nmotions; which contains under it a very strong philosophical argument\r\nagainst the eternity of the world. It is this, that these inequalities\r\nmust continually increase by slow degrees, till they render at length\r\nthe present frame of nature unfit for the purposes, it now serves[171].\r\nAnd a more convincing proof cannot be desired against the present\r\nconstitution’s having existed from eternity than this, that a certain\r\nperiod of years will bring it to an end. I am aware this thought of\r\nour author has been represented even as impious, and as no less than\r\ncasting a reflection upon the wisdom of the author of nature, for\r\nframing a perishable work. But I think so bold an assertion ought to\r\nhave been made with singular caution. For if this remark upon the\r\nincreasing irregularities of the heavenly motions be true in fact,\r\nas it really is, the imputation must return upon the asserter, that\r\nthis does detract from the divine wisdom. Certainly we cannot pretend\r\nto know all the omniscient Creator’s purposes in making this world,\r\nand therefore cannot undertake to determine how long he designed it\r\nshould last. And it is sufficient, if it endure the time intended by\r\nthe author. The body of every animal shews the unlimited wisdom of its\r\nauthor no less, nay in many respects more, than the larger frame of\r\nnature; and yet we see, they are all designed to last but a small space\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n12. THERE need nothing more be said of the primary planets; the motions\r\nof the secondary shall be next considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOf the motion of the MOON and the other SECONDARY PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE excellency of this philosophy sufficiently appears from its\r\nextending in the manner, which has been related, to the minutest\r\ncircumstances of the primary planets motions; which nevertheless\r\nbears no proportion to the vast success of it in the motions of the\r\nsecondary; for it not only accounts for all the irregularities, by\r\nwhich their motions were known to be disturbed, but has discovered\r\nothers so complicated, that astronomers were never able to distinguish\r\nthem, and reduce them under proper heads; but these were only to be\r\nfound out from their causes, which this philosophy has brought to\r\nlight, and has shewn the dependence of these inequalities upon such\r\ncauses in so perfect a manner, that we not only learn from thence in\r\ngeneral, what those inequalities are, but are able to compute the\r\ndegree of them. Of this Sir ~IS. NEWTON~ has given several\r\nspecimens, and has moreover found means to reduce the moon’s motion so\r\ncompletely to rule, that he has framed a theory, from which the place\r\nof that planet may at all times be computed, very nearly or altogether\r\nas exactly, as the places of the primary planets themselves, which is\r\nmuch beyond what the greatest astronomers could ever effect.\r\n\r\n2. THE first thing demonstrated of these secondary planets is, that\r\nthey are drawn towards their respective primary in the same manner\r\nas the primary planets are attracted by the sun. That each secondary\r\nplanet is kept in its orbit by a power pointed towards the center of\r\nthe primary planet, about which the secondary revolves; and that the\r\npower, by which the secondaries of the same primary are influenced,\r\nbears the same relation to the distance from the primary, as the power,\r\nby which the primary planets are guided, does in regard to the distance\r\nfrom the sun[172]. This is proved in the satellites of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, because they move in circles, as far as we can observe, about\r\ntheir respective primary with an equable course, the respective primary\r\nbeing the center of each orbit: and by comparing the times, in which\r\nthe different satellites of the same primary perform their periods,\r\nthey are found to observe the same relation to the distances from\r\ntheir primary, as the primary planets observe in respect of their mean\r\ndistances from the sun[173]. Here these bodies moving in circles with\r\nan equable motion, each satellite passes over equal parts of its orbit\r\nin equal portions of time; consequently the line drawn from the center\r\nof the orbit, that is, from the primary planet, to the satellite, will\r\npass over equal spaces along with the satellite in equal portions of\r\ntime; which proves the power, by which each satellite is held in its\r\norbit, to be pointed towards the primary as a center[174]. It is also\r\nmanifest that the centripetal power, which carries a body in a circle\r\nconcentrical with the power, acts upon the body at all times with the\r\nsame strength. But Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ demonstrates that, when\r\nbodies are carried in different circles by centripetal powers directed\r\nto the centers of those circles, then, the degrees of strength of\r\nthose powers are to be compared by considering the relation between\r\nthe times, in which the bodies perform their periods through those\r\ncircles[175]; and in particular he shews, that if the periodical times\r\nbear that relation, which I have just now asserted the satellites\r\nof the same primary to observe; then the centripetal powers are\r\nreciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the semidiameters of the\r\ncircles, or in that proportion to the distances of the bodies from the\r\ncenters[176]. Hence it follows that in the planets Jupiter and Saturn,\r\nthe centripetal power in each decreases with the increase of distance,\r\nin the same proportion as the centripetal power appertaining to the\r\nsun decreases with the increase of distance. I do not here mean that\r\nthis proportion of the centripetal powers holds between the power of\r\nJupiter at any distance compared with the power of Saturn at any other\r\ndistance; but only in the change of strength of the power belonging to\r\nthe same planet at different distances from him. Moreover what is here\r\ndiscovered of the planets Jupiter and Saturn by means of the different\r\nsatellites, which revolve round each of them, appears in the earth by\r\nthe moon alone; because she is found to move round the earth in an\r\nellipsis after the same manner as the primary planets do about the sun;\r\nexcepting only some small irregularities in her motion, the cause of\r\nwhich will be particularly explained in what follows, whereby it will\r\nappear, that they are no objection against the earth’s acting on the\r\nmoon in the same manner as the sun acts on the primary planets; that\r\nis, as the other primary planets Jupiter and Saturn act upon their\r\nsatellites. Certainly since these irregularities can be otherwise\r\naccounted for, we ought not to depart from that rule of induction so\r\nnecessary in philosophy, that to like bodies like properties are to\r\nbe attributed, where no reason to the contrary appears. We cannot\r\ntherefore but ascribe to the earth the same kind of action upon the\r\nmoon, as the other primary planets Jupiter and Saturn have upon their\r\nsatellites; which is known to be very exactly in the proportion\r\nassigned by the method of comparing the periodical times and distances\r\nof all the satellites which move about the same planet; this abundantly\r\ncompensating our not being near enough to observe the exact figure of\r\ntheir orbits. For if the little deviation of the moon’s orbit orbit\r\nfrom a true permanent ellipsis arose from the action of the earth upon\r\nthe moon not being in the exact reciprocal duplicate proportion of the\r\ndistance, were another moon to revolve about the earth, the proportion\r\nbetween the periodical times of this new moon, and the present,\r\nwould discover the deviation from the mentioned proportion much more\r\nmanifestly.\r\n\r\n3. BY the number of satellites, which move round Jupiter and Saturn,\r\nthe power of each of these planets is measured in a great diversity\r\nof distance; for the distance of the outermost satellite in each of\r\nthese planets exceeds several times the distance of the innermost. In\r\nJupiter the astronomers have usually placed the innermost satellite\r\nat a distance from the center of that planet equal to about 5⅔ of\r\nthe semidiameters of Jupiter’s body, and this satellite performs its\r\nrevolution in about 1 day 18½ hours. The next satellite, which revolves\r\nround Jupiter in about 3 days 13⅕ hours, they place at the distance\r\nfrom Jupiter of about 9 of that planet’s semidiameters. To the third\r\nsatellite, which performs its period nearly in 7 days 3¾ hours, they\r\nassign the distance of about 14⅖ semidiameters. But the outermost\r\nsatellite they remove to 25⅓ semidiameters, and this satellite makes\r\nits period in about 16 days 16½ hours[177]. In Saturn there is still\r\na greater diversity in the distance of the several satellites. By the\r\nobservations of the late ~CASSINI~, a celebrated astronomer\r\nin France, who first discovered all these satellites, except one known\r\nbefore, the innermost is distant about 4½ of Saturn’s semidiameters\r\nfrom his center, and revolves round in about 1 day 21⅓ hours. The next\r\nsatellite is distant about 5¾ semidiameters, and makes its period in\r\nabout 2 days 17⅔ hours. The third is removed to the distance of about\r\n8 semidiameters, and performs its revolution in near 4 days 12½ hours.\r\nThe fourth satellite discovered first by the great HUYGENS, is near\r\n18⅔ semidiameters, and moves round Saturn in about 15 days 22⅔ hours.\r\nThe outermost is distant 56 semidiameters, and makes its revolution in\r\nabout 79 days 7⅘ hours[178]. Besides these satellites, there belongs\r\nto the planet Saturn another body of a very singular kind. This is a\r\nshining, broad, and flat ring, which encompasses the planet round.\r\nThe diameter of the outermost verge of this ring is more than double\r\nthe diameter of Saturn. ~HUYGENS~, who first described this\r\nring, makes the whole diameter thereof to bear to the diameter of\r\nSaturn the proportion of 9 to 4. The late reverend Mr. POUND makes the\r\nproportion something greater, viz. that of 7 to 3. The distances of the\r\nsatellites of this planet Saturn are compared by ~CASSINI~ to\r\nthe diameter of the ring. His numbers I have reduced to those above,\r\naccording to Mr. POUND’s proportion between the diameters of Saturn and\r\nof his ring. As this ring appears to adhere no where to Saturn, so the\r\ndistance of Saturn from the inner edge of the ring seems rather greater\r\nthan the breadth of the ring. The distances, which have here been\r\ngiven, of the several satellites, both for Jupiter and Saturn, may be\r\nmore depended on in relation to the proportion, which those belonging\r\nto the same primary planet bear one to another, than in respect to the\r\nvery numbers, that have been here set down, by reason of the difficulty\r\nthere is in measuring to the greatest exactness the diameters of the\r\nprimary planets; as will be explained hereafter, when we come to treat\r\nof telescopes[179]. By the observations of the forementioned Mr. POUND,\r\nin Jupiter the distance of the innermost satellite should rather be\r\nabout 6 semidiameters, of the second 9-½, of the third 15, and of\r\nthe outermost 26⅔[180]; and in Saturn the distance of the innermost\r\nsatellite 4 semidiameters, of the next 6¼, of the third 8¾, of the\r\nfourth 20⅓, and of the fifth 59[181]. However the proportion between\r\nthe distances of the satellites in the same primary is the only thing\r\nnecessary to the point we are here upon.\r\n\r\n4. BUT moreover the force, wherewith the earth acts in different\r\ndistances, is confirmed from the following consideration, yet more\r\nexpresly than by the preceding analogical reasoning. It will appear,\r\nthat if the power of the earth, by which it retains the moon in her\r\norbit, be supposed to act at all distances between the earth and moon,\r\naccording to the forementioned rule; this power will be sufficient to\r\nproduce upon bodies, near the surface of the earth, all the effects\r\nascribed to the principle of gravity. This is discovered by the\r\nfollowing method. Let A (in fig. 94.) represent the earth, B the moon,\r\nB C D the moon’s orbit, which differs little from a circle, of which A\r\nis the center. If the moon in B were left to it self to move with the\r\nvelocity, it has in the point B, it would leave the orbit, and proceed\r\nright forward in the line B E, which touches the orbit in B. Suppose\r\nthe moon would upon this condition move from B to E in the space of\r\none minute of time. By the action of the earth upon the moon, whereby\r\nit is retained in its orbit, the moon will really be found at the end\r\nof this minute in the point F, from whence a straight line drawn to A\r\nshall make the space B F A in the circle equal to the triangular space\r\nB E A; so that the moon in the time wherein it would have moved from\r\nB to E, if left to it self, has been impelled towards the earth from\r\nE to F. And when the time of the moon’s passing from B to F is small,\r\nas here it is only one minute, the distance between E and F scarce\r\ndiffers from the space, through which the moon would descend in the\r\nsame time, if it were to fall directly down from B toward A without any\r\nother motion. A B the distance of the earth and moon is about 60 of the\r\nearth’s semidiameters, and the moon completes her revolution round the\r\nearth in about 27 days 7 hours and 43 minutes: therefore the space E F\r\nwill here be found by computation to be about 16⅛ feet. Consequently,\r\nif the power, by which the moon is retained in its orbit, be near the\r\nsurface of the earth greater, than at the distance of the moon in the\r\nduplicate proportion of that distance; the number of feet, a body would\r\ndescend near the surface of the earth by the action of this power upon\r\nit in one minute of time, would be equal to 16⅛ multiplied twice into\r\nthe number 60, that is, equal to 58050. But how fast bodies fall near\r\nthe surface of the earth may be known by the pendulum[182]; and by the\r\nexactest experiments they are found to descend the space of 16⅛ feet in\r\na second of time; and the spaces described by falling bodies being in\r\nthe duplicate proportion of the times of their fall[183], the number of\r\nfeet, a body would describe in its fall near the surface of the earth\r\nin one minute of time, will be equal to 16⅛ twice multiplied by 60, the\r\nsame as would be caused by the power which acts upon the moon.\r\n\r\n5. IN this computation the earth is supposed to be at rest, whereas\r\nit would have been more exact to have supposed it to move, as well\r\nas the moon, about their common center of gravity; as will easily be\r\nunderstood, by what has been said in the preceding chapter, where it\r\nwas shewn, that the sun is subjected to the like motion about the\r\ncommon center of gravity of it self and the planets. The action of\r\nthe sun upon the moon, which is to be explain’d in what follows, is\r\nlikewise here neglected: and Sir ISAAC NEWTON shews, if you take in\r\nboth these considerations, the present computation will best agree\r\nto a somewhat greater distance of the moon and earth, viz. to 60½\r\nsemidiameters of the earth, which distance is more conformable to\r\nastronomical observations.\r\n\r\n6. THESE computations afford an additional proof, that the action of\r\nthe earth observes the same proportion to the distance, which is here\r\ncontended for. Before I said, it was reasonable to conclude so by\r\ninduction from the planets Jupiter and Saturn; because they act in\r\nthat manner. But now the same thing will be evident by drawing no other\r\nconsequence from what is seen in those planets, than that the power,\r\nby which the primary planets act on their secondary, is extended from\r\nthe primary through the whole interval between, so that it would act in\r\nevery part of the intermediate space. In Jupiter and Saturn this power\r\nis so far from being confined to a small extent of distance, that it\r\nnot only reaches to several satellites at very different distances, but\r\nalso from one planet to the other, nay even through the whole planetary\r\nsystem[184]. Consequently there is no appearance of reason, why this\r\npower should not act at all distances, even at the very surfaces of\r\nthese planets as well as farther off. But from hence it follows, that\r\nthe power, which retains the moon in her orbit, is the same, as causes\r\nbodies near the surface of the earth to gravitate. For since the\r\npower, by which the earth acts on the moon, will cause bodies near the\r\nsurface of the earth to descend with all the velocity they are found\r\nto do, it is certain no other power can act upon them besides; because\r\nif it did, they must of necessity descend swifter. Now from all this\r\nit is at length very evident, that the power in the earth, which we\r\ncall gravity, extends up to the moon, and decreases in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the increase of the distance from the earth.\r\n\r\n7. THIS finishes the discoveries made in the action of the primary\r\nplanets upon their secondary. The next thing to be shewn is, that the\r\nsun acts upon them likewise: for this purpose it is to be observed,\r\nthat if to the motion of the satellite, whereby it would be carried\r\nround its primary at rest, be superadded the same motion both in\r\nregard to velocity and direction, as the primary it self has, it will\r\ndescribe about the primary the same orbit, with as great regularity,\r\nas if the primary was indeed at rest. The cause of this is that law\r\nof motion, which makes a body near the surface of the earth, when let\r\nfall, to descend perpendicularly, though the earth be in so swift a\r\nmotion, that if the falling body did not partake of it, its descent\r\nwould be remarkably oblique; and that a body projected describes in\r\nthe most regular manner the same parabola, whether projected in the\r\ndirection, in which the earth moves, or in the opposite direction, if\r\nthe projecting force be the same[185]. From this we learn, that if the\r\nsatellite moved about its primary with perfect regularity, besides its\r\nmotion about the primary, it would participate of all the motion of its\r\nprimary; have the same progressive velocity, with which the primary\r\nis carried about the sun; and be impelled with the same velocity as\r\nthe primary towards the sun, in a direction parallel to that impulse\r\nof its primary. And on the contrary, the want of either of these,\r\nin particular of the impulse towards the sun, will occasion great\r\ninequalities in the motion of the secondary planet. The inequalities,\r\nwhich would arise from the absence of this impulse towards the sun are\r\nso great, that by the regularity, which appears in the motion of the\r\nsecondary planets, it is proved, that the sun communicates, the same\r\nvelocity to them by its action, as it gives to their primary at the\r\nsame distance. For Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ informs us, that upon\r\nexamination he found, that if any of the satellites of Jupiter were\r\nattracted by the sun more or less, than Jupiter himself at the same\r\ndistance, the orbit of that satellite, instead of being concentrical to\r\nJupiter, must have its center at a greater or less distance, than the\r\ncenter of Jupiter from the sun, nearly in the subduplicate proportion\r\nof the difference between the sun’s action upon the satellite, and upon\r\nJupiter; and therefore if any satellite were attracted by the sun but\r\n1/1000 part more or less, than Jupiter is at the same distance, the\r\ncenter of the orbit of that satellite would be distant from the center\r\nof Jupiter no less than a fifth part of the distance of the outermost\r\nsatellite from Jupiter[186]; which is almost the whole distance of the\r\ninnermost satellite. By the like argument the satellites of Saturn\r\ngravitate towards the sun, as much as Saturn it self at the same\r\ndistance; and the moon as much as the earth.\r\n\r\n8. THUS is proved, that the sun acts upon the secondary planets, as\r\nmuch as upon the primary at the same distance: but it was found in the\r\nlast chapter, that the action of the sun upon bodies is reciprocally\r\nin the duplicate proportion of the distance; therefore the secondary\r\nplanets being sometimes nearer to the sun than the primary, and\r\nsometimes more remote, they are not alway acted upon in the same degree\r\nwith their primary, but when nearer to the sun, are attracted more,\r\nand when farther distant, are attracted less. Hence arise various\r\ninequalities in the motion of the secondary planets[187].\r\n\r\n9. SOME of these inequalities would take place, though the moon, if\r\nundisturbed by the sun, would have moved in a circle concentrical\r\nto the earth, and in the plane of the earth’s motion; others depend\r\non the elliptical figure, and the oblique situation of the moon’s\r\norbit. One of the first kind is, that the moon is caused so to move,\r\nas not to describe equal spaces in equal times, but is continually\r\naccelerated, as she passes from the quarter to the new or full, and is\r\nretarded again by the like degrees in returning from the new and full\r\nto the next quarter. Here we consider not so much the absolute, as the\r\napparent motion of the moon in respect to us.\r\n\r\n10. THE principles of astronomy teach how to distinguish these two\r\nmotions. Let S (in fig. 95.) represent the sun, A the earth moving\r\nin its orbit B C, D E F G the moon’s orbit, the place of the moon H.\r\nSuppose the earth to have moved from A to I. Because it has been shewn,\r\nthat the moon partakes of all the progressive motion of the earth;\r\nand likewise that the sun attracts both the earth and moon equally,\r\nwhen they are at the same distance from it, or that the mean action\r\nof the sun upon the moon is equal to its action upon the earth: we\r\nmust therefore consider the earth as carrying about with it the moon’s\r\norbit; so that when the earth is removed from A to I, the moon’s orbit\r\nshall likewise be removed from its former situation into that denoted\r\nby K L M N. But now the earth being in I, if the moon were found in O,\r\nso that O I should be parallel to H A, though the moon would really\r\nhave moved from H to O, yet it would not have appeared to a spectator\r\nupon the earth to have moved at all, because the earth has moved as\r\nmuch it self; so that the moon would still appear in the same place\r\nwith respect to the fixed stars. But if the moon be observed in P, it\r\nwill then appear to have moved, its apparent motion being measured\r\nby the angle under O I P. And if the angle under P I S be less than\r\nthe angle under H A S, the moon will have approached nearer to its\r\nconjunction with the sun.\r\n\r\n11. TO come now to the explication of the mentioned inequality in\r\nthe moon’s motion: let S (in fig. 96.) represent the sun, A the\r\nearth, B C D E the moon’s orbit, C the place of the moon, when in\r\nthe latter quarter. Here it will be nearly at the same distance from\r\nthe sun, as the earth is. In this case therefore they will both be\r\nequally attracted, the earth in the direction A S, and the moon in\r\nthe direction C S. Whence as the earth in moving round the sun is\r\ncontinually descending toward it, so the moon in this situation must in\r\nany equal portion of time descend as much; and therefore the position\r\nof the line A C in respect of A S, and the change, which the moon’s\r\nmotion produces in the angle under C A S, will not be altered by the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n12. BUT now as soon as ever the moon is advanced from the quarter\r\ntoward the new or conjunction, suppose to G, the action of the sun upon\r\nit will have a different effect. Here, were the sun’s action upon the\r\nmoon to be applied in the direction G H parallel to A S, if its action\r\non the moon were equal to its action on the earth, no change would be\r\nwrought by the sun on the apparent motion of the moon round the earth.\r\nBut the moon receiving a greater impulse in G than the earth receives\r\nin A, were the sun to act in the direction G H, yet it would accelerate\r\nthe description of the space D A G, and cause the angle under G A D to\r\ndecrease faster, than otherwise it would. The sun’s action will have\r\nthis effect upon account of the obliquity of its direction to that,\r\nin which the earth attracts the moon. For the moon by this means is\r\ndrawn by two forces oblique to each other, one drawing from G toward\r\nA, the other from G toward H, therefore the moon must necessarily be\r\nimpelled toward D. Again, because the sun does not act in the direction\r\nG H parallel to S A, but in the direction G S oblique to it, the sun’s\r\naction on the moon will by reason of this obliquity farther contribute\r\nto the moon’s acceleration. Suppose the earth in any short space of\r\ntime would have moved from A to I, if not attracted by the sun; the\r\npoint I being in the straight line C E, which touches the earth’s orbit\r\nin A. Suppose the moon in the same time would have moved in her orbit\r\nfrom G to K, and besides have partook of all the progressive motion of\r\nthe earth. Then if K L be drawn parallel to A I, and taken equal to it,\r\nthe moon, if not attracted by the sun, would be found in L. But the\r\nearth by the sun’s action is removed from I. Suppose it were moved down\r\nto M in the line I M N parallel to S A, and if the moon were attracted\r\nbut as much, and in the same direction, as the earth is here supposed\r\nto be attracted, so as to have descended during the same time in the\r\nline L O, parallel also to A S, down as far as P, till L P were equal\r\nto I M; the angle under P M N would be equal to that under L I N, that\r\nis, the moon will appear advanced no farther forward, than if neither\r\nit nor the earth had been subject to the sun’s action. But this is upon\r\nthe supposition, that the action of the sun upon the moon and earth\r\nwere equal; whereas the moon being acted upon more than the earth,\r\ndid the sun’s action draw the moon in the line L O parallel to A S,\r\nit would draw it down so far as to make L P greater than I M; whereby\r\nthe angle under P M N will be rendred less, than that under L I N. But\r\nmoreover, as the sun draws the earth in a direction oblique to I N, the\r\nearth will be found in its orbit somewhat short of the point M; however\r\nthe moon is attracted by the sun still more out of the line L O, than\r\nthe earth is out of the line I N; therefore this obliquity of the sun’s\r\naction will yet farther diminish the angle under P M N.\r\n\r\n13. THUS the moon at the point G receives an impulse from the sun,\r\nwhereby her motion is accelerated. And the sun producing this effect in\r\nevery place between the quarter and the conjunction, the moon will move\r\nfrom the quarter with a motion continually more and more accelerated;\r\nand therefore by acquiring from time to time additional degrees of\r\nvelocity in its orbit, the spaces, which are described in equal times\r\nby the line drawn from the earth to the moon, will not be every where\r\nequal, but those toward the conjunction will be greater, than those\r\ntoward the quarter. But now in the moon’s passage from the conjunction\r\nD to the next quarter the sun’s action will again retard the moon, till\r\nat the next quarter in E it be restored to the first velocity, which it\r\nhad in C.\r\n\r\n14. AGAIN as the moon moves from E to the full or opposition to the\r\nsun in B, it is again accelerated, the deficiency of the sun’s action\r\nupon the moon, from what it has upon the earth, producing here the same\r\neffect as before the excess of its action. Consider the moon in Q,\r\nmoving from E towards B. Here if the moon were attracted by the sun in\r\na direction parallel to A S, yet being acted on less than the earth,\r\nas the earth descends toward the sun, the moon will in some measure be\r\nleft behind. Therefore Q F being drawn parallel to S B, a spectator\r\non the earth would see the moon move, as if attracted from the point\r\nQ in the direction Q F with a degree of force equal to that, whereby\r\nthe sun’s action on the moon falls short of its action on the earth.\r\nBut the obliquity of the sun’s action has also here an effect. In the\r\ntime the earth would have moved from A to I without the influence of\r\nthe sun, let the moon have moved in its orbit from Q to R. Drawing\r\ntherefore R T parallel to A I, and equal to the same, for the like\r\nreason as before, the moon by the motion of its orbit, if not at all\r\nattracted by the sun, must be found in T; and therefore, if attracted\r\nin a direction parallel to S A, would be in the line T V parallel to\r\nA S; suppose in W. But the moon in Q being farther off the sun than\r\nthe earth, it will be less attracted, that is, T W will be less than\r\nI M, and if the line S M be prolonged toward X, the angle under X M\r\nW will be less than that under X I T. Thus by the sun’s action the\r\nmoon’s passage from the quarter to the full would be accelerated, if\r\nthe sun were to act on the earth and moon in a direction parallel to A\r\nS: and the obliquity of the sun’s action will still more increase this\r\nacceleration. For the action of the sun on the moon is oblique to the\r\nline S A the whole time of the moon’s passage from Q to T, and will\r\ncarry the moon out of the line T V toward the earth. Here I suppose the\r\ntime of the moon’s passage from Q to T so short, that it shall not pass\r\nbeyond the line S A. The earth also will come a little short of the\r\nline I N, as was said before. From these causes the angle under X M W\r\nwill be still farther lessened.\r\n\r\n15. THE moon in passing from the opposition B to the next quarter will\r\nbe retarded again by the same degrees, as it is accelerated before\r\nits appulse to the opposition. Because this action of the sun, which\r\nin the moon’s passage from the quarter to the opposition causes it\r\nto be extraordinarily accelerated, and diminishes the angle, which\r\nmeasures its distance from the opposition; will make the moon slacken\r\nits pace afterwards, and retard the augmentation of the same angle in\r\nits passage from the opposition to the following quarter; that is, will\r\nprevent that angle from increasing so fast, as otherwise it would. And\r\nthus the moon, by the sun’s action upon it, is twice accelerated and\r\ntwice restored to its first velocity, every circuit it makes round the\r\nearth. This inequality of the moon’s motion about the earth is called\r\nby astronomers its variation.\r\n\r\n16. THE next effect of the sun upon the moon is, that it gives the\r\norbit of the moon in the quarters a greater degree of curvature,\r\nthan it would receive from the action of the earth alone; and on the\r\ncontrary in the conjunction and opposition the orbit is less inflected.\r\n\r\n17. WHEN the moon is in conjunction with the sun in the point D, the\r\nsun attracting the moon more forcibly than it does the earth, the\r\nmoon by that means is impelled less toward the earth, than otherwise\r\nit would be, and so the orbit is less incurvated; for the power, by\r\nwhich the moon is impelled toward the earth, being that, by which it is\r\ninflected from a rectilinear course, the less that power is, the less\r\nit will be inflected. Again, when the moon is in the opposition in B,\r\nfarther removed from the sun than the earth is; it follows then, though\r\nthe earth and moon are both continually descending to the sun, that\r\nis, are drawn by the sun toward it self out of the place they would\r\notherwise move into, yet the moon descends with less velocity than\r\nthe earth; insomuch that the moon in any given space of time from its\r\npassing the point of opposition will have less approached the earth,\r\nthan otherwise it would have done, that is, its orbit in respect of\r\nthe earth will approach nearer to a straight line. In the last place,\r\nwhen the moon is in the quarter in F, and equally distant from the\r\nsun as the earth, we observed before, that the earth and moon would\r\ndescend with equal pace toward the sun, so as to make no change by\r\nthat descent in the angle under F A S; but the length of the line F\r\nA must of necessity be shortned. Therefore the moon in moving from F\r\ntoward the conjunction with the sun will be impelled more toward the\r\nearth by the sun’s action, than it would have been by the earth alone,\r\nif neither the earth nor moon had been acted on by the sun; so that\r\nby this additional impulse the orbit is rendred more curve, than it\r\nwould otherwise be. The same effect will also be produced in the other\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n18. ANOTHER effect of the sun’s action, consequent upon this we have\r\nnow explained, is, that though the moon undisturbed by the sun might\r\nmove in a circle having the earth for its center; by the sun’s action,\r\nif the earth were to be in the very middle or center of the moon’s\r\norbit, yet the moon would be nearer the earth at the new and full, than\r\nin the quarters. In this probably will at first appear some difficulty,\r\nthat the moon should come nearest to the earth, where it is least\r\nattracted to it, and be farthest off when most attracted. Which yet\r\nwill appear evidently to follow from that very cause, by considering\r\nwhat was last shewn, that the orbit of the moon in the conjunction\r\nand opposition is rendred less curve; for the less curve the orbit of\r\nthe moon is, the less will the moon have descended from the place it\r\nwould move into, without the action of the earth. Now if the moon were\r\nto move from any place without farther disturbance from that action,\r\nsince it would proceed in the line, which would touch its orbit in that\r\nplace, it would recede continually from the earth; and therefore if\r\nthe power of the earth upon the moon, be sufficient to retain it at the\r\nsame distance, this diminution of that power will cause the distance\r\nto increase, though in a less degree. But on the other hand in the\r\nquarters, the moon, being pressed more towards the earth than by the\r\nearth’s single action, will be made to approach it; so that in passing\r\nfrom the conjunction or opposition to the quarters the moon ascends\r\nfrom the earth, and in passing from the quarters to the conjunction and\r\nopposition it descends again, becoming nearer in these last mentioned\r\nplaces than in the other.\r\n\r\n19. ALL these forementioned inequalities are of different degrees,\r\naccording as the sun is more or less distant from the earth; greater\r\nwhen the earth is nearest the sun, and less when it is farthest off.\r\nFor in the quarters, the nearer the moon is to the sun, the greater is\r\nthe addition to the earth’s action upon it by the power of the sun; and\r\nin the conjunction and opposition, the difference between the sun’s\r\naction upon the earth and upon the moon is likewise so much the greater.\r\n\r\n20. This difference in the distance between the earth and the sun\r\nproduces a farther effect upon the moon’s motion; causing the orbit to\r\ndilate when less remote from the sun, and become greater, than when at\r\na farther distance. For it is proved by Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~, that the\r\naction of the sun, by which it diminishes the earth’s power over the\r\nmoon, in the conjunction or opposition, is about twice as great, as\r\nthe addition to the earth’s action by the sun in the quarters[188]; so\r\nthat upon the whole, the power of the earth upon the moon is diminished\r\nby the sun, and therefore is most diminished, when the action of the\r\nsun is strongest: but as the earth by its approach to the sun has its\r\ninfluence lessened, the moon being less attracted will gradually recede\r\nfrom the earth; and as the earth in its recess from the sun recovers by\r\ndegrees its former power, the orbit of the moon must again contract.\r\nTwo consequences follow from hence: the moon will be most remote from\r\nthe earth, when the earth is nearest the sun; and also will take up a\r\nlonger time in performing its revolution through the dilated orbit,\r\nthan through the more contracted.\r\n\r\n21. THESE irregularities the sun would produce in the moon, if the\r\nmoon, without being acted on unequally by the sun, would describe a\r\nperfect circle about the earth, and in the plane of the earth’s motion;\r\nbut though neither of these suppositions obtain in the motion of the\r\nmoon, yet the forementioned inequalities will take place, only with\r\nsome difference in respect to the degree of them; but the moon by not\r\nmoving in this manner is subject to some other inequalities also.\r\nFor as the moon describes, instead of a circle concentrical to the\r\nearth, an ellipsis, with the earth in one focus, that ellipsis will be\r\nsubjected to various changes. It can neither preserve constantly the\r\nsame position, nor yet the same figure; and because the plane of this\r\nellipsis is not the same with that of the earth’s orbit, the situation\r\nof the plane, wherein the moon moves, will continually change; neither\r\nthe line in which it intersects the plane of the earth’s orbit, nor the\r\ninclination of the planes to each other, will remain for any time the\r\nsame. All these alterations offer themselves now to be explained.\r\n\r\n22. I SHALL first consider the changes which are made in the plane\r\nof the moon’s orbit. The moon not moving in the same plane with the\r\nearth, the sun is seldom in the plane of the moon’s orbit, viz. only\r\nwhen the line made by the common intersection of the two planes, if\r\nproduced, will pass through the sun, as is represented in fig. 97.\r\nwhere S denotes the sun; T the earth; A T B the earth’s orbit described\r\nupon the plane of this scheme; C D E F the moon’s orbit, the part C\r\nD E being raised above, and the part C F E depressed under the plane\r\nof this scheme. Here the line C E, in which the plane of this scheme,\r\nthat is, the plane of the earth’s orbit and the plane of the moon’s\r\norbit intersect each other, being continued passes through the sun in\r\nS. When this happens, the action of the sun is directed in the plane of\r\nthe moon’s orbit, and cannot draw the moon out of this plane, as will\r\nevidently appear to any one that shall consider the present scheme: for\r\nsuppose the moon in G, and let a straight line be drawn from G to S,\r\nthe sun draws the moon in the direction of this line from G toward S:\r\nbut this line lies in the plane of the orbit; and if it be prolonged\r\nfrom S beyond G, the continuation of it will lie on the plane C D E;\r\nfor the plane itself, if sufficiently extended, will pass through the\r\nsun. But in other cases the obliquity of the sun’s action to the plane\r\nof the orbit will cause this plane continually to change.\r\n\r\n23. SUPPOSE in the first place, the line, in which the two planes\r\nintersect each other, to be perpendicular to the line which joins the\r\nearth and sun. Let T (in fig. 98, 99, 100, 101.) represent the earth; S\r\nthe sun; the plane of this scheme the plane of the earth’s motion, in\r\nwhich both the sun and earth are placed. Let A C be perpendicular to\r\nS T, which joins the earth and sun; and let the line A C be that, in\r\nwhich the plane of the moon’s orbit intersects the plane of the earth’s\r\nmotion. To the center T describe in the plane of the earth’s motion\r\nthe circle A B C D. And in the plane of the moon’s orbit describe the\r\ncircle A E C F, one half of which A E C will be elevated above the\r\nplane of this scheme, the other half A F C as much depressed below it.\r\n\r\n24. NOW suppose the moon to set forth from the point A (in fig. 98.) in\r\nthe direction of the plane A E C. Here she will be continually drawn\r\nout of this plane by the action of the sun: for this plane A E C, if\r\nextended, will not pass through the sun, but above it; so that the sun,\r\nby drawing the moon directly toward it self, will force it continually\r\nmore and more from that plane towards the plane of the earth’s motion,\r\nin which it self is; causing it to describe the line A K G H I, which\r\nwill be convex to the plane A E C, and concave to the plane of the\r\nearth’s motion. But here this power of the sun, which is said to draw\r\nthe moon toward the plane of the earth’s motion, must be understood\r\nprincipally of so much only of the sun’s action upon the moon, as\r\nit exceeds the action of the same upon the earth. For suppose the\r\npreceding figure to be viewed by the eye, placed in the plane of that\r\nscheme, and in the line C T A on the side of A, the plane A B C D will\r\nappear as the straight line D T B, (in fig. 102.) and the plane A E C\r\nF as another straight line F E; and the curve line A K G H I under the\r\nform of the line T K G H I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow it is plain, that the earth and moon being both attracted by the\r\nsun, if the sun’s action upon both was equally strong, the earth T,\r\nand with it the plane A E C F or line F T E in this scheme, would be\r\ncarried toward the sun with as great a pace as the moon, and therefore\r\nthe moon not drawn out of it by the sun’s action, excepting only from\r\nthe small obliquity of the direction of this action upon the moon\r\nto that of the sun’s action upon the earth, which arises from the\r\nmoon’s being out of the plane of the earth’s motion, and is not very\r\nconsiderable; but the action of the sun upon the moon being greater\r\nthan upon the earth, all the time the moon is nearer to the sun than\r\nthe earth is, it will be drawn from the plane A E C or the line T E by\r\nthat excess, and made to describe the curve line A G I or T G I. But it\r\nis the custom of astronomers, instead of considering the moon as moving\r\nin such a curve line, to refer its motion continually to the plane,\r\nwhich touches the true line wherein it moves, at the point where at\r\nany time the moon is. Thus when the moon is in the point A, its motion\r\nis considered as being in the plane A E C, in whose direction it then\r\nessaies to move; and when in the point K (in fig. 99.) its motion is\r\nreferred to the plane, which passes through the earth, and touches the\r\nline A K G H I in the point K. Thus the moon in passing from A to I\r\nwill continually change the plane of her motion. In what manner this\r\nchange proceeds, I shall now particularly explain.\r\n\r\n25. LET the plane, which touches the line A K I in the point K (in fig.\r\n99.) intersect the plane of the earth’s orbit in the line L T M. Then,\r\nbecause the line A K I is concave to the plane A B C, it falls wholly\r\nbetween that plane, and the plane which touches it in K; so that the\r\nplane M K L will cut the plane A E C, before it meets with the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion; suppose in the line Y T, and the point A will fall\r\nbetween K and L. With a semidiameter equal to T Y or T L describe the\r\nsemicircle L Y M. Now to a spectator on the earth the moon, when in A,\r\nwill appear to move in the circle A E C F, and, when in K, will appear\r\nto be moving in the semicircle L Y M. The earth’s motion is performed\r\nin the plane of this scheme, and to a spectator on the earth the sun\r\nwill appear always moving in that plane. We may therefore refer the\r\napparent motion of the sun to the circle A B C D, described in this\r\nplane about the earth. But the points where this circle, in which the\r\nsun seems to move, intersects the circle in which the moon is seen at\r\nany time to move, are called the nodes of the moon’s orbit at that\r\ntime. When the moon is seen moving in the circle A E C D, the points A\r\nand C are the nodes of the orbit; when she appears in the semicircle\r\nL Y M, then L and M are the nodes. Now here it appears, from what has\r\nbeen said, that while the moon has moved from A to K, one of the nodes\r\nhas been carried from A to L, and the other as much from C to M. But\r\nthe motion from A to L, and from C to M, is backward in regard to the\r\nmotion of the moon, which is the other way from A to K, and from thence\r\ntoward C.\r\n\r\n26. FARTHER the angle, which the plane, wherein the moon at any time\r\nappears, makes with the plane of the earth’s motion, is called the\r\ninclination of the moon’s orbit at that time. And I shall now proceed\r\nto shew, that this inclination of the orbit, when the moon is in K, is\r\nless than when she was in A; or, that the plane L Y M, which touches\r\nthe line of the moon’s motion in K, makes a less angle with the plane\r\nof the earth’s motion or with the circle A B C D, than the plane A E\r\nC makes with the same. The semicircle L Y M intersects the semicircle\r\nA E C in Y; and the arch A Y is less than L Y, and both together less\r\nthan half a circle. But it is demonstrated by the writers on that part\r\nof astronomy, which is called the doctrine of the sphere, that when a\r\ntriangle is made, as here, by three arches of circles A L, A Y, and Y\r\nL, the angle under Y A B without the triangle is greater than the angle\r\nunder Y L A within, if the two arches A Y, Y L taken together do not\r\namount to a semicircle; if the two arches make a complete semicircle,\r\nthe two angles will be equal; but if the two arches taken together\r\nexceed a semicircle, the inner angle under Y L A is greater than the\r\nother[189]. Here therefore the two arches A Y and L Y together being\r\nless than a semicircle, the angle under A L Y is less, than the angle\r\nunder B A E. But from the doctrine of the sphere it is also evident,\r\nthat the angle under A L Y is equal to that, in which the plane of the\r\ncircle L Y K M, that is, the plane which touches the line A K G H I in\r\nK, is inclined to the plane of the earth’s motion A B C; and the angle\r\nunder B A E is equal to that, in which the plane A E C is inclined to\r\nthe same plane. Therefore the inclination of the former plane is less\r\nthan the inclination of the latter.\r\n\r\n27. SUPPOSE now the moon to be advanced to the point G (in fig. 100.)\r\nand in this point to be distant from its node a quarter part of the\r\nwhole circle; or in other words, to be in the midway between its two\r\nnodes. And in this case the nodes will have receded yet more, and the\r\ninclination of the orbit be still more diminished: for suppose the\r\nline A K G H I to be touched in the point G by a plane passing through\r\nthe earth T: let the intersection of this plane with the plane of the\r\nearth’s motion be the line W T O, and the line T P its intersection\r\nwith the plane L K M. In this plane let the circle N G O be described\r\nwith the semidiameter T P or N T cutting the other circle L K M in P.\r\nNow the line A K G I is convex to the plane L K M, which touches it in\r\nK; and therefore the plane N G O, which touches it in G, will intersect\r\nthe other touching plane between G and K; that is, the point P will\r\nfall between those two points, and the plane continued to the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion will pass beyond L; so that the points N and O, or\r\nthe places of the nodes, when the moon is in G, will be farther from A\r\nand C than L and M, that is, will have moved farther backward. Besides,\r\nthe inclination of the plane N G O to the plane of the earth’s motion A\r\nB C is less, than the inclination of the plane L K M to the same; for\r\nhere also the two arches L P and N P taken together are less than a\r\nsemicircle, each of these arches being less than a quarter of a circle;\r\nas appears, because G N, the distance of the moon in G from its node N,\r\nis here supposed to be a quarter part of a circle.\r\n\r\n28. AFTER the moon is passed beyond G, the case is altered; for then\r\nthese arches will be greater than quarters of the circle, by which\r\nmeans the inclination will be again increased, tho’ the nodes still go\r\non to move the same way. Suppose the moon in H, (in fig. 101.) and that\r\nthe plane, which touches the line A K G I in H, intersects the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion in the line Q T R, and the plane N G O in the line T\r\nV, and besides that the circle Q H R be described in that plane; then,\r\nfor the same reason as before, the point V will fall between H and G,\r\nand the plane R V Q will pass beyond the last plane O V N, causing\r\nthe points Q and R to fall farther from A and C than N and O. But the\r\narches N V, V Q are each greater than a quarter of a circle, N V the\r\nleast of them being greater than G N, which is a quarter of a circle;\r\nand therefore the two arches N V and V Q together exceed a semicircle;\r\nconsequently the angle under B Q V will be greater, than that under B N\r\nV.\r\n\r\n29. IN the last place, when the moon is by this attraction of the sun,\r\ndrawn at length into the plane of the earth’s motion, the node will\r\nhave receded yet more, and the inclination be so much increased, as\r\nto become somewhat more than at first: for the line A K G H I being\r\nconvex to all the planes, which touch it, the part H I will wholly fall\r\nbetween the plane Q V R and the plane A B C; so that the point I will\r\nfall between B and R; and drawing I T W, the point W will be farther\r\nremov’d from A than Q. But it is evident, that the plane, which passes\r\nthrough the earth T, and touches the line A G I in the point I, will\r\ncut the plane of the earth’s motion A B C D in the line I T W, and\r\nbe inclined to the same in the angle under H I B; so that the node,\r\nwhich was first in A, after having passed into L, N and Q, comes at\r\nlast into the point W; as the node which was at first in C has passed\r\nsuccessively from thence through the points M, O and R to I: but the\r\nangle under H I B, which is now the inclination of the orbit to the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, is manifestly not less than the angle under E C\r\nB or E A B, but rather something greater.\r\n\r\n30. THUS the moon in the case before us, while it passes from the\r\nplane of the earth’s motion in the quarter, till it comes again into\r\nthe same plane, has the nodes of its orbit continually moved backward,\r\nand the inclination of its orbit is at first diminished, viz. till it\r\ncomes to G in fig. 100, which is near to its conjunction with the sun,\r\nbut afterwards is increased again almost by the same degrees, till\r\nupon the moon’s arrival again to the plane of the earth’s motion, the\r\ninclination of the orbit is restored to something more than its first\r\nmagnitude, though the difference is not very great, because the points\r\nI and C are not far distant from each other[190].\r\n\r\n31. AFTER the same manner, if the moon had departed from the quarter in\r\nC, it should have described the curve line C X W (in fig. 98.) between\r\nthe planes A F C and A D C, which would be convex to the former of\r\nthose planes, and concave to the latter; so that, here also, the nodes\r\nshould continually recede, and the inclination of the orbit gradually\r\ndiminish more and more, till the moon arrived near its opposition to\r\nthe sun in X; but from that time the inclination should again increase,\r\ntill it became a little greater than at first. This will easily\r\nappear, by considering, that as the action of the sun upon the moon,\r\nby exceeding its action upon the earth, drew it out of the plane A E\r\nC towards the sun, while the moon passed from A to I; so, during its\r\npassage from C to W, the moon being all that time farther from the sun\r\nthan the earth, it will be attracted less; and the earth, together with\r\nthe plane A E C F, will as it were be drawn from the moon, in such\r\nsort, that the path the moon describes shall appear from the earth, as\r\nit did in the former case by the moon’s being drawn away.\r\n\r\n32. THESE are the changes, which the nodes and the inclination of the\r\nmoon’s orbit undergo, when the nodes are in the quarters; but when the\r\nnodes by their motion, and the motion of the sun together, come to\r\nbe situated between the quarter and conjunction or opposition, their\r\nmotion and the change made in the inclination of the orbit are somewhat\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n33. LET A G C H (in fig. 103.) be a circle described in the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion, having the earth in T for its center. Let the\r\npoint opposite to the sun be A, and the point G a fourth part of the\r\ncircle distant from A. Let the nodes of the moon’s orbit be situated\r\nin the line B T D, and B the node, falling between A, the place where\r\nthe moon would be in the full, and G the place where the moon would\r\nbe in the quarter. Suppose B E D F to be the plane, in which the moon\r\nessays to move, when it proceeds from the point B. Because the moon\r\nin B is more distant from the sun than the earth, it shall be less\r\nattracted by the sun, and shall not descend towards the sun so fast\r\nas the earth: consequently it shall quit the plane B E D F, which we\r\nsuppose to accompany the earth, and describe the line B I K convex\r\nthereto, till such time as it comes to the point K, where it will be in\r\nthe quarter: but from thenceforth being more attracted than the earth,\r\nthe moon shall change its course, and the following part of the path\r\nit describes shall be concave to the plane B E D or B G D, and shall\r\ncontinue concave to the plane B G D, till it crosses that plane in L,\r\njust as in the preceding case. Now I say, while the moon is passing\r\nfrom B to K, the nodes, contrary to what was found in the foregoing\r\ncase, will proceed forward, or move the same way with the moon[191];\r\nand at the same time the inclination of the orbit will increase[192].\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n34. WHEN the moon is in the point I, let the plane M I N pass through\r\nthe earth T, and touch the path of the moon in I, cutting the plane of\r\nthe earth’s motion, in the line M T N, and the plane B E D in the line\r\nT O. Because the line B I K is convex to the plane B E D, which touches\r\nit in B, the plane N I M must cross the plane D E B, before it meets\r\nthe plane C G B; and therefore the point M will fall from B towards G,\r\nand the node of the moon’s orbit being translated from B to M is moved\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n35. I SAY farther, the angle under O M G, which the plane M O N makes\r\nwith the plane B G C, is greater than the angle under O B G, which\r\nthe plane B O D makes with the same. This appears from what has been\r\nalready explained; because the arches B O, O M are each less than the\r\nquarter of a circle, and therefore taken both together are less than a\r\nsemicircle.\r\n\r\n36. AGAIN, when the moon is come to the point K in its quarter, the\r\nnodes will be advanced yet farther forward, and the inclination of the\r\norbit also more augmented. Hitherto the moon’s motion has been referred\r\nto the plane, which passing through the earth touches the path of the\r\nmoon in the point, where the moon is, according to what was asserted at\r\nthe beginning of this discourse upon the nodes, that it is the custom\r\nof astronomers so to do. But here in the point K no such plane can be\r\nfound; on the contrary, seeing the line of the moon’s motion on one\r\nside the point K is convex to the plane B E D, and on the other side\r\nconcave to the same, no plane can pass through the points T and K but\r\nwill cut the line B K L in that point. Therefore instead of such a\r\ntouching plane, we must here make use of what is equivalent, the plane\r\nP K Q, with which the line B K L shall make a less angle than with any\r\nother plane; for this plane does as it were touch the line B K in the\r\npoint K, since it so cuts it, that no other plane can be drawn so,\r\nas to pass between the line B K and the plane P K Q. But now it is\r\nevident, that the point P, or the node, is removed from M towards G,\r\nthat is, has moved yet farther forward; and it is likewise as manifest,\r\nthat the angle under K P G, or the inclination of the moon’s orbit in\r\nthe point K, is greater than the angle under I M G, for the reason so\r\noften assigned.\r\n\r\n37. AFTER the moon has passed the quarter, the path of the moon being\r\nconcave to the plane A G C H, the nodes, as in the preceding case,\r\nshall recede, till the moon arrives at the point L; which shews, that\r\nconsidering the whole time of the moon’s passing from B to L, at the\r\nend of that time the nodes shall be found to have receded, or to be\r\nplaced backwarder, when the moon is in L, than when it was in B. For\r\nthe moon takes a longer time in passing from K to L, than in passing\r\nfrom B to K; and therefore the nodes continue to recede a longer time,\r\nthan they moved forwards; so that their recess must surmount their\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n38. IN the same manner, while the moon is in its passage from K to L,\r\nthe inclination of the orbit shall diminish, till the moon comes to\r\nthe point, in which it is one quarter part of a circle distant from\r\nits node; suppose in the point R; and from that time the inclination\r\nshall again increase. Since therefore the inclination of the orbit\r\nincreases, while the moon is passing from B to K, and diminishes itself\r\nagain only, while the moon is passing from K to R, and then augments\r\nagain, till the moon arrive in L; while the moon is passing from B to\r\nL, the inclination of the orbit is much more increased than diminished,\r\nand will be distinguishably greater, when the moon is come to L, than\r\nwhen it set out from B.\r\n\r\n39. IN like manner, while the moon is passing from L on the other side\r\nthe plane A G C H, the node shall advance forward, as long as the moon\r\nis between the point L and the next quarter; but afterwards it shall\r\nrecede, till the moon come to pass the plane A G C H again in the point\r\nV, between B and A: and because the time between the moon’s passing\r\nfrom L to the next quarter is less, than the time between that quarter\r\nand the moon’s coming to the point V, the node shall have more receded\r\nthan advanced; so that the point V will be nearer to A, than L is to C.\r\nSo also the inclination of the orbit, when the moon is in V, will be\r\ngreater, than when the moon was at L; for this inclination increases\r\nall the time the moon is between L and the next quarter; it decreases\r\nonly while the moon is passing from this quarter to the mid way between\r\nthe two nodes, and from thence increases again during the whole passage\r\nthrough the other half of the way to the next node.\r\n\r\n40. THUS we have traced the moon from her node in the quarter, and\r\nshewn, that at every period of the moon the nodes will have receded,\r\nand thereby will have approached toward a conjunction with the sun.\r\nBut this conjunction will be much forwarded by the visible motion of\r\nthe sun itself. In the last scheme the sun will appear to move from\r\nS toward W. Suppose it appeared to have moved from S to W, while the\r\nmoon’s node has receded from B to V, then drawing the line W T X,\r\nthe arch V X will represent the distance of the line drawn between\r\nthe nodes from the sun, when the moon is in V; whereas the arch B A\r\nrepresented that distance, when the moon was in B. This visible motion\r\nof the sun is much greater, than that of the node; for the sun appears\r\nto revolve quite round each year, and the node is near 19 years in\r\nmaking one revolution. We have also seen, that when the node was in\r\nthe quadrature, the inclination of the moon’s orbit decreased, till\r\nthe moon came to the conjunction, or opposition, according to which\r\nnode it set out from; but that afterwards it again increased, till it\r\nbecame at the next node rather greater than at the former. When the\r\nnode is once removed from the quarter nearer to a conjunction with the\r\nsun, the inclination of the moon’s orbit, when the moon comes into the\r\nnode, is more sensibly greater, than it was in the node preceding; the\r\ninclination of the orbit by this means more and more increasing till\r\nthe node comes into conjunction with the sun; at which time it has\r\nbeen shewn above, that the sun has no power to change the plane of the\r\nmoon’s motion; and consequently has no effect either on the nodes, or\r\non the inclination of the orbit.\r\n\r\n41. AS soon as the nodes, by the action of the sun, are got out of\r\nconjunction toward the other quarters, they begin again to recede as\r\nbefore; but the inclination of the orbit in the appulse of the moon\r\nto each succeeding node is less than at the preceding, till the nodes\r\ncome again into the quarters. This will appear as follows. Let A (in\r\nfig. 104.) represent one of the moon’s nodes placed between the point\r\nof opposition B and the quarter C. Let the plane A D E pass through\r\nthe earth T, and touch the path of the moon in A. Let the line A F G H\r\nbe the path of the moon in her passage from A to H, where she crosses\r\nagain the plane of the earth’s motion. This line will be convex toward\r\nthe plane A D E, till the moon comes to G, where she is in the quarter;\r\nand after this, between G and H, the same line will be concave toward\r\nthis plane. All the time this line is convex toward the plane A D\r\nE, the nodes will recede; and on the contrary proceed, while it is\r\nconcave to that plane. All this will easily be conceived from what has\r\nbeen before so largely explained. But the moon is longer in passing\r\nfrom A to G, than from G to H; therefore the nodes recede a longer\r\ntime, than they proceed; consequently upon the whole, when the moon is\r\narrived at H, the nodes will have receded, that is, the point H will\r\nfall between B and E. The inclination of the orbit will decrease, till\r\nthe moon is arrived to the point F, in the middle between A and H.\r\nThrough the passage between F and G the inclination will increase, but\r\ndecrease again in the remaining part of the passage from G to H, and\r\nconsequently at H must be less than at A. The like effects, both in\r\nrespect to the nodes and inclination of the orbit, will take place in\r\nthe following passage of the moon on the other side of the plane A B E\r\nC, from H, till it comes over that plane again in I.\r\n\r\n42. THUS the inclination of the orbit is greatest, when the line drawn\r\nbetween the moon’s nodes will pass through the sun; and least, when\r\nthis line lies in the quarters, especially if the moon at the same time\r\nbe in conjunction with the sun, or in the opposition. In the first of\r\nthese cases the nodes have no motion, in all others, the nodes will\r\neach month have receded: and this regressive motion will be greatest,\r\nwhen the nodes are in the quarters; for in that case the nodes have\r\nno progressive motion during the whole month, but in all other cases\r\nthe nodes do at some times proceed forward, viz. whenever the moon is\r\nbetween either quarter, and the node which is less distant from that\r\nquarter than a fourth part of a circle.\r\n\r\n43. IT now remains only to explain the irregularities in the moon’s\r\nmotion, which follow from the elliptical figure of the orbit. By\r\nwhat has been said at the beginning of this chapter it appears, that\r\nthe power of the earth on the moon acts in the reciprocal duplicate\r\nproportion of the distance: therefore the moon, if undisturbed by\r\nthe sun, would move round the earth in a true ellipsis, and the line\r\ndrawn from the earth to the moon would pass over equal spaces in equal\r\nportions of time. That this description of the spaces is altered by\r\nthe sun, has been already declared. It has also been shown, that the\r\nfigure of the orbit is changed each month; that the moon is nearer the\r\nearth at the new and full, and more remote in the quarters, than it\r\nwould be without the sun. Now we must pass by these monthly changes,\r\nand consider the effect, which the sun will have in the different\r\nsituations of the axis of the orbit in respect of that luminary.\r\n\r\n44. THE action of the sun varies the force, wherewith the moon is drawn\r\ntoward the earth; in the quarters the force of the earth is directly\r\nincreased by the sun; at the new and full the same is diminished; and\r\nin the intermediate places the influence of the earth is sometimes\r\naided, and sometimes lessened by the sun. In these intermediate\r\nplaces between the quarters and the conjunction or opposition, the\r\nsun’s action is so oblique to the action of the earth on the moon, as\r\nto produce that alternate acceleration and retardment of the moon’s\r\nmotion, which I observed above to be stiled the variation. But besides\r\nthis effect, the power, by which the earth attracts the moon toward\r\nitself, will not be at full liberty to act with the same force, as if\r\nthe sun acted not at all on the moon. And this effect of the sun’s\r\naction, whereby it corroborates or weakens the action of the earth, is\r\nhere only to be considered. And by this influence of the sun it comes\r\nto pass, that the power, by which the moon is impelled toward the\r\nearth, is not perfectly in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the\r\ndistance. Consequently the moon will not describe a perfect ellipsis.\r\nOne particular, wherein the moon’s orbit will differ from an ellipsis,\r\nconsists in the places, where the motion of the moon is perpendicular\r\nto the line drawn from itself to the earth. In an ellipsis, after the\r\nmoon should have set out in the direction perpendicular to this line\r\ndrawn from itself to the earth, and at its greatest distance from the\r\nearth, its motion would again become perpendicular to this line drawn\r\nbetween itself and the earth, and the moon be at its nearest distance\r\nfrom the earth, when it should have performed half its period; after\r\nperforming the other half of its period its motion would again become\r\nperpendicular to the forementioned line, and the moon return into\r\nthe place whence it set out, and have recovered again its greatest\r\ndistance. But the moon in its real motion, after setting out as before,\r\nsometimes makes more than half a revolution, before its motion comes\r\nagain to be perpendicular to the line drawn from itself to the earth,\r\nand the moon is at its nearest distance; and then performs more than\r\nanother half of an intire revolution before its motion can a second\r\ntime recover its perpendicular direction to the line drawn from the\r\nmoon to the earth, and the moon arrive again to its greatest distance\r\nfrom the earth. At other times the moon will descend to its nearest\r\ndistance, before it has made half a revolution, and recover again\r\nits greatest distance, before it has made an intire revolution. The\r\nplace, where the moon is at its greatest distance from the earth, is\r\ncalled the moon’s apogeon, and the place of the least distance the\r\nperigeon. This change of the place, where the moon successively comes\r\nto its greatest distance from the earth, is called the motion of the\r\napogeon. In what manner the sun causes the apogeon to move, I shall now\r\nendeavour to explain.\r\n\r\n45. OUR author shews, that if the moon were attracted toward the\r\nearth by a composition of two powers, one of which were reciprocally\r\nin the duplicate proportion of the distance from the earth, and the\r\nother reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the same distance;\r\nthen, though the line described by the moon would not be in reality\r\nan ellipsis, yet the moon’s motion might be perfectly explained by\r\nan ellipsis, whose axis should be made to move round the earth; this\r\nmotion being in consequence, as astronomers express themselves, that\r\nis, the same way as the moon itself moves, if the moon be attracted by\r\nthe sum of the two powers; but the axis must move in antecedence, or\r\nthe contrary way, if the moon be acted on by the difference of these\r\npowers. What is meant by duplicate proportion has been often explained;\r\nnamely, that if three magnitudes, as A, B, and C, are so related, that\r\nthe second B bears the same proportion to the third C, as the first A\r\nbears to the second B, then the proportion of the first A to the third\r\nC, is the duplicate of the proportion of the first A to the second B.\r\nNow if a fourth magnitude, as D, be assumed, to which C shall bear the\r\nsame proportion as A bears to B, and B to C, then the proportion of A\r\nto D is the triplicate of the proportion of A to B.\r\n\r\n46. THE way of representing the moon’s motion in this case is thus. T\r\ndenoting the earth (in fig. 105, 106.) suppose the moon in the point\r\nA, its apogeon, or greatest distance from the earth, moving in the\r\ndirection A F perpendicular to A B, and acted upon from the earth by\r\ntwo such forces as have been named. By that power alone, which is\r\nreciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the distance, if the moon\r\nlet out from the point A with a proper degree of velocity, the ellipsis\r\nA M B may be described. But if the moon be acted upon by the sum of\r\nthe forementioned powers, and the velocity of the moon in the point\r\nA be augmented in a certain proportion[193]; or if that velocity be\r\ndiminished in a certain proportion, and the moon be acted upon by the\r\ndifference of those powers; in both these cases the line A E, which\r\nshall be described by the moon, is thus to be determined. Let the point\r\nM be that, into which the moon would have arrived in any given space of\r\ntime, had it moved in the ellipsis A M B. Draw M T, and likewise C T D\r\nin such sort, that the angle under A T M shall bear the same proportion\r\nto the angle under A T C, as the velocity, with which the ellipsis A\r\nM B must have been described, bears to the difference between this\r\nvelocity, and the velocity, with which the moon must set out from the\r\npoint A in order to describe the path A E. Let the angle A T C be taken\r\ntoward the moon (as in fig. 105.) if the moon be attracted by the sum\r\nof the powers; but the contrary way (as in fig. 106.) if by their\r\ndifference. Then let the line A B be moved into the position C D, and\r\nthe ellipsis A M B into the situation C N D, so that the point M be\r\ntranslated to L: then the point L shall fall upon the path of the moon\r\nA E.\r\n\r\n47. THE angular motion of the line A T, wereby it is removed into the\r\nsituation C T, represents the motion of the apogeon; by the means of\r\nwhich the motion of the moon might be fully explicated by the ellipsis\r\nA M B, if the action of the sun upon it was directed to the center\r\nof the earth, and reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the\r\nmoon’s distance from it. But that not being so, the apogeon will not\r\nmove in the regular manner now described. However, it is to be observed\r\nhere, that in the first of the two preceding cases, where the apogeon\r\nmoves forward, the whole centripetal power increases faster, with the\r\ndecrease of distance, than if the intire power were reciprocally in\r\nthe duplicate proportion of the distance; because one part only is in\r\nthat proportion, and the other part, which is added to this to make up\r\nthe whole power, increases faster with the decrease of distance. On\r\nthe other hand, when the centripetal power is the difference between\r\nthese two, it increases less with the decrease of the distance, than\r\nif it were simply in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the\r\ndistance. Therefore if we chuse to explain the moon’s motion by an\r\nellipsis (as is most convenient for astronomical uses to be done, and\r\nby reason of the small effect of the sun’s power, the doing so will\r\nnot be attended with any sensible error;) we may collect in general,\r\nthat when the power, by which the moon is attracted to the earth, by\r\nvarying the distance, increases in a greater than in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the distance diminished, a motion in consequence must\r\nbe ascribed to the apogeon; but that when the attraction increases\r\nin a less proportion than that named, the apogeon must have given\r\nto it a motion in antecedence[194]. It is then observed by Sir IS.\r\nNEWTON, that the first of these cases obtains, when the moon is in the\r\nconjunction and opposition; and the latter, when the moon is in the\r\nquarters: so that in the first the apogeon moves according to the order\r\nof the signs; in the other, the contrary way[195]. But, as was said\r\nbefore, the disturbance given to the action of the earth by the sun\r\nin the conjunction and opposition being near twice as great as in the\r\nquarters[196], the apogeon will advance with a greater velocity than\r\nrecede, and in the compass of a whole revolution of the moon will be\r\ncarried in consequence[197].\r\n\r\n48. IT is shewn in the next place by our author, that when the line A B\r\ncoincides with that, which joins the earth and the sun, the progressive\r\nmotion of the apogeon, when the moon is in the conjunction or\r\nopposition, exceeds the regressive in the quadratures more than in any\r\nother situation of the line A B[198]. On the contrary, when the line\r\nA B makes right angles with that, which joins the earth and sun, the\r\nretrograde motion will be more considerable[199], nay is found so great\r\nas to exceed the progressive; so that in this case the apogeon in the\r\ncompass of an intire revolution of the moon is carried in antecedence.\r\nYet from the considerations in the last paragraph the progressive\r\nmotion exceeds the other; so that in the whole the mean motion of the\r\napogeon is in consequence, according as astronomers find. Moreover, the\r\nline A B changes its situation with that, which joins the earth and\r\nsun, by such slow degrees, that the inequalities in the motion of the\r\napogeon arising from this last consideration, are much greater than\r\nwhat arises from the other[200].\r\n\r\n49. FARTHER, this unsteady motion in the apogeon is attended with\r\nanother inequality in the motion of the moon, that it cannot be\r\nexplained at all times by the same ellipsis. The ellipsis in general\r\nis called by astronomers an eccentric orbit. The point, in which the\r\ntwo axis’s cross, is called the center of the figure; because all\r\nlines drawn through this point within the ellipsis, from side to side,\r\nare divided in the middle by this point. But the center, about which\r\nthe heavenly bodies revolve, lying out of this center of the figure\r\nin one focus, these orbits are said to be eccentric; and where the\r\ndistance of the focus from this center bears the greatest proportion\r\nto the whole axis, that orbit is called the most eccentric: and in\r\nsuch an orbit the distance from the focus to the remoter extremity of\r\nthe axis bears the greatest proportion to the distance of the nearer\r\nextremity. Now whenever the apogeon of the moon moves in consequence,\r\nthe moon’s motion must be referred to an orbit more eccentric, than\r\nwhat the moon would describe, if the whole power, by which the moon\r\nwas acted on in its passing from the apogeon, changed according to the\r\nreciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance from the earth, and by\r\nthat means the moon did describe an immoveable ellipsis; and when the\r\napogeon moves in antecedence, the moon’s motion must be referred to an\r\norbit less eccentric. In the first of the two figures last referred\r\nto, the true place of the moon L falls without the orbit A M B, to\r\nwhich its motion is referred: whence the orbit A L E, truly described\r\nby the moon, is less incurvated in the point A, than is the orbit A M\r\nB; therefore the orbit A M B is more oblong, and differs farther from\r\na circle, than the ellipsis would, whose curvature in A were equal to\r\nthat of the line A L B, that is, the proportion of the distance of the\r\nearth T from the center of the ellipsis to its axis will be greater in\r\nthe ellipsis A M B, than in the other; but that other is the ellipsis,\r\nwhich the moon would describe, if the power acting upon it in the point\r\nA were altered in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance.\r\nIn the second figure, when the apogeon recedes, the place of the moon\r\nL falls within the orbit A M B, and therefore that orbit is less\r\neccentric, than the immoveable orbit which the moon should describe.\r\nThe truth of this is evident; for, when the apogeon moves forward, the\r\npower, by which the moon is influenced in its descent from the apogeon,\r\nincreases faster with the decrease of distance, than in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the distance; and consequently the moon being drawn more\r\nforcibly toward the earth, it will descend nearer to it. On the other\r\nhand, when the apogeon recedes, the power acting on the moon increases\r\nwith the decrease of distance in less than the duplicate proportion of\r\nthe distance; and therefore the moon is less impelled toward the earth,\r\nand will not descend so low.\r\n\r\n50. NOW suppose in the first of these figures, that the apogeon A is\r\nin the situation, where it is approaching toward the conjunction or\r\nopposition of the sun. In this case the progressive motion of the\r\napogeon is more and more accelerated. Here suppose that the moon, after\r\nhaving descended from A through the orbit A E as far as F, where it\r\nis come to its nearest distance from the earth, ascends again up the\r\nline F G. Because the motion of the apogeon is here continually more\r\nand more accelerating, the cause of its motion is constantly upon the\r\nincrease; that is, the power, whereby the moon is drawn to the earth,\r\nwill decrease with the increase of distance, in the moon’s ascent\r\nfrom F, in a greater proportion than that wherewith it increased with\r\nthe decrease of distance in the moon’s descent to F. Consequently\r\nthe moon will ascend higher than to the distance A T, from whence it\r\ndescended; therefore the proportion of the greatest distance of the\r\nmoon to the least is increased. And when the moon descends again, the\r\npower will yet more increase with the decrease of distance, than in the\r\nlast ascent it decreased with the augmentation of distance; the moon\r\ntherefore must descend nearer to the earth than it did before, and the\r\nproportion of the greatest distance to the least yet be more increased.\r\nThus as long as the apogeon is advancing toward the conjunction or\r\nopposition, the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon from\r\nthe earth to the least will continually increase; and the elliptical\r\norbit, to which the moon’s motion is referred, will be rendered more\r\nand more eccentric.\r\n\r\n51. AS soon as the apogeon is passed the conjunction with the sun or\r\nthe opposition, the progressive motion thereof abates, and with it\r\nthe proportion of the greatest distance of the moon from the earth to\r\nthe least distance will also diminish; and when the apogeon becomes\r\nregressive, the diminution of this proportion will be still farther\r\ncontinued on, till the apogeon comes into the quarter; from thence this\r\nproportion, and the eccentricity of the orbit will increase again.\r\nThus the orbit of the moon is most eccentric, when the apogeon is in\r\nconjunction with the sun, or in opposition to it, and least of all when\r\nthe apogeon is in the quarters.\r\n\r\n52. THESE changes in the nodes, in the inclination of the orbit to the\r\nplane of the earth’s motion, in the apogeon, and in the eccentricity,\r\nare varied like the other inequalities in the motion of the moon, by\r\nthe different distance of the earth from the sun; being greatest, when\r\ntheir cause is greatest, that is, when the earth is nearest to the sun.\r\n\r\n53. I SAID at the beginning of this chapter, that Sir ISAAC NEWTON\r\nhas computed the very quantity of many of the moon’s inequalities.\r\nThat acceleration of the moon’s motion, which is called the variation,\r\nwhen greatest, removes the moon out of the place, in which it would\r\notherwise be found, something more than half a degree[201]. In the\r\nphrase of astronomers, a degree is 1/360 part of the whole circuit of\r\nthe moon or any planet. If the moon, without disturbance from the sun,\r\nwould have described a circle concentrical to the earth, the sun will\r\ncause the moon to approach nearer to the earth in the conjunction and\r\nopposition, than in the quarters, nearly in the proportion of 69 to\r\n70[202]. We had occasion to mention above, that the nodes perform their\r\nperiod in almost 19 years. This the astronomers found by observation;\r\nand our author’s computations assign to them the same period[203].\r\nThe inclination of the moon’s orbit when least, is an angle about\r\n1/18 part of that angle, which constitutes a perpendicular; and the\r\ndifference between the greatest and least inclination of the orbit is\r\ndetermined by our author’s computation to be about 1/18 of the least\r\ninclination[204]. And this also is agreeable to the observations\r\nof astronomers. The motion of the apogeon, and the changes in the\r\neccentricity, Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has not computed. The apogeon performs\r\nits revolution in about eight years and ten months. When the moon’s\r\norbit is most eccentric, the greatest distance of the moon from the\r\nearth bears to the least distance nearly the proportion of 8 to 7; when\r\nthe orbit is least eccentric, this proportion is hardly so great as\r\nthat of 12 to 11.\r\n\r\n54. SIR ~ISAAC NEWTON~ shews farther, how, by comparing the\r\nperiods of the motion of the satellites, which revolve round Jupiter\r\nand Saturn, with the period of our moon round the earth, and the\r\nperiods of those planets round the sun with the period of our earth’s\r\nmotion, the inequalities in the motion of those satellites may be\r\nderived from the inequalities in the moon’s motion; excepting only in\r\nregard to that motion of the axis of the orbit, which in the moon makes\r\nthe motion of the apogeon; for the orbits of those satellites, as far\r\nas can be discerned by us at this distance, appearing little or nothing\r\neccentric, this motion, as deduced from the moon, must be diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP. IV.~\r\n\r\nOf ~Comets~.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the former of the two preceding chapters the powers have been\r\nexplained, which keep in motion those celestial bodies, whose courses\r\nhad been well determined by the astronomers. In the last chapter we\r\nhave shewn, how those powers have been applied by our author to the\r\nmaking a more perfect discovery of the motion of those bodies, the\r\ncourses of which were but imperfectly understood; for some of the\r\ninequalities, which we have been describing in the moon’s motion,\r\nwere unknown to the astronomers. In this chapter we are to treat of\r\na third species of the heavenly bodies, the true motion of which was\r\nnot at all apprehended before our author writ; in so much, that here\r\nSir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has not only explained the causes of the motion of\r\nthese bodies, but has performed also the part of an astronomer, by\r\ndiscovering what their motions are.\r\n\r\n2. THAT these bodies are not meteors in our air, is manifest; because\r\nthey rise and set in the same manner, as the sun and stars. The\r\nastronomers had gone so far in their inquiries concerning them, as to\r\nprove by their observations, that they moved in the etherial spaces far\r\nbeyond the moon; but they had no true notion at all of the path, which\r\nthey described. The most prevailing opinion before our author was,\r\nthat they moved in straight lines; but in what part of the heavens was\r\nnot determined. DESCARTES[205] removed them far beyond the sphere of\r\nSaturn, as finding the straight motion attributed to them, inconsistent\r\nwith the vortical fluid, by which he explains the motions of the\r\nplanets, as we have above related[206]. But Sir ISAAC NEWTON distinctly\r\nproves from astronomical observation, that the comets pass through the\r\nregion of the planets, and are mostly invisible at a less distance,\r\nthan that of Jupiter[207].\r\n\r\n3. AND from hence finding the comets to be evidently within the sphere\r\nof the sun’s action, he concludes they must, necessarily move about the\r\nsun, as the planets do[208]. The planets move in ellipsis’s; but it is\r\nnot necessary that every body, which is influenced by the sun, should\r\nmove in that particular kind of line. However our author proves, that\r\nthe power of the sun being reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of\r\nthe distance, every body acted on by the sun must either fall directly\r\ndown, or move in some conic section; of which lines I have above\r\nobserved, that there are three species, the ellipsis, parabola, and\r\nhyperbola[209]. If a body, which descends toward the sun as low as the\r\norbit of any planet, move with a swifter motion than the planet does,\r\nthat body will describe an orbit of a more oblong figure, than that\r\nof the planet, and have a longer axis at least. The velocity of the\r\nbody may be so great, that it shall move in a parabola, and having\r\nonce passed about the sun, shall ascend for ever without returning any\r\nmore: but the sun will be placed in the focus of this parabola. With a\r\nvelocity still greater the body will move in an hyperbola. But it is\r\nmost probable, that the comets move in elliptical orbits, though of a\r\nvery oblong, or in the phrase of astronomers, of a very eccentric form,\r\nsuch as is represented in fig. 107, where S is the sun, C the comet,\r\nand A B D E its orbit, wherein the distance of S and D far exceeds that\r\nof S and A. Whence it is, that they sometimes are found at a moderate\r\ndistance from the sun, and appear within the planetary regions; at\r\nother times they ascend to vast distances, far beyond the very orbit of\r\nSaturn, and so become invisible. That the comets do move in this manner\r\nis proved by our author, from computations built upon the observations,\r\nwhich astronomers had made on many comets. These computations were\r\nperformed by Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ himself upon the comet, which appeared\r\ntoward the latter end of the year 1680, and at the beginning of the\r\nyear following[210]; but the learned Dr. HALLEY prosecuted the like\r\ncomputations more at large in this, and also in many other comets[211].\r\nWhich computations are made upon propositions highly worthy of our\r\nauthor’s unparallel’d genius, such as could scarce have been discovered\r\nby any one not possessed of the utmost force of invention;\r\n\r\n4. THOSE computations depend upon this principle, that the eccentricity\r\nof the orbits of the comets is so great, that if they are really\r\nelliptical, yet they approach so near to parabolas in that part of\r\nthem, where they come under our view, that they may be taken for such\r\nwithout sensible error[212]: as in the preceding figure the parabola\r\nF A G differs in the lower part of it about A very little from the\r\nellipsis D E A B. Upon which ground our great author teaches a method\r\nof finding by three observations made upon any comet the parabola,\r\nwhich nearest agrees with its orbit[213].\r\n\r\n5. NOW what confirms this whole theory beyond the least room for\r\ndoubt is, that the places of the comets computed in the orbits, which\r\nthe method here mentioned assigns them, agree to the observations of\r\nastronomers with the same degree of exactness, as the computations\r\nof the primary planets places usually do; and this in comets, whose\r\nmotions are very extraordinary[214].\r\n\r\n6. OUR author afterwards shews how to make use of any small deviation\r\nfrom the parabola, that shall be observed, to determine whether the\r\norbits of the comets are elliptical or not, and so to discover if the\r\nsame comet returns at certain periods[215]. And upon examining the\r\ncomet in 1680, by the rule laid down for this purpose, he finds its\r\norbit to agree more exactly to an ellipsis than to a parabola, though\r\nthe ellipsis be so very eccentric, that the comet cannot perform its\r\nperiod through it in the space of 500 years[216]. Upon this Dr. HALLEY\r\nobserved, that mention is made in history of a comet, with the like\r\neminent tail as this, having appeared three several times before; the\r\nfirst of which appearances was at the death of JULIUS CESAR, and each\r\nappearance was at the distance of 575 years from the next preceding.\r\nHe therefore computed the motion of this comet in such an elliptic\r\norbit, as would require this number of years for the body to revolve\r\nthrough it; and these computations agree yet more perfectly with the\r\nobservations made on this comet, than any parabolical orbit will\r\ndo[217].\r\n\r\n7. THE comparing together different appearances of the same comet, is\r\nthe only way to discover certainly the true form of the orbit: for\r\nit is impossible to determine with exactness the figure of an orbit\r\nso exceedingly eccentric, from single observations taken in one part\r\nof it; and therefore Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~[218] proposes to compare the\r\norbits, upon the supposition that they are parabolical, of such comets\r\nas appear at different times; for if the same orbit be found to be\r\ndescribed by a comet at different times, in all probability it will\r\nbe the same comet which describes it. And here he remarks from Dr.\r\nHALLEY, that the same orbit very nearly agrees to two appearances of\r\na comet about the space of 75 years distance[219]; so that if those\r\ntwo appearances were really of the same comet, the transverse axis of\r\nthe orbit of the comet would be near 18 times the axis of the earth’s\r\norbit; and the comet, when at its greatest distance from the sun, will\r\nbe removed not less than 35 times as far as the middle distance of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n8. AND this seems to be the shortest period of any of the comets.\r\nBut it will be farther confirmed, if the same comet should return a\r\nthird time after another period of 75 years. However it is not to be\r\nexpected, that comets should preserve the same regularity in their\r\nperiods, as the planets; because the great eccentricity of their orbits\r\nmakes them liable to suffer very considerable alterations from the\r\naction of the planets, and other comets, upon them.\r\n\r\n9. IT is therefore to prevent too great disturbances in their motions\r\nfrom these causes, as our author observes, that while the planets\r\nrevolve all of them nearly in the same plane, the comets are disposed\r\nin very different ones; and distributed over all parts of the heavens;\r\nthat, when in their greatest distance from the sun, and moving slowest,\r\nthey might be removed as far as possible out of the reach of each\r\nother’s action[220]. The same end is likewise farther answered in those\r\ncomets, which by moving slowest in the aphelion, or remotest distance\r\nfrom the sun, descend nearest to it, by placing the aphelion of these\r\nat the greatest height from the sun[221].\r\n\r\n10. OUR philosopher being led by his principles to explain the motions\r\nof the comets, in the manner now related, takes occasion from thence to\r\ngive us his thoughts upon their nature and use. For which end he proves\r\nin the first place, that they must necessarily be solid and compact\r\nbodies, and by no means any sort of vapour or light substance exhaled\r\nfrom the planets or stars: because at the near distance, to which some\r\ncomets approach the sun, it could not be, but the immense heat, to\r\nwhich they are exposed, should instantaneously disperse and scatter any\r\nsuch light volatile substance[222]. In particular the forementioned\r\ncomet of 1680 descended so near the sun, as to come within a sixth\r\npart of the sun’s diameter from the surface of it. In which situation\r\nit must have been exposed, as appears by computation, to a degree of\r\nheat exceeding the heat of the sun upon our earth no less than 28000\r\ntimes; and therefore might have contracted a degree of heat 2000 times\r\ngreater, than that of red hot iron[223]. Now a substance, which could\r\nendure so intense a heat, without being dispersed in vapor, must needs\r\nbe firm and solid.\r\n\r\n11. IT is shewn likewise, that the comets are opake substances, shining\r\nby a reflected light, borrowed from the sun[224]. This is proved from\r\nthe observation, that comets, though they are approaching the earth,\r\nyet diminish in lustre, if at the same time they recede from the sun;\r\nand on the contrary, are found to encrease daily in brightness, when\r\nthey advance towards the sun, though at the same time they move from\r\nthe earth[225].\r\n\r\n12. THE comets therefore in these respects resemble the planets; that\r\nboth are durable opake bodies, and both revolve about the sun in conic\r\nsections. But farther the comets, like our earth, are surrounded by\r\nan atmosphere. The air we breath is called the earth’s atmosphere;\r\nand it is most probable, that all the other planets are invested with\r\nthe like fluid. Indeed here a difference is found between the planets\r\nand comets. The atmospheres of the planets are of so fine and subtile\r\na substance, as hardly to be discerned at any distance, by reason of\r\nthe small quantity of light which they reflect, except only in the\r\nplanet Mars. In him there is some little appearance of such a substance\r\nsurrounding him, as stars which have been covered by him are said to\r\nlook somewhat dim a small space before his body comes under them, as if\r\ntheir light, when he is near, were obstructed by his atmosphere. But\r\nthe atmospheres which surround the comets are so gross and thick, as to\r\nreflect light very copiously. They are also much greater in proportion\r\nto the body they surround, than those of the planets, if we may judge\r\nof the rest from our air; for it has been observed of comets, that the\r\nbright light appearing in the middle of them, which is reflected from\r\nthe solid body, is scarce a ninth or tenth part of the whole comet,\r\n\r\n13. I SPEAK only of the heads of the comets, the most lucid part of\r\nwhich is surrounded by a fainter light, the most lucid part being\r\nusually not above a ninth or tenth part of the whole in breadth[226].\r\nTheir tails are an appearance very peculiar, nothing of the same\r\nnature appertaining in the least degree to any other of the celestial\r\nbodies. Of that appearance there are several opinions; our author\r\nreduces them to three[227]. The two first, which he proposes, are\r\nrejected by him; but the third he approves. The first is, that they\r\narise from a beam of light transmitted through the head of the comet,\r\nin like manner as a stream of light is discerned, when the sun shines\r\ninto a darkened room through a small hole. This opinion, as Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ observes, implies the authors of it wholly unskilled in the\r\nprinciples of optics; for that stream of light, seen in a darkened\r\nroom, arises from the reflection of the sun beams by the dust and motes\r\nfloating in the air: for the rays of light themselves are not seen,\r\nbut by their being reflected to the eye from some substance, upon\r\nwhich they fall[228]. The next opinion examined by our author is that\r\nof the celebrated DESCARTES, who imagins these tails to be the light\r\nof the comet refracted in its passage to us, and thence affording an\r\noblong representation; as the light of the sun does, when refracted\r\nby the prism in that noted experiment, which will have a great share\r\nin the third book of this discourse[229]. But this opinion is at once\r\noverturned from this consideration only, that the planets could be\r\nno more free from this refraction than the comets; nay ought to have\r\nlarger or brighter tails, than they, because the light of the planets\r\nis strongest. However our author has thought proper to add some farther\r\nobjections against this opinion: for instance, that these tails are not\r\nvariegated with colours, as is the image produced by the prism, and\r\nwhich is inseparable from that unequal refraction, which produces that\r\ndisproportioned length of the image. And besides, when the light in\r\nits passage from different comets to the earth describes the same path\r\nthrough the heavens, the refraction of it should of necessity be in all\r\nrespects the same. But this is contrary to observation; for the comet\r\nin 1680, the 28th day of December, and a former comet in the year 1577,\r\nthe 29th day of December, appear’d in the same place of the heavens,\r\nthat is, were seen adjacent to the same fixed stars, the earth likewise\r\nbeing in the same place at both times; yet the tail of the latter comet\r\ndeviated from the opposition to the sun a little to the northward, and\r\nthe tail of the former comet declined from the opposition of the sun\r\nfive times as much southward[230].\r\n\r\n14. THERE are some other false opinions, though less regarded than\r\nthese, which have been advanced upon this argument. These our\r\nexcellent author passes over, hastening to explain, what he takes to\r\nbe the true cause of this appearance. He thinks it is certainly owing\r\nto steams and vapours exhaled from the body, and gross atmosphere of\r\nthe comets, by the heat of the sun; because all the appearances agree\r\nperfectly to this sentiment. The tails are but small, while the comet\r\nis descending to the sun, but enlarge themselves to an immense degree,\r\nas soon as ever the comet has passed its perihelion; which shews the\r\ntail to depend upon the degree of heat, which the comet receives from\r\nthe sun. And that the intense heat to which comets, when nearest the\r\nsun, are exposed, should exhale from them a very copious vapour, is a\r\nmost reasonable supposition; especially if we consider, that in those\r\nfree and empty regions steams will more easily ascend, than here upon\r\nthe surface of the earth, where they are suppressed and hindered from\r\nrising by the weight of the incumbent air: as we find by experiments\r\nmade in vessels exhausted of the air, where upon removal of the air\r\nseveral substances will fume and discharge steams plentifully, which\r\nemit none in the open air. The tails of comets, like such a vapour,\r\nare always in the plane of the comet’s orbit, and opposite to the\r\nsun, except that the upper part thereof inclines towards the parts,\r\nwhich the comet has left by its motion; resembling perfectly the smoak\r\nof a burning coal, which, if the coal remain fixed, ascends from it\r\nperpendicularly; but, if the coal be in motion, ascends obliquely,\r\ninclining from the motion of the coal. And besides, the tails of\r\ncomets may be compared to this smoak in another respect, that both\r\nof them are denser and more compact on the convex side, than on the\r\nconcave. The different appearance of the head of the comet, after it\r\nhas past its perihelion, from what it had before, confirms greatly this\r\nopinion of their tails: for smoke raised by a strong heat is blacker\r\nand grosser, than when raised by a less; and accordingly the heads of\r\ncomets, at the same distance from the sun, are observed less bright and\r\nshining after the perihelion, than before, as if obscured by such a\r\ngross smoke.\r\n\r\n15. THE observations of HEVELIUS upon the atmospheres of comets still\r\nfarther illustrate the same; who relates, that the atmospheres,\r\nespecially that part of them next the sun, are remarkably contracted\r\nwhen near the sun, and dilated again afterwards.\r\n\r\n16. TO give a more full idea of these tails, a rule is laid down by\r\nour author, whereby to determine at any time, when the vapour in the\r\nextremity of the tail first rose from the head of the comet. By this\r\nrule it is found, that the tail does not consist of a fleeting vapour,\r\ndissipated soon after it is raised, but is of long continuance; that\r\nalmost all the vapour, which rose about the time of the perihelion from\r\nthe comet of 1680, continued to accompany it, ascending by degrees,\r\nbeing succeeded constantly by fresh matter, which rendered the tail\r\ncontiguous to the comet. From this computation the tails are found to\r\nparticipate of another property of ascending vapours, that, when they\r\nascend with the greatest velocity, they are least incurvated.\r\n\r\n17. THE only objection that can be made against this opinion is the\r\ndifficulty of explaining, how a sufficient quantity of vapour can\r\nbe raised from the atmosphere of a comet to fill those vast spaces,\r\nthrough which their tails are sometimes extended. This our author\r\nremoves by the following computation: our air being an elastic fluid,\r\nas has been said before[231], is more dense here near the surface of\r\nthe earth, where it is pressed upon by the whole air above; than it is\r\nat a distance from the earth, where it has a less weight incumbent. I\r\nhave observed, that the density of the air is reciprocally proportional\r\nto the compressing weight. From hence our author computes to what\r\ndegree of rarity the air must be expanded, according to this rule, at\r\nan height equal to a semidiameter of the earth: and he finds, that\r\na globe of such air, as we breath here on the surface of the earth,\r\nwhich shall be one inch only in diameter, if it were expanded to the\r\ndegree of rarity, which the air must have at the height now mentioned,\r\nwould fill all the planetary regions even to the very sphere of Saturn,\r\nand far beyond. Now since the air at a greater height will be still\r\nimmensly more rarified, and the surface of the atmospheres of comets is\r\nusually about ten times the distance from the center of the comet, as\r\nthe surface of the comet it self, and the tails are yet vastly farther\r\nremoved from the center of the comet; the vapour, which composes those\r\ntails, may very well be allowed to be so expanded, as that a moderate\r\nquantity of matter may fill all that space, they are seen to take up.\r\nThough indeed the atmospheres of comets being very gross, they will\r\nhardly be rarified in their tails to so great a degree, as our air\r\nunder the same circumstances; especially since they may be something\r\ncondensed, as well by their gravitation to the sun, as that the parts\r\nwill gravitate to one another; which will hereafter be shewn to be the\r\nuniversal property of all matter[232]. The only scruple left is, how so\r\nmuch light can be reflected from a vapour so rare, as this computation\r\nimplies. For the removal of which our author observes, that the most\r\nrefulgent of these tails hardly appear brighter, than a beam of the\r\nsun’s light transmitted into a darkened room through a hole of a single\r\ninch diameter; and that the smallest fixed stars are visible through\r\nthem without any sensible diminution of their lustre.\r\n\r\n18. ALL these considerations put it beyond doubt, what is the true\r\nnature of the tails of comets. There has indeed nothing been said,\r\nwhich will account for the irregular figures, in which those tails\r\nare sometimes reported to have appeared; but since none of those\r\nappearances have ever been recorded by astronomers, who on the contrary\r\nascribe the same likeness to the tails of all comets, our author\r\nwith great judgment refers all those to accidental refractions by\r\nintervening clouds, or to parts of the milky way contiguous to the\r\ncomets[233].\r\n\r\n19. THE discussion of this appearance in comets has led Sir ~ISAAC\r\nNEWTON~ into some speculations relating to their use, which I cannot\r\nbut extreamly admire, as representing in the strongest light\r\nimaginable the extensive providence of the great author of nature,\r\nwho, besides the furnishing this globe of earth, and without doubt\r\nthe rest of the planets, so abundantly with every thing necessary\r\nfor the support and continuance of the numerous races of plants and\r\nanimals, they are stocked with, has over and above provided a numerous\r\ntrain of comets, far exceeding the number of the planets, to rectify\r\ncontinually, and restore their gradual decay, which is our author’s\r\nopinion concerning them[234]. For since the comets are subject to such\r\nunequal degrees of heat, being sometimes burnt with the most intense\r\ndegree of it, at other times scarce receiving any sensible influence\r\nfrom the sun; it can hardly be supposed, they are designed for any\r\nsuch constant use, as the planets. Now the tails, which they emit,\r\nlike all other kinds of vapour, dilate themselves as they ascend, and\r\nby consequence are gradually dispersed and scattered through all the\r\nplanetary regions, and thence cannot but be gathered up by the planets,\r\nas they pass through their orbs: for the planets having a power to\r\ncause all bodies to gravitate towards them, as will in the sequel of\r\nthis discourse be shewn[235]; these vapours will be drawn in process of\r\ntime into this or the other planet, which happens to act strongest upon\r\nthem. And by entering the atmospheres of the earth and other planets,\r\nthey may well be supposed to contribute to the renovation of the face\r\nof things, in particular to supply the diminution caused in the humid\r\nparts by vegetation and putrefaction. For vegetables are nourished by\r\nmoisture, and by putrefaction are turned in great part into dry earth;\r\nand an earthy substance always subsides in fermenting liquors; by which\r\nmeans the dry parts of the planets must continually increase, and the\r\nfluids diminish, nay in a sufficient length of time be exhausted, if\r\nnot supplied by some such means. It is farther our great author’s\r\nopinion, that the most subtile and active parts of our air, upon which\r\nthe life of things chiefly depends, is derived to us, and supplied\r\nby the comets. So far are they from portending any hurt or mischief\r\nto us, which the natural fears of men are so apt to suggest from the\r\nappearance of any thing uncommon and astonishing.\r\n\r\n20. THAT the tails of comets have some such important use seems\r\nreasonable, if we consider, that those bodies do not send out those\r\nfumes merely by their near approach to the sun; but are framed of a\r\ntexture, which disposes them in a particular manner to fume in that\r\nsort: for the earth, without emitting any such steam, is more than half\r\nthe year at a less distance from the sun, than the comet of 1664 and\r\n1665 approached it, when nearest; likewise the comets of 1682 and 1683\r\nnever approached the sun much above a seventh part nearer than Venus,\r\nand were more than half as far again from the sun as Mercury; yet all\r\nthese emitted tails.\r\n\r\n21. FROM the very near approach of the comet of 1680 our author draws\r\nanother speculation; for if the sun have an atmosphere about it, the\r\ncomet mentioned seems to have descended near enough to the sun to\r\nenter within it. If so, it must have been something retarded by the\r\nresistance it would meet with, and consequently in its next descent to\r\nthe sun will fall nearer than now; by which means it will meet with a\r\ngreater resistance, and be again more retarded. The event of which must\r\nbe, that at length it will impinge upon the sun’s surface, and thereby\r\nsupply any decrease, which may have happened by so long an emission of\r\nlight, or otherwise. And something like this our author conjectures\r\nmay be the case of those fixed stars which by an additional increase\r\nof their lustre have for a certain time become visible to us, though\r\nusually they are out of sight. There is indeed a kind of fixed stars,\r\nwhich appear and disappear at regular and equal intervals: here some\r\nmore steady cause must be sought for; perhaps these stars turn round\r\ntheir own axis’s, as our sun does[236], and have some part of their\r\nbody more luminous than the other, whereby they are seen, when the most\r\nlucid part is next to us, and when the darker part is turned toward us,\r\nthey vanish out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. WHETHER the sun does really diminish, as has been here suggested,\r\nis difficult to prove; yet that it either does so, or that the earth\r\nincreases, if not both, is rendered probable from Dr. HALLEY’s\r\nobservation[237], that by comparing the proportion, which the\r\nperiodical time of the moon bore to that of the sun in former times,\r\nwith the proportion between them at present, the moon is found to be\r\nsomething accelerated in respect of the sun. But if the sun diminish,\r\nthe periods of the primary planets will be lengthened; and if the earth\r\nbe encreased, the period of the moon will be shortened: as will appear\r\nby the next chapter, wherein it shall be shewn, that the power of the\r\nsun and earth is the result of the same power being lodg’d in all their\r\nparts, and that this principle of producing gravitation in other bodies\r\nis proportional to the solid matter in each body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP~. V.\r\n\r\nOf the BODIES of the SUN and PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR author, after having discovered that the celestial motions are\r\nperformed by a force extended from the sun and primary planets, follows\r\nthis power into the deepest recesses of those bodies themselves, and\r\nproves the same to accompany the smallest particle, of which they are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PREPARATIVE hereto he shews first, that each of the heavenly bodies\r\nattracts the rest, and all bodies, with such different degrees of\r\nforce, as that the force of the same attracting body is exerted on\r\nothers exactly in proportion to the quantity of matter in the body\r\nattracted[238].\r\n\r\n3. OF this the first proof he brings is from experiments made here\r\nupon the earth. The power by which the moon is influenced was above\r\nshewn to be the same, with that power here on the surface of the earth,\r\nwhich we call gravity[239]. Now one of the effects of the principle\r\nof gravity is, that all bodies descend by this force from the same\r\nheight in equal times. Which has been long taken notice of; particular\r\nmethods having been invented to shew that the only cause, why some\r\nbodies were observed to fall from the same height sooner than others,\r\nwas the resistance of the air. This we have above related[240]; and\r\nproved from hence, that since bodies resist to any change of their\r\nstate from rest to motion, or from motion to rest, in proportion to the\r\nquantity of matter contained in them; the power that can move different\r\nquantities of matter equally, must be proportional to the quantity. The\r\nonly objection here is, that it can hardly be made certain, whether\r\nthis proportion in the effect of gravity on different bodies holds\r\nperfectly exact or not from these experiments; by reason that the\r\ngreat swiftness, with which bodies fall, prevents our being able to\r\ndetermine the times of their descent with all the exactness requisite.\r\nTherefore to remedy this inconvenience, our author substitutes another\r\nmore certain experiment in the room of these made upon falling bodies.\r\nPendulums are caused to vibrate by the same principle, as makes\r\nbodies descend; the power of gravity putting them in motion, as well\r\nas the other. But if the ball of any pendulum, of the same length with\r\nanother, were more or less attracted in proportion to the quantity of\r\nsolid matter in the ball, that pendulum must accordingly move faster or\r\nslower than the other. Now the vibrations of pendulums continue for a\r\ngreat length of time, and the number of vibrations they make may easily\r\nbe determined without suspicion of error; so that this experiment may\r\nbe extended to what exactness one pleases: and our author assures us,\r\nthat he examined in this way several substances, as gold, silver, lead,\r\nglass, sand, common salt, wood, water, and wheat; in all which he found\r\nnot the least deviation from the proportion mentioned, though he made\r\nthe experiment in such a manner, that in bodies of the same weight a\r\ndifference in the quantity of their matter less than a thousandth part\r\nof the whole would have discovered it self[241]. It appears therefore,\r\nthat all bodies are made to descend by the power of gravity here, near\r\nthe surface of the earth, with the same degree of swiftness. We have\r\nabove observed this descent to be after the rate of 16⅛ feet in the\r\nfirst second of time from the beginning of their fall. Moreover it\r\nwas also observed, that if any body, which fell here at the surface\r\nof the earth after this rate, were to be conveyed up to the height of\r\nthe moon, it would descend from thence just with the same degree of\r\nvelocity, as that with which the moon is attracted toward the earth;\r\nand therefore the power of the earth upon the moon bears the same\r\nproportion to the power it would have upon those bodies at the same\r\ndistance, as the quantity of matter in the moon bears to the quantity\r\nin those bodies.\r\n\r\n4. THUS the assertion laid down is proved in the earth, that the power\r\nof the earth on every body it attracts is, at the same distance from\r\nthe earth, proportional to the quantity of solid matter in the body\r\nacted on. As to the sun, it has been shewn, that the power of the sun’s\r\naction upon the same primary planet is reciprocally in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the distance; and that the power of the sun decreases\r\nthroughout in the same proportion, the motion of comets traversing the\r\nwhole planetary region testifies. This proves, that if any planet were\r\nremoved from the sun to any other distance whatever, the degree of\r\nits acceleration toward the sun would yet remain reciprocally in the\r\nduplicate proportion of its distance. But it has likewise been shewn,\r\nthat the degree of acceleration, which the sun gives to every one of\r\nthe planets, is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of their\r\nrespective distances. All which compared together puts it out of doubt,\r\nthat the power of the sun upon any planet, removed into the place of\r\nany ether, would give it the same velocity of descent, as it gives that\r\nother; and consequently, that the sun’s action upon different planets\r\nat the same distance would be proportional to the quantity of matter\r\nin each. It has farther been shewn, that the sun attracts the primary\r\nplanets, and their respective secondary, when at the same distance, so\r\nas to communicate to both the same degree of velocity; and therefore\r\nthe force, wherewith the sun acts on the secondary planet, bears\r\nthe same proportion to the force, wherewith at the same distance it\r\nattracts the primary, as the quantity of solid matter in the secondary\r\nplanet bears to the quantity of matter in the primary.\r\n\r\n5. THIS property therefore is proved of both kinds of planets, in\r\nrespect of the sun. Therefore the sun possesses the quality found in\r\nthe earth, of acting on bodies with a degree of force proportional to\r\nthe quantity of matter in the body, which receives the influence.\r\n\r\n6. THAT the power of attraction, with which the other planets are\r\nendued, should differ from that of the earth, can hardly be supposed,\r\nif we consider the similitude between those bodies; and that it does\r\nnot in this respect, is farther proved from the satellites of Saturn\r\nand Jupiter, which are attracted by their respective primary according\r\nto the same law, that is, in the same proportion to their distances, as\r\nthe primary are attracted by the sun: so that what has been concluded\r\nof the sun in relation to the primary planets, may be justly concluded\r\nof these primary in respect of their secondary, and in consequence\r\nof that, in regard likewise to all other bodies, viz. that they will\r\nattract every body in proportion to the quantity of solid matter it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\n7. HENCE it follows, that this attraction extends itself to every\r\nparticle of matter in the attracted body: and that no portion of matter\r\nwhatever is exempted from the influence of those bodies, to which we\r\nhave proved this attractive power to belong.\r\n\r\n8. BEFORE we proceed farther, we may here remark, that this attractive\r\npower both of the sun and planets now appears to be quite of the same\r\nnature in all; for it acts in each in the same proportion to the\r\ndistance, and in the same manner acts alike upon every particle of\r\nmatter. This power therefore in the sun and other planets is not of a\r\ndifferent nature from this power in the earth; which has been already\r\nshewn to be the same with that, which we call gravity[242].\r\n\r\n9. AND this lays open the way to prove, that the attracting power\r\nlodged in the sun and planets, belongs likewise to every part of them:\r\nand that their respective powers upon the same body are proportional to\r\nthe quantity of matter, of which they are composed; for instance, that\r\nthe force with which the earth attracts the moon, is to the force, with\r\nwhich the sun would attract it at the same distance, as the quantity of\r\nsolid matter contained in the earth, to the quantity contained in the\r\nsun[243].\r\n\r\n10. THE first of these assertions is a very evident consequence from\r\nthe latter. And before we proceed to the proof, it must first be\r\nshewn, that the third law of motion, which makes action and reaction\r\nequal, holds in these attractive powers. The most remarkable attractive\r\nforce, next to the power of gravity, is that, by which the loadstone\r\nattracts iron. Now if a loadstone were laid upon water, and supported\r\nby some proper substance, as wood or cork, so that it might swim;\r\nand if a piece of iron were caused to swim upon the water in like\r\nmanner: as soon as the loadstone begins to attract the iron, the iron\r\nshall move toward the stone, and the stone shall also move toward\r\nthe iron; when they meet, they shall stop each other, and remain\r\nfixed together without any motion. This shews, that the velocities,\r\nwherewith they meet, are reciprocally proportional to the quantities\r\nof solid matter in each; and that by the stone’s attracting the iron,\r\nthe stone itself receives as much motion, in the strict philosophic\r\nsense of that word[244], as it communicates to the iron: for it has\r\nbeen declared above to be an effect of the percussion of two bodies,\r\nthat if they meet with velocities reciprocally proportional to the\r\nrespective bodies, they shall be stopped by the concourse, unless their\r\nelasticity put them into fresh motion; but if they meet with any other\r\nvelocities, they shall retain some motion after meeting[245]. Amber,\r\nglass, sealing-wax, and many other substances acquire by rubbing a\r\npower, which from its having been remarkable, particularly in amber,\r\nis called electrical. By this power they will for some time after\r\nrubbing attract light bodies, that shall be brought within the sphere\r\nof their activity. On the other hand Mr. BOYLE found, that if a piece\r\nof amber be hung in a perpendicular position by a string, it shall be\r\ndrawn itself toward the body whereon it was rubbed, if that body be\r\nbrought near it. Both in the loadstone and in electrical bodies we\r\nusually ascribe the power to the particular body, whose presence we\r\nfind necessary for producing the effect. The loadstone and any piece of\r\niron will draw each other, but in two pieces of iron no such effect is\r\nordinarily observed; therefore we call this attractive power the power\r\nof the loadstone: though near a loadstone two pieces of iron will also\r\ndraw each other. In like manner the rubbing of amber, glass, or any\r\nsuch body, till it is grown warm, being necessary to cause any action\r\nbetween those bodies and other substances, we ascribe the electrical\r\npower to those bodies. But in all these cases if we would speak more\r\ncorrectly, and not extend the sense of our expressions beyond what\r\nwe see; we can only say that the neighbourhood of a loadstone and a\r\npiece of iron is attended with a power, whereby the loadstone and\r\nthe iron are drawn toward each other; and the rubbing of electrical\r\nbodies gives rise to a power, whereby those bodies and other substances\r\nare mutually attracted. Thus we must also understand in the power of\r\ngravity, that the two bodies are mutually made to approach by the\r\naction of that power. When the sun draws any planet, that planet also\r\ndraws the sun; and the motion, which the planet receives from the\r\nsun, bears the same proportion to the motion, which the sun it self\r\nreceives, as the quantity of solid matter in the sun bears to the\r\nquantity of solid matter in the planet. Hitherto, for brevity sake\r\nin speaking of these forces, we have generally ascribed them to the\r\nbody, which is least moved; as when we called the power, which exerts\r\nitself between the sun and any planet, the attractive power of the sun;\r\nbut to speak more correctly, we should rather call this power in any\r\ncase the force, which acts between the sun and earth, between the sun\r\nand Jupiter, between the earth and moon, &c. for both the bodies are\r\nmoved by the power acting between them, in the same manner, as when\r\ntwo bodies are tied together by a rope, if that rope shrink by being\r\nwet, or otherwise, and thereby cause the bodies to approach, by drawing\r\nboth, it will communicate to both the same degree of motion, and cause\r\nthem to approach with velocities reciprocally proportional to the\r\nrespective bodies. From this mutual action between the sun and planet\r\nit follows, as has been observed above[246], that the sun and planet do\r\neach move about their common center of gravity. Let A (in fig. 108.)\r\nrepresent the sun, B a planet, C their common center of gravity. If\r\nthese bodies were once at rest, by their mutual attraction they would\r\ndirectly approach each other with such velocities, that their common\r\ncenter of gravity would remain at rest, and the two bodies would at\r\nlength meet in that point. If the planet B were to receive an impulse,\r\nas in the direction of the line D E, this would prevent the two bodies\r\nfrom falling together; but their common center of gravity would be\r\nput into motion in the direction of the line C F equidistant from B E.\r\nIn this case Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ proves[247], that the sun and planet\r\nwould describe round their common center of gravity similar orbits,\r\nwhile that center would proceed with an uniform motion in the line C\r\nF; and so the system of the two bodies would move on with the center\r\nof gravity without end. In order to keep the system in the same place,\r\nit is necessary, that when the planet received its impulse in the\r\ndirection B E, the sun should also receive such an impulse the contrary\r\nway, as might keep the center of gravity C without motion; for if these\r\nbegan once to move without giving any motion to their common center of\r\ngravity, that center would always remain fixed.\r\n\r\n11. BY this may be understood in what manner the action between the sun\r\nand planets is mutual. But farther, we have shewn above[248], that the\r\npower, which acts between the sun and primary planets, is altogether of\r\nthe same nature with that, which acts between the earth and the bodies\r\nat its surface, or between the earth and its parts, and with that which\r\nacts between the primary planets and their secondary; therefore all\r\nthese actions must be ascribed to the same cause[249]. Again, it has\r\nbeen already proved, that in different planets the force of the sun’s\r\naction upon each at the same distance would be proportional to the\r\nquantity of solid matter in the planet[250]; therefore the reaction\r\nof each planet on the sun at the same distance, or the motion, which\r\nthe sun would receive from each planet, would also be proportional\r\nto the quantity of matter in the planet; that is, these planets at\r\nthe same distance would act on the same body with degrees of strength\r\nproportional to the quantity of solid matter in each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. IN the next place, from what has been now proved, our great author\r\nhas deduced this farther consequence, no less surprizing than elegant;\r\nthat each of the particles, out of which the bodies of the sun and\r\nplanets are framed, exert their power of gravitation by the same law,\r\nand in the same proportion to the distance, as the great bodies which\r\nthey compose. For this purpose he first demonstrates, that if a globe\r\nwere compounded of particles, which will attract the particles of any\r\nother body reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of their distances,\r\nthe whole globe will attract the same in the reciprocal duplicate\r\nproportion of their distances from the center of the globe; provided\r\nthe globe be of uniform density throughout[251]. And from this our\r\nauthor deduces the reverse, that if a globe acts upon distant bodies by\r\nthe law just now specified, and the power of the globe is derived from\r\nits being composed of attractive particles; each of those particles\r\nwill attract after the same proportion[252]. The manner of deducing\r\nthis is not set down at large by our author, but is as follows. The\r\nglobe is supposed to act upon the particles of a body without it\r\nconstantly in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of their distances\r\nfrom its center; and therefore at the same distance from the globe, on\r\nwhich side soever the body be placed, the globe will act equally upon\r\nit. Now because, if the particles, of which the globe is composed,\r\nacted upon those without in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of\r\ntheir distances, the whole globe would act upon them in the same manner\r\nas it does; therefore, if the particles of the globe have not all of\r\nthem that property, some must act stronger than in that proportion,\r\nwhile others act weaker: and if this be the condition of the globe,\r\nit is plain, that when the body attracted is in such a situation\r\nin respect of the globe, that the greater number of the strongest\r\nparticles are nearest to it, the body will be more forcibly attracted;\r\nthan when by turning the globe about, the greater quantity of weak\r\nparticles should be nearest, though the distance of the body should\r\nremain the same from the center of the globe. Which is contrary to what\r\nwas at first remarked, that the globe on all sides of it acts with the\r\nsame strength at the same distance. Whence it appears, that no other\r\nconstitution of the globe can agree to it.\r\n\r\n13. FROM these propositions it is farther collected, that if all\r\nthe particles of one globe attract all the particles of another in\r\nthe proportion so often mentioned, the attracting globe will act\r\nupon the other in the same proportion to the distance between the\r\ncenter of the globe which attracts, and the center of that which is\r\nattracted[253]: and farther, that this proportion holds true, though\r\neither or both the globes be composed of dissimilar parts, some rarer\r\nand some more dense; provided only, that all the parts in the same\r\nglobe equally distant from the center be homogeneous[254]. And also,\r\nif both the globes attract each other[255]. All which place it beyond\r\ncontradiction, that this proportion obtains with as much exactness\r\nnear and contiguous to the surface of attracting globes, as at greater\r\ndistances from them.\r\n\r\n14. THUS our author, without the pompous pretence of explaining the\r\ncause of gravity, has made one very important step toward it, by\r\nshewing that this power in the great bodies of the universe, is derived\r\nfrom the same power being lodged in every particle of the matter which\r\ncomposes them: and consequently, that this property is no less than\r\nuniversal to all matter whatever, though the power be too minute to\r\nproduce any visible effects on the small bodies, wherewith we converse,\r\nby their action on each other[256]. In the fixed stars indeed we have\r\nno particular proof that they have this power; for we find no apperance\r\nto demonstrate that they either act, or are acted upon by it. But\r\nsince this power is found to belong to all bodies, whereon we can make\r\nobservation; and we see that it is not to be altered by any change in\r\nthe form of bodies, but always accompanies them in every shape without\r\ndiminution, remaining ever proportional to the quantity of solid matter\r\nin each; such a power must without doubt belong universally to all\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n15. THIS therefore is the universal law of matter; which recommends\r\nit self no less for its great plainness and simplicity, than for the\r\nsurprizing discoveries it leads us to. By this principle we learn the\r\ndifferent weight, which the same body will have upon the surfaces\r\nof the sun and of diverse planets; and by the same we can judge of\r\nthe composition of those celestial bodies, and know the density of\r\neach; which is formed of the most compact, and which of the most rare\r\nsubstance. Let the adversaries of this philosophy reflect here, whether\r\nloading this principle with the appellation of an occult quality, or\r\nperpetual miracle, or any other reproachful name, be sufficient to\r\ndissuade us from cultivating it; since this quality, which they call\r\noccult, leads to the knowledge of such things, that it would have\r\nbeen reputed no less than madness for any one, before they had been\r\ndiscovered, even to have conjectured that our faculties should ever\r\nhave reached so far.\r\n\r\n16. SEE how all this naturally follows from the foregoing principles\r\nin those planets, which have satellites moving about them. By the\r\ntimes, in which these satellites perform their revolutions, compared\r\nwith their distances from their respective primary, the proportion\r\nbetween the power, with which one primary attracts his satellites, and\r\nthe force with which any other attracts his will be known; and the\r\nproportion of the power with which any planet attracts its secondary,\r\nto the power with which it attracts a body at its surface is found,\r\nby comparing the distance of the secondary planet from the center of\r\nthe primary, to the distance of the primary planet’s surface from the\r\nsame: and from hence is deduced the proportion between the power of\r\ngravity upon the surface of one planet, to the gravity upon the surface\r\nof another. By the like method of comparing the periodical time of a\r\nprimary planet about the sun, with the revolution of a satellite about\r\nits primary, may be found the proportion of gravity, or of the weight\r\nof any body upon the surface of the sun, to the gravity, or to the\r\nweight of the same body upon the surface of the planet, which carries\r\nabout the satellite.\r\n\r\n17. BY these kinds of computation it is found, that the weight of the\r\nsame body upon the surface of the sun will be about 23 times as great,\r\nas here upon the surface of the earth; about 10⅗ times as great, as\r\nupon the surface of Jupiter; and near 19 times as great, as upon the\r\nsurface of Saturn[257].\r\n\r\n18. THE quantity of matter, which composes each of these bodies, is\r\nproportional to the power it has upon a body at a given distance. By\r\nthis means it is found, that the sun contains 1067 times as much matter\r\nas Jupiter; Jupiter 158⅔ times as much as the earth, and 2-5/6 times as\r\nmuch as Saturn[258]. The diameter of the sun is about 92 times, that of\r\nJupiter about 9 times, and that of Saturn about 7 times the diameter of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n19. BY making a comparison between the quantity of matter in these\r\nbodies and their magnitudes, to be found from their diameters, their\r\nrespective densities are readily deduced; the density of every body\r\nbeing measured by the quantity of matter contained under the same bulk,\r\nas has been above remarked[259]. Thus the earth is found 4¼ times\r\nmore dense than Jupiter; Saturn has between ⅔ and ¾ of the density of\r\nJupiter; but the sun has one fourth part only of the density of the\r\nearth[260]. From which this observation is drawn by our author; that\r\nthe sun is rarified by its great heat, and that of the three planets\r\nnamed, the more dense is nearer the sun than the more rare; as was\r\nhighly reasonable to expect, the densest bodies requiring the greatest\r\nheat to agitate and put their parts in motion; as on the contrary, the\r\nplanets which are more rare, would be rendered unfit for their office,\r\nby the intense heat to which the denser are exposed. Thus the waters\r\nof our seas, if removed to the distance of Saturn from the sun, would\r\nremain perpetually frozen; and if as near the sun as Mercury, would\r\nconstantly boil[261].\r\n\r\n20. THE densities of the three planets Mercury, Venus, and Mars, which\r\nhave no satellites, cannot be expresly assigned; but from what is\r\nfound in the others, it is very probable, that they also are of such\r\ndifferent degrees of density, that universally the planet which is\r\nnearest to the sun, is formed of the most compact substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP~. VI.\r\n\r\nOf the FLUID PARTS of the PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS globe, that we inhabit, is composed of two parts; the solid earth,\r\nwhich affords us a foundation to dwell upon; and the seas and other\r\nwaters, that furnish rains and vapours necessary to render the earth\r\nfruitful, and productive of what is requisite for the support of life.\r\nAnd that the moon, though but a secondary planet, is composed in like\r\nmanner, is generally thought, from the different degrees of light\r\nwhich appear on its surface; the parts of that planet, which reflect a\r\ndim light, being supposed to be fluid, and to imbibe the sun’s rays,\r\nwhile the solid parts reflect them more copiously. Some indeed do not\r\nallow this to be a conclusive argument: but whether we can distinguish\r\nthe fluid part of the moon’s surface from the rest or not; yet it is\r\nmost probable that there are two such different parts, and with still\r\ngreater reason we may ascribe the like to the other primary planets,\r\nwhich yet more nearly resemble our earth. The earth is also encompassed\r\nby another fluid the air, and we have before remarked, that probably\r\nthe rest of the planets are surrounded by the like. These fluid parts\r\nin particular engage our author’s attention, both by reason of some\r\nremarkable appearances peculiar to them, and likewise of some effects\r\nthey have upon the whole bodies to which they belong.\r\n\r\n2. FLUIDS have been already treated of in general, with respect to the\r\neffect they have upon solid bodies moving in them[262]; now we must\r\nconsider them in reference to the operation of the power of gravity\r\nupon them. By this power they are rendered weighty, like all other\r\nbodies, in proportion to the quantity of matter, which is contained\r\nin them. And in any quantity of a fluid the upper parts press upon\r\nthe lower as much, as any solid body would press on another, whereon\r\nit should lie. But there is an effect of the pressure of fluids on\r\nthe bottom of the vessel, wherein they are contained, which I shall\r\nparticularly explain. The force supported by the bottom of such a\r\nvessel is not simply the weight of the quantity of the fluid in the\r\nvessel, but is equal to the weight of that quantity of the fluid, which\r\nwould be contained in a vessel of the same bottom and of equal width\r\nthroughout, when this vessel is filled up to the same height, as that\r\nto which the vessel proposed is filled. Suppose water were contained\r\nin the vessel A B C D (in fig. 109.) filled up to E F. Here it is\r\nevident, that if a part of the bottom, as G H, which is directly under\r\nany part of the space E F, be considered separately; it will appear\r\nat once, that this part sustains the weight of as much of the fluid,\r\nas stands perpendicularly over it up to the height of E F; that is,\r\nthe two perpendiculars G I and H K being drawn, the part G H of the\r\nbottom will sustain the whole weight of the fluid included between\r\nthese two perpendiculars. Again, I say, every other part of the bottom\r\nequally broad with this, will sustain as great a pressure. Let the\r\npart L M be of the same breadth with G H. Here the perpendiculars\r\nL O and M N being drawn, the quantity of water contained between\r\nthese perpendiculars is not so great, as that contained between the\r\nperpendiculars G I and H K; yet, I say, the pressure on L M will be\r\nequal to that on G H. This will appear by the following considerations.\r\nIt is evident, that if the part of the vessel between O and N were\r\nremoved, the water would immediately flow out, and the surface E F\r\nwould subside; for all parts of the water being equally heavy, it must\r\nsoon form itself to a level surface, if the form of the vessel, which\r\ncontains it, does not prevent. Therefore since the water is prevented\r\nfrom rising by the side N O of the vessel, it is manifest, that it must\r\npress against N O with some degree of force. In other words, the water\r\nbetween the perpendiculars L O and M N endeavours to extend itself with\r\na certain degree of force; or more correctly, the ambient water presses\r\nupon this, and endeavours to force this pillar or column of water into\r\na greater length. But since this column of water is sustained between\r\nN O and L M, each of these parts of the vessel will be equally pressed\r\nagainst by the power, wherewith this column endeavours to extend.\r\nConsequently L M bears this force over and above the weight of the\r\ncolumn of water between L O and M N. To know what this expansive force\r\nis, let the part O N of the vessel be removed, and the perpendiculars\r\nL O and M N be prolonged; then by means of some pipe fixed over N O\r\nlet water be filled between these perpendiculars up to P Q an equal\r\nheight with E F. Here the water between the perpendiculars L P and M Q\r\nis of an equal height with the highest part of the water in the vessel;\r\ntherefore the water in the vessel cannot by its pressure force it\r\nup higher, nor can the water in this column subside; because, if it\r\nshould, it would raise the water in the vessel to a greater height than\r\nitself. But it follows from hence, that the weight of water contained\r\nbetween P O and Q N is a just balance to the force, wherewith the\r\ncolumn between L O and M N endeavours to extend. So the part L M of\r\nthe bottom, which sustains both this force and the weight of the water\r\nbetween L O and M N, is pressed upon by a force equal to the united\r\nweight of the water between L O and M N, and the weight of the water\r\nbetween P O and Q N; that is, it is pressed on by a force equal to the\r\nweight of all the water contained between L P and M Q. And this weight\r\nis equal to that of the water contained between G I and H K, which is\r\nthe weight sustained by the part G H of the bottom. Now this being\r\ntrue of every part of the bottom B C, it is evident, that if another\r\nvessel R S T V be formed with a bottom R V equal to the bottom B C, and\r\nbe throughout its whole height of one and the same breadth; when this\r\nvessel is filled with water to the same height, as the vessel A B C D\r\nis filled, the bottoms of these two vessels shall be pressed upon with\r\nequal force. If the vessel be broader at the top than at the bottom,\r\nit is evident, that the bottom will bear the pressure of so much of\r\nthe fluid, as is perpendicularly over it, and the sides of the vessel\r\nwill support the rest. This property of fluids is a corollary from a\r\nproposition of our author[263]; from whence also he deduces the effects\r\nof the pressure of fluids on bodies resting in them. These are, that\r\nany body heavier than a fluid will sink to the bottom of the vessel,\r\nwherein the fluid is contained, and in the fluid will weigh as much as\r\nits own weight exceeds the weight of an equal quantity of the fluid;\r\nany body uncompressible of the same density with the fluid, will rest\r\nany where in the fluid without suffering the least change either in\r\nits place or figure from the pressure of such a fluid, but will remain\r\nas undisturbed as the parts of the fluid themselves; but every body\r\nof less density than the fluid will swim on its surface, a part only\r\nbeing received within the fluid. Which part will be equal in bulk to\r\na quantity of the fluid, whose weight is equal to the weight of the\r\nwhole body; for by this means the parts of the fluid under the body\r\nwill suffer as great a pressure as any other parts of the fluid as much\r\nbelow the surface as these.\r\n\r\n3. IN the next place, in relation to the air, we have above made\r\nmention, that the air surrounding the earth being an elastic fluid,\r\nthe power of gravity will have this effect on it, to make the lower\r\nparts near the surface of the earth more compact and compressed\r\ntogether by the weight of the air incumbent, than the higher parts,\r\nwhich are pressed upon by a less quantity of the air, and therefore\r\nsustain a less weight[264]. It has been also observed, that our author\r\nhas laid down a rule for computing the exact degree of density in\r\nthe air at all heights from the earth[265]. But there is a farther\r\neffect from the air’s being compressed by the power of gravity, which\r\nhe has distinctly considered. The air being elastic and in a state\r\nof compression, any tremulous body will propagate its motion to the\r\nair, and excite therein vibrations, which will spread from the body\r\nthat occasions them to a great distance. This is the efficient cause\r\nof sound: for that sensation is produced by the air, which, as it\r\nvibrates, strikes against the organ of hearing. As this subject was\r\nextremely difficult, so our great author’s success is surprizing.\r\n\r\n4. OUR author’s doctrine upon this head I shall endeavour to explain\r\nsomewhat at large. But preliminary thereto must be shewn, what he has\r\ndelivered in general of pressure propagated through fluids; and also\r\nwhat he has set down relating to that wave-like motion, which appears\r\nupon the surface of water, when agitated by throwing any thing into it,\r\nor by the reciprocal motion of the finger, &c.\r\n\r\n5. CONCERNING the first, it is proved, that pressure is spread\r\nthrough fluids, not only right forward in a streight line, but also\r\nlaterally, with almost the same ease and force. Of which a very obvious\r\nexemplification by experiment is proposed: that is, to agitate the\r\nsurface of water by the reciprocal motion of the finger forwards and\r\nbackwards only; for though the finger have no circular motion given\r\nit, yet the waves excited in the water will diffuse themselves on each\r\nhand of the direction of the motion, and soon surround the finger. Nor\r\nis what we observe in sounds unlike to this, which do not proceed in\r\nstraight lines only, but are heard though a mountain intervene, and\r\nwhen they enter a room in any part of it, they spread themselves into\r\nevery corner; not by reflection from the walls, as some have imagined,\r\nbut as far as the sense can judge, directly from the place where they\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n6. HOW the waves are excited in the surface of stagnant water, may be\r\nthus conceived. Suppose in any place, the water raised above the rest\r\nin form of a small hillock; that water will immediately subside, and\r\nraise the circumambient water above the level of the parts more remote,\r\nto which the motion cannot be communicated under longer time. And\r\nagain, the water in subsiding will acquire, like all falling bodies, a\r\nforce, which will carry it below the level surface, till at length the\r\npressure of the ambient water prevailing, it will rise again, and even\r\nwith a force like to that wherewith it descended, which will carry it\r\nagain above the level. But in the mean time the ambient water before\r\nraised will subside, as this did, sinking below the level; and in so\r\ndoing, will not only raise the water, which first subsided, but also\r\nthe water next without itself. So that now beside the first hillock, we\r\nshall have a ring investing it, at some distance raised above the plain\r\nsurface likewise; and between them the water will be sunk below the\r\nrest of the surface. After this, the first hillock, and the new made\r\nannular rising, will descend; raising the water between them, which\r\nwas before depressed, and likewise the adjacent part of the surface\r\nwithout. Thus will these annular waves be successively spread more\r\nand more. For, as the hillock subsiding produces one ring, and that\r\nring subsiding raises again the hillock, and a second ring; so the\r\nhillock and second ring subsiding together raise the first ring, and\r\na third; then this first and third ring subsiding together raise the\r\nfirst hillock, the second ring, and a fourth; and so on continually,\r\ntill the motion by degrees ceases. Now it is demonstrated, that these\r\nrings ascend and descend in the manner of a pendulum; descending with\r\na motion continually accelerated, till they become even with the plain\r\nsurface of the fluid, which is half the space they descend; and then\r\nbeing retarded again by the same degrees as those, whereby they were\r\naccelerated, till they are depressed below the plain surface, as much\r\nas they were before raised above it: and that this augmentation and\r\ndiminution of their velocity proceeds by the same degrees, as that of\r\na pendulum vibrating in a cycloid, and whose length should be a fourth\r\npart of the distance between any two adjacent waves: and farther, that\r\na new ring is produced every time a pendulum, whose length is four\r\ntimes the former, that is, equal to the interval between the summits of\r\ntwo waves, makes one oscillation or swing[266].\r\n\r\n7. THIS now opens the way for understanding the motion consequent upon\r\nthe tremors of the air, excited by the vibrations of sonorous bodies:\r\nwhich we must conceive to be performed in the following manner.\r\n\r\n8. LET A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (in fig. 110.) represent a series of\r\nthe particles of the air, at equal distances from each other. I K L\r\na musical chord, which I shall use for the tremulous and sonorous\r\nbody, to make the conception as simple as may be. Suppose this chord\r\nstretched upon the points I and L, and forcibly drawn into the\r\nsituation I K L, so that it become contiguous to the particle A in its\r\nmiddle point K: and let the chord from this situation begin to recoil,\r\npressing against the particle A, which will thereby be put into motion\r\ntowards B: but the particles A, B, C being equidistant, the elastic\r\npower, by which B avoids A, is equal to, and balanced by the power, by\r\nwhich it avoids C; therefore the elastic force, by which B is repelled\r\nfrom A, will not put B into any degree of motion, till A is by the\r\nmotion of the chord brought nearer to B, than B is to C: but as soon as\r\nthat is done, the particle B will be moved towards C; and being made\r\nto approach C, will in the next place move that; which will upon that\r\nadvance, put D likewise into motion, and so on: therefore the particle\r\nA being moved by the chord, the following particles of the air B, C, D,\r\n&c. will successively be moved. Farther, if the point K of the chord\r\nmoves forward with an accelerated velocity, so that the particle A\r\nshall move against B with an advancing pace, and gain ground of it,\r\napproaching nearer and nearer continually; A by approaching will press\r\nmore upon B, and give it a greater velocity likewise, by reason that as\r\nthe distance between the particles diminishes, the elastic power, by\r\nwhich they fly each other, increases. Hence the particle B, as well as\r\nA, will have its motion gradually accelerated, and by that means will\r\nmore and more approach to C. And from the same cause C will more and\r\nmore approach D; and so of the rest. Suppose now, since the agitation\r\nof these particles has been shewn to be successive, and to follow one\r\nanother, that E be the remotest particle moved, while the chord is\r\nmoving from its curve situation I K L into that of a streight line, as\r\nI k L; and F the first which remains unaffected, though just upon the\r\npoint of being put into motion. Then shall the particles A, B, C, D,\r\nE, F, G, when the point K is moved into k, have acquired the rangement\r\nrepresented by the adjacent points _a, b, c, d, e, f, g_: in which _a_\r\nis nearer to _b_ than _b_ to _c_, and _b_ nearer to _c_ than _c_ to\r\n_d_, and _c_ nearer to _d_ than _d_ to _e_ and _d_ nearer to _e_ than\r\n_e_ to _f_, and lastly _e_ nearer to _f_ than _f_ to _g_.\r\n\r\n9. BUT now the chord having recovered its rectilinear situation I k L,\r\nthe following motion will be changed, for the point K, which before\r\nadvanced with a motion more and more accelerated, though by the force\r\nit has acquired it will go on to move the same way as before, till it\r\nhas advanced near as far forwards, as it was at first drawn backwards;\r\nyet the motion of it will henceforth be gradually lessened. The effect\r\nof which upon the particles _a, b, c, d, e, f, g_ will be, that by the\r\ntime the chord has made its utmost advance, and is upon the return,\r\nthese particles will be put into a contrary rangement; so that _f_\r\nshall be nearer to _g_, than _e_ to _f_, and _e_ nearer to _f_ than _d_\r\nto _e_; and the like of the rest, till you come to the first particles\r\n_a_, _b_, whose distance will then be nearly or quite what it was at\r\nfirst. All which will appear as follows. The present distance between\r\n_a_ and _b_ is such, that the elastic power, by which _a_ repels _b_,\r\nis strong enough to maintain that distance, though a advance with the\r\nvelocity, with which the string resumes its rectilinear figure; and\r\nthe motion of the particle _a_ being afterwards slower, the present\r\nelasticity between _a_ and _b_ will be more than sufficient to preserve\r\nthe distance between them. Therefore while it accelerates _b_ it will\r\nretard _a_. The distance _b c_ will still diminish, till _b_ come about\r\nas near to _c_, as it is from a at present; for after the distances\r\n_a b_ and _b c_ are become equal, the particle _b_ will continue its\r\nvelocity superior to that of _c_ by its own power of inactivity, till\r\nsuch time as the increase of elasticity between _b_ and _c_ more than\r\nshall be between _a_ and _b_ shall suppress its motion: for as the\r\npower of inactivity in _b_ made a greater elasticity necessary on the\r\nside of a than on the side of _c_ to push _b_ forward, so what motion\r\n_b_ has acquired it will retain by the same power of inactivity, till\r\nit be suppressed by a greater elasticity on the side of _c_, than on\r\nthe side of _a_. But as soon as _b_ begins to slacken its pace the\r\ndistance of _b_ from c will widen as the distance _a b_ has already\r\ndone. Now as _a_ acts on _b_, so will _b_ on _c_, _c_ on _d_, &c. so\r\nthat the distances between all the particles _b, c, d, e, f, g_ will\r\nbe successively contracted into the distance of _a_ from _b_, and then\r\ndilated again. Now because the time, in which the chord describes\r\nthis present half of its vibration, is about equal to that it took up\r\nin describing the former; the particles _a_, _b_ will be as long in\r\ndilating their distance, as before in contracting it, and will return\r\nnearly to their original distance. And farther, the particles _b_, _c_,\r\nwhich did not begin to approach so soon as _a_, _b_, are now about as\r\nmuch longer, before they begin to recede; and likewise the particles\r\n_c_, _d_, which began to approach after _b_, _c_, begin to separate\r\nlater. Whence it appears that the particles, whose distance began to be\r\nlessened, when that of _a_, _b_ was first enlarged, viz. the particles\r\n_f_, _g,_ should be about their nearest distance, when _a_ and _b_ have\r\nrecovered their prime interval. Thus will the particles _a, b, c, d, e,\r\nf, g_ have changed their situation in the manner asserted. But farther,\r\nas the particles _f_, _g_ or F, G gradually approach each other, they\r\nwill move by degrees the succeeding particles to as great a length, as\r\nthe particles A, B did by a like approach. So that, when the chord has\r\nmade its greatest advance, being arrived into the situation I ϰ L, the\r\nparticles moved by it will have the rangement noted by the points α, β,\r\nγ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ. Where α, β are at the original distance\r\nof the particles in the line A H; ζ, η are the nearest of all, and the\r\ndistance ν χ is equal to that between α and β.\r\n\r\n10. BY this time the chord I ϰ L begins to return, and the distance\r\nbetween the particles α and β being enlarged to its original magnitude,\r\nα has lost all that force it had acquired by its motion, being now at\r\nrest; and therefore will return with the chord, making the distance\r\nbetween α and β greater than the natural; for β will not return so\r\nsoon, because its motion forward is not yet quite suppressed, the\r\ndistance β γ not being already enlarged to its prime dimension: but the\r\nrecess of α, by diminishing the pressure upon β by its elasticity, will\r\noccasion the motion of β to be stopt in a little time by the action of\r\nγ, and then shall β begin to return: at which time the distance between\r\nγ and δ shall by the superior action of δ above β be enlarged to the\r\ndimension of the distance β γ, and therefore soon after to that of α β.\r\nThus it appears, that each of these particles goes on to move forward,\r\ntill its distance from the preceding one be equal to its original\r\ndistance; the whole chain α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, having an undulating\r\nmotion forward, which is stopt gradually by the excess of the expansive\r\npower of the preceding parts above that of the hinder. Thus are these\r\nparts successively stopt, as before they were moved; so that when the\r\nchord has regained its rectilinear situation, the expansion of the\r\nparts of the air will have advanced so far, that the interval between\r\nζ η, which at present is most contracted, will then be restored to its\r\nnatural size: the distances between η and θ, θ and λ, λ and μ, μ and ν,\r\nν and χ, being successively contracted into the present distance of ζ\r\nfrom η, and again enlarged; so that the same effect shall be produced\r\nupon the parts beyond ζ η, by the enlargement of the distance between\r\nthose two particles, as was occasioned upon the particles α, β, γ, δ,\r\nε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, by the enlargement of the distance α β to its\r\nnatural extent. And therefore the motion in the air will be extended\r\nhalf as much farther as at present, and the distance between ν and χ\r\ncontracted into that, which is at present between ζ and η, all the\r\nparticles of the air in motion taking the rangement expressed in figure\r\n111. by the points α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, ϰ, ρ, σ, τ, φ\r\nwherein the particles from α to χ have their distances from each other\r\ngradually diminished, the distances between the particles ν, χ being\r\ncontracted the most from the natural distance between those particles,\r\nand the distance between α, β as much augmented, and the distance\r\nbetween the middle particles ζ, η becoming equal to the natural. The\r\nparticles π, ρ, ω τ, φ which follow χ, have their distances gradually\r\ngreater and greater, the particles ν, χ, π, ρ, σ, τ, φ being ranged\r\nlike the particles _a, b, c, d, e, f, g_, or like the particles ζ,\r\nη, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ in the former figure. Here it will be understood,\r\nby what has been before explained, that the particles ζ, η being at\r\ntheir natural distance from each other, the particle ζ is at rest, the\r\nparticles ε, δ, λ, β, ϰ between them and the string being in motion\r\nbackward, and the rest of the particles η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, π, ρ, σ, τ\r\nin motion forward: each of the particles between η and χ moving faster\r\nthan that, which immediately follows it; but of the particles from χ\r\nto φ, on the contrary, those behind moving on faster than those, which\r\nprecede.\r\n\r\n11. BUT now the string having recovered its rectilinear figure, though\r\nit shall go on recoiling, till it return near to its first situation\r\nI K L, yet there will be a change in its motion; so that whereas it\r\nreturned from the situation I ϰ L with an accelerated motion, its\r\nmotion shall from hence be retarded again by the same degrees, as\r\naccelerated before. The effect of which change upon the particles of\r\nthe air will be this. As by the accelerated motion of the chord α\r\ncontiguous to it moved faster than β, γ, so as to make the interval α\r\nβ greater than the interval β γ, and from thence β was made likewise\r\nto move faster than γ, and the distance between β and γ rendered\r\ngreater than the distance between γ and δ, and so of the rest; now the\r\nmotion of α being diminished, β shall overtake it, and the distance\r\nbetween α and β be reduced into that, which is at present between β\r\nand γ, the interval between β and γ being inlarged into the present\r\ndistance between α and β; but when the interval β γ is increased to\r\nthat, which is at present between α and β γ the distance between γ\r\nand δ shall be enlarged to the present distance between γ and β,\r\nand the distance between δ and ι inlarged into the present distance\r\nbetween γ and δ; and the same of the rest. But the chord more and more\r\nslackening its pace, the distance between α and β shall be more and\r\nmore diminished; and in consequence of that the distance between β and\r\nγ shall be again contracted, first into its present dimension, and\r\nafterwards into a narrower space; while the interval γ δ shall dilate\r\ninto that at present between α and β, and as soon as it is so much\r\nenlarged, it shall contract again. Thus by the reciprocal expansion\r\nand contraction of the air between α and ζ, by that time the chord is\r\ngot into the situation I K L, the interval ζ η shall be expanded into\r\nthe present distance between α and β; and by that time likewise the\r\npresent distance of α from β will be contracted into their natural\r\ninterval: for this distance will be about the same time in contracting\r\nit self, as has been taken up in its dilatation; seeing the string will\r\nbe as long in returning from its rectilinear figure, as it has been in\r\nrecovering it from its situation I ϰ L. This is the change which will\r\nbe made in the particles between α and ζ. As for those between ζ and\r\nχ, because each preceding particle advances faster than that, which\r\nimmediately follows it, their distances will successively be dilated\r\ninto that, which is at present between ζ and η. And as soon as any two\r\nparticles are arrived at their natural distance, the hindermost of them\r\nshall be stopt, and immediately after return, the distances between\r\nthe returning particles being greater than the natural. And this\r\ndilatation of these distances shall extend so far, by that time the\r\nchord is returned into its first situation I K L, that the particles ι\r\nχ shall be removed to their natural distance. But the dilatation of ν\r\nχ shall contract the interval τ φ into that at present between ν and\r\nχ, and the contraction of the distance between those two particles τ\r\nand φ will agitate a part of the air beyond; so that when the chord is\r\nreturned into the situation I K L, having made an intire vibration, the\r\nmoved particles of the air will take the rangement expressed by the\r\npoints, _l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, x, y, z_, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\n7, 8: in which _l m_, are at the natural distance of the particles, the\r\ndistance _m n_ greater than _l m_ and _n o_ greater than _m n_, and so\r\non, till you come to _q r_, the widest of all: and then the distances\r\ngradually diminish not only to the natural distance, as _w x_, but till\r\nthey are contracted as much as χ τ was before; which falls out in the\r\npoints 2, 3, from whence the distances augment again, till you come to\r\nthe part of the air untouched.\r\n\r\n12. THIS is the motion, into which the air is put, while the chord\r\nmakes one vibration, and the whole length of air thus agitated in\r\nthe time of one vibration of the chord our author calls the length\r\nof one pulse. When the chord goes on to make another vibration, it\r\nwill not only continue to agitate the air at present in motion, but\r\nspread the pulsation of the air as much farther, and by the same\r\ndegrees, as before. For when the chord returns into its rectilinear\r\nsituation I _k_ L, _l m_ shall be brought into its most contracted\r\nstate, _q r_ now in the state of greatest dilatation shall be reduced\r\nto its natural distance, the points _w_, _x_ now at their natural\r\ndistance shall be at their greatest distance, the points 2, 3 now most\r\ncontracted enlarged to their natural distance, and the points 7, 8\r\nreduced to their most contracted state: and the contraction of them\r\nwill carry the agitation of the air as far beyond them, as that motion\r\nwas carried from the chord, when it first moved out of the situation\r\nI K L into its rectilinear figure. When the chord is got into the\r\nsituation I ϰ L, _l m_ shall recover its natural dimensions, _q r_ be\r\nreduced to its state of greatest contraction, _w x_ brought to its\r\nnatural dimension, the distance 2 3 enlarged to the utmost, and the\r\npoints 7, 8 shall have recovered their natural distance; and by thus\r\nrecovering themselves they shall agitate the air to as great a length\r\nbeyond them, as it was moved beyond the chord, when it first came into\r\nthe situation I ϰ L. When the chord is returned back again into its\r\nrectilinear situation, _l m_ shall be in its utmost dilatation, _q r_\r\nrestored again to its natural distance, _w x_ reduced into its state of\r\ngreatest contraction, 2 3 shall recover its natural dimension, and 7 8\r\nbe in its state of greatest dilatation. By which means the air shall be\r\nmoved as far beyond the points 7, 8, as it was moved beyond the chord,\r\nwhen it before made its return back to its rectilinear situation; for\r\nthe particles 7, 8 have been changed from their state of rest and\r\ntheir natural distance into a state of contraction, and then have\r\nproceeded to the recovery of their natural distance, and after that to\r\na dilatation of it, in the same manner as the particles contiguous to\r\nthe chord were agitated before. In the last place, when the chord is\r\nreturned into the situation I K L, the particles of air from _l_ to δ\r\nshall acquire their present rangement, and the motion of the air be\r\nextended as much farther. And the like will happen after every compleat\r\nvibration of the string.\r\n\r\n13. CONCERNING this motion of sound, our author shews how to compute\r\nthe velocity thereof, or in what time it will reach to any proposed\r\ndistance from the sonorous body. For this he requires to know the\r\nheight of air, having the same density with the parts here at the\r\nsurface of the earth, which we breath, that would be equivalent in\r\nweight to the whole incumbent atmosphere. This is to be found by the\r\nbarometer, or common weatherglass. In that instrument quicksilver is\r\nincluded in a hollow glass cane firmly closed at the top. The bottom is\r\nopen, but immerged into quicksilver contained in a vessel open to the\r\nair. Care is taken when the lower end of the cane is immerged, that the\r\nwhole cane be full of quicksilver, and that no air insinuate itself.\r\nWhen the instrument is thus fixed, the quicksilver in the cane being\r\nhigher than that in the vessel, if the top of the cane were open, the\r\nfluid would soon sink out of the glass cane, till it came to a level\r\nwith that in the vessel. But the top of the cane being closed up, so\r\nthat the air, which has free liberty to press on the quicksilver in\r\nthe vessel, cannot bear at all on that, which is within the cane, the\r\nquicksilver in the cane will be suspended to such a height, as to\r\nbalance the pressure of the air on the quicksilver in the vessel. Here\r\nit is evident, that the weight of the quicksilver in the glass cane is\r\nequivalent to the pressure of so much of the air, as is perpendicularly\r\nover the hollow of the cane; for if the cane be opened that the air may\r\nenter, there will be no farther use of the quicksilver to sustain the\r\npressure of the air without; for the quicksilver in the cane, as has\r\nalready been observed, will then subside to a level with that without.\r\nHence therefore if the proportion between the density of quicksilver\r\nand of the air we breath be known, we may know what height of such air\r\nwould form a column equal in weight to the column of quicksilver within\r\nthe glass cane. When the quicksilver is sustained in the barometer\r\nat the height of 30 inches, the height of such a column of air will\r\nbe about 29725 feet; for in this case the air has about 1/870 of the\r\ndensity of water, and the density of quicksilver exceeds that of water\r\nabout 13⅔ times, so that the density of quicksilver exceeds that of the\r\nair about 11890 times; and so many times 30 inches make 29725 feet. Now\r\nSir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ determines, that while a pendulum of the length of\r\nthis column should make one vibration or swing, the space, which any\r\nsound will have moved, shall bear to this length the same proportion,\r\nas the circumference of a circle bears to the diameter thereof;\r\nthat is, about the proportion of 355 to 113[267]. Only our author\r\nhere considers singly the gradual progress of sound in the air from\r\nparticle to particle in the manner we have explained, without taking\r\ninto consideration the magnitude of those particles. And though there\r\nrequires time for the motion to be propagated from one particle to\r\nanother, yet it is communicated to the whole of the same particle in an\r\ninstant: therefore whatever proportion the thickness of these particles\r\nbears to their distance from each other, in the same proportion will\r\nthe motion of sound be swifter. Again the air we breath is not simply\r\ncomposed of the elastic part, by which sound is conveyed, but partly of\r\nvapours, which are of a different nature; and in the computation of the\r\nmotion of sound we ought to find the height of a column of this pure\r\nair only, whose weight should be equal to the weight of the quicksilver\r\nin the cane of the barometer, and this pure air being a part only of\r\nthat we breath, the column of this pure air will be higher than 29725\r\nfeet. On both these accounts the motion of sound is found to be about\r\n1142 feet in one second of time, or near 13 miles in a minute, whereas\r\nby the computation proposed above, it should move but 979 feet in one\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n14. WE may observe here, that from these demonstrations of our author\r\nit follows, that all sounds whether acute or grave move equally swift,\r\nand that sound is swiftest, when the quicksilver stands highest in the\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\n15. THUS much of the appearances, which are caused in these fluids from\r\ntheir gravitation toward the earth. They also gravitate toward the\r\nmoon; for in the last chapter it has been proved, that the gravitation\r\nbetween the earth and moon is mutual, and that this gravitation of\r\nthe whole bodies arises from that power acting in all their parts; so\r\nthat every particle of the moon gravitates toward the earth, and every\r\nparticle of the earth toward the moon. But this gravitation of these\r\nfluids toward the moon produces no sensible effect, except only in the\r\nsea, where it causes the tides.\r\n\r\n16. THAT the tides depend upon the influence of the moon has been the\r\nreceiv’d opinion of all antiquity; nor is there indeed the least shadow\r\nof reason to suppose otherwise, considering how steadily they accompany\r\nthe moon’s course. Though how the moon caused them, and by what\r\nprinciple it was enabled to produce so distinguish’d an appearance,\r\nwas a secret left for this philosophy to unfold: which teaches, that\r\nthe moon is not here alone concerned, but that the sun likewise has a\r\nconsiderable share in their production; though they have been generally\r\nascribed to the other luminary, because its effect is greatest, and by\r\nthat means the tides more immediately suit themselves to its motion;\r\nthe sun discovering its influence more by enlarging or restraining the\r\nmoon’s power, than by any distinct effects. Our author finds the power\r\nof the moon to bear to the power of the sun about the proportion of\r\n4½ to 1. This he deduces from the observations made at the mouth of\r\nthe river Avon, three miles from Bristol, by Captain STURMEY, and at\r\nPlymouth by Mr. COLEPRESSE, of the height to which the water is raised\r\nin the conjunction and opposition of the luminaries, compared with the\r\nelevation of it, when the moon is in either quarter; the first being\r\ncaused by the united actions of the sun and moon, and the other by the\r\ndifference of them, as shall hereafter be shewn.\r\n\r\n17. THAT the sun should have a like effect on the sea, as the moon, is\r\nvery manifest; since the sun likewise attracts every single particle,\r\nof which this earth is composed. And in both luminaries since the power\r\nof gravity is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the distance,\r\nthey will not draw all the parts of the waters in the same manner;\r\nbut must act upon the nearest parts stronger, than upon the remotest,\r\nproducing by this inequality an irregular motion. We shall now attempt\r\nto shew how the actions of the sun and moon on the waters, by being\r\ncombined together, produce all the appearances observed in the tides.\r\n\r\n18. TO begin therefore, the reader will remember what has been said\r\nabove, that if the moon without the sun would have described an orbit\r\nconcentrical to the earth, the action of the sun would make the orbit\r\noval, and bring the moon nearer to the earth at the new and full,\r\nthan at the quarters[268]. Now our excellent author observes, that\r\nif instead of one moon, we suppose a ring of moons, contiguous and\r\noccupying the whole orbit of the moon, his demonstration would still\r\ntake place, and prove that the parts of this ring in passing from the\r\nquarter to the conjunction or opposition would be accelerated, and be\r\nretarded again in passing from the conjunction or opposition to the\r\nnext quarter. And as this effect does not depend on the magnitude of\r\nthe bodies, whereof the ring is composed, the same would hold, though\r\nthe magnitude of these moons were so far to be diminished, and their\r\nnumber increased, till they should form a fluid[269]. Now the earth\r\nturns round continually upon its own center, causing thereby the\r\nalternate change of day and night, while by this revolution each part\r\nof the earth is successively brought toward the sun, and carried off\r\nagain in the space of 24 hours. And as the sea revolves round along\r\nwith the earth itself in this diurnal motion, it will represent in some\r\nsort such a fluid ring.\r\n\r\n19. BUT as the water of the sea does not move round with so much\r\nswiftness, as would carry it about the center of the earth in the\r\ncircle it now describes, without being supported by the body of the\r\nearth; it will be necessary to consider the water under three distinct\r\ncases. The first case shall suppose the water to move with the degree\r\nof swiftness, required to carry a body round the center of the\r\nearth disingaged from it in a circle at the distance of the earth’s\r\nsemidiameter, like another moon. The second case is, that the waters\r\nmake but one turn about the axis of the earth in the space of a month,\r\nkeeping pace with the moon; so that all parts of the water should\r\npreserve continually the same situation in respect of the moon. The\r\nthird case shall be the real one of the waters moving with a velocity\r\nbetween these two, neither so swift as the first case requires, nor so\r\nslow as the second.\r\n\r\n20. IN the first case the waters, like the body which they equalled\r\nin velocity, by the action of the moon would be brought nearer the\r\ncenter under and opposite to the moon, than in the parts in the middle\r\nbetween these eastward or westward. That such a body would so alter\r\nits distance by the moon’s action upon it, is clear from what has\r\nbeen mentioned of the like changes in the moon’s motion caused by\r\nthe sun[270]. And computation shews, that the difference between the\r\ngreatest and least distance of such a body would not be much above 4½\r\nfeet. But in the second case, where all the parts of the water preserve\r\nthe same situation continually in respect of the moon, the weight of\r\nthose parts under and opposite to the moon will be diminished by the\r\nmoon’s action, and the parts in the middle between these will have\r\ntheir weight increased: this being effected just in the same manner,\r\nas the sun diminishes the attraction of the moon towards the earth in\r\nthe conjunction and opposition, but increases that attraction in the\r\nquarters. For as the first of these consequences from the sun’s action\r\non the moon is occasioned by the moon’s being attracted by the sun in\r\nthe conjunction more than the earth, and in the opposition less than\r\nit, and therefore in the common motion of the earth and moon, the moon\r\nis made to advance toward the sun in one case too fast, and in the\r\nother is left as it were behind; so the earth will not have its middle\r\nparts drawn towards the moon so strongly as the nearer parts, and yet\r\nmore forcibly than the remotest: and therefore since the earth and\r\nmoon move each month round their common center of gravity[271], while\r\nthe earth moves round this center, the same effect will be produced,\r\non the parts of the water nearest to that center or to the moon, as\r\nthe moon feels from the sun when in conjunction, and the water on the\r\ncontrary side of the earth will be affected by the moon, as the moon is\r\nby the sun, when in opposition[272]; that is, in both cases the weight\r\nof the water, or its propensity towards the center of the earth, will\r\nbe diminished. The parts in the middle between these will have their\r\nweight increased, by being pressed towards the center of the earth\r\nthrough the obliquity of the moon’s action upon them to its action\r\nupon the earth’s center, just as the sun increases the gravitation\r\nof the moon in the quarters from the same cause[273]. But now it is\r\nmanifest, that where the weight of the same quantity of water is least,\r\nthere it will be accumulated; while the parts, which have the greatest\r\nweight, will subside. Therefore in this case there would be no tide or\r\nalternate rising and falling of the water, but the water would form it\r\nself into an oblong figure, whose axis prolonged would pass through the\r\nmoon. By Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~’s computation the excess of this axis above\r\nthe diameters perpendicular to it, that is, the height of the waters\r\nunder and opposite to the moon above their height in the middle between\r\nthese places eastward or westward caused by the moon, is about 8⅔ feet.\r\n\r\n21. THUS the difference of height in this latter supposition is little\r\nshort of twice that difference in the preceding. But the case of the\r\nsea is a middle between these two: for a body, which should revolve\r\nround the center of the earth at the distance of a semidiameter without\r\npressing on the earth’s surface, must perform its period in less than\r\nan hour and half, whereas the earth turns round but once in a day; and\r\nin the case of the waters keeping pace with the moon it should turn\r\nround but once in a month: so that the real motion of the water is\r\nbetween the motions required in these two cases. Again, if the waters\r\nmoved round as swiftly as the first case required, their weight would\r\nbe wholly taken off by their motion; for this case supposes the body\r\nto move so, as to be kept revolving in a circle round the earth by\r\nthe power of gravity without pressing on the earth at all, so that\r\nits motion just supports its weight. But if the power of gravity had\r\nbeen only 1/289 part of what it is, the body could have moved thus\r\nwithout pressing on the earth, and have been as long in moving round,\r\nas the earth it self is. Consequently the motion of the earth takes off\r\nfrom the weight of the water in the middle between the poles, where\r\nits motion is swiftest, 1/289 part of its weight and no more. Since\r\ntherefore in the first case the weight of the waters must be intirely\r\ntaken off by their motion, and by the real motion of the earth they\r\nlose only 1/289 part thereof, the motion of the water will so little\r\ndiminish their weight, that their figure will much nearer resemble\r\nthe case of their keeping pace with the moon than the other. Upon\r\nthe whole, if the waters moved with the velocity necessary to carry\r\na body round the center of the earth at the distance of the earth’s\r\nsemidiameter without bearing on its surface, the water would be lowest\r\nunder the moon, and rise gradually as it moved on with the earth\r\neastward, till it came half way toward the place opposite to the moon;\r\nfrom thence it would subside again, till it came to the opposition,\r\nwhere it would become as low as at first; afterwards it would rise\r\nagain, till it came half way to the place under the moon; and from\r\nhence it would subside, till it came a second time under the moon. But\r\nin case the water kept pace with the moon, it would be highest where\r\nin the other case it is lowest, and lowest where in the other it is\r\nhighest; therefore the diurnal motion of the earth being between the\r\nmotions of these two cases, it will cause the highest place of the\r\nwater to fall between the places of the greatest height in these two\r\ncases. The water as it passes from under the moon shall for some time\r\nrise, but descend again before it arrives half way to the opposite\r\nplace, and shall come to its least height before it becomes opposite\r\nto the moon; then it shall rise again, continuing so to do till it has\r\npassed the place opposite to the moon, but subside before it comes\r\nto the middle between the places opposite to and under the moon; and\r\nlastly it shall come to its lowest, before it comes a second time\r\nunder the moon. If A (in fig. 112, 113, 114.) represent the moon, B\r\nthe center of the earth, the oval C D E F in fig. 112. will represent\r\nthe situation of the water in the first case; but if the water kept\r\npace with the moon, the line C D E F in fig. 113. would represent\r\nthe situation of the water; but the line C D E F in fig. 114. will\r\nrepresent the same in the real motion of the water, as it accompanies\r\nthe earth in its diurnal rotation: in all these figures C and E being\r\nthe places where the water is lowest, and D and F the places where it\r\nis highest. Pursuant to this determination it is found, that on the\r\nshores, which lie exposed to the open sea, the high water usually falls\r\nout about three hours after the moon has passed the meridian of each\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n22. LET this suffice in general for explaining the manner, in which the\r\nmoon acts upon the seas. It is farther to be noted, that these effects\r\nare greatest, when the moon is over the earth’s equator[274], that\r\nis, when it shines perpendicularly upon the parts of the earth in the\r\nmiddle between the poles. For if the moon were placed over either of\r\nthe poles, it could have no effect upon the water to make it ascend and\r\ndescend. So that when the moon declines from the equator toward either\r\npole, it’s action must be something diminished, and that the more, the\r\nfarther it declines. The tides likewise will be greatest, when the moon\r\nis nearest to the earth, it’s action being then the strongest.\r\n\r\n23. THUS much of the action of the moon. That the sun should produce\r\nthe very same effects, though in a less degree, is too obvious to\r\nrequire a particular explanation: but as was remarked before, this\r\naction of the sun being weaker than that of the moon, will cause the\r\ntides to follow more nearly the moon’s course, and principally shew it\r\nself by heightening or diminishing the effects of the other luminary.\r\nWhich is the occasion, that the highest tides are found about the\r\nconjunction and opposition of the luminaries, being then produced by\r\ntheir united action, and the weakest tides about the quarters of the\r\nmoon; because the moon in this case raising the water where the sun\r\ndepresses it, and depressing it where the sun raises it, the stronger\r\naction of the moon is in part retunded and weakened by that of the sun.\r\nOur author computes that the sun will add near two feet to the height\r\nof the water in the first case, and in the other take from it as much.\r\nHowever the tides in both comply with the same hour of the moon. But at\r\nother times, between the conjunction or opposition and quarters, the\r\ntime deviates from that forementioned, towards the hour in which the\r\nsun would make high water, though still it keeps much nearer to the\r\nmoon’s hour than to the sun’s.\r\n\r\n24. AGAIN the tides have some farther varieties from the situation of\r\nthe places where they happen northward or southward. Let _p_ P (in fig.\r\n115.) represent the axis, on which the earth daily revolves, let _h_\r\n_p_ H P represent the figure of the water, and let _n_ B N D be a globe\r\ninscribed within this figure. Suppose the moon to be advanced from the\r\nequator toward the north pole, so that _h_ H the axis of the figure of\r\nthe water _p_ A H P E _h_ shall decline towards the north pole N; take\r\nany place G nearer to the north pole than to the south, and from the\r\ncenter of the earth C draw C G F; then will G F denote the altitude\r\nto which the water is raised by the tide, when the moon is above the\r\nhorizon: in the space of twelve hours, the earth having turned half\r\nround its axis, the place G will be removed to _g_; but the axis _h_\r\nH will have kept its place preserving its situation in respect of the\r\nmoon, at least will have moved no more than the moon has done in that\r\ntime, which it is not necessary here to take into consideration. Now\r\nin this case the height of the water will be equal to _g_ _f_, which\r\nis not so great as G F. But whereas G F is the altitude at high water,\r\nwhen the moon is above the horizon, _g_ _f_ will be the altitude of the\r\nsame, when the moon is under the horizon. The contrary happens toward\r\nthe south pole, for K L is less than _k_ _l_. Hence is proved, that\r\nwhen the moon declines from the equator, in those places, which are on\r\nthe same side of the equator as the moon, the tides are greater, when\r\nthe moon is above the horizon, than when under it; and the contrary\r\nhappens on the other side of the equator.\r\n\r\n25. NOW from these principles may be explained all the known\r\nappearances in the tides; only by the assistance of this additional\r\nremark, that the fluctuating motion, which the water has in flowing\r\nand ebbing, is of a durable nature, and would continue for some time,\r\nthough the action of the luminaries should cease; for this prevents\r\nthe difference between the tide when the moon is above the horizon,\r\nand the tide when the moon is below it from being so great, as the\r\nrule laid down requires. This likewise makes the greatest tides not\r\nexactly upon the new and full moon, but to be a tide or two after; as\r\nat Bristol and Plymouth they are found the third after.\r\n\r\n26. THIS doctrine farther shews us, why not only the spring tides fall\r\nout about the new and full moon, and the neap tides about the quarters;\r\nbut likewise how it comes to pass, that the greatest spring tides\r\nhappen about the equinoxes; because the luminaries are then one of them\r\nover the equator, and the other not far from it. It appears too, why\r\nthe neap tides, which accompany these, are the least of all, for the\r\nsun still continuing over the equator continues to have the greatest\r\npower of lessening the moon’s action, and the moon in the quarters\r\nbeing far removed toward one of the poles, has its power thereby\r\nweakned.\r\n\r\n27. MOREOVER the action of the moon being stronger, when near the\r\nearth, than when more remote; if the moon, when new suppose, be at its\r\nnearest distance from the earth, it shall when at the full be farthest\r\noff; whence it is, that two of the very largest spring tides do never\r\nimmediately succeed each other.\r\n\r\n28. BECAUSE the sun in its passage from the winter solstice to the\r\nsummer recedes from the earth, and passing from the summer solstice\r\nto the winter approaches it, and is therefore nearer the earth before\r\nthe vernal equinox than after, but nearer after the autumnal equinox\r\nthan before; the greatest tides oftner precede the vernal equinox than\r\nfollow it, and in the autumnal equinox on the contrary they oftner\r\nfollow it than come before it.\r\n\r\n29. THE altitude, to which the water is raised in the open ocean,\r\ncorresponds very well to the forementioned calculations; for as it was\r\nshewn, that the water in spring tides should rise to the height of 10\r\nor 11 feet, and the neap tides to 6 or 7; accordingly in the Pacific,\r\nAtlantic and Ethiopic oceans in the parts without the tropics, the\r\nwater is observed to rise about 6, 9, 12 or 15 feet. In the Pacific\r\nocean this elevation is said to be greater than in the other, as it\r\nought to be by reason of the wide extent of that sea. For the same\r\nreason in the Ethiopic ocean between the tropics the ascent of the\r\nwater is less than without, by reason of the narrowness of the sea\r\nbetween the coasts of Africa and the southern parts of America. And\r\nislands in such narrow seas, if far from shore, have less tides than\r\nthe coasts. But now in those ports where the water flows in with great\r\nviolence upon fords and shoals, the force it acquires by that means\r\nwill carry it to a much greater height, so as to make it ascend and\r\ndescend to 30, 40 or even 50 feet and more; instances of which we have\r\nat Plymouth, and in the Severn near Chepstow; at St. Michael’s and\r\nAuranches in Normandy; at Cambay and Pegu in the East Indies.\r\n\r\n30. AGAIN the tides take a considerable time in passing through long\r\nstraits, and shallow places. Thus the tide, which is made on the west\r\ncoast of Ireland and on the coast of Spain at the third hour after the\r\nmoon’s coming to the meridian, in the ports eastward toward the British\r\nchannel falls out later, and as the flood passes up that channel still\r\nlater and later, so that the tide takes up full twelve hours in coming\r\nup to London bridge.\r\n\r\n31. IN the last place tides may come to the same port from different\r\nseas, and as they may interfere with each other, they will produce\r\nparticular effects. Suppose the tide from one sea come to a port at the\r\nthird hour after the moon’s passing the meridian of the place, but from\r\nanother sea to take up six hours more in its passage. Here one tide\r\nwill make high water, when by the other it should be lowest; so that\r\nwhen the moon is over the equator, and the two tides are equal, there\r\nwill be no rising and falling of the water at all; for as much as the\r\nwater is carried off by one tide, it will be supplied by the other.\r\nBut when the moon declines from the equator, the same way as the port\r\nis situated, we have shewn that of the two tides of the ocean, which\r\nare made each day, that tide, which is made when the moon is above the\r\nhorizon, is greater than the other. Therefore in this case, as four\r\ntides come to this port each day the two greatest will come on the\r\nthird, and on the ninth hour after the moon’s passing the meridian, and\r\nthe two least at the fifteenth and at the twenty first hour. Thus from\r\nthe third to the ninth hour more water will be in this port by the two\r\ngreatest tides than from the ninth to the fifteenth, or from the twenty\r\nfirst to the following third hour, where the water is brought by one\r\ngreat and one small tide; but yet there will be more water brought\r\nby these tides, than what will be found between the two least tides,\r\nthat is, between the fifteenth and twenty first hour. Therefore in the\r\nmiddle between the third and ninth hour, or about the moon’s setting,\r\nthe water will be at its greatest height; in the middle between the\r\nninth and fifteenth, as also between the twenty first and following\r\nthird hour it will have its mean height; and be lowest in the middle\r\nbetween the fifteenth and twenty first hour, that is, at the moon’s\r\nrising. Thus here the water will have but one flood and one ebb each\r\nday. When the moon is on the other side of the equator, the flood will\r\nbe turned into ebb, and the ebb into flood; the high water falling\r\nout at the rising of the moon, and the low water at the setting. Now\r\nthis is the case of the port of Batsham in the kingdom of Tunquin in\r\nthe East Indies; to which port there are two inlets, one between the\r\ncontinent and the islands which are called the Manillas, and the other\r\nbetween the continent and Borneo.\r\n\r\n32. THE next thing to be considered is the effect, which these fluids\r\nof the planets have upon the solid part of the bodies to which they\r\nbelong. And in the first place I shall shew, that it was necessary upon\r\naccount of these fluid parts to form the bodies of the planets into a\r\nfigure something different from that of a perfect globe. Because the\r\ndiurnal rotation, which our earth performs about its axis, and the\r\nlike motion we see in some of the other planets, (which is an ample\r\nconviction that they all do the like) will diminish the force, with\r\nwhich bodies are attracted upon all the parts of their surfaces, except\r\nat the very poles, upon which they turn. Thus a stone or other weighty\r\nsubstance resting upon the surface of the earth, by the force which it\r\nreceives from the motion communicated to it by the earth, if its weight\r\nprevented not, would continue that motion in a straight line from the\r\npoint where it received it, and according to the direction, in which it\r\nwas given, that is, in a line which touches the surface at that point;\r\ninsomuch that it would move off from the earth in the same manner, as\r\na weight fasten’d to a string and whirled about endeavours continually\r\nto recede from the center of motion, and would forthwith remove it self\r\nto a greater distance from it, if loosed from the string which retains\r\nit. And farther, as the centrifugal force, with which such a weight\r\npresses from the center of its motion, is greater, by how much greater\r\nthe velocity is, with which it moves; so such a body, as I have been\r\nsupposing to lie on the earth, would recede from it with the greater\r\nforce, the greater the velocity is, with which the part of the earth’s\r\nsurface it rests upon is moved, that is, the farther distant it is from\r\nthe poles. But now the power of gravity is great enough to prevent\r\nbodies in any part of the earth from being carried off from it by this\r\nmeans; however it is plain that bodies having an effort contrary to\r\nthat of gravity, though much weaker than it, their weight, that is,\r\nthe degree of force, with which they are pressed to the earth, will\r\nbe diminished thereby, and be the more diminished, the greater this\r\ncontrary effort is; or in other words, the same body will weigh heavier\r\nat either of the poles, than upon any other part of the earth; and if\r\nany body be removed from the pole towards the equator, it will lose of\r\nits weight more and more, and be lightest of all at the equator, that\r\nis, in the middle between the poles.\r\n\r\n33. THIS now is easily applied to the waters of the seas, and shews\r\nthat the water under the poles will press more forcibly to the earth,\r\nthan at or near the equator: and consequently that which presses\r\nleast, must give place, till by ascending it makes room for receiving\r\na greater quantity, which by its additional weight may place the whole\r\nupon a ballance. To illustrate this more particularly I shall make\r\nuse of fig. 116 In which let A C B D be a circle, by whose revolution\r\nabout the diameter A B a globe should be formed, representing a globe\r\nof solid earth. Suppose this globe covered on all sides with water to\r\nthe same height, suppose that of E A or B F, at which distance the\r\ncircle E G F H surrounds the circle A C B D; then it is evident, if the\r\nglobe of earth be at rest, the water which surrounds it will rest in\r\nthat situation. But if the globe be turned incessantly about its axis\r\nA B, and the water have likewise the same motion, it is also evident,\r\nfrom what has been explained, that the water between the circles E H\r\nF G and A D B C will remain no longer in the present situation, the\r\nparts of it between H and D, and between G and C being by this rotation\r\nbecome lighter, than the parts between E and A and between B and F; so\r\nthat the water over the poles A and B must of necessity subside, and\r\nthe water be accumulated over D and C, till the greater quantity in\r\nthese latter places supply the defect of its weight. This would be the\r\ncase, were the globe all covered with water. And the same figure of the\r\nsurface would also be preserved, if some part of the water adjoining\r\nto the globe in any part of it were turned into solid earth, as is too\r\nevident to need any proof; because the parts of the water remaining\r\nat rest, it is the same thing, whether they continue in the state of\r\nbeing easily separable, which denominates them fluid, or were to be\r\nconsolidated together, so as to make a hard body: and this, though the\r\nwater should in some places be thus consolidated, even to the surface\r\nof it. Which shews that the form of the solid part of the earth makes\r\nno alteration in the figure the water will take: and by consequence in\r\norder to the preventing some parts of the earth from being entirely\r\noverflowed, and other parts quite deserted, the solid parts of the\r\nearth must have given them much the same figure, as if the whole earth\r\nwere covered on all sides with water.\r\n\r\n34. FARTHER, I say, this figure of the earth is the same, as it would\r\nreceive, were it entirely a globe of water, provided that water were of\r\nthe same density as the substance of the globe. For suppose the globe A\r\nC B D to be liquified, and that the globe E H F G, now entirely water,\r\nby its rotation about its axis should receive such a figure as we have\r\nbeen describing, and then the globe A C B D should be consolidated\r\nagain, the figure of the water would plainly not be altered, by such a\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\n35. BUT from this last observation our author is enabled to determine\r\nthe proportion between the axis of the earth drawn from pole to pole,\r\nand the diameter of the equator, upon the supposition that all the\r\nparts of the earth are of equal density; which he does by computing in\r\nthe first place the proportion of the centrifugal force of the parts\r\nunder the equator to the power of gravity; and then by considering\r\nthe earth as a spheroid, made by the revolution of an ellipsis about\r\nits lesser axis, that is, supposing the line M I L K to be an exact\r\nellipsis, from which it can differ but little, by reason that the\r\ndifference between the lesser axis M L and the greater I K is but very\r\nsmall. From this supposition, and what was proved before, that all the\r\nparticles which compose the earth have the attracting power explained\r\nin the preceding chapter, he finds at what distance the parts under the\r\nequator ought to be removed from the center, that the force, with which\r\nthey shall be attracted to the center, diminished by their centrifugal\r\nforce, shall be sufficient to keep those parts in a ballance with those\r\nwhich lie under the poles. And upon the supposition of all the parts of\r\nthe earth having the same degree of density, the earth’s surface at the\r\nequator must be above 17 miles more distant from the center, than at\r\nthe poles[275].\r\n\r\n36. AFTER this it is shewn, from the proportion of the equatorial\r\ndiameter of the earth to its axis, how the same may be determined of\r\nany other planet, whose density in comparison of the density of the\r\nearth, and the time of its revolution about its axis, are known. And\r\nby the rule delivered for this, it is found, that the diameter of the\r\nequator in Jupiter should bear to its axis about the proportion of 10\r\nto 9[276], and accordingly this planet appears of an oval form to the\r\nastronomers. The most considerable effects of this spheroidical figure\r\nour author takes likewise into consideration; one of which is that\r\nbodies are not equally heavy in all distances from the poles; but near\r\nthe equator, where the distance from the center is greatest, they are\r\nlighter than towards the poles: and nearly in this proportion, that\r\nthe actual power, by which they are drawn to the center, resulting\r\nfrom the difference between their absolute gravity and centrifugal\r\nforce, is reciprocally as the distance from the center. That this may\r\nnot appear to contradict what has before been said of the alteration\r\nof the power of gravity, in proportion to the change of the distance\r\nfrom the center, it is proper carefully to remark, that our author\r\nhas demonstrated three things relating hereto: the first is, that\r\ndecrease of the power of gravity as we recede from the center, which\r\nhas been fully explained in the last chapter, upon supposition that\r\nthe earth and planets are perfect spheres, from which their difference\r\nis by many degrees too little to require notice for the purposes there\r\nintended: the next is, that whether they be perfect spheres, or exactly\r\nsuch spheroids as have now been mentioned, the power of gravity, as\r\nwe descend in the same line to the center, is at all distances as the\r\ndistance from the center, the parts of the earth above the body by\r\ndrawing the body towards them lessening its gravitation towards the\r\ncenter[277]; and both these assertions relate to gravity alone: the\r\nthird is what we mentioned in this place, that the actual force on\r\ndifferent parts of the surface, with which bodies are drawn to the\r\ncenter, is in the proportion here assigned[278].\r\n\r\n38. THE next effect of this figure of the earth is an obvious\r\nconsequence of the former: that pendulums of the same length do not in\r\ndifferent distances from the pole make their vibrations in the same\r\ntime; but towards the poles, where the gravity is strongest, they move\r\nquicker than near the equator, where they are less impelled to the\r\ncenter; and accordingly pendulums, that measure the same time by their\r\nvibrations, must be shorter near the poles than at a greater distance.\r\nBoth which deductions are found true in fact; of which our author has\r\nrecounted particularly several experiments, in which it was found, that\r\nclocks exactly adjusted to the true measure of time at Paris, when\r\ntransported nearer to the equator, became erroneous and moved too slow,\r\nbut were reduced to their true motion by contracting their pendulums.\r\nOur author is particular in remarking, how much they lost of their\r\nmotion, while the pendulums remained unaltered; and what length the\r\nobservers are said to have shortened them, to bring them to time. And\r\nthe experiments, which appear to be most carefully made, shew the earth\r\nto be raised in the middle between the poles, as much as our author\r\nfound it by his computation[279].\r\n\r\n39. THESE experiments on the pendulum our author has been very exact\r\nin examining, inquiring particularly how much the extension of the\r\nrod of the pendulum by the great heats in the torrid zone might make\r\nit necessary to shorten it. For by an experiment made by PICART, and\r\nanother made by DE LA HIRE, heat, though not very intense, was found\r\nto increase the length of rods of iron. The experiment of PICART was\r\nmade with a rod one foot long, which in winter, at the time of frost,\r\nwas found to increase in length by being heated at the fire. In the\r\nexperiment of DE LA HIRE a rod of six foot in length was found, when\r\nheated by the summer sun only, to grow to a greater length, than it\r\nhad in the aforesaid cold season. From which observations a doubt has\r\nbeen raised, whether the rod of the pendulums in the aforementioned\r\nexperiments was not extended by the heat of those warm climates to all\r\nthat excess of length, the observers found themselves obliged to lessen\r\nthem by. But the experiments now mentioned shew the contrary. For in\r\nthe first of them the rod of a foot long was lengthened no more than\r\n1/9 part of what the pendulum under the equator must be diminished;\r\nand therefore a rod of the length of the pendulum would not have been\r\nextended above ⅓ of that length. In the experiment of DE LA HIRE,\r\nwhere the heat was less, the rod of six foot long was extended no more\r\nthan 3/10 of what the pendulum must be shortened; so that a rod of the\r\nlength of the pendulum would not have gained above 3/20 or 1/7 of that\r\nlength. And the heat in this latter experiment, though less than in\r\nthe former, was yet greater than the rod of a pendulum can ordinarily\r\ncontract in the hottest country; for metals receive a great heat when\r\nexposed to the open sun, certainly much greater than that of a human\r\nbody. But pendulums are not usually so exposed, and without doubt in\r\nthese experiments were kept cool enough to appear so to the touch;\r\nwhich they would do in the hottest place, if lodged in the shade. Our\r\nauthor therefore thinks it enough to allow about 1/10 of the difference\r\nobserved upon account of the greater warmth of the pendulum.\r\n\r\n40. THERE is a third effect, which the water has on the earth by\r\nchanging its figure, that is taken notice of by our author; for\r\nthe explaining of which we shall first prove, that bodies descend\r\nperpendicularly to the surface of the earth in all places. The manner\r\nof collecting this from observation, is as follows. The surfaces of\r\nall fluids rest parallel to that part of the surface of the sea, which\r\nis in the same place with them, to the figure of which, as has been\r\nparticularly shewn, the figure of the whole earth is formed. For if\r\nany hollow vessel, open at the bottom, be immersed into the sea; it\r\nis evident, that the surface of the sea within the vessel will retain\r\nthe same figure it had, before the vessel inclosed it; since its\r\ncommunication with the external water is not cut off by the vessel.\r\nBut all the parts of the water being at rest, it is as clear, that if\r\nthe bottom of the vessel were closed, the figure of the water could\r\nreceive no change thereby, even though the vessel were raised out of\r\nthe sea; any more than from the insensible alteration of the power of\r\ngravity, consequent upon the augmentation of the distance from the\r\ncenter. But now it is clear, that bodies descend in lines perpendicular\r\nto the surfaces of quiescent fluids; for if the power of gravity did\r\nnot act perpendicularly to the surface of fluids, bodies which swim on\r\nthem could not rest, as they are seen to do; because, if the power of\r\ngravity drew such bodies in a direction oblique to the surface whereon\r\nthey lay, they would certainly be put in motion, and be carried to the\r\nside of the vessel, in which the fluid was contained, that way the\r\naction of gravity inclined.\r\n\r\n41. HENCE it follows, that as we stand, our bodies are perpendicular\r\nto the surface of the earth. Therefore in going from north to south\r\nour bodies do not keep in a parallel direction. Now in all distances\r\nfrom the pole the same length gone on the earth will not make the same\r\nchange in the position of our bodies, but the nearer we are to the\r\npoles, we must go greater length to cause the same variation herein.\r\nLet M I L K (in fig. 117) represent the figure of the earth, M, L the\r\npoles, I, K two opposite points in the middle between these poles. Let\r\nT V and P O be two arches, T V being most remote from the pole L; draw\r\nT W, V X, P Q, O R, each perpendicular to the surface of the earth,\r\nand let T W, V X meet in Y, and P Q, O R in S. Here it is evident,\r\nthat in passing from V to T the position of a man’s body would be\r\nchanged by the angle under T Y V, for at V he would stand in the line\r\nY V continued upward, and at T in the line Y T; but in passing from O\r\nto P the position of his body would be changed by the angle under O\r\nS P. Now I say, if these two angles are equal the arch O P is longer\r\nthan T V: for the figure M I L K being oblong, and I K longer than M L,\r\nthe figure will be more incurvated toward I than toward L; so that the\r\nlines T W and V X will meet in Y before they are drawn out to so great\r\na length as the lines P Q and O R must be continued to, before they\r\nwill meet in S. Since therefore Y T and Y V are shorter than P S and S\r\nV, T V must be less than O P. If these angles under T Y V and O S P are\r\neach 1/90 part of the angle made by a perpendicular line, they are said\r\neach to contain one degree. And the unequal length of these arches O P\r\nand V T gives occasion to the assertion, that in passing from north to\r\nsouth the degrees on the earth’s surface are not of an equal length,\r\nbut those near the pole longer than those toward the equator. For the\r\nlength of the arch on the earth lying between the two perpendiculars,\r\nwhich make an angle of a degree with each other, is called the length\r\nof a degree on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n42. THIS figure of the earth has some effect on eclipses. It has been\r\nobserved above, that sometimes the nodes of the moon’s orbit lie in a\r\nstraight line drawn from the sun to the earth; in which case the moon\r\nwill cross the plane of the earth’s motion at the new and full. But\r\nwhenever the moon passes near the plane at the full, some part of the\r\nearth will intercept the sun’s light, and the moon shining only with\r\nlight borrow’d from the sun, when that light is prevented from falling\r\non any part of the moon, so much of her body will be darkened. Also\r\nwhen the moon at the new is near the plane of the earth’s motion, the\r\ninhabitants on some part of the earth will see the moon come under\r\nthe sun, and the sun thereby be covered from them either wholly or in\r\npart. Now the figure, which we have shewn to belong to the earth, will\r\noccasion the shadow of the earth on the moon not to be perfectly round,\r\nbut cause the diameter from east to west to be somewhat longer than\r\nthe diameter from north to south. In eclipse of the sun this figure\r\nof the earth will make some little difference in the place, where the\r\nsun shall appear wholly or in any given part covered. Let A B C D (in\r\nfig. 118.) represent the earth, A C the axis whereon it turns daily,\r\nE the center. Let F A G C represent a perfect globe inscribed within\r\nthe earth. Let H I be a line drawn through the centers of the sun and\r\nmoon, crossing the surface of the earth in K, and the surface of the\r\nglobe inscribed in L. Draw E L, which will be perpendicular to the\r\nsurface of the globe in L: and draw likewise K M, so that it shall\r\nbe perpendicular to the surface of the earth in K. Now whereas the\r\neclipse would appear central at L, if the earth were the globe A G C\r\nF, and does really appear so at K; I say, the latitude of the place K\r\non the real earth is different from the latitude of the place L on the\r\nglobe F A G C. What is called the latitude of any place is determined\r\nby the angle which the line perpendicular to the surface of the earth\r\nat that place makes with the axis; the difference between this angle,\r\nand that made by a perpendicular line or square being called the\r\nlatitude of each place. But it might here be proved, that the angle\r\nwhich K M makes with M C is less, than the angle made between L E and\r\nE C: consequently the latitude of the place K is greater, than the\r\nlatitude, which the place L would have.\r\n\r\n43. THE next effect, which follows from this figure of the earth,\r\nis that gradual change in the distance of the fixed stars from the\r\nequinoctial points, which astronomers observe. But before this can be\r\nexplained, it is necessary to say something more particular, than has\r\nyet been done, concerning the manner of the earth’s motion round the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n44. IT has already been said, that the earth turns round each day on\r\nits own axis, while its whole body is carried round the sun once in a\r\nyear. How these two motions are joined together may be conceived in\r\nsome degree by the motion of a bowl on the ground, where the bowl in\r\nrouling on continually turns upon its axis, and at the same time the\r\nwhole body thereof is carried straight on. But to be more express let\r\nA (in fig. 119) represent the sun B C D E four different situations\r\nof the earth in its orbit moving about the sun. In all these let F\r\nG represent the axis, about which the earth daily turns. The points\r\nF, G are called the poles of the earth; and this axis is supposed to\r\nkeep always parallel to it self in every situation of the earth; at\r\nleast that it would do so, were it not for a minute deviation, the\r\ncause whereof will be explained in what follows. When the earth is in\r\nB, the half H I K will be illuminated by the sun, and the other half\r\nH L K will be in darkness. Now if on the globe any point be taken in\r\nthe middle between the poles, this point shall describe by the motion\r\nof the globe the circle M N, half of which is in the enlightened part\r\nof the globe, and half in the dark part. But the earth is supposed to\r\nmove round its axis with an equable motion; therefore on this point of\r\nthe globe the sun will be seen just half the day, and be invisible the\r\nother half. And the same will happen to every point of this circle, in\r\nall situations of the earth during its whole revolution round the sun.\r\nThis circle M N is called the equator, of which we have before made\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n45. NOW suppose any other point taken on the surface of the globe\r\ntoward the pole F, which in the diurnal revolution of the globe\r\nshall describe the circle O P. Here it appears that more than half\r\nthis circle is enlightned by the sun, and consequently that in any\r\nparticular point of this circle the sun will be longer seen than\r\nlie hid, that is the day will be longer than the night. Again if we\r\nconsider the same circle O P on the globe situated in D the opposite\r\npart of the orbit from B, we shall see, that here in any place of this\r\ncircle the night will be as much longer than the day.\r\n\r\n46. IN these situations of the globe of earth a line drawn from the\r\nsun to the center of the earth will be obliquely inclined toward the\r\naxis F G. Now suppose, that such a line drawn from the sun to the\r\ncenter of the earth, when in C or E, would be perpendicular to the\r\naxis F G; in which cases the sun will shine perpendicularly upon the\r\nequator, and consequently the line drawn from the center of the earth\r\nto the sun will cross the equator, as it passes through the surface\r\nof the earth; whereas in all other situations of the globe this line\r\nwill pass through the surface of the globe at a distance from the\r\nequator either northward or southward. Now in both these cases half the\r\ncircle O P will be in the light, and half in the dark; and therefore\r\nto every place in this circle the day will be equal to the night. Thus\r\nit appears, that in these two opposite situations of the earth the\r\nday is equal to the night in all parts of the globe; but in all other\r\nsituations this equality will only be found in places situated in the\r\nvery middle between the poles, that is, on the equator.\r\n\r\n47. THE times, wherein this universal equality between the day and\r\nnight happens, are called the equinoxes. Now it has been long observed\r\nby astronomers, that after the earth hath set out from either equinox,\r\nsuppose from E (which will be the spring equinox, if F be the north\r\npole) the same equinox shall again return a little before the earth has\r\nmade a compleat revolution round the sun. This return of the equinox\r\npreceding the intire revolution of the earth is called the precession\r\nof the equinox, and is caused by the protuberant figure of the earth.\r\n\r\n49. SINCE the sun shines perpendicularly upon the equator, when the\r\nline drawn from the sun to the center of the earth is perpendicular to\r\nthe earth’s axis, in this case the plane, which should cut through\r\nthe earth at the equator, may be extended to pass through the sun;\r\nbut it will not do so in any other position of the earth. Now let us\r\nconsider the prominent part of the earth about the equator, as a solid\r\nring moving with the earth round the sun. At the time of the equinoxes,\r\nthis ring will have the same kind of situation in respect of the sun,\r\nas the orbit of the moon has, when the line of the nodes is directed\r\nto the sun; and at all other times will resemble the moon’s orbit in\r\nother situations. Consequently this ring, which otherwise would keep\r\nthroughout its motion parallel to it self, will receive some change in\r\nits position from the action of the sun upon it, except only at the\r\ntime of the equinox. The manner of this change may be understood as\r\nfollows. Let A B C D (in fig. 120) represent this ring, E the center of\r\nthe earth, S the sun, A F C G a circle described in the plane of the\r\nearth’s motion to the center E. Here A and C are the two points, in\r\nwhich the earth’s equator crosses the plane of the earth’s motion; and\r\nthe time of the equinox falls out, when the straight line A C continued\r\nwould pass through the sun. Now let us recollect what was said above\r\nconcerning the moon, when her orbit was in the same situation with this\r\nring. From thence it will be understood, if a body were supposed to\r\nbe moving in any part of this circle A B C D, what effect the action\r\nof the sun on the body would have toward changing the position of the\r\nline A C. In particular H I being drawn perpendicular to S E, if the\r\nbody be in any part of this circle between A and H, or between C and I,\r\nthe line A C would be so turned, that the point A shall move toward\r\nB, and the point C toward D; but if it were in any other part of the\r\ncircle, either between H and C, or between I and A, the line A C would\r\nbe turned the contrary way. Hence it follows, that as this solid ring\r\nturns round the center of the earth, the parts of this ring between A\r\nand H, and between C and I, are so influenced by the sun, that they\r\nwill endeavour, so to change the situation of the line A C as to cause\r\nthe point A to move toward B, and the point C to move toward D; but all\r\nthe parts of the ring between H and C, and between I and A, will have\r\nthe opposite tendency, and dispose the line A C to move the contrary\r\nway. And since these last named parts are larger than the other, they\r\nwill prevail over the other, so that by the action of the sun upon this\r\nring, the line A C will be so turned, that A shall continually be more\r\nand more moving toward D, and C toward B. Thus no sooner shall the sun\r\nin its visible motion have departed from A, but the motion of the line\r\nA C shall hasten its meeting with C, and from thence the motion of this\r\nline shall again hasten the sun’s second conjunction with A; for as\r\nthis line so turns, that A is continually moving toward D, so the sun’s\r\nvisible motion is the same way as from S toward T.\r\n\r\n49. THE moon will have on this ring the like effect as the sun, and\r\noperate on it more strongly, in the same proportion as its force on\r\nthe sea exceeded that of the sun on the same. But the effect of the\r\naction of both luminaries will be greatly diminished by reason of this\r\nring’s being connected to the rest of the earth; for by this means the\r\nsun and moon have not only this ring to move, but likewise the whole\r\nglobe of the earth, upon whose spherical part they have no immediate\r\ninfluence. Beside the effect is also rendred less, by reason that the\r\nprominent part of the earth is not collected all under the equator,\r\nbut spreads gradually from thence toward both poles. Upon the whole,\r\nthough the sun alone carries the nodes of the moon through an intire\r\nrevolution in about 19 years, the united force of both luminaries on\r\nthe prominent parts of the earth will hardly carry round the equinox in\r\na less space of time than 26000 years.\r\n\r\n50. TO this motion of the equinox we must add another consequence of\r\nthis action of the sun and moon upon the elevated parts of the earth,\r\nthat this annular part of the earth about the equator, and consequently\r\nthe earth’s axis, will twice a year and twice a month change its\r\ninclination to the plane of the earth’s motion, and be again restored,\r\njust as the inclination of the moon’s orbit by the action of the sun\r\nis annually twice diminished, and as often recovers its original\r\nmagnitude. But this change is very insensible.\r\n\r\n51. I SHALL now finish the present chapter with our great author’s\r\ninquiry into the figure of the secondary planets, particularly of our\r\nmoon, upon the figure of which its fluid parts will have an influence.\r\nThe moon turns always the same side towards the earth, and consequently\r\nrevolves but once round its axis in the space of an entire month; for\r\na spectator placed without the circle, in which the moon moves, would\r\nin that time observe all the parts of the moon successively to pass\r\nonce before his view and no more, that is, that the whole globe of the\r\nmoon has turned once round. Now the great slowness of this motion will\r\nrender the centrifugal force of the parts of the waters very weak, so\r\nthat the figure of the moon cannot, as in the earth, be much affected\r\nby this revolution upon its axis: but the figure of those waters are\r\nmade different from spherical by another cause, viz. the action of\r\nthe earth upon them; by which they will be reduced to an oblong oval\r\nform, whose axis prolonged would pass through the earth; for the same\r\nreason, as we have above observed, that the waters of the earth would\r\ntake the like figure, if they had moved so slowly, as to keep pace with\r\nthe moon. And the solid part of the moon must correspond with this\r\nfigure of the fluid part: but this elevation of the parts of the moon\r\nis nothing near so great as is the protuberance of the earth at the\r\nequator, for it will not exceed 93 english feet.\r\n\r\n52. The waters of the moon will have no tide, except what will arise\r\nfrom the motion of the moon round the earth. For the conversion of the\r\nmoon about her axis is equable, whereby the inequality in the motion\r\nround the earth discovers to us at some times small parts of the moon’s\r\nsurface towards the east or west, which at other times lie hid; and\r\nas the axis, whereon the moon turns, is oblique to her motion round\r\nthe earth, sometimes small parts of her surface toward the north, and\r\nsometimes the like toward the south are visible, which at other times\r\nare out of sight. These appearances make what is called the libration\r\nof the moon, discovered by HEVELIUS. But now as the axis of the oval\r\nfigure of the waters will he pointed towards the earth, there must\r\narise from hence some fluctuation in them; and beside, by the change of\r\nthe moon’s distance from the earth, they will not always have the very\r\nsame height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~BOOK III~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP~ I.\r\n\r\nConcerning the cause of COLOURS inherent in the LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER this view which has been taken of Sir ISAAC NEWTON’S mathematical\r\nprinciples of philosophy, and the use he has made of them, in\r\nexplaining the system of the world, &c. the course of my design directs\r\nus to turn our eyes to that other philosophical work, his treatise of\r\nOptics, in which we shall find our great author’s inimitable genius\r\ndiscovering it self no less, than in the former; nay perhaps even\r\nmore, since this work gives as many instances of his singular force\r\nof reasoning, and of his unbounded invention, though unassisted in\r\ngreat measure by those rules and general precepts, which facilitate\r\nthe invention of mathematical theorems. Nor yet is this work inferior\r\nto the other in usefulness; for as that has made known to us one great\r\nprinciple in nature, by which the celestial motions are continued, and\r\nby which the frame of each globe is preserved; so does this point out\r\nto us another principle no less universal, upon which depends all those\r\noperations in the smaller parts of matter, for whose sake the greater\r\nframe of the universe is erected; all those immense globes, with which\r\nthe whole heavens are filled, being without doubt only design’d as so\r\nmany convenient apartments for carrying on the more noble operations of\r\nnature in vegetation and animal life. Which single consideration gives\r\nabundant proof of the excellency of our author’s choice, in applying\r\nhimself carefully to examine the action between light and bodies, so\r\nnecessary in all the varieties of these productions, that none of them\r\ncan be successfully promoted without the concurrence of heat in a\r\ngreater or less degree.\r\n\r\n2. ’TIS true, our author has not made so full a discovery of the\r\nprinciple, by which this mutual action between light and bodies is\r\ncaused; as he has in relation to the power, by which the planets are\r\nkept in their courses: yet he has led us to the very entrance upon it,\r\nand pointed out the path so plainly which must be followed to reach it;\r\nthat one may be bold to say, whenever mankind shall be blessed with\r\nthis improvement of their knowledge, it will be derived so directly\r\nfrom the principles laid down by our author in this book, that the\r\ngreatest share of the praise due to the discovery will belong to him.\r\n\r\n3. IN speaking of the progress our author has made, I shall distinctly\r\npursue three things, the two first relating to the colours of natural\r\nbodies: for in the first head shall be shewn, how those colours are\r\nderived from the properties of the light itself; and in the second upon\r\nwhat properties of the bodies they depend: but the third head of my\r\ndiscourse shall treat of the action of bodies upon light in refracting,\r\nreflecting, and inflecting it.\r\n\r\n4. THE first of these, which shall be the business of the present\r\nchapter, is contained in this one proposition: that the sun’s direct\r\nlight is not uniform in respect of colour, not being disposed in every\r\npart of it to excite the idea of whiteness, which the whole raises; but\r\non the contrary is a composition of different kinds of rays, one sort\r\nof which if alone would give the sense of red, another of orange, a\r\nthird of yellow, a fourth of green, a fifth of light blue, a sixth of\r\nindigo, and a seventh of a violet purple; that all these rays together\r\nby the mixture of their sensations impress upon the organ of sight\r\nthe sense of whiteness, though each ray always imprints there its own\r\ncolour; and all the difference between the colours of bodies when\r\nviewed in open day light arises from this, that coloured bodies do not\r\nreflect all the sorts of rays falling upon them in equal plenty, but\r\nsome sorts much more copiously than others; the body appearing of that\r\ncolour, of which the light coming from it is most composed.\r\n\r\n5. THAT the light of the sun is compounded, as has been said, is proved\r\nby refracting it with a prism. By a prism I here mean a glass or other\r\nbody of a triangular form, such as is represented in fig. 121. But\r\nbefore we proceed to the illustration of the proposition we have just\r\nnow laid down, it will be necessary to spend a few words in explaining\r\nwhat is meant by the refraction of light; as the design of our present\r\nlabour is to give some notion of the subject, we are engaged in, to\r\nsuch as are not versed in the mathematics.\r\n\r\n6. IT is well known, that when a ray of light passing through the air\r\nfalls obliquely upon the surface of any transparent body, suppose water\r\nor glass, and enters it, the ray will not pass on in that body in the\r\nsame line it described through the air, but be turned off from the\r\nsurface, so as to be less inclined to it after passing it, than before.\r\nLet A B C D (in fig. 122.) represent a portion of water, or glass, A\r\nB the surface of it, upon which the ray of light E F falls obliquely;\r\nthis ray shall not go right on in the course delineated by the line\r\nF G, but be turned off from the surface A B into the line F H, less\r\ninclined to the surface A B than the line E F is, in which the ray is\r\nincident upon that surface.\r\n\r\n7. ON the other hand, when the light passes out of any such body into\r\nthe air, it is inflected the contrary way, being after its emergence\r\nrendred more oblique to the surface it passes through, than before.\r\nThus the ray F H, when it goes out of the surface C D, will be turned\r\nup towards that surface, going out into the air in the line H I.\r\n\r\n8. THIS turning of the light out of its way, as it passes from one\r\ntransparent body into another is called its refraction. Both these\r\ncases may be tried by an easy experiment with a bason and water. For\r\nthe first case set an empty bason in the sunshine or near a candle,\r\nmaking a mark upon the bottom at the extremity of the shadow cast\r\nby the brim of the bason, then by pouring water into the bason you\r\nwill observe the shadow to shrink, and leave the bottom of the bason\r\nenlightned to a good distance from the mark. Let A B C (in fig. 123.)\r\ndenote the empty bason, E A D the light shining over the brim of it,\r\nso that all the part A B D be shaded. Then a mark being made at D, if\r\nwater be poured into the bason (as in fig. 124.) to F G, you shall\r\nobserve the light, which before went on to D, now to come much short of\r\nthe mark D, falling on the bottom in the point H, and leaving the mark\r\nD a good way within the enlightened part; which shews that the ray E A,\r\nwhen it enters the water at I, goes no longer straight forwards, but is\r\nat that place incurvated, and made to go nearer the perpendicular. The\r\nother case may be tryed by putting any small body into an empty bason,\r\nplaced lower than your eye, and then receding from the bason, till you\r\ncan but just see the body over the brim. After which, if the bason be\r\nfilled with water, you shall presently observe the body to be visible,\r\nthough you go farther off from the bason. Let A B C (in fig. 125.)\r\ndenote the bason as before, D the body in it, E the place of your eye,\r\nwhen the body is seen just over the edge A, while the bason is empty.\r\nIf it be then filled with water, you will observe the body still to be\r\nvisible, though you take your eye farther off. Suppose you see the body\r\nin this case just over the brim A, when your eye is at F, it is plain\r\nthat the rays of light, which come from the body to your eye have not\r\ncome straight on, but are bent at A, being turned downwards, and more\r\ninclined to the surface of the water, between A and your eye at F, than\r\nthey are between A and the body D.\r\n\r\n9. THIS we hope is sufficient to make all our readers apprehend,\r\nwhat the writers of optics mean, when they mention the refraction\r\nof the light, or speak of the rays of light being refracted. We\r\nshall therefore now go on to prove the assertion advanced in the\r\nforementioned proposition, in relation to the different kinds of\r\ncolours, that the direct light of the sun exhibits to our sense: which\r\nmay be done in the following manner.\r\n\r\n10. IF a room be darkened, and the sun permitted to shine into it\r\nthrough a small hole in the window shutter, and be made immediately to\r\nfall upon a glass prism, the beam of light shall in passing through\r\nsuch a prism be parted into rays, which exhibit all the forementioned\r\ncolours. In this manner if A B (in fig. 126) represent the window\r\nshutter; C the hole in it; D E F the prism; Z Y a beam of light coming\r\nfrom the sun, which passes through the hole, and falls upon the prism\r\nat Y, and if the prism were removed would go on to X, but in entring\r\nthe surface B F of the glass it shall be turned off, as has been\r\nexplained, into the course Y W falling upon the second surface of the\r\nprism D F in W, going out of which into the air it shall be again\r\nfarther inflected. Let the light now, after it has passed the prism, be\r\nreceived upon a sheet of paper held at a proper distance, and it shall\r\npaint upon the paper the picture, image, or spectrum L M of an oblong\r\nfigure, whose length shall much exceed its breadth; though the figure\r\nshall not be oval, the ends L and M being semicircular and the sides\r\nstraight. But now this figure will be variegated with colours in this\r\nmanner. From the extremity M to some length, suppose to the line _n\r\no_, it shall be of an intense red; from _n o_ to _p q_ it shall be an\r\norange; from _p q_ to _r s_ it shall be yellow; from thence to _t u_ it\r\nshall be green; from thence to _w x_ blue; from thence to _y z_ indigo;\r\nand from thence to the end violet.\r\n\r\n11. THUS it appears that the sun’s white light by its passage through\r\nthe prism, is so changed as now to be divided into rays, which exhibit\r\nall these several colours. The question is, whether the rays while\r\nin the sun’s beam before this refraction possessed these properties\r\ndistinctly; so that some part of that beam would without the rest have\r\ngiven a red colour, and another part alone have given an..orange,\r\n&c. That this is possible to be the case, appears from hence; that if\r\na convex glass be placed between the paper and the prism, which may\r\ncollect all the rays proceeding out of the prism into its focus, as a\r\nburning glass does the sun’s direct rays; and if that focus fall upon\r\nthe paper, the spot formed by such a glass upon the paper shall appear\r\nwhite, just like the sun’s direct light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe rest remaining as before, let P Q. (in fig. 127.) be the convex\r\nglass, causing the rays to meet upon the paper H G I K in the point N,\r\nI say that point or rather spot of light shall appear white, without\r\nthe least tincture of any colour. But it is evident that into this\r\nspot are now gathered all those rays, which before when separate gave\r\nall those different colours; which shews that whiteness may be made by\r\nmixing those colours: especially if we consider, it can be proved that\r\nthe glass P Q does not alter the colour of the rays which pass through\r\nit. Which is done thus: if the paper be made to approach the glass P\r\nQ, the colours will manifest themselves as far as the magnitude of the\r\nspectrum, which the paper receives, will permit. Suppose it in the\r\nsituation _h g i k_, and that it then receive the spectrum _l m_, this\r\nspectrum shall be much smaller, than if the glass P Q were removed,\r\nand therefore the colours cannot be so much separated; but yet the\r\nextremity _m_ shall manifestly appear red, and the other extremity _l_\r\nshall be blue; and these colours as well as the intermediate ones shall\r\ndiscover themselves more perfectly, the farther the paper is removed\r\nfrom N, that is, the larger the spectrum is: the same thing happens,\r\nif the paper be removed farther off from P Q than N. Suppose into the\r\nposition θ γ η ϰ, the spectrum λ μ painted upon it shall again discover\r\nits colours, and that more distinctly, the farther the paper is\r\nremoved, but only in an inverted order: for as before, when the paper\r\nwas nearer the convex glass, than at N, the upper part of the image was\r\nblue, and the under red; now the upper part shall be red, and the under\r\nblue: because the rays cross at N.\r\n\r\n12. NAY farther that the whiteness at the focus N, is made by the union\r\nof the colours may be proved without removing the paper out of the\r\nfocus, by intercepting with any opake body part of the light near the\r\nglass; for if the under part, that is the red, or more properly the\r\nred-making rays, as they are styled by our author, are intercepted,\r\nthe spot shall take a bluish hue; and if more of the inferior rays are\r\ncut off, so that neither the red-making nor orange-making rays, and if\r\nyou please the yellow-making rays likewise, shall fall upon the spot;\r\nthen shall the spot incline more and more to the remaining colours.\r\nIn like manner if you cut off the upper part of the rays, that is the\r\nviolet coloured or indigo-making rays, the spot shall turn reddish, and\r\nbecome, more so, the more of those opposite colours are intercepted.\r\n\r\n13. THIS I think abundantly proves that whiteness may be produced by a\r\nmixture of all the colours of the spectrum. At least there is but one\r\nway of evading the present arguments, which is, by asserting that the\r\nrays of light after passing the prism have no different properties to\r\nexhibit this or the other colour, but are in that respect perfectly\r\nhomogeneal, so that the rays which pass to the under and red part of\r\nthe image do not differ in any properties whatever from those, which\r\ngo to the upper and violet part of it; but that the colours of the\r\nspectrum are produced only by some new modifications of the rays, made\r\nat their incidence upon the paper by the different terminations of\r\nlight and shadow: if indeed this assertion can be allowed any place,\r\nafter what has been said; for it seems to be sufficiently obviated\r\nby the latter part of the preceding experiment, that by intercepting\r\nthe inferior part of the light, which comes from the prism, the white\r\nspot shall receive a bluish cast, and by stopping the upper part the\r\nspot shall turn red, and in both cases recover its colour, when the\r\nintercepted light is permitted to pass again; though in all these\r\ntrials there is the like termination of light and shadow. However our\r\nauthor has contrived some experiments expresly to shew the absurdity of\r\nthis supposition; all which he has explained and enlarged upon in so\r\ndistinct and expressive a manner, that it would be wholly unnecessary\r\nto repeat them in this place[280]. I shall only mention that of them,\r\nwhich may be tried in the experiment before us. If you draw upon\r\nthe paper H G I K, and through the spot N, the straight line _w x_\r\nparallel to the horizon, and then if the paper be much inclined into\r\nthe situation _r s v t_ the line _w x_ still remaining parallel to\r\nthe horizon, the spot N shall lose its whiteness and receive a blue\r\ntincture; but if it be inclined as much the contrary way, the same\r\nspot shall exchange its white colour for a reddish dye. All which can\r\nnever be accounted for by any difference in the termination of the\r\nlight and shadow, which here is none at all; but are easily explained\r\nby supposing the upper part of the rays, whenever they enter the eye,\r\ndisposed to give the sensation of the dark colours blue, indigo and\r\nviolet; and that the under part is fitted to produce the bright colours\r\nyellow, orange and red: for when the paper is in the situation _r s t\r\nu_, it is plain that the upper part of the light falls more directly\r\nupon it, than the under part, and therefore those rays will be most\r\nplentifully reflected from it; and by their abounding in the reflected\r\nlight will cause it to incline to their colour. Just so when the paper\r\nis inclined the contrary way, it will receive the inferior rays most\r\ndirectly, and therefore ting the light it reflects with their colour.\r\n\r\n14. IT is now to be proved that these dispositions of the rays of\r\nlight to produce some one colour and some another, which manifest\r\nthemselves after their being refracted, are not wrought by any action\r\nof the prism upon them, but are originally inherent in those rays; and\r\nthat the prism only affords each species an occasion of shewing its\r\ndistinct quality by separating them one from another, which before,\r\nwhile they were blended together in the direct beam of the sun’s light,\r\nlay conceal’d. But that this is so, will be proved, if it can be shewn\r\nthat no prism has any power upon the rays, which after their passage\r\nthrough one prism are rendered uncompounded and contain in them but one\r\ncolour, either to divide that colour into several, as the sun’s light\r\nis divided, or so much as to change it into any other colour. This will\r\nbe proved by the following experiment[281]. The same thing remaining,\r\nas in the first experiment, let another prism N O (in fig. 128.) be\r\nplaced either immediately, or at some distance after the first, in a\r\nperpendicular posture, so that it shall refract the rays issuing from\r\nthe first sideways. Now if this prism could divide the light falling\r\nupon it into coloured rays, as the first has done, it would divide the\r\nspectrum breadthwise into colours, as before it was divided lengthwise;\r\nbut no such thing is observed. If L M were the spectrum, which the\r\nfirst prism D E F would paint upon the paper H G I K; P Q lying in an\r\noblique posture shall be the spectrum projected by the second, and\r\nshall be divided lengthwise into colours corresponding to the colours\r\nof the spectrum L M, and occasioned like them by the refraction of the\r\nfirst prism, but its breadth shall receive no such division; on the\r\ncontrary each colour shall be uniform from side to side, as much as in\r\nthe spectrum L M, which proves the whole assertion.\r\n\r\n15. THE same is yet much farther confirmed by another experiment.\r\nOur author teaches that the colours of the spectrum L M in the first\r\nexperiment are yet compounded, though not so much as in the sun’s\r\ndirect light. He shews therefore how, by placing the prism at a\r\ndistance from the hole, and by the use of a convex glass, to separate\r\nthe colours of the spectrum, and make them uncompounded to any degree\r\nof exactness[282]. And he shews when this is done sufficiently, if\r\nyou make a small hole in the paper whereon the spectrum is received,\r\nthrough which any one sort of rays may pass, and then let that coloured\r\nray fall so upon a prism, as to be refracted by it, it shall in no case\r\nwhatever change its colour; but shall always retain it perfectly as at\r\nfirst, however it be refracted[283].\r\n\r\n16. NOR yet will these colours after this full separation of them\r\nsuffer any change by reflection from bodies of different colours; on\r\nthe other hand they make all bodies placed in these colours appear of\r\nthe colour which falls upon them[284]: for minium in red light will\r\nappear as in open day light; but in yellow light will appear yellow;\r\nand which is more extraordinary, in green light will appear green, in\r\nblue, blue; and in the violet-purple coloured light will appear of a\r\npurple colour; in like manner verdigrease, or blue bise, will put on\r\nthe appearance of that colour, in which it is placed; so that neither\r\nbise placed in the red light shall be able to give that light the least\r\nblue tincture, or any other different from red; nor shall minium in\r\nthe indigo or violet light exhibit the least appearance of red, or any\r\nother colour distinct from that it is placed in. The only difference\r\nis, that each of these bodies appears most luminous and bright in the\r\ncolour, which corresponds with that it exhibits in the day light, and\r\ndimmed in the colours most remote from that; that is, though minium and\r\nbise placed in blue light shall both appear blue, yet the bise shall\r\nappear of a bright blue, and the minium of a dusky and obscure blue:\r\nbut if minium and bise be compared together in red light, the minium\r\nshall afford a brisk red, the bise a duller colour, though of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n17. AND this not only proves the immutability of all these simple\r\nand uncompounded colours; but likewise unfolds the whole mystery,\r\nwhy bodies appear in open day-light of such different colours, it\r\nconsisting in nothing more than this, that whereas the white light of\r\nthe day is composed of all sorts of colours, some bodies reflect the\r\nrays of one sort in greater abundance than the rays of any other[285].\r\nThough it appears by the fore-cited experiment, that almost all these\r\nbodies reflect some portion of the rays of every colour, and give the\r\nsense of particular colours only by the predominancy of some sorts of\r\nrays above the rest. And what has before been explained of composing\r\nwhite by mingling all the colours of the spectrum together shews\r\nclearly, that nothing more is required to make bodies look white,\r\nthan a power to reflect indifferently rays of every colour. But this\r\nwill more fully appear by the following method: if near the coloured\r\nspectrum in our first experiment a piece of white paper be so held, as\r\nto be illuminated equally by all the parts of that spectrum, it shall\r\nappear white; whereas if it be held nearer to the red end of the image,\r\nthan to the other, it shall turn reddish; if nearer the blue end, it\r\nshall seem bluish[286].\r\n\r\n18. OUR indefatigable and circumspect author farther examined his\r\ntheory by mixing the powders which painters use of several colours, in\r\norder if possible to produce a white powder by such a composition[287].\r\nBut in this he found some difficulties for the following reasons. Each\r\nof these coloured powders reflects but part of the light, which is\r\ncast upon them; the red powders reflecting little green or blue, and\r\nthe blue powders reflecting very little red or yellow, nor the green\r\npowders reflecting near so much of the red or indigo and purple, as\r\nof the other colours: and besides, when any of these are examined in\r\nhomogeneal light, as our author calls the colours of the prism, when\r\nwell separated, though each appears more bright and luminous in its\r\nown day-light colour, than in any other; yet white bodies, suppose\r\nwhite paper for instance, in those very colours exceed these coloured\r\nbodies themselves in brightness; so that white bodies reflect not only\r\nmore of the whole light than coloured bodies do in the day-light, but\r\neven more of that very colour which they reflect most copiously. All\r\nwhich considerations make it manifest that a mixture of these will not\r\nreflect so great a quantity of light, as a white body of the same size;\r\nand therefore will compose such a colour as would result from a mixture\r\nof white and black, such as are all grey and dun colours, rather than a\r\nstrong white. Now such a colour he compounded of certain ingredients,\r\nwhich he particularly sets down, in so much that when the composition\r\nwas strongly illuminated by the sun’s direct beams, it would appear\r\nmuch whiter than even white paper, if considerably shaded. Nay he\r\nfound by trials how to proportion the degree of illumination of the\r\nmixture and paper, so that to a spectator at a proper distance it\r\ncould not well be determined which was the more perfect colour; as he\r\nexperienced not only by himself, but by the concurrent opinion of a\r\nfriend, who chanced to visit him while he was trying this experiment.\r\nI must not here omit another method of trying the whiteness of such a\r\nmixture, proposed in one of our author’s letters on this subject[288]:\r\nwhich is to enlighten the composition by a beam of the sun let into a\r\ndarkened room, and then to receive the light reflected from it upon a\r\npiece of white paper, observing whether the paper appears white by that\r\nreflection; for if it does, it gives proof of the composition’s being\r\nwhite; because when the paper receives the reflection from any coloured\r\nbody, it looks of that colour. Agreeable to this is the trial he made\r\nupon water impregnated with soap, and agitated into a froth[289]:\r\nfor when this froth after some short time exhibited upon the little\r\nbubbles, which composed it, a great variety of colours, though these\r\ncolours to a spectator at a small distance discover’d themselves\r\ndistinctly; yet when the eye was so far removed, that each little\r\nbubble could no longer be distinguished, the whole froth by the mixture\r\nof all these colours appeared intensly white.\r\n\r\n19. OUR author having fully satisfied himself by these and many other\r\nexperiments, what the result is of mixing together all the prismatic\r\ncolours; he proceeds in the next place to examine, whether this\r\nappearance of whiteness be raised by the rays of these different kinds\r\nacting so, when they meet, upon one another, as to cause each of them\r\nto impress the sense of whiteness upon the optic nerve; or whether each\r\nray does not make upon the organ of sight the same impression, as when\r\nseparate and alone; so that the idea of whiteness is not excited by the\r\nimpression from any one part of the rays, but results from the mixture\r\nof all those different sensations. And that the latter sentiment is the\r\ntrue one, he evinces by undeniable experiments.\r\n\r\n20. IN particular the foregoing experiment[290], wherein the convex\r\nglass was used, furnishes proofs of this: in that when the paper is\r\nbrought into the situation θ γ η ϰ, beyond, beyond N the colours, that\r\nat N disappeared, begin to emerge again; which shews that by mingling\r\nat N they did not lose their colorific qualities, though for some\r\nreason they lay concealed. This farther appears by that part of the\r\nexperiment, when the paper, while in the focus, was directed to be\r\nenclined different ways; for when the paper was in such a situation,\r\nthat it must of necessity reflect the rays, which before their arrival\r\nat the point N would have given a blue colour, those rays in this\r\nvery point itself by abounding in the reflected light tinged it with\r\nthe same colour; so when the paper reflects most copiously the rays,\r\nwhich before they come to the point N exhibit redness, those same rays\r\ntincture the light reflected by the paper from that very point with\r\ntheir own proper colour.\r\n\r\n21. THERE is a certain condition relating to sight, which affords an\r\nopportunity of examining this still more fully: it is this, that the\r\nimpressions of light remain some short space upon the eye; as when a\r\nburning coal is whirl’d about in a circle, if the motion be very quick,\r\nthe eye shall not be able to distinguish the coal, but shall see an\r\nentire circle of fire. The reason of which appearance is, that the\r\nimpression made by the coal upon the eye in any one situation is not\r\nworn out, before the coal returns again to the same place, and renews\r\nthe sensation. This gives our author the hint to try, whether these\r\ncolours might not be transmitted successively to the eye so quick,\r\nthat no one of the colours should be distinctly perceived, but the\r\nmixture of the sensations should produce a uniform whiteness; when the\r\nrays could not act upon each other, because they never should meet,\r\nbut come to the eye one after another. And this thought he executed\r\nby the following expedient[291]. He made an instrument in shape like\r\na comb, which he applied near the convex glass, so that by moving it\r\nup and down slowly the teeth of it might intercept sometimes one and\r\nsometimes another colour; and accordingly the light reflected from the\r\npaper, placed at N, should change colour continually. But now when the\r\ncomb-like instrument was moved very quick, the eye lost all preception\r\nof the distinct colours, which came to it from time to time, a perfect\r\nwhiteness resulting from the mixture of all those distinct impressions\r\nin the sensorium. Now in this case there can be no suspicion of the\r\nseveral coloured rays acting upon one another, and making any change in\r\neach other’s manner of affecting the eye, seeing they do not so much as\r\nmeet together there.\r\n\r\n22. OUR author farther teaches us how to view the spectrum of colours\r\nproduced in the first experiment with another prism, so that it shall\r\nappear to the eye under the shape of a round spot and perfectly\r\nwhite[292]. And in this case if the comb be used to intercept\r\nalternately some of the colours, which compose the spectrum, the round\r\nspot shall change its colour according to the colours intercepted; but\r\nif the comb be moved too swiftly for those changes to be distinctly\r\nperceived, the spot shall seem always white, as before[293].\r\n\r\n23. BESIDES this whiteness, which results from an universal composition\r\nof all sorts of colours, our author particularly explains the effects\r\nof other less compounded mixtures; some of which compound other colours\r\nlike some of the simple ones, but others produce colours different\r\nfrom any of them. For instance, a mixture of red and yellow compound\r\na colour like in appearance to the orange, which in the spectrum lies\r\nbetween them; as a composition of yellow and blue is made use of in all\r\ndyes to make a green. But red and violet purple compounded make purples\r\nunlike to any of the prismatic colours, and these joined with yellow\r\nor blue make yet new colours. Besides one rule is here to be observed,\r\nthat when many different colours are mixed, the colour which arises\r\nfrom the mixture grows languid and degenerates into whiteness. So when\r\nyellow green and blue are mixed together, the compound will be green;\r\nbut if to this you add red and purple, the colour shall first grow dull\r\nand less vivid, and at length by adding more of these colours it shall\r\nturn to whiteness, or some other colour[294].\r\n\r\n24. ONLY here is one thing remarkable of those compounded colours,\r\nwhich are like in appearance to the simple ones; that the simple\r\nones when viewed through a prism shall still retain their colour,\r\nbut the compounded colours seen through such a glass shall be parted\r\ninto the simple ones of which they are the aggregate. And for this\r\nreason any body illuminated by the simple light shall appear through\r\na prism distinctly, and have its minutest parts observable, as may\r\neasily be tried with flies, or other such little bodies, which have\r\nvery small parts; but the same viewed in this manner when enlighten’d\r\nwith compounded colours shall appear confused, their smallest parts\r\nnot being distinguishable. How the prism separates these compounded\r\ncolours, as likewise how it divides the light of the sun into its\r\ncolours, has not yet been explained; but is reserved for our third\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n25. IN the mean time what has been said, I hope, will suffice to\r\ngive a taste of our author’s way of arguing, and in some measure to\r\nillustrate the proposition laid down in this chapter.\r\n\r\n26. THERE are methods of separating the heterogeneous rays of the\r\nsun’s light by reflection, which perfectly conspire with and confirm\r\nthis reasoning. One of which ways may be this. Let A B (in fig. 129)\r\nrepresent the window shutter of a darkened room; C a hole to let in\r\nthe sun’s rays; D E F, G H I two prisms so applied together, that the\r\nsides E F and G I be contiguous, and the sides D F, G H parallel; by\r\nthis means the light will pass through them without any separation\r\ninto colours: but if it be afterwards received by a third prism I K L,\r\nit shall be divided so as to form upon any white body P Q the usual\r\ncolours, violet at _m_, blue at _n_, green at _o_, yellow at _r_, and\r\nred at _s_. But because it never happens that the two adjacent surfaces\r\nE F and G I perfectly touch, part only of the light incident upon the\r\nsurface E F shall be transmitted, and part shall be reflected. Let now\r\nthe reflected part be received by a fourth prism Δ Θ Λ, and passing\r\nthrough it paint upon a white body Ζ Γ the colours of the prism, red\r\nat _t_, yellow at _u_, green at _w_, blue at _x_, violet at _y_. If\r\nthe prisms D E F, G H I be slowly turned about while they remain\r\ncontiguous, the colours upon the body P Q shall not sensibly change\r\ntheir situation, till such time as the rays become pretty oblique to\r\nthe surface E F; but then the light incident upon the surface E F shall\r\nbegin to be wholly reflected. And first of all the violet light shall\r\nbe wholly reflected, and thereupon will disappear at _m_, appearing\r\ninstead thereof at _y_, and increasing the violet light falling there,\r\nthe other colours remaining as before. If the prisms D E F, G H I be\r\nturned a little farther about, that the incident rays become yet more\r\ninclined to the surface E F, the blue shall be totally reflected, and\r\nshall disappear in _n_, but appear at _x_ by making the colour there\r\nmore intense. And the same may be continued, till all the colours are\r\nsuccessively removed from the surface P Q to Ζ Γ. But in any case,\r\nsuppose when the violet and the blue have forsaken the surface P Q,\r\nand appear upon the surface Ζ Γ, Ζ Γ, the green, yellow, and red only\r\nremaining upon the surface P Q; if the light be received upon a paper\r\nheld any where in its whole passage between the light’s coming out of\r\nthe prisms D E F, G I H and its incidence upon the prism I K L, it\r\nshall appear of the colour compounded of all the colours seen upon P\r\nQ; and the reflected ray, received upon a piece of white paper held\r\nany where between the prisms D E F and Δ Θ Σ shall exhibit the colour\r\ncompounded of those the surface P Q is deprived of mixed with the sun’s\r\nlight: whereas before any of the light was reflected from the surface\r\nE F, the rays between the prisms G H I and I K L would appear white;\r\nas will likewise the reflected ray both before and after the total\r\nreflection, provided the difference of refraction by the surfaces D F\r\nand D E be inconsiderable. I call here the sun’s light white, as I have\r\nall along done; but it is more exact to ascribe to it something of a\r\nyellowish tincture, occasioned by the brighter colours abounding in it;\r\nwhich caution is necessary in examining the colours of the reflected\r\nbeam, when all the violet and blue are in it: for this yellowish turn\r\nof the sun’s light causes the blue not to be quite so visible in it,\r\nas it should be, were the light perfectly white; but makes the beam of\r\nlight incline rather towards a pale white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP~. II.\r\n\r\nOf the properties of BODIES, upon which their COLOURS depend.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER having shewn in the last chapter, that the difference between\r\nthe colours of bodies viewed in open day-light is only this, that some\r\nbodies are disposed to reflect rays of one colour in the greatest\r\nplenty, and other bodies rays of some other colour; order now requires\r\nus to examine more particularly into the property of bodies, which\r\ngives them this difference. But this our author shews to be nothing\r\nmore, than the different magnitude of the particles, which compose each\r\nbody: this I question not will appear no small paradox. And indeed\r\nthis whole chapter will contain scarce any assertions, but what will\r\nbe almost incredible, though the arguments for them are so strong and\r\nconvincing, that they force our assent. In the former chapter have\r\nbeen explained properties of light, not in the least thought of before\r\nour author’s discovery of them; yet are they not difficult to admit,\r\nas soon as experiments are known to give proof of their reality; but\r\nsome of the propositions to be stated here will, I fear, be accounted\r\nalmost past belief; notwithstanding that the arguments, by which they\r\nare established are unanswerable. For it is proved by our author, that\r\nbodies are rendered transparent by the minuteness of their pores, and\r\nbecome opake by having them large; and more, that the most transparent\r\nbody by being reduced to a great thinness will become less pervious to\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n2. BUT whereas it had been the received opinion, and yet remains so\r\namong all who have not studied this philosophy, that light is reflected\r\nfrom bodies by its impinging against their solid parts, rebounding from\r\nthem, as a tennis ball or other elastic substance would do, when struck\r\nagainst any hard and resisting surface; it will be proper to begin with\r\ndeclaring our author’s sentiment concerning this, who shews by many\r\narguments that reflection cannot be caused by any such means[295]: some\r\nfew of his proofs I shall set down, referring the reader to our author\r\nhimself for the rest.\r\n\r\n3. IT is well known, that when light falls upon any transparent body,\r\nglass for instance, part of it is reflected and part transmitted;\r\nfor which it is ready to account, by saying that part of the light\r\nenters the pores of the glass, and part impinges upon its solid\r\nparts. But when the transmitted light arrives at the farther surface\r\nof the glass, in passing out of glass into air there is as strong a\r\nreflection caused, or rather something stronger. Now it is not to\r\nbe conceived, how the light should find as many solid parts in the\r\nair to strike against as in the glass, or even a greater number of\r\nthem. And to augment the difficulty, if water be placed behind the\r\nglass, the reflection becomes much weaker. Can we therefore say, that\r\nwater has fewer solid parts for the light to strike against, than the\r\nair? And if we should, what reason can be given for the reflection’s\r\nbeing stronger, when the air by the air-pump is removed from behind\r\nthe glass, than when the air receives the rays of light. Besides the\r\nlight may be so inclined to the hinder surface of the glass, that it\r\nshall wholly be reflected, which happens when the angle which the\r\nray makes with the surface does not exceed about 49⅓ degrees; but if\r\nthe inclination be a very little increased, great part of the light\r\nwill be transmitted; and how the light in one case should meet with\r\nnothing but the solid parts of the air, and by so small a change of\r\nits inclination find pores in great plenty, is wholly inconceivable.\r\nIt cannot be said, that the light is reflected by striking against\r\nthe solid parts of the surface of the glass; because without making\r\nany change in that surface, only by placing water contiguous to it\r\ninstead of air, great part of that light shall be transmitted, which\r\ncould find no passage through the air. Moreover in the last experiment\r\nrecited in the preceding chapter, when by turning the prisms D E F, G\r\nH I, the blue light became wholly reflected, while the rest was mostly\r\ntransmitted, no possible reason can be assigned, why the blue-making\r\nrays should meet with nothing but the solid parts of the air between\r\nthe prisms, and the rest of the light in the very same obliquity find\r\npores in abundance. Nay farther, when two glasses touch each other, no\r\nreflection at all is made; though it does not in the least appear,\r\nhow the rays should avoid the solid parts of glass, when contiguous\r\nto other glass, any more than when contiguous to air. But in the last\r\nplace upon this supposition it is not to be comprehended, how the most\r\npolished substances could reflect the light in that regular manner we\r\nfind they do; for when a polished looking glass is covered over with\r\nquicksilver, we cannot suppose the particles of light so much larger\r\nthan those of the quicksilver that they should not be scattered as\r\nmuch in reflection, as a parcel of marbles thrown down upon a rugged\r\npavement. The only cause of so uniform and regular a reflection must be\r\nsome more secret cause, uniformly spread over the whole surface of the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n4. BUT now, since the reflection of light from bodies does not depend\r\nupon its impinging against their solid parts, some other reason must\r\nbe sought for. And first it is past doubt that the least parts of\r\nalmost all bodies are transparent, even the microscope shewing as\r\nmuch[296]; besides that it may be experienced by this method. Take any\r\nthin plate of the opakest body, and apply it to a small hole designed\r\nfor the admission of light into a darkened room; however opake that\r\nbody may seem in open day-light, it shall under these circumstances\r\nsufficiently discover its transparency, provided only the body be very\r\nthin. White metals indeed do not easily shew themselves transparent in\r\nthese trials, they reflecting almost all the light incident upon them\r\nat their first superficies; the cause of which will appear in what\r\nfollows[297]. But yet these substances, when reduced into parts of\r\nextraordinary minuteness by being dissolved in aqua fortis or the like\r\ncorroding liquors do also become transparent.\r\n\r\n5. SINCE therefore the light finds free passage through the least\r\nparts of bodies, let us consider the largeness of their pores, and\r\nwe shall find, that whenever a ray of light has passed through any\r\nparticle of a body, and is come to its farther surface, if it finds\r\nthere another particle contiguous, it will without interruption pass\r\ninto that particle; just as light will pass through one piece of glass\r\ninto another piece in contact with it without any impediment, or any\r\npart being reflected: but as the light in passing out of glass, or any\r\nother transparent body, shall part of it be reflected back, if it enter\r\ninto air or other transparent body of a different density from that\r\nit passes out of; the same thing will happen in the light’s passage\r\nthrough any particle of a body, whenever at its exit out of that\r\nparticle it meets no other particle contiguous, but must enter into a\r\npore, for in this case it shall not all pass through, but part of it\r\nbe reflected back. Thus will the light, every time it enters a pore,\r\nbe in part reflected; so that nothing more seems necessary to opacity,\r\nthan that the particles, which compose any body, touch but in very\r\nfew places, and that the pores of it are numerous and large, so that\r\nthe light may in part be reflected from it, and the other part, which\r\nenters too deep to be returned out of the body, by numerous reflections\r\nmay be stifled and lost[298]; which in all probability happens, as\r\noften as it impinges against the solid part of the body, all the light\r\nwhich does so not being reflected back, but stopt, and deprived of any\r\nfarther motion[299].\r\n\r\n6. THIS notion of opacity is greatly confirmed by the observation,\r\nthat opake bodies become transparent by filling up the pores with any\r\nsubstance of near the same density with their parts. As when paper\r\nis wet with water or oyl; when linnen cloth is either dipt in water,\r\noyled, or varnished; or the oculus mundi stone steeped in water[300].\r\nAll which experiments confirm both the first assertion, that light is\r\nnot reflected by striking upon the solid parts of bodies; and also\r\nthe second, that its passage is obstructed by the reflections it\r\nundergoes in the pores; since we find it in these trials to pass in\r\ngreater abundance through bodies, when the number of their solid parts\r\nis increased, only by taking away in great measure those reflections;\r\nwhich filling the pores with a substance of near the same density\r\nwith the parts of the body will do. Besides as filling the pores of a\r\ndark body makes it transparent; so on the other hand evacuating the\r\npores of a body transparent, or separating the parts of such a body,\r\nrenders it opake. As salts or wet paper by being dried, glass by being\r\nreduced to powder or the surface made rough; and it is well known that\r\nglass vessels discover cracks in them by their opacity. Just so water\r\nitself becomes impervious to the light by being formed into many small\r\nbubbles, whether in froth, or by being mixed and agitated with any\r\nquantity of a liquor with which it will not incorporate, such as oyl\r\nof turpentine, or oyl olive.\r\n\r\n7. A CERTAIN electrical experiment made by Mr. HAUKSBEE may not perhaps\r\nbe useless to clear up the present speculation, by shewing that\r\nsomething more is necessary besides mere porosity for transmitting\r\nfreely other fine substances. The experiment is this; that a glass cane\r\nrubbed till it put forth its electric quality would agitate leaf brass\r\ninclosed under a glass vessel, though not at so great a distance, as if\r\nno body had intervened; yet the same cane would lose all its influence\r\non the leaf brass by the interposition of a piece of the finest muslin,\r\nwhose pores are immensely larger and more patent than those of glass.\r\n\r\n8. THUS I have endeavoured to smooth my way, as much as I could, to\r\nthe unfolding yet greater secrets in nature; for I shall now proceed\r\nto shew the reason why bodies appear of different colours. My reader\r\nno doubt will be sufficiently surprized, when I inform him that the\r\nknowledge of this is deduced from that ludicrous experiment, with which\r\nchildren divert themselves in blowing bubbles of water made tenacious\r\nby the solution of soap. And that these bubbles, as they gradually grow\r\nthinner and thinner till they break, change successively their colours\r\nfrom the same principle, as all natural bodies preserve theirs.\r\n\r\n9. OUR author after preparing water with soap, so as to render it very\r\ntenacious, blew it up into a bubble, and placing it under a glass,\r\nthat it might not be irregularly agitated by the air, observed as\r\nthe water by subsiding changed the thickness of the bubble, making\r\nit gradually less and less till the bubble broke; there successively\r\nappeared colours at the top of the bubble, which spread themselves\r\ninto rings surrounding the top and descending more and more, till they\r\nvanished at the bottom in the same order in which they appeared[301].\r\nThe colours emerged in this order: first red, then blue; to which\r\nsucceeded red a second time, and blue immediately followed; after that\r\nred a third time, succeeded by blue; to which followed a fourth red,\r\nbut succeeded by green; after this a more numerous order of colours,\r\nfirst red, then yellow, next green, and after that blue, and at last\r\npurple; then again red, yellow, green, blue, violet followed each other\r\nin order; and in the last place red, yellow, white, blue; to which\r\nsucceeded a dark spot, which reflected scarce any light, though our\r\nauthor found it did make some very obscure reflection, for the image of\r\nthe sun or a candle might be faintly discerned upon it; and this last\r\nspot spread itself more and more, till the bubble at last broke. These\r\ncolours were not simple and uncompounded colours, like those which\r\nare exhibited by the prism, when due care is taken to separate them;\r\nbut were made by a various mixture of those simple colours, as will\r\nbe shewn in the next chapter: whence these colours, to which I have\r\ngiven the name of blue, green, or red, were not all alike, but differed\r\nas follows. The blue, which appeared next the dark spot, was a pure\r\ncolour, but very faint, resembling the sky-colour; the white next to\r\nit a very strong and intense white, brighter much than the white, which\r\nthe bubble reflected, before any of the colours appeared. The yellow\r\nwhich preceded this was at first pretty good, but soon grew dilute;\r\nand the red which went before the yellow at first gave a tincture of\r\nscarlet inclining to violet, but soon changed into a brighter colour;\r\nthe violet of the next series was deep with little or no redness in\r\nit; the blue a brisk colour, but came much short of the blue in the\r\nnext order; the green was but dilute and pale; the yellow and red were\r\nvery bright and full, the best of all the yellows which appeared among\r\nany of the colours: in the preceding orders the purple was reddish,\r\nbut the blue, as was just now said, the brightest of all; the green\r\npretty lively better than in the order which appeared before it, though\r\nthat was a good willow green; the yellow but small in quantity, though\r\nbright; the red of this order not very pure: those which appeared\r\nbefore yet more obscure, being very dilute and dirty; as were likewise\r\nthe three first blues.\r\n\r\n10. NOW it is evident, that these colours arose at the top of the\r\nbubble, as it grew by degrees thinner and thinner: but what the express\r\nthickness of the bubble was, where each of these colours appeared upon\r\nit, could not be determined by these experiments; but was found by\r\nanother means, viz. by taking the object glass of a long telescope,\r\nwhich is in a small degree convex, and placing it upon a flat glass,\r\nso as to touch it in one point, and then water being put between them,\r\nthe same colours appeared as in the bubble, in the form of circles or\r\nrings surrounding the point where the glasses touched, which appeared\r\nblack for want of any reflection from it, like the top of the bubble\r\nwhen thinnest[302]: next to this spot lay a blue circle, and next\r\nwithout that a white one; and so on in the same order as before,\r\nreckoning from the dark spot. And henceforward I shall speak of each\r\ncolour, as being of the first, second, or any following order, as it is\r\nthe first, second, or any following one, counting from the black spot\r\nin the center of these rings; which is contrary to the order in which\r\nI must have mentioned them, if I should have reputed them the first,\r\nsecond, or third, &c. in order, as they arise after one another upon\r\nthe top of the bubble.\r\n\r\n11. But now by measuring the diameters of each of these rings, and\r\nknowing the convexity of the telescope glass, the thickness of the\r\nwater at each of those rings may be determined with great exactness:\r\nfor instance the thickness of it, where the white light of the first\r\norder is reflected, is about 3⅞ such parts, of which an inch contains\r\n1000000[303]. And this measure gives the thickness of the bubble, where\r\nit appeared of this white colour, as well as of the water between the\r\nglasses; though the transparent body which surrounds the water in these\r\ntwo cases be very different: for our author found, that the condition\r\nof the ambient body would not alter the species of the colour at all,\r\nthough it might its strength and brightness; for pieces of Muscovy\r\nglass, which were so thin as to appear coloured by being wet with\r\nwater, would have their colours faded and made less bright thereby; but\r\nhe could not observe their species at all to be changed. So that the\r\nthickness of any transparent body determines its colour, whatever body\r\nthe light passes through in coming to it[304].\r\n\r\n12. BUT it was found that different transparent bodies would not under\r\nthe same thicknesses exhibit the same colours: for if the forementioned\r\nglasses were laid upon each other without any water between their\r\nsurfaces, the air itself would afford the same colours as the water,\r\nbut more expanded, insomuch that each ring had a larger diameter, and\r\nall in the same proportion. So that the thickness of the air proper to\r\neach colour was in the same proportion larger, than the thickness of\r\nthe water appropriated to the same[305].\r\n\r\n13. IF we examine with care all the circumstances of these colours,\r\nwhich will be enumerated in the next chapter, we shall not be\r\nsurprized, that our author takes them to bear a great analogy to the\r\ncolours of natural bodies[306]. For the regularity of those various and\r\nstrange appearances relating to them, which makes the most mysterious\r\npart of the action between light and bodies, as the next chapter will\r\nshew, is sufficient to convince us that the principle, from which\r\nthey flow, is of the greatest importance in the frame of nature; and\r\ntherefore without question is designed for no less a purpose than to\r\ngive bodies their various colours, to which end it seems very fitly\r\nsuited. For if any such transparent substance of the thickness\r\nproper to produce any one colour should be cut into slender threads,\r\nor broken into fragments, it does not appear but these should retain\r\nthe same colour; and a heap of such fragments should frame a body of\r\nthat colour. So that this is without dispute the cause why bodies are\r\nof this or the other colour, that the particles of which they are\r\ncomposed are of different sizes. Which is farther confirmed by the\r\nanalogy between the colours of thin plates, and the colours of many\r\nbodies. For example, these plates do not look of the same colour when\r\nviewed obliquely, as when seen direct; for if the rings and colours\r\nbetween a convex and plane glass are viewed first in a direct manner,\r\nand then at different degrees of obliquity, the rings will be observed\r\nto dilate themselves more and more as the obliquity is increased[307];\r\nwhich shews that the transparent substance between the glasses does\r\nnot exhibit the same colour at the same thickness in all situations of\r\nthe eye: just so the colours in the very same part of a peacock’s tail\r\nchange, as the tail changes posture in respect of the sight. Also the\r\ncolours of silks, cloths, and other substances, which water or oyl can\r\nintimately penetrate, become faint and dull by the bodies being wet\r\nwith such fluids, and recover their brightness again when dry; just\r\nas it was before said that plates of Muscovy glass grew faint and dim\r\nby wetting. To this may be added, that the colours which painters use\r\nwill be a little changed by being ground very elaborately, without\r\nquestion by the diminution of their parts. All which particulars, and\r\nmany more that might be extracted from our author, give abundant\r\nproof of the present point. I shall only subjoin one more: these\r\ntransparent plates transmit through them all the light they do not\r\nreflect; so that when looked through they exhibit those colours, which\r\nresult from the depriving white light of the colour reflected. This\r\nmay commodiously be tryed by the glasses so often mentioned; which if\r\nlooked through exhibit coloured rings as by reflected light, but in a\r\ncontrary order; for the middle spot, which in the other view appears\r\nblack for want of reflected light, now looks perfectly white, opposite\r\nto the blue circle; next without this spot the light appears tinged\r\nwith a yellowish red; where the white circle appeared before, it now\r\nseems dark; and so of the rest[308]. Now in the same manner, the light\r\ntransmitted through foliated gold into a darkened room appears greenish\r\nby the loss of the yellow light, which gold reflects.\r\n\r\n14. HENCE it follows, that the colours of bodies give a very probable\r\nground for making conjecture concerning the magnitude of their\r\nconstituent particles[309]. My reason for calling it a conjecture is,\r\nits being difficult to fix certainly the order of any colour. The\r\ngreen of vegetables our author judges to be of the third order, partly\r\nbecause of the intenseness of their colour; and partly from the changes\r\nthey suffer when they wither, turning at first into a greenish or more\r\nperfect yellow, and afterwards some of them to an orange or red; which\r\nchanges seem to be effected from their ringing particles growing denser\r\nby the exhalation of their moisture, and perhaps augmented likewise\r\nby the accretion of the earthy and oily parts of that moisture. How\r\nthe mentioned colours should arise from increasing the bulk of those\r\nparticles, is evident; seeing those colours lie without the ring\r\nof green between the glasses, and are therefore formed where the\r\ntransparent substance which reflects them is thicker. And that the\r\naugmentation of the density of the colorific particles will conspire\r\nto the production of the same effect, will be evident; if we remember\r\nwhat was said of the different size of the rings, when air was included\r\nbetween the glasses, from their size when water was between them; which\r\nshewed that a substance of a greater density than another gives the\r\nsame colour at a less thickness. Now the changes likely to be wrought\r\nin the density or magnitude of the parts of vegetables by withering\r\nseem not greater, than are sufficient to change their colour into those\r\nof the same order; but the yellow and red of the fourth order are not\r\nfull enough to agree with those, into which these substances change,\r\nnor is the green of the second sufficiently good to be the colour of\r\nvegetables; so that their colour must of necessity be of the third\r\norder.\r\n\r\n15. THE blue colour of syrup of violets our author supposes to be of\r\nthe third order; for acids, as vinegar, with this syrup change it red,\r\nand salt of tartar or other alcalies mixed therewith turn it green.\r\nBut if the blue colour of the syrup were of the second order, the red\r\ncolour, which acids by attenuating its parts give it, must be of the\r\nfirst order, and the green given it by alcalies by incrassating its\r\nparticles should be of the second; whereas neither of those colours is\r\nperfect enough, especially the green, to answer those produced by these\r\nchanges; but the red may well enough be allowed to be of the second\r\norder, and the green of the third; in which case the blue must be\r\nlikewise of the third order.\r\n\r\n16. THE azure colour of the skies our author takes to be of the\r\nfirst order, which requires the smallest particles of any colour,\r\nand therefore most like to be exhibited by vapours, before they have\r\nsufficiently coalesced to produce clouds of other colours.\r\n\r\n17. THE most intense and luminous white is of the first order, if\r\nless strong it is a mixture of the colours of all the orders. Of\r\nthe latter sort he takes the colour of linnen, paper, and such like\r\nsubstances to be; but white metals to be of the former sort. The\r\narguments for it are these. The opacity of all bodies has been shewn\r\nto arise from the number and strength of the reflections made within\r\nthem; but all experiments shew, that the strongest reflection is made\r\nat those surfaces, which intercede transparent bodies differing most\r\nin density. Among other instances of this, the experiments before us\r\nafford one; for when air only is included between the glasses, the\r\ncoloured rings are not only more dilated, as has before been said,\r\nthan when water is between them; but are likewise much more luminous\r\nand bright. It follows therefore, that whatever medium pervades the\r\npores of bodies, if so be there is any, those substances must be most\r\nopake, the density of whose parts differs most from the density of the\r\nmedium, which fills their pores. But it has been sufficiently proved\r\nin the former part of this tract, that there is no very dense medium\r\nlodging in, at least pervading at liberty the pores of bodies. And it\r\nis farther proved by the present experiments. For when air is inclosed\r\nby the denser substance of glass, the rings dilate themselves, as\r\nhas been said, by being viewed obliquely; this they do so very much,\r\nthat at different obliquities the same thickness of air will exhibit\r\nall sorts of colours. The bubble of water, though surrounded with the\r\nthinner substance of air, does likewise change its colour by being\r\nviewed obliquely; but not any thing near so much, as in the other case;\r\nfor in that the same colour might be seen, when the rings were viewed\r\nmost obliquely, at more than twelve times the thickness it appeared\r\nat under a direct view; whereas in this other case the thickness was\r\nnever found considerably above half as much again. Now the colours of\r\nbodies not depending only on the light, that is incident upon them\r\nperpendicularly, but likewise upon that, which falls on them in all\r\ndegrees of obliquity; if the medium surrounding their particles were\r\ndenser than those particles, all sorts of colours must of necessity\r\nbe reflected from them so copiously, as would make the colours of all\r\nbodies white, or grey, or at best very dilute and imperfect. But on\r\nthe other hand, if the medium in the pores of bodies be much rarer\r\nthan their particles, the colour reflected will be so little changed\r\nby the obliquity of the rays, that the colour produced by the rays,\r\nwhich fall near the perpendicular, may so much abound in the reflected\r\nlight, as to give the body their colour with little allay. To this\r\nmay be added, that when the difference of the contiguous transparent\r\nsubstances is the same, a colour reflected from the denser substance\r\nreduced into a thin plate and surrounded by the rarer will be more\r\nbrisk, than the same colour will be, when reflected from a thin plate\r\nformed of the rarer substance, and surrounded by the denser; as our\r\nauthor experienced by blowing glass very thin at a lamp furnace,\r\nwhich exhibited in the open air more vivid colours, than the air does\r\nbetween two glasses. From these considerations it is manifest, that\r\nif all other circumstances are alike, the densest bodies will be most\r\nopake. But it was observed before, that these white metals can hardly\r\nbe made so thin, except by being dissolved in corroding liquors, as\r\nto be rendred transparent; though none of them are so dense as gold,\r\nwhich proves their great opacity to have some other cause besides their\r\ndensity; and none is more fit to produce this, than such a size of\r\ntheir particles, as qualifies them to reflect the white of the first\r\norder.\r\n\r\n18. FOR producing black the particles ought to be smaller than for\r\nexhibiting any of the colours, viz. of a size answering to the\r\nthickness of the bubble, where by reflecting little or no light it\r\nappears colourless; but yet they must not be too small, for that will\r\nmake them transparent through deficiency of reflections in the inward\r\nparts of the body, sufficient to stop the light from going through it;\r\nbut they must be of a size bordering upon that disposed to reflect\r\nthe faint blue of the first order, which affords an evident reason why\r\nblacks usually partake a little of that colour. We see too, why bodies\r\ndissolved by fire or putrefaction turn black: and why in grinding\r\nglasses upon copper plates the dust of the glass, copper, and sand it\r\nis ground with, become very black: and in the last place why these\r\nblack substances communicate so easily to others their hue; which is,\r\nthat their particles by reason of the great minuteness of them easily\r\noverspread the grosser particles of others.\r\n\r\n19. I SHALL now finish this chapter with one remark of the exceeding\r\ngreat porosity in bodies necessarily required in all that has here\r\nbeen said; which, when duly considered, must appear very surprizing;\r\nbut perhaps it will be matter of greater surprize, when I affirm that\r\nthe sagacity of our author has discovered a method, by which bodies\r\nmay easily become so; nay how any the least portion of matter may be\r\nwrought into a body of any assigned dimensions how great so ever, and\r\nyet the pores of that body none of them greater, than any the smallest\r\nmagnitude proposed at pleasure; notwithstanding which the parts of the\r\nbody shall so touch, that the body itself shall be hard and solid[310].\r\nThe manner is this: suppose the body be compounded of particles of\r\nsuch figures, that when laid together the pores found between them\r\nmay be equal in bigness to the particles; how this may be effected,\r\nand yet the body be hard and solid, is not difficult to understand;\r\nand the pores of such a body may be made of any proposed degree of\r\nsmallness. But the solid matter of a body so framed will take up only\r\nhalf the space occupied by the body; and if each constituent particle\r\nbe composed of other less particles according to the same rule, the\r\nsolid parts of such a body will be but a fourth part of its bulk; if\r\nevery one of these lesser particles again be compounded in the same\r\nmanner, the solid parts of the whole body shall be but one eighth of\r\nits bulk; and thus by continuing the composition the solid parts of the\r\nbody may be made to bear as small a proportion to the whole magnitude\r\nof the body, as shall be desired, notwithstanding the body will be by\r\nthe contiguity of its parts capable of being in any degree hard. Which\r\nshews that this whole globe of earth, nay all the known bodies in the\r\nuniverse together, as far as we know, may be compounded of no greater\r\na portion of solid matter, than might be reduced into a globe of one\r\ninch only in diameter, or even less. We see therefore how by this means\r\nbodies may easily be made rare enough to transmit light, with all\r\nthat freedom pellucid bodies are found to do. Though what is the real\r\nstructure of bodies we yet know not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP. III.~\r\n\r\nOf the REFRACTION, REFLECTION, and INFLECTION of LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS much of the colours of natural bodies; our method now leads us\r\nto speculations yet greater, no less than to lay open the causes of\r\nall that has hitherto been related. For it must in this chapter be\r\nexplained, how the prism separates the colours of the sun’s light, as\r\nwe found in the first chapter; and why the thin transparent plates\r\ndiscoursed of in the last chapter, and consequently the particles of\r\ncoloured bodies, reflect that diversity of colours only by being of\r\ndifferent thicknesses.\r\n\r\n2. FOR the first it is proved by our author, that the colours of the\r\nsun’s light are manifested by the prism, from the rays undergoing\r\ndifferent degrees of refraction; that the violet-making rays, which\r\ngo to the upper part of the coloured image in the first experiment\r\nof the first chapter, are the most refracted; that the indigo-making\r\nrays are refracted, or turned out of their course by passing through\r\nthe prism, something less than the violet-making rays, but more than\r\nthe blue-making rays; and the blue-making rays more than the green;\r\nthe green-making rays more than the yellow; the yellow more than the\r\norange; and the orange-making rays more than the red-making, which are\r\nleast of all refracted. The first proof of this, that rays of different\r\ncolours are refracted unequally is this. If you take any body, and\r\npaint one half of it red and the other half blue, then upon viewing\r\nit through a prism those two parts shall appear separated from each\r\nother; which can be caused no otherwise than by the prism’s refracting\r\nthe light of one half more than the light of the other half. But the\r\nblue half will be most refracted; for if the body be seen through the\r\nprism in such a situation, that the body shall appear lifted upwards\r\nby the refraction, as a body within a bason of water, in the experiment\r\nmentioned in the first chapter, appeared to be lifted up by the\r\nrefraction of the water, so as to be seen at a greater distance than\r\nwhen the bason is empty, then shall the blue part appear higher than\r\nthe red; but if the refraction of the prism be the contrary way, the\r\nblue part shall be depressed more than the other. Again, after laying\r\nfine threads of black silk across each of the colours, and the body\r\nwell inlightened, if the rays coming from it be received upon a convex\r\nglass, so that it may by refracting the rays cast the image of the body\r\nupon a piece of white paper held beyond the glass; then it will be seen\r\nthat the black threads upon the red part of the image, and those upon\r\nthe blue part, do not at the same time appear distinctly in the image\r\nof the body projected by the glass; but if the paper be held so, that\r\nthe threads on the blue part may distinctly appear, the threads cannot\r\nbe seen distinct upon the red part; but the paper must be drawn farther\r\noff from the convex glass to make the threads on this part visible; and\r\nwhen the distance is great enough for the threads to be seen in this\r\nred part, they become indistinct in the other. Whence it appears that\r\nthe rays proceeding from each point of the blue part of the body are\r\nsooner united again by the convex glass than the rays which come from\r\neach point of the red parts[311]. But both these experiments prove that\r\nthe blue-making rays, as well in the small refraction of the convex\r\nglass, as in the greater refraction of the prism, are more bent, than\r\nthe red-making rays.\r\n\r\n3. THIS seems already to explain the reason of the coloured spectrum\r\nmade by refracting the sun’s light with a prism, though our author\r\nproceeds to examine that in particular, and proves that the different\r\ncoloured rays in that spectrum are in different degrees refracted; by\r\nshewing how to place the prism in such a posture, that if all the rays\r\nwere refracted in the same manner, the spectrum should of necessity\r\nbe round: whereas in that case if the angle made by the two surfaces\r\nof the prism, through which the light passes, that is the angle D F\r\nE in fig. 126, be about 63 or 64 degrees, the image instead of being\r\nround shall be near five times as long as broad; a difference enough\r\nto shew a great inequality in the refractions of the rays, which\r\ngo to the opposite extremities of the image. To leave no scruple\r\nunremoved, our author is very particular in shewing by a great number\r\nof experiments, that this inequality of refraction is not casual, and\r\nthat it does not depend upon any irregularities of the glass; no nor\r\nthat the rays are in their passage through the prism each split and\r\ndivided; but on the contrary that every ray of the sun has its own\r\npeculiar degree of refraction proper to it, according to which it is\r\nmore or less refracted in passing through pellucid substances always\r\nin the same manner[312]. That the rays are not split and multiplied\r\nby the refraction of the prism, the third of the experiments related\r\nin our first chapter shews very clearly; for if they were, and the\r\nlength of the spectrum in the first refraction were thereby occasioned,\r\nthe breadth should be no less dilated by the cross refraction of the\r\nsecond prism; whereas the breadth is not at all increased, but the\r\nimage is only thrown into an oblique posture by the upper part of the\r\nrays which were at first more refracted than the under part, being\r\nagain turned farthest out of their course. But the experiment most\r\nexpressly adapted to prove this regular diversity of refraction is\r\nthis, which follows[313]. Two boards A B, C D (in fig. 130.) being\r\nerected in a darkened room at a proper distance, one of them A B being\r\nnear the window-shutter E F, a space only being left for the prism G\r\nH I to be placed between them; so that the rays entring at the hole M\r\nof the window-shutter may after passing through the prism be trajected\r\nthrough a smaller hole K made in the board A B, and passing on from\r\nthence go out at another hole L made in the board C D of the same size\r\nas the hole K, and small enough to transmit the rays of one colour\r\nonly at a time; let another prism N O P be placed after the board C\r\nD to receive the rays passing through the holes K and L, and after\r\nrefraction by that prism let those rays fall upon the white surface\r\nQ R. Suppose first the violet light to pass through the holes, and\r\nto be refracted by the prism N O P to _s_, which if the prism N O P\r\nwere removed should have passed right onto W. If the prism G H I be\r\nturned slowly about, while the boards and prism N O P remain fixed,\r\nin a little time another colour will fall upon the hole L, which, if\r\nthe prism N O P were taken away, would proceed like the former rays\r\nto the same point W; but the refraction of the prism N O P shall not\r\ncarry these rays to _s_, but to some place less distant from W as to\r\n_t_. Suppose now the rays which go to _t_ to be the indigo-making rays.\r\nIt is manifest that the boards A B, C D, and prism N O P remaining\r\nimmoveable, both the violet-making and indigo-making rays are incident\r\nalike upon the prism N O P, for they are equally inclined to its\r\nsurface O P, and enter it in the same part of that surface; which shews\r\nthat the indigo-making rays are less diverted out of their course by\r\nthe refraction of the prism, than the violet-making rays under an\r\nexact parity of all circumstances. Farther, if the prism G H I be more\r\nturned about, ’till the blue-making rays pass through the hole L, these\r\nshall fall upon the surface Q R below I, as at _v_, and therefore are\r\nsubjected to a less refraction than the indigo-making rays. And thus\r\nby proceeding it will be found that the green-making rays are less\r\nrefracted than the blue-making rays, and so of the rest, according to\r\nthe order in which they lie in the coloured spectrum.\r\n\r\n4. THIS disposition of the different coloured rays to be refracted\r\nsome more than others our author calls their respective degrees of\r\nrefrangibility. And since this difference of refrangibility discovers\r\nit self to be so regular, the next step is to find the rule it observes.\r\n\r\n5. IT is a common principle in optics, that the sine of the angle of\r\nincidence bears to the sine of the refracted angle a given proportion.\r\nIf A B (in fig. 131, 132) represent the surface of any refracting\r\nsubstance, suppose of water or glass, and C D a ray of light incident\r\nupon that face in the point D, let D E be the ray, after it has passed\r\nthe surface A B; if the ray pass out of the air into the substance\r\nwhose surface is A B (as in fig. 131) it shall be turned from the\r\nsurface, and if it pass out of that substance into air it shall be\r\nbent towards it (as in fig. 132) But if F G be drawn through the point\r\nD perpendicular to the surface A B, the angle under C D F made by the\r\nincident ray and this perpendicular is called the angle of incidence;\r\nand the angle under E D G, made by this perpendicular and the ray after\r\nrefraction, is called the refracted angle. And if the circle H F I G\r\nbe described with any interval cutting C D in H and D E in I, then\r\nthe perpendiculars H K, I L being let fall upon F G, H K is called\r\nthe sine of the angle under C D F the angle of incidence, and I L the\r\nsine of the angle under E D G the refracted angle. The first of these\r\nsines is called the sine of the angle of incidence, or more briefly the\r\nsine of incidence, the latter is the sine of the refracted angle, or\r\nthe sine of refraction. And it has been found by numerous experiments\r\nthat whatever proportion the sine of incidence H K bears to the sine\r\nof refraction I L in any one case, the same proportion shall hold in\r\nall cases; that is, the proportion between these sines will remain\r\nunalterably the same in the same refracting substance, whatever be the\r\nmagnitude of the angle under C D F.\r\n\r\n6. BUT now because optical writers did not observe that every beam of\r\nwhite light was divided by refraction, as has been here explained,\r\nthis rule collected by them can only be understood in the gross of the\r\nwhole beam after refraction, and not so much of any particular part\r\nof it, or at most only of the middle part of the beam. It therefore\r\nwas incumbent upon our author to find by what law the rays were parted\r\nfrom each other; whether each ray apart obtained this property, and\r\nthat the separation was made by the proportion between the sines of\r\nincidence and refraction being in each species of rays different; or\r\nwhether the light was divided by some other rule. But he proves by a\r\ncertain experiment that each ray has its sine of incidence proportional\r\nto its sine of refraction; and farther shews by mathematical reasoning,\r\nthat it must be so upon condition only that bodies refract the light\r\nby acting upon it, in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the\r\nrefracting body, and upon the same sort of rays always in an equal\r\ndegree at the same distances[314].\r\n\r\n7. OUR great author teaches in the next place how from the refraction\r\nof the most refrangible and least refrangible rays to find the\r\nrefraction of all the intermediate ones[315]. The method is this:\r\nif the sine of incidence be to the sine of refraction in the least\r\nrefrangible rays as A to B C, (in fig. 133) and to the sine of\r\nrefraction in the most refrangible as A to B D; if C E be taken equal\r\nto C D, and then E D be so divided in F, G, H, I, K, L, that E D, E\r\nF, E G, E H, E I, E K, E L, E C, shall be proportional to the eight\r\nlengths of musical chords, which found the notes in an octave, E D\r\nbeing the length of the key, E F the length of the tone above that\r\nkey, E G the length of the lesser third, E H of the fourth, E I of the\r\nfifth, E K of the greater sixth, E L of the seventh, and E C of the\r\noctave above that key; that is if the lines E D, E F, E G, E H, E I, E\r\nK, E L, and E C bear the same proportion as the numbers, 1, 9/8, 5/6,\r\n¾, ⅓, ¾, 9/61, ½, respectively then shall B D, B F, be the two limits\r\nof the sines of refraction of the violet-making rays, that is the\r\nviolet-making rays shall not all of them have precisely the same sine\r\nof refraction, but none of them shall have a greater sine than B D,\r\nnor a less than B F, though there are violet-making rays which answer\r\nto any sine of refraction that can be taken between these two. In the\r\nsame manner B F and B G are the limits of the sines of refraction\r\nof the indigo-making rays; B G, B H are the limits belonging to the\r\nblue-making rays; B H, B I the limits pertaining to the green-making\r\nrays, B I, B K the limits for the yellow-making rays; B K, B L the\r\nlimits for the orange-making rays; and lastly, B L and B C the extreme\r\nlimits of the sines of refraction belonging to the red-making rays.\r\nThese are the proportions by which the heterogeneous rays of light are\r\nseparated from each other in refraction.\r\n\r\n8. WHEN light passes out of glass into air, our author found A to B C\r\nas 50 to 77, and the same A to B D as 50 to 78. And when it goes out\r\nof any other refracting substance into air, the excess of the sine\r\nof refraction of any one species of rays above its sine of incidence\r\nbears a constant proportion, which holds the same in each species, to\r\nthe excess of the sine of refraction of the same sort of rays above\r\nthe sine of incidence into the air out of glass; provided the sines\r\nof incidence both in glass and the other substance are equal. This\r\nour author verified by transmitting the light through prisms of glass\r\nincluded within a prismatic vessel of water; and draws from those\r\nexperiments the following observations: that whenever the light in\r\npassing through so many surfaces parting diverse transparent substances\r\nis by contrary refractions made to emerge into the air in a direction\r\nparallel to that of its incidence, it will appear afterwards white at\r\nany distance from the prisms, where you shall please to examine it;\r\nbut if the direction of its emergence be oblique to its incidence, in\r\nreceding from the place of emergence its edges shall appear tinged with\r\ncolours: which proves that in the first case there is no inequality\r\nin the refractions of each species of rays, but that when any one\r\nspecies is so refracted as to emerge parallel to the incident rays,\r\nevery sort of rays after refraction shall likewise be parallel to the\r\nsame incident rays, and to each other; whereas on the contrary, if the\r\nrays of any one sort are oblique to the incident light, the several\r\nspecies shall be oblique to each other, and be gradually separated by\r\nthat obliquity. From hence he deduces both the forementioned theorem,\r\nand also this other; that in each sort of rays the proportion of the\r\nsine of incidence to the sine of refraction, in the passage of the ray\r\nout of any refracting substance into another, is compounded of the\r\nproportion to which the sine of incidence would have to the sine of\r\nrefraction in the passage of that ray out of the first substance into\r\nany third, and of the proportion which the sine of incidence would\r\nhave to the sine of refraction in the passage of the ray out of that\r\nthird substance into the second. From so simple and plain an experiment\r\nhas our most judicious author deduced these important theorems, by\r\nwhich we may learn how very exact and circumspect he has been in this\r\nwhole work of his optics; that notwithstanding his great particularity\r\nin explaining his doctrine, and the numerous collection of experiments\r\nhe has made to clear up every doubt which could arise, yet at the same\r\ntime he has used the greatest caution to make out every thing by the\r\nsimplest and easiest means possible.\r\n\r\n9. OUR author adds but one remark more upon refraction, which is, that\r\nif refraction be performed in the manner he has supposed from the\r\nlight’s being pressed by the refracting power perpendicularly toward\r\nthe surface of the refracting body, and consequently be made to move\r\nswifter in the body than before its incidence; whether this power act\r\nequally at all distances or otherwise, provided only its power in the\r\nsame body at the same distances remain without variation the same in\r\none inclination of the incident rays as well as another; he observes\r\nthat the refracting powers in different bodies will be in the duplicate\r\nproportion of the tangents of the lead angles, which the refracted\r\nlight can make with the surfaces of the refracting bodies[316].\r\nThis observation may be explained thus. When the light passes into\r\nany refracting substance, it has been shewn above that the sine of\r\nincidence bears a constant proportion to the sine of refraction.\r\nSuppose the light to pass to the refracting body A B C D (in fig.\r\n134) in the line E F, and to fall upon it at the point F, and then to\r\nproceed within the body in the line F G. Let H I be drawn through F\r\nperpendicular to the surface A B, and any circle K L M N be described\r\nto the center F. Then from the points O and P where this circle cuts\r\nthe incident and refracted ray, the perpendiculars O Q, P R being\r\ndrawn, the proportion of O Q to P R will remain the same in all the\r\ndifferent obliquities, in which the same ray of light can fall on the\r\nsurface A B. Now O Q is less than F L the semidiameter of the circle K\r\nL M N, but the more the ray E F is inclined down toward the surface A\r\nB, the greater will O Q be, and will approach nearer to the magnitude\r\nof F L. But the proportion of O Q to P R remaining always the same,\r\nwhen O Q, is largest, P R will also be greatest; so that the more the\r\nincident ray E F is inclined toward the surface A B, the more the ray\r\nF G after refraction will be inclined toward the same. Now if the line\r\nF S T be so drawn, that S V being perpendicular to F I shall be to F L\r\nthe semidiameter of the circle in the constant proportion of P R to O\r\nQ; then the angle under N F T is that which I meant by the least of all\r\nthat can be made by the refracted ray with this surface, for the ray\r\nafter refraction would proceed in this line, if it were to come to the\r\npoint F lying on the very surface A B; for if the incident ray came to\r\nthe point F in any line between A F and F H, the ray after refraction\r\nwould proceed forward in some line between F T and F I. Here if N W\r\nbe drawn perpendicular to F N, this line N W in the circle K L M N is\r\ncalled the tangent of the angle under N F S. Thus much being premised,\r\nthe sense of the forementioned proposition is this. Let there be two\r\nrefracting substances (in fig. 135) A B C D, and E F G H. Take a point,\r\nas I, in the surface A B, and to the center I with any semidiameter\r\ndescribe the circle K L M. In like manner on the surface E F take\r\nsome point N, as a center, and describe with the same semidiameter\r\nthe circle O P Q. Let the angle under B I R be the least which the\r\nrefracted light can make with the surface A B, and the angle under F N\r\nS the least which the refracted light can make with the surface E F.\r\nThen if L T be drawn perpendicular to A B, and P V perpendicular to E\r\nF; the whole power, wherewith the substance A B C D acts on the light,\r\nwill bear to the whole power wherewith the substance E F G H acts on,\r\nthe light, a proportion, which is duplicate of the proportion, which L\r\nT bears to P V.\r\n\r\n10. UPON comparing according to this rule the refractive powers of a\r\ngreat many bodies it is found, that unctuous bodies which abound most\r\nwith sulphureous parts refract the light two or three times more in\r\nproportion to their density than others: but that those bodies, which\r\nseem to receive in their composition like proportions of sulphureous\r\nparts, have their refractive powers proportional to their densities; as\r\nappears beyond contradiction by comparing the refractive power of so\r\nrare a substance as the air with that of common glass or rock crystal,\r\nthough these substances are 2000 times denser than air; nay the same\r\nproportion is found to hold without sensible difference in comparing\r\nair with pseudo-topar and glass of antimony, though the pseudo-topar\r\nbe 3500 times denser than air, and glass of antimony no less than\r\n4400 times denser. This power in other substances, as salts, common\r\nwater, spirit of wine, &c. seems to bear a greater proportion to their\r\ndensities than these last named, according as they abound with sulphurs\r\nmore than these; which makes our author conclude it probable, that\r\nbodies act upon the light chiefly, if not altogether, by means of the\r\nsulphurs in them; which kind of substances it is likely enters in some\r\ndegree the composition of all bodies. Of all the substances examined\r\nby our author, none has so great a refractive power, in respect of its\r\ndensity, as a diamond.\r\n\r\n11. OUR author finishes these remarks, and all he offers relating to\r\nrefraction, with observing, that the action between light and bodies is\r\nmutual, since sulphureous bodies, which are most readily set on fire\r\nby the sun’s light, when collected upon them with a burning glass, act\r\nmore upon light in refracting it, than other bodies of the same density\r\ndo. And farther, that the densest bodies, which have been now shewn to\r\nact most upon light, contract the greatest heat by being exposed to the\r\nsummer sun.\r\n\r\n12. HAVING thus dispatched what relates to refraction, we must address\r\nourselves to discourse of the other operation of bodies upon light\r\nin reflecting it. When light passes through a surface, which divides\r\ntwo transparent bodies differing in density, part of it only is\r\ntransmitted, another part being reflected. And if the light pass out\r\nof the denser body into the rarer, by being much inclined to the\r\nforesaid surface at length no part of it shall pass through, but be\r\ntotally reflected. Now that part of the light, which suffers the\r\ngreatest refraction, shall be wholly reflected with a less obliquity\r\nof the rays, than the parts of the light which undergo a less degree\r\nof refraction; as is evident from the last experiment recited in the\r\nfirst chapter; where, as the prisms D E F, G H I, (in fig. 129.) were\r\nturned about, the violet light was first totally reflected, and then\r\nthe blue, next to that the green, and so of the rest. In consequence\r\nof which our author lays down this proportion; that the sun’s light\r\ndiffers in reflexibility, those rays being most reflexible, which are\r\nmost refrangible. And collects from this, in conjunction with other\r\narguments, that the refraction and reflection, of light are produced\r\nby the same cause, compassing those different effects only by the\r\ndifference of circumstances with which it is attended. Another proof\r\nof this being taken by our author from what he has discovered of\r\nthe passage of light through thin transparent plates, viz. that any\r\nparticular species of light, suppose, for instance, the red-making\r\nrays, will enter and pass out of such a plate, if that plate be of\r\nsome certain thicknesses; but if it be of other thicknesses, it will\r\nnot break through it, but be reflected back: in which is seen, that\r\nthe thickness of the plate determines whether the power, by which that\r\nplate acts upon the light, shall reflect it, or suffer it to pass\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n13. BUT this last mentioned surprising property of the action between\r\nlight and bodies affords the reason of all that has been said in the\r\npreceding chapter concerning the colours of natural bodies; and must\r\ntherefore more particularly be illustrated and explained, as being what\r\nwill principally unfold the nature of the action of bodies upon light.\r\n\r\n14. TO begin: The object glass of a long telescope being laid upon a\r\nplane glass, as proposed in the foregoing chapter, in open day-light\r\nthere will be exhibited rings of various colours, as was there related;\r\nbut if in a darkened room the coloured spectrum be formed by the prism,\r\nas in the first experiment of the first chapter, and the glasses be\r\nilluminated by a reflection from the spectrum, the rings shall not\r\nin this case exhibit the diversity of colours before described, but\r\nappear all of the colour of the light which falls upon the glasses,\r\nhaving dark rings between. Which shews that the thin plate of air\r\nbetween the glasses at some thicknesses reflects the incident light,\r\nat other places does not reflect it, but is found in those places to\r\ngive the light passage; for by holding the glasses in the light as\r\nit passes from the prism to the spectrum, suppose at such a distance\r\nfrom the prism that the several sorts of light must be sufficiently\r\nseparated from each other, when any particular sort of light falls\r\non the glasses, you will find by holding a piece of white paper at a\r\nsmall distance beyond the glasses, that at those intervals, where the\r\ndark lines appeared upon the glasses, the light is so transmitted,\r\nas to paint upon the paper rings of light having that colour which\r\nfalls upon the glasses. This experiment therefore opens to us this\r\nvery strange property of reflection, that in these thin plates it\r\nshould bear such a relation to the thickness of the plate, as is here\r\nshewn. Farther, by carefully measuring the diameters of each ring it\r\nis found, that whereas the glasses touch where the dark spot appears\r\nin the center of the rings made by reflexion, where the air is of\r\ntwice the thickness at which the light of the first ring is reflected,\r\nthere the light by being again transmitted makes the first dark ring;\r\nwhere the plate has three times that thickness which exhibits the\r\nfirst lucid ring, it again reflects the light forming the second lucid\r\nring; when the thickness is four times the first, the light is again\r\ntransmitted so as to make the second dark ring; where the air is five\r\ntimes the first thickness, the third lucid ring is made; where it has\r\nsix times the thickness, the third dark ring appears, and so on: in\r\nso much that the thicknesses, at which the light is reflected, are\r\nin proportion to the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. and the thicknesses,\r\nwhere the light is transmitted, are in the proportion of the numbers\r\n0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And these proportions between the thicknesses which\r\nreflect and transmit the light remain the same in all situations of the\r\neye, as well when the rings are viewed obliquely, as when looked on\r\nperpendicularly. We must farther here observe, that the light, when it\r\nis reflected, as well as when it is transmitted, enters the thin plate,\r\nand is reflected from its farther surface; because, as was before\r\nremarked, the altering the transparent body behind the farther surface\r\nalters the degree of reflection as when a thin piece of Muscovy glass\r\nhas its farther surface wet with water, and the colour of the glass\r\nmade dimmer by being so wet; which shews that the light reaches to the\r\nwater, otherwise its reflection could not be influenced by it. But\r\nyet this reflection depends upon some power propagated from the first\r\nsurface to the second; for though made at the second surface it depends\r\nalso upon the first, because it depends upon the distance between the\r\nsurfaces; and besides, the body through which the light passes to the\r\nfirst surface influences the reflection: for in a plate of Muscovy\r\nglass, wetting the surface, which first receives the light, diminishes\r\nthe reflection, though not quite so much as wetting the farther surface\r\nwill do. Since therefore the light in passing through these thin plates\r\nat some thicknesses is reflected, but at others transmitted without\r\nreflection, it is evident, that this reflection is caused by some\r\npower propagated from the first surface, which intermits and returns\r\nsuccessively. Thus is every ray apart disposed to alternate reflections\r\nand transmissions at equal intervals; the successive returns of which\r\ndisposition our author calls the fits of easy reflection, and of easy\r\ntransmission. But these fits, which observe the same law of returning\r\nat equal intervals, whether the plates are viewed perpendicularly or\r\nobliquely, in different situations of the eye change their magnitude.\r\nFor what was observed before in respect of those rings, which appear\r\nin open day-light, holds likewise in these rings exhibited by simple\r\nlights; namely, that these two alter in bigness according to the\r\ndifferent angle under which they are seen: and our author lays down a\r\nrule whereby to determine the thicknesses of the plate of air, which\r\nshall exhibit the same colour under different oblique views[317]. And\r\nthe thickness of the aereal plate, which in different inclinations of\r\nthe rays will exhibit to the eye in open day-light the same colour, is\r\nalso varied by the same rule[318]. He contrived farther a method of\r\ncomparing in the bubble of water the proportion between the thickness\r\nof its coat, which exhibited any colour when seen perpendicularly,\r\nto the thickness of it, where the same colour appeared by an oblique\r\nview; and he found the same rule to obtain here likewise[319]. But\r\nfarther, if the glasses be enlightened successively by all the several\r\nspecies of light, the rings will appear of different magnitudes; in\r\nthe red light they will be larger than in the orange colour, in that\r\nlarger than in the yellow, in the yellow larger than in the green,\r\nless in the blue, less yet in the indigo, and least of all in the\r\nviolet: which shew that the same thickness of the aereal plate is not\r\nfitted to reflect all colours, but that one colour is reflected where\r\nanother would have been transmitted; and as the rays which are most\r\nstrongly refracted form the least rings, a rule is laid down by our\r\nauthor for determining the relation, which the degree of refraction of\r\neach species of colour has to the thicknesses of the plate where it is\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\n15. FROM these observations our author shews the reason of that great\r\nvariety of colours, which appears in these thin plates in the open\r\nwhite light of the day. For when this white light falls on the plate,\r\neach part of the light forms rings of its own colour; and the rings\r\nof the different colours not being of the same bigness are variously\r\nintermixed, and form a great variety of tints[320].\r\n\r\n16. IN certain experiments, which our author made with thick glasses,\r\nhe found, that these fits of easy reflection and transmission returned\r\nfor some thousands of times, and thereby farther confirmed his\r\nreasoning concerning them[321].\r\n\r\n17. UPON the whole, our great author concludes from some of the\r\nexperiments made by him, that the reason why all transparent bodies\r\nrefract part of the light incident upon them, and reflect another\r\npart, is, because some of the light, when it comes to the surface of\r\nthe body, is in a fit of easy transmission, and some part of it in\r\na fit of easy reflection; and from the durableness of these fits he\r\nthinks it probable, that the light is put into these fits from their\r\nfirst emission out of the luminous body; and that these fits continue\r\nto return at equal intervals without end, unless those intervals be\r\nchanged by the light’s entring into some refracting substance[322]. He\r\nlikewise has taught how to determine the change which is made of the\r\nintervals of the fits of easy transmission and reflection, when the\r\nlight passes out of one transparent space or substance into another.\r\nHis rule is, that when the light passes perpendicularly to the surface,\r\nwhich parts any two transparent substances, these intervals in the\r\nsubstance, out of which the light passes, bear to the intervals in the\r\nsubstance, whereinto the light enters, the same proportion, as the sine\r\nof incidence bears to the sine of refraction[323]. It is farther to be\r\nobserved, that though the fits of easy reflection return at constant\r\nintervals, yet the reflecting power never operates, but at or near a\r\nsurface where the light would suffer refraction; and if the thickness\r\nof any transparent body shall be less than the intervals of the fits,\r\nthose intervals shall scarce be disturbed by such a body, but the light\r\nshall pass through without any reflection[324].\r\n\r\n18. WHAT the power in nature is, whereby this action between light and\r\nbodies is caused, our author has not discovered. But the effects, which\r\nhe has discovered, of this power are very surprising, and altogether\r\nwide from any conjectures that had ever been framed concerning it; and\r\nfrom these discoveries of his no doubt this power is to be deduced,\r\nif we ever can come to the knowledge of it. Sir ISAAC NEWTON has in\r\ngeneral hinted at his opinion concerning it; that probably it is\r\nowing to some very subtle and elastic substance diffused through the\r\nuniverse, in which such vibrations may be excited by the rays of\r\nlight, as they pass through it, that shall occasion it to operate so\r\ndifferently upon the light in different places as to give rise to these\r\nalternate fits of reflection and transmission, of which we have now\r\nbeen speaking[325]. He is of opinion, that such a substance may produce\r\nthis and other effects also in nature, though it be so rare as not to\r\ngive any sensible resistance to bodies in motion[326]; and therefore\r\nnot inconsistent with what has been said above, that the planets move\r\nin spaces free from resistance[327].\r\n\r\n19. IN order for the more full discovery of this action between light\r\nand bodies, our author began another set of experiments, wherein he\r\nfound the light to be acted on as it passes near the edges of solid\r\nbodies; in particular all small bodies, such as the hairs of a man’s\r\nhead or the like, held in a very small beam of the sun’s light, cast\r\nextremely broad shadows. And in one of these experiments the shadow\r\nwas 35 times the breadth of the body[328]. These shadows are also\r\nobserved to be bordered with colours[329]. This our author calls the\r\ninflection of light; but as he informs us, that he was interrupted\r\nfrom prosecuting these experiments to any length, I need not detain my\r\nreaders with a more particular account of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP. IV.~\r\n\r\nOf OPTIC GLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ~ISAAC NEWTON~ having deduced from his doctrine of light and\r\ncolours a surprising improvement of telescopes, of which I intend\r\nhere to give an account, I shall first premise something in general\r\nconcerning those instruments.\r\n\r\n2. IT will be understood from what has been said above, that when light\r\nfalls upon the surface of glass obliquely, after its entrance into\r\nthe glass it is more inclined to the line drawn through the point of\r\nincidence perpendicular to that surface, than before. Suppose a ray of\r\nlight issuing from the point A (in fig. 136) falls on a piece of glass\r\nB C D E, whose surface B C, whereon the ray falls, is of a spherical\r\nor globular figure, the center whereof is F. Let the ray proceed in\r\nthe line A G falling on the surface B C in the point G, and draw F G\r\nH. Here the ray after its entrance into the glass will pass on in some\r\nline, as G I, more inclined toward the line F G H that the line A G is\r\ninclined thereto; for the line F G H is perpendicular to the surface B\r\nC in the point G. By this means, if a number of rays proceeding from\r\nany one point fall on a convex spherical surface of glass, they shall\r\nbe inflected (as is represented in fig. 137,) so as to be gathered\r\npretty close together about the line drawn through the center of the\r\nglass from the point, whence the rays proceed; which line henceforward\r\nwe shall call the axis of the glass: or the point from whence the rays\r\nproceed may be so near the glass, that the rays shall after entring the\r\nglass still go on to spread themselves, but not so much as before; so\r\nthat if the rays were to be continued backward (as in fig. 138,) they\r\nshould gather together about the axis at a place more remote from the\r\nglass, than the point is, whence they actually proceed. In these and\r\nthe following figures A denotes the point to which the rays are related\r\nbefore refraction, B the point to which they are directed afterwards,\r\nand C the center of the refracting surface. Here we may observe, that\r\nit is possible to form the glass of such a figure, that all the rays\r\nwhich proceed from one point shall after refraction be reduced again\r\nexactly into one point on the axis of the glass. But in glasses of a\r\nspherical form though this does not happen; yet the rays, which fall\r\nwithin a moderate distance from the axis, will unite extremely near\r\ntogether. If the light fall on a concave spherical surface, after\r\nrefraction it shall spread quicker than before (as in fig. 139,) unless\r\nthe rays proceed from a point between the center and the surface of the\r\nglass. If we suppose the rays of light, which fall upon the glass, not\r\nto proceed from any point, but to move so as to tend all to some point\r\nin the axis of the glass beyond the surface; if the glass have a convex\r\nsurface, the rays shall unite about the axis sooner, than otherwise\r\nthey would do (as in fig. 140,) unless the point to which they tended\r\nwas between the surface and the center of that surface. But if the\r\nsurface be concave, they shall not meet so soon: nay perhaps converge.\r\n(See fig. 141 and 142.)\r\n\r\n5. FARTHER, because the light in passing out of glass into the air is\r\nturned by the refraction farther off from the line drawn through the\r\npoint of incidence perpendicular to the refracting surface, than it was\r\nbefore; the light which spreads from a point shall by parting through\r\na convex surface of glass into the air be made either to spread less\r\nthan before (as in fig. 143,) or to gather about the axis beyond the\r\nglass (as in fig. 144.) But if the rays of light were proceeding to a\r\npoint in the axis of the glass, they should by the refraction be made\r\nto unite sooner about that axis (as in fig. 145.) If the surface of\r\nthe glass be concave, rays which proceed from a point shall be made to\r\nspread faster (as in fig 146,) but rays which are tending to a point in\r\nthe axis of the glass, shall be made to gather about the axis farther\r\nfrom the glass (as in fig. 147) or even to diverge (as in fig. 148,)\r\nunless the point, to which the rays are directed, lies between the\r\nsurface of the glass and its center.\r\n\r\n4. THE rays, which spread themselves from a point, are called\r\ndiverging; and such as move toward a point, are called converging rays.\r\nAnd the point in the axis of the glass, about which the rays gather\r\nafter refraction, is called the focus of those rays.\r\n\r\n5. IF a glass be formed of two convex spherical surfaces (as in fig.\r\n149,) where the glass AB is formed of the surfaces A C B and A D B, the\r\nline drawn through the centers of the two surfaces, as the line E F, is\r\ncalled the axis of the glass; and rays, which diverge from any point of\r\nthis axis, by the refraction of the glass will be caused to converge\r\ntoward some part of the axis, or at least to diverge as from a point\r\nmore remote from the glass, than that from whence they proceeded; for\r\nthe two surfaces both conspire to produce this effect upon the rays.\r\nBut converging rays will be caused by such a glass as this to converge\r\nsooner. If a glass be formed of two concave surfaces, as the glass A\r\nB (in fig. 150,) the line C D drawn through the centers, to which the\r\ntwo surfaces are formed, is called the axis of the glass. Such a glass\r\nshall cause diverging rays, which proceed from any point in the axis\r\nof the glass, to diverge much more, as if they came from some place in\r\nthe axis of the glass nearer to it than the point, whence the rays\r\nactually proceed. But converging rays will be made either to converge\r\nless, or even to diverge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n6. IN these glasses rays, which proceed from any point near the axis,\r\nwill be affected as it were in the same manner, as if they proceeded\r\nfrom the very axis it self, and such as converge toward a point at a\r\nsmall distance from the axis will suffer much the same effects from\r\nthe glass, as if they converged to some point in the very axis. By\r\nthis means any luminous body exposed to a convex glass may have an\r\nimage formed upon any white body held beyond the glass. This may be\r\neasily tried with a common spectacle-glass. For if such a glass be held\r\nbetween a candle and a piece of white paper, if the distances of the\r\ncandle, glass, and paper be properly adjusted, the image of the candle\r\nwill appear very distinctly upon the paper, but be seen inverted; the\r\nreason whereof is this. Let A B (in fig. 151) be the glass, C D an\r\nobject placed cross the axis of the glass. Let the rays of light, which\r\nissue from the point E, where the axis of the glass crosses the object,\r\nbe so refracted by the glass, as to meet again about the point F. The\r\nrays, which diverge from the point C of the object, shall meet again\r\nalmost at the same distance from the glass, but on the other side of\r\nthe axis, as at G; for the rays at the glass cross the axis. In like\r\nmanner the rays, which proceed from the point D, will meet about H on\r\nthe other side of the axis. None of these rays, neither those which\r\nproceed from the point E in the axis, nor those which issue from C or\r\nD, will meet again exactly in one point; but yet in one place, as is\r\nhere supposed at F, G, and H, they will be crouded so close together,\r\nas to make a distinct image of the object upon any body proper to\r\nreflect it, which shall be held there.\r\n\r\n7. IF the object be too near the glass for the rays to converge after\r\nthe refraction, the rays shall issue out of the glass, as if they\r\ndiverged from a point more distant from the glass, than that from\r\nwhence they really proceed (as in fig. 152,) where the rays coming from\r\nthe point E of the object, which lies on the axis of the glass A B,\r\nissue out of the glass, as if they came from the point F more remote\r\nfrom the glass than E; and the rays proceeding from the point C issue\r\nout of the glass, as if they proceeded from the point G; likewise the\r\nrays which issue from the point D emerge out of the glass, as if they\r\ncame from the point H. Here the point G is on the same side of the\r\naxis, as the point C; and the point H on the same side, as the point\r\nD. In this case to an eye placed beyond the glass the object should\r\nappear, as if it were in the situation G F H.\r\n\r\n8. IF the glass A B had been concave (as in, fig. 153,) to an eye\r\nbeyond the glass the object C D would appear in the situation G H,\r\nnearer to the glass than really it is. Here also the object will not be\r\ninverted; but the point G is on the same side the axe with the point C,\r\nand H on the same side as D.\r\n\r\n9. HENCE may be understood, why spectacles made with convex glasses\r\nhelp the sight in old age: for the eye in that age becomes unfit to\r\nsee objects distinctly, except such as are remov’d to a very great\r\ndistance; whence all men, when they first stand in need of spectacles,\r\nare observed to read at arm’s length, and to hold the object at a\r\ngreater distance, than they used to do before. But when an object is\r\nremoved at too great a distance from the sight, it cannot be seen\r\nclearly, by reason that a less quantity of light from the object will\r\nenter the eye, and the whole object will also appear smaller. Now by\r\nhelp of a convex glass an object may be held near, and yet the rays of\r\nlight issuing from it will enter the eye, as if the object were farther\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n10. AFTER the same manner concave glasses assist such, as are short\r\nsighted. For these require the object to be brought inconveniently near\r\nto the eye, in order to their seeing it distinctly; but by such a glass\r\nthe object may be removed to a proper distance, and yet the rays of\r\nlight enter the eye, as if they came from a place much nearer.\r\n\r\n11. WHENCE these defects of the sight arise, that in old age\r\nobjects cannot be seen distinct within a moderate distance, and in\r\nshort-sightedness not without being brought too near, will be easily\r\nunderstood, when the manner of vision in general shall be explain’d;\r\nwhich I shall now endeavour to do, in order to be better understood in\r\nwhat follows. The eye is form’d, as is represented in fig. 154. It is\r\nof a globular figure, the fore part whereof scarce more protuberant\r\nthan the rest is transparent. Underneath this transparent part is a\r\nsmall collection of an humour in appearance like water, and it has also\r\nthe same refractive power as common water; this is called the aqueous\r\nhumour, and fills the space A B C D in the figure. Next beyond lies the\r\nbody D E F G; this is solid but transparent, it is composed with two\r\nconvex surfaces, the hinder surface E F G being more convex, than the\r\nanterior E D G. Between the outer membrane A B C, and this body E D G\r\nF is placed that membrane, which exhibits the colours, that are seen\r\nround the sight of the eye; and the black spot, which is called the\r\nsight or pupil, is a hole in this membrane, through which the light\r\nenters, whereby we see. This membrane is fixed only by its outward\r\ncircuit, and has a muscular power, whereby it dilates the pupil in\r\na weak light, and contracts it in a strong one. The body D E F G is\r\ncalled the crystalline humour, and has a greater refracting power than\r\nwater. Behind this the bulk of the eye is filled up with what is called\r\nthe vitreous humor, this has much the same refractive power with water.\r\nAt the bottom of the eye toward the inner side next the nose the optic\r\nglass enters, as at H, and spreads it self all over the inside of the\r\neye, till within a small diftance from A and C. Now any object, as I K,\r\nbeing placed before the eye, the rays of light issuing from each point\r\nof this object are so refracted by the convex surface of the aqueous\r\nhumour, as to be caused to converge; after this being received by the\r\nconvex surface E D G of the crystalline humour, which has a greater\r\nrefractive power than the aqueous, the rays, when they are entered into\r\nthis surface, still more converge, and at going out of the surface E F\r\nG into a humour of a less refractive power than the crystalline they\r\nare made to converge yet farther. By all these successive refractions\r\nthey are brought to converge at the bottom of the eye, so that a\r\ndistinct image of the object as L M is impress’d on the nerve. And by\r\nthis means the object is seen.\r\n\r\n11. IT has been made a difficulty, that the image of the object\r\nimpressed on the nerve is inverted, so that the upper part of the image\r\nis impressed on the lower part of the eye. But this difficulty, I\r\nthink, can no longer remain, if we only consider, that upper and lower\r\nare terms merely relative to the ordinary position of our bodies: and\r\nour bodies, when view’d by the eye, have their image as much inverted\r\nas other objects; so that the image of our own bodies, and of other\r\nobjects, are impressed on the eye in the same relation to one another,\r\nas they really have.\r\n\r\n12. THE eye can see objects equally distinct at very different\r\ndistances, but in one distance only at the same time. That the eye may\r\naccomodate itself to different distances, some change in its humours\r\nis requir’d. It is my opinion, that this change is made in the figure\r\nof the crystalline humour, as I have indeavoured to prove in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n13. IF any of the humours of the eye are too flat, they will refract\r\nthe light too little; which is the case in old age. If they are too\r\nconvex, they refract too much; as in those who are short-sighted.\r\n\r\n14. THE manner of direct vision being thus explained, I proceed to give\r\nsome account of telescopes, by which we view more distinctly remote\r\nobjects; and also of microscopes, whereby we magnify the appearance of\r\nsmall objects. In the first place, the most simple sort of telescope\r\nis composed of two glasses, either both convex, or one convex, and the\r\nother concave. (The first sort of these is represented in fig. 155, the\r\nlatter in fig. 156.)\r\n\r\n15. IN fig. 155 let A B represent the convex glass next the object, C\r\nD the other glass more convex near the eye. Suppose the object-glass A\r\nB to form the image of the object at E F; so that if a sheet of white\r\npaper were to be held in this place, the object would appear. Now\r\nsuppose the rays, which pass the glass A B, and are united about F, to\r\nproceed to the eye glass C D, and be there refracted. Three only of\r\nthese rays are drawn in the figure, those which pass by the extremities\r\nof the glass A B, and that which passes its middle. If the glass C D\r\nbe placed at such a distance from the image E F, that the rays, which\r\npass by the point F, after having proceeded through the glass diverge\r\nso much, as the rays do that come from an object, which is at such a\r\ndistance from the eye as to be seen distinctly, these being received\r\nby the eye will make on the bottom of the eye a distinct representation\r\nof the point F. In like manner the rays, which pass through the object\r\nglass A B to the point E after proceeding through the eye-glass C D\r\nwill on the bottom of the eye make a distinct representation of the\r\npoint E. But if the eye be placed where these rays, which proceed from\r\nE, cross those, which proceed from F, the eye will receive the distinct\r\nimpression of both these points at the same time; and consequently\r\nwill also receive a distinct impression from all the intermediate\r\nparts of the image E F, that is, the eye will see the object, to which\r\nthe telescope is directed, distinctly. The place of the eye is about\r\nthe point G, where the rays H E, H F cross, which pass through the\r\nmiddle of the object-glass A B to the points E and F; or at the place\r\nwhere the focus would be formed by rays coming from the point H, and\r\nrefracted by the glass C D. To judge how much this instrument magnifies\r\nany object, we must first observe, that the angle under E H F, in which\r\nthe eye at the point H would see the image E F, is nearly the same as\r\nthe angle, under which the object appears by direct vision; but when\r\nthe eye is in G, and views the object through the telescope, it sees\r\nthe same under a greater angle; for the rays, which coming from E and F\r\ncross in G, make a greater angle than the rays, which proceed from the\r\npoint H to these points E and F. The angle at G is greater than that at\r\nH in the proportion, as the distance between the glasses A B and C D is\r\ngreater than the distance of the point G from the glass C D.\r\n\r\n16. THIS telescope inverts the object; for the rays, which came from\r\nthe right-hand side of the object, go to the point E the left side of\r\nthe image; and the rays, which come from the left side of the object,\r\ngo to F the right side of the image. These rays cross again in G, so\r\nthat the rays, which come from the right side of the object, go to the\r\nright side of the eye; and the rays from the left side of the object go\r\nto the left side of the eye. Therefore in this telescope the image in\r\nthe eye has the same situation as the object; and seeing that in direct\r\nvision the image in the eye has an inverted situation, here, where\r\nthe situation is not inverted, the object must appear so. This is no\r\ninconvenience to astronomers in celestial observations; but for objects\r\nhere on the earth it is usual to add two other convex glasses, which\r\nmay turn the object again (as is represented in fig. 157,) or else to\r\nuse the other kind of telescope with a concave eye-glass.\r\n\r\n17. IN this other kind of telescope the effect is founded on the same\r\nprinciples, as in the former. The distinctness of the appearance is\r\nprocured in the same manner. But here the eye-glass C D (in fig. 156)\r\nis placed between the image E F, and the object glass A B. By this\r\nmeans the rays, which come from the right-hand side of the object,\r\nand proceed toward E the left side of the image, being intercepted by\r\nthe eye-glass are carried to the left side of the eye; and the rays,\r\nwhich come from the left side of the object, go to the right side of\r\nthe eye; so that the impression in the eye being inverted the object\r\nappears in the same situation, as when view’d by the naked eye. The\r\neye must here be placed close to the glass. The degree of magnifying in\r\nthis instrument is thus to be found. Let the rays, which pass through\r\nthe glass A B at H, after the refraction of the eye-glass C D diverge,\r\nas if they came from the point G; then the rays, which come from the\r\nextremities of the object, enter the eye under the angle at G; so\r\nthat here also the object will be magnified in the proportion of the\r\ndistance between the glasses, to the distance of G from the eye-glass.\r\n\r\n18. THE space, that can be taken in at one view in this telescope,\r\ndepends on the breadth of the pupil of the eye; for as the rays, which\r\ngo to the points E, F of the image, are something distant from each\r\nother, when they come out of the glass C D, if they are wider asunder\r\nthan the pupil, it is evident, that they cannot both enter the eye\r\nat once. In the other telescope the eye is placed in the point G,\r\nwhere the rays that come from the points E or F cross each other, and\r\ntherefore must enter the eye together. On this account the telescope\r\nwith convex glasses takes in a larger view, than those with concave.\r\nBut in these also the extent of the view is limited, because the\r\neye-glass does not by the refraction towards its edges form so distinct\r\na representation of the object, as near the middle.\r\n\r\n18. MICROSCOPES are of two sorts. One kind is only a very convex glass,\r\nby the means of which the object may be brought very near the eye, and\r\nyet be seen distinctly. This microscope magnifies in proportion, as\r\nthe object by being brought near the eye will form a broader impression\r\non the optic nerve. The other kind made with convex glasses produces\r\nits effects in the same manner as the telescope. Let the object A B\r\n(in fig. 158) be placed under the glass C D, and by this glass let an\r\nimage be formed of this object. Above this image let the glass G H be\r\nplaced. By this glass let the rays, which proceed from the points A and\r\nB, be refracted, as is expressed in the figure. In particular, let the\r\nrays, which from each of these points pass through the middle of the\r\nglass C D, cross in I, and there let the eye be placed. Here the object\r\nwill appear larger, when seen through the microscope, than if that\r\ninstrument were removed, in proportion as the angle, in which these\r\nrays cross in I, is greater than the angle, which the lines would make,\r\nthat should be drawn from I to A and B; that is, in the proportion made\r\nup of the proportion of the distance of the object A B from I, to the\r\ndistance of I from the glass G H; and of the proportion of the distance\r\nbetween the glasses, to the distance of the object A B from the glass C\r\nD.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. I SHALL now proceed to explain the imperfection in these\r\ninstruments, occasioned by the different refrangibility of the light\r\nwhich comes from every object. This prevents the image of the object\r\nfrom being formed in the focus of the object glass with perfect\r\ndistinctness; so that if the eye-glass magnify the image overmuch,\r\nthe imperfections of it must be visible, and make the whole appear\r\nconfused. Our author more fully to satisfy himself, that the different\r\nrefrangibility of the several sorts of rays is sufficient to produce\r\nthis irregularity, underwent the labour of a very nice and difficult\r\nexperiment, whose process he has at large set down, to prove, that the\r\nrays of light are refracted as differently in the small refraction\r\nof telescope glasses as in the larger of the prism; so exceeding\r\ncareful has he been in searching out the true cause of this effect.\r\nAnd he used, I suppose, the greater caution, because another reason\r\nhad before been generally assigned for it. It was the opinion of all\r\nmathematicians, that this defect in telescopes arose from the figure,\r\nin which the glasses were formed; a spherical refracting surface not\r\ncollecting into an exact point all the rays which come from any one\r\npoint of an object, as has before been said[330]. But after our author\r\nhas proved, that in these small refractions, as well as in greater,\r\nthe sine of incidence into air out of glass, to the sine of refraction\r\nin the red-making rays, is as 50 to 77, and in the blue-making rays 50\r\nto 78; he proceeds to compare the inequalities of refraction arising\r\nfrom this different refrangibility of the rays, with the inequalities,\r\nwhich would follow from the figure of the glass, were light uniformly\r\nrefracted. For this purpose he observes, that if rays issuing from\r\na point so remote from the object glass of a telescope, as to be\r\nesteemed parallel, which is the case of the rays, which come from the\r\nheavenly bodies; then the distance from the glass of the point, in\r\nwhich the least refrangible rays are united, will be to the distance,\r\nat which the most refrangible rays unite, as 28 to 27; and therefore\r\nthat the least space, into which all the rays can be collected, will\r\nnot be less than the 55th part of the breadth of the glass. For if A\r\nB (in fig. 159) be the glass, C D its axis, E A, F B two rays of the\r\nlight parallel to that axis entring the glass near its edges; after\r\nrefraction let the least refrangible part of these rays meet in G,\r\nthe most refrangible in H; then, as has been said, G I will be to I\r\nH, as 28 to 27; that is, G H will be the 28th part of G I, and the\r\n27th part of H I; whence if K L be drawn through G, and M N through H,\r\nperpendicular to C D, M N will be the a 28th part of A B, the breadth\r\nof the glass, and K L the 27th part of the same; so that O P the least\r\nspace, into which the rays are gathered, will be about half the mean\r\nbetween these two, that is the 55th part of A B.\r\n\r\n20. THIS is the error arising from the different refrangibility\r\nof the rays of light, which our author finds vastly to exceed the\r\nother, consequent upon the figure of the glass. In particular, if the\r\ntelescope glass be flat on one side, and convex on the other; when the\r\nflat side is turned towards the object, by a theorem, which he has laid\r\ndown, the error from the figure comes out above 5000 times less than\r\nthe other. This other inequality is so great, that telescopes could\r\nnot perform so well as they do, were it not that the light does not\r\nequally fill all the space O P, over which it is scattered, but is much\r\nmore dense toward the middle of that space than at the extremities. And\r\nbesides, all the kinds of rays affect not the sense equally strong, the\r\nyellow and orange being the strongest, the red and green next to them,\r\nthe blue indigo and violet being much darker and fainter colours; and\r\nit is shewn that all the yellow and orange, and three fifths of the\r\nbrighter half of the red next the orange, and as great a share of the\r\nbrighter half of the green next the yellow, will be collected into a\r\nspace whose breadth is not above the 250th part of the breadth of the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd the remaining colours, which fall without this space, as they are\r\nmuch more dull and obscure than these, so will they be likewise much\r\nmore diffused; and therefore call hardly affect the sense in comparison\r\nof the other. And agreeable to this is the observation of astronomers,\r\nthat telescopes between twenty and sixty feet in length represent the\r\nfixed stars, as being about 5 or 6, at most about 8 or 10 seconds in\r\ndiameter. Whereas other arguments shew us, that they do not really\r\nappear to us of any sensible magnitude any otherwise than as their\r\nlight is dilated by refraction. One proof that the fixed stars do not\r\nappear to us under any sensible angle is, that when the moon passes\r\nover any of them, their light does not, like the planets on the same\r\noccasion, disappear by degrees, but vanishes at once.\r\n\r\n21. OUR author being thus convinced, that telescopes were not\r\ncapable of being brought to much greater perfection than at present\r\nby refractions, contrived one by reflection, in which there is no\r\nseparation made of the different coloured light; for in every kind of\r\nlight the rays after reflection have the same degree of inclination\r\nto the surface, from whence they are reflected, as they have at their\r\nincidence, so that those rays which come to the surface in one line,\r\nwill go off also in one line without any parting from one another.\r\nAccordingly in the attempt he succeeded so well, that a short one, not\r\nmuch exceeding six inches in length, equalled an ordinary telescope\r\nwhose length was four feet. Instruments of this kind to greater\r\nlengths, have of late been made, which fully answer expectation[331].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CHAP. V.~\r\n\r\nOf the RAINBOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nI SHALL now explain the rainbow. The manner of its production was\r\nunderstood, in the general, before Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ had discovered\r\nhis theory of colours; but what caused the diversity of colours in it\r\ncould not then be known, which obliges him to explain this appearance\r\nparticularly; whom we shall imitate as follows. The first person, who\r\nexpressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the\r\nsun-beams from drops of falling rain, was ANTONIO DE DOMINIS. But this\r\nwas afterwards more fully and distinctly explained by DESCARTES.\r\n\r\n2. THERE appears most frequently two rainbows; both of which are caused\r\nby the foresaid reflection of the sun-beams from the drops of falling\r\nrain, but are not produced by all the light which falls upon and are\r\nreflected from the drops. The inner bow is produced by those rays only\r\nwhich enter the drop, and at their entrance are so refracted as to\r\nunite into a point, as it were, upon the farther surface of the drop,\r\nas is represented in fig. 160; where the contiguous rays _a b_, _c d_,\r\n_e f_, coming from the sun, and therefore to sense parallel, upon\r\ntheir entrance into the drop in the points _b, d, f_, are so refracted\r\nas to meet together in the point _g_, upon the farther surface of\r\nthe drop. Now these rays being reflected nearly from the same point\r\nof the surface, the angle of incidence of each ray upon the point g\r\nbeing equal to the angle of reflection, the rays will return in the\r\nlines _g h, g k, g l_, in the same manner inclined to each other, as\r\nthey were before their incidence upon the point _g_, and will make\r\nthe same angles with the surface of the drop at the points _b, k,\r\nl_, as at the points _b, d, f_, after their entrance; and therefore\r\nafter their emergence out of the drop each ray will be inclined to the\r\nsurface in the same angle, as when it first entered it; whence the\r\nlines _b m, k n, l o_, in which the rays emerge, must be parallel to\r\neach other, as well as the lines _a b, c d, e f_, in which they were\r\nincident. But these emerging rays being parallel will not spread nor\r\ndiverge from each other in their passage from the drop, and therefore\r\nwill enter the eye conveniently situated in sufficient plenty to cause\r\na sensation. Whereas all the other rays, whether those nearer the\r\ncenter of the drop, as _p q, r s_, or those farther off, as _t u, w\r\nx_, will be reflected from other points in the hinder surface of the\r\ndrop; namely, the ray _p q_ from the point _y, r s_ from _z, t v_\r\nfrom α, and _w x_ from β. And for this reason by their reflection and\r\nsucceeding refraction they will be scattered after their emergence from\r\nthe forementioned rays and from each other, and therefore cannot enter\r\nthe eye placed to receive them copious enough to excite any distinct\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n3. THE external rainbow is formed by two reflections made between the\r\nincidence and emergence of the rays; for it is to be noted, that the\r\nrays _g h, g k, g l_, at the points _h, k, l_, do not wholly pass\r\nout of the drop, but are in part reflected back; though the second\r\nreflection of these particular rays does not form the outer bow. For\r\nthis bow is made by those rays, which after their entrance into the\r\ndrop are by the refraction of it united, before they arrive at the\r\nfarther surface, at such a distance from it, that when they fall\r\nupon that surface, they may be reflected in parallel lines, as is\r\nrepresented in fig. 161; where the rays _a b, c d, e f_, are collected\r\nby the refraction of the drop into the point _g_, and passing on from\r\nthence strike upon the surface of the drop in the points _h, k, l_, and\r\nare thence reflected to _m, n, o_, passing from _h_ to _m_, from _k_\r\nto _n_, and from _l_ to _o_ in parallel lines. For these rays after\r\nreflection at _m, n, o_, will meet again in the point _p_, at the same\r\ndistance from these points of reflection _m, n, o_, as the point _g_ is\r\nfrom the former points of reflection _h, k, l_. Therefore these rays\r\nin passing from _p_ to the surface of the drop will fall upon that\r\nsurface in the points _q, r, s_ in the same angles, as these rays made\r\nwith the surface in _b, d, f_, after refraction. Consequently, when\r\nthese rays emerge out of the drop into the air, each ray will make\r\nwith the surface of the drop the same angle, as it made at its first\r\nincidence; so that the lines _q t, r v, s w_, in which they come from\r\nthe drop, will be parallel to each other, as well as the lines _a b,\r\nc d, e f_, in which they came to the drop. By this means these rays\r\nto a spectator commodiously situated will become visible. But all the\r\nother rays, as well those nearer the center of the drop _x y_, _z_\r\nα, as those more remote from it β γ, δ ε, will be reflected in lines\r\nnot parallel to the lines _h m, k n, l o_; namely, the ray _x y_, in\r\nthe line ζ η, the ray ϰ α in the line θ ϰ, the ray β γ in the line\r\nλ μ, and the ray δ ε in the line ν χ. Whence these rays after their\r\nnext reflection and subsequent refraction will be scattered from the\r\nforementioned rays, and from one another, and by that means become\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\n4. IT is farther to be remarked, that if in the first case the incident\r\nrays _a b, c d, e f_, and their correspondent emergent rays _h m, k\r\nn, l o_, are produced till they meet, they will make with each other\r\na greater angle, than any other incident ray will make with its\r\ncorresponding emergent ray. And in the latter case, on the contrary,\r\nthe emergent rays _q t, r v, s w_ make with the incident rays an acuter\r\nangle, than is made by any other of the emergent rays.\r\n\r\n5. OUR author delivers a method of finding each of these extream angles\r\nfrom the degree of refraction being given; by which method it appears,\r\nthat the first of these angles is the less, and the latter the greater,\r\nby how much the refractive power of the drop, or the refrangibility of\r\nthe rays is greater. And this last consideration fully compleats the\r\ndoctrine of the rainbow, and shews, why the colours of each bow are\r\nranged in the order wherein they are seen.\r\n\r\n6. SUPPOSE A (in fig. 162.) to be the eye, B, C, D, E, F, drops of\r\nrain, M _n_, O _p_, Q _r_, S _t_, V _w_ parcels of rays of the sun,\r\nwhich entring the drops B, C, D, E, F after one reflection pass out to\r\nthe eye in A. Now let M _n_ be produced to η till it meets with the\r\nemergent ray likewise produced, let O _p_ produced meet its emergent\r\nray produced in ϰ, let Q _r_ meet its emergent ray in λ, let S _t_ meet\r\nits emergent ray in μ, and let V _w_ meet its emergent ray produced\r\nin ν. If the angle under M η A be that, which is derived from the\r\nrefraction of the violet-making rays by the method we have here spoken\r\nof, it follows that the violet light will only enter the eye from\r\nthe drop B, all the other coloured rays passing below it, that is,\r\nall those rays which are not scattered, but go out parallel so as to\r\ncause a sensation. For the angle, which these parallel emergent rays\r\nmakes with the incident in the most refrangible or violet-making rays,\r\nbeing less than this angle in any other sort of rays, none of the rays\r\nwhich emerge parallel, except the violet-making, will enter the eye\r\nunder the angle M η A, but the rest making with the incident ray M η\r\na greater angle than this will pass below the eye. In like manner if\r\nthe angle under O ϰ A agrees to the blue-making rays, the blue rays\r\nonly shall enter the eye from the drop C, and all the other coloured\r\nrays will pass by the eye, the violet-coloured rays passing above, the\r\nother colours below. Farther, the angle Q λ A corresponding to the\r\ngreen-making rays, those only shall enter the eye from the drop D, the\r\nviolet and blue-making rays passing above, and the other colours, that\r\nis the yellow and red, below. And if the angle S μ A answers to the\r\nrefraction of the yellow-making rays, they only shall come to the eye\r\nfrom the drop E. And in the last place, if the angle V ν A belongs to\r\nthe red-making and least refrangible rays, they only shall enter the\r\neye from the drop F, all the other coloured rays passing above.\r\n\r\n7. BUT now it is evident, that all the drops of water found in any of\r\nthe lines A ϰ, A λ, A μ, A ν, whether farther from the eye, or nearer\r\nthan the drops B, C, D, E, F, will give the same colours as these do,\r\nall the drops upon each line giving the same colour; so that the light\r\nreflected from a number of these drops will become copious enough to be\r\nvisible; whereas the reflection from one minute drop alone could not be\r\nperceived. But besides, it is farther manifest, that if the line A Ξ be\r\ndrawn from the sun through the eye, that is, parallel to the lines M\r\n_n_, O _p_, Q _r_, S _t_, V _w_, and if drops of water are placed all\r\nround this line, the same colour will be exhibited by all the drops at\r\nthe same distance from this line. Hence it follows, that when the sun\r\nis moderately elevated above the horizon, if it rains opposite to it,\r\nand the sun shines upon the drops as they fall, a spectator with his\r\nback turned to the sun must observe a coloured circular arch reaching\r\nto the horizon, being red without, next to that yellow, then green,\r\nblue, and on the inner edge violet; only this last colour appears faint\r\nby being diluted with the white light of the clouds, and from another\r\ncause to be mentioned hereafter[332].\r\n\r\n8. THUS is caused the interior or primary bow. The drops of rain at\r\nsome distance without this bow will cause the exterior or secondary\r\nbow by two reflections of the sun’s light. Let these drops be G, H, I,\r\nK, L; X _y_, Z α, Γ β, Δ ι, Θ ζ denoting parcels of rays which enter\r\neach drop. Now it has been remarked, that these rays make with the\r\nvisible refracted rays the greatest angle in those rays, which are\r\nmost refrangible. Suppose therefore the visible refracted rays, which\r\npass out from each drop after two reflections, and enter the eye in\r\nA, to intersect the incident rays in π, ρ, σ, τ, φ respectively. It\r\nis manifest, that the angle under Θ φ A is the greatest of all, next\r\nto that the angle under Δ τ A, the next in bigness will be the angle\r\nunder Γ σ A, the next to this the angle under Z ρ A, and the least of\r\nall the angle under X π A. From the drop L therefore will come to the\r\neye the violet-making, or most refrangible rays, from K the blue, from\r\nI the green, from H the yellow, and from G the red-making rays; and\r\nthe like will happen to all the drops in the lines A π, A ρ, A τ, A φ,\r\nand also to all the drops at the same distances from the line A Ξ all\r\nround that line. Whence appears the reason of the secondary bow, which\r\nis seen without the other, having its colours in a contrary order,\r\nviolet without and red within; though the colours are fainter than in\r\nthe other bow, as being made by two reflections, and two refractions;\r\nwhereas the other bow is made by two refractions, and one reflection\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n9. THERE is a farther appearance in the rainbow particularly described\r\nabout five years ago[333], which is, that under the upper part or\r\nthe inner bow there appears often two or three orders of very faint\r\ncolours, making alternate arches of green, and a reddish purple. At the\r\ntime this appearance was taken notice of, I gave my thoughts concerning\r\nthe cause of it[334], which I shall here repeat. Sir ~ISAAC NEWTON~ has\r\nobserved, that in glass, which is polished and quick-silvered, there is\r\nan irregular refraction made, whereby some small quantity of light is\r\nscattered from the principal reflected beam[335]. If we allow the same\r\nthing to happen in the reflection whereby the rainbow is caused, it\r\nseems sufficient to produce the appearance now mentioned.\r\n\r\n10. LET A B (in fig. 162.) represent a globule of water, B the point\r\nfrom whence the rays of any determinate species being reflected to C,\r\nand afterwards emerging in the line C D, would proceed to the eye, and\r\ncause the appearance of that colour in the rainbow, which appertains to\r\nthis species. Here suppose, that besides what is reflected regularly,\r\nsome small part of the light is irregularly scattered every way; so\r\nthat from the point B, besides the rays that are regularly reflected\r\nfrom B to C, some scattered rays will return in other lines, as\r\nin B E, B F, B G, B H, on each side the line B C. Now it has been\r\nobserved above[336], that the rays of light in their passage from one\r\nsuperficies of a refracting body to the other undergo alternate fits\r\nof easy transmission and reflection, succeeding each other at equal\r\nintervals; insomuch that if they reach the farther superficies in one\r\nsort of those fits, they shall be transmitted; if in the other kind\r\nof them, they shall rather be reflected back. Whence the rays that\r\nproceed from B to C, and emerge in the line C D, being in a fit of\r\neasy transmission, the scattered rays, that fall at a small distance\r\nwithout these on either side (suppose the rays that pass in the lines\r\nB E, B G) shall fall on the surface in a fit of easy reflection, and\r\nshall not emerge; but the scattered rays, that pass at some distance\r\nwithout these last, shall arrive at the surface of the globule in a fit\r\nof easy transmission, and break through that surface. Suppose these\r\nrays to pass in the lines B F, B H; the former of which rays shall have\r\nhad one fit more of easy transmission, and the latter one fit less,\r\nthan the rays that pass from B to C. Now both these rays, when they\r\ngo out of the globule, will proceed by the refraction of the water\r\nIn the lines F I, H K, that will be inclined almost equally to the\r\nrays incident on the globule, which come from the sun; but the angles\r\nof their inclination will be less than the angle, in which the rays\r\nemerging in the line C D are inclined to those incident rays. And after\r\nthe same manner rays scattered from the point B at a certain distance\r\nwithout these will emerge out of the globule, while the intermediate\r\nrays are intercepted; and these emergent rays will be inclined to the\r\nrays incident on the globule in angles still less than the angles, in\r\nwhich the rays F I and H K are inclined to them; and without these rays\r\nwill emerge other rays, that shall be inclined to the incident rays in\r\nangles yet less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow by this means may be formed of every kind of rays, besides the\r\nprincipal arch, which goes to the formation of the rainbow, other\r\narches within every one of the principal of the same colour, though\r\nmuch more faint; and this for divers successions, as long as these weak\r\nlights, which in every arch grow more and more obscure, shall continue\r\nvisible. Now as the arches produced by each colour will be variously\r\nmixed together, the diversity of colours observ’d in these secondary\r\narches may very possibly arise from them.\r\n\r\n11. IN the darker colours these arches may reach below the bow, and\r\nbe seen distinct. In the brighter colours these arches are lost in\r\nthe inferior part of the principal light of the rainbow; but in all\r\nprobability they contribute to the red tincture, which the purple of\r\nthe rainbow usually has, and is most remarkable when these secondary\r\ncolours appear strongest. However these secondary arches in the\r\nbrightest colours may possibly extend with a very faint light below the\r\nbow, and tinge the purple of these secondary arches with a reddish hue.\r\n\r\n12. THE precise distances between the principal arch and these fainter\r\narches depend on the magnitude of the drops, wherein they are formed.\r\nTo make them any degree separate it is necessary the drop be exceeding\r\nsmall. It is most likely, that they are formed in the vapour of the\r\ncloud, which the air being put in motion by the fall of the rain may\r\ncarry down along with the larger drops; and this may be the reason, why\r\nthese colours appear under the upper part of the bow only, this vapour\r\nnot descending very low. As a farther confirmation of this, these\r\ncolours are seen strongest, when the rain falls from very black clouds,\r\nwhich cause the fiercest rains, by the fall whereof the air will be\r\nmost agitated.\r\n\r\n13. TO the like alternate return of the fits of easy transmission and\r\nreflection in the passage of light through the globules of water, which\r\ncompose the clouds, Sir ISAAC NEWTON ascribes some of those coloured\r\ncircles, which at times appear about the sun and moon[337].\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ~ISAAC NEWTON~ having concluded each of his philosophical treatises\r\nwith some general reflections, I shall now take leave of my readers\r\nwith a short account of what he has there delivered. At the end of\r\nhis mathematical principles of natural philosophy he has given us his\r\nthoughts concerning the Deity. Wherein he first observes, that the\r\nsimilitude found in all parts of the universe makes it undoubted, that\r\nthe whole is governed by one supreme being, to whom the original is\r\nowing of the frame of nature, which evidently is the effect of choice\r\nand design. He then proceeds briefly to state the best metaphysical\r\nnotions concerning God. In short, we cannot conceive either of space\r\nor time otherwise than as necessarily existing; this Being therefore,\r\non whom all others depend, must certainly exist by the same necessity\r\nof nature. Consequently wherever space and time is found, there God\r\nmust also be. And as it appears impossible to us, that space should be\r\nlimited, or that time should have had a beginning, the Deity must be\r\nboth immense and eternal.\r\n\r\n2. AT the end of his treatise of optics he has proposed some thoughts\r\nconcerning other parts of nature, which he had not distinctly searched\r\ninto. He begins with some farther reflections concerning light, which\r\nhe had not fully examined. In particular he declares his sentiments at\r\nlarge concerning the power, whereby bodies and light act on each other.\r\nIn some parts of his book he had given short hints at his opinion\r\nconcerning this[338], but here he expressly declares his conjecture,\r\nwhich we have already mentioned[339], that this power is lodged in\r\na very subtle spirit of a great elastic force diffused thro’ the\r\nuniverse, producing not only this, but many other natural operations.\r\nHe thinks it not impossible, that the power of gravity itself should be\r\nowing to it. On this occasion he enumerates many natural appearances,\r\nthe chief of which are produced by chymical experiments. From numerous\r\nobservations of this kind he makes no doubt, that the smallest parts of\r\nmatter, when near contact, act strongly on each other, sometimes being\r\nmutually attracted, at other times repelled.\r\n\r\n3. THE attractive power is more manifest than the other, for\r\nthe parts of all bodies adhere by this principle. And the name of\r\nattraction, which our author has given to it, has been very freely\r\nmade use of by many writers, and as much objected to by others. He has\r\noften complained to me of having been misunderstood in this matter.\r\nWhat he lays upon this head was not intended by him as a philosophical\r\nexplanation of any appearances, but only to point out a power in nature\r\nnot hitherto distinctly observed, the cause of which, and the manner of\r\nits acting, he thought was worthy of a diligent enquiry. To acquiesce\r\nin the explanation of any appearance by asserting it to be a general\r\npower of attraction, is not to improve our knowledge in philosophy, but\r\nrather to put a stop to our farther search.\r\n\r\n                                FINIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Philosoph.
