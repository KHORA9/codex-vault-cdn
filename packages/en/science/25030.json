LIPPINCOTT & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of\r\n  Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nVariant spelling, dialect, and unusual punctuation have been retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAWANHAKA, THE ISLAND OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRECK OF THE CIRCASSIAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not by any means certain what was the name by which Long Island\r\nwas known to the aboriginal dwellers in its \"forest primeval,\" or indeed\r\nthat they ever had a common name by which to designate it. It seems\r\nprobable that each tribe bestowed upon it a different name, expressive\r\nof the aspect that appeared most striking to its primitive and poetical\r\nvisitors and occupants. Among so many tribes--the Canarsees (who met\r\nHudson when on September 4, 1609, he anchored in Gravesend Bay), the\r\nRockaways, Nyacks, Merrikokes, Matinecocs, Marsapeagues, Nissaquages,\r\nCorchaugs, Setaukets, Secataugs, Montauks, Shinecocs, Patchogues, and\r\nManhansetts, to say nothing of the Pequots and Narragansetts on the\r\nnorthern shore of the Sound--a community of usage in regard to\r\nnomenclature could hardly be expected. We accordingly find that one of\r\nthe old names of the island was Mattenwake, a compound of _Mattai_, the\r\nDelaware for \"island.\" It was also called Paumanacke (the Indian\r\noriginal of the prosaic Long Island), Mattanwake (the Narragansett word\r\nfor \"good\" or \"pleasant land\"), Pamunke and Meitowax. For a name,\r\nhowever, at once beautiful and suggestive, appropriate to an island\r\nwhose sunny shores are strewn with shells, and recalling Indian feuds\r\nand customs, savage ornament and tributes paid in wampum, no name equals\r\nthat we have chosen--Seawanhaka or Seawanhackee, the \"Island of Shells.\"\r\n\r\nNo general description will give an adequate idea of its changing beauty\r\nand wellnigh infinite variety. Its scenery assumes a thousand different\r\naspects between odoriferous Greenpoint and the solitary grandeur of\r\nMontauk. If one could only recall the old stagecoach, and, instead of\r\nwhirling in a few hours from New York to Sag Harbor, creep slowly along\r\nthe southern shore, and complete the journey of one hundred and ten\r\nmiles in two days and a half, as they did fifty years ago, a description\r\nof the route would be both easy and interesting. Then the old stage\r\nlumbered out of Brooklyn about nine o'clock in the morning, a halt was\r\nmade at Hempstead for dinner, and at Babylon the passengers slept.\r\nStarting early, they arrived in due time at Patchogue, where they\r\nbreakfasted late, and thereby saved their dinner, and at Quogue, about\r\ntwenty-four miles farther, they supped and slept. Again making an early\r\nstart without breakfast, they jogged along to Southampton, where the\r\nmorning meal was taken, and thus fortified they returned to their seats,\r\nand, passing through the beautiful country lying around Water Mill and\r\nBridgehampton, rattled into Sag Harbor--a far different place from the\r\nSag Harbor of to-day--and there dined. Fortunately, the rest of the\r\nroute remains to us, and we can still \"stage it\" down the old and\r\nbeautiful road to Easthampton. A leisurely journey of this description,\r\nat an average rate of a fraction less than two miles an hour, and with\r\nabundant opportunity of getting out for a brisk walk as the horses\r\ndragged their cumbrous load over an occasional sandhill, gave the\r\ntraveller a chance of seeing the country he passed through. Long Island\r\nlay before him like a book, every line of which he could read at\r\nleisure. He could wander along the shore of the bay at Babylon, and\r\nmayhap meditate upon the beauty of Nature while looking at the moonlight\r\nsleeping on the water: he could at Quogue seek his way across the\r\nmeadows and gaze upon the troubled face of the ocean. We can do so\r\nstill, but these pleasures are no longer to be counted among the\r\nfascinating interludes of continuous travel. They are not the\r\naccompaniments of a long journey that gave it a flavor of romance, and\r\nmade a trip to Sag Harbor and return the employment of an eventful and\r\ndelightful week.\r\n\r\nTo adapt ourselves to modern conditions, and as we must view Long Island\r\nin sections to appreciate it as a whole, a route may be chosen in which,\r\nby using both railroad and stage, we may see even more of it, and that\r\nto greater advantage, than the old-time traveller. It is necessary, in\r\nthe first place, that something should be seen of the northern shore. In\r\ncharacter and associations it differs widely from the southern. There\r\nis, in the second place, the central section, in avoiding which much of\r\nthe rural and most placid beauty of the island would be lost. There is,\r\nthirdly, the southern shore, varied in itself according as the point at\r\nwhich it is viewed lies on the ocean or on the landlocked bays between\r\nHempstead and Mecoc, and extending to the rugged headland of Montauk. We\r\nshall thus, by passing from point to point, see as in a panorama all\r\nthat need now attract our attention in viewing Seawanhaka.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORT JEFFERSON, FROM CEDAR HILL.]\r\n\r\nThe place which the Indians named Cumsewogue is now mainly distinguished\r\nby the cemetery of Cedar Hill. Passing among the graves, we reach the\r\nsummit, and a wonderful scene bursts upon our view. Looking north toward\r\nwhere the village is nestling in a hollow surrounded by woods, the\r\nwaters of Port Jefferson Bay are lying without a visible ripple; the\r\nsails of the ships passing up and down the Sound gleam in the sun; and\r\nbeyond them, like a hazy line, are the shores of Connecticut. On the\r\nleft are glimpses of farmhouses, the church-spires of Setauket, and\r\nrolling fields alternating with woods. On the right are more woods,\r\nbounded far away by the broken shore of the cliff-bound Sound. The\r\nwooded peninsula in front that stretches to the north, forming the\r\neastern shore of Port Jefferson Bay, was named by the old Puritan\r\nsettlers--for what reason it would be hard to divine--Mount Misery. It\r\nis now, fortunately, more generally known in the neighborhood by the\r\nname of the Strong estate of Oakwood. Sea, shore, woods and valleys make\r\nup a picturesque scene of peaceful beauty, and one forgets in the\r\npresence of its living charms that the site upon which he stands is\r\nwithin the limits of a city of the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABIN IN THE WOODS ABOVE POQUOTT.]\r\n\r\nWe descend into the village--which lies as if in a slumber that has\r\nlasted for a century and a half--at the head of the bay. The Indians\r\nnamed the place Souwassett, and the Puritans, in their usual\r\nmatter-of-fact manner, called it Drowned Meadow. Its present name was\r\nadopted about forty years ago, probably in a patriotic mood, and also in\r\nthe belief that the name it then bore was too unqualified and likely to\r\ngive rise to unwarrantable prejudices. That there was some truth, if\r\nthere was neither beauty nor imagination, in the name, is, however,\r\nevident from the marsh-lands lying between the village and Dyer's Neck\r\nor Poquott, which divides the harbor from that of Setauket on the west.\r\nOne of the old landmarks of the village, dating from about the first\r\nquarter of the last century, is the house built by the Roe family when\r\nthe settlement was first made. It now forms part of the Townsend house,\r\nand is still occupied by collateral descendants of its builder.\r\nAccessions to the little colony came slowly. Even the fine harbor could\r\nnot compensate for the disadvantages of Drowned Meadow for building\r\npurposes, and the hillsides are steep and rocky. But about 1797, when it\r\nis said there were only half a dozen houses in the village, shipbuilding\r\nwas begun, and its subsequent rise was comparatively rapid.\r\n\r\nSecurely though it seems to repose among its wood-crowned hills, it has\r\nhad at least one exciting episode in its history. During the war of 1812\r\nits shipping suffered considerably at the hands of King George's\r\ncruisers, and one night the enemy entered the harbor and captured seven\r\nsloops that were lying there at anchor. Otherwise, life at Port\r\nJefferson appears to have been as it is now, unexciting and peaceful.\r\nIts attractions are in part those of association, but chiefly those of\r\nNature--its sandy shore, its still woods and its placid bay. It is a\r\nplace to fly to when the only conception of immediate happiness is to be\r\nstill, to float idly upon water that has no waves to detract from the\r\nperfection of a dream of absolute rest, or to seek shelter and eloquent\r\nquiet in deep and shady woods. There are several winding paths that lead\r\nup the hilly promontory of Oakwood, and there are clearings upon the\r\nhigh ground swept over by breezes from the Sound where one can look upon\r\nrural scenes as perfect in their way as imagination can picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE RONKONKOMA.]\r\n\r\nTo the west of the village, pathways lead through the woods and past\r\nmany ruined and ruinous cabins. The latter are chiefly occupied by\r\nnegroes, who enjoy the sweets of liberty in these sequestered nooks. It\r\nis questionable if emancipation in any way bettered their condition. The\r\nDutch introduced slaves into Long Island immediately upon settling on\r\nits western extremity, but it is said upon good authority--and the fact\r\nis a notable one in the history of the island--that slavery never\r\nexisted there except in name. The work of the farms and houses was\r\ndivided with the utmost impartiality among the nominal slaves and the\r\nwhite men and boys of the household. Possibly, then, there is not only\r\nno dark background to the lives of these Port Jefferson negroes, but one\r\nthat in comfort and happiness is a contrast to the present. One little\r\nfellow--a darkling he should be called--peeped out shyly as we passed,\r\nand then disappeared in a hut which, though embowered in creeping plants\r\nand bushes, did not suggest either comfort or beauty when the trees are\r\nbare and the winds of winter are moaning through the woods. Beyond these\r\ncabins the path leads to the pebbly and shell-covered shore of Poquott.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Port Jefferson the shore runs in bolder outline to Orient\r\nPoint, but within thirty or forty miles to the west there are\r\ninnumerable points and well-sheltered bays and inlets that give the\r\nscenery the same picturesque character that is found at Port Jefferson.\r\nIt may be taken, in short, as representing the northern side of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWhen the shore is left a few miles behind the country assumes an\r\nentirely different aspect. The roads run through a wide tract covered as\r\nfar as the eye can see with young timber and brushwood. In places the\r\ncharred trunks give evidence that it has at no distant period been\r\npassed over by a forest-fire. The view to the south is bounded by the\r\nlow range of hills that runs nearly the entire length of the island. In\r\na hollow in this rising ground, a few miles east of Comac Hills, about\r\ntwo miles north-east of Mount Pleasant and near the eastern continuation\r\nof the Comac range, we drop suddenly upon the most charming of the lakes\r\nof Long Island--Ronkonkoma. It matters little from which side it is\r\napproached or from what point it is viewed--Lake Ronkonkoma is in every\r\nway and in every aspect beautiful. Around it on all sides is an\r\nundulating country comprising both woodland and farm, and dotted with\r\nquaint old houses of the many-gabled order, and a few that affect a\r\ncertain latter-day primness. The architectural patriarchs and juveniles\r\nrepresent two different orders of things. The first tell of the early\r\ncolonists of two hundred years ago making their way through the dense\r\nwoods from the northern shore, and choosing dwellings by the lake where\r\nthe land was good. The latter tell of later settlers, attracted solely\r\nby the beauty and salubrity of the place. There is one house still\r\nstanding on the east side of the lake, a weather-beaten veteran of a\r\ncentury and a half. It has been in the same family ever since it was\r\nbuilt, and if its walls were as eloquent of facts as they are of\r\nsentiment, it could no doubt unfold a varied tale. The place has, of\r\ncourse, a history based upon Indian times. Where we now see boats and\r\nskiffs, canoes were once paddled, and the lonely seclusion of the lake\r\nis said to have made it the theme of many an Indian story. Only one\r\nlegend now survives. The lake has always been, and is now, well stocked\r\nwith fish, and it is in places so deep that the Indians thought it\r\nunfathomable. With a curious kind of veneration they believed that the\r\nGreat Spirit brought the fish that swarm in its waters, and kept them\r\nunder his special care. Even when the whites came upon the scene the red\r\nmen clung to their superstition, and would not catch nor eat the fish,\r\nbelieving them to be superior beings.\r\n\r\nA change has come over the spot since that day. The land near the lake\r\nhas been partially cleared, but not to such an extent as to divest it of\r\nany of its early beauty. A fringe of trees encloses it on all sides\r\nexcept the north, where a narrow belt of sand divides it from a lily\r\npond. It is from that feature, and from the glistening western shore,\r\nthat the lake was called Ronkonkoma (Sand Pond). At the point where it\r\nfirst bursts upon the traveller from the south it is seen gleaming\r\nthrough the trees like a diamond in a robe of green. Standing upon its\r\nmargin, we are about fifty feet above the sea, and the cool wind that is\r\nrustling among the trees comes fresh from the Great South Bay, seven\r\nmiles away. To right and left are high tree-covered banks, and to the\r\nnorth across the lake, about a mile off, the white sand is shining like\r\na line of silver. The trees above the eastern shore are reflected as in\r\na mirror, and the little boat with its snowy sail is there in duplicate,\r\nitself and double.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEACH AT FIRE ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nBut, to be seen at its best, Ronkonkoma should be viewed from one of the\r\nhigher points along its eastern shore when the sun is sloping down the\r\nwestern sky. One memorable evening this view was so beautiful as to be\r\nalmost unearthly. The sun had sunk behind a heavy cloud-bank, which it\r\ntipped with a dull tawny red. By and by the sky began to change. The\r\ncloud sank lower, and lay upon the horizon in a perfectly black mass\r\nthat threw its shadow upon the landscape. Its lining had deepened in\r\ncolor to a blood-red, and the clouds higher up the arch of the sky were\r\nringed with a rich crimson border. Higher still they shaded off into\r\npaler tints, mingled with a copper-like hue that merged in the lighter\r\nclouds into gold. Above these were fleecy, rounded fragments of cloud\r\nfloating over the deep blue like burnished brass upon lapis lazuli; and\r\nhigher yet, about midway to the zenith, every cloudlet was tinged with\r\npale yellow. Could such a sky be represented on canvas it would be\r\ncondemned as unnatural--a case of the painter's imagination carrying him\r\nbeyond the limits of true art. But it was from the reflection in the\r\nlake that the scene derived its weird, supernatural character. The\r\nshadows lay heavily upon the trees and bank that line the western shore.\r\nUpon the edge of the waters, which were so still that not a ripple waved\r\nthe line drawn upon the white streak of sand, the deep red of the cloud\r\nupon the horizon reappeared. Nearer were the graduated tints of crimson,\r\ncopper, gold, brass and pale yellow, every hue mirrored in the crystal\r\nlake with a fidelity so perfect that one was in doubt whether the\r\nreality or the reflection were the more gorgeous.\r\n\r\nTo the east and west of the lake, for twenty miles on either side of it,\r\nstretches a pleasant tract, chiefly of rolling woodland, with here and\r\nthere a farm or garden. Wherever the land has been cleared and brought\r\nunder cultivation it appears to give ample return to the husbandman. But\r\nthe least observant traveller can hardly help being struck by the sight\r\nof a few fields of apparently healthy grain surrounded by miles of\r\nbrushwood. It is a mystery not yet satisfactorily solved how within\r\nfifty miles of a city like New York so much land should be left\r\nunproductive and untilled. All the evidence, both of experiment and of\r\nopinion, goes to show that the soil, if not the richest in the world, is\r\nfar too good to be given over to scrubby bushes and luxuriant weeds.\r\n\r\nLeaving, however, a question so abstruse, let us turn southward from\r\nYaphank and follow the brook that runs down past Carman's until it\r\nempties itself in Fireplace Bay. Again the scenery undergoes a change.\r\nHere is neither the broken, picturesque shore of the north nor the\r\ninland quietude of Ronkonkoma. Toward the west, beyond our ken,\r\nstretches the Great South Bay, far past where the lighthouse of Fire\r\nIsland can be seen flashing out upon the night. To the south, about\r\nthree miles distant, are the undulating dunes of the Great South Beach,\r\nthat like a huge breakwater shuts out the ocean. To the east is the\r\nbroad promontory lying behind Mastic Point. This is practically the same\r\nview upon which we have imagined the traveller by the old-time stage\r\nfeasting his eyes at the halting-places along the southern shore. At any\r\npoint between Babylon and the place at which we stand the scenery has\r\nthe same general character--a picturesque pleasantness devoid of\r\ndisturbing grandeur. However loudly the ocean may thunder upon the outer\r\nshore, the bay seldom changes its dimpling smiles for a rougher aspect,\r\nand never wears in wrath the scornful look of the outer deep. A strong\r\nwind may sometimes give a little trouble to the yachtsmen whose craft\r\nenliven the scene, and lead them to reef their swelling canvas, but the\r\nimpression carried away from the Great South Bay is decidedly summery--a\r\nmemory of mingled sunshine and gentle breezes. The shore is generally\r\nflat, and is lined with a succession of villages located at intervals of\r\nfrom three to four miles. They are all more or less alike--quiet,\r\nhealthy places, in which, to all appearances, the inhabitants take life\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles to the west is Blue Point, of oyster fame, in\r\nconnection with which a curious tradition is extant. It is said that\r\nlong ago the oysters disappeared entirely from the bay. The poor people\r\nfrom all the country round were in the habit of raking up the oysters\r\nfor their own consumption and for sale. In an evil hour the authorities\r\nof the town of Brookhaven, to which the beds belong, resolved upon\r\nreplenishing the town treasury by the imposition of a license upon the\r\npoor fishermen. The latter, either unable to meet the demands of the law\r\nor bent upon maintaining what appeared to them a natural right, made a\r\ncounter-resolve upon resistance to its enforcement. The result was a\r\ncollision, and by dint of armed men and boats the unlicensed fishermen\r\nwere driven off. Thereafter, curious to relate, not another oyster was\r\ntaken, and nothing but empty shells filled the unblessed rakes. This\r\nstate of things lasted until about forty years ago, when it is presumed\r\nthe grip of the law was relaxed. The poor people, at all events, then\r\nagain had recourse to the long-deserted beds, and found them covered to\r\nthe depth of several feet with luscious young oysters.\r\n\r\nA number of boats ply between Bellport and the Great South Beach,\r\nwhither the summer visitors are in the habit of repairing for the\r\npurpose of tumbling in the surf on the outside. In one of these, with a\r\nfair wind and a skipper acquainted with the numerous shoals, it is very\r\npleasant to sail across the bay, and then turning round Mastic Point to\r\nfollow the channel connecting the Great South with East Bay, and so to\r\nreach Moriches. From that point east the shore is broken up into shallow\r\ncreeks until Quogue (from _quohaug_, a clam), an old resort of the\r\ncitizens of Philadelphia, New York and other cities, is reached. It\r\noccupies the neck of land dividing Shinecoc from East Bay, and is the\r\nfirst place after leaving Rockaway, about sixty miles to the west, which\r\nhas direct communication with the shore of the ocean. The beach there\r\ntouches the mainland, and then leaves it again to make room for Shinecoc\r\nBay. At the most northerly arm of the latter we come upon a place with a\r\npeculiar history and corresponding associations, and there on the\r\nadjacent hills of Shinecoc we may pause for a few moments' observation.\r\nWe are now in the township of Southampton, where, with the exception of\r\nLion Gardiner's settlement upon the island still bearing his name, the\r\nfirst English settlement in the State of New York was effected.\r\n\r\nToward both east and west the country stretches away as far as we can\r\nsee in undulating woods and fields. Had we come by land instead of the\r\nbays, we should have passed through a series of four or five little\r\nvillages, Moriches, Speonk, Good Ground and West Hampton, cozily\r\nnestling among the woods--quiet, retired places, given over to peace and\r\nagriculture. There is no particularly prominent feature in the\r\nlandscape. Its charm lies in its harmony, and the _ensemble_ is as\r\nnearly perfect as can be imagined. Immediately in front are the knolls\r\nand dales above and below Good Ground, and extending down to where the\r\nPonquogue lighthouse stands out in clear outline against the sky. To the\r\nsouth is Shinecoc Bay, and to the north is Peconic Bay, the water that\r\nlies between the forks at the eastern end of Long Island. Below us,\r\nlooking west, is Canoe Place, the name given to the narrow neck of land\r\njoining the peninsula that terminates at Montauk to the body of the\r\nisland. It is the point at which the waters on the north and south come\r\nmost nearly together, and there, accordingly, as the name implies, was\r\nthe Indian portage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PECONIC BAY, AND RESIDENCE OF CHIEF-JUSTICE DALY.]\r\n\r\nToward the east, across the rising and falling ground and beyond the\r\nwoods, lies the village of Southampton, where the first settlement in\r\nthe township was formed. The colonists were chiefly Englishmen, who,\r\nhaving resided for a short time in Lynn, Massachusetts, turned their\r\neyes toward such \"pastures new\" as Long Island afforded. They first\r\ntried to locate themselves in the north-western part of the island, but\r\nhaving been driven out by the Dutch, their second venture led them to\r\nNorth Sea, and thence through the woods to Southampton. They found the\r\nland both good and cheap. All that the Indians asked for the district\r\nlying between Canoe Place and the eastern limit of the township at Sag\r\nHarbor was sixteen coats, threescore bushels of Indian corn and a\r\npromise of protection against hostile tribes. Forty-three years\r\nafterward the official estimate of the township amounted to about eighty\r\nthousand dollars, so that the men of Lynn undoubtedly received good\r\nvalue for their coats and corn.\r\n\r\nTheir choice of a home is sufficient to place their good judgment above\r\nquestion. There are still existing in the village a few mementos of\r\ntheir presence in the form of weather-stained houses, over which have\r\npassed, leaving them untouched, all the vicissitudes of Indian times,\r\nthe Revolutionary War and modern improvement. Time, however, has left\r\nits scars upon their fronts. The street leading down toward the shore of\r\nthe ocean is grass-grown and spacious, and probably differs very little\r\nfrom what it was in the olden time. On the left side stands the\r\nPelletreau house, where Lord Erskine resided during the winter of 1778.\r\nOn the floor in one of the rooms are certain marks, said to have been\r\nmade by the axe of the British quartermaster. Others of the old\r\nbuildings have recently been removed, but those that are left are\r\nsufficient to recall the time when, plundered alike by friend and foe,\r\nand compelled to maintain its enemy, Southampton yet patriotically\r\ncontributed its quota of men to the war for independence. There is\r\nnothing of the upstart about the place. It reposes in a quiet, dignified\r\npresent resting upon a long and honorable past, and there is in its\r\nattitude and air something that compels one to revert to the latter. Its\r\npopulation partakes of the same character. Although some of the first\r\nsettlers removed to other places or returned to Lynn, most of the old\r\nfamilies took deep root in the soil, and are represented by descendants\r\nwho live within sight of the primitive dwellings their forefathers\r\nreared. Offshoots were, however, thrown off in many directions. Some\r\nwent down to Cape May, whither the whale-fishing attracted them; others\r\nwere among the pioneers of the West, and founded colonies at various\r\nplaces in New York State and in Pennsylvania; others took their places\r\namong the Argonauts of '49 and sought the gold-fields of California. But\r\nstill the parent trees stood fast in Southampton.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of whales off the coast, though now a rare occurrence,\r\nwas not so in the early days of the town. Among the earliest of its\r\nrecords is a law providing for the cutting up and division of any whales\r\nthat might be cast up on the shore. At a later day boats were fitted up\r\neither to put off in pursuit when a whale was signalled or to cruise\r\nalong the coast in the whaling season. In the former case, by a usage\r\nwhich extended to the adjoining township of Easthampton, signals were\r\nhoisted at fixed stations along the shore, whereupon the boats were\r\ndragged down the beach and launched through the surf, while the\r\nventuresome crew leaped in, each man taking his own place. How dangerous\r\nsuch a pursuit was can be estimated by any one who will walk to the high\r\nridge of sand running along the beach and look eastward down the long\r\nline of breakers that toss their foam-capped heads before a heavy gale.\r\nFor many miles nothing can be seen but the arching waves dashing\r\nthemselves upon the sand, as if furious that their course should be\r\nchecked. The whale has almost entirely deserted its old haunt, but the\r\nsea still furnishes many an exciting, and also many a sad, episode in\r\nthe otherwise uneventful lives of the townsmen. Not a winter passes\r\nwithout some ship or ocean steamer being thrown upon Hampton shore, and\r\noften, in spite of the gallantry and exertions of the lifeboatmen, whose\r\nstations stand at intervals of five miles, the crews never reach the\r\nland until flung up lifeless by the waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAG HARBOR.]\r\n\r\nMaintaining still an eastward course, we pass Water Mill, lying upon one\r\nof the inlets of Mecoc Bay, and hurrying through Bridgehampton arrive at\r\nSag Harbor, the chief port of the peninsula. It is a quiet, interesting\r\ntown, beautifully situated on a branch of Gardiner's Bay. Across the\r\nneck that projects over toward Shelter Island on the north, and beyond\r\nthe site chosen by Chief-Justice Daly for his residence, lies Peconic\r\nBay. Toward the east stretches the bay, past the lower end of Shelter\r\nIsland, past Cedar Point, and then away off to where Gardiner's Island\r\nis stretching its long arms to the north and south, as if to guard the\r\ngreat haven inside from the ocean storms. A century and a half ago\r\nnothing stood upon the spot where the town now stands but a few\r\nfishermen's huts. In a short time the settlers were engaged in\r\nwhale-fishing off the coast, and thereby really laid the foundations of\r\nSag Harbor's future prosperity and wealth. In 1760 three sloops were\r\nfitted out to prosecute the fishing in the northern seas, and after the\r\nwar of independence Dr. N. Gardiner and his brother despatched on the\r\nsame errand the first ship that ever sailed from Sag Harbor. The venture\r\nfailed, but others succeeded, and in 1847 sixty-three ships were engaged\r\nin the business. After that date the decline was fast, and now not a\r\nsingle ship of the whole fleet is left. Captain Babcock, the\r\nlighthouse-keeper of Montauk, sailed six or seven years ago the brig\r\nMyra, the last whaler that left Sag Harbor. His success was not so great\r\nthat the owners, the Messrs. French, cared to repeat the experiment; so\r\nthat within twenty years Sag Harbor has fallen from its position as the\r\nthird or fourth whaling-port in the country to that in which we find it\r\nto-day. The gold fever of '49, the discovery of petroleum and the\r\nincreased expense attending the whale-fishing, all contributed to its\r\ndecline. It is also claimed for Sag Harbor that Captain Cooper of the\r\nManhattan, sailing from that port, was the first to take a ship into\r\nYeddo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR EASTHAMPTON.]\r\n\r\nIn and around the town are many evidences of the generally well-to-do\r\ncondition of its inhabitants, amongst whom are several whose rise to\r\ngreater wealth was checked by the fall of the whale-fishing. In their\r\nhomes and those of retired merchant captains are many mementos of long\r\nvoyages to China, Japan, the Indies, and, in short, to every part of the\r\nworld. It is singular how interesting, as compared with the choicest\r\nthings to be found in the shops, these porcelains, lacquers, enamels,\r\nivories, fans, silks, weapons and cabinets are. They are the trophies of\r\nthe Ancient Mariner, who takes some pride in turning over the contents\r\nof his shelves, and derive a personal interest from having been with him\r\nthrough the storms he weathered before he brought them safe to port.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HOME, SWEET HOME!\"--PAYNE'S INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nEvery part of the town is interesting, and certainly not the least so is\r\nthe old cemetery. It contains an extensive collection of rude headstones\r\nand quaint epitaphs. Here, on a sailor's grave, are engraved the lines--\r\n\r\n          Rude Boreas' winds and Neptune's waves\r\n            Have tossed me to and fro:\r\n          By God's decree, you plainly see,\r\n            I'm harbored here below.\r\n\r\nIn Sag Harbor there lived a certain Captain David Hand, who died in 1840\r\nat the age of eighty-one. Here he and his five wives are sleeping, all\r\nin a row. The first died in 1791; the second, in 1794; the third, in\r\n1798; the fourth, in 1810; the fifth, in 1835. The gallant captain\r\nhimself went down while cruising in quest of a sixth. It is upon the\r\ngrave of the third that the following appears:\r\n\r\n          Behold, ye living mortals passing by,\r\n          How thick the partners of one husband lie.\r\n          Vast and unsearchable the ways of God:\r\n          Just, but severe, we feel His chastening rod.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is a little obscure, and it is only the subsequent\r\nmatrimonial ventures of the captain that assure us he did not mean that\r\nthe three who had gone were to him as a chastening rod.\r\n\r\nLet us now take our station where we can look down upon the town and\r\nover the surrounding scene of mingled island, sea and shore, and try to\r\nrecall some of the thrilling events that give Sag Harbor its historical\r\ninterest. Two hundred and fifty years ago these bays, now alive with\r\ncoasting vessels, pleasure craft and an occasional steamer, showed\r\nnothing but the canoes of the Manhansetts and Montauketts. In 1637 we\r\nmight have seen the large canoe of Wyandanch, the sachem of the\r\nMontauks, surrounded by those of his tribe, stealing across toward\r\nShelter Island to complete the extermination of the Pequots. In 1699 the\r\nship in which Kidd won his plunder in the southern seas was lying under\r\nthe island's lee while the famous pirate was burying a part of his booty\r\non its shore. It is said that the proprietor of the island has still in\r\nhis possession a piece of gold cloth given to his ancestor by Captain\r\nKidd. Soon afterward Gardiner's Island was visited and plundered by\r\nPaul Williams and some of his buccaneering associates. In 1728 these\r\nseas swarmed with the pirates of Spain, and one night in September of\r\nthat year the crew of a schooner landed upon Gardiner's Island, and for\r\nthree days it was given up to plunder. The next we see is a British\r\nfleet in 1775 sweeping round the arm of the island and coming to anchor\r\nin the bay, whence, like the pirates, they sent out parties to plunder\r\nMr. Gardiner's house and farm. Sag Harbor was occupied by British\r\ntroops, and one evening in 1777 across Peconic Bay from Southold the\r\nboat that carried Lieutenant-Colonel Meigs and his patriot companions\r\nwas sailing. Landing a few miles to the west of the town, they fell upon\r\nthe British garrison like a midnight thunderbolt. The commander was\r\nseized in bed, the shipping and provisions were fired, and Meigs and his\r\nmen had finished their work and retired before the British soldiers were\r\nfully awake. Again, in 1780-81, the British fleet anchored in the bay,\r\nand yet again in 1813. In the latter year Commodore Hardy sent a launch\r\nand two barges with a hundred men to plunder Sag Harbor, but the project\r\nutterly failed. The town was roused, the guns of the fort opened upon\r\nthe intruders, and then the villagers returned to their slumbers. When\r\npeace was restored the bay was ploughed by West Indiamen and whalers,\r\nand then, as we have seen, they also vanished. Apart, then, from the\r\nbeauty of its situation, Sag Harbor has associations and a history that\r\nform appreciable items in the list of its attractions; and if its future\r\nshould be less glowing than its past, it will not be for lack of a\r\nhealthy and mild climate nor of exceptional advantages of location.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHERMAN'S HOUSE NEAR HAMPTON BEACH.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the town in quest of Easthampton Village we find\r\nourselves in the township of that name. All these woods and fair fields\r\nstretching from the Southampton limit eastward to Montauk, and\r\ncomprising upward of thirty thousand acres, were in 1648 bought for \"20\r\ncoats, 24 hoes, 24 hatchets, 24 knives, 24 looking-glasses and 100\r\nmuxes.\" Most of the settlers in the village we are now approaching came\r\nfrom Kent, and memories of their English home led them to give it the\r\nname of Maidstone, which was afterward changed to Easthampton. It lies\r\nin the midst of a beautiful section of country, full of pretty little\r\npictures of rustic life. The main street is, like that of Southampton, a\r\nbroad grass-grown avenue lined with stately trees, and as we go down in\r\nthe direction of the shore we pass a spot interesting to\r\nEnglish-speaking people all over the world--the birthplace of John\r\nHoward Payne, the author of \"Home, Sweet Home.\" It is with a feeling\r\napproaching reverence that we look at the old open fireplace, the\r\nrafters and walls; and as we emerge and glance up and down the spacious\r\nstreet, and drink in the placid beauty of the scene, the fountain of the\r\npoet's inspiration is revealed. Once seen, it is a place for every man\r\nto remember all through life, even if \"he owed it not his birth.\" And\r\nhere the thought recurs that there must be an unusually strong tie\r\nbetween the villagers in all the Hamptons and their homes. The names of\r\nmany of the old settlers are still met with throughout the entire\r\nsection from Southampton eastward, so that while Payne was giving\r\nexpression to a sentiment that is universal in language that the world\r\nat large has adopted, his words have also a particular significance in\r\ntelling us of the atmosphere of sentiment peculiar in its warmth and\r\nmanifestation to the district in which he was reared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING SYLVESTER.]\r\n\r\nOur path now lies eastward through the straggling little village of\r\nAmagansett, and through the woods beyond which lie Neapeague and\r\nMontauk, the \"Hilly Land.\" The quiet repose of village-life is now left\r\nbehind, and through rapidly-changing scenes we set our faces toward the\r\ngrandest and most wonderful section of Long Island. For about two miles\r\nafter leaving Amagansett our route lies through thick woods of young\r\ntimber, and then we suddenly emerge at a point where the road turns\r\nround a spur of the high land we have just passed. On the south is the\r\nocean, in sight of which the road thereafter runs the greater part of\r\nthe way to the point, and in front, stretching for six or seven miles\r\nuntil it joins the hills of Montauk, is the marshy beach of Neapeague,\r\nthe \"Water Land.\" As we descend, the sea is hidden by the irregular\r\ndunes that lie along the shore, and the dreary expanse extends far\r\nbefore us and off toward the north. Every step leads us to realize more\r\nfully the dismal character of the sterile flat. The wagon-wheels\r\nalternately grind through the sand and bump into deep puddles in the\r\nmarsh. There can be no doubt that once this whole tract was overflowed\r\nby the sea, and still in heavy storms the waves force their way between\r\nthe sandhills and lay parts of the beach under water. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, attention is likely to be diverted from the consideration of\r\nthe inroads of the sea to the incessant attacks of the insatiate and\r\nbloodthirsty mosquitoes. We are here in their very home, and, galled by\r\ntheir furious stinging onslaughts, can recall nothing but Ayres's\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n          Cheerless Neapeague! how bounds the heart to gain\r\n          The hills that spring beyond thy weary plain!\r\n\r\nThe busy, bloodthirsty wretches spring in clouds from every swamp. They\r\nfill the air, obscure the blue lining of the wagon with their own tawny\r\ngray, and would, I verily believe, turn a white horse brown. But the end\r\ncomes at length, and as we climb the hill bounding the beach on the east\r\nthe last of the little tormentors disappears. To our left are the\r\nNommonock Hills, and those of Hither Wood rise in front of us. At the\r\npoint now reached it is well to turn round and view the land we have\r\npassed. We can look across from shore to shore, from the ocean breakers\r\non the south to the little harbor of Neapeague on the north, and beyond\r\nit to where Gardiner's Island lies out in the bay. The conviction grows\r\nupon us that where we now stand was once an island, and that the rugged\r\nbase of Nommonock was once washed by the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING DAVID FARO AND FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nSoon we pass through the Hither Woods, and with them leave behind the\r\nlast remnant of the forest that formerly covered Montauk. All else, to\r\nwhere Womponomon--the Indian name of the eastern point--juts out into\r\nthe sea, are hills and rolling downs which rise and fall like the sea\r\nwhen the waves are running \"mountains high.\" Here and there we pass a\r\npond, and often startle the cattle that graze over the greater part of\r\nMontauk; and at length pause, spellbound by the view from the hills\r\nlooking down upon Fort Pond, or Kongonock. The road runs past its\r\nsouthern extremity, where, until the embankment was built, the\r\nocean-surf frequently broke across; and after passing this plain, called\r\nFithian's, we find ourselves a very short distance south of the site of\r\nthe old Indian village. The hill about halfway between the two ends of\r\nthe pond on its eastern side was once occupied by an Indian fort, and\r\nbetween it and us lies the valley where were clustered the wigwams of\r\nWyandanch and his tribe. He figures in history as the staunch and often\r\nseverely-tried ally of the whites, and was the lifelong friend of Lion\r\nGardiner. His warriors were, hyperbolically, \"as many as the spires of\r\nthe grass\" until reduced by sickness and battle. The Narragansetts\r\npursued him with an insatiate and vindictive hate, and this peaceful\r\nvalley was once the scene of a bloody tragedy from which the Montauketts\r\nnever recovered. Wyandanch had pursued a party of Narragansetts to Block\r\nIsland, and killed a great number of them. To retaliate, Ninicraft (or\r\nNinigret) invaded Montauk, and on the night of the nuptials of the\r\nchief's daughter fell upon the village, burned, sacked and slew, and, in\r\nspite of Wyandanch's bravery, totally defeated his followers. Among the\r\nfallen was the bridegroom, and beside his dead body the invaders found\r\nthe bride in a stupor of grief. She was hurried away, an unresisting\r\ncaptive, but was ultimately restored to her father by the exertions of\r\nLion Gardiner. In 1659, Wyandanch died from the effects of poison, and\r\nwith him went out the glory of his tribe. Piece after piece, the lands\r\nhe had held were ceded to the whites, and the royal line of Faro came to\r\nan end. In 1819 \"King\" Stephen died, and was buried by subscription. His\r\ndistinctive badge consisted of a yellow ribbon round his hat. After him\r\nothers reigned, and although the royal family long ago became extinct,\r\nthe name of king or chief is still retained. The late holder of the\r\ntitle was David Faro, and he reigned over two families, his own and the\r\nFowlers. He will probably be succeeded by his cousin Stephen, an\r\nathletic gentleman and a full-blooded Indian, who is said to have walked\r\nin one day from Brooklyn to Montauk, and who thinks little of stepping\r\nfrom Montauk to Bridgehampton, thence to Sag Harbor for dinner, and so\r\non back to Montauk. The late chief left a widow and five children. The\r\neldest is a boy named Wyandanch, who occasionally visits the few houses\r\non the peninsula and the nearest villages, selling berries. The queen's\r\nmother and the rest of the tribe are basket-makers. The second of\r\nDavid's children is Maggie Arabella, a pleasant-faced girl with\r\nthick-set figure; the third and fourth are bright-eyed boys, Samuel\r\nPowhattan and Ebenezer Tecumseh; and the fifth is a child of about six\r\nmonths, Sarah Pocahontas. Besides these there are the present king,\r\nStephen, and his son Samuel. King Sylvester preceded David, so that we\r\nare in possession of the likenesses of three of the line of sachems.\r\nEphraim Fowler, a son of Sylvester, also survives. Of the other family\r\nof Fowlers, there are the husband and wife and their four children,\r\nthree sons and a daughter. Such, so far as I know, is a complete census\r\nof the tribe of Montauketts. Their possessions are small and their way\r\nof living rude. Ichabod! Ichabod!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEPHEN, KING _IN POSSE_.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the hill overlooking Fort Pond, we are almost due south of\r\nPoint Culloden. When Montauk throws off entirely its old character and\r\nfully assumes the inevitable new, the bay to the west of Culloden will\r\nprobably be converted by a breakwater into a harbor, and to the north of\r\nwhere we stand it is not unlikely that the snort of the locomotive may\r\nyet be heard. Already there are rumors of impending change. With the\r\nrailroad brought through from Sag Harbor, Fort Pond Bay will be the\r\npoint of arrival and departure of steamers plying between the island and\r\nthe New England shore. It is even suggested that the Transatlantic\r\nsteamers might make it a stopping-place to land mails and passengers.\r\nThe bay is so deep that vessels of any tonnage could enter it, and it\r\nwould moreover prove an excellent refuge in stormy weather. When thus\r\nbrought into more speedy communication with the western part of the\r\nisland, the lonely grandeur of Montauk will be modified by the inroads\r\nof traffic and the things that tell of the far-distant city and its\r\nseething mass of jaded humanity. The tens who now seek it will be\r\nexchanged for hundreds in quest of the health and vigor that are inhaled\r\nwith every breath of the fresh salt air. There is, it must be admitted,\r\na certain amount of resignation in our view of such a transformation. We\r\nwish for no change in Montauk--would not even ask for the iron road to\r\nspan the waste of Neapeague. All around is beauty--of the sky, of the\r\nsea, of lake and land--beauty of wavy outline and delicious color. There\r\nis a deep pleasure also in the feeling that we are here away from the\r\nworld. Care went riding down the wind into the marshes of the Water\r\nLand, and we are emancipated from drudgery and routine. The workshop has\r\nreceded so far from its usual prominence that it is almost out of\r\nmemory, a thousand miles away. Why should it be brought nearer and\r\nMontauk be made a portion of the old, every-day world?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTAUK LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBut to turn to the present. To the east of the hill upon which we stand\r\nlies Great Pond, the largest sheet of water on Long Island, and across\r\nit may be seen the Shagwannock Hills. And now we may return to the point\r\nwhence we started at the south end of Fort Pond, and resume our drive\r\nacross the downs. Soon after passing Stratton's, the third house between\r\nNeapeague and the point, the road makes a sweeping detour to the south,\r\nbringing us nearer to the sea-cliff, and we hastened to reach the\r\nlighthouse before the night made the rough track dangerous. The sky was\r\nthreatening, and had to the west and north-west an aspect ominous of\r\nstorm. It was on that night that Wallingford was swept almost out of\r\nexistence by a tornado. Before we arrived at the lighthouse the\r\nlightning was playing brilliantly over the dense mass of clouds that\r\noverhung the Connecticut shore. Gradually the black bank drifted\r\neastward, and then to the south, and as it drew near the rumble of the\r\nthunder became more audible. By and by a counter-current of wind seemed\r\nto set in toward the south-west, and a part of the huge vapory mass was\r\nbroken off from the rest and whirled directly overhead. The unceasing\r\nroar of the surf was drowned by the thunder, and the foam-crested waves\r\nthat came curling into Turtle Bay were lit up by the glare of the\r\nlightning. Toward the east the darting forks of fire seemed now to flash\r\ndown into the inky sea, and now to throw a baleful and blinding light\r\naround the lighthouse. What made the phenomenon singular was that the\r\nwind had been blowing a southerly gale all day, and that for a time the\r\nmotion of the clouds appeared to be entirely independent of the wind. A\r\nheavy rainstorm accompanied the thunder, and it was in the midst of this\r\nelemental chaos that we first looked out upon the ocean from Womponomon.\r\nSoon, however, the heavy cloud passed away to sea, and again\r\n\r\n              The pale and quiet moon\r\n          Makes her calm forehead bare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLIFFS OF MONTAUK.]\r\n\r\nIn the morning a dull gray sky hung over the still-vext ocean, and upon\r\nits long swell a few fishing craft were riding at anchor. The view from\r\nthe lighthouse, the lantern of which was presented to the United States\r\nby the French government, is worth all and far more than is ever likely\r\nto be passed through in reaching it. Block Island lay like a dark mark\r\ndeepening the horizon-line, and to the south and east were ships passing\r\ngallantly out to sea. To the north the view was hazy, and to the west\r\nwere the hills of Montauk and glimpses of its ponds. Round the point the\r\nwater was comparatively still, but the long swell was breaking grandly\r\namong the boulders on the south. Below the lantern is the room in which\r\nthe keepers maintain their vigils, listening to the roar of the wind,\r\nand occasionally feeling the tower vibrate to such an extent that the\r\nlantern ceases its revolutions. This, however, rarely happens. The tower\r\nis strongly built of stone and brick, and, although it has seen many a\r\nstorm since 1795, it is staunch enough to weather many more.\r\n\r\nDown under the cliffs, where the \"cruel, hungry foam\" is dashing among\r\nthe rocks, the seaward view is grand and awful. In Turtle Bay, as we\r\ncasually learned, the dead bodies of those shipwrecked farther up the\r\ncoast generally come ashore, and a ghastly kind of interest attaches to\r\nthe place. For miles along the shore the same sad tale is being\r\ncontinually told: it is the solemn burden of the sea's loud wail. We\r\nheard it at Fire Island; walking along the beach opposite Sayville, we\r\nheard it again in the billows that broke over the wreck of the Great\r\nWestern; it haunted us at Quogue, and rang in our ears on the lovely\r\nbeach at the Hamptons; it followed us to Amagansett, and within a few\r\nmiles of the point we can sit in a veritable \"graveyard\" filled with\r\nbeams, broken timbers and rusty iron bolts, the rejected spoils of the\r\nocean. For the moment one cannot help sympathizing with the shepherd of\r\nthe _Noctes_, who \"couldna thole to lieve on the seashore.\" There is, in\r\ntruth, something disturbing to the imagination and confusing to the\r\nsenses in its everlasting thunder. We see it and leave it--perhaps for a\r\nmonth, possibly for a year--and it is hard to realize when we return\r\nthat throughout the long interval it has never for a single moment been\r\nat rest.\r\n\r\nBut the time comes when we must retrace our steps to the world which\r\nseems so far away. Again we roll over the pasture-land, swept by\r\nconstant winds, sometimes by storms, and long before we reach Neapeague\r\nhave learned the truth and felt the sentiment that inspired Ayres's\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n          There is no country like Montauk's rude isle.\r\n          Strange are its rolling hills, its valleys' smile,\r\n          Its trees lone dying in their ancient place,\r\n          As if in sorrow for a dying race.\r\n\r\n              JENNIE J. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FOR PERCIVAL.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT OF PERCIVAL'S ECONOMY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nJudith's letter lay on the table still. Bertie had not come to claim it,\r\nand she had not come home.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained these facts, Percival went to his own room, and,\r\nfinding his tea set ready for him, ate and drank hurriedly, hesitating\r\nwhether he should go and meet her. Standing by the window he looked out\r\non the darkening street. All vulgarity of detail was lost in the\r\nsoftening dusk, and there was something almost picturesque in the\r\nopposite roof, whose outline was delicately drawn on the pale-blue sky.\r\nEverything was refined, subdued and shadowy in the tender light, but\r\nPercival, gazing, saw no charm in the little twilight picture. Sorrow\r\nmay be soothed by quiet loveliness, but perplexities absorb all our\r\nfaculties, and we do not heed the beauty of the world, which is simple\r\nand unperplexed. If it is forced upon our notice, the contrast irritates\r\nus: it is almost an impertinence. Percival would have been angry had he\r\nbeen called upon to feel the poetry which Bertie had found only a few\r\ndays before in the bit of houseleek growing on that arid waste of tiles.\r\nIt is true that in that dim light the houseleek was only a dusky little\r\nknob.\r\n\r\nShould he go and meet Judith? Should he wait for her? What would she do?\r\nShould he go to St. Sylvester's? By the time he could reach the church\r\nthe choristers would have assembled: would the organist be there? While\r\nhe doubted what to do his fingers were in his waistcoat pocket, and he\r\nincidentally discovered that he had only a shilling and a\r\nthreepenny-piece in it. He went quickly to the table and struck a light.\r\nSince he had enrolled himself as Judith Lisle's true knight, ready to go\r\nanywhere or render her any service in her need, it would be as well to\r\nbe better provided with the sinews of war. He unlocked the little\r\nwriting-case which stood on a side table.\r\n\r\nPercival's carefulness in money matters had helped him very much in his\r\npoverty. It seemed the most natural thing in the world to him that,\r\nsince his income was fixed, his expenditure must be made to fit it. He\r\nhardly understood the difficulties of that numerous class of which\r\nBertie was an example--men who consider certain items of expenditure as\r\nfixed and unchangeable, let their income be what it may. But Percival\r\nhad retained one remembrance of his wealthier days, a familiarity with\r\nmoney. People who have been stinted all their lives are accustomed to\r\nhandle silver and copper, but are anxious about gold and frightened at\r\nnotes or cheques. Percival, though he was quite conscious of the\r\nrelative greatness of small sums to his narrow means, retained the old\r\nhabit of thinking them small, and never bestowed an anxious thought on\r\nthe little hoard in his desk. As he went to it that evening he\r\nremembered with sudden pleasure that there was the money that had been\r\naccumulating for some time in readiness for Mrs. Bryant's return. He\r\ncould borrow from that if need were.\r\n\r\nThe money was gone.\r\n\r\nPercival stood up and stared vaguely round the room. Then, unable to\r\nbelieve in his misfortune, he emptied out the contents of the desk upon\r\nthe table and tossed them over in a hurried search. A carelessly-folded\r\npaper caught his eye as something unfamiliar. He opened it and read:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR THORNE: You were good enough to let me borrow of you once\r\n     when I was in a scrape. I am in a worse difficulty now, and, as I\r\n     have not the chance of asking your leave, I've ventured to help\r\n     myself. You shall have it back again in a few days, with an\r\n     explanation of this cool proceeding.\"\r\n\r\n          \"H.L.\"\r\n\r\nPercival threw the letter down, and walked to the window again. It was\r\nclear enough now. Bertie had had no need to borrow eight or nine pounds\r\nif he were only going out for the day to inquire about a situation as\r\norganist. But if a man is running off with a young lady it will not do\r\nto have an absolutely empty purse. Even though she may be an heiress, he\r\ncannot very well begin by asking her to pay his railway-fare. \"It would\r\ndefine the relative positions a little _too_ clearly,\" thought Percival\r\nwith a scornful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Will she hope still?\" was his next thought. \"It is not utterly\r\nimpossible, I suppose, that Master Bertie has bolted alone. One couldn't\r\nswear he hadn't. Bolted he certainly has, but if she _will_ hope I can't\r\nsay that I know he has gone with Miss Nash. Though I am sure he has: how\r\nelse would he undertake to repay me in a few days? Unless that is only a\r\nfigure of speech.\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly remembered the time when Bertie left his debt unpaid after a\r\nsimilar promise, and he went back to his desk with a new anxiety. His\r\ntalisman, the half-sovereign which was to have been treasured to his\r\ndying day, had shared the fate of the commonplace coins which were\r\ndestined for Mrs. Bryant and his bootmaker. It was a cruel blow, but\r\nPercival saw the absurd side of his misfortune, and laughed aloud in\r\nspite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"My sentiment hasn't prospered: it might just as well have been a\r\nthree-penny-piece! Ah, well! it would be unreasonable to complain,\" he\r\nreflected, \"since Bertie has promised to send my souvenir back again.\r\nVery thoughtful of him! It will be a little remembrance of Emmeline Nash\r\nwhen it comes, and not of Judith Lisle: that will be the only\r\ndifference. Quite unimportant, of course. Upon my word, Lisle went about\r\nit in a systematic fashion. Pity he gave his attention to music: a\r\ndistinguished burglar was lost to society when he turned organist.\" He\r\ntook up the paper and glanced at it again. \"If I show this to her she\r\nwill pay his debt, as she did last time; and that she never shall do.\"\r\nHe doubled it up and thrust it in with the rest.\r\n\r\nA shuffling step in the passage, a knock at the door, and Emma made her\r\nappearance: \"Miss Lisle has come in, sir.\"\r\n\r\nPercival looked up a little astonished, but he only thanked her in his\r\nquiet voice and closed his desk. He turned the key, and waited a moment\r\ntill Emma should have gone before he obeyed the summons. When, answering\r\nJudith's \"Come in,\" he entered the Lisles' room, he found her standing\r\nby the window. She turned and looked at him, as if she were not quite\r\ncertain whom to expect.\r\n\r\n\"It is I,\" he said. \"Thank you for sending for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sending for you? I didn't send. But I am glad you came,\" she added.\r\n\r\nShe had not sent for him, and Percival remembered that he had passed\r\nLydia Bryant on his way. The message--which, after all, was a mere\r\nstatement of a fact--was hers. He colored angrily and stood confused:\r\n\"You did not send? No--I see. I beg your pardon--I misunderstood--\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes no difference,\" said Judith quickly. \"Don't go: I wanted to\r\ntell you--\" She paused: \"I have not been unjust, Mr. Thorne. Mr. Nash\r\nhas been at Standon Square this afternoon. After he had my telegram he\r\nreceived a letter from Emmeline, and it was as I thought. She is with\r\nBertie.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Bertie? And he came here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--to see if it was as Emmeline said, that they were married at St.\r\nAndrew's last Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\nPercival looked blankly at her: \"Married! It isn't possible, is it?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT IS I,\" HE SAID. \"THANK YOU FOR SENDING FOR ME.\"--Page\r\n542.]\r\n\r\n\"Quite possible,\" said Judith bitterly. \"Standon Square is in St.\r\nAndrew's parish, as well as Bellevue street. It seems that Bertie had\r\nonly to have the banns mumbled over for three Sundays by an old\r\nclergyman whom nobody hears in a church where nobody goes. It sounds\r\nvery easy, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nPercival stood for a moment speechless while the cool audacity of\r\nBertie's proceeding filtered slowly into his mind. \"But if any one had\r\ngone to St. Andrew's?\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"That would have ended it, of course. I suppose he would have run away\r\nwithout Emmeline. If I had gone that Sunday when I had arranged to go,\r\nfor instance. Yes, that would have been very awkward, wouldn't it, Mr.\r\nThorne? Only, you see, Bertie happened to be ill that morning, and I\r\ncouldn't leave him. You remember you were good enough to go to church\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" said Percival with a scornful smile as he recalled the\r\ndevoted attention with which he had escorted the young organist to St.\r\nSylvester's.\r\n\r\n\"He must have enjoyed that walk, I should think,\" said Judith, still\r\nvery quietly. Her unopened note was on the table, where she had placed\r\nit that morning. She took it up and tore it into a hundred pieces. \"You\r\nhave heard people talk of broken hearts, haven't you?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Often,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Bertie has broken Miss Crawford's. She said this morning\r\nthat she should never hold up her head again if this were true; and I\r\nbelieve she never will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean she will die of it?\" said Thorne, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Not directly, perhaps, but I am sure she will die the sooner for it.\r\nAll her pride in her life's work is gone. She feels that she is\r\ndisgraced. I could not bear to see her this afternoon, utterly ashamed\r\nand humble before that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some things I won't tell you.\" A quick blush dyed her face. \"Naturally,\r\nhe was angry: he had good reason to be. And when he told her she was\r\npast her work, she moaned, poor thing! while the tears rained down her\r\ncheeks, and only said, 'God forgive me--yes.'\"\r\n\r\nPercival could but echo her pity. \"Bertie never thought--\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Never thought? When our trouble came,\" said Judith, \"we had plenty of\r\nfriends better able to do something for us, but, somehow, they didn't.\r\nAnd when there was the talk of Bertie's coming here, and I remembered\r\nher and asked her if she could help me to a situation anywhere in the\r\nneighborhood, she wrote to me to come to her at once, and she would do\r\nall she could to help Bertie too. I have her letter still. She said she\r\nlonged to know me for my mother's sake, and was sure she would soon love\r\nme for my own. And this afternoon she prayed God she might never see my\r\nface again!\"\r\n\r\n\"She thinks you are to blame, then?\" said Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and am I not?\" was the quick reply. \"Ought I not to have known\r\nBertie better? And I did know him: that is the worst of it. I did not\r\nexpect this, and yet I ought to have been on my guard. He has been my\r\none study from first to last. From the time that he was a little\r\nboy--the bonniest little boy that ever was!--my life has been all\r\nBertie. I remember him, with long curls hanging down his back and his\r\ngray eyes opened wide, when he stood on tiptoe at the piano and touched\r\nthe little tunes that he had heard, and looked over his shoulder at me\r\nand laughed for pleasure in his music. I can see his little\r\nbaby-fingers--the little soft fingers I used to kiss--on the keys\r\nnow.--Oh, Bertie, why didn't you die then?\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped as if checked by a sudden thought, and looked so quickly up\r\nat Percival that she caught an answer in his eyes that he would never\r\nhave uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, he would have been the same,\" she said. \"He _was_ the same\r\nthen: I know it. They used to praise me, when I was a child, for giving\r\neverything up to Bertie. As if he were not my happiness! And it has been\r\nso always. And now I have sacrificed Miss Crawford to Bertie--my dear\r\nold friend, my mother's friend, who is worth ten times as much as Bertie\r\never was or ever will be! Is not this a fine ending of all?\"\r\n\r\nPercival broke the silence after a moment's pause. \"_Is_ it an ending of\r\nall?\" he said. \"Bertie has been very wrong, but it has been partly\r\nthoughtlessness. He is very young, and if he should do well hereafter\r\nmay there not even yet be a future to which you may look forward? As for\r\nthe world, it is not disposed to look on a runaway match of this sort as\r\na crime.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes full upon him, and he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the world!\" she said. \"The world will consider it a sort of young\r\nLochinvar affair, no doubt. But how much of the young Lochinvar do you\r\nthink there is about Bertie, Mr. Thorne? You have heard him speak of\r\nEmmeline Nash sometimes--not as often nor as freely as he has spoken to\r\nme; still, you have heard him. And judging from that, do you believe he\r\nis in love with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--no,\" said Thorne reluctantly. \"Hardly that.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand times no! If by any possibility he had loved her, foolishly,\r\nmadly, with a passion that blinded him to the cruel wrong he was doing,\r\nit would all have been different. I should have blamed him, but in spite\r\nof Miss Crawford I should have forgiven him; I should have had hope; he\r\nwould have been my Bertie still; I should not have despised him. But\r\nthis is cold and base and horrible: he has simply sold himself for\r\nEmmeline's money--sold himself, his smiles and his pretty speeches and\r\nhis handsome face. And now it is all over.\"\r\n\r\nAs Judith spoke Percival understood for the first time what a woman's\r\nvoice could be. The girl's soul was filled and shaken with passion. She\r\ndid not cry aloud nor rant, but every accent thrilled through him from\r\nhead to foot. And it seemed to him that she needed no words--that, had\r\nshe been speaking in an unknown tongue, the very intonation, the mere\r\nsound, the vibration of her voice, would have told him of her wounded\r\nheart, her despair, her unavailing sorrow, her bitter shame, so eloquent\r\nit was. He did not think all this, but in a passing moment felt it. \"I\r\nfear it is all too true,\" he said. \"I don't know what to say nor how to\r\nhelp you. Your brother--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't call him that: he is no brother of mine. Ah yes, God help me, he\r\n_is_ my brother; and I think we Lisles bring sorrow to all who are good\r\nto us. We have to you, have we not? Don't stay here, Mr. Thorne: don't\r\ntry to help me. Remember that I am of the same blood as my father, who\r\nrobbed you--as Bertie, who has been so base.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if Judas himself were your brother, what then?\" Percival demanded.\r\nHis voice, in its masculine vigor and fulness, broke forth suddenly,\r\nlike a strong creature held till then in a leash. \"And as for the money,\r\nwhat of that? I am glad it is gone, or I should not have been here\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\nNo, he would not have needed to turn clerk and earn his living. He would\r\nnot have gone to Brackenhill to confess his poverty. He might never have\r\ndiscovered anything. Most likely he would long since have been Sissy's\r\nhusband. Sissy seemed far away now. He had loved her--yes. Oh, poor\r\nlittle Sissy, who had clung to him! But what were these new feelings\r\nthat thronged his heart as he looked at Judith Lisle? He stopped\r\nabruptly. What had he said?\r\n\r\nJudith too looked at him, and grew suddenly calm and still. \"You are\r\nvery good,\" she said. \"I should have been very lonely to-day if I had\r\nnot had a friend. It has been a comfort to speak out what I felt, though\r\nI'm afraid I've talked foolishly.\"\r\n\r\n\"One can't weigh all one's words,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered; \"and I know you will not remember my folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I will not forget that you have trusted me. You are\r\ntired,\" he said gently: \"you ought to rest. There is nothing to be done\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" she answered hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\"And to-morrow, if there is anything that I can do, you will send for\r\nme, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Promise me that,\" he urged in a tone of authority. \"You will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I promise.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, when clouds roll up, black with thunder and rain, to\r\novershadow the heavens and to deluge the earth, between their masses\r\nyou may catch a momentary gleam of blue, faint and infinitely far away,\r\ndeep, untroubled, most beautiful. Judith had caught such a glimpse that\r\nevening as she bade Percival good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the elopement was in all the local papers, which seemed for\r\nonce to be printed on Judith Lisle's heart. It was the latest and most\r\nexciting topic of conversation in the neighborhood of Standon Square and\r\nSt. Sylvester's, and was made doubly interesting by the utter collapse\r\nof Mr. Clifton's Easter services, which were to have been something very\r\nremarkable indeed. Every one recollected the young organist who was so\r\nhandsome and who played so divinely. People forgot that his father had\r\nfailed very disgracefully, and only remembered that Bertie had once been\r\nin a much better position. There was a sort of general impression that\r\nhe was an aristocratic young hero who lived in lofty poverty, and was a\r\ngenius into the bargain. No one was very precise about it, but Beethoven\r\nand Mendelssohn and all those people were likely to find themselves\r\neclipsed some fine morning. Emmeline Nash of course became a heroine to\r\nmatch, vaguely sketched as slim, tall and fair. She had stayed on at\r\nMiss Crawford's at an age when a girl's education is generally supposed\r\nto be finished, and she had not always gone home for the holidays. These\r\nfacts were of course the germs of a romance. There was a quarrel with\r\nher father, who wished her to marry some one. No one knew who the some\r\none might be, but as he was only a shadowy figure in the background, his\r\nname was of no importance. Emmeline and her music-master had fallen in\r\nlove at first sight; and when the moment came for the girl to return\r\nhome, to be persecuted by her father's threats and by the attentions of\r\nthe shadowy lover, her heart had failed her and she had consented to fly\r\nwith the young musician. As Judith had said, it was a young Lochinvar\r\nromance--a boy-and-girl attachment. No one seemed to think much the\r\nworse of Bertie. Hardly any one called him a fortune-hunter, for\r\nEmmeline's money seemed trivial compared with the wealth that he was\r\nsupposed to have once possessed. And no one thought anything at all of\r\nJudith herself or of Miss Crawford.\r\n\r\nIt would soon be over and forgotten, but Judith suffered acutely while\r\nit lasted. Perhaps it was well that she was forced to think about her\r\nown prospects, which were none of the brightest.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you go to Rookleigh?\" Percival asked her a couple of days later.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head: \"No: I'm too proud, I suppose, or too miserable: I\r\ncan't have my failure here talked over. Aunt Lisle's conversation is\r\nfull of sharp little pin-pricks, which are all very well when they don't\r\ngo straight into one's heart.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her lip quiver as she turned her face away. \"Where will you go,\r\nthen?\" he asked with gentle persistence. It was partly on his own\r\naccount, for he feared that a blow was in store for him, and he wanted\r\nto know the worst.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not go anywhere. I shall not leave Brenthill.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood seemed to rush strongly to his heart: his veins were full of\r\nwarm life. She would not leave Brenthill!\r\n\r\n\"I will stay, at any rate, while Miss Crawford remains here. She will\r\nnot speak to me, she has forbidden me to attempt to see her, but I\r\ncannot go away and leave her here alone. I may not be of any use--I do\r\nnot suppose I shall be--but while she is here I will not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if she left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I would not leave Brenthill if I could get any work to do. I\r\nfeel as if I must stay here, if only to show that I have not gone away\r\nwith Bertie to live on Emmeline's money. Poor Emmeline! And when he used\r\nto talk of my not working any more, and he would provide for me, I\r\nthought he meant that he would make a fortune with his opera. What a\r\nfool I was!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a folly to be proud of.\"\r\n\r\nHe was rewarded with a faint smile, but the delicate curve of the\r\ngirl's lips relaxed into sadness all too soon.\r\n\r\nThe table at her side was strewn with sheets of roughly-blotted music,\r\nmixed with others daintily neat, which Judith herself had copied. \"His\r\nopera,\" she repeated, laying the leaves in order. \"Emmeline will be\r\npromoted to the office of critic and admirer now, I suppose. But I think\r\nthe admiration will be too indiscriminate even for Bertie. Poor\r\nEmmeline!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with all these?\" said Thorne, laying his hand\r\non the papers.\r\n\r\n\"I am putting them together to send to him. I had a letter this morning,\r\nso I know his address now. He seems very hopeful, as usual, and thinks\r\nher father will forgive them before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you think there is a chance of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't. Bertie did not hear what Mr. Nash said that afternoon to\r\nMiss Crawford and to me,\" she replied; and once again the color rushed\r\nto her face at the remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lisle,\" said Percival suddenly, \"I am ready to make every\r\nallowance for Mr. Nash, but if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing. He was angry, as he had reason to be: that was all.\r\nAnd you see I am not used to angry men.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope not. I wish I had been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I don't,\" said Judith softly. \"I think you might not have been very\r\npatient, and I felt that one ought to be patient for Miss Crawford's\r\nsake. Besides, if you had been there I could not have--Bertie writes in\r\ncapital spirits,\" she continued with a sudden change of tone. \"He wants\r\nme to go and join them. He is just the same as ever, only rather proud\r\nof himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proud of himself! In Heaven's name, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he is only two-and-twenty, and has secured a comfortable income\r\nfor the rest of his life by his own exertions. Naturally, he is proud of\r\nhimself.\" Percival had learned now that Judith never suffered more\r\nkeenly than when she spoke of Bertie in a jesting tone, and it pained\r\nhim for her sake. He looked sorrowfully at her. \"Mr. Thorne,\" she went\r\non, \"he does not even suspect that what he has done is anything but\r\npraiseworthy and rather clever. He does not so much as mention Miss\r\nCrawford. And I am haunted by a feeling that we have somehow wronged my\r\nmother by wronging her old friend.\"\r\n\r\nPercival did not tell her that he too had had a letter from Bertie. It\r\nwas in his pocket as he stood there, and when he went away he took it\r\nout and read it again.\r\n\r\nBertie was as light-hearted as she had said. He enclosed an order for\r\nthe money taken from the desk, and hoped Thorne had not wanted it; or,\r\nif he had been put to any inconvenience, he must forgive him this once,\r\nas he, Lisle, did not suppose he should ever run away in that style\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"I think the old man will come round without much fuss,\" Bertie went on.\r\n\"We have been very penitent--the waste of note-paper before we could get\r\nour feelings properly expressed was something frightful; but the money\r\nwas well laid out, for we have heard from him again, and there is a\r\nperceptible softening in the tone of his letter. Emmeline assures me\r\nthat he is passionately fond of music, and reminds me how anxious he was\r\nthat she should learn to play. The reasoning does not exactly convince\r\nme, but if the old fellow does but imagine that he has a passion for\r\nmusic I will conquer him through that. And if the worst comes to the\r\nworst, and he is as stony-hearted as one of his own fossils, we have\r\nonly to manage for this year, and we must come into our money when\r\nEmmeline is twenty-one. But I have no fear. He will relent, and we shall\r\nbe comfortably settled under the paternal roof long before Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"What did old Clifton say and do when he found I had bolted? And how did\r\nthe Easter services go off? Those blessed Easter services that he was in\r\nsuch a state of mind about! Was he very savage? Send me as graphic a\r\ndescription as you can.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse a smudge, but Emmeline and I are bound to do a good deal of\r\nhugging and kissing just now--a honeymoon after an elopement is\r\nsomething remarkably sweet, as you may suppose--and her sleeve brushed\r\nthe wet ink. This particular embrace was on the occasion of her\r\ndeparture to put on her things. We are going out.\r\n\r\n\"Don't they say that married women always give up their accomplishments?\r\nEmmeline is a married woman, therefore Emmeline will give up her music.\r\nHow soon do you suppose she will begin?\"\r\n\r\nHalf a page more of Bertie's random scribble brought him to a\r\nconclusion, but it was not a final one, for he had added a couple of\r\nlines: \"P.S. Persuade J. to shake herself free of Brenthill as soon as\r\npossible: there can be no need for her to work now, thank God! You know\r\nit has always been my day-dream and hope to provide for her. You must\r\ncome and see us too. Come soon, before we go to my father-in-law's.\r\nGood-bye: we are off.--P.S. No. 2. No, we are not. E. has forgotten her\r\nparasol, and is gone for it. How is Lydia? What did she say when she\r\nheard the news? I suppose by this time everybody knows it.\"\r\n\r\nPercival's lip curved with scorn and disgust as he refolded the letter,\r\nin which Emmeline, Judith and Lydia jostled each other as they might\r\nhave done in a bad dream. Then he looked up, being suddenly aware of\r\neyes that were fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nMiss Bryant stood in the doorway: \"You've heard from _him_, Mr. Thorne?\"\r\n\r\nPercival did not choose to answer as if he were in Miss Bryant's secrets\r\nand knew as a matter of course that \"_him_\" meant Lisle. Neither did he\r\nchoose to say that he did not know who was intended by the energetic\r\npronoun. He looked back at Lydia politely and inquiringly, as if he\r\nawaited further information before he could be expected to reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" said Lydia scornfully. \"You have heard from Mr. Bertie\r\nLisle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Percival acquiesced gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--what, Miss Bryant?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\" Lydia demanded; and when Thorne arched his brows,\r\n\"Oh, you needn't look as if you thought it wasn't my business. I've a\r\nright to ask after him, at any rate, for old acquaintance' sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear you take so much interest in him,\" he rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"Why? You may keep your sorrow for your own affairs: I'll manage mine. I\r\ncan take very good care of myself, I assure you, and I won't trouble you\r\nto be sorry for me,\" said Lydia shortly. I do not think she had ever\r\nspoken to a young man before and been unconscious that it _was_ a young\r\nman to whom she spoke. But she was utterly heedless of Percival as she\r\nquestioned him, and he perceived it, and preferred this angry mood.\r\n\"Can't you tell me anything about him?\" said the girl. \"Is he\r\nwell--happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"He writes in the best of spirits.\"\r\n\r\nLydia advanced a step or two: \"And is it all true what they are saying?\r\nHe has married this young lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has married her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you suppose he cares for her?\" said Lydia slowly.\r\n\r\nThome's brows went up again: \"Really, Miss Bryant--\"\r\n\r\n\"Because if he does, he has told lies enough: that's all.\"\r\n\r\n(\"And he isn't a miracle of honor if he doesn't,\" said Percival.)\r\n\r\n\"But that's quite likely,\" Lydia went on, unheeding. \"I knew all the\r\ntime that he didn't mean any good. He thought I believed him, but I\r\ndidn't--not more than half, anyhow. But when he went away I didn't guess\r\nit was for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew he was going?\" Thorne said.\r\n\r\nLydia half smiled, in conscious superiority.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to have served yourself particularly well by keeping his\r\nsecrets. You are deceived at last, like the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I haven't served myself I've served him,\" said Lydia. \"And I\r\ndon't know but what I am glad of it. He wasn't as stuck-up and proud as\r\nsome people. One likes to be looked at and spoken to as if one wasn't\r\ndirt under people's feet. And, after all, I don't see that there's any\r\nharm done.\" There were red rims to Lydia's eyes, telling of tears which\r\nmust surely have been too persistent to pass for tears of joy at the\r\ntidings of Bertie's elopement. \"I suppose a marriage like that is all\r\nright?\" she asked with a quick glance.\r\n\r\n\"Of course--no doubt of it,\" said Percival very shortly. He had pitied\r\nher a moment earlier.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I supposed so. But things ain't always all right when people run\r\naway. And the money's all right too, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of it, at any rate,\" said Thorne, taking a book from the table.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't he be sure to take care of that! And there's more to come if\r\nthe father likes, isn't there? He'll get that too: see if he doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to be hoped he will--for Mrs. Lisle's sake. Otherwise, I cannot\r\nsay I care to discuss his prospects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lydia after a pause, during which she turned a ring slowly\r\non her finger--\"well, I'll wish him all the happiness he deserves.\"\r\n\r\nPercival's lip curved a little: \"Miss Bryant, are you absolutely\r\npitiless?\"\r\n\r\nLydia's expression was rather blank. \"What do you mean? No, I ain't,\"\r\nshe said. \"I've nothing more to do with him. He hasn't done me any harm,\r\nand I won't wish him any. At least, only a little.\" With which small\r\nebullition of feminine tenderness and spite she fled hurriedly down\r\nstairs to shed a few more tears, and left Thorne to write his letter to\r\nLisle. It was brief, and none the sweeter for that recent interview.\r\n\r\n\"I return the money,\" Percival wrote, \"which you say was so useful to\r\nyou. I know that what you have sent me is not yours, but your wife's,\r\nand I cannot conscientiously say that I think Mrs. Herbert Lisle is\r\nindebted to me in any way.\r\n\r\n\"I have not delivered your message to your sister. I have no wish to\r\ninsult her in her trouble, and I know she would feel such persuasion a\r\ncruel insult, as indeed I think it would be.\"\r\n\r\nJudith at the same time was writing:\r\n\r\n\"From this time our paths must lie apart. I will never touch a penny of\r\nyour wife's money. Do not dare to offer me a share of it again. It seems\r\nto me that all the shame and sorrow is mine, and you have only the\r\nprosperity. Not for the whole world would I change burdens with you.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Crawford is going to give up her school at once. She will not see\r\nor speak to me, for she suspects me of having been your accomplice. And\r\nI cannot help blaming myself that I trusted you so foolishly. But I\r\ncould not have believed that you would have been false to her--our one\r\nfriend, our mother's friend. Is it possible that you do not see that\r\nevery one under her roof should have been sacred to you? But what is the\r\nuse of saying anything now?\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, after this, how to appeal to you, and I don't want any\r\npromises; but if you feel any regret for the pain you have caused, and\r\nif you really wish to do anything for me, I entreat you to be good to\r\nEmmeline. It is the only favor I will ever ask of you. She is young and\r\nweak, poor girl! and she has trusted you utterly. In God's name, do not\r\nrepay her trust as you have repaid Miss Crawford's and mine!\"\r\n\r\nBertie's incredulous amazement was visible in every line of his answer\r\nto Percival:\r\n\r\n\"Are you both cracked--you and Judith--or am I dreaming? I have read\r\nyour letters a score of times, and I think I understand them less than I\r\ndid. Here are sweet bells jangled out of tune with a vengeance, and\r\nHeaven only knows what all the row is about: I don't.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose a man never made a runaway match before? And how could I\r\ndo otherwise than as I did? Was I to stop and consult all the old women\r\nin the parish about it--ask Miss Crawford's blessing, and get my sister\r\nto look out my train for me and pack my portmanteau? Can't you see that\r\nI was obliged to deceive you a little?\r\n\r\n\"And what is amiss with the marriage itself? It is true that just now\r\nEmmeline has the money and I have none, but do you suppose I am going to\r\nremain in obscurity all my life? A few years hence you shall own that it\r\nwas not at all a bad match for her. Old Nash is nobody, though he is\r\nclever enough in his own way. His father was a tailor, and made a good\r\nlot of money so. By the way, he is certainly coming round (Mr. Nash, I\r\nmean, not my grandfather-in-law the tailor: he is dead), and if he\r\ndoesn't object, why should anybody else?\r\n\r\n\"If I have done Miss Crawford any harm, I'm very sorry of course. Can't\r\nI help her in some way?\"\r\n\r\nThe reply to Judith's letter came in a feeble, girlish handwriting. It\r\nbegan: \"Herbert tells me you are angry with him because he deceived you\r\nabout our marriage,\" and it ended, \"Your affectionate sister, EMMELINE\r\nLISLE.\" The writer was evidently in the seventh heaven of bliss. Her\r\nletter was an attempt at persuading Judith, but it was sprinkled all\r\nover with fond allusions to Bertie--\"My dear, dear husband,\" \"my own\r\ndearest,\" \"darlingest Herbert,\" \"my own love;\" and in one place there\r\nwas an unnecessary little parenthesis: \"He is such a _dear_, you know!\"\r\nIt was silly enough to be maddening, but it was wonderfully happy, with\r\nthe writer's adoration of Bertie and her serene certainty that Bertie\r\nadored her. Clearly, no shadow of doubt had crossed Emmeline's mind.\r\nThere was not such another man in all the world as Herbert Lisle, and\r\nshe was his ideal woman. Every other girl must envy her the prize she\r\nhad won. Even his sister was jealous and angry when she found that she\r\nheld only the second place in his affections. Emmeline, elated by her\r\nproud position, reasoned sweetly with the unreasonable Judith, who read\r\nthe foolish scribble with mingled irritation, laughter, contempt, and\r\nalmost tears. At the end were three lines in another hand: \"Judith, you\r\n_must_ let me send you some money. If you don't understand why yet, you\r\nwill soon. You really must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he think I can't get a situation without his help?\" Judith\r\nwondered. She smiled, for she had found one. Mrs. Barton had come to her\r\nassistance--Mrs. Barton, whose stupid little daughter Judith was still\r\npatiently teaching. She understood the girl's wish to remain at\r\nBrenthill: she believed in her and sympathized with her, and exerted\r\nherself in her behalf. She brought her the offer of a situation in a\r\nschool for little boys, where she would live in the house and have a\r\nsmall salary. \"It won't be like Miss Crawford's, you know,\" the good\r\nlady said.\r\n\r\n\"It will do, whatever it is,\" Judith answered.\r\n\r\n\"It is a school of quite a different class. Miss Macgregor is a woman\r\nwho drives hard bargains. She will overwork you, I'm afraid: I only hope\r\nshe won't underfeed you. You will certainly be underpaid. She takes\r\nadvantage of the cause of your leaving Standon Square, and of the fact\r\nthat you can't ask Miss Crawford for testimonials. She is delighted at\r\nthe idea of getting a really good teacher for next to nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, it is in Brenthill,\" said Judith, \"and that is the great thing.\r\nThank you very much, Mrs. Barton. I will take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will reopen school in about ten days.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will suit me very well, won't it? I must pack up here, and settle\r\neverything.\" And Judith cast a desolate glance round the room where she\r\nhad come with such happy hopes to begin a new life with Bertie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barton's eyes were fixed on her. \"I am half inclined now to wish I\r\nhadn't said anything about Miss Macgregor at all,\" she remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Why? If you only knew how grateful I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it. Grateful! And that schoolmistress will work you to\r\ndeath: I know she will.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must take a little time about it,\" said the girl with a smile.\r\n\"Perhaps before she has quite finished I may hear of something else.\r\nWhat I want is something to enable me to stay at Brenthill, and this\r\nwill answer the purpose.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Barton stood up to go. \"I've made one stipulation,\" she said.\r\n\"Miss Macgregor will let you come to us every Wednesday afternoon to\r\ngive Janie her lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how good you are!\" Judith exclaimed. \"I thought all that must be\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could have you altogether,\" Mrs. Barton said. \"It would be\r\ncharming for Janie, and for me too. But, unfortunately, that can't be.\"\r\nShe had her hand on the handle of the half-open door. As she spoke there\r\nwas a quick step on the stairs, and Percival Thorne went by. A slanting\r\nlight from the window in the passage fell on his sombre, olive-tinted\r\nface with a curiously picturesque effect. An artist might have painted\r\nhim, emerging thus from the dusky shadows. He carried himself with a\r\ndefiant pride--was he not Judith's friend and champion?--and bowed, with\r\na glance that was at once eager and earnest, when he caught sight of the\r\nyoung girl behind her friend's substantial figure. His strongly-marked\r\ncourtesy was so evidently natural that it could not strike any one as an\r\nexaggeration of ordinary manners, but rather as the perfection of some\r\nother manners, no matter whether those of a nation or a time, or only\r\nhis own. Mrs. Barton was startled and interested by the sudden\r\napparition. The good lady was romantic in her tastes, and this was like\r\na glimpse of a living novel. \"Who was that?\" she asked hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thorne. He lodges here,\" said Judith.\r\n\r\n\"A friend of your brother's?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very good to my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Barton. \"My dear, he is very handsome.\"\r\n\r\nJudith smiled.\r\n\r\n\"He is!\" exclaimed her friend. \"Don't say he isn't, for I sha'n't\r\nbelieve you mean it. He is _very_ handsome--like a Spaniard, like a\r\ncavalier, like some one in a tragedy. Now, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Barton's romantic feelings found no outlet in her daily round of\r\nhousehold duties. Mr. Barton was good, but commonplace; so was Janie;\r\nand Mrs. Barton was quite conscious that there was nothing poetical or\r\nstriking in her own appearance. But Miss Lisle, with her \"great, grave\r\ngriefful air,\" was fit to take a leading part in poem or drama, and here\r\nwas a man worthy to play hero passing her on the staircase of a dingy\r\nlodging-house! Mrs. Barton built up a romance in a moment, and was quite\r\nimpatient to bid Judith farewell, that she might work out the details as\r\nshe walked along the street.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious hero of her romance was divided between pleasure and\r\nregret when he heard of the treaty concluded with Miss Macgregor. It was\r\nmuch that Judith could remain at Brenthill, but one day, on his way to\r\ndinner, he went and looked at the outside of the house which was to be\r\nher home, and its aspect did not please him. It stood in a gloomy\r\nstreet: it was prim, straight, narrow, and altogether hideous. A tiny\r\nbit of arid garden in front gave it a prudish air of withdrawing from\r\nthe life and traffic of the thoroughfare. The door opened as Percival\r\nlooked, and a woman came out, frigid, thin-lipped and sandy-haired. She\r\npaused on the step and gave an order to the servant: evidently she was\r\nMiss Macgregor. Percival's heart died within him. \"That harpy!\" he said\r\nunder his breath. The door closed behind her, and there was a\r\nprison-like sound of making fast within. The young man turned and walked\r\naway, oppressed by a sense of gray dreariness. \"Will she be able to\r\nbreathe in that jail?\" he wondered to himself. \"Bellevue street is a\r\nmiserable hole, but at least one is free there.\" He prolonged his walk a\r\nlittle, and went through Standon Square. It was bright and pleasant in\r\nthe spring sunshine, and the trees in the garden had little leaves on\r\nevery twig. A man was painting the railings of Montague House, and\r\nanother was putting a brass plate on the door. There was a new name on\r\nit: Miss Crawford's reign was over for ever.\r\n\r\nPercival counted the days that still remained before Judith's bondage\r\nwould begin and Bellevue street be desolate as of old. Yet, though he\r\nprized every hour, they were miserable days. Lydia Bryant haunted\r\nhim--not with her former airs and graces, but with malicious hints in\r\nher speech and little traps set for Miss Lisle and himself. She would\r\ngladly have found an occasion for slander, and Percival read her hate of\r\nJudith in the cunning eyes which watched them both. He felt that he had\r\nalready been unwary, and his blood ran cold as he thought of possible\r\ngossip, and the manner in which Lydia's insinuations would be made.\r\nPrecious as those few days were, he longed for the end. He thought more\r\nthan once of leaving Bellevue street, but such a flight was impossible.\r\nHe was chained there by want of money. He could not pay his debt to Mrs.\r\nBryant for weeks, and he could not leave while it was unpaid. Day after\r\nday he withdrew himself more, and grew almost cold in his reserve,\r\nhoping to escape from Lydia. One morning, as they passed on the stairs,\r\nhe looked back and caught a glance from Judith never intended to meet\r\nhis eye--a sad and wondering glance--which made his heart ache, even\r\nwhile filling it with the certainty that he was needed. He answered only\r\nwith another glance. It seemed to him to convey nothing of what he felt,\r\nbut nevertheless it woke a light in the girl's eyes. Moved by a quick\r\nimpulse, Percival looked up, and following his example, Judith lifted\r\nher head and saw Miss Bryant leaning over the banisters and watching\r\nthem with a curiosity which changed to an unpleasant smile when she\r\nfound herself observed. It was a revelation to Judith. She fled into her\r\nroom, flushing hotly with indignation against Lydia for her spitefully\r\nsuggestive watchfulness; with shame for herself that Percival's sense of\r\nher danger should have been keener than her own; and with generous pride\r\nand confidence in him. Thus to have been guarded might have been an\r\nintolerable humiliation, but Judith found some sweetness even in the\r\nsting. It was something new to her to be cared for and shielded; and\r\nwhile she resolved to be more careful in future, her dominant feeling\r\nwas of disgust at the curiosity which could so misunderstand the truest\r\nand purest of friendships. \"_He_ understands me, at any rate,\" said\r\npoor Judith to herself, painfully conscious of her glowing cheeks. \"_He_\r\nunderstands me: he will not think ill of me, but he shall never have to\r\nfear for me again.\" It might be questioned whether Percival did\r\naltogether understand her. If he did, he was more enlightened than\r\nJudith herself.\r\n\r\nAfter that day she shrank from Percival, and they hardly saw each other\r\ntill she left. She knew his hours of going and coming, and was careful\r\nto remain in her room, though it might be that the knowledge drew her to\r\nthe window that looked into Bellevue street. As for Percival, though he\r\nnever sought her, it seemed to him that his sense of hearing was\r\nquickened. Judith's footstep on the stairs was always distinct to him,\r\nand the tone of her voice if she spoke to Miss Bryant or Emma was noted\r\nand remembered. It is true that this strained anxiety sometimes made him\r\nan involuntary listener to gossip or household arrangements in which\r\nMiss Lisle took no active part. One day there was a hurried conversation\r\njust outside his door.\r\n\r\n\"Did you give it to her?\" said Lydia's voice.\r\n\r\nEmma replied, \"Yes'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open? Just as it came? Just as I gave it to you?\"\r\n\r\nEmma again replied, \"Yes'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she look surprised?\"\r\n\r\n\"She gave a little jump, miss,\" said Emma deliberately, as if weighing\r\nher words, \"and she looked at it back and front.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then? Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then she laid it down and said it was quite right, and she'd see\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nLydia laughed. \"I think there'll be some more--\" she said. Percival\r\nthrew the tongs into the fender, and the dialogue came to an abrupt\r\ntermination. \"She\" who gave a little jump was Miss Lisle, of course. But\r\nthere would be some more--What? The young man revolved the matter\r\ngloomily in his mind as he paced to and fro within the narrow limits of\r\nhis room. A natural impulse had caused him to interrupt Lydia's\r\ntriumphant speech, which he knew was not intended for his ears, but her\r\nlaugh rang in the air and mocked him. What was the torture that she had\r\ndevised and whose effects she so curiously analyzed? There would be\r\nmore--What?\r\n\r\nHe thought of it that night, he thought of it the next morning, and\r\nstill he could not solve the mystery. But as he came from the office in\r\nthe middle of the day he passed his bootmaker's, and the worthy man, who\r\nwas holding the door open for a customer to go out, stopped him with an\r\napology. Percival's heart beat fast: never before had he stood face to\r\nface with a tradesman and felt that he could not pay him what he owed.\r\nHis bill had not yet been sent in, and the man had never shown any\r\ninclination to hurry him, but he was evidently going to ask for his\r\nmoney now. Percival controlled his face with an effort, prepared for the\r\nhumiliating confession of his poverty, and found that Mr. Robinson--with\r\nprofuse excuses for the trouble he was giving--was begging to be told\r\nMr. Lisle's address.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lisle's address?\" Thorne repeated the words, but as he did so the\r\nmatter suddenly became clear to him, and he went on easily: \"Oh, I ought\r\nto have told you that Mr. Lisle's account was to be sent to me. If you\r\nhave it there, I'll take it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson fetched it with more apologies. He was impressed by the\r\nlofty carelessness with which the young man thrust the paper into his\r\npocket, and as Thorne went down the street the little bootmaker looked\r\nafter him with considerable admiration: \"Any one can see he's quite the\r\ngentleman, and so was the other. This one'll make his way too, see if he\r\ndoesn't!\" Mr. Robinson imparted these opinions to Mrs. Robinson over\r\ntheir dinner, and was informed in return that he wasn't a prophet, so he\r\nneedn't think it, and the young men who gave themselves airs and wore\r\nsmart clothes weren't the ones to get on in the world; and Mrs. Robinson\r\nhad no patience with such nonsense.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Percival had gone home with his riddle answered. More--What?\r\nMore unsuspected debts, more bills of Bertie's to be sent in to the\r\npoor girl who had been so happy in the thought that, although their\r\nincome was small, at least they owed nothing. Percival's heart ached as\r\nhe pictured Judith's start of surprise when Emma carried in the open\r\npaper, her brave smile, her hurried assurance that it was all right, and\r\nLydia laughing outside at the thought of more to come. \"She'll pay them\r\nall,\" said Percival to himself. \"She won't take a farthing of that\r\ngirl's money. She'll die sooner than not pay them, but I incline to\r\nthink she won't pay this one.\" His mind was made up long before he\r\nreached Bellevue street. If by any sacrifice of pride or comfort he\r\ncould keep the privilege of helping Judith altogether to himself, he\r\nwould do so. If that were impossible he would get the money from Godfrey\r\nHammond. But he felt doubtful whether he should like Godfrey Hammond\r\nquite as well when he should have asked and received this service at his\r\nhands. \"I ought to like him all the better if he helped her when I\r\ncouldn't manage it. It would be abominably unjust if I didn't. In fact,\r\nI _must_ like him all the better for it: it stands to reason I must.\r\nI'll be shot if I should, though! and I don't much think I could ever\r\nforgive him.\"\r\n\r\nPercival found that the debt was a small one, and calculated that by a\r\nmiracle of economy he might pay it out of his salary at the end of the\r\nweek. Consequently, he dined out two or three days: at least he did not\r\ndine at home; but his dissipation did not seem to agree with him, for he\r\nlooked white and tired. Luckily, he had not to pay for his lodgings till\r\nMrs. Bryant came back, and he sincerely hoped that the good lady would\r\nbe happy with her sister, Mrs. Smith, till his finances were in better\r\norder. When he got his money he lost no time in settling Mr. Robinson's\r\nlittle account, and was fortunate enough to intercept another, about\r\nwhich Mr. Brett the tailor was growing seriously uneasy. He would not\r\nfor the world have parted with the precious document, but he began to\r\nwonder how he should extricate himself from his growing embarrassments.\r\nLydia--half suspicious, half laughing--made a remark about his\r\ncontinual absence from home. \"You are getting to be very gay, ain't you,\r\nMr. Thorne?\" she said; and she pulled her curl with her old liveliness,\r\nand watched him while she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, rather so: it does seem like it,\" he allowed.\r\n\r\n\"I think you'll be getting too fine for Bellevue street,\" said the girl:\r\n\"I'm afraid we ain't scarcely smart enough for you already.\"\r\n\r\nHad she any idea how much he was in their power? Was this a taunt or a\r\nchance shot?\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, I think not,\" he said. \"You see, Miss Bryant, I'm used to\r\nBellevue street now. By the way, I shall dine out again to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! again to-morrow?\" Lydia compressed her lips and looked at him.\r\n\"Oh, very well: it is a fine thing to have friends make so much of one,\"\r\nshe said as she turned to leave the room.\r\n\r\nPercival came home late the next evening. As he passed Judith's\r\nsitting-room the door stood wide and revealed its desolate emptiness.\r\nWas she gone, absolutely gone? And he had been out and had never had a\r\nword of farewell from her! Perhaps she had looked for him in the middle\r\nof the day and wondered why he did not come. Down stairs he heard Lydia\r\ncalling to the girl: \"Emma, didn't I tell you to put the 'Lodgings' card\r\nup in the windows as soon as Miss Lisle was out of the house? It might\r\njust as well have been up before. What d'ye mean by leaving it lying\r\nhere on the table? You're enough to provoke a saint--that you are! How\r\nd'ye know a score of people mayn't have been looking for lodgings\r\nto-day, and I dare say there won't be one to-morrow. If ever there was a\r\nlazy, good-for-nothing--\" The violent slamming of the kitchen-door cut\r\noff the remainder of the discourse, but a shrill screaming voice might\r\nstill be heard. Percival was certain that the tide of eloquence flowed\r\non undiminished, though of articulate words he could distinguish none.\r\nIt is to be feared that Emma was less fortunate.\r\n\r\nIt was true, then. Judith was gone, and that without a farewell look or\r\ntouch of the hand to mark the day! They had lived for months under the\r\nsame roof, and, though days might pass without granting them a glimpse\r\nof each other, the possibility of a meeting was continually with them.\r\nIt was only that night that Percival, sitting by his cheerless fireside,\r\nunderstood what that possibility had been to him. He consoled himself as\r\nwell as he could for his ignorance of the hour of Judith's departure by\r\nreflecting that Lydia would have followed her about with malicious\r\nwatchfulness, and would either have played the spy at their interview or\r\ninvented a parting instead of that which she had not seen. \"She can't\r\ngossip now,\" thought Percival.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lydia perceived, beyond a doubt, that they must have arranged\r\nsome way of meeting, since they had not taken the trouble to say\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n  [TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARVESTING-ANTS OF FLORIDA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXCAVATING AN ANT-HILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the low pine barrens of Florida are large districts thickly dotted\r\nover with small mounds made by a species of ant whose habits are unknown\r\nto the scientific world. Each mound is surrounded by a circle of small\r\nchips and pieces of charcoal, which the busy inhabitants often bring\r\nfrom a long distance. The hills are regular in outline, with a\r\ncrater-like depression on the summit, in the centre of which is the\r\ngateway or entrance.\r\n\r\nThese ants do not live in vast communities like the mound-builders of\r\nthe North, but each hill seems to be a republic by itself, though\r\nseparate colonies in the same neighborhood have friendly relations with\r\neach other. Their color is rufous or reddish-brown, and they are\r\nfurnished with stings like bees and wasps, and, like the honey-bee,\r\nalways die after inflicting a wound, for their stings are torn from\r\ntheir bodies and left in the victim. The pain inflicted is about the\r\nsame as that caused by the sting of the honey-bee. But they are not as\r\nvicious as most stinging insects: they will submit to considerable rough\r\ntreatment before resorting to this last resource.\r\n\r\nThere are three sets of neuters in each colony--major and minor workers\r\nand soldiers: also one wingless queen is found in each nest. The head is\r\nvery large, especially that of the soldier.[1] The workers minor--which\r\nare the true workers--have regular well-defined teeth on the mandibles,\r\nwhile most of the soldiers have merely the rudiments or teeth entirely\r\nobsolete. All the queens which I have found--eighteen in number--have\r\nperfectly smooth mandibles, without the least vestige of a tooth.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1877, I brought a large colony of these ants from one\r\nof the hills, including the workers major and minor and soldiers, and\r\nestablished them in a glass jar which I placed in my study. They very\r\nsoon commenced work, tunnelling the earth and erecting a formicary, as\r\nnearly as they could after the pattern of their home on the barrens. The\r\nmining was done entirely by the small workers. At first they refused all\r\nanimal food, but ate greedily fruit and sugar, and all kinds of seeds\r\nwhich I gave them were immediately taken below, out of sight. I now\r\nvisited the mounds on the barrens and found abundant indications of\r\ntheir food-supplies. At the base of each mound was a heap of chaff and\r\nshells of various kinds of seeds. The chaff was _Aristida speciformis_,\r\nwhich grew plentifully all about. I also found many seeds of _Euphorbia_\r\nand _Croton_, and several species of leguminous seeds. But the ants were\r\nnot bringing seeds in at this time of year: they were only carrying out\r\nthe discarded seeds and chaff; and only on the warmest days were they\r\nvery active. But they do not wholly hibernate. Even after a frosty\r\nnight, by ten o'clock in the morning many of the hills would be quite\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIER.]\r\n\r\nI sent specimens to the Rev. Dr. McCook of Philadelphia to be named, and\r\nhe identified them as _Pogono myrmex crudelis_, described by Smith as\r\n_Atta crudelis_[2] Dr. McCook predicted from their close structural\r\nresemblance to the Texan \"agricultural ant\" that they would prove to be\r\nharvesting-ants.\r\n\r\nOn excavating a nest I found chambers or store-rooms filled with various\r\nkinds of seeds. But, so far as I have observed, the seeds are not eaten\r\nuntil they are swollen or sprouted, when the outer covering bursts of\r\nitself. At this stage the starch is being converted into sugar, and this\r\nseems to be what the ants are after. They also seemed to be very fond of\r\nthe yellow pollen-dust of the pine. The catkins of the long-leaved pine\r\n(_Pinus australis_) commenced falling in February, and I noticed ants\r\ncongregated on them; so I took those just ready to discharge the pollen,\r\nand shook the dust on the mound in little heaps, which were soon\r\nsurrounded by ants, crowding and jostling each other in their eagerness\r\nto obtain a share.\r\n\r\nThe colony in the glass jar seemed perfectly contented, not trying to\r\nmake their escape at all. The earth was originally a little more than\r\ntwo inches in depth, but by the first of February these wonderful\r\narchitects had reared their domicile to the height of six inches. They\r\nraised tier upon tier of chambers in so substantial a manner that they\r\nnever fell in. One of the store-rooms in which they deposited the seeds\r\nI gave them was at the bottom of the jar, and the seeds were stored\r\nagainst the glass with no intervening earth between: it contained about\r\na teaspoonful of millet. I gave this chamber the right degree of heat\r\nand moisture to sprout the seed by pouring a little water down the side\r\nof the jar until it penetrated the chamber, and then setting it near the\r\nfire. The ants soon appreciated the condition of this store-room, and\r\nmany congregated there and seemed to be enjoying a feast. The next day\r\nthe seeds were all brought to the surface and deposited in a little heap\r\non one side of the jar, where many of them grew, making a pretty little\r\ngreen forest, which the ants soon cut down and destroyed. This chamber\r\nremained empty for three or four days, and was then again refilled with\r\nfresh millet and apple and croton seeds.\r\n\r\nI kept a small shell, which held about a tablespoonful of water,\r\nstanding in the jar for the ants to drink from. For more than a month\r\nthe water was allowed to remain clear, the ants often coming to the edge\r\nto drink; but one day one was walking on the edge of the shell, and\r\ncarrying an apple-seed, when she lost her footing and rolled into the\r\nwater. She floundered about for a few moments, still holding on to the\r\nseed: at last she let it drop and crawled out. As soon as she had\r\ndivested herself of the surplus water, she consulted several of her\r\ncompanions, and they immediately went to work and filled up the shell,\r\nfirst throwing in four or five apple-seeds, and then filling in with\r\nearth; and ever after, as often as I cleared out the shell and put in\r\nfresh water, it would be filled with earth, sticks and seeds; and they\r\nnow served all sweet liquids which I gave them in the same way, sipping\r\nthe syrup from the moistened earth.\r\n\r\nLike other ants, they are very fastidious about removing their dead\r\ncompanions. I buried one about half an inch beneath the soil. Very soon\r\nseveral congregated about the spot and commenced digging with their fore\r\nfeet, after the manner of digger-wasps, throwing the earth backward.\r\nThey soon unearthed and pulled the body out, when one seized and tried\r\nto remove it, climbing up the side of the jar, and falling back until I\r\nrelieved her of the burden.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I add new recruits of soldiers and workers to the jar.\r\nThis always causes a little confusion for a few moments: there is a\r\nquick challenging with antennae, but no fighting, and soon all are\r\nworking harmoniously together. I found three half-drowned, chilled ants\r\nnear the mound from which most of the inhabitants of the jar were taken.\r\nOne was not only wet and chilled, but also covered with sand. These I\r\nput on a small leaf and placed in the centre of the jar. The genial\r\nwarmth soon revived them. Many of their old companions clustered around\r\nthem, and there seemed to be considerable consultation. The two wet ants\r\nwere soon made welcome, and, leaving the leaf, were conducted by their\r\ncomrades--from whom they had been separated for more than two\r\nmonths--to the rooms below. But the one covered with sand--a major--did\r\nnot meet with so kindly a reception. She still remained on the leaf\r\ntrying to cleanse herself. All the ants had left her save one, who was\r\ndetermined to quarrel with her. I removed this one, and now another came\r\nup, bit at her and annoyed her until I removed this one also. Then some\r\nhalf dozen congregated about the leaf, touching her with their antennae\r\nand walking round her. By this time she was nearly free from the sand,\r\nand was looking quite bright, strutting about the leaf in a threatening\r\nattitude, with her mandibles wide apart. She was not attacked by these\r\nlast inspectors, though still looked upon a little suspiciously. I then\r\nreturned the two quarrelsome ants: they immediately walked up to their\r\nunfortunate comrade, and now seemed to be satisfied that she was a\r\nrespectable ant, and admitted her into the community with no further\r\nchallenging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1. WORKER MAJOR.\r\n2. OUTLINE OF HEAD OF WORKER MAJOR.\r\n3. OUTLINE OF BODY OF WORKER MINOR.]\r\n\r\nI found a nest of large carpenter-ants (_Camponotus atriceps_, var.\r\n_esuriens_, Smith) which had made their home in fallen timber. Upon\r\nexamining their work, it was evident they must have strong tools to work\r\nwith, for the numerous rooms and chambers of their domicile were often\r\nmade in firm, hard wood. They are the largest, most vicious species I\r\nhave ever seen. I introduced one of these terrible creatures into the\r\njar among the quiet, peaceful occupants. A large worker major\r\nimmediately closed with her: it was so quickly done that I could not\r\ntell which was the attacking party. They rolled about a few moments in a\r\nclose embrace, till they rolled out of sight through the wide entrance\r\nto one of the rooms below. There was considerable excitement and\r\nincreased activity among the workers, who were constantly bringing to\r\nthe surface bits of earth which the struggling warriors had loosened. In\r\nabout an hour the head of the carpenter was brought out, divested of\r\nevery member: both the antennae and palpi were gone, cut close to the\r\nhead. A little later the abdomen was brought out, and still later the\r\nthorax with not an entire leg left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN: SIDE-VIEW, SHOWING PECULIAR CONFORMATION OF THE\r\nTHORAX.]\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the months of January and February I introduced\r\ninto the jar a number of half-grown larvae of the harvester. Without any\r\nhesitation they were quickly carried to the rooms below by the workers\r\nminor. On the 4th of February I found a large number of the larvae of the\r\ncarpenter-ant (_Camponotus meleus_, Say). They were very small, and\r\nclosely packed together in a chamber cut out of hard wood, two inches in\r\nlength and an inch and a quarter in diameter, nearly circular. It was\r\npacked full of larvae and eggs, the larvae apparently just hatched. I\r\ndetached a small mass, all stuck together, and placed them in the jar\r\nwith the harvesters. The workers minor immediately surrounded the mass,\r\ntouching it with their antennae, and then retreated backward, passing\r\ntheir fore legs over the head and antennae, as if the larvae were\r\nobnoxious to them. Great commotion ensued, followed by an apparent\r\nconsultation lasting a few moments; but soon the usual quietness\r\nreigned, and most of the ants left the helpless larvae and returned to\r\ntheir mining and to the storing away of seeds or feeding their own\r\nyoung. But two or three had not entirely deserted the young carpenters.\r\nAgain and again they touched them, and then retreated, cleansing the\r\nantennae as they moved backward. At last one seized the mass and held it\r\nin her mandibles, standing nearly in an upright position. Several\r\nworkers now surrounded her, picked the larvae off, one by one, and\r\ncarried them below, until all were separated and disposed of.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most satisfactory way of studying the ants is in their\r\nnative haunts on the barrens, where I had ten nests under observation.\r\nOne of these was so situated that it received the direct rays of the sun\r\nall day, and was protected from north and east winds by dense, low\r\nshrubbery. On sunny days, even with a cool wind from the north, when\r\ntaking my seat in this sheltered spot, I would soon become uncomfortably\r\nwarm. This hill was always active whenever I visited it, while in other\r\nlocalities the ants would often be all housed. Around this active nest I\r\nstuck stems of millet eighteen inches high, surmounted by the\r\nclose-packed heads. The ants climbed the stems, loosened and secured the\r\nseeds, and stored them within the nest. They worked vigorously,\r\nsometimes twenty or more on one head pulling away at the seeds. In my\r\nartificial formicary they did not mount the stems, even when the heads\r\nwere not more than three or four inches from the ground, but seeds that\r\nI scattered in the jar were always taken below.\r\n\r\nI threw down a handful of apple-seeds near the entrance of the active\r\nhill on the barrens. This immediately attracted a large number of\r\nexcited ants. They rushed to the seeds in a warlike attitude, and began\r\ncarrying them off, depositing them two or three feet away. But as soon\r\nas the excitement caused by the sudden pouring down of the seeds had\r\nsubsided, they seemed to comprehend that they had been throwing away\r\ngood seeds; and now, changing their tactics, not only carried the\r\nremainder into the nest, but finally brought back and stored all those\r\nthat had been thrown away.\r\n\r\nOn excavating the nests we found granaries of seed scattered irregularly\r\nthroughout to the depth of twenty-two inches below the surface of the\r\nground: some were near the surface, and a few sprouted seeds were\r\nscattered about in the mound. The mound is usually not more than four to\r\nsix inches above the level of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of nests that I have found are in the low pine\r\nbarrens--so low that on reaching the depth of two feet the water runs\r\ninto the cavity like a spring, and stands above some of the granaries.\r\nNotwithstanding this wet locality, I found no sprouted seeds in the\r\ndeeper store-rooms, but only in the warmer mound. On sunny days the\r\nlarvae are brought up into the mound and deposited in chambers near the\r\nsurface, where they receive the benefit of the sun's rays. On cool,\r\ncloudy days and in the early morning I found no larvae near the surface.\r\nIf the ants are intelligent enough to treat the larvae in this way, why\r\nshould they not store seeds where they will not sprout? And when they\r\nneed to sprout them in order to obtain the sugar they contain, it would\r\ntake no more wisdom to treat the seed as they do the larvae--bringing\r\nthem near the surface to obtain the right degree of heat for the\r\nrequired result.\r\n\r\nThe little workers seem very determined not to allow any green thing to\r\ngrow on their mounds. Cassia and croton and many other plants start to\r\ngrow from seeds which the ants have dropped, but they are always cut\r\ndown and destroyed if too near the mound, though allowed to grow at a\r\nlittle distance; so that a botanist would be astonished at the great\r\nvariety of plants within a small area if not aware of the source from\r\nwhich they came. I sometimes found small shrubs of _Kalmia hirsuta_ and\r\n_Hypericums_ entirely dead on the mounds, the roots completely girdled\r\nin many places. It is very amusing to watch them in their efforts to\r\ndestroy grass and other plants. Their determined persistence is\r\nremarkable: they cut off the tender blades and throw them away. But they\r\ndo not stop here: the roots must be exterminated; so several dig around\r\nthe plant, throwing the earth backward, and after making it bare they\r\ncut and girdle the roots until the plant is killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. With well-formed teeth. 2. Partially developed. 3.\r\nEntirely obsolete.\r\n\r\nMANDIBLES OF THE HARVESTING-ANT.]\r\n\r\nEarly in March the ants in the jar seemed to have completed their\r\ndomicile. At first, several chambers were visible through the glass, and\r\nthe galleries leading to them, but gradually the light was all shut out\r\nby placing little particles of earth against the glass, thus depriving\r\nme of the opportunity of watching their movements within the nest. So I\r\nnow took the jar to the barrens, and set it by the side of a nest which\r\nwas about a mile distant from where most of the ants were obtained. Here\r\nI carefully broke it, and took the thin shell of glass from around the\r\nnest, which did not fall, but stood six inches in height and eighteen\r\ninches in circumference. With a large knife I removed a thin layer of\r\nearth, which revealed three admirable chambers with galleries leading\r\nfrom one to the other. Immediately below there were five chambers well\r\nfilled with ants, and below these other chambers were scattered\r\nirregularly throughout, with only thin partitions between.\r\n\r\nAt various times I had given the ants moistened sugar on the thick\r\ncurved leaves of the live-oak, and several of these had been covered\r\nwhile the ants were making their excavations. Two of the leaves were\r\nthree inches below the surface, and the ants had utilized them by making\r\nthe inner curved surface answer for the floor and sides of fine\r\nchambers; and here a large number of ants, both soldiers and workers,\r\nwere crowded together. In other chambers I found the larvae, which were\r\ngreatly increased in size since I had placed them in the jar; and the\r\nlarvae of the carpenter-ant were being reared, as I found some smaller\r\nthan any I had introduced belonging to the harvester.\r\n\r\nVery soon a great crowd of excited ants came from the hill near which I\r\nhad broken the jar, and began to transport the larvae, and also the\r\nmature ants, to their own dominions. There was no fighting: the ants\r\nfrom the jar submitted to being carried, not offering the least\r\nresistance. A small worker would often take hold of a large soldier,\r\nsometimes pushing, sometimes dragging, her through the sand, and she\r\nwould be as quiet as if dead or dying; but if we touch the little worker\r\nshe leaves her burden and rushes about to see what the interference\r\nmeans; and now the soldier straightens up, as bright and lively as the\r\nrest, and after passing her fore legs over her head and body, goes of\r\nher own accord into the new nest, meeting with no opposition. Some of\r\nthe ants would coil up and allow themselves to be carried easily. Others\r\nwere led along by an antenna or a leg, in either case manifesting no\r\nresistance. For three hours I watched the proceeding, and could see no\r\nfighting. It looked precisely as if the inhabitants of the jar realized\r\ntheir helpless condition, and gladly submitted to be taken prisoners or\r\nto become partners with this new firm.\r\n\r\nI left them, and after the lapse of two hours again visited the spot.\r\nThe seeds that had been in the jar were now being transferred to the\r\nother nest, and two new entrances at the base of the mound were being\r\nmade. And now every little while an ant would be ejected from the nest.\r\nOne worker would bring another out and lay her down, often not more than\r\nthree inches away from the door, but, so far as I could see, she was in\r\nno wise injured. Her first movement was to make herself presentable by\r\npassing her fore legs over her head and body: as soon as this was\r\ncompleted she returned within the nest. But there was one large soldier\r\nwhich the whole community seemed combined against. She was led or\r\ndragged away from the entrance of the nest eight times, and each time\r\nleft at the base of the mound among the rubbish. Sometimes she was led\r\nor carried by one alone, sometimes two or three would conduct her, and\r\nthen leave her, when she would at once proceed to make her toilet; which\r\ncompleted, she would again return to the door of the nest, when she\r\nwould be again conducted away, offering no resistance. I now picked her\r\nup, which made her very fierce. She seized my glove with her powerful\r\nmandibles, and held on with a persistency equal to the most vicious\r\nspecies, at the same time trying to use her sting. As soon as I could\r\nfree her from the glove I secured her, and on reaching home placed her\r\nunder the microscope, and found she was not injured and had strong teeth\r\nin her mandibles.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I returned her to the nest, and again she was met by the\r\nindignant police at the door and conducted away. With her strong\r\nmandibles she could have crushed any number of her small assailants, but\r\nin no instance did she show the least disposition to rebel against the\r\nindignities to which she was subjected. She was often dragged away with\r\nher back on the ground and her legs coiled up, apparently helpless. If\r\nall the soldiers had been treated in this way, it would not have been so\r\nremarkable, but so far as I could see the rest were allowed to remain,\r\ngoing in and out of the nest as if taking a survey of their new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nFor five months I had these ants under almost constant observation, and\r\nyet I was unable to make out the true position of the soldiers in the\r\ncolony. They stay mostly within the nest. On the warmest days a few\r\nwill come out and walk leisurely around the mound. They are not\r\nscattered irregularly through the nest, but seem to be housed together\r\nin large chambers. In one of these chambers I found a wingless queen in\r\ntheir midst. It seemed very fitting for a queen to be surrounded by\r\nAmazon soldiers; but, alas! they seemed more like maids of honor than\r\nsoldiers, for they forsook the royal lady without making an effort to\r\ndefend her. Not so, however, with the little workers: they rallied\r\naround her, ready to guard her with their lives, and no doubt would have\r\nsucceeded had it been any ordinary foe.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon--the soldiers and queens with smooth mandibles--is very\r\npuzzling, and has excited much interest among naturalists both in this\r\ncountry and in Europe. I sent specimens to Mr. Charles Darwin, which he\r\nforwarded to Mr. Frederick Smith of the British Museum (who, Mr. Darwin\r\ninforms me, is the highest authority in Europe on ants and other\r\nHymenoptera). Mr. Smith says: \"Your observations on the structural\r\ndifferences in the mandibles of this ant are quite new to me.\" I also\r\nsent specimens to the eminent naturalist Dr. Auguste Forel of Munich,\r\nwho, like Mr. Smith, had never observed this feature of the mandibles in\r\nany ant; but he has a theory to account for it--that the smooth\r\nmandibles have been worn down by labor. If this theory is true, how can\r\nwe account for the fact that other ants do not wear down their teeth?\r\nThe chitinous covering of this harvesting-ant is firm and hard. The\r\nstage forceps of my microscope closes with a spring, and in studying\r\nthis ant I have put thousands of individuals to the test, holding them\r\nin the forceps to examine their mandibles, and in no instance do I\r\nrecollect seeing one injured, while many other species are easily\r\ninjured by the forceps. Among these are the two large species of\r\ncarpenter-ant before mentioned, which work in stumps or fallen timber.\r\nThese ants all have well-developed teeth, and the shell-like covering\r\nenveloping the body is much thinner than that of the harvesting-ant.\r\n\r\nIf it be urged that hard wood will not wear down the teeth like mining\r\nin the sandy soil, I can bring forward another member of this family\r\n(_Camponotus socius_, Roger), which lives in the ground, and whose\r\nmining and tunnelling are on a much more extensive scale than those of\r\nthe harvesting-ant. The formicary of this _Camponotus_ often extends\r\nover several square rods, with large entrances at various points, all\r\nconnected by underground galleries, requiring a great amount of labor to\r\nconstruct them; while each colony of the harvesting-ant has a close,\r\ncompact nest or formicary, requiring much less work to construct it. The\r\nworker major of _Camponotus socius_ is very large--larger than the\r\nsoldier of the harvesting-ant. The formicaries of the two species are\r\noften in close contact, so that the nature of the soil is precisely the\r\nsame. I have examined thousands of _Camponotus socius_, and in no\r\ninstance have I found the teeth worn down.\r\n\r\nThere is still another difficulty in the way of Dr. Forel's theory.\r\nCareful observations have revealed the fact that all the harvesting-ants\r\nthat engage in work of any kind are armed with teeth. I took thirty\r\nsoldiers with smooth mandibles, put them in a glass jar with every\r\nfacility for making a nest, but they refused to work, scorned all my\r\noffers of food, and remained huddled together for three days. I then\r\nintroduced several workers minor, and they immediately commenced\r\ntunnelling the earth and making chambers, into which the lazy soldiers\r\ncrawled, meeting with no opposition from these industrious little\r\ncreatures. My experiments did not stop here. I now took about a hundred\r\nspecimens--soldiers and a few workers major, the last with\r\npartially-developed teeth--and placed them in a jar. Some of these made\r\nfeeble attempts to construct a nest, but they did not store away seeds,\r\nand larvae which I put in the jar they carried about as if not knowing\r\nwhat to do with them.\r\n\r\nThere is every appearance of an aristocracy among these humble\r\ncreatures. The minors are the servants who do the work, while the queens\r\nand soldiers (especially the soldiers, which more nearly approach the\r\nqueen in shape of head and mandibles) seem to live a life of comparative\r\nease, and have their food brought to them by the minors. This may be the\r\nreason of the non-development of the teeth among the aristocracy. But\r\nhow the same parent can produce such differing offspring--some born to a\r\nlife of ease, with obsolete teeth, and others with well-developed teeth\r\nto do the work--is one of the mysteries in Nature. The only way to\r\nsettle the point with regard to the mandibles beyond dispute is to find\r\nthe pupae of very young queens and soldiers, which I was unable to do\r\nduring my stay in Florida. All the young were in the larval state.\r\n\r\n  MARY TREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTEUR ALPHEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Marcelline! Marcelline! viens m'aider: je souffre!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was thin and querulous, but painfully weak, and the stalwart,\r\nbroad-shouldered negress to whom the cry was addressed had an anxious,\r\nstartled look on her usually stolid face as she turned away from the\r\nopen door and went into the sick room.\r\n\r\n\"My poor mistress,\" she said tenderly in French, raising in her arms as\r\nshe spoke the attenuated form of the suffering woman before her and\r\nrearranging her pillows, \"you feel very bad to-day: I knew you did just\r\nnow when you were asleep and I heard you groaning. I wish--_bon\r\nDieu!_--I wish I could do something for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe invalid made no reply for a minute, but gazed piteously up into the\r\nother's face. She was a woman of about fifty, who even in the last\r\nstages of emaciation and weakness showed traces of wonderful beauty. The\r\nsharp, drawn features were as clear and fine as those of a model, and\r\neven now the sweetness and brilliancy of her dark-blue eyes were little\r\ndiminished. But pain of some kind and utter prostration held her in\r\ntheir grip, and she made several attempts to speak before she said, in a\r\nhoarse whisper, \"Thou canst help me, child. Food, Marcelline! food, for\r\nthe love of God!\"\r\n\r\nThe negress started, knit her brows and murmured anxiously, \"Oh, my dear\r\nmistress, anything but that! Think what would happen to me and my\r\nchildren if--if--\"--she seemed almost afraid even to whisper the name,\r\nbut sank her voice to the lowest tone as she continued--\"if Mons.\r\nAlphege were to find me out. _Attends!_\" she added aloud and coaxingly:\r\n\"it will soon be time for your supper now: when the bell rings you are\r\nto have some milk, and the sun is almost down.\"\r\n\r\nThe sick woman groaned and lay quite still, but when, in a few minutes,\r\na clanging plantation-bell rang the joyful announcement that the day's\r\nwork was over, she grasped the milk which Marcelline brought her like\r\none famished, and drained it without breathing. It was a short draught,\r\nafter all, for the cup was only half full, but Marcelline turned away\r\nwith a shiver from the imploring eyes and outstretched hands, which\r\nasked her to replenish it, and, as though unable to endure the sight of\r\nsuffering which she could not alleviate, went out upon the open gallery\r\nand sat down on the steps.\r\n\r\nThe room was on the ground floor, and the house was an old-fashioned\r\ncreole dwelling, long and low, with many doors and innumerable little\r\nstaircases--everything in disorder and out of repair, and weeds and\r\ngrass growing up to the threshold. There was a well-stocked and\r\ncarefully-tended vegetable garden not a hundred yards off: the\r\npoultry-yards, dove-cotes and smoke-houses were as full as they could\r\nhold, and over yonder, just behind the tall picket fence, were\r\ncorn-cribs bursting with corn and hay-lofts choked with hay. Fifty or\r\nsixty negro hovels, irregularly grouped together down by the bayou-side,\r\nand indistinctly seen in the fading twilight, contained about three\r\nhundred slaves, who, having trooped in from the field at the sound of\r\nthe bell, were now eating pork and hominy as fast as they could swallow.\r\nBut no one would have guessed that all this abundance was at hand, or\r\nthat this was the homestead of one of the richest creole families in the\r\nState. Yet it was so. Old Madame Levassour--or Madame Hypolite, as she\r\nwas invariably called--was not only the widow of a wealthy planter, but\r\nhad been herself a great heiress, perhaps the greatest in the whole\r\nSouth, at the time of her marriage. The property had gone on\r\nappreciating, as slave property did in old times, and now that she was\r\nlying at the point of death, her two daughters, who had married\r\nbrothers, and, like all true creoles, still lived at home with their\r\nmother, would soon be enormously rich. They were well off already by\r\ninheritance from their father, and each owned a valuable plantation and\r\nmany slaves; but these were nothing compared to the possessions of their\r\nmother, who was an excellent business-woman, full of energy, prudence\r\nand moderation, and never weak or capricious, especially where the\r\ninterests of others were concerned. She had always been a kind and\r\nindulgent mistress to her slaves, who loved her in return with\r\npassionate fidelity, and many were the sighs and tears their approaching\r\nchange of owners produced among them. Her sons-in-law were educated men,\r\nof good birth and moderate fortune; but negroes are the best judges of\r\ncharacter in the world, and there was not a trait or feeling concealed\r\nunder the quiet, nonchalant exterior of Mons. Volmont Cherbuliez which\r\nthey did not thoroughly understand. About his brother Alphege, who was a\r\nphysician, there was more diversity of opinion. That he also was bad,\r\ncruel, dissipated, profoundly deceitful, there was no doubt in the minds\r\nof his future chattels, but what precise form his idiosyncrasies would\r\ntake they felt to be uncertain, and gazed with terror--all the more\r\nacute for being somewhat vague--at his cold, impassive face. In the mean\r\ntime, nothing could be more irreproachable than the demeanor of the two\r\nbrothers. Dr. Alphege was known to be a man of great skill, a graduate\r\nof the medical schools of Paris and always interested in the practice of\r\nhis profession. He devoted himself to his mother-in-law now with\r\nunfailing assiduity, and when her disease--which he pronounced to be a\r\ndangerous gastric affection--baffled his utmost efforts, he sent for\r\nadvice and assistance even to New Orleans; which, thirty years ago in\r\nSouth-western Louisiana, was quite an enterprise. His fellow-physicians\r\nagreed with him in his management of the case, and the daughters and\r\nfriends of Madame Hypolite, though deeply grieved by her illness, felt\r\nthat nothing more could be done. As is usual in diseases of the stomach,\r\nher suffering was very great, and the most rigid care had to be\r\nexercised in the choice and administration of nourishment. On her food,\r\nsaid Dr. Alphege, he depended for the only hope of a cure: consequently,\r\nthe rules which he laid down must be, and were, enforced in the most\r\nrigid manner. The penalty of transgressing his orders was always severe,\r\nbut now the fiat went forth that any one of the nurses or attendants\r\nupon Madame Hypolite who should depart from his carefully-explained\r\norders in the minutest particular should receive a punishment such as\r\nhad never been administered in that household before.\r\n\r\nOne of the marked features of creole life was always the immense number\r\nof house-servants, and in a long illness such as Madame Hypolite was now\r\nexperiencing many attendants and various nurses seemed a matter of\r\ncourse. Therefore the doctor's orders were doubly necessary, and would\r\nin all cases have been entirely correct, since the first element of good\r\nnursing is implicit obedience. Still, with all this care, she did not\r\nimprove, and in the evening of which we write her two daughters,\r\nMesdames Volmont and Alphege (for a creole never gets his or her last\r\nname except in legal documents), were sitting on the gallery not far\r\nfrom where Marcelline crouched on the steps, rocking themselves backward\r\nand forward to keep off the mosquitoes and talking over the aspect of\r\naffairs. They were both extremely pretty women, and very much alike.\r\nEuphrosyne (Madame Volmont) was a year or two the older, but still not\r\nmore than twenty-two or three. She had been married at fourteen, and her\r\noldest boy was nearly eight, but she seemed not more than sixteen now;\r\nwhile Clothilde (Madame Alphege), who, although married at the same age,\r\nwas childless, looked even younger; and any stranger seeing them this\r\nevening in their soft white cambric dresses, little high-heeled red\r\nslippers and floating ribbons, would have taken them for a couple of\r\npretty, dark-eyed, lazy school-girls enjoying their holiday.\r\n\r\nMarcelline listened to them as they talked, at first with the same\r\nintent, peculiar expression she had worn in the sick room, but gradually\r\nher features relaxed as she heard their harmless chatter, subdued so as\r\nnot to disturb the sufferer near by, but full of little childish gossip\r\nand kindly details of daily life. After talking for a few minutes about\r\nDr. Alphege's last report, which was that some slight improvement was\r\nvisible, Clothilde asked her sister with much interest if she had\r\nfinished the novena she was making, and on being answered in the\r\naffirmative said that she would begin one herself on Monday.\r\n\r\n\"Bien!\" said Euphrosyne. \"If you will make a novena I will burn two more\r\ncandles, and get Pere Ramain to say three masses for my intention in\r\nhonor of the Blessed Trinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say the novena with me,\" suggested Clothilde, fanning and rocking, and\r\nspeaking less distinctly than usual because her mouth was full of candy.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I cannot,\" replied Euphrosyne: \"my knees are black and blue\r\nnow. I told Pere Ramain yesterday that if he could just see them he\r\nwould not make me kneel again for a week.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke a horse's step was heard on the grass, and Volmont\r\nCherbuliez galloped lightly up over the turf. As he jumped down and\r\nthrew the reins to half a dozen nearly naked little black fellows who\r\nwere at his heels, his wife rose to meet him affectionately, and with\r\nher hand on his shoulder said in a low tone of genuine delight, \"Cher\r\nami, you will be so glad to hear that mamma is really better to-night!\"\r\nShe was not looking at him, but even in the darkness, which was now that\r\nof a starlit summer evening, Marcelline could see the slight start and\r\nchange of expression with which he heard her. He said nothing, however,\r\nbut kissed her hand with as much gallantry as though he was still\r\n_faisant la cour_ to \"mademoiselle,\" and they all passed into the\r\ndining-room together. This, as was the custom in all such houses, was\r\nalso the common sitting-room of the family, or rather, when the weather\r\nwas too cold to sit on the galleries and they had occasion to leave\r\ntheir bedrooms, it was here they met. As a rule, the women invariably\r\noccupied their sleeping apartments, and never thought of leaving them\r\nexcept for the open gallery or at meal-times. Here they received their\r\nfriends, sewed, embroidered, gossiped and told their beads. Two large\r\ndouble beds were the ordinary complement of each room, and, what with\r\nlarge family connections and frequent visitors, it was rare indeed to\r\nfind one not in use. Owing to this habit on the part of the women, and\r\nthe fact that no Creole planter ever spent two consecutive minutes in\r\nhis house during the daytime if he could possibly help it, the\r\ndining-room was as dreary a spot as could be imagined. A long, narrow\r\ntable covered with oilcloth and surmounted by a huge punkah, a number of\r\nstraight wooden chairs and a square red cupboard comprised all the\r\nfurniture, the whole dimly lighted by two candles. The Cherbuliez\r\nfamily, however, as they sat down to supper, seemed to feel no\r\ndeficiency, and ate and drank merrily, especially when Madame Volmont's\r\nthree children came in and were bountifully helped to everything on the\r\ntable, including ripe figs, cucumbers, melons and gumbo _choux_. As they\r\nwere all lingering over the table and wondering why Alphege did not\r\ncome in, he suddenly appeared, looking very pale and tired. Without\r\nstopping even to say \"Good-evening,\" he passed directly through into the\r\nroom beyond, where Madame Hypolite was lying, and was heard questioning\r\nMarcelline rapidly as to his patient's condition. When he at last sat\r\ndown to his supper he looked like a man overworked bodily indeed, but\r\nwith a great weight suddenly removed from his mind; and Clothilde, who\r\nwas an _enfant gatee_ to him as to others, exclaimed joyfully, \"Oh,\r\nAlphege, maman is really better--elle va se guerir, elle est hors de\r\ndanger, n'est ce pas?\" And she came behind him and put her arms round\r\nhis neck as he tried to eat, and gave him a joyful embrace.\r\n\r\nWhatever the dark secrets of his soul might be, at which so many dimly\r\nguessed, Alphege Cherbuliez was invariably tender and considerate to his\r\nwife; and now, as he gently disengaged the little hands that were\r\nthrottling him from his throat, he said kindly, but with a gravity which\r\nalways awed and restrained her, \"I think she is better, my dear, but it\r\nis impossible to predict in such cases; and all we can do is to wait and\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his brother, who had lighted a cigarette and was sitting\r\nopposite with his youngest child on his knee, looked up. The gaze of the\r\ntwo men met. On the bronzed cheek of Volmont came a slight flush, and\r\nhis eyes had an expression for the moment of fear and appeal. But the\r\ndark, handsome face of Alphege maintained its cold, inscrutable\r\ncomposure, and the look before which his brother's slowly fell was\r\nmagnetic in its steady strength.\r\n\r\nA little later, as they smoked together on the steps their last cigar\r\nbefore retiring, Volmont asked in a sudden low whisper, \"Did you\r\nsucceed?\" and Alphege said slowly aloud, \"Yes: they will wait two weeks\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadst thou trouble, my brother?\"\r\n\r\nThe other paused a moment, and then said, \"Yes: they were inclined to\r\ninsist. They have been a long time out of their money, mon ami, and when\r\nthis danger is over we shall do well to avoid another--with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you promise?\" asked Volmont, as if reassured by his brother's\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"I promised,\" said Alphege, carefully rolling the end of his cigar, but\r\nthis time dropping his voice, \"that in a fortnight the notes should be\r\ntaken up.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was midnight, and the house was entirely silent and dark except where\r\none shaded candle burned in the sick room. Down at the \"quarters,\" as\r\nthe negro cabins were called, every one was literally locked in slumber,\r\nand it must have been a loud and prolonged noise which should have\r\nawakened those tired sleepers. But some one was stirring, for all that,\r\nand had the moon been shining ever so faintly it would have been a\r\ndangerous task for those two gliding, crouching figures to move across\r\nthe open green beyond the stable as they were doing. But the night was\r\nsafely dark: a soft gray scud from the Gulf was flying rapidly in,\r\nobscuring even the dim starlight, and no one saw them as they passed\r\nthrough the turngate in the fence and sat down close to the water's edge\r\nunder the overhanging trunk of a huge water-oak.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are safe,\" said the woman, throwing back her coarse shawl; \"and\r\nI tell you, Pierre, you must listen to me, and I _must_ speak, or some\r\nday I shall just burst out and go screaming my dreadful news from one\r\nend of the parish to the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Marcelline, and the man who listened to her a huge\r\nraw-boned mulatto of that square-jawed, vindictive-looking type which is\r\nthe manifest offspring of foul oppression and long-continued wrong.\r\n\r\nBut he shrank appalled from the tremendous energy of the woman beside\r\nhim. \"Hush--sh!\" he said in a warning whisper and with an apprehensive\r\nglance into the still darkness around. \"Don't talk so loud, you fool! or\r\nI'll choke the d----d black blood out of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman lowered her voice, but paid no other heed to his menace as\r\nshe went on in the same earnestly-excited manner. \"Listen, Pierre!\" she\r\nsaid, grasping him by the arm and speaking with an amount of decision\r\nwhich even he could not withstand. \"Do you love la bonne maitresse? Do\r\nyou care for her to live or die? Dis-moi, dis ce que tu veux!\"\r\n\r\nThe man answered slowly, as if the words were forced from him against\r\nhis will, but still with an accent of truth and a certain amount of\r\nenergy: \"Love her? Jesu! yes, I do love her. It seems drole for one of\r\nus to talk about loving these cursed whites, who treat us worse than\r\ndogs; but, for all that, I do love madame.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman almost shook him as she said in a whisper of concentrated\r\nfury, \"Who saved your life, Pierre Lambas, when you were perishing with\r\nsmallpox? Who went to New Orleans to buy your wife and children from a\r\ncruel master and bring them here to you? Who watched by Sophie when she\r\nwas in convulsions?\"\r\n\r\nHer voice broke and her fingers relaxed their hold, but this time Pierre\r\nanswered without hesitation: \"C'etait-elle, je le sais bien--I know it\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" pursued Marcelline, \"you are willing to stand by and see her\r\nslowly murdered, inch by inch, by this white-faced devil, who leans over\r\nher and professes to love her, but is killing her--_killing her_, Dieu\r\ndes dieux!--with hunger and thirst?\" Her voice shook so that she could\r\nscarcely speak as she concluded.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know,\" asked Pierre slowly, after a long pause, \"that what you\r\nthink about this may not be a mistake?\" Marcelline made an impatient\r\ngesture, but he went calmly on: \"They say Mons. Alphege is a good\r\ndoctor, and that he is fond of sa belle-mere. How can I take a man's\r\nlife on a mere suspicion?\"\r\n\r\nShe almost flew at him in her frenzy, but the darkness so shielded her\r\nthat he did not see the movement, which was as well. She controlled\r\nherself instantly, and only said in reply, \"Thou hast not been always so\r\ncareful of white life, mon ami--so unwilling to shed white blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bah!\" retorted he: \"that was when I could not be detected, and\r\nwhen more than life was in question. But now to kill this man would be\r\nto suffer death myself in the next hour, and to know that my wife and\r\nchildren were punished as well. Besides,\" he continued, as if trying to\r\nreason with her, \"you have told me nothing which convinces me that what\r\nyou say is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then,\" she said, raising her head, which had sunk upon her\r\nbreast. \"You do not believe that he is starving her to death: you think\r\nshe has all the food required by one in her weak and perishing\r\ncondition. You think her cries, her prayers, her agony of desire for\r\nnourishment--for nourishment!--are only the result of sickness, and that\r\nif she had it she could not eat. Bien! Every morning, when I go into her\r\nroom to dress her blisters with fresh poultices, I find the old ones\r\ntorn off and eaten up! Tell me, Pierre, have any of our kin, in their\r\nworst straits of hunger and suffering, done worse than that?\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a low voice, but it was freighted with such an intensity of\r\nhorror and misery that the man beside her could not speak for an\r\ninstant. When he did, he said in tones of the deepest feeling, \"Ma\r\npauvre maitresse! ma pauvre maitresse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you still refuse?\" hissed Marcelline.\r\n\r\nThe answer was compassionate, but resolved: \"I do, Marcelline. Not even\r\nfor her sake can I risk all. _You_ know I have nearly saved enough money\r\nto buy my freedom. Once free, I shall soon purchase Sophie and the young\r\nones: I cannot abandon such hopes even to save her.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence. \"May God help me, then!\" said the woman as\r\nshe rose, \"for I swear by the Blessed Sacrament to save her if she be\r\nstill alive--to revenge her if she be dead.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree days later a long funeral cortege passed from the gates of the\r\nLevassour plantation and took its way along the dusty road toward the\r\nCatholic church of the settlement, some three miles off. In and out\r\nbetween the massive green walls of shining Cherokee rose-vines, which\r\nformed impenetrable barriers on either side of the way, wound the long\r\nline of old-fashioned chariots with black coachmen in queer, antiquated\r\nliveries, preceded by the tawdry French hearse with its numerous gilt\r\ndevices and huge nodding plumes. The pitiless sun beat down upon them,\r\nand the blinding clouds of dust rose and choked them, but the mourners,\r\nboth black and white, who formed the procession--and it was closed by a\r\nthrong of weeping negroes on foot--were too much interested and absorbed\r\nin their melancholy task to feel either the one or the other, for such\r\nan occasion as this had never taken place in all that quiet country-side\r\nbefore. Inside of that hearse, in a snow-white coffin covered with\r\nflowers and gayly decorated with cut paper, silver crosses and waxen\r\nsaints, reposed the mortal remains of Madame Hypolite Levassour, who had\r\ndied at midnight thirty-six hours previously; and by her side in another\r\ncoffin, more hastily contrived, lay the body of her well-beloved\r\nson-in-law and physician, Docteur Alphege Cherbuliez, who within six\r\nhours after her death had been killed by a shot-gun in the hands of an\r\nunknown assassin. Two negro men, Gerard Grol and Pierre Lambas, had been\r\narrested on strong suspicion, and were now in close confinement awaiting\r\nthe trial which both knew would be short, sharp and swift, and\r\nadministered by a judge who would not wait for legal proceedings to\r\nassist or confirm his decisions. Circumstantial evidence was strong\r\nagainst them, and the two unfortunate wretches were not more conscious\r\nthat the sun was shining in heaven, making the narrow caboose in which\r\nthey had been confined an unendurable, suffocating den of heat, than\r\nthey were that when the dead were buried and grief was satisfied\r\nvengeance would make sudden and terrible work with them.\r\n\r\nWhen the church was reached the carriages drew up in double ranks around\r\nthe broad green meadow in which it stood, and the occupants, descending,\r\nfiled in motley array into the building. Just in front of the altar two\r\ntressels were prepared for the coffins, which were not brought in until\r\nthe whole congregation, which filled the pews to overflowing, was\r\nseated. Then the measured tramp of men was heard, and amid general\r\nweeping and lamentation the pall-bearers entered, and the priest,\r\nadvancing from the foot of the altar, sprinkled with holy water first\r\none coffin and then the other as they were placed before him, while the\r\nchoir chanted softly the \"De Profundis.\" Everything proceeded quietly as\r\nusual through the beautiful services for the burial of the dead, and the\r\ncool, dark church, with its mingled odor of incense and flowers, became\r\nmore and more quiet as the soothing influences crept over the hearts of\r\nthose assembled there. Mass was over, and the priest, coming out from\r\nthe chancel, knelt before the tall crucifix which stood at the foot of\r\nthe coffins and began the most touching of all prayers, \"Non intres in\r\njudicium,\" when a sudden movement was heard at the lower end of the\r\nchurch, a stifled cry of alarm instantly hushed, and in another moment\r\nMarcelline, who had followed the cortege, like the other servants, on\r\nfoot, walked slowly and with a perfectly composed and steady step up the\r\naisle, made her reverence to the Host which was concealed in the\r\ntabernacle before her, and then stood facing the priest, who without\r\npausing finished his prayer and rose from his knees.\r\n\r\n\"What wouldst thou have, my daughter,\" he asked with dignity, \"that thou\r\ndost disturb the holy services of the Church?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause. Marcelline seemed to steady herself: then\r\nputting her hand on the coffin of Alphege Cherbuliez, she said in a\r\nhigh, monotonous voice which rang through the building and reached even\r\nthe watchers on the green without, \"I killed Doctor Alphege Cherbuliez\r\nwith my own hands. No one helped me and no one saw me. You can turn\r\nPierre Lambas and Gerard Grol loose.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden stir like the rushing of a mighty wind through the\r\nchurch, but the priest waved his hand and the people were still.\r\n\r\n\"What was your motive?\" he asked without moving.\r\n\r\nThe woman had never turned her head, and now answered him in the same\r\noverstrained key: \"He starved my mistress to death. I saw her slowly\r\ndying of hunger and thirst day after day, and I made up my mind to kill\r\nhim as soon as I could get the chance. I had to wait and wait,\" she went\r\non, her voice sinking a little, \"till at last it was too late.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, suddenly stooped and kissed her mistress's coffin: then\r\nwheeling round and facing the congregation, who sat spellbound, she\r\nshook her clenched fist at them. \"Ah!\" she said, speaking in a terrible\r\nvoice, \"you knew, you must have known--friends and cousins and brothers,\r\nay, daughters too--that bread--_bread_!--was what she wanted. Who heard\r\nher cry for food? Who heard her beg and pray and implore for one little\r\nsip of milk, one little bite of meat?\" Her voice rose to a shriek as she\r\nwent on, but such was the force of her passion that no effort was made\r\nto check her: \"You, all of you--all heard, all saw, all knew, yet none\r\nhad courage to act; and now, c'est moi! c'est moi!\" striking her breast\r\nviolently with both hands, \"la pauvre esclave, qui l'ai vengee!\"\r\n\r\nShe paused: there was a dead silence. Instantly a ring of men closed\r\nround her: she was swept from the church, so swiftly was she borne away,\r\nand the service proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe priest looked pale, and sent two or three messages to those without,\r\nbut they were of no avail. Before he could leave the altar, which he did\r\nas hurriedly as possible, Marcelline was hanging from the limb of an oak\r\ntree within sight of the church, her last words being, \"God will forgive\r\nme: I did right.\" But bitter were the tears Pere Ramain shed when he\r\nfound she had gone to her last account unshriven and unabsolved.\r\n\r\n  ANNIE PORTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPHONIC STUDIES.\r\n\r\n(AFTER ROBERT SCHUMANN.)\r\n\r\nPRELUDE\r\n\r\n\r\n          Blue storm-clouds in hot heavens of mid-July\r\n            Hung heavy, brooding over land and sea:\r\n            Our hearts, a-tremble, throbbed in harmony\r\n          With the wild, restless tone of air and sky.\r\n          Shall we not call him Prospero who held\r\n            In his enchanted hands the fateful key\r\n            Of that tempestuous hour's mystery,\r\n          And with controlling wand our spirits spelled,\r\n          With him to wander by a sun-bright shore,\r\n            To hear fine, fairy voices, and to fly\r\n          With disembodied Ariel once more\r\n            Above earth's wrack and ruin?

Literature which is intended simply to amuse or entertain,\r\nincluding popular tales, beast-fables, anecdotes, riddles and\r\nburlesques. Second. Literature which grows out of, and afterward reacts\r\nupon, the popular love of glory, of war, of adventure and of heroism,\r\nincluding historical ballads, death-songs and the fiery orations of the\r\nmullahs. And third. Literature which serves merely as an outlet for the\r\nemotions. A fourth class might perhaps be made of the prayers,\r\nexhortations, pious traditions and edifying anecdotes of the theological\r\nschools and the mosques, but such productions are more or less alike\r\namong all Mohammedan peoples, and those current in the Caucasus are\r\ninteresting only as illustrations of a peculiar phase of Oriental\r\nmysticism--viz. the philosophy of the Murids.\r\n\r\nOf these three classes, that which includes anecdotes, beast-fables and\r\npopular tales is, although not the most original, by far the most varied\r\nand extensive, comprising as it does full four-fifths of the entire body\r\nof Caucasian traditionary lore. The popular tales already collected by\r\nthe officers of the Caucasian mountain administration at Tiflis would\r\nmake a volume of four or five hundred pages, and as yet the collectors\r\nhave hardly gone outside the limits of the single province of Daghestan.\r\nFor the most part, however, these stories are only variants of\r\nwell-known Aryan and Turanian originals, and are valuable chiefly for\r\ntheir local coloring and for the light which they throw upon the tastes,\r\nthe habits and the mental processes of a peculiar and long-isolated\r\npeople. Yet the fact that they are among the oldest heirlooms of the\r\nhuman race does not detract in the least from their value as indices to\r\ncharacter. On the contrary, it adds to it by linking them with the\r\nfolk-lore of the world, and enabling the student to compare them with\r\ntheir original types and understand and estimate aright the significance\r\nof the variations. Every one knows how a story is unconsciously varied,\r\ncolored and adapted in the course of repeated narration to accord with\r\nthe views, knowledge and tastes of its successive narrators, and how\r\ndifferently the same intellectual framework of fact or fancy will be\r\nfilled up by the imaginations of different races. This working-over\r\nprocess, which has been going on in the Caucasus without interference\r\nand without literary restraint for hundreds--perhaps thousands--of\r\nyears, has given to Caucasian stories a peculiar psychological interest\r\nwhich in their original forms they never could have had. The themes upon\r\nwhich they were originally founded are most of them perfectly familiar\r\nto every student of comparative folk-lore, but the modifications which\r\nthey have undergone, the changed forms in which they reappear, are all\r\nnew, and every such change or modification points to some peculiarity in\r\nthe character of the people who originated it. The variations of a\r\nstory, therefore, are so many \"Fraunhofer's lines\" which reveal to us\r\nthe nature of the intellectual medium through which it has passed. For\r\nthese reasons the stories, fables and songs which are herewith presented\r\nmust not be judged by their intrinsic value as literature alone, but by\r\nthe light which they throw upon the life, tastes, temperament and\r\nartistic methods of a semi-barbarous but naturally gifted people.\r\n\r\nThe space to which I am limited will enable me to give only one or two\r\nspecimens from each of the three classes into which I have for\r\nconvenience' sake divided Caucasian literature. I will begin with one of\r\nthe shortest of its popular tales, a humorous narrative entitled \"The\r\nHero Naznai.\" This story, in one form or another, is common to all\r\nbranches of the Aryan family, but the mountaineers have so modified and\r\nimproved it as to make it almost their own. It recites the adventures\r\nand achievements of a certain worthless coward who is made by the force\r\nof circumstances to appear a hero.\r\n\r\n_The Hero Naznai._--Listen! listen! There was and there was not. The fox\r\nlived with the hare in the fields, the bear lived with the wild-boar in\r\nthe forest, and in the land of Daghestan there lived a hero, a scurvy\r\nfellow without brains or bravery. When he should have been in front he\r\nwas behind; when he should have been behind he was in front; and if his\r\nwife only lifted the poker he hid himself behind the door. Oh, he was\r\nvery brave! He was called \"the hero Naznai.\" One night he went out of\r\ndoors to get a drink: it was bright moonlight. Beside him, with a\r\npitcher in her hand, stood his wife. Without his wife he never went out\r\nat night: he said, because he didn't like to leave her alone; she said,\r\nbecause he was afraid to go out of doors without her. \"What a beautiful\r\nnight!\" exclaimed Naznai--\"the very night for a raid.\"--\"Look out!\"\r\ncried his wife suddenly: \"there's a wolf.\" Naznai, trembling with fear,\r\nran and climbed up into a cart, almost breaking his neck in his haste.\r\nHis wife led him into the house and said, \"I am disgusted with your\r\ncowardice, and I am disgusted with you: leave my house this instant (the\r\nhouse belonged to her), or you shall never see another peaceful day:\r\nevery God-given day, morning and evening, I will pound you with the\r\npoker.\" Naznai begged her to let him stay until daybreak. She consented.\r\nIn the morning he slung his miserable old sabre over his shoulder and\r\nstarted. Walking and strolling along, he came to a place where some one\r\nhad been eating fruit, and where there had gathered a great swarm of\r\nflies. Picking up a big flat stone, he clapped it down on the very spot,\r\nlifted it up, looked, and there lay exactly five hundred dead flies.\r\nThen he went on until he reached a certain town, where he inquired for a\r\nblacksmith. Having found one, he ordered him to cut on the blade of his\r\nsabre this inscription: \"The hero Naznai, killer of five hundred at a\r\nblow.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went on, on--travelled little, travelled much, travelled as far\r\nas a frog can jump--until he came at last to a country where he had\r\nnever before been, and where he was himself unknown, and entered the\r\ncapital city of a great king. It was already growing dark, and Naznai\r\nwas beginning to wonder where he should spend the night, when he heard\r\nnot far away the sound of fifes, drums and singing. \"That's the place\r\nfor me,\" he said to himself: \"there's nothing worse than a dry throat\r\nand an empty stomach.\" So he went in the direction of the music. When he\r\ncame to the place he looked, and there stood a great building surrounded\r\nby a spacious courtyard, all full of men and women who were eating,\r\ndrinking and singing. \"Will you receive a guest?\" inquired Naznai,\r\nentering the courtyard. The servants rushed up to him, took his sabre,\r\nled him into the house, gave him the seat of honor, and made him eat and\r\ndrink until he was full up to the very nostrils. The house was the\r\npalace of the king's vizier, and they were celebrating that night the\r\nwedding of his son. When Naznai had eaten and drunk all he could--enough\r\nto last him for a month, the clever rascal!--the vizier asked him,\r\n\"Where do you come from, guest? Where is your city? Of what country are\r\nyou? Are you buying or selling?\"--\"Why should I talk about myself?\"\r\nreplied Naznai. \"Look at my sabre: that will tell you who I am.\" The\r\nvizier unsheathed the sabre, looked at it, stared first at Naznai and\r\nthen at the weapon, and finally rushed, sabre in hand, straight to the\r\nking. The king was even more astonished than the vizier. He sent for all\r\nthe eloquent fools in the city, called together all the wise men who\r\nhadn't any judgment, and held a great council. They all said to the\r\nking, \"You must take the hero Naznai from the land of Daghestan into\r\nyour service, no matter at what cost, no matter how much you may have to\r\nreward him: so long as he lives you will be as safe as if you were\r\nbehind an iron wall.\" Then the king sent for Naznai, and the vizier\r\nbrought him in. \"Hero Naznai from the land of Daghestan,\" said the\r\nking--\"first I, then you, I the father, you the son--take my only\r\ndaughter: live with me and defend my kingdom.\"--\"Hard as it is for me,\"\r\nreplied Naznai, twisting his moustache, \"I will do as you desire.\" That\r\nvery night he married the king's daughter, and went to sleep in her arms\r\non a bed from which if one should fall out not even so much as one's\r\nbones could ever be gathered together again.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a week Naznai was summoned to the king, and found him\r\nsitting on his throne surrounded by a great multitude of people. \"My\r\ndear son, Hero Naznai,\" said the king, \"I gave you my daughter and made\r\nyou my son with the hope that when a black day should come upon me you\r\nwould give me your help. The black day has come: a great dragon gives no\r\npeace to my flocks and my herds. Twice every year, at certain known\r\ntimes, he makes his appearance: to-morrow is the day of his coming. You\r\nmust go out to meet him: who should go if not you, the killer of five\r\nhundred men at a blow?\" No sooner did Naznai catch the word \"dragon\"\r\nthan his heart sank within him, and hardly had the king finished\r\nspeaking when he ran furiously out of doors. Some said that he had\r\nturned coward: others said, \"No: he ran out filled with rage against the\r\ndragon.\" In the mean time Naznai had gone home; and that night, as soon\r\nas his wife fell asleep, he took to his heels to save his head. He ran\r\nand ran and ran until he was so tired that he could run no farther, and\r\nat last came to a great forest. Fearing to sleep on the ground, he\r\nclimbed up into a tree, and, holding fast to a limb with each hand, he\r\nfell asleep. When he awoke he looked down, and there, coiled around the\r\ntrunk of the tree and fast asleep, lay the dragon. Overcome with terror,\r\nNaznai lost his hold, fell from the tree and came down plump on the\r\ndragon's back. The dragon thought that God in His wrath had struck him\r\nwith lightning: his heart burst and he gave up the ghost. Naznai\r\nstarted to run, but, looking over his shoulder, he saw that the dragon\r\ndid not move. Then he knew that it was dead, and going back he cut off\r\nits head and went with it to the king. \"Then that is what you call a\r\ndragon, is it?\" he demanded: \"in our Daghestan we have cats like that.\r\nWhy didn't you send some of your children after him, and not give me so\r\nmuch trouble?\" The king could think of nothing to say, and so was left\r\nwith his mouth open.\r\n\r\nAfter a little time the king sent for Naznai again, and said to him, \"My\r\ndear son-in-law, Hero Naznai, three _narts_ [giants] have invaded my\r\nkingdom and are harassing my people with their raids: to-morrow you must\r\ngo out against them.\" Again Naznai's heart sank within him, and he ran\r\nhome. At midnight he fled a second time from the city, took refuge in\r\nthe same forest as before, and, climbing up the very same tree, went to\r\nsleep. When it began to grow light he looked down, and there were the\r\nthree narts, who, having hoppled their horses and turned them out to\r\ngraze, were themselves resting under the tree. Naznai's soul went down\r\ninto his very toes: he almost fell from the tree in a swoon. Suddenly\r\none of the narts said to another, \"Now that the king has in his service\r\nthe hero Naznai, who kills five hundred at a blow, we must be more\r\ncareful than we have been, and not turn our horses out in this way to\r\ngraze.\"--\"We have never been afraid of any living thing yet,\" rejoined\r\nthe other: \"are we going to let him scare us?\" This led to a dispute\r\nwhich ended in a quarrel, and the three narts all killed one another.\r\nThen Naznai climbed down out of the tree, cut off their heads, stripped\r\nthem of their clothes and weapons, which he loaded upon two of their\r\nhorses, and, mounting the third, rode back to the city. Throwing down\r\nthe heads before the king, he said, \"Then those are your narts? We\r\nshould have called them orphan children in our Daghestan. What was the\r\nuse of sending a man after them? Women would have done as well.\" The\r\nking was surprised, so were all the people.\r\n\r\nA little while afterward the king summoned Naznai for the third time.\r\n\"My dear son-in-law,\" he said, \"an infidel king has declared war against\r\nme. Tomorrow at the head of my army you must invade his dominions:\r\notherwise the infidel hordes will come down like grass of the earth and\r\nlike the stars of heaven, and surround our capital.\" Again Naznai ran\r\nhome with a quaking heart. That night the king stationed a hundred\r\nsentinels around the hero's house to restrain him, lest his rash bravery\r\nshould impel him to go off alone in search of the infidel horde. In vain\r\nhe tried again and again to escape from the house: the sentinels always\r\nstopped him, and his wife worried over him as if she were afraid that he\r\nwould be carried away by some passing crow. In the morning the king\r\nassembled all his forces, put Naznai in the midst of them, and said,\r\n\"March now, and God go with you! Whoever does not obey my son-in-law's\r\norders, whoever does not do exactly as he sees him do, is a traitor.\"\r\nThe army marched away, taking one step forward to two or three steps\r\nbackward, until they came in sight of the infidel forces. Then Naznai's\r\nheart failed him: he grew hot under his clothes. He took off his shoes,\r\nso as to be able to run away faster, then his coat, and finally stripped\r\nhimself as bare as a cake of ice. The soldiers all followed his example,\r\nas the king had ordered. Just at that moment a hungry wandering dog ran\r\npast, and seizing one of Naznai's shoes (they were greased with mutton\r\ntallow: may their owner die!) set off with it in the direction of the\r\ninfidel army. \"Hm!\" exclaimed Naznai: \"so you'll make me a\r\nlaughing-stock too, will you?\" and, naked as he was, he started in\r\npursuit. After him rushed the whole naked army. \"Those are not men: they\r\nare devils,\" thought the infidels; and, filled with terror, they\r\nscattered in all directions, throwing away their weapons and abandoning\r\ntheir treasure. Naznai gathered up all the booty, and returned at the\r\nhead of the army to the kingdom of his father-in-law. Upon their\r\narrival they found that the king was dead, and the army with one voice\r\nchose Naznai as his successor. Ever afterward, when the conversation\r\nturned upon heroism and notable exploits, Naznai used to say, \"They who\r\nwill may boast of courage: _I_ would rather have good luck.\"\r\n\r\nIf the reader will take the trouble to compare the above rendering of\r\nthis story with the Hindoo variant entitled \"The Valiant\r\nChattee-Maker,\"[4] and the closely-related German version called by\r\nGrimm \"The Valiant Little Tailor,\"[5] he will see how far it surpasses\r\nthem both in unity of conception, in coherence of detail, in keen\r\nappreciation of humor and in skill of literary treatment. The grotesque\r\nstatement of impossibilities with which it begins is the Caucasian\r\nstory-teller's conventional method of forewarning his hearers that they\r\nare about to listen to a burlesque, a pure extravaganza, lying entirely\r\noutside the domain of fact and reality. There is no attempt made to give\r\nit the air of truth: on the contrary, the narrator takes especial pains\r\nto demolish what little intrinsic probability the story has by\r\nintroducing the conventional formula, \"Travelled little, travelled much,\r\ntravelled as far as a frog can jump,\" etc. This, like the jingle of a\r\ncourt-jester's bells, is intended to remind the hearer that nothing is\r\nto be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that men living in such wild, gloomy fastnesses as the\r\ntremendous ravines of the Eastern Caucasus--men whose characters have\r\nbeen hardened and tempered in the hot fires of war and the vendetta--men\r\nwho have the pride and fortitude of American Indians with the sternness\r\nand ferocity of Scandinavian Berserkers--should still be capable of\r\nappreciating and enjoying such anecdotes as \"The Kettle that Died\" and\r\n\"The Big Turnip,\" and such popular tales as \"The Hero Naznai.\" The\r\nfierce lust of war, which is perhaps the most salient feature of the\r\nmountaineer's character, and the sternness and hardness of mental and\r\nmoral fibre which it tends to produce, are generally supposed to be\r\nincompatible not only with the delicacy of perception upon which humor\r\nlargely depends, but with the very taste for humor itself; and yet in\r\nthe Caucasian mountaineer they are coexistent. How versatile the\r\nCaucasian character is, and how wide is the range of its tastes and\r\nsympathies, I shall show more fully hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe characters which figure in Caucasian popular tales are very\r\nnumerous, and are taken, as might be expected, from a great variety of\r\nsources. There are the stereotyped three brothers of German and Russian\r\nstories; the dragons, giants, were-wolves, wicked magicians, and\r\nbeautiful girls married to bears, of all Aryan folk-lore; and sundry\r\nnondescript personages with superhuman powers which have no exact\r\nanalogues among the other Aryan races, and seem to be original products\r\nof Caucasian fancy. Among the latter are _karts_, female ogres with\r\ncannibalistic tastes; _narts_, or giants of protean shapes and variable\r\ndispositions; and certain mysterious equestrians who are always\r\ndescribed as \"hare-riders.\" These three classes of supernatural beings,\r\nkarts, narts and hare-riders, are known to the whole body of the\r\nCaucasian mountaineers without distinction of tribe or race; and it is a\r\nsignificant fact that the two first mentioned have everywhere and in all\r\nCaucasian languages the same names. By whom they were originally\r\ninvented, and from what tongue their appellations were derived,\r\nphilologists can as yet only conjecture. Among the Ossetes, who are\r\nunquestionably an Aryan race, narts have a quasi-historical existence\r\nlike the Knights of the Round Table, and their lives and adventures have\r\nbeen woven by popular tradition into a sort of mediaeval epic resembling\r\nthe _Nibelungen Lied_ of Germany. Elsewhere, among the Chechenses, the\r\nAvars and the Circassians, narts are simply giants of the orthodox\r\nnursery type.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that we should also find among the _dramatis personae_\r\nof Caucasian popular tales such Old-Testament heroes as Jonah and\r\nSolomon, and such historical characters as the Roman Caesars. The former\r\nwere very likely introduced by the Jews and Arabs, whose descendants\r\nform no inconsiderable part of the present population, but the Roman\r\nemperors must have gained a foothold in Caucasian traditional lore\r\nbefore the downfall of the Byzantine Empire, and may have done so as\r\nlong ago as the reign of Augustus, when the lowlands of the Caucasus\r\nwere under Roman rule.\r\n\r\nNext to anecdotes and stories in importance and popularity come\r\nbeast-fables, of which the mountaineers have an almost endless number\r\nand variety. Animals, especially birds and foxes, figure more or less\r\nextensively throughout Caucasian literature, but in the beast-fables,\r\nproperly so called, they have the whole stage to themselves, and think,\r\nact and talk in perfect independence of natural laws and limitations.\r\nThe view taken by the mountaineers of the animal world seems to be the\r\nview of the Aryan races generally. With them, as with us, the fox is the\r\nembodiment of cunning, the ass of stupidity, and the bear of clumsy\r\nstrength and good-humored simplicity. If they can be said to have a\r\nfavorite animal, it is the wolf, whose predatory life, ferocity when at\r\nbay and ability to die fighting and in silence comprise all that in a\r\nmountaineer's eyes is most worthy of admiration. \"Short-eared wolf\" is a\r\nCaucasian girl's pet name for her lover, and \"wolf of the North\" was the\r\nmost complimentary title which the Chechenses could think of to head an\r\naddress to a distinguished Russian general whose gallantry in battle had\r\nwon their respect. The serpent, in the Caucasus, is the Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti of the brute world. To know as many languages as a serpent is\r\nthe _ne plus ultra_ of polyglot erudition. A swaggering coward is\r\ncompared to a drunken mouse; and many a boaster on the porch of the\r\nCaucasian village mosque has been silenced by some sceptical bystander\r\nwith the well-known quotation from a popular beast-fable: \"'What has\r\nbecome of all the cats?' inquired the drunken mouse.\" Of the Caucasian\r\nbeast-fables the following is a characteristic specimen:\r\n\r\n_The Jackal and the Fox._--Once upon a time a hunter set a trap and\r\nbaited it with a piece of fat mutton. Along came a hungry fox and\r\ndiscovered it, but, not daring to approach it, she proceeded to walk\r\nround and round it at a distance. In the mean time she was joined by a\r\njackal. The fox asked the jackal where he was going. \"Oh, I am almost\r\ndead with hunger,\" replied the jackal. \"I started to go to the village\r\nin search of something to eat, but I am afraid of the dogs.\"--\"Well,\r\nBrother Jackal,\" said the fox, \"I know a place not far from here where\r\nthere lies a big piece of fat mutton: how would you like that?\"--\"Why\r\ndon't you eat it yourself?\" inquired the jackal.--\"I'm now keeping\r\n_oroozh_\" [a Mohammedan fast], said the fox, \"but I'll show it to you.\"\r\nWhereupon she led the jackal to the trap. Hardly had the jackal seized\r\nthe mutton when the trap sprung and caught him by the neck. In trying to\r\nfree himself by shaking his head he dislodged the bait, which rolled\r\naway to one side. This was all that the fox had waited for: she quickly\r\nseized the mutton, and sat down composedly to eat it. \"Here!\" exclaimed\r\nthe jackal: \"I thought you said you were keeping a fast, and now you are\r\neating.\"--\"I was,\" replied the fox, \"but I have seen the moon,[6] and\r\nnow I am having a holiday.\"--\"But when am I going to have my holiday?\"\r\nasked the jackal.--\"When the owner of the trap comes,\" answered the fox,\r\nand so saying walked away.\r\n\r\nMost of the Caucasian literature to which I have hitherto had occasion\r\nto refer is the reflection of the lighter, more genial side of the\r\nmountaineer's character, and taken alone would give the impression that\r\nhe is an amiable, jovial, good-humored fellow with a keen sense of the\r\nludicrous and little knowledge of, or feeling for, the sorrows, the\r\nsufferings and the tragedies of life. Such an impression, however, would\r\nbe a wholly mistaken one; and in order that the reader may see how full\r\nof sorrow and suffering and tragedy his life really is, I will, before\r\ntaking up Caucasian poetry, give some extracts from a code of Caucasian\r\ncriminal law. I do this partly because the code itself is a legal and\r\nliterary curiosity, and partly because it shows better than any\r\ndescription could do the state of society in which a Caucasian\r\nmountaineer lives:\r\n\r\n_Laws of Ootsmee Rustem, Khan of Kaitaga._--1. To the reader of these\r\nordinances a piece of silk from him in whose favor the case shall be\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n2. He shall not read these laws for any one who has not a paper from the\r\n_bek_, with the impression of the bek's seal.\r\n\r\n_He who holds his tongue will save his head._\r\n\r\n1. He who kills a robber in his sheepfold or his house shall not be\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n2. He who kills the killer of a robber shall pay two fines and have two\r\nblood-enemies.\r\n\r\n3. One suspected of robbery shall clear himself by taking the oath of\r\npurgation, with seven compurgators.\r\n\r\n4. For robbery with murder, a sevenfold fine and seven blood-avengers.\r\n\r\n5. For robbery and murder of a woman, a fourteen-fold fine and fourteen\r\nblood-avengers.\r\n\r\n_He who holds his tongue will save his head._\r\n\r\n1. He who assaults a woman with intent to commit outrage shall forfeit a\r\nthousand yards of linen to the community.\r\n\r\n2. The life-blood of him who carries off a woman and keeps her by force\r\nshall count for nothing.\r\n\r\n3. If a slave touch a free woman, kill him.\r\n\r\n4. He who murders a Jew shall fill a part of his skin with silver and\r\ngive it to the bek.\r\n\r\n_He who holds his tongue will save his head._\r\n\r\n1. If one be killed in a fight between a number of persons, and the\r\nkiller be unknown, the relatives of the killed may count as blood-enemy\r\nany one whom they choose of those engaged in the fight.\r\n\r\n2. If in a general fight several persons are killed, the relatives of\r\nthose who die first shall be the blood-seekers of the relatives of those\r\nwho die last.\r\n\r\n3. If one die from wounds inflicted by several persons, count two of\r\nthem blood-enemies, and after the killing of one take a fine from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n4. He who kills another and hides the body shall pay a sevenfold fine\r\nand have seven blood-avengers.\r\n\r\n_He who holds his tongue will save his head._\r\n\r\n1. He who does not at once leave the village where his blood-seekers\r\nlive shall forfeit one hundred yards of linen for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n2. If a blood-enemy claim refuge, do not send him away: receive him.\r\n\r\n3. If he wishes to go away, let no one travel with him.\r\n\r\n4. If one be killed while travelling with a blood-enemy, his blood shall\r\ncount for nothing.\r\n\r\n5. Him through whose betrayal a blood-enemy is killed, count as himself\r\na blood-enemy, with all his family.\r\n\r\n_He who holds his tongue will save his head._\r\n\r\n1. The bek shall summon the general assembly every year: if he does not,\r\nremove him.\r\n\r\n2. From him who does not come at the bek's call take a hundred yards of\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\n3. From a country without a ruler, from a community without a general\r\nassembly, from a flock without a shepherd, from an army without a leader\r\nand from a village without aldermen, no good will come. Let him who has\r\nsense think of this.\r\n\r\n4. Have a care, bek! Speak the truth. Truth exalts a man and makes his\r\npower endure for ever. The earth does not consume, but glorifies, the\r\nbody of him whom God has blessed.\r\n\r\n5. Have a care, people of Kaitaga! Receive the truth. It is by justice\r\nand truth that a community becomes great.\r\n\r\nThe above are only a few extracts from a long and detailed code of\r\ncriminal law written in Arabic and preserved in the mosque of an East\r\nCaucasian village. The separate rules are known as _adats_, or\r\nprecedents, and the system of jurisprudence founded upon them is called\r\n\"trial by adat,\" to distinguish it from the course of procedure laid\r\ndown in the Koran and known as \"trial by _shariat_.\" It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that in such a state of society as that reflected in\r\nthis barbarous and archaic code of laws there must exist the elements of\r\nthe profoundest tragedy and almost infinite possibilities of suffering.\r\nOut of grief, tragedy and suffering grows the literature of heroism,\r\nbearing fruit in such fierce triumphant songs as the one which follows.\r\nIt is supposed to be sung by the spirit of a mountaineer who has been\r\nkilled in battle:\r\n\r\n          THE DEATH-SONG OF THE CHECHENSE.\r\n\r\n          The earth is drying on my grave, and thou art forgetting me,\r\n            O my own mother!\r\n          The weeds are overgrowing my burial-place, and they deaden even\r\n            thy sorrow, O my aged father!\r\n          The tears fall no more from the eyes of my sister, and from her\r\n            heart the misery is passing away;\r\n          But do not thou forget me, O my elder brother! until thou shalt\r\n            have avenged my death;\r\n          And do not thou forget me, O my younger brother! until thou\r\n            shalt lie beside me.\r\n          Thou art hot, O bullet! and thou bringest death, but hast thou\r\n            not been my true slave?\r\n          Thou art black, O earth! and thou coverest me, but have I not\r\n            spurned thee under my very horses' feet?\r\n          Thou art cold, O death! but I _have_ been _thy_ master.\r\n          My body is the inheritance of earth, but my soul rises in\r\n            triumph to heaven.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find in any literature a song which breathes a\r\nfiercer, more indomitable, spirit of heroism than this. The mountaineer\r\nis dead; he can fight no more; his body lies in the black earth; but his\r\nfreed soul is as proud, defiant and unconquerable as ever. He takes a\r\nfierce delight even beyond the grave in taunting the bullet which has\r\nkilled him with having once been his slave; in reminding the earth which\r\ncovers him that he has spurned it under his horses' hoofs; and in\r\nmocking and defying even death itself. They have destroyed his body, but\r\nnothing has subdued, or ever can subdue, the brave, proud spirit which\r\ntenanted it. That, and not the body, was the man's true self, and that\r\nstill lives to exult over bullet, grave and death.\r\n\r\nSo far is the true mountaineer from being afraid of death, that he\r\nseems to take a savage pleasure in imagining it in its most horrible\r\nforms and dwelling upon its most repulsive and terrifying features,\r\nmerely to have the satisfaction of triumphing over it in fancy. As an\r\nillustration of this I give below a part of another Chechense song\r\ncalled \"The Song of Khamzat.\" Khamzat was a celebrated _abrek_, or\r\nCaucasian Berserker, who harried the Russian armed line of the Terek\r\nwith bloody and destructive raids before and during the reign of the\r\ngreat Caucasian hero Shamyl. He was finally overtaken and surrounded by\r\na large Russian force on the summit of a high hill near the river Terek,\r\ncalled the Circassian Gora. Finding it impossible to escape, he and his\r\nmen slaughtered their horses, built a breastwork of their bodies, and\r\nbehind this bloody half-living wall fought until they were literally\r\nannihilated. The song of which the following are the closing lines was\r\ncomposed in commemoration of Khamzat's heroic defence and death. Just\r\nbefore the final Russian onset he is supposed to see a bird flying over\r\nthe field of battle in the direction of his native village, and he\r\naddresses it as follows:\r\n\r\n          O aerial bird! carry to Akh Verdi Mohammed, the ruler of Hikka,\r\n            our last farewell:\r\n          Bid good-bye to our sweethearts, the fair girls of Hikka,\r\n          And tell them that our breasts are a wall which will stop the\r\n            Russian bullets:\r\n          Tell them that we had hoped to lie in the graveyard of our\r\n            native village,\r\n          Where our sisters would have come to weep over our graves,\r\n          Where sorrowful relatives would have gathered to mourn our\r\n            death.\r\n          But God has not granted us this last favor: instead of the\r\n            weeping of sisters,\r\n          Over us will be heard the growls of fighting wolves;\r\n          Instead of sorrowing relatives, here will assemble clouds of\r\n            croaking ravens:\r\n          The ravens will drink up our eyes and the bloodthirsty wolves\r\n            will devour our bodies.\r\n          Tell them all, O bird! that on the Circassian mountain, in the\r\n            land of the infidel,\r\n          With naked sabres in our hands, we all lie dead.\r\n\r\nThe reader who merely sees this song on a printed page in an imperfect\r\nprose translation can form little conception of the thrilling effect\r\nwhich it produces when sung by an excited woman to the fierce wild music\r\nof the Caucasian highlanders amid a group of Khamzat's fiery and\r\nsensitive countrymen. Their faces flush with strong emotion, their hands\r\nclose with nervous grip upon the hilts of their long kinjals, and their\r\nbright eyes slowly fill with tears of mingled grief, rage and pity as\r\nthe excited singer wails out the dying words of their lost leader.\r\n\r\nThe heroic poetry of the Caucasian mountaineers is largely taken up with\r\nrecitals of their freebooting exploits and achievements in the valley of\r\nGeorgia, usually in the form of songs or ballads, which all breathe the\r\nsame fierce, proud, cruel spirit. In the diction there is very little\r\nart. Rhyme, although it is known to the mountaineers, is seldom used,\r\nand their poetry is, as a rule, nothing more than rhythmical or blank\r\nverse broken into irregular stanzas of from seven to eleven metrical\r\nfeet. This kind of verse they improvise with great readiness and\r\nfacility. It seems to be the form of expression which their stronger\r\nfeelings naturally take. I have heard an Avarian mother chant amid her\r\nsobs an improvised but rhythmical lament over the body of her dead\r\nchild. Rude as Caucasian poetry is, however, in construction, fierce and\r\nwarlike as it generally is in spirit, one meets occasionally in\r\nCaucasian songs with the most delicate and graceful conceptions.\r\nContrast, for example, \"The Song of Khamzat\" or \"The Death-Song of the\r\nChechense\" with the following bit of Avarian poetry, which I have taken\r\nthe liberty of calling:\r\n\r\n          GLAMOUR.\r\n\r\n          Come out of doors, O mother! and see what a wonder is here:\r\n          Up through the snows of the mountain the flowers of spring\r\n            appear.\r\n          Come out on the roof, O mother! and see how along the ravine\r\n          The glacier-ice is covered with the springtime's leafy green!\r\n\r\n          There are no flowers, my daughter: 'tis only because thou art\r\n            young\r\n          That blossoms from under the mountain-snows appear to thee to\r\n            have sprung.\r\n          There is no grass on the glacier: the blades do not even start;\r\n          But thou art in love, and the grass and flowers are springing\r\n            in thy heart.\r\n\r\nI have space for only one more specimen of Caucasian heroic literature,\r\na brief oration of Kazi Mullah, the friend and teacher of Shamyl and\r\nthe founder of Caucasian Muridism. An imperfect translation of this\r\nspeech will be found in Latham's _Races of the Russian Empire_. Copies\r\nof it in Arabic were widely circulated throughout Daghestan immediately\r\nafter its delivery, and it probably contributed more than any other\r\nsingle thing to bring on the general insurrection of the East Caucasian\r\nmountaineers in 1832. In the spring of that year the inhabitants of a\r\nsmall aoul or mountain-village in Central Daghestan--I think\r\nKhunzakh--were assembled one evening in the walled courtyard of one of\r\nits houses under the minaret of the village mosque for the purpose of\r\nsocial enjoyment. Tradition relates that they were celebrating a\r\nwedding. A fire had been built in the middle of the courtyard, and\r\naround it picturesquely-dressed men and women were singing and dancing\r\nto the accompaniment of fifes, kettledrums and tambourines. Suddenly\r\nthere appeared in the circular gallery of the minaret which overlooked\r\nthe courtyard the figure of a tall, gray-bearded stranger, a mullah,\r\nwhose green turban marked his lineal descent from the family of the\r\nProphet. He looked down for a moment with stern displeasure into the\r\nfire-lighted courtyard, and then putting his hands to his lips chanted\r\nthe Mohammedan call to prayers. The music and merrymaking instantly\r\nceased, and the sweet weird chant rang out far and wide through the\r\nstill evening air over the silent village, dying away at last in a long\r\nmusical cry of _La illaha il Allah!_ (\"There is no God but God\"). Amid\r\nprofound silence Kazi Mullah--for the gray-bearded stranger was that\r\nrenowned priest--stretched out his hand over the crowded courtyard and\r\nwith slow stern gravity said:\r\n\r\n\"Upon all your merrymakings and feasts, upon all your marriages and\r\nrejoicings, upon yourselves, your children and your households, upon\r\neverything that you do, have and are, rests the awful curse of God!\r\nHeaven has marked you with the black seal of eternal damnation because\r\nyou still grovel in sin and refuse to obey the voice and teachings of\r\nour holy Prophet. Your duty is to spread with the sword the light of our\r\nholy faith throughout the world; but what have you done? what are you\r\ndoing? Miserable cowards! without faith and without religion! you pursue\r\neagerly the pleasures of this life, but you despise the law of God and\r\nof his holy Prophet. Vain are your selfish prayers--vain is your daily\r\nattendance at the mosque. Heaven rejects your heartless sacrifices. The\r\npresence of the Russian infidel blocks up the way to the throne of God!\r\nRepent, pray, and arm yourselves for the war of the Most High. The hour\r\ndraws near when I shall call you forth and consecrate you for the holy\r\nsacrifice of battle.\"\r\n\r\nThis impassioned speech fell like a lighted torch into a perfect\r\npowder-magazine of religious enthusiasm. Copies of it in Arabic were\r\nborne from village to village by mounted Murids; other mullahs took up\r\nKazi's cry of _gazavat_ (war for the faith), using his speech as a text\r\nfor their excited harangues; and in less than a month the whole district\r\nwas in a blaze of insurrection. Kazi Mullah himself was the first victim\r\nof the fire of war which his eloquence had kindled. He was killed while\r\nfighting desperately at the storming of the aoul of Ghimry by a column\r\nof Russian infantry under Baron Rosen, on October 17, 1832.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to give in the preceding songs and in the speech of\r\nKazi Mullah an idea of the nature and the spirit of Caucasian heroic\r\nliterature. I will turn now in closing to the literature of sorrow and\r\nsuffering, which is the black shadow cast by heroism across the\r\nthreshold of domestic life. Heroic literature is the voice of Caucasian\r\nmanhood: the literature of suffering is the cry of bereaved women.\r\n\r\nThe following lines are the lament of an Avarian girl whose lover has\r\nbeen killed while making a raid with a troop of Lesghian horsemen\r\nthrough the valley of Georgia:\r\n\r\n          My beloved went away into the valley of the Alazan,\r\n                     and as he left me he looked over his shoulder\r\n                     at every step.\r\n          My clear-eyed one rode down into the lowlands of\r\n              Georgia, and his horse was fleet and fearless\r\n              as a mountain-wolf.\r\n          But from the depths of the lowlands has come the\r\n              bitter news that our mountain-hawks will never\r\n              more return:\r\n          From the far-away valley of Georgia have come the\r\n              scorching tidings that our lions lie dead in the\r\n              pass with broken talons.\r\n          O merciful God! if I were only an eagle, that I might\r\n              touch once more those cold dead hands!\r\n          O almighty One! if I were only a wild dove of the\r\n              cliffs, that I might look once more into that\r\n              pale dead face!\r\n          I envy thee, I envy thee, O jackal of Georgia! thou\r\n              feedest upon the bodies of those who wore\r\n              weapons of steel!\r\n          I envy thee, I envy thee, O raven of the river! thou\r\n              drinkest the eyes of those who rode to battle on\r\n              swift horses.\r\n          The jackal devours the bodies of the warriors who\r\n              bore weapons of steel, and skulks away into\r\n              the depths of the forest:\r\n          The raven drinks up the eyes of those who rode to\r\n              battle on swift horses, and with hoarse croaks\r\n              vanishes in the blue sky.\r\n\r\nThere is no attempt in this wild lament to soften or mitigate the\r\nhorrors of a violent death by throwing around it a halo of heroism and\r\nglory. The woman cares not what prodigies of valor her lover performed,\r\nbut she dwells with self-torturing vividness of imagination upon the\r\nhelpless and abandoned body which she can never again see or touch, but\r\nwhich the ravens and jackals can tear and mutilate at will.\r\n\r\nCompare with this the following lament of a Lesghian woman over the body\r\nof her dead husband:\r\n\r\n          I would stand on the shore of the green ocean if I only knew\r\n          That I should see the diamond which has fallen into its surges:\r\n          I would climb to the lonely summit of the highest mountain if I\r\n            only knew\r\n          That I should find a spring flower blossoming in the blue ice.\r\n          If one look carefully one may see the diamond which has fallen\r\n            into the ocean,\r\n          But never again shall I see the life which has gone:\r\n          If one search patiently one may find a spring flower rooted in\r\n            the blue ice,\r\n          But never again shall I find the swift falcon which has flown\r\n            away.\r\n          Henceforth I live upon an earth which is no longer a world,\r\n          And in a world which has no longer a heaven.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain rude art in the way in which the asserted possibility\r\nof two evident impossibilities is made to lead up to and heighten the\r\nutter hopelessness of the third. The diamond may be recovered from the\r\ndepths of the ocean; the flower which has withered and died may spring\r\nagain even from glacier-ice; but the soul once gone is gone for ever:\r\nthe great disaster of death is irretrievable even in imagination. There\r\nis no hint or suggestion here of any possible resurrection of the body\r\nor of reunion beyond the grave: I cannot recall any Caucasian lament in\r\nwhich there is. But whether the omission is due to the breaking down of\r\nfaith under the strain of grief, or whether it is conventionally\r\nimproper in a lament to allude to anything which would lighten the sense\r\nof bereavement, I do not know.\r\n\r\nWith these two characteristic illustrations of the form of expression\r\nwhich sorrow takes in Caucasian life, I must close my brief and\r\nimperfect sketch of Caucasian literature. I hope I have amply proved the\r\nassertions which I made in a previous paper with regard to the\r\noriginality and innate intellectual capacity of the Caucasian\r\nhighlanders; but whether I have or not, the reader must, I am sure,\r\nadmit that the proverbs, songs and anecdotes above translated are at\r\nleast indications of great latent capability, of unusual versatility of\r\ntalent, and of a wide range of human feeling and sympathy. It is\r\npossible that I overestimate their value on account of my inability to\r\nseparate the impressions made upon me by the people themselves from\r\nthose made by their literature; but I am confident that the general\r\noutlines of the Caucasian character as I have tried here to sketch them\r\nare accurate, and that the reader would fully appreciate and admit the\r\nsignificance of the literature if he could make the personal\r\nacquaintance of the people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I cannot better express my own opinion of the Caucasian\r\nmountaineers than by adopting the words of A. Viskovatof, one of the\r\nfairest and most discriminating of Russian travellers: \"Nature has not\r\nproperly brought out the moral and intellectual capacity of the\r\nCaucasian highlanders. Through the superficial crust of ignorance and\r\nwildness you may see in every mountaineer a frank and acute intellect,\r\nand, brigand though he may be, he still shows evidences of human\r\nfeeling and of a soul. His brigandage, indeed, is only the external\r\nroughness which results naturally from his education, his circumstances\r\nand his mode of life. Beneath it there are intellect, feeling, manliness\r\nand strength of character. Under certain conditions of course these very\r\ntraits go to make up the daring, skilful mountain-brigand whom we know;\r\nbut separate him from his surroundings, educate him in the civilized\r\nworld, and you have a capable, energetic, intellectual and feeling man.\r\nLove of honor and love of fame are, generally speaking, among the\r\nstrongest actuating impulses of the mountaineer's character; and these\r\nwere the very impulses which kept him always hostile to the Russians,\r\nwhich impelled him constantly to engage in partisan warfare, and which\r\nenabled him to resist so long and with such terrible strength all\r\nRussia's efforts to subdue him. Was it merely for plunder that parties\r\nof mountaineers used to assemble in front of our lines and throw\r\nthemselves furiously upon our outposts? No: the leaders of those parties\r\nreminded them in forcible and eloquent speeches of the deeds of their\r\nheroic fathers and forefathers, of the glory to be won in battle with\r\nthe _giours_, of the exploits of their brothers and countrymen who had\r\nleft their bodies on Russian soil; and they fought for honor and fame.\r\nWhat made the Chechenses hold out so long and so desperately, suffering\r\nhunger and peril and hardship, dying, and sending their children to die,\r\nin battle? Was it a spirit of blind submission to Shamyl and their\r\nreligious leaders, or an unreasoning hatred of infidels, or a thirst for\r\nplunder and rapine? Not at all. It was the love of independence--the\r\nnatural devotion of brave men who were fighting for their country, their\r\nhonor and their freedom.\"\r\n\r\n  GEORGE KENNAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n          You brought me a flower of spring\r\n            When the winter airs were cold,\r\n          And the birds began to sing,\r\n            And the gloom turned swift to gold.\r\n\r\n          The world looked chilly and dark,\r\n            But you called a flash from the sky:\r\n          Your clear eyes kindled a spark\r\n            Of splendor that cannot die.\r\n\r\n          O Love with the heart of Truth!\r\n             What is it you lay at my feet?\r\n          The bloom of your glorious youth,\r\n             Its flower and radiance sweet?\r\n\r\n          I lift to my lips the flower,\r\n            For thanks seem worthless and weak,\r\n          And I bless the beautiful hour,\r\n            But I have no word to speak.\r\n\r\n                     CELIA THAXTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH WINDING WAYS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not enough of a hero even in my own story to dwell upon the events\r\nof the two following years. I graduated with honors, of which I was\r\nsecretly and my mother and Mr. Floyd ostentatiously proud. Then my\r\nguardian and I set out upon our travels. Travel was something different\r\nin those times from what it is to-day, but Mr. Floyd had for years been\r\nfamiliar with the best of European life, and this gave me opportunities\r\nsuch as few men of my age possessed. We spent our second winter in the\r\nEast: then returned to Florence, and were planning a few months more of\r\nadventure when we received the news of Mr. Raymond's death. Mr. Floyd\r\nhad but one thought after this, which was that now at last his little\r\ngirl was his own again.\r\n\r\nHe had had an accident in Damascus--a fall which in itself was not\r\nserious, causing mere contusion and sprains, but it had resulted in a\r\nsevere illness by the time we reached Alexandria. Harry Dart had been\r\nwith us in Egypt and Palestine, but was obliged to leave us, and for a\r\nmonth or more I had nursed my guardian assiduously, with a fear lest\r\nthis was to be the end of a sacred and beloved existence. He too feared\r\nit, and between his intervals of pain would say, \"I want to see my\r\nlittle girl once more: I must see your mother. Oh, why do we separate\r\nourselves from those we love?\" But he rallied, and finally regained his\r\nordinary health, and before May we were again in Florence in our old\r\nrooms and talking of joining Harry Dart at Venice, when Helen's letter\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd sent for me at once when he had read the news. I found him\r\nlying on a sofa in his great dingy parlor, with its heavily-moulded\r\nceilings frescoed into dusky richness, its sides hung with heavy crimson\r\ndraperies and decaying canvases, out of whose once splendid pigments\r\ncolor and meaning had faded long ago.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it, my boy,\" said he softly: \"my father-in-law is dead. Mr.\r\nRaymond died the twenty-second of April.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little Helen!\" I exclaimed: \"is she all alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy your mother is with her,\" he returned, glancing back at the\r\nletter. \"She says she shall send for Mrs. Randolph. She and I are\r\nexecutors of the old man's will. I try to feel solemn over the death,\"\r\nhe went on gravely. \"With all our belief in immortality, death is a\r\nterrible thing to regard closely. But yet he was an old, old man: am I\r\nwrong that I cannot mourn for him?\"\r\n\r\nWe went about our preparations for return at once. Vanished were our\r\nplans for Venice and the Alps. I had looked forward with pleasure to\r\nspending my summer with Dart. No man in the world is so good a comrade\r\nas an enthusiastic painter, and Harry was keen of eye, with an exquisite\r\npleasure in form and color: nothing came amiss to him between earth and\r\nsky. It had been a pleasant dream with us to go together about Venice,\r\nrowed by some sweet-voiced Luigi or Antonio from one stretch of\r\nsea-kissed marble palace-steps to another--to spend our mornings in dim\r\nbasilicas, our afternoons away across the widening lagoons, and finish\r\nthe day in the square of San Marco listening to Bellini's and Verdi's\r\nairs. But now that this sweet idleness of Italy must be put by, I was\r\nglad that we were to come back home again. I was a little surprised to\r\nfind myself almost as eager as Mr. Floyd in making preparations for\r\nreturn. In a week we were on the ocean.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd had seemed to enjoy our travels. He was always in good\r\nspirits, always a brilliant and engaging talker, a pleased observer and\r\nclever analyst. Harry and I had made the usual display of unlimited\r\nfastidiousness which youth delights in, but our elder had taken\r\neverything more kindly. He could not fatigue himself, and rarely looked\r\nat more than two or three pictures at a time.\r\n\r\n\"I used to feel,\" he would say, \"if I went away from a gallery without\r\na crick in my back and a blinding headache that I had no realization of\r\nmy aesthetic privileges. Now-a-days I am willing to confess that I find\r\ntoo much of everything. Besides, all these pictures have been so\r\noverpraised! Let us find some pleasure that is not in the guide-books.\"\r\n\r\nThis was his tone, and I discovered in it at times, despite all his\r\ncheerfulness, a strange fatigue of spirit. But now that he was on his\r\nway home he had suddenly become exuberantly joyful.\r\n\r\n\"It is so delightful,\" he would remark to me, \"to realize once more that\r\nthe chief end of man is not, after all, to have fluent meditations upon\r\nwrecks of lost empires--to discover beauty in hideousness because\r\nsomebody else pretends to do so--to mumble praises about frescoes which\r\nare frightful to look at, and break your neck besides--to have profound\r\nemotions in Jerusalem and experience awe before pyramids and sphinxes.\r\nThis fictitious life we have been leading is very elegant, no doubt, and\r\ngives one material for just criticisms, but, strictly between us, I\r\nthink it dreadfully tiresome. I shall never go into it again. I suppose\r\nmy little girl will want to go abroad now that she can do what she\r\nchooses, but I shall let you take care of her, Floyd.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed. \"You will find Helen a magnificent young lady by this time,\"\r\nI returned. \"She is seventeen, is she not? A good many men will fight\r\nfor the pleasure of showing her about, and likely as not she will not\r\nlook at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is as old as her mother was when I married her,\" said Mr. Floyd\r\nthoughtfully. \"Can it be that people will want to be marrying my little\r\ngirl? I want her all to myself for a time. Who knows how long? I have\r\nbeen a lonely man, and now I want close, intimate human companionship. I\r\nam tired of doing, I am tired of thinking. I am out of politics: I am\r\nready for enjoyment. It seems to me I can be very happy with Helen and\r\nyour mother close at hand. We shall not be a dreary family. Your mother\r\nand I can sit together and talk: you and Helen can have your little\r\namusements. Now that she is to be quite unrestricted, I hope and expect\r\na little nonsense from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir--\" I began hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"But what, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot believe that we are all to live together. It is time for me\r\nto make a beginning in life, and my mother must be with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have made a very handsome beginning,\" returned Mr. Floyd dryly.\r\n\"Once for all, Floyd, I will have no nonsense of independence and pride\r\nfrom you. You are to me as my own son. I may talk much of Helen, because\r\nour love for women is of the kind that gives us the impulse to proclaim\r\nit, but she is scarcely more dear to me than you are. You are part of my\r\nlife now: don't fret me and make me miserable by deserting me. Be as\r\nfree as air and follow out every wish of your heart, yet, all the same,\r\nfeel that your home is where my home is, your interests where mine are.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as we landed we had news of my mother having joined Helen at The\r\nHeadlands shortly after Mr. Raymond's death. Mr. Floyd wasted not an\r\nhour in New York, but went on to his daughter at once. I lingered behind\r\nhim, detained in part by some delays at the custom-house. I longed to\r\nsee my mother, but felt, though with but little of the old jealousy,\r\nthat Mr. Floyd had almost the best right to see her first, because,\r\nnow-a-days, I was always looking the truth square in the face, and\r\nrealizing that it could not be long before cruel and irremediable loss\r\nwas to encompass us, and that the rest of our lives we should have not\r\nsubstance, but shadowy memories only, in place of this dear friend of\r\nours. So I let him speed on to The Headlands, and dreamed of the\r\nlove-flush on the cheeks of the two women who met him there.\r\n\r\nI knew comparatively little of my old set of friends, and of late Jack\r\nHolt had almost slipped out of my circle of correspondents. I was aware\r\nthat his marriage had been delayed the previous year and the time fixed\r\nfor Christmas, but neither Harry nor I had been advised of it, and my\r\nmother had only written that she heard there were fresh delays, and that\r\nthe elder Holt had involved his firm in difficulties. I determined,\r\ntherefore, to stop at Belfield on my way to The Headlands and see Jack\r\nand all the old friends I might still have remaining there. Of late\r\nyears my passing associations had become so diffused with their endless\r\ntransitions that every memory of my old home was becoming more and more\r\nfixed and permanent, the nucleus of my recollection distinct and\r\nunchangeable.\r\n\r\nI reached Belfield early one morning late in May. The season was perhaps\r\na little late, for the apple trees were still in bloom, and the village\r\nlooked fair and virginal as a bride on her wedding-day. I walked along\r\nthe wide pleasant streets with a curious pain. The years that lay\r\nbetween me and the last day I had paced these broad walks under the pale\r\ngreenery of the elms seemed legendary and dreamlike. There was the\r\nschoolhouse on the hill, and the well-worn playground about it. Beyond\r\nlay the woods, half colored now with clear pellucid green, gleams of\r\nsilver and shades of scarlet here and there. My mind reverted with\r\nclearness to the little nooks and dingles of the hills and meadows\r\nthereabouts: I remembered a woodland spring boiling up in a hollow of\r\nthe greenest grass I ever saw, and in the copse beside it grew the most\r\nbeautiful rose-tinted anemones. I could have gone to the foot of a great\r\noak and found the root of white violets which had been one of my\r\nearliest and dearest secrets; and I wondered--with a longing\r\ninexpressibly strong to go and seek it--if there were still a nest in a\r\nlittle hollow I knew of, where in my time I had watched scores of\r\nyellow-beaked nestlings.\r\n\r\nI went past the house where my mother and I had lived so many years. It\r\nwas so changed I should not have recognized it, repainted and modernized\r\nwith much show of glass and bow-windows. There were few people to be\r\nseen along the white walks until I met the stream from the post-office.\r\nOld men and boys, shy girls and children, came out with their letters\r\nand papers just as in the old time. Some of the men, grown corpulent and\r\ngray, I recognized with the old feeling of reverence and love, and\r\nstopped to speak with them. But Belfield life, slow and stagnant though\r\nit was, was busy enough to have filled their minds with fresher\r\nmemories, and I was so nearly forgotten that there was small pleasure in\r\nreminding them of the lad who had grown from babyhood into a tall\r\nstripling among them. My sentiment passed. I looked about more coldly\r\neven at the street that led to the cottage where Georgy Lenox lived, and\r\nwent on briskly to the great stone house of the Holts. Georgy would be\r\nthere of course: impossible that another Easter could have passed\r\nwithout her being a bride. I wondered as I entered the open iron gate\r\nwhat she would say to me.\r\n\r\nThe place had seemed splendid to me as a boy, and I well remembered how\r\nall the beautiful wonders of the spring blossomed here as nowhere else.\r\nBut now these grounds too seemed to have suffered a change: there was an\r\nair of neglect about the unpruned hedges, with straggling blossoms\r\nrunning riotously over fence and shrubbery; the beds of hyacinths and\r\ntulips were trampled, and as I neared the house I saw that the blinds\r\nswung carelessly and the old look of thrift and prosperity was quite\r\nabsent. Still, I observed all this dreamily, wondering, as returned\r\ntravellers are apt to do, if the change were in the things themselves or\r\nin my own eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" thought I, \"Jack and his wife live in New York,\" when,\r\nsuddenly answering my doubt, Jack himself came down the avenue in his\r\nlight wagon.\r\n\r\nI stepped aside, standing still, and he regarded me at first absently,\r\nthen with startled curiosity, and sharply drew his skittish mare back on\r\nher haunches. \"Good God, Floyd!\" said he, \"how glad I am to see you!\" We\r\nlooked straight in each other's face for a time, and his features\r\nworked, as he regarded me, with some emotion. \"You were going to the\r\nhouse?\" said he. \"Nobody could see you. I have been driving father to\r\nthe factories to-day, and he is not so well after it, and my mother is\r\nwith him. I have to be back at twelve, so jump in and come out with me.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed him. It was but two years since we had parted, but he had aged\r\nand seemed quite different from the Jack Holt of former times. He was\r\nroughly dressed, and, though scrupulously neat and shaven, looked, I am\r\nsure, fifteen years my senior. He touched his whip, and the mare plunged\r\ndown the avenue at a pace too disconcerting to allow either of us to\r\nspeak for a few moments, and we were at least a mile away before her\r\nswinging canter subsided into a trot.\r\n\r\n\"What is her name?\" I asked, laughing. \"It ought to be Mary Magdalen,\r\nfor she has seven devils in her this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember the Duchess?\" he inquired with a flicker of\r\nsomething like a smile crossing his heavy face. \"You christened her\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered the Duchess. The yearling colt had been given to him on his\r\nsixteenth birthday. He wanted to call her Georgy, but his mother forbade\r\nit: so we named her after that duchess of Devonshire who had made the\r\nname famous.\r\n\r\n\"You'll find I have forgotten nothing,\" I replied, \"but my thoughts are\r\nsuch a medley that I can't settle them at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you return?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only four days ago: I have not seen my mother yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have come to look me up? Floyd, that is kind.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in his cool, pleasant tones touched me powerfully. \"I knew\r\nnothing about you,\" I blurted out. \"Why, Jack, at this minute I'm not\r\nsure if you are married or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not married,\" he said softly. He was not used to reply so quickly,\r\nand I waited for him to speak before I questioned him further. \"I am\r\nwell,\" he said presently, \"and mother is in her usual health. Have you\r\nheard about my father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Both Harry and I have famished for news of you.\"\r\n\r\nI could see a little trouble in his face: he would have preferred that\r\nsomebody else should have broken his news to me. But he sighed, and went\r\non without flinching. \"My father had a paralytic stroke in December,\" he\r\nexplained in his deliberate, gentle voice. \"When once our eyes were\r\nopened we could easily comprehend that for months his mind had been\r\nfailing. When the bad news came the accumulation of trouble was too much\r\nfor him. We thought at first nothing could save him, but he rallied\r\nphysically. His mind has quite gone, however,\" Jack added, his voice\r\ntrembling: \"his brain has softened.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him speechlessly: I knew by instinct that I had not heard\r\nthe worst.\r\n\r\n\"The moment I saw you,\" pursued Jack, \"my first thought was, 'I hope he\r\nknows the whole story.' You heard nothing of our failure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"The firm of Holt & Strong suspended payment last December,\" said he\r\nwith a deep flush rising to his temples. \"There were two companies, you\r\nknow: I was only in Holt & Co. Strong was in Europe. My poor father's\r\nweakness did not display itself openly, but took the form of mad secret\r\nspeculations. It is a long story, Floyd. There were no bounds to his\r\nschemes, in which he involved not only himself, but others. He was\r\npresident of the savings bank too, you may remember. The troubles began\r\nwith the failure of a house in New York to which we owed something. He\r\nwas pressed: there was a whisper of something wrong, and of course there\r\ncame a run on the bank. I was not here. My father sent for me: when I\r\ncame I found a riotous mob outside the closed doors, and he lay\r\ninsensible in the bank parlor. He never recovered any real\r\nconsciousness, and for weeks we worked in the dark. There was much to\r\nbear. I could have endured every loss without a murmur, had it not been\r\nfor the cruelty of some of his smallest creditors.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a few minutes, but when I would have spoken he motioned\r\nme to be silent, and presently went on: \"There are men to-day who\r\npretend to believe that my father's mental state is as perfect as\r\never--that he is merely shielding himself from punishment by shamming\r\nimbecility. Ah, well! let me continue. Just at this juncture one of our\r\nbuildings was destroyed by fire. The insurance policy had lapsed, and he\r\nhad failed to renew it. The factory was packed with goods ready for\r\nshipment. The loss to Holt & Strong was a quarter of a million of\r\ndollars.\" He stopped again, and I saw him moisten his dry lips. \"The\r\nchief creditors,\" he resumed, \"were honorable men. By the first of March\r\nwe had agreed upon terms of adjustment. My mother gave up all she had.\r\nMy sisters are angry with me that I allowed her to strip the house of\r\neverything that had possessed a moneyed value, and think it shameful\r\nthat I despoiled her of her jewels. But such things did not count with\r\nmy mother and me. I kept the Duchess--nothing else.\" He smiled sombrely\r\nas he pulled out his watch. It was the little silver one he had used\r\nwhen we played marbles together. \"We paid fifty cents on the dollar,\" he\r\nsaid presently, \"and by and by shall manage something of a dividend at\r\nthe bank. It will give me plenty to do for years yet,\" he added with a\r\npeculiar smile.\r\n\r\n\"You have assumed your father's debts?\" I exclaimed. \"That seems a\r\nneedless penalty, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father and I are as one,\" said he gently. \"It was fortunate for me\r\nin every way that I was not my father's partner. When I entered Holt &\r\nCo. he gave up everything to me. I have the entire business now, and it\r\nleaves me little unoccupied time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are doing well, I trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reasonably well.\" I knew the look on his heavy, sombre face--a patient\r\nbut combative look, powerful as Fate itself.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind telling me the rest, Jack?\" I asked after a time. \"If it\r\nhurts you don't open your lips.\"\r\n\r\nThe veins in his forehead swelled a little, yet he neither flinched nor\r\nreddened. \"I suppose,\" he answered, his voice a little less clear and\r\ndistinct, \"you allude to my engagement to Miss Lenox. It was broken off\r\nwhen these troubles came. We were to have been married a year ago in\r\nJune, but I was not quite free to take her travelling, and it seemed her\r\nwish to wait. The wedding-day was quite fixed for a fortnight after the\r\ndate of my poor father's sickness. Of course I offered her her freedom\r\nat once when I realized my scanty prospects of ensuring her a luxurious\r\nfuture. Naturally, everything was broken off. I am hampered by\r\ncircumstances. I shall never feel myself free to live even in ordinary\r\ncomfort until my father's debts are paid to the last penny. My first\r\nduty is to my father and mother. My sisters are all married, have large\r\nfamilies, and, above all, have lost the home feeling. We three are alone\r\nin the world in our reverses. When you see our home, Floyd, you won't\r\nwonder that I could not ask Georgy to come to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would she have come, Jack?\" I stammered. \"Was she faithful to you?\r\nwould she not wait for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgy is not romantic,\" he said kindly, \"and has not been brought up\r\nin a school which inspires the tenderest feelings. I should never have\r\nexpected that sort of devotion from her, nor am I one to inspire it. I\r\nknew at once when the dark days came that everything was over. Blow\r\nafter blow had struck me: just at that time that she should desert me\r\nwas but one blow the more.\"\r\n\r\nI threw my arm about him in the old way, but he did not turn now and\r\nsmile into my face as when we were boys. This gloom was not so easily\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nHe himself ended the silence that I could not bring myself to break. \"I\r\nhave heard of a divided duty, but I can have no doubts, no dilemmas, as\r\nto mine. I believe that I am not fanciful--that I see realities just as\r\nthey are. If ever man found work lying close to his hands, I have found\r\nit. If ever an entire and undivided responsibility rested upon human\r\ncreature, it is mine. Every instinct of my heart, every decision of my\r\nintellect, alike shows me that my duty lies in the path which I am\r\ntreading. Nobody on earth, nobody but God, knows just exactly what I\r\nhave felt the few past months. I couldn't write to you and Harry. Life\r\nhad always been a pleasant thing to me. My father was not a lovable man,\r\nnor was he in his home all that a son longs for in a father. Still, he\r\nwas rich and respected; he represented a beneficent financial power; he\r\ncontrolled many interests, developed resources, carried out schemes\r\nwhich were useful alike to poor and rich. I used to be proud to hear it\r\nsaid, 'That is young Holt, son of Adam Holt of the ---- Mills.' Now I am\r\nobliged to bear with meekness, when he is called dishonest, when he is\r\nclassed with those who have suffered the punishment of convicted felons,\r\nwhen his pitiful infirmity of body and mind is sneered at. We are living\r\nin our house as transient guests: as soon as it can be sold we shall\r\nseek some humbler shelter. The pleasant household ways are all gone:\r\neverything that used to gladden our eyes has been carried away. My\r\nmother's eyes rest nowhere save on my father's face or mine: she cannot\r\nlook at the bare places in the house, for she thinks too much then of\r\nher great calamity. All these are troubles which cut me deep: you don't\r\nknow, Floyd, how disgrace burns into the soul--worse than bereavement,\r\nworse than death. I have been bereaved of all, and I seem to have tasted\r\nthe bitterness of a thousand deaths. Still\"--he turned abruptly and\r\nlooked me in the eyes with a stiff white face--\"there are times when I\r\nfeel but one loss. There is strength in me, and, please God, by and by I\r\nshall shape things to their right ends again; but this other loss! I\r\ndon't need to tell you,\" he went on huskily, \"how above and beyond all\r\nother objects on earth Georgy Lenox has been to me. At times,\r\nretrievement, success, unsullied honor, all seem to me as nothing, since\r\nshe is not to be at the end of them.\"\r\n\r\nWe had reached the factories now, and he resumed his usual calmness, and\r\nI could see in a moment that he was a business-man again. He asked me to\r\nstay and drive back with him, and dine and spend the night, urging it\r\non the plea that his mother would like to see me--that she had so few\r\npleasures. I consented against my wish, almost against my will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one knows what change means, what frightful possibilities of sadness\r\nit covers, until one has such an experience as mine that night. In\r\nformer times the Holt house had been a sort of fairyland to me: our own\r\nmenage was simple and inexpensive, and, in contrast, the profusion and\r\nsplendor of Jack's home had impressed me powerfully. Their expenditure\r\nwas not moderated by what we call good taste, and they did not possess\r\nthat fine grace of compassing elegance without ostentation which is one\r\nof the last results of culture; but as a boy I had missed nothing that\r\nmoney could buy in their house, and I had often thought how my mother\r\nwould shine there. Mr. Holt had been a man to look up to with respect,\r\nalthough somewhat arrogant and dictatorial, and Mrs. Holt--good, easy\r\nsoul!--had enjoyed her prosperity with an equal pride and joy in her\r\nhusband, her children, her silver plate, her heavy silks and her jewels,\r\nwhich, displayed in their satin cases, were the chief show in Belfield\r\nfor the women, who used to tiptoe up the grand staircase to Mrs. Holt's\r\ndressing-room, and come down with awe in their faces.\r\n\r\nMrs. Holt at this later time I write of was a sad, soft-eyed little\r\nwoman, with a patient smile: she was so much of a lady that her dress\r\nwas neat and pleasing, although of the plainest. She kissed me when I\r\nwent in with Jack, and I felt like going on my knees before her. She\r\ntreated Jack as if he were older than herself, although with the utmost\r\ntenderness qualifying the respect she gave him; but I was a boy to her\r\nstill, and she looked lovingly in my face and told me that she knew I\r\nwas a comfort to my mother. I had been a good deal of a man in my own\r\neyes in Europe, but in these familiar places I did not feel much older\r\nthan I had done six years before, full-grown although I was, and so\r\ntall that I had to stoop very low to meet the little woman's kiss.\r\n\r\n\"Here is father,\" said Mrs. Holt in a tender, cooing voice; and she went\r\nup to a feeble old man in an arm-chair and began telling him that this\r\nwas Floyd come back--Floyd Randolph, whom he used to like so well years\r\nago. Mr. Holt looked at me with hopeless, bleared eyes, and shook his\r\nhead and complained in mumbling tones that dinner was not ready, that\r\nnobody took care of him, that he was neglected by wife and son.\r\n\r\nJack himself led his father to the table, and it was a hard task to\r\nguide the tottering footsteps, but not so hard perhaps as for the poor\r\nwife to tend him while he ate as if he were a baby. There are sad things\r\nupon which one may dwell, for some sorrows bring sweetness with them,\r\nand give meaning and perfume to a life, just as the night is almost\r\nlovelier in its shadows than the garish day; but I cannot write about\r\nJack's troubles, for it was so pitiful to me to see this strong man so\r\nfretted, so bound, by the fine chains which duty sometimes forges for\r\nmen. The meal we ate was of the poorest, but I think there is no\r\nbitterness in bearing personal deprivation, and I did not pity Jack that\r\nneither the taste of the palate nor the taste of the eye could be\r\ngratified at his board; but when I saw him playing backgammon with his\r\nfather afterward I did pity him. The old man's hand shook so that his\r\nwife had to guide his wrist as he threw the dice, and he burst into\r\nsenile tears if the throw did not suit him. But Jack was hopeful and\r\ncordial through it all, and would patiently tell his father little\r\ntrifles of news about his business, and engage his attention so kindly\r\nthat once or twice the heavy fallen features would almost gather\r\nexpression again. At such times happy tears would start to Mrs. Holt's\r\neyes. \"I do believe father's getting better,\" she would say, looking at\r\nher son.\r\n\r\nIt was still early, however, when Jack and I were left alone. He had\r\ncarried the poor old man to bed, and now for a few hours the burden had\r\nfallen from the son.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go out and walk about the old places,\" said he. \"The house is\r\ndreary, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only thought of you all, Jack,\" was my answer. \"My dreariness\r\nhas not been induced by the look of the house. Still, when I do look\r\naround and see the rich carpets gone, the pictures, statues, all the\r\nthousand beautiful things we used to take pleasure in, I say to myself,\r\n'This just man will have his reward.' Don't despond, Jack: I tell you,\r\nthings will come right again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Floyd,\" said he in his cool way. \"I am better for having\r\nseen you. But let us talk of something besides my troubles to-night. It\r\nis a sweet evening.\"\r\n\r\nHe took my arm, and we walked out along the avenue into the street. It\r\nwas a beautiful night, calm and warm, with a full moon shining down upon\r\nthe deserted squares. We went up the hill and stood on the steps of the\r\nacademy, then sat down upon a bench on the playground beneath the\r\npoplars, and found our initials there where we had cut them years\r\nbefore. Missing Dart in these old familiar places, it was natural for us\r\nto talk of him, for, well as Jack loved me, Harry was his dearest\r\nfriend. A peculiar tenderness had always knit their hearts together, and\r\nit had been another sorrow to Holt that in all his trouble his cousin\r\nwas too far away to give him a glance of his eyes, a grip of his strong\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI told him all I knew of Harry. We had not been mistaken in our estimate\r\nof his genius: he had not been in Rome three months before the famous\r\nZ----had become interested in him and allowed him to study in his\r\natelier. Every one predicted success for the young artist, and dealers\r\nwere already beginning to buy up his pictures, paying a mere song for\r\nstudies to-day which years hence they expected to sell for a big sum on\r\nthe strength of the reputation he would have gained. Harry's strong\r\npoints were his unequalled distinctness of vision and his intensity of\r\nfeeling for art. He put a passionate throb into every movement of his\r\nbrush. When once an idea occurred to him as desirable to work out, it\r\ndefined itself to his imagination with a reality, a power, an amplitude\r\nof detail, which blinded him for the time being to everything else, and\r\nhe worked so faithfully that he stamped his conception and his meaning\r\nupon not only every figure, but every accessory of his picture; so that\r\nthe most commonplace observer gazed at his canvas with some of the same\r\nfeeling with which he gazed at an experience of life. But Z---- was not\r\nyet satisfied to have him attempt compositions, and he was spending much\r\ntime over the curious processes by which the perfection of skill in art\r\nis attained--productive analyses of coloring, light, shadow and the\r\nmellowed harmonies of time-worn pictures.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be proud of Harry by and by,\" said Holt as I paused. \"I hope\r\nhe won't stay too long abroad. I have missed you so, Floyd!\" And we fell\r\nto telling stories of our boyhood, and again and again Jack's laugh\r\nbroke the silence of the night, for there were droll tales to tell. We\r\nheard the chimes of midnight before we stirred from our seat, and then\r\nwe moved with some reluctance, for the moonlight was rare, and the light\r\nupon the water where the sea-line showed through the interstices of the\r\ntrees was a silvery radiance too blessed to lose. But at last we rose\r\nand moved carelessly homeward. We did not take the nearest way, but\r\nturned as with one intention through another street than that by which\r\nwe came. Our feet knew the way to a little Gothic cottage on the hill,\r\nand we stood outside silently for a time. No sight or sound of any\r\ncreature stirring in the world but ourselves met eyes or ears. No light\r\nwas in the windows, and the blinds of a casement beneath the gable were\r\nclose drawn. I wondered if a white hand had closed them a few hours\r\nbefore, and if a fair sleep-flushed face and bright disordered hair lay\r\non the pillow inside. Just then some bird, brooding over her three eggs\r\nin her nest, stirred drowsily and cooed softly at some delicious dream\r\nof love or maternity. It broke the spell, and we turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fancy,\" said Jack, \"that this is a habit of mine. I have not been\r\nhere before since December.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea. I never hear her name, and when I am in church I never\r\nturn to look.\"\r\n\r\nI left Belfield early the next morning, and pursued my way to The\r\nHeadlands. I had many thoughts of Jack as I went on, wondering if this\r\ncruel and irremediable wrong which Fate had inflicted was to shadow all\r\nhis life. Indeed, I felt disheartened, for I had warm sympathies; and\r\nbesides, the cruel prose of his experience broke upon the easy,\r\npleasure-loving harmony of my life like the sudden crash of kettledrums\r\nin the midst of moribund flute melody. I had always possessed too much\r\nleisure not to have become saddened and perplexed at times with doubts\r\nbefore the eternal problem of life; and they all returned now, and not\r\nuntil I reached The Headlands in the late afternoon did I rouse myself\r\ninto an anticipation of the pleasant life I was to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was not expected: no one met me at the station, and, finding no\r\nconveyance, I walked on myself to the place, and entered the grounds not\r\nmore than an hour before sunset. Everything was curiously calm and at\r\npeace except the breakers, which moaned against the rocks below as the\r\ntide came in. The shadows were long upon the grass, and looked like\r\nthings that had felt life all day, but now had coiled themselves up for\r\nsleep. Beyond the trees the fiery sun still shone, gilding the stately\r\nhouse with gold and resting lovingly upon the roses which clambered\r\nriotously over embrasures and abutments, lighting up the piazzas and\r\ncolumns with their bloom. I recognized a change at once in the aspect of\r\nthe place: more windows and doors were open than formerly, and the\r\nporticoes showed signs of careless occupancy with their chairs and\r\nafghans, tables and a litter of books, papers and work. I stood before\r\nthe door, gazing through the wide-columned vista of the hall, and the\r\ninfinite seemed open before my eyes as I saw the blue and opal-tinted\r\nsea. But still there was no sound except the murmur from the shore, and\r\nnothing stirred except the sunbeams as they climbed the carved\r\nbalustrade of the great staircase and gleamed on the frozen faces of a\r\nmarble group in a niche. I did not ring at first, for it seemed as if my\r\nmother or Helen must come out--that they were close at hand, picking\r\nroses on the terrace or descending from their rooms. But it was Mills\r\nwho presently issued from the dining-room and saw me. He greeted me as\r\nif I were one of the family, and ushered me into the library as he had\r\ndone at the time of my first visit years before.\r\n\r\nSitting there quietly, I seemed for the first time to realize the fact\r\nof old Mr. Raymond's death. I saw his chair by the fireplace, and the\r\nlow seat on which Helen and I had sat together many and many a time. I\r\nhad not grieved at the old man's death, but had felt that weeping for\r\nthe dead might sometimes be a less dreary task than bearing with the\r\nliving; yet here I could not see these beautiful inanimate things, once\r\nhis intimate surroundings, without a thrill of regret that he was gone.\r\n\r\nA shadow fell across the doorway, and a young girl came in, one of the\r\nsunset gleams reflected from some of the endless mirrors of the house\r\nfalling on her and lighting up her face. My first thought was, \"She is\r\nalmost a woman:\" my second was, \"I had never expected she would be so\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not spoken yet: she ran up to me eagerly and looked into my face,\r\nand I clasped her hands. When I saw that she was crying there seemed to\r\nme but one way of greeting the child. I took her in my arms and kissed\r\nher. It seemed strange, I think, to neither of us that we should meet in\r\nthis way. But when we looked at each other now, I felt a curious glow\r\nover my face, and she hung her head and was blushing vividly, as I had\r\nnever suspected the pale little Helen I had once known so well, with her\r\naspect of almost severe purity, could ever blush. There was a new sort\r\nof beauty about her: a soft richness of tint and texture seemed added to\r\ncheek and lip, and the old imperious concentration of her glance was,\r\nfor the moment, quite gone. Still, although I could easily see that she\r\nwas frightened at her own temerity in allowing my more than brotherly\r\nfreedom, I could not find it in my heart to repent it.\r\n\r\n\"Where is my mother, Helen?\" I asked, taking her hand in mine to\r\nreassure her, for I saw that something was embarrassing her very much.\r\n\"It seems I was not expected to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so late as this,\" she explained; and presently I was talking freely\r\nwith her, and she was listening without a particle of self-consciousness\r\nin her manner. It appeared that my mother and Mr. Floyd had gone out to\r\ndrive, but would presently return to tea--that my mother had been\r\nlonging for me, and they had all wondered why I had delayed coming. This\r\nwas all very pleasant, uttered in the sweetest voice by my young\r\nhostess, and when she asked me if I would go out and see the sunset from\r\nthe terrace, it was very easy to say that I would follow her anywhere.\r\n\r\nShe was a shy child still, I discovered, despite her tall figure, her\r\npretty womanly shape and elegant air. My manhood was too recent a\r\npossession not to be rejoiced in when I saw that a woman's blushes came\r\nand went as she felt the weight of my glance. We went out of doors and\r\nsaw the surges breaking on the shore, but the waves seemed happy that\r\nnight, and lisped joyfully like children at their play. There was no\r\nvoice of sorrow in all Nature: the birds circling about their nests\r\nbegan glad strains, then hushed them only to break forth again into\r\nfresh confused and joyful beginnings which they were too sleepy to\r\nfinish. We talked of sorrow and loss, yet I think neither of us was very\r\nsorrowful, although Helen's tears flowed unchecked as she poured forth\r\nthe simple narrative of her grandfather's last days--how he had never\r\nbeen so tender, so self-forgetful, as then; how he could not do enough\r\nto show his deep love for her; and then how, in the night, all at once,\r\nwithout a last look, word or caress, he was gone and his tenderness was\r\nbut a memory.\r\n\r\n\"I felt at first,\" said Helen, \"as if there were no longer anything for\r\nme to do in the world. It seemed a treason to poor grandpa that I saw\r\nhow beautiful the crocuses were as they blossomed in the beds on the\r\nterrace here, and when the mayflowers came I did not dare to pick them\r\nexcept to put them on his grave. Then, you know, as not even papa knows,\r\nthat with all my reverence for my grandfather I had still had a terrible\r\nsense of responsibility mingled with my love for him; and not even yet\r\ncan I go out a few hours for a drive or a ride without my feeling every\r\nnow and then, through all my pleasure with papa, a sudden pang of dread.\r\nAfter such times I run to his room: it is easy enough to believe then\r\nthat he no longer has any need of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were all alone at first, Helen, until my mother came to you? Two\r\nweeks alone! It seems dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgy Lenox was here, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgy Lenox here?\" I echoed in surprise. \"I never heard anything so\r\nstrange. How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\nHelen looked at me in her turn in astonishment. \"Why was it strange?\"\r\nshe asked, as if regarding the matter in a new light. \"She was one of\r\nthe family: she came to grandpapa's funeral. Cousin Charles Raymond\r\nhimself invited all the Lenoxes, for Mr. Lenox's mother was a\r\nRaymond--was grandpa's own sister, I believe. Why was it strange?\"\r\n\r\n\"Natural for her to come perhaps, but I should not have expected her to\r\nremain. You asked her, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No-o-o,\" returned Helen doubtfully. \"I don't know how it was. The house\r\nwas filled with people for a week: then they went away and Georgy\r\nstayed. She said it was horrid for me to have no lady near me in my\r\ntrouble. Cousin Charles was here all the time until your mother came,\r\nbut his wife was ill in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when my mother arrived Georgy left you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed: she is still here. You see,\" said Helen with a little of\r\nher old imperious way when she took control of things, \"Georgy was\r\ngreatly disappointed at the terms of the will. She had been led to\r\nexpect that she would be quite an heiress when grandpa died. I don't\r\nknow who taught her to believe in so strange an idea, for, to tell the\r\ntruth, grandpapa did not fancy Georgy. Poor girl! everything has gone\r\nwrong with her. She was to have been married to Mr. Holt, you know, but\r\nit is all quite broken off; and she was very unhappy about that. She\r\nhates being in Belfield, because she sees him all the time, and is\r\nreminded of what she is trying to forget. So I asked her to stay here\r\nfor a little while. You are not angry to find her here, Floyd?\"\r\n\r\nI laughed with an indefinable feeling of embarrassment. \"I shall be most\r\nhappy to see Miss Lenox,\" I rejoined; \"and if I were not, it would be\r\ngreat impertinence in me to question for a moment the doings of the lady\r\nof the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not the lady of the house,\" said she, a little piqued. \"Mrs.\r\nRandolph is that. I give no orders now: everybody goes to papa. He says\r\nI have governed too long, and that I must be a little girl again. It\r\nseems so strange sometimes to have nobody consult me: I do nothing all\r\nday long but enjoy myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I belong to the old regime,\" said I, \"and to me you will always be\r\nthe chatelaine. I remember how you used to give orders to Mills and Mrs.\r\nBlack: I can still smell the aromatic odors of the store-room when we\r\nused to make the weekly survey together, and can hear you talking\r\n'horse' solemnly with the coachman down at the stables. I am not at all\r\nsure if I shall like you so well as a gay young lady of pleasure, with\r\nall your thoughts on your dresses and your lovers.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if I should ever think about my dresses or my lovers!\" she replied\r\nwith deep disdain.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think about papa,\" she rejoined, still indignantly: \"I think about\r\nyour mother and you. I have a great many nice things to think about\r\nwithout being taken up with those horrid subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Horrid subjects'! Good gracious!\" I exclaimed: \"I intend some day to\r\nbe somebody's lover: shall I be a 'horrid subject'?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed frankly, a delightful girlish laugh which showed her little\r\npearly teeth. \"It depends on how you behave,\" she said with a little\r\nnod. \"Georgy Lenox has lovers: she tells me about them, and I think them\r\nhorrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they come to the house here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. One is a stout man with a red face. He wears a solitaire\r\ndiamond in his necktie. Papa knows him: he was in Congress, and his name\r\nis Judge Talbot. Then there is a young man--not so young as you, but\r\nstill young. He remembers you: he used to be in Belfield. He is Mr.\r\nThorpe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tony Thorpe here? What unlikely people I come across! Which is Miss\r\nLenox's favorite admirer?\"\r\n\r\n\"As if she would have favorites among such admirers! Georgy is the most\r\nbeautiful girl in the world. Papa is not fond of her, but even he says\r\nshe is a superb creature. Why does nobody like Georgy? Papa does not,\r\nand I am sure Mrs. Randolph does not, nor do you. Yet she is so\r\nbeautiful, so winning, so clever!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to pity her for not gaining love,\" said I gravely. \"My\r\nmother may not like her, because she knew her as a faulty child who did\r\nconsiderable mischief first and last; and Mr. Floyd dislikes her\r\nbecause--You know why he dislikes her, Helen. But many people love her:\r\nI think few women in the world have won so much devotion. I have just\r\nseen Jack Holt, who had to give her up, and I am far from believing that\r\nnobody likes her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did he give her up?\" questioned Helen.\r\n\r\n\"Why did she give him up,\" I returned with heat, \"except that he had\r\nlost his fortune, and instead of being able to endow her with all the\r\ngood things of life, himself needed aid, sympathy, love and comfort?\"\r\n\r\nHelen stared at me: \"But he told Georgy she was free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said I passionately, \"that a man had loved you from your\r\nearliest childhood, Helen--that instead of your being possessed of\r\nwealth and other facilities for making your life all you wished, you\r\nwere poor and obscure, and this man had made every sacrifice to gratify\r\nevery desire of your heart. Suppose you had read his soul like a printed\r\npage, and found every thought in it noble, lofty and pure; suppose you\r\nknew that his happiness depended on you--that without you he could not\r\nhave one sacred personal hope,--when you found that he was poor instead\r\nof rich, would you throw him over as you put away a glove that is worn\r\nout, even though he told you you were free--that although you had shared\r\nhis prosperity he shrank from letting you endure the pains of his\r\nadversity?\"\r\n\r\nHelen was looking at me with a curious look in her brilliant dark eyes,\r\nand still watched me when I paused.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have accepted such freedom?\" I demanded, impatient that she\r\ndid not respond.\r\n\r\n\"I would have died for him!\" she exclaimed abruptly, but she said no\r\nmore about Georgy or her lovers.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set, and the glory of the clouds was all reflected in the\r\nsea. The air grew chilly, and we went in and watched at the front door\r\nfor Mr. Floyd and my mother to return from their drive. It seemed\r\ncuriously like the old times, and once or twice I started at some sound,\r\nexpecting to hear a querulous voice and see old Mr. Raymond with his fur\r\nwrappings crossing the hall leaning on Frederick, who carried his\r\ntiger-skin. Helen was too quick and sympathetic not to understand my\r\nstartled look.\r\n\r\n\"He will never come any more,\" said she sadly. \"He is sleeping up on the\r\nhill beside his wife and all his children. Had it not been for papa I\r\nshould have felt that I must go there too, it seemed so strange and\r\nlonely for him.\"\r\n\r\nPresently through the pale gloaming came my mother from her drive, and\r\nwhen I lifted her from the carriage and almost bore her up the steps in\r\nmy arms, I felt a happiness and peace which seemed but the beginning of\r\na blessed time. My mother had grown perhaps a little older in the last\r\ntwo years, but surely she had grown more beautiful. It was enough at\r\nfirst merely to look into her face: then when I followed her up to her\r\nroom we told each other many, many things, but I invite none to follow\r\nme over that threshold.\r\n\r\n\"I took good care of your boy, Mary,\" said Mr. Floyd, coming up to us\r\nwhen we descended; and when I met my mother's look I felt again all the\r\nproud humility that a son can feel, beloved as I was beloved.\r\n\r\n\"He was not such a bad boy,\" pursued Mr. Floyd, ringing the bell and\r\nordering tea, \"and his faults, such as they were, belonged to his\r\nage.--Don't open your eyes, Helen, as if you expected to hear just what\r\nhe did. I shall not betray him. All the world knows that when one is\r\nabroad one may commit enormities which there may be put inside your\r\nsleeve, while here they are as big as a meeting-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe Floyd did anything wicked,\" remarked Helen with some\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\"We are at home now, Floyd,\" pursued he with an air of resignation, \"and\r\nour little diversions are over. The eyes of two women are upon us. No\r\nmore cakes and ale--nothing but rectitude, cold water, naps in the\r\nevening. I forgot, though, about our charming guest. While Miss Lenox is\r\nhere ginger will be hot i' the mouth, and life will have a slight flavor\r\nof wickedness still.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is Miss Lenox?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lenox is far too brilliant a young lady to stay constantly in a\r\ndull country-house,\" said Mr. Floyd. \"The cottage people over at the\r\nPoint _raffolent_, as our friends abroad say, upon the charming Miss\r\nGeorgina. We have, after all, very little of her society. She goes on\r\nyachting-parties, to dinners, luncheons, picnics--everywhere, in fact,\r\nwhere the delicate lavender ribbons of slight mourning may be allowed.\r\nShe has attended a dejeuner to-day, and we are every moment expecting\r\nthat our gates of pearl will unclose and admit a celestial visitant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, papa,\" said Helen, \"you shall not make fun of Georgy. Nobody does\r\nher justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they?\" returned Mr. Floyd dryly. \"_Fiat justitia_, then! _Ruat\r\ncaelum!_ One would follow the other in this case, I fear.--She generally,\r\nFloyd, brings home one or two in her train. You remember Antonio Thorpe?\r\nThat young man is so often here that I am beginning to regard him as one\r\nof the regular drawbacks to existence, like draughts, indigestion, bills\r\nand other annoyances outrageously opposed to all our ideas of comfort,\r\nyet inevitable and to be borne with as good grace as may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is Tony doing at the Point?\"\r\n\r\n\"He dresses well,\" returned Mr. Floyd reflectively: \"his hands are soft,\r\nhis nails clean. I don't think he follows any occupation which demands\r\nmanual labor. I can generally tell a man's business by his hands or his\r\ncoat; but on Tony's irreproachable broadcloth not one shiny seam\r\ndiscloses what particular grist-mill he turns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he has no grist-mill,\" said Helen. \"I thought he was a man of\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was the guardian of his youth,\" observed Mr. Floyd, \"and when he was\r\ntwenty-one I paid over to him intact the sum of money left to him by his\r\nfather. It had originally been less than fifteen hundred dollars, but by\r\nlying untouched for nine years at compound interest it had nearly\r\ndoubled. That was several years ago, and with the utmost frugality on\r\nhis part I can't see how he could have worn such decent coats on the\r\ninterest of that money all this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you put him into business half a dozen times,\" interposed my\r\nmother: \"I suppose he made money.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he never made any money. The only way Tony will make money honestly\r\nis by marrying a rich girl. Not that I assume him to be dishonest or a\r\nsharper, for I do think him a gentleman, after the fashion of Sir\r\nFopling. He probably is considerably in debt, but floats himself from\r\nall danger of sinking by speculation or the like. Five times I set him\r\nat work to make his living: five times he was returned on my hands. His\r\ncharacter possesses all the drawbacks of great genius, without any of\r\nits resources: he is proud, discontented, misunderstood, with a talent\r\nfor failure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he a suitor of Miss Lenox's?\" I asked. \"He was never in the habit of\r\nadmiring her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can make up your mind,\" said Mr. Floyd with a shrug, thus\r\ndismissing the subject.--\"Helen, my child, looking at this young man\r\nimpartially and judicially, what do you think of him?\" and he put his\r\nhand on my shoulder.\r\n\r\nWe were at tea, which was always an informal meal at The Headlands.\r\nHelen sat among the tea-cups, my mother had a little table by her sofa,\r\nand Mr. Floyd and I walked about carrying cream and sugar and cakes. I\r\nwas on my way for a fresh cup when this question was put, and I went up\r\nto Helen and sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Impartially and judicially,\" said I, \"what do you think of me?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd took his seat on the other side of her, put his face close to\r\nhers and began to whisper all sorts of nonsense in her ear about me.\r\n\"Tell him,\" said he, \"to begin with, that he is a prig.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know what a prig is.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prig is a handsome fellow born to create disturbance among the\r\nladies.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked around at me and laughed. \"Isn't he a goose?\" she asked in a\r\npretended whisper. \"Where was it in Europe that he lost his brains? He\r\nhas brought none of them home.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may have been at Damascus,\" said Mr. Floyd. \"Did I tell you that\r\nafter I fell through the trapdoor in Damascus and broke my ribs, they\r\nput a railing about the place and asked a piastre for a look at the spot\r\nwhere the American gentleman almost came to an untimely end?\"\r\n\r\nBut Helen did not laugh: she put her arm about his neck and brought his\r\ncheek to her lip, and kept it there, giving it mute caresses now and\r\nthen, while she smoothed his hair about his temples with her little\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take some more tea, if you please,\" remarked Mr. Floyd after a\r\nwhile in a meek voice.--\"I'm obliged to endure a good deal of this sort\r\nof thing, my boy: it's not so unpleasant as it may look, but\r\nnevertheless it requires some stimulant to keep up an emotion of\r\nagreeable surprise. By the bye, what do you think of my little girl, now\r\nthat she is quite grown up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare to tell,\" said Helen. \"I'm dreadfully vain all at once, for\r\npapa flatters me so that the rugged courtesy of the outside world would\r\nseem hard to me. Still, papa's compliments count for very little. When\r\nGeorgy comes in presently just listen to what he says to her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd precisely at this juncture there was a little commotion in the hall,\r\nand Miss Lenox did come in with Tony Thorpe. She had spoken to my\r\nmother, kissed Helen and answered Mr. Floyd's badinage before she saw\r\nme, yet when her eyes did turn toward me she showed no surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Have you come at last?\" she inquired coolly, holding out her hand. \"I\r\nam glad to see you again, Mr. Randolph.\"\r\n\r\nI greeted her as calmly, and said, \"How are you, Thorpe?\" to her\r\ncompanion, with another shake of the hand. And then everybody sat down,\r\nand there was fresh tea brought. I noticed that Thorpe was quite\r\nassiduous in his attentions to Helen over the cups and saucers, and\r\nseemed as much at home in the house as a tame spaniel. Meanwhile, Miss\r\nLenox had sat down by my mother and begun telling her the events of the\r\nday. The dejeuner had been given on a yacht in the bay, and had begun in\r\nmistake and ended in disaster: the wrong people had come, while the\r\nright ones had been kept away, like the invited guests in the Gospel.\r\nThe sun had been too warm, the breeze too cool, the men who talked to\r\nher garrulous and stupid, and the women abominably over-dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Helen,\" cried Georgy with effusion, \"I have wished myself at home\r\nwith you all day.--Dear Mrs. Randolph, tell me what you have been doing\r\nwith yourselves;\" and she wasted a slight caress on my mother.\r\n\r\n\"Our doings were nothing remarkable in themselves,\" said my mother\r\ngently, with a little smile--one of those smiles which women keep for\r\nuse among themselves, and rarely give to men.\r\n\r\n\"Papa and Mrs. Randolph and I sat under a tree until dinner-time,\" said\r\nHelen. \"We have been very idle, but had a delightful time nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Praying all the time that Miss Lenox was enjoying herself at the\r\ndejeuner,\" drawled Mr. Floyd.\r\n\r\nGeorgy had risen and was crossing the room, and now, passing Mr. Floyd,\r\npaused and looked down into his face as he surveyed her with a slightly\r\nsatirical air.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of anybody's prayers,\" she returned, quite unruffled, \"but I\r\nam afraid, Mr. Floyd, yours are merely a pretty figure of speech.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd suddenly sprang to his feet and walked up and down the room\r\nwith a restless way he had. \"I have it! I have it!\" he exclaimed with a\r\ntriumphant air. \"It is a picture of a Wili of whom you remind me, Miss\r\nLenox. I saw it in R----'s studio at Rome.--Don't you remember it,\r\nFloyd?\"\r\n\r\nI knew it very well, and was aware, besides, that R---- had got the face\r\nfrom Dart's sketch-book.\r\n\r\n\"What is a Wili?\" inquired Georgy, looking at me. \"You know I used to go\r\nto you for all my bits of knowledge when I was a little girl, Mr.\r\nRandolph.\"\r\n\r\nI rose and crossed the room to her side. \"A Wili,\" said I, \"is a\r\nbetrothed maiden who dies before her wedding-day. Your knowledge of your\r\nsex may tell you why it is that she is never at peace in her grave, but\r\nis impelled by some unconquerable love of life to rise every night and\r\ndance till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"With whom does she dance? Her unfortunate lover?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where Wilis live you see them dancing together in the woods and\r\nfields by moonlight and starlight, their white arms wreathed about each\r\nother and their long hair floating. When a Wili meets a youth abroad in\r\nthe night-time she beseeches him to dance with her; and the voice of the\r\nWili is so sweet, her eyes so terribly beautiful, her clasp so horribly\r\nclose, that whether he will or not he must join the fatal dance and keep\r\npace with her eager, frenzied movements. When morning comes the Wili has\r\ngone back to her grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is the young man?\" asked Georgy.\r\n\r\n\"They find him dead on the grass,\" put in Thorpe, who was standing\r\nbehind Helen's chair. \"It is death to dance with a Wili.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both of you seem very experienced young men,\" remarked Miss Lenox\r\ncalmly. \"Did either of you ever meet with a Wili?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have frequently met them on flowering meads,\" I returned, laughing,\r\n\"but when they invite me to dance I tell them I am unable to dance with\r\neven the prettiest of live women, I am such a miserable cripple.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather a pretty story,\" mused Georgy, \"but I don't quite see what\r\nit means.--Do you, Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be a sort of warning to young men to keep in o' nights,\"\r\nreturned Helen with a droll little air.\r\n\r\n\"Dead women never trouble me,\" said Thorpe, \"but I have had no end of\r\ncharming dances with live ones.--Do you waltz, Miss Floyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Miss Lenox and I waltz together whenever we can get any one to\r\nplay for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be a tame amusement,\" rejoined Thorpe with an ineffable air\r\nof conceit.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the neat compliment,\" said Georgy, \"but neither Miss Floyd\r\nnor myself suffer from the tameness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, allow me to explain--\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not so dull but that we can understand even the most stupid\r\nbungle at a compliment of any awkward man,\" yawned Georgy. \"Some time,\r\nby and by, when I am very rich, and so old that I don't care what\r\nhappens nor how I offend my admirers, I intend to give to the world a\r\nwoman's opinion upon the fascinations of men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! I hope I may live a hundred or so years in order to hear it,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Floyd. \"However, Miss Georgy, it would be safe enough for you\r\nto tell us now that you hold men contemptible, only practising your\r\ncoquetries upon them for your own amusement, quite indifferent whether\r\nyour shafts hit or go astray. We could bear the ordeal, for we should\r\nknow very well that circumstances must vindicate us. We are, after all,\r\nsuperior to even the highest simian types, and our poor fascinations\r\nshine by comparison with those of even the most intelligent baboon; so\r\nwe should be certain that, in spite of your opinion of us, you would go\r\non making yourself beautiful for our approbation to the end of your\r\nlife, because you have, in fact, no other object worth spending your\r\nenergies upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said Georgy, with a peculiar glance at Mr. Floyd, \"some men\r\nare worth any effort.\"\r\n\r\nThorpe, after many vain attempts to engage Helen in conversation, took\r\nhis leave, and when I went to the door with him he begged me to stroll\r\ndown the grounds to the gate. He had a three-mile walk before him for\r\nhis pains in coming home in the carriage with Miss Lenox, but he vowed\r\nthat the pleasure he always found at The Headlands recompensed him for\r\nany labor. He burst into enthusiastic talk about the old times at\r\nBelfield: he remembered the charm of my mother's house, he said, and the\r\ngood times we boys had enjoyed together. How was Holt now-a-days? and\r\nwhere was Dart? Was it true that Jack himself had thrown Miss Lenox\r\nover, or was the fault on her side? \"She is much admired,\" he went on.\r\n\"How do you think her looking? She has many lovers and two or three\r\nsuitors. There is Judge Talbot, with his mind set on winning her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What category of her admirers do you come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am neither lover nor suitor,\" he rejoined lightly. \"Miss Lenox and I\r\nare on excellent terms of camaraderie--no more. Were I to admire any\r\nwoman from my heart, it would be the one I have just left. Is she not\r\nthe rarest, sweetest, dearest Lady Disdain in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot guess to whom you refer,\" said I, \"for I am at a loss how to\r\nexcuse the familiarity of your speech in reference to any lady in the\r\nhouse except Miss Lenox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Randolph,\" exclaimed Thorpe, putting his hand on my shoulder, \"you\r\nshall not bluff me off so. I would cut my tongue out before I used it\r\ntoo freely in praising a young lady like Miss Floyd. I knew her as a\r\nchild: her father is my best friend, my benefactor. Remember, if I spoke\r\ntoo freely, that my Southern blood gives me more trouble than the chilly\r\ncurrents in your Northern veins.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke so eagerly, and with such perfect temper, that I was ashamed of\r\nmy momentary outburst. I shook hands with him cordially at the gate, and\r\nwalked back slowly, looking at the heavy bank of fog lying in the east\r\nover which the moon was peering, and thinking of my mother, of Helen,\r\nperhaps a little of Georgy, although my heart was swelling with anger\r\ntoward her still: so I told myself again and again. Yet how beautiful\r\nshe was, with a new and bewildering tenderness in her manner! What had\r\nsoftened her? Was it suffering?\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the parlor she had gone up stairs, tired with her\r\nexcursion, I heard, and longing for a night's rest. I sat down by my\r\nmother, and we talked until midnight, while Helen sang ballads to her\r\nfather in the next room in a rare contralto voice which had gained\r\nstrength and richness since I heard it last.\r\n\r\nWhen, finally, Mr. Floyd--who always put off going to bed as a final\r\nnecessity--allowed me to go up stairs, I found inside my dressing-case a\r\nfolded paper on which these lines were written: \"The prettiest hour of\r\nthe day at The Headlands is at seven o'clock in the morning, down among\r\nthe rocks.\"\r\n\r\nI should have felt no doubt whose hand had put the notelet there even if\r\nit had failed to breathe the perfume of violets, which no one who knew\r\nGeorgy Lenox could hesitate to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was full two o'clock before I began to think of sleeping, but\r\nnevertheless I was on the rocks next morning at seven; and my\r\npunctuality was rewarded by the sight of Miss Lenox walking on the shore\r\nin a white dress. I clambered down and joined her before she seemed\r\naware of my presence: then she turned and laughed softly in my face.\r\n\"What an early riser you are!\" she exclaimed. \"You have brought\r\nexcellent habits home from the lazy Old World.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it would be such a pity to miss 'the prettiest hour of the day'!\" I\r\nretorted quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Were you surprised to meet me last night?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so. I had at least not expected it. I was in Belfield on\r\nWednesday, and supposed that you were there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could easily have found out my whereabouts if you had called upon\r\nmamma. I should not have expected you to be in Belfield without going\r\nnear our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lenox has too often snubbed me in my boyhood for me to count upon\r\nher grace now,\" I returned. \"But I hope your mother is very well.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was very droll to me that I had embarked upon something like an\r\nadventure for the sake of talking about old Mrs. Lenox. Still, Miss\r\nGeorgy was well worth coming out to see with the flush of healthy sleep\r\nstill upon cheek and lip and the morning light in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mamma is well,\" said she soberly. \"Poor papa too: though he is worked\r\nto death, he is still quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he do, then?\" I asked. I knew that he was one of the\r\nbook-keepers at the factories, but I wanted her to be the first to speak\r\nJack's name.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as Mr. John Holt went into the business,\" she returned, very\r\ncoolly, \"he gave my father a position. He had promised to do it years\r\nbefore, and you know how well Jack keeps all his promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack is faithful and true,\" I said, looking at her keenly. \"No one will\r\never be able to say of him, 'That man has wronged me.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say about me?\" she demanded suddenly, stopping short in\r\nher walk and facing me. \"I shall have no disguises with you, Floyd: you\r\nknow me too well. I never really loved Jack, good, kind and noble\r\nalthough I recognize him to be. When he offered me my freedom I took it.\r\nHow could I have endured to wait for him, ruined, disgraced as he was,\r\nthrough the uncertainty and pain of years? It is impossible that he\r\nshould be in a position to marry until my youth is passed.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was so tremulous and pleading, her eyes and lips so eloquent,\r\nthat she needed no vindication. I pitied Jack more than ever, but still\r\nI no longer blamed her.\r\n\r\n\"You men have a hundred chances,\" she went on. \"If the first fails you,\r\nyou have no reason for despondency, for a better one is sure to come. We\r\npoor women find our golden opportunity but once. Do not call me\r\nmercenary or false. I was neither. I had been talked into a belief that\r\nI ought to marry Jack, but when the trial came all the potential reasons\r\nfailed. Had I kept my engagement to him, I should have been a clog, an\r\nencumbrance, upon him: he is better off without me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but devoted love could have held you to him in his trouble,\"\r\nsaid I. \"If you did not feel that, your bondage through a hopeless\r\nengagement would have been a terrible burden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what he said,\" she murmured coaxingly. \"Is he angry with me?\r\ndoes he complain of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: no man could have spoken of you more kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he forgetting me?\"\r\n\r\nI met her look and smile with a curious thrill that I thought I had\r\nlived down years ago.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, Georgy,\" said I, \"that you are not one of those women whom\r\nmen forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack will forget me. He is wedded to his business: he is angry with the\r\nworld, maddened, desperate. I have walked out behind him at church in\r\nBelfield, and he has not seen me: I have met him driving in the streets,\r\nand he has not turned his head. The men who once trusted and believed\r\nin his father treated him shamefully after his misfortunes came, and\r\nJack resented it: he goes about the place seeing nobody, holding his\r\nhead high, and showing the men he meets that he asks no favor of any one\r\nof them. All the softness has gone out of him.\"\r\n\r\nI told her how wrong her idea of him was, and presently found myself\r\nrepeating many things that he had said. Before I ended I had even let\r\nher hear of our midnight stroll about the place and our look at the\r\ngabled room where we believed her to be sleeping. This pleased her.\r\n\r\n\"That is not unlike you,\" she remarked with charming complacency, \"but I\r\nnever before heard of Jack's doing anything so poetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack is not a man to write poems,\" said I, \"but he is one of the men\r\npoets write about. After you had gone up stairs last night Helen sang to\r\nher father, and the words of one of her songs were Heine's: it reminded\r\nme of Holt beneath your window.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of those German songs? I understand nothing but English.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have translated it, and it runs like this:\r\n\r\n          Silent the streets by night overtaken:\r\n            This house my darling's presence did grace;\r\n          But she the town has long forsaken,\r\n            Yet there stands the house in the selfsame place;\r\n          And there stands a man who upward is staring,\r\n            His hands hard wringing in outbursts of woe!\"\r\n\r\nI paused and looked into her face.\r\n\r\n\"That is not all of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I will tell you the rest some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Jack 'wring his hands in outbursts of woe'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens, no! I presume we both stood with our hands in our\r\npockets: I was smoking a cigar myself. It is only in poetry that one may\r\nbe picturesque in one's grief now-a-days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you think of me when you stood there, Floyd?\"\r\n\r\nHer little fingers closed on the edge of my coat and she looked up in my\r\neyes. I smiled demurely. I was determined to be quite the master of\r\nmyself with Georgina. I had suffered too much from her in the past not\r\nto be on my guard. Still, it was hard to resist the upturned face--the\r\nface with which was associated all the passionate inspiration of my\r\nearly life--the face I had carried in my mind and heart through all my\r\nwanderings, finding none to compare with it--the face which always came\r\nwith flash and quickness when I felt the warm desire and longing to love\r\nsomebody which youth must always know.\r\n\r\nI kissed her.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me startled, and ran ten paces away and sat down upon a\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" she exclaimed, bursting into light laughter, \"you have\r\nlearned pretty manners abroad!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad you like them,\" said I, going up to her.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't like them at all,\" she retorted, shaking her head. \"You\r\nremind me of a toy I used to play with years ago--a very pretty,\r\nharmless, inoffensive-looking toy, but which when touched unguardedly\r\nchanged all of a sudden into a dreadful little fiend that flew right up\r\ninto your face. Such a surprise is enough to make one's hair turn gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I have vindicated myself from the charge of being,\r\n'pretty, harmless and inoffensive,' have I not? As for the gray hairs, I\r\ndon't see one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite admired you last night,\" sighed Georgy, \"you looked so\r\ninteresting and innocent. Now--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I then suffered in your estimation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall remember hereafter,\" she said with a delightful little laugh,\r\n\"to whom I am talking. Now let us forget all about it. There are other\r\nthings I want to talk about. I want to ask you how you like Helen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I like Helen?\" I did not fancy her question: I had never approved\r\nher tone regarding her cousin. \"I think Miss Floyd very beautiful, and a\r\nvery elegant girl besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like her proud cold manner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she proud and cold? Perhaps so to Thorpe: certainly, she is the most\r\nunaffected child where the rest of us are concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"She never forgets her wealth and position. I do not blame her: in her\r\nplace I should be quite spoiled. Think of it!\" she went on, with such\r\neagerness that tears stood in her eyes: \"Mr. Raymond left her\r\neverything--everything except a hundred thousand dollars which he gave\r\nto a college. She is so rich that she can lose a hundred thousand\r\ndollars and never feel it. It did not belong to the property, but came\r\nfrom a deposit which had accumulated ever since she was a baby. She\r\nbegged her grandfather to do some good with it: she did not want to have\r\neverything herself. Might he not have given it to me?--Helen would have\r\nliked that--but no: he hated me too well for that. It has all gone for a\r\ndreary old professorship in the college where he graduated sixty years\r\nago. And I am as poor as ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"But Helen is generous with her wealth, I am sure: she will do a great\r\ndeal for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She gave me the money to buy the dress I am wearing, the very shoes on\r\nmy feet;\" and she granted me a delicious glimpse of French slippers.\r\n\"But do you suppose I like alms? If I am a beggar, Floyd, it is from\r\nnecessity, not because I have not plenty of pride. The child means to be\r\ngood to me, I suppose, but it makes me bitterly angry with her at times\r\nthat she has the right to be gracious and condescending. I am such an\r\nunlucky girl!\"\r\n\r\nBut she laughed while she complained, and I echoed her laugh when she\r\nsaid she was unlucky.\r\n\r\n\"You unlucky!\" I exclaimed. \"You are one of those women who have it in\r\ntheir power to have every wish in life granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that. Besides, it is hard for me to know what I\r\nwant now-a-days. I used to think if a fairy came offering me the\r\nfulfilment of my dearest longing, it would be easy enough to secure\r\nlifelong happiness at once: I should have asked for wealth. But now they\r\nare comfortable at home: they would not know how to spend more money\r\nthan papa earns at the factory. And I am comparatively rich: I have\r\nalmost five hundred dollars in my purse, part of the thousand which\r\nHelen gave me a month ago. I cried myself to sleep last night, I was so\r\nunhappy; yet, all the same, I am not quite sure what I want. Life is so\r\ndull! That is what ails me, I think.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her in uncertainty as to her mood, but she left me in doubt,\r\nand began telling me about society at the Point, her friend Mrs.\r\nWoodruff, and the houseful of guests. She told me stories with some\r\nscandalous flavor about them, enough to give them a zest; she mimicked\r\nall the earnest people and spoke with contempt of all the shallow ones;\r\nshe appeared to have fathomed all the petty under-currents which\r\ninfluenced people's actions, detected every shade of pretension and\r\nstudied all the affectations and habits of the men and women she saw\r\nintimately. All this, too, without betraying any personal liking for one\r\nof them, and seeming to regard them all as mere puppets, to some of whom\r\nshe attached herself when there was anything to gain, and from whom she\r\nwithdrew herself when there was anything to lose. But she was too clever\r\nto allow me time to think what qualities of mind and heart lay behind\r\nthis philosophy, and I was very much diverted.\r\n\r\n\"I must take you to see Mrs. Woodruff,\" she remarked. \"You will be\r\nwelcome in the set as flowers in May. You are spending the summer here,\r\nI suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no plans. Where my mother is I shall be for the present, I have\r\nbeen separated from her so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful! But about your future, Floyd? Have you a career decided\r\nupon, or are you to be a gentleman of leisure?\"\r\n\r\nI flushed: \"My resolution is not taken as to what I shall be--certainly\r\nnot an idle man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell your fortune,\" she said in a low voice. \"You need not cross\r\nmy palm with silver for it, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"With gold, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell it for love, but it is a golden fortune. You will marry\r\nHelen Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I with decision and some anger, \"I shall never marry Helen.\r\nYou do me too much honor. She would never look at me; and if she would\r\nthere is something within me which forbids my marrying a rich woman. But\r\nit is nonsense. For Heaven's sake don't allude to it again! The man who\r\nmarries her will be, to my thinking, the most fortunate of men, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't talk about it,\" said she good-naturedly. \"There comes Mr.\r\nThorpe to bid us good-morning. Astonishing how well he likes the walk to\r\nThe Headlands!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Thorpe indeed, carelessly but irreproachably dressed as usual,\r\nand looking at us with a smile of internal amusement, which he was\r\nprobably too well-bred to express in words, for he merely drawled a\r\ngood-morning and remarked on the beauty of the day.\r\n\r\n\"You're a famous pedestrian in these days, Thorpe,\" I said, rising with\r\na trifle of embarrassment from my seat as close to Miss Lenox's as the\r\nrocks permitted, \"and an early riser too. When I got up this morning at\r\nhalf-past six I told myself that I should see nobody for three hours at\r\nleast, yet both Miss Lenox and you equal me in my love for the early\r\nmorning hours.\"\r\n\r\nBut Thorpe was indifferent, and I saw at once that his mind was too\r\npreoccupied to allow of his wasting a thought upon the reason of my\r\nrising earlier than usual. \"If you got up at half-past six,\" said he\r\ncoolly, looking at his watch, \"you must be ready for your breakfast, for\r\nit is a quarter to nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go in,\" remarked Georgy, rising and shaking out her white\r\nskirts and putting herself to rights generally after the manner in which\r\nbirds and women plume themselves. \"Did you come to breakfast, Mr.\r\nThorpe?\" she inquired with bare civility.\r\n\r\n\"I thought of dropping in,\" he returned; and as I assisted Miss Lenox up\r\nthe ledge I turned to see if he were following us. He seemed to be\r\nwaiting, however, for us to get away, and when I gained another distant\r\nglimpse of him he was apparently searching for something in a crevice of\r\nthe rocks. Yet we were scarcely on the back piazza, before he had\r\nrejoined us in high spirits, and I was conscious of a gleam in his eyes\r\nwhich I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nI could not resist speculations upon the reasons of his intimacy at the\r\nhouse, but dismissed them all as idle, for I knew very well that the\r\nhabits of a young man at a watering-place are made by the necessity of\r\nfilling up the hours of the day with occupation. The cottagers have\r\nperfect leisure as a rule, and with amiable, courteous ways press upon\r\nall acquaintances an incessant hospitality; and Thorpe, always\r\nfrivolous, had at once fallen into the general way. Here at The\r\nHeadlands the house was still under the shadow of deep mourning, but his\r\nold acquaintance with Mr. Floyd and my mother made his frequent visits\r\nadmissible. At any rate, beyond Mr. Floyd's unobtrusive sarcasm at his\r\nexpense, I heard no objections to Thorpe's dropping in to breakfast.\r\nMills brought him a plate, and he himself chose a seat at Helen's left\r\nhand, and devoted himself to her service in a way that I knew bored her\r\nimmeasurably. He sugared her strawberries and creamed them generously,\r\nand she sent them to her parrot. \"I will take some more strawberries,\r\nMills,\" she said then, and treated Thorpe's further attempts to serve\r\nher with chilly disdain.\r\n\r\n\"Now that Floyd is here,\" said Mr. Floyd when we were through breakfast,\r\n\"I shall indulge in laziness no longer, but shall sit by and see him\r\nwork.\" And the result was that for the next two weeks he and my mother,\r\nHelen and I, all sat in Mr. Raymond's study for an hour or two every\r\nmorning and looked over his papers. Two or three times Mr. Wickham the\r\nlawyer came from New York, and it was easy enough to see that Helen's\r\nproperty was so large, its investments so various, that its proper care\r\nwas work enough for one man.\r\n\r\n\"I shall look about for a husband for her at once,\" Mr. Floyd said half\r\na dozen times to the lawyer when we three men were alone: \"nobody can\r\nexpect me to waste my few energies in looking after all these\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Depend upon it, sir,\" Mr. Wickham would return with an easy chuckle,\r\n\"you will find the world full of young men who will be happy to relieve\r\nyou of every responsibility regarding Miss Floyd's fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"They shall none of them have her,\" her father exclaimed once,\r\nfiercely--\"not one! No man but one who loves her for her sweet self\r\nalone shall ever have my little girl.\" At such times Mr. Wickham always\r\nlooked at me with a critical curiosity which I could forgive in so old a\r\nfriend of Helen's, but which at the same time robbed me of a certain\r\ncomposure I should have liked to carry through the difficulties of my\r\npresent position. For I was, in truth, performing all the duties of an\r\nexecutor and mastering the details of the schedule of property, while\r\nMr. Floyd sat by and made jokes upon the way Helen would spend her\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\"Hair-pins cost a great deal,\" he would affirm solemnly, \"and pins. How\r\nmuch pin-money had the princess royal? Put down fifteen thousand dollars\r\nfor hair-pins, black pins, white pins: what other pins do women use?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I would expostulate, \"you must attend to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" he would ask, turning his fine melancholy eyes upon me.\r\n\"Don't tire me out, Floyd.\"\r\n\r\nWe were alone, although my mother and Helen were almost within hearing\r\non the balcony.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to do everything for you, sir,\" I said, \"but nevertheless\r\nit seems to me that it is scarcely prudent for you to entrust me with\r\nyour duties. I am totally inexperienced; my knowledge of finance is the\r\nmere mastery of figures; I am--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, dear boy,\" said Mr. Floyd in a kind but weary voice: \"I am\r\nonly trying to save you trouble. When I die you will take my place as\r\nHelen's executor and trustee. It would be harder then for you to learn\r\nthe mystery of all these details by yourself. Now I am here to teach\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n  ELLEN W. OLNEY.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE RAINBOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n          O Iris! bringing balm for Summer's tears,\r\n            So lightly gliding down thy bridge of rose,\r\n            I know not why my spirit drinks repose\r\n          Soon as thy footfall the horizon nears.\r\n          Spellbound I watch the crimson-shaded piers\r\n            As arch by arch the blooming pathway grows,\r\n            And where the richest flush of color glows\r\n          I trace thy trailing garments. Sighs and fears\r\n            Have vanished: in one long and ardent gaze\r\n          Thy steps I follow down the heavenly slope.\r\n            Iris, be mine thy message! Let thy rays\r\n          Write out how I with destiny may cope.\r\n            Ah! spanned with light would be all coming days,\r\n          Could I but read thy oracle of hope.\r\n\r\n                                    FRANCES L. MACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1878.\r\n\r\nIII.--FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the \"Memorial Hall\" of the Champ de Mars--the Gallery of Fine Arts\r\nwhich there takes the place of the familiar building in Fairmount\r\nPark--that has decided the really great success of the Exposition of\r\n1878. The unanimous verdict of popular admiration was given at\r\nPhiladelphia to the machinery: in Paris it is as strongly pronounced in\r\nfavor of the fine arts. Paris is, indisputably, the capital of modern\r\nart, and her title to this proud distinction is to-day confirmed by the\r\nassembled peoples with all the solemnity and authority of a universal\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\nI have, like all visitors no doubt, yielded to the seductive spell of\r\nthis magnificent collection of objects of art, to which two worlds have\r\ncontributed, and under the influence of the keen and exalted enjoyment\r\nof the first few days I should have found it impossible to qualify by a\r\nsingle censure the expression of my admiration. But after a short\r\nretirement in the country, where I allowed my mind to lie fallow, I\r\nfound that I could revisit the galleries of the Champ de Mars with more\r\njudgment and method, and that the beauties of the first order, which I\r\nadmired as much as ever, no longer made me blind to the defects and the\r\nweak points of certain parts.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it must be admitted that the Exhibition of this year is\r\nnot equal to that of 1855; and this is no more than was to be expected,\r\nwhen one remembers that the latter had brought together the scattered\r\nmasterpieces of the long period of half a century--a period illustrated\r\nby such names as Ingres, Delacroix, Decamps and others. This splendid\r\nassemblage of so many important works could not be repeated in 1867; and\r\nat that time there were unmistakable indications that a new artistic\r\ncurrent had set in, and we saw the first rays of the coming glory of the\r\npainter of genre and of landscape--the triumph of Meissonier, of Gerome,\r\nof Theodore Rousseau, of Corot.\r\n\r\nThis year, the tiny, pleasing genre pictures are still very numerous,\r\nand in this respect the Exposition of 1878 is not unlike that of 1867,\r\nwhile in another aspect it is superior to it. If, on the one hand, we\r\nmiss the names of the great masters of landscape, who, dying, have left\r\nno successors, we have, on the other hand, to hail the advent of some\r\nothers who have risen above the level of genre and have returned to the\r\ntraditions of high art: I refer to MM. Bonnat, J.P. Laurens and Baudry.\r\nThanks to these great artists, one can assert with confidence that there\r\nhas been an advance within the last ten years. And how art widens its\r\nborders and augments the number of its adepts! How many painters there\r\nare to-day!--of the second or of the third rank, to be sure, but masters\r\nof their business, skilful and conscientious. In 1867 the jury admitted\r\nbut four hundred pictures. In 1878 it has had to receive eleven hundred!\r\nEvidently, French art is in the fulness of its summer bloom. Its decline\r\nwill come, for Art, which knows no country, and has wandered from the\r\nEast to the South, and from the South to the West, will doubtless travel\r\nstill, and will some day leave Paris to dwell with other races and under\r\nother skies. But to-day her home is Paris--Paris, her well-beloved city.\r\n\r\nSince 1871 especially, we have witnessed a fresh starting into life, an\r\nactivity, indeed, almost feverish. In 1871 and in 1874 the Minister of\r\nFine Arts officially recognized a general return toward serious and\r\nvigorous work, and in 1876 he bore testimony to the exceptional\r\nbrilliancy of the Salon, which showed the \"influence and impulse of a\r\ngenuine revival.\"\r\n\r\nHistorical painting, unfortunately, can never be adequately represented\r\nat exhibitions. Designed for the civil and religious monuments of\r\nFrance, whence, from the nature of the case, they cannot be removed, its\r\nmost important illustrations are to be found at the Opera, at the Palace\r\nof Justice and of the Legion of Honor, at the museums of Marseilles and\r\nof Amiens, the Hotel de Ville of Poitiers, and in the numerous churches\r\nof Paris and throughout the country. The immense work which Baudry has\r\nexecuted for the foyer of the Opera is absent from the Exhibition, and\r\nthis great painter, whom some consider the first of his time, is not\r\nrepresented at the Champ de Mars by even a sketch. Fortunately, the\r\nPalace of Justice has parted with two principal works of Leon Bonnat,\r\nhis _Christ_ and _Justice between Guilt and Innocence_. The Pantheon has\r\npermitted the exhibition of the large decorative paintings in which\r\nCabanel has represented the principal episodes of the history of St.\r\nLouis. But the largest historical canvases on the walls of the gallery\r\nare those by J.P. Laurens, belonging to the museums of Florence, of\r\nHavre, of Nantes and of Toulouse. Laurens delights in the Middle Ages,\r\ngloomy and stately periods of ecclesiastical domination and feudal\r\nviolence. He is the painter of tortures and of tombs (the _Exhumation of\r\nPope Formosus_, _The Interdict_, _Francis Borgia before the Coffin of\r\nIsabella of Portugal_), but his vigorous and severe genius never suffers\r\nhim to fall into overstrained action and theatrical artifice. He does\r\nnot move us by declamatory gestures and forced attitudes. Nothing can be\r\nmore simple, yet nothing more affecting, than the _Execution of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien_ and the _Death of Marceau_. Many young artists are following\r\nthis new path, which has opened such success to M. Laurens. MM. Cormon,\r\nDupain (in his _Good Samaritan_), Benjamin Constant (_Entry of Mohammed\r\nII. into Constantinople_), and Sylvestre (_Locusta and Nero trying a\r\nPoison_) have sent to the Champ de Mars the fine historical compositions\r\nthat gained for them the first medals and the prize of honor at the last\r\nSalons. M. Tony Robert-Fleury has two vast canvases, the _Sack of\r\nCorinth_ and the _Reform of the Mad-house in 1795_--large and admirable\r\ncompositions, which engraving has already made popular. Of course we\r\nfind M. Landelle's inevitable _Eastern Dancing-Girl_, and an _Italian\r\nWoman_ by M. Hebert. There could be no exhibition without these. These\r\ntwo painters have talent, individuality, delicacy of feeling, but they\r\nare absolutely without imagination. M. Hebert, in particular, has\r\nlearned nothing since his _Malaria_, which has been for a long time at\r\nthe Museum of the Luxembourg. He has not discovered, nor even sought\r\nfor, anything beyond this; and this eternal repetition of the same\r\nsubject is a malady which afflicts too many of the artists of our day.\r\nOne no longer distinguishes between the pictures of certain of our\r\npopular painters. Even M. Luminais never travels beyond his specialty,\r\nwhich is the barbarian Gaul, though he does vary somewhat the attitudes\r\nand physiognomy of his characters. Henner and Ribot, two great artists,\r\nwho are better appreciated by their professional brethren than by the\r\npublic, will undoubtedly gain much by this year's exhibition. The eulogy\r\nof competent criticism will be accepted as authoritative, and will\r\ncompel the admiration of the crowd, which is not very apt to comprehend\r\nnew and original forms in painting. Schopenhauer has classified the\r\nprofessions according to the degree of difficulty which they find in\r\nmaking their merits understood by the world at large; and he puts in the\r\nfront rank, as the most quickly and easily comprehended and applauded,\r\nacrobats, dancers and players; philosophers come last of all; and\r\nimmediately before them the painters.\r\n\r\nPortraiture would seem to be more in esteem than ever. Everywhere along\r\nthe walls are to be seen nothing but statesmen, poets and women of the\r\nworld, whose identity is indicated in the official catalogue by initials\r\nonly, but whom everybody recognizes at a glance. Many of these portraits\r\nare life-like and admirable in expression, and one can say of them what\r\nVictor Cherbuliez said of Mademoiselle Nelly Jacquemart's picture of\r\nThiers: \"The house is inhabited: some one is looking out of the\r\nwindow.\" This time Mademoiselle Jacquemart exhibits portraits of M.\r\nDuruy, M. Dufaure and a young lady. Singularly enough, she paints men\r\nbetter than she does women. Her portrait of Mademoiselle G---- B---- is\r\nvery inferior to the others. Virility, in short, is the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of the talent of this woman.\r\n\r\nM. Cabanel's portraits of women of the great world are conventionally\r\npainted, and with the coldness of manner which distinguishes him. One\r\nfeels that if these fine creatures should speak they would utter nothing\r\nbut the commonplaces which pass for conversation in the salons. The\r\nduchess of Vallambrosa--\"the queen of the strand,\" as they call her at\r\nCannes--Madame de Lavalette, the countess of Mercy-Argenteau, are all\r\nthere, as if against their will and disdainful of the vulgar herd which\r\nis staring at them. To make amends, however, the duchess of Luynes is\r\ncharming, surrounded and, as it were, adorned by her beautiful children.\r\nM. Cabanel is the recognized head of what may be called the official\r\nschool. To get medals and crosses or the prize of Rome, to obtain\r\ncommissions from government, it is now-a-days almost necessary to have\r\nbeen his pupil. Never had painter a more lofty position. Perhaps it is\r\nthe opinion at the ministry of Fine Arts that Bonnat and Laurens will be\r\nso well paid by posthumous fame and the admiration of future generations\r\nthat it is but fair to keep the balance between the masters even by\r\nrewarding M. Cabanel in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nI have said that there are many portraits at the Exhibition, but I do\r\nnot mean to complain of this. Indeed, we cannot too highly applaud the\r\nrevival of this noble branch of art, to which we owe the _Joconde_ of\r\nthe Louvre and the _Violin-player_ of the Sciarra Palace. Many a fair\r\nyoung girl unknown to fame, many a matron whose quiet life will pass\r\nunheeded by the world, will by her portrait enter into immortality.\r\nTorn, sooner or later, from the family roof and carried to a museum,\r\nthere to be gazed upon by thousands of eyes, her smile or her reverie\r\nwill recall for generations to come that sigh of Senancour's: \"O woman\r\nthat I might have loved!\"\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if this regretful tribute to genius--which may perhaps\r\nsome day be heard before the portraits of Henner, of Bonnat or of\r\nMadrazzo--will ever be inspired by those of M. Carolus Duran. This\r\nartist is the painter of elegant trifles and worldly vanities, of grand\r\nand striking toilettes, of blondes in violet and yellow and brunettes in\r\ngray and rose, for, like M. Worth the man-milliner, it pleases his fancy\r\nto attempt the reconciliation of the most inimical colors. For the rest,\r\nthe future will no doubt owe him a debt of gratitude for the precious\r\nevidence which his pictures will furnish of the dress of the period.\r\nIndeed, without the help of certain of our portrait-painters future\r\ninvestigators would find themselves sadly at a loss in reconstructing\r\nthe Paris of Napoleon III. and of the Third Republic. We are so much\r\nunder the influence of the past that our artists scarcely have the\r\nsentiment of the civilization which surrounds them. Our colleges send us\r\ninto the world, not Frenchmen, but Greeks and Romans, knowing nothing of\r\nmodern life, and inspired by our classical studies with a profound\r\ncontempt for the manners and usages of the present day. Our statues,\r\nbas-reliefs, medals and pictures represent the events of all ages except\r\nour own. The attempts in the direction of realism of these latest days,\r\nthe paintings of Courbet and Manet, seem, by a sort of instinctive\r\npreference, to seek out the _ugly_, rather than to give us an exact\r\nreproduction of contemporaneous Nature. Some of our genre\r\npainters--Millet, for example, and Jules Breton--have, it is true,\r\nstudied the actual and the modern, but their types are all taken from\r\nthe rustic class, and it is safe to say that outside of portraiture\r\nneither the men nor the women of the world will leave a trace upon the\r\nart of the period.\r\n\r\nLet us note, however, one exception to this statement. I refer to\r\ncertain painters of military scenes who have chosen to call up the\r\nspectre of the Franco-German war--Edouard Detaille, Neuville, Boulanger.\r\nThese have ventured to depict one side of modern life--and an important\r\none, alas!--modern warfare, not by showing us those episodes of\r\nclassical combat where half a dozen cavaliers, mounted upon their heavy\r\nhistorical horses, fight hand to hand for the possession of a flag, and\r\ntrample under foot a wounded wretch whose very _pose_ is traditional,\r\nbut by giving us actual scenes witnessed during the autumn of 1870 and\r\nthe winter of 1871--scenes often frightful, but always grandly effective\r\nand worthy of art. A sentiment of diplomatic propriety, with which the\r\nGermans were but little troubled at Philadelphia, has naturally kept\r\nthese paintings out of the Champ de Mars, and banished them to Goupil's\r\nin the Rue Chaptal. We certainly do not complain of this, but we cannot\r\nhelp regretting that modern life should be so slightly represented in\r\nthe art of an epoch indued with a life so intense. There are laurels yet\r\nto be won in the field of serious painting--triumphs such as Balzac,\r\nThackeray and Tourgueneff have achieved in literature, and Gavarni in\r\ncaricature, by the faithful representation of phases of modern life.\r\n\r\nSince so many Frenchmen are converted by their early classical training\r\nnot only into citizens of Rome or of Athens, but into veritable pagans,\r\nwe naturally find the Exhibition full of gods and goddesses, of demigods\r\nand nymphs--the _Truth_ of M. Jules Lefebvre, for instance, and his\r\n_Vision_, losing itself in the mists of morning; the _Sarpedon_ of M.\r\nLevy; M. Bouguereau's _Flora and Zephyr_ and _Meeting of Nymphs_; the\r\n_Naiads_ of Henner, etc. Amongst all these mythological tableaux one's\r\nattention is arrested by the striking productions of M. Gustave Moreau,\r\na remarkable union of technical ability and poetical\r\nfancy--hallucinations of an opium-smoker who should be able to paint his\r\nvisions with all the confidence and knowledge of a master. Paul de\r\nSaint-Victor, the eminent critic, has called these canvases \"painted\r\ndreams;\" and they cannot be better described. _Hercules fighting the\r\nHydra of Lerna_, _Salome_, _Jacob and the Angel_, _Moses exposed upon\r\nthe Nile_, are dazzling phantoms, which, eluding the literal text of\r\nhistory, recede to the depths of an unknown past. We do not think of\r\ndiscussing their accuracy: we are absorbed in admiration of this\r\nwondrous art, at once subtle and splendid, which makes us dream of lost\r\ncivilizations and buried empires. Gustave Moreau is more than a painter:\r\nhe is a magician and his pencil is an enchanter's wand.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we have plenty of archaeological painters, who painfully\r\nrestore antiquity for us, following accurate authorities and examples.\r\nThe curiosity to know the past, which has created a literature of its\r\nown, the researches of travellers and of learned men, the excavations\r\nmade in Greece, in Asia Minor, in Africa, at Pompeii, have led many\r\nartists to search for new effects in this direction. Every one will\r\nrecall the circuses and the Roman scenes of Gerome. This year he\r\nexhibits hardly anything but modern Oriental subjects--Turkish baths,\r\nBashi-Bazouks and lions--but his pupils have now taken the place which\r\ntheir master held in 1867. Hector Leroux, one of the thousand and one\r\npainters of this Neo-Grecian school, shows us a _Toilette of Minerva\r\nPolias_ and _A Miracle in the Temple of Vesta_, his most celebrated\r\nwork. Gustave Boulanger exhibits his _Roman Baths_, his _Roman Comedians\r\nrehearsing their Roles_, and his _Roman Promenades_, which the\r\nwealthiest amateurs, MM. Aguado, Andre, Stebbins, contended for at the\r\nlate Salons; M. Lecomte du Nouy his _Pharoah slaying the Bearers of Evil\r\nTidings_ and his _Homer Begging_; while M. Alma-Tadema completes the\r\ngroup with his best-known pictures, including _The Studio of an Antique\r\nPainter_, _An Audience at the House of Agrippa_, and _The Vintage at\r\nRome_, which was also at Philadelphia. Americans will remember the young\r\nreddish-haired priestess of Ceres, so elegantly attired and _coiffee_,\r\nadvancing with torch in hand and followed by flute-players. The details,\r\nwhich are multiplied almost to profusion, are all calculated to enhance\r\nthe effect, and are distributed with exquisite art. The amount of\r\nresearch which this work suggests is almost incredible, and it was\r\nperhaps a more laborious undertaking to paint the _Vintage at Rome_ than\r\nto write the Carthaginian romance of Gustave Flaubert. Alma-Tadema\r\nexhibits in the English gallery, and his contribution has raised the\r\naverage of that section by a good third. If I have spoken of this\r\npainter in connection with the pupils of Gerome, it is that, considering\r\nhis place of birth (Dromvyp, Netherlands), I think that I have an equal\r\nright with the English to classify him according to my fancy.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the remote antiquity in which the poet-painters of the\r\nNeo-Greek school delight to dwell, and come back to modern times.\r\nPassing through one of the central rooms, one is struck by the\r\nappearance of a great space of gilded wall hung with pictures\r\nconsiderable in number, but mostly quite diminutive in size. It needs no\r\nreference to the catalogue nor to the signature of these works to tell\r\nus the name of their author. If the singular talent which they display\r\nwere not enough, the _mise en scene_ would leave no doubt that this\r\nextraordinary piece of wall has the honor of supporting the exhibit of\r\nM. Meissonier. M. Meissonier holds a great position in contemporary\r\nart--a fact which is known to everybody, and to no one better than to M.\r\nMeissonier. But it was in 1867 rather than in 1878 that he ought to have\r\ngilded his wall. It was in the former year that he exhibited his _1814_,\r\nhis _Reading at Diderot's_ and other incomparable works, which placed\r\nhim beyond all dispute at the head of the French school. To-day he shows\r\nus but one considerable work, the _Cuirassiers of 1805_, and fifteen\r\nsmall pieces--very pretty things, but then he has taught his pupils to\r\nimitate him too well! They have so often and so skilfully counterfeited\r\nthe art of their master that the dignity of his work seems lessened and\r\nits value diluted, as it were, until for the substance we are given the\r\nshadow, and the _tableau_ is replaced by the _tableautin_. The same\r\ntendency to contraction is apparent in every country. Paintings are\r\ngrowing smaller, as if to keep in proportion with the small modern\r\nsalons. That this is due to the great influence of M. Meissonier there\r\nis no doubt, but no diminution of his own fame accompanies the dwindling\r\nof his pictures.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there are half a dozen painters at the Champ de Mars who lack\r\nnothing but the golden wall to make them the equals of the master. M.\r\nDetaille is absent, but we have M. Worms, with seven little chefs\r\nd'oeuvre; M. Vibert, with his _Departure of the Spanish Bride and\r\nBridegroom_, the _Serenade_, and the _Toilette of the Madonna_; M.\r\nFirmin Girard, with his _Flower-Girl_; M. Berne-Bellecour, in his famous\r\n_Coup de Canon_; MM. Fichel, Lesrel, Louis Leloir and others whom I have\r\nnot space to mention, as exact and as minute in detail as their _chef_,\r\nand, moreover, almost as well paid by amateurs, especially Americans.\r\n\r\nLandscape-painting mourns the loss of its greatest masters. Amongst all\r\nthe painters, Death seems to have singled out the _paysagistes_ by\r\npreference. Since the last Exhibition how many have gone! Chintreuil,\r\nBelly, Corot, Courbet, Daubigny, Millet, Diaz, are no more. A few\r\ncanvases recall them--the _Wave_ of Courbet, an admirable effect of snow\r\nby Daubigny, and four or five pictures by Corot--but one regrets that\r\nthe illustrious dead have not had the honor of a room apart. The members\r\nof the jury have been careful to keep the best places for their own\r\nworks, while the masterpieces of departed genius have been banished to\r\nthe top of the walls or half hidden in corners. M. Cabanel and M.\r\nBouguereau fill whole rooms with their pale compositions, and--Millet is\r\nabsent!\r\n\r\nHas the school of French landscape-painting survived these serious\r\nlosses? We may reply with confidence that it has. This very year, in the\r\nExposition of the Champs Elysees, the _Haymaking_ of M. Bastien Lepage\r\nreveals a great painter. At the Champ de Mars there are admirable\r\nlandscapes by living artists--Hanoteau, who with such masterly power of\r\nexecution bends and crooks in every direction the knotted branches of\r\nhis giant oaks; Emile Breton, painter of the melancholy scenes of\r\nwinter; Harpignies, faithful interpreter of the varying aspects of the\r\nvalley of the Allier under all the changes of day and season; Eugene\r\nFeyen and Feyen-Perrin, who delight us with the sea-coast of Brittany\r\nand its fisher-women and bathing-women; Van-Marcke, who is less than the\r\nsuccessor, but more than the imitator, of Troyon; and finally, MM.\r\nPelouse and Sege, representatives of new forces and processes.\r\n\r\nAmericans are supposed in Paris to prefer highly-finished and elaborate\r\nwork, like that of Gerome, but I have seen in America examples of the\r\npainter who elaborates least of all, who lays on his colors in the\r\nboldest manner--in a word, the painter of general effect, Isabey. It is\r\nrefreshing to meet again, here, his _Wedding-Feast_, a delightful repose\r\nto the eye, almost wearied with minute perfection of detail.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the labyrinth of French art we must not forget a class\r\nof painters who have received a great deal of admiration, and who\r\ndeserve it, whatever rank one may be disposed to assign to their special\r\nbranch of art. I refer to the painters of still-life. There is Vollon,\r\nfor instance, whose name suggests those wonderful representations of\r\narmor, of rich goldsmith's work, superb tapestries and damascened metal,\r\nto say nothing of the equally admirable counterfeits of warming-pans and\r\nsaucepans, which delight the lover of _nature-morte_. We find here his\r\nfamous kettle of red copper, sold at a price which might suggest that it\r\nwas of solid gold. Amateurs and dealers pronounce Vollon the first of\r\npainters in his specialty, though there are some who profess a\r\npreference for his rival, Blaise-Desgoffes, of whom there are three\r\nexamples in the Exposition; and though these are only Venetian glass,\r\nGothic missals, jewel-boxes and the like, there are some of them worth\r\nthirty thousand francs at the very least: it will be understood that I\r\nspeak of the paintings, and not of what they represent. Philippe\r\nRousseau displays not less than a dozen pictures, and the names of\r\ntheir owners, Alexandre Dumas, the baroness de Rothschild, Barbedienne,\r\nEdouard Dubufe, etc., show how much he is the _mode_. Indeed, it is\r\nimpossible to imagine cheeses more savory, fresher oysters, peaches and\r\nvegetables more inviting, and flowers--I had almost said more fragrant,\r\nso perfect is the illusion of reality.\r\n\r\nBut we must tear ourselves from these fascinating galleries, for should\r\nwe write for ever we shall always be sure to forget some celebrity who\r\ndeserves to be mentioned. We have said nothing of the scenes from\r\nfashionable life; nor of the dogs and horses which MM. Claude and J.\r\nLewis Brown render so capitally; nor of the portraits of Perignon,\r\nEdouard Dubufe and Cot; nor of the flowers of Mademoiselle Escallier.\r\nThree great names, Jules Dupre, Rosa Bonheur and Puvis de Chavannes, are\r\nabsent--one knows not why.\r\n\r\nBelgium is next in order--thrifty Belgium, where painting is a\r\ncommercial industry and its products an important article of\r\nexportation. The Belgian display in the Champ de Mars is certainly a\r\nconsiderable one in point of numbers, which will not surprise us when we\r\nremember that there are at least twelve art-schools in the country--to\r\nsay nothing of the great academies of Brussels and Antwerp--where\r\nhundreds of young men are daily drilled in the grammar and technique of\r\nart. But genius is the gift of Nature, not of schools. All that the\r\nlatter can bestow is probably here, but we miss the imagination, the\r\nvariety, the sentiment of the born artist, and it needs no very critical\r\nexamination of these paintings to show us that the acquired dexterity of\r\nthe academy, the mere _business_ of the painter, is almost the only\r\ncharacteristic of the Belgian school.\r\n\r\nThere are some examples of \"high art,\" such as _The Pope and the Emperor\r\nof Germany at Canossa in 1077_, by M. Cluysenaar, a composition as cold\r\nas it is vast; some illustrations of the national history by M. Wauters,\r\nwho reminds us, in some respects, of the great French painter Laurens,\r\nthough lacking his power; and there are the historico-religious\r\npictures of M. Verlat. But much the best things in the Belgian\r\ncollection are the numerous works of a painter whose aims are not so\r\nhigh, and who in Brussels seems like an exile from Paris. M. Alfred\r\nStevens draws his inspiration from fashionable life; and no Parisian\r\ncould surpass the execution of his velvets and laces and the thousand\r\nnew stuffs which Fashion invents every year--_gants de Suede_, and faces\r\ntoo of a certain type, the pretty _chiffonnees_ faces of girls of every\r\nrank in life. But the pretty faces are, after all, mere accessories in a\r\npicture where the principals are the hat and the dress and the parasol,\r\nupon which, as any one can see, the artist has bestowed all his loving\r\ncare. Nothing of his, however, in the Exposition can compare with his\r\n_Young Mother_, which I saw last year in the Academy at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nNext after Stevens, in point of reputation, comes M. Willems, who really\r\nbelongs to the French school of Gerome, but who feels himself under\r\nobligation, in his character of Fleming, to paint nothing but what\r\nTerburg and Metzu painted two centuries before him. The man without a\r\nplumed hat and big boots and a great sword at his side has, for M.\r\nWillems, no existence. I would not say that he does not paint hat, boots\r\nand sword as well as the old Flemish masters themselves did, but while\r\nthey drew from the life he paints at second hand, and the modern artist\r\nwho passes his days in the vain effort to revivify the models of his\r\npredecessors will always rank below the masters whom he imitates, as M.\r\nWillems does, with so many others whom a false public taste encourages\r\nin a hopeless pursuit.\r\n\r\nThere are no landscapes in the Belgian section, if one may be allowed to\r\nexcept the _marines_ of M. Clays, and yet Belgium can boast of at least\r\none excellent _paysagiste_, M. Cesar de Cock, who, unfortunately, is not\r\nrepresented in the Exposition.\r\n\r\nFrench painters have often been blamed for neglecting the material\r\naround them, and for trespassing upon the domain of foreign artists by\r\nrepresenting Russian peasants and Italian beggars or selecting subjects\r\nfrom Spain or Japan; but I have looked in vain through the various\r\ngalleries for any evidence that other countries are a whit less\r\nobnoxious to this reproach than our own. Each nation forages in its\r\nneighbor's field. Is it too much to hope that modern art may free itself\r\nfrom the bondage of a senseless fashion, and may take to the study of\r\nthe living types close at hand? Russia and America, for instance, have\r\nshown themselves capable of producing a literature distinctively\r\nnational and characteristic: must they ever remain without a school of\r\nart as indigenous to the soil, and shall their painting never have its\r\nTourgueneff and its Bret Harte? The law of development may require that\r\nthe birth of a nation's art shall succeed that of its letters--though\r\nthe history of the Renaissance would seem to contradict this theory--but\r\nwhether this be so or not, it is certain that one does not imagine one's\r\nself in Moscow while perambulating the Russian _salon_ in the Champ de\r\nMars, where the best representative of the national art, M. Siemiradski,\r\nhas chosen for the two paintings which have deservedly won a medal of\r\nhonor subjects from ancient Rome--the one an amateur hesitating in his\r\nchoice between two articles of equal value--namely, a chased cup and a\r\nfemale slave--and the other representing a soiree of Nero. The subject\r\nof this last is horrible. The tyrant, crowned with flowers and\r\nsurrounded by women and freedmen, descends from his palace. Attached to\r\nlong poles and besmeared with pitch, ready for the fatal flame, are the\r\nliving bodies of wretched Christians which will illumine to-night the\r\ngardens of Caesar. _Living Torches_ is the title of the picture, which is\r\none of the most successful paintings of the Exposition, and has given\r\nits author a high rank among contemporary artists.\r\n\r\nThe painters of the United States naturally feel the inspiration of the\r\ncountry of their sojourn, be it France or Italy or Germany, for most of\r\nthem study abroad; but it is to be hoped that they will, after their\r\nreturn to their own beautiful land, find motives for grander and more\r\npicturesque studies than these hackneyed Old-World scenes of ours can\r\nafford. Mr. Bridgman has painted--and well painted too--the _Obsequies\r\nof a Mummy upon the Nile_, but why could he not as well have gratified\r\nus with some equally impressive scene from the life of the pioneers in\r\nthe Far West, where wondrous landscape and romantic incident might so\r\nwell combine to furnish a new sensation to the amateurs of London and\r\nParis? Mr. Du Bois deserves our thanks for his _View upon the Hudson_,\r\nand so does Mr. J.B. Bristol for his upon Lake Champlain. The\r\nadmiration which these two pictures have excited, amongst critics as\r\nwell as the public, is evidence enough that these two painters, or Mr.\r\nWyatt Eaton or Mr. Swain Gifford or Mr. Bolton Jones, may, if they so\r\nwill, make American landscape the _mode_ in Europe. Mr. J.M.L.\r\nHamilton has, to say the least, damaged his prospects of success by a\r\nstrangely inconsiderate choice of subject. Critics do not deny that his\r\n_Woman in Black_ is firmly and solidly painted, but they are quite\r\nunanimous in the opinion--in which everybody agrees with them--that the\r\ncomposition is in the worst possible taste. I have a vague recollection\r\nof having seen this painting in Philadelphia, and Americans may\r\nrecognize it by the general description of a woman smoking a cigarette\r\nand holding her knee with both hands. Altogether, it might have been\r\ntolerated in another age and country, which took no offence at the\r\ncoarse manners of Dutch fairs and merrymakings, but we are not living\r\nin the time of the _kermesses_, and Mr. Hamilton, moreover, is not a\r\nHollander, but a Philadelphian.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of Sweden, Norway and Denmark may be said to be, upon\r\nthe whole, less important than that of the United States, and to show,\r\nperhaps, less ability in execution; but it has, upon the other hand, the\r\ncharm of local interest, which the American collection lacks. It is\r\nrefreshing to meet with these honest, simple little pictures of\r\nScandinavian life, with its typical faces and figures, its costumes and\r\ninteriors, all so little known to us, and so delightful from their\r\nnovelty. Amongst the Danish painters we may note especially the names of\r\nExner, Carl Bloch, Kroeger and Bache; and amongst the Swedes, those of\r\nZetterstein, Ross and Hagborg, who follow very closely, in manner and\r\ncomposition, the German school of Duesseldorf.\r\n\r\nArt is migratory. If she sojourns to-day in France, it is but as a guest\r\nwho reposes a while ere she continues her unceasing journey. This\r\nreflection--with which we opened our rapid review of the Exhibition in\r\nthe Champ de Mars--haunts us especially as we linger in the galleries\r\ndevoted to Holland and Italy. Even in those favored lands, where Art\r\nonce seemed to have fixed her eternal abode, the inspiration of genius\r\nis succeeded by the technical skill of the academician. There are\r\nexcellent sea-pieces, by Mesdag and Gabriel in the Dutch gallery, but\r\nItaly, which has fairly crowded her allotted space with canvases, has\r\nnothing to challenge our admiration except a few pretty genre pictures.\r\nM. de Nittis--whom, by the way, we are apt to think of as a Parisian,\r\nbut who is, it appears, Neapolitan--exhibits a dozen pictures quite as\r\n_modern_ in conception as the latest scenes from the comedies of Henri\r\nMeilhac, and which will, one day, serve as valuable documents in the\r\nauthentication of the manners and costume of the present epoch.\r\nConnoisseurs of the twenty-first century will curiously study our\r\ncavalcades in Hyde Park or upon the Brindisi road, the return from the\r\nraces on the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne, and the hundred other\r\nincidents of our every-day life, certified by the signature of Nittis.\r\nClear and brilliant, too, and full of movement and gayety, are the\r\ncompositions of MM. Michetti, Mancini and Delleani (_A Fete on the Grand\r\nCanal_, _The Return from the Fete of the Madonna_, etc.); but the most\r\nremarkable of these little Italian masters is Pasini, the Orientalist.\r\nHis _Suburbs of Constantinople_ and his _Promenade in the Garden of the\r\nHarem_ are pictures on which the eye may feast, so finely drawn are\r\ntheir diminutive figures, so wonderful is their variety of intense\r\ncolor--yellow, blue, green, rose--and so clear and transparent withal,\r\nstartling and amusing us like a display of fireworks.\r\n\r\nIn the English section are plenty of old acquaintances: we have seen\r\nthem at Philadelphia, in London and I know not where besides. Frith's\r\n_Railway Station_ and _Derby Day_ we all remember, so badly realistic\r\nand modern, and the _Casual Ward_ of Fildes--pictures that have gained\r\nin England the popularity and success due to veritable works of art, and\r\nin Paris the sort of praise we should give to a large colored\r\nphotograph--if it were well done. This English school is hardly to our\r\ntaste: Leslie, Leighton, Millais, Orchardson, the painters most in vogue\r\nin their own country, have not succeeded in overcoming the cold\r\nindifference of the public, who pass through the galleries without\r\ncaring even to stop. Whence comes the strange disregard for art in a\r\ncountry which lavishes such vast sums for the encouragement of artists?\r\nHere are canvases which have been covered with gold, but Parisian\r\ncriticism treats them as contemptuously as if they were mere\r\nchromo-lithographs. The English school is severely condemned for its\r\ninharmonious colors, which are either too violent or too cold; for its\r\ndrawing, which is without what we call _distinction_; and for that\r\nunaccountable light which seems to shine through their figures from\r\nwithin, giving many of the heads the appearance of lanterns. Naturally,\r\nProfessor Ruskin comes in for his share of this harsh criticism--which,\r\nI beg my readers to observe, is not ventured as my own, but is only the\r\necho of the opinion of competent authorities, members of the Institute\r\nof France--and the veteran apostle of Pre-Raphaelism is accused of an\r\naffected simplicity, and, at the same time, of an offensive and coarse\r\nrealism, of a mongrel combination of the styles of Courbet and of the\r\nold missals, of a want of perspective, and, in short, of all the faults\r\nwhich mark the contemporary English school.\r\n\r\nIt was only at the last moment that Germany decided to exhibit, and it\r\nwould be hardly fair to judge of the art of that country by the small\r\nnumber of examples on the walls. There are some paintings by M. Knauss\r\nand his followers, however, in whom, if we may accept the opinion of\r\ncertain connoisseurs, is to be found the true representation of the\r\ngenius of the land beyond the Rhine. The subjects are invariably\r\npeasants or children, rendered according to the monotonous processes of\r\nthis school, the shape clearly projected upon a dull and sombre ground,\r\nthe attitudes correct and the gestures faultless, but there is an\r\nabsence of everything brilliant or striking. No one of the attributes\r\nwhich go to make up a good picture is allowed to assert itself above\r\nanother: there is an equalization of many talents, sure of themselves,\r\nand as incapable of weakness or failure as of telling strokes of genius.\r\nOne cannot fail to look with curiosity at the _Furnace_ of M. Menzel, a\r\npicture of much celebrity in Germany, representing an immense foundry\r\nwith its massive framework of iron, its machinery and furnaces, the\r\npowerful glare of light from a melted casting vividly illuminating the\r\nfaces and figures of the workmen. Worthy of mention too are the\r\nportraits of men by the Bavarian Lembach, and Richter's fine portrait of\r\nthe beautiful princess Karolath-Beuthen in a ball-dress of white satin,\r\nseated by the chimney with an enormous house-dog at her feet. Nor must\r\nwe omit the _Baptism after the Death of the Father_ by M. Hoff, the\r\nchief of the Realistic school, and the landscapes of the two Achembachs\r\nand of Breudel and Munthe.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest successes of the Exposition has been achieved by\r\nSpain. M. Pradilla's remarkable composition representing a passage from\r\nthe national history--the mad queen Joanna watching by the corpse of her\r\nhusband, Philip the Handsome--has received a medal of honor. This\r\nimportant painting, which was exhibited at Philadelphia, has attracted\r\nso much attention at Madrid during the past two years that the Chambers\r\nvoted a sum for its acquisition by the state. MM. F. and R. de Madrazzo,\r\nfather and son, who are well known in America, are also represented,\r\nthe former (who is director of the Museum of Madrid) by some admirable\r\nportraits, one of which is especially noticeable. In a large arm-chair\r\ncovered in red reclines a very young girl, whose dress, of a light\r\nrose-color, is nearly of the same tint as her own delicate complexion,\r\nwhile the red carpet at her feet, the carnations and red geraniums upon\r\nthe table, all thrown out boldly upon a background of intense blue,\r\nproduce a strange but wonderfully harmonious effect of color. M.\r\nMadrazzo's eldest daughter was the wife of the young and lamented\r\nFortuny, and her bright and lovely face reappears in many, if not in\r\nmost, of the compositions of her gifted husband.\r\n\r\nFortuny, who sold his first picture to a costermonger in Madrid for a\r\nbag of peas, is represented at the Champ de Mars by several canvases,\r\nthe smallest of which would bring forty thousand francs. His best works\r\nare in France. _The Wedding at the Vicarage_, his chef-d'oeuvre,\r\nbelongs to Madame de Cassin; M. Andre owns his _Serpent-Charmer_; and\r\nthe well-known _Choice of a Model_ and _The Judgment-Hall at Granada_\r\nare in the possession of M. Stewart, the painter's intimate friend,\r\nwhose collection of Fortuny's works is worth, at the current prices of\r\nthe day, not less than six hundred thousand francs. Fortuny's painting\r\nis indescribable. It has the sparkle of diamonds and rubies and emeralds\r\nin the brilliant light of a ball-room. His figures are small, and as\r\nminutely elaborated and as highly finished as those of Meissonier\r\nhimself, whose cherished pupil he was; and I could not but smile, while\r\nexamining them, at the notion of an enthusiastic young Philadelphian, an\r\nalmost idolatrous worshipper of Fortuny, that he could imitate this\r\nincomparable work by a rapid and free sort of sketching, and all on the\r\nfaith of two pictures of the master which he had had the happiness to\r\nsee at an exhibition in Broad street. The immense influence of Fortuny\r\nupon the younger contemporary painters of Spain is very apparent in the\r\nExposition. MM. Rico, Simonetti, Domingo, Melida, Casanova vie with each\r\nother in their imitation of his manner, but, excellent artists as they\r\nare, they are doing so at the expense of originality. The qualities of\r\nFortuny belonged to the nature and temperament of this extraordinary\r\nartist, and are not to be acquired by any amount of labor or by any\r\neffort of will.\r\n\r\nMy favorite corner at the Champ de Mars is here before the sparkling\r\nlittle canvases of the Spanish master. But this prodigality of color\r\nwill sometimes dazzle and fatigue the eye, and turning from it one sees,\r\nframed by the heavy red curtains which enclose the Spanish gallery, the\r\nimmense canvas of the Austrian Hans Makart. This is the _Entry of\r\nCharles V. into Antwerp_. The emperor is surrounded by nearly nude\r\nwomen, who in the midst of horsemen and men-at-arms are offering him\r\nflowers and wreaths. These figures, with those of ladies upon balconies\r\ngay with flags, and the vast architecture, fill this enormous canvas,\r\nwhich is much larger than even the _Catharine Cornaro_ with which the\r\nPhiladelphia Exhibition made Americans familiar. The nudity of the women\r\nmingled with clothed personages in the streets of a city of the\r\nsixteenth century has naturally called forth much adverse criticism, and\r\npeople have fancied that they saw in it an unworthy attempt to achieve a\r\npopular success by means of the scandal; but M. Makart replies that he\r\nhas respected the truth of history if we are not to disbelieve a\r\ncontemporary letter of Albert Duerer to Melanchthon. Be this as it may,\r\nthis great effort receives the applause of the public, notwithstanding\r\nthe monotonous amber tint which pervades this picture as it did the\r\n_Catharine Cornaro_. Another Austrian, the historical painter Matejko,\r\nhas received a medal of honor for pictures full of energy, truth and\r\ncharacter, though marred by that unaccountable scattering of the light\r\nwhich is a peculiar eccentricity of Austrian painters.\r\n\r\n  L. LEJEUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What a glorious, all-satisfying country this Nevada desert would be if\r\none were only all eyes, and had no need of food, drink and shelter!\r\nWouldn't it, Miss Dwyer? Do you know, I've no doubt that this is the\r\ntrue location of heaven. You see, the lack of water and vegetation would\r\nbe no inconvenience to spirits, while the magnificent scenery and the\r\ncloudless sky would be just the thing to make them thrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what I can't get over,\" responded the young lady addressed, \"is\r\nthat these alkali plains, which have been described as so dreary and\r\nuninteresting, should prove to be in reality one of the most wonderfully\r\nimpressive and beautiful regions in the world. What awful fibbers or\r\nwhat awfully dull people they must have been whose descriptions have so\r\nmisled the public! It is perfectly unaccountable. Here, I expected to\r\ndoze all the way across the desert, while, in fact, I've grudged my eyes\r\ntime enough to wink ever since I left my berth this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is,\" replied her companion, \"that persons in search of the\r\npicturesque, or with much eye for it, are rare travellers along this\r\nroute. The people responsible for the descriptions you complain of are\r\nthrifty business-men, with no idea that there can be any possible\r\nattraction in a country where crops can't be raised, timber cut or ore\r\ndug up. For my part, I thank the Lord for the beautiful barrenness that\r\nhas consecrated this great region to loneliness. Here there will always\r\nbe a chance to get out of sight and sound of the swarming millions who\r\nhave already left scarcely standing-room for a man in the East. I\r\nwouldn't give much for a country where there are no wildernesses left.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I really think it is rather hard to say in just what the beauty of\r\nthe desert consists,\" said Miss Dwyer. \"It is so simple. I scribbled two\r\npages of description in my note-book this morning, but when I read them\r\nover, and then looked out of the window, I tore them up. I think the\r\nwonderfully fine, clear, brilliant air transfigures the landscape and\r\nmakes it something that must be seen and can't be told. After seeing how\r\nthis air makes the ugly sagebrush and the patches of alkali and brown\r\nearth a feast to the eye, one can understand how the light of heaven may\r\nmake the ugliest faces beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nThe pretty talker is sitting next the window of palace-car No. 30 of the\r\nCentral Pacific line, which has already been her flying home for two\r\ndays. The gentleman who sits beside her professes to be sharing the\r\nview, but it is only fair I should tell the reader that under this\r\npretence he is nefariously delighting in the rounded contour of his\r\ncompanion's half-averted face as she, in unfeigned engrossment, scans\r\nthe panorama unrolled before them by the swift motion of the car. How\r\nsweet and fresh is the bright tint of her cheek against the ghastly\r\nwhite background of the alkali-patches as they flit by! Still, it can't\r\nbe said that he isn't enjoying the scenery too, for surely there is no\r\nsuch Claude-Lorraine glass to reflect and enhance the beauty of a\r\nlandscape as the face of a spirituel girl.\r\n\r\nWith a profound sigh, summing up both her admiration and that despair of\r\nattaining the perfect insight and sympathy imagined and longed for which\r\nis always a part of intense appreciation of natural beauty, Miss Dwyer\r\nthrew herself back in her seat and fixed her eyes on the car-ceiling\r\nwith an expression as if she were looking at something at least as far\r\naway as the moon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make a statue when I get home,\" she said--\"a statue which\r\nwill personify Nevada and represent the tameless, desolate, changeless,\r\nmagnificent beauty and the self-sufficient loneliness of the desert. I\r\ncan see it in my mind's eye now. It will probably be the finest statue\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd as lieve put your ideal into a painting I will give you a\r\nsuggestion that will be original if nothing else,\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, having in view these white alkali-patches that chiefly\r\ncharacterize Nevada, paint her as a leper.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's horrid! You needn't talk to me any more,\" she exclaimed\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\nWith this sort of chatter they had beguiled the time since leaving San\r\nFrancisco the morning of the day before. Acquaintances are indeed made\r\nas rapidly on an overland train as on an ocean steamship, but theirs had\r\ndated from the preceding winter, during which they had often met in San\r\nFrancisco. When Mr. Lombard heard that Miss Dwyer and Mrs. Eustis, her\r\ninvalid sister, were going East in April, he discovered that he would\r\nhave business to attend to in New York at about that time; and oddly\r\nenough--that is, if you choose to take that view of it--when the ladies\r\ncame to go it turned out that Lombard had taken his ticket for the\r\nselfsame train and identical sleeping-car. The result of which was that\r\nhe had the privilege of handing Miss Dwyer in and out at the\r\neating-stations, of bringing Mrs. Eustis her cup of tea in the car, and\r\nof sharing Miss Dwyer's seat and monopolizing her conversation when he\r\nhad a mind to, which was most of the time. A bright and congenial\r\ncompanion has this advantage over a book, that he or she is an author\r\nwhom you can make discourse on any subject you please, instead of being\r\nobliged to follow an arbitrary selection by another, as when you commune\r\nwith the printed page.\r\n\r\nBy way of peace-offering for his blasphemy in calling the Nevada desert\r\na leper, Lombard had embezzled a couple of chairs from the smoking-room\r\nand carried them to the rear platform of the car, which happened to be\r\nthe last of the train, and invited Miss Dwyer to come thither and see\r\nthe scenery. Whether she had wanted to pardon him or not, he knew very\r\nwell that this was a temptation which she could not resist, for the\r\nrear platform was the best spot for observation on the entire train,\r\nunless it were the cowcatcher of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe April sun mingled with the frosty air like whiskey with ice-water,\r\nproducing an effect cool but exhilarating. As she sat in the door of the\r\nlittle passage leading to the platform she scarcely needed the shawl\r\nwhich he wrapped about her with absurdly exaggerated solicitude. One of\r\nthe most unmistakable symptoms of the lover is the absorbing and\r\nsuperfluous care with which he adjusts the wraps about the object of his\r\naffections whether the weather be warm or cold: it is as if he thought\r\nhe could thus artificially warm her heart toward him. But Miss Dwyer did\r\nnot appear vexed, pretending indeed to be oblivious of everything else\r\nin admiration of the spectacle before her.\r\n\r\nThe country stretched flat and bare as a table for fifty miles on either\r\nside the track--a distance looking in the clear air not over one-fifth\r\nas great. On every side this great plain was circled by mountains, the\r\nreddish-brown sides of some of them bare to the summits, while others\r\nwere robed in folds of glistening snow and looked like white curtains\r\ndrawn part way up the sky. The whitey-gray of the alkali-patches, the\r\nbrown of the dry earth and the rusty green of the sagebrush filled the\r\nforeground, melting in the distance into a purple-gray. The wondrous\r\ndryness and clearness of the air lent to these modest tints a tone and\r\ndazzling brilliance that surprised the eye with a revelation of\r\npossibilities never before suspected in them. But the mountains were the\r\ngreatest wonder. It was as if the skies, taking pity on their nakedness,\r\nhad draped their majestic shoulders in imperial purple, while at this\r\nhour the westering sun tipped their pinnacles with gilt. In the distance\r\nhalf a dozen sand-spouts, swiftly-moving white pillars, looking like\r\ndesert genii with too much \"tanglefoot\" aboard, were careering about in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nBut as Lombard pointed out the various features of the scene to his\r\ncompanion, I fear that his chief motive was less an admiration of Nature\r\nthat sought sympathy than a selfish delight in making her eyes flash,\r\nseeing the color come and go in her cheeks, and hearing her charming\r\nunstudied exclamations of pleasure--a delight not unmingled with\r\ncomplacency in associating himself in her mind with emotions of delight\r\nand admiration. It is appalling, the extent to which spoony young people\r\nmake the admiration of Nature in her grandest forms a mere sauce to\r\ntheir lovemaking. The roar of Niagara has been notoriously utilized as a\r\ncover to unlimited osculation, and Adolphus looks up at the sky-cleaving\r\npeak of Mont Blanc only to look down at Angelina's countenance with a\r\nmore vivid appreciation of its superior attractions.\r\n\r\nIt was delicious, Lombard thought, sitting there with her on the rear\r\nplatform, out of sight and sound of everybody. He had such a pleasant\r\nsense of proprietorship in her! How agreeable--flatteringly so, in\r\nfact--she had been all day! There was nothing like travelling together\r\nto make people intimate. It was clear that she understood his intentions\r\nvery well: indeed, how could she help it? He had always said that a\r\nfellow had shown himself a bungler at lovemaking if he were not\r\npractically assured of the result before he came to the point of the\r\ndeclaration. The sensation of leaving everything else so rapidly behind\r\nthat people have when sitting on the rear platform of a train of cars\r\nmakes them feel, by force of contrast, nearer to each other and more\r\nidentified. How pretty she looked sitting there in the doorway, her eyes\r\nbent so pensively on the track behind as the car-wheels so swiftly\r\nreeled it off! He had tucked her in comfortably. No cold could get to\r\nthe sweet little girl, and none ever should so long as he lived to make\r\nher comfort his care.\r\n\r\nOne small gloved hand lay on her lap outside the shawl. What a jolly\r\nlittle hand it was! He reached out his own and took it, but, without\r\neven a moment's hesitation for him to extract a flattering inference\r\nfrom, she withdrew it. Perhaps something in his matter-of-course way\r\ndispleased her.\r\n\r\nTo know when it is best to submit to a partial rebuff, rather than make\r\na bad matter worse by trying to save one's pride, is a rare wisdom.\r\nStill, Lombard might have exercised it at another time. But there are\r\ndays when the magnetisms are all wrong, and a person not ordinarily\r\ndeficient in tact, having begun wrong, goes on blundering like a\r\nschoolboy. Piqued at the sudden shock to the pleasant day-dream, in\r\nwhich he had fancied himself already virtually assured of this young\r\nlady--a day-dream which she was not really accountable for spoiling,\r\nsince she had not been privy to it--what should he do but find\r\nexpression for his mingled vexation and wounded affection by reminding\r\nher of a previous occasion on which she had allowed him the liberty she\r\nnow denied? Doubtless helping to account for this lack of tact was the\r\nidea that he should thus justify himself for so far presuming just now.\r\nNot, of course, that there is really any excuse for a young man's\r\nforgetting that ladies have one advantage over Omniscience, in that not\r\nonly are they privileged to remember what they please, but also to\r\nignore what they see fit to forget.\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten that evening at the California Theatre,\" was what\r\nthis devoted youth said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know to what you refer, sir,\" she replied freezingly.\r\n\r\nHe was terrified at the distant accent of her voice. It appeared to come\r\nfrom somewhere beyond the fixed stars, and brought the chill of the\r\ninterstellar spaces with it. He forgot in an instant all about his\r\npique, vexation and wounded pride, and was in a panic of anxiety to\r\nbring her back. In a moment more he knew that she would rise from her\r\nchair and remark that it was getting cold and she must go in. If he\r\nallowed her to depart in that mood he might lose her for ever. He could\r\nthink of but one way of convincing her instantaneously of his devotion;\r\nand so what should he do but take the most inopportune occasion in the\r\nentire course of their acquaintance to make his declaration? He was like\r\na general whose plan of battle has been completely deranged by an\r\nutterly unexpected repulse in a preliminary movement, compelling him to\r\nhurry forward his last reserves in a desperate attempt to restore the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\"What have I done, Miss Dwyer? Don't you know that I love you? Won't you\r\nbe my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" she said flatly, her taste outraged and her sensibilities set\r\non edge by the stupid, blundering, hammer-and-tongs onset which from\r\nfirst to last he had made. She loved him, and had meant to accept him,\r\nbut if she had loved him ten times as much she couldn't have helped\r\nrefusing him just then, under those circumstances--not if she died for\r\nit. As she spoke she rose and disappeared within the car.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly to be hoped that the noise of the wheels, which out on\r\nthe platform was considerable, prevented the recording angel from\r\ngetting the full force of Lombard's ejaculation.\r\n\r\nIt is bad enough to be refused when the delicacy and respectfulness of\r\nthe lady's manner make \"No\" sound so much like \"Yes\" that the rejected\r\nlover can almost persuade himself that his ears have deceived him. It is\r\nbad enough to be refused when she does it so timidly and shrinkingly and\r\ndeprecatingly that it might be supposed she were the rejected party. It\r\nis bad enough to be refused when she expresses the hope that you will\r\nalways be friends, and shows a disposition to make profuse amends in\r\ngeneral agreeableness for the consummate favor which she is forced to\r\ndecline you. Not to put too fine a point upon it, it is bad enough to be\r\nrefused anyhow you can arrange the circumstances, but to be refused as\r\nLombard had been, with a petulance as wounding to his dignity as was the\r\nrefusal itself to his affections, is to take a bitter pill with an\r\nasafoetida coating.\r\n\r\nIn the limp and demoralized condition in which he was left the only\r\nclear sentiment in his mind was that he did not want to meet her again\r\njust at present. So he sat for an hour or more longer out on the\r\nplatform, and had become as thoroughly chilled without as he was within\r\nwhen at dusk the train stopped at a little three-house station for\r\nsupper. Then he went into one of the forward day-cars, not intending to\r\nreturn to the sleeping-car till Miss Dwyer should have retired. When the\r\ntrain reached Ogden the next morning; instead of going on East he would\r\ntake the same train back to San Francisco, and that would be the end of\r\nhis romance. His engagement in New York had been a myth, and with Miss\r\nDwyer's \"No, sir,\" the only business with the East that had brought him\r\non this trip was at an end.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after leaving the supper-station the train suddenly\r\nstopped in the midst of the desert. Something about the engine had\r\nbecome disarranged which it would take some time to put right. Glad to\r\nimprove an opportunity to stretch their legs, many of the passengers\r\nleft the cars and were strolling about, curiously examining the\r\nsagebrush and the alkali, and admiring the ghostly plain as it spread,\r\nbare, level and white as an ice-bound polar sea, to the feet of the\r\nfar-off mountains.\r\n\r\nLombard had also left the car, and was walking about, his hands in his\r\novercoat pockets, trying to clear his mind of the wreckage that\r\nobstructed its working; for Miss Dwyer's refusal had come upon him as a\r\nsudden squall that carries away the masts and sails of a vessel and\r\ntransforms it in a moment from a gallant bounding ship to a mere hulk\r\ndrifting in an entangled mass of debris. Of course she had a perfect\r\nright to suit herself about the kind of a man she took for a husband,\r\nbut he certainly had not thought she was such an utter coquette. If ever\r\na woman gave a man reason to think himself as good as engaged, she had\r\ngiven him that reason, and yet she refused him as coolly as she would\r\nhave declined a second plate of soup. There must be some truth, after\r\nall, in the rant of the poets about the heartlessness and fickleness of\r\nwomen, although he had always been used to consider it the merest bosh.\r\nSuddenly he heard the train moving. He was perhaps fifty yards off, and,\r\ngrumbling anathemas at the stupidity of the conductor, started to run\r\nfor the last car. He was not quite desperate enough to fancy being left\r\nalone on the Nevada desert with night coming on. He would have caught\r\nthe train without difficulty if his foot had not happened to catch in a\r\ntough clump of sage, throwing him violently to the ground. As he\r\ngathered himself up the train was a hundred yards off, and moving\r\nrapidly. To overtake it was out of the question.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! ho! stop!\" he yelled at the top of his lungs. But there was no\r\none on the rear platform to see him, and the closed windows and the\r\nrattle of the wheels were sufficient to render a much louder noise than\r\nhe could make inaudible to the dozing passengers. And now the engineer\r\npulled out the throttle-valve to make up for lost time, and the clatter\r\nof the train faded into a distant roar and its lights began to twinkle\r\ninto indistinctness.\r\n\r\n\"Damnation!\"\r\n\r\nA voice fell like a falling star: \"Gentlemen do not use profane language\r\nin ladies' company.\"\r\n\r\nHe first looked up in the air, as on the whole the likeliest quarter for\r\na voice to come from in this desert, then around. Just on the other side\r\nof the track stood Miss Dwyer, smiling with a somewhat constrained\r\nattempt at self-possession. Lombard was a good deal taken aback, but in\r\nhis surprise he did not forget that this was the young lady who had\r\nrefused him that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he replied with a stiff bow: \"I did not suppose\r\nthat there were any ladies within hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got out of the car supposing there was plenty of time to get a\r\nspecimen of sagebrush to carry home,\" she explained, \"but when the cars\r\nstarted, although I was but a little way off, I could not regain the\r\nplatform;\" which, considering that she wore a tie-back of the then\r\nprevalent fashion, was not surprising.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" replied Lombard with the same formal manner.\r\n\r\n\"But won't the train come back for us?\" she asked in a more anxious\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"That will depend on whether we are missed. Nobody will miss me. Mrs.\r\nEustis, if she hasn't gone to bed, may miss you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she has. She went to bed before I left the car, and is asleep by\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's unfortunate,\" was his brief reply as he lit a cigar and began to\r\nsmoke and contemplate the stars.\r\n\r\nHis services, so far as he could do anything for her, she should, as a\r\nlady, command, but if she thought that he was going to do the agreeable\r\nafter what had happened a couple of hours ago, she was mightily\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and then she said, hesitatingly, \"What are we going\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her. Her attitude and the troubled expression of her face\r\nas well as her voice indicated that the logic of the situation was\r\noverthrowing the jaunty self-possession which she had at first affected.\r\nThe desert was staring her out of countenance. How his heart yearned\r\ntoward her! If she had only given him a right to take care of her, how\r\nhe would comfort her! what prodigies would he be capable of to succor\r\nher! But this rising impulse of tenderness was turned to choking\r\nbitterness by the memory of that scornful \"No, sir.\" So he replied,\r\ncoldly, \"I'm not in the habit of being left behind in deserts, and I\r\ndon't know what is customary to do in such cases. I see nothing except\r\nto wait for the next train, which will come along some time within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence, after which she said in a timid voice,\r\n\"Hadn't we better walk to the next station?\"\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of walking he glanced at her close-fitting dress, and\r\na sardonic grin slightly twitched the corners of his mouth as he dryly\r\nanswered, \"It is thirty miles one way and twenty the other to the first\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed before she spoke again, and then she said, with\r\nan accent almost like that of a child in trouble and about to cry, \"I'm\r\ncold.\"\r\n\r\nThe strong, unceasing wind, blowing from snowy mountain-caverns across a\r\nplain on which there was not the slightest barrier of hill or tree to\r\ncheck its violence, was indeed bitterly cold, and Lombard himself felt\r\nchilled to the marrow of his bones. He took off his overcoat and offered\r\nit to her.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, \"you are as cold as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will please take it,\" he replied in a peremptory manner; and she\r\ntook it.\r\n\r\n\"At this rate we shall freeze to death before midnight,\" he added as if\r\nin soliloquy. \"I must see if I can't contrive to make some sort of a\r\nshelter with this sagebrush.\"\r\n\r\nHe began by tearing up a large number of bushes by the roots. Seeing\r\nwhat he was doing, Miss Dwyer was glad to warm her stiffened muscles by\r\ntaking hold and helping; which she did with a vigor that shortly reduced\r\nher gloves to shreds and filled her fingers with scratches from the\r\nrough twigs. Lombard next chose an unusually high and thick clump of\r\nbrush, and cleared a small space three feet across in the centre of it,\r\nscattering twigs on the uncovered earth to keep off its chill.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Dwyer, if you will step inside this spot, I think I can build\r\nup the bushes around us so as to make a sort of booth which may save us\r\nfrom freezing.\"\r\n\r\nShe silently did as he directed, and he proceeded to pile the brush\r\nwhich they had torn up on the tops of the bushes left standing around\r\nthe spot where they were, thus making a circular wall about three feet\r\nhigh. Over the top he managed to draw together two or three bushes, and\r\nthe improvised wigwam was complete.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight penetrated the loose roof sufficiently to reveal to each\r\nother the faces and figures of the two occupants as they sat in opposite\r\ncorners as far apart as possible, she cold and miserable, he cold and\r\nsulky, and both silent. And, as if to mock him, the idea kept recurring\r\nto his mind how romantic and delightful, in spite of the cold and\r\ndiscomfort, the situation would be if she had only said Yes, instead of\r\nNo, that afternoon. People have odd notions sometimes, and it actually\r\nseemed to him that his vexation with her for destroying the pleasure of\r\nthe present occasion was something quite apart and in addition to his\r\nmain grievance against her. It might have been so jolly, and now she had\r\nspoiled it. He could have boxed her pretty little ears.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why he did not try to light a fire, but she wouldn't ask\r\nhim another thing if she died. In point of fact, he knew the sagebrush\r\nwould not burn. Suddenly the wind blew fiercer, there came a rushing\r\nsound, and the top and walls of the wigwam were whisked off like a\r\nflash, and as they staggered to their feet, buffeted by the whirling\r\nbushes, a cloud of fine alkali-dust enveloped them, blinding their eyes,\r\npenetrating their ears and noses, and setting them gasping, sneezing and\r\ncoughing spasmodically. Then, like a puff of smoke, the suffocating\r\nstorm was dissipated, and when they opened their smarting eyes there was\r\nnothing but the silent, glorious desolation of the ghostly desert around\r\nthem, with the snow-peaks in the distance glittering beneath the moon. A\r\nsand-spout had struck them, that was all--one of the whirling\r\ndust-columns which they had admired all day from the car-windows.\r\n\r\nWretched enough before both for physical and sentimental reasons, this\r\nlast experience quite demoralized Miss Dwyer, and she sat down and\r\ncried. Now, a few tears, regarded from a practical, middle-aged point of\r\nview, would not appear to have greatly complicated the situation, but\r\nthey threw Lombard into a panic. If she was going to cry, something must\r\nbe done. Whether anything could be done or not, something _must_ be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"Don't leave me,\" she cried hysterically as he rushed off to reconnoitre\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\n\"I'll return presently,\" he called back.\r\n\r\nBut five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes passed, and he did not\r\ncome back. Terror dried her tears, and her heart almost stopped beating.\r\nShe had quite given him up for lost, and herself too, when with\r\ninexpressible relief she heard him call to her. She replied, and in a\r\nmoment more he was at her side, breathless with running.\r\n\r\n\"I lost my bearings,\" he said. \"If you had not answered me I could not\r\nhave found you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't leave me again,\" she sobbed, clinging to his arm.\r\n\r\nHe put his arms round her and kissed her. It was mean, base,\r\ncontemptible to take advantage of her agitation in that way, but she did\r\nnot resist, and he did it again and again--I forbear to say how many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a perfectly beautiful night?\" he exclaimed with a fine gush of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it exquisite?\" she echoed with a rush of sympathetic feeling.\r\n\r\n\"See those stars: they look as if they had just been polished,\" he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\"What a droll idea!\" she exclaimed gleefully. \"But do see that lovely\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\nHolding her with a firmer clasp, and speaking with what might be styled\r\na fierce tenderness, he demanded, \"What did you mean, miss, by refusing\r\nme this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you go at me so stupidly for? I had to refuse,\" she retorted\r\nsmilingly.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir: I meant to be all the time.\"\r\n\r\nThe contract having been properly sealed, Lombard said, with a\r\ncountenance curiously divided between a tragical expression and a smile\r\nof fatuous complacency, \"There was a clear case of poetical justice in\r\nyour being left behind in the desert to-night. To see the lights of the\r\ntrain disappearing, leaving you alone in the midst of desolation, gave\r\nyou a touch of my feeling on being rejected this afternoon. Of all\r\nleavings behind, there's none so miserable as the experience of the\r\nrejected lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow! so he shouldn't be left behind. He shall be conductor of\r\nthe train,\" she said with a bewitching laugh. His response was not\r\nverbal.\r\n\r\n\"How cold the wind is!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I build you another wigwam?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: let us exercise a little. You whistle 'The Beautiful Blue Danube,'\r\nand we'll waltz. This desert is the biggest, jolliest ball-room floor\r\nthat ever was, and I dare say we shall be the first to waltz on it since\r\nthe creation of the world. That will be something to boast of when we\r\nget home. Come, let's dedicate the Great American Desert to\r\nTerpsichore.\"\r\n\r\nThey stepped out from among the ruins of their sagebrush booth upon a\r\npatch of hard bare earth close to the railroad track. Lombard puckered\r\nhis lips and struck up the air, and off they went with as much\r\nenthusiasm as if inspired by a first-class orchestra. Round and round,\r\nto and fro, they swept until, laughing, flushed and panting, they came\r\nto a stop.\r\n\r\nIt was then that they first perceived that they were not without a\r\ncircle of appreciative spectators. Sitting like statues on their\r\nsniffing, pawing ponies, a dozen Piute Indians encircled them. Engrossed\r\nwith the dance and with each other, they had not noticed them as they\r\nrode up, attracted from their route by this marvellous spectacle of a\r\npale-face squaw and brave engaged in a solitary war-dance in the midst\r\nof the desert.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the grim circle of centaurs around them Miss Dwyer would\r\nhave fainted but for Lombard's firm hold.\r\n\r\n\"Pretend not to see them: keep on dancing,\" he hissed in her ear. He had\r\nno distinct plan in what he said, but spoke merely from an instinct of\r\nself-preservation, which told him that when they stopped the Indians\r\nwould be upon them. But as she mechanically, and really more dead than\r\nalive, obeyed his direction and resumed the dance, and he in his\r\nexcitement was treading on her feet at every step, the thought flashed\r\nupon him that there was a bare chance of escaping violence if they could\r\nkeep the Indians interested without appearing to notice their presence.\r\nIn successive whispers he communicated his idea to Miss Dwyer: \"Don't\r\nact as if you saw them at all, but do everything as if we were alone.\r\nThat will puzzle them, and may make them think us supernatural beings,\r\nor perhaps crazy: Indians have great respect for crazy people. It's our\r\nonly chance. We will stop dancing now, and sing a while. Give them a\r\nburlesque of opera. I'll give you the cues and show you how. Don't be\r\nfrightened. I don't believe they'll touch us so long as we act as if we\r\ndidn't see them. Do you understand? Can you do your part?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand: I'll try,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, and as they separated he threw his hat on the ground,\r\nand, assuming an extravagantly languishing attitude, burst forth in a\r\nmost poignant burlesque of a lovelorn tenor's part, rolling his eyes,\r\nclasping his hands, striking his breast, and gyrating about Miss Dwyer\r\nin the most approved operatic style. He had a fine voice and knew a good\r\ndeal of music; so that, barring a certain nervousness in the performer,\r\nthe exhibition was really not bad. In his singing he had used a\r\nmeaningless gibberish varied with the syllables of the scale, but he\r\nclosed by singing the words, \"Are you ready now? Go ahead, then.\"\r\n\r\nWith that she took it up, and rendered the prima donna quite as\r\neffectively, interjecting \"The Last Rose of Summer\" as an aria in a\r\nmanner that would have been encored in San Francisco. He responded with\r\na few staccato notes, and the scene ended by their rushing into each\r\nother's arms and waltzing down the stage with abandon.\r\n\r\nThe Indians sat motionless on their horses, not even exchanging comments\r\namong themselves. They were evidently too utterly astonished by the\r\ngoings on before them to have any other sentiment as yet beyond pure\r\namazement. Here were two richly-dressed pale-faces, such as only lived\r\nin cities, out in the middle of an uninhabitable desert, in the freezing\r\nmidnight, having a variety and minstrel show all to themselves, and, to\r\nmake the exhibition the more unaccountable, without apparently seeing\r\ntheir auditors at all. Had they started up the show after being\r\ncaptured, Indian cunning would have recognized in it a device to save\r\ntheir lives, but the two had been at it before the party rode up--had,\r\nin fact, first attracted attention by their gyrations, which were\r\nvisible for miles out on the moony plain.\r\n\r\nLombard, without ever letting his eyes rest a moment on the Indians so\r\nas to indicate that he saw them, had still managed by looks askance and\r\nsweeping glances to keep close watch upon their demeanor, and noted with\r\nprodigious relief that his wild scheme was succeeding better than he had\r\ndared to hope. Without any break in the entertainment he communicated\r\nhis reassurance to Miss Dwyer by singing, to the tune of \"My Country,\r\n'tis of Thee,\" the following original hymn:\r\n\r\n          \"We're doing admir'blee--\r\n          They're heap much tickledee:\r\n            Only keep on.\"\r\n\r\nTo which she responded, to the lugubrious air of \"John Brown's Body,\"\r\n\r\n          \"Oh what do you s'pose they'll go for to do,\r\n          Oh what do you s'pose they'll go for to do,\r\n          Oh what do you s'pose they'll go for to do,\r\n            When we can sing no more?\"\r\n\r\nA thing may be ridiculous without being amusing, and neither of these\r\ntwo felt the least inclination to smile at each other's poetry. After\r\nduly joining in the chorus of \"Glory, Hallelujah!\" Lombard endeavored to\r\ncheer his companion by words adapted to the inspiriting air of \"Rally\r\nRound the Flag, Boys,\" This was followed by a series of popular airs,\r\nwith solos, duets and choruses.\r\n\r\nBut this sort of thing could not go on for ever. Lombard was becoming\r\nexhausted in voice and legs, and as for Miss Dwyer, he was expecting to\r\nsee her drop from moment to moment. Indeed, to the air of \"'Way Down\r\nupon the S'wanee River\" she now began to sing,\r\n\r\n          \"Oh dear! I can't bear up much longer:\r\n              I'm tired to death;\r\n          My voice's gone all to pie-ee-ee-ces,\r\n              My throat is very sore.\"\r\n\r\nThey must inevitably give out in a few minutes, and then he--and,\r\nterribly worse, she--would be at the mercy of these bestial savages, and\r\nthis seeming farce would turn into most revolting tragedy. With this\r\nsickening conviction coming over him, Lombard cast a despairing look\r\naround the horizon to see if there were no help in their bitter\r\nextremity. Suddenly he burst forth, to the tune of \"The Star-Spangled\r\nBanner:\"\r\n\r\n          \"Oh, say can you see,\r\n          Far away to the east,\r\n          A bright star that doth grow\r\n          Momentarily brighter?\r\n          'Tis the far-flashing headlight\r\n          Of a railroad-train:\r\n          Ten minutes from now\r\n          We shall be safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\nWhat they did in those ten minutes neither could tell afterward. The\r\nsame idea was in both their minds--that unless the attention of the\r\nIndians could be held until the train arrived, its approach would only\r\nprecipitate their own fate by impelling the savages to carry out\r\nwhatever designs of murder, insult or capture they might have. Under the\r\ninfluence of the intense excitement of this critical interval it is to\r\nbe feared that the performance degenerated from a high-toned concert and\r\nvariety show into something very like a Howling-Dervish exhibition. But,\r\nat any rate, it answered its purpose until, after a period that seemed\r\nlike a dozen eternities, the West-bound overland express with a\r\ntremendous roar and rattle drew up beside them, in response to the\r\nwaving of Miss Dwyer's handkerchief and to Lombard's shouts.\r\n\r\nEven had the Indians contemplated hostile intentions--which they were\r\ndoubtless in a condition of too great general stupefaction to do--the\r\nalacrity with which the two performers clambered aboard the cars would\r\nprobably have foiled their designs. But as the train gathered headway\r\nonce more Lombard could not resist the temptation of venting his\r\nfeelings by shaking his fist ferociously at the audience which he had\r\nbeen so conscientiously trying to please up to that moment. It was a\r\ngratification which had like to have cost him dear. There was a quick\r\nmotion on the part of one of the Indians, and the conductor dragged\r\nLombard within the car just as an arrow struck the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eustis had slept sweetly all night, and was awakened the next\r\nmorning an hour before the train reached Ogden by the sleeping-car\r\nporter, who gave her a telegram which had overtaken the train at the\r\nlast station. It read:\r\n\r\n     \"Am safe and sound. Was left behind by your train last night, and\r\n     picked up by West-bound express. Will join you at Ogden to-morrow\r\n     morning.\"\r\n\r\n  \"JENNIE DWYER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Eustis read the telegram through twice without getting the least\r\nidea from it. Then she leaned over and looked down into Jennie's berth.\r\nIt had not been slept in. Then she began to understand. Heroically\r\nresisting a tendency to scream, she thus secured space for second\r\nthought, and, being a shrewd woman of the world, ended by making up her\r\nmind to tell no one about the matter. Evidently, Jennie had been having\r\nsome decidedly unconventional experience, and the less publicity given\r\nto all such passages in young ladies' lives the better for their\r\nprospects. It so happened that in the bustle attending the approach to\r\nthe terminus and the prospective change of cars everybody was too busy\r\nto notice that any passengers were missing. At Ogden, Mrs. Eustis left\r\nthe train and went to a hotel. The following morning, a few minutes\r\nafter the arrival of the Central Pacific train, Jennie Dwyer walked into\r\nher room, Lombard having stopped at the office to secure berths for the\r\nthree to Omaha by the Union Pacific. After Jennie had given an outline\r\naccount of her experiences, and Mrs. Eustis's equilibrium had been\r\nmeasurably restored by proper use of the smelling-salts, the latter lady\r\nremarked, \"And so Mr. Lombard was alone with you there all night? It's\r\nvery unfortunate that it should have happened so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I was thinking it very fortunate,\" replied Jennie with her most\r\nchild-like expression. \"If Mr. Lombard had not been there, I should\r\neither have frozen to death or by this time been celebrating my\r\nhoneymoon as bride of a Piute chief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, child! You know what I mean. People will talk: such\r\nunpleasant things will be said! I wouldn't have had it happen for\r\nanything. And when you were under my charge too! Do hand me my salts.\"\r\n\r\n\"If people are going to say unpleasant things because I pass a night\r\nalone with Mr. Lombard,\" remarked Jennie with a mischievous smile, \"you\r\nmust prepare yourself to hear a good deal said, my dear, for I presume\r\nthis won't be the last time it will happen. We're engaged to be\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n  EDWARD BELLAMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMBLING TALK ABOUT THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat guides the bee when, turning from the \"suck,\" he wheels in air and\r\nstrikes his wonderful line for the \"gum\"? Heaven knows. And by what\r\nprocess does the negro calculate the shortest distance between the point\r\nhe occupies and the place he would be? That also is a mystery, yet the\r\nleast observant person familiar with the negro cannot have failed to\r\nnote his wonderful--we had almost said his preternatural--power to\r\ndiscover, without guide or compass, the shortest possible distance\r\nbetween two given places--to make, as he calls it, a \"near cut.\"\r\n\r\nTo the right of us lay a berry and wild-fruit tract, on our left was a\r\nlarge village, and our farm was in a certain portion skirted by an old\r\nfield, through which the negroes had discovered the most direct path to\r\nmarket. At dawn they could be seen winding around the brow of the hill,\r\nmen, women and children, with baskets on their heads and buckets on\r\ntheir arms, singly and in couples, sometimes three, four or a half dozen\r\ntogether. And how they stole from us! It seemed impossible to prevent,\r\nor even limit, their depredations.\r\n\r\nOne evening Mr. Smith said to me, \"The man Tony is sentenced to be\r\nhung.\"\r\n\r\nTony was a village negro accused of murder, and as he had been confined\r\nin the village jail and tried at the village court-house, the case\r\nnaturally created some excitement in our quiet neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am so sorry!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, poor devil!\" said Mr. Smith. \"But it was a clear case. He belonged\r\nto Mr. Lamkin before the surrender, and the old man made every effort to\r\nget him off--employed the very best counsel. I am sorry for him, but the\r\nwind which is so ill for him will blow us good. He is to be hung in the\r\nold field that edges our farm, and after the execution takes place we\r\nshall have no more negro trespassers in that quarter. I very much doubt\r\nwhether I shall be able to obtain hands to work that portion of the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nIt would require a psychological study of the negro character to enable\r\none to explain the spirit in which they flocked to the execution of\r\ntheir comrade, their friend, in some instances their kinsman. They came\r\nin holiday attire and with hurrying steps, and long before the hour\r\nappointed the adjoining fence was crowded with eager spectators, and,\r\nlike flocks of blackbirds, they had filled every tree within five\r\nhundred yards, chatting and bustling and moving around with no apparent\r\nemotion except the desire to see.\r\n\r\nAt length the cart appeared on the brow of the hill, and every neck was\r\ncraned for a glimpse of the poor creature who sat on the coffin--a\r\npitiful-looking, half-dwarf mulatto, who gave you the idea of deformity\r\nand distress without your being able to tell why. He walked bravely to\r\nhis place on the scaffold, singing and praying, protesting his innocence\r\nand bequeathing forgiveness to his enemies, apparently full of faith,\r\nlike many others who by reason of weariness and despair have attained\r\nresignation; but the fictitious piety born of nervous excitement, and\r\nthe abnormal elevation of feeling induced by continued spiritual\r\nexhortation during weeks of unrest and suspense, both gave way when his\r\nold mother, unsightly and pitiful as himself, asked leave to bid him\r\ngood-bye, and came tottering to his side, saying as well as she could\r\nfor the tears that choked her, \"Oh, Tony! mammy ain't gwine back on you!\r\nMammy don't b'lieve you done it, she don't keer who 'kuses you.\r\nGood-bye, my baby! good-bye! 'Twon't be long 'fo' mammy jines you an'\r\ndaddy whar dar ain't no onjestice an' no mizry. Mammy ain't gwine to\r\nstay here long arter you goes.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw up his arms with a wild, sobbing cry: \"Oh, mammy! mammy! can't\r\nyou do nothin' fer me? Ain't you got _no_ way to he'p me? Oh, de sun do\r\nshine so pretty, an' de leaves shakes 'bout on de trees so natchul! An'\r\nI nuvver knowed de birds to sing like dey does to-day. It ain't\r\nfa'r--no, it's not fa'r to shet me up in de groun' for what I ain't\r\ndone. So many 'ginst one, an' me so little an' so po'! I ain't got a\r\nfren' on top o' de yuth. Nary one outen all dese folks, what I use ter\r\ngo to shuckin's wid 'em, an' play de banjer, an' hunt possums--nary one\r\nuv 'em didn't stand up for me an' try to git me off! Not eben you,\r\nmammy, didn't try to git in jail an' gimme somethin' to wu'k my way out,\r\nan' I a-lis'nin' night an' day! Night an' day, an' you nuvver come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord! Lord! my baby!\" sobbed the poor old thing, her trembling limbs\r\nhardly able to sustain the feeble frame. \"What could yo' ole mammy do\r\n'ginst all dem folks? Ef Mars' Henry couldn't make 'em let you 'lone,\r\nwhat could a po' ole nigger do what ain't got no money, an' no sense,\r\nan' no fren's? Lord! Lord! my blessed chile!\" she sobbed, the tears\r\nraining down her withered black cheeks, \"ef mammy had a hundred nakes\r\nshe would put dat rope 'roun' 'em all to keep it off o' your'n.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true, poor soul! but could avail nothing, and the appointed\r\nsentence was carried into execution. The soul of the boy returned to its\r\nCreator and its Judge, and the old mother was taken to her cabin almost\r\nas lifeless as the body that swung in the air half a mile away.\r\n\r\nIf the fact that they flocked to the place of execution cannot be\r\nascribed to any idiosyncrasy of the negro race, it was curious to see\r\nhow they were afterward overwhelmed with superstitious fear. We had no\r\nmore trouble about the melons and grapes. The negroes found another\r\nroute to the village market, and the little well-worn path became\r\novergrown with grass and ox-eyed daisies, like the rest of the old\r\nfield. Even after the body had been buried far off and the scaffold\r\nremoved, in broad daylight they shunned the place, but at dusk or after\r\ndark neither bribery nor persuasion could have induced one of them to\r\ngo near it. Mr. Smith tried some of them.\r\n\r\n\"But what the d----l are you afraid of?\" he asked impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I dunno, sir,\" returned one of the men doggedly. \"All I does know is, I\r\nain't gwine (no disrespek, sir). But when a man is took off dat\r\nonnateral kind o' way, de sperrit is always hangin' 'roun', tryin' to\r\ngit back whar it come from.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Tony is buried a mile away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help dat, sir. De sperrit were let out in de ole field, an'\r\nmaybe it don't know whar to find the pusson it 'longs to. Anyhow, ef it\r\ncome back dar lookin' for Tony, I gwine take good keer it don't find\r\n_me_!\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing eccentricity of feeling, certainly a very nice distinction,\r\nwas shown during slave times by a woman belonging to a friend of ours.\r\nSome disturbance had taken place on the premises of a neighbor, Mr.\r\nH----, who, being a severe old man, forthwith forbade that any negro\r\nshould again visit his place. This result was very dispiriting to Judy,\r\nthe slave above referred to, for she had a cousin belonging to Mr. H----\r\nto whom she was in the habit of paying frequent visits, and for whom she\r\nfelt undoubtedly very great affection; and as time passed and Mr. H----\r\ncontinued implacable, her indignation grew and her wrath waxed exceeding\r\nstrong. It came to pass that the cousin one night fared over-sumptuously\r\non cold cabbage and beans, and when the mists of dawn had fled she too\r\nhad left to join her friends over Jordan.\r\n\r\nPresently a messenger came from Mr. H----: \"Would Mrs. S---- be so kind\r\nas to allow Judy to come over and prepare the body for burial?\"--that\r\nbeing one of Judy's specialties.\r\n\r\nThe family was at table when the message was delivered, and Judy was\r\nserving cakes and muffins, with short parentheses sacred to the memory\r\nof her cousin. Mrs. S---- had respected her affliction and given her\r\npermission to retire, but Judy continued to return with more cakes and\r\nmore muffins, and, as soon as they were handed, to retire to a corner\r\nwith her apron at her eyes, even after Mr. H----'s message had been\r\ndelivered and she had been told to go. During one of her temporary\r\nabsences Mr. S---- asked his wife, \"Why don't you tell her to go, if she\r\nis going? It seems nobody can be 'laid out' without Judy, but any of the\r\nrest can wait at table.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is her cousin, and she may not wish to perform so trying a\r\nservice; so I will leave it to her.--Judy, if you prefer not going to\r\nMr. H----'s just at present, I will send word that I cannot spare you.\"\r\n\r\nJudy threw her apron over her head with a vari-toned cry issued in the\r\nkeys of grief, anger and scorn. Then she stiffened her neck and rolled\r\nher eyes from side to side till the whites glistened again. \"Go dar,\r\nindeed!\" she indignantly exclaimed. \"Ef I couldn't go on de lot to see\r\nmy own dear cousin, I know I ain't gwine to dress up his dead nigger!\"\r\n\r\nThe leading trait of the negro is his instability, his superficiality.\r\nIt is superlative. His emotions are as easily aroused and as evanescent\r\nas those of children, flowing in a noisy and tumultuous current, but\r\nutterly without depth and volatile as ether. To this may in a measure be\r\nattributed his lack of progress, but I doubt whether he be capable of\r\nany high order of development without an infusion of Caucasian blood\r\nwhich will dissipate his simian type, improving the shape of his\r\nretreating forehead, changing the contour of his heavy jaw, giving\r\nweight and measurement to his now inferior and inactive brain. Since the\r\nsurrender and the institution of public schools, and the opportunities\r\nfor improvement afforded him, we seem to have all around us evidence of\r\nthis utter instability of character. Never since the world began has he\r\nhad, and never will he have again, the incentives and aids to\r\nimprovement which at that time fell into his hands. There was, as one\r\nspur to ambition, the spirit of resentment which he was supposed\r\nnaturally to entertain at having been kept in servitude by even the\r\nkindest of masters; but the negro is amiable and forgiving, and not only\r\nduring but after the war conducted himself with admirable good feeling\r\nand moderation. Granting, then, that he indulged no feeling of\r\nresentment, there must have been, should have been, there was, a\r\nsentiment of rivalry with the whites which was pardonable and proper to\r\nthe most amiable and forgiving nature; and at first the young negroes\r\napplied themselves with assiduity, and learned with an avidity which\r\ndelighted some classes, and was no doubt a discomfiting surprise to\r\nothers. It was astonishing to see the rapidity with which they mastered\r\nthe alphabet of progress, and white mothers said to their indolent or\r\nrefractory children, \"Are you not ashamed to see little negroes more\r\nstudious than yourself, making even greater progress according to their\r\nadvantages, and in matters with which you should be already familiar?\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on even the indolent or refractory white boy to some extent\r\nimproved, and seemed conditionally sure of further improvement; but the\r\nnegro, having arrived at a certain point--and that usually no high\r\none--seemed incapable of further progress, as a man, though not\r\nafflicted with dimness of vision, is prevented by natural causes from\r\nseeing beyond the horizon. Doubtless the spirit of rivalry already\r\nmentioned, born of defiance and resentment in a mild form, was to some\r\nextent the incentive to application, and its brief duration serves to\r\nillustrate the instability of which we speak. Doubtless, also, many\r\nothers, by reason of poverty, which necessitated manual labor, were\r\nunable to continue the pursuit of an education to any great advantage;\r\nbut what numbers of white children, by the losses of war placed on the\r\nsame footing--placed identically on the same footing, because they also\r\nand their parents were compelled to earn by labor their daily\r\nbread--have yet continued to improve! The negro had the same privilege\r\nof night study and (immediately after the war) as many teachers at his\r\nservice as any white child. He had also one advantage over the white: he\r\nhad never learned the difference between _meum_ and _tuum_, and the\r\nsilver lining to this cloud of ignorance lay in the fact that he was\r\nthereby enabled more speedily to increase his store of worldly goods,\r\nthus leaving time for greater devotion to the particular of mental\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nBut take the minority of instances, where every advantage has been given\r\nhim; where, freed from the relations of master and slave, he has been\r\nthrown with whites and the spirit of emulation naturally excited; where\r\nhis parents have made every sacrifice necessary to procure him tutors\r\n(numbers of them had private teachers, and very competent ones too, just\r\nafter the war) and books and all the paraphernalia of learning, and even\r\nthe best social position possible to him in the section where he\r\nhappened to be, themselves retreating into the background with the\r\npathetic humility and self-abnegation of parents who believe and desire\r\ntheir offspring to be of a higher order than themselves,--does the\r\nhighest culture of which he seems capable make him more than the peer of\r\nthe mediocre white? I and hundreds of others have read with pleasure the\r\nspeech of Rev. William D. Johnson, A.M., colored delegate to the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Conference which some months ago met in Georgia. It\r\nwas a good speech for a colored man--a capitally, wonderfully good\r\nspeech--and I applaud it with cordial pleasure and reciprocation of the\r\ngood feeling which pervades it; but is it more than the address of the\r\naverage white? As the address of any one of the white members would it\r\nhave been reported, or have attracted attention, save for its animus?\r\n\r\nThere are exceptional cases among the negroes as among the whites; but\r\nbecause we have a Cuvier, a Webster, a Dupuytren, are we prepared to\r\nassert as a general fact that the brain of the white man weighs\r\nsixty-four ounces? And I speak of the negroes as a class. I refer to the\r\nnegro of the South, not to the barbarian of Africa, who really exists,\r\nnor to the negro of the Northern mind, who is only \"founded on fact.\" I\r\nrefer to the negro as he is in our day and generation, not as he will or\r\nmay be after centuries of revolution in his circumstances which will\r\nproduce Heaven knows what changes in his mental, moral and physical\r\nnature. Many believe that these negroes, whom and whose children we have\r\ncivilized, having with their freedom received ideas of social equality\r\nand personal ambition which except in isolated cases can never be\r\nrealized on this continent, will gradually return, as in South Carolina\r\nthey are now doing, to their original land, and thus eventually civilize\r\ntheir own race. Were they to return in a body, they would all probably\r\nrelapse into barbarism, but if a clear stream be kept running, though\r\nthe pool through which it flow be stagnant, it will in time become pure.\r\nAnd there is material in this country for a pretty continuous flow.\r\n\r\nI do not say that the negro is incapable of progress, but his mental\r\nhorizon is very limited, and seems bounded by natural causes as\r\nimmovable (except by aid of foreign blood, which having he ceases to be\r\na genuine negro) as the chains of mountains which in some localities\r\nlimit the horizon in material Nature; and that as a people they will\r\nbecome the peer of the white race is simply impossible, for if progress\r\nbe a law of Nature, it will be obeyed by the white man also, and he is\r\nalready centuries ahead of the black, with advantages of every possible\r\nnature. Also, that they should now be competent to fill the offices many\r\nof them occupy is a pure absurdity, as demonstrated all around us--at\r\nthe polls, in the jury-box, in the chair of the magistrate. A very cruel\r\nabsurdity it has sometimes proved.\r\n\r\nBut speaking of their mercurial nature: I was once spending the summer\r\nat a village in the mountains, and not far from my chamber-window were\r\nthree or four cabins occupied by very cleanly, orderly negroes, who had\r\nhitherto been a source of no annoyance, for I am very fond of negroes\r\nand like to have them about me. These cabins were situated near the\r\nmouth of a deep ravine heavily wooded and producing echoes of beautiful\r\ndistinctness. One evening negroes began to assemble in and around the\r\nlargest cabin, and there was evidently to be a meeting of some very\r\nmournful--or at any rate solemn--character, for they came quietly, shook\r\nhands silently, and crept into their places with a stealthy gliding\r\nmotion. It was a weird, uncanny scene. The moon rose slowly behind the\r\ngreat black mountains, and cast its rays upon the tree-tops and\r\nshimmered its light on the whitewashed cabins, and only half revealed\r\nthe dark figures that glided like spectres in and out; but nothing could\r\npierce the depths of that black ravine, and it was easy to believe it\r\nthe abode of spirits blest or otherwise--especially otherwise. There was\r\na long, oppressive silence: then they began to sing. What remarkable\r\nvoices they have, especially the men--so full, so rich, so deep and\r\nsonorous! If the mental development of the negro is to involve change in\r\nhis physical conformation, it is to be hoped it will not interfere with\r\nhis chest and lungs, nor with that wonderful cavern in the back of his\r\nmouth and at the base of the nose. Some should be kept barbarians that\r\nthey may continue to be vocal instruments. No one who has heard him only\r\nas a \"minstrel\" can have any conception of the exquisite mournfulness,\r\nthe agonizing pathos, which the negro voice is capable of expressing;\r\nnor, we may fairly add, of the wild, devil-may-care jollity; but this\r\nlast is more truly represented on the stage, the invariable adjuncts of\r\ncaricature not only contributing to stimulate the comedian, but\r\nbroadening the effect of his voice on the hearer. Why is it that we\r\nalways have caricature in negro delineations--that we never have any\r\nsimple representations of the reality or any touches of unalloyed\r\npathos? In all Nature there is nothing more pathetic than a pitiful\r\nnegro. You may paint the negro's lips and roach his hair, and even\r\nexaggerate the peculiarities of his feet, but I can pick you up one, out\r\non the suburbs or down in the alleys, who has become old and feeble and\r\ncannot work any more, whose old master is dead and whose children have\r\nkicked him out, who steals and struggles and starves in ignorant terror\r\nof the poorhouse; and for yours people will raise their opera-glasses to\r\ntheir eyes--for mine, their handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Oh how inexpressibly mournful were their chants that\r\nnight! I remember one especially. It began with a wailing recitative--a\r\nprolonged, mournful recitative in the minor key by female voices only,\r\nand at its close the men joined them in a full, deep chorus, slow and\r\nsolemn, the last words of which were \"Dead and gone!\" The black ravine\r\ntook up the sound, and from its deep, mysterious heart came back the\r\nsolemn echo, \"Dead and gone!\" It was simply horrible. I never felt so\r\nhomesick in my life; and as the mournful chant rolled toward the\r\nmountain, and then came floating back again like a corpse upon the\r\nebbing tide, I leaned my head upon the window-sill and cried heartily.\r\nOne by one my friends died and were buried, my children became orphans,\r\nand, by a curious freak of circumstances, their father and I were left\r\nto a childless old age. All possible accidents were put in requisition,\r\nall manner of possible misfortunes called upon to contribute their quota\r\nof woe. Then I fell to wondering how people could like to sing mournful\r\nthings and make themselves and other people miserable; and that made me\r\nthink of what negroes liked, and that naturally led to watermelons; so I\r\ndried my eyes and summoned my maid: \"Betty, what is it they are singing\r\nabout? Is anybody dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's de las' en' of a funerul, I b'lieve, m'm--somebody whar dey didn't\r\ngit done preachin' over him, 'count of a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Betty, the singing does make me feel so badly. Just step over and say I\r\nwill send them a barrel of watermelons and cantaloupes, and those Mrs.\r\nBrown sent me too, if they will get up a dance or make any kind of\r\ncheerful noise. There is a tambourine among the children's toys: you can\r\nbeat it as you go.\"\r\n\r\nBetty laughed, and went over. There was a pause in the singing: then I\r\nheard a man's voice: \"Go 'way wid dat fool talk! Whar she gwine git\r\nwatermillions an' mushmillions by de bar'l, an' dey ain't more'n fa'rly\r\nripe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smith sent 'em from de city,\" simpered Betty, who liked to put on\r\nairs with the country-folk; \"an' Mrs. Brown, of your nabority, reposed\r\nher some to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat's so 'bout dem from town, 'cos I helped to tote 'em up to de\r\nhouse,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"Huk kum she ain't et 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"The baby conwulshed, an' Mrs. Smith's mind disbegaged of de melons,\"\r\nreplied Betty.\r\n\r\n\"Huk kum he sen' so many?\" asked the first speaker, who appeared to be\r\nbusiness-manager, and duly afraid of being swindled--fervid in fair\r\nspeech, and correspondingly suspicious. \"His wife mus' be a mons'ous\r\nhearty 'ooman!\"\r\n\r\n\"He knowed she were goin' to resperse 'em to her village fren's too, of\r\ncourse. Which we all know dere ain't no place where you carn't\" (Betty\r\nwas from Cumberland county, and pronounced the _a_ broad, to the envious\r\ndisgust of the Rockbridge darkies) \"git fruit like you carn't git it in\r\nthe country. It is always five miles off, an' de han's is busy, or de\r\ncreek is riz an' you carn't cross it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now, town-nigger, we don't want none o' yo' slack-jaw; an' ain't\r\ngwine take it, nudder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mos' incertny not,\" sang out a high-pitched female voice from some\r\nunseen point.\r\n\r\n\"Comin' here wid yo' half-white talk an' half-nigger!\"\r\n\r\n\"But who'll git up de fus' larf?\" inquired the metropolitan, suavely\r\nwaiving personal discussion.\r\n\r\n\"Yo' git de 'millions, an' de laf's boun' ter foller. Don't be skeered\r\n'bout de laf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his veracity proved unimpeachable, for as the melons were\r\ndistributed the air became vocal with rude wit and noisy laughter, and\r\nthe deep ravine gave back loud \"yah-yahs\" which sounded truly demoniac\r\nin the darkness, and were no doubt the reproachful, sneering laughter of\r\nthe late lamented, whose obsequies were for the second time\r\nabbreviated--the resentful, mocking laughter of him who was \"dead and\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\nBut the negro, as said before, has one advantage over his impecunious\r\nwhite brother--a genius for theft. The white man may not have, as a\r\ngeneral thing, sterner principle or a softer conscience, but it cannot\r\nbe said, except in isolated cases, that he has a passion for stealing.\r\nThe Chinaman is regarded by severe moralists as somewhat lax in the\r\nmatter of honesty, and indeed, to be candid, he has been accused of\r\ncultivating theft as one of the fine arts; but even he has the grace to\r\nbe, or to affect to be, ashamed of it, and indignantly resentful at\r\nbeing suspected of the immorality. The negro, on the other hand, is only\r\nterribly afraid of being punished, and on being forgiven feels\r\nimmediately purified and free from sin. He has, in fact, no moral\r\nprinciple, and his code of honesty is comprised in a conversation I\r\noverheard this winter. Our youngest child seemed to have a vague,\r\nindefinite fear of rogues, and a very imperfect idea of what a rogue\r\nmight be, and was always asking questions on the subject. One morning,\r\nwhile his nurse was dressing him, I heard him inquire, \"How big is a\r\nrogue, Betty? Can he hear a mile?\"\r\n\r\nBefore she could reply, his brother, very little older, rose to explain:\r\n\"Why, Bob, you've seen a many a rogue. A rogue is thes' a man. Papa an'\r\nUncle Bob looks ezactly like other rogues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is papa an' Unker Bob rogues?\" asked the youngest with innocent wonder.\r\n\r\n\"No, chile--dat dey ain't!\" said Betty as she filled his eyes with soap.\r\n\"Yo' papa an' yo' uncle Borb is jes' as ornes' as anybody, 'cos rogues\r\nis folks what steals an' _gits cotch_!\"\r\n\r\n  JENNIE WOODVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFTER-DINNER SPEECH OF THE BARONESS CONTALETTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the most salubrious sections of Alaska there exists--or did\r\nexist in December, 1876--a society named \"The Irreparables.\" It was\r\ncomposed of women only. For this there were several reasons. The\r\nsubjects discussed were not supposed to interest men, but this might\r\nhave been remedied had not the men, already in a minority in the\r\nvillage, absolutely refused to have anything to do with a society in\r\nwhich they were sure to be voted down without any very promising power\r\nof appeal. It was at one time suggested that they could become associate\r\nmembers, but the notary, upon examining their prospective position in\r\nthe club, declared that their taxes would be so many and their rights so\r\nfew that it was an offer not to be considered. So the matter was\r\ndropped, and an \"Irreparable\" was always a creature of the gentler sex.\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the year to this society was its annual\r\nmeeting and festive celebration in December. Upon this occasion the\r\nmembers reviewed their accounts, perhaps voted in a new member, acted\r\nupon delinquents, and, in a word, settled up the business of the year.\r\nThe festivities sometimes took the shape of a mothers' meeting, a\r\nquilting-party or a cozy little tea. In 1876 they were, however,\r\naffected by the excitement that prevailed throughout the whole United\r\nStates, and which fairly reached them in December. Alaska, it was true,\r\nwas not one of the thirteen colonies, but neither was Ohio nor Colorado.\r\nIt was much larger than Rhode Island or Delaware. It had great\r\npossibilities, and it had cost money, which was more than could be said\r\nof the original thirteen, leaving out Pennsylvania, which even then\r\ncould not be counted as a very expensive investment on the part of Mr.\r\nPenn. These patriotic reasons fired the hearts of the \"Irreparables,\"\r\nand they determined that Alaska should celebrate the Centennial of their\r\ncountry, and that the celebration should be theirs.\r\n\r\nThen the question arose of what nature this celebration should be. An\r\nExposition was clearly out of the question, and even a school-fair was\r\nvoted troublesome. Some of the younger members favored a dance, but this\r\nwas objected to, because of the absurdity of a roomful of women waltzing\r\nand treading the light, fantastic German by themselves. It would seem,\r\nsaid the Baroness Contaletto, like a burlesque of merriment; and so the\r\ndance fell through. A service of song, a tea-drum, a cream-cornet, and a\r\npound-party met the same fate; and finally all minds gently but firmly\r\ncentred upon a dinner-party; and so it _was_ a dinner with courses.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, it was not at first easy to arrange, but the admirable\r\nspirit of organization pervading the society soon brought everything\r\ninto shape. There was a committee upon the bill of fare, upon the\r\ntoasts, upon invitations, upon the room and upon the general\r\narrangements. It was true that the only room in the village that was\r\nsuitable was the little hall back of the tavern, and the invitations\r\nwere verbally given at the meeting when the matter was decided upon; but\r\nas one never knows what emergencies may arise, it is always well to have\r\na committee ready to act.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman of most of the committees was the Baroness Contaletto.\r\nThis was not because of her rank, as, in fact, she had no claim to her\r\ntitle either from birthright or marriage. Her claim rested upon the fine\r\nsense the village had of the fitness of things. She _looked_ like a\r\nbaroness: she always made it a point to behave like one. In the course\r\nof time they called her so, and when she added the name of Contaletto,\r\nthe village acknowledged the fitness of _that_, and very soon the\r\nBaroness Contaletto was universally accepted, and Thisba Lenowski\r\nforgotten. The reason of her being so many chairwomen also rested on her\r\nfitness. She was a woman of ideas and of deeds. The minister's plans\r\nmight come to naught, the editor's predictions be falsified, and the\r\nschoolmaster's reforms die out; but the enterprises undertaken by the\r\nbaroness went through to a swift success. Her ideas were both contagious\r\nand epidemic, and she was always a known quantity in the place.\r\n\r\nAnd so when she pooh-poohed the dance, laughed at the tea-drum and\r\nshivered at the idea of the cream-cornet, declaring for the dinner, the\r\nmatter was settled, and each of the younger members promptly decided who\r\nshe would ask to escort her and deliberated as to what she should wear.\r\n\r\nThen the baroness arose. She glanced around. She read the thoughts of\r\nthe members. She looked at two women. One was the sister of the county\r\nclerk: she was a woman of the most appreciative character, the clearest\r\nsense, and--she was the faithful echo of the baroness. The second was a\r\npretty girl. She represented the other pretty girls. Then the baroness\r\nspoke. She said it was of the first importance to do this thing\r\ndecorously and in order. When men had suppers they never invited women.\r\nThey wanted to have a good time, and women spoiled it. She was not in\r\nfavor of an \"invitation entertainment.\" She supposed that what they\r\nwanted was a society, an \"Irreparable,\" dinner. Therefore, _she_ did not\r\npropose to invite men.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the pretty girl, with a rosy color mounting to her cheeks\r\nand an ominous flash in her eyes, \"when I was in New Moscow _I_ was\r\ninvited to the Hercules dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the table?\" asked the baroness.\r\n\r\n\"Well--no,\" replied the pretty girl.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get anything to eat?\" pursued the baroness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" answered the victim, as if this was something preposterous--\"of\r\ncourse I didn't. We did not expect anything. But I had a splendid seat,\r\nand I heard all the toasts and everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That _was_ very nice,\" answered the baroness, grimly; \"but I think we\r\ncan do quite as well. We will invite the gentlemen to the\r\ngallery--fortunately, there is one--we will have toasts, and _we_ will\r\nbe very entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the baroness had her way. Here, at once, was an advantage in\r\nthe absence of associate members. Rosy cheeks and pretty eyes now\r\ncounted in the society for nothing, and when the sister of the county\r\nclerk promptly moved that no gentleman be invited to the floor, the\r\nsexton's wife seconded the motion. It was carried, and on the night\r\nappointed the \"Irreparables\" had their dinner, and up in the gallery sat\r\nthe minister, the sheriff, the county clerk, the editor of the\r\n_Snow-Drift_, the head-teacher and a dozen other gentlemen, all in\r\nstrict evening--if still Alaskian--toilettes. At first it was funny.\r\nThen it wasn't funny. It became tiresome, and the sheriff went away. His\r\nboots creaked, the ladies looked up, and then not a married man but\r\nsmiled delightedly and settled himself in his seat.\r\n\r\nThey paid much attention to the wine. It had been bought in New Moscow\r\nof the Hercules Club, and was of course all right. Yet it was over the\r\nwine that the county clerk grew restless. It was not that he wished for\r\nit particularly, but when the \"Irreparables\" drank champagne with their\r\nsoup, sauterne with the meat, ate their nuts and made their toasts with\r\nsherry, his patience was put to a severe test. It was something to see\r\nthat most of the glasses went away almost untasted, but the head-teacher\r\nfound it best to keep a steady eye upon him and save him from doing more\r\nthan mutter his opinions.\r\n\r\nBut when the toasts came the gallery visibly brightened up. The\r\n\"Irreparables\" toasted the country and its resources, the United States,\r\nMrs. Seward, the Centennial, Mrs. Grant, and the widow the chief\r\nalderman was to marry. They drank to Queen Victoria, and, with a\r\nremembrance of past loyalty, to the czarina. To each toast a member\r\nresponded in terms fitting and witty, and when the pretty girl arose\r\nand, with a glance at the gallery, gave \"The gentlemen--God bless them!\"\r\nthe baroness stood up and made reply. She thanked the company in the\r\nname of the gentlemen. She spoke of them in high and eloquent terms. She\r\nalluded to their usefulness, their courage, their good looks. She did\r\nthem full justice as resources in times of trouble, of war and of\r\nmidnight burglaries.\r\n\r\nThe county clerk ran his fingers through his hair, the color came into\r\nthe cheeks of the clergyman, and a subdued murmur as of pleasure ran\r\nthrough the little group in the gallery.\r\n\r\nThen the baroness continued. She said she was not a woman-suffragist--at\r\nleast she wasn't sure that she was. She had, she thanked her stars, her\r\nown opinion upon most matters, but while she had no positive objection\r\nto right-minded women having any real or fancied wrongs redressed, and\r\nin their own way, she had not yet thought clearly enough upon the\r\nsubject to be sure that the ballot was the remedy. She knew there was a\r\ngreat deal of nonsense talked about the moral influence women would\r\nexert in politics: perhaps they would, but to her it seemed very much\r\nlike watering potato-blossoms to get rid of the worms at the root.\r\n\r\nHere the county clerk half rose, but the head-teacher held him with his\r\ndisciplining eye, and he sat down again.\r\n\r\nWhat was needed, said the baroness, was not mending, regenerating,\r\ngiving freedom or doing justice. These things were all very good, but\r\nmore was necessary. \"There is no remedy,\" she said with rising\r\ninflections and with emphasis--\"no remedy but a total change. What we\r\nwant is not an extension of the suffrage, but a _limitation_!\"\r\n\r\nShe wished it, however, distinctly understood that she in no way meant\r\nto affirm that woman was man's superior: she did not think so. In his\r\nown place man could not be surpassed. The sciences, the arts, the\r\nindustrial pursuits, religion, civilization, all owed a deep debt to\r\nman, and it could not be ignored. She was the last person in the world\r\nto wish to ignore it. Properly governed, disciplined and educated, his\r\ndevelopment might outrun hope, defy prophecy. Out of his place he was a\r\ncomet without an orbit. Drawn hither and thither by sinister stars, he\r\nwas an eccentricity beyond calculation and full of harm. For this reason\r\nthe interests of humanity demanded that the place of man in the conduct\r\nof affairs should be well defined and limited. It was well to look this\r\nmatter in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" proceeded the baroness, \"I leave it to any class of men, to any\r\none man, to declare whether the world is, or ever has been, well\r\ngoverned. Is there any age, any country upon record, where justice has\r\nreigned, where the interests of every class have been consulted, and\r\nwhere the people have lived together in mutual esteem, in unity and in\r\nprosperity? If we look through the world to-day, we find but one country\r\nthat is governed in anything like a satisfactory manner. It is loved by\r\nsome classes of its people, and admired by very many foreigners. When we\r\nreflect that it is governed by a queen, and that history tells us that\r\nits most prosperous period in the past was under Queen Elizabeth, it is\r\ncertainly safe to assume--No, no, my friends,\" she said, hastily, \"do\r\nnot applaud. That is not my point. It is possible that women may govern\r\nbetter than men, but that is yet to be tested. This illustration proves\r\nbut one thing--_that a country is better for not being governed by a\r\nman_.\"\r\n\r\nHer point was this: she did not appear as an advocate of suffrage for\r\nwomen, but as an earnest petitioner against its being any longer held by\r\nmen. The one thing a man could _not_ do was--to govern! This was no\r\nassertion. It was a fact proved by all history. Since the beginning of\r\nthe world men had had the governing power in their hands, and what a\r\nmess they had always made of it! There had never been a decent\r\ngovernment. Oppression, rebellion, anarchy, war, bloodshed, slavery and\r\ntyranny,--this was their record.\r\n\r\nIf women could do anything better, she was in favor of giving them the\r\nopportunity of proving it, but it was not her purpose to propose the\r\nafter-treatment. She was not a physician in charge, but the surgeon for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nShe had made suggestions: she freely confessed it. She had, for\r\ninstance, proposed to their talented townsman, the editor of the\r\n_Snow-Drift_, a series of articles upon the existing Presidential\r\ncontest. As far as she could learn, there was a great lack of unanimity\r\nregarding the vote, and it was not clear to the Hayes party that Tilden\r\nwas elected. Now, she had suggested that there were certain classes\r\nconcerned but _not_ consulted in the election, and to them she proposed\r\nleaving the decision. The legal voters had blundered horribly in some\r\nway, and she would have been in favor of allowing the Indians, the\r\nChinese, the convicts, the idiots _and_ the women to decide the matter.\r\nIt could not be made worse, and it might be made better.\r\n\r\nBut leaving all these questions of a past hour, she would put the axe\r\nwhere George Washington did not put it--at the root of the tree--near\r\nenough also, she would remark, to leave no stump, and so at once place\r\npolitics upon a new basis by taking the governing power away from the\r\ngentlemen, God bless them!\r\n\r\n  LOUISE STOCKTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland and America have long been classed among the unmusical countries\r\nof the world, and for good reasons. Their history so far records the\r\nnames of no composers of a high rank; and although in both countries\r\nthere are plenty of amateurs and minor musicians who fully appreciate\r\nthe best there is in the art, yet the people as a whole are not\r\ninfluenced by it in the same way as the Germans and the Italians, to\r\nwhose hungry souls music is as necessary as is oxygen to their lungs. If\r\nwe adopt the good old-fashioned classification of instrumental and vocal\r\npieces into \"music for the feet,\" or dance music, \"music for the ear,\"\r\nor drawing-room music, \"and music for the head and heart,\" or classical\r\nmusic, we are forced to admit that so far only the first of these\r\nclasses has found general favor with our masses. Waltzes, quick-steps,\r\ngalops, quadrilles, are the daily food of our people, and there are\r\nthousands of pianos scattered throughout the country which are never\r\nused for any other purpose than to play this dance music, which occupies\r\nabout the same place in relation to the higher forms of music as dancing\r\non the stage does to artistic acting. Next comes the somewhat more\r\nelevated branch of drawing-room or _salon_ music, which in the cities\r\nand towns is very largely cultivated. It is typified by the popular\r\n\"Maiden's Prayer,\" and also includes the more sensational of the French\r\nand Italian opera melodies with all their vocal pyrotechnics, as well as\r\nthe pianoforte fantasias on these same melodies--in short, all music\r\nwritten with a view to giving the performer an opportunity of displaying\r\nfacility of execution rather than genuine feeling.\r\n\r\nIt is only in our centres of culture, the largest of our cities, that\r\nsufficient interest is taken in the highest products of musical genius\r\nto call into life and to support respectable orchestras and choruses;\r\nand even in these centres of culture there is no excess of devotion, as\r\nis perhaps best shown by the great rarity of amateur string quartettes,\r\nthose most intellectual and most enjoyable of all musical clubs, whose\r\nsphere is classical chamber music, the direct opposite in most respects\r\nof the drawing-room music just spoken of. How different all this is\r\nfrom the state of affairs in Germany, where every town of ten thousand\r\ninhabitants has its well-managed opera-house and its various kinds of\r\nmusical clubs for public and private amusement! The difference may best\r\nbe realized by reading Wagner's admirable little essay, _Ueber Deutsches\r\nMusikwesen_, republished in the first volume of his collected works.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better way of arriving at a just estimate of the\r\npresent state of general musical culture in this country than by looking\r\nat what may be called the creative department, and examining the vocal\r\nand instrumental sheet-music of native composers continually issued in\r\nsuch large quantities by our publishers. Were we to follow an old maxim,\r\nthat the best way of judging the inner life of a nation is to listen to\r\nits music, and accordingly judge of the sentiments and emotions of\r\nAmericans by their sheet-music, we should arrive at very discouraging\r\nresults. The characteristics of our sheet-music, briefly summed up, are:\r\n(1) trite and vulgar melody, devoid of all originality, repeating what\r\nhas been heard a thousand times already; (2) equally trite and\r\nmonotonous accompaniments, the harmony limited to half a dozen\r\nelementary chords, the rhythm mechanical and commonplace, and the\r\ncadences unchanging as the laws of Nature; (3) insipid, sensational\r\ntitles; (4) words usually so silly that a respectable country newspaper\r\nwould refuse to print them in its columns--true to the French _bon-mot_,\r\nthat what is too stupid to be spoken or read must be sung.\r\n\r\nThis may seem too sweeping a condemnation, but it is not. There are some\r\nhonorable exceptions of course, but only just enough of them to attract\r\nnotice by the contrast, and thus to prove the rule. If an aspiring young\r\ncomposer wishes to appear in print, the point to which he must direct\r\nhis attention is to secure, not a good original melody or a piquant\r\naccompaniment, but a \"catching\" title, like \"Timber-Thief Galop,\"\r\n\"Silver Bill Polka,\" or \"Sitting Bull March.\" If his choice in this\r\nrespect does not please the publisher, his manuscript may yet escape the\r\npaper-basket if its title-page happens to be embellished with a\r\ngrotesque cartoon or a sentimental picture of a couple of lovers or cats\r\nwho have met by moonlight alone. From these external and all-essential\r\nattributes an experienced agent can form an accurate estimate of how\r\nlarge the sale of a new piece will be; and he will tell you that so\r\nlittle does the excellence of the music contribute to its success that\r\nin general the sale of compositions in this country stands in inverse\r\nratio to their merits.\r\n\r\nThe sheet-music nuisance seems to be a phenomenon peculiar to this\r\ncountry; for, although France, England, Italy, and even Germany,\r\nannually produce much music which is not worth the printer's ink, yet in\r\ncomparison with ours it might almost be called classical. And the\r\nmelancholy thing about it is, that specimens of these flimsy productions\r\nmay be seen lying about freely on the pianos of people who would blush\r\nat the mere thought of having books of the same intellectual and\r\naesthetic level lying on their parlor-tables for general inspection and\r\nfor the entertainment of guests. For, while the corrupting influence of\r\nan impure story or a bad picture has long since been recognized, it\r\nstill seems to be imagined by many educated people that music being the\r\n\"divine art\" any form of it must of course be desirable, and better than\r\nnothing at all. This is the form of Philistinism which before all others\r\nmust be combated ere we can hope to materially purify our musical\r\natmosphere. The error naturally arose from the great amount of silly\r\ntalk about music, which is usually represented as being incapable of\r\nlending itself to the expression of any but the noblest sentiments and\r\nemotions. Quite the contrary. If good music has all those wonderful\r\npowers which have been ascribed to it from time immemorial, it follows\r\nnecessarily that bad music must exert equal powers in an opposite\r\ndirection. In fact, bad music is even a more demoralizing agent than,\r\nfor instance, a miserable newspaper. The latter is once hastily read\r\nthrough and then thrown away, while a poor musical composition is apt to\r\nbe preserved in the parlor--perhaps, neatly bound with some others of\r\nlike value, is carefully studied, or even memorized, and repeatedly sung\r\nat evening parties; and in this way it cannot but slowly vitiate the\r\ntaste of performer and hearer alike, and make them deaf to the beauties\r\nof better things.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from this aspect of music in America to our concert-halls,\r\nthe prospect is much brighter. In this department we have achieved more\r\nthan in any other, and no one is now obliged to go abroad in order to\r\nhear a good concert, as he is if he wishes to enjoy a respectable\r\noperatic performance. How much of this is due to the energy of one man,\r\nMr. Theodore Thomas, everybody knows, and it is not too much to say that\r\nthe \"new departure\" he is about to make may be expected to mark an epoch\r\nin the history of American music. Cincinnati will henceforth claim the\r\nposition of musical metropolis, and whether its pre-eminence be conceded\r\nor a vigorous rivalry maintained, the whole country must feel the good\r\neffect of that generous ambition which has rescued a noble enterprise\r\nfrom an uncertain and fluctuating condition, and offered it a secure\r\nhaven.\r\n\r\nAmericans have already good reasons for being proud of their concerts,\r\nfor except in Berlin there are perhaps no audiences in Europe which have\r\nthe advantage of us in this respect. This can be seen by comparing our\r\nprogrammes with those offered in continental cities, as recorded every\r\nweek in the _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_, published at Leipsic. I have\r\nrepeatedly seen paragraphs in leading German papers calling attention to\r\nMr. Thomas's programmes, and hinting that their own conductors might\r\nlearn something from them. What is particularly noticeable about them is\r\ntheir cosmopolitanism, and this has contributed much to their success.\r\nIt has been said, however, by some that Thomas's sole aim seems to be to\r\noffer as many novelties as possible, and that he disregards artistic\r\nperspective in the arrangement of his programmes. He has indeed never\r\nfollowed the illiberal principle that it is bad taste to perform the\r\nworks of living masters--a principle which has done much to bring to the\r\nbrink of ruin a certain association in Boston--but he has endeavored to\r\ndo justice to all the composers from Bach to Berlioz and Wagner. If Mr.\r\nThomas makes an effort to introduce to his audience a new symphony by\r\nBrahms or a new symphonic poem by Saint Saeens immediately after its\r\nissue from the press, we certainly ought to be very grateful to him for\r\nhis enterprise. When a prominent author writes a new book everybody is\r\neager to get sight of it as soon as possible, and no one has any fault\r\nto find with this curiosity. But when a similar eagerness is manifested\r\nto hear a new symphony, the conservatives at once cry out, \"For shame!\r\nWould you neglect the old masters for the sake of pieces which the wear\r\nand tear of time have not yet proved to possess permanent value?\" The\r\nMessrs. Conservatives evidently do not perceive the ludicrous aspect of\r\ntheir position. If their influence were not fortunately losing instead\r\nof gaining in strength, we might soon look for the extinction of art\r\nthrough the infanticide of genius. Mr. Thomas is not a conservative,\r\nand, thanks to this fact, we are often enabled to hear a new composition\r\neven before it has been performed in all the German capitals.\r\n\r\nOf the condition of our operatic affairs it is impossible to speak in\r\nthe same terms of self-congratulation as of our concerts, and will\r\nremain impossible as long as our opera troupes differ in no essential\r\nrespects--except in being less sure of their parts--from travelling\r\nbands of negro minstrels. An orchestra may with impunity travel from one\r\ncity to another: it always remains the same, and only needs a good hall\r\nto appear to advantage. But an operatic performance is such a\r\ncomplicated affair that excellence can only be attained after years of\r\nconstant practice under the same conditions and with the same materials,\r\nand without constant changes in the chorus, orchestra and stage\r\nsurroundings. European experience seems to show that without government\r\nassistance good dramatic and operatic performances are not possible. In\r\nFrance and Germany, where such assistance is given, the theatres are\r\ngood: in England and America, where none is given, they are bad. Perhaps\r\nin course of time our national or city governments will come to\r\nrecognize and support the theatre as an educational institution, or at\r\nleast as a good means of suppressing intemperance and other vices by\r\nsupplying a harmless mode of amusement. There is little prospect,\r\nhowever, that this will happen soon. It is more likely that some of our\r\nrich men will at last come to see the folly of founding so many new\r\ncolleges, and devote their money to other uses. Had Mr. Samuel Wood left\r\nhis money for the establishment of a permanent first-class opera instead\r\nof a conservatory, he would have done a wiser thing. The importance of a\r\ngood opera-house as an institution for promoting musical culture is not\r\nyet generally understood--naturally enough, considering the wretched\r\nperformances we have so far been obliged to endure. The opera has one\r\ngreat advantage over concerts: it is more attractive to the uninitiated.\r\nIt appeals to the eye as well as the ear. The scenic splendors will\r\nattract many unmusical and semi-musical people who shun the purely\r\nintellectual atmosphere of a classical concert as a great bore; and\r\nwhile they gaze at the wonders of the scenery they unconsciously drink\r\nin the music, so that in course of time they learn to appreciate that\r\nfor its own sake. When _Lohengrin_ was first performed in the German\r\ncities the masses attended it chiefly to see the new and brilliant\r\nscenic effects. They found the music stupid, devoid of melody and form,\r\nand bristling with \"algebraic\" harmonies. But they went so often to see\r\nthe swan drawing the mysterious knight through the waters of the Rhine\r\nthat they finally learned that the opera is a rich storehouse of the\r\nmost exquisite melody, that a wonderful unity of forms pervades the\r\nwhole, and that the algebraic harmonies serve to express depths of\r\nemotion hitherto unknown. In the same way the Vienna people have been\r\nlately crowding the theatre to see the Rhine-daughters in their long\r\nblue robes swimming about under the surface of the river, to see the\r\nfight with the dragon, the march of the gods over the rainbow, the ride\r\nof the walkyries on their wild steeds, the burning Walhalla, etc., and\r\nhave gradually discovered that their critics at Bayreuth again hoaxed\r\nthem when they wrote that the music of the _Trilogy_ was \"atomic,\" that\r\nit was devoid of melody, and that the harmony was in defiance of all the\r\nlaws of euphony.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations show the value of good scenery. Independently of its\r\nartistic value, it is a legitimate bait for enticing people to a place\r\nwhere they are obliged to hear good music. Good scenery, however, has\r\nnever been the strong point of our opera troupes. They never had more\r\nthan one strong point. Formerly, some of the great _prime donne_ used to\r\npay us an occasional visit, but now even they have learned to avoid us,\r\nbecause we are no longer willing to pay five dollars for an evening's\r\namusement. London, Paris and St. Petersburg are at present the\r\nhead-quarters of the costly \"stars.\" Nor is this fact to be regretted.\r\nThe decline of the star system is rather to be greeted as the dawn of a\r\nbetter era. It has always been the curse of the opera and the greatest\r\nobstacle to improvement. There was a time when the prima donna was so\r\nomnipotent that even the composers were her slaves, being frequently\r\nobliged to alter passages to suit the taste of the stage goddess; and\r\nthere are instances on record of whole operas having been composed in\r\nvain because she did not happen to be pleased with them, and refused to\r\nsing. This evil period we have happily out-grown, but an equally great\r\nnuisance remains. The exorbitant prices still demanded by the \"stars\"\r\nare out of all proportion to their deserts, and show that even if the\r\ncomposers are their slaves no longer, the spectators and managers still\r\nare so. In Paris and elsewhere it is often found impossible to do\r\njustice to the secondary stage appointments because the salaries of the\r\nsoprano and the tenor swallow the whole income. The Germans, on the\r\nother hand, are too artistic and rational to endure such an imposition.\r\nTo them the one-star-and-ten-satellites system seems an abomination, and\r\ndoubtless Emperor William had the sympathies and approval of all his\r\nsubjects when he refused to engage Patti at a price that would have\r\nproved disastrous to the high aims of the imperial opera, which are to\r\npreserve an evenly-balanced and uniform excellence of all the parts of a\r\nperformance. There are signs that even England is outgrowing the star\r\nsystem. Carl Rosa has adopted the German system of dispensing with\r\n\"phenomenal\" singers, putting the minor roles into good hands, and\r\nkeeping a well-trained chorus and orchestra; and his success, as\r\neverybody knows, has been enormous. Now let some competent manager in\r\nthis country follow his example: let him show that he does not merely\r\naim at getting the people's money, but that he has also the ambition of\r\nhonestly interpreting the works of the masters and developing a healthy\r\ntaste for good dramatic music and acting, and there can be little doubt\r\nthat instead of increasing the number of failures now recorded, the\r\nenterprise would prove a success, and show, as Carl Rosa's has done,\r\nthat in this way opera can be made to pay even without government\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAlthough our rulers have not yet recognized the theatre as a possible\r\nsource of culture, they have done something which to the country at\r\nlarge is of even greater importance than this would be. They have been\r\ngradually introducing vocal music as a regular branch of study in our\r\npublic schools. In this matter we seem to have anticipated England, for\r\nwhile singing was introduced in the schools of Boston more than forty,\r\nand in Baltimore more than thirty, years ago, in the British House of\r\nCommons only twenty-five years ago, when a member proposed that singing\r\nshould be taught in all schools, as in Germany, \"the suggestion was\r\nreceived with ridicule, and was deemed deserving of no other response\r\nthan a loud laugh.\" But there has also been, and still is, some\r\nopposition to its general introduction in this country. Only a few\r\nmonths ago the St. Louis press urged its removal from the schools on the\r\nground that it is one of the \"ornamental\" studies, and that more time is\r\nin that city, for instance, devoted to it than to the practical subjects\r\nof geography and arithmetic. This last objection has not much force. All\r\nthat is really practical and generally useful in geography and\r\narithmetic can be learned in a few years, whereas to make progress in\r\nthe difficult art of music it is necessary to begin early and continue\r\nfor many years. The true answer to such an objection is, that there is\r\nno need of neglecting either of these branches. There is time enough for\r\nall of them if only a proper method of instruction be pursued. Still\r\nmore untenable is the idea that music is merely an ornamental study and\r\nof no practical value. This idea rests on the mistaken theory of\r\neducation which holds that only the intellect needs training. If our\r\nsole aim is to get something to eat and to drink, and a house to shelter\r\nus from the weather, then we need only cultivate the intellect so that\r\nwe may be able to compete with others. But if we care for beautiful\r\nhomes, if we wish to enjoy life in a higher sense than that in which a\r\nsavage enjoys it, and to make ourselves and others happy, then the\r\ntraining of the emotions through music is as important as the training\r\nof the intellect in a practical and not an \"ornamental\" sense.\r\n\r\nFortunately, none of the objections hitherto urged against singing in\r\npublic schools have been able to effect any change for the worse. Vocal\r\nmusic is now taught in the common schools of nearly every city and large\r\ntown in New England and the Northern and Western States. In\r\nBoston--which has always been noted for its excellence in this\r\ndepartment--thanks to the intelligent labors of Mr. Lowell Mason and Mr.\r\nJulius Eichberg, it is now possible, on occasion, to raise a chorus of\r\nfive thousand well-trained juvenile voices. And it is gratifying to\r\nobserve with what unanimity the good influence of public-school singing\r\nis attested by the commissioners of all those States which have given it\r\na fair trial. The grounds on which it is usually commended are that it\r\nputs life and variety into the dull routine of studies--that it promotes\r\norder and discipline, stimulates the social feelings, electrifies the\r\nwearied nervous system, conduces to health by the regular and vigorous\r\nexercise of the lungs, trains the moral sentiments by refining the\r\naesthetic emotions, and tends to improve the congregational singing in\r\nour churches. To quote the language of the Commissioner of Education\r\n(_Report for 1873_): \"Experience proves that as music is perfected and\r\nused in the daily routine of school duties, just in that proportion are\r\nthe deportment and general appearance of the schools improved.\" Indeed,\r\nit is difficult to calculate all the good results that in course of time\r\nmust follow from general musical instruction in our schools. It is\r\ncertainly the only effective method of removing in a few generations the\r\nreproach that we are not a musical people. In Germany--which perhaps has\r\ndone more for music than all other countries combined--the foundation\r\nfor musical culture is laid in the schools by the singing of folk-songs\r\n(_Volkslieder_) and chorals in three-or four-part harmony. And those who\r\nhave read the history of music know that these same folk-songs and\r\nchorals were the first musical fruits grown on German soil: they were\r\nthe fruits on which in past centuries the people lived and formed their\r\ntaste. It is evident, therefore, that in now teaching these folk-songs\r\nand chorals to their children the Germans are guided by that important\r\nlaw of evolution which shows that the development of the child partly\r\ndoes, and partly should be made to, conform to the development of the\r\nrace, step by step.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why we should not follow this same principle. Of\r\ncourse it will not be necessary to confine ourselves to German\r\nfolk-songs, although these are on the whole the best. We are a mixed\r\npeople, compounded of all nationalities, and hence the folk-songs of\r\nItaly, France, Scotland, Russia and various other countries should all\r\nbe acclimated in our schools. There is something peculiarly healthy and\r\nfresh about folk-songs which one only finds again in the very highest\r\nefforts of individual creative genius. They are like flowers that have\r\ngrown up in virgin forests, nurtured by rain and sunshine, fanned by\r\nvigorous breezes and shielded from all the hot-house influences of a\r\nmorbid civilization. So rich and spontaneous are many of these melodies\r\nthat they can be thoroughly enjoyed even when sung without harmony or\r\naccompaniment, while for advanced classes it is easy to write second and\r\nthird vocal parts, thus adding to their interest and value.\r\n\r\nWhile early familiarity with the best of these songs would have a good\r\neffect in refining the popular sense of melody, the appreciation of what\r\ncame last and is highest in music--of harmonic progressions--could best\r\nbe taught by a similar familiarity with the German four-part chorals.\r\nThey are the very embodiment of vigorous, soul-stirring harmony, the\r\nbasis of sacred, as the _Volkslied_ is of secular, music. \"Each of our\r\nchurches,\" says Thibaut, the author of the celebrated little book on\r\n_Purity in Musical Art_, \"had a period of the highest enthusiasm, which\r\nwill never return, and each of them has at this very period of the most\r\nardent religious zeal done its utmost for the development of its song.\"\r\nThe German choral is the result of the intense devotional feelings which\r\nexisted among the early Protestant congregations, and it is evident that\r\na wholesome religious spirit could with it be introduced in our schools\r\nin a manner which could be objectionable to no denomination. In course\r\nof time these chorals might then be transferred to our churches, where\r\nthey might well take the place of the easier but very eccentric melodies\r\nand incorrect harmonies now too often heard there.\r\n\r\n  HENRY T. FINCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nA SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the side streets of a city which fronts on Long Island Sound\r\nis to be found a curiosity-shop whose show-window challenges the\r\nattention of all lovers of the quaint and queer by its jumble of cracked\r\nand ancient porcelain, old-fashioned brasses and small articles of more\r\nor less valuable bric-a-brac. Inside, the three small rooms are crowded\r\nwith sets of delft and willow china, old candlesticks, clocks, andirons,\r\nfenders, high-backed chairs and the like. The whole aspect of the place\r\nis shabby and dingy, and the antique furniture has no chance of showing\r\neither its worth or its dignity amid such surroundings; yet the traffic\r\nwhich goes on in this \"curiosity-shop\" has already brought a respectable\r\nfortune to the owner, and promises, if the rage for revivals of ancient\r\nfashions continues, to make him a capitalist. Knapp, as we will call\r\nthis dealer in second-hand furniture and bric-a-brac, began his trade\r\nsome five or six years ago. He was originally a tin-peddler, travelling\r\nup and down the country with his wagon, offering tin and glass ware in\r\nreturn for rags, feathers and old metals. Knapp probably had, to start\r\nwith, a touch of that original genius which transmutes the most ordinary\r\nconditions of life into means of personal aggrandizement. He laid the\r\nstepping-stone to his fortune when it one day occurred to him to accept\r\na piece of old-fashioned Wedgwood ware in return for half a dozen\r\nshining tins. It was an inspiration which he considered half a weakness,\r\nbut he yielded to it, and afterward had cause to congratulate himself\r\nwhen he found an opportunity for disposing of the cup at a remunerative\r\nrate. This gave him an impulse of curiosity toward any heirlooms in the\r\nway of china and pottery to be found among the farmers' wives in the\r\nsection of New England he traversed; and his activities soon had their\r\nreward. At that date the passion for ceramics was but just beginning to\r\ninvade our cities, and not a suspicion of it stirred the minds of the\r\ngood women who artlessly opened their cupboards and displayed their\r\ntreasures of Worcester china and willow-ware to the ingratiating Knapp.\r\nNo man in the world was ever better calculated to drive good bargains\r\nfor himself, yet leave an impression on his victim's mind that the\r\npeddler's interest in a \"sort of china which matched a set his\r\ngrandmother used to have\" was running away with his better judgment.\r\n\r\nKnapp became shortly a most interesting personage to people who were\r\nmaking collections, and he attained, besides ingenuity, genuine taste\r\nand skill in detecting marks and discerning values. In a year he had as\r\nnice a knowledge of china and pottery as any one in the country, and if\r\nthe farmers' wives were so much the poorer by the loss of what had been\r\nin the family for generations, they did not recognize their loss.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was by old clocks and brass andirons and fenders that Knapp\r\nmade his fortune. A gentleman asked him to procure him some\r\nold-fashioned articles of this sort, and the peddler at once went into\r\nthe matter on speculation, and bought up all the old brasses he could\r\nfind within a radius of fifty miles. These fenders and andirons were\r\ngladly parted with, growing rusty as they had been for years, and almost\r\nforgotten in garrets and cellars. New England farmers remember too\r\ndistinctly the shiverings and burnings of their youth not to feel an\r\ninsurmountable prejudice against open fires. So Knapp, whose wider\r\nknowledge made him master of the fact that this present generation,\r\nsickened of stoves and dreary black holes in the wall and burnt dead\r\nheat, and longing for some cheerful household centre, were restoring the\r\nold fireplaces and open fires, where the flames could leap and roar,\r\nand the logs burn and glow and smoulder,--Knapp, I say, humored this\r\nfancy by opening his shop and offering his old-fashioned fenders and\r\nandirons to the public. He had bought them at a mere song, and sold them\r\nagain at a price so reasonable that any purchaser might be suited, yet\r\nstill at a profit of five hundred to a thousand per cent.\r\n\r\nOnce started as a regular dealer, he went steadily on: his activity was\r\nincessant, and always productive. His energies seemed to have been\r\nshaped by an unerring and divining instinct. He found old sideboards,\r\nchests, wardrobes, brought from England two centuries ago, dropping to\r\npieces in barns and cellars. He found an \"almost priceless Elizabethan\r\ncabinet\" serving as a hen-house in a farmer's barnyard, and another in a\r\nlittle better condition used as a receptacle for pies in his cellar. He\r\nbought them both for five dollars, had them \"restored,\" and sold one for\r\neight hundred and the other for five hundred dollars. It is true that\r\nthis process of \"restoration\" was an expensive one, and in his next\r\nventure of the sort he demanded higher prices without offering articles\r\nso valuable or so unique. At present he is engaged in refurnishing a\r\nNorth River mansion of colonial times with suitable furniture and\r\ndecorations, and will be handsomely rewarded for his pains. But he is\r\ntoo well known now to find rare and curious articles as freely parted\r\nwith as they were a few years ago. Still, the hard times help him. Then,\r\ntoo, in New England old families are constantly passing away, and\r\nleaving what small possessions belonged to the last surviving maiden of\r\nthe race to far-away relations. These possessions, consisting of good\r\nsolid old furniture, are certain to become Knapp's if he finds anything\r\ndesirable among them. He has been known to go to a house within twelve\r\nhours of the death of the last surviving member of the family, and offer\r\nto negotiate with a servant or friend of the deceased for a chair,\r\ntable, clock or sideboard he coveted. I doubt if an auction of old\r\nfurniture has occurred for four years within one hundred miles of him\r\nwhere he has not been the first and the most privileged buyer.\r\n\r\n  L.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL-WAISTED WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the truth be fairly stated, women have many excuses for their\r\ninfatuation regarding small waists. It is Mrs. Haweis who says, \"The\r\nreason why a small waist is a beauty is because, when it is natural, it\r\ngoes together with the peculiar litheness and activity of a\r\nslenderly-built figure. All the bones are small, the shoulders and arms\r\n_petite_, and the general look is dainty and youthful.\" In other words,\r\na small waist is only a beauty when it is in proportion to the rest of\r\nthe figure. The common mistake lies in considering it a beauty in a\r\nlarge woman of massive proportions. A few centuries ago women did not\r\ntake a scientific view of things, and fell into delusions which in this\r\nage are a disgrace to the sex. They knew nothing of anatomy, of the law\r\nof proportion or of the curve of beauty, and they misunderstood the\r\nlanguage of admiration. The latter I suspect to be at the root of the\r\nwhole matter. Poets were, as we shall presently see, everlastingly\r\npraising small waists, and women fell into the error of supposing that a\r\nsmall waist was, in the abstract, a beauty and an attraction. When or\r\nwhere the mistake originated I cannot tell, but here are the words of\r\npraise of probably a fourteenth-century lover: \"Middel heo hath menskful\r\nsmal,\" or, \"She hath a graceful small waist.\" At a later day Master\r\nWither included in the attractions of her who had left him,\r\n\r\n          Her wast exceeding small,\r\n            The fives did fit her shoo;\r\n          But now, alasse! sh'as left me.\r\n\r\nThis suits exactly the modern view of a small waist and a No. 5 shoe.\r\n\r\nIn the well-known Scotch ballad \"Edom o' Gordon\" the Lady Rodes is\r\nrepresented as being shut up by Gordon in her burning castle. The smoke\r\nwas suffocating when,\r\n\r\n          Oh than bespaik her dochter dear:\r\n          She was baith jimp and sma', etc.\r\n\r\nHere it might be said that the evident youth of the girl, who was\r\ndropped over the wall and fell on the point of the cruel Gordon's spear,\r\naccounts for her being \"jimp and sma'.\" The explanation will not apply\r\nto \"The Cruel Sister,\" as given by Sir Walter Scott:\r\n\r\n          She took her by the middle sma',\r\n            Binnorie, O Binnorie!\r\n\r\nSo fascinated was the rhymer by that special feature of her beauty that\r\nhe returns to it after recounting how the elder sister drowned the\r\nyounger:\r\n\r\n          You could not see her middle sma',\r\n            Binnorie, O Binnorie!\r\n          Her gouden girdle was so bra,\r\n            By the bonny milldams of Binnorie.\r\n\r\nAnother instance is in the opening verse of Sir Walter Scott's version\r\nof \"The Lass of Lochroyan:\"\r\n\r\n          Oh wha will shoe my bonny foot?\r\n            And wha will glove my hand?\r\n          And wha will lace my middle jimp\r\n            Wi' a lang, lang linen band?\r\n\r\nThe last line appears to indicate the use of a linen band, as the Roman\r\nladies used the _strophium_, a broad ribbon tied round the breast as a\r\nsupport. From this it may be inferred that the \"Lass of Lochroyan\" did\r\nnot owe her \"middle jimp\" to any very deadly artificial means of\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable instances that can be adduced is in the\r\noriginal version of \"Annie Laurie,\" by William Douglas, a Scottish poet\r\nof the seventeenth century. It has been so completely displaced by a\r\nlater version that few are probably acquainted with the song as written\r\nby Douglas:\r\n\r\n          She's backit like a peacock,\r\n            She's breisted like a swan,\r\n          She's jimp about the middle,\r\n            Her waist ye weel micht span;\r\n          Her waist ye weel micht span,\r\n            And she has a rolling ee, etc.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these passages is there any wonder that it is hard to\r\npersuade women that men do not admire \"wasp\" waists? How are they to\r\nknow that the \"jimp middle\" of the ballads was in its jimpness in\r\nproportion to the shoulders? The trouble is, that the early rhymesters\r\nhave used up the only side of the question capable of poetical\r\ntreatment. One cannot sing of the reverse: no poet could seriously lift\r\nup his voice in praise of her \"ample waist\" or \"graceful portliness.\" In\r\norder to reach woman's ear, modern writers must adopt a different\r\ncourse, and it is curious to contrast their utterances with those of the\r\nballad-makers. Place Charles Reade by the side of Douglas, and then what\r\nbecomes of the \"waist ye weel micht span\"? After showing how the liver,\r\nlungs, heart, stomach and spleen are packed by Nature, the novelist\r\nasks: \"Is it a small thing for the creature (who uses a corset) to say\r\nto her Creator, 'I can pack all this egg-china better than you can,' and\r\nthereupon to jam all those vital organs close by a powerful, a very\r\npowerful, and ingenious machine?\"\r\n\r\nEvery lady should read _A Simpleton_, and learn something of the\r\nmonstrous wrong she inflicts upon herself by trying to compass an\r\nartificially-produced \"middle sae jimp.\" It will prepare her for Mrs.\r\nHaweis's lessons upon _The Art of Beauty_. One or two passages will give\r\na hint of their flavor: \"Nothing is so ugly as a pinched waist: it puts\r\nthe hips and shoulders invariably out of proportion in width.... In\r\ndeforming the waist almost all the vital organs are affected by the\r\npressure, and the ribs are pushed out of their proper place.\"\r\n\"Tight-lacing is ugly, because it distorts the natural lines of the\r\nfigure, and gives an appearance of uncertainty and unsafeness.... Men\r\nseldom take to wife a girl who has too small a waist, whether natural or\r\nartificial.\" \"In architecture, a pillar or support of any kind is called\r\ndebased and bad in art if what is supported be too heavy for the thing\r\nsupporting, and if a base be abnormally heavy and large for what it\r\nupholds. The laws of proportion and balance must be understood. In a\r\nwaist of fifteen inches both are destroyed, and the corresponding effect\r\nis unpleasant to the eye. The curve of the waist is coarse and\r\nimmoderate, utterly opposed to what Ruskin has shown to be beauty in a\r\ncurve. Real or artificial, such a waist is always ugly: if real, it is a\r\ndeformity that should be disguised; if artificial, it is culpable, and\r\nnasty to boot.\"\r\n\r\nNo rhyming can withstand such reasoning. If the ballads really had any\r\neffect in fostering an admiration of abnormally small waists, both\r\nscience and a truer conception of beauty should by this time have\r\ncounteracted their influence. Women cannot much longer, with decency,\r\nplead ignorance of the results of a practice which would be ridiculous\r\nwere it less pernicious.\r\n\r\n  J.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTOR HUGO AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the steep heights of the Rue de Clichy, at the corner of a street, we\r\nfind the number 21. How many heads crowned either with a laurel or a\r\ndiadem have passed beneath the arch of this doorway since Victor Hugo\r\nleft the Rue Pigalle to take up his abode here! The apartment inhabited\r\nby the poet can hardly be considered either spacious or elegant. Its\r\ndining-room is of cramped dimensions, and the famous red drawing-room,\r\nthough handsomely furnished, lacks the air of individuality that one\r\nwould naturally expect to find in it. Probably this arises from the\r\nwandering life that Victor Hugo has led for so many years. After the\r\n_coup d'etat_ the furniture of his house in the Rue de la Tour\r\nd'Auvergne was sold at auction. Contrary to custom, and probably through\r\nthe interference of some member of the imperial party, no police were at\r\nhand to protect or watch over the articles exposed for sale.\r\nConsequently, the depredations were frightful. Small objects were\r\ncarried off bodily, tapestries were cut to pieces and the furniture and\r\nstatues were mercilessly mutilated. One well-dressed man walked off with\r\nColumbus's compass--that which the insurrectionists had a few months\r\nbefore examined so respectfully, their leader remarking, \"That compass\r\ndiscovered America.\" Many of the poet's household treasures remain at\r\nHauteville House, in the island of Guernsey.\r\n\r\nBut the curiosity of the abode is the study. From floor to ceiling it is\r\none mass of books, letters, newspapers and manuscripts: the chairs, the\r\nmantelpiece, the table have disappeared beneath their burdens. A narrow\r\npath, shaped in the midst of these accumulations, permits the poet to\r\npass from the door to the window, Victor Hugo's correspondence is\r\nenormous, and is continually increasing. He receives letters from all\r\nsorts of people on all sorts of subjects--letters of homage and letters\r\nof abuse, requests for autographs and demands for money, verses sent by\r\nyouthful poets with prayers for his advice, and the wails of the\r\noppressed who look to him as their sworn champion. Very seldom does\r\nVictor Hugo refuse to answer, though his responses are necessarily\r\nbrief. Among these accumulated papers must be cited the vast mass of\r\nVictor Hugo's unpublished works. He never fails to devote a certain\r\nportion of the day to literary work, his brain being as clear, his\r\nimagination as fertile, his pen as ready, as they were twenty-five years\r\nago. \"Nulla dies sine linea\" is the motto of his daily life. Yet with\r\nall his industry he has been heard to lament that he will not live long\r\nenough to transfer to paper all the conceptions that crowd his busy\r\nbrain. In January, 1876, he remarked to a friend, \"Were I to begin\r\ngiving to the world my unpublished and completed works, I could issue a\r\nnew volume monthly for a year.\" Among these treasures for posterity are\r\nto be found the tragedies of _Torquemada_ and the _Twins_ (the Iron\r\nMask); the comedies of the _Grandmother_, _The Sword_, and perchance\r\n_The Brother of Gavroche_; a fairy piece wherein the flowers and trees\r\nplay speaking parts; volumes of poems entitled _The Four Winds of the\r\nMind_, _All the Lyre_, _Just Indignation_, _The Sinister Years_ (a\r\nconnecting link between _Les Chatiments_ and a _Terrible Year_); and\r\neven a scientific work on the effects of the sphere. He once said, \"I\r\nhave more to do than I have yet done. It seems to me that as I advance\r\nin years my horizon grows larger, so I shall depart and leave my work\r\nunfinished. It would take several more lifetimes to write down all that\r\nfills my brain. I shall never complete my task, but I am resigned: I see\r\nin my future more than I behold in my past.\"\r\n\r\nHe was once speaking of the denouement of _Marion Delorme_, and remarked\r\nthat he had written two last scenes for that tragedy, the first sombre\r\nand terrible, the second tender and touching, and that he had preferred\r\nthe former, but had yielded to the counsels of his friends and the\r\nactors in the piece, and had suffered it to be produced with the more\r\ngentle denouement. On being asked if he had destroyed the rejected\r\nscene, he made answer that he preserved everything he had ever written.\r\n\"Posterity can destroy what it pleases, and keep what it pleases,\" he\r\nadded with a smile.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo's receptions are delightfully simple and informal. He is at\r\nhome one evening in the week, when his friends and admirers gather round\r\nhim. No change of toilette is needed: the ladies appear in walking\r\ncostume, the gentlemen in frock-coats. \"The Master,\" as his intimate\r\nfriends and disciples love to call him, avoids all airs and posing with\r\nthe quiet simplicity of true genius. He does not plant himself in the\r\nmidst of his company, neither does he assume the consequential manners\r\nof a dictator. Seated in an arm-chair or on a sofa beside some favored\r\nguest, he converses--he does not discourse. At an early hour, in view of\r\nthe age and the simple habits of the host, the company separate, the\r\nmost enthusiastic raising the hand of the Master to their lips as they\r\ntake leave. One of the greatest charms about Victor Hugo's manner is\r\nthat he never shrinks from or repels any manifestation of genuine\r\nadmiration or homage. Unlike celebrities of far less note, who profess\r\nto be indignant or disgusted at any such manifestations, he lends\r\nhimself to what must often be wearisome to him with a kindly\r\ngraciousness that often changes the enthusiasm of his admirers into a\r\npassionate personal attachment.\r\n\r\nFew men have ever enjoyed so wide-spread and enduring a popularity as\r\ndoes Victor Hugo among the people of Paris. When, during the dark days\r\nof 1870, he returned from his long exile, he was greeted at the\r\nrailway-station by a vast crowd, which escorted his carriage to his\r\nfirst resting-place, the home of M. Paul Meurice, and he was twice\r\ncompelled to address a few words to them in order to appease their\r\neagerness to hear his voice. When he appears in public on great and\r\nsolemn occasions, such as the funeral of M. Thiers, he is invariably\r\nmade the object of a popular ovation of the most touching character.\r\nPeople climb up the sides of his carriage to touch his hand, mothers\r\nlift up their children to the windows imploring his blessing, and the\r\ncry of \"Vive Victor Hugo!\" goes up from the very hearts of the throng.\r\nOn the day of the funeral of Madame Paul Meurice, as the cortege was\r\ngoing along the exterior boulevards, it passed near a menagerie. Just as\r\nthe carriage of Victor Hugo came opposite the door the lions within set\r\nup a tremendous roar. \"They know that the _other one_ is passing by,\"\r\nsaid an old workingman beside the carriage (\"Ils sentent que l'autre\r\npasse\"). The fondness of Victor Hugo for riding about Paris on the top\r\nof an omnibus is well known. It has sometimes happened that on tendering\r\nhis fare the conductor has put the coin aside with the remark, \"I shall\r\nkeep that as a relic.\" One day, on returning from a session of the\r\nsenate at Versailles, he arrived late at the station. It was a snowy\r\nday, the train was full, and he was obliged to climb into a fourth-class\r\nplace, a seat on the top of the cars. The benches were covered with\r\nsnow. A workingman who recognized the poet would not let him sit down\r\ntill with his blouse he had wiped the seat clean and dry. Victor Hugo\r\nthanked him and offered him his hand, and with a naive delight the good\r\nfellow cried, \"Ah, monsieur, ah, citizen, how proud I am to have seen\r\nyou and touched you!\" More than once the cabman employed to take the\r\npoet to his house has refused to accept his fare, declaring that the\r\nhonor of having driven Victor Hugo was recompense enough. On the day of\r\nthe funeral of M. Thiers so dense a crowd surrounded the carriage of the\r\npoet that it remained for a long time motionless and imprisoned, and the\r\nshouts that greeted him were so wildly enthusiastic that the coachman\r\nwho was driving his carriage fairly shed tears, remarking, however, in a\r\nshame-faced manner, \"A crying coachman! what a silly sight!\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, beside this passionate love stands a hate as passionate. The\r\nvindictive fury of the Bonapartists against Victor Hugo can easily be\r\nunderstood. No writer more than he has contributed to render a\r\nrestoration of the Empire impossible. Hence insults of all kinds, from\r\nthe calumny openly printed in an imperialist newspaper to the anonymous\r\nletter overflowing with menaces. One of these, received in September,\r\n1877, threatened the poet in no doubtful terms. \"Do not imagine,\r\nscoundrel, that we will let you escape us a second time:\" so ran one of\r\nits paragraphs. Under the Second Empire all letters written to or by\r\nVictor Hugo were compelled to pass through the ordeal of the Black\r\nCabinet. Many of his Parisian correspondents evaded this surveillance by\r\nsending their letters under cover to acquaintances in Germany or by\r\nconfiding them to travellers who were going to England. But the letters\r\nof the poet to his friends in France were invariably opened and read,\r\nand many of them were confiscated. In a sarcastic mood Victor Hugo\r\ncaused a quantity of envelopes to be prepared for his use, in one corner\r\nof which was printed an extract from the law forbidding any agent of the\r\ngovernment to open or to tamper with any letter that passes through the\r\npost-office. On one occasion he wrote across the address of a letter,\r\n\"Family matters--useless to open it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that the empress Eugenie, after perusing _Les Chatiments_,\r\nthrew the volume aside with this exclamation: \"I do not see what harm we\r\nhave ever done to this M. Hugo.\" This remark was afterward repeated to\r\nthe poet. \"Tell her that the harm was the second of December,\" was his\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThe bottle that contained the ink used in writing _Napoleon le Petit_\r\nhad a curious history. That splendid and fiery piece of invective, so\r\namply justified by after events, was commenced on the 12th of June,\r\n1852, and finished on the 14th of July, the anniversary of the taking of\r\nthe Bastile. With the few drops of ink that remained in the bottle\r\nVictor Hugo wrote upon its label--\r\n\r\n          Out of this bottle\r\n          Came _Napoleon the Little_,\r\n\r\nand affixed his signature. The bottle was given by Victor Hugo to Madame\r\nDrouet, who afterward presented it to a young physician who had attended\r\nher through a dangerous illness. This young physician, Dr. Yvan, owed to\r\nthe intercession of Prince Jerome Napoleon permission to return to\r\nFrance to visit his dying father. Having invited the prince to dinner\r\nafter his return, he showed him as a curiosity the famous bottle. No\r\nsooner had the prince read the inscription than he insisted upon taking\r\npossession of it, and in spite of the remonstrances of Dr. Yvan he\r\ncarried it off in triumph.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo is very hospitable, and delights in having three or four\r\nfriends to dine with him, but his appetite, though healthful, is neither\r\nvery great nor very dainty: he prefers plain food and drinks only light\r\nclaret habitually. He is a very early riser, and on fine spring or\r\nsummer mornings he may often be met at six o'clock taking a stroll in\r\nthe Champs Elysees. Of his fondness for riding on the tops of omnibuses\r\nI have already spoken. These long rides, when he traverses Paris from\r\none end to the other, are his periods of composition. He sits plunged in\r\na profound reverie, with vague eyes gazing unseeing into space. So well\r\nare his moods understood by the conductors and habitual travellers on\r\nthose lines that he is always left undisturbed. Sometimes the greater\r\npart of the day will be passed in these excursions, nor does any\r\nseverity of the weather ever daunt the aged poet. Yet with all the quiet\r\nsimplicity of his habits his daily life has not escaped the shafts of\r\ncalumny. The Bonapartist press declared that he was a drunkard who used\r\noften to be picked up insensible from the floor of his own dining-room.\r\nHe has been called an assassin because of his sympathy with the\r\nproscribed Communists, a madman because of his enthusiastic and\r\nimpassioned utterances, and he has been said to be a hunchback whose\r\ndeformity was dissimulated by the skill of his tailor.\r\n\r\nAny sketch of the poet's home-life would be incomplete did I not touch\r\non his passionate fondness for his grand-children, the two little beings\r\nwhose prattle and caresses lend a charm of peculiar sweetness to the\r\nwaning hours of that illustrious career. For them the world-renowned\r\ngenius is but the most loving and tender of grandfathers. Their games,\r\ntheir studies, their baby caprices, sway the actions of that grand\r\npersonality as the zephyrs ruffle the surface of the summer ocean. The\r\ncreator of _Marion Delorme_ excels in manoeuvring a puppet-show and in\r\ngetting up plays on a dolls' theatre. The author of _Les Miserables_\r\noften lulls these little ones to sleep with improvised tales of\r\nwonderful fascination. For their sakes he becomes a sculptor and moulds\r\nin bread-crumb most marvellous pigs with four matches for legs. They it\r\nis who know best the almost feminine tenderness, the wellnigh maternal\r\nlove, of which that powerful nature is capable.\r\n\r\nI write in the present tense, yet as I write these things exist no\r\nlonger. The red drawing-room is closed, the dwelling on the Rue de\r\nClichy is deserted. Victor Hugo is in Guernsey, and from that far\r\nretreat come sinister rumors respecting his failing health. These are\r\ndenied by his friends, but are stoutly supported by his enemies. Which\r\nof them speak the truth? That is hard to tell. It may be that this grand\r\ncareer, long and lustrous as a summer day, has reached its evening hour\r\nat last. Perchance we shall see no more the massive head framed in its\r\nsnow-white locks and beard, the piercing eyes, the stalwart frame that\r\nbore so lightly the burden of wellnigh fourscore years. It may be so,\r\nand yet we hope, we pray, for the return of him who lights our century\r\nwith the lustre of the great creative genius of the world.\r\n\r\n  L.H.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITS IN SCANDINAVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally known that there have been of late great and\r\npeculiar changes in the laws which regulate the sale of intoxicating\r\ndrinks in the Scandinavian peninsula, there is not among foreigners an\r\naccurate idea of these changes. It may not therefore be uninteresting\r\nto state them a little in detail, as well as to glance at the results as\r\ngathered from personal experience and observation in different parts of\r\nSweden and Norway. It should be premised that the peculiar \"vanity\" of\r\nboth the Swedes and the Norwegians is spirits, and that the recent\r\nlicensing laws in Scandinavia have been largely levelled against the\r\nsale of these drinks. For about a century prior to 1854, Sweden was so\r\ngiven to drunkenness that one who has had special opportunities of\r\njudging described it as \"the most drunken country in the world.\" Free\r\ntrade in spirits was practically in force: every small land-owner could\r\ndistil on payment of a nominal license fee, and in towns every burgher\r\nhad the right of sale. The whole country may be said \"to have been\r\ndeluged with spirits;\" but, profiting by the exertions of the apostles\r\nof temperance, a public opinion was created which twenty-four years ago\r\nproduced a bill on which the existing _general_ law is based. It\r\nabolished the small stills and imposed a comparatively heavy duty on the\r\npopular drink, _branvin_. It established a sort of threefold control\r\nover the issue of new licenses for the sale of spirits, under which the\r\ncommunal committee, the commune and the governor of a province have\r\npower to restrict or lessen the number of such licenses, while each\r\nseller of spirits was required to pay to the local rates a tax on the\r\namount of spirits sold. The licenses were issued for periods of three\r\nyears, and sold by auction to the highest bidders. To such an extent has\r\nthe sale of spirits been swept under this law from the rural parts of\r\nSweden that in 1871 there were only four hundred and sixty places for\r\nthe sale of spirits in the country, the towns excepted. From observation\r\nand from the report of others the writer is able to say that the effect\r\nof this has been most beneficial in the rural parts, materially\r\ncontributing to the sobriety and the moral welfare of the people. The\r\ngeneral law, it may be noticed, had some of the clauses which are\r\ncommonly supposed to attach to the later local laws that have been put\r\ninto operation. It contained a permissive clause which allowed of the\r\nformation of companies to control the spirit-sale in towns. One company\r\nmay take the whole of the licenses allotted to any town, guaranteeing a\r\ncertain income to the town from such sale of spirits. In Gothenburg, the\r\nchief port of Sweden, such a company was formed at the suggestion of a\r\ncommittee appointed in 1865 to inquire into the cause of the constant\r\nincrease of pauperism and insanity there, which it charged largely on\r\nthe sale of spirits, especially in dark, unhealthy places. This company,\r\nwhich was called the \"Goteborg Utskankings Bolag,\" began operations in\r\nOctober, 1865, with forty licenses, and acquired by 1868 the whole of\r\nthe public-house licenses for the sale of spirits, with the exception of\r\nabout a dozen, the owners of which had life-licenses. The Bolag, or\r\ncompany, had, with these exceptions, a monopoly of the sale of spirits\r\nin the town in places for consumption on the premises, and a monopoly to\r\nthat extent only. It weeded out some of the worst of these\r\npublic-houses: it improved the condition of the rest, appointing\r\nsalaried managers, who had in addition the profit on the sale of food\r\nand all drinks except spirits, the sale of the latter being under very\r\nstringent regulations for the profit only of the Bolag. The managers\r\nwere compelled to sell food, \"cooked and hot\" if needed; to give no\r\ncredit; to keep orderly, clean and well-ventilated houses; to allow no\r\ndrunkenness; and not to sell spirits to those \"overloaded.\" In the first\r\nten years of its existence the Bolag met with opposition, not only from\r\nspirit-sellers who sold for non-consumption on the premises, but also\r\nfrom the many sellers of ale and porter, who were permitted to sell\r\nthose drinks unnoticed by the law. It is claimed that in spite of this\r\ncompetition the working of the company materially contributed to the\r\nsobriety of the town; and it may be worth while to test this by the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bolag began in 1865 there were, for the police year, 2070 cases\r\nof drunkenness; in 1866 there were only 1424; and there was a decrease\r\nin the next year, and again in 1868, when the number was 1320, which has\r\nproved the minimum. From that period there has been an increase, until\r\nin 1876--the latest year for which the facts are procurable--the number\r\nof cases was 2357. But during the whole of that time the population has\r\nbeen increasing: it was 46,557 in 1866, and in 1876 it was over 66,000;\r\nso that the apparent increase in these years is a proportionate though\r\nvery small decrease--a decrease of about one per cent. There has been\r\nalso a large decrease in the more serious crimes reported to the police\r\nof the town. As to pauperism, there is a decrease in the number of\r\npersons receiving entire relief from the community, but an increase in\r\nthe number of those receiving partial relief. The sales of spirits by\r\nthe company's agents have materially increased, but it is urged that\r\nthis is due to the fact that in its earlier years it had more opposition\r\nto encounter, while in 1875 it had acquired a full monopoly over the\r\nsale of spirits, except in the instances of the life-licenses, which had\r\nbeen reduced in number. Its gross profits have materially increased,\r\nrising from L7200 in English money in 1865 to L52,850 in 1876, and the\r\namount of the net profit it paid into the town treasury had increased\r\nfrom L2800 to L40,100! The authorities of the town are satisfied with\r\nthese results; and there is an almost universal belief that the state of\r\nGothenburg in regard to drunkenness is incomparably better than it would\r\nhave been without the operation of the Bolag: at the same time it is\r\nfair to state that some are of opinion that the benefits have not been\r\nso great as they should have been, and that the company has to some\r\nextent been worked rather with a view to money-making for the community\r\nthan to the repression of drunkenness. As to the general opinion, it is\r\nindicated by the fact that every large town in Sweden has now followed\r\nin the wake of Gothenburg. In 1871 the Norwegian Storthing passed a law\r\nto enable their towns to follow suit; and about a score have adopted a\r\nsimilar scheme, modified by allowing the profits of the Norwegian\r\n\"associations\" to be paid by the members to objects of public utility.\r\n\r\nAs to personal impressions of the working of the system, it may be first\r\nsaid that attention having been so fully directed to the provision made\r\nfor sale of food in these public-houses, this was tested in many with\r\nsatisfactory results--food cheap, plentiful and wholesome being\r\nprocurable. The public-houses were found to be generally neat and\r\norderly, but not equal in comfort or appearance to the public-houses in\r\nother lands, several of them being underground vaults merely. The\r\ncompany has in Gothenburg twenty-five public-houses now; it leases the\r\nright of sale of spirits to eleven eating-houses and clubs; it has seven\r\nspirit-shops and thirteen wholesale places of sale; so that it makes\r\nample provision for the satisfying of the thirsty throats of the Swedes.\r\nUnquestionably, Gothenburg has still a larger amount of drunkenness than\r\nis known in towns of equal size elsewhere, and a few minutes'\r\nobservation near one of these \"model public-houses\" shows that there is\r\na very great sale of drink; but it is also evident that much of the sale\r\non market-days is to country-people from districts where there are no\r\npublic-houses. Finally, the result of some time given to observation and\r\nto the consideration of the question on the spot convinced us that the\r\nstricter regulation and supervision of the sale of spirits in this\r\nmethod has reduced the proportionate drunkenness so far as it is brought\r\nbefore police notice; that the public-houses are improved in appearance\r\nand in order; that the grosser evils are to some extent done away with,\r\nand the community pecuniarily benefited; but that the working of this\r\n\"experiment\" has not succeeded in lessening the exceedingly large local\r\ndemand for spirits.\r\n\r\n  J.W.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN RECRUITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common observation in the mouths of men who are estimating\r\nRussia's military strength that, although short of money, she has at\r\nleast a boundless supply of men; but this idea, though plausible at\r\nfirst sight, is utterly erroneous. A few years ago the confidence of\r\nthe Russian optimists in their \"inexhaustible numbers\" was rudely shaken\r\nby the discovery that in a single year, out of eighty-four thousand\r\nconscripts sent up to the various recruiting centres, no fewer than\r\nforty-four thousand were rejected as unfitted for service by disease or\r\nother physical defects, _not_ inclusive of short stature. The government\r\ntook the alarm, and gave orders for the immediate formation of a medical\r\ncommission and the thorough investigation of the sanitary condition of\r\nthe population at large. This was promptly done, and the result startled\r\nall Russia with the announcement that her strength was barely one-half\r\nwhat it had previously been supposed to be.\r\n\r\nNor is this by any means an over-statement of the case. In European\r\nRussia the weakness in productive ages is such that whereas in Great\r\nBritain the proportion of persons alive between the ages of fifteen and\r\nsixty is 548 in the thousand, and in Belgium 518, in Russia it barely\r\nreaches 265. It is computed that in the government of Pultava alone, by\r\nno means a populous district, not less than one hundred thousand persons\r\nare absolutely disabled by various chronic complaints. Out of the\r\nforty-nine millions of the laboring class, the \"raw material\" of the\r\nRussian army, fully fifty per cent. are practically unfit to serve. The\r\nstatistics of the average duration of human life are even more terribly\r\nsignificant. In England and Northern Germany, according to the best\r\nauthorities, every man lives, on an average, about 40 years; in Southern\r\nGermany, 38 years; and in France, 36. In Russia, on the other hand, the\r\naverage, even in the healthiest regions (_i.e._ the north and west),\r\nvaries from 27 to 22 years. Along the banks of the Volga and in the\r\nsouth-east provinces generally, where the conditions of life are less\r\nfavorable, the proportion falls as low as 20 years, while in the\r\ngovernments of Perm, Viatka and Orenburg it is only 15.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way this glaring evil may be explained away by native\r\napologists, it really springs from two very simple causes--insufficient\r\nwages and popular ignorance. The miserably low scale of wages among the\r\nartisans of the great towns has long since become proverbial, but in the\r\nagricultural districts matters are even worse. The ordinary wages of the\r\nRussian \"field-hand\" are as follows: Laborers by the day, 37-1/2 kopecks\r\n(about 25 cents) per diem; by the month, 23 kopecks (15 cents); by the\r\nseason, 17 kopecks (11 cents); in harvest, 75 kopecks (half a dollar).\r\nFor this pittance the peasants toil from twelve to fifteen, and often\r\nsixteen, hours a day; and, thanks to their insufficient food, the\r\nconstant strain soon begins to tell. A few seasons of such overwork and\r\ntheir strength breaks down altogether, while, instead of the substantial\r\ndiet needed to recruit it, their scanty fare is still further diminished\r\nby the countless fasts of the Greek Church, occurring twice, or even\r\nthrice, a week. Hence, upon the first outbreak of fever or cholera the\r\npoor creatures perish helplessly, thousands upon thousands, while the\r\nSt. Petersburg fashionables, yawning over the printed death-roll,\r\nlanguidly wonder why the lower classes are so careless of their health.\r\nNor are the calamities entailed by superstition less deplorable than\r\nthose which spring from poverty. Those who have seen, in the villages of\r\nthe interior, new-born infants plunged in ice-cold water which it would\r\nbe thought sacrilege to warm; children of four and five running about on\r\na bitter day in the fall of the year with no clothing but a light linen\r\nshirt; cholera-stricken peasants refusing the medicines offered them;\r\nand women employed in hard field-labor three days after their\r\nconfinement,--can easily credit the statement, frightful as it is, that\r\nat least fifty, and in some cases eighty-three, per cent. of the\r\nchildren born in the provinces die in their infancy, and that the\r\npopulation of certain districts has diminished fully one-third during\r\nthe past generation.\r\n\r\n  D.K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETIES OF HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure has passed into a\r\nproverb, and yet there is no doubt that the majority of the cases of\r\nsickness, general ill health and debility, especially with women, arise\r\nfrom a disregard of the simplest rules for health. But how shall the\r\npeople learn these rules unless they are taught them? and who so well\r\nfitted to teach them as the doctors?\r\n\r\nDoes any one say that it is against the interest of the doctors to\r\nprevent disease? The reply would be that such a conception of the\r\nmedical profession is a very low one; for doctors were men before they\r\nacquired their profession, and there is little doubt that they would\r\nfind their profession a much more agreeable, and possibly a more\r\nprofitable, one if, as in China, they were paid for keeping their\r\npatients well, instead of for curing, or trying to cure, them when they\r\nare sick.\r\n\r\nAt least such a conception of his office has occurred to Dr. George\r\nDutton of Springfield, Mass., and he has been engaged for some years in\r\nattempting to have the idea practically introduced in that city. About\r\ntwo years ago he started a Society of Health there with a few members.\r\nThe members, who have now reached about fifty, pay him two dollars each\r\na year for advice and one dollar for the expenses of the society.\r\nWhenever they need his services they call upon him and get his advice\r\ngratis, or he calls upon them at their homes for half price. But this is\r\nthe smallest part of the innovation. By the agreement Dr. Dutton binds\r\nhimself to give them a free lecture once a month upon matters of hygiene\r\nand cognate subjects, either serving as lecturer himself or obtaining\r\nthe services of some competent person for the same duty. When the\r\nsociety was first formed it was made a part of the agreement that the\r\nmembers should annually elect their consulting physician, but so far the\r\nsociety has preferred to elect Dr. Dutton to this position.\r\n\r\nIn these days of enforced combinations for economy there is no reason\r\nwhy such societies of health should not multiply, to the manifest\r\nbenefit of all parties concerned.\r\n\r\n  E.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n     The Cossacks: A Tale of the Caucasus in 1852. By Count Leo Tolstoy.\r\n     Translated from the Russian by Eugene Schuyler. New York: Charles\r\n     Scribner's Sons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian novels, to judge from the specimens that have been presented to\r\nEnglish readers, are prose poems rather than novels in the English sense\r\nof the word, dealing more with poetic phases than with those details and\r\nevents of ordinary life which go to make up English and American novels\r\nof the better class. With whatever elaboration of plot or the reverse,\r\nthey are distinctly artistic compositions, in which every part is in\r\nunison with a dominant idea, and their effect, not being scattered or\r\ndiluted, is single and more or less forcible. Their method is the\r\nreverse of analytical. Nothing, for example, could be further from the\r\npregnant sentences, the exhaustive analysis, of George Eliot, whose\r\nbooks are freighted with the accumulated and ever-accumulating wisdom of\r\na life, than the poetic suggestiveness of Tourgueneff's creations, in\r\nwhich a wealth of material is sacrificed to artistic perfection, and the\r\nhighest thought often seems to lie between the lines. George Eliot lays\r\nbare the innermost souls of her characters--we enter fully into their\r\nlives and thoughts: with Tourgueneff's it is left to a glance of the\r\neye, a few passionate words, to reveal the mind within. In _The\r\nCossacks_ this absence of analysis is still more apparent. It is a\r\npicture of a curious and simple race, painted, not from within, but from\r\nthe outside or Russian point of view. But here is no refining, no\r\naffectation of pastoral simplicity. _The Cossacks_ is distinctly a\r\nprimitive poem, one which can scarcely be classed either as idyl or\r\nepic, though, in spite of its scenes being mainly rural, it perhaps\r\napproaches more nearly to the epic. There is an Homeric simplicity in\r\nits descriptions of half-drunken warriors with their superb physique,\r\ntheir bravado, their native dignity and singleness of character.\r\nMarianka, the beautiful heroine, passes from one picture to another in\r\nher quiet, regular toil. Whether, clad in a loose skirt of pink cotton,\r\nshe drives the oxen or piles the _kizyak_ or dung-fuel along the fence\r\nwith her hoe, or in holiday attire mingles with other girls at evening,\r\nshe is always a subject for the artist's brush. What thoughts occupied\r\nthis stately figure, in what way ideas circulated in her kerchiefed\r\nhead, we are left to divine. Her conduct is a little enigmatical. Had\r\nshe any thought of marrying Olenin, or were her actions dictated by\r\ncoquetry accompanied by a spice of mischief? We are inclined to the\r\nlatter opinion.\r\n\r\nThe story of _The Cossacks_ exhibits a close similarity to that of a\r\nrecent English (or rather Irish) novel, _The Hon. Miss Ferrard_. Both\r\nbooks transport a man of culture to the midst of a rude and more or less\r\nprimitive people: in each, the hero, smitten with the beauty of a native\r\ngirl (and in Olenin's case with the wild freshness of the life), is\r\nseized with a desire to throw off his old life, with its polish, its\r\nintellectual disappointments and its limitations, and become a primitive\r\nman among primitive men. In both, the moral and end are substantially\r\nthe same. The girl's affections are bestowed naturally in her own class,\r\nand the disconsolate urban discovers that a wide divergence of feelings\r\nand sympathies, a gulf not to be voluntarily bridged over, lies between\r\nthe man of the world and the illiterate peasant; that the results of\r\nhabit are not lightly to be got rid of; and that a happiness which lies\r\nbelow us in the social scale may be as unattainable as higher prizes.\r\nThe relations of the romantic and dreamy Olenin to his barbaric\r\nneighbors are finely portrayed. Nothing could be more natural than his\r\npresenting the young Cossack Lukashka with a horse in a fit of generous\r\nenthusiasm, and the latter's astonished and suspicious reception of the\r\ngift. Being utterly unable to divine its motive, he suspects some\r\nlurking design of evil, and regards the generosity as a deceit practised\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nBut any comparison with an English book would but faintly illustrate\r\n_The Cossacks_. In the novelty of its scenes and characters, in its\r\npoetic simplicity of form and its unconscious picturesqueness, it is\r\nwidely different from anything in our literature. It has a certain\r\ncoldness, the coldness of an epic; for passion, though not lacking, is\r\nkept in abeyance in its pages, which are indeed chiefly filled with\r\npictures, a set of literary _chef d'oeuvres_, drawn with great power\r\nand vividness and full, of color and poetic feeling. That the book\r\nshould produce such an impression in a translation so uncouth and\r\nblundering as Mr. Schuyler has given us is a strong testimony to its\r\nmerit. It is usually thought that a translator ought to be tolerably\r\nfamiliar with two languages, but readers of _The Cossacks_ will be\r\nforced to doubt if Mr. Schuyler is acquainted with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Molly Bawn: A Novel. By the author of \"Phyllis.\" Philadelphia: J.\r\n     B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\n_Molly Bawn_ disarms criticism by its exuberant gayety, its lusciousness\r\nof description, its imperturbable good-humor and self-satisfaction, and\r\nits utter absence of responsibility. What can an auld _critic_ do wi' a\r\nyoung _book_? And such a very young book!--so full of sweets and\r\nprettinesses, of audacious coquetries, and of jokes delivered with such\r\na simple and fatuous joy that the meed of our laughter cannot be denied\r\nthem! If we were to suggest that there is rather a surfeit of these good\r\nthings, our objection would be liable to be set aside as the acrid\r\ncavilling of one whose taste for sweetmeats has been vitiated by\r\ndyspeptic tendencies. We can only recommend the book with hearty\r\ngood-will to those whose sweet tooth still preserves its enamel,\r\ncongratulating them upon the acquisition of a novel which may be read\r\nwithout any of those harassing perplexities or dismal ideas in which\r\npetulant authors embroil our tender susceptibilities--a novel in which\r\nthe utmost pathos is in the little poutings of true lovers; in which\r\nkissing goes by favor, and favor is lavishly distributed; in which\r\nugliness is the only crime, and virtue, or rather beauty (which is the\r\nsame thing), is unfailingly triumphant. The stock scenery and\r\nproperties, together with the usual characters of a society novel appear\r\nin _Molly Bawn_; and the personages are invested, if not with the divine\r\ngift of life, with a certain wire-strung movement which does not lack\r\nvivacity, and in some cases novelty; the villain, for example, having\r\nbut little employment in his original capacity, and being utilized as a\r\nlaughing-stock for the amusement of his victims. Even the grammar of the\r\nbook can hardly be taken _au serieux_. It exhibits a serene carelessness\r\nof rules, with a tendency to bulls which suggests that the heroine's\r\nnationality is also that of the author. A sentence in which we are told\r\nof a house that it is \"larger, at first sight, than it in reality is,\"\r\nstrikes a blow at the very essence of things, and those much-abused\r\nwords _will_ and _would_ usurp the place of their relatives, _shall_ and\r\n_should_, with a uniformity that proves the absence of negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Samuel Johnson. By Leslie Stephen. (English Men of Letters, edited\r\n     by John Morley.) New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nThe constant increase of books is not, we are inclined to think, so\r\ngreat a curse or so wholly to be ascribed to malevolent intentions as\r\nmany despondent people suppose. A very considerable, if not the greater,\r\nnumber of new works have for their aim not to add to, but to diminish,\r\nthe literature of the world, and so to lighten the burden imposed on\r\neach successive generation of readers. The great bulk of the writers of\r\nour day are employed not in producing anything new, but in summarizing,\r\nepitomizing, and, as far as possible, suppressing, what their\r\npredecessors produced. Criticisms are offered to us as substitutes for\r\nthe works criticised; volumes are tapped that their sap and pith may be\r\nextracted; the analyst takes our labor upon himself and generously\r\npresents us with the fruits. Up to a certain point the process is\r\nunobjectionable, and we have reason to be grateful to those who are\r\nskilful in it. It used, however, to be thought that there were\r\nlimitations to the practice of it--that while it was lawful and right to\r\ntreat as a _caput mortuum_ any work containing merely a certain amount\r\nof useful information or of original thought, a sacredness attached to\r\nthe masterpieces of literature and to books which, having survived the\r\naccidents of time and changes of fashion, were ranked as classics and\r\n[Greek: ktemata es aei]. These were held entitled to a place in every\r\nlibrary, and, far from being subjected to condensation or abridgment,\r\nwere too often supplemented by commentaries and illustrative matter\r\nexceeding in bulk the original text. It is less than half a century\r\nsince the publication of Croker's edition of Boswell's _Johnson_, \"with\r\nnumerous additions and notes,\" excited a prolonged tumult, and the\r\neditor was arrayed at the bar of criticism and solemnly condemned, not\r\nfor having contributed elucidations to the text, but for having\r\nmutilated it by insertions which should have been relegated to an\r\nappendix. But now, while one literary craftsman announces an edition\r\nfrom which all that is \"obsolete\" or \"unimportant\" is to be expurgated,\r\nanother offers us in lieu of the five venerated tomes a rifacimiento in\r\na single volume of less than two hundred pages. It is, of course, not to\r\nbe denied that Boswell's _Life_ includes a large amount of matter wholly\r\nunimportant in itself, relating to persons and events that have no\r\nindependent claim on the interest of readers of the present day. But it\r\ndoes not follow that such details are superfluous and may properly be\r\nweeded out. They give us the _milieu_, to use M. Taine's word, in which\r\nJohnson's character and intellect were developed and displayed, the\r\nperspective in which his career is to be viewed, the background from\r\nwhich his figure stands out in bold relief. The impression they make\r\nupon us is an essential part of the effect which is produced by the\r\nbook, deepening the sense of reality and the charm of intimate\r\nfamiliarity which have so much to do with its abiding fascination. And\r\nthe style and manner of the narration are no less an integral part of\r\nit. The book is not only a biography, but an autobiography. Johnson\r\nwithout Boswell is Don Quixote without Sancho, Lear without the Fool,\r\nOrestes without Pylades. It is safe to say, not only that a thousand\r\nincidents of Johnson's life and conversation would never have been\r\npreserved but for Boswell, but that some of the most amusing and\r\nremarkable of them would never have occurred. The tour to Scotland and\r\nthe Hebrides, which may be said to have been the one romantic episode of\r\nJohnson's life, bringing him into scenes and among characters widely\r\ncontrasted with his habitual surroundings, is one instance, and the\r\nmemorable midnight \"frisk\" in the neighborhood of the Temple is another,\r\namong many that might be cited. To separate these two men, to reduce\r\nBoswell to the status of a mere \"reporter\" or \"authority,\" to repeat his\r\nstories and records of conversation in any language but his own, to\r\ninterlard them with the comments and reflections of a superior wisdom,\r\nseems to us a sort of moral offence as well as an impertinence. Mr.\r\nLeslie Stephen is, without doubt, a very skilful workman, and has\r\nbrought to his task all the knowledge, taste and judgment, if not the\r\nperfectly sympathetic tone, which the most exacting reader could\r\ndemand. It may, too, be urged on his behalf that he has written for\r\nthose who have not the leisure to make themselves acquainted with the\r\nwork which he has condensed. We can only reply that his talents would\r\nhave found ample scope in a more fitting field, and that people who\r\ncannot spare the time to read Boswell can well afford to be ignorant of\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Concise History of Music from the Commencement of the Christian Era to\r\nthe Present Time.
