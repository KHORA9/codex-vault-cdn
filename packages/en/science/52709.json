Such do not constitute\r\nexperiments, and are but ingenious deceptions, intended to disguise\r\nthe true mode of operation, and we have not desired to make use of or\r\npopularise such methods. We wish, on the contrary, that every game we\r\ndescribe, every pastime or amusement of which we give the exposition,\r\nshould be rigorously based on the scientific method, and looked upon\r\nas a genuine exercise in physics, chemistry, mechanics, or natural\r\nscience. It does not appear to us desirable to teach deception, even in\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nScience in the open air, in the fields, in the sunshine, is our first\r\nstudy; we point out how, in the country, it is possible, pleasantly and\r\nunceasingly, to occupy one’s leisure in observing nature, in capturing\r\ninsects or aquatic animals, or in noting atmospheric phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe next teach a complete course of physics without any apparatus, and\r\npoint out the methods for studying the different phenomena of heat,\r\nlight, optics, and electricity, by means of a simple water-bottle,\r\ntumbler, stick of sealing-wax, and other ordinary objects, such as\r\neveryone has at hand. A series of chemical experiments, performed by\r\nmeans of some phials and inexpensive appliances, completes that part of\r\nthe book relating to the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of recreation, both intelligent and useful, consists\r\nin collecting the ingenious inventions which are constantly being\r\nsupplied to our requirements by the applied sciences, and learning how\r\nto use them. We have collected a number of mechanical inventions and\r\nappliances, with which most ingenious and skilful people will wish to\r\nsupply themselves, from Edison’s electric pen, or the chromograph,\r\nwhich will produce a large number of copies of a letter, drawing, etc.,\r\nto the more complicated, but not less valuable contrivances, for making\r\nscience useful in the house.\r\n\r\nHaving described some scientific toys for the young, we have\r\nendeavoured to point out those interesting to persons of riper years,\r\nand have grouped together curious systems of locomotion, and ingenious\r\nmechanical appliances, such as small steam-boats, ice-boats, swimming\r\napparatus, etc., under proper heads.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing subjects, we have included some of the\r\nexperimental details of Chemical Science, with illustrations. We have\r\nadded a chapter upon Aërial Navigation and Ballooning, with anecdotes\r\nof some of our celebrated aëronauts. We have also enlarged upon Light,\r\nSound, Heat, Physical Geography, Mineralogy, Geology, Electrical\r\nAppliances, the Electric Light, and most of the latest adaptations of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the present work is not only\r\nintended for the young; everyone, it is hoped, will find in it\r\nsomething interesting and also profitable, which, if not desired for\r\nself-instruction, may at any rate be turned to account as a means of\r\nteaching others that science, which is universal, can, when rightly\r\napprehended, preside even over our pleasures and amusements.\r\n\r\n  THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.—INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n        PAGE\r\n\r\n  Science and Recreation—The Book of Nature—The Senses—Natural\r\n

To those who study science\r\nwith us, we will point out first how easy and pleasant it is to watch\r\nthe sky and the plants and Nature generally in the open air. Then we\r\nwill carry our readers along with us, and by means of illustrations\r\nand diagrams instruct them pleasantly in the _reasons for_ things.\r\n“How?” and “Why?” will be questions fully answered. Not only will the\r\nusual scientific courses be touched upon, but we will show how Science\r\nis applied to Domestic Economy. We will have Chemistry put before us\r\nwithout needing a laboratory, and we will experiment in Physics without\r\nelaborate apparatus. We will have, in short, a complete Encyclopædia of\r\nScience free from dryness and technicalities—an amusing volume suited\r\nto old and young who wish to find out what is going on around them in\r\ntheir daily life in earth and sea and sky.\r\n\r\nBernard Palissy used to say that he wished “no other book than the\r\nearth and the sky,” and that “it was given to all to read this\r\nwonderful book.”\r\n\r\nIt is indeed by the study of the material world that discoveries are\r\naccomplished. Let an attentive observer watch a ray of light passing\r\nfrom the air into water, and he will see it deviate from the straight\r\nline by refraction; let him seek the origin of a sound, and he will\r\ndiscover that it results from a shock or a vibration. This is physical\r\nscience in its infancy. It is said that Newton was led to discover the\r\nlaws of universal gravitation by beholding an apple fall to the ground,\r\nand that Montgolfier first dreamt of air-balloons while watching fogs\r\nfloating in the atmosphere. The idea of the inner chamber of the eye\r\nmay, in like manner, be developed in the mind of any observer, who,\r\nseated beneath the shade of a tree, looks fixedly at the round form of\r\nthe sun through the openings in the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Luminous Cross seen at Havre, May 7th, 1877. Sketched\r\nfrom Nature.]\r\n\r\nEvery one, of course, may not possess the ambition to make such\r\ndiscoveries, but there is no one who cannot compel himself to learn to\r\nenjoy the pleasure that can be derived from the observation of Nature.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that in order to cultivate science it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to have laboratories and scientific work-rooms.\r\nThe book of which Palissy spoke is ever present; its pages are always\r\nopen, wherever we turn our eyes or direct our steps. So we may hope to\r\nintroduce all our friends to a pleasant and lasting acquaintance with\r\nDame Nature.\r\n\r\n“But what _is_ Nature?” We are fond of admiring Nature, and the effects\r\nof certain causes in the world, and we want to know why things are so.\r\nVery well—so you shall; and as to the question “What is Nature?” we\r\nwill endeavour to answer you at once.\r\n\r\nNature is the united totality of all that the various Senses can\r\nperceive. In fact, all that cannot be made by man is termed “Nature”;\r\n_i.e._, God’s creation.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages man has sought to read the open leaves of the\r\nBook of Nature, and even now, with all our attainments, we cannot grasp\r\nall, or nearly all. One discovery only leads up to another. Cause and\r\nEffect are followed up step by step till we lose ourselves in the\r\nsearch. Every effect must have a cause. One thing depends upon another\r\nin the world, and it does not need Divine revelation to tell us that.\r\nNothing happens by “mere chance.” “Chance!” said a Professor to us at\r\nthe University, “Chance!—Remember, there is no such thing in the world\r\nas chance.”\r\n\r\nBetween our minds or consciousness and Nature are our Senses. We feel,\r\nwe see, we hear, we taste, we smell,—so it is only through the Senses\r\nthat we can come to any knowledge of the outer world. These attributes,\r\nor Senses, act directly upon a certain “primary faculty” called\r\nConsciousness, and thus we are enabled to understand what is going\r\non around us. The more this great existing faculty is educated and\r\ntrained, the more useful it will become. So if we accustom our minds to\r\nobservation of Nature, we shall find out certain causes and effects,\r\nand discover Objects. Now an Object is a thing perceptible both to\r\nfeeling and sight, and an Object occupies space. Therefore there are\r\nobjects Artificial as well as Natural. The former are created by man\r\nfrom one or more Natural products. Natural Objects are those such as\r\ntrees, rocks, plants, and animals. We may also class the heavenly\r\nbodies, etc., as Objects, though we cannot touch them, but we can feel\r\ntheir effects, and see them. The PHENOMENA of Nature include\r\nthose results which are perceptible by only one sense, as thunder;\r\nlight and sound may also be classed as Phenomena.\r\n\r\nTake a familiar instance. A stone is a Natural Object. We take it\r\nup, open our fingers, and it falls. The _motion_ of that object is a\r\nPhenomenon. We know it falls because we see it fall, and it possesses\r\nwhat we term _weight_; but we cannot tell _why_ it possesses weight.\r\n\r\n[Professor Huxley says: “Stones do not fall to the ground in\r\nconsequence of a law of nature,” for a law is not a cause. “A law of\r\nnature merely tells us what we may expect natural objects will do\r\nunder certain circumstances.”]\r\n\r\nA cause of a Phenomenon being independent of human will is called a\r\n_Force_, and the stone falls by the force of _Gravitation_, or that\r\nnatural law which compels every material object to approach every other\r\nmaterial object.\r\n\r\nA single Force may produce a great number of Phenomena.\r\n\r\nNature being revealed to us by Objects, and by means of Phenomena, we\r\nhave got already two Branches of Science extending from such Roots;\r\nviz., NATURAL HISTORY, the Science of Objects; and NATURAL\r\nPHILOSOPHY, the Science of Phenomena.\r\n\r\nBoth of these Branches have been subdivided thus:\r\n\r\n                      { Zoology, referring to Animals } Biology.\r\n  Natural History     { Botany, referring to Plants   }\r\n                      { Mineralogy } referring to Minerals, etc.\r\n                      { Geology    }\r\n\r\n                      { Physics. Phenomena without essential change\r\n  Natural Philosophy  {     of the Objects.\r\n                      { Chemistry. Phenomena with change of the Objects.\r\n                      { Physiology. Phenomena of animated Objects.\r\n\r\nThese two great divisions comprehend, in their extended senses, all\r\nthat is known respecting the material world.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of Objects. Objects occupy _Space_. What is Space?\r\nSpace is magnitude which can be conceived as extending in three\r\ndirections—_Length_, _Breadth_, and _Depth_. MATTER occupies\r\nportions of Space, which is infinite. Matter, when finite, is termed\r\na body or object. The general properties of Matter are _Magnitude_,\r\n_Form_, _Impenetrability_, _Inertia_, _Divisibility_, _Porosity_,\r\n_Elasticity_, _Compressibility_, _Expansibility_.\r\n\r\nMatter is present in Nature in three conditions. We find it as a SOLID,\r\na LIQUID, and a GAS. We shall explain the various properties of Solids,\r\nLiquids, and Gases in their proper places (in Physics). To test the\r\nactual existence of Matter in one or other of these forms our Senses\r\nhelp us. We can touch a Solid, or taste it and see it. But touch is\r\nthe test. We have said that Matter possesses certain properties. We\r\nwill examine these briefly. The two which belong to all material bodies\r\nare Impenetrability and Magnitude. You cannot, _strictly speaking_,\r\npenetrate Matter. You can find the form of an object by touch or sight,\r\nbut you cannot penetrate it. You will think you can drive a nail or a\r\nscrew into a board, but you cannot; you only _displace_ the fibres of\r\nthe wood by the screw. Take water as a very common instance. Water is\r\nMatter, for it occupies a certain space. Water is _impenetrable_, for\r\nif you put your hand or foot into a basin full of it, it will overflow,\r\nthus proving that you displace, and do not penetrate it. It is almost\r\nimpossible to compress water.\r\n\r\n_Divisibility_ is another quality of Matter; and when we attempt to\r\nshow how far Matter can be divided, the brain refuses to grasp the\r\ninfinity. A pin’s head is a small object, but it is gigantic compared\r\nto some animals, of which millions would occupy a space no larger\r\nthan the head of a pin. These tiny animals must contain organs and\r\nveins, etc., and those veins are full of blood globules. Professor\r\nTyndall informs us that a drop of blood contains three millions of red\r\nglobules. So these infinitesimally small animals must have millions of\r\nglobules in their blood also. Thus we see to what an extent, far beyond\r\nour Senses’ power to grasp, Matter can be divided.\r\n\r\nBut there is something even more astonishing than this. It is stated\r\nthat there are more animals in the milt of a single codfish than there\r\nare men in the world; and that _one grain of sand is larger than four\r\nmillions of these animals_! each of which must be possessed of life\r\ngerms of an equal amount, which would grow up as it grew to maturity.\r\nThis carries us back again, and\r\n\r\n    “Imagination’s utmost stretch\r\n      In wonder dies away.”\r\n\r\nOr take other interesting facts. One hundred threads of the silkworm\r\nmust be placed side by side to make up the thickness of a line (—)\r\nabout 1/25th of an inch; and metals can be drawn out to such exceeding\r\nfineness that twelve hundred of the fine wires will occupy only the\r\nspace of one hundred silkworms’ threads, or one _millimetre_.\r\n\r\n_Porosity_ is another attribute of Matter, for in all Matter there are\r\npores, or spaces, between the particles. Sometimes such openings are\r\nplainly visible; in very “solid” bodies they are, to a great extent,\r\nindistinguishable. But we know that the spaces exist, because we can\r\n_compress_ the particles together.\r\n\r\n_Inertia_ is also a general property of Matter, and the meaning of\r\nthe term is “inactivity,” or passiveness—a want of power in an object\r\nto move, or when moving, to stop of itself. It will come to rest\r\napparently by itself, but the resistance of the air and the friction of\r\nthe ground, or the attraction of the earth, will really occasion the\r\nstoppage of the object. We will speak more fully of Inertia presently.\r\nElasticity and Expansibility are evident in fluids and gases.\r\n\r\nWe have thus introduced our readers to some of the most evident facts\r\nconnected with Matter. The various Forces and Phenomena of attraction\r\nwill be fully considered farther on; at present we are about to show\r\nour readers how they may first profitably study Science in the open air\r\nfor themselves, and we will give them our experience of the Book of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n SCIENCE IN THE OPEN AIR—APHIDES—EVAPORATION BY LEAVES—AN AQUARIUM—THE\r\n CATALEPTIC FOWL—NEEDLE POINTS AND THORNS—MICROSCOPIC AQUARIUM—CAPE\r\n GRISNEZ—CRYSTALS—ICE ON THE GAS LAMPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—Ants engaged in extracting aphides from a\r\nrose-tree (highly magnified)]\r\n\r\nSome years ago we were staying in Normandy, not far from the town\r\nof C——, enjoying, in the midst of most cordial hospitality, the\r\npeacefulness of country life; and my kind hosts, with me, took great\r\npleasure in having what we called “a course of science in the open\r\nair.” The recollections of that time are some of the pleasantest in\r\nthe whole course of my life, because all our leisure was intelligently\r\noccupied. Each of us set himself to provide the subject of some curious\r\nobservation or instructive experiment; one made a collection of\r\ninsects, another studied botany. In the daytime we might have been seen\r\nexamining, under a magnifying glass, the branch of a rose-tree, from\r\nwhich the ants were endeavouring to extract the aphides[1] (fig. 1).\r\nAt night we admired through the telescope the stars and planets that\r\nwere visible; or if the sky was not clear, we examined under a strong\r\nmagnifier grains of pollen from flowers, or the _infusoria_ in a drop\r\nof stagnant water. Frequently some very insignificant object became\r\nthe occasion for some scientific discussion, which terminated with an\r\nexperimental verification.\r\n\r\nI recollect that one day one of us remarked that after a week of dry\r\nweather a stream of water had nearly dried up, although sheltered by\r\nthick trees, which necessarily impeded the calorific action of the sun;\r\nand he expressed surprise at the rapid evaporation. An agriculturist\r\namong the company, however, drew his attention to the fact that the\r\nroots of the trees were buried in the course of the stream, and that,\r\nfar from preventing the evaporation of the water, the leaves had\r\ncontributed to accelerate it. As the first speaker was not convinced,\r\nthe agriculturist, on our return to the house, prepared an experiment\r\nrepresented in fig. 2. He placed the branch of a tree covered with\r\nfoliage in a U-shaped tube, the two branches of unequal diameter, and\r\nfilled with water. He placed the vegetable stem in the water, and\r\nsecured it to the tube by means of a cork covered with a piece of\r\nindia-rubber, and tied tightly to make it hermetically closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Experiment showing evaporation of water by\r\nleaves.]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the experiment the water was level with A in\r\nthe larger branch of the tube, and level with B in the smaller, rising\r\nby capillarity to a higher point in the more slender of the two. The\r\nevaporation of the water caused by the leaves was so active that in a\r\nvery short time we beheld the water sink to the points C and C′.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Aquarium formed by means of a melon glass.]\r\n\r\nThus did the excellent method of seeking the cause of phenomena by\r\nexperiments often lead us to interesting results. We had among us many\r\nchildren and young people who had reached the age of ardent curiosity.\r\nWe took pleasure in pointing out to them the means of studying natural\r\nscience; and we were not long before feeling convinced that our lessons\r\nout in the fields had much greater success than those given between\r\nthe four walls of a class-room. Insects were collected, and preserved\r\nby being carefully placed in a small bottle, into which was let fall a\r\ndrop of sulphuret of carbon;[2] the insect was immediately asphyxiated,\r\nand we thus avoided the cruelty of passing a pin through a living\r\nbody. Having chased butterflies and insects, we next desired to study\r\nthe aquatic creatures which swarmed in the pools of the neighbourhood.\r\nFor this purpose I constructed a fishing-net fitted to an iron ring,\r\nand firmly secured to a wooden handle. When this was plunged under the\r\nwater and drawn quickly out again, it came back full of slime. In the\r\nmidst of this muddy substance one generally succeeded in finding the\r\nhydrophilus, tadpoles, coleoptera, many curious kinds of caddis-worms,\r\ntritons, and sometimes frogs, completely astounded by the rapidity of\r\ntheir capture. All these creatures were transported in a bottle to the\r\nhouse, and I then constructed, at small expense, a glass aquarium, by\r\nmeans of the bell of a melon-glass turned upside down, thus forming a\r\ntransparent receptacle of considerable size. Four wooden stakes were\r\nthen fixed in the ground, and a plank with a circular hole nailed on\r\nthe top, in which the glass bell was placed. I next scattered some\r\nlarge pebbles and shells at the bottom of the vase to form a stony bed,\r\npoured in some water, placed a few reeds and water plants among the\r\npebbles, and then threw a handful of water lentils on the surface;\r\nthus a comfortable home was contrived for all the captured animals.[3]\r\nThe aquarium, when placed under the shade of a fine tree in a rustic\r\nspot abounding with field flowers, became a favourite rendezvous, and\r\nwe often took pleasure in watching the antics of the little inmates\r\n(fig. 3). Sometimes we beheld very sanguinary scenes; the voracious\r\nhydrophilus would seize a poor defenceless tadpole, and rend him in\r\npieces for a meal without any compunction. The more robust tritons\r\ndefended themselves better, but sometimes they also succumbed in the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Cage for preserving living insects.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—Small aquarium, with frogs’ ladder.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the aquarium was so complete that one of us resolved to\r\ncontinue this museum in miniature, and one day provided himself with an\r\n_insects palace_, which nearly made us forget the tadpoles and tritons.\r\nIt was a charming little cage, having the form of a house, covered\r\nwith a roof; wires placed at equal distances forming the sides. In it\r\nwas a large cricket beside a leaf of lettuce, which served as his food\r\n(fig. 4). The little creature moved up and down his prison, which was\r\nsuspended from the branch of a tree, and when one approached him very\r\nclosely gave vent to his lively chirps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Frog lying in wait for a fly.]\r\n\r\nThe menagerie was soon further augmented by a hitherto unthought-of\r\nobject; namely, a frogs’ ladder. It was made with much skill. A large\r\nbottle served for the base of the structure. The ladder which was fixed\r\nin it was composed of the twigs of very small branches, recently cut\r\nfrom a tree, and undivested of their bark, which gave to the little\r\nedifice a more picturesque and rustic appearance. The pieces of wood,\r\ncleverly fixed into two posts, conducted the green frogs (tree-frogs)\r\non to a platform, whence they ascended the steps of a genuine ladder.\r\nThere they could disport themselves at pleasure, or climb up further\r\nto a branch of birch-tree placed upright in the centre of the bottle\r\n(fig. 5). A net with fine meshes prevented the little animals from\r\nescaping. We gave the tree-frogs flies for their food, and sometimes\r\nthey caught them with remarkable dexterity. I have often seen a frog\r\nwhen at liberty watching a fly, on which it pounces as a cat does on\r\na bird (fig. 6). The observations that we made on the animals of our\r\nmenagerie led us to undertake others of a very different nature; I\r\nrecollect particularly a case of catalepsy produced in a cock. I will\r\ndescribe this remarkable experiment, certainly one of the most curious\r\nwe ever performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—Experiment of the cataleptic cock.]\r\n\r\nWe place a cock on a table of dark colour, rest its beak on the\r\nsurface, where it is firmly held, and with a piece of chalk slowly draw\r\na white line in continuation from the beak, as shown in our engraving.\r\nIf the crest is thick, it is necessary to draw it back, so that the\r\nanimal may follow with his eyes the tracing of the line. When the line\r\nhas reached a length of about two feet the cock has become cataleptic.\r\nHe is absolutely motionless, his eyes are fixed, and he will remain\r\nfrom thirty to sixty seconds in the same posture in which he had at\r\nfirst only been held by force. His head remains resting on the table\r\nin the position shown in fig. 7. This experiment, which we have\r\nsuccessfully performed on different animals, can also be accomplished\r\nby drawing a straight line with a piece of chalk on a slate. M. Azam\r\ndeclares that the same result is also produced by drawing a black line\r\non a table of white wood. According to M. Balbiani, German students had\r\nformerly a great predilection for this experiment, which they always\r\nperformed with marked success. Hens do not, when operated on, fall\r\ninto a cataleptic condition so easily as cocks; but they may often be\r\nrendered motionless by holding their heads fixed in the same position\r\nfor several minutes. The facts we have just cited come properly under\r\nthe little studied phenomena, designated by M. Braid in 1843 by the\r\ntitle of _Hypnotism_. MM. Littré and Ch. Robin have given a description\r\nof the hypnotic condition in their _Dictionnaire de Médecine_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—Ordinary pin and needle, seen through a\r\nmicroscope (magnified 500 diameters).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—Thorn of a rose, and wasp’s sting through a\r\nmicroscope (magnified 500 diameters).]\r\n\r\nIf any shining object, such as a lancet, or a disc of silver-paper\r\ngummed to a plate, is placed at about the distance of a foot from the\r\neyes of a person, slightly above the head, and the patient regards\r\nthis object fixedly, and without interruption for twenty or thirty\r\nminutes, he will become gradually motionless, and in a great number\r\nof cases will fall into a condition of torpor and genuine sleep. Dr.\r\nBraid affirms that under such circumstances he has been able to perform\r\nsurgical operations, without the patient having any consciousness of\r\npain. Later also, M. Azam has proved the complete insensibility to\r\npricking on the part of individuals whom he has rendered cataleptic by\r\nthe fixing of a brilliant object. The experiment of the cataleptic\r\ncock was first described under the name of _Experimentum Mirabile_,\r\nby P. Kircher, in his _Ars Magna_, published at Rome in 1646. It\r\nevidently belongs to the class of experiments which were performed\r\nat the Salpêtrière asylum at Paris, by M. Charcot, on patients\r\nsuffering from special disorders. It must now be evident to our\r\nreaders that our scientific occupations were sufficiently varied,\r\nand that we easily found around us many objects of study. When the\r\nweather was wet and cloudy we remained indoors, and devoted ourselves\r\nto microscopical examinations. Everything that came under our hands,\r\ninsects, vegetables, etc., were worthy of observation. One day, while\r\nengaged over a microscopical preparation, I was making use of one of\r\nthose steel points generally employed in such purposes, when happening\r\nto pass it accidentally beneath the microscope, I was astonished to\r\nsee how rough and uneven it appeared when highly magnified. The idea\r\nthen occurred to me to have recourse to something still more pointed,\r\nand I was thus led to make comparisons between the different objects\r\nrepresented in figs. 8 and 9. It will here be seen how very coarse\r\nis the product of our industry when compared with the product of\r\nNature. No. 1 of fig. 8 represents the point of a pin that has already\r\nbeen used, magnified 500 diameters. The point is evidently slightly\r\nblunted and flattened. The malleable metal has yielded a little under\r\nthe pressure necessary to make it pass through a material. No. 2 is\r\na little more pointed; it is a needle. This, too, will be seen to be\r\ndefective when regarded by the aid of the microscope. On the other\r\nhand, what fineness and delicacy do the rose thorn and wasp’s sting\r\npresent when examined under the same magnifier! (See the two points in\r\nfig. 9.)\r\n\r\nAn examination of this exact drawing has led me to make a calculation\r\nwhich leads to rather curious results: at a half millimetre from the\r\npoint, the diameters of the four objects represented are in thousandths\r\nof a millimetre respectively, 3·4; 2·2; 1·1; 0·38. The corresponding\r\nsections in millionths of a square millimetre are: 907·92; 380·13;\r\n95·03; 11·34; or, in round numbers, 908; 380; 95; 11.\r\n\r\nIf one bears in mind, which is much below the truth, that the pressure\r\nexercised on the point must be proportional to the section, and\r\nadmitting that a pressure of 11 centigrams suffices to thrust in the\r\nsting of a wasp half a millimetre, it will require more than 9 grams\r\nof pressure to thrust in a needle to the same extent. In fact, this\r\nlatter figure is much too small, for we have not taken into account the\r\nadvantage resulting from the elongated shape of the rose thorn, which\r\nrenders it more favourable for penetration than a needle through a drop\r\nof tallow.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to extend observations of this kind to a number\r\nof other objects, and the remarks I have just made on natural and\r\nartificial points will apply incontestably to textures for example.\r\nThere is no doubt that the thread of a spider’s web would far surpass\r\nthe thread of the finest lace, and that art will always find itself\r\ncompletely distanced by nature.\r\n\r\nWe amused ourselves frequently by examining the _infusoria_ which are\r\nso easily procured by taking from some stagnant water the mucilage\r\nadhering to the vegetation on the banks, or attached to the lower part\r\nof water lentils. In this way we easily captured _infusoria_, which,\r\nwhen placed under a strong magnifier, presented the most remarkable\r\nspectacle that one can imagine. They are animalcules, having the form\r\nof transparent tulips attached to a long stem. They form bunches\r\nwhich expand and lengthen; then, suddenly, they are seen to contract\r\nwith such considerable rapidity that the eye can scarcely follow the\r\nmovement, and all the stems and flower-bells are folded up into the\r\nform of a ball. Then, in another moment, the stems lengthen, and the\r\ntulip-bells open once more. One can easily encourage the production\r\nof _infusoria_ by constructing a small microscopic aquarium, in which\r\none arranges the centre in a manner favourable to the development of\r\nthe lowest organisms. It suffices to put a few leaves (a piece of\r\nparsley answers the purpose perfectly)[4] in a small vase containing\r\nwater (fig. 10), over which a glass cover is placed, and it is then\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun. In two or three days’ time, a drop of\r\nthis water seen under the microscope will exhibit _infusoria_. After a\r\ncertain time, too, the different species will begin to show themselves.\r\nMicroscopical observations can be made on a number of different\r\nobjects. Expose to the air some flour moistened by water, and before\r\nlong a mouldiness will form on it; it is the _penicillium glaucum_,\r\nand when examined under a magnifier of 200 to 300 diameters, cells are\r\ndistinguishable, branching out from an organism remarkable for its\r\nsimplicity. We often amused ourselves by examining, almost at hazard,\r\neverything that came within our reach, and sometimes we were led to\r\nmake very instructive investigations. When the sky was clear, and the\r\nweather favourable to walking, we encouraged our young people to run\r\nabout in the fields and chase butterflies. The capture of butterflies\r\nis accomplished, as every one knows, by means of a gauze net, with\r\nwhich we provided the children, and the operation of chasing afforded\r\nthem some very salutary exercise. It sometimes happens that butterflies\r\nabound in such numbers, that it is comparatively easy to capture them.\r\nDuring the month of June 1879, a large part of Western Europe was\r\nthronged with swarms of _Vanessa algina_ butterflies, in such numbers\r\nthat their appearance was regarded as an important event, and attracted\r\nthe lively attention of all entomologists (fig. 11). This passage of\r\nbutterflies provided the occasion for many interesting studies on the\r\npart of naturalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—Arrangement of a microscopic aquarium for\r\nexamining _infusoria_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—Flight of butterflies seen near Berne, June\r\n15th, 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—Group of rock crystal.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot point out too strongly to our readers that the essential\r\ncondition for the student of natural science, is the possession of\r\nthat sacred fire which imparts the energy and perseverance necessary\r\nfor acquiring and enlarging collections. It is also necessary that\r\nthe investigator should furnish himself with certain indispensable\r\ntools. For collecting plants, the botanist should be armed with a\r\npickaxe set in a thoroughly strong handle, a trowel, of which there\r\nis a variety of shapes, and a knife with a sharp blade. A botanical\r\ncase must also be included, for carrying the plants. The geologist,\r\nor mineralogist, needs no more elaborate instruments; a hammer, a\r\nchisel, and a pickaxe with a sharp point for breaking the rocks, and a\r\nbag for carrying the specimens, will complete his outfit. We amused\r\nourselves by having these instruments made by the blacksmith, sometimes\r\neven by manufacturing them ourselves; they were simple, but solid, and\r\nadmirably adapted to the requirements of research. Often we directed\r\nour walks to the seashore, where we liked to collect shells on the\r\nsandy beach, or fossils among the cliffs and rocks. I recollect, in a\r\nwalk I had taken some years previously along the foot of the cliffs of\r\nCape Blanc-Nez, near Calais, having found an impression of an ammonite\r\nof remarkable size, which has often excited the admiration of amateurs;\r\nthis ammonite measured no less than twelve inches in diameter. The\r\nrocks of Cape Grisnez, not far from Boulogne, also afford the geologian\r\nthe opportunity of a number of curious investigations. In the Ardennes\r\nand the Alps I have frequently procured some fine mineral specimens; in\r\nthe first locality crystallized pyrites, in the second, fine fragments\r\nof rock crystal (fig. 12). I did not fail to recount these successful\r\nexpeditions to the young people who accompanied me, and their ardour\r\nwas thereby inflamed by the hope that they also should find something\r\nvaluable. It often happened when the sun was powerful, and the air\r\nextremely calm, that my young companions and I remarked some very\r\nbeautiful effects of mirage on the beach, due to the heating of the\r\nlower _strata_ of the atmosphere. The trees and houses appeared to\r\nbe raised above a sheet of silver, in which their reflections were\r\nvisible as in a sheet of tranquil water. It can hardly be believed how\r\nfrequently the atmosphere affords interesting spectacles which pass\r\nunperceived before the eyes of those who know not how to observe. I\r\nrecollect having once beheld at Jersey a magnificent phenomenon of\r\nthis nature, on the 24th June, 1877, at eight o’clock in the evening:\r\nit was a column of light which rose above the sinking sun like a\r\nsheaf of fire. I was walking on the St. Helier pier, where there were\r\nalso many promenaders, but there were not more than two or three who\r\nregarded with me this mighty spectacle. Columns and crosses of light\r\nare much more frequent than is commonly supposed, but they often\r\npass unperceived before indifferent spectators. We will describe an\r\nexample of this phenomenon observed at Havre on the 7th May, 1877.\r\nThe sun formed the centre of the cross, which was of a yellow, golden\r\ncolour. This cross had four branches. The upper branch was much more\r\nbrilliant than the others; its height was about 15°. The lower branch\r\nwas smaller, as seen in the sketch on page 2, taken from nature by\r\nMonsieur Albert Tissandier. The two horizontal branches were at times\r\nscarcely visible, and merged in a streak of reddish-yellow colour,\r\nwhich covered a large part of the horizon. A mass of cloud, which the\r\nsetting sun tinged with a deep violet colour, formed the foreground of\r\nthe picture. The atmosphere over the sea was very foggy. The phenomenon\r\ndid not last more than a quarter of an hour, but the conclusion of\r\nthe spectacle was signalized by an interesting circumstance. The two\r\nhorizontal branches, and the lower branch of the luminous cross,\r\ncompletely disappeared, whilst the upper branch remained alone for some\r\nminutes longer. It had now the appearance of a _vertical column_ rising\r\nfrom the sun, like that which Cassini studied on the 21st May, 1672,\r\nand that which M. Renon[5] and M. A. Guillemin observed on the 12th\r\nJuly, 1876.[6] Vertical columns, which, it is well known, are extremely\r\nrare phenomena, may therefore indicate the existence of a luminous\r\ncross, which certain atmospheric conditions have rendered but partially\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nHow often one sees along the roads little whirlwinds of dust raised\r\nby the wind accomplishing a rotatory movement, thus producing the\r\nimitation of a waterspout! How often halos encompass with a circle of\r\nfire the sun or the stars! How often we see the rainbow develop its\r\niridescent beauties in the midst of a body of air traversed by bright\r\nraindrops! And there is not one of these great natural manifestations\r\nwhich may not give rise to instructive observations, and become the\r\nobject of study and research. Thus, in walks and travels alike, the\r\nstudy of Science may always be exercised; and this method of study and\r\ninstruction in the open air contributes both to health of body and\r\nof mind. As we consider the spectacles which Nature spreads before\r\nus,—from the insect crawling on the blade of grass, to the celestial\r\nbodies moving in the dome of the heavens,—we feel a vivifying and\r\nsalutary influence awaken in the mind. The habit of observation, too,\r\nmay be everywhere exercised—even in towns, where Nature still asserts\r\nherself; as, for example, in displays of meteorological phenomena. We\r\nwill give an example of such.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—Icicles on gas lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary abundance of snow which fell in Paris for more than\r\nten consecutive hours, commencing on the afternoon of Wednesday,\r\nJanuary 22nd, 1880, will always be looked upon as memorable among\r\nthe meteorological events of the city of Paris. It was stated that\r\nin the centre of Paris, the thickness of the snow that had fallen at\r\ndifferent times exceeded fourteen inches. The snow had been preceded by\r\na fall of small transparent icicles, of rather more than a millimetre\r\nin diameter, some having crystalline facets. They formed on the\r\nsurface of the ground a very slippery glazed frost. On the evening\r\nof the 22nd January, flakes of snow began to hover in the atmosphere\r\nlike voluminous masses of wool. The greater part of the gas-lamps\r\nwere ornamented by frozen stalactites, which continually attracted\r\nthe attention of passers-by. The formation of these stalactites, of\r\nwhich we give a specimen (fig. 13), is easy of explanation. The snow\r\nfalling on the glass of the lamp became heated by the flame of gas,\r\nmelted, and trickled down, freezing anew into the shape of a stalactite\r\nbelow the lamp, at a temperature of 0° centigrade. Not only can\r\nmeteorology be studied in towns, but certain other branches of natural\r\nscience—entomology, for example. We will quote what a young student\r\nin science, M. A. Dubois, says on this very subject: “Coleoptera,”\r\nhe declares, “are to be met with everywhere, and I think it may be\r\nuseful to notice this fact, supporting it by examples. I desire to\r\nprove that there are in the midst of our large towns spots that remain\r\nunexplored, where some fine captures are to be made. Let us visit, at\r\ncertain times, the approaches to the quays, even at low tide, and we\r\nshall be surprised to find there species which we have searched for\r\nfar and near.” This opinion is confirmed by the enumeration of several\r\ninteresting captures.\r\n\r\nWas not the great Bacon right when he said, “For the keen observer,\r\nnothing in Nature is mute”?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The cliffs of Cape Grisnez.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is well known that ants, by touching the skin of aphides,\r\nextract therefrom a secretion of viscous matter, which nourishes them.\r\nThey will frequently carry off the aphides to their habitations, and\r\nkeep them there; thus one may say they _keep a cow in their stable_.\r\n\r\n[2] The preservation of insects, and their preparation for collections,\r\nnecessitates some precaution. Entomologists are in the habit of\r\nspreading them out on a small board, and arranging the legs and\r\n_antennæ_ by means of large pins. The wings should be dried by placing\r\nthem on strips of paper, which preserves them. These precautions are\r\nindispensable if it is wished that the insects in a collection should\r\nretain their distinctive characters. Worms and caterpillars can be\r\nraised in pots filled with earth, if carefully covered over with muslin\r\nor wire gauze with very fine meshes. The process of hatching may give\r\nrise to many interesting observations.\r\n\r\n[3] It frequently happens that in a small aquarium, constructed after\r\nthis fashion, the animals escape.

A.\r\nGuillemin mentions, in connection with the phenomenon of July 12th,\r\n1876, the presence of light masses of cloud of a greyish-blue colour,\r\nsimilar to those perceived in the phenomena just described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n PHYSICS—THE MEANING OF PHYSICS—FORCES OF\r\n NATURE—GRAVITY—COHESION—CHEMICAL ATTRACTION—CENTRE OF\r\n GRAVITY—EXPERIMENTS—AUTOMATON TUMBLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now introduced our readers to Science which they can find for\r\nthemselves in the open air, and the pursuit of which will both instruct\r\nand amuse, we will proceed to investigate the Branch of Science called\r\nPHYSICS.\r\n\r\nPHYSICS may be briefly described as the Branch of Natural\r\nScience which treats of such phenomena as are unaccompanied by any\r\nimportant changes in the objects wherein such phenomena are observed.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the sounding of a bell or the falling of a stone are\r\nphysical phenomena, for the objects which cause the sound, or the fall,\r\nundergo no change. Heat is set free when coal burns. This disengagement\r\nof heat is a physical phenomenon; but the change during combustion\r\nwhich coal undergoes is a _chemical_ phenomenon. So the objects may\r\nbe the same, but the circumstances in which they are placed, and the\r\nforces which act upon them, may change their appearance or position.\r\n\r\nThis brings us at once to the _Forces of Nature_, which are three\r\nin number; viz., Gravity, Cohesion, and Affinity, or Chemical\r\nAttraction. The phenomena connected with the last-named forms the\r\nScience of _Chemistry_. We give these three Forces these names. But\r\nfirst we must see what is Force, for this is very important. Force\r\nis a CAUSE—the cause of Motion or of Rest. This may appear\r\nparadoxical, but a little reflection will prove it. It requires force\r\nto set any object in motion, and this body would never stop unless some\r\nother force or forces prevented its movement beyond a certain point.\r\nForce is therefore the cause of a change of “state” in matter.\r\n\r\nWe have said there are three forces in nature. The first is Gravity,\r\nor the attraction of particles at a distance from each other. We may\r\nsay that Gravity, or Gravitation, is the mutual attraction between\r\ndifferent portions of matter acting at all distances,—the force of\r\nattraction being, of course, in proportion to the mass of the bodies\r\nrespectively. The greatest body is the Earth, so far as our purposes\r\nare concerned. So the attraction of the Earth is _Gravity_, or what we\r\ncall _Weight_.\r\n\r\nWe can easily prove this. We know if we jump from a chair we shall\r\ncome to the floor; and if there were nothing between us and the actual\r\nground sufficient to sustain the force of the attracting power of the\r\nearth, we should fall to the earth’s surface. In a teacup the spoon\r\nwill attract air bubbles, and large air bubbles will attract small\r\nones, till we find a small mass of bubbles formed in the centre of the\r\ncup of tea. Divide this bubble, and the component parts will rush to\r\nthe sides of the cup. This form of attraction is illustrated by the\r\naccompanying diagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nSuppose two balls of equal magnitude, A and B (fig.\r\n14). These being of equal magnitude, attract each other with equal\r\nforce, and will meet, if not opposed, at a point (M) half-way\r\nbetween the two. But they do not meet, because the attraction of the\r\nearth is greater than the attraction they relatively and collectively\r\nexercise towards each other. But if the size of the balls be different,\r\nthe attraction of the greater will be more evident, as shown below,\r\nwhere the points of meeting are indicated respectively (figs. 15 and\r\n16). These experiments will illustrate the phenomena of _falling\r\nbodies_. Gravity is the cause of this, because every object on the\r\nsurface of the earth is very much smaller than the earth itself, and\r\ntherefore all bodies _fall_ towards the centre of the earth. A certain\r\ntime is thus occupied, and we can find the _velocity_ or rapidity of a\r\nfalling body very easily. On the earth a body, if let fall, will pass\r\nthrough a space sixteen feet in the first second; and as the attraction\r\nof the earth still continues and is exercised upon a body already in\r\nrapid motion, this rate of progress must be proportionately increased.\r\nJust as when steam is kept up in an engine running down hill, the\r\nvelocity of the train will rapidly increase as it descends the gradient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 15 and 16.]\r\n\r\nA body falling, then, descends sixteen feet in the first second, and\r\nfor every succeeding second it assumes a greater velocity. The distance\r\nthe body travels has been calculated, and the space it passes through\r\nhas been found to _increase in proportion to the square of the time it\r\ntakes to fall_. For instance, suppose you drop a stone from the top of\r\na cliff to the beach, and it occupies two seconds in falling, if you\r\nmultiply 2 × 2, and the result by sixteen, you will find how high the\r\ncliff is: in this (supposed) case it is (omitting decimals) sixty-four\r\nfeet high. The depth of a well can also be ascertained in the same way,\r\nleaving out the effect of air resistance.\r\n\r\nBut if we go up into the air, the force of gravity will be diminished.\r\nThe attraction will be less, because we are more distant from the\r\ncentre of the earth. This decrease is scarcely, if at all, perceptible,\r\neven on very high mountains, because their size is not great in\r\ncomparison with the mass of the earth’s surface. The rule for this is\r\n_that gravity decreases in proportion to the square of the distance_.\r\nSo that if at a certain distance from the earth’s surface the force of\r\nattraction be 1, if the distance be _doubled_ the attraction will be\r\nonly _one quarter_ as much as before—not one-half.\r\n\r\nGravity has exactly the same influence upon _all_ bodies, and the force\r\nof the attraction is in proportion to the mass. All bodies of equal\r\nmass will fall in the same time in a given distance. Two coins (or a\r\ncoin and a feather _in vacuo_) will fall together. But in the air the\r\nfeather will remain far behind the coin, because nearly all the atoms\r\nof the former are resisted by the air, while in the coin only some\r\nparticles are exposed to the resistance, the _density_ of the latter\r\npreventing the air from reaching more than a few atoms, comparatively\r\nspeaking. The theory of weight and gravitation, and experiments\r\nrelating to the falling of bodies, may be easily demonstrated with\r\nordinary objects that we have at hand. I take a halfpenny and a piece\r\nof paper, which I cut in the shape of the coin, and holding them side\r\nby side, I drop them simultaneously; the halfpenny reaches the ground\r\nsome time before the paper, a result quite in accordance with the laws\r\nof gravitation, as one must bear in mind the presence of air, and the\r\ndifferent resistance it offers to two bodies differing in density. I\r\nnext place the paper disc on the upper surface of the piece of money,\r\nand then drop them simultaneously. The two objects now reach the ground\r\nat the same time, the paper, in contact with the halfpenny, being\r\npreserved from the action of the air. This experiment is so well known\r\nthat we need not further discuss it; but it must be plainly evident\r\nthat it is capable of development in experiments on phenomena relating\r\nto falling bodies.[7] When a body influenced by the action of a force\r\nacts, in its turn, upon another, the latter reacts in an opposite\r\nmanner upon the first, and with the same intensity.\r\n\r\n_The Attraction of Cohesion_ is the attraction of particles of bodies\r\nto each other at very small distances apart. Cohesion has received\r\nvarious names in order to express its various degrees. For instance,\r\nwe say a body is tough or brittle, or soft or hard, according to the\r\ndegrees of cohesion the particles exercise. We know if we break a glass\r\nwe destroy the cohesion; the particles cannot be reunited. Most Liquid\r\nparticles can be united, but not all. Oil will not mix with water.\r\n\r\nThe force of cohesion depends upon heat. Heat expands everything, and\r\nthe cohesion diminishes as temperature increases.\r\n\r\nThere are some objects or substances upon the earth the particles of\r\nwhich adhere much more closely than others, and can only, with very\r\ngreat difficulty, be separated. These are termed _Solids_. There are\r\nother substances whose particles can easily be divided, or their\r\nposition altered. These are called _Fluids_. A third class seem to have\r\nlittle or no cohesion at all. These are termed _Gases_.\r\n\r\nAdhesion is also a form of attraction, and is cohesion existing on the\r\nsurfaces of two bodies. When a fluid adheres to a solid we say the\r\nsolid _is wet_. We turn this natural adhesion to our own purposes in\r\nmany ways,—we whitewash our walls, and paint our houses; we paste our\r\npapers together, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many fluids will hot adhere. Oil and water have\r\nalready been instanced. Mercury will not stick to a glass tube, nor\r\nwill the oiled glass tube retain any water. We can show the attraction\r\nand repulsion in the following manner:—Let one glass tube be dipped\r\ninto water and another into mercury, you will see that the water will\r\nascend slightly at the side, owing to the attraction of the glass,\r\nwhile the mercury will be higher in the centre, for it possesses no\r\nattraction for the glass (fig. 17). If small, or what are termed\r\ncapillary (or hair) tubes, be used (fig. 18), the water will rise up in\r\nthe one tube, while in the other the mercury will remain lower than the\r\nmercury outside the tube. (See _Capillarity_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n_Chemical Attraction_ is the force by which two different bodies unite\r\nto form a new and different body from either. This force will be fully\r\nconsidered in CHEMISTRY, in a future part.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for us to dwell upon the uses of these Forces of Nature.\r\nGravity and Cohesion being left out of our world, we can imagine the\r\nresult. The earth and sun and planets would wander aimlessly about;\r\nwe should float away into space, and everything would fall to pieces,\r\nwhile our bodies would dissolve into their component parts.\r\n\r\n_The Balance and Centre of Gravity._—We have spoken at some length\r\nabout Gravity, and now we must say something respecting that point\r\ncalled the _Centre of Gravity_, and the _Balance_, and upon the latter\r\nwe have a few remarks to make first, for a well-adjusted balance is\r\na most useful thing, and we will show you how to make one, and then\r\nproceed to our illustrations of the Centre of Gravity, and explain it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—Torsion balance, which can easily be\r\nconstructed, capable of weighing a milligram one-tenth of full size.]\r\n\r\nAll those who cultivate experimental science are aware that it is\r\nuseful to unite with theoretical ideas that manual dexterity which is\r\nacquired by the student accustoming himself to practical operations.\r\nOne cannot too strongly urge both chemists and physicists to exercise\r\nthemselves in the construction of the appliances they require, and\r\nalso to modify those already existing, which may be adapted to their\r\nwants. In a large number of cases it is possible to manufacture, at\r\nsmall expense, delicate instruments, capable of rendering the same\r\nservice as the most elaborate apparatus. Important scientific labours\r\nhave often been undertaken by men whose laboratories were most simple,\r\nwho, by means of skill and perseverance, knew how to do great things\r\nwith small resources. A delicate balance, for instance, indispensable\r\nalike to chemist and physicist, can be manufactured at little cost in\r\ndifferent ways. A thin platinum wire and a piece of wood is all that\r\nis needed to make a balance capable of weighing a milligram; and to\r\nmake a very sensitive hydrostatic balance, little is required besides\r\na glass balloon. Fig. 19 represents a small torsion balance of extreme\r\nsimplicity. A thin platinum wire is stretched horizontally through two\r\nstaples, from the wooden supports, A B, which are fixed in a\r\ndeal board. A very thin, delicate lever, C D, cut in wood,\r\nor made with a wisp of straw, is fixed in the centre of the platinum\r\nwire by means of a small clip, which secures it firmly. This lever\r\nis placed in such a manner that it is raised perceptibly out of the\r\nhorizontal line. At D is fixed a paper scale, on which is put\r\nthe weight of a centigram. The lever is lowered to a certain point,\r\nslightly twisting the platinum wire. Near the end of the lever a piece\r\nof wood, F, is fixed, on which is marked the extreme point\r\nof its movements. Ten equi-distant divisions are marked between these\r\ntwo points, which represent the distance traversed by the lever under\r\nthe weight of the milligram. If a smaller weight than a centigram is\r\nplaced on the paper scale the lever falls, and balances itself after\r\na few oscillations. If it falls four divisions, it is evident that the\r\nsubstance weighs four milligrams. Taking a rather thicker platinum\r\nwire, to which a shorter lever must be adapted, one can weigh the\r\ndecigram, and so on. It would be an easy matter, also, to make, on the\r\nsame model, balances for weighing considerable weights. The platinum\r\nwire should be replaced by iron wires of larger diameter, firmly\r\nstretched, and the lever should be made of a piece of very resisting\r\nwood. One can also, by adaptation, find the exact value of the most\r\ntrifling weights. By lengthening a very fine platinum wire several\r\nyards, and adapting a long, slender lever, it will not be impossible to\r\nascertain the tenth of a milligram. In this latter case the balance can\r\nbe set when it is wanted.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 represents Nicholson’s Areometer, which any one may construct\r\nfor himself, and which, as it is here represented, constitutes another\r\nkind of balance. A glass balloon, filled with air, is hermetically\r\nclosed with a cork, through which is passed a cylinder of wood,\r\nsurmounted by a wooden disc, D. The apparatus is terminated at\r\nits lower end by a small tray, C, on which one can put pieces\r\nof lead in variable quantities. It is then plunged into a glass filled\r\nwith water. The pieces of lead on the tray, C, are added by\r\ndegrees, until the stem of the areometer rises almost entirely above\r\nthe level of the water; it is next passed through a ring, which keeps\r\nit in position, and which is fastened to the upper part of the glass by\r\nmeans of four iron wires in the shape of a cross. The stem is divided\r\nin such a way that the space comprised in each division represents the\r\nvolume of a cubic centimetre. Thus arranged, the apparatus constitutes\r\na balance. The object to be weighed is placed on the disc, D,\r\nand the areometer sinks in the water, oscillates, and then remains in\r\nequilibrium. If the stem sinks five divisions, it is evident that the\r\nweight of the object corresponds to that of five cubic centimetres of\r\ndisplaced water, or five grams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—Nicholson’s Areometer, contrived to serve as a\r\nbalance.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, from the preceding examples, that it is\r\nnot impossible to construct a weighing apparatus with ordinary and\r\nvery inexpensive objects. We can, in the same way, show that it is\r\npossible to perform instructive experiments with no appliances at all,\r\nor, at any rate, with common things, such as everyone has at hand.\r\nThe lamented Balard, whose loss science has had recently to deplore,\r\nexcelled in chemical experiments without a laboratory; fragments of\r\nbroken glass or earthenware were used by him for improvising retorts,\r\nbottles and vases for forming precipitates, and carrying on many\r\nimportant operations.\r\n\r\nScheele also operated in like manner; he knew how to make great\r\ndiscoveries with the humblest appliances and most slender resources.\r\nOne cannot too earnestly endeavour to imitate such leaders, both in\r\nteaching others and instructing oneself.\r\n\r\nThe laws relating to the weight of bodies, the centre of gravity, and\r\nstable or unstable equilibrium, may be easily taught and demonstrated\r\nby means of a number of very familiar objects. By putting into the\r\nhands of a child a box of soldiers cut in elder-wood, the end of\r\neach fixed into half a bullet, we provide him with the means of\r\nmaking some easy experiments on the centre of gravity. According to\r\nsome authorities on equilibrium, it is not impossible, with a little\r\npatience and delicacy of manipulation, to keep an egg balanced on\r\none of its ends. This experiment should be performed on a perfectly\r\nhorizontal surface, a marble chimney-piece, for example. If one can\r\nsucceed in keeping the egg up, it is, according to the most elementary\r\nprinciples of physics, because the vertical line of the centre of\r\ngravity passes through the point of contact between the end of the egg\r\nand the surface on which it rests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—Experiment on “centre of gravity.”]\r\n\r\nFig. 21 reproduces a curious experiment in equilibrium, which is\r\nperformed with great facility. Two forks are stuck into a cork, and the\r\ncork is placed on the brim of the neck of a bottle. The forks and the\r\ncork form a whole, of which the centre of gravity is fixed over the\r\npoint of support. We can bend the bottle, empty it even, if it contains\r\nfluid, without the little construction over its mouth being in the\r\nleast disturbed from its balance. The vertical line of the centre of\r\ngravity passes through the point of support, and the forks oscillate\r\nwith the cork, which serves as their support, thus forming a movable\r\nstructure, but much more stable than one is inclined to suppose.\r\nThis curious experiment is often performed by conjurors, who inform\r\ntheir audience, that they will undertake to empty the bottle without\r\ndisturbing the cork. If a woodcock has been served for dinner, or any\r\nother bird with a long beak, take off the head at the extreme end of\r\nthe neck; then split a cork so that you can insert into it the neck of\r\nthe bird, which must be tightly clipped to keep it in place; two forks\r\nare then fixed into the cork, exactly as in the preceding example, and\r\ninto the bottom of the cork a pin is inserted. This little contrivance\r\nis next placed on a piece of money, which has been put on the opening\r\nof the neck of the bottle, and when it is fairly balanced, we give\r\nit a rotatory movement, by pushing one of the forks as rapidly as we\r\nplease, but as much as possible without any jerk (fig. 22). We then see\r\nthe two forks, and the cork surmounted by the woodcock’s head, turning\r\non the slender pivot of a pin. Nothing can be more comical than to\r\nwitness the long beak of the bird turning round and round, successively\r\nfacing all the company assembled round the table, sometimes with a\r\nlittle oscillation, which gives it an almost lifelike appearance.\r\nThis rotatory movement will last some time, and wagers are often laid\r\nas to which of the company the beak will point at when it stops. In\r\nlaboratories, wooden cylinders are often to be seen which will ascend\r\nan inclined plane without any impulsion. This appears very surprising\r\nat first, but astonishment ceases when we perceive that the centre of\r\ngravity is close to the end of the cylinder, because of a piece of\r\nlead, which has been fixed in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—Another experiment on the same subject.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—Automatic puppets.]\r\n\r\nFig. 23 gives a very exact representation of a plaything which was\r\nsold extensively on the Boulevards at Paris at the beginning of the\r\nNew Year. This little contrivance, which has been known for some time,\r\nis one of the most charming applications of the principles relating\r\nto the centre of gravity. With a little skill, any one may construct\r\nit for himself. It consists of two little puppets, which turn round\r\naxles adapted to two parallel tubes containing mercury. When we place\r\nthe little contrivance in the position of fig. 24, the mercury being\r\nat _a_, the two dolls remain motionless, but if we lower the doll\r\nS, so that it stands on the second step (No. 2) of the flight,\r\nas indicated in fig. 25, the mercury descends to _b_ at the other end\r\nof the tube; the centre of gravity is suddenly displaced; the doll\r\nR then accomplishes a rotatory movement, as shown by the arrow\r\nin fig. 25, and finally alights on step No. 3. The same movement is\r\nalso effected by the doll S, and so on, as many times as there\r\nare steps. The dolls may be replaced by a hollow cylinder of cartridge\r\npaper closed at both ends, and containing a marble; the cylinder,\r\nwhen placed vertically on an inclined plane, descends in the same\r\nway as the puppets. The laws of equilibrium and displacement of the\r\ncentre of gravity, are rigorously observed by jugglers, who achieve\r\nmany wonderful feats, generally facilitated by the rotatory motion\r\ngiven to the bodies on which they operate, which brings into play the\r\ncentrifugal force. The juggler who balances on his forehead a slender\r\nrod, on the end of which a plate turns round, would never succeed\r\nin the experiment if the plate did not turn on its axis with great\r\nrapidity. But by quick rotation the centre of gravity is kept near the\r\npoint of support. We need hardly remark, too, that it is the motion of\r\na top that tends to keep it in a vertical position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—First position of the puppets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—Second position of the puppets.]\r\n\r\nMany experiments in mechanical physics may occur to one’s mind. To\r\nconclude the enumeration of those we have collected on the subject,\r\nI will describe the method of lifting a glass bottle full of water\r\nby means of a simple wisp of straw. The straw is bent before being\r\npassed into the bottle of water, so that, when it is lifted, the centre\r\nof gravity is displaced, and brought directly under the point of\r\nsuspension. Fig. 26 shows the method of operation very plainly. It is\r\nwell to have at hand several pieces of straw perfectly intact, and free\r\nfrom cracks, in case the experiment does not succeed with the first\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen how this point we call the centre of gravity acts, we\r\nmay briefly explain it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—Lifting a bottle with a single straw.]\r\n\r\nThe centre of gravity of a body is that point in which the sum of the\r\nforces of gravity, acting upon all the particles, may be said to be\r\nunited. We know the attraction of the earth causes bodies to have a\r\nproperty we call _Weight_. This property of weight presses upon every\r\nparticle of the body, and acts upon them as parallel forces. For if a\r\nstone be broken all the portions will equal the weight of the stone;\r\nand if some of them be suspended, it will be seen that they hang\r\nparallel to each other, so we may call these weights parallel forces\r\nunited in the whole stone, and equal to a single resultant. Now, to\r\nfind the centre of gravity, we must suspend the body, and it will hang\r\nin a certain direction. Draw a line from the point of suspension, and\r\nsuspend the body again: a line drawn from that point of suspension will\r\npass through the same place as the former line did, and so on. That\r\npoint is the centre of gravity of that suspended body. If the form of\r\nit be regular, like a ball or cylinder, the centre of gravity is the\r\nsame as the mathematically central point. In such forms as pyramids\r\nit will be found near the largest mass; viz., at the bases, about\r\none-fourth of the distance between the apex and the centre of gravity\r\nof the base.\r\n\r\nWhen the centre of gravity of any body is supported, that body cannot\r\nfall. So the well-known leaning towers are perfectly safe, because\r\ntheir lines of direction fall within the bases. The centre of gravity\r\nis in the centre of the leaning figure. The line of direction drawn\r\nvertically from that point falls within the base; but if the tower were\r\nbuilt up higher, so that the centre of gravity were higher, then the\r\nstructure would fall, because the line of direction would fall without\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nWe see that animals (and men) are continually altering the position of\r\nthe centre of gravity; for if a man bears a load he will lean forward,\r\nand if he takes up a can of water in one hand he will extend the other\r\nto preserve his balance or equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—Balancing a weight on a nail and key.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment shown in the accompanying illustration is apparently\r\nvery difficult, but it will be found easy enough in practice if\r\nthe hand be steady. Take a key, and by means of a crooked nail, or\r\n“holdfast,” attach it to a bar of wood by a string tied tightly round\r\nthe bar, as in the picture. To the other extremity of the bar attach\r\na weight, and then drive a large-headed nail into the table. It will\r\nbe found that the key will balance, and even move upon the head of the\r\nnail, without falling. The weight is under the table, and the centre of\r\ngravity is exactly beneath the point of suspension.\r\n\r\nAnother simple experiment may prove amusing. Into a piece of wood\r\ninsert the points of two knives, and at the centre of the end of the\r\nbar insert a needle between the knife handles. The wood and the knives\r\nmay then be balanced on another needle fixed in a cork at A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—Another experiment.]\r\n\r\nWe may conclude this chapter by summing up in a few words what the\r\nCentre of Gravity is. We can define it as “that point in a body upon\r\nwhich the body, acted on solely by the force of gravity, will balance\r\nitself in all positions.” Such a point exists in every body, and\r\nequally in a number of bodies fastened tightly together. The Centre of\r\nGravity has by some writers been denominated the _Centre of Parallel\r\nForces_, or the _Centre of Magnitude_, but the Centre of Gravity is the\r\nmost usual and best understood term.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] M. A. G. has written us an interesting letter on the subject of\r\nsimilar experiments, which we here transcribe:—\r\n\r\n“When a siphon of seltzer water has been opened some little time, and\r\nthe equilibrium of tension is nearly established between the escaped\r\ngas and the dissolved gas, a vertical stream of bubbles is seen to rise\r\nfrom the bottom of the apparatus, which present a very clear example\r\nof the law of ascension of bubbles; that is to say (putting out of the\r\nquestion the expansion of the bubbles in their passage upwards), it\r\nis an inverse representation of the law of gravity affecting falling\r\nbodies. The bubbles, in fact, detach themselves from their starting\r\npoint with perfect regularity; and as the interval varies in one\r\nfile from another, we have before us a multiplied representation of\r\nthat terrible law which Attwood’s machine made such a bugbear to the\r\ncommercial world. I believe it is possible, by counting the number\r\nof bubbles that detach themselves in a second, in each file, and the\r\nnumber which the whole stream contains at a given instant, to carry\r\nthe verification further; but I must confess that I have not done so\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n SOME PROPERTIES OF SOLID BODIES—INERTIA—MOTION—FRICTION—THE\r\n PENDULUM—EQUILIBRIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have followed us through the preceding pages have now, we\r\nhope, some ideas upon Gravity and the Forces of Nature. In speaking\r\nof Forces we said “Force was a cause of Motion.” Let us now consider\r\nInertia, and Motion with its accompanying opponent, Friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.—Shock communicated by elasticity.]\r\n\r\nINERTIA is the passiveness of Matter. This perfect\r\nindifference to either rest or motion makes the great distinction\r\nbetween living and lifeless matter. Inertia, or _Vis Inertia_, is this\r\npassiveness. Now, to overcome this indifference we must use force,\r\nand when we have applied force to matter we set it in motion; that\r\nis, we move it. When we move it we find a certain resistance which\r\nis always proportionate to the force applied. In mechanics this is\r\ntermed _Action_, and _Reaction_, which are always equal forces acting\r\nin opposite directions. This is Newton’s law, and may be explained by\r\na “weight” on a table, which presses against the table with the same\r\nforce with which the table presses against the “weight”; or when you\r\nstrike a ball, it strikes the hand with the same force.\r\n\r\nWe can communicate motion by elasticity. For instance, if we place a\r\nnumber of coins upon a table touching each other and in a straight\r\nline, and strike the last coin of the line by pushing another sharply\r\nagainst it, the piece at the opposite extremity will slip out of its\r\nplace from the effect of the shock transmitted by the coin at the other\r\nend (fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.—Experiment to illustrate inertia.]\r\n\r\nWhen two forces act upon a body at the same time, it takes a direction\r\nintermediate. This is known as the resultant. The enormous forces\r\nexercised by the heavenly bodies will be treated of later. We will\r\nfirst consider _Inertia_.\r\n\r\nThere are several experiments relating to the subject of Inertia which\r\nmay be performed. I once witnessed one quite accidentally when taking a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.—Another experiment on the same subject.]\r\n\r\nI was one day passing the Observatory at Paris, when I noticed a number\r\nof people collected round a professor, who after executing several\r\njuggling tricks, proceeded to perform the curious experiment I am about\r\nto describe. He took a broomstick and placed it horizontally, passing\r\nthe ends through two paper rings. He then asked two children to hold\r\nthe paper rings by means of two razors, so that the rings rested on\r\nthe blade. This done, the operator took a stout stick, and, with all\r\nhis strength, struck the broomstick in the centre; it was broken into\r\nshivers, but the paper rings were not torn in the least, or even cut\r\nby the razors! One of my friends, M. M——, a painter, showed me how to\r\nperform this experiment as represented in the illustration (fig. 30).\r\nA needle is fixed at each end of the broomstick, and these needles\r\nare made to rest on two glasses, placed on chairs; the needles alone\r\nmust be in contact with the glasses. If the broomstick is then struck\r\nviolently with another stout stick, the former will be broken, but\r\nthe glasses will remain intact. The experiment answers all the better\r\nthe more energetic the action. It is explained by the resistance of\r\ninertia in the broomstick. The shock suddenly given, the impulse\r\nhas not time to pass on from the particles directly affected to the\r\nadjacent particles; the former separate before the movement can be\r\ntransmitted to the glasses serving as supports.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.—Extracting a “man” from a pile of draughts\r\nwithout overturning the pile.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment represented in fig. 31 is of the same nature. A wooden\r\nball is suspended from the ceiling by a rather slender thread, and a\r\nsimilar thread is attached to the lower end of the ball. If the lower\r\nthread is pulled forcibly it will break, as shown in the illustration;\r\nthe movement communicated to it has not time to pass into the ball; if,\r\non the contrary, it is pulled very gradually and without any shock,\r\nthe upper thread instead will break, because in this case it supports\r\nthe weight of the ball. Motion is not imparted simultaneously to all\r\nparts of a body, but only to the particles first exposed to a blow, for\r\ninstance. One might multiply examples of this. If a bullet be shot from\r\na gun, it will make a round hole in a piece of wood or glass, whilst\r\nif thrown by the hand,—that is to say, with much less force,— it will\r\nshiver the wood or the pane of glass to pieces. When the celerity of\r\nthe motive force is very great, the particles directly affected are\r\ndisturbed so quickly that they separate from the adjacent particles\r\nbefore there is time for the movement to be communicated to the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, for the same reason, to extract from a pile of money a\r\npiece placed in the middle of the pile without overturning the others.\r\nIt suffices to move them forcibly and quickly with a flat wooden ruler.\r\nThe experiment succeeds very well also if performed with draughtsmen\r\npiled up on the draught-board (fig. 32).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.—Calling out a sixpence from the glass.]\r\n\r\nFig. 33 represents another experiment which belongs to the laws of\r\nresisting force. A sixpence is placed on a table covered with a cloth\r\nor napkin. It is covered with a glass, turned over so that its brim\r\nrests on two penny pieces. The problem to be solved is how to extract\r\nthe sixpence from underneath the glass without touching it, or slipping\r\nanything beneath it. To do this it is necessary to scratch the cloth\r\nwith the nail of the forefinger; the elasticity of the material\r\ncommunicates the movement to the sixpence, which slowly moves in the\r\ndirection of the finger, until it finally comes out completely from\r\nbeneath the glass.\r\n\r\nWe may give another experiment concerning Inertia. Take a strip of\r\npaper, and upon it place a coin, on a marble chimney-piece, as in\r\nthe illustration. If, holding the paper in the left hand, you strike\r\nit rapidly and forcibly, you will be enabled to draw away the paper\r\nwithout causing the coin (say a five-shilling-piece) to fall down (fig.\r\n34).\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to draw away a napkin laid as a tablecloth\r\nfor one person’s dinner, without disturbing the various articles\r\nlaid upon it. A quick motion is all that is necessary, keeping the\r\nnapkin tightly extended by the hands at the same time. This latter\r\nexperiment, however, is not recommended to boys home for the holidays,\r\nas they may unwillingly practise a feat analogous to that executed by\r\nHumpty-Dumpty, and find equal difficulty to match the pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.—Drawing a slip of paper from beneath a coin.]\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the term _Motion_. A body is said to be in motion\r\nwhen it changes its position in relation to surrounding objects. To\r\nperceive motion the surrounding objects must be relatively at rest,\r\nfor if they all hurried along at the same rate no motion would be\r\nperceptible. This is evident, for when we stand still trees and houses\r\nappear stationary, as do we ourselves, but we know we all are rushing\r\nround with the earth, though our _relative_ positions are unchanged.\r\nHence there is no _absolute_ rest.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes of motion?—Gravity is one. The influence of\r\nheat, which is itself caused by the motion of atoms, the effects\r\nof electricity, etc., and finally, the power of force in men or\r\nanimals—any of these causes will produce motion. But a body at rest\r\ncannot put itself in motion, nor can a body in motion stop itself, or\r\nchange its condition of motion.\r\n\r\nBut you may say a body will stop itself. Your ball on the ground, or\r\neven upon ice, will eventually come to a stop. We fire a bullet, and it\r\nwill stop in time. We reply it does not stop of itself. The resistance\r\nof the Air and Friction tend to bring the body in motion to a state of\r\nrest. In the case of a bullet gravity brings it down.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to insist upon the resistance offered by the air\r\neven when it is not rushing violently past to fill up a vacuum beyond\r\nus, and called a breeze, or high wind. But we may say something of\r\n_Friction_.\r\n\r\nFriction is derived from the Latin _frico_, to rub, and expresses the\r\nresistance to motion which arises from uneven surfaces. It is a passive\r\nresistance, and depends upon the force which keeps the bodies together.\r\nThus a train running upon a smooth iron rail would never be able to\r\nproceed but for friction, which gives the necessary purchase or grip to\r\nthe wheel and rail in contact.\r\n\r\nNo surface is perfectly smooth, for we must push a body upon the\r\nsmoothest surface we possess. Friction tends to resist motion always,\r\nand is the cause of a great loss of power in mechanics, though it is\r\nemployed to stop motion by certain appliances, such as “brakes” and\r\n“drags,” for sliding friction is greater than rolling friction. But\r\nwithout friction most structures would fall to pieces, and all forward\r\nmotion would cease. So though it is an inconvenient force to overcome,\r\nwe could not do without it.\r\n\r\nIf a body is set in motion, we see that the tendency of it is to go on\r\nfor ever. Such, indeed, is the case with the stars; but so long as we\r\nare within the influence of the earth’s attraction, we cannot expect\r\nsuch a result. We know now what motion is; we must also, to understand\r\nit perfectly, consider its direction and its velocity.\r\n\r\nThe line which indicates the way from the starting point to the end\r\nis the _direction_ of the object in motion, and the rate it moves at\r\nits _velocity_. The latter is calculated at so many miles an hour,\r\nas a train; or so many feet in a second if the object be a shot, or\r\nother very rapidly-moving body. In equal velocity the same distance\r\nis traversed in the same time; and so if a train run a mile in a\r\nminute, we know it will travel sixty miles in an hour, and is therefore\r\nduring that minute going at _the rate_ of sixty miles an hour. We\r\nhave already spoken of the velocity of a stone falling from a cliff\r\nas sixteen feet in a second, and a stone thrown into the air to rise\r\nsixteen feet will be a second in going up, and a second in descending.\r\nBut the velocity will be accelerated in the descent after the first\r\nsecond of time, and retarded in the upward cast by gravity. So we have\r\ntwo terms—_accelerated_ and _retarded_ velocity—used to express an\r\nincreased or decreased force of attraction.\r\n\r\nPerpetual motion has often been sought, but never discovered, nor\r\nwill it ever be till the elixir of life has been found. It is quite\r\nimpossible to construct any machine that will work without friction;\r\nif any work be done energy will be expended and transformed into other\r\nenergy, so the total must be diminished by so much as was employed to\r\ntransform the remainder. No body can give unlimited work, therefore\r\nthe perpetual motion theory is untenable and impossible.\r\n\r\nThe _pendulum_ is considered the nearest approach to perpetual motion.\r\nThis is so well known that no description is needed, but we may say\r\na few words concerning it. By the diagram, we see that if we lift\r\nthe ball to _b_, and let it fall, it will descend to _l_, and pass\r\nit to _a_ opposite, nearly as far from _l_ as _b_ is from it. So the\r\noscillations will continue, each beat being less and less, till rest is\r\nreached by the action of gravity (page 23). Were it not for friction\r\nand the pressure of the air, the oscillations would continue for ever;\r\nas it is, it declines by shorter swings till it remains in equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.—The pendulum.]\r\n\r\nThe seconds’ pendulum oscillates sixty times an hour, and must be of a\r\ncertain length in certain places. In London it is 39·1393 inches, and\r\nfurnishes a certain standard of length, and by an Act of Parliament the\r\nyard is divided into 36 parts, and 39·1393 such parts make the seconds’\r\npendulum in the latitude of London (_in vacuo_) in a temperature of 62°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.—Centrifugal Force.]\r\n\r\nBut the same pendulum will not perform the same number of oscillations\r\nin one minute in all parts of the globe. At the equator they will\r\nbe less, and at the pole more. Thus it was discovered that, as the\r\nmovements of the pendulum are dependent upon the force of gravity,\r\nand as this force decreases the farther we get from the centre of the\r\nearth, the equator must be farther from the earth’s centre than the\r\npoles, and therefore the poles must be depressed. The decline of the\r\npendulum at the equator is also, in a measure, due to Centrifugal Force.\r\n\r\n_Centrifugal Force_, which means “flying from the centre,” is the force\r\nwhich causes an object to describe a circle with uniform velocity, and\r\nfly away from the centre; the force that counteracts it is called the\r\n_centripetal_ force. A very simple experiment will illustrate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.—Another illustration of centrifugal force.]\r\n\r\nTo represent its action, we shall have recourse to an ordinary glass\r\ntumbler placed on a round piece of cardboard, held firmly in place by\r\ncords. Some water is poured in the glass, and we then show that it can\r\nbe swung to and fro and round without the water being spilt, even when\r\nthe glass is upside down (fig. 36).\r\n\r\nAnother experiment on the same subject is as shown in the above\r\nillustration, by which a napkin ring can be kept in revolution around\r\nthe forefinger, and by a continued force the ring may be even held\r\nsuspended at the tip of the finger, apparently in the air, without\r\nsupport (fig. 37).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The experiment we have just described is a very old one. M. V.\r\nSircoulon has told us that it was described at length in the works of\r\nRabelais. The following remarks are in “Pantagruel,” book II., chap.\r\nxvii.\r\n\r\n“Panuræ then took two glasses of the same size, filled them with water,\r\nand put one on one stool, and the other on another, about five feet\r\napart, and placed the staff of a javelin about five-and-a-half feet\r\nlong across, so that the ends of the staff just touched the brim of\r\nthe glasses. That done, he took a stout piece of wood, and said to the\r\nothers: “Gentlemen, this is how we shall conquer our enemies; for in\r\nthe same way that I shall break this staff between these two glasses,\r\nwithout the glasses being broken or injured, or spilling a single drop\r\nof water, so shall we break the head of our Dipsodes, without any\r\ninjury to ourselves, and without getting wounded. But that you may not\r\nthink there is magic in it, you, Eusthenes, strike with this stick as\r\nhard as you can in the centre.” This Eusthenes did, and the staff broke\r\nin two pieces, without a drop of water being spilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n GASES AND LIQUIDS—PRESSURE OF THE AIR—EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have more than once referred to the pressure of the air which exerts\r\na great influence upon bodies in motion, but a few experiments will\r\nmake this more obvious, and clearly demonstrate the fact. We have also\r\ntold you some of the properties of Solids, such as Weight, Inertia,\r\nFriction, and Resistance, or Strength. Solids also, as we have seen,\r\noccupy space, and cannot be readily compressed, nor bent to other\r\nshapes. Now the subject of the Pressure of the Air leads us to the\r\nother forms of Matter; namely, Gases and Liquids, which will be found\r\nvery interesting to study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.—Blowing an egg from one glass to another.]\r\n\r\nThe force of air can very soon be shown as acting with considerable\r\npressure upon an egg in a glass. By blowing in a claret glass\r\ncontaining a hard-boiled egg, it is possible to cause the egg to\r\njump out of the glass; and with practice and strength of lungs it\r\nis not impossible to make it pass from one glass to another, as per\r\nillustration (fig. 38).\r\n\r\nThe force of heated air ascending can also be ascertained by cutting up\r\na card into a spiral, and holding it above the flame of a lamp (fig.\r\n39). The spiral, if lightly poised, will turn round rapidly.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to a few experiments with the air, which is composed\r\nin two gases, Oxygen and Nitrogen, of which we shall hear more when we\r\ncome to CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.—Movement of heated air.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.—Pressure of the air.]\r\n\r\nIt is not intended here to prosecute researches, but rather to sketch\r\na programme for instruction, based on amusing experiments in Physics,\r\nperformed without apparatus. The greater part of these experiments\r\nare probably well known, and we desire to say that we merely claim to\r\nhave collected and arranged them for our descriptions. We must also\r\nadd that we have performed and verified these experiments; the reader,\r\ntherefore, can attempt them with every certainty of success. We will\r\nsuppose that we are addressing a young auditory, and commence our\r\ncourse of Physics with some facts relating to the pressure of air. A\r\nwine glass, a plate, and water, will serve for our first experiments.\r\nPour some water on the plate, light a piece of paper resting on a cork,\r\nand cover the flame with the glass which I turn upside down (fig. 40).\r\nWhat follows?—The water rises in the glass. Why?—Because the burning\r\nof the paper having absorbed a part of the oxygen, and the volume\r\nof confined gas being diminished, the pressure of the outer air has\r\ndriven back the fluid. I next fill a goblet with water up to the brim,\r\nand cover it with a sheet of paper which touches both the edge of the\r\nglass and the surface of the water. I turn the glass upside down, and\r\nthe sheet of paper prevents the water running out, because it is held\r\nin place by atmospheric pressure (fig. 41). It sometimes happens that\r\nthis experiment does not succeed till after a few attempts on the part\r\nof the operator; thus it is prudent to turn the glass over a basin, so\r\nthat, in case of failure, the water is not spilt. Having obtained a\r\nvase and a bottle, both quite full of water, take the bottle, holding\r\nit round the neck so that the thumb can be used as a stopper, then turn\r\nit upside down, and pass the neck into the water in the vase. Remove\r\nyour thumb, or stopper, keeping the bottle in a vertical position, and\r\nyou will see that the water it contains does not escape, but remains in\r\nsuspension. It is atmospheric pressure which produces this phenomenon.\r\nIf, instead of water, we put milk in the bottle, or some other fluid\r\ndenser than water, we shall see that the milk also remains suspended\r\nin the bottle, only there is a movement of the fluid in the neck of\r\nthe bottle, and on careful examination we perceive very plainly that\r\nthe milk descends to the bottom of the vase, and the water rises into\r\nthe bottle. Here, again, it is atmospheric pressure which maintains\r\nthe fluid in the bottle, but the milk descends, because fluids are\r\nsuperposed according to their order of density, and the densest liquid\r\nfalls to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThis can be verified by means of the _phial of the four elements_,\r\nwhich is a plain, long, and narrow bottle, containing equal volumes of\r\nmetallic mercury, salt water, alcohol, and oil. These four liquids will\r\nlie one on the top of the other without ever mixing, even if shaken.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment as to the pressure of the air may be made (fig. 42).\r\nTake a penny and press it against some oaken bookcase or press, rub the\r\ncoin against the wood for a few seconds, then press it, and withdraw\r\nthe fingers. The coin will continue to adhere to the wood. The reason\r\nof this is, because by the rubbing and the pressure you have dispersed\r\nthe film of air which was between the penny and the wood, and under\r\nthose conditions the pressure of the atmospheric air was sufficient to\r\nkeep the penny in its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.—Pressure of the air.]\r\n\r\nOr, again, let us now add a water-bottle and a hard-boiled egg to\r\nour appliances; we will make use of the air-pump, and easily perform\r\nanother experiment. I light a piece of paper, and let it burn, plunging\r\nit into a water-bottle full of air. When the paper has been burning\r\na few seconds I close the opening of the water-bottle by means of a\r\nhard-boiled egg, which I have previously divested of its shell, so that\r\nit forms a hermetic stopper. The burning of the paper has now caused a\r\nvacuum of air in the bottle, and the egg is gradually thrust in by the\r\natmospheric pressure outside. Fig. 43 exhibits it slowly lengthening\r\nand stretching out as it passes through the aperture; then it is\r\nsuddenly thrust completely into the bottle with a little explosive\r\nsound, like that produced by striking a paper bag expanded with air.\r\nThis is atmospheric pressure demonstrated in the clearest manner, and\r\nat little cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.—Coin adhering by pressure of air.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to pursue a little further the experiments relating\r\nto atmospheric pressure, it will be easy enough to add to the\r\nbefore-mentioned appliances a closed glass-tube and some mercury, and\r\none will then have the necessary elements for performing Torricelli’s\r\nand Pascal’s experiments, and explaining the theory of the barometer\r\n(page 52).\r\n\r\nAn amusing toy, well-known to schoolboys, called the “sucker,” may also\r\nbe made the object of many dissertations on the vacuum and the pressure\r\nof air. It is composed of a round piece of soft leather, to the centre\r\nof which is attached a small cord. This leather is placed on the\r\nground and pressed under foot, and when the cord is pulled it forms a\r\ncupping-glass, and is only separated with difficulty from the pavement.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric air, in common with other gases, has a tendency to fill\r\nany space into which it may enter. The mutual attraction of particles\r\nof air is _nil_; on the contrary, they appear to have a tendency to\r\nfly away from each other; this property is called “repulsion.” Air\r\nalso possesses an expansive property—a tendency to press against all\r\nthe sides of any vessel in which it may be enclosed. Of course the\r\nlarger the vessel containing a given quantity of air, the less actual\r\npressure it will exert on the sides of the vessel. The elasticity of\r\nair therefore decreases with increasing expansion, but it gains in\r\nelasticity or force when compressed.\r\n\r\nThere is a law in Physics which expresses the relation between\r\nexpansion and elasticity of gases, which may be said to be as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe elasticity (of a gas) is in inverse ratio to the space it occupies,\r\nand therefore by compressing air into a small space we can obtain a\r\ngreat force, as in the air-gun and the pop-gun of our youthful days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.—Hard boiled egg, divested of its shell, passing\r\nthrough the neck of a glass bottle, under the influence of atmospheric\r\npressure.]\r\n\r\nIn the cut below we can illustrate the principle of the pop-gun. The\r\nchamber full of air is closed by a cork and by an air-tight piston\r\n(S) at _p_ and _p_. When the piston is pushed into the chamber\r\nthe air is compressed between it and the stopper, which at length flies\r\nout forcibly with a loud report\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.—The principle of the pop-gun.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the tendency of air particles is to fly away from\r\neach other, and were it not for the earth’s attraction the air might be\r\ndispersed. The height of the atmosphere has been variously estimated\r\nfrom a height of 45 miles to 212 miles in an attenuated form; but\r\nperhaps 100 miles high would be a fair estimate of the height to which\r\nour atmosphere extends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.—Weighing the air.]\r\n\r\nThe pressure of such an enormous body of gas is very great. It has\r\nbeen estimated that this pressure on the average human body amounts\r\nto fourteen tons, but being balanced by elastic fluids in the body,\r\nthe inconvenience is not felt. The _Weight_ of Air can easily be\r\nascertained, though till the middle of the seventeenth century the\r\nair was believed to be without weight. The accompanying illustration\r\nwill prove the weight of air. Take an ordinary balance; and suspend\r\nto one side a glass globe fitted with a stop-cock. From this globe\r\nextract the air by means of the air-pump, and weigh it. When the exact\r\nweight is ascertained turn the stop-cock, the air will rush in, and the\r\nglobe will then pull down the balance, thus proving that air possesses\r\nweight. The experiments of Torricelli and Otto von Guerike, however,\r\ndemonstrated that the air has weight and great pressure. Torricelli\r\npractically invented the barometer, but Otto von Guerike, by the cups\r\nknown as _Magdeburg Hemispheres_, proved the pressure of the outward\r\nair. This apparatus is well known, and consists of two hollow copper\r\nhemispheres which fit very closely. By means of the air-pump which he\r\ninvented in 1650, Otto von Guerike exhausted the air from the closed\r\nhemispheres. So long as air remained in them, there was no great\r\ndifficulty in separating them; but when it had been finally exhausted,\r\nthe pressure of the surrounding atmosphere was so great that the hollow\r\nspheres could not be dragged asunder even by horses harnessed to rings\r\nwhich had been inserted in the globes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.—Magdeburg Hemispheres.]\r\n\r\nThe _Air-Pump_ is a very useful machine, and we will now briefly\r\nexplain its action. The inventor was, as remarked above, Otto von\r\nGuerike, of Magdeburg. The pump consists of a cylinder and piston and\r\nrod, with two valves opening upwards—one valve being in the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, the other in the piston. This pump is attached by a tube\r\nto a plate with a hole in it, one extremity of the tube being fixed in\r\nthe centre of the plate, and the other at the valve at the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder. A glass shade, called the _receiver_, is placed on the\r\ntop of the plate, and of course this shade will be full of air (fig.\r\n47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.—The air-pump.]\r\n\r\nWhen the receiver is in position, we begin to work the pump. We have\r\nsaid there are two valves. So when the piston is drawn up, the cylinder\r\nwould be quite empty did not the valve at the bottom, opening upwards,\r\nadmit some air from the glass shade through the tube to enter the\r\ncylinder. Now the lower part of the cylinder is full of air drawn from\r\nthe glass shade. When we press the piston down again, we press against\r\nthe air in it, which, being compressed, tries to escape. It cannot go\r\nback, because the valve at the bottom of the cylinder won’t open, so\r\nit escapes by the valve in the piston, and goes away. Thus a certain\r\namount of air is got rid of at each stroke of the piston. Two cylinders\r\nand pistons can be used, and so by means of cog-wheels, etc., the air\r\nmay be rapidly exhausted from the receiver. Many experiments are made\r\nwith the assistance of the air-pump and receiver, though the air is\r\nnever _entirely_ exhausted from the glass.\r\n\r\nThe “Sprengel” air-pump is used to create an almost perfect vacuum,\r\nby putting a vessel to be exhausted in connection with the vacuum at\r\nthe top of a tube of mercury thirty inches high. Some air will bubble\r\nout, and the mercury will fall. By filling up again and repeating the\r\nprocess, the air vessel will in time be completely exhausted. This\r\nis done by Mr. Sprengel’s pump, and a practically perfect vacuum is\r\nobtained, like the _Torricellian_ vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe “Torricellian vacuum” is the empty space above the column of\r\nmercury in the barometer which we will proceed to describe. Air has a\r\ncertain weight or pressure which is sufficient to raise a column of\r\nmercury thirty inches. We will prove this by illustration. Take a bent\r\ntube and fill it with mercury; the liquid will stand equally high in\r\nboth arms, in consequence of the ratio of equilibrium in fluids, of\r\nwhich we shall read more when we come to consider Water. So the two\r\ncolumns of mercury are in equilibrium. (See A.) Now stop the\r\narm a with a cork, and take out half the mercury. It will remain in one\r\narm only. Remove the cork, and the fluid will fall in both arms, and\r\nremain in equilibrio. If a long bent glass tube be used, the arms being\r\nthirty-six inches high, the mercury will fall to a point _c_, which\r\nmeasures 29·9 inches from the bottom. If the tube be a square inch\r\nin bore, we have 29·9 cubic inches of mercury, weighing 14⅘ lbs.,\r\nbalancing a column of air one square inch thick and as high as the\r\natmosphere. So the mercury and the column of air must weigh the same.\r\nThus every square inch on the earth supports a weight of (nearly) 15\r\nlbs (figs. 48 and 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.—Air Pressure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.—The Barometer.]\r\n\r\nThe barometer invented by Pascal, working on the investigations of\r\nTorricelli, is a very simple and useful instrument. Fill a tube with\r\nmercury from which all moisture has been expelled, and turn it over\r\nin a dish of mercury; the mercury will rise to a certain height (30\r\ninches), and no higher in vacuo. When the pressure of the air increases\r\nthe mercury rises a little, and falls when the pressure is removed. Air\r\ncharged with aqueous vapour is lighter than dry air, so a fall in the\r\nmercury indicates a certain amount of water-vapour in the air, which\r\nmay condense and become rain. The action of mercury is therefore used\r\nas a weather-glass, by which an index-point shows the movements of the\r\nfluid, by means of a wheel over which a thread passes, sustaining a\r\nfloat and a counterpoise. When the mercury rises the float goes up,\r\nand the weight falls, and turns the wheel by means of the thread. The\r\nwheel having a pointer on the dial tells us how the mercury moves. This\r\n_weather-glass_ is the usual _syphon barometer_ with the float on the\r\nsurface and a weight (fig. 50).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.—Syphon barometer.]\r\n\r\nThe Syphon Barometer is a bent tube like the one already shown, with\r\none limb much shorter than the other.\r\n\r\nThe Aneroid Barometer, so called because it is “without moisture,”\r\nis now in common use. In these instruments the atmospheric pressure\r\nis held in equilibrium by an elastic metal spring or tube. A metal\r\nbox, or tube, is freed from air, and then hermetically sealed. This\r\nbox has a flexible side, the elasticity of which, and the pressure of\r\nthe air on it, keep each other in equilibrium. Upon this elastic side\r\nthe short arm of a lever is pressed, while the longer arm works an\r\nindex-point, as in the circular barometer. When pressure increases the\r\nelastic box “gives”; when pressure diminishes it returns to its former\r\nplace, and the index moves in the opposite direction. It is necessary\r\nto compare and “set” the aneroid with the mercurial barometer to ensure\r\ncorrectness. A curved tube is sometimes used, which coils and uncoils\r\nlike a spring, according to the pressure on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.—The Water Barometer.]\r\n\r\nThere are other barometers, such as the Water Barometer, which can\r\nbe fixed against the side of a house, and if the water be coloured,\r\nit will prove a useful indicator. As the name indicates, water is\r\nused instead of mercury, but as the latter is thirteen-and-half times\r\nheavier than water, a much longer tube is necessary; viz., one about\r\nthirty-five feet in length. The construction is easy enough. A leaden\r\npipe can be fixed against the house; on the top is a funnel furnished\r\nwith a stop-cock, and placed in a vase of water. The lower part of the\r\ntube is bent, and a glass cylinder attached, with another stop-cock—the\r\nglass being about three feet long, and graduated. Fill the tube with\r\nwater, shut the upper stop-cock, and open the lower one. The vacuum\r\nwill be formed in the top of the tube, and the barometer will act on a\r\nlarger scale than the mercury.\r\n\r\nThe Glycerine Barometer, invented by Mr. Jordan, and in use at the\r\n_Times_ office, registers as more than one inch movements which on the\r\nmercurial thermometer are only one-tenth of an inch, and so are very\r\ndistinctly visible. The specific gravity of pure glycerine is less\r\nthan one-tenth that of mercury, so the mean height of the glycerine\r\ncolumn is twenty-seven feet at sea level. The glycerine has, however,\r\na tendency to absorb moisture from the air, but Mr. Jordan, by putting\r\nsome petroleum oil upon the glycerine, neutralized that tendency, and\r\nthe atmospheric pressure remains the same. A full description of this\r\ninstrument was given in the _Times_ of 25th October, 1880.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.—The principle of the diving-bell.]\r\n\r\nThe uses of the barometer are various. It is employed to calculate the\r\nheights of mountains; for if a barometer at sea level stand at 30\",\r\nit will be lower on a mountain top, because the amount of air at an\r\nelevation of ten thousand feet is less than at the level of the sea,\r\nand consequently exercises less pressure, and the mercury descends.\r\n[The pressure is on the bulb of mercury at the bottom, not on the\r\n_top_, remember.]\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the air at the tops of mountains sometimes decreases\r\nvery much, and it is not sufficiently dense for perfect respiration, as\r\nmany people find. Some climbers suffer from bleeding at the nose, etc.,\r\nat great altitudes. This is occasioned by the action of the heart,\r\nwhich pumps with great force, and the outward pressure upon the little\r\nveins being so much less than usual, they give way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.—Diver under water.]\r\n\r\nMany important instruments depend upon atmospheric pressure. The\r\nmost important of these is the pump, which will carry us to the\r\nconsideration of water and FLUIDS generally. The fire-engine\r\nis another example, but we will now proceed to explain the diving-bell\r\nalready referred to.\r\n\r\nFig. 52 represents the experiment of the diving-bell, which is so\r\nsimple, and is explained below. It belongs to the same category of\r\nexperiments as those relating to the pressure of air and compression of\r\ngas. Two or three flies have been introduced into the glass, and they\r\nprove by their buzzing about that they are quite at their ease in the\r\nrather confined space.\r\n\r\nThe DIVING-BELL in a crude form appears to have been used as\r\nearly as 1538. It was used by two Greeks in the presence of the Emperor\r\nCharles V., and numerous spectators. In the year 1720 Doctor Halley\r\nimproved the diving-bell, which was a wooden box or chamber open at\r\nthe bottom. Air casks were used to keep the inmate supplied with air.\r\nThe modern diving-bell was used by Smeaton in 1788, and was made of\r\ncast iron. It sinks by its own weight. The pressure of the air inside\r\nis sufficient to keep the water out. Air being easily compressed, it\r\nis always pumped in to keep the hollow iron “bell” full, and to supply\r\nthe workmen. There are inventions now in use by which the diver carries\r\na supply of air with him on his back, and by turning a tap can supply\r\nhimself for a long time at a distance from the place of descent,\r\nand thus is able to dispense with the air-tube from the boat at the\r\nsurface. This apparatus was exhibited at the Crystal Palace some years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.—The Hand Fire-Engine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUMP.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the case of the Water Barometer that the pressure of\r\nthe air will sustain a column of water about thirty feet high. So the\r\ndistance between the lower valve and the reservoir or cistern must\r\nnot be more than thirty-two feet, practically the distance is about\r\ntwenty-five feet in pumps.\r\n\r\nWe can see by the illustration that the working is much the same as in\r\nthe air-pump. The suction pipe B is closed by the valve C, the cylinder\r\nD and spout E are above, the piston rod F lifts the air-tight piston\r\nin which is a valve H. When the piston is raised the valve C opens and\r\nadmits the water into the cylinder. When the piston is depressed the\r\nvalve C is closed, the water already in forces H open, and passing\r\nthrough the piston, reaches the cylinder and the spout (fig. 55).\r\n\r\nThe hand fire-engine depends upon the action of compressed air, which\r\nis so compressed by pumping water into the air chamber _a_. The tube is\r\nclosed at _g_, and the pumps _e e_ drive water into the air chamber.\r\nAt length the tap is opened, and the air drives the water out as it is\r\ncontinually supplied (fig. 54).\r\n\r\nCompressed air was also used for driving the boring machines in the\r\nMount Cenis tunnel. In this case also the air was compressed by water,\r\nand then let loose, like steam, to drive a machine furnished with\r\nboring instruments.\r\n\r\nA pretty little toy may be made, and at the same time exemplify an\r\ninteresting fact in Physics. It is called the _ludion_, and it “lies in\r\na nut shell” in every sense. When the kernel has been extracted from\r\nthe shell, fasten the portions together with sealing wax, so that no\r\nwater can enter. At one end O, as in the illustration, leave\r\na small hole about as large as a pin’s head; fasten two threads to the\r\nsealing wax, and to the threads a wooden doll. Let a weight be attached\r\nto his waist. When the figure is in equilibrium, and will float, put it\r\ninto a jar of water, and tie a piece of bladder over the top. If this\r\ncovering be pressed with the finger, the doll will descend and remount\r\nwhen the finger is removed. By quick successive pressure the figure may\r\nbe made to execute a _pas seul_. The reason of the movement is because\r\nthe slight cushion of air in the upper part of the vase is compressed,\r\nand the little water thus caused to enter the nut shell makes it\r\nheavier, and it descends with the figure (fig. 56).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.—The Pump.]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that air is a gas, that it exercises pressure, that it\r\npossesses weight. We know it can be applied to many useful purposes,\r\nand that the air machines and inventions—such as the air-pump and\r\nthe “Pneumatic Despatch”—are in daily use in our laboratories, our\r\nsteam engines, our condensed milk manufactories, and in many other\r\nindustries, and for our social benefit. Compressed air is a powerful\r\nmotor for boring machinery in tunnels where steam cannot be used, even\r\nif water could be supplied, for smoke or fire would suffocate the\r\nworkers. To air we owe our life and our happiness on earth.\r\n\r\nPneumatics, then, deals with the mechanical properties of elastic\r\nfluids represented by air. A gas is an elastic fluid, and differs very\r\nconsiderably, from water; for a gas will fill a large or small space\r\nwith equal convenience, like the genii which came out of the bottle and\r\nobligingly retired into it again to please the fisherman. We have seen\r\nthat the pressure of the air is 14⅘ per square inch at a temperature\r\nof 32°. It is not so easy to determine the pressure of air at various\r\ntimes as that of water. We can always tell the pressure of a column of\r\nwater when we find the height of the column, as it is the weight of so\r\nmany cubic inches of the liquid. But the pressure of the atmosphere per\r\nsquare inch at any point is equal to the weight of a vertical column\r\nof air one inch square, reaching from that point to the limit of the\r\natmosphere above it. Still the density is not the same at all points,\r\nso we have to calculate. The average pressure at sea level is 14·7\r\nper square inch, and sustains a column of mercury 1 square inch in\r\nthickness, 29·92, or say 30 inches high. These are the data upon which\r\nthe barometer is based, as we have seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig: 56.—The “Ludion.”]\r\n\r\nIn our article upon “Chemistry” we will speak more fully of the\r\natmosphere and of its constituents, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n ABOUT WATER—HYDROSTATICS AND HYDRAULICS—LAW OF ARCHIMEDES—THE BRAMAH\r\n PRESS—THE SYPHON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present we will pass from Air to Water, from Pneumatics to\r\nHydrostatics and Hydraulics. We must remember that Hydrostatics and\r\nHydraulics are very different. The former treats of the weight and\r\npressure of liquids when they are at rest, the latter treats of them in\r\nmotion. We will now speak of the properties of Liquids, of which Water\r\nmay be taken as the most familiar example.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Matter exists in the form of Solids, Liquids,\r\nand Gases, and of course Water is one form of Matter. It occupies a\r\ncertain space, is slightly compressible; it possesses weight, and\r\nexercises force when in motion. It is a fluid, but also a liquid. There\r\nare fluids not liquid, such as air or steam, to take equally familiar\r\nexamples. These are elastic fluids and compressible, while water is\r\ninelastic, and termed incompressible.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of water will be considered hereafter, but at\r\npresent we may state that water is composed of oxygen and hydrogen, and\r\nproportions of eight of the former to one of the latter by weight; in\r\nvolume the hydrogen is as two to one.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, as regards water, we learn that volume and weight\r\nare very different things,—that equal volumes of various things may\r\nhave different weights, and that volume (or bulk) by no means indicates\r\nweight Equal volumes of feathers and sand will weigh very differently.\r\n\r\n [The old “catch” question of the “difference in weight between a pound\r\n of lead and a pound of feathers” here comes to the mind. The answer\r\n generally given is that “feathers make the heavier ‘pound’ because\r\n they are weighed by avoirdupois, and lead by troy weight.” This is an\r\n error. They are both weighed in the same way, and pound for pound are\r\n the same _weight_, though different in _volume_.]\r\n\r\nFluids in equilibrium have all their particles at the same distance\r\nfrom the centre of the earth, and although within small distances\r\nliquids appear perfectly level (in a direct line), they must, as the\r\nsea does, conform to the shape of the earth, though in small levels the\r\nspace is too limited to admit of any deviation from the plane at right\r\nangle to the direction of gravity.\r\n\r\nLiquids always fall to a perfectly level surface, and water will seek\r\nto find its original level, whether it be in one side of a bent tube,\r\nin a watering pot and its spout, or as a fountain. The surface of the\r\nwater will be on the same level in the arms of a bent tube, and the\r\nfountain will rise to a height corresponding with the elevation of the\r\nparent spring whence it issues. The waterworks companies first pump\r\nthe water to a high reservoir, and then it rises equally high in our\r\nhigh-level cisterns.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the force of water, a pretty little experiment may be\r\neasily tried, and, as many of our readers have seen in a shop in the\r\nStrand in London, it always is attractive. A good-sized glass shade\r\nshould be procured and placed over a water tap and basin, as per the\r\nillustration herewith. Within the glass put a number of balls of cork\r\nor other light material. Let a stop-cock, with a small aperture, be\r\nfixed upon the tube leading into the glass. Another tube to carry away\r\nthe water should, of course, be provided, but it may be used over\r\nagain. When the tap is properly fixed, if the pressure of the water be\r\nsufficient, it will rush out with some force, and catching the balls as\r\nthey fall to the bottom of the glass shade bear them up as a juggler\r\nwould throw oranges from hand to hand. If coloured balls be used the\r\neffect may be enhanced, and much variety imparted to the experiment,\r\nwhich is very easy to make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.—Water jet and balls.]\r\n\r\nWater exercises an enormous pressure, but the pressure does not depend\r\nupon the amount of water in the vessel. It depends upon the vessel’s\r\nheight, and the dimensions of the base. This has been proved by filling\r\nvessels whose bases and heights are equal, but whose shapes are\r\ndifferent, each holding a different quantity of water. The pressure at\r\nthe bottom of each vessel is the same, and depends upon the depth of\r\nthe water. If we subject a portion of the liquid surface to certain\r\nforce, this pressure will be dispersed equally in all directions, and\r\nfrom an acquaintance with this fact the Hydraulic Press was brought\r\ninto notice. If a vessel with a horizontal bottom be filled with water\r\nto a depth of one foot, every square foot will sustain a pressure of\r\n62·37 lbs., and each square inch of 0·433 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 58, 59, 60, 61.—Pressure of Water.]\r\n\r\nWe will now explain the principle of this WATER PRESS. In the small\r\ndiagram, the letters A B represent the bottom of a cylinder which has a\r\npiston fitted in it (P). Into the opposite side a pipe is let in, which\r\nleads from a force-pump D, which is fitted with a valve E, opening\r\nupwards. When the piston in D is pulled up water enters through the\r\nvalve; when the piston is forced down the valve shuts, and the water\r\nrushes into the chamber A B. The pressure pushes up the large piston\r\nwith a force multiplied as many times as the area of the small piston\r\nis contained in the large one. So if the large one be ten times as\r\ngreat as the small one, and the latter be forced down with a 10 lb.\r\npressure, the pressure on the large one will be 100 lbs., and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.—Water Press.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows the form of the Hydraulic or Bramah\r\nPress. A B C D is a strong frame, F the force-pump worked by means of\r\na lever fixed at G, and H is the counterprise. E is the stop-cock to\r\nadmit the water (fig. 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.—Bramah Press.]\r\n\r\nThe principles of hydrostatics will be easily explained. The Lectures\r\nof M. Aimé Schuster, Professor and Librarian at Metz, have taught us in\r\na very simple manner the principle of Archimedes, in which it is laid\r\ndown that “a body immersed in a liquid loses a portion of its weight\r\nequal to the weight of the liquid displaced by it.” We take a body\r\nof as irregular form as we please; a stone, for example. A thread is\r\nattached to the stone, and it is then placed in a glass of water full\r\nup to the brim. The water overflows; a volume of the liquid equal to\r\nthat of the stone runs over. The glass thus partially emptied is then\r\ndried, and placed on the scale of a balance, beneath which we suspend\r\nthe stone; equilibrium is established by placing some pieces of lead\r\nin the other scale. We then take a vase full of water, into which we\r\nplunge the stone suspended from the scale, supporting the vase by means\r\nof bricks. The equilibrium is now broken; to re-establish it, it is\r\nnecessary to fill up with water the glass placed on the scale; that\r\nis to say, we put back in the glass the weight of a volume of water\r\nprecisely equal to that of the stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.—Demonstration of the upward pressure of\r\nliquids.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to investigate the principles relating to connected\r\nvessels, springs of water, artesian wells, etc., two funnels, connected\r\nby means of an india-rubber tube of certain length, will serve for the\r\ndemonstration; and by placing the first funnel at a higher level, and\r\npouring in water abundantly, we shall see that it overflows from the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nA disc of cardboard and a lamp-glass will be all that is required to\r\nshow the upward pressure of liquids. I apply to the opening of the\r\nlamp-glass a round piece of cardboard, which I hold in place by means\r\nof a string; the tube thus closed I plunge into a vessel filled with\r\nwater. The piece of cardboard is held by the pressure of the water\r\nupwards. To separate it from the opening it suffices to pour some\r\nwater into the tube up to the level of the water outside (fig. 64). The\r\nouter pressure exercised on the disc, as well as the pressure beneath,\r\nis now equal to the weight of a body of water having for its base the\r\nsurface of the opening of the tube, its depth being the distance from\r\nthe cardboard to the level of the water.\r\n\r\nSyringes, pumps, etc., are the effects of atmospheric pressure.\r\nBalloons rise in the air by means of the pressure of gas; a balloon\r\nbeing a body plunged in gas, is consequently submitted to the same laws\r\nas a body plunged in water.\r\n\r\nBoats float because of the pressure of liquid, and water spurts from\r\na fountain for the same reason. I recollect having read a very useful\r\napplication of the principles of fluid pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 65.—Experiment on the convexity of a meniscus.]\r\n\r\nA horse was laden with two tubs for carrying a supply of water, and\r\nin the bottom of the tubs a valve was fixed. When the horse entered\r\nthe stream the tubs were partly immersed; the water then exercised its\r\nupward pressure, the valve opened, and the tubs slowly filled. When\r\nthey were nearly full the horse turned round and came out of the water;\r\nthe pressure had ceased.\r\n\r\nThus the action of the water first opened the valve, and then closed it.\r\n\r\nThe particular phenomena observable in the water level in narrow\r\nspaces, as of a fine glass tube, or the level of two adjoining waves,\r\ncapillary phenomena, etc., do not need any special appliance for\r\ndemonstration, and it is the same with the convexity or concavity of\r\nmeniscuses.\r\n\r\nFig. 65 represents a pretty experiment in connection with these\r\nphenomena. I take a glass, which I fill up to the brim, taking care\r\nthat the meniscus be concave, and near it I place a pile of pennies.\r\nI then ask my young friends how many pennies can be thrown into the\r\nglass without the water overflowing. Everyone who is not familiar with\r\nthe experiment will answer that it will only be possible to put in one\r\nor two, whereas it is possible to put in a considerable number, even\r\nten or twelve. As the pennies are carefully and slowly dropped in, the\r\nsurface of the liquid will be seen to become more and more convex, and\r\none is surprised to what an extent this convexity increases before the\r\nwater overflows.\r\n\r\nThe common _syphon_ may be mentioned here. It consists of a bent tube\r\nwith limbs of unequal length. We give an illustration of the syphon\r\n(fig. 66). The shorter leg being put into the mixture, the air is\r\nexhausted from the tube at _o_, the aperture at _g_ being closed with\r\nthe finger. When the finger is removed the liquid will run out. If the\r\nwater were equally high in both legs the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nwould hold the fluid in equilibrium, but one leg being longer, the\r\ncolumn of water in it preponderates, and as it falls, the pressure on\r\nthe water in the vessel keeps up the supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.—The Syphon.]\r\n\r\nApropos of the syphon, we may mention a very simple application of the\r\nprinciple. Cut off a strip of cloth, and arrange it so that one end\r\nshall remain in a glass of water while the other hangs down, as in the\r\nillustration. In a short time the water from the upper glass will have\r\npassed through the cloth-fibres to the lower one (fig. 67).\r\n\r\nThis attribute of porous substances is called _capillarity_, and shows\r\nitself by _capillary attraction_ in very fine pores or tubes. The same\r\nphenomenon is exhibited in blotting paper, sugar, wood, sand, and\r\nlamp-wicks, all of which give familiar instances of capillarity. The\r\ncook makes use of this property by using thin paper to absorb grease\r\nfrom the surface of soups.\r\n\r\nCapillarity (referred to on page 25) is the term used to define\r\ncapillary force, and is derived from the word _capillus_, a hair; and\r\nso very small bore tubes are called capillary tubes. We know that when\r\nwe plunge a glass tube into water the liquid will rise up in it, and\r\nthe narrower the tube the higher the water will go; moreover, the water\r\ninside will be higher than at the outside. This is in accordance with a\r\nwell-known law of adhesion, which induces concave or convex surfaces[9]\r\nin the liquids in the tubes, according as the tube is wetted with the\r\nliquid or not. For instance, water, as we have said, will be higher in\r\nthe tube, and concave in form; but mercury will be depressed below the\r\noutside level, and convex, because mercury will not adhere to glass.\r\nWhen the force of cohesion to the sides of the tube is more than twice\r\nas great as the adhesion of the particles of the liquid, it will rise\r\nup the sides, and if the forces be reversed, the rounded appearance\r\nwill follow. This accounts for the convex appearance, or “meniscus,” in\r\nthe column of mercury in a barometer.\r\n\r\nAmongst the complicated experiments to demonstrate molecular\r\nattraction, the following is very simple and very pretty:—Take two\r\nsmall balls of cork, and having placed them in a basin half-filled with\r\nwater, let them come close to each other. When they have approached\r\nwithin a certain distance they will rush together. If you fix one of\r\nthem on the blade of your penknife, it will attract the other as a\r\nmagnet, so that you can lead it round the basin (fig. 68). But if the\r\nballs of cork are covered with grease they will _repel_ each other,\r\nwhich fact is accounted for by the form of the _menisques_, which are\r\nconvex or concave, according as they are moistened, or preserved from\r\naction of the water by the grease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.—An improvised syphon.]\r\n\r\nThis attribute is of great use in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\nThe rising of the sap is one instance of the latter.\r\n\r\nExperience in hydrostatics can be easily applied to amusing little\r\nexperiments. For instance, as regards the syphon, we may make an image\r\nof _Tantalus_ as per illustration (fig. 69). A wooden figure may be cut\r\nin a stooping posture, and placed in the centre of a wide vase, as if\r\nabout to drink. If water be poured slowly into the vase it will never\r\nrise to the mouth of the figure, and the unhappy _Tantalus_ will remain\r\nin expectancy. This result is obtained by the aid of a syphon hidden in\r\nthe figure, the shorter limb of which is in the chest. The longer limb\r\ndescends through a hole in the table, and carries off the water. These\r\nvases are called _vases of Tantalus_.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the syphon may also be adapted to our domestic\r\nfilters. Charcoal, as we know, makes an excellent filter, and if we\r\nhave a block of charcoal in one of those filters,—now so common,—we can\r\nfix a tube into it, and clear any water we may require. It sometimes\r\n(in the country) happens that drinking-water may become turgid, and in\r\nsuch a case the syphon filter will be found useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.—Molecular attraction.]\r\n\r\nThe old “deception” jugs have often puzzled people. We give an\r\nillustration of one, and also a sketch of the “deceptive” portion\r\n(figs. 70 and 71). This deception is very well managed, and will create\r\nmuch amusement if a jug can be procured; they were fashionable in the\r\neighteenth century, and previously. A cursory inspection of these\r\ncurious utensils will lead one to vote them utterly useless. They are,\r\nhowever, very quaint, and if not exactly useful are ornamental. They\r\nare so constructed, that if an inexperienced person wish to pour out\r\nthe wine or water contained in them, the liquid will run out through\r\nthe holes cut in the jug.\r\n\r\nTo use them with safety it is necessary to put the spout A in\r\none’s mouth, and close the opening B with the finger, and then\r\nby drawing in the breath, cause the water to mount to the lips by the\r\ntube which runs around the jug. The specimens herein delineated have\r\nbeen copied from some now existent in the museum of the Sèvres china\r\nmanufactory.\r\n\r\nThe _Buoyancy of Water_ is a very interesting subject, and a great\r\ndeal may be written respecting it. The swimmer will tell us that it is\r\neasier to float in salt water than in fresh. He knows by experience\r\n_how difficult it is to sink_ in the sea; and yet hundreds of people\r\nare drowned in the water, which, if they permitted it to exercise its\r\npower of buoyancy, would help to save life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.—Vase of Tantalus.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-water holds a considerable quantity of salt in solution, and\r\nthis adds to its resistance, or floating power. It is heavier than\r\nfresh water, and the Dead Sea is so salt that a man cannot possibly\r\nsink in it. This means that the man’s body, bulk for bulk, is much\r\nlighter than the water of the Dead Sea. A man will sink in fresh, or\r\nordinary salt water if the air in his lungs be exhausted, because\r\nwithout the air he is much heavier than water, bulk for bulk. So if\r\nanything is weighed in water, it apparently loses in weight exactly\r\nequal to its own bulk of water.\r\n\r\nWater is the means by which the _Specific Gravity_ of liquids or solids\r\nis found, and by it we can determine the relative densities of matter\r\nin proportion. Air is the standard for gases and vapours. Let us\r\nexamine this, and see what is meant by SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the difference existing between two equal\r\nvolumes of different substances, and their weight, which proves that\r\nthey may contain a different number of atoms in the same space. We also\r\nknow, from the principle of Archimedes, that _if a body be immersed in\r\na fluid, a portion of its weight will be sustained by the fluid equal\r\nto the weight of the fluid displaced_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.—Deception jugs of old pattern.]\r\n\r\n[This theorem is easily proved by filling a bucket with water, and\r\nmoving it about in water, when it will be easy to lift; and likewise\r\nthe human body may be easily sustained in water by a finger under the\r\nchin.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Archimedes discovered the displacement of liquids\r\nis well known, but is always interesting. King Hiero, of Syracuse,\r\nordered a crown of gold to be made, and when it had been completed\r\nand delivered to His Majesty, he had his doubts about the honesty of\r\nthe goldsmith, and called to Archimedes to tell him whether or not\r\nthe crown was of gold, pure and simple. Archimedes was puzzled, and\r\nwent home deep in thought. Still considering the problem he went to\r\nthe bath, and in his abstraction filled it to the brim. Stepping in he\r\nspilt a considerable quantity of water, and at once the idea struck\r\nhim that any body put into water would displace its own weight of the\r\nliquid. He did not wait to dress, but ran half-naked to the palace,\r\ncrying out, “Eureka, Eureka! I have found it, I have found it! “What\r\nhad he found?—He had solved the problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.—Section of jug.]\r\n\r\nHe got a lump of gold the same weight as the crown, and immersed it\r\nin water. He found it weighed nineteen times as much as its own bulk\r\nof water. But when he weighed the kings crown he found it displaced\r\nmore water than the pure gold had done, and consequently it had been\r\nadulterated by a lighter metal. He assumed that the alloy was silver,\r\nand by immersing lumps of silver and gold of equal weight with the\r\ncrown, and weighing the water that overflowed from each dip, he was\r\nable to tell the king how far he had been cheated by the goldsmith.\r\n\r\nIt is by this method now that we can ascertain the specific gravity of\r\nbodies. One cubic inch of water weighs about half an ounce (or to be\r\nexact, 252½ grains). Take a piece of lead and weigh it in air; it\r\nweighs, say, eleven ounces. Then weigh it in a vase of water, and it\r\nwill be only ten ounces in weight. So lead is eleven times heavier than\r\nwater, or eleven ounces of lead occupy the same space as one ounce of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.—Weighing metal in water.]\r\n\r\n[The heavier a fluid is, or the greater its density, the greater will\r\nbe the weight it will support. Therefore we can ascertain the purity\r\nor otherwise of certain liquids by using hydrometers, etc., which will\r\nfloat higher or lower in different liquids, and being gauged at the\r\nstandard of purity, we can ascertain (for instance) how much water is\r\nin the milk when supplied from the dairy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.—Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to SPECIFIC GRAVITY, which means the\r\n“Comparative density of any substance relatively to water,” or as\r\nProfessor Huxley says, “The weight of a volume of any liquid or solid\r\nin proportion to the weight of the same volume of water, at a known\r\ntemperature and pressure.”\r\n\r\nWater, therefore, is taken as the unit; so anything whose equal\r\nvolume under the same circumstances is twice as heavy as the water,\r\nis declared to have its specific gravity 2; if three-and-a-half times\r\nit is 3·5, and so on. We append a few examples; so we see that things\r\nwhich possess a higher specific gravity than water sink, which comes to\r\nthe same thing as saying they are heavier than water, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nTo find the specific gravity of any solid body proceed as above, in the\r\nexperiment of the lead. By weighing the substance in and out of water\r\nwe find the weight of the water displaced; that is, the first weight\r\nless the second. Divide the weight in air by the remainder, and we\r\nshall find the specific gravity of the substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.—Over-shot wheel of mill.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of specific gravities of some very different\r\nsubstances, taking water as the unit.\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------++----------+----------++------------+----------+\r\n  |Substance.| Specific ||Substance.| Specific ||Substance.  | Specific |\r\n  |          | Gravity. ||          | Gravity. ||            | Gravity. |\r\n  +----------+----------++----------+----------++------------+----------+\r\n  | Platinum |   21·5   || Iron     |   7·79   || Water      |   1·000  |\r\n  | Gold     |   19·5   || Tin      |   7·29   || Sea Water  |   1·026  |\r\n  | Mercury  |   13·59  || Granite  |   2·62   || Rain Water |   1·001  |\r\n  | Lead     |   11·45  || Oak Wood |   0·77   || Ice        |    ·916  |\r\n  | Silver   |   10·50  || Cork     |   0·24   || Ether      |   0·723  |\r\n  | Copper   |    8·96  || Milk     |   1·032  || Alcohol    |   0·793  |\r\n  +----------+----------++----------+----------++------------+----------+\r\n\r\nBut we have by no means exhausted the uses of water. Hydrodynamics,\r\nwhich is the alternative term for hydraulics, includes the\r\nconsideration of many forms of water-wheels, most of which, as\r\nmill-wheels, are under-shot, or over-shot accordingly as the water\r\npasses horizontally over the floats, or acts beneath them. These wheels\r\nare used in relation to the fall of water. If there is plenty of water\r\nand a slight fall, the under-shot wheel is used. If there is a good\r\nfall less water will suffice, as the weight and momentum of the falling\r\nliquid upon the paddles will turn the wheel. Here is the Persian\r\nwater-wheel, used for irrigation (fig. 75). The Archimedian Screw,\r\ncalled after its inventor, was one of the earliest modes of raising\r\nwater. It consists of a cylinder somewhat inclined, and a tube bent\r\nlike a screw within it. By turning the handle of the screw the water is\r\ndrawn up and flows out from the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.—Irrigation wheel in Egypt.]\r\n\r\nThe Water Ram is a machine used for raising water to a great height by\r\nmeans of the momentum of falling water.\r\n\r\nThe Hydraulic Lift is familiar to us all, as it acts in our hotels, and\r\nwe need only mention these appliances here; full descriptions will be\r\nfound in Cyclopædias.\r\n\r\nWe have by no means exhausted the subject of Water in this chapter. Far\r\nfrom it. But when we come to Chemistry and Physical Geography we shall\r\nhave more to tell, and our remarks as to the application of science to\r\nDomestic Economy, in accordance with our plan, will also lead us up to\r\nsome of the uses of water. So for the present we will take our leave\r\nof water in a liquid form, and meet it again under the application of\r\nHeat, which subject will take us to Ice and Steam,—two very different\r\nconditions of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The curved surface of a column of liquid is termed a “meniscus,”\r\nfrom the Greek word _meniskos_, meaning “a little lens.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n HEAT—WHAT IT IS—THEORY OF HEAT—THE THERMOMETER—EXPANSION BY\r\n HEAT—EBULLITION AND DISTILLATION—LATENT HEAT—SPECIFIC HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Heat?—We will consider this question, and endeavour to explain\r\nit before we speak of its effects on water and other matter.\r\n\r\nHeat is now believed to be the effects of the rapid motion of all\r\nthe particles of a body. It is quite certain that a heated body is\r\nno heavier than the same body before it was made “hot,” so the heat\r\ncould not have gone into it, nor does the “heat” leave it when it has\r\nbecome what we call “cold,” which is a relative term. Heat is therefore\r\nbelieved to be a vibratory motion, or the effects of very rapid motion\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\nThe Science of Heat, as we may term it, is only in its infancy, or\r\ncertainly has scarcely come of age. Formerly heat was considered a\r\nchemical agent, and was termed caloric, but now heat is found to\r\nbe motion, which affects our nerves of feeling and sight; and, as\r\nProfessor Stewart tells us, “a heated body gives a series of blows to\r\nthe medium around it; and although these blows do not affect the ear,\r\nthey affect the eye, and give us a sense of light.”\r\n\r\nAlthough it is only within a comparatively few years that heat has been\r\nreally looked upon as other than matter, many ancient philosophers\r\nregarded it as merely a _quality_ of matter. They thought it the active\r\nprinciple of the universe. Epicurus declared that heat was an effluxion\r\nof minute spherical particles possessing rapid motion, and Lucretius\r\nmaintained that the sun’s light and heat are the result of motion of\r\nprimary particles. Fire was worshipped as the active agent of the\r\nuniverse, and Prometheus was fabled to have stolen fire from heaven to\r\nvivify mankind. The views of the ancients were more or less adopted in\r\nthe Middle Ages; but John Locke recognized the theory of heat being a\r\nmotion of matter. He says: “What in our sensation is _heat_, in the\r\nobject is nothing but _motion_.”\r\n\r\nGradually two theories arose concerning heat;—one, the Material\r\ntheory—the theory of Caloric or Phlogiston; the other, the Kinetic\r\ntheory. Before the beginning of the present century the former theory\r\nwas generally accepted, and the development of heat was accounted for\r\nby asserting that the friction or percussion altered the capacity\r\nfor heat of the substances acted upon. The heat was squeezed out by\r\nthe hammer, and the amount of heat in the world was regarded as a\r\ncertain quantity, which passed from one body to another, and that some\r\nsubstances contained, or could “store away,” more of the material\r\ncalled heat than other substances. Heat was the material of fire—the\r\nprinciple of it, or _materia ignis_; and by these theories Heat,\r\nor Caloric, was gradually adopted as a separate material agent—an\r\ninvisible and subtle matter producing certain phenomena when liberated.\r\n\r\nSo the two theories concerning heat arose at the end of the last\r\ncentury. One, as we have said, is known as the Material, the other as\r\nthe Kinetic theory. The latter is the theory of motion, so called from\r\nthe Greek _kinesis_ (motion), or sometimes known as the Dynamic theory\r\nof heat, from _dunamis_ (force); or again as Thermo-dynamics.\r\n\r\nBut any possibility of producing a new supply of heat was denied by the\r\nmaterialists. They knew that some bodies possessed a greater capacity\r\nfor heat than others; but Count Rumford, at Munich, in 1797, astonished\r\nan audience by making water boil without any fire! He had observed the\r\ngreat extent to which a cannon became heated while being bored in the\r\ngun factory, and influenced by those who maintained the material theory\r\nof heat, paid great attention to the evolution of heat. He accordingly\r\nendeavoured to produce heat by friction, and by means of horse power\r\nhe caused a steel borer to work upon a cylinder of metal. The shavings\r\nwere permitted to drop into a pan of water at 60° Fahrenheit. In an\r\nhour after the commencement of the operation the temperature of the\r\nwater had risen to 107°: in another half-hour the heat of it was up\r\nto 142°: and in two hours had measured 170°. Upon this he says: “It\r\nis hardly necessary to add that anything which any insulated body or\r\nsystem of bodies can continue to furnish without limitation cannot\r\npossibly be a material substance, and it appears to me to be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of\r\nanything capable of being excited and communicated in these experiments\r\nexcept by _motion_.”\r\n\r\nA few years later Sir Humphrey Davy made his conclusive experiments,\r\nand the Material theory of heat received its death-blow.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Davy—referring to the fact that water at a freezing\r\ntemperature has “more heat in it” (as it was believed) than ice at the\r\nsame temperature—said: “If I, by friction, liquify ice, a substance\r\nwill be produced which contains a far greater absolute amount of heat\r\nthan ice. In this case it cannot reasonably be affirmed that I merely\r\nrender _sensible_ heat which had been previously _insensible_ in the\r\nfrozen mass. Liquification will conclusively prove the _generation_ of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning could not be doubted. Sir Humphrey Davy made the\r\nexperiment. He rubbed together two pieces of ice in the air, and in\r\na vacuum surrounded by a freezing mixture. The ice became liquified,\r\nand so the generation of heat by “mechanical means” was proved. Its\r\nimmateriality was demonstrated, but the Material theory was not even\r\nthen abandoned by its adherents.\r\n\r\nSo things continued, until in 1842-3, Doctor Julius Meyer, of\r\nHeilbronn, and Doctor Joule, of Manchester, separately, and by\r\ndifferent means, arrived at the conclusion that a certain definite\r\namount of mechanical work corresponds to a certain definite amount\r\nof Heat, and _vice versâ_. Thus was a great support afforded to\r\nthe Dynamic theory. This fact Doctor Joule communicated to the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ in 1843, and the conclusions he came to were—\r\n\r\n 1. “That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies,\r\n whether solid or liquid, is always in proportion to the force expended;\r\n\r\n 2. “That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of\r\n a pound of water (weighed _in vacuo_ and taken at between 55° and 60°\r\n Fahr.) by 1° Fahr., requires for its evolution the expenditure of a\r\n mechanical force represented by the fall of 772 lbs. through the space\r\n of one foot.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.—Melting a piece of tin on a card.]\r\n\r\nThis is the “mechanical equivalent of heat.” The first paper written\r\nby Mr. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of water rises when\r\nforced through narrow tubes; and to heat it one degree, the force of\r\n770 foot pounds was necessary, which means that the 1 lb. of water\r\nfalling 770 feet, got hotter by one degree when it reached the earth.\r\nHe subsequently arrived at the more exact conclusions quoted above.\r\n\r\nSo heat is now known to be a series of vibrations, or vibratory\r\nmotions, as sound vibrations, which we cannot hear nor see, but the\r\neffects of which are known to us as light and heat.\r\n\r\nIn considering heat we must put aside the idea of warmth and cold, for\r\nthey are only different degrees of heat, not the absence of it.\r\n\r\nThe study of heat can be briefly undertaken without any complicated\r\napparatus. If we desire a proof of the great conducting power of\r\nmetals, let us place a fine piece of muslin tightly stretched over\r\na lump of polished metal. On the muslin we put a burning ember, and\r\nexcite combustion by blowing on it; the muslin is not burned in the\r\nleast, the heat being entirely absorbed by the metal, which draws\r\nit through the material into itself. Fig. 76 represents a similar\r\nexperiment: it consists of melting some tin on a playing card, held\r\nover the flame of a spirit lamp. The metal becomes completely melted\r\nwithout the card being burnt. It is through a similar effect that\r\nmetals appear cold to us when we take them in our hands; by their\r\nconductibility they remove the heat from our hands, and give us the\r\npeculiar impression which we do not experience when in contact with\r\nsubstances that are bad conductors, such as wood, woollen materials,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.—Boiling water in a paper case.]\r\n\r\nFig. 77 shows the method of boiling water in paper. We make a small\r\npaper box, such as those made by school-boys, and suspend it by four\r\nthreads to a piece of wood held horizontally at a suitable height. We\r\nfill this improvised vessel with water, and place it over the flame of\r\na spirit lamp. The paper is not burnt, because the water absorbs all\r\nthe heat into itself. After a few minutes the water begins to boil,\r\nsending forth clouds of steam, but the paper remains intact. It is well\r\nto perform this operation over a plate, in case of accident, as the\r\nwater may be spilt. We may also make use of an egg-shell as a little\r\nvessel in which to heat the water, by resting it on a wire ring over\r\nthe flame of the spirit lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.—Experiment on the regelation of ice.]\r\n\r\nFig. 78 shows the arrangement of a very remarkable experiment, but\r\nlittle known, on the refreezing of ice. A block of ice is placed on the\r\nedge of two iron chairs, and is encircled by a piece of wire, to which\r\nis suspended the weight of say five pounds. The wire penetrates slowly,\r\nand in about an hour’s time has passed completely through the lump\r\nof ice, and the weight, with the piece of wire, falls to the ground.\r\nWhat happens then to the block of ice?—You imagine, doubtless, that\r\nit is cut in two. No such thing; it is intact, and in a single lump\r\nas it was previous to the experiment. In proportion as the wire was\r\nsunk through the mass, the slit has been closed again by refreezing.\r\nIce or snow during the winter may serve for a number of experiments\r\nrelating to heat. If we wish to demonstrate the influence of colours\r\non radiation, we take two pieces of cloth of the same size,—one white,\r\nand the other black,—and place them both on the snow, if possible,\r\nwhen there is a gleam of sunlight. In a short time it will be found\r\nthat the snow underneath the black cloth has melted to a much greater\r\nextent than that beneath the white cloth, because black absorbs heat\r\nmore than white, which, on the contrary, has a tendency to reflect it.\r\nWe perceive very plainly the difference in temperature by touching the\r\ntwo cloths. The white cloth feels cold in comparison with the black\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out experiments on the expansion of\r\nbodies. They can be performed in a number of different ways; by placing\r\nwater in a narrow-necked bottle, and warming it over the fire, we can\r\nascertain the expansion of liquids under the influence of heat. We may\r\nin this way construct a complete thermometer.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the _Sources of Heat_, or causes of its\r\ndevelopment, which are various, and in many cases apparent. The first\r\ngreat source is the Sun, and it has been calculated that the heat\r\nreceived by the earth in one year is sufficient to melt an envelope\r\nof ice surrounding it one hundred and five feet thick. Of course the\r\nheat at the surface of the sun is enormously greater than this, about\r\none-half being absorbed in the atmosphere before it reaches us at all.\r\nIn fact, it is impossible to give you an idea of the enormous heat\r\ngiven out by the sun to the earth (which is a _very_ small fraction\r\nindeed of the whole), stars, and planets, all of which give out heat.\r\nWe know that heat is stored in the earth, and that it is in a very\r\nactive condition we can perceive from the hot springs, lava, and flame\r\nwhich are continually erupting from the earth in various places. These\r\nsources of heat are beyond our control.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the extra- and intra-terrestrial sources of heat there\r\nare mechanical causes for its generation upon our globe, such as\r\nfriction, percussion, or compression. The savage or the woodman can\r\nprocure heat and fire by rubbing a pointed stick in a grooved log. The\r\nwooden “breaks” of a locomotive are often set on fire by friction of\r\nthe wheels, so they require grease, and the wheels on the rails will\r\ndevelop heat and sparks. Our matches, and many other common instances\r\nof the generation of heat (and fire) by friction, will occur to every\r\nreader. Water may be heated by shaking it in a bottle, taking care to\r\nwrap something round it to keep the warmth of the hand from the glass.\r\nBy percussion, such as hammering a nail or piece of iron, the solid\r\nbar may be made “red-hot”; and when cannon are bored at Woolwich the\r\nshavings of steel are too hot to hold even if soap-and-water has been\r\nplaying upon the boring-machine.\r\n\r\nThe production of heat by chemical action is termed _combustion_, and\r\nthis is the means by which all artificial heat for our daily wants is\r\nsupplied. We can also produce heat by electricity. A familiar and not\r\nalways pleasant instance of this is seen in the flash of lightning\r\nwhich will fuse metals, and experiment may do the same upon a smaller\r\nscale. These are, in brief, the Sources of Heat, and we may speak of\r\nits effects.\r\n\r\nWe may take it for granted that no matter from what source heat is\r\nderived, it exhibits the same phenomena in its relation to objects. One\r\nof the most usual of these phenomena is expansion. Let us take water,\r\nand see the effect of heat upon it.\r\n\r\nWe know that a certain weight of water under the same conditions has\r\nalways the same volume; and although the attributes of the liquid\r\nvary under different circumstances, under the _same_ conditions its\r\nproperties are exactly the same. Now, water expands very much when\r\nunder the influence of heat, like all liquids; solids and gases also\r\nexpand upon the application of heat.\r\n\r\nWe can easily establish these statements. A metallic ring when heated\r\nis larger than when cool. A small quantity of air in a bladder when\r\nheated will fill the bladder, and water will boil over the vessel, or\r\nexpand into steam, and perhaps burst the boiler. So expansion is the\r\ntendency of what we term heat.\r\n\r\nWe make use of this quality of heat in the thermometer, by which we\r\ncan measure the temperature not only of liquids or solids, but of\r\nthe atmosphere. The reading of the thermometer varies in different\r\ncountries, for the degrees are differently marked, but the construction\r\nof the instrument is the same. It is called thermometer from two\r\nGreek words signifying the measure of heat. It is a notable fact that\r\nCastelli, writing in 1638, says to Ferdinand Cæsarina: “I remembered\r\nan experiment which Signor Galileo had shown me more than thirty-five\r\nyears ago. He took a glass bottle about the size of a hen’s egg, the\r\nneck of which was two palms long, and as narrow as a straw. Having\r\nwell heated the bulb in his hands, he placed its mouth in a vessel\r\ncontaining water, and withdrawing the heat of his hand from the bulb,\r\nthe water instantly rose in the neck more than a palm above the level\r\nof the water in the vessel.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have an air-thermometer, but as it was affected by the\r\n_pressure_ as well as the temperature of the atmosphere, it could not\r\nbe relied upon as a “measurer of heat.” Until Torricelli propounded\r\nthe principle of the barometer, this “weather-glass” of Galileo was\r\nused, for the philosopher divided the stem into divisions, and the\r\nair-thermometer served the purpose of our modern instruments.\r\n\r\nThe actual inventor of the thermometer is not known. It has been\r\nattributed to Galileo, to Drebbel, and to Robert Fludd. There is little\r\ndoubt, however, that Galileo and Drebbel were both acquainted with it,\r\nbut whether either claimed the honour of the invention, whether they\r\ndiscovered it independently, or together, we cannot say. Sanctorio, of\r\nPadua, and Drebbel have also been credited with the invention. We may\r\nadd that the spirit thermometer was invented in 1655-1656. It was a\r\nrough form of our present thermometer, and roughly graduated. But it\r\nwas hermetically closed to the air, and a great improvement on the old\r\n“weather-glass. Edmond Halley introduced mercury as the liquid for the\r\ninstrument in 1680. Otto von Guerike first suggested the freezing point\r\nof water as the lowest limit, and Renaldini, in 1694, proposed that the\r\nboiling and freezing points of water should be the limit of the scale.\r\n\r\nLet us now explain the construction and varied markings of the three\r\nkinds of thermometers in use. By noting the differences between the\r\nscales every reader will be able to read the records from foreign\r\ncountries noted upon the Centigrade and Réaumur instruments, which are\r\nall based upon the theory that heat expands liquids.\r\n\r\n[We used to hear the expression, “Heat expands, and cold contracts,”\r\nbut we trust that all our readers have now learnt that there is no\r\nsuch thing as _cold_. It is only a negative term. We feel things cold\r\nbecause they extract some warmth from our fingers, not because the\r\nsubstances have no heat.]\r\n\r\nThermometers are made of very fine bore glass tubes. One end has a\r\nbowl, or bulb, the other is at first open. By heating the bowl the air\r\nin the tube is driven away by the open end, which is quickly dipped in\r\na bowl of mercury. The mercury will then occupy a certain space in the\r\ntube; and if it be heated till the liquid boils, all the air will be\r\ndriven out by the mercurial vapour. By once again dipping the tube in\r\nthe quicksilver the glass will be filled. Then, before it cools, close\r\nthe open end of the tube, and the thermometer is so far made. Having\r\nnow caught our thermometer we must proceed to mark it, which is an easy\r\nprocess. By plunging the mercury into pounded melting ice we can get\r\nthe freezing point, and boiling water will give us the boiling point.\r\nThe intermediate scale can be then indicated.\r\n\r\nIf mercury and glass expanded equally there would be no rise in the\r\nlatter. Extreme delicacy of the thermometer can be arrived at by using\r\na very fine tube, particularly if it be also flat.\r\n\r\nThe freezing point in Fahrenheit’s scale is 32°; in the Centigrade\r\nit is 0°, and the boiling point 100°. This was the scale adopted\r\nby Celsius, a Swede, and is much used. Réaumur called the freezing\r\npoint 0°, and the boiling point 80°. There is another scale, almost\r\nobsolete,—that of Delisle, who called boiling point zero, and freezing\r\npoint 150°.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in converting degrees on one scale into degrees\r\non the other. Fahrenheit made his zero at the greatest cold he could\r\nget; viz., snow and salt. The freezing point of water is 32° above his\r\nzero. Therefore 212-32 gives 180° the difference between the freezing\r\nand boiling points of water. So 180° Fahr. corresponds to 100° Cent.,\r\nand to 80° Réaumur, reckoning from freezing point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.—Thermometer.]\r\n\r\nThe following tables will explain the differences:—\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n  1° Fahr.  = 0·55° Cent., or 0·44° Réaumur.\r\n  1° Cent.  =  ·80° Réaumur, or 1·80° Fahr.\r\n  1° Réaumur = 1·25° Cent., or 2·25° Fahr.\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n  |---------------------------+-------+-------+---------|\r\n  |                           | Fahr. | Cent. | Réaumur.|\r\n  |---------------------------+-------+-------+---------|\r\n  | Boiling point             |  212  |  100  |   80    |\r\n  |                           |  194  |   90  |   72    |\r\n  |                           |  176  |   80  |   64    |\r\n  |                           |  158  |   70  |   56    |\r\n  |                           |  140  |   60  |   48    |\r\n  |                           |  122  |   50  |   40    |\r\n  |                           |  104  |   40  |   32    |\r\n  |                           |   86  |   30  |   24    |\r\n  |                           |   68  |   20  |   16    |\r\n  |                           |   50  |   10  |    8    |\r\n  | Freezing point of water   |   32  |    0  |    0    |\r\n  |                           |   14  |  -10  |   -8    |\r\n  |                           |   -4  |  -20  |  -16    |\r\n  | Freezing point of Mercury |  -40  |  -40  |  -32    |\r\n  |---------------------------+-------+-------+---------|\r\n\r\nAlcohol is used in thermometers in very cold districts, as it does not\r\nfreeze even at a temperature of -132° Fahr.\r\n\r\nWe have now explained the way in which we can measure heat by the\r\nexpansion of mercury in a tube. We can also find out that solids and\r\ngases expand also. Engineers always make allowances for the effects\r\nof winter and summer weather when building bridges; in summer the\r\nbridge gets longer, and unless due provision were made it would become\r\nstrained and weakened. So there are compensating girders, and the\r\nstructure remains safe.\r\n\r\nThe effects of expansion by heat are very great and very destructive at\r\ntimes. Instances of boilers bursting will occur to every reader. It is\r\nvery important to be able to ascertain the extent to which solid bodies\r\nwill expand. Such calculations have been made, and are in daily use.\r\n\r\nWe can crack a tumbler by pouring hot water into it, or by placing it\r\non the “hob.” A few minutes’ consideration will assure us that the\r\nlower particles of the glass expanded before the rest, and cracked our\r\ntumbler. A gradual heating, particularly if the glass be thin, will\r\nensure safety. Thick glass will crack sooner than thin.\r\n\r\nAgain, many people at railway stations have asked us, “Why don’t they\r\njoin the rails together on this line?” We reply that if every length\r\nof rail were tightly fixed against its neighbour, the whole railway\r\nwould be displaced. The iron expands and joins up close in hot weather.\r\nIn wet weather, also, the wooden pegs and the sleepers swell with\r\nmoisture, and get tightened up. Everyone knows how much more smoothly\r\na train travels in warm, wet weather. This is due to the expansion of\r\nthe iron and the swelling of the sleepers and pegs in the “chairs.”\r\nA railway 400 miles long expands 338 yards in summer,—that is the\r\ndifference in length between the laid railroad in summer and in winter.\r\n\r\nThis can be proved. Iron expands 0·001235 of its length for every\r\n180° Fahr. Divided by 180 it gives us the expansion for 1°, which is\r\n0·00000686, taking the difference of winter and summer at 70° Fahr.\r\nMultiply these together, and the result (0·00048620 of its length)\r\nby the number of yards in 400 miles, and we find our answer 338\r\nyards. Expansion acts in solids and most liquids by the destruction\r\nof cohesion between the particles. Gases, however, having much less\r\ncohesion amid the particles, will expand far more under a given heat\r\nthan either solids or liquids, and liquids expand more than solids for\r\nthe same reason, and more rapidly at a high temperature than at a low\r\none.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of expansion. We may give an instance in which the\r\nsubsequent contraction of heated metal is useful. Walls sometimes\r\nget out of the perpendicular, and require pulling together. No force\r\nwhich can be conveniently applied would accomplish this so well as the\r\ncooling force due to the potential energy of iron. Rods are passed\r\nthrough the walls and braced up by nuts. The rods are then heated, and\r\nas they cool they contract and pull the walls with them.\r\n\r\nWhen glass is suddenly cooled, the inner skin, as it were, presses with\r\ngreat force against the cooled surface, but as it is quite tight no\r\nexplosion can follow. But break the tail, or scratch it with a diamond,\r\nand the strain is taken off. The glass drop crumbles with the effect\r\nof the explosion, as in the cases of Prince Rupert’s drops, and the\r\nBologna flasks; the continuity is broken, and pulverization results.\r\n\r\nBut a very curious exception to the general laws of expansion is\r\nnoticed in the case of nearly freezing water. We know water expands\r\nby heat, at first gradually, and then to an enormous extent in steam.\r\nBut when cooling water, instead of getting more and more contracted,\r\nonly contracts down to 39·2° Fahr., it then begins to expand, and at\r\nthe moment it freezes into ice it expands very much—about one-twelfth\r\nof its volume, but according to Professor Huxley it weighs exactly the\r\nsame, and the steam produced from that given quantity of water will\r\nweigh just exactly what the water and the ice produced by it weigh\r\nindividually. At 39·2° Fahr. water is at its maximum density, or in\r\nother words, a vessel of a certain size will hold more water when it\r\nis at 39° Fahr. than at any other time. Whether the water be heated or\r\ncooled at this temperature, it _expands_ to the boiling or freezing\r\npoint when it becomes steam or ice, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nWater, when heated, is lighter than cold water. You can prove this in\r\nfilling a bath from two taps of hot and cold water at the same time.\r\nThe cold falls to the bottom, and if you do not stir up the water when\r\nmixed you will have a hot surface and a cold foundation. The heat\r\nincreases the volume of water, it becomes lighter, and comes uppermost.\r\n\r\nSteam and Water and Ice are all the same things under different\r\nconditions, although to the eye they are so different. They are alike\r\ninasmuch as a given weight of water will weigh as much when converted\r\ninto ice or developed into steam. The half ounce of water will weigh\r\nhalf an ounce as ice or as steam, but the volume or bulk will vary\r\ngreatly, as will be understood when we state that one cubic inch of\r\nwater will produce 1,700 cubic inches of steam, and 1-1/11 cubic inch\r\nof ice; but at the same time each will yield, when decomposed, just the\r\nsame amount of oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the _Effects of Heat upon Water_. We have all seen\r\nthe vapour that hangs above a locomotive engine. We call it “steam.” It\r\nis not pure steam, for steam is really invisible. The visible vapour is\r\nsteam on its way to become water again. On a very hot dry day we cannot\r\ndistinguish the vapour at all.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of heat upon water is to expand it; and as the heat\r\nis applied we know that the water continues to expand and bubble up;\r\nand at last, when the temperature is as high as 212°, we say water\r\n“boils”—that is, at that heat it begins to pass away in vapour, and you\r\nwill find that the temperature of the steam is the same as the boiling\r\nwater. While undergoing this transformation, the water increases in\r\nvolume to 1,700 times its original bulk, although it will weigh the\r\nsame as the water. So steam has 1,700 less specific gravity than water.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps scarcely necessary to remind our readers that water,\r\nwhen heated, assumes tremendous force. Air likewise expands with great\r\nviolence, and the vessels containing either steam or air frequently\r\nburst, with destructive effects. Solid bodies also expand when heated,\r\nand the most useful and accurate observations have been made, so that\r\nthe temperatures at which solid bodies expand are now exactly known.\r\nAir also expands by heat.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of Expansion by Heat, we may remark that a rapid\r\nmovement is imparted to the air by Heat. In any ordinary room the air\r\nbelow is cool, while if we mount a ladder to hang up a picture, for\r\ninstance, we shall find the air quite hot near the ceiling. This is\r\nquite in keeping with the effects of heat upon water. The hot particles\r\nrise to the top in a vessel, and thus a motion is conveyed to the\r\nwater. So in our rooms. The heated air rushes up the chimney and causes\r\na draught, and this produces motion, as we have seen by fig. 39, in\r\nwhich the cardboard spiral was set in motion by heated air. A balloon\r\nwill ascend, because it is filled with heated air or gas; and we all\r\nhave seen the paper balloons which will ascend if a sponge containing\r\nspirit of wine be set on fire underneath them.\r\n\r\nWinds are also only currents of air produced by unequal temperature in\r\ndifferent places. The heated air ascends, and the colder fluid rushes\r\nin sometimes with great velocity to fill the space. “Land” and “sea”\r\nbreezes are constant; the cool air blows in from the sea during the\r\nday, and as the land cools more rapidly at night, the breeze passes\r\nout again. When we touch upon _Meteorology_, we will have more to say\r\nrespecting Air Currents and the various Atmospheric Phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe know that water can be made to boil by heat, but it is not perhaps\r\ngenerally known that it will apparently boil by _cold_, and the\r\nexperiment may thus be made:—A flask half-full of water is maintained\r\nat ebullition for some minutes. It is removed from the source of heat,\r\ncorked, inverted, and placed in one of the rings of a retort stand. If\r\ncold water is poured on the upturned bottom of the flask, the fluid\r\nwill start into violent ebullition. The upper portion of the flask is\r\nfilled with steam, which maintains a certain pressure on the water.\r\nBy cooling the upper portion of the flask some of this is condensed,\r\nand the pressure reduced. The temperature at which water boils varies\r\nwith the pressure. When it is reduced, water boils at a lower heat. By\r\npouring the cold water over the flask we condense the steam so that the\r\nwater is hot enough to boil at the reduced pressure. To assert that\r\nwater boils by the application of cold is a chemical sophism.\r\n\r\n_Ebullition_ and _Evaporation_ may be now considered, and these are the\r\ntwo principal modes by which liquids assume the gaseous condition. The\r\ndifference is, when water boils we term it ebullition (from the Latin\r\n_ebullio_, I boil); evaporation means vapour given out by water not\r\nboiling (from _evaporo_, I disperse in vapour).\r\n\r\nThere are two operations based upon the properties which bodies possess\r\nof assuming the form of vapour under the influence of heat, which\r\nare called _Distillation_ and _Sublimation_. These we will consider\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nEbullition then means a bubbling up or boiling; and when water is\r\nheated in an open vessel two forces oppose its conversion into vapour;\r\nviz., its own cohesive force and atmospheric pressure. At length, at\r\n212° Fahr., the particles of water have gained by heat a force greater\r\nthan the opposing forces; bubbles of vapour rise up from the bottom and\r\ngo off in vapour. This is _ebullition_, and at that point the tension\r\nof the vapour is equal to the pressure of the atmosphere, for if not,\r\nthe bubbles would not form. All this time of boiling, notwithstanding\r\nany increase of heat, the thermometer will not rise above 212° (Fahr.),\r\nfor all the heat is employed in turning the water to steam.\r\n\r\nWe have said the ebullition takes place at 212° Fahr. (or 100° C.),\r\nbut that is only at a certain level. If we ascend 600 feet high we\r\nshall find that water will boil at a less temperature; and on the top\r\nof a mountain (say Mont Blanc) water will boil at 185° Fahr.; so at\r\nan elevation of three miles water boils at a temperature less by 27°\r\nFahr. An increase of pressure similarly will raise the boiling point\r\nof water. The heights of mountains are often ascertained by noticing\r\nthe boiling point of water on their summits, the general rule being a\r\nfall of one degree for every 530 feet elevation at medium altitudes. We\r\nappend a few instances taken at random:—\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n  |       Place.       |Height above level|  Barometer  | Boiling point |\r\n  |                    | of the sea—Feet. | mean height.|of water, Fahr.|\r\n  +--------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n  | Quito              |      9,541       |    20·75    |     194·2     |\r\n  | Mexico             |      7,471       |    22·52    |     198·1     |\r\n  | St. Gothard        |      6,808       |    23·07    |     199·2     |\r\n  | Garonne (Pyrenees) |      4,738       |    24·96    |     203·0     |\r\n  | Geneva             |      1,221       |    28·54    |     209·5     |\r\n  | Paris (1st floor)  |        213       |    29·69    |     211·5     |\r\n  | Sea level          |          0       |    30·00    |     212·0     |\r\n  +--------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n[The difference for a degree depends upon the height, varying between\r\n510 and 590 feet, according to the elevation reached. The approximate\r\nheight of a mountain can be found by multiplying 530 by the number\r\nof degrees between the boiling point and 212°. In some very elevated\r\nregions travellers have even failed to boil potatoes.]\r\n\r\nThe boiling point of liquid may be altered by mixing some substance\r\nwith it; and although such a substance as sawdust would not alter the\r\nboiling point of water, yet if the foreign matter be dissolved in the\r\nliquid it will alter the boiling point. Even the air dissolved in\r\nliquids alters their boiling point, and water freed from air will not\r\nboil till it is raised to a temperature much higher than 212° Fahr.\r\nWater will boil at a higher temperature in a glass vessel than in\r\nmetal, because there is a greater attraction between water and glass.\r\n\r\nWe said above that an increase of pressure will raise the boiling point\r\nof water. Under the pressure of one atmosphere—that is, when there\r\nis a pressure of 15 lbs. on the square inch—water boils at 212°. But\r\nunder a pressure of two atmospheres, the boiling point rises to 234°,\r\nand of four atmospheres, 294°. So we see by increasing the pressure\r\nthe water may be almost indefinitely heated, and it will not boil. We\r\ncan understand that in a very deep vessel the layer of water at the\r\nbottom has to sustain the pressure of the water in addition to the\r\nweight of the atmosphere above it. The pressure of thirty-four feet of\r\nwater is equal to the atmospheric pressure of 15 lbs. on the square\r\ninch, and thus at such a distance water must be heated to 234° before\r\nit will boil. Professor Bunsen founded his Theory of the Geysers upon\r\nthis fact, for he maintained that water falling into the earth lost\r\nmuch air, and required with the super-incumbent pressure a very high\r\ntemperature to boil it. When it did boil it generated steam so suddenly\r\nthat it exploded upwards, throwing up vapour and the water with it, as\r\nwater poured into a very hot basin will do.\r\n\r\n_Evaporation_ may now be considered, and is distinguished from\r\nEbullition by the production of vapour on the _surface_ of liquids, the\r\nlatter term signifying the formation of vapour in _the body_ of the\r\nliquid. Evaporation takes place at all temperatures, and from every\r\nliquid surface exposed to the air. We know what we call a “drying\r\nwind.” The air in fresh layers continually passing over the wet ground,\r\ntakes up the moisture; like the east wind, for instance, which has\r\ngreat capabilities of that nature. Damp air can only take up a certain\r\nquantity, and when it contains as much water as corresponds to the\r\ntemperature it can take no more, and is “saturated with moisture”;\r\nthen evaporation ceases. Heat is a great cause of evaporation, and\r\nthe greater the surface the more rapid the process, and in a vacuum\r\nmore readily than in atmospheric air. Evaporation is resorted to\r\nvery commonly to produce coolness; for instance, the universal fan,\r\nby increasing evaporation from a heated skin, generates a feeling\r\nof coolness; and we know the vaporization of ether will freeze into\r\ninsensibility. When a fluid evaporates we can tell that the heat passes\r\naway at the same time, for we cool water in porous jars, which permit\r\nsome of it to pass off in vapour, the remainder being cooled.\r\n\r\nSir John Leslie invented a method of freezing water by rapid\r\nevaporation on sulphuric acid under the receiver of an air-pump, and\r\nwater has been frozen even on a _hot plate_ by these means. By pouring\r\nsulphurous acid and water on this plate, the acid evaporates so quickly\r\nthat it produces sufficient cold to freeze the water it quitted into\r\nsolid ice.\r\n\r\nWe leave the phenomena of clouds and watery vapour in the atmosphere\r\nfor consideration on another opportunity, under the head of\r\n_Meteorology_, _Rain_, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.—Apparatus for freezing carafes of water.]\r\n\r\nAn experiment is often performed by which water is frozen in a vacuum.\r\nBy putting a saucer full of water under the receiver of an air-pump\r\nit will first boil, and then become a solid mass of ice. It is not\r\ndifficult to understand the cause of this. The water boils as soon as\r\nthe air is removed; but in order to pass from the liquid to the gaseous\r\nstate without the assistance of exterior heat, it gives out heat to the\r\nsurroundings, and in so doing becomes ice itself. This fact Mr. Carré\r\nhas made use of in the apparatus shown above (fig. 80). A small pump\r\ncreates a vacuum in the water bottles, and ice is formed in them.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus might easily be adopted in country houses, and in places\r\nwhere ice is difficult to procure in summer. The only inconvenience\r\nattending it is the employment of sulphuric acid, of which a\r\nconsiderable quantity is used to absorb the vapour from the water, as\r\nalready referred to. If proper precautions are taken, however, there\r\nwill be no danger in using the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe mode of proceeding is as follows:—The bottle full of water is\r\njoined to the air-pump by a tube, and after a few strokes the water\r\nis seen in ebullition. The vapour thus disengaged traverses an\r\nintermediate reservoir filled with sulphuric acid, which absorbs it,\r\nand immediately condenses it, producing intense cold. In the centre of\r\nthe liquid remaining in the carafe some needles of ice will be seen,\r\nwhich grow rapidly, and after a few more strokes of the pump the water\r\nwill be found transformed into a mass of ice. This is very easy of\r\naccomplishment, and in less than a minute the carafe full of water will\r\nbe found frozen.\r\n\r\nThe problem for the truly economical formation of ice by artificial\r\nmeans is one of those which have occupied chemists for a long time, but\r\nhitherto, notwithstanding all their efforts, no satisfactory conclusion\r\nhas been arrived at. Nearly every arrangement possesses some drawback\r\nto its complete success, which greatly increases the cost of the ice,\r\nand causes inconvenience in its production. The usual mode in large\r\ntowns is to collect the ice, in houses constructed for the purpose,\r\nduring the winter, and this simple method is also the best, so far as\r\nat present has been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.—Retort and Receiver.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with vaporization we may now mention two processes\r\nreferred to just now (page 83); viz., sublimation and distillation.\r\nThe former is the means whereby we change solid bodies into vapour\r\nand condense the vapour into proper vessels. The condensed substances\r\nwhen deposited are called _sublimates_, and when we go into Chemistry\r\nwe shall hear more of them. The mode of proceeding is to place the\r\nsubstance in a glass tube, and apply heat to it. Vapour will be formed,\r\nand will condense at the cool end of the tube. The sublimate of sulphur\r\nis called “Flowers of Sulphur,” and that of perchloride of mercury\r\n“Corrosive Sublimate.”\r\n\r\nDistillation is a more useful process, or, at any rate, one more\r\nfrequently employed, and is used to separate a volatile body from\r\nsubstances not volatile. A distilling apparatus (_distillo_, to drop)\r\nconverts a liquid to vapour by means of heat, and then condenses it by\r\ncold in a separate vessel.\r\n\r\nThe distilling apparatus consists of three parts,—the vessel in which\r\nthe liquid is heated (the still, or retort), the condenser, and the\r\nreceiver. The simple retort and receiver are shown in fig. 81. But when\r\nvery volatile vapours are dealt with, the arrangement shown on next\r\npage is used (fig. 82). Then the vapour passes into the tube encased\r\nin a larger one, the intervening space being filled with cold water\r\nfrom the tap above (_c_), the warm water dropping from _g_. The vapours\r\nare thus condensed, and drop into the bottle (or receiver) B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.—Distilling apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for distilling spirits is shown below. The “still”\r\nA is fitted into a furnace, and communicates with a worm\r\nO in a metal cylinder filled with water, kept constantly\r\nrenewed through the tube TT′. This spirit passes through the\r\nspiral, and being condensed, goes out into the receiver C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.—Spirit still.]\r\n\r\nThere are even more simple apparatus for spirit distilling, but the\r\ndiagram above will show the principle of all “stills.” In former days,\r\nin Ireland, whiskey was generally procured illegally by these means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n SPECIFIC HEAT—FUSION—LATENT HEAT—CONDUCTION AND CONVECTION OF\r\n HEAT—CALORESCENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have considered the effects of heat upon water, and touched upon one\r\nor two kindred experiments. But we have some other subjects to discuss,\r\ntwo in particular; viz., _Specific Heat_, and _Latent Heat_.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of any substance is “the number of units of heat\r\nrequired to raise one pound of such substance one degree.” We can\r\nexplain this farther. When heat is communicated to a body it has two or\r\nthree functions to perform. Some of it has to overcome the resistance\r\nof the air in expanding the body, more of it expands, and the remainder\r\nincreases the temperature of the body. So some heat disappears as\r\nheat, and is turned into energy,—“molecular potential energy,”—as it\r\nis called, and the rest remains. Of course in objects the molecules\r\nvary very much in weight and in their mutual attraction, and the heat\r\nrequisite to raise equal weights of different substances through\r\nthe same number of degrees of temperature will vary. This is called\r\ncapacity for heat, or specific heat. The capacity of different metals\r\nfor heat can easily be shown. The specific heat of water is very high,\r\nbecause its capacity for heat is great. We can cool a hot iron in very\r\nlittle water, and it takes thirty times as much heat to raise a given\r\nweight of water a certain number of degrees, as it would to raise the\r\nsame weight of mercury to the same temperature. Water has greater\r\nspecific heat, generally speaking, than other bodies, and it is owing\r\nto this circumstance that the climate is so affected by ocean currents.\r\n\r\nNearly all substances can be melted by heat, if we go far enough, or\r\nfrozen, if we could take the heat away. Solid can be made liquid, and\r\nthese liquids can be made gases and fly off in vapour. Similarly, if\r\nwe could only get heat away sufficiently from the atoms of a substance\r\nwe could freeze it. We cannot freeze alcohol, nor make ice from\r\nair, nor can we liquify it, for we are unable to take away its heat\r\nsufficiently. But we can turn water into steam, and into ice; or ice\r\ninto water, and then into steam. But there is one body we cannot melt\r\nby heat, that is carbon. In the hottest fire coal will not melt, it\r\nbecomes soft. We call this melting _fusion_, and every body has its\r\nmelting point, or fusing point, which is the same at all times if the\r\nair pressure be the same.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that when a body is melting it rises to a certain\r\ntemperature (its fusing point), and then gets no hotter, no matter\r\nwhether or not the fire be increased;—all the extra heat goes to melt\r\nthe remainder of the substance. The heat only produces _changes of\r\nstate_. So this heat above fusing point disappears apparently, and is\r\ncalled _Latent Heat_. This can easily be proved by melting ice. Ice\r\nmelts at 32° Fahr., or 0° Cent., and at that temperature it will remain\r\nso long as any ice is left; but the water at 32°, into which the ice\r\nhas melted, contains a great deal of _latent_ heat, for it has melted\r\nthe ice quickly, and yet the thermometer does not show it. It is just\r\nthe same with boiling water.\r\n\r\nWhen substances are fused they expand as a rule, but ice contracts;\r\nso does antimony. On the other hand, when water solidifies it does\r\nnot contract as most things do. It expands, as many of us are aware,\r\nby finding our water pipes burst in the winter; and the geologist\r\nwill tell us how the tiny trickling rills of water fall in between\r\nthe cracks of rocks and there freeze. In freezing the drops expand\r\nand split the granite blocks. Type-metal expands also when it becomes\r\nsolid, and leaves us a clear type; but copper contracts, and won’t do\r\nfor moulding, so we have to stamp it when we want an impression on it.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that chemical combinations produce heat, as we can\r\nsee every day in house-building operations, when water is poured upon\r\nlime; but there are also chemical combinations which produce cold.\r\nFahrenheit produced his greatest cold by combining snow and salt, for\r\nin the act of combining, a great quantity of heat is swallowed up by\r\nreason of the heat becoming latent, as it will do when solid bodies\r\nbecome liquid. Such mixtures or combinations are used as _Freezing\r\nMixtures_ when it is necessary to produce intense cold artificially.\r\nSulphate of Sodium and Hydrochloric acid will also produce great cold,\r\nand there are many other combinations equally or even more efficacious.\r\n\r\nHeat is communicated to surrounding objects in three well-known\r\nways—by conduction, by radiation, and by convection. Conduction of\r\nheat is easily understood, and is the propagation of heat through\r\nany body, and it varies very much according to the substance through\r\nwhich it passes. Some substances are better conductors of heat than\r\nothers. Silver has a far greater conductivity than gold, and copper\r\nis a better heat-conductor than tin. Flannel is a non-conductor, or\r\nrather a bad conductor, for no substance can be termed actually a\r\nnon-conductor. Flannel, we know, will keep ice from melting, and a\r\nsheep’s wool or a bird’s feathers are also bad conductors of heat; so\r\nNature has provided these coverings to keep in the animal heat of the\r\nbody. A good conductor of heat feels cold to the touch of our fingers,\r\nbecause it takes the heat from our hands. This can be tried by touching\r\nsilver, lead, marble, wood, and wool. Each in turn will feel cold and\r\nless cold, because they respectively draw away, or conduct less and\r\nless heat from our bodies. So our clothes are made of bad-conducting\r\nsubstances. The bark of a tree is a bad conductor, and if you strip off\r\nthis clothing the tree will die.\r\n\r\nSolids conduct heat the better the more compact they are. Air being a\r\nbad conductor it follows that the less tightly the molecules are packed\r\nthe less conductibility there will be; and even a substance powdered\r\nwill be a worse conductor than the same substance in solid form; and\r\nalso more readily in the direction of the fibres than crossways.\r\n\r\nLiquids do not possess great conductivity, but they, as well as gases,\r\nare influenced by _convection_, or the transport of heat from the\r\nbottom layers to the top (_conveho_, to carry up). We have already\r\nmentioned that the heated particles of water rise to the top because\r\nthey expand, and so become lighter. This is convection of heat; and\r\nby it liquids and gases, though actually bad conductors, may become\r\nheated throughout to a uniform temperature. Of course the more easily\r\nexpansible the body is the more rapidly will convection take place—so\r\ngases are more readily affected than liquids. Solids are not affected,\r\nbecause convection of heat depends upon molecular movement or mobility,\r\nand it is obvious that the particles of solid bodies are not mobile.\r\nProfessor Balfour Stewart says with reference to this that “were there\r\nno gravity there would be no convection,” for the displacement of\r\nthe light warm particles by the heavier cold ones is due to gravity.\r\nThe instances of convection of heat in nature are numerous, and on a\r\ngigantic scale. The ocean currents, trade winds, lake freezing, etc.,\r\nwhile the chimney draught already referred to, is another example;\r\nand in all these cases the particles of air or water are replaced by\r\nconvection. In the case of the lake freezing the cold particles at\r\nthe top sink, and the warmer ones ascend, until all the lake is at a\r\ntemperature of 36·2°, or say 4° above freezing. At this temperature\r\nwater assumes its maximum density, and then _expands_, as we have seen,\r\ninstead of contracting. Ice is formed, and being thus lighter than\r\nwater, floats; and so unites to cover in the water underneath, which is\r\nnever frozen solid, because the cold of the atmosphere cannot reach it\r\nthrough the ice in time to solidify the whole mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.—Radiant heat.]\r\n\r\nRadiant heat is the motion of heat transmitted to the ether, and\r\nthrough it in the form of waves. The sun’s heat is radiant heat, and\r\nradiation may be defined as “The communication of the motion of heat\r\nfrom the articles of a heated substance to the ether.” The fire gives\r\nout radiant heat, and so does heated metal, and it is transmitted by an\r\nunseen medium. It is quite certain that the heat of a suspended red-hot\r\npoker is not communicated to the air, because it will cool equally in\r\na vacuum. Sir Humphrey Davy proved that radiant heat could traverse a\r\nvacuum, for by putting tin reflectors in an exhausted receiver he found\r\nthat a hot substance in the focus of one reflector caused an increase\r\nin the heat of the other. If we put a red-hot or a hot substance in\r\none reflector, and tinder in the other, the latter will take fire.\r\nThe velocity of heat rays is equal to that of light, 186,000 miles in\r\na second, and indeed, radiant heat is identical with light. Heat is\r\nreflected as is light, and is refracted in the same way as sound.\r\n\r\nSome bodies allow the heat rays to pass through them, as air does, and\r\nas rock salt will do. White clothing is preferable in summer (and also\r\nin winter if we could only make people believe it). White garments\r\nradiate less heat in winter, and absorb less heat in summer. An old\r\nblack kettle will boil water more quickly than a new bright one, but\r\nthe latter will keep the water hotter for the longer time when not on\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nHeat, then, is movement of particles. Energy can be changed into heat,\r\nas the savage finds when he rubs the bits of wood to produce heat and\r\nfire. Friction causes heat, and chemical combination produces heat;\r\nand, if “visible energy can be turned into heat, heat can be turned\r\nback into visible energy.” For fire heats water, water expands into\r\nsteam, and steam produces motion and energy in the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nIf we heat water in Wollaston’s bulb,—the opening of which is\r\nhermetically stopped by a piston,—the vapour will raise the piston. If\r\nwe cool the bulb we condense the steam, and the piston falls. Here we\r\nhave the principle of the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nSTEAM is the vapour of water educed by heat, and we may\r\ngive a few particulars concerning it. Its mechanical properties are\r\nthe same as those of other gases, and pure steam is colourless and\r\ntransparent—in fact, invisible. Its power when confined in boilers\r\nand subjected to pressure is enormous, for the volume of the steam is\r\nfar greater than the water which gave rise to it. One cubic inch of\r\nwater will produce 1,700 cubic inches of steam—in other words, a cubic\r\ninch of water produces a cubic foot of steam. When we obtain steam at\r\n212°, we do so under the pressure of one atmosphere; but by increasing\r\nthe pressure we can raise the boiling point, and thus water at the\r\npressures of sixteen atmospheres will not steam till it reaches 398°.\r\nIt is thus we obtain pressure for locomotives, and other engines,\r\nalthough a very small portion of the steam does work. Much the largest\r\nportion is expended in overcoming cohesion, and one way and another,\r\ntaking into consideration defects in machinery, only about one-tenth of\r\nthe heat is employed in doing the work. The force exercised by steam\r\nunder atmospheric pressure is sufficient to raise a ton weight one foot.\r\n\r\nTo obtain very high temperatures we shall find the thermometer of no\r\nuse, for mercury boils at 662°, so an instrument called a Pyrometer\r\nis used to ascertain the fusing point of metals. Mr. Wedgwood, the\r\ncelebrated china manufacturer, invented an instrument made of small\r\ncylinders of clay moulded and backed, placed between two brass rods\r\nas gauges divided into inches and tenths. But this instrument has\r\nbeen long superseded by Professor Daniell’s Pyrometer, which consists\r\nof a small bar of platina in an earthenware tube. The difference of\r\nexpansion between the platina and the tube is measured on a scale on\r\nwhich one degree is equal to seven degrees of Fahrenheit. Thus the\r\nmelting temperatures of metals are ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe reflection and refraction of heat are ruled by the same laws as\r\nthe reflection and refraction of light. A convex lens will bring the\r\nheat or light to a focus, and will act as a burning-glass if held in\r\nthe sunlight. Gunpowder has been ignited by a lens of ice, and more\r\nthan one house has been mysteriously set on fire at midday in summer\r\nby the sun’s rays shining through a glass globe of water containing\r\ngold fish, and falling upon some inflammable substance. Professor\r\nTyndall performed a series of experiments of a very interesting nature,\r\ndescribed in his book, “Heat considered as a Mode or Motion,” and\r\nshowed the transmutation of invisible heat rays into visible rays,\r\nby passing a beam of electric light through an opaque solution, and\r\nconcentrating it upon a lens. The dark heat rays were thus brought to\r\na focus, all the light was cut off, and at the dark focus the heat was\r\nfound to be intense enough to melt copper and explode gunpowder. This\r\nchange of invisible heat into light is termed Calorescence.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir William Herschell who discovered that there were heat\r\nrays beyond the red end of the spectrum. When light is split up into\r\nits component rays, or decomposed, Sir William found that the heat\r\nincreased as the thermometer passed from violet to indigo, and so on\r\nto blue, green, orange, and red, and the last were the hottest, while\r\nbeyond the spectrum there was heat even greater. A _Heat Spectrum_\r\nwas thus discovered, and by comparing, by means of the thermometer,\r\nthe various degrees of heat within certain limits, Professor Tyndall\r\nfound that the invisible Heat Spectrum is longer than the visible Light\r\nSpectrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n LIGHT AND ITS SOURCES—WHAT IS LIGHT?—VELOCITY OF LIGHT—REFLECTION AND\r\n REFRACTION—RELATIVE VALUE OF LIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of Light and the science of Optics are so interesting to\r\nall of us that some short history of light is necessary before we can\r\nenter upon the scientific portion of the subject. The nature of the\r\nagent (as we may term light) upon which our sight depends has employed\r\nman’s mind from a very early period. The ancients were of opinion that\r\nthe light proceeded _from_ the eye to the object looked at. But they\r\ndiscovered some of the properties of light. Ptolemy of Alexandria, who\r\nwas born A.D. 70, made some attempts to discover the law of\r\nRefraction; and we are informed that Archimedes set the Roman fleet\r\non fire with burning-glasses at Syracuse. The Arabian treatise of\r\nAlhagen, in 1100 A.D., contains a description of the eye and\r\nits several parts; and the writer notices refraction and the effects of\r\nmagnifying glasses (or spectacles). Galen, the physician, practically\r\ndiscovered the principle of the stereoscope, for he laid down the law\r\nthat our view of a solid body is made up of two pictures seen by each\r\neye separately.\r\n\r\nStill the science of optics made little progress till the law\r\ndetermining the path of a ray of light was made known, and the laws\r\nof refraction discovered. Refraction means that a ray is deflected\r\nfrom its straight course by its passage from one transparent medium\r\nto another of different density. The old philosophers found out the\r\ntheory of sound, and they applied themselves to light. Newton said\r\nlight consisted of minute particles emanating from luminous bodies.\r\nHuyghens and Euler opposed Newton’s theory of the emission of light;\r\nand it was not till the celebrated Thomas Young, Professor at the Royal\r\nInstitution, grappled with the question that the undulating or wave\r\ntheory of light was found out. He based his investigations upon the\r\ntheory of sound waves; and we know that heat, light, and sound are most\r\nwonderfully allied in their manner of motion by vibration. But he was\r\nridiculed, and his work temporarily suppressed by Mr. Brougham.\r\n\r\nLight, then, is a vibratory motion (like sound and heat), a motion\r\nof the atoms of our ether. But how is the motion transmitted? Sound\r\nhas its medium, air; and in a vacuum sounds will be very indistinctly\r\nheard, if heard at all. But what is the medium of communication of\r\nlight? It is decided that light is transmitted through a medium called\r\n_ether_, a very elastic substance surrounding us. The vibrations,\r\nProfessor Tyndall and other philosophers tell us, of the luminous\r\natoms are communicated to this ether, or propagated through it in\r\nwaves; these waves enter the pupil of the eye, and strike upon the\r\nretina. The motion is thus communicated by the optic nerve to the\r\nbrain, and then arises the great primary faculty, Consciousness. We see\r\nlight, the waves of which, or ether vibrations, are transversal; air\r\nwaves or sound vibrations are longitudinal.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of radiant heat. Light acts in the same way through the\r\nether; and when we consider Sound we shall learn that a certain number\r\nof vibrations of a string give a certain sound, and the quicker the\r\nvibration the shriller the tone. So in light. The more quickly the\r\nwaves of luminosity travel to our eye, and the faster they strike it,\r\nthe greater the difference in the _colour_, or what we call colour.\r\nLight as we see it is composed of different colours, as visible in\r\nthe rainbow. There are seven primary colours in the sunlight, which\r\nis white. These can be divided or “dispersed,” and the shortest rays\r\nof the spectrum are found to be violet, the longest red. It has been\r\ncalculated that 39,000 red waves make an inch in length. Light travels\r\nat a rate of nearly 190,000 miles a second, so if we multiply the\r\nnumber of inches in that distance by the number of red waves, we shall\r\nhave millions of millions of waves entering the eye in a single second\r\nof time. The other waves enter more rapidly still, and “the number of\r\nshocks corresponding to the impression of violet is seven hundred and\r\neighty-nine millions of millions” per second! Or taking the velocity\r\nof light at 186,000 miles in a second, it would be six hundred and\r\nseventy-eight millions of millions (Tyndall). There may be other\r\ncolours which we cannot see because the impressions come too rapidly\r\nupon the retina; but the violet impression has been thus accurately\r\ndetermined. See page 168.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that heat is a kind of motion of particles in a body—a\r\nvibratory motion which, instead of being apparent to the ear, is\r\napparent to the eye in rays of light. Thus heat, sound, and light are\r\nall intimately connected in this way. We have also learnt that rays of\r\nlight radiate and travel with tremendous speed to our eyes, but without\r\nany shock. There is no feeling connected with the entrance of light to\r\nthe eye any more than there is any sensation of sound when entering the\r\near, except when the light is vividly and very suddenly revealed, or\r\nwhen a very piercing sound is heard. Then the nerves are excited, and\r\na painful sensation is the result; but under ordinary circumstances we\r\nare not physically conscious of the entrance of light or sound.\r\n\r\nHeat and light are considered to be one and the same thing in different\r\ndegrees of intensity. The sources of light are various. The sun and\r\nfixed stars, heat, electricity, many animals, and some plants, as well\r\nas decaying animal matter, give out light. There are luminous and\r\nnon-luminous bodies. The moon is non-luminous, as she derives her light\r\nfrom the sun, as does the earth, etc.\r\n\r\nLight is distributed in rays. These rays are straight in all\r\ndirections. The velocity of light is almost inconceivable. It travels\r\nat a rate of 186,500 miles a second. The latest computation with\r\nelectric light has given a rate of 187,200 miles a second; but the blue\r\nrays in the light experimented on probably account for the difference,\r\nfor blue rays travel quicker by one per cent. than red rays. Römer\r\nfirst found out the velocity of light, which comes to us from the\r\nsun—ninety millions of miles—in eight minutes. Fizeau calculated the\r\nvelocity by means of a wheel, which was set moving with tremendous\r\nspeed by making the light pass between the teeth of the wheel and back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen rays of light meet substances they are deflected, and the\r\nphenomena under these circumstances are somewhat similar to the\r\nphenomena of heat and sound. There are three particular conditions of\r\nrays of light: (1) they are absorbed; (2) they are reflected; (3) they\r\nare refracted.\r\n\r\nFirstly. Let us see what we mean by light being absorbed; and this is\r\nnot difficult to understand, for any “black” substance shows us at once\r\nthat all the sunlight is taken in by the black object, and does not\r\ncome out again. It does not take in the light and radiate it, as it\r\nmight heat. The rose is red, because the rays of light pass through it,\r\nand certain of them are reflected from within. So colour may be stated\r\nto be the rays thrown out by the objects themselves—those they reject\r\nor reflect being the “colour” of the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.—Angle of reflection, etc.]\r\n\r\nSecondly. Bodies which reflect light very perfectly are known as\r\nmirrors, and they are termed plane, concave, or convex mirrors,\r\naccording to form. A plane mirror reflects so that the reflected ray _d\r\ni_ forms the same angle with the perpendicular as the incident ray _r\r\ni_; in other words, the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle\r\nof reflection, and these rays are perpendicular to the plane from which\r\nthey are reflected. The rays diverge, so that they appear to come from\r\na point as far behind the mirror as the luminous point is in front, and\r\nthe images reflected have the same appearance, but reversed. There is\r\nanother law, which is that “the angular velocity of a beam reflected\r\nfrom a mirror is twice that of the mirror.” The Kaleidoscope, with\r\nwhich we are all familiar, is based upon the fact of the multiplication\r\nof images by two mirrors inclining towards each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.—Concave mirror.]\r\n\r\nA concave mirror is seen in the accompanying diagram, and may be called\r\nthe segment of a hollow sphere—V W. The point C is the geometrical\r\ncentre, and O C the radius; F is the focus; the line passing through it\r\nis the _optical_ axis; O being the _optical centre_. All perpendicular\r\nrays pass through C. All rays falling in a direction parallel with the\r\noptical axis are reflected and collected at F. Magnified images will\r\nbe produced, and if the object be placed between the mirror and the\r\nfocus, the image will appear at the back; while if the object be placed\r\nbetween the geometrical centre and the focus, the image will appear to\r\nbe in front of the mirror.\r\n\r\nWe can understand these phenomena by the accompanying diagrams. Suppose\r\na ray A _n_ passes from one object, A B, at right angles, it will be\r\nreflected as _n_ A C, the ray A C being reflected to F. These cannot\r\nmeet in front of the mirror, but they will if produced meet at _a_,\r\nand the point A will be reflected there; similarly B will be reflected\r\nat _b_, and thus a magnified image will appear behind or at the back\r\nof the mirror’s surface. In the next diagram the second supposed case\r\nwill produce the image in the air at _a b_, and if a sheet of paper be\r\nheld so that the rays are intercepted, the image will be visible on the\r\nsheet. In this case the perpendicular ray, A _n_, is reflected in the\r\nsame direction, and the ray, _a c_, parallel with the axis is reflected\r\nto the focus. These rays meet at _a_ and corresponding rays at _b_,\r\nwhen the image will be reproduced; viz., in front of the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.—Reflection of mirrors (I).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.—Reflection of mirrors (II).]\r\n\r\nThe concave mirror is used in the manufacture of telescopes, which,\r\nwith other optical instruments, will be described in their proper\r\nplaces. We will now look at the _Refraction_ of light.\r\n\r\nBodies which permit rays of light to pass through them are termed\r\ntransparent. Some possess this property more than others, and so\r\nlong as the light passes through the same medium the direction will\r\nremain the same. But if a ray fall upon a body of a different degree\r\nof density it cannot proceed in the same direction, and it will be\r\nbroken or _refracted_, the angle it makes being termed the angle of\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a straight stick when plunged into water appears to be\r\nbroken at the point of immersion. This appearance is caused by the rays\r\nof light taking a different direction to our eyes. If in the diagram\r\n(fig. 89) our eye were at _o_, and the vessel were empty, we should\r\nnot see _m_; but when water is poured into the vessel the object will\r\nappear higher up at _n_, and all objects under water appear higher than\r\nthey really are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.—Refraction in water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.—A water-bottle employed as a convergent lens.]\r\n\r\nOne may also place a piece of money at the bottom of a basin, and then\r\nstoop down gradually, until, the edge of the basin intervening, the\r\ncoin is lost to view. If an operator then fills the basin with water,\r\nthe piece of money appears as though the bottom had been raised. The\r\nglass lenses used by professors may be very well replaced by a round\r\nwater-bottle full of water. A candle is lighted in the darkness, and\r\non holding the bottle between the light and a wall which acts as a\r\nscreen, we see the reflected light turned upside down by means of\r\nthe convergent lens we have improvised (fig. 90). A balloon of glass\r\nconstitutes an excellent microscope. It must be filled with perfectly\r\nclear, limpid water, and closed by means of a cork. A piece of wire\r\nis then rolled round its neck, and one end is raised, and turned up\r\ntowards the focus; viz., to support the object we wish to examine,\r\nwhich is magnified several diameters. If a fly, for instance, is at the\r\nend of the wire, we find it is highly magnified when seen through the\r\nglass balloon (fig. 91). By examining the insect through the water in\r\nthe balloon, we can distinguish every feature of its organism, thanks\r\nto this improvised magnifier. This little apparatus may also serve to\r\nincrease the intensity of a luminous focus of feeble power, such as a\r\nlighted candle. It is often employed in this manner by watchmakers. If\r\na bottle full of water is placed on a table, and exposed to the rays\r\nof the sun, the head of a lucifer match being placed in the brightest\r\ncentre of light caused by the refracted rays, the match will not fail\r\nto ignite. I have succeeded in this experiment even under an October\r\nsun, and still more readily in warm weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.—A simple microscope formed with a glass balloon\r\nfull of water.]\r\n\r\nIn the Conservatoire des Arts in Paris a visitor will always notice\r\na number of people looking at the mirrors in the “optical” cabinets.\r\nThese mirrors deform and distort objects in a very curious manner, and\r\npeople find much amusement in gazing into them till they are “moved on”\r\nby the attendants. Such experiments create great interest, and a very\r\nexcellent substitute for these may be found in a coffee-pot or even in\r\na large spoon, and all the grotesque appearance will be seen in the\r\npolished surface. The least costly apparatus will sometimes produce\r\nthe most marvellous effects. Look at a soap-bubble blown from the end\r\nof a straw. When the sphere has a very small diameter the pellicule\r\nis colourless and transparent; but as the air enters by degrees,\r\npressing upon all parts of the concave surface equally, the bubble gets\r\nbigger as the thickness decreases, and then the colours appear,—feeble\r\nat first, but stronger and stronger as the thickness diminishes.\r\nThe study of soap-bubbles and of the effects of the light is very\r\ninteresting. Newton made the soap-bubble the object of his studies\r\nand meditations, and it will ever hold its place amongst the curious\r\nphenomena of the Science of Optics. But before going into all the\r\nphases of Lights and Optics we will proceed to explain the structure of\r\nthe eye, as it is through that organ that we are enabled to appreciate\r\nlight and its marvellous effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.—Grotesque effects of curved surfaces.]\r\n\r\nIt is often considered an embarrassing matter to fix precisely the\r\nvalue of two lights. Nothing, however, can be easier in reality, as\r\nwe will show. In comparing different lights, it is necessary to bear\r\nin mind the amount of waste, the colour of the light, the luminous\r\nvalue of the source, and the steadiness of the flame. The luminous\r\nvalue of a lamp-burner is generally equalled by that of a wax candle,\r\nand we will take as an example one of those at six to the pound. Very\r\nprecise appliances are used for this experiment when great exactness\r\nis required; but it is easy to calculate in a simple manner the\r\ndifferences in ordinary lights. Supposing we desire to test the value\r\nof light given by a lamp and a wax candle, they must both be placed\r\non the table at an equal height, B and A, (fig. 93), in front of some\r\nopaque body, A, and then a large sheet of paper must be fixed as\r\nvertically as possible to form a screen. When B and A are lighted,\r\ntwo shadows, E and F, are produced, to which it is easy to give\r\nexactly the same intensity, by advancing or withdrawing one of the\r\ntwo sources of light. The intensities of the two lights will then be\r\ninversely proportional to the squares of the measured distances, AB\r\nand AC. By a similar careful calculation it has been possible to draw\r\nup a table of the relative values of various ordinary lights. We have\r\nnot included here the electric light, which has recently attracted so\r\nmuch attention, because this system of lighting can hardly be said to\r\nhave yet penetrated the domain of domestic life; but when we consider\r\nelectricity, as we hope to do in a future part, we intend to study\r\nthis question fully, for there is no doubt that electricity is becoming\r\nmore and more adapted to our daily life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.—An elementary Photometer.]\r\n\r\nThe measurement of intensity of light is called _Photometry_, and the\r\ninstruments used are _Photometers_. Bunsen’s instrument consists of a\r\nscreen of writing-paper, saturated in places with spermaceti to make it\r\ntransparent. A sperm candle is placed on one side, and the light to be\r\ncompared on the other. The lights are provided with graduated bars, and\r\nthese lights are then removed farther and farther from the screen till\r\nthe spots of grease are invisible. The relative intensities are as the\r\nsquares of the distance from the screen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.—The soap-bubble.]\r\n\r\nWe append a table showing the comparative cost of light given by Dr.\r\nFrankland at the Royal Institution some few years ago.

It was Kepler who at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury discovered the passage of light into the eye. Soon after the\r\ndiscovery of the inner chamber he found that the eye realized the\r\nconditions that Porta had combined to obtain the reflection of external\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly state that the coats of this organ are constituted\r\nof a fibrous membrane, T (fig. 95), termed _sclerotic_, which\r\nis opaque, except in the anterior portion of the eye, where it forms\r\nthe transparent _cornea_. The crystalline, C, enshrined\r\nbehind the cornea, is the convergent lens of the inner chamber; it is\r\ncovered with a transparent membrane, or _capsule_, and is bathed in two\r\nfluids, the _aqueous humour_, between the crystalline humour and the\r\ncornea, and the _vitreous body_, a gelatinous humour lodged between\r\nthe crystalline and the back of the eye. The image of exterior objects\r\nwhich is produced by the passage of light through these refracting\r\nsurfaces, is received by a nervous membrane, the _retina_, B,\r\nformed by an expansion of the optic nerve, N. We must also\r\nmention the _choroid_, a membrane lined with a dark pigment, which\r\nabsorbs the light, and prevents interior reflections, and in front of\r\nthe crystalline lens, a curtain with an opening, H, called the\r\n_iris_, which gives to the eyes their colour of blue, grey, or black.\r\nThe opening in the centre of the iris is called the _pupil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.—Structure of the eye.]\r\n\r\nThe penetration of light through the surfaces of the eye is easily\r\ndemonstrated. An object throws divergent rays on the cornea, a part\r\npenetrates into the eye and falls upon the retina, leaving a perfectly\r\nretained image of the object. Magendie has proved in the following\r\nmanner the truth of this mathematical deduction. The eye of a rabbit\r\nis very similar to an albino’s; that is to say, the choroid contains\r\nno black pigment, but a transparent matter, and when placed before a\r\nbrilliant object, the image can be seen inverted on the retina. The\r\nexperiment succeeds also with the eye of a sheep or a cow, if the\r\nsclerotic has been lessened. The _optic centre_ of the eye is the point\r\nwhere the secondary axes cross; the _optic axis_ passes through the\r\ngeometrical axis of the organ, and directs itself spontaneously towards\r\nthe point that attracts the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.—Diagram of mode of vision.]\r\n\r\nWe will now point out in what distinct vision consists. A screen\r\nplaced behind a lens will only receive the image of a lighted object,\r\nA B, if placed in a position, R R (fig. 96). If placed nearer at R´´\r\nR´´, or further off at R´ R´, the light from the object is thrown on\r\nthe screen, and the image is confused. To prove the imperfection of\r\nsight which is shown by the application of these theoretic rules, MM.\r\nBoutan and d’Alméïda[10] cite the following experiment:—If the head of\r\na pin is placed from one to two inches from the eye, nothing will be\r\nperceived but a confused haziness of vague outline. The distance of\r\ndistinct vision is that at which an object of small dimensions may be\r\nplaced to be plainly perceived. This distance, which averages fifteen\r\ninches, varies with different individuals. It can be determined for\r\ndifferent sights by means of an apparatus constructed by Lepot. A white\r\nthread, _a_, is stretched horizontally on a dark board (fig. 97). We\r\nlook at it by placing our eye at one end behind a little screen pierced\r\nwith an aperture, O; it then appears much reduced in length, but\r\neither nearer or farther off it seems to enlarge and swell, having the\r\nappearance of a white surface, becoming larger and larger in proportion\r\nas we move away from the point at which it is seen most distinctly. In\r\nthis manner we can easily obtain a measure of the distance of distinct\r\nvision. One of the most remarkable properties of the eye consists in\r\nthe faculty which this organ possesses of seeing different distances.\r\nIf we consider it as a dark chamber, there is but one distance at which\r\nan object will be perfectly visible; nevertheless a metal wire, for\r\nexample, can be seen as well at a distance of seven, as ten, fifteen,\r\nor twenty inches by good sights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.—Experiment for sight.]\r\n\r\nThis faculty of accommodation in the eye is thus demonstrated: we place\r\ntwo pins, one in front of the other, one eye only being open; we first\r\nlook at the nearest pin, which appears confused if it is near the eye,\r\nbut by an effort of will the image becomes clear. If, while preserving\r\nthe clearness of the image, we then carry our attention to the second\r\npin, we find that it, too, presents a confused appearance. If we make\r\nan effort to distinguish the contour of the second pin, we at last\r\nsucceed, and the first once more appears ill-defined. It is only since\r\nthe experiments of M. Cramer and M. Helmholtz that the explanation\r\nof this phenomenon could have been given. M. Cramer has succeeded in\r\ndetermining on the living eye the curved ray of the cornea, and of the\r\ntwo surfaces of the crystalline lens. In so doing he followed Samson’s\r\nmethod, and observed the images thrown by a luminous object, whose\r\nrays strike the different refracting surfaces of the eye. A candle,\r\nL (fig. 98), is placed before the eye, O, and throws as in a convex\r\nmirror a straight image of the flame, A (fig. 99). The other portion\r\nof the light, which has penetrated the pupil, falls on the crystalline\r\nlens, and produces likewise a second straight image, B. Then the light\r\nrefracted by the lens reaches the posterior surface; a portion is\r\nreflected on a concave mirror, and gives the inverted image, C, very\r\nsmall and brilliant. M. Cramer observed it through a microscope, and\r\nstudied the variations in the size of images when the eye passed from\r\nthe observation of adjacent to distant objects. He stated:—\r\n\r\n1. That the image, A, formed on the surface of the cornea,\r\nremains the same size in both cases; the form of the cornea therefore\r\nremains unaltered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.—M. Cramer’s experiment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.—Images in the eye.]\r\n\r\n2. That the image, B, formed on the upper surface of the\r\nlens, diminishes in proportion as the eye is nearer the object; the\r\nsurface therefore becoming more and more convex, as the focal distance\r\ndiminishes—a result indicated by the theory that it is possible in the\r\nvision of near objects to receive the image on the retina.\r\n\r\n3. That the third image, C, produced on the posterior surface\r\nof the lens, remains nearly invariable.\r\n\r\nWe may confirm Cramer’s statements by an easy experiment. We place\r\nourselves in front of the eye of someone who looks in turn at two\r\nobjects placed on the same black line at unequal distances from\r\nhim, and are able to distinguish by the dimension of the images of\r\nthe candle, which object it is that he is regarding. M. Helmholtz\r\nhas carried M. Cramer’s methods to perfection, and has been able to\r\nformulate a complete theory of all the phenomena of accommodation.\r\nThe laws of optics show that the rays emitted by a luminous point may\r\nunite at another point by the action of the refracting surfaces of the\r\neye. Nevertheless, a white light being composed of rays of diverse\r\nrefrangibility, particular effects, known under the name of _chromatic\r\naberration_, are produced through the decomposition of light, which\r\nwe will proceed to study, under M. Helmholtz’s auspices[11]. We make\r\na narrow opening in a screen, and fix behind this opening a violet\r\nglass, penetrable only by red and violet rays. We then place a light,\r\nthe red rays of which reach the eye of the observer after having passed\r\nthrough the glass and the opening in the screen. If the eye is adapted\r\nto the red rays, the violet rays will form a circle of diffusion, and\r\na red point encircled with a violet aureola is seen. The eye may also\r\nbe brought to a state of refraction, so that the point of convergence\r\nof the violet rays is in front, and that of the red rays behind the\r\nretina, the diameters of the red and violet circles of diffusion being\r\nequal. It is then only that the luminous point appears monochromatic.\r\nWhen the eye is in this state of refraction, the simple rays, whose\r\nrefrangibility is maintained between the red and the violet rays, unite\r\non the retina.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of aberration of luminous rays of one colour\r\nemitted through a hole, which generally only approach approximately to\r\na mathematical focus, in consequence of the properties of refracting\r\nsurfaces; it is called _aberration of sphericity_. The phenomena are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\n1. We take for our object a very small luminous point (the hole\r\nmade by a pin in some black paper, through which the light passes),\r\nand having also placed before the eye a convex glass, if we are not\r\nnear-sighted, we fix it a little beyond the point of accommodation, so\r\nthat it produces on the retina a little circle of diffusion. We then\r\nsee, instead of the luminous point, a figure representing from four\r\nto eight irregular rays, which generally differ with both eyes, and\r\nalso with different people. We have given the result of M. Helmholtz’s\r\nobservations in fig. 100; _a_ corresponds to the right eye, and _b_ to\r\nthe left. The outer edges of the luminous parts of an image, produced\r\nin this way by a white light, are bordered with blue; the edges towards\r\nthe centre are of a reddish yellow. The writer adds that the figure\r\nappears to him to have greater length than breadth. If the light is\r\nfeeble, only the most brilliant parts of the figure can be seen, and\r\nseveral images of the luminous point are visible, of which one is\r\ngenerally more brilliant than the others. If, on the other hand, the\r\nlight is very intense,—if, for example, the direct light of the sun\r\npasses through a small opening,—the rays mingle with each other, and\r\nare surrounded by aureola of rays, composed of numberless extremely\r\nfine lines, of all colours, possessing a much larger diameter, and\r\nwhich we distinguish by the name of the aureola of capillary rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.]\r\n\r\nThe radiating form of stars, and the distant light of street-lamps\r\nbelong to the preceding phenomena. If the eye is accommodated to a\r\ngreater distance than that of the luminous point,—and for this purpose,\r\nif the luminous point itself is distant, we place before the eye a\r\nslightly convex lens,—we see another radiating image appear, which M.\r\nHelmholtz represents thus (fig. 101): at _c_ as it is presented to the\r\nright eye, and at _d_ as seen by the left.\r\n\r\nIf the pupil is covered on one side, the side opposite to the image\r\nof diffusion disappears; that is to say, that part of the retinal\r\nimage situated on the same side as the covered half of the pupil. This\r\nfigure, then, is formed by rays which have not yet crossed the axis\r\nof the eye. If we place the luminous point at a distance to which\r\nthe eye can accommodate itself, we see, through a moderate light, a\r\nsmall, round, luminous spot, without any irregularities. If the light,\r\non the contrary, is intense, the image is radiated in every position\r\nof accommodation, and we merely find that on approaching nearer, the\r\nfigure which was elongated, answering to a distant accommodation,\r\ngradually diminishes, grows rounder, and gives place to the vertically\r\nelongated figure, which belongs to the accommodation of a nearer point.\r\nWhen we examine a slender, luminous line, we behold images developed,\r\nwhich are easily foreseen, if for every point of the line we suppose\r\nradiating images of diffusion, which encroach on each other. The\r\nclearest portions of these images of diffusion mingle together and form\r\ndistinct lines, which show multiplied images of the luminous line. Most\r\npersons will see two of these images; some, with the eyes in certain\r\npositions, will see five or six.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\nTo show clearly by experiment the connection existing between double\r\nimages and radiated images from points, it is sufficient to make in a\r\ndark sheet of paper a small rectilinear slit, and at a little distance\r\nfrom one end, on a line with the slit, a small round hole, as shown\r\nat _a_ in fig. 102. Looking at it from a distance we shall see that\r\nthe double images of the line have exactly the same distance between\r\nthem that the most brilliant parts of the starred figure of diffusion\r\nhave from the point, and that the latter are in a line with the first,\r\nas will be seen at _b_ (fig. 102), where in the image of diffusion of\r\nthe luminous point, we only see the clearest parts of star _a_ of the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nOn lighted surfaces, to which the eye is not exactly accommodated,\r\nmultiplied images are often remarked through the passage from light to\r\ndarkness being made by two or three successive steps.\r\n\r\nA series of facts which have been collected under the title of\r\n_irradiation_, and which show that brightly-lighted surfaces\r\nappear larger than they are in reality, and that the dark surfaces\r\nwhich surround them appear diminished to a corresponding degree,\r\nexplains this by the circumstance that the luminous sensation is not\r\nproportional to the intensity of the objective light. These phenomena\r\naffect very various appearances, according to the form of respective\r\nfigures; they are generally seen with the greatest ease and intensity\r\nwhen the eye is not exactly accommodated to the object examined, either\r\nby the eye being too near or too far off, or by using a concave or\r\nconvex lens, which prevents the object being seen clearly. Irradiation\r\nis not completely wanting, even when the accommodation is exact, and\r\nwe notice it clearly in very luminous objects, above all when they are\r\nsmall; small circles of diffusion increase relatively the dimensions\r\nof small objects much more than of large ones, with regard to which,\r\nthe dimensions of the small circles of diffusion which the eye\r\nfurnishes, when properly accommodated, become insensible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.—Experiment 1.]\r\n\r\n1. _Luminous surfaces appear larger._ We can never judge exactly of\r\nthe dimensions of a slit or small hole through which a bright light\r\nescapes; it always appears to us larger than it really is, even with\r\nthe most exact accommodation. Similarly, the fixed stars appear in the\r\nform of small luminous surfaces, even when we make use of a glass which\r\nallows of perfect accommodation. If a gridiron with narrow bars—the\r\nspaces intervening being exactly equal to the thickness of the bars—is\r\nheld over a light surface, the spaces will always appear wider than the\r\nbars. With an inexact accommodation, these phenomena are still more\r\nremarkable. Fig. 103 exhibits a white square on a black foundation, and\r\na black square on a white foundation. Although the two squares have\r\nexactly the same dimensions, the white appears larger than the black,\r\nunless with an intense light and an inexact accommodation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.—Experiment 2.]\r\n\r\n2. _Two adjacent luminous surfaces mingle together._ If we hold a fine\r\nmetallic wire between the eye and the sun, or the light of a powerful\r\nlamp, we shall cease to see it; the lighted surfaces on all sides\r\nof the wire in the visual range pass one into the other, and become\r\nmingled. In objects composed of black and white squares, like those of\r\na draught-board (fig. 104), the angles of the white squares join by\r\nirradiation, and separate the black squares.\r\n\r\n3. _Straight lines appear interrupted._ If a ruler is held between\r\nthe eye and the light of a bright lamp or the sun, we perceive a very\r\ndistinct hollow on the edge of the ruler in the part corresponding to\r\nthe light. When one point of the retina is affected by a light which\r\nundergoes periodical and regular variations, the duration of the period\r\nbeing sufficiently short, there results a continuous impression, like\r\nthat which would be produced if the light given during each period\r\nwere distributed in an equal manner throughout the whole duration of\r\nthe period. To verify the truth of this law, we will make use of some\r\ndiscs, such as that represented in fig. 105. The innermost circle is\r\nhalf white and half black; the middle circle has two quarters, or half\r\nits periphery, white, and the outer circle has four eighths’ white, the\r\nrest being black. If such a disc is turned round, its entire surface\r\nwill appear grey; only it is necessary to turn it with sufficient force\r\nto produce a continuous effect. The white may also be distributed in\r\nother ways, and provided only that on all the circles of the disc the\r\nproportion of the angles covered with white is the same, they will\r\nalways exhibit the same grey colour. Instead of black and white we may\r\nmake use of different colours, and obtain the same resultant colour\r\nfrom all the circles, when the proportion of the angles occupied by\r\neach of the colours in the different circles is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.—Disc which appears uniformly grey by reason of\r\nits rotation.]\r\n\r\nIf we paint on a disc a coloured star, which is detached from a\r\nfoundation of another colour (fig. 106), during the rapid rotation of\r\nthe disc the centre affects the colour of the star; the outer circle\r\nassumes that of the background, and the intermediate parts of the disc\r\npresent the continuous series of the resultant colours. These results\r\nare in accordance with the theory of the mixture of colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.—Disc with a star painted on the background of\r\nanother colour.]\r\n\r\nRotative discs, which are so much used in experiments in optical\r\nphysiology, were employed for the first time by Müsschenbroeck;\r\nthe most simple is the top. M. Helmholtz ordinarily uses a brass\r\nspinning-top, which fig. 107 represents at a third the natural size.\r\nIt is set in motion by the hand, and its quickness may be increased\r\nor moderated at will; but it cannot be made to spin quicker than six\r\nrounds in a second; this motion will be kept up for three or four\r\nminutes. Thus, with a feeble movement of rotation, a uniform luminous\r\nimpression can only be obtained by dividing the disc into four or six\r\nsections, on each of which we repeat the same arrangement of colours,\r\nlight, and shade. If the number of repetitions of the design is less,\r\nwe obtain, with a bright light, a more or less shot-coloured disc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.—M. Helmholtz’s top for studying the impression\r\nof light on the retina.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to place designs on the disc, even when in motion, or to\r\nmake any desired modification, by superposing on the first disc another\r\ndisc with sectors, of which we can vary the position by slightly\r\ntouching it, or even blowing on it, thus producing during the rotation\r\nof the disc very varied modifications. If, for instance, we place on\r\na disc covered with blue and red sectors of equal size, a black disc,\r\nof which the sectors are alternately filled in or empty, the disc, as\r\nit turns round, will appear blue if the black sectors of the upper\r\ndisc exactly cover the [red] sectors of the lower disc; and it appears\r\nred, if, on the contrary, the blue sectors are covered with the black;\r\nwhile in the intermediate positions we obtain different mixtures of\r\nred and white, and during the rotation of the disc may vary the colour\r\ninsensibly by a gentle touch. By dividing the different sectors with\r\nbroken or curved lines, instead of straight ones, we can produce an\r\narrangement of coloured rings of great variety and beauty. To give\r\nthe top greater speed, we set it in motion by drawing a string twined\r\nround its stem. The simplest method, as shown in fig. 108, consists in\r\nthe employment of a handle similar to that of the German top. It is a\r\nhollow cylinder of wood set into a handle with two circular holes; and\r\nat right angles with these is a groove for the passage of the string.\r\nThe stem of the top is passed through the holes of the cylinder, one\r\nend of the string is fixed in the small hole in the stem, and is rolled\r\nround by turning the top in the hand. The part of the stem on which\r\nthe string is twisted becomes sufficiently thick for the top to remain\r\nsuspended to the handle; then holding it a little above the table, and\r\ngiving the string a powerful pull, we set the top in motion, and as\r\nthe string unrolls it falls on the table, where it will continue its\r\nrotation for some time. The top represented in fig. 109 is constructed\r\nso that the discs may be firmly pressed by the stem, which is necessary\r\nin experiments for demonstrating Newton’s theory of the mingling of\r\ncolours. We make use for this purpose of a variety of discs, made of\r\nstrong paper of different sizes, having an opening in the centre and\r\na slit, as in fig. 110; each of the discs is covered uniformly with\r\na single colour; and if two or more are superposed, with their slits\r\nplaced one over the other, we obtain sectors, the size of which we\r\nmay vary at will, so that we can modify in a continuous manner the\r\nproportions of the colours. The most perfect construction is that\r\nof Busold’s chromatic top (fig. 111), which should only be employed\r\nfor very rapid rotations. The disc, which weighs 5 lbs., is made of\r\nan alloy of zinc and lead, about an inch and a quarter in diameter.\r\nThe brass axis terminates at its lower end with a blunt point of\r\nuntempered steel; the cylindrical part of the axis is roughened to\r\nencourage the adherence of the string; the axis is placed between the\r\nclamps of a vice, and a plate is put underneath; we then pull the\r\nstring firmly with the right hand, and when the top is in motion it is\r\nseparated from the clamps. By pulling the string very powerfully it is\r\npossible to obtain a speed of sixty turns in a second, and the movement\r\nwill be kept up for three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.—Spinning a top with coloured discs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.—Top for experiments demonstrating Newton’s\r\ntheory of the mingling of colours.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.—Disc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.—Busold’s chromatic top.]\r\n\r\nBesides tops, we may make use of different kinds of discs, with an\r\naxis rotating between two clamps; they are moved either by a kind of\r\nclock-work, or by the unrolling of a string, like the tops. Generally,\r\nhowever, these contrivances have this inconvenience, that the discs\r\ncannot be changed without stopping the instrument, and partly taking\r\nit to pieces. On the other hand, we have the advantage of being able\r\nto turn them on a vertical plane, so that we can conveniently carry on\r\nour experiments before a numerous auditory, which is a more difficult\r\nmatter with tops. Montigny contrived to obtain the mingling of colours\r\nby means of a turning prism, which he caused to throw its shadow on a\r\nwhite screen. The Thaumatrope is a small rectangle of cardboard, which\r\nis made to rotate on an axis passing through the centres of the longest\r\nsides. We shall describe it at greater length when we come to consider\r\na new apparatus known under the name of the _Praxinoscope_.\r\n\r\nMore complicated contrivances have also been constructed on the same\r\nprinciple, by which one may perceive the rotating disc through slits\r\nwhich turn at the same time. We will now describe the construction of\r\nsome discs invented by Plateau under the name of the Phenakistoscope.\r\nThese discs are made of strong cardboard, from six to ten inches in\r\ndiameter (fig. 112), on which a certain number of figures (eight to\r\ntwelve) are placed in circles at an equal distance from each other,\r\npresenting the successive phases of a periodical movement. This disc\r\nis placed on another opaque circle of rather larger diameter, which\r\nhas on its margin as many openings as the first disc has figures. The\r\ntwo discs are placed one on the other, and are fixed in the centre by\r\nmeans of a screw at the anterior extremity of a small iron axis, the\r\nother end being fitted into a handle. To make use of this contrivance\r\nwe place ourselves in front of the glass, towards which we turn the\r\ndisc with the figures, placing the eye so as to see the figures through\r\none of the holes of the large disc. Directly the apparatus begins\r\nto turn round, the figures seen in the glass appear to execute the\r\nparticular movements which they represent in different positions. Let\r\nus designate by means of the figures 1, 2, 3, the different openings\r\nthrough which the eye successively looks, and point out by the same\r\nnumbers the figures in the radiuses thus numbered. If the experimenter\r\nlooks in the glass through opening 1, he will see first figure 1,\r\nwhich appears in the glass to pass before his eyes; then the rotation\r\nof the disc displaces opening 1, and the cardboard intervenes, until\r\nopening 2 appears; then figure 2 takes the place of figure 1, until it\r\nin turn disappears, and opening 3 presents figure 3 to view. If these\r\nfigures were all similar, the spectator would have but a series of\r\nvisual impressions, separate but alike, which by a sufficiently rapid\r\nrotation mingle together in one durable impression like a perfectly\r\nimmovable object. If, on the contrary, the figures differ slightly\r\nfrom each other, the luminous sensations will also mingle in a single\r\nobject, which will however appear to be modified in a continuous\r\nmanner, conformably with the differences of successive images. With a\r\ndifference of speed, we obtain a new series of phenomena. A most simple\r\ncontrivance of this kind is a top of C. B. Dancer, of Manchester (fig.\r\n113). It will be seen that the axis carries another disc, pierced\r\nwith openings of different shapes, to the edge of which a thread is\r\nattached. This second disc is carried along by the friction of the\r\naxis, but its rotation is less rapid because of the great resistance\r\noffered by the air to the piece of thread which participates in the\r\nmovement. If the lower disc has several differently-coloured sectors,\r\nthey produce a very motley appearance, which seems to move sometimes by\r\nleaps, and sometimes by continuous motion. We must distinguish between\r\nthe phenomena of successive contrast and simultaneous contrast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.—Rotating disc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.—Mr. Dancer’s top.]\r\n\r\nPhenomena of _successive contrast_ develop what are called _accidental\r\nimages_. If we fix our eyes for a considerable time on a coloured\r\nobject, and then suddenly direct them towards a uniform white surface,\r\nwe experience the sensation of the object as it is, but it appears\r\ncoloured with a complementary tint; that is to say, it has the colour\r\nwhich, superposed on the genuine tint, we obtain from pure white. Thus\r\na red object produces a consecutive green object. The experiment can be\r\ntried by gazing at the sun when it is setting, and then directing one’s\r\neyes towards a white wall in the same direction.\r\n\r\nPhenomena of _simultaneous contrast_ arise from the influence\r\nexercised over each other by different shades and colours which we see\r\n_simultaneously_. That we may be certain that we have really obtained\r\nphenomena of this kind, the experiments must be arranged in such a\r\nmanner that accidental images are not produced, and that the part of\r\nthe retina affected by the sensation of colour does not receive, even\r\nmomentarily, a passing image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.—Disc, which exhibits, when in rotation, a\r\nseries of concentric rings.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of simultaneous contrast appear with the greatest\r\nclearness with slight differences of colour, and are therefore exactly\r\nthe contrary of phenomena of successive contrast, which are favoured\r\nby strong oppositions of colour and light. We can, in general,\r\ncharacterise phenomena of simultaneous contrast as governed by this\r\nlaw, common to all perceptions of the senses: _the differences clearly\r\nperceived appear greater than the differences equal to them, but\r\nperceived with greater difficulty, either because they only affect\r\nthe observation in an uncertain manner, or that the memory fails to\r\njudge of them_. A man of middle height appears small beside a tall\r\nman, because at the moment it is forcibly impressed on us that there\r\nare taller men than he, and we lose sight of the fact that there are\r\nsmaller. The same man of medium height appears tall beside a man of\r\nsmall stature. We can easily make experiments on simultaneous contrast\r\nwith a sheet of transparent paper. We fasten together a sheet of green\r\nand a sheet of rose-coloured paper, so as to obtain a sheet half red\r\nand half green. On the line of separation between the two colours we\r\nplace a strip of grey paper, and cover the whole with a sheet of thin\r\nletter-paper of the same size. The grey strip will then appear red at\r\nthe edge touching the green, and green at the edge touching the red;\r\nthe centre presenting an intermediate shade. It presents a still more\r\ndecided appearance if the grey strip is perpendicular with the line\r\nof separation of the two colours; the piece of grey then stretching\r\ninto the green will present as deep a red as the red foundation on\r\nthe other side. If the line of grey colour exactly covers the line of\r\nseparation between the two colours, the contrasting colour is more\r\nfeeble; the edges of the grey paper then present complementary strips\r\nof colour. Similar effects may be obtained by superposing, in gradually\r\ndiminishing layers, strips of thin paper, so as to form successive\r\nbands of different thicknesses. If it is then lit up from behind, the\r\nobjective intensity is evidently constant through the extent of each\r\nlayer; nevertheless every strip appears darker at the edge touching\r\na more transparent layer, and lighter at the edge in contact with a\r\nthicker layer. The dull tints of China ink, superposed in layers,\r\nwill produce a similar effect. The phenomena are produced by means of\r\nrotative discs of most beautiful and delicate gradations of colour. Let\r\nus give the sectors of the disc the form represented by fig. 114, and\r\nmake them black and white; and when in rotation we shall see a series\r\nof concentric rings of a shade that becomes darker and darker towards\r\nthe centre. The angular surface of the dark portions is constant in\r\neach of these rings. The intensity, therefore, of each ring is uniform\r\nduring rapid rotation; it is only between one ring and another that\r\nthe intensity varies. Each ring also appears lighter on its inner\r\nside when it borders on a darker ring, and darker on its outer side\r\nwhen in contact with a lighter ring. If the differences of intensity\r\nin the rings are very slight, one can scarcely judge sometimes if the\r\ninner rings are darker than the outer; the eye is only struck by the\r\nperiodical alternations of light and shade presented by the edges\r\nof the rings. If, instead of white and black, we take two different\r\ncolours, each ring will present two colours on its two edges, although\r\nthe colour of the rest of the ring will be uniform. Each of the\r\nconstituent colours presents itself with more intensity on that edge of\r\nthe ring which borders on another ring containing a smaller quantity of\r\nthe colour. Thus, if we mix blue and yellow, and the blue predominates\r\nin the exterior and the yellow in the interior, every ring will appear\r\nyellow at its outer, and blue at its inner edge; and if the colours\r\npresent together very slight differences, we may fall into the illusion\r\nwhich causes the differences really existing between the colours of the\r\ndifferent rings to disappear, leaving instead, on a uniformly coloured\r\nbackground, the contrasting blue and yellow of the edges of the rings.\r\nIt is very characteristic that in these cases we do not see the mixed\r\ncolours, but seem to see the constituent colours separately, one beside\r\nthe other, and one through the other.\r\n\r\nAll the experiments we have described afford great interest to the\r\nstudent; they can easily be performed by those of our readers who are\r\nparticularly interested in these little-known subjects. Any one may\r\nconstruct the greater part of the appliances we have enumerated, and\r\nothers can be obtained at an optician’s. The discs in particular are\r\nextensively manufactured, and with great success.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] _Traité de Physique_, Paris 1874.\r\n\r\n[11] _Traité d’optique Physiologique._ French translation by MM. Javal\r\nand Klein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n OPTICAL ILLUSIONS—ZOLLNER’S DESIGNS—THE\r\n THAUMATROPE—PHENOKISTOSCOPE—THE ZOOTROPE—THE PRAXINOSCOPE—THE DAZZLING\r\n TOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now continue the subject by describing some illusions more\r\ncurious still—those of _ocular estimation_. These illusions depend\r\nrather on the particular properties of the figures we examine, and the\r\ngreater part of these phenomena may be placed in that category whose\r\nlaw we have just formulated: _the differences clearly perceived appear\r\ngreater than the differences equal to them, but perceived with greater\r\ndifficulty_. Thus a line —— when divided appears greater than when not\r\ndivided; the direct perception of the parts makes us notice the number\r\nof the sub-divisions, the size of which is more perceptible than when\r\nthe parts are not clearly marked off. Thus, in fig. 115, we imagine the\r\nlength _ab_ equals _bc_, although _ab_ is in reality longer than _bc_.\r\nIn an experiment consisting of dividing a line into two equal parts,\r\nthe right eye tends to increase the half on the right, and the left eye\r\nto enlarge that on the left. To arrive at an exact estimate, we turn\r\nover the paper and find the exact centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.]\r\n\r\nIllusions of this kind become more striking when the distances to be\r\ncompared run in different directions. If we look at A and B (fig. 116),\r\nwhich are perfect squares, A appears greater in length than width,\r\nwhilst B, on the contrary, appears to have greater width than length.\r\nThe case is the same with angles. On looking at fig. 117, angles 1,\r\n2, 3, 4 are straight, and should appear so when examined. But 1 and 2\r\nappear pointed, and 3 and 4 obtuse. The illusion is still greater if we\r\nlook at the figure with the right eye. If, on the contrary, we turn it,\r\nso that 2 and 3 are at the bottom, 1 and 2 will appear greatly pointed\r\nto the left eye. The divided angles always appear relatively greater\r\nthan they would appear without divisions.\r\n\r\nThe same illusion is presented in a number of examples in the course of\r\ndaily life. An empty room appears smaller than a furnished room, and a\r\nwall covered with paperhangings appears larger than a bare wall. It is\r\na well-known source of amusement to present someone in company with a\r\nhat, and request him to mark on the wall its supposed height from the\r\nground. The height generally indicated will be a size and a half too\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nWe will relate an experience described by Bravais: “When at sea,”\r\nhe says, “at a certain distance from a coast which presents many\r\ninequalities, if we attempt to draw the coastline as it presents\r\nitself to the eye, we shall find on verification that the horizontal\r\ndimensions have been correctly sketched at a certain scale, while all\r\nthe vertical angular objects have been represented on a scale twice as\r\nlarge. This illusion, which is sure to occur in estimates of this kind,\r\ncan be demonstrated by numerous observations.”\r\n\r\nM. Helmholtz has also indicated several optical illusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\nIf we examine fig. 118, the continuation of the line _a_ does not\r\nappear to be _d_,—which it is in reality,—but _f_, which is a little\r\nlower. This illusion is still more striking when we make the figure on\r\na smaller scale (fig. 119), as at B, where the two fine lines are in\r\ncontinuation with each other, but do not appear to be so, and at C,\r\nwhere they appear so, but are not in reality. If we draw the figures\r\nas at A (fig. 118), leaving out the line _d_, and look at them from\r\na gradually increasing distance, so that they appear to diminish, it\r\nwill be found that the further off the figure is placed, the more it\r\nseems necessary to lower the line _f_ to make it appear a continuation\r\nof _a_. These effects are produced by irradiation; they can also be\r\nproduced by black lines on a white foundation. Near the point of the\r\ntwo acute angles, the circles of diffusion of the two black lines touch\r\nand mutually reinforce each other; consequently the retinal image of\r\nthe narrow line presents its maximum of darkness nearest to the broad\r\nline, and appears to deviate on that side. In figures of this kind,\r\nhowever, executed on a larger scale, as in fig. 118, irradiation\r\ncan scarcely be the only cause of illusion. We will continue our\r\nexposition as a means of finding an explanation. In fig. 120, A and B\r\npresent some examples pointed out by Hering; the straight, parallel\r\nlines, _a b_, and _c d_, appear to bend outwards at A, and inwards\r\nat B. But the most striking example is that represented by fig. 121,\r\npublished by Zollner.\r\n\r\nThe vertical black strips of this figure are parallel with each other,\r\nbut they appear convergent and divergent, and seem constantly turned\r\nout of a vertical position into a direction inverse to that of the\r\noblique lines which divide them. The separate halves of the oblique\r\nlines are displaced respectively, like the narrow lines in fig. 119.\r\nIf the figure is turned so that the broad vertical lines present\r\nan inclination of 45° to the horizon, the convergence appears even\r\nmore remarkable, whilst we notice less the apparent deviation of the\r\nhalves of the small lines, which are then horizontal and vertical. The\r\ndirection of the vertical and horizontal lines is less modified than\r\nthat of the oblique lines. We may look upon these latter illusions as\r\nfresh examples of the aforesaid rule, according to which acute angles\r\nclearly defined, but of small size, appear, as a rule, relatively\r\nlarger when we compare with obtuse or right angles which are undivided;\r\nbut if the apparent enlargement of an acute angle shows itself in such\r\na manner that the two sides appear to diverge, the illusions given in\r\nfigs. 118, 120, and 121, will be the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.—The horizontal lines, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_,\r\nare strictly parallel; their appearance of deviation is caused by the\r\noblique lines.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 118 the narrow lines appear to turn towards the point where\r\nthey penetrate the thick line and disappear, to appear afterwards in\r\ncontinuation of each other. In fig. 120 the two halves of each of the\r\ntwo straight lines seem to deviate through the entire length in such\r\na manner that the acute angles which they form with the oblique lines\r\nappear enlarged. The same effect is shown by the vertical lines of fig.\r\n121.\r\n\r\nM. Helmholtz is of opinion (figs. 120, 121) that the law of contrast\r\nis insufficient to entirely explain the phenomena, and believes that\r\nthe effect is also caused by the movements of the eye. In fact, the\r\nillusions almost entirely disappear, if we fix on a point of the object\r\nin order to develop an accidental image, and when we have obtained one\r\nvery distinctly, which is quite possible with Zollner’s design (fig.\r\n121), this image will present not the slightest trace of illusion. In\r\nfig. 118 the displacement of the gaze will exercise no very decided\r\ninfluence on the strengthening of the illusion; on the contrary, it\r\ndisappears when we turn our eyes on the narrow line, _ad_. On the other\r\nhand, the fixing of the eyes causes the illusion to disappear with\r\nrelative facility in fig. 120, and with more difficulty in fig. 121;\r\nit will, however, disappear equally in the latter design, if we fix it\r\nimmovably, and instead of considering it as composed of black lines on\r\na white background, we compel ourselves to picture it as white lines on\r\na black foundation; then the illusion vanishes. But if we let our eyes\r\nwander over the illustration, the illusion will return in full force.\r\nWe can indeed succeed in completely destroying the illusion produced by\r\nthese designs by covering them with a sheet of opaque paper, on which\r\nwe rest the point of a pin. Looking fixedly at the point, we suddenly\r\ndraw away the paper, and can then judge if the gaze has been fixed and\r\nsteady according to the clearness of the accidental image which is\r\nformed as a result of the experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.—The vertical strips are parallel; they appear\r\nconvergent or divergent under the influence of the oblique lines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.—Observation of electric spark.]\r\n\r\nThe light of an electric spark furnishes the surest and simplest means\r\nof counteracting the influence of movements of the eyes, as during the\r\nmomentary duration of the spark the eye cannot execute any sensible\r\nmovement. For this experiment the present writer has made use of a\r\nwooden box, A B C D (fig. 122), blackened on the inside. Two\r\nholes are made for the eyes on each side of the box, _f_ and _g_. The\r\nobserver looks through the openings, _f_, and in front of openings,\r\n_g_, the objects are placed; these are pierced through with a pin,\r\nwhich can be fixed by the eyes in the absence of the electric spark,\r\nwhen the box is perfectly dark. The box is open, and rests on the\r\ntable, B D, to allow of changing the object. The conducting\r\nwires of electricity are at _h_ and _i_; in the centre of the box is a\r\nstrip of cardboard, white on the side facing the spark, the light of\r\nwhich it shelters from the eye of the observer and throws back again\r\non the object. With the electric light the illusion was completely\r\nperceptible with fig. 118, while it disappeared altogether in fig. 120;\r\nwith fig. 121 it was not entirely absent, but when it showed itself,\r\nit was much more feeble and doubtful than usual, though the intensity\r\nof light was quite sufficient to allow of the form of the object being\r\nvery distinctly examined. Thus two different phenomena have to be\r\nexplained; first, the feeble illusion which is produced without the\r\nintervention of movements of the eye; and secondly, the strengthening\r\nof the illusion in consequence of these movements. The law of contrast\r\nsufficiently explains the first; that which one perceives most\r\ndistinctly with indirect vision is the concordance of directions with\r\ndimensions of the same kind. We perceive more distinctly the difference\r\nof direction presented at their intersection by the two sides of an\r\nacute or obtuse angle, than the deviation that exists between one of\r\nthe sides and the perpendicular which we imagine placed on the other\r\nside, but which is not marked. By being distributed on both sides,\r\nthe apparent enlargement of the angles gives way to displacements,\r\nand changes of direction of the sides. It is difficult to correct\r\nthe apparent displacement of the lines when they remain parallel to\r\ntheir true direction; for this reason, the illusion of the figure is\r\nrelatively more inflexible. Changes of direction, on the contrary,\r\nare recognised more easily if we examine the figure attentively, when\r\nthese changes have the effect of causing the concordance of the lines\r\n(which accord in reality) to disappear; it is probably because of the\r\ndifference in aspect of the numerous oblique lines of figs. 120 and\r\n121 that the concordance of these lines escapes the observer’s notice.\r\nAs regards the influence exercised by the motion of the eyes in the\r\napparent direction of the lines, M. Helmholtz, after discussing the\r\nmatter very thoroughly, proves the strengthening of the illusion in\r\nZollner’s illustration to be caused by those motions. It is not now our\r\nintention to follow out the whole of this demonstration; it will be\r\nsufficient to point out to the reader a fruitful force of study, with\r\nbut little known results.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were well acquainted with the influence of oblique lines. At\r\nPompeii, fresco paintings are to be found, in which the lines are not\r\nparallel, so that they satisfy the eye influenced by adjacent lines.\r\nEngravers in copper-plate have also studied the influence of _etchings_\r\non the parallelism of straight lines, and they calculate the effect\r\nthat they will produce on the engraving. In some ornamentations in\r\nwhich these results have not been calculated, it sometimes happens that\r\nparallel lines do not appear parallel because of the influence of other\r\noblique lines, and a disagreeable effect is produced. A similar result\r\nis to be seen at the railway station at Lyons, the roof of which is\r\ncovered with inlaid work in _point de Hongrie_. The wide parallel lines\r\nof this ceiling appear to deviate, a result produced by a series of\r\noblique lines formed by the planks of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.—Two sides of a Thaumatrope disc.]\r\n\r\nHaving given a long account of the result of M. Helmholtz’s labours,\r\nwe will pass to the consideration of another kind of experiments,\r\nor rather appliances, based on the illusions of vision, and the\r\npersistence of impressions on the retina.\r\n\r\nThe Thaumatrope, to which we have already referred, is a plaything\r\nof very ancient origin, based on the principle we have mentioned. It\r\nconsists of a cardboard disc, which we put in motion by pulling two\r\ncords. On one side of the disc a cage, _a_, is portrayed, on the other\r\na bird, _b_ (fig. 123). When the little contrivance is turned round,\r\nthe two designs are seen at the same time, and form but one image—that\r\nof a bird in its cage (fig. 124). It is of course hardly necessary to\r\nadd that the designs may be varied.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to M. Plateau’s rotating disc (the\r\nPhenakistoscope). Through the narrow slits we perceive in succession\r\nrepresentations of different positions of a certain action. The\r\npersistence of the luminous impressions on the retina gives to the eye\r\nthe sensation of a continuous image, which seems animated by the same\r\nmovements as those portrayed in the different phases (fig. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.—Appearance of the Thaumatrope in rotation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.—Plateau’s Phenokistoscope.]\r\n\r\nThe Zootrope (fig. 126) is a perfected specimen of this apparatus. It\r\nis composed of a cylinder of cardboard, turning on a central axis.\r\nThe cylinder is pierced with vertical slits at regular intervals, and\r\nthrough which the spectator can see the designs upon a band of paper\r\nadapted to the interior of the apparatus in rotation. The designs are\r\nso executed that they represent the different times of a movement\r\nbetween two extremes; and in consequence of the impressions upon the\r\nretina the successive phases are mingled, so the spectator believes he\r\nsees, without transition, the entire movement. We give a few specimens\r\nof the pictures for the Zootrope (fig. 127). We have here an ape\r\nleaping over a hedge, a dancing “Punch,” a gendarme pursuing a thief,\r\na person holding the devil by the tail, a robber coming out of a box,\r\nand a sportsman firing at a bird. The extremes of the movement are\r\nright and left; the intermediary figures make the transitions, and they\r\nare usually equal in number to the slits in the Zootrope. It is not\r\ndifficult to construct such an instrument, and better drawings could be\r\nmade than the specimens taken at random from a model. The earth might\r\nbe represented turning in space, or a fire-engine pumping water could\r\nbe given, and thus the Zootrope might be quite a vehicle of instruction\r\nas well as of amusement. This instrument is certainly one of the most\r\ncurious in the range of optics, and never fails to excite interest. The\r\ningenious contrivances which have up to the present time reproduced it,\r\nall consist in the employment of narrow slits, which besides reducing\r\nthe light to a great extent, and consequently the light and clearness\r\nof the object, require the instrument to be set in rapid rotation,\r\nwhich greatly exaggerates the rapidity of the movements represented,\r\nand without which the intermissions of the spectacle could not unite in\r\na continuous sensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.—The Zootrope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.—Pictures used in the Zootrope.]\r\n\r\nWe present here an apparatus based on a very different optical\r\narrangement. In the _Praxinoscope_[12] (a name given by the inventor,\r\nMr. Reynaud, to this new apparatus), the substitution of one object for\r\nanother is accomplished without interruption in the vision, or solution\r\nof continuity, and consequently without a sensible reduction of light;\r\nin a word, the eye beholds _continuously_ an image which, nevertheless,\r\nis incessantly changing before it. The result was obtained in this\r\nmanner. Having sought unsuccessfully by mechanical means to substitute\r\none object for another without interrupting the continuity of the\r\nspectacle, the inventor was seized with the idea of producing this\r\nsubstitution, not with the objects themselves, but with their virtual\r\nimages. He then contrived the arrangement which we will now describe.\r\nA plane mirror, AB (fig. 129), is placed at a certain distance from\r\nan object, CD, and the virtual image will be seen at C′D′. If we then\r\nturn the plane mirror and object towards the point, O, letting BE and\r\nDF be their new positions, the image will be at C″D″. _Its axis_, O,\r\n_will not be displaced_. In the positions, AB and CD, first occupied\r\nby the plane mirror and the object, we now place another mirror and\r\nobject. Let us imagine the eye placed at M. Half of the first object\r\nwill be seen at OD″, and half of the second at OC′. If we continue\r\nthe rotation of the instrument, we shall soon have mirror No. 2 at\r\nTT′, and object No. 2 at SS′. At the same moment the image of object\r\nNo. 2 will be seen entirely at C‴D″. Mirror No. 2 and its object will\r\nsoon after be at BE and DF. If we then imagine another mirror and its\r\ncorresponding object at AB and CD, the same succession of phenomena\r\nwill be reproduced. This experiment therefore shows that a series of\r\nobjects placed on the perimeter of a polygon will be seen successively\r\nat the centre, if the plane mirrors are placed on a concentric polygon,\r\nthe “apothème” of which will be less by one-half, and which will be\r\ncarried on by the same movement. In its practical form, M. Reynaud’s\r\napparatus consists of a polygonal or simply circular box (fig. 128),\r\n(for the polygon may be replaced by a circle without the principle or\r\nresult being changed), in the centre of which is placed a prism of\r\nexactly half a diameter less, the surface of which is covered with\r\nplane mirrors. A strip of cardboard bearing a number of designs of\r\nthe same object, portrayed in different phases of action, is placed\r\nin the interior of the circular rim of the box, so that each position\r\ncorresponds to a plate of the glass prism. A moderate movement of\r\nrotation given to the apparatus, which is raised on a central pivot,\r\nsuffices to produce the substitution of the figures, and the animated\r\nobject is reflected on the centre of the glass prism with remarkable\r\nbrightness, clearness, and delicacy of movement. Constructed in this\r\nmanner, the _Praxinoscope_ forms an optical toy both interesting and\r\namusing. In the evening, a lamp placed on a support _ad hoc_, in the\r\ncentre of the apparatus, suffices to light it up very clearly, and a\r\nnumber of persons may conveniently assemble round it, and witness the\r\neffects produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.—M. Reynaud’s Praxinoscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.]\r\n\r\nBesides the attractions offered by the animated scenes of the\r\n_Praxinoscope_, the apparatus may also be made the object of useful\r\napplications in the study of optics. It permits an object, a drawing,\r\nor a colour, to be substituted instantaneously in experiments on\r\nsecondary or subjective images, etc., on the contrast of colours or\r\nthe persistence of impressions, etc. We can also make what is called\r\na _synthesis of movements_ by placing before the prism a series of\r\ndiagrams of natural objects by means of photography.\r\n\r\nM. Reynaud has already arranged an apparatus which exhibits in the\r\nlargest dimensions the animated reflection of the _Praxinoscope_, and\r\nwhich lends itself to the demonstration of curious effects before\r\na numerous auditory. The ingenious inventor has recently contrived\r\nalso a very curious improvement in the original apparatus. In the\r\n_Praxinoscope Theatre_ he has succeeded in producing truly ornamental\r\n_tableaux_, as on a small Lilliputian stage, in the centre of which the\r\nprincipal object moves with startling effect. To obtain this result, M.\r\nReynaud commences by cutting out in black paper the different figures,\r\nthe whole of which will form an object animated by the rotation\r\ngiven to the _Praxinoscope_. To supply the decorations, he arranges\r\non the black foundation the image of an appropriate coloured design\r\nby means of a piece of glass. It is well known that transparent glass\r\npossesses the property of giving a reflection of the objects on the\r\nnearest side as well as on the farthest. We may recall the applications\r\nof this optical effect in theatres, and also in courses of physics,\r\nunder the title of _impalpable spectres_. It is also by reflection\r\non thin, transparent glass, that M. Reynaud produces the image of\r\nthe ornamentations in the _Praxinoscope Theatre_. The decorations\r\nare really placed in the lid, which is held by a hook in a vertical\r\nposition, thus forming the front side of the apparatus (fig. 130). In\r\nthis side a rectangular opening is made, through which the spectator\r\n(using both eyes) perceives at the same time the animated reflection\r\nof the _Praxinoscope_, and the immovable image of the decorations\r\nreflected in the transparent glass. The position of the latter and\r\nits distance from the coloured decorations are arranged so that the\r\nreflection is thrown behind the moving figure, which consequently\r\nappears in strong relief against the background, the effect produced\r\nbeing very striking. It is evident that to change the decorations it\r\nis only necessary to place in succession on a slide the different\r\n_chromos_ representing landscapes, buildings, the interior of a\r\ncircus, etc. It is easy to choose an arrangement suitable for each of\r\nthe moving figures placed in the _Praxinoscope_. By this clever and\r\nentirely novel optical combination, the mechanism of the contrivance\r\nis entirely lost sight of, leaving only the effect produced by the\r\nanimated figures, which fulfil their different movements on the little\r\nstage. The _Praxinoscope Theatre_ can also be used as well in the\r\nevening as in the daytime. By daylight, it is sufficient to place it\r\nbefore a window, and in the evening the same effects may be produced,\r\nperhaps in even a more striking manner, by simply placing a lamp on the\r\nstand, with a small plated reflector, and a lamp-shade. The illusion\r\nproduced by this scientific plaything is very complete and curious,\r\nand M. Reynaud cannot be too much commended for so cleverly applying\r\nhis knowledge of physics in the construction of an apparatus which is\r\nat the same time both an optical instrument and a charming source of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 130.—The Praxinoscope Theatre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.—The Dazzling Top.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the toys founded upon the persistency of impressions upon the\r\nretina we may instance the “Dazzling Top” (fig. 131). This remarkable\r\ninvention is quite worthy of a place in every cabinet, and is an\r\ningenious specimen of a perfected Helmholtz top. It is a metallic toy\r\nput in motion by means of a cord wound round a groove. The axis is\r\nhollow, admits a metallic stem, and fits into a handle which is held in\r\nthe hand. The top is placed upon a little cup in an upright position,\r\nand it is then set spinning in the usual way with the cord. The stem\r\nand handle are then withdrawn, and as the top will continue to spin for\r\na long time, discs and various outline shapes can be fixed upon it, and\r\nvarious objects will be shadowed thereon. Cups, bowls, candlesticks,\r\nand jugs can be seen plainly revolving as the top carries the wire\r\nrepresentation in outline rapidly past the eyes. Coloured cardboard can\r\nbe worked into various patterns, and much amusement will be created\r\namongst children and young people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] From _praxis_, action, and _skopein_, to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n OPTICAL ILLUSIONS CONTINUED—EXPERIMENTS—THE TALKING HEAD—GHOST\r\n ILLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of optical illusions is so considerable that we have\r\nno intention of describing them all, and will merely cite a few other\r\nexamples. The following facts have been communicated to us by M.\r\nNachet:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.—Hexagonal appearance formed by circles joined\r\ntogether.]\r\n\r\nWhen examining algæ under the microscope, we notice the spaces which\r\nseparate the streaks ornamenting the silicious covering of these\r\nvarious organisms, and it is explained that they are formed by hexagons\r\nvisible only when we examine the object with a powerful microscope.\r\n“For a long time,” says M. Nachet, “I occupied myself with the\r\nexamination of the hexagonal appearance of the points constituting\r\nthe streaks. Why should these hexagons show themselves, and how could\r\nthey be other than the visible base of small pyramids piled very\r\nclosely one on the other; and if this were the case, why were not the\r\npoints of the little pyramids visible? Or, was the structure before me\r\nanalogous to that of the eyes of insects? Then the carapace would be\r\nbut a surface of perforated polygonal openings. This latter hypothesis\r\nwas attractive enough, and would have explained many things; but some\r\ncareful observations with very powerful object-glasses, quite free\r\nfrom blemishes, had shown me that these hexagons had round points,\r\ncontrary to the descriptions of micrographs. These observations,\r\ncorroborated by the micrographic photographs of Lackerbauer, the\r\nmuch-regretted designer, and by Colonels Woodward and Washington, left\r\nnot the slightest doubt that it was necessary to discover why the\r\neye persistently saw hexagons where there were circles. To elucidate\r\nthis point, it was necessary to find some means of reproducing\r\nartificially what nature had accomplished with so much precision on\r\nthe surfaces of algæ. After many fruitless attempts, I decided on\r\nmaking a trial of a stereotype plate covered with dots arranged in\r\nquincunxes, very close together” (figs. 132 and 133). “The result was\r\nmore successful than I had hoped; the effect produced is exactly that\r\nof the arrangement of the so-called hexagons of the most beautiful\r\nof the algæ, the _Pleurosigma angulata_. If these stereotypes are\r\nexamined with one eye only, we shall be immediately convinced that we\r\nhave to do with hexagonal polygons.” It is useless to give any long\r\nexposition of a figure so clearly explanatory; it is simply an effect\r\nof the contrast and opposition of the black and white in the sensation\r\nof the retina. This effect is particularly striking with fig. 134, a\r\nnegative photograph heliographically engraved according to fig. 133.\r\nIn this the white points seem to destroy the black spaces, and to\r\napproach each other tangentially, and the irradiation is so intense\r\nthat the white circles appear much larger than the black of fig. 133,\r\nalthough of the same diameter. There are in these facts many points\r\nwhich may interest not only students of micrography, but also artists.\r\nAs to the algæ, the origin of this investigation, it remains to be\r\ndiscovered if these circles which cover their silicious carapace are\r\nthe projection of small hemispheres, or the section of openings made in\r\nthe thick covering. Certain experiments, however, seem to prove that\r\nthey are hemispheres, and the theory is also confirmed by a microscopic\r\nphotograph from Lackerbauer’s collection, magnified 3,000 diameters,\r\nin which a black central point is seen in the centre of each circle, a\r\ncertain reflection of the luminous source reproduced in the focus of\r\neach of the small demi-spheres which constitute the ornament of the\r\nalgæ. The microscope, which has progressively shown first the streaks,\r\nthen the hexagons, and then the round points, will surely clear up the\r\npoint some day or other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.—Another figure of the same kind.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.—Third figure.]\r\n\r\nMr. Silvanus P. Thompson, Professor of Physics at University College,\r\nBristol, has recently presented the French Society of Physical Science\r\nwith a curious example of optical illusion, the true cause of which is\r\nnot clearly known, but which we may compare with other facts made known\r\nsome time ago, of which no precise explanation has been given. Let us\r\nfirst consider in what the effect discovered by Mr. S. P. Thompson\r\nconsists, according to the description that has been given of it by\r\nM. C. M. Gariel; the illustrations here given will also allow of our\r\nverifying the truth of the statements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.        Fig. 136.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson’s optical illusion. Give a circular movement to these\r\nfigures, and the circles will appear to turn round.]\r\n\r\nThe first illustration consists of a series of concentric circles of\r\nabout the width of a millimetre, separated by white intervals of the\r\nsame size (fig. 135). These dimensions are not absolute; they vary with\r\nthe distance, and may even be a few inches in width if it is desired\r\nto show the phenomenon to a rather numerous auditory. If we hold the\r\ndesign in the hand, and give it a twirl by a little movement of the\r\nwrist, the circle appears to turn round its centre, and the rotation\r\nis in the same direction, and is equally swift; that is to say, the\r\ncircle appears to accomplish a complete turn, whilst the cardboard\r\nreally accomplishes one in the same direction. For the second effect\r\nwe draw a dark circle, in the interior of which are placed a number\r\nof indentations at regular intervals (fig. 136). Operating in the\r\nsame manner as described above, this notched wheel appears to turn\r\nround its centre, but this time in a different direction from the real\r\nmovement. In this, however, as in the other design, the effect is more\r\nsatisfactory if we do not look directly at it; the movements also are\r\nparticularly striking in combinations such as that represented in\r\nfig. 137, in which the multiplicity of circles does not allow us to\r\nfix one specially. We may add that the same effects may be obtained\r\nwith eccentric wheels, or even with other curves than circles. By\r\nmeans of a photograph on glass, Mr. Thompson has been able to reflect\r\nthese designs on a screen where they were obtained on a large scale; a\r\ncircular movement was communicated to the photographic plate, so that\r\nthe design moved in a circular manner on the screen, and in this case\r\nalso there existed the illusion that every circle seemed turning round\r\nits centre. And what is the explanation of these curious effects? Mr.\r\nThompson does not believe (and we share his opinion) that the faculty\r\npossessed by the retina of preserving images during a certain time\r\n(_persistence of impressions on the retina_) can entirely explain these\r\nphenomena. Without desiring to formulate a decided theory, Mr. Thompson\r\nis of opinion that we may class these facts with others which have been\r\nknown for some time, and that perhaps it is necessary to attribute to\r\nthe eye some new faculty which may explain the whole at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.—Another figure of Mr. Thompson’s. The\r\ndifferent circles appear to turn round if we give the design a rotating\r\nmovement.]\r\n\r\nBrewster and Adams have described phenomena which are equally curious,\r\nthe principal of which we will describe, adding also some analogous\r\ninvestigations due to Mr. Thompson. The result seems to be that there\r\nexists in the eye a badly-defined purpose of nature, which in a certain\r\nway _compensates_ (Brewster) for the real phenomenon, because it has a\r\ncontrary effect, which will continue for some time after the cessation\r\nof the phenomena, and which gives by itself a sensation contrary to\r\nthat which the real movement would have produced. Thus, after having\r\nfixed our eyes for two or three minutes on a rushing waterfall, if we\r\nsuddenly turn our glance on the adjacent rocks, the latter appear to\r\nmove from top to bottom. It is not a question here of the effect of\r\nthe relative movement to be observed on regarding _simultaneously_ the\r\nfalling water and the rocks; if one can succeed in abstracting oneself\r\nto such an extent that the water appears motionless, the rocks appear\r\nto take a contrary movement. In the phenomenon we describe there is no\r\nsimultaneous comparison; the eyes are turned _successively_ first on\r\nthe water, and then on the rocks. In a rapid river, such as the Rhine\r\nabove the fall at Schaffhausen, the stream is not equally swift in\r\nevery part, and the current is noticeably more rapid in the middle of\r\nthe river than near the banks. If we look fixedly at the centre of the\r\nstream, and then suddenly turn our eyes towards the banks, it will\r\nappear as though the river were flowing back towards its source. This\r\nkind of _compensation_ does not only produce an apparent displacement,\r\nbut also changes in size. When travelling at great speed in a railway\r\ntrain, the objects of the surrounding country as one flies by them\r\ngradually appear smaller and smaller. If, when this occurs, we suddenly\r\nremove our eyes to the interior of the railway carriage, and fix them\r\non immovable objects, such as the sides of the compartment, or the\r\nfaces of our travelling companions, the images on the retina will\r\nreally preserve the same size, and yet the objects will appear larger.\r\nSuch are some of the interesting facts among those discovered by Mr.\r\nThompson; and though we do not intend to push the inquiry further,\r\nwe think it may not be without interest to describe here another\r\nillusion of that organ whose properties are in every way so curious and\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.—Experiment on complementary colours.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.—Design for experiment or the _punctum cæcum_.]\r\n\r\nAnother experiment to show the existence of impressions received by the\r\nretina can be made with the figure above (138). If the gaze be fixed\r\nupon the dark spot in the centre of the white figure for about half a\r\nminute, and the eyes then directed to the ceiling, or a sheet of white\r\npaper, the white figure will be reproduced _in black_. This result is\r\nbased upon the principle of complementary colours. A red design, for\r\ninstance, will be reproduced in green.\r\n\r\nThere is a dark spot in every human eye—that is, a spot which is\r\ninsensible to light. The eye is generally regarded as a perfect\r\ninstrument, but it is not yet so by any means. One of our great\r\nphilosophers remarked that if an instrument were sent home to him so\r\nfull of errors he would feel justified in returning it to the optician.\r\nBut the eye has its dark place, the _punctum cæcum_, and it can be\r\ndiscovered by covering the left eye with the hand, and holding the\r\npresent page at arm’s length with the other. Then fix the gaze on the\r\nsmall cross in the picture, and bring the book close up. At a little\r\ndistance the white ball will disappear from the page (fig. 139).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 140.—An optical illusion.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration (fig. 140) shows us a very curious optical illusion,\r\nand one very easy to practise. Roll up a sheet of paper, and look\r\nthrough it, as through a telescope, with the right eye, _keeping both\r\neyes open_. Then place the left hand open palm towards you against the\r\nroll of paper, you will then appear to be looking through a hole in\r\nyour left hand. Sometimes the effect is produced without holding up the\r\nother hand to the roll, as shown in fig. 140.\r\n\r\nAmong optical illusions there are a great number that may be produced\r\nby means of mirrors. The divided telescope is an example. The\r\napparatus, raised on a firm stand, allows of one apparently seeing an\r\nobject through a stone or other opaque object, as shown in fig. 141.\r\nThe illustration shows the arrangement of the apparatus. The observer,\r\nlooking through it, plainly perceives the object through the glass;\r\nthe image is reflected four times before reaching his eye, by means of\r\nsmall mirrors concealed in the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.—A divided telescope.]\r\n\r\nConvex or concave mirrors distort images in a singular manner, and\r\nproduce very interesting effects. _Anamorphoses_ constitute particular\r\nobjects belonging specially to the class of experiments relating to\r\ncylindrical mirrors. They are images made according to determined\r\nrules, but so distorted that when regarding them fixedly we can only\r\ndistinguish confused strokes. When they are seen reflected in the\r\ncurved mirrors, they present, on the contrary, a perfectly regular\r\nappearance. Fig. 142 exhibits an Anamorphosis made by a cylindrical\r\nmirror. It will be seen that the confused image of the horizontal paper\r\nis reflected in the cylindrical mirror, producing the figure of a\r\njuggler. It is easy to contrive similar designs one’s-self; and comical\r\nmirrors may also be employed which produce particular effects of a no\r\nless interesting kind. The next illustration is of a set of figures\r\nwhich in a cylindrical mirror look like the ten of hearts (fig. 143).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.—Cylindrical Mirror and Anamorphosis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.—Anamorphus design for the ten of hearts.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable applications of mirrors in amusing\r\nexperiments is undoubtedly that of the severed and _talking head_. A\r\nfew years back this trick obtained considerable success in Paris and a\r\nnumber of other towns. The spectators beheld a small space set apart,\r\nin which was placed a table on three legs; on this table was a human\r\nhead, placed in cloth on a dish. The head moved its eyes and spoke;\r\nit evidently belonged to a man whose body was completely hidden. The\r\nspectators thought they saw an empty space beneath the table, but the\r\nbody of the individual who was really seated there was concealed by\r\ntwo glasses placed at an inclination of 45° to the walls on the right\r\nand left. The whole was arranged in such a manner that the reflection\r\nof the walls coincided with the visible part of the wall at the back\r\nof the room. The three walls were painted in one colour, and a subdued\r\nlight increased the illusion, the effect of which was remarkable (fig.\r\n144).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.—The talking head.]\r\n\r\nThe spectres designed by Robin also attracted considerable public\r\nattention within recent times. They were images formed by the medium\r\nof transparent glass. Glass panes often produce the phenomenon of\r\nspectres. In the evening, when it is dark out of doors, it is easy\r\nto prove that the reflection of objects in a lighted room can be\r\nreproduced behind the window panes by reason of the darkness outside.\r\nIf we approach the window pane, we see also the real objects outside,\r\na balcony, tree, etc. These real objects mingle with the reflected\r\nimage, and combine to produce very curious effects. In this way M.\r\nRobin has contrived the effects of the theatre. He throws on the stage\r\nthe reflection of a person dressed as a Zouave, and he himself, armed\r\nwith a sabre, stabs the spectre through the body. A great number of\r\nother singular effects have been obtained in the same manner. Pepper’s\r\nGhost was managed in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.—The ghost effect.]\r\n\r\nWithin recent times, images produced in a similar way have been\r\nutilized to facilitate the study of drawing. A piece of glass is fixed\r\nvertically on a black board (fig. 146). A model to copy from is placed\r\non one side of the piece of glass, and is arranged so that the visual\r\nray passes obliquely through the glass, and we perceive the reflection\r\nof the design very clearly on the other side. It is then very easily\r\nreproduced with a pencil on a sheet of white paper by tracing the\r\noutlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.—Drawing by reflection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n VISION—THE EYE—THE STEREOSCOPE—SPECTRUM ANALYSIS—THE\r\n SPECTROSCOPE—THE TELESCOPE AND MICROSCOPE—PHOTOGRAPHY—DISSOLVING\r\n VIEWS—LUMINOUS PAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye and vision are such important subjects to all of us that\r\nwe may be excused for saying something more concerning phenomena\r\nconnected with them, and the instruments we use for assisting them.\r\nWe do not propose to write a treatise upon the physiology of vision,\r\nfor we know the image in the eye is produced physically in the same\r\nmanner as the image in a camera obscura. In the eye the sides of the\r\nbox are represented by the sclerotic (see chap. x. fig. 95); the dark\r\ninner surface has its parallel in the pigment of the choroid; the\r\nopening in the box in the pupil of the eye; the convex lens in the\r\ncrystalline and the cornea; and the retina receives the image. But why\r\nwe see—beyond the fact that we do see—no one can explain. Science is\r\ndumb on the subject. Thought and consciousness elude our grasp; and, as\r\nProfessor Tyndall says on this subject, “we stand face to face with the\r\nincomprehensible.”\r\n\r\nBut there are many interesting facts connected with our vision which\r\nmay be plainly described. Some people are obliged to carry an object\r\n(or a book) to within ten inches of the eye to see it distinctly; and\r\na person who does not possess convergent power of the eye will have\r\nto move it farther off, or use convex glasses; while a “near-sighted”\r\nperson, whose eyes are too quickly convergent, will use concave glasses\r\nto bring the object near to the eye.\r\n\r\nThere is but one small place in the retina of the eye which admits\r\nof perfect vision. This, the most sensitive portion, is called the\r\n“yellow spot,” and vision becomes more and more indistinct from this\r\npoint towards the circumference. This can be proved by any one; for\r\nin reading we are obliged to carry our eyes from word to word, and\r\nbackwards and forwards along the lines of print. Another very important\r\nelement in our vision is the contraction and enlargement of the iris\r\naround the pupil. In cases where strong light would only dazzle us\r\nthe iris expands, and the pupil is contracted to a sufficient size to\r\naccommodate our vision. At night, or in a darkened room, the pupil is\r\nenlarged. This change will account for our not being immediately able\r\nto see objects when we have passed from darkness to great light, or\r\n_vice versâ_. The iris must have time to accommodate itself to the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNow, outside the small space of perfect vision above mentioned, there\r\nis a circle of considerable extent, called the “field of vision.” In\r\nman this field, when the eyes are fixed, subtends an angle of about\r\n180°, because beyond that the rays cannot enter the pupil of the eye.\r\nBut in the lower animals, the fish and birds,—notably the ostrich,—the\r\nfield of vision is much more extensive, because the pupils are more\r\nprominent, or the eyes are set more towards the sides of the head. The\r\nostrich can see behind him, and fish can see in any direction without\r\napparent limit. Man can only see indistinctly; and though he can move\r\nhis eyes rapidly, he can see distinctly but a small portion of any\r\nobject at a time, yet he sees with both eyes simultaneously a single\r\nobject, because the two lines of vision unite at a single point, and as\r\nthe two images cover each other we perceive only one image. Beyond or\r\nwithin this point of meeting the vision is indistinct, but the angle of\r\nconvergence is always varied according to the distance of the object.\r\nIf we hold up a penholder in front of us, and in a line with any other\r\ndefined object,—say an ink-bottle,—we can see the penholder distinctly,\r\nand the ink-bottle indistinctly, as _two_ images. If we then look at\r\nthe ink-bottle we shall see it single, while the penholder will appear\r\ndouble, but with imperfect outlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.—The Stereoscope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.—Mode of taking photograph for Stereoscope.]\r\n\r\nAgain, if we look at a box both eyes will see it equally well, but the\r\nright eye will see a little more on its right side, and the left eye on\r\nthe left. It is on this principle that the Stereoscope is constructed.\r\nSir Charles Wheatstone was the inventor, and the instrument may be\r\nthus described:—Two pictures are taken by photography—one as the\r\nlandscape is seen by the right eye, the other as it is viewed by the\r\nleft; the points of view thus differing slightly. When both eyes are\r\nsimultaneously applied to the instrument the view is seen exactly as\r\nit would appear to the beholder at the actual place it represents. The\r\nviews are taken singly; one side at one time, and another after, as in\r\nthe camera (fig. 148). A is the first view; B is kept dark; C is the\r\nshutter for A. There are _Reflecting_ and _Refracting_ Stereoscopes.\r\nIn the former a mirror reflects the image into each eye; in the latter\r\nthe views are pasted on a card, side by side, and looked at through\r\nprismatic lenses. The principles of _Binocular Vision_ have been\r\napplied to the Microscope.\r\n\r\nIn foregoing chapters we have given many examples with diagrams of the\r\ntemporary impressions made upon the retina of the eye. It is a fact\r\nthat a wheel revolving at a great rate will appear to be standing still\r\nwhen suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning, because the eye has\r\nnot time to take in the motion in the instant of time, for the spokes\r\nof the wheel are not moving fast enough to convey the impression of\r\nmotion in that half second to the eye; yet the perfect outline of the\r\nwheel is distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nIndeed, distinct vision can be exercised in a very small fraction\r\nof a second. It was calculated by Professor Rood, and proved by\r\nexperiment, that _forty billionths_ of a second is sufficient time for\r\nthe eye to distinguish letters on a printed page. It this instance the\r\nilluminating power was an electric spark from a Leyden Jar.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked upon the distinctness with which we can see an object\r\nwhen we direct our gaze upon it, and this appears a self-evident\r\nproposition; but have any of our readers remarked the curious fact\r\nthat when they want to see a faint and particular star in the sky\r\nit will at once disappear when they gaze at it? The best way to see\r\nsuch very faint orbs as this is to _look away from them_,—a little to\r\none side or the other,—and then the tiny point will become visible\r\nagain to the eye. There is also a degree of phosphorescence in the\r\neye, which any one who receives a blow upon that organ will readily\r\nadmit. Even a simple pressure on the closed lid will show us a circle\r\nof light and “colours like a peacock’s tail,” as the great Newton\r\nexpressed it. There are many occasions in which light is perceived in\r\nthe eye—generally the result of muscular action; and the Irish term to\r\n“knock fire out of my eye” is founded upon philosophical facts.\r\n\r\nWe are many of us aware of “spots” on our eyes when our digestion is\r\nout of order, and the inability of the eye to see figures distinctly in\r\na faint light—within a proper seeing distance, too—has often given rise\r\nto the “ghost.” These shadowy forms are nothing more than affections of\r\nthe eye, and, as well remarked in Brewster’s Letters on Natural Magic,\r\n“are always _white_ because no other colour can be seen.” The light is\r\nnot sufficiently strong to enable the person to see distinctly; and as\r\nthe eye passes from side to side, and strives to take in the figure,\r\nit naturally seems shadowy and indistinct, and appears to move as our\r\neyes move. “When the eye dimly descries an inanimate object whose\r\ndifferent parts reflect different degrees of light, its brighter parts\r\nmay enable the spectator to keep up a continued view of it; but the\r\ndisappearance and reappearance of its fainter parts, and the change of\r\nshape which ensues, will necessarily give it the semblance of a living\r\nform; and if it occupies a position which is unapproachable, and where\r\nanimate objects cannot find their way, the mind will soon transfer to\r\nit a supernatural existence. In like manner a human figure shadowed\r\nforth in a feeble twilight may undergo similar changes, and after being\r\ndistinctly seen while it is in a situation favourable for receiving\r\nand reflecting light, it may suddenly disappear in a position before\r\nand within the reach of the observer’s eye; and if this evanescence\r\ntakes place in a path or roadway where there is no sideway by which the\r\nfigure could escape, it is not easy for an ordinary mind to efface the\r\nimpression which it cannot fail to receive.” This will account for many\r\nso-called “ghosts.”\r\n\r\nAccidental colours, or ocular spectra, are, so to speak, illusions,\r\nand differently-coloured objects will, when our gaze is turned from\r\nthem, give us different “spectra” or images. For instance, a violet\r\nobject will, when we turn to a sheet of white paper, give us a\r\nyellow “spectrum”; orange will be blue; black and white will change\r\nrespectively; red will become a blue-green. From a very strong white\r\nlight the accidental colours will vary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.—The Solar Spectrum.]\r\n\r\nThe Solar Spectrum is the name given to the coloured band formed by the\r\ndecomposition of a beam of light into its elementary colours, of which\r\nthere are seven. This is an easy experiment. A ray of light can be\r\nadmitted into a darkened room through a hole in the shutter, and thus\r\nadmitted will produce a white spot on the screen opposite, as at _g_ in\r\nthe diagram (fig. 149). If we interpose a prism—a triangular piece of\r\nglass—the “drop” of a chandelier will do—we cause it to diverge from\r\nits direct line, and it will produce a longer streak of light lower\r\ndown. This streak will exhibit the prismatic colours, or the “colours\r\nof the rainbow”; viz., red (at the top), orange, yellow, green, blue,\r\nindigo (blue), and violet last. These are the colours of the Solar\r\nSpectrum. The white light is thus decomposed, and it is called mixed\r\nlight, because of the seven rays of which it is composed. These rays\r\ncan be again collected and returned to the white light by means of a\r\nconvex lens.\r\n\r\n“White light,” said Sir Isaac Newton, “is composed of rays differently\r\nrefrangible,” and as we can obtain the colours of the rainbow from\r\nwhite light, we can, by painting them on a circular plate and turning\r\nit rapidly round, make the plate appear white. Thus we can prove that\r\nthe seven colours make “white” when intermingled. But Newton (1675) did\r\nnot arrive at the great importance of his experiment. He made a round\r\nhole in the shutter, and found that the various colours overlapped each\r\nother. But, in 1802, Dr. Wollaston improved on this experiment, and by\r\nadmitting the light through a tiny slit in the wood, procured an almost\r\nperfect spectrum of “simple” colours, each one perfectly distinct and\r\ndivided by black lines.\r\n\r\nBut twelve years later, Professor Fraunhofer made a chart of these\r\nlines, which are still known by his name. Only, instead of the 576\r\nhe discovered, there are now thousands known to us! To Fraunhofer’s\r\ntelescope Mr. Simms added a collimating lens, and so the Spectroscope\r\nwas begun; and now we use a number of prisms and almost perfect\r\ninstruments, dispersing the light through each. We have here an\r\nillustration of a simple Spectroscope, which is much used for chemical\r\nanalysis (fig. 150).\r\n\r\nIn the spectrum we have long and short waves of light, as we have\r\nlong and short (high and low) waves in music, called notes. The long\r\nor low notes are as the red rays, the high notes as the blue waves of\r\nlight. (Here we have another instance of the similarity between light\r\nand sound.) But suppose we shut out the daylight and substitute an\r\nartificial light. If we use a lamp burning alcohol with salt (chloride\r\nof sodium), the spectrum will only consist of two yellow bands, all the\r\nother colours being absent. With lithium we obtain only two, one orange\r\nand one red. From this we deduce the fact that different substances\r\nwhen burning produce different spectra; and although a solid may (and\r\nplatinum will) give all seven colours in its spectrum, others, as we\r\nhave seen, will only give us a few, the portion of the spectrum between\r\nthe colours being black. Others are continuous, and transversed by\r\n“lines” or narrow spaces devoid of light; such is the spectrum of the\r\nsun, and by careful and attentive calculation and observation we can\r\nget an approximate idea of the matter surrounding the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.—The Spectroscope.]\r\n\r\nWe have said there are lines crossing the spectrum transversely; these\r\nare called Fraunhofer’s lines, after the philosopher who studied\r\nthem; they were, however, discovered by Wollaston. These lines are\r\ncaused by light from the lower portion of the sun passing through the\r\nmetallic vapours surrounding the orb in a state of incandescence, such\r\nas sodium, iron, etc. One of Fraunhofer’s lines, a black double line\r\nknown as D in the yellow portion of the spectrum, was known\r\nto occupy the same place as a certain _luminous_ line produced by\r\nsodium compounds in the flame of a spirit lamp. This gave rise to much\r\nconsideration, and at length Kirchkoff proved that the sodium vapour\r\nwhich gives out yellow light can also absorb that light; and this fact,\r\nviz., that every substance, which at a _certain temperature_ emits\r\nlight of a certain refrangibility, possesses at that temperature the\r\npower to absorb that same light. So the black lines are now considered\r\nthe reversal of luminous lines due to the incandescent vapours by which\r\nthe sun is surrounded. Thus the presence of an element can be found\r\nfrom black or luminous lines, so the existence of terrestrial elements\r\nin celestial bodies has been discovered by means of preparing charts\r\nof the lines of the terrestrial elements, and comparing them with the\r\nlines of stella _spectra_.\r\n\r\nWe have supposed the beam of light to enter through a slit in the\r\nshutter, and fall upon a screen or sheet. The solar spectrum shown by\r\nthe passage of the beam through a prism is roughly as below—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.—Example of the Spectrum.]\r\n\r\nFraunhofer substituted a telescope for the lens and the screen, and\r\ncalled his instrument a SPECTROSCOPE. He then observed the lines, which\r\nare always in the same position in the solar spectrum. The principal of\r\nthem he designated as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The first three are in\r\nthe red part of the spectrum; one in the yellow, then one in the green;\r\nF comes between green and blue, G in the indigo-blue, and H in the\r\nviolet. But these by no means exhaust the lines now visible. Year by\r\nyear the study of Spectrum Analysis has been perfected more and more,\r\nand now we are aware of more than three thousand “lines” existing in\r\nthe solar spectrum. The spectra of the moon and planets contain similar\r\ndark lines as are seen in the solar spectrum, but the fixed stars show\r\ndifferent lines. By spectrum analysis we know the various constituents\r\nof the sun’s atmosphere, and we can fix the result of our observations\r\nmade by means of the Spectroscope in the photographic camera. By\r\nthe more recent discoveries great studies have been made in “solar\r\nchemistry.”\r\n\r\nWhat can we do with the Spectroscope, or rather, What can we _not_ do?\r\nBy Spectroscopy we can find out, and have already far advanced upon\r\nour path of discovery, “the measure of the sun’s rotation, the speed\r\nand direction of the fierce tornados which sweep over its surface, and\r\ngive rise to the ‘maelstroms’ we term ‘sunspots,’ and the mighty alps\r\nof glowing gas that shoot far beyond the visible orb, ever changing\r\ntheir form and size; even the temperature and pressure of the several\r\nlayers and their fluctuations are in process of being defined and\r\ndetermined.” This is what science is doing for us, and when we have\r\nactually succeeded in ascertaining the weather at various depths in\r\nthe atmosphere of the sun, we shall be able to predict our own, which\r\ndepends so much upon the sun. Last year (1880) Professor Adams, in his\r\naddress to the British Association, showed that magnetic disturbances,\r\nidentical in kind, took place at places widely apart simultaneously.\r\nHe argues that the cause of these identical disturbances must be far\r\nremoved from the earth.\r\n\r\n“If,” he says, “we imagine the masses of iron, nickel, and magnesium\r\nin the sun to retain even in a slight degree their magnetic power in a\r\ngaseous state, we have a sufficient cause for all our magnetic changes.\r\nWe know that masses of metal are ever boiling up from the lower and\r\nhotter levels of the sun’s atmosphere to the cooler upper regions,\r\nwhere they must again form clouds to throw out their light and heat,\r\nand to absorb the light and heat coming from the hotter lower regions;\r\nthen they become condensed, and are drawn back again towards the\r\nbody of the sun, so forming those remarkable dark spaces or sunspots\r\nby their down rush to their former levels. In these vast changes we\r\nhave abundant cause for those magnetic changes which we observe at\r\nthe same instant at distant points on the surface of the earth.” So\r\nwe are indebted to the Spectroscope for many wonderful results—the\r\nconstitution of the stars, whether they are solid or gaseous, and many\r\nother wonders.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which we have arrived at these startling conclusions is\r\nnot difficult to be understood, but some little explanation will be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe existence of dark lines in the solar spectrum proves that certain\r\nrays of solar light are absent, or that there is less light. When we\r\nlook through the prism we perceive the spaces or lines, and we can\r\nproduce these ourselves by interposing some substance between the\r\nslit in the shutter before mentioned and the prism. The vapour of\r\nsodium will answer our purpose, and we shall find a dark line in the\r\nspectrum, the bright lines being absorbed by the vapour. We can subject\r\na substance to any temperature we please, and into any condition—solid,\r\nliquid, or gaseous; we can also send the light the substance may give\r\nout through certain media, and we can photograph the spectrum given out\r\nunder all conditions. _The distance of the source of the light makes\r\nno difference._ So whether it be the sun, or a far-distant star, we\r\ncan tell by the light sent to us what the physical condition of the\r\nstar may be. It was discovered in 1864 that the same metallic body\r\nmay give different _spectra_; for instance, the spectrum might be a\r\nband of light,—like the rainbow,—or a few isolated colours; or again,\r\ncertain detached lines in groups. The brightness of the spectrum lines\r\nwill change with the depth of the light-giving source, or matter which\r\nproduces it.\r\n\r\nWe have become aware by means of the Spectroscope that numerous metals\r\nknown to us on earth are in combustion in the sun, and new ones have\r\nthus been discovered. In the immense ocean of gas surrounding the\r\nsun there are twenty-two elements as given by Mr. Lockyer, including\r\niron, sodium, nickel, barium, zinc, lead, calcium, cobalt, hydrogen,\r\npotassium, cadmium, uranium, strontium, etc. Not only is the visible\r\nspectrum capable of minute examination, but, as in the case of the\r\n_heat spectrum_ already mentioned when speaking of Calorescence, the\r\nlight spectrum has been traced and photographed far beyond the dark\r\nspace after the blue and violet rays, seven times longer than the\r\nvisible solar spectrum—a spectrum of light invisible to our finite\r\nvision. Although a telescope has been invented for the examination of\r\nthese “ultra violet” rays, no human eye can see them. But—and here\r\nscience comes in—when a photographic plate is put in place of the\r\neye, the tiniest star can be seen and defined. Even the Spectroscope\r\nat length fails, because light at such limits has been held to be\r\n“too coarse-grained for our purposes”! “Light,” says a writer on this\r\nsubject “we can then no longer regard as made of smooth rays; we have\r\nto take into account—and to our annoyance—the fact that its ‘long\r\nlevelled rules’ are rippled, and its texture, as it were, loose woven”!\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago Professors Kirchkoff and Bunsen applied Fraunhofer’s\r\nmethod to the examination of coloured flames of various substances, and\r\nsince then we have been continually investigating the subject; yet much\r\nremains to be learnt of Spectrum Analysis, and Spectroscopy has still\r\nmuch to reveal. From Newton’s time to the present our scientists have\r\nbeen slowly but surely examining with the Spectroscope the composition\r\nof _spectra_, and the Spectroscope is now the greatest assistant we\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n“Spectrum Analysis, then, teaches us the great fact that solids and\r\nliquids give out continuous spectra, and vapours and gases give out\r\ndiscontinuous spectra instead of an unbroken light” (Lockyer). We\r\nhave found out that the sunlight and moonlight are identical, that\r\nthe moon gives us spectrum like a reflection of the former, but has\r\nno atmosphere, and that comets are but gases or vapours. The most\r\nminute particles of a grain of any substance can be detected to the\r\nmillionth fraction. The 1/1000 of a grain of blood can be very readily\r\ndistinguished in a stain after years have passed. The very year of a\r\ncertain vintage of wine has been told by means of “absorption,” or\r\nthe action of different bodies on light in the spectrum. It is now\r\neasy, “by means of the absorption of different vapours and different\r\nsubstances held in solution, to determine not only what the absorbers\r\nreally are, but also to detect a minute quantity.” The application of\r\nthis theory is due to Dr. Gladstone, who used hollow prisms filled\r\nwith certain substances, and so thickened the “absorption lines.” By\r\nthese lines, or bands, with the aid of the Spectrum Microscope, most\r\nwonderful discoveries have been made, and will continue to be made. We\r\nwill close this portion of the subject with a brief description of the\r\nSpectroscope in principle.\r\n\r\nThe instrument consists of two telescopes arranged with two\r\nobject-glasses on a stand (fig. 150). A narrow slit is put in place\r\nof the eye-piece of one, the arrangement admitting of the slit being\r\nmade smaller or larger by means of screws. The glass to which the slit\r\nis attached is called the collimating lens. The light, at the end of\r\nthe slit seen from the other telescope, being separated by the prisms\r\nbetween the two telescopes, will produce the spectrum. The Spectroscope\r\nis enclosed, so that no exterior light shall interfere with the spectra\r\nthe student wishes to observe. This merely indicates the principle, not\r\nthe details, of the Spectroscope, which vary in different instruments.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass from the Spectroscope to the Telescope and the\r\nMicroscope, instruments to which we are most largely indebted for our\r\nknowledge of our surroundings in earth, air, and water.\r\n\r\nThe word Telescope is derived from the Greek _tele_, far, and\r\n_skopein_, to see; and the instrument is based upon the property\r\npossessed by a convex lens or concave mirror, of converging to a focus\r\nthe rays of light falling on it from any object, and at that point\r\nor focus forming an image of the object. The following diagram will\r\nillustrate this. Let VW be a lens, and AB an object between the glass,\r\nand F the focus. The ray, A_c_, is so refracted as to appear to come\r\nfrom _a_. The ray from _b_ likewise appears in a similar way, and a\r\nmagnified image, _ab_, is the result (fig. 152).\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Telescope consists of an object-glass and an eye-lens,\r\nwith two intermediates to bring the object into an erect position. A\r\nlens brings it near to us, and a magnifier enlarges it for inspection.\r\nWe will now give a short history of the Telescope and its improved\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon was supposed to have had some knowledge of the Telescope,\r\nfor in 1551 it was written: “Great talke there is of a glass he made\r\nat Oxford, in which men see things that were don.” But a little later,\r\nBaptista Porta found out the power of the convex lens to bring objects\r\n“nearer.” It was, however, according to the old tale, quite by an\r\naccident that the Telescope was discovered about the year 1608.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.—Converging rays to a focus.]\r\n\r\nIn Middleburg, in Holland, lived a spectacle-maker named Zachary\r\nJansen, and his sons, when playing with the lenses in the shop,\r\nhappened to fix two of them at the proper distance, and then to look\r\nthrough both. To the astonishment of the boys, they perceived an\r\ninverted image of the church weathercock much nearer and much larger\r\nthan usual. They at once told their father what they had seen. He fixed\r\nthe glasses in a tube, and having satisfied himself that his sons were\r\ncorrect, thought little more about the matter. This is the story as\r\ntold, but there is little doubt that for the first Telescope the world\r\nwas indebted either to Hans Lippersheim or Joseph Adriansz, the former\r\na spectacle-maker of Middleburg; and in October 1608, Lippersheim\r\npresented to the Government three instruments, with which he “could\r\nsee things at a distance.” Jansen came after this. The report of the\r\ninvention soon spread, and Galileo, who was then in Venice, eagerly\r\nseized upon the idea, and returning to Padua with some lenses, he\r\nmanaged to construct a telescope, and began to study the heavens. This\r\nwas in 1609. _Galileo’s Tube_ became celebrated, and all the first\r\ntelescopes were made with the concave eye-lens. Rheita, a monk, made\r\na binocular telescope, as now used in our opera- and field-glasses\r\napproximately.\r\n\r\nBut the prismatic colours which showed themselves in the early\r\ntelescopes were not got rid of, nor was it till 1729 that Hall, by\r\nstudying the mechanism of the eye, managed a combination of lenses\r\nfree from colour. Ten years before (in 1718) Hadley had established\r\nthe Reflector Telescope; Herschel made his celebrated forty-foot\r\n“reflector” in 1789.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.—The Microscope.]\r\n\r\nHowever, to resume. In 1747, Euler declared that it was quite possible\r\nto construct an arrangement of lenses so as to obtain a colourless\r\nimage, but he was at first challenged by John Dollond. The latter,\r\nhowever, was afterwards induced to make experiments with prisms of\r\ncrown and flint glass. He then tried lenses, and with a concave lens\r\nof flint, and a convex lens of crown, he corrected the colours. The\r\nquestion of proper curvature was finally settled, and the “Achromatic”\r\nTelescope became an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of Telescopes—the reflecting and refracting. Lord\r\nRosse’s is an instance of the former. Mr. Grubb’s immense instrument in\r\nDublin is a refractor.\r\n\r\nThe Microscope has been also attributed to Zacharias Jansen, and\r\nDrebbel, in 1619, possessed the instrument in London, but it was of\r\nlittle or no use. The lens invented by Hall, as already mentioned,\r\ngave an impetus to the Microscope. In the simple Microscope the\r\nobjects are seen directly through the lens or lenses acting as one.\r\nThe compound instrument is composed of two lenses (or a number formed\r\nto do duty as two), an eye-lens, and an object-lens. Between these is\r\na “stop” to restrain all light, except what is necessary to view the\r\nobject distinctly. The large glass near the object bends the rays on\r\nto the eyeglass, and a perfect magnified image is perceived. We annex\r\ndiagrams, from which the construction will be readily understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.—Image on the Retina.]\r\n\r\nWe have in the previous chapter mentioned the effect of light upon the\r\neye and its direction, and when an object is placed very near the eye\r\nwe know it cannot be distinctly seen; a magnified image is thrown upon\r\nthe retina, and the divergency of the rays prevents a clear image being\r\nperceived. But if a small lens of a short “focal length” be placed in\r\nfront of the eye, having PQ for its focus, the rays of light\r\nwill be parallel, or very nearly so, and will as such produce “distinct\r\nvision,” and the image will be magnified at _pq_. In the Compound\r\nRefracting Microscope, BAB is the convex lens, near which an\r\nobject, PQ, is placed a little beyond its focal length. An\r\ninverted image, _pq_, will then be formed. This image is produced in\r\nthe convex lens, _bab′_, and when the rays are reflected out they are\r\nparallel, and are distinctly seen. So the eye of the observer at the\r\npoint E will see a magnified image of the object at PQ brought up to\r\n_pq_ (fig. 155).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.—The Microscope lenses.]\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton suggested the Reflecting Microscope, and Dr. Wollaston\r\nand Sir David Brewster improved the instrument called the “Periscopic\r\nMicroscope,” in which two hemispherical lenses were cemented together\r\nby the plane surfaces, and having a “stop” between them to limit the\r\naperture. Then the “Achromatic” instrument came into use, and since\r\nthen the Microscope has gradually attained perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.—Concave lens.]\r\n\r\nWe have so frequently mentioned lenses that it may be as well to\r\nsay something about them. Lenses may be spherical, double-convex,\r\nplane-convex, plane-concave, double-concave, and concave-convex. Convex\r\nlenses bring the parallel lines which strike them to a focus, as we see\r\nin the “burning-glass.” The concave or hollow lens appears as in fig.\r\n156. The rays that follow it parallel to its axis are refracted, and as\r\nif they came from a point F in the diagram. But converging rays falling\r\non it emerge in a parallel direction as above, or diverge as in fig.\r\n158.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. 1. Focus of parallel rays. 2. Focus of\r\ndivergent rays. 3. Focus of divergent rays brought forward by more\r\nconvex lens.]\r\n\r\nThe use of spectacles to long or short-sighted people is a necessity,\r\nand the lenses used vary. The eye has usually the capacity of suiting\r\nitself to viewing objects—its accommodation, as it is termed—near or\r\nfar. But when the forepart of the eye is curved, and cannot adapt\r\nitself to distant objects, the person is said to be short-sighted. In\r\nlong sight the axis of the eyeball is too short, and the focus falls\r\nbeyond the retina; in short sight it is too long. In the diagrams\r\nherewith fig. 159 shows by the dotted lines the position of the retina\r\nin long sight, and fig. 160 in short sight, the clear lines showing in\r\neach case the perfectly-formed eye. For long sight and old sight the\r\ndouble-convex glass is used, for short sight the double-concave (fig.\r\n162). We know the burning-glass gives us a small image of the sun as\r\nit converges the rays to its focus. But lenses will do more than this,\r\nand in the PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERA we find great interest and\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.—Diverging rays.]\r\n\r\nPhotography (or writing by light) depends upon the property which\r\ncertain preparations possess of being blackened by exposure to light\r\nwhile in contact with matter. By an achromatic arrangement of lenses\r\nthe camera gives us a representation of the desired object Fig. 163\r\nshows the image on the plate, and figs. 164 and 165 the arrangement of\r\nlenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.—Hypermetropia (long sight)..]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.—Myopia (short sight).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.—Concave and convex lenses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.—Lenses for long and short sight.]\r\n\r\nTo Porta, the Neapolitan physician, whose name we have already\r\nmentioned more than once, is due the first idea of the Photographic\r\nCamera. He found that if light was admitted through a small aperture,\r\nobjects from which rays reached the hole would be reflected on the\r\nwall like a picture. To this fact we are indebted for the CAMERA\r\nOBSCURA, which receives the picture upon a plane surface by\r\nan arrangement of lenses. In fact, Porta nearly arrived at the\r\nDaguerreotype process. He thought he could teach people to draw by\r\nfollowing the focussed picture with a crayon, but he could not conquer\r\nthe aërial perspective.\r\n\r\nSo the camera languished till 1820, when Wedgwood and Sir Humphrey Davy\r\nattempted to obtain some views with nitrate of silver, but they became\r\nobliterated when exposed to the daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.—The Camera.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1814, however, M. Niepce had made a series of experiments\r\nin photography, and subsequently having heard that M. Daguerre was\r\nturning his attention to the same subject, he communicated with\r\nhim. In 1827 a paper was read before the Royal Society, and in 1829\r\na partnership deed was drawn up between Daguerre and Niepce for\r\n“copying engravings by photography.” Daguerre worked hard, and at\r\nlength succeeded in obtaining a picture by a long process, to which,\r\nperhaps, some of our readers are indebted for their likenesses forty\r\nyears ago. By means of iodine evaporated on a metal plate covered with\r\n“gold-yellow,” and exposing the plate then in a second box to mercurial\r\nvapour, he marked the image in the camera, and then he immersed the\r\nplate in hyposulphate of soda, and was able to expose the image\r\nobtained to daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 164.      Arrangement of lenses      Fig. 165.]\r\n\r\nBut the mode now in use is the “collodion” process. We have all seen\r\nthe photographer pouring the iodized collodion on the plate, and\r\nletting the superfluous liquid drain from a corner of the glass. When\r\nit is dry the glass-plate is dipped into a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver, and then in a few minutes the glass is ready. The focus is\r\nthen arranged, and the prepared plate conveyed in a special slide—to\r\nkeep it from the light—to the camera. When the “patient” is ready, the\r\ncovering of the lens is removed, and the light works the image into\r\nthe sensitive plate. The impression is then “brought up,” and when\r\ndeveloped is washed in water, and after by a solution which dissolves\r\nall the silver from the parts not darkened by the light. Thus the\r\nnegative is obtained and printed from in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nInstantaneous photography is now practised with great success. An\r\nexpress train, or the movements of a horse at full speed, can thus\r\nbe taken in a second or less. These results are obtained by using\r\nprepared plates, and the “emulsion process,” as it is called, succeeds\r\nadmirably. The mode of preparation is given in a late work upon the\r\nsubject, and the photographic plates may also be obtained ready for\r\nuse. Gelatine and water, mixed with bromide of ammonium, nitrate of\r\nsilver, and carbonate of ammonium, mixed with certain proportions of\r\nwater, form the “emulsion.” We need not go into all the details here.\r\nInformation can easily be obtained from published works, and as the\r\nplates can be purchased by amateurs, they will find that the best way.\r\n\r\nAside from the art interest in the new plates is quite another, that\r\nsprings from the fact that it is now possible to take pictures of men,\r\nanimals, and machinery in rapid motion, thus enabling us to view them\r\nin a way that would be impossible with the unaided eye. The first\r\nexperiments in this direction were applied to the movements of a horse\r\nmoving at full speed. The pictures, taken in series, showed that he\r\nperformed muscular actions that were not before comprehended or even\r\nimagined. These pictures at the time attracted great attention, and\r\ninstantaneous pictures have been since taken of dancers in a ball-room,\r\nof vessels and steam-boats in rapid movement, of all kinds of animals\r\nin motion, and of machinery in operation. As the pictures represent the\r\nmovements at one instant of time, they give, as it were, a fixed view\r\nof a motion, precisely as if it were suddenly arrested in full action.\r\nIn the case of animals, the motions of the nostrils are represented in\r\nthe most singular manner, and the spokes of a steam-boat’s paddle-wheel\r\nare shown apparently perfectly still while the spray and waves appear\r\nin active motion, or, rather, as they would look if they could be\r\ninstantly frozen. It is clear the new process and pictures will open a\r\nwide and instructive field in art and in the study of mechanical action.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of Photography we may mention a very ingenious\r\nlittle apparatus called a SCENOGRAPH, the invention of Dr.\r\nCandize. It is really a pocket-camera, and is so easily manipulated\r\nthat it will be found a most pleasant and useful holiday companion.\r\nAny one may obtain good results with it, and friends of ours have had\r\noccasion to put it in practice during a series of excursions, when it\r\nwas found to answer in every instance.\r\n\r\nThe Scenograph is something like a common Stereoscope in outward\r\nappearance, and would, perhaps, be at first regarded as a mere toy,\r\ndid not a more intimate acquaintance prove it a great acquisition,\r\nparticularly to explorers and tourists. The tripod stand which supports\r\nthe apparatus is, when not in actual use in that capacity, a very\r\nexcellent walking-stick, in which the two other “legs” are carried. The\r\ninstrument, as will be perceived from the illustration (fig. 166),\r\nis very handy. It produces pictures about the “cabinet” size, and the\r\nwhole is so arranged that it can be packed and carried in the pocket\r\nwith ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.—The Scenograph.]\r\n\r\nPhotography, as a rule, necessitates a dark room or cabinet, and\r\nmany preparations as we all know—a “messing” about with chemicals\r\nand considerable practice before we can become proficient; so it is\r\nnot surprising that few amateurs take to it—they prefer to purchase\r\nthe pictures. But in the new apparatus of which we are speaking, the\r\nglass plates are already prepared to receive the image. It is not at\r\nall necessary for the operator to stain his fingers and knuckles and\r\nnails with nitrate of silver, or any other “chemicals” whatever. He\r\njust inserts the plate in the Scenograph, and then his apparatus being\r\nsteadily set up, he removes the covering from the lens. To develop the\r\nimage (in the dusk of the evening or by candle-light) it is necessary\r\nto put some drops of ammonia in a saucer, breathe upon the plate so\r\nas to soften the collodion, and hold it above the ammonia, and then,\r\nunder the influence of the vapour, the picture will appear. After this\r\nsimple operation the picture will be found fixed for a lengthened\r\nperiod—practically indefinitely. Thus on the return of the pedestrian\r\nhe can reproduce, at small expense, a whole series of little pictures\r\nfaithfully representing his holiday tour. The illustration shows a\r\nsmall apparatus by which on thin plates small photographs can be taken\r\nand fixed till it is found desirable to enlarge them.\r\n\r\nThe _Photophone_, one of the most recent contributions to science,\r\nis an instrument which, in combination with the telephone principle,\r\nmakes it possible to convey sounds by means of a ray of light, and by\r\nmeans of a quivering beam “to produce articulate speech at a distance.\r\nThe success of the Photophone depends upon a rare element, selenium,\r\nwhich has its “electrical resistance” affected by light. Professor\r\nAdams demonstrated that the resistance of selenium was reduced just\r\nin proportion as the intensity of the light which was acting upon it.\r\nHere was the key to the Photophone as thought out by Professor Bell.\r\nHe fancied that he might by means of his telephone produce sound if he\r\ncould vary the intensity of the beam of light upon the selenium, which\r\nhe connected with his telephone and battery.\r\n\r\nThe Photophone consists of a transmitter for receiving the voice and\r\nconveying it along the beam of light, and a receiver for taking the\r\nlight and converting it into sound—the receiver being the telephone.\r\nThere is a small mirror (silvered mica has been used) suspended freely\r\nfor vibration. A lens is used to transmit to this the beam of light,\r\nand this beam is again reflected by another lens to the receiver, which\r\nconsists of a reflector which has a cell of selenium in its focus,\r\nconnected, as already stated, with the telephone and battery. The\r\nspeaker stands behind the mirror, and the sound of his voice against\r\nthe reverse side makes it vibrate in unison with the sounds uttered.\r\nThe movements cause a quivering in the reflected beam, and this in its\r\nchanging intensity acts on the selenium, which changes its resistance\r\naccordingly, and through the telephone gives forth a sound!\r\n\r\nThis is the apparently complicated but really simple, and at the same\r\ntime wonderful, invention of Professor Bell. By the Photophone not\r\nonly sounds but _movements_ can be converted into sound; even the\r\n_burning of a candle can be heard_! The Photophone is still capable of\r\nimprovement, and has not as yet arrived at its full development, for it\r\nis stated it can be made quite independent of a battery or telephone.\r\n\r\nThere are many phenomena connected with the _Polarization of Light_.\r\nThis requires some notice at our hands. We know that a ray of ordinary\r\nlight is supposed to be caused by vibrations of the highly attenuated\r\nmedium, æther. These vibrations occur across the direction of the\r\nray; but when they occur only _in one plane_ the light is said to be\r\n“polarized.” Polarization means possessing poles (like a magnet); the\r\npolarized rays have “sides,” as Newton said, or, as explained by Dr.\r\nWhewell, “opposite properties in opposite directions, so exactly equal\r\nas to be capable of accurately neutralizing each other.” There are some\r\ncrystals which possess the property of “double refraction,” and thus\r\na ray of common light passing through such a crystal is divided into\r\ntwo _polarized_ rays, taking different directions. One is refracted\r\naccording to the usual laws of refraction; the other is not, and the\r\nplanes of polarization are at right angles. It is difficult within the\r\nlimits of this chapter to explain the whole theory of Polarization. In\r\norder to account for certain phenomena in optics, philosophers have\r\nassumed that rays possess polarity; and polarized light is light which\r\nhas had the property of Polarization conferred upon it by reflection,\r\nrefraction, or absorption. Common light has been compared to a round\r\nruler, and polarized light to a flat ribbon. Huygens found out, when\r\nengaged upon the investigation of double refraction, that the rays of\r\nlight, divided by passing through a crystal (a rhomb) of Iceland spar,\r\npossessed certain qualities. When he passed them through a second\r\nrhomb, he found that the brightness, relatively, of the rays depended\r\nupon the position of the second prism, and in some positions one ray\r\ndisappeared entirely. The light had been reduced to vibrations in one\r\nplane. In 1808, Malus, happening to direct a double refracting prism\r\nto the windows then reflecting the sunset, found that as he turned the\r\nprism round, the ordinary image of the window nearly disappeared in two\r\nopposite positions; and in two other positions, at right angles, the\r\n“extraordinary” image nearly vanished. So he found that polarization\r\nwas produced by reflection as well as by transmission. The differences\r\nbetween common and polarized light have been summed up by Mr. Goddard\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n        COMMON LIGHT                         POLARIZED LIGHT\r\n\r\n  “Is capable of reflection at         “Is capable of reflection at\r\n  oblique angles of incidence in       oblique angles only in\r\n  every position of the reflector.     _certain positions_ of the\r\n                                       reflector.\r\n\r\n  “Will pass through a bundle of       “Will only pass through such\r\n  plates of glass in any position      glasses when they are in\r\n  in which they may be placed.         _certain positions_.\r\n\r\n  “Will pass through a plate of        “Will only pass in certain\r\n  tourmaline, cut parallel to the       positions, and in others\r\n  axis of the crystal, in every         will not pass at all.”\r\n  position of the plate.”\r\n\r\nThe bundle of glass plates or the tourmaline plate is thus the test for\r\npolarized light, and is termed an analyzer.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement called a “Nichol’s prism,” made by cutting a prism\r\nof Iceland spar and uniting the halves with a cement, so that only\r\none polarized ray can pass through it, is termed a _Polarizer_. It\r\nonly permits one of the two rays produced by “double refraction” to\r\npass, and the ray (as said above) will contain none but transverse\r\nvibrations. Polarized light will produce beautiful colours. The whole\r\nsubject is very interesting to the scientist, but rather a difficult\r\none for the general reader to understand.\r\n\r\nAmongst the uses to which light has been put is that of a milk-tester.\r\nThe LACTOSCOPE will show the quantity of butter contained in\r\na certain quantity of milk, by diluting it till it displays a certain\r\ndegree of transparency. There is another method, by the transmission of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe first test is obtained by means of a glass tube about nine inches\r\nlong, closed at one end, and containing a small porcelain rod marked\r\nwith black lines. A small quantity of milk is measured and placed in\r\nthe tube. The black lines cannot at first be seen through the tube, but\r\nby adding water the milk is rendered transparent, and the black lines\r\nbecome visible. The surface of milk in the tube, by a graduated scale\r\nupon it, shows the percentage of butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.—Cut card figures.]\r\n\r\nThe second method is not so simple. A short tube of tin, blackened on\r\nthe inside, and supported upright, has an opening on one side, and\r\nopposite this, inside the tube, is a mirror placed at an angle of 45°.\r\n“By placing a lighted candle at a known distance opposite the opening,\r\nits light is reflected in the mirror and thrown upward through the\r\ntube. On top of the tube is placed a round vessel of glass or metal,\r\nclosed at the bottom by a sheet of clear glass. The vessel is closed at\r\nthe top by a cover having an opening in the centre, in which slides up\r\nand down a small tube closed at the bottom with glass, and having an\r\neye-piece at the top. The milk to be tested is placed in this vessel on\r\nthe top of the tin tube, so that the light of the candle reflected from\r\nthe mirror passes upward through the milk. Then, by looking through the\r\nsliding tube and moving it up and down, a point may be found where the\r\nimage of the candle in the mirror can be seen through the milk. This\r\ndevice depends, as will be seen, on observing the light transmitted\r\nthrough a film of milk, and the thickness of the film is the measure of\r\nthe value of the milk. The movable tube contains a graduated scale, and\r\nby comparison of this with a printed table, the percentage of butter in\r\nthe milk may be ascertained.”\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter we give a few hints for some pleasant\r\nrelaxation for young people, which has many a time created amusement.\r\nThe experiment consists in cutting out in paper or cardboard certain\r\nportions of a face or figure, as per the illustration herewith. Fig.\r\n167 gives the card as cut with the scissors, and the two subsequent\r\nfaces are the result of the same held at a less or greater distance\r\nfrom a screen. The illustrations (fig. 168) will assist those who wish\r\nto amuse children by making rabbits, etc., on the wall. The shadows\r\nwill be seen perfectly thrown if the hands be carefully fixed near a\r\ngood light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.—Hand-shadows on the wall.]\r\n\r\nWe are all so familiar with the “Magic Lantern,” and the apparatus\r\nfor dissolving views by an arrangement of lenses and manipulation of\r\nslides, that we need do no more than refer to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.—Dissolving views apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe various ghost illusions, etc., produced by indirect mirrors, have\r\nalready been referred to, the ghost being merely the reflection of an\r\nindividual seen through a sheet of glass between the spectators and\r\nthe stage. The strong light throws a reflection from a parallel mirror\r\nlower down, and this reflected image can be made to appear amongst\r\nthe real actors who are behind the plate-glass in full view of the\r\naudience, who are, however, ignorant of the existence of the glass\r\nscreen.\r\n\r\nFor the winter evenings one may easily procure an apparatus for\r\ndissolving views by the oxy-hydrogen light. One, as shown in the\r\nillustration herewith (fig. 169), will answer every purpose, and by\r\nthis double arrangement phantasmagoria may be produced, or a fairy\r\ntale may be illustrated. The effect of gradually-approaching night\r\nmay be given to the picture by means of a special glass in the lower\r\nlanthorn. The apparatus is exhibited by means of a Drummond light, and\r\nis very simple, although a certain supply of gas is necessary for the\r\nperformance. But this can be easily procured by an indiarubber tube,\r\nor in a bag supplied for the purpose. Almost any objects can be used,\r\nphotographs, etc., etc., and many very comical arrangements can be made.\r\n\r\nWe have lately been reading a curious method of obtaining light\r\nfrom oyster-shells in a Trans-Atlantic magazine. We give an extract\r\nwherewith to close this chapter. The compound is “luminous paint.”\r\n\r\n“It has been known that certain compounds of lime and sulphur had the\r\nproperty of absorbing light, and giving it out again when placed in\r\nthe dark. A simple way to do this is to expose clean oyster-shells to\r\na red heat for half an hour. When cold, the best pieces are picked out\r\nand packed with alternate layers of sulphur in a crucible, and exposed\r\nto a red heat for an hour. When cold, the mass is broken up, and the\r\nwhitest pieces are placed in a clean glass bottle. On exposing the\r\nbottle to bright sunshine during the day, it is found that at night its\r\ncontents will give out a pale light in the dark. Such a bottle filled\r\nmore than a hundred years ago still gives out light when exposed to\r\nthe sun, proving the persistency of the property of reproducing light.\r\nVery many experiments have been more recently made in this direction,\r\nand the light-giving property greatly enhanced. The chemicals, ground\r\nto a flour, may now be mixed with oils or water for paints, may be\r\npowdered on hot glass, and glass covered with a film of clear glass,\r\nor mixed with celluloid, papier-maché, or other plastic materials. As\r\na paint, it may be applied to a diver’s dress, to cards, clock dials,\r\nsign-boards, and other surfaces exposed to sunlight during the day;\r\nthe paint gives out a pale violet light at night sufficient to enable\r\nthe objects to be readily seen in the dark. If the object covered with\r\nthe prepared paint is not exposed to the sun, or if the light fades in\r\nthe dark, a short piece of magnesium wire burned before it serves to\r\nrestore the light-giving property.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSPECTRAL ILLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n A SPECTRE VISIBLE—CURIOUS ILLUSIONS—GHOSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already given numerous examples of the effects produced\r\nby impressions on the retina by mechanical appliances. We can now\r\nin a short chapter speak of the cause of many spectral illusions,\r\ncommonly supposed to be “ghosts” or “spirits.” That there are many\r\n“well-authenticated ‘ghost stories’” no one can doubt who has read the\r\nliterature of the day; and we ourselves do not in any way desire to\r\nthrow any doubt upon the existence of certain so-called “ghosts.” That\r\nappearances of some kind or another are seen by people we know. We\r\nourselves have seen such, but we cannot say we believe in the popular\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times mirrors were much employed by the so-called magicians,\r\nand in our day many wonderful ghost effects have been shown at\r\nthe (late) Polytechnic Institution. Some people are believers in\r\ntable-turning and spiritualism, and mesmerists still attract large\r\naudiences, and appear to possess extraordinary power over some\r\nindividuals. But apparitions have been seen by people eminently worthy\r\nof credit. The experience of the learned Doctor, which appeared some\r\nmonths ago in the _Athenæum_, is a case in point. This narrative is\r\nconcise and clear. The spectre was there. How did it get there? Was the\r\n“appearance” objective or subjective? Let us give an extract from the\r\nReverend Doctor’s narrative, and comment upon it afterwards. We may\r\npremise that Dr. Jessopp had gone over to Lord Orford’s (Mannington\r\nHall), and at eleven o’clock was busy writing in the library, and was\r\n“the only person downstairs.” We will give this ghost story in the\r\nDoctor’s own words. After taking up a certain volume—time about 1 a.m.:—\r\n\r\n“I had been engaged on it about half an hour, and was beginning to\r\nthink my work was drawing to a close, when, as I was actually writing,\r\nI saw a large white hand within a foot of my elbow. Turning my head,\r\nthere sat a figure of a somewhat large man with his back to the fire,\r\nbending slightly over the table, and apparently examining the pile of\r\nbooks that I had been at work upon.”... After describing the appearance\r\nof the nocturnal visitor, Dr. Jessopp proceeds:—\r\n\r\n“There he sat, and I was fascinated; afraid not of his staying, but\r\nlest he should go. Stopping in my writing I lifted my left hand from\r\nthe paper, stretched it out to the pile of books, and moved the top\r\none—my arm passed in front of the figure, and it vanished.”... Shortly\r\nafter the figure appeared again, and “I was penning a sentence to\r\naddress to him, when I discovered I did not dare to speak. I was afraid\r\nof the sound of my own voice! There he sat, and there sat I. I turned\r\nmy head and finished writing. Having finished my task, I shut the book,\r\nand threw it on the table; it made a slight noise as it fell;—the\r\nfigure vanished.”\r\n\r\nNow here we have a perfectly plain narrative, clear and full. A ghost\r\nappeared; he is described distinctly. How can we account for the\r\napparition? In the first place, someone might have played a trick, but\r\nthat idea was put aside by Dr. Wilks, who attempted to explain the\r\nappearances. He went fully into the question, and as it bears upon our\r\nexplanation of the reality of Spectral Illusions, we may condense his\r\nevidence. It will of course be conceded that all the usual objects seen\r\nby people are material, and the image of what we look at is formed upon\r\nthe retina in the manner already explained. But _all_ images upon the\r\nretina are not immediately observed; the impression may, to a certain\r\nextent, remain. Words are often impressed upon the brain,—words which\r\nwe in our sober senses would never think of repeating,—and yet when\r\nwe are delirious we give vent to these expressions, of whose very\r\nnature and meaning we are perfectly unconscious. It is, according to\r\nour reference (Dr. Wilks), “quite possible for the perceptive part of\r\nthe brain to be thrown into an active condition quite independent of\r\nthe normal stimulus conducted to it from the retina.” If, under these\r\ncircumstances, an object be viewed independently, and, as it were,\r\nunconsciously, it is merely, we believe, a parallel to the impression\r\nof words before noted. Sound and light are governed by the same laws.\r\nIn fevers we fancy we see all kinds of things which have no existence.\r\nIn dreams we hear noises; and many a time people dreaming have been\r\nawakened by the report of a gun, or the ringing of a bell which had no\r\nmaterial origin,—the nerves were excited, the “perceptive centre” of\r\nthe brain was moved.\r\n\r\nBut if sight and hearing thus have their origin from the _brain_\r\nand not from without, there must have been some predisposing\r\ncause, some excitement to induce such a condition of things. “The\r\nimpressions become abnormal and subjective,—the normal condition being\r\nobjective,—the impression is received from without, and impressed upon\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\nNow, let us consider the “ghost”! Lately there have been many instances\r\nbrought forward of “spiritual” appearances, but we think nobody has\r\never seen a “_material_” ghost; yet on the other hand none of us\r\nhave any knowledge of anything in the likeness of a ghost, or that\r\n_has not a material basis_ which _can_ bring forward an image on the\r\nretina! Therefore we are brought to the conclusion that apparitions\r\nare spectres emanating from within the brain, not from any outward\r\nmanifestation, because it is within the experience of everybody that in\r\nbad health, or disordered digestive functions, images are produced in\r\nthe brain and nerves of the eye.\r\n\r\nThese remarks have perhaps been made before in one form or other, but\r\nas much popular interest is always awakened by the supernatural, or\r\nwhat is supposed to be supernatural, we may go a little farther, and\r\ninquire how it was that the ghost seen by Dr. Jessopp disappeared when\r\nhe raised his arm. Would any ghost be afraid of the Doctor extending\r\nhis hand? The fact no doubt occurred as related. The explanation is\r\nthat the narrator had been much impressed by a certain picture, which\r\na correspondent soon identified as a portrait of “Parsons, the Jesuit\r\nFather.” The description given is that of the priest who was described\r\nby the Doctor in one of his books. The association of ideas in the\r\nlibrary of a Norfolk house connected with the Walpoles, with whom\r\nParsons had been a leader, gave rise, during a period of “forty winks”\r\nat midnight, to the spectre.\r\n\r\nIn the interesting letters written upon “Natural Magic” by Sir David\r\nBrewster, the subject of Spectral Illusions is treated at some length,\r\nand with undoubted authority. Sir David thought the subject worth\r\ndiscussing with reference to the illusions or spectres mentioned by Dr.\r\nHibbert. Sir David Brewster gives his own experiences which occurred\r\nwhile he was staying at the house of a lady in the country.\r\n\r\nThe illusions appear to have affected her ear as well as the eye.\r\nWe shall see in the next chapter how intimately sound and light are\r\nconnected, and how the eyes and ears are equally impressed, though in\r\na different way, by the vibration of particles. The lady referred to\r\nwas about to go upstairs to dress for dinner one afternoon, when she\r\nheard her husband’s voice calling to her by name. She opened the door,\r\nand nobody was outside; and when she returned for a moment to the fire\r\nshe heard the voice again calling, “Come to me; come, come away,” in a\r\nsomewhat impatient tone. She immediately went in search of her husband,\r\nbut he did not come in till half an hour afterwards, and of course said\r\nhe had not called, and told her where he had been at the time—some\r\ndistance away. This happened on the 26th December, 1830, but a more\r\nalarming occurrence took place four days after.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in the afternoon of the 30th December, the lady\r\ncame into the drawing-room, and to her great astonishment she perceived\r\nher husband standing with his back to the fireplace. She had seen him\r\ngo out walking a short time previously, and was naturally surprised\r\nto find he had returned so soon. He looked at her very thoughtfully,\r\nand made no answer. She sat down close beside him at the fire, and as\r\nhe still gazed upon her she said, “Why don’t you say something!” The\r\nfigure immediately moved away towards the window at the farther end of\r\nthe room, still gazing at her, “and it passed so close that she was\r\nstruck by the circumstance of hearing no step nor sound, nor feeling\r\nher dress brushed against, nor even any agitation of the air.” Although\r\nconvinced this was not her husband, the lady never fancied there was\r\nanything supernatural in the appearance of the figure. Subsequently she\r\nwas convinced that it was a spectral illusion, although she could not\r\nsee through the figure which appeared as substantial as the reality.\r\n\r\nWere it advisable, we could multiply instances. In the _Edinburgh\r\nJournal of Science_ these, and many more instances of spectral\r\nillusions were narrated by the husband of the lady. She frequently\r\nbeheld deceased relatives or absent friends, and described their dress\r\nand general appearance very minutely. On one occasion she perceived\r\na coach full of skeletons drive up to the door, and noticed spectral\r\ndogs and cats (her own pets’ likenesses) in the room. There can be no\r\ndoubt upon these points; the appearances were manifest and distinct.\r\nThey were seen in the presence of other people, in solitude, and in\r\nthe society of her husband. The lady was in delicate health, and very\r\nsensitive. The spectres appeared in daylight as well as in the dark, or\r\nby candle-light.\r\n\r\nLet us now, guided by what we have already written, and by Sir David\r\nBrewster’s experience, endeavour to give a rational explanation of\r\nthese illusions. “The mind’s eye is really the body’s eye, and the\r\nretina is the common tablet upon which both classes of impressions are\r\npainted, and by means of which they receive their visual existence\r\naccording to the same optical laws.”\r\n\r\n“In the healthy state of mind and body the relative intensity of the\r\ntwo classes of impressions on the retina are nicely adjusted—the bodily\r\nand mental are balanced. The latter are feeble and transient, and in\r\nordinary temperaments are never capable of disturbing or effacing\r\nthe direct images of visible objects.... The mind cannot perform\r\ntwo different functions at the same instant, and the direction of\r\nits attention to one of the two classes of impressions necessarily\r\nproduces the extinction of the other; but so rapid is the exercise of\r\nmental power, that the alternate appearance and disappearance of the\r\ntwo contending impressions is no more recognized than the successive\r\nobservations of external objects during the twinkling of the eyelids.”\r\n\r\nWe have before illustrated, by means of the pen and the ink-bottle, how\r\none object is lost sight of when the other is attentively regarded, and\r\na material picture or scene may be equally lost sight of, and a mental\r\npicture take its place in the eye, when we recall places or people we\r\nhave seen or remembered.\r\n\r\nWe have all heard numerous anecdotes of what is termed\r\n“absent-mindedness.” Some people are quite absorbed in study, and\r\ncan see or hear no one in the room when deeply occupied. We may be\r\nsatisfied then that “pictures of the mind and spectral illusions are\r\nequally impressions upon the retina, and only differ in the degree\r\nof vividness with which they are seen.” If we press our eyes the\r\nphosphorescence becomes apparent, and we can make a picture of the sun\r\nor a lamp visible for a long time to our closed eyes if we stare at\r\neither object for a few seconds, and shut our lids. So by increasing\r\nthe sensibility of the retina we can obtain the image, and alter its\r\ncolour by pressure on the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that poisons will affect sight, and belladonna\r\napplied to the eyes will so affect them as to render the sight _nil_,\r\nby enlargement of the “pupil.” If one is out of health there is\r\npractically a poisoning of the system, and when we have a “bilious\r\nheadache” we see colours and stars because there is a pressure upon the\r\nblood-vessels of the eye. The effects of a disordered stomach, induced\r\nby drinking too much, are well known; objects are seen double, and most\r\nghosts may be traced to a disordered state of health of mind or body,\r\nbrought on by excitement or fatigue. We could relate a series of ghost\r\nstories,—some in our own experience, for we have seen a ghost equally\r\nwith our neighbours,—but this is not the place for them. Although many\r\napparently incontrovertible assertions are made, and many spectres have\r\nbeen produced to adorn a tale, we must put on record our own opinion,\r\nthat every one could be traced to mental impression or bodily affection\r\nhad we only the key to the life and circumstances of the ghost-seer.\r\nMany celebrated conjurers will convince us almost against our reason\r\nthat our pocket-handkerchief is in the orange just cut up. They will\r\nbring live rabbits from our coat-pockets or vests, and pigeons from our\r\nopera-hats. These are equally illusions. We know what can be done with\r\nmirrors. We have seen ghosts at the Polytechnic, but we must put down\r\nall apparitions as the result of mental or bodily, even unconscious\r\nimpressions upon the retina of the eye. There are numerous illusions,\r\nsuch as the Fata Morgana, the Spectre of the Brocken, etc., which\r\nare due to a peculiar state of the atmosphere, and to the unequal\r\nreflection and refraction of light. Those, and many other optical\r\nphenomena, will, with phenomena of heat and sound, be treated under\r\nMETEOROLOGY, when we will consider the rainbow and the aurora,\r\nwith many other atmospheric effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nACOUSTICS.\r\n\r\n THE EAR, AND HEARING—PHYSIOLOGY OF HEARING AND SOUND—SOUND AS COMPARED\r\n WITH LIGHT—WHAT IS SOUND?—VELOCITY OF SOUND—CONDUCTIBILITY—THE\r\n HARMONOGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the science of ACOUSTICS, a short\r\ndescription of the ear, and the mode in which sound is conveyed to our\r\nbrain, will be no doubt acceptable to our readers. The study of the\r\norgans of hearing is not an easy one; although we can see the exterior\r\nportion, the interior and delicate membranes are hidden from us in the\r\nvery hardest bone of the body—the _petrous_ bone, the temporal and\r\nrock-like bone of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 170.—1. Temple bone. 2. Outer surface of temple. 3. Upper wall\r\n of bony part of hearing canal. 4. Ligature holding “hammer” bone to\r\n roof of drum cavity. 5. Roof to drum cavity. 6.

Mouth of\r\n auditory canal. 21. Anti-tragus.]\r\n\r\nThe ear (external) is composed of the auricle, the visible ear, the\r\nauditory canal, and the drum-head, or _membra tympani_. The tympanum,\r\nor “drum,” is situated between the external and the internal portions\r\nof the ear. This part is the “middle ear,” and is an air cavity, and\r\nthrough it pass two nerves, one to the face, and the other to the\r\ntongue. The internal ear is called the “labyrinth,” from its intricate\r\nstructure. We give an illustration of the auditory apparatus of man\r\n(fig. 170).\r\n\r\nThe auricle, or exterior ear, is also represented, but we need not go\r\ninto any minute description of the parts. We will just name them (fig.\r\n171).\r\n\r\nSound is the motion imparted to the auditory nerve, and we shall see\r\nin a moment how sound is produced. The undulations enter the auditory\r\ncanal, having been taken up by the auricle; the waves or vibrations\r\nmove at the rate of 1,100 feet a second, and reach the drum-head,\r\nwhich has motion imparted to it. This motion or oscillation is\r\nimparted to other portions, and through the liquid in the labyrinth.\r\nThe impressions of the sound wave are conveyed to the nerve, and this\r\nperception of the movement in the water of the labyrinth by the nerve\r\nthreads and the brain causes what we term “hearing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.—1. Pit of anti-helix. 2, 6, 10. Curved edge\r\nof the auricle. 3. Mouth of auditory canal. 4. Tragus. 5. Lobe. 7.\r\nAnti-helix. 8. Concha. 9. Anti-tragus.]\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to explain what sound is, and how it arises. There\r\nare some curious parallels between sound and light. When speaking of\r\nlight we mentioned some of the analogies between sound and light, and\r\nas we proceed to consider sound, we will not lose sight of the light we\r\nhave just passed by.\r\n\r\nSound is the influence of air in motion upon the hearing or auditory\r\nnerves. Light, as we have seen, is the ether in motion, the vibrations\r\nstriking the nerves of the eye.\r\n\r\nThere are musical and unmusical sounds. The former are audible when the\r\nvibrations of the air reach our nerves at regular intervals. Unmusical\r\nsounds, or irregular vibrations, create _noise_. Now, musical tones\r\nbear the same relation to the ear as colours do to the eye. We must\r\nhave a certain number of vibrations of ether to give us a certain\r\ncolour (_vide_ table). “About four hundred and fifty billion impulses\r\nin a second” give red light. The violet rays require nearly double. So\r\nwe obtain colours by the different rate of the impingement of impulses\r\non the retina. The eyes, as we have already learned, cannot receive\r\nany more rapidly-recurring impressions than those producing violet,\r\nalthough as proved, the spectrum is by no means exhausted, even if they\r\nare invisible. In the consideration of Calorescence we pointed this\r\nout. These invisible rays work great chemical changes when they get\r\nbeyond violet, and are shown to be heat. So the rays which do not reach\r\nthe velocity of red rays are also heat, which is the effect of motion.\r\n\r\nThus we have HEAT, LIGHT, and SOUND, all\r\nthe ascertained results of vibratory motion. The stillness of the\r\nether around us is known as “Darkness”; the stillness of the air is\r\n“Silence”; the comparative absence of heat, or molecular motion of\r\nbodies is “Cold”!\r\n\r\nIn the first part we showed how coins impart motion to each other.\r\n\r\n  VELOCITY OF LIGHT WAVES.\r\n\r\n  _According to_ SIR J.

This is the case with\r\nsound. The air molecules strike one upon another, and the wave of\r\n“sound” reaches the tympanum, and thus the impression is conveyed to\r\nthe brain. We say we hear—but why we hear, in what manner the movement\r\nof certain particles affects our consciousness, we cannot determine.\r\n\r\nThat the air is absolutely necessary to enable us to hear can readily\r\nbe proved. The experiment has frequently been made; place a bell under\r\nthe receiver of an air-pump, and we can hear it ring. But if we exhaust\r\nthe air the sound will get fainter and fainter. Similarly, as many\r\nof us have experienced upon high mountains, sounds are less marked.\r\nSound diminishes in its intensity, just as heat and light do. Sound is\r\nreflected and refracted, as are light and radiant heat. We have already\r\nshown the effect of reflectors upon heat. Sound is caught and reflected\r\nin the same way as light from mirrors, or as the heat waves in the\r\nreflectors. We have what we term “sounding boards” in pulpits, and\r\nspeaking tubes will carry sound for us without loss of power. Echoes\r\nare merely reflected sounds.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of sound is accepted as 1,100 feet in a second, which\r\nis far inferior to the velocity of light. Fogs will retard sound,\r\nwhile water will carry it. Those who have ever rowed upon a lake will\r\nremember how easily the sound of their voices reached from boat to\r\nboat, and Dr. Hutton says that at Chelsea, on the Thames, he heard\r\na person reading from a distance of a hundred and forty feet. Some\r\nextraordinary instances could be deduced of the enormous distances\r\nsound is said to have travelled. Guns have been heard at eighty miles\r\ndistant, and the noise of a battle between the English and Dutch, in\r\n1672, was heard even in Wales, a distance of two hundred miles from the\r\nscene of action.\r\n\r\nSound always travels with uniform velocity in the air in the same\r\ntemperature. But sound! What is the cause of it? How does it arise?\r\nThese questions can now be fully answered with reference to the\r\nforegoing observations. Phenomena of vibration render themselves\r\nvisible by light, heat, and sound, and to arrive at some definite\r\nideas of sound vibrations we may compare them to waves, such as may be\r\nproduced by throwing a stone into a pond.\r\n\r\nThere are, so to speak, “standing” waves and “progressive” waves. The\r\nformer can be produced (for instance) by thrumming a fiddle-string,\r\nand when the equilibrium of the cord is disturbed, the position of the\r\nequilibrium is passed simultaneously by the string-waves. In water\r\nthe waves or vibrating points pass the position of equilibrium in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nWaves consist of elevations and depressions alternately, and when we\r\nobtain two “systems” of waves by throwing two stones into water, we\r\ncan observe some curious effects. It can be seen how one series of\r\ndepressions will come in contact with the other series of depressions,\r\nand the elevations will likewise unite with the result of longer\r\ndepressions and elevations respectively; or it may very well be that\r\nelevation will meet depression, and then the so-called “interference”\r\nof waves will produce _points of repose_. These points are termed\r\n_nodes_. The waves of the string proceed in the plane of its axis;\r\nwater waves extend in circles which increase in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe progression or propagation of sound may be said to begin when some\r\ntiny globule of matter expands in the air. The air particles strike one\r\nagainst the other, and so the motion is communicated to the air waves,\r\nwhich in time reach the ear. But the velocity of the sound is not equal\r\nin all substances. Air will convey it around our earth at the rate of\r\n765 miles an hour, or 1,090 feet in a second. That is, we may accept\r\nsuch rate as correct at a temperature of 32° Fahr., and at a pressure\r\nof thirty inches, and the velocity increases almost exactly one foot\r\nper second for each degree of temperature above 32°. Therefore on an\r\naverage, and speaking in “round numbers,” the estimate of 1,100 feet in\r\na second may be accepted as correct. In hydrogen gas the rate is much\r\nhigher. Through water again it is different, and still faster through\r\niron, glass, and wood, as will be seen in the following table:—\r\n\r\nTAKING AIR AS 1.\r\n\r\n  Whalebone             6⅔\r\n  Tin                   7½\r\n  Silver                9\r\n  Walnut               10⅔\r\n  Brass                10⅔\r\n  Oak                  10⅔\r\n  Earthen pipes        11\r\n  Copper               12\r\n  Pear-wood            12½\r\n  Ebony                14⅔\r\n  Cherry               15\r\n  Willow               16\r\n  Glass                16⅔\r\n  Iron or Steel        16⅔\r\n  Deal                 18\r\n\r\nSo there is a considerable difference in the velocities of sound\r\nthrough the solid substances quoted, but these figures cannot be taken\r\nas exact, as different samples may give different results. In wires\r\nand bells the bodies themselves produce the sounds we hear. In wind\r\ninstruments and the voice the air is the cause of the sound.\r\n\r\nThe very deepest notes are produced by the fewest vibrations. Fourteen\r\nor fifteen vibrations will give us a very low note, if not the very\r\nlowest. The pipe of sixteen feet, closed at its upper end, will\r\nproduce sound waves of thirty-two feet. High notes can be formed from\r\nvibrations up to 48,000 in a second. Beyond these limits the ear cannot\r\naccept a musical sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.—The vibration of strings.]\r\n\r\nWe will explain the phenomenon of the vibration of strings by means of\r\nthe illustration. In the cut we find a string or wire, which can be\r\nlengthened or shortened at pleasure by a movable bridge, and stretched\r\nby weights attached to the end (fig. 172).\r\n\r\nWe can now easily perceive that the shorter and thinner the string\r\nis, and the tighter it is, the number of vibrations will be greater\r\nand greater. The density of it is also to be considered, and when\r\nthese conditions are in the smallest proportion then the tone will be\r\nhighest. The depth will naturally increase with the thickness, density,\r\nand length, and with a decreasing tension. But we have strings of same\r\nthickness stretched to different degrees of tension, and thus producing\r\ndifferent notes. Some strings are covered with wire to increase their\r\ngravity, and thus to produce low notes.\r\n\r\nWhen a number of separate sounds succeed each other in very rapid\r\ncourse they produce a sound, but to appear as one sound to the ear\r\nthey must amount to fifteen or sixteen vibrations every second. The\r\nparticles of matter in the air form a connected system, and till they\r\nare disturbed they remain in equilibrium; but the moment they are in\r\nany way thrown out of this state they vibrate as the pendulum vibrates.\r\nThe particles thus strike each other, and impart a motion to the\r\nelastic medium air, so a sound comes to us.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of sounds gets less the farther it goes from us, or the\r\nloudness of sound is less the greater its distance. The law is, that\r\nin an unvarying medium the loudness varies inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance. But Poisson has shown that when air-strata, differing\r\nin density, are existing between the ear and the source of the sound,\r\nthe intensity or loudness with which it is heard depends _only_ on the\r\ndensity of the air at the place the sound originated. This fact has\r\nbeen substantiated by balloonists who heard a railway whistle quite\r\ndistinctly when they were nearly 20,000 feet above the ground. It\r\ntherefore follows that sound can be heard in a balloon equally well\r\nas on the earth at certain given distances. But as the density of the\r\nair diminishes the sound becomes fainter, as has been proved by the\r\nbell rung in the receiver of an air-pump. The velocity of sound, to\r\na certain extent, depends upon its intensity, as Earnshaw sought to\r\nprove; for he instanced a fact that in the Arctic regions, where sound\r\ncan be heard for an immense distance, in consequence of the still and\r\nhomogeneous air, the report of a cannon two miles and a half away was\r\nheard before the loud command to “fire,” which must have preceded\r\nthe discharge. Another instance showing the difference in hearing\r\nthrough mixed and homogeneous media may be referred to. In the war\r\nwith America, when the English and their foes were on opposite sides\r\nof a stream, an American was seen to beat his drum, but no sound came\r\nacross. “A coating of soft snow and a thick atmosphere absorbed the\r\nnoise.” Glazed, or hard snow, would have a contrary effect. Reynault\r\nalso experimentally verified his theory, that sound when passing\r\nthrough a space of nearly 8,000 feet lost velocity as its intensity\r\ndiminished, and in that distance between its arrival at 4,000 feet and\r\nat 7,500 feet, the sound velocity diminished by 2·2 feet per second. He\r\nalso tried to demonstrate that sound velocity depended upon its pitch,\r\nand that lower notes travelled with the greater speed.\r\n\r\n_The reflection and refraction of sound_ follows the same fundamental\r\nlaws as the reflection and refraction of light. The reflection of sound\r\nis termed an _Echo_, which is familiar to all tourists in Switzerland\r\nand Ireland particularly. There are several very remarkable echoes in\r\nthe world: at Woodstock, and at the Sicilian cathedral of Gergenti,\r\nwhere the confessions poured forth near the door to priestly ears were\r\nheard by a man concealed behind the high altar at the opposite end.\r\nIt is curious that such a spot should have been accidentally chosen\r\nfor the Confessional. The whispering gallery in St. Paul’s is another\r\ninstance of the echo.\r\n\r\nEchoes are produced by the reflection of sound waves from a plane or\r\neven surface. A wall, or even a cloud, will produce echoes. Thunder\r\nis echoed from the clouds. (The celebrated echo of “Paddy Blake,”\r\nat Killarney, which, when you say “How do you do,” is reported to\r\nreply, “Very well, thank you,” can scarcely be quoted as a scientific\r\nillustration.) And the hills of Killarney contain an echo, and the\r\nbugle sounds are beautifully repeated. In the cases of ordinary echo,\r\nwhen the speaker waits for the answer, he must place himself _opposite_\r\nthe rock. If he stand at the side the echo will reply to another person\r\nin a corresponding place on the farther side, for the voice then\r\nstrikes the rock at an angle, and the angle of reflection is the same,\r\nas in the case of light.\r\n\r\nBut if it should happen that there are a number of reflecting surfaces\r\nthe echo will be repeated over and over again, as at the Lakes of\r\nKillarney. The Woodstock Echo, already referred to, and mentioned\r\nby several writers, repeats seventeen syllables by day, and twenty\r\nby night. In Shipley there is even a greater repetition. Of course\r\nthe echo is fainter, because the waves are weaker if the reflecting\r\nsurface be flat. But, as in the case of the mirrors reflecting light, a\r\ncircular or concave surface will increase the intensity. A watch placed\r\nin one mirror will be heard ticking in the other focus. Whispering\r\ngalleries carry sound by means of the curved surface. Sir John Herschel\r\nmentions an echo in the Menai Suspension Bridge. The blow of a hammer\r\non one of the main piers will produce the sound from each of the\r\ncrossbeams supporting the roadway, and from the opposite pier 576 feet\r\ndistant, as well as many other repetitions.\r\n\r\nRefraction of sound is caused by a wave of sound meeting another medium\r\nof different density, just as a beam of light is refracted from water.\r\nOne sound wave imparts its motion to the new medium, and the new wave\r\ntravels in a different direction. This change is refraction. The sound\r\nwaves are refracted in different directions, according to the velocity\r\nit can acquire in the medium. If a sound pass from water into air it\r\nwill be bent towards the perpendicular, because sound can travel faster\r\nin water than in air. If it pass from air into water its force will\r\ncause it to assume a less perpendicular direction, there being greater\r\nvelocity in water. The velocity in air is only 1,100 feet in a second\r\nin our atmosphere. In water sound travels 4,700 feet in the same time.\r\nWhen the wave of sound falls upon a medium parallel to the refracting\r\nsurface there is, however, no refraction—only a change of velocity, not\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWhen sound waves are prevented from dispersing the voice can be carried\r\na great distance. Speaking tubes and trumpets, as well as ear trumpets,\r\nare examples of this principle, and of the reflection of sound.\r\n\r\nThere are many very interesting experiments in connection with\r\nAcoustics, some of which we will now impart to our readers. We shall\r\nthen find many ingenious inventions to examine,—the Audiphone,\r\nTelephone, Megaphone, and Phonograph, which will occupy a separate\r\nchapter. We now resume.\r\n\r\nAmongst the experiments usually included in the course of professors\r\nand lecturers who have a complete apparatus at their command, and\r\nwhich at first appear very complicated and difficult, there are some\r\nwhich can be performed with every-day articles at hand. There is no\r\nexperiment in acoustics more interesting than that of M. Lissajons,\r\nwhich consists, as is well known to our scientists, of projecting upon\r\na table or other surface, with the aid of oxy-hydrogen light, the\r\nvibratory curves traced by one of the prongs of a tuning-fork. We can\r\nperform without difficulty a very similar experiment with the humble\r\nassistance of the common knitting-needle.\r\n\r\nFix the flexible steel needle firmly in a cork, which will give it\r\nsufficient support; fasten then at the upper extremity a small ball of\r\nsealing wax, or a piece of paper about the size of a large pea. If the\r\ncork in which the needle is fixed be held firmly in one hand, and you\r\ncause the needle to vibrate by striking it, and then letting it sway\r\nof itself, or with a pretty strong blow with a piece of wood, you will\r\nperceive the little pellet of wax or paper describe an ellipse more or\r\nless elongated, or even a circle will be described if the vibrations be\r\nfrequent. The effect is much enhanced if the experiment be performed\r\nbeneath a lamp, so that plenty of light may fall upon the vibrating\r\nneedle. In this case, the persistence of impressions upon the retina\r\nadmits of one seeing the vibrating circle in successive positions, and\r\nwe may almost fancy when the needle is struck with sufficient force,\r\nthat an elongated conical glass, like the old form of champagne glass,\r\nis rising from the cork, as shown in the illustration annexed (fig.\r\n173).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.—Experiment showing vibration of sound waves.]\r\n\r\nAcoustics may be studied in the same way as other branches of physical\r\nscience. We will describe an interesting experiment, which gives a\r\nvery good idea of the transmission of sounds through solid bodies. A\r\nsilver spoon is fastened to a thread, the ends of which are thrust\r\ninto both ears, as shown in fig. 174; we then slightly swing the\r\nspoon until we make it touch the edge of the table; the transmission\r\nof sound is in consequence so intense that we are ready to believe\r\nwe are listening to the double diapason of an organ. This experiment\r\nexplains perfectly the transmission of spoken words by means of the\r\nstring of a telephone, another contrivance which any one may make for\r\nhimself without any trouble whatever. Two round pieces of cardboard are\r\nfitted to two cylinders of tin-plate, as large round as a lamp-glass,\r\nand four-and-a-half inches in length. If the two rounds of cardboard\r\nare connected by a long string of sixteen to eighteen yards, we can\r\ntransmit sounds from one end to the other of this long cord; the\r\nspeaker pronouncing the words into the first cylinder, and the listener\r\nplacing his ear against the other. It is easy to demonstrate that sound\r\ntakes a certain time to pass from one point to another. When one sees\r\nin the distance a carpenter driving in a stake, we find that the sound\r\nproduced by the blow of the hammer against the wood only reaches the\r\near a few seconds after the contact of the two objects. We see the\r\nflash at the firing of a gun, before hearing the sound of the report—of\r\ncourse on the condition that we are at a fairly considerable distance,\r\nas already remarked upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.—Conductibility of sound by solid bodies.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.—Musical glasses.]\r\n\r\nWe can show the production of the Gamut by cutting little pieces of\r\nwood of different sizes, which one throws on to a table; the sounds\r\nproduced vary according to the size of the different pieces. The same\r\neffect may be obtained much better by means of goblets more or less\r\nfilled with water; they are struck with a short rod, and emit a sound\r\nwhich can be modified by pouring in a greater or less quantity of\r\nwater; if the performer is gifted with a musical ear, he can obtain,\r\nby a little arrangement, a perfect Gamut by means of seven glasses\r\nwhich each give a note (fig. 175). A piece of music may be fairly\r\nrendered in this manner, for the musical glasses frequently produce a\r\nvery pure silvery sound. We will complete the elementary principles\r\nof acoustics by describing a very curious apparatus invented by\r\nM. Tisley, the HARMONOGRAPH. This instrument, which we can easily\r\ndescribe, is a most interesting object of study. The Harmonograph\r\nbelongs to mechanics in principle, and to the science of acoustics\r\nin application. We will first examine the apparatus itself. It is\r\ncomposed of two pendulums, A and B (fig. 176), fixed to suspensions.\r\nPendulum B supports a circular plate, P, on which we may place a small\r\nsheet of paper, as shown in the illustration. This paper is fixed by\r\nmeans of small brass clips. Pendulum A supports a horizontal bar, at\r\nthe extremity of which is a glass tube, T, terminating at its lower\r\nextremity with a capillary opening; this tube is filled with aniline\r\nink, and just rests on the sheet of paper; the support and the tube are\r\nbalanced by a counterpoise on the right. The two pendulums, A and B,\r\nare weighted with round pieces of lead, which can be moved at pleasure,\r\nso that various oscillations may be obtained. The ratio between the\r\noscillations of the two pendulums may be exactly regulated by means of\r\npendulum A carrying a small additional weight, the height of which may\r\nbe regulated by means of a screw and a small windlass. If we give to\r\npendulum A a slight movement of oscillation, the point of tube T traces\r\na straight line on the paper placed in P; but if we move pendulum B,\r\nthe paper also is displaced, and the point of tube T will trace curves,\r\nthe shape of which varies with the nature of the movement of pendulum\r\nB, the relation between the oscillations of the two pendulums, etc. If\r\nthe pendulums oscillate without any friction the curve will be clear,\r\nand the point will pass indefinitely over the same track, but when\r\nthe oscillations diminish, the curve also diminishes in size, still\r\npreserving its form, and tending to a point corresponding with the\r\nposition of repose of the two pendulums. The result is therefore that\r\nthe curves traced by the apparatus, of which we produce three specimens\r\n(figs. 177, 178, 179), are traced in a continuous stroke, commencing\r\nwith the part of the greatest amplitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.—M. Tisley’s Harmonograph.]\r\n\r\nBy changing the relation and phases of the oscillations we obtain\r\ncurves of infinitely varied aspect. M. Tisley has a collection of more\r\nthan three thousand curves, which we have had occasion to glance over,\r\nin which we failed to meet with two corresponding figures. The ratio\r\nbetween these curves corresponds with some special class, of which\r\nthe analyst may define the general characters, but which is outside\r\nour present subject. By giving the plate P a rotatory movement, we\r\nobtain spiral curves of a very curious effect, but the apparatus is\r\nmore complicated. Considered from this point of view it constitutes\r\nan interesting mechanical apparatus, showing the combination of\r\noscillations, and resolving certain questions of pure mechanics. From\r\nthe point of view of acoustics it constitutes a less curious object of\r\nstudy. The experiments of M. Lissajons have proved that the vibrations\r\nof diapasons are oscillations similar to, though much more rapid than\r\nthose of the pendulum. We can therefore with this apparatus reproduce\r\nall the experiments of M. Lissajons, with this difference, that the\r\nmovements being slower are easier to study. When the ratio between the\r\n_number of vibrations_—we purposely use the term vibration instead of\r\nthe term oscillation—is a whole number, we obtain figs. 177 and 178. If\r\nthe ratio is not exact, we obtain fig. 179, which is rather irregular\r\nin appearance, corresponding to the distortions noticeable in M.\r\nLissajon’s experiments. Fig. 178 has been traced in the exact ratio\r\n2:3; fig. 177 in the ratio 1:2; and fig. 179 corresponds to the ratio\r\n1:2 and a small fraction, which causes the irregularity of the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.—Ratio 1:2. Fig. 178.—Ratio 2:3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.—Ratio 1:2 and a fraction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. Construction of the Harmonograph. Fig. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.—Method of constructing an Harmonograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.—The apparatus completed.]\r\n\r\nIn considering the harmony of figs. 177 and 178,—the first of which\r\ncorresponds to the octave, the second to the fifth, whilst fig.\r\n179 corresponds to the disagreeable interval of the ninth,—one is\r\nalmost tempted to put a certain faith in the fundamental law of\r\n_simple ratios_ as the basis of harmony. At first sight this appears\r\nbeyond doubt, but perhaps musicians would be hardly content with the\r\nexplanation. M. Tisley’s Harmonograph, it will be seen, is a rather\r\ncomplicated apparatus; and I will now explain how it may be constructed\r\nby means of a few pieces of wood. I endeavoured to construct as simple\r\nan apparatus as possible, and with the commonest materials, feeling\r\nthat it is the best means of showing how it is possible for everybody\r\nto reproduce these charming curves of musical intervals. Also I\r\ncompletely excluded the employment of metals, and I constructed my\r\napparatus entirely with pieces of wooden rulers, and old cigar boxes.\r\nI set to work in the following manner: on the two consecutive sides\r\nof a drawing board I fixed four small pieces of wood (fig. 180), side\r\nby side in twos, having at the end a small piece of tin-plate forming\r\na groove (fig. 181). In these grooves nails are placed which support\r\nthe pendulums. The piece of wood is placed on the corner of the table,\r\nso that the pendulums which oscillate in two planes at right angles,\r\nare in two planes that are sensibly parallel to the sides of the table.\r\nThe pendulums are made of a thin lath, with two small pieces of wood\r\nfixed to them containing some very pointed nails, on which the pendulum\r\noscillates. Fig. 182 gives an illustration. The pendulums have a pin\r\nfixed in vertically, which passes through a piece of wood, and by\r\nmeans of a hinge connects the upper ends of the two pendulums. This\r\ncontrivance of the pin is very useful, and if care is taken to make the\r\nhole through the hinge in the form of a double cone, as shown in fig.\r\n182, _c_, it makes a perfect joint, which allows the piece of wood to\r\nbe freely moved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.—Details of mechanism.]\r\n\r\nTo complete the apparatus, the heads of the two pendulums are united by\r\nthe hinge, at the bend of which a slender glass tube is fixed, which\r\ntraces the curves. The hinge is given in fig. 184, and to its two\r\nextremities are adjusted the two pins of the pendulum (fig. 183). The\r\npendulums are encircled with round pieces of lead, which can be fixed\r\nat any height by means of a screw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nACOUSTICS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n THE TOPOPHONE—THE MEGAPHONE—THE AUTOPHONE—THE AUDIPHONE—THE\r\n TELEPHONE—THE PHONOGRAPH—THE MICROPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe propose in this chapter to give as shortly as possible a description\r\nof the various instruments lately come into use, by means of which,\r\nand electricity, sounds can be carried from place to place, and their\r\nlocality identified. It is only within the last few years that these\r\nwonderful inventions have come into use, and in a measure superseded\r\nthe at one time invincible electric telegraph. The Telephone is now\r\nin daily use in London and other places, and its novelty, if not\r\nall its capability, has been discounted. The Phonograph has also\r\nbeen frequently seen. So we will on this occasion commence with the\r\nTOPOPHONE, a rather novel instrument.\r\n\r\nAs the name indicates, the TOPOPHONE is an apparatus for\r\ndiscovering the position of a sound, from the Greek words signifying\r\na “place” and “sound.” The _sources_ of sound can be found by it, and\r\nindeed this is its actual and practical use. It is claimed for this\r\nnew apparatus that it stands in the same relation to the sailor as his\r\nold and trusty friends, the compass and sextant. These in navigation\r\ninform the steersman as to his course, and tells him his position by\r\nobservation. The Topophone will tell him whence a sound arises, its\r\norigin wherever it may be; and this in a fog is no mean advantage.\r\nSuppose a ship to be approaching a dangerous coast in a fog. We are all\r\naware how deceptive sounds are when heard through such a medium. We\r\ncannot tell from what precise direction the horn, whistle, or bell is\r\nsounding. The Topophone will give us the exact spot, and we can then,\r\nfrom our general knowledge of the locality, work our vessel up the\r\nriver, or into the harbour, in safety.\r\n\r\nThe Topophone was invented in 1880, by Professor Alfred Mayer, an\r\nAmerican, and is based upon the well-known theory of sound waves.\r\nThese, as we have already explained, exist in the air; and if the\r\ntheory of sound waves has perfected the Topophone, we can fairly say\r\nthat it has confirmed the supposed form of the sound waves. “Sound,”\r\nsays the inventor of the apparatus, “is supposed to be a particle\r\ncontinually expanding in the air, composed of a wave produced by\r\ncompression, and followed by rarefaction. A continuous sound is a\r\nseries of these particles or globules spreading and expanding as the\r\nwater-rings in a pond.” This much will be at once perceived.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose a person up to his shoulders in a pond of water, and\r\nsomeone throws a stone into it. If that person extend his arms and\r\nhands at right angles facing the sound, each hand would touch the edge\r\nof a ripple as it came towards him across the pond. He would then be\r\nfacing the source of the ripples or waves, and look along a radius\r\nof the circle formed by the waves. But if he please, he can move his\r\nbody so that both hands shall touch the same wave at the same time,\r\nor he might turn away from the source, and only one hand would touch\r\nthe wave. But when both hands are actually washed by the same circular\r\nripple he must be facing the source of it. Any position in which his\r\nfingers did not touch the ripple almost at the same instant, would not\r\nbe facing the source of the wave ripples. So by turning and extending\r\nhis hands, he could with his eyes shut find out whether he was or was\r\nnot facing the original source of the waves.\r\n\r\nThis applied to sound waves in the air is the whole theory of the\r\nTopophone, which, however, depends for its usefulness upon the same\r\nnote being sounded by all horns and whistles. One note must be better\r\nthan all the others, and that note, probably C (treble), caused by\r\nabout two hundred and sixty vibrations per second, has been found most\r\napplicable. If all whistles and horns can by law be compelled to adjust\r\nthemselves to this note, then the Topophone will be a real and lasting\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the apparatus itself.\r\n\r\nIt being conceded that the resonators are in the same key as the\r\nFoghorn,—and this is necessary,—they are placed upon the deck of the\r\nvessel. An ear-tube of indiarubber is carried from each of these\r\n“resonators” into the cabin. These tubes unite and again separate,\r\nending in small pieces ready to be fitted to the ears. The apparatus\r\nis fixed on deck, and the arrangement which supports it passes into\r\nthe cabin, and can be turned about in any direction. Of course in this\r\ncase a dial point is necessary to indicate the direction in which the\r\ninstrument is turned. If the machine be worn on the shoulders of the\r\nofficer of the watch he can move as he pleases, and wants no indicator.\r\n\r\nThe Topophone when used is so constructed, that when a horn is heard,\r\nand when the listener is facing the sound, he can _hear nothing_! When\r\nnot facing the origin of the sound he can hear the horn very well, but\r\nthe moment the resonators receive the sound together as they face the\r\nsource, a very low murmur is heard, or perhaps no sound at all.—Why?\r\n\r\nA certain pitch of tone is composed of vibrations or waves of equal\r\nlength. In all waves there is a hollow and a crest. One neutralizes\r\nthe other. The hollow of a sound wave meeting the crest of another\r\nwave “interferes” to produce silence, stillness, a dead level. So in\r\n“light”; two rays will produce darkness. We will endeavour to explain\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIf we have two equal strings, each performing an equal number of\r\nvibrations in a second, they will produce equal sound waves, and the\r\nsound produced by both together will be uninterrupted, and twice as\r\nloud as one of them. But if one string vibrate, say one hundred times,\r\nand the other one hundred and one times in a second, they will _not_\r\nbe in unison, and one will gain upon the other string, till after it\r\nhas got to fifty vibrations it will be half a vibration ahead. At that\r\nmoment they will neutralize each other, and silence will ensue for an\r\nappreciable time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.—The Megaphone.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of light suppose a _red_ ray strikes the eye, and another\r\nred ray to come upon it from somewhere else. If the difference between\r\nits distance and the other point from the spot in the retina on which\r\nthe first ray fell, is the 258/1000 part of an inch, or exactly twice,\r\nthrice, four times as much, etc., that distance, the light will be seen\r\ntwice as strong. But if the difference in the distances between the\r\npoints whence the light comes be only _one-half the 258/1000 part of an\r\ninch_, or 1½, 2½, 3½, or 4½ times that distance, one light\r\nwill extinguish the other, and darkness will be the result. Now this\r\nis precisely what happens in the case of the Topophone. To return to\r\nour simile of water waves. If two stones be cast into a pond, and two\r\nequal and similar waves produced, and if they reach a certain place at\r\nthe same moment, they will make one large wave. But if one followed\r\nthe other a little, so that the hollow of one coincided with the crest\r\nof the other, and _vice versâ_, the waves would obliterate each other,\r\nand a dead level would result. One tube of the Topophone is half a wave\r\nlength longer than the other, and when the resonators are in a line and\r\nreceive the wave at the same time, one ear hears the elevation of the\r\nsound wave, and the other the depression,—the sound is neutralized, and\r\ncomparative, if not actual, silence results. The sailor knows in what\r\ndirection the land lies, and can calculate his distance, or anchor if\r\nhe please.\r\n\r\nIf amongst our readers there be any who wish to make for themselves an\r\nacoustic signalling apparatus there is physically nothing to prevent\r\nthem from constructing such an instrument as that shown in the annexed\r\nwoodcut (fig. 185). It is founded upon the speaking-trumpet principle,\r\nwhich is supposed to have been originated by Samuel Markland, in 1670.\r\n\r\nKircher, in his “_Ars magna et umbra_,” and in his “_Phonurgia_,”\r\nmentions a kind of speaking-trumpet, or _porte voix_, of gigantic\r\ndimensions, and called the “Horn of Alexander.” According to Kircher,\r\nthe instrument was used by Alexander the Great to summon his soldiers\r\nfrom a distance of ten miles. The diameter of the circumference was\r\nabout eight feet, and Kircher conjectured that the instrument was\r\nmounted upon three supports.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century, a German professor, named Huth, made a model\r\nof the horn, and found it answered every purpose of a speaking-trumpet\r\nwith most powerful results, but we beg leave to doubt whether the\r\ninstrument really carried the voice to any very great distance.\r\n\r\nThe Acoustic Cornet, which is the counterpart of the speaking-trumpet,\r\nhas been made in many different forms during the last two centuries,\r\nbut none of them to the present time consist of anything more intricate\r\nthan a simple tube with a mouthpiece and bell-shaped orifice.\r\n\r\nProfessor Edison, however, in his researches regarding the conveyance\r\nof sounds, has made numerous and interesting experiments. On one\r\noccasion, with his Megaphone he carried on a conversation at a distance\r\nof nearly two miles, without any other assistance from instruments\r\nexcept a few little cornets of cardboard. These constitute the\r\nMegaphone, which may be regarded as a curiosity, considering the\r\neffects produced by such simple means. The illustration (fig. 185)\r\nrepresents the instrument which is (or was lately) fixed upon the\r\nbalcony of Mr. Edison’s house. At a mile-and-a-half distant from the\r\nhouse, at a spot indicated by the two birds in the picture, another\r\ninstrument was fixed, and conversation was carried on with ease.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the present opportunity will be the most convenient to speak of\r\nthe AUTOPHONE, although it is more a musical than an acoustic\r\ninstrument. Until lately Barbary organs and piano organs have been the\r\nonly means by which poor people have been able to hear any music, and\r\nthat not of a very elevated class. Besides, there is a good deal of\r\nexpense connected with the possession of an organ. But the Americans,\r\nwith a view to popularize music, have invented the AUTOPHONE,\r\nwhich is simply a mechanical accordeon, manufactured by the Autophone\r\nCompany, of Ithaca, New York.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the instrument is represented in fig. 186, and is\r\nextremely simple. An upright frame carries within it on one side a\r\nbellows, and on the other a flexible air chamber, which serves as a\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion contains a set of stops like an accordeon, but the\r\nescape of the air through the small vibrating plates can only take\r\nplace by the upper surface of the frame work, upon which slides a thin\r\nplate of Bristol board pierced with holes at convenient distances, and\r\nset in motion by the mechanism shown in the annexed diagram (fig. 187).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.—The Autophone.]\r\n\r\nThe figure represents an axle furnished with a series of “washers,”\r\nwhich, acting upon the plate, cause it to move round. It is the bellows\r\nmovement that turns the axle by the aid of two “catches,” B\r\nand C, which work upon a toothed wheel fixed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe “catch” B moves the paper on which the tune is\r\n“perforated,” when the bellows is empty, the other catch when it is\r\ndistended; but a counter catch, D, represented by the dotted\r\nlines in the illustration, is so arranged that the paper cannot pass\r\non except the tooth of the catch D is opposite a hole pierced\r\nupon the plate above. In the contrary case there is no movement of\r\nthe paper during the dilatation of the bellows. The effect of this\r\nvery ingenious arrangement is to give to the “musical” band of “board”\r\nan irregular movement, but it economises it in the case of sustained\r\nnotes. The whole action of the instrument depends upon the correct\r\nworking of the bellows.\r\n\r\nThe effect, from an artistic point of view, certainly leaves something\r\nto be desired, but the instrument is cheap, and not cumbersome, and\r\nthe slips of paper upon which the music is “cut out” can be made by\r\nmachinery, and consequently are not dear. So far, the Autophone is\r\nfitted for popular favour and use, and may supersede the barrel organ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.—Detail of the Autophone.]\r\n\r\nThe AUDIPHONE is an instrument to conduct sound to the ear,\r\nto supplement it when temporary or partial deafness has occurred. Very\r\nlikely many of our readers have observed ladies carrying large black\r\nfans on occasions,—at church, or lecture, or theatre,—and wondered\r\nwhy, perhaps. Those “fans” are Audiphones. The instrument is made of\r\nvulcanized rubber, and consists of a long flexible disc supported by\r\na handle. To the upper edge of the “fan” are attached cords, which\r\npass through a clip on the handle. If the person who wishes to hear by\r\nmeans of the Audiphone will hold the fan against the upper teeth,—the\r\nconvex side of the fan outward,—he or she will hear distinctly, for\r\nthe vibrations of sound are collected and strike upon the teeth and\r\nbones, and act upon the auditory nerves from within, precisely as the\r\nvibrations act from without through the auricle. We need hardly add\r\nthat if the ear be injured the Audiphone will be of no use. A writer\r\nsays: “From personal observation with the Audiphone it appears to\r\nconvey the sonorous vibrations to the ear through the teeth, just as\r\na long wooden rod held in the teeth will convey the vibrations of the\r\nsounding-board of a piano, though the piano is in another room and out\r\nof hearing by the ear. In using the Audiphone during conversation there\r\nis no movement or vibration felt by the teeth; in listening to a piano\r\nthere is a very faint sensation as if the Audiphone vibrated slightly,\r\nwhile with the handle of the Audiphone resting on the sounding-board\r\nof the piano the vibrations are so violent as to be painful to the\r\nteeth. By closing the ears a person with even acute hearing can observe\r\nthe admirable manner in which the instrument conveys spoken words to\r\nthe ear. The Audiphone will prove to be of great value to deaf mutes,\r\nas it enables them to hear their own voices, and thus to train them\r\nto express words, while, before, they could only make inarticulate\r\nsounds.”\r\n\r\nWe have a variation of this instrument which has been introduced\r\nemploying a diaphragm held in a telephone mouthpiece, and free to\r\nvibrate under the influence of sounds. This is connected by a string\r\nto a bit of wood that may be held in the teeth. In use the hearer\r\nplaces the wood between his teeth, the string is drawn tight, and the\r\nspeaker speaks through the telephone mouthpiece, the vibrations of\r\nthe diaphragm being then conveyed to the teeth through the stretched\r\nstring. This apparatus works very successfully, and ladies use it, but\r\nit is not so convenient for general use as the Audiphone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.—The Telephone.]\r\n\r\nThe Telephone is now in daily use in London, and is by no means\r\nstrange to the majority of our countrymen, still some description of\r\nit will probably be acceptable, and a glance at its history may prove\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.—The “receiving” apparatus.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Telephone, we must not lose sight of the facts\r\nbefore mentioned, as regards our sense of hearing, and the manner in\r\nwhich the ear acts by the series of bones termed the hammer, the anvil,\r\nand stirrup. In the process of reproduction of tone in the magnetic\r\ninstruments, the mechanism of the human ear was, to a certain extent,\r\nimitated, and a diaphragm, by vibrations, generates and controls an\r\nelectric current.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wheatstone was the first person to employ the electric\r\nwire for the transmission of sounds, but Professor Philip Reiss, of\r\nFriedrichsdorf, was the first to make the experiment of producing\r\nmusical sounds at a distance. His first instrument was of a most\r\nprimitive nature; subsequently he produced an instrument of which fig.\r\n188 is the Telephone, fig. 189 the “receiver.”\r\n\r\nIn fig. 188, it will be seen that there is an aperture on the top and\r\none at the side; the latter is the mouthpiece. The top aperture is\r\ncovered with a membrane which is stretched very tightly. When a person\r\nspeaks or sings into the mouthpiece his voice is at once concentrated\r\nupon the tight membrane, which it causes to vibrate in a manner\r\ncorresponding with the vibrations of the voice. There are two binding\r\nscrews, one at each side. To the centre of the tight membrane a piece\r\nof platinum is fixed, and this is connected with the binding screw on\r\none side, in which a wire from the battery is fixed. On the membrane\r\nis a tripod, the feet of which (two) rest in metal cups, one of them\r\nbeing in a mercury cup connected with the binding screw at the opposite\r\nside to that already mentioned. The third “foot”—a platinum point—is on\r\nthe platinum in the centre of the membrane or top, and moves with it.\r\nEvery time the membrane is stretched by a vibration the platinum point\r\nis touched, and the closed circuit is broken by the return of each\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.—Bell’s first Telephone (Transmitter).\r\n\r\n_a._ Electro-magnet. _b._ Diaphragm. _c._ Collar. _d._ Collar and tube.\r\n_f._ Screw. _g._ Mouthpiece. _h._ Battery. _i._ Wire from battery to\r\ncoil. _k._ Telegraph wire. _l._ Through binding screw. _m._ Pillar\r\nholding magnet.]\r\n\r\nThe receiving instrument (fig. 189) consists of a coil enclosing an\r\niron rod, and fixed upon a hollow sounding box. It is founded upon a\r\nfact discovered by Professor Henry, that iron bars when magnetized by\r\nan electric current become a little longer, and at the interruption\r\nof the current resume their former length. Thus in the receiver the\r\niron will become alternately longer and shorter in accordance with the\r\nvibrations of the membrane in the box far away, and so the longitudinal\r\nvibrations of the bar of iron will be communicated to the sounding box,\r\nand become perfectly audible. This instrument, however, could only\r\nproduce the “pitch” of sound, “not different degrees of intensity, or\r\nother qualities of tones.” It merely sang with its own little trumpet\r\nwhatever was sung into it; for all the waves were produced by an\r\nelectric current of a certain and uniform strength, and therefore the\r\nsound waves were of the same size.\r\n\r\nBut in 1874, Mr. Elisha Gray, of Chicago, improved Reiss’ instrument,\r\nand discovered a method by which the intensity or loudness of tones, as\r\nwell as their “pitch,” were transmitted and reproduced. In this method\r\nhe employed electrical vibrations of varying strength and rapidity,\r\nand so was enabled to reproduce a tune. Subsequently he conceived the\r\nnotion of controlling the vibrations by means of a diaphragm, which\r\nresponded to every known sound, and by this he managed to transmit\r\nspeech in an articulate manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.—Bell’s Telephone (Receiver).]\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Professor Graham Bell sent a Telephone to the Centennial\r\nExhibition at Philadelphia. Mr. Bell, according to the report, managed\r\nto produce a variation of strength of current in exact proportion to\r\nthe particle of air moved by the sound. A piece of iron attached to\r\na membrane, and moved to and fro in proximity to an electro magnet,\r\nproved successful. The battery and wire of the electro magnet are in\r\ncircuit with the telegraph wire, and the wire of another electro magnet\r\nat the receiving station. This second magnet has a solid bar of iron\r\nfor core, which is connected at one end, by a thick disc of iron, to\r\nan iron tube surrounding the coil and bar. The free circular end of\r\nthe tube constitutes one pole of the electro magnet, and the adjacent\r\nfree end of the bar core the other. A thin circular iron disc held\r\npressed against the end of the tube by the electro-magnetic attraction,\r\nand free to vibrate through a very small space without touching the\r\ncentral pole, constitutes the sounder by which the electric effect is\r\nreconverted into sound. The accompanying illustrations (figs. 190, 191)\r\nshow Mr. Bell’s Telephone as described.\r\n\r\nThe Telephone, subsequently simplified by Professor Bell, is shown in\r\nthe two following illustrations (figs. 192, 193). The voice strikes\r\nagainst the diaphragm, and it begins to vibrate. The _sound_ is not\r\nconveyed by the wire; the _motion_ is communicated, and the vibrations\r\nbecome sound waves again. The Telephone consists of a cylindrical\r\nmagnet encircled at one end by a bobbin, on which is wound a quantity\r\nof fine insulated copper wire. The magnet and coil are contained in a\r\nwooden case, the ends of the coil being soldered to thick copper wire,\r\nwhich traverse the “wooden envelope,” and terminate in the binding\r\nscrews. In front of the magnet is a thin circular iron plate, in which\r\nis the mouthpiece. The drawings will explain the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.—External appearance of Bell Telephone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.—_a._ Bobbin of coil wire round magnet. _b._\r\nDiaphragm. _c._ Mouthpiece. _d._ Permanent magnet. _e._ Wires to\r\nbinding screws. _f._ Both wires as one for convenience. _g._ Adjusting\r\nscrew-holding magnet.]\r\n\r\nMr. Edison also invented a Telephone like Gray’s, and made the\r\ndiscovery, that when properly prepared, carbon would change its\r\nresistance with pressure, and that the ratio of these changes\r\ncorresponded with the pressure. This solved the problem of the\r\nproduction of speech. The carbon is placed between two plates of\r\nplatinum connected in the circuit and near the diaphragm, and the\r\ncarbon receives the pressure from it by means of the mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to MAGNETISM and ELECTRICITY we may have\r\nsomething more to say respecting the mysteries of the Telephone and\r\nits later developments. At present we are only concerned with it as a\r\nsound conveyer, and it answers its purpose admirably, although somewhat\r\nliable to attract other sounds or vibrations from neighbouring wires.\r\n\r\nThe PHONOGRAPH, a mechanical invention of Mr. Edison, does not\r\nmake use of electricity, although the vibratory motion of the diaphragm\r\nis utilized. It, in a simple form, consists of a diaphragm so arranged\r\nas to operate upon a small stylus, placed just opposite and below the\r\ncentre, and a brass cylinder, six or eight inches long, by three or\r\nfour in diameter, mounted upon a horizontal axis, extending each way\r\nbeyond its ends for a distance about its own length.\r\n\r\n“A spiral groove is cut in the circumference of the cylinder, from one\r\nend to the other, each spiral of the groove being separated from its\r\nneighbour by about one-tenth of an inch. The shaft or axis is also cut\r\nby a screw thread corresponding to the spiral groove of the cylinder,\r\nand works in screw bearings; consequently when the cylinder is caused\r\nto revolve, by means of a crank that is fitted to the axis for this\r\npurpose, it receives a forward or backward movement of about one-tenth\r\nof an inch for every turn of the same, the direction, of course,\r\ndepending upon the way the crank is turned. The diaphragm is firmly\r\nsupported by an upright casting capable of adjustment, and so arranged\r\nthat it may be removed altogether when necessary. When in use, however,\r\nit is clamped in a fixed position above or in front of the cylinder,\r\nthus bringing the stylus always opposite the groove as the cylinder is\r\nturned. A small, flat spring attached to the casting extends underneath\r\nthe diaphragm as far as its centre and carries the stylus, and between\r\nthe diaphragm and spring a small piece of india-rubber is placed\r\nto modify the action, it having been found that better results are\r\nobtained by this means than when the stylus is rigidly attached to the\r\ndiaphragm itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.—Mode of using the Telephone.]\r\n\r\n“The action of the apparatus will now be readily understood from what\r\nfollows. The cylinder is first very smoothly covered with tin-foil, and\r\nthe diaphragm securely fastened in place by clamping its support to the\r\nbase of the instrument. When this has been properly done, the stylus\r\nshould lightly press against that part of the foil over the groove.\r\nThe crank is now turned, while, at the same time, someone speaks into\r\nthe mouthpiece of the instrument, which will cause the diaphragm to\r\nvibrate, and as the vibrations of the latter correspond with the\r\nmovements of the air producing them, the soft and yielding foil will\r\nbecome marked along the line of the groove by a series of indentations\r\nof different depths, varying with the amplitude of the vibrations of\r\nthe diaphragm; or in other words, with the inflections or modulations\r\nof the speaker’s voice. These inflections may therefore be looked upon\r\nas a sort of visible speech, which, in fact, they really are. If now\r\nthe diaphragm is removed, by loosening the clamp, and the cylinder\r\nthen turned back to the starting point, we have only to replace the\r\ndiaphragm and turn in the same direction as at first, to hear repeated\r\nall that has been spoken into the mouthpiece of the apparatus; the\r\nstylus, by this means, being caused to traverse its former path, and\r\nconsequently, rising and falling with the depressions in the foil,\r\nits motion is communicated to the diaphragm, and thence through the\r\nintervening air to the ear, where the sensation of sound is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.—BELL’S LONG-DISTANCE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\n  _a._ Compound magnet.   _d._ Diaphragm.    _e._ Speaking tube.\r\n  _f._ Telegraph wire.   _g._ Line to earth.    _b_, _c._ Small spaces.]\r\n\r\n“As the faithful reproduction of a sound is in reality nothing more\r\nthan a reproduction of similar acoustic vibrations in a given time, it\r\nat once becomes evident that the cylinder should be made to revolve\r\nwith absolute uniformity at all times, otherwise a difference more\r\nor less marked between the original sound and the reproduction will\r\nbecome manifest. To secure this uniformity of motion, and produce a\r\npractically working machine for automatically recording speeches,\r\nvocal and instrumental music, and perfectly reproducing the same, the\r\ninventor devised an apparatus in which a plate replaces the cylinder.\r\nThis plate, which is ten inches in diameter, has a volute spiral groove\r\ncut in its surface on both sides from its centre to within one inch of\r\nits outer edge; an arm guided by the spiral upon the under side of the\r\nplate carries a diaphragm and mouthpiece at its extreme end. If the\r\narm be placed near the centre of the plate and the latter rotated, the\r\nmotion will cause the arm to follow the spiral outward to the edge. A\r\nspring and train of wheel-work regulated by a friction governor serves\r\nto give uniform motion to the plate. The sheet upon which the record is\r\nmade is of tin-foil. This is fastened to a paper frame, made by cutting\r\na nine-inch disc from a square piece of paper of the same dimensions\r\nas the plate. Four pins upon the plate pass through corresponding\r\neyelet-holes punched in the four corners of the paper, when the latter\r\nis laid upon it, and thus secure accurate registration, while a\r\nclamping-frame hinged to the plate fastens the foil and its paper frame\r\nsecurely to the latter. The mechanism is so arranged that the plate may\r\nbe started and stopped instantly, or its motion reversed at will, thus\r\ngiving the greatest convenience to both speaker and copyist.\r\n\r\n“The articulation and quality of the Phonograph, although not yet\r\nperfect, is full as good as the Telephone was. The instrument, when\r\nperfected and moved by clock-work, will undoubtedly reproduce every\r\ncondition of the human voice, including the whole world of expression\r\nin speech and song, and will be used universally.\r\n\r\n“The sheet of tin-foil or other plastic material receiving the\r\nimpressions of sound, will be stereotyped or electrotyped so as to be\r\nmultiplied and made durable; or the cylinder will be made of a material\r\nplastic when used, and hardening afterward. Thin sheets of _papier\r\nmaché_, or of various substances which soften by heat, would be of this\r\ncharacter. Having provided thus for the durability of the Phonograph\r\nplate, it will be very easy to make it separable from the cylinder\r\nproducing it, and attachable to a corresponding cylinder anywhere and\r\nat any time. There will doubtless be a standard of diameter and pitch\r\nof screw for Phonograph cylinders. Friends at a distance will then send\r\nto each other Phonograph letters, which will talk at any time in the\r\nfriend’s voice when put upon the instrument.” (_Scribner._)\r\n\r\nThe MICROPHONE (an outcome of the Telephone) was discovered\r\nby Professor Hughes, of London. It is an instrument which in its main\r\nfeatures consists of a carbon “pencil,” so suspended that one end rests\r\nupon a carbon “die.” The instrument being connected with a Telephone\r\nby the circuit wires, will reproduce faint sounds very distinctly.\r\nOnce a Microphone was put into a preacher’s pulpit, and joined to a\r\nprivate telegraph wire which led to a gentleman’s house. The owner was\r\nthus enabled to hear the sermon. So long as it is thus connected every\r\nminute sound, even a fly’s footstep, will be faithfully reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n THE TUNING-FORK—THE SYREN—SOUND FIGURES—SINGING FLAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot close the subject of Sound without some mention of the\r\nMusical Pitch, and various instruments and experiments which have from\r\ntime to time been made to discover the pitch, sound, and vibrations,\r\nand even to _see_ Sound. To understand the vibrations or “pitch”\r\nof a musical note we may study the illustration, which shows us a\r\ntuning-fork in vibration.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive that each prong of the tuning-fork beats the air\r\nin an opposite direction at the same time, say from _a_ to _b_ (fig.\r\n196). The prong strikes the air, and the wave thus created strikes\r\nagain outward, and the condensation thus created travels along the\r\nback beat, rarefying the air, and both these, the rarefaction and the\r\ncondensation, move with the same rapidity one behind the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.]\r\n\r\nThe tuning-fork of course vibrates a very great many times in a second,\r\nevery vibration generating a wave. “Pitch,” in a general sense, is the\r\nnumber of vibrations per second which constitute a note. For instance,\r\nthe note A, the standard pitch consists of four hundred and thirty-five\r\ncomplete vibrations per second. Concert pitch is slightly higher,\r\nfor there are a few more vibrations in the second. The lowest sound\r\npitch is forty vibrations, the highest forty thousand. “Pitch” may be\r\ndetermined by an instrument termed the “Syren,” or by a tooth-wheeled\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe SYREN was invented by Cagniard de Latour. It consists of\r\na metal cylinder, a tube passes through the bottom, and through the\r\ntube air is blown into the cylinder. On the top a number of holes are\r\ndrilled, while just over the cylinder top, almost in contact with it,\r\nis a metallic disc, which rotates upon a vertical axis. The disc is\r\nperforated with holes equal in number to those in the cylinder top, but\r\nthe holes are not perpendicular, they slope in opposite directions. So\r\nwhen the air is forced through the holes in the top of the cylinder it\r\nimpinges upon one side of the holes in the rotating disc, and blows it\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe disc in one revolution will therefore open and shut as many holes\r\nas there are in the disc and cylinder, and the air blown in will escape\r\nin so many puffs—the number of puffs in a given time depending upon the\r\nrapidity of rotation. There is an arrangement to show the number of\r\nturns. By these rotations a sound is produced which rises in pitch as\r\nthe revolutions are increased in number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 198.      Sound Figures.      Fig. 199.]\r\n\r\nTo determine the pitch of a certain sound we must find the number of\r\ntimes the plate revolves in that time, then we shall have the number\r\nof vibrations per second required to produce the note we desire.\r\nThe arrangement working in a notched wheel tells us the number of\r\nrotations of the disc. Successive, and rapidly-successive puffs or\r\nbeats are heard as the rotation increases, and at length the two\r\nsounds will disappear, and merge into one, which is perhaps that of\r\nthe tuning-fork, whose note you require to find the “pitch” of. By\r\nmaintaining this rate for a minute or less, and setting the gear to\r\ntell the revolutions, the number will be found marked on the dial of\r\nthe apparatus. So by multiplying the number of revolutions of the disc\r\nby the number of the holes, and dividing the product by the number of\r\nseconds during which the disc was in connection with the recording\r\ngear, we shall have the number of vibrations per second necessary to\r\nproduce the pitch corresponding to the given sound. The above is the\r\ndescription of one form of Syren; there are others, which, however, we\r\nneed not detail.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there are certain _nodal points_, or resting-places,\r\nin vibrations, and this can easily be shown upon a fiddle-string, from\r\nwhich paper discs will fall off except on the nodal point, showing\r\nthat there is no vibration there. The same experiment may be made by\r\nmeans of plates, which will give us what are termed Chladni’s figures.\r\nSuppose we strew a glass-plate with fine sand, and stroke the edge with\r\na fiddle-bow. The vibrations of the plates will make certain patterns,\r\nand cast the sand upon those points of repose to form nodal lines in\r\nvarious directions. The plates must, of course, be held or fastened,\r\nand a variety of _sound figures_ may be produced. (_See_ figs. 198 and\r\n199.)\r\n\r\nThe relation between the number of segments on the plate and the pitch\r\nof the note, can be ascertained by using a circular plate clamped\r\nin the centre. “If the finger on the plate and the fiddle-bow are\r\none-eighth of the circumference apart, the fundamental note will be\r\nproduced. If one-sixteenth apart, the higher octave will be heard.”\r\n\r\nSensitive flames will detect air vibrations, and flames can also be\r\nmade to sing. Sensitive flames were discovered by Mr. Barrett, who\r\nnoticed the effect a shrill note had upon a gas flame from a tapering\r\njet. The flame was a very long one (fourteen inches), and when the\r\nsound was produced it shortened at once, while the upper part expanded\r\nlike a fan; the same effects, in a less marked degree, were observable\r\nwhen the shrill sound was prolonged from a distance of forty feet.\r\nProfessor Tyndall was immediately interested in this discovery, and in\r\nJanuary 1867 he lectured upon it at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nIf any one wish to try the experiment, a piece of glass tubing should\r\nbe obtained, and let the mouth be tapered down to a small orifice\r\none-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. Then when the highest pressure\r\nis on for the evening, light the gas and sound a shrill whistle. The\r\nflame will sink down and spread out. The illuminating power may thus be\r\nincreased, and many experiments may be made. For instance, if a person\r\nbe in the room and try to read, he will probably not be able to do so\r\nat a little distance; but if his friend whistle to the gas it will so\r\nexpand itself as to enable him to read, so long as the whistle lasts.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious burglar-detector was made upon the principle of the\r\nsensitive flame, which expands at a noise and heats a welded plate of\r\ngold, silver, and platinum. The plate swerves aside, the metals being\r\nunequally affected by heat, and as it is connected with a battery,\r\nrings a bell by electricity. A small high flame has been made sensitive\r\nto the chinking of coin, or even to the ticking of a watch. We will now\r\ngive some explanation, derived partly from Professor Tyndall, of the\r\ncause of sensitive flames.\r\n\r\nA sensitive flame is one just on the point of “roaring,” and about\r\nto change its aspect. “It stands,” says Tyndall, “on the edge of\r\na precipice. The proper sound pushes it over.... We bring it to\r\nthe verge of falling, and the sonorous pulses precipitate what was\r\nalready imminent.” The flame is in a state of vibration, so sounds\r\nbeing vibrations, practically increase the pressure; and the flame\r\nacknowledges the pressure thus invisibly applied by air waves.\r\n\r\nSINGING FLAMES are produced by burning hydrogen in a tube;\r\na musical note is thus produced in the same way as the air causes a\r\nnote in an organ pipe. Faraday attributed the sound to rapid vibration\r\ncaused by successive explosions of the burning gas. The Gas Harmonicon\r\nhas been made on this principle. The air, being heated in the glass\r\ntube, ascends, and the flame is thus permitted to come up more forcibly\r\nin the tube; so violent agitation results when the air tries to get\r\ninto the opening above. The size of the flame and its position in the\r\ntube will give a certain note which will be the same note as the air\r\nwould emit if in a pipe, for the vibrations give the sound.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Wheatstone has shown by experiment how sound can be\r\ntransmitted by placing a rod on a musical-box, and carrying the rod\r\nthrough the ceiling. When a guitar or violin was placed upon the rod,\r\nthe sounds of the musical-box were distinctly heard in the upper room.\r\nA _Phantom Band_ can be made by connecting certain instruments with\r\nothers being played on under the stage. Every one will then appear to\r\nplay by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n DERIVATION OF ELECTRICITY—SEALING-WAX EXPERIMENT—THE\r\n ELECTROPHORUS—LEYDEN JAR—POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE—THE\r\n ELECTROSCOPE—ELECTRIC MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now briefly and of course imperfectly reviewed the phenomena of\r\nVibration, as exemplified in what we term Heat, Light, and Sound. We\r\nnow come to a most mysterious servant of mankind, as mysterious as any\r\nDjinn of romance; viz., ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nThe term Electricity is derived from the Greek word _electron_,\r\nmeaning “amber”; because from amber the properties of what we call\r\n“Electricity” were first discovered. Six hundred years before the\r\nChristian Era, Thales wrote concerning the attraction which amber,\r\nwhen rubbed, possessed for light and dry bodies. But it is to an\r\nEnglishman named Gilbert that we owe the word “Electricity,” which he\r\nderived from the Greek, and in his works (about 1600 A.D.)\r\nhe discusses the force of the so-called “fluid.” Otto von Guerike, of\r\n“air-pump” celebrity, and many other philosophers after him, continued\r\nthe investigation of the subject. At the beginning of the last century\r\ngreat attention was paid to the Electric Machine. The Leyden Jar was,\r\nas its name denotes, discovered by Muschenbrock, of Leyden, (though\r\nthe honour was disputed). Franklin made the first lightning conductor\r\nin 1760. Volta and Galvani, to whose invention we owe “Voltaic\r\nElectricity” and “Galvanism,” and Faraday in more modern times gave a\r\ngreat impetus to electrical science. The great part that electricity\r\nhas been playing in the domestic history of the world since Faraday’s\r\nlamented death, is probably known to the youngest of our readers. What\r\nthe future of this agent may be we can only guess, but even now we may\r\nregard electricity as only in its infancy.\r\n\r\nThere are few scientific studies more attractive to the general reader\r\nthan electricity, and few admit of more popular demonstration. The\r\nsuccess of the late electrical exhibition in Paris, and its successor\r\nin London at the present time, are proofs of the interest taken in this\r\ngreat and mysterious agent whose origin we are in ignorance of, and of\r\nwhose nature and powers we are daily discovering more and more, and\r\nfinding there is still an immense field for its application.\r\n\r\nSome fundamental facts regarding electricity may very easily be studied\r\nwith the assistance of every-day objects at hand. Amber was the first\r\nsubstance to show attraction when rubbed, but Gilbert found out that\r\nglass and sealing-wax, etc., possessed like properties with amber.\r\n\r\nIf we rub a stick of sealing-wax with a piece of cloth, we shall see\r\nthat it will attract some small fragments of paper placed near it.\r\nNothing is easier than to construct a small pendulum to show with\r\nperfect clearness the phenomenon of electric attraction. A piece of\r\niron is fixed on a wooden pedestal, and supports a thread of silk, to\r\nthe end of which is fastened a little ball cut out of a piece of cork.\r\nThe stick of sealing-wax after being rubbed with the cloth will attract\r\nthe ball as shown in fig. 200.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.—Sealing-wax attracting a piece of cork.]\r\n\r\nBy means of a piece of paper we can produce a spark. I take a large,\r\nstrong sheet of drawing paper, heat it very thoroughly, and lay it on\r\na wooden table. I rub it with a perfectly dry hand, or with a piece\r\nof woollen material until it adheres to the table. That done, I place\r\na bunch of keys in the centre of the sheet of paper, which I raise,\r\nlifting it by two corners. If at this moment any one touches the bunch\r\nof keys with his finger, a bright spark will be elicited. The metal is\r\ncharged with the electricity developed on the paper; if the weather\r\nis dry, and the paper thoroughly heated several times, the spark may\r\nattain nearly an inch in length.\r\n\r\nWe can easily construct other electrical apparatus. For instance, an\r\n“Electrophorus,” or instrument for obtaining electricity by means of\r\ninduction, or a Leyden jar, can both be made at home. Let us proceed to\r\nconstruct the former, of which we give an illustration (fig. 201).\r\n\r\nWe take a lacquered tea-tray about a foot long, and cut out a sheet of\r\nthick wrapping paper, so that it will lie over all the level portion\r\nof the tray. At each side of this sheet of paper we fix two bands of\r\npaper, as in the illustration (fig. 201), so as to serve as handles.\r\nThe tea-tray should be placed upon two tumblers to support it and\r\nto insulate it, glass being a “non-conductor.” (We will speak of\r\nconductors and non-conductors presently.) We have now our Electrophorus\r\nmade ready for action; let us proceed to see how it will act.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201—Simple Electrophorus.]\r\n\r\nFirst, rub the thick packing paper over a hot fire or a stove, and the\r\nfriction must be continued for some time, until the paper has become\r\nthoroughly dry, and as hot as possible without charring. When this has\r\nbeen accomplished, place it quickly upon a wooden table, and rub it\r\nrapidly and energetically with a clothes’ brush, dry and hard as can\r\nbe obtained. Place the paper upon the tray; touch the tray with the\r\nknuckle, and draw away the paper by the handles fixed to it (_see_\r\nfig. 201); a spark will result. Then if the paper be replaced upon the\r\ntray, and the hand again presented, the same result will follow. This\r\nexperiment may be repeated five or six times, at least, with success.\r\n\r\nWe have in this tea-tray and its paper covering a real electric\r\nmachine. How can we manage to provide a Leyden jar to contain our\r\nelectricity? Nothing is more easy. Let us take a tumbler and partly\r\nfill it with shot; insert into the glass a tea-spoon, and if all the\r\narticles are quite dry we shall possess a Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nTo charge the jar we have thus provided we must work the Electrophorus\r\nwe have already described. While one person lifts off the paper as\r\ndirected, another must hold the glass filled with shot close to the\r\nedge of the tray, and touch the corner with the tea-spoon; the spark\r\nwill then enter the “jar” or tumbler. We can thus charge the jar as we\r\nplease, and by presenting the finger as in the illustration (fig. 202),\r\nwe shall obtain a discharge from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.—A Leyden jar.]\r\n\r\nMr. Louis Figuier, in his “_Merveilles de la Science_,” relates that\r\nWollaston, meeting one of his friends one evening in the streets of\r\nLondon, drew from his pocket a copper thimble, and proceeded to turn it\r\ninto a microscopic pile.[13]\r\n\r\nIn order to do this he removed the bottom of the thimble, flattened\r\nit with a stone, so as to bring the two internal surfaces about on a\r\nline with each other, then placed between the copper surfaces a small\r\nstrip of zinc, which was not in contact with the copper, owing to the\r\ninterposition of a little sealing-wax. He then placed it in a glass\r\ncup, previously filled with the contents of a small phial of water,\r\nacidulated with sulphuric acid. He next wound round the strip of zinc\r\nand its copper covering a piece of platinum wire, the wire becoming\r\nred through the electricity developed in the pile. The dimensions of\r\nthis platinum wire were extremely small; it was only 30/1000 of an inch\r\nin diameter, and 1/30 of an inch in length. By reason of its small\r\ndimensions it could not only be reddened, but fused by the little\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nThus Wollaston’s friend, who was a witness of the experiment, was\r\nable to light a tinder at the red wire. In this little battery of\r\nWollaston’s the copper enveloped the strip of zinc in every part;\r\nthat is to say, the negative element was on a higher surface than the\r\npositive metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.-A simple compass.]\r\n\r\nAfter considering Electricity, it is not impossible to approach the\r\nstudy of Magnetism, and even to construct a mariner’s compass. We\r\nshall find the method of doing so by borrowing an interesting passage\r\nfrom the “_Magasin Pittoresque_.” Let us take a small cork and pass\r\nthrough it an ordinary knitting-needle (fig. 203), which we have\r\nalready magnetized by placing it N.S., rubbing it gently, and always in\r\nthe same direction, with one of those little iron magnets with which\r\nchildren amuse themselves. After the needle has been passed through\r\nthe cork, we also fix into it a sewing-needle, or rather a pin, the\r\npoint of which rests in one of the little holes in the upper part of\r\nthe thimble. In order to balance the magnetised needle, we thrust a\r\nmatch into both sides of the cork, as shown in the illustration, and\r\nfasten to the ends of each a ball of wax. Thus the needle, the balls,\r\nand the pin are all balanced at once, so that the contrivance has the\r\nappearance of the illustration.\r\n\r\nAs it is very important that with such a sensitive instrument any\r\nagitation of the air should be avoided, the thimble must be placed at\r\nthe bottom of a common earthen pan, B D T, which should be\r\ncovered over with a piece of glass, V. To graduate the compass\r\na circle is described on a piece of paper. On this dial we trace the\r\ndivisions sufficiently close only at the north extremity of the needle,\r\nand the paper is fixed underneath, as in fig. 203. Then we fix a piece\r\nof wax at the end of the match pointing N., opposite the\r\nnorthern extremity of the needle inside the basin. In this way we have\r\na very useful and inexpensive compass.\r\n\r\nWe may also magnetize a fine sewing-needle, and grease it by rubbing\r\nit with a little suet. It is then capable of floating on the surface\r\nof water running in the direction of the north pole. We might go on\r\nmultiplying indefinitely examples of physical experiments without\r\napparatus, but we have probably already given a sufficient number to\r\naid our readers in imagining others.\r\n\r\nWe have now in a simple manner shown how we can easily produce\r\nelectricity. We may understand that electrical phenomena are\r\nproduced—(1) friction between different bodies; (2) by placing bodies\r\nwhich differ in contact; (3) by the transition of bodies from one\r\ncondition to another; (4) by chemical changes; (5) by animals. The two\r\nfirst, and the fourth, are the most usual causes.\r\n\r\nWe know that certain substances when rubbed with silk or wool acquire\r\nthe property of attracting other substances. But in the case of a\r\nrod of glass or stick of wax, the attraction will only be perceived\r\nwhen the rubbing has been applied. But metal will behave differently.\r\nAny part of the metal rod will continue to attract. So metals are\r\nCONDUCTORS of electricity; while glass, wax, silk, amber,\r\nsulphur, etc., are _bad_, or NON-CONDUCTORS. Metals are the\r\nbest conductors we have, but trees, plants, liquids, and the bodies of\r\nanimals, including men, are all good conductors of electricity. Dry air\r\nis a bad conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.—Attraction and repulsion.]\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of electricity, known as positive and negative\r\n(_plus_ or _minus_), vitreous or resinous. We saw in fig. 200 that we\r\ncan attract a small ball of pith or cork by a piece of sealing-wax\r\nrubbed with flannel. If we then present a glass rod rubbed with silk\r\nto it, it will be equally attracted, but will be at once repelled; and\r\nafter being so repelled, if we put the wax to it, it will be attracted\r\nto the sealing-wax again. So wax at first attracts then repels the\r\nball, and so does glass, but either will attract the ball if presented\r\nalternately (fig. 204). The reason for this is as follows:—\r\n\r\nWhen we have rubbed the glass with silk, we charge it with positive\r\nelectricity, and when the rod touches the ball, the latter imbibes that\r\nelectricity, and flies away from the glass rod. The sealing-wax imparts\r\nnegative electricity in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe law is, that bodies charged with the same kind of electricity\r\n_repel_ each other, and those containing the opposite kinds _attract_\r\neach other. Positive _repels_ positive; negative _repels_ negative.\r\nBut positive _attracts_ negative, and negative _attracts_ positive.\r\nOpposite electricities unite, and so neutralize each other that no\r\neffect is perceived; but it must be borne in mind that all bodies\r\npossess both electricities in some quantity, greater or less. By\r\nrubbing we separate these electricities, the rubber becoming negative,\r\nthe rub_bee_ positive. The friction of glass supplies positive\r\nelectricity, and sealing-wax supplies negative electricity, or we can\r\nobtain the same effect by rubbing either with certain material.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which a body is electrified depends upon its nature\r\nand condition; but we may accept as a general axiom,—but by no means\r\nas a law,—that when two bodies are rubbed together, that which gets\r\nthe hotter in the process takes the negative kind of electricity. In\r\nthe following list the substances have been so arranged that each is\r\nnegatively electrified by those preceding, and positively by those\r\nsucceeding it. 1, cat’s skin; 2, glass; 3, woollen stuffs; 4, feathers;\r\n5, wood; 6, paper; 7, silk; 8, shellac; 9, rough glass. We append a\r\nlist of conducting and non-conducting bodies in their order:—\r\n\r\nCONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\n  Metals.\r\n  Lime, coal, or coke.\r\n  Saline mixtures.\r\n  Pure water.\r\n  Vegetable tissues.\r\n  Animal tissues.\r\n  Hot air.\r\n  Steam.\r\n  Rarefied air.\r\n\r\nNON-CONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\n  Ice.\r\n  India-rubber.\r\n  Marble.\r\n  Porcelain.\r\n  Resin.\r\n  Dry gases.\r\n  Paper.\r\n  Wool.\r\n  Silk.\r\n  Shell-lac.\r\n  Diamond.\r\n  Glass.\r\n  Wax.\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.—Positive and negative.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.—The Battery.]\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the degree of value as a conductor or\r\nnon-conductor depends somewhat upon the atmosphere. For instance, glass\r\nis an excellent insulator, or non-conductor, when dry, but when wet\r\nit changes to a conductor. So insulators are at times covered with a\r\nsolution of shell-lac, or fat, to keep away moisture. We may reasonably\r\nconclude that bodies which are good and bad conductors are good and\r\nbad conductors of electricity. Water is a good conductor, air is a\r\nbad one; were it otherwise, electricity would escape from the ground\r\ninto the air; as it is, the air manages in some degree to retain the\r\nelectricity at the surface of bodies, for it is on the surface that we\r\nfind the electric “fluid.”\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned _electrical induction_ in a former experiment with\r\nthe tea-tray. We will now explain it more fully, as a consideration\r\nof it will bring us to the _electric spark_, or lightning, with the\r\naccount of the discovery of the _Conductor_ and the _Electrical\r\nMachine_.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the illustration next below. A B is a cylinder supported\r\non a glass rod, and at each extremity is a small pith ball, _a_ and\r\n_b_. The cylinder is in a neutral condition, as is evidenced at first\r\nby the pellets being in a vertical position. But suppose we bring a\r\nball, C, towards the cylinder. C is charged with positive electricity,\r\nwhich attracts the negative to itself, and so repels the positive away\r\nat the opposite side. So the pellet at one side will be attracted to C,\r\nand the other will fly in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.—Electrical induction.]\r\n\r\nLet us take another illustration. Here we have a horizontal metal rod,\r\n_cc′_, insulated on a glass stand. Two balls of cork are attached\r\nat both ends of the rod by metallic wires. Hold a rod of resin, _r_,\r\nwhich has been made negatively electrical, and apply it to one pair of\r\nthe cork balls. The positive electricity will be attracted at _c′_ and\r\nthe negative repulsed, and fly away at _c_. If we remove the resin the\r\nequilibrium will be again established, and the balls will fall to a\r\nvertical position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.—Induction.]\r\n\r\nWe can also by drawing off the negative electricity by the finger at\r\n_c_, while the resin rod is still held to the other side, _c′_, fill\r\nthe whole of the metal rod with the positive electricity when the\r\nfinger and the resin have been removed respectively first and last. The\r\nballs will then fly in opposite directions again, in consequence of the\r\nrepulsion exercised by the positive poles.\r\n\r\nThe “Electrophore,” or “_Electrophorus_,” we have already learned\r\nto make for ourselves, as also the Leyden Jar. But we give cuts of\r\nthem. The former is very simple, and can be made by mixing two parts\r\nof shell-lac and one of turpentine, and pouring the mixture upon a\r\nmetal plate. If this be rubbed with a cat’s skin when dry, and a metal\r\ncover with a glass handle be placed upon it, it will be found that the\r\npositive and negative electricity are collected on the lower and upper\r\nsurfaces of the plate respectively, and can be drawn away with a spark\r\nas before, and made use of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.—Electrophorus.]\r\n\r\nThe Leyden Jar requires a little more detailed description, as it is\r\nto it we are indebted for our Battery. It is a common glass bottle or\r\njar, coated both inside and out with tinfoil nearly as high as the\r\nshoulder, _a_ _a_. The mouth should be firmly closed with a bung of\r\nwood, _g_ _g_; a hole should be bored in the bung, through which a\r\nbrass rod is tightly pushed. The rod, too, is topped by a brass knob,\r\nand a brass chain is attached to the other extremity. The interior of\r\nthe tinfoil receives positive electricity, and the exterior negative\r\nwhen the jar is charged from the “Electrophorus.” To discharge the jar\r\nand create a _shock_ it is necessary to put one hand on the outside,\r\nand the other on the knob of the jar. A brilliant spark and a severe\r\nshock will result if the jar has been fully charged. It is as well to\r\nbe cautious when trying this experiment. The effect of the shock may be\r\nfelt by any number of persons joining hands, if one at one end of the\r\nrow, and one at the other end, touch the knob and the outside of the\r\njar simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.—The Leyden Jar.]\r\n\r\nThis electric discharge is lightning in miniature, and it is to\r\nBenjamin Franklin that the world is indebted for the discovery. The\r\nphilosopher was greatly interested in the science of Electricity and,\r\nhaving retired from business, he devoted himself to the consideration\r\nof thunderstorms. He wrote a treatise to show that points drew off\r\nelectricity, and that electricity and lightning were similar. He urged\r\nthat metallic rods might be attached to ships and buildings, so that\r\nduring thunderstorms, or at other times, the electricity might be\r\nharmlessly carried into the ground. This suggestion he made without\r\nbeing able to explain _why_ points did carry off electricity without\r\na spark. The reason is because there is no place to store it; it runs\r\naway at once, without having time to collect, as in a ball.\r\n\r\nFranklin made one or two experiments before his renowned kite-flying\r\narrangement, which convinced him that electricity was by no means\r\nan agent to be played with. He endeavoured to kill a turkey by\r\nelectricity, but by incautious handling of the jars in which the\r\n“fluid” was stored, he discharged them, and describes the result: “The\r\nflash was very great, and the crack was as loud as a pistol; yet my\r\nsenses being instantly gone, I neither saw the one nor heard the other,\r\nnor did I feel the stroke on my hand, though I afterwards found it\r\nraised a round swelling where the fire entered as big as half a pistol\r\nbullet.” On a subsequent occasion he was again struck senseless while\r\nendeavouring to administer a shock to a paralytic patient.\r\n\r\nIt was not until June 1752 that Franklin made the experiment with\r\nthe kite, which resulted in such great discoveries. He made his kite\r\nof a silk pocket-handkerchief, and he fixed a pointed rod upon the\r\nupright portion of the frame at the top; the string ended in a foot\r\nor so of silk, which was held by the philosopher, and to the end of\r\nthe hempen portion of the string a large key was tied. For some time,\r\nnotwithstanding the approach of most unmistakable thunder-clouds, his\r\npatience was tried. But at last the strands of the hempen string began\r\nto bristle up, and soon after, when Franklin applied his knuckle to\r\nthe key, a spark was obtained. The great discovery was made. Franklin\r\nsubsequently obtained lightning in his own house, and performed several\r\nexperiments with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.—The Electroscope.]\r\n\r\nThe Electroscope (fig. 211) is an instrument by which we can ascertain\r\nwhether electricity is present or not, and the nature of it. If we\r\nbring an object unelectrified close to the ball or knob on the top of\r\nthe glass shade, the two needles, or strips of gold-leaf, which are\r\noften used, will remain still. But if the body has been electrified\r\nit will communicate the electricity to the rod inside, and attract to\r\nitself the fluid of opposite quality; the same kind of electricity then\r\nis in action in the gold-leaf or needles, and they fly apart—repel each\r\nother. Supposing that positive electricity were first communicated, we\r\ncan cause the contraction of the leaves or wires by applying a negative\r\nkind, which, meeting the positive, neutralizes it, and the wires\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nIf the electricity with which the instrument is charged be positive, by\r\napproaching the baton to the ball, A, we shall see the wires\r\ndiverge more than before, and they will finally be discharged by the\r\nknobs within. If the electricity be contrary to that in the baton, the\r\nwires will approach each other, but by gradually withdrawing the baton\r\nthey will again separate, and even to a greater distance than before.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Machine is shown in the illustration (fig. 212). It\r\nconsists of a large plate of glass fixed upon a glass stand, between\r\nwooden supports. The handle is of glass; two pairs of rubbers are\r\nfastened above and below; the plate is turned between them, and becomes\r\n“positively” electrified. The rubbers are covered with leather and\r\nstuffed with horsehair, DD, and press very tightly against the\r\nglass, so that the friction is constant. The rubbers are covered with\r\nan amalgam made of mercury, zinc, and tin, two parts of the first to\r\none each of the others. A chain (of metal) connects the machine with\r\nthe ground. The conductors, PP, are united by a cross-piece,\r\nQ, and sustained upon glass supports. At the end of the\r\nconductors are two curved rods, CC, which are provided with\r\npoints to take the electricity from the plate, but do not touch it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.—The Electric Machine.]\r\n\r\nThe electricity is thus stored in the insulated conductors as the\r\nmachine is turned. The negative portion is carried into the ground by\r\nthe chain from the rubbers, while the positive electricity is retained.\r\nThe longer we turn the more we shall obtain, and the quantity is\r\nmeasured by an electric pendulum on one of the conductors, which flies\r\nout by degrees as the charge increases, and indicates its power by\r\nmeans of a needle it works upon an ivory index.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to make an electric machine out of a glass bottle.\r\nThis will furnish the glass cylinder. If a stick be run through it (for\r\nwhich purpose a hole must be drilled in the bottom of the bottle), a\r\nhandle can be fixed, and the bottle mounted on a stand. A wash-leather\r\ncushion, stuffed, can be so arranged that it will press against the\r\nbottle as it is turned; a piece of silk should be permitted to hang\r\nfrom the cushion frame over the glass. A conductor may be made from a\r\npiece of wood neatly rounded and smoothed, and coated with tinfoil.\r\nThe ends should be rounded like “knobs.” Stick pins in to collect the\r\nelectricity (and it will be readily obtained). The cushion should of\r\ncourse be well smeared with amalgam. From this, as well as from the\r\nglass-plate machine, the “positive” electricity can be drawn off and\r\nstored in a Leyden jar, and then discharged by the “discharging rod,”\r\nwhich is represented on the cut. It may have one or two handles, and\r\none knob is placed outside the jar, the other near the ball surmounting\r\nit. The glass being a non-conductor saves the operator, and some long\r\nsparks and loud reports may be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.—Cylinder machine.]\r\n\r\nThe Electric Machine is always assumed to give off _positive_\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nSir William Armstrong’s Electric Machine is a mode of obtaining\r\nelectricity by moist steam. The design is Armstrong’s, and Professor\r\nFaraday subsequently went into all the conditions to produce the\r\n“fluid” by the friction of steam. The machine was something like a\r\nsmall boiler supported on glass legs. A row of nozzles was fixed upon\r\nthe escape pipe so as to create a great velocity and friction in\r\nthe escaping steam. Round the nozzles was a box of cold water, for\r\nthat fluid was found necessary for the production of electricity as\r\ndemonstrated by Professor Faraday. The steam rushed against a row of\r\npoints attached to the prime conductor of an electric machine, and the\r\nelectricity of the steam was thus given off to the conductor. There are\r\nmany other forms of electric machines, but it will serve no purpose to\r\ndetail them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.—Discharging rod.]\r\n\r\nThe _Electric Battery_ (_see_ fig. 206) is formed by a collection of\r\nLeyden jars. The inside and outside coatings are connected in a box\r\ndivided into partitions lined with tinfoil. The rods of the jars are\r\nalso connected, as in the illustration, by brass rods, and when this\r\nbattery is charged people should be careful how they handle it, for a\r\nshock may be produced which would cause serious injury, if not death.\r\nThe battery can be charged from the machine by a chain fastened to the\r\ncentral ball, while a second chain connects the exterior of the box and\r\nall the outside of the jars, by means of the handle, to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen electricity is at rest it is termed “static electricity,” and\r\nwhen in motion “dynamic” electricity. The latter treats of electric\r\ncurrents which can be sent through wires or chains. We can keep this\r\ncurrent moving by means of a machine, and the battery called a Voltaic\r\nbattery, from Volta. We will describe it presently. Electric currents\r\ncan be measured, for they may be of different strengths according\r\nto the battery, and they are measured by the GALVANOMETER.\r\nElectricity can therefore be transferred and carried by the conducting\r\nsubstances, and much heat will be engendered as the “electric fluid”\r\npasses along a wire. Lightning frequently fuses bell-wires as it\r\npasses, and when we touch upon Galvanism or Dynamical Electricity we\r\nshall hear more about it.\r\n\r\nBy the Electric Machine we can obtain some very powerful currents\r\nof electricity; we can produce many pleasing effects, and perform a\r\nnumber of experiments, such as making balls or figures of pith dance,\r\nand several other easy and entertaining tricks, which will be found in\r\nbooks more specially devoted to the entertainment of young people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.—Leyden Jar.]\r\n\r\nWe have now given some explanation of the manner in which electrical\r\nphenomena can be produced,—viz., by the Electric Machine and by the\r\nLeyden Jar,—but we must not expect to find any electricity inside any\r\ncharged body. It has been proved that all the electricity is upon\r\nthe surface of bodies, even if in varying quantity, and that equal\r\nquantities of electricity are always produced when bodies are excited\r\nby friction, but the _kinds_ are different. The rubbing body is of one\r\nkind, the body rubbed another, and consequently the forces neutralize\r\neach other. The two forces or kinds of electricity we have seen repel\r\nor attract each other, and we can imagine the farther they are apart\r\nthe less will be the force, and the _rate of diminution of force_,\r\naccording to distance, is ascertained by an ingenious apparatus called\r\na “Torsion” Electromoter, which was constructed by Coulomb, and was\r\nfrequently used by Faraday.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people may not be aware of the term “torsion.” It means\r\ntwisting, and “the torsion of a thread suspended vertically is the\r\nforce tending to twist the lower extremity when the upper end is turned\r\nthrough an angle.” This instrument is really an Electromoter, and is\r\nnot considered suited to beginners, and it is scarcely accurate in its\r\nworkings. We need not therefore describe it in detail. There are some\r\nexcellent Electromoters, the Elliott being, we believe, the best for\r\nuse. A full and detailed description of the Quadrant Electromoter will\r\nbe found in Mr. Gordon’s treatise on Electricity.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation of foregoing Chapter._ So far, we have seen there is\r\nelectricity in everything, although some bodies are termed conductors\r\nand others non-conductors; though, as in applying the terms heat and\r\ncold, we must remember that no body is entirely devoid of electricity,\r\nand no body is therefore an absolute _non_-conductor any more than any\r\nobject is absolutely devoid of heat. Faraday, indeed, was of opinion\r\nthat “conduction and insulation are only extreme degrees of one common\r\ncondition”; they are identical both in principle and action, except\r\nthat in _conduction_ an effect common to both is raised to the highest\r\ndegree, and in the case of insulation it occurs in an almost insensible\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nWe have also read of positive and negative electricities, and we must\r\nnot fancy there is any particular reason for this distinction. It was\r\nDu Fay, whom we have mentioned, who gave the names “vitreous” and\r\n“resinous” to the two kinds, as one was developed by rubbing glass, and\r\nthe other by rubbing resin. But, as shown by our experiments, either\r\nkind of electricity can be excited in glass or sealing-wax, and both\r\nkinds are produced at once. You cannot get “positive” without negative\r\nelectricity. “Positive” is the term applied to the kind produced by\r\nrubbing glass with silk or wool; “negative” is the term applied to\r\nthe kind developed by rubbing sealing-wax, but the kind developed by\r\nfriction depends on the rubbing substance and certain conditions.\r\n\r\nBodies charged with the same electricity repel; if charged with\r\ndifferent kinds they attract each other. The more readily displaced\r\nparticles when bodies are rubbed become negatively electrified as a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nSimilar electricities repel each other with a force inversely\r\nproportional to the squares of the distance between their centres,\r\nas established by Coulomb. So if the space between any two similarly\r\nelectrified bodies be reduced by say _one-half_, the force of the\r\nrepulsion will be increased _four_ times. The rule for attraction is\r\nsimilar; so when two bodies are charged with opposite electricities,\r\nand the distance between them is increased, the attractive force is\r\ndiminished in proportion as the square of the distance between them.\r\nMany confirmations of this theory were made by the late friend of\r\nour boyhood, Sir W. Snow Harris, and published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_.\r\n\r\nThe following full list of conductors and non-conductors (copied from\r\nProfessor Noad’s Text-book of Electricity, and compared with De La\r\nRive’s Treatise) may be useful:—\r\n\r\n  CONDUCTING BODIES IN ORDER OF\r\n  CONDUCTING POWER.\r\n\r\n  All the metals.\r\n  Well-burnt charcoal.\r\n  Plumbago.\r\n  Concentrated acids.\r\n  Powdered charcoal.\r\n  Dilute acids.\r\n  Saline solutions.\r\n\r\n  INSULATORS IN THE INVERSE ORDER OF\r\n  INSULATING POWER.\r\n\r\n  Dry metallic oxides.\r\n  Oils (heavier the better).\r\n  Vegetable ashes.\r\n  Transparent dry crystals.\r\n  Ice below 13° Fahr.\r\n  Phosphorus.\r\n  Lime.\r\n\r\n  CONDUCTING BODIES IN ORDER OF\r\n  CONDUCTING POWER.\r\n\r\n  Metallic ores.\r\n  Animal fluids.\r\n  Sea-water.\r\n  Spring-water.\r\n  Rain-water.\r\n  Ice above 13° Fahr.\r\n  Snow.\r\n  Living vegetables.\r\n  Living animals.\r\n  Flame smoke.\r\n  Steam.\r\n  Salts soluble in water.\r\n  Rarefied air.\r\n  Vapour of alcohol.\r\n  Vapour of ether.\r\n  Moist earth and stones.\r\n  Powdered glass.\r\n  Flowers of sulphur.\r\n\r\n  INSULATORS IN THE INVERSE ORDER OF\r\n  INSULATING POWER.\r\n\r\n  Dry chalk.\r\n  Native carbonate of baryta.\r\n  Lycopodium.\r\n  Caoutchouc.\r\n  Camphor.\r\n  Silicious and argillaceous stones.\r\n  Dry marble.\r\n  Porcelain.\r\n  Dry vegetables.\r\n  Baked wood.\r\n  Leather.\r\n  Parchment.\r\n  Dry paper.\r\n  Hair.\r\n  Wool.\r\n  Dyed silk.\r\n  Bleached silk.\r\n  Raw silk.\r\n\r\nThe following may be added to the Insulators, viz.:—\r\n\r\n  Transparent precious stones.\r\n  Diamond.\r\n  Mica.\r\n  All vitrefactions.\r\n  Glass.\r\n  Jet.\r\n  Wax.\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n  Resins.\r\n  Amber.\r\n  Gutta-percha.\r\n  Shell-lac (or gum-lac).\r\n  Ebonite.\r\n\r\nThere are, as we know, two kinds of electricity, the _static_ and\r\n_dynamic_; and when the latter state is _instantaneous_, it is\r\nreferred to as the “electric discharge,” which occurs when opposite\r\nelectricities seek each other, and the bodies return to a state of\r\nequilibrium or neutralization. “These bodies, if _insulated_, obtain no\r\nmore electricity after the spark has passed; but if there be a constant\r\nsource of negative electricity supplying one, and a constant source of\r\nnegative electricity supplying the other, there will be a succession of\r\nsparks; and if they communicate by a conductor there will be, through\r\nthis conductor, an uninterrupted neutralization of a continual reunion\r\nof the two electricities, and this is what is termed the continuous\r\ndynamic state or electric current” (De la Rive).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] This interesting experiment, which we have exactly verified, was\r\ndescribed to us by Professor Waldner, and M. A. Keppler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n VELOCITY OF ELECTRICITY—EXPERIMENTS—THE ELECTRIC EGG—FORCE OF THE\r\n ELECTRIC SPARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now acquainted with many facts concerning electricity, and have\r\nseen that electrical phenomena can be produced by the Electric Machine\r\nand the Leyden Jar. (An insulating stool—a stool with glass legs—is\r\na very desirable adjunct for those who wish to experiment with the\r\nmachine). Glass is a great insulator, or non-conductor, as a Russian\r\nphilosopher found to his cost. He had an iron lightning-conductor from\r\nhis house into his room, the end not connected with the earth but with\r\na glass. One day the lightning came down the rod and reached the glass;\r\nhad a communication been made with the earth by a chain, or directly,\r\nno mischief would have ensued. As it happened, however, the current was\r\nchecked by the glass, and immediately darted towards him; it struck\r\nhim in the head, and killed the poor man on the spot. If no insulating\r\nstool were used, the body charged would be discharged upon contact with\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of electricity is very great, and experiments have\r\nfrequently been made. Wheatstone undertook to ascertain the speed\r\nof the electric fluid, and the instrument he employed he called a\r\n“Chronoscope.” He caused a mirror to revolve with enormous velocity,\r\nand measured the speed by the vibrations of air, which produced a\r\ncertain note by the same motive power. (We know already that certain\r\nnotes are produced by a certain number of vibrations per second.)\r\nWheatstone’s Chronoscope consisted of this mirror, in front of which\r\nwas placed a circular block of wood, in which, in a row, were set six\r\nwires carrying small knobs; round these and over the wood he put an\r\ninsulating varnish. A Leyden jar was connected outside with the first\r\nknob; between the second and third a quarter of a mile of copper wire\r\nwas coiled, and a like length of wire between the fourth and fifth; the\r\ninside of the Leyden jar was then connected with the last knob, and the\r\nspark passed; it ran from knob to knob over the long coils of wire. If\r\nall the flashes over the wire and knobs occurred simultaneously the\r\nmirror would show them side by side; if not, as the mirror turned a\r\ntrifle, the difference would be observed. The mirror did show a slight\r\nretardation in the passage of the flash, and from certain measurements\r\nand calculations Wheatstone estimated the velocity of the spark to be\r\n288,000 miles a second. This rate will carry electricity round the\r\nearth in about a twelfth of a second, a rate Puck never dreamed of when\r\nhe promised to “put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.”\r\n\r\nBut it appeared from investigations subsequently made that it was not\r\npossible to express the velocity of electricity with any certainty,\r\nand a number of experiments were made as per the following table, with\r\nvery different results. Sir William Thomson and Faraday endeavoured\r\nto account for these stupendous discrepancies, and the principles of\r\nretardation of electricity were established. The differences are shown\r\nbelow:—\r\n\r\n                                   Nature of  Velocity per\r\n                                    Wire.

The brightest portion of a spark has been\r\nascertained to last only forty-six millionths of a second, and certain\r\nexperiments were made to ascertain the actual duration with various\r\nnumbers of Leyden jars. It was discovered by Messrs. Lucas and Cuzin,\r\nby an application of the Vernier, with batteries consisting variously\r\nof two to eight jars, and obtained the following results[14]—\r\n\r\n                         Duration in\r\n  No. of Jars.     millionths of a Second.\r\n      2                      26\r\n      4                      41\r\n      6                      45\r\n      8                      47\r\n\r\n“So,” adds the writer, “the duration (of spark) increases in proportion\r\nwith the number of the jars. It increases also with the striking\r\ndistance, but is independent of the diameter of the balls or globes\r\nbetween which the spark strikes.”\r\n\r\nMany examples might be given of the _spark discharge_ of the electric\r\ncurrent. This form is seen in the blue line extending between the knob\r\nof a machine and the hand, and the duration of a spark with a jar\r\ncharged with an induction coil is stated by Professor Rood to vary, but\r\nthe brightest portion with a jar of 114 square inches only existed for\r\nthe 175th _billionth_ of a second, and with a smaller surface was much\r\nshorter. Such a spark may be conducted to a plate of gunpowder and will\r\nnot ignite it, because the time of the duration of the “fire” is not\r\nsufficiently long; the powder will be scattered, but not ignited. If,\r\nhowever, a partly non-conducting medium be interposed between the jar\r\nand the powder, so that the spark be retarded a little, the gunpowder\r\nwill be fired.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of electric discharge we may remark upon the beautiful\r\neffect of lightning. These discharges are sometimes miles long, and by\r\nthe return stroke from the cloud may kill a person a long way from the\r\nactual discharge. This phenomenon was illustrated by Viscount Mahon in\r\n1779, in a very interesting book on the principles of electricity.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways in which the electric discharge shows itself.\r\nWe have spoken about the spark discharge which, however, is found to\r\npresent very different appearances in varying conditions. Professor\r\nFaraday proved that the colour of the electric sparks showed in air,\r\nwhen obtained with brass balls, the intense light and blue colour so\r\nfamiliar to all. In nitrogen they are even bluer. In oxygen again the\r\nsparks are much _brighter_ than in air, but not so _brilliant_. In\r\nhydrogen they become crimson, but the sound is almost inaudible because\r\nof the physical character of the gas. In carbonic acid gas they are\r\nalmost the same as in atmospheric air, only more irregular. In dry\r\nmuriatic gas they are nearly white and very bright. In coal gas the\r\ncolours vary—sometimes being green and sometimes red. Occasionally the\r\nsame spark will be red and green at different extremities, and even\r\n_black_ portions have been observed. The density and pressure of the\r\natmosphere has been proved to exercise considerable influence upon the\r\nspark discharge.\r\n\r\nThe “Brush” discharge is shown in “a series of intermittent discharges\r\nwhich appear continuous.” This discharge assumes the shape of a fan.\r\n“It is accompanied with a low chattering sound,” which is the result of\r\nthe separate and continuous discharges, and Faraday also demonstrated\r\nthat its effects varied according to the medium in which it was\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the air pressure on electricity may be observed in the\r\nfollowing way:—\r\n\r\nIf we pass a spark through rarefied air by an apparatus known as the\r\nElectric Egg, we may obtain many curious effects. The “egg” consists\r\nof a glass globe, through which enter two rods with a knob upon each\r\ninside end. The upper rod is moveable, and held in its place by a “cap”\r\nlike the lower rod. There is a stop-cock in the lower cap, so that the\r\negg may be fastened to any plate or stand. When the egg is filled with\r\nair, the electric spark passed into the glass globe has the usual\r\nappearance, but as the air is gradually rarefied by an air-pump, the\r\nspark assumes beautiful forms and colours. As the exhaustion continues,\r\nhowever, we shall find the spark decreasing in brilliancy, and finally\r\nthe spark will cease to be visible. It thus is shown that the colour\r\nof the spark depends upon the gaseous medium and on the material of\r\nthe conductors, and when the electric spark is faint this medium can\r\nbe observed, for nitrogen will produce a blue tinge and carbonic acid\r\na green; hydrogen gives us a red, as already remarked. By multiplying\r\nthe number of eggs and plates of glass, and placing discs of tinfoil\r\nin various shapes at certain distances, many beautiful figures may be\r\nobserved when the spark is set free.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall at the Royal Institution showed a very pretty\r\nexperiment. He took a funnel with a very fine bore, and permitted\r\nsand to flow from it as it will in the hour-glass. When he permitted\r\nthe electric current to come in contact with the sand, however, it,\r\ninstead of falling vertically to the table, spread out fan-like, each\r\ngrain repelling and being repelled by its neighbour with an effect very\r\nbeautiful to see. Luminous effects have frequently been produced by\r\npassing an electric spark through various bodies. For instance, a lump\r\nof sugar can be made quite brilliant in the dark by passing electricity\r\nthrough it, and there are other substances similarly affected. Even\r\neggs and some fruits are thus made phosphorescent. The illumination of\r\nthe “diamond” covered Leyden jar is familiar to all who ever attended a\r\nlecture on Electricity.\r\n\r\nThe various effects of the electric discharge need not here be\r\ndescribed. We have witnessed the results of lightning, but even in our\r\nlaboratory many pretty little experiments can be made, such as the\r\nperforation of a card by the electric discharge. The chemical effects\r\nare various. Decomposition of water is effected by electricity, and the\r\ndischarge can also be, and has been utilized for military purposes,\r\nsuch as employed by Professor Abel in his fuse, and in his apparatus\r\nfor firing mines. Experiments at Chatham and elsewhere have been very\r\nsuccessful in the application of electricity to modern warfare.\r\n\r\nWe will illustrate one or two of these. A thick card should be placed,\r\nas in the illustration (fig. 216), between two insulated points, and\r\nto the lower portion of the apparatus a chain be attached, held in the\r\nhand, and wound round the Leyden jar. If then the knob of the jar and\r\nthe knob above the upper point be brought together, the spark will pass\r\nthrough the card.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.—Experiment with card.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner a glass may be perforated if the current be\r\nstronger. Of course the whole apparatus—and particularly the plate—must\r\nbe quite dry, and it will be better to put a drop of oil under the\r\nupper needle point so as to prevent the electricity spreading over the\r\nglass. The glass will be found pierced by the electric spark when the\r\nLeyden jar is brought into requisition (fig. 217).\r\n\r\nIt was at one time contended that the sudden expansion of the air by\r\nthe electric spark caused heat to be generated, and a thermometer was\r\ninvented by Kinnersley to show this. The illustration (fig. 218) will\r\nexplain it. When the electric spark passed between the balls in the\r\nlarge tube the water rose in the smaller. But the immediate return of\r\nthe water to its level showed that the disturbance was only mechanical,\r\nand not owing to heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.—Experiment with glass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.—Kinnersley’s thermometer.]\r\n\r\nWe may now pass from the “frictional” to the other kind—viz.,\r\n“dynamical” electricity, and we shall begin with the consideration of\r\nGALVANI’S experiments and the VOLTAIC PILE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric condenser.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] GANOT: _Eléments de Physique_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nGALVANISM.\r\n\r\n GALVANI’S DISCOVERY—THE FROGS ELECTRIFIED—EXPERIMENTS—VOLTA’S PILE—THE\r\n TEST—ITS USEFULNESS—FARADAY’S “RESEARCHES.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGalvanism owes its origin to the researches of Galvani, the celebrated\r\nprofessor of Bologna, and we are indebted to what was a mere “accident”\r\nfor our knowledge of this science.\r\n\r\nBefore Galvani’s time there had been many instances adduced of animal\r\nelectricity. The Rev. F. Lunn, in his article upon Electricity,[15]\r\nmentions the fact that fire streamed from the head of Servius Tullius\r\nwhen about seven years of age, and Virgil we know refers to flame\r\nemitted by the hair of Ascanius—\r\n\r\n  “Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pasci”;\r\n\r\nand if any one will comb his or her hair with an ebonite comb in the\r\ndark, with what is sometimes called an “india-rubber comb,” the hair\r\nwill give out sufficient light to enable the operator to see himself\r\nin a looking-glass. In olden days it is related that a lady when\r\ntouched with a linen cloth emitted sparks, and the same phenomenon\r\nwas observable when a bookseller at Pisa removed his under-garment\r\nor vest (De Castro). We are all aware of the electricity of the cat\r\nand of certain fishes (_see_ Electricity of Animals in sequel), and\r\n“torpedos.” Galvani had of course a knowledge of this property, and had\r\noccupied himself for some time making experiments upon the electricity\r\nin animals. He was not in his laboratory that day when the great\r\ndiscovery was made by means of the edible frog.\r\n\r\nGalvani’s wife was just then in a very delicate state of health,\r\nand in accordance with usage had been ordered soup made from frogs.\r\nIt is related that some of these animals, ready skinned, were lying\r\nupon the laboratory table, for the Professor had been just previously\r\ninvestigating the question of what he opined was “animal” electricity;\r\nthat is, he fancied that muscular motion depended upon that subtle\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe electric machine was in action, and one of the attendants happening\r\nto approach or touch one of the frogs, the man as well as Madame\r\nGalvani observed that the limbs were violently agitated. Galvani was\r\nat once informed of this, and he made repeated experiments, which\r\nshowed him that the convulsive movements only took place when a spark\r\nwas drawn from the prime conductor of the electric machine, and while\r\nthe nerve was touched by a conductor. Galvani then suspended a number\r\nof frogs to a railing by metal hooks, with a view to experiment upon\r\nthem with atmospherical electricity. But the frogs’ limbs were again\r\nagitated when no electricity was apparent, and Galvani after some\r\nconsideration came to the conclusion that the movement was owing to the\r\nposition the animals assumed with reference to the metallic bodies.\r\nThus when muscle and nerve were in contact with metallic bodies and\r\nconnected by metal, the movements of the limbs were observable, and\r\nthe greater the surface contact the greater was the convulsion. The\r\nphilosopher next tried various metals, and discovered that the most\r\npowerful combination was zinc and silver.\r\n\r\nGalvani, in 1791, published his discovery and his theory that the body\r\nacted as a Leyden jar, different parts being in a different state of\r\nelectricity. No sooner were his deductions published than all Europe\r\nwas in a ferment, and philosophers of all nations were discussing\r\nit. Fowler, Valli, Robison, Wells, Humboldt, etc., all were deeply\r\ninterested, but none of them appear to have arrived at so correct\r\nconclusions as did Volta, the physician of Pavia. “Wherever frogs were\r\nto be found,” says Du Bois Reymond, “and where two different kinds of\r\nmetal could be procured, everybody was anxious to see the mangled limbs\r\nof frogs brought to life in this wonderful way. Physiologists believed\r\nthat at length they should realize their visions of a vital power, and\r\nphysicians thought no cure was impossible.”\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the popular theory, Volta, in his letters to\r\nCarallo, while giving a full and clear account of the discovery made\r\nby Galvani and his own experiments, attacked and finally defeated the\r\nProfessor. Volta quite upset Galvani’s Leyden-jar theory; Volta says\r\nthat it was by accident that Mr. Galvani discovered the phenomenon, and\r\nby which he was more astonished than he ought to have been. Volta’s\r\nletters will be found in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal\r\nSociety (in French), and he attributes the effect to the metals which\r\nproduced a small amount of electricity. He found that the nerve was\r\nacted upon on even parts of a muscle laid upon two different metals,\r\nand if those were united, a contraction took place.\r\n\r\n“Many experiments were made in all parts of Europe,” says Doctor Roget,\r\nand “an opinion had been very prevalent that the real source of the\r\npower developed existed in the muscle and nerve which formed part of\r\nthe circuit, and that the metals which composed the other part acted\r\nmerely as the conductors by which that agency was transferred from the\r\none to the other of these animal structures. But the discoveries of\r\nVolta dispelled the error, by proving that the sources of power were\r\nderived from the galvanic properties of the metals themselves when\r\ncombined with certain fluids,” and decided that this principle was\r\nelectricity. From this the “general fact” was deduced—viz., “that when\r\na certain portion of a nerve which is distributed to any muscle is made\r\npart of a galvanic circuit, convulsions, generally of a violent and\r\nconvulsive kind, are produced in that muscle.”\r\n\r\nVolta at length made the discovery that when two metals were brought\r\ntogether electricity was developed, and by uniting a disc of copper\r\nand one of zinc, and subjecting them to the test of an Electroscope,\r\nhe found positive and negative electricity developed in the zinc and\r\ncopper respectively; so Volta came to the conclusion that each metal\r\nparted with electricity, and one became all “positive” and the other\r\nall “negative.” But when he came further to consider the possibility\r\nof building up a “pile” of these metal discs sufficiently strong to\r\nproduce electric effects, he found that if his theory were correct he\r\nwould lose from one side of the metal all he would gain from the other,\r\nand therefore he could never obtain more than the slight effect he had\r\noriginally produced.\r\n\r\nThis was at first a difficulty apparently impossible to remove. It\r\nwas so self-evident that the discs of metal, if placed in a pile in a\r\nseries of pairs, would continually exercise like effects to the first\r\npair of discs, that Volta was puzzled, and for some time he could\r\nnot arrive at any reasonable solution. At last it struck him that\r\nif he placed between the discs some slow-conducting substance, the\r\nelectricity would not pass from disc to disc, and the force developed\r\nor set in motion would be more powerful.\r\n\r\nHe made the experiment. The result was the Voltaic pile made in 1800,\r\nof which we give an illustration (fig. 219). A communication on the\r\nsubject of Electricity by contact, written by M. Volta, is to be found\r\nin the _Philosophical Proceedings_ for the year 1800.\r\n\r\nVolta constructed the pile which bears his name, on the assumption\r\nthat “every two heterogeneous bodies form a galvanic circle or arc in\r\nwhich electricity is generated.” The “pile” consisted of a number of\r\ndiscs of zinc and copper separated by discs of card soaked in water.\r\nThis combination of metals separated by a bad conductor, developed\r\nconsiderable electricity, the “positive” going to the zinc at the top,\r\nand the “negative” turning to the opposite end. By touching the zinc\r\nand copper extremities simultaneously with wetted fingers we shall\r\nexperience a shock. “I don’t need your frog,” Volta said, when he had\r\nproved his theory; “give me two metals and a moist rag, and I will\r\nproduce your animal electricity. Your frog is nothing but a moist\r\nconductor, and in this respect it is inferior to my wet rag!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.—Voltaic Pile.]\r\n\r\nAfter this discovery the theory of animal electricity died away for\r\nmany years, till in 1825, Nobili, and afterwards Matteucci, proved the\r\nexistence of galvanic currents in muscles.\r\n\r\nAfter Volta had succeeded in obtaining a shock from his “pile,”\r\nhe proceeded to the construction of another instrument, or rather\r\napparatus, which he denominated “Couronne des tasses” (fig. 220). It\r\nconsisted of a series of small glasses containing water or a saline\r\nsolution. He then procured a number of “metallic arcs,” partly composed\r\nof zinc and partly of copper; these were inserted into the glasses, so\r\nthat every glass contained the zinc of one and the copper of another\r\narc, not in contact, but one at the right hand the other at the left.\r\nThe electro motion, supposed to be the primary cause of the galvanic\r\naction, was thus produced as well as from the “pile.” The principle was\r\njust the same in both apparatus, the metals being divided by the water\r\nin one case, and by a wet card or cloth in the other.\r\n\r\nVolta, in 1800, addressed to the Royal Society his celebrated letter\r\nupon electricity excited by contact of conducting substances, and then\r\nthe English philosophers proceeded to make further experiments. It\r\nwas Fabroni of Florence who had just before suggested that chemical\r\naction was really the cause of the phenomena exhibited. Sir Humphrey\r\nDavy warmly advocated this theory, and made numerous experiments with\r\nthe view to establish it. Nicholson, Carlisle, and Cruickshank also\r\npaid great attention to the subject. Volta, although he had laid the\r\nfoundation, did not venture to build upon it. Messrs. Nicholson and\r\nCarlisle found the two kinds of electricity in the pile, the zinc\r\nbeing positive and the silver negative. They also found that the\r\nwater was decomposed both in the circuit and in the body of the pile.\r\nSubsequently Cruickshank confirmed Nicholson’s observations, and made\r\nuse of what is termed the “trough” apparatus. He found that hydrogen\r\nwas emitted from the silver or upper end, and oxygen from the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.—Volta’s couronne des tasses.]\r\n\r\nThese discoveries opened up a wide field. “The power of the pile\r\nin decomposing chemical substances was now established.” Dr. Henry\r\nemployed galvanism for analysis, and Sir Humphrey Davy invented new\r\ncombinations of substances. He formed a pile of charcoal and zinc,\r\nand found out that a pile could consist of only one metal, different\r\nfluids being applied to the opposite surfaces separated by water, and\r\none fluid “capable of oxidating the metal, the other of preventing the\r\neffect of oxidation.” Soon after a pile was made of charcoal.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Sir H. Davy gave the results of his researches to the world\r\nupon the electro-chemical action of bodies. In the course of his\r\nexperiments he found out the chemical constituents of the alkalies, and\r\na surprising number of new things were brought to light, and chemical\r\nscience received a most astonishing ally. Sir W. S. Harris says: “A\r\nseries of new substances were speedily discovered, the existence of\r\nwhich had never before been imagined. Oxygen, chlorine, and acids\r\nwere all dragged, as it were, to the positive pole, while metals,\r\ninflammable bodies, alkalies, and earths became determined to the\r\nnegative pole of the (galvanic) battery. When wires connected with each\r\nextremity of the new battery were tipped with prepared and well-pointed\r\ncharcoal, and the points brought near each other, then a most intense\r\nand pure evolution of light followed, which on separating the points\r\nextended to a gorgeous arc.” So the elements of all bodies were\r\nseparated and the composition of their compounds closely investigated.\r\n\r\nMichael Faraday threw himself _con amore_ into the question. He\r\nset about to classify the pile phenomena, and arranged them with\r\nappropriate terms, and in a series of papers, between the years 1830\r\nand 1840 (_see_ his “Experimental Researches”), he explained the\r\nchemical effects of voltaic electricity and electro-magnetic induction.\r\nHe showed that the electricities obtainable from the voltaic pile and\r\nthe electrical machine are essentially the same in their action. He\r\nproved that the theory held respecting the necessity for the presence\r\nof water in electro-chemical composition was erroneous, and that\r\nmany other fluids and compounds were equally effective. We have not\r\nspace at our disposal to include a digest of his various lectures and\r\npapers. He calculated that as much electricity is employed in holding\r\nthe gases oxygen and hydrogen together in a grain of water, “as is\r\npresent in a discharge of lightning.” When water is decomposed by\r\nthe electric current, the force which determines the oxygen and acid\r\nmatter held in solution to the positive, while the hydrogen passes to\r\nthe negative pole, is not in the poles, but in the body decomposed, he\r\nsays. “The poles,” writes Faraday, “are merely the surfaces or doors\r\nby which the electricity enters into or passes out of the decomposing\r\nsubstance. They limit the extent of that substance in the course of the\r\nelectric current, being its termination in that direction. Hence the\r\nelements evolved passed so far and no farther.” Faraday named the poles\r\n“electrodes”—the way (in or out) of electricity.\r\n\r\nA very simple voltaic pile may be constructed with “gold-leaf” paper.\r\nTake two sheets of the gold paper and paste them back to back,\r\nand two of silver paper; cut them into discs about the size of a\r\nfive-shilling-piece (or even of half-a-crown), and place them one on\r\nthe top of the other, so as the gold and silver may be alternate; press\r\nthe discs together slightly when a good many layers have been piled up,\r\nand introduce them into a glass tube; close the ends of the tubes with\r\ncorks through which wires are passed from the discs top and bottom. It\r\nwill be found that the ends are charged with opposite electricities.\r\nThis is the _Zamboni_ pile, or the dry pile, which was constructed of\r\nhundreds of paper discs “tinned on one side, and covered with binoxide\r\nof manganese on the other,” put into a tube, and closed with brass\r\nstoppers. The electricity will last a long time in a dry pile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.—The Galvanic Pile.]\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration of the Galvanic Pile a disc of copper\r\nis at the bottom and a disc of zinc at the top. The latter, P,\r\nis the positive pole; the former, N, the negative. When the\r\nwires are united the current is closed, and no sign of disturbance can\r\nbe detected, although the action, of course, is proceeding within the\r\npile. The opposite kinds of electricity neutralize each other, and if a\r\ncontinuous supply were not kept up the electricity would disappear; but\r\nas it is, a powerful current is obtained, and if the wire be divided a\r\nspark will be observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.—Bunsen Battery.]\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of galvanic batteries. The Trough Battery or\r\nCruickshank has been mentioned. There is Wollaston’s Pile, Bunsen’s\r\nBattery, Grove’s Battery, and Daniell’s, called the “Constant” Battery.\r\nIn this last a porous earthenware cell is placed within a cylinder\r\nof copper; in the cell a rod of zinc is inserted, the cell being\r\nfilled with diluted sulphuric acid,—one part of acid to ten parts of\r\nwater,—and in the outer cylinder is a solution of sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.—Daniell’s Battery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.—Grove’s Battery.]\r\n\r\nThe cut above illustrates Daniell’s Battery (fig. 223) with connectors.\r\n\r\nIn _Bunsen’s Battery_ (or the Zinc-Carbon Battery), which is very like\r\nthe “Daniell” arrangement, as will be seen from the plates (figs. 222,\r\n223), the porous cell has a prism of carbon immersed in it, and is\r\napparently a modification of the powerful “Grove” Battery (fig. 224).\r\nThis consists of slips of platinum, _h_, placed in porous cells, _g_,\r\neach cell being surrounded by a glass cylinder. The outer (glass) cells\r\nare filled, or nearly filled, with diluted sulphuric acid; nitric\r\nacid is used in the porous cells, and a platinum plate inserted. The\r\nchemical action of the Grove cell is thus explained by Professor\r\nStewart: “The zinc dissolves in the dilute sulphuric acid, and during\r\nthis process hydrogen gas is given off. But this hydrogen does not\r\nrise up in the shape of bubbles; it finds its way into the porous\r\nvessel which contains the strong nitric acid. It there decomposes the\r\nacid, taking some oxygen to itself, so as to become water (hydrogen\r\nand oxygen forming water), and thereby turning the nitric into nitrous\r\nacid, which shows its presence by strong orange-coloured fumes.” By\r\nthis decomposition of the nitric acid the polarization of the platinum\r\n(due to hydrogen) is avoided. The porous cell, while keeping the\r\nliquids apart, does not interfere with the chemical action.\r\n\r\nA great number of cells are used in the Grove Battery; perhaps even a\r\nhundred may be employed.\r\n\r\n_Smee’s Battery_ consists of a plate of platinized silver, S, with a\r\nbar of wood to prevent contact with the zinc on each side, Z. These are\r\nimmersed in a glass jar, A, which contains dilute sulphuric acid. The\r\ncurrent is obtained by metallic communication with the binding-screws\r\non the top. This battery has much the same general arrangement as\r\nWollaston’s—the position of the plates being, however, reversed; in the\r\nlatter there are two negative plates to one positive. In Smee’s Battery\r\nthere are two positive (zinc) plates to one negative plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.—Smee’s Cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.—Smee’s Battery.]\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood how an electric current is produced; the\r\nelectricity passing through the cells, etc., to wires, confers certain\r\nproperties upon the wires, and we can ascertain the effect of the\r\ncurrent by means of a _Galvanometer_, an instrument used to detect the\r\nstrength and direction of electric currents. The current will evolve\r\nheat and light; it will excite muscular action, and will decompose\r\nsubstances into their constituent elements. The deflection of the\r\nmagnetic needle by the electric current is considered the best evidence\r\nof its power; it is on this that the Galvanometer is based.\r\n\r\nWe can perform a few simple experiments with the current. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, that a piece of fine wire be fixed between the pole wires of\r\nthe battery; it will be heated “white hot.” Or if two carbon points\r\nbe approached in a glass of water, as in the illustration (fig. 227),\r\nthey will emit a brilliant light in the fluid from the _voltaic arc_\r\nwhich has given us the electric light. The current is the passage of\r\nelectricity along the wire, and continues until the working power or\r\n“potential” of one conductor is equal to that of the other. When they\r\nbecome equal of course the action ceases, as there is equilibrium. But\r\nwhen an apparatus like the galvanic battery is brought to bear so that\r\nthe force of electricity from one conductor is made always greater than\r\nthat of the other conductor, we have a continuous flow while the action\r\nof the battery goes on. One view of the principle is thus expressed by\r\nProfessor Gordon:[16]\r\n\r\n“If two metals be placed near together, but not in contact, in a liquid\r\nwhich acts chemically more upon one than upon the other, the metals\r\nbecome charged, so that the one least acted on is of higher potential\r\nthan the one most acted on. The difference of potential produced\r\ndepends only upon the nature of the metals and of the liquid, and not\r\non the size or position of the plates. As soon as the difference of\r\npotential has reached its constant value the chemical action ceases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.—The Voltaic arc.]\r\n\r\n“If now the metals are connected by a wire outside the liquid the\r\ndifference of potential begins to diminish, and an electric current\r\nflows through the wire. As soon as the difference of potential becomes\r\nless than the maximum for the metals and liquid, chemical action\r\nrecommences and brings it up to the maximum; and thus if no disturbing\r\ncause interferes the current will continue until the metal most acted\r\non is entirely dissolved.”\r\n\r\nThe metal most acted on is considered the “generating plate,” and is\r\n“positive.” The other attacked less is “negative,” and is known as\r\nthe “collecting plate,” and the zinc is the positive plate. Sir W.\r\nThomson has shown that the electrical movement in the galvanic circuit\r\nis entirely due to the electrical difference produced at the surfaces\r\nof contact of the dissimilar metals. The electro-motive force obtained\r\nis not the same with all metals. We have mentioned that some are\r\nelectro-positive and some electro-negative, and it is with reference\r\nto each other that the metals are considered to be endowed with these\r\nproperties respectively. It all depends how the metals are arranged or\r\ncoupled. With reference to their behaviour in this respect scientists\r\nhave arranged them in a series, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1.  Zinc.\r\n  2.  Cadmium.\r\n  3.  Tin.\r\n  4.  Lead.\r\n  5.  Iron.\r\n  6.  Nickel.\r\n  7.  Bismuth.\r\n  8.  Antimony.\r\n  9.  Copper.\r\n  10. Silver.\r\n  11. Gold.\r\n  12. Platinum.\r\n  13. Graphite.\r\n\r\nEach metal in the list is arranged so that it is electro-positive to\r\nany one below, and electro-negative to any one above it.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious fact which should be mentioned. In associating\r\nthese metals it has been found that when two are brought into contact\r\nthe electro-motive force becomes greater the more distant they are in\r\nthe series given above; in other words, the force between any two is\r\nequal to the sum of the forces between those intervening between those\r\ntwo. So when zinc is used with copper its force is not so great as when\r\nused with platinum.\r\n\r\nIt was Herr G. S. Ohm who laid down the law that the strength of\r\nthe electric current is equal to the electro-motive force divided\r\nby the resistance, for he proved that the “resistance was inversely\r\nproportional to the strength of a current.”\r\n\r\nThere are two other laws respecting currents; viz.,—\r\n\r\n(1.) Parallel currents in the same direction attract each other.\r\n\r\n(2.) Parallel currents in opposite directions repel each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. Chemical action of electricity. Fig. 229.]\r\n\r\nUpon these two hang all the varied phenomena of electro-dynamics. That\r\nchemical action develops electricity we can perceive with the aid of\r\nthe two cuts (figs. 228 and 229). If the wires be attached to the\r\ncollecting-plate of a condenser of electricity and the metal plate of a\r\ncell, as shown in the figure (fig. 228), the electricity on the plate\r\nwill be negative. If the operation be reversed, and the plate be put in\r\nconnection with the acid, and the metal with the earth, the instrument\r\nwill be charged with positive electricity. In the other case, when two\r\ncups are used, united by a magnet so that the solutions (one acid and\r\nthe other alkaline) can by capillary attraction unite upon the binding\r\nof the magnet, and we place the wires as in fig. 229, the charge on\r\nthe plate will be positive if it be in connection with the acid, and\r\nnegative if in communication with the alkaline solution. Every time\r\nthere is chemical action between two bodies in contact electricity\r\nis produced—positive on one negative on the other, and that is the\r\nfundamental principle of the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of water can also be effected by means of the\r\nelectric current. If two tubes or vessels be placed in a vase of water,\r\nand the wires from the battery be inserted in them respectively, the\r\noxygen will go to the platinum or positive pole wire, and the hydrogen\r\nto the zinc or negative pole. This decomposition or “splitting up” of\r\ncomponents was termed ELECTROLYSIS by Faraday, who gave a\r\nseries of names to the action and the actors in these phenomena (fig.\r\n230).\r\n\r\nAny liquid body, such as the water we have just decomposed for\r\ninstance, Faraday termed an _electrolyte_; the surfaces where the\r\ncurrent enters or leaves the body were called _electrodes_—the “ways,”\r\nfrom _odos_, a “way”; the entry is the _anode_; the leaving point\r\nthe _katode_, from _ana_, “up,” and _kata_, “down.” The electrolyte\r\nis divided into two portions, “ions” (“movers”), which move towards\r\nthe electrodes, which are positive and negative. In the case of the\r\ndecomposition of water the hydrogen goes to the negative electrode, the\r\noxygen to the positive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.—Decomposition of water.]\r\n\r\nThere are a few observations to be made respecting electrolysis. One\r\nrule is, that it “never takes place unless the electrolyte is in a\r\nliquid state.” The liquid state is essential. It is also observed\r\nthat the components go to the different electrodes; such elements as\r\ngo to the negative electrode are termed electro-positive, the others\r\nelectro-negative; or, as Faraday termed them, “anions” or “kations:”\r\nThe chemical power or electrolytic action of the current is the same at\r\nall parts of the circuit; the quantity of the substance decomposed is\r\nin exact proportion to the strength of the current. Faraday measured\r\nthe strength of the electric current, and invented for the purpose an\r\ninstrument called the Voltameter. We have mentioned the Galvanometer\r\nmore than once, and will proceed to describe it. There are several\r\nforms of this instrument: the Tangent, the Marine, and the Reflecting\r\nGalvanometers, and the Astatic, or “Multiplier.” In the first-named the\r\ndirection of the current is determined by Ampère’s rule, which is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“Imagine an observer placed in the wire so that the current shall pass\r\nthrough him from his feet to his head; let him turn his face to the\r\nneedle: its north pole is always deflected to his left side.”\r\n\r\nThe _“Tangent” Galvanometer_ consists of a vertical circle like an\r\nupright ring, across which is a support in the centre holding a\r\ncopper wire, through which the electric current passes. On this point\r\n(where the wire is) a needle is very lightly supported, and when the\r\ninstrument is to be used it is placed so that the plane of the circle\r\nis parallel to the line in which the needle points. The current passes,\r\nand the needle is deviated. By noting which side the north end of the\r\nneedle goes the _direction_ of the current is ascertained, and the\r\nlength of the needle being small in comparison with the diameter of the\r\ncircle through which the current passes, the _strength_ of the current\r\nin the vertical circle is in proportion to the _tangent_ of the angle\r\nthrough which the needle turns. Hence the term “Tangent” Galvanometer.\r\n\r\nThe “Reflecting” instrument is the invention of Sir William Thomson, in\r\nwhich a mirror is attached to the needle, and reflects a small focus of\r\nlight upon a scale. The movements, however minute, are easily read. Sir\r\nW. Thomson’s Galvanometers are extremely sensitive. We need not mention\r\nany other varieties, as full descriptions can easily be obtained. We\r\nonly need to indicate the mode of working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231.—Galvanometer.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration (fig. 231) shows an Astatic Galvanometer\r\nwhich may be used in two ways—either to measure strength of current,\r\nor to find out a current; in the latter case it would be termed a\r\nGalvanoscope. It is a compound needle instrument, and consists of two\r\nneedles placed in parallel directions with opposite poles above each\r\nother in a coil. The wire coil is wound round a bobbin, and the astatic\r\nneedle is placed therein and suspended freely, as in the illustration,\r\nby a cocoon thread. The upper needle moves upon a scale, O\r\nO, and the instrument is enclosed in a glass shade. The screw,\r\nV, communicates with the upper needle, and fixes it at zero\r\npoint when ready for use. The wires are fastened to the binding-screws,\r\nand the current is then sent. The needle is deflected accordingly, and\r\nthe number of degrees on the scale can be read off.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the galvanic current are many. Amongst them Electroplating\r\nis perhaps the most generally useful, though Electrotyping is also a\r\nvery important process in art. A visitor to Birmingham may view the\r\nprocess carried on there by some enterprising firms, who have succeeded\r\nwonderfully in producing electro-plate. The principle is very simple\r\nand easy to understand, but the greatest care and watchfulness are\r\nrequired on the part of the men employed. The principle, as we have\r\nsaid, is simple, and consists in the fact that if a plate of metal be\r\nsuspended and attached to the positive pole of a galvanic battery and\r\nimmersed in a solution of the same metal, the conducting substance hung\r\nopposite at the negative pole becomes coated with the metal immersed in\r\nthe solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.—Trough for electro-deposition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.—Plates immersed.]\r\n\r\nSuppose we take a plate of silver, and immerse it in cyanide of\r\nsilver dissolved in cyanide of potassium; a coating of silver will\r\nbe deposited upon the nickel spoon or other article suspended at the\r\nother pole. But to make the coating adhere the spoons, forks, etc.,\r\nare prepared for the bath by cleansing in caustic potash to remove\r\ngrease, and washed in nitric acid to remove all traces of oxide, then\r\nare scoured with sand. Next, a thin coating of mercury is put on by\r\nimmersion in solution of nitrate of mercury. Finally, they are hung\r\nin the bath. A metal rod is hung across the bath (fig. 232), and the\r\nplate is immersed. If the rod to which the articles are suspended be\r\nattached to the zinc or negative pole, and the plate of silver to the\r\npositive pole of the battery, decomposition begins, and the silver\r\nbegins to attach itself to the suspended objects. If it be desirable\r\nto give the plated articles a thick coating, they are retained for a\r\nlong time in the bath, which is of some non-conducting material. The\r\ndull appearance is easily removed by brushing and burnishing, and then\r\nthe “Electro-plate” is ready for the warehouse. The gilding process is\r\nperformed in the same manner, a gold plate being substituted for the\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.—Medico-galvanic Battery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.—Battery in case.]\r\n\r\nELECTROTYPING may be briefly explained as follows:—Take two vessels, A\r\nand B, and in one, A, put some dilute sulphuric acid and two plates,\r\none of zinc, Z, the other of copper, D, but be sure they are not\r\ntouching each other; each of these plates must have a piece of wire\r\nfastened, by soldering to their upper parts. In the vessel, B, put some\r\nsolution of sulphate of copper and a small quantity of dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and attach another copper plate to the wire which comes from the\r\ncopper plate in the acid; this second copper plate is to be immersed in\r\nthe solution of sulphate of copper, and to the wire from the zinc plate\r\nis to be fixed the object to be coated. If a medallion or other object\r\nin plaster, it should be soaked in very hot wax and then brushed over\r\nwith blacklead until the surface is perfectly blackened and bright;\r\nthe wire should be bound all round the margin and soldered (as it\r\nwere) with melted wax to the medallion, taking care that this wax also\r\nis well coated with blacklead. If the object be now immersed in the\r\nsulphate of copper solution and kept at a short distance from the plate\r\n(it must not touch it), a coating of copper will soon cover the surface\r\nand form a perfect cast, which, when of sufficient thickness, may be\r\nremoved by filing the edge all round. If instead of the plaster cast\r\na copper coin or other copper object be used, the blackleading is not\r\nrequired, but the surface must be first made clean and bright.\r\n\r\nMany uses are made of the galvanic current by medical men. If the\r\ncircuit of the pile is closed and we take a wire in each hand and\r\nbreak contact, a concussion will be felt in the joints of the arm and\r\nfingers, and a certain contraction of the muscles. The currents of\r\nelectricity cause the shocks, and by a peculiar arrangement by which\r\nthe circuit can be closed or broken at pleasure, a series of shocks can\r\nbe sent through the body when it forms the connection between the poles\r\nof the battery. We give illustrations of a medico-galvanic machine.\r\nIn fig. 235 there are two batteries, A and B, with cells, C D. Each\r\nbattery consists of a central plate of platinized silver separated\r\nfrom the zinc plates by a piece of wood, E and F; the binding-screws\r\nare fastened to the silver plates, and G H retain the zinc plates; I\r\nis a copper band connecting the zinc plate of one battery with the\r\nsilver plate of the other. At Z and opposite are wires leading to the\r\ncoil machine. The quantity and intensity of the current are regulated\r\nrespectively by the indicator, O, and the wires, Q. There is a point, R\r\nS, for the breaking of the contact; P N are screws retaining the wires\r\nwhich lead to the handles, U V, grasped by the patients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236. Fig. 237. Fig. 238.\r\n\r\nHorse-shoe magnets.]\r\n\r\nThe electric current is employed in many diseases, and is of great use\r\nin some cases, but the further consideration of it with reference to\r\nits medical applications does not fall within the scope of our present\r\nwork. We will now pass on to one of the most useful applications of the\r\nelectric force, the Telegraph, and in dealing with it we must make a\r\nfew remarks upon magnetism. First, let us make an experiment or two,\r\nand see the reciprocal action between electricity and magnetism.\r\n\r\n(1.) If we take a piece of iron of the form of a horse-shoe (fig. 236),\r\nand wind around it copper wire, and pass through the wire an electric\r\ncurrent from our battery, the iron will exhibit strong magnetic\r\nproperties, which it will lose when the current is interrupted. The\r\nconducting wires are insulated with silk, and the current will then\r\ntravel in one direction.\r\n\r\n(2.) If we cover the ends of a non-magnetic piece of iron with coils\r\nof wire, and rotate the magnet, A B, so as to cause the poles to\r\napproach each end of the iron alternately, an electric current will be\r\nestablished in the wire.\r\n\r\n(3.) Referring to the first experiment, if we bring a needle in contact\r\nwith the iron horse-shoe, while the current is passing through the wire\r\nwe shall find that the needle has become a magnet; _i.e._, that it will\r\npoint due north and south when suspended.\r\n\r\nWe will now see what a Magnet is, and why it has obtained this name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.—Magnetic attraction.]\r\n\r\nIn Magnesia, in Lydia, in olden times was found a stone of peculiar\r\nattributes, which had the property of attracting small portions of\r\niron. The Chinese were acquainted with it, and nowadays it is found in\r\nmany places. In our childhood we have all read of it in the story of\r\n“Sinbad the Sailor.” Popularly it is known as the loadstone; chemists\r\ncall it magnetic oxide of iron (F_{2}O_{3}). This stone is a _natural\r\nmagnet_. In Sweden it exists in great quantities as “magnetic iron,”\r\nfor it has a great affinity for that metal.\r\n\r\nIf we rub a piece of steel upon the loadstone we convert the former\r\ninto a magnet—an artificial magnet as it is called, and the _magnetic\r\nneedle_ so useful to us in our compasses and in the working of one form\r\nof the electric telegraph is thus obtained. Let us see how this needle\r\nacts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.—Simple touch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.—Double touch.]\r\n\r\nTake a magnetic needle and dust upon it some iron filings. You will\r\nobserve that the filings will be attracted to both ends of the magnet,\r\nbut the centre will remain uncovered. The ends of a magnet are termed\r\n“poles,” the centre the equator. So one end is north and the other\r\nsouth, and we might perhaps imagine that the same characteristics would\r\nabide in the bar when it is cut in two. But we find that as when a worm\r\nis divided, each portion gets a new head or tail, and makes a perfect\r\nworm, so in the magnet each divided half becomes a perfect magnet with\r\nseparate poles, one of which always points to the north.\r\n\r\nThe poles of the magnet display the same phenomena as regards\r\nattraction and repulsion, as do the opposite kinds of electricity. If\r\nwe suspend a magnet and bring the north pole of another to the north\r\npole of the suspended magnet, the latter will turn away; but if we\r\napply the north pole of one to the south pole of the other they will be\r\nattracted just as opposite electricities attract each other.\r\n\r\nMAGNETIZATION is the term applied to the making of artificial\r\nmagnets, which act is accomplished by bringing the needle in contact\r\nwith other magnets, or sometimes by means of the electric current. If\r\nwe carefully stroke the needle with the magnet, always in the same\r\ndirection, lifting the magnet and beginning afresh every time, we shall\r\nmagnetize the needle, but with a different polarity from the pole it\r\nwas rubbed with. A magnet rubbing its _north_ pole against a needle\r\nwill make the latter’s point _south_, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen how the “magnetic needle” is arrived at, we\r\ncan proceed to explain the electric telegraph. The term telegraph is\r\nderived from the Greek words _tele_, “far,” and _graphein_, “to write,”\r\nand now includes all modes of signalling. Signalling, or telegraphing,\r\nis of very ancient origin; the Roman generals spelt words by fire.\r\nThe beacons fired on the hills, the “Fiery Cross,” and other ancient\r\nmodes are well known. The semaphore and flags have long been and are\r\nstill used as modes of signalling, while the flashing of the heliograph\r\n“telegraphs” to a distant camp.\r\n\r\nThe Semaphore was invented by Chappé, and was really the first\r\npractical system of telegraphy. It was adopted in 1794, but before\r\nthis, in 1753, a letter appeared in the _Scots Magazine_, by Charles\r\nMarshall, suggesting that signals should be given by means of electric\r\nwires, equal in number to the letters of the alphabet. Soon afterwards\r\nLesage, of Geneva, made an electric telegraph to be worked by\r\nfrictional electricity, and many ingenious attempts were subsequently\r\nmade to utilize electricity for signalling purposes, but without any\r\npermanent success; indeed, the British government were quite content\r\nwith their semaphores, for they wrote that “telegraphs of any kind are\r\nnow wholly unnecessary, and no other than the one now in use will be\r\nadopted”!\r\n\r\nThe _Electric Telegraph_ has had considerable antiquity claimed for\r\nit, but it is pretty certain that the discovery made by Doctor Watson,\r\nin 1747, that electricity would pass through wires, and that the earth\r\nwould complete the circuit, gave the first impetus to the Electric\r\nTelegraph. Doctor Watson was enabled to transmit shocks across the\r\nThames, and made experiments at Shooters Hill. Franklin did likewise\r\nacross the Schuykill in 1748, and De Luc performed the same experiments\r\non the Lake of Geneva. Both Lesage and Lomond caused pith balls to\r\ndiverge at distant points, and in 1794 Reizen made use of the electric\r\nspark for transmitting signals, and made strips of foil show out\r\ncertain letters when the spark passed. He had a wire and a return wire\r\nfor each letter of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThese were all slow advances, and subsequently many learned men in\r\nEurope sought to improve upon the ideas then promulgated. We read\r\nof telegraphs constructed at Madrid by Salvá and Betancourt in 1797\r\nand 1798, one extending for more than twenty miles. The first-named\r\ngentleman finally proposed to substitute the Voltaic pile for the usual\r\nmachine, and Ronalds and Dyar in England and New York respectively\r\nemployed frictional electricity with some success. The latter sent\r\ncharges of frictional electricity through a wire, and they were\r\nrecorded by being made to pass through litmus paper. The distances\r\nbetween the discharges were intended to indicate the letters of the\r\nalphabet, but even if the experiment was fairly tried it failed, for\r\nlittle was heard of the result.\r\n\r\nAfter the invention of Volta’s pile, which Salvá wished to adopt,\r\nSömmering began his experiments. He used thirty-five wires, set up\r\nvertically at the bottom of a glass reservoir of water, and terminating\r\nin gold points. These wires ended in the opposite direction in brass\r\nplates attached to a bar of wood. At one end the points and at the\r\nother the plates bore the same letters respectively; hydrogen at one\r\ngold point, and oxygen at another, and two different letters were\r\nindicated when the current was sent through any two plates. This\r\narrangement was afterwards improved upon, and only two wires retained.\r\n\r\nIt was not until electro-magnetism had been developed, however, that\r\nŒrstead found out the power of electricity to deflect the magnetised\r\nneedle, and in 1820, Scheweigger added a “multiplier.” Then came\r\nArago into the field with his discovery, that a “wire carrying a\r\ncurrent could magnetise a steel rod.” Ampère substituted a helix for\r\na straight wire, and Sturgeon used soft iron for steel, and developed\r\nthe electro-magnet. Daniell’s battery, and Faraday’s discoveries of\r\nmagneto-electricity and the induction coil were the means of putting\r\na constant supply of electricity at the service of the telegraph and\r\nso on, till 1830 brought out a more practical method introduced by\r\nSchilling.\r\n\r\nIn that year Baron Schilling made a telegraph, and exhibited it in 1832\r\nat Bonn. This invention, with five vertical needles, was shown to Mr.\r\nCooke in 1836. But in 1834, Gauss and Weber had succeeded in sending\r\nsignals by means of a voltaic current acting upon a magnetised needle,\r\nand this apparatus was really the first practical electric telegraph\r\nin use, and it was much improved by Professor Steinheil of Munich.\r\nThey employed a magnetic-electro machine, and caused a bar to move in\r\ncertain directions to indicate certain letters of the alphabet. This\r\nwas really of value, but Steinheil, the pupil of Gauss, assisted by his\r\ngovernment, employed only a single wire, and made the earth complete\r\nthe circuit for him instead of having a return wire as his predecessors\r\nhad. This telegraph was perfected by a series of bells, which gave\r\ndifferent tones for different letters, and he also caused the needle to\r\nmake certain tracings as it moved upon a paper slip, something like the\r\nMorse pattern, which was completed in 1837.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morse, in 1832, conceived the idea of an electric telegraph\r\nbut his claim was disputed by a Doctor Jackson, who was on the same\r\nvessel when the subject was discussed. We need not enter into the\r\ndetails of the controversy. Mr. Morse won the day, and patented his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n“It was once a popular fallacy in England and elsewhere that Messrs.\r\nCooke and Wheatstone were the original inventors of the electric\r\ntelegraph. The electric telegraph had, properly speaking, no\r\ninventor.... Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone were, however, the first who\r\nestablished a telegraph for practical purposes comparatively on a large\r\nscale, and in which the public were more nearly concerned.... Therefore\r\nit was that the names of these enterprising and talented inventors\r\ncame to the public ear, while those of Ampère and Steinheil remained\r\ncomparatively unknown.[17] The telegraph, as used in Great Britain, was\r\nthe result of the co-operation of Professors Cooke and Wheatstone.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke, in 1836, having seen the needle telegraph when in\r\nHeidelberg, made certain designs, and soon entered into partnership\r\nwith Professor Wheatstone for the application of electric telegraphs\r\nto railways. Their apparatus with five needles and five wires was put\r\nup on the London and North-Western (then London and Birmingham) and\r\nGreat Western lines, but proved too expensive. The instrument was\r\nsubsequently modified, and is used on the English railways still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.—Cell.]\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to look at the Wheatstone needle telegraph and see\r\nthe method of working it. We know already that when a pair of metallic\r\nplates are immersed in a fluid which acts chemically more rapidly on\r\nthe one than the other, and a wire connects the upper parts of these\r\nplates, this wonderful agency is set in motion, and circulates from\r\nthe one plate to the other (fig. 242). This arrangement may be best\r\nshown by using one plate of zinc and the other of copper, and a dilute\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid for the liquid; this, however, produces by\r\nfar too little of the agent to be used on a telegraphic line, there are\r\ntherefore combinations of such pairs of plates, so arranged that the\r\npower of one pair shall be added to the next in such a way that at the\r\nend of the series (called a “battery”) there shall be a great increase\r\nof the power accumulated; this arrangement is shown in fig. 244. Now\r\n(if the power be sufficient) it does not signify what length of wire\r\nthere may be between the two ends of this arrangement or “battery”;\r\nwhether they be connected by a few feet or many hundred miles, the\r\nelectricity passes instantaneously from one end to the other; and\r\nfurthermore, it has been found in practice, that this electrical\r\ninfluence can be transmitted through the earth in one direction if\r\nsent by a wire in the other; for instance, if a wire from one end of\r\nthe battery be carried on from London to Liverpool, instead of having\r\nanother from Liverpool to London, to connect the two ends of the\r\nbattery, it is found to answer the same purpose if the end of the wire\r\nat Liverpool be fastened to a plate of metal buried beneath the surface\r\nof the earth, and the other end of the battery at London furnished with\r\na similar plate, also buried. In this arrangement, the electricity\r\nwill pass beneath the surface of the earth from Liverpool to London,\r\nand through the wire from London to Liverpool, thus completing\r\nthe circuit. The end from which the electricity passes is called\r\nthe “positive electrode,” that to which it returns, the “negative\r\nelectrode.” Fig. 245 will show this arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.—The Needle Telegraph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.—The Battery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.—The circuit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246. Fig. 247. Fig. 248.\r\n\r\nMagnetic needles.]\r\n\r\nIf a bar-magnet be suspended on a pivot so that it may turn freely,\r\nit will (as is well known) turn with one end to the north, which is\r\nowing to a current of natural electricity passing round the earth in\r\nthe direction of east and west, the magnet crossing the current at\r\na right angle; and if a coil of wire coated with silk (to keep one\r\npart of the coil from another) be placed round, above, and below the\r\nlong axis of a bar of steel, as shown at fig. 246, and a current of\r\nelectricity passed through the wire, the steel becomes a magnet, and\r\nwill take a direction similar to the natural magnet, more or less, at\r\nright angles to this coil, as in fig. 247, according to the intensity\r\nof the current; and the instant this electrical current is stopped, it\r\nwill resume its former direction. This fact has been made use of to\r\nform the principal feature of all English telegraphs; such a needle is\r\nmounted in an upright position, and instead of its tendency to turn\r\nto the north, a tendency to maintain the upright position is given\r\nto it by having one of the arms of the magnet a little heavier than\r\nthe other; such a magnet having a coil of wire surrounding it. When\r\nthe electric current passes through the coil, it will turn out of the\r\nupright position to either one side or the other, according to the\r\ndirection of the current, from its tendency to assume a position at\r\nan angle thereto (fig. 248); if the current be stopped even for an\r\ninstant, then the needle, or magnet, will again assume its upright\r\nposition. The pivot of this magnet is brought forward, and has on its\r\nfront part another needle, which turns with it; this is visible on the\r\noutside of the apparatus, and is looked at to ascertain the movement of\r\nthe one within. There is also an arrangement called a “commutator,” so\r\ncontrived, that by moving a handle to the right or left, a connection\r\nshall be made with either end of the battery, and thereby cause the\r\ndirection of the current and needle to be changed at pleasure; also\r\nby moving the handle into an upright position the current shall be\r\nstopped; and finally, by a third movement, a bell shall be rung. Now,\r\nas has already been explained, when the current goes in one direction,\r\nthe magnetic needle is deflected in that direction; and when the\r\ncurrent is reversed the position of the needle is also reversed, and\r\nwhen the current is cut off the needle will resume its perpendicular\r\nposition. If two such needles and two such handles be at each station,\r\nwhen the handles at one station are moved, the needles at the other\r\nstation will take on a similar movement; and when the handles at that\r\nstation are moved, the needles at the first station will be moved to\r\ncorrespond. This constitutes the system of communication kept up by\r\nthe electric telegraphs in England; but it remains to be shown how all\r\nthe letters of the alphabet and numerals can be represented by the\r\nmovements of the two handles. These handles can be placed in eight\r\npositions (besides the upright one) by a single movement of each hand,\r\nas may be seen in fig. 249; and these eight signals if repeated, or\r\nmade twice in rapid succession will make eight more, and by being\r\nrepeated three times will constitute a third eight, making twenty-four;\r\nfinally, by a rapid motion right and left, they may be caused to\r\nsignify a fourth eight, or thirty-two signals, which are found to be\r\nsufficient for every purpose, and by practice may be both produced and\r\nread off with facility. Before a message is about to be delivered the\r\ncommutator is so placed as to ring a bell, which is done by the same\r\narrangement as in a common alarm-clock, but the action is set in motion\r\nby a peculiar contrivance, which depends upon the property a bar of\r\nsoft iron has of becoming magnetic when a wire is wound round it and a\r\ncurrent of electricity passed through this wire; this magnetic property\r\nexists only as long as the current passes, and stops the instant it is\r\ncut off. The catch of the alarm is disengaged by the movement of a bar\r\nof iron being drawn to the magnet while the current passes, and forced\r\nback again by a spring when it is stopped, thus setting in action the\r\nmechanism of the alarm; or in some cases there is a simple contrivance\r\nfor causing a rapid flow and stoppage of the electricity, so that the\r\nbar is alternately attracted by the magnet and released by the spring,\r\nand this motion rings the bell as long as it is continued. The bell\r\nis always rung to give notice that a message is about to be sent, and\r\nat the station where it rings, the bell at the former station is rung\r\nin return, to show that they are prepared to receive the message:\r\nwhich is then spelt, letter after letter, by moving the handles into\r\nthe proper positions, and as it is being sent, the eye is kept on\r\nthe dials, certain single signs are made and recognised, which will\r\ncommunicate any reply from the station to which the message is being\r\nsent, such as “repeat,” or “not understood.” The wires which convey\r\nthe electricity are made of galvanised iron (iron coated with zinc),\r\nand as they must be kept from all communication with the earth by some\r\nsubstance incapable of conducting it, they are therefore stretched\r\nbetween wooden poles (fig. 250), and rest upon sockets or supports of\r\nglass or glazed earthenware, which are both substances incapable of\r\nconducting the electricity to the earth (fig. 251), and in order that\r\nthese may be quite dry, an inverted cup of metal, glass, or earthenware\r\nis placed over it, or the whole is blown or moulded in one piece. If\r\nthe support for the wires were not kept from the rain, the wet would\r\nform a conducting surface, and allow the electricity to escape into the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.—Handles and needles of telegraph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.—Telegraph wires.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.—Insulator.]\r\n\r\nThe Telegraph Alphabet, in the two-needle instrument, now not generally\r\nused in England, is given below.\r\n\r\n                         TWO-NEEDLE ALPHABET.\r\n\r\n  Movements of            |                      |\r\n           First Needle.  |   Of Second Needle.  |Of both Needles\r\n                          |                      |   together.\r\n                          |                      |\r\n  A is signified by moving|                      |\r\n      needle once to right|                      |\r\n  B   “  “  “ once to left|                      |\r\n  C                       |By moving needle      |\r\n                          |         once to right|\r\n  D                       |    “   “ once to left|\r\n  E                       |                      |Moving to right.\r\n  F                       |                      |Moving to left.\r\n  G         twice to right|                      |\r\n  H           “    to left|                      |\r\n  I (or J)                |        Twice to right|\r\n  K                       |          “       left|\r\n  L                       |                      |Twice to right.\r\n  M                       |                      |Twice to left.\r\n  N One to right,         |                      |\r\n             one to left  |                      |\r\n  O One to left,          |                      |\r\n            one to right  |                      |\r\n  P                       |One to right,         |\r\n                          |         one to left  |\r\n  O                       |One to left,          |\r\n                          |        one to right  |\r\n  R                       |                      |One to right,\r\n                          |                      |         one to left.\r\n  S                       |                      |One to left,\r\n                          |                      |        one to right.\r\n  T Two to right,         |                      |\r\n             one to left  |                      |\r\n  U One to right,         |                      |\r\n             two to left  |                      |\r\n  V                       |Two to right,         |\r\n                          |         one to left  |\r\n  W X                     |One to right,         |\r\n                          |         two to left  |\r\n  Y                       |                      |Two to right,\r\n                          |                      |         one to left.\r\n  Z                       |                      |One to right,\r\n                          |                      |         two to left.\r\n\r\nIn the single needle instrument the letters are indicated by right and\r\nleft vibrations, from A one right, to B one right and left, and so on,\r\nincreasing to Z. This mode is now generally used.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the current passes is shown by the following\r\nillustrations (figs. 252, 253).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 252.—Passage of the current (1).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.—Passage of the current (2).]\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness, the diagram has been drawn with simple\r\nlines only. In the real needle-machine the construction is much more\r\ncomplicated; perspective drawings of it may be seen in Lardner’s\r\n“Electric Telegraph,” and numerous other works. In fig. 1, B is a\r\nsingle cell of a battery containing a plate of copper, C, and a plate\r\nof zinc, Z, immersed in sulphuric acid and water. H is the handle of\r\nthe instrument, turning from left to right, and _vice versâ_, like the\r\nhandle of a door, consisting of two pieces of brass insulated from\r\neach other by being inserted in an axis of ivory. To the ends of the\r\ntwo pieces of brass are fixed the wires, CW and ZW, leading from the\r\ncopper and zinc ends of the cell respectively. Fixed on each side of\r\nthe handle are two plates of metal, which may be called LP, the left\r\nplate, and RP, the right plate. They are connected with the needle\r\nwire, NW, which passes before and behind the magnetized needle, N,\r\nsuspended perpendicularly on its axis, with its north pole upwards.\r\nAs long as the wires, CW and ZW, remain insulated from each other,\r\nno current passes from the cell; but as soon as the handle, H, is\r\nturned, so that the copper end touches the left plate (fig. 2), and\r\nthe zinc end touches the right, communication is established between\r\nthe plates of the cell, and the current commencing at the copper\r\npasses along CW, the top half of H, into LP, along N W, travelling\r\n_up before_ and _down behind_ the needle, causing it to deflect to\r\nthe observer’s left, according to the rule given above. Reaching RP,\r\nit passes downwards to the cell to Z, and so on to C, continuing its\r\ntravels and keeping the needle deflected as long as the handle remains\r\nin contact with the plates. If it is required to deflect the needle to\r\nthe right, the handle is turned to the right, bringing its copper end\r\nin contact with the right plate, causing the current to travel in the\r\nopposite direction. By following the current from the copper to the\r\nzinc, as indicated by the arrows in fig. 3, it will be seen that it now\r\ntravels _up behind_ and _down before_ the needle, deflecting it to the\r\nobserver’s right. Thus, by causing a current of voltaic electricity to\r\npass alternately _up before_ and _down behind_, and _up behind_ and\r\n_down before_, the needle is moved to the left or the right at will.\r\nThe way in which the current is made to act on a distant needle is now\r\nsimple. The following figure (fig. 253) shows the arrangement. The\r\nleft portion of the figure represents an instrument at London, that\r\non the right an instrument at York. The needle-wire, instead of being\r\ncontinued directly to the zinc plate of the battery, passes away from\r\nthe needle over poles to York, where it joins an instrument similar in\r\nall respects to that at London. It passes similarly before and behind a\r\nmagnetized needle, joining the right plate of the instrument. As long\r\nas the two plates are unconnected, no current can pass. The current is\r\ntherefore completed by a contrivance which may be represented by the\r\nsemicircular piece of metal, K. In practice the two plates or springs,\r\nwhich, when not in use, are always pressed against the connector, K,\r\nwhich is a cross-piece on the top of the handle, keeping the London\r\nneedle in circuit with the York battery, and _vice versâ_. As soon\r\nas London uses his handle, it presses the spring-plate, and puts\r\nhis needle out of the York circuit, the current he sets up sending\r\nYork needle to the right or left, as the case maybe. The second wire\r\nconnecting the left York plate with the right London plate is, it will\r\nbe seen, not carried along like the first wire. Use is made in this\r\ncase of the conducting power of the earth itself, plates from the wires\r\nbeing buried many feet below the surface at London and York. When\r\nLondon wishes to speak to York, he first signifies his intention of so\r\ndoing by ringing York’s alarum. This he effects by sending a current\r\nthrough an electro-magnet placed above York’s instrument. The armature\r\nis attracted, and frees the detent of the alarum, setting it ringing\r\nuntil York signals ready. London then stops the bell, and commences his\r\nmessage. By following the direction of the current, when the handle is\r\nturned to the left, as in fig. 4 [within fig. 253], it will be\r\nreadily seen how this is effected: commencing with London’s copper, LC,\r\nit passes up before and down behind London’s needle, flowing along the\r\nwire between the two cities to York’s needle, up before and down behind\r\nwhich it travels, sending it also to the left. It then passes to York’s\r\nright plate, through the connector to the left plate, and so on to\r\nearth at York, coming to the surface again at London, passing through\r\nLondon’s right plate and through the lower part of the handle to the\r\nzinc of the battery. The reverse current may be easily followed. Any\r\nnumber of instruments with similar needles may be interposed along the\r\ncourse of the wire. When the operator wishes to speak to any particular\r\none, he rings all the bells for attention, and then signals Derby or\r\nNottingham, as the case may be. They all then throw their instruments\r\nout of current except the one required. The mode by which the needle\r\nmovements are converted into language is simple. A is signalled by\r\ncausing the needle to vibrate once to the right, B once right and once\r\nleft, C once right and twice left; and so on, as arranged.\r\n\r\nThe following is the alphabet (with numbers) once in use on the\r\nSouth-Eastern Railway for the double-needle instrument. The table is\r\ntaken from Mr. Walker’s translation of De la Rive’s work on Electricity\r\nand Magnetism.\r\n\r\n  A is signified by two movements of left needle to left.\r\n  B      ”       by three   ”           ”            ”\r\n  C (and fig. 1) by two     ”           ”        right first, then left.\r\n  D (and fig. 2) by two     ”           ”        left first, then right.\r\n  E (and fig. 3) by one     ”           ”        to the right.\r\n  F              by two     ”           ”              ”\r\n  G              by three   ”           ”              ”\r\n  H (and fig. 4) by one     ”       right needle to the left.\r\n  I              by two     ”           ”              ”\r\n  J (same as G).\r\n  K              by three   ”           ”              ”\r\n  L (and fig. 5) by two     ”           ”        right and left.\r\n  M (and fig. 6) by two     ”           ”        left and right.\r\n  N (and fig. 7) by one     ”           ”        to the right.\r\n  O              by two     ”           ”              ”\r\n  P              by three   ”           ”              ”\r\n  Q (same as K).\r\n  R (and fig. 8) by one parallel movement of lower points, both needles\r\n                                                             to the left.\r\n  S              by two     ”           ”              ”\r\n  T              by three   ”           ”              ”\r\n  U (and fig. 9) by two     ”           ”        first right, then left.\r\n  V (and fig. 0) by two     ”           ”        first left, then right.\r\n  W              by one movement of both needles (lower points) to right.\r\n  X              by two     ”           ”              ”           ”\r\n  Y              by three   ”           ”              ”           ”\r\n  Z (same as S) or specially.\r\n\r\nThe Morse system of telegraphy was first brought out in 1844, and was\r\nworked by means of a Voltaic battery, an electro-magnet being used at\r\nthe receiving station. This magnet attracted an “armature,” and by\r\nit dots or lines are marked on a moving paper band by a point at the\r\nother end of the wire, on the register in which the paper is carried\r\nby rollers which move out by clockwork. The lever being “tapped” down\r\nin fast or slow pressures will give a corresponding series of dots or\r\nlines (according as the pressure is long or short) upon the moving\r\nstrip of paper at the receiving station. Three taps will give C, one\r\ntap and a pause will make A. The dots are “taps” on the key, the lines\r\nbrief “rests” on it, as will be seen from the alphabet below, which is\r\ngiven as a specimen.\r\n\r\n  MORSE ALPHABET.\r\n\r\n  A .-\r\n  B -...\r\n  C .. .\r\n  D -..\r\n  E .\r\n  F .-.\r\n  G --.\r\n  H ....\r\n  I ..\r\n  J -.-.\r\n  K -.-\r\n  L -\r\n  M --\r\n  N -.\r\n  O . .\r\n  P .....\r\n  Q ..-.\r\n  R . ..\r\n  S ...\r\n  T -\r\n  U ..-\r\n  V ...-\r\n  W .--\r\n  X .-..\r\n  Y .. ..\r\n  Z ... .\r\n\r\n  NUMBERS.\r\n\r\n  1 .--.\r\n  2 ..-..\r\n  3 ...-.\r\n  4 ....-\r\n  5 ---\r\n  6 ......\r\n  7 --..\r\n  8 -....\r\n  9 -..-\r\n  0 ___\r\n\r\nThe various stops are also indicated in the same manner by combinations\r\nof dots and lines.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic telegraph cables and similar enclosed wires between other\r\ncountries are too well known to need detailed description. There\r\nis a great variety of telegraphic instruments. The dial, and other\r\narrangements, are very common, and the Wheatstone Key instrument is\r\nsupplied to private firms as being the most handy. It requires but\r\na very short apprenticeship, and any person who is handy can easily\r\nlearn to work it in a few minutes. The apparatus consists of a dial\r\nupon which the letters of the alphabet are printed, each letter being\r\nsupplied with a key or stop. A pointer is placed in the centre, as in\r\nthe wheel barometer, and there is a handle beneath. In front, upon a\r\nsloping board, is another dial plate and pointer; thus we have the\r\nreceiver and transmitter before us in a very small space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.—Receiver. Dial Telegraph. Fig.\r\n255.—Manipulator.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to work the instrument a bell is rung by turning\r\nthe handle rapidly. To speak by the instrument it is necessary to keep\r\nturning the handle with the right hand while the fingers of the left\r\nare employed in pressing down in as rapid succession as practice will\r\npermit the keys corresponding to the letters on the dial while the\r\nhandle is kept turning. When a word is completed the operator must stop\r\nat the + at the top, and then begin again, stopping after each word.\r\nWhen all is said, a couple of rapid turns of the dial will signify that\r\nyou have ended.\r\n\r\nThere are many other systems of telegraph, but all are dependent upon\r\nthe same principles. The accompanying illustrations (figs. 254, 255)\r\nshow a dial telegraph of a simple kind, which almost explains itself.\r\n\r\nThe first figure is the receiver, on which is a pointer fixed to a\r\ndial-plate having the letters of the alphabet inscribed around it.\r\nWhen the manipulator is being worked the dart points to the letters\r\nin succession of the words used, and they are separately spelt. The\r\nmanipulator (fig. 255), by closing and opening the circuit, works the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nIn the manipulator we have a wheel with an index point fixed above\r\nit. In this wheel are thirteen teeth, with the openings between them\r\nfilled with ivory. The axis of the wheel is in contact with the wire\r\nfrom the positive pole, _p_, and a spring attached to the wire or by\r\nthe binding-screw, _t_, presses against the circumference of the wheel,\r\nand completes the circuit. When the wheel is placed so that the arrow\r\npoint is above the +, the needle of the receiver is also at +. By\r\nturning the wheel to bring the needle to A, the spring on the\r\ncircumference is passed from an ivory “tooth” to a “metal” one; the\r\ncircuit is closed, the point of the receiver also turns to A,\r\nand so on through the word by successive closing and breaking of the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nAs there are a great many other applications of electricity of\r\nwhich we have to treat,—the Electric Light, and Mr. Edison’s other\r\ninventions,—our space will not permit a much more detailed account of\r\nthe telegraph, but there are some incidents connected with its progress\r\nwhich it would be as well to mention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.—Electric cable.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.—Ocean cable.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Bain, about 1840, attempted to produce a printing telegraph,\r\nand in 1846 he actually accomplished a registering apparatus, which was\r\nan application of the principles of Dyar and Davy. But although Bain’s\r\nsystem was good, Morse had the advantage of possession in the United\r\nStates, where it was tried, and Bain went out of fashion. Bain’s system\r\nwas, in fact, the present chemical “automatic” telegraph, which has\r\nbeen perfected for rapid transmission.\r\n\r\nBakewell’s instrument, which has been improved upon by later\r\nelectricians, is termed the fac-simile telegraph. The message to be\r\nsent is written with a pen which has been dipped in varnish (for ink),\r\nand the characters are inscribed upon prepared tinfoil. The message is\r\nthen put upon a cylinder covered with prepared paper, and has a pointer\r\nattached. There is a precisely similar cylinder at the receiving\r\nstation. When the cylinders are simultaneously set going, the point at\r\none will trace a spiral line as the first (transmitting) point passes\r\nround its cylinder. However, as the latter “stylus” meets the varnish\r\nletters a break occurs, and these spaces are exactly reproduced as\r\nblanks at the other end, and the form of the letters can be seen.\r\nCoselli, in his adaptation, caused dark letters to be registered on\r\na white ground, and thus simplified matters. Since then we have had\r\nprinting telegraphs, and dials, and writing machines, one of which will\r\nbe described presently.\r\n\r\nSubmarine telegraphs were, it is said, first suggested by Salvá in\r\n1797, and Wheatstone, in 1840, declared that it was quite possible to\r\nconnect England and France by wire. Morse and Calt experimented with\r\nsubmarine cables in America, and Lieutenant Siemens first applied\r\ngutta-percha to the wires as an insulator in the Prussian line of\r\ntelegraph across the Rhine. The English laid a wire between Dover and\r\nCalais, which was broken, but successfully relaid. And so on, till in\r\n1857 the great project of the Atlantic cable was broached. We give\r\nillustrations of the cables; the circumstances connected with the\r\nlaying of which, and the enthusiasm over the successful accomplishment\r\nof the task, must be in the memory of all. The readings of the messages\r\nwere shown by delicate galvanometers, the beam of light being reflected\r\nfrom a mirror. This cable was lost, and in 1862 Mr. Field came over to\r\nurge the importance of the submarine cable between this country and\r\nAmerica. The cable was shipped on the _Great Eastern_ in 1865, and\r\nwas 2,186 miles long. It consisted of seven copper wires twisted, and\r\ncovered with gutta-percha. The outside coating consists of ten iron\r\nwires surrounded by manilla yarn. But this cable broke, and a third was\r\nmade and laid in 1866. The old cable was then recovered and spliced.\r\nThere are some two hundred cables now in existence, the last being the\r\nCape cable, laid when the Boer War was engaging our attention. The\r\ntransmitting apparatus of Mr. Varley and Sir W. Thomson has greatly\r\naccelerated the rapidity of messages, and Thomson’s syphon recorder\r\nfarther increased the speed.\r\n\r\nThe following description of a new system is from _Scribner’s Magazine_\r\nfor 1880:—\r\n\r\n“NEW TELEGRAPHIC SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n“A new system of sending and receiving electrical impulses over an\r\ninsulated wire has recently been brought into successful operation,\r\nthat seems to promise not only a radical change in the present methods\r\nof telegraphing, but a material gain in the speed and cost of sending\r\nmessages by wire. It is founded on a union of the so-called “automatic”\r\nand “chemical” systems of telegraphy. The first of these employs a\r\nstrip of paper having, by some mechanical means, a series of small\r\nholes punched in it, the design being to pass the perforated strip\r\nunder a needle, or stylus, in electrical connection with the line. This\r\nstylus, on passing over the paper, opens the circuit, but in passing\r\none of the holes, drops through and closes it,—this alternate making\r\nand breaking of the circuit transmitting the message. The chemical\r\ntelegraph records any electrical impulses sent over a line by staining\r\na strip of prepared paper passing under it. This is founded on the fact\r\nthat electricity has the power of decomposing certain chemicals, and\r\nif paper is soaked in these chemicals and submitted to the action of\r\nelectricity, it will be discoloured wherever the current passes. While\r\nboth of these systems have been used, neither has been able to compete\r\nwith the more simple Morse key and sounder, and it has remained for\r\nthe new system to bring them to a position where they may come into\r\ngeneral use. The new system is a modification and combination of the\r\nautomatic and chemical systems, the transmitting being performed by\r\nmeans of a perforated strip of paper, and the receiving of the message\r\nbeing recorded by the discolouration of chemically prepared paper. The\r\nprocess is entirely mechanical and chemical, the telegraph operator\r\nhaving no direct control over the message, either by sight, sound, or\r\ntouch. The written message is sent to the operating-room, and given\r\nto the person using the perforating machine. This consists of a small\r\nkey-board, with black and white keys, each marked with a letter or\r\nsign, and an ingenious system of levers, operated by the keys, for\r\npunching small holes in a ribbon of paper moving past the side of the\r\nmachine. The machine stands upon a small table, and under it is a\r\ntreadle for giving motion to the feeding apparatus for supplying the\r\npaper to the machine. The operator moves the treadle with his feet, and\r\nat the same time touches each key to spell out the message. In a very\r\nfew seconds the message is imprinted on the ribbon in the form of a\r\ndouble row of small perforations, each group of two holes representing\r\na dash, and each single hole a dot, as in the Morse alphabet. Each\r\nletter is separated from the next by a longer dash, and each word by a\r\nstill longer dash, and each sentence by a dash of indefinite length.\r\nThis spacing of the letters is performed automatically, the spacing of\r\nwords and sentences is performed by the operator. The perforated slip\r\ncontaining the message is then sent to the transmitting machine. This\r\nconsists essentially of a metallic wheel, divided into two sections by\r\nmeans of a thin insulation of hard rubber. One section of the wheel is\r\nconnected with the positive pole of the battery, and the other section\r\nwith the negative pole. A pair of fine metallic brushes, both of which\r\nare connected directly with the line, are suspended above the wheel,\r\nand are arranged so as to press lightly upon the latter, when desired.\r\nWhen resting on the wheel the circuit is closed, and when raised above\r\nit the circuit is broken. The perforated strip is, by a simple piece\r\nof mechanism, made to pass over the face of this wheel and under the\r\nbrushes. While the paper is passing, both brushes are raised from the\r\nwheel, and slide over the paper, and the circuit is broken. On passing\r\na hole, one of the brushes drops through and closes the circuit for\r\nan instant. On passing two or more holes, arranged in a series close\r\ntogether, the brush closes the circuit for a shorter or longer time,\r\naccording to the number of holes, and as the perforations on the\r\npaper are arranged in two rows, alternating from one to the other,\r\nthe brushes are used alternately, and the polarity of the current is\r\ncontinually changed with every impulse sent over the line. No special\r\nskill is required in sending a message, as the operator has only to put\r\nthe perforated strip in the machine and turn a hand-crank, to cause it\r\nto pass rapidly under the brushes, and with a little practice, a young\r\ngirl can send messages at the rate of one thousand words a minute, with\r\nabsolute precision. The receiving apparatus consists essentially of a\r\nsimple piece of mechanism for causing a strip of chemically prepared\r\npaper to pass rapidly under two small needles that are connected with\r\nthe line. As the paper passes the needles, the electricity sent over\r\nthe line from the transmitting machine seeks the earth through the wet\r\npaper and the machine, and in passing discolours the paper, each stain\r\nrepresenting a dot or dash, and the message is printed on the paper in\r\na double row of marks at the same speed with which it was dispatched.\r\nIn practice, a Morse key and sounder is placed at each end of the\r\nline, and on sending a message the transmitting operator calls the\r\nreceiving station, and when the operator at the distant end replies,\r\nboth turn the cranks in their machine swiftly, and the message is\r\nsent and received at an average speed of one thousand words a minute.\r\nThe message received is given to a person using a type-writer, and\r\nat once translated into print and sent out by the messenger boy. It\r\nis found in practice that two operators, one at each end of a single\r\nwire of indefinite length, can keep fifteen operators fully employed\r\nin preparing the messages, and fifteen girls busy in translating and\r\nprinting the messages for delivery. The system is of American origin.”\r\n\r\nOf the hundred and one uses to which electric wires are now\r\nappropriated—of the alarms, fire-calls, clocks, etc.—we need not speak.\r\nWe must pass on to the Writing Machine (fig. 258) before we make\r\nmention of Mr. Edison’s inventions.\r\n\r\nThe Writing Machine is as remarkable for the simplicity of its\r\nmechanism as for the facility and ease with which it can be used. It\r\nwas invented by Remington, the American, whose name is so universally\r\nknown in connection with a repeating rifle. He makes these writing\r\nmachines in his own factory, where he associates them with rifles and\r\nsewing machines—implements for war and peace.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Writing Machine may be easily perceived from the\r\nillustration (fig. 258), which is drawn to scale one-fourth of the\r\nactual size. It comprises a key-board, upon which there are forty-four\r\nkeys or stops, including numbers from 2 to 9, the _i_ and _o_ of the\r\nalphabet serving for numbers 1 and 0, and all the letters of the\r\nalphabet arranged in the manner most convenient for manipulation. There\r\nare also the various accents and stops, with note of interrogation,\r\netc. The flat ruler at the base of the key-board is struck when it is\r\nnecessary to separate one word from another.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the apparatus every letter is attached to a small\r\nhammer, and corresponds to the pressure bestowed upon the notes, which\r\nare disposed in a circle. If A, for example, be touched upon the\r\nkey-board, the hammer will bring A to the centre of the circle, and so\r\nevery letter of the word will be, by such action, brought to the centre\r\nof the circle in succession. The paper upon which the letter is printed\r\nis wound upon a cylinder mounted upon a slide, as seen in the upper\r\nportion of the illustration.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter is pressed down on the key-board the corresponding\r\nhammer strikes against the cylinder, between which and the hammer is\r\na ribbon prepared with a special ink. The letter being in relief like\r\nordinary type is impressed upon the paper. The slide upon which the\r\npaper is mounted is so arranged as to move from right to left exactly\r\na letter-breadth after each impression. Thus as every hammer strikes\r\nat the same spot a regular succession of letters are printed off, the\r\npaper moving with regularity. When the line is filled—that is, when\r\nthe paper has moved across the cylinder—a bell rings, and a handle is\r\nmoved by the operator who is thus warned. The lever moved brings the\r\nslide back again, and a new plain surface is ready to commence upon the\r\ncylinder moving upwards at the same time, and displaying the printed\r\nline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.—Remington’s Writing Machine.]\r\n\r\nIn operating both hands may be employed, but between each word care\r\nshould be taken to press down the flat board at the base of the\r\nkey-board, which has the effect of leaving a space upon the paper.\r\nImmediately the sound of the warning bell is heard the lever at the\r\nright-hand side must be lowered. The word can be finished in the line\r\nfollowing if it be not concluded, the hyphen button being pressed to\r\nindicate the continuation.\r\n\r\nThe paper used must not exceed the width of the cylinder, but it may\r\nbe of any less width, and a post-card or any small sheet of paper\r\nmay be substituted. If the width be thus limited the length may be\r\nindefinite, and a very long line of paper may be used if desirable.\r\nThe cylinder being made of gutta-percha offers a soft surface to the\r\nimpression of the hammer, and causes the letter to assume greater\r\ndistinctness.\r\n\r\nThe inked ribbon which passes underneath the paper is so arranged that\r\nno two successive letters strike it on the same place. It moves from\r\nan ink reservoir on the right to another on the opposite side, and it\r\ncan be made to return beneath the paper, thus keeping up the supply.\r\nThe impression being made in copying ink, the message or letter when\r\nfinished can easily be reproduced in an ordinary press. The characters\r\nare all “capitals.”\r\n\r\nAt first it may be found a slow means of writing, and the manipulator\r\nmay imagine he can do better without it. But if the author be certain\r\nof what he intends to say, after a little practice at the instrument,\r\nand when he becomes accustomed to the positions of the various letters,\r\netc., the rate at which words can be printed off will far exceed that\r\nat which even rapid writers can work. A young English lady after some\r\ndays’ practice was able to write as many as ninety words a minute\r\nwith this machine—a rate more than double the average writing rate of\r\npenmanship. When such a rate or an approximation to it can be attained,\r\nthose who are quick in their ideas will find the machine a great saving\r\nof time, and for any one afflicted with “writer’s cramp” the gain must\r\nbe enormous. We need not insist upon the advantages the adaptation of\r\nthe apparatus would confer upon editors and readers of MSS. too often\r\nbadly written, and to compositors the invention is a great boon.\r\n\r\nFinally, the working of the machine could be entrusted to the blind,\r\nand by teaching them the form of letters which could be raised upon\r\nthe key-board, those so sadly afflicted could write with facility.\r\nSome methods for teaching the blind to manipulate and to read from the\r\nimpressions of the hammers on the paper have already been tried with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Pen, an invention of the fertile brain of Mr. Edison, is\r\nshown in fig. 259. The “writing” consists of a series of little holes\r\nclose together, made by a fine steel point like a put-crayon. This\r\npoint is thrust in and out with great rapidity, and passes quickly over\r\nthe paper. If the characters cannot be formed so quickly as with an\r\nordinary pen, the writing is very distinct.\r\n\r\nThe alternative movement is given to the pen by an electric motor at\r\nonce simple and ingenious, which is placed on the top of the penholder.\r\nThe general appearance of the apparatus will be understood from the cut\r\non next page.\r\n\r\nThe point is the termination of a wire which traverses the penholder,\r\nand the upper extremity of which catches on the motor by an eccentric.\r\nThis eccentric has three teeth or cogs, and it makes sixty revolutions\r\na second, thus producing one hundred and eighty beats in that time.\r\nThe axle carries a plate of soft iron, which acts like the armature\r\nof an electro-magnet, before which it turns with great rapidity, the\r\ncurrent being interrupted twice in every revolution by the commutator.\r\nThe current which moves this little apparatus is furnished by a pile\r\nof two elements in bichromate of potash, according to Mr. Edison’s\r\narrangement, which is considered very successful. Carbon and zinc are\r\nemployed, and when ready for action the battery assumes the appearance\r\nof the cells in the illustration. When the operator wishes to\r\ndiscontinue writing, he simply raises the stem which has the electrodes\r\nattached to it, and the elements are thus preserved for a future time.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the battery could be made to last several\r\ndays without any renewal of the liquid, and the plates will last for\r\nweeks. Thus a very simple arrangement is at our disposal. Let us see\r\nwhat use can be made of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.—Edison’s Electric Pen.]\r\n\r\nWhen we use the electric pen we obtain a great number of small holes\r\nclose to each other. Such hand-writing is not easy to decipher by mere\r\ninspection like ordinary writing. By holding it up to the light it is\r\nmore easy to read, but in both instances reading is not easy, nor does\r\nit come by nature as Dogberry declares. But if we consider the paper as\r\na “negative,” we may obtain a number of positive proofs or copies of\r\nthe writing. To obtain these successfully we must use a press, as shown\r\nin the accompanying illustration (fig. 260).\r\n\r\nThe writing, or negative, is placed upon the cover to the left, where\r\nit is firmly fastened. Upon the body of the press a sheet of white\r\npaper is placed, and when the lid is shut down the negative comes\r\nin contact with the paper. By means of a roller, represented in the\r\nbox, the writing is blackened,—the ink penetrates into all the holes\r\nwhich are upon the paper,—and after the manner of a stencil plate the\r\nimpression will be found upon the paper when the cover is removed.\r\nThe writing will have a curious effect, but practice will speedily\r\nremove all deficiencies. The same negative will serve for a great many\r\nimpressions, quite a thousand having been taken from one. By people\r\naccustomed to such work as many as six proofs a minute may be obtained.\r\nOf course a little practice will be necessary in this, as in every\r\nother case, before a correct or rapid result can be obtained, but there\r\nis no difficulty in the practice.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three other applications of electricity which we must\r\nrefer to; such as the electric stamp, of which we give an illustration,\r\nand a curious method of stopping a horse by electricity. The electric\r\nstamp might be very advantageously employed in our post offices to\r\nobliterate the “Queen’s Head.” The description, with illustration of\r\nthis apparatus, is annexed. (_See_ fig. 261.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.—Duplicating press.]\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the apparatus is a thin platinum wire, so arranged\r\nas to form either a design or an initial; by this the postage stamp\r\ncan be defaced. The stamp being put in communication with the pile,\r\nthe circuit is closed by the pressure of the finger, as shown in the\r\nillustration. The platinum grows heated and carbonises the paper, and\r\nthus proves itself an ineffaceable stamp.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus may easily be used, not only by the post office\r\nauthorities, but by every one who is obliged to deface a certain\r\nnumber of stamps every day, and wishes to do so rapidly and without\r\npossibility of error.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious, if scarcely necessary arrangement for conquering\r\nrestive horses, and frightening them into submission, is shown in\r\nthe illustration (fig. 262). Many means have been tried to stop or\r\nconquer a restive horse, but the most efficacious has been designed by\r\nM. Defoy; and the director of the Paris General Omnibus Company has\r\nexperimented successfully, as we are informed, with the arrangement we\r\nare about to describe. A small magneto-electric machine is contained\r\nin a box beside the driver, within easy and convenient reach of his\r\nhand. The reins contain a wire, one end of which terminates in the\r\nhorse’s bit, and the other in the electro-magnetic apparatus. When\r\nthe electro-magnet is put in action an electric current is generated,\r\nwhich gives the horse a shock in the mouth, and so astonishes him that\r\nhe suddenly stops in his course. If the operator have the humanity\r\nand good sense to unite kindness to the abrupt application of the\r\nelectricity,—which in our opinion should be only used as a last\r\nresource,—no doubt some excellent results may be obtained even with\r\nvicious animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.—The electric stamp.]\r\n\r\nM. Bella, the Director of the Omnibus Company, has reported that the\r\napparatus was tried in his presence and found very successful, and\r\nquite easy of application; and that even the most unruly animals have\r\nbeen subjected by it. On one occasion a most restive animal was thus\r\ntreated on the way to the forge. He had a tremendous objection to be\r\nshod, and made no secret of his dislike. But a gentle application of\r\nthe electric current put quite an opposite complexion upon the matter,\r\nand after a few minutes the animal permitted himself to be patted and\r\ncaressed, and even allowed the smith to feel his legs and inspect his\r\nfeet without making any objection whatever. His shoes were taken off,\r\nand the horse was re-shod without any of the dangerous demonstrations\r\nhitherto indulged in by the animal.\r\n\r\nWe may quote another instance of the efficacy of this method, which is\r\nreported from Paris by M. Camille.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.—Electric apparatus for checking vicious\r\nhorses.]\r\n\r\n“Many experiments have been made upon horses which had been most\r\ndifficult to shoe, and in each case we have succeeded when the electric\r\napparatus has been put in requisition. One horse, in particular,\r\nnothing could subdue. He kicked and bit and jumped about in such\r\na manner as to render all approach impossible. We had recourse at\r\nlength to M. Defoy’s apparatus, and after the first application, and\r\nwithout any great difficulty, we were able to raise the animal’s feet;\r\nbut after a second lesson we were permitted to shoe him without his\r\noffering the slightest resistance. He was completely subdued.”\r\n\r\nM. Defoy recently made the experiment with a very dangerous animal,\r\nwhich he stopped instantaneously in full gallop (_see_ fig. 262).\r\nIt may be remarked that the application of the current is not\r\nsufficiently strong to stop the horse too suddenly. It merely causes\r\na very unpleasant sensation—he is not stupefied nor galvanized by\r\nthe electricity. The narrator has felt the shock applied without\r\ninconvenience, and the conclusion arrived at is, that this method\r\nof employing electricity is far superior to the violent and inhuman\r\ntreatment so often employed to break horses, which renders them\r\nsubsequently sulky and vindictive.\r\n\r\nM. Defoy has completed an electric bit and an _electric stick_ quite\r\nas ingenious as the electric rein. The _modus operandi_ is simple and\r\neffective, the wires being insulated by leather, and terminating at the\r\nextremities of the stick. The current is induced, as before, by a small\r\nmagneto-electric machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Time Ball.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] _Encly. Metrop._\r\n\r\n[16] “Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.”\r\n\r\n[17] Sabine: “The Electric Telegraph.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n THE LOADSTONE—MAGNETIC CURVES—THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE—THE MARINER’S\r\n COMPASS—MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned some of the properties of the loadstone\r\nor magnet; but as we are now about to enter more fully into the\r\nconsiderations of its attributes and of the compass, etc., we will add\r\nsome further interesting particulars.\r\n\r\nAncient writers (Pliny, Homer, and Aristotle) mentioned the existence\r\nof the magnet, and Humboldt refers to the knowledge of it possessed by\r\nthe ancients. Pliny says “the magnet-stone is found in Cantabria,” and\r\nwe have heard of the loadstones that are supposed to support Mahomet’s\r\ncoffin at Medina. The origin of this fable was (probably) owing to the\r\norder given by Ptolemy to his architect, Dinochares. Ptolemy wished\r\nthe roof of a temple at Alexandria to be roofed with the magnet-stone,\r\nso that the own image of his sister, Arsinoe, should remain suspended\r\ntherein. But the death of the king and his architect prevented the\r\nproject from being carried out.\r\n\r\nThe name “magnet” is said to have been derived from a shepherd named\r\nMAGNES, who, when tending his flock on Mount Ida, found that\r\nhis iron crook was attracted to a certain stone; and six hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era Thales wrote respecting amber and the\r\nmagnet; and because they attracted various substances, he supposed they\r\npossessed life and power. They were the germs of the science now so\r\ndeveloped in their applications, and whose full powers we are scarcely\r\nyet acquainted with.\r\n\r\nWe may remark that other bodies besides iron and steel are capable of\r\nmagnetization; nickel and cobalt have the like property. Magnetism,\r\nproperly so called, treats of certain bodies known as MAGNETS,\r\ndescribes the properties they possess, and the influence of magnetic\r\nforce upon other substances. Electricity and magnetism are always\r\nassociated, but practically the force is the same, electricity being\r\nthe current or motive power, so to speak; and it is to Faraday that the\r\nworld is indebted for the discovery of magneto-electricity.\r\n\r\nEpinus’ theory of magnetism was that all bodies possessed a substance\r\nhe termed magnetic fluid, the particles of which repelled each other.\r\nBut while supposed to repel each other, they attracted particles in\r\nother bodies. Thus they attracted iron. Coulomb asserted that there\r\nwere two fluids—a north and south fluid. Ampère’s theory was that\r\nmagnetic bodies are made up of molecules, round which currents are\r\nalways circulating in all directions when non-magnetized, but when\r\nmagnetized the currents all flow in the same direction. The space\r\nthrough which a magnet diffuses its influence was called by Faraday\r\nthe _Magnetic Field_. The lines of _magnetic force_ will be understood\r\nfrom the accompanying illustration (fig. 263). If we cover a magnet\r\nwith a paper and scatter iron filings over it, we shall see the manner\r\nin which the filings arrange themselves. They radiate in curves from\r\nthe poles of the magnet, and are dependent upon its form. If it be a\r\nstraight bar magnet, evenly magnetized, they will turn inward in oval\r\ncurves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.—Lines of magnetic force.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.—Magnetization.]\r\n\r\nThe manner of magnetization has already been mentioned, but here we\r\nwill give further illustrations of the method of _magnetization_. Four\r\nmagnets are used, two being placed with their opposite poles apart,\r\nand upon them is placed the bar of which a magnet is to be made. Two\r\nother magnets separated by a piece of wood are then brought near, and\r\nsubsequently drawn from the centre to the ends of the bar. This is the\r\n_separated touch_ system; the _double touch_ of Mitchell is completed\r\nby moving the upper two magnets from end to end backwards and forwards,\r\nand finally lifting them away from the centre.\r\n\r\nA magnet, then, is a bar of steel endowed with certain properties, such\r\nas attracting iron, etc.; and electro-magnetism is the term applied to\r\nthe production of magnetism by means of electricity, the medium being\r\nthe electro-magnet. To understand the science it will be necessary to\r\nmention Ampère’s theory of magnetism.\r\n\r\nIt was Œrsted who observed that when a magnet is placed within reach of\r\nan electric current and free to move, it sets itself at right angles\r\nto the direction of the current; and Ampère defined the law already\r\nreferred to when treating of the electric current,—viz., “that if a\r\nperson be imagined as placed in the wire so that the current shall pass\r\nthrough him from feet to head, if he turn his face toward the magnetic\r\nneedle the north pole will always be deflected to his left-hand side.”\r\nWhen the current is passed above the needle from south to north poles,\r\nthe deflection is to the west; when from north to south the deflection\r\nis east. When the current is below the needle the contrary is the\r\ncase. Ampère decided that currents circulating in the same direction\r\nattracted each other, and when running in opposite ways they repelled\r\neach other. He supposed currents to circulate within all magnetic\r\nsubstances, and then—that is, when the body is magnetized—these\r\ncurrents flow in planes parallel to each other, and the material which\r\noffers the least resistance to the circulation of these currents\r\nbecomes the most magnetic.\r\n\r\nThe earth being supposed to be an immense magnet has currents\r\ncirculating through it in a direction from east to west; and having the\r\nproperty or power of turning a magnetized bar in a direction similar\r\nto that in which the bar would be turned by a magnet, the earth is\r\nconsidered a magnetic mass. This influence is due to what is called\r\n“terrestrial magnetism.” If we suspend a bar by a thread it will point\r\nin no particular direction, but may be turned towards any side we\r\nplease. But when once the needle is magnetized it will point north and\r\nsouth; or, as we say (but not correctly), the north pole of the magnet\r\npoints to the north of the globe. It is really the south pole that\r\npoints to the north, and the north pole of the magnet points _south_,\r\nas can be proved by suspending the bar over another magnetized bar. So\r\nif the earth be considered a magnet our English terms are inconsistent\r\nwith our theories. Continental writers are more correct.\r\n\r\nThe line of the magnetic needle’s direction, which differs in different\r\nplaces, is called the magnetic meridian, and the amount of its\r\ndivergence from the astronomical meridian is termed its declination or\r\nvariation. When the amount of this variation is known it is allowed\r\nfor, and the needle can be considered as pointing due north and south.\r\n\r\nBut the needle does not assume a position perfectly parallel to the\r\nhorizon. It dips down in different hemispheres. As we approach the\r\nnorth pole the dip or inclination will become greater, and the same\r\neffect is observable at the south pole. Again, there are certain places\r\non the earth where the attraction is so evenly balanced that the needle\r\nis perfectly horizontal. The line uniting these places is the magnetic\r\nequator. This does not coincide with the earth’s equator any more than\r\nthe magnetic poles coincide with the geographical poles of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe declination of the needle varies from the meridian of Greenwich\r\nat different times. If we travel to the west the variation increases\r\nwesterly, and is greatest in the Atlantic. It then decreases; the\r\nneedle points due north in North America. Going still forward the\r\nvariation becomes easterly, increases, and decreases to nothing in\r\nEastern Russia. Thence the variations are westerly. Columbus discovered\r\nthe variation of the compass needle in September 1493. In places where\r\nthe needle is due north and south the lines drawn through them are\r\ntermed lines of no variation.\r\n\r\nThe variation, however, is not always the same in the same place. In\r\nthe year 1580, in London, for instance, the variation was 11° 11´ E.\r\nA little more than one hundred years later London was on the line of\r\nno variation, and now the tendency is westerly. On the other hand,\r\nthere are places where there is no deviation, and Sir John Herschell\r\nsays that West India property has been saved from litigation in\r\nconsequence of the invariability of magnetic declination there, for all\r\nsurveys were made by the compass. Lines of equal variation are called\r\nisogonial; those of equal dip or inclination, isoclinical; and those of\r\nequal intensity, isodynamical.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the magnetic elements are not always the same, and the\r\nvariations of the compass are daily and annually observed with certain\r\ninstruments. What are termed secular variations take place at long\r\nintervals, as the following table will show:—\r\n\r\n  In 1576 the angle of declination in England was 11° 15´ East.\r\n     1622           ”                   ”          6° 12´  ”\r\n     1660           ”                   ”          0°  ”   ”\r\n     1730           ”                   ”         13°     West.\r\n     1760           ”                   ”         19° 30´  ”\r\n     1800           ”                   ”         24° 36´  ”\r\n     1818           ”                   ”         24° 41´  ”\r\n     1850           ”                   ”         22° 29´  ”\r\n     1870           ”                   ”         19° 55´  ”\r\n     1873           ”                   ”         19° 58´  ”\r\n     1879           ”                   ”         19°  7´  ”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1818 therefore the maximum declination was reached in\r\nLondon. In Paris the maximum was arrived at in 1814, and was 22° 34´.\r\nThe rate of decrease is about 8´ a year, but varies in different\r\nperiods, as may be seen. The discovery of the fact that an annual\r\nvariation took place in the angle of declination, is attributable to\r\nCassini, and the diurnal variation was discovered by Graham in 1722.\r\nFrom 8 o’clock in the morning, when the needle is pointing a little\r\nto the east of its “mean position,” it turns towards the west until 1\r\np.m. It then returns towards the east again, and passing westerly again\r\nbetween midnight and three o’clock a.m., settles down till eight a.m.,\r\nwhen it begins afresh. This variation does not apply to all places.\r\n\r\nMagnetic inclination is besides subject to changes. There are also\r\nvariations of magnetic force which occur at very irregular periods,\r\nand cannot be said to follow any laws. These disturbances are called\r\nMagnetic Storms, of which the Aurora Borealis is one result.\r\n\r\nProfessor Faraday in his memorable experiments divided a long list\r\nof different substances into para-magnetic and dia-magnetic bodies.\r\nHe classed them under these two heads, according as they took up a\r\ncertain position parallel or perpendicular to the axial or equatorial\r\nline. This definition of “dia-magnetic” was “a body through which the\r\nlines of magnetic force are passing, and which does not by their action\r\nassume the usual magnetic state of iron or loadstone.” He concluded\r\nthat all bodies were magnetic, and by suspending a great number of\r\nvarious substances he found they placed themselves axially,—that is,\r\nlying between the poles of the magnet, or equatorially,—viz., at right\r\nangles to that line. If the magnets be suspended at each side the same\r\nbodies will assume a position with their longest diameters between the\r\npoles, while others will be repelled by the magnets even if the poles\r\nbe reversed. So those bodies which are attracted and lie in the axial\r\nline are termed para-magnetic; those repelled into the equatorial line\r\nare termed dia-magnetic. In the “Proceedings of the Royal Society for\r\n1846,” Faraday’s account of the various experiments can be studied in\r\ndetail. We can only give a brief _resumé_ of them here; and he showed\r\nthat the motions displayed by dia-magnetic bodies in a magnetic field\r\nare all reducible to one simple law—viz., that the particles of the\r\ndia-magnetic tend to move into the positions of the weakest magnetic\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nHe experimented upon a large number of bodies and gases; he tested\r\ncrystals, metals, liquids, and solids, and proved in whatever state a\r\nbody might be in the effect was the same; whether simple or compound,\r\nit made no difference. Of course in a compound the preponderance of the\r\ndia-magnetic or para-magnetic property would influence the result, and\r\nthe medium in which the body operated on was placed, was a condition\r\nin the experiment. He proved that if a body be suspended in a medium\r\nor surrounded by a medium whose power either way is stronger than the\r\nbody, that body is para-magnetic or dia-magnetic, according as it is\r\nsurrounded by a medium whose power is weaker or stronger than the\r\nbody itself. The arrangement of the bodies is as follows, from the\r\npara-magnetic to the dia-magnetic, bismuth being the most dia-magnetic\r\nof all:—\r\n\r\n  PARA-MAGNETIC METALS.\r\n\r\n  Iron.\r\n  Nickel.\r\n  Cobalt.\r\n  Manganese.\r\n  Chromium.\r\n  Cerium.\r\n  Titanium.\r\n  Palladium.\r\n  Platinum.\r\n  Osmium.\r\n\r\n  DIA-MAGNETIC.\r\n\r\n  Bismuth.\r\n  Antimony.\r\n  Zinc.\r\n  Tin.\r\n  Cadmium.\r\n  Sodium.\r\n  Mercury.\r\n  Lead.\r\n  Silver.\r\n  Copper.\r\n  Gold.\r\n  Arsenic.\r\n  Uranium.\r\n  Rhodium.\r\n  Iridium, etc.\r\n\r\nCommon air was also discovered to have a magnetic action, and hot air\r\nis more dia-magnetic than cold. Oxygen is as para-magnetic in the air\r\nas iron is on the earth, and this, it was considered, may give rise to\r\nmagnetic storms, and account for the declination of the needle.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to consider the Mariner’s Compass. The compass, or\r\nthe mariner’s compass, is so common that it is scarcely necessary to\r\ngive a long description of it. Its history is unknown. The Chinese\r\nseem to have been aware of its usefulness long before the western\r\nnations adopted it. It was about the time of the Crusades that it was\r\nbrought into western prominence, but was not generally known till the\r\nthirteenth century. Chinese writings ascribe to the compass a great\r\nantiquity; they maintain that it was discovered two thousand five\r\nhundred years before the Christian Era, and used for travelling on\r\nland. But, according to other accounts, it was not used at sea till the\r\nyear 300 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese put the south first when speaking of the points of the\r\ncompass, and in the Chinese empire and Thibet west goes likewise before\r\neast. So the imperial edifices in China face the south, and the needle,\r\nin their expression, points south and north—not as we say, north and\r\nsouth. The antiquity of the compass may be inferred from the recorded\r\nfact in Chinese chronicles, written in the second century before the\r\nChristian Era, that nine hundred years previously to the date of the\r\nchronicle the Emperor gave magnetic cars to certain ambassadors to\r\nguide them home in safety. These cars were fitted with a magnetic\r\nneedle which communicated with a figure. Its outstretched hand and\r\nfinger followed the compass-direction, and pointed out the way.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese subsequently (in the twelfth century) suspended the needle\r\nby a thread, and it is said their philosophers at that time noticed\r\nthe variation of the needle. But Columbus first, in 1492, and Cabot,\r\nin 1540, certainly remarked it in Europe. It is to Marco Polo that we\r\nare indebted for the direct introduction of the needle into Europe,\r\nalthough it probably had been in use in the Levant previously, for we\r\nhave seen a quotation by an Arab writer, who, in 1242, described the\r\nneedle as being used at that time on his voyage from Tripoli in Syria\r\nto Alexandria, two years previously.\r\n\r\nFriar Bacon possessed a loadstone, and there are many instances in\r\nwhich it is referred to in ancient writings. The inventor of the\r\ncompass we cannot trace, but no doubt exists as to its being of Chinese\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary compass is shown in the illustration herewith (fig. 265).\r\nIt consists of a magnetized needle, suspended freely, and fixed to a\r\ncircular card, which is divided and subdivided into thirty-two points,\r\nas in the cut. This compass is suspended upon gimbals to keep it in\r\nan upright position when the vessel rolls or plunges. The gimbals\r\nare concentric rings, the compass being fastened to the inner one,\r\nand keeps its position in all weathers. It is then enclosed in the\r\nbinnacle, a glass receptacle. The card moves with the needle which\r\npoints north. There is a dark line (lubber line) which indicates the\r\nship’s course, and when sailing the steersman must keep that line\r\nopposite the compass direction-point which indicates the course. At\r\nnight a lamp is lighted in the binnacle, and the card being transparent\r\nand the points opaque they are easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe magnetism of iron ships has a tendency to disturb the needle, and\r\nmany suggestions have been made and discussed with a view to obviate\r\nthis. To put the compass at the mast-head was one, to surround the\r\ncompass with “counter-irritants” another. But the usual way is to\r\n“swing the ship,” and so adjust the compass. Swinging the ship means\r\nturning her round point by point, and marking the deflection of the\r\nneedle with reference to a certain object. The amount of deflection at\r\neach point is read and noted, and subsequently taken into consideration\r\nwhen sailing.\r\n\r\nThe Azimuth Compass is a mariner’s compass fitted with brass uprights\r\nslit through the centre, through which the heavenly bodies may be\r\nseen. These are the _sights_. The card is divided into _degrees_ and\r\n_quarters_. A fine wire is fixed upon one of the sights, and in the\r\nother slit is a prism to reflect the divisions of the card to the eye.\r\nThe object—the azimuth distance of which it is desirable to know—is\r\nlooked at through the slit, and bisected by the wire. The divisions of\r\nthe scale are at the same time reflected, and the number read gives the\r\nazimuth distance required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.—Compass.]\r\n\r\nThe compass has led us away slightly from our consideration of the\r\nelectro-magnet, but we will now examine it and its effects as briefly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nAn electro-magnet is formed by wrapping a copper wire round a piece\r\nof soft iron shaped like a horse-shoe; the wire should be insulated\r\nwith silk. If the wire be wound round the iron in the same direction,\r\nand a current be merely sent through the coil, it will be found that\r\nthe horse-shoe iron is highly magnetic, but if the current be stopped\r\nthe power is lost. Such magnets will carry weights much heavier than\r\nthemselves, and by careful consideration of certain laws, and with\r\nreference to the number of coils and the strength of the current, these\r\nmagnets will sustain a weight some thousands of times greater than\r\ntheir own weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.—Electro-Magnet.]\r\n\r\nIf we cover a non-magnetic piece of iron with a wire coil, and taking\r\na magnet turn it rapidly beneath the wire-bound iron, so that the\r\nmagnetic poles approach each other alternately, an electrical current\r\nwill be generated in the wire. The electro-magnetic machine is thus\r\nmade; but although strong currents may be generated as a source of\r\nmotive power it is a failure.\r\n\r\nTo Faraday our knowledge of magneto-electricity is due. “He knew” (says\r\nProfessor Tyndall in his interesting work, “Faraday as a Discoverer”)\r\n“that under ordinary circumstances the presence of an electrified body\r\nwas sufficient to excite by induction an unelectrified body. He knew\r\nthat the wire which carried an electric current was an electrified\r\nbody, and still all attempts had failed to make it excite in other\r\nwires a state similar to its own.”\r\n\r\nBut while he was making his experiments on the induction of electric\r\ncurrents he noticed that at the time the current was passing from the\r\nbattery through the coils of wire that no motion was perceptible in\r\nthe galvanometer. But when the circuit was opened, and when it was\r\nclosed, there was a slight motion of the needle in the galvanometer,\r\nbut in different directions. After consideration the philosopher came\r\nto the conclusion “that a battery current through one wire induced a\r\nsimilar current through the other, but for an instant only.”\r\n\r\nŒrsted had already demonstrated that all magnetic effects were\r\nattributable to the attraction and repulsion of electric currents;\r\nand founding his views upon the theory of Ampère, Faraday came to the\r\nconclusion that electricity could be produced from magnetism, or that\r\nthe electric current could be obtained from magnets. This he succeeded\r\nin doing. By inserting a steel magnet about half its length into a\r\ncoil of wire, Faraday induced a current to pass through the wire\r\nin two directions. Thus he proceeded to solve all the mysteries of\r\nmagneto-electricity, and stated that to produce currents it was only\r\nnecessary to “cut appropriately the lines of magnetic force.”\r\n\r\nThe application of the magnet to the machines for electric lighting\r\nwill be shown further on. Very powerful currents are obtained by the\r\ninduction coil; but the currents would not be of practical service were\r\nit not for the apparatus called a Commutator, or key, which reverses\r\nthe connection of the bobbins, and turns the current at every half\r\nrevolution. Just as if a current were being sent across and back over\r\na table, and when the current has reached the end, an instantaneous\r\n_wheel round_, or pivoting of the table, _sends the current on_, in\r\ncontinuation (but on the table all the time), because of the sudden\r\nchange of its position. The back rush being on the table, the movement\r\nof the latter really makes the line continuous, and by quickly breaking\r\nand reversing the current in the commutator, the effect is gained in\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electro-magnets and bobbin, etc. (Clarke’s machine)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n SUNDRY ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES—MR. EDISON’S INVENTIONS—THE ELECTRIC\r\n LIGHT—THE GYROSCOPE—A NEW ELECTROPHORUS—ELECTRIC TOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRO-MOTOGRAPH—although perhaps even yet scarcely\r\ndeveloped—has already proved a very useful invention. The idea of it\r\nfirst occurred to Mr. Edison in 1873, when he was prosecuting some\r\nresearches in chemical telegraphy. “One day,” says Mr. Fox, in his\r\naccount of the invention, “as he sat pondering over his work, he\r\nhappened to take in hand the metallic point through which, as it rested\r\nupon the paper, the current was wont to pass. When again he closed the\r\ncircuit to let the current through the paper, he held the metallic\r\npoint loosely, and unintentionally allowed it to rest upon the paper.\r\nEvery time he moved the metallic strip on the paper the latter became\r\nwonderfully smooth. Edison was determined to find the reason of this,\r\nand he decided that the electricity very much lessened the friction\r\nof the metal on the paper. He made many experiments, and brought the\r\nsubject before the Royal Society in 1874, but nothing came of the idea\r\ntill 1876, when Edison was perfecting his musical telephone.\r\n\r\n“The new appliance is, in fact, the same invention revived and now\r\nperfected by the original inventor, and brought to complete practical\r\nsuccess under the title of the ‘electro-motograph.’ The action of the\r\n‘electro-motograph’ depends on the fact, discovered during former\r\nexperiments, and employed imperfectly in the musical telephone, that\r\nthe friction of moving bodies varies in greater or less degree with\r\ntheir electrical condition. In the electro-motograph a cylinder made\r\nof prepared chalk, and saturated with a strong solution of caustic\r\nalkali, is set upon supports, so that it can be turned upon its axis.\r\nA strip of metal fastened to the mica diaphragm rests on the cylinder,\r\nand is pressed so firmly by its spring upon the cylinder that when\r\nit is turned by means of the handle the friction of the strip on the\r\ncylinder tends to pull the diaphragm out of shape, causing it to bulge\r\ninward as long as the cylinder is in motion. If now, while this motion\r\nof the cylinder is maintained, an electric current passes through the\r\nstrip of metal, and then through the chalk cylinder to earth, the\r\namount of this friction is varied or it is destroyed altogether, and\r\nthe strip slides freely on the cylinder. This was the basis of the\r\nformer invention. The release from friction by a change in electric\r\ncondition in the first instrument failed simply from ignorance of some\r\nslight matters of detail, that in the electro-motograph are corrected\r\nand made practical. In the musical telephone the releasing of the\r\nfrictional resistance by electric action caused the sounding-board\r\nof a guitar to vibrate, and thus set up sonorous vibrations. In the\r\nelectro-motograph the mica disc takes the place of the guitar, and,\r\nby the improved construction of the apparatus, intricate and complex\r\nvibrations, such as are produced in speaking, are reproduced in their\r\noriginal or even in greater volume. When the apparatus is at rest\r\nthe diaphragm is motionless, and electric currents shot through the\r\napparatus produce no effect. In the same manner the mere turning of\r\nthe cylinder without electric action produces no effect, except to\r\npull the diaphragm slightly out of shape. If while the cylinder is\r\nbeing turned an electric impulse arrives, the pull on the diaphragm,\r\ncaused by the friction of the strip on the cylinder, is more or less\r\nreleased, and the diaphragm is free to vibrate or spring back into its\r\noriginal condition. If now, the electric impulses follow one another in\r\nregular order in correspondence with the sonorous vibrations imparted\r\nto the transmitting telephone, the alternate slipping and catching of\r\nthe metal strip on the cylinder will follow in the same order, and\r\nthus the diaphragm will be made to vibrate in unison with the original\r\nvibrations, and thus reproduce the original words. As the mica disc is\r\nmuch larger than the disc of the transmitting instrument, the amplitude\r\nof its swing may be much greater, and consequently it will repeat the\r\nwords with greater power. The electro-motograph is practically an\r\napparatus for transforming electric action received from a distance\r\ninto mechanical work. The amount of electric action has nothing to do\r\nwith the amount of the mechanical work performed, because the movement\r\nof the cylinder is controlled by power independently of the electric\r\naction, the electricity merely releasing this power by destroying the\r\nfriction in greater or less degree. The electric action set up by the\r\nsonorous vibrations at the transmitting end of the line may be very\r\nslight, while the mechanical action at the distant end may be powerful,\r\nand in this manner the amplitude of the vibrations may be increased to\r\nan indefinite extent, and a whisper may reappear as a loud shout.\r\n\r\n“The electro-motograph is not only a solution of the telephone,\r\nmaking it capable of sounds of every quality and pitch and in greatly\r\nincreased volume, but by this conversion of electrical action into\r\nmechanical work at a distance makes it possible to unite the telephone\r\nand phonograph. Telephonic messages by the electro-motograph may\r\nbe impressed upon a self-acting (clock-work) phonograph, the same\r\ncurrent starting and stopping the phonograph after the manner of the\r\nstock-reporting machines, and afterward the phonograph may be made to\r\nrepeat the message impressed upon it.”\r\n\r\n[The above extract, which explains the principle fully, has been\r\ntaken from a long article on the subject which formerly appeared in\r\n_Scribner’s Magazine_.]\r\n\r\nThe uses to which the electro-motograph may be applied are various.\r\nIt can produce mechanical motion even at a distance, and is useful to\r\nlessen friction by machinery; and in this way its service to railways\r\nand other locomotive systems may be estimated. It is a great help to\r\ntelegraphy by increasing the speed of transmission, and can ascertain\r\nthe beatings of the heart of the apparently dead. It amplifies sound in\r\na much greater degree than the microphone, by which even a fly can be\r\nheard moving. In fact, the limit of the usefulness of this wonderful\r\nmachine has not been reached.\r\n\r\nAnother very ingenious apparatus has been developed by Professor Bell.\r\nThis is for the purpose of ascertaining the position of bullets in the\r\nbody. The following is condensed from the _Times_:—\r\n\r\n“Two conductors are used, and the ball completes the circuit. Professor\r\nBell inserts a fine needle in the suspected region. It is connected by\r\nwire with one of the binding screws of a telephone, which the surgeon\r\nholds to his ear; the other binding screw being connected with a\r\nmetallic mass applied to the skin. When the needle point touches the\r\nball, an electric couple is formed, and the current generates the sound\r\nin the telephone. The surgeon may then use his knife with confidence,\r\nguided by the needle. He may make several insertions of the needle if\r\nnecessary without danger, and any pain may be obviated by etherization.\r\nThis simple method (which should prove useful on the field of battle)\r\nwas tried with success with a lead ball introduced into a piece of\r\nbeef. Contact of the needle with bone had no effect, but a very\r\ndistinct sound was heard each time the ball was reached. A modification\r\nconsists in inserting a vibrator in the circuit; this gives a musical\r\nnote in the telephone at each contact of ball and needle. Again, if the\r\ncircuit include a battery, the telephone sounds may be heard by several\r\npersons at once. A sound is heard, in this case, whenever the needle\r\nenters the skin; but, on reaching the ball, it is much intensified,\r\nowing to lessened resistance. A galvanometer may be used in place of\r\nthe telephone.”\r\n\r\nMr. C. Vernon Boys has exhibited and described a very ingenious\r\nnew integrating machine of his invention, and its application as a\r\nmeasurer of the electric energy in the circuit of an electric lamp\r\nor a dynamo-electric motor. Mr. Boys’ mechanical integrator belongs\r\nto the class termed tangent machines, and consists essentially of a\r\nsmall disc or wheel running along the surface of a drum or cylinder.\r\nWhen the wheel runs straight along the drum parallel to its axis\r\nthere is no rotation of the latter, but when the wheel is inclined\r\nto the axis the drum rotates, and the integral is represented by the\r\namount of rotation. Continuous action is secured in giving the drum\r\na reciprocating motion along its axis, so that when the wheel has\r\ntravelled to one end of the cylinder it can travel back again. The\r\nnew integrator is especially adapted for measuring forces which are\r\neither delicate or variable. It is applied by causing the varying\r\nforce to be measured to vary in a corresponding manner the inclination\r\nof the wheel to the axis of the rotating cylinder. In this way it\r\ncan be used to find the work done by a fluid pressure reciprocating\r\nengine, or the energy transmitted by a shaft or belt from one part of\r\na factory to another. By making the wheel very small and light, the\r\nstrength of an electric current may be continuously measured, if the\r\ndisc is inclined by means of the needle of a galvanometer in circuit.\r\nMr. Boys has constructed on the same principle an electric energy\r\nmeter, which integrates the product of the strength of current and\r\nthe difference of potential between two points with respect to time.\r\nIn it the current is passed through a pair of concentric solenoids or\r\ncoils of wire, and in the annular space between these is hung a third\r\nsolenoid, the upper half of which is wound in the opposite direction\r\nto its lower half. By the use of what Mr. Boys calls “induction traps”\r\nof soft iron, the magnetic force is confined to a small portion of\r\nthe suspended solenoid, and by this means the attracting force of\r\nthe fixed solenoids upon it is independent of position. The middle\r\nsolenoid is hung from the end of a balance beam, and its motion is\r\nretarded by a counterweight, which admits of regulating the meter to\r\ngive standard measure as a clock gives standard time. The motion of the\r\nbeam is caused to incline the integrating wheel, and the rotation of\r\nthe cylinder gives the energy expended in foot-pounds by means of an\r\nindicator or diagram, as the case may be. The object in giving an equal\r\nnumber of turns in opposite directions to the suspended solenoid is to\r\nrender the instrument insensible to external magnetic forces.\r\n\r\nWe have, in a former portion of this work, explained the construction\r\nof the telephone and phonograph with other inventions to make sounds\r\naudible at a distance, so we need not repeat the explanations\r\nhere. A brief reference to them will, however, be found in this\r\nchapter, in which the electro-magnet and the methods of lighting by\r\nmagneto-electric machines are treated of. We will proceed to give some\r\nparticulars concerning the electric light before considering the means\r\nby which it is produced, as such an arrangement is more convenient.\r\n\r\nThe light is very easily produced by uniting and then separating the\r\nterminals of a strong battery. The passage of the electric current\r\ninduces intense heat and a most brilliant light. But if this were\r\ncontinued the wires would melt, and therefore some non-fusible\r\nsubstance is placed at the ends of the wires, which will be at once a\r\nconductor and infusible. Now in gas-carbon (the deposited substance\r\nfound in gas retorts) we have a substance suited to these conditions.\r\nThe carbon is heated to an intense brightness, and particles of it are\r\npassed across the arc of flame almost in a state of fusion. Combustion\r\ndoes not actually take place, because it has been proved that the wires\r\nwill give out light under water, and in the vacuum of an air-pump the\r\nlight is even increased, so that had the oxygen of the air any part in\r\nthe production of the light it would not remain unaffected under these\r\nconditions. The heat arising from this Voltaic arc is intense, and\r\neven platinum may be fused with the assistance of the gas carbon. The\r\ncarbon points are of course liable to be worn away, and one side more\r\nthan another. The positive pole is generally more concave than the\r\nother, for it sheds its particles in a greater degree, and is the more\r\nintensely heated. The electric light first appeared in public at the\r\nopera in Paris in 1836, to illustrate a sunrise, but it was not till\r\n1843 that it was experimented upon in the open air. We need not trace\r\nit farther at present, for a full account of its origin, rise, and\r\nprogress is published in a small shilling volume by Messrs. Ward, Lock,\r\n& Co. We will proceed to the methods of bringing out the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.—The Maxim light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.—Mechanism of Maxim’s lamp.]\r\n\r\nThere are various lamps, many of which required a regulator in\r\nconsequence of the wearing away of the carbon points, as already\r\nexplained. We append two illustrations of the Maxim lamp, the invention\r\nof Hiram Maxim, of New York. In both cuts the letters refer to the same\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nIn the first illustration (fig. 267), A and B are the positive and\r\nnegative carbon-holders respectively, and the carbon points are\r\ncontrolled by an armature, which is, in its turn, adjusted by the\r\nscrew, D. When it happens that the magnetic force is reduced\r\nthe spring acts and permits the points to approach again, and the light\r\nis rekindled; the carbons are then locked till required to move. The\r\nsecond illustration (fig. 268) shows a section of the lamp with the\r\nwheel arrangements for controlling the advance of the carbon points as\r\nthey waste away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.—Wallace lamp]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270.—Houston lamp.]\r\n\r\nIn the “Brush” light, which is in use in London, and is fitted for\r\nlarge spaces, the carbon points are held by a regulator side by side,\r\nand they last eight hours without renewal. The power is generated\r\nby an electro-dynamic engine. We give illustrations of the lamps of\r\nWallace and Houston (figs. 269, 270). The current is conveyed through\r\n_b_ and the magnet, _m_. The armature, _a_, separates the electrodes,\r\nand the weakened current is restored by _b_, and the light continues.\r\nThe pillar, _p_, is hollow, with a wire running through it. The\r\npositive electrode is supported by J, the negative by C; V is a button\r\nwhich comes in contact with the lever, T, when the carbon points are\r\nexhausted, and cuts the lamp out of the circuit by passing it direct\r\nthrough mercury cups.\r\n\r\nThe Jablochkoff candle and chandelier are also represented (figs.\r\n271, 272). The candles consist of carbons connected at the top, but\r\notherwise insulated, and fixed in a socket. They do not last very\r\nlong without renewal. The exhibition at the Crystal Palace will be\r\nessentially an Electric Light Exhibition, and all the latest forms can\r\nbe studied there. The great attraction will doubtless be, as at Paris,\r\nthe varied and numerous inventions of Mr. Edison. The early career of\r\nthat American “magician” is now tolerably well known; his tremendous\r\nenergy and application are fully appreciated. With only a few months\r\nschooling all his life he has taken a foremost place in the scientific\r\nworld. In ten years he has invented the phonograph, the electric pen,\r\na system of fast telegraphy, the electro-motograph, the telephone,\r\na tasimeter, and other useful applications of electricity, besides\r\nsolving the problem of electric light for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison’s electric light[18] requires something more than a passing\r\nnotice, and we will therefore endeavour to give a sketch of the general\r\nsubject. Now that the electric light has been made available for\r\ndomestic purposes, and the very simple lamp (consisting of an exhausted\r\nglass globe, two platinum wires, and a piece of charred paper) can be\r\nobtained, people will no doubt soon largely adopt electric lighting\r\nin their houses. The light has found a success at the theatre, in the\r\nstreets, and in the train; there is no reason why it should not be\r\nadopted generally, being more economical and more healthy than gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271. Electric candle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.—Chandelier.]\r\n\r\nIf we sever an electric wire, and bring the ends, tipped with carbon,\r\ninto juxtaposition, we obtain a brilliant light. This is the Voltaic\r\narc we have already mentioned, produced by the incandescence of\r\nfinely-divided matter; it was the first method of illuminating by\r\nelectricity, and was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, who obtained a\r\nvery brilliant light, but at great expense—about a guinea a minute! But\r\nthe Daniell and Grove batteries and generators, and modern improvements\r\nin 1860, brought the use of the electric light into prominence. Faraday\r\nlighted a lighthouse with its assistance.\r\n\r\nBut when the GRAMME GENERATOR was invented the needed impetus\r\nwas applied. The Jablochkoff candles followed, and now we have the\r\nelectric light in full operation. So far we have sketched the history\r\nof illumination by the Voltaic arc, and descriptions of the various\r\napparatus will be found at the end of this chapter. But the method of\r\nlighting with an incandescent solid was introduced in 1845 by Starr\r\nand Peabody, who took out a patent for the use of platinum. Later on\r\nDrs. Draper and Despretz made experiments with platinum and carbon.\r\nThe latter gentleman sealed the carbon in an exhausted globe, and then\r\nintroduced nitrogen in place of the air. But the method died out and\r\nwas forgotten, and in 1873 a medal was actually given by the Academy of\r\nSt. Petersburg for the “discovery” to Messrs. Sawyer and Mann.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Paris was lighted with the electric candles of Jablochkoff.\r\nThis application of electricity stirred up our transatlantic cousins,\r\nand Mr. Edison was requested—backed up by many influential persons—to\r\nmake the investigation whether the light could be produced for domestic\r\npurposes. The celebrated electrician undertook the commission, and\r\ncertainly came unprejudiced to the encounter, for he had not at that\r\ntime even seen an electric light.\r\n\r\nHe perceived at once that “permanence in the lamp and the subdivision\r\nof the light” were the two desiderata. He put the Voltaic arc aside\r\nas unsuitable, and addressed himself to the problem of obtaining the\r\ndesired results from an incandescent solid. The subdivision of the\r\nlight is really an important point, and a comparison between divided\r\nand undivided burners is in favour of the more diffused light in a\r\nnumber of burners. This subdivision Edison worked hard to secure, and,\r\nas it is said of him, “With a steadfast faith in the fulness of nature,\r\na profound conviction that if a new substance were demanded for the\r\ncarrying out of some beneficial project, that substance need only be\r\nsought for, he set to work.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edison found difficulties in his way. One was the apparent\r\nimpossibility of illuminating by means of an incandescent solid, for\r\neven platinum will melt at a heat too low for use. But this apparent\r\nimpossibility was overcome by the inventor’s genius. He, after many\r\ntrials, found that if he raised the platinum to a white heat _in a\r\nvacuum_ he would practically obtain _a new metal_ which would sustain\r\nthe required heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.—Edison’s platinum lamp.]\r\n\r\n“In making an electric lamp without a regulator,” says Mr. Upton,\r\n“two things are essential,—great resistance in the wire, and a small\r\nradiating surface. Mr. Edison sought to combine these two essential\r\nconditions by using a considerable quantity of insulated platinum\r\nwire wound like thread on a spool.” This platinum, as shown in the\r\naccompanying cut (fig. 273), was suspended in a glass bulb _in vacuo_,\r\nthe air contained in it being expelled by electricity, heating it,\r\nand suddenly cooling the platinum, and squeezing out the air by the\r\nprocess. But, after all, the great difficulty of the inventor was to\r\ninsulate his wires so perfectly that they would not meet and become a\r\nconductor. For, to perfect his lamp, this non-conducting principle was\r\na necessity, otherwise the current would flow across instead of going\r\nall along the wires. He had previously made many uses of carbon, which\r\nwe know is infusible. He tried lampblack tar, but it contained air, and\r\nwould not do.\r\n\r\nThread answered his purpose, but was too fragile and uneven in texture.\r\nIt suddenly occurred to him that paper—_charred paper_—cut into a\r\nthread-like form would satisfy all his conditions.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved—the lamp was a fact. But how can paper, so\r\neasily burned, answer? We will endeavour to explain. “A piece of\r\ncharred paper, cut into horse-shoe shape, so delicate that it looked\r\nlike a fine wire firmly clamped to the two ends of the conducting and\r\ndischarging wires, so as to form part of the electric circuit, proved\r\nto be the long-sought combination.”\r\n\r\nWe will now explain the construction of this little lamp, which is\r\nshown in the illustration (fig. 274) one-half of its actual size. The\r\nilluminating is equal to ten or twelve ordinary gas jets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.—Edison’s electric lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the paper is prepared is, like many other very\r\nimportant inventions, extremely simple, and, we may add, almost\r\ncostless. Cardboard will furnish us with the loops, and these\r\n“horseshoes” are placed in layers in an iron box with tissue paper\r\nbetween each. The box is then hermetically sealed, and made red hot.\r\nThe carbonized paper remains till all the air has been got rid of,\r\nand although it will burn freely to ashes in atmospheric air, _in\r\nthe vacuum prepared for it_ it is never consumed. That is the plain\r\nfact—the secret of the Edison lamp.\r\n\r\nA vacuum can now be produced almost perfect. It is of course impossible\r\nto extract every tiny particle of air from the globes, but by the\r\nSprengel pump, in which mercury is employed, excellent vacuums are\r\nobtained. Several very curious phenomena have been observed in\r\nthese vacuums, and the Royal Society has been engaged upon their\r\nconsideration. Another advantage of the vacuum, as applied by Edison,\r\nis that little or no heat is generated. The electricity is all, or very\r\nnearly all, converted into light. Thus the glass globes remain almost\r\nunheated, and are unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe electric current passes along the wire, W, and at a\r\ncertain place marked B, the copper is soldered to a platinum\r\nwire, which enters at C, and so by platinum clamps into the\r\nhorse-shoe, L. The return wire is similarly arranged; the\r\ncarbon is enclosed in a glass bulb, GG, and all the air is\r\nextracted by the pumps; the end is then sealed up by melting it at\r\nF.\r\n\r\nThe world is now in possession of a lamp for household use, and we are\r\nsurprised that it is not more extensively adopted in England. There\r\nare some Swan lamps used in parts of the British Museum, and when we\r\nhave explained the application of the light, and the uses to which the\r\nmotive power can be applied, we shall, we believe, convince the most\r\nconservative gas bill advocate that Edison’s lamp is cheaper, safer,\r\nand far better in illuminating power than gas, if the success of the\r\nelectric lamp can be assured.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell upon the construction of the “pumping station,” for\r\nthat is virtually what the magneto-electric generator is. Several of\r\nthese stations can be established in various parts of the city, and\r\neach station will supply a district with electricity. The wires are\r\nlaid in a tight box along the street, beneath the footpath, or other\r\nconvenient position, and we are informed that the frost rather improves\r\ntheir electrical condition. Here is one advantage over gas.\r\n\r\nFrom the main wires smaller ones enter the houses, and are carried\r\nthrough a “meter” containing a safety valve. There are two wires—a\r\ndistributing wire and a waste—coloured, one red and the other green,\r\nwhich communicate respectively with the main supply and return wires\r\nto the “pumping station” or generator. The electricity is admitted\r\nbetween carbon points and flows round a magnet, the armature of which\r\nis held above it by a spring. If too much force be put on and any\r\ndanger incurred, the magnet will attract the armature, and the current\r\nwill cease. A snap connected by a small wire will then be closed by the\r\nelectricity, and melting from the heat will cut off all the current.\r\nIn ordinary circumstances the electricity passes through regulators\r\n(wire wound on spools) and on to a copper plate, “through a solution\r\nof copper salt.” Thus for every unit of current a certain quantity of\r\ncopper is deposited. A certain standard amount represents five cubic\r\nfeet, and the bills, based on the accumulation of copper, are made out\r\nlike gas bills.\r\n\r\nWhen the lamp is required a small handle is turned, and is instantly\r\nlighted; the reverse motion cuts off the current. “By touching a knob\r\nin the bedroom the whole house can be simultaneously lighted up” if\r\ndesirable. No matches are necessary, as the lamps light themselves.\r\n\r\nBy adding a small electro-motor to the furniture of the house, and\r\nturning a handle, the sewing-machine can be worked by electricity, or\r\nlathes turned; and any business operations, such as lifting by cranes,\r\netc., can be easily carried on.\r\n\r\nThe Swan electric lamps, which, with Mr. Edison’s, were exhibited in\r\nParis, and will be found at Sydenham, give about twelve candle-power\r\nlight. Edison’s lamps are made in two sizes, and vary accordingly.\r\nThe Swan lamps give a very soft light, and are as easily manipulated\r\nas Edison’s. The Siemens system of lighting was also well seen in\r\nParis, and the Faure storage system enables our trains to be lighted\r\ninstantaneously by simply turning a handle. A full description of the\r\n_Faure_ battery was given in the _Times_ by Sir William Thomson, and\r\nin his address to the British Association at York in September last.\r\nHe pointed out that in the accumulators of M. Faure,—which can be seen\r\nat 446, West Strand, London,—by means of a large battery it is quite\r\neasy to draw off electricity and to apply it as Edison proposed to do,\r\nin lighting our houses and do any little service. The electricity thus\r\nstored would be always ready for use, and would be supplied and paid\r\nfor. It can be applied to any purpose, and locomotion by its means\r\nwill ere long become more general. In Paris Dr. Siemens exhibited\r\nhis electric tramway. This was an improvement upon the first Berlin\r\ntramway, for in it the horses frequently received shocks which they\r\nresented. In the later application the current comes from the generator\r\nby metal rods carried above the heads of the passengers alongside the\r\nline. Little rollers upon these are united with an electric machine in\r\nthe tram-car. The current is sent along the wires, and reconverted into\r\nmechanical energy in the second machine, turns the wheels of the cars.\r\nIn this way, as the car proceeds, the rollers overhead or alongside the\r\ntrack are kept moving by the car, and the connection is never broken.\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression. The electric light as applied to lighthouses\r\nwas also exhibited, and any reader desirous to obtain full information\r\nupon the subject of lights and lighthouses will find it in a very\r\npleasantly-written work by Mr. Thomas Stevenson, in which the various\r\nsystems of lighting by electricity and otherwise are fully recounted,\r\nthe conclusion being in favour of electricity, which is employed and\r\nhas been used for years in France and in some English beacons. If its\r\npenetrative power can be finally established,—for some authorities\r\nmaintain that the electric is more easily absorbed by fog than other\r\nlight,—there is no doubt about its being universally adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to watch the uses to which the electric light\r\nis being put. The latest experiment has been made by an Austrian,\r\nDoctor Mikerliez. Almost incredible as it may seem, the interior of the\r\nhuman stomach can now be illuminated by means of a wonderful little\r\ninstrument called the Gastroscope, which is said to be actually in\r\nuse and to have been favourably reported upon by the medical faculty\r\nof Vienna. There is at the end of a jointed flexible tube (which can\r\nbe passed down the gullet) a miniature lamp, far more marvellous and\r\nmysterious than that of Aladdin, in which a strip of platinum is fixed\r\nand connected with fine wires conducting the electricity from a small\r\nbattery. When contact is made, and the “light turned on,” the cavernous\r\ninterior of the stomach is lit up. Still more extraordinary is the\r\nfact that the tube can be made to revolve, and the light reflected\r\nfrom the walls of the stomach and directed to the eye of the observer.\r\nThere is necessarily a bend in the instrument, so that the light has\r\nliterally to turn a corner before it reaches the surgeon’s eye; here\r\nthe inventor’s skill and thorough knowledge of the laws of optics are\r\nbrought into requisition. The reflected rays of light fall upon a sort\r\nof window situated a little above the lantern, and by means of prisms\r\nand a series of lenses, the light is twisted and turned about until it\r\narrives at the eye-piece. No sensation of heat is to be feared, the\r\nlittle lamp being kept constantly cool by a reservoir of water.\r\n\r\nSeveral contrivances have been invented within the last few years for\r\nexamining the interior of the body, but they are very costly; the\r\nGastroscope is likely to render great service to medical science.\r\n\r\nThe term “magneto-electric machine” is given to a collection of parts\r\nof mechanism intended to create or gather together induced electric\r\ncurrents. The invention of the magneto-electric machine was by no\r\nmeans a sudden inspiration, but the gradual result of a series of\r\nexperiments and discoveries, the first of which, dating from 1820,\r\nmay be said to be Œrsted’s observation, that a magnetised needle is\r\ndeflected by the approach of an electric current as well as by that\r\nof a magnet, clearly proving that magnetism and electricity have some\r\nrelation to one another. In the same year Arago discovered that a coil\r\nof insulated wire wound round a core of soft iron, converts it into\r\na powerful magnet (_i.e._, an electro-magnet) when a current passes\r\nthrough the coil. It was in 1830, however, that our countryman Faraday\r\nproved the creation of a current by the action of a magnet on a coil of\r\nwire, and his experiment proved shortly as follows:—If a coil of wire\r\nbe wound on a hollow core, and a permanent bar magnet be introduced\r\ninto the hollow core, whilst introducing it a current may be proved\r\n(by a galvanometer), to be induced in the coil flowing in a certain\r\ndirection, A B, which ceases as soon as the magnet is at rest in the\r\ncentre of coil. On the withdrawal of the magnet a second current is\r\ninduced flowing in the opposite direction, B A. Therefore it is clear\r\nthat if a magnet be incessantly approached to and withdrawn from a coil\r\nof wire a constant succession of currents will be produced, and if a\r\ncharged coil (_i.e._, a coil connected with the poles of a voltaic\r\nbattery) take the place of the magnet a precisely similar result\r\nwill be obtained. Now it will have been noticed that two opposite\r\ncurrents are constantly being formed, and as the object is to obtain a\r\ncontinuous flow of electricity in _one given direction_, or, in fact,\r\ndivert or reverse the current instantly on its formation to make it\r\npractically the same current, for this purpose a commutator is used,\r\nand as for most purposes a commutator is one of the essentials of a\r\nmagneto-electric machine, we will here give a description thereof.\r\n(_See_ fig. 275.) The machine is composed of a cylinder, consisting of\r\ntwo metallic conducting halves, separated by a non-conducting layer.\r\nWhilst it is at rest the alternating currents, from being connected\r\nwith the halves by the current, will pass to the two contact springs,\r\nand thence through the circuit. Now if (as is the case) the current\r\nis constantly changing, as has been noticed, the inverse current will\r\nat the first change pass through the same channels, but in another\r\ndirection; but if at the instant of the reversal of the current the\r\ncylinder be revolved, the current flowing the reverse way will be\r\nguided through other channels respectively, instead of the original\r\nchannels, and the direction of the current being changed at the same\r\nmoment as the current itself, the two inversions neutralize themselves,\r\nand one constant current is produced. In a magneto-electric machine\r\nthe commutator revolves identically with the magnet or armature, and\r\nthe point at which sparks are being constantly produced is where\r\nthe contact is being continually broken and made by the passage of\r\nthe friction springs from over the non-conducting layer. The first\r\nmachine formed on the basis of Faraday’s experiments was Pixii’s. It\r\nwas composed of two uprights and a cross bar, to which is attached,\r\nhanging poles downwards, an electro-magnet; underneath this, the\r\npoles upwards, revolves a magnet. The commutator is fixed on the same\r\naxle and revolves with the permanent magnet. Saxton, and subsequently\r\nClarke, made the obvious improvement of making the magnet less cumbrous\r\nand fixed, and causing the bobbins of the electro-magnet to revolve\r\nbefore or rather beside its poles; the commutator was fixed at the end\r\nof the axle on which the revolving bobbins (or armature) are fixed.\r\nNiaudat formed a compound Clarke machine, by setting two horse-shoe\r\nmagnets a short distance apart. The armature revolves between them,\r\nand consists of twelve coils set between two plates; the coils are set\r\nalternately and connected,—_i.e._, the poles of the electro-magnets\r\nare set beside one another,—N. to S., S. to N., and so on, so that the\r\nN. pole receding produces a current; _but_ the N. pole receding makes\r\nthe S. pole approach, and produces another current, A B; in fact, a\r\ncontinuation of the same, for the _approach_ of a N. pole naturally\r\nproduces the same current as the recession of a S. pole; then as the\r\nS. pole in turn recedes it produces an inverse current, B A, which is\r\nin turn kept up by the approach of the next N. pole, and so on. Each\r\ncoil is attached to a radiating metal bar, which conveys the current to\r\nbe redirected to the commutator, which is affixed to the axle of the\r\nrevolving armature as in Clarke’s machine. In 1854 Siemens completed\r\nhis machine, the chief peculiarity of which was its cylindrical bobbin;\r\nthe core is grooved deeply, parallel with its axis, and the wire is\r\nwound on cylindrically and covered with plates of brass; one end of\r\nthe coil is fixed to the metal axis, the other to an insulated ferule\r\nat the end of the axis, where is also situate the commutator. This\r\narmature revolves between the poles by which it is closely embraced.\r\nOne of the most celebrated of the magneto-electrical machines is that\r\nknown as the “Alliance,” invented by Nollet, and perfected by Van\r\nMalderen. It is composed of four or six bronze discs, revolving on an\r\naxle, round the external circumference of each of which are set sixteen\r\nbobbins. This rotating compound armature revolves between four to six\r\nsets of horse-shoe magnets, which, being fixed radially to the centre,\r\npresent in each set sixteen poles to the sixteen bobbins. It will be\r\nreadily understood that this immense quantity of poles and bobbins\r\nproduces a highly concentrated current, the ends of which proceed from\r\nthe axle and an insulated ferule at its extremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.—The Wallace Machine.]\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Mr. Holmes perfected his machine, which differs from all\r\nprevious ones (except Pixii’s), in that the electro-magnets revolve in\r\nfront of the coils instead of _vice versâ_; and besides magnetising\r\nhis electro-magnets with part of the self-produced electricity, his\r\nbobbins are so disposed as to be able to keep several independent\r\nlights going at once. The Wylde machine consists, as it were, of two\r\nSiemens machines, one on the top of the other, the lower and larger\r\nof which is worked by an electro-magnet, which is magnetised by the\r\naction of the upper or smaller one, consisting in the ordinary way of\r\na permanent magnet apparatus, which is termed “the exciting machine.”\r\nThe longitudinal bobbin revolved between these permanent poles produces\r\nalternating currents, which are commutated (or redirected), and\r\npass to work the larger and lower electro-magnet, which is composed\r\nof two large sheets of iron connected by a plate (on which stands\r\nthe exciter). Its poles are two masses of iron separated by a layer\r\nof copper, and in this armature revolves the larger longitudinal\r\nbobbin. This lower machine is called the generator. Both bobbins\r\nare simultaneously revolved, and an intense current of electricity\r\nis thereby generated. Almost simultaneously with this one Mr. Ladd\r\ninvented his machine, which is distinguished from all hitherto\r\ndescribed by being composed of two parallel _bar_ electro-magnets,\r\nbetween the extremities of which are placed two Siemens armatures, one\r\nsmaller than the other; both being revolved, the smaller excites the\r\nelectro-magnets, and the larger generates the electricity required.\r\nThe wire is wound round the magnets so that the N. and S. poles face\r\neach other at each end. The chief advantage of the Ladd machine is the\r\nconversion of dynamic force into electricity, there always being just\r\nsufficient magnetism in an iron bar (by induction from terrestrial\r\nmagnetism and other causes) to produce a very feeble current in the\r\nSiemens bobbin, and the bobbin taking it up and returning it to the\r\nelectro-magnet, and the electro-magnet at once giving it back to the\r\nbobbin, the current gradually increases till the maximum is reached.\r\nAnd when we take into consideration this modicum of utilisable\r\nterrestrial magnetism, we may truly say in the words of M. Hippolyte\r\nFontaine, “The mind is lost in contemplation of the succession of\r\ndiscoveries completing one another, and showing that with apparatus of\r\nsmall dimensions an infinite source of electricity could be produced\r\nif matter could withstand infinite velocities.” The Lontin machine,\r\nwhich supplied the current for the electric light which used to make\r\nnight bright outside the Gaiety, is also composed of two parts, one\r\ndividing, the other generating the electricity produced. The principle\r\nof the dividing machine is somewhat similar to the alliance, excepting\r\nthat a number of electro-magnets arranged radially round a core,\r\nrevolve close to a corresponding number of bobbins fixed inside an iron\r\ncylinder, outside which is the collecting and dividing apparatus. The\r\nMaxim machine is constructed on the principle of sets of coils rotating\r\nbetween powerful electro-magnets. The Wallace machine was invented by\r\nthe inventor of the Wallace-Farmer lamp. It consists of two horse-shoe\r\nelectro-magnets placed side by side, the opposing poles facing each\r\nother. Each magnet has a rotating armature of twenty-five bobbins,\r\non which the wire is wound quadruply, and the current generated by\r\nthese coils is conducted away, passing through and exciting the\r\nelectro-magnets, thus utilizing the residual and terrestrial magnetism\r\nbefore mentioned in connection with the Ladd machine; otherwise it\r\npartakes of the nature of the Niaudet machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.—The Gramme Machine.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to what is perhaps the most perfect magneto-electric\r\nmachine, which was first constructed by M. Gramme, a Parisian, in 1872,\r\nand differs in principle and construction from all those hitherto\r\nnoticed. Its essential characteristic is a soft iron ring, round which\r\nis coiled one single continuous wire (_i.e._, the two ends are joined).\r\nRound the exterior surface of the wire coil a band is bared, and on\r\nthis bared part two friction springs act. If the ring and coil be\r\nplaced before the poles of a magnet, the ring will have two poles, S.\r\nand N., induced opposite the opposing poles N. and S. of the magnet;\r\nand if the ring revolve the poles will remain stationary, and as the\r\ncoil revolves each coil of the wire will pass this induced pole, and\r\nas naturally half the coil will be inducted with one current, the\r\nother half (acted on by the other pole) will be charged with another\r\nor opposite current, which two kinds of electricity are carried away\r\nby the friction springs before mentioned. In the machine, as actually\r\nconstructed, the soft iron ring is composed like the magnet or wire\r\nbundle of an induction coil, and the coils are set upon it side by\r\nside. Inside the ring are radially set insulated pieces, to each of\r\nwhich is attached the issuing end of one and the entering end of\r\nanother bobbin; these answer the same purpose as the denudation of the\r\nexternal layer of wire. These pieces are bent so as to come out of the\r\ncentre of the ring at right angles, and lay side by side (insulated)\r\nround a small cylinder. These, as they revolve, are touched by friction\r\nsprings, which draw off the electricity induced in the coils in one\r\ncontinuous current. No sparks are produced at the contact of the\r\nfriction springs, and there is no tendency to become heated. To obviate\r\nthe inconvenience of the secondary or inverted current produced by\r\nthe stopping of the machine, the inventor has contrived a circuit\r\nbreaker on the principle of the electro-magnet, the magnets holding\r\nthe circuit breaker in contact so long as the machine is working; but\r\nthe decrease of velocity lessening the attractive power of the magnet,\r\nthe circuit breaker opens by its own weight (or a counter-weight), and\r\nall danger of a reverse current is obviated. Experimental machines are\r\nmanufactured by Bréquet & Cie (Paris), composed of Jamin’s magnets, and\r\nturned with a handle, and produce a force of eight Bunsen cells.\r\n\r\nA great revolution, or rather the beginning of a new era in the history\r\nof electricity, may be said to have commenced with the perfection of M.\r\nFaure’s accumulators. These are troughs containing eleven lead plates,\r\neach coated with oxide of lead and wrapped in felt, the fluid being\r\ndilute sulphuric acid. The application of them to the electric light is\r\none of their most valuable features; at the depôt in the Strand, where\r\nthey may be seen at work, there are thirty such elements, each weighing\r\nabout 50 lbs. It takes a two-horse-power engine working an Edison or\r\nGramme machine six to eight hours to charge them, and when charged they\r\nwill keep almost any number of lamps of sixteen-candle-power going some\r\neight hours. They are used on the Brighton and South Coast Railway,\r\nand seem peculiarly adapted to lighting by incandescence, by Swan, or\r\nEdison’s lamp. The elements fully charged may be carried any distance\r\nwithout losing their electric power. And the stored force may be used\r\nfor charging the accumulators themselves afresh from the machine. These\r\naccumulators may be seen any day at 446, Strand, and are well worth a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThe Gyroscope, though now an instrument common and familiar to all\r\nstudents, is none the less the subject of a problem, the solution\r\nof which is still to seek. It has indeed been entitled the paradox\r\nof mechanics; for though it depends on gravitation, gravitation yet\r\nappears indifferent to it. In order to render the operation of the\r\nGyroscope as continuous as possible, so as to facilitate the profound\r\nstudy of its working, and also to unite another influence with those of\r\nthe ordinary Gyroscope, producing phenomena of which this instrument\r\naffords us the spectacle, a learned American has employed electricity\r\nas a motive power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.—The Gyroscope.]\r\n\r\nThe Gyroscope, shown in fig. 277, has a large, heavy pedestal, with a\r\npointed column, which supports the instrument itself. The frame, of\r\nwhich the electro-magnets form a part, is connected with a rod, having\r\nat one end a hollow cavity which rests on the point of the vertical\r\ncolumn. One of the extremities of the magnetic spool is attached to\r\nthis cavity, the other end communicating with the bar which unites\r\nthe two magnets. Over this bar is a spring which breaks the current,\r\nsupported by an insulator in hard india-rubber; it is adjusted so that\r\nit touches a small cylinder on the axis of the wheel twice during every\r\nrotation of the latter. The wheel’s plane of rotation is at right\r\nangles with the magnets, and it carries an armature of soft iron, which\r\nrotates close to the magnet without touching it. The armature is so\r\nplaced in relation to the surface of contact with the cylinder that\r\nbreaks the current, that twice during each rotation, as the armature\r\napproaches the magnets, it is attracted; but immediately afterwards,\r\nas the armature comes directly in front of the magnets, the current\r\nis broken, and the acquired impulsion is sufficient to move the wheel\r\nuntil the armature comes again under the influence of the magnet. The\r\nspring which interrupts the current is connected with a thin copper\r\nwire, which stretches back as far as the point of the column, entwining\r\nit several times to render it flexible, finally bending down and\r\nplunging into some mercury enclosed in a round vulcanite cup placed on\r\nthe column near the pedestal. The pedestal also bears two small stakes\r\nfor receiving the wires of the battery, one connected with the column,\r\nand the other communicating by a small wire with the mercury contained\r\nin the vulcanite vessel. The magnets, the wheel, and all the connected\r\nparts can move in any direction round the point of the column. When\r\ntwo large Bunsen cells, or four small ones, are connected with the\r\nGyroscope, the wheel turns with great rapidity, and allowing the\r\nmagnets to operate, it not only sustains itself, but also the magnets\r\nand the other objects which are between it and the point of the column\r\nin opposition to the laws of gravitation. The wheel, besides turning\r\nrapidly round its axis, also effects a slow rotation round the column\r\nin the direction of the movement experienced by the _lower part_ of the\r\nwheel. By placing the arm and the counterpoise of the machine as shown\r\nin fig. 277, so that the wheel and the magnets balance exactly on the\r\npointed column, the whole machine rests stationary; but if we give the\r\npreponderance to the wheel and the magnets, the apparatus begins to\r\nrotate in a direction contrary to or following that of the _upper part_\r\nof the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe Gyroscope exemplifies very clearly the persistence with which a\r\nbody undergoing a movement of rotation maintains itself in the plane of\r\nits rotation in spite of gravitation. It shows also the result of the\r\ncombined action of two forces tending to produce rotations round two\r\naxes which are separate, but situated in the same plane. The rotation\r\nof the wheel round its axis, produced, in the present instance, by\r\nthe electro-magnet, and the tendency of the wheel to fall or turn in\r\na vertical plane, parallel to its axis, produce, as a result, the\r\nrotation of the entire instrument round a new axis which coincides with\r\nthe column.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEIFFER’S ELECTROPHORUS.\r\n\r\nIt will now perhaps interest our readers to describe a charming little\r\nplaything which is a great favourite with children, and which has the\r\nincontestable merit of early initiating them into all the principal\r\nphenomena of the statics of electricity, and teaching them the science\r\nof physics in an amusing form.\r\n\r\nIt is a small electrophorus invented by M. J. Peiffer, and reduced\r\nto such a point of simplicity, that it consists merely of a thin\r\nplate of ebonite, about the size of a large sheet of letter paper.\r\nThe tinned wooden disc of the electrophorus which is found described\r\nin most treatises on physics, is replaced by a small sheet of tin,\r\nabout the size of a playing-card, fastened on to the surface of the\r\nebonite. The ebonite electrophorus produces electricity with remarkable\r\nfacility. It must be placed flat on a wooden table, and thoroughly\r\nrubbed with the hand; if it is then lifted, and the sheet of tin\r\nlightly touched, a spark is elicited from ¼ inch to ½ inch in\r\nlength. The electrophorus is completed by the addition of a number\r\nof small accessories in the shape of small dolls made of elder-wood,\r\nwhich exhibit in a very amusing manner the phenomena of attraction and\r\nrepulsion. After the board has been charged with electricity, place the\r\nthree little figures on the sheet of tin, and lift up the apparatus,\r\nso as to isolate it from any support. You will then see one little doll\r\nextending its arms, another with its silky hair standing on end, and a\r\nthird, lighter than the others, leaping like a clown, and displacing as\r\nhe does so the two small balls of elder-wood which have been placed on\r\neach side of him. We have given an illustration of the three figures\r\nperforming at once (fig. 278), but they are generally used separately.\r\nM. Peiffer has indeed collected every known accessory for an electric\r\nmachine, such as Geissler’s tube, the electric carillon, etc. These\r\ndifferent experiments are all reduced to their simplest form, and, with\r\ntheir appliances, are all contained in a cardboard box. They are placed\r\nbeside the electrophorus, which thus takes the place of an unwieldy\r\nelectric machine. M. J. Peiffer accompanies this little portable\r\ncabinet with an exhaustive pamphlet, which is a valuable guide to the\r\nyoung physicist in studying the first principles of electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.—M. J. Peiffer’s electrophorus with dolls.]\r\n\r\n“It is easy to discover in the education of children,” says M.\r\nPeiffer in his preface, “how to turn their budding faculties to the\r\nbest account. Would you utilize them in a satisfactory manner?—Then\r\nput in their hands playthings which, in an attractive form, serve to\r\nfamiliarize them at an early age with those sciences, a knowledge of\r\nwhich will be at a later period absolutely indispensable to them; and\r\nthey will be much more amused than with ordinary commonplace toys.”\r\n\r\nThese are sensible words, in which we heartily concur. Yes! Science\r\nproperly taught, and properly understood, can indeed be brought within\r\nthe range of children; it should give a lasting interest to all\r\namusements, and form a part of the culture of the youthful mind, as at\r\na later period it will contribute to the perfect development of the\r\ngrown man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC FISH.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious physicist, M. de. Combettes, who is a civil engineer at\r\nParis, has devoted himself to constructing a number of playthings and\r\nscientific appliances for young people, among which we will describe\r\nthe very curious one represented in fig. 279. A jar is filled with\r\nwater, holding in suspension some fish made of tin, similar to those\r\nwhich children put in water and attract with a magnet. In this case,\r\nhowever, the mechanism is hidden, and the operator can turn the fish\r\nfirst in one direction and then in the other at pleasure. The secret of\r\nthis experiment is easily explained by examining the illustration (fig.\r\n279). In the wooden stand which supports the jar there is concealed\r\na small electro-magnet which acts on the soft iron contained in the\r\nfloating fish. When the current passes the small magnet turns round and\r\nattracts the little fish swimming in the water. This gyratory movement\r\ncan be changed at pleasure by means of a regulator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.—Experiment of magic fish set in motion by\r\nelectricity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.—An electric toy.]\r\n\r\nWe will give an illustration of a few electric toys which M. Trouvé\r\nhas found for us. In the picture (fig. 281) we see three different\r\nobjects,—a rabbit beating a small bell, a representation of a bird with\r\noutstretched wings, and a pin surmounted by a skull. All these are\r\ncapable of having movement imparted to them by means of electricity,\r\nalthough made and intended for ordinary use in the form of scarf-pin or\r\nother ornament.\r\n\r\nLet us take the “death’s head” pin first. It is in gold, and enamelled\r\nwith diamond eyes and articulated jaws. The rabbit is also gold, and\r\ncarries two small drumsticks, with which he can play a tiny bell. This\r\ndevice also can be worn as a scarf-pin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.—Magic toys.]\r\n\r\nA conducting wire leads from the pin into the waistcoat pocket, where a\r\nsmall “pile,” about the size of a cigarette, is hidden away. If any one\r\nparticularly admires the scarf-pin, all you have to do is to insinuate\r\nyour fingers into your pocket, and you will, by contact, cause the\r\nelectric current to act upon the pin in your scarf. The death’s head\r\nwill at once begin to roll its eyes and grind its teeth, while the\r\nrabbit, under similar circumstances, will begin to play its bell with\r\nthe greatest energy.\r\n\r\nThe handsome diamond bird represented in the centre of the illustration\r\nbelongs to Madame de Metternich. When any lady wears it in her hair,\r\nshe can, by the concealed wire, make it flap its jewelled wings, and by\r\nso doing cause much surprise amongst the spectators.\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavour to give a description of the manner in which\r\nthese toys play their parts in company with the “hermetic-pile” which\r\nM. Trouvé has applied to many specialities that he has supplied to\r\ndoctors, who use them largely.\r\n\r\nThis pile is formed by a “couple” of carbon and zinc hermetically\r\nenclosed in an ebonite box. The carbon and zinc only occupy one-half\r\nof the case. The liquid occupies the other. The sketch (fig. 280) on\r\npreceding page will explain the apparatus.\r\n\r\nSo long as the case is in its normal position the elements are not\r\nimmersed in the solution, and consequently no electricity is developed.\r\nBut as soon as the figure is placed in a horizontal or leaning position\r\nthe force is generated; on readjusting the box the electric current is\r\ncut off, and all development ceases. Many curious electrical toys can\r\nbe seen in Paris. Dolls are made to talk, and many other wonders for\r\nchildren can be easily procured.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL AND ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding the subject of electricity we must devote a few pages\r\nto the consideration of the electric influence possessed by certain\r\nfishes, and to some of the phenomena of the atmosphere, especially\r\nthunderstorms. We have seen how Galvani experimented upon the limbs of\r\nfrogs, and maintained that they possessed electricity; he attributed\r\nthe current in the muscles to that cause. This theory Volta denied,\r\nbut subsequently Nobili, in 1827, proved the existence of a current\r\nin the frog by means of a Galvanometer. This was conclusive, and the\r\nexperiment was performed in the following manner:—He filled two vessels\r\nwith salt and water, and into one he dipped the crucal muscles of a\r\nfrog, and in the other the lumbar nerves were immersed. By putting\r\nthese vessels in communication with his improved Galvanometer, which\r\nwas extremely sensitive, he perceived a current passing from the feet\r\ntowards the head of the animal.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to Matteucci and Du Bois Reymond that the investigation\r\nof the phenomena of the _courant propre_ are due. The former formed a\r\n“pile” of the thighs of frogs, and by placing the interior and exterior\r\nmuscles in contact he formed a current from the inside to the outside\r\nmuscles. This current is supposed to be occasioned by certain chemical\r\nchanges which are continually taking place, and it continues longer in\r\nthe case of a cold-blooded animal than in a warm-blooded one. There\r\nare many interesting papers on this subject included amongst the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions”; and the “Physical Phenomena of Living\r\nBeings” is fully treated in Matteucci’s lectures on that subject. In\r\nthe “Transactions” for 1848 and subsequent years, other experiments\r\nmay be perused, but space will not permit us to dilate upon them. The\r\nfact has been established, and we are told that muscles and nerves,\r\nas well as certain glands of the body, possess certain electrical\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nThe electricity of fishes, and the power possessed by the torpedo—whose\r\nname is now chiefly known in connection with warlike appliances—and the\r\ngymnotus, have been known for a very long time. This fish, popularly\r\nknown as the electric eel, inhabits the warm fresh-water lakes of\r\nAfrica, Asia, and America. A specimen was exhibited at the Polytechnic\r\nsome years ago. This was the fish experimented on at the Adelaide\r\nGallery by Professor Faraday, who clearly demonstrated the fact that\r\nthe electricity of the animal and the common electricity are identical.\r\nNumerous experiments were made, and the circuit shock and even sparks\r\nwere obtained from the gymnotus. In fact, the gymnotus is a natural\r\nelectric machine. The force of the shock given by the electric eel is\r\nvery great, for Faraday has put on record that a single discharge of\r\nthe eel is equal to fifteen Leyden jars charged as highly as possible.\r\nIts power does not even end there, for having shocked people to that\r\nextent, it was capable of a second and occasionally of a third shock of\r\nless violence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.—Electric eel.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the gymnotus acts is from a regular battery in\r\nthe head, the sides of which are filled with a fluid. These cells are\r\nsomething like a honeycomb in appearance. The shock is quite voluntary\r\non the part of the fish. Sometimes it will kill its prey, on other\r\noccasions it is merely numbed. Professor Faraday on one occasion placed\r\na live fish in the tub with the gymnotus, which curled itself so as to\r\nenclose the unsuspecting one. In a second the prey was struck dead, and\r\nfloated on the water. The gymnotus immediately devoured it, and went in\r\nquest of more. Another, but an injured fish, was then introduced, but\r\nthe electric eel took no trouble about this one. It did not trouble to\r\ngive it a shock, seeing it was disabled, it merely swallowed without\r\nkilling it. It is also on record that on one occasion an electric eel\r\nhad stunned a fish which, before he began to eat it, gave signs of\r\nreturning animation; the eel immediately gave it another shock and\r\nkilled it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.—Large gymnotus.]\r\n\r\nThere were some other curious peculiarities connected with the electric\r\neel. It appears to be quite capable of discriminating between animate\r\nand inanimate touch. For instance, when touched with a glass rod it\r\nat first gave signs of electricity, and discharged a shock at the\r\nattacking party. But on subsequent occasions, when touched with metal\r\nrods or glass, the fish declined to “shock”; nevertheless the Professor\r\nsucceeded the moment he touched the animal with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo is something like the well-known skate; it is sometimes\r\ncalled the electric ray, and is common enough in the Bay of Biscay and\r\nin the Mediterranean Sea. It sometimes pays England a visit, or is\r\ncaught by fishermen and brought in. We have seen one at Plymouth, and a\r\nvery ugly-looking fish it was. Its electric power is considerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.—Ray torpedo.\r\n\r\n_c_, brain; _m_ _e_, spinal chord; _o_, eye; _e_, electric organs; _b_,\r\ngills; _np_, _nl_, nerves; _n_, spinal nerve.]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another fish known as the malapterurus; one species is\r\ncalled the thunder-fish. Professor Wilson has written a paper upon the\r\nelectric fishes as applied to the remedy of disease, and considers them\r\nthe “earliest electric machines ever known.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt relates that the South-American Indians capture the gymnotus\r\nby driving horses into ponds which the electric eels are known to\r\ninhabit. The result is that the fish deliver shock after shock upon the\r\nunfortunate quadrupeds. Mules and horses have frequently been killed by\r\nthese powerful eels, and even Faraday experienced a very great shock\r\nwhen he touched the head and tail of the captive gymnotus with either\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe malapterurus to which we have referred is an inhabitant of the\r\nAfrican rivers, chiefly in the Nile and Senegal. Such a fish has been\r\nknown with others for some hundreds of years; its electrical powers are\r\nnot great. There are one or two other species of fish which possess\r\nelectrical qualities, but none apparently to the same extent as the\r\ntorpedo and the gymnotus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285.—The Malapterurus.]\r\n\r\nThe electricity of plants also is in some cases very marked. Flashes\r\nhave been seen to come from some flowers in hot and dry weather.\r\nCurrents of electricity have been detected, and Wartmann investigated\r\nthe subject closely. He says the currents in flowers are feeble, but in\r\nsucculent fruits and some kinds of grain they are very marked. These\r\ncurrents depend upon the season, and are greatest in the spring,\r\nwhen the plant is bathed in sap. These experiences were confirmed\r\nby Bequerel in 1850, and he concludes that the rank vegetation in\r\nsome parts of the world must exercise considerable influence on the\r\nelectric phenomena of the atmosphere. M. Buff has more recently made\r\nexperiments in this direction, and he examined plants and trees, and\r\neven mushrooms. M. de la Rive, after carefully summing up the various\r\ntheories, comes to the conclusion that it is to chemical reactions that\r\nthe traces of electricity are due.\r\n\r\nThe subject of atmospherical electricity properly belongs to\r\nmeteorology, and under that heading we will treat of it more fully. But\r\nlightning is so identified with electricity, and being the most common\r\nform observable to all, we will say something about thunderstorms and\r\nthe electric discharges accompanying them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.—Benjamin Franklin.]\r\n\r\nBefore Franklin’s ever-memorable experiment with his kite established\r\nthe identity of lightning and electricity, the resemblance between the\r\ntwo discharges had been frequently noticed. The Etruscans pretended\r\nto bring down lightning from heaven, and Tullus Hostilius, when\r\nexperimenting or performing certain “ceremonies,” was killed by the\r\nelectric discharge he desired to attract. But after all, we cannot\r\nattribute any knowledge of electric science to the ancients, although\r\nthey were, of course, familiar with electric phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is to Dr. Wall that testimony points as the first person who\r\nremarked the analogy between the electric spark and lightning. This was\r\nin 1708. Grey and other philosophers supported the theory, but could\r\nnot establish it. To Franklin, who in June 1752 actually brought down\r\nthe lightning by his kite and a key, is the actual discovery due. We\r\nhave already detailed the circumstances (page 206) and need not repeat\r\nthe account of the experiment.\r\n\r\nOf course the American philosopher found numerous imitators, not always\r\nwith impunity. Professor Richmann was killed by the spirit he was\r\ninvoking; Lemounier and Beccaria confirmed the theory that the air was\r\nfull of electricity; while Du Saussure, from his investigations on the\r\nAlps, and Volta from the invention of the pile, are most famous in the\r\nhistory of electricity. They applied themselves with much success to\r\nthe investigation of the electric condition of the atmosphere, of which\r\nthe disturbances called thunderstorms are the result.\r\n\r\nThe amount of electricity varies in the atmosphere at different times\r\nin the day and night. Towards midday and midnight the development is\r\ngenerally greatest, and this fact will account for the prevalence of\r\nstorms during our hours of rest. Again, different kinds of clouds have\r\ndifferent degrees of electricity, and of different kinds. Under certain\r\nconditions these clouds will give forth lightning, and a storm will\r\nbegin. The more clouds the more globules, and therefore in summer,\r\nwhile there is more production of vapour from solutions of salts, etc.,\r\nwe are more likely to have the storms. We are most of us familiar\r\nwith the mass of the “thunder cloud” rising in the distance, light at\r\nthe upper part, very dark below, and throwing out tentacles like the\r\noctopus, coming up sometimes—frequently, indeed—“against the wind,”\r\nimpelled by an upper current, or following the course of a river,\r\nwhich is not unusual. Below, there is perhaps an army of thin dark\r\nclouds. The nature and height of clouds have also a great deal to do\r\nwith the phenomena displayed. In general, storm-clouds are positively\r\nelectrified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.—Cirrus cloud.]\r\n\r\nClouds are good conductors of electricity, and yet they may be so\r\ninsulated by the dry air surrounding them that they will accumulate\r\nit; and when thus charged, if they encounter other clouds charged with\r\nopposite electricity, the opposing masses will attract each other until\r\na discharge takes place. This is what we term lightning, and under\r\nsuch conditions electricity, though very dazzling, is harmless. It is\r\nwhen the cloud comes near to the earth, and a discharge is released,\r\nthat lightning is so dangerous to persons who remain in the fields.\r\nSometimes the discharge comes from the earth to meet that from the\r\ncloud. Sheep are frequently killed by ground lightning, and once, at\r\nMalvern, we had an escape from an upward stroke. The back-stroke from\r\na cloud is also dangerous. It may happen that the cloud has discharged\r\nitself upon the earth many miles away, but a return discharge takes\r\nplace at the other end, and if that end be near the earth the\r\nconsequences may be serious. As a rule, the return stroke is not so\r\nviolent as the first discharge.\r\n\r\nThe colour of lightning varies very much. We have the white, the blue,\r\nthe violet, and red. The colour depends upon the distance and intensity\r\nof the lightning, and the more there is of it the whiter the light. We\r\ncan illustrate the varied hues of the electric “fluid” by passing a\r\nspark through the receiver of an air-pump. If the air be rarefied, or\r\nthere be a vacuum, we shall perceive a blue or violet light. Therefore\r\nwe may conclude that the blue and violet flashes have birth in high\r\nstrata of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.—Cumulus cloud.]\r\n\r\nWe have all heard how dangerous it is to stand under a tree during a\r\nthunderstorm, or rather, we should say, when the storm is approaching\r\nus nearly. The tree is a conductor, and the lightning having no better\r\none at hand will pass through the tree on its way to the earth, and if\r\nwe are standing against the tree we shall be included in the course,\r\nand die from the shock to the nerves while the lightning is passing\r\nthrough us. The best position in a thunderstorm, if we are in the\r\nneighbourhood of trees, is to sit or lie down on the ground some little\r\ndistance from the base of the nearest tree. If the tree be sixty feet\r\nhigh suppose, and we sit fifty feet or less from the trunk, we shall\r\nbe pretty safe, because the lightning will reach the tree top before\r\nit can reach us. We are protected by it as by a conductor, bad though\r\nit be. Standing up in a boat during a storm is not wise. Lightning has\r\nan affinity for water, and besides, if no higher objects are near, our\r\nbody will act as a conductor. Bed is the safest place, as blankets are\r\nnon-conductors. Cellars are not the safest by any means. Lightning may,\r\nand it frequently does, strike the house and descend to the basement.\r\nIf the air be very full of electricity, and a flash be near, a person\r\nrunning away may conduct the lightning to himself by creating a vacuum\r\ninto which the flash may dart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.—Nimbus, or rain cloud.]\r\n\r\nArago classified lightning into three kinds: zig-zag, globular, and\r\nsheet. The first we call forked lightning, and frequently this kind\r\nbranches out at the end, so that although there may be only one flash,\r\nit may strike out in two or three directions at the same time. This may\r\nbe accounted for by the unequal power of the air strata to conduct the\r\nelectricity. The forked flashes are of very great length, extending\r\nfrequently for miles, and the bifurcations also are often miles apart.\r\nThe duration of the flash is less than the thousandth part of a second;\r\nso instantaneous is it that no motion can be perceived even in a most\r\nrapidly-moving wheel, as proved by Professor Wheatstone. We sometimes\r\nfancy that the flash lasts longer, but the impression received by the\r\neye quite accounts for the apparently prolonged sight of the lightning.\r\n\r\nSheet lightning, the faint flashes frequently seen upon the horizon,\r\nare quite harmless. Sheet lightning is that which is seen reflected\r\nbehind clouds or from far-distant storms. It is sometimes very\r\nbeautiful. Ball, or globular lightning, is dangerous, and globes of\r\nfire have been seen to descend, and striking the ground, bound onwards\r\nfor some distance. The descent of these forms of electric discharge\r\nhas given rise to the popular notion of “thunderbolts.” The “Mariner’s\r\nLights,” or St. Elmo’s fire, is frequently observed in ships. It is\r\nusually regarded as a fortunate occurrence. It was noticed by Columbus.\r\nOne voyager describes the phenomena as follows:—“The sky was suddenly\r\ncovered with thick clouds.... There were more than thirty of St. Elmo’s\r\nfires on the ship. One of them occupied the vane of the mainmast. I\r\nsent a sailor to fetch it. When he was aloft he heard a noise like that\r\nwhich is made when moist gunpowder is burned. I ordered him to take off\r\nthe vane. He had scarcely executed this order, when the fire quitted\r\nit and placed itself at the apex of the mainmast, whence it could not\r\npossibly be removed.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.—Thunderstorm.]\r\n\r\nThere have been occasions when the manes and tails of horses, and\r\neven the ears of human beings, have shown a phosphorescent light\r\nwhich emitted a hissing noise. Alpine travellers have noticed similar\r\nphenomena; and Professor Forbes, when crossing the Theodule Pass\r\ninto Italy, heard the hissing sound in his alpenstock. The tips of\r\nrocks and grass points were all hissing too. The party were in the\r\nmidst of an electric cloud. When the Professor turned the point of\r\nhis alpenstock upwards, a vivid flash was emitted, but no thunder\r\nfollowed. They descended as quickly as possible from such a dangerous\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.—St. Elmo’s fire.]\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the properties of lightning and of the electric\r\nspark are identical—the faint crackle of the latter being magnified\r\ninto the loud rolling of the thunder. The disturbance of the atmosphere\r\nis the cause of the loud reverberations, and echoes produced from\r\nclouds tend to intensify and prolong the peal. The sound rises and\r\nfalls, and varies accordingly as the cloud is near or far. A smart\r\nsharp report or rattle denotes the nearness of the lightning, while the\r\ngradual swelling and subsidence, followed, mayhap, by an increasing\r\nvolume of sound, which in its turn dies away, tells us that the danger\r\nis not imminent. The cause o£ this loud rolling, unless it proceeds\r\nfrom echoes from different clouds, has not been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. Sound travels less quickly than light, and therefore we\r\nonly hear the thunder some seconds after we have perceived the flash.\r\nIt is therefore conceivable that we may hear the last reverberations\r\nand its echoes first, and the sound of the first disturbance with its\r\nechoes last of all. Thus there will be distinct sounds. Firstly, the\r\nactual noise we call thunder from the air strata _nearest_ to us;\r\nsecondly, the echoes of that disturbance from the clouds, of course\r\nfainter; then we hear the sound caused by the tearing asunder of the\r\nair particles farthest off, and again the echoes of that disturbance.\r\nThis theory will, we think, account for the swelling peals of thunder,\r\nand the successive loud and fainter reverberations. At any rate, in the\r\nabsence of any other theory, we submit it for consideration. The sound\r\nof thunder is seldom or never heard at a distance greater than fifteen\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nLightning conductors are such every-day objects that no description is\r\nnecessary; but the reason the lightning runs along it harmlessly is\r\nbecause the galvanized iron rod is the best conductor in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Where there is not a good conductor lightning will\r\naccept the next best, and so on, any conductor being better than none.\r\nThe point of the rod cannot contain any electricity, there being no\r\nroom for it, and the “fluid,” as it is termed, runs down to the ground,\r\nto terminate, when possible, in water or charcoal. A great deal of\r\nelectricity is no doubt carried away from the air by the numerous\r\nconductors without any spark passing. Until Sir W. Snow Harris brought\r\nforward his lightning conductors for ships, the loss was great at sea.\r\nBut now we rarely hear of any vessel being disabled by lightning. We\r\nowe to Franklin the idea of the lightning conductor.\r\n\r\nAccording to observations made by Mr. Crosse, the following statement\r\nshows the tendency of the atmosphere, in certain conditions, to\r\nthunderstorms. We may accept the deduction of M. Peltier that grey and\r\nslate-colour clouds are charged with negative, and white, rose-colour,\r\nand orange clouds with positive electricity. The order of arrangement\r\nin the following table places the most likely source of thunderstorms\r\nfirst, and the least likely source at the end, with regular rotation of\r\nintermediate probabilities intervening:—\r\n\r\n  1. Regular thunder clouds.\r\n  2. Driving fog with small rain.\r\n  3. Fall of snow, or hailstorm.\r\n  4. Smart shower on a hot day.\r\n  5. Smart shower on a cold day.\r\n  6. Hot weather after wet days.\r\n  7. Wet weather after dry days.\r\n  8. Clear frosty weather.\r\n  9. Clear warm weather.\r\n  10. Cloudy days.\r\n  11. “Mackerel” sky.\r\n  12. Sultry weather and hazy clouds.\r\n  13. Cold damp night.\r\n  14. Cold, dry north-east winds.\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly touched upon some of the atmospherical phenomena\r\ndirectly attributable to electricity. In our articles upon Meteorology\r\nwe will consider the aurora and many other interesting facts concerning\r\nthe atmosphere, and the effects of sound, heat, and light upon the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.—Lightning conductor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] We are indebted for many facts respecting Mr. Edison’s light in\r\nthis chapter to a paper by Mr. Upton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nAERONAUTICS.\r\n\r\n PRESSURE OF AIR IN BODIES—EARLY ATTEMPTS TO FLY IN THE AIR—DISCOVERY\r\n OF HYDROGEN—THE MONTGOLFIER BALLOONS—FIRST EXPERIMENTS IN PARIS—NOTED\r\n ASCENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this volume we entered into the circumstances of\r\nair pressure, and in the Chemistry section we shall be told about the\r\natmosphere and its constituents. We know that the air around us is\r\ncomposed principally of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, with aqueous\r\nvapour and some carbonic acid. An enormous quantity of carbonic acid\r\nis produced every day, and were it not for the action of vegetation\r\nthe amount produced would speedily set all animal life at rest. But\r\nour friends, the plants, decompose the carbonic acid by assimilating\r\nthe carbon and setting free the oxygen which animals consume. Thus our\r\natmosphere keeps its balance, so to speak. Nothing is lost in nature.\r\n\r\nWe have illustrated the pressure of the atmosphere by the Magdeburg\r\nhemispheres, and we know that the higher we ascend the pressure is\r\nlessened. The weight of the atmosphere is 15 lbs. to the square inch\r\nat sea level. This we have seen in the barometer. Now pressure is\r\nequal. Any body immersed in a liquid suffers pressure, and we remember\r\nArchimedes and the crown. It displaced a certain amount of water when\r\nimmersed. A body in air displaces it just the same. Therefore when any\r\nbody is heavier than the air, it will fall just as a stone will fall in\r\nwater. If it be of equal weight, it will remain balanced in the air,\r\nif lighter it will rise, till it attains a height where the weight of\r\nthe atmosphere and its own are equal; there it will remain till the\r\nconditions are altered. Now we will readily understand why balloons\r\nfloat in the air, and why clouds ascend and descend in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we propose to consider the question of\r\nballooning, and the possibility of flying. We all have been anxious\r\nconcerning the unfortunate balloonist who was lost in the Channel, so\r\nsome details concerning the science generally, with the experiences of\r\nskilled aeronauts, will guide us in our selection of material. We will\r\nfirst give a history of the efforts made by the ancients to fly, and\r\nthis ambition to soar above the earth has not yet died out.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period man appears to have been desirous to study the\r\nart of flying. The old myths of Dædalus and Icarus show us this, and it\r\nis not to be wondered at. When the graceful flight of birds is noticed,\r\nwe feel envious almost that we cannot rise from the earth and sail away\r\nat our pleasure over land and sea. Any one who has watched the flight\r\nof the storks around and above Strasburg will feel desirous to emulate\r\nthat long, swift-sailing flight without apparent motion of wing, and\r\nenvy the accuracy with which the bird hits the point aimed at on the\r\nchimney, however small. It is small wonder that some heathens of old\r\ntime looked upon birds as deities.\r\n\r\nThe earliest flying machine that we can trace is that invented by\r\nArchytas, of Tarentum, B.C. 400. The historian of the “Brazen\r\nAge” tells us how the geometrician, Archytas, made a wooden pigeon\r\nwhich was able to sustain itself in the air for a few minutes, but\r\nit came down to the ground after a short time, notwithstanding the\r\nmysterious “aura spirit” with which it was supposed to be endowed. The\r\ncapability of flying has for centuries been regarded as supernatural.\r\nPutting angels aside, demons are depicted with wings like bats’ wings,\r\nwhile witches, etc., possessed the faculty of flying up chimneys upon\r\nbroomsticks. We even read in childish lore of an old woman who “went up\r\nin a basket” (perhaps a balloon-car), and attained a most astonishing\r\naltitude-an elevation no less than “seventy times as high as the moon!”\r\n\r\nBut to descend to history. It is undoubtedly true that in the time of\r\nNero, Simon Magus attempted to fly from one house to another by means\r\nof some mechanical contrivance, and failing, killed himself. Roger\r\nBacon, the “admirable doctor,” to whom the invention of gunpowder\r\nis generally attributed, had distinct notions of flying by means of\r\nmachines, and “hollow globes,” and “liquid fire.” But he did not\r\nsucceed, nor did many successive attempts succeed any better in\r\nsubsequent years. Bishop Wilkins treated of the art of flying, but\r\nmost, if not all who discussed the subject appear to have been indebted\r\nto Roger Bacon for the idea.\r\n\r\nWhen the nature and pressure of the atmosphere by Torricelli’s\r\nexperiments became better known, Father Lana, a Jesuit priest,\r\nconstructed a flying machine or balloon of curious shape. He proposed\r\nto fix four copper globes, very thin, and about twenty feet in\r\ndiameter, and to these he fastened a boat or car, looking very much\r\nlike a basin. His idea was to empty his great copper globes, and that\r\ntheir buoyancy would then bear the weight of the traveller. But he\r\noverlooked or was ignorant of the effect of the atmospheric pressure,\r\nwhich would have speedily crushed the thin copper globes when empty.\r\nLana’s suggestion was made in 1670, the barometer had been discovered\r\nin 1643.\r\n\r\nThere were some fairly successful experiments made in flying in 1678\r\nand in 1709. The former attempt was made by Besmir, a locksmith of\r\nSable, who raised himself by means of wings up to the top of a house by\r\nleaps, and then succeeded in passing from one house to another lower\r\ndown by supporting himself in the air for a time. He started from an\r\nelevated position, and came down by degrees. Dante, a mathematician,\r\nalso tried to fly, but without great success. He broke his thigh on one\r\noccasion. Laurence de Gusman claimed an invention for flying in 1709,\r\nand petitioned for a “patent,” which was granted by the king’s letter.\r\nThe machine appears to have borne some resemblance to a bird.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1782, however, that the true art of aerial navigation\r\nwas discovered. The knowledge of hydrogen gas possessed by Cavendish\r\nin 1766 no doubt led up to it, and in the year following its discovery\r\nProfessor Black, lecturing in Edinburgh, stated that it was much\r\nlighter than the atmosphere, and that any vessel filled with the\r\ngas would rise in the air. We now come to the invention of the\r\nBALLOON (so called from its shape being similar to a vessel\r\nused in the laboratory) by the Brothers Montgolfier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293.—Montgolfier balloon.]\r\n\r\nStephen and James Montgolfier were paper-makers, and carried on their\r\nbusiness at Annonay, near Lyons, but it was partly by accident that\r\nthe great discovery was made. They had no knowledge of the buoyancy\r\nof hydrogen gas. They took their idea of the balloon (inflated) from\r\nnoticing an ascending column of smoke. It occurred to Stephen that\r\nif a paper bag were filled with smoke it would ascend into the air.\r\nA large bag was made and some paper burnt beneath it in a room. When\r\nthe smoke had filled the bag it was released, and immediately ascended\r\nto the ceiling. Here was the germ of the Montgolfier or heated air\r\nballoon. The experiment was repeated in the open air with even greater\r\nsuccess, and a trial upon a larger scale was immediately determined\r\nupon. A story is related of Mongolfier when prosecuting his researches,\r\nthat a widow whose husband had belonged to the printing firm with whom\r\nMontgolfier was then connected in business, saw the smoke issuing from\r\nthe room in which the little balloon was being filled. She entered, and\r\nwas astonished to see the difficulty experienced by the experimenter\r\nin filling the balloon. It swerved aside, and increased the trouble\r\nhe had to keep it above the chafing dish. Montgolfier was greatly\r\ntroubled, and seeing his disappointment, the widow said, “Why don’t you\r\nfasten the balloon to the chafing dish?” This had not occurred to the\r\nexperimenter, and the idea was a valuable one. That was the secret of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe Montgolfier Brothers determined to exhibit their successful\r\nexperiment, and accordingly on the 5th of June, 1783, a great concourse\r\nassembled to see the wonderful sight. A large canvas or linen balloon\r\nwas made and suspended over a fire of chopped straw. The heated air\r\nquickly filled the balloon, which rose high in the air, and descended\r\nmore than a mile away. This balloon contained 22,000 cubic feet of\r\nheated air, which is lighter than cold air, and of course rising\r\ncarried the globe with it. As soon as the air began to cool the balloon\r\nceased to rise, and as it got colder descended.\r\n\r\nHere was the actual discovery of the science of Aerostatics. The\r\nintelligence of the success achieved soon spread from France to other\r\ncountries. Paris, however, was in advance, and the Brothers Robert\r\napplied hydrogen gas to a balloon which was sent up from the Champ de\r\nMars in August 1783. There was some trouble experienced in filling\r\nit, but when the balloon was at length released it realized all\r\nexpectations by remaining in the air nearly an hour. When at length it\r\nfell it met with a worse fate than it deserved, for the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious peasantry at once destroyed it. After this Montgolfier\r\nexhibited his experiment next time at Versailles in the presence of\r\nthe Court. The first aerial travellers appeared on this occasion—viz.,\r\na sheep, a cock, and a duck, which were secured in the car. They all\r\ndescended in safety, and this success encouraged M. Pilatre de Rozier\r\nto make an attempt in a “fire balloon.” He went up first in a captive\r\nballoon, and at length he and a friend, the Marquis d’Arlandes,\r\nascended from the Bois de Boulogne. The trip was a decided success, and\r\nthe possibility of navigating the air was fully demonstrated.\r\n\r\nSoon after this,—viz., in December 1783,—an Italian Count, named\r\nZambeccari, made an ascent in London, and came down safely at Petworth.\r\nMM. Charles and Robert ascended from Paris in December, and in February\r\na balloon crossed the English Channel. We must pass over some time\r\nand come to the ascents of Lunardi, which caused great excitement in\r\nLondon. His balloon was a very large one, and was inflated, or rather\r\npartially so, at the Artillery ground. Some delay occurred, and fearing\r\na riot, M. Lunardi proposed to go up alone with the partially-filled\r\nballoon. A Mr. Biggin who had intended to ascend was left behind. The\r\nPrince of Wales was present, with thousands of spectators. Lunardi\r\ncast off and ascended rapidly, causing great admiration from the whole\r\nmetropolis. Judge and jury, sovereign and ministers, all turned out\r\nto gaze at the balloon; a guilty prisoner was acquitted hurriedly, so\r\nthat no time was lost in discussion, and one lady died of excitement.\r\nLunardi was regarded as a hero, and made many other ascents. He died in\r\n1806.\r\n\r\nIn those earlier days one or two fatal accidents happened. Count\r\nZambeccari and a companion were in a balloon which caught fire, and\r\nboth occupants of the car leaped from it as they were descending. The\r\nCount was killed on the spot, and his companion was much injured.\r\nPilatre de Rozier made an attempt to cross the channel to England in\r\n1785; he had reached three thousand feet when the balloon caught fire,\r\nand the unfortunate traveller was precipitated to the ground. His\r\nassociate only survived him a few minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294.—MM. Charles’ and Roberts’ balloon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.—Blanchard’s balloon.]\r\n\r\nIt is to the celebrated English aeronaut, Mr. Green, that the\r\nsubstitution of carburetted hydrogen or street gas for hydrogen is due,\r\nand since his ascent in 1821 no other means of inflation have been\r\nused. A great many quite successful and a few unsuccessful ascents\r\nhave been made for pleasure or profit. Mr. Green, in the _Nassau_\r\nballoon, passed over to Nassau, a distance of five hundred miles, in\r\neighteen hours. This exploit was the cause of the name being bestowed\r\nupon the balloon. The _Giant_ of M. Nadar was exhibited in England,\r\nand it was an enormous one, being an hundred feet high, and nearly as\r\nwide in the widest part. But even this machine was outdone by the\r\nGodard “Montgolfier” balloon, which was one hundred and seventeen feet\r\nhigh, and carried a stove. We give illustrations of these celebrated\r\nballoons, and will now pass on to the more scientific portion of the\r\nsubject and the ascents of Mr. Glaisher and other aeronauts for the\r\npurpose of making meteorological observations, and the use of balloons\r\nfor purposes of observation in war.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the first ascent for scientific investigation was made\r\nin the year 1803. The aeronauts were Messrs. Robertson and Lhoest.\r\nThey ascended from Hamburg and came down at Hanover, and made meantime\r\nseveral experiments with reference to the electrical condition of the\r\natmosphere, its influence upon a magnetic needle, and some experiments\r\nwith regard to acoustics and heat. The report was presented to the\r\nSt. Petersburg Academy, and contains the result of their interesting\r\nobservations. The travellers ascertained that at the elevation to which\r\nthey attained,—viz., 25,500 feet,—the temperature was on that July\r\nday fifty degrees colder, falling to 19·6°, while on the earth the\r\nthermometer had shown 68°. They ascertained that glass and wax did not\r\nbecome electric when rubbed, that the Voltaic battery lost much of its\r\npower, that the oscillation of a “dipping needle” increased as they\r\nmounted into the air, while sound was certainly less easily transmitted\r\nat that elevation, and struck them as less powerful in tone. The heat\r\nexperiment was not a success, owing to the breaking of the thermometer.\r\nThey wished to find the temperature of boiling water at that elevation,\r\nbut when the experiment was about to be made Robertson accidentally\r\nplunged the instrument _into the fire_ instead of into the water. So\r\nthe question was not settled.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the aeronauts was a sensation of sleepiness, and two\r\nbirds died. The muscular powers of the voyagers also appear to have\r\nbeen much affected, and similar sensations may be experienced by\r\ntravellers on high mountains who find their breath very short and a\r\ndisinclination to exertion oppress them.\r\n\r\nMM. Biot and Gay-Lussac made a very interesting ascent in 1804. We will\r\ndetail their experiences at some length, for the coolness displayed\r\nand the value of the observations made are remarkable in the history\r\nof scientific ballooning. They started, at 10 o’clock a.m. on the 23rd\r\nof August, and when the balloon had carried them up to an altitude of\r\n8,600 feet they commenced their experiments. They had some animals in\r\nthe car with them, a bee amongst the number, and the insect was let go\r\nfirst. It flew away swiftly, not at all inconvenienced apparently. The\r\nsun was very hot at 56° Fahr. Their pulses were beating very fast, but\r\nno inconvenience was felt.\r\n\r\nWhen 11,000 feet had been reached a linnet was permitted to go at\r\nlarge, but after a little time the bird returned to the balloon. It\r\nremained perched for a few minutes, and then dashed downwards at a\r\ntremendous pace. A pigeon was then liberated. It also appeared very\r\nuncertain, and wheeled around in circles for a time. At last it gained\r\nconfidence, and descended, and disappeared in the clouds beneath.\r\nThey made other experiments, but descended without having obtained as\r\naccurate results as had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.—The Nassau balloon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.—The “Giant” balloon of M. Nadar.]\r\n\r\nOn the next occasion, however, every care was taken, and on the 15th\r\nof September the important ascent was made by Gay-Lussac alone. He\r\nfixed hanging ropes to the balloon with the view to check the rotating\r\nmovements, and having provided himself with all necessary apparatus\r\nand two vacuum flasks to bring down some of the upper air, the young\r\nman started. The barometer marked 30·66\", the thermometer 82° (Fahr.).\r\nAt an elevation of 12,680 feet Lussac perceived that the variation of\r\nthe compass was the same as on land. Two hundred feet higher up he\r\nascertained that a key held in the magnetic direction repelled with\r\nthe lower, and attracted with its upper extremity the north pole of\r\na needle. This experiment was repeated with the same result at an\r\nelevation of 20,000 feet, which shows how the earth exercises its\r\nmagnetic influence. The temperature of the air was found to decrease\r\nin proportion as the ascent up to 12,000 feet, where the reading was\r\n47·3°. It then increased up to 14,000 feet by 6°, and then regularly\r\ndiminished again as the balloon rose, till at the greatest elevation\r\nreached, 23,000 feet, there was a difference of 67° in the temperature\r\non the earth, for at the maximum height attained the thermometer stood\r\nat 14·9°.\r\n\r\nBut the most important fact ascertained, and one which set many\r\ntheories at rest, was the composition of the atmosphere in those high\r\naltitudes. We mentioned that Gay-Lussac took up two empty flasks from\r\nwhich the air had been taken. The vacuum was almost perfect. When\r\nthe aeronaut had reached 21,460 feet he opened one flask, and it was\r\nquickly filled; he secured it carefully; and when at his highest\r\npoint,—four miles and a half above the sea-level,—he opened the\r\nother flask. The barometer stood at 12.95 inches, and the cold was\r\nvery great. The voyager felt benumbed, and experienced difficulty of\r\nbreathing; his throat was parched and dry. So Lussac determined to\r\nreturn, he could go no higher. He dropped gently near Rouen, and soon\r\nreached Paris. As soon as possible the air in the flasks was submitted\r\nto very delicate tests, and to the satisfaction of the scientists\r\nengaged it was found to be in exactly the same proportions as that\r\ncollected near the earth—two hundred and fifteen parts of oxygen to\r\nevery thousand of atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Banal and Bixio, in 1850, also made some observations, and\r\nfound the temperature very variable. At 23,000 feet they found the\r\nthermometer at _minus_ 38·2° Fahr., which was much below the cold\r\nexperienced by Gay-Lussac. We may still conclude that the various\r\ncurrents of the atmosphere cause considerable variation, and that it is\r\nimpossible to lay down anything respecting the degrees of heat and cold\r\nlikely to be found at certain elevations. We quote Arago’s observations\r\nupon this ascent:—\r\n\r\n“This discovery” (the ice particles found in the air) “explains how\r\nthese minute crystals may become the nucleus of large hailstones,\r\nfor they may condense round them the aqueous vapour contained in the\r\nportion of the atmosphere where they exist. They go far to prove the\r\ntruth of Mariotte’s theory, according to which these crystals of ice\r\nsuspended in the air are the cause of parahelia—or mock-suns and\r\nmock-moons. Moreover, the great extent of so cold a cloud explains very\r\nsatisfactorily the sudden changes of temperature which occur in our\r\nclimates.”\r\n\r\nM. Flammarion gives in his “Voyages” some very interesting and amusing\r\nparticulars, as well as many valuable scientific observations. During\r\none ascent he remarked that the shadow of the balloon was _white_, and\r\nat another time dark. When white the surface upon which it fell looked\r\nmore luminous than any other part of the country! The phenomenon was\r\nan _anthelion_. The absolute silence impressed the voyager very much.\r\nHe adds, “The silence was so oppressive that we cannot help asking\r\nourselves are we still alive! We appear to appertain no longer to the\r\nworld below.” M. Flammarion’s observations on the colour of what we\r\nterm the sky are worth quoting—not because they are novel, but because\r\nthey put so very clearly before us the appearance we call the “blue\r\nvault.” He says,—speaking of the non-existence of the “celestial\r\nvault,”—“The air reflects the blue rays of the solar spectrum from\r\nevery side. The white light of the sun contains every colour, and the\r\nair allows all tints to pass through it except the blue. This causes\r\nus to suppose the atmosphere is blue. But the air has no such colour,\r\nand the tint in question is merely owing to the reflection of light.\r\nPlanetary space is absolutely black; the higher we rise the thinner the\r\nlayer of atmosphere that separates us from it, and the darker the sky\r\nappears.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.—The “Eagle” of M. Godard.]\r\n\r\nSome beautiful effects may be witnessed at night from a balloon, and\r\nconsidering the few accidents there have been in proportion to the\r\nnumber of ascents, we do not wonder at balloon voyages being undertaken\r\nfor mere pleasure. When science has to be advanced there can be no\r\nobjection made, for then experience goes hand-in-hand with caution.\r\nIt is only the ignorant who are rash; the student of Nature learns to\r\nrespect her, and to attend to her admonitions and warnings in time.\r\nThe details of the ascents of famous aeronauts give us a great deal\r\nof pleasant and profitable reading. The phenomena of the sky and\r\nclouds, and of the heavens, are all studied with great advantage from\r\na balloon, or “aerostat,” as it is the fashion to call it. The grand\r\nphenomena of “Ulloa’s circles,” or _anthelia_, which represent the\r\nballoon in air, and surrounded by a kind of glory, or aureola, like\r\nthose represented behind saintly heads, appear, as the name denotes,\r\nopposite to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe various experiments made to ascertain the intensity of sounds have\r\nresulted in the conclusion that they can be heard at great distances.\r\nFor instance, the steam whistle is distinctly audible 10,000 feet up in\r\nthe air, and human voices are heard at an altitude of 5,000 feet. A\r\nman’s voice alone will penetrate more than 3,000 feet into the air; and\r\nat that elevation the croaking of frogs is quite distinguishable. This\r\nshows that sound ascends with ease, but it meets with great resistance\r\nin its downward course, for the aeronaut cannot make himself audible\r\nto a listener on the earth at a greater distance than 300 or 400 feet,\r\nthough the latter can be distinctly heard at an elevation of 1,600\r\nfeet. The diminution of temperature noted by M. Flammarion is stated\r\nto be 1° Fahr. for every 345 feet on a fine day. On a cloudy day the\r\nmean decrease was 1° for every 354 feet of altitude. The temperature\r\nof clouds is higher than the air surrounding them, and the decrease is\r\nmore rapid near the surface, less rapid as the balloon ascends. We may\r\nadd that at high elevations the cork from a water-bottle will pop out\r\nas if from a champagne flask.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto referred more to M. Flammarion and other French\r\naeronauts, but we must not be considered in any way oblivious of\r\nour countrymen, Messrs. Glaisher, Green, and Coxwell, nor of the\r\nAmerican,—one of the most experienced of aerial voyagers,—Mr. Wise. The\r\nscientific observations made by the French voyagers confirmed generally\r\nMr. Glaisher’s experiments. This noted air-traveller made twenty-eight\r\nascents in the cause of science, and his experiences related in\r\n“Travels in the Air,” and in the “Reports” of the British Association,\r\nare both useful and entertaining. For “Sensational ballooning” one\r\nwishes to go no farther than his account of his experience with Mr.\r\nCoxwell, when (on the 5th of September, 1862) he attained the greatest\r\nelevation ever reached, viz., seven miles, or thirty-seven thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWe condense this exciting narrative for the benefit of those who have\r\nnot seen it already.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was made from Wolverhampton. At 1.39 p.m., the balloon was\r\nfour miles high, the temperature was 8°, and by the time the fifth\r\nmile had been reached the mercury was below zero, and up to this time\r\nobservations had been made without discomfort, though Mr. Coxwell,\r\nhaving exerted himself as aeronaut, found some difficulty in breathing.\r\nAbout 2 o’clock, the balloon still ascending, Mr. Glaisher could not\r\nsee the mercury in the thermometer, and Mr. Coxwell had just then\r\nascended into the ring above the car to release the valve line which\r\nhad become twisted. Mr. Glaisher was able to note the barometer,\r\nhowever, and found it marked 10 inches, and was rapidly decreasing. It\r\nfell to 9¾ inches, and this indicated an elevation of 29,000 feet!\r\nBut the idea was to ascend as high as possible, so the upward direction\r\nwas maintained. “Shortly afterwards,” writes Mr. Glaisher, “I laid my\r\narm upon the table possessed of its full vigour, and on being desirous\r\nof using it I found it powerless,—it must have lost power momentarily.\r\nI tried to move the other arm, and found it powerless also. I then\r\ntried to shake myself, and succeeded in shaking my body. I seemed to\r\nhave no limbs. I then looked at the barometer, and whilst doing so my\r\nhead fell on my left shoulder.”\r\n\r\nMr. Glaisher subsequently quite lost consciousness, and “black\r\ndarkness” came. While powerless he heard Mr. Coxwell speaking, and then\r\nthe words, “Do try, now do.” Then sight slowly returned, and rousing\r\nhimself, Mr. Glaisher said, “I have been insensible.” Mr. Coxwell\r\nreplied, “You have, and I, too, very nearly.” Mr. Coxwell’s hands were\r\nblack, and his companion had to pour brandy upon them. Mr. Coxwell’s\r\nsituation was a perilous one. He had lost the use of his hands,\r\nwhich were frozen, and had to hang by his arms to the ring and drop\r\ninto the car. He then perceived his friend was insensible, and found\r\ninsensibility coming on himself. There was only one course to pursue—to\r\npull the valve line and let the gas escape, so as to descend. But his\r\nhands were powerless! As a last resource he gripped the line with his\r\nteeth, and bending down his head, after many attempts succeeded in\r\nopening the valve and letting the gas escape. The descent was easily\r\nmade, and accomplished in safety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.—A descending balloon.]\r\n\r\nSome pigeons were taken up on this occasion, and were set free at\r\ndifferent altitudes. The first, at three miles, “dropped as a piece of\r\npaper”; the second, at four miles, “flew vigorously round and round,\r\napparently taking a dip each time”; a third, a little later, “fell like\r\na stone.” On descending a fourth was thrown out at four miles, and\r\nafter flying in a circle, “alighted on the top of the balloon.” Of the\r\nremaining pair one was dead when the ground was gained, and the other\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe observations noted are too numerous to be included here. Some,\r\nwe have seen, were confirmed by subsequent aeronauts, and as we have\r\nmentioned them in former pages we need not repeat them. The results\r\ndiffered very much under different conditions, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to decide upon any law. The direction of the wind in the\r\nhigher and lower regions sometimes differed, sometimes was the same,\r\nand so on. The “Reports” of the British Association (1862-1866) will\r\nfurnish full particulars of all Mr. Glaisher’s experiments.\r\n\r\nWe have scarcely space left to mention the parachutes or umbrella-like\r\nballoons which have occasionally been used. Its invention is traced\r\nto very early times; but Garnerin was the first who descended in a\r\nparachute, in 1797, and continued to do so in safety on many subsequent\r\noccasions. The parachute was suspended to a balloon, and at a certain\r\nelevation the voyager let go and came down in safety. He ascended once\r\nfrom London, and let go when 8,000 feet up. The parachute did not\r\nexpand as usual, and fell at a tremendous rate. At length it opened\r\nout, and the occupier of the car came down forcibly, it is true, but\r\nsafely. The form of the parachute is not unlike an umbrella opened,\r\nwith cords attaching the car to the extremities of the “ribs,” the top\r\nof the basket car being fastened to the “stick” of the umbrella.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Cocking invented a novel kind of parachute, but when he\r\nattempted to descend by it from Mr. Green’s balloon it collapsed, and\r\nthe unfortunate voyager was dashed to pieces. His remains were found\r\nnear Lee, in Kent. Mr. Hampton did better on Garnerin’s principle, and\r\nmade several descents in safety and without injury.\r\n\r\nThe problem of flying in the air has attracted the notice of the\r\nAeronautical Society, established in 1873, but so far without leading\r\nto practical results, though many daring and ingenious suggestions have\r\nbeen put forth in the “Reports.”\r\n\r\nIt is not within our province to do more than refer to the uses of\r\nthe balloon for scientific purposes, but we may mention the services\r\nit was employed upon during the French war, 1870-71. The investment\r\nof Paris by the German army necessitated aerial communication, for no\r\nother means were available. Balloon manufactories were established,\r\nand a great number were made, and carried millions of letters to the\r\nprovinces. Carrier-pigeons were used to carry the return messages to\r\nthe city, and photography was applied to bring the correspondence into\r\nthe smallest legible compass. The many adventures of the aeronauts are\r\nwithin the recollection of all. A few of the balloons never reappeared;\r\nsome were carried into Norway, and beyond the French frontier in other\r\ndirections. The average capacity of these balloons was 70,000 cubic\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOf course it will be understood how balloons are enabled to navigate\r\nthe air. The envelope being partly filled with coal-gas-heated air and\r\nhydrogen, is much lighter than the surrounding atmosphere, and rises\r\nto a height according as the density of the air strata diminishes. The\r\ndensity is less as we ascend, and the buoyant force also is lessened\r\nin proportion. So when the weight of the balloon and its occupants is\r\nthe same as the power of buoyancy, it will come to a stand, and go no\r\nhigher. It can also be understood that as the pressure of the outside\r\nbecomes less, the expansive force of the gas within becomes greater.\r\nWe know that gas is very compressible, and yet a little gas will fill\r\na large space. Therefore, as the balloon rises, it retains its rounded\r\nform, and appears full even at great altitudes; but if the upper\r\npart were quite filled before it left the ground, the balloon would\r\ninevitably burst at a certain elevation when the external pressure of\r\nthe air would be removed, unless an escape were provided. This escape\r\nis arranged for by a valve at the top of the balloon, and the lower\r\npart above the car is also left open very often, so that the gas can\r\nescape of itself. When a rapid descent is necessary, the top valve is\r\nopened by means of a rope, and the balloon sinks by its own weight. Mr.\r\nGlaisher advises for great ascensions a balloon of a capacity of 90,000\r\ncubic feet, and only filled one-third of that capacity with gas. Six\r\nhundred pounds of ballast should be taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.—Filling a balloon.]\r\n\r\nA very small quantity of ballast thrown away will make a great\r\ndifference; a handful will raise the balloon many feet, and a chicken\r\nbone cast out occasions a rise of thirty yards. The ballast is carried\r\nin small bags, and consists of dry sand, which speedily dissipates in\r\nthe air as it falls. By throwing out ballast the aeronaut can ascend\r\nto a great height—in fact, as high as he can go, the limit apparently\r\nfor human existence being about seven miles, when cold and rarefied air\r\nwill speedily put an end to existence.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that however rapidly the balloon may be\r\ntravelling through the air, the occupants are not sensible of the\r\nmotion. This, in part, arises from the impossibility of comparing it\r\nwith other objects. We pass nothing stationary which would indicate\r\nthe pace at which we travel. But the absence of oscillation is also\r\nremarkable; even a glass of water may be filled brim-full, and to\r\nsuch a level that the water is above the rim of the glass, and yet\r\nnot a drop will fall. This experiment was made by M. Flammarion. When\r\nthe aeronaut has ascended some distance the earth loses its flat\r\nappearance, and appears as concave as the firmament above. Guide ropes\r\nare usually attached to balloons, and as they rest upon the ground\r\nthey relieve the balloon of the amount of weight the length trailing\r\nwould cause. They thus act as a kind of substitute for ballast as the\r\nballoon is descending. Most of the danger of aerial travelling lies in\r\nthe descent; and though in fine weather the aeronaut can calculate to a\r\nnicety where he will descend, on a windy day, he must cast a grapnel,\r\nwhich catches with an ugly jerk, and the balloon bounds and strains at\r\nher moorings.\r\n\r\nAlthough many attempts have been made to guide balloons through the\r\nair, no successful apparatus has ever been completed for use. Paddles,\r\nsails, fans, and screws have all been tried, but have failed to achieve\r\nthe desired end. Whether man will ever be able to fly we cannot of\r\ncourse say. In the present advancing state of science it may not be\r\nimpossible ere long to supply human beings with an apparatus worked\r\nby electricity, perhaps, which will enable them to mount into the air\r\nand sustain themselves. But even the bird cannot always fly without\r\nprevious momentum. A rook will run before it rises, and many other\r\nbirds have to “get up steam,” as it were, before they can soar in the\r\natmosphere. Eagles and such heavy birds find it very difficult to rise\r\nfrom the ground. We know that vultures when gorged cannot move at all,\r\nor certainly cannot fly away; and eagles take up their positions on\r\nhigh rocks, so that they may launch down on their prey, and avoid the\r\ndifficulty of rising from the ground. They swoop down with tremendous\r\nmomentum and carry off their booty, but often lose their lives from\r\nthe initial difficulty of soaring immediately. We fear man’s weight\r\nwill militate against his ever becoming a flying animal. When we obtain\r\na knowledge of the atmospheric currents we shall no doubt be able to\r\nnavigate our balloons; but until then—and the information is as yet\r\nvery limited, and the currents themselves very variable—we must be\r\ncontent to rise and fall in the air, and travel at the will of the wind\r\nin the upper regions of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTION._\r\n\r\n WHAT CHEMISTRY IS—THE ELEMENTS—METALLIC AND NON-METALLIC—ATOMIC\r\n WEIGHT—ACIDS—ALKALIS—BASES—SALTS—CHEMICAL COMBINATION AND STUDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemistry is the science of phenomena which are attended by a change\r\nof the objects which produce them. We know that when a candle burns,\r\nor when wood is burned, or even a piece of metal becomes what we term\r\n“rusty,” that certain chemical changes take place. There is a change\r\nby what is termed chemical action. Rust on iron is not iron; it is\r\noxide of iron. The oxygen of the air causes it. So we endeavour, by\r\nChemistry, to find out the nature of various bodies, their changes, and\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.—The Laboratory.]\r\n\r\nIn nature we have simple and compound bodies. The former are called\r\nELEMENTS. We must not confuse these elements with the so-called\r\nelements—earth, air, fire, and water. These are really compound bodies.\r\nAn element is a substance or a gas which is not composed of more than\r\none constituent; _it is itself_—a compound of perfectly identical\r\nparticles. Every “compound” body, therefore, must be made up of some of\r\nthe elements, of which there are sixty-five. These bodies are divided\r\ninto non-metallic and metallic elements, and all bodies are composed\r\nof them, or are these bodies themselves. The list is as follows. The\r\nnon-metallic elements are “metalloids.” We have omitted fractions from\r\nthe weights, on which chemists differ.\r\n\r\n TABLE OF ELEMENTS WITH THEIR CHEMICAL SYMBOLS AND COMBINING WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n  Non-Metallic                 Atomic or\r\n    Elements.

Zircon, four-cornered (Ceylon).\r\n\r\n *Arsenic is sometimes considered a non-metallic and sometimes a\r\n metallic substance.\r\n\r\nThe term “combining weight” requires a little explanation. We are\r\naware that water, for instance, is made up of oxygen and hydrogen in\r\ncertain proportions. This we will prove by-and-by. The proportions are\r\nin eighteen grains or parts of water, sixteen parts (by weight) of\r\noxygen, and two parts (by weight) of hydrogen. These are the weights\r\nor proportions in which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water,\r\nand such weights are always the same in these proportions. Chemical\r\ncombination always occurs for certain substances in certain proportions\r\nwhich never vary in those compounds, and if we wish to extract oxygen\r\nfrom an oxide we must take the aggregate amount of the combining\r\nweights of the oxide, and we shall find the proportion of oxygen; for\r\nthe compound always weighs the same as the sum of the elements that\r\ncompose it. To return to the illustration of water. The molecule of\r\nwater is made up of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. One\r\natom of the former weighs sixteen times the atom of the latter. The\r\nweights given in the foregoing table are _atomic_ weights, and the law\r\nof their proportions is called the Atomic Theory.\r\n\r\nAn _atom_ in chemistry is usually considered the smallest quantity of\r\nmatter that exists, and is indivisible. A _molecule_ is supposed to\r\ncontain two or more atoms, and is the smallest portion of a compound\r\nbody. The standard atom is hydrogen, which is put down as 1, because\r\nwe find that when one part by weight of hydrogen is put in combination,\r\nit must have many more parts _by weight_ of others to form a compound.\r\nTwo grains of hydrogen, combining with sixteen of oxygen, makes\r\neighteen of water, as we have already seen.\r\n\r\nTake an example so plainly given by Professor Roscoe, remembering that\r\nthe numbers in our table represent the fixed weight or proportion by\r\nweight in which the simple body combines. The red oxide of mercury\r\ncontains sixteen parts by weight of oxygen to two hundred parts by\r\nweight of mercury (we see the same numbers in the table); these\r\ncombined make two hundred and sixteen parts of oxide. So to obtain 16\r\nlbs. of oxygen we must get 216 lbs. of the powder. It is the same all\r\nthrough, and it will be found by experiment that if any more parts\r\nthan these fixed proportions be taken to form a compound, some of that\r\nelement used in excess will remain free. Lime is made up of calcium and\r\noxygen. We find calcium combining weight is forty, oxygen sixteen. Lime\r\nis oxide of calcium in these proportions (by weight).\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to express the number of atoms in a compound we write the\r\nnumber underneath when more than one; thus water is H_{2}O. Sulphuric\r\nacid H_{2}SO_{4}. As we proceed we will give the various formulæ when\r\nconsidering the chief elements.\r\n\r\nIn chemistry we have acids, alkalis, and salts, with metallic oxides,\r\ntermed _bases_, or bodies, that when combined with _acids_ form\r\n_salts_. Alkalis are bases.\r\n\r\nACIDS are compounds which possess an acid taste, impart red\r\ncolour to vegetable blues, but lose their qualities when combined with\r\nbases. Hydrogen is present in all acids. There are insoluble acids.\r\nSilicic acid, for instance, is not soluble in water, has no sour taste,\r\nand will not redden the test litmus paper. On the other hand, there are\r\nsubstances (not acids) which possess the characteristics of acids, and\r\nmost acids have only one or two of these characteristics.\r\n\r\nThus it has come to pass that the term “acid” has in a measure dropped\r\nout from scientific nomenclature, and salt of hydrogen has been\r\nsubstituted by chemists. For popular exposition, however, the term is\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nALKALIS are bases distinguished by an alkaline taste. The\r\nderivation is from Arabic, _al-kali_. They are characterized by certain\r\nproperties, and they change vegetable blues to green, and will restore\r\nthe blue to a substance which has been reddened by acid. They are\r\nsoluble in water, and the solutions are caustic in their effects.\r\nPotash, soda, and ammonia are alkalis, or chemically, the oxides of\r\npotassium, sodium, ammonium, lithium, and cæsium are all alkalis.\r\nPotash is sometimes called “caustic” potash. There are alkaline earths,\r\nsuch as oxides of barium, strontium, etc. _Bases_ may be defined as the\r\nconverse of acids.\r\n\r\nAcids and alkalis are then evidently opposite in character, and yet\r\nthey readily combine, and in chemistry we shall find that unlike bodies\r\nare very fond of combining (just as opposite electricities attract\r\neach other), and the body made by this combination differs in its\r\nproperties from its constituents.\r\n\r\nSALTS are composed of acids and bases, and are considered\r\nneutral compounds, but there are other bodies not salts, which likewise\r\ncome under that definition—sugar, for instance. As a rule, when acids\r\nand alkalis combine _salts_ are found.\r\n\r\nChemical phenomena are divided into two groups, called _inorganic_ and\r\n_organic_, comprising the simple and compound aspects of the subject,\r\nthe elementary substances being in the first, and the chemistry of\r\nanimals or vegetables, or organic substances, in the latter. In the\r\ninorganic section we shall become acquainted with the elements and\r\ntheir combinations so often seen as _minerals_ in nature. Chemical\r\n_preparations_ are artificially prepared. To consider these elements we\r\nmust have certain appliances, and indeed a laboratory is needed. Heat,\r\nas we have already seen, plays a great part in developing substances,\r\nand by means of heat we can do a great deal in the way of chemical\r\ndecomposition. It expands, and thus diminishes cohesion; it counteracts\r\nthe chemical attraction. Light and electricity also decompose chemical\r\ncombinations. But before proceeding it will be as well to notice a few\r\nfacts showing how Nature has balanced all things.\r\n\r\nThe earth, and its surrounding envelope, the atmosphere, consist of a\r\nnumber of elements, which in myriad combinations give us everything we\r\npossess,—the air we breathe, the water we drink, the fire that warms\r\nus, are all made up of certain elements or gases. Water, hydrogen and\r\noxygen; air, oxygen and nitrogen. Fire is combustion evolving light and\r\nheat. Chemical union always evolves heat, and when such union proceeds\r\nvery rapidly fire is the result.\r\n\r\nIn all these combinations we shall find when we study chemistry that\r\nnot a particle or atom of matter is ever lost. It may change or combine\r\nor be “given off,” but the matter in some shape or way exists still.\r\nWe may burn things, and rid ourselves, as we think, of them. We do rid\r\nourselves of the compounds, the elements remain somewhere. We only\r\nalter the _condition_. During combustion, as in a candle or a fire,\r\nthe simple bodies assume gaseous or other forms, such as carbon, but\r\nthey do not escape far. True they pass beyond our ken, but nature is so\r\nnicely balanced that there is a place for everything, and everything\r\nis in its place under certain conditions which never alter. We cannot\r\n_destroy_ and we cannot _create_. We may prepare a combination, and\r\nscience has even succeeded in producing a form like the diamond—a\r\ncrystal of carbon which looks like that most beautiful of all crystals,\r\nbut we cannot make a diamond after all. We can only separate the\r\nchemical compounds. We can turn diamonds into charcoal it is true,\r\nbut we cannot create “natural” products. We can take a particle of\r\nan element and hide it, or let it pass beyond our ken, and remain\r\nincapable of detection, but the particle is there all the time, and\r\nwhen we retrace our steps we shall find it as it was before.\r\n\r\nThis view of chemistry carries it as a science beyond the mere holiday\r\namusement we frequently take it to be. It is a grand study, a study\r\nfor a lifetime. Nature is always willing, like a kind, good mother as\r\nshe is, to render us up her secrets if we inquire respectfully and\r\nlovingly. The more we inquire the more we shall find we have to learn.\r\nIn these and the following pages we can only tell you a few things,\r\nbut no one need be turned away because he does not find all he wants.\r\nWe never do get all we want in life, and there are many first-rate\r\nmen—scientists—who would give “half their kingdom” for a certain bit\r\nof knowledge concerning some natural phenomena. There are numerous\r\nexcellent treatises on chemistry, and exhaustive as they are, at\r\npresent they do not tell us all. Let these popular pages lead us to the\r\nstudy of nature, and we shall find our labour far from onerous and full\r\nof interest, daily increasing to the end, when we shall know no more of\r\nearth, or chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary we will put our workshop aside, and show you something\r\nof _Chemistry without a Laboratory_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY WITHOUT A LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out the possibility of going through a course\r\nof physics without any special apparatus, we shall now endeavour to\r\nshow our readers the method of performing some experiments in chemistry\r\nwithout a laboratory, or at any rate with only a few simple and\r\ninexpensive appliances. The preparation of gases, such as hydrogen,\r\ncarbonic acid, and oxygen, is very easily accomplished, but we shall\r\nhere point out principally a series of experiments that are not so much\r\nknown. We will commence, for example, by describing an interesting\r\nexperiment which often occurs in a course of chemistry. Ammoniacal\r\ngas combined with the elements of water is analogous to a metallic\r\noxide which includes a metallic root, _ammonium_. This hypothetically\r\ncomposed metal may be in a manner perceived, since it is possible to\r\namalgamate it with mercury by operating in the following manner:—We\r\ntake a porcelain mortar, in which we pour a quantity of mercury, and\r\nthen cut some thin strips of sodium, which are thrown into the mercury.\r\nBy stirring it about with the pestle a loud cracking is produced,\r\naccompanied by a flame, which bears evidence to the union of the\r\nmercury and the sodium, and the formation of an amalgam of sodium. If\r\nthis amalgam of sodium is put into a slender glass tube containing a\r\nconcentrated solution of hydrochlorate of ammonia in water, we see\r\nthe ammonia expand in an extraordinary manner, and spout out from the\r\nend of the tube, which is now too small to contain it, in the form\r\nof a metallic substance (fig. 302). In this case, the ammonium, the\r\nradical which exists in the ammoniacal salts, becomes amalgamated with\r\nthe mercury, driving out the sodium with which it had previously been\r\ncombined; the ammonium thus united with the mercury becomes decomposed\r\nin ammoniacal gas and hydrogen, the mercury assuming its ordinary form.\r\nPhosphate of ammonia is very valuable from its property of rendering\r\nthe lightest materials, such as gauze or muslin, incombustible. Dip a\r\npiece of muslin in a solution of phosphate of ammonia, and dry it in\r\ncontact with the air; that done, you will find it is impossible to set\r\nfire to the material; it will get charred, but you cannot make it burn.\r\nIt is to be wished that this useful precaution were oftener taken in\r\nthe matter of ball-dresses, which have so frequently been the cause of\r\nserious accidents. There is no danger whatever with a dress that has\r\nbeen soaked in phosphate of ammonia, which is very inexpensive, and\r\neasily procured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.—Experiment with ammonium.]\r\n\r\nFor preparing cool drinks in the summer ammoniacal salts are very\r\nuseful; some _nitrate of ammonia_ mixed with its weight in water,\r\nproduces a considerable lowering of the temperature, and is very useful\r\nfor making ice. _Volatile alkali_, which is so useful an application\r\nfor stings from insects, is a solution of ammoniacal gas in water, and\r\n_sal-volatile_, which has such a refreshing and reanimating odour, is\r\na carbonate of ammonia. We often see in chemists’ shops large glass\r\njars, the insides of which are covered with beautiful transparent white\r\ncrystals, which are formed over a red powder placed at the bottom of\r\nthe vase. These crystals are the result of a combination of cyanogen\r\nand iodine. Nothing is easier than the preparation of _iodide of\r\ncyanogen_, a very volatile body, which possesses a strong tendency to\r\nassume a definite crystalline form. We pound in a mortar a mixture of\r\n50 grams of cyanide of mercury, and 100 grams of iodine; under the\r\naction of the pestle the powder, which was at first a brownish colour,\r\nassumes a shade of bright vermilion red. The cyanogen combines with\r\nthe iodine, and transforms itself into fumes with great rapidity. If\r\nthe powder is placed at the bottom of a stoppered glass jar, the fumes\r\nof the iodide of cyanogen immediately condense, thereby producing\r\nbeautiful crystals which often attain considerable size (fig. 303).\r\nCyanogen forms with sulphur a remarkable substance, _sulpho-cyanogen_,\r\nthe properties of which we cannot describe without exceeding the\r\nlimits of our present treatise; we shall therefore confine ourselves\r\nto pointing out one of its combinations, which is well known at the\r\npresent day, owing to its singular properties. This is sulpho-cyanide\r\nof mercury, with which small combustible cones are made, generally\r\ndesignated by the pompous title of _Pharaoh’s serpents_. For making\r\nthese, some sulpho-cyanide of potassium is poured into a solution of\r\nnitrate acid on mercury, which forms a precipitate of sulpho-cyanide\r\nof mercury. This is a white, combustible powder, which after passing\r\nthrough a filter, should be transformed into a stiff pulp by means of\r\nwater containing a solution of gum. The pulp is afterwards mixed with\r\na small quantity of nitrate of potash, and fashioned into cones or\r\ncylinders of about an inch and a quarter in length, which should be\r\nthoroughly dried. The egg thus obtained can be hatched by the simple\r\napplication of a lighted match, and gives rise to the phenomenon.\r\nThe sulpho-cyanide slowly expands, the cylinder increases in length,\r\nand changes to a yellowish substance, which dilates and extends to a\r\nlength of twenty or five-and-twenty inches. It has the appearance of a\r\ngenuine serpent, which has just started into existence, and stretches\r\nout its tortuous coils, endeavouring to escape from its narrow prison\r\n(fig. 304). The residue is composed partly of cyanide of mercury and of\r\npara-cyanogen; it constitutes a very poisonous substance, which should\r\nbe immediately thrown away or burned. It can be easily powdered into\r\ndust in the fingers. During the decomposition of the sulpho-cyanide of\r\nmercury, quantities of sulphurous acid are thrown off, and it is to be\r\nregretted that Pharaoh’s serpent should herald his appearance by such a\r\ndisagreeable, suffocating odour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.—Iodide of cyanogen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.—Pharaoh’s serpent.]\r\n\r\nAfter these few preliminary experiments, we will endeavour to show\r\nthe interest afforded by the study of chemistry in relation to the\r\ncommonest substances of every-day life. We will first consider the\r\nnature of a few pinches of salt. We know that kitchen salt, or sea\r\nsalt, is white or greyish, according to its degree of purity; that it\r\nhas a peculiar flavour, is soluble in water, and makes a peculiar\r\ncrackling when thrown in the fire. But though its principal physical\r\nproperties may be familiar enough, many people are entirely ignorant of\r\nits chemical nature and elementary composition. Kitchen salt contains\r\na metal, combined with a gas possessing a very suffocating odour; the\r\nmetal is _sodium_, the gas is _chlorine_. The scientific name for the\r\nsubstance is _chloride of sodium_ (salt).[19] The metal contained in\r\ncommon salt in no way resembles ordinary metals; it is white like\r\nsilver, but tarnishes immediately in contact with air, and unites with\r\noxygen, thus transforming itself into _oxide of sodium_. To preserve\r\nthis singular metal it is necessary to protect it from the action of\r\nthe atmosphere, and to keep it in a bottle containing oil of naptha.\r\nSodium is soft, and it is possible with a pair of scissors to cut it\r\nlike a ball of soft bread that has been kneaded in the hand. It is\r\nlighter than water, and when placed in a basin of water floats on the\r\ntop like a piece of cork; only it is disturbed, and takes the form of\r\na small brilliant sphere; great effervescence is also produced as it\r\nfloats along, for it reduces the water to a common temperature by its\r\ncontact. By degrees the small metallic ball disappears from view, after\r\nblazing into flame (fig. 305).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.—Combustion of sodium in water.]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable experiment is very easy to carry out, and sodium is now\r\neasily procured at any shop where chemicals are sold. The combustion\r\nof sodium in water can be explained in a very simple manner. Water, as\r\nwe know, is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Sodium, by reason of its\r\ngreat affinity for the latter gas, combines with it, and forms a very\r\nsoluble oxide; the hydrogen is released and thrown off, as we shall\r\nperceive by placing a lighted match in the jar, when the combustible\r\ngas ignites.\r\n\r\nOxide of sodium has a great affinity for water; it combines with it,\r\nand absorbs it in great quantities. It is a solid, white substance,\r\nwhich burns and cauterizes the skin; it is also _alkaline_, and brings\r\nback the blue colour to litmus paper that has been reddened by acids.\r\n\r\nSodium combines easily also with chlorine. If plunged into a jar\r\ncontaining this gas it is transformed into a substance, which is sea\r\nsalt. If the chlorine is in excess a part of the gas remains free, for\r\nsimple substances do not mingle in undetermined ratios; they combine,\r\non the contrary, in very definite proportions, and 35·5 gr. of dry\r\nchlorine always unites with the same quantity of soda equal to 23\r\ngrams. A gram of kitchen salt is formed, therefore, of 0·606 gr. of\r\nchlorine, and 0·394 gr. of sodium. Besides sea salt, there are a number\r\nof different salts which may be made the object of curious experiments.\r\nWe know that caustic soda, or oxide of sodium, is an alkaline product\r\npossessing very powerful properties; it burns the skin, and destroys\r\norganic substances.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is endowed with no less powerful properties; if a little\r\nis dropped on the hand it produces great pain and a sense of burning; a\r\npiece of wood plunged into this acid is almost immediately carbonized.\r\nIf we mix forty-nine grams of sulphuric acid and thirty-one grams of\r\ncaustic soda a very intense reaction is produced, accompanied by a\r\nconsiderable elevation of temperature; after it has cooled we have\r\na substance which can be handled with impunity; the acid and alkali\r\nhave combined, and their properties have been reciprocally destroyed.\r\nThey have now originated a _salt_ which is _sulphate of soda_. This\r\nsubstance exercises no influence on litmus paper, and resembles in no\r\nway the substances from which it originated.\r\n\r\nThere are an infinite number of salts which result in like manner\r\nfrom the combination of an acid with an alkali or _base_. Some, such\r\nas sulphate of copper, or chromate of potash, are coloured; others,\r\nlike sulphate of soda, are colourless. The last-mentioned salt, with a\r\nnumber of others, will take a crystalline form; if dissolved in boiling\r\nwater, and the solution left to stand, we shall perceive a deposit of\r\ntransparent prisms of very remarkable appearance. This was discovered\r\nby Glauber, and was formerly called _Glauber’s salts_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.—Preparation of a solution saturated with\r\nsulphate of soda.]\r\n\r\nSulphate of soda is very soluble in water, and at a temperature of\r\nthirty-three (Centigr.) water can dissolve it in the greatest degree.\r\nIf we pour a layer of oil on a solution saturated with Glauber’s\r\nsalts, and let it stand, it will not produce crystals; but if we\r\nthrust a glass rod through the oil into contact with the solution,\r\ncrystallization will be instantaneous. This singular phenomenon becomes\r\neven more striking when we put the warm concentrated solution into a\r\nslender glass tube, A B, which we close after having driven out the\r\nair by the bubbling of the liquid (fig. 306). When the tube has been\r\nclosed, the crystals of sulphate of soda will not form, even with the\r\ntemperature at zero; nevertheless the salts, being less soluble cold\r\nthan hot, are found in the fluid in a proportion ten times larger than\r\nthey would contain under ordinary conditions. If the end of the tube be\r\nbroken the salt will crystallize immediately. We will describe another\r\nexperiment, but little known and very remarkable, which exhibits in a\r\nstriking manner the process of instantaneous crystallizations. Let one\r\nhundred and fifty parts of hyposulphite of soda be dissolved in fifteen\r\nparts of water, and the solution slowly poured into a test-glass,\r\npreviously warmed by means of boiling water, until the vessel is about\r\nhalf-full. One hundred parts of acetate of soda is then dissolved in\r\nfifteen parts of water, and poured slowly into the first solution,\r\nso that they form two layers perfectly distinct from each other. The\r\ntwo solutions are then covered with a little boiling water, which,\r\nhowever is not represented in our illustration. After it has been left\r\nto stand and cool slowly, we have two solutions of hyposulphite of\r\nsoda and acetate of soda superposed on each other. A thread, at the\r\nend of which is fixed a small crystal of hyposulphite of soda, is then\r\nlowered into the test-glass; the crystal passes through the solution of\r\nacetate without disturbing it, but it has scarcely reached the lower\r\nsolution of hyposulphite than the salt crystallizes instantaneously.\r\n(_See_ the test-glass on the left of fig. 307.) We then lower into the\r\nupper solution a crystal of acetate of soda, suspended from another\r\nthread. This salt then crystallizes also. (_See_ experiment glass on\r\nthe right of fig. 307.) This very successful experiment is one of the\r\nmost remarkable belonging to the subject of instantaneous crystals.\r\nThe successive appearance of crystals of hyposulphite of soda, which\r\ntake the form of large, rhomboidal prisms, terminating at the two\r\nextremities with an oblique surface, and the crystals of acetate of\r\nsoda, which have the appearance of rhomboidal, oblique prisms, cannot\r\nfail to strike the attention and excite the interest of those who are\r\nnot initiated into these kinds of experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.—Experiment of instantaneous crystallization.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable instantaneous crystallization is that of alum. If we\r\nleave standing a solution of this salt it gradually cools, at the same\r\ntime becoming limpid and clear. When it is perfectly cold, if we plunge\r\ninto it a small octahedral crystal of alum suspended from a thread, we\r\nperceive that crystallization instantly commences on the surface of the\r\nsmall crystal; it rapidly and perceptibly increases in size, until it\r\nnearly fills the whole jar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON METALS AND PRECIOUS METALS.\r\n\r\nHow many invalids have swallowed _magnesia_ without suspecting that\r\nthis powder contains a metal nearly as white as silver, and is\r\nmalleable, and capable of burning with so intense a light that it\r\nrivals even the electric light in brilliancy! If any of our readers\r\ndesire to prepare magnesium themselves it can be done in the following\r\nmanner:—Some white magnesia must be obtained from the chemist, and\r\nafter having been calcined, must be submitted to the influence of\r\nhydrochloric acid and hydrochlorate of ammonia. A clear solution will\r\nthus be obtained, which by means of evaporation under the influence\r\nof heat, furnishes a double chloride, hydrated and crystallised. This\r\nchloride, if heated to redness in an earthenware crucible, leaves as\r\na residue a nacreous product, composed of micaceous, white scales,\r\nchloride of anhydrous magnesium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.—Group of alum crystals.]\r\n\r\nIf six hundred grams of this chloride of magnesium are mixed with one\r\nhundred grams of chloride of sodium, or kitchen salt, and the same\r\nquantity of fluoride of calcium and metallic sodium in small fragments,\r\nand the mixture is put into an earthenware crucible made red-hot, and\r\nheated for a quarter of an hour under a closed lid, we shall find on\r\npouring out the fluid on to a handful of earth, that we have obtained\r\ninstead of scoria, forty-five grams of metallic magnesium. The metal\r\nthus obtained is impure, and to remove all foreign substances it\r\nmust be heated in a charcoal tube, through which passes a current of\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nMagnesium is now produced in great abundance, and is very inexpensive.\r\nIt is a metal endowed with a great affinity for oxygen, and it is\r\nonly necessary to thrust it into the flame of a candle to produce\r\ncombustion; it burns with a brightness that the eye can scarcely\r\ntolerate, and is transformed into a white powder—oxide of magnesium,\r\nor magnesia. Combustion is still more active in oxygen, and powder\r\nof magnesium placed in a jar filled with this gas produces a perfect\r\nshower of fire of very beautiful effect. To give an idea of the\r\nlighting power of magnesium, we may add that a wire of this metal,\r\nwhich is 29/100 of a millimetre in diameter, produces by combustion a\r\nlight equal to that of seventy-four candles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.—Calcined alum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.—Preparation of metallic iron.]\r\n\r\nThe humble earth of the fields—the clay which is used in our potteries,\r\nalso contains aluminium, that brilliant metal which is as malleable\r\nas silver, and unspoilable as gold. When clay is submitted to the\r\ninfluence of sulphuric acid and chloride of potassium, we obtain alum,\r\nwhich is a sulphate of alumina and potash. Alum is a colourless salt,\r\nwhich crystallizes on the surface of water in beautiful octahedrons of\r\nstriking regularity. Fig. 308 represents a group of alum crystals. This\r\nsalt is much used in the colouring of fabrics; it is also used for the\r\nsizing of papers, and the clarification of tallow. Doctors also use\r\nit as an astringent and caustic substance. When alum is submitted to\r\nthe action of heat in an earthenware crucible, it loses the water of\r\ncrystallization which it contains, and expands in a singular manner,\r\noverflowing from the jar in which it is calcined (fig. 309).\r\n\r\nIron, the most important of common metals, rapidly unites with oxygen,\r\nand, as we know, when a piece of this metal is exposed to the influence\r\nof damp air, it becomes covered with a reddish substance. In the\r\nwell-known experiment of the formation of rust, the iron gradually\r\noxidises without its temperature rising, but this combination of iron\r\nwith oxygen is effected much more rapidly under the influence of heat.\r\nIf, for example, we redden at the fire a nail attached to a wire, and\r\ngive it a movement of rotation as of a sling, we see flashing out\r\nfrom the metal a thousand bright sparks due to the combination of\r\niron with oxygen, and the formation of an oxide. Particles of iron\r\nburn spontaneously in contact with air, and this property for many\r\ncenturies has been utilized in striking a tinder-box; that is to say,\r\nin separating, by striking a flint, small particles of iron, which\r\nignite under the influence of the heat produced by the friction. We can\r\nprepare iron in such atoms that it ignites at an ordinary temperature\r\nby simple contact with the air. To bring it to this state of extreme\r\ntenuity, we reduce its oxalate by hydrogen. We prepare an apparatus for\r\nhydrogen as shown in fig. 310, and the gas produced at A is\r\npassed through a desiccative tube, B, and finally reaches a\r\nglass receptacle, C, in which some oxalate of iron is placed.\r\nThe latter salt, under the combined influence of hydrogen and heat,\r\nis reduced to metallic iron, which assumes the appearance of a fine\r\nblack powder. When the experiment is completed the glass vessel is\r\nclosed, and the iron, thus protected from contact with the air, can be\r\npreserved indefinitely; but if it is exposed to the air by breaking\r\noff the end of the receptacle (fig. 311), it ignites immediately,\r\nproducing a shower of fire of very beautiful effect. Iron thus prepared\r\nis known under the name of _pyrophoric iron_. Iron is acted upon in\r\na very powerful manner by most acids. If some nitric acid is poured\r\non iron nails, a stream of red, nitrous vapour is let loose, and the\r\noxidised iron is dissolved in the liquid to the condition of nitrate\r\nof iron. This experiment is very easy to perform, and it gives an idea\r\nof the energy of certain chemical actions. We have endeavoured to\r\nrepresent its appearance in fig. 312. Fuming nitric acid does not act\r\non iron, and prevents it being attacked by ordinary nitric acid. This\r\nproperty has given rise to a very remarkable experiment on passive\r\niron. It consists in placing some nails in a glass, into which some\r\nfuming nitric acid is poured, which produces no result; the fuming acid\r\nis then taken out, and is replaced by ordinary nitric acid, which no\r\nlonger acts on the iron rendered passive by the smoking acid. After\r\nthis, if the nails are touched by a piece of iron, which has not\r\nundergone the action of nitric acid, they are immediately acted upon,\r\nand a giving off of nitrous vapour is manifested with great energy.\r\nLead is a very soft metal, and can even be scratched by the nails. It\r\nis also extremely pliable, and so entirely devoid of elasticity that\r\nwhen bent it has no tendency whatever to return to its primitive form.\r\nLead is heavy, and has a density represented by 11·4; that is to say,\r\nthe weight of a quart of water being one kilogram, that of the same\r\nvolume of lead is 11·400 k.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.—Pyrophoric iron.]\r\n\r\nFig. 313 represents cylindrical bars of the best known metals, all\r\nweighing the same, showing their comparative density.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.—Iron and nitric acid.]\r\n\r\nLead, like tin, is capable of taking a beautiful crystalline form\r\nwhen placed in solution by a metal that is less oxydisable. The\r\ncrystallization of lead, represented in fig. 314, is designated by the\r\nname of the _Tree of Saturn_. This is how the experiment is produced:\r\nThirty grams of acetate of lead are dissolved in a quart of water, and\r\nthe solution is poured into a vase of a spherical shape. A stopper for\r\nthis vase is made out of a piece of zinc, to which five or six separate\r\nbrass wires are attached; these are plunged into the fluid, and we\r\nsee the wires become immediately covered with brilliant crystallized\r\nspangles of lead, which continue increasing in size.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists, who were familiar with this experiment, believed that\r\nit consisted in a transformation of copper into lead, while in reality\r\nit only consists in the substitution of one metal for another. The\r\ncopper is dissolved in the liquid, and is replaced by the lead, but no\r\nmetamorphosis is brought about. We may vary at will the form of the\r\nvase or the arrangement of the wire; thus it is easy to form letters,\r\nnumbers, or figures, by the crystallization of brilliant spangles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Platinum Density 21.50\r\n  Gold D. 19.25\r\n  Mercury D. 13.56\r\n  Lead D. 11.35\r\n  Silver D. 10.47\r\n  Bismuth D. 9.82\r\n  Copper D. 8.78\r\n  Nickel D. 8.27\r\n  Tin D. 7.29\r\n  Iron D. 7.20\r\n  Zinc D. 6.86\r\n  Aluminium D. 2.56\r\n  Magnesium D. 1.43\r\n  Sodium D. 0.97\r\n  Fig. 313.—Representation of bars of metal, all of the same weight.]\r\n\r\nCopper, when it is pure, has a characteristic red colour, which\r\nprevents it being confounded with any other metal; it dissolves easily\r\nin nitric acid, and with considerable effervescence, giving off vapour\r\nvery abundantly. This property has been put to good use in engraving\r\nwith aqua fortis. A copper plate is covered with a layer of varnish,\r\nand when it is dry some strokes are made on it by means of a graver;\r\nif nitric acid is poured on the plate when thus prepared, the copper\r\nis only acted on in the parts that have been exposed by the point of\r\nsteel. By afterwards removing the varnish, we have an engraved plate,\r\nwhich will serve for printing purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.—Tree of Saturn.]\r\n\r\nAmong experiments that may be attempted with common metals, we may\r\nmention that in which salts of tin are employed. Tin has a great\r\ntendency to assume a crystalline form, and it will be easy to show\r\nthis property by an interesting experiment. A concentrated solution\r\nof proto-chloride of tin, prepared by dissolving some metallic tin in\r\nhydrochloric acid, is placed in a test glass; then a rod of tin is\r\nintroduced, as shown in fig. 315. Some water is next slowly poured on\r\nthe rod, so that it gradually trickles down, and prevents the mingling\r\nof the proto-chloride of tin. The vessel is then left to stand,\r\nand we soon see brilliant crystals starting out from the rod. This\r\ncrystallization is not effected in the water; it is explained by an\r\nelectric influence, into the details of which we cannot enter without\r\noverstepping our limits; it is known as “Jupiter’s Tree.” It is well\r\nknown that alchemists, with their strange system of nomenclature,\r\nbelieved there was a certain mysterious relation between the seven\r\nmetals then known and the seven planets; each metal was dedicated to\r\na planet; tin was called Jupiter; silver, Luna; gold, Sol; lead,\r\nSaturn; iron, Mars; quicksilver, Mercury; and copper, Venus. The\r\ncrystallization of tin may be recognised also by rubbing a piece of\r\nthis metal with hydrochloric acid; the fragments thus rubbed off\r\nexhibit specimens of branching crystals similar to the hoar-frost which\r\nwe see in severe winter weather. If we bend a rod of tin in our hands\r\nthe crystals break, with a peculiar rustling sound.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of precious metals, we may call to mind that the\r\nalchemists considered gold as the king of metals, and the other\r\nvaluable ones as noble metals. This definition is erroneous, if we\r\nlook upon the useful as the most precious; for, in that case, iron and\r\ncopper would be placed in the first rank. If gold were found abundantly\r\non the surface of the soil, and iron was extremely rare, we should seek\r\nmost eagerly for this useful metal, and should despise the former,\r\nwith which we can neither make a ploughshare nor any other implement\r\nof industry. Nevertheless, the scarcity of gold, its beautiful yellow\r\ncolour, and its unalterability when in contact with air, combine to\r\nplace it in the first rank in the list of precious metals. Gold is very\r\nheavy; its density is represented by the figure 19·5. It is the most\r\nmalleable and the most ductile of metals, and can be reduced by beating\r\nto such thin sheets that ten thousand can be laid, one over the other,\r\nto obtain the thickness of a millimetre. With a grain of gold a thread\r\nmay be manufactured extending a league in length, and so fine that it\r\nresembles a spider’s web. When gold is beaten into thin sheets it is\r\nno longer opaque; if it is fastened, by means of a solution of gum, on\r\nto a sheet of glass, the light passes right through it, and presents\r\na very perceptible green shade. Gold is sometimes found scattered in\r\nsand, in a condition of impalpable dust, and, in certain localities,\r\nin irregular lumps of varying size, called nuggets. Gold is the least\r\nalterable of the metals, and can be exposed, indefinitely, to the\r\ncontact of humid atmosphere without oxidizing. It is not acted on by\r\nthe most powerful acids, and only dissolves in a mixture of nitric acid\r\nand hydrochloric acid. We can prove that gold resists the influence of\r\nacids by the following operation:—\r\n\r\nSome gold-leaf is placed in two small phials, the first containing\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the second nitric acid. The two vessels are\r\nwarmed on the stove, and whatever the duration of the ebullition of\r\nthe acids, the gold-leaf remains intact, and completely resists their\r\naction. If we then empty the contents of one phial into the other,\r\nthe hydrochloric and nitric acids are mixed, and we see the gold-leaf\r\nimmediately disappear, easily dissolved by the action of the liquid\r\n(_aqua regia_). Gold also changes when in contact with mercury; this is\r\nproved by suspending some gold-leaf above the surface of this liquid\r\n(fig. 316); it quickly changes, and unites with the fumes of the\r\nmercury, becoming of a greyish colour.\r\n\r\nSilver is more easily affected than gold, and though so white when\r\nfused, tarnishes rapidly in contact with air. It does not oxidize, but\r\nsulphurizes under the influence of hydro-sulphuric emanations. Silver\r\ndoes not combine directly with the oxygen of the atmosphere; but under\r\ncertain conditions it can dissolve great quantities of this gas. If it\r\nis fused in a small bone cupel, in contact with the air, and left to\r\ncool quickly, it expands in a remarkable manner, and gives off oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.—Jupiter’s Tree.]\r\n\r\nNitric acid dissolves silver very easily, by causing the formation\r\nof abundant fumes. When the solution evaporates, we perceive white\r\ncrystals forming, which are nitrate of silver. This fused nitrate of\r\nsilver takes the name of _lunar caustic_, and is employed in medicine.\r\nNitrate of silver is very poisonous; it possesses the singular property\r\nof turning black under the action of the sun’s rays, and is used in\r\nmany curious operations in photography. It is also employed in the\r\nmanufacture of dyes for the hair; it is applied to white hair with\r\ngall-nut, and under the influence of the light it turns black, and\r\ngives the hair a very dark shade. Salts of silver in solution with\r\nwater have the property of forming a precipitate under the influence of\r\nchlorides, such as sea salt. If a few grains of common salt are thrown\r\ninto a solution of nitrate of silver, it forms an abundant precipitate\r\nof chloride of silver, which blackens in the light. This precipitate,\r\ninsoluble in nitric acid, dissolves very easily in ammonia.\r\n\r\nPlatinum, which is the last of the precious metals that we have to\r\nconsider, is a greyish-white colour, and like gold is only affected by\r\na mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. It is the heaviest of\r\nall the ordinary metals; its density is 21·50. It is very malleable\r\nand ductile, and can be beaten into very thin sheets, and into wires as\r\nslender as wires of gold. Platinum wires have even been made so fine\r\nthat the eye can scarcely perceive them; these are known as Wollaston’s\r\ninvisible wires. Platinum resists the action of the most intense fire,\r\nand we can only fuse it by means of a blow-pipe and hydro-oxide gas.\r\nIts inalterability and the resistance it opposes to fire render it very\r\nvaluable for use in the laboratory. Small crucibles are made of it,\r\nwhich are used by chemists to calcine their precipitates in analytical\r\noperations, or to bring about reactions under the influence of a high\r\ntemperature. Platinum may be reduced to very small particles; it then\r\ntakes the form of a black powder. In this pulverulent condition it\r\nabsorbs gases with great rapidity, to such an extent that a cubic\r\ncentimetre can condense seven hundred and fifty times its own volume\r\nof hydrogen gas. It also condenses oxygen, and in a number of cases\r\nacts as a powerful agent. Platinum is also obtained in porous masses\r\n(“spongy platinum”), which produce phenomena of oxidation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.—Gold-leaf exposed to the fumes of mercury.]\r\n\r\nA very ingenious little lamp may be constructed which lights of\r\nitself without the help of a flame. It contains a bell of glass,\r\nwhich is filled with hydrogen gas, produced by the action exercised\r\nby a foundation of zinc on acidulated water. If the knob on the upper\r\npart of the apparatus is pressed, the hydrogen escapes, and comes in\r\ncontact with a piece of spongy platinum, which, acting by oxidation,\r\nbecomes ignited. The flame produced sets fire to a small oil lamp,\r\nwhich is opposite the jet of gas. This very ingenious lamp is known\r\nunder the name of Gay-Lussac’s lamp. Platinum can also produce, by mere\r\ncontact, a great number of chemical reactions. Place in a test glass an\r\nexplosive mixture formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of\r\noxygen; in this gas plunge a small piece of spongy platinum, and the\r\ncombination of the two bodies will be instantly brought about, making\r\na violent explosion. Make a small spiral of platinum red-hot in the\r\nflame of a lamp, having suspended it to a card; then plunge it quickly\r\ninto a glass containing ether, and you will see the metallic spiral\r\nremain red for some time, while in the air it would cool immediately.\r\nThis phenomenon is due to the action of oxidation which the platinum\r\nexercises over the fumes of ether. This curious experiment is known\r\nunder the name of _the lamp without a flame_. This remarkable oxidizing\r\npower of platinum, which has not yet been explained, was formerly\r\ndesignated by the title of _catalytic action_. But a phrase is not a\r\ntheory, and it is always preferable to avow one’s ignorance than to\r\nsimulate an apparent knowledge. Science is powerful enough to be able\r\nto express her doubts and uncertainties boldly. In observing nature we\r\nfind an experience of this, and often meet with facts which may be put\r\nto profit, and become useful in application; nevertheless it is often\r\nthe case that the why and the wherefore will for a long time escape the\r\nmost penetrating eye and lucid intelligence. It is true the admirable\r\napplications of science strike us with the importance of their results,\r\nand the wonderful inventions they originate; but if they turn to\r\naccount the observed facts of nature, what do they teach us as to the\r\nfirst cause of all things, the _wherefore_ of nature?—Almost nothing.\r\nWe must humbly confess our powerlessness, and say with d’Alembert: “The\r\nencyclopædia is very abundant, but what of that if it discourses of\r\nwhat we do not understand?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.—Discolouration of periwinkles by sulphuric\r\nacid.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL COLOURING OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nIn a course of chemistry, the action exercised by sulphurous acid\r\non coloured vegetable matter is proved by exposing violets to the\r\ninfluence of this gas, which whitens them instantaneously. Sulphurous\r\nacid, by its dis-oxidating properties, destroys the colour of many\r\nflowers, such as roses, periwinkles, etc. The experiment succeeds very\r\nreadily by means of the little apparatus which we give in fig. 317.\r\nWe dissolve in a small vessel some sulphur, which ignites in contact\r\nwith air, and gives rise, by its combination with oxygen, to sulphurous\r\nacid; the capsule is covered with a conical chimney, made out of a thin\r\nsheet of copper, and at the opening at the top the flowers that are to\r\nbe discoloured are placed. The action is very rapid, and a few seconds\r\nonly are necessary to render roses, periwinkles, and violets absolutely\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.—Experiment for turning columbines a green\r\ncolour with ammoniacal ether.]\r\n\r\nM. Filpol, a distinguished _savant_, has exhibited to the members of\r\nthe Scientific Association, Paris, the results which he obtained by\r\nsubjecting flowers to the influence of a mixture of sulphuric ether\r\nand some drops of ammonia; he has shown that, under the influence of\r\nthis liquid, a great number of violets or roses turn a deep green.\r\nWe have recently made on this subject a series of experiments which\r\nwe will here describe, and which may be easily attempted by those of\r\nour readers who are interested in the question. Some common ether is\r\npoured into a glass, and to it is added a small quantity of liquid\r\nammonia (about one-tenth of the volume). The flowers with which it\r\nis desired to experiment are then plunged into the fluid (fig. 318).\r\nA number of flowers, whose natural colour is red or violet, take\r\ninstantaneously a bright green tint; these are red geranium, violet,\r\nperiwinkle, lilac, red and pink roses, wall-flower, thyme, small\r\nblue campanula, fumeter, myosotis, and heliotrope. Other flowers,\r\nwhose colours are not of the same shade, take different tints when\r\nin contact with ammoniacal ether. The upper petal of the violet\r\nsweet-pea becomes dark blue, whilst the lower petal turns a bright\r\ngreen colour. The streaked carnation becomes brown and bright green.\r\nWhite flowers generally turn yellow, such as the white poppy, the\r\nvariegated snow-dragon, which becomes yellow and dark violet, the\r\nwhite rose, which takes a straw colour, white columbine, camomile,\r\nsyringa, white daisy, potatoe blossom, white julian, honeysuckle, and\r\nwhite foxglove, which in contact with ammoniacal ether assume more or\r\nless deep shades of yellow. White snap-dragon becomes yellow and dark\r\norange. Red geranium turns blue in a very remarkable fashion; with\r\nthe monkey-flower the ammoniacal ether only affects the red spots,\r\nwhich turn a brownish green; red snap-dragon turns a beautiful brown;\r\nvalerian takes a shade of grey; and the red corn-poppy assumes a dark\r\nviolet. Yellow flowers are not changed by ammoniacal ether; buttercups,\r\nmarigolds, and yellow snap-dragon preserve their natural colour. Leaves\r\nof a red colour are instantly turned green when placed in contact with\r\nammoniacal ether. The action of this liquid is so rapid that it is\r\neasy to procure green spots by pouring here and there a drop of the\r\nsolution. In like manner violet flowers, such as periwinkles, can be\r\nspotted with white, even without gathering them. We will complete our\r\nremarks on this subject with a description of experiments performed\r\nby M. Gabba in Italy by means of ammonia acting on flowers. M. Gabba\r\nsimply used a plate, in which he poured a certain quantity of solution\r\nof ammonia. He placed on the plate a funnel turned upside down, in the\r\ntube of which he arranged the flowers on which he wished to experiment.\r\nHe then found that under the influence of the ammonia the blue, violet,\r\nand purple flowers became a beautiful green, red flowers black, and\r\nwhite yellow, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most singular changes of colour are shown by flowers which are\r\ncomposed of different tints, their red streaks turning green, the\r\nwhite yellow, etc. Another curious example is that of red and white\r\nfuchsias, which, through the action of ammonia, turn yellow, blue, and\r\ngreen. When flowers have been subjected to these changes of colour,\r\nand afterwards plunged into pure water, they preserve their new tint\r\nfor several hours, after which they gradually return to their natural\r\ncolour. Another interesting observation, due to M. Gabba, is that\r\nasters, which are naturally inodorous, acquire an agreeable aromatic\r\nodour under the influence of ammonia. Asters of a violet colour become\r\nred when wetted with nitric acid mixed with water. On the other hand,\r\nif these same flowers are enclosed in a wooden box, where they are\r\nexposed to the fumes of hydrochloric acid, they become, in six hours’\r\ntime, a beautiful red colour, which they preserve when placed in a dry,\r\nshady place, after having been properly dried. Hydrochloric acid has\r\nthe effect of making flowers red that have been rendered green by the\r\naction of ammonia, and also alters their appearance very sensibly. We\r\nmay also mention, in conclusion, that ammonia, combined with ether,\r\nacts much more promptly than when employed alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE.\r\n\r\nArtificial flowers are frequently to be seen prepared in a particular\r\nmanner, which have the property of becoming phosphorescent in darkness,\r\nwhen they have been exposed to the action of a ray of light, solar or\r\nelectric. These curious chemical objects are connected with some very\r\ninteresting phenomena and remarkable experiments but little known at\r\nthe present time, to which we will now draw the reader’s attention.\r\n\r\nThe faculty possessed by certain bodies of emitting light when placed\r\nin certain conditions, is much more general than is usually supposed.\r\n\r\nM. Edmond Becquerel, to whom we owe a remarkable work on this subject,\r\ndivides the phenomena of phosphorescence into five distinct classes:\r\n\r\n1. _Phosphorescence through elevation of temperature._ Among the\r\nsubstances which exhibit this phenomenon in a high degree we may\r\nmention certain diamonds, coloured varieties of fluoride of calcium,\r\nsome minerals; and sulphur, known under the name of artificial\r\nphosphorus, when it has previously been exposed to the action of the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n2. _Phosphorescence through mechanical action._ This is to be observed\r\nwhen we rub certain bodies together, or against a hard substance. If we\r\nrub together two quartz crystals in the dark, we perceive red sparks;\r\nand when pounding chalk or sugar, there is also an emission of sparks.\r\n\r\n3. _Phosphorescence through electricity._ This is manifested by the\r\nlight accompanying disengagement of electricity, and when gases and\r\nrarefied vapours transmit electric discharges.\r\n\r\n4. _Spontaneous Phosphorescence_ is observed, as every one knows,\r\nin connection with several kinds of living creatures,—glow-worms,\r\nnoctilucids, etc., and similar phosphorescent effects are produced also\r\nwith organic substances, animal or vegetable, before putrefaction sets\r\nin. It is manifested also at the flowering time of certain plants, etc.\r\n\r\n5. _Phosphorescence through insolation and the action of light._ “It\r\nconsists,” says M. Edmond Becquerel, “in exposing for some instants to\r\nthe action of the sun, or to that of rays emanating from a powerful\r\nluminous source, certain mineral or organic substances, which\r\nimmediately become luminous, and shine in the dark with a light, the\r\ncolour and brilliancy of which depend on their nature and physical\r\ncharacter; the light gradually diminishes in intensity during a period\r\nvarying from some seconds to several hours. When these substances are\r\nexposed anew to the action of light, the same effect is reproduced.\r\nThe intensity of the light emitted after insolation is always much less\r\nthan that of the incidental light.” These phenomena appear to have been\r\nfirst observed with precious stones; then, in 1604, in calcined Bologna\r\nstone, and later, in a diamond by Boyle, in 1663; in 1675 it was\r\nnoticed in Baudoin phosphorus (residuum of the calcination of nitrate\r\nof lime), and more recently still in connection with other substances\r\nwhich we will mention. The substances most powerfully influenced by\r\nthe action of light are sulphates of calcium and barium, sulphate of\r\nstrontium, certain kinds of diamonds, and that variety of fluoride of\r\ncalcium, which has received the name of _chlorophane_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.—Artificial flower coated with phosphorescent\r\npowder, exposed to the light of magnesium wire.]\r\n\r\nPhosphorescent sulphate of calcium is prepared by calcining in an\r\nearthenware crucible a mixture of flowers of sulphur and carbonate\r\nof lime. But the preparation only succeeds with carbonate of lime of\r\na particular character. That obtained from the calcination of oyster\r\nshells produces very good results. Three parts of this substance is\r\nmixed with one part of flowers of sulphur, and is made red-hot in a\r\ncrucible covered in from contact with the air. The substance thus\r\nobtained gives, after its insolation, a yellow light in the dark. The\r\nshells of oysters, however, are not always pure, and the result is\r\nsometimes not very satisfactory; it is therefore better to make use of\r\nsome substance whose composition is more to be relied on.\r\n\r\n“When we desire to prepare a phosphorescent sulphate with lime,\r\nor carbonate of lime,” says M. E. Becquerel, “the most suitable\r\nproportions are those which in a hundred parts of the substance are\r\ncomposed of eighty to a hundred of flowers of sulphur in the first\r\ncase, and forty-eight to a hundred in the second, that is, when we\r\nemploy the quantity of sulphur which will be necessary for burning with\r\ncarbonate of lime to produce a monosulphate.[20] It is necessary to\r\nhave regard to the elevation of the temperature in the preparation. By\r\nusing lime procured from arragonite, and reducing the temperature below\r\nfive hundred degrees for a sufficient time for the reaction between the\r\nsulphur and lime to take place, the excess of sulphur is eliminated,\r\nand we have a feebly luminous mass, of a bluish tint; if this mass is\r\nraised to a temperature of eight hundred or nine hundred degrees, it\r\nwill exhibit a very bright light.”\r\n\r\nSulphate of calcium possesses different phosphorescent properties\r\naccording to the nature of the salt which has served to produce the\r\ncarbonate of lime employed. If we transform marble into nitrate of\r\nlime, by dissolving it in water and nitric acid, and form a precipitate\r\nwith carbonate of ammonium, and use the carbonate of lime thus obtained\r\nin the preparation of sulphate of calcium, we have a product which\r\ngives a phosphorescence of a violet-red colour. If the carbonate\r\nof lime used is obtained from chloride of calcium precipitated by\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, the phosphorescence is yellow. If we submit\r\ncarbonate of lime, prepared with lime water and carbonic acid, to the\r\ninfluence of sulphur, we obtain a sulphur giving a phosphorescent\r\nlight of very pure violet. Carbonate of lime obtained by forming a\r\nprecipitate of crystallized chloride of calcium with different alkaline\r\ncarbonates also gives satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nLuminous sulphates of strontium may be obtained, like those of calcium,\r\nby the action of sulphur on strontia or the carbonate of this base, by\r\nthe reduction of sulphates of strontia with charcoal. Blue and green\r\nshades are the most common. Sulphates of barium also present very\r\nremarkable phenomena of phosphorescence; but to obtain very luminous\r\nintensity a higher temperature is needed than with the other substances\r\nmentioned, and we have the same result when we reduce native sulphate\r\nof baryta with charcoal; that is to say, when the reaction takes\r\nplace which produces the phosphorus formerly known as _phosphorus of\r\nBologna_. Preparations obtained from baryta have a phosphorescence\r\nvarying from orange-red to green.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of such substances as we have just enumerated afford an\r\neasy explanation of the method of manufacturing the luminous flowers\r\nwhich we described at the commencement of this chapter. We obtain\r\nsome artificial flowers, cover them with some liquid gum, sprinkle\r\nwith phosphorescent sulphur, and let them dry. The pulverulent matter\r\nthen adheres to them securely, and it is only necessary to expose the\r\nflowers thus prepared to the light of the sun, or the rays emanating\r\nfrom magnesium wire in a state of combustion (fig. 319), to produce\r\nimmediate phosphorescent effects. If taken into a dark room (fig. 320)\r\nthey shine with great brilliancy, and give off very exquisite coloured\r\nrays. Phosphorescent sulphates are used also in tracing names or\r\ndesigns on a paper surface, etc., and it can easily be conceived that\r\nsuch experiments may be infinitely varied according to the pleasure of\r\nthe experimenter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.—Phosphorescent flower emitting light in a dark\r\nroom.]\r\n\r\nBut let us ask ourselves if these substances are not capable of\r\nbeing put to more serious uses, and of being classed among useful\r\nproducts. To this we can reply very decidedly in the affirmative. With\r\nphosphorescent matter we can obtain luminous faces for clocks placed\r\nin dark, obscure spots, and it is not impossible to use it for making\r\nsign-boards for shops, or numbers of houses, which can be lit up at\r\nnight. Professor Norton even goes so far as to propose in the “Journal\r\nof the Franklin Institute,” not only coating the walls of rooms with\r\nthese phosphorescent substances, but also the fronts of houses, when he\r\nconsiders it would be possible to do away entirely with street lights,\r\nthe house-fronts absorbing sufficient light during the day to remain\r\nluminous the whole of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY APPLIED TO SLEIGHT OF HAND.\r\n\r\nWhile physics has provided the species of entertainment called “sleight\r\nof hand” with a number of interesting effects, chemistry has only\r\noffered it very feeble contributions. Robert Houdin formerly made use\r\nof electricity to move the hands of his magic clock, and the electric\r\nmagnet in making an iron box so heavy instantaneously that no one\r\ncould lift it. Robin has made use of optics to produce the curious\r\nspectacle of the decapitated man, spectres, etc. Those persons who are\r\nfond of this kind of amusement may, however, borrow from chemistry\r\nsome original experiments, which can be easily undertaken, and I will\r\nconclude this chapter by describing a juggling feat which I have seen\r\nrecently executed before a numerous audience by a very clever conjuror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.—Amusing experiment in chemistry.]\r\n\r\nThe operator took a glass that was perfectly transparent, and placed\r\nit on a table, announcing that he should cover the glass with a\r\nsaucer, and then, retiring to some distance, would fill it with the\r\nsmoke from a cigarette. And this he carried out exactly, standing\r\nsmoking his cigarette in the background, while the glass, as though\r\nby enchantment, slowly filled with the fumes of the smoke. This trick\r\nis easily accomplished. It is only necessary to pour previously into\r\nthe glass two or three drops of hydrochloric acid, and to moisten the\r\nbottom of the saucer with a few drops of ammonia. These two liquids\r\nare unperceived by the spectators, but as soon as the saucer is placed\r\nover the glass, they unite in forming white fumes of hydrochlorate of\r\nammonia, which bear a complete resemblance to the smoke of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThis experiment excited the greatest astonishment among the spectators\r\npresent on the occasion, but understanding something of chemistry\r\nmyself, I easily guessed at the solution of the mystery. The same\r\nresult is obtained in a course of chemistry in a more simple manner,\r\nand without any attempt at trickery, by placing the opening of a\r\nbottle of ammonia against the opening of another bottle containing\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] It is the same with a number of other common products, such as\r\nclay, sandstone, etc., the composition of which chemistry has revealed.\r\nArgil, or clay, slate, and schist all contain a metal—_aluminium_,\r\nwhich has become most valuable for industrial purposes. Stones\r\nfor building are composed of a metal combined with carbon and\r\noxygen—_calcium_; sandstone is composed of _silicium_, a metallic body\r\nunited with oxygen; and sulphate of magnesia, which enters into the\r\ncomposition of a purgative drink, also contains a metal—_magnesium_.\r\n\r\n[20] These substances must be finely powdered and thoroughly mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n CHEMISTRY AND ALCHEMY—CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS—THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in the foregoing pages given some experiments, and considered\r\nseveral of the metals, but there are numerous very interesting subjects\r\nstill remaining; indeed, the number is so great that we can only\r\npick and choose. All people are desirous to hear something of the\r\natmosphere, of water, and the earth; and as we proceed to speak of\r\ncrystals and minerals, and so on to geology, we shall learn a good\r\ndeal respecting our globe—its conformation and constituents. But the\r\natmospheric air must be treated of first. This will lead us to speak of\r\noxygen and nitrogen. Water will serve to introduce hydrogen with a few\r\nexperiments, and thus we shall have covered a good deal of ground on\r\nour way towards various other elements in daily use and appreciation.\r\nNow let us begin with a few words concerning CHEMISTRY itself.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset we are obliged to grope in the dark after the origin\r\nof this fascinating science. Shem, or “Chem,” the son of Noah, has\r\nbeen credited with its introduction, and, at any rate, magicians were\r\nin Egypt in the time of Moses, and the lawgiver is stated by ancient\r\nwriters to have gained his knowledge from the Egyptians. But we need\r\nnot pursue that line of argument. In more modern times the search for\r\nthe Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life, which respectively\r\nturned everything to gold, and bestowed long life upon the fortunate\r\nfinder, occupied many people, who in their researches no doubt\r\ndiscovered the germs of the popular science of Chemistry in Alchemy,\r\nwhile the pursuit took a firm hold of the popular imagination for\r\ncenturies; and even now chemistry is the most favoured science, because\r\nof its adaptability to all minds, for it holds plain and simple truths\r\nfor our every-day experience to confirm, while it leads us step by step\r\ninto the infinite, pleasing us with experiments as we proceed.\r\n\r\nAlchemy was practised by numerous quacks in ancient times and the\r\nMiddle Ages, but all its professors were not quacks. Astrology and\r\nalchemy were associated by the Arabians. Geber was a philosopher who\r\ndevoted himself entirely to alchemy, and who lived in the year 730\r\nA.D. He fancied gold would cure all disease, and he did\r\nactually discover corrosive sublimate, nitric acid, and nitrate of\r\nsilver. To give even a list of the noted alchemists and magicians would\r\nfill too much space. Raymond Sully, Paracelsus, Friar Bacon, Albertus\r\nMagnus, Thomas Aquinas, Flamel, Bernard of Treves, Doctor Dee, with his\r\nassistant Kelly, and in later times Jean Delisle, and Joseph Balsamo\r\n(Cagliostro), who was one of the most notorious persons in Europe about\r\none hundred years ago (1765-1789), are names taken at random; and with\r\nthe older philosophers chemistry was an all-absorbing occupation—not\r\nfor gold, but knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe revelation was slow. On the temperature of bodies the old arts\r\nof healing were based—for chemistry and medicine were allies. The\r\nelements, we read, existed on the supposition “that bodies were hot\r\nor cold, dry or moist”; and on this distinction for a long time “was\r\nbased the practice of medicine.” The doctrine of the “three principles”\r\nof existence superseded this,—the principles being salt, mercury, and\r\nsulphur. Metals had been regarded as living bodies, gases as souls or\r\nspirits. The idea remained that the _form_ of the substance gave it its\r\ncharacter. Acid was pointed; sweet things were round.\r\n\r\nChemistry, then, has had a great deal to contend against. From the\r\ntime of the Egyptians and Chinese, who were evidently acquainted with\r\nvarious processes,—dyeing, etc.,—the science filtered through the\r\nalchemists to Beecher and Stahl, and then the principle of affinity—a\r\ndisposition to combine—was promulgated, supplemented in 1674 by\r\nMayow, by the theory of divorce or analysis. He concluded that where\r\nunion could be effected, separation was equally possible. In 1718 the\r\nfirst “Table of Affinities” was produced. Affinity had been shown\r\nto be _elective_, for Mayow pointed out that fixed salts chose one\r\nacid rather than another. Richter and Dalton made great advances.\r\nBefore them Hales, Black, Priestley, Scheele, Lavoisier, and numerous\r\nothers penetrated the mysteries of the science whose history has been\r\npleasantly written by more than one author who we have not been able\r\nto consult, and have no space to do more than indicate. In later days\r\nFaraday, De la Rive, Roscoe, and many others have rendered chemistry\r\nmuch more popular, while they have added to its treasures. The story\r\nof the progress of chemistry would fill a large volume, and we have\r\nregretfully to put aside the introduction and pass on.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to investigate the elements, a few words concerning\r\nthe general terms used in chemistry will be beneficial to the reader.\r\nIf we look at the list of the elements, pp. 308-9, we shall see\r\nvarious terminations. Some are apparently named from places, some from\r\ntheir characteristics. Metals lately discovered by the spectroscope\r\n(and recently) end in _ium_; some end in “ine,” some in “on.” As far\r\nas possible in late years a certain system of nomenclature has been\r\nadhered to, but the old popular names have not been interfered with.\r\n\r\nWhen elements combine together in certain proportions of each they\r\nreceive certain names. The following table will explain the terms used;\r\nfor instance, we find that—\r\n\r\n  Compounds of Oxygen   are termed Oxides, as oxide of copper.\r\n     ”         Hydrogen      ”     Hydrides, as hydride of potassium.\r\n     ”         Chlorine      ”     Chlorides, as chloride of sodium.\r\n     ”         Nitrogen      ”     Nitrides, as nitride of boron.\r\n     ”         Bromine       ”     Bromides, as bromide of potassium.\r\n     ”         Iodine        ”     Iodides, as iodide of potassium.\r\n     ”         Sulphur       ”     Sulphides, or}\r\n                                     Sulphurets,} as sulphuret of lead.\r\n     ”         Selenium      ”     Selenides, as selenide of mercury.\r\n     ”         Carbon        ”     Carbides, or} as carbide of nitrogen,\r\n                                     Carburets,} and so on.\r\n\r\nThe above examples refer to the union in single proportion of each, and\r\nare called Binary Compounds. When more than one atom of each element\r\nexists in different proportions we have different terms to express\r\nsuch union. If one atom of oxygen be in the compound it is called\r\na “monoxide” or “protoxide”; two atoms of oxygen in combination is\r\ntermed “dioxide” or “binoxide”; three, “trioxide,” or “tritoxide”;\r\nfour is the “tetroxide” or “per-oxide,” etc. When more than one\r\natom, but not two atoms is involved, we speak of the _sesqui_-oxide\r\n(one-and-a-half),—“oxide” being interchangeable for “sulphide” or\r\n“chloride,” according to the element.\r\n\r\nThere are other distinctions adopted when metals form two series of\r\ncombinations, such as _ous_ and _ic_, which apply, as will be seen, to\r\nacids. Sulphur_ic_ and sulphur_ous_ acids, nitr_ic_ and nitr_ous_ acid\r\nare familiar examples. In these cases we shall find that in the acids\r\nending in “ous” oxygen is present in less quantity than in the acids\r\nending in _ic_. The symbolic form will prove this directly, the number\r\nof atoms of oxygen being written below,\r\n\r\n  Sulphurous Acid = H_{2} SO_{3}.     Nitrous Acid = HNO_{2}.\r\n  Sulphuric Acid = H_{2}SO_{4}.       Nitric Acid = HNO_{3}.\r\n\r\nWhenever a stronger compound of oxygen is discovered than that\r\ndenominated by _ic_, chemists adopt the plan of dubbing it the _per_\r\n(ὑπέρ over), as per-chloric acid, which possesses four atoms of oxygen\r\n(HClO_{4}), chloric acid being HClO_{3}. The opposite Greek term,\r\nὑπὸ (_hupo_, below), is used for an acid with less than two atoms\r\nof oxygen, and in books is written “hypo”-chlorous (for instance).\r\nCare has been taken to distinguish between the higher and lower; for\r\n“_hyper_” is used in English to denote excess, as hyper-critical; and\r\n_hypo_ might to a reader unacquainted with the derivation convey just\r\nthe opposite meaning to what is intended.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of these terminations we may show how these distinctive\r\nendings are carried out. We shall find, if we pursue the subject, that\r\nwhen we have a salt of any acid ending in _ic_ the salt terminates in\r\n“_ate_.” Similarly the salts of acids ending in _ous_, end in “_ite_.”\r\nTo continue the same example we have—\r\n\r\n  Sulphur_ous_ Acid, which forms salts called Sulph_ites_.\r\n  Sulphur_ic_ Acid,       ”           ”       Sulph_ates_.\r\n\r\nBesides these are sulph_ides_, which are results of the unions or\r\ncompounds of elementary bodies. Sulph_ites_ are more complicated\r\nunions of the compounds. Sulphates are the salts formed by the union\r\nof sulphuric acid with bases. Sulphides or sulphurets are compounds in\r\nwhich sulphur forms the electro-negative element, and sulphites are\r\nsalts formed by the union of sulphur_ous_ acids with bases, or by their\r\naction upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.—Combinations of elements.]\r\n\r\nThe symbolical nomenclature of the chemist is worse than Greek to the\r\nuninitiated. We frequently see in so-called popular chemical books a\r\nnumber of hieroglyphics and combinations of letters with figures very\r\ndifficult to decipher, much less to interpret. These symbols take the\r\nplace of the names of the chemical compounds. Thus water is made up of\r\noxygen and hydrogen in certain proportions; that is, two of hydrogen to\r\none of oxygen. The symbolic reading is simple, H_{2}O, = the oxide of\r\nhydrogen. Potassium again mingles with oxygen. Potassium is K in our\r\nlist; KO is oxide of potassium (potash). Let us look into this a little\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\nThe union of one particle of a simple body with a particle of another\r\nsimple body can be easily understood; but, as we have seen, it is\r\npossible to have substances consisting of four or five different\r\nparticles, though the greater number of chemical combinations consist\r\nof two or three dissimilar ones. In the diagram (fig. 322) we have some\r\npossible combinations.\r\n\r\nIn these combinations we may have one particle of _a_ in combination\r\nwith one, two, three, four, or five of _b_, and many particles of _a_\r\ncan unite with various molecules of _b_. Suppose we have oxygen and\r\nsulphur compounds as follows:—\r\n\r\nThus there are three different compounds of these two elements—SO,\r\nSO_{2}, SO_{3} (without water).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) (2) (3)\r\n\r\nFig. 323.-(1) Hydrosulphurous Acid. (2) Sulphurous Acid. (3) Sulphuric\r\nAcid.]\r\n\r\nA compound body may combine with another compound body, and this\r\nmakes a complicated compound. Suppose we have a mixture of sulphuric\r\nacid and potash. We have a sulphate of potassium (K_{2}SO_{4}) and\r\ncombinations of these combinations may likewise be formed. We must\r\nread these symbols by the light of the combining weights given in the\r\ntable, and then we shall find the weight of oxygen or other elements\r\nin combination. Thus when we see a certain symbol (Hg.S for instance),\r\nwe understand that they form a compound including so many parts of\r\nmercury and so many of sulphur, which is known as vermilion. Hg.O is\r\noxide of mercury, and by reference to the table of Atomic Weights, we\r\nfind mercury is Hg., and its combining weight is 200; while oxygen is\r\nO, and its weight is 16. Thus we see at once how much of each element\r\nis contained in oxide of mercury, and this proportion never varies;\r\nthere must be 200 of one and 16 of the other, by weight, to produce the\r\noxide. So if the oxygen has to be separated from it, the sum of 216\r\nparts must be taken to procure the 16 parts of oxygen. When we see, as\r\nabove, O_{2} or O_{3}, we know that the weight must be calculated twice\r\nor three times, O being 16; O_{2} is therefore 32 parts by weight. So\r\nwhen we have found what the compounds consist of, we can write them\r\nsymbolically with ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR.\r\n\r\nWe have already communicated a variety of facts concerning the air.\r\nWe have seen that it possesses pressure and weight. We call the\r\ngaseous envelope of the earth the atmosphere, and we are justified in\r\nconcluding that other planets possess an atmosphere also, though of a\r\ndifferent nature to ours. We have seen how easy it is to weigh the air,\r\nbut we may repeat the experiment. (_See_ illustration, fig. 45, page\r\n50.) We shall find that a perfectly empty glass globe will balance the\r\nweights in the scale-pan; admit the air, and the glass globe will sink.\r\nSo air possesses weight. We have mentioned the Magdeburg hemispheres,\r\nthe barometer, the air-pump, and the height and the pressure of the\r\natmosphere have been indicated. The density of the atmosphere decreases\r\nas we ascend; for the first seven miles the density diminishes\r\none-fourth that of the air at the sea-level, and so on for every\r\nsucceeding seven.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the equal, if enormous, pressure exercised in every\r\ndirection, we do not perceive the inconvenience, but if the air were\r\nremoved from inside of a drum, the parchment would quickly collapse.\r\nWe feel the air when we move rapidly. We breathe the air, and that\r\nstatement brings us to consider the composition of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich, _chemically_ speaking, _may vary a little_ (as compared with\r\nthe whole mass) in consequence of changes which are continually taking\r\nplace, but to all intents and purposes the air is composed as follows,\r\nin 100 parts:\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen          79 parts.\r\n  Oxygen            20   ”\r\n  Carbonic Acid    .04   ”\r\n\r\nwith minute quantities of other ingredients, such as ammonia, iodine,\r\ncarbonetted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, nitric\r\nacid, carbonic oxide, and dust particles, as visible in the sunbeams,\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThe true composition of the atmosphere was not known till Lavoisier\r\ndemonstrated that it consisted of two gases, one of which was the vital\r\nfluid, or oxygen, discovered by Priestley. To the other gas Lavoisier\r\ngave the name of Azote,—an enemy of life,—because it caused death if\r\ninhaled alone. The carbonic acid in the air varies very much, and in\r\nclose, heated, and crowded rooms increases to a large quantity, which\r\ncauses lassitude and headache.\r\n\r\nWe can easily prove the existence of carbonic acid gas as exhaled\r\nfrom the lungs. Suppose we take a glass and fill it partly with clear\r\nlime-water; breathe through a glass tube into the water in the glass,\r\nand very quickly you will perceive that the lime-water is becoming\r\ncloudy and turbid. This cloudiness is due to the presence of chalk,\r\nwhich has been produced by the action of the carbonic acid gas in the\r\nlime-water. This is a well known and always interesting experiment,\r\nbecause it leads up to the vital question of our existence, and the\r\nfunctions of breathing and living.\r\n\r\nA popular writer once wrote a book entitled, “Is Life Worth Living?”\r\nand a witty commentator replied to the implied question by saying, “It\r\ndepends upon the _liver_.” This was felt to be true by many people who\r\nsuffer, but the scientific man will go farther, and tell you it depends\r\nupon the air you breathe, and on the carbonic acid you can raise to\r\ncreate heat,—animal heat,—which is so essential to our well-being.\r\nWe are always burning; a furnace is within us, never ceasing to burn\r\nwithout visible combustion. We are generating heat by means of the\r\nblood. We know that we inhale air into the lungs, and probably are\r\naware that the air so received parts with the oxygen to renew the\r\nblood. The nitrogen dilutes the oxygen, for if we inhaled a less-mixed\r\nair we should either be burnt up or become lunatics, as light-headed\r\nas when inhaling “laughing-gas.” This beautifully graduated mixture is\r\ntaken into our bodies, the oxygen renews the blood and gives it its\r\nbright red colour; the carbon which exists in all our bodies is cold\r\nand dead when not so vivified by oxygen. The carbonic acid given off\r\nproduces heat, and our bodies are warm. But when the action ceases we\r\nbecome cold, we die away, and cease to live. Man’s life exemplifies\r\na taper burning; the carbon waste is consumed as the wax is, and\r\nwhen the candle burns away—it dies! It is a beautiful study, full of\r\nsuggestiveness to all who care to study the great facts of Nature,\r\nwhich works by the same means in all matter. We will refer to plants\r\npresently, after having proved by experiment the existence of nitrogen\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nRutherford experimented very cruelly upon a bird, which he placed\r\nbeneath a glass shade, and there let it remain in the carbonic acid\r\nexhaled from its lungs, till the oxygen being at length all consumed\r\nby the bird, it died. When the atmosphere had been chemically purified\r\nby a solution of caustic potash, another bird was introduced, but\r\nthough it lived for some time, it did not exist so long as the first.\r\nAgain the air was deprived of the carbonic acid, and a third bird was\r\nintroduced. The experiment was thus repeated, till at length a bird\r\nwas placed beneath the receiver, and it perished at once. This is at\r\nonce a cruel and clumsy method of making an experiment, which can be\r\nmore pleasantly and satisfactorily practised by burning some substance\r\nin the air beneath the glass. Phosphorus, having a great affinity for\r\noxygen, is usually chosen. The experiment can be performed as follows\r\nwith a taper, but the phosphorus is a better exponent.\r\n\r\nLet us take a shallow basin with some water in it, a cork or small\r\nplate floating upon the water, and in the plate a piece of phosphorus.\r\nWe must be careful how we handle phosphorus, for it has a habit, well\r\nknown, but sometimes forgotten by amateur chemists, of suddenly taking\r\nfire. Light this piece of phosphorus,—a small piece will do if the jar\r\nbe of average “shade” size,—and place the glass over it, as in the\r\nillustration (fig. 325). The smoke will quickly spread in the jar, and\r\nthe entry of air being prevented, because the jar is resting under\r\nwater, phosphoric acid will be formed, and the oxygen thereby consumed.\r\nThe water, meanwhile, will rise in the jar, the pressure of the air\r\nbeing removed. The burning phosphorus will soon go out, and when the\r\nglass is cool, you will be able to ascertain what is inside the jar.\r\nPut a lighted taper underneath, and it will go out. The taper would\r\nnot go out before the phosphorus was burnt in the glass, and so now we\r\nperceive we have azote in the receptacle—that is, nitrogen. The other,\r\nthe constituent of our atmosphere, carbonic acid, as we have seen, is\r\nvery injurious to the life of animals, and as every animal breathes\r\nit out into the air, what becomes of it? Where does all this enormous\r\nvolume of carbonic acid, the quantities of this poison which are daily\r\nand nightly exhaled, where do they all go to? We may be sure nature has\r\nprovided for the safe disposal of it all. Not only because we live and\r\nmove about still,—and of course that is a proof,—but because nature\r\nalways has a compensating law. Remember _nothing is wasted_; not even\r\nthe refuse, poisonous air we get rid of from our lungs. Where does it\r\ngo?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 324.—Rutherford’s experiment.]\r\n\r\nIt goes to nourish the plants and trees and vegetables that we delight\r\nto look upon and to eat the fruit of. Thus the vegetable world forms a\r\nlink between the animals and the minerals. Vegetables obtain food, so\r\nto speak, and nourishment from water, ammonia, and carbonic acid, all\r\ncompound bodies, but inorganic.\r\n\r\nWater consists of oxygen and hydrogen, carbonic acid of carbon and\r\noxygen, and ammonia of hydrogen and nitrogen. Water and ammonia are\r\npresent in the air; so are oxygen and nitrogen. Water falls in the\r\nform of rain, dew, etc. So in the atmosphere around us we find nearly\r\nevery necessary for plant-life; and in the ground, which supplies some\r\nmetallic oxides for their use, we find the remainder. From the air,\r\nthen, the plant derives its life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325—Drawing the oxygen from air by combustion.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom in turn gives all animals their food. This you\r\nwill see at a glance is true. Certainly animals live on animals. Man\r\nand wilder animals live on the beasts of the field in a measure, but\r\nthose beasts derive their nourishment from vegetables—the vegetable\r\nkingdom. So we live on the vegetable kingdom, and it separates the\r\ncarbonic acid from the air, and absorbs it. What we do not want it\r\ntakes. What we want it gives. Vegetables give out oxygen, and we\r\nconsume it gladly. We throw away carbonic acid, and the plants take\r\nit greedily; and thus the atmosphere is retained pure for our use. We\r\ncan, if desirable, prove that plants absorb carbonic acid and give\r\nout oxygen by placing leaves of a plant in water, holding the acid in\r\nsolution, and let the sun shine upon them. Before long we shall find\r\nthat the carbonic acid has disappeared, and that oxygen has come into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is sufficiently heavy to be poured from one vessel to\r\nanother; and if we have obtained some in a glass, we can extinguish a\r\ntaper by pouring the invisible gas on to the lighted taper, when it\r\nwill be immediately extinguished.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations it will be perceived how very desirable\r\nit is that ventilation should be attended to. People close up windows\r\nand doors and fireplaces, and go to bed and sleep. In the morning\r\nthey complain of headache and lassitude; they wonder what is the\r\nmatter, and why the children are not well. Simply because they have\r\nbeen rebreathing the carbonic acid. Go into a closed railway carriage\r\nwhich is nearly filled (and it is astonishing to us how people can be\r\nso foolish as to close every outlet), and you will recoil in disgust.\r\nThese travellers shut the ventilators and windows “because of the\r\ncold.” A very small aperture will ventilate a railway carriage; but a\r\nclose carriage is sickening and enervating, as these kind of travellers\r\nfind out by the time they reach their journey’s end. Air was given us\r\nto breathe at night as well as by day; and though from man’s acts or\r\nomissions there may be circumstances in which “night” air may affect\r\nthe health, we maintain that air is no more injurious naturally than\r\n“day” air. Colder it may be, but any air at night is “night” air, in\r\nor out of doors at night; and we are certain that night air in itself\r\nnever hurt any healthy person. It is not nature’s plan to destroy, but\r\nto save. If a person delicate in constitution gets hot, and comes out\r\ninto a colder atmosphere, and defy nature in that way, he (or she)\r\nmust take the consequences. But air and _ventilation_ (not draught)\r\nare necessaries of health, and to say they injure is to accuse nature\r\nfalsely. There are many impurities in the air in cities, and in country\r\nplaces sometimes, but such impurities are owing to man’s acts and\r\nomissions. With average sanitary arrangements and appliances in a\r\nneighbourhood no one need be afraid to breathe fresh air night or day;\r\nand while many invalids have, we believe, been retarded in recovery\r\nfrom being kept in a close room, hundreds will be benefited by plenty\r\nof fresh air. We should not so insist upon these plain and simple\r\ntruths were there not so many individuals who think it beneficial to\r\nclose up every avenue by which air can enter, and who then feel ill and\r\nout of spirits, blaming everything but their own short-sightedness for\r\nthe effect of their own acts. An inch or two of a window may be open\r\nat night in a room, as the chimney register should be always fully up\r\nin bedrooms. When there are fires the draught supplies fresh air to\r\nthe room with sufficient rapidity. But many seaside journeys might be\r\navoided if fresh air were insisted on at home.\r\n\r\nThere is another and an important constituent of the atmosphere called\r\nOZONE, which is very superior oxygen, or oxygen in what is\r\ntermed the “Allotropic” state, and is distantly related to electricity,\r\ninasmuch as it can be produced by an electrical discharge. This partly\r\naccounts for the freshness in the air after a thunderstorm, for we\r\nare all conscious that the storm has “cleared the air.” The fresh,\r\ncrisp ozone in the atmosphere is evident. Ozone differs from oxygen\r\nin possessing taste and smell, and it is heavier by one-half than the\r\noxygen gas. There is a good deal of ozone in the sea breeze, and we\r\ncan, though not infallibly, detect its presence by test-paper prepared\r\nwith iodide of potassium, which, when ozone is present, will turn\r\nblue. We have still something to learn about ozone, which may be\r\nconsidered as “condensed oxygen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326. Development of gas by combustion. Fig. 327.]\r\n\r\nWe have frequently mentioned “combustion,” and as under ordinary\r\ncircumstances such effects cannot take place without atmospheric air,\r\nwe will consider it. Combustion is chemical action accompanied by\r\nlight and heat. Chemical union is always attended by the development\r\nof heat, not always by light, because the union varies in intensity\r\nand quickness. But when a candle is burning we can study all the\r\ninteresting phenomena of combustion. We have already spoken of HEAT\r\nand LIGHT, so we need only refer the readers to those subjects in the\r\nformer parts of this volume. Heat is referable to chemical action,\r\nand varies according to the energy of union. Heat is always present,\r\nremember, in a greater or less degree; and when visible combustion\r\ntakes place we see light. Invisible combustion goes on in our bodies,\r\nand we feel heat; when we get cold we feed the fire by eating, or blow\r\nit by exercise and air in our lungs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328.—Gas evolved from flame.]\r\n\r\nWe shall speak, however, of combustion now as it affects us in daily\r\nlife; our fires, our candles, gas, etc., and under these ordinary\r\ncircumstances hydrogen and carbon are present. (We shall hear more\r\nabout carbon presently.) These unite with the oxygen to form water and\r\ncarbonic acid; the water being visible as we first put the cold shade\r\nupon the lighted lamp, and the carbonic acid renders the air impure.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a common candle, or lamp, combustion takes place in the\r\nsame way. The wick is the intermediary. The oil mounts in the lamp\r\nwick, where it is converted into a gas by heat; it then “takes fire,”\r\nand gives us light and heat. The candle-flame is just the same with\r\none exception: the burning material is solid, not liquid, though the\r\ndifference is only apparent, for the wax is melted and goes up as gas.\r\nThe burning part of the wick has a centre where there is no combustion,\r\nand contains carbon. We can prove this by placing a bent tube, as in\r\nthe illustration (fig. 326), one end in the unburning part of the\r\nflame. We shall soon see a dark vapour come over into the receiver.\r\nThis is combustible, for if we raise the tube without the glass we can\r\nlight the gas (fig. 327). If we insert the end of the tube into the\r\nbrilliant portion of the flame we shall perceive a black vapour, which\r\nwill extinguish the combustion, for it is a mixture of carbonic acid\r\ngas and aqueous vapour, in which (fig. 328) particles of carbon are\r\nfloating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329.—Davy’s safety lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330.—Davy lamp (section).]\r\n\r\nWhen we proceed to light our lamps to read or to write by, we find some\r\ndifficulty in making the wick burn at first. We present to it a lighted\r\ntaper, and it has no immediate effect. Here we have oil and cotton,\r\ntwo things which would speedily set a warehouse in flames from top to\r\nbottom, but we cannot even ignite them, try all we can. Why?—Because we\r\nmust first obtain a gas, oil will not burn liquid; it must be heated\r\nto a gaseous point before it will burn, as all combustion depends upon\r\nthat,—so flames mount high in air. Now in a candle-flame, as will be\r\nseen in the diagram (fig. 331.), there are three portions,—the inner\r\ndark core, which consists of unburnt gas; the outer flame, which gives\r\nlight; and the outside rim of perfect combustion non-luminous. In the\r\ncentre, A, there is no heat. If we place a piece of gauze wire over the\r\nflame at a little distance the flame will not penetrate it. It will\r\nremain underneath, because the wire, being of metal, quickly absorbs\r\nthe heat, and consequently there is no flame. This idea led to the\r\ninvention of the “safety” lamp by Sir Humphrey Davy, which, although it\r\nis not infallible, is the only lamp in general use in mines (figs. 329,\r\n330).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.—Construction of a candle flame.]\r\n\r\nMines must have light, but there is a gas in mines, a “marsh” gas,\r\nwhich becomes very explosive when it mixes with oxygen. Of course the\r\ngas will be harmless till it meets oxygen, but, in its efforts to meet,\r\nit explodes the moment the union takes place; instead of burning slowly\r\nlike a candle it goes off all at once. This gas, called “fire damp,” is\r\ncarburetted hydrogen, and when it explodes it develops into carbonic\r\nacid gas, which suffocates the miners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.—Pouring carbonic acid on a lighted taper.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nNON-METALLIC ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYGEN—SYMBOL =O=; ATOMIC WEIGHT 16.\r\n\r\nOxygen is certainly the most abundant element in nature. It exists all\r\naround us, and the animal and vegetable worlds are dependent upon it.\r\nIt constitutes in combination about one-half of the crust of the earth,\r\nand composes eight-ninths of its weight of water. It is a gas without\r\ntaste or colour. Oxygen was discovered by Priestley and Scheele, in\r\n1774, independently of each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.—Oxygen from oxide of mercury.]\r\n\r\nOxygen can be procured from the oxides of the metals, particularly from\r\ngold, silver, and platinum. The noble metals are reducible from their\r\noxides by heat, and this fact assists us at once. If we heat chlorate\r\nof potash, mixed with binoxide of manganese, in a retort in a furnace,\r\nthe gas will be given off. There are many other ways of obtaining\r\noxygen, and we illustrate two (figs. 333, 335).\r\n\r\nThe red oxide of mercury will very readily evolve oxygen, and if we\r\nheat a small quantity of the compound in a retort as per illustration\r\n(fig. 333) we shall get the gas. In a basin of water we place a tube\r\ntest-glass, and the gas from the retort will pass over and collect in\r\nthe test tube, driving out the water.\r\n\r\nThe other method mentioned above,—viz., by heating chlorate of potash,\r\netc., in a furnace, is shown in the following illustration. Oxygen, as\r\nwe have said, is a colourless and inodorous gas, and for a long time\r\nit could not be obtained in any other form; but lately both oxygen and\r\nhydrogen have been liquified under tremendous pressure at a very low\r\ntemperature. Oxygen causes any red-hot substance plunged into it to\r\nburn brightly; a match will readily inflame if a spark be remaining,\r\nwhile phosphorus is exceedingly brilliant, and these appearances, with\r\nmany others equally striking, are caused by the affinity for those\r\nsubstances possessed by the gas. Combustion is merely oxidation, just\r\nas the process of rusting is, only in the latter case the action is so\r\nslow that no sensible heat is produced. But when an aggregate of slowly\r\noxidising masses are heaped together, heat is generated, and at length\r\nbursts into flame. This phenomenon is called “spontaneous combustion.”\r\nCases have been known in which the gases developed in the human body by\r\nthe abuse of alcoholic drinks have ended fatally; in like manner the\r\nbody being completely charred. (Combustion must not be confounded with\r\n_ignition_, as in the electric light.) Oxygen then, we see, is a great\r\nsupporter of combustion, though not a combustible itself as coal is.\r\nWhen the chemical union of oxygen with another substance is very rapid\r\nan explosion takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.—Showing retort placed in furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335.—The generation of oxygen from oxide of\r\nmanganese and potash.]\r\n\r\nOxidation occurs in various ways. Besides those already mentioned,\r\nall verdigris produced on copper, all decays of whatever kind,\r\ndisintegration, and respiration, are the effects of oxygen. The\r\nfollowing experiment for the extraction of oxygen directly from the air\r\nwas made by M. Boussingault, who passed the gas upon a substance at a\r\ncertain temperature, and released it at a higher. The illustration on\r\npage 351 will show the way in which the experiment was performed.\r\n\r\nBoussingault permitted a thin stream of water to flow into a large\r\nempty flask, and by this water the air was gradually driven out into\r\na flask containing chloride of calcium and sulphuric acid, which\r\neffectually dried it. This dry air then passed into a large tube inside\r\nthe reverberatory furnace, in which tube were pieces of caustic baryta.\r\nHeated to a dull redness this absorbs oxygen, and when the heat is\r\nincreased to a bright red the superabundant gas is given off. Thus the\r\noxygen was permitted to pass from the furnace-tube into the receiving\r\nglass, and so pure oxygen was obtained from the air which had been in\r\nthe glass bottle at first (fig. 338).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336.—Phosphorus burning in oxygen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN—SYMBOL =H=; ATOMIC WEIGHT 1.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is abundant in nature, but never free. United with oxygen it\r\nforms water, hence its name, “water-former.” It is to Parcelcus that\r\nits discovery is due, for he found that oil of vitriol in contact with\r\niron disengaged a gas which was a constituent of water. This gas was\r\nsubsequently found to be inflammable, but it is to Cavendish that the\r\nreal explanation of hydrogen is owing. He explained his views in 1766.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is obtained in the manner illustrated in the cut, by means of\r\na furnace, as in fig. 339, or by the bottle method, as per fig. 340.\r\nThe first method is less convenient than the second. A gun-barrel or\r\nfire-proof tube is passed through the furnace, and filled with iron\r\nnails or filings; a delivery tube is at the farther end, and a flask\r\nof water boiling at the other. The oxygen combines with the iron in\r\nthe tube, and the hydrogen passes over. The second method is easily\r\narranged. A flask, as in the cut, is provided, and in it some zinc\r\nshavings are put. Diluted sulphuric acid is then poured upon the metal.\r\nSulphate of zinc is formed in the flask, and the hydrogen passes off.\r\n\r\nHydrogen being the lightest of all known bodies, its weight is put\r\nas 1, and thus we are relatively with it enabled to write down the\r\nweights of all the other elements. Hydrogen is fourteen-and-a-half\r\ntimes lighter than atmospheric air, and would do admirably for the\r\ninflation of balloons were it not so expensive to procure in such large\r\nquantities as would be necessary. Ordinary coal gas, however, contains\r\na great deal of hydrogen, and answers the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.—Magnesium wire burning in oxygen.]\r\n\r\nA very pretty experiment may be made with a bladder full of hydrogen\r\ngas. If a tube be fitted to the bladder already provided with a\r\nstop-cock, and a basin of ordinary soap-suds be at hand, by dipping the\r\nend of the tube in the solution and gently expressing the gas, bubbles\r\nwill be formed which are of exceeding lightness (fig. 341). They can\r\nalso be fired with a taper.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment may be made with hydrogen as follows:—If we permit\r\nthe gas to escape from the flask, and light it, as in the illustration,\r\nand put a glass over it, we shall obtain a musical note, higher or\r\nlower, according to the length, breadth, and thickness of the open\r\nglass-tube (fig. 342). If a number of different tubes be employed, we\r\ncan obtain a musical instrument—a gas harmonium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338.—Extraction of oxygen from air.]\r\n\r\nHydrogen burns with a blue flame, and is very inflammable. Even water\r\nsprinkled upon a fire will increase its fierceness, because the\r\nhydrogen burns with great heat, and the oxygen is liberated. Being\r\nvery light, H can be transferred from one vessel to another if both\r\nbe held upside down. Some mixtures of H and O are very explosive. The\r\noxyhydrogen blow-pipe is used with a mixture of O and H, which is\r\nforcibly blown through a tube and then ignited. The flame thus produced\r\nhas a most intense heating-power.\r\n\r\nA very easy method of producing hydrogen is to put a piece of sodium\r\ninto an inverted cylinder full of water, standing in a basin of water.\r\nThe sodium liberates the hydrogen by removing the oxygen from the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER—SYMBOL =H_{2}O=; ATOMIC WEIGHT 18.\r\n\r\nAt page 59 of this volume we said something about water, and remarked\r\n(as we have since perceived by experiment) that “water is composed of\r\noxygen and hydrogen in proportions, by weight, of eight of the former\r\nto one of the latter gas; in volume, hydrogen is two to one”; and we\r\nsaw that “volume and weight were very different things.” This we will\r\ndo well to bear in mind, and that, to quote Professor Roscoe, “Water is\r\nalways made up of sixteen parts of oxygen to two parts of hydrogen by\r\nweight”; sixteen and two being eighteen, the combining weight of water\r\nis eighteen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339.—Preparation of hydrogen with furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340.—Apparatus for generating hydrogen by flask.]\r\n\r\nWe can prove by the Eudiometer that hydrogen when burnt with oxygen\r\nforms water; and here we must remark that water is not a mere\r\nmechanical mixture of gases, as air is. Water is the product of\r\nchemical combination, and as we have before said, is really an oxide\r\nof hydrogen, and therefore combustion, or electricity, must be called\r\nto our assistance before we can form water, which is the result of an\r\nexplosion, the mixture meeting with an ignited body—the aqueous vapour\r\nbeing expanded by heat.\r\n\r\nThe ancients supposed water to be a simple body, but Lavoisier and\r\nCavendish demonstrated its true character. Pure water, at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, is devoid of taste and smell, and is a transparent,\r\nnearly colourless, liquid. When viewed in masses it is blue, as\r\nvisible in a marked degree in the Rhone and Rhine, at Geneva, and\r\nBâle respectively. Its specific gravity is 1, and it is taken as the\r\nstandard for Sp. Gravity, as hydrogen is taken as the standard for\r\nAtomic Weight. The uses of water and the very important part it plays\r\nin the arrangements of nature as a mechanical agent, geology can\r\nattest, and meteorology confirm. It composes the greater portions of\r\nanimals and plants; without water the world would be a desert—a dead\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341.—Blowing bubbles with hydrogen gas.]\r\n\r\nWe sometimes speak of “pure” spring water, but such a fluid absolutely\r\npure can scarcely be obtained; and though we can filter water there\r\nwill always remain some foreign substance or substances in solution.\r\nIt is well known that the action of water wears away and rounds off\r\nhard rocks, and this power of disintegration is supplemented by its\r\nstrength as a solvent, which is very great. Rain-water is purest in\r\nthe country as it falls from the clouds. In smoky towns it becomes\r\nsooty and dirty. It is owing to the solvent properties of water,\r\ntherefore, that we have such difficulty in obtaining a pure supply.\r\nThere is _hard_ water and _soft_ water. The former is derived from the\r\ncalcareous formations, and contains lime, like the Kent water. This can\r\nbe ascertained by noticing the incrustations of the vessels wherein the\r\nwater is boiled. But water rising from hard rocks, such as granite, can\r\ndo little to disintegrate them at the moment, and therefore the water\r\nrises purer. Springs from a great depth are warm, and are known as\r\n“thermal springs”; and when they come in contact with carbonic acid and\r\nsome salts in their passage to the surface, they are known as “mineral\r\nwaters.” These waters hold in solution salts of lime and magnesia, or\r\ncarbonates of soda with those of lime and magnesia; salts of iron, and\r\ncompounds of iodine and bromine are found in the natural mineral waters\r\nalso, as well as sulphurous impregnations, instances of which will\r\noccur to every reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342.—Experiment with hydrogen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343.—The composition of water.]\r\n\r\nWe mentioned the Eudiometer just now, and we give an illustration of\r\nit. This instrument is used to ascertain the proportions in which the\r\nelements of water are composed by _synthesis_, or a putting together of\r\nthe constituents of a body to make it up. This is distinguished from\r\n_analysis_, which means separating the compound body into its elements,\r\nas we do when we pass the electric current through water.\r\n\r\nThe Eudiometer consists of a stout glass tube sealed hermetically at\r\none end; two platinum wires are pushed in through the glass just before\r\nthe end is sealed. The tube is now filled with mercury, and inverted\r\nin a bowl of the same metal. Hydrogen, and then oxygen, are admitted\r\nthrough the mercury in the recognised proportions of two to one. By\r\nthe time the mercury is somewhat more than half displaced, the tube\r\nshould be held upon a sheet of india-rubber at the bottom of the\r\nvessel to keep the metal in the tube, for when the necessary explosion\r\ntakes place the mercury might also be driven out. A spark from the\r\nelectrophorus or from a Leyden jar may now be passed through the gases\r\nin the tube. The explosion occurs, and water is formed inside. If the\r\nmercury be again admitted it will rise nearly to the very top of the\r\ntube, driving the bubble up. Thus we find we have formed water from the\r\ntwo gases.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of water is easily affected by electricity, and if\r\na little sulphuric acid be added to the water, the experiment will\r\nbe thereby facilitated. Two wires from a battery should be inserted\r\nthrough a glass filled with the water, and into two test tubes also\r\nfilled. The wires terminate in platinum strips, and are fastened at the\r\nother end to the positive and negative poles of the galvanic battery.\r\nThe gases will collect in the test tubes, and will be found in proper\r\nproportions when the current passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344.—The Eudiometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345.—Decomposition of water.]\r\n\r\nSo much for water in its liquid state. The solid condition of water\r\n(ice) is equally interesting. When we apply heat to water, we get a\r\nvapour called “steam”; when we cool water to 32° Fahr., we get a solid\r\nmass which weighs just the same as the liquid we have congealed, or the\r\nsteam we have raised from an equal amount of water. But water expands\r\nwhile in the process of solidification, just as it does when it becomes\r\ngaseous, and as we have remarked before, our water-pipes bear full\r\ntestimony to this scientific fact. When ice forms it has a tendency\r\nto crystallize, and some of these ice crystals are, as we see, very\r\nbeautiful. Snow is only water in a nearly solid form, and the crystals\r\nare extremely elegant, appearing more like flowers than congealed\r\nwater, in tiny six-pointed ice crystals. Many philosophers of late\r\nyears have written concerning these tiny crystals, which, in common\r\nwith all crystals, have their own certain form, from which they never\r\ndepart. Snowflakes are regular six-sided prisms grouped around a centre\r\nforming angles of 60° and 120°. There are a number of forms, as will\r\nbe seen from the accompanying illustrations, and at least ninety-six\r\nvarieties have been observed. One snowflake, apparently so like all\r\nother flakes that fall, can thus be viewed with much interest, and yet,\r\nwhile so very various, snowflakes never get away from their proper\r\nhexagonal structure. It has been remarked that snowflakes falling at\r\nthe same time have generally the same form.\r\n\r\nOf the latent heat of ice, etc., we have already spoken in our article\r\nupon Heat, and therefore it will be sufficient to state that the latent\r\nheat of water is 79 thermal units, because when passing from the liquid\r\nto the solid state a certain amount of water absorbs sufficient heat to\r\nraise an equal quantity of the liquid 79°. This can be proved by taking\r\na measured quantity (say a pint) of water at 79° and adding ice of the\r\nsame weight to the water. The mixture will be found to be at zero.\r\nTherefore the ice has absorbed or rendered latent 79° of heat which the\r\nwater possessed. If we melt ice until only a trace of it is left, we\r\nshall still find the water as cold as the ice was; all the latent heat\r\nis employed in melting the ice. So it will take as much heat to bring a\r\npound of ice at zero to a pound of water at zero, as it would to raise\r\n79 pounds of water 1°. The same law applies to steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346.—Snow crystals.]\r\n\r\nWater can be distilled in small quantities by an apparatus, as figured\r\nin the illustration, and by these means we get rid of all impurities\r\nwhich are inseparable from the liquid otherwise. When it is desirable\r\nto distil large quantities of water a larger apparatus is used, called\r\nan “Alembic.” The principle is simply to convert the liquid by heat\r\ninto vapour, then cool it, by condensation, in another vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347.—Distilling water.]\r\n\r\nThe evaporation of water, with its effects upon our globe, belong more\r\nto the study of Meteorology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348.—Distillation.]\r\n\r\nRain-water is the purest, as we have said, because it goes through the\r\nprocess of distillation by nature. The sun takes it up, by evaporation,\r\ninto the air, where it is condensed, and falls as rain-water. Water\r\ncontaining carbonate of lime will petrify or harden, as in stalactite\r\ncaverns. The carbonic acid escapes from the dripping water, the\r\ncarbonate in solution is deposited as a stalactite, and finally forms\r\npillars in the cave. Sea-water contains many salts; its composition is\r\nas follows, according to Dr. Schwertzer, of Brighton:—\r\n\r\n  Water                                      964·74372 grains.\r\n  Chloride of sodium (salt)                   28·05948    ”\r\n  Chloride of potassium                        0·76552    ”\r\n  Chloride of magnesium                        3·66658    ”\r\n  Bromide of magnesium                         0·02929    ”\r\n  Sulphate of magnesia                         2·29578    ”\r\n  Sulphate of lime                             0·40662    ”\r\n  Carbonate of lime                            0·03301    ”\r\n    (With traces of iodine and ammonia).    --—--—----\r\n                                            1000·00000 grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.—Stalactite Cavern.]\r\n\r\nThere is much more oxygen in water than in air, as can be ascertained\r\nby analysis of these compounds. This great proportion in favour of\r\nwater enables fish to breathe by passing the water through the gills.\r\nMarine animals (not fishes), like the whale,—which is a warm-blooded\r\ncreature, and therefore not suited to exist without air,—are obliged\r\nto come to the surface to breathe. The density of salt water is much\r\ngreater than that of fresh water, and therefore swimming and flotation\r\nis easier in the sea than in a river. We shall have more to say of\r\nwater by-and-by.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN—SYMBOL =N=; ATOMIC WEIGHT 14.\r\n\r\nWe have already made some reference to this gas when speaking of the\r\natmosphere and its constituents, of which nitrogen is the principal.\r\nFrom its life-destroying properties it is called “azote” by French\r\nchemists, and when we wish to obtain a supply of nitrogen all we have\r\nto do is to take away the oxygen from the air by burning phosphorus\r\non water under a glass. Nitrogen is not found frequently in solid\r\nportions of the globe. It is abundant in animals. It is without colour\r\nor smell, and can be breathed in air without danger. It is heavy and\r\nsluggish; but if we put a taper into a jar of nitrogen it will go out,\r\nand animals die in the gas for want of oxygen, as nitrogen alone cannot\r\nsupport life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350.—Obtaining nitrogen.]\r\n\r\nThe affinity of nitrogen for other substances is not great, but it\r\ngives rise to five compounds, which are as below, in the order they are\r\ncombined with oxygen:—\r\n\r\n  Nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”)  (Monoxide)   N_{2}O.\r\n  Nitric oxide                    Dioxide      N_{2}O_{2}.\r\n  Nitrous acid                    Trioxide     N_{2}O_{3}.\r\n  Nitric peroxide                 Tetroxide    N_{2}O_{4}.\r\n  Nitric acid                     Pentoxide    N_{2}O_{5}.\r\n\r\nThese compounds are usually taken as representative examples of\r\ncombining weight, and as explanatory of the symbolic nomenclature of\r\nchemistry, as they advance in such regular proportions of oxygen with\r\nnitrogen. The combining weight of nitrogen is 14, and when two parts\r\ncombine with five of oxygen it makes nitric acid, and we put it down\r\nas N_{2}O_{5}; on adding water, HNO_{3}, as we can see by eliminating\r\nthe constituents and putting in the proportions. Actually it is\r\nH_{2}N_{2}O_{6}, or, by division, HNO_{3}.\r\n\r\nNitrogen plays a very important part in nature, particularly in the\r\nvegetable kingdom. Nitric acid has been known for centuries. Geber,\r\nthe alchemist, was acquainted with a substance called “nitric,”\r\nwhich he found would yield a dissolvent under certain circumstances.\r\nHe called it “dissolving fluid.” At the end of the twelfth century\r\nAlbert Magnus investigated the properties of this acid, and in 1235\r\nRaymond Lully prepared nitre with clay, and gave the liquid the\r\nname of “aqua-fortis.” But till 1849 nitric acid was only known as\r\na hydrate,—that is, in combination with water,—but now we have the\r\nanhydrous acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.—Apparatus for obtaining nitrogen by using\r\nmetal to absorb the oxygen of the air.]\r\n\r\nOxygen and nitrogen combine under the influence of electricity, as\r\nshown by Cavendish, who passed a current through an atmospheric\r\nmixture of oxygen and nitrogen, in a tube terminating in a solution of\r\npotash, lime, and soda. Every time the spark passed, the volume of gas\r\ndiminished, and nitric acid was formed, as it is in thunderstorms, when\r\nit does not remain free, but unites with ammonia, and forms a highly\r\nuseful salt, which promotes vegetable growth. Here is another instance\r\nof the usefulness of thunderstorms, and of the grand provisions of\r\nnature for our benefit. Nitric acid is obtained by distilling nitre\r\nwith sulphuric acid. The liquid is, when pure, colourless, and is a\r\npowerful oxidizer. It dissolves most metals, and destroys vegetable and\r\nanimal substances. By an addition of a little sulphuric acid the water\r\nis taken from the nitric acid, and a very powerful form of it is the\r\nresult. The acid is of great use in medicine, and as an application\r\nto bites of rabid animals or serpents. It converts cotton waste into\r\n“gun-cotton” by a very simple process of steeping, washing, and\r\npressing. From the hydraulic press it comes in discs like “quoits,”\r\nwhich will burn harmlessly and smoulder away, but if detonated\r\nthey explode with great violence. As a rule, when damp, it is not\r\ndangerous, but it can be fired even when wet. It will explode at a less\r\ntemperature than gunpowder, and, moreover, yields no smoke, nor does\r\nit foul a gun. Gun-cotton, when dissolved in ether, gives us collodion\r\nfor photographic purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.—Nitric acid obtained from nitre and sulphuric\r\nacid.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking farther of the compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, we will\r\nlimit ourselves to the monoxide, or laughing gas. This is now used\r\nas an anæsthetic in dentistry, etc., and is quite successful, as a\r\nrule. People afflicted with heart disease should not use it without\r\nadvice, however. When inhaled into the lungs it makes the subject very\r\nhilarious, and the effect is rather noisy. It is obtained from the\r\nnitrate of ammonia, which, on the application of heat, decomposes into\r\nnitrous oxide and vapour. Warm water should be used for the trough. The\r\ngas is a powerful supporter of combustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.—Cavendish’s experiment.]\r\n\r\nBinoxide of nitrogen is of importance in the manufacture of sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nNitrogen combines with hydrogen, forming various compounds. These\r\nare the “amines,” also ammonia, and ammonium. Ammonia possesses the\r\nproperties of a base. Its name is derived from Jupiter Ammon, near\r\nwhose temple it was prepared, from camels’ dung. But bodies containing\r\nnitrogen give off ammonia in course of distilling, and hartshorn is\r\nthe term applied to horn-cuttings, which yield ammonia, which is a\r\ncolourless gas of strong odour and taste now obtained from gas-works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354.—Experiment to obtain nitric acid.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.—Apparatus for obtaining laughing-gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.—Inhaling laughing gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.—Generation of ammonia.]\r\n\r\nTo obtain ammonia heat equal parts of chloride of ammonia (sal\r\nammoniac) and quick-lime powdered (_see_ fig. 357). The gas must be\r\ncollected over mercury, because it is very soluble in water. Ammonia\r\nis useful to restore tipsy people and fainting ladies. A solution of\r\nammonia is used for cauteries. Ammoniacal gas is remarkable for its\r\nsolubility in water. To prepare the solution the gas is forced through\r\na series of flasks. The tubes carrying the gas should be continued to\r\nthe bottoms of the flasks, else the solution, being lighter than water,\r\nthe upper portion alone would be saturated. The tubes carrying away\r\nthe solution are raised a little, so that the renewal is continually\r\nproceeding. The gas liquifies under a pressure of six atmospheres,\r\nat a temperature of 10° Cent. This experiment can be artificially\r\nperformed by heating chloride of silver saturated with ammonia, and\r\nthe silver will part with the gas at a temperature of 40° C. The gas\r\nwill then condense in a liquid form in the tube. The experiment may\r\nbe facilitated by placing the other extremity of the tube in snow and\r\nsalt, and by the liquid we can obtain intense cold. This experiment\r\nhas been made use of by M. Carré in his refrigerator (which was\r\ndescribed in the Physics’ section), by which he freezes water. We may,\r\nhowever, just refer to the process. Whenever the condition of a body\r\nis changed from that of liquid to a gas, the temperature is greatly\r\nlowered, because the heat becomes “latent.” The latest freezing machine\r\nconsists of an apparatus as shown in the illustrations herewith (figs.\r\n359 and 360). The machine is of wrought iron, and contains, when\r\nready for action, a saturated solution of ammonia at zero. This is\r\nin communication with another and an air-tight vessel, of which the\r\ncentre is hollow. The first process is to heat the solution, and the\r\ngas escapes into the second “vase,” which is surrounded by cold water,\r\nand quite unable to escape. A tremendous pressure is soon obtained, and\r\nthis, added to the cold water, before long liquifies the ammonia, and\r\nwhen the temperature indicates 130° the hot vessel is suddenly cooled\r\nby being put into the water. The gas is thus suddenly converted into\r\na liquid, the water in the second hollow vase is taken out, and the\r\nbottle to be frozen is put into the cavity. The cold is so great, in\r\nconsequence of the transformation of the liquid ammonia into a gas,\r\nthat it freezes the water in any vessel put into the receiver. The\r\nammonia can be reconverted into liquid and back again, so no loss is\r\noccasioned by the process, which is rapid and simple. This is how great\r\nblocks of ice are produced in water-bottles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.—Liquefaction of ammonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.—Carré’s refrigerator (first action).]\r\n\r\nThe one important point upon which care is necessary is the raising of\r\nthe temperature. If it be elevated beyond 130° C., the pressure will be\r\ntoo great, and an explosion will occur.\r\n\r\nThe abundant formation of ammonia from decaying animal matter is\r\nevident to everyone, and depends upon the presence of moisture to a\r\ngreat extent. Chloride of ammonia is called sal-ammoniac, and the\r\ncarbonate of ammonia crystallizes from the alkaline liquid produced by\r\nthe distillation of certain animal matter. The compounds of ammonia are\r\neasily recognized by a certain sharp taste. They are highly valuable\r\nremedial agents, acting particularly upon the cutaneous system, and\r\nwhen taken internally, produce the effect of powerful sudorifics.\r\nTheir _volatility_, and the facility with which they are expelled from\r\nother substances, render them of great importance in chemistry, and\r\npeculiarly fit them for the purposes of many chemical analyses. The\r\nammonia compounds display a remarkable analogy to the corresponding\r\ncombinations of potash and soda. The compounds of ammonia are highly\r\nimportant in their relation to the vegetable kingdom. It may be assumed\r\nthat all the _nitrogen_ of plants is derived from the ammonia which\r\nthey absorb from the soil, and from the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.—Carré’s refrigerator (second action).]\r\n\r\nThe similarity of ammonia to the metallic oxides has led to the\r\nconjecture that all its combinations contain a _compound_ metallic\r\nbody, which has received the name _ammonium_ (NH_{4}); but no one has\r\nyet succeeded in its preparation, although by peculiar processes it may\r\nbe obtained in the form of an amalgam.\r\n\r\nAmmonias, in which one or more atoms of hydrogen are replaced by basic\r\nradicals, are termed _Amides_, or _Amines_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nNON-METALLIC ELEMENTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n CHLORINE—BROMINE—IODINE—FLUORINE—CARBON—SULPHUR—PHOSPHORUS—SILICON—\r\n BORON—TELLURIUM—ARSENIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nChlorine (Cl.) is usually found with sodium in the mineral kingdom, and\r\nthis chloride of sodium is our common salt. Chlorine can be obtained by\r\nheating hydrochloric acid with binoxide of manganese. (Atomic weight\r\n35·5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.—Generation of chlorine.]\r\n\r\nChlorine possesses a greenish-yellow colour, hence its name “Chloros,”\r\ngreen. It should be handled carefully, for it is highly injurious and\r\nsuffocating. It possesses a great affinity for other substances, and\r\nattacks the metals. For hydrogen it has a great affection, and when\r\nhydrogen is combined with any other substances chlorine immediately\r\nattacks them, and in time destroys them. But even this destructive\r\nand apparently objectionable quality makes chlorine very valuable;\r\nfor if we carry the idea to its conclusion, we shall find that it\r\nalso destroys offensive and putrid matter, and purifies the atmosphere\r\nvery much. Most colouring matters include hydrogen, and therefore they\r\nare destroyed by chlorine, which is a great “bleacher” as well as a\r\npurifier. If we dip any vegetable dyes into a jar of chlorine, they\r\nwill become white if the dyed substances are damp.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid is known as muriatic acid and spirits of salt. It is\r\nobtained when salt is treated with sulphuric acid and the gas comes\r\noff into water. Equal parts of the acid and the salt are put into a\r\nflask as in the cut (fig. 362), and diluted with water. The mixture is\r\nthen heated. The gas is condensed in the bottles half-full of water.\r\nThe result gives sulphate of soda and hydrochloric acid. This acid is\r\nprocured in soda manufactories, and with nitric acid is called “aqua\r\nregia,” a solvent for gold. When chlorine and hydrogen are mixed\r\nin equal proportions they explode in sunlight. In the dark or by\r\ncandle-light they are harmless. Dry chlorine gas can be obtained by\r\ninterposing a glass filled with some chloride of calcium. The gas being\r\nheavier than air (about 2½ times), displaces it in the flask, and\r\nwhen it is filled another can be placed in position. This mode causes a\r\nlittle waste of gas, which should not be breathed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.—Production of hydrochloric acid.]\r\n\r\nChlorine possesses a great affinity for certain bodies. If the gas be\r\nthrown upon phosphorus, the latter will burn brilliantly. Arsenic,\r\ntin, and antimony when powdered and poured from a shoot into a vase of\r\nchlorine will burst into brilliant sparks, and other metals will glow\r\nwhen introduced to this gas. Chlorine forms many unstable combinations\r\nwith oxygen. Its combination with hydrogen has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nBROMINE is a rare element. (Symbol Br. Atomic weight 80.)\r\n\r\nIt is deep brownish red, very volatile, and of a peculiar odour.\r\nBromine unites with the elementary bodies, and forms some oxygen\r\ncompounds. It resembles chlorine in its properties, and is used in\r\nmedicine and in photography. It is found in saline springs and in salt\r\nwater, combined with soda and magnesium. The presence of bromine may\r\neasily be detected in the strong smell of seaweed. Its combinations\r\nwith metals are termed bromides. It is a powerful poison.\r\n\r\nIODINE is another relative of chlorine. It is found in\r\nseaweed, which by burning is reduced to _kelp_. When iodine is heated\r\na beautiful violet vapour comes off, and this characteristic has given\r\nit its name (“iodes,” violet). Iodine was discovered by Courtois, of\r\nParis, and in 1813, Gay Lussac made it a special study. It is solid\r\nat ordinary temperatures, and assumes crystallized forms in plates\r\nof metallic lustre. It is an excellent remedy in “goitre” and such\r\naffections. (Symbol I. Atomic weight 127.)\r\n\r\nFLUORINE is very difficult to prepare. Fluor spar is a compound of\r\nfluorine and calcium. This element is gaseous, and combines so rapidly\r\nthat it is very difficult to obtain in a free state. Etching on glass\r\nis accomplished by means of hydrofluoric acid, for fluorine has a\r\ngreat affinity for silicic acid, which is contained in glass. The\r\nglass is covered with wax, and the design is traced with a needle. The\r\nacid attacks the glass and leaves the wax, so the design is eaten in.\r\n(Symbol F. Atomic weight 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.—Apparatus for obtaining dry chlorine gas.]\r\n\r\nChlorine, fluorine, bromine, and iodine are termed “Halogens”\r\n(producers of salts). They appear, as we have seen, in a gaseous,\r\nliquid, and solid form respectively.\r\n\r\nCARBON is the most, or one of the most, largely diffused elements in\r\nnature, and claims more than a passing notice at our hands, though\r\neven that must be brief. We may put down carbon next to oxygen as the\r\nmost important element in the world. The forms assumed by carbon are\r\nvery variable, and pervade nature in all its phases. We have carbon in\r\ncrystals, in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and amongst the chief\r\nminerals a solid, odourless, tasteless, infusible, and almost insoluble\r\nbody. In various combinations carbon meets us at every turn; united\r\nwith oxygen it forms carbonic acid, which we exhale for the plants\r\nto imbibe. We have it in coal, with hydrogen and oxygen. We have it\r\nbuilding up animal tissues, and it is never absent in two out of the\r\nthree great divisions of nature—the plants and the animals (Symbol C;\r\nAtomic W. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364.—Facets of a brilliant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.—Facets of a rose diamond.]\r\n\r\nWe have carbon in three different and well-known conditions; as\r\nthe diamond, as graphite, or black-lead, and as charcoal. The\r\nproperties of the diamond are well known, and we shall, when we get\r\nto Crystallography, learn the forms of diamond or crystals of carbon.\r\nAt present we give an illustration or two, reserving all explanation\r\nfor the present. Diamond cutting is a matter of some difficulty, and\r\nit requires skill to cut in the proper direction. Diamonds are found\r\nin India, Brazil, and at the Cape of Good Hope, in alluvial soil.\r\nThe identity of diamond and charcoal was discovered accidentally.\r\nAn experiment to fuse a few small diamonds resulted in their\r\ndisappearance, and when the residue was examined it was found that the\r\ndiamonds had been burned, that they had combined with oxygen and formed\r\ncarbonic acid, just as when coal burns. The diamond is the hardest of\r\nall substances, the most valuable of gems, and the purest condition in\r\nwhich carbon appears.\r\n\r\nGRAPHITE (Plumbago) is termed “black-lead,” and is the next purest form\r\nof carbon. It crystallizes and belongs to the primitive formations. In\r\nCumberland it is dug up and used to make pencils; the operations can be\r\nseen at Keswick. It has other uses of a domestic character.\r\n\r\nCharcoal is the third form of carbon, and as it possesses no definite\r\nform, is said to be _amorphous_. Charcoal is prepared in air-tight\r\novens, so that no oxygen can enter and burn the wood thus treated.\r\nCoke is the result of the same process applied to coal. The gas\r\nmanufactories are the chief depôts for this article, and it is used in\r\nlocomotive engines. The various smokeless coals and prepared fuels,\r\nhowever, are frequently substituted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366. —Coke ovens.]\r\n\r\nCoke ovens were formerly much resorted to by the railway companies, who\r\nfound the ordinary coal too smoky for locomotive purposes, and apt to\r\ngive rise to complaints by passengers and residents near the line.\r\n\r\nThe origin of wood charcoal we have seen. All vegetable substances\r\ncontain carbon. When we burn wood, in the absence of air as far as\r\npossible, oxygen and hydrogen are expelled. The wood is piled in layers\r\nas in the illustration (fig. 368), covered over with turf and mould,\r\nwith occasional apertures for air. This mass is ignited, the oxygen\r\nand hydrogen are driven off, and carbon remains. (Animal charcoal\r\nis obtained from calcining bones). Wood charcoal attracts vapours,\r\nand water, if impure, can be purified by charcoal, and any impure or\r\ntainted animal matter can be rendered inoffensive by reason of charcoal\r\nabsorbing the gases, while the process of decay goes on just the same.\r\nHousekeepers should therefore not always decide that meat is good\r\nbecause it is not offensive to the olfactory nerves. Charcoal will\r\nremove the aroma, but the meat may be nevertheless bad. The use of\r\ncharcoal in filters is acknowledged universally, and as a constituent\r\nof gunpowder it is important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.—Charcoal burning.]\r\n\r\nCarbon is not easily affected by the atmospheric air, or in the\r\nearth; so in many instances wood is charred before being driven into\r\nthe ground; and casks for water are prepared so. Soot is carbon in\r\na pulverised condition, and Indian ink is manufactured with its\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.—Wood piles of charcoal burners.]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of wood charcoal gives occupation to men who are\r\nfrequently wild and untutored, but the results of their labour are very\r\nbeneficial. Care should be taken not to sleep in a room with a charcoal\r\nstove burning, unless there is ample vent for the carbonic acid gas,\r\nfor it will cause suffocation. Lampblack is obtained by holding a plate\r\nover the flame of some resinous substance, which deposits the black\r\nupon it. There is a special apparatus for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.—Seltzer-water manufactory.]\r\n\r\nCarbon combines with oxygen to make carbonic acid gas, as we have\r\nalready mentioned, and in other proportions to form a more deadly\r\ncompound than the other. The former is the dioxide (CO_{2}), the\r\nlatter the monoxide, or carbonic oxide (CO). The dioxide is the\r\nmore important, being held in the atmosphere, and combined with lime\r\nin chalk. All sparkling beverages contain carbonic acid, to which\r\ntheir effervescence is due. The soda and other mineral waters owe\r\ntheir sparkle to this gas. Soda-water consists of a weak solution of\r\ncarbonate of soda and the acid. There is a vessel holding chalk and\r\nwater, and another containing some sulphuric acid. When the sulphuric\r\nacid is permitted to unite with the chalk and water, carbonic acid\r\nis liberated. A boy turning a wheel forces the gas into the water in\r\nthe bottles, or the water and carbonate of soda is drawn off thus\r\nimpregnated into bottles and corked down, in the manner so familiar to\r\nall. The bottles are made of the shape depicted, so that the bubble\r\nof air shall be at the top when the bottle lies down. If it be not\r\nkept so, the air will eventually escape, no matter how tightly the\r\ncork be put in. The ordinary “soda-water” contains scarcely any soda.\r\nIt is merely water, chalk, and carbonic acid. The “Gazogene” is made\r\nuseful for small quantities of soda-water, and is arranged in the\r\nfollowing manner. The appearance of it is familiar to all. It consists\r\nof a double vessel, into the upper part of which a solution of any\r\nkind—wine and water, or even plain water—is put, to be saturated with\r\ncarbonic acid, or “aerated,” and into the lower one some carbonate of\r\nsoda and tartaric acid. A tube leads from this lower to the top of the\r\nupper vessel, which screws on and off. By shaking the apparatus when\r\nthus charged and screwed together, some of the liquid descends through\r\nthe tube into the lower vessel and moistens the soda and acid, which\r\ntherefore act on each other, and cause carbonic acid to be disengaged;\r\nthis, rising up through the tube (which is perforated with small holes\r\nat the upper part), disperses itself through the liquid in small\r\nbubbles, and causes sufficient pressure to enable the liquid to absorb\r\nit, which therefore effervesces when drawn off by the tap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.—Gazogene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.—Soda-water apparatus.]\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid can be liquified, and then it is colourless. In a solid\r\nform it resembles snow, and if pressed with the fingers it will blister\r\nthem. Being very heavy the gas can be poured into a vase, and if there\r\nbe a light in the receptacle the flame will be immediately extinguished.\r\n\r\nThat even the gas introduced into seltzer-water is capable of\r\ndestroying life, the following experiment will prove. Let us place\r\na bird within a glass case as in the illustration (fig. 373), and\r\nconnect the glass with a bottle of seltzer-water or a siphon. As soon\r\nas the liquid enters, the carbonic acid will ascend, and this, if\r\ncontinued for a long time, would suffocate the bird, which soon begins\r\nto develop an appearance of restlessness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372.—Pouring out the carbonic acid gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.—Experiment with carbonic acid.]\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked upon the important part taken by this gas\r\nin nature, so we need only mention its existence in pits and caves.\r\nThere are many places in which the vapour is so strong as to render\r\nthe localities uninhabitable. In the Middle Ages the vapours were\r\nattributed to the presence of evil spirits, who were supposed to\r\nextinguish miners’ lamps, and suffocate people who ventured into the\r\ncaves. In the Grotto Del Cane there is still an example, and certain\r\ncaves of Montrouge are often filled with the gas. A lighted taper\r\nheld in the hand will, by its extinction, give the necessary warning.\r\nOxygen and carbon are condensed in carbonic acid, for the gas contains\r\na volume of oxygen equal to its own. If we fill a glass globe, as per\r\nillustration (fig. 374), with pure oxygen, and in the globe insert two\r\ncarbon points, through which we pass a current of electricity, we shall\r\nfind, after the experiment, that if the stop-cock be opened, there is\r\nno escape of gas, and yet the mercury does not rise in the tube, so the\r\noxygen absorbed has been replaced by an equal volume of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe other combination of carbon with oxygen is the carbonic oxide (CO),\r\nand when a small quantity of oxygen is burnt with it it gives a blue\r\nflame, as on the top of the fire in our ordinary grates. This gas is\r\npresent in lime kilns, and is a very deadly one. We must now pass\r\nrapidly through the compounds of carbon with hydrogen, merely referring\r\nto coal for a moment as we go on.\r\n\r\nCoal, of which we shall learn more in Mineralogy and Geology, is\r\na combination, mechanical or otherwise, and is the result of the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable matter in remote ages,—the so-called\r\n“forests,” which were more like the jungles than the woods of the\r\npresent day. Moss and fern played prominent parts in this great\r\ntransformation, as we can see in the Irish peat-bogs, where the first\r\nsteps to the coal measures are taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.—Experiment showing that carbonic acid contains\r\noxygen and carbon.]\r\n\r\nThe compounds of carbon with hydrogen are important. There is the\r\n“light” carburetted hydrogen (CH_{4}), which is usually known as\r\nfire-damp in coal mines. It is highly inflammable and dangerous. The\r\nsafety-lamp invented by Davy is a great protection against it, for as\r\nthe gas enters it is cooled by the wire, and burns within harmlessly.\r\nThe explosion warns the miner. “Heavy” carburetted hydrogen possesses\r\ndouble the quantity of carbon (C_{2}H_{4}). It is also explosive when\r\nmixed with oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.—Temperature reduced by contact with wire.]\r\n\r\nThe most useful compound is coal-gas, and though its principal function\r\nappears to be in some manner superseded by electricity, “gas” is still\r\ntoo important to be put aside. It can easily be obtained by putting\r\nsmall fragments of coal in the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, closing the\r\nbowl with clay, and putting it in the fire. Before long the gas will\r\nissue from the stem of the pipe, and may either be lighted or collected\r\nin a bladder. For the use of the “million,” however, gas is prepared\r\nupon a very large scale, and is divided into three processes—its\r\n“formation,” “purification,” and its “collection” for distribution to\r\nconsumers. The first process is carried on by means of retorts shown\r\nin the illustration (fig. 376). The first portion of the next figure\r\nis a section of a furnace, the other part shows two furnaces from the\r\nfront. The following is the mode employed. The coal is put into retorts\r\nfitted to the furnace, so that they are surrounded by the flames, and\r\nterminating in a horizontal tube called the hydraulic main, E, which is\r\nin its turn connected with a pit or opening for the reception of the\r\ntar and ammoniacal liquor, etc., which condenses from the gas. It then\r\npasses up and down a series of tubes in water, called a “condenser,”\r\nand in this are reservoirs or receptacles for any tar and ammonia\r\nthat remain. But sulphur is still present, so the gas is carried to\r\nthe purifying apparatus (D in fig. 378), which consists of a large\r\ncylindrical vessel air-tight, with an inverted funnel, nearly filled\r\nwith a mixture of lime and water. The gas bubbles in, and the sulphur\r\nunites with the lime, while the gas rises to the top (trays of lime\r\nare used when the gas enters from the bottom). The Gasometer, a large\r\nvessel closed at the top and open below, dips into a large trough of\r\ncircular shape. The gasometer is balanced by weights and chains, and\r\nmay be raised (_See_ fig. 379). When quite empty the top rests upon\r\nthe ground, and when the gas enters it is raised to the top of the\r\nframe which supports it. We have now our Gasometer full. When the time\r\ncomes to fill the pipes for lighting purposes, some of the weights are\r\nremoved, the Gasometer falls down slowly, and forces the gas through\r\nthe tubes into the main supply to be distributed. About four cubic feet\r\nof gas is obtained from every pound of coal. When gas and air become\r\nmixed, the mixture is very explosive. In a house where an escape of\r\ngas is detected let the windows be opened at the top, and no light\r\nintroduced for several minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376.—Retorts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Fig. 377.—Section.      Front view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Fig. 378.—Condenser.      Purifier.      Gasometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.—Gasometer.]\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that one ton of good coal produces the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n      1 Chaldron of coke              weighing  1,494 lbs.\r\n     12 Gallons of tar                   ”        135 lbs.\r\n     12 Gallons of ammoniacal liquor     ”        100 lbs.\r\n  5,900 Cubic feet of gas                ”        291 lbs.\r\n        Loss (water)                     ”        220 lbs.\r\n                                                ----------\r\n                                          Total 2,240 lbs.\r\n                                                ==========\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.—Gasometer]\r\n\r\nWe can thus estimate the profits of our gas companies at leisure. The\r\nanalysis of gas made by Professor Bunsen is as under, in 100 parts.\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen                  45·58\r\n  Marsh gas                 34·90\r\n  Carbonic oxide             6·64\r\n  Olefiant gas               4·08\r\n  Butyline                   2·38\r\n  Sulphide of hydrogen       0·29\r\n  Nitrogen                   2·46\r\n  Carbonic acid              3·67\r\n                           ------\r\n                           100·00\r\n                           ======\r\n\r\nGas, therefore, is very injurious, for it rapidly vitiates the\r\natmosphere it burns in, and is very trying to the eyes, as well as\r\ndestructive to gilt ornaments.\r\n\r\nTar is familiar to all readers, and though unpleasant to handle or\r\nto smell, it produces the beautiful aniline dyes. Tar pills are very\r\nefficacious for some blood disorders, and will remove pimples, etc.,\r\nfrom the face, and cure “boils” effectually. If a dose of five be\r\ntaken first, in a day or two four, and so on, no second remedy need be\r\napplied. We have known cases finally cured, and no recurrence of boils\r\never ensued after this simple remedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381.—Tar manufactory]\r\n\r\nTar is one of the results left in the distillation both of wood and\r\ncoal: in places where wood is plentiful and tar in request, it is\r\nproduced by burning the wood for that purpose; and in some of the pits\r\nin which charcoal is produced, an arrangement is made to collect the\r\ntar also. Coal-tar and wood-tar are different in some respects, and\r\nare both distilled to procure the napthas which bear their respective\r\nnames. From wood-tar creosote is also extracted, and it is this\r\nsubstance which gives the peculiar tarry flavours to provisions, such\r\nas ham, bacon, or herrings, cured or preserved by being smoked over\r\nwood fires. Tar is used as a sort of paint for covering wood-work and\r\ncordage when much exposed to wet, which it resists better than anything\r\nelse at the same price; but the tar chiefly used for these purposes is\r\nthat produced by burning fir or deal wood and condensing the tar in a\r\npit below the stack of wood; it is called Stockholm tar, as it comes\r\nchiefly from that place.\r\n\r\nCarbon only combines with nitrogen under peculiar circumstances. This\r\nindirect combination is termed _cyanogen_ (CN). It was discovered\r\nby Gay-Lussac, and is used for the production of Prussian blue.\r\nHydrocyanide of potassium (Prussic acid) is prepared by heating cyanide\r\nof potassium with sulphuric acid. It is a deadly poison, and found\r\nin peach-stones. Free cyanogen is a gas. The bisulphide of carbon is\r\na colourless, transparent liquid. It will easily dissolve sulphur and\r\nphosphorus and several resins. When phosphorus is dissolved in it, it\r\nmakes a very dangerous “fire,” and one difficult to extinguish. We must\r\nnow leave carbon and its combinations, and come to sulphur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382.—Sulphur furnace.]\r\n\r\nSULPHUR is found in a native state in Sicily and many other localities\r\nwhich are volcanic. It is a yellow, solid body, and as it is never\r\nperfectly free from earthy matter, it must be purified before it can\r\nbe used. It possesses neither taste nor smell, and is insoluble in\r\nwater. Sulphur is purified in a retort, C D, which communicates with\r\na brick chamber, A. The retort is placed over a furnace, K, and the\r\nvapour passes into the chimney through the tube, D, where it condenses\r\ninto fine powder called “flowers of sulphur” (brimstone). A valve\r\npermits the heated air to pass off, while no exterior air can pass in,\r\nfor explosions would take place were the heated vapour to meet the\r\natmospheric air. The danger is avoided by putting an air reservoir\r\noutside the chimney which is heated by the furnace. The sulphur is\r\ndrawn out through the aperture, _r_, when deposited on the floor of\r\nthe chamber. The sulphur is cast into cylinders and sold. Sulphur is\r\nsoluble in bisulphide of carbon, and is used as a medical agent.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of sulphurs with oxygen form an interesting series. There\r\nare two anhydrous oxides (anhydrides),—viz., sulphurous and sulphuric\r\nanhydride (SO_{2} and SO_{3}). There are two notable acids formed\r\nby the combination with water, sulphurous and sulphuric, and some\r\nothers, which, as in the case of nitrogen, form a series of multiple\r\nproportions, the oxygen being present in an increasing regularity of\r\nprogression, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Name of Acid.                             Chemical Formula.\r\n\r\n  Hypo-sulphurous acid                      H_{2}SO_{2}\r\n  Sulphurous acid                           H_{2}SO_{3}\r\n  Sulphuric acid                            H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n  Thio-sulphuric, or hypo-sulphuric acid    H_{2}S_{2}O_{3}\r\n  Dithionic acid                            H_{2}S_{2}O_{6}\r\n  Trithionic acid                           H_{2}S_{3}O_{6}\r\n  Tetrathionic acid                         H_{2}S_{4}O_{6}\r\n  Pentathionic acid                         H_{2}S_{5}O_{6}\r\n\r\nThe last four are termed “polythionic,” because the proportions of\r\nsulphur vary with constant proportions of the other constituents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383.—Liquefaction of sulphuric acid.]\r\n\r\nThe sulphurous anhydride mentioned above is produced when we burn\r\nsulphur in the air, or in oxygen; it may be obtained in other ways.\r\nIt is a colourless gas, and when subjected to pressure may be\r\nliquified, and crystallized at very low temperature. It was formerly\r\ncalled sulphuric acid. It is a powerful “reducing agent,” and a good\r\nantiseptic. It dissolves in water, and forms the H_{2}SO_{3}, now known\r\nas sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384.—Retorts and receivers for acid.]\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is a most dangerous agent in wicked or inexperienced\r\nhands, and amateurs should be very careful when dealing with it. It\r\ntakes the water from the moist air, and from vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances. It carbonizes and destroys all animal tissues. Its\r\ndiscovery is due to Basil Valentine, in 1440. He distilled sulphate\r\nof iron, or green vitriol, and the result was “oil of vitriol.” It\r\nis still manufactured in this way in the Hartz district, and the\r\nacid passes by retorts into receivers. The earthen retorts, A, are\r\narranged in the furnace as in the illustration, and the receivers,\r\nB, containing a little sulphuric acid, are firmly fixed to them. The\r\noily brown product fumes in the air, and is called “fuming sulphuric\r\nacid,” or Nordhausen acid. Sulphuric acid is very much used in chemical\r\nmanufactures, and the prices of many necessaries, such as soap, soda,\r\ncalico, stearin, paper, etc., are in close relationship with the cost\r\nand production of sulphur, which also plays an important part in the\r\nmaking of gunpowder. The manufacture of the acid is carried on in\r\nplatinum stills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385.—Experiment to show the existence of gases in\r\nsolution.]\r\n\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen, or the hydric sulphide (H_{2}S), is a colourless\r\nand horribly-smelling gas, and arises from putrefying vegetable and\r\nanimal matter which contains sulphur. The odour of rotten eggs is due\r\nto this gas, which is very dangerous when breathed in a pure state in\r\ndrains, etc. It can be made by treating a sulphide with sulphuric acid.\r\nIt is capable of precipitating the metals when in solution, and so\r\nby its aid we can discover the metallic ingredient if it be present.\r\nThe gas is soluble in water, and makes its presence known in certain\r\nsulphur springs. The colour imparted to egg-spoons and fish-knives\r\nand forks sometimes is due to the presence of metallic sulphides. The\r\nsolution is called hydro-sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS occurs in very small quantities, though in the form of\r\nphosphates we are acquainted with it pretty generally, and as such it\r\nis absorbed by plants, and is useful in agricultural operations. In\r\nour organization—in the brain, the nerves, flesh, and particularly in\r\nbones—phosphorus is present, and likewise in all animals. Nevertheless\r\nit is highly poisonous. It is usually obtained from the calcined bones\r\nof mammalia by obtaining _phosphoric acid_ by means of acting upon the\r\nbone-ash with sulphuric acid. Phosphorus when pure is colourless,\r\nnearly transparent, soft, and easily cut. It has a strong affinity for\r\noxygen. It evolves white vapour in atmospheric air, and is luminous;\r\nto this element is attributable the luminosity of bones of decaying\r\nanimal matter. It should be kept in water, and handled—or indeed not\r\nhandled—but grasped with a proper instrument.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is much used in the manufacture of lucifer matches, and we\r\nare all aware of the ghastly appearance and ghostly presentment it\r\ngives when rubbed upon the face and hands in the dark. In the ripples\r\nof the waves and under the counter of ships at sea, the phosphorescence\r\nof the ocean is very marked. In Calais harbour we have frequently\r\nnoticed it of a very brilliant appearance as the mail steamer slowly\r\ncame to her moorings. This appearance is due to the presence of\r\nphosphorus in the tiny animalculæ of the sea. It is also observable in\r\nthe female glow-worm, and the “fire-fly.” Phosphorus was discovered by\r\nBrandt in 1669.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386.—Manufacture of sulphuric acid.]\r\n\r\nIt forms two compounds with oxygen-phosphorous acid, H_{2}PO_{4}, and\r\nphosphoric acid, H_{3}PO_{4}. The compound with hydrogen is well marked\r\nas phosphuretted hydrogen, and is a product of animal and vegetable\r\ndecomposition. It may frequently be observed in stagnant pools, for\r\nwhen emitted it becomes luminous by contact with atmospheric air. There\r\nis a very pretty but not altogether safe experiment to be performed\r\nwhen phosphuretted hydrogen has been prepared in the following manner.\r\nHeat small pieces of phosphorus with milk of lime or a solution of\r\ncaustic potash; or make a paste of quick-lime and phosphorus, and\r\nput into the flask with some quick-lime powdered. Fix a tube to the\r\nneck, and let the other end be inserted in a basin of water. (_See_\r\nillustration, fig. 388.) Apply heat; the phosphuretted hydrogen will\r\nbe given off, and will emerge from the water in the basin in luminous\r\nrings of a very beautiful appearance. The greatest care should be\r\ntaken in the performance of this very simple experiment. _No water\r\nmust on any account come in contact with the mixture in the flask._ If\r\neven a drop or two find its way in through the bent tube a tremendous\r\nexplosion will result, and then the fire generated will surely prove\r\ndisastrous. The experiment can be performed in a cheaper and less\r\ndangerous fashion by dropping phosphate of lime into the basin. We\r\nstrongly recommend the latter course to the student unless he has\r\nhad some practice in the handling of these inflammable substances,\r\nand learnt caution by experience. The effect when the experiment is\r\nproperly performed is very good, the smoke rising in a succession of\r\ncoloured rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387.—(Phosphuretted hydrogen and marsh gas)\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisp.]\r\n\r\nSILICON is not found in a free state in nature, but, combined with\r\noxygen, as _Silica_ it constitutes the major portion of our earth,\r\nand even occurs in wheat stalks and bones of animals. As flint or\r\nquartz (see _Mineralogy_) it is very plentiful, and in its purest\r\nform is known as rock crystal, and approaches the form of carbon\r\nknown as diamond. When separated from oxygen, silicon is a powder of\r\ngreyish-brown appearance, and when heated in an atmosphere of oxygen\r\nforms silicic “acid” again, which, however, is not acid to the taste,\r\nand is also termed “silica,” or “silex.” It is fused with great\r\ndifficulty, but enters into the manufacture of glass in the form of\r\nsand. The chemical composition of glass is mixed silicate of potassium\r\nor sodium, with silicates of calcium, lead, etc. Ordinary window-glass\r\nis a mixture of silicates of sodium and calcium; crown glass contains\r\ncalcium and silicate of potassium. Crystal glass is a mixture of the\r\nsame silicate and lead. Flint glass is of a heavier composition. Glass\r\ncan be coloured by copper to a gold tinge, blue by cobalt, green\r\nby chromium, etc. Glass made on a large scale is composed of the\r\nfollowing materials, according to the kind of glass that is required.\r\n\r\nFlint glass (“crystal”) is very heavy and moderately soft, very white\r\nand bright. It is essentially a table-glass, and was used in the\r\nconstruction of the Crystal Palace. Its composition is—pure white\r\nsea-sand, 52 parts, potash 14 parts, oxide of lead, 34 parts = 100.\r\n\r\n  Plate Glass.                Crown Glass.

The ingredients melt\r\nand sink down into a clear fluid, throwing up a scum, which is removed.\r\nThis clear glass in the fused state is kept at a white heat till all\r\nair-bubbles have disappeared; the heat is then lowered to a bright\r\nredness, when the glass assumes a consistence and ductility suitable to\r\nthe purposes of the “blower.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388.—Experiment with phosphuretted hydrogen.]\r\n\r\nGlass blowing requires great care and dexterity, and is done by\r\ntwirling a hollow rod of iron on one end of which is a globe of\r\nmelted glass, the workman blowing into the other end all the time. By\r\nreheating and twirling a sheet of glass is produced. Plate glass is\r\nformed by pouring the molten glass upon a table with raised edges. When\r\ncold it is ground with emery powder, and then polished by machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389.—Crucibles.]\r\n\r\nMany glass articles are cast, or “struck-up,” by compression in moulds,\r\nand are made to resemble cut-glass, but they are much inferior in\r\nappearance. The best are first blown, and afterwards cut and polished.\r\nOf whatever kind of glass the article may be, it is so brittle that the\r\nslightest blow would break it, a bad quality which is got rid of by a\r\nprocess called “annealing,” that is, placing it while quite hot on the\r\nfloor of an oven, which is allowed to cool very gradually. This slow\r\ncooling takes off the brittleness, consequently articles of glass well\r\nannealed are very much tougher than others, and will scarcely break in\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390.—Plate-glass casting—bringing out the pot.]\r\n\r\nThe kind generally used for ornamental cutting is flint-glass.\r\nDecanters and wine-glasses are therefore made of it; it is very bright,\r\nwhite, and easily cut. The cutting is performed by means of wheels of\r\ndifferent sizes and materials, turned by a treadle, as in a common\r\nlathe, or by steam power; some wheels are made of fine sandstone, some\r\nof iron, others of tin or copper; the edges of some are square,or\r\nround, or sharp. They are used with sand and water, or emery and water,\r\nstone wheels with water only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391.—Glass furnace. (_See_ also fig. 390 for\r\ndetail.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392.—Glass-cutting.]\r\n\r\nIn a soluble form silicic acid is found in springs, and thus\r\nenters into the composition of most plants and grasses, while the\r\nshells and scales of “infusoria” consist of silica. As silicate\r\nof alumina,—_i.e._, clay,—it plays a very important _rôle_ in our\r\nporcelain and pottery works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBORON is found in volcanic districts, in lakes as boracic acid, in\r\ncombination with oxygen. It is a brownish-green, insoluble powder, in\r\na free state, but as boracic acid it is white. It is used to colour\r\nfireworks with the beautiful green tints we see. Soda and boracic acid\r\ncombine to make borax (or biborate of soda). Another and inferior\r\nquality of this combination is _tinkal_, found in Thibet. Borax is much\r\nused in art and manufactures, and in glazing porcelain. (Symbol B,\r\nAtomic Weight 11).\r\n\r\nSELENIUM is a very rare element. It was found by Berzilius in a\r\nsulphuric-acid factory. It is not found in a free state in nature. It\r\nclosely resembles sulphur in its properties. Its union with hydrogen\r\nproduces a gas, seleniuretted hydrogen, which is even more offensive\r\nthan sulphuretted hydrogen. (Symbol Se, Atomic Weight 79).\r\n\r\nTELLURIUM is also a rare substance generally found in combination with\r\ngold and silver. It is like bismuth, and is lustrous in appearance.\r\nTelluretted hydrogen is horrible as a gas. Tellurium, like selenium,\r\nsulphur, and oxygen, combines with two atoms of hydrogen. (Symbol Te,\r\nAtomic Weight 129).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393.—Casting plate-glass.]\r\n\r\nARSENIC, like tellurium, possesses many attributes of a metal, and on\r\nthe other hand has some resemblance to phosphorus. Arsenic is sometimes\r\nfound free, but usually combined with metals, and is reduced from\r\nthe ores by roasting; and uniting with oxygen in the air, is known\r\nas “white arsenic.” The brilliant greens on papers, etc., contain\r\narsenic, and are poisonous on that account. Arsenic and hydrogen unite\r\n(as do sulphur and hydrogen, etc.), and produce a foetid gas of a most\r\ndeadly quality. This element also unites with sulphur. If poured into\r\na glass containing chlorine it will sparkle and scintillate as in the\r\nillustration (fig. 395). (Symbol As, Atomic Weight 75).\r\n\r\nBefore closing this division, and passing on to a brief review of\r\nthe METALS, we would call attention to a few facts connected with\r\nthe metalloids we have been considering. Some, we have seen, unite\r\nwith hydrogen only, as chlorine; some with two atoms of hydrogen, as\r\noxygen, sulphur, etc., and some with three, as nitrogen and phosphorus;\r\nsome again with four, as carbon and silicon. It has been impossible\r\nin the pages we have been able to devote to the Metalloids to do more\r\nthan mention each briefly and incompletely, but the student will find\r\nsufficient, we trust, to interest him, and to induce him to search\r\nfarther, while the general reader will have gathered some few facts to\r\nadd to his store of interesting knowledge. We now pass on to the Metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig· 394—The manufacture of porcelain in China.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395.—Experiment showing affinity between arsenic\r\nand chlorine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE METALS.\r\n\r\n  WHAT METALS ARE—CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL PROPERTIES OF\r\n  METALS—CLASSIFICATION—SPECIFIC GRAVITY—DESCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have learnt that the elements are divided into metalloids and\r\nmetals, but the line of demarcation is very faint. It is very difficult\r\nto define what a metal is, though we can say what it is not. It is\r\nindeed impossible to give any absolute definition of a metal, except as\r\n“an element which does not unite with hydrogen, or with another metal\r\nto form a chemical compound.” This definition has been lately given by\r\nMr. Spencer, and we may accept it as the nearest affirmative definition\r\nof a metal, though obviously not quite accurate.\r\n\r\nA metal is usually supposed to be solid, heavy, opaque, ductile,\r\nmalleable, and tenacious; to possess good conducting powers for heat\r\nand electricity, and to exhibit a certain shiny appearance known as\r\n“metallic lustre.” These are all the conditions, but they are by\r\nno means necessary, for very few metals possess them all, and many\r\nnon-metallic elements possess several. The “alkali” metals are lighter\r\nthan water; mercury is a fluid. The opacity of a mass is only in\r\nrelation to its thickness, for Faraday beat out metals into plates so\r\nthin that they became transparent. All metals are not malleable, nor\r\nare they ductile. Tin and lead, for example, have very little ductility\r\nor tenacity, while bismuth and antimony have none at all. Carbon is a\r\nmuch better conductor of electricity than many metals in which such\r\npower is extremely varied. Lustre, again, though possessed by metals,\r\nis a characteristic of some non-metals. So we see that while we can\r\neasily say what is not a metal, we can scarcely define an actual metal,\r\nnor depend upon unvarying properties to guide us in our determination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.—Laminater.]\r\n\r\nThe affinity of metals for oxygen is in an inverse ratio to their\r\nspecific gravity, as can be ascertained by experiment, when the\r\nheaviest metal will be the least ready to oxidise. Metals differ in\r\nother respects, and thus classification and division become easier. The\r\nfusibility of metals is of a very wide range, rising from a temperature\r\nbelow zero to the highest heat obtainable in the blow-pipe, and even\r\nthen in the case of osmium there is a difficulty. While there can be no\r\nquestion that certain elements, iron, copper, gold, silver, etc., are\r\nmetals proper, there are many which border upon the line of demarcation\r\nvery closely, and as in the case of arsenic even occupy the debatable\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY is the relation which the weight of substance bears\r\nto the weight of an equal volume of water, as already pointed out in\r\nPHYSICS. The specific gravities of the metals vary very much, as will\r\nbe seen from the table following—water being, as usual, taken as 1:—\r\n\r\n  Aluminium        2·56\r\n  Antimony         6·7\r\n  Arsenic          6·\r\n  Bismuth          9·7\r\n  Cadmium          8·6\r\n  Calcium          1·5\r\n  Chromium         6·8\r\n  Cobalt           8·9\r\n  Copper           8·9\r\n  Gold            19·3\r\n  Indium           7·3\r\n  Iridium         21·1\r\n  Iron             7·8\r\n  Lead            11·3\r\n  Lithium         ·593\r\n  Magnesium       1·74\r\n  Manganese        8·\r\n  Mercury         13·5\r\n  Molybdenum       8·6\r\n  Nickel           8·8\r\n  Osmium          21·4\r\n  Palladium       11·8\r\n  Platinum        21·5\r\n  Potassium       ·865\r\n  Rhodium         12·1\r\n  Rubidium         1·5\r\n  Ruthenium       11·4\r\n  Silver          10·5\r\n  Sodium          ·972\r\n  Strontium        2·5\r\n  Thallium        11·8\r\n  Tin              7·2\r\n  Titanium         5·3\r\n  Tungsten        17·6\r\n  Uranium         18·4\r\n  Zinc             7·1\r\n  Zircon           4·3\r\n\r\nSome metals are therefore lighter and some heavier than water.\r\n\r\nThe table underneath gives the approximate fusing points of some of the\r\nmetals (Centigrade Scale)—\r\n\r\n  (Ice melts at 0°.)\r\n\r\n  Platinum[21]   about 1500°\r\n  Gold             ”   1200°\r\n  Silver           ”   1000°\r\n  Cast iron       1000-1200°\r\n  Wrought iron     ”   1500°\r\n  Copper           ”   1100°\r\n  Antimony         ”    432°\r\n  Zinc             ”    400°\r\n  Lead             ”    330°\r\n  Bismuth          ”    265°\r\n  Tin              ”    235°\r\n  Sodium           ”     97°\r\n  Potassium        ”     60°\r\n  Mercury          ”     40°\r\n\r\nThere are some metals which, instead of fusing,—that is, passing from\r\nthe solid to the liquid state,—go away in vapour. These are volatile\r\nmetals. Mercury, potassium, and sodium, can be thus distilled. Some do\r\nnot expand with heat, but contract (like ice), antimony and bismuth,\r\nfor instance, while air pressure has a considerable effect upon the\r\nfusing point. Some vaporise at once without liquefying; others, such as\r\niron, become soft before melting.\r\n\r\nALLOYS are combinations of metals which are used for many purposes, and\r\nbecome harder in union. Amalgams are alloys in which mercury is one\r\nconstituent. Some of the most useful alloys are under-stated:—\r\n\r\n  Name of Alloy.

We\r\nshall therefore mention only the most useful of the metals in this\r\nplace. We will commence with POTASSIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALS OF THE ALKALIES.\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM has a bright, almost silvery, appearance, and is so greatly\r\nattracted by oxygen that it cannot be kept anywhere if that element be\r\npresent—not even in water, for combustion will immediately ensue on\r\nwater; and in air it is rapidly tarnished. It burns with a beautiful\r\nviolet colour, and a very pretty experiment may easily be performed\r\nby throwing a piece upon a basin of water. The fragment combines with\r\nthe oxygen of the water, the hydrogen is evolved, and burns, and the\r\npotassium vapour gives the gas its purple or violet colour. The metal\r\ncan be procured by pulverizing carbonate of potassium and charcoal, and\r\nheating them in an iron retort. The vapour condenses into globules in\r\nthe receiver, which is surrounded by ice in a wire basket. It must be\r\ncollected and kept in naphtha, or it would be oxidised. Potassium was\r\nfirst obtained by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1807. Potash is the oxide of\r\npotassium, and comes from the “ashes” of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397.—Preparation of potassium.]\r\n\r\nThe compounds of potassium are numerous, and exist in nature, and by\r\nburning plants we can obtain potash (“pearlash”). Nitrate of potassium,\r\nor nitre (saltpetre), (KNO_{3}), is a very important salt. It is found\r\nin the East Indies. It is a constituent of gunpowder, which consists of\r\nseventy-five parts of nitre, fifteen of charcoal, and ten of sulphur.\r\nThe hydrated oxide of potassium, or “caustic potash” (obtained from the\r\ncarbonate), is much used in soap manufactories. It is called “caustic”\r\nfrom its property of cauterizing the tissues. Iodide, bromide, and\r\ncyanide of potassium, are used in medicine and photography.\r\n\r\nSoap is made by combining soda (for hard soap), or potash (for soft\r\nsoap), with oil or tallow. Yellow soap has turpentine, and occasionally\r\npalm oil, added. Oils and fats combine with metallic oxides, and oxide\r\nof lead with olive oil and resin forms the adhesive plaister with which\r\nwe are all familiar when the mixture is spread upon linen. Fats boiled\r\nwith potash or soda make soaps; the glycerine is sometimes set free\r\nand purified as we have it. Sometimes it is retained for glycerine\r\nsoap. Fancy soap is only common soap coloured. White and brown Windsor\r\nare the same soap—in the latter case browned to imitate age! Soap is\r\nquite soluble in spirits, but in ordinary water it is not so greatly\r\nsoluble, and produces a lather, owing to the lime in the water being\r\npresent in more or less quantity, to make the water more or less “hard.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398.—Machine for cutting soap in bars.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399.—Soap-boiling house.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM is not unlike potassium, not only in appearance, but in its\r\nattributes; it can be obtained from the carbonate, as potassium is\r\nobtained from its carbonate. _Soda_ is the oxide of sodium, but the\r\nmost common and useful compound of sodium is the chloride, or common\r\nsalt, which is found in mines in England, Poland, and elsewhere. Salt\r\nmay also be obtained by the evaporation of sea water. Rock salt is\r\ngot at Salzburg, and the German salt mines and works produce a large\r\nquantity. The _Carbonate of Soda_ is manufactured from the chloride of\r\nsodium, although it can be procured from the salsoda plants by burning.\r\nThe chloride of sodium is converted into sulphate, and then ignited\r\nwith carbonate of lime and charcoal. The soluble carbonate is extracted\r\nin warm water, and sold in crystals as soda, or (anhydrous) “soda ash.”\r\nThe large quantity of hydrochloric acid produced in the first part\r\nof the process is used in the process of making chloride of lime. A\r\nfew years back, soda was got from Hungary and various other countries\r\nwhere it exists as a natural efflorescence on the shores of some lakes,\r\nalso by burning sea-weeds, especially the common bladder wrack (_Fucus\r\nvesiculosus_), the ashes of which were melted into masses, and came\r\nto market in various states of purity. The bi-carbonate of soda is\r\nobtained by passing carbonic acid gas over the carbonate crystals. Soda\r\ndoes not attract moisture from the air. It is used in washing, in glass\r\nmanufactories, in dyeing, soap-making, etc.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Soda_ is “Glauber’s Salt”; it is also employed in\r\nglass-making. Mixed with sulphuric acid and water, it forms a freezing\r\nmixture. Glass, as we have seen, is made with silicic acid (sand),\r\nsoda, potassa, oxide of lead, and lime, and is an artificial silicate\r\nof soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHIUM is the lightest of metals, and forms the link between alkaline\r\nand the alkaline earth metals. The salts are found in many places in\r\nsolution. The chloride when decomposed by electricity yields the metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÆSIUM and RUBIDIUM require no detailed notice from us. They were first\r\nfound in the solar spectrum, and resemble potassium.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIUM is only a conjectural metal. _Ammonia_, of which we have\r\nalready treated, is so like a metallic oxide that chemists have come\r\nto the conclusion that its compounds contain a metallic body, which\r\nthey have named hypothetically AMMONIUM. It is usually classed amongst\r\nthe alkaline metals. The salts of ammonia are important, and have\r\nalready been mentioned. Muriate (chloride) of ammonia, or sal-ammoniac,\r\nis analogous to chloride of sodium and chloride of potassium. It is\r\ndecomposed by heating it with slaked lime, and then gaseous ammonia is\r\ngiven off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400.—Mottled soap-frames.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METALS OF THE ALKALINE EARTHS.\r\n\r\nBARIUM is the first of the four metals we have to notice in this\r\ngroup, and will not detain us long, for it is little known in a free\r\ncondition. Its most important compound is heavy spar (_sulphate of\r\nbaryta_), which, when powdered, is employed as a white paint. The oxide\r\nof barium, BaO, is termed baryta.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Baryta_ is used for “green fire,” which is made as\r\nfollows:—Sulphur, twenty parts; chlorate of potassium, thirty-three\r\nparts; and nitrate of baryta, eighty parts (by weight).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401.—Soda furnace.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCALCIUM forms a considerable quantity of our earth’s crust. It is the\r\nmetal of lime, which is the oxide of calcium. In a metallic state it\r\npossesses no great interest, but its combinations are very important to\r\nus. _Lime_ is, of course, familiar to all. It is obtained by evolving\r\nthe carbonic acid from carbonate of lime (CaO).\r\n\r\nThe properties of this lime are its white appearance, and it develops\r\na considerable amount of heat when mixed with water, combining to make\r\nhydrate of lime, or “slaked lime.” This soon crumbles into powder, and\r\nas a mortar attracts the carbonic acid from the air, by which means it\r\nassumes the carbonate and very solid form, which renders it valuable\r\nfor cement and mortar, which, when mixed with sand, hardens. Caustic\r\nlime is used in whitewashing, etc.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Lime_ (CaCO_{3}) occurs in nature in various forms, as\r\nlimestone, chalk, marble, etc. Calc-spar (arragonite) is colourless,\r\nand occurs as crystals. Marble is white (sometimes coloured by metallic\r\noxides), hard, and granular. Chalk is soft and pulverizing. It occurs\r\nin mountainous masses, and in the tiniest shells, for carbonate of lime\r\nis the main component of the shells of the crustacea, of corals, and\r\nof the shell of the egg; it enters likewise into the composition of\r\nbones, and hence we must regard it as one of the necessary constituents\r\nof the food of animals. It is an almost invariable constituent of\r\nthe waters we meet with in Nature, containing, as they always do, a\r\nportion of carbonic acid, which has the power of dissolving carbonate\r\nof lime. But when gently warmed, the volatile gas is expelled, and the\r\ncarbonate of lime deposited in the form of white incrustations upon the\r\nbottom of the vessel, which are particularly observed on the bottoms of\r\ntea-kettles, and if the water contains a large quantity of calcareous\r\nmatter, even our water-bottles and drinking-glasses become covered with\r\na thin film of carbonate of lime. These depositions may readily be\r\nremoved by pouring into the vessels a little dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nor some strong vinegar, which in a short time dissolves the carbonate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime_ (CaSO_{4}) is found in considerable masses, and\r\nis commonly known under the name of _Gypsum_. It occurs either\r\ncrystallized or granulated, and is of dazzling whiteness; in the latter\r\nform it is termed _Alabaster_, which is so soft as to admit of being\r\ncut with a chisel, and is admirably adapted for various kinds of works\r\nof art. Gypsum contains water of crystallization, which is expelled at\r\na gentle heat. But when ignited, ground, and mixed into a paste with\r\nwater, it acquires the property of entering into chemical combination\r\nwith it, and forming the original hydrate, which in a short time\r\nbecomes perfectly solid. Thus it offers to the artist a highly valuable\r\nmaterial for preparing the well-known plaster of Paris figures, and\r\nby its use the noblest statues of ancient and modern art have now\r\nbeen placed within the reach of all. Gypsum, moreover, has received a\r\nvaluable application as manure. In water it is slightly soluble, and\r\nimparts to it a disagreeable and somewhat bitterish, earthy taste. It\r\nis called “selenite” when transparent.\r\n\r\n_Phosphate of Lime_ constitutes the principal mass of the bones of\r\nanimals, and is extensively employed in the preparation of phosphorus;\r\nin the form of ground bones it is likewise used as a manure. It appears\r\nto belong to those mineral constituents which are essential to the\r\nnutrition of animals. It is found in corn and cereals, and used in\r\nmaking bread; so we derive the phosphorus which is so useful to our\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n_Chloride of Lime_ is a white powder smelling of chlorine, and is\r\nproduced by passing the gas over the hydrate of lime spread on trays\r\nfor the purpose. It is the well-known “bleaching powder.” It is also\r\nused as a disinfectant. The _Fluoride of Calcium_ is Derbyshire spar,\r\nor “Blue John.” Fluor spar is generally of a purple hue. We may add\r\nthat hard water can be softened by adding a little powdered lime to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAGNESIUM sometimes finds a place with the other metals, for it bears a\r\nresemblance to zinc. Magnesium may be prepared by heating its chloride\r\nwith sodium. Salt is formed, and the metal is procured. It burns very\r\nbrightly, and forms an oxide of magnesia (MgO). Magnesium appears in\r\nthe formation of mountains occasionally. It is ductile and malleable,\r\nand may be easily melted.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Magnesia_, combining with carbonate of lime, form the\r\nDolomite Hills. When pure, the carbonate is a light powder, and when\r\nthe carbonic acid is taken from it by burning it is called Calcined\r\nMagnesia.\r\n\r\nThe _Sulphate of Magnesia_ occurs in sea-water, and in saline springs\r\nsuch as Epsom. It is called “Epsom Salts.” Magnesium wire burns\r\nbrightly, and may be used as an illuminating agent for final scenes in\r\nprivate theatricals. _Magnesite_ will be mentioned among Minerals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTRONTIUM is a rare metal, and is particularly useful in the\r\ncomposition of “red-fire.” There are the carbonate and sulphate of\r\nstrontium; the latter is known as _Celestine_. The red fire above\r\nreferred to can be made as follows, in a _dry mixture_. Ten parts\r\nnitrate of strontia, 1½ parts chlorate of potassium, 3½ parts of\r\nsulphur, 1 part sulphide of antimony, and ½ part charcoal. Mix well\r\nwithout moisture, enclose in touch paper, and burn. A gorgeous crimson\r\nfire will result.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALS OF THE EARTHS.\r\n\r\nALUMINIUM (Aluminum) is like gold in appearance when in alloy with\r\ncopper, and can be procured from its chloride by decomposition with\r\nelectricity. It occurs largely in nature in composition with clays\r\nand slates. Its oxide, _alumina_ (Al_{2}O_{3}), composes a number of\r\nminerals, and accordingly forms a great mass of the earth. Alumina is\r\npresent in various forms (_see_ Minerals) in the earth, all of which\r\nwill be mentioned under Crystallography and Mineralogy. The other nine\r\nmetals in this class do not call for special notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY METALS\r\n\r\nIRON, which is the most valuable of all our metals, may fitly head\r\nour list. So many useful articles are made of it, that without\r\nconsideration any one can name twenty. The arts of peace and the\r\nglories of war are all produced with the assistance of iron, and its\r\noccurrence with coal has rendered us the greatest service, and placed\r\nus at the head of nations. It occurs native in meteoric stones.\r\n\r\nIron is obtained from certain ores in England and Sweden, and these\r\ncontain oxygen and iron (_see_ Mineralogy). We have thus to drive away\r\nthe former to obtain the latter. This is done by putting the ores in\r\nsmall pieces into a blast furnace (fig. 402) mixed with limestone\r\nand coal. The process of severing the metal from its ores is termed\r\nsmelting, the air supplied to the furnace being warmed, and termed the\r\n“hot blast.” The “cold blast” is sometimes used. The ores when dug from\r\nthe mine are generally stamped into powder, then “roasted,”—that is,\r\nmade hot, and kept so for some time to drive off water, sulphur, or\r\narsenic, which would prevent the “fluxes” acting properly. The fluxes\r\nare substances which will mix with, melt, and separate the matters to\r\nbe got rid of, the chief being charcoal, coke, and limestone. The ore\r\nis then mixed with the flux, and the whole raised to a great heat; as\r\nthe metal is separated it melts, runs to the bottom of the “smelting\r\nfurnace,” and is drawn off into moulds made of sand; it is thus cast\r\ninto short thick bars called “pigs,” so we hear of pig-iron, and\r\npig-lead. Iron is smelted from “ironstone,” which is mixed with coke\r\nand limestone. The heat required to smelt iron is so very great, that\r\na steam-engine is now generally employed to blow the furnace. (Before\r\nthe invention of the steam-engine, water-mills were used for the same\r\npurpose.) The smelting is conducted in what is called a blast furnace.\r\nWhen the metal has all been “reduced,” or melted, and run down to the\r\nbottom of the furnace, a hole is made, out of which it runs into the\r\nmoulds; this is called “tapping the furnace.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402.—Blast furnace.]\r\n\r\nSmelting is often confounded with melting, as the names are somewhat\r\nalike, but the processes are entirely different; in melting, the metal\r\nis simply liquefied, in smelting, the metal has to be produced from\r\nores which often have no appearance of containing any, as in the case\r\nof ironstone, which looks like brown clay.\r\n\r\nThe cone of the furnace, A, is lined with fire-bricks, _i_ _i_, which\r\nis encased by a lining, _l_ _l_; outside are more fire-bricks, and\r\nthen masonry, _m_ _n_; C is the throat of the furnace; D the chimney.\r\nThe lower part, B, is called the _boshes_. As soon as the ore in\r\nthe furnace has become ignited the carbon and oxygen unite and form\r\ncarbonic acid, which escapes, and the metal fuses at last and runs\r\naway. The coal and ore are continually added year after year. The\r\nglassy scum called “slag “ protects the molten iron from oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe metal drawn from the blast furnace is “pig iron,” or “cast” iron,\r\nand contains carbon. This kind of iron is used for casting operations,\r\nand runs into sand-moulds. It contracts very little when cooling. It is\r\nhard and brittle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403.—General foundry, Woolwich Arsenal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404.—Wire rollers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405.—Cutting edges.]\r\n\r\n_Bar Iron_ is the almost pure metal. It is remarkably tenacious, and\r\nmay be drawn into very fine wire or rolled. But it is not hard enough\r\nfor tools. It is difficult to fuse, and must be welded by hammering at\r\na red heat. Wire-drawing is performed by taking the metal as a bar,\r\nand passing it between rollers (fig. 404), which flattens it, and\r\nthen between a new set, which form cutting edges on the rolled plate\r\n(fig. 405), the projections of one set fitting into the hollows of the\r\nother closely as in the illustration. The strips of metal come out at\r\nthe aperture seen at A in the next illustration. These rods are drawn\r\nthrough a series of diminishing holes in a steel plate, occasionally\r\nbeing heated to keep it soft and ductile. When the wire has got to a\r\ncertain fineness it is attached to a cylinder and drawn away, at the\r\nsame time being wound round the cylinder over a small fire. Some\r\nmetals can be drawn much finer than others. Gold wire can be obtained\r\nof a “thickness” (or thinness) of only the 5,000th part of an inch,\r\n550 feet weighing one grain! But platinum has exceeded this marvellous\r\nthinness, and wire the 30,000th part of an inch has been produced.\r\nDuctility and malleability are not always found in the same metal in\r\nproportion. The sizes of wires are gauged by the instrument shown in\r\nthe margin. The farther the wire will go into the groove the smaller\r\nits “size.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406.—Rollers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407.—Wire size.]\r\n\r\nSteel contains a certain amount of carbon, generally about 1 to 2\r\nper cent. Cast steel is prepared from cast iron. Steel from bar-iron\r\nhas carbon added, and is termed bar-steel. The process is called\r\n“cementation,” and is carried on by packing the bars of iron in\r\nbrick-work boxes, with a mixture of salt and soot, or with charcoal,\r\nwhich is termed “cement.” Steel is really a carbide of iron, and Mr.\r\nBessemer founded his process of making steel by blowing out the excess\r\nof carbon from the iron, so that the proper amount—1·5 per cent.—should\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408.—Coarse wire-drawing.]\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the Bessemer process may be interesting. If a bar of\r\nsteel as soft as iron be made red-hot and plunged into cold water, it\r\nwill become very hard. If it be then gently heated it will become less\r\nhard, and is then fitted for surgical instruments. The various shades\r\nof steel are carefully watched,—the change of colour being due to\r\nthe varying thickness of the oxide; for we know that when light falls\r\nupon very thin films of a substance,—soap-bubbles, for instance,—the\r\nlight reflected from the under and upper surfaces interfere, and cause\r\ncolour, which varies with the thickness of the film. These colours in\r\nsteel correspond to different temperatures, and the “temper” of the\r\nsteel depends upon the temperature it has reached. The following table\r\nextracted from Haydn’s “Dictionary of Science” gives the “temper,” the\r\ncolour, and the uses of the various kinds of steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409.—Fine wire-drawing.]\r\n\r\n  Temperature |      Colour.      |           Uses of Steel.\r\n  Cent.  Fahr.|                   |\r\n  ------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------\r\n  220° = 430° | Faint yellow      | Lancets.\r\n  232° = 450° | Pale straw        | Best razors and surgical instruments.\r\n  243° = 470° | Yellow            | Ordinary razors, pen-knives, etc.\r\n  254° = 490° | Brown             | Small shears, scissors, cold chisels,\r\n                                     etc.\r\n  265° = 510° | Brown and purple  | Axes, pocket-knives, plane-irons, etc.\r\n                 spots\r\n  277° = 530° | Purple            | Table-knives, etc.\r\n  288° = 550° | Light blue        | Swords, watch-springs, etc.\r\n  293° = 560° | Full blue         | Fine saws, daggers, etc.\r\n  316° = 600° | Dark blue         | Hand and pit saws.\r\n\r\nThe _Bessemer_ process transfers the metal into a vessel in which\r\nthere are tubes, through which air is forced, which produces a much\r\ngreater heat than a bellows does. Thus in the process the carbon of the\r\niron acts as fuel to maintain the fusion, and at the same time by the\r\nbubbling of the carbonic acid mixes the molten iron thoroughly.\r\n\r\nDuring the bubbling up of the whole mass of iron, and the extreme\r\nelevation of temperature caused by the union of the carbon of the\r\nimpure iron with the oxygen of the air, the oxide of iron is formed,\r\nand as fast as it forms fuses into a sort of glass; this unites with\r\nthe earthy matters of the “impure” iron, and floats on the upper part\r\nas a flux, thus ridding the “cast iron” of all its impurities, with no\r\nother fuel than that contained in the metal itself, and in the air\r\nused. When the flame issuing from the “converter” contracts and changes\r\nits colour, then the time is known to have arrived when the iron is “\r\nde-carbonized.” The amount of carbon necessary is artificially added,\r\nebullition takes place, a flame of carbonic oxide comes out, and the\r\nmetal is then run into ingots.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of iron which are soluble in water have a peculiar\r\ntaste called _chalybeate_ (like ink). Many mineral springs are so\r\nflavoured, and taste, as the immortal Samuel Weller put it, “like warm\r\nflat-irons.” Iron is frequently used as a medicine to renew the blood\r\nglobules.\r\n\r\n_Protoxide of Iron_ is known only in combination.\r\n\r\n_Sesqui-Oxide of Iron_ is “red ironstone.” Powdered it is called\r\nEnglish _rouge_, a pigment not altogether foreign to our use. In a pure\r\nstate it is a remedy for arsenical poisoning, and is really the “rust”\r\nupon iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410.—Bessemer’s process.]\r\n\r\n_Bisulphide of Iron_ is iron pyrites, and is crystalline.\r\n\r\n_Chloride of Iron_ is dissolved from iron with hydrochloric acid. It is\r\nused in medicine.\r\n\r\n_Cyanide of Iron_ makes, with cyanide of potassium, the well-known\r\nprussiate of potash (ferro-cyanide of potassium), which, when heated,\r\nprecipitates Prussian blue (cyanogen and iron).\r\n\r\nThe _Sulphate of the Protoxide_ is known as copperas, or _green\r\nvitriol_, and is applied to the preparation of Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMANGANESE is found extensively, but not in any large quantities, in one\r\nplace; iron ore contains it. It is very hard to fuse, and is easily\r\noxidised. The binoxide is used to obtain oxygen, and when treated with\r\npotassium and diluted, it becomes the permanganate of potassium, and is\r\nused as “Condy’s fluid.” It readily oxides organic matters, and is thus\r\na disinfectant. It crystallizes in long, deep, red needles, which are\r\ndissolved in water. It is a standard laboratory test. There are other\r\ncompounds, but in these pages we need not detail them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOBALT and NICKEL occur together. They are hard, brittle, and fusible.\r\nThe salts of cobalt produce beautiful colours, and the chloride yields\r\nan “invisible” or sympathetic ink. The oxide of cobalt forms a blue\r\npigment for staining glass which is called “smalt.” Nickel is chiefly\r\nused in the preparation of German silver and electro-plating. The\r\nsalts of nickel are green. Nickel is difficult to melt, and always is\r\none of the constituents of meteoric iron, which falls from the sky in\r\naërolites. It is magnetic like cobalt, and is extracted from the ore\r\ncalled kupfer-nickel. A small United-States coin is termed a “nickel.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOPPER is the next metal we have to notice. It has been known for\r\ncenturies. It is encountered native in many places. The Cornish copper\r\nore is the copper pyrites. The fumes of the smelting works are very\r\ninjurious, containing, as they do, arsenic and sulphur. The ground near\r\nthe mines is usually bare of vegetation in consequence of the “smoke.”\r\nSheet copper is worked into many domestic utensils, and the alloy with\r\nzinc, termed _Brass_, is both useful and ornamental. _Red brass_ is\r\nbeaten into thin leaves, and is by some supposed to be “gold leaf”; it\r\nis used in decorative work. Bronze is also an alloy of copper, as are\r\ngun-metal, bell-metal, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411.—Native copper.]\r\n\r\nNext to silver, copper is the best conductor of electricity we have.\r\nIt is very hard and tough, yet elastic, and possesses malleability\r\nand ductility in a high degree. It forms two oxides, and there are\r\nseveral sulphides; the principal of the latter are found native, and\r\nworked as ores. The sulphate of copper is termed _blue vitriol_, and\r\nis used in calico-printing, and from it all the (copper) pigments are\r\nderived. It is also used in solution by agriculturists to protect wheat\r\nfrom insects. When copper or its alloys are exposed to air and water,\r\na carbonate of copper forms, which is termed _verdigris_. All copper\r\nsalts are poisonous; white of eggs is an excellent remedy in such cases\r\nof poisoning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEAD is obtained from galena, a sulphide of lead. It is a soft\r\nand easily-worked metal. When freshly cut it has quite a bright\r\nappearance, which is quickly tarnished. Silver is often present in\r\nlead ore, and is extracted by Pattison’s process, which consists in the\r\nadaptation of the knowledge that lead containing silver becomes solid,\r\nafter melting, at a _lower_ temperature than lead does when pure. Pure\r\nlead therefore solidifies sooner.\r\n\r\nOne great use of lead is for our domestic water-pipes, which remind us\r\nin winter of their presence so disagreeably. Shot is made from lead,\r\nand bullets are cast from the same metal. Shot-making is very simple,\r\nand before the days of breech-loading guns and cartridges, no doubt\r\nmany readers have cast bullets in the kitchen and run them into the\r\nmould over a basin of water or a box of sand. For sporting purposes\r\nlead is mixed with arsenic, and when it is melted it is poured through\r\na sort of sieve (as in the cut) at the top of a high tower. (_See_\r\nfigs. 413 and 414). The latter illustration gives the section of the\r\nshot tower; A is the furnace, B is the tank for melting the lead, and\r\nthe metal is permitted by the workman at C to run through the sieve\r\nin fine streams. As the lead falls it congeals into drops, which are\r\nreceived in water below to cool them. They are, of course, not all\r\nround, and must be sorted. This operation is performed by placing them\r\non a board tilted up, and under which are two boxes. The round shot\r\nrush over the first holes and drop into the second box, but the uneven\r\nones are caught lagging, and drop into box No. 1. They are accordingly\r\nsent to the furnace again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412.—Shot tower.]\r\n\r\nThe next process is to sort the good shot for size. This is done\r\nby sieves—one having holes a _little larger_ than the size of shot\r\nrequired. This sieve passes through it all of the right size and\r\nsmaller, and keeps the bigger ones. Those that have passed this\r\nexamination are then put into another sieve, which has holes in it a\r\n_little smaller_ than the size of shot wanted. This sieve retains the\r\nright shot, and lets the smaller sizes pass, and so on. The shot are\r\nsized and numbered, glazed by rolling them in a barrel with graphite,\r\nand then they are ready for use. Bullets are made by machinery by the\r\nthousand, and made up into cartridges with great speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413.—Sieve for making shot.]\r\n\r\nThe compounds of lead are also poisonous, and produce “colic,” to\r\nwhich painters are subject. Red lead, or minium, is a compound of the\r\nprotoxide and the binoxide, and may be found native. The former oxide\r\nis _litharge_; _white_ lead, or the _carbonate of lead_, is a paint,\r\nand is easily obtained by passing a stream of carbonic acid into a\r\nsolution of acetate of lead. It is used as a basis of many paints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414.—Section of shot tower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415.—Preparing lead for bullets.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN is another well-known metal. It is mentioned by Moses. It possesses\r\na silver-like lustre, and is not liable to be oxidised. The only really\r\nimportant ore is called Tinstone, from which the oxygen is separated,\r\nand the metal remains. Cornwall has extensive tin mines. Tin is\r\nmalleable and ductile, and can be beaten into _foil_ or “silver leaf,”\r\nor drawn into wire. It prevents oxidation of iron if the latter be\r\ncovered with it, and for tinning copper vessels for culinary purposes.\r\nThe Romans found tin in Cornwall, and the term “Stanneries” was applied\r\nto the courts of justice among the tin miners in Edward the First’s\r\ntime. We have already mentioned the alloys of tin. The oxides of tin,\r\n“Stannous” and “Stannic,” are useful to dyers. The latter is the\r\ntinstone (SnO_{2}). Sulphide of tin is called “Mosaic gold,” and is\r\nmuch used for decorative purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC is procured from _calamine_, or carbonate of zinc, and _blende_,\r\nor sulphide of zinc. It has for some years been used for many purposes\r\nfor which lead was once employed, as it is cheap and light. Zinc is a\r\nhard metal of a greyish colour, not easily bent, and rather brittle;\r\nbut when made nearly red-hot, it can be rolled out into sheets or\r\nbeaten into form by the hammer. Zinc is about six-and-three-quarter\r\ntimes heavier than water. Like many other metals, it is volatile\r\n(when heated to a certain extent it passes off into vapour), and the\r\nprobable reason that it was not known or used of old is that it was\r\nlost in the attempt to smelt its ores. Zinc is now obtained by a sort\r\nof distillation; the ores are mixed with the flux in a large earthen\r\ncrucible or pot.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the alloy of zinc with copper (brass), and the\r\nuse of zinc to galvanize iron by covering the latter with a coating\r\nof zinc in a bath is somewhat analogous to electro-plating. The metal\r\nis largely used as the _positive_ element in galvanic batteries, and\r\nfor the production of hydrogen in the laboratory. Zinc forms one oxide\r\n(ZnO), used for zinc-white. The sulphate of zinc is white vitriol, and\r\nthe chloride of zinc is an “antiseptic.” Certain preparations of the\r\nmetal are used in medicine as “ointments” or “washes,” and are of use\r\nin inflammation of the eyelids.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM. This “metallic element” is almost unknown in the metallic\r\nstate. But although little known, the beautiful colours of its\r\ncompounds make it a very interesting study. The very name leads one to\r\nexpect something different to the other metals—_chroma_, colour. The\r\nmetal is procured from what is known as chrome-ironstone, a combination\r\nof protoxide of iron and sesqui-oxide of chromium (FeOCr_{2}O_{3}). By\r\nignition with potassium we get chromic acid and chromate of potassium,\r\na yellow salt which is used to make the other compounds of chromium.\r\nThe metal is by no means easy to fuse.\r\n\r\nSesqui-Oxide of Chromium is a fine green powder employed in painting\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nChromate of Lead is termed “chrome yellow,” and in its varieties is\r\nemployed as a paint.\r\n\r\nChromate of Mercury is a beautiful vermilion. There are numerous other\r\ncombinations which need not be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416.—Type-casting.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIMONY was discovered by Basil Valentine. The Latin term is Stibium,\r\nhence its symbol, Sb. It is very crystalline, and of a peculiar\r\nbluish-white tint. It will take fire at a certain high temperature,\r\nand can be used for the manufacture of “Bengal Lights,” with nitre and\r\nsulphur in the proportions of antimony “one,” the others two and three\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of antimony are used in medicine, and are dangerous when\r\ntaken without advice. They act as emetics if taken in large quantities.\r\nOur “tartar emetic” is well known.\r\n\r\nAntimony, in alloy with lead and a little tin, form the _type metal_\r\nto which we are indebted for our printing. Type-casting is done by\r\nhand, and requires much dexterity. A ladle is dipped into the molten\r\nmetal, and the mould jerked in to fill it properly, and then the\r\ntype is removed and the mould shut ready for another type; and a\r\nskilful workman can perform these operations five hundred times in an\r\nhour,—rather more than eight times a minute,—producing a type each\r\ntime; this has afterwards to be finished off by others. The metal of\r\nwhich type is made consists of lead and antimony; the antimony hardens\r\nit and makes it take a sharper impression. The letters are first cut in\r\nsteel, and from these “dies” the moulds are made in brass, by stamping,\r\nand in these the types are cast.\r\n\r\nStereotype consists of plates of metal taken, by casting, from a\r\nforme of type set up for the purpose: an impression was formerly\r\ncarried on by plaster-of-Paris moulds, but lately what is termed the\r\n_papier-maché_ process is adopted. The paper used is now made in\r\nEngland, and the prepared sheet is placed upon the type and beaten\r\nupon it. Paste is then filled in where there are blanks, and another\r\nand thicker sheet of the prepared paper is placed over all, dried,\r\nand pressed. When this is properly done the paper is hardened, and\r\npreserves an impression of the type set up. The paper mould is then\r\nput into an iron box, and molten metal run in. In a very short time a\r\n“stereotype” plate is prepared from the paper, which can be used again\r\nif necessary. The metal plate is put on the machine.\r\n\r\nThere are several compounds of antimony, which, though valuable to\r\nchemists, would not be very interesting to the majority of readers. We\r\nwill therefore at once pass to the Noble Metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOBLE METALS.\r\n\r\nThere are nine metals which rank under the above denomination:—Mercury,\r\nSilver, Gold, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Osmium, Iridium.\r\nWe will confine ourselves chiefly to the first four on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY, or QUICKSILVER, is the first of the metals which remain\r\nunaltered by exposure to atmospheric air, and thus are supposed to earn\r\ntheir title of nobility. Mercury is familiar to us in our barometers,\r\netc., and is fluid in ordinary temperatures, though one of the heaviest\r\nmetals we possess. It is principally obtained from native cinnabar, or\r\nsulphide of mercury (vermilion), and the process of extraction is very\r\neasy. Mercury was known to the ancients, and is sometimes found native.\r\nIn the mines the evil effects of the contact with mercury are apparent.\r\n\r\nThis metal forms two oxides,—the black (mercurous) oxide, or suboxide\r\n(Hg_{2}O), and the red (mercuric) oxide, or red precipitate. The\r\nchlorides are two,—the subchloride, or calomel, and the perchloride,\r\nor corrosive sublimate. The sulphides correspond with the oxides; the\r\nmercuric sulphide has been mentioned. Its crimson colour is apparent in\r\nnature, but the Chinese prepare it in a particularly beautiful form.\r\nMany amalgams are made with mercury, which is useful in various ways\r\nthat will at once occur to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER is the whitest and most beautiful of metals, and its use for\r\nour plate and ornaments is general. It is malleable and ductile, and\r\nthe best conductor of electricity and heat that we have. It is not\r\nunfrequently met with in its native state, but more generally it is\r\nfound in combination with gold and mercury, or in lead, copper, and\r\nantimony ores. The mines of Peru and Mexico, with other Western States\r\nof America, are celebrated—Nevada, Colorado, and Utah in particular.\r\nThe story of the silver mine would be as interesting as any narrative\r\never printed. The slavery and the death-roll would equal in horror\r\nand in its length the terrible records of war or pestilence. We have\r\nno opportunity here to follow it, or its kindred metals with which\r\nit unites, on the sentimental side; but were the story of silver\r\nproduction written in full, it would be most instructive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417.—Native silver.]\r\n\r\nSilver is found with lead (galena), which is then smelted. The lead\r\nis volatilized, and the silver remains. It is also extracted by the\r\nfollowing process, wherein the silver and golden ore is crushed and\r\nwashed, and quicksilver, salt, and sulphate of copper added, while heat\r\nis applied to the mass. From tank to tank the slime flows, and deposits\r\nthe metals, which are put into retorts and heated. The mercury flies\r\noff; the silver and gold remain in bars.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, as in Saxony and South America, recourse is had\r\nto another process, that of amalgamation, which depends on the easy\r\nsolubility of silver and other metals in mercury. The ore, after being\r\nreduced to a fine powder, is mixed with common salt, and roasted at a\r\nlow red heat, whereby any sulphide of silver the ore may contain is\r\nconverted into chloride. The mixture is then placed, with some water\r\nand iron filings, in a barrel which revolves round its axis, and the\r\nwhole agitated for some time, during which process the chloride of\r\nsilver becomes reduced to the metallic state. A portion of mercury is\r\nthen introduced, and the agitation continued. The mercury combines\r\nwith the silver, and the amalgam is then separated by washing. It\r\nis afterwards pressed in woollen bags to free it from the greater\r\npart of the mercury, and then heated, when the last trace of mercury\r\nvolatilizes and leaves the silver behind.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Silver_ is obtained when metallic silver is dissolved in\r\nnitric acid. It is known popularly as _lunar caustic_, and forms the\r\nbase of “marking inks.” _Chloride of silver_ is altered by light, but\r\nthe iodide of silver is even more rapidly acted on, and is employed\r\nin photography. _Fulminating silver_ is oxide of silver digested in\r\nammonia. It is very dangerous in inexperienced hands. It is also\r\nprepared by dissolving silver in nitric acid, and adding alcohol. It\r\ncools in crystals. Fulminating mercury is prepared in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD is the most valuable of all metals,—the “king of metals,” as it\r\nwas termed by the ancients. It is always found “native,” frequently\r\nwith silver and copper. Quartz is the rock wherein it occurs. From the\r\ndisintegration of these rocks the gold sands of rivers are formed, and\r\nseparated from the sands by “washing.” In Australia and California\r\n“nuggets” are picked up of considerable size.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather soft metal, and, being likewise costly, is never used\r\nin an absolutely pure state. Coins and jewellery are all alloyed with\r\ncopper and silver to give them the requisite hardness and durability.\r\nGold is extremely ductile, and very malleable. One grain of gold may\r\nbe drawn into a wire five hundred feet in length, and the metal may be\r\nbeaten into almost transparent leaves 1/200000 of an inch in thickness!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418.—Native gold.]\r\n\r\nAqua-regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, is used to\r\ndissolve gold, which is solved only by selenic acid, though the free\r\nchlorine will dissolve it. Faraday made many experiments as to the\r\nrelation of gold to light. (_See_ “Phil. Trans.,” 1857, p. 145.) The\r\nvarious uses of gold are so well known that we need not occupy time\r\nand space in recording them. Gilding can be accomplished by immersing\r\nthe articles in a hot solution of chloride of gold and bicarbonate of\r\npotash mixed; but the electro process is that now in use, by which the\r\ngold precipitates on the article to be plated.\r\n\r\nWe have already described the process of electro-plating in the case\r\nof silvered articles, and we need only mention that electro-gilding is\r\nperformed very much in the same way. But gilding is also performed in\r\nother ways; one of which, the so-called water gilding, is managed as\r\nfollows. Gilding with the gold-leaf is merely a mechanical operation,\r\nbut water-gilding is effected by chemistry.\r\n\r\nWater-gilding is a process (in which, however, no water is used)\r\nfor covering the surface of metal with a thin coating of gold; the\r\nbest metal for water-gilding is either brass, or a mixture of brass\r\nand copper. A mixture of gold and mercury, in the proportion of one\r\npart of gold to eight of mercury, is made hot over a fire till they\r\nhave united; it is then put into a bag of chamois-leather, and the\r\nsuperfluous mercury pressed out. What remains is called an “amalgam”;\r\nit is soft, and of a greasy nature, so that it can be smeared over any\r\nsurface with the fingers. The articles to be gilt are made perfectly\r\nclean on the surface, and a liquid, made by dissolving mercury in\r\nnitric acid (aqua-fortis), is passed over them with a brush made of\r\nfine brass wire, called a “scratch-brush.” The mercury immediately\r\nadheres to the surface of the metal, making it look like silver; when\r\nthis is done, a little of the amalgam is rubbed on, and the article\r\nevenly covered with it. It is then heated in a charcoal fire till all\r\nthe mercury evaporates, and the brass is left with a coating of gold,\r\nwhich is very dull, but may be burnished with a steel burnisher and\r\nmade bright if necessary. In former times articles were inlaid with\r\nthin plates of gold, which were placed in hollows made with a graver,\r\nand melted in, a little borax being applied between.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of “chloride of gold” is mixed with ether, the ether\r\ntakes the gold away from the solution, and may be poured off the top\r\ncharged with it. This solution, if applied to polished steel by means\r\nof a camel-hair pencil, rapidly evaporates, leaving a film of gold\r\nadhering to the steel, which, when burnished with any hard substance,\r\nhas a very elegant appearance. In this way any ornamental design in\r\ngold may be produced, but it is not very durable. The gilt ornaments,\r\nscrolls, and mottoes on sword-blades, are sometimes done in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATINUM is the heaviest of all metals, gold being next. Platinum\r\nis practically infusible, and quite indifferent to reagents. It is\r\ntherefore very useful in certain manufactories, and in the laboratory.\r\nIt can be dissolved by _aqua-regia_. The stills for sulphuric acid are\r\nmade of platinum, and the metal is used for Russian coinage, but must\r\nbe very difficult to work on account of its infusible property.\r\n\r\nIn the finely-divided state it forms a gray and very porous mass, which\r\nis known as _spongy platinum_, and possesses the remarkable property\r\nof condensing gases within its pores. Hence, when a jet of hydrogen\r\nis directed upon a piece of spongy platinum, the heat caused by its\r\ncondensation suffices to inflame the gas. This singular power has been\r\napplied to the construction of a very beautiful apparatus, known as\r\nDöbereiner’s lamp, which consists of a glass jar, _a_, covered by a\r\nbrass lid, _e_, which is furnished with a suitable stop-cock, _c_,\r\nand in connection with a small bell jar, _f_, in which is suspended,\r\nby means of a wire, a cylinder of metallic zinc, _z_. When required\r\nfor use, the outer jar is two-thirds filled with a mixture of one\r\npart sulphuric acid and four parts water, and the stop-cock opened to\r\nallow the escape of atmospheric air, the spongy platinum contained\r\nin the small brass cylinder, _d_, being covered by a piece of paper.\r\nThe stop-cock is then closed, and the bell jar, _f_, allowed to fill\r\nwith hydrogen, and after it has been filled and emptied several times,\r\nthe paper is removed from the platinum and the cock is again opened,\r\nwhen the gas, which escapes first, makes the metal red-hot and finally\r\ninflames. This property of platinum is also used in the “Davy” lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419.—Döbereiner’s lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining metals do not call for detailed notice.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may refer to the following statement, which in\r\ngeneral terms gives the properties of the metals, their oxides and\r\nsulphides for ordinary readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE METALS.\r\n\r\n(Transcriber’s Note: The table has been divided into two parts to fit\r\nwithin width constraints)\r\n\r\nThe metals admit of being really distinguished by the following table,\r\nin which they are presented in several groups, according to their\r\npeculiar properties, and each distinguished by a particular name:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------\r\n  |                                     |\r\n  |               METALS.               |\r\n  |                                     |\r\n  --------------------------------------+\r\n  |     (A.) _Light Metals._            |\r\n  |                                     |\r\n  |Specific gravity from 0·8 to 1;      |\r\n  |  never occur in the uncombined      |\r\n  |  state.                             |\r\n  --------------------------------------+\r\n  |     (a.) _Alkaline Metals._         |\r\n  |                                     |\r\n  | 1.

The latter being met with chiefly in animal and vegetable\r\nmatter, as distinguished from dead or inert matter, was termed\r\n_Organic_.

In the section upon Electricity the\r\npositive and negative poles are explained. Oxygen appears always at\r\nthe positive pole, potassium at the negative. The other simple bodies\r\nvary. Chlorine, in combination with oxygen, is evolved at the negative\r\npole, but when with hydrogen at the positive pole. In the series below\r\neach element behaves electro-_negatively_ _to those following it_, and\r\nelectro-_positively_ to those _above it_; and the farther they are\r\napart the stronger their opposite affinities are.\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL RELATION OF THE ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n  Oxygen.\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n  Nitrogen.\r\n  Chlorine.\r\n  Bromine.\r\n  Iodine.\r\n  Fluorine.\r\n  Phosphorus.\r\n  Arsenic.\r\n  Carbon.\r\n  Chromium.\r\n  Boron.\r\n  Antimony.\r\n  Silicium.\r\n  Gold.\r\n  Platinum.\r\n  Mercury.\r\n  Silver.\r\n  Copper.\r\n  Bismuth.\r\n  Lead.\r\n  Cobalt.\r\n  Nickel.\r\n  Iron.\r\n  Zinc.\r\n  Hydrogen.\r\n  Manganese.\r\n  Aluminium.\r\n  Magnesium.\r\n  Calcium.\r\n  Strontium.\r\n  Barium.\r\n  Sodium.\r\n  Potassium.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these facts to science is unmistakable, and, indeed,\r\nmany attempts have been made to explain, from the electrical condition\r\nof the elements, the nature of chemical affinity, and of chemical\r\nphenomena in general.\r\n\r\nElectrotyping is another instance of decomposition by means of\r\nelectricity, and respecting decomposition by light we know how powerful\r\nthe action of the sun’s rays are upon plants, and for the evolution\r\nof oxygen. The daguerreotype and photographic processes are also\r\ninstances which we have commented upon. So we can pass directly to the\r\nconsideration of the compound groups.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every complex organic compound we have a relatively simple\r\none of great stability, which is termed the _radical_, which forms,\r\nwith other bodies, a compound radical.[22] In these complex groups we\r\nfind certain elements generally,—viz., carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,\r\nsulphur, and phosphorus. Some compounds may consist of two of these,\r\nbut the majority contain three (hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon). Many\r\nhave four (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen), and some more\r\nthan four, including phosphorus and sulphur. Others, again, may\r\ncontain chlorine and its relatives, arsenic, etc., in addition. Now\r\nwe will all admit that in any case in which carbon is present in\r\ncomposition with other simple bodies forming an organic body, and if\r\nthat body be ignited in the air, it burns and leaves (generally) a\r\nblack mass. This is a sure test of the presence of carbon, and forms\r\nan organic compound. Similarly in decomposition nitrogen and sulphur\r\nin combination inform us they are present by the odour they give off.\r\nWe need not go farther into this question of radicals and compound\r\nradicals than to state that a compound radical plays the part of\r\nan element in combination. We find in alcohol and ether a certain\r\ncombination termed _Ethyl_. This “compound radical” occurs in same\r\nproportions in ether, chloride of ethyl, iodide of ethyl, etc., as\r\nC_{2}H_{5}; so it really acts as a simple body or element, though\r\nit is a compound of carbon and hydrogen. A simple radical is easily\r\nunderstood; it is an element, like potassium, for instance. We may now\r\npass to the organic combinations classified into ACIDS, BASES, and\r\nINDIFFERENT, or NEUTRAL, BODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThere are several well-known organic acids, which we find in fruits\r\nand in plants. They are volatile and non-volatile; acids are sometimes\r\nknown as “Salts of Hydrogen.” We have a number of acids whose names are\r\nfamiliar to us,—viz., acetic, tartaric, citric, malic, oxalic, tannic,\r\nformic, lactic, etc.\r\n\r\n_Acetic acid_ (HC_{2}H_{4}O_{2}) is a very important one, and is easily\r\nfound when vegetable juices, which ferment, are exposed to the air, or\r\nwhen wood and other vegetable matter is subjected to the process of\r\n“dry distillation.” Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is distilled\r\nfrom wood, as we shall see presently. Vinegar is made abroad by merely\r\npermitting wine to get sour; hence the term _Vin-aigre_. In England\r\nvinegar is made from “wort,” of malt which is fermented for a few days,\r\nand then put into casks, the bung-holes of which are left open for\r\nseveral weeks, until the contents have become quite sour. The liquid is\r\nthen cleared by isinglass. The vinegar of commerce contains about 6 per\r\ncent. of pure acetic acid, and some spirit, some colouring matter, and,\r\nof course, water. Wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) is used for pickles.\r\nThe ordinary vinegar when distilled is called white vinegar, and it may\r\nalso be obtained from fruits, such as gooseberries or raspberries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420.—Vinegar ground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421.—Boiler or copper.]\r\n\r\nAcetic acid, or “wood vinegar,” is prepared as follows:—There are\r\nsome large iron cylinders set in brickwork over furnaces, and these\r\ncylinders have each a tube leading to a main pipe in which the liquid\r\nis received for condensation. The cylinders, which contain about seven\r\nor eight hundredweight, are filled with logs of wood, either oak,\r\nbeech, birch, or ash, the door is closely fastened, and the joints\r\nsmeared with clay; the fires are now lighted and kept up all day,\r\ntill the cylinders are red-hot; at night they are allowed to cool. In\r\nthe morning, the charcoal, into which the wood is now converted, is\r\nwithdrawn, and a fresh charge supplied; it is then found that about\r\nthirty or forty gallons of liquid has condensed in the main tube from\r\neach cylinder, the remainder being charcoal and gases which pass off;\r\nthe liquid is acid, brown, and very offensive, and contains acetic\r\nacid, tar, and several other ingredients, among which may be named\r\ncreosote; it is from this source all the creosote, for the cure of\r\ntoothache, is obtained. To purify this liquid it is first distilled,\r\nand this separates much of the tar; it is then mixed with lime,\r\nevaporated to dryness, and heated to expel the remaining tar and other\r\nimpurities; it is next mixed with sulphate of soda and water, and the\r\nwhole stirred together; the soda, now in union with the acetic acid,\r\nis washed out from the lime and strained quite clear; it is afterwards\r\nevaporated till it crystallises, and vitriol (sulphuric acid) then\r\nadded; finally the acetic acid is distilled over, and the sulphuric\r\nacid left in union with the soda, forming sulphate of soda, to be used\r\nin a similar process for the next batch of acid. The acetic acid is now\r\nquite colourless, transparent, and very sour, possessing a fragrant\r\nsmell. This is not pure acetic acid, but contains a considerable\r\nquantity of water. The acetic acid of commerce, mixed with seven times\r\nits bulk of water, forms an acid of about the strength of malt vinegar,\r\nperfectly wholesome, and agreeable as a condiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422.—Vinegar-cooling process.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423.—Tan-yard and pits.]\r\n\r\nPure acetic acid may be made by mixing dry acetate of potash with oil\r\nof vitriol in a retort, and distilling the acetic acid into a very cold\r\nreceiver; this, when flavoured with various volatile oils, forms the\r\naromatic vinegar sold by druggists. It is a very strong acid, and if\r\napplied to the skin will quickly blister it.\r\n\r\nAcetate of lead, or sugar of lead, is obtained by dissolving oxide of\r\nlead in vinegar. A solution of this salt makes the goulard water so\r\nfamiliar to all. Acetate of lead is highly poisonous.\r\n\r\nAcetate of copper is _verdigris_, and poisonous. Other acetates are\r\nused in medicine.\r\n\r\nWe may pass quickly over some other acids. They are as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTARTARIC ACID (C_{4}H_{6}O_{6}) is contained in grape juice, and\r\ncrystallizes in tabular form. The purified powdered salt is cream of\r\nTartar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRIC ACID (C_{6}H_{8}O_{7}) is found native in citrons and lemons, as\r\nwell as in currants and other fruits. It is an excellent anti-scorbutic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIC ACID (C_{4}H_{6}O_{5}) is found chiefly in apples, as its name\r\ndenotes (malum, an apple). It is prepared from mountain-ash berries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXALIC ACID (C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}). If we heat sugar with nitric acid we\r\nshall procure this acid. It is found in sorrel plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNIC ACID (C_{27}H_{22}O_{17}). It is assumed that all vegetables\r\nwith an astringent taste contain this acid. _Tannin_ is known for its\r\nastringent qualities. The name given to this acid is derived from the\r\nfact that it possesses a property of forming an insoluble compound with\r\nwater, known as _leather_. Tanning is the term employed. _Tannin_ is\r\nfound in many vegetable substances, but oak bark is usually employed,\r\nbeing the cheapest. The “pelts,” hides, or skins, have first to be\r\nfreed from all fat or hair by scraping, and afterwards soaking them\r\nin lime and water. Then they are placed in the tan-pit between layers\r\nof the bark, water is pumped in, and the hides remain for weeks,\r\noccasionally being moved from pit to pit, or relaid, so as to give\r\nall an equal proportion of pressure, etc. The longer the leather is\r\ntanned—it may be a year—the better it wears.\r\n\r\nSkins for gloves and binding are tanned with “sumach,” or alum and\r\nsalt. Sometimes the leather is split by machinery for fine working.\r\n_Parchment_ is prepared from the skins of asses, sheep, goats, and\r\ncalves, which are cleaned, and rubbed smooth with pumice stone.\r\n\r\nTannic acid, with oxide of iron, produces _Ink_, for the gall-nut\r\ncontains a quantity of the acid. All the black inks in use generally\r\nare composed of green vitriol (sulphate of iron) in union with some\r\nastringent vegetable matter; the best is the gall-nut, although, for\r\ncheapness, logwood and oak bark have each been used. An excellent black\r\nink may be made by putting into a gallon stone bottle twelve ounces of\r\nbruised galls, six ounces of green vitriol, and six of common gum, and\r\nfilling up the bottle with rain water; this should be kept three or\r\nfour weeks before using, shaking the bottle from time to time.\r\n\r\nBlue ink has lately been much used; it is made by dissolving\r\nnewly-formed Prussian blue in a solution of oxalic acid. To make it,\r\ndissolve some yellow prussiate of potash in water in one vessel, and\r\nsome sulphate of iron in another, adding a few drops of nitric acid to\r\nthe sulphate of iron; now mix the two liquids, and a magnificent blue\r\ncolour will appear, in the form of a light sediment; this is to be put\r\nupon a paper filter, and well washed by pouring over it warm water, and\r\nallowing it to run through; a warm solution of oxalic acid should now\r\nbe mixed with it, and the Prussian blue will dissolve into a bright\r\nblue ink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424.—Unhairing the hide.]\r\n\r\nRed ink is made by boiling chips or raspings of Brazil wood in vinegar,\r\nand adding a little alum and gum; it keeps well, and is of a good\r\ncolour. A red ink of more beautiful appearance, but not so durable,\r\nmay be made by dissolving a few grains of carmine in two or three\r\nteaspoonfuls of spirit of hartshorn.\r\n\r\nMarking ink is made by dissolving nitrate of silver in water, and then\r\nadding some solution of ammonia, a little gum water, and some Indian\r\nink to colour it. Printers’ ink is made by grinding drying oil with\r\nlamp-black.\r\n\r\nThe powdered gall-nut is an excellent test for iron in water. It will\r\nturn violet if any iron be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMIC ACID (CH_{2}O_{2}) is the caustic means of defence employed\r\nby ants, hence the term _formic_. It can be artificially prepared by\r\ndistilling a mixture of sugar, binoxide of manganese, and sulphuric\r\nacid. On the skin it will raise blisters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425.—Drying rooms for hides.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLACTIC ACID (C_{3}H_{6}O_{3}) is present in vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances. Sour whey contains it, and the presence of the acid in\r\nthe whey accounts for its power of removing from table-linen stains.\r\nWhen what is called “lactic fermentation” occurs, milk is said to be\r\n“turned.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBASES.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a base is not easy. We have described bases as\r\nsubstances which, combining with acids, form salts, but the definition\r\nof a base is as unsatisfactory as that of acid or salt. All vegetable\r\nbases contain nitrogen, are usually very bitter, possess no smell or\r\ncolour, and are insoluble in water. They are usually strong poisons,\r\nbut very useful in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe most important are the following bases:—\r\n\r\n\r\nQUININE is contained in the cinchona (yellow) bark. One hundred parts\r\nof the bark have been calculated to yield three of quinine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORPHINE is the poisonous base of opium, which is the juice of the\r\npoppy, and is prepared chiefly in India and China.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOTINE is the active principle of tobacco, and varies in quantity\r\nin different tobaccos. Havannah tobacco possesses the least. It is a\r\npowerful poison, very oily, volatile, and inflammable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIA is prepared from the hemlock. It is fluid and volatile. It is\r\nalso a deadly poison, and paralyses the spine directly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426.—Hemlock.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNINE is found in poisonous trees, particularly in the nux-vomica\r\nseeds of Coromandel. It produces lock-jaw and paralysis. There is no\r\nantidote for strychnine; emetics are the only remedy.\r\n\r\nThe above are chiefly remarkable for their uses in medicine, and in\r\nconsequence of their highly poisonous character are best left alone by\r\nunpractised hands.\r\n\r\nA German chemist, named Serturner, was the first to extract the active\r\nprinciple from Opium. The question of opium importation has lately been\r\nattracting much attention, and the opinions concerning its use are\r\ndivided. Probably in moderation, and when used by ordinary people (not\r\ndemoralized creatures), it does little harm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427.—The Poppy.]\r\n\r\nOpium is the juice of the “common” poppy, and derives its name from\r\nthe Greek _opos_, juice. The plant is cultivated in India, Persia,\r\nand Turkey. After the poppy has flowered the natives go round, and\r\nwith a sharp instrument wound, or puncture, every poppy head. This is\r\ndone very early in the morning, and under the influence of the sun\r\nduring the day the juice oozes out. Next morning the drops are scraped\r\noff. The juice is then placed in pots, dried, and sent for export.\r\nThe “construction” of opium is very complicated, for it contains a\r\nnumber of ingredients, the most important being morphia, narcotine,\r\nmeconic acid, and codeia. It is to the first named constituent that the\r\nsomnolent effect of opium is due.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nINDIFFERENT SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of so-called “indifferent” substances to which\r\nwe cannot be indifferent. Such bodies as these have neither acid nor\r\nbasic properties, and stand no comparison with salts. They are of great\r\nimportance, forming, as they do, the principal nutriment of animals.\r\nSome contain nitrogen, some do not; they may therefore be divided\r\ninto nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous substances; the former for solid\r\nportions of the body, the latter for warmth.\r\n\r\nWe will take the latter first, and speak of some of them—such as\r\nstarch, gum, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARCH is found in the roots of grain, in the potato, dahlia,\r\nartichoke, etc., and by crushing the parts of the plant, and washing\r\nthem, the starch can be collected as a sediment. In cold water and\r\nin spirits of wine starch is insoluble. The various kinds of starch\r\nusually take their names from the plants whence they come. Arrowroot is\r\nobtained from the West Indian plant _Maranta Arundinacea_. Cassava and\r\ntapioca are from the manioc; sago, from the sago palm; wheat starch,\r\nand potato starch are other examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 428.—Plantation of sugar-canes.]\r\n\r\nIf starch be baked in an oven at a temperature of about 300° it\r\nbecomes, to a great extent, soluble in cold water, forming what is\r\ncalled “British gum”; this is largely used for calico printing and\r\nother purposes; if boiled in water under great pressure, so that the\r\ntemperature can be raised to the same degree, it is also changed into\r\nan adhesive sort of gum, “mucilage”; this is the substance made use\r\nof by the government officials to spread over the backs of postage\r\nand receipt stamps to make them adhere. The starch of grain, during\r\ngermination, or growth, contains _diastase_, which converts the starch\r\ninto gum and sugar; the same effect can be produced by heating starch\r\nwith diluted sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUM found in plants is chiefly procured from the Mimosa trees, from\r\nwhich it flows in drops, and is called _Gum Arabic_. There are other\r\nso-called “gums,” but this is the one generally referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR exists in fruits, roots, and in the stalks of plants, in the\r\njuice of the cane, maple, and beet-root particularly. The canes are\r\ncrushed, the juice is clarified with lime to prevent fermentation, and\r\nthe liquid is evaporated. It is then granulated and cleared from the\r\nmolasses. Sugar, when heated, becomes dark, and is called “caramel.” It\r\nis used for colouring brandy, and gives much difficulty to the sugar\r\nrefiners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429.—Refining vacuum pan.]\r\n\r\nSugar refining is conducted as follows. The raw (brown) sugar is\r\nmixed into a paste with water, and allowed to drain. The sugar thus\r\nbecomes white. It is then dissolved in water, with animal charcoal and\r\nbullocks’ blood. The liquid is boiled, and put into a dark cistern with\r\nholes at the bottom, and cotton fibres being fastened in the holes,\r\nare hung into another dark cistern, into which the liquid runs pure\r\nand white. It is then pumped into a copper vessel,—vacuum pan,—and\r\ncondensed to the proper consistence. Subsequently it is poured into\r\nconical moulds, and pure syrup poured upon the crystal shapes. The\r\ncaramel is then removed through a hole at the end. The moulds or\r\nloaves are then dried, and if not even or elegant they are turned in\r\na lathe. Finally they are packed up as “loaf sugar.” Sugar undergoes\r\nno decomposition, and is the cause of non-decomposition in other\r\nsubstances. For this reason it is employed in “preserving” fruit, etc.\r\nSugar is obtained from beet by crushing and rasping the roots, as the\r\ncane is treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430.—Sugar moulds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431.—Turning the loaves.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRIT OF WINE, OR ALCOHOL, is not a natural product. It is found by\r\nthe decomposition of grape-sugar by fermentation. There is a series of\r\nalcohols which exhibit a regular gradation, founded, so to speak, upon\r\none, two, or three molecules of water. They are called respectively\r\nalcohols, glycols, and glycerins. Thus we have—\r\n\r\n  _Alcohols._\r\n\r\n  Methylic alcohol.\r\n  Ethylic     ”\r\n  Prophylic   ”\r\n  Amylic      ”\r\n\r\n  _Glycols._\r\n\r\n  Enthelein  glycol.\r\n  Prophylene   ”\r\n  Butylene     ”\r\n  Amylene      ”\r\n\r\n  _Glycerins._\r\n\r\n  (Ordinary Glycerine is the\r\n  only one known.)\r\n\r\nThe cetyl and melissylic alcohols are contained in spermaceti and\r\nbees-wax respectively. The usual alcohol is the _Vinic_, a transparent,\r\ncolourless liquid, which is the spirituous principle of wine, spirits,\r\nand beer, and when sugar is fermented the alcohol and carbonic acid\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nSpirits of wine has a very powerful affinity for water, and thus\r\nthe use of stimulants in great quantity is to be deprecated, for\r\nalcohol absorbs the water from the mucous membranes of the stomach\r\nand the mouth, making them dry and hard. The state of “intoxication,”\r\nunfortunately so familiar, is the effect produced by alcohol upon the\r\nnerves. We append a list of the beverages which are most in use, and\r\nthe percentage of alcohol in each according to Professor Hart:—\r\n\r\n  Port       15   per cent.\r\n  Madeira    14·5    ”\r\n  Sherry     14      ”\r\n  Claret      8      ”\r\n  Ale         6      ”\r\n  Porter      5      ”\r\n\r\nSpirit of wine is contained in many mixtures, and for the purpose of\r\nascertaining how much alcohol may be in wine, or any other liquid, a\r\nhydrometer is used (fig. 432). This instrument consists of a glass tube\r\nwith a bulb at the end. It is put into water, and the place the water\r\n“cuts” is marked by a line on the stem, and called zero 0°. Spirit of\r\nwine has less specific gravity than water, so in absolute alcohol the\r\ninstrument will sink lower than in water, and will descend to a point\r\nwhich is marked 100. In any mixture of alcohol and water, of course the\r\nhydrometer will rise or sink between the extreme points accordingly\r\nas the mixture may contain less alcohol or more. So a scale can be\r\nfurnished. The instrument, as described, was invented by MM. Gay-Lussac\r\nand Tralles, and called the “percentage” hydrometer. There are many\r\nother instruments marked in a more or less arbitrary manner. We append\r\na comparative table of a few hydrometers. (_See_ page 420.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432.—Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nETHER, or _sulphuric_ ether, is a mixture of spirits of wine with\r\nsulphuric acid, and distilled. It loses water, and the product\r\nis ether, which is volatile, and transparent, with a peculiarly\r\npenetrating odour.

These\r\ncompound crystals are termed _fulminating mercury_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now pass rapidly over the few remaining subjects we have to\r\nnotice, such as fats and soaps, wax, oils, etc.\r\n\r\nFats are of the greatest use to man, particularly in cold climates, for\r\nupon them depends the heat of the body. Fatty acid, if liquid, is known\r\nas oleic acid; if solid, stearic acid. Soaps are compounds of fatty\r\nacids. Many “fats” are consumed as food, others as fuel or for lighting\r\npurposes, in the shape of oils. Such oils are not primarily useful\r\nfor burning. Petroleum and other mineral oils are found in enormous\r\nquantities in America.\r\n\r\nThere are what we term fixed oils, and essential or volatile oils. A\r\nlist is annexed as given by “Hadyn’s Dictionary of Science”:—\r\n\r\nFIXED OILS.\r\n\r\n  _Drying._\r\n  Linseed oil.\r\n  Poppy oil.\r\n  Sunflower oil.\r\n  Walnut oil.\r\n  Tobacco-seed oil.\r\n  Cress-seed oil.\r\n\r\n  _Non-Drying._\r\n\r\n  Almond oil.\r\n  Castor oil.\r\n  Colza oil.\r\n  Oil of mustard.\r\n  Rape-seed oil.\r\n  Olive oil, etc.\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL OILS.\r\n\r\n  Oil of anise.\r\n  Oil of bergamot.\r\n  Oil of carraway.\r\n  Oil of cassia.\r\n  Oil of cedar.\r\n  Oil of cloves.\r\n  Oil of lavender.\r\n  Oil of lemon.\r\n  Oil of mint.\r\n  Oil of myrrh.\r\n  Oil of nutmeg.\r\n  Oil of peppermint.\r\n  Oil of rose.\r\n  Oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nVegetable oils are obtained by crushing seeds; animal oils come from\r\nthe whale and seal tribe. Paraffin oil comes from coal. Linseed is a\r\nvery drying oil, and on it depends the drying power of paint. We know\r\nolive oil will not dry on exposure to the air. Oiled silk is made\r\nwith linseed oil. When oil is drying in the air considerable heat is\r\nevolved, and if oiled substances be left near others likely to catch\r\nfire, spontaneous combustion may ensue. Oil of turpentine is found in\r\nthe pine and fir trees, and many of the oils above mentioned are used\r\nby perfumers, etc., the rose oil, or attar of roses, being an Eastern\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433.—Crushing mill.]\r\n\r\nAllied to the volatile oils are the RESINS, which are non-conductors of\r\nelectricity. They are vegetable products. They are soluble in alcohol,\r\nin the volatile oils, or in ether, and these solutions are called\r\n_varnishes_; the solvent evaporates and leaves the coating. Turpentine,\r\ncopal, mastic, shellac, caoutchouc, and gutta-percha are all resinous\r\nbodies. Amber is a mineral resin, which was by the ancients supposed to\r\nbe the “tears of birds” dropped upon the seashore. Moore refers to this\r\nin his poetic “Farewell to Araby’s Daughter”—\r\n\r\n    “Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber\r\n    That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept.”\r\n\r\nAmber is not soluble either in water or alcohol; it is, however,\r\nsoluble in sulphuric acid. It takes a good polish, and when rubbed is\r\nvery electrical. It is composed of water, an acid, some oil, and an\r\ninflammable gas, which goes off when the amber is distilled.\r\n\r\nThe well-known camphor is got from a tree called the “Laurus Camphora”;\r\nit is a white, waxy substance, and can be obtained by oxidizing certain\r\nvolatile oils. It is generally produced from the Laurus Camphora in a\r\n“still.” The behaviour of a piece of camphor in pure water is curious,\r\nbut its motions can be at once arrested by touching the water or\r\ndropping oil on the surface. This phenomenon is due to the surface\r\ntension of the liquid, which diminishes when it is in contact with the\r\nvapour of the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGENOUS SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThere are certain albuminous compounds which we must mention here.\r\nThese are albumen, fibrine, and caseine. Albumen is the white of egg;\r\nfibrine is, when solid, our flesh and muscular fibre, while caseine is\r\nthe substance of cheese. These are very important compounds, and the\r\nalbuminous bodies are of the very highest importance as food, for the\r\nsolid portion of blood, brain, and flesh consist, in a great measure,\r\nof them. Albumen, fibrine, and caseine contain carbon, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen, and oxygen, with sulphur and phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUMEN. The most familiar and the almost pure form of albumen is in\r\nthe white of eggs, which is albuminate of sodium. It also exists in\r\nthe _serum_ of the blood, and therefore it is largely found in the\r\nanimal kingdom. It can also be extracted from seed or other vegetable\r\nsubstances, but it is essentially the same. Albumen is very useful as\r\nan antidote to metallic poisons. It forms about 7 per cent. of human\r\nblood. It is soluble up to about 140° Fah.; it then solidifies, and is\r\nprecipitated in a white mass. Albumen is used in the purification of\r\nsugar, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBRINE is found in a liquid condition in blood. The vegetable fibrine\r\n(gluten) is prepared by kneading wheat flour in a bag till the washings\r\nare no longer whitened. Like albumen it is found both in a solid and\r\nliquid state.\r\n\r\n_Caseine_ is seen in the skin which forms upon milk when heated, and\r\nforms about 3 per cent. of milk, where it exists in a soluble state,\r\nowing to the presence of alkali; but caseine, like albumen, is only\r\nsoluble in alkaline solutions. As we have said, it is the principal\r\nconstituent of cheeses. Caseine is precipitated by the _lactic_ acid\r\nof milk, which is produced by keeping the milk too warm. Caseine, or\r\ncurds, as they are called, are thus precipitated. The milk is said to\r\nbe “sour,” or turned.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK, the food of the young of all mammalia, is composed chiefly of\r\nwater, a peculiar kind of sugar, butter, and caseine. It is this sugar\r\nin milk which causes the lactic acid mentioned above. The actual\r\nconstituents of milk are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Water                       873·00\r\n  Butter                       30·00\r\n  Sugar                        43·90\r\n  Caseine                      48·20\r\n  Calcium (phosphate)           2·31\r\n  Magnesia                      0·42\r\n  Iron                          0·07\r\n  Potassium (chloride)          1·44\r\n  Sodium                        0·24\r\n  Soda (with caseine)           0·42\r\n                             -------\r\n                             1000·00\r\n\r\nThe sugar of milk is non-fermenting, and can be procured from whey by\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSITION.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that animals and plants are composed of many different\r\nsubstances, and so it will be at once understood that these substances\r\ncan be separated from each other, and then the decomposition of the\r\nbody will be completed. When the sap sinks or dries up in plants they\r\nare dead. When our heart ceases to beat and our blood to flow we die,\r\nand then, gradually but surely, decay sets in. There is no fuel left\r\nto keep the body warm; cold results, and the action of oxygen of the\r\nair and light or water decays the body, according to the great and\r\nunalterable laws of Nature. “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou\r\nreturn,” is an awful truth. The constituents of our bodies must be\r\nresolved again, and the unfailing law of _chemical attraction_ is\r\ncarried out, whereby the beautiful organism, deprived of the animating\r\nprinciple, seeks to render itself into less complicated groups and\r\ntheir primary elements.\r\n\r\nThis resolution of the organic bodies is decomposition, or “spontaneous\r\ndecomposition,” and is called decay, fermentation, or putrefaction,\r\naccording to circumstances. The Egyptians, by first drying the bodies\r\nof the dead (and then embalming them), removed one great source of\r\ndecay—viz., water, and afterwards, by the addition of spices, managed\r\nto arrest putrefaction.\r\n\r\nFermentation is familiar in its results, which may be distilled for\r\nspirituous liquors, or merely remain fermented, as beer and wine. Fusel\r\noil is prepared from potatoes, rum from cane sugar, arrack from rice.\r\nThe power of fermentation exists in nature everywhere, and putrefaction\r\nis considered to be owing to the presence of minute germs in the\r\natmosphere, upon which Professors Tyndall and Huxley have discoursed\r\neloquently.\r\n\r\nPlants are subjected to a process of decomposition, which has been\r\ntermed “slow carbonization,” under certain circumstances which exclude\r\nthe air. The gases are given off, and the carbon remains and increases.\r\nThus we have a kind of moss becoming peat, brown coal, and coal. The\r\nimmense period during which some beds of coal must have lain in the\r\nground can only be approximately ascertained, but the remains found in\r\nthe coal-measures have guided geologists in their calculations.\r\n\r\nHaving already mentioned some products of distillation, we may now\r\nclose this portion of the subject and pass on to a brief consideration\r\nof minerals and crystals. We have left many things unnoticed, which in\r\nthe limited space at our disposal we could not conveniently include in\r\nour sketch of chemistry and chemical phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Cyanogen, ethyl, and cacodyl, are compound radicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n THE MINERALS—CHARACTERISTICS—CRYSTALS AND THEIR FORMS—DESCRIPTIONS OF\r\n MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALS are constituent parts of the earth. All parts of minerals are\r\nalike. There are simple minerals and mixed. The former are the true\r\nminerals, and are generally considered under the heading MINERALOGY.\r\nThe others constitute a branch of GEOLOGY, as they form aggregate\r\nmasses, and as such compose a large portion of the earth. We must learn\r\nto distinguish minerals and crystals as inorganic forms of nature. In\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms we have forms which are possessed of\r\norgans of sight, smell, taste, and certain structures indispensable\r\nto their existence and development. But in minerals we have no such\r\nattributes. They are INORGANIC, and have a similar structure; a\r\nfragment will tell us the story as well as a block of the same mineral.\r\nThese inorganic substances are possessed of certain attributes or\r\ncharacteristics. We find they have FORM. They have chemical properties,\r\nand they behave differently when exposed to light and electricity. They\r\nare generally solid. All the elements are found in the mineral kingdom,\r\nand a mineral may be an element itself, or a chemical combination of\r\nelements. These compounds are classed according as the combination is\r\nmore or less simple. An alliance of two elements is termed a _binary_\r\ncompound, of three a _ternary_ compound, forming a base and an acid.\r\n\r\nWe have learnt from our chemistry paper that there are between sixty\r\nand seventy elementary bodies in nature. When we speak of “elements,”\r\nwe do not mean to apply the popular and erroneous definition of the\r\nword. Earth, air, fire, and water are not elements; they are compounds,\r\nas we have seen. The list of elements has been given; we will now\r\ngive the names of the more important minerals. We have no space for a\r\ndetailed description, but in the British Museum the cases contain some\r\nhundreds, and the student will find them classified and described with\r\nthe greatest care, and according to the arrangement of Berzelius.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL MINERALS AS ARRANGED BY PROFESSOR ANSTED.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n  Diamond.\r\n  Graphite.\r\n  Anthracite.\r\n  Coal.\r\n  Lignite.\r\n  Bitumen.\r\n  Amber.\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n  Quartz.\r\n  Amethyst.\r\n  Agate.\r\n  Chalcedony.\r\n  Flint.\r\n  Jasper.\r\n  Opal.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  Sal-ammoniac.\r\n  Nitre.\r\n  Rock-salt.\r\n  Borax.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n  Witherite.\r\n  Spar.\r\n  Strontianite.\r\n  Celestine.\r\n  Calc-spar.\r\n  Marble.\r\n  Dolomite.\r\n  Fluor-spar.\r\n  Gypsum.\r\n  Apatite.\r\n  Magnesite.\r\n  Corundum.\r\n  Sapphire.\r\n  Emery.\r\n  Turquoise.\r\n  Alum-stone.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n  Cyanite.\r\n  Christolite.\r\n  Clay.\r\n  Fullers-earth.\r\n  Garnet.\r\n  Iolite.\r\n  Jade.\r\n  Emerald.\r\n  Beryl.\r\n  Felspar.\r\n  Obsidian.\r\n  Pumice.\r\n  Talc.\r\n  Serpentine.\r\n  Zircon.\r\n  Hornblende.\r\n  Asbestos.\r\n  Augite.\r\n  Diallage.\r\n  Topaz.\r\n  Tourmaline.\r\n  Lapis-lazuli.\r\n  Chrysoberyl.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n  Wolfram.\r\n  Molybdenite.\r\n  Chromite.\r\n  Pitch-blende.\r\n  Uranite.\r\n  Pyrolusite.\r\n  Wad.\r\n  Manganese-spar.\r\n  Arsenic.\r\n  Realgar.\r\n  Orpiment.\r\n  Antimony (grey).\r\n  Bismuth.\r\n  Blende.\r\n  Calamine.\r\n  Spartalite.\r\n  Tinstone.\r\n  Galena.\r\n  Pyromorphite.\r\n  Iron-pyrites.\r\n  Mispickel.\r\n  Magnetic iron ore.\r\n  Micaceous iron.\r\n  Hematite.\r\n  Spathic iron.\r\n  Cobalt.\r\n  Copper.\r\n  Oxides of copper.\r\n  Copper pyrites.\r\n  Azurite.\r\n  Malachite.\r\n  Mercury.\r\n  Cinnabar.\r\n  Silver.\r\n  Gold.\r\n  Platinum.\r\n  Palladium.\r\n\r\nThe above is the arrangement best suited for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Nichol prefers the following arrangement:—\r\n\r\nORDER I.—THE OXIDISED STONES.\r\n\r\n  Quartz.\r\n  Felspar.\r\n  Scapolite.\r\n  Haloid stones.\r\n  Leucite.\r\n  Zeolite.\r\n  Mica.\r\n  Serpentine.\r\n  Hornblende.\r\n  Clays.\r\n  Garnet.\r\n  Cyanite.\r\n  Gems.\r\n  Metallic stones.\r\n\r\nORDER II.—SALINE STONES.\r\n\r\n  Calc-spar.\r\n  Fluor-spar.\r\n  Heavy-spar.\r\n  Gypsum.\r\n  Rock-salt.\r\n\r\nORDER III.—SALINE ORES.\r\n\r\n  Sparry iron ores.\r\n  Iron salts.\r\n  Copper salts.\r\n  Lead salts.\r\n\r\nORDER IV.—OXIDIZED ORES.\r\n\r\n  Iron ores.\r\n  Tinstone.\r\n  Manganese ores.\r\n  Red copper ores.\r\n  White antimony ores.\r\n\r\nORDER V.—THE NATIVE METALS.\r\n\r\nORDER VI.—SULPHURETTED METALS.\r\n\r\n  Iron pyrites.\r\n  Galena.\r\n  Grey antimony ore.\r\n  Grey copper ore.\r\n  Blende.\r\n  Ruby-blende.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMABLES.\r\n\r\n  Sulphur.\r\n  Diamond.\r\n  Coal.\r\n  Mineral resins.\r\n  Combustible salts.\r\n\r\nThese are only a portion of the minerals, but it would be scarcely\r\ninteresting to give the list at greater length. In the foregoing we\r\nrecognize the metals and various combustible and non-combustible\r\nsubstances familiar to us, existing, as people say sometimes, in\r\n“lumps.” But if any one will take the trouble to examine a “lump,” he\r\nwill find the shape is definite and even. These regular forms of the\r\nminerals are called CRYSTALS, from the Greek word krustallos, _ice_.\r\nThe term was originally applied to quartz, for in olden times it\r\nwas thought that quartz was really congealed water. We can define a\r\ncrystal as “an inorganic solid bounded by plane surfaces arranged round\r\nimaginary lines known as _axes_.” It must not be imagined that crystals\r\nare small bodies; they may be of any size. There are crystals of many\r\nhundredweight; and although the usual crystal is comparatively small,\r\nit may be any size.\r\n\r\nCrystallization has occurred by cooling, or by other natural means;\r\nand we can form crystals by evaporation from certain salts deposited\r\nin water. So we may conclude also that the evaporation of water in the\r\nearly periods deposited many forms of crystals. We have crystals in the\r\nair, such as snowflakes, which are vapours crystallized. Carbon, when\r\ncrystallized, is the diamond. Boron is very like it. Oxygen cannot be\r\ncrystallized. Alumina makes sapphires and ruby with silica. Alumina\r\nand earth give us spars, tourmaline, and garnets. Limestone also has\r\nbeautiful forms, as in Iceland spar. Crystals, therefore, are certain\r\nforms of nature, corresponding in the inorganic kingdom to the animals\r\nand plants of the organic.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little more at these. Here we have a group of crystals\r\nof different forms. Earths are metals combined with oxygen, and the\r\nprincipal earths are alumina, lime, and silica. To these three we are\r\nchiefly indebted for the ground we live on, and from which we dig so\r\nmany useful metals and other minerals. Earths are coloured by the\r\nsubstances mixed with them. We can thus find copper, silver, gold,\r\nlead, etc., by noting the appearance of the soil. True earths are\r\nwhite. Strontia and baryta are also earths, and the latter is used\r\nin firework manufactories. Our chief assistants are ALUMINA, which\r\nfurnishes us with bricks and slate; LIME, which gives us marble or\r\nstones for building in a carbonate form. Quicklime, by which is meant\r\nlime freed from the carbonic acid, is well known; and plaster of Paris\r\nis only lime and sulphuric acid in combination. The SILICATES, such as\r\nsand and flint, are in daily demand. Agate, cornelian, Scotch pebbles,\r\nrock-crystal, etc., belong to the same family. Even our gems are\r\ncrystallized earths, and, as already stated, diamonds are merely carbon.\r\n\r\nStone, as we know, is quarried; that is, it is dug out of the earth.\r\nBut perhaps many readers do not know why a stone-mine is called a\r\n“quarry.” Most kinds of stone (granite and marble are the exceptions)\r\nare found in layers, or strata, rendering them easy of removal. The\r\nblocks of stone are cut with reference to these layers in a more or\r\nless square manner, and “squared up” before they are carried away. Thus\r\nthe term “quarry,” from an old French word, _quarré_, or _carré_, as\r\nnow written, signifying a square. In granite quarries the stone being\r\nvery hard is bored, and loosened by means of gunpowder or dynamite\r\nblasting. Slate, on the contrary, is easily divided into slabs. We will\r\nnow resume the subject of Crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                {1.—Emerald.      3.—Garnet.      5.—Diamond.\r\n  Fig. 434. {\r\n                {2.—Agate.        4.—Ruby.        6.—Rock crystal.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that crystals vary in size, and this variety may be traced,\r\nin the cases of crystallization from fluids, to the slowness or the\r\nrapidity of the cooling process. If the work be done slowly, then the\r\ncrystals obtain a size commensurate with the time of cooling, as they\r\nare deposited one upon the other. The form of minerals is the first\r\nimportant point, and to ascertain their forms and structure we must\r\nstudy CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. We shall find faces, or _planes_,—the lines of\r\ncontact of any two planes,—called _edges_, and the _angles_ formed\r\nwhere these planes meet. We may add that crystals have, at least, four\r\nplanes, making six edges and four angles. Nearly all crystals have\r\nmore than this, for the forms are, if not infinite, very numerous, and\r\nare divided into six (by some writers into seven) different systems or\r\nfundamental forms from which the varieties are derived. The axis of a\r\ncrystal is an imaginary line drawn from an angle to the opposite one.\r\n\r\nThe first form, the _monometric, or cubic system_, with three equal\r\naxes at right angles, is represented by fig. 436. This crystal is\r\nlimited by eight equilateral triangles. It has twelve edges and six\r\nangles. If we describe a line from any one angle to an opposite one,\r\nthat line is called an _axis_, and in the case before us there are\r\nthree such axes, which intersect each other at right angles.[23] Such\r\ncrystals are regular octohedra. There are irregular forms also, whose\r\naxes do not come at right angles, or they may be of unequal length.\r\nThe substances which we find crystallized in this form or system are\r\nthe diamond, nearly all metals, chloride of sodium (salt), fluor-spar,\r\nalum, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435.—Stone quarry.]\r\n\r\nWhen we say in this form we do not mean that all the minerals are\r\nshaped like the illustration (fig. 436). We shall at once see that the\r\nsystem admits of other shapes. For instance, a regular crystal may have\r\nbeen cut or rubbed (and the experiment can be made with a raw turnip).\r\nSuppose we cut off the angles in fig. 436; we then shall have a totally\r\ndifferent appearance, and yet the crystal is the same, and by cutting\r\nthat down we can obtain a cube (fig. 437). Take off its angles again we\r\nobtain a regular octohedron once more, as shown in the diagram opposite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 436.—Regular octahedron—first system.]\r\n\r\nWe will exhibit the gradations. Suppose we cut fig. 437; we will obtain\r\n(fig. 438) the cube. The next is merely the cube with angles and edges\r\ncut off; and if we proceed regularly we shall arrive at fig. 442, the\r\nrhombic dodecahedron, or twelve-sided figure, whose equal planes are\r\nrhombs.\r\n\r\nWe can, by taking away alternate angles or edges situated opposite,\r\narrive at other secondary crystals. From the original octohedron we\r\ncan thus obtain figs. 443 and 444. These are known as _tetrahedron_.\r\nThe _pentagonal dodecahedron_ is another secondary form (fig. 445).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437.—Octohedron angles removed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438.—The cube.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439.—Cube with angles removed.]\r\n\r\nThe cube, or hexahedron, the octohedron, and the rhombohedron are\r\nall simple forms, being each bounded by equal and similar faces, or\r\nsurfaces. We can thus understand how certain primary or original\r\nnatural forms of crystals can be changed in appearance by connection.\r\nOf the various substances crystallizing in this system we find salt,\r\niron pyrites, gold, silver, copper, and platinum, and the sulphide\r\nof lead called _galena_, in the cube or hexahedron form. The diamond\r\nand fluor-spar, alum, etc., appear in the first form (I), fig. 436\r\n(octohedron). The cube, we see, has six equal _faces_, eight equal\r\n_angles_, and twelve equal _edges_. Galena, as will be observed from\r\nthe illustration herewith, shows this peculiarity in a very marked\r\nmanner (fig. 446).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 440.—Another intermediate form of octohedron between figs. 436\r\n and 438.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441.—Cube deprived of edges and angles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 442.—Rhombic dodecahedron (garnet crystal).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 443 and 444.—Secondary forms of first system.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 445.—Pentagonal dodecahedron.]\r\n\r\nThe _second_ crystalline form is the HEXAGONAL, and in this system\r\nthree of the four axes are equal and in the same plane, inclined at an\r\nangle of 60°, with a principal axis at right angles to the others. In\r\ncrystals of this system are found quartz and calc-spar.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ system is termed the QUADRATIC or the _diametric_. This\r\nform has three axes, all at right angles, two being equal and the other\r\nlonger or shorter than the former two. In this system crystallize\r\nsulphate of nickel, zircon, oxide of tin, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446.—Galena, or sulphide of lead.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 447.—Oxide of tin.]\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_, or RHOMBIC system, or the _trimetric_. Here we have three\r\nrectangular axes, all unequal and intersecting at right angles. The\r\nsulphate and nitrate of potassium crystallize in this system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 448.—Rock crystal—second system.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 449 and 450.—Quadratic, or third system.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 451.—Prism of quadratic system.]\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ is the _oblique_, or MONOCLINIC system, which displays\r\nthree unequal axes, two of which are at right angles; the third, or\r\nprincipal axis, is at right angles to one and oblique to the other of\r\nthe preceding. Ferrous sulphate, tartaric acid, and gypsum crystallize\r\nin this system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 452.—Rhombic, or fifth system of crystals.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453.—Crystals of the fifth system.]\r\n\r\nThe _sixth_, or TRICLINIC system, or the _doubly oblique_. In this\r\nsystem we have three axes differing in length, and all forms which can\r\nbe arranged about these unequal and oblique axes. Sulphate of copper\r\nwill be found in this group. The system has been called anorthic, or\r\ntriclinic, because the axes are unequal and inclined, as in the oblique\r\nprism based upon an obliqued angled parallelogram. Axinite crystal, as\r\nannexed, will show one form in this system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 454.—Sixth system.]\r\n\r\nAs may be gathered from the foregoing, it is not easy to determine\r\na crystalline form with certainty,—a great part of the crystal may\r\nbe invisible. A crystalline mass is a mineral, which consists of an\r\narrangement of crystals heaped together. If it does not possess these\r\nthe mineral is _amorphous_, or shapeless. We will now endeavour to\r\ndescribe some of the physical characteristics of minerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 455.—Wollaston’s Goniometer, an instrument for\r\nmeasuring the angles of crystals.]\r\n\r\nThe GONIOMETER (_see_ fig. 455) is the instrument used for measuring\r\nthe angles of crystals. Wollaston’s reflecting instrument is most\r\ngenerally used. It consists of a divided circle, graduated to degrees,\r\nand subdivided with the vernier. The manner of working is easy, though\r\napparently complicated. The vernier is brought to zero, when an object\r\nis reflected in one face of the crystal. The crystal is turned till the\r\nsame object is viewed from another face. The angle of reflection is\r\nthen measured, and can be read off on the circle.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the physical characteristics of the\r\nminerals, and one of these attributes is _cohesion_. When we find a\r\nsubstance is difficult to break, we say it is “hard.” This means that\r\nthe cohesion of the different particles is very great. Minerals vary in\r\nhardness; some are extremely difficult to act upon by force, and a file\r\nappears useless. At the other side we find some which can be pricked\r\nor scratched with a pin; and these degrees of hardness being put as\r\nextremes, we can in a manner relatively estimate the hardness of all\r\nother minerals. We can test this by scratching one against another;\r\nwhichever scratches the other is the harder of the two, and thus by\r\ntaking up and discarding alternately, we can at length arrive at a\r\ncomparative estimate of the hardness of all. Such a scale was arrived\r\nat by Mohs, and arranged in the following order. The softest mineral\r\ncomes first:—\r\n\r\n   1. Talc.\r\n   2. Gypsum (rock-salt).\r\n   3. Calcareous spar.\r\n   4. Fluor-spar.\r\n   5. Apatite-spar.\r\n   6. Felspar.\r\n   7. Quartz.\r\n   8. Topaz.\r\n   9. Corundum.\r\n  10. Diamond.\r\n\r\nTalc, we see, is the softest, and diamond the hardest. Thus “diamond\r\ncut diamond” has passed into a proverb expressive of the difficulties\r\none “sharp” person has to circumvent or “cut out” another. Diamond\r\nis used by glass-cutters. When geologists wish to express the degree\r\nof hardness of any substance, they mention it with reference to the\r\nforegoing list; and if the substance be harder than fluor-spar, but\r\nnot so hard as felspar, they determine its hardness five, or perhaps\r\nbetween five and six, or between four and five, according as it is\r\nharder or less hard than apatite. Thus hardness, or power of cohesion,\r\nresistance to exterior force and pressure, is a prime characteristic of\r\nthe mineral kingdom. The file is the best test.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another phase of the physical character of our\r\nminerals—_cleavage_. This is the term employed to express the\r\nfacility of cutting in a certain direction which in the mineral is\r\nits direction of cleavage. Take mica, for instance. There is no\r\ndifficulty in separating mica into thin layers; we can do so with our\r\nfingers. The layers, or flakes, or laminæ are so arranged that they\r\nexhibit less cohesion in one direction than when tried in other ways.\r\nWe cut with the grain, as it were in the direction of the fibre when\r\nwood is concerned. Here we have another popular saying expressive of\r\nthis,—“against the grain,”—which signifies an act performed unwillingly\r\nand unpleasantly. Cleavability, therefore, means cutting with the\r\ngrain, as it were, and various minerals are possessed of different\r\ndegrees of cleavage. It sometimes happens that electric excitement is\r\nobserved when cleavage takes place. One place will become positive, and\r\nthe other negative. Mica, arragonite, and calcareous spar will exhibit\r\nthis action after cleavage or pressure. When a crystal of tourmaline\r\nis heated, it will develop positive electricity at one end of its\r\nprincipal axis, and negative at the other. Even if it be broken, the\r\nextremities of the fragments will exhibit similar phenomena, and so\r\nfar like a magnet, which, as we have seen, possesses this attribute\r\nof “polarity.” But a curious fact in connection with this is that, if\r\nthe heating cease the polarity ceases for a second or two, and yet as\r\ncooling goes on the polarity is restored, with the difference that the\r\npositive end has become negative, and the end previously negative has\r\ncome over to the opposite pole. Electricity, therefore, must be hidden\r\naway in every portion of our globe, and will some day be proved to be\r\nthe mainspring of all life.\r\n\r\n_Fracture_ in minerals is also to be noticed. Those substances which we\r\ncannot laminate we are obliged to break, and we may require to break a\r\nmineral in a direction different from or opposed to its direction of\r\ncleavage. Under such circumstances we must break it, disintegrate it,\r\nand observe the fracture. Sometimes we shall find the surfaces very\r\neven, or uneven, or what is termed _conchoidal_. This is observable in\r\nthe breaking of flint. There are various ways in which minerals display\r\nfracture, and the particular manner and appearance denotes the class to\r\nwhich the mineral belongs.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over the question of the specific gravity of minerals, as\r\nwe have in a former part explained this. It is important, however, to\r\nascertain the specific gravity. As a general rule, minerals containing\r\nheavy metals are of high specific gravity.\r\n\r\nBut the relation of minerals (crystals) with regard to light is of\r\ngreat interest and importance. When we were writing of polarization,\r\nwe mentioned the faculty a crystal has for double refraction, by which\r\nit divides a ray of light into two prolonged rays taking different\r\ndirections, the plane of vibration of one being at right angles to\r\nthat of the other. This property is not possessed by all crystals.\r\nSome act as ordinary transparent media. Some crystals transmit only\r\none polarized ray, and tourmaline is called a polarizer; and if light\r\nbe passed through it to another polarizer, it will be transmitted\r\nif the latter be similarly held; but if the second be held at right\r\nangles to it the ray will be stopped. We can easily understand this\r\nif we suppose a grating through which a strip of tin is passed; but\r\nthe strip will be stopped by bars at right angles to it. The coloured\r\nrings in crystals can be observed when a slice of a double refracting\r\ncrystal is examined. The rings are seen surrounding a black cross in\r\nsome instances, and a white cross in another. The effect when examined\r\nin the polariscope is very beautiful. Selenite is probably the best\r\ncrystal for exhibiting colours.\r\n\r\nMinerals sometimes reflect, sometimes refract light; they are said\r\nto possess lustre and phosphorescence. All these properties may\r\nbe considered as belonging to the crystals which are transparent,\r\nsemi-transparent, translucent, or opaque, according to the degrees\r\nin which they permit light to pass through them. All minerals are\r\nelectric or non-electric, and the variety can be ascertained by\r\nrubbing and placing the mineral near the electrometer. But all do\r\nnot exhibit magnetic properties. Taste and smell are strongly marked\r\nin some minerals—salts, for instance, and sulphur; some are soapy to\r\nthe touch, some appear cold to the fingers. Chemistry is very useful\r\nto us in determining the nature of the mineral, and the amount of it\r\nenclosed in the substance under examination. These delicate operations\r\nare termed qualitative and quantitative analysis. The application of\r\nheat is increased by means of the blowpipe, which is in effect a small\r\nbellows. We can thus, and particularly by means of the oxy-hydrogen\r\nblowpipe, obtain a very intense heat with little trouble. When the\r\nfragments of a mineral are held in the flame by platinum “tweezers,” or\r\ntongs, then the _fusibility_ of the substance, and the colour of the\r\nblow-pipe flame will be of great assistance in determining the nature\r\nof the mineral. It is also curious to observe the different forms into\r\nwhich the various substances expand or contract under the influence\r\nof the blowpipe. We may have a rugged slag, an enamel, or a glass,\r\nor a bead, or “drop” of metal. The varied substances produce various\r\ncolours—yellow, green, orange, or red, according to circumstances.\r\nStrontia is a vivid red, copper is green, lime orange, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 456.—The blowpipe.]\r\n\r\nIt is very little use to attempt a study of mineralogy without some\r\nacquaintance with chemistry. In dealing with minerals, and in studying\r\ngeology, we must try to keep our knowledge of chemical science in our\r\nminds, and thus fortified we can more easily understand the steps\r\nleading to the classification of minerals. It is impossible to teach\r\nmineralogy or geology from books. Nature must be studied, the specimens\r\nmust be seen, the earth must be examined. The advance in mineralogy may\r\nbe—probably will be—slow, but crystals will teach something; and when\r\nwe can pass a _viva voce_ examination in chemistry and crystallography,\r\nexpressing, by the symbols, the various substances under discussion, we\r\nshall have made a considerable advance in the science. We shall have\r\nan idea of the component parts of various substances, and be able to\r\nclass the various minerals according to their chemical constitution.\r\nBeginning with the metalloids, we shall pass to the metals and various\r\ncompounds, salts, resinous substances, etc., such as amber.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the space at our command to describe all the\r\nminerals, and yet it is necessary to enumerate the most important.\r\nWe may, therefore, take them in the following order. It should be\r\nadded that most of the simple minerals occur in comparatively small\r\nquantities, but sometimes we find them in aggregate masses (rocks). We\r\nappend a table.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPTICAL TABLE OF THE MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  First Class.—Metalloids.\r\n    Sulphur.\r\n    Boron.\r\n    Carbon.\r\n    Silicium (Silicon).\r\n\r\n  Second Class.—Light Metals.\r\n    Potassium.\r\n    Sodium.\r\n    Ammonium.\r\n    Calcium.\r\n    Barium.\r\n    Strontium.\r\n    Magnesium.\r\n    Aluminum.\r\n\r\n  Heavy Metals.\r\n    Iron.\r\n    Manganese.\r\n    Cobalt.\r\n    Copper.\r\n    Bismuth.\r\n    Lead.\r\n    Tin.\r\n    Zinc.\r\n    Chromium.\r\n    Antimony.\r\n    Arsenic.\r\n    Mercury.\r\n    Silver.\r\n    Gold.\r\n    Platinum.\r\n\r\n  Third Class.\r\n    Salts.\r\n    Earthy resins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHUR is found in Sicily and Italy and other parts of Europe, in\r\na native state, but as such has to be purified. The crystals take\r\nthe form as shown in the margin. Cleavage imperfect; it is brittle.\r\nSulphuric acid is a very important combination, and a very dangerous\r\none in inexperienced hands. Sulphur combines with a number of elements,\r\nwhich combinations are “Sulphides.” (_See_ Chemistry section.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 457.—Crystals of sulphur.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSELENIUM is a metalloid resembling sulphur, but less common. It is\r\ninodorous.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORON is usually found near volcanic springs, and in combination\r\nwith oxygen. It is soluble. Taste, acid bitter, and white in colour;\r\nfriable. It is known as SASSOLINE, or boracic acid. (_See_ Biborate of\r\nSoda for one of the borates.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON is one of the most important of our minerals. In the form of\r\ncoal we have it in daily use, and in the form of diamond it is our most\r\nvaluable gem. In the latter form it is the hardest of all minerals, a\r\npowerful refractor of light, lustrous, and transparent. It is found in\r\nthe East Indies and Brazil; more lately Cape diamonds have been brought\r\nto Europe, but they do not equal the Eastern gem. Almost fabulous\r\nprices have been given for diamonds, which, after all, are only carbon\r\nin a pure state. Another form of carbon is _graphite_ (plumbago, or\r\nblacklead). It is much used for pencils and in households. It is found\r\nin Cumberland, and in many other localities in Europe and Canada.\r\n\r\nCarbon appears in one or other of the above forms in regular\r\noctahedrons or their allied shapes. _Anthracite_, another form of\r\ncarbon, is used as fuel for strong furnaces. It leaves little “ash,”\r\nand is smokeless when burned. _Coal_, in all its forms, is evidently\r\nderived from wood. Thousands of years ago vegetable matter must\r\nhave been embedded in the ground and subjected to carbonization.\r\nThere are different kinds of coal, all of which come under one or\r\nother of the following heads: cubical coal, slate coal, cannel coal,\r\nglance-lignite,—the last being, as its name implies, an imperfect\r\ndevelopment of wood; it is a brown coal. We are not here concerned with\r\ncoal as a fuel. Charcoal is also a form of carbon prepared from wood\r\nand finds a counterpart in coke, which is prepared from coal. Carbon,\r\nas we have already seen, plays an important part in electric lighting\r\nand in the Voltaic Battery. Peat, or as it is called in Ireland,\r\n“turf,” is one of the most recent of the carboniferous formations.\r\nIt is much used as fuel. It is cut from moors (“bogs,” as they are\r\nsometimes called), and the various deposits can be traced. Bog-oak\r\nis no doubt the first step towards peat, as peat is the step towards\r\ncoal. The brown turf is newer than the black, and both kinds may be\r\nseen stacked in small square “bricks” along the Irish canals and in the\r\nyards of retailers of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 458.—Crystals of carbon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICON. Silica occurs generally in combination with alumina, and never\r\nin a free state. In combination with oxygen it is called silicic acid.\r\nSilica, when crystallized, is usually called _quartz_.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTZ has several varieties. We need only enumerate them, they will\r\nall be immediately recognized. We give illustrations of the crystals of\r\nquartz (fig. 459):—\r\n\r\n 1. Rock crystal appears in beautiful six-sided prisms.\r\n\r\n 2. Amethyst is coloured by protoxide of manganese, supposed by the\r\n ancients to be a charm against drunkenness.\r\n\r\n 3. Common quartz, or quartz rock, forms granite in combination, and is\r\n also known as “cat’s-eye,” “rose” quartz, etc.\r\n\r\n 4. Chalcedony, sometimes termed _cornelian_: used for seals, etc.\r\n\r\n 5. Flint: much used in potteries. “Flint and steel” have been\r\n superseded by phosphorus.\r\n\r\n 6. Hornstone: something like flint, resembling horn.\r\n\r\n 7. Jasper: of various colours; opaque and dull in appearance.\r\n\r\n 8. Silicious slate: a combination; used as a whetstone.\r\n\r\n 9. Agate: a mixture of quartz, amethyst, jasper, and cornelian; very\r\n ornamental.\r\n\r\n 10. Opal: a peculiar variety, containing water. It is not found in the\r\n form of crystal, but in vitreous masses. Its changeableness of hue is\r\n proverbial. The “noble” opal is much prized.\r\n\r\n 11. Smoky quartz, or cairngorm.\r\n\r\n 12. Onyx and Sardonyx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 459.—Quartz crystals in various forms.]\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at some minerals which contain metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM. This metal is so frequently combined in minerals with\r\nalumina that we may refer to it with the latter in sequel. There are\r\ntwo natural potassa salts—nitre, and sulphate of potassa. Nitre is\r\nknown as saltpetre, and is of great use in medicine. It is the chief\r\ningredient in the composition of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM. We have a number of minerals in this group—viz., _nitrate of\r\nsoda_ (nitratine), which occurs in large quantities in Peru; _rock\r\nsalt_, chloride of sodium, known as salt. It crystallizes in the cubic\r\nsystem. Colour usually white, but it occurs in secondary rocks in\r\ncompany with gypsum, etc. It is sometimes of a reddish colour, or even\r\ngreen and yellow. Biborate of soda is _borax_, and is found in and on\r\nthe borders of a Thibetian lake. There are several other combinations\r\nwith soda: the sulphates of soda—viz., thenardite and glauberite,\r\nanhydrous and hydrated respectively, carbonate of soda, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA combinations occur in lava fissures, and are not often met with\r\nin consequence of their volatile nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460.—Spar crystal.]\r\n\r\nCALCIUM. This forms an important group of the minerals, which are\r\nvery white in colour, and not very hard in substance. Calcium is the\r\nmetallic basis of lime. Fluoride of calcium, known as _fluor-spar_,\r\nmost frequently crystallizes in cubes in the first system. _Anhydrite_\r\nis the anhydrous sulphate of calcium. The hydrated sulphate is called\r\ngypsum. One variety of the hydrated sulphate is selenite, another is\r\nknown as alabaster. Apatite, or asparagus stone, and pharmacolite are\r\nin this group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Rhombohedron (_r_).\r\n  Primary rhombohedron (_r_).\r\n  Six-sided prism (_g_) regular.\r\n  Primitive rhombohedron (_r_), with acute form (_r½_).\r\n  Obtuse rhomtrahedron (_r½_), ending in prism (_g_).\r\n  Equal six-sided prism (_a_), ending in regular (_r_).\r\n  Obtuse rhombohedron.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 461.—CRYSTALS OF CARBONATE OF LIME.]\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of lime_, not content with one system of crystals, makes its\r\nappearance in two. It is therefore divided into two minerals—namely,\r\n_calcareous spar_ and _arragonite_. In the former it possesses various\r\nforms, as will be observed in the accompanying diagrams. It is a very\r\nimportant mineral, as will be readily acknowledged; it enters largely\r\ninto the composition of all shells and bones. The minute shells,\r\ndeposited by millions at the bottom of the sea, have combined to raise\r\nour chalk cliffs. Carbonate of lime is a constituent of water, as the\r\ndeposits at the bottoms of kettles, upon the sides and bottoms of\r\nwater-bottles, and the stalactites all testify. A little good vinegar\r\nwill quickly dissolve this deposit. Calc-spar is crystallized, and the\r\nIceland spar is celebrated. Marble, which is another form of carbonate\r\nof lime, is white, hard, and granular. It is sometimes varied, but the\r\npure white is the most valuable. Chalk, we know well, is soft, and is\r\nuseful for writing. We have also _aphrite_, schiefer spar,—compact\r\nlimestone in various forms,—and finally, _arragonite_, called from the\r\nplace of its nativity, Arragon,—a colourless and somewhat transparent\r\nvitreous crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARYTES. The sulphate of baryta is known as _heavy spar_; the crystals\r\nare of tabular forms, but numerous modifications exist. One of the\r\nforms is represented in the margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462.—Tabular form of heavy spar.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONTIUM is the metallic basis of strontia. Sulphate of strontium\r\nis _celestine_, the mineral which colours the blow-pipe flame a fine\r\ncrimson. There are certain varieties. Strontia salts are chemical\r\npreparations. A beautiful pyrotechnic “red fire” is produced by mixing\r\nnitrate of strontia with sulphur, antimony, charcoal, and chlorate of\r\npotassia.[24] There is a carbonate of strontia in the same crystalline\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNESIUM. With this metal we have a large group of minerals.\r\n_Magnesite_ is carbonate of magnesia, and occurs as talc-spar. The\r\nmagnesium limestone crystallizes as _bitter spar_. This dolomite\r\nis like marble or common limestone, according to colour. Talc is a\r\ncombination of magnesia with silicic acid. The hydrated carbonate is\r\ntermed “white magnesia.” The sulphate of magnesia is found in Siberia,\r\nand we have _boracite_, and native magnesia called _periclase_. The\r\nsulphate is generally present in mineral waters, such as the Seidlitz\r\nand Epsom Springs. Large masses have been found in the extensive\r\ncaverns of Kentucky and Tennessee, etc.\r\n\r\n_Meerschaum_ is a hydrated silicate of magnesia. It is found in\r\nAnatolia and Negropont, also in France and Australasia. Serpentine\r\nis another similar composition. It is found in Cornwall, where it is\r\ncarved into various ornaments. It is sometimes called snakestone.\r\nThere are many other hydrated silicates of magnesia—viz., gymnite,\r\npicrosmine, pycrophyll, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 463.—Crystal of augite.]\r\n\r\nThere is another family allied to magnesia, called AUGITES. These\r\nminerals are black or dark-green, and are contained in lava and basalt:\r\nAUGITE and HORNBLENDE are the chief representatives of this family. The\r\nformer crystallizes in the fourth system (_see_ fig. 463), and there\r\nare several varieties—diallage, bronzite, diopside, etc. HORNBLENDE\r\nbelongs to the same system, and is a large factor in the composition\r\nof gneiss, syenite, and porphyry. _Tremolite_ is a hornblende, and\r\n_asbestos_ (_amianthos_), and _mountain-cork_ are also varieties. The\r\nattribute of asbestos for sustaining heat is well known, and may be\r\nusefully employed for fire-proof purposes. The well-known _jade-stone_\r\nof China and _calamite_ are other varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464.—Alum crystals.]\r\n\r\nALUMINUM, or ALUMINIUM, gives us a large class of minerals. It is the\r\nmetallic basis of alumina, which, combined with silica, is the chief\r\ncomponent of our clay. Silicic acid and this base combine to form many\r\nminerals, and contains nearly all the precious stones. _Corundums_\r\nconsist of pure alumina, and crystallize in the hexagonal system. The\r\nfollowing stones are varieties of this mineral:—_Sapphire_, a beautiful\r\nblue; _ruby_, a red oriental; _topaz_, yellow oriental; _amethyst_,\r\nviolet; all being sapphires more or less. The finest crystals are found\r\nin the East Indies in the sands of rivers and diluvial soils. The\r\n_common corundum_ is very hard, and is used for polishing. _Emery_ is\r\nwell known, and is found in mica-slate. It is of a bluish-grey colour,\r\nand is also a polisher.\r\n\r\n\r\nALUM forms another family, of which we may first mention aluminite, a\r\n“basic sulphate” of alumina and found in small quantities. _Alum-stone_\r\nis found in Italy. _Alum_ occurs in large crystallized masses.\r\n(_See_ illustration, fig. 464.) There are different minerals with a\r\ncomposition very similar to alum, in which the potassa base of alum is\r\nsupplied by others. Thus we have the potassa alum, soda alum, manganese\r\nalum, ammonia alum—all being very nearly of the same constituents, and\r\nhaving similar crystals in the regular system, and are thus termed\r\nisomorphous, or similarly-formed. The potassa, or potash alum, is the\r\ncommonest form, and is found abundantly in England, on the Continent of\r\nEurope, and the United States. Soda alum is called _salfatarite_, and\r\nmagnesia alum _pickeringite_; manganese alum is _apjohnite_; phosphate\r\nof alumina is _wavellite_.\r\n\r\nThere are compounds of alumina and magnesia called SPINELS. They are\r\nhard minerals, and the same isomorphous changes take place with them as\r\nare observable with the bases of alum. There are therefore varieties\r\nsuch as the _spinel ruby_ found in the East Indies, very red in colour;\r\nthe _balas ruby_ not so red, and the orange-red, termed _rubicelle_.\r\nCeylon is remarkable for some fine specimens of spinels. _Chromite_ is\r\nlike the spinel, but is known as chrome iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nZEOLITES are principally compositions of silica and alumina. They\r\ncontain water, and are white, vitreous, and transparent. There are\r\nseveral varieties of them—natrolite, stilbite, etc. We will now pass on\r\nto the _Clays_, which are a very important family of the aluminum group.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of hard minerals which, when disintegrated, form\r\ncertain earthy masses. These we term clay, or clays, which possess\r\nvarious colours and receive certain names, according to the proportion\r\nof metallic oxides they contain. All clays have an affinity for water,\r\nand retain it to a very great extent. The earth has also a peculiar\r\nsmell. Clay is used in various ways; pottery, for instance, we read\r\nin the Bible as having been an employment from very ancient times.\r\nOne attribute of clays, the retention of water, is of the greatest\r\nuse to the world in providing moisture for plants and seeds. We may\r\nmention other characteristics of clay. It absorbs oil very quickly, and\r\ntherefore is useful for removing grease-spots. It cannot be burned,\r\nso we have fire-bricks and fire-clay in our stoves and furnaces.\r\nThere are various clays—pipe-clay, for instance, which is white;\r\npotters’ clay is coarser. There is porcelain clay as well as porcelain\r\nearth, of which more below. _Yellow ochre_ and _sienna_ are clays\r\nused by artists. _Bole_ is a reddish clay; and _tripoli_ is employed\r\nfor polishing. There are, besides, _andalusite_, or chiastolite and\r\ndisthene, crystalline forms of clay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPorcelain has been known to the Chinese for centuries. In 1701 it was\r\ndiscovered in Germany by Böttcher, a chemist, who while endeavouring\r\nto make gold by Royal command, found the porcelain, and was thereby\r\nenriched. Porcelain earth is frequently found; is known in many places\r\nas kaolin, and usually comes from the decomposition of felspar. But in\r\nCornwall we find it as decomposed granite, and the filtering process\r\ncan be viewed from the railway, while both gneiss and granulite have\r\nbeen known to yield kaolin. It is also found in China, Saxony, and\r\nFrance. It is free from iron, and when ground and mixed with silicic\r\nacid, it is handed to the potter or moulder. After the vessels have\r\nbeen dried in the air they are put into the kiln, and then become white\r\nand hard. After that they are glazed in a mixture of porcelain earth\r\nand gypsum, or ground flints and oxide of lead, made fluid with water\r\nin the glazing of earthenware. The vessel is then put into the furnace\r\nagain, or “fired,” as the process is called, and then comes out white,\r\nhard, and partly transparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 465.—Porcelain furnace.]\r\n\r\nEarthenware utensils are made of a coarser material,—clay and powdered\r\nflints,—from which all the gross matter has been eliminated. Flint\r\nis not difficult to break, if made hot and thrown into cold water. A\r\nstamper is then used to break the flints. They are first ground in a\r\nmill and purified like the clay, then they are mixed and beaten, while\r\nmoist, into “putty,” and turned, or forced, into moulds. The handles\r\nare fixed on afterwards. The ware is baked for two days and glazed. The\r\nvarious colours are obtained by mixing different clays and oxides—iron\r\nor manganese. Biscuit porcelain is made by pouring a creamy mixture of\r\nporcelain earth into plaster-of-Paris moulds, and when a thin case has\r\nformed within, the liquid is poured out again. It is then dried in the\r\nmould and shrinks. The mould is taken to pieces, and the thin biscuit\r\nporcelain is left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 466.—Stampers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 467.—Flint mill.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFELSPARS are very like the zeolites, except that the former contain no\r\nwater. Felspar crystallizes in a number of different forms. We annex\r\nillustrations of specimens. This spar is found in rocks, granite,\r\ngneiss, etc. One variety is the _moonstone_, of a peculiar lustre.\r\nFelsite is amorphous felspar. _Albite_ contains soda instead of potash.\r\n_Labradorite_ is nearly a pure lime felspar, and is remarkable for\r\nits colours, like a pigeon’s breast. _Spodumene_ is like albite, and\r\nleucite, soda-lite, etc., belong to this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 468.—Felspar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 469.—Felspar crystal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPIS-LAZULI is a felspar distinguished by its blue tint. It was used\r\nfor ultramarine colouring at one time, which colour can also be made\r\nchemically. Lapis-lazuli is found in Siberia and China. It is a mixture\r\nof mineral species. _Hauyne_ is something like it. _Obsidian_ is a sort\r\nof black glass, and occurs in various colours in vitreous masses. It is\r\nderived from the fusion of rocks, and is employed in the manufacture of\r\nboxes, etc. _Pumice stone_ bears a resemblance in composition to the\r\nforegoing, but is porous, and so called spongy. It contains both potash\r\nand soda in some quantities. _Pearlstone_ and _pitchstone_ also attach\r\nthemselves to this family group.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GARNETS possess many curious forms of crystals, which are coloured\r\nand used as gems. _Tourmaline_ is a very particularly useful crystal,\r\nand is used in the investigations concerning the polarization of\r\nlight. It is found of nearly all colours. The garnet and staurolite\r\ncrystals are shown (figs. 470, 471).\r\n\r\nThe former is silicate of alumina with the silicate of some other\r\noxide, which is not always the same. This change, of course, gives us a\r\nseries, as in the case of _alum_ above mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 470.—Garnet crystal.]\r\n\r\nThe red varieties, called _almandine_, or precious garnets, are\r\ndistinguished from the duller, “common” species by their clear colour.\r\nBohemia is the most productive soil for the garnets.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICA includes, as we have already noticed, a group of minerals which\r\nhave a peculiarly _laminated_ structure. These layers are by no means\r\nall alike, but they present a smoothness to the fingers which is\r\nhighly characteristic. The chief constituents are alumina and silica,\r\noccasionally with magnesia. Mica slate is very common, and is often\r\nused instead of glass in window-frames. _Muscovite_, _lepidolite_, and\r\n_phlogopite_ are all micas of the “potash,” “lithia,” and “magnesia”\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nIn the list of minerals associated with the lighter metals, we need\r\nonly now mention the _Gems_, so well known. These stones are very hard\r\nin many instances, infusible, and exhibiting beautiful colours. Amongst\r\nthem are diamonds, sapphires, and rubies, of which we have spoken; the\r\ntopaz, noticed under corundum. The chrysoberyl (of a pale green, or\r\noccasionally reddish hue), of which the alexandrite of Siberia is a\r\nvariety, is a compound of glucina with alumina; the beryl, a silicate\r\nof the same, and the emerald of beautiful green. Zircon is another gem,\r\nand “hyacinth” is its most valued form. The latter is found in basaltic\r\nrocks. The emerald crystallizes in the hexagonal system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471.—Staurolite crystal.]\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the minerals formed by the heavier metals, such as\r\nIron, Copper, Nickel, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON. This well-known metal fills a very important place in our mineral\r\narrangements, for the substances formed with iron ores occur in great\r\nvariety of structure, and occasionally in very large masses. They are\r\nhighly magnetic, and very hard. Were we here treating of iron as a\r\nmetal, we could give some information respecting its extraction and\r\nmanifold uses. All we need mention here is the fact that iron occurs\r\nin nature in various ores which are essentially composed of iron and\r\noxygen. The iron is extracted in the blast furnace, in which the\r\nprocess is continued for years. The “slag,” or glassy scum, protects\r\nthe molten iron from the air; its presence is necessary in all blast\r\nfurnaces. The most important of the iron group of minerals are MAGNETIC\r\nIRON (magnetite), or loadstone. This mineral occurs in Sweden and\r\nNorth America, and is found in primary rocks, and in Scandinavia forms\r\nmountains. It crystallizes in the regular (octahedron) system, and\r\noften in the form in illustration in the margin. It is highly magnetic,\r\nas its name implies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 472.—Magnetic iron.]\r\n\r\nNative iron very rarely occurs, and then only in thin layers. The most\r\nextraordinary specimens are those termed meteoric iron, which fall from\r\nthe atmosphere in great masses; and the meteoric stones, which contain\r\nninety per cent of iron, together with other constituents in small\r\nquantities—viz., nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, carbon, sulphur,\r\narsenic, etc.\r\n\r\n_Red hematite_ crystallizes in the hexagonal system. It possesses much\r\nthe same (chemical) constitution as corundum (_q. v._). It is brightly\r\nmetallic, and shows a red streak. It occurs in various forms, as\r\niron _glance_ or specular iron, which is found in Sweden and Russia;\r\nmicaceous iron, bloodstone, clay, ironstone, etc.\r\n\r\n_Brown hematite_ has not been found in crystals, but brown ironstone\r\n(fibrous) is crystalline. The earthy brown, containing clay, gives us\r\n_yellow ochre_ and _umber_. _Pea-iron ore_ and “_morass_” or “bog” ore\r\nalso belong to this class. _Limonite_ is the name given to these more\r\nrecent formations, of which yellow ochre is a pure specimen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 473.—Native oxide of iron.]\r\n\r\nThe combinations of iron with sulphur (pyrites) are also important.\r\n_Iron pyrites_ and _magnetic iron pyrites_ are two which may be\r\nmentioned. The latter first.\r\n\r\nMagnetic iron pyrites (or _pyrrhotin_) crystallizes in six-sided\r\nprisms, and is attracted by the magnet. The composition of this mineral\r\nhas not been exactly ascertained, and no chemical formula has been\r\nfound for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON PYRITES (bisulphide of iron) is known as _cubic pyrites_, _yellow\r\npyrites_, and _mundic_. It is generally found in the regular system\r\nof crystals, either as a cube or as a pentagonal dodecahedron. (_See_\r\nfirst system of crystals, _ante_.) Its colour is yellowish. It is\r\nknown also as _green vitriol_ when oxidised, and forms beautiful green\r\ncrystals (copperas). This salt is used in the preparation of Prussian\r\nblue and violet dyes. With gallic acid it makes ink.\r\n\r\nThere are many other “ferruginous” minerals, such as _vivianite_,\r\n_green ironstone_, white iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, or mispickel,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nA carbonate of iron, called _chalybite_, or spathic ironstone, is\r\nvery abundant in nature, and forms obtuse rhombohedrons. It is very\r\nuseful for the production of steel, as it forms the clay iron ore found\r\nin coal districts in combination. In a fibrous form it is known as\r\n_sphærosiderite_. It is a most useful mineral.\r\n\r\nChrome iron (chromite) is useful for the preparation of chromium\r\ncompounds. It crystallizes in the cubic system. It is magnetic,\r\nespecially when treated. Chromic acid forms scarlet “needle” crystals,\r\nand by its assistance chromate of lead, or _chrome yellow_, is\r\nprepared. (Chromate of lead is found in a native state as crocoisite).\r\n_See_ Chromium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGANESE is contained in several minerals. It usually occurs as an\r\noxide. It colours minerals variously. In a pure state manganese is\r\nwhite and brittle. The chief minerals are—\r\n\r\n_Pyrolusite_ (the binoxide of manganese of commerce) occurs in\r\ncrystals. It is black. It is used in the preparation of chlorine and\r\noxygen. The other minerals are known as _manganite_, which is also\r\nfound associated with pyrolusite, as are _hausmannite_ and _braunite_,\r\nthe other oxides.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICKEL and COBALT are generally found together, both being similar,\r\nand the minerals are compounds of arsenic or sulphur, and occur under\r\nsimilar circumstances. The principal are of NICKEL and of COBALT—\r\n\r\n  Sulphide of nickel (ullmanite).\r\n  Arsenical nickel (nickeline).\r\n  Nickel glance (gersdorffite).\r\n  Nickel pyrites (siegenite).\r\n  Arsenical cobalt (smaltine).\r\n  Cobalt glance (cobaltine).\r\n  Cobalt bloom (erythrine).\r\n  Cobalt pyrites (linnæite).\r\n\r\nNickel ores are used for extraction of the metal, which is used\r\nas a substitute for silver. The name is derived from the German,\r\n_kupfernickel_, or false copper. It was discovered in 1751.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER, again, forms a number of minerals, and the chief is the _red\r\noxide_ of the metal, called _cuprite_. It crystallizes in the cubic\r\nsystem. Its colour is red, and tinges a flame green. _Cuprite_ yields\r\nexcellent copper, and is found in Cornwall, and in many places on the\r\ncontinent. The _black_ oxide is rarely found. It is known as melaconite.\r\n\r\n_Malachite_ (carbonate of copper) is remarkable for its beautiful green\r\ncolour. In Australia it is worked for copper. It is chiefly ornamental.\r\nSiberia yields the finest specimens, but the mineral is found in\r\nCornwall and Cumberland, as well as on the continent. Chessylite (from\r\nChessy, in France) is frequently found with malachite. It has been\r\ncalled blue malachite, or the azure copper ore. It is used as a paint.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, copper unites with sulphur to form minerals, such\r\nas the needle ore (bismuthic sulphide of copper), antimonial sulphide,\r\nbournonite; purple copper, and copper pyrites, which is very abundant,\r\nand furnishes us with most of our copper. There is also the “grey”\r\ncopper ore, which contains various metals; even silver is obtained from\r\nit at times.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISMUTH gives us only a few minerals, of secondary importance. Native\r\nbismuth resembles antimony, but is reddish in hue. Bismuth ochre,\r\nbismuth blende, and bismuthine are the chief combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD is more important, and is obtained from _galena_, the sulphide\r\nof lead, which is very abundant, and the principal lead ore. It can\r\nbe at once distinguished by its high specific gravity and metallic\r\nlustre; the “cubic cleavage” also is very easy. It frequently is\r\nfound containing silver, and even gold, antimony, iron, etc. There\r\nare several suphantimonites of lead, such as zinkenite, geocronite,\r\netc., and the salts, such as sulphate of lead and white lead ore, or\r\ncarbonate of lead (cerasite). The chromate of lead is found in the Ural\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN is not found in a native state, but as _tinstone_, or binoxide\r\nof tin, named _cassiterite_. It is found largely in Cornwall, and\r\nthe mines there have yielded great quantities for generations. Tin\r\npyrites, a union of sulphides of tin, iron, and copper, is also found\r\nin Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC is produced from the ore called (zinc) blende, or sulphide of zinc\r\n(black Jack). Its colour is very variable, sometimes red, but when pure\r\nis greenish-yellow. It is also found black and brown. The red oxide of\r\nzinc (or spartalite) is also worked for zinc. The carbonate, or zinc\r\nspar, is common, and used to make brass, as is _calamine_, which is\r\npossessed of a remarkable lustre, and is even luminous when rubbed. It\r\nis a silicious oxide of zinc, and is found in the sedimentary rocks.\r\nWhen heated, it displays strong electric properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM occurs in very few mineral combinations; chromate of lead,\r\nchrome iron, and chrome ochre, or sesqui-oxide of chromium are the only\r\nimportant ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIMONY minerals are very hard; the tersulphide is the most common,\r\nand from this the metallic antimony is produced. Red antimony, the\r\noxide, is a rarer ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC resembles antimony, and occurs in combination with many\r\nmetals. White arsenic, or arsenious acid, is found in Bohemia, Alsace,\r\nTransylvania, etc. Orpiment and realgar are sulphides of arsenic, and\r\nare employed as colouring matters in paint and fireworks. Arsenic is\r\nvery poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY is occasionally found native, but more generally as _cinnabar_.\r\nChloride of mercury (or calomel) is found associated with the cinnabar,\r\nor hepatic ore. Cinnabar is easily volatilized, and possesses high\r\nspecific gravity. The Californian mines are very rich. Spain also\r\nproduces a large quantity. It is opaque, and carmine in colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER occurs native, or in ores. The latter are as follows:—The\r\nsulphide, or the vitreous silver (argentite); antimonial silver;\r\nand the combined sulphides, of antimony and silver. There are many\r\nsilver minerals, such as the chloride (horn silver, or kerargyrite),\r\nbromide, and carbonate of silver, bismuthic silver, etc. The bromide\r\nand iodide are bromargyrite and iodargyrite. Silver occurs most\r\nfrequently associated with gold; natural alloys of these two metals are\r\nfound, containing from 0·16 to 38·7 per cent. of silver, which causes\r\nconsiderable variations both of colour and density. In addition to this\r\nalloy, we may mention _sylvanite_ (graphic tellurium), which contains,\r\nbesides gold and silver, one of the rarer metals—viz., tellurium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474.—Gold crystals.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD is our most precious mineral, and is generally found native. It\r\nexists in sand and in certain rocks. It crystallizes in various forms,\r\nand in Mexico it is found in companionship with silver and copper\r\nsulphides. Australia and California render the most valuable supplies\r\nof the metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATINUM is also found native, and rarely is crystals. It is often\r\nalloyed with other metals, chiefly with iron or gold; also with\r\ndiamonds. We have already considered it as a metal. Little remains\r\nto be said about _salts_ and _resins_, for with the exception of\r\nthose we have referred to under Chemistry, they are of little value.\r\nThe bitumens, rock oil, etc., which exude from the earth, are very\r\nuseful, and as asphalt and petroleum play an important part in the\r\ncivilized world, but scarcely come under the strict rule of minerals\r\nas we consider them, and with this reference we close our sketch of\r\nMineralogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] A crystal should be held so that one of its axes is vertical to\r\nthe spectator. This axis is termed the principal axis, and when there\r\nis inequality the longest axis is the principal.\r\n\r\n[24] _See_ “Strontium” in Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nNEW LOCOMOTIVE APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\n THE KITE—THE AEROPHANE—ICE YACHTS—SAILING TRUCKS—WATER VELOCIPEDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kite, known from the earliest times, and constructed by a number\r\nof people, is a very familiar object, which we shall not describe; for\r\nwe will now speak of some similar appliances of a more interesting and\r\nuncommon description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475.—Mr. Penaud’s “High-flier.”]\r\n\r\nM. Penaud has invented some appliances in which twisted india-rubber\r\nis the principal agent. Fig. 475 represents a sort of kite, which\r\nrises in the air if one twists and then looses the india-rubber round\r\nthe central bow. Fig. 476 represents another kind of invention; it is\r\nan “aerophane,” with a screw at the back, so fixed that it receives\r\nno shock from striking against any obstacle. After having twisted the\r\nindia-rubber, and loosened our hold of the apparatus in a horizontal\r\nposition, it will first descend for an instant, then, acquiring\r\nincreased speed, it rises seven or eight feet from the ground, and\r\ndescribes a regular movement in the air for a distance of about fifty\r\nyards; the motion lasts for several seconds.\r\n\r\nSome models have also been constructed capable of traversing a distance\r\nof over seventy yards, remaining for thirteen seconds in the air, as\r\nlightly poised as a bird, and without any connection with the ground.\r\nDuring the whole time the rudder restrains with perfect exactitude the\r\nascending and descending movements as they occur; and we can plainly\r\nobserve the various oscillations like those of sparrows, or more\r\nespecially woodpeckers. At last, when the movements are coming to an\r\nend, the apparatus falls gently to the ground in a slanting line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 476.—M. Penaud’s “Aerophane.”]\r\n\r\nM. Penaud has also succeeded in constructing a mechanical bird, that\r\nwe have seen set in motion, which will continue flying for several\r\nseconds; we give an illustration of it in fig. 477.\r\n\r\nAnother scientist, M. Tatin, has also produced some remarkable results.\r\nHis efforts have been unceasingly directed towards the reproduction of\r\nthe flight of a bird by means of more or less complicated arrangements.\r\nHe has endeavoured to discover in the small appliances made with\r\nindiarubber, and used by MM. Penaud and Hureau de Villeneuve, what\r\nwere the best shapes in which to reproduce the wings, in order to adapt\r\nthem to a large apparatus acting by compressed air. After several\r\nattempts, he decided on the employment of long, narrow wings. Wenham\r\nhad previously proved that a wing may be equally effectual whether\r\nit be narrow or wide, and M. Marcy has also declared that birds with\r\na quick, narrow wing-stroke have always very long wings. By means of\r\nthese long, narrow wings (fig. 478) M. Tatin has reduced the time\r\nduring which the wing reaches a suitable position for acting on the air\r\nwhen it first descends. Granted the fact, so long established, that a\r\nbird flies more easily if it rests its wing against a great volume of\r\nair, it will be understood that the maximum speed of movement will also\r\nbe the most advantageous as regards the reduction of expended force.\r\nThe inventor, finding that he could not prevent his mechanical birds\r\nfrom losing force in proportion as they attained considerable speed,\r\nremedied this defect by _placing the centre of gravity in front_.\r\nIn consequence of this, the bird in full flight preserves the same\r\nequilibrium as the bird hovering in the air, and its speed is, to a\r\ncertain extent, passive, the mass of air pressing of its own accord\r\nagainst the wings, all expenditure of force therefore being utilized\r\nfor suspension. Thus has M. Tatin been enabled to increase the weight\r\nof his appliances, without increasing the motive power, and yet obtains\r\na double course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 477.—Mechanical bird.]\r\n\r\nThe movement made by the wing round a longitudinal axis, by means\r\nof which it always exposes its lower surface in front on rising, is\r\nobtained by the mechanism illustrated in fig. 478 _a_.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. TATIN’S BIRD.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, looked at sideways or from behind, is composed of a\r\nlight wooden frame, on which are two small supports crossed by an\r\naxletree so as to form two cranks. This axle receives a circular\r\nmovement from an india-rubber spring. The crank on the foremost plane\r\ncauses the rising and falling of the wings, which move round a common\r\naxis, and pass the dead points as the cranks of a locomotive do—so the\r\naction is maintained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478.—M. Tatin’s bird.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478 _a_.—Detail of fig. 478.]\r\n\r\nBut the wing does not only move as a whole; every part of it,\r\nparticularly as it rises, shows a tendency to inclination, which\r\nis most marked towards the extremity; the part near the body alone\r\npreserves an invariable obliquity. M. Tatin was of opinion that it is\r\nwith the screw that it is necessary to direct the twisting movement;\r\nand to obtain it with all its transitions, he has substituted for silk\r\nwings, which fold up, some wings composed entirely of strong feathers,\r\narranged in such a manner that they slipped one over the other when\r\nin motion. The arrangement was perfect, but still not suitable for\r\nadaptation to the large bird. The inventor therefore again returned to\r\nthe use of the silk wings, which he appears to have definitely adopted.\r\nBy means of certain modifications which he has recently introduced\r\nin his larger apparatus—viz., a change in the shape of the wings,\r\nvariation of the amplitude in the flapping, etc., M. Tatin has been\r\nenabled to make great progress. The bird, acting by means of compressed\r\nair, at first could only raise three-quarters of its own weight, but\r\nfinally lifted itself entirely. And we must take into consideration\r\nthat the apparatus has to struggle against the weight of the steering\r\napparatus, which nullifying the vertical and horizontal reactions of\r\nthe bird during flight, constantly fulfils the office of regulator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479.—Back view of apparatus.]\r\n\r\nWe will now pass to the consideration of two ingenious appliances of a\r\nvery clever inventor, M. Salleron.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL ATMOSPHERIC BOAT.\r\n\r\nThe little boat shown in fig. 480, which is about the size of\r\nan ordinary plaything, is a very ingenious, if not a practical,\r\napplication of the specific lightness of air acting as a propelling\r\nforce. In this instance steam plays but a secondary part, which\r\nconsists in carrying off the air that causes the moving of the boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480.—Atmospheric boat.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, as represented in fig. 481, is of extreme simplicity,\r\nas will be seen at a glance. A small cylindrical boiler, B, connected\r\nwith a capillary tube, is placed on two supports over a spirit-lamp,\r\nin such a manner that the opening from which the steam issues is\r\ndirectly opposite the mouth of the tube, T. This tube, after forming a\r\nsudden inclination, terminates at the back of the boat in an inclined\r\ndrain, R. The steam driven through the tube, T, carries along with it\r\na certain quantity of air, which, forced under the water, propels the\r\nboat along. The little vessel soon reaches considerable speed, leaving\r\na long track behind it. It will be seen that this is not a mechanical\r\napparatus, capable of absorbing force or diminishing the action of\r\nsteam by causing its condensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481.—Section of “atmospheric” boat.]\r\n\r\nLet us now calculate the force engendered by this apparatus. We know\r\nthat a litre of water at boiling point gives 1,700 times its volume.\r\nThe steam, as it quickly issues from the opening of the boiler,\r\ncarries along at least ten times its volume, or 17,000 litres of air,\r\nwhich, driven under the water, assumes an ascending force equal to the\r\ndifference of the densities of water and air, or about the weight of\r\nthe displaced water. Therefore in a litre of water transformed into\r\n1,700 litres of the steam, which carries off into the water 1,700 ×\r\n10 = 17,000 litres of air, a force is developed represented by 34,000\r\nkilograms. In fact, by reason of the inclined position of the drain\r\non which the pressure of air acts, and its restricted dimensions,\r\nthe quantity of force employed in the propulsion of the boat is but\r\na fraction of the total force produced. Moreover, the resistance of\r\ntraction increases with the size of the boat, and as the dimensions\r\nof the inclined pipe cannot be indefinitely enlarged, the result is\r\nthat the propulsive action is soon insufficient, so that the invention\r\nis not, in its present condition, applicable to navigation on a large\r\nscale. Its superiority to the steam-engine cannot, therefore, be\r\ndemonstrated; and we are only now discussing the contrivance in order\r\nto show that it is possible, with only moderately powerful generators\r\nand extremely simple mechanical appliances, to obtain considerable\r\ndynamic effects, susceptible of more serviceable application than is\r\ncommonly believed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULATING FOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus given in fig. 482 is the subject of a very charming\r\nexperiment, showing the influence of capillarity on the movements\r\nof liquids. Two glass balls, B B´, are connected by two tubes; one\r\nstraight and of rather large diameter, the other extremely slender,\r\nand winding in and out in a more or less complicated manner. The large\r\ntube passes into ball B´, and forms a slender point, J, at the orifice\r\nof the narrow tube. At the lower end of the ball is a bulb, which is\r\nclosed with a cork, and contains a coloured liquid. The apparatus is\r\nfixed to a board with a ring at each end, by which it can be hung on\r\nthe wall. When commencing the experiment, it should be hung so that\r\nthe ball B´ is uppermost. The liquid then flows through into the ball\r\nB, without presenting any particular phenomenon. The apparatus is then\r\nturned, and the liquid descends again with great speed, shoots through\r\nthe opening, J, and rises into the twisted tube. The air displaced from\r\nball B´ also rises, however, and mingles with the liquid, and it can be\r\nseen circulating through the winding tube in a number of air-bubbles,\r\nmingled with drops of liquid, gradually transmitting the pressure of\r\nthe column contained in the upper ball and straight tube; so that by\r\nmeans of a similar phenomenon to that of the fountain of Nero, the\r\nliquid rises higher than the level of the reservoir, a part falling\r\ninto ball B, which causes the experiment to be a little prolonged. This\r\ncirculation of air-bubbles and coloured drops through the twisted tube\r\nof the apparatus has a very pretty effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482.—Circulating fountain.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PNEUMATIC PENCIL.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious invention is productive of results similar to Edison’s\r\nelectric pen. It is the invention of an American gentleman, Mr. J.\r\nW. Brickenridge, of Lafayette, Indiana. The illustration (fig. 483)\r\nexplains the mechanism of the pneumatic pencil. The whole apparatus is\r\nfigured on the left side of the picture, while the longitudinal section\r\nof the pencil is shown on the right, the small cut at the top being\r\na vertical section of a portion of the motive power. Compressed air\r\nfurnishes the power of pressure, which is accomplished by means of a\r\nperforating needle.\r\n\r\nIf the treadle is put in motion, a backward and forward movement is\r\nimparted to a flexible diaphragm, as in the upper section in the\r\ncentre of the illustration. By this movement the air is permitted\r\nto enter, and is compressed by the diaphragm into the flexible tube\r\nwith which the diaphragm is connected. The air is thus brought into\r\ncontact with another diaphragm at the end of the tube and presses\r\non it. The pencil is fixed to the latter. When it is desired to use\r\nthe pencil the apparatus is set in motion, and by a series of sharp,\r\nquick perforations, any writing can be traced, as by the electric pen.\r\nThis indentation can be copied over and over again in a press, the\r\nwriting acting as the negative; and if ink be first run over it, as\r\nin a stencil plate, by a proper “roller,” the latter will come out as\r\nplainly as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483.—Pneumatic pencil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBE WELLS.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which the tube well depends is very simple. It is\r\nwell known that in certain localities water lies a short distance\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground, and a very little trouble would\r\nsatisfy us upon the point, and render us quite independent of the water\r\ncompanies’ supply. On the supposition that the water exists underneath\r\nour garden at, say, twenty-five feet beneath the surface of the ground,\r\nwe have only to drive into the soil a tube for that distance, and by\r\nthe assistance of a common pump we shall obtain a pure supply of water.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to describe the manner in which these wells are\r\nsunk. The first step is to fix a platform firmly upon the ground and\r\nbore a hole, by which the tube is to enter the ground. This tube\r\nshould be very thick, with an aperture of two inches or rather\r\nless, and three or four yards in length. The lower portion should be\r\npierced with holes, as in the illustration, and terminating in a point\r\nof extremely fine-tempered steel. This tube can be driven into the\r\nground by mallets, or by the suspended hammer, worked as shown in the\r\nillustration (fig. 484). This work will be easily accomplished, and\r\nwhen the first length of tube has been driven in, another can be fixed\r\nto it and hammered down in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484.—Tube Well.]\r\n\r\nWhen the tubes have been driven to the depth indicated it will be as\r\nwell to let down a sounding line, a simple cord sustaining a pebble. If\r\nthe stone be pulled up dry, another length of tube can be added, or the\r\ntubes can be pulled up, and another trial made. If, on the contrary,\r\nthe pebble come up wet, the object is accomplished, and a small pump\r\ncan be fixed to the upper end of the tube, as in fig. 485. At first\r\nthe water will be found a little thick and muddy, in consequence of\r\nthe disturbance of the soil and the particles adhering to the end of\r\nthe first tube; but after an hour or so it will be found that the\r\nwater has become quite clear. It need scarcely be said that if the\r\nwater possesses sufficient ascensional force to rise to the level of\r\nthe ground a pump need not be employed. An Artesian Well will, in that\r\ncase, be the result.\r\n\r\nThe operation described on page 456 can usually be performed without\r\nany difficulty. Sometimes, however, the tube may come in contact with a\r\nlarge stone, and in that case the experiment must be tried elsewhere;\r\nbut, as a rule, the pointed tube, in consequence of its small size\r\nand penetrative power, pushes any moderately-sized obstacle aside,\r\nreadily turns aside itself, or passes between pieces of stone to the\r\ndesired depth. Nine times out of ten the operation will be successful,\r\nand the experiment will not occupy more than an hour, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, and the tubing (and pump) may be obtained at a moderate\r\nprice, which can even be diminished by arrangement. Ordinary wells are\r\nrelatively very difficult to sink, and the soil thrown out from the pit\r\nis in the way, while a parapet is necessary to protect the opening.\r\nBesides, should water not be found after much work, the expense and\r\ntrouble of digging will be uselessly incurred. Thanks to the tube\r\nsystem, we can search or probe for water anywhere with ease, and if we\r\ndo not find it in one spot we can easily move on to another without\r\nincurring any serious trouble or expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485.—Abyssinian Pump.]\r\n\r\nWe believe the idea of these “instantaneous wells” originated in the\r\nUnited States during the War of Secession, when some soldiers of the\r\nNorthern army sunk rifle barrels into the ground, and obtained water\r\nin a barren land. To Mr. Norton the development of the idea is due,\r\nand in the Abyssinian Expedition the utility of the notion was fully\r\ndemonstrated. Since that time M. Donnet of Lyons has modified and\r\nimproved the tube-well, and arranged all the materials, including wider\r\ntubing and the hammers upon a carriage, thus giving greater facilities\r\nto the workmen and to those desirous of sinking such wells.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of M. Donnet, and the carriage with its\r\nequipments utilized, is depicted in fig. 484; the actual sinking of the\r\nwell is carried out just as originally performed by Mr. Norton.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW SWIMMING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 486.—Swimming apparatus.]\r\n\r\nWe have to mention a novel means of swimming, which may prove useful\r\nto those who distrust the natural buoyancy of water and their own\r\npowers of keeping afloat or swimming. The simple apparatus, shown in\r\nfig. 486, is the invention of an American named Richardson, a citizen\r\nof Mobile, U.S.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 487.—Nautical Velocipede.]\r\n\r\nThe machine consists, essentially, of a shaft, upon which a float is\r\nfixed, and at the end of the shaft is a small screw propeller. The\r\nshaft is put in motion by a wheel arrangement worked by the hands, and\r\nby a crank moved by the feet. The swimmer rests upon the float, with\r\nhis head well above water. The float sustains him, while the propeller\r\nforces him through the water, without his feeling fatigued, at the\r\nrate of about five miles an hour. A certain amount of practice is\r\nnecessary to obtain complete command of the machine, but when mastered\r\nthe swimmer can proceed, without much exertion, at a rapid rate. The\r\napparatus itself is not difficult to make, and persons who have tried\r\nit speak highly of its convenience and of the facilities it may afford.\r\nCaptain Boyton’s swimming-dress is another useful invention, but the\r\nmeans of mechanical propulsion are wanting, while in this new apparatus\r\nthe swimmer can drive himself through the sea with ease and expedition,\r\nand even a non-swimmer may thereby save life without danger to himself,\r\nor the person he wishes to rescue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 488.—Trained seal drawing canoe.]\r\n\r\nThe NAUTICAL VELOCIPEDE, which also deserves some notice at our\r\nhands, is the invention of M. Croce-Spinelli, who tried it upon the\r\ngreat lake of Vincennes and also on the Seine, when it was the object\r\nof much curiosity; but when the Franco-German war broke out the\r\nexperiments were discontinued, and the inventor did not live to perfect\r\nthe apparatus. He fell a victim to his love for ballooning. But M.\r\nJoberts, a practical machinist, has lately taken up the idea broached\r\nby Croce-Spinelli, and has brought out a new water velocipede of very\r\ningenious construction, with satisfactory results. The machine is\r\ndescribed as follows. There are two hollow tin “floats” of cylindrical\r\nform, and tapered at the ends. These floats are joined together by a\r\nplatform made of very light wood, on which the seat of the worker is\r\nraised, and underneath is the machinery for propelling the velocipede.\r\nThe motive power is very simple, and corresponds to that employed to\r\npropel the bicycle on land, by the feet of the rider, the wheel being\r\nfurnished with paddles in the water velocipede.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489.—Double yachts.]\r\n\r\nA rudder, which can easily be worked by cords, gives the velocipedist\r\ncomplete control of the machine, the steering being performed by a\r\nhandle similar to that which the bicyclist uses to turn the machine\r\nhe rides. In fact, the “water” velocipede is an adaptation of the\r\n“terrestrial” machine so familiar to all readers. This velocipede is\r\nequally adapted for sea or lake progression, the waves of the former\r\nbeing, under ordinary circumstances, no obstruction, for very little\r\nmotion is imparted to the sitter. For those desirous to bathe in deep\r\nwater the machine offers many facilities; and in the case of attack of\r\ncramp or faintness, rescue would not be difficult, as the swimmer could\r\nsupport himself upon the pointed cylinders of the water velocipede till\r\nassistance arrived. On the other hand, it is very necessary to know how\r\nto swim before attempting to work the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 490.—Ice boats.]\r\n\r\nBefore describing the ice-yachts which are used in Canada when winter’s\r\ncold grasp lies on water and land, we will mention a very curious\r\nexperiment in water locomotion made a year or two ago. The illustration\r\nexplains itself. It is not an imaginary sketch, it is the record of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThis sagacious seal was exhibited in London, and was in the habit of\r\nperforming certain tricks, one item of his performance being to draw\r\nthe light canoe (as represented), and another accomplishment consisted\r\nin “striking the light guitar,” to the astonishment of the spectators,\r\namongst whom was the writer. The instrument was placed between his\r\nfins, or “flappers,” and the seal twanged it more or less melodiously.\r\nHe was very tame, and obedient to his master and trainer.\r\n\r\nWe all have heard of, even if we have not seen, the twin steamer\r\n_Castalia_, which, pending the opening of the tunnel beneath the\r\nChannel, was supposed to reduce sea-sickness to a minimum. The\r\n_Castalia_ did not answer, however, but an American has planned\r\ncertain double yachts, of which we give an illustration. The\r\nsailing-boats, as represented, have had much success upon the lake of\r\nCayuga, and are quite seaworthy,—in fact, it is impossible to overturn\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe weight of one of these yachts is about fifteen hundred pounds, and\r\nthe draught six inches. Having two keels they answer the helm very\r\nreadily. The boat, in the centre of the illustration, belongs to Mr.\r\nPrentiss, and is called the _Pera Ladronia_. It is a very fast “ship.”\r\n\r\nFrom navigation in water, we now come to navigation _on_ water. The\r\nice-boats are much used in Canada, and their simple but effective\r\nconstruction will be readily perceived from the accompanying\r\nillustration. The Americans state that these ice-yachts can run before\r\na good breeze as fast as an ordinary train. There are, or were, models\r\nof some such (Finland) yachts in the South Kensington Museum with two\r\nsails. The American yacht, as a rule, has only one sail, and the owners\r\nsay—but we will not vouch for the truth of the allegation—that they\r\nfrequently run far ahead of the wind that primarily propelled them!\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILING ON LAND.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to sail upon land, although this statement may\r\nappear contradictory in terms. “The force of the wind upon sails,” says\r\nBishop Wilkins in his work, “Mathematical Magic,” printed in London in\r\n1648, “can be applied to vehicles on land as well as to ships at sea.\r\nSuch conveyances,” he adds, “have long been in use in China and in\r\nSpain, as well as in flat countries, such as Holland, where they have\r\nbeen employed with great success. In the last-named country they are\r\npropelled with greater speed than are ships before a fair wind; so that\r\nin a few hours a boat containing several persons actually travelled\r\nnearly two hundred miles, with no trouble to any one on board except\r\nthe steersman, who had little difficulty in guiding the boat.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 491.—Sailing carriage of the 17th century, from a\r\ndrawing of the period.]\r\n\r\nThe astonishment expressed by the good bishop was quite justified, for,\r\nas a matter of fact, a carriage or boat on wheels, with sails, as shown\r\nin the illustration, achieved a distance of nearly thirty-eight miles\r\nin an hour. This pace was quite unknown at that time; such a rate of\r\ntravelling had never entered the minds of people then. “Men running in\r\nfront of the machine after a while appeared to be going backwards, so\r\nquickly were they overtaken and passed.” “Objects at a distance were\r\napproached in the twinkling of an eye, and were left far in the rear.”\r\nSo it is evident that, had locomotion by steam not been adopted, the\r\nmode of sailing on land would have eventually become the most rapid\r\nmode of transit, and it is rather remarkable that it was never adopted\r\nas a mode of travel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492.—On the Kansas Pacific Railway.]\r\n\r\nBut Bishop Wilkins had not to reproach himself on this account, for he\r\nadapted the principle of the windmill to carriages, “so that the sails\r\nwould turn and move his car, no matter in what direction the wind was\r\nblowing.” He proposed to make these sails act upon the wheels of a\r\ncarriage, and trusted to “make it move in any direction, either with\r\nthe wind or against it!” This suggestion has been lately adopted in the\r\nUnited States, and it is curious that after two hundred and fifty years\r\nno better mode for utilizing wind-power on land has ever been found.\r\nPerhaps the ice-boats already mentioned may be the forerunners of some\r\nnew system of “land transport,” for which enormous kites have been made\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that if the introduction of railroads quite\r\n“took the wind out of the sails” of any other mode of locomotion\r\non _terra firma_, it is that very iron track which has led to the\r\nreintroduction of sails as a mode of progression upon the rails. In\r\nthe United States at the present time there are many vehicles propelled\r\nby sails across the immense prairies at a pace, with a strong wind,\r\nwhich equals that of the trains. We are indebted to Mr. Wood, of\r\nHayes City, Kansas, for the photograph from which the picture of the\r\nsailing-waggon, invented by Mr. Bascom, of the Kansas Pacific Railway,\r\nis copied. This carriage travels usually at thirty miles an hour, and a\r\nspeed of forty miles an hour has been obtained when the wind has been\r\nhigh and blowing directly “aft.” The distance of eighty-four miles has\r\nbeen accomplished in four hours when the wind was “on the beam,” or a\r\nlittle forward of it, and on some curves with an almost contrary breeze.\r\n\r\nThe newest machine has four wheels, each thirty inches in diameter;\r\nit is six feet in length, and weighs six hundred pounds. The sails\r\nare carried upon two masts, and they contain about eighty-one square\r\nfeet of canvas. The main, or principal mast, is eleven feet high, four\r\ninches in diameter at the base, and two inches at the top. As in the\r\ncase of the ice-boats, it is claimed for the sailing carriage that\r\nit frequently outstrips the wind that propels it along the track.\r\nOn the other hand, there is a difference between the best sailing\r\npoints of the two kinds of vehicle. The ice-boat goes quickest with\r\nthe wind “dead aft,” the carriage makes best time with the wind “on\r\nthe beam”—_i.e._, sideways. The greater friction and larger surface\r\nexposed to the influence of a side-wind no doubt will account for the\r\ndifference between the speed of the railway sailing-carriage and the\r\nice-boat.\r\n\r\nMr. Bascom informs us that the carriage we have described is in\r\nfrequent use upon the Kansas Pacific Railway, where it is employed to\r\ntransport materials for the necessary repairs of the line, telegraph,\r\netc., etc. It is a very cheap contrivance, and a great economizer of\r\nlabour. We all have noticed the cumbrous method of “trolly-kicking” by\r\n“navvies” along the line. A trolly fitted with a sail would, in many\r\ncases, and on many English lines, save a great deal of trouble, time,\r\nand exertion to the plate-layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTORY—HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY—NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493.—Celestial globe.]\r\n\r\nAstronomy is the science which treats of the heavenly bodies and the\r\nlaws which govern them. The term is derived from two Greek words,\r\n_astron_, a star, and _nomos_, a law. It may be included in the study\r\nof Physics, for the motion of the planetary bodies and equilibrium,\r\ngravity, etc., all have something to say to the arrangements and\r\npositions of the stars. The space in which they are set is infinite,\r\nand known as the “Firmament,” or “Heaven.” The number of the heavenly\r\nbodies must therefore be infinite also. We can see a few stars,\r\ncomparatively speaking, and there must be numbers whose light has never\r\nyet reached the earth. When we calmly reason upon the immeasurable\r\ndistances and the awful rapidity of motion, with the masses of matter\r\nthus in movement, we are constrained to acknowledge that all our\r\nboasted knowledge is as nothing in the wondrous dispensations of Him\r\n“who telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their\r\nnames.”\r\n\r\nAstronomy, no more than any other of the physical sciences, cannot\r\nstand by itself. We have seen how heat, light, electricity, etc., are\r\nall, in a manner, inter-dependent. So astronomy is dependent upon\r\nmathematics, particularly geometry and trigonometry, for the wondrous\r\nproblems to be solved. But in the following sketch we do not propose\r\nto plunge the reader in the slough of calculations. We only desire to\r\nput plainly before him the great phenomena of nature with regard to the\r\nheavens, and the glorious orbs which so thickly stud the space above\r\nus. We need not detail the laborious calculations by which philosophers\r\nhave arrived at certain discoveries. We may refer to the results and\r\nexplain general principles, thereby indicating the road by which the\r\nstudent may arrive at the more difficult bypaths in the fields of\r\nscientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe history of astronomy is nearly as old as the world itself, or\r\nrather as old as the human race. From the earliest ages we can picture\r\nmen gazing upon the “spangled heavens,” and the wandering tribes of the\r\ndesert were always very careful observers of the paths of the stars.\r\nTo the nomads of the East the planetary system served as compass and\r\nclock, calendar and barometer.\r\n\r\nWe shall find, therefore, that many observations of the heavenly\r\nbodies were made by the ancients, and have descended to more advanced\r\ngenerations, and this leads us to remark that the science of astronomy\r\ncan be studied without any very special or costly apparatus. In other\r\nbranches of science numerous instruments are indispensable before\r\nwe can reveal to ourselves the desired results. In astronomy, a\r\ntelescope—even a good field glass, such as possessed by any household,\r\nwill reveal many interesting facts. We will, by means of more expensive\r\ninstruments, and by the aid of large telescopes particularly, enjoy\r\nthe sight of the moon and planets. But even with the naked eye a great\r\nvariety of phenomena may be observed. With a celestial globe in our\r\nhands upon a fine starry night, we can easily find out the position of\r\nthe constellations, and trace their forms in the firmament.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Chaldeans, Indians, Chinese, and Egyptians, that our\r\nknowledge of astronomy is primarily due. They did much to facilitate\r\nthe observation of the stars; they named the planets, grouped the\r\nstars, and marked the sun’s track in the sky. _Astrology_ was\r\ncultivated in very remote ages. The Jews practised it; and the\r\nastrologers of subsequent periods played very important parts in\r\ndivining the future of individuals, and casting their _horoscopes_.\r\nMany of these so-called predictions came true, “because,” as was\r\nremarked by Pascal, “as misfortunes are common they” (the astrologers)\r\n“are often right,” as they foretold misfortune oftener than good\r\nfortune. Still the fact remains that occasionally a very startling\r\nprediction was made, and proved true; such, for instance, as the laying\r\nwaste of Germany by Gustavus Adolphus, which was foretold by Tycho\r\nBrahé after his consideration of a certain comet, and the date of the\r\nking’s death was also correctly prophesied. Astrology, therefore, held\r\na very considerable influence over the human race during the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nWe can only give a very brief historical summary of the science. We\r\nknow that the destinies of individuals and nations were at a very early\r\nperiod attributed to the influence of the stars. We read that “the\r\nstars in their courses fought against Sisera,” and many expressions\r\nsurviving to the present time serve to remind us that the stars were at\r\none time paramount in men’s minds. Thus we have the phrases—“unlucky\r\nstar,” “born under a lucky star,” “mark my stars,” “moonstruck,”\r\netc. Even the common term “consider”—to take counsel of the stars—is\r\nthus accounted for, and many men have a habit of looking up to the\r\nceiling of a room or to the sky when thinking deeply—considering\r\nwith the stars. “Contemplate” is another term signifying the same\r\nthing; for _templum_, a temple, was formerly a space marked upon\r\nthe sky in imaginary lines, and traced on the ground in accordance\r\nwith the supposed diagram. Thus temple became a place for heavenly\r\n“contemplation,” and by an easy transition to a place of worship. In\r\nour old poets’ writings we have many allusions to the influences of the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n                “Now glowed the firmament\r\n    With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led\r\n    The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,\r\n    Riding in clouded majesty, at length\r\n    Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,\r\n    And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.”—MILTON.\r\n\r\nAlthough from Thales, who lived B.C. 610, the real science of astronomy\r\nmay be allowed to date, there can be no doubt that the ancients were\r\nacquainted with many phenomena. The Chaldeans were, doubtless, the\r\nfirst to place on record the rising and setting of the celestial bodies\r\nand eclipses, and used the water-clock (clepsydra). A list of eclipses\r\nfrom 2234 B.C. is stated to have been found at Babylon by Alexander the\r\nGreat. The Chaldeans also divided the ecliptic into twelve equal parts,\r\nand the day and night into twenty-four hours. The Chinese, again, have\r\nrecorded astronomical phenomena as far back as 2857 B.C.; and the\r\nEgyptians also were well versed in the science, although no records\r\nof much importance remain to us, unless the zodiac signs were their\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nThales predicted the eclipse of the sun B.C. 610. Aristarchus and\r\nEratosthenes also made important observations. Hipparchus (160-125\r\nB.C.) discovered the precession of the equinoxes, calculated eclipses,\r\ndetermined the length of the year, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, of Alexandria, A.D. 130-150, was the founder of a theory\r\ncalled the Ptolemaic System, which recognized the earth as the centre\r\nof all—the sun, moon, stars, etc., all revolving in very complicated\r\ncourses around it, as figured in the diagram herewith. Even though his\r\ntheory turned out to be untenable, he paved the way for his successors\r\nin other ways, and left a valuable collection of observations on\r\nrecord. In this volume, called the “Almagest,” he reviewed the state of\r\nthe science, and gave a catalogue of stars, as well as a description of\r\nthe heavens. He discovered the lunar evection.\r\n\r\nAfter his time astronomy, though it was not neglected, appeared to\r\ndroop, and it is at a comparatively late period that we again open\r\nthe records—viz., in 1543, the year in which Copernicus died. This\r\nphilosopher, who was born in 1473, promulgated the true theory of the\r\nsolar system. He placed the sun in the centre of the planets, and by\r\nthis he explained their motion around the sun, though they appeared to\r\nbe carried round the earth. The book in which he explained his theory,\r\n“De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium,” was not finished till a day or\r\ntwo before he died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 494.—Ptolemaic System.]\r\n\r\nThe justly celebrated Tycho Brahé was the most important of the\r\nsuccessors of Copernicus, but he opposed the Copernican theory, while\r\nother able philosophers agreed with it. Brahé was a Dane; he died in\r\n1601. He adopted the theory that the sun and moon revolved around the\r\nearth, while the (other) planets moved around the sun. This theory\r\ndid not gain much credence, but he, again, though he could not defeat\r\nCopernicus, and though he was wrong in his assumption, made many\r\nimportant investigations. After him came Kepler, whose observations\r\nupon the planet Mars cleared away many complications, and he laid down\r\nthree laws, which are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Every planet describes an elliptic orbit about the sun, which\r\noccupies one focus of each such ellipse.\r\n\r\n2. If a line be drawn from the sun, continually, to any planet, this\r\nline will sweep over equal areas in equal times.\r\n\r\n3. The squares of the periodic times of the planets are proportional to\r\nthe cubes of their mean distances from the sun.\r\n\r\nKepler also remarked that gravity was a power existing between all\r\nbodies, and reasoned upon the tides being caused by the attraction of\r\nthe moon for the waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 495.—Copernican System.]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time—viz., the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury—that the telescope was invented, and logarithms came into\r\nuse. The actual discoverer of this now almost perfected instrument is\r\nuncertain. Borelli, who wrote in the seventeenth century, ascribes the\r\ndiscovery to Zachariah Jansen and Hans Lippersheim, spectacle makers of\r\nMiddleburg. Baptista Porta, also a spectacle maker, has had the credit\r\nof discovering the magnifying power of the lens, and, so far, the\r\noriginator of the telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 496.—Ellipse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 497.—Radii Vectores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 498.—Ecliptic and Equator.]\r\n\r\nBut whoever invented it, the telescope did not penetrate into southern\r\nEurope till 1608-9. Galileo then made inquiries concerning the new\r\ninstrument, and Kepler made some propositions for their construction.\r\nBut Harriot had used the instrument so far back as 1611 or 1612, and\r\nhad observed spots upon the sun’s disc. Galileo, in 1610, had also\r\nmade observations with the telescope, and discovered the satellites\r\nof Jupiter. He thereby confirmed the Copernican theory;[25] and when\r\nNewton promulgated his immortal discovery of gravitation, after\r\nPicard’s researches, the relations of the sun and planets became\r\nmore evident. His researches were published in the _Principia_, and\r\nthen one-half the scientific world began to question the principle\r\nof gravitation, which was supported by Newton and his adherents.\r\nSubsequently the researches of Lagrange and Laplace, Adams and\r\nLeverrier, Sir J. Herschel, etc., brought astronomy into prominence\r\nmore and more; and the innumerable stars have been indicated as new\r\nplanets have been discovered. The spectroscope, which gives us the\r\nanalyses of the sun and other heavenly bodies, has, in the able hands\r\nof living astronomers, revealed to us elements existing in the vapours\r\nand composition of the sun, etc. Stars are now known to be suns, some\r\nbearing a great resemblance to our sun, others differing materially.\r\nThe nebulæ have been analysed, and found to be stars, or gas, burning\r\nin space—hydrogen and nitrogen being the chief constituents of this\r\nglowing matter. Instruments for astronomical observation have now been\r\nbrought to a pitch of perfection scarcely ever dreamed of, and month\r\nby month discoveries are made and recorded, while calculations as to\r\ncertain combinations can be made with almost miraculous accuracy. The\r\ntransit of Venus, the approaches of comets, eclipses, and the movements\r\nof stars, are now known accurately, and commented upon long before the\r\nevent can take place.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter by giving a brief explanation of the various\r\ndefinitions most usually employed in astronomy.\r\n\r\n1. The _Axis_ of the earth is an _imaginary_ line passing through the\r\ncentre (north and south); the _poles_ are the extremities of this line.\r\n\r\n2. The _Equator_ is an imaginary circle passing round the globe,\r\ndividing it into northern and southern hemispheres. The _equinoctial_\r\nis the plane of the former circle extended to the heavens, and\r\nwhen the sun appears in that line the days and nights are of equal\r\nduration—twelve hours each.\r\n\r\n3. The _Ecliptic_ is the sun’s path through the heavens—though, of\r\ncourse, the sun does not actually move, and therefore the track, or\r\nsupposed circle, is really the earth’s motion observable from the sun.\r\nWhen the moon is near this circle eclipses happen. The ecliptic cuts\r\nthe equinoctial at an angle of about 23°. One half is to the north and\r\nthe other to the south of the equinoctial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 499.—The Zodiac.]\r\n\r\n4. The _Zodiac_ is a girdle extending 8° on each side of the ecliptic,\r\nin which space of 16° the planets move. The zodiac is divided into\r\ntwelve parts of 30° each, called the “Signs.” These names are as under\r\nwritten:—\r\n\r\nNORTHERN SIGNS.\r\n\r\n_Spring._\r\n\r\n  Aries, the Ram, March.\r\n  Taurus, the Bull, April.\r\n  Gemini, the Twins, May.\r\n\r\n_Summer._\r\n\r\n  Cancer, the Crab, June.\r\n  Leo, the Lion, July.\r\n  Virgo, the Virgin, August.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN SIGNS.\r\n\r\n_Autumn._\r\n\r\n  Libra, the Balance, September.\r\n  Scorpio, the Scorpion, October.\r\n  Sagittarius, the Archer, November.\r\n\r\n_Winter._\r\n\r\n  Capricornus, the Goat, December.\r\n  Aquarius, the Waterbearer, January.\r\n  Pisces, the Fishes, February.\r\n\r\n5. _Colures_ are two circles dividing the ecliptic into four equal\r\nparts, and making the seasons.\r\n\r\n6. The _Horizon_ is the boundary line of our vision, and is called the\r\nsensible (apparent) horizon. The true horizon is the circle—as on a\r\nglobe—dividing the heavens into two hemispheres. The sensible horizon\r\nis enlarged according as the eye is elevated above the ground. A man\r\nsix feet high can see a distance of three miles when standing on a\r\nplain. We can always find the distance visible when we know the height\r\nat which we stand, or, inversely, we can tell the height of an object\r\nif we know the distance. We have only to increase the height _one half\r\nin feet_, and extract the square root for the distance in miles. On\r\ngiving the distance in miles reverse the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 500.—Right ascension.]\r\n\r\nFor instance, for the man six feet high, as supposed, add three feet,\r\nbeing half his height; that makes nine feet. The square root (or number\r\nmultiplied by itself to give nine) is three, which is the number of\r\nmiles the man can see on a plain. Or, again, suppose we can see a\r\ntower on the level, and we know we are twelve miles away from it. The\r\nsquare of twelve is one hundred and forty-four feet, one-third of that\r\nis forty-eight feet, which represents the half of the original height\r\nadded to the whole tower in feet; so the whole tower is ninety-six feet\r\nhigh. Reversing, as in the former case, we can prove this by taking the\r\ntower at ninety-six feet high and trying to find the distance we can\r\nsee from its summit = 96 + 48 = 144; the square root of 144 = 12, the\r\ndistance required.\r\n\r\n7. The _Nadir_ and the _Zenith_ are the poles of the horizon. The\r\nzenith is exactly overhead, the nadir exactly under foot. Circles drawn\r\nthrough these points are azimuth circles.\r\n\r\n8. _Meridians_ are circles passing through the poles at right angles\r\nto the equinoctial. Every place is supposed to have a meridian, but\r\nonly twenty-four are upon the globe, and they represent the sun’s, or\r\nthe planets’, “movements” every hour—15° being one hour, 360° being\r\ntwenty-four hours (_see_ fig. 500). One quarter of a degree equals one\r\nminute of time. Parallels of latitude are familiar circles parallel to\r\nthe equator. Latitude in astronomy is the distance from the ecliptic at\r\na right angle north or south. This will be explained as we proceed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 501.—Orbit of planet.]\r\n\r\n9. _Declination_ is the distance of the heavenly bodies from the\r\nequinoctial measured as a meridian.\r\n\r\nThe _Tropics_ indicate the limits of the sun’s declination.\r\n\r\n10. _Disc_ is the term applied to the apparently flat surface of a\r\nplanet, such as the moon, for instance.\r\n\r\n11. The _Orbit_ is the path described by a planet revolving round the\r\nsun. The plane of the orbit is an imaginary surface cutting through\r\nthe centre of the sun and the planet, and extending to the stars. The\r\ndiagram shows the plane of the earth’s orbit. The circle, A B C D\r\n(fig. 501), is the ecliptic. The inclination of an orbit is the plane\r\nof the orbit with reference to the plane of the earth; and, supposing\r\nthe shaded part of the illustration to be water, a hoop held _inclined\r\ntowards the earth_, with one half in and the other half out of the\r\nwater, will describe the planetary orbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 502.—Conjunction of Venus and Saturn.]\r\n\r\n12. _Nodes_ are the opposite points of a planet where its orbit cuts\r\nthe ecliptic or the earth’s orbit.\r\n\r\n13. _Apogee_ is the point of a planet’s orbit farthest from the earth.\r\nPerigee is the nearest point.\r\n\r\n14. The terms Culmination, Conjunction, and Opposition require no\r\nspecial explanation. But planets are in conjunction with each other\r\nwhen in the same sign and degree. A planet with the sun between it and\r\nthe earth is in conjunction with the sun. With the earth between it and\r\nthe sun it is in opposition.\r\n\r\n15. Latitude and longitude upon a celestial globe are known\r\nrespectively as “Declination” and “Right Ascension.”\r\n\r\n16. The Radius Vector is a line drawn from a planet to the sun,\r\nwherever the planet may be (_see_ fig. 497).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] He was obliged to recant before the Inquisition, and to repudiate\r\nhis researches. He was released on the condition of observing silence\r\nupon the theory he had supported, but again obliged to recant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nANGLES AND MEASUREMENT OF ANGLES.\r\n\r\n THE QUADRANT—TRANSIT INSTRUMENT—CLOCKS—STELLAR TIME—SOLAR TIME—“MEAN”\r\n TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must say a few words respecting the various instruments and aids\r\nto astronomical observation before proceeding, for astronomy requires\r\nvery accurate calculations; and though we do not propose to be very\r\nscientific in our descriptions, some little idea of the manner in which\r\nobservations may be made is necessary. The first thing to see about is\r\nthe ANGLE.\r\n\r\nSuppose we draw four lines on a piece of paper, _ab_ and _cd_. These\r\nintersect at a point, _m_. We have then four spaces marked out, and\r\ncalled _angles_. The four angles are in the diagram all the same size,\r\nand are termed _right angles_, and the lines containing them are\r\nperpendicular to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 503.—Right angles.]\r\n\r\nBut by altering the position of the lines (_see_ fig. 504), we have two\r\npairs of angles quite different from right angles; one angle, _a´ m´\r\nc´_, is smaller, while _a´ m´ d´_ is much larger than the right angle.\r\nThe former kind are called _acute_, the latter _obtuse_ angles. We can\r\ntherefore obtain a great number of acute angles, but only three obtuse,\r\nand four right angles around a given point, _m_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 504.—Obtuse and acute angles.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the sides of an angle have no effect on its magnitude,\r\nwhich is determined by the inclination of the lines towards each other.\r\nWe now may consider the magnitude of angles, and the way to determine\r\nthem. For this purpose we must describe a circle, which is figured in\r\nthe diagram. But what is a circle?—A circle is a curved line which\r\nalways is at the same distance from a certain fixed point, and the ends\r\nof this line meet at the point from which the line started.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 505.—The circle, etc.]\r\n\r\nIf we fasten a nail or hold a pencil on the table, and tie a thread to\r\nit, and to the other end of the thread another pencil, we can describe\r\na line around the first pencil by keeping the thread tightly stretched.\r\nThis line is at all points at equal distance from the centre point.\r\nAny line from the centre to the circumference is called a _radius_,\r\nand a line through the centre to each side of the circumference is the\r\ndiameter, or double the radius. The circumference is three (3·14) times\r\nthe diameter. Any portion, say _k i l_, is an _arc_, and the line, _k\r\nl_, is the _chord_ of that arc. A line like _m n_ is a _secant_, and _o\r\np_ is a _tangent_, or a line touching at one point only.\r\n\r\nWe may now resume our consideration of the angles by means of the\r\ncircle. Let us recur to our previous figure of the right angles,\r\naround which we will describe a circle. We see that the portion of the\r\ncircumference contained between the sides of the right angle is exactly\r\none-fourth of the whole. This is termed a _quadrant_, and is divided\r\ninto 90°—the fourth of 360 equal parts or degrees into which the whole\r\ncircumference is divided. The angle of 45° so often quoted as an angle\r\nof inclination is half a right angle. To measure angles an instrument\r\ncalled a _Protractor_ is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 506.—Circle and angles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 507.—The Protractor.]\r\n\r\nThe Protractor, as will be seen from the accompanying illustration\r\n(fig. 507), is a semi-circle containing 180°. The lower portion is\r\na _diagonal scale_, the use of which will be explained presently.\r\nThe Protractor measures any actual angle with accuracy. If we put\r\nthe vertical point of the angle and the centre point of the circle\r\ntogether, we can arrive at the dimensions of the angle by producing the\r\nlines containing it to the circumference. An angle instrument, figured\r\nherewith, may be assumed as the basis of most apparatus for measuring\r\nangles. An index hand, R R, moves round a dial like the hand of a\r\nclock, and the instrument is used by gazing first at one of the two\r\nobjects, between which the angle we wish to determine is made—like the\r\nchurch steeples (fig. 508) for instance. The centre of the instrument\r\nis placed upon the spot where lines, if drawn from the eye to each of\r\nthe objects, would intersect. The index hand is then put at 0°, and in\r\na line between the observer and the object, A. Then the index is moved\r\ninto a similar position towards B, and when in line with it the numbers\r\nof degrees passed over (in this imaginary case 20), shows the magnitude\r\nof the angle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 508.—Determination of distance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 509.—Measuring angles.]\r\n\r\nThe simple quadrant is shown in the cut (fig. 510). This was so\r\narranged that when any object in the horizon was being looked at\r\nthrough the telescope attached, a plummet line is at 0°. But if the\r\ntelescope be raised to C S, the quadrant will move, and the line will\r\nmark a certain number of degrees of the angle which a line if drawn\r\nfrom the star makes with the line of the horizon. The “Astronomical\r\nQuadrants” are as shown in fig. 516, and consist of a quadrant of wood\r\nstrengthened and fitted with a telescope. The circle is graduated on\r\nthe outer edge, and a “vernier” is attached. The time is determined\r\nby the observation of the altitude of a star, and then by calculation\r\nfinding out at what time the star would have the observed altitude. The\r\nquadrant is now superseded by circular instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 510.—The quadrant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 511.—Ellipse.]\r\n\r\nAn ellipse is a flattened circle, or oval, and will be understood from\r\nthe diagrams. Let us fix two pegs upon a sheet of paper, and take a\r\nthread longer than the distance between the pegs; draw with the pencil\r\ncontrolled by the thread a figure, keeping the thread tight. We shall\r\nthus describe an oval, or ellipse. The orbit of nearly all the heavenly\r\nbodies is an ellipse. The _parabola_ is another curved line, but\r\nits ends never meet; they become more and more distant as they are\r\ncontinued. The comets move in parabolic curves, and consequently do not\r\nagain come within our vision unless their direction be altered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 512.—Ellipse.]\r\n\r\nThis figure has a long axis, _ab_ (fig. 512); and perpendicular to\r\nthis a short axis, _de_, passing through the centre, _c_. The two\r\npoints, SS′, are called the _foci_ of the ellipse; also, as is evident\r\nfrom the construction of the figure, any two lines drawn from the two\r\nfoci, to any point of the circumference, for instance, S and S′_m_, or\r\nS_m′_ and S′_m′_, etc., which represent the thread when the pencil is\r\nat _m_ or _m′_, are together equal to the larger axis of the ellipse.\r\nThese lines, and we may imagine an infinite number of such, are called\r\n_radii vectores_. The distance of the foci, S or S′, from the centre,\r\n_c_, is called the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse. It is evident that\r\nthe smaller the eccentricity is, the nearer the figure approaches\r\nto that of the circle. The superficies of the ellipse is found by\r\nmultiplying the two half axes, _ac_ and _dc_, by each other, and this\r\nproduct by the number 3·14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 513.—Diagonal scale.]\r\n\r\nThe _Diagonal Scale_ is shown in the margin. It is used to make\r\ndiagrams so as to bring the relative distances before the eye. The\r\nlarger divisions represent, it may be, miles, or any given distance;\r\nthe figures on the left side tenths, and the upper range hundredths of\r\na mile. So a measurement from Z to Z′ will represent two miles, we may\r\nsay, with so many tenths and hundredths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 514.—Transit instrument.]\r\n\r\nThe Transit instrument is due to Roemer, a Danish astronomer. It\r\nconsists of a telescope so constructed as always to point to the\r\nmeridian, and rotates upon a hollow axis, directed east and west. At\r\none end is a graduated circle. The optical axis of the telescope must\r\nbe at exactly right angles to the axis of the instrument; it will then\r\nmove on the meridian. There is an eye-piece filled with two horizontal\r\nand five vertical wires, very fine, the latter at equal distances\r\napart. The star appears, and the time it takes to cross is noted as it\r\npasses between each wire, and the mean of all the transits will be the\r\ntransit on the meridian. For if we add the times of all the transits\r\nacross the wires, and divide by five the number of them we shall get at\r\na true result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 515.—The eyepiece of transit instrument.]\r\n\r\nA good clock is also a necessary adjunct for astronomical observations,\r\nand the astronomical clocks and chronometers now in use record the time\r\nwith almost perfect accuracy. The improvement in telescopes, the use\r\nof micrometers, etc., have greatly facilitated observations. In the\r\ntransit clock we have a most useful timekeeper, for the ordinary clocks\r\nare not sufficiently accurate for very close observations. The sidereal\r\ntime differs from solar time, and the twenty-four hours’ period is\r\ncalculated from the moment a star passes the meridian until it passes\r\nit again. The sidereal day is nearly four minutes shorter than the\r\nsolar day, and the sidereal clock marks twenty-four hours instead of\r\ntwelve, like the old dial at Hampton Court Palace over the inner gate.\r\nThe Chronograph has also been useful to astronomers, for by “pricking\r\noff” the seconds on a roller by itself, the observer can mark on the\r\nsame cylinder the actual moment of transit across each wire of the\r\ninstrument, and on inspection the exact moment of transit may be noted.\r\n\r\nThe _Equitorial_ is another useful instrument, and by its means the\r\nwhole progress of a star can be traced. The Equitorial consists of a\r\ntelescope fixed so that when it has been pointed at a certain star a\r\nclock-work movement can be set in motion, which exactly corresponds\r\nwith the motion of the star across the heavens, and so while the\r\nstar moves from its rising to setting it is under observation. Thus\r\ncontinuous observations maybe made of that particular star or comet\r\nwithout any jerking or irregular movement.\r\n\r\nWe can thus see the uniform motion of the stars which go on in greater\r\nor lesser circles as they are nearer to or farther from the pole;\r\nand with the exception of the polar star, which, so far as we are\r\nconcerned, may be considered stationary, every star moves round from\r\neast to west—that is, from the east of the polar star to the west of\r\nit, in an oblique direction. Therefore, as Professor Airy remarks,\r\n“Either the heavens are solid, and go all of a piece, or the heavens\r\nmay be assumed to be fixed or immovable, and that we and the earth are\r\nturning instead of them.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 516.—Astronomical quadrant.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mural Circle_ is another very useful instrument, and is used by\r\ncalling to aid the powers of reflection of quicksilver, in which a\r\nbright star will appear below the horizon at the same angle as the real\r\nstar above the horizon, and thus the angular distance from the pole or\r\nthe horizon of any star can be calculated when we know the inclination\r\nof the telescope. The Transit Circle is also used for this purpose,\r\nand is a combination of the transit instrument with the circle. In all\r\ncalculations allowance must be made for refraction, for which a “Table\r\nof Refractions” has been compiled. From the zenith to the horizon\r\nrefraction increases. The effect of refraction can be imagined, for\r\nwhen we see the sun apparently _touching_ the horizon the orb is really\r\nbelow it, for the refraction of the rays by the air apparently raises\r\nthe disc.\r\n\r\nThe clock and chronometer are both very useful as well as very common\r\nobjects, but a brief description of the pendulum and the clock may\r\nfitly close our remarks upon astronomical apparatus and instruments.\r\nThe telescope has been already described in a previous portion of this\r\nwork, so no more than a passing reference to it has been considered\r\nnecessary. We therefore pass on to a consideration of the measurement\r\nof time, so important to all astronomers and to the public generally.\r\n\r\nTime was measured by the ancients by dividing the day and night into\r\ntwelve hours each, then by sun-dials and water-clocks, or _clepsydra_,\r\nand sand-clocks. The stars were the timekeepers for night before any\r\nmechanical means of measurement were invented.\r\n\r\n    “What is the star now passing?—\r\n    The Pleiades show themselves in the east,\r\n    The eagle is soaring in the summit of heaven.”—EURIPIDES.\r\n\r\nSun-dials were in use in Elijah’s time, and the reference to the\r\nmiracle of the sun’s shadow going back on the dial as a guarantee\r\nto Hezekiah, will be recalled at once by our readers. These dials\r\nwere universal, and till sunset answered the purpose. But the hours\r\nmust have been very varying, and on cloudy days the sun-dials were\r\npractically useless.\r\n\r\nThe water-clocks measured time by the dripping or flow of water, and\r\nthey were used to determine the duration of speeches, for orators were\r\neach allotted a certain time if a number of debaters were present.\r\nThis method might perhaps be adapted to the House of Commons, and\r\nspeaking by the clock might supersede _clôture_. We find allusions to\r\nthese practices in the orations of Demosthenes. Even this system was\r\nopen to objection, for the vases were frequently tampered with, and\r\nan illiberal or objectionable person was mulcted of a portion of the\r\nwater, while a generous or popular adversary had his clepsydra brimming\r\nfull. Some of these water-clocks were of elegant design, and a Cupid\r\nmarked the time with arrows on the column of the clock of Ctesibius,\r\nwhile another weeping kept up the supply of water. The motive power was\r\nthe water, which filled a wheel-trough in a certain time, and when full\r\nthis trough turned over, and another was filled. The wheel revolved\r\nonce in six days; and by a series of pinions and wheels the movements\r\nwere communicated more slowly to the pillar on which the time was\r\nmarked for 360 days, or with other arrangements for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe repeating of psalms by monks also marked the time, for by practice\r\na monk could tell pretty accurately how many paternosters or other\r\nprayer he could repeat in sixty seconds. At the appointed hour he then\r\nawoke the monastery to matins.\r\n\r\nNature also marks time for us—as, for example, the age of trees by\r\nmeans of rings—one for each year; and horses’ teeth will guide the\r\ninitiated to a guess at the ages of the animals, while the horns of\r\ndeer or cattle serve a like purpose. But man required accuracy and\r\nminute divisions of time. He had recourse therefore, to machinery and\r\ntoothed wheels. Till the mechanical measurement of time was adopted,\r\nthe sunrise and sunset only marked the day, and the Italians as well\r\nas Jews counted twenty-four hours from sunset to sunset. This was a\r\nmanifestly irregular method. To this day we have marked differences of\r\ntime in various places, and at Geneva we have Swiss and French clocks\r\nkeeping different hours according to Paris or Berne “time.” This, of\r\ncourse, is easily accounted for, and will be referred to subsequently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 517.—Clock movement.]\r\n\r\nWe have read that the first clock in England was put up in Old Palace\r\nyard in 1288, and the first application of the toothed-wheel clock to\r\nastronomical purposes was in 1484, by Waltherus, of Nuremberg. Tycho\r\nBrahé had a clock which marked the minutes and seconds. If we had had\r\nany force independent of gravitation which would act with perfect\r\nuniformity, so that it would measure an equal distance in equal spaces\r\nof time, all the various appliances for chronometers would have been\r\nrendered useless. In the supposed case the simple mechanism, as shown\r\nin the margin (fig. 517), would have sufficed. The same effect would\r\nbe produced by the spring, were it possible that the spring by itself\r\nwould always uncoil with the same force. But it will not do so: we\r\ntherefore have to check the unwinding of the cord and weight, for left\r\nto itself it would rapidly increase in velocity; and if we likewise\r\nmake an arrangement of wheels whereby the spring shall uncoil with even\r\npressure all the time, we shall have the principle of the watch.\r\n\r\nIt is to Huygens that the employment of the pendulum in clocks is due,\r\nand the escapement action subsequently rendered the pendulum available\r\nin simple clocks, while the manner of making pendulums self-regulating\r\nby using different metals, has rendered timepieces very exact. Of\r\ncourse the length of a pendulum determines the movement, fast or slow;\r\na long pendulum will cause the hands of the clock to go slower, for the\r\nswing will be a fraction longer. A common pendulum with the escapement\r\nis shown (fig. 518). Each movement liberates a tooth of the escapement.\r\nThe arrangement of wheels sets the clock going. The forms of pendulum\r\nare now very varied.\r\n\r\nBut in watches the pendulum cannot be used. The watch was invented by\r\nPeter Hele, and his watches were called “Nuremburg eggs” from their\r\nshape. The weight cannot be introduced into a watch, and so the spring\r\nand _fusee_ are used. The latter is so arranged that immediately the\r\nwatch is wound and the spring at its greatest tension, the chain is\r\nupon the smallest diameter of the fusee, and the most difficult to\r\nmove. But as the spring is relaxed the lever arm becomes longer,\r\nand the necessary compensating power is retained. Watches without a\r\n“_fusee_” have a toothed arrangement beneath the spring.\r\n\r\nThe _Pendulum_. A “simple” pendulum is impossible to make, for we\r\ncannot put the connecting line between the “bob” and the clock-work\r\nout of consideration, so “simple pendulums” are looked upon as\r\n“mathematical abstractions.” The most modern clocks have what is called\r\na “deadbeat” escapement, and a compensating pendulum. Clocks are liable\r\nto alter by reason of the state of the air and varying temperature,\r\nand until all our clocks are placed _in vacuo_ we must be content to\r\nhave them lose or gain a little. There is a magnet arrangement by\r\nwhich the Greenwich Observatory clocks keep time by compensation,\r\ncorresponding with the fall or rise of the syphon barometer attached\r\nto it. The description need not be added. We may here state that\r\ndetailed descriptions of all the instruments used in the Observatory,\r\ntogether with full information as to their use, will be found in a very\r\ninteresting work by Mr. Lockyer, entitled “Stargazing,” to which we are\r\nindebted for some corrections in our summary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 518.—Pendulum and escapement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 519.—Balance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 520—Regulator.]\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of solar time and sidereal time, and no doubt someone\r\nwill inquire what is meant by mean time—an expression so constantly\r\napplied to the Greenwich clock time. Stellar time, we have seen,\r\ncorresponds to the daily revolution of a star or stars. Solar time\r\nis regulated by the sun, and this is the astronomical time generally\r\nobserved, except for sidereal investigations. But the sun is not always\r\nregular; the orbit of the earth causes this irregularity partly. The\r\nearth moves faster in winter than in summer, so the sun is sometimes a\r\nlittle fast and sometimes a little slow. Astronomers therefore strike\r\nan average, and calculate upon a MEAN SUN, or uniform timekeeper. Mean\r\ntime and true (apparent) time are at some periods the same—viz., on\r\nthe 15th of April, on the 14th of June, on the 31st of August, and on\r\nthe 24th of December. Twice it is after, and twice before it. The time\r\noccupied by this “mean” sun passing from the meridian and its return to\r\nit, is a mean solar day, and clocks and chronometers are adjusted by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 521.—Fusee and spring.]\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours represents a complete revolution of the heavenly\r\nbodies. The mean solar time is 23^h 56´ 4·091´´, while twenty-four\r\nhours of mean time are equal to 24^h 3´ 56·55´´ of sidereal time. The\r\ndifference between the times is given by Dr. Newcomb as follows, and is\r\ncalled the _Equation of Time_:—\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEAN AND APPARENT TIME.\r\n\r\n  February 10th       True Sun 15 minutes slow.\r\n  April 15th              “    Correct.\r\n  May 14th                “    4 minutes fast.\r\n  June 14th               “    Correct.\r\n  July 25th               “    6 minutes slow.\r\n  August 31st             “    Correct.\r\n  November 2nd            “    16 minutes fast.\r\n  December 24th           “    Correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to consider the planetary system we must say a few words\r\nrespecting the manner of ascertaining the distances of inaccessible\r\nobjects, and by so doing, we shall arrive at an idea how the immense\r\ndistances between the sun (and the planets) and the earth have been so\r\naccurately arrived at. To do this we must speak of _parallax_, a very\r\nunmeaning word to the general reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 522.—Works of a clock.]\r\n\r\nParallax is simply the difference between the directions of an object\r\nwhen seen from two different positions. Now we can illustrate this by a\r\nvery simple method, which we have often tried as a “trick,” but which\r\nhas been very happily used by Professor Airy to illustrate the doctrine\r\nof parallax. We give the extract in his own words:—\r\n\r\n“If you place your head in a corner of a room, or on a high-backed\r\nchair, and if you close one eye and allow another person to put a\r\nlighted candle upon a table, and if you then try to snuff the candle\r\nwith one eye shut, you will find you cannot do it.... You will hold\r\nthe snuffers too near or too distant—you cannot form any idea of the\r\ndistance. But if you open the other eye, or if you move your head\r\nsensibly you are enabled to judge of the distance.” The difference of\r\ndirection between the eyes, which is so well known to all, is ready a\r\nparallax. It can also be illustrated by the diagram herewith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 523.—Parallax.]\r\n\r\nIf two persons, A and C (fig. 523), from different stations, observe\r\nthe same point, M, the visual lines naturally meet in the point, M, and\r\nform an angle, which is called the angle of _parallax_. If the eye were\r\nat M, this angle would be the angle of vision, or the angle under which\r\nthe base line, A C, of the two observers appears to the eye. The angle\r\nat M also expresses the apparent magnitude of A C when viewed from M,\r\nand this apparent magnitude is called the _parallax_ of M.\r\n\r\nLet M represent the moon, C the centre of the earth represented by the\r\ncircle, then A C is the parallax of the moon; that is, the apparent\r\nmagnitude the semi-diameter of the earth would have if seen from the\r\nmoon. If the moon be observed at the same time from A, being then on\r\nthe horizon, and from the point B, being then in the zenith, and the\r\nvisual line of which when extended passes through the centre of the\r\nearth, we obtain, by uniting the points, A C M, by lines, the triangle,\r\nA C M.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as A M, the tangent of the circle stands at right angles to\r\nthe radius, A C, the angle at A is a right angle, and the magnitude of\r\nthe angle at C is found by means of the arc, A B, the distance of the\r\ntwo observers from each other. As soon, however, as we are acquainted\r\nwith the magnitude of two angles of a triangle, we arrive at that of\r\nthe third, because we know that all the angles of a triangle together\r\nequal two right angles (180°). The angle at M, generally called the\r\nmoon’s parallax, is thus found to be fifty-six minutes and fifty-eight\r\nseconds. We know that in the right-angled triangle M C A, the measure\r\nof the angle, M = 56´ 58´´, and also that A C, the semi-diameter of\r\nthe earth = 3,964 miles. This is sufficient, in order by trigonometry,\r\nto obtain the length of the side, M C; that is, to find the moon’s\r\ndistance from the earth. A C is the sine of the angle, M, and by the\r\ntable the sine of an angle of 56´ 58´´ is equal to 1652/100000; or, in\r\nother words, if we divide the constant, M C, the distance of the moon,\r\ninto 100,000 equal parts, the sine, A C, the earth’s semi-diameter =\r\n1,652 of these parts. And this last quantity being contained 60 times\r\nin 100,000, the distance of the moon from the earth is equal to 60\r\nsemi-diameters of the earth, or 60 × 3964 = 237,840 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 524.—Parallax explained.]\r\n\r\nIn a similar way the parallax of the sun has been found = 8´´·6, and\r\nthe distance of the sun from the earth to be 91,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nLet us first see how we can obtain the distance of any inaccessible\r\nor distant object. We have already mentioned an experiment, but this\r\nmethod is by a calculation of angles. The three angles of a triangle,\r\nwe know, are equal to two right angles; that is an axiom which cannot\r\nbe explained away. We first establish a base line; that is, we plant a\r\npole at one point, A, and take up our position at another point, B,\r\nat some distance in a straight line, and measure that distance very\r\ncarefully. By means of the theodolite we can calculate the angles which\r\nour eye, or a supposed line drawn from our eye to the top of the object\r\n(C) we wish to find the distance of, makes with that object. We now\r\nhave an imaginary triangle with the length of one side, A B, known, and\r\nall the angles known; for if all three angles are equal to 180°, and we\r\nhave calculated the angles at the base, we can easily find the other.\r\nWe can then complete our triangle on paper to scale, and find out the\r\nlength of the side of the triangle by measurement; that is the distance\r\nbetween our first position, A, and the object, C. It is of course\r\nnecessary that all measurements should be _exact_, and the line we\r\nadopt for a base should bear some relative proportion to the distance\r\nat which we may guess the object to be.\r\n\r\nIn celestial measurements two observers go to different points of\r\nthe earth, and their distance in a straight line is known, and the\r\ndifference of the latitudes. By calling the line between the observers\r\na base line, a figure may be constructed and angles measured; then\r\nby some abstruse calculation the distance between the centre of the\r\nearth and the centre of the moon may be ascertained. The mean distance\r\nis sixty times the radius of the earth. The measurement of the sun’s\r\ndistance is calculated by the observations of the transit of Venus\r\nacross his disc, a phenomenon which will again occur on 6th December,\r\n1882, and on 8th June, 2004, the next transit will take place; there\r\nwill be no others for a long time after 2004.\r\n\r\nAll astronomical observations are referred to the centre of the earth,\r\nbut of course can only be viewed from the surface, and correction\r\nis made. In the cut above, let E be the earth and B a point on the\r\nsurface. From B the stars, _a_ _b_ _c_ _d_, will be seen in the\r\ndirection of the dotted lines, and be projected to _e_ _i_ _k_ _l_\r\nrespectively. But from the centre of the earth they would appear at\r\n_e_ _f_ _g_ _h_ correctly. The angles formed by the lines at _b_ _c_\r\n_d_ are the parallactic angles, _f_ _i_ _g_ _h_ and _h_ _l_ show the\r\nparallax. An object on the zenith thus has no parallax. (_See_ fig.\r\n524.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 525.—Halo Nebulæ.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n GRAVITATION—THE PLANETS—SIZE AND MEASUREMENT OF THE\r\n PLANETS—SATELLITES—FALLING STARS—COMETS—AEROLITES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 526.—Planets compared with a quarter of the sun.]\r\n\r\nGRAVITATION is the force which keeps the planets in their orbits, and\r\nthis theory, perfected by Newton, was partially known to Kepler. Newton\r\nbrought this idea into practical shape, and applied it mathematically.\r\nWe know that every object in the world tends to attract every other\r\nobject in proportion to the quantity of matter of which each consists.\r\nSo the sun attracts the planets, and they influence him in a minor\r\ndegree. Likewise the moon and our earth reciprocally attract each\r\nother. But as the sun’s mass is far greater than the masses of the\r\nplanets he influences them more, and could absorb them all without\r\ninconvenience or disturbance from his centre of gravity. We have,\r\nin a former portion of this work, spoken of the law of universal\r\ngravitation, which is the mutual attraction of any two bodies to each\r\nother, is directly proportioned to their _masses_ (not size), and\r\ninversely to the square of their distances apart.\r\n\r\nThis law operates amongst the heavenly bodies, and it is to the\r\nnever-changing action of gravitation that the planets are kept in\r\ntheir places. Let us see how this is effected. We have read of force,\r\nand motion, and rest. Every body will remain at rest unless force\r\ncompels it to change its position, and it will then go on for ever in\r\na straight path unless something stops it. But if this body be acted\r\non simultaneously by two forces in different directions, it will go in\r\nthe direction of the greater force. Two equal forces will tend to give\r\nit an intermediate direction, and an equal opposing force will stop\r\nit. The last axiom but one—viz., the two equal forces in different,\r\nnot opposing directions, gives us the key to the curving line of the\r\nplanetary motions. Were it not for the attraction of the sun the\r\nplanets would fly off at a tangent; while, on the other hand, were not\r\nthe impelling force as great as it is, they would fall into the sun.\r\nThus they take an intermediate line, and circle round the centre of the\r\nsolar system—the SUN.\r\n\r\nThe solar system consists of the sun and the planets which revolve in\r\nspace around him. These stars are called planets because they move\r\nin the heavens. We shall see that they have certain motions—going\r\nfrom east to west, from west to east, and sometimes they appear to be\r\nquite motionless. This change of place, appearing now at one side of\r\nthe sun and now at another, has given them their title of “wanderers”\r\n(planets). Besides the planets there are comets and meteors, asteroids\r\nand satellites, all circling round the sun in more or less regular\r\norbits. And there must be families of comets, and whole systems of\r\nmeteors that have not yet appeared to us, and which make up the comets,\r\nas has been lately suggested.\r\n\r\nFive planets were known to the ancients, and were named after gods and\r\na goddess: MERCURY, VENUS, MARS, JUPITER, SATURN. In later years a\r\ngreat number were discovered. We must, however, confine ourselves to\r\nthe consideration of the principal ones, eight in number, including\r\nour own EARTH, URANUS and NEPTUNE completing the list. Of these VENUS\r\nand MERCURY are the inferior, or interior planets moving between us\r\nand the sun. MARS, JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, and NEPTUNE are superior,\r\nor exterior, and pass quite round the heavens. All the planets are\r\nspheroids, and vary greatly in their magnitude, as will be seen by the\r\nillustration (fig. 528), the largest body being the sun. Mercury, Mars,\r\nand Venus, are not so large as the Earth. The other principal planets\r\nare considerably larger than our globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 527.—The Moon.]\r\n\r\nMercury is the smallest of the planets, Venus being nearly as large\r\nas the earth. Then comes Mars, which, though smaller than Venus, is\r\nlarger than Mercury. Jupiter is the largest of all—the giant amongst\r\nplanets, as Jove was the ruler of the gods of mythology. Saturn comes\r\nnext, though much smaller than Jupiter, but bigger than all the rest\r\ntogether. Next Uranus, then Neptune, larger than Uranus, but farther\r\naway from us. We shall speak more in detail about these in their order\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 528.—Comparative size of the sun seen from the\r\nplanets.]\r\n\r\nTaking the earth as 1, the comparative VOLUMES of the planets are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nMercury 1/25, Venus 4/5, Mars 1/5, Jupiter 1300, Saturn 900, Uranus\r\n80, Neptune 230. Sir John Herschel gives the following illustration of\r\nmagnitudes and distances:—\r\n\r\n“Choose any well-levelled field or bowling green; on it place a globe\r\ntwo feet in diameter; this will represent the sun. Mercury will be\r\nrepresented by a grain of mustard seed on the circumference of a\r\ncircle 164 feet in diameter for its orbit; Venus a pea, on a circle\r\n284 feet in diameter; the Earth also a pea on a circle 430 feet; Mars\r\na rather large pin’s head on a circle of 654 feet; Juno, Ceres, Vesta,\r\nand Pallas grains of sand in orbits of 1,000 to 1,200 feet; Jupiter a\r\nmoderate-sized orange on a circle nearly half a mile across; Saturn a\r\nsmall orange on a circle four-fifths of a mile; and Uranus a full-sized\r\ncherry, or small plum, upon the circumference of a circle more than a\r\nmile and a half in diameter”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 529.—Sizes of the planets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 530.—Sizes of planets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 531.—Orbits of planets.]\r\n\r\nFrom an inspection of the following table the relative distances of the\r\nprincipal planets from the sun, their diameters, and other information\r\nrespecting them may approximately be obtained.

They\r\nhave nearly all classical names, such as Juno, Ceres, Vesta, Flora,\r\nAriadne, Pallas, Pomona, Thalia, etc., and are all at distances from\r\nthe sun ranging between 200,000,000 and 300,000,000 of miles, the\r\nperiods of sidereal revolution ranging from 1,100 to 3,000 days, so\r\ntheir years must be from four times to nine times as long as ours.\r\nAltogether about two hundred of the minor planets have been discovered,\r\nand they are all very much smaller than the earth; some, indeed, being\r\nvery tiny—only a few miles in diameter, but very massive. They do not\r\nappear to possess any satellites—at least, none have been discovered,\r\nfor such very small bodies as they must be, supposing they exist, would\r\nbe quite invisible even with our perfected instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 532.—Mars.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSATELLITES, however, or “planetary moons,” as they are sometimes\r\ndesignated, are plainly perceived attending upon the great planets.\r\nThere are twenty of these at present under observation. One we are all\r\nfamiliar with, and the moon, _par excellence_, lends a beauty to our\r\nnights which no other light that we can enjoy or command can ever\r\ndo. It is remarkable that only this moon is specially mentioned in\r\nthe Bible in connection with the sun. The stars are usually grouped,\r\nalthough, of course, the sun and moon are equally “stars” in the\r\nfirmament. Mars possesses two moons and Jupiter four; Uranus also\r\nrejoices in the latter number; Neptune, like the Earth, has only one.\r\nIt is reserved for Saturn to outstrip all the rest in his attendants,\r\nfor no less than eight satellites wait upon that enormous planet. No\r\ndoubt there are many more of these moons to be found, and every year\r\nwill doubtless bring us further knowledge respecting them. Mars’ moons\r\nwere only discovered very lately (in 1877), although they were known\r\nto exist; but being very small, unlike the others, they were missed.\r\nSo we may conclude that the remaining satellites will remain for some\r\ntime undiscovered, even if they actually are in existence. Jupiter’s\r\nmoons are supposed to be as large as our own moon; Neptune and Uranus\r\ncan boast of equally-sized attendants. But it is impossible to estimate\r\nthe riches of astronomical lore which are beyond our ken. Millions of\r\ntiny planets are believed to exist, but their immense distance from us\r\nprecludes all investigation. We are but mites in the scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 533.—Jupiter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 534.—Saturn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 535.—Meteor shower.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORS, to which we have already referred, are small erratic bodies\r\nrushing through the planetary system, and getting hot in the process,\r\nappear in the atmosphere surrounding our earth as “shooting stars.”\r\nSome of these falling bodies have reached the earth, and several can\r\nbe seen in the British Museum. Numbers, of course, are burnt up before\r\nthey reach us, and who can tell what destruction such a catastrophe\r\nmay represent, or whether it be or be not an inhabited world which has\r\nthus plunged to destruction by fire? They are of a metallic or stony\r\nnature. On certain nights in August and November it has been calculated\r\nthat these meteors will appear. They fall from certain constellations\r\napparently on these occasions, and are called after their names—as\r\nLeonides, from Leo, in the November displays.\r\n\r\nThe star-showers at times attain the dimensions of a very beautiful\r\ndisplay of rockets. Millions of them rush round the sun; and when, as\r\noccasionally happens, our earth comes near them, we have (as in 1866) a\r\ngrand display of celestial “fireworks.” But the individuals composing\r\nthe mass of falling stars are very small. These meteors are very much\r\nlike the comets we last year had an example of, and it has been lately\r\nsuggested that there is a great degree of affinity between the comets\r\nand the meteors;—in fact, that a comet is merely an aggregation of\r\nmeteors. They have been supposed to be bodies of burning gas. Their\r\nmass is very great, and their brilliant tails are many millions of\r\nmiles in extent.\r\n\r\nComets are thus distinguished by their tails, and differ very much\r\nin their orbits from the planets. The latter are direct in their\r\nwanderings, but comets are most irregular and eccentric. The name\r\nbestowed upon comets is from the Greek _Kome_, hair; for when the comet\r\nrecedes from the sun the “tail” may be said to come out of the head,\r\nand appear as a hair in front, so to speak. But though all comets have\r\ntails, there are many luminous bodies (classed with comets) which have\r\nno tails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 536.—Star shower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 537.—Halley’s Comet.]\r\n\r\nThe comet which created the most excitement was Halley’s in 1456, of\r\nwhich we append an illustration (fig. 537). A comet had been observed\r\nin 1607, and Halley made a calculation that it would reappear in 1757.\r\nThe calculation for its actual appearance was made by Claivant, and\r\nthe expected visitor passed the perihelion in March 1759. This comet,\r\non its appearance at Constantinople, is said to have caused much\r\nconsternation, and Christians regarded it as a “sign,” for the Turks\r\nhad just then captured Constantinople, and were threatening Europe.\r\nPious people included it in their supplications for deliverance from\r\ntheir most dreaded enemies, and “Lord, save us from the Turks, the\r\ndevil, and the comet,” was a common prayer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 538.—Great comet of 1811.]\r\n\r\nThere have been several very beautiful comets. Encke’s, Coggia’s,\r\netc., and the comet of 1858 (Donatis) must be in the recollection of\r\nmiddle-aged readers. Others came in 1861 and 1874. In 1881 two comets\r\nappeared. Some comets of antiquity were very remarkable, and are\r\nreputed to have equalled the sun in magnitude. One tail is usually\r\nsupposed to be the distinguishing mark of a comet, but in 1774 one\r\nappeared with six tails, arranged something like a fan. Sometimes the\r\ntail is separated from the head. Of the actual consistency of comets we\r\ncannot give any lengthened details. They apparently consist of elements\r\nsimilar to the meteors—namely, of solid masses, and have been supposed\r\nto be aggregations of meteors. Some appear at regular intervals, and\r\ntheir approach can be determined with accuracy. Of course we only see\r\nthose which are attracted by the sun, or those which revolve in the\r\nsolar system. There must be thousands of other comets which we never\r\nsee at all.\r\n\r\nThe diagram (fig. 540 in the next page) represents a portion of the\r\npath of the comet of 1680. This visitor pursued its course for two\r\nmonths at a velocity of 800,000 miles an hour. The tail was estimated\r\nto extend 123,000,000 of miles, and a length of 60,000,000 of miles was\r\nemitted in two days. When this great comet was approaching the sun, or\r\nits perihelion, as such approach is termed, three minutes more would\r\nhave seen it rush into the orb had its enormous pace been slackened,\r\nbut as it was proceeding so rapidly, and being just then 144,000\r\nmiles away, it escaped. We can scarcely estimate the results of such\r\na collision. This comet appeared B.C. 34, and again at intervals of\r\nabout 575 years. It may be expected in 2255. It is to Halley that the\r\ndiscovery of the elliptical orbits of comets is due.\r\n\r\nM. Biela’s comet was the cause of much anxiety in 1832, for a collision\r\nwith the earth was apprehended. Fortunately a month intervened between\r\nthe period at which the comet was expected at a certain place in the\r\nsystem and the earth’s arrival at that spot, so, as it happened, about\r\n60,000,000 of miles intervened. We cannot say what the exact effect of\r\nsuch a collision would be, but some wonderful atmospheric phenomena and\r\nincreased temperature would certainly result from the contact. Now the\r\ncomet is supposed to have an effect upon the vintage, as “comet” wines\r\nare regarded with much favour. If comets, as is believed, do consist\r\npartly of solid particles, a collision might be unpleasant; but the\r\nweight is, as a rule, a mere nothing compared to their vapoury volume,\r\nwhich is enormous. That the tails must be of a very attenuated medium\r\nis evident, as we can see the stars through them, and we know that a\r\nvery thin cloud will obscure a star. The “menacing” comet, mentioned in\r\nthe _Spectator_ February 1881, will not do much damage, so the scare\r\nwas needless, as Mr. Proctor has explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 539.—Path of Biela’s Comet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 540.—Path of comet, 1680.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAEROLITES, or “Meteorites,” are falling bodies (meteors), which reach\r\nthe earth in solid form. The greater mass of falling stars are burnt up\r\nere they reach us, or are dissipated in space. But many instances of\r\naerolites descending might be adduced. They usually consist of metals,\r\nsuch as iron and nickel mixed with sulphur, magnesia, and silica. The\r\ntheory concerning falling stars has been already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 541.—The heavens as seen from Saturn.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus far taken a brief general view of the solar system, with a\r\nfew of the phenomena of the heavens. Our next step will be to consider\r\nthe sun, the planets, and the asteroids, according to the order of\r\nmagnitude. The asteroids we cannot consider separately, but the sun,\r\nmoon, earth, and the principal planets will yield us much interesting\r\ninformation as we examine them more closely. We shall then, as far as\r\npossible, look into the domain of the fixed stars, constellations, and\r\nthe nebulæ, commenting, as we proceed, upon the varied celestial and\r\nterrestrial phenomena connected with the movements of the heavenly\r\nbodies. As is due to the great centre of our system, we will commence\r\nwith the SUN. But before proceeding to do so, we must say a few words\r\nabout the motion of the heavenly bodies—that is, the _apparent_ motion\r\nof the rising and setting of the sun and stars.\r\n\r\nThe attentive observation of the starry heavens, even during a single\r\nnight, will convince us that all the visible stars describe circles\r\nwhich are the smaller, the nearer the stars are to a certain point of\r\nthe heavens, P (fig. 542). In close proximity to this point there is a\r\ntolerably bright star, called the _Pole Star_, which has scarcely any\r\nmotion, but appears to the eye as always occupying the same position.\r\nHence a line, PP´, drawn from this star, through the centre of the\r\nearth, _c_, represents the axis around which all the heavenly bodies\r\nperform their apparent motions. The part of the celestial axis, PP´,\r\npassing through the earth, is the earth’s axis; the north pole, of\r\nwhich _p_ is on the same side as the pole star, and the south pole,\r\n_p´_, is on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 542.—Celestial axis.]\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, by the aid of the stars, determined the position\r\nof the earth’s axis, and by this latter we can assign to the equator\r\nits proper place. For if _pp´_ be the earth’s axis, _aq´_ is the\r\ngreatest circle drawn round the earth, equally distant from both poles,\r\nand the plane of which cuts the earth’s axis at right angles.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, let us suppose the plane of the equator to be extended\r\ntill it reach the celestial concave; we thus find the place of the\r\ncelestial equator, A Q, or _equinoctial_, as it is generally termed in\r\nopposition to the equator, which always means the terrestrial equator.\r\nThe equinoctial divides the heavens into the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres. We cannot actually describe the equinoctial and make it\r\nvisible, but we can imagine its line of direction by observing those\r\nstars through which it passes.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a condition to assign to an observer different stations\r\nin relation to the earth’s axis on the earth’s surface, which will\r\nessentially modify the aspects under which celestial phenomena are\r\nrepresented. One of these stations may be supposed to be at one of the\r\ntwo poles, for example, at _p_, or at any one point of the equator, as\r\nat _a_, or, finally, on any portion of the surface of the earth which\r\nlies between the pole and the equator, as, for example, _o_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 543.—Great Nebulæ in Orion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n MOTION OF THE SUN—THE SEASONS—CHARACTER OF THE SUN—SUNSPOTS—ZODIACAL\r\n LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose that we rise early in the morning we shall, as the reader will\r\nsay see the sun rise—that is, he appears to us to rise as the earth\r\nrotates. By the accompanying diagram (fig. 544) we can understand how\r\nSol makes his appearance, and how he comes up again; not, it will be\r\nobserved, after the manner stated by the Irishman, who declared that\r\nthe sun “went down, and ran round during the night when nobody was\r\nlooking.” The earth rotates from west to east, and so the sun appears\r\nto move from east to west. If we look at the diagram we shall see that\r\nafter rising at O, the sun advances towards the meridian in an oblique\r\narc to A, the highest or culminating point—midday. He then returns,\r\ndescending to W; this path is the diurnal arc. At Q similarly, during\r\nhis passage in the nocturnal arc, he reaches the lowest or inferior\r\nculmination. HH´ is the meridian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 544.—Sun’s motion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 545.—The ecliptic.]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, this path brings the sun on the “ equinoctial”\r\nline mentioned at the close of the last chapter. Day and night are\r\nthen of equal duration as the arcs are equal. So this is the _Vernal_\r\n(or spring) _Equinox_. Some weeks after the sun is at midday higher up\r\nat S´, so the diurnal arc being longer, the day is longer, (Z is the\r\nzenith, Z´ is the nadir, P P´ is the celestial axis). From that time he\r\ndescends _again_ towards the equinoctial to the autumnal equinox, and\r\nso on, the diurnal arc becoming smaller and smaller until the _winter\r\nsolstice_ is reached (S).\r\n\r\nFrom what has been previously said, it is evident that the sun has a\r\ntwofold apparent motion—viz., a circular motion obliquely ascending\r\nfrom the horizon, which is explained by the rotation of the earth,\r\nand by our position, _o_, to the earth’s axis, P P´, and also by a\r\nrising and setting motion between the solstitial points, S and S´,\r\nwhich causes the inequality of the days and nights. Independently of\r\nthe daily motion of the sun, we observe that at the summer solstice,\r\non the 21st of June, at midday, the sun is at S´, and one half year\r\nlater—viz., on the 21st of December, at midnight, the sun is at _s_,\r\nfrom which he arrives again in the space of half a year at S´; so\r\nwe are able to represent this annual motion of the sun by a circle,\r\nthe diameter of which is the line, S´ _s_. This circle is called the\r\n_Ecliptic_.\r\n\r\nThe plane of the ecliptic, S´ _s_, cuts the plane of the equinoctial,\r\nA Q, at an angle of 23½°, and the axis of the ecliptic, S´´´ _s´´_,\r\nmakes the same angle with the axis of the heavens, P P. The two\r\nparallel circles, S´ _s´_ and S _s_, include a zone extending to both\r\nsides of the equinoctial, and beyond which the sun never passes. These\r\ncircles are called the _Tropics_, from τρέπω, _I turn_, because the sun\r\nturns back at these points, and again approaches the equinoctial. The\r\nparallel circles, S´´ _s´´_, and S´´´ _s´´´_, described by the poles of\r\nthe ecliptic, S´´´ _s´´_, about the celestial poles, P P, are called\r\nthe _arctic_ and _antarctic circles_.\r\n\r\nWhenever the sun crosses the equinoctial, there is the equinox; but the\r\npoints of intersection are not invariably the same every year. There\r\nis a gradual westerly movement, so it is a little behind its former\r\ncrossing place every year. (_See_ diagram, fig. 547.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 546.—The Seasons.]\r\n\r\n[This is the “Precession of the Equinoxes,” because the time of\r\nthe equinoxes is hastened, but it is really a retrograde movement.\r\nHipparchus discovered this motion, which amounts to about fifty seconds\r\nin a year. So the whole revolution will be completed in about 28,000\r\nyears.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 547.—Precession of Equinoxes.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that the sun is the most important star in the\r\nuniverse; and when we come to speak about the earth we shall consider\r\nthe seasons, etc., more fully. Now we must endeavour to explain what\r\nthe sun is like, and this can only be done with specially darkened\r\nglasses, for a look at the sun through an ordinary telescope may result\r\nin great, if not permanent, injury to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe sun is not solid so far as we can tell. It is a mass of “white-hot”\r\nvapour, and is enabled to shine by reason of its own light, which the\r\nplanets and stars cannot do; they shine only by the sun’s reflected\r\nlight. So we may conclude the sun to be entirely gaseous, but, thanks\r\nto the recent researches in _spectrum analysis_ (already explained),\r\nby which the light of the sun has been examined by means of the\r\nspectroscope, and split up into its component colours, Mr. Lockyer and\r\nother scientists have discovered that a number of elements (metals)\r\nexist in the sun in a fused, or rather vapourous state, in consequence\r\nof the intense heat. Hydrogen exists in the sun, with other gases\r\nunknown to us here, and many metals, discovered by their _spectra_,\r\nwhich are the same under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe sun is supposed to be spherical in shape,—not like the earth,\r\nflattened at the poles,—and to be composed of materials similar to what\r\nthe earth is composed of, and what it would be if it were as hot as\r\nthe sun is. Thus we can argue by analogy from the _spectra_ of earthly\r\nelements, that, as the sun and star light gives us similar _spectra_,\r\nthe heavenly bodies are composed of the same elements as our globe. We\r\ncan thus form our opinion of the sun’s constitution. Mr. Neisen says:—\r\n\r\n“With the aid, therefore, of the additional information given us by\r\nthe spectroscope, it is not very difficult to form a true idea of the\r\nprobable condition of the surface of the sun, which is all that we can\r\nsee. It is the upper-lying strata of a very dense atmosphere of very\r\nhigh temperature—an atmosphere agitated by storms, whirlwinds, and\r\ncyclones of all kinds, traversed by innumerable currents, and now and\r\nthen broken by violent explosions. Above the brilliant surface which we\r\nsee is a less dense and somewhat cooler upper stratum, which, though\r\nhot enough to shine quite brightly, is quite invisible in the presence\r\nof the brighter strata beneath it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 548.—Sun spots.]\r\n\r\nSUN SPOTS, as they are generally called, are hollows in the sun’s\r\nvapoury substance, and are of enormous extent; and there are brilliant\r\nplaces near those spots, which are termed _faculæ_. These spots have\r\nbeen observed to be changing continuously, and passing from east to\r\nwest across the sun, and then to come again at the east to go over the\r\nsame space again. Now this fact has proved that the sun turns round\r\nupon his axis, and although he does not move as we imagine, from east\r\nto west, round the earth, the orb _does_ move—in fact, the sun has\r\nthree motions: one on his axis; secondly, a motion about the centre of\r\ngravity of the solar system, and a progressive movement towards the\r\nplanet Hercules.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the surface of the sun through a proper telescope, we\r\nshall find that the even surface we can plainly distinguish at sunset\r\nis marked, and the brightness is greater towards the centre of the orb.\r\nWe can perceive various irregularities; we shall find spots, faculæ\r\n(little torches), etc. These spots were discovered by Galileo and other\r\nastronomers, and were, as we have stated, found to be surface markings,\r\nand not a series of bodies passing between the earth and the sun.\r\nThe rotation of the sun was measured, and it was found that the orb\r\nrevolved in about 25⅓ days, and in such a manner as to be slightly\r\ninclined to the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nHerschel observed a spot at least 50,000 miles in diameter, which\r\nis more than six times the diameter of the earth. The sun spots\r\nare observed to be constantly changing, and are naturally observed\r\ndifferently as the revolution proceeds. The dark pole, or “nucleus”\r\n(_umbra_), as it is called, is surrounded by a less dark surface called\r\nthe _penumbra_, but the umbra is not really dark; it is extremely\r\nbright when viewed alone, as has been proved by Professor Langley,\r\nwhile the heat is even greater in proportion. But the umbra of a sun\r\nspot must be below the level of the penumbra, for the shape changed\r\nas the sun revolved on its axis. The penumbra was wider on the side\r\nnearest the edge of the solar disc, and the umbra may be due to the\r\nuprushing or downpouring of gas or vapour like “whirlpools in the solar\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\nNear the sun spots the long streaks, or _faculæ_, are often observed\r\nby the borders of the disc, and a transition of the luminous part of\r\nthe photosphere[26] into darkness has been observed, and bright bridges\r\ncrossing the spots, and then gradually getting dark, were seen by M.\r\nChacomac. The sun spots vary in direction, but the same general course\r\nis continued. Sometimes they describe curves, sometimes lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 549.—Direction of sun spots.]\r\n\r\nDuring solar eclipses the sun exhibits what are termed “red\r\nprominences,” which are the luminous vapours existing around the sun.\r\nWhen the orb is eclipsed, we can see the bright-coloured vapours\r\nshooting out from underneath the dark shadow, and this light is\r\ntermed the “coronal atmosphere”; the vapours are called the sun’s\r\n_chromosphere_. In the coronal atmosphere are certain curious shapes\r\nof vapour thrown up, and frequently changing,—projecting, in fact,\r\nfrom the gaseous envelope. These red prominences were first observed\r\nin 1842, and in 1851 it was proved that they appertained to the sun,\r\nfor the moon hid them as the eclipse began. Before the prominences\r\nwere discovered, the red light surrounding the solar disc was known,\r\nand called the “sierra” (now chromosphere), or chromatosphere. “The\r\nluminosity of these prominences is intense,” says Secchi, “and\r\nthey rise often to a height of 80,000 miles, and occasionally to\r\nmore than twice that; then bending back, they fall again upon the\r\nsun like the jets of our fountains. Then they spread into figures\r\nresembling gigantic trees, more or less rich in branches.” We give some\r\nillustrations of the appearances of these prominences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 550.—Solar prominences.]\r\n\r\nThe _zodiacal light_ is often observed. It is a glow, and frequently\r\nof a rosy tint. It may be seen in England in March or April before\r\nsunset, or in the autumn before sunrise; and it is doubtful whether it\r\nbe a terrestrial or an extra-terrestrial light—a lens-shaped object\r\nsurrounding the sun. Some philosophers maintain that the light is\r\ncaused by multitudes of minute bodies travelling round the sun; but\r\nHerr Gronemann has lately fully discussed the observations, and the\r\ndrift of his contention is under stated:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 551.—Solar prominences.]\r\n\r\nThere are valid observations against two items in the support of\r\nthe old theory—viz., the affirmed connection of the evening and\r\nmorning cones seen on the same night (if the corresponding sides be\r\nprolonged), and the participation of the cones in the daily motion of\r\nthe heavens. The zodiacal light is sometimes seen when daylight has\r\nnot yet disappeared; and, on the other hand, it sometimes fails to\r\nappear, though there is complete darkness. There would seem to be a\r\nreal lengthening and shortening. It has been observed by Schiaparelli,\r\nthat the light is much more difficult to make out when it passes\r\nthrough the meridian, than when it is only 30° above the horizon,\r\nand is less easily seen when the air is clearest than when a sort of\r\nmist is present. Indeed, the bright parts of the Milky Way may be\r\nseen to be weakened by mist, while the zodiacal light at the same\r\nheight is unaffected. The zodiacal light has temporary variations of\r\nlight intensity, and it shows from time to time remarkable changes\r\nof form and position, so sudden and short as to be hard to explain\r\non the planetary hypothesis. The elongations of the cones show a\r\nhalf-yearly period, which is independent of the transparency of the\r\nair. The cone follows the observer northwards or southwards, so that\r\nthere is no parallactic action; and this peculiarity (so adverse to\r\nthe extra-terrestrial hypothesis) cannot be explained by reflection\r\nor absorption of light. As to spectroscopic observations, the author\r\nfinds (1) that the zodiacal light consists partly of proper light; (2)\r\nthat its connection with polar light is but secondary, temporary, and\r\naccidental; (3) that the cause of the second phenomenon is such that it\r\nmay strengthen the zodiacal light and modify its spectrum; and (4) that\r\nthe results of spectrum analysis rank with other arguments tending to\r\nfind the source of the zodiacal light in the neighbourhood of the earth\r\n(like the polar light). Herr Gronemann, then, thinks the zodiacal light\r\na terrestrial phenomenon, though he will not say that it cannot be\r\ninfluenced by cosmic action. He throws out the suggestion that the cone\r\nmay be a kind of optical illusion, arising from some fine matter—gas\r\nor dust—being more accumulated near the observer in one direction\r\nthan another. The apparent length of the cone might be conditioned by\r\nthe conical shadow of the earth, and the changes of length be due to\r\ncosmic and electric influences. In any case, there is need of a more\r\nscientific theory than the old one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 552.—On the sun’s disc.]\r\n\r\nWe may conclude our brief notice of the great luminary to which we are\r\nindebted for everything, by a _resumé_ of his distance from us, his\r\ndiameter, and a few other plain facts and figures. In the first place\r\nthe actual distance of the sun from the earth has never accurately\r\nbeen determined, but perhaps the next transit of Venus will assist\r\nthe observers to a nearer estimate. It is quite sufficient for our\r\npurpose, however, to state that the sun’s distance from the earth is\r\n92,000,000 of miles. The distance varies in winter and summer. In the\r\nformer period the sun is _nearer_ than in summer, and yet as the rays\r\nstrike over us, and pass us, as it were, we feel less heat. When, as in\r\nsummer, we are more in the focus of the rays, we feel the greater heat.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of _parallax_, and it is by finding the solar\r\nparallax that the distance of the sun from us is found. This parallax\r\nhas not been exactly ascertained, or rather authorities differ, and as\r\ndifference of 0·01´´ in the solar parallax means something over 100,000\r\nmiles of distance, it is evident that exactness is almost impossible.\r\nIf 8´´·80 be settled as the solar parallax, 92,880,000 miles is the\r\ndistance of the sun from the earth. If 8´´·88 be taken we have nearly\r\n92,000,000 exactly.\r\n\r\nThe _volume_ of the sun is 1,253,000 times that of the earth, and yet\r\nthe _density_ of the former is only about one-fourth of the latter, so\r\nthe attraction of gravitation at the sun must be more than that of the\r\nearth’s surface twenty-seven times. A body dropped near the surface\r\nof the sun would fall 436 feet in the first second, and have attained\r\na velocity of ten miles a minute at the end of the first second. The\r\ndiameter of the sun depends in our calculations upon its distance from\r\nthe earth. If we suppose that to be 92,880,000 miles, the diameter is\r\n866,000 miles. If we take 91,000,000 of miles as the distance from\r\nthe earth the diameter is 850,467 miles. The sun makes (apparently)\r\nthe circuit of the heavens in 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9·6\r\nseconds; the transit from one vernal equinox to the next being only 365\r\ndays, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 48·6 seconds, owing to the precession of the\r\nequinoxes already mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the power and grandeur of the sun we may well feel\r\nlost in the contemplation. The sun balances the planets and keeps\r\nthem in their orbits. He gives us the light and heat we enjoy, and\r\ncoal-gas is merely “bottled-up sunlight.” In darkness nothing will come\r\nto maturity. We obtain rain and dew owing to the sun’s evaporative\r\npower; and no action could go on upon earth without the sun; and yet we\r\nreceive only about 1/2070650000 part of its heat and light.\r\n\r\nAs to the colour of the sun, Professor Langley states that it is really\r\nblue, and not the white disc we see. The whiteness is due to the effect\r\nof absorption exerted by the vapourous metallic atmosphere surrounding\r\nour luminary; and if that atmosphere were removed, his colour would\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The bright part of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH.\r\n\r\n FORM OF THE EARTH—MOTION OF THE GLOBE—RATE AND MANNER OF\r\n PROGRESSION—LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE—THE SEASONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have learnt from our books on Geography that the earth is shaped\r\nlike an orange,—that is, our globe is round and flattened slightly at\r\nthe “poles,” and we can easily see that the earth curves away, if we\r\nonly try the experiment mentioned in a foregoing chapter—viz., how far\r\na person standing (or lying) on the ground can see on a level. Our\r\npower of eyesight is not limited to three or four miles, but a man of\r\nordinary height standing on the plain cannot see more than three miles,\r\n_because the earth is curving away from him_.\r\n\r\nWe know that at the seaside we can see ships gradually appear and\r\ndisappear. When approaching us the masts and top-sails appear first,\r\nthen the main-sails, and then the ship itself. A sailor climbing up the\r\nmast can see farther than the captain on deck, because he can see over\r\nthe curve, as it were. When the vessel is at a considerable distance\r\nwe see her “hull down” as it is termed,—that is, only her sails are\r\nvisible to us, and at last they disappear also. If we want any other\r\nproof that the earth is round we can see when an eclipse takes place\r\nthat the shadow on the moon is circular. So we may be certain of one\r\nfact; the earth is round, it is a globe. So much for the rotundity of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nBut the earth appears to us, except in very mountainous districts, as\r\nbeing almost a plane. This is because of its extent; and even from very\r\nhigh mountains we can only see a very small portion of the earth, and\r\nso, on a globe sixteen inches in diameter, the highest hills would be\r\nonly about 1/100 of an inch, like a grain of sand.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earth is known to most people, though as everything\r\nupon the globe passes with it, and a relative fixity is apparent, this\r\nis, of course, not real rest. The earth is moving from west to east\r\nat a tremendous rate,—viz., nearly nineteen miles a second! We think\r\na train at sixty miles an hour a fast train; but what should we think\r\nof an express going more than 68,000 miles an hour! Yet this is about\r\nthe rate at which our globe whirls around the sun. Her fastest pace is\r\nreally 18·5 miles a second; the least about one mile per second less.\r\n\r\nThat is one motion of the earth; the other is its motion on its axis.\r\nIf we send a skittle ball rolling we perceive it turns round as it\r\nproceeds. So the earth rotates on its axis, N S, in the accompanying\r\ndiagram; the extremities of the axis are called the _poles_. The line\r\nin the middle is the equator, which is divided into 360 equal parts,\r\neach being 69-1/10 miles in length; so there are 180 lines, or rings,\r\ndrawn upon the globe from N to S, and these are _meridians_. In England\r\nthe degrees are calculated from the Greenwich meridian. We can thus\r\nobtain the distance of localities east or west, as we may briefly show\r\n(fig. 554).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 553.—Evidence of the spherical form of the earth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 554.—Latitude and Longitude.]\r\n\r\nThe distance of any meridian from the first meridian is termed the\r\n_longitude_, and it is employed in describing the situation of a place\r\non the earth’s surface. Suppose L (fig. 554) a city, its longitude will\r\nbe 30°, since it lies on a meridian which is 30° from the first. So,\r\nfor example, the longitude of Oporto is 8° 37´ west, Paris 2° 22´ east,\r\nVienna 16° 16´ east, Bagdad 44° 45´ east, reckoned from the meridian of\r\nGreenwich, and so on. At the 180th degree we have proceeded half round\r\nthe globe, and reached the farthest distance from the first meridian,\r\nand are now on the opposite side of the earth, and proceeding in a\r\nsimilar manner in the opposite direction we get west longitude.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be perceived that a knowledge of the longitude alone\r\nis not sufficient to determine the situation of a place on the earth’s\r\nsurface. When we say, for example, that the longitude of a place is\r\n30°, it may lie on any point whatever of the line, N L S, on the whole\r\nhemisphere (fig. 554). This point must therefore be determined more\r\naccurately, and hence the first meridian is divided into 90 equal parts\r\nnorth and south of the equator towards the poles. These are called\r\n_degrees of latitude_, and the lines drawn through these round the\r\nglobe, parallel to the equator, are called circles or _parallels of\r\nlatitude_, and diminish as they approach the poles.\r\n\r\nHence, by the _latitude_ of a place we mean its distance from the\r\nequator towards the poles, and we speak of north and south latitude\r\naccording as the place is situated in the northern or southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, the point L (fig. 554), which has 30° longitude and\r\n60° N. latitude is in Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe latitude is also observable by ascertaining the altitude of the\r\npolar star above the horizon when in the northern hemisphere. The\r\nlongitude is found by the chronometer; for if we know the time at\r\nGreenwich we can calculate how far we are east or west of it by seeing\r\nwhether the local time be an hour (say) earlier or later, and that\r\ndifference shows we are 15° to the east or the west as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s rotation, according to sidereal time, is less than solar\r\ntime, as we have seen, so we have 365 solar days and 366 sidereal days;\r\nso a person going round the world gains or loses a day as he travels\r\neast or west according to his reckoning, as compared with the reckoning\r\nof his friends at home. We can easily ascertain the earth’s motion by\r\nwatching the stars rise and set. Now the path in which the earth moves\r\nis called an _ellipse_,—very nearly a circle,—but it does not always\r\nmove at the same rate exactly. We will now look at the relations of the\r\nsun and the earth.\r\n\r\nLet us take an example. Suppose we have a rod, at each end of which we\r\nfix a ball (_see_ diagram), and let one ball be three times as large as\r\nthe other, the common centre of gravity will be at _c_, at one quarter\r\nof the distance between the centres, and there the bodies will be in\r\nequilibrium. If these masses be set spinning into space they will\r\nrevolve at that distance from each other, the attraction of gravitation\r\nand the force in opposition to it equalizing each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 555.—Earth and Sun.]\r\n\r\nThe earth, as we know, proceeds with a tremendous force around the\r\nsun, not in a circle, remember, but in an ellipse or oval track, from\r\nwhich it never moves year by year in any appreciable degree. Now what\r\nprevents this earth of ours from rushing off by itself into space? Why\r\nshould not the earth fly away in a direct line? The reason is because\r\nthe sun holds it back. The force of the sun’s gravitation is just\r\nsufficient, or we may say so enormously great, that it suffices to\r\nretain our globe and all the other planets in their various orbits at\r\nthe very same distance, and to counteract the force which launches them\r\nthrough space. Therefore, as we have already noticed when considering\r\nthe sun, it is to that ruler of the day that we are indebted for\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen, then, if the earth were suddenly to increase her\r\nvelocity, or the sun to contract his mass?—We should be flung into\r\ninfinite space, and in a short time would be frozen up completely.\r\nOur present diurnal course would probably proceed, but all life and\r\nexistence would cease as we whirled with distant planets through\r\ninfinity.\r\n\r\nSuppose, on the contrary, we were to stop suddenly. We have some of\r\nus read in a foregoing part of this volume that heat is the motion\r\nof molecules in ether, and that when a body strikes another heat is\r\ndeveloped by contact and friction. If the earth were to be stopped\r\nsuddenly, “an amount of heat would be developed sufficient to raise the\r\ntemperature of a globe of lead of the same size as the earth 384,000°\r\nof the Centigrade thermometer. The greater part, if not the whole of\r\nour planet, would be reduced to vapour”, as Professor Tyndall says.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 556.—Transit of earth across Sun, seen from Mars.]\r\n\r\nIn the diagram (fig. 546, on page 497) we shall at once find the\r\nexplanation of the constantly-recurring seasons, and the amount of our\r\nglobe which is illuminated by the sun at various times. It will be\r\neasily understood that the poles have six months day and six months\r\nnight. When the earth is at an equinox, one half of the surface is\r\nilluminated and the other half in shade, therefore the days and nights\r\nare equal. But when the north pole turns more and more towards the sun,\r\nthe south pole is turning away from it in the same ratio,—the days and\r\nnights respectively are getting longer and longer, and at the north\r\nand south poles day and night are continuous, for the small spaces\r\nround the poles are, during a certain period, wholly in sunshine and\r\nshade respectively.\r\n\r\nIn March (in the diagram, fig. 546) we see that exactly one half of\r\nthe earth is illuminated, and the other is darkened. So in September,\r\nwhen we have the opposite view. In June the earth is more inclined\r\napparently to the sun, and more of the surface is exposed to it, so\r\nthe days are longer in some parts. The opposite effect is visible in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe summer heat and winter cold are accounted for by the more or less\r\ndirect force of the sun’s rays, for the more the angle of incidence\r\nis inclined the fewer rays reach the object; and if the rays fall at\r\nan angle of 60°, the heat is only half what it would be if they came\r\nvertically. When the days are shortest the sun is lowest, and therefore\r\ngives less heat to the earth at certain periods.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful precision which has adapted the position of the earth on\r\nits axis, will be apparent from the illustration (fig. 557). Here we\r\nhave a table and some bottles, a candle to represent the sun, and a\r\nball of worsted and a knitting-needle to represent the earth and its\r\naxis. Suppose we place the ball in the position at _a_, with its axis\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the orbit. As the earth would turn and\r\ngo round the sun in this supposed case, we should find the days and\r\nnights equal, and the sun would quickly scorch up the tropics, and\r\nthe other portions would have a never-changing spring or winter all\r\nthe year for ever. This would not be so pleasant, for variety is the\r\ncharm of nature, and the salt of life. So we may put _a_ aside, as\r\nthe earth would be scarcely habitable under the supposed conditions,\r\nand try _b_. Here we find the poles directed to the sun. The whole\r\nnorthern hemisphere would thus be illuminated one half year, and the\r\nsouthern similarly; such rapid changes from heat to cold and back again\r\nwould not suit us. So we fall back upon _c_, the actual appearance of\r\nthe position of the earth, and here we find all the most favourable\r\ncircumstances existing for us. This inclination gives rise to all the\r\nvaried phenomena of the pleasant gradations of heat and cold, summer\r\nand winter, the charming changes of season, and the wonderful results\r\nof the ever-recurring days and nights, months and years, as the earth\r\nspins round. So we see that the sun does not really rise and set upon\r\nthe earth; the globe rotates, and brings us into view of the sun, and\r\nas we turn we lose his light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 557.—Inclination of Axis.]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing brief description we have learnt some few facts\r\nconcerning our earth. We have ascertained that the planet we inhabit\r\nis round; we have also seen that the earth moves around the sun and\r\naround its own axis, and also that it moves at a tremendous rate; we\r\nknow that that rate is just counterbalanced by the attraction of\r\ngravitation, and the course round the sun gives us varying seasons, day\r\nand night. There are many subjects relating to the earth which will be\r\nmore properly included under Physical Geography. We may here just add\r\nthe diameter of the earth, and proceed to inquire concerning the moon.\r\nThe polar diameter of our globe is 7,899 miles; the equatorial diameter\r\n7,925 miles. It is distant from the moon 238,500 miles. We will close\r\nthis chapter with the letters and characters of the Greek alphabet used\r\nin astronomical works to designate the stars.\r\n\r\n  Α α = Alpha\r\n  Β β = Beta\r\n  Γ γ = Gamma\r\n  Δ δ = Delta\r\n  Ε ε = Epsilon\r\n  Ζ ζ = Zeta\r\n  Ê ê = Eta\r\n  Θ θ = Theta\r\n  Ι ι = Iota\r\n  Κ κ = Kappa\r\n  Λ λ = Lambda\r\n  Μ μ = Mu\r\n  Ν ν = Nu\r\n  Ξ ξ = Xi\r\n  Ο ο = Omicron\r\n  Π π = Pi\r\n  Ρ ρ = Rho\r\n  Σ ς = Sigma\r\n  Τ τ = Tau\r\n  Υ υ = Upsilon\r\n  Φ φ = Phi\r\n  Χ χ = Chi\r\n  Ψ ψ = Psi\r\n  Ω ω = Omega\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 558.—A ship disappearing below the horizon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.\r\n\r\n WHAT IS IT LIKE?—MOON SUPERSTITIONS—DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\n MOON—PHASES—TIDES—ECLIPSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the early days of childhood every man and woman has been familiar\r\nwith the moon. This satellite of earth has been domesticated, so\r\nto speak, amongst us; and while the sun and other stars have been\r\nglorified in poetic and prose effusions, the moon has been always more\r\ntenderly addressed. The soft (reflected) light of our attendant moon\r\nis much more attractive than the brilliancy of the greater light “that\r\nrules the day.” The moon is regarded as our particular property, and\r\nhas awakened an interest in our minds since the time that we could, as\r\nwe fancied, see the “Man in the Moon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 559.—The earth as seen from the moon.]\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the moon was supposed to possess some light of her\r\nown, and to be inhabited by immense creatures; and various theories\r\ncontinued to be promulgated respecting her, until the telescope came\r\ninto use, and then astronomers began to find out many new things\r\nconcerning Luna. Now, what has the telescope told us regarding our\r\nmoon?—It shows us that there are mountains and craters, and numerous\r\ntraces of volcanic action. At one time it was supposed that the dark\r\nmasses apparent in the surface of the moon, and which can easily be\r\ndistinguished by the naked eye, were seas, and maps of the moon were\r\nmade, marking continents and craters.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to reach the moon, as M. Jules Verne’s travellers\r\ndid, we should find a very irregular and corrugated surface—plains and\r\nmountains without water. We should be able to see the stars in the\r\ndaytime, because there is no atmosphere around the moon, and there is\r\na silence that “might be felt.” The appearance of our earth from the\r\nmoon, and the beauty of the stars in the unclouded and waterless space\r\naround the satellite, must be very grand, and has been, in a measure,\r\ndepicted in the illustration (fig. 559) on the opposite page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 560.—The Moon: the ring plain Copernicus.]\r\n\r\nIn this illustration (fig. 560) we have some idea what the moon is\r\nlike. We see the rugged and cratered appearance of the disc; it is a\r\ndesert waste, so far as we can ascertain, without inhabitants, and,\r\nin all probability, without vegetation. For there being no moisture\r\namongst the plains and craters and mountains of our satellite, we\r\nmust conclude that the moon is dead. It is a very interesting,—nay,\r\na fascinating study. When we take up our telescope and look from the\r\nwindow at the heavens the most beautiful object within our small\r\ntelescopic vision is the moon shining like a silver plate, and we\r\nwonder what is up there. With a small telescope even we can discern\r\nmany interesting features in the moon at the full, which will assist us\r\nin verifying the diagrams in books and their explanations.\r\n\r\nAs the moon is only a few miles away, comparatively speaking, and as\r\nthe large telescopes now in use bring us within a measurable distance\r\nof the surface, we are enabled to speak more positively about our\r\nchangeable satellite than of any of the planets. When we look steadily\r\nat the full moon we perceive upon its surface dark and light tracts\r\ncalled “seas,” though they are dried up now. Thus we hear of the “Sea\r\nof Serenity,” the “Sea of Storms,” and the “Sea of Tranquillity”; and\r\nin the map upon a subsequent page you may see the names of the seas,\r\nmountains, and the general formations of the surface of the moon. Maps\r\nof the moon are now to be procured, though no personal visits can be\r\nmade to the satellite. It is very interesting to observe or to read\r\nabout the structure of the moon, for we may thus learn how similar the\r\nearth and her attendant are in formation; but one important agency—that\r\nof water—has made a considerable difference in the _appearance_ of the\r\nformations. In the moon we have mountains, plains, and rugged craters;\r\nthe surface is not level, because the sunlight is visible sooner at\r\nsome points than others. The chief mountain chain is the Apennines, and\r\nhas a great elevation; many traces of volcanic agency are discoverable\r\namid the great desolation, and awful silence reigns throughout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 561.—Telescopic appearance of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, water has a great erosive power, and its action\r\ndisintegrates the surface of the earth with rapid persistency. So the\r\nphysical appearance of the globe has become much changed in the course\r\nof ages: ravines exist where plains used to extend, and rivers cut\r\ntheir way through deep gorges to the sea. The sands and other deposits\r\nare overlaid, and thus the whole outward appearance has been altered.\r\nNot so the moon. With a very attenuated atmosphere without clouds or\r\nrain, there is no moisture, no lake, no water in the moon now. What may\r\nhave been we can only conjecture. If there ever have been lakes or seas\r\nthey have all been absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 562.—Formations near Mostig. Low power.]\r\n\r\nThe heat upon one side of the moon must be very great at one period,\r\nand the cold on the opposite side intense, as one would think—yet\r\nupon this fact authorities differ somewhat. If the moon possess no\r\natmosphere of _any kind_ it would be fearfully cold and extremely hot\r\nat intervals, but a surrounding medium, even of very little density,\r\nwould modify the extremes; and while we must accept the fact that the\r\ntemperature varies very much we need not place it above 100° of heat,\r\nnor below 20° of cold. So from close observation and comparison we are\r\nenabled to form a very fair opinion of the “past” of the moon, and\r\nto ascertain that the same forces of nature which have moulded the\r\nplanet we inhabit, have been at work in the moon also. When we study\r\n“Selenography,” therefore, we shall find a record of a history which\r\nmay some day bear a parallel to the history of our physical world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 563.—The ring-plain Copernicus, as seen with small\r\nmagnifying power.]\r\n\r\nThe moon, as all are aware, moves round the earth attendant upon us,\r\nbut entirely under the control of the sun; our satellite, moreover,\r\nhas been the subject of many superstitions. A great many rites and\r\neven domestic actions—such as the killing of fowls—were regulated by\r\nthe moon; and in Scotland, Scandinavia, and other portions of Europe,\r\nshe has always been regarded as effecting destiny. There are many\r\ninteresting myths connected with the moon, and indeed with astronomy\r\ngenerally, and from a volume entitled “Notes on Unnatural History,”\r\nsome very amusing extracts might be made. It will not be out of place\r\nto mention a few of these myths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 564.—The walled-plain Plato.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have an idea that a rabbit exists in the moon, and is the\r\ncause of the shadows we see. The Buddhists think a holy hare is up\r\nthere. In the Pacific Islands there is a belief of a woman in the moon;\r\nshe was sent there because she wished her child to have a bit of it to\r\neat; and Mr. Buchanan has versified the old Scandinavian myth about the\r\ntwo children kidnapped by the moon as they returned from a well with a\r\nbucket of water slung upon a pole. The Jews placed Jacob in the moon,\r\nand the Italians say that Cain inhabits the luminary with a dog and\r\na thorn bush. In the _Inferno_ of Dante this is referred to, and we\r\nknow that in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ we have the moon coming out\r\nto shine upon the loves of Pyramus and Thisbe with the dog and the\r\nthorn-bush; and in the _Tempest_ the same idea is mentioned by Caliban.\r\nReaders of Longfellow will recall the lines how “the good Nokomis\r\nanswered” Hiawatha, who asked about the moon—\r\n\r\n    “Once a warrior, very angry,\r\n    Seized his grandmother, and threw her\r\n    Up into the sky at midnight.\r\n    Right against the moon he threw her,\r\n    ‘Tis her body that you see there.”\r\n\r\nBut modern scientific research has exploded all these charming old\r\nmyths, and laid bare the facts for us. We must now resume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 565.—Map of Moon showing principal formations.\r\n\r\n  A Mare Crisium.\r\n  B Palus Somnii.\r\n  C Mare Serenitatis.\r\n  D Mare Tranquillitatis.\r\n  E Mare Fœcunditatis.\r\n  F Mare Nectaris.\r\n  G Sinus Medii.\r\n  H Mare Vaporum.\r\n  I Lacus Mortis.\r\n  J Mare Frigoris.\r\n  K Mare Imbrium.\r\n  L Oceanus Procellarum.\r\n  M Mare Humorum.\r\n  N Mare Nubium.\r\n  O Sinus Iridium.\r\n\r\n  _a_ Apennine Mts.\r\n  _b_ Caucasus.\r\n  _c_ Carpathians.\r\n  _d_ Pyrenees.\r\n  _e_ Altai Mts.\r\n  _f_ Riphaen Mts.\r\n  _g_ Doerfel Mts.\r\n  _h_ Leibnitz Mts.\r\n  _i_ Corderillas.\r\n  _j_ D’Alembert Mts.\r\n  _k_ Taurus Mts.\r\n  _l_ Hæmus Mts.\r\n  _m_ Alps.\r\n\r\n   1 Clavius.\r\n   2 Maginus.\r\n   3 Maurolycus.\r\n   4 Stöfler.\r\n   5 Tycho.\r\n   6 Longomontanus.\r\n   7 Wilhelm I.\r\n   8 Schiller.\r\n   9 Schickhardt.\r\n  10 Hainzel.\r\n  11 Furnerius.\r\n  12 Metius.\r\n  13 Fabricius.\r\n  14 Riccius.\r\n  15 Piccolomini.\r\n  16 Zagut.\r\n  17 Apianus.\r\n  18 Walter.\r\n  19 Hell.\r\n  20 Pitatus.\r\n  21 Hesiodus.\r\n  22 Capuanus.\r\n  23 Ramsden.\r\n  24 Vieta.\r\n  25 Petavius.\r\n  25 Vendelinus.\r\n  27 Langrenus.\r\n  28 Fracastorius.\r\n  29 Theophilus.\r\n  30 Cyrillus.\r\n  31 Catharina.\r\n  32 Sacrobosco.\r\n  33 Almanon.\r\n  34 Albufeda.\r\n  35 Albategnius.\r\n  36 Hipparchus.\r\n  37 Ptolemy.\r\n  38 Alphonsus.\r\n  39 Purbach.\r\n  40 Regiomontanus.\r\n  41 Thebit.\r\n  42 Arzachel.\r\n  43 Bullialdus.\r\n  44 Lalande.\r\n  45 Mösting.\r\n  46 Herschel.\r\n  47 Gassendi.\r\n  48 Mersenius.\r\n  49 Sirsalis.\r\n  50 Grimaldi.\r\n  51 Riccioli.\r\n  52 Hevelius.\r\n  53 Condorcet.\r\n  54 Taruntius.\r\n  55 Proclus.\r\n  56 Cleomedes.\r\n  57 Romer.\r\n  58 Posidonius.\r\n  59 Plinius.\r\n  60 Julius Cæsar.\r\n  61 Manilius.\r\n  62 Godin.\r\n  63 Agrippa.\r\n  64 Triesnecker.\r\n  65 Bode.\r\n  66 Gambart.\r\n  67 Eratosthenes.\r\n  68 Copernicus.\r\n  69 Reinhold.\r\n  70 Landsberg.\r\n  71 Encke.\r\n  72 Kepler.\r\n  73 Marius.\r\n  74 Archimedes.\r\n  75 Timocharis.\r\n  76 Euler.\r\n  77 Aristarchus.\r\n  78 Herodotus.\r\n  79 Struve.\r\n  80 Messala.\r\n  81 Mare Humboldtanius.\r\n  82 Atlas.\r\n  83 Hercules.\r\n  84 Endymion.\r\n  85 Eudoxus.\r\n  86 Aristoteles.\r\n  87 Linne.\r\n  88 Autolycus.\r\n  89 Aristillus.\r\n  90 Cassini.\r\n  91 Plato.\r\n  92 Helicon.\r\n  93 Pythagoras.]\r\n\r\nThe moon moves around us in 27^d 7^h 43^m 11·461^s. Its diameter is\r\nabout 2,160 miles, and it is much less dense than our earth, and so\r\nthe force of gravity is less there than here. Its mean distance from\r\nus is 238,833 miles. The moon goes through certain changes or phases\r\nevery twenty-nine days or so; and while rotating on its own axis our\r\nsatellite goes round the earth, so that we only see one side of the\r\nmoon, inasmuch as the two motions occupy almost exactly the same space\r\nof time. So we generally see the same space of the moon, though there\r\nis a slight variation at times. This movement or swaying of the central\r\npoint is called the moon’s “libration,” and is an optical effect, due\r\nto the inequalities in the motion of the moon in its orbit, and to the\r\ninclination of its equator and orbit to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWe append a map of the moon, on which the mountains, seas, and craters\r\ncan be perceived, according to the list. The hill ranges extend for\r\nhundreds of miles, and the elevation reaches 30,000 feet, and even\r\nmore in places. The so-called craters do not resemble volcanoes when\r\nviewed closely, but take the form of basins or valleys surrounded by\r\nlofty hills. One great plain called Copernicus is more than fifty miles\r\nacross. Respecting the appearance of the moon let us quote Mr. Lockyer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 566.—The Apennines and walled plain Archimedes.]\r\n\r\n“Fancy a world without water, and therefore without ice, cloud, rain,\r\nsnow; without rivers or streams, and therefore without vegetation to\r\nsupport animal life;—a world without twilight or any gradations between\r\nthe fiercest sunshine and the blackest night; a world also without\r\nsound, for as sound is carried by the air, the highest mountain on the\r\nairless moon might be riven by an earthquake inaudibly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASES OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the moon revolves around the earth in the same time\r\nas she turns upon her own axis, and always presents one side to us when\r\nshe appears. Any one can ascertain this by putting a candle upon a\r\nround table, and walk round it facing the candle. The experimentalist\r\nwill find that he will turn upon his own axis as well as turn around\r\nthe table. Thus we shall see how the moon changes, for to be as\r\nchangeable as the moon is proverbial. These different aspects or phases\r\nwe shall now proceed to explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 567.—Phases of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nThe time intervening between one “new” moon and another is 29^d, 12^h,\r\n44^m, 2^s, and is termed a synodic revolution. This is longer than\r\nthe sidereal revolution, because the earth is also moving in the same\r\ndirection and the moon has to make up the time the earth has got on in\r\nfront, as it were. So the moon travels nearly thirteen times round the\r\nearth while the latter is going round the sun.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of the moon have been a measurement of time for ages,\r\nand her varying appearances during lunation are always observed with\r\ninterest. The illustration (fig. 567) will assist us materially. The\r\nsun’s rays fall in a parallel direction upon the earth and moon, and\r\nlet us suppose that S is the sun in the diagram and T the earth; C at\r\nthe various points is the moon, the capital letters, A, B, C, etc.,\r\nindicating the planet as she appears from the sun, and the small\r\nletters show how she appears to us from the earth.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the sun, earth, and moon are in conjunction—or in\r\na direct line. The phases, C and G, are the moon’s “quadratures.” At\r\nA we see the sun shining on the moon, but we only have the dark side.\r\nIt is then “new” moon; but by degrees, as she goes round in her orbit,\r\nwe perceive a small crescent-shaped portion, lighted up by the sun at\r\nB and _b_. At _c´_ we have the first quarter or half-moon. When she is\r\nin opposition she is at full moon, and so on to the last quarter and\r\nconjunction again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 568.—Crescent Moon.]\r\n\r\nThe moon’s phases may be easily shown by means of a medium-sized lamp\r\nto represent the earth, a smaller one to serve as moon, and a light to\r\nact as sun all at the same height. Colour the “lunar” globe white, and\r\nif we move it about the “earth” globe, we shall see the various phases\r\nof the moon in the sharp shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIDES.\r\n\r\nThe ebb and flow of our tidal waters depend upon the moon to a great\r\nextent. The phenomenon is so common, that we need only refer to it, but\r\nthe cause of the tides may be stated. Twice every day we have the tides\r\ntwelve hours apart, and the flow and ebb are merely examples of the\r\nattraction of gravitation, which is exercised upon all bodies, either\r\nliquid or solid. The tides are highest at the equator and lowest at the\r\npoles, because the tropics are more exposed to the influence of the\r\nlunar attraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 569.—Moon’s attraction.]\r\n\r\nBy the small diagram (fig. 569) we shall be able to see in a moment how\r\nthe moon acts. The moon being nearer to the earth at _b_, the water\r\nwill be naturally attracted to the ball, _m_, and cause high water\r\n(_a_); and a similar effect will be produced opposite, because the\r\nearth is attracted, so the waves are higher than the ground which has\r\nbeen attracted away from the water, and the waters will flow in and\r\ncause a high tide at _d_, but not _so_ high a tide as at the opposite\r\npoint, _a_. It can then be understood that there will be low water at\r\nthe other two sides, _e_ and _f_, because the water has been taken\r\naway, so to speak, for the high tides at _a_ and _d_. We shall learn\r\nmore of this under Physical Geography.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 570.—New Moon.]\r\n\r\nThe moon revolves round the earth in a changeable elliptical orbit,\r\nintersecting the ecliptic at certain points called _Nodes_. When the\r\nmoon is nearest to the Earth she is said to be in _perigee_ when\r\nfarthest from us she is in _apogee_ (the line uniting these points is\r\nthe line of _apsides_), the difference in distance being about 4,000\r\nmiles. She passes the sun periodically, and so if the moon moved in the\r\nplane of the ecliptic there would be eclipses of the sun and moon twice\r\na month; but as the orbit is inclined a little, she escapes by moving\r\nnorth or south. We will now endeavour to explain this theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nECLIPSES.\r\n\r\nWe have briefly considered the SUN and EARTH and the MOON separately.\r\nWe are now about to regard the effects produced by them when they come\r\nin each other’s way and cause ECLIPSES, which are observed with so much\r\ninterest. There are eclipses of the sun and of the moon. The former\r\noccur at the time of new moon, and the latter at full moon; and this\r\nwill be at once understood when we remember that the sun is eclipsed\r\nby the moon passing between us and the sun; and the moon is eclipsed\r\nbecause the _shadow of the earth_ falls upon her when she is _opposite_\r\nthe sun, and therefore “full.”\r\n\r\nReaders of the voyages of Columbus will remember that he managed to\r\nobtain supplies from negatively hostile Jamaica savages by pretending\r\nto cause an eclipse of the moon, which he knew was about to take place,\r\nand to the ancients eclipses were of dire portent. Even in enlightened\r\nRome, to ascribe an eclipse to the causes of nature was a crime. The\r\nChinese have an idea that great dragons are devouring the moon when she\r\nis eclipsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 571.—Solar eclipse with corona.]\r\n\r\nThere are total, partial, and annular eclipses. The former terms speak\r\nfor themselves; the latter name is derived from “annulus,” a ring; for\r\na ring of light is left around the dark portion eclipsed, and is only\r\nseen in solar eclipses. In one sense the eclipse of the sun is really\r\nan eclipse of the earth, because it is caused by the shadow of the moon\r\nfalling upon the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 572.—Umbra and penumbra.]\r\n\r\nIf a bright body, A, be larger than the dark body, B, there will be two\r\nkinds of shadows—viz., the _umbra_ and the _penumbra_. For instance,\r\nthe umbra is the central dark part in the cut (fig. 572), and the\r\npenumbra is the lighter portion. As soon as the eye is placed on the\r\numbra, it can perceive no part of the source of light, A, which appears\r\nto be eclipsed. On the other hand, the _penumbra_ originates in that\r\nlocality where only a portion of the light proceeding from a luminous\r\nobject can fall; hence an eye in the _penumbra_ would see a part, but\r\nnot the whole of the illuminating body. This shadow also forms a cone,\r\nthe apex of which, if extended, will fall before the opaque body.\r\nIf we receive the shadows so projected at _m_ _n_, for example, on a\r\nwhite sheet, we have in the centre a dark circle, which is the umbra,\r\nsurrounded by the penumbra, which gradually decreases in intensity\r\ntowards the exterior (_see_ fig. 573). The farther we hold the sheet\r\nfrom the body producing the shadow, the umbra decreases, and the\r\npenumbra is enlarged. For where (in solar eclipses) the _umbra_ falls\r\nthere is totality; within the penumbra partial eclipse only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 573.—Lunar eclipse.]\r\n\r\n_Lunar Eclipse._—Let A (fig. 573) be the sun, and B the earth, the\r\nlength of the umbra of the latter will exceed 108 diameters of the\r\nearth. Since the moon is only about thirty terrestrial diameters\r\ndistant from the earth, and as the diameter of the earth’s shadow, at\r\nthis distance, is nearly three times as large as the apparent diameter\r\nof the moon, it follows that when the latter enters this shadow, she\r\nmust be totally eclipsed, for at those places where the moon’s shadow\r\nfalls there is total eclipse. If the moon’s orbit were coincident with\r\nthe ecliptic, or if both moon and earth moved round the sun in the same\r\nplane, there would be an eclipse at every conjunction, and at every\r\nopposition,—_i.e._, a solar eclipse would happen at every new moon, and\r\na lunar eclipse at every full moon. But we have seen that the lunar\r\norbit cuts the ecliptic only in two points; consequently an eclipse of\r\nthe moon is possible only when, at the time of opposition, the moon is\r\nin one of her nodes, or in close proximity to it, which can only occur\r\ntwenty-nine times in the space of eighteen years.\r\n\r\nA lunar eclipse begins on the eastern margin of the moon, and is either\r\n_total_, when her whole disc enters the umbra, or _partial_, when only\r\npart of her disc is in the shadow. A total eclipse may last for two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWe shall understand this better, perhaps, with the diagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 574.—Solar eclipse.]\r\n\r\n_Solar Eclipses._—When the moon and the sun are in conjunction, the\r\nmoon’s place may be represented by M (fig. 574) between the earth,\r\nT, and the sun, S. If this conjunction occur when the moon is in one\r\nof her nodes, or within 16° of it, the shadow of the moon will fall\r\nupon the earth, and the sun will be eclipsed. At other places the sun\r\nwill not be entirely covered; and if the moon be moved farther off, so\r\nthat its shadow will not reach the earth, and so not cover the sun up\r\ncompletely, we shall have an annular eclipse, because a rim of the sun\r\nwill be visible.\r\n\r\nThe lunar umbra extends from the moon by a space about equal to her\r\ndistance from the earth, and hence only a small portion, _d_, of the\r\nearth’s surface enters the lunar umbra. To the inhabitants of this part\r\nof the earth the sun will be totally eclipsed, and the eclipse will be\r\nannular if only the margin of the sun’s disc remain uneclipsed by the\r\nlunar shadow. This is only possible when the moon is in her apogee, or\r\ngreatest distance from the earth, where her apparent diameter is less\r\nthan that of the sun, which it cannot in general exceed more than 1´\r\n38´´. Hence the duration of a total eclipse of the sun cannot be more\r\nthan 3¼ minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the penumbra of the moon is diffused over a much\r\nlarger portion, _n_ _m_, of the surface of the earth, since its section\r\nis five-ninths of the earth’s diameter. The inhabitants of this\r\nportion of the earth do not receive light from all parts of the sun,\r\nconsequently a _part_ of this luminary is invisible to them, and the\r\neclipse is said to be _partial_.\r\n\r\nSolar eclipses commence on the western margin of the sun, and advance\r\nto the eastern. On account of the proximity of the moon to us, an\r\neclipse of the sun is, in all places above the horizon of which the sun\r\nappears, visible neither at the same time, nor is it of equal duration,\r\nnor of equal extent: in some parts it may not be visible at all. In\r\nfavourable situations, the diameter of the umbra, where it reaches\r\nthe earth, amounts to about 167 miles, and on this small strip of the\r\nearth’s surface only can the sun appear totally eclipsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 575.—Lord Rosse’s monster telescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS AND ASTEROIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY.\r\n\r\nIncluding our own globe there are eight principal planets—viz.,\r\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The two\r\nfirst-named being between us and the sun, are termed _interior_\r\nplanets; the others are _exterior_. Mercury, Venus, and Mars are\r\nsmaller than Earth. The other four are much larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 576.—An Orrery.]\r\n\r\nWe have already described the planets as bodies wandering through the\r\nzodiac, and reflecting the sun’s light. Their orbits are very different\r\nfrom the moon’s; for instance, planets take a retrograde motion as\r\nwell as a direct one. The sun and the planets revolving around him\r\nconstitute the solar system.\r\n\r\nWe will commence our brief consideration of them with Mercury, the\r\nplanet nearest to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe distance of Mercury from the sun is 35,000,000 of miles, less than\r\nhalf the distance our earth is from him, and so receives much more\r\nheat and light than we do. The sun to the Mercurians, if there be any\r\ninhabitants upon the planet, must appear about seven times larger than\r\nhe does to us. Mercury’s year is about eighty-five days in length,\r\nso the seasons must be shorter if they follow the same rotation as\r\nours. It passes through space with an exceedingly rapid motion, and so\r\nprobably the ancients called the swift planet Mercury after the winged\r\nmessenger of Jove.\r\n\r\nMercury is not an easy planet to observe, owing to its proximity to the\r\nsun, yet the ancients managed to descry it. But it can be seen just\r\nbefore sunrise and sunset in autumn, and in spring if the weather be\r\nclear. It possesses phases similar to our moon. Some authorities have\r\nstated that Mercury has an atmosphere, but this circumstance, as well\r\nas its formation, is still shrouded in mystery. Mercury’s day is a few\r\nminutes longer than ours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 577.—Transit of Mercury.]\r\n\r\nA transit of Mercury is represented in the accompanying illustration\r\n(fig. 577). This phenomenon took place in 1845, but there have been\r\nmany others noticed. The first recorded took place in November 1631,\r\nand these transits always occur in May or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS.\r\n\r\nVenus is the planet next in order, and revolves about 66,000,000\r\nof miles from the sun. It is the nearest planet to the earth, and\r\nis somewhat smaller than the latter. This planet is both a morning\r\nand evening star, and is very brilliant—so much so, that any close\r\nobservation with the telescope is not possible; and when at her nearest\r\npoint she is invisible as she passes between us and the sun, and of\r\ncourse when fully illuminated she is directly beyond the sun, and\r\nenclosed in his rays. But under other circumstances she is distinctly\r\nvisible as a crescent in the evening, and nearly full as a morning\r\nstar. Venus goes round the sun in 224 days, and her day is rather less\r\nthan ours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 578.—Orbit of Venus.]\r\n\r\nVenus has long been celebrated as the morning and evening star, as\r\n“Lucifer” and “Hesperus.” “Lucifer, son of the morning,” is mentioned\r\nby Isaiah. That Venus possesses an atmosphere denser than our own\r\ncan scarcely be doubted. The observations made during the successive\r\ntransits, particularly the last (1874), seem to have established the\r\nfact that aqueous vapour exists around, and water in, Venus. No\r\nsatellite can be found, though the ancients reported such an attendant\r\nupon this planet.\r\n\r\nThe apparent diameter of Venus varies considerably in consequence of\r\nher varying distances at the inferior and superior conjunction. When\r\nnearest the earth, if she presented her fully illuminated disc to our\r\ngaze, we should see a miniature moon, and even under the circumstances\r\nVenus throws a shadow, so brilliant is her light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 579.—Venus, at quadrature.]\r\n\r\nThe transits of Venus have been referred to, and, like those of\r\nMercury, are simply a passing, or “transit,” of the planet across the\r\nilluminated disc of the sun. The transits afford means to ascertain\r\nthe volume and distance, etc., of the sun, and this year (1882) the\r\nnext transit is expected. There will not be another for more than one\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 580.—Venus, near inferior conjunction.]\r\n\r\nWhether Venus has a constitution similar to our globe is of course\r\ndoubtful. The matter is less dense than the earth, and there is an\r\natmosphere half as dense again as ours. Spots have been noticed\r\ncrossing the planet, which may have been vapours or clouds, and the\r\nrotation of Venus on its axis was calculated from these spots as being\r\n23^h 21^m 22^s. The seasons in Venus must be very different from ours,\r\nas her inclination is greater than our earth, and as the sun is so much\r\nnearer to her than to us her tropical and polar regions are close, and\r\na vertical sun is scarcely enjoyed by two places for three successive\r\ndays, and she may have two winters and summers, two springs and autumns!\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS.\r\n\r\nHaving already considered the earth, we pass on from Venus to Mars. The\r\norbit of the latter planet is exterior to the earth’s, as is proved by\r\nhis never appearing “horned,” nor ever passing across the sun’s disc.\r\nTherefore no “transits” of Mars can take place as transits of Venus and\r\nMercury.\r\n\r\nYet Mars is most favourably situated for astronomical observation by\r\nus, because it turns its full disc to us. Venus is nearer to us than\r\nMars—but, as we have explained, when she comes nearest to us she is\r\nquite invisible. Astronomers have been enabled to ascertain a good deal\r\nconcerning the planet of war—“the red planet Mars.”\r\n\r\nMars has been considered very like the earth. We perceive seas and\r\ncontinents, and the shape of Mars is like the earth. But our globe is\r\nlarger than Mars, which is much less dense, so the force of gravitation\r\nis less also. Mars moves upon his axis in about twenty-four hours\r\nand a half, and takes rather more than 686 days to revolve round the\r\nsun. (_See_ page 489.) Thus its days are a little longer than, and its\r\nyears twice as long as our days and years. When in “opposition,” or on\r\nthe opposite side of us from the sun, Mars is at his brightest. This\r\nhappened in September 1877. He will come close again to us in 1892.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 581.—Mars seen from the earth.]\r\n\r\nAll planets are wanderers, but of all the wanderers Mars has the most\r\neccentric orbit. He curls about, so to speak, in loops and curves in\r\na very irregular manner, and therefore his distance from the earth\r\nvaries very considerably; and this eccentric behaviour of the warlike\r\nplanet must have, as we believe it did, puzzled the ancients very\r\nmuch. But—and here reason came to human aid—this very fact, this great\r\neccentricity of the planetary motions, caused Copernicus to investigate\r\nthe subject with great attention, and he at length explained the true\r\nreason of these irregular orbits from the hypothesis that it was around\r\nthe sun, and not around the earth that the planets moved in regular\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nIt is quite ascertained that Mars is very like our earth in miniature.\r\nWe annex a diagram of the planet, and when it is examined with a good\r\ntelescope the seas and continents can be quite distinctly perceived.\r\nAt the poles there appears to be a white or snowy region at varying\r\nperiods, which would lead us to the conclusion that the atmospheric\r\nchanges and the seasons are similar to our own; and as the inclination\r\nof the planet is nearly the same as the earth, this supposition may be\r\naccepted as a fact.\r\n\r\nThus we see that Mars is the most like earth of all the planets, and\r\nits inhabitants—if, indeed, it is now inhabited—must have a beautiful\r\nview of us when the weather is fine, for we are so much larger. Mars is\r\nalso attended by two satellites, or moons, as Professor Hall reported\r\nfrom Washington in 1877. These moons have been named _Deimos_ and\r\n_Phobos_, and are both very small, their diameter being only about six\r\nmiles; but late astronomers have reasoned that they must be three times\r\nthis diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 582.—Earth seen from Mars.]\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous theories concerning Mars being inhabited, and\r\nof course these suggestions made respecting life on one planet may,\r\nwith varying circumstances, be applied to another. Each planet may\r\nhave had, or may yet have, to pass through what has been termed a\r\n“life-bearing stage.” We on earth are at present in the enjoyment of\r\nthat stage. So far as we can tell, therefore, Mars may be inhabited\r\nnow, as he bears much the same appearance as our planet. Certain\r\nchanges are going on in Mars, and all planets, just as they go on here\r\nin our earth, and as they did long, long ages before the earth was\r\npopulated, and which will continue to go on after life on the earth has\r\nceased to exist.\r\n\r\nMars is, as we know, much further away from the sun than earth is, and\r\nmust receive less direct heat. When he was created, or formed, we can\r\nonly conjecture, but in all probability he cooled before the earth did,\r\nas he is smaller. Here another theory concerning the state of Mars\r\narises, and in support of it we may quote an American authority upon\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\n“His mass is not much more than one-ninth of the earth’s, while his\r\nsurface is about one-third of hers. Then, if originally formed of\r\nthe same temperature, he had only one-ninth her amount of heat to\r\ndistribute. If he had radiated it away at one-ninth of her rate, his\r\nsupply would have lasted as long, but radiation takes place from the\r\nsurface in proportion to the surface, hence he parted with it three\r\ntimes as fast as he should have done to cool at the same rate as the\r\nearth, and must have attained a condition which she will not attain\r\nuntil three times as long an interval has elapsed from the era of her\r\nfirst existence than has already elapsed. Geologists agree that the\r\nlast-named period must be measured by many millions of years; hence it\r\nfollows that twice as many millions of years must elapse before our\r\nearth will be in the same condition as Mars, and Mars must be three\r\ntimes as far on the way toward planetary decrepitude and death as\r\nour earth. Then assigning two hundred thousand years as the extreme\r\nduration of the period during which men capable of studying the\r\nproblems of the universe have existed, and will exist on this earth,\r\nthe theory holds that Mars would have entered on that stage of his\r\nexistence many millions of years ago, and that the appearance of the\r\nplanet itself implies a much later stage of planetary existence.”\r\n\r\nMars is a very interesting study, and the reddish hue which is so\r\ndistinctive is perceived in certain spots when examined by the\r\ntelescope’s aid. These red places were discovered by Cassini. Mr. Dawes\r\nmade drawings of Mars, and Mr. Proctor has by their aid constructed a\r\nregular map of Mars, and a chart of the surface of the planet. There\r\nis much more land than water on Mars, as the bright surfaces which\r\nindicate land are much more extensive than the darker portions which\r\nbetoken the existence of water. But these “markings” are not always\r\nvisible, in consequence of something coming between us and the land on\r\nMars, and this has been attributed to the production of vegetation,\r\nwhich a French _savant_ declared was ruddy-coloured, and that this\r\nautumnal tint departed in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe seasons of Mars are not equal, in consequence of his wandering\r\npropensities, and winter is warmer up there than our winter, while\r\nsummer is cooler than our summer. That there are clouds and an aqueous\r\natmosphere surrounding Mars we learn from spectroscopic observation\r\nand analysis, and in fine we may look upon Mars as similar to our\r\nearth. Respecting the question of its habitation we take the liberty to\r\nquote Mr. Richard Proctor:—\r\n\r\n“I fear my own conclusion about Mars is that his present condition is\r\nvery desolate. I look on the ruddiness of tint to which I have referred\r\nas one of the signs that the planet of war has long since passed its\r\nprime. There are lands and seas in Mars, the vapour of water is present\r\nin his air, clouds form, rains and snows fall upon his surface, and\r\ndoubtless brooks and rivers irrigate his soil, and carry down the\r\nmoisture collected on his wide continents to the seas whence the clouds\r\nhad originally been formed. But I do not think there is much vegetation\r\non Mars, or that many living creatures of the higher types of Martian\r\nlife as it once existed still remain. All that is known about the\r\nplanet tends to show that the time when it attained that stage of\r\nplanetary existence through which our earth is now passing must be\r\nset millions of years, perhaps hundreds of millions of years ago. He\r\nhas not yet, indeed, reached that airless and waterless condition,\r\nthat extremity of internal cold, or in fact that utter unfitness to\r\nsupport any kind of life, which would seem to prevail in the moon. The\r\nplanet of war in some respects resembles a desolate battle-field, and\r\nI fancy that there is not a single region of the earth now inhabited\r\nby man which is not infinitely more comfortable as an abode of life\r\nthan the most favoured regions of Mars at the present time would be for\r\ncreatures like ourselves.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 583.—CHART OF MARS (Names according to Proctor and\r\nGreen).\r\n\r\n  A Peer Continent.\r\n  B Herschel Continent.\r\n  C Fontana Land.\r\n  D Secchi Continent, East.\r\n  E Secchi Continent, Central.\r\n  F Secchi Continent, West.\r\n  G Mädler Continent.\r\n  H Leverrier Land.\r\n\r\n  1 Herschel Strait.\r\n  2 Dawes Ocean.\r\n  3 Maraldi Sea.\r\n  4 Oudemans Sea.\r\n  5 Trouvelot Bay.\r\n  6 Funchal Bay.\r\n  7 Campani Sea.\r\n  8 De la Rue Ocean.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOONS OF MARS.\r\n\r\nWe must devote a few lines to the satellites of Mars, which during\r\nthe last four years have proved a very interesting study for the\r\nastronomers, and some very interesting facts have been ascertained\r\nconcerning the ruddy planet, which is now proved not to be “moonless\r\nMars,” as the poet declared.\r\n\r\nThere are two satellites, which, in consequence of their distance\r\nfrom him, being so different, vary in apparent size. The outer one is\r\ntwelve thousand, the inner one about three thousand five hundred miles\r\nfrom the planet, so the former would revolve in about thirty hours in\r\na direction from west to east, and the inner moon goes round in the\r\nsame way in about seven hours and a half. Mars revolves in twenty-four\r\nand a half hours from west to east. So the outer moon rises for him in\r\nthe east, and the inner one in the west. This is accounted for by the\r\nfact that one travelling slower than Mars rises in the east, the other\r\noutruns him, and comes up in the west.\r\n\r\nBut if we suppose ourselves upon Mars we shall find that, after all,\r\nwe have only one moon properly so called. The outer satellite is very\r\nsmall and very far away, so it is useless to give light—at most, it\r\nis no bigger than Mars appears to us on earth. So the Martians do not\r\nsee two moons passing each other in the sky—that is, unless their eyes\r\nare of greater range and power than ours. Thus they have one moon\r\nrising in the west, appearing in all its phases _every night_, while\r\nour moon takes twenty-eight days to pass through her phases; for we\r\nmust remember that Mars’ moon takes only seven hours and forty minutes\r\nto pass through its orbit, and therefore each quarter will not occupy\r\nquite two hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR PLANETS, OR ASTEROIDS.\r\n\r\nPassing onward from Mars towards Jupiter we arrive at a number of\r\nsmaller planets, which will not concern us very much, as they are\r\nvery small and scarcely visible without a good telescope. But a very\r\ninteresting chapter in the history of astronomy was commenced when the\r\ndiscovery of these bodies was begun. In old times astronomers noticed\r\na very considerable gap between Mars and Jupiter, which was remarkable\r\nwhen the regular progression of the distances between the planets\r\nwas remembered. So Kepler was of opinion that some planet would be\r\ndiscovered having its orbit in that space between Mars and Jupiter. It\r\nis, however, to Piazzi, the Italian, that the discovery of the zone of\r\nasteroids is due.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dec. 8th. Dec. 9th.\r\n\r\nFig. 584.—Field of view showing motion of minor planets amongst the\r\nstars.]\r\n\r\nPiazzi was surveying the constellation Taurus, where he fancied he had\r\ndiscovered a change of place in a star which he had observed on the\r\n1st of January in that year (1801). He was quite sure of this change\r\nnext day (the 3rd of January), and he expressed his opinion to Bode and\r\nOriani. But letters took a long time to pass in those days, and when\r\nthe other astronomers had received the advices the new star had been\r\nlost in the sun’s glory. But after a year, on the 31st December, 1801,\r\nthe planet was again seen and the discovery was proved. The new planet\r\nwas named CERES.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Ceres led to other discoveries. For, while searching\r\nfor her, Olbers found other minor planets, and so on to the present\r\nday. Now we have nearly two hundred asteroids, and more are probably to\r\nbe found in the zone beyond Mars.\r\n\r\nIt would answer no purpose to give a list of the asteroids. We need\r\nonly remark that the first four were discovered in quick succession,\r\nand then a lapse of thirty-eight years occurred before the fifth was\r\nfound, thus—\r\n\r\n  CERES, discovered by Piazzi at Palermo, January 1st, 1801.\r\n  PALLAS,    “         Olbers at Bremen, March 28th, 1802.\r\n  JUNO,      “         Harding at Lillienthal, September 2nd, 1804.\r\n  VESTA,     “         Olbers at Bremen, March 20th, 1807.\r\n  ASTRÆA,    “         Hencke at Driessen, December 8th, 1845.\r\n\r\nSince 1848 there have been numerous minor planets discovered every year.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that all these asteroids are fragments of one large\r\nplanet which has been destroyed was started by Olbers; and in\r\nconfirmation of this view it has been determined that the asteroids\r\nhave essentially the same character. The orbits of these minor planets\r\nare different from the larger “wanderers,” and cross each other, as\r\nwill be seen from the accompanying diagram, so that a collision may one\r\nday ensue.\r\n\r\nPlanetoids and extra zodiacal planets are titles which have been\r\nbestowed upon these bodies, of which VESTA is the first in order in the\r\nsystem, and revolves in 1,325 days, at a mean distance of 225,000,000\r\nof miles from the sun. JUNO and CERES take each about four of our years\r\nto revolve in their orbits, at greater distances still, averaging\r\n260,000,000 of miles. Pallas and Ceres are most alike in their periods\r\nand distance from the sun; the principal asteroids are only about 300\r\nmiles in diameter, while the smaller are very tiny indeed, and one\r\ncertainly has quite disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 585.—Orbit of asteroids.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER, THE GIANT.\r\n\r\nJupiter has been well named the Giant planet, since his diameter is\r\neleven times greater, and he is thirteen hundred times larger than our\r\nplanet. His inclination is very small, and you now know that under such\r\ncircumstances he enjoys very small changes of seasons. Jupiter has four\r\nmoons, or satellites, and an illustration of the “Jovian System” is\r\nherewith given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 586.—The Jovian System.]\r\n\r\nJupiter himself was well known to the ancients, but Galileo was the\r\ndiscoverer of the “moons.” His telescope was, of course, a very\r\nimperfect instrument, and while he was gazing at the planet he noticed\r\nthree stars close by the bright disc, two on one side, but next day\r\nGalileo perceived them all at the same side. Next time he looked there\r\nwere only two, and after many anxious observations he found out, not\r\nonly that Jupiter had three attendant stars, but four!\r\n\r\nThese moons were found to revolve round Jupiter in times varying from\r\nnearly two days to nearly sixteen days, according as they were at a\r\nless or greater distance from him. They were found to have their times\r\nof eclipses and transits, etc., also. These moons act with respect to\r\nJupiter very much as the inner planets act with respect to the sun, for\r\nobservation showed Galileo that the satellites sometimes appeared on\r\none side of the planet, and at other times on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nFrom the diagram of the Jovian System we shall understand the orbits\r\nof the moons, which are all of nearly equal size,—two thousand miles\r\nin diameter,—and cause eclipses of the sun to Jupiter. If the earth\r\nbe in the same direction as the sun the moons are lost to view. The\r\nsatellites disappear into the shadow, and are eclipsed at 1′″, 2′″,\r\n3′″, 4′″, respectively, but they do not always come into view again\r\nimmediately they have passed through the planet’s shadow, because the\r\nearth is a little at one side of the sun. So when the satellite gets\r\nbehind the edge of Jupiter, his shadow being on the opposite side to\r\nthe satellite’s, it is said that the “moon” is in “occultation”; when\r\nit disappears in the shadow it is “eclipsed.” Cassini discovered the\r\n“transit” of Jupiter’s moons. The annexed diagram illustrates the\r\neclipses, etc., very clearly. At the four points, A B C D, we have the\r\nearth; J is Jupiter with his moons; 1 2 3 4 is their orbits. At _a_\r\nmoon No. 1 enters his shadow, and emerges at _b_. From the earth at D\r\n_a_ will be visible, but not _b_, because Jupiter is in the way. So at\r\nB, the coming out, or _emersion_, will be visible, but not the entrance\r\ninto the shadow, or _immersion_. At A the satellite is in transit _d_,\r\non the disc of the planet, J.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 587.—Satellite in Transit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 588.—Eclipses of Jupiter’s Moons.]\r\n\r\nFrom the observation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons the rate of\r\nthe transmission of light was discovered by Roëmer in 1675, and its\r\nprogressive motion was calculated. The eclipses were noticed to take\r\nplace later than the calculated time, when the planet was approaching\r\nconjunction. Roëmer suggested that the delay was owing to the greater\r\ndistance the light had to travel—a distance equal to the diameter of\r\nthe earth’s orbit, or about 190,000,000 of miles. The time was about\r\nsixteen minutes. Light was found to travel at the rate of nearly\r\n12,000,000 of miles a minute.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to picture Jupiter himself. Here we have an\r\nillustration of the planet. He is the biggest, and the brightest,\r\nexcept Venus, of all the planets. He revolves at a distance of\r\n476,000,000 of miles from the sun, and his year is equal to nearly\r\ntwelve of ours, while his day is scarcely ten hours long, showing\r\na rapidity more than twenty times the rate of our earth. Jupiter,\r\ntherefore, must have a very much greater diameter than the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is much less sunlight and heat found on Jupiter than upon Earth,\r\nbecause he is so much farther from the sun than we are, but at the same\r\ntime the heat comes at less intervals than with us. And here the theory\r\nalready noticed respecting the gradual cooling of the planets will be\r\nremembered. Jupiter, we can easily imagine, would take much longer to\r\nget cool than Mars or the earth, and, though his rapid rotation would\r\nassist him, he must be still in the midst of a glowing atmosphere\r\nwithout form and void—perhaps a furnace for cloud and vapour generation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 589.—Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nNow when Jupiter is examined with the telescope it will be seen that\r\nhe is crossed by belts of vapour (_see_ also page 489); and when we\r\nconsider the results of the spectrum analysis of the planet, we may\r\nfairly assume that Jupiter is in a very heated state, and that we\r\ncannot really perceive the actual body of the planet at all yet. There\r\nis an immense quantity of water thus surrounding Jupiter, and he is\r\nstill in the condition in which our earth was before geology grasps\r\nits state, and long ere vegetation or life appeared. The waters have\r\nyet to be “gathered together into one place,” and the dry land has yet\r\nto appear upon Jupiter, who is a very juvenile, if a very enormous\r\nplanet. Under these conditions we can safely assume that there are no\r\ninhabitants of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe belts, or zones, of Jupiter vary in hue, and the continual\r\nchanges which are taking place in this cloud region tend to show that\r\ndisturbances of great magnitude and importance are occurring.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to speculate upon what will happen in Jupiter when the\r\ndisc is eventually cooled. The planet, we know, has not nearly reached\r\nmaturity; the earth is in the full prime of its life, and the moon is\r\ndead and deserted. What the millions of years which must elapse before\r\nJupiter has cooled may bring forth we need not try to find out. The\r\nearth will then, in all probability, be as dreary as the moon is now,\r\nand we shall have returned to dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most curious of all the planets—Saturn, which is\r\nan immense globe surrounded by a beautiful bright ring, or rather\r\nseries of rings, and attended by eight moons. He appears to possess\r\nmuch the same constitution as Jupiter, but enveloped in an even denser\r\natmosphere than the latter. Saturn’s diameter is about nine times\r\ngreater than the earth; he revolves on an inclined axis in about ten\r\nhours, and has seasonal alternations of unequal length. His year is\r\nabout thirty of ours (10,759 days). The most striking phenomena in\r\nconnection with Saturn are his _rings_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 590.—Saturn.]\r\n\r\nSaturn’s rings are supposed to be a close agglomeration of stars, or\r\nsatellites, revolving around the planet and encircling him in a belt.\r\nThe rings are apparently broad and flat and thin, resembling roughly\r\nthe horizon of a globe.\r\n\r\nThe globe of the planet is not exactly in the centre of the rings,\r\nwhich have been measured, and are approximately as below:—\r\n\r\n  Diameter of exterior ring                   169,000 miles.\r\n  Diameter of interior ring                   124,000  “\r\n  Diameter of innermost ring                  100,000  “\r\n  Interval between innermost ring and Saturn   19,000  “\r\n  Intervals between the rings                  18,000  “\r\n  Thickness of the rings                          130  “\r\n  Breadth of the rings                         37,000  “\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 591.—Saturn’s rings at Equinox.]\r\n\r\nThe rings were first recognised as such by Huyghens in 1659, but\r\nGalileo had remarked the curious appearance the planet presented.\r\nCassini confirmed Huyghens’ discovery, and found that the ring was\r\nduplicated, and Mr. Ball made the same discovery. The two outermost\r\nrings are very bright, the inner ring being darker and partially\r\ntransparent, for the ball of Saturn can be perceived through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 592.—Enlarging ring.]\r\n\r\nBut the rings are not always so plainly seen as in the foregoing\r\ndiagram. Sometimes they appear as a mere line of light on each side\r\nof the planet, as shown in the margin. This occurs at the time of the\r\nequinox (fig. 591). By degrees, however, as they become inclined, they\r\nappear broader (fig. 592). The inner ring may be formed of vapour, but\r\nthe outer ones are of something more solid, as the shadows they cast\r\nupon the planet, and it casts upon them, at certain times (figs. 593\r\nand 594).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 593.—Ring shadow.]\r\n\r\nSaturn possesses eight moons, seven of them revolving in orbits on the\r\nplane of the rings, but one is more inclined. These eight satellites\r\nhave been named as follows:—\r\n\r\n  +-------------+-------------------------+-------------+-----------------+\r\n  |   Name.     | Distance from Saturn in |  Time of    |   Discoverer.   |\r\n  |             | radii of Saturn.

They vary much in size, Titan being the largest,\r\nand perhaps equal to Mars, Iapetus being next in magnitude. The\r\nlight of these satellites and the rings is no doubt very great in\r\nthe aggregate, and must have a magnificent appearance in the heavens\r\n(compare page 493). Very likely there are other attendants upon\r\nSaturn, but owing to the brilliancy of the rings it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 594.—Ring shadow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nURANUS.\r\n\r\nUranus was discovered by Herschel in 1781, and has been called after\r\nits discoverer, and sometimes the “Georgium Sidus.” It revolves at an\r\nenormous distance from the sun—viz., 1,753,000,000 of miles. It takes\r\nabout eighty-four of our years (30,686 days) to go round the sun, and\r\npossesses four moons. It is very much larger than the earth—about four\r\ntimes the diameter, and forty times its volume. We can only speculate\r\nconcerning its physical constitution, which is assumed to be similar\r\nto that of Jupiter, while the changes of temperature and seasons must\r\nvary immensely. The names of the moons are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and\r\nOberon. The outer pair can be seen without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this planet was determined by calculation before it\r\nhad been seen at all. Uranus was observed to be disturbed in his orbit,\r\nmoving sometimes faster than at others; and even before Uranus had been\r\ndiscovered Saturn and Jupiter had been seen to be affected by some\r\nbody in the system. M. Leverrier determined to ascertain the cause of\r\nthis, and came to the conclusion that some other planet was influencing\r\nUranus. The Newtonian theory here received a most convincing proof.\r\nWhile Leverrier was calculating, Mr Adams of Cambridge leaped to the\r\nsame conclusion, and wrote the result of his calculations to Professor\r\nAiry, and the planet was seen, but not reported upon. Meantime\r\nLeverrier published his calculations, and the observers at Berlin\r\ndetected the new planet in September 1846.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 595.—Neptune in field of view with stars of 6th,\r\n7th, 8th, and 9th magnitudes.]\r\n\r\nVery little can be said concerning Neptune, as its distance is too\r\ngreat for observation. It is at 2,746,000,000 of miles from the sun,\r\nand takes 164 years to go round it (60,126 days). It is about the same\r\nsize as Uranus. It has one moon, which moves round the planet in 5^d\r\n21^h, and is of great size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE FIXED STARS.\r\n\r\n FIXED STARS—MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS—CONSTELLATIONS—DESCRIPTIONS OF THE\r\n ZODIACAL CONSTELLATIONS—NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STAR GROUPS—DISTANCE OF\r\n STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been considering the planets so far as they are known to\r\nastronomers, but no doubt we shall find out others some day beyond\r\nNeptune in space, for it must be assumed that there are other planets\r\nwandering about in the infinite firmament. At present, however, we\r\ncannot spare time for such speculation; we have got to peep at the\r\nstars and their groupings.\r\n\r\n“What little bits of things the stars are,” a child said once in our\r\nhearing; and there were others present who were inclined to believe\r\nthat the tiny light spots we could see looked small—not because they\r\nwere distant, but because they were of no great magnitude; and when\r\nthose children were told that the tiny stars were “suns” like our sun,\r\ngiving heat and light millions and millions of miles away,—and, so far\r\nas we can tell, some are much bigger and hotter than our own sun,—they\r\nwere very much surprised indeed, and one little girl aptly quoted Dr.\r\nWatts:—\r\n\r\n    “Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\r\n    How I wonder what you are”!\r\n\r\nNow let us endeavour to learn something about these apparently tiny\r\nspecks, and why they “twinkle.”\r\n\r\nAt a very early period in the history of astronomy the observers\r\nof the heavens grouped stars together in fancied resemblances to\r\nmen or animals; and these “constellations,” as they are termed, are\r\ncombinations of _fixed stars_—that is, of stars which do not wander\r\nabout as the planets do. But these so-called fixed stars have motions;\r\nthey are only relatively fixed with reference to their positions to\r\neach other as they appear to revolve daily round the earth. But stars\r\nhave a movement of their own, which is termed their “proper motion.”\r\n\r\nIt is to Halley that the discovery of these real star motions is due.\r\nHe saw three very bright stars (Sirius, Aldebaran, and Arcturus) were\r\nnot in the places they had been assigned. The sun also has been found\r\nto possess a “proper motion,” and, with the planets, is travelling\r\nas determined by Sir J. Herschel, to a particular place in the\r\nconstellation called Hercules. There are now star catalogues and star\r\nmaps, for the heavens have been as closely surveyed as the earth,\r\nand by accurate observations it has now become possible to find the\r\nposition of every star usually visible. Some of the stars are used as\r\n“clock” stars, by which sidereal time can be calculated accurately, and\r\nthe clocks thereby corrected. The stars, though termed “fixed,” are in\r\nperpetual movement—Arcturus at the rate of fifty miles a second, and\r\nothers less. Only the rates of a few are known.\r\n\r\nThe number of the stars is beyond our calculation, and even the\r\nnumber of stars only visible in the telescope amount to millions, and\r\nthese are called telescopic stars. The visible stars amount to about\r\nsix thousand, and of course these are the brightest up to the sixth\r\nmagnitude. There are more visible in the southern than in the northern\r\nhemisphere. The magnitudes of the stars range in classes according to\r\nthe brightness of the stars observed, for this is really the test from\r\nthe first magnitude to the sixth; after that the telescopic stars are\r\nseen up to the fifteenth or sixteenth. We can only see about three\r\nthousand stars at any one time from any place, although, as remarked\r\nabove, many millions may be observed with a good telescope, and as many\r\nmore, probably twenty millions, are invisible.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to detail the constellations, which are familiar\r\nby name to everybody. We have already given the names of the zodiacal\r\ngroups, which consist of many stars, each designated by a letter of the\r\nGreek alphabet so far as possible, then the Roman letters and numerals\r\nare employed. Thus α (Alpha) is the most brilliant star; β (Beta) the\r\nnext bright γ (Gamma) the next, and so on; so the relative brilliancy\r\nof the stars in the constellation is indicated, but not the very\r\nbiggest star of the first magnitude is intended by α, for the star δ in\r\none constellation may equal α in another. John Bayer originated this\r\nmethod in 1603.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the constellations is plunged in the obscurity\r\nof ages, but B.C. 370 there were forty-five thus grouped. There are\r\nnorthern and southern constellations which are visible above our old\r\nfriends Aries, Taurus, Cancer, etc. We will, as in duty bound, consider\r\nour old acquaintances first, and then give a list of the northern and\r\nsouthern groups of stars; but we shall find that the forms are in the\r\ngreater part due to the imagination of the ancients, and do not bear\r\nout our ideas of the animals they are supposed to represent, while at\r\nthe same time they cross and recross with other constellations in the\r\nskies in a very puzzling way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 596.—Aries.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first constellation is ARIES, the Ram, which is celebrated in\r\nmythology as the proud possessor of the Golden Fleece, which we may\r\nremember was seized and carried away by Jason and the Argonauts. The\r\nHellespont is so called from Helle, who fell from the Ram’s back when\r\nbeing carried upon it over the Black Sea. The Ram is here represented\r\nwith the equinoctial ring.\r\n\r\nWe perceive in Aries two very bright stars near the head. These are\r\n(α) Arietis and (γ) Sheretan. The signs and constellations do not now\r\ncorrespond as they used to do, because of the change in the position of\r\nthe stars, which gives rise to the Precession of the Equinoxes (_vide\r\nante._, p. 497), so that the stars which two thousand years ago were\r\nin conjunction with the sun, are much more to the eastward. In olden\r\ntime (when astronomy was young), the sun entered Aries on the 21st\r\nMarch, and now a change has taken place. But in about another twenty\r\nthousand years, they will all come right again. This will be perceived\r\nby reference to the celestial globe. The Ram has sixty-six stars in his\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAURUS, the Bull, is the next constellation. He received his name from\r\nthe celebrated animal into which Jupiter transformed himself when he\r\nwished to carry away Europa. The star Aldebaran (α) is the end of a\r\nkind of V in the Bull’s face. The Pleiades are on the shoulder to\r\nthe right. This cluster of twinkling stars is well known, and will\r\nguide the observer towards the imaginary Bull, which we must nowadays\r\ndescribe as rather a fanciful delineation. Europe is called after\r\nEuropa, because Jupiter, as a Bull, carried her to this continent.\r\nThere are 141 stars in Taurus, according to the number found in the\r\nlist of Aratus, and probably more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 597.—Taurus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGEMINI, the Twins, which are supposed to be Castor and Pollux, though\r\nit is believed that two goats were the original sign—which statement,\r\ntaken in connection with the ram and the bull, that were also turned\r\nout in the spring-time, may have something to recommend it. But now\r\nCastor and Pollux are generally recognized as the constellation. During\r\nthe expedition for the Golden Fleece, the electric appearance, now\r\nknown as St. Elmo’s Fire, became visible upon them, and their effigies\r\nwere placed in the forepart of ships as a good omen. This led to the\r\nadoption of the “figure-head.” They were made into stars when Pollux\r\nwas immortalized by Jupiter, for he divided the boon with his brother.\r\nThe planet Uranus was discovered near this constellation, which\r\ncontains eighty-five stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 598.—Gemini.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCER, the Crab, is the next in order, and the only derivation we\r\ncan find for this is that Juno sent a crab to attack Hercules when he\r\nwas busily engaged with the many-headed Hydra. The crab was directed\r\nto pinch the hero’s foot, but it appears rather a lame device for\r\nthe Queen to adopt. The crab, however, was killed by Hercules, and\r\nplaced amongst the stars by Juno as a reward; so he gained immortality\r\ncheaply. He, Cancer, contains more than eighty stars, but none of them\r\nof any particular note. Some writers explain the sign as reminding the\r\nancients of “the retrograde movement of the sun to the north”; but as\r\na crab does not move “backwards,” we will still adhere to mythology\r\nas equally satisfactory at any rate. Cancer, however, was termed the\r\n“northern gate of the sun.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 599.—Cancer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is LEO, the Lion, which came round in summer and at the period\r\nof much heat, so this fierce animal may have been chosen to represent\r\nthat season. But mythology will have us credit the Nemæan Lion sent\r\nagainst Hercules by Juno as the origin of this constellation. The lion\r\nwas, like the crab, placed amongst the stars when he was killed. He is\r\na very brilliant constellation, and a very bright star called Regulus\r\nis to be seen in his chest—“Cor Leonis.” Another very fine star of\r\nthe second magnitude is observable in the tail. The Lion consists of\r\nninety-five stars, the principal ones being of the first and second\r\nmagnitudes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 600.—Leo.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGO is supposed to be outlined by a very rich cluster of stars,\r\nand one of the first magnitude. The Virgin is by some supposed to\r\nbe Astræa, the goddess, but is more likely referable to a girl\r\ngleaning, or holding an ear of corn in semblance of the harvest. This\r\nconstellation contains more than one hundred stars. One of them in the\r\nwheat-ear is a particularly brilliant one, and noted for its “solitary\r\nsplendour,” as no star of large magnitude is near it. The Arabs used to\r\ncall it the Solitary Simak; _Spica Virginis_ is the modern name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 601.—Virgo.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRA, which follows, may either indicate the balance, or scales\r\nof justice, of Astræa, or the equal day and night at the autumnal\r\nequinox. Virgil mentions Astræa’s balance, and thus we have a classical\r\nauthority for the very mythological view of the two foregoing\r\nconstellations. Libra is not very distinct; it contains fifty-one\r\nstars, four of which are very bright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 602.—Libra.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCORPIO, the Scorpion, according to classical writers, encountered\r\nOrion, who is also met with in the stellar universe. The scorpion stung\r\nOrion because he declared there was no living creature he could not\r\novercome by force. On the other hand, this sign may have some reference\r\nto the unhealthy time of year, and the prevalence of disease about the\r\ntime that _Scorpio_ appeared. A beautiful star of reddish hue and of\r\nthe first magnitude is prominent amongst the brilliant assembly of the\r\nScorpion’s forty-four stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 603.—Scorpio.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGITTARIUS, the Archer, is, as one can see, a Centaur, and said to be\r\nChiron, who was wounded by Hercules, and cured by being taken up to\r\nHeaven by Jupiter. This Chiron is represented as a great patron of the\r\narts, and thus the fable may be said to exemplify the proverb, “Art\r\nis long, time is fleeting”; for readers of mythology will find much\r\nmore in the legends than is apparent on the surface. But we can now\r\nonly regard the Centaur from an astronomical, and not a philosophical\r\nstandpoint. Sagittarius has no very brilliant stars. He is close to the\r\nMilky Way, and contains sixty-nine stars, five forming a sort of V in\r\nthe bow, sometimes compared to a ladle or “dipper.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 604.—Sagittarius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 605.—Capricornus.]\r\n\r\nCAPRICORNUS, the Goat, is supposed to be _Pan_—“the great god Pan,” who\r\nturned himself into a goat. The sun was in Capricornus at mid-winter,\r\nso the “southern gate of the sun” was a title bestowed upon him. But\r\nnow the constellation is later. It does not include any very striking\r\nstars, of which there are fifty-one in the “Goat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUARIUS, or the Waterbearer, may have referred to wet weather, or as\r\nothers declare, to Ganymede, the Cupbearer. There are four stars in the\r\nwaterpot like a Y; and more than one hundred stars of small brilliancy\r\nare included in this constellation. But here again fancy must come to\r\nour assistance, for without a diagram the ordinary observer could not\r\ndistinguish the Waterbearer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 607.—Aquarius.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPISCES, the Fishes, are not plainly defined. It is supposed that Venus\r\nand Cupid turned themselves into fish when the Titans assailed Heaven.\r\nThis Constellation occupies a triangle in the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 606.—Pisces.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are the zodiacal constellations, and may be more easily\r\nremembered by repeating an old rhyme, which runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins;\r\n      Then, next the Crab, the Lion shines,\r\n        The Virgin, and the Scales;\r\n    The Scorpion, Archer, and the Goat,\r\n      The Man who holds the Watering Pot,\r\n        The Fish with Glittering tails.”\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the various Constellations at which we have so\r\nrapidly glanced, as well as of those that follow, has been the work of\r\nmany different periods. Aratus and Ptolemy are the oldest enumerators,\r\nbut modern research has added immensely to the store of knowledge.\r\nMany of the most prominent stars were named by Grecian and Arabian\r\nobservers, and many of the names are still retained—such as Arcturus,\r\nRigel, Capella, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS.\r\n\r\nThere are, altogether, thirty-five of these, as per list on next page.\r\nIt is of course impossible to describe them all, but we will make a\r\nfew remarks respecting those which will be distinguished most readily,\r\nand the manner of finding out particular stars. There are star maps\r\npublished, and with a little attention and reading, a great many very\r\npleasant evening excursions may be made across the sky, with or without\r\na telescope. The following is the list of the northern constellations.\r\nWe have put them in various types to indicate the most important.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |                                              |             | NO.

This constellation has\r\nalso been termed the “Dipper,” and is very conspicuous in the northern\r\nhemisphere. The three stars form the bear’s tail, or the handle of the\r\n“plough”; the others form the body, Charles’s Wain, or “Karl-Wagen,”\r\nthe German term for peasant’s cart, is represented by the quadrangle\r\nforming the cart, and the other three stars are the horses.\r\n\r\nThe “Pointers” are the two end stars, and if a line be followed\r\nnorthwards from them it will lead close to _Polaris_, the principal\r\nstar in the lesser bear. This pole star is of a very great brightness,\r\nand peeps out, almost isolated, with a pure lustre. The names of the\r\npointers are Dubhe and Menak. The star at the tail-tip is Benetnasch,\r\nthen Mizar and Alioth. Megrez and Phad are the remaining pair. We\r\nappend a rough outline of the bear, for the information of those who\r\nhave not yet noticed it.\r\n\r\nThe Lesser Bear is not so important as his elder brother as regards\r\nsize, but he is very useful to astronomers. He resembles the Great\r\nBear in appearance, but is smaller, and the positions of the stars\r\nare inverted. In the cut on page 555 (fig. 629) you see the little\r\nbear swinging round the polar star, which is at the tip of the Lesser\r\nBear’s tail, so any one will be enabled to find him if they look for\r\nthe polar star, and then count the three stars away from it, and the\r\nfour in the body. The Great Bear’s tail points in the other direction.\r\nThis movement of the earth’s axis by displacing the equinoctial points,\r\nalters the “declination” and “right ascension” of the stars (compare\r\npage 473). So Polaris is gradually approaching the actual polar point.\r\nIn about 200 years he will have got as close as he can, and will then\r\nbegin to recede from it, and in about 12,500 years after he will reach\r\nhis most distant point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 608.—The Great Bear.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLARIS, the Pole Star, was called “Cynosure” by the ancients, and thus\r\nwe can understand the quotation, “Cynosure of neighbouring eyes,” when\r\na person or object is very attractive. The pole star was the point to\r\nwhich all looked. There are some other very important stars in these\r\nconstellations. For instance, in—\r\n\r\n    Perseus we have Algenib and Algol, of second magnitude.\r\n    Auriga we have Capella, of the first magnitude.\r\n    Boötes we have Arcturus, of the first magnitude.\r\n    Lyra we have Vega, a very large and bright star.\r\n    Aquila, Altair, also a very beautiful star.\r\n    In Cygnus there is Deneb, of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nThese stars are also designated by the Greek letters—α, lyræ, or the\r\nfirst in the Lyre—that is, Vega; and so on for all, according to rank,\r\nas already explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS.\r\n\r\nWe must pass on to the southern constellations, of which there are\r\nforty-six; the principal ones are in capital letters:—\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------+-----------+--------+\r\n  |                                                   |           | NO.

The\r\nformer certainly constitutes the most glorious group, and it is visible\r\nto all the world, because the equinoctial passes through it.\r\n\r\n\r\nORION, as we have said, can be viewed from either hemisphere, and so\r\ncan some others; but those marked with an asterisk in the foregoing\r\nlist are not visible in the latitude of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 609.—Orion.]\r\n\r\nOrion is a very brilliant constellation, and contains two fine stars of\r\nthe first magnitude, and some of the second. The former are Betelgeux\r\nand Rigel. Bellatrix is the third in order. The “belt” is formed of\r\nthree bright stars, and the sword is visible as five stars just below.\r\nCanis Major possesses Sirius, a very fine star (the dog star). Canis\r\nMinor has two of the first and second magnitude, and Hydra has one of\r\nthe first. The Southern Cross is a beautiful constellation, invisible\r\nin our latitude, but familiar to sailors in the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STARS’ DISTANCE AND MAGNITUDE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 610.—Polaris.]\r\n\r\nWhen we gaze up into the sky at night, we see the stars twinkling far\r\naway, and we may remark here that this twinkling of the stars is due\r\nto the atmosphere and the changes in its power of refraction, and of\r\ncourse the star’s light changes its direction. But if we ascend in a\r\nballoon into very high and rarefied strata of the air, we will find\r\nthe twinkling less. We have given the number of the stars according\r\nto Flamstead, but the larger the telescope the greater will be the\r\nnumber of stars we shall see, numbers again being too far even for our\r\nperfected instruments.\r\n\r\nBut we can gain some idea of the magnitude of the stars when we\r\nconsider the distance to arrive at, which is a most difficult task, for\r\nfigures seem scarcely long enough to count the millions of miles, and\r\nno instrument can detect the parallax. Even supposing the parallax to\r\nbe a very small fraction of a degree we should get a result equalling\r\ntrillions of miles. NO. 61 in Cygni was at one time continually\r\nobserved by Professor Bessel, and he found that its distance—and it is\r\nthe nearest star—is _sixty-two and a half trillions of miles_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 611.—The Southern Cross.]\r\n\r\nLet us consider what this means. Light comes to us from the sun\r\n(91,000,000 of miles) in about eight minutes, and travels at the\r\nrate of something like 186,000 miles in a second. But even at that\r\nastounding rate the light from the star called 61 Cygni took ten\r\nyears to reach the earth; and there are stars whose light has never\r\nyet reached the earth, although the gleam may have been travelling at\r\n186,000 miles a second for thousands of years. And we may presume that\r\nthough we still see the light of stars, some of them may be dead, but\r\nthe light left is still progressing to us through space.\r\n\r\nSo we must conclude that some stars which look large, as do Vega and\r\nSirius for instance, must be enormous “suns,” a great deal larger than\r\nour sun, and the stars are each the centre of invisible systems just\r\nas our sun is the centre of the “solar” system. Vega is a tremendous\r\nstar, and shines with her own light as do all other visible stars; for\r\nreflected light, so very visible in the moon, which is close to us,\r\nwould be quite invisible at such tremendous distances. So we must call\r\nthese stars “suns,” and may add an apparently astonishing fact, that\r\nour own sun is merely one of the stars in the Galaxy, or “Milky Way”!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE STARS—(_continued_).\r\n\r\n DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS—COLOURED AND VARIABLE STARS—CLUSTERS,\r\n GROUPS, AND NEBULÆ—THE GALAXY, OR MILKY WAY—HOW TO FIND OUT THE\r\n PRINCIPAL STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough not very clearly visible to the naked eye, there are in the\r\nsky some pairs of stars very close together apparently; but when these\r\ndouble stars are examined with a good telescope we find that though we\r\nfancy they are two stars very close, in reality an immense distance\r\nseparates them. By Vega, which we have already mentioned, there is\r\napparently a star, which on examination will be found really to be\r\ntwo stars. It is also in the constellations of the Lyre, but of much\r\nlower magnitude than Vega. But in some instances there are three or\r\nfour stars thus placed together, and the frequency of the occurrence of\r\nthis fact establishes the farther fact that these combinations are not\r\naccidental—that the stars are interdependent and physically connected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 612.—γ Leonis.]\r\n\r\nThere are now at least six thousand double stars known,[27] and this\r\nis a very small proportion of the forty millions or so of suns which\r\nare believed to exist in space. But of these six thousand a larger\r\nproportion have been ascertained to be physically connected. More than\r\nsix hundred of these pairs are double suns, while again there are other\r\ncombinations of three and perhaps more. When two are thus connected we\r\nhave what are termed binary systems, and when more are associated they\r\nare called triple and multiple stars. An example of the last-mentioned\r\nclass is the small star above mentioned near Vega. It is ε Lyræ, and\r\nis a double of a double. In ordinary telescopes this will not be\r\nperceived, but with a high power the combination will be noticed. The\r\nsame phenomenon is observable in one of the stars of Hercules and in\r\nAndromeda.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of these double suns, or binary systems, has been\r\nclosely observed, and Professor Newcomb has given us a list of the\r\nbinary systems of short period which are well determined. These are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  42 Coronæ              26 years.\r\n  ζ Herculis             35 years.\r\n  Struve 3,121           40 years.\r\n  η Coronæ               40 years.\r\n  Sirius                 50 years.\r\n  ξ Cancri               58 years.\r\n  ξ Ursæ Majoris         63 years.\r\n  η Coronæ Borealis      67 years.\r\n  α Centauri             77 years.\r\n  μ Ophiuchi             92 years.\r\n  λ Ophiuchi             96 years.\r\n  ξ Scorpii              98 years.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that although these double stars appear close\r\ntogether from our standpoint, they may be far apart—one behind the\r\nother in a straight line. When such “pairs” exist they are known as\r\noptical pairs, or optically double stars, as distinguished from the\r\nactually physical “pairs” which revolve round the centre of a system.\r\nIn Orion there has been discovered a regular system, and the θ in\r\nOrion, which appears in a common telescope a moderate star, and to\r\nthe unaided eye only a speck of light, is really composed of seven\r\nstars—four are set in the form of a trapezium, as figured in the\r\ndiagram in the margin by dots and asterisks. Two of these have been\r\nascertained to possess attendants indicated by dots, and a seventh star\r\nwas discovered by Lassell, and Humboldt remarks that in all probability\r\nthis apparently tiny star in the constellation Orion constitutes a real\r\nsystem, for the five smaller stars have the same proper motion as the\r\nprincipal one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 613.—Monocerotis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 614.—Trapezium of Orion (Herschel).]\r\n\r\nThus our imagination almost fails to grasp the infinity of the systems\r\nwith our single sun, and with the distant double and even triple suns\r\nround which planets revolve perfectly independent of the other systems,\r\nas we are independent of them possessing heat and light from their\r\nown sun or suns as we receive it from ours, day and night seasons\r\nsucceeding each other, and the wondrous varieties of the light produced\r\nby the appearance or withdrawal of a sun or two in the firmament of\r\nthose most distant planets. These suns being double or triple would\r\naffect each other; the composition of the light given forth would\r\nproduce—as we may assume—varying effects. We know something about the\r\nlight of the stars by the spectroscope, and the colours of stars are\r\ndue to the vapour which takes away a certain part of the light emitted,\r\nleaving the remainder to descend through the atmosphere to us.\r\n\r\nBinary stars are most numerous of the doubles; for instance Castor, η\r\nCoronæ, Rigel, Polaris, Mivac, γ Leonis, γ Virginis, ξ Ursæ Majoris, α\r\nHercules, 36 Andromedæ, λ Ophiuchi, and π Aquilæ. The illustration in\r\nthe margin is Castor (or α Geminorum), the most northerly of the Twins.\r\nThe η Coronæ is also figured, as are Polaris (_see_ fig. 610 _ante._),\r\nBoötes, Rigel, and γ Leonis.\r\n\r\nThe cuts herewith illustrate the relative positions at the periods\r\nnamed of the “doubles,” and of the revolution of suns around other suns\r\nas mentioned. As a consequence of their proper motion the binary stars\r\nappear to vary in their distances from each other, as in the topmost\r\nof the three cuts on the (opposite) page representing γ Virginis. The\r\nstars have gradually approached each other, and so are the stars in\r\nCastor approximating, and when they have closed, and have appeared\r\nalmost as a single star, as they will do, they will take open order\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 615.—η Coronæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 616.—Boötes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 617.—Castor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 618.—Rigel.]\r\n\r\nThe shortest time occupied by a double star in its revolution is\r\nthirty-five years, and we have already given some of those which\r\nhave been ascertained. We will close this section with a few other\r\nexamples. For instance, γ Virginis revolves in one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, Castor in two hundred and forty years, 4 Aquarii in three\r\nhundred years, 37 Pegasi in five hundred years. There are numerous\r\nother instances up to a period of three thousand years, and about eight\r\nhundred of these binary systems are known. We have mentioned that there\r\nare two or more suns in the multiple systems. These suns are the cause\r\nof the different colours of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\nThe question of star-colour follows naturally the consideration of\r\nthe multiple stars; for although single stars have been observed of a\r\nruddy colour, there are no instances of a blue or green one unattended\r\nby a companion. This colouring has been attributed to the contrast\r\nbetween multiple stars, for the colours are frequently complementary;\r\nbut investigation has shown that this cannot be the case. For instances\r\nhave been known in which, when two are thus associated, and one is\r\nconcealed from us, the other is just as bright, and retains its former\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nOf course in cases in which colour is apparent to the unaided vision,\r\nonly the brightest stars betray colour. Antares, Betelgeuse and\r\nAldebaran are red (orange) colour. Sirius and Canopus are white.\r\nArcturus and Capella are yellowish, so is Pollux. Vega is bluish-white.\r\nThese appearances are, of course, much more marked when the stars are\r\nexamined through the telescope, and telescopic stars—which are stars\r\nunobservable without a glass—are very much coloured, and the multiple\r\nstars give us blue, green, violet, and other tints, besides those\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgain, these coloured stars do not always remain the same colour.\r\nSirius was once red; Mars was at times white. Spectrum analysis shows\r\nthat the colours of many are due to absorption by the vapours of some\r\nof the rays; and the existence of certain vapours may cut off some, and\r\nat other times other vapours may exist and cut off other rays, and so\r\nthe colours may be changed. Struve gives the following list of binary\r\ncomplements of “multiple” stars:—\r\n\r\n  Pairs consisting of a blue and white principal star              53\r\n    “            “           and a light yellow principal star     52\r\n    “            “           a yellow or red principal star        52\r\n    “            “           a green principal star                16\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 619.—Position of the two stars of γ Virginis.*]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 620.—Position of the two stars of Castor.*]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 621.—Position of the two stars of ξ Ursæ Majoris.*]\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely pursue this question farther, though many ideas\r\nconcerning the coloured stars will arise in every thoughtful reader’s\r\nmind. Supposing that every system has its sun or suns, can we fancy\r\nthe effects of a green or blue or violet sunlight—a light unmixed? To\r\nemploy the words of Sir John Herschel—“It may be more easily suggested\r\nin words than conceived in imagination what variety of illumination two\r\nsuns, a red and a green, or a yellow and blue one, must afford to a\r\nplanet circulating round either—or what charming contrasts and graceful\r\nvicissitudes a red and a green day, for instance, alternating with a\r\nwhite one and with darkness, might arise from the presence or absence\r\nof one or other or both above the horizon.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST AND NEW STARS.\r\n\r\nWe may have perhaps read the “Lost Pleiad,” and wondered what has\r\nbecome of the star supposed to have dropped out of the cluster so\r\nwell known in the constellation Taurus—the Pleiades. There are seven\r\nstars, of which six are visible to the average eye, and the ancients\r\nused to declare that one of the seven sisters (the daughters of Atlas\r\nand Pleione) hid herself because she had married a mortal, while all\r\nher sisters wedded gods. It is not improbable that one of the seven,\r\nformerly distinguishable with the unassisted eye, may have disappeared\r\nor been lost; but it is certain that strong eyesight can see more than\r\nseven now, and in the telescope there are about one hundred.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a fact that some stars whose places have been carefully\r\nmarked in the catalogue have subsequently disappeared. Many errors\r\nmay have been made, and stars put down where no star existed, so a\r\nsucceeding observer has not been able to find the star indicated. But,\r\non the other hand, we may admit that stars have been lost to sight, and\r\nto compensate us for any such disappearances new stars are frequently\r\nobserved, and these are very remarkable phenomena. About 121 B.C.\r\nHipparchus perceived a new star, which was visible even in the daytime,\r\nand on subsequent occasions others came into existence—viz., in the\r\nyears 945, 1264, and 1572. In the last-mentioned year Tycho Brahé\r\nsuddenly perceived the new star, which was at first very brilliant.\r\nIt grew fainter and fainter, after first gaining in intensity, and\r\ndisappeared entirely in 1574; and at other times stars have been seen\r\nwhich remained only for a short time, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe star discovered by Tycho Brahé was seen by him when walking across\r\nthe fields one night, and he encountered peasants who were gazing at\r\nthe new luminary. It was so bright that it threw a shadow from Brahé’s\r\nstick. The new arrival appeared in “Cassiopeia,” under the lady’s\r\nchair, forming, as pictured in the diagram, an irregular square. The\r\nstrange star is the largest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 622.—Cassiopeia.]\r\n\r\nSome stars exhibit extraordinary fluctuations, and one discovered\r\nby Mr. Birmingham in 1866, decreased rapidly and sank away to about\r\nthe tenth magnitude, and then got brighter, and again diminished in\r\nsplendour. The “Eta” Argûs has also been subjected to many fluctuations\r\nlikewise, and such alterations have gained for these luminaries the\r\nname of “Variable Stars.”\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying little chart there will be perceived two particular\r\nstars, named Algol, “the demon,” and Mira “the wonderful.” The latter\r\nis the most celebrated for its variable qualities, and its cycle of\r\nchange occupies nearly one of our years. For a few days it appears very\r\nbright, and then fades away for about three months, to disappear for\r\nfive months, and then it reappears again, increasing in brilliancy up\r\nto the second magnitude for another three months or so. Some people\r\naccount for these phenomena by stating that the sides of the star being\r\nless luminous present the dark and light portions in rotation; but we\r\ncan give no satisfactory explanation of the reason, unless it be caused\r\nby an aggregation of spots upon its surface, like sun-spots on our sun,\r\nor perhaps by eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 623.—Star-Map.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 624.—Nebulæ in Pegasus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 625.—Dumb bell Nebulæ.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR-CLUSTERS AND NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\nNEBULÆ and STAR-CLUSTERS are numerous in the heavens. The most\r\nimportant are the Great Nebulæ in Orion and in Andromeda. But there are\r\nother very beautiful “patches” of luminous matter or cloud appearances\r\ncomposed of minute stars invisible to the naked eye. We annex specimens\r\nof the Nebulæ, one or two having been already inserted. There must be\r\nthousands of these star-clouds, and they have been classified by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel from Sir William’s discoveries as follows:—\r\n\r\n (1) Clusters of stars, in which the stars are clearly distinguishable,\r\n divided again into regular and irregular clusters.\r\n\r\n (2) Resolvable Nebulæ, which may be separated into distinct stars\r\n under powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\n (3) Nebulæ, in which there is no appearance whatever of stars, divided\r\n into classes according to brightness, etc.\r\n\r\n (4) Planetary Nebulæ.\r\n\r\n (5) Stellar Nebulæ.\r\n\r\n (6) Nebulous Stars.\r\n\r\nWe learn also from the foregoing authority that Nebulæ affect a certain\r\ndistrict; that is, they have, as it were, a preference for it, and are\r\nnot distributed in a random manner over the heavens, and are found in\r\nLeo, Leo Minor, Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Coma, Böotes, and Virgo,\r\nand more sparingly in Aries, Taurus, Orion, Perseus, Draco, Hercules,\r\nLyra, etc. Nebulæ are found associated with stars, as is the case with\r\nη Argus; these are called nebulous stars, and in the case of this\r\nparticular star many very interesting investigations have been made.\r\nThe Nebulæ are as equally variable as the stars they surround.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 626.—Nebulæ in Perseus.]\r\n\r\nWhat is termed the Nebular Hypothesis was put forward by La Place, and\r\nby it he endeavoured to account for the regular development of the\r\nstellar system, which is supposed to have originated from an immense\r\nnebular cloud. This immense mass would rotate and contract, and the\r\nouter portions would separate and develop in rings like Saturn’s\r\nrings. Then the rings break into separate portions, and each portion\r\ncondenses into a planet, or the small “bits” travel round the sun\r\nlike asteroids, and in this manner various systems were formed. This\r\ntheory was considered to be quite exploded when stars were discerned in\r\nnebulæ by the more recent telescopes; but then the spectroscope came\r\nto our aid, and it was discovered that there were some nebulæ which\r\nare simply masses of glowing gas or aggregations of stones which are\r\ndashing against each other in so forcible a manner as to produce heat\r\nand luminosity. Mr. Lockyer appears to favour the latter theory as to\r\nnebulæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 627.—Nebulæ in Canes Venatici.]\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor, however, has put forward a hypothesis that the star or\r\nmeteor showers are the original cause of the sidereal system, and this\r\nrain of meteors has fallen for all time, gradually consolidating into\r\norbs. The fact that the constituents of sun, earth and planets, comets\r\nand meteors being fundamentally the same lends probability to this\r\nhypothesis, which is fully explained by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy is familiar to all readers, and although visible all the\r\nyear round, is perceived more plainly in August, September, and\r\nOctober, or at the beginning and ending of that period. This zone of\r\nstars was of course well known to the ancients, but it is to Galileo\r\nthat we owe the first important information about the Galaxy; he\r\ndecided that it was formed of stars. Sir John Herschel investigated the\r\nsubject very closely, and to him much of the information concerning the\r\nMilky Way is due.\r\n\r\nIt is not very distinct in the north, but as it advances from Cepheus\r\nsouthwards by the Unicorn, it gets clearer, and opens out in Argo, and\r\ndescends still south, becoming brighter near the Southern Cross. It\r\nthen passes northward again, dividing into two branches, one of which\r\ndies out, and then over Sagittarius, and so on to Cygnus, then to\r\nCasseopeia and the starting-point. The number of stars in the Galaxy is\r\nabout 18,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 628.—The Milky Way.]\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful zone of stars the centre of our system, the sun, is\r\nplaced. It was supposed to be divided as in the diagram above; the\r\ninner portion being the stars seen in their thickness, and the outer\r\nring representing the stars viewed in the direction of the length and\r\nbreadth. But afterwards, Herschel modified his opinions respecting\r\nthe Milky Way, and since his death many astronomers—and Mr. Proctor\r\nmore particularly—have devoted considerable time to an examination of\r\nthis wonderful zone of stars; which, it must be remembered, is not a\r\ncontinuous stream; it is a series of luminous patches. On this point\r\nProfessor Nichol says:—\r\n\r\n“It is only to the most careless glance that the Milky Way appears a\r\ncontinuous zone. Let the naked eye rest thoughtfully on any part of\r\nit, and if circumstances are favourable, it will stand out rather as\r\nan accumulation of patches and streams of light in every conceivable\r\nvariety of form and brightness; now side by side, now heaped on each\r\nother, again spanning across dark spaces ... and at other times darting\r\noff into the neighbouring skies in branches of capricious length and\r\nshape, which gradually thin away and disappear.”\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way has its greatest breadth in the “Swan,” and in the\r\n“Eagle” constellation it divides itself. In the “Southern Triangle”\r\nthe zone is brightest, and in the “Southern Cross” the hole or space,\r\ntermed by sailors the “Coal Sack,” is very distinct. It then contracts\r\nand expands, and there is in Argo another gap. Then it is lost for a\r\nspace, then it branches out, and soon crosses the Equator, dilates,\r\ncontracts, opens out again, and so returns to the “Swan” again.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have frequently discoursed upon this phenomenon, but all\r\nstatements must remain more or less speculative. From Kepler’s to the\r\npresent time astronomers have been considering the Milky Way, and\r\nwhen the Nebular theory was given up, when the Galaxy was found to be\r\ncomposed of stars, there was, as we have noticed, the idea of the ring\r\nand the cloven disc. Mr. R. Proctor has likened the Galaxy to a coiled\r\nserpent, and considers the openings in the Milky Way as evidence that\r\nthe stratum of stars is limited, and that here we can see beyond it.\r\nIn fact, it would appear that it is a very complicated question; and\r\nas the zone itself is complicated “with outlying branches beyond the\r\nrange of our most powerful telescopes,” so an actual knowledge of the\r\nMilky Way is beyond us at present. It is composed of most extraordinary\r\naggregations of stars, which appear not only impossible to count, but\r\neach one to be independent of the other. Thus we must conclude our\r\nrapid survey of the Milky Way, and close with Mr. Proctor’s remark in\r\nhis “Universe of Stars.” “The sidereal system,” he says, “is altogether\r\nmore complicated, altogether more varied in structure than has hitherto\r\nbeen supposed. Within one and the same region co-exist stars of many\r\norders of real magnitude, the greatest being thousands of times larger\r\nthan the least. All the Nebulæ hitherto discovered, whether gaseous or\r\nstellar, irregular, planetary, ring-formed, or elliptic, exist within\r\nthe limits of the sidereal system. They all form part and parcel of\r\nthat wonderful system, whose nearer and brighter parts constitute the\r\nglories of our nocturnal heavens.”\r\n\r\nAnd a little reflection will show how true this is. Not very long ago\r\nin the world’s life the solar system was supposed to consist of one sun\r\nwith a few planets wandering around him. Then some more were found,\r\nand they were called “satellites.” For a long time man fancied he had\r\nreached the “ultima thule” of astronomy in these depths; but the whole\r\nidea was changed when it was discovered that beyond Mars there lie the\r\nasteroids and the host of bodies in this solar system which we cannot\r\ndo more than allude to. Then when we consider that this “sun” of ours,\r\nwhich we think so enormous, and which keeps in subjection so many\r\nheavenly bodies, and illuminates them; when we reflect that there are\r\nin space, and visible, stars many times larger than our ruling star,\r\neach a sun, and that our sun would, if put where the great Sirius\r\nglows, be but a speck in the firmament, and his system invisible to\r\nour eyes, we may well wonder at the magnitude of the subject, and the\r\nInfinite Wisdom and Power “that telleth the number of the stars, and\r\ncalleth them all by their names.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO READ THE SKY.\r\n\r\nA few particulars, to enable a reader to identify the most prominent\r\nstars, may be given as starting-points from which some few excursions\r\ninto the spangled heavens may be attempted. But the suggestions must\r\nbe considered with reference to the ever-varying directions of the\r\nsupposed lines in consequence of the daily revolution of the sphere.\r\nWe have illustrated this in the cut in the margin, wherein the Lesser\r\nBear is shown as swinging round the Polar Star in different positions.\r\nSometimes the lines of direction will be vertical, sometimes inclined,\r\nbut all retaining their relative positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 629.—The “Swing” of the Lesser Bear.]\r\n\r\nWe have already learnt that the “pointers” of the Great Bear indicate\r\nthe Polar Star in the Lesser Bear, and we can (roughly) estimate the\r\ndistance between the pointers as 5°. This will give us the distance\r\nbetween the pointers and the Polar Star as 29°. By following an\r\nimaginary line through the two northern stars of the “Waggon” (the\r\nBear) away from the “horses,” we shall find Capella about 50° away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 630.—Diagram of the Pole Star.]\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the first star next the waggon of “Charles’s Wain” to\r\nthe Pole Star, and past it, we shall arrive at an irregular W. This is\r\nCassiopeia, about as far beyond Polaris as the Bear is below it. When\r\nthe latter is low, the former is at the zenith, and so on.\r\n\r\nA line drawn from the Pole Star through the end star of the Great\r\nBear leads to Arcturus. A line taken from Arcturus for about an equal\r\ndistance will, with the Pole Star, make a triangle with Vega. The Polar\r\nStar may be called the Apex.\r\n\r\nRegulus may be found southwards by drawing a line through the two first\r\nstars of the square in the Bear (opposite the pointers). From Vega,\r\nalmost opposite the Pole Star, and through it about twice as far away\r\non the other side, is Sirius, a brilliant “sun.” Procyon will be found\r\nto the westward of Regulus about 30°. From Procyon to the Pole Star a\r\nline will pass through Pollux and Castor.\r\n\r\nAnother line from the pole star through the middle of the three\r\n“horses” in the “Wain” will reach Spica Virginis about 70° beyond. So\r\nwe can describe a large triangle with Spica, Regulus, and Arcturus, at\r\nthe angles. Regulus is the apex, Spica and Arcturus a short base line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 631.—Diagram of Sirius, etc.]\r\n\r\nFrom the pole star through Capella, passing between Betelgeux and\r\nBellatrix, we shall describe a line leading to the three stars of\r\nOrion’s belt. Between it and the Pleiades is Aldebaran.\r\n\r\nThere are many other stars which could be indicated; but on a fine\r\nevening, if the observer will mark them upon a piece of paper, placing\r\nthe pole star in the centre, he will be able to add to his star map\r\nvery rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters of Astronomy we have seen how the earth and\r\nother planets move around the sun; we have glanced at the “fixed”\r\nstars and their groups, termed the constellations, and have noted\r\nthe planets and their characteristics, with many other interesting\r\nfacts. There is yet a great deal to be learnt, and much study will be\r\nrequired with daily (nightly) observations before the young reader\r\nwill obtain success as a student of astronomy; but there is no study\r\nso interesting. We have seen what a very small portion of the universe\r\nis occupied by our solar system, and what a speck our earth is on\r\nthe plain of creation. We find ourselves on the border-land of the\r\nincomprehensible, and we are lost in speculations upon the unseen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. Burnham has lately given a list of two hundred and fifty-one\r\nnew double stars, and in the Astronomical Society’s proceedings there\r\nis a list of ten thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nNEW ASTRONOMICAL APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\n A CELESTIAL INDICATOR—ASTRONOMICAL OR COSMOGRAPHICAL CLOCK—A SIMPLE\r\n GLOBE—A SOLAR CHRONOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving said something concerning astronomy, we will give a few\r\ninstructions respecting the instruments not already described, and\r\nmake some observations, supplementing our directions in the previous\r\nchapter, for many people will be glad to learn how to read the evening\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nHere we have an apparatus which will prove useful to amateurs; it is\r\na sort of celestial indicator by Mauperin, and will facilitate the\r\nfinding of every star or constellation, when the apparatus has been\r\nmade ready by pointing the rod, T, in the direction of the object it\r\nis desired to view. This rod is mounted upon a rod, S, and is movable\r\nupwards or downwards or sideways, and in the last-named movement it\r\nwill carry with it an indicator, I, which slides over the chart or\r\ndiagram of the heavens. The two arms of this indicator are always\r\nparallel to the plane of the rod, T, no matter in what position they\r\nmay be on the chart or the inclination of the rod. The extremities of\r\nthis rod are terminated by an eye-slit, and by a crescent respectively.\r\n\r\nWhen the apparatus is set, all one has to do is to look through the eye\r\naperture, O, and view the star which we have chosen in the centre of\r\nthe crescent, C. This star will be found named in the space between the\r\narms of the sliding indicator, I.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perform the operation inversely—that is to say, to find\r\nin the sky, by means of the sighting-rod, T, the stars we have chosen\r\non the chart between the prongs of the indicator. The chart represents\r\nexactly the heavens as we see them, and this new mode is opposed to the\r\nmanner generally adopted with celestial charts, and is very important,\r\nfor it obviates the necessity of holding the map above one’s head, its\r\nface downwards.\r\n\r\nAs we have already showed, it is not difficult to find the Polar\r\nStar and the Great Bear. The latter is readily recognised by its\r\nseven stars, and the Lesser Bear glides around the pole as shown in\r\nthe diagram on the preceding page (fig. 629). Now let us see how the\r\ncelestial indicator will work.\r\n\r\nLet us take the apparatus into the open air, and place it upon its\r\ntripod stand. The upper portion will be found movable by loosening the\r\nscrew, V. By another simple arrangement the table can be slanted, and\r\nby turning a screw we can entirely slope the side of the chart where\r\nmidnight (_minuit_) is written. Being placed opposite the polar star we\r\ntake the upper part of the chart by the button, G, and bring it before\r\nus by a horizontal rotative movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 632.—Celestial Indicator.]\r\n\r\nWe now place the sliding indicator upon midday (_midi_), and keep it in\r\nthat position while working the apparatus—that is, until we have caught\r\nsight of the polar star in the centre of the crescent, C, by means of\r\nthe eye aperture, O. We have now obtained the meridian, and care should\r\nbe taken to tighten the screw, V. Then the table is raised to its fixed\r\nplace upon the support; it is regulated according to the latitude of\r\nthe place, and the apparatus is then “oriented.”\r\n\r\nThe upper disc is an elliptical opening, or aperture, which contains\r\nfor every moment the stars visible upon the horizon, and the\r\ncircumference is furnished with a graduated scale of hours divided into\r\nfive-minute divisions, and this is fixed upon the apparatus. The dotted\r\nline between the midday and midnight points gives the meridian.\r\n\r\nThe disc placed underneath is the celestial chart, on the circumference\r\nof which we shall find the days of the months. It can be moved around\r\nthe rod, S, which represents the axis of the earth around which the\r\nheavens are supposed to revolve. When the stars have to be observed,\r\nthe day of the month has to be brought to the time at which the\r\nobservation is about to be made. We can easily read off the chart by\r\nlooking through the eye-piece as already explained. Every five minutes\r\nit is necessary to move the chart one division, which indicates that\r\nfive minutes have passed; (other stars are, of course, arriving). The\r\napparatus can be packed away when done with, or the bearings taken, and\r\nthen the trouble of getting it into position again need not be repeated.\r\n\r\nA small lamp, L, throws its light upon the chart in such a way that\r\nthe eyes of the observer are not incommoded, while the table is fully\r\nilluminated. It can be placed at L´ if necessary. The inclination\r\nvaries according to the latitude of the place when the observations\r\nare made. There is an arrangement underneath which admits of this\r\ninclination according to longitude.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus can also be made available to ascertain what the aspect\r\nof the heavens will be upon any particular evening of the month. We\r\nhave only to place the chart at the day and hour, and we shall then see\r\nupon it all the stars visible above the horizon. We can thus find out\r\nat what time the stars rise and set, and those which do not set—to find\r\nthe hour at which they pass the meridian (the line drawn between midday\r\nand midnight upon the chart), and the time of their appearance on the\r\nhorizon. When the sliding indicator, I, does not show a star that is\r\ndiscoverable in the sky, the observer may conclude that he is viewing a\r\nplanet. This apparatus is well adapted for beginners in astronomy, as\r\nno deep preparatory study is necessary, and the tyro can read the sky\r\nas easily as he could read a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COSMOGRAPHICAL CLOCK.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the foregoing chapters upon Astronomy, endeavoured to\r\ngive the reader some idea respecting the inclination of the earth\r\nand its rotation, and writers have often endeavoured to devise an\r\napparatus which shall show the position of the globe in space, its\r\ndiurnal motion—even its inclination and the succession of seasons in\r\nits revolution round the sun. But such reproductions of simultaneous\r\nmovements have hitherto been obtained only on a very large scale, which\r\nfind their place well enough in the museum or lecture-room, but which\r\nit is quite impossible to utilize in our sitting-rooms, on our tables,\r\nor chimney-pieces. Besides, the usual apparatus employed is a very\r\ncostly one, and only serves for occasional representation; it will not\r\nkeep the facts constantly before the observer in the manner of a clock\r\nshowing the time.\r\n\r\nBut for all who are interested in Astronomy, or in Cosmography, or even\r\nfor a young person who desires merely to understand the reality of the\r\nearth’s motion and how our earth is placed in the universe—for any one\r\nwho deems it of use that he or she should be able to see the signs and\r\nthe seasons, and the days and years, and how the earth revolves, may\r\nobtain an astronomical or cosmographical clock, which will tell him or\r\nher how the “world wags”; a useful as well as an ornamental timepiece.\r\n\r\nNow this is precisely the result which the talented inventor of the\r\nastronomical clock has arrived at. M. Mouret devoted a great portion\r\nof his life and all his available means to the realization of his\r\ngreat idea, and, sad to say, he died miserably in an attic the very\r\nday before his great and deserving effort brought him the reward for\r\nwhich he had so painfully striven and devoted himself to by a life of\r\nself-denial and labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 633.—Cosmographical clock.]\r\n\r\nM. Mouret communicated to his globe the astronomical movement, which\r\nour earth possesses, by the aid of clock-work, which conveys to\r\nit, second by second, at each stroke of the pendulum, the double\r\nmovement of rotation and progression. The globe turns upon its axis\r\nin twenty-four hours, and thus one can perceive, without any mental\r\neffort, the rotation of our planet, and the portions of the globe\r\nwhich come under the influence of the sun in rotation, just as they\r\ndo actually on the earth. Not the least interesting attribute of this\r\ningenious arrangement is the fact that during breakfast or dinner one\r\ncan see the displacement and revolution of the earth with reference\r\nto the sun to all people in the world. Here, on the meridian, all\r\nare at midday. There, on the left, near the circle which defines the\r\nlimit between day and night, the sun is rising and day is beginning;\r\nopposite, on the right, the sun is setting and day is closing. Yonder\r\nis the Pacific Ocean in full daylight, while almost every continent is\r\nin darkness and the inhabitants wrapped in slumber. Now the Chinese are\r\nopening their eyes, and the Asiatic and European continents will soon\r\nbe illuminated and awake. This is the movement of the world as it has\r\never been since time came into its calculations.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious inventor, who wished to make a clock of his apparatus,\r\nand not being able to change its place on the earth from day to day\r\nas the time changed, very cleverly reproduced the sun’s movement of\r\ndeclination by making it describe a double cone at the axis of the\r\nglobe. At the equinoxes the poles are in a plane, and equal day and\r\nnight are shown. At the winter solstice the north pole is inclined\r\nbackwards at an angle 23° 28´, and our hemisphere is in the winter\r\nseason. We have then only eight hours’ daylight and sixteen of\r\ndarkness; six months later the pole is inclined towards the sun, and\r\nthe southern pole is plunged in darkness. We have the long days and\r\nthe southerners the long nights. An upright dial shows the time of the\r\ncountry in which the globe may happen to be, and one can ascertain at\r\nany moment what time it is anywhere else. A horizontal dial indicates\r\nthe day of the month, and changes every day in a manner corresponding\r\nwith the movement of the earth around the sun, reproduced by means of\r\nthe arrangement with the double cone. The spectator is supposed to be\r\nturning his back to the sun.\r\n\r\nWe may add that these movements are all self-acting, and there is no\r\nneed to interfere with the clock, which is wound up like ordinary\r\ntimepieces. By an ingenious forethought the inventor provided that the\r\nsphere should be independent of the other movements, and it can be used\r\nfor demonstration in the hands of the lecturer, and be explained with\r\nall its motions without in any way disarranging the clock-work. The\r\nglobe must, of course, when replaced, be put exactly at the correct day\r\nand hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE.\r\n\r\nA terrestrial globe without any mechanism, so long as its axis is\r\nparallel to that of the earth, _exposed to the direct rays of the sun_,\r\nrepresents our planet with its recurrence of day and night.\r\n\r\nThe figure (634) shows us a globe without any support. The axis is\r\nnorth and south, and makes, with the horizon, an angle equal to the\r\nlatitude of Paris, if the support, A B, be horizontal. To make the axis\r\nof the globe parallel to the axis of our earth, the line, N S, must\r\ncorrespond to the meridian of the place; this can be done with the\r\ncompass, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe solar rays always illuminate one-half of a sphere, no matter what\r\nits dimensions. If we look at the illustration we shall see that the\r\nline of separation between the light and dark portions of the globe\r\ncorresponds with that in our earth. This globe, then, tells us the\r\npassage of light and darkness for the day, and even for the moment\r\nof the day, when it is turned as the earth moves. The place examined\r\nshould be placed in the meridian of that place (Paris, for instance),\r\nand occupy the most elevated spot on the globe. The earth is then in\r\njust the same position, and daylight and darkness are shown exactly as\r\nthey exist on the earth at the time.\r\n\r\nIf this globe be then observed for a few minutes, the sun will be seen\r\nrising and setting, as it were, in various places (we must remember we\r\nhave concentrated the _sun’s_ rays, not a lamp, upon the globe). The\r\nplaces on the right, if the observer be placed facing the sun, will\r\ncome out of the shade, and those on the left will enter it. The former\r\nare then really enjoying the sunrise, and the others are actually\r\nwitnessing his setting.\r\n\r\nThe globe represented, making the double revolution of our planet in\r\nthe year, will reproduce all the actual phenomena of day and night as\r\ntaking place on the earth itself if we stand at a little distance so as\r\nto observe it all at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 634.—A simple terrestrial globe.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the employment of this simple apparatus should not exclude\r\nmore complicated ones, for the former can only be used on a fine bright\r\nday. But the advantage claimed for it is that in it we can imitate\r\nnature exactly. Illuminated, as it is, by the real sun, the portions of\r\nlight and shade are indicated by the rays and not by a metallic circle.\r\n\r\nIn order that the line of demarcation may be exactly defined, it will\r\nbe necessary that the sun’s rays be concentrated upon the globe, and\r\nthat no lateral or vertical light be admitted. The curtains should\r\ntherefore be so arranged, and the blinds pulled down to a certain\r\npoint, and if the stand or support be painted black it will be found an\r\nadvantage. If the globe be a small one, it will be sufficient to place\r\nthe stand upon an ordinary table, without verifying the horizontal\r\nplane. With a large globe the arrangement must be very exact.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLAR CHRONOMETER.\r\n\r\nM. Flechet’s chronometer, of which we give an illustration, is a kind\r\nof equitorial reduced to its most simple form. It is possible to\r\nascertain the exact time by it very easily. It consists of a disc, AB,\r\ndivided into twenty-four hours and fractions of hours. This disc turns\r\nupon itself around an arc, CD, which has a direction parallel to the\r\naxis of the world, and can be moved on a joint, E, according to the\r\nlatitude of the place; F is a lens which can be moved and presented\r\nto the sun at any time, forming the centre of a concave and exactly\r\nspherical plate represented at GH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 635.—Solar chronometer.]\r\n\r\nWhen the instrument is fixed so that the axis, CD, is parallel to the\r\naxis of the globe, the disc, AB, is turned so that the centre of the\r\nimage of the sun, produced by the lens, shall fall at _m_. The real\r\ntime is found by an examination of the position of the index, A, upon\r\nthe hour graduations of the disc. A French writer, Ch. Delounay, has\r\nmentioned this instrument, and considers it easy of arrangement, exact\r\nin time, and very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.—I. GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY—THE EARTH’S CRUST—ORIGIN OF THE EARTH—DENUDATION\r\n AND EXCAVATION BY WATER—ROCKS, GRAVEL, AND SAND—CLASSES OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 636.—Cliffs worn by the sea.]\r\n\r\nWhen we were at school, and learnt the various countries of Europe, we\r\nhad maps showing us the several divisions of one realm from another;\r\nthe mountains, lakes, and other prominent features of the continent\r\nwere learned and repeated, but we, maybe, seldom, perhaps never,\r\nbestowed a thought upon the formations of the mountains, and the manner\r\nin which rivers ran down into and through lakes to the ocean. There\r\nwere the mountains, there were the lakes and rivers, and capes, and\r\nheadlands, and there they are still, to all intents and purposes, the\r\nsame to see, to climb up, to sail down, as the case may be. But the map\r\nof Europe has undergone a visible change. Territory has changed hands.\r\nGermany has gripped France, England has got Cyprus, Turkey has been\r\ndismembered, and Austria is annexing territory. This study is called\r\nGeography,—POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,—for it marks the political boundaries.\r\nThe knowledge of the formation of hills, headlands, lakes, rivers,\r\nseas, their causes, constitution, and effects, how they rose, how\r\nthey exist and wax or wane during the course of centuries is PHYSICAL\r\nGEOGRAPHY, which we propose to consider.\r\n\r\nThis tree of knowledge includes some very important branches, almost\r\nparent stems. As a magnificent oak spreads forth its brawny arms, with\r\nsmaller branches and twigs, each of these great branches being as large\r\nas an ordinary tree, so Physical Geography includes other arms such\r\nas Geology, Meteorology, Botany, and Physiology—even Astronomy in its\r\ncomprehensive embrace. We find it is a difficult task to separate these\r\nkindred sciences from the great tree. We may have therefore to refer to\r\nearth, air, and water, and their various forms in hills and mountains,\r\nwind, vapour, rain, glaciers, and sea. We must learn how this earth has\r\nbeen gradually cooled, and what the various stages of its growth have\r\ndone. We must consider plant and animal life upon our planet, and how\r\nthe atmosphere affects them. All this is Physical Geography, and its\r\nsatellite sciences of Geology, Meteorology, “Climatology,” Botany, and\r\nPhysiology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 637.—Disintegrated granite.]\r\n\r\n“Everything must have a beginning,” and the earth must have had a\r\nbeginning, although the actual manner of the physical creation of the\r\nplanet is a disputed fact. We are not about to discuss the religious\r\nside of the question, although we should undoubtedly find that Biblical\r\nand Geologic teaching run side by side towards the same end, and the\r\ntestimony of the earth and sky bears witness to the Divine hand that\r\ncreated the universe, which we can trace back to the dim and distant\r\nages when “the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon\r\nthe face of the deep.”\r\n\r\nWith this brief preface, let us consider some of these aspects, and\r\npick up interesting facts from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIn the chemical and mineral sections of this volume we have heard\r\nsomething concerning the formation of the globe and its composition,\r\nits clays, rocks, etc. With these internal arrangements Chemistry and\r\nMineralogy have dealt. Geology tells us about the external surface\r\nof the earth, its stones and rocks, and how they were formed, and\r\ngenerally something about the conformation of the crust of the earth,\r\nand its history.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of “crust” of the earth, we do not simply mean the\r\nexterior layer of gravel, clay, or stone. The crust is a thick one,\r\nand our crust extends just so far as we can cut into it. The surface\r\nof the sea can scarcely be termed a crust, but we must penetrate that\r\never-moving liquid boundary, and touch upon (and examine) what lies\r\ndown below far beyond the “full fathom five” of the lead line. In this\r\nstudy we must not forget our Book of Nature, which is always open and\r\ninviting us to read. We shall see how things are produced, and how\r\nour physical surroundings will continue to be produced until the age\r\nof miracles returns, and Providence sees fit to interfere with the\r\notherwise immutable laws which He in His wisdom has laid down for the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nIt will be of no use to go back into space and imagine the world a\r\nred-hot fragment of matter, whirling through the heaven around the sun\r\nwhich, as a larger aggregation of burning atoms, kept it, as it now\r\nkeeps it, in its place. The earth was a globe of liquid fire, or in\r\ngaseous state, and the atoms gradually cooled on the surface; the fire\r\nis still under our feet. The outer part would by degrees lose all its\r\nheat, while the interior remained hot; the planet must then have been\r\nsurrounded by a steamy atmosphere, and enveloped in vapours condensed\r\nfrom the air through which no light of the sun could by any appreciable\r\ndegree penetrate.\r\n\r\nWe can give an example of this, and it will be seen how the surface\r\nof the earth gradually became formed from the vaporous condition. If\r\nany one will take the pains to evaporate any saline solution in a\r\ncapsule till it is about to crystallise, and observe attentively the\r\npellicle of salt as it forms on the surface; first a partial film will\r\nshow itself in a few places, floating about and joining with others,\r\nthen when nearly the whole surface is coated, it will break up in some\r\nplaces and sink into the liquid beneath, another pellicle will form and\r\njoin with the remains of the first, and as this thickens it will push\r\nup ridges and inequalities of the surface from openings and fissures\r\nin which little jets of steam and fluid will escape; these little\r\nridges are chains of mountains, the little jets of steam those volcanic\r\neruptions which were at that period so frequent, the surface of the\r\ncapsule is the surface of the earth, and the five minutes which the\r\nobserver has contemplated it, a million years.\r\n\r\nThe next effect of the cooling of the earth would be the gradual\r\ncondensation of the vapour of water with which it was surrounded; this\r\nfalling upon the earth formed seas and oceans, leaving only the higher\r\nportions exposed above its level. The clearing up of the dense dark\r\nclouds for the first time let in upon the earth’s surface the glorious\r\nand vivifying rays of the sun, and this great effect possibly accords\r\nwith the earliest record in the Bible of the acts of creation: “And God\r\nsaid, let there be light, and there was light.”\r\n\r\nThis clearing up of the vapours and the subsequent rain no doubt gave\r\nrise to terribly grand electrical phenomena—thunderings and lightnings.\r\nBy degrees the waters got their own way, and then many changes took\r\nplace, land and water fighting, as it were, for the mastery, as they\r\nare fighting to this day.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps some reader may not think that the land and water of our\r\nearth are thus engaged. A very few minutes’ reflection will suffice\r\nto confirm our assertion. Look at the lofty crags in the Alps, for\r\ninstance; what has shattered those peaks, and sent the masses toppling\r\ndown in stone avalanches to the lower slopes, and then into the\r\nvalleys?—Water. Water has been in the crevices, and was frozen there;\r\nin freezing it expanded and loosened the crags, which, forced asunder,\r\ngave an opening to more snow and ice, and so this powerful leverage,\r\naided by the wind and storm, is disintegrating our mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 638.—Breakers on the coast of Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nIt is the same by the seashore; the cliffs are wearing away, and the\r\nsea approaches; at other places the sea recedes from the land, as\r\ncoral formation and embryo chalk cliffs are rising under the surface\r\nof the ocean. Lakes dry up, and the meadow or farm arises on the site,\r\nwhile other old spots are submerged. No rest, no change of idea, but\r\never changing in physical appearance, Nature goes on her wondrous way,\r\nworking now as steadily, as harmoniously, and as surely as she did\r\nbefore time was, and as she will continue to do when time shall be no\r\nmore!\r\n\r\nIn our investigations into Geology we cannot enter into many technical\r\ndetails. Our object in these pages is recreation; but we shall, even\r\nunder these circumstances, find plenty to interest, and sufficient\r\nto lead any one who wishes to pursue the study for himself. We will\r\nendeavour so to put the features of the stones and rocks before him\r\nthat they will be recognized by the passer by. We will try to show how\r\nthe earth has been built up, and how the great and terrible changes\r\nthrough which our little globe has passed have been effected. In our\r\nown islands, Great Britain and Ireland, we shall find traces of all\r\nthe materials likely to be useful to us in our quest, As has been well\r\nsaid, “Geology is the Physical Geography of the past.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 639.—Shells in chalk.]\r\n\r\nThe descent from rocks to stones, from stones to gravel, from gravel\r\nto sand, is evident to everyone, so we need not insist upon the fact\r\nthat sand is powdered rock, and that an aggregation of sand particles\r\nmakes stones. We have heard in the _Mineralogy_ section that there are\r\ncertain “earths”—silica, alumina, lime, etc. Of these “earths,” the two\r\nformer constitute the greater portion of the ROCKS. Lime, also, is very\r\nevident, and in limestones fossils or organic remains are abundant. Now\r\nwe must entirely put away from our minds the old idea that the earth\r\nwe live on was created at once, or as it appeared to the first human\r\nbeings. Our planet was prepared for man by degrees during millions\r\nof years. We conclude that the earth was originally composed of\r\ncertain elements, and we find the same elements in the sun. Therefore,\r\nsupposing (as is supposed) that the earth came from the sun, we have\r\nall the material of the globe in a fused state. As the earth cooled,\r\nrocks were formed by pressure, and then water came, and now we can read\r\n“books in the running brooks, and sermons in stones” at our leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 640.—The streamlet.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps as someone reads this he may be walking by the seashore kicking\r\nthe pebbles or seated upon the sands, the grains of which are so very\r\ntiny. He will probably find sand, shingle, and gravel within reach, and\r\nperhaps the curious-looking “pudding stone.” Now what can we learn from\r\nthese stones or sand grains or that curious bit of _conglomerate_?\r\nPerhaps the reader may be at Ramsgate or Margate or another place where\r\nthe “white cliffs of Albion” glisten in the sun. Take up a piece of\r\nchalk and examine it. It is soft and soils your hands, and you will\r\nthrow it away, perhaps—but don’t. Take it home and put it under the\r\nmicroscope or a good magnifying glass. What do you see?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 641.—Cliffs showing strata.]\r\n\r\nYou will find the _remains of animals_—that is, shells and tiny bits\r\nof coral packed close together. Under the microscope they will become\r\nmore separated, and the grains will be distinct fragments of shells,\r\netc. If this little bit of chalk be composed of marine animals’ shells,\r\nof course the whole cliff is composed of the same kind of material.\r\nBut how did the shells get into the chalk? Shells are chalk—carbonate\r\nof lime; lime was deposited at the bottom of the sea, and the infinite\r\nmillions of minute animals formed themselves shells, and left them to\r\nbe piled up by Nature’s forces into cliffs during countless ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 642.—Limestone with encrinites.]\r\n\r\nYes, but how did the lime get into the water to make the shells? We\r\nwill endeavour to explain. Rain, when falling, takes some carbonic\r\nacid from the air, which we know contains it. This acts upon the lime\r\nin the rocks (lime is oxide of calcium, and calcium is an element\r\nin the earth), so we get a bi-carbonate of lime (soluble in water),\r\nwhich rises from the rocks in springs. These springs and their streams\r\ndeposit lime, as we can see in caverns where we find stalactites and\r\nstalagmites. The lime is transmitted to the ocean, and absorbed by the\r\ncrinoideans and molluscs which produced shells. These shells hardened\r\nand crystallized became limestone, and whole mountains are formed of\r\nthis “organic” rock, which is used for so many purposes.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of ORGANIC ROCKS, but there are others, and we ought,\r\nperhaps, to have spoken of that kind before the chalk put them aside.\r\nLet us go back to our sandy shore again and look at the SEDIMENTARY\r\nROCKS, which are the very first formation. We have all seen sandstone,\r\nand visitors to the South Devon Coast will remember the red cliffs near\r\nDawlish and Teignmouth. These are red sandstone—not the very “old red”\r\nso pleasantly written of by Hugh Miller, but at any rate sandstone, and\r\ncomposed of grains of sand. When we were at Dawlish last year a piece\r\nof the sandstone had fallen on to the beach, and when the waves came up\r\nthat stone was no doubt gradually washed away into sand, and then fell\r\nto the earth as _sediment_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 643.—Chalk cliff.]\r\n\r\nWe said something a few pages back about the wear and tear which\r\nis always going on: the mountain is worn away—a mass falls, it is\r\nbroken into smaller pieces; these are carried by a river; the mud is\r\ndeposited, and the finer particles are ground and rounded into gravel,\r\nand finally sand. Beneath the current of the river, and at the bottom\r\nof a lake or sea, these sediments (mud, etc.) accumulate one on the top\r\nof the other in regular series called _strata_, and then the weight and\r\npressure acting with the soluble mineral deposits always washing down,\r\nconsolidate and bind the loose sand-grains into stone, which, in the\r\ncourse of ages, hardens. The stones thus formed from sediments such as\r\ngravel, mud, and sand, are termed _Sedimentary Rocks_; they have become\r\nrocks by enormous and continuous pressure. Thus:—\r\n\r\n  Sands have become “Sandstones”;\r\n  Gravel has become “Pudding-stone” (Conglomerate);\r\n  Mud and clay have become “Shale”;\r\n  Calcareous deposits have become “Limestone”;\r\n  Vegetable deposits have become “Coal.”\r\n\r\nSo we have sandy, clayey, limy, flinty, and corally rocks under long\r\nnames respectively—Arenarious, Argillaceous, Calcareous, Silicious; and\r\nwe may add Bitumenous and Ferruginous—Irony Rocks—to the list.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of sediments, it is curious to note the different colours of\r\nthe Arve and the Rhone which meet near Geneva. The white sedimentary\r\nArve can be traced for a long distance beside, not mixing with, the\r\nblue Rhone. The same effect can be traced where the latter river\r\nenters the Lake of Geneva. So the land is being perpetually carried\r\naway and deposited; and where water gains on land there is somewhere\r\nelse always a corresponding elevation to compensate it. Thus places\r\ndisappear, and the sea washes over the site, as on the Kentish Coast,\r\nwhere Earl Godwin’s land was inundated, and new land is reclaimed or is\r\nelevated from the sea to make up the balance.\r\n\r\n    “There rolls the deep, where grew the tree;\r\n    Oh, earth, what changes hast thou seen!\r\n    There, where the long street roars, has been\r\n    The stillness of the central sea.”\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of sedimentary and organic rocks. There is yet another\r\nkind called igneous, or fiery rocks—those upraised by volcanic action.\r\nOf the igneous rocks the crystalline have been evidently in a fused\r\ncondition. Granite is an example; lava or basalt is the usual term\r\nfor volcanic rock, and the basaltic caves of Staffa and the Giants’\r\nCauseway bear testimony to the igneous or volcanic origin of the\r\nsurroundings. The pillars and fantastic rocks of Ireland and Scotland\r\nwhich are so remarkable, are simply lava, which was erupted in a molten\r\nstate, now cooled and contracted into blocks of curious regularity of\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 644.—Trap rock (Staffa).]\r\n\r\nGranite, already referred to, is another igneous rock, and must have\r\nbeen forced upwards; for as an igneous rock granite has cooled beneath\r\nthe crust of the earth, throwing out arms, while melting, into other\r\nformations, and frequently being found in mountains. There is another\r\nkind of igneous rocks formed by the continuous accumulation of the\r\nashes, etc., vomited forth from volcanoes. Masses of mountain are thus\r\nproduced in the course of years, and the material thus formed is called\r\n_tufa_, or tuff, when consolidated; and this (now solidified) is what\r\ncaused the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 645.—Eruption of granite.]\r\n\r\nSo we have two classes of IGNEOUS ROCKS, the Crystalline and\r\nFragmental (or the “Plutonic” and “Volcanic”), including basalts,\r\npitchstones, pumice, trachytes, granite, syenite, etc.; and, on the\r\nother hand, tuff and “volcanic” breccia, with felstones, porphyries,\r\netc., which have been classed as intermediary.\r\n\r\nOf these three classes of rocks, the sedimentary and the organic\r\ncompose the greater portion of the earth. We will now glance at the\r\ncrust of the earth and its various formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Volcanic eruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n CRUST OF THE EARTH—GEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS—EOZOIC, PRIMARY, SECONDARY,\r\n TERTIARY, PREHISTORIC FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crust of Great Britain has been carefully examined, and from\r\nthe results of investigations at various periods, the earth has\r\nbeen divided into a series of strata which follow the same order of\r\nsuccession. Sometimes certain strata may not be present, and they may\r\nbe replaced by others, but the same order of succession will be found.\r\nThe order is as follows, commencing at the _lowest_. The illustration\r\nis taken in the opposite direction:—\r\n\r\n              { Laurentian        }   Until recently believed to\r\n  “Eozoic.”   { Cambrian          } be without traces of living\r\n              {                   } creatures; hence “Eozoic.”\r\n\r\n  Palæzoic,   { Silurian          }\r\n  or          { Old Red Sandstone }   Shell-fish, seaweed,\r\n  Primary.    { Carboniferous     } ferns, fish, low reptiles.\r\n              { Permian           }\r\n\r\n  Mesozoic,   { Triassic (Upper   }\r\n  or          {   Red Sandstone)  }\r\n  Secondary.  { Oolitic           } Birds, marsupials, reptiles.\r\n              { Cretaceous        }\r\n\r\n  Kainzoic,   { Eocene            }   Superior life.

It will be perceived from the above list that\r\nthe Laurentian Rocks are the oldest. The name is derived from the\r\nSt. Lawrence formations, and was given to the strata by Sir William\r\nLogan. They are metamorphosed rocks older than the Cambrian. These\r\nrocks are sedimentary, of very old deposition, and of a crystalline\r\nnature, consisting of quartz, gneiss, etc. The granite was probably\r\nformed by the fusion of its component constituents, quartz, mica, and\r\nfelspar, which become crystallized by the excessive heat. For a long\r\ntime no traces of organisms could be detected in this or the Cambrian\r\nsystems, but modern research has been rewarded with a little success.\r\nThe original deposits of micaceous gneiss, etc., have been altered,\r\nand many true igneous rocks, such as syenite and granite, are found\r\nin them. These very old rocks must have been originally deposited in\r\nstrata converted by heat and pressure into crystalline rocks. These\r\nrocks have been divided into two series, under the names of lower and\r\nupper Laurentian. They are metamorphic, and consist “mainly of gneiss\r\ninterstratified with mica-schist, with great beds of quartz, and\r\nmassive beds of crystalline limestone, of which one varies from 700\r\nto 1,500 feet in thickness. Conglomerates also occur, and there are\r\nvast deposits of magnetic and specular iron. Graphite, or blacklead,\r\nis disseminated in strings, veins, and beds through hundreds of feet\r\nof the lower Laurentian, and its amount is calculated by Dr. Dawson\r\nto be equal in quantity to the coal seams of an equal area of the\r\ncarboniferous rocks” (Nicholson).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 647.—Upward Granite (Section).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 648.—Conformable Strata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 649.—Unconformable Strata.]\r\n\r\nHitherto, no distinctly recognisable fossil has been discovered, with\r\nthe important exception of the _Eozoön Canadense_, which has been\r\npronounced to have been a gigantic foraminifer, growing layer upon\r\nlayer, and thus forming reefs of limestone; the subject, however, is\r\nstill a matter of dispute. The eozoön was discovered by Mr. J. M’Mullen\r\nin 1858 in Canada.\r\n\r\nGranite was at one time considered to be the true primitive rock.\r\nGneiss is a word of Saxon origin, and consists of the same materials as\r\ngranite in different proportions. Mica-schist is made up of two of the\r\nsame constituents as the granite and gneiss. They are without fossil\r\ntraces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 650.—Nereites Cambrensis.]\r\n\r\nThe CAMBRIAN system of aqueous origin may be said to contain evidence\r\nof the dawn of organic life. It is part of the clay-slate system, and\r\nthe term “Cambrian” is taken from the ancient name of Wales, where\r\nslate is plentiful. Mica-slate is also very important. These Cambrian\r\nrocks are of the next oldest formation to the Laurentian, and all\r\nthe various deposits may be examined in Wales, where also traces of\r\nvolcanic and ice action may readily be perceived. In the pass of\r\nLlanberis one immense ice-borne block is very prominent; no agency\r\nbut ice could have put it there as it rests. It is estimated that the\r\nCambrian and “Lower” Silurian rocks are from 20,000 to 30,000 feet in\r\nthickness, and must embrace a very lengthened period. The fossils of\r\nthese formations show that zoophytes and certain primitive crustacea\r\nlived in the remote ages when these rocks were formed by sedimentary\r\ndeposition. We have scarce a trace of plant-life. The organic remains\r\ninclude annular worms, the first arrangement of the articulated animals\r\naccording to Cuvier. The flora and fauna are, of course, very low in\r\nthe scale of creation, when land and sea were so differently arranged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 651.—Section across Snowdon.\r\n\r\nA, Fossiliferous grits (Bala series); B, Greenstone (intrusive); C,\r\nPorphyry; D, Volcanic ashes, sometimes calcareous and fossiliferous\r\nBala limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 652.—Silurian fossil.]\r\n\r\nThe SILURIAN system was so named by Sir. R. Murchison, after the\r\nterritory formerly occupied by the Silures, but the system is, of\r\ncourse, universal. We have here sandstones, limestones, and shales,\r\ndeposits lying upon the Welsh slate. The Upper and Lower Ludlow beds,\r\nand the “May Hill” sandstone, then the Lower Silurian, with Caradoc\r\nbeds, and the Tremadoc slate, etc. In this system volcanic action is\r\nobservable, and all the organic remains are those of marine animals,\r\nsuch as corals, shell-fish, marine worms, encrinites, molluscs, and\r\nother zoophytes in great variety. We find also a number of graptolites,\r\ntrilobites, echinus (sea-urchin), terebratula, and many other forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 653.—Trilobite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 654.—Terebratula.]\r\n\r\nThe Trilobites were amongst the first creatures inhabiting our globe,\r\nand it is a curious fact to contemplate, that their eyes (fig. 655)\r\nshould have been preserved perfect; they present one of those wonderful\r\nobjects which carry one’s thoughts backwards to the early ages of the\r\nworld, probably many millions of years, and yet it is found by the\r\npeculiar structure of the eyes of these Trilobites that they were\r\nplaced at the bottom of the sea with perfect power to look upwards at\r\nthe light of the sun through the transparent waters. The same hand and\r\nthe same power had then Divine care and solicitude for the well-being\r\nof His creatures, as great as He has for those of later ages, and these\r\nanimals are mentioned in Genesis—“Let the waters bring forth abundantly\r\nthe moving creature that hath life.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 655.—Eye of Trilobite.]\r\n\r\nThus we see that ages of comparative quiet succeeded the first great\r\ncontraction of the earth’s crust, probably millions of years, during\r\nwhich time the tides and currents of the ocean had to wash and wear\r\ndown all the thousands of projecting rocks or inequalities, and\r\ndissolve (as before described) all the lime, depositing the sand and\r\nclay in those immense strata which form the old-named “transition\r\nseries”; this appears to have taken place over nearly the whole world\r\nat that time, and ages upon ages must have elapsed to form such\r\ndeposits as the sandstone, claystone, and limestone, in alternation,\r\nforming the “Llandilo,” “Caradoc,” and “Wenlock” strata, more than a\r\nmile in thickness; these are by some geologists reckoned among the\r\nprimary series (by some called the “transition rocks”), and in England\r\nform the “Cambrian” and “Silurian” systems which are so rich in\r\nminerals and metallic veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 656.—Limestone made up of encrinite.]\r\n\r\nThe OLD RED SANDSTONE, or DEVONIAN System, is the next of the series\r\nof layers which built up our earth, but a great gap of years separates\r\nit from the Silurian. We find the “Old Red” in the Mendips and in\r\nScotland. The rocks in the West of England are apparently of later\r\ndeposition and of marine origin, while the “Old Red” is apparently a\r\nfresh-water deposit. It is very “arenaceous,” and owes its tint chiefly\r\nto iron, although there are circumstances in which it appears neither\r\nas a sandstone nor with a red colour; but red sandstone describes the\r\ntrue formation very accurately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 657.—Graptolites.]\r\n\r\nIn this water-deposited system, whether in lakes or by the sea, we\r\nfind a considerable advance upon the Silurian. We have flora in more\r\nvariety—seaweeds and ferns. The remains are all aquatic. We have\r\nnothing higher in the scale of creation than the fish, the first\r\nvertebrates; and judging by varieties a very considerable time must\r\nhave elapsed during which the Old Red Sandstone was deposited. The\r\ndipterus—or double-winged—is herewith shown as an example of the fossil\r\nfish of the Old Red Sandstone period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 658.—“Double-winged” Fish.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious that no remains of any land-inhabiting animals have\r\nbeen discovered in this system—whether in the Old Red or the Devonian\r\nformations (the Lower and Upper Red Sandstones). We can only\r\ndistinguish the remains of aquatic animals or plants. We may picture\r\nthe great cuttle-fish, the nautilus, and the dipterus, with various\r\norders of mollusca, and the gradual approach to the crustacea, but no\r\nterrestrial animals have been discovered. We may take it for granted\r\nthen that the Old Red Sandstone and Devonian systems are different—the\r\nformer being found in Scotland and parts of England, and formed of\r\ndeposits in fresh or brackish water, while in the Devonian system the\r\nmarine deposits are corals, and all the indications of ocean life,\r\nseparated from the great inland lakes by a range of hills. Neither\r\nof the terms (Old Red Sandstone or Devonian) limit geographically\r\nor descriptively the formations of this system. All the rocks are\r\nclearly distributed between the Silurian and the Carboniferous. The\r\ninvertebrates in this last system have not developed very much, but\r\ncorals are very abundant, and fish of some armoured species are\r\nplentiful and curious, while the crustacea were enormous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 659.—Palæozoic Fish. Trilobites, Brachiopods, Coral\r\nand Graptolite.]\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the most important of all the rock formations, the one\r\nto which we owe our national prosperity—we mean the COAL System.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS FORMATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the foregoing depositions were being made the earth was still\r\nundergoing changes. The sandstones were deposited, and the corals\r\nmaking use of the lime carried into the waters began to build and form\r\nmasses of limestone under the sea, pushing back the water and changing\r\nthe forms and positions of land and water. All this went on apparently\r\nvery quietly—volcanic action was not very frequent—the water was warm.\r\nBut sometimes earthquakes would heave up the submarine formations into\r\nmountains, and therefore we find the fossils of the tiny sea-animals\r\non the hills. Extensive swamps were formed by partially retreating\r\nsea-water, and their vegetation became luxuriant. Tree ferns and all\r\nthe floral appearance of the tropics grew up and formed dense forests,\r\nfar thicker than any we know of at the present time. It will readily\r\nbe understood that the condition of the atmosphere must have been\r\nparticularly favourable to the growth of plants, and therefore not\r\nsuitable for air-breathing animals. Heat and carbonic acid must have\r\nbeen greatly developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 660.—Tree Ferns.]\r\n\r\nWe can now perceive how the gradual filling up of the earth for man’s\r\nreception was taking place. The rain was taking carbonic acid from the\r\nair, for the dead plants gave it out in enormous volumes. The carbonate\r\nof lime dissolved in the water-springs, etc., was carried to the sea\r\nfor polypi to build shells from. The trees were absorbing carbonic\r\nacid, too, and while purifying the air, were retaining the carbon in\r\ntheir stems and leaves and branches, which (when they decayed) remained\r\nuntouched, and accumulated in thick layers to sink down, and by\r\npressure be turned into coal. This great effect was carried out several\r\ntimes; and it is a remarkable fact that we find coal, limestone, and\r\nironstone so near together, all useful to us and to each other in the\r\ncourse of the working of the minerals—so we come to the Carboniferous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 661.—Limestone made up of corals (_Favosites\r\npolymorpha_).]\r\n\r\nCoal we have already treated of in _Mineralogy_, and coal looks at\r\ntimes very different from our preconceived ideas of a _sedimentary_\r\nrock, which we know is regularly deposited in layers. But when we\r\nsplit or break the coal we find its cleavage in a certain direction.\r\nCoal is wood squeezed and petrified by ages between enormous layers of\r\nsedimentary rocks, and the coal-seam rests upon the soil in which the\r\nplants once grew—perhaps more than six hundred thousand years ago!\r\n\r\nOf course coal, as we burn it, was not all made at once. We can trace\r\nit from the swamp as Peat, on to “Lignite,” or woody coal, through the\r\nTertiary and New Red Sandstone to the coal measures themselves. Even\r\nlower down we find the remains in more or less pure carbon forms—the\r\nanthracite and the graphite of the primary formations.\r\n\r\nCoal appears not to have been formed equally in all places during the\r\nperiod in which it originated. The remains of plants found in these\r\nstrata lead us to infer, that, during that period there existed an\r\nexceedingly vigorous and crowded vegetation, consisting principally of\r\ntree ferns and equisetaceæ, of which the _Sphenopteris Hœninghausii_\r\n(fig. 662), _Pecopteris aquilina_ (fig. 663), and _Neuropteris Loshii_\r\n(fig. 664), are amongst the most beautiful that have been found, and\r\nthe flora and fauna of this period were of a more or less primitive\r\nkind or low order, but very luxurious. The former display a decided\r\nadvance, and reptiles of aquatic forms appear with large and predaceous\r\nfishes. Mountain limestone, which is usually found in the coal\r\nformations, includes metallic deposits, and organic remains are very\r\nabundant in it. The following are specimens of the fossils—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 662.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 663.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 664.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 665.—\r\n\r\n  1. Bellerophon costatus.\r\n  2. Spirifer glaber.\r\n  3. Productus Martini.\r\n  4. Orthoceras lateralis.]\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous system is a very important one, as may be seen. In\r\nthese beds we have coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. The _Coal\r\nMeasures_ consist of grit and sandstone and shale, with coal seams. The\r\nCarboniferous Limestone, or “Mountain” Limestone, has no coal in it.\r\nThe sandstone has been termed “Millstone Grit,” because millstones\r\nare made from it. We then have limestone shales, and the sandstone\r\nbeds. Each coal seam indicates a subsidence of the land and a regular\r\nseries of underclay or soil in which the plants grew,—the plants\r\nthemselves,—iron, coal, and then the shale, and so on again, indicating\r\nfrequent changes and a long lapse of ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 666.—Fern (_Pecopteris ligata_) from upper shale,\r\nScarborough.]\r\n\r\nThese “Coal Measures” occupy an area of five hundred square miles in\r\nGreat Britain alone; and as we have already said, the period which\r\nelapsed while these deposits were being laid down represents hundreds\r\nof thousands of years. The deposit would increase at the rate of about\r\nthree feet in a thousand years. And this is only one period of the many\r\nchanges to which our world has been subjected since it first began its\r\nrevolution in space around the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 667.—Section across the carboniferous rocks of\r\nDerbyshire and Lancashire (After Ramsay).\r\n\r\n  1. Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n  2. Yoredale Shales.\r\n  3. Millstone Grit.\r\n  4. Coral Measures.\r\n  5. Permian Limestone.\r\n  6. New Red Sandstone.]\r\n\r\nCoal is usually found in “basins” or depressions—a sort of trough owing\r\nto the upheaval of surrounding strata which became in time denuded (or\r\nwashed away) with any coal that was there. So it is in places where it\r\nis concealed by overlying beds that protect it, that we now find the\r\ncoal saved from disturbance. When we search and come upon red sandstone\r\nand grey-wacke, we may be almost certain that we are near coal,\r\nparticularly if the surrounding rocks form a “basin.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 668.—Labyrinthodon.]\r\n\r\nWe have now briefly sketched the Carboniferous system, for in our\r\nrecreations we can do little more. We shall find in many places in\r\nEngland tree trunks in the sandy shore, and ample evidence that a\r\nforest has been at one time submerged in that spot. So inland the land\r\nsank down again and again in successive periods—water, mud, soil,\r\nvegetable growth succeeded, to be again submerged and form a new coal\r\nseam for the use of man, who was destined to appear after the lapse of\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERMIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 669.—Impressions of feet of Cheirotherium].\r\n\r\nAt length the land remained undisturbed. It sank no more, and the trees\r\nwaved luxuriously over the buried forests of past ages, and another\r\ncycle set in called the PERMIAN, from the ancient kingdom of Permia,\r\nwhere all the features of that period are exhibited on a very grand\r\nscale, and which extended for several hundred miles between the Ural\r\nmountains and the Volga. In the Permian period we have the progression\r\nof animal life more distinctly developed than in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, which immediately preceded it. It is true there are indications\r\nin the latter that curious animals, called the Cheirotherium and the\r\nLabyrinthodon, were alive then, and the remains of numerous insects,\r\nsuch as beetles and crickets, have been found; but the Permian\r\ndeveloped them, and reptiles, saurians, and lizards have been traced;\r\nbut as Sir R. Murchison states, throughout the whole extent the animals\r\nare of a single type. We have the hand-like impressions of the feet\r\nof the Cheirotherium, so called from the Greek “cheir,” a hand. The\r\nsoil appears to have been very soft, and peculiarly adapted to receive\r\nimpressions, and which having been in many places covered over with\r\na stratum of fine sand, and then abandoned by the sea, the whole\r\nhas hardened into stone, and being now separated, the one contains\r\ntheir footprints, and the other perfect casts of them! Nor are these\r\nfootmarks all that these sandstones have to tell us of their day; for\r\nthe ripples of the waves, and even the little pits made by drops\r\nof rain as they fell, are in this most marvellous manner preserved,\r\nforming objects of wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe organic remains during this period are not very abundant, and many\r\nof the fauna of the previous systems appear to have died out, while\r\nothers appeared to meet with fuller development in succeeding ages. The\r\nPermian is also known as the New Red Sandstone, or Magnesian Limestone\r\ngroup. “Dias” has also been suggested with reference to the “Trias”\r\ngroup, “the Upper New Red Sandstone,” which comes next. The Permian\r\nrocks are very varied, and contain minerals, such as copper and sulphur.\r\n\r\nAs the strata below the new sandstone formation was called the\r\n“Carboniferous” system, from its containing much carbon in the\r\nform both of coal and carbonic acid, so this has been called the\r\n“Saliferous” system, from the occurrence in many places of strata\r\nof “rock-salt,” or crystallised chloride of sodium, and (where the\r\nrain finds its way down and dissolves it) of brine springs; these (in\r\nEngland) exist chiefly in Cheshire and Warwickshire, but in Poland and\r\nHungary they exist on a much larger scale, the rock-salt being nearly\r\na thousand feet thick. It has been said that these strata of salt were\r\nformed by the evaporation of salt lakes, but it is much more probable\r\nthat salt is one of the natural materials of the earth, and that both\r\nsalt lakes and oceans have become salt from dissolving out these strata\r\nwherever they have come into contact.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that during the Permian period the greater portion of\r\nthe continent of Europe was raised above the ocean, and the deposits\r\nwere formed in salt lakes, for the appearance of the organic remains\r\ntends to establish the fact that the creatures of that period were not\r\nfar from dry land even in their watery existence, and the reptiles\r\nfound confirm this view. We have now to examine the Mesozoic, or\r\nSecondary System.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dinotherium giganteum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n THE MESOZOIC SYSTEM—THE TRIASSIC, OOLITIC, AND CRETACEOUS\r\n FORMATIONS—THE EOCENE, MIOCENE, AND PLIOCENE—THE GLACIAL\r\n PERIOD—PRE-HISTORIC MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe trust that the general reader has gleaned from the foregoing chapter\r\nsome few ideas concerning the growth of plant and animal life in the\r\nearly periods of the world’s existence. From the Laurentian System\r\nwe have briefly traced the conformation of the globe at the dawn of\r\norganic life through the Silurian Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous\r\nformations, indicating as we proceeded the chief points in the world’s\r\nhistory, and the gradual development of life through many ages. There\r\nis no real or bold line of demarcation drawn between these systems. As\r\nseam unites to seam, and layer to layer, stratum upon stratum, so the\r\nsystems almost insensibly unite, and forms of life appear, mature, and\r\ndie away as the babe grows into the man, and dies away again to old age\r\nand final extinction. So one system merges into another, each and all\r\na factor in the great work which was intended to prepare the earth for\r\nthe greatest and latest development of Nature—MAN!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 670.—Fossils of the Trias Group.\r\n\r\n  1. Ammonites nodosus.\r\n  2. Avicula socialis.\r\n  3. Possidonia minuta.\r\n  4. Encrinites moniliformis.]\r\n\r\nBut all this while the earth had been, as it still is, undergoing\r\ncontinual change. Sometimes gradually, in the wearing away, or\r\nelevation of beach or headland; sometimes suddenly, as when mighty\r\nhills were upheaved and the deeply-laid granite or limestone was\r\nlifted to the summits of the mountains from the depths of the sea. Land\r\nand water came and went, and the ever-changing earth still brought\r\nforth abundantly “the herb yielding seed after its kind,” and the\r\n“moving things upon the ground after their kind,” ever improving and\r\ndeveloping till they culminated in the splendid vegetation and immense\r\nanimals of the Tertiary period, and lay silent afterwards in the cold\r\ngrasp of the great ice age for the thousands of years of the glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 671.—Plesiosaurus.]\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the TRIAS, or New (Upper) Red Sandstone, which is\r\ndivided into Upper and Lower Trias, “Keuper” and “Bunter.” We have\r\nthree principal headings in the Secondary System—the TRIASSIC (the\r\noldest), the OOLITIC, and the CRETACEOUS. In the first we find red\r\nsandstones and shelly limestone; in the second, clays and shale; in the\r\nlast, chalk, or white limestone. In some districts there are traces of\r\nvolcanic action.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the “Upper Trias,” or “Keuper” formation, we have the\r\nLias, which succeeds the Rhætic beds, and in this we find many rich\r\ntraces of reptiles and birds which come now before us in the rising\r\nscale of creation. In the seas of this period we have numerous\r\ncrustacea, the nautilus and the cuttle-fish. The _Saurians_ now come\r\nbefore our retrospective vision. It is the “Reptile Age” in all its\r\ndevelopment, and the huge labyrinthodon, the iguanodon, pterodactyle,\r\nand ichthyosaurus testify to the magnitude of the fauna of the period.\r\nThe first mammal specimen, a marsupial, has been traced back to this\r\ntime; and the tropical temperature was favourable for luxuriant\r\nvegetation, pines, and palms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 672.—Restorations of Saurians, etc.]\r\n\r\nIn the swamps or shallow waters the great reptiles disported\r\nthemselves, and seized their prey, the water-fowl, which now appeared\r\nin numbers, and of enormous size. Nor were insects absent. Numbers\r\nof remains have been discovered; beetles, dragon-flies, grasshoppers,\r\netc., in multitudes yield us information, while the marine fossils,\r\nstar-fish, mollusca, and various fishes, are of frequent occurrence.\r\nAnimal and vegetable life during this period must have been very rich\r\nand varied—literally leaving “footprints in the sands of time.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 673.—Pterodactylus longirostris.]\r\n\r\nThe “Blue Lias” is a term familiar to every reader. It is a kind of\r\nlimestone mixed with clay, of a blue colour, and upon this we find the\r\nOolitic, or Oolite System—so called because it somewhat resembles the\r\nroe of a fish. The Lias clays are used for bricks, and Whitby “jet” is\r\nalso obtained from the Upper Lias. Jet is really a lignite, or wood\r\nin the process of transmutation. In this Lias formation, besides the\r\nnumerous fossil remains already mentioned, we find the “snakestones”\r\n(ammonites), the stone-lily, and belemnites, with many nautili and\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 674.—Ichthyosaurus.]\r\n\r\nThe OOLITE, or JURASSIC, underlies the chalk, and overlies the Trias\r\nformation. The term “Jurassic” originates from the Jura range, which is\r\nalmost entirely composed of Oolitic strata. These strata are greatly\r\ndistorted by pressure, and when we reach Switzerland and the familiar\r\nAlps, we find gneiss, crystalline, limestones, and schists, into which\r\nthe Oolite has been metamorphosed. The Oolite is divided into Upper,\r\nMiddle, and Lower, consisting of the following:—\r\n\r\n                { Pembroke Beds.\r\n  Upper Oolite  { Portland “\r\n                { Kimmeridge Clay.\r\n\r\n                { Calcareous Grit.\r\n  Middle Oolite { Coral Rag.\r\n                { Oxford Clay.\r\n\r\n                { “Cornbrash”—Forest Marble.\r\n                { Stansfield Slate.\r\n  Lower Oolite  { Bath Oolite.\r\n                { Fuller’s Earth.\r\n                { Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 675.—Sketch-map of various geological formations.]\r\n\r\nThe Oolite formation (_see_ Map) occupies a stretch of country in\r\nEngland extending from Yorkshire into Dorset. The Great Oolite holds\r\nthe Fuller’s earth, and the Bath stone is also well known. The\r\nStonesfield slate holds many remains of reptiles. It is a kind of\r\nshelly limestone, and is used for roofing purposes. The Forest Marble\r\n(so called from Wychwood Forest) is a sandy limestone holding marine\r\nfossils. It is used for ornaments. The Coral Rag and Oxford clay are\r\nrich in fossils, and the former, as its name implies, is composed of\r\nancient coral reef. The Portland beds produce the well-known building\r\nstone. The Purbecks, of which there are three divisions, appear to have\r\nbeen deposited in fresh water, and occur in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nAll the Oolite strata supply organic remains. We have plants and ferns,\r\nreptiles, and a number of new genera of conchifera and cephalopods,\r\nstar-fish, urchins, and the enormous bats, and the terrible\r\nmegalosaurus, and the cetiosaurus, steneosaurus, and pliosaurus, of\r\nenormous size. One very remarkable bird has been found in the Bavarian\r\nlimestone of this period; it is called the Archæopteryx, which is\r\ndescribed as having a leg-bone and foot like the familiar birds, but\r\nthe tail is lizard-like, with feathers springing from each joint.\r\nSponges, corals, and fish, and many other forms of animal life are\r\nfound in the Oolites. The reptiles must have had it all their own way\r\nin this period, for there were both carnivorous and vegetable feeders,\r\nand teeth of the pliosaurus have been found which measure fifteen\r\ninches, the jaws being six feet long. We have seen that corals must\r\nhave built up their reefs in the waters, which then overlaid the land\r\nwe call the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThere must have been great changes during this period, and the strata\r\nare chiefly marine. The Wealden formations are the exceptions, and\r\nin the fresh-water deposits insect forms abound. The appearance and\r\nvariety of animal and vegetable life must have been curious and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe Weald or “Wold” of Kent is often spoken of, and it extends with the\r\nSurrey and Sussex Wealden formations for some distance. The strata are\r\nof fresh-water deposition, differing in this from the chalk, although\r\nthe Wealden beds are included in the Cretaceous Group, which is\r\ncomposed as follows:—\r\n\r\n        { Wealden.\r\n  Lower { Greensand.\r\n        { “Gault.”\r\n\r\n        { Upper Greensand.\r\n        { Chalk Marl.\r\n  Upper { Chalk (without Flint).\r\n        { Chalk (with Flint).\r\n        { Maestricht.\r\n\r\nThe “Wealden” formation is divided into Hastings sand and Weald\r\nclay. The former consists of clay and sandy beds, and is observable\r\nat Hastings, and in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge. The Weald clay\r\nconsists of blue and brown clays, with sandstone, and the limestone\r\nknown as “Sussex Marble,” which is formed by the _paludina_ of the\r\nrivers. There is another division often seen in Dorsetshire, and\r\ncalled the Punfield beds, which partake both of marine and fresh-water\r\nremains, which are distinct in the true Wealden and cretaceous\r\nformations, the former being of fresh, and the latter of salt-water\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe remains of enormous reptiles are numerous in the Wealden\r\nformations; crocodiles, lizards, turtles of gigantic size have been\r\ndiscovered, and most curious fossils have been disinterred in the\r\nHastings district. The “Greensands” are separated by what is termed\r\ngault, a stiff blue clay found in Norfolk, Essex, and Kent. The Lower\r\nGreensand includes the well-known Kentish rag, or limestone, of which\r\nso many churches are built. The Upper Greensand is supposed to be a\r\nseashore deposit on the sides of an extensive ocean or sea, at the\r\nbottom of which the chalk was formed. After the Wealden beds were\r\nformed, they were covered by these greensand estuary-beds, or littoral\r\nstrata. In these series new forms of life appeared, and the waters\r\nbecame the receptacle of myriads of mollusca, etc., which in time\r\nformed the great chalk cliffs and downs so often referred to. The chalk\r\nis interstratified with sand, which as “gault” and “greensand” was\r\nprobably the sand of the ocean bed before the chalk was formed upon\r\nit, and the seas must have supported many marine reptiles, for stony\r\n“nodules,” or coprolites, which are the fossil excreta of the animals,\r\nare found, and now used for manure, after being buried for thousands\r\nof years. Examination of these remains has resulted in the discovery\r\nof the teeth and bones of fish which had been devoured by the gigantic\r\nreptiles. An illustration of a shell thus discovered is annexed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 676.—Echinus (Hemicidarus intermedia, Chalk).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 677.—Nautilus Inequalis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 678.—Ammonite from the chalk.]\r\n\r\nWe have in a former chapter spoken of the chalk and its formation. We\r\nknow that it is composed of the minute foraminifera. The fossil remains\r\nare very numerous in chalk and all of a marine kind, such as the\r\nammonites, belemnites, and such cephalopods, and the echinus, bivalve\r\nmollusca, crustacea, etc. We have occasionally flints appearing in the\r\nchalk, and this circumstance has given rise to some speculation as to\r\nhow the flints got there, for they consist of nearly pure silica; and\r\nthe theory of the petrifaction of sponges, madrepores, etc., has been\r\nstarted to account for their presence. Dr. Carpenter says: “It may be\r\nstated, as a fact beyond all question, that nodular flint and other\r\nanalogous concretions (such as agates) may generally be considered\r\nas fossilised sponges or alcyonian zoophytes, since not only are\r\ntheir external forms and their superficial markings often highly\r\ncharacteristic of those organisms, but when sections of them are made\r\nsufficiently thin to be transparent, a spongy texture may be most\r\ndistinctly recognised in their interior.”\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that the decaying animal matter acts\r\nupon the silicious spiculæ of sponges, etc., and the silica is thus\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nWe may then surmise that at some very distant period the whole extent\r\nof the British Isles was submerged, as well as portions of the\r\ncontinent, and after the strata had been deposited the sea and land\r\nwere disturbed by volcanic action. While the secondary strata were\r\nbeing deposited, very little relative alteration took place, as the\r\ndeposits are seen to lie “conformably.” But when the great convulsion\r\nwhich upheaved the Apennines occurred, the chalk was raised as we find\r\nit in the cliffs and downs, which were the beds of seas. This is the\r\nlast of the great convulsions which the earth has undergone, for the\r\ntertiary strata, which afterwards began to be deposited, rest in the\r\nhollows or basins (chiefly in the chalk) then left; the alterations in\r\nand since these deposits appear to consist chiefly of the upheaval of\r\ncertain localities, the depression of others, the evaporation of inland\r\nlakes, and the wear and tear of the land from these causes, which are\r\nstill in continuous action (as from the washing down of cliffs by the\r\nsea, and the formation of mud deposits at the mouths of rivers), or the\r\nvolcanic agencies which in some places (as in Ireland) have cast up\r\nbasalt over the chalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 679.—Mosasaurus (Maestricht).]\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of transition formation which is classed with the\r\nCretaceous System, and termed “Maestricht,” after the town in Belgium.\r\nIt appears that this is an upper chalk layer, an intermediary between\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary, and here on the banks of the Meuse we find\r\nthe Mosasaurus, the “lizard of the Meuse,” of whose remains we give\r\nspecimens in the illustration. This transition chalk—as we may call it\r\nto distinguish it—must have been laid down at a later period than the\r\nflinty chalk, and we find it in many places. It serves therefore as a\r\nfitting introduction to the Tertiary Period of Geological time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon a period when the animal creation attained its\r\ngreatest development, the “Age of Mammals”; for they were then the\r\nkings of creation. The Tertiary Period is divided into three stages,\r\nviz.—\r\n\r\nThe EOCENE, or the Dawning of the now _existing_ creation.\r\n\r\nThe MIOCENE, or the Middle, or “minority” of existing creation.\r\n\r\nThe PLIOCENE, or the Recent, or still more developed period.\r\n\r\nWe will glance at them in that order, which Sir C. Lyell introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 680.—Skull of the Dinotherium.]\r\n\r\nThe Eocene formation is shown in what is termed the “London Basin,”\r\nhere illustrated by a section in which we find soft sands without\r\nfossils (Thanet Beds), and a kindred kind in Surrey, in which fossils\r\n(marine) are found. After these we get the “Reading and Woolwich”\r\nbeds as we ascend. These are of clay and pebbles, etc., with river\r\nfossils. The Oldhaven beds are included on the map; they occur towards\r\nBlackheath and Herne Bay. The London clay is very stiff, and in some\r\nplaces blue. It is full of fossils of birds, beasts, fruits, and\r\nvegetables, trees, reptiles, and fish, and the variety of the organic\r\nremains appears to indicate the fact that at one time the Thames flowed\r\nthrough swampy ground to the sea, in which dwelt, in a warm climate,\r\nimmense mammalia, such as the megatherium, glyptodon, tapir, etc., and\r\nsome turtles of enormous size.\r\n\r\nIt is also on record from late observations that these immense animals\r\nwere even mixed up, and almost fabulous creatures inhabited the land\r\nwhere England now is. We read of antelope-horses, lion-like bears,\r\nand camel-stags. The vegetation was then of a tropical kind, and\r\nin the deep forests and jungles these enormous animals—the mammoth\r\ndinotherium, and such species—roamed and plunged in the swamps at the\r\nmouth of the Thames. At length these types died away, and gave place to\r\nthe elephant and the hippopotamus, and the climate by degrees became\r\nless warm, and still slowly decreased in temperature.\r\n\r\nA glance at Sir C. Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” will show us how,\r\nas we examine the more modern strata, we find a great increase in the\r\nEuropean lands, which may have been compensated by the submersion\r\nof the Pacific islands. During the period of the vegetation of the\r\nSecondary epochs, our climate (between the lias and the chalk) was\r\nfavourable to a tropical growth. Enormous rivers flowed through our\r\nislands, and gigantic crocodiles, etc., with flying reptiles, were\r\nmasters of the land. There were numerous fishes, but the reptiles did\r\nnot appear in such very great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 681.—Section across the London Basin (W. Whitaker).\r\n\r\n  _a_ Lower Bagshot sand (of Hampstead).\r\n  _b_ London Clay.\r\n  _c_ Reading and Woolwich beds (including the Oldhaven beds, which\r\n      occur in the south only).\r\n  _d_ Thanet sand (crops out on the south only).\r\n  _e_ Chalk with flints.\r\n  _f_ Chalk without flints.\r\n  _g_ Upper Greensand (crops out on the south only).\r\n  _h_ Gault.\r\n  _i_ Lower Greensand.\r\n  _k_ Wealden beds (on the south only).\r\n  _l_ Oolitic clays (shown only on the north, but proved to occur on the\r\n      south beyond the range of the section, by the sub-Wealden boring,\r\n      near Battle, in Sussex).\r\n  x Old rocks, shown by borings at Kentish Town and at Meux’s Brewery,\r\n      to pass under the London basin.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nThese large and elephantine animals must have existed while the climate\r\nof Northern Europe underwent some very considerable changes. We read\r\nof the woolly rhinoceros, and the hairy elephant, or mastodon, which\r\nhas been found in Siberia. Reindeer appeared in England, and we know\r\nnow that these animals inhabit cold countries. The mountains were\r\nconsiderably elevated during the latter Tertiary period; snow fell and\r\nice formed upon the summits of the mountains, while glaciers crept down\r\nthe sides. The warm, almost tropical climate of the prior ages was\r\ngradually but surely giving way to the Ice Age; the earth was slowly\r\ndipping, and the sun’s rays had less power.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay says the “assemblage of fossils found in the London\r\nclay point to the fact that the whole of these strata were deposited in\r\nthe estuary of a great continental river comparable to the Amazon and\r\nthe Ganges. The palm-nuts and the host of other plants help to prove\r\nit, and the remains of river tortoises, crocodiles, snakes, marsupials,\r\nand several tapir-like mammals, all point in the same direction. The\r\nestuarine conditions begun during the deposit of the Woolwich and\r\nReading beds were still going on when the London clay was thrown down;\r\nwith this difference, that by sinking of the area the estuary had\r\nbecome longer, wider, and deeper, but still remained connected with a\r\nvast continent, through which the Eocene river flowed.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 682.—Anoplotherium commune: palæotherium magnum and\r\nminus; and crocodile.]\r\n\r\nThe Miocene deposits are not so generally important in the United\r\nKingdom, but in America very valuable fossils have been discovered\r\nin these strata. The Pliocene strata extend along the east of Great\r\nBritain, where they are denominated “Crag,” as Norfolk Crag, Red\r\nCrag, Coralline Crag. Underneath these mammalian remains have been\r\ndiscovered. After the Pliocene we come to the Post-Pliocene, which\r\nreally closes the long Tertiary period. During these ages the gradual\r\ndevelopment of created beings apparently reached its height. It was\r\ntowards the end of the Middle Eocene that the great mountain chain\r\nof Europe came into existence, which is connected, as any casual\r\nobserver may see, with the Himalaya. In fact, the whole chain, from the\r\nThibetian range through India, the Caucasus, Alps, and Pyrenees, is\r\ncontinuous, and formed of the same material (“nummulitic limestone”).\r\nThere is no doubt that the whole northern hemisphere enjoyed at the\r\ncommencement of the Tertiary period a warm, not to say tropical,\r\nclimate, which got colder and colder.\r\n\r\nWe find the increase of animals and plants more fitted to the\r\nrequirements of man and our present climate. There are many signs of\r\nthe successive increase of land in Europe generally, while the contrast\r\nthe Tertiary period bears to the Secondary is very marked. In the\r\nformer we have extensive deposits in the waters of wide, open seas; in\r\nthe latter the depositions were evidently made where dry land, with its\r\naccompanying bays and lakes, were extensive and numerous. The former\r\nis marine, the latter lacustrine and marine. The seas of the Tertiary\r\nperiod have lately been defined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 683.—Megatherium cuvieri (_post-Pliocene_), S.\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his “Principles of Geology,” shows us this, and\r\ndefines the European features at the commencement of the Tertiary\r\nepoch. At that time, the British islands, with the exception of the\r\nbasins of London, the Isle of Wight, and Norfolk, had wholly emerged\r\nfrom the deep. But a third part of France was still under water.\r\nItaly consisted only of a long and narrow ridgy peninsula, branching\r\noff from the Alps near Savona. Turkey and Greece, south of the Danube,\r\nwere laid dry; and a tract of land extended from the Vosges, through\r\ncentral Germany, Bohemia, and the north of Hungary, perhaps to the\r\nBalkan. But the whole of the north of Europe and Asia, from Holland\r\neastward to central Tartary, and from Saxony and the Carpathians\r\nnorthward to Sweden, Lapland, and the Ural chain, lay beneath the\r\nocean. The same subterranean movements, which have subsequently raised\r\nthe wide plains of our northern continents above the sea-level, have\r\ngiven great additional elevation to the then existing land. Thus the\r\nAlps have certainly acquired an increased height of from two thousand\r\nto four thousand feet since the commencement of the Tertiary period.\r\nThe Pyrenees, whose highest ridge consists of marine calcareous beds,\r\nof the age of our chalk and greensand series, while the Tertiary\r\nstrata at their foot are horizontal, and reach only the height of a\r\nfew hundred feet above the sea, seem to have been entirely upheaved in\r\nthe comparatively brief interval between the deposition of the chalk\r\nand these Tertiary strata. The Jura, also, owe a great part of their\r\npresent elevation to convulsions which happened after the deposition\r\nof the Tertiary groups. On the other hand, it is possible that some\r\nmountain-chains may have been lowered by subsidence, as well as by\r\nmeteoric degradation, during the same series of ages in this quarter\r\nof the globe; and on some points shallows may have been depressed\r\ninto deep abysses. But, on the whole, everything tends to show that\r\nthe great predominance of land which now distinguishes the northern\r\nhemisphere has been brought about only at a recent period, and Sir\r\nCharles holds that the shifting of the continents is sufficient to\r\naccount for the variations of climate. We have every reason to believe\r\nthat before the Glacial epoch England and the Continent were united,\r\nand during the Glacial period England and North America were joined,\r\nviâ Greenland and Ireland. Mr. Dawkins says that England at that time\r\nwas six hundred feet above its present level. If so—and we cannot\r\nquestion his conclusions—the Channel was then dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 684.—Cervus Megaceros (_Megaceros Hibernicus_):\r\nIrish Elk.—Post-Pliocene.]\r\n\r\nThe “Great Ice Age” then came upon the world. For the information of\r\nreaders who wish to peruse the whole history of this epoch and its\r\ncauses, we may add that in Professor Geikie’s most interesting work,\r\nthey will find full details. We can only refer to it.\r\n\r\nThe gradual decrease of temperature upon the earth, which was the cause\r\nof the Glacial period extending over the north of Europe, has been\r\nattributed to the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit; and here astronomy\r\nsteps in to our assistance. We have read in the chapters on Astronomy,\r\nhow the movement of the earth, like a top near the end of its “spin,”\r\ncauses the “precession of the equinoxes,” and in connection with this\r\nphenomenon the earth’s orbit becomes more and more circular at certain\r\nperiods of thousands of years, and goes away from the sun. We therefore\r\nreceive the light and heat at a greater angle. Consequently, less heat\r\nis received, and ice is formed, as at the North and South Poles at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 685.—Drift Ice.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Croll has pointed out that the great eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit existed about 210,000 years ago, when there was a difference\r\nbetween the nearest and farthest position of the earth and the sun\r\nof 12,000,000 of miles at least.[28] This is a very considerable\r\ndistance even in the enormous spaces which intervene between us and\r\nthe other planets of the solar system, and about that time the Glacial\r\nperiod arrived. Perhaps we may make this clearer by going back to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe earth moves in an orbit called an ellipse, and the sun is not in\r\nthe centre of this nearly circular path. We can now understand that\r\nthe earth comes nearer to the sun sometimes and recedes at others.\r\nThese points of nearest approach and greatest distance are termed\r\n_perihelion_ and _aphelion_. In the latter case we are about 9,000,000\r\nof miles farther from the sun than when in perihelion—that is, when\r\nthe greatest “eccentricity” is reached. In addition to this the\r\naxis of the earth is continually changing in direction by reason of\r\nsolar attraction at the equator. This shifting, as explained in the\r\nastronomical section, is very slight every year, and in the course of\r\n24,000 years the conditions of the seasons will have completely changed\r\nround and back again,—for the northern and southern conditions will be\r\nreversed in our hemisphere. Day and night come twenty minutes earlier\r\nevery year. We are now nearer the sun in winter as shown in diagram\r\n(page 497); when we change we shall be nearest the sun in summer and\r\nfarthest in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 686.—The Mer de Glace.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Croll, who has done much in his most interesting paper on\r\nchanges of climate[29], tells us how this eccentricity of the earth’s\r\norbit produced indirectly the Glacial epoch. He shows how, if in a\r\nperiod of the greatest “eccentricity” our winter came in aphelion, we\r\nshould receive one-fifth less heat than now, but a correspondingly\r\ngreater heat in summer. But if our winter under such circumstances fall\r\n(as now) in perihelion, the difference between winter and summer would\r\nbe practically _nil_, because the sun during a period of the earth’s\r\ngreat eccentricity “could not warm the hemisphere whose summer happened\r\nto arrive in perihelion.” No doubt the sun’s rays would be very\r\npowerful, but the earth being covered with ice and snow could not be\r\nwarmed; fogs would accrue and hide the sun, as at present in Antarctic\r\nsummers, when the cold is very great. The warm ocean currents would\r\nbe stopped, and the northern portion of our hemisphere would be, as it\r\nundoubtedly was, frozen over and covered with snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 687.—Mammoth and Irish Elk.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the millions of years since the earth is supposed to\r\nhave been launched into space, we can imagine that the Glacial periods\r\nwould occur frequently, and considering the very slow “precession”\r\nmovement there, and the alternating tropical climate with graduations\r\nof temperature for thousands of years they would last long. The great\r\nGlacial period is computed to have begun 240,000 years ago and lasted\r\n160,000 years with alternations of comparative summer; and so the years\r\nwent on, season succeeding season, altering the appearance of the\r\nearth, and causing successive changes in the distribution of animal and\r\nvegetable life. Then the great mammalia, the mammoth and hippopotamus,\r\nwith the hyæna, lion, and other felidæ came, and went when Arctic\r\nanimals usurped their places. At the later Glacial epoch man must have\r\narrived in Britain, and “this being so,” says Professor Geikie, “it is\r\nstartling to recall in imagination those grand geological revolutions\r\nof which he must have been a witness.... He entered Britain at a time\r\nwhen our country was joined to Europe across the bed of the German\r\nOcean; at a time when the winters were still severe enough to freeze\r\nover the rivers in the south of England; at a time when glaciers\r\nnestled in our upland and mountain valleys, and the Arctic mammalia\r\noccupied the land. He lived here long enough to witness a complete\r\nchange of climate, to see the Arctic mammalia vanish from England, and\r\nthe hippopotamus and its congeners take their places. At a later date,\r\nand while a mild and genial climate still continued, he beheld the sea\r\nslowly gain upon the land, until, little by little, step by step, a\r\nlarge portion of our country was submerged—a submergence which, as we\r\nknow, reached in Wales to the extent of 1,300 feet or thereabouts.”\r\n\r\nWe find that the land underwent many subsequent changes; it rose from\r\nthe sea, was again covered with ice, and many parts of Europe were\r\ndevastated by immense glaciers—that of the Rhone extending for more\r\nthan two hundred miles. Then came vegetation as the ice gave way, and\r\nluxuriance of the tropics reigned; more cold after that, then more\r\nheat, till the ice was finally driven to its mountain fastnesses, and\r\n“Britain for the last time became continental. Neolithic man came\r\nupon the scene; his palæolithic predecessor had, as far as Britain\r\nand northern Europe are concerned, vanished for ever.” The inquiry\r\nrespecting the arrival and presence of man in Britain would lead us too\r\nfar in pursuit. The fact has been established that man was living in\r\nthe Thames valley while tropical animals were in the country, and he\r\nhas been classed by Professor Boyd-Dawkins amongst the mid-pleistocene\r\nmammalia, and at that distant period, man as man, and not as an\r\nintermediate form connecting the human race with the lower animals, was\r\npresent in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe stone implements which have been found in river beds and in\r\ncaverns, associated with the bones of various animals, such as the\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, hyæna, bear, and others prove this. These very\r\nancient and rudely-fashioned implements have been divided into two\r\nclasses, the Palæolithic and the Neolithic, by Sir John Lubbock. First\r\nthe stone implements were used, and stone was superseded by bronze and\r\niron. Then we come to the historic period. In the neolithic period\r\nwe find stone implements in the lake dwellings of Switzerland and\r\nConstance (as well as the Lake of Neuchatel), all of which have lately\r\ndeveloped many treasures. Bronze tools have also been found, and so the\r\ngradual progress of man as a fashioner of weapons can be traced from\r\nage to age.\r\n\r\nFrom the “river-drift” man we descend to the cave-man, who is supposed\r\nto have been identical with the Esquimaux. When Britain became an\r\nisland the cave-man seems to have disappeared from our country, and in\r\nthe prehistoric age the earliest of the present inhabitants came here,\r\nand brought with them domestic animals; then the Celts of the bronze\r\nage, and then the iron. The wild beasts gradually disappeared, and\r\ndomestic ones occupied their places under civilized conditions.[30]\r\n\r\nSo we come from the “Glacial period” to the open door of history\r\nthrough the antechamber of the prehistoric time.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric is the arbitrary division between the post-pliocene or\r\npleistocene and the known “historic” periods of the world’s history,\r\nand we must dismiss it with a few general remarks, for the changes\r\nwhich we have attempted to follow are still taking place in the earth;\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes are unsettling the strata, and adding to the\r\nphysical and geographical record which will some day have to be written\r\nby posterity and future geologists. We can see in those prehistoric\r\ntimes traces of men (hunters and fishers) existing with difficulty,\r\nmayhap, in the midst of enormous quadrupeds, and fighting for existence\r\nwith the bears and many other formidable foes. We have noticed the\r\nstone ages, the rough and the smooth as they may be called, and we can\r\npicture the primitive agriculture and work of the neolithic man. But\r\nit is by no means to be believed that neolithic man in Britain was a\r\nrace all over the world. We may assume that in eastern climes the human\r\nrace were in a more civilized condition as improvements made their way\r\nslowly westward. Our island history commences in the time of Julius\r\nCæsar. Eastern chronicles go back many thousands of years farther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 688.—Carboniferous Flora.]\r\n\r\nIt is so short a time, geologically speaking, since man appeared within\r\nthe limits of history, that the earth’s changes, except from direct\r\nvolcanic action or water erosion, are very trifling. The change is, as\r\nwe said, continually proceeding; ceaselessly the earth is wearing away,\r\nand depositing her riches where she is undisturbed by civilization and\r\nman’s excavations and intrusions. The rock is worn by water; the grit\r\nis carried down and deposited to form sedimentary rocks as of old; the\r\nlime will continue to assist the coral to be built up; and the chalk\r\ncliffs will be born under the sea, and our organic remains shall be\r\nfound to tell remote ages that we were an enlightened people. For all\r\nwe can tell, and it is by no means unlikely another recurring cycle of\r\nArctic and Tropical periods will in time pass over our earth; the bear\r\nand reindeer, the hippopotamus and the rhinoceros, may again inhabit\r\nour islands. If our generation be destroyed, the purely animal creation\r\nwith the vegetable world will reign over the land, and new forests\r\nwill deposit new coal measures for the support and comfort of a new\r\ngeneration of highly organized beings, when our remains shall have\r\npassed away to the borders of a “prehistoric” age.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing brief sketch how the world has arrived at\r\nits present beautiful condition,—how it has been step by step prepared\r\nfor us, how nature’s forces have been and are still working according\r\nto the immutable laws of the Universe. And, after all, how little we\r\nknow! What scraps of intelligence only are we able to gather up from\r\nthe boundless quantity of material which must have been laid down, yet\r\nwhat wondrous results scientists have been able to adduce from even\r\nthese comparatively scanty specimens! The sea and land are ever telling\r\nus the same old story. Man’s research and Bible teaching are found hand\r\nin hand in cordial and reverent agreement. Nothing is altered since\r\nthe day that the Divine command, “Let there be light,” went forth into\r\nspace, and till the earth be destroyed the same forces will continue in\r\noperation, guided by the Hand that made it—“ever faithful, ever sure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] It might reach 14,000,000 of miles at a maximum.\r\n\r\n[29] “Physical Causes of Change of Climate,” _Phil. Mag._, 1864.\r\n\r\n[30] See Dawkins’ “Early Man in Britain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n IGNEOUS ROCKS—LAND AND WATER—SPRINGS, WELLS, AND GEYSERS—SNOW AND\r\n ICE—THEIR EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages we have chiefly considered the stratified\r\nrocks, but we are now approaching another branch of our subject—viz.,\r\n“Physiography,” which, as distinguished from the usual so-called\r\nPhysical Geography, will deal with the phenomena of the earth, air, and\r\nwater, thus leading us to Meteorology as a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at a certain knowledge concerning the Earth as a\r\nplanet, her place in the universe, and the composition of the “Crust,”\r\nas it is termed. We have examined the stratified rocks, which include\r\nsand and gravel, stones, and boulders equally. To a geologist they\r\nare all “rocks.” We must now examine the igneous rocks, which bear an\r\nimportant part in the structure of the Earth, whose surface we have\r\nnow more minutely to examine. It has already been stated (p. 571) that\r\nigneous rocks have been upheaved while in a state of fusion—that is,\r\nwhile in a melted condition. These igneous, or fire-produced rocks,\r\nare divided into classes, just as the unstratified rocks are, and the\r\ndivisions are called the VOLCANIC and PLUTONIC, including “Basic” and\r\n“Acidic,” according as they are possessed of less silica or more.\r\n\r\nSometimes the igneous rocks are classed as volcanic, trappean (from\r\n_trappa_, a stair, such as in the Giant’s Causeway), and granitic.\r\nThe volcanic in such case being the modern or upper rocks, such as\r\nlava, scoria, etc., which, having been cast up by volcanoes, are of\r\ncomparatively recent formation.\r\n\r\nThe VOLCANIC rocks, then, are of recent date, _comparatively_ speaking;\r\nthey form the constituent portions of the volcanoes of the present day,\r\nand are found as basaltic formations. They are traced as far back as\r\nthe Tertiary period of the globe. Amongst the volcanic rocks we find\r\nbasalt, augite, porphyry, serpentine, pumice, pitchstone, felspar, etc.\r\nBut no doubt volcanic action has been going on ever since the beginning\r\nof the world as it is now, and will continue to do. It is somewhat\r\ncurious that the very old igneous rocks should not be more evident.\r\n\r\nThe PLUTONIC rocks do not differ essentially from the foregoing. There\r\nis less quartz and more hornblende; and if the ages during which these\r\nformations have been existent in the earth-depths after they became\r\nsolidified be considered, the differences will be fully accounted for.\r\nThe greenstones and syenites are prominent amongst the plutonic series.\r\n\r\nThese plutonic and volcanic rocks are separated into basic and acidic,\r\nas already remarked, but the line cannot be drawn very distinctly.\r\nGranite is the chief plutonic (acidic) rock, and we frequently find it\r\nforced upwards into other strata, its essentially eruptive character\r\nbeing thus decided. That granite must have taken an immense time to\r\nsolidify and crystallize is evident, for no new granites are ever\r\nfound. We find granite in all the _old_ mountain chains—such as the\r\nGrampians in Scotland, and the Wicklow mountains. Our chief European\r\n(active) volcanoes are, so to speak, modern, as may be supposed when\r\ntheir constituents are known. It may be said that granite was first\r\ndeposited as sediment heated by subterranean fire, and forced up by\r\nthermal action of water to the mountains, where it is uncovered by a\r\nslow process of denudation and surface washings of the earth.\r\n\r\nNow without at present going any farther into the causes of volcanoes\r\nwe can see at a glance that the eruption of the igneous rocks must have\r\ncreated a marked and essential difference in the physical geography\r\nof the globe. It is to these eruptions that the dislocation and\r\ndisturbance of the stratified formations are due. The igneous rocks\r\npresent ridges in the mountains; sometimes they are rounded at the\r\nsummits, while the aqueous and metamorphic rocks are disposed in layers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 689.—Crater of Popocatapetl.]\r\n\r\nThese two classes in their varieties form the land and the crust of the\r\nearth, which is ever being acted upon by air and water. The ice, again,\r\npolishes and scratches the valleys in which it moves. The loosened\r\nboulders that tumble from the mountains are carried down by the ice,\r\nand deposited in the glacier moraine, whence flows a stream. By degrees\r\nthe stone is ground up, and carried away in the water to form sediment\r\nin a “delta” at the _embouchure_, or to lie beneath the surface and\r\nform rock once more. The igneous rocks, composed of lavas and ashes,\r\nare volcanic rocks, deposited deep down, and then after the lapse of\r\nages disclosed by the action of air and water.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the land and water upon the globe shows us that\r\nthey are distributed over the earth very unequally. There is nearly\r\nthree times as much water in our planet as there is land, and these\r\nproportions could not be altered without giving rise to phenomena, the\r\nresults of which cannot be properly estimated. Our earth has an area\r\nof 197,000,000 of square miles; about 52,000,000 of this is land, and\r\nabout 145,000,000 of it water; so about three-quarters of the globe is\r\nmade up of water. The first portion of our subject therefore should\r\nbe directed to the examination and consideration of water, and the\r\nphenomena which arise from its presence upon the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 690.—Distribution of land and water.]\r\n\r\nWe need not go into details which every geography indicates. We will\r\ntry to trace the _sources_, not the _plain effects_, which all can\r\nafterwards study from special books. In a preceding portion of this\r\nvolume we have explained the chemical composition of water, and we\r\nshowed by experiment that it is a fluid composed of oxygen and hydrogen\r\ngases, in the proportions of one to two volumes respectively. No matter\r\nin what form water may appear,—as water, as ice, or as steam,—these\r\nproportions never vary in pure water (_see_ p. 352). But water on\r\nthe earth is seldom, or never, pure. We know the difficulty we have\r\nto procure good drinking water, and though it may be filtered, there\r\nwill remain natural salts, which are found in different degrees in\r\nall water upon the globe. We know the rain, which is perfectly pure\r\nwhen condensed from the clouds, absorbs carbonic acid, etc., from the\r\natmosphere. We have shown how this water as soon as it comes upon the\r\nearth attacks the rocks, and as it progresses carries away lime. After\r\ndescending deep down, it rises again in the form of SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nNow what are these springs? They are the result of percolation of\r\nrain-water through certain strata. When water falls it is absorbed\r\ninto the ground, unless it happens to rest upon an impermeable rock,\r\nin which case it becomes a rivulet. But it can penetrate between the\r\natoms of many rocks, and thus falls through sand and harder rocks, till\r\nit reaches a stratum which will not receive it—like clay. We then find\r\nthat it will flow away in a spring, or if tapped will be an Artesian\r\nwell. These water-wells are of very ancient date, but the name is more\r\nmodern.[31] The springs flow out, and develop, with the assistance of\r\ntributaries, into rivers. These again receive more tributaries, which\r\nswell the volume of their waters, and widen out, carrying millions of\r\ngallons hourly to the sea with sediment and gravel and stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 691.—Distribution of land and water.]\r\n\r\nWater has enormous power of disintegration. We have only to cast our\r\neyes upon the illustrations in any volume of continental travel in\r\nEurope or America to perceive the gorges and cañons worn out by the\r\nresistless and frequently gently-flowing river to estimate the part\r\nwhich water plays in Physical Geography and Meteorology.\r\n\r\nBut springs occur not only in the case mentioned; there are mineral\r\nsprings, hot springs, and oil springs, all following the same rules\r\nof nature. The Artesian well has been mentioned. The Geysers of\r\nIceland have often been portrayed, and are amongst the most wonderful\r\nphenomena of nature. These will serve as a type of the other thermal\r\nsprings, of which the districts of the Yellowstone in North America\r\nafford perhaps the most extraordinary instances. These are intermittent\r\nsprings, and the water rises to a great height, at intervals of about\r\nan hour and a half; and after many successive attempts, or trials, as\r\nit were, the geyser shoots up to a great height enveloped in steam.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these well-known phenomena have been explained by Bunsen,\r\nand it has already been referred to. We know that at a certain\r\nair-pressure water boils at 212° (Fahr.), but on mountains at less\r\npressure it will boil before that degree, because the air is rarefied.\r\nSo conversely, under the ground, it may reach 212° without boiling. So\r\nthe surface (warm) water falls, and reaches a high temperature before\r\nit is converted into steam. When it is so converted, the vapour is\r\nformed very rapidly, and the expansive force is tremendous, shooting up\r\nthe water and all the contents of the tube with terrific violence, and\r\nwith a beautiful effect. Pressure therefore alters the boiling point of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 692.—Geyser of the Yellowstone.]\r\n\r\nThe mineral springs of Bath and many continental towns owe their\r\nproperties to the solvent power of water, which assimilates the mineral\r\natoms and gases. They arise just in the same way as the ordinary\r\nspring, the taste and smell depending upon the soil and strata. Perhaps\r\nthe oil wells are the most curious phenomena of this kind. They are\r\nexcavated upon the Artesian principle. The petroleum is bored for,\r\nas we bore for water, and the oil rushes up with great force, and in\r\nenormous quantities. Gas wells are also to be found in Pennsylvania,\r\nand have supplied towns with gas for years. Both these Artesian\r\nwells are caused by the decay of vegetation. The gas is in the coal\r\nformation, and the oil has been pressed out from vegetable deposit,\r\nand as anthracite is a stony coal, petroleum is a kind of coal-tar, of\r\nnatural formation.\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the river, which emerges from the spring, which has\r\nfallen as rain. But there is another, and, to many minds, a much more\r\ninteresting form of the universal fluid we call water. This is ice.\r\nFamiliar as ice is, either to the stay-at-home invalid, the skater,\r\nand the traveller, there is a great deal to be said about it. It is a\r\nsubject we would dwell upon had we space, for the remembrance of many\r\na pleasant hour passed upon snow and glacier call upon us to go back\r\nagain, even though only in imagination. No one who has not climbed\r\nthe glacier—even the Mer de Glace to the _Jardin_, now such a common\r\nexcursion—can fail to be struck with the beauty and grandeur of the\r\nscene presented to him, and to carry away a fond recollection of the\r\nicy regions he penetrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 693.—Colorado Cañon (effects of water erosion).]\r\n\r\nFor the ordinary hard-working man there is no change, no rest so truly\r\nbeneficial as a trip amongst the mountains and snowfields of Europe.\r\nHe need not be a climber; that is, a climber like Tyndall or Whymper,\r\nthose giants of the Alpine Club. But a stroll up to the Bel Alp, the\r\nÆggishhorn, the Riffel, the Montanvert, or the Grimsel, will give the\r\naverage pedestrian some of the finest glacier scenery in Europe, and\r\nwhich may, we believe, compare with any in the world for beauty. These\r\nglaciers—ice-rivers—we will now consider briefly. We may take the _Mer\r\nde Glace_ as an example (_see_ the illustration, p. 596). That gives\r\nus a very fair idea of the ice-river, but the cut below is a good\r\nspecimen of a glacier.\r\n\r\nSuppose we start up from Chamouni, or come across from Argentières, we\r\nshall reach the Montanvert by ascending through the wood, or by the\r\n“Chapeau,” across the ice-sea. As we take the former course, we walk\r\nalongside a white-flowing and rapid river, the Arve, which unites with\r\nthe Rhone below Geneva. This river divides, and if we keep alongside\r\none (the right or south branch), we shall reach the moraine and the\r\nicy grotto, from which the water issues. It is in this way many large\r\nrivers are born. The Rhine, the Rhone, the Aar, the Ticino, have all of\r\nthem their sources in the ice. The Visp and the Sass waters are other\r\nalmost equally well-known examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 694.—Source of the Rhine.]\r\n\r\nThere used to be a grotto or cavern, into which the tourist could enter\r\nat the source of the Arveiron, and here the beautiful blue of the ice\r\ncould be studied. From this place the Chapeau is reached, up a stony\r\npath amid the trees, and from the top outside the hut we can see\r\nthe Mer de Glace all broken and contorted. The frequently occurring\r\nroar of a falling rock which heat has deprived of its icy support,\r\nor the cracking and tumbling of ice-blocks, may be seen and heard in\r\nthe forenoon. But the grandeur and majesty of the ice and snow-clad\r\nmountains is best enjoyed by moonlight.\r\n\r\nOn the ice we shall see huge stones and gravel and grit, which have\r\nbeen carried down by the ever-moving glacier, which is denuded in its\r\ncourse, and worn down upon the surface as it slides, scraping and\r\ngrinding the valley through which it flows. By passing along a path\r\nnow made easy by irons, but formerly without supports or guards, the\r\nsurface of the glacier will be reached, and a man with a hatchet will\r\ncut steps for the timid traveller. We are now upon the deep ice-river,\r\nwhich has its springs in the snowy regions of the Col de Géant, in the\r\nsnow which is continually falling upon the heights, and draining away\r\nto water again to form a river.\r\n\r\nThus the circle of events is completed,—snow, _névé_, ice (glacier),\r\nwater, which last is again absorbed into the atmosphere, and again\r\ndescends as rain or snow. And this is always going on by the action of\r\nthe sun. It may here fairly be asked how snow becomes ice. Why does\r\nnot the snow turn into ice at once, and form a glacier at the top of\r\nthe mountain as well as at the bottom? We will endeavour to make this\r\nclear. Snow is composed of crystals, which assume certain definite\r\nforms, and when first the flakes fall they are soft and powdery. By\r\ndegrees they melt a little, and when unconsolidated form what is termed\r\n_névé_, the border line between ice and snow. This semi-icy snow\r\ndescends under pressure, and, as it increases, the glacier is formed\r\nby huge blocks and masses being pressed together on the steep slopes\r\nof the mountains. Thus the glacier descends, rounding off rocks, and\r\nscouring as it goes, moving at a certain estimated rate daily,—about\r\ntwenty inches on the average,—carrying stones and _débris_ which form\r\nthe moraine, and finally when the high temperature in the valley melts\r\nthe ice, it issues forth as a river into the plain, or bounds down the\r\nmountain side in a cascade. An excursion—and one by no means dangerous\r\nif a guide be taken—to the _Jardin_, near Chamouni, will reveal\r\nmany interesting features of glacier formation, and of the glaciers\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 695.—Glacier table.]\r\n\r\nPhysical Geography is therefore very much indebted to the action of\r\nwater as a fluid or as a solid. In the former condition it erodes the\r\nrocks, carries down the stones and gravel and sand, forms deltas at\r\nthe mouths of rivers, and elevates plains by overflowing its banks\r\nand depositing sediment. Water gives beautiful scenery, and the\r\never-changing features of the landscape are due to it. From the time\r\nthe spring emerges to the time when it has developed into a river,\r\nbearing fine ships upon its restless waters, the universal fluid is\r\nalways at its work of destruction and benefit combined. From the limpid\r\nstream we pass to the salt ocean, the reservoir of all the waters of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 696.—Life under water.]\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter briefly considered two very important forces\r\nwhich have much to do with the varying conformation of the earth—viz.,\r\nfire and water in their results of volcanic action and erosion. The sea\r\nwill tell us something more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] From Artois, where the first European well of this kind existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA AND THE SKY.\r\n\r\n THE SEA—SALT WATER—WAVES AND THEIR EFFECTS—UNDER WATER—THE FLOOR OF THE\r\n OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our childhood the sea has been the companion and playmate of\r\nthousands, the seashore their playground. Men have selected it for\r\ntheir professional training and livelihood. Authors write of it, poets\r\napostrophize, scientists lecture upon it, and fathom it, bringing\r\nup from its depths many a new fact and illustration for those who\r\ncannot study it for themselves. There is nothing like it, nothing more\r\nmajestic, more beautiful, more life-giving than the ocean—nothing so\r\nchangeable nor so true.\r\n\r\nFrom the days when we could toddle along the beach, picking up the\r\nshells, we have wondered at the ocean—What was beyond it? What did it\r\nconceal?\r\n\r\n    “What hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells,\r\n      Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main?”\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to find out.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us is the _saltness_ of the sea. Sea\r\nwater is salt. Why? One reason is because salts are carried into it by\r\nrivers, and besides, it is more beneficial as salt water. But let us\r\nlook at the facts. We know that the earth contains many “salts,” as\r\nwe can see by the saline springs. We have already given the chemical\r\nconstitution of sea water, but it will be useful to repeat the\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n  Water                                                  964·74372 grains.\r\n  Salt (Chloride of Sodium)                               28·05948   ”\r\n  Chloride of Potassium                                    0·76552   ”\r\n  Chloride of Magnesium                                    3·66658   ”\r\n  Bromide of Magnesium                                     0·02929   ”\r\n  Sulphate of Magnesia                                     2·29578   ”\r\n  Sulphate of Lime                                         0·40662   ”\r\n  Carbonate of Lime (with traces of Iodine and Ammonia)    0·03301   ”\r\n                                                        ----------\r\n                                                        1000·00000   ”\r\n                                                        ----------\r\n\r\nSome portions of the sea are not so salt as others, or, in other words,\r\nnot so dense, and the saltness of the water prevents it being frozen so\r\nquickly as fresh water, which freezes at 32°. Salt water requires to\r\nbe reduced to 28° before it freezes. Besides the various constituents\r\nmentioned above, sea water has been found to contain boron, bromine,\r\nstrontia, etc., and even silver, for the copper of ships has been found\r\nto be impregnated with that metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 697.—Going out.]\r\n\r\nIf there is so much salt in the sea, it may be asked, why does it not\r\ncontinually become greatly saltier by additions. The reason is because\r\ntons of fresh water are continually pouring in, and though we can\r\nscarcely doubt that the sea is becoming gradually more salt as years\r\npass away, the increase is very slight. On the other hand, evaporation\r\nis carrying water into the air and leaving the salt behind it. In seas\r\nlike the Red Sea, where there is a great deal of evaporation and very\r\nlittle addition of fresh water in comparison, the water is extremely\r\nsalt and bitter. The Baltic has little salt relatively to some parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nSupposing that, as some allege, there are rocks of salt at the bottom\r\nof the sea, we must remember that springs of fresh water frequently\r\nbubble up to the surface of the ocean. This is a very curious\r\nphenomenon, and has been attested by Humboldt. He states that near Cuba\r\nthese springs arise with considerable force, and the vessels trading on\r\nthat coast get supplies of fresh water from these ocean springs. There\r\nis, or was, a similar uprising in the Gulf of Spezzia, and fresh water\r\ncrustacea inhabit these localities. These occurrences prevent the sea\r\nfrom becoming too salt by evaporation. When salt water becomes tainted\r\nit is very offensive—much more so than fresh water. If, therefore, the\r\nocean were not continually in movement, it would be very injurious.\r\n\r\nSo much for the water of the sea; let us now see what it does. We will\r\nglance at the surface ere we plunge into the depths.\r\n\r\nIn childhood, and even in after years, we most of us delight in\r\nwatching the waves of the sea. What finer sight than that we can\r\nobtain on the bold Cornish coast with a westerly wind, when the great\r\nAtlantic waves come rolling in and dashing up to the tops of the\r\nTintagel cliffs, wearing and grinding them away; hissing up the sands\r\nat New Quay, or thundering on the shores of “Bude and Boss”! Then the\r\nwind abates, the sea goes down, the billows become waves, the waves\r\nto wavelets grow, less and less, until there is a mere ripple on the\r\nsurface which is never still. The mighty heaving of the ocean breast is\r\nthe peculiarity of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 698.—Sea waves.]\r\n\r\nYet, again, as we stand to watch the waves, or run from them as they\r\nsweep in foam upon the sloping sand, we shall find that they increase\r\nor decrease in force, and the level of the water rises or sinks by\r\ndegrees. The _tide_ is flowing or ebbing as the case may be. So we know\r\nthe surface has another—a current motion—besides the undulation of the\r\nwater. The currents of the ocean are very valuable attributes, the Gulf\r\nStream in particular bringing us warmth and, indeed, rain. There are\r\nthree movements of the ocean—waves, currents, and tides.\r\n\r\nThe waves, perhaps, interest us most, as they come rolling in with\r\nirregular force, but all mightily impelled by the wind. We have all\r\nnoticed the ripples on a puddle; the same action of the wind produces\r\nthe grandeur of the waves of the ocean. The wave comes rolling in\r\nbefore the wind to break against the rocks or beach, and another\r\nforms to break in its place; the higher the waves the more quickly\r\nthey appear to move. But when the wind has subsided the rolling, or\r\n“swell,” remains,—a long, lazy, undulating motion—a rocking to sleep\r\nof the billows of the sea. Without a ripple on the surface these huge\r\nrollers will glide towards the shore and break upon the shingle with a\r\nroaring sound which can be heard for miles, dragging the pebbles after\r\nthem as they recede with a rattling like bones and marbles. The pebble\r\nridge at Westward Ho! will illustrate this vividly at times, the sound\r\nbeing heard far inland like continuous thunder, and on a calm night,\r\nwhen there is no wind stirring, the roar of the ground swell is weird\r\nand mysterious in the gloom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 699.—The Piroroco on the Amazon.]\r\n\r\nThe height of waves is very varied. Observers say that forty-four\r\nfeet is about the highest-known wave from hollow to crest. Waves of\r\nthirty-five feet have been often met with, and off the Irish coast and\r\nin the Atlantic sailors tell of waves “as big as houses.” But houses\r\ndiffer in size as do waves.\r\n\r\nThe rate which waves are estimated to travel varies with the\r\nwind-propelling force. The average hurricane wave travels at about\r\nforty-five miles an hour. But earthquake waves—those set in motion by\r\nsubaqueous disturbance—have been known to travel at the rate of six\r\nhundred feet in a second for thousands of miles across the ocean. Such\r\na one occurred after the earthquake which destroyed the town of Arica\r\nin August 1868, and the wave crossed the Pacific to Chetham Islands,\r\n5,520 miles, in fifteen hours and twenty minutes. We have many of us\r\nseen the great tidal waves, or “bores,” which at certain seasons rush\r\nup our rivers—the Severn, for instance—with great violence, and at\r\ntimes forty feet high.\r\n\r\nThese tidal waves are also experienced in the Ganges, the Amazon, and\r\nat Bordeaux, as well as in China and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that the tides also affect the land, and the\r\ntheory of these ocean movements is a very interesting study. We have\r\nalready referred to it under ASTRONOMY, for the Sun’s and Moon’s\r\nattraction is the main cause of the phenomenon, which is so familiar\r\nand yet so strange. But the consideration of the tides must be again\r\nentered upon here ere we proceed to view the effects of the sea upon\r\nthe land, and how the physical geographical features alter.\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton rightly attributed the cause of the tides to the\r\nattraction of the moon and sun. Spring tides occur when both luminaries\r\nare above the meridian, and the neap, or low tides, happen when the sun\r\nand moon are farthest apart. The highest tides are perceived after a\r\nnew or full moon; the lowest, after she has passed the first or third\r\nquarter. In January the spring tide is highest of all, because the\r\nearth is nearest to the sun then, and his force of attraction, added\r\nto that of the moon, causes a very high tide. With the assistance of\r\nthe accompanying diagrams we shall be able to make the tidal phenomena\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 700.—Tidal Attraction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 701.—Tidal Attraction.]\r\n\r\nSuppose the moon to be at M, the point J (the sea) will be nearest\r\nto the moon and will be attracted, while the earth will exercise a\r\nretarding power to a certain extent. This attraction of the water from\r\nits usual level causes a kind of vacuum, into which the surrounding\r\nwater flows and causes a high tide at H. At the opposite side the\r\nearth, not the water, is most attracted, and then the water rushes in\r\nto a certain extent to fill the vacancy left by the earth’s movement\r\ntowards the moon. Another high tide is therefore caused at L, but not\r\nso high as the tide upon the opposite side, as the Moon is so much\r\nnearer the latter. The tide, then, is only the natural movement of the\r\nsea water to fill up the space the earth and other portions of the\r\nwatery mass have vacated in obedience to lunar and solar attraction,\r\nwhich is, to a certain extent, counterbalanced by the attraction and\r\nresistance of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe _neap_ tides are caused by the opposing forces of attraction of the\r\nsun and moon. The sun, as it were, pulls one way, the moon the other.\r\nThe latter (being nearer) having twice the power of the former, causes\r\na tide indeed, but it is a low one. The _spring_ tide occurs when sun\r\nand moon together attract the water.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the rise of the tide are sometimes very disastrous,\r\nand when the wind assists the sea, and heaps up the water, the sight\r\nis grand in the extreme. On the coast of Schleswig, at Hallingen, the\r\nsea has washed away a whole cluster of islands, and now the waves cause\r\ntremendous inundations. About every six years, on the average, a great\r\nflood happens for such trifles as a high tide are of no account. In\r\n1362 and in 1834 terrible destruction was wrought; the coffins and\r\nbodies were washed out of the graves. Piles of _débris_ are then washed\r\nup, and sand and gravel accumulates for a time till again carried away.\r\n\r\nTravellers to France will notice the “dunes,” or sandhills of Calais,\r\nas the train winds its way to Boulogne. We find that whenever the\r\nshore is flat the shingle and sand are blown inwards and form “dunes,”\r\nand the sand is distributed far inland, checking all vegetation, and\r\naltering the features of the country. The wearing away of rocks by the\r\nwater, the continual undermining of them by the waves, and sometimes\r\nthe disengagement of great blocks weighing many tons—all these effects\r\nof the sea tend to alter the appearance of the land. We may observe the\r\ndenudation in many places along the coast—the caves, holes, and tunnels\r\neaten out by the water. In Norway the “Fiords” are very remarkable.\r\nThey were formed by the upheaval of the land, and tell us of the\r\nglaciers which once filled them up. Thus by ice and water the solid\r\nland is ground down and eaten away hourly, daily, and for countless\r\ncenturies, changing the place of the hard rock into a standing water,\r\nand the flintstone into a springing well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 702.—The Dunes.]\r\n\r\nWe must now plunge beneath the waves, never fearing the rough surface;\r\nwe shall find all smooth and quiet at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nWhat can we tell about the bottom of the sea to which no man has ever\r\nreached living, and from which we have no information? We can lay\r\nour telegraph or telephone lines beneath the waves, and far from the\r\nrestless waves in those quiet depths where no billows can reach. What\r\ntreasures must lie hidden at the bottom of the sea! The treasures, the\r\ngold and silver, the merchandize, the wealth of centuries. The sailor\r\nlies sleeping there\r\n\r\n      ...  “Serene and safe\r\n    From tempest and from billow;\r\n    The storms that high above him chafe\r\n    Ne’er rock his peaceful pillow”!\r\n\r\nWhat can we hope to find at the bottom of the sea we cannot reach? Yes,\r\nbut we can reach it. By sounding with Brooke’s lead (a cannon ball, as\r\nshown in the illustration), we can arrive at a certain knowledge of\r\nthe composition of the ocean bed. The right-hand figure of the two is\r\nthe lead when being lowered, and while it is sinking the cord remains\r\ntight. So soon as it touches the bottom the weight of the cannon ball\r\ndivides the line, and the tube is easily drawn up again. It has been\r\nwell greased, and so in the cavity of the rod some shells and sand are\r\nfound adhering. These fragments tell us the composition of the bottom\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nHere we find tiny shells, just as we find them in chalk, the same\r\nformation as that which piled up the cliffs which have risen from, or\r\nbeen discovered, by the sea. By other ingenious contrivances water can\r\nbe fetched up from the bottom of the ocean, and the temperature can be\r\ngauged all along the sounding line. The expedition of the _Challenger_\r\nbrought many interesting facts to light. Far down in these solitudes\r\nare marine animals,—crustacea, star-fish, seaweeds, and shells,—all\r\nof which are carried up by the dredge worked by a steam engine; for\r\nthe resistance is very great, and the weight supported at the depth\r\nof two miles must be considerable, and is equal to four atmospheres.\r\nA thermometer has come up crushed even in its iron case, and so the\r\ncreatures which inhabit and find means to live at the bottom of the sea\r\nmust be specially fitted by Nature for the locality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 703.—Brooke’s Lead.]\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the ocean bed has given rise to many different\r\nopinions. It has been maintained that there are mountains and valleys,\r\nhills and dales underneath the water, all clothed with marine\r\nvegetation, equal in height and depth to the terrestrial hills and\r\nvales. Again it has been declared that the ocean bed is level; but we\r\nfind raised portions, which we call islands, which may be the tops of\r\nmountains, or portions of the mainland separated from their parent\r\ncontinent by an inroad of the sea, as are our islands of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe sea-bed, however, is very irregular. We find deep and steep\r\nvalleys, and high hills, but the picturesque peaks caused by the action\r\nof air, frost, and water on earth are not, of course, represented\r\nunder water. Between the Irish coast and Newfoundland we are told the\r\nbed is level for nearly four hundred miles. There is a deep declivity\r\nbefore we reach this plain. The centre of the Atlantic is a plain,\r\nand on it the most volcanic islands rise, such as Ascension and the\r\nAzores. Between England and Greenland there was at one time a land\r\ncommunication, as we have remarked under GEOLOGY, and there are\r\nsubmarine terraces now. [An immense river once ran through Western\r\nEurope somewhere about where our islands are.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 704—The Drag Net.]\r\n\r\nUnder the Atlantic we have remains of _foraminifera_ and other tiny\r\nanimals, with red clay and volcanic remains which must have been of\r\nsubmarine origin. The Pacific shows us tops of mountains as islands\r\n(Hawaii Isles), and an enormous range must be hidden beneath the\r\nwaters. What a change in the physical geography of the earth a slight\r\nsinking of the water of the ocean would make; England and the Continent\r\nwould be united, and many sea-mountains (islands) discovered. The\r\ngreatest ocean depth is four miles and a half, but in many places a few\r\nhundred feet less depth than at present would reveal many changes in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nEvery year since the world has gained its present form the streams and\r\nrivers have been pouring water, and carrying mud, stones, and gravel\r\nceaselessly into the ocean. In addition to this, the surface water\r\nwashes the stones away, animals (corals) build up islands from the\r\ndepths, and take up space in the ocean. We know that if we put our\r\nhand in a basin full of water we displace a quantity of the fluid; so\r\nwe might imagine that, the sea being already full, every island formed\r\nwould tend to an overflow of the sea, and the land would be thereby\r\nburied. That the sea does encroach upon the earth we know, but it also\r\nrecedes. Here is the balance of Nature.\r\n\r\nRivers pour in water and material. The sun absorbs the water and\r\nprevents overflow; tiny animals make shells from the material. All the\r\ncauses we have mentioned tend to permit the encroachment of the waters,\r\nbut volcanic action and even earthquakes act also to neutralize this\r\ntendency by upheaving hills and mountains, which prevent the invasion\r\nof the sea by its elevation or by land depression. We have seen in\r\nour chapters upon GEOLOGY how the ocean beds have been upheaved, and\r\nremains of marine animals are daily found upon our highest hills. Thus\r\nthe forces which sometimes cause such destruction in the earth are the\r\nmeans whereby the waters are kept in their places. But for volcanic\r\naction the land might all disappear by denudation and continual wear\r\nand tear, and be deposited at the bottom of the sea!\r\n\r\nIf it were not for currents, of which many defined ones exist in\r\nthe ocean, and the never-ceasing flow and ebb of the tides, the sea\r\nwould soon lose its purity and clearness. Though the water is salt\r\nand becoming salter, animalculæ and all kinds of plant-animals would\r\nstill increase and multiply; so the decay of animal and vegetable\r\nmatter would quickly render the ocean a source of pestilence and death\r\nto mankind, and be most injurious to animal life generally. But the\r\nmovement is so ceaseless, and the various fish and mammalia (whales,\r\nfor instance), by preying upon each other, as other animals on earth\r\ndo, keep up the balance of production, and the organic matter deposited\r\nin the sea is also cleared away.\r\n\r\nThat the constant currents of the sea prevent the formation and\r\ngrowth of seaweed is clearly shown by the great “Sargasso Sea,” or\r\ntract of weed (_Fucus natans_), called the Gulf-weed. This great\r\ntract embraces thousands of square miles, and is situated in the very\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic Ocean, where there are but few currents; but\r\nsurrounding it is the Gulf-Stream, an enormous current of water running\r\nat a regular rate of four or five miles an hour. This Gulf-Stream is\r\nsupposed to be caused by the same laws and influences which determine\r\nthe trade-winds—namely, a constant rarefaction of the water at the\r\ntropical parts of the earth, and a corresponding condensation at the\r\nArctic portions, for warm water is much lighter than cold, and when\r\nthe waters of the tropical regions become lighter, the heavier waters\r\nof the cold regions pressing down more forcibly tend to raise them\r\nabove their proper level; they therefore flow towards those very parts\r\nwhich have sunk down by their contraction, and a constant current\r\ntakes place; this current is the Gulf-Stream. It runs from the Gulf of\r\nMexico northwards towards Newfoundland, turning by Iceland towards the\r\nBritish Isles, by France and Spain, onwards to the coasts of Africa\r\nand South America, the West Indies, and again to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nalthough the return current does not go by the name of Gulf-Stream.\r\nThis great stream of water, warmed by the tropical sun, serves the same\r\ntwo purposes fulfilled by the trade-winds—namely, a circulation and\r\ndistribution of the superfluous heat of the equatorial regions, warming\r\nthe northern countries; and cooling, by the return of under-currents,\r\nthose in the tropics. The fogs of Newfoundland are caused by the great\r\ncurrent of warm water entering the cold region and carrying with them\r\nsurface-currents of moist air, which the cold condenses into fog, just\r\nas the breath is visible in a cold atmosphere. England owes its moist\r\nand mild climate to the same cause. The depth of the Gulf-Stream itself\r\nis very little. It is a mere layer of warm water. (_See_ Sir George\r\nNares’ reports of the _Challenger_ expedition.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 705.—Atoll, or Coral Island.]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages you have now seen, and, we hope, gained, some\r\ninformation concerning the sea sufficient, at any rate, to induce you\r\nto enter more deeply into the subject than we can at present do. We\r\nhave learnt how the sea water is composed, and what goes on on the\r\nsurface. We have discussed waves, and referred to tides and currents,\r\nthe wearing away and the renewal of land by the sea; we have dived\r\nbeneath the surface, and found something to interest us at the bottom\r\nof the ocean. As we come up again we are surprised to find islands or\r\nreefs where none existed when we went down. What has caused this sudden\r\nappearance? They may have been slowly raised to the surface by coral\r\ninsects, or suddenly by volcanic action. Let us consider the coral,\r\nwhich plays a very important part in our Physical Geography, before we\r\nproceed to the volcanic island.[32]\r\n\r\nThe low-lying islands are those formed by the skeletons of the coral\r\ninsects, and the Coralline Islands are some of the most wonderful\r\nproductions of nature. They are only found in warm climates, between\r\nthe twenty-eighth degrees of north and south latitude, and limestone\r\npure and simple is the chief component of the coral reef, as it is of\r\nthe mountains erupted from the depths of the sea. “The detritus of\r\ncorals, echinodermata shells, reticularia, and other living creatures,”\r\nsays a writer on this subject, “deposit not only the salts of lime\r\nextracted from the ocean, but their own dead bodies to form the hard\r\nsubstance of the rock.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 706.—Gorgonia guttata (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 707.—Coral (_Madrepora brachiata_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 708.—Spicules of Gorgonia (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe coral insect is a zoophyte (Anthozoa), which, as may be seen from\r\nthe illustrations, assumes curious and elegant forms, and the coral it\r\nproduces is a limy or calcareous deposit, which is fixed upon a rocky\r\nbase. As years go on these accretions become greater and greater, and\r\nat length rise above the water. When a little distance below it, the\r\nreefs form dangerous and frequently unsuspected barriers, upon which\r\nships are wrecked. The red coral is dredged up from the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere there are extensive coral fisheries. This coral is found deep in\r\nthe water, and never rises to the surface. Formerly there were coral\r\nreefs in the European seas, but the changes of temperature stopped\r\ntheir production. The “atolls,” or circular coral reefs with an opening\r\nat one side, have been described by Professor Darwin. “Who,” says the\r\ngreat naturalist, “would not be struck with wonder and admiration on\r\ncatching sight for the first time of this vast ring of coral rock,\r\noften many miles in diameter? Sometimes a low green island is seen\r\nbeyond it, with a shore of dazzling whiteness; outside is the foaming\r\nsurf of the ocean, and within it a broad expanse of tranquil water,\r\nof pale green colour and exquisite purity.” These “atolls” mark the\r\nsituation of sunken islands, and the extension of them and the barrier\r\nreefs would seem to indicate a slow but decided sinking of the bottom\r\nof the Indian and other oceans; but the “reefs” tell us that the land\r\nto which they are attached has not become depressed, and may have\r\nbecome elevated. We may then conclude that a continual rising and\r\ndepression of the land is taking place in various oceans, indicating\r\na sinking of the ocean bed in one locality and the result of volcanic\r\nactivity in another, for no active volcanoes are found in the regions\r\nof depression.\r\n\r\nWe must now leave the sea and come to land again, to consider volcanoes\r\nand volcanic action there.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nThe various phenomena of volcanoes form a subject very difficult to be\r\nexplained, as it is impossible to ascertain positively the cause of\r\nvolcanic action. Whether the earth is interiorly a mass of molten rock\r\nand fire, or whether the heat is created by the intense contractile\r\nforce and movement of rocks, and their motion thus developed into heat\r\naided by chemical combination, we cannot absolutely determine. The\r\ntheory restricting volcanic phenomena to the upper crust of the earth,\r\nby supposing the local accumulations of hot liquid masses of rock,\r\nwhich are forcibly emptied by the expansion of vapours, may perhaps be\r\nfound the true one.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the volcanoes are found near, or at no very great\r\ndistance from, the sea. We may therefore expect to find that water\r\nhas something to do with the eruptions as it has in the case of the\r\nGeysers. But this hypothesis will scarcely hold good in every case,\r\nthough volcanoes of later ages are limited to regions very different\r\nfrom those in which volcanic action used to be. For instance, in\r\nAmerica we have only volcanoes on the Pacific side, and the Andes\r\nfurnish several. Mexico, Central America, and California possess many\r\nvolcanoes, and as far north as Alaska we find Mount Elias. There are\r\nplenty of extinct volcanoes in Europe, but the Mediterranean produces\r\nthe active vents; and about the Red Sea and the Caspian, and even in\r\nthe central chain of Asia, there are volcanoes far from water. The\r\nHawaii isles, on the other hand, are all volcanic, and Australasia\r\nfurnishes us with remarkable specimens; so altogether the testimony\r\ntends to prove that where volcanic remains are apparent the sea had at\r\none time been, or now is, near at hand.\r\n\r\nBurning mountains have been familiar to us from our childhood in\r\npictures, and by stirring narrative of destruction wrought by them.\r\nThe volcano is generally a mountain rising to a cone, but Vesuvius\r\npresented quite the appearance of a hollow basin at the top, before it\r\nsuddenly broke forth and buried Herculaneum in ashes. Von Buck visited\r\nit in 1799, and declares it had at one time risen, like an island,\r\nfrom the sea. There are about two hundred and seventy volcanoes at\r\npresent in activity; four in Europe; eleven in Iceland and Jan Meyen’s\r\nland; in Asia, ninety-three; in Africa, twenty-six; forty-six in North\r\nAmerica and the Aleutian Isles; twenty-seven in Central America and the\r\nAntilles; in South America, thirty-one; and twenty-four islands with\r\nvolcanic tendencies largely developed. There may be many more “resting.”\r\n\r\nVolcanoes, then, are openings or vents which communicate with the\r\nmelted rock within the earth, and the conical form of volcanoes is\r\nowing to the deposits of volcanic matter as it falls from the opening\r\ncalled the _crater_. If we let a small spade full of mould run through\r\nour hands, or from the spade, it will form a small cone, the heavier\r\nparticles sliding to the base at a certain slope. Thus the volcano\r\nbuilds its own hill, and inside the crater we find cones from which\r\nsmoke and steam issue. These cones within the cone are the points of\r\nissue of vapour and smoke, miniature volcanoes making up a whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 709.—Eruption of Vesuvius, August 26th, 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe signs of eruptions are much the same, and usually occur a couple\r\nof days before the actual outbreak takes place. First smoke is\r\nperceived, perhaps, and the escape of various noxious gases accompanied\r\nby earthquakes occur. Now the eruption may commence and blow away the\r\nsummit of the mountain, as in the case of the commencement of the\r\ncatastrophe of A.D. 79, when the whole side of Vesuvius was torn away,\r\nand continuous showers of ashes fell for days and nights, burying\r\neverything, while the hot lava poured down the sides. Stones and ashes\r\nwith vapours are hurled into the air. Clouds of steam are formed,\r\nand vivid electrical discharges take place in these clouds, while\r\nwater dashes down, carrying stones (“volcanic bombs”), and reflected\r\nlurid flames from within are cast on the steaming clouds, which look\r\nlike fiery columns. Then the lava issues in a white, hot, steady,\r\nirresistible stream, covering everything, and burning up all vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 710.—Birth of a volcano.]\r\n\r\nNew volcanoes are continually in process of formation, and at Santorin\r\nfor hundreds of years volcanic action has been busy in forming islands.\r\nThese violent efforts of Nature frequently give rise to earthquakes,\r\nwhich are the most destructive of natural convulsions. The records of\r\nlate occurrences are fresh in the minds of all readers, and need not\r\nbe specified. The slow subsidence and gradual upheaval of the land is\r\nstill going on, but we are frequently startled by the account of a\r\nrupture of the ground or the destruction of a portion of a city.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earthquake is generally in a direct line, and\r\nundulating. Sometimes what are termed vertical shocks arise and destroy\r\nsolidly-built edifices. Mountains have been overturned by earthquake\r\nshocks, and trees have been twisted round. Sometimes the ground\r\nyawns into enormous fissures. The sea is tossed into great waves and\r\nencroaches upon the land, and when the sea recedes the recession of the\r\nwater is followed by a more terrible invading wave sweeping all before\r\nit. Earth tremblings often occur far away from volcanoes, and without\r\nany visible connection with volcanic action. There are many aspects of\r\nland and water which the student of geography will remember, but which\r\nneed not be separately treated of. We must, however, refer to plains,\r\nplateaus, and lakes. The mountains also play a most important part in\r\nPhysical Geography and in “Climatology,” as they collect the vapours\r\nfor rain, and make the valleys fertile, and thick with vegetation. We\r\nhave spoken of the mountains under GEOLOGY, and the various formations\r\nand strata will be found enumerated there, but now we have to do with\r\nthe mountain chains in their physical aspect as regards their shape and\r\nappearance on the globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 711.—Earthquake fissures.]\r\n\r\nAny elevation rising from a base more than 1,000 feet may fairly be\r\ntermed a mountain, and solitary mountains are usually volcanic, because\r\neruptive rock does not produce chains of mountains. The origin of\r\nmountains is probably due to the contraction and compression of the\r\ncrust of the earth—not merely the surface, but the whole thickness\r\nbetween us and the supposed molten interior. Mountains did not exist\r\nfrom everlasting, for the very good reason that they are (in most\r\ncases) composed of stratified rocks. Stratified rocks are sedimentary\r\nrocks, and must have been deposited below water, and hardened long\r\nbefore they were thrust up by pressure. Moreover, we find (as has\r\nalready been explained) shells and remains of marine animals on the\r\nhigher summits, which prove to demonstration that these mountains are\r\ncomposed of rocks which were laid down under the sea.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana was one of the first geologists to advance the theory\r\nthat contraction and lateral displacement are the causes of the\r\nelevation of mountains. A very good illustration of this theory was\r\nmade by Chamontier, who covered an india-rubber balloon with a thick\r\nlayer of wax, and when it had hardened sufficiently he pricked a hole\r\nin the bladder, which immediately contracted, and the wax at once rose\r\nup into tiny similitudes of mountains, showing in a sufficiently clear\r\nmanner that such protuberances may be produced by the pressure of the\r\nearth’s contraction, and in such a mass as our earth the elevations\r\nwould naturally be very great.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie has shown how, by a very simple experiment, the\r\ncontortion of mountain strata is effected by pressure. A number of\r\ncloths or towels placed flat on a table represent the sedimentary\r\nrocks. Place a board with a weight on the top, and the towels will\r\nremain flattened. But by holding two boards at the sides and pressing\r\nthem together (the weighted board still remaining), we shall find\r\nthe towels crumpled and upheaved like the Jurassic strata shown in\r\nthe illustration (fig. 712). Professor Heim calls the central masses\r\nwrinkles of the earth’s crust. So the Alps were pressed up or heaved\r\ninto the air, the weather—rain, frost, snow, and sunshine—imparting\r\nthe infinite variety of “Horn,” “Needle,” and “Peak,” so expressively\r\napplied in Alpine nomenclature;—the Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Weisshorn;\r\nthe Pic du Midi, Aiguille de Dru, Aiguille Verte, and many other\r\nmountains in well-trodden Switzerland will occur to the reader at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 712.—Anticlinal and synclinal curves of the Jura\r\nMountains.]\r\n\r\nThe slopes of mountains—though to the casual observer they may appear\r\nvery much the same—are very different. We sometimes find a long,\r\neasy ascent, —more usually a steepish inclination, perhaps 20°;—in\r\nother places, such as on the Matterhorn, an almost perpendicular\r\nface. Forty-five degrees rise is very steep, and 53° is the limit\r\nof any great mountain’s slope. Cliffs and precipices there are, of\r\ncourse; witness the terrible fall from the Matterhorn to the glacier\r\nbelow—thousands of feet with one tremendous leap from the rock to the\r\nice underneath; but mountain _slopes_ are not precipices. As a rule,\r\nwe find that one side of a mountain chain is steeper than the opposite\r\none. It is harder to climb up from Italy to Switzerland than to ascend\r\nin the opposite direction. The Pyrenees are also steeper on the south\r\nside. The Scandinavian mountains likewise are steeper in the west.\r\nThe Himalaya are steepest towards the sea, so are the Ghauts. We here\r\nfind a difference between the slopes of the NEW and OLD WORLDS. In the\r\nformer we have the less precipitous mountain slopes towards the east;\r\nin the old world they are towards the north, and an inspection of a\r\nphysical map of the world leads us to the conclusion that the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific Oceans are the boundaries of entirely different degrees of\r\nslopes. The Pacific and Indian Oceans would appear to border the more\r\nprecipitous mountain sides; the Atlantic and its connections those less\r\nsteep.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, we have the most elevated portions of the earth, mountains,\r\nand high tablelands, in equatorial regions; and within the torrid\r\nzone every terrestrial climate is to be found, owing to the snows of\r\nthe high mountains and the heat of the valleys, which are naturally\r\nclosely connected with the upheaval of mountain ranges. We have already\r\nspoken of the never-ceasing influences of the air and water upon the\r\nrocks, and we need say little about valleys. There are valleys of\r\ndislocation, denudation, and undulation. The great valley of Western\r\nAsia, wherein lie the Caspian and Aral seas, seems to have been caused\r\nby the upheaval of the Caucasus and the Persian plateau.\r\n\r\nPLAINS are very varied. We have European _Heaths_ and _Landes_;\r\nAmerican _Savannahs_, _Prairies_, and _Pampas_; Asian _Steppes_, and\r\nAfrican _Deserts_. All of these possess certain features in common,\r\nmore or less vegetation, and sometimes absolute sterility.\r\n\r\nPLATEAUS, or _Tablelands_, are elevated plains frequently undulating\r\nin character. The Plateau of Bolivia is 13,000 feet high, and extends\r\nalong by the Andes. The tableland of Quito is nearly 10,000 feet high,\r\nand borders on the giants Cotopaxi and Chimbarazo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 713.—The Staubbach (Lauterbrunnen).]\r\n\r\nRivers and lakes add not only to the wealth of nations by their\r\nusefulness, but, by the additional picturesqueness of their appearance,\r\nto the beauty of the landscape. The velocity of rivers would be very\r\nmuch increased if it were not for the strong resistance offered by the\r\nbanks and the stones to the current, and by friction. The Rhine and the\r\nRhone, if thus unimpeded, would flow at a rate considerably over one\r\nhundred miles an hour; and our own little stream (the Thames), instead\r\nof eddying peacefully and twirling gracefully by Medmenham or Cookham,\r\nwould rush along at the speed of the train which so often crosses it on\r\nits way to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of river-beds, like the slopes of mountains, vary very\r\nconsiderably, and the inclination of a river varies at different\r\nplaces; in a distance of seven hundred miles the Amazon only falls\r\ntwelve feet, and the current flows chiefly by impetus already acquired.\r\nA slope of one foot in two hundred precludes all navigation, and at\r\nstill greater inclines rapids and cataracts are formed—the great\r\nfalls wearing away the river-bed by degrees; so it is calculated that\r\nhundreds of years ago Niagara Fall was much farther down the river, and\r\nthe cataract is slowly moving up stream. In time, as the rock wears\r\naway, the height will disappear as the celebrated “Falls,” and will\r\nbecome a rapid within a few miles of the lake.\r\n\r\nLakes are derived from river-drainage and springs. Some are very salt,\r\nowing to evaporation carrying away so much water, and leaving the\r\naccumulated mineral salts. These very salt lakes are likely to dry up,\r\nas the supply of water is not equal to the demands of evaporation.\r\nFloating islands appear and disappear on many lakes. Derwentwater is\r\none instance. On the uses of lakes and rivers it would be superfluous\r\nto dwell. We are more concerned to examine their influence on climate,\r\nand in this sense we must also consider mountains. But we will now\r\ngroup all the phenomena of the air and water, and their effect upon\r\nclimate, under “Meteorology” in the chapters next following.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Those who wish to study the subject fully should read “Corals and\r\nCoral Reefs,” by the late Charles Darwin, and Dana’s “Coral Islands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.

The air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen with some\r\ncarbonic acid gas and aqueous vapour. We have, under the Chemistry\r\nsection, discussed these constituents which unite to make up the air or\r\natmosphere in the following proportions:—\r\n\r\n  Oxygen            210·0\r\n  Nitrogen          775·0\r\n  Aqueous Vapour     14·2\r\n  Carbonic Acid       0·8\r\n                  -------\r\n                   1000·0\r\n                  =======\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that all over the world the same chemical result is found.\r\nWhether we bottle up the air in the valley, or, as Gay-Lussac did, go\r\nup to an elevation of 21,000 feet in a balloon, we shall find the air\r\nof the same chemical composition. In Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\r\nit is all the same. The pressure is less as we ascend, and we cannot\r\nmanage to breathe in very high altitudes so well as upon the ground\r\n_for which we were fitted_, but the air is the same.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, then, is not always equal in density, nor is it quite\r\ntransparent. The light from sun and stars is, to a certain extent,\r\nlost, and it has been calculated that the sun’s rays lose one-fifth\r\npart of their brightness passing through the atmosphere. We all\r\nknow what the air is. We breathe it, we feel it blowing, we witness\r\nits effects. Were it not composed as it is we should die or go mad;\r\nplants would not live, and the earth would become a desert. Air is\r\neverywhere—invisible; a so-called empty vessel is full of air because\r\nan animal will live in it till the atmosphere has become vitiated\r\nby the carbonic acid from the lungs. Yet air, or rather its watery\r\nportion, is visible when condensed.\r\n\r\nVapour is not perceptible. But how does it become so? We cannot see\r\nthe air, how can we see a portion of it? We can answer this question\r\nby illustration. The steam from an engine is not visible on a very hot\r\nday. But when the day is damp and dull the vapour is _condensed_, and\r\nbecomes visible; then air appears and is resolved into vapour again.\r\nThis change was effected by heating water and then cooling it, when it\r\ncame back to water again. This watery vapour is always present in the\r\natmosphere. Heat, also, is present in the atmosphere, and the sun is\r\nthe origin of that heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 714.—High tide and storm on the coast of Schleswig.]\r\n\r\nHeat, we know, is the effects of the rapid motion of small particles\r\nof matter, and is radiated from our bodies—so we feel cold; it reaches\r\nour bodies, and we feel warm. So air is heated or cooled by the sun,\r\nnot in its absence, except when the earth and air have been so warmed\r\nduring the day that the heat is given out by them long after sunset.\r\nWe have read of the pressure of the atmosphere in the PHYSICS section,\r\nand that warm air is lighter than cold air, as shown in the ascension\r\nof the Montgolfier balloon. It is this variation of temperature of the\r\natmosphere that gives birth to one great meteorological agent—viz., the\r\nWIND, which we will now consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDS AND AIR CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nWe can easily illustrate the cause of winds. Suppose we have a hot\r\nroom and a cold one, and we suddenly open the door of communication\r\nbetween them, the heated air which has risen to the ceiling of one room\r\nwill rush out through the upper part of the opening of the door, and\r\nthe cooler current will flow in just above the floor. If we place a\r\nlighted candle in the upper and lower part of the opening we shall see\r\nthe flame tending outwards from the heated room, and in an opposite\r\ndirection from the cold room. In the centre of the open door there will\r\nbe but slight disturbance. So it is in nature. The warm air ascends,\r\ncooler air rushes in to fill the space, and a storm or a breeze is\r\ncreated. The balance must be restored. The upper current probably\r\nmoves one way, and the lower the other way. Thus clouds are said to be\r\n“coming up against the wind” when they are moving in an upper current,\r\nor in a different direction to that the wind is blowing just above the\r\nearth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe wind moves, with varying velocity. We have a gentle breeze when the\r\nmotion of the air is about five or six miles an hour, a good breeze at\r\ntwenty-five miles an hour, a high wind at thirty-five, and a gale at\r\nfifty. Hurricanes travel at sixty and seventy miles an hour, and do\r\nenormous damage. Near the Equator we do not find much wind, and this\r\nfact has caused the name of the Region of Calms, or “The Doldrums” of\r\nsailors, to be bestowed upon that portion of the globe, but this belt\r\nof calm has no fixed position. It follows the sun’s course, and is the\r\nregion of greatest heat, and, as it were, the centre of a concentric\r\ncircle of currents. The hot air rises and goes away; air rushes\r\nin north and south, and causes what are called the North-East and\r\nSouth-East Trades, or Trade Winds, owing to their being so useful in\r\ncommerce for ships, or to the old meaning of the word trade, a “regular\r\ncourse.” The calms of the Tropic of Cancer are called the “Horse\r\nLatitudes.”\r\n\r\nReaders of the life of Columbus will remember how his crew were\r\naffrighted at the persistency of the wind which bore him across, for\r\nno sail requires shifting, nor is a sheet altered while the vessel\r\nis making way with the “Trades.” Were the earth covered with water,\r\nwe should find the trade-winds blowing equally over the surface, but\r\nthe varying temperature of the land diverts them. The rarefaction of\r\nthe air in the Sahara causes a westerly wind to prevail, which blows\r\ntowards the land, instead of the trade wind we might expect to find.\r\n\r\nThe MONSOONS, again, are caused in like manner, for the ordinary\r\n“trade” from the south-east is changed by the elevation of the heated\r\nair in Central Asia into a south-west wind, and so in the south, in\r\nconsequence of the heated air from Australia, the north-west trade\r\nappears as a north-east monsoon, but is altered to a north-west wind.\r\nNearly all the year round, therefore, we find the two winds, which are\r\nmodifications of the “trades,” blowing in different directions and from\r\ndifferent quarters. From November to March there is a north-east wind\r\nnorth of the Equator, and a north-west wind blows south of the Equator.\r\nFrom April to September a south-west wind blows at the north, and a\r\nsouth-east wind at the south of the line. The term monsoon signifies a\r\n“season,” and the changes of these winds give rise to tremendous storms\r\ncausing great havoc.\r\n\r\nSEA and LAND breezes are really little monsoons; they are caused\r\nby the heat of the sun in just the same way, but with miniature\r\nresults. We all know the sea-breeze which comes in as the land gets\r\nhot during the day, for the land warms more quickly than the sea\r\nunder equally existing circumstances. So again, in the evening, the\r\nland loses its heat more quickly, and then the cool air flows out\r\nagain to take the place of the warmer sea air which is continuing to\r\nascend. The intensity and regularity varies when the degrees of heat\r\nare most different between land and sea and in tropical regions; and\r\nthe varied coast formation will of course affect the wind, but as a\r\nrule the fact may be accepted as plainly explained, sea-breeze in the\r\nmorning, land-breeze at night, and amateur sailors in boats at our\r\nwatering-places will do well to bear this in mind.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of local winds deriving their names from their\r\ndirection or influence. We may mention them briefly. The special terms\r\nfor winds are—\r\n\r\n  The North Wind, or Tramontana.\r\n  The North-East Wind, or Greco.\r\n  The East Wind, or Levanter.\r\n  The South-East Wind, or Sirocco.\r\n  The South Wind, or Ostro.\r\n  The South-West Wind, or Libeccio.\r\n  The West Wind, or Ponente.\r\n  The North-West Wind, or Maestro-Mistral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 715.—On a lee shore.]\r\n\r\nThe Mistral, or Maestrale, is well known at Nice as the north wind,\r\nwhile at Toulon it is a north-east wind. The other winds, such as the\r\nSirocco, which in some places is a warm, damp wind, in Madeira is a hot\r\nwind, and likewise in Sicily, where it is equally warm and damp like\r\nsteam. It has different names in various countries, such as Samiel in\r\nTurkey, and sometimes as Föhn in Switzerland, where it may, however, be\r\na north wind—which, as all travellers know, is a dry and a hazy-weather\r\nbreeze, yet sometimes moist. The _Simoon_ is a very hot wind raising\r\nsand-storms in the deserts, and experience has shown it to be very\r\nprejudicial to life in consequence of the fine sand and the tremendous\r\nheat it carries with it. Egypt is subject to another hot wind,\r\ncalled the _Khamsin_, and the west coast of Africa is subject to the\r\n_Harmattan_, a dry, easterly wind. The cold, dry wind of the Himalaya\r\nis known as the Tereno. In South America there is the same wind, the\r\n_Pampero_ blowing east and south-east. The Euroclydon, mentioned by\r\nSt. Paul, is the modern _bora_ over the Adriatic. Malta rejoices (or\r\nlaments) in the Gregale, a north-east wind. There are several other\r\nterms, such as the Puna of Peru, a very drying wind; the Purgas in\r\nLabrador, the Tourmente in France, and Guxen in Switzerland. Then we\r\nhave the _Hurricane_, from “Ouracan” of the Caribs; the _Typhone_, or\r\nTae-fun of China, so called from the dreaded god Typhon of Egypt; and\r\nthe _Tornado_—all very violent winds, and circling round, causing, so\r\nto speak, whirlwinds, by which trees are uprooted, and houses destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe measure of the velocity of wind is performed by anemometers, which\r\nrecord the velocity in feet per second, and the amount of pressure. The\r\nanemometer is a well-known apparatus, with its four arms terminating\r\nin “cups” and a “tablet” anemometer, which is more or less disturbed\r\nor deflected from the vertical line by each gust of wind, and thus\r\nthe score of degrees is marked by an indicator, which is moved as the\r\ntablet is deflected. We annex a table of wind pressure and velocity—\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE OF THE WIND.\r\n\r\n  +------------------+------------+----------------------+\r\n  |     Velocity.    |Pressure per|                      |\r\n  +---------+--------+  sq. foot. |                      |\r\n  |  Miles  |Feet per|  Rouse and | Description of wind. |\r\n  |per hour.| second.|   Smeaton. |                      |\r\n  +---------+--------+------------+----------------------+\r\n  |    1    |   1·47 |    0·005   | Very gentle.         |\r\n  |    2    |   2·93 |    0·020   |                      |\r\n  |    3    |   4·40 |    0·044   | Light airs.          |\r\n  |    4    |   5·87 |    0·079   |                      |\r\n  |    5    |   7·33 |    0·123   | Light breeze.        |\r\n  |   10    |  14·67 |    0·492   |                      |\r\n  |   15    |  22·00 |    1·107   | Brisk breeze.        |\r\n  |   20    |  29·34 |    1·968   |                      |\r\n  |   25    |  39·67 |    3·075   | Strong breeze.       |\r\n  |   30    |  44·01 |    4·429   |                      |\r\n  |   35    |  51·34 |    6·027   | High wind.           |\r\n  |   40    |  58·68 |    7·873   |                      |\r\n  |   45    |  66·01 |    9·963   | Gale.                |\r\n  |   50    |  73·35 |   12·300   |                      |\r\n  |   60    |  88·02 |   17·715   | Heavy Gale.          |\r\n  |   80    | 117·36 |   31·490   | Hurricane.           |\r\n  |  100    | 146·70 |   49·200   | Tornado.             |\r\n  +---------+--------+------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nThe south-west wind is more constant than any other, and the west\r\nwind in our islands is more frequent than the east; tables have been\r\ncompiled showing the average number of days upon which the winds blow\r\nfrom different quarters, but need not be quoted. Storms can generally\r\nbe anticipated by the barometer, which falls very quickly for “wind.”\r\nThe quarter whence the breeze may be expected is often indicated by the\r\nstreamers of clouds, or “mare’s tails,” across the sky; though we must\r\nadmit the _opposite_ direction to that anticipated by casual observers\r\nmay often prove the right one.\r\n\r\nHurricanes and tornadoes are really whirlwinds in motion. The rotatory\r\nmovement of the air is from right to left in the northern hemisphere,\r\nand from left to right in the southern—that is, in the opposite\r\nand same directions respectively as the hands of a watch move. The\r\nwhirlwinds are caused by two currents of air meeting at a certain\r\nangle, just as a whirlpool is the result of opposing currents of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 716.—Effects of storm at Halligen in 1834.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the wind in nature cannot be over-estimated. It is\r\nfrequently destructive and terrible in its effects, but these\r\ncomparatively trifling damages are as nothing when weighed against the\r\nadvantages conferred upon mankind by the wind and the currents of the\r\natmosphere. The north cold is tempered by the warm south wind. The\r\npollen and the seeds of plants are borne on the wings of the wind, and\r\nthe clouds are carried over the land to “drop fatness” upon our fields.\r\nThe want of free circulation of air is very injurious. Witness the\r\nterrible affliction of _goitre_, so prevalent in the closely shut-in\r\nvalleys such as the Rhone Valley, where cretinism or congenital idiotcy\r\nis distressingly prevalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAPOUR AND CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nVapour, as we have heard, is invisible, and is produced by heat. As the\r\nvisible steam (which is invisible as it issues from the safety valve\r\nat the actual aperture, and nearly invisible altogether on a hot day)\r\nis produced by combustion, so vapour is produced by the heat of the\r\nsun’s rays. But there are some observations to be made respecting these\r\nrays, which are the cause of vapour, and therefore of cloud, rain, dew,\r\nfrost, ice, snow, and water all over the earth; and we must look at the\r\ncircumstances closely.\r\n\r\nThose who have followed us through this volume will remember that at\r\nthe end of Chapter VIII. we remarked upon the spectrum, and made a few\r\nobservations respecting the _heat_ spectrum, and the velocity of light\r\nrays, which became too rapid to be observed, and then they developed\r\nheat—_invisible heat_—produced by non-luminous waves, which proceed\r\nfrom the sun as surely as visible rays or light. Professor Tyndall has\r\nwritten very pleasantly upon this subject, and, with his clear leading,\r\nany reader can study for himself.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the conclusion that there are visible and\r\ninvisible rays giving us respectively light and heat. These latter are\r\nthe means whereby the ice is melted, and by which water is evaporated\r\nto vapour, and formed into CLOUDS when it is chilled or condensed. Here\r\nis another link in the beautiful chain constructed by Nature. We cannot\r\npenetrate far into any portion of the system of the universe without\r\nbeing struck with the wondrous harmony that exists between every\r\nportion of it. Thus heat and light, vapour, cloud, rain, dew, and ice\r\nare all intimately connected.\r\n\r\nA cloud, then, is a visible body of vapour in the atmosphere, which\r\nis supported by an invisible body of vapour. It will remain thus\r\ninvisible so long as the atmosphere is not saturated with moisture.\r\nThe air can contain a great quantity of moisture without its being\r\nrendered visible, and so when the day is hot we see no steam from the\r\nlocomotive. It is absorbed into the dry atmosphere. But when the day\r\nis “damp” we find that the air has nearly as much moisture as it can\r\ncarry, and the steam is condensed, a portion falling in tiny drops like\r\nrain. This is proved every day in cold weather when ice is found in the\r\nwindows—the cold air has condensed and frozen the water breathed out\r\nfrom our lungs, and _snow_ has been known to fall in a ball-room when a\r\ncold current of air was admitted.\r\n\r\nPeople are sometimes apt to think that if the sun were very hot,\r\nglaciers, and such icy masses, would diminish; but we think after what\r\nhas been said respecting the power of the sun’s rays to evaporate\r\nwater, all will see that the contrary is the fact. Without sun-heat we\r\nshould have no cloud, and as clouds give us rain and snow and ice and\r\nglacier, we must come quickly to the conclusion that glaciers and snow\r\nare the direct _results_ of the heat of the sun. The “light” rays of\r\nthe sun do not penetrate snow, and that is why our eyes are so affected\r\nin snowy regions. The poor _Jeannette_ sufferers a short time since\r\nwere blinded by reflected light, and dark spectacles are worn on all\r\nAlpine expeditions. The _invisible_ rays, as we have said, dissolve the\r\nice into rivers.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere produces clouds by expansion of vapour, which chills or\r\ncools it, and it descends as rain. To prove that expansion cools air\r\nis easy by experiment, but if we have no apparatus we must make use of\r\nour mouths. In the body the breath is warm, as we can assure ourselves\r\nby opening our mouths wide and breathing upon our hands. But close the\r\nmouth and blow the same breath outwards through a very small aperture.\r\nIt is in a slight degree compressed as it issues from the lips, and\r\nexpanding again in the atmosphere feels colder. Air compressed into a\r\nmachine and permitted to escape will form ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 717.—Cumulus cloud.]\r\n\r\nWater is present in clouds which assume very fantastic and beautiful\r\nforms. We know nothing more enjoyable than to sit watching the masses\r\nof cumuli on a fine afternoon. The grand masses built up like the Alps\r\nappear to be actual mountains, and yet we know they are but vapour\r\nfloating in the air, and presently to meet with clouds of an opposite\r\ndisposition, and produce a thunderstorm with torrents of rain. Those\r\nwho will devote a few minutes every day to the steady examination of\r\nclouds, will not be disappointed. They give us all the grandeur of\r\nterrestrial scenery. Mountains, plains, white “fleecy seas,” upon\r\nwhich tiny cloudlets float, and low upon the imaginary yet apparent\r\nhorizon, rise other clouds and mimic mountains far and farther away in\r\nnever-ending distance.\r\n\r\nA pretty, light, feathery cloud, with curling tips and fibres, is known\r\nas _cirrus_, and exists at a very great elevation. Gay-Lussac went up\r\nin a balloon 23,000 feet, and even at that height the cirri was far\r\nabove him in space. We can readily understand that at such an extreme\r\nelevation they must be very cold, and they are supposed to consist\r\nof tiny particles of ice. Such clouds as these are very frequently\r\nobserved at night, as cirro-cumulus around the moon, and a yellowish\r\nhalo, apparent to all observers, is thought to be coloured by the icy\r\nparticles of the lofty _cirrus_. The beautiful and varied phenomena of\r\nperihelia, etc., are due also to the snowy or icy flakes of the cirri\r\nand cirri-cumuli, caused by the refraction of light from the frozen\r\nparticles. These cirri clouds are indicative of changeable weather as\r\n“Mares’ tail” skies, and long wisps of cloud, foretelling storm.\r\n\r\nThe _cirro-cumulus_ is the true “mackerel” sky, and is formed by the\r\ncirri falling a little and breaking off into small pieces of _cumulus_,\r\nwhich is a summer (day) cloud generally, and appears in the beautifully\r\nmassive and rounded forms so familiar. The _stratus_ is, as its name\r\nimplies, a cloudy layer formed like strata of rock. It is generally\r\nobservable at night and in the winter. It often appears suddenly in the\r\nsky consequent upon diminished pressure or a rapid fall of temperature.\r\nIt is low-lying cloud sometimes, and at night forms fogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 718.—Cirrus cloud.]\r\n\r\nThe _cirro-stratus_ is perceived in long parallel lines, and indicates\r\nrain; when made-up rows of little curved clouds it is a certain prophet\r\nof storm, and when viewed as haze is also indicative of rain or snow.\r\n“Mock-suns” and halos are often observed in the cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nThe _nimbus_ is the rain-cloud, or condition of a cloud in which rain\r\nfalls from it. It is upon this rain-cloud we can perceive the rainbow,\r\nand on no other cloud, but otherwise only in the sky.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the varieties of cloud and their common origin with\r\nfogs and mists, which differ from them only in the elevation at which\r\nthey come into existence, according to the condition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe uses of clouds are many and varied. Their first and most apparent\r\nuse seems to be the collection and distribution of rain upon the earth.\r\nBut besides this, they shelter us from the too great heat of the sun,\r\nand check the evaporation at night. Supposing we had no clouds we\r\nshould have no rain. If we had no rain the earth would dry up, and the\r\nglobe would appear as the side of the moon appears—a waterless desert.\r\nThe invisible vapour in the atmosphere will produce cloud, but the moon\r\ncan have no atmosphere in that sense. Vapour will also absorb heat, and\r\nintercept the sun’s heat rays, acting much as clouds do in preventing\r\nradiation and great changes of temperature.[33]\r\n\r\nAll animals and plants depend upon moisture in the atmosphere as much\r\nas upon the varying degrees of warmth. A dry east wind effects us\r\nall prejudicially; warm, soft airs influence us again in other ways.\r\nAir will be found drier as a rule in continents than in islands or\r\nmaritime districts, and this will account for the clearness of the sky\r\nin continental regions. Fogs and mists arise when the air is what is\r\ntermed saturated with moisture, and colder than the earth or waters\r\nupon it. So the celebrated and dangerous fogbanks of Newfoundland arise\r\nfrom the warm water of the Gulf Stream, which is higher in temperature\r\nthan the air already saturated. And the same effect is produced when\r\na warm wind blows against a cold mountain; the air is cooled, and\r\ncondenses in cloud.\r\n\r\nThe cooling of the breath by the exterior air is exemplified in winter\r\nwhen we can perceive the vapour issuing from our mouths as we speak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 719.—Storm clouds.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIN, SNOW, AND DEW.\r\n\r\nRain is produced by the condensation of vapour. “Vesicular vapours, or\r\nminute globules of water filled with air,” compose the clouds, and at\r\nlast these vesicles form drops, and get heavy enough to come to the\r\nground. Perhaps they are not sufficiently heavy to do so, and then\r\nthey are absorbed or resolved into vapour again before they can get so\r\nfar, because the lower strata of air are not yet saturated, and can\r\ntherefore contain more moisture.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we may experience rain from a cloudless sky. This is\r\nno very uncommon case, and occurs in consequence of the disturbance of\r\nthe upper strata when warm and cold currents come into collision and\r\ncondense the vapours.\r\n\r\nRain is very unequally distributed. We shall find that the region of\r\ncalms, which we mentioned in a former page, is also the zone of the\r\ngreatest amount of rain. The heated air rises and falls back again,\r\nthere being little or no wind to carry it away. The rainy season,\r\ntherefore, sets in when a place enters the zone of calms. Equatorial\r\ndistricts have two rainy seasons, as they enter twice a year into the\r\nregion of calms, but most places have only a wet and dry season, while\r\nnorth and south of the calm region we find rainless districts, or zones\r\ntempered by the trade winds, which are dry winds.\r\n\r\nBut if we suppose—as indeed is the case in South America—that these\r\ndry winds happen to come in contact with a cool mountain, the moisture\r\nof the air is precipitated in rain. In Australia, on the contrary, we\r\nhave portions of land actually burnt up for want of rain, because the\r\nmountain chain breaks the clouds, so to speak, on a limited corner of\r\nthe island, while the interior is parched. The winds also coming over\r\nIndia from the Bay of Bengal discharge clouds and rain in the Himalayan\r\nslopes. So we perceive that the situation of mountain chains have\r\nmuch to do with the rain-fall, and of necessity, therefore, with the\r\nvegetation and fertility of the land. This is another noticeable link\r\nin the great chain of Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 720.—Meteorological Observatory, Pic du Midi.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may now be understood why westerly and south-westerly winds\r\nbring rain upon our islands, and why the counties such as Westmoreland\r\nand Cumberland and those in Wales receive more rain than any other part\r\nof the United Kingdom. Seathwaite, so well known to tourists in the\r\nlake district, has the proud position of the wettest place in these\r\nislands. We find that when the westerly wind sets in it has come across\r\nthe warm Atlantic water and become laden with moisture, which, when\r\nchilled by the mountains, is precipitated as rain.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rain that falls in the United Kingdom is carefully\r\nmeasured by rain-gauges, some of which are extremely simple. The water\r\nis caught in a funnel-mouthed tube, and measured in a measuring glass\r\nevery four-and-twenty hours. Thereby we can tell the annual rainfall\r\nin any given district, whether it be twenty inches or a hundred. One\r\ninch of rain actually means one hundred tons of water falling upon one\r\nacre of land. Therefore, if the annual report of rainfall (including\r\nall moisture) be twenty inches, we have an aggregate of 2,000 tons of\r\nwater upon every acre of surface within the district. Twenty inches\r\nis a very low estimate. Some places have an annual rainfall of forty\r\nor fifty inches. In Cumberland we find 165 inches has been recorded!\r\nIf we then multiply these last figures we get the enormous quantity of\r\n16,500 tons of water upon every acre of land in the district in one\r\nyear. It is reported from India that in the Khasia Hills the average is\r\n610 inches, which must be the maximum rainfall in the world. At other\r\nplaces, in the north-west provinces, the fall is only seven inches.\r\nSometimes in tropical rains we find fifteen inches of rain in a day,\r\nand that has been exceeded.\r\n\r\nWe can now judge of the enormous amount of moisture carried up by the\r\nsun and dispersed over the earth in rain, which swells our brooks and\r\nrivers, cleanses the air of its impurities, supplies our springs,\r\ncarries with it into the sea lime from the rocks for the shells of\r\nmarine animals, and then leaving its salts, is again evaporated to form\r\nclouds, which discharge the fresh water continually upon the earth in a\r\nnever-ceasing rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW.\r\n\r\n“We all know what SNOW is,” you will say, perhaps. Well, then, will\r\nany ordinary young reader tell me what he knows about snow? “It falls\r\nfrom the sky in white flakes,” says one. “It’s frozen rain,” remarks\r\nanother. “Why, snow _is_ snow,” says a third. “There’s nothing like it;\r\nit’s white rain-water frozen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 721.—Crystals of snow.]\r\n\r\nThe last answer we received is the nearest of all. Snow is not\r\nsnow, paradoxical as that sounds. _Snow is Ice!_ Flakes of snow are\r\nice-crystals—white, because reflecting light. In the section of\r\nMINERALOGY we mentioned crystals, which are certain definite shapes\r\nassumed by all substances, and we gave many examples of them. Just as\r\nalum crystallizes and rock crystal assumes varied and beautiful forms,\r\nso ice crystallizes into six-rayed stars.\r\n\r\nIt is to Professor Tyndall that the world is chiefly indebted for the\r\ndescriptions of snow crystals and ice flowers. In his work upon “Heat\r\nas a Mode of Motion,” this charming writer shows us the structure\r\nof ice flowers. He describes a snow shower as a “shower of frozen\r\nflowers.” “When snow is produced in calm air,” he says, “the icy\r\nparticles build themselves into stellar shapes, each star possessing\r\nsix rays.” We annex some drawings of snow crystals, which are, indeed,\r\nwonderfully made. Hear Professor Tyndall once again:—\r\n\r\n“Let us imagine the eye gifted with a microscopic power sufficient to\r\nenable us to see the molecules which compose those starry crystals: to\r\nobserve the solid nucleus formed and floating in the air; to see it\r\ndrawing towards it its allied atoms, and these arranging themselves as\r\nif they moved to music, and ended by rendering that music concrete.”\r\nThis “six-rayed star” is typical of lake ice also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 722.—Ice crystal.]\r\n\r\nSnow sometimes reaches us in a partly melted condition; under these\r\ncircumstances it is called _sleet_, and snow being much lighter than\r\nrain (ice is lighter than water), it descends less directly, and\r\nrepresents about one-tenth the depth of the rain-fall. The use of snow\r\nin warming the earth is universally acknowledged, and as it is such a\r\nbad conductor, a man in a snow hut will soon become unpleasantly warm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 723.—Ice crystal.]\r\n\r\nIce is only water in another form, and snow is ice; and it is the air\r\nin the snow that gives it warming properties. These are all simple\r\nfacts, which any one by observation and careful reading and study may\r\nsoon ascertain for himself. We have another frozen fall of water from\r\nthe clouds—viz., hail, which may possibly be the development of _sleet_.\r\n\r\nHAIL is formed by the falling rain being frozen in its descent, or when\r\ndifferent currents meet in the atmosphere. A hail-storm is accompanied\r\nwith a rushing sound, as if the hail-stones were striking against each\r\nother. They are very destructive, and actual hail showers occur in\r\nsummer more frequently than in winter, and a peculiarity noticeable\r\nwith regard to hail is its infrequent occurrence during the night.\r\n\r\nRecords of destructive hail storms are plentiful. The hail assumes a\r\ngreat size, weighing sometimes as much as two ounces, and measuring\r\nseveral inches round. Thunder and lightning are very frequent\r\naccompaniments of hail showers.\r\n\r\nDEW is moisture of the atmosphere deposited on a cool surface—another\r\nform of condensation, in fact. Cold water in a tumbler will produce\r\na “dew” upon the _outside_ of the glass when carried into a warm\r\natmosphere. Such is the dew upon the grass. It is produced by the air\r\ndepositing moisture as it becomes colder after a warm day when much\r\nvapour was absorbed. Warm air can hold more water than cold air, and,\r\nthe saturation point being reached, the excess falls as _dew_ at the\r\ndew (or saturation) point. We have previously remarked that one use of\r\nclouds was to prevent rapid radiation of heat which they keep below.\r\nUnder these circumstances—viz., when a night is cloudy—we shall find\r\nmuch less dew upon the grass than when a night has been quite clear,\r\nbecause the heat has left the atmosphere for the higher regions, and\r\nhas then been kept down by the clouds; but on a clear night the air has\r\nbecome cooled rapidly by radiation, and having arrived at saturation\r\npoint, condensation takes place.\r\n\r\nDew does not _fall_, it is deposited; and may be more or less according\r\nto circumstances, for shelter impedes the radiation, and some objects\r\nradiate less heat than others. Hence some objects will be covered with\r\ndew and others scarcely wetted.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the air is very low,—down to freezing\r\npoint,—the particles of moisture become frozen, and appear as\r\n_hoar-frost_ upon the ground. Thus dew and hoar-frost are the same\r\nthing under different atmospheric conditions, as are water and ice and\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nWe have now come round again almost to whence we started. We have\r\nseen the land and water, and the parts that water, in its various\r\nforms, plays upon the land, and its effects in the air as rain, etc.\r\nWe have noticed the winds and air currents as well as the ocean and\r\nits currents. We know what becomes of rain and how it is produced, and\r\nhow the sea works upon the shore, and how clouds benefit us. There are\r\nbesides some less common phenomena which we will now proceed to examine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] _See_ “Molecular Physics” (Tyndall).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. METEOROLOGY (_continued_).\r\n\r\n ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA—THUNDER AND LIGHTNING—AURORA BOREALIS—THE\r\n RAINBOW—MOCK SUNS AND MOCK-MOONS—HALOS—FATA MORGANA—REFLECTION AND\r\n REFRACTION—MIRAGE—SPECTRE OF THE BROCKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of interesting, and to inhabitants of these\r\nislands uncommon,—perhaps we might say fortunately uncommon,—phenomena,\r\nwhich overtake the traveller in other countries. We have referred to\r\nwhirlwinds and tornados, and will now mention two phenomena connected\r\nwith these storms. There is the water-spout, for instance, and\r\nsand-pillars in the desert, which are whirled up by these winds in\r\nspiral columns of water and sand respectively. The tiny whirlwind at\r\ncross-roads, which picks up straws and leaves, is the common appearance\r\nof whirling or crossing currents of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 724.—The Waterspout.]\r\n\r\nWaterspouts, when they are permitted to come near a ship at sea, or\r\nwhen they break upon land, which is seldom, are very destructive. The\r\nwaterspout is begun generally by the agitation of the sea, and the\r\ncloud above drops to meet the water, which at last unites with it, and\r\nthen the column of whirling liquid, tremendously disturbed at the base,\r\nadvances with the prevailing wind. Its course is frequently changed,\r\nand ships within its influence would be speedily wrecked. The only way\r\nto save the vessel is to fire a cannon ball through the column and\r\nbreak it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 725.—Thunderstorm and shower of ashes from\r\nVesuvius.]\r\n\r\nA waterspout once devastated a district in the Hartz mountains of\r\nSaxony. “A long tube of vapour descended to the earth, and several\r\ntimes was drawn upward again; but at last it reached the ground, and\r\ntravelled along at the rate of four-and-a-half miles in eight minutes,\r\ndestroying everything in its way.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion at Carcassonne in 1826, “a reddish column was seen\r\ndescending to the ground, and a young man was caught up by it and\r\ndashed against a rock.” His death was instantaneous.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these whirling winds is supposed to be in the action of\r\nvertical currents of air which ascend heated, and return rapidly as\r\ncold air. The “waterspouts,” etc., are quickly formed. The tornado\r\nis a monster whirlwind like a waterspout in form, and advances at a\r\ntremendous rate—eastward as a rule. It moves in leaps and bounds,\r\npassing over some portions of the ground and descending again. The\r\ncurrent of air is directed to the centre; the cyclone, as mentioned,\r\nhas a spiral or rotatory movement.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning have been, to some extent, described under the\r\nhead of ELECTRICITY, but some observations may also be introduced here,\r\nas storms of that nature appertain to meteorology distinctly.\r\n\r\nElectricity is always present in the atmosphere, and arises from\r\nevaporation and condensation as well as from plants. As the air becomes\r\nmoist, the intensity of the so-called “fluid” increases, and more in\r\nwinter than in summer. Clear skies are positively electric, and when\r\nlarge, heavy clouds are perceived in process of formation in a sky\r\nup to that time clear, a storm is almost certain to follow. These\r\n“thunder clouds,” in which a quantity of electricity exists, attract\r\nor repel each other respectively. The cloud attracts the opposite kind\r\nof electricity to that within it; and when at last a tremendous amount\r\nhas been stored up in the cloud and in the air, or in another cloud,\r\nthe different kinds seek each other, and lightning is the result,\r\naccompanied by a reverberation and commotion of the air strata, called\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nLightning most frequently darts from cloud to cloud, but often strikes\r\nthe ground, whereon and in which are good conductors, such as wet\r\ntrees, metals, running water, etc. The “electric fluid” assumes\r\ndifferent forms—“forked,” “sheet,” and “globular.” The second is\r\nperhaps the most familiar to us, and the third kind is the least known\r\nof all. There are many well-authenticated instances on record in which\r\nlightning with the form and appearance of fireballs has entered or\r\nstruck houses and ships.\r\n\r\n“Fulgarites” are vitreous tubes formed in sandy soils by the lightning\r\nin search of subterranean water-courses, for running water is a great\r\nconductor of electricity.[34] The fire-ball form of lightning has been\r\nknown to enter a school-house where a number of children were, and\r\nto singe the garments of some, killing others. The ball passed out\r\nthrough a pane of glass, in which it bored a hole, breaking every other\r\npane, however, in its transit. Another instance occurred in which the\r\nlightning ran about the floor of a room, and descending the stairs,\r\nexploded without doing any injury.\r\n\r\nLightning, like the electric current of the laboratory, will not\r\nalways set fire even to inflammable objects. An electric spark can be\r\npassed through gunpowder without setting fire to it, and lightning\r\nwill often shatter the object without firing it. Death by lightning\r\nis instantaneous, and in all probability quite painless; for we may\r\nargue from analogy, that as those who have been rendered insensible by\r\nlightning have had no remembrance of seeing the flash which strikes so\r\ninstantaneously, nor of hearing thunder after it, it is instantaneous\r\nin its effects. Besides, the natural attitude is preserved, and the\r\nface is usually peaceful and limbs uncontorted after death by lightning.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious electrical phenomena, such as St. Elmo’s Fire,\r\nalready noticed under ELECTRICITY; and in some parts of America, in\r\nvery hot weather, such a light is perceived to issue from trees as\r\nthe fire glides through the forest. Many instances are on record\r\nconcerning the luminosity of pointed sticks, and even of the tails and\r\nmanes of horses in certain conditions of the atmosphere, and of the\r\nuniversal power of electricity and its pervading influence in nature.\r\nThe benefits conferred by thunderstorms in purifying the air, and in\r\nthe production of ozone and nitric acid, are very great, and apart from\r\nthe magnificent phenomena exhibited, are well worth our attention,\r\nthough beyond our reach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 726.—Aurora Borealis.]\r\n\r\nTerrestrial magnetism, however, is still more puzzling in its action\r\nthan is electricity, and the study of the needle, its destination,\r\ninclination, and intensity, which are marked upon charts, just as\r\nare the weather reports of the _Times_, is an interesting one. These\r\nmagnetic maps are termed the charts of ISOCLINIC and ISODYNAMIC lines.\r\nThe declination of the magnetic needle from the _true_ north is its\r\n_deviation_ from that point, and the “inclination” is its dip towards\r\nthe horizon. The line of its direction being known as the magnetic\r\nmeridian, its divergence from this line constitutes its declination.\r\nThere are places where it does not deviate, and these, in direction\r\nnorth and south, are called lines of “no variation.” There are also\r\nplaces in the equatorial regions where the needle does not “dip.” The\r\nline connecting such places is termed the Magnetic Equator, and north\r\nor south of this the needle dips respectively to north or south in\r\ndegrees coinciding with the distance from the equator.\r\n\r\nThe earth, then, acts as a magnet, and attracts the needle, but the\r\nmagnetic poles are not identical with the terrestrial poles. The north\r\nmagnetic pole was reached in 1831 by Sir James Ross, when the dip was\r\nonly one minute less than 90°, and the south magnetic pole was very\r\nnearly reached also by him in 1840. The magnetic equator passes between\r\nthese two points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 727.—Paraselenæ, or mock moons.]\r\n\r\nIt is to magnetic atmospherical disturbance that the aurora is due.\r\nThese northern (or southern) phenomena are extremely brilliant\r\nand diversified. In temperate regions the aurora does not present\r\nsuch grand forms as in the extreme north. There the spectacle is\r\nastonishingly beautiful. The sky at first clouds over, and mist is\r\ndeveloped. Humboldt has eloquently described the aurora borealis, and\r\nthe beautiful changes of light, the constant movement, flashes, etc.,\r\ndenoting a “magnetic” storm, as electrical discharges indicate an\r\nelectric storm, although the area affected by the former is far more\r\nextensive than that of the latter, and there is no thunder accompanying\r\nthe magnetic storm, with the production of which the electricity of\r\nthe earth is unassociated. To the continuous flow of this electricity\r\nthe aurora is due, and the flashes are only the electric current\r\ndescending towards the earth. But the true reason of the phenomena may\r\nhave to be yet discovered, for nothing absolutely certain is known as\r\nto the origin of the aurora.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous effects of refraction and reflection of light the\r\nRAINBOW is most common and the most beautiful. If we hold a chandelier\r\n“drop” in the sunlight, we shall see a brilliant representation of the\r\nrainbow on the wall or on the carpet. The three colours—red, yellow,\r\nand blue—mingle or shade away into seven—red, orange, green, blue,\r\nyellow, indigo, and violet. These colours are all found in the rainbow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 728.—Parhelia, or mock suns.]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the atmosphere—the usual blue tint of the sky—arises from\r\nthe blue rays of the spectrum being reflected more than the rest by the\r\naerial particles, and the less vapour the bluer the sky, because the\r\nvapour gives it a whitish or misty tint. At sunset and sunrise the sky\r\nis red or yellow, like gold, or of crimson hue. This is because the\r\nsun’s rays have so much farther to come to us at sunrise or sunset, as\r\nyou will readily perceive if you draw a line from the sun to the sides\r\nand then to the top of the arc of the heavens. The blue rays are thus\r\nlost in space, while red and yellow, which travel so much faster than\r\nblue, are transmitted to the eye, not giving the air time to absorb\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf you go under water and look at the sun it will appear very fiery\r\nindeed, and we may likewise imagine that fiery crimson rays, which\r\nbetoken atmospherical disturbance, very often are due to the moisture\r\nthrough which they are transmitted. Wet and storm frequently succeed\r\na crimson sunset, which betokens much moisture in the air. The sun\r\nis similarly seen through the steam issuing from an engine, and the\r\ncolours vary according to the density of the steam in its stages of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 729.—Mirage at sea.]\r\n\r\nVapour, we know, is invisible and transparent, but when it has been\r\ncondensed into rain-drops, and the sun is shining, if we stand with\r\nour backs to the sun we see what we call the rainbow, because a ray of\r\nlight entering the drop is reflected, and as all rays are not of equal\r\nrefrangibility, the light, which is composed of three simple rays, is\r\ndivided and reflected into those and the complementary colours. When\r\nthe sun is at the horizon, the rainbow, to an observer on the earth\r\n(but not on a mountain), will appear to be a semi-circle. The higher\r\nthe sun rises the lower is the centre of the rainbow. So we can never\r\nsee rainbows at noon in summer because the sun is too high. A second\r\nrainbow is not uncommon, the second reflection producing the colours in\r\na different order. The colours in the “original” range from violet to\r\nred; in the “copy” they extend from red to violet. “Rainbows” are often\r\nvisible in the spray of waterfalls and fountains.\r\n\r\nHALOS are frequently observed surrounding the moon, and then we are apt\r\nto prognosticate rain.\r\n\r\n    “The nearer the wane\r\n    The farther the rain,”\r\n\r\nis an old couplet referring to the appearance of the moon, and is\r\nsupposed to foreshadow the weather by the size of the halo, which\r\nis caused, as we know, by the existence of vesicular vapour in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nMOCK SUNS, or _parhelia_, and mock-moons, or _paraselenæ_, are\r\ncontinually observed in cold climates, where the tiny ice particles\r\nare so abundant in the air. These phenomena were recognized by the\r\nancients, and halos round the sun can be observed by means of darkened\r\nglasses. We annex an illustration of a mock sun and moon seen on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. Readers of Mr. Whymper’s “Scrambles in the Alps”\r\nwill remember the gorgeous, and to the guides mysterious, fog-bow or\r\nsun-bow seen as the survivors of the first and most fatal ascent of the\r\nMatterhorn in 1865 were tremblingly pursuing their descent over the\r\nupper rocks of that mountain.\r\n\r\nThe MIRAGE, or _Fata Morgana_, is a very curious but sufficiently\r\ncommon phenomena, and in the Asiatic and African plains it is\r\nfrequently observed. When the weather is calm and the ground hot,\r\nthe Egyptian landscape appears like a lake, and the houses look like\r\nislands in the midst of a widely-spreading expanse of water. This\r\ncauses the _mirage_, which is the result of evaporation, while the\r\ndifferent temperatures of the air strata cause an unequal reflection\r\nand refraction of light, which give rise to the mirage. Travellers are\r\nfrequently deceived, but the camels will not quicken their usual pace\r\nuntil they scent water.\r\n\r\nThe Fata Morgana and the inverted images of ships seen at sea are not\r\nuncommon on European coasts. Between Sicily and Italy this effect is\r\nseen in the Sea of Reggio with fine effect. Palaces, towers, fertile\r\nplains, with cattle grazing on them, are seen, with many other\r\nterrestrial objects, upon the sea—the palaces of the Fairy Morgana.\r\nThe inverted images of ships are frequently perceived as shown in the\r\nillustration (fig. 729), and many most extraordinary but perfectly\r\nauthentic tales have been related concerning the reflection and\r\nrefraction of persons and objects in the sky and on land, when no human\r\nbeings nor any of the actual objects were within the range of vision.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to explain this phenomenon, and the diagrams will\r\nmaterially assist us in so doing, for the appearances are certainly\r\nstartling when realized for the first time. The Spectre of the\r\nBrocken we see mimics our movements, and we can understand it. But\r\nwhen apparently solid buildings appear where no buildings have been\r\nerected,—when we see—as has been perceived—soldiers riding across a\r\nmountain by a path, or ledge, perfectly inaccessible to human beings\r\neven on foot, we hesitate, and think there is something uncanny in the\r\nsight. Let us now endeavour to explain the mirage.\r\n\r\nSuppose that in the annexed diagram the space enclosed between the\r\nletters A, B, C, D, be a glass vessel full of water. The ship is below\r\nthe horizon, the eye being situated at E—the glass vessel of course\r\nrepresenting the atmosphere charged with moisture. The eye at E will\r\nperceive the top of the mast of the ship, S, and we may imagine a\r\nline drawn from E to S. Then put a (short focus) convex lens at _a_\r\njust above this (imaginary) line, and a concave one, _b_, just over\r\nit. Through the former an inverted ship will be seen, and an erect\r\none through the latter at S′ and S″ respectively. We now have the\r\neffect in the air just as reproduced in nature by the difference in\r\ntemperature in air strata, which cause it to act like a concave lens\r\nwhen the density of the water diminishes towards the centre, and like a\r\nconvex lens when it is increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 730.—Explanation of Mirage.]\r\n\r\nThis can be proved by heating the air (by hot irons) above the glass\r\nvessel filled with oil, and the effects will be just the same as\r\nthrough the lenses. Dr. Wollaston obtained the mirage by using a clear\r\nsyrup,—about one-third of the vessel full,—and filling it with water.\r\nThe gradual mingling of these fluids will produce the phenomenon. The\r\nillustration in the margin (fig. 731) shows us the rays proceeding from\r\nthe ship’s hull, and refracted into the line reaching the eye, above\r\nthe line proceeding from the mast, so the ship appears hull uppermost;\r\nthe rays cross at _x_. But if they did not cross before they reach the\r\neye, the image would appear as at _s´_ _p´_ in an erect position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 731.—The Mirage.]\r\n\r\nThe Spectre of the Brocken arises from a different cause. Such\r\nappearances are only shadows,—projected on thin clouds or dense vapours\r\nat sunrise, or when the sun’s rays are directed horizontally,—for of\r\ncourse vertical rays will throw the shadow on the ground on to the\r\nzenith. Balloons are also reflected thus, and much interest has been\r\ncaused by the appearance of a twin balloon, until the aerial voyagers\r\nhave discovered the cheat by seeing the shadowy aeronaut imitating\r\ntheir actions, and the second balloon has been discovered to be an airy\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] “Fulgarites” are composed of melted quartz, and on Mount Ararat\r\nmany have been found which give a character to the formation of the\r\nlesser Ararat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. CLIMATOLOGY.\r\n\r\n WEATHER, CLIMATE, AND TEMPERATURE—ISOTHERMAL LINES—ISOBARS, WEATHER\r\n FORECASTS, AND SIGNS OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is usually considered a sign of a paucity of ideas when one begins\r\na conversation about the “weather,” but there can be no doubt that\r\nthere is no more interesting question in social life at certain times\r\nas to whether it will or will not rain. Our outdoor amusements are all\r\ndependent upon weather, and a little cloud may throw a deep shadow\r\nover all our pleasure if we neglect to bring out an umbrella, or to\r\ncarry a waterproof. We are never independent of what we term the\r\n“capricious” climate, but in reality the laws of “the Weather,” though\r\nso imperfectly understood, are fixed and invariable, and if we could\r\nread the signs in the sky and learn the condition of the atmosphere, we\r\nmight leave the “prayers for rain” and “for fine weather” out of the\r\nChurch service, for then we should understand that unless miracles are\r\nperformed for us the laws of Nature can in no wise be altered.\r\n\r\nOf late years weather forecasts (not prophecies) have come before us\r\nin our newspapers after the manner instituted by the late Admiral\r\nFitzroy, whose name has become a household word in England. But at\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era and before that time the signs\r\nof the heavens and the behaviour of animals and birds were noted with\r\nreference to changes of weather. If we read Virgil we shall find\r\nnumerous references to these portents, and the translation usually\r\nquoted will furnish us with information which must be as true nowadays\r\nas it was in Virgil’s time, for wild animals do not change their\r\nhabits. Speaking of wet weather in the Georgics the poet wrote:—\r\n\r\n    “The wary crane foresees it first, and sails\r\n    Above the storm, and leaves the hollow vales;\r\n    The cow looks up, and from afar can find\r\n    The change of heaven, and sniffs it in the wind;\r\n    The swallow skims the river’s watery face,\r\n    The frogs renew the croaks of their loquacious race;\r\n    The careful ant her secret cell forsakes,\r\n    And draws her eggs along the narrow tracks;\r\n    Huge flocks of rising rooks forsake their food,\r\n    And, crying, seek the shelter of the wood.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The owls, that mark the setting sun, declare\r\n    A starlight evening and a morning fair.”\r\n\r\nWe might quote further selections respecting the signs in the heaven\r\nand earth mentioned, but the foregoing verses will be sufficient to\r\nillustrate our position, and to show us that weather forecasting is, at\r\nany rate, as old as the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe moon is generally supposed to influence the weather—a “Saturday’s\r\nMoon” being particularly objectionable, or when she appears anew at\r\nsome hours after midnight thus—\r\n\r\n    “When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds\r\n    Her silver crescent, tipped with sable clouds,\r\n    Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main,\r\n    And brews for fields impetuous floods of rain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 732.—In the northern Seas.]\r\n\r\nWeather permitting, we can go out and study the clouds as described\r\nin the foregoing chapters, or consult the barometer, and see which\r\nway the wind blows. The child will tell us that a high “glass” means\r\nfine weather, and a low barometer indicates rain, but this is only\r\nrelatively true. A high glass may be falling, a low glass may be\r\nrising. A _sudden_ fall or a _sudden_ rise are indicative of bad,\r\nwindy weather, or a short-lived fine period. The glass may rise with\r\na northerly wind, and rain will supervene, so careful observation is\r\nnecessary before one can obtain even a superficial knowledge of the\r\nweather. (See subsequent observations on “Weather.”)\r\n\r\nThe Americans telegraph the results of their observations of coming\r\nstorms across the Continent, corrected by the signs noticed and\r\nrecorded by vessels arriving in New York. Thus they are frequently very\r\naccurate; steady application and observation at Sandy Hook must give\r\nthem a great deal of useful information for the “forecasts.”\r\n\r\nThe word CLIMATE is derived from the Greek _klima_, a slope; and thus\r\nat a glance we perceive how the aspect it presents to the rays of the\r\nsun in the earth’s revolutions, must affect the “climate” of a country.\r\nOf course the position of any portion, the elevation and locality\r\nof the mountains, have also a share with the soil, winds, rains, and\r\nsea-board, in determining the climate of any region. Many points have\r\nalready been touched upon in former chapters. Temperature, moisture,\r\nand vegetation are the chief natural features which determine climate,\r\nand we must find out the position of the land with reference to the sun\r\nfirst, to ascertain the _climate_.\r\n\r\nThe more vertical the sun is the hotter the atmosphere, for the rays\r\nstrike directly upon the earth, which radiates the warmth received.\r\nThese heat rays are, as we know, invisible. The hottest portion of the\r\nearth must be at the equator for the sun is overhead, and the rays beat\r\ndown directly upon the earth. The sun is also nearer than when at the\r\nhorizon, and less rays are absorbed by the atmosphere. The longer the\r\nday the greater the heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 733.—In the southern steppes.]\r\n\r\nTemperature is registered by observation of the thermometer, and the\r\ndistribution of heat is represented upon a chart across which lines\r\nare drawn at places of equal temperature. These lines are called\r\n“isothermal.” There are also terms to denote equal winter temperature\r\nand the average summer heat—_isochimines_ and _isotheres_ respectively.\r\n\r\nTemperature decreases as we ascend from, and increases as we descend\r\ninto, the earth. This fact proves that the air is not warmed by the\r\nsun’s heat, but by radiation from the ground. As we ascend we reach the\r\nline of perpetual snow, which varies in different parts of the globe.\r\nIn the tropics it extends from 15,000 to 18,000 feet; but it varies\r\neven in places of the same latitude, according as the towns are inland\r\nor on the coast, as in the Pyrenees and Caucasus, where there is a\r\ndifference of three thousand feet in the snow limit.\r\n\r\nThe line of the snow limit, as a rule, gets lower as we journey from\r\nthe equator to the poles. Exception will be found in the Himâlaya,\r\nwhere the snow line is higher on the northern side, in consequence\r\nof the existence of the Thibetan tableland, which causes a higher\r\ntemperature than that existing upon the abrupt southern slope.\r\nCountries, therefore, though in the same latitude, may have different\r\nclimates according to the elevation of the land.\r\n\r\nThe proximity to the sea is another reason for climatic difference.\r\nWater takes some time to become warm, but when it has once become so\r\nit will not readily part with its heat. The Gulf Stream, with its warm\r\ncurrent beating along our shores, gives us a high temperature and\r\na moist climate—a very different condition to Newfoundland or Nova\r\nScotia, which are in much the same latitude as England and Ireland. By\r\nthe sea the climate is more uniform, and the extremes of heat and cold\r\nare not so distant. We send invalids to the seaside to save them the\r\neffects of such violent changes. Winters are milder and summers cooler\r\nby the sea.\r\n\r\nWe can readily understand how such circumstances affect the vegetation,\r\nand places which in winter may enjoy a mild and genial climate\r\n(comparatively speaking), may have a cold summer. Ferns may flourish in\r\nwinter out of doors, but wheat will not ripen in the autumn owing to\r\nthe want of heat.\r\n\r\nThe winds also, and the soil and aspect of a region, all have a share\r\nin determining its climate. Trees bring rain by evaporation, and a\r\nwooded country is a blessing to its inhabitants, defending their\r\nhabitations from wind and avalanches in mountainous districts. But\r\nthe climatic conditions are altering. The ground is being more and\r\nmore cleared; the soil is more cultivated, and moisture is being more\r\neliminated from it. Therefore the air becomes warmer by the radiation\r\nof the ground, and clouds are formed which keep the warm layers down\r\nnearer the earth. Mountains, as we have seen, affect the rain-fall in\r\ndistricts; and in Scandinavia—in Norway chiefly—the average rain-fall\r\nis very high. The sheltering effects of mountains from east or\r\nnortherly winds also alter the climate, while clay or gravel soils are\r\ncold or warm inasmuch as they absorb, or evaporate, moisture. Some\r\nsurfaces being different from others give out more heat.\r\n\r\nIn some mountainous districts we shall find every variety of climate\r\nfrom the sea-level tropical heat to the rigours of the pole. The\r\ngreatest average temperature is north of the equator in Africa; the\r\nlowest in the north, to the west of Greenland. Masses of land act in a\r\ndifferent manner to the oceans, and the former become heated and cooled\r\nwith equal rapidity, while the sea, as already mentioned, is slow to\r\nlose its heat. Our land enjoys a mild and equable climate as a rule,\r\nbecause it is surrounded by water, and the Gulf Stream warms it. The\r\nEuropean climate, taken altogether, may be considered the best on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nWe will now pass on to a few observations concerning the weather, and\r\nthe means of determining it beforehand.\r\n\r\nIt is always a dangerous thing to act the part of a prophet, and the\r\nuncertainty attending an uninspired foreteller’s predictions must in\r\ntime disparage him in the estimation of his hearers and disciples.\r\nBut there are signs in the sky which we can discern and render\r\nvaluable by the aid of instruments. We must have a reliable barometer\r\nand thermometer, and keep a record of the average conditions of the\r\nweather, if we wish to wear the mantle of the weather-prophet—a term\r\nnow, in America, applied (jokingly, no doubt) to people who are not\r\nparticular in their statements of facts.\r\n\r\nBut without entering upon any scientific discussion, we may state a few\r\nplain rules which can be observed, besides the indications of a rising\r\nor falling barometer. Having frequently studied the aspects of the\r\nclouds, with the assistance of the hints from the wind-currents, we can\r\nfairly _prognosticate_ or suggest _probable_ changes of weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 734.—Weather chart.]\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked upon the colours of the sunset, which are\r\nattributable to the vapours in the atmosphere, and we say a red sky\r\nforetells fine weather; a yellow sky changing into green means rain,\r\nor rain and wind; on the other hand, when the red rays appear we may\r\nanticipate fine weather, as the atmosphere is becoming less and less\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nA “low” dawn is known as a good sign; so when the first rays appear at,\r\nor near the horizon, we may anticipate a fine day, as we may when the\r\nmorning is grey.\r\n\r\n  “Evening red and morning grey”\r\n\r\nare almost unfailing tokens of fine weather.\r\n\r\nVery often a yellow sunset means wind; a wild, crimson sky means a\r\ngale. On the afternoon (Saturday) before the _Eurydice_ foundered off\r\nthe Isle of Wight, we particularly noted the sunset at Gravesend; and\r\nit was evident (in our estimation) that a sudden storm was imminent,\r\nand we remarked it to our companions. The sudden fall of the barometer,\r\nand the appearance of the rising clouds early on that sad Sunday\r\nafternoon, approaching in dark masses from the west and north-west,\r\nspoke of rain and (possibly) snow. How true the forecast was the event\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nWhen clouds are soft and thin we expect fine weather; when they are\r\ndark and hard, rain and wind. A ragged-edged and heavy cloud indicates\r\nthunder and lightning, with squalls when we see dark clouds flying\r\nrapidly across the mass of cumuli. A “mackerel” sky and “mares’ tails”\r\ngenerally foretell wind, the direction and the upper currents being\r\nnoted. The longer the warning given by the heavens, the longer the bad\r\n(or fine) weather will last; and the converse is also true.\r\n\r\n    “Evening grey and morning red,\r\n    Put on your hat, you’ll wet your head.”\r\n\r\nThe cirrus is a wispy cloud, and is often observed extending across\r\nthe sky on a fine afternoon. This may or may not indicate rain; it\r\ngenerally points to wind. If its direction be northerly and west to\r\nsoutherly and east, it is a good sign, but from west to east it is\r\na bad sign. The habits of birds and animals, and their anxiety for\r\nshelter, “pigs running with pieces of straw in their mouths,” and the\r\nlow-flying swallow, are all signs of approaching rain and bad weather,\r\nand the scintillation of stars betokens moisture in the atmosphere.\r\nThese are well-known appearances, but there are others regarding the\r\nwinds and currents of air which require the assistance of Admiral\r\nFitzroy’s book.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a falling barometer with rising temperature means\r\nsoutherly winds and rain; in winter, with low temperature, snow.\r\n\r\nBut a rising barometer with northerly wind often means rain.\r\n\r\nA rising glass after a low fall may, and often does, indicate _more_\r\nwind from the north, and after that fine weather, if lower temperature\r\nalso supervene. If warm weather continue under the circumstances, the\r\nwind may back and blow from the southward.\r\n\r\n“The most dangerous shifts of wind happen soon after the barometer\r\nrises from a very low point, or if the wind veers gradually shortly\r\nafter with a rising barometer.”\r\n\r\nIf the barometer rises with a southerly wind fine weather may be\r\nexpected, and if it falls with a northerly wind rain, hail, and snow\r\nare imminent, for the rule is a fall for southerly, and a rise for\r\nnortherly winds.\r\n\r\nA sudden fall with west wind indicates storm from northerly quarters\r\n(N.E. to N.W.). An east gale veering southwards with falling glass\r\nindicates a change of storm-direction to a point from N.W. or N.E.,\r\nsuddenly and violently, though a change might have been expected from\r\nthe appearance of the glass. A calm frequently occurs between these\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nA backing wind—that is, a wind going in a direction opposed to the\r\nsun’s course (and with the earth)—is a bad sign after unsettled\r\nweather. The wind is said to “veer” when it goes _with_ the sun.\r\n\r\nThe south-east wind, with clear sky, warm weather, and low clouds on\r\nthe horizon, is a sign of wet. A dry east wind means fine weather.\r\nHeavy clouds in the north-west generally bring a thunderstorm. When\r\nreally distant objects look very near rain must be expected.\r\n\r\nThere are many exceptions to weather rules, and none can be laid down\r\nas invariable. The ever-changing currents of air, and varying moisture\r\nof the atmosphere, give rise to barometric changes, which should be\r\ncarefully noted. A little experience and close observation for one\r\nyear, with notes of signs, and indications of temperature, will assist\r\nany one to tell the probable change that is approaching.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of signs of weather which are observable in\r\nthe animal and even in the vegetable kingdom, as well as in the moon\r\nand stars. Many flowers close their petals before rain comes on, and\r\nthe behaviour of domestic animals often foretells storm. Sheep huddling\r\ntogether in a corner tell us the direction from which the tempest is\r\napproaching; sea birds fly to shore, and land birds become restless.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist will observe the domestic animals which become\r\nuncomfortable and sniff the air; the cat lies with her head down,\r\nthe brain lowest; and frequently washes her face, or scampers about\r\naimlessly. Spiders disappear, and worms come up to seek the expected\r\nwater. When fine weather is coming all nature appears glad, but leeches\r\nsink into the water as far as they can.\r\n\r\nThe above are some of the domestic and common signs of coming rain,\r\nand conversely for fine weather. A wailing wind, a cloudy mountain, a\r\ngreenish rainbow or too red a one, a pale moon with indistinct points,\r\nor a halo round it, are all signs of rain and possibly wind. So the\r\nmost superficial observer may with these few suggestions inform himself\r\nof the chances of fine or wet weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY. PART I. BOTANY.\r\n\r\n PLANTS AND ANIMALS—STRUCTURE OF PLANTS—FLOWERING PLANTS—THE STEM—THE\r\n LEAVES—FORMS OF LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY is derived from the Greek word _Bios_, “life,” and _logein_,\r\n“to speak,” and constitutes the science of ORGANIC LIFE. This science\r\nis divided into two branches: BOTANY, relating to the life of plants;\r\nZOOLOGY, to the animals.\r\n\r\nPlants, then, are living things, and as we proceed we shall find them\r\nborn, or “germinating,” growing up as young plants, maturing as adults,\r\nand finally dying, and their particles resolving into their elements.\r\nThere is more than one application of the text, “Man is but as a flower\r\nof the field.”\r\n\r\nIn the GEOLOGICAL section we noticed the progressive stages of the\r\nvegetable creation, and if we turn back to those pages wherein the\r\nvarious epochs of the earth’s formation are enumerated, we shall see\r\nhow plant-life developed. Thus we find in the Cambrian the first traces\r\nof vegetable life in the weeds of primeval seas. The Silurian strata\r\nand the Devonian furnish us with many fossils of marine algæ, and if\r\nwe examine the succeeding periods we shall find a progressive increase\r\nand development; pines and tree-ferns in the sandstone, and most of the\r\nplants (by which term we include all varieties) were different from\r\nthose at present existing in the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 735.—Branch of the oak.]\r\n\r\nWe spoke of climate lately, and referred to the vegetation having an\r\ninfluence upon it. The same is true of the effect of climate upon\r\nvegetation. The conditions of plant-life depend upon climate, as it\r\npartly depends upon plant-life. But of all the necessary conditions\r\nthe first created thing is the most necessary—light. Without light the\r\nplant is nothing.\r\n\r\nPlants have many points of similarity with animals. They live, they\r\npossess organs, their compositions contain similar substances, such\r\nas carbon and albumen, and close chemical analyses have found the\r\nexistence of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon in\r\nanimals and plants. Therefore water must play a conspicuous part in\r\nall. Professor Huxley puts this question in his usual clear fashion. He\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 736.—The pine.]\r\n\r\n“It is a very remarkable fact that not only are such substances as\r\nalbumen, gluten, fibrin, and syntonin known exclusively as products of\r\nanimal and vegetable bodies, but that every animal and every plant at\r\nall periods of its existence contains one or other of them, though in\r\nother respects the composition of living bodies may vary indefinitely.\r\nThus some plants contain neither starch nor cellulose, though these\r\nsubstances are found in some animals; while many animals contain no\r\nhorny matter and no gelatine-yielding substance. So that the matter\r\nwhich appears to be the _essential_ foundation of both the animal and\r\nthe plant, is the _proteid_ united with water, though it is probable\r\nthat in all animals and plants these are associated with more or\r\nless fatty and amyloid (starchy and saccharine) substances, and with\r\nvery small quantities of certain mineral bodies, of which the most\r\nimportant appear to be phosphorus, iron, lime, and potash. Thus there\r\nis a substance composed of water, _plus_ proteids, _plus_ fat, _plus_\r\namyloids, _plus_ mineral matters, which are found in all animals and\r\nplants. When these are alive this substance is termed PROTOPLASM.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 737.—The fir.]\r\n\r\nWe have taken the liberty to extract the above paragraph, as it\r\nexpresses in a few words, and very clearly, the common origin of plants\r\nand animals. We will now consider the conditions of plant life. Heat,\r\nlight, and moisture are the principal necessaries, with of course air\r\nand certain earthy matter. Some plants, like some few animals, live\r\nin darkness, such as truffles and fungi, as do cave-fish and bats.\r\nBut this is the exception, and the sense in which plants (or animals)\r\ncan exist without light is a very restricted one, and only to be\r\nsustained at the expense of the plant material, which must originally\r\nhave been derived by the action of light. Light, therefore, is the\r\ngreat “producer.” It gives life to plants upon which animals feed, and\r\ntherefore light is in one sense the beginning of all things. We can now\r\nunderstand why light must have been created first.\r\n\r\nMany interesting experiments can be made to observe the effect of\r\ndarkness and different coloured light (transmitted through coloured\r\nglasses) upon plants; and it will be observed that although the leaves\r\nmay not develop the natural green tint, the flowers will exhibit their\r\nusual colour. One effect of light upon plants is to make them green.\r\n\r\nWe all admire the beautiful green of the spring leaves, and the\r\nfreshness of the colours of the trees and grass. But if we pluck up\r\na plant its root is not green. Why then is the cleaned root not as\r\ngreen as the upper portion?—Because of the absence of light. There\r\nis a substance called _Chlorophyl_ which, _when acted upon by light,\r\nbecomes green_. This is contained in plants, and when the daylight\r\nfalls upon it the substance turns green. So, as we said above, plants\r\nare not green when kept in the dark. Celery is a common instance. Heat,\r\nof course, has much to do with the activity or vitality of plants, and\r\nthe range extends from just above freezing point to 122° Fahr. We find\r\ntiny plants blossoming in Alpine regions close to the snow, and others\r\nin full life in the tropics, protected from the fierce rays by scaly\r\ncoverings and huge leaves. In the northern regions buds appear as soon\r\nas the surface warmth is felt, and even when no heat can yet penetrate\r\nto the roots. Thus we see that Nature fits the animal and the plant to\r\nthe localities in which they live, and they exist interdependently.\r\nSome can defy cold, others flourish in drought; some love moisture,\r\nothers live in great heat encased in prickly armour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 738.—Branch of elm.]\r\n\r\nWith this introduction to biology we may now pass on to speak of the\r\nseeds and germination of plants, which we divide into the flowering and\r\nnon-flowering species. We suppose that the appearance of various organs\r\nof plants are familiar to our readers, and the _root_, the _stem_, the\r\n_leaves_, and the _flower_ itself, as well as the _seeds_, are well\r\nknown, and their uses understood generally.\r\n\r\nNow if we compare a mineral—say a crystal of quartz—with a plant, we\r\nfind the crystal uniform, consisting of small particles of quartz\r\nthroughout, and it appears an aggregation from outside of these\r\nparticles in a particular form. It cannot grow from within. But a plant\r\ncan; and it is very different in structure and appearance. It receives\r\nnourishment from outside also, but it _assimilates_ the materials,\r\nwhich are not the same as those we meet with in the plant itself. The\r\nmineral, on the contrary, is essentially the same throughout; it can\r\nonly grow by aggregation of atoms like itself. A plant, therefore, like\r\nan animal, must have organs within it, and must be capable of change\r\nin itself; it has powers of reproduction, and in some few instances of\r\nlocomotion; it can eat flies, and assimilate them as an animal does.\r\n\r\nA plant, therefore, is an organized body without external voluntary\r\nmovement; and hereby it is essentially distinct from an _animal_, with\r\nwhich, in organization, it is closely connected. The simplest form\r\nof the animal as of the plant, is that of a minute vesicle or cell,\r\ncontaining a fluid in which are some granular substances. At this stage\r\nit could not be distinguished from the simplest plant, if it had not\r\nthe faculty of voluntary movement—the power of changing its place. The\r\nanimal has a locomotive power. Sometimes, indeed, it is a very limited\r\nsphere to which it is confined; yet it may change its place for another\r\nmore conducive to the exigencies of its being.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for the present to have given the most general\r\ncharacteristics by which plants are distinguished from the other\r\nobjects that, with them, compose the great kingdom of Nature. A precise\r\nand clear apprehension of their varied forms and wonderful phenomena\r\ncan only be obtained by a careful analysis of the nature and structure\r\nof the subjects of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe _cell_ is the fundamental or elementary organ of plants, and the\r\nknowledge of its metamorphoses and functions constitutes the foundation\r\nof botany. We must therefore first consider the simple organs of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary for the reader to gain some little knowledge of\r\nthe tissues and cells of plants before he proceeds to examine the\r\norgans of development, and a microscopic examination will soon disclose\r\nthe few simple tissues which are termed cells and vessels. These exist\r\nin all plants of whatever nature. Plants are aggregations of cells,\r\n“every one of which has its little particle of _protoplasm_ enclosed\r\nby a casing of the substance called _cellulose_, a non-nitrogenous\r\nsubstance nearly allied in chemical composition to starch.”[35] The\r\ntissues are “cellular” and “vascular” respectively.\r\n\r\nThe cells have an outer _sac_ or covering which is transparent, and\r\nthis cover is the _cellulose_ above mentioned. It contains (1) the\r\n_protoplasm_, a kind of jelly-like substance (which holds the proteine\r\nor basis of life); (2) water or cell-sap; (3) the nucleus; and (4)\r\nchlorophyl. This protoplasm is apparent in both plants and animals.\r\nThe cells containing these various substances—in which we find oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, and carbon, with phosphorus perhaps—are\r\ndivided to form new cells, and so on with most astonishing rapidity,\r\namounting in some instances to millions in a day, and a case of this\r\nnature will readily be recognized in the mushroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A B C\r\n\r\nFig. 739.—Plant cells.]\r\n\r\n_Cellular tissue_ is composed of these cells, and _vascular tissue_\r\nis composed of vessels or tubes like coiled springs, which are cells\r\nwithout divisions or partitions. These tissues will be referred to\r\nfarther on as dotted ducts or tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 740—Form of cells.]\r\n\r\nIn most of the spongy parts of plants, as in the pulp of fruits\r\nand pith of elder, the cells preserve the globular or oval shape\r\nrepresented in fig. 739 A. But the cells, in consequence of that mutual\r\npressure, more frequently assume the form of a polygon (fig. 739 B),\r\nthe section of which is generally hexagonal. The cellular tissue may\r\ngenerally be compared to the bubbles produced by blowing through a\r\nstraw or tobacco-pipe into soap and water; or it may be illustrated by\r\nplacing balls of moist clay together, and then pressing them more or\r\nless strongly. In this manner every individual ball assumes a polygonal\r\nshape corresponding to the form of the cells represented in fig. 739\r\nC, and which disposition is, in many plants, preserved with the utmost\r\nregularity. Such cells as are, with tolerable equality, extended in\r\nall directions, are named _parenchyma_, and of these are composed\r\nthe tuberous parts of plants, as the potato, dahlia-roots, etc., and\r\nespecially the soft, spongy parts of the pith, bark, leaves, etc. We\r\nfrequently, however, meet with cells which are extended longitudinally,\r\nand pointed at both extremities, as in fig. 740. The sections of these\r\ncells, which are compactly arranged, have the appearance of a hexagon.\r\nThey are termed _woody cells_, or _woody tissue_ (prosenchyma), and\r\nconstitute the chief portions of the more solid parts of plants, as\r\nthe ligneous parts of trees, shrubs, etc. Very long, flexible cells,\r\nas those which constitute the fibres of flax and hemp, are called\r\n_bast-cells_, and appear under the microscope as round threads of\r\nuniform thickness, whereas the fibres of cotton wool, which rarely\r\nexceed one or two inches in length, when magnified, present the\r\nappearance of flattish bands with somewhat rounded margins. By these\r\nmarks, the union of flax and cotton in the same web or piece of cloth\r\nmay be detected.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the cells assume very abnormal shapes, as the stellate or\r\nstar-formed cells. These are described as _irregular cells_.\r\n\r\nAs every plant, whether small or great, is only an aggregate of a great\r\nnumber of cells, so, also, the life of a plant is nothing else but the\r\nsum of the activities of all the cells of which it is composed. The\r\nspecial province of the cells is to receive from the soil or atmosphere\r\nthe water necessary for the various vegetative purposes, together with\r\nthe nutritious materials dissolved in the watery and aerial fluids, and\r\nto circulate them through the whole body of the plant. The circulation\r\nwithin a plant is not carried on through the agency of tubular\r\nchannels, but only by the passage of sap in all directions from one\r\ncell to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 741.—Vascular tissue.]\r\n\r\nSince the cells have no openings, it is somewhat difficult to\r\nunderstand in what manner the fluid can enter into the plant from\r\nwithout, and by what means it can inwardly pass from cell to cell.\r\nThis phenomenon, however, is dependent on the peculiar quality both\r\nof vegetable and animal membranes and fibres—viz., that they are\r\npermeable by many fluids, without being dissolved by them. Experiments\r\nshow that this permeative action is carried on in accordance with\r\ndefinite laws. When two fluids of _unequal densities_—as, for example,\r\nan aqueous solution of sugar and mere water—are separated from\r\neach other by a diaphragm of pig’s bladder, we perceive a constant\r\ntendency on both sides to restore the equilibrium in the density of\r\nthe two fluids. A portion of the water penetrates the bladder, mixing\r\nwith the solution, and a portion of the latter finds its way to the\r\nformer by the same medium. In this experiment one important fact is\r\nto be observed—viz., that the lighter fluid always passes through\r\nthe separating medium more rapidly to the denser than _vice versâ_;\r\nconsequently, in this experiment more of the water passes through the\r\nbladder to the saccharine solution than of the latter to the water.\r\nThis permeative capability of the tissue of vegetables and animals is\r\ncalled _endosmose_.\r\n\r\nThe cells both circulate the sap and alter its condition, so we find\r\ndiffering substances in the same plant. The cell as described creates\r\nnew cells, and the force with which the sap rises is rather greater\r\nthan the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe vascular, or fibrous tissues, are illustrated in the margin (fig.\r\n741). They usually contain air. Some plants have no vascular tissue,\r\nand are termed cellular plants—such as mushrooms, fungi, mosses, and\r\nseaweeds. Many contain both tissues, and these are the more highly\r\ndeveloped kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 742.—Cells of epidermis (leaf).]\r\n\r\nSometimes we find a milky juice in plants. This is called _latex_; and\r\ncaoutchouc is always present in it. This juice is contained in tiny\r\ntubular vessels, which have their origin in the new cellular tissue of\r\nthe lactiferous plants.\r\n\r\nThe tissue of the cuticle, or _epidermis_, which externally covers all\r\nparts of the plant while they remain green, is of a peculiar nature,\r\nand demands special consideration. It is formed of flat tubular cells,\r\nvery much compressed, and in close contact, with the exception of\r\nsome parts where the _stomata_, or mouths, are placed. In fig. 742\r\na section of the leaf is represented, the large transparent empty\r\ncells of the epidermis, and above these the parenchymatous cells\r\nof the leaf filled with greenish-coloured granules. In four places\r\n(fig. 743) stomata (_s s s s_) are seen, which have their openings\r\nsurrounded by parenchymatous cells disposed in semilunar forms. Under\r\neach stoma (mouth) there is a hollow space which is connected with the\r\nintercellular passages of the leaf. These stomata, represented in fig.\r\n743, are so numerous on the under side of the leaf, that hundreds have\r\nbeen counted in the space of a square line. Through these minute organs\r\nan intimate connection exists between the interior of the plant and the\r\nexternal air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 743.—Stomata.]\r\n\r\nThe epidermal cells not unfrequently exhibit very abnormal formations.\r\nWhen much extended in length they appear as _hairs_ which are\r\nfrequently branched, and in many plants they contain an irritating sap\r\n(in the nettle, for example). Bristles, prickles, glands, warts, and\r\nespecially the substance which forms the well-known cork, are all due\r\nto the metamorphosis of this exterior integument.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 744.—Water lily.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 745.—Transformation of petals into stamens in white\r\nwater lily.]\r\n\r\nFlowering plants have certain distinct features which cannot be\r\nmistaken, for they grow well above ground, and can easily be examined.\r\nThere are a hundred-thousand different species of flowering plants, and\r\na visitor to Kew can study them there. Any child can tell a flower when\r\nhe sees it, but a _flowering plant_ is no more restricted in BOTANY to\r\nactual bright blossoming plants, than the term _rock_ in GEOLOGY means\r\na mass of stone only. Flowering plants may be either very gorgeous or\r\nvery simple; and so long as _they contain a reproductive apparatus_\r\nthey are flowering plants. The rose is a flowering plant, but the oak\r\nis equally one. The beech tree and the primrose are classed under the\r\nsame heading.\r\n\r\nFlowering plants must possess _stamens_ and _pistils_, which bring\r\nforth _seeds_ which contain an embryo, and the germination of seeds\r\ncan be easily perceived by any one who will take the trouble to soak\r\nthem (say “scarlet runners”) in warm water, and keep them warm in moist\r\nflannel. The process may then be examined at leisure.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly insist, after what we have said, upon the necessity for\r\nsome air and light, or remind the reader that he must not keep the\r\nseeds in a close, dark place, though light is not so necessary at first\r\nas air. The embryo connects the “cotyledons” or halves of the seed,\r\nand this develops into a tiny rootlet or “radicle,” and upwards into\r\nthe stem, the commencement of which is known in botany as a “plumule.”\r\nThe rootlet seeks nourishment from the ground. The albumen secreted in\r\nthe cotyledons feeds the embryo, until (in some cases) it is exhausted\r\nand they die away. In other cases they grow up and obtain food for\r\nthe young plant in the air. Some plants have (like wheat) only one\r\nseed-leaf, or cotyledon; and these kinds are called monocotyledons,\r\nor _endogens_, in which the growth is upright. The others are called\r\ndicotyledons, or _exogens_.\r\n\r\nSo far now, perhaps, you may understand that the outer covering of the\r\nseed is called the _testa_; the opening which may be perceived in the\r\nordinary bean near the dark spot is the _micropyle_, or little gate;\r\nthat the halves of the covering are termed _cotyledons_, or cups, and\r\nthat the embryo sprouts upwards and downwards, the upper part of the\r\nstem being the plumule, and the lower portion the radicle. Even if the\r\nseed be put micropyle upwards into the ground, or between layers of\r\nflannel, to germinate, you will find that the radicle will always curve\r\n_downwards_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 746.—Pistils of violet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 747.—Tetradynamous stamens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 748.—Polyadelphous stamens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 749.—Pistil of primrose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 750.—Diadelphous stamens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 751.—Fibrous root.]\r\n\r\nThe root then being displayed, it pushes its way into the ground to\r\nseek for nourishment, and when the proper moisture has been admitted to\r\nthe seedling, which has been reposing in the cotyledons all the time,\r\nit sprouts up rapidly. The root and its fibrous extremities have been\r\npushing and insinuating themselves into and through the ground, and by\r\nsmall knobs or suckers known as _spongioles_, the rootlets or fibrous\r\nparts of the root pick up sustenance for the plant, and it is then\r\ncarried by tubes to the root, and so on throughout the plant, and with\r\nair ducts serve to keep the plant alive.\r\n\r\nThe stem emanates from the _plumule_, and in a short time little knots\r\ndevelop upon it, which are the incipient leaves. The knots are divided\r\ninto nodes and internodes, because they appear on different sides of\r\nthe stem and intermediate, so as to alternate with each other, and are\r\nreally buds. The issues unite also into leaf-stalks or _petioles_,\r\nand extend into the leaf-frame or skeleton as we see it when the leaf\r\nhas decayed. So thus we have an upward and a descending growth, which\r\nrespectively constitute the stem and root of a flowering plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 752.—Tuberous (fasciculated) root.]\r\n\r\nSome trees have roots growing from the stem, as in the banyan tree,\r\nand roots can produce stems as well as the latter can form roots. The\r\nuses of roots are so well understood that we need not particularize\r\nthem. In many trees we find what are termed _lenticellæ_, like holes\r\nin the bark. These fissures will put forth roots under favourable\r\ncircumstances. These stem roots are called adventitious, and by taking\r\n“cuttings” from plants we make good use of them for propagation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 753.—Banyan tree.]\r\n\r\nBut there are underground stems as well as those which flourish and\r\nclimb above it. “Bulbs” and “tubers” are common instances of these\r\nunderground stems, or “rhizoma,” which are horizontal. The ordinary\r\nstems are termed “aerial” stems to distinguish them from the earthy\r\nand subterranean. The aerial roots of ivy are only used for support,\r\nand are not its proper roots, though some parasitic plants strike into\r\nthe trees and are nourished by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEM.\r\n\r\nThe stem is that portion of the plant-axis which grows upwards or above\r\nground, and may be, as we have just read, subterranean. As the great\r\nfunction of the root is to procure sustenance for the plant, the stem\r\nassists in carrying the nourishment through the branches and leaves. We\r\nshall find two forms of stem—the underground, or root-stock, and the\r\nstem proper. There are in these two former several varieties as under:—\r\n\r\n1. The BULB, which is a short globular stem surrounded by thick leaves,\r\nand producing buds—as, for example, the onion.\r\n\r\n2. The TUBER, similar to the foregoing in shape, having no leaves,\r\nhowever; the potato is an instance.\r\n\r\n3. The RHIZOME (root-stock), like a root only producing buds, which\r\nroots do not. The iris will serve as an example.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the stem-proper are:—\r\n\r\n (1) _Filiform_, or thread-like, simple, or branched, as in mosses.\r\n\r\n (2) The _culno_, a thin, hollow, and frequently-jointed stem.\r\n\r\n (3) The _palm_ or simple stem, seen in tree-ferns and palms. It is\r\n marked by the scars of dropped leaves.\r\n\r\n (4) The _stalk_, very common, of a green hue, and its life is limited\r\n to a twelve-month as a rule. The so-called “stem” of the hyacinth\r\n is not a stem, it is a stalk, or flower-stalk, pushed forth for a\r\n temporary purpose.\r\n\r\n (5) The _ligneous_ stem is the perfected kind, and an example will be\r\n apparent in every tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 754.—Transverse section of exogenous wood, showing the growth of\r\n nine years.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 755.—Section (magnified portion) of the small cut\r\n_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 756.—Section of an endogenous stem.]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the stem of a plant is usually the same as of the\r\nplant—so we have annuals, biennials, and perennials. The substance of\r\nthe stem determines its character, so we may have it solid, or soft,\r\nhollow, tubular, flexible, rigid, or a tough stem. There are fibrous,\r\nherbaceous, and juicy stems. They may be directed uprightly, straight,\r\nprocumbently, arched, or creeping, above, or underground, climbing,\r\nclinging, floating, or twining.\r\n\r\nThere are many plants with little or no stem deserving the name, as in\r\nthe onion; and we must all remember when studying botany that it is not\r\nthe _place_ where a portion of a plant may be found that constitutes\r\nit a root or a stem. The form and structure should be studied, and its\r\npurpose in creation. So stems may be underground and roots above it.\r\nThe root and stem, briefly treated of in the foregoing paragraphs, have\r\ncertain points of resemblance, inasmuch as both consist of a main or\r\ntrunk line, so to speak, from which branches diverge as “rootlets” and\r\n“twigs”; and how beautiful the latter are any one can see in a good\r\nphotograph of a wintry landscape. But stems have nodes and internodes,\r\nand roots have not, and this is the great and apparent difference.\r\n\r\nThe covering of plant-stems is varied, and many instances of such\r\nclothing will occur. We have woolly stems and hairy stems, which\r\ndevelop into thorny ones—for thorns are only strong hairs. Spines\r\nand stings and prickles defend the stems, and keep rude hands from\r\nmeddling. We will now cut the stem and see what it is composed of,\r\nand how it looks inside. We have only to cut it across and again\r\nperpendicularly to find out a great deal about the interior structure\r\nof the stems of branching plants (exogens).\r\n\r\nThe elder, from which the whistle of our boyish days is fashioned with\r\na penknife, will serve any lad for an illustration. Inside we find what\r\nis called “pith,” which is _cellular tissue_. Round this is fibre, and\r\noutside is a skin, or the plant-cuticle. We may remark that the tissues\r\nof flowering plants are characteristic of the monocotyledonous and\r\nthe dicotyledonous plants. Of the former we append an illustration,—a\r\nsection of palm-stem,—and we find bundles of vascular tissue dispersed\r\napparently at random amongst the cellular tissue of the parenchyma,\r\nor cellular tissue. These stems do not grow by the increase of\r\nthe existing vascular tissue, but by their new production at the\r\ncircumference, and so they grow in both directions, laterally and\r\nuprightly. These plants belong to the ENDOGENS, and if Indian corn be\r\ngrown we shall have full opportunity to study the formation. In cutting\r\na fern stem we are familiar with the “oak” pattern of the matter it\r\ncontains. We have few specimens of endogens in England.\r\n\r\nThe dicotyledonous stems are common to our trees and most plants, and\r\nmay therefore be considered with advantage. The stem consists of the\r\nvascular tissue called “pith,” and we give an illustration of the cells\r\nmagnified very considerably. The arrow indicates the outward direction\r\n(fig. 757).\r\n\r\nWe here perceive the vascular bundle proper surrounded by a very\r\nlarge-celled tissue, _aa′bef_. The almost square cells, _aa′_ , form\r\nthe epidermis on which follows the less dense cellular tissue of the\r\nbark. The latter surrounds a half-moon-shaped bundle of bast-cells,\r\n_c_, which are separated in the direction towards the interior, by\r\na layer of cambium, _dd′d″_, from the bundles of vascular tissue,\r\nconsisting of vessels and longitudinal cells. The latter tissues may be\r\ndistinguished in the transverse section by the thicker walls, _gg_, and\r\nby their greater breadth, _hh_. It is further to be remarked that the\r\ncambium transparent tissue, _dd″_, appears on both sides of the bundles\r\nof vascular tissue, and extends to the next bundle, and thus presents\r\nan uninterrupted circle throughout the entire circumference of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 757.—Dicotyledonous stem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 758.—Stem one year old.]\r\n\r\nOn examining the section of a one-year-old dicotyledonous stem,\r\nmagnified six times, as in fig. 758, we perceive several parts clearly\r\ndistinguishable from each other, corresponding with the arrangement of\r\nthe bundles of vascular tissue.\r\n\r\nEnclosed by the epidermis, _a_, is a large-celled tissue, _b_ _f_ and\r\n_m_, in which a number of vascular bundles form a circle. In each of\r\nthese we notice that the outer portion, consisting of bast-shell, _c_,\r\nis separated by the cambium, _d_, from the inner woody portion, _e_.\r\nThe cambium forms a closed circle which penetrates through all the\r\nvascular bundles.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the further development of the stem, the parts, _a_\r\n_b_ _c_, constitute the _bark_, the vascular bundles, _e_, the _wood_,\r\nand the cellular tissue, _f_, its pith. The tissues, _m_, penetrating\r\nbetween the vascular bundles, are called the _medullary rays_. The\r\ncambium is to be regarded as the most important part, since it is the\r\nsource of new bundles of vascular tissue which year by year increase\r\nthe circumference of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 759.—Stems three and five years old.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of a dicotyledonous stem is continued by the formation of a\r\nnew circle of vascular bundles on the circumference of the stem in the\r\nsecond year. Each new bundle, as has already been shown, is produced in\r\nthe cambium, and consequently is deposited between the wood and inner\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nThus every year a new layer is deposited between the previous formation\r\nand the bark; and a section will exhibit these concentric rings of\r\nwood obviously distinct from each other; and as one year is requisite\r\nfor the formation of a single layer of wood, these depositions are\r\nnamed _annual layers_ or _rings_. In fig. 759 we have a representation\r\nof a stem three years old, and one of five years of age.\r\n\r\nThe number of rings in the stem do not invariably agree with the number\r\nof years the tree has been growing, but it may be accepted as a rule.\r\n\r\nThe stem is the medium of communication between the roots and leaves\r\nat first; but after a year this important duty is deputed to the\r\ncambium layers of new woody tissue, etc., and as time goes on the\r\nliving power has accumulated immediately under the bark. So although\r\nthe tree be quite hollow it will live. The interior has been closed up\r\nby deposition of wood and has decayed; but the life functions being\r\nrelegated to the bark, the old tree lives on. If we remove the rind all\r\nround a tree it will die.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAVES.\r\n\r\nWhen in the spring the young leaves appear upon the trees, and as\r\nsummer advances they become fully developed, we are all grateful for\r\nthe beautifully varied tints of green, and for the shade we can so\r\nfully enjoy. The study of leaves is a most interesting and instructive\r\none, and nobody should omit to examine them. Their forms are infinite,\r\nor, at any rate, countless; their size as varied as their forms.\r\nMany attributes of the leaf will occur to every reader, and we will\r\nbriefly describe these essential organs of plants. Air and light are\r\nnecessary to the development of leaves, and their principal use is to\r\npresent a surface to the food material which the plant absorbs. They\r\nbreathe, as it were, and absorb the carbonic acid from the atmosphere.\r\nThese functions are called “assimilation,” “transpiration,” and\r\n“respiration,” which we will detail by-and-by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 760.—Compound leaf.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 761.—Simple leaf.]\r\n\r\nLeaves are distinguished according to position and duration. Some\r\nleaves have very simple forms, others are compound, so to speak. Some\r\nare plain and rounded, others are toothed, like the holly. The skeleton\r\nof a leaf is a very interesting study, and it will show the beautiful\r\nstructure of these common objects. The delicate lines of the green leaf\r\nare “veins,” or sap-vessels, which convey the necessary nourishment.\r\nThe leaves are called the “embryonic” (seed-like), the radicle, or\r\nroot-leaf, the stalk-leaf, and the stipules, which grow at the base of\r\nstem-leaves, and the floral leaves, which bear the flowers or fruit\r\nbuds. Leaves which are developed at the end of a chief axis are termed\r\n_blossoms_. Of course it must be understood that all the different\r\nkinds of leaves do not occur upon the same plant. The leaf may be\r\naccepted to mean the stem-leaf.\r\n\r\nLeaves are folded up in various ways, and the manner in which this\r\nis accomplished is termed the _vernation_ of the plant. The leaves\r\nof endogens and exogens differ in their veining. The former veins\r\ndo not touch; there is none of that beautiful interlacing which we\r\nfind in the exogenous leaves. In the former the veins rise from base\r\nto apex, curving as they advance, as in the well-known lily of the\r\nvalley. This “nervous system” of the leaf is its “venation,” and the\r\nveins distributed in the blade or _lamina_ of the leaf are twofold,—as\r\nremarked,—ascending in curves, or diverging from a central nerve\r\ncalled the “mid-rib.” These lateral nerves are either parallel or\r\n“reticulate”—that is, net-like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 762.—Net-veined leaf.]\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the forms of leaves which are regulated by the\r\ndivergence and extension of the divisions of the mid-rib. Thus we get\r\nan orbicular, or _peltate_ leaf; _palmate_, _digitate_, and _pedate_\r\nforms also occur, as may be seen in the illustrations, pages 672 and\r\n673, where all the varied shapes can be studied. The leaf consists of a\r\n_petiole_ or stalk, and the _lamina_ or blade. The petiole is composed\r\nof bundles of vascular tissue; the lamina is formed by their extension,\r\nthe interstices being filled with cellular tissue. So we perceive that\r\nthe leaves and stems are composed of similar materials. To defend\r\nthe tissue a skin, or epidermis, is placed upon the surface of the\r\nleaf, and this _epidermis_ is full of breathing holes, or _pores_,\r\ncalled _stomates_ (compare page 664). There are also cells filled with\r\nchlorophyl, which gives the leaf its green tint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 763.—Linden tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 764.—Stomates, highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe _petiole_ may be absent in a leaf, and when it is the leaves are\r\ntermed _sessile_, or sitting leaves. These leaves sometimes coil round\r\nthe stem, and are called “amplexicaul,” or stalk embracers. These are\r\nsimple leaves. Compound leaves are composed of several blades or\r\nlaminæ on a stalk, and are seldom sessile. SIMPLE LEAVES are almost\r\ninnumerable in form and variety. Leaves may be _equal_ or _unequal_,\r\n_acicular_ or _linear_, _rounded_ or _oval_, _cordate_ or _obcordate_,\r\n_reniform_ or _sagittate_, _perfoliate_ or _connate_, _crisp_,\r\n_whorled_ or _truncate_, _retuse_, _acuminate_ or _mucronate_. The\r\nmargins of simple leaves again are entire, deft, notched, crenated,\r\ncrenulated, sinuous, or dentated. They are pinnatifid, multifid, or\r\nlobed, according to the divisions of the leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAVES.\r\n\r\nI. DEPENDING ON FORM.\r\n\r\n  Lanceolate (Privet).\r\n  Ovate (Fuchsia fulgens).\r\n  Oblong (Primrose).\r\n  Cordate (White Bryony).\r\n  Palmate (vine).\r\n\r\nII. DEPENDING ON MARGIN AND ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\n  Serrate (Rose).\r\n  Biserrate (Elm).\r\n  Crenate (Betony).\r\n  Entire (Lilac).\r\n  Digitate (Lupin).\r\n  Pinnate (Vetch).\r\n  Bipinnate (Acacia).\r\n  Pinnatifid (Crepis).\r\n  Ternate (Clover).\r\n  Biternate (Columbine).\r\n\r\nIII. DEPENDING ON POINT.\r\n\r\n  Obtuse (Dock).\r\n  Mucronate (Holly).\r\n  Retuce (Snowball).\r\n  Emarginate (Bladder Senna).]\r\n\r\nCompound leaves are also divided into classes. The _pinnate_, as\r\nthe rose-leaf, the clover trefoil. There are “doubly pinnate,” the\r\ndigitate, as in the horse chestnut. Compound and simple leaves can be\r\nreadily distinguished by inspection, for the former are “articulated”\r\nto the stalk and can be separated, but the simple leaves will be torn,\r\nfor they are confluent throughout.\r\n\r\nLeaves are evergreen or deciduous, accordingly as they retain or shed\r\nthemselves. The ordinary leaf is deciduous; the fir and the yew and the\r\nimported laurel are evergreens. We have very few of these as natives of\r\nEngland, the ivy, yew, and fir being the three most common. Sometimes\r\na plant peculiar to Killarney, and known as the arbutus, is included\r\nin the list. But the Scotch fir and the yew are distinctly native\r\nevergreens.\r\n\r\nThe detailed characteristics of leaves must be passed over until we\r\ncome to the fly-catching leaves—such as Venus’ fly-trap, the droseras,\r\nand nepenthes, which appear to catch and devour insects for food. The\r\nVenus’ fly-trap may be examined, and we shall find the leaves covered\r\nwith tiny and very sensitive hairs. Often a fly happens to alight\r\nupon the leaf, which is extended in a most innocent manner (_see_\r\nillustration). As soon as the fly settles the leaves close, and the\r\ndigits lock tightly together, thus preventing the escape of the prey.\r\nThe droseras, sarracenias, and nepenthes also kill their food. The\r\nsarracenias form curious cups, into which insects are enticed in search\r\nof fluid, and then, as in the case of the house-haunting cockroach,\r\nthey cannot get out again. The nepenthes have a cup and lid for\r\ninsect-catching, and within the cup a liquid is secreted.\r\n\r\nWe will close this portion of our subject with a quotation from a\r\nrecent article upon botany referring to leaf arrangement. The writer\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 765.—Leaf of Dionæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 767.—Leaf of Nepenthes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 766.—Sarracenia.]\r\n\r\n“Efforts have been made to determine the laws to which these various\r\nmodes of leaf-arrangement may be referable. The result is found in the\r\ndoctrine of ‘Phyllotaxy,’ as it is called, the fundamental principle\r\nof the whole being that Nature, in the disposition of the leaves upon\r\nthe stem, works upon precisely the same idea as that which is set forth\r\nso distinctly and elegantly in the common pine-cone; and, on a minor\r\nscale, in the beautiful cone of the female hop; not to mention the\r\nquasi-cones of many species of tropical palm, such as the Sagus and the\r\nMauritia; nor to mention either, the very delicate repetition of the\r\nwhole series in the florets of the Rudbeckia and the ripening fruits\r\nof Chaucer’s daisy. In every one of the flower and fruit arrangements\r\nmentioned, the idea is the spiral,—the same sweet old fashion which we\r\nhave had in the twining stems of the convolvulus, the woodbine, and\r\nthe scarlet bean; which comes out again in many a sea-shell, and in\r\nhuman ringlets; and this idea, according to ‘Phyllotaxy,’ governs the\r\nposition of the leaves. Following alternate leaves up the stem, their\r\nsequence is clearly spiral. Through the non-development of internodes,\r\nthey are brought closer and closer together; and even when the entire\r\nmass of foliage is concentrated and condensed into the rosulate\r\nform, as in the houseleek and the Echeverias, the spiral prototype\r\nis still distinguishable. The whole matter has been reduced to one\r\nof arithmetical exactitude; and for those who love calculations and\r\n“fractions,” the determination of the spirals, their continuity and\r\nintermixture, supplies abundance of curious entertainment. All three\r\nmodes of leaf-arrangement are found in certain herbaceous plants,\r\nnone disclosing this particular kind of playfulness more plainly than\r\nthe common pyramidal Loosestrife, _Lysimachia vulgaris_, and the\r\npurple Lythrum of the waterside, in each of which very handsome wild\r\nflowers, alternate, opposite, and whorled leaves may be found in near\r\nneighbourhood. Alternate and opposite leaves are also met with, side\r\nby side, in various species of Myrtaceæ; and imperfectly, upon young\r\nshoots of the common ash-tree. The rule is, nevertheless, that there\r\nshall be uniformity, and in many of the largest natural orders the\r\nrule is never broken. In the Rosaceæ the stem leaves are invariably\r\nalternate; in the Gentianaceæ they are invariably opposite.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 768.—Branch of horse chestnut.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Dr. Carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nFLOWERING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n ORGANS OF INCREASE AND REPRODUCTION—THE FLOWER—THE CALYX—THE\r\n COROLLA—THE STAMEN—THE PISTIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the simplest plants are propagated by _spores_, which are\r\ndetached, and fall upon the ground to vegetate; but in the case of the\r\nhigher orders the reproduction of species is a much more elaborate\r\nprocess, and is carried on by means of certain organs called flowers.\r\nSmall buds, or _ovules_, are formed, which develop into seed. Plants\r\nalso produce buds, which grow upon various parts of it, and are capable\r\nof reproducing their species. We will first speak of FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nFlowers are not only the lovely blossoms we cut and place in our rooms,\r\nbut the reproductive organs of plants which may be very plain and\r\nsimple or gorgeous and fragrant, and in all probability the so-called\r\nflowers are few in comparison to the unrecognized flowers. Trees\r\nand bushes flower equally with the rose and the pink and carnation.\r\nVegetables flower as well as the lily, though we do not recognize it so\r\nwell. Let us now examine the “flower.”\r\n\r\nFlowers may consist of four parts, but it is not absolutely necessary\r\nthat they should contain more than two. The four portions of a complete\r\nflower are—\r\n\r\n  1. THE CALYX.\r\n  2. THE COROLLA.\r\n  3. THE STAMEN.\r\n  4. THE PISTIL.\r\n\r\nThe two last mentioned are essential. The four organs are placed around\r\na pedicel or peduncle (flower stalk), and are known as floral whorls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CALYX is the outermost whorl of all when all exist. The portions of\r\nthe calyx are known as _sepals_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COROLLA is usually the showy portion—the attraction of the flower.\r\nThe pieces of the corolla are called _petals_. The sweet fluids of the\r\nplant are here concealed.\r\n\r\nThese parts—the calyx and corolla—are known as the floral envelopes,\r\nor “perianth.” The tulip has one whorl only, and it is called the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nThe calyx sometimes falls before the flower is full blown, as in the\r\npoppy. Its lower portion is the “throat,” and the shape of the organ\r\nvaries, as will be seen by the illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 769.—\r\n\r\n  1. Tubular.\r\n  2. Clavate, or club-shaped.\r\n  3. Tubinate, or top-shaped.\r\n  4. Campanulate, or bell-shaped.\r\n  5. Funnel-shaped.\r\n  6. Urceolate, or urn-shaped.\r\n  7. Globular.]\r\n\r\nThe sepals are usually three to five in number. The poppy has two, and\r\nthe well-known wall-flower four free—that is, disunited—sepals. The\r\nprimrose possesses five. The calyx is the outside rim of all, and we\r\nmay thus remember it, because its _sepals_ alternate with the _petals_\r\nof the _corolla_. The petals may be formed cup-fashion, as in the lily\r\nof the valley, and here we have these sepals and petals in groups of\r\nthree each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 770.—Trimerous corolla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 771.—Tetramerous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 772.—Pentamerous corolla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 773.—Monopetalous corolla.]\r\n\r\nThe petals differ from ordinary leaves, and in them we find all the\r\nbeautiful tints and the odour we imbibe from blossoms. The forms of\r\ncorolla correspond to those of the calyx, and are called by the same\r\nnames. But when corollas are absent the petals of course cannot provide\r\nthe necessary colours for the flower. Then the calyx is gifted, and the\r\nsepals are brilliant. Thus Nature provides for everything.\r\n\r\nCorollas are found with five or ten petals, and sometimes with three,\r\nsix, and nine—the numbers always doubling or adding the original\r\nnumber. There may be four petals or eight, as in the “tetramerous”\r\ncorolla (fig. 771). Instances of others are illustrated, and a plant\r\nwhose petals, sepals, and stamens are numerically equal, or are\r\nmultiples of each other, are termed “symmetrical.” The “regular” flower\r\ndoes not vary much, as the petals are of the same size and shape,\r\nbut there are many “irregular” flowers—as the pea—in which portions\r\nof the calyx or corolla are of different shapes. The “labiate” and\r\nthe “campanulate” are illustrated in figs. 774, 775, including the\r\nconvolvulus and the snap-dragon. These are but a few examples of\r\nan almost endless diversity. The “regular” flowers—exemplified in\r\nthe buttercup and convolvulus—always present the same figure to the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nTo the petals the beautifully-varied colours of plants are due, and\r\nthough it is not possible to enter upon the subject here, we may\r\nconclude that the various beauties of the colours of flowers are owing\r\nto light and air acting upon the various “colouring matters” contained\r\nin the plant. Seeds planted in a dark cellar will spring up pale;\r\nadmit light, and they will become green, for light thus acts upon the\r\nchlorophyl. But the flowers of the plant are not so dependent upon\r\nlight, as can easily be proved. Many interesting experiments have been\r\nmade upon flowers by acids and gases.[36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 774.—Labiate corolla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 775.—Campanulate.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe STAMENS are the next in order for our consideration. They are found\r\nwithin the petals (or the calyx if no petals be present). Stamens vary\r\nvery much in different plants both in number and general features—but,\r\nas in the case of petals, they keep, as a rule, to certain numbers\r\nand doubles of them. The stamen consists of two portions—a lower,\r\nthread-like part called the filament, and an oblong bag or head, termed\r\nthe _anther_. This contains a powdery matter called pollen, and is the\r\nessential part of the stamen. The filament, which corresponds to the\r\npetiole of the leaf, may be absent, in which case the anther is called\r\n_sessile_. A lily will show the stamens perfectly, the anther being\r\nprominent in many other plants also, such as daffodils and fuchsias.\r\n\r\nThe stamens are very important organs with regard to the classification\r\nof plants—for number, length, and position, whether free or united, are\r\nall characteristic features. The length of filaments is always the same\r\nin the same kind of plant, and therefore is a very palpable test.\r\n\r\nThe _anther_ contains the _pollen_, a powdery matter, usually\r\nyellow-coloured, but sometimes also red, brown, violet, or\r\ngreen-coloured. Pollen-grains vary from 1/20 to 1/300 of a line in\r\ndiameter. Under a powerful microscope they appear as ellipsoidal, or\r\nsometimes spherical, triangular, polyhedral vesicles, filled with a\r\ngranular semi-fluid matter. To effect fecundation, the pollen-grains\r\nmust come into contact with a certain part of the plant which is\r\nintended to receive them, and which is called the _ovule_, and is found\r\nin the fourth or innermost verticil of the flower, the _pistil_. Of the\r\nfurther development of the ovule, we shall have occasion to speak in\r\nthe paragraph treating of the _seed_.\r\n\r\nAt the proper time the anther opens and discharges its contents, the\r\npollen-grains, some of which reach the place of their destination. The\r\nposition of the stamens to the pistil is usually such that the latter\r\ncan readily receive the pollen-grains. In many plants, however, the\r\nstamens are too short to reach the pistils; or the two essential organs\r\nof reproduction are in separate flowers, or even on different plants.\r\nIn such cases, the conveyance of the pollen from the anthers to the\r\npistils is effected by the agency of the wind, or by that of insects,\r\nand more particularly by the bee. If the anthers are removed from the\r\nflower previously to their opening, no fruit is produced.\r\n\r\nVarieties of flowers and fruits are produced artificially, by shaking\r\nthe pollen of one plant upon the flowers of another, deprived of the\r\nstamens. Many esteemed sorts of stock-gilliflowers and pinks have been\r\nproduced in this way.\r\n\r\nThe pistil constitutes the fourth and innermost whorl, and occupies\r\naccordingly the centre of the flower and the apex of the axis, whose\r\ngrowth is terminated with the production of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 776.—Pistil.]\r\n\r\nThe pistil also is formed by one or several modified leaves, called\r\n_carpels_, in this part of the flower, and which exhibit a more marked\r\nresemblance in colour and structure to the ordinary leaves than the\r\nstamens and petals do. The formation of the pistil from the leaf may be\r\nconsidered to proceed in this manner: that the edges of the leaf are\r\nfolded inwards and unite, whilst the mid-rib is prolonged upwards (fig.\r\n776A). The place where the margins of the folded leaves are united is\r\ncalled _suture_ or _seam_ (_ventral suture_, in contradistinction to\r\nthe mid-rib, which is called the _dorsal suture_); and it is here that\r\nthe seed-buds or _ovules_ are developed.\r\n\r\nThe pistil consists of two parts—viz., the _ovary_ or _germen_, which\r\ncontains the ovules or young seeds, _a_, and the _stigma_, _b_, either\r\nplaced upon the ovary, or upon the _style_, or stalk, which is between\r\nthe stigma and the ovary.\r\n\r\nA _pistil_ may be of one _carpel_ (simple), or of more than one\r\n(compound). The carpels or the carpellary leaves are the “ovaries.”\r\n\r\nThe pistil is a very important test for the classification of plants;\r\nsome trees have no pistils, and the ovules are consequently naked. Such\r\nplants are called _gymnospermæ_. The coniferæ (firs and pines) are thus\r\nrecognizable, and the position of the ovule is very much that of the\r\nordinary bud.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Respecting artificial colouring of flowers, _see_ page 329.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nFLOWERING PLANTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n THE FLORAL AXIS—INFLORESCENCE—FRUIT—SEED—NUTRITION OF PLANTS—ABSORPTION\r\n OF CONSTITUENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain arrangements and mutual relations of the various\r\nportions of the flowers which we have mentioned that it is useful\r\nto consider. The _floral axis_ refers to the position of the\r\nverticils, and _inflorescence_ signifies the arrangement of the\r\nflowers on the stem. Flowers which possess both stamens and pistil\r\nare _hermaphrodite_; those with only stamens are male; those with the\r\npistil female flowers. If both organs be absent the flower is neutral.\r\n\r\nPlants bearing flowers in clusters form several distinct groups, to\r\nwhich appropriate terms are applied indicative of their respective form\r\nof flora arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 777.—(1) Spike. (2) Catkin. (3) Spadix. (4) Cone.]\r\n\r\nIn the examination of this kind of inflorescence (_indefinite_ or\r\n_axillary inflorescence_), the first object of remark is the general\r\nor primary peduncle, termed _rachis_, and which bears numerous\r\nleaflets called _bracteoles_ or _bractlets_, from whose axils arise the\r\n_pedicellate_ or _sessile_ flowers. The lower bracts often produce no\r\nflower-buds in their axils, and form instead a whorl surrounding the\r\nheads of flowers on the primary axis, and which is called _involucre_\r\n(as in the sun-flower, for instance).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 778.—Raceme.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 779.—Panicle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 780.—Corymb.]\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of axillary inflorescence are determined\r\nprincipally by the elongation or depression of the axis, the presence\r\nor absence of stalks to the flowers, and the form and nature of the\r\nbracts. We distinguish—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 781.—Umbel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 782.—Capitulum or ball.]\r\n\r\n1. (1) The _spike_ (fig. 777). In this form of inflorescence, sessile\r\nor short-stalked flowers are arranged along the rachis in the axils\r\nof the bracts; the spike is said to be _compound_ when small spikes\r\nor _spikelets_ arise again from the bracts of the secondary axis. (2)\r\nThe _catkin_ or _amentum_ (fig. 777 [2]); a spike, usually pendulous,\r\nwhich falls off, rachis and all, by an articulation, as in the willow\r\nor hazel. 3. The _spadix_, a thick fleshy spike (fig. 777 [3]);\r\nexamples, _arum_ and _calamus_. 4. The _cone_, a fruit-bearing spike,\r\ncovered with scales (fig. 777 [4]); examples, the _coniferæ_. 5. The\r\n_raceme_ or _cluster_, a spike with the flowers on longer pedicels\r\n(fig. 778); examples, the _currant_. 6. The _panicle_, a branching\r\nraceme (fig. 779, _Yucca gloriosa_). 7. The _thyrsus_, a dense panicle,\r\nwith longer peduncles in the middle than at the extremities; example,\r\n_lilac_. 8. The _corymb_, a raceme, in which the lower flower stalks\r\nare elongated and raised to nearly a level with the upper (fig.\r\n780)—example, _cerasus mahaleb_. 9. The _compound_ or _branching\r\ncorymb_, a corymb in which the secondary axis again sub-divides;\r\nexample, _Pyrus terminalis_. 10. The _umbel_: in this form the primary\r\naxis is greatly depressed, and the peduncles arise from a common point,\r\nand spread out like radii of nearly equal length, a whorl of bracts\r\n(_involucre_) surrounding the common base. In the _compound umbel_\r\n(fig. 781), _Daucus carota_, the secondary axis ends in small umbels\r\nsurrounded by bracts, which is termed an involucel. This is observable\r\nin the umbelliferous plants—carrot, parsley, hemlock, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 783.—Inflorescence.]\r\n\r\nA very peculiar kind of inflorescence, which characterises the great\r\nfamily of the _compositæ_, is illustrated by fig. 783. We see here the\r\nenlarged floral axis or receptacle, _a_, surrounded by several whorls\r\nor bracts, _b b_, which constitute a general involucre; the membranous\r\nbracts, (_paleæ_), _b´ b´_, seen in the receptacle, bear in their axils\r\nthe sessile florets, _c_ and _d_, which either have a calyx, _e e_, or\r\nnot. The florets on the receptacle are either all of them _tubular_\r\n(_d_) or _ligulate_ (tongue or strap-shaped); florets (_c_) are\r\nassociated with the tubular ones. The receptacle is not always flat,\r\nbut frequently presents a convex, globular, conical, concave, etc.,\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of _paleæ_ the receptacle is said to be naked. The\r\nflorets at the margin, or circumference, are termed _marginal flowers_,\r\nor _flowers of the ray_; the florets in the disc (_centre_), _central\r\nflowers_, or _flowers of the disc_.\r\n\r\nSome plants bear male and female flowers on the same stem. These are\r\ntermed _monæcious_ plants. The oak is an instance. The diæcious plants\r\nare those which bear stamens and pistil, or separately, on different\r\nplants, like willows. We will now glance at the functions of the\r\nstamens and pistil. The ovule has been mentioned as a tiny body in the\r\novary, and it consists of a nucleus, and cellular tissue surround it,\r\nleaving a small hole called the _micropyle_, into which the pollen tube\r\nenters after passing through the ovary. As in the animal creation, the\r\nunions of different families succeed best; no close relationship will\r\nfertilize so well as with other flowers.\r\n\r\nFertilization is accomplished in two ways; (1) by the action of the\r\nwind, by which the pollen is carried away to other plants; and (2) by\r\nmeans of insects—the bee particularly. These flowers have distinctive\r\nqualities relatively. In the case of the pine the pollen is powdery; so\r\nthose plants which are thus fertilized are the diæcious species, which\r\ninclude the poplar, the oak, and the birch, as well as the pines. These\r\nare all wind-carried pollen plants. The nettle is illustrated here with\r\nmale and female flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 784.—Male flower of nettle.]\r\n\r\nPlants fertilized by insects are visited by them, and they carry away\r\nupon their heads, or bodies, the pollen, which is then thrust into the\r\nstigma by the insect; or perhaps birds may carry the pollen in the same\r\nway after sipping the nectar, and thus playing an unconscious, but most\r\nimportant, part in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 785.—Female flower of nettle.]\r\n\r\nWe always find the _ovule_ at the termination of an axis; it is unable\r\nto form a seed alone. The pollen grains must fertilize it, and in\r\nconsequence many ovules come to nought. The ovule is produced in the\r\npistil, which, as before stated consists essentially of two parts—the\r\n_ovary_ and the _stigma_; the latter secretes a fluid to hold the\r\npollen. We annex the representation of a highly-magnified pistil\r\n(vertical section, fig. 786_a_). The pollen grains are indicated by\r\n_d_, attached to stigma, _c_, projecting through the style, _b_, into\r\nthe ovary, _a_, and passing through the ovules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 786.—Erect ovule.]\r\n\r\nWith the transmission of the pollen to the ovary of the pistil, the\r\nfunctions of the anther and stigma terminate; accordingly these parts\r\nof the flower rapidly wither and decay after fertilization. The\r\nfilaments, the style, and the petals speedily participate in the decay,\r\nbut the sepals remain sometimes persistent in an altered form. The\r\novary and its contents alone proceed in their further development, and\r\nundergo material changes, in which, however, the bracts and the calyx\r\noften participate.\r\n\r\nThe fully developed and matured ovule, the _seed_, is, of course,\r\nregarded as the _essential_ part of the fruit; the enlarged ovary\r\nforms the _pericarp_, enclosing the seed. The form of the pericarp\r\ndetermines the external appearance of the denomination of the fruit.\r\nThe structure of the fruit, and the arrangement of its parts depends in\r\na great measure upon the number and position of the carpellary leaves\r\nin the pistil, and the manner and extent of their union, and the extent\r\nto which their edges are folded inwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 787.—Dorstenia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 788.—Dandelion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 789.—Apple.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 790.—Follicles of larkspur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 791.—Sycamore fig.]\r\n\r\nThe carpellary leaves occupy the summit of the floral axis. The axis\r\nterminates either in one single carpel, in which case the ovary is\r\none-celled, or _unilocular_; or the axis is surrounded by several\r\ncarpels, in which case the manner of their union determines the number\r\nof cells in the ovary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUIT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 792.—Sycamore fig.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 793.—Fruit of a composite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 794.—Section of a berry.]\r\n\r\nThe carpels are the chief agents in the formation of the fruit, and\r\nthey form the endocarp (core), and sometimes the whole pericarp, or\r\nseed-vessel. Upon the nature of the various parts and the changes they\r\nundergo during the ripening of the seeds the nature of the fruit\r\ndepends. The fruits are classified, some being the produce of a single\r\ncarpel, others of several united carpels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 795.—Umbelliferous plant and its fruit.]\r\n\r\nFruit, in botany, is by no means limited to the juicy products of\r\ntrees or plants which are so refreshing in the summer weather, and so\r\nacceptable in any form. In plant life the herb yielding seed produces\r\na fruit equally with the orange or the apple. The fruit is the outcome\r\nof the varied processes of the plant. We may trace the plant from\r\nits tiny, sometimes very minute seed, through stem to flower and\r\nseed again. “In the final struggle, even when life is hopeless, and\r\nstarvation, in consequence of drought, is imminent—when all is hopeless\r\nand barren, the plant will make an effort to produce its fruit and\r\nflower.” This is a very touching and interesting fact in nature—this\r\nlast attempt to beautify the earth and to propagate its species for the\r\nuse of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 796.—Three-celled capsule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 797.—Poppy.]\r\n\r\nFruit, then, is not limited to the market and the stall.\r\n\r\nThis statement scarcely needs proof; but if we consider for a\r\nmoment the number of “wild” fruits—the parents, probably, of our\r\ntable-fruits—we find many we cannot eat. In short, out of the hundred\r\nthousand plants which bear flowers scarce one two-hundredth part serve\r\nus as producers of edible fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 798.—Three-celled capsule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 799.—Water melon.]\r\n\r\nThe fruit is the result of the flower, and if any objection be made\r\nby readers on the part of the common fig, it will be found that this\r\nappreciated fruit really consists of male and female flowers that are\r\nfertilized by the action of minute insects, which enter and depart\r\n(sometimes they die, and are found dead and black in the figs). No\r\nblossom is perceived on the tree, because within the green sac the\r\nso-called “seeds” (really the fruits) are developing. A fig is a sac\r\nfull of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe _legume_ or pod is formed of a single carpel bearing seeds. We\r\nannex illustrations of the pod. The covering is called the _pericarp_,\r\nand the parts when opened separate into valves. Dehiscent fruits\r\nshed their seeds, indehiscent fruits do not; they lie within the\r\nseed-vessel, like the acorns and nuts. These are dry fruits, but there\r\nare others of a soft nature, such as apples or gooseberries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 800.—Legume.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 801.—Legume opened.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 802.—Legume (pea).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 803.—Gland (acorn).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 804.—Stobule (hop).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 805.—Drupe (plum).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 806.—Berry (currant).]\r\n\r\nFruits are variously named, and underneath will be found a list. We\r\nhave the aggregate, like the mulberry, etc.; the dehiscent fruit of\r\none carpel like the pea, etc.; the simple fruits as cherry, nettle,\r\nwheat, etc. The dandelion fruit is often a precious object in\r\nchildren’s estimation, as it is blown away to ascertain the time. There\r\nare indehiscent fruits with many carpels,—the common buttercup, for\r\ninstance, and the strawberry. A list is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ FRUITS WHICH ARE THE PRODUCE OF A SOLITARY CARPEL.\r\n\r\n1. The _gymnospermous_ fruit, where the seed lies naked in the axils of\r\nthe ligneous bracts, as in the cone of the fir and spruce tribe.\r\n\r\n2. The _legume_ or pod, which is formed of a solitary carpel bearing\r\nseeds on the ventral suture. It characterises the pea and bean tribe\r\n(_leguminosæ_).\r\n\r\n3. The _follicle_ is a mature carpel containing several seeds, and\r\nopening by the ventral suture. There are usually several follicles\r\naggregated together; examples, larkspur, monkshood, evergreen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ FRUITS WHICH ARE THE PRODUCE OF SEVERAL CARPELS UNITED.\r\n\r\n4. The _capsule_ consists of two or more carpels, either simply\r\nlaterally united (one-celled or unilocular capsule), or folded inwards\r\ntowards the axis, but without reaching it (spuriously multilocular\r\ncapsule), or uniting with the axis (bilocular, trilocular, multilocular\r\ncapsule). Examples of capsular fruit—mignonette, balsam, violet, poppy,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n5. The _siliqua_ or long pod is formed of two carpels, and\r\nlongitudinally divided into two parts by a spurious dissepiment called\r\nthe _replum_; examples—cabbages, stock, wallflower, etc. The _silicula_\r\nis a broad and short pod; examples—Iberis, shepherd’s-purse, etc.\r\n\r\n6. The _cariopse_ (_caryopsis_, having the appearance of a nut), is\r\na monospermous or one-seeded fruit, with an indehiscent membranous\r\npericarp, closely investing the seed or incorporated with it;\r\nexamples—rye, wheat, and other grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 807.—Capsule (poppy).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 808.—Siliqua (shepherd’s purse, wallflower).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 809.—Caryopsis (wheat).]\r\n\r\n7. The _achænium_ is a dry, monospermous, indehiscent fruit with one\r\nseed; examples—cashew, ranunculus, strawberry, etc.\r\n\r\n8. The _nut_ or glans is a one-celled, indehiscent fruit, with\r\na hardened coriaceous or ligneous pericarp; examples—hazel-nut,\r\nacorn, etc. The _nucula_, or little nut, is a cariopse, with a solid\r\ncoriaceous pericarp; examples—buckwheat hemp, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 810.—Nut (hazel-nut).]\r\n\r\n9. The _berry_ (_bacca_) is a pulpy, succulent fruit, with soft rind;\r\nexamples—the gooseberry and the currant. The _pepo_ or peponida\r\n(pumpkin), illustrated by the fruit of the gourd and melon, and the\r\n_hesperidium_, illustrated by the fruit of the orange and lemon, are\r\nmodifications of the berry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 811.—Strawberry.]\r\n\r\n10. The _drupe_ (_drupæ_, unripe olives); the mesocarp is generally\r\npulpy and succulent, the endocarp hard; examples—the cherry, the peach,\r\nthe plum, etc.\r\n\r\n11. The _pome_ (_pomum_, or apple); the outer parts of the pericarp\r\nform a thick cellular, eatable mass; the endocarp (core) is scaly or\r\nhorny, and encloses the seeds within separate cells; examples—the\r\napple, pear, etc.\r\n\r\nFruits consisting of the floral envelopes and the ovaries of several\r\nflowers united into one, are termed multiple or anthocarpous; the\r\n_sorosis_ (cluster-fruit: example—the pine-apple, the breadfruit, the\r\nmulberry), the _sycosis_ (fig-fruit), and the _strobilus_ (fir-cone),\r\nform varieties of the anthocarpous or multiple fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-FLOWERING PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe cryptogamia or acrogens is the botanical term for these plants, of\r\nwhich we must be very brief in our description,—not that the subject\r\nis not worthy of a much larger space than we can devote to it, but our\r\npages are not elastic.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of plants without pistils or stamens properly so\r\ncalled. They are hidden from human observation—buried out of sight;\r\nand in the fern, moss, and other primitive plants they are thus\r\nhidden. There are several families of the cryptogamia, but two main\r\nsections include them all—viz., the cormogens and thallogens. These are\r\nsometimes known as cormophytes and thallophytes, but the former will\r\nbe our terms, and they include the ferns, algæ, lichens, and mosses,\r\nwith many other families, which we do not propose to examine in this\r\nsummary sketch. The microscope will here be a great aid if not always\r\nabsolutely necessary for any close investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 812.—Liverwort.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 813.—Hypnum.]\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the appearance of ferns, and we may commence\r\nwith a few observations concerning them. They are an extensive family\r\nand very beautiful, some of the tropical species being particularly\r\nnoticeable for elegance. We are here mostly concerned with the\r\ndevelopment of the plant. The polypod ferns fructify under the leaves\r\nor “fronds,” which open from a ball. The seed-cases or _sorri_ are\r\nsituated at the back of the fronds in brown spots, and when examined\r\nthey will be found to be collections of capsules like tiny cases.\r\nThere is a kind of band at the upper part which at the proper time is\r\nextended, and tearing open the capsule releases the seeds. These seeds\r\nor “spores” are very minute, and not properly seeds but buds, every one\r\nof which can generate seeds. So if we try to grasp in imagination the\r\ngenerating powers of a few fern fronds, we shall miserably fail in the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 814.—Horsetail.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 815.—Bryum.]\r\n\r\nSome ferns have the “spores” upon the summit of the frond. The osmundas\r\nbelong to this family, and are known to all as the “flowering fern,” a\r\ncontradiction palpable enough under the circumstances. The beautiful\r\ndust upon some ferns has been mistaken for “spores” by many people,\r\nbut it is merely a natural ornament of the plant. The venation and\r\nvernation of ferns are very curious, but in the determination of ferns\r\nthe only sure way is to consider the _sorri_ and the venation. The\r\ndifferences that puzzle may be little or great, but when the sorri have\r\nbeen examined all doubts will be set aside.\r\n\r\nThere are about three thousand varieties of ferns known, and we give\r\na few illustrations of them, although any detailed description is out\r\nof the question, for we have to mention the beautiful mosses of which\r\nthere are in Britain more than five hundred different species, all\r\nextremely beautiful, perfectly innocuous, and even beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOSSES AND ALGÆ.\r\n\r\nThese plants are extremely lowly in the score of creation, and also in\r\nstature. Very few mosses attain any elevation, only the “sporangia”\r\nshoot up, and the plants are very delicately formed, the leaves being\r\nall of the same pattern. They are common in damp situations, and thrive\r\nin woods, streams, and banks. The _Fontinalis_ is a river moss, while\r\nthe _Hypnum_ is found in hedges. The Lycopodiaceæ or the club-moss\r\nfamily is intermediate between ferns and mosses. They are found in\r\nwarm, moist climates, and contain a sort of brimstone. They grow well\r\nwith ferns under glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 816.—Diatoma vulgaris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 817.—Club-moss.]\r\n\r\nThe _Musci_ or moss-family proper are useful in various ways. We have\r\nalso the _liverworts_, which bear some resemblance to lichens. They\r\ngrow between stones near water, or in damp situations. There are\r\ntwo distinct families, both beautiful when examined, and are named\r\nMarchantiaceæ, and Jungeramanniaceæ, or scale moss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 818.—Scale-moss.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 819.—Various diatomaceæ.]\r\n\r\nThe _Thallogens_ or Thallogenæ include algæ, lichens, and fungi,\r\nwhich are the lowest of the plants, and all very much alike. The algæ\r\nare termed “protophytes,” and consist of living cells propagating by\r\nsubdivision, or union. The thallogens have therefore no distinct axes,\r\nleaves, or stomata.\r\n\r\nThe algæ are thus simply cellular plants found in salt or fresh water,\r\nhot and cold. They sometimes appear as “slime.” Some contain silicia,\r\nand are termed _Diatomaceæ_, and these propagate by subdivision,\r\nand when they die their shelly covering remains, and we find the\r\nshells or cases in all earthy formations. These diatomaceæ have been\r\nraised from the beds of oceans, and Atlantic soundings have revealed\r\ntheir presence,—as mud, when examined, proves to be these remains\r\nof vegetable shells. Thus the infinitely little in the animal and\r\nvegetable worlds meet at the bottom of the sea, as well as on dry land.\r\n\r\nThere are marine and fresh-water algæ—the former familiar to us as\r\nseaweeds which possess air-bladders that children love to explode,\r\nand which assist the algæ to float. They attach themselves to rocks,\r\ngenerally at the base; the lovely colours of seaweeds are well known.\r\nThey will be recognized under the name of “tangle” (fucus), which, when\r\nburned, gives kelp and barilla, which is full of iodide and sodium.\r\nThe Sargasso Sea is composed of miles of algæ which live in the open\r\nocean. The _Carrageen_ or Irish moss is very nutritious and useful in\r\nconsumptive cases. Indeed, all algæ, if not absolutely useful, are\r\ncertainly not deleterious. The “bladder-wrack” was formerly useful for\r\nthe production of soda.\r\n\r\n“The life-history of one of these uni-cellular plants in its most\r\nsimple form, can scarcely be better exemplified than in the _Palmogeœa\r\nmacrococca_, one of those humble forms of vegetation which spreads\r\nitself as a green slime over damp stones, walls, etc. When this slime\r\nis examined with a microscope, it is found to consist of a multitude\r\nof green cells, each surrounded by a gelatinous envelope; the cell\r\nwhich does not seem to have any distinct membranous wall is filled with\r\ngranular particles of a green colour, and a ‘nucleus’ may sometimes be\r\ndistinguished through the midst of these. When treated with tincture\r\nof iodine, however, the green contents of the cell are turned to a\r\nbrownish hue, and a dark-brown nucleus is distinctly shown. Other cells\r\nare seen, which are considerably elongated, some of them beginning to\r\npresent a sort of hour-glass contraction across the middle; in these\r\nis commencing that curious _multiplication by duplicative subdivision_\r\nwhich is the mode in which increase nearly always takes place\r\nthroughout the vegetable kingdom.”[37]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 820.—Bladder wrack.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 821.—Lichen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHENS are numerous, and may be found upon the bark of trees in dry\r\nforms of grey and yellow growth, and on walls and old stones in our\r\ngraveyards. On the hills we find them growing upon the granite, and it\r\nwould appear that they prefer stone to any other holding ground. The\r\nArctic lichens form the principal food of the useful reindeer, and\r\n“Iceland moss” is represented as wholesome for man. Lichen is derived\r\nfrom the Greek term for “wart.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FUNGI are very important, and with them we will close our summary.\r\nThey include the favourite mushrooms and poisonous toad-stools, with\r\nmany other “fungous growths,” from the “mould” on the jam pot to the\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\nSome of these fungi are peculiar to the substances upon which they\r\nexist, and are in numerous instances destructive. The microscopic\r\nfungus _Puccinea graminis_ is the parasite which fixes itself to corn,\r\nand produces the disease known as mildew, and the _Uredo segetum_\r\n(another microscopic fungus) causes the “smut”; the “bunt” is caused\r\nby the _Uredo fœtida_, and the “spur” or “ergot,” which attacks rye,\r\nis caused by the _Acinula clavis_. These fungi completely destroy the\r\ngrain of corn in which they form, and propagate in the most rapid\r\nmanner; the ergot is moreover a dangerous poison to those who eat the\r\nbread made of rye infected by it. The truffle is a kind of underground\r\nfungus, and is esteemed a dainty. Mushrooms are also fungi, and several\r\nspecies are sufficiently wholesome; these are the field mushroom and\r\nthe fairy-ring mushroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 822.—_a_ _a_, Mould from an old bone; _b_, Mould\r\nfrom jam.]\r\n\r\nAny organic substance will shortly become covered with this “mould” or\r\nmildew. The air is so full of the germs of animal and vegetable life\r\nthat, as it penetrates everywhere, the smallest supply must contain\r\nsome germs; and these, under a powerful microscope, present most\r\nbeautiful forms and colours. We annex (fig. 822) some of these forms\r\nhighly magnified. They are deposited by the air, and the substance\r\ninto which they happen to fall determines the kind of life which is to\r\ninhabit it. A few of these spores only come to maturity.\r\n\r\nWe again take the liberty to quote Dr. Carpenter on this subject. He\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n“There are scarcely any microscopic objects more beautiful than some\r\nof those forms of mould or mildew which are so commonly found growing\r\nupon the surface of jams and preserves, especially when they are viewed\r\nwith a low magnifying power and by reflected light; for they present\r\nthemselves as a forest of stems and branches of extremely varied and\r\nelegant forms, loaded with fruit of singular delicacy of conformation,\r\nall glistening brightly on a dark ground.\r\n\r\n“The universality of the appearance of these simple forms of fungi\r\nupon all spots favourable to their development, has given rise to the\r\nbelief that they are spontaneously produced by decaying substances,\r\nbut there is no occasion for this mode of accounting for it, since the\r\nextraordinary means adopted by nature for the production and diffusion\r\nof the germs of these plants adequately suffices to explain the facts\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n“The number of sporules which any one fungus may develop is almost\r\nincalculable; a single individual of the “puff-ball” tribe has been\r\ncomputed to send forth no fewer than ten millions. And their minuteness\r\nis such that they are scattered through the air in the finest possible\r\ndust, so that it is difficult to conceive of a place from which they\r\nshould be excluded.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 823.—Eatable mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 824.—Seeds with pappi.]\r\n\r\nPure water exposed to the air does not afford nourishment to the germs\r\nwhich fall into it, till a sufficient number of them shall have been\r\ndeposited to form a food for those which come after them; but if we\r\nmix with the water any soluble vegetable or animal matter, in a short\r\ntime the microscope will detect the growth of the germs that are being\r\ndeposited, for where nourishment is, there only can they be developed.\r\nThese germs are capable of existing for an indefinite period, either\r\nfloating in the water, or blown about by the air, and have been\r\ndetected hundreds of miles from land; the rigging and sails of ships\r\nfar away from shore are often covered with what sailors suppose to be\r\nsand blown from the land, but which are organic substances, either\r\nvegetable or animal. According to Humboldt, the Red Sea has derived its\r\nname from the fact that at certain seasons the surface of the water has\r\na reddish appearance, and this (as he says) he was fortunate enough\r\nto observe, which colour he found to be due to myriads of red fungi,\r\nwhich had formed on the surface. The seeds of some plants are furnished\r\nwith minute wings or plumes, which cause them to be borne on the air or\r\nfloated on the water (fig. 824), to fertilise some barren spot, perhaps\r\na coral reef, which has at length reached the surface of the water,\r\nand which ascends no higher, for the little creatures which built it\r\nare aquatic, and cannot live exposed to the air; this coral reef now\r\nbecomes a receptacle for seaweed and fungi, which float on the surface\r\nof the ocean are washed on to the reef, die, decay, and leave behind\r\na thin layer of mould, which process being repeated again and again,\r\nforms an elevated edge to the reef, enclosing a lake, or “lagoon” as it\r\nis called, the waters of which evaporate, and the space is filled up\r\nin the same way as the edge was formed, together with the excrements\r\nof birds, etc., forming layer after layer of mould, and the surface\r\nbecomes fit for the growth of larger seeds, as the cocoa-nut, banana,\r\netc., which are drifted on to it by the waves; in this way a coral reef\r\nbecomes an island fit to be inhabited by man and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for any person not accustomed to observe the manner\r\nof the propagation of the fungi, to understand a written description,\r\nfor the fructification of these plants are very varied in the manner of\r\nthe development of the spores. They are not generally hurtful, but much\r\ncaution should be observed in the matter of the mushroom, which may\r\nbe distinguished by the pale pink and black of the under part. There\r\nare many poisonous fungi, but the greater number are harmless, though\r\nthey are not intended for food. They simply clear away the decaying\r\ngrowths, and act as safety-valves to Nature by carrying away what is\r\nnot required, to give it to the air again to be renewed into life.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom forms the link between the minerals and the\r\nanimals. The vegetable derives food and nourishment from water,\r\ncarbonic acid, and ammonia, which are, as we already know, made up\r\nof certain elements, and thus supply us all with food. They give out\r\noxygen for the use of animals, and are thus, in another sense, the\r\nsource of life. The growth of a plant is very interesting, and we may\r\nconclude by following it.\r\n\r\nThe seed is sown, and the cells of the “cellular tissue” become\r\ndeveloped, passing some upwards, some downwards, to form a radicle\r\nor plumule, as explained. The latter carries up the cotyledon, which\r\nbegins to decompose carbonic acid from the atmosphere, and fixing the\r\ncarbon as woody fibre. The leaves are then formed and more fibres, and\r\nso on for every leaf; thus the number of woody fibres which form the\r\ntrunk of a tree is in proportion to the number of leaves which that\r\ntree has borne, from which we come to the conclusion that the size of\r\nthe trunk of a tree is the sum of all its branches. While all this is\r\ngoing on, the cellular tissue of the downward part or radicle also\r\nbecomes developed and divides out into roots, on the surface and at the\r\nextremities of which are minute cellular bodies called “spongioles”\r\n(from their power of absorbing moisture), which take up the fluid of\r\nthe earth which surrounds them; this moisture ascends through the\r\nvessels of the plant till it arrives at the surface of the leaves,\r\nwhere it is exposed to the action of light and sunshine. The ascent of\r\nthe moisture of the earth was first correctly explained by Du Trochet,\r\nand is owing to a peculiar power which he discovered, and which is\r\ncalled “Endosmose”; this consists in the tendency which a fluid has to\r\npenetrate a membrane on the other side of which is a fluid of greater\r\ndensity than itself. This may be seen by the following experiment:\r\nobtain a piece of glass tubing about a foot long, having the end blown\r\nout into the form of a bell, as in fig. 825, tie a piece of bladder\r\nover the expanded end and fill it partly with syrup or gum-water, so\r\nthat this shall rise in the stalk about an inch; place this in a glass\r\nof water with the bladder downwards, and the fluid will be seen slowly\r\nto rise in the stalk, so that in perhaps an hour it will rise to the\r\ntop. This apparatus resembles one of the spongioles at the extremity of\r\nthe fibre of a root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 825.—Endosmose.]\r\n\r\nThe rain falling through the air carries with it a certain amount of\r\ncarbonic acid and ammonia, which the air always contains, and it is\r\nthe whole source of the nitrogen which forms a very important part\r\nof the bodies of plants and animals. When the rain arrives at the\r\nsurface of the earth, it sinks down into it and carries with it all\r\nsoluble vegetable or animal matter which it meets with, together with\r\nany soluble earthy matter which may exist in the soil; this forms\r\nthe sap of the tree. When it arrives at the surface of the leaf, the\r\nwatery part of it combines with the carbonic acid of the air (through\r\nthe influence of light), and appropriating its carbon, gives out the\r\noxygen; this is the true respiration of plants, and is exactly the\r\nreverse of what takes place during the respiration of animals, in which\r\ncase oxygen is absorbed and carbonic acid given off. The carbon thus\r\nretained by the plant combines with the elements of the water to form\r\nthe solid green substance called chlorophyl, which is the basis of\r\nall the tissues of the plant; the ammonia is also decomposed, and its\r\nnitrogen combining with the oxygen and hydrogen of the water, and the\r\ncarbon of the carbonic acid forms those compounds which constitute the\r\nmost nourishing parts of vegetables, such as albumen, gluten, etc.,\r\nand of which all the animal tissues are built up, for the production\r\nof these organic substances takes place in the vegetable only, animals\r\nsimply appropriating them for their food. The sap which reaches the\r\nleaf is not all converted into chlorophyl, but also into those peculiar\r\njuices which are found in plants, some of which contain sugar, some\r\ngum, others (as the pine tribe) turpentine, and in the laurel tribe\r\ncamphor, all of which are substances containing much carbon; moreover\r\nthe solid wood and bark are deposited from these juices as they descend\r\nfrom the leaf after having been acted on by light (or the actinic power\r\nassociated with it). Now, as the water, ammonia, and carbonic acid\r\nwhich descend with the rain are from the air, and as the vegetable\r\nis formed wholly by their absorption, it may be fairly said that the\r\nvegetable kingdom (and therefore the animal) feeds upon the air, and\r\nthat the trees do not grow out of the earth, but into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nFor the groundwork of the system of classification which universally\r\nobtains at present, we are indebted to Linnæus, a Swede, born in\r\n1707. In his classification of plants, Linnæus followed two different\r\nmethods. In the one, he based his division of plants in classes and\r\norders, upon certain peculiarities in the floral organs. This system,\r\nbeing thus founded on characters taken from certain parts of the plant\r\nonly, without reference to others, and having something artificial in\r\nit, has for that reason been termed the _artificial_ system, but it is\r\nnow more generally known as the _Linnæan_ system. In the other method,\r\nhe arranged the plants according to certain general resemblances and\r\naffinities, in natural orders or families. This system, which is known\r\nas the _natural_ system, has subsequently been much improved.\r\n\r\nWe use the term _species_, to designate a number of individual plants,\r\nwhich, in all essential and unvarying characters, resemble each other\r\nmore closely than they do any other plant; the term _genus_ or _kind_,\r\nto designate an assemblage of nearly allied species, agreeing with one\r\nanother in general structure and appearance more closely than they do\r\nwith any other species. Here, too, it must be obvious, that while all\r\nparts of the plant may furnish _specific_ characters, the character of\r\nthe _genera_ are taken exclusively from the parts of fructification.\r\n\r\nIn the name of a plant both the genus and the species are given. The\r\nname designating the genus is called the _generic_ name of the plant,\r\nthe one designating the species, the _specific_ or _trivial_ name.\r\nThus, for instance, we have the genus _Viola_, which includes the\r\nspecies _Viola odorata_, sweet violet; _Viola canina_, dog violet;\r\n_Viola tricolor_, heart’s-ease.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to give the Latin names of plants, as the common name\r\ndiffers, not only in different countries, but even in different parts\r\nof the same country.\r\n\r\nAn assemblage or group of allied genera, agreeing in their general\r\ncharacters, though differing in their special conformation, is called\r\nan _order_ or _family_ of plants.\r\n\r\nThe sunflower, the daisy, the aster, and the dahlia, are, for example,\r\nplants of different genera, but which, all of them, belong to the same\r\norder or family.\r\n\r\nAll plants are divided into three primary classes—viz., _Dicotyledons_,\r\n_Monocotyledons_, and _Acotyledons_, as has been stated already.\r\n\r\nA proper degree of familiarity with the systematic classification of\r\nplants is of the very highest importance to the student. A successful\r\npursuit of this branch of the botanical science presupposes a thorough\r\nknowledge of the structure and physiology of plants, and requires,\r\nmoreover, the aid of attentive observation, and also some diligence in\r\ncollecting and arranging plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIFICIAL OR LINNÆAN SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nIn this system plants are divided into twenty-four classes;\r\ntwenty-three of these contain the _Dicotyledons_ and _Monocotyledons_\r\nindiscriminately; the twenty-fourth class contains the _Acotyledons_.\r\n\r\nThe first twenty-three classes are founded on the number, position,\r\nrelative lengths, and connection of the stamens. The twenty-fourth\r\ncomprises the plants with inconspicuous flowers. Every class is\r\nsubdivided again into several orders. This division depends, in the\r\nfirst thirteen classes, on the number of the styles; in classes XIV.\r\nand XV. on the nature of the fruit; in classes XVI. to XVIII. and\r\nXX. to XXII. on the number of stamens; in classes XIX. and XXIII. on\r\nthe perfection of the flower. In class XXIV. the orders are formed\r\naccording to natural affinities.\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF THE LINNÆAN SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n A.—FLOWERS PRESENT (_Phanerogamia_).\r\n\r\n  I.

Plants exist, animals live and move. Both are organic\r\nbeings, but the latter possess the faculty of _will and spontaneous\r\nmovement_. The animal can leave a place and enjoy other surroundings,\r\nthe plant cannot. We have already crossed the borderland which connects\r\nthe plant and the animal. We have seen plants almost animals. We could\r\ncommence this section with animals which are almost plants, so closely\r\ndo the divisions approach each other. ZOOLOGY is the science of the\r\nknowledge of animals as BOTANY is of the knowledge of plants.\r\n\r\nWhere there is vegetation there are animals, not quadrupeds or bipeds\r\nnecessarily, but numbers of small, it may be invisible, creatures\r\nwhich exist upon the vegetable kingdom—the algæ and minute creations\r\nof globules and cells, the infusoria already mentioned, the corals,\r\netc. And in the “protozoa,” or first specimens of animal life, we have\r\na similarity to the vegetable kingdom; we then get by gradual steps to\r\nother more perfect beings, _each after his kind_, till we arrive at the\r\nmost perfect animal—MAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 826.—Echinus, or Sea-Urchin.]\r\n\r\nAnimals are divided into two families, the INVERTEBRATE and the\r\nVERTEBRATE. The former has no spine nor skeleton; the latter has both.\r\nThese again are divided into sub-families, classes, and orders, as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nMan is an animal—but what is an animal? We can scarcely tell in a\r\nfew words. Linnæus defined the _difference_ between the animal and\r\nthe plant, for the former, said he, live, grow, and feel, while the\r\nlatter live and grow. We have protozoa in the animal kingdom consisting\r\nof a single cell or blood corpuscle, some others without mouths or\r\ndigestive organs, some have no head; some, as in the tape-worm, only a\r\nso-called head, with suckers or attachments, after which it develops\r\njoints, which are at first imperfect, but gradually mature as they are\r\npushed farther away by new-issuing joints.\r\n\r\nAnimals, therefore, do not all possess organs, nor is there any common\r\norgan by which all animals can be classed. The indispensable in one is\r\nabsent in another, and while our mouths and digestive apparatus are\r\nall important, in other animals suckers and no digestive apparatus\r\nat all is quite sufficient. Some have one mouth, some several; some\r\nhave mouths and a proboscis to assist them, some only the trunk and no\r\nmouth—so called—at all, as in some insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 827.—Polypidom.]\r\n\r\nThe organisms which could not be distinguished from vegetables were\r\ntermed zoophytes, or plant animals, and, were space available, a\r\ncomparison might be instituted between the extremes of growth of the\r\nanimals and plants, from the largest whales to the tiny microscopic\r\nprotozoa, and from the mould upon jam to the gigantic trees of\r\nCalifornia, one leaf of which it is said will shelter twenty men from\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nCuvier spent many years in perfecting his systematic arrangements of\r\nanimals, and this classification, though many rearrangements have been\r\nmade as modern discovery progressed, may be regarded as the fundamental\r\nsystem of all. Professor Agassiz adopted it with modifications.\r\nProfessor Nicholson has made a somewhat different arrangement, but\r\nessentially there will be found but slight difference between them. We\r\nappend both these arrangements for comparison:—\r\n\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ-CUVIER.\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\nBRANCH I.—RADIATA.\r\n\r\n Class    I.—_Polypi_        2 orders  Including actinoids\r\n                                        and halcyonoids.\r\n   ”     II.—_Acalephs_      3   ”     hydroids, discophoræ, ctenophoræ.\r\n   ”    III.—_Echinoderms_   4   ”     crinoids, asteroids, echinoids.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANCH II.—MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n Class    I.—_Acephala_      4 orders  bryoza, brachiopods, tunicata,\r\n                                        and lamellibranchiata.\r\n   ”     II.—_Gasteropoda_   3   ”     pipteropoda, heteropoda,\r\n                                        and gasteropoda (proper).\r\n   ”    III.—_Cephalopoda_   2   ”     tetrabranchiata, and dibranchiata.\r\n\r\nBRANCH III.—ARTICULATA.\r\n\r\n Class    I.—_Worms_         3 orders  trematods (including leeches,\r\n                                        etc.), nematoids, and annelides.\r\n\r\n   ”     II.—_Crustacea_     4   ”     rotifera, crinopods, tetradecapods,\r\n                                        and decapods.\r\n\r\n   ”    III.—_Insects_       3   ”     myriapods, arachnoids, and insects\r\n                                        proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANCH IV.—VERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\n Class    I.—_Myzontes_      2 orders  myxinoids and cyclostomes.\r\n\r\n   ”     II.—Fishes proper.\r\n\r\n   ”    III.—_Ganoids_       3   ”     cælacanths, axipenseroids, and\r\n                                        sauroids.\r\n\r\n   ”     IV.—_Selachiens_    3   ”     chimæræ, galeodes, and batides.\r\n\r\n   ”      V.—_Amphibians_    3   ”     cæciliæ, ichthyodi, and anoura.\r\n\r\n   ”     VI.—_Reptiles_      4   ”     serpents, saurii, rhizodontes,\r\n                                        and testudinata.\r\n\r\n   ”    VII.—_Birds_         4   ”     natatores, grallæ, rasores,\r\n                                        and incessores.\r\n\r\n   ”   VIII.—_Mammalia_      3   ”     marsupiaia, herbivora,\r\n                                        and carnivora.\r\n\r\nIn the vertebrated animals the blood is red in consequence of the\r\nminute cells (_corpuscles_) which contain the colouring matter. In\r\ninvertebrate animals these red cells are absent, and so the animals are\r\nwhite-blooded. Some animals, again, are cold-blooded like the fish;\r\nbirds and mammalia have warm blood. It is worthy of remark that the\r\nhigher we advance in the scale the fewer the offspring of the animal.\r\nThe animalcules multiply at the rate of many billions a day, and even\r\none codfish is stated to contain more than nine millions of eggs. A\r\nmackerel will produce 500,000; and so on, as we rise, we find mammals\r\nwith seldom more than ten young at a time, down to one single offspring.\r\n\r\nWe could fill pages with the account of the differences existing\r\nbetween animals created for such different purposes and fitted to\r\ninhabit different climates, their mode of feeding and catching prey.\r\nThe manner of bringing forth and rearing the young, and the temperament\r\nand temper of the animal creation would fill a volume, but we cannot\r\nnow stay to examine these various characteristics.

Animals\r\nwhich correspond to this class are termed Protozoa, from the Greek,\r\n_proton_, first, and _zoön_, animal. The former are, as already\r\nmentioned, seen amongst the algæ, consisting of simple cells, and\r\nprotozoa cannot easily be distinguished from them except in the matter\r\nof nutriment, for some protozoa have no mouth except in the _infusoria_\r\nclass. The cells are very much alike, and Dr. Carpenter sums them up\r\nbriefly as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The animal cell, in its most complete form, is comparable in most\r\nparts of its structure to that of the plant, but differs from it\r\nin the entire absence of the ‘cellulose wall’ or of anything that\r\nrepresents it, the cell-contents being enclosed in only a single\r\nlimitary membrane, the chemical composition of which, being albuminous,\r\nindicates its correspondence with the primordial utricle. In its\r\nyoung state it seems always to contain a semi-fluid plasma, which is\r\nessentially the same as the protoplasm of the plant, save that it\r\ndoes not include chlorophyl granules, and this may either continue\r\nto occupy its cavity (which is the case in cells whose entire energy\r\nis directed to growth and multiplication), or may give place, either\r\nwholly or in part, to the special product which it may be the function\r\nof the cell to prepare. Like the vegetable cell, that of animals very\r\ncommonly multiplies by duplicative subdivision, it also (especially\r\namong protozoa) may give origin to new cells by the breaking up of its\r\ncontents into several particles.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 828.—Animalculæ found in stagnant water.\r\n\r\n  A, Cyclops Quadracornis.\r\n  B, Anguillula.

The infusoria are the highest of\r\nthe protozoa, and were formerly included amongst the radiata. Their\r\nnumbers are infinite, and in a drop of water (_see_ fig. 828) some\r\nvery interesting specimens will be found. These infusoria are merely\r\n_sarcode_, or a jelly-like substance, and some have cilia, or hairy\r\nappendages, with which they agitate the water and cause a kind of\r\ncurrent which brings them food. It is this partaking of food which\r\nhas served to divide the lowest animal from the lowest vegetable\r\ncreations. There is no progressive increase of development from the\r\nlowest plant to the highest animal. The animal begins by himself, as\r\nit were, as the plant, and both grow up in different directions. The\r\nprotozoa exist upon organic substances, while plants absorb inorganic\r\nsubstances and assimilate them.\r\n\r\nThe _Gregarinidæ_ are very tiny cells, and though microscopically\r\nminute, they sometimes develop into worm-like or elongated oval bodies.\r\nThey inhabit the intestines of crustacea, worms, and cockroaches, as\r\nwell as of higher animals. They are capable of certain motion, but\r\nare not furnished even with the “false feet” (_pseudo podia_) of the\r\nrhizopoda, the next animal in these very low scales of creation.\r\n\r\nOf the Rhizopoda the AMEBÆ are very interesting, and we find them in\r\nour veins as well as in the stagnant green water of the pond. They\r\nare simply _sarcode_ or jelly, and, as the name implies, the amebæ\r\ncan change their appearance (_amoibos_, changing). They possess a\r\nkind of crawling, progressive motion, and under the microscope will\r\nbe perceived to develop a tiny bud, as it were, which is the “false\r\nfoot” that assists its progress. These amebæ are in our blood moving\r\nabout, and are always altering their form, and when warm they move more\r\nquickly in the red blood corpuscles or cells, but excessive heat will\r\nkill them.\r\n\r\nThese curious creatures feed by the foot they protrude; and by drawing\r\nin the “process” as it is termed, they can collect within themselves\r\nthe nourishment they require. Of course they have no mouth, and if we\r\ncan conceive a creature of this kind which thrusts out from a jelly-bag\r\na tiny lump, and pulls it in again at any time and place it likes, we\r\nhave an idea of an ameba.\r\n\r\nThe pond ameba is somewhat different from the others, inasmuch as it\r\npossesses an outer and inner portion or layer which are different in\r\ndensity. There is what is termed a contractile vesicle which “beats” as\r\na heart beats, but this is very primitive. There is really no structure\r\nwhatever in these rhizopoda, and, as we have seen, their shape is\r\nalways undergoing change. The outer and inner layers of the amebæ are\r\ncalled “the ectosarc” and “endosarc” respectively; the latter contains\r\nthe darker portion—the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe _Foraminifera_ have already been mentioned in the chapters on\r\nGeology. We find these minute creatures must have had a great deal\r\nto do with the building up of rocks, as they have the power to make\r\ntiny coverings for themselves, which have been built into rocks by the\r\naddition of sandy particles, and consolidated by pressure. Here we\r\nhave a most wonderful instance of the tiniest creatures producing the\r\ngreatest masses of the earth. The body is merely _sarcode_, the shell\r\nis carbonate of lime. The foraminifera produce false feet in abundance,\r\nwhich surround the cell like fine hairs or rays. They live in the sea,\r\nand when they die the shells descend upon the ocean floor, where they\r\nundergo many changes and become converted into rock. The ooze of the\r\ngreat oceans is composed of these shells, and is practically a chalky\r\ndeposit; the shells are being built up as in former ages with the\r\ncurious nummulites of the Eocene formation, which are amongst the most\r\ninteresting of fossils.\r\n\r\nSPONGES. We must go on at once to the _Sponges_, which form such an\r\ninteresting subject as they are so familiar to us all. Sponge is\r\nnot often regarded by the public as an animal, and though perhaps\r\nauthorities may not have yet concluded in what category they should be\r\nplaced, we may consider them here according to the list.\r\n\r\nWe find the spongida both in fresh and salt water, and they have\r\ngiven rise to much discussion as to whether they should be classed as\r\nanimals at all. But that question having been finally settled, we can\r\nproceed to examine a sponge in its native state, and we shall find both\r\nskeleton and “flesh.”\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is hard and composed of needles of “tiny” texture. The\r\nflesh is “sarcode,” and the animal possesses no mouth, but is full\r\nof holes (pores) and canals through which the water is continually\r\ndistributed. The outer layer of the sponge is formed of ultimate\r\ncomponents of the living substance of the sponge (like the amebæ we\r\nhave been considering). Each contains a nucleus, and when joined\r\ntogether form the outer layer of the body. Beneath is a wide cavity\r\ncommunicating with the exterior by means of minute holes, and filled\r\nwith water. The cavity separates the superficial layer from the deeper\r\nsubstance, which is of the same character. In the water passages of the\r\nsponge are cilia which induce a cement, and the interior canals develop\r\ninto chambers lined with sponge particles, and the water carries\r\nparticles to the sponge, which represents a kind of sub-aqueous city,\r\nwhere the people are arranged about the streets and roads in such a\r\nmanner that each can easily appropriate his food from the water as it\r\npasses along.[38]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 829.—Fragment of sponge (magnified).]\r\n\r\nSponge, then, is a mass of living organisms—tiny living creatures\r\ncapable of feeding and of movement, resembling amebæ or perhaps\r\ninfusoria, with cilia, to enable them to obtain nourishment by a\r\nkind of inhalation or respiration. They are reproductive by sexual\r\nand a-sexual processes which produce _spongellæ_. The living sponge\r\nis a beautifully coloured animal, and grows upon almost any solid\r\nfoundation; and in the autumn the parent sponge displays a number of\r\nyellow dots or “gemmules,” which are the young. These are soon cast off\r\nand left to shift for themselves, and seek their fortunes, helpless\r\nas they appear, in the wide and stormy sea. At last they find a\r\nresting-place, and fix themselves for ever, growing up and reproducing\r\ntheir species until they are carried off to be sold and used in\r\ncivilized countries for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nWe must leave these curious animalculæ and glance at the INFUSORIA,\r\nwhich constitute a higher branch, but microscopic and universal, and\r\ninclude those called Flagellate, Ciliate, and Tentaculate. The first\r\nhave whip-like cilia, or feelers, or filaments, which are ever in\r\nmotion to cause a movement of the water and carry food to the animal.\r\nYou will find plenty of infusoria in any stagnant water, and when\r\nplaced under the microscope a mouth may be perceived, but no stomach,\r\nnor any apparent receptacle for food, which appears to enter at once\r\ninto the body substance. The other kinds capture their food by seizure\r\nby the tentacles, or by agitating the cilia, like the flagellata, and\r\nthus whipping the nourishment towards the mouth, as children will draw\r\nin a toy boat to land by agitating the water in the given direction.\r\nThese cilia, or hairs, serve for organs of locomotion as well as of\r\ncapture. These creatures are called Infusoria, because they exist in\r\nvegetable “infusions” exposed to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 830.—Structure of polypidoms.]\r\n\r\nDecaying vegetable or animal substances, such as the leaves of trees,\r\ngrass, a piece of flesh, etc., affused with water and exposed to air\r\nand warmth, will speedily, upon microscopic examination, be found\r\npeopled with numbers of most active minute creatures of the most varied\r\nforms. These animalcules are found also in the stagnant pools around\r\nour cities, in the waters of rivers, harbours, and lakes, and even in\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the origin of these animalcules, the view was long\r\nentertained that they were generated spontaneously, that the decaying\r\nvegetable and animal substances were decomposed and resolved into\r\nthese simple beings. More accurate experiments have shown, however,\r\nthat the infusoria are produced from ova, or germs, which are probably\r\ncarried about in the dried-up state, in the form of minute particles of\r\ndust,[39] ready to develop themselves in any spot which may afford them\r\nthe requisite moisture and nutriment. In this respect they resemble\r\nthe microscopic fungi, whose germs are diffused in the same way. When\r\nonce they have obtained the means of development, they multiply with\r\nincredible celerity. If the decaying vegetable or animal substances be\r\ncarefully excluded from contact with the air, or if the air be heated\r\nbefore it is admitted to them, no infusoria will appear. They are\r\nrarely developed on mountains of a certain height, where the atmosphere\r\nis free from foreign bodies.\r\n\r\nThough these animalcules are so exceedingly minute, yet the forms\r\nexhibited by them are extremely various, and some of them present also\r\nconsiderable variety in the forms assumed by the same individual under\r\ndifferent circumstances. In many species the soft body is enclosed in a\r\nfirm integument, strengthened by a deposit of siliceous matter; these\r\nenvelopes, which are often preserved after the death of the animals,\r\nare termed the _shields_, and the animalcules encased in them are\r\ncalled _loricated_ infusoria. The remarkable discovery has been made\r\nthat large distinct beds of former formations are entirely made up of\r\nthe accumulated remains of these animalcules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 831.—Volvox globator.]\r\n\r\nWe arrive at the HYDROZOA after leaving the Infusoria, and find\r\nourselves in the sea, and far from land, where it will be difficult\r\nfor us to ascertain the characteristics of these interesting animals.\r\nBut fortunately we can obtain much nearer home, and occasionally in\r\na private aquarium, a specimen of the hydrozoa which will serve our\r\npurpose, as it has served before to introduce readers to the study of\r\nthese water-polypes, some of which are so like plants that they are\r\nfrequently mistaken for them.\r\n\r\nThe hydrozoa present a “definite histological structure,” says\r\nProfessor Huxley; “the body always exhibits a separation into at least\r\ntwo distinct layers of tissue, an outer and an inner.” The Hydras, or\r\nfresh-water polypes, which may be found in nearly every pond adhering\r\nto the duckweed, appears like tubes, and if touched will curl up into\r\ntiny knobs. But if let alone they will adhere to a glass by their\r\nsingle foot, or sucker, which can be moved at pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 832.—The hydra.]\r\n\r\nThe foot, or sucker, is continued to a slender cylindrical stalk, from\r\nthe end of which radiate a number of tentacles, or “feelers,” growing\r\naround the mouth, and serving to convey or attract food to the animal\r\nwhich is, so to speak, all stomach. There is no breathing apparatus,\r\nand what food it cannot digest is expelled from the mouth. The\r\npeculiarity which has given the hydra its name is, that no matter into\r\nhow many pieces you cut this polype, the parts cut off will all develop\r\ninto little polypes perfect as their parent.[40] But germination is\r\ncarried on naturally by buds thrown out, and cast (by “gemmation”), or\r\nby the ordinary sexual production of ova.\r\n\r\nThe outer and inner skins of the hydra are called the ectoderm and\r\nendoderm, and the animal is quite capable of locomotion, walking,\r\nor rather moving, backwards, by raising and planting its sucker or\r\nfoot, and by swimming. The prey is captured by the tentacles and by\r\nthe darting out of tiny spears from the cells or “thread cells” which\r\ncontain them on the surface of the body. The well-known “Portuguese\r\nman-of-war,” an ocean polype, has these “harpoons” greatly developed,\r\nand can inflict serious pain as of many stinging nettles; the sensation\r\nis exceedingly painful, and lasts some time.\r\n\r\nThe MEDUSIDÆ are known to the seaside visitor as the jelly-fish, and\r\nthe other _Acalephæ_, the “hidden-eyed” medusæ, include the Portuguese\r\nman-of-war mentioned above, and many other umbrella-like animals. They\r\nhave received the name of medusæ from Medusa, whose long, snaky locks\r\nthe tentacles of the animals are supposed to be like. Some of these\r\n“floating umbrellas” are very dangerous, and will inflict severe stings\r\nupon any one in their vicinity. The tentacles or filaments extend for\r\na long distance, and bathers should be cautious. We have often watched\r\nthem, and they are beautiful to contemplate particularly at night, and\r\nin Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, many exceedingly fine specimens have\r\nbeen obtained. The pulsation of the “umbrella” or bell, enables the\r\nanimal to swim, and the even undulations of this beautiful covering are\r\napparently caused by nervous contractions.\r\n\r\nThe jelly-fish have no resemblance to “fish,” and scarcely appear to\r\nexist; they are of no use to man, and when removed from the water\r\ndwindle by little and little to a tiny film and nothing more—they\r\ndissolve into air and water. Cases have been known and tales told of\r\nhow farmers collected hundreds of these jelly-fish for manure, and when\r\nthe cart reached the field, to the man’s astonishment, nothing was left\r\nbut what appeared cobweb in the place of the load of fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 833.—Medusa.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cyclippe_ is a very common specimen, and moves by means of its\r\ncilia; _Cestum Veneris_—the zone or girdle of Venus—is another curious\r\nexample. It appears like a glass ribbon about five inches wide and\r\nperhaps four or five feet long. The cilia when in motion are very\r\nbrilliant in colouring, and the creature undulates through the water\r\nin a remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nThe luminosity of the medusæ is clearly perceived, the so-called\r\nphosphorescence being due chiefly to the minute jelly-fish which\r\nabound near the surface of the sea. It appears impossible, for most,\r\nat any rate, if not all, these medusæ to sink beneath the surface, for\r\nthey can be found in hundreds cast ashore, melting away into film. We\r\nmight imagine that they would be provided with some means of sinking\r\nthemselves, but being apparently only air and water, it is necessary\r\nfor them to remain upon the surface to exist at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 834.—Sea cucumber.]\r\n\r\nThe term _Acalephæ_, by which they are known, means “stinging” fish or\r\nsea-nettles, the Greek word meaning nettle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ACTINOZOA comprise corals and the popular sea anemones (actinidæ).\r\nThey resemble the hydrozoa in possessing tentacles, and also the two\r\ninner and outer tissues of the body. But they differ from the hydrozoa\r\nin their interior arrangement in the possession of a kind of stomach\r\nbetween the “body cavity” and the mouth which the hydrozoa do not\r\npossess. The appearance of the sea anemone is well known. It fixes\r\nitself by the flat base and hangs out its tentacles to obtain food.\r\nWhen we touch an anemone with a stick we perceive how it contracts\r\nitself, but there is no nervous system nor any respiration. The\r\nreproduction of its species is carried on within, not as in other\r\nanimals, like the hydra, by exterior budding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 835.—Coral.]\r\n\r\nThe corals belong to the same class as the sea anemones, and are\r\ncalled zoanthidæ. We have already in previous portions of this volume\r\nmentioned the “coral” building polypes, but we may again describe them\r\nhere. We have the black coral or _antipathidæ_, which live in masses\r\nand are united by a stem. They grow upon this fleshy trunk and cover\r\nit in time “just as a trunk of a tree is covered by the bark.” This\r\nstem is called a _cænosarc_, which secretes the coral, or skeleton. The\r\n_madrepores_ are the greatest producers of the coral of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 836.—Coral.]\r\n\r\n“If we examine a simple coral of this group,” says Professor Nicholson,\r\n“we find that we have to deal with an animal in all important respects\r\nidentical with an ordinary sea anemone, but having a more or less\r\ncomplicated skeleton developed in its interior.” This skeleton is the\r\ncorallum, and it is composed, as most people are aware, of calcareous\r\nmatter deposited within the polype itself; in the former case the\r\ndevelopment or formation is exterior to the polype. A single polype\r\nwill thus secrete a deposit, and a colony of them produce a compound\r\nskeleton, and as they throw out buds or young polypes, the manufacture\r\nof skeletons goes on by secretion.\r\n\r\nThe _Tubipores_ are like pipes, and the coral has been termed the\r\n“organ-pipe.” It is formed cylindrically and joined externally. As\r\nunder GEOLOGY we have examined the question of coral reefs, we need not\r\nhere recapitulate the descriptions given in that section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 837.—Coral.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Bariel writes of these animals as follows:—“By far the greater\r\npart of the Zoanthoid polypes, as they grow, deposit in the cellular\r\nsubstance of the flesh of their back an immense quantity of calcareous\r\nmatter which enlarges as the animal increases in size, and, in fact,\r\nfills up those portions of the substance of the animal, which by the\r\ngrowth of new parts are no longer wanted for its nourishment, and in\r\nthis manner they form a hard and strong case, amongst the folds of\r\nwhich they contract themselves so as to be protected from external\r\ninjury, and by the same means they form for themselves a permanent\r\nattachment which prevents their being tossed about by every wave of the\r\nelement in which they live. The stony substances so formed are called\r\ncorals, and their mode of formation causes them exactly to represent\r\nthe animal which secretes them. The upper surface is always furnished\r\nwith radiating plates, the remains of the calcareous particles which\r\nare deposited in the longitudinal folds of the stomach.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Huxley. “Classification of Animals.”\r\n\r\n[39] That the presence of millions of such ova in the air should not\r\nbe detected, will appear very natural indeed, if we reflect that the\r\nanimalcules are only 1/1500 to 1/2000 part of a line in diameter, and\r\nthat the ova are a thousand times smaller.\r\n\r\n[40] Hercules conquered the “Hydra,” which is represented in mythology\r\nas capable of reproducing two heads for each one cut off by the\r\nwarrior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nECHINODERMATA—ANNULOSA—ENTOZOA—INSECTA.\r\n\r\n SEA-URCHINS—STAR-FISHES—FEATHERY\r\n STARS—SEA-CUCUMBERS—WORMS—LEECHES—ROTIFERS—TAPE WORMS—INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECHINODERMATA or spiny-skinned, are most commonly represented by\r\nthe sea-urchins and star-fishes of our coasts. In some of the classes\r\nlocomotion is performed by means of these spines or prickles, which\r\nserve as legs. In others, movement is carried on by suckers and tubes\r\nas in the star-fishes, these tubes being also the means whereby the\r\nanimal obtains its food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 838.—Sea-urchin (echinus), with and without spines.]\r\n\r\nThey have a digestive system, and possess a curiously horny skin\r\neven when spines are absent. The mouth is in the centre. We give an\r\nillustration of the sea-urchin, and of a section of a spine, which is\r\na beautiful object when seen under the microscope, for these spines\r\ncan be made quite transparent when cut across and ground. The shelly\r\ncovering is porous, and as the animal grows the shell is added to at\r\nthe edges. Underneath will be found the mouth, which has teeth fitted\r\nfor devouring the small crustacea. These sea-urchins abound, and their\r\nporous shells may be picked up frequently after a storm.\r\n\r\nThe star-fishes are well known to all searchers amongst the rocks and\r\nthose who study the shore, and are often taken home for an aquarium.\r\nThey are very voracious, however, and when one is examined in a glass\r\nof sea-water, the observer will detect many suckers protruding from\r\neach of the rays. It is by means of these suckers, which are put forth\r\nfrom innumerable little holes called “ambulacral apertures,” that the\r\nstar-fish makes his way up the rocks and along the ocean bed. The\r\nstomach of the star-fish is extensive, and situated in the centre of\r\nthe rays wherein is a digestive apparatus. The rays are composed of\r\ndetached but beautifully fitted pieces, so united as to be flexible,\r\nand around the mouth and in strong frame-work. The star-fish has no\r\nteeth, but manages to dispose of a vast quantity of matter, which if\r\nleft alone would be injurious in decay.\r\n\r\nThus Nature has provided a shore scavenger to devour what would be\r\nharmful, just as the vulture on land eats the carrion. Besides this\r\nkind of refuse food, the star-fish eats small crustaceans, and oysters\r\nfall victims to him. By embracing the shell the star-fish manages to\r\ninsert itself, and if it cannot bring the oyster out to its mouth,\r\nit will quietly turn out its mouth into the oyster-shell, and save\r\nthe bivalve any trouble in the matter. Some writers declare that the\r\nstar-fish stupefies or poisons its victim, and then the shell opens.\r\nThese asteroidea can reproduce a ray that has been injured or cut off,\r\nor they can break themselves to pieces if caught.\r\n\r\nThe brittle stars and feather stars appertain to the order of the\r\nOphiuroida or “serpent-armed,” because the rays are more flexible and\r\nthin than the common star-fish. But they differ very much from the\r\nstar-fish in the arrangement, as well as in the shape of their arms.\r\nThe former possesses rays which form an appendage of the stomach and\r\nenclose it. In the brittle stars the rays are limbs, and could be\r\ndetached without taking the life of the animal, except in so far as to\r\ndeprive it of means to obtain its food. The body is quite independent\r\nof the rays, the mouth occupying the centre, and is surrounded by\r\nminute suckers. The stars are much more flexible than the star-fishes,\r\ntheir rays are longer, and serve either as feet, fins, tentacles, or\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 839.—Spine of echinus (A, natural size; B, a\r\nsection magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe crinoids also belong to the Echinodermata, and resemble plants more\r\nthan star-fish. They are fixed upon a stalk like a flower, growing\r\nupright from the sea-bottom, and the body is called a _calyx_, which\r\nis composed of a ventral and dorsal surface. The arms branch out from\r\nthe calyx, just as a small tree does, and if we can imagine one of the\r\nlast planted trees on the Thames embankment reduced to half a finger’s\r\nlength or less, we have a sort of idea of the crinoid “in the rough.”\r\n\r\nA polype supported on a stem branching out in feathery, grassy-looking\r\narms represents the Encrinites, the remains of which are found as\r\nfossils. The arms of the crinoids are subdivided, and quite a flowery\r\ncrown may in time result. The animal obtains its food by the motion of\r\ncilia. The stem and the branches are jointed, as it were, and capable\r\nof flexible movement in any direction. The crinoids remain stationary\r\nduring their lives.\r\n\r\nThe care taken by the star-fish of its young is remarkable. It carries\r\nthe eggs about in its suckers and with great caution. The young remain\r\nattached to the mother until they are able to go about alone, and then\r\nthe physical attachments die off, and the asteroidea goes forth to\r\nseek its fortune in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe echinus, already mentioned, is a most elaborately constructed\r\nanimal; the plates being secreted from the soft parts are ever being\r\nrenewed as the animal gets older and larger. The whole subject is well\r\nworth a long independent study, of which it is here impossible for us\r\nto give the results.\r\n\r\nThe sea-cucumbers are more like the familiar garden slug than any other\r\nanimal, and are surmounted by a fringe round the mouth which looks\r\nlike leaves. The surface is moist, and has no horny covering like the\r\n“urchin,” or star fish, but the suckers are present and are used for\r\nlocomotion. The tentacles round the mouth serve as prehensile organs.\r\nThe “alimentary canal” is most curiously curved, and of great length,\r\nand the animal can turn itself “inside out” with great facility if\r\nalarmed. It possesses a kind of breathing apparatus, and may be classed\r\nas the most highly organized of all the Echinodermata. These cucumbers\r\nare much esteemed by the Chinese, and “trepang,” as they are called,\r\nare caught by thousands in Australian waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNULOSA.\r\n\r\nThe worm-like animals are divided into sections, which include\r\nintestinal worms, entozoa, annelida, and crustacea, with the worms,\r\nspiders, and insects classed in each section. We may at once perceive\r\nwhat a very extensive division the _Annulosa_ is, and we must devote\r\nsome space to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 840.—Earth worm (_lumbricus terrestris_), leech\r\n(_hirudo medicinale_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Rotifers_, or “wheel animalculæ,” are included in this class;\r\nthey stand almost alone, and certainly invisible to the naked eye.\r\nThey are very curious animals, as will be seen from the accompanying\r\nillustration. The motion of the cilia around the mouth gives the\r\nwhirling movement from which their name is derived (fig. 841).\r\n\r\nThe ANNELIDES, or worms, include earth-worms, water-worms, leeches,\r\netc. The appearance of the earth-worm is so common that few people\r\ncomparatively studied it until Mr. Darwin’s book took the amateur\r\nreader by surprise and delighted him, and to that volume we must refer\r\nour readers for details of these very interesting animals, termed\r\nannelides because of the rings appearing upon their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe common _leech_ is well known in medicine. It is curiously enough\r\nan inhabitant of ponds and lakes, and in such conditions has no\r\nopportunities for tasting the warm blood for which it develops such a\r\nliking when opportunity offers. This is really a remarkable fact, that\r\nthe animal should be placed in a position naturally in which its most\r\nnatural tendencies should remain unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe progression of the leech is performed by undulating movements and\r\nthe prehensile action of the suckers—head and tail. The eyes are ten\r\nin number, near the mouth and at the top of the head. The mouth is\r\nfurnished with numerous tri-radiate teeth, but in some leeches they are\r\nnot sharp, as in the “medicinal” variety. It is known that both sexes\r\nare represented in every leech, but they are not self-reproductive.\r\n\r\nThe earth-worm, so familiar to all, has been lately raised into\r\nimportance. It lives in clay, and bores its way through the ground.\r\nIt feeds upon organic matter contained in the earth, and when it has\r\nassimilated the nourishing particles, it ejects the remainder in small\r\nheaps of soft dirt, which are visible after rain particularly. The\r\nworm, by its burrowing, turns up the land, and vastly increases its\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 841.—Wheel animalcule (_rotifer vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe earth-worm in its outer structure resembles the leech, but, as any\r\none will at once perceive, the worm is not furnished with suckers by\r\nwhich it can assist itself to move. Instead of these rounded terminals\r\nthe worm is finely pointed, and thus capable of boring its way through\r\nthe earth. Progression is accomplished by moving first the head portion\r\nand then the next, so that a regular series of movements is necessary.\r\nThe minute spines or bristles of the worm prevent its body being\r\nretracted by muscular effort.\r\n\r\nThe vital organs are rather forward of the centre of the body, and so\r\nif a worm be cut behind them it will survive and reproduce a tail.\r\nBut the portion cut off will not be found alive, nor is it capable of\r\nforming a new perfect worm as generally supposed.\r\n\r\nThere are many other orders of worms which we can only indicate—viz.,\r\nthe _Tubicolæ_ which surround themselves with a hard case; the\r\n_Errantia_, or sea-worms, sand-worms, etc., like the lobworm used\r\nfor bait, and the naiads of our fresh-water ponds, all of which are\r\nsuited to the aquatic life they lead. Indeed, of all the annelides, the\r\nearth-worm is the only specimen that is suited for living upon land. As\r\nregards the last mentioned, we may add that worms do not prey upon dead\r\nbodies as is so generally imagined. They are vegetable feeders, and do\r\nnot burrow very deeply.\r\n\r\nThe transparent condition of the Rotifers renders them easy of\r\nobservation under the microscope, and we find a nervous system,\r\nintestines, and a developed stomach. They are fresh-water inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Entozoa or “intestinal” worms claim a brief notice at our hands.\r\nThe entozoa are those beings which inhabit, as parasites, the\r\nintestines and other parts of animals. Their history is still obscure,\r\nbut there seems to be about twenty varieties of these creatures, and\r\na great number of animals have their peculiar entozoa. The best known\r\nin the human subject are the “Ascaris” or thread-worm, the “Lumbricus\r\nTeres” or long-worm, and the “Tænia” or tape-worm; this last is\r\njointed, and grows to several yards in length.\r\n\r\nThe development of these Tænia is one of the most curious performances\r\nof nature. Each of the joints shown in the illustration below (fig.\r\n842) is a perfected and mature proglottis, containing the ova or\r\neggs, which can only be brought to perfection when swallowed by a\r\nwarm-blooded animal (not the same from which they emanated). The head\r\nwithin the embryo then holds to the tissues and penetrates to the\r\nalimentary canal, where only it can redevelop joints from the so-called\r\nhead, which has no organs and merely pushes out immature joints which\r\nare continued, and they become more mature the farther they are pushed\r\nout by the new ones. The “measles” of the pig are produced by the ova\r\nof these worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 842.—Tape worm (_proglottides_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODA.\r\n\r\nThe “many-footed” annulosa include the centipedes and millipedes, and\r\nmay be regarded as a connecting link between the worms and the insects.\r\nThe heads of these animals are distinct from the body.\r\n\r\nThe millipedes can be any day found under a large stone in a field\r\nwhich has not been tilled, or any place where a stone has been suffered\r\nto remain for some time undisturbed. These specimens are of the\r\npill-millipede order, because they roll themselves up into a ball when\r\ndisturbed. The myriapods of this country are not of large dimensions,\r\nbut in tropical climates they attain a great size. The giant centipede\r\nhas been found in South America more than a foot long, and is capable\r\nof inflicting severe wounds, its tenacity being extraordinary and\r\nequalling that of the bull-dog when once it has gripped its enemy.\r\n\r\nThe myriapods have no wings; they possess antennæ, and numerous,\r\nnever less than eighteen, feet,—frequently twenty pairs, but never a\r\nthousand, much less “ten thousand” feet, as the class name indicates.\r\nThey are provided with strong forceps or “foot-jaws,” which supply a\r\npoison for killing their enemies. The millipedes and centipedes are\r\nknown scientifically as Iulidæ and Scolopendridæ respectively, and in\r\nmost points of internal arrangement resemble insects, such as breathing\r\nby spiracles or (stomates), and trachæ or tubes. Some of the centipedes\r\npossess electric qualities, and can administer a shock to an opponent.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTA.\r\n\r\nInsects inhabit the world around us in myriad forms in air and earth\r\nand water. Some exist for a very brief space in the air; others live\r\nunder water, or in trees, or in the ground; some burrow and hide in\r\nchinks of rocks and under stones. The numbers are countless, and all\r\nhave some function to perform as palpably as the busy honey-bee, or as\r\nmysteriously as the giddy, careless butterfly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 843.—Anatomy of the external skeleton of an insect.]\r\n\r\nInsects are divided into three distinct parts,—viz., the _head_, the\r\n_thorax_, and the _abdomen_, and each of these parts has a pair of legs\r\nattached to it, as will be perceived from the accompanying diagram.\r\nAlong the body are tubes called trachæ,—for insects do not breathe by\r\nlungs,—by which the air is carried into the system of the insect, by\r\nthe “spiracles” or openings of fine network, to prevent dust entering\r\nthe air-passages. The head is joined to the body by a constricted neck,\r\nthe part of the body to which it is joined is called the thorax, and to\r\nthis is added the posterior part or abdomen; this part is extremely\r\nvarious in form in different insects; in some it is round and full,\r\nin others long and extended. The antennæ arise from the head, and are\r\ngenerally composed of eleven pieces variously disposed; these wonderful\r\norgans are possessed of great sensibility, and they certainly serve to\r\nconvey information to the insect, of the nature of one of the special\r\nsenses; it was formerly thought to be simply that of touch very much\r\nrefined, or of smell, but it is now generally considered to be that\r\nof hearing, or a modification of it. The forms of the antennæ are\r\nvery various; fig. 845 represents that of the cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_). The legs proceed from the thorax as do the wings, the\r\nabdomen giving rise to none of the extremities; the feet of insects are\r\nall pretty much upon the same model, some being more developed than\r\nothers, they have a pair of hooks or claws for catching and clinging to\r\nrough surfaces, and a pair of cushions or pads, covered in some cases\r\nwith suckers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 844.—Spiracle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 845.—Antenna of cockchafer (_melolontha vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe foot of the common house-fly is most beautifully fitted for its\r\nprogression and support. We have often wondered how the fly manages to\r\nsupport itself back downwards on the ceiling, or walk up glass. We give\r\na cut of the fly’s foot (fig. 846).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 846.—Foot of fly, magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe eyes of insects are also marvellous. There are only two, but each\r\none is composed of numerous cells (ocelli), and look like a honey-comb.\r\n(_See_ illustration, fig. 847.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 847.—Compound eye. 1. Perpendicular section; 2.\r\nSurface.]\r\n\r\nInsects swarm in innumerable companies, and no one who has not seen\r\nthe locusts descending upon the earth can form more than a faint idea\r\nof the devastation they occasion in an incredibly short time. These,\r\nas well as thousands of other insects, exist in myriads, and we must\r\ncontent ourselves, on this occasion, by merely noting the different\r\norders and their characteristics, after we have mentioned some of the\r\nattributes common to all.\r\n\r\nThe term “insect” means cut into or divided, and so the insecta are\r\ndivided, as already mentioned, into three parts,—head, thorax, and\r\nabdomen,—the thorax being subdivided into three rings, _pro_-thorax,\r\n_meso_-thorax, and _meta_-thorax—beginning, middle, and end. All\r\ninsects have six legs, and usually two or four wings, though some have\r\nno wings at all. The legs are united to the _thorax_, the antennæ and\r\neyes to the head. The abdomen contains the important sexual organs, a\r\nsting or defensive weapon, and in females the egg chamber.\r\n\r\nInsects breathe by tubes in the sides, and consume a great quantity\r\nof air. Their powers of flying and leaping are too familiar to\r\nneed dwelling upon. The wings display beautiful colours like those\r\nobservable in the soap-bubble, others are covered with scales or hairs.\r\nThe mouths vary very much with the species, as the manner of obtaining\r\nfood is by suction or gnawing. The blood of insects is pale and thin.\r\n\r\nThe various transformations which insects undergo are always a subject\r\nof interest for the young student. The ugly forms which develop in\r\nbeautiful creations are more astonishing than the change of the “ugly\r\nduckling” into the graceful swan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 848.—Larva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 849.—Pupa.]\r\n\r\nInsects come to maturity only after undergoing successive changes\r\nfrom the egg to the perfect animal. The eggs (some of which are very\r\nbeautiful) are first deposited in some safe place, either attached\r\nto a leaf or tied up in a small bundle by silken threads spun by the\r\nparent insect, and in some nutritious substance, so that when it\r\ncomes to life it may at once have food; this is sometimes in manure,\r\nsometimes in flesh, and sometimes under the skin of a living animal\r\n(few are exempt from this infliction), where they remain for a time\r\nand then come forth as maggots, caterpillars, etc.; in this state they\r\nare called _larvæ_,—these are generally active creatures and eat most\r\nvoraciously, which seems to be the principal act of this state of their\r\nexistence. These larvæ frequently change their skins as they grow,\r\nand at last they assume the next stage of their life, the _pupa_ or\r\nchrysalis state, which is one generally of complete inactivity; many of\r\nthese larvæ weave themselves a covering of a sort of silk, to defend\r\nthem while in the pupa state,—such as the silkworm, whose covering\r\n(cocoon) is the source of all the silk of commerce,—others merely place\r\nthemselves in a situation of security. The pupa remains dormant for a\r\ncertain time, and then becomes the _imago_ or perfect insect (the last\r\nstate of its existence), such as a moth, a butterfly, a beetle, etc.\r\nThese are of different sexes, and in due time produce a batch of eggs\r\nand then die; these eggs are often incredible in numbers, amounting to\r\nmany thousands—but few escape the watchful eyes of other insects and of\r\nbirds who feed upon them.\r\n\r\nBut there are some of the insecta which do not undergo metamorphosis;\r\nthe APTERA or wingless insects include these, as the flea and such\r\nparasites which bore into other animals, and deposit their eggs within\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 850.—Imago.]\r\n\r\nInsects have very little means for making themselves audible, at\r\nleast so far as can be ascertained. The humming of bees and flies and\r\nother insects are, of course, not intended to represent the voice.\r\nThe cricket’s “chirp,” as people commonly imagine, but the sound is\r\nattributable to the rubbing together of the wings or wing-cases, as is\r\nthe noise produced by the field-cricket. There is a very peculiar sound\r\nattributable to the “Death-Watch,” a ticking, and to nervous people\r\nterrible warning of dissolution. It may reassure some one, perhaps, to\r\nknow that this “unearthly sound” is caused simply by the insect beating\r\nits head against a piece of wood to attract its mate, as the female\r\nglow-worm lights her lamp to guide her lord to her bower.\r\n\r\nThe INSECTA may simply be divided into nine orders:—\r\n\r\n  1 COLEOPTERA.    Beetle tribe.                _Case-winged._\r\n  2 ORTHOPTERA.    Locusts, crickets, etc.      _Straight-winged._\r\n  3 NEUROPTERA.    Dragon-flies, etc.           _Nerve-winged._\r\n  4 HYMENOPTERA.   Bees, ants, wasps, etc.      _Membrane-winged._\r\n  5 STREPSIPTERA.  Parasites of the foregoing.  _Twisted-winged._\r\n  6 LEPIDOPTERA.   Moths and butterflies.       _Scale-winged._\r\n  7 HEMIPTERA.     Bugs, water-boatmen.         _Half-winged._\r\n  8 DIPTERA.       House-fly, gnat.             _Two-winged._\r\n  9 APRANIPTERA.   Fleas, “chigos.”             _Wingless._\r\n\r\n(Of these the metamorphoses of 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are complete).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 851.—The Stag-Beetle (_Lucanus cervus_).]\r\n\r\nThe COLEOPTERA are well represented in England as beetles. They have\r\nfour wings, but the outer pair serve as coverings to the inner ones.\r\nThey are termed _Elytra_, and are horny in texture. These beetles\r\nare short-lived, but useful as scavengers, and serve to manure the\r\nground by burying objectionable matter. The larvæ of beetles eat\r\ntremendously. The stag-beetle is a formidable-looking animal, and the\r\nlady-bird is well known as an enemy to the aphides on our rose trees.\r\nThe tiger-beetle, cockchafer, and various water-beetles belong to\r\nthis family. The scarabee, or sacred Egyptian beetle, also will be\r\nfound classed with the coleoptera. Many of these beetles are excellent\r\nscavengers, and some called burying beetles remove the soil underneath\r\nthe carcases of birds and other small dead animals, letting them fall\r\ndown below the ground level; the beetles then lay their eggs in the\r\nbody, so that sustenance may be at hand for the young when hatched.\r\n\r\nThe ORTHOPTERA include our cockroaches, miscalled “black beetles,” the\r\nlocusts, crickets, etc. The ravages of the locust are well known. The\r\nlarvæ of the orthoptera has no wings, but otherwise is very like the\r\ngrown insect. They change their skins frequently before they become\r\nperfect insects.\r\n\r\nPassing the “nerve-winged” dragon-flies and caddis, whose larvæ case\r\nis so familiar and useful as bait, we come to the very important and\r\ninteresting order of HYMENOPTERA, with four membranous wings. In\r\nthis rank we find bees, wasps, and ants, the first and last named\r\nbeing proverbial for industry and examples of almost superhuman\r\nreasoning powers, and a similitude to man’s arrangements in labour and\r\nhouse-building marvellous to contemplate. A study of the habits of\r\nants, bees, and wasps will reveal a state of society existing amongst\r\nthem which more nearly resembles man in feelings and habits, for these\r\ninsects possess means of oral communication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n Fig. 852.—Honey-lapping apparatus of wild sea-bee (_Halictus_), (_a_,\r\n magnified; _a_ _b_, more highly magnified).]\r\n\r\nAll these insects are armed with a sting, or other offensive weapon.\r\nThe ant possesses the “formic” acid, which derives its name from the\r\npossessor. The destructive white ants will eat away a wooden house very\r\nquickly, sapping and mining it in all directions till it is a mere\r\nskeleton. The habits of bees are so well known and have been so often\r\ndescribed that we need not detail them. The manner in which the ants\r\n“milk” the aphides is curious and interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 853.—Scales from moth’s wing (magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe STREPSIPTERA order includes very few species, so we may pass\r\nquickly to the LEPIDOPTERA, the butterflies and moths, whose beautiful\r\ncolourings and markings have attracted us all from childhood. There\r\nare about 12,000 species of the lepidoptera, and they are divided\r\ninto “moths” and “butterflies,” the former being seen in twilight, or\r\ndarkness, the latter in sunlight. They can readily be distinguished\r\nby the antennæ, those of the butterfly being tipped, or knobbed.\r\nThe silkworm belongs to this family. These insects undergo complete\r\nmetamorphosis. The remaining two orders of insects include the\r\nhouse-flies and gnats; and the flea, and jigger, or chigo, which\r\npenetrates the skin and lays its eggs in the flesh, causing thereby\r\ndangerous inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\nThis class includes a number of familiar animals such as the barnacle,\r\nthe crab, the lobster, shrimp, etc.; and curious as it may appear\r\nare closely related to our spiders. Their cases or coverings are all\r\narticulated or disposed in distinct segments. They breathe through\r\ngills or by tubes, and possess legs, or appendages for walking, eating,\r\nor guidance. They are generally marine creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 854.—Crustacea. 1. Lobster (_Astacus marinus_);\r\n2. Cray-fish (_Astacus fluviatilis_); 3. Crab (_Cancer pagurus_); 4.\r\nShrimp (_Crangon vulgaris_); 5. Prawn (_Palæmon serratus_).]\r\n\r\nThe shell of the crustacea is composed largely of lime, and of course\r\nbecomes very hard in time. It is formed from the skin. The body, like\r\nthat of an insect, is composed of head, thorax, and abdomen, divided\r\ninto twenty-one segments, of which seven occupy the head, seven the\r\nthorax, and the remainder the abdomen. Twenty segments are furnished\r\nwith legs, or feelers, or claws—a pair to a segment. The lobster or\r\ncrayfish will give excellent examples of the anatomy of the _macrura_\r\nor lobster kind of crustacea. The heart is situated in the back.\r\n\r\nThe following table given by Professor Nicholson will explain the\r\n“segments and appendages” of the lobster:—\r\n\r\n          { 1st Segment, Eyes.\r\n          { 2nd   ”      Lesser antennæ\r\n          { 3rd   ”      Greater antennæ.\r\n    Head  { 4th   ”      Pair of biting jaws.\r\n          { 5th   ”      First pair of chewing jaws.\r\n          { 6th   ”      Second pair of chewing jaws.\r\n          { 7th   ”      First pair of foot jaws.\r\n\r\n          { 8th   ”      Second pair of foot jaws.\r\n          { 9th   ”      Third pair of foot jaws.\r\n          {10th   ”      First pair of legs (claws).\r\n   Thorax {11th   ”      Second pair of legs (small claws).\r\n          {12th   ”      Third pair of legs (small claws).\r\n          {13th   ”      Fourth pair of legs.\r\n          {14th   ”      Fifth pair of legs.\r\n\r\n          {15th   ”      Ground appendages.\r\n          {16th   ”      Swimmerets.\r\n          {17th   ”         ”\r\n  Abdomen {18th   ”         ”\r\n          {19th   ”         ”\r\n          {20th   ”      Large swimmerets.\r\n          {21st   ”      No appendages (tail fin).\r\n\r\nThe tail is, as may be supposed, the great aid to locomotion in the\r\nlobster family, and they can swim backwards with great rapidity by its\r\nassistance. Lobsters shed their claws when alarmed, and are easily\r\ncaught by a glittering bait.\r\n\r\nThe hermit crabs are interesting creatures, but do not possess the\r\nhorny coat of the crab or lobster. They are therefore compelled to\r\ninhabit an empty shell, into which they thrust themselves, holding to\r\nthe bottom of it by their tail, while a large claw guards the entrance.\r\nWhen the animal gets too big for his house he moves to another, leaving\r\nthe old home for another hermit of the shore.\r\n\r\nThe crabs have no developed tails, and are therefore called\r\nbrachyura—“short-tailed,” and they are walking creatures. There are\r\nking crabs, land crabs, and the common swimming crab. These animals can\r\nshed their shells as other crustaceans, and a curious fact is they shed\r\nthem whole. How the claws come out must remain more or less a mystery.\r\nRéaumur investigated the action of the crayfish, and noticed that as\r\nthe casting time approached the crustacea retired to some hiding-place\r\nand remained without eating. The shell becomes gradually loosened, and\r\nat last by putting its feet against a stone and pushing backwards the\r\nanimal jerks himself away. It must be a painful operation, for the\r\nmill-like teeth of the stomach are also rejected, and the joints do not\r\ngive way. After a while a new shell appears, and is cast in due time as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the crustacea are situated in front, and are composed\r\nlike the insects, or are simple, like spiders. They possess a sense\r\nof hearing evidently. The eggs of the lobster are carried by the\r\nfemale, and they are termed the “coral” in consequence of their red\r\nand beadlike appearance. Our space will not admit of our saying much\r\nmore concerning the interesting crustacea, though the barnacles, so\r\nwell known by sight by all dwellers at the sea, and called Cirripedia,\r\nwhich fix themselves to rocks and ships, deserve notice. The young are\r\ncapable of movement, and this fact was first discovered in 1830. It\r\nresembled a mussel, but when kept in sea-water it adhered to the vessel\r\nwhich retained it. The cirripedia are so called from the cirri or arms\r\nwhich they possess, and by which they are enabled to entangle or catch\r\ntheir food, as in a net. They hold themselves by a “foot stalk.” The\r\ngoose-mussel, or barnacle, is very common, but must not be confounded\r\nwith the limpet.\r\n\r\nDr. Baird gives the following description of them:—“The cirripeds\r\nare articulated animals contained within a hard covering composed of\r\nseveral pieces and consisting of calcified chitine. The body of the\r\nanimal is enclosed in a sac lined with the most delicate membrane of\r\nchitine, which in one group is prolonged into a peduncle and contains\r\nthe ova; the body is distinctly articulated and placed with the back\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA—SPIDERS.\r\n\r\nThere are many families of arachnida besides the well-known garden\r\nand house spiders. The sea spiders, though classed with the arachnida,\r\nare sometimes placed amongst the crustacea. We have the “tick” and\r\nthe cheese-mite and the scorpions; all of which belong to the spider\r\nfamily. But the true spiders are known by the joining of the two\r\nupper segments, the thorax and head being united (cephalo-thorax).\r\nThe pretty and marvellous webs are spun from abdominal glands through\r\nsmall apertures. The fluid hardens in its passage sufficiently to be\r\nwoven into threads to resist the struggles of the captured prey. The\r\nforms of these webs vary, but some spiders do not catch their victims\r\nin the net; they pounce upon them cat fashion. The large house spider\r\nis well known to all. The garden spider is seen in the illustration\r\n(fig. 855) with the scorpion. The habits of spiders will be found a\r\nvery interesting study, and many volumes have been devoted to them. The\r\nwater spider is a frequent inmate of an aquarium, and the bubble of air\r\nhe takes down with him to breathe serves as a means of living while he\r\nis seeking his aquatic prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 855.—Arachnida. 1. Spider (_Epeira diadema_); 2.\r\nScorpion (_Scorpio_).]\r\n\r\nWe will close our rapid survey of the invertebrate animals with a\r\nglance at the MOLLUSCA, which are divided into six classes (_see_ page\r\n703). The first is the Tunicata, which have no shell or hard covering,\r\nand come under the denomination of molluscoids, and belong to a lower\r\norder. The true mollusca include the Brachiopoda, which have a pair\r\nof shells. They are called “arm-footed” because a long cord or tendon\r\npasses through one of the shells, and fixes the mollusc to the rock.\r\nThe Lingula of this class have been discovered in very old formations\r\nsuch as the Devonian period, and indeed appear to have been amongst the\r\nfirst created animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 856.—Mollusca. 1. Nautilus (_Argonauta_); 2. Clio\r\nBorealis; 3. Mussel (_Mytilus edule_).]\r\n\r\nThe Lamellibranchiata include the oyster, cockle, mussel, etc. They are\r\nwell known, and scarcely need description. The Pteropoda have no shell.\r\nThe Gasteropoda are very numerous, and periwinkles, whelks, snails,\r\netc., belong to this class. They progress by a muscular “mantle,” which\r\nis extended and contracted. The “horns” have eyes at the extremities.\r\nWhen they retire into their “houses” they can close the door by a kind\r\nof lid called the “operculum.”\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopods include the nautilus and the cuttle fish, the terrible\r\nsquid, or octopus, etc. Wonderful tales are told of the tenacity and\r\nferocity of the “Poulpes,” and no doubt in long-past ages these animals\r\nattained a gigantic growth. They are very unpleasant enemies, and\r\nthe cold, slimy grasp of the long tentacles is apt to give one the\r\n“horrors,” while the terrible head and beak fill one with dismay. The\r\npoulpes are very formidable opponents, and discretion will certainly be\r\nthe better part of valour when they appear in our vicinity.\r\n\r\nWe must here close our sketch of the Invertebrates, and we regret\r\nthat the limits of our volume will not permit us to continue this\r\ninteresting subject, nor can we find space, at present, for even the\r\nbarest description of the Vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sun-fish (_Orthagoriscus_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ANALYSIS OF CHANCE AND MATHEMATICAL GAMES.\r\n\r\n MAGIC SQUARES—THE SIXTEEN PUZZLE—SOLITAIRE—EQUIVALENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to draw our readers’ attention to several\r\nexperiments very famous at a former period, but which our own\r\ngeneration has completely overlooked. We refer to the Analysis of\r\nChance, a science still known under the title of _Calculation of\r\nProbabilities_, formerly cultivated with so much ardour, but to-day\r\nalmost fallen into oblivion.\r\n\r\nOriginating in the caprice of the clever Chevalier de Méré, who in\r\n1654 suggested the game to Pascal, the analysis of chance has given\r\nrise to investigations of an entirely novel kind, and attempts have\r\nbeen made to measure the mathematical degree of credence to be given\r\nto simple conjectures. We will first recapitulate the principles laid\r\ndown by Laplace on this subject. We know that of a certain number of\r\nevents, one only can happen, but nothing leads us to the belief that\r\none will happen more than the other. The theory of chance consists in\r\nreducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of equally\r\npossible cases, such, that is to say, that we are equally undecided\r\nabout, and to determine the number of cases favourable to the event,\r\nwhose probability we are seeking. The ratio of this number to that of\r\nall possible cases is the measure of this probability, which is thus a\r\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of favourable cases, and\r\nthe denominator the number of all possible cases. When all the cases\r\nare favourable to an event, its probability changes to certainty, and\r\nit is then expressed by the unit. Probabilities increase or diminish\r\nby their mutual combination; if the events are independent of each\r\nother, the probability of the existence of their whole is the product\r\nof their particular probabilities. Thus the probability of throwing an\r\nace with one dice being 1/6, that of throwing two aces with two dice is\r\n1/36. Each of the sides of one dice combining with the six sides of the\r\nother, there are thirty-six possible cases, among which one only gives\r\nthe two aces. When two events depend on each other, the probability\r\nof the double event is the product of the probability of the first\r\nevent by the probability that, that event having occurred, the other\r\nwill occur. This rule helps us to study the influence of past events\r\non the probability of future events. If we calculate _á priori_ the\r\nprobability of the event that has occurred and an event composed of\r\nthis and another expected event, the second probability divided by the\r\nfirst, will be the probability of the expected event, inferred from the\r\nobserved event.\r\n\r\nThe probability of events serves to determine the hope or fear of\r\npersons interested in their existence. The word _hope_ here expresses\r\nthe advantage which someone expects in suppositions which are only\r\nprobable. This advantage in the theory of chances is the product\r\nof the hoped-for sum by the probability of obtaining it; it is the\r\npartial sum which should arise when one does not wish to run the\r\nrisks of the event, supposing that the apportionment corresponds\r\nto the probabilities. This apportionment is only equitable when we\r\nabstract from it all foreign circumstances; because an equal degree of\r\nprobability gives an equal title to the hoped-for sum. This advantage\r\nis called _mathematical hope_. Nevertheless, the rigorous application\r\nof this principle may lead to an inadmissible consequence. Let us see\r\nwhat Laplace says. Paul plays at heads and tails, on the understanding\r\nthat he receives two shillings if he succeeds at the first throw,\r\nfour shillings if he succeeds at the second, eight at the third, and\r\nso on. His stake on the game, according to calculation, must be equal\r\nto the number of throws; so that if the game continues indefinitely,\r\nthe stake also continues indefinitely. Yet, no reasonable man would\r\nventure on this game even a moderate sum, £2 for example. Whence,\r\ntherefore, comes this difference between the result of the calculation,\r\nand the indication of common-sense? We soon perceive that it proceeds\r\nfrom the fact, that the moral advantage which a benefit procures for\r\nus is not proportional to this advantage, and that it depends on a\r\nthousand circumstances, often very difficult to define, but the chief\r\nand most important of which is chance. In fact, it is evident that a\r\nshilling has much greater value for one who has but a hundred than\r\nfor a millionaire. We must, therefore, distinguish in the hoped-for\r\ngood between its absolute and its relative value; the latter regulates\r\nitself according to the motives which cause it to be desired, while\r\nthe former is independent. In the absence of a general principle\r\nto appreciate this relative value, we give a suggestion of Daniel\r\nBernouilli which has been generally admitted.\r\n\r\nThe relative value of an extremely small sum is equal to its absolute\r\nvalue, divided by the total advantage of the interested person. On\r\napplying the calculus to this principle, it will be found that the\r\n_moral hope_, the growth of chance due to expectations, coincides with\r\nthe mathematical hope, when chance, considered as a unit, becomes\r\ninfinite in proportion to the variations it receives from expectations.\r\nBut when these variations are a sensible portion of the unit, the\r\ntwo hopes may differ very greatly from each other. In the example\r\ncited, this rule leads to results conformable to the indications of\r\ncommon-sense. We find, in point of fact, that if Paul’s fortune amounts\r\nonly to £8, he cannot reasonably stake more than 7_s._ on the game.\r\nAt the most equal game, the loss is always, relatively greater than\r\nthe gain. Supposing, for example, that a person possessing a sum of\r\n£4, stakes £2 on a game of heads or tails, his money after placing\r\nhis stake will be _morally_ reduced to £3 11_s._ 0_d._—that is to\r\nsay, _this latter sum will procure him the same moral advantage as\r\nthe condition of his funds after his stake_. Whence we draw this\r\nconclusion: that the game is disadvantageous, even in the cases\r\nwhere the stake is equal to the product of the sum hoped for by the\r\nprobability. We may, therefore, form an idea of the immorality of games\r\nin which the hoped-for sum is below this product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 857.—The game of the needle.]\r\n\r\nJacques Bernouilli has thus laid down the result of his investigations\r\non the calculation of probabilities. An urn containing white and\r\nblack balls is placed in front of the spectator, who draws out a\r\nball, ascertaining its colour, and puts it back in the urn. After a\r\nsufficient number of draws, the total number of _extracted_ balls\r\ndivided by the total number of balls represents a fraction very near\r\nto that which has for a numerator the real number of white balls\r\nexisting in the urn, and for the denominator the total number of balls.\r\nIn other words, the ratios of the number either of extracted white\r\nballs, or the whole of the white balls to the total number, tend to\r\nbecome equal; that is, the probability derived from this experiment\r\napproaches indefinitely towards a certainty. The two fractions may\r\ndiffer from each other as little as possible, if we increase the number\r\nof draws. From this theorem we deduce several consequences.\r\n\r\n1. The relations of natural effects are nearly constant when these\r\neffects are considered in a great number.\r\n\r\n2. In a series of events indefinitely prolonged, the action of regular\r\nand constant causes affects that of irregular causes.\r\n\r\n_Applications._—The combinations presented by these games have been the\r\nsubject of former researches regarding probabilities. We will complete\r\nour exposition with two more examples.\r\n\r\nTwo persons, A and B, of equal skill, play together on the\r\nunderstanding that whichever beats the other a certain number of\r\ntimes, shall be considered to have won the game, and shall carry off\r\nthe stakes. After several throws the players agree to give up without\r\nfinishing the game; and the point then to be settled, is in what manner\r\nthe money is to be divided between them. This was one of the problems\r\nlaid before Pascal by the Chevalier de Méré. The shares of the two\r\nplayers should be proportional to their respective probabilities of\r\nwinning the game. These probabilities depend on the number of points\r\nwhich each player requires to reach the given number. A’s probabilities\r\nare determined by starting with the smallest numbers, and observing\r\nthat the probability equals the unit, when player A does not lose a\r\npoint. Thus, supposing A loses but one point, his chance is 1·2, 3·4,\r\n7·8, etc., according as B misses one, two, or three points. Supposing A\r\nhas missed two points, it will be found that his chance is as 1·4, 1·2,\r\n11·6, etc., according as B has missed one, two, or three points, etc.\r\nOr we may suppose that A misses three points, and so on.\r\n\r\nWe should note, _en passant_, that this solution has been modified\r\nby Daniel Bernouilli, by the consideration of the respective fortune\r\nof the players, from which he deduces the idea of moral hope. This\r\nsolution, famous in the history of science, bears the name of the\r\n_Petersburgh problem_, because it was made known for the first time in\r\nthe “Memoires de l’Académie de Russie.”\r\n\r\nWe will now describe the _game of the needle_. It is a genuine\r\nmathematical amusement, and its results, indicated by theory, are\r\ncertainly calculated to excite astonishment. The game of the needle is\r\nan application of the different principles we have laid down.\r\n\r\nIf we trace on a sheet of paper a series of parallel and equi-distant\r\nlines, AA1, BB1, CC1, DD1, and throw down on the paper at hazard a\r\nperfectly cylindrical needle, _a b_, the length of which equals half\r\nthe distance between the parallel lines (figs. 858 and 859), we\r\nshall discover this curious result. If we throw down the needle a\r\nhundred times, it will come in contact with one of the parallel lines\r\na certain number of times. Dividing the number of attempts with the\r\nnumber of successful throws, we obtain as a quotient a number which\r\napproaches nearer the value of the ratio between the circumference\r\nand the diameter in proportion as we multiply the number of attempts.\r\nThis ratio, according to the rules of geometry, is a fixed number,\r\nthe numerical value of which is 3·1415926. After a hundred throws\r\nwe generally find the exact value up to the two first figures: 3·1.\r\nHow can this unexpected result be explained? The application of the\r\ncalculus of probabilities gives the reason of it. The ratio between\r\nthe successful throws and the number of attempts, is the probability\r\nof this successful throw. The calculation endeavours to estimate this\r\nprobability by enumerating the possible cases and the favourable\r\nevents. The enumeration of possible cases exacts the application of\r\nthe principle of compound probabilities. It will be easily seen that\r\nit suffices to consider the chances of the needle falling between two\r\nparallel lines, AA1 and BB1 (fig. 858), and then to consider what\r\noccurs in the interval, _m n_, equal to the equi-distance. To obtain a\r\nsuccessful throw, it is necessary then:—\r\n\r\n1. That the middle of the needle should fall between _m_ and _l_,\r\nthe centre of _m o_. 2. That the angle of the needle with _m o_ will\r\nbe smaller than the angle, _m c b_. The calculation of all these\r\nprobabilities and their combination by multiplication, according to\r\nthe rules of compound probabilities, gives as the final expression of\r\nprobability the number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 858.—The needle game.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 859.—The needle game.]\r\n\r\nThis curious example justifies the theorem of Bernouilli relating to\r\nthe multiplication of events; there is no limit to the approximation\r\nof the result, when the attempts are sufficiently prolonged. When the\r\nlength of the needle is not exactly half the distance between the\r\nparallel lines, the practical rule of the game is as follows: The ratio\r\nbetween the number of throws and the number of successful attempts must\r\nbe multiplied by double the ratio between the length of the needle and\r\nthe distance between the parallel lines. In the case cited above, the\r\ndouble of the latter ratio equals the unit. We will give an application\r\nto this. A needle two inches long is thrown 10,000 times on a series of\r\nparallel lines, two-and-a-half inches apart; the number of successful\r\nthrows has been found to equal 5000. We take the ratio 1090/5009, and\r\nmultiply it by the ratio 1000/636 and the product is 3·1421. The true\r\nvalue is 3·1415. We have an approximation of 6/10000.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions indicated in this experiment are those which present in\r\na given number of attempts the most chances of obtaining the greatest\r\npossible approximation. We will conclude these remarks on games by some\r\nobservations borrowed from Laplace.\r\n\r\nThe mind has its illusions like the sense of sight; and just as the\r\nsense of touch corrects the latter, reflection and calculation correct\r\nthe former. The probability founded on an every-day experience, or\r\nexaggerated by fear or hope, strikes us as a superior probability, but\r\nis only a simple result of calculation.\r\n\r\nIn a long series of events of the same kind, the mere chances of\r\naccident sometimes offer these curious veins of good or bad fortune,\r\nwhich many persons do not hesitate to attribute to a kind of fatality.\r\nIt often happens in games which depend both on chance and the\r\ncleverness of the players, that he who loses, overwhelmed with his want\r\nof success, seeks to repair the evil by rash playing, which he would\r\navoid on another occasion; he thus aggravates his own misfortune and\r\nprolongs it. It is then, however, that prudence becomes necessary, and\r\nthat it is desirable to remember that the moral disadvantage attaching\r\nto unfavourable chances is increased also by the misfortune itself.[41]\r\nMathematical games, formerly so much studied, have recently obtained a\r\nnew addition in the form of an interesting game, known as the “Boss”\r\npuzzle. It has been introduced from America, and consists of a square\r\nbox, in which are placed sixteen small wooden dice, each bearing a\r\nnumber (fig. 860). No. 16 is taken away, and the others are placed\r\nhaphazard in the box, as shown in fig. 861. The point is then to move\r\nthe dice, one by one, into different positions, so that they are at\r\nlast arranged in their natural order, from one to fifteen; and this\r\nmust be accomplished by slipping them from square to square without\r\nlifting them from the box. If the sixteenth dice is added, the game\r\nmay be varied, and we may seek another solution of the problem, by\r\narranging the numbers so that the sum of the horizontal, vertical, and\r\ndiagonal lines gives the number 34. In this form the puzzle is one of\r\nthe oldest known. It dates from the time of the primitive Egyptians,\r\nand has often been investigated during the last few centuries,\r\nbelonging, as it does, to the category of famous _magic squares_, the\r\nprinciples of which we will describe. The following is the definition\r\ngiven by Ozanam, of the Academy of Sciences, at Paris, at the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century. The term _magic square_ is given to a square\r\ndivided by several small equal or broken squares, containing terms of\r\nprogression which are placed in such a manner that all those of one\r\nrow, either across, from top to bottom, or diagonally, make one and the\r\nsame sum when they are added, or give the same product when multiplied.\r\nIt is therefore evident from this definition, that there are two kinds\r\nof magic squares, some formed by terms of arithmetical progression,\r\nothers by terms of geometrical progression. We must also distinguish\r\nthe equal from the unequal magic squares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 860.—The sixteen puzzle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 861.—The numbers placed at hazard, and No. 16\r\nremoved.]\r\n\r\nWe give here several examples of magic squares with terms of\r\nmathematical progression, among them the square of 34, giving one of\r\nthe solutions to the puzzle just described (fig. 862). We also give an\r\nexample of a magic square composed of terms of geometrical progression.\r\nThe double progression for examples 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,\r\nas here arranged (fig. 863), forms such a square that the product\r\nobtained by multiplying the three terms of one row, or one diagonal,\r\nis 4,096, which is the cube of the mean term 16. The squares have been\r\ntermed _magic_, because, according to Ozanam, they were held in great\r\nveneration by the Pythagoreans. In the time of alchemy and astrology,\r\ncertain magic squares were dedicated to the seven planets, and engraved\r\non a metal blade which sympathized with the planet. To give an idea of\r\nthe combinations to which the study of magic squares lends itself, it\r\nis sufficient to add that mathematicians have written whole treatises\r\non the subject. Frénicle de Bessy, one of the most eminent calculators\r\nof the seventeenth century, consecrated a part of his life to the study\r\nof magic squares. He discovered new rules, and found out the means of\r\nvarying them in a multitude of ways. Thus for the magic square, the\r\nroot of which is 4, only sixteen different arrangements were known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 862.—Examples of magic squares formed by terms of\r\narithmetical progression.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 863.—Magic square formed by terms of geometrical\r\nprogression.]\r\n\r\nFrénicle de Bessy found 880 new solutions. An important work from the\r\npen of this learned mathematician has been published under the title of\r\n“Carrés ou Tables Magiques,” in the “Memoirs de l’Académie Royale des\r\nSciences,” from 1666-1699, vol. v. Amateurs, therefore, who are accused\r\nof occupying themselves with a useless game, unworthy the attention of\r\nserious minds, will do well to bear in mind the works of Frénicle, and\r\nbetter still, to consult them.\r\n\r\nWe have so far considered only the first part of the puzzle. We may\r\nnow examine the problem to which specially it has given rise. We are\r\nquite in accord with M. Piarron de Mondesir, who has been so good as to\r\nenlighten us upon the subject, which is really much more difficult than\r\nit appears.\r\n\r\nA French paper once proposed to give a prize of 500 francs to any\r\nindividual who would solve the following problem:—\r\n\r\nThrow the numbers out of the box, replace them at hazard, then in\r\narranging them place them in the following order (A fig. 864).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 864.—The Sixteen Puzzle.]\r\n\r\nNow nobody solved this problem, because in nine cases out of ten it is\r\nimpossible to do so. The first twelve numbers will come correctly into\r\ntheir places, and even 13 can be put in its place without much trouble;\r\nbut, instead of getting the last row right we shall find it will come\r\nout like B, viz., 14, 15, 13, in the large majority of instances. So\r\nany case can be solved in one of the two results given above, and we\r\ncan tell in advance, without displacing a number, in which way the\r\npuzzle will eventuate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 865.—Example 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 866.—Example 2.]\r\n\r\nLet us give this problem our attention for a few minutes, and we shall\r\nnot find it difficult.\r\n\r\nTake the first example. We will throw the cubes out of the box and put\r\nthem back in the order shown in fig. 865.\r\n\r\nWe see now that 1 occupies the place of 11, 11 that of 7, 7 that of 8,\r\n8 that of 6, 6 of 15, 15 of 1. This much is evident without any study.\r\nWe formulate these figures as follows, beginning with 1 and working\r\nfrom figure to figure till we are led to 1 again, and so on.\r\n\r\n  _1st. Series._—1, 11, 7, 8, 6, 15, 1  (6) even.\r\n\r\nCounting the number of different cubes we have 6; and we put (6) in a\r\nparenthesis. We call the first series even because 6 is an even number.\r\n\r\nWe now establish, by the same formula, a second series commencing with\r\n2, _and going back to it_, thus—\r\n\r\n  _2nd Series._—2, 4, 2                 (2) even.\r\n  _3rd Series._—3, 5, 10, 12, 3         (4) even.\r\n  _4th Series._—9, 13, 14, 9            (3) uneven.\r\n\r\nWe have now four series, the total number of points equal 15, as there\r\nought to be, for one cube is absent.\r\n\r\nLet us now take another example (_see_ fig. 866), and by working as\r\nbefore we have four series again, viz:—\r\n\r\n  _1st Series._—1, 7, 1                 (2) even.\r\n  _2nd Series._—2, 11, 3, 8, 4, 15, 2   (6) even.\r\n  _3rd Series._—5, 12, 13, 5            (3) uneven.\r\n  _4th Series._—9, 14, 10, 9            (3) uneven.\r\n\r\nThis gives us only 14 as a total, because 6 has not been touched at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now for the rule, so that we may be able to ascertain in advance,\r\nwhen we have established our series, whether we shall find our puzzle\r\nright or wrong at the end. We must put aside all unplaced numbers and\r\ntake no notice of uneven series. Only the even series must be regarded.\r\n\r\nThus if we do not find 1, or if we find 2, 4, or 6, the problem will\r\ncome into A as a result. If we find 1, 3, 5, or 7, the case will\r\neventuate as in B (fig. 864). Let us apply the rule to the problems we\r\nhave worked, and then the reason will be apparent.\r\n\r\nIn the first we find _three even series_; the problem will then end as\r\nin B diagram (fig. 864), for the number of _like_ series is _odd_.\r\n\r\nIn the second we find _two even series_ (pairs); we shall find our\r\nproblem work out as in diagram A (fig. 864), for the number of _like\r\nseries_ is _even_, one pair in each.\r\n\r\nWe are now in possession of a simple rule, both rapid and infallible,\r\nand which will save considerable trouble, as we can always tell\r\nbeforehand how our puzzle will come out. Any one can test the\r\npracticability of the rules for himself, but we may warn the reader\r\nthat he will never be able to verify every possible instance, for the\r\npossible cases are represented by the following sum—\r\n\r\n  2×3×4×5×6×7×8×9×10×11×12×13×14×15.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, 1,307,674,368,000 in all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLITAIRE.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat ancient amusement is well known, and the apparatus\r\nconsists of a board with holes to receive pegs or cups to receive the\r\nballs, as in the illustrations (figs. 867 and 870.) The usual solitaire\r\nboard contains thirty-seven pegs or balls, but thirty-three can also be\r\nplayed very well. Many scientific people have made quite a study of the\r\ngame, and have published papers on the subject. M. Piarron de Mondesir\r\nhas given two rules which will prove interesting.\r\n\r\nThe first is called that of equivalents, and supposes the game to be\r\nplayed out to a conclusion; the second, called the ring-game, admits of\r\na calculation being made so that the prospects of success can be gauged\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nThe method of play is familiar, so we need not detail it. It is simply\r\n“taking” the balls by passing over them in a straight line. The method\r\nof “equivalents” consists in replacing one ball with two others, as we\r\nwill proceed to explain by the diagram (fig. 868).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 867.—Solitaire.]\r\n\r\nSuppose we try the 33 game, which consists in filling every hole with\r\nthe exception of the centre one, and in “taking” all the balls, leaving\r\none solitary in the centre at the last. Suppose an inexperienced player\r\narrives at an impossible solution of five balls in 4, 11, 15, 28, and\r\n30.\r\n\r\nTo render the problem soluble, and to win his game, I will replace No.\r\n11 by two equivalents, 9 and 10, the ball 28 by two others, 23 and 16,\r\nand the ball 30 by 25 and 18. These substitutions will not change the\r\n“taking off,” for I can take 10 with 9, 23 with 16, and 25 with 18. But\r\nby so doing I substitute for an irreducible solution of five balls a\r\nnew system of eight (those shown with the line drawn through them in\r\nthe diagram), which can easily be reduced to the desired conclusion,\r\nand the game will be achieved.\r\n\r\nThere are in reality three terminations possible to the problem—the\r\nsingle ball, the _couple_, and the _tierce_; that is, you may have only\r\none left, or two placed diagonally, such as 9-17, 25-29, or a system of\r\nthree in a straight line, 9-16-23. By the “equivalents” you can always\r\nsucceed in solving the problem desired.\r\n\r\nWe will now point out four transformations which are very easy to\r\neffect, and result from the rule of “equivalents.”\r\n\r\n1. Replacement of the two balls, situated on the same line and\r\nseparated by an empty cup, by one put into that cup. Thus I can replace\r\n23 and 25 by a single ball at 24.\r\n\r\n2. Suppression of tierces. And by the above movement I suppress the\r\ntierce 9-16-23.\r\n\r\n3. Correspondent “cases” are two holes situated in the same line and\r\nseparated by two cups. If two corresponding cups are filled, I can\r\nsuppress the balls which occupy them. So I can put aside 4 and 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 868.—Correspondents and equivalents.]\r\n\r\n4. It is permissible to move a ball into one of the correspondent cups\r\nif it be vacant; thus I can put 10 into 29.\r\n\r\nThese are the four transformations which can be made evident with the\r\nrings, without displacing the balls. To do this we need have only seven\r\nrings large enough to pass over the balls and to surround the holes in\r\nwhich they rest. Let us take an example.\r\n\r\n_Solitaire_ with 33 holes (fig. 869). _Final solution of the single\r\nball._\r\n\r\n1st Vertical row: 7 and 21 are occupied, and the intermediate hole 14,\r\nbeing empty, I place a ring upon 14.\r\n\r\n2nd Vertical row: No. 8 takes 15, and comes into 22; I place a ring on\r\n22.\r\n\r\n3rd Vertical row: I suppress the corresponding balls, 4-23 and 16-31,\r\nthere now only remains 9, so I place a ring on 9.\r\n\r\n4th Vertical row: I suppress the correspondents 10-29, put 2 into 17,\r\nand I place a ring upon 17.\r\n\r\n5th Vertical row: I suppress correspondents 6-25, put 33 into 18, and I\r\nplace a ring upon 18.\r\n\r\n6th Vertical row: No. 12 takes 19 and comes to 26; I place a ring on 26.\r\n\r\n7th Vertical row: No. 20 is the only ball; I place a ring on 20.\r\n\r\n(It must be understood that these operations should be proceeded with\r\nmentally; the balls must not be disturbed.)\r\n\r\nWe have thus reduced the problem to seven ringed balls, which are 14,\r\n22, 9, 17, 18, 26, and 20 which are indicated on the diagram by the\r\nline drawn through each vertically. They are all comprised in the three\r\nhorizontal rows, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 869.—Single ball solution.]\r\n\r\nWe can now set to work upon these three rows in the same manner as\r\nbefore, considering the rings as balls.\r\n\r\n3rd row: We find (and leave) a ring upon 9.\r\n\r\n4th row: The two corresponding rings, 17-20, neutralize each other, and\r\nwe suppress them. We carry 14 to 17, and take 17 with 18, which comes\r\ninto 16. We leave a ring on 16.\r\n\r\n5th row: Carry the ring 26 to 23, take 23 with 22, which comes thus to\r\n24, and we leave a ring on 24.\r\n\r\nWe now have reduced our problem to three rings, 9, 16, and 24, all in\r\nthe central square, indicated in the diagram by horizontal bars. It is\r\neasy to see that 9 will take 16 and 24 and come into 25, and 25 will\r\nremain alone—as was intended to be done—a single ball upon the board,\r\nindicated by the circle around it in the cut.\r\n\r\nBy playing the “equivalent” method you will always arrive at this\r\nresult—a single ball in No. 25. It may now be perceived how we cannot\r\nonly arrive at a satisfactory solution, but by means of the rings\r\nascertain whether we shall succeed in our game without disturbing a\r\nsingle ball. After some experience we may even learn to dispense with\r\nthe rings altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 870.—Solitaire board.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] From “La Nature.” Notice of M. Ch. Boutemps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n THE MAGIC TOP—THE GYROSCOPE AND SCIENTIFIC GAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not do our readers the injustice to suppose that they are not\r\nfamiliar with the ordinary top,—the delight of all school-boys and\r\nyoung people,—of which, therefore, we forbear giving any description;\r\nbut we now desire to give some details of the construction of the\r\nwonderful magic top. It is composed of a large disc, with an axis\r\nturning on two pivots connected with a circle of iron. When in repose,\r\nthis plaything exhibits nothing of a remarkable character; it is\r\ncompletely inert, obeying, like all other bodies, the laws of gravity.\r\nBut when we come to give the disc a movement of rapid rotation, this\r\ninert instrument seems to assume a vitality of its own if we attempt to\r\nmove it; it resists, and seems to thrust back the hand, and executes\r\nmovements even in a contrary direction. Besides this, it appears to\r\nbe freed, in a certain measure, from the laws of gravity; if we place\r\nit on its pivot, instead of falling, as it would when the disc is\r\nmotionless, it preserves the upright or inclined position in which\r\nwe place it, the upper extremity of the axis slowly describing a\r\nhorizontal circle round the fulcrum of the other extremity.\r\n\r\nFew persons are sufficiently familiar with the theory of mechanics\r\nto understand these phenomena, and it often happens that such a top\r\npurchased to amuse a child becomes an object of wonder and interest\r\nto his seniors. We do not pretend here to explain mathematically the\r\nreason of the facts before us, but the mechanical principle on which\r\nthis top is constructed is of such great scientific importance, that\r\nwe will, in a few words, explain it to our readers. It is sufficient\r\nto have a little knowledge of mechanics to be aware that a body in\r\nmotion, subjected to the action of a force tending to give it a\r\ndirectly contrary motion, will follow a movement in a third direction,\r\nwhich is termed the resultant of the two others; and this resultant\r\napproaches nearer to one of the original directions, in proportion as\r\nthe corresponding movement is more rapid in relation to the other.\r\nIf, for example, you strike a billiard ball, which is rolling past\r\nyou, in such a manner that you drive it regularly along in the same\r\ndirection, it appears only to obey a part of the given impulsion, and\r\ncontinues its course in an oblique direction, the speed with which it\r\ncommenced rolling combining with the impulsion to produce a resultant\r\nmovement. If it is rolling very quickly, and you strike it gently, it\r\nwill scarcely turn out of its course. If, on the contrary, it is moving\r\nslowly, and receives a violent shock, it will run off almost exactly in\r\nthe direction in which it has been struck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 871.—The magic top.]\r\n\r\nNow that which occurs in this example of a body tending to two\r\nmovements at the same time, is also produced when it is a question of\r\nmovements of rotation, so that if a force acts upon a body in rotation\r\nin such a manner as to give it a movement of the same kind round\r\nanother axis, a third movement will be originated round a third axis,\r\nthe direction of which will be nearest to that in which the rotation\r\nis most rapid. Let us apply this very simple principle to our top,\r\nand we shall see that magic has nothing whatever to do with these\r\nmovements, which at first glance appears so extraordinary. Having\r\nset it in motion, we rest it on its pivot, its axis in a horizontal\r\nposition; we then find that we have two movements before us; first,\r\nthat which we gave the top ourselves, and secondly, the movement of\r\nrotation which occurs round a second axis equally horizontal passing\r\nthrough the fulcrum and perpendicular line to the first. A movement of\r\nrotation therefore originates round a third axis placed between the\r\ntwo first, but whilst the real axis of the top, obeying this resultant\r\nmovement, takes up its new position, the law of gravity continuing to\r\nact, displaces and moves it a little further, so that in endeavouring\r\nto reach its centre of gravity, it turns round its fulcrum (fig. 871).\r\nFrom this explanation, it will be easily seen that the more rapid the\r\nmovement given to the top,—that due to gravity remaining constant,—the\r\nnearer will be the axis of the resultant movement to its real axis,\r\nand consequently the slower will be the movement of rotation of the\r\nwhole round the pivot. Thus this apparently incomprehensible phenomenon\r\nis easily explained by gravity, vertical force producing a movement\r\nof rotation in a horizontal plane. One can also explain by analogous\r\nreasoning, and calculation of passive resistance, why the axis of\r\nthe top gradually inclines in proportion as the speed of the latter\r\ndiminishes, and the speed of rotation round the fulcrum increases; why\r\nit falls immediately if an obstacle is opposed to the latter movement,\r\nand finally, why it produces on the hand which holds it, movements\r\nwhich astonish persons so intensely who behold it for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe principle we have just described is often enunciated, by saying\r\nthat every body in rapid rotation rests in its plane, and can only\r\nbe driven out by a considerable force; this, however, is a defective\r\nformula. The principle should be stated in the following manner. A\r\nbody in rapid rotation tends to remain in its plane; that is, its\r\naxis rests parallel with itself, and instead of obeying any force\r\ntending to divert its direction, it produces in consequence of the\r\ncombination of two simultaneous movements, a displacement of the axis,\r\ngenerally much feebler and of a different kind from that which this\r\nforce exercises on the same body in repose. One of the most charming\r\napplications of this theory is due to M. Foucault. The _Gyroscope_,\r\nwhich bears his name, is a heavy disc, the axis of which is supported\r\nby a “_Cardan_” balance, so that, whatever is the position of the\r\ncontrivance, it is possible to preserve it in a constant direction.\r\nTherefore if the disc is, by means of special mechanism, put in rapid\r\nrotation, we may give it all kinds of possible displacement without\r\nchanging the plane in which the gyroscope moves. Supposing then that\r\nits connection with the suspension is fixed in a relatively immovable\r\nmanner, but attracted by a movement towards the ground, the plane of\r\nrotation of the disc will not entirely participate in this movement.\r\nIt is true, it will be carried into the movement of general removal,\r\nbut it will remain constantly parallel with itself, and only appears\r\ndisplaced in comparison with the surrounding objects, which obey more\r\ncompletely than itself the movement of the globe’s rotation round its\r\npoles. Thus can we demonstrate the movement of our planet. In virtue of\r\nthe same principle, we see every day passing before our eyes a crowd\r\nof phenomena with which we are so familiar that they do not excite our\r\nattention. Thus it is because the hoop tends to remain in its plane of\r\nrotation that it rolls on without falling or deviating, and for the\r\nsame reason that tops rotate vertically on their points, or when they\r\nare running down, describe a series of concentric circles; and for the\r\nsame reason again, a juggler is able so easily to hold on the point\r\nof a stick a plate which he puts in rapid rotation, etc. It is also\r\nowing to this property of rotating bodies that we have been enabled\r\nto make use of cylindrical or conical projectiles in artillery. The\r\ncoiled riflings of the cannon causing the projectiles to turn round\r\nvery rapidly, their axis preserves an invariable direction during\r\ntheir whole course, until they finally strike the object at which\r\nthey are aimed. Without this rotation they would pirouette in an\r\nirregular manner in the air, and besides any precision in firing being\r\nimpossible, the resistance of the air would diminish their range to an\r\nenormous extent.\r\n\r\nThe Gyroscope, an instrument now familiar to most scientific persons,\r\nis still a problem of which the solution has not yet been found. It\r\nmay be called the paradox of mechanics, for although it depends on\r\ngravitation, it appears to be entirely indifferent to it.\r\n\r\nAn American scientist has applied electricity to the gyroscope, so\r\nas to make its movements as continuous as possible, and to enable us\r\nto study it more at leisure and with better results. The gyroscope\r\nis mounted on a pedestal which tapers to a point, and supports the\r\ninstrument. The bar of the gyroscope on which the electro-magnets are\r\nfixed rests upon the top of the pedestal. One of the extremities of the\r\nbobbin is fixed to the cavity, when the bar and support join, the other\r\nextremity communicates with the bar which joins the nuts of the magnets.\r\n\r\nAn insulator of hardened caoutchouc is so placed that it just touches\r\nthe axis of the wheel twice in every revolution of that wheel. Its\r\nplane of rotation is at right angles to the magnets, and carries an\r\narmature of soft iron which turns very close to the magnet without\r\ntouching it. The armature is put _en rapport_ with the surface of\r\ncontact of the cylinder, so that when the armature approaches it is\r\nattracted; but immediately afterwards, as it reaches the opposite side,\r\nthe current is interrupted, and the impulse acquired is sufficient to\r\nmove the wheel to the spot where the armature can again come under the\r\ninfluence of the magnet.\r\n\r\nThe magnets, the wheel, and all the parts of the instrument together\r\ncan move around in any direction. When two or four Bunsen cells are\r\nput in connection with the gyroscope, the wheel turns with tremendous\r\nrapidity, and by permitting the magnets to work (an operation which\r\nrequires some little dexterity), the wheel not only sustains itself,\r\nbut also the magnets and the other subjects which are between it and\r\nthe extremity of the pedestal—in opposition to the laws of gravitation.\r\nThe wheel, besides turning rapidly around its axis; revolves slowly\r\naround the point of the column in the same direction taken by the lower\r\npart of the wheel.\r\n\r\nWhen attaching the arms and counter-poise of the machine, so that\r\nthe wheel and the magnets may balance themselves exactly on the\r\npointed pedestal, the machine remains stationary. But if we give any\r\npreponderance to the wheel and magnets the rotation of the apparatus\r\nis in a direction opposite to that which would result from turning the\r\nupper part of the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe gyroscope illustrates the persistence with which a body that\r\nsubmits to rotation maintains itself in the plane of its rotation,\r\nnotwithstanding the force of gravitation. It also shows the result of\r\nthe combined action of two forces tending to produce rotation around\r\ntwo separate axes, which are, however, situated in the same plane.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the wheel round its axis is produced in the present\r\ncase by the electro-magnet; and the tendency of the wheel to fall,\r\nor to turn in a vertical plane parallel to its axis, results in the\r\nrotation of the entire instrument upon a new axis, which coincides with\r\nthe pointed pedestal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN MONEY-BOX.\r\n\r\nDuring a recent visit to London, as I was one day walking in the\r\nCrystal Palace, my attention was attracted by a curious money-box,\r\nsurmounted by a pictorial representation of one of the London streets.\r\nThe carriages, horses, and pedestrians were represented by figures\r\ncut out of cardboard, arranged in a groove. A large placard bore this\r\ninscription: “_Notice to visitors: Throw a penny in the money-box; and\r\nthe figures will perform_.”\r\n\r\nI at once responded to this invitation, and immediately beheld the\r\nlittle _tableaux_ become moving and life-like; the cabs rolled along,\r\nand the passers-by walked up and down the street. A number of visitors\r\nfollowed my example, and there is no doubt the money-box was full at\r\nthe end of the day. This ingenious contrivance for obtaining money in\r\nso easy a manner, and without having recourse to a “show-man,” appeared\r\nto me worthy of investigation and description.\r\n\r\nThe _Scientific American_ (New York) has recently given an explanation\r\nof this curious contrivance, and we will here quote what has been\r\npublished on the subject.\r\n\r\n“Among the inventions intended to obtain contributions of money from\r\nthe visitors at the Philadelphia Exhibition,” says the American writer,\r\n“we will describe the singular money-boxes placed in the _salons_ of\r\nthe principal hotels and the galleries of the exhibition, etc. These\r\ncontrivances all consisted of a case or box, with a glass front,\r\nthrough which can be seen a landscape in miniature, with trees, houses,\r\nfigures, etc., all cut out of cardboard, and painted with great nicety.\r\nOn the box was a label requesting the visitor to drop a coin into it\r\nand await the result of the contribution. When the penny has fallen in\r\nit puts in motion some hidden machinery, and then we see the people in\r\nthe miniature landscape all in motion, riding or walking or hunting, as\r\nthe case may be.”\r\n\r\nAnother box is even more successful, for it places in the hands of\r\nthe contributor a photograph of some celebrated person. But to obtain\r\nthe photograph we must contribute six pennies. The _carte_ will not\r\ncome out if we do not put in the proper coins, and the apparatus is\r\nperfectly fair and honest.\r\n\r\nThe illustration, fig. 872, shows the apparatus, which is very\r\nsimple. On the left the ordinary box is seen, on the right there is a\r\nlongitudinal section of it.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the lower portion, where the money is received in, is\r\na hollow support, A, which sustains the box in which the photographs\r\nare placed upon an inclined plane, and resting against the glass.\r\nThe pieces of money, in falling, strike the extremity of a vertical\r\nbalance, which immediately turns a toothed wheel, C. This wheel has\r\nas many teeth as there are pieces of money necessary to purchase\r\nthe photograph or _carte de visite_. Upon the escapement wheel is a\r\nratchet arrangement, D, the shaft being moved by a cord rolled around\r\nit and attached to a spring, E. A bolt, F, moved by a spring, is kept\r\nconstantly pressed against the “snail,” D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 872.—American money-box.]\r\n\r\nThus at each revolution, as the parts of the machinery are animated\r\nby the same movement, the bolt is withdrawn sufficiently to permit a\r\n_carte_ to fall, and then the card next following will be ready resting\r\nupon the bolt. The photographs being placed upon an inclined plane, are\r\npushed forward by a movable frame, G, which has a roller at the base.\r\nSo as one card falls out another is immediately replaced close to the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked that the wheel has six teeth, so that as one piece of\r\nmoney dropped in moves it one-sixth of its revolution, six pieces will\r\nbe necessary to produce the card. Of course wheels can be made with one\r\nor more teeth, and the payment may be varied for valuable objects at\r\nthe desire of the possessor.\r\n\r\nThe invention is not only a plaything. It can be made useful in the\r\ndistribution of pamphlets, or newspapers, which can be introduced\r\ninto the box folded uniformly. They can also be used in omnibuses or\r\ntram-cars, and tickets may be given by the machine on payment of the\r\nproper sum of money.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter with an illustration of a spiral bottle,\r\nwhich can be done in the manner now to be described, so that the bottle\r\nwill actually become a glass spring.\r\n\r\nTake a mixture of 180 grammes of lampblack, 60 grammes of gum arabic,\r\n23 grammes of adraganth, and 23 grammes of benzoin. Make these\r\ningredients into a paste by the addition of water, and fashion a pencil\r\nof the charcoal thus obtained. This pencil, when heated, will cut the\r\nglass wherever it is applied.\r\n\r\nThe process is commenced by scraping the bottle with a file and\r\nfollowing the instrument with the red-hot pencil. Wherever the hot\r\npencil is applied, the glass will be cut as shown in the illustration\r\nherewith. It will be necessary to blow upon the heated pencil to\r\nmaintain the incandescence as long as possible. The bottle as cut and\r\nrepresentations of the instruments are given in the cut (fig. 873).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 873. Spiral bottle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC OBJECTS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 874.—Reading wheel desk.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century there was at Lyons a very\r\nremarkable mansion built by a man named Nicholas Grollier de Servière.\r\nThis house was filled with all the most remarkable curiosities and\r\ninventions of the period. The owner belonged to an ancient family. His\r\ngreat-uncle, Jean Grollier, had amassed a magnificent library, the\r\nbest in France. His father was also a celebrated adherent of Henry\r\nIV., and M. Servière himself had inherited much scientific taste and\r\nintelligence from his ancestors. His house was full of curiosities,\r\ningenious machines, and mysterious clocks, concerning some of which\r\nthings we shall have something to say in this chapter.\r\n\r\nM. de Servière’s ingenuity was first apparent in the circular reading\r\ndesk, or wheel-desk, on which he put all the books he was likely to\r\nrequire within a certain time. He seated himself by this revolving\r\ndesk, and then was enabled to read any book or paper he desired by\r\nmerely turning the wheel with his hands and thus bringing it under his\r\nvision. In these days it is equally possible to collect useful articles\r\neither of an electric nature or otherwise. We have already described\r\nthe electric pen and the writing machine, with some other things\r\nwhich might be included in our list of domestic appliances, but the\r\nChromograph has not been yet illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 875.—The chromograph.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHROMOGRAPH.\r\n\r\nWhen we have written with a certain well-known violet “ink” upon a\r\nsheet of paper and applied it to a soft gelatinous surface and rubbed\r\nit a few times, we shall obtain an impression of the writing on the\r\ngelatine. By pressing blank sheets of paper upon this we may pull off\r\nquite a number of copies of our letter or circular. This practice is\r\nnow so well known that it is scarcely necessary to detail it. The\r\nlayer of gelatine is made up as follows, and any of the recipes will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n1. Gelatine 100 grammes, water 375 grammes, glycerine 375 grammes,\r\nkaolin 50 grammes. (Lebaigueé.)\r\n\r\n2. Gelatine 100 grammes, dextrine 100 grammes, glycerine 1000 grammes,\r\nsulphate of baryta _q.s._ (W. Wartha.)\r\n\r\n3. Gelatine 100 grammes, glycerine 1,200 grammes, bouillie de sulphate\r\nde baryta, strained, 500 cubic centimètres. (W. Wartha.)\r\n\r\n4. Gelatine 1 gramme, glycerine à 30° 4 grammes, water 2 grammes.\r\n(Kwaysser and Husak.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 876.—The chromograph.]\r\n\r\nThe “mixture” is shaken until it cools to the point of thickening, and\r\nthen poured into a zinc vessel. The kaolin or the sulphate of baryta\r\nmakes the composition white. It can be treated again with gelatine\r\nand molasses employed for printing rollers. When the proofs have been\r\ntaken from the frame the surface may be rubbed with a damp sponge, and\r\nthen it will be ready for use again immediately. The introduction of\r\ndextrine facilitates the cleansing of the surface plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPYLOMETER.[42]\r\n\r\nThis instrument, constructed by Lieutenant Gaumet, is very easily\r\ncarried in the pocket, and by a very simple process gives (1) the\r\nlength of any line, straight or curved, traced on a map or plan; (2)\r\nthe actual length corresponding to a “graphical” length on maps of the\r\nscale of 1/80000 or 1/100000, or on maps which are multiples of these\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe instrument consists of a toothed disc, the circumference of which\r\nis dentated exactly in five centimètres. The faces of this disc each\r\ncarry a system of divisions; one is divided into four parts, the other\r\ninto five. The circumference of the disc (5 centimètres) corresponds to\r\nthe 4 kilomètres of the scale of 1/80000, and to 5 kilomètres of that\r\nof 1/100000. The division 1/40 of the disc in the former scale measures\r\n100 mètres, and is in it the same as 1/50 of the other scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 877.—The campylometer.]\r\n\r\nThe toothed disc moves upon a micro-metric screw, the markings of which\r\nare 0·0015 of a mètre, and a small “rule” or “reglet” carries equal\r\ngraduations, as the screw representing lengths so follow:—\r\n\r\n  1.  5, 10, 15, 20    50 _centi._     according to metric scale.\r\n  2.  5, 10, 15, 20    50 _kil._           scale 1/100000;\r\n  3.  4,  8, 12, 16    40 _kil._                 1/80000;\r\n\r\nThe micro-metric screw is fixed in a frame so made as to form a kind of\r\nindicator or guide at one side.\r\n\r\nTo make use of the campylometer, bring the zero of the disc opposite\r\nthe zero of the rule (reglet), then place the instrument on the map in\r\na perpendicular position; the point will serve as guide, and move the\r\ndisc upon the line, whether direct or sinuous, of which you wish to\r\nascertain the length.\r\n\r\nWhen this has been done, note the last graduation of the “reglet”\r\nbeyond which the disc has stopped, add to the value of this graduation\r\nthe complementary length shown by the division of the disc which is\r\nopposite the “reglet.” To find the length of a material line we must\r\nadd to the number of centimètres shown by the upper graduation the\r\ncomplement in millimètres furnished by the division to the 1/50th.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we read 20 upon the upper scale, 35 the division\r\nto the 1/50 opposite the “reglet”; the length obtained is 20\r\ncentimètres _plus_ 35 millimètres, or 0·235 mètres. If we are measuring\r\nupon a map on the 1/100000 scale, the upper graduations represent\r\nkilomètres, the complementary divisions on the 1/50 scale hundredths of\r\nmètres.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose again 20 be the superior graduation, 35 the\r\ndivision to the 1/50 of the disc as before; the distance measured is 20\r\nkilomètres _plus_ 3,500 mètres, or 23,500 mètres.\r\n\r\nOn the map the lower graduation of the “reglet” is used. For instance,\r\nif 12 be the upper graduation of the division to 1/40 of the distance\r\nopposite to the “reglet,” the distance measured will be 12,700 mètres.\r\n\r\nThe campylometer has been specially constructed for maps on the\r\n1/80000 and 1/100000 scales, and calculations can be made easily for\r\nany maps whose scales are multiples or sub-multiples of these. But\r\nthe instrument will serve equally well for all maps or plans of which\r\nthe numerical scale is known. We must multiply the length of the line\r\nexpressed in millimètres by the denominator of the scale divided by\r\n1,000.\r\n\r\nSo upon an English map to the 1/63360, a length of 155 millimètres\r\ncorresponds to a “natural” length of 63,360 multiplied by 155, or\r\n9820·80 mètres.\r\n\r\nThus we perceive that the employment of the campylometer does not\r\nnecessitate the tracing of a graphic scale, but only the knowledge of\r\nthe numerical scale. When the former only is known, the campylometer\r\nmay be used in the following manner:—\r\n\r\nHaving traced with the disc the line you wish to measure, carry the\r\ninstrument to the zero of the scale and let it run inversely the length\r\nof that scale, until the zero of the disc returns opposite to the zero\r\nof the “reglet.” The point at which the disc is stopped on the scale\r\nindicates the length of the line measured upon the map. If the scale be\r\nsmaller than the line measured, repeat the operation as many times as\r\nmay be necessary.\r\n\r\nIf it is desirable to ascertain upon a map of a scale of 1/20000 the\r\ndistance represented by 1,200 mètres, we have only to place the toothed\r\ndisc so that its position marks four times the required distance—that\r\nis, 4,800 mètres on the map of 1/80000 (for 4 times 20 = 80). Then move\r\nthe disc in the given direction until the zero returns opposite the\r\nzero of the “reglet”; this limit will mark the extremity of the length\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nExplanations are not easy upon paper, but the instrument is found\r\nvery easy in actual use. It is employed by the military staff for\r\ncalculating distances of any kind, curves or straight lines. On the\r\nmarch, or even on horseback, the campylometer can be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTERIOUS CLOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe clocks represented in the two following illustrations (figs. 878\r\nand 879), are well worthy of being placed in the house of any amateur\r\nof science. They are made of transparent crystal, and though all\r\nmechanism is cleverly concealed they keep capital time. The former\r\nclock (fig. 878) is the invention of Robert Houdin, and consists of two\r\ncrystal discs superposed and enclosed in the same frame. One carries\r\nthe usual numerals, the other moves upon its centre with the minute\r\nhand attached, and its rotation induces by the ordinary method the\r\nmovement of the hour hand. The requisite motion is transmitted to the\r\ndial by gear disposed along the circumference and hidden within the\r\nmetallic frame, and is itself put in motion by clockwork, enclosed in\r\nthe pedestal of the timepiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 878.—Houdin’s clock.]\r\n\r\nM. Cadot, in his clock (fig. 879), retains the plates, but adopts\r\nthe rectangular form, so as to preclude all idea of rotation, and to\r\npuzzle those who are acquainted with the working of Houdin’s clock.\r\nThe minute hand cannot, in this instance, be fixed to the second glass\r\nplate, it preserves its independence. This movable plate has only a\r\nvery slight angular movement around its centre, which oscillation or\r\n“play” is permitted in the interior of the rectangular dial. A little\r\nspring movement, hidden in the central nut of the “hand,” provides in\r\nprogressive rotation the oscillation of the transparent plate, which\r\ncannot be perceived to move.\r\n\r\nTo produce this “balance” motion the plate is supported upon a bar in\r\nthe lower part of the metal frame. After the direct oscillation of\r\nwhich we have spoken, a little spring puts the machinery back. The\r\ndirect displacement is produced by a vertical piston which raises the\r\nend of the bar. This piston rests upon a bent lever communicating with\r\na wheel with thirty triangular teeth. Finally this wheel turns upon\r\nits axis once in an hour by a clockwork arrangement in the pedestal of\r\nthe clock. Each tooth takes two minutes to pass, and the movement is\r\ncommunicated to the minute hand, which thus goes round the dial in the\r\nhour. The hour hand is controlled by a delicate arrangement hidden in\r\nthe base. The illustration and notes will explain the working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 879.—M. Cadot’s clock.]\r\n\r\nM. Henri Robert has also invented a very interesting clock, and one\r\ncalculated to excite much curiosity (fig. 881).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 880.—1. Front view. 2. Profile. 3. Detail of\r\nmovement between the glasses. 4. Detail of movable plate. _a._ Base of\r\nclock. _b._ Framework. _c._ Space for movement. _d._ Wheel support.\r\n_e._ Cogwheel.]\r\n\r\nWe can see nothing but a crystal dial, perfectly transparent, upon the\r\nsurface of which two “hands” move, as upon an ordinary clock face.\r\nThere is no machinery visible, and electricity may be credited with the\r\nmotive power, because the dial is suspended by two wires. But they will\r\nsoon be perceived not to be connected with the hands, and all search\r\nfor the mechanism will be fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe hands, moreover, turn backwards or forwards, and may be moved\r\nby a treacherous finger, but will always return as by a balanced\r\nmotion to their position, not the hour which they _were_ at, but to\r\nthe time which it actually _is_. They will take their proper place\r\nnotwithstanding all efforts to the contrary, and will then, if let\r\nalone, indicate the time as steadily as ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 881.—M. Robert’s clock.]\r\n\r\nThe hands of this very mysterious timepiece carry their own motive\r\npower, and consist of unequally balanced levers, so to speak, in which\r\nthe clockwork arrangement is intended to disturb the equilibrium. This\r\nproperty is employed to indicate the hour and the minute, as we will\r\nattempt to show.\r\n\r\nThe minute hand is the balance, and it is very exactly poised. In\r\nthe round box fitted to the end of this hand a plate of platinum is\r\ndisplaced by clockwork. The centre of gravity being displaced every\r\ninstant by the revolution of the weight which goes round once in an\r\nhour, the minute hand is forced to follow, and carries the hour\r\nhand with it. By the hidden arrangements the hands are dependent\r\none upon the other, but remain independent in movement. If they be\r\nmoved backwards or forwards they will return automatically to their\r\nrespective places, and if turned quickly round the minute hand will\r\nreturn to the proper minute, and the hour hand to the hour.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is simple and ingenious; the principle, however, is\r\nnot absolutely novel, and before M. Robert applied it many attempts\r\nhad been made to move indicators by the machinery they themselves\r\ncontained. But M. Robert has succeeded in adapting the idea\r\nbeneficially and usefully, giving it a practical as well as an elegant\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW CALCULATING DIAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Fig. 882.—A new calculating dial.      Fig. 883.—Reverse view.]\r\n\r\nThe small instrument herewith illustrated (figs. 882 and 883) is\r\nvery serviceable for calculators, and its size adapts it for the\r\nwaistcoat pocket. It can be used to calculate by addition, subtraction,\r\nmultiplication, and division. Logarithms can be found, and the powers\r\nand roots of numbers—even trigonometrical calculations may be made\r\nby its aid. We need not go into any details regarding the principle\r\nof the little “circle.” Such explanations are only wearying and\r\nunsatisfactory at best. The principle is, simply stated, the theorem\r\nthat the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum\r\nof their logs. The size of the dial will of course regulate the length\r\nof the calculation. The instrument depicted permits of calculation\r\nto three figures with exactitude. M. Boucher, the inventor, hopes to\r\nsucceed in perfecting an instrument of small size which will combine\r\nall _desiderata_, and calculate to high powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEDOMETER.\r\n\r\nWe all know how useful it is to be able to calculate distances\r\napproximately when upon an excursion or walking tour, and much trouble\r\nis taken by many tourists to ascertain the number of miles they may\r\nhave walked in a certain time. The rapid success which the Pedometer\r\nhas gained is a testimony to the need it has adapted itself to fill.\r\n\r\nThe pedometer is much like an ordinary watch in appearance and size.\r\nWe perceive a dial with figures and spaces to show the number of paces\r\nwalked. The cut represents the mechanism, which is exceedingly simple.\r\n\r\nIn the fig. 884, B is a counter-poise at the extremity of a lever,\r\nwhich oscillates around an axis, A. A screw, V, serves to limit\r\nthe extent of these oscillations, and a spring which acts upon the\r\ncounter-poise holds the latter to the upper end. The apparatus is\r\ncompleted by a movement which counts the number of oscillations of the\r\nlever.\r\n\r\nSo much being understood, it will be presumed that if we give to the\r\ninstrument an “up-and-down” movement, the spring which holds the\r\ncounter-poise, B, being too weak to compensate the force of inertion\r\nof the latter, it gives way and presses against the screw, V. When the\r\nopposite movement takes place the counter-poise is at the end of its\r\ncourse, and so on. Thus during a walk each step produces an oscillation\r\nwhich the counter registers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 884.—Pedometer.]\r\n\r\nIn the hands of a careful observer, such a pedometer is capable of\r\nregistering exact results, and the number of paces being counted, a\r\nvery good idea of the number of yards and miles passed over can be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Kampulos, a curve; metron, measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll branches of applied science are capable of giving us important\r\nhints and rendering us great service in all the conditions of our daily\r\nlife, and as we have at various times throughout this volume mentioned\r\nuseful domestic inventions applicable for use by means of water, air,\r\netc., we may describe some more particularly relating to the inside of\r\nthe house, and the science of domestic economy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 885.—Double window.]\r\n\r\nSometimes during the winter we may feel it very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to keep the room warm. This we can do, however, by means of\r\ndouble windows.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the double window as used in Russia keeps out the cold\r\nso well? Is it because the room is defended against frost by two\r\nwindows instead of there being only one to resist it?—Not entirely.\r\nSuch an explanation is not sufficient. If one be protected against the\r\nexterior cold, it is, thanks to the mass of air which is imprisoned,\r\nbetween the two windows. Extraordinary as it may appear, the air is a\r\nvery bad conductor of heat, and forms the best insulator that one can\r\nfind. The heat of the apartment is then perfectly retained by means of\r\nthe air between the double windows.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the double window is not less useful during the summer,\r\nfor it prevents the entrance of the heated air into the house. The\r\ndouble window may therefore be compared to the bournous of the Arab and\r\nthe cloak of the Spaniard, which preserves from heat as well as guards\r\nagainst cold.\r\n\r\nThe double windows also perform another service. The glasses form a\r\nhot-house. The sun heats the air which is enclosed, and thus between\r\nthe panes ferns and even vines will flourish. The windows are very easy\r\nto make, and in the event of any reader desiring to construct one or\r\nmore, we give the dimensions. (_See_ fig. 885.)\r\n\r\nT T, is the exterior frame of the window. The two panes are mounted\r\non a frame of wood, and are represented by A A´ and B B´ The sashes\r\nare represented apart, P and P´ are the shutters of sheet iron, which,\r\nif the walls be not so thick as represented, can be replaced by a\r\nspring-blind, which descends between the windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEWING MACHINE WORKED BY A DOG.\r\n\r\nAnimals have been employed for all time to draw carriages and the\r\nplough, etc. But these animal “motors” are usually employed under\r\ndefective conditions, and therefore without full profit. The inert\r\nmass of the animals remains quite unutilized, his force only is\r\nemployed, and there are many objections on the score of humanity, as\r\nwell as from a mechanical standpoint, and great muscular tension with\r\nsuffering may be inflicted upon an animal which is continually mounting\r\na wheel or such contrivance for raising water. There was in the Paris\r\nExhibition a threshing machine put in motion by a horse walking upon\r\na pair of rollers which constituted an “endless” way, and we will now\r\nbriefly describe a machine which utilizes animal force and weight. It\r\nis the invention of M. Richard of Paris, who has made many mechanical\r\napparatus for industrial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 886.—Sewing machine worked by a dog.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the invention (fig. 886) consists in the animal\r\nutilizing all the force resulting from his dead-weight. A small box\r\ncontains the dog very easily. In the illustration we see the dog at\r\nrest, and in that case he maintains his centre of gravity and exercises\r\nno force upon the wheel. But when the box is inclined, the mere weight\r\nof the animal is sufficient merely to turn the wheel in the direction\r\nof the arrows. The dog, finding himself sliding away, naturally\r\nendeavours to move forward, and the rotation of the wheel is continued;\r\nthe best results are obtained when the body is placed entirely upon the\r\ndescending line, and this result is owing only to the weight of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThere is a resting-place, just above and outside the “endless” way\r\ntraversed by the dog. A basin with water is also provided for the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nM. Robert was let to this discovery in the following way:—He employs a\r\nlarge number of sewing-machine hands, and finding that the working of\r\nthe machines had an injurious effect upon the health of the workers,\r\nhe determined to substitute, in part, other labour for that of female\r\nhands. He then thought out his “quadrupedal motors,” which are worked\r\nby intelligent dogs. There is very little trouble or expense connected\r\nwith the working, so a great saving is effected, as the dogs cost\r\nlittle, and are cheaply fed. The result is that M. Robert has four\r\nheavy machines occasionally at work, which are kept in motion by dogs\r\nat a very small expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLOCK-LAMP.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 887.—A clock-lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration (fig. 887) represents an ingenious arrangement, which,\r\nby means of combustion of oil in a lamp, indicates the hour of the\r\nnight. The design explains itself. Two vertical tubes are fixed above\r\nthe reservoir of oil. The left tube contains oil, and is marked with\r\nthe hours; the right tube burns the oil as a lamp.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is so constructed by the inventor, M. H. Behn, that a\r\ncertain quantity of oil is consumed exactly in one hour between two\r\ngraduations of the hour-tube. A reflector placed beside the lamp\r\nenables one to see the time by night very plainly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN “ALARUM” LAMP.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 888.—An “alarum” lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus represented below (fig. 888) is an ordinary “alarum”\r\nlamp. It is surmounted by a petroleum lamp, which carries a burner\r\nthat remains lighted all night, and which serves as a night-light.\r\nThe “alarum” carries an index, represented by the dotted lines in the\r\nillustration, and the hands are fixed (with the index) to the hour you\r\nwish to rise in the morning. The index is fitted with an arrangement\r\nwhich lets loose a vertical bar represented on the right of the figure.\r\nThis bar is held by a spring, and carries a toothed rack which acts\r\nupon and raises the wick. At the proper time the bar is loosed, and the\r\nlamp-wick is raised, diffusing a strong and sudden light through the\r\napartment. This illumination, in concert with an alarum-bell, generally\r\nsucceeds in awaking the heaviest sleeper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD PETROLEUM LAMP.\r\n\r\nThis lamp (fig. 889) burns gazoline without the least odour or danger\r\nof explosion. It will serve equally well for petroleum or naphtha. The\r\ngazoline used ought to be 660 grammes weight to the _litre_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 889.—A good petroleum lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe central portion of the lamp under consideration has an orifice,\r\nA B, which extends through the upper part, and by which the air is\r\nadmitted to the centre of the flame. Two vertical plates divide the\r\nair-current into four portions. The chimney-rest, or gallery, forms\r\nwith the glass three concentric envelopes, so arranged in stages that\r\nthe air, when it reaches the plates, may be more and more carried under\r\nthe flame. The orifices, _a_ _b_, carefully regulated, give access to\r\nthe exterior air. Including the central one, there are four currents of\r\nair, of which three strike against the flame. These are very excellent\r\nconditions for obtaining perfect combustion, and, consequently, there\r\nis an entire absence of smell and smoke, while the light is very\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nWe may add that any glass will be found suitable to this lamp, and\r\nthat, in consequence of the separation of the hot air by the currents\r\nmentioned, all danger of the glasses breaking from over-heating\r\nis avoided. In provincial districts, where lamp-glasses are not\r\nplentiful, this characteristic will be appreciated. The lamp can only\r\nbe filled when it is extinguished, and thus the chances of explosion\r\nare practically obviated. A burner of twelve lines will give double the\r\nlight of a moderator of the same capacity, and cost only a penny or\r\nless per hour. The light is perfectly still and clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW TAP.\r\n\r\nThis new tap is the invention of M. Guyonnet, a Frenchman. The\r\nillustration (fig. 890) gives a very good idea of its construction,\r\nand it permits the gradual release of the liquid without any of the\r\nsudden rush which ordinary taps, or “bungs,” are apt to do. The plug\r\nis covered with indiarubber, and follows a double curve, which reduces\r\nthe force of the liquid, and the indiarubber removes any incrustation\r\nfrom the bung hole into which it may be fitted, and closes the aperture\r\neffectively without force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 890.—A new tap.]\r\n\r\nIn order to guard against a contingency, which, however, is an unlikely\r\none, the “envelope” (casing) has been made in two pieces, one of which\r\ncan never be displaced; the head only can be moved, and it is easily\r\ndetached. The plug adapts itself to the aperture as a button to the\r\nbuttonhole, and only costs about three halfpence (15 centimes). Ice has\r\nno effect upon the aperture of the barrel, thanks to the indiarubber\r\ncovering of the plug. So, altogether, such a tap will be found useful\r\nand very cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAPEZE AND SWING.\r\n\r\nWe may here notice the simple trapeze and swing for children, which can\r\nbe easily fitted up in any house between two rooms. The advantages of\r\ngymnastics for the young are incontestable, but practically there are\r\ndifficulties in the way, particularly for those living in towns, but a\r\nskilful American has solved the problem in an ingenious way. He has\r\nfound means to suspend the trapeze and a swing between the doorposts\r\nof a room without nails or any unsightly wood supports. The trapeze is\r\nsimply suspended as represented in the accompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 891.—The house swing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 892.—The house trapeze.]\r\n\r\nThe bar, B (_see_ fig. 892), is of wood, terminating in screws enclosed\r\nin the grooves of the wood, at the extremity of which indiarubber discs\r\nare fixed (C and C´). When the bar is placed between the side posts\r\nof the open door and with the indiarubber in contact with the sides,\r\nthe bar, B, is vigorously screwed in the direction of the arrow, and\r\nthis motion is transmitted to the indiarubber discs which press against\r\nthe door, and the apparatus remains fixed. The trapeze cords, or the\r\nswing ropes, can be fastened to the bar with hooks, as shown in the\r\nillustration, and the solidity and safety of the bar may be tested by\r\nputting heavy weights upon the ropes before venturing upon the swing,\r\nor trapeze. Even violent exercises may be indulged in without any fear\r\nof falling if the bar be firmly screwed against the sides of the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE TOYS.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows us a circlet of paper, very thin,\r\nfastened upon a frame, with paper wings fixed to the radii. This\r\n“screw” fashioned wings and the circlet can be kept up in the air by\r\nmeans of a hand screen. The effect will be observable in the rapid\r\nrevolution of the little paper wheel, which must be very light and\r\nthin. (_See_ fig. 893.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 893.—The paper wheel.]\r\n\r\nThere are many toys which can be controlled by the use of indiarubber\r\nsprings. The bicyclist in the cut (fig. 894) is an instance in point.\r\nHe turns around a pivot, and the tension of the spring keeps the\r\nmachine in its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 894.—The bicycle toy.]\r\n\r\nThe swimming-fish (fig. 895) is moved by an indiarubber spring, much as\r\nthe drawing-room kite is elevated in the air. The spring of indiarubber\r\nis twisted to make the fish swim, and the caoutchouc is adapted to\r\na toothed wheel which has a clock-work motion that gives the tail a\r\nmotion sideways and round, acting like a propeller, and thus the fish\r\nswims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 895.—The fish.]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps as well to say how these fish are managed, because\r\nthen children will not break them, when they have been purchased, to\r\nsee what is inside. Very young students are very fond of analyses of\r\nthis nature, but synthesis, or putting together, is a far superior\r\noccupation in these circumstances to analysis, and to put together more\r\nlawful than to pull asunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE-FELLING BY STEAM.\r\n\r\nThe machine constructed a few years ago by Messrs. Ransome, and which\r\nwas tried at Roupell Park, near London, seems to combine all the\r\n_desiderata_ in the matter of mechanical tree-felling. Many experiments\r\nhave been previously made by people to cut down trees by means of steam\r\nmachinery, but none of them included all the conditions necessary for\r\nsuccess. The Ransome Machine cut down four large trees in forty minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 896.—Ransome’s tree-felling machine.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, as shown in the illustration, is not unlike, in\r\nappearance, the perforating machines employed in boring rocks, in which\r\nthe drill is replaced by a saw. The cylinder is small, and works at\r\nhigh pressure; a piston moves the saw in a guide-frame. The machine is\r\nfirmly fixed against the tree, and the support is fastened by a chain.\r\n\r\nA rack arrangement provides for the turning of the machine as the saw\r\ncontinues to cut its way through the trunk of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe weight is not excessive, and the necessary steam is supplied by a\r\nportable furnace and boiler, which communicates with the saw-motion\r\nby a flexible tube. The saw can cut through a horizontal as well as\r\nthrough a perpendicular trunk—thus timber can be rapidly cut up.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious sawing machine is that invented by Mr. W. W. Giles,\r\nof Chicago, United States, America. This apparatus is about eight\r\nfeet long, and one extremity is fixed to the trunk of the tree to be\r\noperated on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 897.—Sawing machine.]\r\n\r\nThe operator sits upon a ledge or saddle at the opposite end, and\r\nputting his feet upon the treadles, pushes them and the saw forward;\r\nthis movement is assisted by the weight of the hands on the lever. The\r\nsaw, under these circumstances, cuts into the wood with great force,\r\nand when the operator pushes _the lever_ forward he brings the force of\r\nhis legs to bear at the same time, and carries the saw back again. So\r\nfeet, hands, dead weight with the saw itself, combine at once upon the\r\ntree, and the blade quickly does its work. The saw is three feet long\r\nand is very easily manipulated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WAY OF PRESERVING GRAPES.\r\n\r\nRemarkable progress has been made of late years in the conservation of\r\nvarious articles of food, and we may here speak of the preservation of\r\nthe grape.\r\n\r\nWe will first mention M. R. Charmoux’s method, which is called the\r\n“Fresh Grape” system. The portion of the building used for the business\r\nis on the first floor, as nearly as possible in the centre of the\r\nbuilding, so as to be guarded from damp. Two windows are sufficient\r\nfor all purposes, one to the north, and one to the south. They may be\r\nmerely kept shut on ordinary occasions, but when frost comes they must\r\nbe draped and “packed” with nets filled with moss or dried seaweed. The\r\nprincipal one of the windows is to admit of the cleansing of the room\r\nand for the admission of air in the summer time, when there are not\r\nmany grapes left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 898.—Grape preserving.]\r\n\r\nIn winter the apartment may be warmed by hot air, and if this cannot\r\nbe managed the ordinary means must be resorted to to keep up the\r\ntemperature. The upper clusters of grapes should first be picked, for\r\nshade conduces to longevity of the fruit, and the 20th October is about\r\nthe time to commence. A fine day should be chosen; a cloudy day will\r\nsuit provided there is no dew or dampness in the air.\r\n\r\nThe finest bunches are cut first, and care must be taken to separate\r\nthem at the end of the stalk, having three “eyes” under the grape and\r\ntwo above it. The leaves should be at once cut off, and the grapes\r\nput with great caution into boxes or baskets to be taken to the\r\npreserving house, where each stalk is plunged into a phial holding\r\nabout 125 grammes of water, into which, two or three days previously, a\r\nteaspoonful of wood charcoal has been put.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 899.—Hanging the grapes.]\r\n\r\nThe phials are suspended as shown in the accompanying illustration\r\n(fig. 899), and then certain precautions must be observed: they must\r\nnot be disturbed, nor must any draught be admitted, as the temperature\r\nmust not descend below 1° to 2° cent. There is no necessity to change\r\nthe water in the bottles; very little will evaporate between November\r\nand May, when the process ought to be finished, but the phials must\r\nneither be corked nor concealed.\r\n\r\nIn the _dry_ process the same house can be used, and stagings are\r\nemployed. These frames are furnished with grooved boxes inclined\r\ntowards each other, and lined with very dry fern-leaves or straw (fig.\r\n900). Some days after the phials have been filled cut the grapes\r\nsuccessively at the first time, which generally begins about the 6th to\r\nthe 12th of November. The grapes are then put in baskets and carefully\r\ncarried to the preserving room, where they are ranged in the boxes so\r\nas not to touch. Each box contains about six kilogrammes of grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 900.—Drying process.]\r\n\r\nAll the time of the conservation process care must be taken to\r\neradicate all grapes which change colour or alter in any way. If\r\ndampness be feared have a lighted stove in the room for a time. Grapes\r\nare also preserved _en espalier_, but not so well. Sometimes a mouldy\r\nsmell will be perceived in the room; to prevent this ventilators should\r\nbe placed in the ceiling, which must, however, never be opened until\r\nthe mouldy smell renders such a proceeding absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nSOME CURIOUS MODES OF TRANSIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed some novel means of locomotion in the water and\r\nin the air, and now a few of the means whereby locomotion is attained\r\nas a recreation or as an exhibition may be mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 901.—New car.]\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a very curious vehicle, and the explanation of it\r\nwe give in the words of the anonymous inventor:—\r\n\r\n“My vehicle will carry four people without counting the driver.\r\nIt is strong, easy to draw, and can turn in a horse’s length. The\r\ndriver completely controls the animal, and no dust is thrown up to\r\ninconvenience the sitters, for by the time it rises the car is well in\r\nadvance of it. It is cheap; the harness is simple and safe. The horse\r\nis sheltered from heat and rain and flies. If he should fall, there\r\nis no more than ordinary danger to life and limb than if he fell in a\r\ncarriage; and, last of all, no very showy animal is needed, so long as\r\nhis wind is sound, and his legs and tail respectable. Travellers in\r\nthis “trap” can sit in any position, back to back, or face to face, two\r\nand two. The weight is all near the collar, and the animal is under\r\ncontrol most perfectly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 902.—Side view of vehicle.]\r\n\r\n“The estimated cost is £40; the horse about £40, or less; harness\r\n(say), £7, which contrasts favourably with the expenses of an ordinary\r\none horse vehicle.”\r\n\r\n\r\nENDLESS RAILS.\r\n\r\nThese adjuncts to locomotion can be adapted to any kind of vehicle, and\r\nare in pieces about two feet long, articulated, and resting upon a base\r\nto give the necessary stability. The endless rail entirely envelopes\r\nthe wheels all along the train, and the right and left rails are quite\r\nindependent of each other, and as the vehicles advance the rails are\r\nput down and raised again when the carriages have passed. In front\r\nthere are two distributing wheels governed by the tractive power, so\r\nthat as the engine, or the animal drawing the train turns aside, the\r\nrails are still laid down parallel as before, but the hind wheels will\r\nnot permit of very sharp curves.\r\n\r\nThere are wheels also at the rear of the train, and as on curves one\r\nwheel will pass over more rail than another, and in the hinder wheels\r\na differential arrangement is used, and when one goes back the other\r\nadvances as much, and so the relative distance is kept up, for the rail\r\ndoes not alter in length at all. The wheels have double flanges to\r\nretain them on the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 903.—Endless rails.]\r\n\r\nThe system, considered from a mechanical point of view, gives striking\r\nresults, and very little effort is required to put the train in motion.\r\nThe resistance is very small, and much greater weights can, of course,\r\nbe transported upon the endless rail than upon the ordinary road.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has been tried in the Tuilleries Gardens in Paris.\r\nThree carriages filled with children are drawn by two goats without\r\nany fatigue, and in the ordinary goat carriages at least twelve of the\r\nanimals would be necessary—that is, four to each carriage. The economy\r\nof this mode of transport is therefore incontestable. The usual rate is\r\nabout three-and-a-half to four miles an hour, so it is not adapted for\r\ntravellers, but for merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe system might be applied to numerous vehicles on all kinds of\r\nroads for horses and oxen, in mines and factories, and in colonial\r\nplantations. M. Ader, the inventor, intended the system to be applied\r\nin the Landes, where the rails would lie close upon the sandy soil, and\r\nthe expense of “metalling” roads would be entirely done away with. The\r\nadoption of the endless rail method of conveyance would prove a fortune\r\nto the Landes, where pine forests abound, and the wood and resin which\r\nis lost for want of transport could be removed and sold to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe endless rail may also be used upon the ordinary road in places\r\nwhere the highways are out of repair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 904.—The _Nina_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLEST STEAMBOAT IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe picture (fig. 904) shows us the _Nina_, the tiniest steamer afloat.\r\nThe keel is somewhat over twelve feet in length, and about three feet\r\nwide, the depth of water ten inches. A speed of about five-and-a-half\r\nmiles an hour can be obtained with a pressure of one hundred pounds. It\r\nis a twin-screw “ship” with propellers of three blades. The _Nina_ was\r\nbuilt on the lines of the _Nautilus_, of cedar and oak, and coppered.\r\nIt is stated to be a marvel of solidity and lightness. The chimney is\r\nmovable, and can be lowered at pleasure if a bridge be too low. There\r\nis ample room for provisions for the occupant in a frame which can be\r\nattached to the sides or fixed astern. The boat is easily carried in\r\nsections, and can be transported easily from place to place.\r\n\r\nThe weights of the various portions are as follows:—The hull 90 lb.,\r\nboiler 80 lb., engine 25 lb., machinery 20 lb.; total, 215 lb. Forty\r\npounds of good charcoal can be packed into the sides of the boat in\r\nracks. The rudder can be so connected by wires that the feet will\r\nperform the function of steering, thus leaving the hands free to attend\r\nto the engine, so the occupant is perfectly at liberty to go where and\r\nhow he pleases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 905.—An old chaise.]\r\n\r\nFor river navigation or calm sea-steaming the _Nina_ is admirably\r\nadapted, and any one who can be stoker, steersman, and engineer, as\r\nwell as passenger and crew, will enjoy a trip in such a boat. Such a\r\nsteamer costs about £250, but it might be less. It may be added that\r\nthe _Nina_ has uniformly behaved well, and was built by Fordham of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MECHANICAL CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nA distinguished _savant_ of the seventeenth century, Ozanam by name, a\r\nmember of the Academy of Science, gave in 1693 a curious description of\r\na mechanical carriage, which may perhaps be regarded as the parent of\r\nthe velocipede and the bicycle. We here reproduce the engravings from\r\nOzanam’s work and his words.\r\n\r\n“Some years ago,” wrote the philosopher in 1693, “there may have been\r\nseen in Paris a chaise,” as in the picture, “and which a servant,\r\nby pressing alternately upon treadles” (as in the detail), “caused\r\nto progress by turning two small wheels hidden in a frame between\r\nthe hinder pair of wheels of the chaise. The description I give as I\r\nreceived it from M. Richard, the doctor of Rochelle.\r\n\r\n“A A is a roller attached to the box behind the vehicle, B is a pulley,\r\nover which the cord that works with the treadles passes; C and D are\r\nthe treadles, with pedals, F F. The wheels, H H, being thus put in\r\nmotion, the large wheels are moved, and when the hind wheels move\r\nforward, the foremost ones must advance also, and the sitter has only\r\nto guide the machine by the reins he holds attached to the guiding\r\naxle.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 906.—The movement.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aberration, Chromatic, 104.\r\n\r\n
