As a general rule, each kind of turtle seemed\r\nto occur throughout one continuous river system or large tributary, and\r\nwith no barriers to dispersal therein and with the lapse of enough time\r\nfor a population to reach its limits of dispersal, the question arose,\r\n\"Where do subspecies and zones of intergradation occur?\" It seemed\r\nlogical to think that each isolated and continuous aquatic environment\r\nwould not contain more than one subspecies of the same species. In\r\nterrestrial environments subspecies and transitions between them were\r\nrecognizable. Terrestrial habitats were continuous for longer distances\r\nthan the isolated, aquatic habitats. But, different species of turtles\r\nprefer different kinds of aquatic habitats. Also, barriers occur in\r\nlarge drainage systems, such as the Mississippi, where, in general,\r\nthe western tributaries are sluggish, turbid and shallow, and the\r\neastern tributaries are fast-flowing, clear and deep. But in young,\r\nrelatively small, river systems that do not traverse radically different\r\nphysiographic regions, and that show no gross ecological differences,\r\nhabitats or microhabitats that do exist probably are only partial\r\nbarriers and seem not to prevent the dispersal of most kinds of aquatic\r\nturtles. Consequently, it seemed that study of the degree of difference\r\nbetween closely related populations of turtles that occurred in one\r\ndrainage system, or in adjacent drainage systems would indicate the\r\nlength of time, respectively, that the drainage system had been\r\ncontinuous or the length of time that two or more systems had been\r\nisolated from one another.\r\n\r\nRivers or series of river systems having endemic kinds of turtles or\r\nhaving the most kinds of turtles that are different from those in\r\nadjacent rivers may be the oldest geologically, or may have been\r\nisolated the longest. Knowledge of the kinds of turtles and their\r\nrelationships and distribution could indicate chronological changes in\r\naquatic habitats. Of course, modifying factors such as differences\r\nbetween populations of turtles in rates of evolutionary change, degrees\r\nof vagility, rates of dispersal, and overland migrations need to be\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\nMy accumulation of data on soft-shelled turtles was begun in the early\r\nnineteen-fifties. Although American softshells have been discussed in a\r\nrevisionary manner by Agassiz (1857), Siebenrock (1924), Stejneger\r\n(1944) and Neill (1951), the relationships of all the component\r\npopulations have not hitherto been appreciated. The present account\r\nattempts to combine in one publication what is known concerning the\r\ntaxonomy, geographic distribution, life history, and relationships of\r\nthe Recent American species and subspecies of the genus _Trionyx_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollecting Methods\r\n\r\nNocturnal collecting, by hand, from a boat that was nosed among brush\r\npiles along the shore line of rivers (Chaney and Smith, 1950:323) in the\r\nearly 1950's on rivers of the Gulf Coast drainage east of Texas yielded\r\nmany turtles of the genus _Graptemys_ but few softshells. Chaney and\r\nSmith (_loc. cit._) reported only one softshell among 336 turtles taken\r\nin 21 collecting hours on July 5, 6 and 7 on the Sabine River; Cagle and\r\nChaney (1950:385), however, recorded 11.6 per cent softshells of 208\r\nturtles (collecting time not stated) taken on the Caddo Lake Spillway in\r\nLouisiana. Using hoop-nets is probably the most efficient method for\r\ncollecting softshells considering the time and effort involved, and is\r\nthe chief method I have used. Lagler (1943a:24) mentioned the use of\r\nwatermelon rind as an effective bait. Kenneth Shain (field notes)\r\ntrapped _T. spinifer emoryi_ in hoop-nets baited with bread. I have used\r\nchopped fresh fish with most success; canned sardines have also been\r\nsatisfactory. These baits seem to be more successful for trapping\r\n_spinifer_ than they are for _muticus_. Hoop-nets were used to trap\r\nturtles in Lake Texoma, Oklahoma, from June 14 to July 2, 1954. The\r\nnumber of traps (usually four, rarely five) and trapping success varied\r\nwith location. Of 156 turtles, 19 (12%) were _T. spinifer_ and one was\r\n_T. muticus_.\r\n\r\nTrotlines and set lines frequently catch softshells; sport fishermen\r\noften complain of catching these turtles on hook and line. Live worms,\r\nsoft-bodied insects, small crawfish, minnows, small pieces of fish and\r\nother kinds of meat are adequate bait. Capture depends on the skill of\r\nattachment of the bait and the size of hook used. In my experience,\r\nsoftshells (mostly _spinifer_) were taken on trotlines that were set in\r\nlakes or the slower-moving parts of rivers a few inches below the\r\nsurface. I have records of only two _muticus_ taken on trotlines.\r\nGoin (1948:304) stated that commercial fishermen catch softshells on\r\ntrotlines set for catfish on the bottom of river beds. Evermann and\r\nClark (1920:595) found softshells to be caught more often than any\r\nother kind of turtle in traps, on set lines, and by anglers in Lake\r\nMaxinkuckee, Indiana. Some residents of the South tell of so placing\r\nbaits that turtles are lured to tread water against an object set with\r\nrecurved hooks upon which the webbing of the forelimbs are impaled.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of _muticus_ and _spinifer_ frequently bury themselves in\r\nsand in shallow water and can be collected by hand by noting swirls or\r\ndisturbances on the bottom caused by a turtle withdrawing its head\r\n(Conant, 1951:156, 159). Professional turtle collectors take them by\r\n\"noodeling\" (Conant, _op. cit._:160); Lagler (1943a:22) elaborated on\r\nthe method of \"noodling.\" P. W. Smith (1947:39) remarked that 20 or more\r\nsoftshells were taken \"within a few hours by probing sand bars at the\r\nwater edge\" near Charleston, Illinois. From a distance I observed an\r\nindividual of _T. s. asper_ bury itself in shallow water on the Escambia\r\nRiver, Florida. Small individuals of _muticus_ have been taken by hand\r\nalong the shore of Lake Texoma. Along the Flint River near Bainbridge,\r\nGeorgia, two hatchlings that were buried in sand in shallow water\r\nemerged at my approach and scurried a few inches, then buried themselves\r\nagain. Larger turtles seem to be more wary. One that was disturbed,\r\nemerged from the sand and swam toward deep water.\r\n\r\nIn clear water, water-goggling may be effective in securing softshells.\r\nMarchand (_in_ Carr, 1952:417-18) mentioned that softshells (_ferox_)\r\ncan be found buried in deep water with only the heads visible; the\r\nturtles are not easily frightened under water and may be captured by\r\ngrasping their necks. A similar technique described by Allen and Neill\r\n(1950:3) resulted in the capture of trionychid turtles. In clear water\r\nof the White River, Arkansas, I collected a few softshells by hand as\r\nthey lay on the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn shallow-water areas of large rivers, lakes and tributaries, seining\r\noften procures softshells. Methods used in fisheries investigations such\r\nas the application of rotenone and electric shockers, and even\r\ndynamiting, sometimes yield soft-shelled turtles. Carr (1952:419) wrote\r\nthat numbers of _ferox_ were incapacitated by rotenone in Florida lakes,\r\nalthough no other species of turtle was affected. I captured a snapping\r\nturtle (_Chelydra serpentina_) that was immobilized by the current from\r\nan electric shocker in a small, alga-choked tributary of Cache Creek,\r\nComanche County, Oklahoma; presumably turtles must come in close contact\r\nwith the electrodes to be affected (see discussion by Gunning and Lewis,\r\n1957:52).\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of gill nets in trapping turtles is indicated by\r\ninformation kindly supplied by Mr. Alfred Houser on gill-net operations\r\nfrom July through December, 1952, under the direction of Mr. \"Bud\"\r\nOldham, a commercial fisherman. The 4-inch mesh nets were in Lake Texoma\r\nat the mouth of Briar Creek, two miles south of Powell, Marshall County,\r\nOklahoma, in 25 to 30 feet of water. Eighty to 90 per cent of the\r\nturtles secured were softshells; more were taken near shoreline than\r\naway from shore even though the depth was about the same. An average of\r\nonly one turtle every four days was taken in July and August when the\r\nturtles presumably are most active (Table 1). One gill-net day is\r\nequivalent to one gill net, 200 yards long, operated for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 1.

Of 75 turtles collected from July 1 through October 18, 1953,\r\n66 were _Trionyx_ (_spinifer_ and _muticus_), five were _Graptemys_ and\r\nfour were _Pseudemys scripta_. No more than two gill nets were used\r\nsimultaneously. The nets were moved from time to time and varied in\r\ndimensions, but those used most of the time were 200 feet long and eight\r\nfeet deep with a 3-inch mesh.\r\n\r\nThe few captures by Houser probably resulted from long-continued\r\ntrapping in one place; the gill nets were not moved in the entire\r\nsix-month period or for some time previously. Breckenridge (1955:6)\r\ncommented on the sedentary nature of _spinifer_ (in Minnesota) and\r\nquoted a professional turtle trapper as stating that \"after a section of\r\na river has been trapped heavily for softshells, little success can be\r\nexpected in that area for as much as three or four years thereafter.\"\r\nBoth Houser's and Dowell's data indicate a higher percentage of\r\nsoft-shelled turtles collected than any other species. The number\r\ncaught probably depends, at least partly, on the food habits of the\r\nspecies and is influenced by the enmeshed fish, which, serving as a food\r\nsource, attract the turtles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials and Procedures\r\n\r\nIn the course of this study I examined 1849 soft-shelled turtles,\r\nincluding some incomplete alcoholic or dried specimens, such as those\r\nrepresented only by skulls or by other osteological material.

An inspection of the\r\nscattergrams indicated regressions essentially linear in nature, but\r\nsometimes occasioned an arbitrary separation of samples into size\r\ngroups to show ontogenetic variation; no secondary sexual differences\r\ncould be discerned. Several ratios were developed from the\r\nmeasurements. The data correspond to the regression model 1A in\r\n\"Statistical Methods\" (Snedecor, 1956, sec. 6.13); consequently, the\r\nsample ratios indicate the slope of regression and are useful in\r\ncomparisons. Sample-means and their estimated standard errors are\r\ncompared graphically to show general trends in proportional\r\ncharacters. Comparisons of means and standard errors indicate\r\nstatistical significance between populations if the sample-means plus\r\nor minus twice their standard errors do not overlap, but this method\r\nof comparison is valid only when comparing two samples (Pimentel,\r\n1959:100).\r\n\r\nIn the section on \"Variation,\" general features applicable to all\r\nkinds of soft-shelled turtles are discussed under the following\r\nheadings: secondary sexual, ontogenetic, and geographic; individual\r\nvariation is mentioned in accounts of species and subspecies. In the\r\nsection \"Character Analysis\" external and osteological characters\r\nhaving taxonomic significance are discussed.\r\n\r\nVernacular names follow, as closely as possible, those recommended by\r\nthe Committee on Herpetological Common Names (1956). The synonymy of\r\neach monotypic species or subspecies begins with the name as given in\r\nthe original description. The second entry is the name-combination\r\nherein applied to the taxon. Other entries are first usages, in\r\nchronological order, of other names (synonyms) that have been applied\r\nto the taxon in question. Next, the type is briefly discussed followed\r\nby the \"Range\" defined in general geographic terms, and, when\r\nappropriate, in terms of river drainage systems. \"Diagnosis\" includes\r\na combination of characters that facilitates quick identification. In\r\npolytypic species, the diagnosis of a subspecies is designed only to\r\ndistinguish it from other subspecies of that species. The comments\r\nincluded under the subsection entitled \"Description\" pertain to\r\nindividuals from an area where the taxon is most clearly\r\ndifferentiated. Because osteological characters are significant only\r\nat the specific level, they appear under the accounts of each species\r\n(excluding _ater_). Proportional characters as given in the\r\n\"Diagnosis\" are only in general terms; more specific data are set\r\nforth in the subsection, \"Description\" or in the various text figures,\r\nmostly in the section on \"Variation,\" page 445. Proportions pertaining\r\nto the species _muticus_ were derived only from the nominal\r\nsubspecies, and appear under the account of the species. A subsection\r\n\"Variation\" under the accounts of some subspecies includes information\r\nconcerning principally individual variation and coloration; because\r\ncolor is not considered to be of major taxonomic importance, color\r\nterms are used without reference to any standard color guide. The\r\nsubsection \"Remarks\" follows the section on \"Comparisons,\" and may\r\ninclude comments on nomenclature, intergradation and other information\r\nrelated to the distribution or taxonomy of the subspecies.\r\n\r\nThe probable geographic range of each species and subspecies is shown\r\non one of the maps. Locality records of specimens that I have examined\r\nare shown by solid circles. Additional records of occurrence\r\n(published records or specimens otherwise not seen) are shown by\r\nhollow circles. Localities only a short distance apart share the same\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nUnder the subsection \"Specimens examined,\" a number in parentheses\r\nfollowing a museum number indicates the number of specimens referable\r\nto that museum number. All localities of specimens examined are\r\nindicated on one of the maps. The list of specimens is arranged\r\nalphabetically by states (Canadian provinces precede states of the\r\nUnited States under the account of _T. spinifer spinifer_, and Mexican\r\nstates follow those of the United States under _T. s. emoryi_),\r\nalphabetically by counties, and within a county alphabetically by\r\nabbreviations of museums; then, museum catalogue numbers are arranged\r\nconsecutively. Records in the literature are not included if they\r\nrefer to the same locality from which at least one specimen has been\r\nexamined, or refer to a less restricted locality that includes the\r\narea from which at least one specimen has been examined. Localities\r\nwithin a county are arranged alphabetically by author; the appropriate\r\nreference may follow several localities.\r\n\r\nAll generic, specific and subspecific names (but not all the different\r\nkinds of name-combinations) that have been applied to American\r\nsoft-shelled turtles are listed in a subsection entitled \"Synonymy\"\r\nunder the heading \"Genus Trionyx Geoffroy, 1809.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nCompletion of this study has been made possible only by the\r\nco-operation of those persons in charge of the collections listed\r\nabove and I am grateful to them for the privilege of examining\r\nspecimens. Also I wish to thank Dr. E. Raymond Hall for the facilities\r\nafforded by the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas,\r\nas well as for editorial assistance in the preparation of the\r\nmanuscript, and especially Dr. Henry S.

Baker, Dr. Fred R. Cagle, Mr. J. Keever Greer, Dr.\r\nA. Byron Leonard, Dr. Carl D. Riggs, and Dr. Edward H. Taylor deserve\r\nespecial mention for aid extended in the course of this study. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. J. C. Battersby, British Museum (Natural History),\r\nLondon, for information concerning the type of _Trionyx ferox_, to Dr.\r\nJean Guibé, Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, for information\r\nconcerning the types of _Trionyx muticus_, _T. spinifer_ and _T.\r\ncarinatus_, and photographs of the types of _T. muticus_, _T.\r\nspinifer_ and _T. ocellatus_, and to Dr. Lothar Forcart of the\r\nNaturhistorisches Museum, Basel, Switzerland, for information\r\npertaining to a published record of _T. muticus_.\r\n\r\nThe maps and figures are the work of Miss Lucy Jean Remple and Mrs.\r\nLorna Cordonnier, University of Kansas. Dr. John M. Legler, University\r\nof Utah, prepared most of the photographs on plates 1-20; photographs\r\nas mentioned in the preceding paragraph were received from Dr. Guibé,\r\none was provided through the co-operation of Roger Conant and Isabelle\r\nHunt Conant, another was furnished by Mr. J. Keever Greer, and the\r\nothers were taken by me. Field work was financed in part by funds\r\nprovided by the Sigma Xi-RESA Research Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Trionychidae Bell, 1828\r\n\r\nRecent soft-shelled turtles comprise a well-defined assemblage of the\r\nfamily Trionychidae. Although the scope of this study does not involve\r\nan assay of the relationships of the soft-shelled turtles of the Old\r\nWorld, a brief résumé that includes some of the salient characteristics\r\nof the family is included.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Articulation between last cervical and first dorsal\r\nvertebrae by zygopophyses only; preplastra separated from hyoplastra\r\nby /\\-shaped epiplastron, entoplastron absent (Williams and McDowell,\r\n1952:263-75); marginal bones absent or forming an incomplete series,\r\nnot connected with ribs that extend beyond pleural plates; claws on\r\nonly three inner digits; fourth digit having four or more phalanges;\r\nplastron united to carapace by ligamentous tissue (Smith, 1931:147).\r\n\r\n_General characters._--Size large, \"... some attaining probably 5 feet\r\nin length of carapace\" (Boulenger, 1890:10); body depressed; carapace\r\nand plastron lacking horny epidermal shields, covered instead with\r\nsoft skin; snout ending in fleshy, tubate proboscis; jaws concealed by\r\nfleshy lips; tail short; digits well-webbed; cervical vertebrae\r\nopisthocoelous (eighth having double articulation in front); neck\r\nelongate, cervical region equaling or exceeding length of dorsal\r\nvertebral column; head and neck completely retractile, bending by\r\nmeans of sigmoid curve in vertical plane; ear hidden; skull elongate,\r\nhaving three posterior projections (median one produced by\r\nsupraoccipital and two lateral projections formed chiefly by\r\nsquamosals); temporal region emarginate posteriorly, forming wide\r\nshallow fossa; premaxillae fused; an intermaxillary foramen;\r\npterygoids separated by basisphenoid that contacts palatines; vomer,\r\nif present, not separating palatines; pelvis not fused to carapace and\r\nplastron; plastron reduced, a median vacuity usually present; plastral\r\nbones developing sculpturing with increase in size, forming four to\r\nseven so-called plastral callosities; carapace with or without\r\nprenuchal bone; nuchal overlapping or overlapped by first pleural;\r\nneurals in continuous series or interrupted by pleurals; bony plates\r\nof carapace sculptured; mandible having well-developed coronoid bone;\r\ncutaneous femoral valves that conceal hind limbs present or absent;\r\ntwo or three pairs of scent glands; cloacal bursae absent (Smith and\r\nJames, 1958:89); forelimbs having antebrachial scalation; body of\r\nhyoid apparatus formed of two or three pairs of bones; penis broad,\r\nexpanded and pentifid, sulcus spermaticus quadrifid having branches in\r\neach of four lateral projections (Hoffman, 1890:298, pl. 47, fig. 2);\r\naquatic, principally in fresh water; mainly carnivorous; flesh of many\r\nspecies eaten. (See Boulenger, 1889:237-41; Loveridge and Williams,\r\n1957:412; Romer, 1956:513; Smith, _op. cit._:147-54).\r\n\r\n_Recent distribution_ (Figure 1).--North America, from extreme\r\nsoutheastern Canada and eastern United States west to Rocky Mountains\r\nand south to northern México; introduced in southwestern United States\r\n(Conant, 1958:69-73). Africa, from Egypt and Senegal south to Angola\r\nand Zambesi River drainage (Loveridge and Williams, _op.\r\ncit._:412-68); occurrence of _Trionyx triunguis_ in Syria (Boulenger,\r\n_op. cit._:255) and coastal streams of Palestine (Schmidt and Inger,\r\n1957:36) considered accidental by Flower (1933:753-54). Southwestern\r\nAsia (Tigris and Euphrates River drainage) in eastern Turkey, Syria,\r\nIraq and northeastern Israel (Mertens and Wermuth, 1955:388).\r\nSoutheastern Asia, from Pakistan and India (Indus River drainage) and\r\nManchuria and adjacent Siberia (Amur River drainage) to Ceylon, Japan,\r\nFormosa, Hainan, Luzon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Timor and southeastern\r\nNew Guinea (De Rooij, 1915:325-32; Okada, 1938:108; Pope, 1935:60-64;\r\nSmith, 1931:158-79; Stejneger, 1907:514-532; Taylor, 1920:141).\r\n\r\n_Trionyx cartilagineus_ is questionably recorded from the Moluccas (De\r\nRooij, _op. cit._:330). _T. sinensis_ has been introduced on Kauai\r\nIsland, Hawaiian Islands (Brock, 1947:142; Oliver and Shaw, 1953:83),\r\none of the Bonin Islands (Okada, 1930:187-94), and probably Timor (De\r\nRooij, _op. cit._:331). All insular records east of Borneo and Java\r\nare probably the result of introductions, except perhaps those of\r\n_Pelochelys_ on Luzon and New Guinea (Darlington, 1957:210).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Geographic distribution of the family\r\n       Trionychidae.]\r\n\r\n_Recent genera._--According to Mertens and Wermuth (1955:387-95), there\r\nare 21 species belonging to six genera as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Chitra_ Gray, 1844 (1)\r\n  _Cyclanorbis_ Gray, 1854 (2)\r\n  _Cycloderma_ Peters, 1854 (2)\r\n  _Lissemys_ Smith, 1931 (1)\r\n  _Pelochelys_ Gray, 1864 (1)\r\n  _Trionyx_ Geoffroy, 1809 (14)\r\n\r\n_Dogania_ is considered a synonym of _Trionyx_ (Loveridge and Williams,\r\n_op. cit._:422).\r\n\r\n_Geologic range._--Lower Cretaceous (possibly Upper Jurassic) to Recent\r\nof Asia; Upper Cretaceous to Recent of North America; Paleocene (Upper\r\nJurassic, assuming _Trionyx primoevus_ is a trionychid) to Pleistocene\r\nof Europe; Lower Miocene to Recent of Africa; Pleistocene to Recent in\r\nEast Indies (Loveridge and Williams, _op. cit._:412; Romer, 1945:594);\r\nquestionable trionychid fragments from Pleistocene of Australia\r\n(Darlington, _loc. cit._). $/\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The genera _Lissemys_, _Cyclanorbis_ and _Cycloderma_ are\r\ndistinguished from _Pelochelys_, _Chitra_ and _Trionyx_ by several\r\ncharacters (Loveridge and Williams, _op. cit._:414). The recognition of\r\ntwo groups of genera caused Deraniyagala (1939:290) to erect two\r\nfamilies, Cyclanorbidae and Trionychidae. An appraisal of fossils\r\nprompted Hummel (1929:768) to propose two corresponding subfamilies,\r\nCyclanorbinae and Trionychinae. Williams (1950:554) considered the two\r\ngroups as subfamilies (Lissemydinae and Trionychinae).\r\n\r\nBaur (1887:97) regarded the Trionychidae as constituting a separate\r\nsuborder distinct from the rest of the living turtles. Later (1891),\r\nhowever, he pointed out the resemblances of the Trionychidae and\r\nCarettochelyidae (having one living genus in New Guinea), and the\r\ncryptodiran affinities of _Carettochelys_. Bergounioux (1932:1408)\r\nmentioned the close resemblance of the Carettochelyidae to _Trionyx_ but\r\nconsidered the former as having pleurodiran affinities, a view adopted\r\nby Deraniyagala (_loc. cit._). Most students now consider the two\r\nfamilies to be closely related, and conceive of both as members of the\r\nsuborder Cryptodira (Hummel, 1929:768; Williams, _loc. cit._; Mertens\r\nand Wermuth, 1955).\r\n\r\nThe oldest trionychid fossil, _Trionyx primoevus_, is from marine\r\ndeposits of the Upper Jurassic (Kiméridgien) from \"Cap de la Hève,\" and\r\nits characters do not indicate the kind of cryptodiran ancestor from\r\nwhich the family arose (Bergounioux, _op. cit._:1409; 1937:188). Lane\r\n(1910:350) found that the entoplastron (= epiplastron) was paired in\r\nembryos of _Trionyx_ and regarded that genus as the most primitive of\r\nthe order; he also mentioned Wiedersheim's report of rudiments of teeth\r\nin embryos of _Trionyx_. Baur (1891:637-38) thought that the family\r\narose directly from the Amphichelydia, that the ancestors of the\r\nTrionychidae closely resembled _Carettochelys_ in the structure of the\r\ncarapace and plastron, and that a progressive reduction in ossification\r\nof those structures occurred. Nopcsa (1926:654) also wrote that the\r\nfamily originated from ancestors having a well-developed plastron; he\r\nmaintained that the progressive reduction in ossification of the\r\nplastron was a specialization for aquatic life, and that the more\r\nprimitive trionychids had the best developed bones and callosities.\r\nHummel (1929:772) also thought that there had been a progressive\r\nreduction in ossification. Bergounioux (1932:1408; 1936:1088,\r\n1952:2304), on the contrary, thought that there had been a progressive\r\nincrease in ossification of the marginal bones in both families as well\r\nas of the plastron (1936:1088; 1937:190). Zangerl's study of the shell\r\nelements of turtles (1939:393) indicated that _Trionyx_ was highly\r\nspecialized in having a well-developed epithecal armor (sculptured\r\ncallosities, neurals and costals), and that it occurred in most aquatic\r\nturtles; the development in soft-shells suggested that members of the\r\nfamily had maintained an aquatic mode of life over a long period of\r\ngeologic time, a view supported by Deraniyagala (1930:1066). Of interest\r\nare Stunkard's remarks (1930:214-18) concerning several _Trionyx\r\nspinifer_ that were obtained from a commercial supply house and found to\r\nbe infested with pronocephalid trematodes (_Opisthoporus_ [=\r\n_Teloporia_] _aspidonectes_). The closest relatives of that trematode\r\n(also recorded from _T. ferox_) live in marine turtles. Possibly, a\r\nMesozoic ancestor of marine and essentially fresh-water soft-shelled\r\nturtles harboured ancestors of these trematodes, but possibly the\r\nparasites may have transferred relatively recently to their present\r\nhosts. Bergounioux (1937:190) judged the Trionychidae to be an ancient\r\ngroup of marine origin. Hummel (1929:770) wrote that the Trionychidae\r\noriginated in east Asia (the region of most differentiation) in humid\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nBaur (1891:634, 637) pointed out that the dorsal aspect of the skull of\r\nthe closely related _Carettochelys_ resembles the skull of the\r\nDermatemydidae, Staurotypidae and Kinosternidae; the close relationship\r\nof _Carettochelys_ and the Dermatemydidae is also mentioned by\r\nBergounioux (1952:2304) and Hummel (1929:769). Hummel (_op. cit._:771)\r\nthought that the Carettochelyidae and \"die Chelydroiden\" had a common\r\nancestor, and that (_op. cit._:772) the origin of the Trionychidae was\r\nolder than those two groups. Dunn (1931:109) wrote that the\r\nKinosternidae, Carettochelyidae and Dermatemydidae represented the same\r\ngeneral ancestry. Williams (1950:552) has shown the resemblance of the\r\ncervical articulations in members of the Chelydridae (including\r\nStaurotypinae and Kinosterninae) and the Central American family\r\nDermatemydidae. The consensus of opinion, then, is that the families\r\nTrionychidae, Carettochelyidae, Chelydridae and Dermatemydidae are\r\nrelatively closely related.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus =Trionyx= Geoffroy, 1809\r\n\r\n    _Testudo_ Linnaeus (in part), Syst.

Schweigger, nevertheless, probably was the first\r\nperson to recognize the soft-shelled turtles as a distinct group, and\r\nhe proposed for it the name _Amyda_ in an unpublished manuscript that\r\nhe sent to Geoffroy. The latter author (1809a:15) relegated the name\r\n_Amyda_ to the synonomy of _Trionyx javanicus_ by means of the\r\nfollowing entry: \"_Amyda javanica._ Schweigger, dans un manuscript\r\ncommunique a l'Institut.\" Stejneger (1944:7) maintained that this\r\npublication of Schweigger's monotypic generic name clearly established\r\nits availability for the species congeneric with _Amyda javanica_ (=\r\n_Testudo cartilaginea_ Boddaert, 1770). Loveridge and Williams\r\n(1957:422) contend that this mere mention of the name _Amyda_ neither\r\nconstitutes the proposal of a new name nor validates it, and that the\r\nfirst valid usage of the name _Amyda_ is that of Fitzinger (1835:120),\r\nwho later (1843:30) designated the type species as _Amyda subplana_.\r\nThe name _Amyda_ cannot date from _Oken_ (1816:348) as Volume 3\r\n[Zoologie] of his Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte published in 1815-1816\r\nhas been placed on the Official Index of Rejected and Invalid Works in\r\nZoological Nomenclature with the Title No. 33; see Opinion 417\r\n(Hemming, 1956).\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable debate as to whether Geoffroy did or did\r\nnot designate a type species of the genus _Trionyx_ (1809a). Although\r\nnot specifically designated as the type species, _Trionyx aegyptiacus_\r\n(= _Testudo triunguis_ Forskål) is considered by Smith (1930:2),\r\nSchmidt (1953:108, footnote), and Loveridge and Williams (1957:422) to\r\nhave been sufficiently indicated by Geoffroy as the type species. But\r\nStejneger (1944:6), H. M. Smith (1947:122), Conant and Goin\r\n(1948:11), and Mertens and Wermuth (1955) maintained that Geoffroy did\r\nnot adequately designate a type species, and that Fitzinger (1843:30)\r\ndesignated the type species as _Trionyx granosus_ (= _Lissemys\r\npunctata_), a synonym of Geoffroy's species, _coromandelicus_.\r\n\r\nIf Fitzinger's designation of a type species is accepted, the name\r\n_Trionyx_ is applicable to the forms herein referred to _Lissemys_,\r\nand _Amyda_ to the American forms. If Geoffroy's designation is\r\naccepted, the American forms are referable to _Trionyx_, and _Amyda_\r\nis a synonym.\r\n\r\nThe preceding includes only those generic names (listed in\r\nchronological order) that have been applied to Recent American\r\nsoft-shelled turtles. Generic synonyms of the genus _Trionyx_\r\napplicable to Old World species are listed by Stejneger (1907:514),\r\nSmith (1931:165), and Loveridge and Williams (1957:420-21).\r\n\r\n_Trionyx_ is the most widespread genus of the family; most of the\r\nspecies occur in southeastern Asia. All North American soft-shelled\r\nturtles belong to this genus.\r\n\r\nFor quick reference, all the specific and subspecific names proposed\r\nfor soft-shelled turtles in North America are listed below in\r\nalphabetical order (left hand column) with their nomenclatural status\r\nas recognized in this paper. The synonyms are listed in the account of\r\nthe appropriate species or subspecies, and are discussed under the\r\nsubsection entitled \"Remarks.\"\r\n\r\n  _agassizi_          _Trionyx  spinifer asper_\r\n  _annulifer_         _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _argus_             _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _asper_             _Trionyx  spinifer asper_\r\n  _ater_              _Trionyx  ater_\r\n  _bartrami_          _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _emoryi_            _Trionyx  spinifer emoryi_\r\n  _calvatus_          _Trionyx  muticus calvatus_\r\n  _ferox_             _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _georgianus_        _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _georgicus_         _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _harlani_           _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _hartwegi_          _Trionyx  spinifer hartwegi_\r\n  _hudsonica_         _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _mollis_            _Trionyx  ferox_\r\n  _microcephalus_     _Trionyx  muticus muticus_\r\n  _muticus_           _Trionyx  muticus muticus_\r\n  _nuchalis_          _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _ocellatus_         _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _olivaceus_         _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n  _spiniferus_        _Trionyx  spinifer spinifer_\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation\r\n\r\nAside from qualitative variations and comparisons of patterns of\r\npigmentation the following external measurements (to the nearest\r\nmillimeter) were used.\r\n\r\n_Length of plastron_: Maximal straight-line measurement\r\n(midventrally), from the anteriormost region of the ventral surface to\r\nthe posterior end of the plastron; this measurement includes an\r\nanterior cartilaginous part.\r\n\r\n_Length of carapace_: Maximal, straight-line measurement\r\n(middorsally), from the nuchal region to the posteriormost region of\r\nthe free edge of the carapace.\r\n\r\n_Width of carapace_: Maximal, straight-line measurement between the\r\nlateral margins of the carapace.\r\n\r\n_Plane of greatest width of carapace_: Maximal, straight-line\r\nmeasurement from the posteriormost region of the free edge of the\r\ncarapace to a point on the middorsal line at the level or plane of the\r\ngreatest width of the carapace; this measurement and the last two, of\r\ncourse, include the fringing cartilaginous parts of the dorsal bony\r\ncarapace.\r\n\r\n_Width of head_: Maximal measurement between the lateral margins of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n_Length of snout_: Measurement from tip of snout to interorbital\r\nregion of least breadth.\r\n\r\n_Diameter of ocellus_: Maximal outside diameter of largest (not\r\nconspicuously ovoid or oblong) ocellus on carapace.\r\n\r\nThe following ratios were developed from the measurements. Reference\r\nto these ratios will be made by the abbreviations within the\r\nparentheses: length of carapace/length of plastron (CL/PL); length of\r\ncarapace/width of carapace (CL/CW); length of carapace/plane of width\r\nof carapace (CL/PCW); length of plastron/width of head (PL/HW); width\r\nof head/length of snout (HW/SL); diameter of ocellus/length of\r\nplastron (OD/PL).\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Sexual Variation\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size_\r\n\r\nIn many species of turtles, females are larger than males; the\r\ndifference in size between the sexes is probably most pronounced in\r\naquatic emydids. The ten largest individuals of each sex were selected\r\nto indicate the relative difference in size between the sexes of the\r\nthree American species of _Trionyx_ (excluding _ater_, Table 2).\r\nFemale soft-shelled turtles attain a larger size than males. _T.\r\nferox_ is the largest species; _muticus_ is the smallest. The\r\napproximate maximal size of each sex and the difference in size\r\nbetween the sexes are more correctly expressed for _spinifer_ and\r\n_muticus_ than for _ferox_, because fewer specimens of _ferox_ were\r\nexamined; presumably the approximate maximal size of males and females\r\nof _ferox_ is larger than is indicated in Table 2.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 2. Secondary Sexual Difference in Maximal Size of North\r\n       American Species of the Genus Trionyx (excluding ater) Based\r\n       on the Ten Largest Specimens of Each Sex of Each Species.\r\n       The Extremes Precede the Mean (in parentheses).\r\n\r\n  =============+============================\r\n     SPECIES   |   Plastral length (cm.)\r\n  -------------+---------+------------------\r\n  _ferox_      | males   | 17.0-26.0 (20.0)\r\n               | females | 23.3-34.0 (27.9)\r\n               |         |\r\n  _spinifer_   | males   | 13.8-16.0 (14.4)\r\n               | females | 26.0-31.0 (28.0)\r\n               |         |\r\n  _muticus_    | males   | 11.8-14.0 (12.3)\r\n               | females | 17.7-21.5 (18.9)\r\n  -------------+---------+------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern_\r\n\r\nSecondary sexual differences in pattern are probably more pronounced\r\nin soft-shelled turtles than in other species of turtles, except\r\nperhaps for the well-known melanism and concomitant obliteration of\r\npattern acquired by some adult males of the _scripta_ section of the\r\ngenus _Pseudemys_.\r\n\r\nThe difference in pattern between the sexes of American species varies\r\nwith size of the individual and with the species and subspecies. The\r\njuvenal pattern of some individuals of _T. spinifer asper_ differs\r\naccording to sex. In the other species and subspecies, there are no\r\nsecondary sexual differences in the juvenal pattern. That pattern in\r\nfemales of all species and subspecies is partly or entirely obscured\r\nby a mottled and blotched pattern as growth proceeds. This mottled and\r\nblotched pattern is present on females not yet sexually mature, and is\r\nof contrasting lichenlike figures, and in other individuals is less\r\ncontrasting and a more uniform coloration. The largest males of _T.\r\nspinifer_ retain a conspicuous juvenal pattern; in those of _muticus_\r\nthe pattern may be well-defined or partly modified and obscured,\r\nwhereas in large males of _ferox_ the juvenal pattern is ill-defined\r\nor absent. No male normally acquires a contrasting mottled and\r\nblotched pattern on the carapace. The pattern on the carapace of many\r\nlarge individuals of _ferox_ is not distinctive as to sex.\r\n\r\nOn the dorsal surface of the soft parts of the body there is a\r\ncontrasting pattern in adult males and hatchlings of some forms, but\r\nin most large females the pattern is usually reduced to a near-uniform\r\ncoloration; the pattern on adult males of _ferox_ and _muticus_ is not\r\ncontrasting and resembles that on large females.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coloration_\r\n\r\nBecause most specimens examined were preserved, the detection of\r\nsecondary sexual differences in coloration was difficult. There is one\r\ndifference in coloration between the sexes in the subspecies _T. s.\r\nemoryi_. Males from the Río Grande drainage, at least those from the\r\nBig Bend region of Texas, and southwestward in the Río Conchos into\r\nChihuahua, México, are bright orange on the side of head (postlabial\r\nand postocular pale areas); an orange tinge also occurs in pale\r\nstripes on the snout, and pale orange blotches sometimes occur on the\r\ndorsal surfaces of limbs, especially the hind limbs. The coloration of\r\nthese areas on females is pale yellow, lacking orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuberculation_\r\n\r\nIn all subspecies of _spinifer_ the carapace of adult males is\r\n\"sandpapery\" owing to abundant, small, spiny tubercles distributed\r\nover its surface; all females lack spiny tubercles on the surface of\r\nthe carapace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Length of Tail_\r\n\r\nElongation of the preanal region of the tail resulting in the\r\nextension of the cloacal opening beyond the posterior edge of the\r\ncarapace occurs in males of several kinds of turtles, including\r\n_Trionyx_, at least in those from Louisiana, Texas, and Lake Texoma,\r\nOklahoma (Webb, 1956:121). Probably this elongation is characteristic\r\nof males of all American softshells. Some females of _spinifer_ and\r\n_muticus_ that exceed the maximum size attained by males have the tip\r\nof the tail and cloacal opening extending a short distance beyond the\r\nposterior edge of the carapace. Some large females of _ferox_ have\r\nmore elongate tails than those of _spinifer_ and _muticus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Width of Alveolar Surfaces of Jaws_\r\n\r\nStejneger (1944:34-36, pl. 6) commented on a series of large skulls of\r\n_ferox_ mostly from Kissimmee, Florida, some of which had\r\nconspicuously expanded alveolar surfaces. He suggested that the\r\ncondition was confined to large males. A scattergram (Fig. 2) based on\r\nmeasurements obtained from 45 skulls of _ferox_ shows widened alveolar\r\nsurfaces of the upper jaws on some of the larger skulls. Because the\r\nmaximal size of adult males is unknown and the difference in size\r\nbetween the sexes of _ferox_ is slight, such large skulls might\r\nrepresent either sex. The sex had been recorded for only three of the\r\n45 skulls; none of the three exceeded 82 millimeters in basicranial\r\nlength or had widened alveolar surfaces. Some of the larger skulls of\r\napproximately the same size differ markedly in width of the alveolar\r\nsurfaces; this difference suggests that both sexes are included and\r\nthat the sexes may be of approximately the same maximal size. On the\r\nother hand, the variation observed in skulls is possibly confined to\r\none sex. To judge from what is known of the maximal sizes of the sexes\r\nof _spinifer_ and _muticus_ (see Table 2), skulls of _ferox_ of more\r\nthan 85 millimeters in basicranial length probably are of females. The\r\nlargest alcoholic male (dissected) of _ferox_ that I examined had a\r\nwidth of head of approximately 46.5 millimeters; that measurement\r\ncorresponds to a basicranial length of 70 to 75 millimeters. The\r\nspecimen of which measurements are depicted by the uppermost symbol in\r\nthe scattergram (represented by KU 16528) was recorded as a female.\r\nLarge females of _T. s. asper_ from rivers emptying into the Atlantic\r\nOcean have broadened alveolar surfaces.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Basicranial length and greatest width of\r\n       alveolar surface of upper jaw on 45 skulls of _T. ferox_. Some\r\n       skulls (sex unknown) in which the basicranial length exceeds\r\n       85 mm. develop widened alveolar surfaces of the jaws.]\r\n\r\n_Length of Claw_\r\n\r\nSecondary sexual differences in length of claw on the forelimb are\r\npronounced in some kinds of turtles. Cahn (1937:178) stated that the\r\nfemale of _Trionyx muticus_ usually has long claws on the hind feet,\r\nwhile the male has long claws on the forefeet, but I am unable to\r\nsubstantiate his statement. Measurements of length of the third claw\r\non the hind limb taken in 41 males and 45 females of _spinifer_ from\r\nLouisiana showed no secondary sexual difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nOntogenetic Variation\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern_\r\n\r\nIn all species and subspecies the juvenal pattern is replaced in\r\nfemales as growth proceeds by a mottled and blotched pattern that is\r\ncontrasting or of nearly uniform coloration. The blotched pattern (of\r\nlichenlike figures) is evident on the carapaces of most females that\r\nhave plastra so long as 8.0 centimeters. The contrasting juvenal\r\npattern on the dorsal surfaces of the soft parts of the body is\r\ncorrespondingly modified in females, but at a size larger than 8.0\r\ncentimeters. Size of ocelli (OD/PL) in _T. s. spinifer_ and _hartwegi_\r\nseems to vary ontogenetically (see section on Geographic Variation).\r\n\r\nSome hatchlings have blotched patterns (_T. spinifer asper_, TU\r\n16689.2, plastral length, 3.5 cm.); the largest females examined that\r\ndid not show any evidence of mottling were two _asper_ having\r\nplastrons 7.6 and 8.0 centimeters in length. Variation in color and\r\npattern probably is modified greatly by the environment (Heude _in_\r\nStejneger, 1907:518, footnote d) and the physiological condition of\r\nthe individual. Smith, Nixon and Minton (1949:92) reported that a\r\nfemale of _T. s. hartwegi_ developed a striking melanistic pattern in\r\ncaptivity and they concluded that patterns of soft-shelled turtles may\r\nbe produced not only by conventional chromatophores, but also by other\r\ndepositions, both intra- and extracellular. TU 16170, taken from\r\nbrackish water at Delacroix Island, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, is\r\nthe only adult male I have seen that had a blotched pattern\r\n(orange-brown in life) on the carapace in addition to the juvenal\r\npattern. One female of _muticus_, KU 48229, having a plastral length\r\n14.5 centimeters, retained a well-defined juvenal pattern, and lacked\r\na mottled and blotched pattern (see Pl. 46).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuberculation_\r\n\r\nMales of the subspecies of _spinifer_ develop small, sharp tubercles\r\non the dorsal surface of the carapace when sexually mature. As growth\r\nproceeds, the minute prominences along the anterior edge of the\r\ncarapace on hatchlings of both sexes of _spinifer_ change in shape to\r\nconical projections or low, flattened, scarcely-elevated prominences,\r\ndepending on the subspecies (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nLarge females of _spinifer_ and _ferox_ acquire enlarged, flattened\r\nknobs in the nuchal region and posteriorly in the center of the\r\ncarapace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Length of Tail_\r\n\r\nThe preanal region of the tail rapidly elongates in males of all\r\nsoft-shells when they are sexually mature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Width of Alveolar Surfaces of Jaws_\r\n\r\nThe alveolar surfaces of the jaws are conspicuously broadened in large\r\nadults of _ferox_, and females of that population of _T. s. asper_ in\r\nthe Atlantic Coast drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ratios_\r\n\r\nWidth of head increases at a rate slightly slower than does the length\r\nof the plastron (PL/HW, Fig. 3). The change in proportions is most\r\npronounced at a plastral length of 7.5 to 8.0 centimeters. In\r\ngeneral, the head is narrowest in _muticus_ and widest in _ferox_. _T.\r\ns. asper_ and _emoryi_ seemingly have the widest heads among the\r\nsubspecies of _spinifer_. Geographically width of head increases from\r\n_spinifer_ and _hartwegi_ through _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_ to\r\n_emoryi_. _T. ater_ terminates the cline; 12 specimens, ranging in\r\nplastral length from 9.6 to 18.4 centimeters, resemble _ferox_ and\r\n_asper_ in having wide heads (average PL/HW of 4.93).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Ratio of length of plastron to width of head\r\n       (PL/HW) in some American species and subspecies of the genus\r\n       _Trionyx_. The size of each sample is given in parentheses\r\n       following an indication of the range (< = less than, > = greater\r\n       than) in length of plastron (in cm.) of each sample. The horizontal\r\n       line indicates the observed variation; the vertical line, the mean;\r\n       the white rectangle, four standard deviations; and the black\r\n       rectangle, four standard errors of the mean. There is some\r\n       ontogenetic variation in PL/HW. The head is narrowest in _muticus_\r\n       and widest in _ferox_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carapace increases in width more slowly than it increases in\r\nlength (CL/CW, Fig. 4). The change in proportions is most pronounced\r\nwhen the carapace is 8.0 to 8.5 centimeters in length. Ontogenetically\r\n_muticus_ varies least and _ferox_ most; large specimens of _ferox_\r\nhave narrower carapaces than _muticus_ of corresponding size. There is\r\nalso an indication of a geographical gradient that parallels the cline\r\nmentioned above for PL/HW. There is a gradual decrease in width of\r\ncarapace from _pallidus_ through _guadalupensis_ to _emoryi_. Of the\r\nsubspecies of _spinifer_, _emoryi_ has the narrowest carapace and\r\nresembles _ferox_. In _T. ater_ this cline is accentuated and\r\nterminates; 12 specimens, ranging in plastral length from 9.6 to 18.4\r\ncentimeters, resemble _ferox_ and _emoryi_ in having narrow carapaces\r\n(average CL/CW of 1.32).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters_\r\n\r\nClosure of the anterior, paravertebral fontanelles on the bony\r\ncarapace, and size and number of plastral callosities are subject to\r\nontogenetic variation (see sections entitled \"Carapace\" and\r\n\"Plastron\").\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Ratio of length of carapace to width of\r\n       carapace (CL/CW) in some American species and subspecies of the\r\n       genus _Trionyx_. Symbols as in Fig. 3. There is some ontogenetic\r\n       variation in CL/CW (least in _muticus_).

In the subspecies of\r\n_spinifer_ there is both group variation and clinal variation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup Variation\r\n\r\nThe six subspecies of _spinifer_ can be separated into two groups on\r\nthe basis of the juvenal pattern. One group (subspecies _spinifer_,\r\n_hartwegi_ and _asper_) has a pattern of dark spots or ocelli of\r\nvarious sizes on the carapace, whereas the other group (subspecies\r\n_pallidus_, _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_) has a pattern of small white\r\ndots or tubercles on the carapace. The two groups differ also in the\r\nmanner in which the mottled and blotched pattern first appears on the\r\ncarapace of females. Usually, contrasting lichenlike figures initially\r\nsurround the dark spots or ocelli on the carapace in females of the\r\n_spinifer_ group (less evident in _pallidus_), whereas females of the\r\n_emoryi_ group usually lack a contrasting pattern early in ontogeny.\r\nIn general, the two groups differ in the degree of pigmentation. The\r\n_spinifer_ group has larger marks and more contrasting patterns on the\r\nhead and limbs, and more extensive pigmentation on the ventral surface\r\nthan members of the _emoryi_ group. _T. ater_ is more closely related\r\nto those subspecies of the _emoryi_ group but differs in having the\r\nventral surface heavily speckled with black and an over-all blackish,\r\ndorsal coloration; the underlying pattern of _ater_ resembles that of\r\n_emoryi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nClinal Variation\r\n\r\nSeveral characters are arranged in a geographical gradient or cline.\r\nSome characters are relatively uniform and represent a terminus in the\r\n_spinifer_ group. Some characters change gradually and successively\r\nthrough the subspecies _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_, and terminate\r\nin _emoryi_ and _T. ater_. Some characters of _ater_, in turn, show\r\naffinity with _T. muticus_ and _T. ferox_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Snout_\r\n\r\nThe pattern (Fig. 5) on the snout usually consists of pale,\r\ndark-bordered stripes that form an acute angle in front of the eyes in\r\n_spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_, but the corresponding marks form a\r\ndark triangle the base line of which joins the anterior margins of the\r\norbits in _emoryi_ and usually in _guadalupensis_. In _pallidus_, the\r\ngeographic range of which is between _guadalupensis_ and _hartwegi_,\r\nthere are different patterns that are in various degrees intermediate\r\nbetween those described immediately above for _hartwegi_ and\r\n_guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Side of Head_\r\n\r\nThe change in pattern (Fig. 6) and its contrast with the ground color\r\non the side of the head parallels the sequence of changes in pattern\r\non the snout. The pattern on the side of head contrasts with the\r\nground color and consists of dark markings below the eye and on the\r\nneck, an indication of a postlabial stripe, and a pale, dark-bordered\r\npostocular stripe that may be variously interrupted (_spinifer_ and\r\n_hartwegi_; _asper_ usually has uninterrupted postocular and\r\npostlabial stripes that unite on the side of the head). The pattern is\r\ncontrasting but variable in _pallidus_. _T. s. emoryi_ and usually\r\n_guadalupensis_ have fewer dark markings, sometimes none, and an\r\ninterrupted postocular pale stripe that produces a pale blotch just\r\nbehind the eye.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 6.

The change is gradual from larger\r\nand darker markings (contrasting pattern) in _hartwegi_, _spinifer_\r\nand _asper_ to smaller and paler markings (non-contrasting pattern) in\r\n_emoryi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuberculation_\r\n\r\nThere is also a cline in tuberculation (Fig. 8) that parallels\r\ngeographically the sequence of changes in patterns mentioned\r\nimmediately above. The size of the tubercles along the anterior edge\r\nof the carapace changes in both sexes from those that are enlarged and\r\nequilateral or conical in shape in _spinifer_, _hartwegi_, _asper_ and\r\n_pallidus_ to those that are scarcely elevated in _guadalupensis_,\r\n_emoryi_ and _T. ater_. Indeed, in the three kinds mentioned last, the\r\ntubercles are absent in some specimens. There seems to be a\r\ncorresponding reduction in the size and number of small, sharp-tipped\r\ntubercles that cover the carapace in adult males; the carapace of _T.\r\nater_ is mostly smooth and has only a few small, whitish tubercles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Anteroposterior position of plane of\r\n       greatest width of carapace (CL/PCW) in some American species\r\n       and subspecies of the genus _Trionyx_. Symbols as in Fig. 3.\r\n       The greatest width of carapace is midway between anterior and\r\n       posterior ends in _ferox_, _spinifer_, _hartwegi_, _asper_ and\r\n       _muticus_, and farther posterior in the other subspecies of\r\n       _spinifer_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ratios_\r\n\r\nThe clinal tendencies in PL/HW (Fig. 3) and CL/CW (Fig. 4) that\r\nparallel those mentioned above for pattern and tuberculation have\r\nalready been mentioned under the section \"Ontogenetic Variation.\"\r\n\r\nThe ratio of CL/PCW (Fig. 9) was used in an effort to show further\r\ndifferences in the shape of the carapace, especially the plane on the\r\ncarapace where the greatest width occurs. Figure 9 shows the greatest\r\nwidth to be approximately midway between the anterior and posterior\r\nends in the subspecies _spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_, and in the\r\nspecies _ferox_ and _muticus_ (CL/PCW of 2.00). The greatest width of\r\ncarapace is more posterior and at approximately the same plane in\r\n_pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_, and farther posterior in _emoryi_.\r\nCalculated ratios for 12 specimens of _T. ater_ average 2.15, a value\r\nthat suggests closer affinity with _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_ and\r\n_emoryi_ than to the other species and subspecies.\r\n\r\nComparison of the relative lengths of snout (HW/SL, Fig. 10) in\r\ndifferent populations of _T. spinifer_ shows a character gradient. To\r\nfacilitate a comparison utilizing large samples, the subspecies\r\n_spinifer_ was combined with _hartwegi_, and _pallidus_ with\r\n_guadalupensis_. The snout is longer in the subspecies _spinifer_ and\r\n_hartwegi_ than in _emoryi_; the length of the snout of _emoryi_\r\nresembles that of _T. ferox_. The snout is proportionately the longest\r\nin _T. muticus_. The average ratio of HW/SL for 12 individuals of _T.\r\nater_ is 1.37, and is nearer that of _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_,\r\n_emoryi_ and _ferox_ than that of _muticus_ or the other subspecies of\r\n_T. spinifer_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 10. Ratio of width of head to length of snout\r\n       (HW/SL) in some American species and subspecies of the genus\r\n       _Trionyx_. Symbols as in Fig. 3. Values for _spinifer_ are\r\n       combined with those of _hartwegi_, and those of _pallidus_\r\n       with _guadalupensis_. The snout is proportionately the\r\n       longest in _muticus_.]\r\n\r\nSize of the ocelli increases from west to east in populations of _T.\r\nspinifer_ in the upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes drainages.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of OD/PL (Fig. 11) varies considerably but gradually\r\nincreases from Kansas northeastward to Michigan. The minimal diameter\r\nof any ocellus recorded was one millimeter; solid dots on the carapace\r\n(_hartwegi_) were also recorded as one millimeter. Larger ratios are\r\nusually derived from measurements of larger individuals. Seemingly,\r\nthere should be a clinal tendency in ontogenetic variation paralleling\r\nthe size of ocelli and dependent on it; ontogenetic variation should\r\nbe least in western populations in which the size of ocelli does not\r\nchange appreciably with increasing size, and should be greatest in\r\neastern populations in which the ocelli on adult males are larger than\r\nthose on the carapace of young turtles. It is difficult to\r\ndemonstrate ontogenetic variation because specimens of corresponding\r\nsize from the same general area may have ocelli of different sizes.\r\nThe gradient in size of ocelli is also indicated by specimens from\r\nother states. I have the subjective impression that there is least\r\nvariation in specimens from Michigan (Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River\r\ndrainage), but this is not clearly shown by Figure 11.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Ratio of diameter of ocellus to length of\r\n       plastron (OD/PL) in _T. spinifer_ from some states in the upper\r\n       Mississippi River and Great Lakes drainages.

The size of the ocelli on the carapace gradually\r\n       increases from Kansas northeastward to Michigan.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snout_\r\n\r\nThe snout (Fig. 12) is tubate having terminal nostrils separated by a\r\nvertical septum. One of the principal characters distinguishing _T.\r\nferox_ and _T. spinifer_ from _T. muticus_ is a lateral, whitish ridge\r\nprojecting from each side of the nasal septum (hereafter referred to\r\nas septal ridges but often referred to in the literature as a\r\npapilla). The shape of the end of the snout is truncate in _T. ferox_\r\nand _T. spinifer_, and the nostrils are larger than in _T. muticus_.\r\nIn _muticus_ the snout usually terminates somewhat obliquely, and the\r\nnostrils tend to be slightly inferior; also, the end of the snout is\r\nusually rounded and somewhat pointed, causing the nostrils to be\r\nvisible in lateral view. Some _T. muticus_ do not differ markedly from\r\n_ferox_ or _spinifer_ in shape of the end of the snout. Stejneger\r\n(1944:14) mentioned indication of a septal ridge that did not reach\r\nthe opening of the nostril in _muticus_. I have slit the outer edge of\r\nthe nostril on several specimens of _muticus_, and have not noticed an\r\nindication of a septal ridge.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 12. Shape of snout in _T. spinifer_ (left, a-d,\r\n       from KU 46907) and _T. muticus_ (right, e-h, from KU 48236).\r\n       Lateral views--a, e (× 1); anterior views--b, f (× 5); dorsal\r\n       views--c, g (× 2.5); ventral views--d, h (× 2.5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuberculation_\r\n\r\nTubercles or obtuse prominences occur on the anterior edge of the\r\ncarapace (Fig. 8) or on the dorsal surface of the carapace. _Trionyx\r\nmuticus_ lacks tubercles, although some individuals show shallow,\r\nwidely spaced wrinkles that suggest prominences on the anterior edge\r\nof the carapace. Both sexes of _T. ferox_ have prominences, resembling\r\nflattened hemispheres, on the anterior edge of the carapace and in the\r\nnuchal region. Large females of _ferox_ have obtuse prominences in the\r\ncenter of the carapace posteriorly, some of which are often arranged\r\nin longitudinal rows. The surface of the carapace in both sexes of _T.\r\nferox_ has small closely-set, blunt tubercles arranged in rows that\r\nresemble longitudinal ridges (most evident in juveniles).\r\n\r\nLarge females of _T. spinifer_ have obtuse prominences in the center\r\nof the carapace posteriorly, some of which in many specimens are\r\narranged in longitudinal rows; I cannot discern any correlation of\r\nnumber or arrangement of prominences with size in _spinifer_ or\r\n_ferox_. The carapace in adult males of _spinifer_ bears small, sharp\r\ntubercles that make the surface feel like sandpaper. The tubercles on\r\nthe anterior edge of the carapace in adults of both sexes vary from\r\nround to equilateral and conical to low and flattened (see comments on\r\ntuberculation under subsection entitled \"Geographic Variation\"). Some\r\nlarge females of the same subspecies have tubercles on the anterior\r\nedge of the carapace that may be conical (higher than wide) or\r\nequilateral. The difference in shape of the tubercles seems not to be\r\ncorrelated with size because one _T. s. pallidus_, 30.5 centimeters\r\n(TU 13212) has prominent but blunted and equilateral tubercles,\r\nwhereas, another female of _pallidus_, 20.8 centimeters (TU 13210),\r\nfrom the same locality has higher, conical tubercles. The blunted,\r\nequilateral tubercles may be the result of environmental wear, or the\r\ndifference in shape of tubercles may be due to individual variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Carapace_\r\n\r\nTwo features of the pattern on the carapace are of taxonomic worth: 1)\r\nthe width and distinctness of the pale rim at the periphery of the\r\ncarapace (marginal rim), if present, and 2) the kind of pattern on the\r\ncarapace (juvenal pattern). The marginal rim is absent in females of\r\n_T. ater_, and only faintly evident in males. The marginal rim is\r\nobscured or absent (adult males and females) and is not separated from\r\nthe ground color of the carapace by a dark marginal line in hatchlings\r\nof _T. ferox_. The carapace of _T. muticus_ has a marginal rim that is\r\nusually separated from the ground color of the carapace by an\r\nill-defined, dark marginal line; some individuals lack the marginal\r\ndark line. The subspecies of _T. spinifer_ have a well-defined, dark,\r\nmarginal line that separates the marginal rim from the ground color of\r\nthe carapace; _T. s. asper_ has more than one dark marginal line on\r\nthe carapace. The marginal rim is ill-defined and blotched, or absent,\r\nin large females of all species of _Trionyx_.\r\n\r\nThe marginal rim is widest at the posterior end of the carapace and\r\nlacking in the nuchal area. The width of the pale marginal rim is very\r\nnarrow, almost to the degree of being absent, in juveniles of _T.\r\nferox_. _T. s. emoryi_ has a pale, marginal rim that is four or five\r\ntimes wider posteriorly than it is laterally, whereas posteriorly the\r\nwidth of the rim in the other subspecies of _T. spinifer_ and in the\r\nspecies _T. muticus_ is only two or three times wider posteriorly than\r\nit is laterally.\r\n\r\nThe juvenal pattern commonly consists of whitish tubercles or dots\r\n(_T. s. emoryi_, _T. s. guadalupensis_, _T. s. pallidus_, _T. ater_),\r\nlarge black ocelli (_T. s. spinifer_), small black dots and ocelli\r\n(_T. s. hartwegi_, _T. s. asper_), large dusky spots or ocelli (_T. m.\r\ncalvatus_), or small dusky dots or short streaks and dashes (_T. m.\r\nmuticus_). Some hatchlings of _pallidus_ and _emoryi_ have a uniform\r\npale brown or tan carapace; hatchlings of _T. ferox_ have a\r\ndistinctive pattern (Pl. 31). Further comments and illustrations\r\npertaining to kind of pattern on the carapace are offered under the\r\naccounts of species and subspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Dorsal Surface of Snout (Fig. 5)_\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ has pale stripes on a dark background that unite in front\r\nof the eyes; the dark ground color becomes paler with increasing size,\r\nbut the stripes retain thick black borders. _T. m. muticus_ has\r\nill-defined, pale stripes that are evident just in front of the eyes\r\nand do not extend anteriorly to unite in front of the eyes, whereas\r\n_T. m. calvatus_ lacks pale stripes on the snout. The kind of pattern\r\non the dorsal surface of the snout that is characteristic for each of\r\nthe subspecies of _T. spinifer_ has been mentioned in the discussion\r\nof clinal variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Side of Head (Fig. 6)_\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ has a pale broad, postocular stripe in contact with the\r\norbit or not, and other pale marks on a dark background; the ground\r\ncolor becomes paler with increasing size, but the stripes and other\r\nmarks retain thick black borders. _T. m. muticus_ usually has an\r\nuninterrupted, dusky-bordered, postocular stripe, whereas _T. m.\r\ncalvatus_ (in adult males only) has pale postocular stripes with thick\r\nblackish borders. The pattern on the side of head that is\r\ncharacteristic for each subspecies of _T. spinifer_ has been mentioned\r\nin the discussion of clinal variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pattern on Dorsal Surface of Limbs (Fig. 7)_\r\n\r\nYoung specimens of _T. ferox_ have pale marks on a blackish\r\nbackground. As growth proceeds the distinctive contrasting pattern is\r\nobliterated and eventually is replaced by a uniform grayish coloration\r\nin large adults. The pattern on the limbs of _T. muticus_ is not\r\ncontrasting, and is almost a uniform grayish, consisting of fine, pale\r\nmarkings. The clinal variation in pattern and kind of pattern on the\r\nlimbs of the subspecies of _T. spinifer_ has been mentioned in the\r\ndiscussion of clinal variation. Dark markings tend to form streaks\r\nthat are coincident with the digits, and larger markings occur on the\r\nhind limbs than on the forelimbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marginal Ridge_\r\n\r\nThe anterolateral edge of the carapace in _T. ferox_ (both sexes and\r\nall sizes) is \"folded over\" into a ridge having a distinct inner\r\nmargin (Pls. 1 and 2), which is hereafter referred to as the marginal\r\nridge. Siebenrock (1924:184-85) referred to this ridge as a\r\n\"Hautsäume\" and mentioned its occurrence in Old World species of the\r\ngenus _Trionyx_. The marginal ridge is not present in _T. muticus_,\r\n_T. spinifer_ or _T. ater_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ratios_\r\n\r\nThe means of some samples (Fig. 3) differ in regard to PL/HW, but the\r\nranges of variation overlap so much that little significance can be\r\nattributed to the difference. _T. ferox_, and to a lesser extent _T.\r\ns. emoryi_ and _T. s. asper_, have slightly larger heads than the\r\nother forms. The width of head is proportionately the smallest in _T.\r\nmuticus_; in most individuals of it having a plastron so long as 13.0\r\ncentimeters, the width of the head is less than 16 per cent of the\r\nlength of the plastron--a percentage that is distinctive.\r\n\r\nThe visibly narrower carapace (CL/CW, Fig. 4), suggesting an ovoid or\r\noblong shape, in some large individuals of _T. ferox_ and _T. s.\r\nemoryi_ is indicated by the large ratio in specimens that have a\r\nplastral length of 8.0 centimeters or more. Nevertheless, the degree\r\nof overlap of the ranges of variation is such that this ratio is of\r\nrelatively little use taxonomically.\r\n\r\nThe greatest width of the carapace is farther posterior in _T. s.\r\nemoryi_ than in the other forms (CL/PCW, Fig. 9). The considerable\r\noverlap of the range of variation of this ratio for _emoryi_ with the\r\nother forms limits its usefulness as a taxonomic character.\r\n\r\nThe snout is proportionately shortest in _ferox_ and _T. s. emoryi_,\r\nand longest in _muticus_ (HW/SL, Fig. 10). The most marked difference\r\nin this ratio is between the species _muticus_ and _ferox_; the ranges\r\nof variation of those species overlap to a degree that tends to negate\r\nthe taxonomic usefulness of this character.\r\n\r\nMost adults and subadults of _T. ferox_ show clearly in dorsal view\r\nthe anterolateral portions of the plastron. This condition is much\r\nless well developed in some specimens of _T. s. emoryi_. _T. ferox_ is\r\nextreme in the ratio CL/PL (relatively the longest plastron or\r\nshortest carapace, Fig. 13). _T. s. asper_ has the shortest plastron\r\nin relation to length of carapace. Calculated ratios for 12 _T. ater_\r\naverage 1.36, a value that suggests close affinity with some\r\nsubspecies of _T. spinifer_ (_pallidus_, _guadalupensis_, _emoryi_).\r\nBecause of the degree of overlap of the ranges of variation in all\r\nforms, little significance can be attributed to the difference in\r\nmeans of _ferox_ and _asper_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 13. Ratio of length of carapace to length of\r\n       plastron (CL/PL) in some American species and subspecies of\r\n       the genus _Trionyx_. Symbols as in Fig. 3. _T. ferox_ has\r\n       proportionately the shortest carapace.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scalation_\r\n\r\nCornified, smooth or cusplike areas occur on each limb, but their\r\nnumber and arrangement are of no taxonomic value. Normally, the\r\nanterior surface of each forelimb possesses four cornified areas for\r\nwhich the term antebrachial scales is proposed (Fig. 14). Two of the\r\nfour scales occur in a more dorsal position; the lateral edge of the\r\nproximal one is free and cusplike along a part of its length, whereas\r\nthe distal scale is smooth-edged. Two scales having their lateral\r\nedges free and cusplike are ventral in position, and closer together\r\nthan the two dorsad scales. Size of the scales and length of the free\r\ncusplike edges vary. Occasionally adjacent scales are fused or small\r\nadditional scales are present. The number, configuration and\r\narrangement of the two cornified areas on each hind limb are constant.\r\nOne of these scales is smooth-edged and occurs posteriorly on the\r\ndorsal surface. The other scale, situated on the ventral surface\r\nposteriorly in the region of the heel and distal to the smooth-edged\r\nscale of the dorsal surface, has a pronounced, cusplike, free edge.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14. Dorsal surface of right forelimb showing\r\n       normal number and arrangement of antebrachial scales in American\r\n       species of the genus _Trionyx_ (_T. spinifer hartwegi_,\r\n       KU 15932, × 3/4).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Choanal Papillae_\r\n\r\nThis term refers to the papillate flaps of skin that project from the\r\nlateral borders of the internal nares. Webb and Legler (1960:23) noted\r\ntheir presence in softshells, and Parsons (1958) discussed their\r\noccurrence in sea turtles of the family Cheloniidae and in the\r\ntestudinid subfamily Emydinae (1960). In preserved softshells the\r\nchoanal papillae may extend laterally and partly cover the nares, or\r\nmay be folded vertically against the lateral borders of the nares; in\r\nthe latter position the papillae are easily overlooked. To my\r\nknowledge, choanal papillae occur in all American species and\r\nsubspecies of soft-shelled turtles. The free edge of each narial flap\r\nshows various degrees of fimbriation. The fimbriated border is least\r\ndeveloped (margin nearly entire) in _T. muticus_ and most developed in\r\n_T. ater_ and _T. ferox_. In _ater_ at least, the anteriormost\r\nportions of the narial flaps seem wider than in the other forms and\r\nshow a greater degree of fimbriation than the posteriormost parts. The\r\nchoanal papillae are most easily observed in large specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skull_\r\n\r\nIn general, there is less difference between the skulls of _ferox_ and\r\n_spinifer_ than between either of those species and _muticus_\r\n(Stejneger, 1944:10-11). Figure 15 shows the general differences in\r\nproportions of the skulls of _spinifer_ and _muticus_; Plate 54 shows\r\nthe skull of the holotype of _Platypeltis agassizi_ (= _T. s. asper_),\r\nwhich is similar to that of _ferox_; Stejneger (_op. cit._) provided\r\nlabelled drawings of the skull of _T. spinifer_ as well as photographs\r\nof skulls of other forms.\r\n\r\nThe total of 159 skulls examined by me include 80 of _spinifer_, 50 of\r\n_ferox_, and 29 of _muticus_. There are no secondary sexual\r\ndifferences between skulls of corresponding size, except in\r\n_agassizi_-form skulls mentioned under the account of _T. s. asper_,\r\nand possibly in _ferox_. Most, and possibly all, of the skulls of\r\n_muticus_ having a basicranial length of 40.0 millimeters or more, and\r\nthose of _spinifer_ exceeding 50.0 millimeters must represent females\r\n(by correlation of known maximum size of males with greatest width of\r\nhead, which is, in turn, compared with the greatest width of skull and\r\ncorresponding basicranial length).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 15.

One ratio developed from the\r\nmeasurements was greatest length of internal choanae/least breadth of\r\nmaxillary bridge, hereafter referred to as IC/MB. This ratio is\r\ndiscussed under the account of _T. s. asper_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greatest Width_\r\n\r\nThe position or level on the skull where the greatest width (Table 3)\r\noccurs is of some diagnostic value in distinguishing the skulls of\r\n_ferox_ from _spinifer_ and _muticus_. Skulls of _ferox_ usually are\r\nwidest at the level of the quadratojugal (immediately in front of\r\ntympanic cavity), whereas skulls of _spinifer_ and _muticus_ usually\r\nare widest slightly more posteriorly at a level on the squamosal\r\nimmediately behind the tympanic cavity. Occasionally the width at the\r\nlevel of the quadratojugal and squamosal is the same, or the greatest\r\nwidth of skull may be ventrad between the quadrates, which are\r\nslightly flared laterally. The latter condition possibly is most\r\nprevalent in _muticus_.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 3.

The ventral surface of the supraoccipital\r\nspine, which is widest proximally in _muticus_, is always narrow\r\nproximally in _ferox_ and _spinifer_. The ventral surface of the\r\nsupraoccipital spine of one skull of _spinifer_, USNM 91311, differs\r\nlittle from that of _muticus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foramen Magnum_\r\n\r\nThe shape of the foramen magnum is generally rhomboidal in _spinifer_\r\nand _ferox_; the ventral angle is semicircular, the lateral angles\r\nobtuse, and the dorsal angle more acute. The shape of the foramen\r\nmagnum in _muticus_ is ovoid, higher than wide; the sides are evenly\r\nrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opisthotic-Exoccipital Spur_\r\n\r\nSkulls of _spinifer_ normally have the fenestra postotica partly\r\nrestricted by a medially-slanting, descending spur from the roof of\r\nthe fenestra postotica; the spur incorporates the suture between the\r\nexoccipital and opisthotic and includes parts of those two bones. On\r\none skull (KU 2824) the spur is displaced more medially and does not\r\nincorporate the opisthotic. The descending spur contacts the pterygoid\r\nventrally forming a complete bony strut traversing the fenestra\r\npostotica in some skulls (KU 2228, 2666, 2762, TU 15423, MCZ 46621, TU\r\n15415, right side only). The fenestra postotica on skulls of _ferox_\r\nand especially _muticus_ is not normally restricted by an\r\nopisthotic-exoccipital spur.\r\n\r\nOften the spur is reduced and indicated by a smooth projecting ridge.\r\nSometimes the spur or ridge is absent on skulls of _spinifer_, and I\r\nhave seen no well-developed spur on a skull of _muticus_. The\r\ndevelopment of the spur is not due to ontogenetic variation. There is\r\nsome variation in development of the spur on either side of the skull;\r\ntwo skulls of _ferox_ have the combination ridge/absent, and two of\r\n_spinifer_ have the combinations ridge/spur and spur/absent. The\r\nfrequency (based on counts of individual skulls) and the degree of\r\ndevelopment of the spur among the three species is indicated in Table\r\n4.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 4.

I have not seen an\r\nascending process of the pterygoids on skulls of American softshells\r\nas described by Loveridge and Williams (_op. cit._:414, 429, fig. 54)\r\nfor _Lissemys_, _Cyclanorbis_, _Cycloderma_ and some _Trionyx\r\ntriunguis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opisthotic Wing_\r\n\r\nThis term refers to the laterally directed, posterior part of the\r\nopisthotic that is visible in occipital, lateral and ventral views. In\r\nventral view the opisthotic wing is most easily seen and is wider in\r\n_muticus_ than in _spinifer_ or _ferox_. In _muticus_ the distal part\r\nis truncate, whereas in _ferox_ and _spinifer_, it is more tapered and\r\ngently rounded, although somewhat unevenly flared medially. Also\r\nthere is more of a downward curvature (in ventral view) of the\r\nopisthotic wing in _muticus_ than in _ferox_ or _spinifer_;\r\nconsequently the tip of the wing in _muticus_ is often just visible in\r\ndorsal view (on lateral side of squamosal), certainly in lateral view.\r\nThe distal part or tip of the opisthotic wing is not visible in dorsal\r\nview on skulls of _ferox_ or _spinifer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Articular Surface of Quadrate_\r\n\r\nThe ventral surface of the quadrate that articulates with the mandible\r\nis composed of a lateral condyle and a medial articular surface. The\r\ncondyle and medial articular surface are separated by a furrow. On\r\nskulls of _ferox_ and _spinifer_ the lateral condyle, which is not\r\nconspicuously tapered posteriorly, is slightly larger than the medial\r\narticular surface, and the furrow is shallow. On skulls of _muticus_,\r\nthe lateral condyle is conspicuously tapered posteriorly, is slightly\r\nsmaller than the medial articular surface, and the furrow is deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contact of Maxillaries Above Premaxillaries_\r\n\r\nThe contact of the maxillaries above the premaxillaries is of\r\ndiagnostic value in distinguishing skulls of _ferox_ and _spinifer_\r\nfrom those of _muticus_. I have seen no skulls of _muticus_ on which\r\nthe maxillaries were in contact, and no skulls of _ferox_ on which the\r\nmaxillaries were separated. Stejneger (1944:19), however, reported a\r\nskull of _muticus_ (USNM 102677) having the maxillaries in contact.\r\nMaxillaries are in contact (sometimes just barely) in 65 of 74 skulls\r\nof _spinifer_ (88%); the premaxillaries are separated on nine skulls\r\n(12%).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carapace_\r\n\r\nThe dorsal surface of the bony carapace of American trionychids\r\nconsists of a nuchal, seven or eight pairs of pleurals, and seven or\r\neight, rarely nine, neurals (Fig. 16). The lateral parts of the nuchal\r\noverlie the second pair of ribs. The distal parts of the second\r\nthrough the ninth pair of ribs extend laterally beyond the lateral\r\nedges of the pleurals. There are no marginal ossifications. The\r\nposterior part of the bony carapace bears blunt, rounded or ovoid to\r\nlinear, prominences mostly on the last pair of pleurals principally on\r\nlarge females of _spinifer_ and _ferox_; I have seen only one adult\r\nmale (stuffed, MCZ 46633) having a semblance of welts on the bony\r\ncarapace. The nuchal, pleurals and neurals are sculptured.\r\n\r\nAs growth proceeds, the single, transversely-oriented, fontanelle of\r\nyoung turtles that separates the nuchal from the first neural and\r\nfirst pair of pleurals divides into two fontanelles that generally\r\ndecrease in size and finally disappear. Occasionally only one\r\n(unilateral) large fontanelle is present (USNM 54734, _muticus_). The\r\nlargest specimens noted that retain fontanelles are a _ferox_ (USNM\r\n029474) having a plastron 24 centimeters long, and a _spinifer_ (USNM\r\n54731) having a plastron 20 centimeters long. The fontanelles probably\r\nare present in some larger individuals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 16.

M. Smith, 1947:121, table; Stejneger,\r\n1944:18). Table 5 shows the frequency of occurrence of the number of\r\nneurals, pairs of pleurals, and the separation or contact of the seventh\r\npair of pleurals; figure 16 illustrates some of the configurations of\r\nthese plates posteriorly (e, g, and i not included in Table 5). The\r\neighth pair of pleurals is reduced or absent (Loveridge and Williams,\r\n1957:417). Eight neurals and eight pairs of pleurals occur in all three\r\nspecies. The seventh pleurals may contact each other in all three\r\nspecies, and their separation has been observed only in the species\r\n_spinifer_ and _muticus_. Seven neurals and contact of the seventh pair\r\nof pleurals, or eight neurals and separation of the seventh pair of\r\npleurals from each other occurs with approximately equal frequency in\r\nthe species _muticus_. _T. ferox_ and _spinifer_ most often have seven\r\nneurals, seven pairs of pleurals, and the seventh pair of pleurals in\r\ncontact. Stejneger (_loc. cit._) mentioned a specimen in MCZ having nine\r\nneurals; I recorded nine neurals for USNM 54734 (Fig. 16i) for which\r\nStejneger (_loc. cit._) recorded eight. AMNH 57384 (_ferox_) has a small\r\neighth pleural on the left side only, and USNM 115939 (_muticus_) has an\r\neighth pleural only on the right side (Fig. 16h). Anomalous conditions\r\nobserved included: an accessory bone between the first and second\r\npleurals on the right side that contacts the first and second neurals in\r\nUSNM 54733, (_muticus_); only six neurals in USNM 95193 (_spinifer_); a\r\nsmall accessory bony element between the first and second neurals in\r\nAMNH 57383 (_ferox_); and, only six pleurals (second and third fused) on\r\nthe right side in USNM 54734 (_muticus_).\r\n\r\n    TABLE 5.

The ribs of the first thoracic vertebra\r\nare represented by bony struts that extend posterolaterally and\r\ncontact the anterior borders of the second pair of ribs. The two ribs\r\nof the ninth pair are free for most of their length and often are\r\nbroken; they are slightly shorter than the eighth pair of ribs. The\r\nribs of the tenth thoracic vertebra may be well-developed (KU 2219,\r\n2666, 50856, _spinifer_, and 16528, _ferox_), but are usually broken\r\noff and represented only by transverse processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nKyphosis\r\n\r\nKyphosis (angular curvature of the vertebral column) or the\r\nhump-backed condition in American softshell turtles has been\r\nsummarized by Nixon and Smith (1949:28). Cahn (1937:185, pl. 25e)\r\nillustrated the condition in an individual of _T. spinifer_, and H.\r\nM. Smith (1947:119) mentioned kyphotic softshells representing the\r\nspecies _spinifer_ (subspecies _hartwegi_ and _emoryi_) and _muticus_.\r\nNeill (1951:10) mentioned two kyphotic _T. s. asper_ and Nixon and\r\nSmith (_loc. cit._) recorded the report of a kyphotic _T. ferox_. I\r\nhave noted the condition in four _muticus_ (subspecies _muticus_, KU\r\n1959-60, 23230; INHS 2148) and seven _spinifer_ (CNHM 22925;\r\nsubspecies _hartwegi_, USNM 55689; subspecies _spinifer_, UMMZ 52948,\r\n95615; subspecies _emoryi_, KU 2219, 33523, TU 16240). The smallest\r\nkyphotic specimen, a hatchling, TU 16240, has a plastral length of 3.5\r\ncentimeters. Kyphosis is to be expected in all kinds of softshells as\r\nare other abnormalities, such as albinism (reported for _Lissemys_ by\r\nD'Abreu, 1928, and partial albinism noted in _T. cartilagineus_ by\r\nMohr, 1929) or congenital absence of limbs (reported by Dutta, 1931,\r\nas occurring in the genera _Trionyx_ and _Lissemys_). The cause of\r\nkyphosis is not known. Smith (_op. cit._:120) suggested an abnormally\r\nearly fusion of the costals (= pleurals) with the ribs, and a\r\nsubsequent differential rate of growth between them and the vertebral\r\ncolumn as a hypothesis; Williams (1957:236) proposed that late\r\nretraction of the yolk mass, or retraction of an excessively large\r\nyolk mass may cause kyphosis. The cause of kyphosis may be of genetic\r\norigin or due to some environmental damage to the vertebral column\r\nprior to the cessation of growth. The variation in rate of growth of\r\nthe vertebral column may produce humps of different shapes and sizes.\r\nSome of the specimens noted above (UMMZ 52948, 95615) have the\r\ncarapace only slightly arched and are considered partly kyphotic.\r\nThere seem to be degrees of kyphosis, a fact that should be taken into\r\naccount in considering the occurrence of variation in greatest depth\r\nof shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlastron\r\n\r\nThe plastron is united to the carapace by ligamentous tissue and is\r\nsomewhat flexible anteriorly and posteriorly. Anteriorly the plastron\r\nis somewhat hingelike and may contact the anteriormost edge of the\r\ncarapace. The bony elements are reduced. There is usually a median\r\nvacuity, which is relatively smaller in larger specimens and may be\r\ndivided into two vacuities (a posteromedial and an anteromedial) by\r\nthe medial juxtaposition of the hyo-hypoplastra, especially in\r\n_muticus_. Williams and McDowell (1952) have recommended a change in\r\nnomenclature for some of the plastral bones on the basis of\r\nreinterpretation of their homologies. The nine plastral bones include:\r\nan anterior pair of preplastra (= epiplastra, _auct._); an unpaired,\r\nmedian bone, representing fused epiplastra (= entoplastron, _auct._),\r\nhereafter referred to as the epiplastron; a pair of hyoplastra; a pair\r\nof hypoplastra; and, posteriorly, a pair of xiphiplastra (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nSiebenrock's (1902) synopsis of living trionychids was based entirely\r\non plastral characters. He distinguished between _muticus_ and\r\n_spinifer_ principally by the shape of the epiplastron; _T. ferox_ was\r\nnot considered different from _spinifer_. The median angle formed by\r\nthe boomerang-shaped epiplastron is obtuse and somewhat greater than\r\n90 degrees in _muticus_ (Fig. 17a); the angle of the epiplastron in\r\n_spinifer_ and _ferox_ is smaller than in _muticus_ and forms an\r\napproximate right angle (Fig. 17b). Williams and McDowell (_op.\r\ncit._:277, Pl. 1, Fig. 3) presented an illustration of the anterior\r\nplastral elements of an adult _T. ferox_. Siebenrock provided\r\nillustrations of the plastrons of _muticus_ (_op. cit._:823, Fig. 5)\r\nand _spinifer_ (_op. cit._:830, Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17.

The\r\nfusion of these bones distinguishes the genera _Lissemys_, _Cyclanorbis_\r\nand _Cycloderma_ from _Trionyx_, _Pelochelys_, and _Chitra_ (Siebenrock,\r\n_op. cit._:815, 817; Loveridge and Williams, 1957:415). This character\r\nis also one of the criteria used by Hummel (1929: 768) in his erection\r\nof the two subfamilies Cyclanorbinae (= Lissemyinae) and Trionychinae.\r\nIn my examination of specimens this character, unfortunately, was not\r\ngiven full attention. I have noted the fusion of the hypoplastra and\r\nhyoplastra in KU 1878 (_muticus_, right side only), KU 2219 (kyphotic\r\n_spinifer_), KU 16528 (_ferox_) and KU 60121 (_ferox_). Dr. Ernest E.\r\nWilliams informs me in a letter of November 17, 1959, that of six\r\nspecimens of _ferox_ in the MCZ, the hyoplastra are fused with the\r\nhypoplastra in three (54689-90, 54686). I suspect that these bones in\r\nthe three American species of the genus _Trionyx_, especially in\r\n_ferox_, fuse more often than is supposed.\r\n\r\nIn _muticus_ the constricted part of the hyoplastron and hypoplastron is\r\nwider anteroposteriorly than in _spinifer_ or _ferox_ (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nThe three American species have on the hyoplastra, hypoplastra, and\r\nxiphiplastra well-developed callosities, which enlarge with increasing\r\nsize. The medial borders of the hyoplastral and hypoplastral callosities\r\nin larger specimens are rounded and closely approximated, often\r\ntouching, as do the callosities of each xiphiplastron; seemingly, the\r\ncallosities are relatively larger in _muticus_ than in _spinifer_ and\r\n_ferox_. I have seen one adult male _muticus_ (KU 41380) that lacked\r\nmedian fontanelles or vacuities owing to the contact of the plastral\r\nelements (as viewed through overlying skin, alcoholic specimen). The\r\nbony plastron (approximately 9 cm. in maximal length) of a small\r\n_muticus_ (KU 19460) resembles the plastron of larger individuals of\r\n_muticus_ in having well-developed hyoplastral and hypoplastral\r\ncallosities that are closely approximated medially. Large individuals of\r\n_muticus_ usually have small, ovoid callosities on the preplastra, and a\r\nwell-developed, angular callosity on the epiplastron (Fig. 17a).\r\nSiebenrock (_op. cit._:823) suggests that the presence of callosities on\r\nthe preplastra and epiplastron of _muticus_ is subject to individual\r\nvariation. I can not substantiate or dispute the supposition of Baur\r\n(1888:1122), Siebenrock (1924:193) and Stejneger (1944:12, 19) that the\r\ncallosities are larger in males of _muticus_ than in the females. Some\r\nindividuals of _spinifer_ have seven plastral callosities (KU 2842) as\r\ndoes _muticus_, but the callosities on the preplastra and epiplastron\r\nare less frequent and less well-developed in large specimens of\r\n_spinifer_ than in _muticus_. The small epiplastral callosity in\r\n_spinifer_ is located at the medial angle and does not extend\r\nposterolaterally to cover the entire surface of the epiplastron as it\r\nmay in _muticus_ (Fig. 17b). The epiplastron of a _spinifer_ (KU 2826)\r\nhas a medial callosity and another on the right posterolateral\r\nprojection; three separate callosities occur on the epiplastron of MCZ\r\n46615. The last specimen mentioned, a large, stuffed female, possesses a\r\nround, intercalary bone that tends to occlude the posteromedial vacuity.\r\nSeemingly, the callosity on the epiplastron appears prior to those on\r\nthe preplastra; I have not seen any plastra having callosities on the\r\npreplastra and lacking a callosity on the epiplastron. I have not noted\r\ncallosities on the preplastra or epiplastron of specimens of _ferox_.\r\n\r\nThe callosities on the plastral bones are sculptured; small, recently\r\nformed callosities on the preplastra and epiplastron lack sculpturing.\r\nThe pattern of sculpturing on the plastral bones as well as that of the\r\ncarapace is generally of anastamosing ridges. I am unable to discern any\r\ndifferences in pattern of sculpturing between the three American\r\nspecies. Stejneger distinguished adult specimens of _ferox_ from the\r\nother American species by the coarseness of the sculpture of the bony\r\ncallosities (1944:24) and of the bony carapace (_op. cit._:32). The\r\nsculpturing on the plastral callosities and carapace seems to be\r\ncorrelated with size; larger specimens (_ferox_) have coarser\r\nsculpturing than do smaller specimens (_muticus_). Stejneger also\r\nmentioned that the sculpturing on many specimens of _ferox_ is\r\nspecialized into prominent, longitudinal welts (_loc. cit._); these\r\nwelts occur also on the carapace of _spinifer_.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the osteological characters examined by me, _T. muticus_\r\nis distinguished from _spinifer_ and _ferox_ by a number of characters\r\n(plastron and especially skull) whereas the species _spinifer_ and\r\n_ferox_ are not easily distinguished from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nComposition of the Genus _Trionyx_ in North America\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the characters previously mentioned and their geographic\r\ndistribution permits the recognition of ten taxa, comprising four\r\nspecies and eight subspecies. Two subspecies, _T. spinifer_ pallidus\r\nand _T. s. guadalupensis_ are described as new. The four species and\r\nthe included subspecies here recognized are:\r\n\r\n  _Trionyx ferox_\r\n  _Trionyx spinifer spinifer_\r\n                    _hartwegi_\r\n                    _asper_\r\n                    _emoryi_\r\n                    _guadalupensis_\r\n                    _pallidus_\r\n  _Trionyx ater_\r\n  _Trionyx muticus muticus_\r\n                   _calvatus_\r\n\r\nThe following key is designed to permit quick identification of living\r\nindividuals; therefore, ratios and osteological characters are avoided\r\nas much as possible in favor of other characters that are the least\r\nvariable and most \"typical.\" Because there is considerable variation\r\ncorrelated with sex and size, each taxon occurs in the key in more\r\nthan one couplet. Large females having mottled and blotched patterns\r\nwill be the most difficult to identify. The characters listed should\r\nbe used in combination because one character alone may not be\r\nsufficient; it is advisable to read both choices of each couplet. The\r\ntext, figures and illustrations should be consulted for final\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL KEY TO NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF THE GENUS\r\nTRIONYX\r\n\r\n     1.

surface of carapace smooth (not \"sandpaper\")\r\non adult males; undersurface whitish, throat often grayish; well-defined\r\nmarginal ridge; anterior edge of carapace laterally to region of insertion\r\nof forelimbs studded with low, flattened tubercles resembling hemispheres, never\r\nconical; carapace usually having blunted tubercles, best developed anteriorly\r\nand posteriorly on midline, but sometimes linearly arranged, resembling ridges,\r\nespecially at margins; anterolateral parts of plastron often extending farther\r\nforward than corresponding parts of carapace.\r\n\r\nRange in length (in cm.) of plastron of ten largest specimens of each sex\r\n(mean follows extremes), males, 17.0-26.0, 20.0;

ventral surface of supraoccipital spine narrow proximally, usually\r\nhaving medial ridge; foramen magnum rhomboidal; opisthotic-exoccipital spur\r\nabsent (82%), sometimes indicated by ridge (16%); distal part of opisthotic wing\r\ntapered, not visible in dorsal view; lateral condyle of articular surface of quadrate\r\nlarger than medial articular surface, not tapered posteriorly; maxillaries in contact\r\nabove premaxillaries; usually a combination of seven neurals, seven pairs\r\nof pleurals, and contact of seventh pair of pleurals (56%), often eight pairs of\r\npleurals (31%); angle of epiplastron forming approximate right angle; often no\r\nsuture between hypoplastra and hyoplastra; callosities on preplastra and epiplastron\r\nusually lacking.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955:19) stated that in specimens from\r\nLake Okeechobee and southward the carapace is wider relative to the width of\r\nthe head, and Neill (1951:19) quoted Allen's observations that _ferox_ from southern\r\nFlorida \"average larger and darker than those collected farther north.\"\r\n\r\nCarr (1952:417) reported that the pale reticulum on the carapace is yellowish\r\nolive, the markings on head are yellow on an olive ground color, some\r\nmarkings more orange, and the plastron slate gray. Duellman and Schwartz\r\n(1958:271) mentioned that the carapace of hatchlings is edged in orange\r\ngrading to yellow posteriorly and has a pattern of bluish-black blotches on a\r\ndull brown background, whereas the carapace is dull brown or blackish on\r\nadults. Neill (_op. cit._:18) wrote \"that the head stripes and the marginal\r\nring of the 'carapace' are orange rather than yellow (yellow at the time of\r\nhatching, however).\"\r\n\r\nThe transition from the dark coloration of hatchlings to the paler coloration\r\nof adults is gradual and subject to individual variation. The loss of\r\ndark color ventrally occurs first on the plastral area, then the hind limbs, forelimbs,\r\nposterior part of carapace and last on the neck and throat. The soft\r\nparts of the body dorsally are gray or dark gray, and do not become so pale\r\nas the ventral surface. The smallest specimen that I have seen displaying the\r\ndark features of the hatchlings is a male, 7.7 centimeters (UMMZ 100673);\r\na female, 9.5 centimeters (UMMZ 110987), is the smallest specimen having\r\na whitish plastral area. The change from dark to pale coloration on the ventral\r\nsurface occurs at a size of 8.0 to 9.0 centimeters. The largest specimens I\r\nhave seen having indistinct, dusky blotches of the underside of the carapace\r\nare a female, 11.3 centimeters (UMMZ 100836), and a male, 16.0 centimeters\r\n(UMMZ 106322). A contrasting pattern on head and limbs, and a\r\ndark throat are still evident in a female 19.2 centimeters (UMMZ 106302).\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_Trionyx ferox_ can be distinguished from all other species\r\nof the genus in North America by the presence of a marginal ridge, longitudinal\r\nridges of tubercles on the carapace of juveniles (less evident in adults),\r\nand the unique juvenal pattern and coloration. The lack of a juvenal pattern\r\nand a smooth surface on the carapace (not gritty like sandpaper) distinguish\r\nadult males from those of _T. spinifer_. Most adults of both sexes can be distinguished\r\nfrom _spinifer_ and _muticus_ by the extension of the plastron farther\r\nforward than the carapace (developed to a slight degree in some specimens\r\nof _T. s. emoryi_). Both sexes of all ages can be distinguished from _muticus_ by\r\nthe presence of knoblike tubercles on the anterior edge of the carapace, and\r\nseptal ridges.\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ is the largest species in North America; the maximum size of the\r\nplastron in adult males is approximately 26.0 centimeters (16.0 in _spinifer_)\r\nand of adult females, 34.0 centimeters (31.0 in _spinifer_). The head is wider\r\nin _ferox_ than in _muticus_ and most subspecies of _spinifer_ (closely approached\r\nby _asper_, _guadalupensis_, _emoryi_ and _T. ater_). The carapace is narrower in\r\n_ferox_ than in _muticus_ and most subspecies of _spinifer_ (closely approached by\r\n_emoryi_ and _T. ater_). The snout is shortest in _ferox_, but almost as short in\r\n_T. s. emoryi_ and _T. ater_. _T. ferox_ has proportionately the longest plastron in\r\nrelation to length of carapace.\r\n\r\nMost skulls of _ferox_ differ from those of _muticus_ and _spinifer_ in having the\r\ngreatest width at the level of the quadratojugal (as do some _T. s. asper_; see\r\naccount of that subspecies). In the skull, _ferox_ resembles _spinifer_ but differs\r\nfrom _muticus_ in having the 1) ventral surface of the supraoccipital spine narrow\r\nproximally, and usually having a medial ridge, 2) foramen magnum rhomboidal,\r\n3) distal part of opisthotic wing tapered, 4) lateral condyle of articular\r\nsurface of quadrate not tapered posteriorly, and larger than medial articular\r\nsurface, and 5) maxillaries in contact above premaxillaries. _T. ferox_ resembles\r\n_muticus_ but differs from most individuals of _spinifer_ in lacking a well-developed\r\nopisthotic-exoccipital spur. _T. ferox_ resembles _spinifer_ but differs from\r\n_muticus_ in having the epiplastron bent at approximately a right angle; _ferox_\r\ndiffers from both _muticus_ and _spinifer_ in lacking a callosity on the epiplastron\r\nand probably in the more frequent fusion of the hyoplastra and hypoplastra.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--The early taxonomic history of _Trionyx ferox_ has been discussed\r\nin detail by Stejneger (1944:27-32), who explained that Dr. Alexander\r\nGarden of Charleston, South Carolina, sent a description and specimen of\r\n_T. ferox_ to Thomas Pennant, and at the same time sent another specimen with\r\ndrawings to a friend, John Ellis, in London. Pennant presented one of the\r\nspecimens and drawings and the description to the Royal Society of London\r\nin 1771; the description was published in 1772 and included Garden's drawings.\r\nBecause two specimens were involved the possibility exists that the\r\ndescription (text, drawings and type specimen) is a composite based on two\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the type. Garden's original description (_in_ Pennant, 1772:268-271)\r\nleaves little doubt that the text subject is a large adult female of _ferox_\r\n(see especially the statements, \"fore part, [of carapace] just where it covers the\r\nhead and neck, is studded full of large knobs, [and] The under, or belly plate,\r\n... is ... extended forward two or three inches more than the back\r\nplate, ...\"). I am indebted to Mr. J. C. Battersby, British Museum (Natural\r\nHistory), Department of Zoology (Reptiles), for information concerning\r\nthe type and for comparing it with the text description and three figures published\r\nby Pennant. The carapace of the type is approximately 16 inches long,\r\n13-1/2 inches wide, and has low, flattened, knoblike tubercles along the anterior\r\nedge. Some inaccuracies on the part of the artist (such as five claws on both\r\nfeet on the right side of Fig. 3, and four claws on the left front foot of Fig. 2 are\r\nevident), and slight changes in the proportions of the type would have occurred\r\nafter death and preservation. It is the opinion of Mr. Battersby that the type,\r\ntext description and three figures represent one specimen. Figures 1 and 2,\r\ndorsal and ventral views respectively, probably represent the same specimen\r\nfrom life; the neck is withdrawn and the tail tip is visible in dorsal view, but\r\nconcealed beneath the posterior edge of the carapace in ventral view. Presumably\r\nthe same specimen (probably drawn from dried and stuffed animal)\r\nis depicted in Figure 3 (dorsal view); the neck is fully extended and a large\r\npart of the thick, pyramidal tail is visible in dorsal view. British Museum (Natural\r\nHistory) 1947.3.6.17 is considered a holotype. The three figures published\r\nby Pennant have been duplicated by Schoepff (1795:Pl. 19) and Duméril and\r\nBibron (1835:482). To my knowledge, the holotype was first specifically designated\r\nas the \"(Type.)\" of _T. ferox_ by Boulenger (1889:259). The skull of the\r\nholotype is figured by Stejneger (1944:Pl. 5).\r\n\r\nGarden did not list a specific locality for the two specimens that he sent to\r\nLondon, but did mention that the turtle was common in the Savannah and\r\nAltamaha rivers (of Georgia), and rivers in east Florida. Boulenger (_loc. cit._)\r\nstated that the locality of the holotype was \"Georgia.\" Baur (1893:220) restricted\r\nthe type locality to the \"Savannah river, Ga.\" Neill (1951:17), who\r\nbelieved _T. ferox_ to be absent from the Savannah River, changed the type\r\nlocality of _ferox_ to east Florida. Schwartz (1956:8) reappraised the status of\r\nsoftshells in Georgia and Florida and reëstablished the Savannah River (at\r\nSavannah), Georgia, as the type locality of _T. ferox_.\r\n\r\nPennant failed to use binomial nomenclature when he published the type\r\ndescription of Garden. The first name-combination (_Testudo ferox_) was proposed\r\nby Schneider (1783:220).\r\n\r\nLacépède (1788:137, Pl. 7) referred to Garden's description in Pennant\r\nonly as \"The Molle\" but on a folded paper chart entitled \"Table Méthodique\r\ndes Quadrupèdes ovipares,\" which is inserted after an introduction of 17 pages,\r\nlisted _T. mollis_; this name is again listed on another folded chart, entitled\r\n\"Synopsis methodica Quadrupedum oviparorum,\" which is inserted between\r\npages 618 and 619 under the genus _Testudo_. The illustration (Pl. 7) was\r\ntaken from Pennant (Duméril and Bibron, _loc. cit._). The type locality has\r\nbeen designated \"(following Stejneger, 1944) as eastern Florida\" by Schmidt\r\n(1953:108).\r\n\r\nBartram failed to use a binomial name with his description of \"the great\r\nsoft shelled tortoise,\" which appeared in his _Travels_ (1791:177-179, Pl. 4 and\r\nunnumbered plate between pages 282 and 283) and two editions of a French\r\ntranslation (1799 and 1801, 1:307); see Harper (1940). Recently, Bartram's\r\n_Travels_ has been placed on the Official Index of Rejected and Invalid Works\r\nin Zoological Nomenclature, Opinion 447 (see Hemming, 1957). Bartram's\r\ndescription of a soft-shelled turtle has provided the basis for the proposal of\r\nat least three name-combinations. The first was _Testudo_ (_ferox?_) _verrucosa_\r\nproposed in 1795 by Schoepff; it appeared simultaneously in _The Historia\r\nTestudinum_ and in a German translation, _Naturgeschichte der Schildkröten_\r\n(see Mittleman, 1944:245). Stejneger (1944:26) listed the type locality as\r\neastern Florida. Daudin (1801:74), also referring to Bartram's description\r\nin his _Voyage_ (French translation), proposed the name _Testudo bartrami_;\r\nHarper (_op. cit._:717) restricted the type locality of _T. bartrami_ from \"Halfway\r\npond,\" east Florida, to southwestern Putnam County between Palatka\r\nand Gainesville, Florida. Rafinesque (1832:64-65), relying on the authenticity\r\nof the illustrations in Bartram's _Travels_ that depict a soft-shelled turtle\r\nhaving five claws on each of the hind feet, tubercles on the sides of the head\r\nand neck, and ten scales in the middle of the carapace (presumably inaccuracies\r\nor a composite on the part of the artist), referred to Bartram's description as\r\na new genus, _Mesodeca bartrami_, a name which Boulenger (1889:245, footnote)\r\nreferred to as \"mythical.\" Geoffroy (1809a:18-19) considered Bartram's\r\ndescription the basis for the recognition of a second species of _Chelys_ (binomial\r\nnomenclature not employed), and Duméril and Bibron (_loc. cit._) suggested\r\nthat the description was based partly on a \"Chelyde Matamata.\"\r\nThe descriptive comments of Bartram are not clearly applicable to _Testudo\r\nferox_ Schneider; _Trionyx ferox_, however, is the only species of soft-shelled\r\nturtle known to occur in the region of Bartram's observations (east Florida),\r\nand the type locality was restricted to Putnam County, Florida, by Harper.\r\nThe name-combinations, _Testudo___ (_ferox?_) _verrucosa_ Schoepff, _Testudo bartrami_\r\nDaudin, and _Mesodeca bartrami_ Rafinesque are junior synonyms of _Testudo\r\nferox_ Schneider.\r\n\r\nSchweigger (1812:285) referred _ferox_ to the genus _Trionyx_ following the\r\ndescription of that genus by Geoffroy in 1809. _Testudo ferox_ was listed as a\r\nsynonym by Geoffroy in the description of _Trionyx georgicus_ (1809a:17);\r\nDuméril and Bibron (1835:432) mentioned that the specific characters of\r\n_georgicus_ were taken from Pennant. The name _Trionyx georgianus_ presumably\r\nappears for this taxon in Geoffroy's earlier-published synopsis (1809:367).\r\n_T. georgicus_ was listed as occurring in rivers of Georgia and the Carolinas;\r\nthe type locality was restricted by Schmidt (_op. cit._:109) to the Savannah\r\nRiver, Georgia. The two specific names _georgicus_ and _georgianus_ are regarded\r\nas substitute names and junior synonyms of _T. ferox_.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy (1809a:14-15) also described _Trionyx carinatus_, a name-combination\r\nthat hitherto has been considered a synonym of _Trionyx ferox_. There\r\nis no indication from the description that _carinatus_ is applicable to _ferox_.\r\nMost comments pertain to a description of the bony carapace and plastron,\r\nwhich Geoffroy depicts in Plate 4. It is a young specimen judging from the\r\nsmall and isolated preneural; the seventh pair of pleurals is unusual in being\r\nfused (no middorsal suture), and the neurals seem large in proportion to\r\nthe size of the pleurals. The anterior border of the carapace is described\r\nas having tubercles. Geoffroy listed _Testudo membranacea_ and _Testudo\r\nrostrata_ as synonyms of _carinatus_. Fitzinger (1835:127) listed _T. membranacea_,\r\n_T. rostrata_ and _T. carinatus_ as synonyms of _Trionyx javanicus_\r\n(= _T. cartilagineus_), which was also described by Geoffroy (_op. cit._:15).\r\nDuméril and Bibron (_op. cit._:478, 482) considered _carinatus_ to be the young\r\nof _spinifer_ (_ferox_ as synonym). Gray (1844:48), however, referred _T. membranacea_\r\nand _T. rostrata_ to the synonymy of _T. javanicus_, but considered _T.\r\ncarinatus_ to be a synonym of _T. ferox_ (_op. cit._:50), an interpretation followed\r\nby all subsequent authors. _Trionyx carinatus_ is questionably listed as a\r\nsynonym of _ferox_ by Stejneger (1944:27). Duméril and Bibron (_op. cit._:482)\r\nwrote that the young type of _carinatus_ is in the museum at Paris. Dr. Jean\r\nGuibé informs me in letter of September 24, 1959, that the type of Geoffroy's\r\n_T. carinatus_ cannot be found in the Natural History Museum at Paris. For\r\nthe present, _T. carinatus_ is considered a _nomen dubium_. According to Stejneger\r\n(1944:27), _Trionyx brongniarti_ Schweigger is a substitute name for\r\n_T. carinatus_.\r\n\r\nI am unable to add anything to Stejneger's (_op. cit._:32) account of _Trionyx\r\nharlani_; the mention of its occurrence in east Florida indicates that it is indistinguishable\r\nfrom _Testudo ferox_ Schneider.\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ was considered to be indistinguishable from Lesueur's _Trionyx\r\nspiniferus_ (described in 1827), until Agassiz (1857:401) pointed out the\r\ndifferences between the two species. However, Agassiz (_op. cit._:402, Pl. 6, Fig.\r\n3) regarded juveniles of _T. spinifer asper_ as the young of _ferox_. Consequently,\r\nthe geographic range of _ferox_, as envisioned by Agassiz, extended from\r\nGeorgia and Florida west to Louisiana. Neill (1951:15) considered all\r\nAmerican forms conspecific. Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955) and Schwartz\r\n(1956) demonstrated that _ferox_ is a distinct species.\r\n\r\nFitzinger (1843:30) designated the species _ferox_ as the type species of\r\nhis genus _Platypeltis_ as follows: \"Platypeltis. Fitz. Am[erica]. _Platypelt.\r\nferox_. Fitz. Typus.\" If populations of soft-shelled turtles that are referable\r\nto _Testudo ferox_ Schneider are considered to comprise a distinct genus by\r\nfuture workers, _Platypeltis_ Fitzinger, 1835, is available as a generic name with\r\n_Testudo ferox_ Schneider, 1783, as the type species (by subsequent designation).\r\n\r\n_Trionyx ferox_ in the northern part of its range is sympatric with _T. spinifer\r\nasper_. In the region of overlap, the two species are nearly always ecologically\r\nisolated; _ferox_ inhabits lentic waters, whereas _T. s. asper_ is partial to lotic\r\nwaters (Crenshaw and Hopkins, _op. cit._:16). There is no evidence of intergradation\r\nor hybridization.\r\n\r\nMany characters of _Trionyx ferox_ that are lacking in other North American\r\nforms are shared with some Asiatic softshells, such as the large size, longitudinal\r\nrows of tubercles that resemble ridges on the carapace, and the marginal\r\nridge. It is thought that, of the living softshells in North America, _ferox_ is\r\nmore closely allied to Old World forms of the genus than to _muticus_ or _spinifer_.\r\n\r\nCarr (1940:107) recorded _ferox_ from Okaloosa County, Florida, in the western\r\nend of the panhandle, whereas Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955:16) list the\r\nknown westward extent of range as Leon and Wakulla counties. AMNH 6933\r\nfrom west of the Apalachicola drainage in Washington County, Florida, tends\r\nto substantiate Carr's record, which is not included on the distribution map.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 144, as follows: FLORIDA: _Alachua_: UMMZ\r\n64178, 100969; USNM 10545, 10704, \"near\" Gainesville; UMMZ 56599, Levy\r\nLake. _Brevard_: AMNH 12878, Canaveral. _Broward_: UMMZ 109441, Hugh\r\nTaylor Birch State Park; USNM 109548, 22 mi.

Most individuals of _T. spinifer_ (except some large females)\r\nresemble _muticus_ but differ from _ferox_ and large females of _ater_\r\nin having a pale outer rim that is separated from the ground color of\r\nthe carapace by a distinct (_spinifer_) or dusky (_muticus_) dark\r\nline. Large females of the subspecies _spinifer_, _hartwegi_, _asper_\r\nand _pallidus_ may have enlarged conical projections along the\r\nanterior edge of the carapace and, unless these projections are\r\nconsiderably worn, are readily distinguished from large females of\r\n_ferox_ (flattened, knoblike prominences), and _muticus_ and _ater_\r\n(smooth surface, no prominences). Large females of the subspecies\r\n_guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ resemble _muticus_ and _ater_, and to\r\nsome extent _ferox_, in having low, scarcely elevated prominences\r\nalong the anterior edge of the carapace. Some females of _emoryi_\r\nresemble _ferox_ in that the plastron extends farther forward than the\r\ncarapace.\r\n\r\n_T. spinifer_ is intermediate in size between _ferox_ (larger) and\r\n_muticus_ (smaller); the maximum size of the plastron in adult males\r\nis approximately 16.0 centimeters (14.0, _muticus_; 26.0, _ferox_),\r\nand of females, 31.0 centimeters (21.5, _muticus_; 32.5, _ferox_). The\r\nhead for all subspecies of _spinifer_ is proportionately narrower than\r\nin _ferox_ but wider than in _muticus_.\r\n\r\nIn the skull, _spinifer_ more closely resembles _ferox_ than\r\n_muticus_, but differs from both _ferox_ and _muticus_ in usually\r\nhaving a well-developed opisthotic-exoccipital spur. Skulls of\r\n_spinifer_ resemble those of _muticus_ but differ from those of\r\n_ferox_ in being widest at the level of the squamosal. Skulls of\r\n_spinifer_ resemble those of _ferox_ but differ from those of\r\n_muticus_ in having the 1) ventral surface of the supraoccipital spine\r\nnarrow proximally, and usually having a medial ridge, 2) foramen\r\nmagnum rhomboidal, 3) distal part of opisthotic wing tapered, 4)\r\nlateral condyle of articular surface of quadrate not tapered\r\nposteriorly, and larger than medial articular surface, and 5)\r\nmaxillaries in contact above premaxillaries. _T. spinifer_ resembles\r\n_ferox_ but differs from _muticus_ in having the epiplastron bent at\r\nan approximate right angle. _T. spinifer_ differs from _ferox_ in\r\nhaving an epiplastral callosity, and from _muticus_ in that the\r\ncallosity does not cover the entire surface of the epiplastron. The\r\nhyo-hypoplastral suture is present more often in _spinifer_ and\r\n_muticus_ than in _ferox_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Gray (1869:221) proposed the generic name _Callinia_ as a\r\nnew name for _Aspidonectes_ as understood by Agassiz (1857:403). Gray\r\nreferred _Trionyx spiciferus_ (= _spiniferus_) Lesueur to _Callinia_.\r\nStejneger (1907:514) designated _Trionyx spiniferus_ Lesueur as the\r\ntype species of _Callinia_. If _Trionyx spiniferus_ Lesueur is\r\nconsidered to be generically distinct from other soft-shelled turtles,\r\n_Callinia_ Gray, 1869, is available as a generic name with _Trionyx\r\nspiniferus_ Lesueur, 1827, as the type species by subsequent\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\n_Geographic variation._--_T. spinifer_ is the most variable and\r\nwidespread species of the genus in North America. Size of ocelli on the\r\ncarapace decreases from east to west on turtles inhabiting waterways of\r\nthe Upper Mississippi River drainage. The most impressive gradient,\r\ngeographically oriented from western Louisiana to southwestern Texas is\r\nseen in each of several features: decrease in size of tubercles on the\r\nanterior edge of the carapace, reduction in contrast of pattern on the\r\ndorsal surface of limbs and side of head, change in pattern on the\r\ndorsal surface of the snout, and increase in the size of white spots on\r\nthe carapace. But the gradient in size of white spots is reversed in _T.\r\ns. emoryi_, which has small white spots on the carapace. Some of the\r\ncharacters at the western terminus of this geographical gradient are\r\nshared with _T. ater_ and _muticus_. Those subspecies comprising the\r\n_emoryi_ group also show proportional characters that correspond closely\r\nwith those of _T. ferox_.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of tuberculation and pattern on carapace, side of head,\r\ndorsal surface of limbs and snout, _Trionyx spinifer_ may be divided\r\ninto six subspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trionyx spinifer spinifer= Lesueur\r\n\r\nEastern Spiny Softshell\r\n\r\nPlates 33, 34, and 52\r\n\r\n     _Trionyx spiniferus_ Lesueur, Mém.

A. Lesueur from the Wabash River,\r\nNew Harmony, Posey County, Indiana (Pl. 52).\r\n\r\n_Range._--Northeastern United States and extreme southeastern Canada\r\nin tributaries flowing into the Mississippi River from the east, and\r\nthe St. Lawrence River drainage; extreme southern Quebec and Ontario,\r\nCanada, east through southern Great Lakes region to Wisconsin, and\r\nsouth through New York, western Pennsylvania and Illinois to Tennessee\r\nand western Virginia (see map, Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of large, thick-bordered black ocelli,\r\noften 9-10 millimeters in diameter in center of carapace on adult\r\nmales, and 2-3 millimeters in diameter on hatchlings (mean OD/PL,\r\nMichigan, .066); only one dark marginal line separating pale rim of\r\ncarapace from dorsal ground color.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 2.7 centimeters\r\n(UMMZ 89950, INHS 3143); of largest male, 14.5 centimeters (UMMZ\r\n72512); of largest female, 31.0 centimeters (UMMZ 40866).\r\n\r\nCarapace olive, having large ocelli in center but smaller ocelli or\r\nspots at sides; ocelli often interrupted; pale rim of carapace not\r\nfour or five times wider posteriorly than laterally, separated from\r\ndarker ground color of carapace by one dark marginal line; large\r\nfemales often having remnants of ocelli at sides of carapace on\r\nmottled and blotched background; pattern on snout of pale,\r\ndark-bordered stripes that unite forming acute angle in front of eyes;\r\nwell-defined dark markings in subocular and postlabial region; pattern\r\ncontrasting with ground color on side of head; postlabial stripe\r\ninterrupted, diffuse; pale postocular stripe having blackish borders\r\ninterrupted, not uniting with postlabial stripe; dorsal surface of\r\nsoft parts of body having contrasting pattern, largest blackish marks\r\non hind limbs; elongate tail of adult males having pale dorsolateral\r\nbands with well-defined lower blackish borders; underparts whitish,\r\noften having blackish marks, except in center of plastral area; dark\r\nmarks on webbing of limbs, palms and soles; dark streaks often\r\ncoincident with digits; small conical tubercles on anterior edge of\r\ncarapace on adult males;

mean CL/PL, 1.39.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Variant individuals include: UMMZ 72512, an adult male,\r\nhaving some ocelli seven millimeters in diameter that are almost solid\r\nspots; UMMZ 89659 having postocular and postlabial stripes connected\r\non right side of head; UMMZ 95615, 52948, 54402 having inner dark\r\nborders of pale stripes on snout represented by short dashes and dots\r\n(a ragged line connecting anterior margins of orbits on 54402); UMMZ\r\n52948, 89659 having interrupted, black marginal lines on carapace with\r\nends of some segments oriented inward and overlapping portion of\r\nadjacent segments; UMMZ 81699, female having plastral length of 19.0\r\ncentimeters, lacking conspicuous tubercles on anterior edge of\r\ncarapace; UI 2403, CNHM 92204 having extensive dark mottling and\r\nmarbling on throat and neck, undersurface of limbs and posterior\r\nportion of carapace.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. s. spinifer_ can be distinguished from all other\r\nsubspecies of _T. spinifer_ by the presence of large black ocelli\r\n(diameter 9-10 mm. on adult males, 2-3 mm. on hatchlings) in\r\ncombination with only one dark marginal line. _T. s. spinifer_\r\nresembles _asper_ in having ocelli or dots on the carapace but differs\r\nfrom _asper_ in having only one dark marginal line and larger ocelli.\r\n_T. s. spinifer_ differs from _hartwegi_ only in the large size of the\r\nocelli. _T. s. spinifer_ resembles _hartwegi_ and _asper_ but differs\r\nfrom _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in having blackish spots\r\nand ocelli on the carapace and lacking whitish dots. _T. s. spinifer_\r\nresembles _hartwegi_, _asper_, and _pallidus_ and differs from\r\n_guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in having conical or knoblike tubercles\r\non the anterior edge of the carapace on large females.\r\n\r\n_T. s. spinifer_ differs from the subspecies _asper_, _guadalupensis_\r\nand _emoryi_ in having a relatively narrower head, and from _emoryi_\r\nin having a relatively wider carapace. _T. s. spinifer_ resembles\r\n_hartwegi_ and _asper_ but differs from the other subspecies in having\r\nthe carapace widest at a plane approximately one-half way back on the\r\ncarapace. The subspecies _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_ have longer snouts\r\nthan _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_, and _emoryi_. _T. s. spinifer_\r\ndiffers from _asper_ but resembles all the other subspecies in having\r\na relatively longer plastron.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Lesueur's description of _Trionyx spiniferus_\r\n(1827:258-261, Pl. 6) seems to be based mostly, if not entirely, on a\r\nlarge female (length of carapace, 13 inches), which was \"Le plus grand\r\ndes individus observes ...\" (_op. cit._:258); an accompanying\r\nillustration depicting the dorsal surface of the bony carapace is\r\nunusual in lacking neurals (Pl. 6, E). Duméril and Bibron (1835:481)\r\nmentioned eight or nine additional specimens that Lesueur sent to the\r\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris. Dr. Jean Guibé informed me under\r\nletter dated September 24, 1959, that a larger stuffed female, bearing\r\ncatalog number 8808 is regarded as the holotype, and that there are\r\nseven additional specimens (1949, 4143, 8807, 8809-12) in the museum\r\nat Paris. All turtles were obtained by Lesueur from the Wabash River.\r\nTo my knowledge no specimen that was available to Lesueur has been\r\nspecifically designated as a type. Because the description seems to be\r\nbased on one specimen, undoubtedly No. 8808, this specimen has been\r\nregarded as the holotype. However, Lesueur referred to several\r\nspecimens and did not mention a type in the original description;\r\nconsequently I prefer to regard No. 8808 as a lectotype.\r\n\r\nLesueur also described _Trionyx ocellatus_ (_op. cit._:261-263) as a\r\nvariety of _T. spiniferus_ having ocelli, or parts thereof, on the\r\ncarapace and mentioned three specimens. The total number of specimens\r\nthat were available to Lesueur is unknown. One young alcoholic\r\nspecimen having ocelli is in the British Museum (Natural History)\r\n(Gray, 1855:69). The same letter from Dr. Guibé stated that a specimen\r\nin the Museum of Natural History, Paris, No. 6957, having a carapace\r\n17 centimeters in length, conforms to the characters of _ocellatus_ as\r\nmentioned by Lesueur, and was obtained from the Wabash River by\r\nLesueur. Two of the specimens mentioned by Lesueur (_loc. cit._) are\r\nstated to be females. No. 6957 is an adult male and clearly shows the\r\njuvenal pattern; it is regarded as the lectotype of _T. ocellatus_\r\nLesueur, a name-combination, which is a synonym, based on a secondary\r\nsexual difference in pattern.\r\n\r\nRafinesque (1832:64) described a soft-shelled turtle from \"the River\r\nHudson between the falls of Hadley, Glen and Baker, and further up to\r\nthe source\" as _Apalone hudsonica_. The most outstanding\r\ncharacteristic was the presence of five claws on the digits of each\r\nlimb. Rafinesque's recording of this characteristic was perhaps\r\ninfluenced by the illustration of a softshell in Bartram's _Travels_\r\nthat showed each limb with five, clawed digits. Perhaps this was the\r\nbasis for Boulenger (1889:245, footnote) regarding _Apalone_ as\r\n\"mythical.\" The large, yellowish, black-bordered spots, one behind and\r\none in front of the eye presumably represent segments of the\r\npostocular stripe and the stripe on the snout; Rafinesque described\r\nthe carapace as \"entire ... the margin is yellowish unspotted, then\r\ncomes a circular black line ...\" and having \"many round spots\r\nocculated and clouded by having a brown margin, with grey dots\r\nwithin.\" Except for five claws, the description is applicable to a\r\nsoftshell and referable to _T. s. spinifer_. To my knowledge, the only\r\nother records of the occurrence of soft-shelled turtles in the Hudson\r\nriver drainage are those of Eights (_in_ Bishop, 1923:120, Mohawk\r\nRiver at Cohoes), and DeKay (1842:7, Mohawk River and Hudson River\r\nnear Albany); presumably these records are the basis for the comments\r\nof Holbrook (_in_ Bishop, _loc. cit._), and symbolized as an isolated\r\nlocality by Conant (1958:318, map 35). The type locality of _Apalone\r\nhudsonica_ is herein restricted to the Hudson River, near Baker's\r\nFalls, Saratoga County, New York.\r\n\r\nGray (1844:48) proposed the name _Tyrse argus_ for a specimen reported\r\nto have come from Sierra Leone, West Africa; later (1855:68), he\r\nreferred the species to the genus _Trionyx_. After comparison with a\r\nspecimen of _T. spiniferus_ Lesueur, Gray (1864:89) was \"doubtful\r\nwhether there must not have been some confusion about the habitat of\r\nthe specimen [which formed the basis of the description of _Tyrse\r\nargus_], and whether it is not more probably a North American\r\nspecies.\" The same author (1869:222; 1870:109) listed _Tyrse argus_ as\r\na synonym of _Callinia spinifera_ (= _Trionyx spiniferus_ Lesueur).\r\n\r\nAgassiz (_op. cit._:406-07) described _Aspidonectes nuchalis_ on the\r\nbasis of three adults from the Cumberland River and a number of young\r\nfrom the headwaters of the Tennessee River. Boulenger (1889:245,\r\nfootnote 2) suggested that the status of _A. nuchalis_ required\r\nfurther investigation. The species was not generally recognized after\r\nthe turn of the century. Barbour and Loveridge (1929:226) listed MCZ\r\n1908 (one of the juveniles) and 1623-25 as cotypes. Stejneger\r\n(1944:52) showed that _nuchalis_ was not distinguishable from _T. s.\r\nspinifer_, and (_op. cit._:49) listed MCZ 1623-25 as cotypes. Schmidt\r\n(1953:110) restricted the type locality to the Cumberland River, near\r\nNashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAgassiz (_loc. cit._) mentioned that _nuchalis_ \"differs strikingly\r\nfrom Asp. spinifer in the much more elongated form of the male, and in\r\nthe great development of the marginal spines and of the tubercles upon\r\nthe carapace, ... But the most prominent specific character consists\r\nin the marked depressions on either side of the blunt median keel, and\r\nalso in the triangular dilation of that keel behind the front margin\r\nof the carapace.\" These characters seem to be of no taxonomic worth. I\r\nhave seen three syntypes (MCZ 1623-25) that undoubtedly correspond to\r\nthe three adult specimens mentioned by Agassiz. All are females,\r\nmeasuring 19.5, 22.0, and 19.0 centimeters, respectively, in plastral\r\nlength, and lack a contrasting mottled pattern on the carapace; the\r\njuvenal pattern is obscured, except for blackish spots at the edge of\r\nthe carapace on MCZ 1625, and parts of an ocellus on MCZ 1624. The\r\ndorsal surfaces of the limbs are boldly marked. MCZ 1623, showing the\r\ndiagnostic feature mentioned by Agassiz, is photographed by Stejneger\r\n(_op. cit._:Pls. 14, 15), and may be regarded as the lectotype of\r\n_Aspidonectes nuchalis_ Agassiz. MCZ 1908 is one of the young syntypes\r\nmentioned by Agassiz, and is referable to _spinifer_. The juvenal\r\npattern consists of spots and ocelli; the plastron measures 3.1\r\ncentimeters in length, and the carapace 4.2 centimeters.\r\n\r\nWied-Neuwied (1865:55-57, Pl. 5) described the species _?G_[_ymnopus_]\r\n_olivaceus_, but was uncertain whether his interpretation was based on\r\na species, a variety or a secondary sexual difference. Wied-Neuwied\r\nmentioned that Lesueur had already named this soft-shelled turtle as\r\n_Trionyx ocellatus_, and agreed with Lesueur that those turtles having\r\nocculated spots on the carapace were distinguishable from _T.\r\nspiniferus_ and _T. muticus_. But because Duméril and Bibron in their\r\n_Erpétologie Général_ failed to recognize _T. ocellatus_, Wied-Neuwied\r\nfelt obliged to bring it to the attention of his American colleagues\r\nand he renamed it. Wied-Neuwied also stated, in the context of a\r\nsynonym, \"Beschreibung einer Reise in Nord-America Bd. I., pag. 140.\"\r\nThis comment presumably refers to his earlier description of _T.\r\nannulifer_ (1838:140); seemingly Wied-Neuwied considered _T.\r\nannulifer_ and _G. olivacea_ as conspecific, although there is no\r\nmention of _annulifer_ in the text proper. Stejneger (_op. cit._:49)\r\ndesignated the type locality of _T. annulifer_ as the Ohio River at\r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and of _Gymnopus olivacea_ as New Harmony,\r\nWabash River, Illinois (_lapsus_ for Indiana).\r\n\r\n_Trionyx spiniferus_ was questionably considered distinct from _T.\r\nferox_ by Lesueur who listed \"Testudo ferox Gm. Tortue de Pennant?\"\r\nand \"Trionyx georgicus Geoffr.?\" as synonyms. Subsequently, most\r\nauthors considered _T. spiniferus_ synonymous with _T. ferox_ until\r\nAgassiz (1857) pointed out differences between the two species.\r\n\r\nThe average size of the ocelli on the carapace of the subspecies\r\n_spinifer_ decreases westward toward the Mississippi River; ocelli of\r\ndifferent sizes occur on different individuals from the same state and\r\npresumably from the same population. For example, INHS 2281, plastron\r\n9.9 centimeters in length, from Effingham County, Illinois, has some\r\nocelli eight millimeters in diameter, whereas a larger male from the\r\nsame locality, UI 1322, plastron 11.6 centimeters in length, has the\r\nlargest ocelli only five millimeters in diameter. For convenience, all\r\nsoftshells having locality data from states east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver are referred to _spinifer_, recognizing that intergradation\r\noccurs with _hartwegi_ over a broad area paralleling the Mississippi\r\nRiver. The type locality of _spinifer_ is in an area where most\r\nturtles do not have the larger ocelli (diameter of seven to ten mm. on\r\nadult males); however, some individuals from the Wabash River (UMMZ\r\n63523, adult male, plastron 11.5 cm. in length, ocelli diameter seven\r\nmm.) agree with more \"typical\" _spinifer_ to the east. Intergradation\r\nwith _asper_ possibly occurs in that part of the Tennessee River in\r\neastern Tennessee as exemplified by UMMZ 59198.\r\n\r\nPublished reports indicate that _T. s. spinifer_ is not abundant in\r\nsome of the northeasterly parts of its geographic range. Adams and\r\nClark (1958:10) wrote that few softshells at Long Point on the\r\nCanadian side of Lake Erie are \"ever collected and the area's game\r\nkeepers report ... (none) ... seen in recent years. They also tell of\r\nrecurrent severe stormy winters in which the muddy bottom of the\r\nmarshland was repeatedly churned up and frozen. Such climatic\r\nconditions could easily destroy a large part of the _Trionyx_\r\npopulation overwintering in the mud bottom.\" Wright (1919:8) reported\r\nthat softshells are \"rarely seen\" in bays on the New York side of Lake\r\nOntario, and Babcock (1938:53) wrote that _spinifer_ \"is not common in\r\nLake Champlain.\"\r\n\r\n_T. s. spinifer_ probably extended its geographic range into the\r\nHudson River drainage of New York _via_ the Erie Canal (connected\r\nBuffalo and Albany) after its completion in the early 1800's (DeKay,\r\n1842:7). Now, the New York Barge Canal (essentially the Erie Canal,\r\nbut with minor changes in course and the addition of several spurs)\r\nprovides an avenue for dispersal of _spinifer_ to the Hudson River\r\ndrainage, Lake Ontario and intervening waterways in New York (Mertens,\r\n1928:199). Netting (1944:86-87), however, suggested that _spinifer_\r\noccupied Lake Champlain, the Finger Lakes, Mohawk River and upper\r\nHudson in the late stages of the formation of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nA publication not seen by me is that of Mansueti and Wallace (1960).\r\nIts title suggests that _Trionyx_ occurs in Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful introduction of _T. s. spinifer_ in the Delaware\r\ndrainage in New Jersey has been discussed by Fowler (1907:213), who\r\nwrote that they were found as early as the late 1860's and were\r\nintroduced when young presumably to stock aquaria. Records of\r\noccurrence include Cooper's Creek, Camden County (Stone, 1906:168);\r\nWoodbury, Gloucester County (Cope, 1894:889); and Paulins Kill at\r\nHainesburg, Warren County (Johnson, 1894:889).\r\n\r\nSurface (1908:122) believed that soft-shelled turtles \"have doubtless\r\nbeen introduced into the eastern part of Pennsylvania through the\r\ncanal from the Western and Central part of New York,\" and Roddy (_in_\r\nNeill, 1951:21) suggested that the species may be found in the\r\nSusquehanna River. Babcock (1919:420) mentioned a young specimen of\r\n_spinifer_ in the collection of the Boston Society of Natural History\r\nthat was obtained \"in White River, Vermont,\" a tributary of the\r\nConnecticut River of the Atlantic Coast drainage; seemingly this\r\nrecord has not been accepted and the species is not established. To my\r\nknowledge, populations of _T. s. spinifer_ do not occur in rivers of\r\nthe Atlantic Coast drainage, except probably the Hudson-Mohawk\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nStockwell (1878:401) wrote that _spinifer_ was found \"as high as\r\nAthabasca.\" Presumably Stockwell referred to Lake Athabaska in\r\nnorthern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, a region where soft-shelled\r\nturtles are unknown; see also the comments by Stejneger (1944:52).\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 250 as follows: ALABAMA: _Morgan_: UMMZ\r\n99578, \"near\" Decatur.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS: _Adams_: INHS 2150, Quincy. _Bond_: INHS 8345, Greenville.\r\n_Carroll_: CNHM 42116, Ordnance School Proving Ground. _Cass_: INHS\r\n2151, Beardstown. _Champaign_: INHS 2273, 2311, 2413, 3142, \"near\"\r\nSeymour; INHS 4229, Champaign; INHS 6163, Sidney. _Christian_: INHS\r\n1560, Pana. _Coles_: INHS 1968-69, 2 mi.

It intergrades with _spinifer_ over a broad area\r\nparalleling the Mississippi River. For convenience, specimens\r\noccurring west of the Mississippi River are referred to the subspecies\r\n_hartwegi_. Figure 8 shows much variation in size of ocelli on\r\ndifferent individuals from the same state. For example, UMMZ 92667,\r\nplastral length 6.7 centimeters has a uniform pale brown carapace\r\nlacking any dark marks, whereas UMMZ 92652, plastral length 5.9\r\ncentimeters has some ocelli three millimeters in diameter on the\r\ncarapace. Both are from Iowa. One specimen from Kansas, KU 1954\r\n(Doniphan County, plastral length 11.8 cm.), has ocelli four\r\nmillimeters in diameter, and USNM 7648 captured farther west at Fort\r\nLaramie, Wyoming, an adult male having a plastral length of 11.0\r\ncentimeters, has some ocelli five millimeters in diameter on the\r\ncarapace. TTC 1090, an adult male from the panhandle of Texas has some\r\nocelli so much as 5.5 millimeters in diameter. The size of the ocelli\r\nseemingly varies in the same local population.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of _T. spinifer_ in the lower Mississippi Valley are\r\nintergrades. Most individuals have small black dots on the carapace;\r\nsome have small ocelli (TU 7216, 7501, 11912, 12123-24) interspersed\r\nwith black dots (TU 5863), others have black dots confined to the edge\r\nof the carapace (TU 157, 4539, 7105), and still others have no pattern\r\non the carapace (TU 7506, 13698.1, 10087.6). Two large males (TU\r\n11580, 13025) have large ocelli (approximately five mm. in diameter)\r\nthat have nearly black centers. In general, there is more dark\r\npigmentation than farther north; some specimens have extensive\r\npigmentation on the ventral surface of the carapace and soft parts of\r\nthe body (TU 156, 5648). The dorsal surface of the limbs, especially\r\nthe hind limbs, have a bold, black marbling and may be almost\r\ncompletely black (TU 5484, 5597). Many females, not exceeding plastral\r\nlengths of 7.0 centimeters, have a pale blotched pattern of lichenlike\r\nfigures or have ill-defined black dots on the carapace (TU 10087,\r\n13698.13, 13753.15).\r\n\r\nLocalities of specimens of _T. spinifer_ occurring in the Mississippi\r\nRiver drainage in Mississippi are arbitrarily listed under the account\r\nof the subspecies _spinifer_, whereas those in Louisiana (excluding\r\n_pallidus_) are listed under the account of _hartwegi_.\r\n\r\nNeither Over (1943) nor Wheeler (1947:169) record _T. s. hartwegi_,\r\nrespectively, from South Dakota or North Dakota; records from the\r\nMissouri River drainage in Montana suggest the occurrence of the\r\nspecies in that drainage in North and South Dakota.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total, 392 as follows: ARKANSAS: _Clay_: UMMZ\r\n70735 (2), 7 mi.

Adult males from the\r\nTombigbee-Alabama river drainage and westward were noted to have\r\nblackish spots (some slightly ocellate) intermixed with few, if any,\r\nsmaller blackish dots, whereas the adult males from east of the\r\nTombigbee-Alabama river drainage had many small, black dots intermixed\r\nwith slightly larger, mostly ocellate marks (see Plate 38, left, top\r\nand bottom, for contrast); also, hatchlings from western populations\r\nwere never observed to have four marginal rings. On the basis of\r\npattern, I would have thought that the individual having many ocelli,\r\nthat lacks correct locality data and that is photographed by Stejneger\r\n(1944:Pl. 26), came from Georgia or South Carolina; but, the pattern\r\n(_op. cit._:Pl. 27) of a specimen, probably an adult male, from South\r\nCarolina, resembles the pattern on adult males from Louisiana. The\r\ndifferences noted above are probably due to individual variation\r\nrather than geographic variation.\r\n\r\nColor notes taken from life of a freshly-killed adult male (TU 16071,\r\nLouisiana) are: carapace olive, spots blackish, outer rim buff; top of\r\nhead olive, postocular and postlabial stripes yellow with blackish\r\nborders, stripes on snout buff with blackish borders; dorsal ground\r\ncolor of soft parts of body pale olive-green, larger marks blackish,\r\nground color laterally toward juncture of pattern and immaculate\r\nundersurface, and toward insertions of neck and limbs becoming\r\nyellowish; webbing on hind limbs having reddish tinge; dorsolateral\r\nbands on tail yellow with blackish borders; undersurface whitish; chin\r\nand throat olive-green with blackish marks; becoming buff then whitish\r\nposteriorly.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 20. Basicranial length and ratio of greatest\r\n       diameter of internal choanae to least width of maxillary\r\n       bridge (IC/MB) on 30 skulls of _T. ferox_ (open circles),\r\n       26 of _T. spinifer_ (crosses), and 12 of the _agassizi_-form\r\n       (solid circles; half shaded circle represents holotype of\r\n       _agassizi_). Skulls of the _agassizi_-form tend to have\r\n       slightly smaller internal choanae than those of _spinifer_\r\n       or _ferox_.]\r\n\r\nOccasional specimens have only one definite dark line paralleling the\r\nrear margin of the carapace. Schwartz (1956:16) reported that\r\nCharleston Museum No. 55.159.26 has only one solid line at the margin\r\nof the carapace, and I received an adult male (KU 47120) reported to\r\nhave come from the Pearl River that is aberrant in not having more\r\nthan one dark marginal line. USNM 95191, a large stuffed female from\r\nthe Pearl River is mentioned by Stejneger (1944:59, Pl. 17) as having\r\nmarks that \"assume the form of short lines parallel with the\r\nsubmarginal ring\"; I examined this specimen and noted that it had only\r\none dark marginal line. Stejneger (_op. cit._:64) mentioned another\r\nfrom the Pearl River drainage, and Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955:20)\r\nwrote that some individuals from Georgia have only one dark marginal\r\nline. Presumably MCZ 1606 (now in the Albany Museum) recorded by\r\nStejneger (_op. cit._:52) as _Amyda s. spinifer_ from Columbus,\r\nGeorgia, is another specimen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21. Basicranial length and greatest width of\r\n       alveolar surface of maxilla on 52 skulls of _T. spinifer_ (open\r\n       circles) and 11 of the _agassizi_-form (solid circles; half shaded\r\n       circle represents holotype of _agassizi_). Most skulls of the\r\n       _agassizi_-form that exceed 43 mm. in basicranial length have a\r\n       more expanded, alveolar surface of the maxilla than skulls of\r\n       _spinifer_ of approximately the same size. All skulls exceeding\r\n       50 mm. are those of females.]\r\n\r\nSome skulls of soft-shelled turtles from streams of the Atlantic Coast\r\ndrainage, including the skull of the holotype of _Platypeltis_ (=\r\n_Trionyx_) _agassizi_ Baur (MCZ 37172, Pl. 54), show at least two\r\ndifferences from other skulls of _asper_ and from those of other\r\nsubspecies of _T. spinifer_. Figure 20 shows that skulls of _agassizi_\r\ntend to have slightly smaller internal choanae (ratio IC/MB) than\r\nthose of _T. spinifer_ and _T. ferox_; there is seemingly little\r\ndifference between skulls of _ferox_ and _spinifer_, and little, if\r\nany, ontogenetic variation. Figure 21 shows that most skulls of the\r\n_agassizi_-form that exceed 43.0 millimeters have a more expanded,\r\nalveolar surface of the maxilla than skulls of _spinifer_ of\r\napproximately the same size; most skulls exceeding a basicranial\r\nlength of 43.0 millimeters, and certainly all skulls exceeding 50.0\r\nmillimeters are those of females. Stejneger (1944:Pl. 30) also has\r\nprovided photographs of a skull of the _agassizi_-form. It is of\r\ninterest that of the 12 _agassizi_-form skulls (MCZ 37172; USNM 8708,\r\n029034, 51981, 66859, 71681, 91282, 91310-11, 92521, 92583-84) that I\r\nexamined some resemble _ferox_ (Neill, 1951:9) in having the alveolar\r\nsurfaces of the jaws broadened, and the greatest width at the level of\r\nthe quadratojugal (Table 3, Plate 54); also, the localities of all 12\r\nskulls are within the geographic range of _ferox_. Skulls of _ferox_,\r\nhowever, have conspicuously broadened alveolar surfaces of the jaws\r\nonly when they exceed in length the largest skulls of _agassizi_. The\r\ndifferences of skulls of the _agassizi_-form possibly reflect\r\nisolation in the Atlantic Coast drainage, and an adaptation in feeding\r\nhabits. So far as I can ascertain, individuals occurring in rivers of\r\nthe Atlantic Coast drainage in Georgia and South Carolina (referable\r\nto _agassizi_) do not differ consistently in external characters from\r\nindividuals of _T. s. asper_ that occur westward in the Apalachicola\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_Trionyx s. asper_ can be distinguished from all other\r\nsubspecies of _T. spinifer_ by usually having more than one black line\r\nparalleling the rear margin of the carapace. This character and the\r\nfrequent fusion of the postlabial and postocular stripes on the side of\r\nthe head distinguish _asper_ from _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_. _T. s.\r\nasper_ differs from _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in having\r\nblackish spots and ocelli on the carapace, and lacking whitish dots or\r\ntubercles. _T. s. asper_ resembles _spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _pallidus_\r\nbut differs from _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in having conical\r\ntubercles along the anterior edge of the carapace in large females. For\r\nadditional differences see accounts of other subspecies.\r\n\r\nOf the subspecies of _T. spinifer_, _asper_ has a proportionately wide\r\nhead that is closely approached in the subspecies _guadalupensis_ and\r\n_emoryi_; _T. s. asper_ differs from _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in\r\nhaving a wider carapace, and resembles _hartwegi_ and _spinifer_, but\r\ndiffers from the other subspecies in having the carapace widest at a\r\nplane approximately one-half way back on the carapace. _T. s. asper_\r\ndiffers from the other subspecies in having the shortest plastron.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Stejneger (1944:72-74) has discussed the history of Baur's\r\n_Platypeltis agassizi_. Briefly, Agassiz's description of _Platypeltis\r\nferox_ wherein he (1857:402) states that \"The young ferox [Pl. 6, fig.\r\n3] has two or three concentric black lines separating the pale margin\r\n...,\" was applicable to _T. s. asper_. Agassiz mentioned also that the\r\nyoung of his _Aspidonectes asper_ (_op. cit._:406) \"as in Platypeltis\r\nferox, ... has ... two or three black lines separating the pale rim of\r\nthe posterior margin, ...\"; however, _A. asper_ was distinguished\r\nchiefly by the \"... prominent warts of the bony plates (_loc. cit._).\"\r\nBecause the description of the pattern of _ferox_ resembled that of\r\n_asper_, the validity of _asper_ was not agreed upon by all workers.\r\nBoulenger (1889:245, footnote 1) referred to _asper_ as a species that\r\nrequired \"... further investigation.\"\r\n\r\nBaur (1888:1121) realized that Agassiz's description of _ferox_ was not\r\nthat of _Testudo ferox_ Schneider, and regarded the description of\r\nAgassiz as applying to a new species, which he named _Platypeltis\r\nagassizii_; Baur (_op. cit._:1122) also recognized _asper_, referring it\r\nto the genus _Aspidonectes_. Baur designated a specimen from Georgia\r\n(the only individual seen by him) as the type of _agassizi_ (Stejneger,\r\n_op. cit._:73, footnote); this specimen is now MCZ 37172. Five years\r\nlater (1893:218), Baur discussed generic relationships of trionychids,\r\nseemingly only on the basis of skulls (holotype of _agassizi_ not\r\nmentioned), and referred _agassizi_ to the resurrected genus\r\n_Pelodiscus_ Fitzinger, 1835, which was distinguished from the other two\r\nAmerican genera that Baur recognized (_Platypeltis_ and _Amyda_) by\r\nhaving the \"Posterior nares reduced in size by the inner and posterior\r\nextension of the maxillaries.\" Baur also transferred _asper_ to the\r\ngenus _Platypeltis_, and restricted the type locality of that species to\r\n\"Lake Concordia, La.\" (_op. cit._:220); the type locality of _agassizi_\r\nwas restricted to \"Western Georgia\" (_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\nThe name-combination, _Pelodiscus agassizi_, was not generally accepted.\r\nHay (1892:144) and Siebenrock (1924:188) referred _agassizi_ to the\r\ngenus _Trionyx_. Hay regarded _agassizi_ as a full species (see\r\ndiscussion by Stejneger, 1944:73), whereas Siebenrock considered it a\r\nsubspecies of _spiniferus_; both authors regarded _asper_ as a synonym\r\nof _agassizi_. Neither _asper_ nor _agassizi_ was mentioned in the first\r\nthree editions of the Check List of North American Amphibians and\r\nReptiles (Stejneger and Barbour, 1917, 1923, 1933); the same authors in\r\nthe fourth (1939:171, 172) and fifth editions (1943:212, 213) listed\r\n_agassizi_ as a full species, and _asper_ as a subspecies of\r\n_spinifera_. Stejneger (1944) used the same arrangement as set forth in\r\nthe fourth and fifth editions of the Check List, and distinguished\r\n_agassizi_ on the basis of cranial characters, namely, the small size of\r\nthe internal choanae, the greater width of the alveolar surface of the\r\nlower jaw, and the position of the suture between the palatine and\r\nbasisphenoid relative to the posterior edge of the temporal fossa. Neill\r\n(1951:9) regarded the peculiarities of the _agassizi_-type skull as\r\ninconstant, but recognized _agassizi_ (and _asper_) as a subspecies of\r\n_ferox_. Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955) showed that _asper_ did not\r\nintergrade with _ferox_. Schwartz showed that _agassizi_ did not\r\nintergrade with _ferox_, and regarded _agassizi_ as a synonym of _T. s.\r\nasper_ (1956:17), but stated that _agassizi_ possessed \"wider crushing\r\nsurfaces on the maxillae than does _T. s. asper_, even when skulls of\r\nthe same size and sex are compared\" (_op. cit._:9).\r\n\r\nThe holotype of _Platypeltis agassizi_ (MCZ 37172) is a dried adult\r\nfemale consisting of shell, skull and limb bones; the carapace is\r\napproximately 300 millimeters long (Schwartz, _loc. cit._). I have\r\nexamined only the skull of MCZ 37172 (Plate 54), and it is the largest\r\nof 12 _agassizi_-type skulls I have seen. The basicranial length is 72.5\r\nmillimeters, and the greatest width, which occurs at the level of the\r\nquadratojugals, is 52.9 millimeters. The _agassizi_-type skulls have\r\nbeen discussed under the subsection on variation.\r\n\r\nThe type locality of _T. s. asper_, Lake Concordia, Louisiana (lower\r\nMississippi River drainage) as restricted by Baur (1893:220), is in an\r\narea of intergradation of three subspecies of _Trionyx spinifer_ where\r\nmost individuals are not typical of _asper_. The syntypes, the\r\ndesignation of MCZ 1597 as a lectotype, and Pearl River, Columbus,\r\nMarion County, Mississippi, as the type locality have been discussed\r\nelsewhere (Webb, 1960).\r\n\r\nThe range of _T. s. asper_ overlaps that of _T. ferox_ in Georgia and\r\nSouth Carolina. The two species remain distinct in the area of overlap\r\nof their geographic ranges (Crenshaw and Hopkins, 1955:16; Schwartz,\r\n_op. cit._:5). _Trionyx s. asper_ intergrades with _T. s. hartwegi_ and\r\n_T. s. spinifer_ in the lower Mississippi Valley (Conant and Goin,\r\n1948:11).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are few specimens available that indicate intergradation\r\nof _asper_ with the _spinifer-hartwegi_ complex in the lower Mississippi\r\nRiver drainage; this may be due to the fact that _asper_ inhabits\r\nwaterways that do not drain into the Mississippi River. Perhaps\r\nintergradation is more prevalent than the morphological basis that I\r\nhave relied upon indicates; in any event, there are few specimens that\r\nhave more than one dark marginal line (which is the only character that\r\nis unique for _asper_) from the lower Mississippi drainage. A young male\r\n(TU 11928.9) from Bayou Gauche between Paradis and Des Allemands, St.\r\nCharles Parish, Louisiana, has a pattern on the carapace resembling that\r\nof _asper_; several other small softshells (TU) are available from the\r\nsame locality but none shows more than one dark marginal line. Another\r\nspecimen (USNM 95192), a young female from a barrow pit of the Big Black\r\nRiver (Mississippi River drainage), Madison County, Mississippi,\r\nresembles _asper_ in having more than one marginal ring. Of three large\r\nfemales from Moon Lake, an ox-bow of the Mississippi River in Coatopa\r\nCounty, Mississippi (AMNH 5285-86, 5289), only 5289 shows evidence of\r\ntwo marginal lines. USNM 73669 (Greenwood, LeFlore County, Mississippi)\r\nalso indicates intergradation in that the spots tend to be linear just\r\ninside the dark marginal line, but the specimen more closely resembles\r\nthe _hartwegi-spinifer_ complex rather than _asper_.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little adumbration of the dark marginal lines of\r\n_asper_ in populations from the lower Mississippi River drainage.\r\nBlackish spots and ocelli vary in size and there are many kinds of\r\npattern on the carapace. Soft-shelled turtles inhabiting the Mississippi\r\nRiver and its tributaries in Louisiana and Mississippi certainly\r\nrepresent an intergrading population of _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_, and,\r\nto a lesser extent, of _asper_. Soft-shelled turtles inhabiting the\r\nPearl River drainage and rivers that drain into Lake Pontchartrain\r\nimmediately adjacent to the east are predominantly _asper_.\r\n\r\nSpecimens having localities from the Pearl River and Lake Pontchartrain\r\ndrainages are listed under the account of _asper_ and are referred to\r\nthat subspecies on the distribution map; specimens from the Mississippi\r\ndrainage in Mississippi are referred to _spinifer_.\r\n\r\nOne specimen (UMMZ 59198, Bradley County, Tennessee), from the Tennessee\r\nRiver drainage where _T. s. spinifer_ occurs, deviates markedly from\r\n_spinifer_ and suggests intergradation. UMMZ 59198, plastral length 4.8\r\ncentimeters, has ocelli in the center of the carapace only two\r\nmillimeters in diameter, a distinct but interrupted, second marginal\r\nring consisting of spots, and the pale postlabial and postocular stripes\r\nin contact on both sides of the head.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 110, as follows: ALABAMA: _Barbour_: UMMZ\r\n113038, Chattahoochee River, Eufala. _Cherokee_: ANSP 24592, \"near\"\r\ncenter of Terrapin Creek. _Conecuh_: UMMZ 70736, Murder Creek,\r\nCastleberry. _Escambia_: TU 15823, Escambia River, 1 mi.

H. Emory.\r\n\r\n_Range._--Southwestern United States and northern México; the Río\r\nGrande drainage in Texas, New Mexico and northern México; the Río San\r\nFernando and Río Purificación drainages in northeastern México; the\r\nColorado River drainage in Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Nevada\r\n(see map, Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of white dots, not encircled with dusky\r\nor blackish ocelli, confined to posterior third of carapace; pale rim\r\nof carapace conspicuously widened, four to five times wider\r\nposteriorly than laterally; a dark triangle in front of eyes, base\r\nline connecting anterior margins of orbits; pale postocular stripe\r\ninterrupted leaving conspicuous pale, usually dark-bordered, blotch\r\njust behind eye.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 2.5 centimeters\r\n(USNM 7632); of largest male, 13.0 centimeters (KU 2914, 3125, 3150);\r\nof largest female, 22.0 centimeters (TNHC 8023, 8104).\r\n\r\nCarapace pale brownish or tan, lacking whitish dots on anterior half;\r\nwhitish dots confined to posterior third of carapace, sometimes\r\nlacking posteriorly, especially on juveniles; small, blackish dots\r\nrarely occurring on surface of carapace, usually confined to margins\r\nwhen present; pale rim of carapace four to five times wider\r\nposteriorly than laterally.\r\n\r\nPattern on snout rarely variable, consisting of pale stripes extending\r\nforward from eyes that have only their outer borders darkened and a\r\nstraight or slightly curved, dark line that connects anterior margins\r\nof orbits; few, if any, dark markings in subocular and postlabial\r\nregion; pattern on side of head having few contrasting marks, often of\r\nnearly uniform coloration; postocular stripe usually interrupted;\r\nanterior segment of postocular stripe just behind eye usually\r\ndark-bordered; posterior segment usually not dark-bordered or sharply\r\ndistinguished from background; pattern on dorsal parts of soft parts\r\nof body contrasting, of relatively small dark marks; dark streaks\r\noften coincident with digits.\r\n\r\nUnderparts whitish, occasionally having blackish dots or smudges on\r\nposterior part of carapace, in region of bridge, or on lateral parts\r\nof chin and throat; few dark marks often on webbing of limbs and on\r\npalms and soles.\r\n\r\nSmall, flattened or wartlike, tubercles that occasionally have sharp\r\ntips along anterior edge of carapace on adult males; tubercles\r\nflattened, scarcely elevated, never conical along anterior edge of\r\ncarapace on large females; whitish, knoblike tubercles often present\r\nposteriorly in middle of carapace and in nuchal region on large\r\nfemales; mottled and blotched pattern sometimes contrasting on\r\ncarapace of large females; whitish dots of juvenal pattern often\r\nvisible through overlying blotched pattern of large females.\r\n\r\nOntogenetic variation in PL/HW, mean PL/HW of specimens having\r\nplastral lengths 7.0 centimeters or less, 3.68, and exceeding 7.0\r\ncentimeters, 5.19; ontogenetic variation in CL/CW, mean CL/CW of\r\nspecimens having plastral lengths 8.5 centimeters or less, 1.17, and\r\nexceeding 8.5 centimeters, 1.27; mean CL/PCW, 2.18; mean HW/SL, 1.43;\r\nmean CL/PL, 1.37.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Ten topotypes (six males, three females, one juvenile)\r\nfrom Brownsville, Texas (BCB 7465-73, 7564), have the following\r\ncharacteristics: pale rim widened posteriorly as described above;\r\nfemales (plastral lengths 9.8, 10.2 and 11.7 cm.) having blackish\r\nmarks in pale rim, which are absent in males of corresponding size;\r\ninterrupted postocular stripe with pale blotch behind eye; postocular\r\npale blotch having blackish borders or not; dark triangular mark on\r\nsnout in front of eyes; white dots present only on posterior third of\r\ncarapace; carapace of females grayish, blotched pattern not\r\ncontrasting; carapace of males paler, greenish-gray; undersurface\r\nimmaculate except 7468 and 7472 that have blackish flecks at bridge\r\nand, on 7472, blackish marks that extend posteriorly onto ventral\r\nsurface of carapace; tubercles along anterior edge of carapace\r\nflattened and rounded in adult males, more knoblike in females;\r\nlargest specimen, BCB 7472, female, plastron 11.7 centimeters long.\r\n\r\n_T. s. emoryi_ varies more than any other subspecies of _Trionyx\r\nspinifer_. A large series of males and females (KU) from the Salt\r\nRiver (Colorado River drainage), near Phoenix, Arizona, is\r\ncharacterized by many adult males having indistinct white dots on\r\nposterior half of carapace; blotching on carapace of females of\r\ncontrasting lichenlike figures, but usually non-contrasting and pale\r\nbrownish or tan; pale rim of carapace distinct from ground color of\r\ncarapace in largest female (KU 2905, plastron 21.5 cm. in length), but\r\nhaving dark or dusky markings: dark interorbital stripe often lacking.\r\nAMNH 58370 (Nevada) and UMMZ 92006 (Arizona) also have the dark line\r\nconnecting the anterior margins of the orbits interrupted; seemingly\r\nthe dark interorbital line is most often interrupted in those\r\nsoftshells inhabiting the Colorado River system of Nevada and Arizona.\r\n\r\nOther variant individuals are: TU 14453.2, 14462 and 3696 having the\r\nplastron extending slightly farther forward than the carapace, thus\r\nresembling _T. ferox_; UMMZ 54021 and CNHM 39999, hatchlings, lacking\r\ndistinct whitish dots on posterior half of carapace; UI 43509 and KU\r\n39991 having stained (brown or blackish) claws; and, CNHM 6810, an\r\nadult male, lacking a spinose (sandpapery) carapace. I am unable to\r\ndiscern geographic variation in these or other characters.\r\n\r\nThe ground color of the carapace on some individuals from the Pecos\r\nRiver (TU, Terrell County, Texas) is grayish and in contrast with the\r\npale rim (Pl. 44). UI 43509 from the Río Florida, La Cruz, Chihuahua,\r\na female, has a dark brownish carapace with little evidence of a\r\nblotched pattern except on the pale rim of the carapace. A female and\r\nadult male from the Río Sabinas, Coahuila (MSU 905-06), also show\r\nconsiderable darkening on the dorsal surfaces; the pale rim is evident\r\nbut not in sharp contrast to the coloration of the carapace. Notes\r\ntaken on the freshly-killed Sabinas individuals are: male--carapace\r\nolive-gray; dorsal surface of soft parts of body olive-green to\r\ngrayish, a bright yellow suffusion on limbs and neck; female--carapace\r\nand soft parts of body dark olive, laterally pale yellow; the plastron\r\nextends slightly farther forward than the carapace in both sexes.\r\n\r\nNotes on coloration (judged to be the most common or \"normal\" type)\r\nof living _emoryi_ from the Río Mesquites, central Coahuila, are:\r\nAdult male (KU 53753)--pale rim butterscotch yellow; marginal line\r\nblackish; whitish dots on pale brown or tan carapace; soft parts of\r\nbody olive or olive-green, slightly darker on head and paler\r\n(yellowish) on hind limbs; pale areas on side of head pale yellow,\r\nhaving tint of orange on neck; ventral surface white, yellow laterally\r\non neck. Adult female (KU 53754)--carapace having contrasting blotched\r\nand mottled pattern of pale browns and tans; soft parts of body olive\r\nbrown, darker brown blotching on head; dorsal surface of limbs\r\nolive-green having pale areas lemon yellow and webbing butterscotch\r\nyellow; side of neck and head, chin and throat pale lemon yellow;\r\nventral surface white having slight red tinge to groin and soft parts\r\nposteriorly; underside of carapace near edge pale yellow.\r\n\r\nSoftshells from the Río Grande in the Big Bend region of Texas, and\r\nthe Río Conchos in Chihuahua differ from other specimens of _emoryi_.\r\nFifteen adult males, KU 51187-201 (no females in sample), were taken\r\nfrom the mouth of the Río San Pedro at Meoquí, Chihuahua (see KU\r\n51194, Pl. 44). They are noteworthy because of a conspicuous orange or\r\norange-yellow on the side of the head. Another relatively consistent\r\ncharacter is the blackish tip of snout (excepting 51199), although the\r\ndegree (palest on 51190) and extent of pigmentation posteriorly on the\r\nsnout is variable. Eleven males, KU 51175-85, from approximately 100\r\nmiles northeastward in the Río Conchos near Ojinaga, Chihuahua, also\r\nhave the bright orange on the side of the head; the tip of the snout\r\nis not blackish, although in some it is slightly darkened. Three\r\nfemales, KU 51174, 51186 (from Ojinaga) and 51173 (from 8 mi. S, 16\r\nmi. W Ojinaga), lack the orange on the side of the head; KU 51186 has\r\na plastral length of 8.0 centimeters, whereas the other two females\r\nhave the same plastral length of 16.5 centimeters (larger than any\r\nmale). Nineteen adult males, KU 51965-72, 51980-90, from the Río\r\nGrande near Lajitas also have the orangish coloration on the side of\r\nthe head, whereas twenty females, KU 51954-64, 51973-79, 51991-92\r\n(three smaller than largest male) lack the coloration. The tip of the\r\nsnout is not blackish on any turtle in the series from Lajitas. The\r\nsmallest female, from Lajitas, having a plastral length of 6.9\r\ncentimeters, has a mottled carapace.\r\n\r\nThe orange of males is most conspicuous in the pale postocular and\r\npostlabial areas; the stripes of the snout (distally) and the color of\r\nthe neck at its juncture with the immaculate ventral surface are\r\norange-yellow. The orange coloration is confined to males (all\r\nexamined were sexually mature) and is probably not of seasonal\r\noccurrence (see comments under secondary sexual variation). I have not\r\nnoticed this coloration in other males of the subspecies _emoryi_;\r\nhowever, long-preserved males might be expected to lack the orange\r\ncolor; the specimens mentioned above were initially preserved in\r\nalcohol. KU 51179 (plastral length 8.2 cm., from Ojinaga) is the\r\nsmallest sexually mature male of the species _spinifer_ that I have\r\nseen. Another character of note is the generally greater development\r\nof the plastral callosities (resembling _muticus_) than in other\r\nsubspecies of _spinifer_ or specimens of _emoryi_; three small adult\r\nmales (KU 51177, 51990, 51987, plastral length 9.3, 9.9 and 9.1 cm.,\r\nrespectively) have large hyoplastral and hypoplastral callosities that\r\nappear to touch medially, and callosities on the epiplastron and both\r\npreplastra.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1953, an adult male of _T. spinifer_ was removed from a\r\nhoop-net set in the Río Purificación at Padilla, Tamaulipas, México. I\r\nwas particularly impressed by the lack of whitish dots on the dark\r\ncarapace; the following notes were taken from the freshly-killed\r\nspecimen: carapace a uniform dark olive, lacking white dots and having\r\na yellowish rim widest posteriorly; tubercles on anterior edge of\r\ncarapace only slightly raised, inconspicuous; top of head olive with\r\nfew dots and streaks; a well-defined yellowish postocular stripe not\r\nconspicuously interrupted; sharp contrast between dark olive on side\r\nof head and pale ventral coloration; yellowish-orange ventrolaterally\r\non head; an uninterrupted slightly-curved line connecting the anterior\r\nmargins of the orbits; carapace pear-shaped; underparts whitish,\r\nlacking markings. This specimen has since been destroyed. The only\r\nother specimen I have seen from this locality is a hatchling (UMMZ\r\n69412, Pl. 43), which has a pale brownish or tan carapace that lacks\r\nwhitish dots; it resembles _emoryi_ in other characters. Although the\r\nabsence of whitish dots is not distinctive, its combination with the\r\nuniform dark olive carapace in adult males and the fact that the Río\r\nPurificación is an isolated drainage system, suggests that\r\nsoft-shelled turtles from that river system may warrant further\r\ntaxonomic study.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--From all other subspecies of _spinifer_, _T. s.\r\nemoryi_ can be distinguished by having a pale rim on the carapace that\r\nis four to five times wider posteriorly than it is laterally. This\r\ncharacter, unique for _emoryi_, combined with patterns on the snout,\r\nside of head and carapace that are subject to little variation, permit\r\nready identification of the subspecies _emoryi_. _T. s. emoryi_\r\nresembles _pallidus_, and _guadalupensis_ and differs from _spinifer_,\r\n_hartwegi_ and _asper_ in having whitish tubercles or dots on the\r\ncarapace. _T. s. emoryi_ resembles _guadalupensis_ but differs from\r\n_pallidus_, _spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_ in lacking conical\r\ntubercles along the anterior edge of the carapace on large females.\r\nFor additional differences see accounts of other subspecies.\r\n\r\nSome populations of _T. s. emoryi_ resemble _T. muticus_ in the size\r\nat which sexual maturity is attained and in the development of the\r\nplastral callosities. _T. s. emoryi_ has a wide head that resembles\r\nthat of _T. ferox_, _T. ater_, _T. s. asper_ and _T. s.\r\nguadalupensis_; _T. s. emoryi_ also resembles _T. ferox_ and _T. ater_\r\nbut differs from the other subspecies of _T. spinifer_ and _T.\r\nmuticus_ in having a narrower carapace. _T. s. emoryi_ resembles _T.\r\ns. guadalupensis_, _T. s. pallidus_ and _T. ater_, and differs from\r\nthe other subspecies of _spinifer_ and _T. muticus_, in having the\r\ncarapace widest farther posteriorly than one-half way back on the\r\ncarapace. _T. s. emoryi_ resembles _T. ferox_ in having the shortest\r\nlength of snout of the subspecies of _spinifer_. The plastron is\r\nshorter than in _T. ferox_, longer than in _T. s. asper_, and about\r\nthe same length as in _T. muticus_ and the other subspecies of _T.\r\nspinifer_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Agassiz (1857, 1:407-08) did not designate a holotype in\r\nthe original description of _Aspidonectes emoryi_; specimens are\r\nmentioned from the lower Río Grande of Texas, near Brownsville, and a\r\nstream of the Río Brazos drainage in Williamson County, Texas. The\r\ndescription is applicable to _T. s. emoryi_ as herein restricted,\r\nexcept for the statement that the white tubercles of young specimens\r\nare \"encircled by faint black lines\"; that statement is presumably\r\nbased on the juveniles from Williamson County. _T. s. emoryi_ does not\r\noccur in Williamson County, Texas. Barbour and Loveridge (1929:225)\r\nlisted MCZ 1909-10 and 1627 as cotypes. Stejneger (1944:65) mentioned\r\nMCZ 1909, 1913 and USNM 7855 as cotypes; the legend for Plate 20 (_op.\r\ncit._) refers to a drawing that \"corresponds fairly closely with the\r\ntype (MCZ 1910) collected at Brownsville, Texas, by Col. Emory.\"\r\n\r\nThe syntypic series consists of seven specimens--MCZ 1627 (two\r\nspecimens) from Williamson County, Texas; MCZ 1909 (three specimens)\r\nand 1910 from Brownsville, Texas; and USNM 7855 from Brownsville,\r\nTexas. The listing of number 1913 by Stejneger is considered a\r\n_lapsus_ for 1910 as MCZ 1913 is catalogued as a _Graptemys\r\ngeographica_ (in letter dated November 17, 1959 from Dr. Ernest E.\r\nWilliams). Stejneger's reference to MCZ 1910 as the type is considered\r\nunintentional and an inadequate designation of a lectotype.\r\n\r\nIn the \"remarks\" column of the USNM museum catalog, number 7855 is\r\nreferred to as \"Ag. Type.\" USNM 7855 is here designated as lectotype\r\nof _Trionyx spinifer emoryi_. The lectotype is a young specimen\r\n(female?) that is not easily sexed by external characters; the\r\nplastron measures (in centimeters) 6.3 in length, the carapace 8.2 in\r\nlength and 7.0 in width, and the head 1.4 in width. The carapace is\r\npale brown having inconspicuous whitish dots posteriorly and a pale\r\nrim that is approximately 6.8 times wider posteriorly (4.1 mm.) than\r\nit is laterally (0.6 mm.). The slightly curved dark line connecting\r\nthe anterior margins of the orbits is dimmer than the dark lines that\r\nextend forward from the eyes. The pale postocular stripes having\r\nblackish, dotted borders are interrupted; there are no other markings\r\non the side of the head. The ventral surface is immaculate except for\r\na few dark dots on the right side of the carapace; the ground color is\r\npale brown or tan, but the upper layer of skin can be scraped away\r\nrevealing an underlying pale lavender-cream ground color. The\r\ntubercles along the anterior edge of the carapace resemble small\r\nrounded warts.\r\n\r\nMCZ 1910 is an adult male _T. s. emoryi_ having a plastron 10.7\r\ncentimeters in length. The carapace is pale brown having a relatively\r\nsmooth anterior edge, inconspicuous whitish tubercles posteriorly, and\r\na pale rim five times wider posteriorly than laterally; the pattern on\r\nthe head resembles that of _emoryi_.\r\n\r\nEach of three hatchlings of _T. s. emoryi_, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.9\r\ncentimeters in plastral length, bears an MCZ catalogue number of 1909.\r\nThe carapaces are dark tan or gray having pale rims 3.7, 5.2 and 5.2\r\ntimes wider posteriorly than laterally, and white dots absent or\r\nobscure posteriorly; two specimens have small blackish dots\r\nparalleling the pale rim posteriorly. The patterns on the heads are\r\nreferable to _emoryi_.\r\n\r\nThe two juvenal syntypes (5.2 and 6.1 cm. in plastral length) from\r\nWilliamson County, Texas, are both catalogued as MCZ 1627, but only\r\none of these bears a catalogue number. The two softshells are not\r\n_emoryi_, and are more nearly like _T. s. guadalupensis_ than _T. s.\r\npallidus_. Actually, they are from an area of intergradation between\r\nthose subspecies (see comments concerning intergradation under the\r\naccounts of the subspecies _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_). White\r\nspots occur on the carapaces anteriorly and posteriorly, the larger\r\n(more posterior) of which are encircled with dusky ocelli. The\r\ncarapace of the small specimen (bearing no number) is brown having a\r\nfew, small black specks intermixed with the white spots. The carapace\r\nof the large specimen is pale lavender and has a more obscure pattern\r\nthan the other specimen.\r\n\r\nAfter Agassiz's description, _emoryi_ was accepted as a distinct\r\nspecies. Neill (1951:15) suggested that _emoryi_ was subspecifically\r\nrelated to _T. ferox_. Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955) and Schwartz\r\n(1956), however, demonstrated that _ferox_ was a distinct species;\r\n_emoryi_ has since been considered a subspecies of _T. spinifer_.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens having blackish dots on the carapace, indicate\r\nrelationship with _T. s. guadalupensis_. USNM 7638, a hatchling, has\r\nlarge whitish dots surrounded by blackish dots confined to the\r\nposterior half of the carapace, and the locality for this specimen is\r\nmerely Río Bravo (= Río Grande). CNHM 47366, a hatchling from Sierra\r\nde las Palmas (Sierra de Santa Rosa, La Palma), Coahuila, has a few,\r\nsmall, blackish dots, irregularly spaced, on the anterior half of the\r\ncarapace, but other dots more evenly distributed on the posterior half\r\nwhere they are intermixed with whitish dots. The drawing of the dorsal\r\nview of a hatchling _emoryi_ (Agassiz, 1857:Pl. 6, Fig. 4) shows a\r\nsprinkling of blackish dots on the anterior half of the carapace. A\r\nhatchling from Eagle Pass (USNM 116578) does not have a noticeably\r\nwidened pale rim posteriorly on the carapace, and is not\r\ndistinguishable from _pallidus_. See account of _T. s. guadalupensis_\r\nfor further comments on intergradation.\r\n\r\nA soft-shelled turtle that was obtained in the Sacramento River by\r\nthree fishermen, near Sacramento, California, was named _Aspidonectes\r\ncaliforniana_ by Rivers (1889:233). A comparison (with _Aspidonectes\r\nspinifer_ and _A. emoryi_) of certain features of the skull was\r\nlargely prepared by Baur and included in the description (_op.\r\ncit._:234-35); seemingly, the most trenchant character of the skull of\r\n_californiana_ was the enlarged alveolar surfaces of the jaws. This\r\nfeature prompted Baur (1893:220) to refer _californiana_ to the genus\r\n_Pelodiscus_, which also included _agassizi_ (skulls also having jaws\r\nwith enlarged alveolar surfaces) and several Old World species. Van\r\nDenburgh (1917) discussed the origin of the specimen that formed the\r\nbasis of River's description and concluded that it was brought over\r\nfrom China. Siebenrock (1924:192) and Mertens and Wermuth (1955:389)\r\nlisted _Aspidonectes californiana_ as a synonym of _emoryi_. River's\r\ndescription is not that of _emoryi_; the enlarged alveolar surfaces of\r\nthe jaws, and the dark carapace having tubercular ridges suggest a\r\nresemblance to _T. ferox_. The papillae on the neck are not found in\r\nany American species. Miller (1946:46, footnote 2) believed that \"it\r\nobviously was introduced, apparently from China,\" and cited Pope\r\n(1935:61), who declared the specimen to represent _Trionyx sinensis_.\r\n\r\nSchmidt (1924:64) first reported the occurrence of _T. s. emoryi_ west\r\nof the continental divide in Arizona and suggested that it was highly\r\nprobable that the species had been introduced near Phoenix in recent\r\nyears. Cowles and Bogert (1936:42) mentioned a species of softshell\r\noccurring in the Boulder Dam region and presumed the species to be\r\nnative to Asia and introduced by the Chinese. Linsdale and Gressitt\r\n(1937:222) determined the status of the species in the Colorado River\r\ndrainage as _T. s. emoryi_. The discussions by Dill (1944:179-81) and\r\nMiller (1946:46) indicate that _emoryi_ was introduced into the Gila\r\nRiver (Colorado River drainage) in western New Mexico near the turn of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\n_T. s. emoryi_ and _T. ater_ are the only kinds of softshells\r\noccurring in México. The colloquial name for soft-shelled turtles in\r\nMéxico is \"tortuga blanca.\" This name is also used in reference to the\r\nCentral American river turtle, _Dermatemys mawei_, which occurs on the\r\neast coast of México as far north as Veracruz.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 275, as follows: ARIZONA: _Maricopa_:\r\nCNHM 4768, KU 2214-19, 2803, 2824, 2837, 2903-07, 2909-16 (2914, 2\r\nspecimens), 2918-29, 3118-27, 3129, 3147-56, USNM 71627, Salt River,\r\nPhoenix. _Pinal_: UI 37713, Gila River, 6 mi.

See comments under subsection entitled \"Remarks\" and\r\nFig. 19.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of white dots that are conspicuous on\r\nanterior half of carapace, and usually as large as those on posterior\r\nhalf; white dots, sometimes 3 millimeters in diameter, encircled with\r\nblackish ocelli in adult males.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 3.3 centimeters\r\n(ANSP 16717); of largest male, 13.5 centimeters (TU 10162); of largest\r\nfemale, 22.0 centimeters (TU 10160).\r\n\r\nHatchlings having white dots on anterior half of carapace; white dots\r\nanteriorly nearly as large as those posteriorly, encircled with\r\nblackish ocelli, and conspicuous on dark background (ANSP 16717, Pl.\r\n41; USNM 78515-16; Stebbins, 1954:181, Pl. 26B), or smaller than those\r\nposteriorly, not encircled with dusky ocelli, and inconspicuous on\r\npale background (TNHC 1446); pale rim of carapace less than four times\r\nas wide posteriorly as laterally.\r\n\r\nAdult males resembling holotype; size of white tubercles on carapace\r\nvariable; most, if not all, tubercles surrounded by narrow blackish\r\nocelli, or parts thereof; largest white tubercles or dots in most\r\nspecimens exceeding one millimeter and in some specimens three\r\nmillimeters in diameter (TU 10163); white dots often slightly elongate\r\n(UMMZ 89917, 89920, 89926; TU 10152, 10145); juvenal pattern of white\r\ndots seemingly more contrasting in _guadalupensis_, owing to dark\r\nground color of carapace, than in _pallidus_ or _emoryi_ that have\r\npale brown or tan carapaces; small tubercles along anterior edge of\r\ncarapace rounded, obtuse, wartlike, never conical; sharp tips often\r\nlacking (TU 10153).\r\n\r\nLarge females often having whitish spots on anterior half of carapace\r\n(TU 10160, Pl. 42, upper, right; 10142); carapace dark having\r\nill-defined mottled and blotched pattern; tubercles along anterior\r\nedge of carapace low, rounded, rarely equilateral, never conical;\r\nsmall blackish dots rarely on surface of carapace (UMMZ 89923).\r\n\r\nPattern on side of head and snout of little diagnostic value;\r\npostocular stripe usually interrupted, but configuration variable,\r\nconsisting of pale anterior, dark-bordered segment (just behind eye);\r\nposterior segment of postocular stripe usually less well-defined and\r\ngenerally blending with adjacent ground color; pale postocular stripe\r\nsometimes uninterrupted and dark-bordered throughout its length (TU\r\n10157, 10159, 10176); pattern on dorsal surface of snout variable;\r\npattern usually consisting of uninterrupted dark line (slightly curved\r\nanteriorly) connecting anterior margins of orbits (TU 10161, 10164,\r\n10159, 10143), or dark line interrupted (TU 10153, 10154, 10176),\r\nabsent (TU 10163), or present in addition to dark inner borders of\r\npale stripes that extend anteriorly from eyes (TU 10149, 10162);\r\nsmall, often fine, dark markings, on dorsal surface of limbs,\r\nespecially forelimbs; ventral surface of plastron and soft parts of\r\nbody usually whitish, lacking markings; small blackish spots\r\noccasionally in region of bridge (TU 10149); dark marks occurring on\r\nwebbing of limbs and often encroaching on soles and palms.\r\n\r\nOntogenetic variation in PL/HW, mean PL/HW of specimens having\r\nplastral lengths 7.0 centimeters or less, 3.83, and exceeding 7.0\r\ncentimeters, 5.18; ontogenetic variation in CL/CW, mean CL/CW of\r\nspecimens having plastron lengths 8.5 centimeters or less, 1.14, and\r\nexceeding 8.5 centimeters, 1.22; mean CL/PCW, 2.11; mean HW/SL, 1.38\r\n(including subspecies _pallidus_); mean CL/PL, 1.37.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Two hatchlings (ANSP 13447, Bexar County; TNHC 1446,\r\nMcMullen County) more closely resemble _pallidus_ than\r\n_guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\nSome individuals from the Colorado River drainage have features\r\nsuggesting those that are characteristic of _pallidus_. Large females\r\nhave obtuse, knoblike somewhat triangular-shaped tubercles along the\r\nanterior edge of the carapace, which are never conelike (TU 14439-40,\r\n10187, 16036.1; BCB 6010). The tubercles along the anterior edge of\r\nthe carapace are more elevated than in turtles from drainage systems\r\nwest of the Colorado. Whitish spots are usually absent anteriorly on\r\nthe carapace, but may be evident through the mottled pattern of large\r\nfemales (BCB 6010, plastral length, 19.7 cm.). The pale postocular\r\nstripe is usually interrupted, whereas the dark line connecting the\r\nanterior margins of the orbits is usually not interrupted; the two\r\ncharacters last mentioned show alliance with _guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\nThe carapace of hatchlings from the Colorado River is pale having\r\nwhitish dots, smaller anteriorly than posteriorly, which may be\r\nencircled with dusky ocelli (TNHC 20257) or not (ANSP 11889, BCB 5055,\r\nSM 3282). Many hatchlings are not distinguishable from _pallidus_\r\n(TCWC 7262, TNHC 4975, SM 4924, 6106). I have not seen hatchlings from\r\nthe Colorado River that resemble ANSP 16717.\r\n\r\nThe pattern on the carapace of adult males from the Colorado River\r\ndrainage resembles that of _guadalupensis_ (Pl. 41, bottom, right) but\r\nthe whitish dots are usually smaller and may not be encircled with\r\nblackish ocelli (BCB 4066, TU 14485). An adult male (TU 14476) from\r\nthe South Fork of the Llano River has whitish dots three millimeters\r\nin diameter and encircled with blackish ocelli (_guadalupensis_),\r\nwhereas another adult male (USNM 83690) from a tributary of the\r\nColorado, the South Concho River, resembles _pallidus_.\r\n\r\nEight specimens from the San Saba River (TU 14419 [6 specimens],\r\n14439-40), that range in plastral length from 6.8 to 17.0 centimeters\r\nare impressive because of the dark brownish coloration on the\r\ncarapace. The smallest individual, which is also the only male in the\r\nseries, is paler. The mottled and blotched pattern on the females is\r\ntherefore not contrasting; the largest females have elevated whitish\r\nprominences in the center of the carapace posteriorly. An immature\r\nmale (UMMZ 70348) from the South Concho River also has a dark brown\r\ncarapace, and lacks white dots. The dark coloration of the carapace of\r\nthese specimens recalls the TU series of _T. s. emoryi_ from the Pecos\r\nRiver, Terrell County, Texas.\r\n\r\nColor notes taken from a freshly-killed adult female from the Llano\r\nRiver, two miles west Llano (TU 16036.1, Pl. 42), are: pattern on\r\ncarapace of dark olive or blackish marks that form an irregular\r\nreticulum or marbling on a paler background that varies from brownish\r\nto buff and has an orange or reddish tinge in some areas; small\r\nwhitish spots posteriorly; pale rim yellowish, evident only at sides\r\nof carapace; dorsal surface of soft parts of body olive-green,\r\nbecoming paler with yellowish tinge toward insertions of limbs and\r\nneck; no contrasting pattern on limbs or neck and head; yellowish on\r\nsides of body; ventral surface whitish lacking dark marks, yellowish\r\nat region of bridge, axillary region and on neck; chin olive-yellow.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. s. guadalupensis_ can be distinguished from all\r\nother subspecies of _T. spinifer_ in having: (1) large white dots,\r\nsometimes three millimeters in diameter, on a dark background usually\r\nsurrounded with blackish ocelli and conspicuous on the anterior half\r\nof the carapace (some as large as those on posterior half) in adult\r\nmales, and (2) whitish dots on the anterior half of the carapace, in\r\nhatchlings, that are often encircled with dark ocelli. _T. s.\r\nguadalupensis_ resembles _pallidus_ and _emoryi_ in having white\r\ntubercles or dots on the carapace and therein differs from _spinifer_,\r\n_hartwegi_ and _asper_. _T. s. guadalupensis_ resembles _pallidus_ but\r\ndiffers from _emoryi_ in having a pale rim that is less than four\r\ntimes wider posteriorly than laterally. _T. s. guadalupensis_\r\nresembles _emoryi_ but differs from _pallidus_, _spinifer_, _hartwegi_\r\nand _asper_ in having along the anterior edge of the carapace\r\ntubercles that are flattened or wartlike prominences often lacking\r\nsharp tips in adult males; these tubercles are never conical in large\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n_T. s. guadalupensis_ has a wide head, a feature shared with the\r\nsubspecies _asper_ and _emoryi_, but differs from _emoryi_ in having a\r\nwider carapace. _T. s. guadalupensis_ resembles _emoryi_ and\r\n_pallidus_ but differs from the other subspecies in having the\r\ncarapace widest farther posterior than one-half the length of the\r\ncarapace. The length of snout in _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_ is\r\nshorter than in _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_ but is longer than in\r\n_emoryi_. _T. s. guadalupensis_ differs from _asper_ but resembles the\r\nother subspecies in having a relatively long plastron.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Some individuals of _guadalupensis_ have characteristics\r\nthat are applicable to _emoryi_. TNHC 12352 (Llano River) a hatchling,\r\nhas conspicuous white dots confined to the posterior third of the\r\ncarapace; the pale rim, however, is not widened posteriorly. TU 10156\r\n(Guadalupe River) has a conspicuously widened pale rim on the carapace\r\nthat is approximately 3.4 times wider posteriorly (8.5 mm.) than\r\nlaterally (2.5 mm.).\r\n\r\n_T. s. guadalupensis_ more closely resembles _pallidus_ than _emoryi_.\r\nTurtles living in rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico east of\r\nthe Guadalupe-San Antonio river system successively show increasing\r\nresemblance to _pallidus_ from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe expression of intergradation between _guadalupensis_ and\r\n_pallidus_ is of a clinal nature that involves parallel changes in the\r\npattern on the snout, side of head, limbs (to a lesser degree),\r\ntuberculation along the anterior edge of the carapace, size of whitish\r\ntubercles or dots, and the distinctness of the blackish ocelli that\r\nsurround the whitish dots on the carapace. These characters form a\r\nwell-marked gradation or cline that extends over a considerable area.\r\nThere is, however, no continuous environmental gradient because the\r\npopulations are relatively isolated by occupying adjacent drainage\r\nsystems. The sharpest break in the gradation of characters mentioned\r\nabove occurs between the Colorado River and Brazos River drainages.\r\nThe population of softshells in the Colorado River drainage is\r\nactually an intergradient one, but more closely resembles\r\n_guadalupensis_, whereas the population in the Brazos River drainage\r\nmore closely resembles _pallidus_. For convenience the turtles\r\ninhabiting the Colorado River drainage are referred to _guadalupensis_\r\nand those in the Brazos River drainage to _pallidus_. Some individuals\r\nfrom farther west than the Colorado River drainage will resemble\r\n_pallidus_, and a few individuals from father east than the Brazos\r\nRiver drainage will resemble _guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\nThe gradation of some of the characters mentioned above terminates in\r\nthe subspecies _emoryi_. It, however, has characters not found in\r\n_pallidus_ or _guadalupensis_, and is more distinct from either of\r\nthose subspecies than either is from each other; the difference in\r\ncharacters as well as the break in the gradient of characters between\r\n_guadalupensis_ in the Nueces River drainage and _emoryi_ in the Río\r\nGrande drainage is greater than that between _guadalupensis_ in the\r\nColorado and _pallidus_ in the Brazos River drainages.\r\n\r\nI have refrained from designating individuals between these three\r\nsubspecies (_emoryi_, _guadalupensis_ and _pallidus_) as \"intergrades\"\r\non the distribution maps, and only mention (in text) those individuals\r\nwhose characters show a decided tendency toward the adjacent\r\nsubspecies.

The Brazos River drainage is inhabited by a population that\r\nmore closely resembles _pallidus_ than _guadalupensis_ (see comments\r\nunder subsection entitled \"Remarks\"; see map, Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of white dots that are usually absent or\r\ninconspicuous, but sometimes distinct and small, on anterior third of\r\ncarapace, and not surrounded with dark ocelli; white dots often absent\r\non posterior half of carapace of hatchlings; white spots, rarely as\r\nlarge as two millimeters in diameter, not encircled with black ocelli\r\non adult males; pale rim of carapace less than four times wider\r\nposteriorly than laterally.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 3.3 centimeters\r\n(KU 50832); of largest male, 16.0 centimeters (SM 2375); of largest\r\nfemale, 30.5 centimeters (TU 13213).\r\n\r\nSurface of carapace in hatchlings uniform pale brown or tan; small\r\nwhite tubercles absent or inconspicuous on anterior half of carapace,\r\nbut evident on posterior half of carapace, sometimes well-defined (TU\r\n481), but usually inconspicuous (TU 678, 490); pale rim of carapace\r\nless than four times wider posteriorly than laterally.\r\n\r\nAdult males resembling description of holotype; small whitish\r\ntubercles or dots rarely two millimeters in diameter on posterior half\r\nof carapace, smaller and usually inconspicuous on anterior half of\r\ncarapace (TU 13281, 486); well-defined whitish tubercles occasionally\r\non anterior half of carapace (KU 40174); white tubercles not\r\nsurrounded with black ocelli; pattern of white dots seemingly less\r\ncontrasting in _pallidus_ than in _guadalupensis_, owing to pale brown\r\nor tan carapace; small tubercles along anterior edge of carapace\r\nequilateral or conical having sharp tips.\r\n\r\nLarge females usually having pale brown carapaces with slightly\r\ncontrasting, brownish, mottled and blotched, patterns; white\r\nprominences often evident posteriorly and anteriorly in middle of\r\ncarapace and in nuchal region; tubercles along anterior edge of\r\ncarapace equilateral or conical in shape.\r\n\r\nPattern on side of head and snout variable and of no diagnostic value;\r\npostocular stripe uninterrupted having dark borders (UMMZ 92754), or\r\ninterrupted having pale segment behind eye (TU 13282); other\r\nvariations in pattern shown on TU 10170 and 15818; pale stripes on\r\nsnout having dark inner borders that join and form acute angle (TU\r\n381), or lacking dark inner borders and having uninterrupted dark line\r\nconnecting anterior margins of orbits (TU 13280); other variations in\r\npattern on snout shown on TU 1232, 1291 and 15819; specimens\r\nrepresenting illustrations of variation in pattern on snout (Fig. 5 d,\r\ne, f) all from same locality, Lewisville, Lafayette County, Arkansas;\r\ncontrasting pattern on side of head of dark marks on pale background;\r\ncontrasting pattern of dark marks on dorsal surface of limbs; markings\r\non hind limbs generally larger than those on forelimbs; small or fine\r\nmarkings of some specimens reducing contrast in pattern (TU 478, 488);\r\ncarapace sometimes having few small blackish dots confined to margin\r\n(CNHM 15474, TU 487, 1253, 13266); ventral surface of plastron and\r\nsoft parts of body whitish and usually lacking dark markings; small\r\nblackish marks often occurring on flap of carapace, in region of\r\nbridge, or on chin and throat (TU 399, 469, 475, 472, 13281).\r\n\r\nOntogenetic variation in PL/HW, mean PL/HW of specimens having\r\nplastral lengths 7.0 centimeters or less, 4.15, and exceeding 7.0\r\ncentimeters, 5.32; ontogenetic variation in CL/CW, mean CL/CW of\r\nspecimens having plastral lengths 8.5 centimeters or less, 1.10, and\r\nexceeding 8.5 centimeters, 1.14; mean CL/PCW, 2.12; mean HW/SL, 1.38\r\n(including subspecies _guadalupensis_); mean CL/PL, 1.36.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--In 1953, I casually glanced at a hatchling softshell\r\nfrom the Calcasieu River drainage in the private collection of Mr.\r\nWilfred T. Neill; the specimen was considered by Neill (1951:15) as\r\n\"... an intergradient one (with the _hartwegi-spinifer_ population in\r\nthe lower Mississippi drainage).\" The hatchling does deviate from\r\n\"typical\" _pallidus_ in having darkish flecks posteriorly on the\r\ncarapace.\r\n\r\nI have seen only one adult male (USNM 94457) from the Sabine River\r\ndrainage (Orange County, Texas) that shows characteristics of\r\n_guadalupensis_ (white dots on carapace encircled with small black\r\nocelli); another adult male (USNM 94456) from the same locality\r\nresembles _pallidus_. Those two USNM specimens were mentioned by Neill\r\n(1951:13) as indicating intergradation with \"... the mixed\r\n_spinifera-hartwegi-asper_ populations of Louisiana.\"\r\n\r\nTwo adult males (SM 2889, Pl. 40, bottom, left, and TCWC 471, Trinity\r\nRiver drainage) have blackish ocelli surrounding the white dots on the\r\nposterior part of the carapace; two large females (TU 14402, Pl. 40,\r\nbottom, right, plastral length, 17.5 cm., and TU 14417 plastral\r\nlength, 21.3 cm., both from the Trinity River) have contrasting\r\nmottled and blotched patterns with white dots visible on the carapace.\r\nThese turtles show alliance with _guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\nSome individuals from the Brazos River drainage have features\r\nsuggesting those that are characteristic of _guadalupensis_.\r\nHatchlings may have large white dots on the anterior half of the\r\ncarapace (USNM 55601). Adult males may have dusky ocelli surrounding\r\nthe white dots on the carapace (TU 14169, 14559.1, 14559.2). The\r\nwhitish dots, rarely as large as two millimeters, are never so large\r\nas in _guadalupensis_ (three mm. in diameter), and are usually smaller\r\nanteriorly than posteriorly; TU 14169 has white dots approximately the\r\nsame size (1.2 mm.) on the anterior half as on the posterior half of\r\nthe carapace. The tubercles on adult males are equilateral or\r\nsubconical, usually having sharp tips (TU 14348, 14559.1, 14559.2);\r\nthe tubercles on large females are subconical, resembling the end of a\r\nbullet, and, in both sexes the tubercles are less conical than those\r\non specimens of _pallidus_ from farther east.\r\n\r\nThree specimens from the Brazos River drainage are particularly\r\nimpressive in their alliance with _guadalupensis_. SM 2556, an adult\r\nmale, has large white dots that are encircled with black ocelli on the\r\nposterior half of the carapace, but lacks white dots on the anterior\r\nhalf. TNHC 14068, a hatchling, has small black dots interspersed with\r\nthe larger white dots posteriorly. CNHM 46289 has large white spots on\r\nthe carapace that are surrounded with two to four black dots;\r\nscattered black dots also intermix with white spots on the surface of\r\nthe carapace (less extensive anteriorly).\r\n\r\nColor notes taken from a freshly-killed adult male (KU 47121) from the\r\nBrazos River, seven miles below Whitney Dam, Bosque-Hill county line,\r\nTexas, are: Carapace pale brown or tan bordered by black line, having\r\npale lemon yellow rim; yellowish-cream spots on carapace faintly\r\nsurrounded with black stippling; dorsal surface of soft parts of body\r\nolive having black marks and patches of grayish; webbing on limbs\r\nhaving golden or yellowish hue, brighter distally; interorbital region\r\nbrown; black-bordered, postocular stripe orange-cream; snout and side\r\nof head olive having pale areas of orange-cream; iris cream having\r\nblack stripe; yellowish at juncture of dark dorsal and pale ventral\r\ncoloration with orangish tinge on forelimbs and head; tail pale brown\r\nor tan, flanked by black borders that suffuse laterally into\r\nlemon-yellow; undersurface whitish, pale yellow on neck, bluish-gray\r\non throat.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. s. pallidus_ most closely resembles _T. s.\r\nguadalupensis_, but can be distinguished from that subspecies in\r\nhaving small white tubercles, rarely two millimeters in diameter, on a\r\npale background, that are not surrounded by blackish ocelli, and are\r\nusually absent, or not conspicuous on the anterior third of the\r\ncarapace in adult males; also there are usually no conspicuous white\r\ntubercles or dots on the anterior third of the carapace in hatchlings.\r\nMany adult males of _pallidus_ from the Brazos and some from the\r\nTrinity River drainages often have dusky or black ocelli surrounding\r\nthe white dots posteriorly on the carapace; males from these river\r\nsystems may be distinguished from _guadalupensis_ in having most, if\r\nnot all, white dots on the anterior half of the carapace smaller than\r\nthose posteriorly, and a pale brown carapace (in life, usually darker\r\nin _guadalupensis_). _T. s. pallidus_ (and _guadalupensis_) is\r\ndistinguished from _emoryi_ in lacking a widened pale rim posteriorly,\r\nand in having small white spots on the anterior half of the carapace.\r\n_T. s. pallidus_ resembles _guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ in having\r\nwhite spots on the carapace in adult males. _T. s. pallidus_ differs\r\nfrom _spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_ in lacking blackish dots or\r\nocelli that occur in the center of the carapace. _T. s. pallidus_\r\nresembles _emoryi_ but differs from _guadalupensis_ in lacking black\r\nocelli surrounding the white spots. _T. s. pallidus_ resembles\r\n_spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_ but differs from _guadalupensis_\r\nand _emoryi_ in having tubercles along the anterior edge of the\r\ncarapace that are conical having sharp tips in males, and conical in\r\nlarge females.\r\n\r\n_T. s. pallidus_ resembles _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_ but differs from\r\nthe other subspecies in having a narrow head. _T. s. pallidus_ differs\r\nfrom _emoryi_ but resembles the other subspecies in having a wider\r\ncarapace. _T. s. pallidus_ resembles _emoryi_ and _guadalupensis_, and\r\ndiffers from the other subspecies in having the carapace widest\r\nfarther posterior than one-half the length of the carapace. The snout\r\nof _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_ is shorter than in _spinifer_ and\r\n_hartwegi_, but longer than in _emoryi_. _T. s. pallidus_ differs from\r\n_asper_ but resembles the other subspecies in having a relatively long\r\nplastron.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Intergradation of the subspecies _pallidus_ and\r\n_guadalupensis_ is of a clinal nature in which populations\r\nsuccessively show a gradual resemblance to _guadalupensis_ from\r\nwestern Louisiana and eastern Texas westward to central Texas. Because\r\nthe sharpest break in this cline of characters occurs between the\r\nColorado and Brazos River drainages, the turtles living in the Brazos\r\nRiver drainage and eastward are referred to _pallidus_, whereas those\r\nin the Colorado River drainage and westward are referred to\r\n_guadalupensis_. For further comments on intergradation between these\r\ntwo subspecies, see the account of _T. s. guadalupensis_.\r\n\r\nTaylor (1935:217-18) reported on some specimens of _Amyda spinifera_\r\nthat were obtained by Mr. R. E. McEntyre in \"... the spring and summer\r\nof 1926, chiefly about Lewisville, Lafayette County (Arkansas).\" Of\r\nthe catalog numbers listed by Taylor from Lewisville, 58 (KU,\r\nalcoholic) represent _pallidus_. Three, having the same locality data,\r\nhave features that are characteristic of _hartwegi_. KU 2944 (one of\r\nthree specimens having this catalog number) is a female having a pale,\r\nmottled and blotched carapace approximately one foot in length; there\r\nare remnants of two dark ocelli, and many widely-scattered,\r\nwell-defined dark spots near the periphery of the carapace. KU 2963\r\n(one of three specimens having this catalog number) is an adult male\r\nthat has solid, blackish dots on the entire surface of the carapace.\r\nKU 2964 (one of two specimens with this catalog number) is an adult\r\nmale that has ocelli approximately five millimeters in diameter on the\r\ncarapace (indistinct in center of carapace).\r\n\r\nLewisville is situated in the drainage basin of the Red River and is\r\napproximately eight miles east of the Red River and 30 miles west of\r\nthe westernmost tributary of the Ouachita River drainage. _T. s.\r\npallidus_ occurs in the Red River drainage; _hartwegi_ occurs in the\r\nOuachita River drainage. Perhaps there is intergradation between\r\n_pallidus_ and _hartwegi_ in the intervening streams. There is no data\r\nto indicate from which river or stream each specimen obtained by\r\nMcEntyre came; one would presume that all specimens came from the Red\r\nRiver drainage. But this is not certain. Certainly the 47 specimens\r\ndesignated herein as _pallidus_ came from the Red River drainage. I\r\nsuspect that KU 2944, 2963 and 2964 were obtained from tributaries of\r\nthe Ouachita River drainage.\r\n\r\n_T. s. pallidus_ intergrades with the _spinifer-hartwegi_ population\r\nwhere the Red River joins the Mississippi River in the lower\r\nMississippi Valley in Louisiana. The majority of 13 juvenal specimens\r\nfrom the Red River near Shaw, Concordia Parish, Louisiana (USNM\r\n99862-69, 99871-75), resemble _pallidus_ in having inconspicuous white\r\ntubercles on a pale brown carapace. The white tubercles are\r\nconspicuous in USNM 99871. Some specimens have a few small dark dots\r\nconfined to the margin of the carapace, as do some \"variant\"\r\nindividuals from well within the geographic range of _pallidus_. USNM\r\n99865 is referred to _hartwegi_ because the carapace is covered with\r\ndark ocelli approximately one millimeter in diameter. Some specimens\r\nfrom farther west in the Red River drainage are referred to\r\n_hartwegi_. One (USNM 100420) of three from Natchitoches Parish,\r\nLouisiana (TU 5763, USNM 100420-21), having blackish dots on the\r\ncarapace, is applicable to _hartwegi_. Of two turtles from Grant\r\nParish, Louisiana (TU 5647, 12735), only 12735 has dark dots and\r\nocelli (_hartwegi_). One specimen from Rapides Parish, Louisiana (TU\r\n14040), having dark dots on the entire surface of the carapace, is\r\nreferred to _hartwegi_.\r\n\r\nMost specimens from the lower Atchafalaya River drainage are referable\r\nto _pallidus_. Eastward, intergradation occurs with the\r\n_spinifer-hartwegi_ population; USNM 100089-90 from Assumption Parish,\r\nnear Napoleonville, Louisiana, are referred to _pallidus_. TU 11983,\r\nfrom Bayou Lafourche, Raceland, La Fourche Parish, and TU 13698.11,\r\nfrom Bayou Gauche in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, are juvenal males\r\nthat combine the characteristics of _pallidus_ and _hartwegi_; the\r\ncarapaces are covered with blackish spots and posteriorly have\r\ndistinct whitish dots. The population in the Atchafalaya River more\r\nclosely resembles _pallidus_ than it does _hartwegi_ or _spinifer_. In\r\nformer times the Atchafalaya River was presumably continuous solely\r\nwith the Red River (inhabited by _pallidus_). Now, these two rivers\r\nand the Mississippi River are interconnected in east-central\r\nLouisiana. A large volume of water of the Mississippi drainage is\r\nconveyed to the Gulf of Mexico by the Atchafalaya, and someone has\r\nsaid that by approximately 1975, unless man interferes, two-thirds to\r\nthree-fourths of the total volume of water of the Mississippi River\r\nwill be drained by the Atchafalaya. One can expect, therefore, an\r\nincrease in the influence of the _hartwegi-spinifer_ population in the\r\nAtchafalaya River drainage.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 270, as follows: ARKANSAS: _Lafayette_:\r\nKU 2930-37, 2939-40, 2942, 2944 (two of three specimens bear this\r\ncatalog number), 2945-57, 2958 (2), 2959-61, 2963 (two of three\r\nspecimens bear this catalog number), 2964 (one of two specimens bears\r\nthis catalog number), 2965-73, 2987-89, 3056, Lewisville.\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA: _Acadia_: USNM 100151-59, Mermentau River. _Assumption_:\r\nUSNM 100089-90, Bayou Lafourche, \"near\" Napoleonville. _Beauregard_:\r\nTU 1231-32, 1253-55, 1291, 13211, 13266, Sabine River, 8 mi.

Legler (and party),\r\nSeptember 6, 1958.\r\n\r\n_Range._--Basin of Cuatro Ciénegas, central Coahuila, Mexico (see map,\r\nFig. 22).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Posterior margin of carapace of some females having fine\r\ncorrugations, edge often ragged, and no pale outer margin; septal\r\nridges reduced in adult males; over-all dorsal coloration (in\r\npreservative) dark, lacking contrasting patterns.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of adult male, 9.6 centimeters (KU\r\n46911); of largest female, 18.4 centimeters (KU 46903).\r\n\r\nAdult male: anterior edge of carapace smooth; septal ridges reduced;\r\npale outer rim, and small, whitish, dots posteriorly on carapace;\r\nsurface of carapace slightly gritty or sandpapery posteriorly; snout\r\nbroadened; over-all dorsal coloration dark gray or slate; contrasting\r\npattern on soft parts of body lacking; ventral surface whitish having\r\nfew blackish marks posteriorly on undersurface of carapace.\r\n\r\nFemales: posterior margin of carapace usually having fine\r\ncorrugations; edge of carapace posteriorly often ragged; pale rim of\r\ncarapace absent; mottled and blotched pattern not contrasting on\r\nblackish carapace; dorsal surface of soft parts of body dark gray or\r\nslate, lacking contrasting pattern; ventral surface of carapace and\r\nposterior part of plastron usually having many blackish flecks and\r\nmarkings; tubercles lacking on anterior edge and in center of carapace\r\nposteriorly; septal ridges well developed.\r\n\r\nMedial angle of epiplastron (as observed through overlying skin) bent\r\nat angle of approximately 90 degrees. Other osteological characters\r\npresumably as in _spinifer_.\r\n\r\nRange in length of plastron (cm.) of 11 females (mean follows\r\nextremes); 10.8-18.4, 15.0; proportional measurements of 12 specimens\r\n(including adult male, mean follows extremes): PL/HW, 4.70-5.43, 4.93;\r\nCL/CW, 1.28-1.43, 1.32; CL/PCW, 1.98-2.42, 2.15; HW/SL, 1.22-1.58,\r\n1.37; CL/PL, 1.29-1.44, 1.36; some females (especially KU 46908) have\r\nnoticeably elongate carapaces.\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Corrugations best developed on two largest females (KU\r\n46903, 46906), even present on ventral surface of carapace posteriorly\r\nand on dorsal surface of tail; development of corrugations not\r\nontogenetic phenomenon as posterior margin relatively smooth on KU\r\n46908 (plastral length, 16.0 cm.) but relatively rugose on KU 46909,\r\nwhich is smaller (plastral length, 13.9 cm.); smallest female (KU\r\n46904) and adult male having posterior margin smooth; smallest female\r\nhaving indication of pale outer rim and small whitish dots posteriorly\r\non carapace, and dark, obtusely-angular line, connecting anterior\r\nmargins of orbits; blackish marks on ventral surface reduced on KU\r\n46904, 46910, 46912, and UI 43510; UI 43510 (plastral length, 16.3\r\ncm.) resembles _T. s. emoryi_ in having more contrasting mottled\r\npattern on carapace and limbs, indication of pale outer rim on\r\ncarapace, and dark line connecting anterior margins of orbits; ventral\r\nsurface of tail and hind limbs often tinged with red.\r\n\r\nColor notes from life of young female, topotype (KU 53755) are:\r\nmottled carapace dark brown, pale areas buff; dorsal surface of head\r\nmottled, olive-brown, pale areas buff; iris orange-buff; upper and\r\nlower lips yellow-orange; dorsal surface of limbs olive-brown having\r\nyellow to buff suffusion and small blackish marks; pale areas on\r\nwebbing yellow; ventral surface whitish having yellow at margin of\r\ncarapace, on neck and limbs.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. ater_ most closely resembles _T. spinifer_\r\n(especially the subspecies _emoryi_) in having a gritty or\r\n\"sandpapery\" carapace (reduced, tubercles more scattered), whitish\r\ndots on posterior third of carapace (small females and adult male) and\r\na dark line connecting anterior margins of orbits (smallest female).\r\nPrior to acquiring the characteristic darkened, dorsal ground color,\r\nthe pattern on the head and limbs seems to be that of _T. s. emoryi_.\r\n\r\n_T. ater_ resembles _T. muticus_ in having reduced septal ridges in\r\nmales, a smooth anterior edge of carapace (especially males), and no\r\nenlarged prominences on the anterior edge of the carapace or\r\nposteriorly in the center of the carapace on large females. _T. ater_\r\nresembles _T. ferox_ in having an over-all dark coloration dorsally\r\nwith no contrasting patterns on adults.\r\n\r\n_T. ater_ probably is a small species resembling _T. muticus_ and _T.\r\nspinifer emoryi_. The head is wide in _T. ater_, resembling that of\r\n_T. ferox_, and closely approaching that of _T. spinifer emoryi_ and\r\n_T. s. guadalupensis_. _T. ater_ resembles _T. ferox_ and _T. s.\r\nemoryi_ in having a narrow carapace. _T. ater_ resembles _T. s.\r\nemoryi_, _T. s. guadalupensis_ and _T. s. pallidus_, but differs from\r\n_T. muticus_, _T. ferox_ and the other subspecies of _T. spinifer_ in\r\nhaving the carapace widest farther posterior than one-half the length\r\nof the carapace. _T. ater_ resembles _T. ferox_ and _T. s. emoryi_ in\r\nshortness of snout. The plastron is short in _T. ater_ and most\r\nclosely resembles that of _T. s. pallidus_, _T. s. guadalupensis_, and\r\n_T. s. emoryi_.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--_T. ater_ is confined to permanent, clear-water ponds in\r\nthe basin of Cuatro Ciénegas. The male and 11 females (KU) were taken\r\nat the type locality (a pond known locally as Tío Candido); the other\r\nfemale (UI 43510) was taken from a pond approximately seven miles\r\nnorthward (known locally as Anteojo). _T. spinifer emoryi_ also occurs\r\nin the basin of Cuatro Ciénegas. Males and females of _emoryi_ were\r\ncollected in the Río Mesquites (Río Salado drainage) that drains the\r\nbasin; two adult males of _emoryi_ were taken from the clear-water\r\nponds--one from the type locality of _ater_ (KU 46907), and the other\r\n(KU 53757) from a pond (known locally as El Mojarral) from which no\r\n_ater_ were obtained. This demonstrated sympatry indicates that the\r\ntwo kinds are not conspecific.\r\n\r\nHowever, the nature and frequency of occurrence of characters of _T.\r\nater_, suggest that it is subspecifically related to _T. spinifer_--in\r\neffect, a darkened race of _T. s. emoryi_. The diagnostic characters\r\nof fine corrugations on the posterior margin of the carapace and\r\nblackish marks on the ventral surface do not occur on every female of\r\n_ater_. Too, the dorsal coloration of living females (dark brown-buff)\r\nis paler than that of preserved specimens (dark gray-slate).\r\nFurthermore, a hatchling (CNHM 47367) recorded from Cuatro Ciénegas,\r\nAnteojo, is not distinguishable from _emoryi_.\r\n\r\nThe mention of absence of septal ridges in males of _T. ater_ in the\r\noriginal description (Webb and Legler, 1960:22) should be amended. The\r\nseptal ridges in the only known adult male are reduced; a small,\r\nwhitish ridge is present on the medial surface of each nostril, but is\r\nnot conspicuous in anterior view. The one adult male of _ater_ is\r\ndistinguished from _T. s. emoryi_ principally on the over-all dark,\r\ndorsal coloration with concomitant loss of pattern, the noticeably\r\nbroadened snout, and the reduced septal ridges. The last character\r\nmentioned possibly is variable in _ater_ (and in _emoryi_ in this\r\nregion) in view of the variation in development of the ridge on four\r\nmale _emoryi_ from the basin: well-developed on KU 53757 (Mojarral)\r\nand KU 46907 (Tío Candido); reduced on KU 53752 (Río Mesquites),\r\nresembling development in _ater_; and, reduced on right side only on\r\nKU 53753 (Río Mesquites).\r\n\r\nPresumably, the continued erosive action at the headwaters of the Río\r\nSalado has permitted the invasion of this drainage into the formerly\r\nisolated basin of Cuatro Ciénegas. In the basin, however, I know of no\r\nevidence of a direct aquatic contact between the headwater streams and\r\nthe isolated, clear-water, ponds. How _emoryi_ entered the ponds is\r\nunknown. Some of the ponds are tapped by small, man-made, irrigation\r\ncanals, but, so far as I know, these are not connected to the river.\r\nThe ponds have permanent water and are often separated by several\r\nmiles of arid environment. Overland dispersal between waterways is\r\npossible in time of flooding. Local residents tell of the infrequent\r\nsale of softshells in Cuatro Ciénegas, which hints at their dispersal\r\nvia the agency of man. The underlying gypsum substrate of the valley\r\nhas been subjected to considerable erosion; the ponds observed have\r\ndeep holes, and small caverns and grottos. There are conflicting\r\nreports concerning subterranean connections between ponds. Possibly\r\nthere are underwater connections between some ponds and the headwater\r\nstreams of the Río Mesquites. Whatever the dispersal route for\r\n_emoryi_ into the ponds has been, it is strange that the same route\r\nhas not been traversed by _ater_, permitting its occurrence in the Río\r\nMesquites.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of morphological criteria, I suspect that _ater_ and\r\n_emoryi_ are genetically compatible. Possibly there is only sporadic\r\nentrance of _emoryi_ into the ponds inhabited by _ater_, or the\r\naccessible dispersal routes for _emoryi_ have been relatively recent\r\nand there has been insufficient time for genetic adaptation. _T. ater_\r\nis maintained as a full species because of the occurrence of two\r\ndistinct males (KU 46907, _emoryi_, and KU 46911, _ater_) in the same\r\npond (Tío Candido, the type locality). These two specimens are\r\ncontrasted in a photograph accompanying the type description (Webb and\r\nLegler, 1960: Pl. II). The restricted distribution of _ater_, and its\r\ncharacteristics suggest a relict population derived from a\r\n_ferox_-like ancestor that may be in the process of becoming extinct.\r\n\r\nThere are two specimens in the CNHM recorded from Cuatro Ciénegas. One\r\nis a female (CNHM 55661) having a plastral length of 19.0 centimeters,\r\nand no specific locality other than Cuatro Ciénegas. I examined this\r\nspecimen before I knew of the existence of _ater_, and noted no\r\nunusual features; I have not re-examined the specimen. It is\r\nconsidered representative of _emoryi_. The second is a hatchling (CNHM\r\n47367) having a plastral length of 3.2 centimeters, recorded from\r\nCuatro Ciénegas, Anteojo. The carapace is dark tan having small\r\nwhitish dots intermixed with a few indistinct, small, blackish specks\r\nposteriorly. The specimen is indistinguishable from _emoryi_.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 12, as follows: COAHUILA: KU 46903-06,\r\n46908-12, 53755-56, 16 km. S Cuatro Ciénegas; UI 73510, 5.7 mi.

The smooth anterior edge of the carapace\r\ndistinguishes _muticus_ from all other American kinds except _ater_\r\nand some individuals of _T. s. emoryi_. _T. muticus_ resembles only\r\n_ater_ and _ferox_ in usually lacking a well-defined, contrasting\r\npattern of blackish marks on the dorsal surface of the limbs. _T.\r\nmuticus_ resembles _ferox_ and differs from _spinifer_ and _ater_ in\r\nlacking a gritty or \"sandpapery\" carapace on adult males. Adult males\r\nof _T. muticus calvatus_ and some individuals of _T. m. muticus_ from\r\nthe Colorado River in Texas further resemble _ferox_ in having\r\npostocular stripes with thick black borders.\r\n\r\n_T. muticus_ is the smallest species in North America; the maximum\r\nsize of the plastron in adult males is approximately 14.0 centimeters\r\n(16.0 cm. in _spinifer_) and of adult females 21.5 centimeters (31.0\r\ncm. in _spinifer_). Males and females of _muticus_ are sexually mature\r\nat approximately the same size as some _T. s. emoryi_; also, the great\r\ndevelopment of the plastral callosities in _muticus_ corresponds to\r\nthat in some _emoryi_. The head is narrower in _muticus_ than in\r\n_ferox_ or _spinifer_. The carapaces of specimens of _muticus_\r\nexceeding plastral lengths of 8.0 centimeters are wider than those of\r\n_ferox_, _ater_, _T. s. emoryi_ and _T. s. guadalupensis_ of\r\ncorresponding size. _T. muticus_ differs from _ater_ and three\r\nsubspecies of _spinifer_ (_pallidus_, _guadalupensis_, _emoryi_) in\r\nhaving the carapace widest at a plane approximately one-half the\r\nlength of the carapace. The snout is longer in _muticus_ than in\r\n_ferox_ and _spinifer_. _T. muticus_ differs from _ferox_ but\r\nresembles _spinifer_ in having a relatively short plastron.\r\n\r\nThe skulls of _muticus_ differ from those of _ferox_ but resemble\r\nthose of _spinifer_ in usually having the skull widest at the level of\r\nthe squamosals. Skulls of _muticus_ resemble those of _ferox_ but\r\ndiffer from those of _spinifer_ in usually lacking a well-developed\r\nopisthotic-exoccipital spur. Skulls of _muticus_ are different from\r\nthose of _ferox_ and _spinifer_ in having the 1) ventral surface of\r\nthe supraoccipital spine widest proximally, lacking a medial ridge, 2)\r\nforamen magnum ovoid, 3) distal part of opisthotic wing truncate, 4)\r\nlateral condyle of articular surface of quadrate tapered posteriorly,\r\nsmaller than medial articular surface, and 5) maxillaries not in\r\ncontact above premaxillaries.\r\n\r\nPlastrons of _muticus_ differ from those of _spinifer_ and _ferox_ in\r\nhaving an obtusely-angled epiplastron, relatively large callosities\r\nin adults, and a wide hyo-hypoplastral bridge (in relation to length).\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--Agassiz (1857:399) regarded Lesueur's _Trionyx muticus_ as\r\nthe type species of the genus _Amyda_ and the only species known to\r\nbelong to the genus _Amyda_. Stejneger (1944:7, 9, 12) proposed the\r\ngeneric name _Euamyda_ as a new name for the North American _Amyda\r\nmutica_ as understood by Agassiz. _Euamyda_ was proposed for use only\r\nif Agassiz's understanding was found to be correct. Actually,\r\nStejneger thought that the Old World and New World kinds concerned\r\nwere congeneric, and that the type species of the genus _Amyda_ was\r\nthe Old World species _Amyda javanica_ Schweigger (= _Testudo\r\ncartilaginea_ Boddaert).\r\n\r\nIf _Trionyx muticus_ Lesueur is considered to be generically distinct\r\nfrom other soft-shelled turtles, _Euamyda_ Stejneger, 1944, is\r\navailable as a generic name with _Trionyx muticus_ Lesueur, 1827, as\r\nthe type species (by monotypy).\r\n\r\n_Geographical variation._--_Trionyx muticus_ shows no obvious\r\ncharacter gradients; the variation is mostly discontinuous and unlike\r\nthat in _T. spinifer_. On the basis of differences in the juvenal\r\npattern and pattern on head, _T. muticus_ can be divided into two\r\nsubspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trionyx muticus muticus= Lesueur\r\n\r\nMidland Smooth Softshell\r\n\r\nPlates 45, 46, and 53\r\n\r\n     _Trionyx muticus_ Lesueur, Mém.

Lesueur in August, 1827 (Pl.\r\n53).\r\n\r\n_Range._--Central United States; in the Mississippi River drainage\r\nfrom extreme western Pennsylvania, southern Minnesota and South Dakota\r\nsouth to Tennessee, Louisiana and Oklahoma; streams of the Gulf Coast\r\ndrainage from the Mississippi River in Louisiana westward into Texas\r\nincluding the Colorado River drainage (see map, Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of dusky dots and usually short lines or\r\nbacilliform marks; ill-defined pale stripes on snout usually evident\r\njust in front of eyes; pale postocular stripe lacking thick, black\r\nborders that are approximately one-half width of pale stripe (except\r\nsome in the Colorado River drainage of Texas).\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 2.1 centimeters\r\n(INHS 3458); of largest male, 14.0 centimeters (CNHM 92003); of\r\nlargest female, 21.5 centimeters (KU 2308).\r\n\r\nJuvenal pattern of dusky, grayish marks lacking sharp margins, and\r\nusually consisting of both small spots and short streaks or dashes,\r\nthe former predominating; short streaks or dashes occasionally lacking\r\n(TU 14375, Pl. 45, bottom, left; UMMZ 92751); markings variable in\r\nnumber, few and widely spaced, or several and closely approximated\r\n(Pl. 45, top, topotypes); pale rim separated from ground color by\r\nill-defined, dusky margin; pattern on adult males well-defined\r\nresembling that of hatchlings (TU 16172.1, 16173), scarcely\r\ndiscernable (TU 13294), or absent (TU 1242); mottled and blotched\r\npattern on carapace usually contrasting in large females.\r\n\r\nPale stripes extending forward from eyes usually not more than half\r\ndistance to tip of snout; inner borders of pale stripes on snout\r\nusually absent or dusky and indistinct, occasionally blackish (TU\r\n14606); outer borders of pale stripes darker than inner borders,\r\nusually blackish; pale stripes on snout occasionally absent (CNHM\r\n7845, UMMZ 92665, TU 5989, none of these specimens being large\r\nfemales); pale postocular stripe having narrow, dusky or blackish\r\nborders (especially UMMZ 92751, TU 14436); pale postocular stripe\r\nusually complete, occasionally interrupted having prominent\r\ndark-bordered anterior segment just behind eye (TU 14416); lower\r\nborder of postocular stripe usually in contact with dusky postlabial\r\nline; no other markings on side of head; pattern on dorsal surface of\r\nsoft parts of body not contrasting, composed of closely approximated\r\nfine markings that are little darker than background, over-all\r\ncoloration pale grayish; occasionally, few larger and more contrasting\r\nmarkings on hind limbs (UMMZ 92751, TU 14436).\r\n\r\nUnderparts white, usually lacking markings; occasional dusky markings\r\non plastral area (UMMZ 110502), dark spots or flecks on undersurface\r\nof carapace (BCB 6043, UMMZ 92666), or markings on throat (UMMZ\r\n95032).\r\n\r\nSurface of carapace smooth in adult males; large females lacking\r\nprominences posteriorly in center of carapace or in nuchal region;\r\nanterior edge of carapace smooth in both sexes, but occasionally\r\nhaving regularly spaced furrows or wrinkles (Fig. 8g).\r\n\r\n_Variation._--Short dusky lines and streaks seem to be lacking from\r\nthe juvenal pattern on the carapace more often in southern populations\r\n(Gulf Coast drainage of Texas) than in northern populations\r\n(Mississippi River drainage). I have seen one female, KU 48229 (Pl.\r\n46, bottom, left), plastral length 14.5 centimeters that retained a\r\nwell-defined juvenal pattern, and lacked a mottled and blotched\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nColor notes from life of 11 turtles, KU 55296-306, (eight adult males,\r\nthree immature females) from the Kansas River at Lawrence, Douglas\r\nCounty, Kansas, are: Buff-yellow rim of carapace, sometimes having\r\npale orange tinge; dusky, dark brown markings on pale brown or tannish\r\ncarapace of males; dark and pale brown mottled and blotched pattern on\r\ncarapace of females (smallest specimens having plastral length, 11.0\r\ncm.), many having orangish or buffy hue; soft parts of body brownish\r\nto olive-green dorsally, many having small, blackish marks on hind\r\nlimbs; webbing of limbs yellowish; pale orange, some yellow, laterally\r\nat juncture of dark dorsum and pale ventrum (to a lesser extent on\r\nhind limbs); pale orange in some suffusing onto dorsal surface of soft\r\nparts of body; black-bordered postocular stripes in males having\r\norangish tinge (pattern somewhat obscured in females); whitish ventral\r\nsurface in some having pale orangish tinge here and there; many having\r\ndusky, grayish flecking on plastral area and anterior ventral surface\r\n(most intense on 55306 giving appearance of grayish suffusion).\r\n\r\nI have seen only three specimens from the Colorado River drainage in\r\nTexas. Two of these (UMMZ 92751, TU 14436) are characterized by much\r\nblack pigmentation. A contrasting pattern of relatively large black\r\nmarks occurs on the dorsal surface of the soft parts of the body,\r\nespecially on the hind limbs, and the pale postocular stripes have\r\nthick black borders. UMMZ 92751, having a plastral length of 5.5\r\ncentimeters, has a juvenal pattern of widely-spaced dark dots that\r\nlacks short lines. The other _muticus_ from the Colorado River (CM\r\n3055), a large female 19.0 centimeters in plastral length, has\r\nill-defined postocular stripes lacking dark borders, although a small\r\ndusky blotch occurs on the right side of the head.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. m. muticus_ differs from _T. m. calvatus_ in\r\nhaving pale stripes on the snout, a juvenal pattern of small dusky\r\nspots (usually lacking ocellate spots) and short lines, and a pale\r\npostocular stripe lacking thick, blackish borders (except in some\r\nturtles from the Colorado River system of Texas). One unique\r\ncharacteristic of _muticus_ is the short, dusky lines in the juvenal\r\npattern; these marks, however, are occasionally absent.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--_Trionyx muticus_ generally has been considered a distinct\r\nspecies since its description by Lesueur (1827:263-66, Pl. 7);\r\nWied-Neuwied (1865:53), at least, questioned the identity of\r\n_muticus_, believing it to be based on a secondary sexual difference\r\nof _T. spiniferus_. Lesueur did not designate a type in the\r\ndescription, and mentioned that he had seen only three specimens (_op.\r\ncit._:264). Stejneger (1944:17-18) discussed two mounted specimens\r\n(Nos. 787 and 788) in the Natural History Museum at Paris, and\r\nmentioned that No. 787 was designated \"... as the type on the printed\r\nlabel (although presumably not done by Lesueur).\" Dr. Jean Guibé (_in\r\nlitt._ September 24, 1959) informed me that Nos. 787 and 788 are\r\nnumbers without value and correspond, respectively, to catalog numbers\r\n8813 and 8814. In addition, the Museum possesses an alcoholic\r\nspecimen, No. 564, obtained by Lesueur from the Wabash River, that\r\nseems to have been acquired by the museum after the publication of the\r\noriginal description. No. 8813 is regarded as a lectotype.\r\n\r\nGray (1864:87) described the species _microcephalus_ and questionably\r\nincluded it in the genus _Potamochelys_ Fitzinger, 1843; the locality\r\nwas stated as \"Sarawak (Wallace).\" Gray especially noted the small\r\nelongate head and believed that the acquisition of adult specimens\r\nwould prove that it belonged to a new genus. Later, Gray (1869:221)\r\nproposed the generic name _Callinia_ as a new name for _Aspidonectes_\r\nas understood by Agassiz (1857:403). Gray referred _microcephala_ to\r\n_Callinia_ (_op. cit._:214, 222) and recognized also _Amyda mutica_\r\n(_op. cit._:212). Baur (1888:1121) remarked that \"_Callinia\r\nmicrocephala_ Gray, of the British Museum, with the locality Sarawak,\r\nis _Amyda mutica_ Les.\" The species _microcephalus_ has since been\r\nconsidered a synonym of _Trionyx muticus_. Schmidt (1953:110)\r\ndesignated the type locality as New Harmony, Indiana.\r\n\r\nMüller (1878:641) listed the species _Trionyx muticus_ from México as\r\nfollows: \"*b. in Alcohol. Mexico. 1872. [2].\" Smith and Taylor\r\n(1950:18, footnote) wrote that the record required confirmation. Webb\r\nand Legler (1960:24) questionably referred this record to the synonomy\r\nof _T. ater_, which resembles _muticus_. _T. muticus_ is not known to\r\noccur in México. According to Dr. Lothar Forcart (_in litt._) of the\r\nNaturhistorische Museum in Basel, Switzerland, only one specimen on\r\nwhich Müller based his record is extant. My examination of this\r\nspecimen reveals that it is a hatchling _T. s. emoryi_, plastral\r\nlength 3.5 centimeters, bearing catalog number 1032; there are no\r\nadditional data of collection.\r\n\r\nStrecker and Williams (1927:16) mentioned one specimen of _muticus_\r\nthat was obtained at Christoval, Tom Green County, Texas, and I\r\npresume this is the basis for Pope's mention of this species from Tom\r\nGreen County, Texas (1949:319). Although I do not doubt that _T.\r\nmuticus_ occurs in Tom Green County, this record possibly is based on\r\n_T. spinifer_ because, 1) there are no specimens of _muticus_ in the\r\nStrecker Museum from Tom Green County, but there is one specimen of\r\n_spinifer_ (SM 3282), and in none of Strecker's publications is there\r\nany mention of _spinifer_ from Tom Green County, and 2) Strecker had,\r\nat least once, misidentified the two species; his record of _muticus_\r\nfrom Wallace Bayou, Louisiana (Strecker and Frierson, 1926:last page,\r\nno numbers), represents _T. spinifer pallidus_ (SM 2374-75).\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total 261, as follows: ALABAMA: _County\r\nunknown_: USNM 118167, Wheeler Reservoir, Tennessee River.\r\n\r\nARKANSAS: _Franklin_: KU 19459-60, Ozark. _Lafayette_: KU 2938, 3057,\r\nLewisville. _Lawrence_: CNHM 92003, Imboden; CNHM 92005, Powhatan;\r\nUSNM 59214, Black River, Black Rock. _Marion_: TU 14606 (2), White\r\nRiver at Cotter. _Prairie_: KU 1831, 1868, 1870, 1874-76, 1930-31,\r\n1957-63, 2294-302, 2305-06, 2308-09, 2838-41, 3002, White River,\r\nDeVall's Bluff.\r\n\r\nKANSAS: _Barber_: USNM 95185-86, 1 mi.

The eastern extent of geographic range is not known\r\n(see map, Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Juvenal pattern of large circular spots, often ocellate;\r\nno stripes on dorsal surface of snout; pattern on dorsal surface of\r\nlimbs of fine markings, not in contrast with ground color; pale\r\npostocular stripes having thick black borders approximately one half\r\nwidth of pale stripe on adult males.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Plastral length of smallest hatchling, 3.0 centimeters\r\n(TU 17301); of largest male, 11.8 centimeters (KU 47118); of largest\r\nfemale, 18.0 centimeters (TU 13473).\r\n\r\nJuvenal pattern of dusky, circular spots, some ocellate, lacking short\r\nlines and streaks; number of spots variable; some spots on carapace of\r\nhatchlings may have maximum diameter of three millimeters (TU 17301);\r\npale rim of carapace having dusky, ragged, inner border; juvenal\r\npattern on adult males absent or usually evident, at least posteriorly\r\n(TU 17306.1).\r\n\r\nDorsal surface of snout lacking pale stripes just in front of eyes;\r\npale postocular stripe having thick, black borders on adult males, but\r\nnarrower, dusky or blackish borders on juveniles and large females;\r\nlower border of postocular stripe usually in contact with dusky\r\npostlabial line; no other markings on side of head; pattern on dorsal\r\nsurface of soft parts of body of closely approximated, fine markings\r\nthat are not in contrast with ground color, over-all coloration\r\ngrayish; occasionally few larger and more contrasting markings,\r\nespecially on hind limbs and anteriolateral surface of forelimbs.\r\n\r\nUnderparts whitish, lacking markings, occasional black flecks or dusky\r\nmarks posteriorly along ventral edge of carapace (TU 17306.3).\r\n\r\nSurface of carapace smooth in adult males; large females lacking\r\nprominences posteriorly in center of carapace or in nuchal region;\r\nanterior edge of carapace smooth in both sexes, but occasionally\r\nhaving regularly spaced furrows or wrinkles on hatchlings.\r\n\r\n_Comparisons._--_T. m. calvatus_ can be distinguished from _T. m.\r\nmuticus_ by the absence of pale stripes on the snout just in front of\r\nthe eyes, in having pale postocular stripes that have thick, black\r\nborders on adult males, and in having a juvenal pattern of large,\r\ncircular spots that are often ocellate and three millimeters in\r\ndiameter (no short lines).\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--I have not seen specimens of _calvatus_ from the\r\nTombigbee-Alabama river drainage; presumably Cook's record (1946:185)\r\nfrom Lowndes County, Mississippi, represents this subspecies.\r\n\r\nIt is still not certain that _calvatus_ occurs in streams that drain\r\ninto Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana; TU 17236 from the Amite River that\r\nlacks a diagnostic character is questionably referred to _calvatus_\r\n(Webb, 1959:524). As mentioned previously _T. s. asper_ shows little\r\nevidence of intergradation with _T. spinifer_ in the Mississippi River\r\ndrainage; _asper_ is present in streams of the Lake Pontchartrain\r\ndrainage. _T. m. calvatus_ presumably shows a corresponding\r\nrelationship with _T. m. muticus_ in the Mississippi River drainage.\r\nThere are no specimens that indicate intergradation between _calvatus_\r\nand _muticus_; _calvatus_ is expected in streams that drain into Lake\r\nPontchartrain, Louisiana. Probably _calvatus_ occurs eastward in the\r\nApalachicola drainage system.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Total, 38 as follows: FLORIDA: _Escambia_: KU\r\n47116, 50852, 50854-55, 50835-36, TU 13473, 16682, 17301, 17302 (2),\r\nEscambia River, 2 mi.

The impermanence of water\r\nin the ponds and \"charcos\" of headwaters of streams may preclude the\r\npresence of softshells from these otherwise suitable habitats.\r\nSeemingly, soft-shelled turtles are not restricted to particular local\r\nsituations or microhabitats in a continuous aquatic environment as are\r\nsome kinds of fish, which seem to be more or less confined to riffle\r\nareas or deep holes. Certain activities of softshells such as burying\r\nthemselves in soft sand in shallow water or seeking crawfish and other\r\nfood over a gravel-rock substrate or one that is débris-laden, are best\r\ncarried on in different habitats. Repeated observations of turtles that\r\nare probably engaged in a specific activity in a restricted area may\r\nlead to erroneous general conclusions regarding the over-all preference\r\nfor a specific habitat. Perhaps this accounts for Conant's statement\r\n(1951:156) that \"In the lower portion of the Scioto River [Ohio] it\r\nappears that the present species [_muticus_] is abundant while\r\n_spinifer_ is almost entirely absent.\"\r\n\r\nCagle (1954:181) wrote that softshells \"inhabit the extreme headwaters\r\nand smaller tributaries.\" Other statements in the literature indicate\r\nthe variety in kinds of habitat. In Louisiana, Beyer (1900:44)\r\nmentioned _spinifer_ as abundant \"in all inland waters, preferring,\r\nhowever, such bayous which have sloping and sandy banks upon which\r\nthey are fond of sunning themselves.\" Viosca (1923:41) reported\r\nsoft-shelled turtles as characteristic \"of the large silt-bearing\r\nrivers ... such as the Pearl, Amite, Mississippi and Atchafalaya.\"\r\nCagle and Chaney (1950:386) wrote that _spinifer_ in Louisiana was\r\nfound in greatest abundance in streams having some current, but that\r\nindividuals were also common in quiet areas; the habitats recorded\r\nwere: False River--a lake of clear water supporting an abundance of\r\nsubmerged vegetation, the shallow ends having mats of water hyacinth;\r\nLakes Iatt and Bistineau--cypress swamps having clear or muddy water;\r\nCaddo Lake--a large lake having a light oil film on the surface of the\r\nwater, and vegetation toward the shore consisting of cattails, water\r\nlilies and water hyacinths, and along the bank of cypress and willow\r\ntrees; Caddo Lake Spillway--muddy with swift current; Sabine\r\nRiver--swift current, traps set in quieter backwater areas or near\r\ncypress logs in river; Lacassine Refuge--traps set in inlets and coves\r\nof ship channel having vegetation of water hyacinth, alligator grass,\r\nand along bank, saw grass, cypress knees and snags. Stejneger\r\n(1944:59) reported _spinifer_ taken in barrow pits in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Illinois, Cagle (1942:160) recorded _spinifer_ in drainage\r\nditches (normally having several feet of water and a lush growth of\r\naquatic vegetation) that connect inland swamps to the Mississippi\r\nflood-plain but dry up periodically, and in Elkville Lake, an\r\nartificial lake having much aquatic vegetation in shallow areas (_op.\r\ncit._:157). Myers (1927:339) recorded a _spinifer_ from Indiana from a\r\n\"tiny brook.\" In east-central Illinois P. W. Smith (1947:39) recorded\r\n_spinifer_ in mud-bottomed dredge ditches, lakes, ponds, small streams\r\nand rivers, whereas _muticus_ was found to prefer rivers having clean,\r\nsandy bottoms and was not taken from lakes or small streams. This\r\nrestriction in habitat preference of _muticus_ is again emphasized by\r\nSmith and Minton (1957:346) who wrote that in Illinois and Indiana,\r\n_muticus_ \"generally avoids lakes and minor streams.\" Weed (1923:48),\r\nhowever, recorded _muticus_ (and _spinifer_) from Meredosia Bay,\r\nIllinois, presumably a broad, shallow, muddy ox-bow lake of the\r\nIllinois River.\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, _spinifer_ has been taken from the Mississippi River,\r\nwhich is described as fairly swift having a fluctuating water level,\r\nsandy islands, mud banks, a bed of pebbles and large boulders, and\r\nabundant crawfish (Breckenridge, 1955:5). In Michigan, Edgren\r\n(1942:180) recorded _spinifer_ from a \"very small muck-bottomed lake.\"\r\nEvans and Roecker (1951:69) recorded _spinifer_ from Long Point, Lake\r\nOntario, which is a \"broad sand spit, straight on the lakeward side\r\nbut irregular with wet flats and lagoons on the bayside.\"\r\n\r\nIn Kansas, Brumwell (1951:207-08) found \"mostly young [_muticus_] ...\r\nin the old ponds left during flood stages of the Missouri River\" ...\r\nand _spinifer_ occasionally ... \"in the backwaters where stagnant\r\nponds had been formed.\" In southcentral Kansas, Burt (1935:321)\r\nreported _muticus_ from \"a sandbar at junction of a small creek and\r\nMedicine River\" ... and ... a \"shallow sand-bottomed, algae-filled\r\npasture streamlet.\" The same author reported _spinifer_ from a\r\n\"sand-bottomed prairie streamlet\" ... and ... \"an alga-filled pool\r\nnear a stream.\" Burt (_loc. cit._) remarked that \"No ecological\r\ndifferences in general habitat and field behavior of _mutica_ and\r\n_spinifer_ are evident in Kansas.\" Clarke (1958:21) observed\r\n_spinifer_ in Long Creek (Osage County, Kansas), which is a winding\r\nstream, characterized by numerous deep holes alternating with rocky\r\nriffles, and having high and wooded banks, and mostly mud bottom but\r\noccasional rock bottom.\r\n\r\nMarr (1944:490) mentioned a _spinifer_ that was obtained on the bank\r\nof a small, mud-bottomed stream in the Texas panhandle, and Linsdale\r\nand Gressitt (1937:222) recorded _spinifer_ from irrigation canals in\r\nBaja California.\r\n\r\nIn southern Florida, _ferox_ occurs in all fresh-water habitats\r\n(Duellman and Schwartz, 1958:272). Carr (1940:107) reported _ferox_ as\r\nwidely distributed in streams, lakes, big springs and canals. Judging\r\nfrom the numbers of turtles, \"the larger canals in the Everglades must\r\nrepresent something like an optimum habitat\" (Carr, 1952:417). Wright\r\nand Funkhouser (1915:119) wrote that in the Okefinokee Swamp, _ferox_\r\nwas especially abundant where the water is deep and the bottom soft,\r\nand the species was found wherever there were alligators. Deckert\r\n(1918:31) wrote that young _ferox_ were taken in springs and brooks\r\nnear Jacksonville, Florida. Marchand (_in_ Carr, 1952:417-19) observed\r\n_ferox_ while water-goggling in Florida and noted that individuals\r\nburied themselves in deep water in white sand, mud or bubbling\r\nmud-sand springs, sometimes where there was vegetation overhead.\r\nNeill (1951:16) collected _ferox_ in marshes, \"prairies,\" flood-plain\r\nlakes, lagoons, ox-bow lakes, mangrove swamps, rivers, creeks,\r\ncalcareous spring runs, man-made lakes and lime sinks. The same author\r\n(_loc. cit._) reported taking _agassizi_ (= _asper_) in large muddy\r\nrivers, clear \"blackwater\" streams, calcareous spring runs, creeks,\r\nmarshes, lagoons, ox-bow lakes, flood-plain lakes, lime sinks,\r\nman-made lakes, and smaller ponds. Crenshaw and Hopkins (1955:16),\r\nhowever, stated that in the area where _T. ferox_ and _T. spinifer\r\nasper_ overlap, \"_asper_ is nearly always an inhabitant of fluviatile\r\nsituations whereas _ferox_ is equally closely confined to\r\nnon-fluviatile lakes and ponds\"; in the region of sympatry, Schwartz\r\n(1956:8) reported _ferox_ from \"a moderately fast, blackwater stream\r\n[Combahee River, South Carolina].\"\r\n\r\nCarr (1952:417) wrote that _ferox_ is not uncommon near the mouths of\r\nstreams in brackish waters, where the tide must occasionally take it\r\nto sea, and cited Conant, who told of an individual found at sea in\r\nBahaman waters; Carr (1940:25) listed _ferox_ as occasional in the\r\nmarine-littoral, mangrove swamps, as did Neill (1951:16). Neill\r\n(1958:26-27) mentioned his observance of _ferox_ at the mouth of the\r\nPithlachascotee River, Pasco County, Florida, where the water is\r\nsufficiently saline to favor the growth of oysters, and added that\r\ncommercial fishermen had told him that these turtles are sometimes\r\nnetted with loggerhead sea turtles (_Caretta_) in the Indian River.\r\nNeill (_op. cit._:5-6) also noted the presence of _ferox_ on Meritt\r\nIsland, which supports an extensive saltwater herpetofauna, off the\r\ncoast of Brevard County, Florida. Löding (1922:47) recorded _spinifer_\r\nfrom Fig Island, Mobile County, Alabama, which is probably a marine or\r\nbrackish water habitat. Cagle and Chaney (1950:386) obtained one\r\n_spinifer_ in a brackish marsh of the Sabine Wildlife Refuge,\r\nLouisiana; the poor trapping returns here (one _Trionyx_ and one\r\n_Pseudemys_ in 408 trap-hours) suggest that fresh-water species are\r\nnot abundant in brackish habitats. Neill (1958:26-27) has summarized\r\nthe occurrence of soft-shelled turtles in marine and brackish\r\nhabitats.\r\n\r\nMy own observations indicate a variety of habitat preferences; the\r\nterm \"relatively clear\" refers to waters in which visibility extends\r\nfour to six inches below the surface at night using a head-light.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of _spinifer_ have been taken in large, deep rivers having\r\na moderate to swift current, relatively clear water, mostly sand and\r\nclay bottoms, and emergent débris intermittent along the shoreline;\r\nthe banks may be steep and of mud having a sparse growth of herbs\r\n(Black Warrior River, south of Tuscaloosa, Alabama), or of low\r\nextensive, sandy bars and beaches (Escambia River, near Century,\r\nFlorida, Pl. 50, Fig. 1). A juvenile _spinifer_ was taken by hand\r\namong rocks in quiet water behind a rocky shoal in the large,\r\ndeep-channeled Ocmulgee River (near Hawkinsville, Georgia). Several\r\nindividuals of _spinifer_ were seen in the Flint River (near\r\nBainbridge, Georgia), which had a swift current in a wide, deep\r\nchannel, sandy or sand-silt banks, few brush piles along shore and\r\nmany oölitic, submergent snags on an otherwise sandy bottom; the water\r\nwas exceedingly clear and permitted water-goggling (this habitat has\r\nbeen obliterated by a dam on the Apalachicola River). A large female\r\n_spinifer_ was taken on a set line from the bottom of one of several\r\ndeep holes (approximately seven feet) that were connected by shallow\r\nareas or riffles (near headwaters of Escambia River--Escambia Creek,\r\nEscambia County, Alabama). Two large females of _spinifer_ (one\r\nescaped) were taken on a trotline set in a large, deep, isolated\r\nbarrow pit near the Escambia River (near Century, Florida); there was\r\nno aquatic vegetation, the water was slightly turbid, and the\r\nsubstrate was of a sand-silt or mud.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, _spinifer_ has been taken in large deep rivers having\r\nrelatively clear water, a moderate current, steep banks four to 15\r\nfeet high, and a substrate of mud with few rocks (one taken on\r\ntrotline, escaped; Black River, near Black Rock, Lawrence County). Two\r\n_spinifer_ were taken (trotline and hoop-net) from a smaller\r\n(approximately 50 feet wide) turbid river having a swift current,\r\ndébris along the shoreline, and mud-gravel banks (Petit Jean Creek,\r\nYell County). Several _spinifer_ and _muticus_ were taken from the\r\nWhite River (Marion County) having a sand-gravel or bed rock bottom\r\nand clear water; individuals were collected by hand in shallow water\r\n(approximately 3-1/2 feet deep) as they lay on the bottom in the main\r\nchannel where the current was moderate to swift or in a quiet-water\r\nside channel having submergent vegetation.\r\n\r\nLake Texoma, an impoundment on the Red River, having a fluctuating\r\nwater level with no permanent stand of aquatic vegetation, a mud-rock\r\nor sand-silt bottom, and turbid water (Pl. 49, Fig. 1) is a suitable\r\nhabitat for _spinifer_ and _muticus_. _T. spinifer_ is found in large\r\nrivers having relatively clear water, moderate currents, emergent logs\r\nand débris, and mud or sand banks (Little River, McCurtain County,\r\nOklahoma, Pl. 48, Fig. 1), or small, shallow, turbid creeks having\r\nsand-gravel channels of pools connected by riffle areas (Mayhew Creek,\r\nChoctaw County, Oklahoma).\r\n\r\nThree _spinifer_ were taken from the Llano River (near Llano, Texas)\r\nin a period of low water level in hoop-nets set in a large quiet-water\r\npond about four feet deep and having patches of rushes encroaching\r\ninto the water from the shore. The river bed of sand, gravel and large\r\nboulders consisted of narrower, swift-water channels, small pools and\r\nriffles, and large ponds.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of _T. s. emoryi_ have been taken in large ponds having\r\nlittle or no current, turbid, deep water, and clay or sand-gravel\r\nbanks (Río Purificación, Padilla, Tamaulipas). Two _emoryi_ were\r\ncollected from a large pond (Río Sabinas, near Sabinas, Coahuila),\r\nwhich was connected to an adjoining one by riffle areas and had little\r\nor no current, relatively clear, greenish water, clay or mud banks, a\r\nsand-gravel bottom, and was flanked by brush and large cypress trees.\r\nA few _emoryi_ were trapped in hoop-nets that were set in the Río\r\nMesquites, a stream in central Coahuila approximately 20 feet wide and\r\nsix feet deep, flanked by dense stands of _Phragmites_, and having a\r\nmoderate current, relatively clear, pea-green water and a mud-sand\r\nsubstrate with some gravel; the stream enlarged in some places to form\r\nquiet-water coves (Pl. 48, Fig. 2). One adult male _emoryi_ was taken\r\nfrom a crystal-clear, dendritic, pond (El Mojarral, near Cuatro\r\nCiénegas, Coahuila), having shallow areas averaging about two feet but\r\nseveral deep holes--in one of these at the west end of the pond the\r\nwater was being emitted under pressure from an underwater cavern and\r\n\"bubbling\" at the surface; the vegetation consisted of scattered\r\npatches of water-lilies and stonewort; the bottom was a soft mud-marl,\r\nand in some places was carpeted with shells of small gastropods. This\r\nhabitat corresponds to that of the type locality of _T. ater_ (Pl. 49,\r\nFig. 2); see description in Webb and Legler (1960:26). The water of\r\nthe ponds is warm; at 8 p. m. on July 31, 1959, the temperature of the\r\nwater at the type locality of _ater_ was 29° C., and the air was 27°\r\nC.\r\n\r\nAn immature female _spinifer_ was taken on a trotline in a swift,\r\nclear, cold-water habitat having mud banks and an abundance of brush\r\npiles (Little Tennessee River, Monroe County, Tennessee). _T.\r\nspinifer_ occurs also in large ox-bow lakes having relatively clear\r\nwater, extensive mats of submerged vegetation, a soft mud bottom, and\r\nseveral emergent stumps and fallen logs (Lake Concordia, Concordia\r\nParish, Louisiana); alligator grass and cypress trees encroached to\r\nthe shoreline.\r\n\r\nLocality data of some individuals of _spinifer_, _hartwegi_, _asper_,\r\n_pallidus_ and _emoryi_ that were examined indicated that turtles were\r\ncaptured in ponds, bayous, sloughs, lakes, impoundments, rivers and\r\ncreeks, indicating habitation of essentially all permanent waters.\r\n\r\nA juvenile of _hartwegi_ was seen by Mr. Wendell L. Minckley on a\r\ngravel bar jutting into a small, shallow creek having a mud-gravel\r\nbottom (Carnahan Creek, Pottawatomie County, Kansas); the impounding\r\nof the Big Blue River by the Turtle Creek Dam will obliterate this\r\nhabitat. Mr. J. Knox Jones, Jr. reported seeing a large softshell in a\r\nnarrow, shallow, clear sandy creek in Holt County, Nebraska.\r\n\r\n_T. s. emoryi_ occurs in large rivers having generally turbid waters,\r\na moderate to swift current and mud or sand bottoms such as the Río\r\nGrande; this habitat corresponds to that of large rivers in the\r\nwestern parts of the range of _T. s. pallidus_ (Red and Washita) and\r\n_T. s. hartwegi_ (Canadian and Cimarron). These last-named rivers, in\r\nperiods of low water level, often have shallow, clear, flowing water\r\nin parts of the river bed. _T. s. emoryi_ has also been taken from\r\nsmall creeks having bottoms of rocks and large boulders (Black River\r\nVillage, Eddy County, New Mexico; field notes of Sydney Anderson and\r\nKenneth Shain, June 12-14, 1958).\r\n\r\nI received a hatchling _T. s. guadalupensis_ that was obtained in a\r\nclear, shallow-water stream (Hondo Creek, Bandera County, Texas, on\r\nApril 12, 1958). The larger streams and rivers known to be inhabited\r\nby _guadalupensis_ are generally clear having greenish-tinted waters.\r\nThe geographic distribution of _guadalupensis_ indicates that that\r\nsubspecies occurs principally in those waters that drain the\r\nlimestone-mantled, Edward's Plateau off the Balcones Escarpment; the\r\nheadwaters are characterized by clear, calcareous streams having\r\noccasional travertine deposits. It is probably this type of habitat to\r\nwhich Agassiz's statement (1857:408) of \"clear, bold and rocky\r\nstreams\" refers.\r\n\r\nThere are a few specimens whose locality data indicate a tolerance of\r\nbrackish-water habitats. An adult male _spinifer_ was obtained at\r\nDelacroix Island, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, a locality said to\r\nhave exceedingly brackish waters (Dr. George H. Bick, St. Mary's\r\nCollege, Notre Dame, Indiana); this adult male (TU 16170) is unique in\r\nhaving a mottled and blotched pattern. Another adult male (_spinifer_,\r\nTU 16071) was obtained in shallow water in Lake Pontchartrain at the\r\nmouth of Tchefuncta Creek; the salinity at the time of capture was\r\nrecorded as 1.7 (datum from Dr. Royal D. Suttkus, Tulane University),\r\nindicating only slightly brackish water. Two _spinifer_ (USNM\r\n100409-10) and one _muticus_ (USNM 100406) were taken at Berwick Bay,\r\nnear Morgan City, St. Mary's Parish, Louisiana; the waters at this\r\nlocality are probably brackish. The tolerance of brackish waters\r\ndoubtless facilitates the dispersal of these turtles along coastal\r\nmarshes and swamps, and into adjacent drainage systems. The greater\r\nnumber of records in the literature pertaining to _ferox_ suggest that\r\nthis species may be more tolerant of brackish and marine waters than\r\nare _spinifer_ or _muticus_.\r\n\r\nIn summary, _T. ferox_ occurs in all fresh-water habitats, but chiefly\r\nin lentic habitats in the northern part of its range where it and _T. s.\r\nasper_ are sympatric. _T. ferox_ possibly is more tolerant of brackish\r\nand marine waters than are the subspecies of _spinifer_ and _muticus_.\r\n\r\nThe subspecies of _T. spinifer_ occur in all fresh-water habitats. In\r\nthe southern part of the geographic range, which overlaps that of _T.\r\nferox_, _T. s. asper_ occurs principally in running-water habitats. _T.\r\ns. pallidus_ and _T. s. asper_ are tolerant of brackish-water habitats.\r\n_T. s. guadalupensis_, known at present only from rivers and streams,\r\noccurs principally in river systems that drain the Edward's Plateau of\r\nsouthcentral Texas. _T. ater_ is confined to crystal-clear ponds in\r\ncentral Coahuila.\r\n\r\nThe subspecies _muticus_ occurs in large rivers and streams throughout\r\nits geographic range, but is known from lakes and impoundments\r\nprincipally in the southern part of its range (the northernmost record\r\nis from Reelfoot Lake, Obion County, Tennessee); there is only one\r\nrecord of _muticus_ from a small, shallow, headwater creek (Reno County,\r\nKansas), and only one from a lentic habitat (Meredosia Bay, Illinois) in\r\nthe northern part of its range. _T. muticus calvatus_ is known at\r\npresent only from rivers and streams.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly greater restriction of _muticus_ to running-water habitats\r\nsuggests less vagility than in _spinifer_ (Netting, 1944:86).\r\n\r\nSize and coloration are adaptations to habitat. Soft-shelled turtles of\r\nlarge size are best adapted to mesic, essentially continuous swampy or\r\nmarshy habitats, whereas small size is an adaptation to less continuous,\r\nsemi-isolated habitats. A turtle of the maximum size attained by _ferox_\r\nin the habitat of _emoryi_ would, in a general way, probably be more\r\nconspicuous and exposed to its enemies, both in the aquatic environment\r\nand during overland excursions; perhaps the kind and amount of food\r\nwould be insufficient. In any event, small size is correlated with the\r\nmore arid habitats of the southwest, and large size with mesic ones in\r\nthe southeast. _T. ferox_, the largest species, and the smallest\r\npopulation of _T. spinifer_ (resembling _muticus_) both occur in the\r\nsouthernmost part of the range of the genus. This situation does not\r\nsupport the corollary of Bergmann's Rule, that pertains to some groups\r\nof terrestrial reptiles, in which those subspecies occurring farther\r\nnorth, or in cooler climates during their season of activity, tend to be\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nWithin the species _spinifer_, the _emoryi_ group of subspecies are\r\npallid having whitish dots on the carapace and lack extensive black\r\npigmentation; these features seem to confer protective coloration on the\r\ninhabitants of arid, essentially sandy or muddy habitats having\r\nsluggish, turbid waters, whereas the more contrasting patterns of the\r\n_spinifer_ group of subspecies eastward seem more suited to existence in\r\nclearer, swifter waters.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the two clines, _spinifer-hartwegi_ and\r\n_pallidus-guadalupensis_, in the species _spinifer_ are notable in that\r\nthe former occurs mostly in one large continuous drainage system, that\r\nof the Mississippi, and shows no sharp break in the one character\r\ndistinguishing the two subspecies whereas populations composing the\r\n_pallidus-guadalupensis_ cline are separated into several river\r\ndrainages, and show a relatively sharp break in several characters at\r\nthe Brazos-Colorado river divide. This situation seemingly supports the\r\nthesis that clines are maintained by some sort of parallel gradient in\r\necological or geological conditions. It is notable that streams draining\r\nthe Edward's Plateau (inhabited by _guadalupensis_) differ in quantity\r\n(more) and quality (especially CO_{3}^{--}, Ca^{++}, and Mg^{++} ions)\r\nof their solutes, and probably pH (higher) from those farther east\r\n(Hubbs, 1957:102). The gross difference in habitats mentioned above\r\n(sandy, turbid, sluggish streams in the west _vs._ clear, swift streams\r\nin the east) may affect the differentiation recognizable in the\r\n_spinifer-hartwegi_ cline.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily and Seasonal Activity\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diurnal Habits_\r\n\r\nSoftshells bask on débris in the water or on banks close to the water;\r\nbasking presumably raises the bodily temperature. In general in the\r\nsoutheastern and southwestern United States, I have seen softshells\r\nbasking only rarely but once saw six at one time close together on logs\r\nin Bowie Creek, Hattiesburg, Mississippi (species undetermined). Surface\r\n(1908:122) saw _spinifer_ in rows on rocks or logs in tributaries of the\r\nOhio River. Duellman and Schwartz (1958:271-72) stated that _ferox_\r\nbasks on banks or beds of aquatic vegetation. Deckert (1918:31)\r\nmentioned large _ferox_ \"sunning in shallow water at edge of pond.\"\r\nMinton (1944:447) wrote that _muticus_ and _spinifer_ sun on steep mud\r\nbanks (Wabash River). Cahn (1937:180) stated that _muticus_ (in\r\nIllinois) basks on banks at the water's edge but seldom on logs, and\r\nsuggests that _muticus_ is less prone to leave the water than\r\n_spinifer_. According to Carr (1952:438), _muticus_ never basks on\r\nlogs or rocks. In Ohio, Conant (1951:159) mentioned _spinifer_ as\r\noccasionally basking upon a log or rock, or sometimes on steep clay\r\nbanks of streams. On banks, quick escape is facilitated by directing the\r\nhead toward the water, thus eliminating the time that it would take to\r\nturn around on land (Conant, _loc. cit._; Newman, 1906:129). Evermann\r\nand Clark (1920:593) mentioned _spinifer_ as basking on sandy or grassy\r\nshores, and large boulders. Muller (1921:181) wrote that _muticus_ basks\r\nfour to ten feet from the water's edge on gently sloping sand and mud\r\nshores of small islands in the Mississippi River (near Fairport, Iowa).\r\nMuller stated that basking usually occurs in the morning, up until 2 p.\r\nm., and that beaches with a northern exposure were preferred; he\r\nobserved 37 turtles within a 50-foot stretch of beach. In captivity,\r\nhatchlings bask on wire-mesh supports.\r\n\r\nI have frequently observed softshells floating at the surface of the\r\nwater, a habit previously mentioned by Surface (1908:122) and Pope\r\n(1949:305, 311). Individuals of _Pseudemys_ and, to a lesser extent,\r\n_Graptemys_ also float at the surface; those kinds of turtles and\r\nsoftshells at least, often appear at the surface of the water, seemingly\r\nas a result of an inquisitiveness, following repeated disturbances that\r\ncause submergence.\r\n\r\nNewman (1906:131) described the active pursuit of food: \"They crawl or\r\nswim along the bottom, thrusting their snouts under stones and into\r\nmasses of aquatic vegetation, occasionally snapping up a crayfish or\r\nlarva that they have succeeded in dislodging. They do not tear up their\r\nfood, but swallow it whole, using the forefeet to assist in forcing it\r\ndown.\" Surface (1908:123) suggested that softshells may feed \"upon\r\ninsects which may be found floating on the water,\" and I have had\r\ncaptives take insects from the surface of the water. Carr (1940:107)\r\nalso wrote that _ferox_ and numerous gars in the Tamiami Canal, often at\r\nthe mouths of the tributary ditches, snap at each other furiously as\r\nfloating bits of food are washed in from the Everglades. Another habit\r\nthat has been mentioned as an aid in acquiring food (Breckenridge,\r\n1944:186; Conant, 1951:156; Hudson, 1942:101) is burrowing just below\r\nthe surface in a soft bottom in shallow water, to ambush passing fish,\r\nor other food. Presumably all kinds of softshells do this in both\r\nshallow and deep water of lakes or rivers having a suitable substrate;\r\n_spinifer_ and _muticus_ have been reported to burrow in shallow waters\r\n(no observations in deep water) by Agassiz (1857:333), Cahn (1937:180,\r\n189), Conant (1951:159) and Weed (1923:48). Marchand (_in_ Carr,\r\n1952:417-19) noted that _ferox_ burrows in deep water, and mentioned\r\nthat in areas of bare white sand a group of fish invariably surrounds\r\nthem, and one can locate buried softshells by observing these particular\r\nschools of fish. No mention was made of the turtles attempting to catch\r\nthe fish. Other associations of soft-shelled turtles and fish have been\r\ndescribed. Kirtland (_in_ DeKay, 1842:7) observed several large bass\r\nthat closely followed large numbers of turtles floating at the surface.\r\nNewman (1906:131) reported the observations of fishermen in Lake\r\nMaxinkuckee that large-mouth black bass stay not far away from swimming\r\nsoftshells; the same author also mentioned the observations of Jacob\r\nReighard, who suggested that bass may be feeding upon minnows that he\r\nnoticed following softshells. Seemingly some sort of commensalistic\r\nrelationship exists whereby fish acquire food that is dislodged by\r\ngrubbing and scurrying of softshells. Probably food is pursued on\r\noccasion from a buried position, but this habit probably is not executed\r\nspecifically for obtaining food. Newman (_op. cit._:129) was of the\r\nopinion that burrowing in shallow water is a habit to facilitate\r\n\"warming up.\"\r\n\r\nMarchand (_loc. cit._) also wrote of other notable underwater\r\nobservations on _ferox_ in Florida. He commented on this turtle's\r\ninquisitiveness in deep water and unconcern upon being touched or even\r\nupon being handled to some degree. Calf-deep in soft mud, he noted a\r\nturtle that \"emerged from the mud of the bottom, headed up toward shore,\r\ncircled, and when about three feet above the bottom dived suddenly and\r\ncompletely disappeared.\" Marchand wrote that some areas on the bottom\r\n(Crystal Springs), which are rooted up by the burrowing of softshells,\r\nare bare and soft, and assume a characteristic, easily recognized,\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nCahn (1937:180, 189) stated that the burrowing process consists of\r\n\"flipping\" the loose sand or silt over the back, whereas Conant\r\n(1951:159) described the process as a rapid lateral movement of the\r\nbody. My observations of captives agree essentially with Conant's\r\nobservations. The initial movement, directed at a slight angle, is\r\nprincipally with the forelegs although complemented by lateral movements\r\nof the body. When the turtle is approximately half buried, it makes\r\nrapid lateral movements of the body, which completely bury the turtle\r\nand orient its body in a horizontal position.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Behavior and Adaptations_\r\n\r\nSome characteristics of softshells that are often mentioned in the\r\nliterature are: extreme shyness or wariness, ferociousness as captives,\r\ndazzling speed and agility on land and in water, and great dependence on\r\naquatic environment. Certainly they are wary; and this wariness may\r\naccount, in part, for the scarcity of observations of basking, and\r\nstatements attesting to their great speed on land. To my mind, their\r\nreported ferociousness and savage disposition as captives is overrated;\r\nof the many softshells that I have collected, only a few attempted to\r\nbite. The extensibility of their long neck does warrant more careful\r\nhandling than needs to be employed with other species. Holbrook (_in_\r\nHay, 1892:145) even wrote that they \"will sometime leap up and give a\r\nloud hiss,\" and Newman (1906:130) wrote that \"they hiss violently and\r\nthrust out the head.\" Wright and Funkhouser (1915:120) reported a\r\ncaptive _ferox_ that \"could jump forward practically its own length.\" I\r\nhave been bitten by individuals of _Kinosternon_, _Sternothaerus_,\r\n_Pseudemys_ and _Graptemys_, and cannot support the contention that\r\nsoftshells are more prone to bite than those species, a view shared by\r\nLeConte (_in_ DeKay, 1842:7); many softshells on initial capture will\r\ntend to withdraw the head completely for a short time. Newman (_loc.\r\ncit._) also wrote that recently captured specimens exude a thick,\r\nyellow, semi-fluid resembling yolk of an egg from the inguinal glands;\r\nthe substance, however, is odorless but \"undoubtedly homologous with the\r\nemission of the inguinal glands of the musk and snapping tortoises.\"\r\nPerhaps there is a difference in aggressiveness associated with\r\ngeographic location, the age of the turtle or individual temperament.\r\n\r\nSmith (1956:159), referring to _muticus_, wrote that they are the best\r\nswimmers of all fresh-water turtles, and perhaps of any turtles.\r\nCorresponding statements of other authors attesting to their speed and\r\nagility (including _spinifer_ and _ferox_) in water and on land are\r\nbased principally on the published comments of Muller (1921:181), who\r\nobserved that females disturbed while laying eggs \"about fifty feet from\r\nwater ... covered the distance faster than a man can run.\" Cahn\r\n(1937:180) also stated that _muticus_ on a \"level, unobstructed sand\r\nbeach ... can outrun a man,\" and (_op. cit._:181) can \"capture fish with\r\nease\"; Cahn supported the latter statement by relating his observation\r\nof a _muticus_ that captured a small brook trout in a large tank. Smith\r\n(_op. cit._:162) wrote that _spinifer_ is \"said to overtake bass.\"\r\nDoubtless they are good swimmers and they do scurry rapidly on land.\r\n\r\nPublished statements relating to the strictly aquatic existence of\r\nsoftshells especially _muticus_, are based on recognition of \"its\r\ndrastic adaptations to aquatic existence\" (Carr, 1952:428); these\r\nadaptations presumably include pharyngeal respiration and the marked\r\ndepression of body form. Pharyngeal respiration was demonstrated for\r\n_muticus_ and _spinifer_ (Gage, 1884; Gage and Gage, 1886), and was\r\nconsidered the principal type of aquatic respiration (some dermal and\r\nsome cloacal) in _Trionyx spinifer asper_ by Dunson (1960). Cloacal\r\nbursae (anal respiration) are lacking in trionychids (Smith and James,\r\n1955:88). Accessory pharyngeal respiration is meaningful in light of the\r\ninformation furnished by Agassiz (1857:282-83), who found that _Trionyx_\r\nhas a smaller lung capacity (weight of body in ounces/capacity of lungs\r\nin cubic inches = 16.9) than do some other genera (_Pseudemys_, 2.8;\r\n_Testudo_, 2.7; _Terrapene_, 1.1); corresponding values for more aquatic\r\nspecies were _Chelydra_, 9.3 and _Kinosternon_, 16.0. Cahn (1937:181),\r\nhowever, wrote that he has demonstrated pharyngeal respiration in\r\nindividuals of _Pseudemys_, _Chrysemys_ and _Sternothaerus_, and Allen\r\nand Neill (1950:13) suggested that it occurs in _Macroclemys_. More\r\nconclusive data are required to detect a positive correlation between\r\nsmall lung capacity, pharyngeal respiration, and degree of restriction\r\nto an aquatic habitat.\r\n\r\nThe depressed, soft-margined carapace of softshells has been mentioned\r\nas an adaptation to facilitate burrowing in soft sand or mud, and more\r\nsuited for concealment than for speed in aquatic locomotion (Carr,\r\n1952:429; Smith, 1956:162). Nielsen (1951:264-65), commented that in\r\nvarious lotic invertebrates, dorsoventral flattening of the body was no\r\ncommoner than in lentic invertebrates; he wrote that a dorsoventral\r\nflattening is a disadvantage to an animal in a strong current and is an\r\nadaptation \"probably ... not to withstand the current directly, but to\r\navoid it by seeking shelter in narrow crevices.\" Probably another aid to\r\nconcealment, mentioned by Williams and McDowell (1952:272), is the\r\nplastral hinge.\r\n\r\nConcealment of softshells is not enhanced by growths of algae on the\r\ncarapace. Proctor (1958:637-38) reported that the common, epizoöphytic\r\nalga of chelonians, _Basicladia_, has never been reported from\r\n_Trionyx_; the same author recorded a large amount of filamentous algae,\r\nprincipally _Stigeoclonium_, but the algae could be easily wiped from\r\nthe turtle, and Vinyard (1955:64) recorded an alga, _Dermatophyton\r\nradians_, attached to the skin of the legs of _Trionyx_. I noted a small\r\npatch of greenish scum growing near the insertion of the neck on a\r\nsoftshell (_spinifer_ from Lake Texoma); cursory examination by Dr. R.\r\nH. Thompson, disclosed one of the colonial ciliate protozoans\r\n(resembling _Opercularia_) with enmeshed green or blue-green algae.\r\nEvermann and Clark (1920:592) mention a _spinifer_ from Lake\r\nMaxinkuckee, Indiana, having a growth of _Opercularia_, covering the\r\nplastron.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Movement_\r\n\r\nThe reported proclivity of softshells for a strictly aquatic existence\r\nhas been over-emphasized; they are no more confined to aquatic habitats\r\nthan some chelydrids (including kinosternids). In fact, there is a\r\ngeneral parallel in habits between members of the two families, namely,\r\na tendency toward a bottom-dwelling existence, and a burrowing habit.\r\nThe alligator snapping turtle (_Macroclemys_) is probably the most\r\naquatic fresh-water turtle in the United States. The common snapping\r\nturtle and some kinosternids are known to migrate overland. Kinosternids\r\nand trionychids bask frequently, and trionychids have been observed\r\nmoving overland. Cox (1894:50) reported a _spinifer_ attempting to climb\r\na narrowly-stepped, 12-foot dam on Mud Creek at Ravenna, Nebraska; the\r\nturtle failed after repeated struggles, once reaching a height four\r\ninches shy of the brim before tumbling back into the water. Duellman and\r\nSchwartz (1958:271) commented that adults of _ferox_ are often seen on\r\nroads bordering canals, and informants have told me verbally of similar\r\nobservations. Conant (1930:61) reported an individual of _ferox_ that\r\nwas \"... walking across the main street in Venice [Sarasota County,\r\nFlorida].\" Softshells will travel overland in search for suitable\r\nnesting sites; Newman (1906:130) wrote that _spinifer_ will climb \"steep\r\nrailway embankments with considerable ease, in order to reach a sand pit\r\nsome fifty yards from the water.\"\r\n\r\nFrom an analysis of species-composition of large reservoirs and lakes\r\nand their adjacent smaller ponds in southern Illinois, Cagle (1942:162)\r\nconcluded that softshells \"travel overland far less often than do ...\"\r\nother species, but that they are \"probably the first to move as the\r\nwater level falls.\" On the basis of further observations in the same\r\nregion, Cagle (1944:15) wrote that softshells rarely move overland, and\r\nonce trapped in a pool of water, they bury themselves and remain there.\r\nHe related instances of several individuals having been dug from dried\r\nmud where the last remnants of a water pool had evaporated and he\r\nconcluded that the home range is probably confined to one body of water.\r\nThat fluctuations in water level affect the movement of softshells is\r\nsuggested by Mr. William E. Brode's comment that a commercial fisherman\r\ntrapped numerous softshells in the Pearl River, south of Monticello,\r\nMississippi, in unbaited hoop-nets in late May and June when the water\r\nlevel was receding after heavy rains.\r\n\r\nThe meager data available concerning the aquatic movements of softshells\r\nindicate that individuals wander but little. Breckenridge (1955:6,\r\ntable 1) found that among 30 recaptured turtles that had been marked,\r\nthe greatest distance traveled was 600 yards over a two-year interval;\r\nafter a three-month interval one originally captured 30 miles distant,\r\nmoved only 200 yards. The statement of a professional turtle trapper\r\nmentioned by Breckenridge (_loc. cit._) and data previously presented\r\n(see page 436), to the effect that over-trapping results in increasingly\r\ndiminished returns, tends to support the idea that there is little\r\naquatic movement in soft-shelled turtles.\r\n\r\nBreckenridge (_loc. cit._) mentioned methods of marking softshells and\r\nfound that notching the edge of the carapace with a leather punch was\r\nsatisfactory; the notches healed but were discernible as shallow\r\nsinuses. The same author mentioned a tattooing device (mentioned also by\r\nCagle, 1939:171), but no turtles so marked were ever recognized as\r\nrecovered. Tagging with a radioactive isotope and detection with\r\nsuitable instruments should prove applicable to turtles (see Karlstrom,\r\n1957).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nocturnal Habits_\r\n\r\nAnderson (1958:212) wrote that hatchlings (_muticus_) leave nests within\r\nthe first three hours after sunset, and are active on the surface of the\r\nsand at night. Muller (1921:183) reported hatchlings (_muticus_) leaving\r\nnests at night or early in the morning. Lagler (1954) stated that\r\n_spinifer_ is nocturnal. To my knowledge there are no other published\r\nstatements concerning nocturnal activity of soft-shelled turtles. I have\r\nnoted them at night on only four different occasions. In two instances\r\n(Clear Fork Brazos River, Texas, and Lake Concordia, Louisiana), the\r\nturtles were resting immediately below the surface of the water on\r\nsubmerged branches, as one would expect _Pseudemys_ and _Graptemys_ to\r\ndo. Another individual was seen swimming near the surface (Ocmulgee\r\nRiver, 1-1/2 mi. S Jacksonville, Georgia); this observation possibly\r\nrepresents nocturnal activity, or inquisitiveness owing to the\r\ndisturbances caused by the motor of the boat and/or our head lights. A\r\nfinal observation tends to support the view of nocturnal habits. My\r\nfield notes record at least four softshells collected by hand, and a few\r\nother seen in a shallow (approximately four feet deep), quiet, clear\r\nwater side channel of the White River (Cotter, Arkansas); the turtles\r\nwere seen resting and slowly moving on the bottom or swimming.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seasonal Occurrence_\r\n\r\nThe length of the season of activity increases with decrease in\r\nlatitude. Aquatic species in general have longer periods of activity\r\nthan terrestrial species at the same northern temperate latitudes. The\r\nsouthernmost populations of all species of softshells may be active\r\nthroughout the year, assuming temperature to be the limiting factor.\r\n\r\nThere are few published statements relative to the length of the annual\r\nperiod of activity; all records refer to _spinifer_. In Lake\r\nMaxinkuckee, northern Indiana, Newman (1906:128) wrote that individuals\r\nwere first seen in early April on the lake shore in a weak condition\r\nwith neck and legs extended, and were easily captured. Lesueur\r\n(1827:262) wrote that _spinifer_ in Indiana appears toward the end of\r\nApril. Observations of Evermann and Clark (1920:592) in Lake\r\nMaxinkuckee, and Butler (1894:224) in east central Indiana concurred in\r\nfinding that of all kinds of turtles there, softshells appeared last in\r\nspring and disappeared first in fall. Evermann and Clark found small\r\nsoftshells, benumbed or dead, along the shore as early as March 18 and\r\nalso late in fall. The earliest observation for large softshells was\r\nApril 29, and the latest was September 7; Butler found that these\r\nturtles rarely appear before April 15 and sometimes not until May 1.\r\nCahn (1937:191) stated that softshells in Illinois hibernate toward the\r\nend of October and emerge in May or the latter part of April; the same\r\nauthor mentioned that in southern Illinois the species might remain\r\nsluggishly active all winter. In Ohio, Conant (1951:160) wrote that\r\nindividuals were collected every month from March to October, and one\r\nwas even taken in December, 1929, in northwestern Ohio. Wright (1919:8)\r\nmentioned observing softshells on April 20 and September 20 (presumably\r\nthese were the earliest and latest observations of them) in Monroe and\r\nWayne counties, New York. Blatchley (1891:34) listed dates of early and\r\nlate activity as March 19 and December 11 for Vigo County, Indiana.\r\nWebster (1936:22) recorded the earliest and latest dates of collection\r\nof _spinifer_ in central Oklahoma as June 10 and November 8.\r\n\r\nMoore and Rigney (1942:80) found an individual of _muticus_ under six\r\ninches of ice in water about one foot deep on January 31, 1940 (Cimarron\r\nRiver, Payne County, Oklahoma).\r\n\r\nThe published information suggests that the length of the normal annual\r\nperiod of activity of _spinifer_ in latitudes of about 40° and 43° is\r\napproximately five months, from April into September, depending upon the\r\nweather. There are numerous published statements to the effect that the\r\nperiod of hibernation is passed under a shallow covering of mud in deep\r\nwater. Evermann and Clark (_op. cit._: 593) found a softshell\r\n(presumably in a quiescent state) on September 6 that was \"buried up to\r\nits eyes in mud at the edge of Lost Lake.\" Softshells possibly hibernate\r\nin shallow water or in soft mud flats. Conant (_loc. cit._) found that\r\ncaptives would not hibernate in a pond in a zoo having a bottom of\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood Habits\r\n\r\nPrevious authors, most of whom allude to published statements preceding\r\ntheir own, characterize soft-shelled turtles as carnivorous and mention\r\nsuch food items as crawfish, insects, worms, snails, clams, frogs,\r\ntadpoles, fish, and occasional vegetable matter. Stockwell (1878:403)\r\nwrote that the relative lengths of portions of the digestive tract\r\nindicate \"a purely carnivorous diet.\"\r\n\r\nIn an examination of the contents of 11 stomachs of _spinifer_ from\r\nMichigan, Lagler (1943:304) found that crawfish (47%) and insects\r\n(52%), principally burrowing mayfly naiads (_Hexagenia_), and\r\ndragonfly naiads, comprised the bulk of the diet with cryptogams,\r\nvegetable débris, snails and fish remains present in small amounts.\r\nBreckenridge (1944:186) wrote that 18 specimens of _spinifer_ in\r\nMinnesota contained 44 per cent crawfish, 29 per cent aquatic insects,\r\n8 per cent fish, and 19 per cent unidentified material. Surface\r\n(1908:123) found crawfish in the only two stomachs of specimens he\r\nexamined from Pennsylvania. Penn (1950) summarized the results of\r\nthose authors, and estimated that crawfishes comprised 58 per cent\r\n(46% by volume) of the diet of softshells. In Indiana, three stomachs\r\nexamined by Newman (1906:131) in late June contained: 1) nine\r\ncrawfish, 2) four crawfish, 22 dragonfly naiads, 3) nine dragonfly\r\nnaiads, few plant buds. Neill (1951a:765) found crawfishes in the\r\nstomachs of five _spinifer_ from the Savannah River, Georgia. Evermann\r\nand Clark (1920:595) wrote that _spinifer_ in Lake Maxinkuckee feeds\r\nprincipally on crawfishes. Shockley (1949:257) mentioned bottom\r\norganisms and small fishes as food. Clark and Southall (1920:16)\r\nstated that \"Its principal food, to judge from a few specimens\r\nexamined, consists of crayfishes.\"\r\n\r\nCahn (1937:183) wrote that the food of _muticus_ in Illinois consists\r\nprincipally of crawfish, fish, frogs, tadpoles, larger insect larvae\r\nand nymphs, and aquatic mollusks. The kinds of fish eaten were\r\n_Notropis heterolepis_, _N. spilopterus_, _N. hudsonius_, _Lepomis\r\nmachrochirus_, _Morone chrysops_, _Perca flavescens_, _Catostomus\r\ncommersonnii_, and _Hypentelium nigricans_; Cahn (_loc. cit._) also\r\nstated that the mollusks eaten by _muticus_ are both gastropods and\r\nsmall, thin-shelled bivalves. In regard to the feeding habits of\r\n_spinifer_ in Illinois, Cahn (_op. cit._:193) listed the following\r\nitems in decreasing order of abundance as revealed by examinations of\r\nstomachs: crawfish, minnows, fry of larger fish, frogs, tadpoles,\r\nearthworms, insects (often beetles), and mollusca (_Pisidium_,\r\n_Viviparus_, planorbids). The kinds of fish mentioned were: _Notropis\r\nheterodon_, _N. heterolepis_, _N. hudsonius_, _Catostomus\r\ncommersonnii_, _Lepomis humilis_, _L. macrochirus_, _Semotilus\r\natromaculatus_, _Notemigonus crysoleucas_, _Umbra limi_, and\r\n_Micropterus salmoides_. Cahn (_loc. cit._) also found the remains of\r\na six-inch brook trout (_Salvelinus_) in the stomach of a 13-inch\r\n_spinifer_ from Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nAgassiz (1857:399) found larvae of neuropterous insects in the stomach\r\nof one specimen of _muticus_, and fragments of _Anodonta_ and\r\n_Paludina_ (= _Campeloma_) in the stomach of one _ferox_. The expanded\r\ncrushing surfaces of the jaws in some large individuals of _ferox_ may\r\nbe an adaptation to mollusc-feeding (Schmidt and Inger, 1957:36).\r\nSurface (1908:123) found _spinifer_ to have fragments of beetles in\r\none of two specimens examined, and large quantities of corn in another\r\nfrom Ohio. Webb and Legler (1960:27) reported 23 chrysomelid beetle\r\nlarvae (_Donacia_) in one specimen of _T. ater_. Evermann and Clark\r\n(1920:595) reported several _spinifer_ taken on hooks baited with\r\ngrasshoppers in water 14 feet deep in Lake Maxinkuckee, Indiana. Hay\r\n(1892:144) wrote of _muticus_ that \"If there are potatoes growing near\r\nthe water the turtles find their way to them and devour the stems, of\r\nwhich they are very fond.\" Wright and Funkhouser (1915:123) stated\r\nthat young _ferox_ in the Okefinokee Swamp feed on fish and frogs, and\r\naccording to the natives, larger specimens take waterfowl, a statement\r\nthat Smith (1956:159) was probably reiterating when he mentioned that\r\nthe diet included \"perhaps young birds.\" Parker (1939:88) wrote that\r\nof two _spinifer_ from Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee, one contained\r\ncoleopteran remains, and the other an aquatic beetle and two large\r\ntipulid larvae. Wied-Neuwied (1865:54) wrote that Lesueur found worms,\r\nsnails, remains of _Paludina_ (= _Campeloma_), fruits and even hard\r\nnuts in stomachs of _muticus_.\r\n\r\nHolbrook (_in_ Hay, 1892:145) mentioned that _spinifer_ feeds on fish\r\nand such reptiles as it can secure. There are no published statements\r\nknown to me that report reptiles in the diet of American softshells.\r\nCarr (1952:425) erroneously cited Strecker (1927:9) and attributed \"a\r\nyoung lined snake\" to the diet of _T. s. emoryi_; Strecker, however,\r\nreferred to _Kinosternon flavescens_. In conjunction with raising\r\nsoftshells on turtle farms, Mitsukuri (1905:261) mentioned that first\r\nand second year-old turtles (_Trionyx sinensis_) must be transferred\r\nto separate ponds or they will be eaten by adults; perhaps\r\ncorresponding cannibalistic tendencies exist in confined, natural\r\nhabitats in American softshells.\r\n\r\nCaptives eat essentially the same things that free-living individuals\r\ndo, plus scraps of meat (Strecker, 1927:9; Gloyd, 1928:135; Pope,\r\n1949; Conant, 1951:156, 160). Lagler (1943:303) mentioned a young\r\n_spinifer_ that fed on water fleas (_Daphnia_) and canned fish. Conant\r\n(_op. cit._:160) wrote that no captive was observed to take vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nFood, mostly in intestines, of two adult females of _T. s. emoryi_\r\ncollected on June 12-14, 1959, from the Río Grande at Lajitas,\r\nBrewster County, Texas, was examined. One female, KU 51961, contained\r\nlittle food and mostly plant fragments; because the stomach or\r\nintestine was not full of plant fragments, this food probably was\r\ningested incidentally to the few insects present. Another female, KU\r\n51955, contained insects, which were identified by Dr. George W.\r\nByers, Department of Entomology, University of Kansas, as follows: 1)\r\nColeoptera, Dryopidae, genus _Helichus_, most numerous, 350 to 400\r\nindividuals; 2) Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, genus _Phyllophaga_, one\r\nindividual; 3) Odonata, Coenagrionidae, fragments, probably one\r\nindividual; 4) Hymenoptera, Sphecidae, subfamily Bembicinae, one\r\nindividual; 5) Ephemeroptera; fragments of naiad; and 6) a few plant\r\nseeds, pieces of slender roots, weed stems and a couple of fragments\r\nof tree bark. The scarab and wasp probably fell into the water and\r\nwere eaten.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 6.

The turtles (KU 55296-306, eight adult males and three\r\nimmature females, ranging in plastral length from 9.0 to 12.5 cm.)\r\nwere collected in June, 1958, by Mr. Robert R. Patterson. All turtles\r\nwere caught on hook and line in a period of about four or five hours\r\nat dusk. Patterson frequently fished below the bridge at Lawrence and\r\nobserved that heads of softshells were often seen there about dusk and\r\nthat the turtles seemed to prefer a rather shallow, quiet-water area\r\nof swirls and eddies for feeding. The stomachs, and to a lesser\r\ndegree, the intestines, were nearly full. Some turtles contained plant\r\nfragments, principally elm seeds. The kinds of food in this sample\r\nwere also identified by Dr. Byers and were mostly insects, the most\r\nfrequent item being trichopterans; many of the insects eaten\r\nundoubtedly fell into the water. The remains of spiders were found in\r\nfour stomachs and crawfish fragments in five.\r\n\r\nStomachs of two adults of _muticus_ from Lake Texoma, Oklahoma, were\r\nopened. The stomach of one (OU 27593) was full of naiads of the\r\nburrowing mayfly _Hexagenia_; that of the other female (OU 27594)\r\ncontained exoskeletal remains of crawfish. The two specimens were\r\ndrowned in gill nets between the hours of 11 a. m. and 7 p. m., on\r\nJuly 10, 1954; the intact condition of the mayfly naiads indicated\r\nrecent feeding.\r\n\r\nThe species of American softshells are mainly carnivorous. The presence\r\nof vegetable matter (mentioned in previous paragraphs) in the digestive\r\ntracts of many specimens and True's statement (1893:152) that\r\nsoft-shelled turtles include a variety of vegetable matter in their food\r\nindicates omnivorous habits. Duellman and Schwartz (1958:272) stated\r\nthat _ferox_ is omnivorous and Carr (1952:430) made a similar statement\r\nfor _spinifer_. The diet seems to be determined by the food supply\r\navailable, which may vary seasonally or with adverse conditions such as\r\nflooding; under normal environmental conditions, however, vegetable\r\nmatter probably is ingested incidentally to other food. There is no\r\nindication of a preference in food habits according to species and\r\nsubspecies. Most of the food seems to be obtained by active foraging\r\nthat is triggered primarily by movement of the prey; the sense of smell\r\nis probably secondary.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size of males at Sexual Maturity_\r\n\r\nElsewhere (1956:121) I have shown that males of _spinifer_ from Lake\r\nTexoma, Oklahoma, and scattered localities in Texas and Louisiana\r\nare sexually mature when they reach a plastral length of 9.0-10.0\r\ncentimeters. Adult males have distinct, convoluted, non-pigmented vasa\r\ndeferentia and elongate testes, the maximal measurements of which are\r\nabout 10 by 30 millimeters. Testes of hatchlings are approximately 4.0\r\nby 0.4 millimeters (TU 13698.12, plastral length 3.2 cm., measured with\r\nocular micrometer). I am not aware of seasonal changes in size of the\r\ntestes.\r\n\r\nIn reading the discussion that follows, it is well to remember that\r\nmales having the cloaca extending beyond the posterior edge of the\r\ncarapace are regarded as sexually mature. As an indication of geographic\r\nvariation in _spinifer_, I have listed the measurements of the 10\r\nsmallest males for only those subspecies of which there are numerous\r\nrecords (Table 7). Corresponding data for _T. muticus muticus_ are also\r\nlisted for comparison.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 7. Size at Sexual Maturity of the 10 Smallest Males of T. m.\r\n      muticus and Selected Subspecies of T. spinifer. The Extremes\r\n      Precede the Mean (in Parentheses).\r\n\r\n  ========================+=======================\r\n   SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES | Plastral length (cm.)\r\n  ------------------------+-----------------------\r\n  _T. s. spinifer_        |    8.8-10.3 (9.6)\r\n  _T. s. hartwegi_        |    9.6-10.5 (10.2)\r\n  _T. s. pallidus_        |    9.1-11.2 (10.5)\r\n  _T. s. guadalupensis_   |    9.3-10.8 (10.1)\r\n  _T. s. emoryi_          |    8.2-9.0 (8.8)\r\n  _T. m. muticus_         |    8.2-9.2 (8.7)\r\n  ------------------------+-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe data indicate that the size at which sexual maturity is attained in\r\n_emoryi_ (about 8.0-9.0 cm.) is less than in any other subspecies of _T.\r\nspinifer_ (about 9.0-10.0 cm.), and, more importantly, corresponds to\r\nthat of _T. m. muticus_. Although the mean for _T. s. spinifer_ is\r\nslightly less than in the remaining subspecies, I doubt that there is\r\nany significant difference according to subspecies in the size at which\r\nsexual maturity is attained in the subspecies _spinifer_, _hartwegi_,\r\n_asper_, _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_. The corresponding size in _T.\r\nm. muticus_ and _T. s. emoryi_ heightens the morphological resemblance\r\nbetween these forms. The only sexually mature male of _T. ater_, which\r\nmorphologically resembles _emoryi_ and _muticus_, is 9.5 centimeters in\r\nplastral length. I do not know the size at which _T. ferox_ attains\r\nsexual maturity. The smallest sexually mature individual examined by me\r\nwas 12.0 centimeters; probably _ferox_ attains sexual maturity at a\r\nlarger size than _spinifer_ or _muticus_. The relative size of\r\nattainment of sexual maturity in _ferox_, _spinifer_, and _muticus_\r\ncorresponds to the maximum size of the three species; _ferox_ is the\r\nlargest species and _muticus_ is the smallest (Table 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size of Females at Sexual Maturity_\r\n\r\nBreckenridge (1955:6) wrote that the development of the mottled pattern\r\n\"undoubtedly indicates a stage in the attainment of sexual maturity\"; I\r\nhave mentioned (1956:121) that the mottled pattern is apparent on\r\nfemales before sexual maturity is attained. To my knowledge females have\r\nno external characters which appear at the time of attainment of sexual\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nSexually mature individuals of _ferox_ have been described in various\r\nterms: 31-1/4 pounds (Goff and Goff, 1935:156); six pounds, lengths of\r\ncarapace 10-1/2 and 13 inches (Hamilton, 1947:209); greatest width of\r\nhead 3-1/2 inches (Wright and Funkhouser, 1915:120). A 10-1/2 inch\r\ncarapace presumably represents the smallest turtle and corresponds to a\r\nplastron approximately 22.0 centimeters in length. There is no other\r\ninformation available concerning size at sexual maturity in _T. ferox_.\r\n\r\nThere is little published information concerning the size at sexual\r\nmaturity in _T. spinifer_. Cahn (1937:193) wrote that _spinifer_ in\r\nIllinois \"must attain a carapace length of about 24 centimeters\r\n[plastral length approximately 18.0 cm.] before the females become\r\nsexually mature\"; this statement is the basis for Smith's mentioning a\r\nlength of 9-1/2 inches (1956:162). Evermann and Clark (1920:595)\r\nrecorded the lengths of carapace of some females (presumably all adult)\r\nfrom Lake Maxinkuckee, Indiana, as 11, 11-3/4, 12-1/2, and 13 inches;\r\nthe smallest measurement corresponds to a plastral length of\r\napproximately 21.0 centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe data concerning reproduction presented in succeeding paragraphs is\r\nbased principally upon examinations of turtles in the TU collections; I\r\nam indebted to Dr. Fred R. Cagle for permission to dissect these\r\nturtles. Females are regarded as sexually mature when they have oviducal\r\neggs or corpora lutea or ovarian follicles exceeding 15 millimeters\r\nin diameter. Hatchlings of _spinifer_ have ovaries that measure\r\napproximately 6.0 × 0.3 millimeters, and straight oviducts 0.2\r\nmillimeters in width (TU 5988, plastral length 3.5 cm. measured with\r\nocular micrometer). In the size at which sexual maturity is attained\r\nthere seems to be much individual variation as well as geographic\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nFemales of _T. s. emoryi_ from the Río Grande in the Big Bend region\r\nof Texas are sexually mature when the plastron is approximately 16.0\r\ncentimeters (16.2 cm., KU 51960), and are the smallest adult females\r\nof _spinifer_ that I have seen; these females are representative of\r\nthe population from which the smallest adult males of _spinifer_ are\r\nknown and which is unique in showing sexual differences in coloration.\r\nA female (TU 3697), having a plastral length of 16.0 centimeters,\r\nwhich was obtained in the Río Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas, in\r\nmid-July, is immature; the ovaries are compact having the largest\r\nfollicles 2.5 millimeters in diameter, and the oviduct is wrinkled and\r\nconvoluted but only six millimeters wide. Of three females of _emoryi_\r\nfrom the Pecos River, Terrell County, Texas, having plastrons 17.4,\r\n18.3 and 18.8 centimeters in length and obtained on June 11, the\r\nlargest and smallest are immature, and internally resemble TU 3697. TU\r\n14453.2 (18.3 cm.) is sexually mature having large corpora lutea and\r\nenlarged ovarian follicles. KU 53754, from the Río Salado in central\r\nCoahuila, México, having corpora lutea and a plastral length of 20.3\r\ncentimeters, is sexually mature.\r\n\r\nFemales of _T. s. guadalupensis_, measuring 14.5, 15.7, 16.3, 16.5,\r\n16.8, 17.0, 19.0, and 20.0 centimeters in plastral length and obtained\r\nfrom June to September, are immature. The female measuring 19.0\r\ncentimeters indicates the approach of sexual maturity in having\r\nswollen and convoluted oviducts seven to ten millimeters in width, but\r\ncompact ovaries having the largest follicles 4.0 millimeters. The\r\nother _guadalupensis_ whose measurements are given above have oviducts\r\nthat do not exceed four millimeters in width, and ovarian follicles\r\nthat do not exceed two millimeters in diameter. TU 10187, obtained in\r\nJuly, plastral length 19.5 centimeters, is sexually mature having\r\ncorpora lutea and enlarged follicles. Two other _guadalupensis_, 21.5\r\nand 22.0 centimeters (Pl. 12, top), having ovaries with enlarged\r\novarian follicles (the largest in one, only 11 mm.) are considered\r\nsexually mature.\r\n\r\nConcerning the subspecies _pallidus_, females (all collected in June\r\nor July) measuring 15.7, 16.3, 17.3, 17.5, 18.7, 19.5, 20.8 and 21.3\r\ncentimeters in plastral length are immature having solid, compact\r\novaries with the largest follicles not exceeding two millimeters in\r\ndiameter; oviducts are straight not exceeding three millimeters in\r\ngreatest width, except those turtles measuring 17.3 and 21.3\r\ncentimeters in which the oviducts are swollen and convoluted and,\r\nrespectively, five and eight millimeters in greatest width. The\r\nsmallest sexually mature _pallidus_ is 19.8 centimeters in length;\r\nrecorded lengths of other adult females are 23.5, 26.8 and 30.5\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nOf especial interest are three large female _pallidus_, measuring\r\n24.8, 27.5, and 28.0 centimeters, which appear to be immature; two of\r\nthese (TU 13303-04) are from the Sabine River, collected in July, and\r\nthe other specimen is without data (presumably from the Sabine River).\r\nThe oviducts are large, swollen and convoluted, resembling those in\r\nsexually mature individuals. The ovaries, however, are relatively\r\nsolid and compact having approximate measurements of 125 × 6\r\nmillimeters (TU 13303) and 85 × 10 millimeters (TU 13304), and\r\nfollicles not exceeding five millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\nFemales of _spinifer_ from the lower Mississippi Valley of Louisiana\r\nhaving plastral lengths of 15.0, 15.5, 16.7, 17.5, 18.0, 19.5, 20.0,\r\n20.4, and 20.8 centimeters are considered immature; the ovaries are\r\ncompact and solid having follicles not exceeding three millimeters in\r\ndiameter, and the oviducts, swollen and convoluted in the larger\r\nindividuals, do not exceed six millimeters in width. The ovaries of\r\nthe specimen 19.5 centimeters in length mentioned immediately above\r\nhad been removed prior to my examination; the oviducts, however, were\r\nrelatively straight and only five millimeters in width. Three females\r\n23.0, 25.5, and 25.8 centimeters in length are sexually mature. TU\r\n5518, measuring 21.5 centimeters in length and obtained in June,\r\nindicates the onset of sexual maturity in having large convoluted\r\noviducts, but the ovaries are solid, compact, measuring 85 × 13\r\nmillimeters, and the largest follicles are only 4.5 millimeters. A\r\nlarger turtle (TU 13080), 24.5 centimeters, obtained in July, has\r\njuvenal ovaries (largest follicles five mm.); the oviducts are\r\nenlarged and convoluted as in adult females.\r\n\r\nOf two _T. s. asper_ collected from the Escambia River in June and\r\nJuly, one 18.0 centimeters in plastral length is immature, whereas the\r\nother, 27.0 centimeters long, is adult. A female _T. s. hartwegi_,\r\nmeasuring 20.7 centimeters, is adult having enlarged follicles and\r\ncorpora lutea (TTC 719, Pl. 36, bottom).\r\n\r\nIn summary, females of all subspecies of _spinifer_, except some\r\n_emoryi_, may be sexually mature when the plastron is 18.0 to 20.0\r\ncentimeters in length; probably all physiologically normal females are\r\nadult when 22.0 centimeters long. In general, females are sexually\r\nmature at a plastral length of approximately 20.0 centimeters, a\r\nmeasurement that corresponds to a length of carapace of approximately\r\n28.0 centimeters or about 11 inches. Females representative of that\r\npopulation of _emoryi_ inhabiting the Río Conchos and the Río Grande\r\nin the Big Bend region of Texas are adult when the plastron is\r\napproximately 16.0 centimeters in length, and are thus the smallest\r\nsexually mature females of the species _spinifer_. Oviducts are large\r\n(at least eight mm. in width, undistended), swollen and convoluted prior\r\nto the first ovulation.\r\n\r\nOf interest are the large females (for example, TU 13303, plastral\r\nlength 28.0 cm.) that seemingly have immature, relatively small, ovaries\r\n(the oviducts are large and convoluted as in adult females). Possibly\r\nsuch ovaries represent a regression and are in senile turtles, but I am\r\ninclined to believe that the development of these ovaries has been\r\narrested probably owing to hormonal unbalance, and that they have never\r\nbeen functional.\r\n\r\nThe size of adult females of _T. ater_ is unknown but probably\r\napproximates that of _T. spinifer_ or is slightly less. Females of\r\n_ater_ 15.5 and 17.2 centimeters in length are immature; the largest\r\nfemale, the holotype, is 18.3 centimeters in length, and was not\r\ndissected.\r\n\r\nFemales of _T. muticus_ are sexually mature when smaller than _T.\r\nspinifer_. Two turtles, 13.8 and 14.0 centimeters in length, have large\r\nconvoluted oviducts about 10 millimeters in width and ovarian follicles\r\nnine to twelve millimeters in diameter, and seem to be near sexual\r\nmaturity. The smallest sexually mature female (subspecies _muticus_) is\r\nTU 14436, measuring 14.4 centimeters in plastral length and having\r\noviducal eggs. Recorded lengths of other adult females are 16.3, 16.5,\r\n17.2 (subspecies _muticus_), and 18.0 centimeters (subspecies\r\n_calvatus_). Two females having plastral lengths of 17.5 (subspecies\r\n_muticus_) and 16.0 centimeters (subspecies _calvatus_) seem sexually\r\nimmature. These turtles collected in April and May have ovarian\r\nfollicles not exceeding three millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual Activity_\r\n\r\nObservations by Mitsukuri (1905:263), Conant (1951:160) and Legler\r\n(1955:98), constitute the extent of our knowledge concerning courtship\r\nand copulation. Legler observed a male _spinifer_ and a female _muticus_\r\nin captivity; the male was the aggressor, following at the rear or above\r\nthe female, and at times nipping at the anterior part of her carapace.\r\nDuring these movements, the posterior edge of the female's carapace was\r\nturned up slightly whereas that of the male was turned down; the turtles\r\nfrequently surfaced to breathe. Occasionally the female followed the\r\nmale. On the bottom the male crawled onto the female's carapace from the\r\nrear, remaining in a somewhat posterior position as described by Conant\r\n(_loc. cit._), and seemingly not clasping the female with his feet.\r\nCopulation probably occurs in this position; Mitsukuri (_loc. cit._)\r\nmentioned that copulation in _Trionyx sinensis_ occurs at the surface of\r\nthe water. The male remains in the coital position for approximately 15\r\nseconds and then slowly drifts to one side and swims away. Legler\r\nobserved five coital unions in one-half hour, each preceded by courting\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nLegler's observations indicate that the courtship patterns of _muticus_\r\nand _spinifer_ are similar, and that interspecific matings are possible.\r\nI have not noted any hybrid.\r\n\r\nRisley (1933:689) mentioned differential movements of the sexes of\r\n_Sternothaerus odoratus_ in conjunction with the breeding cycle. Such\r\nmovements are revealed by trapping procedures that yield deviations from\r\nthe expected 1:1 sex ratio. That differential sexual movements probably\r\noccur in _Trionyx_ is indicated by my trapping 17 males in a group of 19\r\n_spinifer_ in hoop-nets in Lake Texoma in the period June 14-July 12,\r\n1954. On June 24-26, 1959, a field party from the University of Kansas\r\ncollected 15 softshells in hoop-nets at the mouth of the Río San Pedro,\r\nnear Meoquí, Chihuahua; all turtles were males. On June 17-18, 1959, the\r\nsame expedition trapped 11 males in a group of 13 turtles in the Río\r\nConchos, near Ojinaga, Chihuahua. Earlier, June 12-14, 1959, 39\r\nsoftshells were trapped in the Río Grande near Lajitas, Brewster County,\r\nTexas. Of these turtles, however, 19 were adult males and 20 were\r\nfemales; eight females were adult (sexually mature) all having oviducal\r\neggs (Fig. 23). One of the two females from Ojinaga, KU 51174, is\r\nsexually mature (plastral length, 16.5 cm.) having oviducal eggs; the\r\nother is immature (plastral length, 8.0 cm.). The only softshell taken\r\non June 21, 1959, 8 mi. N and 16 mi. W Ojinaga, KU 51173 (plastral\r\nlength, 16.3 cm.) is a female having oviducal eggs. The two females from\r\nLake Texoma are immature (plastral lengths, 9.8 and 12.4 cm.).\r\n\r\nThe results of trapping may indicate that females frequent shallow water\r\nfor a short time before the period of deposition of eggs, but disperse\r\nto deep water after such periods or between them. The movements of\r\nimmature females probably approximate those of adult males; the absence\r\nof immature females in the Meoquí series, and near absence (only one) in\r\nthe Ojinaga series perhaps is due to fortuitous collecting methods or to\r\nslightly different diurnal movements between adult males and immature\r\nfemales. Females approaching sexual maturity and those sexually mature\r\nbut not having oviducal eggs ready for deposition possibly remain\r\nrelatively sedentary in deep water; such females possibly represent\r\nthose absent in the 13.0-15.9 size group (Fig. 23). Certainly, factors\r\nother than those pertaining to egg deposition may cause mature egg-laden\r\nfemales to live in shallow water, or explain the deviations from the\r\nexpected 1:1 ratio.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 23. Size distribution of 39 _Trionyx spinifer\r\n      emoryi_ (19 males and 20 females) collected in the period June 12\r\n      through June 14, 1959, from the Río Grande, near Lajitas, Brewster\r\n      County, Texas. Solid squares represent sexually mature specimens.\r\n      Females approaching sexual maturity or those not ready for egg\r\n      deposition (13.0-15.9 cm. size group) are possibly sedentary in\r\n      deep water.]\r\n\r\nOne of the immature softshells (KU 51979, plastral length, 9.7 cm.) of\r\nthe series from Lajitas is considered to be a female. It combines\r\ncharacteristics of both sexes. It resembles a male in having a carapace\r\ngritty to the touch, in having prominent white dots posteriorly and in\r\nnot having a faint mottled and blotched pattern as do females of the\r\nsame size. The postocular and postlabial markings are mostly yellow\r\n(female), but a small patch of the postocular stripe near the junction\r\nwith the pale ventral coloration laterally is tinted with orange (male);\r\nthe morphological characters and secondary sexual difference in\r\ncoloration of this series of softshells has been mentioned on page 512.\r\nThe tail is short and pyramidal resembling that of a female. Internally,\r\nthere are a pair of ovaries and oviducts; KU 51979 is functionally a\r\nfemale. An over-production of androgens probably is responsible for the\r\nexternal masculine characteristics (orange color, gritty carapace and\r\nabsence of mottling on carapace).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deposition of Eggs_\r\n\r\nConcerning _T. ferox_, Wright and Funkhouser (1915:122-23) wrote that\r\ndeposition of eggs occurred in June and July in the Okefinokee Swamp\r\non the sandy parts of the islands or in sandy fields in places exposed\r\nto the direct rays of the sun. The same authors recorded a gravid\r\nfemale taken on June 22 (_op. cit._:120), and a nest with eggs on June\r\n26. Harper (1926:415) reported egg-laying in June in the Okefinokee\r\nSwamp. Goff and Goff (1935:156) found a female in search of a nesting\r\nsite crawling toward a cleared area within a hammock at 11 a. m. on\r\nMay 19, about 25 yards from the western shore of Lake Griffin,\r\nFlorida. Carr (1940:107) stated that eggs in Florida \"are laid from\r\nMarch to July 10. One individual laid her eggs on a block of ice which\r\nwe had buried in the sand.\" Hamilton (1947:209) observed deposition of\r\neggs near Fort Myers, Florida, in \"a sandy roadbed slightly above the\r\ncypress swamp and ditch levels on either side of the road.\" ... either\r\nin ... \"the ruts formed by cars or the slope of the roadbed\"; dates of\r\ndeposition of eggs recorded are March 30 at 11 a. m. in bright sun,\r\nand March 31 (from context, the date given as March 21 is considered\r\nan error) at 5 p. m. following a heavy rain. The daily temperatures at\r\nthe time of Hamilton's observations \"averaged 85° F., the first really\r\nwarm spell of the season.\"\r\n\r\nEigenmann (1896:262) reported egg-laying of _spinifer_ in sand and\r\ngravel in June and July at Turkey Lake (= Lake Wawasee), Indiana. A\r\nturtle was seen digging a nest on June 26, and fresh nests of eggs\r\nwere found on June 27 and July 9. Hedrick and Holmes (1956:126) wrote\r\nthat a clutch of eggs of _spinifer_ in Minnesota was found about ten\r\ninches deep in sand about one foot from the river; a steep gravel bank\r\nwas also cited as a favorite nesting site. Surface (1908:123) stated\r\nthat eggs of _spinifer_ in Pennsylvania are laid in May, and the young\r\nhatch in August. Gehlbach and Collette (1959:142) found eggs of\r\n_spinifer_ on June 19 on a sand bank 15 feet from the edge of the\r\nPlatte River in Nebraska. Breckenridge (1944:187) wrote that\r\n_spinifer_ in Minnesota nests on sandy beaches from June 14 to July 6.\r\nCahn (1937:193) stated that deposition of eggs in Illinois occurs in\r\n\"June or early July: earlier in the southern part of the state, later\r\nin the northern portion.\" Force (1930:38) mentioned a gravid female\r\nfrom Oklahoma obtained on May 20. Evermann and Clark (1920:593) were\r\nof the opinion that _spinifer_ began laying about mid-June and\r\ncontinued until perhaps late July at Lake Maxinkuckee, Indiana; a\r\nfemale opened on June 14 had oviducal eggs, and the first nest was\r\nfound on June 18. Nests were usually at the edge of an abrupt ascent\r\nin sand; one nest was found in black, mucky soil (_op. cit._:595).\r\nNewman (1906:128) wrote that _spinifer_ in the same lake nests later\r\nthan the other species of turtles, as a rule not earlier than the\r\nmiddle of June (but as early as June 10, _op. cit._:132), and rarely\r\nlater than the middle of July; he observed deposition of eggs on June\r\n22. Sites of deposition of eggs were mostly in soft sand not more than\r\nsix feet from water; other sites found by Newman (_op. cit._:132-33)\r\nwere a sandy, abandoned road bed separated from the shore by a strip\r\nof tall grass, a rock pile (the eggs being dropped into crevices and\r\nsand packed around them), among roots of a tree (the eggs being\r\ndeposited between the roots and under them in a very irregular\r\nfashion), and in clay \"so hard packed that one could scarcely break it\r\nwith the fingers.\" Natural nest sites in hard clay and a rock pile\r\nseem incongruous with nesting habits of softshells. I note that\r\nNewman's study was not begun until 1902 (_op. cit._:127), and it was\r\nthat year that the water level of the lake was high, flooding the\r\nsurrounding lowlands (Evermann and Clark, 1920:49-53). Perhaps some of\r\nthe nests found by Newman were old and not natural because of\r\nconditions resulting from the receding water level.\r\n\r\nNewman (_op. cit._:134-35) mentioned that in small sandy areas nests\r\nwere frequently in contact and overlapped; he found one nest\r\ncontaining nine small eggs contiguous with 23 large eggs. Breckenridge\r\n(1944:187) reported a nest of 56 eggs of two slightly differing sizes,\r\nand probably from two females. Evermann and Clark (1920:594)\r\ndiscovered \"probably 10 or 12 nests in a distance of a few yards\" and\r\nmentioned one nest containing 25 eggs \"that evidently belonged to two\r\ndifferent sets ... In the bottom were 10 eggs that looked old ... and\r\n... separated from them by sand, were 15 other eggs.\"\r\n\r\nNesting sites of _muticus_ were mentioned by Muller (1921:181) on one\r\nof several small islands having \"gently sloping sand and mud shores,\r\nand interior areas of open sand and densely growing willows\" in the\r\nMississippi River, near Fairport, Iowa. The same author wrote that the\r\negg-laying season is from late June to early July, and that the female\r\nselected a place 10 to 60 feet inland \"with an unobstructed view of\r\nthe open water.\" Farther north on the Mississippi River near Dubuque,\r\nIowa, Goldsmith (1945:447) found that _muticus_ preferred \"clean,\r\nsomewhat level sandbars and sandy shores free from trash, weeds ...\r\nand exposed to open view.\" The same species, however, may \"make\r\nunsatisfactory nests ... in any place they can find sand, even in the\r\nweeds and bushes ... when the river is high, covering the sandy plots\r\n...\" Sometimes nests, which were \"seldom nearer than six feet or more\r\nthan twenty-five feet from water ...,\" were submerged by a rise in\r\nwater level. In Missouri, Hurter (1911:251) found that individuals of\r\n_muticus_ came \"... out on the sandbars in the Mississippi River to\r\ndeposit their eggs ... At the end of May up to the middle of June ...\"\r\nCahn (1937:182) wrote that the nesting season of _muticus_ is early\r\nJuly near Meredosia, Illinois. Anderson (1958:212, Fig. 1) found nests\r\nof _muticus_ along the Pearl River in Louisiana on an open sandbar\r\n(not in gravel, fine sand or silt), whereas nests of _Graptemys_ were\r\nconfined to the landward margin of the sandbar.\r\n\r\nThe onset and length of the breeding season seems to be geared to the\r\nclimatic conditions under which the species occurs, and, as would be\r\nexpected, begins earlier and lasts longer in southern latitudes than\r\nin northern latitudes. The period of deposition of eggs in _T. ferox_\r\n(Florida) is from late March to mid-July, whereas that of northern\r\npopulations of _spinifer_ and _muticus_ (southern Great Lakes region)\r\nis usually from mid-June to mid-July.\r\n\r\nSeemingly there is little difference between species in preference of\r\nnesting sites; a sandy substrate is probably preferred. Gravid females\r\nof _ferox_ and _spinifer_ may wander overland some distance and select\r\nplaces where the view of the water is obstructed by vegetation; both\r\nspecies may wander little and nest in full view of the water.\r\nConcerning _muticus_, it is of interest that of the many nests\r\ndiscovered by Anderson (_loc. cit._) on an open sandbar, all were\r\nthose of _muticus_ and none was a nest of _spinifer_. The nests of\r\n_muticus_ mentioned by Muller (_loc. cit._) and Goldsmith (_loc.\r\ncit._) were on open sandbars. On June 4, 1953, six clutches of eggs\r\nwere found on an open sandbar of the Escambia River, Florida; all\r\nhatchlings from those eggs that were successfully incubated were\r\n_muticus_. On June 1, 1954, three nests were found on an open sandbar\r\nof the same river (Pl. 50); the temperature within the nests at 6:30\r\na. m. was approximately 25° C. Two nests were dug in a sand substrate\r\non the level portion of the bar (Pl. 51, Fig. 1). The third clutch of\r\neggs was deposited in a sand-gravel substrate at the brim of the\r\nincline from the shore (approximately 30 degrees and about five feet\r\nabove the water); the eggs of this clutch were arranged rather\r\nsymmetrically (Pl. 51, Fig. 2). Unfortunately, most of the eggs from\r\nthese three clutches failed to hatch. Although the data are far from\r\nconclusive, I have the impression that _muticus_ limits its sites of\r\negg deposition to the open regions of sand bars and does not lay\r\ninland where it must traverse vegetated areas unless preferred nesting\r\nsites are submerged or otherwise unsatisfactory. Females of _spinifer_\r\nmay utilize open sandbars for deposition of eggs but not areas where\r\n_muticus_ occurs. In areas where both _muticus_ and _spinifer_ occur,\r\nthe latter probably lays farther inland or on the landward margins of\r\nsandbars.\r\n\r\nExcavation of nests has been observed in _ferox_ (Hamilton, 1947:209),\r\n_muticus_ (Muller, 1921:181-82; Goldsmith, 1945:448), and _spinifer_\r\n(Newman, 1906:132-33; Cahn, 1937:191-92; Breckenridge, 1960:284).\r\nTurtles leaving the water are cautious, usually stopping and extending\r\nthe neck to its greatest length, holding the head high, and sometimes\r\nreturning to the water for a short time. Depending on the condition of\r\nthe substrate and wariness of the female, nest construction may begin\r\nimmediately, or several holes may be dug and then abandoned. The\r\nexcavation on level ground or a slight incline is made by means of the\r\nhind feet (Muller mentions digging with the forefeet; I agree with\r\nPope, 1949:321, and Conant, 1951:264, who consider Muller in error);\r\nthe forefeet are firmly planted and not moved during the excavation,\r\ndeposition of eggs or the filling of the nest cavity. The hind feet\r\nare used alternately; cloacal water may be used to facilitate digging\r\nor to provide a suitable substrate for the eggs. Cahn mentioned that\r\nsome sand may be flung four or five feet, and that during the digging\r\nthe head is held high. Breckenridge (_loc. cit._) reported that sand\r\nwas thrown a distance of ten feet. The nest may be completed in 16\r\nminutes (Cahn, _loc. cit._) or less than 40 minutes (Newman, _loc.\r\ncit._). Breckenridge recorded 17 eggs laid in six minutes, Cahn\r\nrecorded 12 eggs laid in eight minutes, and Hamilton recorded four\r\neggs laid in three minutes. The hind feet are used to arrange the eggs\r\nand are used alternately to fill the nest cavity; sometimes a little\r\nsand is scraped in before all the eggs are deposited. Muller recorded\r\nthe nest cavity as five inches in diameter and ten inches deep, the\r\nfinished nest appearing \"as a small crater ... about a foot in\r\ndiameter, or where the surface is covered with pebbles, as a circular\r\narea of clear sand.\" Goldsmith reported that the nest cavity was six\r\nto nine inches in depth, and that after deposition and filling with\r\nsand \"By certain twisting movements with all four legs, she drags the\r\nplastron around over the sand, making a perfect camouflage.\" Newman\r\nfound the nest flask-shaped having a depth of about six inches, and\r\ndiameters of about three inches at the bottom and one and one-half\r\ninches in the neck. Hamilton described a flask-shaped nest, the\r\nentrance of which would \"barely permit the passage of an egg ... the\r\nbottom, at a depth of five inches, being about the width of a quart\r\nmilk bottle.\" Cahn related that the \"hole descended at an angle of\r\nabout 60°,\" and the eggs thus rolled down an inclined plane.\r\n\r\nPossibly the nests of _ferox_ and _spinifer_ differ from those of\r\n_muticus_ in being flask-shaped. A nest of _spinifer_ was reported by\r\nGehlbach and Collette (_loc. cit._) as having a neck three inches\r\nacross, a depth of six inches and a width of five inches at the\r\nbottom. The nests of _muticus_ that I discovered on the Escambia River\r\nwere not flask-shaped; the eggs were five to seven inches below the\r\nsurface. Evermann and Clark (1920:594) reported eggs of _spinifer_\r\n\"generally at a depth of four to ten inches,\" and Breckenridge (_loc.\r\ncit._) found the topmost eggs about five inches below the surface.\r\nThere may be behavioral differences between _ferox_ and _spinifer_ and\r\n_muticus_. Hamilton (_loc. cit._) mentioned that _ferox_ proceeded\r\nwith its reproductive duties even when he stood only a few yards away.\r\nMuller (_op. cit._:181) found that _muticus_ would run to the water if\r\ndisturbed, without completing deposition of eggs; the same behavior\r\nwas described by Cahn (_op. cit._:191) for _spinifer_. Newman\r\n(1906:133) wrote that _spinifer_ will abandon nesting activities if\r\nsurprised before egg deposition begins, but will wait to cover the\r\neggs if interrupted while laying eggs. Goldsmith (1945:448) found that\r\nan observer did not disturb females of _muticus_ when they were laying\r\neggs (females \"could be approached and even touched\"), but that, in\r\nthe presence of an observer, they would scurry toward the water\r\nwithout covering the eggs and would not return to cover them. Turtles\r\nfrightened in the process of the construction of the nests would not\r\nreturn to complete the original nest. Harper (1926:415) wrote that\r\n_ferox_, after completing nesting activities, will crawl a few feet\r\nfrom the nest and scuffle up the surface, presumably to decoy\r\npredators that might otherwise destroy the eggs; this observation has\r\nnot been corroborated by other authors. Harper (_op. cit._:416)\r\nrecorded the observation of Allen Chesser, who says that females,\r\nafter egg deposition, often \"... bury themselves, before they go ter\r\nthe water, an' stay there ten er twelve hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reproductive Potential_\r\n\r\nEstimates of reproductive potentials are subject to variation of one\r\nkind or another. Counts of oviducal eggs or those in nests may be\r\nmisleading, as in some individuals one or more eggs may have been\r\ndeposited previously. Mitsukuri (1905:263), Newman (1906:135), Muller\r\n(1921:182), and Cahn (1937:183) have mentioned that the number of eggs\r\nper clutch corresponds to the size of the female. Females of northern\r\npopulations may have larger clutches than females of the same size\r\nfrom southern populations.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 8.

Except for those of\r\n_ferox_, most of these records are based on observations in northern\r\nlatitudes (approximately 40°). My examination of females from southern\r\nlatitudes (below 36.5°) reveals no oviducal egg count greater than 17\r\nand an average number of eggs per clutch of 9.6 per _spinifer_ (Table\r\n9); that of _muticus_ is 7.3, as based on data given in Table 9 as\r\nwell as on egg-nest counts of 15, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 9, 8, and 8. Ovarian\r\nfollicles larger than 15 millimeters in diameter are arbitrarily\r\nconsidered to comprise the next clutch that will be deposited in the\r\ncurrent season. Follicles of this size possibly are retained until the\r\nfollowing year or some may undergo regression; some of the included\r\nfollicles may not be representative of the succeeding egg complement.\r\nThe average number of follicles of the most enlarged groups is 9.0 for\r\n_spinifer_ and 10.5 for _muticus_. Females in northern latitudes\r\nprobably have a greater reproductive potential than those in southern\r\nlatitudes if it is assumed that there is only one laying per season\r\nfor an individual; the maximum number of eggs laid at any one time\r\nprobably does not exceed 35. There is also an indication that larger\r\nfemales deposit more eggs than smaller females (Table 9). Muller\r\n(1921:184) mentioned two double eggs (each having two yolks) in the\r\ncomplement of 33, indicating an abnormally large number and excessive\r\ncrowding of eggs in the oviducts. Simkins (1925:188) also mentioned\r\nsome eggs of a clutch (form and locality unknown) that were five or\r\nsix millimeters larger (about 31-32 mm.) than the rest, and which\r\n\"invariably bore twins.\" The largest number of eggs in a single nest\r\nmentioned by Simkins is 22. If the presence of double-yolked eggs is\r\nindicative of crowding of eggs in the oviducts, the egg complements of\r\n22 and 33 indicate the approximate maximal number of eggs per clutch.\r\nIn the species _spinifer_, the average size of sexually mature females\r\nis slightly smaller at some places in the south than in the north.\r\nTherefore, smaller clutches are to be expected in the south.\r\n\r\nMany of the females collected in June or July contained corpora lutea\r\nfour to eight millimeters in diameter in addition to enlarged ovarian\r\nfollicles. Presumably the corpora lutea indicate clutches deposited\r\nearlier in the current season, and the enlarged follicles represent\r\nclutches to be deposited in the current season. One female of\r\n_muticus_ (OU 27593) obtained on July 10, contains oviducal eggs,\r\novarian follicles 15-17 millimeters in diameter, and corpora lutea of\r\ndifferent sizes that exceed the number of oviducal eggs; possibly this\r\nfemale was capable of laying three clutches each season. Corpora\r\nlutea, representing ovulation points of eggs in the oviducts, are\r\napproximately eight millimeters in diameter. In order to establish\r\ndefinitely the reproductive potentials of any species of turtle, it is\r\ndesirable to know the approximate size of ovarian follicles that are\r\nretained by sexually inactive females, and the rate of regression of\r\nthe corpora lutea. The data suggest that, in southern populations at\r\nleast, two and possibly three clutches of eggs are deposited in the\r\nannual breeding season. Mitsukuri (_in_ Cagle, 1950:38) found that _T.\r\nsinensis_ deposited four groups of eggs each season.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the seasonal reproductive potential of northern\r\npopulations (averaging about 20 eggs per clutch, and probably one\r\nclutch per season) is less than that for southern populations\r\n(averaging about 10 eggs per clutch, but three clutches per season).\r\nBut owing to variation, there may be no great discrepancy between the\r\nactual potentials of northern and southern populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eggs_\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Trionyx_ are white and spherical having a brittle shell.\r\nSome eggs are occasionally abnormal in shape and size; overcrowding of\r\neggs in the oviducts may result in small, irregular-shaped eggs, or\r\nlarge double-yolked eggs. Presumably enlargement of the eggs occurs in\r\nthe oviducts and within a short period after deposition prior to\r\ncomplete hardening of the brittle shell; therefore some eggs in the\r\noviducts are smaller than those in nests.\r\n\r\nThe data concerning _ferox_ (Table 8) suggest that the maximum size of\r\neggs is 31 to 32 millimeters, whereas oviducal eggs are slightly\r\nsmaller, about 25 to 27 millimeters. Eggs of _spinifer_ from northern\r\nlatitudes (most from approximately 40°, Table 8) also vary in size,\r\noviducal eggs being as small as 22 millimeters in diameter and the\r\nmaximal size about 29 millimeters. Average extreme measurements (in\r\nmm.) of oviducal eggs (number of eggs in parentheses) from females\r\ntaken in latitudes of 33 degrees or less are: 25 × 29 (11), 29 × 30\r\n(11), 28 × 30 (13), 28 × 30 (10), 29 × 30 (5), 29 × 29 (8), 25 × 26\r\n(17), 29 × 30 (5), and 28 × 29 (8). The average size of these eggs is\r\nslightly larger than the oviducal eggs of which measurements are given\r\nin Table 8, and suggest larger eggs from more southern latitudes. Eggs\r\nof _muticus_ are smaller than those of _spinifer_ (Cahn, 1937:183) or\r\n_ferox_; the average size of eggs from nests found in Iowa and\r\nIllinois is 22 to 23 millimeters (Table 8). Nine oviducal eggs from a\r\nfemale obtained in Lake Texoma, Oklahoma, averaged 22 × 23\r\nmillimeters. The largest eggs of _muticus_ are from the southernmost\r\nlocality; eight eggs from a nest found along the Escambia River,\r\nFlorida, averaged 26 × 27 millimeters.\r\n\r\nIn general, the data suggest that at each laying slightly smaller eggs\r\nbut larger numbers are laid by females in northern latitudes, whereas\r\nlarger but fewer eggs are laid by females from farther south.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Incubation and Hatching_\r\n\r\nLength of the incubation period seems to depend upon conditions of\r\nheat and moisture, and, in general, to be geared to the prevailing\r\nclimatic conditions. Goff and Goff (1935:156) artificially incubated\r\nsome eggs of _ferox_ at temperatures varying from 82.3 to 89.2° F.,\r\nand found that the incubation period was 64 days. Muller (1921:184)\r\nwrote that the period of incubation of eggs of _muticus_ (natural\r\nnests at temperatures about 90°., _op. cit._:182, and artificial\r\nnests) in Iowa is from 70 to 75 days. Breckenridge (1944:187) stated\r\nthat _spinifer_ makes nests in Minnesota from June 14 to July 6, and\r\ncited reports that indicate hatching in September. Hedrick and Holmes\r\n(1956:126) discovered a nest of eggs in Minnesota on September 5; the\r\neggs were artificially incubated and some hatched on October 29.\r\nEigenmann (1896:263) found eggs as late as September in northern\r\nIndiana that \"contained young which would have been ready to hatch\r\nabout a month later.\" Cahn (1937:193) wrote that _spinifer_ in\r\nIllinois lays in June or early July and that \"young-of-the-year are\r\ntaken in late August and September.\" Some recently deposited eggs of\r\n_muticus_ (as indicated by fresh turtle tracks, Pl. 50, Fig. 2) that I\r\nobtained on June 1 were artificially incubated and hatched on August\r\n4, indicating an approximate incubation period of 65 days. Dr. Paul K.\r\nAnderson in the course of field work on the Pearl River, Louisiana\r\n(1958:211), found that eggs collected on June 13 from a nest excavated\r\nthree to five days before, hatched on August 15, indicating an\r\nincubation period of approximately 67 days. Eggs collected on May 17\r\nto 25 (three clutches) hatched on August 4 to 6, indicating an\r\nincubation period of approximately 77 days. In any latitude the\r\nincubation period probably is at least 60 days. Eigenmann (_loc.\r\ncit._), however, mentioned empty nests that were found in July; this\r\nindicates early hatching or more probably the action of predators.\r\n\r\nIn northern latitudes eggs or young turtles may over-winter in the\r\nnest if deposition is late in the season. In northern Indiana Evermann\r\nand Clark (1920:595) found a nest on November 16 that contained\r\n\"well-formed young\" and believed that the turtles would have wintered\r\nin the nest. Conant (1951:160) was of the opinion that most eggs\r\nprobably hatch in early fall, but that some do not hatch until spring.\r\n\r\nThe hatching of eggs of _muticus_ has been described by Muller\r\n(1921:183). According to him, the forelimbs first emerge through the\r\nshell and enlarge the opening. There is an \"egg tooth below the\r\nflexible proboscis\" but \"it does not seem to be used in escape from\r\nthe eggs, and is dropped a week after hatching.\" Hatchlings burrow\r\nalmost straight upward through the sand leaving the egg shell below\r\nthe surface and a hole in the sand about an inch in diameter. Muller\r\nfound that young turtles emerge from the nests in the night or early\r\nmorning and always go downhill probably influenced in their movements\r\nby the open sky and sloping beach. Anderson (1958:212-15) found that\r\nhatchlings of _muticus_ leave nests within the first three hours after\r\nsunset and travel a direct route to the water. He discovered that\r\nhatchlings are active on the surface of the sand at night and\r\ngenerally show a positive reaction to light (moonlight, flashlight),\r\nwhereas, in daytime, there is a negative reaction to bright sunlight\r\n(causing the turtles to bury themselves in sand). Anderson believed\r\nthat the positive response to light at night is not correlated with\r\nthe water-approach behavior of hatchlings, but that movements to water\r\nare possibly influenced by a negative reaction to dark masses of\r\nenvironment (such as shadows formed by landward forests).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Age and Growth_\r\n\r\nGoff and Goff (1935:156) found that hatchlings of _ferox_ average 8.82\r\ngrams (extremes, 8.50 to 9.25); one of these, UMMZ 76755, is\r\nillustrated in Plate 31. Muller (1921:184) recorded measurements of\r\nfive hatchlings of _muticus_; the average measurements (in cm.,\r\nextremes in parentheses) were: length of carapace, 3.54 (3.43 to\r\n3.67); width of carapace, 3.20 (3.10 to 3.25); length of plastron,\r\n2.54 (2.47 to 2.60). I recorded measurements of 32 hatchlings (three\r\nclutches combined) of _muticus_ on August 16; the turtles hatched on\r\nAugust 4 to 6 from eggs collected along the Pearl River, Louisiana.\r\nThe average measurements (in mm., extremes in parentheses) of the 32\r\nturtles were: length of carapace, 41.3 (34.0 to 45.0); width of\r\ncarapace, 38.6 (31.0 to 40.0); length of plastron, 30.1 (25.0 to\r\n32.0). These turtles have circular umbilical scars averaging\r\napproximately two millimeters in diameter. The smallest hatchling that\r\nI have seen measures 21.0 millimeters in plastral length (_T. m.\r\nmuticus_, INHS 3458). There are no data to indicate a difference in\r\nsize of hatchlings among the American species of soft-shelled turtles.\r\nThe average plastral length of most hatchlings probably is 28.0 to\r\n30.0 millimeters.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lack of a horny epidermal covering of the carapace and\r\nplastron, soft-shelled turtles are not so well suited to studies of\r\nage and growth as are the \"hard-shelled\" species, which have visible\r\nimpressions of growth annuli on the epidermal scutes. Mattox\r\n(1936:255) found annular rings in the long bones of specimens of\r\n_Chrysemys_ and suggested that it is tenable to correlate the number\r\nof rings with the age of the turtle.\r\n\r\nMitsukuri (1905:265) reported that in hatchlings of _Trionyx sinensis_\r\nthe length of the carapace averages 2.7 centimeters (hatchlings of\r\n_sinensis_ seem to average smaller than any American species), and\r\nthat the average length of carapace (cm.) at the end of the first year\r\nis 4.5, second year 10.5, third year 12.5, fourth year 16.0, and end\r\nof fifth year 17.5; he stated also that females of _sinensis_ are\r\nsexually mature in their sixth year. Breckenridge (1955:7-9) computed\r\na growth curve based on 11 recaptures of females of _spinifer_ in\r\nMinnesota; his data on rate of growth for the first five years do not\r\ndiffer appreciably from those of Mitsukuri. As most females of\r\n_spinifer_ are sexually mature when the carapace is about 11 inches\r\nlong, the age at sexual maturity is approximately 12 years according\r\nto Breckenridge (_op. cit._:8, Fig. 4). The discrepancy in age of\r\nfemales at the size of attainment of sexual maturity (Mitsukuri--six\r\nyears; Breckenridge--12 years) is, in part, rectified by the fact that\r\n_Trionyx sinensis_ probably is a smaller species. Also, Breckenridge's\r\ncomputation of the growth curve is based on continuously decreasing\r\nincrements of growth and seemingly eliminates consideration of the\r\nprobable marked decrease in rate of growth that occurs when sexual\r\nmaturity is attained--a phenomenon noted in other species of turtles.\r\nI think that increments of growth of immature turtles are, on the\r\naverage, larger than those of sexually mature turtles. Judging from\r\nthese criteria, the age of a female of _spinifer_ at sexual maturity\r\nis less than 12 years, and turtles having carapaces 17 to 18 inches in\r\nlength (maximal size for _spinifer_) would be older than 53 years\r\n(_op. cit._:9). Occasional individuals, however, may greatly exceed\r\nthe usual growth rate in which event large adults may be younger than\r\n50 years.\r\n\r\nFemales of _muticus_ are sexually mature when the plastron is 14.0 to\r\n16.0 centimeters long, which corresponds to a carapace 19.6 to 22.4\r\ncentimeters (about 7-3/4 to 8-3/4 inches) long (average CL/PL\r\napproximately 1.4, see Fig. 13). The smaller adult females probably\r\nmature sexually in their sixth year, but most probably do so when\r\nseven years old. Accordingly, some _T. spinifer emoryi_, which are\r\nsexually mature at a plastral length of 16.0 centimeters, are also\r\nsexually mature in their seventh year, whereas most _spinifer_\r\n(sexually mature at a plastral length of 18.0 to 20.0 cm.,\r\ncorresponding to a length of carapace of 25.2 to 28.0 cm. or about 10\r\nto 11 inches) probably become sexually mature in their ninth year, and\r\nsome when eight years old. Most males of _spinifer_ are sexually\r\nmature when the plastron is 9.0 to 10.0 centimeters long (length of\r\ncarapace 12.6 to 14.0 cm. or 5 to 5-1/2 inches), whereas males of\r\n_muticus_ and some _T. spinifer emoryi_ are sexually mature at a\r\nplastral length of 8.0 to 9.0 centimeters (length of carapace 11.2 to\r\n12.6 cm. or 4-1/2 to 5 inches). The smaller adult males are probably\r\nsexually mature in their fourth growing season. Breckenridge (_op.\r\ncit._:7, Tab. II) commented on the abundance of females between five\r\nand 12 inches in length, and males that ranged in length from five to\r\nseven inches. The abundance of turtles in these size ranges is\r\nprobably due, in part, to a slowing of the rate of growth indicating\r\nthe approach of sexual maturity; the abundance of the smallest males\r\nis especially in accord with the size at sexual maturity of males\r\n(about five inches).\r\n\r\nThe largest acceptable record of size of _spinifer_ is 18 inches in\r\nlength of carapace (Breckenridge, 1957:232). Stockwell (1878:402),\r\nhowever, wrote that females of _spinifer_ attain \"an extreme length of\r\nfrom twenty-four to twenty-eight, and, in rare instances, thirty\r\ninches, with an average length of carapace of fifteen to eighteen,\"\r\nand True (1893:152) mentioned lengths of two feet or even more.\r\nTurtles 17 to 18 inches long are doubtless rare and probably about 60\r\nyears old. A specimen of _ferox_ lived the longest time in\r\ncaptivity--25 years (Pope, 1949:304). Individuals of _ferox_ probably\r\nexceed the maximum recorded length of carapace of 18-1/2 inches\r\n(Agassiz, 1857:401). The head of a _ferox_ having a width of 3-1/2\r\ninches (Wright and Funkhouser, 1915:120) corresponds to a length of\r\ncarapace of approximately 22-1/2 inches (PL/HW == 4.9; CL/PL == 1.3).\r\nDe Sola and Abrams (1933:12) wrote that _ferox_ in the Okefinokee\r\nSwamp, Georgia, attains a length of two feet. The largest female of\r\n_muticus_ of which I have record is 21.5 centimeters in plastral\r\nlength (KU 2308), a measurement corresponding to a carapace about 13\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\n\r\nMortality\r\n\r\nMan, in one sense or another, is a great enemy of soft-shelled\r\nturtles. Those caught by fishermen are destroyed because of the\r\nerroneous belief that they are harmful to fish populations. Some are\r\ndrowned in hoop-nets or gill nets used by commercial fishermen. Many\r\nsoftshells are used by man for food. Herald (1949:118-19) reported the\r\nresults of spraying an area with DDT and mentioned a 10-inch\r\nindividual of _ferox_ that was eating a dead bluegill, and which\r\n\"probably died as a result of ingesting contaminated food.\"\r\n\r\nPredation on eggs probably accounts for most mortality. Hamilton\r\n(1947:209) reported tracks of spotted skunks, raccoons and foxes seen\r\nabout destroyed nests, and Cahn (1937:183) incriminated skunks and\r\nraccoons. Goldsmith (1945:449) reported a raccoon that unearthed seven\r\nnests in one night. Little and Keller (1937:221) wrote of egg shells\r\nfound in the sand (probably not as a result of hatching), and Muller\r\n(1921:182) reported egg shells around dug-up nests, suggesting such\r\npredators as \"ground moles,\" raccoons and crows. Chesser (_in_ Harper,\r\n1926:416) said that in the Okefinokee Swamp the jackdaw (fish crow),\r\nraccoon, bear and domestic dogs will eat the eggs. Wright and\r\nFunkhouser (1915:122) recorded a young _ferox_ in the stomach of a\r\nwater moccasin (_Agkistrodon piscivorus_), and suggested that young\r\nsoft-shells probably are food of larger snakes. Kellogg (1929:26)\r\nwrote that stomachs of two alligators each contained one soft-shelled\r\nturtle. Newman (1906:136) found that young captives were eaten by\r\nindividuals of _Chrysemys_ and _Sternothaerus_, and I found that they\r\nwere eaten by _Kinosternon_. Mitsukuri (1905:261-62) stated that\r\nfirst- and second-year individuals of _T. sinensis_ are eaten by the\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nBreckenridge (1960) wrote that a clutch of eggs probably failed to\r\ndevelop because of an \"... unusually cool season.\" Evermann and Clark\r\n(1920:595) stated that \"many young appear to perish during the first\r\nwinter.\" They (_op. cit._:594) found two eggs submerged in two feet of\r\nwater and it is supposed that they never hatched. Dundee (1950:139)\r\nreported remains of soft-shelled turtles left on the mud of a dried\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nParasites\r\n\r\nMuller (1921:182) found maggots in a few eggs of a clutch, but thought\r\nthat only the infertile and decomposing eggs were infested. I removed\r\na hard, spherical cyst from the hind leg of a preserved softshell\r\n(TU). A captive hatchling (TU 17304) died as the result of a\r\ncontinuously enlarging and deepening hole on the top of its head; I\r\ncould not discern a visible parasite with the naked eye. I found 25\r\nleeches (_Placobdella parasitica_, largest about 13 mm.; identified by\r\nDr. Kenneth B. Armitage, Department of Zoology, University of Kansas)\r\nin association with 11 _T. m. muticus_ (number per turtle not known)\r\nthat were collected from the Kansas River at Lawrence, Douglas County,\r\nKansas. Evermann and Clark (1920:596) reported a few nematodes in the\r\nstomachs of some _spinifer_, and three nematodes are listed by Harwood\r\n(1932:46, 60, 62, 66) in the same species. Hughes, Higginbotham and\r\nClary (1941) have listed the known reptilian hosts of parasitic\r\ntrematodes, and Hughes, Baker and Dawson (1941) have done the same for\r\ntapeworms. The species of parasites and their trionychid hosts are\r\nlisted below.\r\n\r\n                                   TREMATODA\r\n  _Trionyx ferox_:     _Neopolystoma orbiculare_     _Vasotrema amydae_\r\n                       _Neopolystoma rugosa_         _Vasotrema attenuatum_\r\n                       _Polystomoides coronatus_     _Vasotrema robustum_\r\n                       _Teloporia aspidonectes_\r\n\r\n  _Trionyx muticus_:   _Crepidostomum cooperi_       _Opisthorchis ovalis_\r\n\r\n  _Trionyx spinifer_:  _Hapalorhynchus evaginatus_   _Vasotrema amydae_\r\n                       _Opisthorchis ovalis_         _Vasotrema attenuatum_\r\n                       _Polystomoides coronatus_     _Vasotrema longitestis_\r\n                       _Teloporia aspidonectes_      _Vasotrema robustum_\r\n\r\n                                    CESTODA\r\n  _Trionyx ferox_:     _Proteocephalus trionychinus_\r\n\r\n  _Trionyx spinifer_:  _Proteocephalus testudo_\r\n\r\n                                   NEMATODA\r\n  _Trionyx spinifer_:  _Camallanus trispinosus_      _Spiroxys amydae_\r\n                       _Falcaustra chelydrae_\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Importance\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have mentioned softshells as a food item much sought\r\nafter by man. The commercial value of these turtles has been\r\nsummarized by Clark and Southall (1920:15-16). Softshells are consumed\r\nin quantity only in small towns near the place of capture. They are\r\nfound only occasionally in the markets of large cities because the\r\nturtles are little known and the palatability of their flesh is\r\nunappreciated. Also, they do not stand shipment so well as other\r\nturtles, and they are \"not so meaty as the snapper; so there is more\r\nwaste\" (Clark and Southall, _loc. cit._). Little and Keller (1937:221)\r\nreported living individuals for sale at the market in Ciudad Juarez,\r\nChihuahua; however my inquiry at markets in Juarez in the summer of\r\n1959 disclosed no evidence of recent sale of soft-shelled turtles. In\r\nthe southeastern United States the demand is perhaps greater than in\r\nother regions. I have noted softshells in the market at New Orleans,\r\nand Oliver (1955:19) has mentioned the sale of \"some 146,600 pounds\"\r\nin one recent year in Florida. Over most of their range, however,\r\nthere probably is no general demand for softshells and no special\r\nefforts are made to capture them. Softshells have been raised\r\nsuccessfully on \"turtle farms\" in Japan (Mitsukuri, 1905). True\r\n(1893:152) wrote that \"The eggs also are considered very excellent.\"\r\n\r\nSoftshells generally are condemned by fishermen because of the\r\nmistaken belief that they are detrimental to fish populations. Food of\r\nsoftshells is principally crawfish and insects. Fish comprise a small\r\nproportion of the diet (frequency 1.9% in Michigan, Lagler, 1943: Tab.\r\n9). Most of the fishes eaten seem to be small minnows. Probably fish\r\nwould comprise a larger percentage of the diet if they could be\r\ncaught. I doubt that a softshell can pursue and capture a healthy fish\r\nin natural waters. Recently dead fish are eaten and perhaps fish eggs,\r\nand senile and decrepit fishes. There is no evidence that soft-shelled\r\nturtles are active predators on any kind of fish. Of course in\r\ncongested areas such as ponds of fish hatcheries, it is desirable to\r\neliminate the turtles. The known food habits of soft-shelled turtles\r\nsuggest that they compete with game fishes for food, but there is no\r\ninformation on the intensity of competition (Lagler, _op. cit._:305).\r\n\r\nThe combined statements of many authors in their general accounts of\r\nfood habits (for instance, Babcock, 1919:425) have tended to create\r\nthe erroneous belief that soft-shelled turtles harm waterfowl. To my\r\nknowledge the only basis for this belief is the statement of Wright\r\nand Funkhouser (1915:123) that according to the natives of the\r\nOkefinokee Swamp, the larger turtles \"devour also such waterfowl as\r\nare unfortunate enough to be taken unaware by these reptiles.\" Perhaps\r\nan occasional waterfowl is eaten, but the present information on kinds\r\nof food eaten certainly does not warrant the destruction of\r\nsoft-shelled turtles. There may be some mortality in congested areas\r\nsuch as game refuges where young birds crowd the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe kind of bait successfully used in trapping softshell turtles\r\nsuggests that they are of some value as scavengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTIONARY HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to reconstruct the history of soft-shelled turtles\r\nin North America, it will be helpful to summarize the salient facts\r\nconcerning the distribution and relationships of the living forms, and\r\nto comment on fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nThe geographic range of the family Trionychidae in North America is\r\nprincipally in the eastern two-thirds of the continent and contributes\r\nto the well-known floral and faunal resemblance of eastern North\r\nAmerica to that of eastern Asia (Schmidt, 1946:149) because _Trionyx\r\nferox_ (see Fig. 18) resembles the species of the genus in Asia more\r\nclosely than it does any North American species. The Recent\r\ndistribution in America does not include the Neotropical region,\r\nwhereas the geographical range in the Old World extends south of the\r\nequator (Fig. 1; Dunn, 1931:109, fig. 2; Gadow, 1909:333, fig. 72;\r\nHay, 1908:35, fig. 16).\r\n\r\nAmerican softshells occur in all river systems in the United States\r\nand the two adjacent river systems on the east coast of México that\r\ndrain into the Gulf of México. Softshells inhabit streams of the Great\r\nPlains and occur westward to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in\r\nthe western tributaries of the Mississippi River. Only _T. s.\r\nspinifer_ occurs in the southern part of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence\r\ndrainage. Softshells are absent from the Atlantic Coast drainage\r\nexcept the Hudson River and those rivers at least south of (and\r\nincluding) the Pee Dee River in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n_T. s. emoryi_ is not known to be indigenous west of the Río Grande\r\ndrainage, and has probably been introduced across the Continental\r\nDivide via the Gila River in western New Mexico into the Colorado\r\nRiver drainage of Arizona (Miller, 1946:46); the species undoubtedly\r\noccurs in México on the Sonoran side of the Colorado River opposite\r\nBaja California (Bogert and Oliver, 1945:417).\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1959, I trapped turtles and with a specimen in hand\r\ninquired about softshells occurring in the inland drainages of\r\nnorthern México. From two collecting stations on the Río Nazas in\r\nDurango, only specimens of _Pseudemys_ and _Kinosternon_ were\r\nobtained; local inhabitants had neither seen nor heard of softshells.\r\nFlooded conditions in August of 1959 permitted trapping in only one of\r\nthe inland drainages of northwestern Chihuahua, the Río Santa María;\r\nonly specimens of _Kinosternon_ were obtained. Local residents near\r\nthat river as well as those living near the Río Casa Grandes and Río\r\ndel Carmen had not seen or heard of softshells. A person that I judge\r\nto be a competent observer reported seeing a softshell in June of 1958\r\nin the Río Alamos (Arroyo Cuchujáqui) near Alamos, Sonora, in the Río\r\ndel Fuerte drainage on the west coast of México. I was a member of a\r\nfield party from the University of Kansas that visited that locality\r\nin late January of 1959; only specimens of _Pseudemys_ and\r\n_Kinosternon_ were collected. Possibly isolated populations occur in\r\nstreams of the Pacific Coast drainage of northern México. If so, they\r\nmay have entered Pacific Coast drainages by stream capture across the\r\nContinental Divide. Several species of fish that are characteristic of\r\nthe Río Grande traversed the Sierra Madre Occidental at some former\r\ntime (presumably via the Río Conchos and Río Papigochic) and occur in\r\nthe Yáqui River drainage (Meek, 1904:xxxviii, xlvii; Miller,\r\n1959:214-15, 217). Because of the probability that the Río Nazas at\r\nsome former time flowed north into the Río Grande (Meek, _op.\r\ncit._:xxxiv), it is notable that softshells are absent in the Río\r\nNazas drainage; the Big Bend turtle, _Pseudemys scripta gaigeae_,\r\noccurs in both drainages.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationships\r\n\r\nCharacters of _Trionyx ferox_ suggesting a closer resemblance to some\r\nOld World members of the family than to the other three American species\r\nare: large size; marked difference between juvenal and adult patterns on\r\nthe carapace; the marginal ridge; and the longitudinal ridgelike\r\nprominences on the carapace, especially in juveniles. Other characters\r\nof _ferox_ suggesting a corresponding, but less marked resemblance to\r\nOld World species of _Trionyx_ are: the large size of the eighth pair of\r\npleurals; the absence of callosities on the epiplastron and preplastra;\r\nfrequent fusion of the hyoplastra and hypoplastra (more than in\r\n_spinifer_ or _muticus_); and tolerance of marine waters (more than\r\n_muticus_ or _spinifer_). Some fossils also suggest alliance with\r\n_ferox_ and some Old World members of the genus in their large size,\r\nlarge eighth pair of pleurals, and occurrence in marine deposits;\r\nseveral Old World species have been reported at sea (_Pelochelys_, _T.\r\ntriunguis_, _T. sinensis_). _T. ferox_ is monotypic and has the most\r\nsoutheasterly displaced, geographic range.\r\n\r\nBecause _ferox_ resembles softshells from the Old World more closely\r\nthan it does any American species, _ferox_ is assumed to be more closely\r\nrelated to Old World softshells than to any American species, and,\r\nbecause of resemblance to some fossils, _ferox_ is assumed to resemble\r\nmost closely the primitive, ancestral stock of softshells that occupied\r\nNorth America. _T. spinifer_, _T. muticus_ and _T. ater_, which resemble\r\neach other more closely than any of them resembles _T. ferox_ or any Old\r\nWorld species, are considered autochthonous in North America. _T.\r\nspinifer_ and _T. muticus_ are distinct, sympatric species. Burt\r\n(1935:321) suggested that the two species \"may be variants of the same\r\nspecies.\" _T. ater_ is weakly differentiated from _T. spinifer emoryi_.\r\nThe species, _ferox_, _spinifer_ and _muticus_ are well-differentiated\r\nand were considered by Agassiz (1857), Gray (1869) and Baur (1893) as\r\nbelonging to three different genera.\r\n\r\nIn the widely distributed _T. spinifer_, the subspecies _spinifer_,\r\n_hartwegi_ and _asper_ closely resemble one another; _asper_ seems most\r\ndistinct, whereas _spinifer_ and _hartwegi_ are terminal populations of\r\nan east-west cline in one character. The subspecies _pallidus_,\r\n_guadalupensis_ and _emoryi_ resemble one another more closely than any\r\nresembles any of the subspecies mentioned immediately above; _T. s.\r\npallidus_, however, is annectent. _T. s. pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_\r\nrepresent terminal populations of clines in several characters, some of\r\nwhich occur in _emoryi_, but that subspecies is more distinct from\r\n_pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_ than those subspecies are from each\r\nother. _T. s. emoryi_ is the most variable subspecies. _T. ater_, known\r\nonly from a restricted area in central Coahuila, is most closely related\r\nto _T. s. emoryi_, and possesses some characters judged to represent the\r\nattenuation of the geographic cline in _pallidus_, _guadalupensis_ and\r\n_emoryi_ mentioned above. Some characters of _ater_ show alliance to the\r\nspecies _muticus_. Of _T. muticus_, whose geographic range is removed\r\nfrom that of _ater_, there are two subspecies. Four subspecies of\r\n_spinifer_ (_spinifer_, _hartwegi_, _pallidus_ and _asper_) intergrade\r\nin the Mississippi River drainage of Louisiana; few specimens, however,\r\nare typical of _asper_. The subspecies of _muticus_ do not show definite\r\nevidence of intergradation. To facilitate quick reference, the\r\noccurrence of some characters that are shared by, or are approximated\r\nin, two or more forms are listed in Table 10. In addition to external\r\ncharacters, some ratios emphasize the clinal relationship between _T. s.\r\npallidus_, _guadalupensis_, and _emoryi_ mentioned above. Of especial\r\ninterest is the frequent resemblance of those subspecies and _T. ater_\r\nto _T. ferox_ (dorsal pattern on limbs of adults, reduction in anterior\r\ntuberculation, wide head, narrow carapace, and short snout), and the\r\nless marked resemblance of _T. muticus_ to _T. ferox_; not shown in\r\nTable 10 is the resemblance of _ferox_ to _T. muticus calvatus_ in\r\nhaving thick, black-bordered postocular stripes. Some populations of _T.\r\ns. emoryi_ resemble _T. muticus_ in the corresponding size at sexual\r\nmaturity and in having well-developed plastral callosities. It is\r\nnotable that the occurrence of _ater_, and to a lesser extent that of\r\n_T. s. emoryi_, which resembles _ferox_ (and _muticus_), is in the\r\nsouthwestern United States and northern México.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 10.

the principal difference in the former and present distributions\r\nis the lack of living softshells in Europe.\r\n\r\nI have not studied in detail the many fossil remains but such\r\nexamination as I have made of them suggests that many of the characters\r\nused as a basis for distinguishing fossil forms in North America are\r\nsubject to individual variation or are of no diagnostic value in the\r\nliving species (Hummel, 1929:769). Knowledge of the variation in the\r\nliving species of the Old World would aid in adequately appraising the\r\nNorth American fossils. Some osteological characters of the three living\r\nAmerican species (excluding _ater_) together with data on variation\r\nwithin a given species are mentioned below. Some differences in skulls\r\nof the three species already were mentioned in the section \"Osteological\r\nCharacters.\" Because most fossil remains are those of the carapace and\r\nplastron, attention is here given to those structures.\r\n\r\n_Widened alveolar surfaces of jaws._--An ontogenetic variation\r\naffecting large skulls of _T. ferox_ and some individuals of _T.\r\nspinifer asper_; presumably confined to females. Of especial interest\r\nis its presence in some populations of _asper_ that are not otherwise\r\ndistinguishable (external characters) from the rest of the individuals\r\ncomprising that subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Sculpturing._--No differences in pattern (generally of anastomosing\r\nridges) on carapace or plastron; fineness or coarseness seemingly\r\ncorrelated with size; frequency and kind (knoblike or ridgelike) of\r\nbony prominences on carapace variable; bony prominences confined to\r\nspecies _spinifer_ and _ferox_, occurring principally on large\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n_Fontanelles of carapace._--Closure more or less correlated with\r\nincreasing size, although much variation noted between individuals of\r\nsame size; small individuals have fontanelles confluent (medially),\r\nthus separating nuchal from contact with first neural and first pair\r\nof pleurals.\r\n\r\n_Number and arrangement of neurals and pleurals._--Neurals number six\r\nto nine, usually seven or eight; pleurals number seven or eight pairs,\r\nand may or may not be in contact with each other posteriorly; eighth\r\npair of pleurals when present reduced, never contacting seventh\r\nneural; arrangement posteriorly variable (see Fig. 16 and Tab. 5).\r\n\r\n_Plastral callosities._--Increase in size with advancing age causing\r\ncorresponding reduction in size of plastral vacuity; relatively best\r\ndeveloped in _muticus_ (all elements touching medially on KU 41380\r\nleaving no plastral vacuity); probably no callosities on preplastra or\r\nepiplastron of _ferox_; callosity on epiplastron of _spinifer_ not\r\ncovering entire surface (as it may in _muticus_).\r\n\r\n_Epiplastron._--Obtusely-angled (greater than 90 degrees) in\r\n_muticus_; acutely-angled (90 degrees or less) in _ferox_ and\r\n_spinifer_.\r\n\r\n_Hyo-hypoplastral suture._--Usually present, but occasionally absent,\r\nin all species.\r\n\r\nThe fossil turtles of North America have been treated monographically by\r\nHay (1908), who apportioned fossil trionychid remains into eight genera\r\n(three living) of two families. Recently, Romer (1956:514) relegated all\r\ntrionychid fossils to the genus _Trionyx_. Characters, as gleaned from\r\nHay's synopsis (_op. cit._:465-548, Pls. 85-113), that seem especially\r\nworthy of taxonomic consideration are: (1) The presence of a preneural,\r\nwhich is not known to occur in the living American species (seemingly\r\nthe preneural is fused with the first neural and represents the elongate\r\nfirst neural in living species); (2) The large eighth pair of pleurals,\r\nespecially when they contact the seventh neural; (3) The thickness of\r\nthe costal plates, a condition probably correlated with the size of some\r\nfossils, which are larger than any living species (for example, Hay,\r\n_op. cit._:518, mentioned the greatest dimension of a nuchal bone as\r\napproximately 300 mm.).\r\n\r\nThe approximate extent of the known horizontal distribution of fossils\r\nis indicated in Figure 24. A comparison of known localities of fossils\r\nand the distribution of living softshells (introduced population of _T.\r\ns. emoryi_ in Colorado River drainage omitted) shows that the\r\ndistribution was more widespread in former times. Localities of fossils\r\nare centered on the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to North Carolina and\r\nin the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains region from Alberta and Saskatchewan\r\nto northwestern New Mexico; the oldest fossils, which occur in each\r\nregion, are found in Upper Cretaceous deposits. Many fossils occur in\r\nmarine and brackish water deposits. Most localities depicted on the map\r\nare mentioned by Hay (1908:36-37, 465-548). Other localities included on\r\nthe map are in southern Alberta (Russell, 1929:164; 1930:27; Sternberg,\r\n1926:104), southern Saskatchewan (Russell, 1934:109), northern South\r\nDakota (Hay, 1910:324), central Utah (Gilmore, 1946), western Colorado\r\n(Schmidt, 1945), southwestern Kansas (Galbreath, 1948:284), southeastern\r\nTexas (Hay _in_ Stejneger, 1944:65), southern California (Brattstrom,\r\n1958:5), and northeastern Coahuila, México (Mullerried, 1943:623). Hay's\r\nrecord of the living _Platypeltis_ (= _Trionyx_) _ferox_ and other\r\nremains from the Peace Creek formation in Hillsborough County, Florida\r\n(_op. cit._:548), presumably is the same record mentioned by Pope\r\n(1949:305).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 24. Geographic distribution of Recent\r\n      soft-shelled turtles (bordered by heavy black line) and fossil\r\n      trionychids (black circles) in North America. The introduced\r\n      population of _T. s. emoryi_ in the southwestern United States\r\n      is not shown.]\r\n\r\nAmeghino (_in_ Hay, _op. cit._:35) recorded specimens of a trionychid\r\nfrom the Cretaceous of Patagonia, a record that, at present, cannot be\r\naccepted (Simpson, 1943:423). Mullerried (_loc. cit._) also mentioned\r\nsome trionychid remains that were housed in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas,\r\nMéxico, (material now lost), but their geographical provenance was\r\nunknown. The former extent of range southward is not known; it is\r\nimprobable that trionychids occurred in South America (Simpson,\r\n1943:423).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhylogeny\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of _T. ferox_ in Florida and the suggestion of\r\n_ferox_-like characters in turtles from southwestern Texas and northern\r\nMexico presents a distributional pattern that resembles the disjunct\r\nranges of many other pairs of closely related taxa. The clear-water\r\nponds in central Coahuila, which are inhabited by _ater_, correspond to\r\naquatic habitats supporting _ferox_ in Florida. The splitting of the\r\ngeographic range into eastern and western parts possibly resulted from a\r\nsouthward shift of colder climates in glacial stages of the Pleistocene,\r\nor from the development of an intervening arid region in the late\r\nMiocene and Pliocene (see discussions in Martin and Harrell, 1957, and\r\nBlair, 1959). An initial separation of range by an arid environment in\r\nthe Pliocene may have been terminated by the colder climates in the\r\nPleistocene.\r\n\r\nThe degree of morphological difference between _ferox_ and the forms in\r\nsouthwestern Texas and northern México, suggests that the time of\r\nseparation antedated the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nTrionychid turtles may have traversed the Bering land bridge between\r\nAsia and North America in late Mesozoic times for they occur as fossils\r\non the Atlantic Coast and in the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains region in\r\nUpper Cretaceous deposits. Shallow, inland seas may have afforded no\r\nbarrier to the dispersal of softshells which presumably were tolerant of\r\nsaline waters. The orogeny and volcanic action with subsequent erosion\r\nand sedimentation of the Rocky Mountain system, which was later\r\naccompanied by drier climates, tended to obliterate suitable habitats in\r\nthe western United States; softshells persisted at least until the Upper\r\nEocene on the west coast (Brattstrom, 1958:5). The factors responsible\r\nfor the disappearance of softshells on the Atlantic Coast probably were\r\nrelated to the glacial advances in the Pleistocene; the most recent\r\nfossils known occur in Miocene deposits.\r\n\r\nThe relationships of the living species and subspecies were probably\r\ncorrelated with geologic change in aquatic environments and drainage\r\npatterns. These changes probably included stream capture, flooding,\r\ndrought, uplifting and planation. A hypothetical, evolutionary history\r\nis presented in the phylogenetic diagram where letter symbols represent\r\nspecies and subspecies, and grouped symbols (referred to in subsequent\r\nparagraphs) represent ancestral stocks.\r\n\r\n     Pliocene               Pleistocene              Recent\r\n  ==========================================================================\r\n\r\n       +--F-----------------------------------F  (_ferox_)\r\n       |\r\n       |                            +---------Mm (_muticus muticus_)\r\n       |      +--M------------------+\r\n       |      |                     +---------Mc (_muticus calvatus_)\r\n       |      |\r\n  FMSA-+      |                            +--Ss (_spinifer spinifer_)\r\n       |      |                     +------+\r\n       |      |                     |      +--Sh (_spinifer hartwegi_)\r\n       |      |             +--Ssha-+\r\n       +--MSA-+             |       |\r\n              |             |       +---------Sa (_spinifer asper_)\r\n              |             |\r\n              |      +--S---+              +--Sp (_spinifer pallidus_)\r\n              |      |      |       +--Spg-+\r\n              |      |      |       |      +--Sg (_spinifer guadalupensis_)\r\n              +--SA--+      +--Sepg-+\r\n                     |              |\r\n                     |              +--Se-----Se (_spinifer emoryi_)\r\n                     |\r\n                     +--A---------------------A  (_ater_)\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAn arid environment in the central and southern United States and\r\nnorthern Mexico may have increased in area especially southward from\r\nMiocene times into the Pliocene (Dorf, 1959:189, 191). The combination\r\nof physiographic changes and aridity, which modified the mesic,\r\nessentially continuous, aquatic habitats, may have isolated and aided in\r\nthe differentiation of the _ferox_, _muticus_ and _spinifer_ stocks.\r\nEncroachment of the Eocene seas, the maximal extent of which\r\ncorresponded to the Gulf Coastal Plain and included a northerly\r\nextension as far as Cairo in southern Illinois (Mississippi embayment),\r\npossibly was an initial barrier isolating the _ferox_ stock of the east.\r\n\r\nIn the late Miocene or early Pliocene, the MSA (_muticus-spinifer-ater_)\r\nstock presumably occupied a large region of the central United States,\r\nwhich extended southward into northern México and along the Gulf Coast\r\nat least as far as Alabama. Farther eastward, the _ferox_ stock was\r\nisolated in more mesic, probably swampy, marshy habitats.\r\n\r\nLater, in the southwestern part of the range of the MSA stock (southern\r\nTexas and northern México), the SA and _muticus_ stocks were separated.\r\nThe _muticus_ stock occurred to the northeastward, and presumably no\r\nfarther south than the area included within the present drainage basin\r\nof the Colorado River. Southward, the SA stock was isolated into several\r\npopulations that are today represented by _ater_ and _T. s. emoryi_, the\r\nmost variable subspecies; the distribution of the most distinctive\r\npopulation of _emoryi_ indicates a former isolated inland drainage. The\r\nmultiple fragmentation of the SA stock presumably terminated by the end\r\nof the Pliocene. The progenitors of _T. ater_ probably closely resembled\r\n_ferox_. _Trionyx ater_ and _T. ferox_ resemble each other\r\nmorphologically and in habitat. Therefore, the progenitors of _ater_ are\r\nconsidered to have undergone comparatively little differentiation.\r\n\r\nThe _spinifer_ stock, occurring principally in the area included within\r\nthe present drainage basin of the Río Grande, extended its geographic\r\nrange eastward and became sympatric with _muticus_ and _ferox_. An\r\nexpansion of range necessarily demands more mesic conditions; these were\r\nperhaps afforded by the pluvials (wet, rainy ages) that were coincident\r\nwith the glacial periods in the Pleistocene (Antevs, 1948:168). The\r\npluvials permitted the isolated populations of the _spinifer_ stock to\r\nunite, and permitted that stock to extend its range eastward. The\r\nconcurrent continental glaciation permitted the _spinifer_ stock to\r\nextend its range eastward only in a belt approximately 300 miles wide\r\nalong the Gulf Coast, and also displaced the ranges of _ferox_ and\r\n_muticus_ to southern latitudes. Perhaps _ferox_ was less tolerant of\r\ndecreased temperatures or changes in habitat than was the _spinifer_\r\nstock but, for some unknown reason, _ferox_ did not extend its range\r\nwestward. Because _T. ater_ closely resembles _T. s. emoryi_, continued\r\nisolation of _ater_ since the beginning of the Pleistocene seems\r\nunlikely and _ater_ may have been reunited in subsequent pluvial periods\r\nwith the _spinifer_ (_emoryi_) stock. A climatic fluctuation between\r\nrelatively wet and dry periods is corroborated by studies of soil\r\nprofiles in Trans-Pecos Texas (Bryan and Albritton, 1943).\r\n\r\nThe separation of the range of _spinifer_ in the general region of\r\nwestern Louisiana, resulting in the differentiation of the _spinifer_\r\ngroup of subspecies to the east and the _emoryi_ group of subspecies to\r\nthe west, and the differentiation of _T. s. asper_ and _T. m. calvatus_,\r\nboth having corresponding western limits of distribution (Mississippi\r\nRiver drainage), are associated with the activities of the Mississippi\r\nRiver and its flood-plain. The combined effects of the pluvials and\r\ninterpluvials seem responsible for changes in the lower Mississippi\r\nValley. Great volumes of summer melt-water in the glacial stages greatly\r\nincreased the breadth of the channel of the lower Mississippi River\r\n(corresponding to the northern extent of the Mississippi embayment;\r\nHobbs, 1950), and this, coupled with the encroachment of Pleistocene\r\nseas (especially in the Mississippi embayment) in the interglacial\r\nperiods, perhaps separated populations eastward represented today by _T.\r\nm. calvatus_ and _T. s. asper_. The _spinifer-hartwegi_ stock probably\r\ndeveloped in southern Louisiana in association with the meandering of\r\nthe Mississippi River and its tributaries, and its broad alluvial plain.\r\nThe biota of that plain differed from that adjacent to the east or west\r\n(see discussion in Viosca, 1944) and constituted a barrier, of a sort,\r\nto free communication between the east and west. Westward the _emoryi_\r\ngroup of subspecies differentiated, its eastern limit probably being the\r\nRed River, which followed its own course to the Gulf along the lowlands\r\non the west side of the Mississippi Valley and did not empty directly\r\ninto the Mississippi until Recent times (Holland, 1944:20). There was\r\nnot an equally-marked, corresponding separation of the range of\r\n_muticus_. However, the juvenal pattern of the subspecies _muticus_ that\r\ninhabits the Gulf Coast streams is slightly different (having less short\r\nlines) from that of _muticus_ elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Río Grande (inhabited by _emoryi_) presumably had its own exit to\r\nthe Gulf whereas rivers westward to (and including) the Red River\r\n(inhabited by _pallidus-guadalupensis_ cline) probably were joined near\r\ntheir mouths forming a large drainage system. Hubbs (1957:93) pointed\r\nout that the Río Grande-Nueces divide also limits a large number of\r\nspecies of fish. The differentiation of _pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_\r\nis possibly due to a difference in the salt content of waters that drain\r\nthe Edward's Plateau (see page 547), or to isolation of those subspecies\r\nin separate drainage systems that had their own exits to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Mississippi drainage, the _spinifer-hartwegi_ stock\r\nextended its range northward following the retreat of the last glacial\r\nstage, and differentiated into those two subspecies in the upper\r\nMississippi drainage and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence drainage system.\r\n\r\nI have seen one specimen (UMMZ 59198) from the eastern part of the\r\nTennessee drainage (inhabited by _T. s. spinifer_) that resembles _T. s.\r\nasper_ (occupying the Gulf Coast drainages of the southeast). This\r\nresemblance tends to support the thesis of a former confluence of the\r\nCoosa (Alabama River system) and Tennessee drainages as believed by some\r\nmalacologists to explain resemblances in molluscan fauna and as\r\ncorroborated by physiographical evidence (see discussion in van der\r\nSchalie, 1945).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Importance of the Study of Turtle Populations in Relation to the\r\nHistory of River Systems\r\n\r\nIn the Río Grande drainage the geographic distribution of the population\r\nof _emoryi_ having orange color in males is approximately the same as\r\nthat of _Pseudemys scripta gaigeae_; the corresponding distributions\r\nsuggest that a part of the Río Grande drainage consisting of the Río\r\nConchos in Chihuahua and the Big Bend region of Texas was isolated in\r\nformer times. Accordingly, the known aquatic chelonian fauna in the\r\nbasin of Cuatro Ciénegas in central Coahuila, México, is endemic (except\r\n_T. s. emoryi_). And the coincidence of the geographic ranges of _T.\r\nmuticus calvatus_ and _Graptemys pulchra_ in the southeast suggest a\r\nformer association of the included (Pearl to Escambia) river systems.\r\nThe occurrence of _T. s. pallidus_ in the Red River drainage indicates\r\nthat the Red River was formerly associated with the Gulf Coast streams\r\nof eastern Texas and western Louisiana (inhabited by _pallidus_) and not\r\nwith the Mississippi River drainage. The lower Mississippi River valley\r\nforms a prominent barrier to the eastern and western dispersal of many\r\nkinds of species and subspecies of turtles. _T. m. calvatus_ and _T. s.\r\nasper_, which occur in rivers of the Gulf Coast drainage east of the\r\nMississippi, are well-differentiated subspecies showing little or no\r\nevidence of intergradation with their relatives in the Mississippi\r\nRiver. The large faunal break provided by the Mississippi River would\r\nseem to indicate greater age for that river than for other rivers of the\r\nGulf Coast drainage.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the distributions of _Trionyx_ and _Graptemys_ in Texas\r\nsuggests a faunal break between the drainage systems of the Brazos and\r\nColorado rivers. _Graptemys versa_ occurs in the Colorado and\r\nGuadalupe-San Antonio drainages. To my knowledge _versa_ hitherto has\r\nnot been recorded from the latter drainage system. I have seen one\r\nspecimen of _Graptemys_ (custody of Gerald Raun, University of Texas)\r\nfrom the Guadalupe River drainage, which I judge to be representative of\r\n_versa_, and Olson (1959:48) has reported _Graptemys_ (probably _versa_)\r\nin the San Antonio River. The distribution of _G. versa_ parallels in a\r\ngeneral way, the distribution of _T. s. guadalupensis_. _G. kohni_ and\r\n_T. s. pallidus_ occur in the Brazos River and eastward. Also, it is\r\nnotable that the population of _T. m. muticus_ occurring in the Colorado\r\nRiver drainage differs slightly (more black pigmentation) from the same\r\nsubspecies in the adjacent Brazos River system.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference in the patterns of distribution and degree of\r\ndifferentiation of different genera of aquatic turtles in the eastern\r\nUnited States. Tinkle (1958:41-43, Figs. 49-55) concluded that a general\r\nresemblance in the patterns of distribution of the different genera of\r\nturtles was evidence that the rates of evolution were essentially the\r\nsame, assuming that each genus had had a similar time interval for\r\ndifferentiation (_op. cit._:42). If this is true, corresponding patterns\r\nof distribution might indicate the same relative age of the population\r\nof turtles concerned. Generally, the genera of turtles that on\r\nmorphological grounds are considered the oldest and most primitive\r\n(_Macroclemys_, _Chelydra_) show less differentiation into species and\r\nsubspecies than those considered younger and more recently evolved\r\n(_Graptemys_, _Pseudemys_). In the genus _Graptemys_, much\r\ndifferentiation occurs in the geologically, recently formed, Gulf Coast\r\ndrainage systems of the southeastern United States. It would seem then,\r\nthat faster rates of differentiation denote more recent genera, whereas\r\nolder genera are endowed with a \"genetic senility\" and are less subject\r\nto change.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the relative age of two genera of turtles, as suggested by\r\ntheir degree of differentiation into minor taxa, and the degree of\r\ndifference between populations of two genera that inhabit adjacent\r\ndrainage systems, may indicate the relative ages of particular river\r\nsystems. For example, the slight resemblance of _G. versa_ to _kohni_\r\nand the close resemblance of _T. s. guadalupensis_ to _pallidus_ in\r\nTexas may reflect the age of the genus _Trionyx_ and the youth of the\r\ngenus _Graptemys_. Remembering that the genus _Graptemys_ is relatively\r\nrecently evolved and assuming _G. versa_ to be the most primitive and\r\nancestral species of the genus (at least it is monotypic, the most\r\naberrant species, and unlike any other species of the genus), it seems\r\nlogical to suppose that the physiographic changes responsible for the\r\nColorado-Brazos divide and the isolation of _versa_ occurred early in\r\nthe evolutionary history of the genus _Graptemys_. The degree of\r\ndifferentiation of _Trionyx_ suggests that that genus is, comparatively,\r\nmuch older, and that the same physiographic changes responsible for the\r\nColorado-Brazos divide and differentiation of the subspecies _pallidus_\r\nand _guadalupensis_ occurred late in the evolutionary history of the\r\ngenus _Trionyx_.\r\n\r\nIn general, patterns of distribution of turtle populations support\r\nphysiographic evidence concerning changes in stream confluence and\r\nrelative age of river systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn North America, soft-shelled turtles (genus _Trionyx_) occur in\r\nnorthern México, the eastern two-thirds of the United States, and\r\nextreme southeastern Canada. The genus fits the well-known Sino-American\r\ndistributional pattern. In North America there are four species. Three\r\n(_ferox_, _spinifer_ and _muticus_) are well-differentiated and one\r\n(_ater_) is not well-differentiated from _spinifer_. Characters of\r\ntaxonomic worth are provided by the following: size; proportions of\r\nsnout, head and shell; pattern on carapace, snout, side of head, and\r\nlimbs; tuberculation; sizes of parts of skull; number of parts of\r\ncarapaces; and, shape and number of some parts of plastra. Many features\r\nshow geographical gradients or clines. _T. ferox_ is the largest species\r\nand _muticus_ is the smallest. Females of all species are larger than\r\nmales. With increasing size of individual, the juvenal pattern is\r\nreplaced by a mottled and blotched pattern in females of all species;\r\nadult males of _spinifer_ retain a conspicuous juvenal pattern, whereas\r\nthe juvenal pattern is sometimes obscured or lost on those of _ferox_\r\nand _muticus_. The elongation of the preanal region in all males, and\r\nthe acquisition of a \"sandpapery\" carapace in males of _spinifer_ occur\r\nat sexual maturity. There is a marked secondary sexual difference in\r\ncoloration in a population of _T. s. emoryi_ (side of head bright orange\r\nin males and yellow in females). The sex of many hatchlings of _T. s.\r\nasper_ can be distinguished by the pattern on the carapace. Slight\r\nontogenetic variation occurs in some proportional measurements. Large\r\nskulls of _ferox_ and some _asper_ (those in Atlantic Coast drainages)\r\nhave expanded crushing surfaces on the jaws. Considering osteological\r\ncharacters, _muticus_ is most distinct; there is less difference between\r\n_ferox_ and _spinifer_ than between those species and _muticus_.\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ is monotypic, confined to the southeastern United States, and\r\nresembles Old World softshells more than it does any American species.\r\nThe northern part of the geographic range of _ferox_ overlaps that of\r\n_T. s. asper_; there, the two species are ecologically isolated. _T.\r\nspinifer_ is polytypic, has the largest geographic range, and is\r\ncomposed of six subspecies, of which two are described as new\r\n(_pallidus_ and _guadalupensis_). The subspecies are divisible into two\r\ngroups. One, the _spinifer_ group (_spinifer_, _hartwegi_ and _asper_)\r\nis recognized by a juvenal pattern having black spots or ocelli; _asper_\r\nis the most distinctive and shows little evidence of intergradation in\r\nthe lower Mississippi River drainage with the _spinifer-hartwegi_\r\ncomplex, which, northward, is differentiated into two subspecies in\r\nwhich there is an east-west cline in size of the ocelli on the carapace.\r\nThe _emoryi_ group (_pallidus_, _guadalupensis_, _emoryi_) is recognized\r\nby a pattern of white spots; _emoryi_ is most distinctive. Each of\r\nseveral characters behaves as a cline if traced from east to west\r\nthrough the three subspecies. _T. s. pallidus_ intergrades with the\r\n_spinifer-hartwegi_ complex in the lower Mississippi River drainage. _T.\r\ns. emoryi_ is the most variable subspecies; in its most notable\r\npopulation the males have orange coloration. _T. s. emoryi_ has been\r\nintroduced into the Colorado River drainage of Arizona. _T. ater_ most\r\nclosely resembles _T. s. emoryi_, but shows alliance with _T. muticus_\r\nand _T. ferox_. _T. ater_ is confined to ponds of crystal-clear water in\r\ncentral Coahuila, México. _T. muticus_ is completely sympatric with\r\n_spinifer_, and is composed of two subspecies (_muticus_ and\r\n_calvatus_). _T. m. calvatus_ shows no evidence of intergradation in the\r\nlower Mississippi River drainage with _T. m. muticus_, corresponding\r\nsomewhat to the relationship of _T. s. asper_ with the intergradient\r\npopulation of _T. spinifer_ in the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nSoftshells have pharyngeal respiration and probably are incapacitated by\r\nrotenone. _T. ferox_ and the subspecies of _spinifer_ occur in a wide\r\nvariety of fresh-water habitats; _muticus_ is more nearly restricted to\r\nrunning water (especially in the northern parts of its range) than\r\n_spinifer_, and may be less vagile than _spinifer_. _T. ferox_ is more\r\ntolerant of marine and brackish waters than are _muticus_ or _spinifer_.\r\nSmall size and pallid coloration seem correlated with arid environments.\r\nThe largest species (_ferox_) and the smallest population of _spinifer_\r\n(resembling _muticus_) both occur in the southernmost part of the range\r\nof the genus. Diurnal habits include basking on shores or débris in\r\nwater, floating at the surface, procuring food, and burrowing in shallow\r\nand deep water (no observations for _spinifer_ and _muticus_ in deep\r\nwater). Softshells are principally carnivorous; the food consists mostly\r\nof crawfish and insects; there is evidence of cannibalism involving\r\npredation on first- and second-year-old turtles. The capture of food is\r\ntriggered primarily by movement of prey; sight seems to be more\r\nimportant than smell to _Trionyx_ in capturing food. There is no\r\nindication of a food preference between species; enlarged crushing\r\nsurfaces of jaws in some _ferox_ and _asper_ may be an adaptation for\r\nfeeding on mollusks. Schools of fish are reported to follow softshells,\r\nand presumably acquire food that is dislodged by the grubbing and\r\nscurrying of the turtles on the bottom. Softshells are wary. They are\r\ngood swimmers, and travel rapidly on land. The depressed body is an\r\nadaptation for burrowing and concealment. Permanent growths of algae do\r\nnot occur on the dorsal surface of softshells. There is evidence of some\r\nnocturnal activity, and a general parallel in habits between trionychids\r\nand chelydrids. Softshells sometimes move overland; they move little in\r\naquatic habitats. The normal annual period of activity of _spinifer_ in\r\nlatitudes 40° to 43° is approximately five months from April into\r\nSeptember, depending on the weather; they hibernate under a shallow\r\ncovering of mud in deep water. The southernmost populations may be\r\nactive throughout the year.\r\n\r\nMales of _spinifer_ are sexually mature when the plastron is 9.0 to 10.0\r\ncentimeters in length (some when 8.0 long), whereas those of _muticus_\r\nare sexually mature at 8.0 to 9.0 centimeters. In the mentioned size\r\nrange, the smaller adult males are probably in their fourth growing\r\nseason, and the larger males in their fifth. Most females of _spinifer_\r\nare sexually mature at a plastral length of 18.0 to 20.0 centimeters and\r\nare probably in their ninth year; the smaller individuals probably are\r\nin their eighth. Females of _muticus_ are sexually mature when the\r\nplastron is 14.0 to 16.0 centimeters long. Most of these are seven years\r\nold but some are only six years old. Some large females contain immature\r\novaries. The near-maximum length of carapace of _spinifer_ is 18 inches,\r\nand such turtles are perhaps 60 years old; _ferox_ perhaps attains a\r\nlength of two feet.\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_ deposits eggs from late March to mid-July, whereas northern\r\npopulations of _spinifer_ and _muticus_ usually deposit theirs from\r\nmid-June to mid-July. Sandy sites are preferred for nests, although\r\nmovement to other sites occurs if the preferred sandy sites are\r\nsubmerged or otherwise rendered unusable. _T. muticus_ limits its nest\r\nsites to the open areas of sand bars and does not lay inland where it\r\nmust traverse vegetated areas, as does _spinifer_. Nests of _ferox_ and\r\n_spinifer_ seem to differ from those of _muticus_ in being flask-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe seasonal reproductive potential is perhaps less in northern\r\npopulations (averaging 20 eggs per clutch and only one clutch per\r\nseason) than in southern populations (averaging about 10 eggs per\r\nclutch, but three clutches per season). Larger females deposit more eggs\r\nthan smaller females. Eggs laid in northern latitudes are slightly\r\nsmaller than those laid farther south. In any latitude the incubation\r\nperiod probably is at least 60 days. Hatchlings presumably leave nests\r\nat dusk, nighttime or dawn, and may winter over in eggs or nests.\r\n\r\nMan is a great enemy of softshells. Predation on eggs probably accounts\r\nfor most mortality. Physical conditions of the environment (overcrowding\r\nof nest sites, inadequate hibernation sites) and probably some kinds of\r\nparasitism contribute to mortality. Softshells are eaten locally and\r\nsometimes appear in the market of large cities, but over most of their\r\nrange, there probably is no general demand and no special efforts are\r\nmade to capture them. Fish, mostly minnows, comprise a small proportion\r\nof the diet. There is no evidence that softshells are active predators\r\non any kind of fish, but their known food habits suggest that they\r\ncompete with game fishes for food. Softshells are scavengers.\r\n\r\nFossil material was not studied in detail. The fossil softshells\r\nindicate a more widespread, former distribution. Some osteological\r\ncharacters and their variation in the living species are mentioned as an\r\naid to future workers concerned with an assay of fossil remains. Fossils\r\noccur in marine, brackish and fresh-water deposits, and many are much\r\nlarger than the living species; the oldest American fossils are of Upper\r\nCretaceous age.\r\n\r\nThe interrelationships of the living species and subspecies suggest that\r\nthe species _spinifer_, _ater_, and _muticus_ are derivatives of a\r\n_ferox_-like ancestor, and that they differentiated in North America;\r\nmost differentiation occurs in southwestern Texas and northern México\r\nwhere characters of some populations indicate alliance with _ferox_. It\r\nis hypothesized that aridity in the late Tertiary effected specific\r\ndifferentiation by the modification and isolation of aquatic habitats.\r\nPluvial periods in the Pleistocene provided for confluence of aquatic\r\nhabitats and expansion of geographic ranges, and coupled with\r\nphysiographic changes, conceivably caused or enhanced some of the\r\nsubspecific variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences marked with an asterisk were not seen by the author.\r\n\r\n    ADAMS, M.
